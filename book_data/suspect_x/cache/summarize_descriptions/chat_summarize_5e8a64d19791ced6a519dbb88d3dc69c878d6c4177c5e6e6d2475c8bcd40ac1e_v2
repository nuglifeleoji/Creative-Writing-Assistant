Known for his greed, cruelty, and political ambition, the Baron orchestrated numerous military and political maneuvers to secure power, including the temporary control of **Arrakis**. His legacy is one of vengeance and tyranny, making him a defining villain in the Atreides lineage.  \n\nThe Baron's influence extends beyond his lifetime, haunting future generations as an **ancestral memory**â€”particularly within **Leto II** and **Alia Atreides**. In Leto, he represents a dark past, serving as a contrast to the God Emperor's rule. For Alia, his persona becomes a malevolent force, possessing her and contributing to her eventual downfall. His presence lingers as a psychological and spiritual threat, embodying the enduring enmity between the Harkonnens and Atreides.  \n\nAs **Paul Atreides' grandfather**, the Baron's actions cast a long shadow over the Atreides family, reinforcing his role as a pivotal antagonist in their history.
