Originating from the Scattering, they were initially kept and utilized by the **Honored Matres**, though they exhibit resistance to breeding and commands, making them difficult to control. Despite their association with the Honored Matres, the Futars are also described as potential allies of the **Bene Gesserit** in the conflict against their former masters, as they were allegedly created to hunt and kill Honored Matres.  \n\nFutars are dangerous and require specialized **Handlers**, who appear human but have mysterious origins. These Handlers are essential for managing the creatures, as Futars are unpredictable and capable of speech, often displaying terrifying behavior. Their dual nature—both as tools of the Honored Matres and as possible adversaries—suggests a complex role in the power struggles of their universe.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize their ferocity and animalistic traits, others highlight their strategic importance as potential allies against the Honored Matres. Despite contradictions in their allegiance, the Futars remain formidable, enigmatic beings, feared for their savagery yet valued for their unique capabilities in combat and hunting. Their origins, purpose, and loyalties remain subjects of intrigue, positioning them as key players in the broader conflict.\",5\r\n1227,HANDLERS,\"The HANDLERS are individuals from the Scattering who are closely associated with the Futars, acting as their companions, managers, and, in some cases, commanders. The Futars themselves have requested to be taken to the Handlers, indicating a voluntary but dependent relationship. While the Handlers appear human, they exhibit odd characteristics that raise suspicions about their origins, with some speculation suggesting they may be Face Dancers. Despite these uncertainties, they are described as respectful and well-liked by the Futars.  \n\nHowever, their role is not entirely benign. Some accounts describe the Handlers as controllers who command the Futars to kill, implying a hierarchical and possibly coercive dynamic. This duality—being both caretakers and commanders—suggests a complex relationship between the two groups. The Handlers' origins in the Scattering further complicate their identity, as they may represent a distinct faction with their own agenda.  \n\nIn summary, the Handlers are enigmatic figures who oversee the Futars with a mix of guidance and authority. Their human-like appearance belies potential non-human traits, and their interactions with the Futars range from mutual respect to outright control, depending on the context. Their exact nature and motives remain ambiguous, but they play a pivotal role in the Futars' actions and allegiances.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2846,FUTARS,HANDLERS,\"Futars are accompanied and managed by Handlers, with whom they share mutual respect and liking.\",7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
