This gesture highlights the emotional bond between them, suggesting that the hat serves not only as a physical item but also as a source of reassurance and safety for 小吴. The act of giving the straw hat signifies 运生's desire to shield 小吴 from distress, reinforcing their connection through this meaningful exchange.\n\nConversely, the straw hat is also offered by 吴月琴 to 运生, symbolizing care and a deep connection between the two. This act of gifting further emphasizes the hat's role as a token of affection and support, illustrating the nurturing aspect of their relationship. The hat, in this context, embodies the warmth and concern that 吴月琴 feels for 运生, suggesting that it is a bridge that strengthens their emotional ties.\n\nOverall, the \"草帽\" emerges as a multifaceted symbol within these relationships, representing not only protection and comfort but also care and connection.
