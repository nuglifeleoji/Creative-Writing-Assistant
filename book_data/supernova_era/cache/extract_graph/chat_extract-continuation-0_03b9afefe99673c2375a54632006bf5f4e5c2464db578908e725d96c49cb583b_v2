美里战战兢兢的从男人身上起来，制服裙变得皱巴巴。她跌坐在地，倚着墙壁，看着富坚。\n    母女俩沉默了好一阵子，两人的视线都在不会动的男人身上，唯有荧光灯吱吱作响的声音分外响亮地传入靖子耳中。\n    “怎么办……”靖子喃喃自语。脑袋一片空白，“我杀了她。”\n    “妈……”\n    这个声音，令靖子的目光转向女儿。美里的脸颊惨白，但双眼充血，下方犹有泪痕。靖子不知道她是什么时候流的泪。\n    靖子再次看着富坚，即希望他起死回生又不太希望他复活的复杂心情占据了她的心头，不过看来他的确是活不过来了。\n    “是这家伙……自己不好。”美里屈起腿，抱着双膝。她把脸往两膝中间一埋，开始嘤嘤啜泣。\n    怎么办――就在靖子再次呢喃时，门铃响了。她太过惊惶，以致全身像痉挛似的颤抖。\n    美里也仰起脸，这次泪水已经湿遍双颊。母女俩面面相处，彼此都在问对方，这个时候会是谁――\n    紧接着响起敲门声，然后是男人的声音，“花冈小姐。”\n    这个声音很耳熟。可是靖子一时之间想不起是谁。她像中邪般动弹不得，一直和女儿继续对视。\n    敲门声再次响起，“花冈小姐，花冈小姐。”\n    门外的人，似乎知道靖子她们在家。她没道理不去应门，可是这种状态下不能开门。\n    “你去里面待着。把门关上，绝对不准出来。”靖子小声命令美里，思考力总算一点一点回来了。\n    敲门声再次响起，靖子深呼一口气。\n    “来了。”她发出刻意保持平静的声音，这已是她竭尽所能的演技了。“哪位？”\n    “啊，我是隔壁的石神。”\n    听到这里，靖子吓了一跳。刚才她们发出的声音，想必非比寻常。邻居不可能不起疑心，所以石神才决定过来看看情况吧。\n    “来了，请稍等一下。”她自认声音一如往常，但也不确定自己是否伪装的很好。\n    美里早已进入里屋，关上纸门。靖子看着富坚的尸体，必须想办法处理这个。\n    暖桌的位置歪的很厉害，大概是因为刚才拉扯电线的关系。她把暖桌往更旁边推，用桌被盖住尸体。虽然位置有点不自然，但也别无他法了。\n    靖子确认自己身上毫无一样后，走下门口拖鞋处。富坚肮脏的鞋子引入眼帘，她连忙将鞋子塞到鞋柜下面。\n    她悄然无声的偷偷挂上门链，刚才门没有锁，她暗\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
