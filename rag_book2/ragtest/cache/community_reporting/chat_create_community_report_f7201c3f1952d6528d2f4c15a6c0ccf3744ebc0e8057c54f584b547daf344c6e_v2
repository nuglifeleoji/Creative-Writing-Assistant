The apartment, specifically unit 103, was the site of a tragic gas poisoning incident that resulted in 西本文代's death.  \n\nThe building is described as old and dilapidated, primarily housing elderly residents in later years. It served as the residence for 西本雪穗 during her childhood before she moved out and eventually took on the surname **唐泽 (Karasawa)**. The gas poisoning event at 吉田公寓 is a significant incident tied to the lives of both 西本文代 and 西本雪穗.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its current state as a rundown building mostly occupied by older residents, others focus on its historical role in the lives of the Nishimoto family. There are no major contradictions in the descriptions, only varying emphases on different aspects—its condition, its residents, and the pivotal event that occurred there.  \n\nIn summary, **吉田公寓** is an aging, poorly maintained apartment complex known for being the former home of 西本文代 and 西本雪穗, as well as the site of 西本文代's fatal gas poisoning.
