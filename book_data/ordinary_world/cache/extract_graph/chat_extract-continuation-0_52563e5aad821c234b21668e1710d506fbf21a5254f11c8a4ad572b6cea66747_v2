上，冯世宽没等大家说话，他自己先严肃地对这件事进行了批判性分析发言。在发言中间，他停顿了一下，立刻指示一名常委出去给各公社打电话，看其它公社有没有出现类似的情况；如果出现，要立即制止，狠狠批判，严厉打击！ \n　　冯世宽发完言后，李登云和马国雄接着发言，坚决支持冯主任的意见。但副主任田福军提出，县革委会能不能心平气静地研究一下这个新情况呢？另外，是否可以不必忙着处理这事？他建议先由县、社、队三级组成一个联合调查组，把具体问题调查清楚再做结论也不迟！ \n　　田福军由这个问题，转而很沉痛地论述了全县的农业生产情况。他大胆地指出，他们村子出现的这个情况，也许能反映了全县农民的一种情绪。孙少安的这种做法是否正确，可以讨论；但目前农村既然已经贫困至极，人们就得想办法维持自己的生存。作为管农业的副主任，田福军立刻给常委们摆出了一滩数字：一九五三年全县人均生产粮九百斤，而去年下降到六百斤，少了近三分之一。从五八年到七七年的二十年间，有十六个年头社员平均口粮都不足三百五十斤；去年仅有三百一十五斤，而其中三百斤以下的就有二百四十一个大队、四万一千多人，占全县人口的三分之一。四九年人均生产油品九斤二两，去年下降为一斤九两……社员收入低微、负债累累，缺吃少穿。劳动日值只有二、三角钱，每户平均现金收入只有三、四十元。超支欠款的达二千三百户。去年国家贷款金额近一千万元，人均欠款五十多元。社员欠集体储备粮一千三百多万斤、相当于全县近一年的征购任务…… \n　　田福军罗列完这些数字后，痛心地说：“我们是解放四十多年的老革命根据地，建国已经快三十年了，人民公社化也已经二十年了，我们不仅没有使农民富起来，反而连吃饭都成了问题……” \n　　田福军发完言后，常委们都沉默了。 \n　　大家知道，他说的是事实。但事实归事实，问题归问题。 \n　　归根结底，总不能让农民去走资本主义道路吧？ \n　　冯世宽的激动情绪也平息了一些。他沉吟了一会，说：“你们先谈着，让我打个电话，把双水村的情况向地区领导汇报一下，看上级有什么指示……”说完他就出去了。 \n　　一刻钟以后，冯世宽回到了会议室。他向常委们传达了地区革委会主任苗凯同志的指示：坚决制止！ \n　　这是“终审判决”。大家都再不言语了。 \n　　常委会决定：立刻通知石圪节公社，坚决制止双水村的资本主义复辟倾向。对于当事人孙少安，因其计划在事实上还没有实行，不予处分；但责成公社通过适当的方式，严肃批评教育这\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
