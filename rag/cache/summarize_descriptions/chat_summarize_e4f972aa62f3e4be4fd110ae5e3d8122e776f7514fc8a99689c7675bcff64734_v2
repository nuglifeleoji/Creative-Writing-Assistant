While the Duke's new role grants him control over Arrakis—a critical hub for spice production—he harbors a deep longing for his former home, Caladan. The move is a strategic maneuver to consolidate power by overseeing the lucrative spice trade, which holds immense economic and military value. Despite the political advantages, Leto's personal attachment to Caladan underscores the emotional weight of his transition, revealing a tension between duty and sentiment.
