But the scene vanished and Ghanima stood in front of him, saying: “Gurney knows. He told me. They’re Duncan’s words and Duncan was speaking as a mentat. ‘In doing good, avoid notoriety; in doing evil, avoid self-awareness. ’”\nThat had to be future—far future. But he felt the reality. It was as intense as any past from his multitude of lives. And he whispered: “Isn’t that true, father?”\nBut the father-presence within spoke warningly: “Don’t invite disaster! You’re learning stroboscopic awareness now. Without it you could overrun yourself, lose your place-mark in Time.”\nAnd the bas-relief imagery persisted. Intrusions hammered at him. Past-present-now. There was no true separation. He knew he had to flow with this thing, but the flowing terrified him. How could he return to any recognizable place? Yet he felt himself being forced to cease every effort of resistance. He could not grasp his new universe in motionless, labeled bits. No bit would stand still. Things could not be forever ordered and formulated. He had to find the rhythm of change and see between the changes to the changing itself. Without knowing where it began he found himself moving within a gigantic moment bienheureux, able to see the past in the future, present in past, the now in both past and future. It was the\naccumulation of centuries experienced between one heartbeat and the next.\nLeto’s awareness floated free, no objective psyche to compensate for consciousness, no barriers. Namri’s “provisional future” remained lightly in his memory, but it Shared awareness with many futures. And in this shattering awareness, all of his past, every inner life became his own. With the help of the greatest within him, he dominated. They were his.\nHe thought: When you study an object from a distance, only its principle may be seen. He had achieved the distance and he could see his own life now: the multi-past and its memories were his burden, his joy, and his necessity. But the worm trip had added another dimension and his father no longer stood guard within him because the need no longer existed. Leto saw through the distances clearly— past and present. And the past presented him with an ultimate ancestor—one who was called Harum and without whom the distant future would not be. These clear distances provided new principles, new dimensions of sharing. Whichever life he now chose, he’d live it out in an autonomous sphere of mass experience, a trail of lives so convoluted that no single lifetime could count the generations of it. Aroused, this mass experience held the power to subdue his selfdom. It could make itself felt upon an individual, a nation, a society or an entire civilization. That, of course, was why Gurney had been taught to fear him; why Namri’s knife waited. They could not be allowed to see this power within him. No one could ever see it in its fullness—not even Ghanima.\nPresently Leto sat up, saw that only Namri remained, watching.\nIn an old voice, Leto said: “There’s no single set of limits for all men. Universal prescience is an empty myth. Only the most powerful local currents of Time may be foretold. But in\nan infinite universe, /oca/ can be so gigantic that your mind Shrinks from it.”\nNamri shook his head, not understanding.\n“Where’s Gurney?” Leto asked.\n“He left lest he have to watch me slay you.”\n“Will you slay me, Namri?” It was almost a plea to have the man do it.\nNamri took his hand from his knife. “Since you ask me to do it, | will not. If you were indifferent, though...”\n“The malady of indifference is what destroys many things,” Leto said. He nodded to himself. “Yes ... even civilizations die of it. It’s as though that were the price demanded for achieving new levels of complexity or consciousness.” He looked up at Namri. “So they told you to look for indifference in me?” And he saw Namri was more than a killer—Namri was devious.\n“As a sign of unbridled power,” Namri said, but it was a lie.\n“Indifferent power, yes.” Leto sat up, sighed deeply. “There was no moral grandeur to my father’s life, Namri; only a local trap which he built for himself.”\nO Paul, thou Muad’Dib, Mahdi of all men, Thy breath exhaled Sent forth the huricen.\n—SONGS OF MUAD'DIB\nll N ever!” Ghanima said. “I'd kill him on our wedding\nnight.” She spoke with a barbed stubbornness which thus far had resisted all blandishments. Alia and her advisors had been at it half the night, keeping the royal quarters in a state of unrest, sending out for new advisors, for food and drink. The entire Temple and its adjoining Keep seethed with the frustrations of unmade decisions.\nGhanima sat composedly on a green floater chair in her own quarters, a large room with rough tan walls to simulate sietch rock. The ceiling, however, was imbar crystal which flickered with blue light, and the floor was black tile. The furnishings were sparse: a small writing table, five floater chairs and a narrow cot set into an alcove, Fremen fashion. Ghanima wore a robe of yellow mourning.\n“You are not a free person who can settle every aspect of her own life,” Alia said for perhaps the hundredth time. The little fool must come to realize this sooner or later! She must approve the betrothal to Farad’n. She must! Let her kill him later, but the betrothal requires open acknowledgment by the Fremen affianced.\n“He killed my brother,” Ghanima said, holding to the single note which sustained her. “Everyone knows this. Fremen would spit at the mention of my name were I to consent to this betrothal.”\nAnd that is one of the reasons why you must consent, Alia thought. She said: “His mother did it. He has banished her for it. What more do you want of him?”\n“His blood,” Ghanima said. “He’s a Corrino.”\n“He has denounced his own mother,” Alia protested. “And why should you worry about the Fremen rabble? They'll accept whatever we tell them to accept. Ghani, the peace of the Empire demands that—”\n“I will not consent,” Ghanima said. “You cannot announce the betrothal without me.”\nlrulan, entering the room as Ghanima spoke, glanced inquiringly at Alia and the two female advisors who stood dejectedly beside her. Irulan saw Alia throw up her arms in disgust and drop into a chair facing Ghanima.\n“You speak to her, Irulan,” Alia said.\nlrulan pulled a floater into place, sat down beside Alia.\n“You're a Corrino, Irulan,” Ghanima said. “Don’t press your luck with me.” Ghanima got up, crossed to her cot and sat on it cross-legged, glaring back at the women. Irulan, she saw, had dressed in a black aba to match Alia’s, the hood thrown back to reveal her golden hair. It was mourning hair under the yellow glow of the floating globes which illuminated the room.\nlrulan glanced at Alia, stood up and crossed to stand facing Ghanima. “Ghani, I’d kill him myself if that were the way to solve matters. And Farad’n’s my own blood, as you so kindly emphasized. But you have duties far higher than your commitment to Fremen.. .”\n“That doesn’t sound any better coming from you than it does from my precious aunt,” Ghanima said. “The blood of a brother cannot be washed off. That’s more than some little Fremen aphorism.”\nlrulan pressed her lips together. Then: “Farad’n holds your grandmother captive. He holds Duncan and if we don’t—”\n“I’m not satisfied with your stories of how all this happened,” Ghanima said, peering past Irulan at Alia. “Once\nDuncan died rather than let enemies take my father. Perhaps this new ghola-flesh is no longer the same as—”\n“Duncan was charged with protecting your grandmother’s life!” Alia said, whirling in her chair. “I’m confident he chose the only way to do that.” And she thought: Duncan! Duncan! You weren’t supposed to do it this way.\nGhanima, reading the overtones of contrivance in Alia’s voice, stared across at her aunt. “You're lying, O Womb of Heaven. I’ve heard about your fight with my grandmother. What is it you fear to tell us about her and your precious Duncan?”\n“You've heard it all,” Alia said, but she felt a stab of fear at this bald accusation and what it implied. Fatigue had made her careless, she realized. She arose, said: “Everything | know, you know.” Turning to Irulan: “You work on her. She must be made to—”\nGhanima interrupted with a coarse Fremen expletive which came shockingly from the immature lips. Into the quick silence she said: “You think me just a mere child, that you have years in which to work on me, that eventually l'Il accept. Think again, O Heavenly Regent. You know better than anyone the years | have within me. l'Il listen to them, not to you.”\nAlia barely suppressed an angry retort, stared hard at Ghanima. Abomination? Who was this child? A new fear of Ghanima began to rise in Alia. Had she accepted her own compromise with the lives which came to her pre-born? Alia said: “There’s time yet for you to see reason.”\n“There may be time yet for me to see Farad’n’s blood spurt around my knife,” Ghanima said. “Depend on it. If I’m ever left alone with him, one of us will surely die.”\n“You think you loved your brother more than |?” Irulan demanded. “You play a fool’s game! | was mother to him as | was to you. | was—”\n“You never knew him,” Ghanima said. “All of you, except at times my beloved aunt, persist in thinking us children.\nYou're the fools! Alia knows! Look at her run away from...”\n“I run from nothing,” Alia said, but she turned her back on lrulan and Ghanima, and stared at the two amazons who were pretending not to hear this argument. They’d obviously given up on Ghanima. Perhaps they sympathized with her. Angrily, Alia sent them from the room. Relief was obvious on their faces as they obeyed.\n“You run,” Ghanima persisted.\n“I’ve chosen a way of life which suits me,” Alia said, turning back to stare at Ghanima sitting cross-legged on the cot. Was it possible she’d made that terrible inner compromise? Alia tried to see the signs of it in Ghanima, but was unable to read a single betrayal. Alia wondered then: Has she seen it in me? But how could she?\n“You feared to be the window for a multitude,” Ghanima accused. “But we're the pre-born and we know. You'll be their window, conscious or unconscious. You cannot deny them.” And she thought: Yes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a central character experiencing a complex awareness of time and multiple lives, with a deep connection to his father and other ancestral figures.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is Leto's sister, a pre-born with ancestral memories, resisting political betrothal and displaying strong Fremen values.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMRI<|>PERSON<|>Namri is a Fremen tasked with potentially killing Leto, embodying deviousness and cultural loyalty.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURNEY<|>PERSON<|>Gurney Halleck is a loyal retainer and mentor figure, feared by Leto for his knowledge and intentions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is the regent and aunt to Leto and Ghanima, struggling with political and internal conflicts as a pre-born.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>Irulan is a Corrino princess and political advisor, mediating between factions and advocating for the Empire's stability.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARAD’N<|>PERSON<|>Farad’n is a Corrino heir, implicated in the death of Ghanima's brother and a contentious figure in political negotiations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARUM<|>PERSON<|>Harum is an ultimate ancestor of Leto, pivotal to the distant future's unfolding.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL MUAD'DIB<|>PERSON<|>Paul Atreides, Leto's father, is a revered and tragic figure whose legacy influences current events.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola and loyal protector, caught in political and personal conflicts.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a desert-dwelling people with strict cultural codes, central to the political and social dynamics.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORRINO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Corrino are a former ruling family, still influential and entangled in power struggles.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPLE<|>GEO<|>The Temple is a significant location where political and religious decisions are made, adjacent to the Keep.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEEP<|>GEO<|>The Keep is a fortified structure near the Temple, housing royal quarters and strategic meetings.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH<|>GEO<|>Sietches are Fremen cave dwellings, culturally and strategically important.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BETROTHAL<|>EVENT<|>The betrothal is a contentious political event intended to unite factions but resisted by Ghanima.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSTAGE EXCHANGE<|>EVENT<|>A referenced event involving hostages and political negotiations, though not detailed in the text.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GHANIMA<|>Leto and Ghanima are siblings, sharing pre-born abilities and ancestral memories.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>NAMRI<|>Namri is tasked with potentially killing Leto, reflecting a tense and dangerous relationship.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GURNEY<|>Gurney fears Leto's power and is a mentor figure, creating a complex dynamic.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ALIA<|>Alia is Leto's aunt and regent, with underlying tensions and power struggles.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>ALIA<|>Ghanima resists Alia's political machinations, especially the betrothal to Farad’n.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>FARAD’N<|>Ghanima vehemently opposes Farad’n due to his role in her brother's death.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>IRULAN<|>Alia and Irulan collaborate on political strategies, though with differing motivations.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRULAN<|>FARAD’N<|>Irulan is a Corrino relative of Farad’n, mediating his conflicts with Ghanima.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>HARUM<|>Harum is an ancestral figure pivotal to Leto's understanding of his multi-past.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>PAUL MUAD'DIB<|>Paul is Leto's father, whose legacy and presence deeply influence Leto.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>FREMEN<|>Alia interacts with Fremen culture and politics, though her actions sometimes conflict with their values.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>FREMEN<|>Ghanima strongly identifies with Fremen values, influencing her resistance to the betrothal.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEMPLE<|>KEEP<|>The Temple and Keep are adjacent structures central to political and religious activities.<|>7\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
