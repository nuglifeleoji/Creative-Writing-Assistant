\n　　她不想回村里找少安。村里人都认识，两个人不好多接触；再说少安常出山劳动，也没机会。晚上更不行。农村不象城里，两个男女晚上呆在一块说话，闲言碎语不光双水村，整个石圪节公社都会传得风一股雨一股。 \n　　最好是少安到城里来！这里人生，并且男女在一块是惯常的，不会引起别人的飞短流长……当她听她弟润生说，少安的弟弟少平也来上高中的时候，她就很快想到让少平给他哥捎个话。于是她就到中学找了一趟少平。她看见少平和他哥长得一模一样，心里对这孩子也产生了一种说不出的心疼。她看见他穿得破破烂烂，感到非常难过。她想起当年少安上学时，也就穿这样的破衣服。她立刻把自己省下的五十斤粮票都给了少平，还把她这个月剩下的全部工资也给他了……现在，田润叶坐在炉灶前，还是没有动筷子。 \n　　她不想吃饭。她想着少安。她焦急地等待着他来。已经两天过去了，他还没有来！少平明明给她说，他答应这两天就来。可“这两天”已经过去了，他为什么还不来？少安！少安！她在心里不断地呼叫着他的名字……润叶这两天没有回二爸家吃饭去。晚上她也睡在学校的宿舍里。她怕万一少安来了找不见她——她捎话让他直接到学校来找她…… \n　　这两天，她坐在学校的宿舍里，只要门外有脚步声，她的心就一阵狂跳。有两次她听见有人敲门，就赶快迎到门口，原来是她们学校的女老师叫她去参加政治学习，让她败兴极了。 \n　　她现在把衣服也换转了，换上了一身洗得发白的蓝制服罩衣，看起来朴素多了。她知道少安没有一身象样的衣服，她的衣服要叫他看起来不拘束才行。她还让与她关系要好的一个女老师，把她的两根漂亮的辫子剪成了短帽盖，只用一根绿毛线扎了一绺头发，看起来既朴实又显得成熟了一些，这使她很满意。所有这些精心的准备都是为了那个人——可他现在还迟迟不到！ \n　　她伸出手，摸了摸她面前的饭碗。碗在火边烤着，还很烫手。她又摸了摸放在碗筷上面的玉米面馍，已经冰凉了。她想，不吃饭也不行，总得凑合着吃一点。 \n　　她刚端起碗，就听见有人敲她的门。她一把将碗撂在炉灶上，也不管闪手撒了一炉灶菜，就跑过去开门。还没等她把门打开，她妹妹晓霞就咯咯地笑着闯进来了。润叶心一凉，说：“\n######################\nOutput:",
