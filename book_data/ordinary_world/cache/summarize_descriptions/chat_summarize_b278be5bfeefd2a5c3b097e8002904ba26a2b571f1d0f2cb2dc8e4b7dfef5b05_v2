It serves as a gathering place for miners after their shifts, providing a space for them to come together and discuss their work experiences. As the mining department, 矿部 is responsible for hiring new workers and overseeing all aspects of mining operations, ensuring that the workforce is adequately managed and supported.\n\nIn addition to its administrative functions, 矿部 plays a crucial role in addressing the concerns and suggestions of the miners. For instance, it acted upon 孙少平's recommendations regarding miner attendance and the implementation of penalties, demonstrating its responsiveness to the needs of the workforce. This highlights the department's commitment to maintaining a fair and efficient working environment.\n\nFurthermore, 矿部 is where characters like 晓霞 communicate their intentions and plans related to mining activities, such as informing the staff about her plans to go down the mine. This illustrates the department's role as a communication hub within the mining community, facilitating the flow of information between miners and management.\n\nOverall, 矿部 is not only the administrative center for the mining operations but also a vital location where the daily lives and work of the miners intersect.
