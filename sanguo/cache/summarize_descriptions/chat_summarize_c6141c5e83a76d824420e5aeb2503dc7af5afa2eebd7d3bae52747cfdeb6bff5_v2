His role primarily involved providing counsel on military matters, particularly during times of crisis. 黄皓's advice was crucial in navigating the challenges faced by the Shu Han, especially in the context of ongoing conflicts with rival states.\n\nOne of the notable aspects of 黄皓's advisory role was his frequent conflict with the general 姜维. This tension arose from differing military strategies and approaches to governance. While 黄皓 often advocated for certain military tactics and decisions, 姜维, known for his own military acumen, sometimes disagreed with 黄皓's recommendations. This rivalry highlighted the complexities of leadership and decision-making within the Shu Han court, as both figures sought to influence the direction of military campaigns and the overall strategy of the state.\n\nIn summary, 黄皓 served as a key military advisor to 后主, providing critical counsel during a tumultuous period for the Shu Han dynasty. His interactions with other military leaders, particularly 姜维, underscored the challenges of governance and the intricacies of military strategy during this era.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754899498, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
