Duncan Idaho, a skilled warrior and loyal retainer, serves as one of Paul's primary trainers, imparting combat skills and strategic insights. Paul, in turn, observes Duncan closely, particularly in his interactions with the Fremen, learning from his adaptability and diplomacy.  \n\nWhile Duncan remembers Paul as a prescient and occasionally arrogant figure, this perception does not diminish his unwavering loyalty.

Their dynamic reflects a blend of mentorship and deep trust, with Duncan's influence shaping Paul's growth as a leader. Despite any perceived arrogance, their bond remains foundational to Paul's development and eventual rise to power.  \n\nIn summary, Duncan Idaho is both a teacher and a devoted ally to Paul, whose prescient abilities and occasional arrogance are tempered by his reliance on Duncan's guidance.
