村干脆包产到户了；而公社所在地石圪节大队却仍然坚持他们的大集体生产方式……在双水村田家圪崂一队生产责任组搞得热火朝天的时候，金家湾那边的二队却按兵不动。这当然是有原因的。金家湾这面的人中农以上成份的居多，合作化时他们不积极，许多人因此被收拾得多年抬不起头。现在又要把集体往开分，他们一时鼓不起这种勇气。当年因为对集体化不积极而受到的批判，仍然记忆犹新；现在怎么敢贸然把集体弄散伙呢？ \n　　不过，说实话，金家湾许多人的心都被田家圪崂分队分乱了。他们激动地注视着东拉河对岸所发生的一切。他们心里盘算：如果一队的责任组成为事实而存在下去，不久他们也许就能步其后尘了。 \n　　紧接着时令就到了耕翻麦田的时候，金家湾的人看见，田家圪崂那面的人象发了疯似的，起早贪黑，不光把麦田比往年多耕了一遍，还把集体多年荒芜了的地畔地楞全部拿镢头挖过，将肥土刮在地里。麦田整得像棉花包一般松软，边畔刮得像狗舔得一般干净。哈呀，这些家伙是种地哩还是绣花哩？瞧，所有的秋田不仅锄了三遍草，还又多施了一次化肥！不得了！这样干下去，用不了几年，田家圪崂许多人家要发得流油呀！金家湾的人眼发红，手发痒，心里象钻进去了许多毛毛虫…… \n　　往日吵吵闹闹的田家圪崂，现在一整天鸦雀无声，再也看不见什么闲散人，甚至连女人和娃娃都到地里拼命去了。 \n　　可是田福堂却关住门，一整天躺在土炕上不起来。他不时地闻纸烟，闻罢后又咳嗽老半天。他难受，从内心深处说，他难受的不仅是集体被弄散伙了，而最主要的是，集体散伙了，他田福堂怎么办？” \n　　是呀，多少年了，他靠集体活得舒心爽气，家业发达。他能不热爱集体吗？没有了集体，也就没有了他田福堂的好日子；他的命运和集体息息相关。如今让他也上山握老镢把吗？他已经多年不摸劳动工具；况且这把干骨头，又有气管炎，怎么能一年四季山里土洼里下呢？ \n　　在土炕上躺了几天以后，田福堂实在憋闷得不行，就一个人起身到石圪节去赶集散心。走到石圪节街上，田福堂看见集市也和往年大不一样了，不知从哪里冒出那么多的东西和那么多不三不四的生意人！年轻人穿着喇叭裤，个把小伙子头发留得象马鬃一般长。年轻女人的头发都用“电打”了，卷得象个绵羊尾巴。瞧\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
