\n　　红梅感动得不断用围裙揩眼泪。她把润生敬让到她的热炕头上，精心给他做了几碗香喷喷的细面条，还把给孩子留下的几颗鸡蛋，全部打进了调汤里。 \n　　润生临走时，她把自己卖饺子积攒的十几块钱，硬往他口袋里塞。她知道这十几块钱也不够开销润生给她带来的这些东西。但她总不能白白接受人家的礼物啊！ \n　　润生死活不收，最后还是把钱硬给她留下了。他说：“如果我要收你的钱，我也不会给你送这些东西来。你日子过得这么清苦，我想帮助你。我要是顺路，还会来的……”红梅含着感激的泪水送走了好心的同学。 \n　　打这以后，过些日子，润生就把汽车开到了坡底下。他每次来，总要给她和孩子带点什么；甚至把城里的酱油和醋都给她买来了。 \n　　俗话说，寡妇门上是非多，不久，村里就风言风语传播说，她准备改嫁了。每当润生的汽车开进村里的时候，孩子们就喊叫说：“看，红梅的‘后老汉’来了！” \n　　郝红梅再一次陷入到苦恼之中。活一回人真难啊！嚼舌头的村民们，我现在这副样子，怎敢妄想嫁给一位司机呢？你们这样瞎说，对我倒没什么，可是叫我的同学怎样再上我的门呢？我而今好不容易碰见一个好心人，你们难道连这么一点帮助都不容我获得吗？ \n　　她不能让她的同学处在这样尴尬的境地中。 \n　　润生再一次来她这里的时候，她对他说：“你以后不要再来了……” \n　　“为什么？”润生问。 \n　　“村里人瞎说哩……” \n　　“你怕吗？” \n　　“我不怕！我已经是这副样子了，还怕什么！我怕你受不了……” \n　　“只要你不怕，我怕什么哩！我和你们村的人一个也不认识，他们愿说啥哩！只要你不在意，我照样来！”红梅扭过头，一边抹眼泪，一边说：“我苦惯了，我不愿再连累别人……” \n　　“不怕！”瘦弱的润生胸脯一挺，倒象个真正的男子汉一样气势雄壮。 \n　　红梅再还有什么话可说呢？对于孤儿寡母来说，没有什么能比得上一个男人的关怀更重要了……但是，话说回来，她能给好心的同学报答什么呢？她一贫如洗，除过每次侍候他吃两碗她精心擀的细面条外，就只能两手空空送人家走了。” \n　　后来，她想起给润生做一双布鞋。尽管她知道人家不缺鞋穿，但这是她的一点心意。农村妇女感谢别\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
