It was a cautioning thought to take into any confrontation with the Spider Queen—should Dortujla succeed.\n“No useful hostages?” Bellonda asked.\nOdrade saw the looks on the faces of her Sisters. They were following a single track as though all of them thought with one mind. Object lessons by Honored Matres, leaving few survivors, only made potential opposition more cautious. It invoked a rule of silence within which bitter memories became bitter myths. Honored Matres were like barbarians in any age: blood instead of hostages. Strike with random viciousness.\n“Dar’s right,” Tamalane said. “We've been seeking allies too close to home.”\n“Futars did not create themselves,” Sheeana said.\n“The ones who created them hope to control us,” Bellonda said. There was the clear sound of Prime Projection\nin her voice. “That’s the hesitation Dortujla heard in the Handlers.”\nThere it was and they faced it with all of its perils. It came down to people (as it always did). People—contemporaries. You learned valuable things from people living in your own time and from knowledge they carried out of their pasts. Other Memory was not the only conveyance of history.\nOdrade felt that she had come home after a long absence. There was a familiarity about the way all four of them were thinking now. It was a familiarity that transcended place. The Sisterhood itself was Home. Not where they lodged in transient housing but the association.\nBellonda voiced it for them. “I fear we have been working at cross purposes.”\n“Fear does that,” Sheeana said.\nOdrade dared not smile. It could be misinterpreted and she did not want to explain. Give us Murbella as a Sister and a restored Bashar! Then we might have our fighting chance!\nRight there with that good feeling in her, the message signal clicked. She glanced at the projection surface, a pure reflex, and recognized crisis. Such a small thing (relatively) to precipitate crisis. Clairby mortally injured in a ’thopter crash. Mortal unless ... The unless was spelled out for her and it added up to cyborg. Her companions saw the message in reverse but you got good at reading mirrored information in here. They knew.\nWhere do we draw the line?\nBellonda, with her antique spectacles when she could have had artificial eyes or any of numerous other prosthetics, voted with her body. This is what it means to be human. Try to hold on to youth and it mocks you while it sprints away. Melange is enough... and perhaps too much.\nOdrade recognized what her own emotions were telling her. But what of Bene Gesserit necessity? Bell could lodge her individual vote and everyone recognized it, even\nrespected it. But Mother Superior’s vote carried the Sisterhood with her.\nFirst the axlotl tanks and now this.\nNecessity said they could not afford to lose specialists of Clairby’s caliber. They had few enough as it was. “Spread thin” did not describe it. Gaps were appearing. Cyborg Clairby, though, and that was the opening wedge.\nThe Suks were prepared. “A precautionary arrangement” should it be required for someone irreplaceable. Such as Mother Superior? Odrade knew she had approved that with her usual cautious reservations. Where were those reservations now?\nCyborg was one of those potpourri words, too. Where did mechanical additions to human flesh become dominant? When was the Cyborg no longer human? Temptations intensified—“Just this one little adjustment.” And so easy to adjust until the potpourri-human became unquestioningly obedient.\nBut... Clairby?\nConditions of extremis said, “Cyborg him!” Was the Sisterhood that desperate? She was forced to answer in the affirmative.\nThere it was then—decision not entirely out of her hands, but the ready excuse at hand. Necessity dictates It.\nThe Butlerian Jihad had left its indelible mark on humans. Fought and won... for then. And here was another battle in that long-ago conflict.\nBut now, survival of the Sisterhood was in the balance. How many technical specialists remained on Chapterhouse? She knew the answer without looking. Not enough.\nOdrade leaned forward and keyed for transmit. “Cyborg him,” she said.\nBellonda grunted. Approval or disapproval? She would never say. This was Mother Superior’s arena and welcome to it!\nWho won this battle? Odrade wondered.\nWe walk a delicate line, perpetuating Atreides (Siona) genes in our population because that hides us from prescience. We carry the Kwisatz Haderach in that bag! Willfulness created Muad’Dib. Prophets make predictions come true! Will we ever again dare ignore our Tao sense and cater to a culture that hates chance and begs for prophecy?\n—ARCHIVAL SUMMARY (ADIXTO)\nt was just after dawn when Odrade arrived at the no-ship but Murbella was up and working with a training mek when Mother Superior strode onto the practice floor.\nOdrade had walked the last klick through ring orchards around the spacefield. Night’s limited clouds had thinned at the approach of dawn, then dissipated to reveal a sky thick with stars.\nShe recognized a delicate weather shift to wrench another crop from this region but decreasing rainfall was barely enough to keep orchards and pastures alive.\nAs she walked, Odrade was overcome by dreariness. Winter just past had been a hard-bought silence between storms. Life was holocaust. Dusting of pollen by eager insects, fruiting and seeding that followed the flower. These orchards were a secret storm whose power lay hidden in torrential flows of life. But ohhh! the destruction. New life carried change. The Changer was coming, always different. Sandworms would bring the desert purity of ancient Dune.\nThe desolation of that transforming power invaded her imagination. She could picture this landscape reduced to windswept dunes, habitat for Leto II’s descendants.\nAnd the arts of Chapterhouse would undergo mutation— one civilization’s myths replaced by another’s.\nThe aura of these thoughts went with Odrade onto the practice floor and colored her mood as she watched Murbella complete a round of flashing exertion, then step back, panting.\nA thin scratch reddened the back of Murbella’s left hand where she had missed a move by the big mek. The automated trainer stood there in the center of the room like a golden pillar, its weapons flicking in and out—probing mandibles of an angry insect.\nMurbella wore tight green leotards and her exposed skin glistened with perspiration. Even with the prominent mounding of her pregnancy, she appeared graceful. Her skin glowed with health. It came from within, Odrade decided, partly the pregnancy but something more fundamental as well. This had impressed itself on Odrade at their first encounter, a thing Lucilla had remarked after capturing Murbella and rescuing Idaho from Gammu. Health lived below the surface in her, there like a lens to focus attention on a deep freshet of vitality.\nWe must have her!\nMurbella saw the visitor but refused to be interrupted.\nNot yet, Mother Superior. My baby is due soon but this body’s needs will continue.\nOdrade saw then that the mek was simulating anger, a programed response brought on by frustration of its circuitry. An extremely dangerous mode!\n“Good morning, Mother Superior.”\nMurbella’s voice came out modulated by her exertions as she dodged and twisted with that almost blinding speed she commanded.\nThe mek slashed and probed for her, its sensors darting and whirring in attempts to follow her movements.\nOdrade sniffed. To speak at such a time amplified the peril of the mek. Risk no distractions when you played this dangerous game. Enough!\nThe mek’s controls were in a large green wall panel to the right of the doorway. Murbella’s changes could be seen in the circuits—dangling wires, beamfields with memory crystals dislocated. Odrade reached up and stilled the mechanism.\nMurbella turned to face her.\n“Why did you change the circuitry?” Odrade demanded.\n“For the anger.”\n“Is that what Honored Matres do?”\n“As the twig is bent?” Murbella massaged her wounded hand. “But what if the twig knows how it is bent and approves?”\nOdrade felt sudden excitement. “Approves? Why?”\n“Because there’s something .. . grand about it.”\n“You follow your adrenaline high?”\n“You know it’s not that!” Murbella’s breathing returned to normal. She stood glaring at Odrade.\n“Then what is it?”\n“It's... being challenged to do more than you ever thought possible. You never suspected you could be this... this good, this expert and accomplished at anything.”\nOdrade concealed elation.\nMens sana in corpore sano. We have her at last!\nOdrade said: “But what a price you pay!”\n“Price?” Murbella sounded astonished. “As long as | have the capacity, I’m delighted to pay.”\n“Take what you want and pay for it?”\n“It’s your Bene Gesserit magic cornucopia: As | become increasingly accomplished, my ability to pay increases.”\n“Beware, Murbella. That cornucopia, as you call it, can become Pandora’s box.”\nMurbella knew the allusion. She stood quite still, her attention fixed on Mother Superior. “Oh?” The sound barely escaped.\n“Pandora’s box releases powerful distractions that waste energies of your life. You speak glibly of being ‘in the chute’\nand becoming a Reverend Mother but you still don’t know what that means nor what we want from you.”\n“Then it was never our sexual abilities you wanted.”\nOdrade moved eight paces forward, majestically deliberate. Once Murbella got on that subject there would be no stopping her short of the usual resolution—argument cut short by Mother Superior’s peremptory command.\n“Sheeana easily mastered your abilities,” Odrade said.\n“So you will use her on that child!”\nOdrade heard displeasure. It was a cultural residue. When did human sexuality begin? Sheeana, waiting now in the no- ship guard chambers, had been forced to deal with it. “/ hope you recognize the source of my reluctance and why I was so secretive, Mother Superior.”\n“I recognize that a Fremen society filled your mind with inhibitions before we took you in hand!”\nThat had cleared the air between them. But how was this exchange with Murbella to be redirected? / must /et it run while | seek a way out.\nThere would be repetition. Unresolved issues would emerge. The fact that almost every word Murbella uttered could be anticipated, that would be a trial.\n“Why do you evade this tested way of dominating others now that you say you need it with Teg?” Murbella asked.\n“Slaves, is that what you want?” Odrade countered.\nEyes almost closed, Murbella considered this. Did / consider the men our slaves? Perhaps. | produced in them periods of wildly unthinking abandon, a giving up to heights of ecstasy they had never dreamed possible. | was trained to give them that and, thereby, make them subject to our control.\nUntil Duncan did the same to me.\nOdrade saw the hooding of Murbella’s eyes and recognized there were things in this woman’s psyche twisted in a way difficult to uncover. Wi/dness running where we have not followed. It was as though Murbella’s original\nclarity had been stained indelibly and then that mark covered over and even this cover masked. There was a harshness in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPIDER QUEEN<|>person<|>A cautionary figure mentioned in the context of confrontation and potential danger, possibly a leader or symbolic entity in the narrative>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORTUJLA<|>person<|>An individual whose success in confrontation with the Spider Queen is considered significant>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>person<|>A Bene Gesserit Sister who participates in strategic discussions and votes on critical decisions>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>person<|>Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, a key decision-maker facing crises and strategic dilemmas>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>person<|>A Bene Gesserit Sister who contributes to discussions about alliances and strategy>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>person<|>A Bene Gesserit member involved in training and strategic discussions, with Fremen cultural influences>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAIRBY<|>person<|>A mortally injured technical specialist whose potential cyborg transformation is debated>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>person<|>A pregnant Honored Matre undergoing Bene Gesserit training, central to their plans>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>organization<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood focused on genetic mastery, political influence, and survival>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>organization<|>A violent faction opposed to the Bene Gesserit, known for brutal tactics>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUKS<|>organization<|>Medical specialists prepared for extreme measures like cyborg transformation>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>geo<|>The Bene Gesserit's home planet, facing ecological and strategic challenges>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>geo<|>A desert planet with historical and mythological significance, referenced as an ecological ideal>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>geo<|>A planet where Murbella was captured and Duncan Idaho was rescued>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>event<|>A historical conflict against thinking machines, influencing current ethical dilemmas>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYBORG TRANSFORMATION<|>event<|>A controversial procedure debated for Clairby, symbolizing ethical and survival trade-offs>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior, leading the Sisterhood through crises<|>9>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Murbella is a pivotal recruit for the Bene Gesserit's survival plans<|>8>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>ODRADE<|>Bellonda respects Odrade's authority but disagrees on ethical decisions like cyborg transformation<|>7>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLAIRBY<|>SUKS<|>The Suks are prepared to perform cyborg transformation on Clairby<|>6>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres are enemies of the Bene Gesserit, employing brutal tactics<|>9>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>DUNE<|>Chapterhouse's ecology is compared to Dune's desert transformation<|>5>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MURBELLA<|>Odrade oversees Murbella's training and sees her as vital to the Sisterhood's future<|>8>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>MURBELLA<|>Sheeana has trained Murbella and addressed her cultural inhibitions<|>6>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Jihad's legacy influences the Sisterhood's aversion to cyborg technology<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
