They would need Duncan Idaho’s new talents to counter the whores. He was no longer merely bait for the destruction of Rakis.\n“He will not be able to leave the no-ship’s concealment, of course,” Teg said.\nShe nodded. Duncan was not shielded from prescient searchers ... such as the Guild navigators.\n“Bashar!” It was the communications officer. “We’ve been bleeped by a satellite!”\n“All right, you ground hogs!” Teg shouted. “Everybody outside! Get Burzmali in here.”\nA hatch at the rear of the station flew open. Burzmali lunged through. “Bashar, what are we—”\n“No time! Take over!” Teg lifted himself from his command chair and waved for Burzmali to take it. “Odrade here will tell you where to go.” On an impulse that he knew was partly vindictive, Teg grasped Odrade’s left arm, leaned close, and kissed her cheek. “Do what you must, daughter,” he whispered. “That worm in the hold may soon be the only one in the universe.”\nOdrade saw it then: Teg knew Taraza’s complete design and intended to carry out his Mother Superior’s orders to the very end.\n“Do what you must.” That said it all.\nWe are not looking at a new state of matter but at a newly recognized relationship between consciousness and matter, which provides a more penetrating insight into the workings of prescience. The oracle shapes a projected inner universe to produce new external probabilities out of forces that are not understood. There is no need to understand these forces before using them to shape the physical universe. Ancient metal workers had no need to understand the molecular and submolecular complexities of their steel, bronze, copper, gold, and tin. They invented mystical powers to describe the unknown while they continued to operate their forges and wield their hammers.\n—MOTHER SUPERIOR TARAZA, ARGUMENT IN COUNCIL\nhe ancient structure in which the Sisterhood secreted its\nChapter House, its Archives, and the offices of its most sacrosanct leadership did not just make sounds in the night. The noises were more like signals. Odrade had learned to read those signals over her many years here. That particular sound there, that strained creaking, was a wooden beam in the floor not replaced in some eight hundred years. It contracted in the night to produce those sounds.\nShe had Taraza’s memories to expand on such signals. The memories were not fully integrated; there had been very little time. Here at night in Taraza’s old working room, Odrade used a few available moments to continue the integration.\nDar and Tar, one at last.\nThat was a quite identifiable Taraza comment.\nTo haunt the Other Memories was to exist on several planes simultaneously, some of them very deep, but Taraza remained near the surface. Odrade allowed herself to sink farther into the multiple existences. Presently, she recognized a self who was currently breathing but remote\nwhile others demanded that she plunge into the all- enfolding visions, everything complete with smells, touches, emotions—all of the originals held intact within her own awareness.\nIt is unsettling to dream another’s dreams.\nTaraza again.\nTaraza who had played such a dangerous game with the future of the entire Sisterhood hanging in the balance! How carefully she had timed the leaking of word to the whores that the Tleilaxu had built dangerous abilities into the ghola. And the attack on the Gammu Keep confirmed that the information had reached its source. The brutal nature of that attack, though, had warned Taraza that she had little time. The whores would be sure to assemble forces for the total destruction of Gammu-—just to kill that one ghola.\nSo much had depended on Teg.\nShe saw the Bashar there in her own assemblage of Other Memories: the father she had never really known.\n| didn’t know him at the end, either.\nIt could be weakening to dig into those memories, but she could not escape the demands of that luring reservoir.\nOdrade thought of the Tyrant’s words: “The terrible field of my past! Answers leap up like a frightened flock blackening the sky of my inescapable memories.”\nOdrade held herself like a swimmer balanced just below the water’s surface.\n| most likely will be replaced, Odrade thought. / may even be reviled. Bellonda certainly was not giving easy agreement to the new state of command. No matter. Survival of the Sisterhood was all that should concern any of them.\nOdrade floated up out of the Other Memories and lifted her gaze to look across the room into the shadowy niche where the bust of a woman could be discerned in the low light of the room’s glowglobes. The bust remained a vague\nShape in its shadows but Odrade knew that face well: Chenoeh, guardian symbol of Chapter House.\n“There but for the grace of God...”\nEvery sister who came through the spice agony (as Chenoeh had not) said or thought that same thing, but what did it really mean? Careful breeding and careful training produced the successful ones in sufficient numbers. Where was the hand of God in that? God certainly was not the worm they had brought from Rakis. Was the presence of God felt only in the successes of the Sisterhood?\nI fall prey to the pretensions of my own Missionaria Protectiva!\nShe knew that these were similar to thoughts and questions that had been heard in this room on countless occasions. Bootless! Still, she could not bring herself to remove that guardian bust from the niche where it had reposed for so long.\nl am not superstitious, she told herself. / am not a compulsive person. This is a matter of tradition. Such things have a value well known to us.\nCertainly, no bust of me will ever be so honored.\nShe thought of Waff and his Face Dancers dead with Miles Teg in the terrible destruction of Rakis. It did not do to dwell on the bloody attrition being suffered in the Old Empire. Better to think about the muscles of retribution being created by the blundering violence of the Honored Matres.\nTeg knew!\nThe recently concluded Council session had subsided in fatigue without firm conclusions. Odrade counted herself lucky to have diverted attention into a few immediate concerns dear to them all.\nThe punishments: Those had occupied them for a time. Historical precedents fleshed out the Archival analyses to a satisfying form. Those assemblages of humans who allied themselves with the Honored Matres were in for some shocks.\nIx would certainly overextend itself. They had not the Slightest appreciation of how competition from the Scattering would crush them.\nThe Guild would be shunted aside and made to pay dearly for its melange and its machinery. Guild and Ix, thrown together, would fall together.\nThe Fish Speakers could be mostly ignored. Satellites of Ix, they were already fading into a past that humans would abandon.\nAnd the Bene Tleilax. Ah, yes, the Tleilaxu. Waff had succumbed to the Honored Matres. He had never admitted it but the truth was plain. “Just once and with one of my own Face Dancers.”\nOdrade smiled grimly, remembering her father’s bitter kiss.\n| will have another niche made, she thought. / will commission another bust: Miles Teg, the Great Heretic!\nLucilla’s suspicions about Teg were disquieting, though. Had he been prescient at last and able to see the no-ships? Well, the Breeding Mistresses could explore those SUSPICIONS.\n“We have laagered up!” Bellonda accused.\nThey all knew the meaning of that word: they had retreated into a fortress position for the long night of the whores.\nOdrade realized she did not much care for Bellonda, the way she laughed occasionally to expose those wide, blunt teeth.\nThey had discussed the cell samples from Sheeana for a long time. The “proof of Siona” was there. She had the ancestry that shielded her from prescience and could leave the no-ship.\nDuncan was an unknown.\nOdrade turned her thoughts to the ghola out there in the grounded no-ship. Lifting herself from the chair, she crossed\nto the dark window and looked in the direction of the distant landing field.\nDid they dare risk releasing Duncan from the shielding of that ship? The cell studies said he was a mixture of many Idaho gholas—some descendant of Siona. But what of the taint from the original?\nNo. He must remain confined.\nAnd what of Murbella?—pregnant Murbella? An Honored Matre dishonored.\n“The Tleilaxu intended for me to kill the Imprinter,” Duncan said.\n“Will you try to kill the whore?” That was Lucilla’s question.\n“She is not an Imprinter,” Duncan said.\nThe Council had discussed at length the possible nature of the bonding between Duncan and Murbella. Lucilla maintained there was no bonding at all, that the two remained wary opponents.\n“Best not to risk putting them together.”\nThe sexual prowess of the whores would have to be studied at length, though. Perhaps a meeting between Duncan and Murbella in the no-ship could be risked. With careful protective measures, of course.\nLastly, she thought about the worm in the no-ship’s hold —a worm nearing the moment of its metamorphosis. A Small earth-dammed basin filled with melange awaited that worm. When the moment came, it would be lured out by Sheeana into the bath of melange and water. The resulting sandtrout could then begin their long transformation.\nYou were right, father. It was so simple when you looked at it clearly.\nNo need to seek a desert planet for the worms. The sandtrout would create their own habitat for Shai-hulud. It was not pleasant to think of Chapter House Planet transformed into vast areas of wasteland but it had to be done.\nThe “Last Will and Testament of Miles Teg,” which he had planted in the no-ship’s submolecular storage systems, could not be discredited. Even Bellonda agreed to that.\nChapter House required a complete revision of all its historical records. A new look had been demanded of them by what Teg had seen of the Lost Ones—the whores from the Scattering.\n“You seldom learn the names of the truly wealthy and powerful. You see only their sookesmen. The political arena makes a few exceptions to this but does not reveal the full power structure.”\nThe Mentat philosopher had chewed deep into everything they accepted and what he disgorged did not agree with Archival dependence upon “our inviolate summations.”\nWe knew it, Miles, we just never faced up to it. We're all going to be digging in our Other Memories for the next few generations.\nFixed data storage systems could not be trusted.\n“If you destroy most copies, time will take care of the rest.”\nHow Archives had raged at that telling pronouncement by the Bashar!\n“The writing of history is largely a process of diversion. Most historical accounts divert attention from the secret influences around the recorded events.”\nThat was the one that had brought down Bellonda. She had taken it up on her own, admitting: “The few histories that escape this restrictive process vanish into obscurity through obvious processes.”\nTeg had listed some of the processes: “Destruction of as many copies as possible, burying the too revealing accounts in ridicule, ignoring them in the centers of education, insuring that they are not quoted elsewhere and, in some cases, elimination of the authors.”\nNot to mention the scapegoat process that brought death to more than one messenger bearing unwelcome news,\nOdrade thought. She recalled an ancient ruler who kept a pikestaff handy\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3b0032db4dcde36a87c493902dfea511518b6c1574f89db3e09c79649f2a2ca6_v2"}
