While he initiates and leads the conflict, he simultaneously fears its devastating outcomes, foreseeing the bloodshed carried out in his name by fanatic legions, particularly the Fremen. The Jihad becomes an inescapable force in Paul's life, shaping his destiny and the fate of his empire.  \n\nDespite his leadership role, Paul is deeply conflicted, seeking to avoid or end the Jihad due to its destructive nature. He feels trapped by its consequences, struggling with the weight of the violence unleashed under his banner. The Jihad is compared to the Typhoon Struggle, emphasizing its catastrophic scale.  \n\nUltimately, Paul foresees the Jihad as both an inevitable and horrifying event, one that he cannot fully control despite his efforts. His relationship with the Jihad is marked by a dualityâ€”he is its figurehead yet its reluctant architect, driven by destiny but tormented by its repercussions.
