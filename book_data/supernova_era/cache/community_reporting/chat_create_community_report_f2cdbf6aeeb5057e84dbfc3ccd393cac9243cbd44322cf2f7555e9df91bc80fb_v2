It is the date when 富坚慎二 is presumed to have been murdered, marking a pivotal moment in the narrative surrounding the case. The investigation reveals that this date is not only associated with the murder but also with various key events and alibis related to the individuals involved.\n\nOn March 10, 石神 was notably absent from school, which raises questions about his whereabouts and potential involvement in the events of that night. This absence is critical as it aligns with the timeline of 富坚慎二's murder, making it a focal point for investigators. Additionally, the date is linked to 花冈靖子 (Yasuko Hanaoka), whose alibi is scrutinized in relation to the murder case, further complicating the narrative.\n\nThe significance of March 10 extends beyond the murder itself; it is also the date when 富坚慎二 was first encountered by 石神, establishing a connection between the two individuals that is essential to understanding the dynamics of the case. Furthermore, it is noted that this date coincides with the disappearance of another man, adding another layer of complexity to the investigation.\n\nMoreover, March 10 is marked by other events, such as the theft of a bicycle, which may or may not be related to the central murder investigation but highlights the day's chaotic nature. The various descriptions emphasize that March 10 is a crucial date that encapsulates the intertwining fates of the characters involved and the unfolding mystery surrounding 富坚慎二's death.\n\nIn summary, March 10 serves as a critical juncture in the investigation, linking the actions and alibis of 石神 and 花冈靖子 to the murder of 富坚慎二.
