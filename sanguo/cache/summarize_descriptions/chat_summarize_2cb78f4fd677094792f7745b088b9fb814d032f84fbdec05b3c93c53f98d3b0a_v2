This group was notorious for their involvement in court intrigues and corrupt practices, which significantly impacted the political landscape of the time. They were implicated in various conspiracies, including plots against prominent figures such as 何进, showcasing their willingness to manipulate political affairs for their own gain.\n\nThe Ten Attendants held a unique position in the Han court, where they not only influenced decisions but also engaged in the sale of official positions, contributing to widespread social unrest. Their actions often led to chaos and conflict surrounding the emperor, as they prioritized their interests over the stability of the state. This manipulation of power and involvement in corrupt practices marked them as key players in the political turmoil of the era.\n\nOverall, the Ten Attendants were emblematic of the challenges faced by the Han dynasty, as their significant power and influence in the court ultimately played a role in the decline of the dynasty itself.
