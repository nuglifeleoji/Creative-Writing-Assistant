He is depicted as a troubled individual who has been involved in a tumultuous relationship with 靖子, marked by his resistance to divorce and persistent attempts to reconcile with her. Despite their separation, 富坚 continues to pursue 靖子, which has led to perceptions of him having ulterior motives, possibly related to financial matters.\n\n富坚's situation escalates dramatically when he becomes embroiled in a negotiation that goes awry, resulting in his death. His body is discovered on a tatami mat, prompting a police investigation that reveals his past actions and their implications for 靖子 and another character, 美里. The investigation highlights 富坚's connections to both women, as well as his history of dental treatment, which is scrutinized during the inquiry.\n\nHis death serves as a catalyst for 石神, who devises a plan to distance the case from 靖子 and 美里, indicating that 富坚's demise has significant repercussions for those left behind. The narrative suggests that 富坚 exhibited violent tendencies, having attempted to attack 美里 and posed a threat to 靖子, which adds layers to his character and the circumstances surrounding his death.\n\n富坚 is portrayed as a victim in a murder case, with his past actions and relationships being central to the unfolding drama. His connection to 靖子 is particularly poignant, as it reveals the emotional turmoil and legal complications that arise from their shared history.
