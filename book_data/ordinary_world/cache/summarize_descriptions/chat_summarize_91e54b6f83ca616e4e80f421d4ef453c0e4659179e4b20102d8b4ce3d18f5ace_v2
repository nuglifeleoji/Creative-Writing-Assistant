He is a villager who has recently received commendation for his son, Jin Erchui, who is set to join the People's Liberation Army, generating excitement within the village. As a former landlord's son, Jin Guangliang has experienced a shift in social dynamics due to new policies, which has contributed to his somewhat arrogant demeanor.\n\nJin Guangliang is deeply invested in beekeeping, raising Italian bees that he sells in the local market.
