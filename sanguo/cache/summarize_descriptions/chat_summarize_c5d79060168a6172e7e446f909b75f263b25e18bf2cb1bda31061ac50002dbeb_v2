He is primarily recognized for his military leadership, commanding an army of twenty thousand soldiers tasked with defending the sword pass against invading forces. This strategic position is critical, as it serves as a key defensive point against the incursions of the Wei army.\n\nIn addition to his military responsibilities, 董厥 also serves as a historian under the chancellorship, indicating his involvement in the documentation and analysis of historical events, which may inform his military strategies and decisions. His dual role highlights the importance of historical knowledge in military leadership, as understanding past conflicts can provide valuable insights for current challenges.\n\n董厥's military preparations are notably influenced by his instructions from 姜维, another prominent military leader of the time.
