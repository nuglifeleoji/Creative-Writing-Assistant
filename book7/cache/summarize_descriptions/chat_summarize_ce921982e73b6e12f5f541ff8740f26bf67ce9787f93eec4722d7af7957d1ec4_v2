It is noted that 草S intends to visit 帝都大学 for further investigation, indicating its importance in the context of the story. The university is also the alma mater of the character 石神, who is an alumnus, and it is currently attended by 美里, who is studying there.\n\nAdditionally, 帝都大学 serves as the setting for interactions among several characters, including 汤川 and 草S, who are located in the physics department's research room. This suggests that the university has a strong emphasis on scientific research and collaboration among its students and faculty. The presence of Professor Takagawa, who is affiliated with the university, further highlights the academic environment of 帝都大学.\n\nThe institution is also connected to a letter found by 石神, which suggests that it may hold clues or information pertinent to the ongoing investigation. This connection emphasizes the university's role not only as an educational facility but also as a pivotal location for the unfolding events in the narrative.\n\nIn summary, 帝都大学 is depicted as a significant higher education institution where key characters such as 石神, 美里, and 汤川 are linked through their academic pursuits and investigations.
