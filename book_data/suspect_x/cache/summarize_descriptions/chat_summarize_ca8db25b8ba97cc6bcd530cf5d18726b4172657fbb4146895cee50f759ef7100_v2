She plays a pivotal role as a key conspirator within the order and is notably recognized for administering the gom jabbar test to **Paul Atreides**, determining his humanity and potential. As the Bene Gesserit Proctor, Mohiam is a significant figure, deeply involved in the order's political and genetic machinations.  \n\nHer relationship with Paul is fraught with tension; she is both his tester and an object of his hatred. After Paul's rise to power, he orders her removal from the heighliner, underscoring their contentious dynamic. Despite her authoritative position, Mohiam's presence becomes a point of conflict, reflecting the broader struggle between the Bene Gesserit and Paul's ascendant influence.  \n\nMohiam's actions and legacy are inextricably tied to Paul's journey, marking her as a formidable yet polarizing figure in the Bene Gesserit's schemes.
