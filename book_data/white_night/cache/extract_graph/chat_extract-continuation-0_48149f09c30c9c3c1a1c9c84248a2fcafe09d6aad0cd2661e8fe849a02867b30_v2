今天心情很好。精神力突破两百点，而且他可以肯定，是因为精神力测试，才让自己一下突破了的。到了灵通境中阶，他自己都觉得自己的精神层面似乎有了明显的提升。\n\n    修炼了几个月，他也自问有了不小的进步，魂力提升虽慢，但身体素质以及综合实力，他自认还是有不小的提高。实战也正好检验一下。他和刘锋、钱磊之间的配合，这三个月来也变得更加默契了。和期中考试时相比，足以算是质变。\n\n    “好，稍后抽签。进入模拟舱。”\n\n    实战考核自然还是在模拟舱之中进行的，以避免不必要的伤亡，也可以让学员们最大程度的发挥出自身实力。\n\n    进入模拟舱，刚刚登陆，蓝轩宇、钱磊、刘锋三人就被传送到了一座擂台之上。\n\n    擂台是圆形的，直径大约有三十米左右。相当的宽阔。他们都才只是一两环的修为，足够施展了。\n\n    “我上来召唤不召唤？”钱磊看向蓝轩宇问道。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“以你现在的精神力，按照这种车轮战，每次能够在外面恢复魂力的情况下，能够召唤几次？”\n\n    钱磊道：“要看召唤对象的实力。这对我的消耗是不一样的。如果是冻千秋的话，五次应该可以。但是，那姑娘的脾气似乎不太好啊！她肯来那么多次吗？”\n\n    这是个问题……\n\n    因为多次召唤，大家也勉强算是熟悉了，知道冻千秋是来自于天斗星的一名学员，年龄比他们大一岁。也是娜娜的学生。\n\n    可这姑娘性格有些清冷，之前他们召唤次数多一些的时候，她经常会不出现。譬如上次期中考试，她就没有第一时间出来。\n\n    这考核要是连续召唤她五次，她能每次都来？这可不好说啊！\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“换手召唤呢？”\n\n    钱磊眼睛一亮，“三次应该勉强能支撑。也就是说，我们至少有三场是一定能赢的。再加上起码可以召唤冻千秋一次吧，这样四场就稳了。我现在就希望，在前面几场能碰上吕千寻他们，先把最强的击败。后面的就靠你俩了。”\n\n    蓝轩宇不只是有左手的银纹蓝银草，当他用右手的金纹蓝银草辅助召唤之门时，召唤的情况，是不一样的，是为：换手召唤。\n\n    “兵来将挡水来土掩吧！”刘锋眼中闪烁着强烈的战意。\n\n    蓝轩宇双眼微眯，点了点头，“那就这样，前面三场到四场，我们以钱磊的召唤为主，咱们俩尽量节省精力。后面的，咱们努力。钱磊休息，争取在最后一两场的时候，能够再召唤一次。”\n\n    “好，就这么定了。”钱磊用力的挥动了一下手臂。先消耗、先恢复，他率先施展召唤之门\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
