\n　　“不！不！这是为什么？为什么！为什么……”顾养民瞪着惊恐的眼睛，绝望地喊叫着。他一下子倒在她旁边的地上，两只手疯狂地抓着黄土，哭起来了。 \n　　红梅象死人一样呆坐着。她不再对顾养民解释这件事的前前后后。反正一切都完了；她感到天空和大地一起在她眼前旋转。 \n　　过了片刻，满脸糊着泥土和泪痕的顾养民爬起来，悲愤地转过身，默默无语地沿着弯弯的山路走了——永远地走了。空旷的山野里，在那死一般的寂寥之中，只有一支深情而忧伤的信天游在高原上飘荡——三十里明沙呀四十里水，五十里路上看妹妹。 \n　　牵牛牛开花羊跑青，那时候见罢到如今。 \n　　大红公鸡毛腿腿，不想妹妹再想谁。 \n　　木鸽子喝了消冰水，往日里喜来今日里灰！ \n　　花椒树上落雀雀，一对对成了单爪爪。 \n　　井子里打水麻绳绳短，你丢下妹妹谁照管？ \n　　城墙底下撒豌豆，你扔下妹妹谁收留？ \n　　一只孤雁当天叫，我心里的苦情谁知道……从此以后，她就堕入了一片黑暗之中。过去的一切都成了一场梦。她不抱怨任何人，只抱怨她自己。她亲手把自己的青春年华毁灭了。 \n　　同年夏天，她听说顾养民考进了省医学院。这消息既不使她高兴，也不使她痛苦。那个人的好好坏坏已经与她无干；至于他那光辉的前程，她早就估计到了。 \n　　第二年春天，本队干部的几个子女都从高中毕业回了村，她的教师职位也自然被挤掉了。她并不为此而过分地难受；她的暗淡命运也早就注定了。这时候，外县一个亲戚给她介绍了当地一位农村小学教员。她二话没说就答应了这门亲事。她挎着一个土布包袱，单身一人来到这个陌生的地方，很快就结婚了…… \n　　她对自己的婚姻很满足。丈夫是个公派教师，人很老实，爱她，体贴她。公公和婆婆跟她丈夫的弟弟一块过；他们小两口单家独户，光景日月倒也很安乐。再说，这地方已经到了外县，她对这一点也很满意——她要远离她的痛苦与耻辱之地。 \n　　不久，她怀孕了。她摸着自己不断膨胀起来的肚子，重新体验到了人生的幸福；往日的不幸渐渐变得遥远而模糊了。 \n　　但是，灾难再一次从天而降。她的孩子刚满月，男人就死了。可怜的丈夫攒了一点钱，想重新整治一院地方，便雇了几个人\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>顾养民<|>PERSON<|>顾养民 is a character who
