Nothing stops until dead and perhaps not even then, because each life creates endless ripples. Induction bounces within and you sensitize yourself to it. Deduction conveys illusions of absolutes. Kick the truth and shatter it!”\nWhen Bellonda’s questions touched on the relationship between himself and Murbella, he saw vague emotional responses. Amusement? Jealousy? He could accept amusement (and even jealousy) about the compelling\nsexual demands of this mutual addiction. /s the ecstasy truly that great?\nHe wandered through his quarters this afternoon feeling displaced, as though newly here and not yet accepting these rooms as home. That is emotion talking to me.\nOver the years of his confinement, these quarters had taken on a lived-in appearance. This was his cave, the former supercargo suite: large rooms with slightly curved walls—bedroom, library-workroom, sitting room, a green- tiled bath with dry and wet cleansing systems, and a long practice hall he shared with Murbella for exercise.\nThe rooms bore a unique collection of artifacts and marks of his presence: that slingchair placed at just the right angle to the console and projector linking him to Shipsystems, those ridulian records on that low side table. And there were stains of occupancy—that dark brown blot on the worktable. Spilled food had left its indelible mark.\nHe moved restlessly into his sleeping quarters. The light was dimmer. His ability to identify the familiar held true for odors. There was a Saliva-like smell to the bed—the residue of last night’s sexual collision.\nThat is the proper word: collision.\nThe no-ship’s air—filtered, recycled, and sweetened— often bored him. No break in the no-ship maze to the exterior world ever remained open long. He sometimes sat Silently sniffing, hoping for a faint trace of air that had not been adjusted to the prison’s demands.\nThere is a way to escape!\nHe wandered out of his quarters and down the corridor, took the dropchute at the end of the passage and emerged in the ship’s lowest level.\nWhat is really happening out there in that world open to the sky?\nThe bits Odrade told him about events filled him with dread and a trapped feeling. No place to run! Am I wise to share my fears with Sheeana? Murbella merely laughed. “I\nwill protect you, love. Honored Matres won’t hurt me.” Another false dream.\nBut Sheeana... how quickly she had picked up the hand- language and entered the spirit of his conspiracy. Conspiracy? No...1!doubt that any Reverend Mother will act against her Sisters. Even the Lady Jessica went back to them in the end. But | don’t ask Sheeana to act against the Sisterhood, only that she protect us from Murbella’s folly.\nThe enormous powers of the hunters made only the destruction predictable. A Mentat had but to look at their disruptive violence. They brought something else as well, something hinting at matters out there in the Scattering. What were these Futars Odrade mentioned with such casualness? Part human, part beast? That had been Lucilla’s guess. And where is Lucilla?\nHe found himself presently in the Great Hold, the kilometer-long cargo space where they had carried the last giant sandworm of Dune, bringing it to Chapterhouse. The area still smelled of spice and sand, filling his mind with long-ago and the dead far away. He knew why he came so often to the Great Hold, doing it sometimes without even thinking, as he had just done. It both attracted and repelled. The illusion of unlimited space with traces of dust, sand, and spice carried the nostalgia of lost freedoms. But there was another side. This is where it always happened to him.\nWill it happen today?\nWithout warning, the sense of being in the Great Hold would vanish. Then... the net shimmering in a molten sky. He was aware when the vision came that he was not really seeing a net. His mind translated what the senses could not define.\nA shimmering net undulating like an infinite borealis.\nThen the net would part and he would see two people— man and woman. How ordinary they appeared and yet extraordinary. A grandmother and grandfather in antique clothing: bib coveralls for the man and a long dress with\nheadscarf for the woman. Working in a flower garden! He thought it must be more of the illusion. / am seeing this but it is not really what I see.\nThey always noticed him eventually. He heard their voices. “There he is again, Marty,” the man would say, calling the woman’s attention to Idaho.\n“I wonder how it is he can look through?” Marty asked once. “Doesn’t seem possible.”\n“He’s spread pretty thin, | think. Wonder if he knows the danger?”\nDanger. That was the word that always jerked him out of the vision.\n“Not at your console today?”\nFor just an instant, Idaho thought it was the vision, the voice of that odd woman, then he realized it was Odrade. Her voice came from close behind. He whirled and saw he had failed to close the hatch. She had followed him into the Hold, stalking him quietly, avoiding the scattered patches of sand that might have grated underfoot and betrayed her approach.\nShe looked tired and impatient. Why did she think | would be at my console?\nAs though answering his unspoken question, she said: “l find you at your console so often lately. For what do you search, Duncan?”\nHe shook his head without speaking. Why do I suddenly feel in peril?\nIt was a rare feeling in Odrade’s company. He could remember other occasions, though. Once when she had stared suspiciously at his hands in the field of his console. Fear associated with my console. Do I reveal my Mentat hunger for data? Do they guess that I have hidden my private self there?\n“Do | get no privacy at all?” Anger and attack.\nShe shook her head slowly from side to side as much to say, “You can do better than that.”\n“This is your second visit today,” he accused.\n“I must say you’re looking well, Duncan.” More circumlocution.\n“Is that what your watchers say?”\n“Don’t be petty. | came for a chat with Murbella. She said you'd be down here.”\n“I Suppose you know Murbella’s pregnant again.” Was that trying to placate her?\n“For which we are grateful. | came to tell you that Sheeana wants to visit you again.”\nWhy would Odrade announce that?\nHer words filled him with images of the Dune waif who had become a full Reverend Mother (the youngest ever, so they said). Sheeana, his confidante, out there watching over that last great sandworm. Had it finally perpetuated itself? Why should Odrade interest herself in Sheeana’s visit?\n“Sheeana wants to discuss the Tyrant with you.”\nShe saw the surprise this produced.\n“What could | possibly add to Sheeana’s knowledge of Leto II?” he demanded. “She’s a Reverend Mother.”\n“You knew the Atreides intimately.”\nAhhhhh. She’s hunting for the Mentat.\n“But you said she wanted to discuss Leto and it’s not safe to think of him as Atreides.”\n“Oh, but he was. Refined into something more elemental than anyone before him, but one of us, nonetheless.”\nOne of us! She reminded him that she, too, was Atreides. Calling in his never-ending debt to the family!\n“So you Say.”\n“Shouldn’t we stop playing this foolish game?”\nCaution gripped him. He knew she saw it. Reverend Mothers were so damnably sensitive. He stared at her, not daring to speak, knowing even this told her too much.\n“We believe you remember more than one ghola lifetime.” And when he still did not respond, “Come, come, Duncan! Are you a Mentat?”\nThe way she spoke, as much accusation as question, he knew concealment had ended. It was almost a relief.\n“And if | am?”\n“The Tleilaxu mixed the cells from more than one Idaho ghola when they grew you.”\nIdaho-ghola! He refused to think of himself in that abstraction. “Why is Leto suddenly so important to you?” No escaping the admission in that reponse.\n“Our worm has become sandtrout.”\n“Are they growing and propagating?”\n“Apparently.”\n“Unless you contain them or eliminate them, Chapterhouse may become another Dune.”\n“You figured that out, did you?”\n“Leto and | together.”\n“So you remember many lives. Fascinating. It makes you somewhat like us.” How unswerving her stare!\n“Very different, | think.” Have to get her off that track!\n“You acquired the memories during your first encounter with Murbella?”\nWho guessed it? Lucilla? She was there and might have guessed, confiding her suspicions to her Sisters. He had to bring the deadly issue into the open. “I’m not another Kwisatz Haderach!”\n“You're not?” Studied objectivity. She allowed this to reveal itself, a cruelty, he thought.\n“You know I’m not!” He was fighting for his life and knew it. Not so much with Odrade as with those others who watched and reviewed the comeye records.\n“Tell me about your serial memories.” That was a command from the Mother Superior. No escaping it.\n“I know those... lives. It’s like one lifetime.”\n“That accumulation could be very valuable to us, Duncan. Do you also remember the axlotl tanks?”\nHer question sent his thoughts into the misty probings that caused him to imagine strange things about the\nTleilaxu—great mounds of human flesh softly visible to the imperfect newborn eyes, blurred and unfocused images, almost-memories of emerging from birth canals. How could that accord with tanks?\n“Scytale has provided us with the knowledge to make our own axlotl system,” Odrade said.\nSystem? Interesting word. “Does that mean you also duplicate Tleilaxu spice production?”\n“Scytale bargains for more than we will give. But spice will come in time, one way or another.”\nOdrade heard herself speak firmly and wondered if he detected uncertainty. We might not have the time to do it.\n“The Sisters you Scatter are hobbled,” he said, giving her a small taste of Mentat awareness. “You’re drawing on your spice stockpiles to supply them and those must be finite.”\n“They have our axlotl knowledge and sandtrout.”\nHe was shocked to silence by the possibility of countless Dunes being reproduced in an infinite universe.\n“They will solve the problem of melange supply with tanks or worms or both,” she said. This she could say sincerely. It came from statistical expectation. One among those Scattered bands of Reverend Mothers should accomplish it.\n“The tanks,” he said. “I have strange... dreams.” He had almost said “musings.”\n“And well you should.” Briefly, she told him how female flesh was incorporated.\n“For making the spice, too?”\n“We think so.”\n“Disgusting!”\n“That’s juvenile,” she chided.\nIn such moments, he disliked her intensely. Once, he had reproached her for the way Reverend Mothers removed themselves from “the common stream of human emotions,” and she had given him that identical answer.\nJuvenile!\n“For which there probably is no remedy,” he said. “A disgraceful flaw in my character.”\n“Were you thinking to debate morality with me?”\nHe thought he heard anger. “Not even ethics. We work by different rules.”\n“Rules are often an excuse to ignore compassion.”\n“Do | hear a faint echo of conscience in a Reverend Mother?”\n“Deplorable.
