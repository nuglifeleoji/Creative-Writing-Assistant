"completion_tokens": 0}}, "input": {"input": [" the old\ntongue, the phrase translated as “Kwisatz Haderach.” The planetologist’s odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.\nKwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: “Many people have sought to change Arrakis.”\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served, my Lord.”\nThe Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.\n“The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,” she said, and smiled: “Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?”\nHe spoke coldly: “That seems a goodly custom. We Shall let it stand for now.”\nThe illusion that | suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?\nJessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. /s it\nbecause | moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.\nLeto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: “Sire! | forbid it!”\nA grim smile touched the Duke’s mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head. “I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,” he’d said. “Things move too swiftly on Arrakis. That’s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.”\nPaul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.\n“Her father manufactures stillsuits,” Jessica said. “I'm told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man’s suits.”\n“Who’s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?” the Duke asked. “I don’t place him.”\n“A late addition to the list,” she whispered. “Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.”\n“Gurney arranged?”\n“At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler’s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He’s a\npower among his kind. They all know him here. He’s dined at many of the houses.”\n“Why is he here?”\n“Everyone here will ask that question,” she said. “Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He'll also serve notice that you’re prepared to back up your orders against graft—by enforcement from the smugglers’ end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.”\n“l'm not sure / like it.” He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. “Why didn’t you invite some Fremen?”\n“There’s Kynes,” she said.\n“Yes, there’s Kynes,” he said. “Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?” He led her into step behind the procession.\n“All else is most conventional,” she said.\nAnd she thought: My darling, can’t you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.\nAs they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.\nUneasy silence settled over the room.\nJessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto’s mouth,\nnoted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.\n“Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,” Leto said. “This is my way of telling you that many things will change.”\nEmbarrassed silence settled over the table.\nThey think him drunk, Jessica thought.\nLeto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot beams of reflection off it. “As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,” he said, “I give you a toast.”\nThe others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a Ssuspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke’s hawk features.\n“Here I am and here | remain!” he barked.\nThere was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths—stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. “My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: ‘Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!’”\nHe sipped his water.\nThe others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.\n“Gurney!” the Duke called.\nFrom an alcove at Leto’s end of the room came Halleck’s voice. “Here, my Lord.”\n“Give us a tune, Gurney.”\nA minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the\ntable at the Duke’s gesture releasing them—roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-ole served with sparkling Caladan wine.\nStill, the Duke remained standing.\nAs the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: “In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.” His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. “I cannot sing, but | give you the words of Gurney’s song. Consider it another toast—a toast to all who’ve died bringing us to this station.”\nAn uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.\nJessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her—there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle- faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuek, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.\n“Review, friends—troops long past review,” the Duke intoned. “All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review, friends—troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends—troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we’ll pass the lure of fortune.”\nThe Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, Slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen.\nThe others drank in embarrassed silence.\nAgain, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.\nJessica was first to follow his example.\nThere was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests’ actions revealed—especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions, nervous laughter...and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.\nKynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetologist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.\nHalleck’s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.\n“Let the dinner commence,” the Duke said, and sank into his chair.\nHe’s angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.\nSlowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way. The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.\n“We brought both from Caladan,” she said. “Superb!” he said, tasting the chukka. “Simply superb! And not a hint of melange in it. One gets so\ntired of the spice in everything.”\nThe Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. “I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.”\n“News travels fast,” the Duke said.\n“Then it’s true?” the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.\n“Of course, it’s true!” the Duke snapped. “The blasted carryall disappeared. It shouldn’t be possible for anything that big to disappear!”\n“When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,” Kynes said.\n“It should not be possible!” the Duke repeated.\n“No one saw the carryall leave?” the banker asked.\n“Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,” Kynes said. “They’re primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall’s complement usually is four\nmen—two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one—or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke’s foes—”\n“Ah-h-h, | see,” the banker said. “And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?”\n“I shall have to consider my position carefully,” Kynes said, “and | certainly will not discuss it at table.” And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this ts the kind of infraction | was instructed to ignore.\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy- faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern", " one—or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke’s foes—”\n“Ah-h-h, | see,” the banker said. “And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?”\n“I shall have to consider my position carefully,” Kynes said, “and | certainly will not discuss it at table.” And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man!

Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.\nNow, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents. That Is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to separate this element for your analysis—in the beginning, through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by close observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You will find it\nfairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.\nNow, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern—subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.\nDoes this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself. /t’s his pattern.\nThe banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.\n“I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,” the banker said, directing his words at Jessica. “All of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers.”\nThe stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, seated between Paul and his father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: “Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.”\nThe banker smiled. “They call me Soo-Soo because I’m financial adviser to the Water Peddlers Union.” And, as Jessica continued to look at him without comment, he added: “Because of the water- sellers’ cry—‘Soo-Soo Sook!’” And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.\nJessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cue—a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had said: “/, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis—water.”\nPaul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion’s voice, saw that his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the banker.\n“Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?”\n“That’s an odd question, young Master,” the banker said. “I merely said the birds drink blood. It doesn’t have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?”\n“It was not an odd question,” Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. “Most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind.” He deliberately forked a bite of food from his\ncompanion’s plate, ate it. “They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.”\nThe banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.\n“Do not make the error of considering my son a child,” the Duke said. And he smiled.\nJessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.\n“It’s a rule of ecology,” Kynes said, “that the young Master appears to understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood’s an efficient energy source.”\nThe banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: “It’s said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.”\nKynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: “Not the blood, sir. But all of a man’s water, ultimately, belongs to his people—to his tribe. It’s a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water’s precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.”\nThe banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.\nKynes looked at Jessica. “Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying.”\n“You’ve associated so long with Fremen that you've lost all sensibilities,” the banker rasped.\nKynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. “Are you challenging me, sir?”\nThe banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: “Of course not. I’d not so insult our host and hostess.”\nJessica heard the fear in the man’s voice, saw it in his face, in his breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!\n“Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when they’ve been insulted, Kynes said. “They’re brave people who understand defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here...now...on Arrakis.”\nJessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker’s discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.\n“Well?” Kynes said.\n“I meant no offense,” the banker muttered. “If offense was taken, please accept my apologies.”\n“Freely given, freely accepted,” Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.\nJessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes’ assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.\nLeto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The ecologist’s manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.\nJessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared with /angues de lapins de garenne—red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side.\nSlowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would have killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes’ manner. He was a casual killer, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.\nJessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: “I find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.”\n“Very important,” he agreed. “What is this dish? It’s delicious.”\n“Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,” she said. “A very old recipe.”\n“I must have that recipe,” the man said.\nShe nodded. “I'll see that you get it.”\nKynes looked at Jessica, said: “The newcomer to Arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum.”\nShe heard the testing quality in his voice, said, “Growth is limited by that necessity which is present\nin the least amount. And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.”\n“It’s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems,” Kynes said. “Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care.”\nJessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes’ words, but knew she was missing it. “Growth,” she said. “Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?”\n“Impossible!” the water magnate barked.\nJessica turned her attention to Bewt. “Impossible?”\n“Impossible on Arrakis,” he said. “Don’t listen to this dreamer. All the laboratory evidence is against him.”\nKynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.\n“Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,” Kynes said. “That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.”\n“Normal!” Bewt snorted. “Nothing about Arrakis is normal!”\n“Quite the contrary,” Kynes said. “Certain harmonies could be set up here along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it.”\n“It'll never be done,” Bewt said.\nThe Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes’ attitude had changed—it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.\n“What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?” Leto asked.\n“If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we’ve started the cyclic system,” Kynes said.\n“Water’s the only problem?” the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes’ excitement, felt himself caught up in it.\n“Water overshadows the other problems,” Kynes said. “This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants—widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.”\n“Do you have pilot projects?” the Duke asked. “We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect—small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its\nworking facts,” Kynes said.\n“There isn’t enough water,” Bewt said. “There just isn’t enough water.”\n“Master Bewt is an expert on water,” Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! | want an answer! Is there", ".\n“Water’s the only problem?” the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes’ excitement, felt himself caught up in it.\n“Water overshadows the other problems,” Kynes said. “This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants—widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes.

He smiled, turned back to his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! | want an answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?”\nKynes stared at his plate.\nJessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.\n“Is there enough water!” the Duke demanded.\n“There...may be,” Kynes said.\nHe’s faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.\nWith his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But Kynes doesn’t wish it to be known.\n“Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,” Bewt said. “He dreams with the Fremen—of prophecies and messiahs.”\nChuckles sounded at odd places around the table. Jessica marked them—the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.\nTensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There’s too much going on of which I’m not aware. l'Il have to develop new information sources.\nThe Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let down, as though something vital had passed him here. “Maybe,” he muttered.\nKynes spoke quickly: “Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord. There are so many—”\nThe planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke’s side. The man bent, whispering into Leto’s ear.\nJessica recognized the capsign of Hawat’s corps, fought down uneasiness. She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer’s feminine companion—a\ntiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.\n“You've hardly touched your dinner, my dear,” Jessica said. “May | order you something?”\nThe woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: “I’m not very hungry.”\nAbruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of command: “Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention.” He Stepped aside. “Paul, take over as host for me, if you please.”\nPaul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father’s chair, sat down in tt.\nThe Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: “Gurney, please take Paul’s place at table. We mustn’t have an odd number here. When the dinner’s over, | may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call.”\nHalleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.\n“There’s no need for alarm,” the Duke said, “but | must ask that no one leave until our house guard says It’s safe. You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and we'll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.”\nPaul caught the code words in his father’s message— guard-safe-secure-shortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read the same message. They both relaxed.\nThe Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper.\nPaul said: “Please go on with your dinner. | believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water.”\n“May we discuss it another time?” Kynes asked.\n“By all means,” Paul said.\nAnd Jessica noted with pride her son’s dignity, the mature sense of assurance.\nThe banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. “None of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps you’ve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like aman.”\nJessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a hand signal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard.\nBewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.\nPaul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards, looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: “Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He—”\n“Drowned?” It was the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter.\nPaul hesitated, then: “Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.”\n“What an interesting way to die,” she murmured.\nPaul’s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. “The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders—made by another fisherman’s claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat—a craft for traveling on water—that foundered...sank beneath the water. Another fisherman helping recover the body said he’d seen marks like this man’s wounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellow’s shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface—to reach air.”\n“Why is this interesting?” the banker asked.\n“Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable— except when you see it happen in the drawing room.” Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: “And, | should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.”\nA sudden stillness enfolded the room.\nThat was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The house troopers were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.\n“Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!” It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with complete abandon.\nNervous smiles appeared around the table.\nBewt was grinning.\nThe banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.\nKynes said: “One baits an Atreides at his own risk.”\n“Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?” the banker demanded.\nBefore Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: “Sir!” And she thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature’s game. Is he here to try for Paul? Does he have help?\n“My son displays a general garment and you claim it’s cut to your fit?” Jessica asked. “What a fascinating revelation.” She slid a hand down to her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.\nThe banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had focused on the code word: garment. “Prepare for violence.”\nKynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek.\nThe smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. “FII give you a toast,” he said. “To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his actions.”\nWhy do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.\nThe banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent’s face.\nPeople began responding all around the table.\nWhere Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides with Paul. What’s the secret of his power? It can’t be because he’s Judge of the\nChange. That’s temporary. And certainly not because he’s a civil servant.\nShe removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind.\nOnly Paul and the banker—(Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica thought.)—remained empty- handed. The banker’s attention stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate.\n| was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.\nHalleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him: “In our society, people shouldn't be quick to take offense. It’s frequently suicidal.” He looked at the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter beside him. “Don’t you think so, miss?”\n“Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed | do,” she said. “There’s too much violence. It makes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It doesn’t make sense.”\n“Indeed it doesn’t,” Halleck said.\nJessica saw the near perfection of the girl’s act, realized: That empty-headed little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been the first to see it—his training hadn’t overlooked that obvious gambit.\nKynes spoke to the banker: “Isn't another apology in order?”\nThe banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: “My Lady, | fear I’ve overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I’m not accustomed to it.”\nJessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: “When strangers meet, great allowance Should be made for differences of custom and training.”\n“Thank you, my Lady,” he said.\nThe dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward Jessica, said: “The Duke spoke of our being secure here. | do hope that doesn’t mean more fighting.”\nShe was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.\n“Likely this will prove unimportant,” Jessica said. “But there’s so much detail requiring the Duke’s personal attention in these times. As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.” She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. “And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.” She shifted her attention to Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”\n“Indeed it is,” Kynes said.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: “I do believe I'll eat something now. I’d like some of that bird dish you served earlier.”\nJessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were speaking"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_87e067209c8da6b433bfbe189ac01baed4c73319f0a20750b2b2614c0308a584_v2"}
