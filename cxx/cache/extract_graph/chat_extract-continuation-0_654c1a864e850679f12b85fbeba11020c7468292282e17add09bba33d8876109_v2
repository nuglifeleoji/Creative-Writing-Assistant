上升去。由于这座建筑的结构，电梯是斜着上升的。\n　　当显示板上的绿色数字跳到98时，电梯的门滑开了，两个孩子跑了出去。\n　　他们的面前是一条铺着厚厚的绿色地毯的安静的走廊，照明灯藏在墙壁中，使走廊的顶板和两壁都发出柔和的蓝光。在走廊的尽头，有一扇闭得严严实实的不锈钢自动门，门上有银色的不锈钢大字：通讯中心。\n　　门的上方还有闪着红光的字：\n　　正在工作。\n　　有一个人倒在门前，他是这个走廊中唯一的一个人。华华和小梦跨过他，咚咚地敲门，却见门正中的一个发光显示板上出现这样的一句话：\n　　请出示识别卡！\n　　华华看了一眼倒下的那个人，从他的胸前取下一张白色卡片，冲着自动门上方的一个摄象机似的东西晃了一下。门并没有开，显示板上又换了一句话：请把手放到指纹校验板上.....。在显示板旁边有一块贴在自动门上的光滑的金属片，华华试着把手按上去，显示板上的立刻出现一行字：指纹校验与识别卡不符！\n　　自动门仍纹丝不动。华华只好拿起躺在地上的那人发烫的手，但跟本够不着校验板.\n　　小梦蹲下去，使劲把那个昏迷中的人的沉重的身躯向上抬，华华也拚命向上拉他，终于把他的手按到那块金属片上，自动门无声地开了。\n　　这是一个宽敞的大厅，它的墙壁全是一种半透明的乳白色材料，似乎可以看进去很深。\n　　整个天花板都发出柔和的白光，明镜般光滑的地板放着一长排电脑终端机，这些终端机的屏幕大部分都亮着；还有几台电脑打印机，它们都拖出长长的白色纸带，再就是一个角落的一台保密碎纸机。\n　　大厅中就这些东西，与孩子想象的不同，根本没有那些通讯用的笨重的交换机之类的设备，最令他们吃惊的是，这个号称通讯中心的大厅中竟连一部电话机都看不到！大厅不多的设备看起来都十分精致，整个大厅显得空旷而神秘，就象科幻影片中那些虽空旷但到处充满魔力的大厅一样。\n　　在大厅的地板上躺着三名穿白色工作服的工作人员，另外还有一个穿西装的人靠在一台终端机前的一把椅子上。虽然他的脸上因高烧而出现了许多水泡，孩子们还是能认出他是电视上每天出现的那个人。播音员缓缓地抬起头来，向孩子们摆摆手，示意他们过来。\n　　当孩子们来到他身边后，他抬起一支紧紧抓着一张纸的手，开始向他们说什么，但随着他那满是水泡的嘴唇的张合，已被高烧所损坏的的声带只能发出嘶哑的气流声.以向世界传播话音为职业的他，在生命还未完结时�\n######################\nOutput:",
