It’s in the records.”\nLeto waited patiently, wondering how long it would be until the tamed history failed to satisfy this Duncan.\n“What do you really look like?” Idaho asked. “What’s this sandworm body the Tleilaxu described?”\n“It will make sandworms of sorts someday. It’s already far down the road of metamorphosis.”\n“What do you mean of sorts?”\n“It will have more ganglia. It will be aware.”\n“Can't we have some light? I'd like to see you.”\nLeto commanded the floodlights. Brilliant illumination filled the room. The black walls and the lighting had been arranged to focus the illumination on Leto, every visible detail revealed.\nIdaho swept his gaze along the faceted silvery-gray body, noted the beginnings of a sandworm’s ribbed sections, the sinuous flexings .. . the small protuberances which had once been feet and legs, one of them somewhat shorter\nthan the other. He brought his attention back to the well- defined arms and hands and finally lifted his attention to the cowled face with its pink skin almost lost in the immensity, a ridiculous extrusion on such a body.\n“Well, Duncan,” Leto said. “You were warned.”\nIdaho gestured mutely toward the pre-worm body.\nLeto asked it for him: “Why?”\nIdaho nodded.\n“I’m still Atreides, Duncan, and | assure you with all the honor of that name, there were compelling reasons.”\n“What could possibly .. .”\n“You will learn in time.”\nIdaho merely shook his head from side to side.\n“It’s not a pleasant revelation,” Leto said. “It requires that you learn other things first. Trust the word of an Atreides.”\nOver the centuries, Leto had found that this invocation of Idaho’s profound loyalties to all things Atreides dampened the immediate wellspring of personal questions. Once more, the formula worked.\n“So I’m to serve the Atreides again,” Idaho said. “That sounds familiar. Is it?”\n“In many ways, old friend.”\n“Old to you, maybe, but not to me. How will | serve?”\n“Didn’t my Fish Speakers tell you?”\n“They said | would command your elite Guard, a force chosen from among them. | don’t understand that. An army of women?”\n“| need a trusted companion who can command my Guard. You object?”\n“Why women?”\n“There are behavioral differences between the sexes which make women extremely valuable in this role.”\n“You're not answering my question.”\n“You think them inadequate?”\n“Some of them looked pretty tough, but...”\n“Others were, ahhh, soft with you?”\nIdaho blushed.\nLeto found this a charming reaction. The Duncans were among the few humans of these times who could do this. It was understandable, a product of the Duncans’ early training, their sense of personal honor—very chivalrous.\n“I don’t see why you trust women to protect you,” Idaho said. The blood slowly receded from his cheeks. He glared at Leto.\n“But | have always trusted them as | trust you—with my life.”\n“What do we protect you from?”\n“Moneo and my Fish Speakers will bring you up to date.”\nIdaho shifted from one foot to the other, his body swaying in a heartbeat rhythm. He stared around the small room, his eyes not focusing. With the abruptness of sudden decision, he returned his attention to Leto.\n“What do | call you?”\nIt was the sign of acceptance for which Leto had been waiting. “Will Lord Leto do?”\n“Yes ...m’Lord.” Idaho stared directly into Leto’s Fremen- blue eyes. “Is it true what your Fish Speakers say—you have... memories of...”\n“We're all here, Duncan.” Leto spoke it in the voice of his paternal grandfather, then:\n“Even the women are here, Duncan.” It was the voice of Jessica, Leto’s paternal grandmother.\n“You knew them well,” Leto said. “And they know you.”\nIdaho inhaled a slow, trembling breath. “That will take a little getting used to.”\n“My own initial reaction exactly,” Leto said.\nAn explosion of laughter shook Idaho, and Leto thought it more than the weak jest deserved, but he remained silent.\nPresently, Idaho said: “Your Fish Speakers were supposed to put me in a good mood, weren’t they?”\n“Did they succeed?”\nIdaho studied Leto’s face, recognizing the distinctive Atreides features.\n“You Atreides always did know me too well,” Idaho said.\n“That’s better,” Leto said. “You’re beginning to accept that I’m not just one Atreides. I’m all of them.”\n“Paul said that once.”\n“So | did!” As much as the original personality could be conveyed by tone and accent, it was Muad’Dib speaking.\nIdaho gulped, looked away at the room’s door.\n“You've taken something away from us,” he said. “I can feel it. Those women ... Moneo...”\nUs against you, Leto thought. The Duncans always choose the human side.\nIdaho returned his attention to Leto’s face. “What have you given us in exchange?”\n“Throughout the Empire, Leto’s Peace!”\n“And | can see that everyone's delightfully happy! That’s why you need a personal guard.”\nLeto smiled. “My peace is actually enforced tranquility. Humans have a long history of reacting against tranquility.”\n“So you give us the Fish Speakers.”\n“And a hierarchy you can identify without any mistakes.”\n“A female army,” Idaho muttered.\n“The ultimate male-enticing force,” Leto said. “Sex always was a way of subduing the aggressive male.”\n“Is that what they do?”\n“They prevent or ameliorate excesses which could lead to more painful violence.”\n“And you let them believe you’re a god. | don’t think | like this.”\n“The curse of holiness is as offensive to me as it is to you!”\nIdaho frowned. It was not the response he had expected.\n“What kind of game are you playing, Lord Leto?”\n“A very old one but with new rules.”\n“Your rules!”\n“Would you rather | turned it all back to CHOAM and Landsraad and the Great Houses?”\n“The Tleilaxu say there is no more Landsraad. You don’t allow any real self-rule.”\n“Well then, | could step aside for the Bene Gesserit. Or maybe the Ixians or the Tleilaxu? Would you like me to find another Baron Harkonnen to assume power over the Empire? Say the word, Duncan, and l'Il abdicate!”\nUnder this avalanche of meanings, Idaho again shook his head from side to side.\n“In the wrong hands,” Leto said, “monolithic centralized power is a dangerous and volatile instrument.”\n“And your hands are the right ones?”\n“I’m not certain about my hands, but | will tell you, Duncan, I’m certain about the hands of those who’ve gone before me. | know them.”\nIdaho turned his back on Leto.\nWhat a fascinating, ultimately human gesture, Leto thought. Rejection coupled to acceptance of his vulnerability.\nLeto spoke to Idaho’s back.\n“You object quite rightly that | use people without their full knowledge and consent.”\nIdaho turned his profile to Leto, then turned his head to look up at the cowled face, cocking his head forward a bit to peer into the all-blue eyes.\nHe is studying me, Leto thought, but he has only the face to measure me by.\nThe Atreides had taught their people to know the subtle signals of face and body, and Idaho was good at it, but the realization could be seen coming over him: he was beyond his depth here.\nIdaho cleared his throat. “What’s the worst thing you would ask of me?”\nHow like a Duncan! Leto thought. This one was a classic. Idaho would give his loyalty to an Atreides, to the guardian\nof his oath, but he sent a signal that he would not go beyond the personal limits of his own morality.\n“You will be asked to guard me by whatever means necessary, and you will be asked to guard my secret.”\n“What secret?”\n“That | am vulnerable.”\n“That you’re not God?”\n“Not in that ultimate sense.”\n“Your Fish Speakers talk about rebels.”\n“They exist.”\n“Why?”\n“They are young and | have not convinced them that my way is better. It’s very difficult convincing the young of anything. They’re born knowing so much.”\n“| never before heard an Atreides sneer at the young that way.”\n“Perhaps it’s because I’m so much older—old compounded by old. And my task gets more difficult with each passing generation.”\n“What is your task?”\n“You will come to understand it as we go along.”\n“What happens if | fail you? Do your women eliminate me?”\n“I try not to burden the Fish Speakers with guilt.”\n“But you would burden me?”\n“If you accept it.”\n“If | find that you’re worse than the Harkonnens, l'Il turn against you.”\nHow like a Duncan. They measure all evil against the Harkonnens. How little they know of evil.\nLeto said: “The Baron ate whole planets, Duncan. What could be worse than that?”\n“Eating the Empire.”\n“Lam pregnant with my Empire. l'Il die giving birth to it.”\n“If | could believe that...”\n“Will you command my Guard?”\n“Why me?”\n“You're the best.”\n“Dangerous work, l’d imagine. Is that how my predecessors died, doing your dangerous work?”\n“Some of them.”\n“I wish | had the memories of those others!”\n“You couldn’t have and still be the original.”\n“I want to learn about them, though.”\n“You will.”\n“So the Atreides still need a sharp knife?”\n“We have jobs that only a Duncan Idaho can do.”\n“You say...we...” Idaho swallowed, looked at the door, then at Leto’s face.\nLeto spoke to him as Muad’Dib would have, but still in the Leto-voice.\n“When we climbed to Sietch Tabr for the last time together, you had my loyalty then and | had yours. Nothing of that has really changed.”\n“That was your father.”\n“That was me!” Paul Muad’Dib’s voice of command coming from Leto’s bulk always shocked the gholas.\nIdaho whispered: “All of you. ..in that one... body...” He broke off.\nLeto remained silent. This was the decision moment. Presently, Idaho permitted himself that devil-may-care grin for which he had been so well known. “Then | will speak to the first Leto and to Paul, the ones who know me best.\nUse me well, for | did love you.”\nLeto closed his eyes. Such words always distressed him. He knew it was love to which he was most vulnerable.\nMoneo, who had been listening, came to the rescue. He entered and said: “Lord, shall | take Duncan Idaho to the guards he will command?”\n“Yes.” The one word was all that Leto could manage.\nMoneo took Idaho’s arm and led him away.\nGood Moneo, Leto thought. So good. He knows me so well, but | despair of his ever understanding me.\n| know the evil of my ancestors because | am those people. The balance is delicate in the extreme. | know that few of you who read my words have ever thought about your ancestors this way. It has not occurred to you that your ancestors were survivors and that the survival itself sometimes involved savage decisions, a kind of wanton brutality which civilized\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the Atreides ruler with a sandworm body, possessing memories of his ancestors and ruling the Empire with enforced tranquility.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a loyal servant of the Atreides, resurrected as a ghola, and now tasked with commanding Leto's elite Guard.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a trusted advisor to Leto, assisting in the management of the Empire and the Fish Speakers.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's elite female guard, tasked with protecting him and maintaining his peace.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atreides are a noble family with a long history of leadership and conflict, now embodied in Leto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and manipulative group known for their genetic engineering, including the creation of gholas.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit are a powerful sisterhood with deep political and genetic influence in the Empire.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixians are a technologically advanced group often at odds with the ruling powers.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CHOAM is a powerful economic entity that once controlled much of the Empire's trade.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANDSRAAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Landsraad was a political body representing the Great Houses, now dissolved under Leto's rule.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT HOUSES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Great Houses are the noble families that once held significant power in the Empire.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Harkonnens are a notorious family known for their brutality, often used as a benchmark for evil.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPIRE<|>GEO<|>The Empire is the vast domain ruled by Leto, encompassing many planets and factions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen stronghold with historical significance to the Atreides.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location where hostages or prisoners are held, mentioned in the context of the hostage exchange.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO'S PEACE<|>EVENT<|>Leto's Peace is the enforced tranquility across the Empire, maintained by the Fish Speakers and other measures.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LETO<|>Duncan Idaho serves Leto as the commander of his elite Guard, a role rooted in deep loyalty to the Atreides.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>LETO<|>Moneo is a trusted advisor to Leto, assisting in the management of the Empire and the Fish Speakers.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>LETO<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's elite female guard, tasked with protecting him and maintaining his peace.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATREIDES<|>LETO<|>Leto embodies the Atreides lineage, ruling the Empire with their legacy and memories.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>The Tleilaxu created Duncan Idaho as a ghola, resurrecting him to serve the Atreides.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>LETO<|>The Bene Gesserit are a potential rival or ally to Leto's rule, with deep political influence.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIANS<|>LETO<|>The Ixians are a technologically advanced group often at odds with Leto's rule.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOAM<|>LETO<|>CHOAM was a powerful economic entity that Leto has supplanted in his rule of the Empire.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LANDSRAAD<|>LETO<|>The Landsraad was dissolved under Leto's rule, centralizing power in his hands.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HOUSES<|>LETO<|>The Great Houses have lost their power under Leto's centralized rule.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>LETO<|>The Harkonnens are a benchmark for evil, against which Leto measures his own actions.<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>ATREIDES<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen stronghold with historical significance to the Atreides.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO'S PEACE<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Leto's Peace is maintained by the Fish Speakers, who enforce tranquility across the Empire.<|>8\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
