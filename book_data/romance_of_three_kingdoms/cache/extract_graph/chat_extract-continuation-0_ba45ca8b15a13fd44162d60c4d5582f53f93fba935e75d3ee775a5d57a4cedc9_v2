贡议事。贡至，策出书示之，叱曰：“汝欲送我于死地耶！”命武士绞杀之。贡家属皆逃散。有家客三人，欲为许贡报仇，恨无其便。一日，孙策引军会猎于丹徒之西山，赶起一大鹿，策纵马上山逐之。正赶之间，只见树林之内有三个人持枪带弓面立。策勒马问曰：“汝等何人？”答曰：“乃韩当军士也。在此射鹿。”策方举辔欲行，一人拈枪望策左腿便刺。策大惊，急取佩剑从马上砍去，剑刃忽坠，止存剑靶在手。一人早拈弓搭箭射来，正中孙策面颊。策就拔面上箭，取弓回射放箭之人，应弦面倒。那二人举枪向孙策乱搠，大叫曰：“我等是许贡家客，特来为主人报仇！”策别无器械，只以弓拒之，且拒且走。二人死战不退。策身被数枪，马亦带伤。正危急之时，程普引数人至。孙策大叫：“杀贼！“程普引众齐上，将许贡家客砍为肉泥。看孙策时，血流满面，被伤至重，乃以刀割抱，裹其伤处，救回吴会养病。后人有诗赞许家三客曰：“孙郎智勇冠江湄，射猎山中受困危。许客三人能死义，杀身豫让未为奇。”却说孙策受伤而回，使人寻请华伦医治。不想华佗已往中原去了，止有徒弟在吴，命其治疗。其徒曰：“箭头有药，毒已入骨。须静养百日，方可无虞。若怒气冲激，其疮难治。”孙策为人最是性急，恨不得即日便愈。将息到二十余日，忽闻张纮有使者自许昌回，策唤问之。使者曰：“曹操甚惧主公；其帐下谋士，亦俱敬服；惟有郭嘉不服。”策曰：“郭嘉曾有何说？”使者不敢言。策怒，固问之。使者只得从实告曰：“郭嘉曾对曹操言主公不足惧也：轻而无备，性急少谋，乃匹夫之勇耳，他日必死于小人之手。”策闻言，大怒曰：“匹夫安敢料吾！吾誓取许昌！”遂不待疮愈，便欲商议出兵。张昭谏曰：“医者戒主公百日休动，今何因一时之忿，自轻万金之躯？”正话间，忽报袁绍遣使陈震至。策唤入问之。震具言袁绍欲结东吴为外应，共攻曹操。策大喜，即日会诸将于城楼上，设宴款待陈震。饮酒之间，忽见诸将互相耳语，纷纷下楼。策怪问何故，左右曰：“有于神仙者，今从楼下过，诸将欲往拜之耳。”策起身凭栏观之，见一道人，身披鹤氅，手携藜杖，立于当道，百姓俱焚\n######################\nOutput:",
