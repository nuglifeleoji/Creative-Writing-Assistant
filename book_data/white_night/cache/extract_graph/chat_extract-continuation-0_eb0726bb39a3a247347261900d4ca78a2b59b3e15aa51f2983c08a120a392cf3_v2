   蓝潇呆呆的道：“植物人么？”\n\n    医生苦笑道：“有可能。现在就要靠他自己了，如果能醒过来，一切都会恢复的很好。但如果醒不过来，恐怕就麻烦了……，具体多长时间能够清醒，我们也不知道。只能看他自己。”\n\n    “哇……”南澄一下就哭了出来。早上起来还好好的，蹦蹦跳跳的儿子，这一会儿的工夫怎么就这样了，蓝潇才刚回来，好不容易一家团聚了，蓝轩宇却要面临生死危机，这简直让她无法想像、更无法接受。\n\n    蓝潇搂住南澄，沉声道：“医生，还有什么其他办法吗？”\n\n    医生摇摇头，道：“就算是精神系的魂师，现在也不能去刺激他的大脑，就怕一下崩溃了，那就麻烦了。”\n\n    “谢谢你……”\n\n    牧重天一直站在旁边，听了医生的话，不禁痛苦的闭上了双眼。多优秀的一个孩子啊！竟然、竟然因为自己的失误而导致了昏迷。这简直是……，不可原谅啊！\n\n    蓝轩宇陷入了深度昏迷之中，所有治疗费用自然都是由天罗学院来支付。而牧重天也受到了极其严厉的惩罚。从一名主任级老师被降级成为普通老师。\n\n    但这终究是一次意外，没有刑事责任追究。\n\n    天罗学院提出给予蓝轩宇巨额赔偿。却被蓝潇拒绝了，对于蓝潇和南澄来说，金钱现在一点都不重要，他们只是希望，自己的孩子能够活下来、能够醒过来。\n\n    三天后。\n\n    重症监护室外。\n\n    叶灵瞳默默的站在窗外，看着躺在病床上，脸色苍白，头上插满各种仪器的蓝轩宇。\n\n    她的俏脸也有些苍白，泪水大滴、大滴的滑落。\n\n    三天了，她每天晚上睡觉，脑海中都会浮现出蓝轩宇射出冰锥把三眼魔猿引走的一幕。如果不是他，当时自己一定会被三眼魔猿杀死吧。\n\n    他是为了救自己，才变成现在这个样子的啊！\n\n    蓝轩宇，对不起。\n\n    无疑，高能天才班选拔之中，叶\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
