called.\nDust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward the outer door.\nThe Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ship’s side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. “We will make our stand here!” the Emperor ordered.\nAnother crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber admitting windblown sand and the sound of shouting. A small, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light—Alia darting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect the Emperor’s retreat.\n“Save yourself, Sire!” a Sardaukar officer shouted. “Into the ship!”\nBut the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors. A forty-meter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the selamlik’s doors opened now onto drifting sand. A dust cloud hung low over the outside world blowing from pastel distances. Static lightning crackled from the cloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted out by the storm’s charge could be seen through the haze. The plain surged with figures in combat—Sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed men who seemed to come down out of the storm.\nAll this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor’s pointing hand.\nOut of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes—great rising curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of Sandworms, a massed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack. They came in a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on the plain.\nOnward toward the Emperor’s hutment they came while the House Sardaukar stood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their minds found difficult to accept.\nBut the figures leaping from the worm backs were men, and the blades flashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had been trained to face. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man to man on the plain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar bodyguard pressed the Emperor back into the ship, sealed the door on him, and prepared to die at the door as part of his shield.\nIn the shock of comparative silence within the ship, the Emperor stared at the wide-eyed faces of his suite, seeing his oldest daughter with the flush of exertion on her cheeks, the old Truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her hood pulled about her face, finding at last the faces he sought—the two Guildsmen. They wore the Guild gray, unadorned, and it seemed to fit the calm they maintained despite the high emotions around them.\nThe taller of the two, though, held a hand to his left eye. As the Emperor watched, someone jostled\nthe Guildsman’s arm, the hand moved, and the eye was revealed. The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses, and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black.\nThe smaller of the pair eloowed his way a step nearer the Emperor, said: “We cannot know how it will go.” And the taller companion, hand restored to eye, added in a cold voice: “But this Muad’Dib cannot know, either.”\nThe words shocked the Emperor out of his daze. He checked the scorn on his tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild navigator’s single- minded focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain. Were these two so dependent upon their faculty that they had lost the use of their eyes and their reason? he wondered.\n“Reverend Mother,” he said, “we must devise a plan.”\nShe pulled the hood from her face, met his gaze with an unblinking stare. The look that passed between them carried complete understanding. They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.\n“Summon Count Fenring from his quarters,” the Reverend Mother said.\nThe Padishah Emperor nodded, waved for one of his aides to obey that command.\nHe was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad’Dib’s motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad’Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies’ skins, the Muad’Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: “I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.”\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| t was to the Arrakeen governor’s mansion, the old Residency the Atreides had first occupied on Dune, that they escorted Paul-Muad’Dib on the evening of his victory. The building stood as Rabban had restored it, virtually untouched by the fighting although there had been looting by townspeople. Some of the furnishings in the main hall had been overturned or smashed.\nPaul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a pace behind. Their escort fanned out into the Great Hall, straightening the place and clearing an area for Muad’Dib. One Squad began investigating that no sly trap had been planted here.\n“| remember the day we first came here with your father,” Gurney said. He glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. “I didn’t like this place then and | like it less now. One of our caves would be safer.”\n“Spoken like a true Fremen,” Stilgar said, and he marked the cold smile that his words brought to Muad’Dib’s lips. “Will you reconsider, Muad’Dib?”\n“This place is a symbol,” Paul said. “Rabban lived here. By occupying this place | seal my victory for all to understand. Send men through the building. Touch nothing. Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys remain.”\n“AS you command,” Stilgar said, and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he turned to obey.\nCommunications men hurried into the room with their equipment, began setting up near the massive fireplace. The Fremen guard that augmented the Surviving Fedaykin took up stations around the room. There was muttering among them, much darting of Suspicious glances. This had been too long a place of the enemy for them to accept their presence in it casually.\n“Gurney, have an escort bring my mother and Chani,” Paul said. “Does Chani know yet about our son?”\n“The message was sent, m’Lord.”\n“Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet?”\n“Yes, m’Lord. The storm’s almost spent.”\n“What’s the extent of the storm damage?” Paul asked.\n“In the direct path—on the landing field and across the spice storage yards of the plain—extensive damage,” Gurney said. “As much from battle as from the storm.”\n“Nothing money won't repair, | presume,” Paul said.\n“Except for the lives, m’Lord,” Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: “When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?”\nBut Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps visible to him in the time-wall that still lay across his path. Through each gap the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future.\nHe sighed, crossed the hall, seeing a chair against the wall. The chair had once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father. At the moment, though, it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from the men. He sat down, pulling his robes around his legs, loosening his stillsuit at the neck.\n“The Emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship,” Gurney said.\n“For now, contain him there,” Paul said. “Have they found the Harkonnens yet?”\n“They're still examining the dead.”\n“What reply from the ships up there?” He jerked his chin toward the ceiling.\n“No reply yet, m’Lord.”\nPaul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said: “Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We\nmust send a message to our Emperor. It’s time to discuss terms.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\nGurney turned away, dropped a hand signal to one of the Fedaykin who took up close-guard position beside Paul.\n“Gurney,” Paul whispered. “Since we've been rejoined I’ve yet to hear you produce the proper quotation for the event.” He turned, saw Gurney swallow, saw the sudden grim hardening of the man’s jaw.\n“As you wish, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He cleared his throat, rasped: “‘And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.”\nPaul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as he had once waited to mourn his father. Now, he gave his thoughts over to this day’s accumulated discoveries—the mixed futures and the hidden presence of Alia within his awareness.\nOf all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. “I have breasted the future to place my words where only you can hear them,” Alia had said. “Even you cannot do that, my brother. | find it an interesting play. And...oh, yes—l’ve killed our grandfather, the demented old Baron. He had very little pain.”\nSilence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal.\n“Muad’Dib.”\nPaul opened his eyes to see Stilgar’s black- bearded visage above him, the dark eyes glaring with\nbattle light.\n“You've found the body of the old Baron,” Paul said.\nA hush of the person settled over Stilgar. “How could you know?” he whispered. “We just found the body in that great pile of metal the Emperor built.”\nPaul ignored the question, seeing Gurney return accompanied by two Fremen who supported a captive Sardaukar.\n“Here’s one of them, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of Paul.\nThe Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers.\n“I think this one’s an officer, m’Lord,” Gurney said.\nPaul nodded, said: “I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that, man?”\nThe Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.\n“Speak up,” Paul said, “or your Emperor may die.”\nThe man blinked, swallowed.\n“Who am I?” Paul demanded.\n", "’s one of them, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of Paul.\nThe Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers.\n“I think this one’s an officer, m’Lord,” Gurney said.\nPaul nodded, said: “I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that, man?”\nThe Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.\n“Speak up,” Paul said, “or your Emperor may die.”\nThe man blinked, swallowed.\n“Who am I?” Paul demanded.\n“You are the Duke Paul Atreides,” the man husked.\nHe seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been prepared for such happenings as this day. They’d never known anything but victory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness\nin itself. He put that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program.\n“I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor,” Paul said. And he couched his words in the ancient formula: “I, a Duke of a Great House, an Imperial Kinsman, give my word of bond under the Convention. If the Emperor and his people lay down their arms and come to me here | will guard their lives with my own.” Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the Sardaukar to see. “I Swear it by this.”\nThe man wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Gurney.\n“Yes,” Paul said. “Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of Gurney Halleck.”\n“I will carry the message,” the Sardaukar said.\n“Take him to our forward command post and send him in,” Paul said.\n“Yes, m’Lord.” Gurney motioned for the guard to obey, led them out.\nPaul turned back to Stilgar.\n“Chani and your mother have arrived,” Stilgar said. “Chani has asked time to be alone with her grief. The Reverend Mother sought a moment in the weirding room; | Know not why.”\n“My mother’s sick with longing for a planet she may never see,” Paul said. “Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you cannot walk between them.”\n“Water from the sky,” Stilgar whispered.\nIn that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen naib to a creature of\nthe Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it.\n| have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.\nIn a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room, noting how proper and on-review his guards had become in his presence. He sensed the subtle, prideful competition among them—each hoping for notice from Muad’Dib.\nMuad’Dib from whom all blessings flow, he thought, and it was the bitterest thought of his life. They sense that | must take the throne, he thought. But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad.\nStilgar cleared his throat, said: “Rabban, too, is dead.”\nPaul nodded.\nGuards to the right suddenly snapped aside, standing at attention to open an aisle for Jessica. She wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding across sand, but Paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what she had once been here—concubine to a ruling duke. Her presence carried some of its old assertiveness.\nJessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his fatigue and how he hid it, but found no compassion for him. It was as though she had been rendered incapable of any emotion for her son.\nJessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to fit itself snugly in to her memories. It remained a foreign room, as though she had never walked here, never walked here with her\nbeloved Leto, never confronted a drunken Duncan Idaho here—never, never, never....\nThere should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding memory, she thought. There should be a word for memories that deny themselves.\n“Where is Alia?” she asked.\n“Out doing what any good Fremen child should be doing in such times,” Paul said. “She’s killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the water- recovery teams.”\n“Paul!”\n“You must understand that she does this out of kindness,” he said. “Isn’t it odd how we misunderstand the hidden unity of kindness and cruelty?”\nJessica glared at her son, shocked by the profound change in him. Was it his child’s death did this? she wondered. And she said: “The men tell strange Stories of you, Paul. They say you've all the powers of the legend—nothing can be hidden from you, that you see where others cannot see.”\n“A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends?” he asked.\n“I’ve had a hand in whatever you are,” she admitted, “but you mustn’t expect me to—”\n“How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives?” Paul asked. “There’s a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those experiences, the wisdom they’d bring. But wisdom tempers love, doesn’t it? And it puts a new shape on hate. How can you tell what’s ruthless unless you’ve plumbed the depths of\nboth cruelty and kindness? You should fear me, Mother. | am the Kwisatz Haderach.”\nJessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said: “Once you denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach.”\nPaul shook his head. “I can deny nothing anymore.” He looked up into her eyes. “The Emperor and his people come now. They will be announced any moment. Stand beside me. | wish a clear view of them. My future bride will be among them.”\n“Paul!” Jessica snapped. “Don’t make the mistake your father made!”\n“She’s a princess,” Paul said. “She’s my key to the throne, and that’s all she’ll ever be. Mistake? You think because I’m what you made me that | cannot feel the need for revenge?”\n“Even on the innocent?” she asked, and she thought: He must not make the mistakes I made.\n“There are no innocent anymore,” Paul said.\n“Tell that to Chani,” Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from the rear of the Residency.\nChani entered the Great Hall there, walking between the Fremen guards as though unaware of them. Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back, face mask fastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to stand beside Jessica.\nPaul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks— She gives water to the dead. He felt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he could only feel this thing through Chani’s presence.\n“He is dead, beloved,” Chani said. “Our son is dead.”\nHolding himself under stiff control, Paul got to his feet. He reached out, touched Chani’s cheek, feeling the dampness of her tears. “He cannot be replaced,” Paul said, “but there will be other sons. It is Usul who promises this.” Gently, he moved her aside, gestured to Stilgar.\n“Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.\n“They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people,” Paul said. “I will stand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in the center of the room. They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless | command otherwise.”\n“AS you command, Muad’Dib.”\nAs Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen guards: “You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!”\nThe Emperor’s entourage could be heard approaching now, his Sardaukar humming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits. There came a murmur of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the guard, crossed to confer with Stilgar, then moved to Paul’s side, a strange look in his eyes.\nWill | lose Gurney, too? Paul wondered. The way I lost Stilgar—losing a friend to gain a creature?\n“They have no throwing weapons,” Gurney said. “I’ve made sure of that myself.” He glanced around the room, seeing Paul’s preparations. “Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is with them. Shall | cut him out?”\n“Leave him.”\n“There’re some Guild people, too, demanding special privileges, threatening an embargo against Arrakis. | told them I’d give you their message.”\n“Let them threaten.”\n“Paul!” Jessica hissed behind him. “He’s talking about the Guild!”\n“I'll pull their fangs presently,” Paul said.\nAnd he thought then about the Guild—the force that had specialized for so long that it had become a parasite, unable to exist independently of the life upon which it fed. They had never dared grasp the sword...and now they could not grasp it. They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of specializing on the melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators. They could have done this, lived their glorious day and died. Instead, they’d existed from moment to moment, hoping the seas in which they swam might produce a new host when the old one died.\nThe Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal decision: they’d chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward into stagnation.\nLet them look closely at their new host, Paul thought.\n“There’s also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she’s a friend of your mother,” Gurney said.\n“My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends.”\nAgain, Gurney glanced around the Great Hall, then bent close to Paul’s ear. “Thufir Hawat’s with ’em, m’Lord. | had no chance to see him alone, but he used our old hand signs to say he’s been working\nwith the Harkonnens, thought you were dead. Says he’s to be left among ’em.”\n“You left Thufir among those—”\n“He wanted it...and | thought it best. If...there’s something wrong, he’s where we can control him. If not—we’ve an ear on the other side.”\nPaul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this moment—and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the Emperor commanded he use against “this upstart Duke.”\nThe entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short corridor of lances. There came a murmurous swish of garments, feet rasping the sand that had drifted into the Residency.\nThe Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His Burseg helmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His uniform’s left sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without weapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that kept his immediate area open.\nA Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had ordered. The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and of staring faces.\nPaul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of weeping,", " then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this moment—and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the Emperor commanded he use against “this upstart Duke.”\nThe entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short corridor of lances.

The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and of staring faces.\nPaul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of weeping, saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a Sardaukar victory and now stood choked to silence by defeat. Paul saw the bird-bright eyes of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring beneath her black hood,\nand beside her the narrow furtiveness of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.\nThere’s a face time betrayed to me, Paul thought.\nHe looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by a movement, seeing there a narrow, weaselish face he’d never before encountered—not in time or out of it. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a marker of fear.\nWhy should I fear that man? he wondered.\nHe leaned toward his mother, whispered: “That man to the left of the Reverend Mother, the evil- looking one—who is that?”\nJessica looked, recognizing the face from her Duke’s dossiers. “Count Fenring,” she said. “The one who was here immediately before us. A genetic- eunuch...and a killer.”\nThe Emperor’s errand boy, Paul thought. And the thought was a shock crashing across his consciousness because he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures—but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions.\nIt occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless reaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment of death.\nHave I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me? Paul wondered.\nThe thought sent a pang of foreboding through him. He forced his attention away from Fenring, looked now at the remnants of Sardaukar men and officers, the bitterness on their faces and the desperation. Here and there among them, faces\ncaught Paul’s attention briefly: Sardaukar officers measuring the preparations within this room, planning and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into victory.\nPaul’s attention came at last to a tall blonde woman, green-eyed, a face of patrician beauty, classic in its hauteur, untouched by tears, completely undefeated. Without being told it, Paul knew her— Princess Royal, Bene Gesserit-trained, a face that time vision had shown him in many aspects: Irulan.\nThere’s my key, he thought.\nThen he saw movement in the clustered people, a face and figure emerged—Thufir Hawat, the seamed old features with darkly stained lips, the hunched shoulders, the look of fragile age about him.\n“There’s Thufir Hawat,” Paul said. “Let him stand free, Gurney.”\n“M’Lord,” Gurney said.\n“Let him stand free,” Paul repeated.\nGurney nodded.\nHawat shambled forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him. The rheumy eyes peered at Paul, measuring, seeking.\nPaul stepped forward one pace, sensed the tense, waiting movement of the Emperor and his people.\nHawat’s gaze stabbed past Paul, and the old man Said: “Lady Jessica, | but learned this day how I’ve wronged you in my thoughts. You needn't forgive.”\nPaul waited, but his mother remained silent.\n“Thufir, old friend,” Paul said, “as you can see, my back is toward no door.”\n“The universe is full of doors,” Hawat said.\n“Am | my father’s son?” Paul asked.\n“More like your grandfather’s,” Hawat rasped. “You've his manner and the look of him in your eyes.” “Yet I’m my father’s son,” Paul said. “For | say to you, Thufir, that in payment for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything you wish of me. Anything at all. Do you need my life now, Thufir? It is yours.” Paul stepped forward a pace, hands at his side, seeing the look of awareness grow in Hawat’s\neyes.\nHe realizes that | know of the treachery, Paul thought.\nPitching his voice to carry in a half-whisper for Hawat’s ears alone, Paul said: “I mean this, Thufir. If you’re to strike me, do it now.”\n“I but wanted to stand before you once more, my Duke,” Hawat said. And Paul became aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted to keep from falling. Paul reached out, supported Hawat by the shoulders, feeling the muscle tremors beneath his hands.\n“Is there pain, old friend?” Paul asked.\n“There is pain, my Duke,” Hawat agreed, “but the pleasure is greater.” He half turned in Paul’s arms, extended his left hand, palm up, toward the Emperor, exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers. “See, Majesty?” he called. “See your traitor’s needle? Did you think that | who've given my life to service of the Atreides would give them less now?”\nPaul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms, felt the death there, the utter flaccidity. Gently, Paul\nlowered Hawat to the floor, straightened and signed for guardsmen to carry the body away.\nSilence held the hall while his command was obeyed.\nA look of deadly waiting held the Emperor’s face now. Eyes that had never admitted fear admitted it at last.\n“Majesty,” Paul said, and noted the jerk of Surprised attention in the tall Princess Royal. The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit controlled atonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that Paul could put there.\nBene Gesserit-trained indeed, Paul thought.\nThe Emperor cleared his throat, said: “Perhaps my respected kinsman believes he has things all his own way now. Nothing could be more remote from fact. You have violated the Convention, used atomics against—”\n“I used atomics against a natural feature of the desert,” Paul said. “It was in my way and I was ina hurry to get to you, Majesty, to ask your explanation for some of your strange activities.”\n“There’s a massed armada of the Great Houses in Space over Arrakis right now,” the Emperor said. “I’ve but to say the word and they’II—”\n“Oh, yes,” Paul said, “I almost forgot about them.” He searched through the Emperor’s suite until he saw the faces of the two Guildsmen, spoke aside to Gurney. “Are those the Guild agents, Gurney, the two fat ones dressed in gray over there?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“You two,” Paul said, pointing. “Get out of there immediately and dispatch messages that will get that fleet on its way home. After this, you’ll ask my permission before—”\n“The Guild doesn’t take your orders!” the taller of the two barked. He and his companion pushed through to the barrier lances, which were raised at a nod from Paul. The two men stepped out and the taller leveled an arm at Paul, said: “You may very well be under embargo for your—”\n“If | hear any more nonsense from either of you,” Paul said, “lIl give the order that'll destroy all spice production on Arrakis...forever.”\n“Are you mad?” the tall Guildsman demanded. He fell back half a step.\n“You grant that | have the power to do this thing, then?” Paul asked.\nThe Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment, then: “Yes, you could do it, but you must not.”\n“Ah-h-h,” Paul said and nodded to himself. “Guild navigators, both of you, eh?”\n“Yes!”\nThe shorter of the pair said: “You would blind yourself, too, and condemn us all to slow death. Have you any idea what it means to be deprived of the Spice liquor once you're addicted?”\n“The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever,” Paul said. “The Guild is crippled. Humans become little isolated clusters on their isolated planets. You know, | might do this thing out of pure spite...or out of ennui.”\n“Let us talk this over privately,” the taller Guildsman said. “I’m sure we can come to some compromise that is—”\n“Send the message to your people over Arrakis,” Paul said. “I grow tired of this argument. If that fleet over us doesn’t leave soon there'll be no need for us to talk.” He nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall. “You may use our equipment.”\n“First we must discuss this,” the tall Guildsman said. “We cannot just—”\n“Do it!” Paul barked. “The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it. You’ve agreed | have that power. We are not here to discuss or to negotiate or to compromise. You will obey my orders or suffer the immediate consequences!”\n“He means it,” the shorter Guildsman said. And Paul saw the fear grip them.\nSlowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment.\n“Will they obey?” Gurney asked.\n“They have a narrow vision of time,” Paul said. “They can see ahead to a blank wall marking the consequences of disobedience. Every Guild navigator on every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall. They'll obey.”\nPaul turned back to look at the Emperor, said: “When they permitted you to mount your father’s throne, it was only on the assurance that you’d keep the spice flowing. You’ve failed them, Majesty. Do you know the consequences?”\n“Nobody permitted me to—”\n“Stop playing the fool,” Paul barked. “The Guild is like a village beside a river. They need the water, but can only dip out what they require. They cannot dam the river and control it, because that focuses attention on what they take, it brings down eventual destruction. The spice flow, that’s their river, and | have built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river.”\nThe Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the two Guildsmen.\n“Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling,” Paul said. “There are other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once they’ve used the spice liquor, the others no longer work.”\nThe old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward out of the crowd to Stand at the barrier lances.\n“Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,” Paul said. “It has been a long time since Caladan, hasn't it?”\nShe looked past him at his mother, said: “Well, Jessica, | see that your son is indeed the one. For that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your daughter.”\nPaul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: “You’ve never had the right or cause"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_7958a21f732af7303df0a8416609666ceabf4d45129751f36955f3b7247f6d42_v2"}
