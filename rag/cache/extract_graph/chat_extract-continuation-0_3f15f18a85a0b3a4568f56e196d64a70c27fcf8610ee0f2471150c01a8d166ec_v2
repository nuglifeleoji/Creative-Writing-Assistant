Green tiles with figures of red fish worked into a sea pattern surrounded the water. Such an abundance of water occupied this space that a Fremen of old would have been outraged to see it used merely for washing human flesh.\nHe was near.\nIt was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend Mother who had presided at the sietch orgies. The tau awareness of her other-se/ves could supply any detail her curiosity required. This feeling of nearness could be nothing other than flesh reaching for flesh.\nNeed for action fought lethargy in the warm water.\nAbruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet and naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom. The chamber, oblong and skylighted, contained the gross and subtle instruments which toned a Bene Gesserit adept into ultimate physical and mental awareness/preparedness. There were mnemonic amplifiers, digit mills from Ix to strengthen and sensitize fingers and toes, odor synthesizers, tactility sensitizers, temperature gradient fields, pattern betrayers to prevent her falling into detectable habits, alpha-wave-response trainers, blink- synchronizers to tone abilities in light/dark/spectrum analysis...\nIn ten-centimeter letters along one wall, written by her own hand in mnemonic paint, stood the key reminder from the Bene Gesserit Creed:\n“Before us, all methods of learning were tainted by instinct. We learned how to learn. Before us, instinct-ridden researchers possessed a limited attention soan—often no longer than a single lifetime. Projects stretching across fifty or more lifetimes never occurred to them. The concept of total muscle/nerve training had not entered awareness.”\nAs she moved into the training room, Alia caught her own reflection multiplied thousands of times in the crystal prisms of a fencing mirror swinging in the heart of a target dummy. She saw the long sword waiting on its brackets against the target, and she thought: Yes! l'II work myself to exhaustion —drain the flesh and clear the mind.\nThe sword felt right in her hand. She slipped the crysknife from its sheath at her neck, held it sinister, tapped the\nactivating stud with the sword tip. Resistance came alive as the aura of the target shield built up, pushing her weapon Slowly and firmly away.\nPrisms glittered. The target slipped to her left.\nAlia followed with the tip of the long blade, thinking as she often did that the thing could almost be alive. But it was only servomotors and complex reflector circuits designed to lure the eyes away from danger, to confuse and teach. It was an instrument geared to react as she reacted, an anti- self which moved as she moved, balancing light on its prisms, shifting its target, offering its counter-blade.\nMany blades appeared to lunge at her from the prisms, but only one was real. She countered the real one, slipped the sword past shield resistance to tap the target. A marker light came alive: red and glistening among the prisms... more distraction.\nAgain the thing attacked, moving at one-marker speed now, just a bit faster than it had at the beginning.\nShe parried and, against all caution, moved into the danger zone, scored with the crysknife.\nTwo lights glowed from the prisms.\nAgain, the thing increased speed, moving out on its rollers, drawn like a magnet to the motions of her body and the tip of her sword.\nAttack—parry—counter.\nAttack—parry—counter...\nShe had four lights alive in there now, and the thing was becoming more dangerous, moving faster with each light, offering more areas of confusion.\nFive lights.\nSweat glistened on her naked skin. She existed now ina universe whose dimensions were outlined by the threatening blade, the target, bare feet against the practice floor, senses/nerves/muscles—motion against motion.\nAttack—parry—counter.\nSix lights...seven...\nEight!\nShe had never before risked eight.\nIn a recess of her mind there grew a sense of urgency, a crying out against such wildness as this. The instrument of prisms and target could not think, feel caution or remorse. And it carried a real blade. To go against less defeated the purpose of such training. That attacking blade could maim and it could kill. But the finest swordsmen in the Imperium never went against more than seven lights.\nNine!\nAlia experienced a sense of supreme exaltation. Attacking blade and target became blurs among blurs. She felt that the sword in her hand had come alive. She was an anti- target. She did not move the blade; it moved her.\nTen!\nEleven!\nSomething flashed past her shoulder, slowed at the shield aura around the target, slid through and tripped the deactivating stud. The lights darkened. Prisms and target twisted their way to stillness.\nAlia whirled, angered by the intrusion, but her reaction was thrown into tension by awareness of the supreme ability which had hurled that knife. It had been a throw timed to exquisite nicety—just fast enough to get through the shield zone and not too fast to be deflected.\nAnd it had touched a one-millimeter spot within an eleven-light target.\nAlia found her own emotions and tensions running down in a manner not unlike that of the target dummy. She was not at all surprised to see who had thrown the knife.\nPaul stood just inside the training room doorway, Stilgar three steps behind him. Her brother’s eyes were squinted in anger.\nAlia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the idea amusing. What the eyes had seen\ncould not be erased. Slowly, she replaced the crysknife in its Sheath at her neck.\n“I might’ve known,” she said.\n“| presume you know how dangerous that was,” Paul said. He took his time reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions coloring her skin, the wet fullness of her lips. There was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister. He found it odd that he could look at a person who was this close to him and no longer recognize her in the identity framework which had seemed so fixed and familiar.\n“That was madness,” Stilgar rasped, coming up to stand beside Paul.\nThe words were angry, but Alia heard awe in his voice, Saw it in his eyes.\n“Eleven lights,” Paul said, shaking his head.\n“I'd have made it twelve if you hadn’t interfered,” she said. She began to pale under his close regard, added: “And why do the damned things have that many lights if we’re not supposed to try for them?”\n“A Bene Gesserit should ask the reasoning behind an open-ended system?” Paul asked.\n“I Suppose you never tried for more than seven!” she said, anger returning. His attentive posture began to annoy her.\n“Just once,” Paul said. “Gurney Halleck caught me on ten. My punishment was sufficiently embarrassing that | won’t tell you what he did. And speaking of embarrassment...”\n“Next time, perhaps you'll have yourselves announced,” she said. She brushed past Paul into the bedroom, found a loose gray robe, slipped into it, began brushing her hair before a wall mirror. She felt sweaty, sad, a post-coitum kind of sadness that left her with a desire to bathe once more... and to sleep. “Why’re you here?” she asked.\n“My Lord,” Stilgar said. There was an odd inflection in his voice that brought Alia around to stare at him.\n“We're here at Irulan’s suggestion,” Paul said, “as strange as that may seem. She believes, and information in Stil’s possession appears to confirm it, that our enemies are about to make a major try for—”\n“My Lord!” Stilgar said, his voice sharper.\nAs her brother turned, questioning, Alia continued to look at the old Fremen Naib. Something about him now made her intensely aware that he was one of the primitives. Stilgar believed in a supernatural world very near him. It spoke to him in a simple pagan tongue dispelling all doubts. The natural universe in which he stood was fierce, unstoppable, and it lacked the common morality of the Imperium.\n“Yes, Stil,” Paul said. “Do you want to tell her why we came?”\n“This isn’t the time to talk of why we came,” Stilgar said.\n“What’s wrong, Stil?”\nStilgar continued to stare at Alia. “Sire, are you blind?”\nPaul turned back to his sister, a feeling of unease beginning to fill him. Of all his aides, only Stilgar dared speak to him in that tone, but even Stilgar measured the occasion by its need.\n“This one must have a mate!” Stilgar blurted. “There’ll be trouble if she’s not wed, and that soon.”\nAlia whirled away, her face suddenly hot. How did he touch me? she wondered. Bene Gesserit self-control had been powerless to prevent her reaction. How had Stilgar done that? He hadn’t the power of the Voice. She felt dismayed and angry.\n“Listen to the great Stilgar!” Alia said, keeping her back to them, aware of a shrewish quality in her voice and unable to hide it. “Advice to maidens from Stilgar, the Fremen!”\n“As | love you both, | must speak,” Stilgar said, a profound dignity in his tone. “I did not become a chieftain among the Fremen by being blind to what moves men and women together. One needs no mysterious powers for this.”\nPaul weighed Stilgar’s meaning, reviewed what they had seen here and his own undeniable male reaction to his own sister. Yes—there’d been a ruttish air about Alia, something wildly wanton. What had made her enter the practice floor in the nude? And risking her life in that foolhardy way! Eleven lights in the fencing prisms! That brainless automaton loomed in his mind with all the aspects of an ancient horror creature. Its possession was the shibboleth of this age, but it carried also the taint of old immorality. Once, they’d been guided by an artificial intelligence, computer brains. The Butlerian Jihad had ended that, but it hadn’t ended the aura of aristocratic vice which enclosed such things.\nStilgar was right, of course. They must find a mate for Alia.\n“I will see to it,” Paul said. “Alia and | will discuss this later —privately.”\nAlia turned around, focused on Paul. Knowing how his mind worked, she realized she’d been the subject of a mentat decision, uncounted bits falling together in that human-computer analysis. There was an inexorable quality to this realization—a movement like the movement of planets. It carried something of the order of the universe in it, inevitable and terrifying.\n“Sire,” Stilgar said, “perhaps we’d—”\n“Not now!” Paul snapped. “We've other problems at the moment.”\nAware that she dared not try to match logic with her brother, Alia put the past few moments aside, Bene Gesserit fashion, said: “Irulan sent you?” She found herself experiencing menace in that thought.\n“Indirectly,” Paul said. “The information she gives us confirms our suspicion that the Guild is about to try fora sSandworm.”\n“They'll try to capture a small one and attempt to start the spice cycle on some other world,” Stilgar said. “It means\nthey’ve found a world they consider suitable.”\n“It means they have Fremen accomplices!”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a Reverend Mother and Bene Gesserit adept, sister to Paul Atreides, with advanced physical and mental training.
