His birth-mother’s ties to the order establish his inherent link to them, while his role as a Bashar underscores his military leadership and strategic brilliance within their ranks. The Bene Gesserit have trained and shaped Teg, honing his abilities for their purposes, whether as a ghola—a resurrected clone under their care—or as a naturally gifted commander.  \n\nAs a key military leader, Teg is instrumental in the Bene Gesserit’s missions and training programs, demonstrating unparalleled tactical genius. His service is marked by unwavering loyalty, utilizing his unique skills to advance their cause and defend their interests.
