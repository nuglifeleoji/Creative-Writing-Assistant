{"input": [" trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n“At what time will you be expecting dinner?” she asked.\nThat’s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place—alone, the two of us, without a care.\n“I'll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late. And...ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. | want him to attend our strategy conference.”\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out,\nheaded for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately.”\nThe outer door slammed.\nJessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto’s father. It had been done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke’s middle years. He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto’s now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting.\n“Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!” she whispered.\n“What are your orders, Noble Born?”\nIt was a woman’s voice, thin and stringy.\nJessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray- haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course—that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white—secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.\nThe woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: “I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born. What are your\norders?”\n“You may refer to me as ‘my Lady,’” Jessica said. “I’m not noble born. I’m the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.”\nAgain that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning. “There’s a wife, then?”\n“There is not, nor has there ever been. | am the Duke’s only...companion, the mother of his heir- designate.”\nEven as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words. What was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Yes—/I am meeting more resistance lately. | could use a quiet retreat by myself.\nA weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: “Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo- Sook!” Then: “Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!” And again: “Soo-soo-Sook!”\n“What is that?” Jessica asked. “I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning.”\n“Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you’ve no need to interest yourself in such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it’s always kept full.” She glanced down at her dress. “Why, you know, my Lady, | don’t even have to wear my stillSuit here?” She cackled. “And me not even dead!”\nJessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more imperative.\nr\nStill, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.\n“My husband told me of your title, Shadout,” Jessica said. “I recognized the word. It’s a very ancient word.”\n“You know the ancient tongues then?” Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity.\n“Tongues are the Bene Gesserit’s first learning,” Jessica said. “I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.”\nMapes nodded. “Just as the legend says.”\nAnd Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.\n“I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,” Jessica said. She read the more obvious Signs in Mapes’ actions and appearance, the petit betrayals. “Miseces prejia,” she said in the Chakobsa tongue. “Andral t’re pera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri—”\nMapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.\n“I know many things,” Jessica said. “I know that you have borne children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. | know many things.”\nIn a low voice, Mapes said: “I meant no offense, my Lady.”\n“You speak of the legend and seek answers,” Jessica said. “Beware the answers you may find. |\nknow you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.”\n“My Lady, I....”\n“There’s a remote possibility you could draw my life’s blood,” Jessica said, “but in so doing you'd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know—even for an entire people.”\n“My Lady!” Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. “The weapon was Sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.”\n“And as the means of my death should | prove otherwise,” Jessica said. She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so terrifying in combat.\nNow we see which way the decision tips, she thought.\nSlowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk- white blade, held it up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was double-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long.\n“Do you know this, my Lady?” Mapes asked.\nIt could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor and wild gossip.\n“It’s a crysknife,” she said.\n“Say it not lightly,” Mapes said. “Do you know its meaning?”\nAnd Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here’s the reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could precipitate violence or...what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of a Knife. She’s called the Shadout in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that’s “Death Maker” in Chakobsa. She’s getting restive. | must answer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer.\nJessica said: “It’s a maker—”\n“Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!” Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room.\nJessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch.\nThe key word was...Maker.\nMaker? Maker.\nStill, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.\nJessica said: “Did you think that I, Knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the Maker?”\nMapes lowered the knife. “My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.”\nJessica thought about the prophecy—the Shari-a and all the panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long centuries ago—long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserit’s need.\nWell, that day had come.\nMapes returned knife to sheath, said: “This is an unfixed blade, my Lady. Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate. It’s yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live.”\nJessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: “Mapes, you’ve sheathed that blade unblooded.”\nWith a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica’s hand, tore open the brown bodice, wailing: “Take the water of my life!”\nJessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman. Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew a delicate scratch with the blade’s edge above Mapes’ left breast. There was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thought. A moisture- conserving mutation?\nShe sheathed the blade, said: “Button your dress, Mapes.”\nMapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites Stared at Jessica. “You are ours,” she muttered. “You\nare the One.”\nThere came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica’s bodice. “Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!” she snarled. “You know that, my Lady!”\n| know it now, Jessica thought.\nThe cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.\nMapes composed herself, said: “The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You’ve been entrusted with a crysknife.” She took a deep breath. “Now the thing must take its course. It cannot be hurried.” She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them. “And there’s work aplenty to while the time for us here.”\nJessica hesitated. “The thing must take its course.” That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva’s stock of incantations— The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.\nBut I’m not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: “What’ll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?”\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.”\nMapes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head,” she said. She stooped. “lIl have to be cleaning this first, won’t I, my Lady?”\n“No.”\n“But there’s dirt caked on its horns.”\n“That’s not dirt, Mapes. That’s the blood of our Duke’s father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after", " free you.\nBut I’m not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: “What’ll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?”\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.”\nMapes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head,” she said. She stooped. “lIl have to be cleaning this first, won’t I, my Lady?”\n“No.”\n“But there’s dirt caked on its horns.”\n“That’s not dirt, Mapes. That’s the blood of our Duke’s father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed the Old Duke.”\nMapes stood up. “Ah, now!” she said.\n“It’s just blood,” Jessica said. “Old blood at that. Get some help hanging these now. The beastly things are heavy.”\n“Did you think the blood bothered me?” Mapes asked. “I’m of the desert and I’ve seen blood aplenty.”\n“l,..see that you have,” Jessica said.\n“And some of it my own,” Mapes said. “More’n you drew with your puny scratch.”\n“You'd rather Il’d cut deeper?”\n“Ah, no! The body’s water is scant enough ‘thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air. You did the thing right.”\nAnd Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in the phrase, “the body’s water.” Again she felt a sense of oppression at the importance of water on Arrakis.\n“On which side of the dining hall shall | hang which one of these pretties, my Lady?” Mapes asked.\nEver the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: “Use your own judgment, Mapes. It\nmakes no real difference.”\n“AS you say, my Lady.” Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head. “Killed an old duke, did you?” she crooned.\n“Shall | summon a handler to help you?” Jessica asked.\n“PIL manage, my Lady.”\nYes, she'll manage, Jessica thought. There’s that about this Fremen creature: the drive to manage.\nJessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here. Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. “It cannot be hurried,” Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this place that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawat’s suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the feeling.\n“When you've finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes,” Jessica said. “One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things should go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any questions I'll be in the south wing.”\n“As you will, my Lady,” Mapes said.\nJessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe, but there’s something wrong about the place. | can feel it.\nAn urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family\nwings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.\nBehind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull’s head, looked at the retreating back. “She’s the One all right,” she muttered. “Poor thing.”\n“Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!” goes the refrain. “A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!”\n—FROM “A CHILD'S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it\ninto a room with yellow walls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases, a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right, bracketing another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs. At the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his back to her, his attention fixed upon the outside world.\nJessica took another silent step into the room.\nShe saw that Yueh’s coat was wrinkled, a white Smudge near the left elbow as though he had leaned against chalk. He looked, from behind, like a fleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy movement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block of head with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the shoulder seemed alive—turning slightly to follow some movement outside.\nAgain, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the closed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had expressed a liking.\n“Good afternoon, Dr. Yueh,” she said. “Where’s Paul?”\nHe nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner without turning: “Your son grew tired, Jessica. | sent him into the next room to rest.”\nAbruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips. “Forgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away...I...did not mean to be familiar.”\nShe smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might kneel. “Wellington, please.”\n“To use your name like that...I....\n“We've known each other six years,” she said. “It’s long past time formalities should’ve been dropped between us—in private.”\nYueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: / believe it has worked. Now, she’ll think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She'll not look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.\n“l'm afraid | was woolgathering,” he said. “Whenever I...feel especially sorry for you, I’m afraid | think of you as...well, Jessica.”\n“Sorry for me? Whatever for?”\nYueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with Jessica whenever possible. It was safest.\n“You’ve seen this place, my...Jessica.” He stumbled over the name, plunged ahead: “So barren\n”\nafter Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us.”\nShe folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm’s tooth, if the reports were right. “It’s just that we’re strange to them—different people, different customs. They’ve known only the Harkonnens.” She looked past him out the windows. “What were you staring at out there?”\nHe turned back to the window. “The people.”\nJessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the house where Yueh’s attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated them from the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the people—a house shield—and went on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.\nThe pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing people looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate...even a sense of hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.\n“Do you know what they’re thinking?” Yueh asked.\n“You profess to read minds?” she asked.\n“Those minds,” he said. “They look at those trees and they think: ‘There are one hundred of us.’ That’s what they think.”\nShe turned a puzzled frown on him. “Why?”\n“Those are date palms,” he said. “One date palm requires forty liters of water a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out there—one hundred men.”\n“But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.”\n“They but hope some dates will fall, except it’s the wrong season.”\n“We look at this place with too critical an eye,” she said. “There’s hope as well as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can make this world into whatever we wish.”\nAnd she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The laugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. “But you can’t buy security,” she said.\nYueh turned away to hide his face from her. /f only it were possible to hate these people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like his Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his purpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be dead. He had to be certain.\n“Do not worry for us, Wellington,” Jessica said. “The problem’s ours, not yours.”\nShe thinks | worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But I must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one chance to strike him where he is weakest—in his gloating moment!\nHe sighed.\n“Would it disturb Paul if | looked in on him?” she asked.\n“Not at all. | gave him a sedative.”\n“He’s taking the change well?” she asked.\n“Except for getting a bit overtired. He’s excited, but what fifteen-year-old wouldn’t be under these circumstances?” He crossed to the door, opened it. “He’s in here.”\nJessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.\nPaul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of Shadows across face and blanket.\nJessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own. But the hair was the Duke’s— coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed the lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was suddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her son’s features—her lines in eyes and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity emerging from childhood.\nShe thought of the boy’s features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns—endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh’s presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.\nYueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. / know as a doctor there was no physical reason\nagainst it. Was there some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.\nFor the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.\nJessica stopped beside him, said: “What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child.”\nHe spoke mechanically", " childhood.\nShe thought of the boy’s features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns—endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus.

The too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast—light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.\n“The sky’s so dark,” she said.\n“That’s partly the lack of moisture,” he said.\n“Water!” she snapped. “Everywhere you turn here, you’re involved with the lack of water!”\n“It’s the precious mystery of Arrakis,” he said.\n“Why is there so little of it? There’s volcanic rock here. There're a dozen power sources | could name.\nThere’s polar ice. They say you can’t drill in the desert—storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed, if the worms don’t get you first. They’ve never found water traces there, anyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that’ve been drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?”\n“First a trickle, then nothing,” he said.\n“But, Wellington, that’s the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?”\n“It is curious,” he said. “You suspect some living agency? Wouldn’t that have shown in core samples?”\n“What would have shown? Alien plant matter...or animal? Who could recognize it?” She turned back to the slope. “The water is stopped. Something plugs it. That’s my suspicion.”\n“Perhaps the reason’s known,” he said. “The Harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress this.”\n“What reason?” she asked. “And then there’s the atmospheric moisture. Little enough of it, certainly, but there’s some. It’s the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?”\n“The polar caps?”\n“Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind the Harkonnen veil that bear\nclose investigation, and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice.”\n“We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,” he said. “Perhaps we'll....” He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. “Is something wrong?”\n“The way you say ‘Harkonnen,’” she said. “Even my Duke’s voice doesn’t carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. | didn’t know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.”\nGreat Mother! he thought. /’ve aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me. There’s only one solution: tell the truth as far as | can.\nHe said: “You didn’t know that my wife, my Wanna....” He shrugged, unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: “They....” The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.\n“Forgive me,” Jessica said. “I did not mean to open an old wound.” And she thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit—the signs are all over him. And it’s obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here’s another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.\n“lam sorry,” he said. “I’m unable to talk about it.” He opened his eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.\nJessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a\nr\ncurved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over her.\n“Wellington, I’m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,” she said.\n“I came willingly,” he said. And that, too, was true.\n“But this whole planet’s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.”\n“It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,” he said. And that, too, was true.\n“Perhaps | should be more confident of him,” she said. “He is a brilliant tactician.”\n“We've been uprooted,” he said. “That’s why we're uneasy.”\n“And how easy it Is to kill the uprooted plant,” she said. “Especially when you put it down in hostile soil.”\n“Are we certain the soil’s hostile?”\n“There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was adding to the population,” She said. “They stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.”\n“There is only so much water to support human life here,” he said. “The people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn’t follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him.”\n“And guards,” she said. “Guards everywhere. And Shields. You see the blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.”\n“Give this planet a chance,” he said.\nBut Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. “I can smell death in this place,” she said. “Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There’ve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.’ She shook her head. “Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.”\n“You malign him.”\n“Malign? | praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. | just do not fool myself about Thufir’s methods.”\n“You should...keep busy,” he said. “Give yourself no time for such morbid—”\n“Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? | am the Duke’s secretary—so busy that each day | learn new things to fear...things even he doesn’t suspect | know.” She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: “Sometimes | wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.”\n“What do you mean?” He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose.\n“Don’t you think, Wellington,” she asked, “that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?”\n“That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.”\nThe rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt about his concubine. One\nr\nhad only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.\nShe sighed. “You're right. It’s not worthy.”\nAgain, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.\n“There’ll be much bloodshed soon,” she said. “The Harkonnens won't rest until they’re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood—no matter what the distance—while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin.”\n“The old feud,” Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or—worse— left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.\n“What are you thinking?” she asked.\n“Iam thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand solaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things.”\n“Does greed touch even you, Wellington?”\n“Not greed.”\n“What then?”\nHe shrugged. “Futility.” He glanced at her. “Can you remember your first taste of spice?”\n“It tasted like cinnamon.”\n“But never twice the same,” he said. “It’s like life —it presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable—slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.”\n“I think it would’ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach,” she said.\nHe saw that she hadn’t been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: Yes—why didn’t she make him do this? She could make him do virtually anything.\nHe spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: “Would you think it bold of me... Jessica, if | asked a personal question?”\nShe pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet. “Of course not. You’re...my friend.”\n“Why haven’t you made the Duke marry you?”\nShe whirled, head up, glaring. “Made him marry me? But—”\n“I should not have asked,” he said.\n“No.” She shrugged. “There’s good political reason —as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And....” She sighed. “...motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It\ndegrades everything it touches. If | made him do... this, then it would not be his doing.”\n“It’s a thing my Wanna might have said,” he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. “Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men.
