船相继登陆火星和木星的卫星，并没有引起太大的轰动，因为人们知道，这些探险的目的与以前相比既现实又明确，只是为了建立太阳系防御基地，就这个目的而言，这些以化学动力火箭和飞船为主的航行只是一个微不足道的开端。初期的探索主要集中在地球外侧行星上，但随着太空战略研究的深入，对内侧行星战略价值的忽略受到了越来越多的质疑，于是对金星和水星的探索有所加强，这也是雷迪亚兹的水星恒星型氢弹试验计划在行星防御理事会被勉强通过的原因。\n　　在水星地层中开挖试验深井是人类在太阳系其他行星上进行的第一个大型工程。由于施工只能在水星长达八十八天的夜间进行，所以工期长达三个地球年，但最后只掘进到预定深度的三分之一，再往下，出现了一种金属与岩石混合的异常坚硬的地层，继续掘进不仅进度缓慢，且耗资巨大，最后决定结束工程。如果在现有深度进行试验，地层肯定要被核爆炸掀开，形成一个大坑，这实际上是一次打了折扣的地面试验，而由于地层的干扰。对试验效果的观测比纯粹的地面试验困难许多。但雷迪亚兹想到，这个坑如果加上顶盖。也能作为基地，就仍坚持在现有深度进行地下试验。\n　　试验是在黎明时进行的，水星的日出过程长达十多小时，这时天边刚出现了微徽的亮色。\n　　起爆倒计时数到零后，有一圈圈环形的波纹以爆心投影点为圆心向外扩散，-时间水星的大地似乎变得像绸缎般柔软，紧接着，爆心处出现了一座缓缓隆起的山峰，像一个苏醒的巨人的脊背。当峰顶升至三千米左右时，整座山峰爆发开来，亿万吨的泥土和岩石飞向空中，水星的大地上长出了一束冲天的怒发！随着地层被掀起，地下核火球的光芒暴露出来，照在空中飞散的岩土上，在水星漆黑的天空中形成了壮丽的焰火。火球持续了近五分钟才熄灭，这期间，岩块纷纷在核光芒的照耀中落下。\n　　在核爆结束十多个小时后，观测者们发现水星出现了一圈星环，这是因为有相当部分的岩石在剧烈的爆炸中达到了水星的第一宇宙速度，成为了这颗行星的无数大小不一的卫星，并在轨道上散开来，使水星成为了第一个有环的类地行星。\n　　星环很细，在强烈的阳光中闲耀，像是对这颗行星的一个圈注。\n　　还有一部分岩石达到了水星的第二宇宙速度，完全脱离水星，成为太阳的卫星，在水星的太阳轨道上形成了一条极其稀疏的小行星带。\n　　雷迪亚兹是在自己居住的地下室中看到水星核试验实况转播的。其实并不是实况，画面到达地球约有七分钟的时差。当\n######################\nOutput:",
