\n　　于是，他马上回去对妻子说了他要去省城的事。秀莲一个妇道人家，她会把要卖的砖瓦数得一块不差，但对生活中如此重大的抉择，却两眼黑黑，当不了丈夫的参谋。这事只能由丈夫自己来决定。少安也知道秀莲出不了啥主意，他只是尊重她，征求她的“意见”。 \n　　妻子一放话，他便把砖瓦厂的事委托给一个可靠的师傅，就和永合一块动身去省城了。 \n　　我们姑且不评论这件事的可行与否，也不谈另有所谋的胡永合；仅就孙少安来说，这件理也暴露出初发达起来的农民的一种心态。一方面，普遍的贫困所引起的社会红眼病，使他们象传统的财主一样不愿“露富”；另一方面，自身长期社会地位的低下，又使他们不甘心寂寞无闻，产生了强烈的出人头地的欲望。两种心态都情有可原，不必指责。 \n　　需要指出的是，财富和人的素养未必同时增加。这是一个文化粗浅而素养不够的人掌握了大量的财富，某种程度上可是一件令人担心的事。同样的财富，不同修养的人就会有不同的使用；我们甚至看看欧美诸多的百万富翁就知道了这一点。毫无疑问，我国人民现在面临的主要是如何增加财富的问题。我们该让所有的人都变成令世人羡慕的大富翁。只是若干年后，我们许多人是否也将会面临一个如何支配自己财富的问题？当然，从一般意义上说，任何时候都存在着这个问题。人类史告诉我们，贫穷会引起一个社会的混乱、崩溃和革命，巨大的财富也会引起形式有别的相同的社会效应。对我们来说，也许类似的话题谈论的有些为时过早了。不过，有时候我们不得不预先把金钱和财富上升到哲学、社会学和历史的高度来认识；正如我们用同样的高度来认识我们的贫穷与落后…… \n　　我们的少安此次省城之行，准备破费自己刚积累下的那点钱去投资拍电视剧《三国演义》，最少也属于一种盲目行为。我们知道，一年前，他还在破产的泥淖中绝望地挣扎。抹不开胡永合的情面是事实。但在他本人内心深处，也不是没有一些浅薄想法——用钱买个虚名或者企图用小钱赚个大钱。他不想想，电视台的钱就那么好赚？现在有多少国营单位和一些响马式的干部，用“赞助”、“合资”一类的诱饵来套弄象他这样的一些浅薄的“万元户”！ \n　　但孙少安既然踏上了进军省城之路，心情倒很有些激动。已经到了这个地步，我们也应该公正地赞扬他的勇敢的进取精神；不管盲目还是失败，只要敢出征的将士，就应该受到敬重。 \n　　胡永合\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
