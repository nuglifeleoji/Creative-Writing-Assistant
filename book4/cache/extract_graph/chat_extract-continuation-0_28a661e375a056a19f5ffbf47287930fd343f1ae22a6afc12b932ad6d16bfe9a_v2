\n　　孙少平的这种想法是很自然的，因为与此相比较的，是他已经经历过的那些无比艰难的生活场景。 \n　　第二天上午，根据煤矿的惯例，要进行身体复查。 \n　　十点钟左右，劳资调配员带着他们上了一道小坡，穿过铁道来到西面半山腰的矿医院。 \n　　复查完全按征兵规格进行。先目测，然后看骨缝、硬伤或是否有皮肤病。有两个人立刻在骨科和皮肤科打下来了。皮肤病绝对不行，因为每天大家要在水池里共浴。少平顺利地通过一道道关口。 \n　　但是，不知为什么，他的心情渐渐紧张起来。他太珍视这次招工了，这等于是他一生命运的转折。他生怕在这最后的关头出个什么意外的事。 \n　　正如俗话所说：怕处有鬼。本来，他的身体棒极了，没一点毛病，但这无谓的紧张情绪终于导致了可怕的灾难——他在血压上被卡住了！ \n　　量血压时随着女大夫捏皮囊的响声，他的心脏象是要爆炸一般狂跳不已，结果高压竟然上了一百六十五！ \n　　全部检查完毕后，劳资调配员在医院门诊部的楼道里宣布：身体合格的下午自由安排，可以出去买东四，到矿区转一转；身体完全不合格的准备回家；血压高的人明天上午再复直一次，如果还不合格，也准备回家……回家？ \n　　这两个字使少平的头‘轰’地响了一声。此刻如果再量血压，谁知道上升到什么程度！ \n　　他两眼发黑，无数纷乱的人头连同这座楼房都一齐在他面前旋转起来。 \n　　命运啊，多么会捉弄人！他历尽磨难好不容易来到这里，怎能再回去呢？回到哪里？双水村？黄原？再到东关那个大桥头的人堆里忧愁地等待包工头来招他？ \n　　他不知道自己是怎样走回宿舍的。 \n　　孙少平躺在光床板上，头枕着那个破提包，目光呆滞地望着黑糊糊的窑顶。窑里空无一人，大家都出去转悠去了。此刻，他也再听不见外面世界的各种嘈杂，只是无比伤心地躺在这里，眼中旋转着两团泪水。他等待着明天——明天，将是决定他命运的最后一次判决。如果血压降不下来，他就得提起这个破提包，离开大牙湾……那么，他又将去哪里？ \n　　有一点是明确的：不能回家去——绝对不能。也不能回黄原去！既然已经出来了，就不能再北返一步。好马不吃回头草！如果他真的被煤矿辞退，他就去铜城谋生；揽工，掏粪，扫大街，都可以……他猛然想到，他实际上血压并不高，只是因为心情过于紧张才造成了如此后果；\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
