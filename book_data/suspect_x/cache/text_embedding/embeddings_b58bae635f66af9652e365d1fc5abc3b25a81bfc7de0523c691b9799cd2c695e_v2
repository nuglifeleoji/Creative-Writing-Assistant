{"input": [" now.\nIdaho took several deep breaths after dislodging the rock. It was a bad moment and he took the time to recover, clinging to a three-point hold on the Wall. Almost of its own accord, his free hand groped upward once more, wriggling past the rotten place into another slender crack. Slowly, he shifted his weight onto that hand. Slowly . . . slowly. His left knee felt the place where a toehold could be achieved. He lifted his foot to that place, tested it. Memory told him the top was near, but he pushed the memory aside. There was only the climb and the knowledge that Leto would arrive tomorrow.\nLeto and Hwi.\nHe could not think about that, either. But it would not go away. The top...Hwi...Leto...tomorrow...\nEvery thought fed his desperation, forced him into the immediate remembrance of the climbs of his childhood. The more he remembered consciously, the more his abilities were blocked. He was forced to pause, breathing deeply in the attempt to center himself, to go back to the natural ways of his past.\nBut were those ways natural?\nThere was a blockage in his mind. He could sense intrusions, a finality .. . the fatality of what might have been and now would never be.\nLeto would arrive up there tomorrow.\nIdaho felt perspiration run down his face around the place where he pressed a cheek against the rock.\nLeto.\n/ will defeat you, Leto. | will defeat you for myself, not for Hwi, but only for myself.\nA sensation of cleansing began to spread through him. It was like the thing which had happened in the night while he prepared himself mentally for this climb. Siona had sensed his sleeplessness. She had begun to talk to him, telling him the smallest details of her desperate run through the Forbidden Forest and her oath at the edge of the river.\n“Now I have given an oath to command his Fish Speakers,” she said. “I will honor that oath, but | hope it will not happen in the way he wants.”\n“What does he want?” Idaho asked.\n“He has many motives and | cannot see them all. Who could possibly understand him? | only know that | will never forgive him.”\nThis memory brought Idaho back to the sensation of the Wall’s rock against his cheek. His perspiration had dried in the light breeze and he felt chilled. But he had found his center.\nNever forgive.\nIdaho felt the ghosts of all his other selves, the gholas who had died in Leto’s service. Could he believe Siona’s suspicions? Yes. Leto was capable of killing with his own body, his own hands. The rumor which Siona recounted had a feeling of truth in it. And Siona, too, was Atreides. Leto had become something else . . . no longer Atreides, not even human. He had become not so much a living creature as a brute fact of nature, opaque and impenetrable, all of\nhis experiences sealed off within him. And Siona opposed him. The real Atreides turned away from him.\nAs I do.\nA brute fact of nature, nothing more. Just like this Wall.\nIdaho’s right hand groped upward and found a sharp ledge. He could feel nothing above the ledge and tried to remember a wide crack at this place in the pattern. He could not dare to allow himself into the belief that he had reached the top ... not yet. The sharp edge cut into his fingers as he put his weight on it. He brought his left hand up to that level, found a purchase and pulled himself slowly upward. His eyes reached the level of his hands. He stared across a flat space which reached outward... outward into blue sky. The surface where his hands clutched showed ancient weather cracks. He crawled his fingers across that surface, one hand at a time, seeking out the cracks, dragging his chest up... his waist... his hips. He rolled then, twisting and crawling until the Wall was far behind him. Only then did he stand and tell himself what his senses reported.\nThe top. And he had not required pitons or hammer.\nA faint sound reached him. Cheering?\nHe walked back to the edge and looked down, waving to them. Yes, they were cheering. Turning back, he strode to the center of the roadway, letting elation still the trembling of his muscles, soothe the aching of his shoulders. Slowly, he turned full circle, examining the top while he let his memories at last estimate the height of that climb.\nNine hundred meters... at least that.\nThe Royal Roadway interested him. It was not like what he had seen on the way to Onn. It was wide, wide... at least five hundred meters. The roadbed was a smooth, unbroken gray with its edge some one hundred meters from each lip of the Wall. Rock pillars at man height marked the road’s edge, stretching away like sentinels along the path Leto would use.\nIdaho walked to the far side of the Wall opposite the Sareer and peered down. Far away in the depths, a hurtling green flow of river battered itself into foam against buttress rocks. He looked to the right. Leto would come from there. Road and Wall curved gently to the right, the curve beginning about three hundred meters from the place where Idaho stood. Idaho returned to the road and walked along its edge, following the curve until it made a returning “S” and narrowed, sloping gently downward. He stopped and looked at what was revealed for him, seeing the new pattern take shape.\nAbout three kilometers away down the gentle slope, the roadway narrowed and crossed the river gorge on a bridge whose faery trusses appeared insubstantial and toylike at this distance. Idaho remembered a similar bridge on the road to Onn, the substantial feel of it beneath his feet. He trusted his memory, thinking about bridges as a military leader was forced to think about the m—passages or traps.\nMoving out to his left, he looked down and outward to another high Wall at the far anchor of the faery bridge. The road continued there, turning gently until it was a line running straight northward. There were two Walls along there and the river between them. The river glided in a man-made chasm, its moisture confined and channeled into a northward wind-drift while the water itself flowed southward.\nIdaho ignored the river then. It was there and it would be there tomorrow. He fixed his attention on the bridge, letting his military training examine it. He nodded once to himself before turning back the way he had come, lifting the light rope from his shoulders as he walked.\nIt was only when she saw the rope come snaking down that Nayla had her orgasm.\nWhat am | eliminating? The bourgeois infatuation with peaceful conservation of the past. This is a binding force, a thing which holds humankind into one vulnerable unit in spite of illusionary separations across parsecs of space. If | can find the scattered bits, others can find them. When you are together, you can share a common catastrophe. You can be exterminated together. Thus, | demonstrate the terrible danger of a gliding, passionless mediocrity, a movement without ambitions or aims. | show you that entire civilizations can do this thing. | give you eons of life which slips gently toward death without fuss or stirring, without even asking “Why?” | show you the false happiness and the shadow-catastrophe called Leto, the God Emperor. Now, will you learn the real happiness?\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nH aving spent the night with only one brief catnap, Leto was awake when Moneo emerged from the guest house at dawn. The Royal Cart had been parked almost in the center of a three-sided courtyard. The cart’s cover had been set on one-way Opaque, concealing its occupant, and was tightly sealed against moisture. Leto could hear the faint stirring of the fans which pulsed his air through a drying cycle.\nMoneo’s feet scratched on the courtyard’s cobbles as he approached the cart. Dawnlight edged the guest house roof with orange above the majordomo.\nLeto opened the cart’s cover as Moneo stopped in front of him. There was a yeasting dirt smell to the air and the accumulation of moisture in the breeze was painful.\n“We should arrive at Tuono about noon,” Moneo said. “l wish you'd let me bring in ‘thopters to guard the sky.”\n“I do not want 'thopters,” Leto said. “We can go down to Tuono on suspensors and ropes.”\nLeto marveled at the plastic images in this brief exchange. Moneo had never liked peregrinations. His youth\nas a rebel had left him with suspicions of everything he could not see or label. He remained a mass of latent judgments.\n“You know | don’t want ‘thopters for transport,” Moneo said. “I want them to guard...”\n“Yes, Moneo.”\nMoneo looked past Leto at the open end of the courtyard which overlooked the river canyon. Dawnlight was frosting the mist which arose from the depths. He thought of how far down that canyon dropped... a body twisting, twisting as it fell. Moneo had found himself unable to go to the canyon’s lip last night and peer down into it. The drop was sucha... such a temptation.\nWith that insightful power which filled Moneo with such awe, Leto said: “There’s a lesson in every temptation, Moneo.”\nSpeechless, Moneo turned to stare directly into Leto’s eyes.\n“See the lesson in my life, Moneo.”\n“Lord?” It was only a whisper.\n“They tempt me first with evil, then with good. Each temptation is fashioned with exquisite attention to my susceptibilities. Tell me, Moneo, if | choose the good, does that make me good?”\n“Of course it does, Lord.”\n“Perhaps you will never lose the habit of judgment,” Leto said.\nMoneo looked away from him once more and stared at the chasm’s edge. Leto rolled his body to look where Moneo looked. Dwarf pines had been cultured along the lip of the canyon. There were hanging dewdrops on the damp needles, each of them sending a promise of pain to Leto. He longed to close the cart’s cover, but there was an immediacy in those jewels which attracted his memories even while they repelled his body. The opposed synchrony threatened to fill him with turmoil.\n“I just don’t like going around on foot,” Moneo said.\n“It was the Fremen way,” Leto said.\nMoneo sighed. “The others will be ready in a few minutes. Hwi was breakfasting when | came out.”\nLeto did not respond. His thoughts were lost in memories of night—the one just past and the millennial others which crowded his pasts—clouds and stars, the rains and the open blackness pocked with glittering flakes from a shredded cosmos, a universe of nights, extravagant with them as he had been with his heartbeats.\nMoneo suddenly demanded: “Where are your guards?”\n“I sent them to eat.”\n“I don’t like them leaving you unguarded!”\nThe crystal sound of Moneo’s voice rang in Leto’s memories, speaking things not cast in words. Moneo feared a universe where there was no God Emperor. He would rather die than see such a universe.\n“What will happen today?” Moneo demanded.\nIt was a question directed not to the God Emperior but to the prophet.\n“A seed blown on the wind could be tomorrow’s willow tree,” Leto said.\n“You know our future! Why won’t you share it?” Moneo was close to hysteria. . . refusing anything his immediate senses did not report.\nLeto turned", " his pasts—clouds and stars, the rains and the open blackness pocked with glittering flakes from a shredded cosmos, a universe of nights, extravagant with them as he had been with his heartbeats.\nMoneo suddenly demanded: “Where are your guards?”\n“I sent them to eat.”\n“I don’t like them leaving you unguarded!”\nThe crystal sound of Moneo’s voice rang in Leto’s memories, speaking things not cast in words.

Why won’t you share it?” Moneo was close to hysteria. . . refusing anything his immediate senses did not report.\nLeto turned to glare at the majordomo, a gaze so obviously filled with pent-up emotions that Moneo recoiled from it.\n“Take charge of your own existence, Moneo!”\nMoneo took a deep, trembling breath. “Lord, | meant no offense. | sought only...”\n“Look upward, Moneo!”\nInvoluntarily, Moneo obeyed, peering into the cloudless sky where morning light was increasing. “What is it, Lord?”\n“There’s no reassuring ceiling over you, Moneo. Only an open sky full of changes. Welcome it. Every sense you\npossess is an instrument for reacting to change. Does that tell you nothing?”\n“Lord, | only came out to inquire when you would be ready to proceed.”\n“Moneo, | beg you to be truthful with me.”\n“lam truthful, Lord!”\n“But if you live in bad faith, lies will appear to you like the truth.”\n“Lord, if I lie... then I| do not know it.”\n“That has the ring of truth. But | know what you dread and will not speak.”\nMoneo began to tremble. The God Emperor was in the most terrible of moods, a deep threat in every word.\n“You dread the imperialism of consciousness,” Leto said, “and you are right to fear it. Send Hwi out here immediately!”\nMoneo whirled and fled back into the guest house. It was as though his entrance stirred up an insect colony. Within seconds, Fish Speakers emerged and spread around the Royal Cart. Courtiers peered from the guest house windows or came out and stood under deep eaves, afraid to approach him. In contrast to this excitement, Hwi emerged presently from the wide central doorway and strode out of the shadows, moving slowly toward Leto, her chin up, her gaze seeking his face.\nLeto felt himself becoming calm as he looked at her. She wore a golden gown he had not seen before. It had been piped with silver and jade at the neck and the cuffs of its long sleeves. The hem, almost dragging on the ground, had heavy green braid to outline deep red crenelations.\nHwi smiled as she stopped in front of him.\n“Good morning, Love.” She spoke softly. “What have you done to get poor Moneo so upset?”\nSoothed by her presence and her voice, he smiled. “I did what | always hope to do. | produced an effect.”\n“You certainly did. He told the Fish Speakers you were in an angry and terrifying mood. Are you terrifying, Love?”\n“Only to those who refuse to live by their own strengths.”\n“Ahhh, yes.” She pirouetted for him then, displaying her new gown. “Do you like it? Your Fish Speakers gave it to me. They decorated it themselves.”\n“My love,” he said, a warning note in his voice, “decoration! That is how you prepare the sacrifice.”\nShe came up to the edge of the cart and leaned on it just below his face, a mock solemn expression on her lips. “Will they sacrifice me, then?”\n“Some of them would like to.”\n“But you will not permit it.”\n“Our fates are joined,” he said.\n“Then I shall not fear.” She reached up and touched one of his silver-skinned hands, but jerked away as his fingers began to tremble.\n“Forgive me, Love. | forget that we are joined in soul and not in flesh,” she said.\nThe sandtrout skin still shuddered from Hwi’s touch. “Moisture in the air makes me overly sensitive,” he said. Slowly, the shuddering subsided.\n“| refuse to regret what cannot be,” she whispered.\n“Be strong, Hwi, for your soul is mine.”\nShe turned at a sound from the guest house. “Moneo returns,” she said. “Please, Love, do not frighten him.”\n“Is Moneo your friend, too?”\n“We are friends of the stomach. We both like yogurt.”\nLeto was still chuckling when Moneo stopped beside Hwi. Moneo ventured a smile, casting a puzzled glance at Hwi. There was gratitude in the majordomo’s manner and some of the subservience he was accustomed to show to Leto he now directed at Hwi. “Is it well with you, Lady Hwi?”\n“It is well with me.”\nLeto said: “In the time of the stomach, friendships of the stomach are to be nurtured and cultivated. Let us be on our\nway, Moneo. Tuono awaits.”\nMoneo turned and shouted orders to the Fish Speakers and courtiers.\nLeto grinned at Hwi. “Do | not play the impatient bridegroom with a certain style?”\nShe leaped lightly up to the bed of his cart, her skirt gathered in one hand. He unfolded her seat. Only when she was Seated, her eyes level with Leto’s, did she respond, and then it was in a voice pitched for his ears alone.\n“Love of my soul, | have captured another of your secrets.”\n“Release it from your lips,” he said, joking in this new intimacy between them.\n“You seldom need words,” she said. “You speak directly to the senses with your own life.”\nA shudder flexed its way through the length of his body. It was a moment before he could speak and then it was ina voice she had to strain to hear above the hubbub of the assembling cortege.\n“Between the superhuman and the inhuman,” he said, “l have had little space in which to be human. I thank you, gentle and lovely Hwi, for this little space.”\nIn all of my universe | have seen no /aw of nature, unchanging and inexorable. This universe presents only changing relationships which are sometimes seen as laws by short-lived awareness. These fleshly sensoria which we call se/fare ephemera withering in the blaze of infinity, fleetingly aware of temporary conditions which confine our activities and change as our activities change. If you must label the absolute, use its proper name: Temporary.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nN ayla was the first to glimpse the approaching cortege. Perspiring heavily in the midday heat, she stood near one of the rock pillars which marked the edges of the Royal Road. A sudden flash of distant reflection caught her attention. She peered in that direction, squinting, realizing with a thrill of awareness that she saw sun-dazzle on the cover of the God Emperor’s cart.\n“They come!” she called.\nShe felt hunger then. In their excitement and singleness of purpose, none of them had brought food. Only the Fremen had brought water and that because “Fremen always carry water when they leave sietch.” They did it by rote.\nNayla touched one finger to the butt of the lasgun holstered at her hip. The bridge lay no more than twenty meters ahead of her, its faery structure arching across the chasm like an alien fantasy joining one barren surface to another.\nThis is madness, she thought.\nBut the God Emperor had reinforced his command. He required his Nayla to obey Siona in all things.\nSiona’s orders were explicit, leaving no way for evasions. And Nayla had no way here to query her God Emperor. Siona\nhad said: “When his cart is in the middle of the bridge— then!”\n“But why?”\nThey had been standing well away from the others in the chill dawn atop the barrier Wall, Nayla feeling precariously isolated here, remote and vulnerable.\nSiona’s grim features, her low, intense voice, could not be denied. “Do you think you can harm God?”\n“I...” Nayla could only shrug.\n“You must obey me!”\n“I must,” Nayla agreed.\nNayla studied the approach of the distant cortege, noting the colors of the courtiers, the thick masses of blue marking her sisters of the Fish Speakers... the shiny surface of her Lord’s cart.\nIt was another test, she decided. The God Emperor would know. He would know the devotion in His Nayla’s heart. It was a test. The God Emperor’s commands must be obeyed in all things. That was the earliest lesson of her Fish Speaker childhood. The God Emperor had said that Nayla must obey Siona. It was a test. What else could it be?\nShe looked toward the four Fremen. They had been positioned by Duncan Idaho directly in the roadway and blocking part of the exit from this end of the bridge. They sat with their backs to her and looked out across the bridge, four brown-robed mounds. Nayla had heard Idaho’s words to them.\n“Do not leave this place. You must greet him from here. Stand when he nears you and bow low.”\nGreet, yes.\nNayla nodded to herself.\nThe three other Fish Speakers who had climbed the Barrier Wall with her had been sent to the center of the bridge. All they knew was what Siona had told them in Nayla’s presence. They were to wait until the Royal Cart was only a few paces from them, then they were to turn and\ndance away from the cart, leading it and the procession toward the vantage point above Tuono.\nIf | cut the bridge with my lasgun, those three will die, Nayla thought. And all the others who come with our Lord.\nNayla craned her neck to peer down into the gorge. She could not see the river from here, but she could hear its distant rumblings, a movement of rocks.\nThey would all die!\nUnless He performs a Miracle.\nThat had to be it. Siona had set the stage for a Holy Miracle. What else could Siona intend now that she had been tested, now that she wore the uniform of Fish Speaker Command? Siona had given her oath to the God Emperor. She had been tested by God, the two of them alone in the Sareer.\nNayla turned only her eyes to the right, peering at the architects of this greeting. Siona and Idaho stood shoulder- to-shoulder in the roadway about twenty meters to Nayla’s right. They were deep in conversation, looking at each other occasionally, nodding.\nPresently, Idaho touched Siona’s arm—an oddly possessive gesture. He nodded once and strode off toward the bridge, stopping at the buttress corner directly in front of Nayla. He peered down, then crossed to the other near corner of the bridge. Again, he peered downward, standing there for several minutes before returning to Siona.\nWhat a strange creature, that ghola, Nayla thought. After that awesome climb, she no longer thought of him as quite human. He was something else, a demiurge who stood next to God. But he could breed.\nA distant shout caught Nayla’s attention.", " God, the two of them alone in the Sareer.\nNayla turned only her eyes to the right, peering at the architects of this greeting.

After that awesome climb, she no longer thought of him as quite human. He was something else, a demiurge who stood next to God. But he could breed.\nA distant shout caught Nayla’s attention. She turned and looked across the bridge. The cortege had been in the familiar trot of a royal peregrination. Now, they were slowing to a sedate walk only a few minutes away from the bridge. Nayla recognized Moneo marching in the van, his uniform brilliant white, the even, undeviating stride with his gaze\nstraight ahead. The cover of the Emperor’s cart had been sealed. It glittered in mirror-opacity as it rolled behind Moneo on its wheels.\nThe mystery of it all filled Nayla.\nA miracle was about to happen!\nNayla glanced to the right at Siona. Siona returned her gaze and nodded once. Nayla drew the lasgun from its holster and rested it against the rock pillar as she sighted along it. The cable on the left first, then the cable on the right, then the faery trellis of plasteel on the left. The lasgun felt cold and alien against Nayla’s hand. She took a trembling breath to restore calm.\nI must obey. It is a test.\nShe saw Moneo lift his gaze from the roadway and, not changing stride, turn to shout something at the cart or the ones behind it. Nayla could not make out the words. Moneo faced front once more. Nayla steadied herself, a part of the rock pillar which concealed most of her body.\nA test.\nMoneo had seen the people on the bridge and at the far end. He identified Fish Speaker uniforms and his first thought was to wonder who had ordered these greeters. He turned and shouted a question at Leto, but the God Emperor’s cart cover remained opaque, hiding Hwi and Leto within it.\nMoneo was onto the bridge, the cart rasping in blown sand behind him, before he recognized Siona and Idaho standing well back from the far end. He identified four Museum Fremen seated on the roadway. Doubts began squirming through Moneo’s mind, but he could not change the pattern. He ventured a glance down at the river—a platinum world there caught in the noonday light. The sound of the cart was loud behind him. The flow of the river, the flow of the cortege, the sweeping importance of these things in which he played a role—all of it caught up his mind in a dizzying sensation of the inevitable.\nWe are not people passing this way, he thought. We are primal elements linking one piece of Time to another. And when we have passed, everything behind us will drop off into no-sound, a place like the no-room of the Ixians, yet never again the same as it was before we came.\nA bit from one of the lute-player’s songs wafted through Moneo’s memory and his eyes went out of focus in the remembrance. He knew that song for its wishfulness, a wish that all of this were ended, all past, all doubts banished, tranquility returned. The plaintive song drifted through his awareness like smoke, twisting and compelling:\n“Insect cries in roots of pampas grass.”\nMoneo hummed the song to himself:\n“Insect cries mark the end. Autumn and my song are the color Of the last leaves\nIn roots of pampas grass.”\nMoneo nodded his head to the refrain:\n“Day is ended, Visitors gone.\nDay is ended.\nIn our Sietch,\nDay is ended. Storm wind sounds. Day is ended. Visitors gone.”\nMoneo decided that the lute-player’s song had to be a really old one, an Old Fremen song, no doubt of it. And it told him something about himself. He wished the visitors truly gone, the excitements ended, peace once more. Peace was so near... yet he could not leave his duties. He thought of all that impedimenta piled out there on the sand\njust beyond visibility range from Tuono. They would see it all soon—tents, food, tables, golden plates and jeweled knives, glowglobes fashioned in the arabesque shapes of ancient lamps... everything rich and full of expectations from completely different lives.\nThey will never be the same in Tuono.\nMoneo had spent two nights in Tuono once on an inspection tour. He remembered the smells of their cooking fires—aromatic bushes kindled and flaming in the dark. They would not use sunstoves because “that is not the most ancient way.”\nMost ancient!\nThere was little smell of melange in Tuono. A sweet acridity and the musky oils of oasis shrubs, these dominated the odors. Yes ... and the cesspools and the stink of rotting garbage. He recalled the God Emperor’s comment when Moneo had finished reporting on that tour.\n“These Fremen do not know what is lost from their lives. They think they keep the essence of the old ways. This is a failure of all museums. Something fades; it dries out of the exhibits and is gone. The people who administer the museum and the people who come to bend over the cases and stare—few of them sense this missing thing. It drove the engine of life in earlier times. When the life is gone, it is gone.”\nMoneo focused on the three Fish Speakers who stood just ahead of him on the bridge. They lifted their arms high and began to dance, whirling and skipping away from him only a few paces distant.\nHow odd, he thought. /’ve seen the other people dance in the open, but never Fish Speakers. They only dance in the privacy of their quarters, in the intimacy of their own company.\nThis thought was still in his mind when he heard the first awful humming of the lasgun and felt the bridge lurch beneath him.\nThis is not happening, his mind told him.\nHe heard the Royal Cart scrape sideways across the roadbed, then the snap-si/ap of the cart’s cover slamming open. A bedlam of screams and cries arose from behind him, but he could not turn. The bridge’s roadbed had tipped steeply to Moneo’s right, spilling him onto his face while he went sliding toward the abyss. He clutched a severed strand of cable to stop himself. The cable went with him, everything grating in the spilling film of sand which had covered the roadbed. He clutched the cable with both hands, turning with it. He saw the Royal Cart then. It skewed sideways toward the edge of the bridge, its cover open. Hwi stood there, one hand steadying her on the folding seat while she stared past Moneo.\nA horrible screaming of metal filled the air as the roadbed tipped even farther. He saw people from the cortege falling, their mouths open, arms waving. Something had caught Moneo’s cable. His arms were stretched out over his head as he turned once more, twisting. He felt his hands, greased by the perspiration of fear, slipping along the cable.\nOnce more, his gaze came around to the Royal Cart. It lay jammed against the stubs of broken girders. Even as Moneo looked, the God Emperor’s futile hands groped for Hwi Noree, but failed to reach her. She fell from the cart’s open end, silently, the golden gown whipping upward to reveal her body stretched out as straight as an arrow.\nA deep, rumbling groan came from the God Emperor.\nWhy doesn’t he activate the suspensors? Moneo wondered. The suspensors will support him.\nBut the lasgun was still humming and, as Moneo’s hands Slipped from the cable’s severed end, he saw lancing flame strike the cart’s suspensor bubbles, piercing one after another in eruptions of golden smoke. Moneo stretched his hands over his head as he fell.\nThe smoke! The golden smoke!\nHis robe whipped upward, turning him until his face was directed downward into the abyss. With his gaze on the depths, he recognized a maelstrom of boiling rapids there, the mirror of his life—precipitous currents and plunges, all movement gathering up all substance. Leto’s words wound through his mind on a path of golden smoke: “Caution is the path to mediocrity. Gliding, passionless mediocrity is all that most people think they can achieve.” Moneo fell freely then in the ecstasy of awareness. The universe opened for him like clear glass, everything flowing in a no-Time.\nThe golden smoke!\n“Leto!” he screamed. “Siaynoq! | believe!”\nThe robe tore away from his shoulders then. He turned in the wind of the canyon—one last glimpse of the Royal Cart tipping .. . tipping from the shattered roadbed. The God Emperor slid out of the open end.\nSomething solid smashed into Moneo’s back—his last sensation.\nLeto felt himself sliding from the cart. His awareness held only the image of Hwi striking the river—the distant pearly fountain which marked her plunge into the myths and dreams of termination. Her last words, calm and steady, rolled through all of his memories: “I shall go on ahead, Love.”\nAs he slipped from the cart, he saw the scimitar arc of the river, a silver-edged thing which shimmered in its mottled shadows, a vicious blade of a river honed through Eternity and ready now to receive him into its agony.\n| cannot cry, nor even shout, he thought. Tears are no longer possible. They're water. l'Il have water enough in a moment. | can only moan in my grief. | am alone, more alone than ever before.\nHis great ridged body flexed as it fell, twisting him about until his amplified vision revealed Siona standing at the broken brink of the bridge.\nNow, you will learn! he thought.\nThe body continued to turn. He watched the river approach. The water was a dream inhabited by glimpses of fish which ignited an ancient memory of a banquet beside a granite pool—pink flesh dazzling his hungers.\n/ join you, Hwi, in the banquet of the gods!\nA bursting flash of bubbles enclosed him in agony. Water, vicious currents of it, buffeted him all around. He felt the gnashing of rocks as he struggled upward to broach ina torrential cascade, his body flexing in a paroxysm of involuntary, writhing splashes. The canyon Wall, wet and black, sped past his frantic gaze. Shattered spangles of what had been his skin exploded away from him, a rain of silver all around him darting away into the river, a ring of dazzling movement, brittle sequins—the scale-glitter of sandtrout leaving him to begin their own colony lives.\nThe agony continued. Leto marveled that he could remain conscious, that he had a body to feel.\nInstinct drove him. He clutched at a rock around which the torrent spilled him, felt a clutching finger torn from his hand before he could release his grip.
