Spanning from 201 B.G. to 108 B.G., this crusade sought to eradicate machines that simulated human minds, driven by a desire to preserve human autonomy, essence, and judgment. The Jihad's aftermath led to the strict prohibition of such technologies, profoundly shaping the technological, ethical, and religious landscape of the universe.  \n\nThe conflict destroyed artificial intelligence and machine-logic, replacing them with human-centric governance and mental disciplines. Institutions like the **Bene Gesserit** and the **Spacing Guild** emerged, relying on human mental training (e.g., mentats) rather than machines. The Bene Gesserit, in particular, maintained knowledge through their Archives, avoiding reliance on prohibited technologies. The Jihad's prohibitions were later upheld by figures like **Leto II**, despite his nuanced relationship with technology.  \n\nCulturally, the Jihad influenced feudal structures within the **Imperium**, reinforced religious taboos against thinking machines, and spurred ethical dilemmas about technology. References to the event often highlight its role in banning devices like the **Ixian memocorder** and its impact on mob motivations and societal fears. Though some descriptions emphasize its destructive nature (e.g., destroyed libraries), others frame it as a necessary rebellion that ensured human dominance.  \n\nUltimately, the Butlerian Jihad was a defining historical upheaval that reshaped civilization, enforcing the mantra: **\"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.\"** Its legacy endured for millennia, dictating technological limits and human reliance on innate abilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754986014, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 751, "total_tokens": 1104, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 687}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
