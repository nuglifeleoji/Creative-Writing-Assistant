有点忧伤地说：“……唉！我们也应该请秀莲和你到我们家吃一顿饭，这是老乡俗……可你知道我家里的那个烂滩场！夏天分的一点麦子都叫你二妈在石圪节粮站换成了粮票，说公社通知让她下一批去参观大寨……” \n　　少安听他说这话，心里倒对这个他厌烦的长辈产生了怜悯之情。他以为二爸只热心革命，把人情世故都忘了。想不到他还记着这个乡规。 \n　　少安也知道他二爸说的是实情。他对二爸说：“我知道你的难处。按乡俗，你不请秀莲吃饭，村里人会笑话的……这样吧，我把我家的白面拿一升，给你送过去。白天怕村里人看见不好，我今晚上给你送过去……” \n　　这位硒惶的“革命家”只好默认了侄儿的馈赠。孙少安离开他二爸，就径直来到了金俊武家里。 \n　　二队长拉住一队长的手，泪水在那双精明的铜铃般的大眼里涌出来了。 \n　　少安安慰他说：“俊武哥，你不要再难过了。我刚回来就知道了这事。我今个儿是专门来为你说几句宽心话的。人常说，一碗水倒在地上，再也舀不起来了。”他还用高小里学过的成语补充说：“天有不测风云，人有旦夕祸福……” \n　　俊武拉着他的手，让他坐在椅子上。俊武的婆姨给少安倒了一杯开水，亲切地放在他面前。两口子都为村里这个受人尊重的人专门来看望他们而深受感动。 \n　　少安喝了一口水说：“我不知道你们当时是怎样商量这事的？本来不应该这样做！应该直接找公社白主任讨论东拉河水合理分配的问题，让公社出面解决。另外，就是公社不管，田福堂或金俊山也可以直接去找上游几个村的负责人协商。只要态度诚恳，我不信这两个村的领导人就不通情理。结果这样一搞，水空人亡，还要给人家做检讨……”金俊武抹掉脸上的泪水说：“你当时要在村里就好了！我原来以为自己是个精明人，想不到自己吃了自己精明的亏。我在大事上不如你！” \n　　金俊武老婆插嘴说：“你在小事上也不如人家少安！”少安笑着说：“我也是事后诸葛亮！说不定我当时要在村里，比谁都可能冒失哩！说不定把下山村的坝都给豁了！”金俊武两口子都被他的话逗笑了……少安在金俊武家拉了一阵话，就和他们告别了。 \n　　当他返回到田家圪崂这面的公路上时，正好碰上了田福堂。他就顺便挡住书记给他解释了他从山西晚回来的事由。 \n　　田福堂经过不久前，那场挫折，又瘦了许多，额头上还留着火罐拔下的黑印。他笑着说：“这是好事嘛！还要你给我解释哩？你办这么大的事，别说一个月，两个月三个月也值得！” \n　　田福堂心里十\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
