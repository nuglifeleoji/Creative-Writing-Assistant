Although there is a mention of **桐原洋介 (Kirihara Yosuke)**'s funeral taking place, the primary focus of the descriptions is on **唐泽礼子**'s funeral, which is either in the preparation stage or already underway. The details suggest that **雪穗** plays a central role in the proceedings, overseeing the arrangements and attending to guests.  \n\nTo resolve any contradictions: while **桐原洋介**'s funeral is noted as occurring, the majority of the information pertains to **唐泽礼子**'s funeral, with **雪穗** as the key figure managing the event. Thus, the primary subject is **唐泽礼子**'s funeral, with **雪穗** as the organizer and host. Any reference to **桐原洋介**'s funeral appears to be incidental or concurrent but unrelated to the main event.  \n\nIn summary, the funeral is primarily for **唐泽礼子**, organized by **雪穗**, who is actively involved in receiving mourners. The mention of **桐原洋介**'s funeral does not alter the central focus on **唐泽礼子**'s service.\",5\n498,桐原父亲的命案,\"桐原的父亲被杀害的事件，警方曾多次调查松浦、桐原亮和他母亲的不在场证明。\"\"\",4\n494,当铺,\"The **当铺** (Pawnshop) is a shop that appears to be permanently closed, with its doors shut and an atmosphere resembling ruins.
