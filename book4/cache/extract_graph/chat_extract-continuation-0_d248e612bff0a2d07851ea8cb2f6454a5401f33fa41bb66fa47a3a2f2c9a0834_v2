�晓霞找到这里的时候，少平正在工地上拉水泥板。他光着身子，只穿一件短裤，被太阳晒黑的身子流着肮脏的汗泥道。这副样子站在穿着裙子、打扮得花枝招展的晓霞面前，使他感到十分窘迫。他赶忙把那件比身体还脏的汗衫套在身上。 \n　　很长一段时间了，他一直没和晓霞见过面。现在她猛然出现在面前，倒使他十分激动。 \n　　旁边那些赤身裸体的工匠眼馋地看着他和一个漂亮姑娘说话，都忍不住说出一些酸溜的“黑话”来。象上次一样，少平既有点不好意思，但又感到很骄傲！ \n　　晓霞按捺不住自己的兴奋，先赶快把她分配到省报当记者的事告诉了他。 \n　　记者？对孙少平来说，这是记者田晓霞向他报道的第一条新闻——一条让他震惊的新闻！ \n　　他那激动的情绪刹那间消失了，随之而来的几乎是一种无声的哽咽。是的，她要远走高飞了。他再一次认识到，即使她和他近在咫尺，可他们之间相隔的距离却永远是那么遥远。 \n　　“你能不能请半天假，咱们一块出去玩一玩？”晓霞很快看出她自己的好消息在朋友那里引起了什么样的反响，于是赶快转了话题。 \n　　“行！”孙少平立刻爽快地说。事到如今，他感到他很快就要和晓霞天各一方了，因此也很想再和她在一块呆一段时光。他痛切地感到，一种最美好的东西从此将要永远地从他身边流逝。是的，流逝。 \n　　“你先在这儿等一下，让我去换换衣服！”他说着就走过去向站场的工头请了假，然后两条腿象抽了筋似地跑回到他住的地方。 \n　　他先在楼下水龙头上冲了冲身子，便回到房间换了身干净的衣服，用手指头匆忙地梳理了一下蓬乱的头发，就又跑回来了。他没忘记带了二十元钱——他要请晓霞在街上的饭馆吃一顿饭，以庆贺她到省报去当记者……他们在梧桐树和汉槐洒下的浓密荫凉中，相跟着从南关的大街上走过来。 \n　　在影剧院附近，满怀激情的孙少平，潇洒地把晓霞带进了黄原最好的一家饭馆。这时候，谁也不会看出来他是个半小时前还满身黑汗的揽工小子。 \n　　少平让晓霞坐着，自己跑前跑后，买了四菜一汤，并且提来两瓶青岛啤酒。 \n　　晓霞今天象个乖孩子似的坐在凳子上，眼睛一刻也没有离开走动着的少平。她感到自己的眼窝有点热。她第一次这样安心地坐在饭馆里，让一个男人花钱为她买酒买菜。她长大后从来没有感到过心情\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
