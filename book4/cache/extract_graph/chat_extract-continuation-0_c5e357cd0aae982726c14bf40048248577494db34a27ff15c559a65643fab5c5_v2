\n　　少安拉金波兄妹俩到他家去吃饭——因为今天杀猪，按规矩要招待杀猪匠一顿，全家今天中午吃猪下水小米干饭。但两个懂事娃娃死活不去，硬从少安手里挣脱开来，跑回自己家里了。 \n　　孙少安只好把灶里的火加旺，然后锁住门回家去吃饭。 \n　　吃完午饭后，他随即带了几十块钱，就又起身去石圪节街上买些待客的烟酒。事真多！ \n　　他背着个钱褡裢，也没借别人的自行车，一个人一边抽着旱烟卷，一边不慌不忙在公路上步行往石圪节走。这季节，寒冬的山野显得荒凉而又寂寞。山上的沟道，赤裸裸地再也没什么遮掩。黄土地冻得象石板一样坚硬。远处的山坡上，偶尔有一拢高粱杆，被风吹得零零乱乱铺在地上——这大概是那些没有劳力的干部家属的。山野和河边上的树木全部掉光了叶子，在寒风中孤零零地站立着。植物的种子深埋在土地下，做着悠长的冬日的梦。地面上，一群群乌鸦飞来飞去，寻觅遗漏的颗粒，“呱呱”的叫声充满了凄凉……东拉河已经被坚冰封盖得严严实实，冰面蒙了一层灰漠漠的尘土。河两岸的草坡上，到处都留下顽皮孩子们烧荒的痕迹——一片斑黄，一片枯黑。天气虽然晴晴朗朗，但并不暖和。太阳似乎离地球越来越远，再也不能给人间一丝的温暖了。 \n　　孙少安背着钱褡裢，筒着双手，在公路上慢慢走着。为了躲避迎面吹来的寒风，他尽量低倾着头，使得高大的身躯罗得象一张弓。风吹着尖锐的口哨从后沟道里跑出来，不时把路面的尘土扬到他身上和脸上；路边排水沟里枯黄的树叶和庄稼叶子，随风朝米家镇方向潮涌而去……孙少安到了罐子村的一座小石桥上时，突然看见，他姐夫王满银正跹蹴在路边一个土圪崂里打瞌睡。 \n　　满银筒着双手，缩着脖子，戴着那顶肮脏的破黑呢子帽，蹲在那里连眼皮都不往开睁。 \n　　少安走到他跟前，说：“姐夫，你跹蹴在这儿干啥哩？” \n　　王满银听见少安的声音，慌忙一闪身站起来。他把破呢子帽檐往头顶上扶了扶，咧开嘴不好意思地笑了笑，对小舅子说：“……你姐走后，家里就\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
