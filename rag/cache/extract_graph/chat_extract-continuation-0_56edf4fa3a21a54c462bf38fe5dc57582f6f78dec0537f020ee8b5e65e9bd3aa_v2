But—”\n“I should not have asked,” he said.\n“No.” She shrugged. “There’s good political reason —as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And....” She sighed. “...motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It\ndegrades everything it touches. If | made him do... this, then it would not be his doing.”\n“It’s a thing my Wanna might have said,” he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. “Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men. One of them | love very much. He’s charming, witty, considerate... tender—everything a woman could desire. But the other man is...cold, callous, demanding, selfish—as harsh and cruel as a winter wind. That’s the man Shaped by the father.” Her face contorted. “If only that old man had died when my Duke was born!”\nIn the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds. Presently, she took a deep breath, said, “Leto’s\nright—these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.” She turned, sweeping the room with her gaze. “If you’ll excuse me, Wellington, | want another look through this wing before | assign quarters.”\nHe nodded. “Of course.” And he thought: /f only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.\nJessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out. A// the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no doubt. He’s a good man. Again, She hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh\nand drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn he’s so easily read. | should place more trust in my friends.\nMany have remarked the speed with which Muad’Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.\n—FROM “THE HUMANITY OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh’s sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his mother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn’t approve. Things were too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.\nIf I slip out without asking I haven’t disobeyed orders. And I will stay in the house where it’s safe.\nHe heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were indistinct—something about the spice...the Harkonnens. The conversation rose and fell.\nPaul’s attention went to the carved headboard of his bed—a false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room’s functions. A\nleaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He knew if he pushed the fish’s one visible eye that would turn on the room’s Suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another changed the temperature.\nQuietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side. The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.\nIt was as though the room had been designed to entice him.\nThe room and this planet.\nHe thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him —\"“Arrakis: His Imperial Majesty’s Desert Botanical Testing Station.” It was an old filmbook from before discovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul’s mind, each with its picture imprinted by the book’s mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush...kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse....\nNames and pictures, names and pictures from man’s terranic past—and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.\nSo many new things to learn about—the spice.\nAnd the sandworms.\nA door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother’s footsteps retreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and remain in the other room.\nNow was the moment to go exploring.\nPaul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet. He Stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.\nFrom behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter- seeker no more than five centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once—a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some nearby hand and eye. It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.\nThe seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.\nThrough Paul’s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the room to reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion—anything that moved. A shield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance—and there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.\nNow, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat.\nThe hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.\nI must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom. | must grip tightly.\nThe thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.\nWho is operating that thing? Paul wondered. /t has to be someone near. | could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.\nThe hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.\nThe hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.\nPaul’s right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing’s nose against the metal doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand.\nStill, he held it—to be certain.\nPaul’s eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes.\n“Your father has sent for you,” she said. “There are men in the hall to escort you.”\nPaul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sacklike dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand.\n“I’ve heard of suchlike,” she said. “It would’ve killed me, not so?”\nHe had to swallow before he could speak. “I...was its target.”\n“But it was coming for me.”\n“Because you were moving.” And he wondered: Who is this creature?\n“Then you saved my life,” she said.\n“I saved both our lives.”\n“Seems like you could’ve let it have me and made your own escape,” she said.\n“Who are you?” he asked.\n“The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.”\n“How did you know where to find me?”\n“Your mother told me. | met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall.” She pointed to her right. “Your father’s men are still waiting.”\nThose will be Hawat’s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this thing.\n“Go to my father’s men,” he said. “Tell them I’ve caught a hunter-seeker in the house and they’re to Spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately. They’ll know how to go about it. The operator’s sure to be a stranger among us.”\nAnd he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn’t. The seeker had been under control when she entered.\n“Before | do your bidding, manling,” Mapes said, “l must cleanse the way between us. You’ve put a water burden on me that I’m not sure I care to Support. But we Fremen pay our debts—be they black debts or\nwhite debts. And it’s known to us that you’ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we’re certain sure of it. Mayhap there’s the hand guided that flesh-cutter.”\nPaul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.\nHe thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it. She’d told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat’s men in a minute.\nHis mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memory— prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.\nStill gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.\nShe’d said his mother was someplace down here— Stairs...a weirding room.\nWhat had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: “Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it’s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door.
