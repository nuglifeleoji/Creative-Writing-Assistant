，关、张在右，玄德自引兵居中，与术相见，在门旗下责骂曰：“汝反逆不道，吾今奉明诏前来讨汝！汝当束手受降，免你罪犯。”袁术骂曰：“织席编屦小辈，安敢轻我！”麾兵赶来。玄德暂退，让左右两路军杀出。杀得术军尸横遍野，血流成渠；兵卒逃亡，不可胜计。又被嵩山雷薄、陈兰劫去钱粮草料。欲回寿春，又被群盗所袭，只得住于江亭。止有一千余众，皆老弱之辈。时当盛暑，粮食尽绝，只剩麦三十斛，分派军士。家人无食，多有饿死者。术嫌饭粗，不能下咽，乃命庖人取蜜水止渴。庖人曰：“止有血水，安有蜜水！”术坐于床上，大叫一声，倒于地下，吐血斗余而死。时建安四年六月也。后人有诗曰：汉末刀兵起四方，无端袁术太猖狂，不思累世为公相，便欲孤身作帝王。强暴枉夸传国玺，骄奢妄说应天祥。渴思蜜水无由得，独卧空床呕血亡。”袁术已死，侄袁胤将灵柩及妻子奔庐江来，被徐璆尽杀之。璆夺得玉玺，赴许都献于曹操。操大喜，封徐璆为高陵太守。此时玉玺归操。\n\n    却说玄德知袁术已丧，写表申奏朝廷，书呈曹操，令朱灵、路昭回许都，留下军马保守徐州；一面亲自出城，招谕流散人民复业。\n\n    且说朱灵、路昭回许都见曹操，说玄德留下军马。操怒，欲斩二人。荀彧曰：“权归刘备，二人亦无奈何。”操乃赦之。彧又曰：“可写书与车胄就内图之。”操从其计，暗使人来见车胄，传曹操钧旨。胄随即请陈登商议此事。登曰：“此事极易。今刘备出城招民，不日将还；将军可命军士伏于瓮城边，只作接他，待马到来，一刀斩之；某在城上射住后军，大事济矣。”胄从之。陈登回见父陈珪，备言其事。珪命登先往报知玄德。登领父命，飞马去报，正迎着关、张，报说如此如此。原来关、张先回，玄德在后。张飞听得，便要去厮杀。云长曰：“他伏瓮城边待我，去必有失。我有一计，可杀车胄：乘夜扮作曹军到徐州，引车胄出迎，袭而杀之。”飞然其言。那部下军原有曹操旗号，衣甲都同。当夜三更，到城边叫门。城上问是谁，众应是曹丞相差来张文远的人马。报知车胄，胄急请陈登议曰：“若不迎接，诚恐有疑；若出迎之，又恐有诈。”胄乃上城回言\n######################\nOutput:",
