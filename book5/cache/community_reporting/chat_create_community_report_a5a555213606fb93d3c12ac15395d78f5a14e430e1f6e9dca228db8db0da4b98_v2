It was founded by 叶文洁, who advocates for the idea that all life forms on Earth are born equal. This doctrine, as discussed by 伊文斯, promotes the notion that every species should be treated with the same respect and consideration, regardless of their differences. The philosophy challenges traditional hierarchies that often place human beings above other species, arguing instead for a more egalitarian approach to the coexistence of all life forms. Through this lens, 物种共产主义 seeks to foster a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life and the importance of preserving biodiversity.\",2\r\n709,伊文斯,\"伊文斯是一个复杂而多面的角色，代表了降临派的思想和情感。他深受绝望和对人类的仇恨所驱动，这种情感是降临派意识形态的核心。作为地球三体运动的成员，伊文斯不仅负责向叶文洁介绍三体文明的信息，还提名她为最高统帅，显示出他在这一运动中的重要地位。\n\n在与叶文洁的对话中，伊文斯探讨了物种共产主义以及人类和文明的现状，反映出他对人类未来的深刻思考。他向叶文洁发送了一张明信片，寻求关于如何生活的指导，这表明他在内心深处对生活的迷茫和对理想的追求。\n\n伊文斯最近从美国返回，因父亲的去世和遗产问题而情感受到影响。他考虑利用这笔遗产来阻止毁林，显示出他对环境保护的关注和理想主义的追求。尽管他的父亲是跨国石油公司的总裁，这一背景与他的环保理念形成了鲜明对比，突显了他在理想与现实之间的挣扎。\n\n在审判日号指挥中心工作期间，伊文斯因事故而死，这一悲剧性的结局为他的故事增添了更多的复杂性。他的理想主义和对高尚目标的追求，使他在降临派的背景下显得尤为突出，尽管他与这一派别的联系并不简单。\n\n总的来说，伊文斯是一个理想主义者，致力于保护鸟类和植被，努力在个人情感、家庭背景和社会责任之间找到平衡。他的经历和思想不仅反映了他个人的挣扎，也折射出更广泛的人类文明面临的挑战。\",16\r\n854,亿万富翁,亿万富翁是伊文斯的父亲，曾是跨国石油公司的总裁。,3\r\n855,跨国石油公司,跨国石油公司是亿万富翁所经营的公司，涉及石油勘探和开采。,2\r\n859,志愿者,志愿者是帮助伊文斯在海滩上寻找和拯救受污染海鸟的人。,1\r\n879,京都议定书,\"京都议定书 is an international treaty that the U.S. government recently refused to sign, related to environmental protection.\",1\r\n884,佛教,佛教 is a religion mentioned in the context of its views on the treatment of all living beings.,1\r\n885,基督教,基督教 is a religion referenced in contrast to 佛教 regarding their views on humanity and other species.,1\r\n860,恐龙,恐龙是亿万富翁提到的生物，父亲曾讲述它们的灭绝故事。,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1189,叶文洁,物种共产主义,叶文洁创立了物种共产主义的学说，主张生命的平等。,160\r\n1181,伊文斯,亿万富翁,伊文斯是亿万富翁的儿子，父亲是跨国石油公司的总裁。,19\r\n1182,伊文斯,跨国石油公司,伊文斯的父亲是跨国石油公司的总裁，伊文斯对公司的环境影响感到愤怒。,18\r\n1185,伊文斯,志愿者,伊文斯和志愿者们一起在海滩上工作，寻找受污染的海鸟。,17\r\n1202,伊文斯,京都议定书,伊文斯 references the refusal of the U.S. to sign the 京都议定书 in relation to environmental issues,17\r\n1208,伊文斯,佛教,\"伊文斯 references 佛教 as a belief system that promotes the welfare of all beings, contrasting it with other religions\",17\r\n1209,伊文斯,基督教,\"伊文斯 contrasts 基督教 with 佛教, highlighting differing views on the value of human life versus other species\",17\r\n1186,亿万富翁,跨国石油公司,亿万富翁是跨国石油公司的总裁，负责公司的运营。,5\r\n1187,亿万富翁,恐龙,亿万富翁提到恐龙的灭绝来教育伊文斯。,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
