\n　　干脆！直接给冯主任挂电话！ \n　　他旋即出了自己的窑洞，来到隔壁电话室。 \n　　他让女话务员接通冯主任后，就让她离开话务室——说这个电话话务员不能听。 \n　　他在电话上向冯主任详细汇报了田、张二人在柳岔公社的活动…… \n　　冯世宽在电话上听了周文龙的汇报，心中顿时象塞了一把火！ \n　　他没想到，田福军和张有智两个人处心积虑和他作对。 \n　　不！这不仅是对他冯世宽个人，而是向毛主席的革命路线进攻！ \n　　本来，世宽的情绪眼下正在高涨之时——他的工作成绩已引起地区和省上领导的重视，马上就要在原西县召开现场会了。他希望这个现场会开得轰轰烈烈，让地区和省上的领导亲眼看看他冯世宽的能力和水平。因此，他对现场会的两个主要参观点非常重视，才把田福军和张有智派下去检查督促工作——没想到他们下去却拆他的台！ \n　　说心里话，文龙是冯世宽最看重的公社书记。小伙子路线觉悟高，敢于抓阶级斗争；而且革命干劲又大，上任不久，就把柳岔公社搞成了全县农业学大寨的先进公社。田福军他们打击周文龙，就等于打击他冯世宽！ \n　　决不能容忍这种行为！他应该马上采取措施。否则，这个举足轻重的现场会很可能让田福军和张有智弄塌火。他现在很后悔没坚持让李登云同志去柳岔和石圪节——登云说他牙疼，要在县医院让老中医顾先生扎针，只好把他留在了城关社…… \n　　冯世宽在盛怒之下，决定立即把刚打发出去的县常委们再调回来，开个紧急常委会，解决县领导班子的路线问题和“软、懒、散”问题。 \n　　但他又冷静了一下，考虑到现场会的筹备工作还没做完，他要集中时间和政工组一起修改典型材料，只好推后几天再说。不过他想，一定要尽快解决这问题！必须赶在地区现场会召开之前把县革委会一班人的思想统一起来。 \n　　冯世宽给县革委会办事组指示，让外出的常委们元月七日必须赶回来，八号要开紧急常委会……田福军和张有智离开柳岔公社后，当天晚上就赶到了石圪节。 \n　　因为柳岔的刘志祥已给石圪节挂了电话，白明川下午就从牛家沟的公社会战工地上赶回来，等待县上的两位领导。今年农田基建规模大，明川亲自去会战工地领导。他回公社机关的时候，委托徐治功全面负责工地上的事。 \n　　田福军和张有智听了\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
