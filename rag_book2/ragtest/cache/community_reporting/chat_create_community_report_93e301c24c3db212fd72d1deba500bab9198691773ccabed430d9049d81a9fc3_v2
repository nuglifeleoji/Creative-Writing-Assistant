Initially, it was described as the remarriage of 筱冢康晴 (Yasuharu Shinozuka) and 雪穗, which was kept low-key due to both having been previously married. The ceremony was noted for its subdued nature, with the bride and groom appearing deeply happy.  \n\nHowever, conflicting details emerge regarding another wedding involving 高宫诚 (Makoto Takamiya) and 雪穗, scheduled to take place in two weeks at a hotel in Tokyo. This event is causing 诚 significant internal conflict, suggesting emotional turmoil ahead of the ceremony.  \n\nTo reconcile these contradictions, it appears there may be a timeline discrepancy or overlapping narratives involving 雪穗's marriages. The most coherent interpretation is that 雪穗 was first engaged to 高宫诚, with their wedding impending but marked by his unease, while her later remarriage to 筱冢康晴 was a quieter, more contented affair. Alternatively, the descriptions could refer to the same event with inconsistent naming (possibly due to translation or contextual errors).  \n\nIn summary, the weddings associated with 雪穗 include:  \n1. An upcoming ceremony with 高宫诚, fraught with tension, set in a Tokyo hotel.  \n2. A subdued remarriage to 筱冢康晴, where both appeared joyous.  \nThe exact sequence or accuracy of names may require clarification, but the accounts collectively depict 雪穗's marital transitions as emotionally complex, ranging from conflict to quiet happiness.  \n\n(Word count: 199)\",3\n280,中道正晴,\"中道正晴是雪穗的家庭教师，对雪穗的行为和秘密活动感到好奇和担忧\"\"\",2\n313,唐泽,唐泽是收养雪穗的亲戚的姓氏，同时也是高宫诚的未婚妻。尽管高宫诚对她的感情曾有所动摇，但唐泽在家庭关系中扮演着双重角色：既是雪穗的养亲，又是高宫诚的婚约对象。这一身份使得她在人际关系中处于复杂的位置，既承担着亲属的责任，又面临着感情关系中的不确定性。,2\n320,OFF COURSE,,2\n431,赖子,\"赖子是诚的母亲，与诚的外公外婆一起住在家里。她即将成为雪穗的婆婆，并对这段婚姻持支持态度。赖子性格开朗健谈，这一点在高宫和唐泽两家的聚餐中表现得尤为明显。她对雪穗颇为喜爱，甚至在婚前主动帮忙打扫新房，展现出对儿子和儿媳的关心。  \n\n然而，赖子对诚和雪穗婚后没有孩子一事感到不满，曾建议他们去医院检查，流露出传统家庭观念中对子嗣的期待。此外，当诚因会见朋友而离开家庭聚餐时，赖子表现出明显的不悦，反映出她对家庭团聚的重视以及对儿子行为的关切。  \n\n综合来看，赖子是一位关爱家庭、重视传统的母亲，既支持儿子的婚姻，又对家庭生活的某些方面抱有明确期望，偶尔会因事与愿违而流露出情绪。\",2\n451,高宫文子,\"高宫诚's grandmother, who is supportive of his marriage to 雪穗\",2\n752,集训,\"集训是雪穗和一成在大学时为比赛进行的准备活动\"\"\",2\n141,雪穗的母亲,,1\n138,雪穗的生母,雪穗的亲生母亲，死于煤气中毒，生前生活贫困,1\n282,英语辩论大会,\"雪穗被邀请参加的英语辩论比赛，可能是她偷偷外出的原因之一\"\"\",1\n316,西本,,1\n317,西本文代死亡事件,西本文代被发现死于家中，死因疑似自杀或意外，涉及感冒药和清酒的使用,1\n318,柔和型七星烟,,1\n319,荒井由实,\"荒井由实 is a musician mentioned in the context of the cassette tapes in the room.\"\"\",1\n322,雪穗的母亲去世,\"雪穗的母亲在她小时候因过度劳累和可能的自杀去世，具体日期为五月二十二日，雪穗对此深感悲痛和自责。\"\"\",1\n323,大吉岭,\"大吉岭 is the type of tea served by 雪穗 during their conversation, marking a specific moment in their interaction.\"\"\",1\n456,养母,雪穗's adoptive mother who taught her traditional arts and household skills,1\n454,茶道,A traditional Japanese art that 雪穗 was trained in by her养母,1\n455,花道,Another traditional Japanese art that 雪穗 was trained in by her养母,1\n464,堕胎手术,\"堕胎手术 is the abortion procedure that 雪穗 underwent, which significantly impacted her relationship with 诚.\"\"\",1\n531,证券公司,,1\n528,信托基金,\"信托基金是雪穗投资的金融产品之一，无法立即解约。\"\"\",1\n529,经济报,\"经济报是雪穗阅读的报纸之一，用于获取股票行情信息。\"\"\",1\n530,工业报,\"工业报是雪穗阅读的报纸之一，用于获取股票行情信息。\"\"\",1\n538,房屋中介,,1\n570,意大利,A country where 雪穗 is traveling for business,1\n751,自由之丘三号店,\"自由之丘三号店是雪穗的店铺，即将开业\"\"\",1\n816,宝马车,,1\n818,大阪天空大酒店,\"位于淀屋桥的酒店，雪穗的住所\"\"\",1\n846,滨本,\"滨本是店长，负责雇用临时工，脸色铁青地出现在现场\"\"\n滨本是店长，负责雇用临时工，脸色铁青地出现在现场\",1\n425,千都留,\"千都留 is a multifaceted individual with a professional and personal background that spans various roles and relationships.

He is a graduate of 永明大学 (Eimei University), where he served as the vice president of the social dance club, and he initially fell in love with Yukiho at first sight, leading to a four-year courtship before their marriage. At the time of their engagement, Makoto was preparing for their wedding while secretly harboring feelings for another woman, 三泽千都留 (Misawa Chizuru), with whom he later develops an ambiguous relationship, even taking her to the 公园美景酒店 (Park View Hotel).  \n\nProfessionally, Makoto works at 东西电装 (Tōzai Densō) and is involved in investigating potential plagiarism related to a metal processing expert system. He comes from the affluent 高宫 (Takamiya) family, inheriting multiple properties, yet he feels insecure about Yukiho’s professional success and domestic competence. Their marriage is marked by tension, as Makoto resents Yukiho’s work commitments, neglect of household duties, and stock investments, though he occasionally relents out of guilt or sympathy. He also struggles with alcohol, and there are implications of drunken violence toward Yukiho, though he has no memory of such incidents.  \n\nPersonality-wise, Makoto is passive, prone to dissatisfaction, and often feels he has overlooked critical aspects of his life, particularly in his relationship with Yukiho. He takes golf lessons with Chizuru, despite having little interest or skill in the sport, reflecting his internal conflict between duty and desire. His sense of responsibility initially drives him to marry Yukiho, but he later grapples with regret and unresolved emotions, particularly regarding Chizuru, whom he struggles to reconnect with.  \n\nIn summary, Makoto is a conflicted figure—torn between societal expectations, familial pressures, and personal longing—whose marriage to Yukiho deteriorates amid resentment, insecurity, and external temptations.\",35\n457,银座,\"银座是东京著名的繁华商业区，以其高级精品店和高端购物体验而闻名。与大阪的心斋桥不同，银座以其更为奢华和精致的商业氛围著称，吸引了众多追求高品质消费的游客和本地居民。  \n\n在文学或叙事作品中，银座被描绘为一个重要的社交与商业活动场所。例如，典子曾将银座与心斋桥进行比较，突显两者在风格与定位上的差异。此外，银座也是今枝与筱冢会面的地点，强调了该区域作为商务会谈和人际交往的枢纽地位。  \n\n银座还出现在诚和雪穗的购物场景中，进一步印证了其作为东京高端消费中心的角色。无论是商业会面、休闲购物，还是城市文化象征，银座都以其独特的魅力成为东京不可或缺的地标之一。\",4\n412,东西电装,东西电装（Dongxi Denso）是一家制造汽车电器零件的公司，同时也是高宫诚工作的企业以及三泽千都留曾通过派遣任职的公司。该公司在内部网络安全管理方面有所涉及，具体细节未在描述中详细说明。东西电装作为汽车零部件制造商，可能在生产或研发环节对网络安全有一定要求，但主营业务仍集中在汽车电器零件的制造领域。高宫诚作为正式员工在该公司就职，而三泽千都留则曾以派遣员工身份在此工作。这些信息共同勾勒出东西电装作为一家兼具制造与人力资源管理结构的汽车行业相关企业。,6\n437,阪神老虎队,,2\n435,新宿车站,\"新宿车站是东京的重要交通枢纽，位于东京都新宿区，是日本乃至全球最繁忙的车站之一。它不仅连接了多条JR线路、私营铁路和地铁线路，还因其便利的交通条件成为许多商业活动和日常出行的核心节点。  \n\n在文学作品中，新宿车站也被描绘为人物会面的重要场所，例如小说中诚与筱冢一成的相遇便发生于此。此外，该车站地理位置优越，靠近今枝直巳事务所等商业设施，进一步凸显了其作为城市交通与商业活动中心的重要性。  \n\n综合来看，新宿车站不仅是东京交通网络的关键节点，也是社会互动和商业往来的重要场所，兼具功能性与文化意义。\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n661,高宫赖子,唐泽雪穗,唐泽雪穗和高宫赖子一起打扫新家,99\n1232,滨本夏美,唐泽雪穗,滨本夏美是唐泽雪穗的助手，负责接待和传达指示,97\n108,雪穗,图书馆,\"雪穗 frequently visits the library, which serves as a refuge for her and 亮司.
