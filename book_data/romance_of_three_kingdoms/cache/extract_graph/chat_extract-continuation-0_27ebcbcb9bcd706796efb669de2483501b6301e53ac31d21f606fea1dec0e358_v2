喝令推出斩之。长史杨仪曰：“苟安乃李严用人，又兼钱粮多出于西川，若杀此人，后无人敢送粮也。”孔明乃叱武士去其缚，杖八十放之。苟安被责，心中怀恨，连夜引亲随五六骑，径奔魏寨投降。懿唤入，苟安拜告前事。懿曰：“虽然如此，孔明多谋，汝言难信。汝能为我干一件大功，吾那时奏准天子，保汝为上将。”安曰：“但有甚事，即当效力。”懿曰：“汝可回成都布散流言，说孔明有怨上之意，早晚欲称为帝，使汝主召回孔明：即是汝之功矣。”苟安允诺，径回成都，见了宦官，布散流言，说孔明自倚大功，早晚必将篡国。宦官闻知大惊，即入内奏帝，细言前事。后主惊讶曰：“似此如之奈何？宦官曰：“可诏还成都，削其兵权，免生叛逆。”后主下诏，宣孔明班师回朝。蒋琬出班奏曰：“丞相自出师以来，累建大功，何故宣回？”后主曰：“朕有机密事，必须与丞相面议。”即遣使赍诏星夜宣孔明回。\n\n    使命径到祁山大寨，孔明接入，受诏已毕，仰天叹曰：“主上年幼，必有佞臣在侧！吾正欲建功，何故取回？我如不回，是欺主矣。若奉命而退，日后再难得此机会也。”姜维问曰：“若大军退，司马懿乘势掩杀，当复如何？”孔明曰：“吾今退军，可分五路而退。今日先退此营，假如营内一千兵，却掘二千灶，明日掘三千灶，后日掘四千灶：每日退军，添灶而行。”杨仪曰：“昔孙膑擒庞滑，用添兵减灶之法而取胜；今丞相退兵，何故增灶？”孔明曰：“司马懿善能用兵，知吾兵退，必然追赶；心中疑吾有伏兵，定于旧营内数灶；见每日增灶，兵又不知退与不退，则疑而不敢追。吾徐徐而退，自无损兵之患。”遂传令退军。\n\n    却说司马懿料苟安行计停当，只待蜀兵退时，一齐掩杀。正踌躇间，忽报蜀寨空虚，人马皆去。懿因孔明多谋，不敢轻追，自引百余骑前来蜀营内踏看，教军士数灶，仍回本寨；次日，又教军士赶到那个营内，查点灶数。回报说：“这营内之灶，比前又增一分。”司马懿谓诸将曰：“吾料孔明多谋，今果添兵增灶，吾若追之，必中其计；不如且退，再作良图。”于是回军不追。孔明不折一人，望成都而去。次后，川口土人来报司马懿，说孔明退兵之时，未见添兵，只见增灶。懿仰天长叹曰：“孔明效虞诩之法，瞒过吾也！其�\n######################\nOutput:",
