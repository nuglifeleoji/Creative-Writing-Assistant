have done our best, he thought, and he tried to relax.\nThe Honored Matre laughed.\nWaff stared at her with as calm an expression as he could muster. “You are gauging me now,” he accused. “You say to yourself that you have enormous resources to employ against me, subtle and gross instruments to carry out your commands.”\n“Do not take that tone with me.” The words were low and flat but carried such a weight of venom that Waff almost recoiled.\nHe stared at the stringy muscles of the woman’s legs, that deep red leotard fabric which flowed over her skin as\nthough it were organic to her.\nTheir meeting time had been adjusted to bring them together at a mutually personal mid-morning, their waking hours having been balanced en route. Waff felt dislocated, though, and at a disadvantage. What if the stories of his informants were true? She must have weapons here.\nShe smiled at him without humor.\n“You are trying to intimidate me,” Waff said.\n“And succeeding.” Anger surged through Waff. He kept this from his voice. “I have come at your invitation.”\n“I hope you did not come to engage in a confrontation that you would surely lose,” she said.\n“I came to forge a bond between us,” he said. And he wondered: What do they need from us? Surely they must need something.\n“What bond can there be between us?” she asked. “Would you build an edifice on a disintegrating raft? Hah! Agreements can be broken and often are.”\n“For what tokens do we bargain?” he asked.\n“Bargain? | do not bargain. | am interested in this ghola you made for the witches.” Her tone gave away nothing but Waff’s heartbeat quickened at her question.\nIn one of his ghola lifetimes, Waff had trained under a renegade Mentat. The capabilities of a Mentat were beyond him and besides, reasoning required words. They had been forced to kill the powindah Mentat but there had been some things of value in the experience. Waff allowed himself a small moue of distaste at the memory but he recalled the things of value.\nAttack and absorb the data that attack produces!\n“You offer me nothing in exchange!” he said, his voice loud.\n“Recompense is at my discretion,” she said.\nWaff produced a scornful gaze. “Do you play with me?”\nShe showed white teeth in a feral grin. “You would not Survive my play, nor want to.”\n“So | must be dependent upon your good will!”\n“Dependency!” The word curled from her mouth as though it produced a distasteful sensation. “Why do you sell these gholas to the witches and then kill the gholas?”\nWaff pressed his lips together and remained silent.\n“You have somehow changed this ghola while still making it possible for him to regain his original memories,” she said. “You know so much!” Waff said. It was not quite a sneer\nand, he hoped, revealed nothing. Spies! She had spies among the witches! Was there also a traitor in the Tleilaxu heartlands?\n“There is a girl-child on Rakis who figures in the plans of the witches,” the Honored Matre said.\n“How do you know this?”\n“The witches do not make a move without our knowing! You think of spies but you cannot know how far our arms will reach!”\nWaff was dismayed. Could she read his mind? Was it something born of the Scattering? A wild talent from out there where the original human seed could not observe?\n“How have you changed this ghola?” she demanded.\nVoice!\nWaff, armed against such devices by his Mentat teacher, almost blurted an answer. This Honored Matre had some of the witches’ powers! It had been so unexpected coming from her. You expected such things from a Reverend Mother and were prepared. He was a moment recovering his balance. Waff steepled his hands in front of his chin.\n“You have interesting resources,” she said.\nA gamin expression came over Waff’s features. He knew how disarmingly elflike he could look.\nAttack!\n“We know how much you have learned from the Bene Gesserit,” he said.\nA look of rage swept over her face and was gone. “They have taught us nothing!”\nWaff pitched his voice at a humorously appealing level, cajoling. “Surely, this is not bargaining.”\n“Isn't it?” She actually appeared surprised.\nWaff lowered his hands. “Come now, Honored Matre. You are interested in this ghola. You speak of things on Rakis. What do you take us for?”\n“Very little. You become less valuable by the instant.”\nWaff sensed the coldest machine logic in her response. There was no smell of Mentat in it but something more chilling. She is capable of killing me right here!\nWhere were her weapons? Would she even require weapons? He did not like the look of those stringy muscles, the calluses on her hands, the hunter’s gleam in her orange eyes. Could she possibly guess (or even know) about the dart throwers in his sleeves?\n“We are confronted by a problem that cannot be resolved by logical means,” she said.\nWaff stared at her in shock. A Zensunni Master might have said that! He had said it himself on more than one occasion.\n“You have probably never considered such a possibility,” she said. It was as though her words dropped a mask away from her face. Waff suddenly saw through to the calculating person behind these postures. Did she take him for some padfooted seelie fit only for collecting slig shit?\nBringing as much hesitant puzzlement into his voice as possible, he asked: “How could such a problem be resolved?”\n“The natural course of events will dispose of it,” she said.\nWaff continued to stare at her in simulated puzzlement. Her words did not smack of revelation. Still, the things implied! He said: “Your words leave me floundering.”\n“Humankind has become infinite,” she said. “That is the true gift of the Scattering.”\nWaff fought to conceal the turmoil these words created. “Infinite universes, infinite time—anything may happen,” he\nsaid.\n“Ahhh, you are a bright little manikin,” she said. “How does one allow for anything? It is not logical.”\nShe sounded, Waff thought, like one of the ancient leaders of the Butlerian Jihad, which had tried to rid humankind of mechanical minds. This Honored Matre was strangely out of date.\n“Our ancestors looked for an answer with computers,” he ventured. Let her try that!\n“You already know that computers lack infinite storage Capacity,” she said.\nAgain, her words disconcerted him. Could she actually read minds? Was this a form of mind-printing? What the Tleilaxu did with Face Dancers and gholas, others might do as well. He centered his awareness and concentrated on Ixians, on their evil machines. Powindah machines!\nThe Honored Matre swept her gaze around the room. “Are we wrong to trust the Ixians?” she asked.\nWaff held his breath.\n“I don’t think you fully trust them,” she said. “Come, come, little man. | offer you my good will.”\nBelatedly, Waff began to suspect that she was trying to be friendly and candid with him. She certainly had put aside her earlier pose of angry superiority. Waff’s informants from the Lost Ones said the Honored Matres made sexual decisions much in the manner of the Bene Gesserit. Was she trying to be seductive? But she clearly understood and had exposed the weakness of logic.\nIt was very confusing!\n“We are talking in circles,” he said.\n“Quite the contrary. Circles enclose. Circles limit. Humankind no longer is limited by the space in which to grow.”\nThere she went again! He spoke past a dry tongue: “It is said that what you cannot control you must accept.”\nShe leaned forward, the orange eyes intent on his face. “Do you accept the possibility of a final disaster for the Bene Tleilax?”\n“If that were the case | would not be here.”\n“When logic fails, another tool must be used.”\nWaff grinned. “That sounds logical.”\n“Don’t mock me! How dare you!”\nWaff lifted his hands defensively and assumed a placating tone: “What tool would the Honored Matre suggest?”\n“Energy!”\nHer answer surprised him. “Energy? In what form and how much?”\n“You demand logical answers,” she said.\nWith a feeling of sadness, Waff realized that she was not, after all, Zensunni. The Honored Matre only played word games on the fringes of non-logic, circling it, but her tool was logic.\n“Rot at the core spreads outward,” he said.\nIt was as though she had not heard his testing statement. “There is untapped energy in the depths of any human we deign to touch,” she said. She extended a skeletal finger to within a few millimeters of his nose.\nWaff pulled back into his chair until she dropped her arm. He said: “Is that not what the Bene Gesserit said before producing their Kwisatz Haderach?”\n“They lost control of themselves and of him,” she sneered.\nAgain, Waff thought, she employed logic in thinking of the non-logical. How much she had told him in these little lapses. He could glimpse the probable history of these Honored Matres. One of the natura/ Reverend Mothers from the Fremen of Rakis had gone out in the Scattering. Diverse people had fled on the no-ships during and immediately after the Famine Times. A no-ship had seeded the wild witch and her concepts somewhere. That seed had returned in the form of this orange-eyed huntress.\nOnce more she hurled Voice at him, demanding: “What have you wrought with this ghola?”\nThis time, Waff was prepared and shrugged it off. This Honored Matre would have to be deflected or, if possible, Slain. He had learned much from her but there was no way of telling how much she had learned from him with her unguessed talents.\nThey are sexual monsters, his informants had said. They enslave men by the powers of sex.\n“How little you know the joys | could give you,” she said. Her voice coiled like a whip around him. How tempting! How seductive!\nWaff spoke defensively: “Tell me why you—”\n“I need tell you nothing!”\n“Then you did not come to bargain.” He spoke sadly. The no-ships had, indeed, seeded those other universes with rot. Waff sensed the weight of necessity on his shoulders. What if he could not slay her?\n“How dare you keep suggesting a bargain with an Honored Matre?” she demanded. “Know you that we set the price!”\n“I do not Know your ways, Honored Matre,” Waff said. “But | sense in your words that | have offended.”\n“Apology accepted.”\nNo apology intended! He stared at her blandly. Many things could be deduced from her performance. Out of his millennial experiences, Waff reviewed what he had learned here. This female from the Scattering came to him for an essential piece of information. Therefore, she had no other source. He sensed desperation in her. Well masked but definitely there. She needed confirmation or refutation of something she feared.\nHow like a predatory bird she was, sitting there with her claw hands so lightly on the arms of her chair! Rot at the core spreads outward. He had said it and she had not heard. Clearly, atomic humankind", " shoulders. What if he could not slay her?\n“How dare you keep suggesting a bargain with an Honored Matre?” she demanded. “Know you that we set the price!”\n“I do not Know your ways, Honored Matre,” Waff said. “But | sense in your words that | have offended.”\n“Apology accepted.”\nNo apology intended!

She needed confirmation or refutation of something she feared.\nHow like a predatory bird she was, sitting there with her claw hands so lightly on the arms of her chair! Rot at the core spreads outward. He had said it and she had not heard. Clearly, atomic humankind continued to explode on its\nScatterings of Scatterings. The people represented by this Honored Matre had not found a way to trace the no-ships. That was it, of course. She hunted the no-ships just as the witches of the Bene Gesserit did.\n“You seek the way to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility,” he said.\nThe statement obviously rocked her. She had not expected this from the elflike manikin seated in front of her. He saw fear, then anger, then resolution pass across her features before she resumed her predatory mask. She knew, though. She knew he had seen.\n“So that is what you do with your ghola,” she said.\n“It is what the witches of the Bene Gesserit seek with him,” Waff lied.\n“I underestimated you,” she said. “Did you make the same mistake with me?”\n“I do not think so, Honored Matre. The breeding scheme that produced you is quite obviously formidable. | think you could kick out a foot and kill me before | blinked an eye. The witches are not in the same league with you.”\nA smile of pleasure softened her features. “Are the Tleilaxu to be our willing servants or compelled?”\nHe did not try to hide outrage. “You offer us slavery?”\n“That is one of your options.”\nHe had her now! Arrogance was her weakness. Submissively, he asked: “What would you command me to do?”\n“You will take back as your guests two younger Honored Matres. They are to be bred with you and... teach you our ways of ecstasy.”\nWaff inhaled and exhaled two slow breaths.\n“Are you sterile?” she asked.\n“Only our Face Dancers are mules.” She would already know that. It was common knowledge.\n“You call yourself Master,” she said, “yet you have not mastered yourself.”\nMore than you, Honored Matre bitch! And | call myself Masheikh, a fact that may yet destroy you.\n“The two Honored Matres | send with you will make an inspection of everything Tleilaxu and return to me with their report,” she said.\nHe sighed as though in resignation. “Are the two younger women comely?”\n“Honored Matres!” she corrected him.\n“Is that the only name you use?”\n“If they choose to give you names, that is their privilege, not yours.” She leaned sideways and rapped a bony knuckle against the floor. Metal gleamed in her hand. She had a way of penetrating this room’s shielding!\nThe hatch opened and two women dressed much like his Honored Matre entered. Their dark capes carried less decoration and both women were younger. Waff stared at them. Were they both... He tried not to show elation but knew he failed. No matter. The older one would think he admired the beauty of these two. By signs known only to the Masters, he saw that one of the two newcomers was a new Face Dancer. A successful exchange had been made and these Scattered Ones could not detect it! The Tleilaxu had successfully passed a hurdle! Would the Bene Gesserit be as blind to these new gholas?\n“You are being sensibly agreeable about this, for which you will be rewarded,” the old Honored Matre said.\n“| recognize your powers, Honored Matre,” he said. That was true. He bowed his head to conceal the resolution that he knew he could not keep from his eyes.\nShe gestured to the newcomers. “These two will accompany you. Their slightest whim is your command. They will be treated with all honor and respect.”\n“Of course, Honored Matre.” Keeping his head bowed, he lifted both arms as though in salutation and submission. A dart hissed from each sleeve. As he released the darts, Waff jerked himself sideways in his chair. The motion was not\nquite rapid enough. The old Honored Matre’s right foot shot out, catching him in the left thigh and hurling him backward on his chair.\nIt was the old Honored Matre’s last living act. The dart from his left sleeve caught her in the back of her throat, entering through her opened mouth, a mouth left gaping in Surprise. Narcotic poison cut off any outcry. The other dart hit the non-Face Dancer of the newcomers in the right eye. His Face Dancer accomplice cut off any warning shout by a blurred chop to the throat.\nTwo bodies slumped in death.\nPainfully, Waff disentangled himself from the chair and righted it as he got to his feet. His thigh throbbed. A fraction of a meter more and she would have broken his thigh! He realized that her reaction had not been mediated by her central nervous system. As with some insects, attack could be initiated by the required muscle system. That development would have to be investigated!\nHis Face Dancer accomplice was listening at the open hatch. She stepped aside to allow the entry of another Face Dancer in the guise of an Ixian guard.\nWaff massaged his injured thigh while his Face Dancers disrobed the dead women. The one who copied the Ixian put her head to that of the dead old Honored Matre. Things moved swiftly after that. Presently, there was no Ixian guard, only a faithful copy of the old Honored Matre and a younger Honored Matre attendant. Another pseudo-lxian entered and copied the younger Honored Matre. Soon, there were only ashes where dead flesh had been. A new Honored Matre scooped the ashes into a bag and concealed it beneath her robe.\nWaff made a careful examination of the room. The consequences of discovery made him shudder. Such arrogance as he had seen here came from obviously awesome powers. Those powers must be probed. He detained the Face Dancer who had copied the old one.\n“You have printed her?”\n“Yes, Master. Her waking memories were still alive when | copied.”\n“Transfer to her.” He gestured to the one who had been an Ixian guard. They touched foreheads for a few heartbeats then parted.\n“It is done,” said the older one.\n“How many other copies of these Honored Matres have we made?”\n“Four, Master.”\n“None of them detected?”\n“None, Master.”\n“Those four must return to the heartland of these Honored Matres and learn all there is to know about them. One of those four must get back to us with what is learned.”\n“That is impossible, Master.”\n“Impossible?”\n“They have cut themselves off from their source. This is their way, Master. They are a new cell and have established themselves on Gammu.”\n“But surely we could...”\n“Your pardon, Master. The coordinates of their place in the Scattering were contained only in a no-ship’s workings and have been erased.”\n“Their tracks are completely covered?” There was dismay in his voice.\n“Completely, Master.”\nDisaster! He was forced to rein in his thoughts from a sudden frenzied darting. “They must not learn what we have done here,” he muttered.\n“They will not learn from us, Master.”\n“What talents have they developed? What powers? Quickly!”\n“They are what you would expect from a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit but without the melange memories.”\n“You're sure?”\n“There is no hint of it. As you Know, Master, we—”\n“Yes, yes. | know.” He waved her to silence. “But the old one was So arrogant, so...”\n“Your pardon, Master, but time presses. These Honored Matres have perfected the pleasures of sex far beyond that developed by any others.”\n“So it’s true what our informants said.”\n“They went back to the primitive Tantric and developed their own ways of sexual stimulation, Master. Through this, they accept the worship of their followers.”\n“Worship.” He breathed the word. “Are they superior to the Breeding Mistresses of the Sisterhood?”\n“The Honored Matres believe so, Master. Shall we demon\n”\n“No!” Waff dropped his elfin mask at this discovery and assumed the expression of a dominant Master. The Face Dancers nodded their heads in submission. A look of glee came over Waff’s face. The returned Tleilaxu of the Scattering reported truthfully! By a simple mind-print he had confirmed this new weapon of his people!\n“What are your orders, Master?” the old one asked.\nWaff resumed his elfin mask. “We will explore these matters only when we have returned to the Tleilaxu core at Bandalong. Meanwhile, even a Master does not give orders to an Honored Matre. You are my masters until we are free of prying eyes.”\n“Of course, Master. Shall | now convey your orders to the others outside?”\n“Yes, and these are my orders: This no-ship must never return to Gammu. It must vanish without a trace. No Survivors.”\n“It will be done, Master.”\nTechnology, in common with many other activities, tends toward avoidance of risks by investors. Uncertainty is ruled out if possible. Capital investment follows this rule, since people generally prefer the predictable. Few recognize how destructive this can be, how it imposes severe limits on variability and thus makes whole populations fatally vulnerable to the shocking ways our universe can throw the dice.\n—ASSESSMENT OF IX, BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nO n the morning after that initial test in the desert, Sheeana awoke in the priestly complex to find her bed surrounded by white-robed people.\nPriests and priestesses!\n“She’s awake,” a priestess said.\nFear gripped Sheeana. She clutched the bed covers close to her chin while she stared out at those intent faces. Were they going to abandon her in the desert again? She had Slept the sleep of exhaustion in the softest bed with the cleanest linen she had experienced in her eight years but she knew everything the priests did could have a double meaning. They were not to be trusted!\n“Did you sleep well?” It was the priestess who had spoken first. She was a gray-haired older woman, her face framed in a white cowl with purple trim. The old eyes were watery but alert. Pale blue. The nose was an upturned stub above a narrow mouth and outjutting chin.\n“Will you speak to us?” the woman persisted. “I am Cania, your night attendant. Remember? | helped you into your bed.”\nAt least, the tone of voice was reassuring. Sheeana sat up and took a better look at these people. They were afraid! A desert child’s nose could detect the telltale pheromones. To\nSheeana, it was a simple, straightforward observation: That smell equals fear.\n“You thought you would hurt me,” she said. “Why did you do that?”", " experienced in her eight years but she knew everything the priests did could have a double meaning.

A desert child’s nose could detect the telltale pheromones. To\nSheeana, it was a simple, straightforward observation: That smell equals fear.\n“You thought you would hurt me,” she said. “Why did you do that?”\nThe people around her exchanged looks of consternation.\nSheeana’s fear dissipated. She had sensed the new order of things and yesterday’s trial in the desert meant more change. She recalled how subservient the older woman... Cania? She had been almost groveling the previous night. Sheeana would learn in time that any person who lived through the decision to die evolved a new emotional balance. Fears were transitory. This new condition was interesting.\nCania’s voice trembled when she responded: “Truly, Child of God, we did not intend harm.”\nSheeana straightened the bedcovers on her lap. “My name is Sheeana.” That was desert politeness. Cania already had produced a name. “Who are these others?”\n“They will be sent away if you don’t want them... Sheeana.” Cania indicated a florid-faced woman at her left dressed in a robe similar to her own. “All except Alhosa, of course. She is your day attendant.”\nAlhosa curtsied at the introduction.\nSheeana stared up at a face puffy with waterfat, heavy features in a nimbus of fluffy blond hair. Shifting her attention abruptly, Sheeana looked at the men in the group. They watched her with heavy-lidded intentness, some with looks of trembling suspicion. The fear smell was strong.\nPriests!\n“Send them away.” Sheeana waved a hand at the priests. “They are haram!” It was the gutter word, the lowest term of all for that which was most evil.\nThe priests recoiled in shock.\n“Begone!” Cania commanded. There was no mistaking the look of malevolent glee on her face. Cania had not been included among the vile ones. But these priests clearly\nstood among those labeled as haram! They must have done something hideous for God to send a child-priestess to chastise them. Cania could believe it of priests. They had seldom treated her the way she deserved.\nLike chastened bedogs, the priests bowed themselves backward and left Sheeana’s chamber. Among those who went out into the hallway was a historian-locutor named Dromind, a dark man with a busy mind that tended to fasten onto ideas like the beak of a carrion bird onto a morsel of meat. When the chamber door closed behind them, Dromind told his trembling companions that the name Sheeana was a modern form of the ancient name, Siona.\n“You all know Siona’s place in the histories,” he said. “She served Shai-hulud in His transformation from human shape into the Divided God.”\nStiros, a wrinkled older priest with dark lips and pale, glistening eyes, looked wonderingly at Dromind. “That is extremely curious,” Stiros said. “The Oral Histories claim that Siona was instrumental in His translation from the One into the Many. Sheeana. Do you think...”\n“Let us not forget the Hadi Benotto translation of God’s own holy words,” another priest interrupted. “Shai-hulud referred many times to Siona.”\n“Not always with favor,” Stiros reminded them. “Remember her full name: Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides.”\n“Atreides,” another priest whispered.\n“We must study her with care,” Dromind said.\nA young acolyte-messenger hurried up the hallway to the group and sought among them until he spied Stiros. “Stiros,” the messenger said, “you must clear this hallway immediately.”\n“Why?” It was an indignant voice from the press of the rejected priests.\n“She is to be moved into the High Priest’s quarters,” the messenger said.\n“By whose orders?” Stiros demanded.\n“High Priest Tuek himself says this,” the messenger said. “They have been listening.” He waved a hand vaguely toward the direction from which he had come.\nAll of the group in the hall understood. Rooms could be shaped to send voices from them into other places. There were always listeners.\n“What have they heard?” Stiros demanded. His old voice quavered.\n“She asked if her quarters were the best. They are about to move her and she must not find any of you out here.”\n“But what are we to do?” Stiros asked.\n“Study her,” Dromind said.\nThe hall was cleared immediately and all of them began the process of studying Sheeana. The pattern born here would print itself on all of their lives over the subsequent years. The routine that took shape around Sheeana produced changes felt in the farthest reaches of the Divided God’s influence. Two words ignited the change: “Study her.”\nHow naive she was, the priests thought. How curiously naive. But she could read and she displayed an intense interest in the Holy Books she found in Tuek’s quarters. Her quarters now.\nAll was propitiation from the highest to the lowest. Tuek moved into the quarters of his chief assistant and the bumping process moved downward. Fabricators waited upon Sheeana and measured her. The finest stillsuit was fashioned for her. She acquired new robes of priestly gold and white with purple trim.\nPeople began avoiding historian-locutor Dromind. He took to buttonholing his fellows and expounding the history of the original Siona as though this said something important about the present bearer of the ancient name.\n“Siona was the mate of the Holy Duncan Idaho,” Dromind reminded anyone who would listen. “Their descendants are everywhere.”\n“Indeed? Pardon me for not listening further but | am really on an urgent errand.”\nAt first, Tuek was more patient with Dromind. The history was interesting and its lessons obvious. “God has sent us a new Siona,” Tuek said. “All should be clear.”\nDromind went away and returned with more tidbits from the past. “The accounts from Dar-es-Balat take on a new meaning now,” Dromind told his High Priest. “Should we not make further tests and comparisons of this child?”\nDromind had braced the High Priest immediately after breakfast. The remains of Tuek’s meal still occupied the serving table on the balcony. Through the open window, they could hear stirrings overhead in Sheeana’s quarters.\nTuek put a cautioning finger to his lips and spoke ina hushed voice. “The Holy Child goes of her own choice to the desert.” He went to a wall map and pointed to an area southwest of Keen. “Apparently this is an area that interests her or... | should say, calls her.”\n“lam told she makes frequent use of dictionaries,” Dromind said. “Surely, that cannot be a—”\n“She is testing us,” Tuek said. “Do not be fooled.”\n“But Lord Tuek, she asks the most childish questions of Cania and Alhosa.”\n“Do you question my judgment, Dromind?”\nBelatedly, Dromind realized he had overstepped the proper bounds. He fell silent but his expression said many more words were compressed within him.\n“God has sent her to weed out some evil that has crept into the ranks of the anointed,” Tuek said. “Go! Pray and ask yourself if that evil has lodged itself within you.”\nWhen Dromind had gone, Tuek summoned a trusted aide. “Where is the Holy Child?”\n“She has gone out into the desert, Lord, to commune with her Father.”\n“To the southwest?”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“Dromind must be taken far out to the east and left on the sand. Plant several thumpers to make sure he never returns.”\n“Dromind, Lord?”\n“Dromind.”\nEven after Dromind was translated into the Mouth of God, the priests continued to follow his original injunction. They studied Sheeana.\nSheeana also studied.\nGradually, so gradually that she could not identify the point of transition, she recognized her great power over those around her. At first, it was a game, a continual Children’s Day with adults jumping to obey each childish whim. But it appeared that no whim was too difficult.\nDid she require a rare fruit for her table?\nThe fruit was served to her on a golden dish.\nDid she glimpse a child far below on the teeming streets and require that child as a playmate?\nThat child was hustled up to Sheeana’s temple quarters. When fear and shock passed, the child might even join in some game, which the priests and priestesses observed intently. Innocent skipping about on the rooftop garden, giggling whispers—all were subjected to intense analysis. Sheeana found the awe of such children a burden. She seldom called the same child back to her, preferring to learn new things from new playmates.\nThe priests achieved no consensus about the innocence of such encounters. The playmates were put through fearful interrogation until Sheeana discovered this and raged at her guardians.\nInevitably, word of Sheeana spread throughout Rakis and off-planet. The Sisterhood’s reports accumulated. The years passed in a kind of sublimely autocratic routine—feeding Sheeana’s curiosity. It was a curiosity that appeared to have no limits. None of those among the immediate attendants thought of this as education: Sheeana teaching the priests\nof Rakis and they teaching her. The Bene Gesserit, however, observed this aspect of Sheeana’s life at once and watched it closely.\n“She is in good hands. Leave her there until she is ready for us,” Taraza ordered. “Keep a defense force on constant alert and see that | get regular reports.”\nNot once did Sheeana reveal her true origins nor what Shaitan had done to her family and neighbors. That was a private thing between Shaitan and herself. She thought of her silence as payment for having been spared.\nSome things paled for Sheeana. She made fewer trips into the desert. Curiosity continued but it became obvious that an explanation of Shaitan’s behavior toward her might not be found on the open sand. And although she knew there were embassies of other powers on Rakis, the Bene Gesserit spies among her attendants made sure that Sheeana did not express too much interest in the Sisterhood. Soothing answers to dampen such interest were provided and metered out to Sheeana as required.\nThe message from Taraza to her observers on Rakis was direct and pointed: “The generations of preparation have become the years of refinement. We will move only at the proper moment. There is no longer any doubt that this child is the one.”\nIn my estimation, more misery has been created by reformers than by any other force in human history.
