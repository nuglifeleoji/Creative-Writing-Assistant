Their relationship is characterized by a fierce competition in military tactics, as each leader seeks to outmaneuver the other on the battlefield.\n\nKong Ming, also known as Zhuge Liang, is particularly concerned about the growing power of Si Ma Yi, recognizing him as a significant threat to the state of Shu.
