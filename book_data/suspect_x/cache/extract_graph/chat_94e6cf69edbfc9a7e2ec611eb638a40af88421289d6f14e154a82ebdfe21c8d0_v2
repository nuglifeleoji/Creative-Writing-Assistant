The worm turned slightly to the right and moved between two giant boulders that towered above them. It came to a stop. The long ridged back lay parallel to a mostly intact section of the wall’s base.\nSheeana stood and looked at the barrier.\n“What is this place?” Waff asked. He raised his voice above the sound of the ’thopters circling overhead.\nOdrade released her tiring grip and flexed her fingers. She continued to kneel while she studied their surroundings. Shadows from the tumbled boulders drew hard lines on sand spills and smaller rocks. Seen close up, not twenty meters away, the wall revealed cracks and fissures, dark openings into the ancient foundation.\nWaff stood and massaged his hands.\n“Why have we been brought here?” he asked. His voice was faintly plaintive.\nThe worm twitched.\n“Shaitan wants us to get off,” Sheeana said.\nHow does she know? Odrade wondered. The worm’s movement had not been enough to make any of them stumble. It could have been some private reflex after the long journey.\nBut Sheeana faced the ancient wall’s foundation, sat down on the curve of the worm and slid off. She dropped in a crouch on soft sand.\nOdrade and Waff moved forward and watched with fascination as Sheeana slogged through the sand to the front of the creature. There, Sheeana placed both hands on her hips and faced the gaping mouth. Hidden flames played orange light across the young face.\n“Shaitan, why are we here?” Sheeana demanded.\nAgain, the worm twitched.\n“He wants all of you off him,” Sheeana called.\nWaff looked at Odrade. “If God wishes thee to die, He causes thy steps to lead thee to the place of thy death.”\nOdrade gave him back a paraphrase from the cant of the Shariat: “Obey God’s messenger in all things.”\nWaff sighed. Doubt was plain on his face. But he turned and was first off the worm, dropping just ahead of Odrade. They followed Sheeana’s example, moving to the front of the creature. Odrade, every sense alert, fixed her gaze on Sheeana.\nIt was much hotter in front of the gaping mouth. The familiar bite of melange filled the air around them.\n“We are here, God,” Waff said.\nOdrade, getting more than a little tired of his religious awe, spared a glance for their surroundings—the shattered rocks, the eroded barrier reaching into the dusky sky, sand sloping against the time-scarred stones, and the slow scorching huff-huff of the worm’s internal fires.\nBut where is here? Odrade wondered. What Is special about this place to make it the worm’s destination?\nFour of the watching ‘thopters passed in line overhead. The sound of their wing fans and the hissing jets momentarily drowned out the worm’s background rumblings.\nShall I call them down? Odrade wondered. It would take only a hand signal. Instead, she lifted two hands in the signal for the watchers to remain aloft.\nEvening’s chill was on the sand now. Odrade shivered and adjusted her metabolism to the new demands. She felt confident that the worm would not engulf them with Sheeana beside them.\nSheeana turned her back on the worm. “He wants us to be here,” she said.\nAs though her words were a command, the worm twisted its head away from them and slid off through the tall scattering of giant boulders. They could hear it speeding away back into the desert.\nOdrade faced the base of the ancient wall. Darkness would be upon them soon but enough light remained in the high desert’s long dusk that they might yet see some explanation of why the creature had brought them here. A tall fissure in the rock wall to her right seemed as good a place to investigate as any. Keeping part of her attention on the sounds from Waff, Odrade climbed a sandy incline toward the dark opening. Sheeana kept pace with her.\n“Why are we here, Mother?”\nOdrade shook her head. She heard Waff following.\nThe fissure directly in front of her was a shadowy hole into darkness. Odrade stopped and held Sheeana beside her. She judged the opening to be about a meter wide and some four times that in height. The rocky sides were curiously smooth, as though polished by human hands. Sand had drifted into the opening. Light from the setting sun reflected off the sand to bathe one side of the opening ina wash of gold.\nWaff spoke from behind them: “What is this place?”\n“There are many old caves,” Sheeana said. “Fremen hid their spice in caves.” She inhaled deeply through her nose. “Do you smell it, Mother?”\nThere was a definite melange odor to the place, Odrade agreed.\nWaff moved past Odrade and into the fissure. He turned there, looking up at the walls where they met in a sharp angle above him. Facing Odrade and Sheeana, he backed farther into the opening, his attention on the walls. Odrade and Sheeana stepped closer to him. With an abrupt hissing of spilled sand, Waff vanished from their sight. In the same instant, the sand all around Odrade and Sheeana slipped\nforward into the fissure, dragging both of them with it. Odrade grabbed Sheeana’s hand.\n“Mother!” Sheeana cried.\nThe sound echoed from invisible rock walls as they slid down a long slope of spilling sand into concealing darkness. The sand drifted them to a stop in a final wash of gentle movement. Odrade, in sand up to her knees, extricated herself and pulled Sheeana with her onto a hard surface.\nSheeana started to speak but Odrade said: “Hush! Listen!”\nThere was a grating disturbance off to the left.\n“Waff?”\n“I'm in it up to my waist.” There was terror in his voice.\nOdrade spoke dryly. “God must want it that way. Pull yourself out gently. It feels like rock under our feet. Gently now! We don’t need another avalanche.”\nAs her eyes adjusted, Odrade looked up the sand slope down which they had tumbled. The opening where they had entered this place was a distant slit of dusky gold far away above them.\n“Mother,” Sheeana whispered. “I’m scared.”\n“Say the Litany Against Fear,” Odrade ordered. “And be still. Our friends know we are here. They will help us get out.”\n“God has brought us to this place,” Waff said.\nOdrade did not respond. In the silence, she pursed her lips and gave a high-pitched whistle, listening for the echoes. Her ears told her they were in a large space with some sort of low obstruction behind them. She turned her back on the narrow fissure and gave another whistle.\nThe low barrier lay about a hundred meters away.\nOdrade freed her hand from Sheeana’s. “Stay right here, please. Waff?”\n“| hear the ’thopters,” he said.\n“We all hear them,” Odrade said. “They are landing. We will have help presently. Meanwhile, please stay where you\nare and remain silent. | need the silence.”\nWhistling and listening for the echoes, placing each foot carefully, Odrade worked her way deeper into the darkness. An outstretched hand encountered a rough rock surface. She felt along it. Only about waist high. She could feel nothing beyond it. The echoes of her whistles said it was a smaller space there and partly enclosed.\nA voice called from high behind her. “Reverend Mother! Are you there?”\nOdrade turned, cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted: “Stay back! We’ve been spilled into a deep cave. Bring a light and a long rope.”\nA tiny dark figure moved back out of the distant opening. The light up there was growing dimmer. She lowered her cupped hands and spoke into the darkness.\n“Sheeana? Waff? Come toward me about ten paces and wait there.”\n“Where are we, Mother?” Sheeana asked.\n“Patience, child.”\nA low, muttering sound came from Waff. Odrade recognized the ancient words of the Islamiyat. He was praying. Waff had dropped all attempts to conceal his origins from her. Good. The believer was a receptacle for her to feed with the sweets of the Missionaria Protectiva.\nMeanwhile, the possibilities of this place where the worm had brought them excited Odrade. Guided by one hand on the rock barrier, she explored along it to her left. The top was quite smooth in places. All of it sloped inward away from her. Other Memories offered a sudden projection:\nCatchbasin!\nThis was a Fremen water storage basin. Odrade inhaled deeply, testing for moisture. The air was flint dry.\nA bright light from the fissure stabbed downward, driving away the darkness. A voice called from the opening and Odrade recognized it as one of her Sisters.\n“We can see you!”\nOdrade stepped back from the low barrier and turned, peering all around. Waff and Sheeana stood about sixty meters away staring at their surroundings. The chamber was roughly circular, some two hundred meters in diameter. A rock dome arched high overhead. She examined the low barrier beside her: yes, a Fremen catchbasin. She could discern the small rock island in its center where a captive worm could be kept ready to spill into the water. Other Memories replayed that agonized, twisting death which produced the spice poison to ignite a Fremen orgy.\nA low arch framed more darkness on the far side of the basin. She could see the spillway there where water had been brought down from a windtrap. There would be more catchbasins back there, an entire complex of them designed to hold a wealth of moisture for an ancient tribe. She knew the name of this place now.\n“Sietch Tabr,” Odrade whispered.\nThe words ignited a flood of useful memories. This had been Stilgar’s place in the time of Muad’Dib. Why did that worm bring us to Sietch Tabr?\nA worm took Sheeana to the City of Keen. That others might know of her? Then what was there to know here? Were there people back there in that darkness? Odrade sensed no indications of life in that direction.\nHer Sister at the opening interrupted these thoughts. “We've had to ask for the rope to be brought from Dar-es- Balat! The people at the museum say this is probably Sietch Tabr! They thought it had been destroyed!”\n“Send down a light so | can explore it,” Odrade called.\n“The priests ask that we leave it undisturbed!”\n“Send me a light!” Odrade insisted.\nPresently, a dark object tumbled down the sandslope ina small spill of sand. Odrade sent Sheeana scampering for it. A touch on the switch and a bright beam went lancing at the dark archway beyond the catchbasin. Yes, more basins there. And beside this basin, a narrow stairway cut into the\nrock. The steps led upward, turning and removing themselves from her view.\nOdrade bent and whispered in Sheeana’s ear. “Watch Waff carefully. If he moves after us, call out.”\n“Yes, Mother. Where are we going?”\n“I must look at this place. | am the one who has been brought here for a purpose.” She raised her voice and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_94e6cf69edbfc9a7e2ec611eb638a40af88421289d6f14e154a82ebdfe21c8d0_v2"}
