His actions were a calculated move to eliminate a rival power and consolidate his dominance over the planet and its valuable resources. While the descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—one highlighting the Sardaukar's involvement and the other focusing on the Baron's broader strategies—they agree on the central role he played in House Atreides' destruction. The Baron's campaign against House Atreides was a multifaceted effort, combining subterfuge, economic pressure, and outright military assault to achieve his goals.
