scanner no longer moved. The nullfield was turned off and she felt gravity. The hatch directly in front of her opened. Temperature pleasantly warm. Noise out there. Children playing some competitive game?\nLuggage floating behind, she stepped onto a short flight of steps and saw that the noise did indeed come from a large group of children in a nearby field. In their high teens and female. They were butting a suspensor float-ball back and forth, shouting and screaming as they played.\nStaged for our benefit?\nOdrade thought it likely. There probably were two thousand young women on that field.\nLook how many recruits we have coming along!\nNo one to greet her but Odrade saw a familiar structure down a paved lane to her left. Obvious Spacing Guild artifact with a recent tower added. She spoke of the tower as she glanced around her, giving the implaned transmitter\ndata on a change from Teg’s groundplan. Nobody who had ever seen a Guild building could mislabel this place, though.\nSo this was like other Junction planets. Somewhere in Guild records there doubtless was a serial number and code for it. So long under Guild control before Honored Matres that, in these first moments of debarking, getting their “ground legs,” everything around them could be seen to have that special Guild flavor. Even the playing field— designed for outdoor meetings of Navigators in their giant containers of melange gas.\nThe Guild flavor: It was compounded of Ixian technology and Navigator design—buildings wrapped around space in the most energy-conserving way, paths direct; few slide- walks. They were wasteful and only the gravity-bound needed them. No flowery plantings near the Landing Flat. They were susceptible to accidental destruction. And that permanent grayness to all construction—not silver but as dull as Tleilaxu skin.\nThe structure on her left was a great bulging shape with extrusions, some rounded and some angular. This had been no lavish hostelry. Opulent little nooks, of course, but those were rare, built for VVIPs, mostly inspectors from the Guild.\nOnce more, Teg is right. Honored Matres kept existing structures, remodeling minimally. A tower!\nOdrade reminded herself then: This is not only another world but also another society with its own social glue. She had a handle on that from Sharing with Murbella but did not think she had plumbed what held Honored Matres together. Surely not just a lusting after power.\n“We'll walk,” she said and led the way down the paved lane toward the giant structure.\nGoodbye, Clairby. Blow your ship as soon as you can. Let it be our first great surprise for Honored Matres.\nThe Guild structure loomed higher as they approached.\nThe most astonishing thing to Odrade whenever she saw one of these functional constructions was that someone had\ntaken a great deal of care in planning it. Intentional detail in everything although you sometimes had to dig for it. Budget dictated reduced quality in many choices, endurance preferred over luxury or eye appeal. Compromise and, like most compromise, satisfying no one. Guild comptrollers undoubtedly had complained at the price, and present occupants still could feel irritated at shortcomings. No matter. The thing was tangible substance. It was here to be used now. Another compromise.\nThe lobby was smaller than she had expected. Some interior changes. Only about six meters long and perhaps four meters wide. Reception slot was on their right as they entered. Odrade motioned Suipol to register their party and indicated that the rest of them should wait in the open area well within striking distance of one another. Treachery had not been ruled out.\nDortujla obviously expected it. She looked resigned.\nOdrade made a careful inspection and commented on their surroundings. Plenty of comeyes but the rest of it...\nEach time she entered one of these places, she had the sensation of being in a museum. Other Memory said hostelries of this sort had not changed significantly in eons. Even in early times she found prototypes. A glimpse of the past in the chandeliers—gigantic glittering things imitative of electric devices but furnished with glowglobes. Two of them dominated the ceiling like imaginary spaceships descending in splendor from the void.\nThere were more glimpses of the past that few transients in this age would notice. The arrangement of the reception area behind grilled slots, space for waiting with its mixture of seats and inconvenient lighting, signs directing them to services—restaurants, narcoparlors, assignation bars, Swimming and other exercise facilities, automassage rooms, and the like. Only language and script had changed from ancient times. Given an understanding of the language, the\nsigns would be recognizable to pre-space primitives. This was a temporary stopping place.\nPlenty of security installations. Some had the look of artifacts from the Scattering. Ix and Guild had never wasted gold on comeyes and sensors.\nA frenetic dance of roboservants in the reception area— darting here and there, cleaning, picking up litter, guiding newcomers. A party of four Ixians had preceded Odrade’s group. She gave them close attention. How self-important yet fearful.\nTo her Bene Gesserit eye, the people of Ix were always recognizable no matter the disguises. Basic structure of their society colored its individuals. Ixians displayed a Hogbenesque attitude toward their science: that political and economic requirements determined permissible research. That said the innocent naivete of Ixian social dreams had become the reality of bureaucratic centralism— a new aristocracy. So they were headed into a decline that would not be stopped by whatever accommodation this Ixian party made with Honored Matres.\nNo matter the outcome of our contest, Ix is dying. Witness: no great Ixian innovations in centuries.\nSuipol returned. “They ask us to wait for an escort.”\nOdrade decided to start negotiations immediately with a chat for the benefit of Suipol, the comeyes, and listeners on her no-ship.\n“Suipol, did you notice those Ixians ahead of us?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior.”\n“Mark them well. They are products of a dying society. It is naive to expect any bureaucracy to take brilliant innovations and put them to good use. Bureaucracies ask different questions. Do you know what those are?”\n“No, Mother Superior.” Spoken after a searching look at their surroundings.\nShe knows! But she sees what I’m doing. What have we here? I’ve misjudged her.\n“These are typical questions, Suipol: Who gets the credit? Who will be blamed if it causes problems? Will it shift the power structure, costing us jobs? Or will it make some subsidiary department more important?”\nSuipol nodded on cue but her glance at the comeyes might have been a little obvious. No matter.\n“These are political questions,” Odrade said. “They demonstrate how motives of bureaucracy are directly opposed to the need for adapting to change. Adaptability is a prime requirement for life to survive.”\nTime to talk directly to our hosts.\nOdrade turned her attention upward, picking a prominent comeye in a chandelier. “Note those Ixians. Their ‘mind ina deterministic universe’ has given way to ‘mind in an unlimited universe’ where anything may happen. Creative anarchy is the path to survival in this universe.”\n“Thank you for this lesson, Mother Superior.”\nBless you, Suipol.\n“After all of their experiences with us,” Suipol said, “surely they no longer question our loyalty to one another.”\nFates preserve her! This one Is ready for the Agony and may never see it.\nOdrade could only agree with the acolyte’s summation. Compliance with Bene Gesserit ways came from within, from those constantly monitored details that kept their own house in order. It was not philosophical but a pragmatic view of free will. Any claim the Sisterhood might have to making its own way in a hostile universe lay in scrupulous adherence to mutual loyalty, an agreement forged in the Agony. Chapterhouse and its few remaining subsidiaries were nurseries of an order founded in sharing and Sharing. Not based on innocence. That had been lost long ago. It was set firmly in political consciousness and a view of history independent of other laws and customs.\n“We are not machines,” Odrade said, glancing at the automata around them. “We always rely on personal\nrelationships, never knowing where those may lead us.” Tamalane stepped to Odrade’s side. “Don’t you think they should be sending us a message at the very least?” “They've already sent us a message, Tam, putting us up in a second-class hostelry. And | have responded.”\nUltimately, all things are known because you want to believe you know.\n—ZENSUNNI KOAN\nTe took a deep breath. Gamm u lay directly ahead, precisely where his navigators had said it would be when they emerged from foldspace. He stood beside a watchful Streggi seeing this in displays of his flagship’s command bay.\nStreggi did not like it that he stood on his own feet instead of riding her shoulders. She felt superfluous amidst military hardware. Her gaze kept going to the multi- projection fields at command bay center. Aides moving efficiently in and out of pods and fields, bodies draped with esoteric hardware, knew what they were doing. She had only the vaguest idea of these functions.\nThe comboard to relay Teg’s orders lay under his palms, riding there on suspensors. Its command field formed a faint blue glow around his hands. The silvery horseshoe linking him to the attack force rested lightly on his shoulders, feeling familiar there in spite of being much larger relative to his small body than comlinks of his previous lifetime.\nNone of those around him any longer questioned that this was their famous Bashar in a child’s body. They took his orders with brisk acceptance.\nThe target system looked ordinary from this distance: a sun and its captive planets. But Gammu in center focus was not ordinary. Idaho had been born there, his ghola trained there, his original memories restored there.\nAnd I was changed there.\nTeg had no explanation for what he had found in himself under the stresses of survival on Gammu. Physical speed that drained his flesh and an ability to see no-ships, to locate them in an image field like a block of space reproduced in his mind.\nHe suspected a wild outcropping in Atreides genes. Marker cells had been identified in him but not their purpose. It was the heritage Bene Gesserit Breeding Mistresses had meddled with for eons. There was little doubt they would view this ability as something potentially dangerous to them. They might use it but he would certainly lose his freedom.\nHe put these reflections out of his mind.\n“Send in the decoys.”\nAction!\nTeg felt himself assume a familiar stance. There was a sense of climbing onto a refreshing eminence when planning ended. Theories had been articulated, alternatives carefully worked out, and subordinates deployed, all thoroughly briefed. His key squad leaders had committed Gammu to memory—where partisan help might be available, every bolt hole, every known strongpoint and which access routes were most vulnerable. He had warned them especially about Futars. The possibility that humanoid beasts might be allies could not be overlooked. Rebels who had helped ghola-ldaho escape from Gammu had insisted Futars were created to hunt and kill Honored Matres. Knowing the accounts of Dortujla and others, you could almost pity Honored Matres if this were true, except that no pity could be spared for those who never showed it to others.\nThe attack was taking its designed shape—scout ships laying down a decoy barrage and heavy carriers moving into strike position. Teg became now what he thought of as “the instrument of my instruments.” It was difficult to determine which", " onto a refreshing eminence when planning ended.

Teg became now what he thought of as “the instrument of my instruments.” It was difficult to determine which commanded and which responded.\nNow, the delicate part.\nUnknowns were to be feared. A good commander kept that firmly in mind. There were always unknowns.\nDecoys were nearing the defensive perimeter. He saw enemy no-ships and foldspace sensors—bright dots arrayed through his awareness. Teg superimposed this onto the positions of his force. Every order he gave must appear to originate from a battle-plot they all shared.\nHe felt thankful Murbella had not joined him. Any Reverend Mother might see through his deception. But no one had questioned Odrade’s order that Murbella wait with her party at a safe distance.\n“Potential Mother Superior. Guard this one well.”\nExplosive demolition of decoys began with a random display of brilliant flashes around the planet. He leaned forward, staring at projections.\n“There’s the pattern!”\nThere was no such pattern but his words created belief and pulses quickened. No one questioned that the Bashar had seen vulnerability in the defenses. His hands flashed over the comboard, sending his ships forward in a blazing display that littered space behind them with enemy fragments.\n“All right! Let’s go!”\nHe fed the flagship’s course directly into Navigation, then turned full attention to Fire Control. Silent explosions dotted Space around them as the flagship mopped up surviving elements of Gammu’s perimeter guardians.\n“More decoys!” he ordered.\nGlobes of white light blinked in the projection fields.\nAttention in the command bay concentrated on the fields, not on their Bashar. The unexpected! Teg, justly famous for that, was confirming his reputation.\n“I find this oddly romantic,” Streggi said.\nRomantic? No romance in this! The time for romance was past and yet to come. A certain aura might surround plans\nfor violence. He accepted that. Historians created their own brand of drama-cum-romance. But now? This was adrenaline time! Romance distracted you from necessities. You had to be cold inside, a clear and unimpaired line between mind and body.\nAs his hands moved in the comboard’s field, Teg realized what had driven Streggi to speak. Something primitive about the death and destruction being created here. This was a moment cut out of normal order. A disturbing return to ancient tribal patterns.\nShe sensed a tom-tom in her breast and voices chanting: “Kill! KIN! KIN!”\nHis vision of guardian no-ships showed survivors fleeing in panic.\nGood! Panic has a way of spreading and weakening your enemies.\n“There’s Barony.”\nIdaho had converted him to the old Harkonnen name for the sprawling city with its giant black centerpiece of plasteel.\n“We'll land on the Flat to the north.”\nHe spoke the words but his hands gave the orders.\nQuickly now!\nFor brief moments when they disgorged troops, no-ships were visible and vulnerable. He held elements of the entire force responsive to his comboard and responsibility was heavy.\n“This is only a feint. We go in and out after inflicting serious damage. Junction is our real target.”\nOdrade’s parting admonition lay there in memory. “Honored Matres must be taught a lesson such as never before. Attack us and you get hurt badly. Press us and the pain can be enormous. They’ve heard about Bene Gesserit punishments. We're notorious. No doubt Spider Queen Sniggered a bit. You must shove that snigger down her throat!”\n“Quit ship!”\nThis was the vulnerable moment. Space above them remained empty of threat but fire lances arced inward from the east. His gunners could handle those. He concentrated on the possibility that enemy no-ships might return for a suicide attack. Command bay projections showed his hammerships and troop carriers pouring from the holds. The shock force, an armored elite on suspensors, already had the perimeter secured.\nThere went the portable comeyes to spread his field of observation and relay the intimate details of violence. Communication, the key to responsive command, but it also displayed bloody destruction.\n“All clear!”\nThe signal rang through the bay.\nHe lifted off the Flat and repositioned in full invisibility. Now, only the comlinks gave defenders a clue to his position and that was masked by decoy relays.\nProjection displayed the monstrous rectangle of the ancient Harkonnen center. It had been built as a block of light-absorbing metal to confine slaves. The elite had lived in garden mansions on top. Honored Matres had returned it to its former oppression.\nThree of his giant hammerships came into view.\n“Clear the top of that thing!” he ordered. “Wipe it clean but do as little damage as possible to the structure.”\nHe knew his words were superfluous but spoke for the release. Everyone in the attack force knew what he wanted.\n“Relay reports!” he ordered.\nInformation began flowing from the horseshoe on his shoulders. He brought it up on secondary. Comeyes showed his troops clearing the perimeter. Battle overhead and on the ground was well in hand for at least fifty klicks out. Going far better than he had expected. So Honored Matres kept their heavy stuff off-planet, not anticipating bold\nattack. A familiar attitude and he had Idaho to thank for predicting it.\n“They're power-blind. They think heavy armor is for space and only light stuff for the ground. Heavy weapons are brought down as needed. No sense keeping them on planet. Takes too much energy. Besides, awareness of all that heavy stuff up there has a quieting effect on captive populations.”\nIdaho’s concepts of weaponry were devastating.\n“We tend to fix our minds on what we believe we know. A projectile is a projectile even when miniaturized to contain poisons or biologicals.”\nInnovations in protective equipment improved mobility. Built into uniforms where possible. And Idaho had brought back the shield with its awesome destruction when struck by a lasgun beam. Shields on suspensors hidden in what appeared to be soldiers (but were actually inflated uniforms) spread out ahead of troops. Lasgun fire at them produced clean atomics to clear large areas.\nWill Junction be this easy?\nTeg doubted it. Necessity enforced quick adaptation to new methods.\nThey could have shields on Junction in two days.\nAnd no inhibitions about how to employ them.\nShields had dominated the Old Empire, he knew, because of that oddly important set of words called “Great Convention.” Honorable people did not misuse weapons of their feudal society. If you dishonored the Convention, your peers turned against you with united violence. More than that, there had been the intangible, “Face,” that some called “Pride.”\nFace! My position in the pack.\nMore important to some than life itself.\n“This is costing us very little,” Streggi said.\nShe was becoming quite the battle analyst and much too banal for Teg’s liking. Streggi meant they were losing few lives but perhaps she spoke truer than she knew.\n“It’s difficult to think of cheap devices doing the job,” Idaho had said. “But that’s a powerful weapon.”\nIf your weapons cost only a small fraction of the energy your enemy spent, you had a potent lever that could prevail against seemingly overwhelming odds. Prolong the conflict and you wasted enemy substance. Your foe toppled because control of production and workers was lost.\n“We can begin to pull out,” he said turning away from the projections as his hands repeated the order. “I want casualty reports as soon as—” He broke off and turned at a sudden Stir.\nMurbella?\nHer projection was repeated in all of the bay’s fields. Her voice blared from the images: “Why are you disregarding reports from your perimeter?” She overrode his board and the projections displayed a field commander caught in mid- sentence: “...orders, | will have to deny their request.”\n“Repeat,” Murbella said.\nThe field commander’s sweaty features turned toward his mobile comeye. The comsystem compensated and he appeared to look directly into Teg’s eyes.\n“Repeating: | have self-styled refugees here asking for asylum. Their leader says he has an agreement requiring the Sisterhood to honor his request but without orders...”\n“Who is he?” Teg demanded.\n“He calls himself Rabbi.”\nTeg moved to resume control of his comboard. “I don’t know of any—”\n“Wait!” Murbella overrode his board.\nHow does she do that?\nAgain her voice filled the bay. “Bring him and his party to the flagship. Make it quick.” She silenced the perimeter relay.\nTeg was outraged but at a disadvantage. He chose one of the multiple images and glared at it. “How dare you interfere?”\n“Because you don’t have the proper data. The Rabbi is within his rights. Prepare to receive him with honors.”\n“Explain.”\n“No! There’s no need for you to know. But it was proper for me to make this decision when | saw you were not responding.”\n“That commander was in a diversionary area! Not important to—”\n“But the Rabbi’s request has priority.”\n“You're as bad as Mother Superior!”\n“Perhaps worse. Now hear me! Get those refugees into your flagship. And prepare to receive me.”\n“Absolutely not! You are to stay where you are!”\n“Bashar! There’s something about this request that demands a Reverend Mother’s attention. He says they are in peril because they gave temporary sanctuary to the Reverend Mother Lucilla. Accept this or step down.”\n“Then let me get my people aboard and pull back first. We'll rendezvous when we're clear.”\n“Agreed. But treat those refugees with courtesy.”\n“Now, get off my projections. You’ve blinded me and that was foolish!”\n“You have everything well in hand, Bashar. During this hiatus another of our ships accepted four Futars. They came asking that we take them to Handlers but | ordered them confined. Treat them with extreme caution.”\nThe bay’s projections resumed battle status. Teg once more called in his force. He was seething and it was minutes before he restored a sense of command. Did Murbella know how she undermined his authority? Or should he take this as a measure of the importance she attached to the refugees?\nWhen the situation was secure, he turned the bay over to an aide and, riding on Streggi’s shoulders, went to see these important refugees. What was so vital about them that Murbella risked interference?\nThey were in a troop-carrier hold, a congealed party held apart by a cautious commander.\nWho knows what may be concealed among these unknowns?\nThe Rabbi, identifiable because he was being deferred to by the field commander, stood with a brown-robed woman at the near side of his people. He was a small, bearded man wearing a white skullcap. Cold light made him appear ancient. The woman shielded her eyes with a hand. The Rabbi was speaking and his words became audible as Teg approached.\nThe woman was under verbal attack!\n“The prideful one will be brought low", " a sense of command.

The Rabbi was speaking and his words became audible as Teg approached.\nThe woman was under verbal attack!\n“The prideful one will be brought low!”\nWithout removing her hand from its defensive position, the woman said: “I am not proud of what | carry.”\n“Nor of the powers this knowledge may bring you?”\nWith knee pressure, Teg ordered Streggi to stop them about ten paces away. His commander glanced at Teg but stayed in position, ready to act defensively if this should prove to be a diversion.\nGood man.\nThe woman bent her head even lower and pressed her hand against her eyes when she spoke. “Are we not offered knowledge that we might use it in holy service?”\n“Daughter!” The Rabbi held himself stiffly erect. “Whatever we may learn that we may better serve, it never can be a great thing. All we call knowledge, were it to encompass everything a humble heart could hold, all of that would be no more than one seed in the furrows.”\nTeg felt reluctant to interfere. What an archaic way of speaking. This pair fascinated him. The other refugees listened to the exchange with rapt attention. Only Teg’s field commander appeared aloof, keeping his attention on the strangers and giving an occasional hand-signal to aides.\nThe woman kept her head respectfully lowered and the Shielding hand in place but she still defended herself. “Even\na seed lost in the furrows may bring forth life.”\nThe Rabbi's lips tightened into a grim line, then: “Without water and care, which is to say, without the blessing and the word, there is no life.”\nA great sigh shook the woman’s shoulders but she held herself in that oddly submissive position when she responded: “Rabbi, | hear and obey. Still, | must honor this knowledge that has been thrust upon me because it contains the very admonition you have just voiced.”\nThe Rabbi placed a hand on her shoulder. “Then convey it to those who want it and may no evil enter where you go.”\nSilence told Teg the argument had ended. He urged Streggi forward. Before she could move, Murbella strode past and nodded to the Rabbi while keeping her gaze on the woman.\n“In the name of the Bene Gesserit and our debt to you, | welcome you and give you sanctuary,” Murbella said.\nThe brown-robed woman lowered her hand and Teg saw contact lenses glittering in the palm. She lifted her head then and there were gasps all around. The woman’s eyes were the total blue of spice addiction but they also held that inner force marking one who had survived the Agony.\nMurbella made instant identification. A wild Reverend Mother! Not since Dune’s Fremen days had one of these been known.\nThe woman curtsied to Murbella. “I am called Rebecca. And | am filled with joy to be with you. The Rabbi thinks | am a silly goose but I have a golden egg for | carry Lampadas: seven million six hundred twenty-two thousand and fourteen Reverend Mothers and they are rightfully yours.”\nAnswers are a perilous grip on the universe. They can appear sensible yet explain nothing.\n—THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\ns the wait for their promised escort lengthened, Odrade\nbecame first angry and then amused. Finally, she began following lobby robos, interfering with their movements. Most were small and none appeared humanoid.\nFunctional. Hallmark of Ixian servos. Busy, busy, busy little accompaniments to a sojourn at Junction or its equivalent anywhere.\nThey were so commonplace that few people noticed them. Since they were not capable of dealing with deliberate interference, they subsided into motionless humming.\n“Honored Matres have little or no sense of humor.” | know, Murbella. | know. But do they get my message?\nDortujla obviously did. She came out of her funk and watched these antics with a wide grin. Tam looked disapproving but tolerant. Suipol was delighted. Odrade had to restrain her from helping to immobilize the devices.\nLet me do the antagonizing, child. | know what is in store for me.\nWhen she was sure she had made her point, Odrade took a position under one of the chandeliers.\n“Attend me, Tam,” she said.\nTamalane obediently placed herself in front of Odrade with an attentive expression.\n“Have you noticed, Tam, that modern lobbies tend to be quite small?”\nTamalane spared a glance for her surroundings.\n“Lobbies once were large,” Odrade said. “To provide a prestigious feeling of space for the powerful, and impressing others with your importance, of course.”\nTamalane caught the spirit of Odrade’s playlet and said: “These days you’re important if you travel at all.”\nOdrade looked at the immobilized robos scattered across the lobby floor. Some hummed and jittered. Others waited quietly for someone or some thing to restore order.\nThe autoreceptionist, a phallic tube of black plaz with a single glittering comeye, came out from behind its cage and picked its way through the stalled robos to confront Odrade.\n“Much too humid today.” It had a soupy feminine voice. “Don’t know what Weather is thinking of.”\nOdrade spoke past it to Tamalane. “Why do they have to program these mechanicals to simulate friendly humans?”\n“It’s obscene,” Tamalane agreed. She forcibly shouldered the autoreceptionist aside and it swiveled to study the source of this intrusion but made no other move.\nOdrade was suddenly aware she had touched on the force that had powered the Butlerian Jinhad—mob motivation.\nMy own prejudice!\nShe studied the mechanical confronting them. Was it waiting for instructions or must she address the thing directly?\nFour more robos entered the lobby and Odrade recognized her party’s luggage piled on them.\nAll of our things carefully inspected, I’m sure. Search where you will. We carry no hint of our legions.\nThe four scurried along the edge of the room and found their passage blocked by the ones rendered motionless. The luggage robos stopped and waited for this unique state of affairs to be sorted out. Odrade smiled at them. “There go the signs of the transient concealing our secret selves.”\nConcealing and secret.\nWords to annoy the watchers.\nCome on, Tam! You know the ploy. Confuse that enormous content of unconsciousness, arouse feelings of guilt they will be incapable of recognizing. Give them the jitters the way | did with the robos. Make them wary. What are the real powers of these Bene Gesserit witches?\nTamalane took her cue. Transients and secret selves. She explained for the comeyes in tones one used with children. “What do you carry when you leave your nest? Are you one who tries to pack it all? Or do you prune to necessities?”\nWhat would the watchers classify as necessities? Tools of hygiene and washable or replaceable clothing? Weapons? They sought those in our luggage. But Reverend Mothers tend not to carry visible weapons.\n“What an ugly place this is,” Dortujla said, joining Tamalane in front of Odrade and picking up on the drama. “You would almost think it deliberate.”\nAhhh, you nasty watchers. Observe Dortujla. Remember her? Why has she returned when she must know what you might do to her? Food for Futars? See how little that concerns her?\n“A transition point, Dortujla,” Odrade said. “Most people would never want this as their destination. An inconvenience, and the small discomforts serve only to remind you of that.”\n“A wayside stop, and it will never be much more unless they completely rebuild,” Dortujla said.\nWould they hear? Odrade aimed a look of utter composure at the selected comeye.\nThis is ugliness that betrays intent. It says to us: “We will provide something for the stomach, a bed, a place to evacuate bladder and bowels, a place to conduct the little maintenance rituals flesh requires, but you will be gone quickly because all we really want is the energy you leave behind.”\nThe autoreceptionist backed around Tamalane and Dortujla, once more trying to make contact with Odrade.\n“You will send us to our quarters immediately!” Odrade said, glaring into the cyclopean eye.\n“Dear me! We’ve been inconsiderate.”\nWhere had they found that syrupy voice? Repulsive. But Odrade was on her way out of the lobby in less than a minute, luggage on its robos ahead of them, Suipol close behind, Tamalane and Dortujla following.\nThere was an air of neglect to one wing clearly visible as they passed it. Did that mean Junction’s traffic had declined? Interesting. Shutters had been sealed along an entire corridor. Hiding something? In the resulting gloom she detected dust on floor and ledges with only a few tracks of maintenance mechs. Concealment of what lay outside those windows? Unlikely. This had been closed off for some time.\nShe detected a pattern in what was being maintained. Very little traffic. Honored Matre effect. Who dared move around much when it felt safer to dig in and pray you would not be noticed by dangerous prowlers? Access lanes to elite private quarters were being kept up. Only the best was being maintained at its best.\nWhen Gammu’s refugees arrive, there will be room.\nIn the lobby, a robo had handed Suipol a guide pulser. “To find your way later.” Round blue ball with a yellow arrow floating in it to point your chosen way. “Rings a tiny bell when you arrive.”\nThe pulser’s tiny bell rang.\nAnd where have we arrived?\nAnother place where their hosts had provided “every luxury” while keeping it repellent. Rooms with soft yellow floors, pale mauve walls, white ceilings. No chairdogs. Be thankful for that even though the absence spoke of economics rather than care for a guest’s preferences. Chairdogs required sustenance and expensive staff. She saw furnishings with permaflox fabrics. And behind the fabrics She felt plastic resilience. Everything done in the other colors of the rooms.\nThe bed was a small shock. Someone had taken the request for a hard mat too literally. Flat surface of black plaz without cushion. No bedding.\nSuipol, seeing this, started to object but Odrade silenced her. Despite Bene Gesserit resources, comfort sometimes fell by the wayside. Get the job done! That was their first order. If Mother Superior had to sleep occasionally on a hard surface without covers, this could be passed off in the name of duty. Besides, the Bene Gesserit had ways of adjusting to such inconsequentials. Odrade steeled herself to discomfort, aware that if she objected she might find another deliberate insult.\nLet them add this to all of that unconscious content and worry about it.\nHer summons came while she was inspecting the rest of their"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_a91d4e9cce9cc268ea1d6c02476f1016617110c8dfe81eb70e0199ce90a4f38d_v2"}
