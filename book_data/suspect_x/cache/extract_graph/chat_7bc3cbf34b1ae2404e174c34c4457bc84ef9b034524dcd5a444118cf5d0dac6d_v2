We welcome it because it keeps us on our toes.”\n“And you'll watchdog me if | become a Reverend Mother?”\n“We want our watchdogs. We’d be weaker without them.”\n“It sounds oppressive.”\n“We don’t find it so.”\n“I think it’s repellent.” She looked at the glittering lenses in the ceiling. “Like those damned comeyes.”\n“We take care of our own, Murbella. Once you’re a Bene Gesserit, you’re assured of lifelong maintenance.”\n“A comfortable niche.” Sneering.\nOdrade spoke softly. “Something quite different. You are challenged throughout your life. You repay the Sisterhood right up to the limits of your abilities.”\n“Watchdogs!”\n“We're always mindful of one another. Some of us in positions of power can be authoritarian at times, familiar even, but only to a point carefully measured for the requirements of the moment.”\n“Never really warm or tender, eh?”\n“That’s the rule.”\n“Affection, maybe, but no love?”\n“I’ve told you the rule.” And Odrade could see the reaction clearly on Murbella’s face: “There it is! They will demand that I give up Duncan!”\n“So there’s no love among the Bene Gesserit.” How sad her tone. There was hope for Murbella yet.\n“Loves occur,” Odrade said, “but my Sisters treat them as aberrations.”\n“So what | feel for Duncan is aberration?”\n“And Sisters will try to treat it.”\n“Treat! Apply correctional therapy to the afflicted!”\n“Love is considered a sign of rot in Sisters.”\n“I see signs of rot in you!”\nAs though she followed Odrade’s thoughts, Bellonda dragged Odrade out of reverie. “That Honored Matre will never commit herself to us!” Bellonda wiped a bit of luncheon gravy from the corner of her mouth. “We’re wasting our time trying to teach her our ways.”\nAt least Bell was no longer calling Murbella “whore,” Odrade thought. That was an improvement.\nAll governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted.\n—MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA, TEXT QIV (DECTO)\nPe eee knelt on the yellow tile floor as she had been ordered to do, not daring to look up at Great Honored Matre seated so remotely high, so dangerous. Two hours Rebecca had waited here almost in the center of a giant room while Great Honored Matre and her companions ate a lunch served by obsequious attendants. Rebecca marked the manners of the attendants with care and emulated them.\nHer eye sockets still ached from transplants the Rabbi had given her less than a month ago. These eyes showed a blue iris and white sclera, no clue to the Spice Agony in her past. It was a temporary defense. In less than a year, the new eyes would betray her with total blue.\nShe judged the ache in her eyes to be the least of her problems. An organic implant fed her metered doses of melange, concealing her dependence. The supply was gauged to last about sixty days. If these Honored Matres held her longer than that, withdrawal would plunge her into an agony that would make the original appear mild by comparison. The most immediately dangerous thing was the shere being metered to her with the spice. If these women detected it, they certainly would be suspicious.\nYou are doing well. Be patient. That was Other Memory from the horde of Lampadas. The voice rang softly in her\nhead. It had the sound of Lucilla but Rebecca could not be sure.\nIt had become a familiar voice in the months since the Sharing when it had announced itself as “Speaker of your Mohalata.” These whores cannot match our knowledge. Remember that and let it give you courage.\nThe presence of Others Within who subtracted none of her attention from what went on around her had filled her with awe. We call it Simulflow, Speaker had said. Simulflow multiplies your awareness. When she had tried to explain this to the Rabbi, he had reacted in anger.\n“You have been tainted by unclean thoughts!”\nThey had been in the Rabbi’s study late at night. “Stealing time from the days alloted us,” he called it. The study was an underground room, its walls lined with old books, ridulian crystals, scrolls. The room was protected from probes by the best Ixian devices and they had been modified by his own people to improve them.\nShe was allowed to sit beside his desk at such times while he leaned back in an old chair. A glowglobe placed low beside him cast an antique yellow light on his bearded face, glinting off the spectacles he wore almost as a badge of office.\nRebecca pretended confusion. “But you said it was required of us to save this treasure from Lampadas. Have the Bene Gesserit not been honorable with us?”\nShe saw the worry in his eyes. “You heard Levi talking yesterday of the questions being asked here. Why did the Bene Gesserit witch come to us? That is what they ask.”\n“Our story is consistent and believable,” Rebecca protested. “The Sisters have taught us ways that even Truthsay cannot penetrate.”\n“I don’t know... I don’t know.” The Rabbi shook his head sadly. “What is a lie? What is truth? Do we condemn ourselves with our own mouths?”\n“It is pogrom that we resist, Rabbi!” That usually stiffened his resolve.\n“Cossacks! Yes, you are right, daughter. There have been cossacks in every age and we are not the only ones who have felt their knouts and swords as they rode into the village with murder in their hearts.”\nIt was odd, Rebecca thought, how he managed to give the impression that these events were of recent occurrence and that his eyes had seen them. Never to forgive, never to forget. Lidiche was yesterday. What a powerful thing that was in the memory of Secret Israel. Pogrom! Almost as powerful in its continuity as these Bene Gesserit presences she carried in her awareness. Almost. That was the thing the Rabbi resisted, she told herself.\n“| fear that you have been taken from us,” the Rabbi said. “What have | done to you? What have | done? And all in the name of honor.”\nHe looked at the instruments on his study wall that reported the nightly power accumulations from the vertical- axis windmills placed around the farmstead. The instruments said the machines were humming away up there, storing energy for the morrow. That was a gift of the Bene Gesserit: freedom from Ix. Independence. What a peculiar word.\nWithout looking at Rebecca, he said: “I find this thing of Other Memory very difficult and always have. Memory should bring wisdom but it does not. It is how we order the memory and where we apply our knowledge.”\nHe turned and looked at her, his face falling into shadows. “What is it this one inside you says? This one you think of as Lucilla?”\nRebecca could see it pleased him to say Lucilla’s name. If Lucilla could speak through a daughter of Secret Israel, then She still lived and had not been betrayed.\nRebecca lowered her gaze as she spoke. “She says we have these inner images, sounds and sensations that come\nat command or intrude under necessity.”\n“Necessity, yes! And what is that except reports of senses from flesh that may have been where you should not have been and done offensive things?”\nOther bodies, other memories, Rebecca thought. Having experienced this she knew she could never willingly abandon it. Perhaps I have indeed become Bene Gesserit. That is what he fears, of course.\n“ĮI will tell you a thing,” the Rabbi said. “This ‘crucial intersection of living awareness,’ as they call it, that is nothing unless you know how your own decisions go out from you like threads into the lives of others.”\n“To see our own actions in the reactions of others, yes, that is how the Sisters view it.”\n“That is wisdom. What is it the lady says they seek?”\n“Influence on the maturing of humankind.”\n“Mmmmmm. And she finds that events are not beyond her influence, merely beyond her senses. That is almost wise. But maturity ... ahhh, Rebecca. Do we interfere with a higher plan? Is it the right of humans to set limits on the nature of Yaweh? | think Leto Il understood that. This lady in you denies it.”\n“She says he was a damnable tyrant.”\n“He was but there have been wise tyrants before him and doubtless will be more after us.”\n“They call him Shaitan.”\n“He had Satan’s own powers. | share their fear of that. He was not so much prescient as he was a cement. He fixed the Shape of what he saw.”\n“That is what the lady says. But she says it is their grail that he preserved.”\n“Again, they are almost wise.”\nA great sigh shook the Rabbi and once more he looked to the instruments on his wall. Energy for the morrow.\nHe returned his attention to Rebecca. She was changed. He could not avoid awareness of it. She had become very\nlike the Bene Gesserit. It was understandable. Her mind was filled with all of those people from Lampadas. But they were not Gadarene swine to be driven into the sea and their diabolism with them. And / am not another Jesus.\n“This thing they tell you about the Mother Superior Odrade—that she often damns her own Archivists and the Archives with them. What a thing! Are not Archives like the books in which we preserve our wisdom?”\n“Then am | an Archivist, Rabbi?”\nHer question confounded him but it also illuminated the problem. He smiled. “I tell you something, daughter. | admit to a little sympathy with this Odrade. There is always something grumbling about Archivists.”\n“Is that wisdom, Rabbi?” How shyly she asked it!\n“Believe me, daughter, it is. How carefully the Archivist Suppresses even the smallest hint of judgment. One word after another. Such arrogance!”\n“How do they judge which words to use, Rabbi?”\n“Ahhh, a bit of wisdom comes to you, daughter. But these Bene Gesserit have not achieved wisdom and it is their grail that prevents it.”\nShe could see it on his face. He tries to arm me with doubts about these lives | carry.\n“Let me tell you a thing about the Bene Gesserit,” he said. Nothing came into his mind then. No words, no sage advice. This had not happened to him for years. There was only one course open to him: speak from the heart.\n“Perhaps they have been too long on the road to Damascus without a blinding flash of illumination, Rebecca. | hear them say they act for the benefit of humankind. Somehow, | cannot see this in them, nor do | believe the Tyrant saw it.”\nWhen Rebecca started to reply, he stopped her with an upraised hand. “Mature humanity? That is their grail? Is it not the mature fruit that is plucked and eaten?”\nOn the floor of Junction’s Great Hall, Rebecca remembered these words, seeing the personification of them not in the lives she preserved but in the actions of her captors.\nGreat Honored Matre had finished eating. She wiped her hands on the gown of an attendant.\n“Let her approach,” Great Honored Matre said.\nPain lanced Rebecca’s left shoulder and she lurched forward on her knees. The one called Logno had come up behind with the stealth of a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7bc3cbf34b1ae2404e174c34c4457bc84ef9b034524dcd5a444118cf5d0dac6d_v2"}
