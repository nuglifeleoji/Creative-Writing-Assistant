While some descriptions refer to it as part of a planned trilogy Herbert began before his death, others emphasize its position as the fifth installment in the broader series. The book continues the expansive narrative of the *Dune* universe, exploring themes of power, religion, and evolution in a distant future where humanity has spread across the cosmos.
