蓝轩宇用身体挡住火球给钱磊争取时间的一幕刺激的刘锋热血沸腾，他大叫一声，身上魂环光芒再放，猛然一步跨出，白龙枪横扫上挑，竟是一下将七八只熔岩犬都挑了起来，这些熔岩犬被他挑飞上天，他自己也因为用力过度一屁股坐倒在地，最后一点力气也似乎消耗殆尽了。\n\n    而就在这时，那召唤之门内，一抹银光涌出，奇异的一幕出现了。\n\n    一只纤纤玉足从门内跨出，随之一道纤细的身影也从中走了出来。\n\n    她的身材不高但却修长挺拔，竟然不是魂兽，而是一名相貌极美的绝色少女。\n\n    白色长裙遮盖住身体，看上去不过和蓝轩宇他们差不多的年纪，深蓝色的长发在脑后梳拢成马尾，深蓝色的眼眸仿佛大海一般深邃。\n\n    刚刚跨出召唤之门的她，明显有些茫然，然后她就看到，那些熔岩犬恶形恶状的扑了上来。\n\n    “啊！”少女尖叫一声，双手抬起猛的向外推出，顿时，一片厚重的冰墙瞬间凝聚，直接将身前冲来的熔岩犬撞击的飞了出去。\n\n    蓝轩宇、钱磊和刘锋都看呆了。这召唤之门不止能召唤魂兽，竟然连人也能召唤的出来吗？\n\n    这都什么情况啊？\n\n    只有蓝轩宇隐隐感觉到，这召唤的变化似乎和自己用左手抓住召唤之门有关系。\n\n    那少女眼看将熔岩犬击退，这才松了口气，然后疑惑的看向周围，自然首先注意到的就是同为人类的三人。\n\n    “这是哪里？你们是谁？”\n\n    钱磊怪叫一声，兴奋的跳过来，“哇，你好漂亮。先杀敌，我的召唤美女，先把这些熔岩犬都杀掉，咱们然后再说。”\n\n    少女眉头微蹙，“我为什么要听你的？”\n\n    钱磊一副理所应当的道：“因为我是你的宿主啊！是我用召唤之门把你召唤来的。”\n\n    少女呆呆的道：“可这是哪里？我怎么回去呀？”\n\n    钱磊道：“召唤结束你就回去了，这里是斗罗世界，估计你是来自异世界的生物吧。说了你也不知道。”\n\n    “斗罗世界？你说那个模拟舱里的世界吗？”少女的下一句话令钱磊三人目瞪口呆。\n\n    蓝轩宇惊讶的道：“你知道？”\n\n
