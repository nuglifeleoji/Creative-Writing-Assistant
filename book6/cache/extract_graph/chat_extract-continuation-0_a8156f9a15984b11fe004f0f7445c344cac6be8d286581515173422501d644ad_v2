最大的人造物体，其中可以常驻上千人。\n　　①太空电梯实是一颗运行于地球同步轨道的人造卫星，为了在运行中取得平衡，需要在轨道的外侧加上与电梯同等的重。\n　　以太空电梯为圆心，在半径五百公里的范围内还有其他太空的设施，规模都比黄河站小许多，它们零星地散落着，像美国西部开发初期大草原上的游牧帐篷，这是人类大规模进入太空的前奏。其中刚刚开始建造的太空船坞是规模最大的，其体积可能是黄河站的十倍，但目前只搭起了一个施工框架，像一架巨兽的骨骼；在距章北海八十公里的远处，有一个独立的空间站，规模只有黄河站的五分之一，那是太空军在同步轨道上建立的第一个基地，章北海就是从那里飞来的。现在，他已经同增援未来第一特遣队的其他成员在那里生活和工作了三个月，其间只返回过地面一次。\n　　在一号基地中，章北海一直在等待机会，现在机会出现了：航天系统在黄河站召开一次高层工作会议，他要消灭的三个目标都是与会者。黄河空间站投入使用后，航天系统的许多会议都在其中召开，好像是要弥补以前从事航天事业的人大都没机会进入太空的遗憾。\n　　在从一号基地飞出前，章北海把航天服上的定位单元留在了基地中自己的舱室内，这样，一号基地的监测系统不会知道他已经离开基地，他的这次外出不会留下任何记录。用航天服上的小型喷射推进器，他在太空飞行了十公里，来到了这个早已选定的位置，静静地等待着。\n　　章北海知道，现在会议已经结束，他在等待着全体与会者出来照像。\n　　这是一个惯例，与会者都要到太空中拍合影。一般来说，拍照应该是逆着阳光的，因为这样才能把作为背景的空间站拍清楚，在拍照时，合影的每个人需要把航天头盔面罩调成透明的，以便从面罩中露出脸来，这时如果太阳在正空，强烈的阳光会使人睁不开眼，同时也会使头盔内部很快就热得难受，所以，拍合影的时间最好是在太阳从地球边缘升起或落下的时刻。在同步轨道上，日出和日落也是每二十四小时各一次，只是夜的时间很短，章北海现在在等着日落。\n　　他知道，黄河站的监测系统肯定能检测到自己的存在，但这不会引起任何注意。在这片太空开发的起源地，散落着大量的建设材料，包括待用的和废弃的，还有更多的垃圾，这些飘浮物中，有很多大小与人体相当。另外，太空电梯与周围太空设施的关系就像大城市与周围的村庄，后者的供给完全来自前者，两者间有着繁忙的交通。随着对太空环境的适应，人们渐渐习惯了只身穿行于太空中，这时，航天服就像太空自行车，喷射推进器可以使它的时速达到五百公里\n######################\nOutput:",
