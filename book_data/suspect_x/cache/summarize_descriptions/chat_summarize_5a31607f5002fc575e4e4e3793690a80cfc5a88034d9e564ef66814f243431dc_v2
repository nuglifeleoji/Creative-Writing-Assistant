His role involves managing Leto’s entourage, overseeing the Fish Speakers' activities within the empire, and ensuring their compliance with imperial directives. MONEO frequently interacts with the Fish Speakers, observing their conduct during significant events, such as the bridge gatherings, where their duties and loyalty are on display.  \n\nHowever, tensions arise between MONEO and the Fish Speakers, particularly in relation to his involvement in arranging a wedding—a task that has displeased the Fish Speakers for reasons not explicitly stated. Despite this friction, MONEO remains a central figure in coordinating their actions and maintaining order within Leto’s regime. His authority over the Fish Speakers underscores his importance in the empire’s hierarchy, balancing enforcement with the need to manage their reactions to imperial decrees.  \n\nIn summary, MONEO acts as both a supervisor and a liaison for the Fish Speakers, ensuring their adherence to Leto’s will while navigating occasional conflicts arising from his responsibilities.
