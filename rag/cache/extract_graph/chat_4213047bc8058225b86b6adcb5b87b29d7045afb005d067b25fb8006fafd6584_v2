Did / consider the men our slaves? Perhaps. | produced in them periods of wildly unthinking abandon, a giving up to heights of ecstasy they had never dreamed possible. | was trained to give them that and, thereby, make them subject to our control.\nUntil Duncan did the same to me.\nOdrade saw the hooding of Murbella’s eyes and recognized there were things in this woman’s psyche twisted in a way difficult to uncover. Wi/dness running where we have not followed. It was as though Murbella’s original\nclarity had been stained indelibly and then that mark covered over and even this cover masked. There was a harshness in her that distorted thoughts and actions. Layer upon layer upon layer...\n“You're afraid of what I can do,” Murbella said.\n“There’s truth in what you say,” Odrade agreed.\nHonesty and candor—limited tools now to be used with care.\n“Duncan.” Murbella’s voice came out flat with new Bene Gesserit abilities.\n“| fear what you share with him. You find it odd, Mother Superior admitting fear?”\n“I know about candor and honesty!” She made candor and honesty sound repellent.\n“Reverend Mothers are taught never to abandon self. We are trained not to encumber ourselves that way with concerns of others.”\n“Is that all of it?”\n“It goes deeper and has other threads. Being Bene Gesserit marks you in its own ways.”\n“I know what you’re asking: Choose Duncan or the Sisterhood. | know your tricks.”\n“I think not.”\n“There are things | won’t do!”\n“Each of us is constrained by a past. | make my choices, do what | must because my past is different from yours.”\n“You'll continue to train me despite what I’ve just said?”\nOdrade heard this in the total receptivity these encounters with Murbella demanded, every sense alerted to things not spoken, messages that hovered on edges of words as though they were cilia wavering there, reaching for contact with a dangerous universe.\nThe Bene Gesserit must change its ways. And here is one who could guide us into change.\nBellonda would be horrified at the prospect. Many Sisters would reject it. But there it was.\nWhen Odrade remained silent, Murbella said: “Trained. Is that the proper word?”\n“Conditioned. That’s probably more familiar to you.”\n“What you really want is to conjoin our experiences, make me sufficiently like you that we can create trust between us. That’s what all education does.”\nDon't play erudite games with me, girl!\n“We would flow in the same stream, eh, Murbella?”\nAny Third-Stage acolyte would have become watchfully cautious hearing that tone from Mother Superior. Murbella appeared unmoved. “Except that | will not give him up.”\n“That is for you to decide.”\n“Did you let the Lady Jessica decide?”\nThe way out of this cul-de-sac at last.\nDuncan had prompted Murbella to study Jessica’s life. Hoping to thwart us! Holos of his performance had ignited severe analysis of records.\n“An interesting person,” Odrade said.\n“Love! After all of your teaching, your conditioning!”\n“You did not think her behavior treasonous?”\n“Never!”\nDelicately now. “But look at consequences: a Kwisatz Haderach ... and that grandchild, the Tyrant!” Argument dear to Bellonda’s heart.\n“Golden Path,” Murbella said. “Survival of humankind.”\n“Famine Times and the Scattering.”\nAre you watching this, Bell? No matter. You will watch it.\n“Honored Matres!” Murbella said.\n“All because of Jessica?” Odrade asked. “But Jessica returned to the fold and lived out her years on Caladan.”\n“Teacher of acolytes!”\n“Example to them, as well. See what happens when you defy us?” Defy us, Murbella! Do it more adroitly than Jessica.\n“Sometimes you repel me!” Natural honesty forced her to add: “But you know | want what you have.”\nWhat we have.\nOdrade recalled her own first encounters with Bene Gesserit attractions. Everything of the body done with exquisite precision, senses honed to detect smallest details, muscles trained to perform in marvelous exactitude. These abilities in an Honored Matre could only add a new dimension amplified by bodily speed.\n“You're throwing it back on me,” Murbella said. “Trying to force my choice when you already know it.”\nOdrade remained silent. This was a form of argument ancient Jesuits had almost perfected. Simulflow Superimposed disputational patterns: Let Murbella do her own convincing. Supply only the most subtle of nudges. Give her small excuses upon which to enlarge.\nBut hold fast, Murbella, to love for Duncan!\n“You're very clever at parading your Sisterhood’s advantages past me,” Murbella said.\n“We are not a cafeteria line!”\nAn insoucient grin flicked Murbella’s mouth. “lIl take one of those and one of these and | think I’d like one of those creamy things over there.”\nOdrade enjoyed the metaphor but omnipresent watchers had their own appetites. “A diet that might kill you.”\n“But | see your offerings displayed so attractively. Voice! What a marvelous thing you’ve cooked up there. | have this wonderful instrument in my throat and you can teach me to play it in that ultimate way.”\n“Now, you're a concert master.”\n“I want your ability to influence those around me!”\n“To what end, Murbella? For whose goals?”\n“If | eat what you eat, will | grow into your kind of toughness: plasteel on the outside and even harder inside?”\n“Is that how you see me?”\n“The chef at my banquet! And | must eat whatever you bring—for my good and for yours.”\nShe sounded almost manic. An odd person. Sometimes she appeared to be the most wretched of women, pacing\nher quarters like a caged beast. That mad look in her eyes, orange flecks in the corneas. ..as there were now.\n“Do you still refuse to work on Scytale?”\n“Let Sheeana do it.”\n“Will you coach her?”\n“And she will use my coaching on the child!”\nThey stared at each other, realizing they shared a similar thought. This is not confrontation because each of us wants the other.\n“lam committed to you for what you can give me,” Murbella said, her voice low. “But you want to know if | may ever act against that commitment?”\n“Could you?”\n“No more than you could if circumstances demanded it.”\n“Do you think you will ever regret your decision?”\n“Of course | will!” What kind of damnfool question was that? People always had regrets. Murbella said this.\n“Just confirming your self-honesty. We like it that you don’t fly under false colors.”\n“You get false ones?”\n“Indeed.”\n“You must have ways of weeding them out.”\n“The Agony does that for us. Falsehoods don’t come through the Spice.”\nOdrade sensed Murbella’s drumbeat flickering faster.\n“And you're not going to demand | give up Duncan?” Very spiny.\n“That attachment presents difficulties, but they are your difficulties.”\n“Another way of asking me to give him up?”\n“Accept the possibility, that is all.”\n“| can’t”\n“You won't?”\n“I mean what I say. I’m incapable.”\n“And if someone showed you how?”\nMurbella stared into Odrade’s eyes for a long beat, then: almost said that would set me free... but...”\n“Yes?”\n“I could not be free while he was bound to me.”\n“Is that renunciation of Honored Matre ways?” “Renunciation? Wrong word. I’ve merely grown beyond my former Sisters.”\n“Former Sisters?”\n“Still my Sisters, but they’re Sisters of childhood. Some | remember fondly, some | dislike intensely. Playmates ina game that no longer interests me.”\n“That decision satisfies you?”\n“Are you Satisfied, Mother Superior?”\nOdrade clapped her hands with unrestrained elation. How swiftly Murbella acquired Bene Gesserit riposte!\n“Satisfied? What a hellishly deadly word!”\nAs Odrade spoke, Murbella felt herself move as ina dream to the edge of an abyss, unable to awaken and prevent the plunge. Her stomach ached with secret emptiness and Odrade’s next words came from echoing distance.\n“The Bene Gesserit is all to a Reverend Mother. You will never be able to forget that.”\nAs quickly as it had come, the dream sensation passed. Mother Superior’s next words were cold and immediate.\n“Prepare for more advanced training.”\nUntil you meet the Agony—live or die.\nOdrade lifted her gaze to the ceiling comeyes. “Send Sheeana in here. She begins at once with her new teacher.” “So you're going to do it! You’re going to work on that\nchild.”\n“Think of him as Bashar Teg,” Odrade said. “That helps.” And we’re not giving you time to reconsider.\n“| didn’t resist Duncan and | can’t argue with you.”\n“Don’t even argue with yourself, Murbella. Pointless. Teg was my father and still | must do this.”\na“\nUntil that moment, Murbella had not realized the force behind Odrade’s earlier statement. The Bene Gesserit is all to a Reverend Mother. Great Dur protect me! Will I be like that?\nWe witness a passing phase of eternity. Important things happen but some people never notice. Accidents intervene. You are not present at episodes. You depend on reports. And people shutter their minds. What good are reports? History in a news account? Preselected at an editorial conference, digested and excreted by prejudice? Accounts you need seldom come from those who make history. Diaries, memoirs and autobiographies are subjective forms of special pleading. Archives are crammed with such suspect stuff.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nS cytale noticed the excitement of guards and others when he reached the barrier at the end of his corridor. Rapid movement of people, especially this early in the day, had attracted him first and sent him to the barrier. There went that Suk doctor, Jalanto. He recognized her from the time Odrade had sent her “because you are looking ill.” Another Reverend Mother to spy on me!\nAhhhh, Murbella’s baby. That was why this rushing around and the Suk.\nBut who were all those others? Bene Gesserit robes in an abundance he had never before seen here. Not just acolytes. Reverend Mothers outnumbered the others he saw rushing about down there. They reminded him of great carrion birds. There went an acolyte at last, carrying a child on her shoulders. Very mysterious. /f only | had a link to Shipsystems!\nHe leaned against a wall and waited but the people vanished into various hatches and doorways. Some destinations he could place with fair certainty, others remained a mystery.\nBy the Holy Prophet! There went Mother Superior herself! She went through a wider doorway where most of the others\nhad gone.\nUseless to ask Odrade when next he saw her. She had him in her trap now.\nThe Prophet is here and in powindah hands!\nWhen\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4213047bc8058225b86b6adcb5b87b29d7045afb005d067b25fb8006fafd6584_v2"}
