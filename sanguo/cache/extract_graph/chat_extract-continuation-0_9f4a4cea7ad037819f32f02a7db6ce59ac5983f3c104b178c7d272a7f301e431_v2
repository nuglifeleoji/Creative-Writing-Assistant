�打。操恐褚有失，遂令夏侯渊、曹洪两将齐出夹攻。庞德、马岱见操将齐出，麾两翼铁骑，横冲直撞，混杀将来。操兵大乱。许褚臂中两箭。诸将慌退入寨。马超直杀到壕边，操兵折伤大半。操令坚闭休出。马超回至渭口，谓韩遂曰：“吾见恶战者莫如许褚，真虎痴也！”\n\n    却说曹操料马超可以计破，乃密令徐晃、朱灵尽渡河西结营，前后夹攻。一日，操于城上见马超引数百骑，直临寨前，往来如飞。操观良久，掷兜鍪于地曰：“马儿不死，吾无葬地矣！”夏侯渊听了，心中气忿，厉声曰：“吾宁死于此地，誓灭马贼！”遂引本部千余人，大开寨门，直赶去。操急止不住，恐其有失，慌自上马前来接应。马超见曹兵至，乃将前军作后队，后队作先锋，一字儿摆开。夏侯渊到，马超接往厮杀。超于乱军中遥见曹操，就撇了夏侯渊，直取曹操。操大惊，拨马而走。曹兵大乱。\n\n    正追之际，忽报操有一军，已在河西下了营寨，超大惊，无心追赶，急收军回寨，与韩遂商议，言：“操兵乘虚已渡河西，吾军前后受敌，如之奈何？”部将李堪曰：“不如割地请和，两家且各罢兵，捱过冬天，到春暖别作计议。”韩遂曰：“李堪之言最善，可从之。”\n\n    超犹豫未决。杨秋、侯选皆劝求和，于是韩遂遣杨秋为使，直往操寨下书，言割地请和之事。操曰：“汝且回寨，吾来日使人回报。”杨秋辞去。贾诩入见操曰：“丞相主意若何？”操曰：“公所见若何？”诩曰：“兵不厌诈，可伪许之；然后用反间计，令韩、马相疑，则一鼓可破也。”操抚掌大喜曰：“天下高见，多有相合。文和之谋，正吾心中之事也。”于是遣人回书，言：“待我徐徐退兵，还汝河西之地。”一面教搭起浮桥，作退军之意。马超得书，谓韩遂曰：“曹操虽然许和，奸雄难测。倘不准备，反受其制。超与叔父轮流调兵，今日叔向操，超向徐晃；明日超向操，叔向徐晃：分头提备，以防其诈。”韩遂依计而行。\n\n    早有人报知曹操。操顾贾诩曰：“吾事济矣！”问：“来日是谁合向我这边？”人报曰：“韩遂。”次日，操引众将出营，左右围绕，操独显一骑于中央。韩遂部卒多有不识操者，出阵观看。操高叫曰：“汝诸军欲观曹公耶？�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
