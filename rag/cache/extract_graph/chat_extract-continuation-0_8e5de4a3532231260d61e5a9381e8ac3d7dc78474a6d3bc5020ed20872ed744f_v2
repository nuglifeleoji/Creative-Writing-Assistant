It seared the psyche and remolded her. One person entered and another emerged.\nDuncan! She opened her eyes and there was his face directly above her. Do I still love him? He is here. He is an anchor to which I clung in the worst moments. But do I love him? Am I still balanced?\nNo answer.\nOdrade spoke from somewhere out of view. “Strip those clothes off her. Towels. She’s drenched. And bring her a proper robe!”\nThere were scurrying sounds, then Odrade once more: “Murbella, you did that the hard way, I’m glad to say.”\nSuch elation in her voice. Why was she glad?\nWhere is the sense of responsibility? Where is the grail l'm supposed to feel in my head? Answer me, someone!\nBut the woman at the shuttle controls was gone.\nOnly | remain. And I remember atrocities that might make an Honored Matre quail. She glimpsed the grail then and it was not a thing but a question: How to set those balances aright?\nOur household god is this thing we carry forward generation after generation: our message for humankind if it matures. The closest thing we have to a household goddess is a failed Reverend Mother—Chenoeh there in her niche.\n—DARWI ODRADE\ndaho thought of his Mentat abilities as a retreat now.\nMurbella stayed with him as frequently as their duties allowed—he with his weapons development and she recovering strength while she adjusted to her new status.\nShe did not lie to him. She did not try to tell him she felt no difference between them. But he sensed the pulling away, elastic being stretched to its limits.\n“My Sisters have been taught not to divulge secrets of the heart. There’s the danger they perceive in love. Perilous intimacies. The deepest sensitivities blunted. Do not give someone a stick with which to beat you.”\nShe thought her words reassuring to him but he heard the inner argument. Be free! Break entangling bonds!\nHe saw her often these days in the throes of Other Memory. Words escaped her in the night.\n“Dependencies ... group soul... intersection of living awareness... Fish Speakers...”\nShe had no hesitation about sharing some of this. “The intersection? Anyone can sense nexus points in the natural interruptions of life. Deaths, diversions, incidental pauses between powerful events, births...”\n“Birth an interruption?”\nThey were in his bed, even the chrono darkened... but that did not hide them from comeyes, of course. Other energies fed the Sisterhood’s curiosity.\n“You never thought of birth as an interruption? A Reverend Mother finds that amusing.”\nAmusing! Pulling away... pulling away...\nFish Speakers, that was the revelation the Bene Gesserit absorbed with fascination. They had suspected, but Murbella gave them confirmation. Fish Speaker democracy became Honored Matre autocracy. No more doubts.\n“The tyranny of the minority cloaked in the mask of the majority,” Odrade called it, her voice exultant. “Downfall of democracy. Either overthrown by its own excesses or eaten away by bureaucracy.”\nIdaho could hear the Tyrant in that judgment. If history had any repetitive patterns, here was one. A drumbeat of repetition. First, a Civil Service law masked in the lie that it was the only way to correct demagogic excesses and spoils systems. Then the accumulation of power in places voters could not touch. And finally, aristocracy.\n“The Bene Gesserit may be the only ones ever to create the all-powerful jury,” Murbella said. “Juries are not popular with legalists. Juries oppose the law. They can ignore judges.”\nShe laughed in the darkness. “Evidence! What is evidence except those things you are allowed to perceive? That’s what Law tries to control: carefully managed reality.”\nWords to divert him, words to demonstrate her new Bene Gesserit powers. Her words of love fell flat.\nShe speaks them out of memory.\nHe saw this bothered Odrade almost as much as it dismayed him. Murbella did not notice either reaction.\nOdrade had tried to reassure him. “Every new Reverend Mother goes through an adjustment period. Manic at times. Think of the new ground under her, Duncan!”\nHow can I not think of it?\n“First law of bureaucracy,” Murbella told the darkness.\nYou do not divert me, love.\n“Grow to the limits of available energy!” Her voice was indeed manic. “Use the lie that taxes solve all problems.” She turned toward him in the bed but not for love. “Honored Matres played the whole routine! Even a social security system to quiet the masses, but everything went into their own energy bank.”\n“Murbella!”\n“What?” Surprised at the sharpness of his tone. Didn’t he know he was talking to a Reverend Mother?\n“I know all of this, Murbella. Any Mentat does.”\n“Are you trying to shut me up?” Angry.\n“Our job is to think like our enemy,” he said. “We do have a common enemy?”\n“You're sneering at me, Duncan.”\n“Are your eyes orange?”\n“Melange doesn’t allow that and you know .. . Oh.”\n“The Bene Gesserit need your knowledge but you must cultivate it!” He turned on a glowglobe and found her flaring at him. Not unexpected and not really Bene Gesserit.\nHybrid.\nThe word leaped into his mind. Was it hybrid vigor? Did the Sisterhood expect this of Murbella? The Bene Gesserit Surprised you sometimes. You found them facing you in odd corridors, eyes unwavering, faces masked in that way of theirs and, behind the masks, unusual responses brewing. That was where Teg learned to do the unexpected. But this? Idaho thought he could grow to dislike this new Murbella.\nShe saw this in him, naturally. He remained open to her as to no other person.\n“Don’t hate me, Duncan.” No pleading but something deeply hurt behind the words.\n“PIL never hate you.” But he turned off the light.\nShe nestled against him almost the way she had before the Agony. A/most. The difference tore at him.\n“Honored Matres see the Bene Gesserit as competitors for power,” Murbella said. “It’s not so much that men who\nfollow my former Sisters are fanatics, but they’re made incapable of self-determination by their addiction.”\n“Is that the way we are?”\n“Now, Duncan.”\n“You mean | could get this commodity at another store?”\nShe chose to assume he was talking about Honored Matre fears. “Many would abandon them if they could.” Turning toward him fiercely, she demanded a sexual response. Her abandon shocked him. As though this might be the last time she could experience such ecstasy.\nAfterward, he lay exhausted.\n“I hope I’m pregnant again,” she whispered. “We still need our babies.”\nWe need. The Bene Gesserit need. No longer “they need.”\nHe fell asleep to dream he was in the ship’s armory. It was a dream touched by realities. The ship remained a weapons factory as it actually had become. Odrade was talking to him in the dream armory. “I make decisions of necessity, Duncan. Little likelihood you’ll break out and run amok.”\n“lam too much the Mentat for that!” How self-important his dream voice! /’m dreaming and I know I dream. Why am lin the armory with Odrade?\nA list of weapons scrolled before his eyes.\nAtomics. (He saw big blasters and deadly dusts.)\nLasguns. (No counting the various models.)\nBacteriologicals.\nThe scroll was interrupted by Odrade’s voice. “We can assume smugglers concentrate as usual on small things that bring a big price.”\n“Soostones, of course.” Still self-important. /’m not that way!\n“Assassination weapons,” she said. “Plans and specifications for new devices.”\n“Theft of trade secrets is a big item with smugglers.” /’m insufferable!\n“There are always medicines and the diseases that require them,” she said.\nWhere is she? | can hear her but I can’t see her. “Do Honored Matres know our universe harbors blackguards not above sowing the problem before providing the solution?” Blackguards? | never use that word.\n“All things relative, Duncan. They burned Lampadas and butchered four million of our finest.”\nHe awoke and sat upright. Specifications for new devices! There it was in delicate detail, a way to miniaturize Holzmann generators. Two centimeters, no more. And much cheaper! How was that smuggled into my mind?\nHe slipped out of bed, not awakening Murbella, and groped his way to a robe. He heard her snuffle as he let himself out into the workroom.\nSeating himself at his console, he copied the design from his mind and studied it. Perfect! Englobement for sure. He transmitted to Archives with a flag for Odrade and Bellonda.\nWith a sigh, he sat back and examined his design once more. It vanished in a return to his dream scroll. Am / still dreaming? No! He could feel the chair, touch the console, hear the field buzzing. Dreams do that.\nThe scroll produced cutting and stabbing weapons, including some designed to introduce poisons or bacteria into enemy flesh.\nProjectiles.\nHe wondered how to stop the scroll and study details.\n“It’s all in your head!”\nHumans and other animals bred for attack scrolled past his eyes, hiding the console and its projection. Futars? How did Futars get in there? What do I know about Futars?\nDisruptors replaced the animals. Weapons to cloud mental activity or interfere with life itself. Disruptors? I’ve never heard that name before.\nDisruptors were succeeded by null-G “seekers” designed to hunt specific targets. Those I know.\nExplosives next, including ones to spread poisons and bacteriologicals.\nDeceptives, to project false targets. Teg had used those.\nEnergizers appeared next. He had a private arsenal of those: ways of increasing capacities of your troops.\nAbruptly, the shimmering net from his vision replaced scrolling weapons and he saw the elderly couple in their garden. They glared at him. The man’s voice became audible. “Stop spying on us!”\nIdaho gripped the arms of his chair and jerked himself forward but the vision disappeared before he could study details.\nSpying? He sensed a residue of the scroll in his mind, no longer visible but a musing voice... . masculine.\n“Defenses often must take on characteristics of the attack weapons. Sometimes, however, simple systems can divert the most devastating weapons.”\nSimple systems! He laughed aloud. “Miles! Where the hell are you, Teg? | have your disguised attack vessels! Inflated decoys! Empty except for a miniature Holzmann generator and lasgun.” He added this to his Archives transmissions.\nWhen he was finished, he asked himself once more about the visions. /nfluencing my dreams? What have I tapped?\nIn every spare minute since becoming Teg’s Weapons Master, he had been calling up Archival records. There had to be some clue in all of that massive accumulation!\nResonances and tachyon theory held his attention for a time. Tachyon theory figured in Holzmann’s original design. “Techys,” Holzmann had called his energy source.\nA wave system that ignored light speed’s limits. Light speed obviously did not limit foldspace ships. Techys?\n“It works because it works,” Idaho muttered. “Faith. Like any other religion.”\nMentats squirreled away much seemingly inconsequential data. He had a storehouse marked\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a Mentat and weapons developer, deeply involved with the Bene Gesserit and Murbella, struggling with their changing relationship and his role in the Sisterhood's plans.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a former Honored Matre who underwent the Agony to become a Reverend Mother, now adjusting to her new status and powers within the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Darwi Odrade is a Bene Gesserit leader who oversees Murbella's transformation and manages the Sisterhood's strategic decisions, including weapons development.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, focused on guiding humanity's evolution and combating threats like the Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and authoritarian faction opposed to the Bene Gesserit, known for their addictive control over followers and brutal tactics.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers were a democratic military force that evolved into the autocratic Honored Matres, as revealed by Murbella's Other Memory.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location in Tiruzia where Samuel Namara was held, mentioned in the context of hostage exchanges.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The Agony is the transformative ordeal undergone by candidates to become Reverend Mothers, reshaping their psyche and unlocking ancestral memories.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Murbella and Duncan Idaho share a complex romantic and strategic relationship, strained by her transformation into a Reverend Mother.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Murbella is a newly minted Reverend Mother, providing the Bene Gesserit with critical insights into the Honored Matres.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan Idaho collaborates with the Bene Gesserit as a Mentat and weapons developer, though he struggles with their manipulations.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a senior leader of the Bene Gesserit, directing their strategies and overseeing Murbella's integration.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit are mortal enemies, competing for power and control over humanity's future.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Fish Speakers' democratic structure degenerated into the Honored Matres' autocracy, as revealed by Murbella's memories.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>AGONY<|>Murbella underwent the Agony, transforming her into a Reverend Mother and altering her relationship with Duncan Idaho.<|>8\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
