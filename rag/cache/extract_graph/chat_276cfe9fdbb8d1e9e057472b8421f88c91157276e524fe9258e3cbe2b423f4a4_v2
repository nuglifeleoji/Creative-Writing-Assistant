The capture of my soul is the capture of a thousand souls.\n“Much more than that,” he countered.\n“Knowing the dangers, you persist.” She made it a statement, not a question.\n“Wabun 'k wabunat!” he said. Rising, thou risest!\nHe felt his choice as an obvious necessity. Doing this thing, it were best done actively. They must wind the past into the present and allow it to unreel into their future.\n“Muriyat,” she conceded, her voice low. /t must be done lovingly.\n“Of course.” He waved a hand to encompass total acceptance. “Then we will consult as our parents did.”\nGhanima remained silent, tried to swallow past a lump in her throat. Instinctively she glanced south toward the great open erg which was showing a dim grey pattern of dunes in the last of the day’s light. In that direction her father had gone on his last walk into the desert.\nLeto stared downward over the cliff edge at the green of the sietch oasis. All was dusk down there, but he knew its Shapes and colors: blossoms of copper, gold, red, yellow, rust, and russet spread right out to the rock markers which outlined the extent of the qanat-watered plantings. Beyond the rock markers stretched a stinking band of dead Arrakeen life, killed by foreign plants and too much water, now forming a barrier against the desert.\nPresently Ghanima said: “I am ready. Let us begin.”\n“Yes, damn all!” He reached out, touched her arm to soften the exclamation, said, “Please, Ghani... Sing that song. It makes this easier for me.”\nGhanima hitched herself closer to him, circled his waist with her left arm. She drew in two deep breaths, cleared her throat, and began singing in a clear piping voice the words her mother had so often sung for their father:\nHere | redeem the pledge thou gavest; | pour sweet water upon thee.\nLife shall prevail in this windless place: My love, thou shalt live in a palace, Thy enemies shall fall to emptiness. We travel this path together\nWhich love has traced for thee.\nSurely well do | show the way\nFor my love is thy palace...\nHer voice fell into the desert silence which even a whisper might despoil, and Leto felt himself sinking, sinking—\nbecoming the father whose memories spread like an overlayer in the genes of his immediate past.\nFor this brief space, | must be Paul, he told himself. This is not Ghani beside me; it is my beloved Chani, whose wise counsel has saved us both many a time.\nFor her part, Ghanima had slipped into the persona- memory of her mother with frightening ease, as she had known she would. How much easier this was for the female —and how much more dangerous.\nIn a voice turned suddenly husky, Ghanima said: “Look there, beloved!” First Moon had risen and, against its cold light, they saw an arc of orange fire falling upward into Space. The transport which had brought the Lady Jessica, laden now with spice, was returning to its mother-cluster in orbit.\nThe keenest of remembrances ran through Leto then, bringing memories like bright bell-sounds. For a flickering instant he was another Leto—Jessica’s Duke. Necessity pushed those memories aside, but not before he felt the piercing of the love and the pain.\nI must be Paul, he reminded himself.\nThe transformation came over him with a frightening duality, as though Leto were a dark screen against which his father was projected. He felt both his own flesh and his father’s, and the flickering differences threatened to overcome him.\n“Help me, father,” he whispered.\nThe flickering disturbance passed and now there was another imprint upon his awareness, while his own identity as Leto stood at one side as an observer.\n“My last vision has not yet come to pass,” he said, and the voice was Paul’s. He turned to Ghanima. “You know what | Saw.”\nShe touched his cheek with her right hand. “Did you walk into the desert to die, beloved? Is that what you did?”\n“It may be that | did, but that vision . . . Would that not be reason enough to stay alive?”\n“But blind?” she asked.\n“Even so.”\n“Where could you go?”\nHe took a deep, shuddering breath. “Jacurutu.”\n“Beloved!” Tears began flowing down her cheeks.\n“Muad’Dib, the hero, must be destroyed utterly,” he said. “Otherwise this child cannot bring us back from chaos.”\n“The Golden Path,” she said. “It is not a good vision.”\n“It’s the only possible vision.”\n“Alia has failed, then...”\n“Utterly. You see the record of it.”\n“Your mother has returned too late.” She nodded, and it was Chani’s wise expression on the childish face of Ghanima. “Could there not be another vision? Perhaps if—”\n“No, beloved. Not yet. This child cannot peer into the future yet and return safely.”\nAgain a shuddering breath disturbed his body, and Leto- observer felt the deep longing of his father to live once more in vital flesh, to make living decisions and... How desperate the need to unmake past mistakes!\n“Father!” Leto called, and it was as though he shouted echoingly within his own skull.\nIt was a profound act of will which Leto felt then: the slow, clinging withdrawal of his father’s internal presence, the release of senses and muscles.\n“Beloved,” Chani’s voice whispered beside him, and the withdrawal slowed. “What is happening?”\n“Don’t go yet,” Leto said, and it was his own voice, rasping and uncertain, still his own. Then: “Chani, you must tell us: How do we avoid... what has happened to Alia?”\nIt was Paul-within who answered him, though, with words which fell upon his inner ear, halting and with long pauses: “There is no certainty. You ... saw... what almost... happened... with... me.”\n“But Alia...”\n“The damned Baron has her!”\nLeto felt his throat burning with dryness. “Is he... have ese\n“He’s in you... but...1...wecannot... sometimes we sense... each other, but you...”\n“Can you not read my thoughts?” Leto asked. “Would you know thenif...he...”\n“Sometimes | can feel your thoughts... but!... we live only through...the... reflection of... your awareness. Your memory creates us. The danger... it is a precise\nmemory. And... those of us... those of us who loved power ...and gathered it at... any price... those can be... more precise.”\n“Stronger?” Leto whispered.\n“Stronger.”\n“I know your vision,” Leto said. “Rather than let him have me, l'Il become you.”\n“Not that!”\nLeto nodded to himself, sensing the enormous will-force his father had required to withdraw, recognizing the consequences of failure. Any possession reduced the possessed to Abomination. The recognition gave him a renewed sense of strength, and he felt his own body with abnormal acuteness and a deeply drawn awareness of past mistakes: his own and those of his ancestors. It was the uncertainties which weakened—he saw this now. For an instant, temptation warred with fear within him. This flesh possessed the ability to transform melange into a vision of the future. With the spice, he could breathe the future, shatter Time’s veils. He found the temptation difficult to shed, clasped his hands and sank into the prana-bindu awareness. His flesh negated the temptation. His flesh wore the deep knowledge learned in blood by Paul. Those who sought the future hoped to gain the winning gamble on tomorrow’s race. Instead they found themselves trapped\ninto a lifetime whose every heartbeat and anguished wail was known. Paul’s final vision had shown the precarious way out of that trap, and Leto knew now that he had no other choice but to follow that way.\n“The joy of living, its beauty is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you,” he said.\nA soft voice whispered in his ear: “I’ve always known that beauty.”\nLeto turned his head, stared into Ghanima’s eyes which glistened in the bright moonlight. He saw Chani looking back at him. “Mother,” he said, “you must withdraw.”\n“Ahhh, the temptation!” she said, and kissed him.\nHe pushed her away. “Would you take your daughter’s life?” he demanded.\n“It’s so easy ... SO foolishly easy,” she said.\nLeto, feeling panic begin to grip him, remembered what an effort of will his father’s persona-within had required to abandon the flesh. Was Ghanima lost in that observer-world where he had watched and listened, learning what he had required from his father?\n“I will despise you, mother,” he said.\n“Others won’t despise me,” she said. “Be my beloved.”\n“IfI do... you know what you both will become,” he said. “My father will despise you.”\n“Never!”\n“Twill”\nThe sound was jerked out of his throat without his volition and it carried all the old overtones of Voice which Paul had learned from his witch mother.\n“Don’t say it,” she moaned.\n“I will despise you!”\n“Please... please don’t say it.”\nLeto rubbed his throat, feeling the muscles become once more his own. “He will despise you. He will turn his back on you. He will go into the desert again.”\n“No...no...”\nShe shook her head from side to side.\n“You must leave, mother,” he said.\n“No...no...” But the voice lacked its original force.\nLeto watched his sister’s face. How the muscles twitched! Emotions fled across the flesh at the turmoil within her.\n“Leave,” he whispered. “Leave.”\n“NO-0-0-0...”\nHe gripped her arm, felt the tremors which pulsed through her muscles, the nerves twitching. She writhed, tried to pull away, but he held tightly to her arm, whispering: “Leave... leave...”\nAnd all the time, Leto berated himself for talking Ghani into this parent game which once they’d played often, but she had lately resisted. It was true that the female had more weakness in that inner assault, he realized. There lay the origin of the Bene Gesserit fear.\nHours passed and still Ghanima’s body trembled and twitched with the inner battle, but now his sister’s voice joined the argument. He heard her talking to that imago within, the pleading.\n“Mother... please—” And once: “You've seen Alia! Will you become another Alia?”\nAt last Ghanima leaned against him, whispered: “She has accepted it. She’s gone.”\nHe stroked her head. “Ghani, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. l'II never ask you to do that again. | was selfish. Forgive me.”\n“There’s nothing to forgive,” she said, and her voice came panting as though after great physical exertion. “We've learned much that we needed to know.”\n“She spoke to you of many things,” he said. “We’ll share it later when—”\n“No! We'll do it now. You were right.”\n“My Golden Path?”\n“Your damned Golden Path!”\n“Logic’s useless unless it’s armed with essential data,” he said. “But I—”\n“Grandmother came back to guide our education and to see if we’d\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_276cfe9fdbb8d1e9e057472b8421f88c91157276e524fe9258e3cbe2b423f4a4_v2"}
