He’d glimpsed something just then—like a vision, but not a vision. It had been a knife close to him. There!\n“Give me a moment to think,” Alia said.\n“My knife is patient,” Scytale said, “but Chani’s flesh is not. Take a reasonable amount of time.”\nPaul felt himself blinking. It could not be... but it was! He felt eyes! Their vantage point was odd and they moved in an erratic way. There! The knife swam into his view. With a breath-stilling shock, Paul recognized the viewpoint. It was that of one of his children! He was seeing Scytale’s knife hand from within the creche! It glittered only inches from him. Yes—and he could see himself across the room, as well —head down, standing quietly, a figure of no menace, ignored by the others in this room.\n“To begin, you might assign us all your CHOAM holdings,” Scytale suggested.\n“All of them?” Alia protested.\n“All.”\nWatching himself through the eyes in the creche, Paul Slipped his crysknife from its belt sheath. The movement produced a strange sensation of duality. He measured the distance, the angle. There’d be no second chance. He prepared his body then in the Bene Gesserit way, armed himself like a cocked spring for a single concentrated movement, a prajna thing requiring all his muscles balanced in one exquisite unity.\nThe crysknife leaped from his hand. The milky blur of it flashed into Scytale’s right eye, jerked the Face Dancer’s head back. Scytale threw both hands up and staggered backward against the wall. His knife clattered off the ceiling,\nto hit the floor. Scytale rebounded from the wall; he fell face forward, dead before he touched the floor.\nStill through the eyes in the creche, Paul watched the faces in the room turn toward his eyeless figure, read the combined shock. Then Alia rushed to the creche, bent over it and hid the view from him.\n“Oh, they're safe,” Alia said. “They’re safe.”\n“M’Lord,” Idaho whispered, “was that part of your vision?”\n“No.” He waved a hand in Idaho’s direction. “Let it be.”\n“Forgive me, Paul,” Alia said. “But when that creature said they could...revive...”\n“There are some prices an Atreides cannot pay,” Paul said. “You know that.”\n“I know,” she sighed. “But | was tempted...”\n“Who was not tempted?” Paul asked.\nHe turned away from them, groped his way to a wall, leaned against it and tried to understand what he had done. How? How? The eyes in the creche! He felt poised on the brink of terrifying revelation.\n“My eyes, father.”\nThe word-shapings shimmered before his sightless vision.\n“My son!” Paul whispered, too low for any to hear. “You're... aware.”\n“Yes, father. Look!”\nPaul sagged against the wall in a spasm of dizziness. He felt that he’d been upended and drained. His own life whipped past him. He saw his father. He was his father. And the grandfather, and the grandfathers before that. His awareness tumbled through a mind-shattering corridor of his whole male line.\n“How?” he asked silently.\nFaint word-shapings appeared, faded and were gone, as though the strain was too great. Paul wiped saliva from the corner of his mouth. He remembered the awakening of Alia in the Lady Jessica’s womb. But there had been no Water of Life, no overdose of melange this time. . . or had there?\nHad Chani’s hunger been for that? Or was this somehow the genetic product of his line, foreseen by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?\nPaul felt himself in the creche then, with Alia cooing over him. Her hands soothed him. Her face loomed, a giant thing directly over him. She turned him then and he saw his creche companion—a girl with that bony-ribbed look of strength which came from a desert heritage. She had a full head of tawny red hair. As he stared, she opened her eyes. Those eyes! Chani peered out of her eyes... and the Lady Jessica. A multitude peered out of those eyes.\n“Look at that,” Alia said. “They’re staring at each other.”\n“Babies can’t focus at this age,” Harah said.\n“I could,” Alia said.\nSlowly, Paul felt himself being disengaged from that endless awareness. He was back at his own wailing wall then, leaning against it. Idaho shook his shoulder gently.\n“M’Lord?”\n“Let my son be called Leto for my father,” Paul said, Straightening.\n“At the time of naming,” Harah said, “I will stand beside you as a friend of the mother and give that name.”\n“And my daughter,” Paul said. “Let her be called Ghanima.”\n“Usul!” Harah objected. “Ghanima’s an ill-omened name.’\n“It saved your life,” Paul said. “What matter that Alia made fun of you with that name? My daughter is Ghanima, a spoil of war.”\nPaul heard wheels squeak behind him then—the pallet with Chani’s body being moved. The chant of the Water Rite began.\n“Hal yawm!” Harah said. “I must leave now if | am to be the observer of the holy truth and stand beside my friend for the last time. Her water belongs to the tribe.”\n“Her water belongs to the tribe,” Paul murmured. He heard Harah leave. He groped outward and found Idaho’s\nr\nsleeve. “Take me to my quarters, Duncan.”\nInside his quarters, he shook himself free gently. It was a time to be alone. But before Idaho could leave there was a disturbance at the door.\n“Master!” It was Bijaz calling from the doorway.\n“Duncan,” Paul said, “let him come two paces forward. Kill him if he comes farther.”\n“Ayyah,” Idaho said.\n“Duncan is it?” Bijaz asked. “Is it tru/y Duncan Idaho?”\n“It is,” Idaho said. “I remember.”\n“Then Scytale’s plan succeeded!”\n“Scytale is dead,” Paul said.\n“But | am not and the plan is not,” Bijaz said. “By the tank in which | grew! It can be done! | shall have my pasts—all of them. It needs only the right trigger.”\n“Trigger?” Paul asked.\n“The compulsion to kill you,” Idaho said, rage thick in his voice. “Mentat computation: They found that | thought of you as the son I never had. Rather than slay you, the true Duncan Idaho would take over the ghola body. But... it might have failed. Tell me, dwarf, if your plan had failed, if I'd killed him, what then?”\n“Oh... then we'd have bargained with the sister to save her brother. But this way the bargaining is better.”\nPaul took a shuddering breath. He could hear the mourners moving down the last passage now toward the deep rooms and the water stills.\n“It’s not too late, m’Lord,” Bijaz said. “Will you have your love back? We can restore her to you. A ghola, yes. But now —we hold out the full restoration. Shall we summon servants with a cryological tank, preserve the flesh of your beloved...”\nIt was harder now, Paul found. He had exhausted his powers in the first Tleilaxu temptation. And now all that was for nothing! To feel Chani’s presence once more...\n“Silence him,” Paul told Idaho, speaking in Atreides battle tongue. He heard Idaho move toward the door.\n“Master!” Bijaz squeaked.\n“As you love me,” Paul said, still in battle tongue, “do me this favor: Kill him before | succumb!”\n“Noooooo .. .” Bijaz screamed.\nThe sound stopped abruptly with a frightened grunt.\n“I did him the kindness,” Idaho said.\nPaul bent his head, listening. He no longer could hear the mourners. He thought of the ancient Fremen rite being performed now deep in the sietch, far down in the room of the death-still where the tribe recovered its water.\n“There was no choice,” Paul said. “You understand that, Duncan?”\n“I understand.”\n“There are some things no one can bear. | meddled in all the possible futures | could create until, finally, they created me.”\n“M’Lord, you shouldn’t.. .”\n“There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers,” Paul said. “Nothing. Nothing can be done.”\nAs he spoke, Paul felt his link with the vision shatter. His mind cowered, overwhelmed by infinite possibilities. His lost vision became like the wind, blowing where it willed.\nWe say of Muad’Dib that he has gone on a journey into that land where we walk without footprints.\n—PREAMBLE TO THE QIZARATE CREED\nhere was a dike of water against the sand, an outer limit\nfor the plantings of the sietch holding. A rock bridge came next and then the open desert beneath Idaho’s feet. The promontory of Sietch Tabr dominated the night sky behind him. The light of both moons frosted its high rim. An orchard had been brought right down to the water.\nIdaho paused on the desert side and stared back at flowered branches over silent water—reflections and reality —four moons. The stillsuit felt greasy against his skin. Wet flint odors invaded his nostrils past the filters. There was a malignant simpering to the wind through the orchard. He listened for night sounds. Kangaroo mice inhabited the grass at the water verge; a hawk owl bounced its droning call into the cliff shadows; the wind-broken hiss of a sandfall came from the open bled.\nIdaho turned toward the sound.\nHe could see no movement out there on the moonlit dunes.\nIt was Tandis who had brought Paul this far. Then the man had returned to tell his account. And Paul had walked out into the desert—like a Fremen.\n“He was blind—truly blind,” Tandis had said, as though that explained it. “Before that, he had the vision which he told tous... but...”\nA shrug. Blind Fremen were abandoned in the desert. Muad’Dib might be Emperor, but he was also Fremen. Had he not made provision that Fremen guard and raise his children? He was Fremen.\nIt was a Skeleton desert here, Idaho saw. Moon-silvered ribs of rock showed through the sand; then the dunes began.\n| should not have left him alone, not even for a minute, Idaho thought. / knew what was in his mind.\n“He told me the future no longer needed his physical presence,” Tandis had reported. “When he left me, he called back. ‘Now I am free’ were his words.”\nDamn them! |daho thought.\nThe Fremen had refused to send ‘thopters or searchers of any kind. Rescue was against their ancient customs.\n“There will be a worm for Muad’Dib,” they said. And they began the chant for those committed to the desert, the ones whose water went to Shai-hulud: “Mother of sand, father of Time, beginning of Life, grant him passage.”\nIdaho seated himself on a flat rock and stared at the desert. The night out there was filled with camouflage\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, is the blind Emperor of the known universe, a Bene Gesserit-trained leader with prescient abilities who has just lost his beloved Chani and is grappling with the future of his children and his own destiny.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia Atreides is Paul's sister, a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who shares his prescient abilities and is deeply involved in the political and familial struggles of the Atreides line.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>Scytale is a Face Dancer and a Tleilaxu agent who attempts to manipulate Paul and Alia with the promise of reviving Chani, but is killed by Paul.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Chani is Paul's beloved and the mother of his children, who has recently died and whose body is being prepared for the Fremen Water Rite.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a loyal Atreides retainer, a ghola resurrected by the Tleilaxu, who serves Paul and ultimately kills Bijaz to protect him.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIJAZ<|>PERSON<|>Bijaz is a Tleilaxu dwarf and agent who attempts to manipulate Paul and Duncan Idaho with the promise of reviving Chani, but is killed by Duncan.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARAH<|>PERSON<|>Harah is a Fremen woman and friend of Chani, who participates in the naming ceremony for Paul and Chani's children and observes the Water Rite.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is Paul and Chani's newborn son, named after Paul's father, who exhibits early signs of prescient awareness.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is Paul and Chani's newborn daughter, named as a 'spoil of war,' who also shows signs of prescient awareness.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>The Lady Jessica is Paul's mother, a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, whose genetic legacy is evident in Paul and Alia's abilities.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER GAIUS HELEN MOHIAM<|>PERSON<|>A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who foresaw the potential of Paul's genetic line.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is the Fremen stronghold where Paul and his family reside, and where the events of the story unfold.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>A prison in Tiruzia where Samuel Namara was held, mentioned in a previous example but not directly relevant here.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER RITE<|>EVENT<|>The Fremen Water Rite is a funeral ceremony where the deceased's water is reclaimed for the tribe.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOLA<|>EVENT<|>A ghola is a clone resurrected by the Tleilaxu, such as Duncan Idaho, with the potential to regain past memories.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>ALIA<|>Paul and Alia are siblings who share prescient abilities and the burden of leadership<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CHANI<|>Paul deeply loved Chani, who was his beloved and the mother of his children<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Duncan Idaho is fiercely loyal to Paul, whom he regards as a son<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>LETO<|>Paul is the father of Leto, whom he names after his own father<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>GHANIMA<|>Paul is the father of Ghanima, whom he names as a 'spoil of war'<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SCYTALE<|>Paul kills Scytale to protect his children and resist Tleilaxu manipulation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>BIJAZ<|>Paul orders Duncan to kill Bijaz to prevent further temptation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>LETO<|>Alia coos over Leto and is present at his birth<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>GHANIMA<|>Alia coos over Ghanima and is present at her birth<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BIJAZ<|>Duncan kills Bijaz to protect Paul from further manipulation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GHANIMA<|>Leto and Ghanima are twins who share a prescient connection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>WATER RITE<|>Paul participates in the Water Rite for Chani, though he is not physically present<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANI<|>WATER RITE<|>Chani's body is the subject of the Water Rite, where her water is reclaimed by the tribe<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SIETCH TABR<|>Paul resides in Sietch Tabr, where he makes his final decisions<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
