   石神摇头。\n    “在大学能做的事，我一个人也能做。况且，我这把年级恐怕也没有大学肯要我了。”\n    “那倒不见得，不过，我不会勉强你。今后你也要加油。”\n    “你也是。”\n    “很高兴见到你。”\n    握手后，石神目送汤川远去，他并非依依不舍，而是不想让汤川看到他走进“天亭”。\n

“好，招牌一份，谢谢惠顾。”她回答后低声问道，“昨天府上有客人？”\n    “啊……对。”石神抬起脸，惊讶的眨眼。然后环顾四周低声说道：“最好别跟我说话，刑警或许在哪盯着。”\n    “对不起。”靖子脖子一缩。\n    在便当装好前，两人都默默无言，也刻意不让视线相对。\n    靖子瞥向马路，完全感觉不出有谁在跟监。当然，如果刑警真的在监视，肯定也不会让他察觉。\n    便当装好后，她把便当交给石神。\n    “是老同学。”他边付钱边嘟囔。\n    “什么？”\n    “是大学同学来找我，不好意思吵到你了。”石神极力不动嘴皮地说话。\n    “哪里，不会。”靖子不禁浮现笑容。为了不让外头的人看到她的表情，她垂着脸。\n    “原来是这样，我还想有客人找你，真是稀奇。”\n    “这是第一次，连我也吓了一跳。”\n    “你很高兴吧。”\n    “对，是啊。”石神拎起便当袋子，“那么，今晚见。”\n    大概是会再打电话的意思吧。好，靖子回答。\n    目送着石神浑圆的背影走向马路，她暗想：像他这样与世隔绝的人没想到竟然也会有友人来访。\n    过了早上的巅峰时间，她像往常一样去后面和小代子他们一起休息。小代子爱吃甜食，所以递给她麻^。爱吃咸食的米泽兴趣缺缺地喝着\n\n茶，打工的金子出去送便当了。\n
