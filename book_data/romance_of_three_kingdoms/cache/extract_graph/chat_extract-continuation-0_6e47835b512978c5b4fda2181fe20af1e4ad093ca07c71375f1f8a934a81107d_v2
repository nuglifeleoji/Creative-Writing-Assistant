�被关公拔剑砍之。卞喜下堂绕廊而走，关公弃剑执大刀来赶。卞喜暗取飞锤掷打关公。关公用刀隔开锤，赶将入去，一刀劈卞喜为两段。随即回身来看二嫂，早有军人围住，见关公来，四下奔走。关公赶散，谢普净曰：“若非吾师，已被此贼害矣。”普净曰：“贫僧此处难容，收拾衣钵，亦往他处云游也。后会有期，将军保重。”关公称谢，护送车仗，往荥阳进发。荥阳太守王植，却与韩福是两亲家；闻得关公杀了韩福，商议欲暗害关公，乃使人守住关口。待关公到时，王植出关，喜笑相迎。关公诉说寻兄之事。植曰：“将军于路驱驰，夫人车上劳困，且请入城，馆驿中暂歇一宵，来日登途未迟。”关公见王植意甚殷勤，遂请二嫂入城。馆驿中皆铺陈了当。王植请公赴宴，公辞不往；植使人送筵席至馆驿。关公因于路辛苦，请二嫂晚膳毕，就正房歇定；令从者各自安歇，饱喂马匹。关公亦解甲憩息。却说王植密唤从事胡班听令曰：“关某背丞相而逃，又于路杀太守并守关将校，死罪不轻！此人武勇难敌。汝今晚点一千军围住馆驿，一人一个火把，待三更时分，一齐放火；不问是谁，尽皆烧死！吾亦自引军接应。”胡班领命，便点起军士，密将干柴引火之物，搬于馆驿门首，约时举事。\n\n

胡班寻思：“我久闻关云长之名，不识如何模样，试往窥之。”乃至驿中，问驿吏曰：“关将军在何处？”答曰：“正厅上观书者是也。”胡班潜至厅前，见关公左手绰髯，于灯下凭几看书。班见了，失声叹曰：“真天人也！”公问何人，胡班入拜曰：“荥阳太守部下从事胡班。”关公曰：“莫非许都城外胡华之子否？”班曰：“然也。”公唤从者于行李中取书付班。班看毕，叹曰：“险些误杀忠良！”遂密告曰：“王植心怀不仁，欲害将军，暗令人四面围住馆驿，约于三更放火。今某当先去开了城门，将军急收拾出城。”\n\n
