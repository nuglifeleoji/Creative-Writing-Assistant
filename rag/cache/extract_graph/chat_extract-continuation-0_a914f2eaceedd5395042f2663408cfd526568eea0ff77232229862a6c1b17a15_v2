That is nowhere near as dangerous, however, as an informed and intelligent society with grievances. The damage that vengeful intelligence can wreak, you cannot even imagine. The Tyrant would seem a benevolent father figure by comparison with what you were about to create!”\nIt was all true, of course, but in a Bene Gesserit context, and it helped little with what he was commanded to do to the Duncan Idaho ghola—creating mental and physical agony in an almost helpless victim.\nEasiest to recall was the look in Duncan’s eyes. They did not change focus, but glared directly up into Teg’s face, even at the instant of the final screaming shout:\n“Damn you, Leto! What are you doing?”\nHe called me Leto.\nTeg limped backward two steps. His left leg tingled and ached where Duncan had struck it. Teg realized that he was panting and at the end of his reserves. He was much too old for such exertions and the things he had just done made him feel dirty. The reawakening procedure was thoroughly fixed in his awareness, though. He knew that gholas once had been awakened by conditioning them unconsciously to attempt murder on someone they loved. The ghola psyche, shattered and forced to reassemble, was always psychologically scarred. This new technique left the scars in the one who managed the process.\nSlowly, moving against the outcry of muscles and nerves that had been stunned by agony, Duncan slid backward off the table and stood leaning against his chair, trembling and glaring at Teg.\nTeg’s instructions said: “You must stand very quietly. Do not move. Let him look at you as he will.”\nTeg stood unmoving as he had been instructed. Memory of the Cerbol Revolt left his mind: He knew what he had done then and now. In a way, the two times were similar. He\nhad told the rebels no ultimate truths (if such existed); only enough to lure them back into the fold. Pain and its predictable consequences. “This is for your own good.”\nWas it really good, what they did to this Duncan Idaho ghola?\nTeg wondered what was occurring in Duncan’s consciousness. Teg had been told as much as was known about these moments, but he could see that the words were inadequate. Duncan’s eyes and face gave abundant evidence of internal turmoil—a hideous twisting of mouth and cheeks, the gaze darting this way and that.\nSlowly, exquisite in its slowness, Duncan’s face relaxed. His body continued to tremble. He felt the throbbing of his body as a distant thing, aches and darting pains that had happened to someone else. He was here, though, in this immediate moment—whatever and wherever this was. His memories would not mesh. He felt suddenly out of place in flesh too young, not fitted to his pre-ghola existence. The darting and twisting of awareness was all internal now.\nTeg’s instructors had said: “He will have ghola-imposed filters on his pre-ghola memories. Some of the original memories will come flooding back. Other recollections will return more slowly. There will be no meshing, though, until he recalls that original moment of death.” Bellonda had then given Teg the known details of that fatal moment.\n“Sardaukar,” Duncan whispered. He looked around him at the Harkonnen symbols that permeated the no-globe. “The Emperor’s crack troops wearing Harkonnen uniforms!” A wolfish grin twisted his mouth. “How they must have hated that!”\nTeg remained silently watchful.\n“They killed me,” Duncan said. It was a flatly unemotional statement, all the more chilling for its positive delivery. A violent shudder passed through him and the trembling subsided. “At least a dozen of them in that little room.” He looked directly at Teg. “One of them got through at me like a\nmeat cleaver right down on my head.” He hesitated, his throat working convulsively. His gaze remained on Teg. “Did | buy Paul enough time to escape?”\n“Answer all of his questions truthfully.”\n“He escaped.”\nNow, they came to a testing moment. Where had the Tleilaxu acquired the Idaho cells? The Sisterhood’s tests said they were original, but suspicions remained. The Tleilaxu had done something of their own to this ghola. His memories could be a valuable clue to that thing.\n“But the Harkonnens...” Duncan said. His memories from the Keep meshed. “Oh, yes. Oh, yes!” A fierce laugh shook him. He sent a roaring victory shout at the long-dead Baron Vladimir Harkonnen: “I paid you back, Baron! Oh, | did it to you for all of the ones you destroyed!”\n“You remember the Keep and the things we taught you?” Teg asked.\nA puzzled frown drew deep crease lines across Duncan’s forehead. Emotional pain warred with his physical pains. He nodded in response to Teg’s question. There were two lives, one that had been walled off behind the axlotl tanks and another... another... Duncan felt incomplete. Something remained suppressed within him. The reawakening was not finished. He stared angrily at Teg. Was there more? Teg had been brutal. Necessary brutality? Was this how you had to restore a ghola?\n“I...” Duncan shook his head from side to side like a great wounded animal in front of the hunter.\n“Do you have all of your memories?” Teg insisted.\n“All? Oh, yes. | remember Gammu when it was Giedi Prime—the oil-soaked, blood-soaked hell hole of the Imperium! Yes, indeed, Bashar. | was your dutiful student. Regimental commander!” Again, he laughed, throwing his head back in an oddly adult gesture for that young body.\nTeg experienced the sudden release of a deep satisfaction, far deeper than relief. It had worked as they\nsaid it would.\n“Do you hate me?” he asked.\n“Hate you? Didn’t | tell you | would be grateful?”\nAbruptly, Duncan lifted his hands and peered at them. He shifted his gaze downward at his youthful body. “What a temptation!” he muttered. He dropped his hands and focused on Teg’s face, tracing the lines of identity. “Atreides,” he said. “You're all so damned alike!”\n“Not all,” Teg said.\n“I’m not talking about appearance, Bashar.” His eyes went out of focus. “I asked my age.” There was a long silence, then: “Gods of the deep! So much time has passed!”\nTeg said what he had been instructed to say: “The Sisterhood has need of you.”\n“In this immature body? What am I supposed to do?”\n“Truly, | don’t know, Duncan. The body will mature and | presume a Reverend Mother will explain matters to you.”\n“Lucilla?”\nAbruptly, Duncan looked up at the ornate ceiling, then at the alcove and its baroque clock. He remembered coming here with Teg and Lucilla. This place was the same but it was different. “Harkonnens,” he whispered. He sent a glowering look at Teg. “Do you know how many of my family the Harkonnens tortured and killed?”\n“One of Taraza’s Archivists gave me a report.”\n“A report? You think words can tell it?”\n“No. But that was the only answer | had to your question.”\n“Damn you, Bashar! Why do you Atreides always have to be so truthful and honorable?”\n“I think it’s bred into us.”\n“That’s quite right.” The voice was Lucilla’s and came from behind Teg.\nTeg did not turn. How much had she heard? How long had she been there?\nLucilla came up to stand beside Teg but her attention was on Duncan. “I see that you’ve done it, Miles.”\n“Taraza’s orders to the letter,” Teg said.\n“You have been very clever, Miles,” she said. “Much more clever than | suspected you could be. That mother of yours should have been severely punished for what she taught you.”\n“Ahhhh, Lucilla the seductress,” Duncan said. He glanced at Teg and returned his attention to Lucilla. “Yes, now | can answer my other question—what she’s supposed to do.”\n“They’re called Imprinters,” Teg said.\n“Miles,” Lucilla said, “if you have complicated my task in ways that prevent me from carrying out my orders, | will have you roasted on a skewer.”\nThe emotionless quality of her voice sent a shudder through Teg. He knew her threat was a metaphor, but the implications in the threat were real.\n“A punishment banquet!” Duncan said. “How nice.”\nTeg addressed himself to Duncan: “There’s nothing romantic about what we’ve done to you, Duncan. I’ve assisted the Bene Gesserit in more than one assignment that left me feeling dirty, but never dirtier than this one.”\n“Silence!” Lucilla ordered. The full force of Voice was in the command.\nTeg let it flow through him and past him as his mother had taught, then: “Those of us who give our true loyalty to the Sisterhood have only one concern: survival of the Bene Gesserit. Not survival of any individual but of the Sisterhood itself. Deceptions, dishonesties—those are empty words when the question is the Sisterhood’s survival.”\n“Damn that mother of yours, Miles!” Lucilla paid him the compliment of not hiding her rage.\nDuncan stared at Lucilla. Who was she? Lucilla? He felt his memories stirring of themselves. Lucilla was not the same person ...not the same at all, and yet... bits and pieces were the same. Her voice. Her features. Abruptly, he saw\nagain the face of the woman he had glimpsed on the wall of his room at the Keep.\n“Duncan, my sweet Duncan.”\nTears fell from Duncan’s eyes. His own mother— another Harkonnen victim. Tortured ... who knew what else? Never seen again by her “sweet Duncan.”\n“Gods, | wish | had one of them to kill right now,” Duncan moaned.\nOnce more, he focused on Lucilla. Tears blurred her features and made the comparisons easier. Lucilla’s face blended with that of the Lady Jessica, beloved of Leto Atreides. Duncan glanced at Teg, back to Lucilla, shaking the tears from his eyes as he moved. The memory faces dissolved into that of the real Lucilla standing in front of him. Similarities ... but never the same. Never again the same.\nImprinter.\nHe could guess the meaning. A pure Duncan Idaho wildness arose in him. “Is it my child you want in your womb, Imprinter? | know you’re not called mothers for nothing.”\nHer voice cold, Lucilla said: “We’ll discuss it another time.”\n“Let us discuss it in a congenial place,” Duncan said, “Perhaps I'll sing you a song. Not as good as old Gurney Halleck would do it but good enough to prepare for a little bedsport.”\n“You find this amusing?” she asked.\n“Amusing? No, but | am reminded of Gurney. Tell me, Bashar, have you brought him back from the dead, too?”\n“Not to my knowledge,” Teg said.\n“Ahhhh, there was a singing man!” Duncan said. “He could be killing you while he sang and never miss a note.”\nHer manner still icy, Lucilla said: “We of the Bene Gesserit have learned to avoid music. It evokes too many confusing emotions. Memory-emotions, of course.”\nIt was meant to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with deep political and genetic influence, focused on survival and control through manipulation and breeding programs>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola, a clone resurrected from cells, with memories of his past life as a loyal retainer to House Atreides, now undergoing reawakening>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is a Bashar and a loyal servant of the Bene Gesserit, tasked with reawakening Duncan Idaho through brutal methods>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a Bene Gesserit Imprinter, skilled in Voice and seduction, assigned to manipulate Duncan Idaho for the Sisterhood's purposes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERBOL REVOLT<|>EVENT<|>The Cerbol Revolt was a past rebellion where Teg used psychological tactics to quell dissent, drawing parallels to his current task with Duncan>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Harkonnens are a ruthless noble house responsible for the torture and death of Duncan Idaho's family and others, deeply hated by Duncan>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARDARKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are the Emperor's elite troops, who killed Duncan Idaho in his past life while disguised as Harkonnens>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive faction known for genetic manipulation and ghola creation, including Duncan Idaho's resurrection>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIEDI PRIME<|>GEO<|>Giedi Prime, later renamed Gammu, was the Harkonnen homeworld, a brutal and oil-soaked planet in the Imperium>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEEP<|>GEO<|>The Keep is a location where Duncan Idaho was trained and held by the Bene Gesserit, part of his ghola conditioning>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MILES TEG<|>Miles Teg is responsible for Duncan Idaho's reawakening, involving mental and physical agony<|>8>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Bene Gesserit resurrected and manipulated Duncan Idaho for their survival goals<|>7>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LUCILA<|>Lucilla is assigned to imprint Duncan Idaho, creating a complex dynamic of seduction and control<|>6>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>HARKONNENS<|>Duncan Idaho harbors deep hatred for the Harkonnens due to their atrocities against his family<|>9>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SARDARKAR<|>The Sardaukar killed Duncan Idaho in his past life, a traumatic memory he recalls during reawakening<|>8>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Tleilaxu created Duncan Idaho's ghola, though the Bene Gesserit suspect hidden modifications<|>5>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Miles Teg is a loyal servant of the Bene Gesserit, carrying out their orders despite personal discomfort<|>7>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Lucilla is a Bene Gesserit Imprinter, executing the Sisterhood's breeding plans<|>8>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>CERBOL REVOLT<|>Miles Teg recalls the Cerbol Revolt as a parallel to his current task with Duncan Idaho<|>4>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>GIEDI PRIME<|>Duncan Idaho remembers Giedi Prime as the Harkonnen stronghold where he suffered<|>6>)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
