Anything was better than\nshattering these moments and producing the new consequences. There remained things for Otheym to say lest Time be diverted into even more horrifying channels.\n“I’ve now-sense,” Bijaz said.\nPaul noted that the dwarf had grown more nervous. Was the little man aware of things about to happen? Could Bijaz be his own oracle?\n“Did you inquire of Lichna?” Otheym asked suddenly, peering up at Dhuri with his one good eye.\n“Lichna is safe,” Dhuri said.\nPaul lowered his head, lest his expression betray the lie. Safe! Lichna was ashes in a secret grave.\n“That’s good then,” Otheym said, taking Paul’s lowered head for a nod of agreement. “One good thing among the evils, Usul. | don’t like the world we’re making, you know that? It was better when we were alone in the desert with only the Harkonnens for enemy.”\n“There’s but a thin line between many an enemy and many a friend,” Bijaz said. “Where that line stops, there’s no beginning and no end. Let’s end it, my friends.” He moved to Paul’s side, jittered from one foot to the other.\n“What’s now-sense?” Paul asked, dragging out these moments, goading the dwarf.\n“Now!” Bijaz said, trembling. “Now! Now!” He tugged at Paul’s robe. “Let us go now!”\n“His mouth rattles, but there’s no harm in him,” Otheym said, affection in his voice, the one good eye staring at Bijaz.\n“Even a rattle can signal departure,” Bijaz said. “And so can tears. Let’s be gone while there’s time to begin.”\n“Bijaz, what do you fear?” Paul asked.\n“| fear the spirit seeking me now,” Bijaz muttered. Perspiration stood out on his forehead. His cheeks twitched. “| fear the one who thinks not and will have no body except mine—and that one gone back into itself! | fear the things | see and the things | do not see.”\nThis dwarf does possess the power of prescience, Paul thought. Bijaz shared the terrifying oracle. Did he share the oracle’s fate, as well? How potent was the dwarf’s power? Did he have the little prescience of those who dabbled in the Dune Tarot? Or was it something greater? How much had he seen?\n“Best you go,” Dhuri said. “Bijaz is right.”\n“Every minute we linger,” Bijaz said, “prolongs... prolongs the present!”\nEvery minute I linger defers my guilt, Paul thought. A worm’s poisonous breath, its teeth dripping dust, had washed over him. It had happened long ago, but he inhaled the memory of it now—spice and bitterness. He could sense his own worm waiting—“the urn of the desert.”\n“These are troubled times,” he said, addressing himself to Otheym’s judgment of their world.\n“Fremen know what to do in time of trouble,” Dhuri said.\nOtheym contributed a shaky nod.\nPaul glanced at Dhuri. He’d not expected gratitude, would have been burdened by it more than he could bear, but Otheym’s bitterness and the passionate resentment he saw in Dhuri’s eyes shook his resolve. Was anything worth this price?\n“Delay serves no purpose,” Dhuri said.\n“Do what you must, Usul,” Otheym wheezed.\nPaul sighed. The words of the vision had been spoken. “There’ll be an accounting,” he said, to complete it. Turning, he strode from the room, heard Bijaz foot-slapping behind.\n“Bygones, bygones,” Bijaz muttered as they went. “Let bygones fall where they may. This has been a dirty day.”\nThe convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: “I feed on your energy.”\n—ADDENDA TO ORDERS IN COUNCIL THE EMPEROR PAUL MUAD’DIB\nF irst Moon stood high over the city as Paul, his shield activated and shimmering around him, emerged from the cul-de-sac. A wind off the massif whirled sand and dust down the narrow street, causing Bijaz to blink and shield his eyes.\n“We must hurry,” the dwarf muttered. “Hurry! Hurry!”\n“You sense danger?” Paul asked, probing.\n“I know danger!”\nAn abrupt sense of peril very near was followed almost immediately by a figure joining them out of a doorway.\nBijaz crouched and whimpered.\nIt was only Stilgar moving like a war machine, head thrust forward, feet striking the street solidly.\nSwiftly, Paul explained the value of the dwarf, handed Bijaz over to Stilgar. The pace of the vision moved here with great rapidity. Stilgar sped away with Bijaz. Security Guards enveloped Paul. Orders were given to send men down the street toward the house beyond Otheym’s. The men hurried to obey, shadows among shadows.\nMore sacrifices, Paul thought.\n“We want live prisoners,” one of the guard officers hissed.\nThe sound was a vision-echo in Paul’s ears. It went with solid precision here—vision/reality, tick for tick. Ornithopters\ndrifted down across the moon.\nThe night was full of Imperial troopers attacking.\nA soft hiss grew out of the other sounds, climbed to a roar while they still heard the sibilance. It picked up a terra-cotta glow that hid the stars, engulfed the moon.\nPaul, knowing that sound and glow from the earliest nightmare glimpses of his vision, felt an odd sense of fulfillment. It went the way it must.\n“Stone burner!” someone screamed.\n“Stone burner!” The cry was all around him. “Stone burner... stone burner...”\nBecause it was required of him, Paul threw a protective arm across his face, dove for the low lip of a curb. It already was too late, of course.\nWhere Otheym’s house had been there stood now a pillar of fire, a blinding jet roaring at the heavens. It gave off a dirty brilliance which threw into sharp relief every ballet movement of the fighting and fleeing men, the tipping retreat of ornithopters.\nFor every member of this frantic throng it was too late.\nThe ground grew hot beneath Paul. He heard the sound of running stop. Men threw themselves down all around him, every one of them aware that there was no point in running. The first damage had been done; and now they must wait out the extent of the stone burner’s potency. The things’s radiation, which no man could outrun, already had penetrated their flesh. The peculiar result of stone-burner radiation already was at work in them. What else this weapon might do now lay in the planning of the men who had used it, the men who had defied the Great Convention to use it.\n“God’s ... a stone burner,” someone whimpered. “I... don’t... want...to...be... blind.”\n“Who does?” The harsh voice of a trooper far down the street.\n“The Tleilaxu will sell many eyes here,” someone near Paul growled. “Now, shut up and wait!”\nThey waited.\nPaul remained silent, thinking what this weapon implied. Too much fuel in it and it’d cut its way into the planet’s core. Dune’s molten level lay deep, but the more dangerous for that. Such pressures released and out of control might split a planet, scattering lifeless bits and pieces through space.\n“I think it’s dying down a bit,” someone said.\n“It’s just digging deeper,” Paul cautioned. “Stay put, all of you. Stilgar will be sending help.”\n“Stilgar got away?”\n“Stilgar got away.”\n“The ground’s hot,” someone complained.\n“They dared use atomics!” a trooper near Paul protested.\n“The sound’s diminishing,” someone down the street said.\nPaul ignored the words, concentrated on his fingertips against the street. He could feel the rolling-rumbling of the thing—deep...deep...\n“My eyes!” someone cried. “I can’t see!”\nSomeone closer to it than I was, Paul thought. He still could see to the end of the cul-de-sac when he lifted his head, although there was a mistiness across the scene. A red-yellow glow filled the area where Otheym’s house and its neighbor had been. Pieces of adjoining buildings made dark patterns as they crumbled into the glowing pit.\nPaul climbed to his feet. He felt the stone burner die, silence beneath him. His body was wet with perspiration against the stillsuit’s slickness—too much for the suit to accommodate. The air he drew into his lungs carried the heat and sulfur stench of the burner.\nAs he looked at the troopers beginning to stand up around him, the mist on Paul’s eyes faded into darkness. He summoned up his oracular vision of these moments, then, turned and strode along the track that Time had carved for him, fitting himself into the vision so tightly that it could not\nescape. He felt himself grow aware of this place as a multitudinous possession, reality welded to prediction.\nMoans and groans of his troopers arose all around him as the men realized their blindness.\n“Hold fast!” Paul shouted. “Help is coming!” And, as the complaints persisted, he said: “This is Muad’Dib! | command you to hold fast! Help comes!”\nSilence.\nThen, true to his vision, a nearby guardsman said: “Is it truly the Emperor? Which of you can see? Tell me.”\n“None of us has eyes,” Paul said. “They have taken my eyes, as well, but not my vision. | can see you standing there, a dirty wall within touching distance on your left. Now wait bravely. Stilgar comes with our friends.”\nThe thwock-thwock of many ‘thopters grew louder all around. There was the sound of hurrying feet. Paul watched his friends come, matching their sounds to his oracular vision.\n“Stilgar!” Paul shouted, waving an arm. “Over here!”\n“Thanks to Shai-hulud,” Stilgar cried, running up to Paul. “You're not...” In the sudden silence, Paul’s vision showed him Stilgar staring with an expression of agony at the ruined eyes of his friend and Emperor. “Oh, m’Lord,” Stilgar groaned. “Usul... Usul... Usul...”\n“What of the stone burner?” one of the newcomers shouted.\n“It’s ended,” Paul said, raising his voice. He gestured. “Get up there now and rescue the ones who were closest to it. Put up barriers. Lively now!” He turned back to Stilgar.\n“Do you see, m’Lord?” Stilgar asked, wonder in his tone. “How can you see?”\nFor answer, Paul put a finger out to touch Stilgar’s cheek above the stillsuit mouthcap, felt tears. “You need give no moisture to me, old friend,” Paul said. “I am not dead.”\n“But your eyes!”\n“They've blinded my body, but not my vision,” Paul said. “Ah, Stil, | live in an apocalyptic dream.
