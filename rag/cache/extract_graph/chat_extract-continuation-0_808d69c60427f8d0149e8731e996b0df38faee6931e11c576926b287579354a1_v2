This is the concealment which an adept gives to those who are his.”\n“Irulan is not yours,” Scytale said. And he looked sideways at the Princess.\n“We all know why the conspiracy must be conducted only in my presence,” Edric said.\nUsing the voice mode for describing a machine, Irulan said: “You have your uses, apparently.”\nShe sees him now for what he is, Scytale thought. Good!\n“The future is a thing to be shaped,” Scytale said. “Hold that thought, Princess.”\nlrulan glanced at the Face Dancer.\n“People who share Paul’s aims and loyalties,” she said. “Certain of his Fremen legionaries, then, wear his cloak. | have seen him prophesy for them, heard their cries of adulation for their Mahdi, their Muad’Dib.”\nIt has occurred to her, Scytale thought, that she is on trial here, that a judgment remains to be made which could preserve her or destroy her. She sees the trap we set for her.\nMomentarily, Scytale’s gaze locked with that of the Reverend Mother and he experienced the odd realization that they had shared this thought about Irulan. The Bene Gesserit, of course, had briefed their Princess, primed her with the /ie adroit. But the moment always came when a Bene Gesserit must trust her own training and instincts.\n“Princess, | know what it is you most desire from the Emperor,” Edric said.\n“Who does not know it?” Irulan asked.\n“You wish to be the founding mother of the royal dynasty,” Edric said, as though he had not heard her. “Unless you join us, that will never happen. Take my oracular word on it. The Emperor married you for political reasons, but you'll never share his bed.”\n“So the oracle is also a voyeur,” Irulan sneered.\n“The Emperor is more firmly wedded to his Fremen concubine than he is to you!” Edric snapped.\n“And she gives him no heir,” Irulan said.\n“Reason is the first victim of strong emotion,” Scytale murmured. He sensed the outpouring of Irulan’s anger, saw\nhis admonition take effect.\n“She gives him no heir,” Irulan said, her voice measuring out controlled calmness, “because | am secretly administering a contraceptive. Is that the sort of admission you wanted from me?”\n“It'd not be a thing for the Emperor to discover,” Edric said, smiling.\n“I have lies ready for him,” Irulan said. “He may have truthsense, but some lies are easier to believe than the truth.”\n“You must make the choice, Princess,” Scytale said, “but understand what it is protects you.”\n“Paul is fair with me,” she said. “I sit in his Council.”\n“In the twelve years you've been his Princess Consort,” Edric asked, “has he shown you the slightest warmth?”\nlrulan shook her head.\n“He deposed your father with his infamous Fremen horde, married you to fix his claim to the throne, yet he has never crowned you Empress,” Edric said.\n“Edric tries to sway you with emotion, Princess,” Scytale said. “Is that not interesting?”\nShe glanced at the Face Dancer, saw the bold smile on his features, answered it with raised eyebrows. She was fully aware now, Scytale saw, that if she left this conference under Edric’s sway, part of their plot, these moments might be concealed from Paul’s oracular vision. If she withheld commitment, though...\n“Does it seem to you, Princess,” Scytale asked, “that Edric holds undue sway in our conspiracy?”\n“I’ve already agreed,” Edric said, “that l'Il defer to the best judgment offered in our councils.”\n“And who chooses the best judgment?” Scytale asked.\n“Do you wish the Princess to leave here without joining us?” Edric asked.\n“He wishes her commitment to be a real one,” the Reverend Mother growled. “There should be no trickery\nbetween us.”\nlrulan, Scytale saw, had relaxed into a thinking posture, hands concealed in the sleeves of her robe. She would be thinking now of the bait Edric had offered: to found a royal dynasty! She would be wondering what scheme the conspirators had provided to protect themselves from her. She would be weighing many things.\n“Scytale,” Irulan said presently, “it is said that you Tleilaxu have an odd system of honor: your victims must always have a means of escape.”\n“If they can but find it,” Scytale agreed.\n“Am I a victim?” Irulan asked.\nA burst of laughter escaped Scytale.\nThe Reverend Mother snorted.\n“Princess,” Edric said, his voice softly persuasive, “you already are one of us, have no fear of that. Do you not spy upon the Imperial Household for your Bene Gesserit Superiors?”\n“Paul Knows | report to my teachers,” she said.\n“But don’t you give them the material for strong propaganda against your Emperor?” Edric asked.\nNot “our” Emperor, Scytale noted. “Your” Emperor. Irulan is too much the Bene Gesserit to miss that slip.\n“The question is one of powers and how they may be used,” Scytale said, moving closer to the Guildsman’s tank. “We of the Tleilaxu believe that in all the universe there is only the insatiable appetite of matter, that energy is the only true solid. And energy learns. Hear me well, Princess: energy learns. This, we call power.”\n“You haven’t convinced me we can defeat the Emperor,” lrulan said.\n“We haven't even convinced ourselves,” Scytale said.\n“Everywhere we turn,” Irulan said, “his power confronts us. He’s the kwisatz haderach, the one who can be many places at once. He’s the Mahdi whose merest whim is absolute command to his Qizarate missionaries. He’s the\nmentat whose computational mind surpasses the greatest ancient computers. He is Muad’Dib whose orders to the Fremen legions depopulate planets. He possesses oracular vision which sees into the future. He has that gene pattern which we Bene Gesserits covet for—”\n“We know his attributes,” the Reverend Mother interrupted. “And we know the abomination, his sister Alia, possesses this gene pattern. But they’re also humans, both of them. Thus, they have weaknesses.”\n“And where are those human weaknesses?” the Face Dancer asked. “Shall we search for them in the religious arm of his Jinad? Can the Emperor’s Qizara be turned against him? What about the civil authority of the Great Houses? Can the Landsraad Congress do more than raise a verbal clamor?”\n“I suggest the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles,” Edric said turning in his tank. “CHOAM is business and business follows profits.”\n“Or perhaps the Emperor’s mother,” Scytale said. “The Lady Jessica, | understand, remains on Caladan, but is in frequent communication with her son.”\n“That traitorous bitch,” Mohiam said, voice level. “Would | might disown my own hands which trained her.”\n“Our conspiracy requires a lever,” Scytale said.\n“We are more than conspirators,” the Reverend Mother countered.\n“Ah, yes,” Scytale agreed. “We are energetic and we learn quickly. This makes us the one true hope, the certain salvation of humankind.” He spoke in the speech mode for absolute conviction, which was perhaps the ultimate sneer coming, as it did, from a Tleilaxu.\nOnly the Reverend Mother appeared to understand the subtlety. “Why?” she asked, directing the question at Scytale.\nBefore the Face Dancer could answer, Edric cleared his throat, said: “Let us not bandy philosophical nonsense.\nEvery question can be boiled down to the one: ‘Why is there anything?’ Every religious, business and governmental question has the single derivative: ‘Who will exercise the power?’ Alliances, combines, complexes, they all chase mirages unless they go for the power. All else is nonsense, as most thinking beings come to realize.”\nScytale shrugged, a gesture designed solely for the Reverend Mother. Edric had answered her question for him. The pontificating fool was their major weakness. To make sure the Reverend Mother understood, Scytale said: “Listening carefully to the teacher, one acquires an education.”\nThe Reverend Mother nodded slowly.\n“Princess,” Edric said, “make your choice. You have been chosen as an instrument of destiny, the very finest...”\n“Save your praise for those who can be swayed by it,” lrulan said. “Earlier, you mentioned a ghost, a revenant with which we may contaminate the Emperor. Explain this.”\n“The Atreides will defeat himself!” Edric crowed.\n“Stop talking riddles!” Irulan snapped. “What is this ghost?”\n“A very unusual ghost,” Edric said. “It has a body anda name. The body—that’s the flesh of a renowned swordmaster known as Duncan Idaho. The name...”\n“Idaho's dead,” Irulan said. “Paul has mourned the loss often in my presence. He saw Idaho killed by my father’s Sardaukar.”\n“Even in defeat,” Edric said, “your father’s Sardaukar did not abandon wisdom. Let us suppose a wise Sardaukar commander recognized the swordmaster in a corpse his men had slain. What then? There exist uses for such flesh\nand training ... if one acts swiftly.” “A Tleilaxu ghola,” Irulan whispered, looking sideways at Scytale.\nScytale, observing her attention, exercised his Face Dancer powers—shape flowing into shape, flesh moving and\nreadjusting. Presently, a slender man stood before her. The face remained somewhat round, but darker and with slightly flattened features. High cheekbones formed shelves for eyes with definite epicanthic folds. The hair was black and unruly.\n“A ghola of this appearance,” Edric said, pointing to Scytale.\n“Or merely another Face Dancer?” Irulan asked.\n“No Face Dancer,” Edric said. “A Face Dancer risks exposure under prolonged surveillance. No; let us assume that our wise Sardaukar commander had Idaho’s corpse preserved for the axolotl tanks. Why not? This corpse held the flesh and nerves of one of the finest swordsmen in history, an adviser to the Atreides, a military genius. What a waste to lose all that training and ability when it might be revived as an instructor for the Sardaukar.”\n“I heard not a whisper of this and | was one of my father’s confidantes,” Irulan said.\n“Ahh, but your father was a defeated man and within a few hours you had been sold to the new Emperor,” Edric said.\n“Was it done?” she demanded.\nWith a maddening air of complacency, Edric said: “Let us presume that our wise Sardaukar commander, knowing the need for speed, immediately sent the preserved flesh of Idaho to the Bene Tleilax. Let us suppose further that the commander and his men died before conveying this information to your father—who couldn’t have made much use of it anyway. There would remain then a physical fact, a bit of flesh which had been sent off to the Tleilaxu. There was only one way for it to be sent, of course, ona heighliner\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>Princess Consort of Emperor Paul, Bene Gesserit-trained, involved in a conspiracy against the Emperor, secretly administering a contraceptive to his concubine\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>A Tleilaxu Face Dancer, part of the conspiracy against Emperor Paul, skilled in shape-shifting and manipulation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDRIC<|>PERSON<|>A Guildsman conspirator, persuasive and strategic, seeks to sway Irulan to their cause\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>A Bene Gesserit leader, involved in the conspiracy, distrustful of Lady Jessica\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Emperor Muad'Dib, Kwisatz Haderach, mentat, and Fremen leader, target of the conspiracy\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Paul's sister, possesses the same gene pattern as Paul, considered an abomination by the Bene Gesserit\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Renowned swordmaster and adviser to the Atreides, presumed dead, potential ghola in the conspiracy\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood, involved in political and genetic manipulation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A faction known for genetic engineering, including gholas and Face Dancers\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COMBINE HONNETE OBER ADVANCER MERCANTILES (CHOAM)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major economic entity, potentially a lever against the Emperor\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LANDSRAAD CONGRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The assembly of Great Houses, a civil authority in the Imperium\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Desert warriors loyal to Paul, form his military backbone\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SARDAUKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elite soldiers of the former Emperor, involved in Duncan Idaho's capture\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Homeworld of the Atreides, where Lady Jessica resides\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>EVENT<|>A plot involving multiple factions to overthrow or weaken Emperor Paul\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IRULAN<|>PAUL<|>Irulan is Paul's Princess Consort but spies on him for the Bene Gesserit<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IRULAN<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Irulan reports to the Bene Gesserit as part of her training<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>TLEILAXU<|>Scytale is a Face Dancer and representative of the Tleilaxu<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>EDRIC<|>GUILD<|>Edric is a Guildsman, representing their interests in the conspiracy<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Reverend Mother is a high-ranking member of the Bene Gesserit<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>FREMEN<|>Paul commands the Fremen as their Mahdi and military leader<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>ALIA<|>Paul and Alia share the same gene pattern and are siblings<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SARDAUKAR<|>Duncan Idaho was killed by Sardaukar, who preserved his body<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>The Tleilaxu may have created a ghola of Duncan Idaho<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IRULAN<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>Irulan is a key participant in the conspiracy<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>Scytale is a central figure in the conspiracy<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>EDRIC<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>Edric is a strategist in the conspiracy<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>The Reverend Mother supports the conspiracy<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>Paul is the target of the conspiracy<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>CALADAN<|>Lady Jessica resides on Caladan<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOAM<|>CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAUL<|>CHOAM is considered a potential lever against Paul<|>6\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
