贤弟在许昌，与曹操青梅煮酒，共论英雄；贤弟尽举当世名士，操皆不许，而独曰天下英雄，惟使君与操耳，以曹操之权力，犹不敢居吾弟之先，何虑功业不建乎？”玄德乘着酒兴，失口答曰：“备若有基本，天下碌碌之辈，诚不足虑也。”表闻言默然。玄德自知语失，托醉而起，归馆舍安歇。后人有诗赞玄德曰：“曹公屈指从头数：天下英雄独使君。髀肉复生犹感叹，争教寰字不三分？”\n\n    却说刘表闻玄德语，口虽不言，心怀不足，别了玄德，退入内宅。蔡夫人曰：“适间我于屏后听得刘备之言，甚轻觑人，足见其有吞并荆州之意。今若不除，必为后患。”表不答，但摇头而已。蔡氏乃密召蔡瑁入，商议能事。瑁曰：“请先就馆舍杀之，然后告知主公。”蔡氏然其言。瑁出，便连夜点军。\n\n    却说玄德在馆舍中秉烛而坐，三更以后，方欲就寝。忽一人叩门而入，视之乃伊籍也：原来伊籍探知蔡瑁欲害玄德，特夤夜来报。当下伊籍将蔡瑁之谋，报知玄德，催促玄德速速起身。玄德曰：“未辞景升，如何便去？”籍曰：“公若辞，必遭蔡瑁之害矣。”玄德乃谢别伊籍，急唤从者，一齐上马，不待天明，星夜奔回新野。比及蔡瑁领军到馆舍时，玄德已去远矣。瑁悔恨无及，乃写诗一首于壁间，径入见表曰：“刘备有反叛之意，题反诗于壁上，不辞而去矣。”表不信，亲诣馆舍观之，果有诗四句。诗曰：“数年徒守困，空对旧山川。龙岂池中物，乘雷欲上天！”刘表见诗大怒，拔剑言曰：“誓杀此无义之徒！”行数步，猛省曰：“吾与玄德相处许多时，不曾见他作诗。此必外人离间之计也。”遂回步入馆舍，用剑尖削去此诗，弃剑上马。蔡瑁请曰：“军士已点齐，可就往新野擒刘备。”表曰：“未可造次，容徐图之。”蔡瑁见表持疑不决，乃暗与蔡夫人商议：即日大会众官于襄阳，就彼处谋之。次日，瑁禀表曰：“近年丰熟，合聚众官于襄阳，以示抚劝之意。请主公一行。”表曰：“吾近日气疾作，实不能行。可令二子为主待客。”瑁曰：“公子年幼，恐失于礼节。”表曰：“可往新野请玄德待客。”瑁暗喜正中其计，便差人请玄德赴襄阳。\n\n
