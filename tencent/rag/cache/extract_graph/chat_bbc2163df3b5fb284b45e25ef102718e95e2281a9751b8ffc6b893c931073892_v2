There was an inexorable quality to this realization—a movement like the movement of planets. It carried something of the order of the universe in it, inevitable and terrifying.\n“Sire,” Stilgar said, “perhaps we’d—”\n“Not now!” Paul snapped. “We've other problems at the moment.”\nAware that she dared not try to match logic with her brother, Alia put the past few moments aside, Bene Gesserit fashion, said: “Irulan sent you?” She found herself experiencing menace in that thought.\n“Indirectly,” Paul said. “The information she gives us confirms our suspicion that the Guild is about to try fora sSandworm.”\n“They'll try to capture a small one and attempt to start the spice cycle on some other world,” Stilgar said. “It means\nthey’ve found a world they consider suitable.”\n“It means they have Fremen accomplices!” Alia argued. “No offworlder could capture a worm!”\n“That goes without saying,” Stilgar said.\n“No, it doesn’t,” Alia said. She was outraged by such obtuseness. “Paul, certainly you...”\n“The rot is setting in,” Paul said. “We've known that for quite some time. I’ve never seen this other world, though, and that bothers me. If they—”\n“That bothers you?” Alia demanded. “It means only that they’ve clouded its location with Steersmen the way they hide their sanctuaries.”\nStilgar opened his mouth, closed it without speaking. He had the overwhelming sensation that his idols had admitted blasohemous weakness.\nPaul, sensing Stilgar’s disquiet, said: “We've an immediate problem! | want your opinion, Alia. Stilgar suggests we expand our patrols in the open bled and reinforce the sietch watch. It’s just possible we could spot a landing party and prevent the—”\n“With a Steersman guiding them?” Alia asked.\n“They are desperate, aren’t they?” Paul agreed. “That is why I’m here.”\n“What’ve they seen that we haven't?” Alia asked.\n“Precisely.”\nAlia nodded, remembering her thoughts about the new Dune Tarot. Quickly, she recounted her fears.\n“Throwing a blanket over us,” Paul said.\n“With adequate patrols,” Stilgar ventured, “we might prevent the—”\n“We prevent nothing . . . forever,” Alia said. She didn’t like the fee/ of the way Stilgar’s mind was working now. He had narrowed his scope, eliminated obvious essentials. This was not the Stilgar she remembered.\n“We must count on their getting a worm,” Paul said. “Whether they can start the melange cycle on another\nplanet is a different question. They’ll need more than a worm.”\nStilgar looked from brother to sister. Out of ecological thinking that had been ground into him by sietch life, he grasped their meaning. A captive worm couldn’t live except within a bit of Arrakis—sand plankton, Little Makers and all. The Guild’s problem was large, but not impossible. His own growing uncertainty lay in a different area.\n“Then your visions do not detect the Guild at its work?” he asked.\n“Damnation!” Paul exploded.\nAlia studied Stilgar, sensing the savage sideshow of ideas taking place in his mind. He was hung on a rack of enchantment. Magic! Magic! To glimpse the future was to steal terrifying fire from a sacred flame. It held the attraction of ultimate peril, souls ventured and lost. One brought back from the formless, dangerous distances something with form and power. But Stilgar was beginning to sense other forces, perhaps greater powers beyond that unknown horizon. His Queen Witch and Sorcerer Friend betrayed dangerous weaknesses.\n“Stilgar,” Alia said, fighting to hold him, “you stand ina valley between dunes. | stand on the crest. | see where you do not see. And, among other things, | see mountains which conceal the distances.”\n“There are things hidden from you,” Stilgar said. “This you've always said.”\n“All power is limited,” Alia said.\n“And danger may come from behind the mountains,” Stilgar said.\n“It’s something on that order,” Alia said.\nStilgar nodded, his gaze fastened on Paul’s face. “But whatever comes from behind the mountains must cross the dunes.”\nThe most dangerous game in the universe is to govern from an oracular base. We do not consider ourselves wise enough or brave enough to play that game. The measures detailed here for regulation in lesser matters are as near as we dare venture to the brink of government. For our purposes, we borrow a definition from the Bene Gesserit and we consider the various worlds as gene pools, sources of teachings and teachers, sources of the possible. Our goal is not to rule, but to tap these gene pools, to learn, and to free ourselves from all restraints imposed by dependency and government.\n—“THE ORGY AS A TOOL OF STATECRAFT,” CHAPTER THREE OF THE STEERSMAN’S GUILD\nll | s that where your father died?” Edric asked, sending a beam pointer from his tank to a jeweled marker on one of the relief maps adorning a wall of Paul’s reception salon.\n“That’s the shrine of his skull,” Paul said. “My father died a prisoner on a Harkonnen frigate in the sink below us.”\n“Oh, yes: | recall the story now,” Edric said. “Something about killing the old Baron Harkonnen, his mortal enemy.” Hoping he didn’t betray too much of the terror which small enclosures such as this room imposed upon him, Edric rolled over in the orange gas, directed his gaze at Paul, who sat alone on a long divan of striped gray and black.\n“My sister killed the Baron,” Paul said, voice and manner dry, “just before the battle of Arrakeen.”\nAnd why, he wondered, did the Guild man-fish reopen old wounds in this place and at this time?\nThe Steersman appeared to be fighting a losing battle to contain his nervous energies. Gone were the languid fish motions of their earlier encounter. Edric’s tiny eyes jerked here... there, questing and measuring. The one attendant who had accompanied him in here stood apart near the line of houseguards ranging the end wall at Paul’s left. The attendant worried Paul—hulking, thick-necked, blunt and\nvacant face. The man had entered the salon, nudging Edric’s tank along on its supporting field, walking with a stranger’s gait, arms akimbo.\nScytale, Edric had called him. Scytale, an aide.\nThe aide’s surface shouted stupidity, but the eyes betrayed him. They laughed at everything they saw.\n“Your concubine appeared to enjoy the performance of the Face Dancers,” Edric said. “It pleases me that | could provide that small entertainment. | particularly enjoyed her reaction to seeing her own features simultaneously repeated by the whole troupe.”\n“Isn't there a warning against Guildsmen bearing gifts?” Paul asked.\nAnd he thought of the performance out there in the Great Hall. The dancers had entered in the costumes and guise of the Dune Tarot, flinging themselves about in seemingly random patterns that devolved into fire eddies and ancient prognostic designs. Then had come the rulers—a parade of kings and emperors like faces on coins, formal and stiff in outline, but curiously fluid. And the jokes: a copy of Paul’s own face and body, Chani repeated across the floor of the Hall, even Stilgar, who had grunted and shuddered while others laughed.\n“But our gifts have the kindest intent,” Edric protested.\n“How kindly can you be?” Paul asked. “The ghola you gave us believes he was designed to destroy us.”\n“Destroy you, Sire?” Edric asked, all bland attention. “Can one destroy a god?”\nStilgar, entering on the last words, stopped, glared at the guards. They were much farther from Paul than he liked. Angrily he motioned them closer.\n“It’s all right, Stil,” Paul said, lifting a hand. “Just a friendly discussion. Why don’t you move the Ambassador’s tank over by the end of my divan?”\nStilgar, weighing the order, saw that it would put the Steersman’s tank between Paul and the hulking aide, much\ntoo close to Paul, but...\n“It’s all right, Stil,” Paul repeated, and he gave the private hand-signal which made the order an imperative.\nMoving with obvious reluctance, Stilgar pushed the tank closer to Paul. He didn’t like the feel of the container or the heavily perfumed smell of melange around it. He took up a position at the corner of the tank beneath the orbiting device through which the Steersman spoke.\n“To kill a god,” Paul said. “That’s very interesting. But who says I’m a god?”\n“Those who worship you,” Edric said, glancing pointedly at Stilgar.\n“Is this what you believe?” Paul asked.\n“What | believe is of no moment, Sire,” Edric said. “It seems to most observers, however, that you conspire to make a god of yourself. And one might ask if that is something any mortal can do... safely?”\nPaul studied the Guildsman. Repellent creature, but perceptive. It was a question Paul had asked himself time and again. But he had seen enough alternate Timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself. Much worse. These were not, however, the normal avenues for a Steersman to probe. Curious. Why had that question been asked? What could Edric hope to gain by such effrontery? Paul’s thoughts went flick (the association of Tleilaxu would be behind this move)—flick (the Jihad’s recent Sembou victory would bear on Edric’s action)—flick (various Bene Gesserit credos showed themselves here)— flick...\nA process involving thousands of information bits poured flickering through his computational awareness. It required perhaps three seconds.\n“Does a Steersman question the guidelines of prescience?” Paul asked, putting Edric on the weakest ground.\nThis disturbed the Steersman, but he covered well, coming up with what sounded like a long aphorism: “No man of intelligence questions the fact of prescience, Sire. Oracular vision has been known to men since most ancient times. It has a way of entangling us when we least suspect. Luckily, there are other forces in our universe.”\n“Greater than prescience?” Paul asked, pressing him.\n“If prescience alone existed and did everything, Sire, it would annihilate itself. Nothing but prescience? Where could it be applied except to its own degenerating movements?”\n“There’s always the human situation,” Paul agreed.\n“A precarious thing at best,” Edric said, “without confusing it by hallucinations.”\n“Are my visions no more than hallucinations?” Paul asked, mock sadness in his voice. “Or do you imply that my worshippers hallucinate?”\nStilgar, sensing the mounting tensions, moved a step nearer Paul, fixed his attention on the Guildsman reclining in the tank.\n“You twist my words, Sire,” Edric protested. An odd sense of violence lay suspended in the words.\nViolence here? Paul wondered. They wouldn’t dare! Unless (and he glanced at his guards) the forces which protected him were to be used in replacing him.\n“But you accuse me of conspiring to make a god of myself,” Paul said, pitching his voice that only Edric and Stilgar might hear. “Conspire?”\n“A poor choice of words\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bbc2163df3b5fb284b45e25ef102718e95e2281a9751b8ffc6b893c931073892_v2"}
