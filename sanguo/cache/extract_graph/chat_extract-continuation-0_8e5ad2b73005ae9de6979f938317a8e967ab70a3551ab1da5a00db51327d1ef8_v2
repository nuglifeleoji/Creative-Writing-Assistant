   却说曹仁与李典回许都，见曹操，泣拜于地请罪，具言损将折兵之事。操曰：“胜负乃军家之常。但不知谁为刘备画策？”曹仁言是单福之计。操曰：“单福何人也？”程昱笑曰：“此非单福也。此人幼好学击剑；中平末年，尝为人报仇杀人，披发涂面而走，为吏所获；问其姓名不答，吏乃缚于车上，击鼓行于市，今市人识之，虽有识者不敢言，而同伴窃解救之。乃更姓名而逃，折节向学，遍访名师，尝与司马徽谈论。此人乃颍川徐庶，字元直。单福乃其托名耳。”操曰：“徐庶之才，比君何如？”昱曰：“十倍于昱。”操曰：“惜乎贤士归于刘备！羽翼成矣？奈何？”昱曰：“徐庶虽在彼，丞相要用，召来不难。”操曰：“安得彼来归？”昱曰：“徐庶为人至孝。幼丧其父，止有老母在堂。现今其弟徐康已亡，老母无人侍养。丞相可使人赚其母至许昌，令作书召其子，则徐庶必至矣。”\n\n
