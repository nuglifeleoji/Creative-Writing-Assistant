It is known for its involvement in a large weapon research project and is a key location for the investigation of extraterrestrial signals. The base has been associated with the 红岸工程, a national defense initiative focused on radio astronomy and advanced technological research.\n\nThe facility holds personal significance for the character 叶文洁, who has a deep connection to the base due to her past experiences, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. It is here that she sought understanding and closure regarding her father's death. 红岸基地 serves as a backdrop for her work in communication with extraterrestrial life, where she was involved in monitoring and sending signals into the universe, aiming to establish contact with alien civilizations.\n\nIn recent developments, the security level of 红岸基地 has been lowered, allowing local residents to approach the area, which marks a shift in its previously isolated status. Despite its recent accessibility, the base remains a secretive institution, engaged in significant scientific research and technology development related to extraterrestrial exploration.\n\nThe narrative surrounding 红岸基地 intertwines with the lives of its personnel, including 叶文洁 and her colleague 杨卫宁, who both worked at this secluded facility. The base is not only a site of military operations but also a crucial element in the characters' personal stories, reflecting their struggles and aspirations in the context of broader historical events.\n\nOverall, 红岸基地 is a complex entity that embodies the intersection of military ambition, scientific inquiry, and personal history, making it a significant location in the narrative. Its dual role as a military base and a research facility dedicated to the exploration of extraterrestrial life underscores its importance in both national defense and the quest for knowledge beyond Earth.\",27\r\n58,叶文洁,\"Ye Wenjie is a complex and pivotal character in the narrative, deeply intertwined with themes of loss, trauma, and the quest for understanding both human and extraterrestrial civilizations. As the supreme leader of the Earth Trisolaris Rebellion, she serves as a spiritual guide, though her direct involvement in the organization's operations is limited. Ye's character is marked by her significant interactions with alien civilizations, stemming from her work at the Red Coast Base (红岸基地), where she contributed to the development of radio astronomy and engaged in research on solar electromagnetic radiation.\n\nBorn in June 1947, Ye Wenjie is a retired professor specializing in astrophysics, with a background in electronic engineering and computer science. Her academic journey was profoundly affected by the Cultural Revolution, during which she faced immense personal hardships, including the traumatic loss of her father, who was a victim of political violence. This legacy of loss shapes her worldview and her reflections on humanity's irrationality and the moral implications of scientific progress.\n\nThroughout her life, Ye has grappled with her past, including her father's death and her own experiences during the Cultural Revolution. She is depicted as a sensitive and introspective individual, often reflecting on her childhood and the societal changes around her. Her character embodies a connection to historical events, particularly the experiences of the Red Guards, and she is portrayed as someone who seeks closure regarding her father's legacy.\n\nYe Wenjie is also involved in significant scientific endeavors, including the observation of cosmic background radiation and the decoding of unusual signals from space. Her work at the Red Coast Base includes operating monitoring systems and engaging in discussions about extraterrestrial communication, which further complicates her character as she navigates the moral and ethical dilemmas associated with such knowledge.\n\nIn addition to her scientific pursuits, Ye is depicted as a mother to Yang Dong, and her relationship with her daughter adds another layer of emotional depth to her character. She is portrayed as a gentle intellectual, reflecting on environmental issues and the impact of deforestation, which resonates with her sensitivity to the suffering of nature.\n\nYe Wenjie is also a figure of redemption, facing trial for her past actions and presented with opportunities to contribute positively to society through defense research projects. Her journey is marked by a transformation from a secluded existence to rejoining society, where she continues to reflect on her past and the implications of her choices.\n\nOverall, Ye Wenjie is a multifaceted character who embodies the struggles of a scientist caught between personal trauma, historical legacy, and the pursuit of knowledge in a world fraught with moral complexities. Her role in the Earth Trisolaris Rebellion and her interactions with extraterrestrial intelligence position her as a key figure in the narrative, representing both the potential and the peril of humanity's quest for understanding beyond its own boundaries.\",158\r\n476,监听部,\"监听部 is a specialized department known for its advanced technology dedicated to receiving and analyzing signals.
