时钟指着上午七点三十分。石神抱着公事包走出家门，公事包里，放着他在这个世上最在乎的东西。是他目前正在研究的某个数学理论的相关档案。与其说目前，说是多年来持续研究至今，或许更为正确。毕竟，连大学的毕业论文，他都是以那个理论为研究主题，而且至今尚未完成。\n    要完成这个数学理论，恐怕还得再耗费二十年以上的光阴，他暗自估算着。弄得不好，说不定还得更久。正因为如此艰难，他坚信这才是最适合数学家投注一升的课题。而且，他也自负除了自己之外无人能够完成。\n    如果能够完成不须考虑其他，也不用被杂务剥夺时间，可以专心研究的话不知该有多好――石神常常驰骋在这样的妄想中。每次只要想到有生之年不知是否能完成这个研究，他就惴惴不安地觉得把时间耗在其他不相干的事情实在可惜。\n    他决心不管去哪里，都不能抛下这个档案夹。他得珍惜分分秒秒，就算让研究再进一步也好。只要有纸笔，这并非不可能。只要能继续这个研究，他便别无所求。\n    他机械性的走着固定的路线。过了新大桥，沿着隅田川边前行，右边是蓝色塑胶布搭成的成排小屋。一头花白长发绑在脑后的男人,正把锅子放在瓦斯炉上，不知锅里是什么。男人身边系着浅咖啡色的杂种狗，狗把屁股对着主人，懒洋洋地坐着。\n    “罐男”还是老样子，忙着压扁罐子，一个人嘀嘀咕咕地自言自语。他身边，放了两个早已塞满空罐的塑胶袋。\n    经过“罐男”面前继续走了一阵子，就看到长椅，椅子上空无一人。石神朝那里瞥了一眼，又恢复低头的姿势。他的步调毫无变化。\n    前方似乎有人走过来。就时间来说，应该是遇到那个牵三只狗的老妇人的时候，不过好像不是她。石神不经意地抬起脸。\n    “啊！”他不禁脱口喊出，停下脚步。\n    对方没停足。不仅如此，还一脸微笑地朝他走近。对方来到石神面前，终于停下脚步。\n    “早。”汤川学说。\n    石神霎时张口结舌，舔舔嘴唇才开口。\n    “你在等我吗？”\n    “那当然。”汤川依旧表情愉悦的回答，“不过说等你好像有点不正确。我从清洲桥那边一路闲晃过来，心想或许能遇见你。”\n    “你好像有什么重要的急事。”\n    “急事……不知道。或许算是吧。”汤川歪着头。\n    “急着现在谈吗？”石神看看手表，“我没什么时间。”\n    “十分或十五分钟就行了。”\n    “边走边谈好吗？”\n    “那倒是无所谓。”汤川环视四周，“不过我想在这儿先\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHIGEN<|>PERSON<|>Shigen is a
