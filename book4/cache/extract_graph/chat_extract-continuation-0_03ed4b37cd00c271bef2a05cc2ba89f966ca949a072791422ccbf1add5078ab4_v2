好心的妇女，他真想到什么地方去哭一鼻子。对他来说，换个轻活干当然很好，但更重要的是，他在这样更换的环境中，竟然也感觉到了人心的温暖。无庸置疑，处在他眼下的地位，这种被别人关怀所引起的美好情感。简直无法用言语来表述…… \n　　半月以后，孙少平已经开始渐渐适应了他的新生活。脊背上溃烂的皮肉结成了干痂，变成了一种深度的疼痈；而不象开始时那般尖锐。手上的肉皮磨薄后又开始厚起来，和石头接触也没有了那种刀割般的疼痛感。身架被强度的劳累弄得松松垮垮——这样就可以较为舒展地承受一般的压力……黄土高原第一场连绵的春雨来临了。雨天不能出工，做活的工匠们就抓紧时候，开始白天黑夜倒在没门窗的敞口子窑里睡觉；沉重的鼾声如雷一般此起彼伏。雨天不出工，当然没有工钱，但主家按行规给工匠继续管饭。 \n　　下雨的第二天，少平睡足觉后，很想去街上走一走。他计算过，他已经赚下二十多块钱，他想从主家那里预支十块，加上他原来带的十几块钱，到街上为自己买一身外衣……他的衣服烂得快不能见人了。 \n　　他从女主人那里拿了钱以后，又从一个工匠那里借了一顶破草帽。就一个人冒着朦朦春雨来到街上。 \n　　雨中的大街行人稀稀疏疏，小汽车溅着水急驶而过；远处，涨水的黄原河发出深沉的呜咽。 \n　　少平从阳沟泥泞的路上走出来后，先忍不住趴在黄原宾馆的大铁门上。向里面张望了一会——那里面是他所不了解的另一种生活…… \n　　离开这座富丽的建筑物，不知为什么，他猛一下想起了田晓霞。 \n　　是的，他们又在同一城市里了——不远处就是著名的黄原师专。但他决不会再去找她。人家已经成了大学生，他现在是个揽工小子，怎么能去找她呢！随着社会地位差距越来越大，过去的那一切似乎迅速地变得遥远了。 \n　　他想，要是眼下碰见晓霞，双方一定会有一种陌生感……朋友，看来我们是永远地分别了！ \n　　少平走到市内最大的一个百货商店，为自己细心地挑选了一身深蓝的卡衣服。他怀着喜悦的心情，把这身玻璃纸包着的服装夹在胳膊窝里，然后又顺着街道闲逛了一会，就返身向阳沟那里走去；买衣服后，他身上就没几个钱了，在街上瞎逛荡还不如回去再睡一觉！ \n　　当他从街上回到那个敞口子窑后，满窑的工匠仍然睡得象死人一般。 \n　　他从被子旁把黄提包打开，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character adapting to a new life and experiencing warmth
