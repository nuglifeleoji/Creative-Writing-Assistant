Did Mirlat or any of the others fear that Atreides words could subvert the Shariat?\nWaff posed this question, too, and saw the worried frowns.\n“Is there one among you,” Waff asked, “who believes that a single powindah knows how we use the language of God?”\nThere! Let them think on that! Every one of them here had been wakened time after time in ghola flesh. There was a fleshly continuity in this Council that no other people had ever achieved. Mirlat himself had seen the Prophet with his own eyes. Scytale had spoken to Muad’Dib! Learning how the flesh could be renewed and the memories restored, they had condensed this power into a single government whose potency was confined lest it be demanded everywhere. Only the witches had a similar storehouse of experience upon which to draw and they moved with fearful caution, terrified that they might produce another Kwisatz Haderach!\nWaff said these things to his councillors, adding: “The time for action has come.”\nWhen no one spoke disagreement, Waff said: “This manifesto has a single author. Every analysis agrees. Mirlat?”\n“Written by one person and that person a true Atreides, no doubt of it,” Mirlat agreed.\n“All at the powindah conference affirmed this,” Waff said. “Even a third-stage Guild steersman agrees.”\n“But that one person has produced a thing that excites violent reactions among diverse peoples,” Mirlat argued.\n“Have we ever questioned the Atreides talent for disruption?” Waff asked. “When the powindah showed me this document | knew God had sent us a signal.”\n“Do the witches still deny authorship?” Torg the Younger asked.\nHow alertly apt he is, Waff thought.\n“Every powindah religion is called into question by this manifesto,” Waff said. “Every faith except ours is left hanging in limbo.”\n“Exactly the problem!” Mirlat pounced.\n“But only we know this,” Waff said. “Who else even suspects the existence of the Shariat?”\n“The Guild,” Mirlat said.\n“They have never spoken of it and they never will. They know what our response would be.”\nWaff lifted the sheaf of papers from his lap and again read aloud:\n“Forces that we cannot understand permeate our universe. We see the shadows of those forces when they are projected upon a screen available to our senses, but understand them we do not.”\n“The Atreides who wrote that knows of the Shariat,” Mirlat muttered.\nWaff continued reading as though there had been no interruption:\n“Understanding requires words. Some things cannot be reduced to words. There are things that can only be\nexperienced wordlessly.”\nAs though he handled a holy relic, Waff returned the document to his lap. Softly, so that his listeners were required to bend toward him and some cupped a hand behind an ear, Waff said: “This says our universe is magical. It says all arbitrary forms are transient and subject to magical changes. Science has led us to this interpretation as though it placed us on a track from which we cannot deviate.”\nHe allowed these words to fester for a moment, then: “No Rakian priest of the Divided God nor any other powindah charlatan can accept that. Only we know it because our God is a magical God whose language we speak.”\n“We will be accused of the authorship,” Mirlat said. The moment he had spoken, Mirlat shook his head sharply from side to side. “No! | see it. | see what you mean.”\nWaff held his silence. He could see that all of them were reflecting on their Sufi origins, recalling the Great Belief and the Zensunni ecumenism that had spawned the Bene Tleilax. The people of this kehl knew the God-given facts of their origins but generations of secrecy assured that no powindah shared their knowledge.\nWords flowed silently through Waff’s mind: “Assumptions based on understanding contain belief in an absolute ground out of which all things spring like plants growing from seeds.”\nKnowing that his councillors also recalled this catechism of the Great Belief, Waff reminded them of the Zensunni admonition.\n“Behind such assumptions lies a faith in words that the powindah do not question. Only the Shariat question and we do so silently.”\nHis councillors nodded in unison.\nWaff inclined his head slightly and continued: “The act of saying that things exist that cannot be described in words Shakes a universe where words are the supreme belief.”\n“Powindah poison!” his councillors shouted.\nHe had them all now and Waff hammered home his victory by demanding: “What is the Sufi-Zensunni Credo?”\nThey could not speak it but all reflected on it: 70 achieve s’torino understanding is needed. S’tori exists without words, without even a name.\nIn a moment, all of them looked up and exchanged knowing glances. Mirlat took it upon himself to recite the Tleilaxu pledge:\n“I can say God, but that is not my God. That is only a noise and no more potent than any other noise.”\n“|I now see,” Waff said, “that you all sense the power that has fallen into our hands through this document. Millions upon millions of copies already are being circulated among the powindah.”\n“Who does this?” Mirlat asked.\n“Who cares?” Waff countered. “Let the powindah chase after them, seeking their origin, trying to suppress them, preaching against them. With each such action, the powindah inject more power into these words.”\n“Should we not preach against these words, too?” Mirlat asked.\n“Only if the occasion demands it,” Waff said. “See you!” He slapped the papers against his knees. “The powindah have constricted their awareness to its tightest purpose and that is their weakness. We must insure that this manifesto gains as wide a circulation as possible.”\n“The magic of our God is our only bridge,” the councillors intoned.\nAll of them, Waff observed, had been restored to the central security of their faith. It had been easily managed. No Masheikh shared the powindah stupidity that whined: “In thy infinite grace, God, why me?” In one sentence, the powindah invoked infinity and denied it, never once observing their own foolishness.\n“Scytale,” Waff said.\nThe youngest and most baby-faced of the councillors, seated at the far left as was fitting, leaned forward eagerly.\n“Arm the faithful,” Waff said.\n“I marvel that an Atreides has given us this weapon,” Mirlat said. “How can it be that the Atreides always fasten upon an ideal that enlists the billions who must follow?”\n“It is not the Atreides, it is God,” Waff said. He lifted his arms then and spoke the closing ritual: “The Masheikh have met in kehl and felt the presence of their God.”\nWaff closed his eyes and waited for the others to leave. Masheikh! How good it was to name themselves in kehl, speaking the language of Islamiyat, which no Tleilaxu spoke outside his own secret councils; not even to Face Dancers did they speak it. Nowhere in the Wekht of Jandola, not to the farthest reaches of the Tleilaxu Yaghist, was there a living powindah who knew this secret.\nYaghist, Waff thought, rising from his bench. Yaghist, the land of the unruled.\nHe thought he could feel the document vibrating in his hand. This Atreides Manifesto was the very kind of thing the masses of powindah would follow to their doom.\nSome days it’s melange; some days it’s bitter dirt.\n—RAKIAN APHORISM\nn her third year with the priests of Rakis, the girl Sheeana\nlay full length atop a high curving dune. She peered into the morning distance where a great rumbling friction could be heard. The light was a ghostly silver that frosted the horizon with filmy haze. The night’s chill still lay on the sand.\nShe knew the priests were watching her from the safety of their water-girded tower some two kilometers behind her, but this gave her little concern. The trembling of the sand beneath her body demanded full attention.\nIt’s a big one, she thought. Seventy meters at least. A beautiful big one.\nThe gray stillsuit felt slick and smooth against her skin. It had none of the abrasive patches of the old hand-me-down she had worn before the priests took her into their care. She felt thankful for the fine stillsuit and the thick robe of white and purple that covered it, but most of all she felt the excitement of being here. Something rich and dangerous filled her at moments such as this.\nThe priests did not understand what happened here. She knew this. They were cowards. She glanced over her shoulder at the distant tower and saw sunglint on lenses.\nA precocious child of eleven standard years, slender and dark-skinned with sun-streaked brown hair, she could visualize clearly what the priests saw through their spying lenses.\nThey see me doing what they do not dare. They see me in the path of Shaitan. | look very small on the sand and Shaitan looks very big. They can see him already.\nFrom the rasping sound, she knew that she, too, would soon see the giant worm. Sheeana did not think of the approaching monster as Shai-hulud, God of the sands, a thing the priests chanted each morning in obeisance to the pearl of Leto Il’s awareness that lay encapsulated in each of the multi-ridged rulers of the desert. She thought of the worms mainly as “they who spared me,” or as Shaitan.\nThey belonged to her now.\nIt was a relationship begun slightly more than three years ago during the month of her eighth birthday, the Month Igat by the old calendar. Her village had been a poor one, a pioneer venture built far beyond more secure barriers such as the qanats and ring canals of Keen. Only a moat of damp sand guarded such pioneer places. Shaitan avoided water but the sandtrout vector soon took away any dampness. Precious moisture captured in windtraps had to be expended each day to renew the barrier. Her village was a miserable cluster of shacks and hovels with two small windtraps, adequate for drinking water but with only a sporadic surplus that could be apportioned to the worm barrier.\nThat morning—much like this morning, the night’s chill Sharp in her nose and lungs, the horizon constricted by a ghostly haze—most of the village children had fanned out into the desert, there to seek bits and fragments of melange, which Shaitan sometimes left behind in his passage. Two big ones had been heard nearby in the night. Melange, even at modern deflated prices, could buy the glazed bricks to line a third windtrap.\nEach searching child not only looked for the spice but also sought those signs which would reveal one of the old Fremen sietch strongholds. There were only remnants of such places now but the rock barriers provided a greater\nsecurity against Shaitan. And some of the remnant sietch places were reputed to contain lost hoards of melange. Every villager dreamed of such a discovery.\nSheeana, wearing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_202d221a209f8ffaf84e38393be68786423622057154394ab95fab7c1ecd5021_v2"}
