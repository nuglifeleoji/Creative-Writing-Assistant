Following these events, he remained in Arrakeen, where he took on the role of a dissident preacher, openly criticizing the established religious doctrines and the ruling powers. His presence in the city marked a significant shift, as he used his influence to challenge the status quo, advocating for reform and opposing the corruption he perceived in both faith and governance.  \n\nThus, THE PREACHER's connection to Arrakeen is twofold: first as a key figure in its military conflicts, and later as a vocal opponent of its ruling systems, shaping the city's ideological landscape through his teachings.
