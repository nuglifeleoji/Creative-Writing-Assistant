\n　　人生中还有什么打击能比得上年轻时候的失恋对人的打击呢？那时候，人常常感到整个世界都一片昏暗。尤其象田润叶这样的人，她尽管在县城参加了工作，但本质上也可以说仍然是一个农村姑娘。一旦当她第一次对一个男人产生了热烈的爱情，就会深陷进去而不能自拔。可一旦这热烈的向往落空，又很难从因此而造成的痛苦中解脱出来。她除过日常的生活和工作，又没有远大的事业上的追求来弥补感情上的损失…… \n　　当然，这样说，并不是说她就是一个饱食终日的庸人。不，我们的润叶对自己本职的工作始终尽职尽责，甚至充满了激情。她热爱孩子和教师职业，为了给学生们教好书，备课常常废寝忘食，有时直至夜半更深。至于工作中的一切规定、要求和任务，她更是模范地执行，兢兢业业地完成……勿容置疑，她是一个普普通通的人，她的思想、气质、感情，优点和缺点，都是属于普通人的。但普通人和出类拔萃的人一样，也有自己的欢乐和痛苦，只不过不为大多数人了解罢了。人们宁愿去关心一个蹩脚电影演员的吃喝拉撒和鸡毛蒜皮，而不愿了解一个普通人波涛汹涌的内心世界……此刻，田润叶的内心正如同汹涌的波涛一般翻腾着。少安的突然结婚，向前对她的没命追求，她二妈徐爱云和向前妈刘志英的轮番围困，现在又加了一个老将徐国强出马……如果少安没有结婚，不论有多少人进攻，她感情的阵地仍然会固若金汤。想不到，她在前方的战壕里拼命抵挡。但她为之而战的后方却自己烧成了一片火海……田润叶坐在这河岸上，望着春日里东去的流水，忍不住又勾起往日的情思来。她想起去年的现在，是她和少安两个人坐在这地方。她当时心儿是怎样嘣嘣地欢跳啊！可是一年以后的今天，她一个人坐在这里，胸膛里象装着一块冻冰。抬头望，桃花依然红，柳丝照旧绿；低头看，青草又发芽，水流还向东。可是，景似去年景，心如冰火再不同！ \n　　她耳边依稀又听见了那缠绵的信天游从远山飘来——正月里冻冰呀立春消，二月里鱼儿水上飘， \n　　水呀上飘来想起我的哥！ \n　　想起我的哥哥， \n　　想起我的哥哥， \n　　想起我的哥哥呀你等一等我……两行泪水再一次从她的眼睛里涌出来了。此时没有人唱这歌，但是她听见了。哥哥，亲爱的少安哥！你为什么不等一等我…… \n　　她最后一次和少安分手后，尽管少安在她的追求面前畏\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田润叶<|>PERSON<|>田润叶 is a young woman who works in a county but has rural
