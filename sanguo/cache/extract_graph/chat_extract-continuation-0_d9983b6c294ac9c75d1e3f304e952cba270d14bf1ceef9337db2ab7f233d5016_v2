于是发书致刘璋，只说曹操令部将乐进引兵至青泥镇，众将抵敌不住，吾当亲往拒之，不及面会，特书相辞。书至成都，张松听得说刘玄德欲回荆州，只道是真心，乃修书一封，欲令人送与玄德，却值亲兄广汉太守张肃到，松急藏书于袖中，与肃相陪说话。肃见松神情恍惚，心中疑惑。松取酒与肃共饮。献酬之间，忽落此书于地，被肃从人拾得。席散后，从人以书呈肃。肃开视之。书略曰：“松昨进言于皇叔，并无虚谬，何乃迟迟不发？逆取顺守，古人所贵。今大事已在掌握之中，何故欲弃此而回荆州乎？使松闻之，如有所失。书呈到日，疾速进兵。松当为内应，万勿自误！”张肃见了，大惊曰：“吾弟作灭门之事，不可不首。”连夜将书见刘璋，具言弟张松与刘备同谋，欲献西川。刘璋大怒曰：“吾平日未尝薄待他，何故欲谋反！”遂下令捉张松全家，尽斩于市。后人有诗叹曰：“一览无遗世所稀，谁知书信泄天机。未观玄德兴王业，先向成都血染衣。”\n\n    刘璋既斩张松，聚集文武商议曰：“刘备欲夺吾基业，当如之何？”黄权曰：“事不宜迟。即便差人告报各处关隘，添兵把守，不许放荆州一人一骑入关。”璋从其言，星夜驰檄各关去讫。却说玄德提兵回涪城，先令人报上涪水关，请杨怀，高沛出关相别。杨、高二将闻报，商议曰：“玄德此回若何？”高沛曰：“玄德合死。我等各藏利刃在身，就送行处刺之，以绝吾主之患。”杨怀曰：“此计大妙。”二人只带随行二百人，出关送行，其余并留在关上。\n\n    玄德大军尽发。前至涪水之上，庞统在马上谓玄德曰：“杨怀、高沛若欣然而来，可提防之；若彼不来，便起兵径取其关，不可迟缓。”正说间，忽起一阵旋风，把马前“帅”字旗吹倒。玄德问庞统曰：“此何兆也？”统曰：“此警报也，杨怀、高沛二人必有行刺之意，宜善防之。”玄德乃身披重铠，自佩宝剑防备。人报杨、高二将前来送行。玄德令军马歇定。庞统分付魏延、黄忠：“但关上来的军士，不问多少，马步军兵，一个也休放回。”二将得令而去。\n\n    却说杨怀、高沛二人身边各藏利刃，带二百军兵，牵羊送酒，直至军前。见并无准备，心中暗喜，以为中计。入至帐下、见玄德正与庞统坐于帐中。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>刘璋<|>PERSON<|>刘璋 is a
