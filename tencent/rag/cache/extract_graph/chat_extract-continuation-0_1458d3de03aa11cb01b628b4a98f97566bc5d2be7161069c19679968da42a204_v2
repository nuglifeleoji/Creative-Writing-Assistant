A Mentat could work without certain pieces if he had enough to create a pattern. Sometimes, the sketchiest outline was enough. It supplied the hidden shape and then he could fit the missing pieces to complete a whole. Mentats seldom had all the data they might desire, but he was trained to sense patterns, to recognize systems and wholeness. Teg reminded himself now that he also had been trained in the ultimate military sense: You trained a recruit to traina weapon, to aim the weapon correctly.\nTaraza was aiming him. His assessment of their situation had been confirmed.\n“Desperate attempts will be made to kill or capture our ghola before you can awaken him,” she said.\nHe recognized her tone: the coldly analytic offering of data to a Mentat. She saw that he was in Mentat mode,\nthen.\nThe Mentat pattern-search rolled through his mind. First, there was the Sisterhood’s design for the ghola, largely unknown to him, but ranging somehow around the presence of a young female on Rakis who (so they said) could command worms. Idaho gholas: charming persona and with something else that had made the Tyrant and the Tleilaxu repeat him countless times. Duncans by the shipload! What service did this ghola provide that the Tyrant had not let him remain among the dead? And the Tleilaxu: They had decanted Duncan Idaho gholas from their axlotl tanks for millennia, even after the death of the Tyrant. The Tleilaxu had sold this ghola to the Sisterhood twelve times and the Sisterhood had paid in the hardest currency: melange from their own precious stores. Why did the Tleilaxu accept in payment something they produced so copiously? Obvious: to deplete the Sisterhood’s supplies. A special form of greed there. The Tleilaxu were buying supremacy—a power game!\nTeg focused on the quietly waiting Mother Superior. “The Tleilaxu have been killing our gholas to control our timing,” he said.\nTaraza nodded but did not speak. So there was more. Once again, he fell into Mentat mode.\nThe Bene Gesserit were a valuable market for the Tleilaxu melange, not the only source because there was always the trickle from Rakis, but valuable, yes; very valuable. It was not reasonable that the Tleilaxu would alienate a valuable market unless they had a more valuable market standing ready.\nWho else had an interest in Bene Gesserit activities? The Ixians without a doubt. But Ixians were not a good market for melange. The Ixian presence on this ship spoke of their independence. Since Ixians and Fish Speakers made common cause, the Fish Speakers could be set aside from this pattern quest.\nWhat great power or assemblage of powers in this universe possessed...\nTeg froze that thought as though he had applied the dive brakes in a ‘thopter, letting his mind float free while he sorted other considerations.\nNot in this universe.\nThe pattern took shape. Wea/th. Gammu assumed a new role in his Mentat computations. Gammu had been gutted long ago by the Harkonnens, abandoned as a festering carcass, which the Danians had restored. There was a time, though, when even Gammu’s hopes were gone. Without hopes there had not even been dreams. Climbing from that cesspool, the population had employed only the basest pragmatism. /f it works, it is good.\nWealth.\nIn his first survey of Gammu he had noted the numbers of banking houses. They were even marked, some of them, as Bene Gesserit-safe. Gammu served as the fulcrum for manipulation of enormous wealth. The bank he had visited to study its use aS an emergency contact came back fully into his Mentat awareness. He had realized at once that the place did not confine itself to purely planetary business. It was a bankers’ bank.\nNot just wealth but WEALTH.\nA Prime Pattern development did not come into Teg’s mind but he had enough for a Testing Projection. Wealth not of this universe. People from the Scattering.\nAll of this Mentat sorting had taken only a few seconds. Having reached a testing point, Teg set himself loose-of- muscle and nerve, glanced once at Taraza and strode across to the concealed entry. He noted that Taraza gave no sign of alarm at his movements. Whipping aside the hangings, Teg confronted a man almost as tall as himself: military-style clothing with crossed spears at the collar tabs. The face was heavy, the jaws wide; green eyes. A look of surprised\nalertness, one hand poised above a pocket that bulged obviously with a weapon.\nTeg smiled at the man, let the hangings fall and returned to Taraza.\n“We are being observed by people from the Scattering,” he said.\nTaraza relaxed. Teg’s performance had been memorable. The hangings swished aside. The tall stranger entered and stopped about two paces from Teg. A glacial expression\nof anger gripped his features.\n“|I warned you not to tell him!” The voice was a grating baritone with an accent new to Teg.\n“And | warned you about the powers of this Mentat Bashar,” Taraza said. A look of loathing flashed across her features.\nThe man subsided and a subtle look of fear came over his face. “Honored Matre, I|—”\n“Don’t you dare call me that!” Taraza’s body tensed ina fighting posture that Teg had never before seen her display.\nThe man inclined his head slightly. “Dear lady, you do not control the situation here. | must remind you that my orders\nTeg had heard enough. “Through me, she does control here,” he said. “Before coming here | set certain protective measures in motion. This...” he glanced around him and returned his attention to the intruder, whose face now bore a wary expression “...is not a no-ship. Two of our no-ship monitors have you in their sights at this moment.”\n“You would not survive!” the man barked.\nTeg smiled amiably. “No one on this ship would survive.” He clenched his jaw to key the nerve signal and activate the tiny pulsetimer in his skull. It played its graphic signals against his visual centers. “And you don’t have much time in which to make a decision.”\n“Tell him how you knew to do this,” Taraza said.\n“The Mother Superior and | have our own private means of communication,” Teg said. “But further than that, there was no need for her to warn me. Her Summons was enough. The Mother Superior on a Guild Transport at a time like this? Impossible!”\n“Impasse,” the man growled.\n“Perhaps,” Teg said. “But neither Guild nor Ix will risk a total and all-out attack by Bene Gesserit forces under the command of a leader trained by me. | refer to the Bashar Burzmali. Your Support has just dissolved and vanished.”\n“I told him nothing of this,” Taraza said. “You have just witnessed the performance of a Mentat Bashar, which | doubt could be equaled in your universe. Think of that if you consider going against Burzmali, a man trained by this Mentat.”\nThe intruder looked from Taraza to Teg and back to Taraza.\n“This is the way out of our seeming impasse,” Teg said. “The Mother Superior Taraza and her entourage leave with me. You must decide immediately. Time is running out.”\n“You're bluffing.” There was no force in the words.\nTeg faced Taraza and bowed. “It has been a great honor to serve you, Reverend Mother Superior. | bid you farewell.” “Perhaps death will not part us,” Taraza said. It was the\ntraditional farewell of a Reverend Mother to a Sister-equal.\n“Go!” The heavy-featured man dashed to the corridor hatchway and flung it open, revealing two Ixian guards, looks of surprise on their faces. His voice hoarse, the man ordered: “Take them to their lighter.”\nStill relaxed and calm, Teg said: “Summon your people, Mother Superior.” To the man standing at the hatchway, Teg said: “You value your own skin too much to be a good soldier. None of my people would have made such an error.”\n“There are true Honored Matres aboard this ship,” the man grated. “I am sworn to protect them.”\nTeg grimaced and turned to where Taraza was leading her people from the adjoining room: two Reverend Mothers and four acolytes. Teg recognized one of the Reverend Mothers: Darwi Odrade. He had seen her before only at a distance but the oval face and lovely eyes were arresting: so like Lucilla.\n“Do we have time for introductions?” Taraza asked.\n“Of course, Mother Superior.”\nTeg nodded and grasped the hand of each woman as Taraza presented them.\nAs they left, Teg turned to the uniformed stranger. “One must always observe the niceties,” Teg said. “Otherwise we are less than human.”\nNot until they were on the lighter, Taraza seated beside him and her entourage nearby, did Teg ask the overriding question.\n“How did they take you?”\nThe lighter was plunging planetward. The screen in front of Teg showed that the Ix-branded Guildship obeyed his command to remain in orbit until his party was safely behind its planetary defenses.\nBefore Taraza could respond, Odrade leaned across the aisle separating them and said: “I have countermanded the Bashar’s orders to destroy that Guildship, Mother.”\nTeg swiveled his head sharply and glared at Odrade. “But they took you captive and . . .” He scowled. “How did you know |—”\n“Miles!”\nTaraza’s voice conveyed overwhelming reproof. He grinned ruefully. Yes, she knew him almost as well as he knew himself... better in some respects.\n“They did not just capture us, Miles,” Taraza said. “We allowed ourselves to be taken. Ostensibly, | was escorting Dar to Rakis. We left our no-ship at Junction and asked for the fastest Guild Transport. All of my Council, including Burzmali, agreed that these intruders from the Scattering\nwould subvert the Transport and take us to you, aiming to pick up all the pieces of the ghola project.”\nTeg was aghast. The risk!\n“We knew you would rescue us,” Taraza said. “Burzmali was standing by in case you failed.”\n“That Guildship you’ve spared,” Teg said, “will summon assistance and attack our—”\n“They will not attack Gammu,” Taraza said. “Too many diverse forces from the Scattering are assembled on Gammu. They would not dare alienate so many.”\n“I wish | were as certain of that as you appear to be,” Teg said.\n“Be certain, Miles. Besides, there are other reasons for not destroying the Guildship. Ix and the Guild have been caught taking sides. That’s bad for business and they need all of the business they can get.”\n“Unless they have more important customers offering greater profits!”\n“Ahhhhh, Miles.” She spoke in a musing voice. “What we latter-day Bene Gesserit really do is try to let matters achieve a calmer tone, a balance. You know this.”\nTeg found this true but he locked on one phrase: “...latter- day...” The words conveyed a sense of Ssummation-at- death. Before he could question this, Taraza continued:\n“We like to settle the most passionate situations off the battlefield. | must admit we have the Tyr\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MENTAT<|>PERSON<|>A Mentat is a human trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers, capable of pattern recognition and strategic analysis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a Mentat Bashar, a military leader trained in strategic thinking and combat, currently involved in a high-stakes mission involving the Bene Gesserit and a ghola>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, orchestrating a complex plan involving a ghola and confronting threats from the Scattering>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with political, genetic, and mystical influence across the universe>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A manipulative faction known for creating gholas and controlling melange production, often in conflict with the Bene Gesserit>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>A desert planet central to the ghola project and home to sandworms, a source of melange>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet restored from ruin, now a hub of banking and wealth manipulation, key to the Bene Gesserit's plans>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>A diaspora of humans who fled into uncharted space, now returning with unknown motives and power>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GHOLA PROJECT<|>EVENT<|>A Bene Gesserit initiative involving the resurrection of Duncan Idaho, tied to political and economic power struggles>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>TARAZA<|>Teg serves Taraza as a Mentat Bashar, executing her strategic plans with loyalty and precision<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza leads the Bene Gesserit as Mother Superior, directing their political and genetic schemes<|>10>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Tleilaxu supply gholas and melange to the Bene Gesserit while secretly undermining them<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GHOLA PROJECT<|>Teg is tasked with protecting and awakening the ghola, a linchpin in the Bene Gesserit's plans<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>RAKIS<|>GHOLA PROJECT<|>Rakis is linked to the ghola project through a young female who commands worms, a critical element<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GAMMU<|>SCATTERING<|>Gammu hosts forces from the Scattering, making it a nexus of wealth and conflict<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>SCATTERING<|>Taraza confronts threats from the Scattering, including the Honored Matres<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>SCATTERING<|>Teg identifies and counters agents from the Scattering, protecting Bene Gesserit interests<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
