“谢谢，不过你真的不用这么客气。”\n    “这不是客气。是我想见她，我想见你女儿。”说着工藤边喝咖啡，边意有所指地看她。\n    他邀她吃饭时，就主动表示欢迎她女儿一起来。靖子感觉得到，他这话是出自真心，他的诚意令她开心。\n    问题是，她不可能带美里一起来。美里不喜欢这种场合固然是事实，不过更重要的是，非属必要她不想让女儿看到自己在工藤面前恢复女人本色的那一面。\n    “工藤先生女自己呢？不和家人一起用餐没关系吗？”\n    “你说我吗？”工藤放下咖啡杯，双肘撑在桌上，“我就是想跟你谈这件事，所以今天才会找你出来吃饭。”\n    靖子侧首不解地凝视对方。\n    “老实说，我现在是孤家寡人。”\n    “啊？”靖子不禁讶异，双眼也瞪的老大。\n    “我老婆得了癌症，是胰脏癌。虽然开了刀，还是为时已晚。结果去年夏天，她就过世了。因为还年轻，所以扩散得也快，一转眼就恶化了。”\n    工藤语气很平淡，也许因为这样，这番话在靖子听来毫无真实感。足足有好几秒，她就这样茫然的瞪着她。\n    “你说的是真的吗？”她费尽力气才挤出这句话。\n    “要开玩笑，我可说不出这种话。”他笑了。\n    “是没错，可是该怎么说……”她垂下脸，舔舔嘴唇才抬起脸，“那真是呃……请节哀顺变，你一定很辛苦吧？”\n    “一言难尽。不过正如我刚才说的，真的是一转眼就过去了。起先她只是嚷着腰痛去医院挂号，然后医生就突然把我叫去告诉我病情。住院，开刀，照顾病人――简直像被放\n\n在自动传送带上一样。时间就这么迷迷糊糊地过去了，然后她就过世了，然后她就过世了。她自己知不知道病因，现在已成了永远不可解的谜题。”说着工藤拿起水杯喝了口水。\n    “她是什么时候发现生病的？”\n    工藤歪着头，“前年……年底吧？”\n    “那，我那时还在‘玛丽安’嘛。工藤先生，你不是还来店里捧场？”\n    工藤苦笑着，晃晃肩膀。\n    “很不像话吧？老婆性命垂危之际，做老公的的确不该上酒家喝酒。”\n    靖子浑身僵硬，一时之间想不出该说什么。工藤当时在店里的开朗笑容在她脑海浮现。\n    “不过，如果容许我辩解的话，正因为发生了这种事让我身心俱疲，才会见你想稍微得到一点慰藉吧。”他抓抓偷，皱起鼻子。\n    �\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>工藤<|>PERSON<|>工藤 is a man who is
