Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron—he will encounter a small tooth.\nThere is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.\n—FROM “INTRODUCTION TO A CHILD’S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport\nof the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work.\nExplosive artillery.\nThe guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke’s fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination—and the Duke’s men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.\nThe Baron could feel the distant chomping—a drumbeat carried to him through the ship’s metal: broomp...broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!\nWho would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke’s men would run for those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.\nHe adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls.\nA pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke’s, he thought. He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.\nA door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-blackened viewport before turning.\nPiter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Baron’s personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheeplike in his presence.\nThe Baron turned.\nPiter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. “Good news, m’Lord. The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.”\n“Of course they have,” the Baron rumbled.\nHe studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter’s effeminate face. And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.\nSoon | must remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then—they will welcome my darling Feyd- Rautha as a savior.\nThe Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain—Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe—a man to be trusted because the captain’s vices were known.\n“First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?” the Baron asked. “I must give the traitor his reward.”\nPiter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.\nA bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron.\n“Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.”\n“M’Lord Harkonnen.”\n“You've given us the Duke, | hear.”\n“My half of the bargain, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron looked at Piter.\nPiter nodded.\nThe Baron looked back at Yueh. “The letter of the bargain, eh? And l....” He spat the words out: “What was | to do in return?”\n“You remember quite well, m’Lord Harkonnen.”\nAnd Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron’s manner. Wanna was indeed dead—gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there’d still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron’s manner showed there was no hold; it was ended.\n“Do |?” the Baron asked.\n“You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.”\nThe Baron nodded. “Oh, yes. Now, | remember. So | did. That was my promise. That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn’t endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter’s pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises. | told you I’d free her from the agony and permit you to join her. So be it.” He waved a hand at Piter.\nPiter’s blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was Catlike in its sudden fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh’s back.\nThe old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron.\n“So join her!” the Baron spat.\nYueh stood, swaying. His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: “You...think...you...de...feated...me. You... think...|...did...not...know...what...|...bo0ught...for... my...Wanna.”\nHe toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling.\n“So join her,” the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.\nYueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.\nSo that’s how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. /t’s well to know.\n“He did give us the Duke?” the Baron asked.\n“Of a certainty, my Lord,” Piter said.\n“Then get him in here!”\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.\nThe Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones.\n“I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,” the Baron said. “Not even a traitor | created.”\nHe glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron’s mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain white.\nBut there was still the feeling of doubt.\nWhat had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he’d probably known what would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he’d been defeated: “You think you defeated me.”\nWhat had he meant?\nThe Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains, the eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke’s eyes held a glazed, insane look.\n“Wel-I-I-I,” the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long-envisioned, had lost some of its Savor.\nDamn that cursed doctor through all eternity!\n“I believe the good Duke is drugged,” Piter said. “That’s how Yueh caught him for us.” Piter turned to the Duke. “Aren’t you drugged, my dear Duke?”\nThe voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.\n“What of the woman and the boy, Piter?” the Baron asked. “Any word yet?”\nPiter’s tongue darted over his lips.\n“You've heard something!” the Baron snapped. “What?”\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. “The men who were sent to do the job, m’Lord —they’ve...ah...been...ah...found.”\n“Well, they report everything satisfactory?”\n“They're dead, m’Lord.”\n“Of course they are! What | want to know is—”\n“They were dead when found, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron’s face went livid. “And the woman and boy?”\n“No sign, m’Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being investigated. Perhaps it’s as we wished—an accident. Possibly—”\n“We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing ‘thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?”\n“One of the Duke’s men obviously escaped in it, m’Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped.”\n“Which of the Duke’s men?”\n“It was a Clean, silent killing, m’Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant.”\n“Possibilities,” the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke.\n“The situation is in hand, m’Lord,” Piter said.\n“No, it isn’t! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?”\n“We've word where to find him and he’s been sent for, m’Lord.”\n“I don’t like the way the Emperor’s servant is helping us,” the Baron muttered.\nThey were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto’s mind. Woman and boy —no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.\n“Where is the ducal signet ring?” the Baron demanded. “His finger is bare.”\n“The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,” the guard captain said.\n“You killed the doctor too soon,” the Baron said. “That was a mistake. You should’ve warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.” He scowled. “Possibilities!”\nThe thought hung like a sine wave in Leto’s mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it.\nThe tooth!\nHe remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.\nSomeone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it.\nNot yet!\nThe someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn't remember.\n“How long will he remain drugged like this?” the Baron asked.\n“Perhaps another hour, m’Lord.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. “I am hungry.”\nThat’s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BARON VLADIMIR HARKONNEN<|>PERSON<|>The Baron is a powerful and ruthless leader, orchestrating the attack on Duke Leto Atreides and his men.
