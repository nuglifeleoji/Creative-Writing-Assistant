季洪彬淡淡的道：“今天上午，全都是我的课。前一半时间，我来讲课。后一半对你们进行考核。考核合格的可以去吃午饭。不合格的就一直考到合格。”\n\n    “啊……”哀叹声顿时传遍全班。\n\n    蓝轩宇这才再次趁机会向钱磊问道：“季老师究竟是教什么的啊？”\n\n    钱磊嘴角一抽，“季老师是教魂兽基础知识的。大家刚开始的时候都觉得这门课程没什么用，毕竟我们接触魂兽的机会恐怕只有在模拟舱中了。可开始上了他的课才知道这位老师有多么严格。更可怕的是，据说季老师是咱们天罗学院第一强者，谁也惹不起。他还是学院副院长。然后，每次他教的东西都特别多、特别驳杂，还非要我们记住，每堂课都要考核。考核不过，那惩罚就来了，五花八门的。”\n\n    魂兽基础知识？听到这课程的名字他不禁松了口气。\n\n    家学渊源的关系，他最熟悉的可不就是魂兽么？从小到大，耳濡目染之下，父母都是古魂兽研究所的。可以说，他绝对是全班对魂兽最熟悉的人了。\n\n    “开始上课。今天我要给你们讲的是，魂兽等级、以及顶级魂兽特性。”\n\n    季洪彬开始上课了。\n\n    “众所周知，魂兽自古以来都是按照修炼年限进行分类的，从而有了十年魂兽、百年魂兽、千年魂兽、万年魂兽和十万年魂兽。但是，在我们魂师的历史上，还有一些较为特殊的存在。这五类魂兽对应的魂环颜色分别是白色、黄色、紫色、黑色和红色。可是，我们的魂环还有一些特殊颜色的出现。下面给大家举几个例子。”\n\n    “首先，特殊颜色魂环出现次数最多的，就是橙金色魂环。十万年以上层次，尤其是达到了二十万年以上的魂兽，被称之为凶兽。它们所产生的魂环就是橙金色的。所以，橙金色往往意味着强大，十万年红色魂环会赋予魂师两个魂技，而橙金色魂环会有可能更多。当然，这是远古时代，现在我们所吸收的魂灵本身也是多个魂技，但需要对应不同等级。而这种顶级魂环，是一个魂环就拥有几个魂技。”\n\n    “以目前传灵塔的科技，已经勉强能够模拟制作出十万年魂环了。但是，橙金色魂环却在研究下来发现，是永远不可能模拟出来的。因为所有凶兽都是要经历不同的天劫才能提升到那个层次，天劫无法模拟。”\n\n    “除了橙金色之外，还有一些更为罕见的魂环，而且是无法确定是否出现过的。譬如，传说中的百万年魂环。”\n\n    “百万年魂环历史上第一次有传说，来自于唐门的创始祖先唐三。据说，海�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>季洪彬<|>PERSON<|>季洪彬 is a strict teacher at 天罗学院, known for his
