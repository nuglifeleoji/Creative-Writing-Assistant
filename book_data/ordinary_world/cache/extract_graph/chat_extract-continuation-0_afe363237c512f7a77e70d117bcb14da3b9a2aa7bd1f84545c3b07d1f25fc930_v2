��办？这时候，死者娘家门上来的人，哪怕是三岁娃娃，在孝子面前都是权威人士，象君主立宪国的皇室成员，神圣不可侵犯。如果他们中任何一个人从中作梗，孝子们就别想让老人入土！ \n　　现在，俊武两个七十来岁的老舅舅盘腿坐在炕头，身后是其他小辈的“皇室成员”，一个个都不由自主摆出高高在上的架式。 \n　　金俊武领头跪在炕栏下的脚地上。他身后跪着自己的妻子李玉玲和大嫂张桂兰。按下来是金强和俊武两个上学的儿女。其他孝子们从脚地上一直跪到了门外的院子里。其阵势真有点象群臣跪拜新登基的皇上。 \n　　俊武先概要地向娘舅家的人汇报了他们生前照顾老人的情况，其中当然也有一些必要的检讨。接着，他又详细叙说这次是如何操办母亲丧事的。最后，他请求舅舅们提出意见；如有不满足，他将尽力弥补缺憾。 \n　　接下来，孝子们就敛声屏气，等待娘舅家的质询了。 \n　　在这种情况下，死者娘家的人多少总要提点意见，向孝子们发难：俗称“抖亏欠”。 \n　　为首的大舅庄严地盘腿坐在炕头，搭拉着松驰的眼皮，象老法官一般沉吟着说：“其它嘛，也就不说了。我姐和我姐夫东拉河一道沟谁不知道他们的好名声？如今，他们入土合葬，你们为什么不给他们做个道场，让礼生来唱唱礼呢？” \n　　所有孝子们的心都在咚咚跳着，他们想不到这老家伙竟提出了如此高的要求。俊武的媳妇李玉玲头叩在地上，心里骂道：“老不死的东西！看你死了还耍个什么花子！”俊武给大舅磕了三头，回话说：“本该按你老说的这样做，只是咱们周围请不下和尚道士，要做道场，只能到白云山去请礼生，但路太远，还不知人家来不来……” \n　　他大舅合住眼一言不发——这等于拒绝了外甥的理由。事情眼看着陷入了僵局。 \n　　这时候，二舅咳嗽了一声，扭头看了看他哥，说：“也就不要再为难娃娃了。俊武为办他妈的丧事，已经尽了力这我们能看见……” \n　　二舅是个明白人，主动为外甥开脱。 \n　　大舅沉默了一会，抬起眼皮说：“那就这样吧，起来……” \n　　金俊武和所有孝子都赶忙向炕上这一群严厉的审判官磕头谢恩。 \n　　迎完村民们送的挽帐和祭饭后，就要起丧了。 \n　　八个壮汉涌前来准备抬棺木，前面两人手提长条板凳，以备抬棺人路上歇息时停灵。 \n　　米家镇已故米阴阳的儿子继承了父业，现在是周围最有名气\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金俊武<|>PERSON<|>金俊武 is the
