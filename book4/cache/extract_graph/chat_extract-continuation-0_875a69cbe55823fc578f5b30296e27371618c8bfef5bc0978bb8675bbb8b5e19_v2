\n　　她把他的钉鞋工具通常都寄存在对面的饭铺，然后就扶他坐上轮椅。她推着他，走过了熙熙攘攘的人群，走过了夕阳辉映的桔红的大街…… \n                  第43章\n　　润叶在四月上旬顺利地生下了一个儿子。 \n　　三十一岁生头胎孩子，往是令人担心的。临产前四五天，婆婆刘志英就坚持让她住进了自己任党委书记的黄原市医院。妇产科最好的大夫已经做好了剖腹产的准备。结果孩子却顺利地自然出生了。 \n　　孩子取名“乐乐”，官名李乐。 \n　　乐乐的出生确实乐坏了这家人。母子从医院回家后，向前高兴得哭一阵又笑一阵。李登云和刘志英更不用说，他们不仅雇了保姆，而且两口子都失去了上班的热情，在整个月子里轮流帮保姆侍候小孙子和儿媳妇。向前满怀激情，以轮椅代步，一天忙着亲手做六七顿饭。 \n　　儿子的出生，使润叶真正体验到了一种更为丰富和深刻人生内涵。一个过了三十岁的女人，第一次做了母亲，那心情完全可以想得来。 \n　　现在，她已经上班了。再有一个星期，乐乐就过“百日”。 \n　　去年秋末，润叶由原来的少儿部长提成了团地委副书记，因为工作责任重大，也更繁忙了。她主要还是管少儿部和文体方面的工作，经常要组织一些学生职工的娱乐活动和体育比赛。 \n　　关于她的提拔，社会上也有一些攻击性的传言，说她是她二爸调到省上后，逼着让黄原地委提拔的。另一种传言是，地委有人为了讨好升迁的田福军，便想提拔了他的侄女，前一种说法显然是恶意制造的谣言，至于是否有人为了讨好田福军而在提拔她的问题上“做了工作”，我们就不得而知了。但愿不是这样。 \n　　不管怎样，对田润叶来说，她在生活和工作中都面临新的考验。她要照顾孩子，还要照顾残废的丈夫；新的职务又要求她在工作中投入更多的精力。团的工作的特点是社会性强，她得经常离开机关，到外面去活动。 \n　　好在孩子的许多事不要她过分操心。丈夫，公公和婆婆，加上保姆，四个相帮着抚哺，公公和婆婆把乐乐象命根子一样看待，孩子正常哭几声，婆婆就赶忙把医生叫到了家里——反正她管着一群医生！ \n　　润叶基本没有奶汁，因此不必经常跑回家给孩子喂奶。公公和婆婆为了照顾儿子和孙子，已经把宿舍调整到了他们单位下面\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>贾冰<|>PERSON<|>贾冰 is a character who sells
