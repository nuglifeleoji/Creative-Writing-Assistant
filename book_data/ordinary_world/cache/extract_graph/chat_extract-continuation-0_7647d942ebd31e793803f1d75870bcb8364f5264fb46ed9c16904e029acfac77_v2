\n　　王满银听见少安的声音，慌忙一闪身站起来。他把破呢子帽檐往头顶上扶了扶，咧开嘴不好意思地笑了笑，对小舅子说：“……你姐走后，家里就没柴烧了。我两天没放火，窑里冷得不行，就到这地方来晒一晒太阳……” \n　　少安气得顿时都说不出话来了。 \n　　王满银倒来了神，说：“哈呀，我猜出来了！你大概到石圪节置办结婚的东西去呀？听说你媳妇是山西柳林的？那地方我去过！好地方！那年武斗正乱的时候，我到柳林还买过一箱‘红金’烟呢！返回到无定河的时候，哈呀，又碰上……” \n　　“没柴烧你不能上山砍一把吗？”少安打断他的话说。 \n　　满银吱唔着说：“旱了一年，山上没长起来柴草……”“那你连饭也不做吗？” \n　　“没做……你姐走时留下几个干粮，我就到邻家锅里热一下……” \n　　啊呀，天下哪里还有这样的庄稼人！少安真想破口臭骂一通这个二流子，但歪好还算自己的姐夫，只好忍住一肚子火气，说：“是这个样子的话，那你到我们家里去嘛！”王满银倒象个人似的说：“你们这两天忙乱，我去给你们帮不上手。再说，你姐和两个娃娃都去了，我去连个住处也没有。等你办事那天我再去，过完事当天就返回来了……” \n　　少安只好离开他姐夫这个天然“取暖”地方，自个儿又向石圪节走去——让那个二流子自作自受去吧！ \n　　孙少安来到石圪节供销社，买了十来瓶廉价的瓶装酒和五条纸烟，又买了一些做肉的大茴和花椒。 \n　　置办完这些东西以后，他想到应该去一趟公社，给他的同学刘根民打个招呼，让他到时去参加他的婚礼。根民和他、润叶，都是一块在石圪节上高小的，后来根民又到县城上完中学，被录用成了国家干部，一直在石圪节公社当文书。他俩在学校时关系比较密切，这几年虽然根民成了干部，但对他也不摆架子，两个人还象学校时那样要好。 \n　　可少安又想：他和秀莲还要来公社领结婚证，根民是文书，登记结婚还要经他手，到时候再邀请也不迟。于是他就打消了去公社的念头，扛着那个沉甸甸的褡裢，准备回家了。 \n　　当他从石圪节清冷的土街上走过来，到了街上的理发店门前时，突然停住了脚步。他心想：我要不要进去理个发呢？他在这理发店门前犹豫了半天。他从来也没花钱理过发。平时头发长了，总是让大队会计田海民理一下。海民自己有一套理发家具，一般不给别人理。但只要他开口，海民都从不拒绝，有时还主动招呼\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
