possession. | tell you we are a marvel and my memories leave no doubt of this.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe woman working at the small wall desk was too big for\nthe narrow chair on which she perched. Outside, it was mid-morning, but in this windowless room deep beneath the city of Onn there was but a single glowglobe high ina corner. It had been tuned to warm yellow but the light failed to dispel the gray utility of the small room. Walls and ceiling were covered by identical rectangular panels of dull gray metal.\nThere was only one other piece of furniture, a narrow cot with a thin pallet covered by a featureless gray blanket. It was obvious that neither piece of furniture had been designed for the occupant.\nShe wore a one-piece pajama Suit of dark blue which stretched tightly across her wide shoulders as she hunched over the desk. The glowglobe illuminated closely cropped blonde hair and the right side of her face, emphasizing the square block of jaw. The jaw moved with silent words as her thick fingers carefully depressed the keys of a thin keyboard on the desk. She handled the machine with a deference which had originated as awe and moved reluctantly into fearsome excitement. Long familiarity with the machine had eliminated neither emotion.\nAs she wrote, words appeared on a screen concealed within the wall rectangle exposed by the downward folding of the desk.\n“Siona continues actions which predict violent attack on Your Holy Person,” she wrote. “Siona remains unswerving in her avowed purpose. She told me today that she will give copies of the stolen books to groups whose loyalty to You cannot be trusted. The named recipients are the Bene Gesserit, the Guild and the Ixians. She says the books contain Your enciphered words and, by this gift, she seeks help in translating Your Holy Words.\n“Lord, | do not know what great revelations may be concealed on those pages but if they contain anything of threat to Your Holy Person, | beg You to relieve me from my vow of obedience to Siona. | do not understand why You made me take this vow, but | fear it.\n“I remain Your worshipful servant, Nayla.”\nThe chair creaked as Nayla sat back and thought about her words. The room fell into the almost soundless withdrawal of thick insulation. There was only Nayla’s faint breathing and a distant throbbing of machinery felt more in the floor than in the air.\nNayla stared at her message on the screen. Destined only for the eyes of the God Emperor, it required more than holy truthfulness. It demanded a deep candor which she found draining. Presently, she nodded and pressed the key which would encode the words and prepare them for transmission. Bowing her head, she prayed silently before concealing the desk within the wall. These actions, she knew, transmitted the message. God himself had implanted a physical device within her head, swearing her to secrecy and warning her that there might come a time when he would speak to her through the thing within her skull. He had never done this. She suspected that Ixians had fashioned the device. It had possessed some of their /ook. But God Himself had done this thing and she could ignore the suspicion that there might be\na computer in it, that it might be prohibited by the Great Convention.\n“Make no device in the likeness of the mind!”\nNayla shuddered. She stood then and moved her chair to its regular position beside the cot. Her heavy, muscular body strained against the thin blue garment. There was a steady deliberation about her, the actions of someone constantly adjusting to great physical strength. She turned at the cot and studied the place where the desk had been. There was only a rectangular gray panel like all the others. No bit of lint, no strand of hair, nothing caught there to reveal the panel’s secret.\nNayla took a deep, restorative breath and let herself out of the room’s only door into a gray passage dimly lighted by widely spaced white glowglobes. The machinery sounds were louder here. She turned left and a few minutes later was with Siona in a somewhat larger room, a table at its center upon which things stolen from the Citadel had been arranged. Two silvery glowglobes illuminated the scene— Siona seated at the table, with an assistant named Topri standing beside her.\nNayla nurtured grudging admiration for Siona, but Topri, there was a man worthy of nothing except active dislike. He was a nervous fat man with bulging green eyes, a pug nose and thin lips above a dimpled chin. Topri squeaked when he spoke.\n“Look here, Nayla! Look what Siona has found pressed between the pages of these two books.”\nNayla closed and locked the room’s single door.\n“You talk too much, Topri,” Nayla said. “You’re a blurter. How could you know if | was alone in the passage?”\nTopri paled. An angry scowl settled onto his face.\n“I’m afraid she’s right,” Siona said. “What made you think | wanted Nayla to know about my discovery?”\n“You trust her with everything!”\nSiona turned her attention to Nayla. “Do you know why | trust you, Nayla?” The question was asked in a flat, unemotional voice.\nNayla put down a sudden surge of fear. Had Siona discovered her secret?\nHave | failed my Lord?\n“Have you no response to my question?” Siona asked.\n“Have | ever given you cause to do otherwise?” Nayla asked.\n“That’s not a sufficient cause for trust,” Siona said. “There’s no such thing as perfection—not in human or machine.”\n“Then why do you trust me?”\n“Your words and your actions always agree. It’s a marvelous quality. For instance, you don’t like Topri and you never try to conceal your dislike.”\nNayla glanced at Topri, who cleared his throat.\n“| don’t trust him,” Nayla said.\nThe words popped into her mind and out of her mouth without reflection. Only after she had spoken did Nayla realize the true core of her dislike: Topri would betray anyone for personal gain.\nHas he found me out?\nStill scowling, Topri said, “I am not going to stand here and accept your abuse.” He started to leave but Siona held up a restraining hand. Topri hesitated.\n“Although we speak the old Fremen words and swear our loyalty to each other, that is not what holds us together,” Siona said. “Everything is based on performance. That is all | measure. Do you understand, both of you?”\nTopri nodded automatically, but Nayla shook her head from side to side.\nSiona smiled up at her. “You don’t always agree with my decisions, do you, Nayla?”\n“No.” The word was forced from her.\n“And you have never tried to conceal your disagreement, yet you always obey me. Why?”\n“That is what | have sworn to do.”\n“But | have said this is not enough.”\nNayla knew she was perspiring, knew this was revealing, but she could not move. What am I to do? | swore to God that | would obey Siona but I cannot tell her this.\n“You must answer my question,” Siona said. “I command it.”\nNayla caught her breath. This was the dilemma she had most feared. There was no way out. She said a silent prayer and spoke in a low voice.\n“I have sworn to God that | will obey you.”\nSiona clapped her hands in glee and laughed.\n“I knew it!”\nTopri chuckled.\n“Shut up, Topri,” Siona said. “I am trying to teach you a lesson. You don’t believe in anything, not even in yourself.”\n“Butl...”\n“Be still, | say! Nayla believes. | believe. This is what holds us together. Belief.”\nTopri was astonished. “Belief? You believe in...”\n“Not in the God Emperor, you fool! We believe that a higher power will settle with the tyrant worm. We are that higher power.”\nNayla took a trembling breath.\n“It’s all right, Nayla,” Siona said. “I don’t care where you draw your strength, just as long as you believe.”\nNayla managed a smile, then grinned. She had never been more profoundly stirred by the wisdom of her Lord. / may speak the truth and it works only for my God!\n“Let me show you what I’ve found in these books,” Siona said. She gestured at some sheets of ordinary paper on the table. “Pressed between the pages.”\nNayla stepped around the table and looked down at it.\n“First, there’s this.” Siona held up an object which Nayla had not noticed. It was a thin strand of something... and what appeared to bea...\n“A flower?” Nayla asked.\n“This was between two pages of paper. On the paper was written this.”\nSiona leaned over the table and read: “A strand of Ghanima’s hair with a starflower blossom which she once brought me.”\nLooking up at Nayla, Siona said: “Our God Emperor is revealed as a sentimentalist. That is a weakness | had not expected.”\n“Ghanima?” Nayla asked.\n“His sister! Remember your Oral History.”\n“Oh... oh, yes. The Prayer to Ghanima.”\n“Now, listen to this.” Siona took up another sheet of paper and read from it.\n“The sand beach as gray as a dead cheek, A green tideflow reflects cloud ripples;\n| stand on the dark wet edge.\nCold foam cleanses my toes.\n| smell driftwood smoke.”\nAgain, Siona looked up at Nayla. “This is identified as ‘Words | wrote when told of Ghani’s death.’ What do you think of that?”\n“He... he loved his sister.”\n“Yes! He is capable of love. Oh, yes! We have him now.”\nSometimes | indulge myself in safaris which no other being may take. | strike inward along the axis of my memories. Like a schoolchild reporting on a vacation trip, | take up my subject. Let it be... female intellectuals! | course backward into the ocean which is my ancestors. | am a great winged fish in the depths. The mouth of my awareness opens and | scoop them up! Sometimes . . . sometimes | hunt out specific persons recorded in our histories. What a private joy to relive the life of such a one while | mock the academic pretensions which supposedly formed a biography.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nMI oneo descended to the crypt with sad resignation. There was no escaping the duties required of him now. The God Emperor required a small passage of time to grieve the loss of another Duncan... but then life went on... and on...andon....\nThe lift slid silently downward with its superb Ixian dependability. Once, just once, the God Emperor had cried out to his majordomo: “Moneo! Sometimes | think you were made by the Ixians!”\nMoneo felt the lift stop. The door opened and he looked out across the crypt at the shadowy bulk on the Royal Cart. There was no indication that Leto had noticed the arrival. Moneo sighed and began the long walk through the echoing gloom. There was a body on the floor near the cart. No need for déja vu. This was merely familiar.\nOnce, in Moneo’s early days of service, Leto had said: “You don’t like this place, Moneo. | can see that.”\n“No, Lord.”\nWith just a little prodding of memory, Moneo could hear his own", "rieve the loss of another Duncan... but then life went on... and on...andon....\nThe lift slid silently downward with its superb Ixian dependability. Once, just once, the God Emperor had cried out to his majordomo: “Moneo! Sometimes | think you were made by the Ixians!”\nMoneo felt the lift stop. The door opened and he looked out across the crypt at the shadowy bulk on the Royal Cart. There was no indication that Leto had noticed the arrival. Moneo sighed and began the long walk through the echoing gloom. There was a body on the floor near the cart. No need for déja vu. This was merely familiar.\nOnce, in Moneo’s early days of service, Leto had said: “You don’t like this place, Moneo. | can see that.”\n“No, Lord.”\nWith just a little prodding of memory, Moneo could hear his own voice in that naive past. And the voice of the God Emperor responding:\n“You don’t think of a mausoleum as a comforting place, Moneo. | find it a source of infinite strength.”\nMoneo remembered that he had been anxious to get off this topic. “Yes, Lord.”\nLeto had persisted: “There are only a few of my ancestors here. The water of Muad’Dib is here. Ghani and Harg al-Ada are here, of course, but they’re not my ancestors. No, if there’s any true crypt of my ancestors, /am that crypt. This is mostly the Duncans and the products of my breeding program. You'll be here someday.”\nMoneo found that these memories had slowed his pace. He sighed and moved a bit faster. Leto could be violently impatient on occasion but there was still no sign from him. Moneo did not take this to mean that his approach went unobserved.\nLeto lay with his eyes closed and only his other senses to record Moneo’s progress across the crypt. Thoughts of Siona had been occupying Leto’s attention.\nSiona is my ardent enemy, he thought. / do not need Nayla’s words to confirm this. Siona is a woman of action. She lives on the surface of enormous energies which fill me with fantasies of delight. | cannot contemplate those living energies without a feeling of ecstasy. They are my reason for being, the justification for everything | have ever done... even for the corpse of this foolish Duncan in front of me now.\nLeto’s ears told him that Moneo had not yet crossed half the distance to the Royal Cart. The man moved slower and Slower, then picked up his pace.\nWhat a gift Moneo has given me in this daughter, Leto thought. Siona is fresh and precious. She is the new while | am a collection of the obsolete, a relic of the damned, of the lost and strayed. | am the waylaid pieces of history which sank out of sight in all of our pasts. Such an accumulation of riffraff has never before been imagined.\nLeto paraded the past within him then to let them observe what had happened in the crypt.\nThe minutiae are mine!\nSiona, though. . . Siona was like a clean slate upon which great things might yet be written.\n| guard that slate with infinite care. | am preparing it, Cleansing it.\nWhat did the Duncan mean when he called out her name?\nMoneo approached the cart diffidently yet consummately aware. Surely Leto did not sleep.\nLeto opened his eyes and looked down as Moneo came to a stop near the corpse. At this moment, Leto found the majordomo a delight to observe. Moneo wore a white Atreides uniform with no insignia, a subtle comment. His face, almost as well known as Leto’s, was all the insignia he needed. Moneo waited patiently. There was no change of expression on his flat, even features. His thick, sandy hair lay in a neat, equally divided part. Deep within his gray eyes there was that look of directness which went with knowledge of great personal power. It was a look which he modified only in the God Emperor’s presence, and sometimes not even there. Not once did he glance toward the body on the crypt’s floor.\nWhen Leto continued silent, Moneo cleared his throat, then: “I am saddened, Lord.”\nExquisite! Leto thought. He knows | feel true remorse about the Duncans. Moneo has seen their records and has seen enough of them dead. He knows that only nineteen Duncans died what people usually refer to as natural deaths.\n“He had an Ixian lasgun,” Leto said.\nMoneo’s gaze went directly to the gun on the floor of the crypt off to his left, demonstrating that he already had seen it. He returned his attention to Leto, sweeping a glance down the length of the great body.\n“You are injured, Lord?”\n“Inconsequential.”\n“But he hurt you.”\n“Those flippers are useless to me. They will be entirely gone within another two hundred years.”\n“I will dispose of the Duncan’s body personally, Lord,” Moneo said. “Is there...”\n“The piece of me he burned away is entirely ash. We will let it blow away. This is a fitting place for ashes.”\n“As my Lord says.”\n“Before you dispose of the body, disable the lasgun and keep it where | can present it to the Ixian ambassador. As for the Guildsman who warned us about it, present him personally with ten grams of spice. Oh—and our priestesses on Giedi Prime should be alerted to a hidden store of melange there, probably old Harkonnen contraband.”\n“What do you wish done with it when it’s found, Lord?”\n“Use a bit of it to pay the Tleilaxu for the new ghola. The rest of it can go into our stores here in the crypt.”\n“Lord.” Moneo acknowledged the orders with a nod, a gesture which was not quite a bow. His gaze met Leto’s.\nLeto smiled. He thought: We both know that Moneo will not leave without addressing directly the matter which most concerns us.\n“I have seen the report on Siona,” Moneo said.\nLeto’s smile widened. Moneo was such a pleasure in these moments. His words conveyed many things which did not require open discussion between them. His words and actions were in precise alignment, carried on the mutual awareness that he, of course, spied on everything. Now, there was a natural concern for his daughter, but he wished it understood that his concern for the God Emperor remained paramount. From his own traverse through a similar evolution, Moneo knew with precision the delicate nature of Siona’s present fortunes.\n“Have | not created her, Moneo?” Leto asked. “Have | not controlled the conditions of her ancestry and her\nupbringing?”\n“She is my only daughter, my only child, Lord.”\n“In a way, she reminds me of Harq al-Ada,” Leto said. “There doesn’t appear to be much of Ghani in her, although that has to be there. Perhaps she harks back to our ancestors in the Sisterhood’s breeding program.”\n“Why do you say that, Lord?”\nLeto reflected. Was there need for Moneo to know this peculiar thing about his daughter? Siona could fade from the prescient view at times. The Golden Path remained, but Siona faded. Yet... she was not prescient. She was a unique phenomenon... and if she survived. . . Leto decided he would not cloud Moneo’s efficiency with unnecessary information.\n“Remember your own past,” Leto said.\n“Indeed, Lord! And she has such a potential, so much more than | ever had. But that makes her dangerous, too.”\n“And she will not listen to you,” Leto said.\n“No, but | have an agent in her rebellion.”\nThat will be Topri, Leto thought.\nIt required no prescience to know that Moneo would have an agent in place. Ever since the death of Siona’s mother, Leto had known with increasing sureness the course of Moneo’s actions. Nayla’s suspicions pinpointed Topri. And now, Moneo paraded his fears and actions, offering them as the price of his daughter’s continued safety.\nHow unfortunate he fathered only the one child on that mother.\n“Recall how | treated you in similar circumstances,” Leto said. “You know the demands of the Golden Path as well as | do.”\n“But | was young and foolish, Lord.”\n“Young and brash, never foolish.”\nMoneo managed a tight smile at this compliment, his thoughts leaning more and more toward the belief that he now understood Leto’s intentions. The dangers, though!\nFeeding his belief, Leto said: “You know how much | enjoy Surprises.”\nThat is true, Leto thought. Moneo does know it. But even while Siona surprises me, she reminds me of what I fear most—the sameness and boredom which could break the Golden Path. Look at how boredom put me temporarily in the Duncan’s power! Siona is the contrast by which | know my deepest fears. Moneo’s concern for me is well grounded.\n“My agent will continue to watch her new companions, Lord,” Moneo said. “I do not like them.”\n“Her companions? | myself had such companions once long ago.”\n“Rebellious, Lord? You?” Moneo was genuinely surprised.\n“Have | not proved a friend of rebellion?”\n“But Lord...”\n“The aberrations of our past are more numerous than you may think!”\n“Yes, Lord.” Moneo was abashed, yet still curious. And he knew that the God Emperor sometimes waxed loquacious after the death of a Duncan. “You must have seen many rebellions, Lord.”\nInvoluntarily, Leto’s thoughts sank into the memories aroused by these words.\n“Ahhh, Moneo,” he muttered. “My travels in the ancestral mazes have memorized uncounted places and events which | never desire to see repeated.”\n“I can imagine your inward travels, Lord.”\n“No, you cannot. | have seen peoples and planets in such numbers that they lose meaning even in imagination. Ohhh, the landscapes I have passed. The calligraphy of alien roads glimpsed from space and imprinted upon my innermost sight. The eroded sculpture of canyons and cliffs and galaxies has imprinted upon me the certain knowledge that |I am a mote.”\n“Not you, Lord. Certainly not you.”\n“Less than a mote! | have seen people and their fruitless societies in such repetitive posturings that their nonsense fills me with boredom, do you hear?”\n“I did not mean to anger my Lord.” Moneo spoke meekly.\n“You don’t anger me. Sometimes you irritate me, that is the extent of it. You cannot imagine what | have seen— caliphs and mjeeds, rakahs, rajas and bashars, kings and emperors, primitos and presidents—I’ve seen them all. Feudal chieftains, every one. Every one a little pharaoh.”\n“Forgive my presumption, Lord.”\n“Damn the Romans!” Leto cried.\nHe spoke it inwardly to his ancestors: “Damn the Romans!”\nTheir laughter drove him from the inward arena.\n“| don’t understand, Lord,” Moneo ventured.\n“That’s true. You don’t understand. The Romans broadcast the pharaonic disease like grain farmers scattering the seeds of next season’s harvest—Caesars, kaisers, tsars, imperators, caseris ...palatos ... damned pharaohs!”\n“My knowledge does not encompass all of those", "ly.\n“You don’t anger me.

Pray that this is so.”\n“Whatever my Lord commands.”\nLeto stared down at the man. “We are myth-killers, you and I, Moneo. That’s the dream we share. | assure you from a God’s Olympian perch that government is a shared myth. When the myth dies, the government dies.”\n“Thus you have taught me, Lord.”\n“That man-machine, the Army, created our present dream, my friend.”\nMoneo cleared his throat.\nLeto recognized the small signs of the majordomo’s impatience.\nMoneo understands about armies. He knows it was a fool’s dream that armies were the basic instrument of\ngovernance.\nAs Leto continued silent, Moneo crossed to the lasgun and retrieved it from the crypt’s cold floor. He began disabling it.\nLeto watched him, thinking how this tiny scene encapsulated the essence of the Army myth. The Army fostered technology because the power of machines appeared so obvious to the shortsighted.\nThat lasgun is no more than a machine. But all machines fail or are superceded. Still, the Army worships at the shrine of such things—both fascinated and fearful. Look at how people fear the Ixians! In its guts, the Army knows it is the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. It unleashes technology and never again can the magic be stuffed back into the bottle.\n| teach them another magic.\nLeto spoke to the hordes within then:\n“You see? Moneo has disabled the deadly instrument. A connection broken here, a small capsule crushed there.”\nLeto sniffed. He smelled the esters of a preservative oil riding on the stink of Moneo’s perspiration.\nStill speaking inwardly, Leto said: “But the genie is not dead. Technology breeds anarchy. It distributes these tools at random. And with them goes the provocation for violence. The ability to make and use savage destroyers falls inevitably into the hands of smaller and smaller groups until at last the group is a single individual.”\nMoneo returned to a point below Leto, holding the disabled lasgun casually in his right hand. “There is talk on Parella and the planets of Dan about another jihad against such things as this.”\nMoneo lifted the lasgun and smiled, signaling that he knew the paradox in such empty dreams.\nLeto closed his eyes. The hordes within wanted to argue, but he shut them off, thinking: /ihads create armies. The Butlerian Jihad tried to rid our universe of machines which simulate the mind of man. The Butlerians left armies in their wake and the Ixians still make questionable devices... for\nwhich I thank them. What is anathema? The motivation to ravage, no matter the instruments.\n“It happened,” he muttered.\n“Lord?”\nLeto opened his eyes. “I will go to my tower,” he said. “l must have more time to mourn my Duncan.”\n“The new one is already on his way here,” Moneo said.\nYou, the first person to encounter my chronicles for at least four thousand years, beware. Do not feel honored by your primacy in reading the revelations of my Ixian storehouse. You will find much pain in it. Other than the few glimpses required to assure me that the Golden Path continued, | never wanted to peer beyond those four millennia. Therefore, | am not sure what the events in my journals may signify to your times. | only know that my journals have suffered oblivion and that the events which I recount have undoubtedly been submitted to historical distortion for eons. | assure you that the ability to view our futures can become a bore. Even to be thought of as a god, as | certainly was, can become ultimately boring. It has occurred to me more than once that holy boredom is good and sufficient reason for the invention of free will.\n—INSCRIPTION ON THE STOREHOUSE AT DAR-ES-BALAT\nyee Duncan Idaho.\nThat was about all he wanted to know for sure. He did not like the Tleilaxu explanations, their stories. But then the Tleilaxu had always been feared. Disbelieved and feared.\nThey had brought him down to the planet on a small Guild shuttle, arriving at the dusk line with a green glimmer of sun corona along the horizon as they dipped into the shadow. The spaceport had not looked at all like anything he remembered. It was larger and with a ring of strange buildings.\n“Are you sure this is Dune?” he had asked.\n“Arrakis,” his Tleilaxu escort had corrected him.\nThey had sped him in a sealed groundcar to this building somewhere within a city they called Onn, giving the “n” sound a strange rising nasal inflection. The room in which they left him was about three meters square, a cube really. There was no sign of glowglobes, but the place was filled with warm yellow light.\nlam a ghola, he told himself.\nThat had been a shock, but he had to believe it. To find himself living when he knew he had died, that was proof enough. The Tleilaxu had taken cells from his dead flesh and they had grown a bud in one of their axlotl tanks. That bud had become this body in a process which had made him feel at first an alien in his own flesh.\nHe looked down at the body. It was clothed in dark brown trousers and jacket of a coarse weave which irritated his Skin. Sandals protected his feet. Except for the body, that was all they had given him, a parsimony which said something about the real Tleilaxu character.\nThere was no furniture in the room. They had let him in through a single door which had no handle on the inside. He looked up at the ceiling and around at the walls, at the door. Despite the featureless character of the place, he felt that he was being watched.\n“Women of the Imperial Guard will come for you,” they had said. Then they had gone away, smiling slyly among themselves.\nWomen of the Imperial Guard?\nThe Tleilaxu escort had taken sadistic delight in exposing their shape-changing abilities. He had not known from one minute to the next what new form the plastic flow of their flesh would present.\nDamned Face Dancers!\nThey had known all about him, of course, had known how much the Shape Changers disgusted him.\nWhat could he trust if it came from Face Dancers? Very little. Could anything they said be believed?\nMy name. | know my name.\nAnd he had his memories. They had shocked the identity back into him. Gholas were supposed to be incapable of recovering the original identity. But the Tleilaxu had done it and he was forced to believe because he understood how it had been done.\nIn the beginning, he knew, there had been the fully formed ghola, adult flesh without name or memories—a palimpsest upon which the Tleilaxu could write almost anything they wished.\n“You are Ghola,” they had said. That had been his only name for a long time. Ghola had been taken like a malleable infant and conditioned to kill a particular man—a man so like the original Paul Muad’Dib he had served and adored that Idaho now suspected it might have been another ghola. But if that were true, where had they obtained the original cells?\nSomething in the Idaho cells had rebelled at killing an Atreides. He had found himself standing with a knife in one hand, the bound form of the pseudo-Paul staring up at him in angry terror.\nMemories had gushered into his awareness. He remembered Ghola and he remembered Duncan Idaho.\nlam Duncan Idaho, swordmaster of the Atreides.\nHe clung to this memory as he stood in the yellow room.\n| died defending Paul and his mother in a cave-sietch beneath the sands of Dune. I have been returned to that planet, but Dune is no more. Now it is only Arrakis.\nHe had read the truncated history which the Tleilaxu provided, but he did not believe it. More than thirty-five hundred years? Who could believe his flesh existed after such a time? Except... with the Tleilaxu it was possible. He had to believe his own senses.\n“There have been many of you,” his instructors had said.\n“How many?”\n“The Lord Leto will provide that information.”\nThe Lord Leto?\nThe Tleilaxu history said this Lord Leto was Leto Il, grandson of the Leto whom Idaho had served with fanatical devotion. But this second Leto (so the history said) had become something . . . something so strange that Idaho despaired of understanding the transformation.\nHow could a human slowly turn into a sandworm? How could any thinking creature live more than three thousand years? Not even the wildest projections of geriatric spice allowed such a lifespan.\nLeto II, the God Emperor?\nThe Tleilaxu history was not to be believed!\nIdaho remembered a strange child—twins, really: Leto and Ghanima, Paul’s children, the children of Chani, who had died delivering them. The Tleilaxu history said Ghanima had died after a relatively normal life, but the God Emperor Leto lived on and on andon....\n“He is a tyrant,” Idaho’s instructors had said. “He has ordered us to produce you from our axlotl tanks and to send you into his service. We do not know what has happened to your predecessor.”\nAnd here | am.\nOnce more, Idaho let his gaze wander around the featureless walls and ceiling.\nThe faint sound of voices intruded upon his awareness. He looked at the door. The voices were muted, but at least one of them sounded female.\nWomen of the Imperial Guard?\nThe door swung inward on noiseless hinges. Two women entered. The first thing to catch his attention was the fact that one of the women wore a mask, a cibus hood of shapeless, light-drinking black. She would see him clearly through the hood, he knew, but her features would never reveal themselves, not even to the most subtle instruments of penetration. The hood said that the Ixians or their inheritors were still at work in the Imperium. Both women wore one-piece uniforms of rich blue with the Atreides hawk in red braid at the left breast.\nIdaho studied them as they closed the door and faced him.\nThe masked woman had a blocky, powerful body. She moved with the deceptive care of a professional muscle\nfanatic. The other woman was graceful and slender with almond eyes in sharp, high-boned features. Idaho had the feeling that he had seen her somewhere, but he could not fix the memory. Both women carried needle knives in hip sheaths. Something about their movements told Idaho these women would be extremely competent with such weapons.\nThe slender one"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_62b2d586c4657e156fce9ae52e8a1d14ee0546889d44377d770c3e2a04bc7b6b_v2"}
