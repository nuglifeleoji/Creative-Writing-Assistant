Do you wish a sign?”\nHis nostrils flared in the moonlight. “We cannot tarry for the rites,” he whispered.\nJessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called “Sietch Tabr” on the chart and beside it the notation: “Stilgar.”\n“Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr,” she said.\nThe revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: /f only he knew the tricks we use! She must’ve been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva. These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.\nStilgar shifted uneasily. “We must go now.”\nShe nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.\nHe looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul crouched. “You there, lad: you may come down now.” He returned his attention to Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: “Your son made an incredible amount of noise climbing. He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but he’s young.”\n“No doubt we have much to teach each other,” Jessica said. “Meanwhile, you’d best see to your companion out there. My noisy son was a bit rough in disarming him.”\nStilgar whirled, his hood flapping. “Where?”\n“Beyond those bushes.” She pointed.\nStilgar touched two of his men. “See to it.” He glanced at his companions, identifying them. “Jamis is missing.” He turned to Jessica. “Even your cub knows the weirding way.”\n“And you'll notice that my son hasn’t stirred from up there as you ordered,” Jessica said.\nThe two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned his attention to Jessica. “The son will take only your orders, eh? Good. He knows discipline.”\n“Paul, you may come down now,” Jessica said.\nPaul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another figure arose from the rocks to face him.\nIn the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul Saw a small figure in Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.\n“lam Chani, daughter of Liet.”\nThe voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.\n“I would not have permitted you to harm my companions,” she said.\nPaul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon’s path and he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that face, the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to stillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this face- from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam: “I will meet her.”\nAnd here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.\n“You were as noisy as Shai-hulud in a rage,” she said. “And you took the most difficult way up here. Follow me; l'Il show you an easier way down.”\nHe scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a tumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks. Paul felt hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.\nThat girl! She was like a touch of destiny. He felt caught up on a wave, in tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits.\nThey stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor.\nJessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: “This will be a good exchange of teachings. | hope you and your people feel no anger at our violence. It seemed...necessary. You were about to... make a mistake.”\n“To save one from a mistake Is a gift of paradise,” Stilgar said. He touched his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon from Paul’s waist with the other, tossed it to a companion. “You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when you’ve earned it.”\nPaul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother’s teaching: “Beginnings are such delicate times.”\n“My son has what weapons he needs,” Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar, forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.\nStilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued— Jamis. The man stood at one side, head lowered, breathing heavily. “You are a difficult woman,” Stilgar said. He held out his left hand to a companion, Snapped his fingers. “Kushti bakka te.”\nMore Chakobsa, Jessica thought.\nThe companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar’s hand. Stilgar ran them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica’s neck beneath her hood, fitted the other around Paul’s neck in the same way.\n“Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka,” he said. “If we become separated, you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar’s sietch. We will talk of weapons another time.”\nHe moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul’s Fremkit pack to one of his men to Carry.\nBakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka—the weeper. She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. Why should weeping unite them? she asked herself.\nStilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: “Chani, take the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of trouble.”\nChani touched Paul’s arm. “Come along, child- man.”\nPaul hid the anger in his voice, said: “My name is Paul. It were well you—”\n“We'll give you a name, manling,” Stilgar said, “in the time of the mihna, at the test of aql.”\nThe test of reason, Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul’s ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and she barked, “My son’s been tested with the gom jabbar!”\nIn the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of them.\n“There’s much we don’t know of each other,” Stilgar said. “But we tarry overlong. Day-sun mustn’t find us in the open.” He crossed to the man Paul had struck down, said, “Jamis, can you travel?”\nA grunt answered him. “Surprised me, he did. \"Twas an accident. | can travel.”\n“No accident,” Stilgar said. “lIl hold you responsible with Chani for the lad’s safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance.”\nJessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with Stilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death in it. And Stilgar had seen fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.\nStilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out. “Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no trace. Extra care—we have two with us who’ve not been trained.” He turned, hand upheld and aimed across the basin. “In squad line with flankers—move out. We must be at Cave of the Ridges before dawn.”\nJessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty Fremen—she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought: They travel as a military company—even the girl, Chani.\nPaul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black feeling at being caught by the girl. In his mind now was the memory called up by his mother’s barked reminder: “My son’s been tested with the gom jabbar!” He found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.\n“Watch where you go,” Chani hissed. “Do not brush against a bush lest you leave a thread to show our passage.”\nPaul swallowed, nodded.\nJessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and Paul’s, marveling at the way the Fremen moved. They were forty people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the place—\nghostly feluccas, their robes flitting through the Shadows. Their destination was Sietch Tabr—Stilgar’s sietch.\nShe turned the word over in her mind: sietch. It was a Chakobsa word, unchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries. Sietch: a meeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of the word and the language were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their encounter.\n“We move well,” Stilgar said. “With Shai-hulud’s favor, we'll reach Cave of the Ridges before dawn.”\nJessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will... and, she admitted it: by the force of elation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed here about the Fremen culture.\nAll of them, she thought, an entire culture trained to military order. What a priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!\nThe Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called “spannungsbogen”—which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.\n—FROM “THE WISDOM OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhey approached Cave of the Ridges at\ndawnbreak, moving through a split in the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it. Jessica Saw Stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began their scrambling climb up the cliff.\nPaul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray-blue sky.\nChani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: “Quickly. It is already light.”\n“The men who climbed above us, where are they going?” Paul whispered.\n“The first daywatch,” she said. “Hurry now!”\nA guard left outside, Paul thought. Wise. But it would’ve been wiser still for us to approach this place in separate bands. Less chance of losing the whole troop. He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and he remembered his father’s fear that the Atreides might become a guerrilla house.\n“Faster,” Chani whispered.\nPaul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought of the words of the sirat from Yueh’s tiny O.C. Bible.\n“Paradise on my right, Hell on my left, and the Angel of Death behind.” He rolled the quotation in his mind.\nThey rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.\n“Quickly!” he hissed. “We're like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us here.”\nPaul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin gray light from somewhere ahead.\n“You can stand up,” she said.\nHe straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a man’s handreach. The troop spread out through shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>A meeting place in time of danger for the Fremen, mentioned on a chart by Kynes as an emergency escape route destination\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Leader of the Fremen group, responsible for the safety of Jessica and Paul, and a key figure in their journey to Sietch Tabr\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Mother of Paul, a Bene Gesserit trained in the ways of the Missionaria Protectiva, skilled in manipulation and survival\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Son of Jessica, tested with the gom jabbar, showing potential for leadership and prescience, currently under the protection of the Fremen\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Daughter of Liet, a Fremen girl assigned to guide and protect Paul, showing familiarity with Fremen ways and the terrain\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMIS<|>PERSON<|>A Fremen warrior who was subdued by Paul, now responsible alongside Chani for Paul's safety\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with abilities in manipulation and prophecy, to which Jessica belongs\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A branch of the Bene Gesserit responsible for planting myths and prophecies among cultures to ensure the sisterhood's survival and influence\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A desert-dwelling people with a highly disciplined and militarized culture, skilled in survival on Arrakis\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAVE OF THE RIDGES<|>GEO<|>A temporary shelter for the Fremen, reached after a night's journey, used as a hiding place during daylight\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, trained in their ways and teachings<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>Jessica is aware of the Missionaria Protectiva's work, which has prepared the Fremen to believe in her and Paul<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>JESSICA<|>Paul is the son of Jessica, and they share a close bond and mutual protection<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CHANI<|>Chani is assigned to guide and protect Paul, showing a budding relationship between them<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>STILGAR<|>Stilgar is responsible for Paul's safety and has taken him under his protection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>JAMIS<|>Jamis was subdued by Paul and is now responsible for his safety, creating a tense relationship<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>FREMEN<|>Stilgar is a leader of a Fremen group, embodying their discipline and culture<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANI<|>FREMEN<|>Chani is a Fremen girl, deeply integrated into their culture and ways<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMIS<|>FREMEN<|>Jamis is a Fremen warrior, part of Stilgar's group<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>FREMEN<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen meeting place and refuge<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAVE OF THE RIDGES<|>FREMEN<|>Cave of the Ridges is used by the Fremen as a temporary shelter<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
