Many powerful forces do the same thing. You can count religions among such forces.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\na (pes Lord has commanded me to tell you that your daughter lives.”\nNayla delivered the message to Moneo in a singsong voice, looking down across the workroom table at his figure seated there amidst a chaos of notes and papers and communications instruments.\nMoneo pressed his palms together firmly and looked down at the elongated shadow drawn on his table by late afternoon sunlight across the jeweled tree of his paperweight.\nWithout looking up at Nayla’s stocky figure standing at proper attention in front of him, he asked: “Both of them have returned to the Citadel?”\n“Yes.”\nMoneo looked out the window to his left, not really seeing the flinty borderline of darkness hanging on the Sareer’s horizon nor the greedy wind collecting sand grains from every dunetop.\n“That matter which we discussed earlier?” he asked.\n“It has been arranged.”\n“Very well.” He waved to dismiss her, but Nayla remained standing in front of him. Surprised, Moneo actually focused on her for the first time since she had entered.\n“Is it required that | personally attend this”—she swallowed—“wedding?”\n“The Lord Leto has commanded it. You will be the only one there armed with a lasgun. It is an honor.”\nShe remained in position, her gaze fixed somewhere over Moneo’s head.\n“Yes?” he prompted.\nNayla’s great lantern jaw worked convulsively, then: “He is God and | am mortal.” She turned on one heel and left the workroom.\nMoneo wondered vaguely what was bothering that hulking Fish Speaker, but his thoughts turned like a compass arrow to Siona.\nShe has survived as I did. Siona now had an inner sense which told her that the Golden Path remained unbroken. As / have. He found no sense of sharing in this, nothing to make him feel closer to his daughter. It was a burden and it would inevitably curb her rebellious nature. No Atreides could go against the Golden Path. Leto had seen to that!\nMoneo remembered his own rebel days. Every night a new bed and the constant urge to run. The cobwebs of his past clung to his mind, sticking there no matter how hard he tried to shake away troublesome memories.\nSiona has been caged. As | was caged. As poor Leto was caged.\nThe tolling of the nightfall bell intruded on his thoughts and activated his workroom’s lights. He looked down at the work still undone in preparation for the God Emperor’s wedding to Hwi Noree. So much work! Presently, he pressed a call-button and asked the Fish Speaker acolyte who appeared at the summons to bring him a tumbler of water and then call Duncan Idaho to the workroom.\nShe returned quickly with the water and placed the tumbler near his left hand on the table. He noted the long fingers, a lute-player’s fingers, but did not look up at her face.\n“I have sent someone for Idaho,” she said.\nHe nodded and went on with his work. He heard her leave and only then did he look up to drink the water.\nSome live lives like summer moths, he thought. But / have burdens without end.\nThe water tasted flat. It weighed down his senses, making his body feel torpid. He looked out at the sunset colors on the Sareer as they shaded away into darkness, thinking that he should recognize beauty in that familiar sense, but all he could think was that the light changed in its own patterns. /t is not moved by me at all.\nWith the full darkness, the light level of his workroom increased automatically, bringing a clarity of thought with it. He felt himself quite prepared for Idaho. This one had to be taught the necessities, and quickly.\nMoneo’s door opened, the acolyte again. “Will you eat now?”\n“Later.” He raised a hand as she started to leave. “I would like the door left open.”\nShe frowned.\n“You may practice your music,” he said. “I want to listen.”\nShe had a smooth, round, almost childlike face which became radiant when she smiled. The smile still on her lips, she turned away.\nPresently, he heard the sounds of a biwa lute in the outer office. Yes, that young acolyte had a talent. The bass strings were like rain drumming on a rooftop, a whisper of middle strings underneath. Perhaps she could move up to the baliset someday. He recognized the song: a deeply humming memory of autumn wind from some faraway planet where they had never known a desert. Sad music, pitiful music, yet marvellous.\nIt is the cry of the caged, he thought. The memory of freedom. This thought struck him as odd. Was it always the case that freedom required rebellion?\nThe lute fell silent. There came the sound of low voices. Idaho entered the workroom. Moneo watched him enter. A trick of light gave Idaho a face like a grimacing mask with pitted eyes. Without invitation, he sat down across from Moneo and the trickery was gone. Just another Duncan. He had changed into a plain black uniform without insignia.\n“I have been asking myself a peculiar question,” Idaho said. “I’m glad you summoned me. | want to ask this question of you. What is it, Moneo, that my predecessor did not learn?”\nStiff with surprise, Moneo sat up straight. What an un- Duncan question! Could there be a peculiar Tleilaxu difference in this one after all?\n“What prompts this question?” Moneo asked.\n“I’ve been thinking like a Fremen.”\n“You weren't a Fremen.”\n“Closer to it than you think. Stilgar the Naib once said | was probably born Fremen without knowing it until | came to Dune.”\n“What happens when you think like a Fremen?”\n“You remember that you should never be in company that you wouldn’t want to die with.”\nMoneo put his hands palms down on the surface of his table. A wolfish smile came over Idaho’s face.\n“Then what are you doing here?” Moneo asked.\n“I suspect that you may be good company, Moneo. And | ask myself why Leto would choose you as his closest companion.”\n“I passed the test.”\n“The same one your daughter passed?”\nSo he has heard they are back. It meant some of the Fish\nSpeakers were reporting things to him... unless the God Emperor had summoned the Duncan. ... No, I would have heard.\n“The tests are never identical,” Moneo said. “I was made to go alone into a cavern maze with nothing but a bag of\nfood and a vial of spice-essence.”\n“Which did you choose?”\n“What? Oh... if you are tested, you will learn.”\n“There’s a Leto | don’t know,” Idaho said.\n“Have I not told you this?”\n“And there’s a Leto you don’t know,” Idaho said.\n“Because he’s the loneliest person this universe has ever seen,” Moneo said.\n“Don’t play mood games trying to arouse my sympathy,” Idaho said.\n“Mood games, yes. That’s very good,” Moneo nodded. “The God Emperor’s moods are like a river—smooth where nothing obstructs him, foaming and violent at the least suggestion of a barrier. He is not to be obstructed.”\nIdaho looked around at the brightly lighted workroom, turned his gaze to the outside darkness and thought about the tamed course of the /daho River somewhere out there. Bringing his attention back to Moneo, he asked: “What do you know of rivers?”\n“In my youth, I traveled for him. | have even trusted my life to a floating shell of a vessel on a river and then ona sea whose shores were lost in the crossing.”\nAs he spoke, Moneo felt that he had brushed against a clue to some deep truth in the Lord Leto. The sensation dropped Moneo into reverie, thinking of that far planet where he had crossed a sea from one shore to another. There had been a storm on the first evening of that passage and, somewhere deep within the ship, an irritating non- directional “sug-sug-sug-sug-sug” of laboring engines. He had stood on deck with the captain. His mind had kept focusing on the engine sound, retreating and coming back to it like the oversurging of the watery green-black mountains which passed and came, repeating and repeating. Each down crash of the keel opened the sea’s flesh like a fist smashing. It was insane motion, a sodden Shaking, up... up, down! His lungs had ached with\nrepressed fear. The lunging of the ship and the sea trying to put them down—wild explosions of solid water, hour after hour, white blisters of water spilling off the decks, then another sea and another...\nAll of this was a clue to the God Emperor.\nHe is both the storm and the ship.\nMoneo focused on Idaho seated across the table from him in the workroom’s cold light. Not a tremor in the man, but a hungering was there.\n“So you will not help me learn what the other Duncan Idahos did not learn,” Idaho said.\n“But | will help you.”\n“Then what have | always failed to learn?”\n“How to trust.”\nIdaho pushed himself back from the table and glared at Moneo. When Idaho’s voice came, it was harsh and rasping: “I'd say | trusted too much.”\nMoneo was implacable. “But how do you trust?”\n“What do you mean?”\nMoneo put his hands in his lap. “You choose male companions for their ability to fight and die on the side of right as you see it. You choose females who can complement this masculine view of yourself. You allow for no differences which can come from good will.”\nSomething moved in the doorway to Moneo’s workroom. He looked up in time to see Siona enter. She stopped, one hand on her hip.\n“Well, father, up to your old tricks, | see.”\nIdaho jerked around to stare at the speaker.\nMoneo studied her, looking for signs of the change. She had bathed and put on a fresh uniform, the black and gold of Fish Speaker command, but her face and hands still betrayed the evidence of her desert ordeal. She had lost weight and her cheekbones stood out. Unguent did little to conceal cracks in her lips. Veins stood out on her hands. Her\neyes looked ancient and her expression was that of someone who had tasted bitter dregs.\n“I’ve been listening to you two,” she said. She dropped her hand from her hip and moved farther into the room. “How dare you speak of good will, father?”\nIdaho had noted the uniform. He pursed his lips in thought. Fish Speaker Command? Siona?\n“| understand your bitterness,” Moneo said. “I had similar feelings once.”\n“Did you really?” She came closer, stopping just beside Idaho, who continued to regard her with a look of speculation.\n“lam filled with joy to see you alive,” Moneo said.\n“How gratifying for you to see me safely into the God Emperor’s Service,” she said. “You waited\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a key figure in the God Emperor's court, involved in preparations for the wedding and managing communications and tasks for the God Emperor.
