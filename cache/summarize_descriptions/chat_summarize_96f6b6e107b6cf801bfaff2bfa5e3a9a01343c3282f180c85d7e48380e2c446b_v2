The Archives is not merely a passive storage facility but an active organization responsible for preserving historical records and ensuring their accessibility for the order's needs.  \n\nWhile its primary function is record-keeping, the Archives has also been involved in conflicts, notably clashing with the **Bashar** over the handling of sensitive information. This underscores its importance as both a guardian of knowledge and a key player in Bene Gesserit politics. Bellonda's oversight further emphasizes its operational significance, as she works within the Archives to maintain and utilize its vast resources.  \n\nIn summary, the **ARCHIVES** is a vital institution within the Bene Gesserit, combining the roles of a knowledge repository, an administrative body, and a strategic asset.
