They travel jointly, with Siona bringing Idaho to Goygoa to confront his past, suggesting a deliberate effort to challenge or reconcile with his history. Throughout their interactions, Idaho questions Siona’s motives and beliefs, reflecting a dynamic of skepticism and intrigue. Despite this, the two engage in deep conversations and work collaboratively, indicating a mutual respect or shared purpose.  \n\nTheir bond is further defined by Siona’s enigmatic behavior and Idaho’s contemplations on Fremen traditions, creating a push-and-pull dynamic between them. This tension underscores their differing perspectives, yet they remain united during critical moments, such as standing together during Leto II’s final moments. Their shared experiences—whether confronting the past, debating ideologies, or witnessing profound events—highlight a relationship that is both contentious and deeply interconnected.  \n\nIn summary, Siona and Idaho’s partnership is multifaceted, blending cooperation with underlying friction.
