She quickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon.\nThe figure above was not one of her own escort. Otheym? she wondered, marking a familiarity of movement and manner. She came up to him, recognized in the growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing out on the desert for only a moment.\n“Hurry,” he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden cave. “It will be light soon,” he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her. “The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region. We dare not chance discovery now.”\nThey emerged into the narrow side-passage entrance to the Cave of Birds. Glowglobes came alight. Otheym pressed past her, said: “Follow me. Quickly, now.”\nThey sped down the passage, through another valve door, another passage and through hangings into what had been the Sayyadina’s alcove in the days when this was an overday rest cave. Rugs and cushions now covered the floor. Woven hangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls. A low field desk at one side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice origin.\nThe Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance. She looked up with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.\nOtheym pressed palms together, said: “I have brought Chani.” He bowed, retreated through the hangings.\nAnd Jessica thought: How do I tell Chani?\n“How is my grandson?” Jessica asked.\nSo it’s to be the ritual greeting, Chani thought, and her fears returned. Where is Muad’Dib? Why isn’t he here to greet me?\n“He is healthy and happy, my mother,” Chani said. “I left him with Alia in the care of Harah.”\nMy mother, Jessica thought. Yes, she has the right to call me that in the formal greeting. She has given me a grandson.\n“| hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch,” Jessica said.\n“It is lovely cloth,” Chani said.\n“Does Alia send a message?”\n“No message. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are beginning to accept the miracle of her status.”\nWhy does she drag this out so? Chani wondered. Something was so urgent that they sent a ‘thopter for me. Now, we drag through the formalities!\n“We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto,” Jessica said.\n“Whatever you wish, my mother,” Chani said. She lowered her gaze. “Is there news of battles?” She held her face expressionless that Jessica might not see the betrayal—that this was a question about Paul-Muad’Dib.\n“New victories,” Jessica said. “Rabban has sent cautious overtures about a truce. His messengers have been returned without their water. Rabban has even lightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages. But he is too late. The people know he does it out of fear of us.”\n“Thus it goes as Muad’Dib said,” Chani said. She Stared at Jessica, trying to keep her fears to herself. / have spoken his name, but she has not responded. One cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face...but she is too frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?\n“I wish we were in the south,” Jessica said. “The oases were so beautiful when we left. Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?”\n“The land is beautiful, true,” Chani said. “But there is much grief in it.”\n“Grief is the price of victory,” Jessica said.\nIs she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herself. She said: “There are so many women without men.\nThere was jealousy when it was learned that I’d been Summoned north.”\n“I Summoned you,” Jessica said.\nChani felt her heart hammering. She wanted to clap her hands to her ears, fearful of what they might hear. Still, she kept her voice even: “The message was signed Muad'’Dib.”\n“I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants,” Jessica said. “It was a subterfuge of necessity.” And Jessica thought: This is a brave woman, my Paul’s. She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her. Yes. She may be the one we need now.\nOnly the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chani’s voice as she said: “Now you may say the thing that must be said.”\n“You were needed here to help me revive Paul,” Jessica said. And she thought: There! I said it in the precisely correct way. Revive. Thus she knows Paul ts alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.\nChani took only a moment to calm herself, then: “What is it | may do?” She wanted to leap at Jessica, Shake her and scream: “Take me to him!” But she waited silently for the answer.\n“I suspect,” Jessica said, “that the Harkonnens have managed to send an agent among us to poison Paul. It’s the only explanation that seems to fit. A most unusual poison. I’ve examined his blood in the most subtle ways without detecting it.”\nChani thrust herself forward onto her knees. “Poison? Is he in pain? Could l....”\n“He is unconscious,” Jessica said. “The processes of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. | shudder to think what could have happened had | not been the one to discover him. He appears dead to the untrained eye.”\n“You have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me,” Chani said. “I know you, Reverend Mother. What is it you think | may do that you cannot do?”\nShe is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive, Jessica thought. She’d have made a fine Bene Gesserit.\n“Chani,” Jessica said, “you may find this difficult to believe, but | do not know precisely why | sent for you. It was an instinct...a basic intuition. The thought came unbidden: ‘Send for Chani.’”\nFor the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica’s expression, the unveiled pain modifying the inward stare.\n“I’ve done all I know to do,” Jessica said. “That all...it is so far beyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty imagining it. Yet...| failed.”\n“The old companion, Halleck,” Chani asked, “is it possible he’s a traitor?”\n“Not Gurney,” Jessica said.\nThe two words carried an entire conversation, and Chani saw the searching, the tests...the memories of old failures that went into this flat denial.\nChani rocked back onto her feet, stood up, smoothed her desert-stained robe. “Take me to him,” she said.\nJessica arose, turned through hangings on the left wall.\nChani followed, found herself in what had been a storeroom, its rock walls concealed now beneath heavy draperies. Paul lay on a field pad against the far wall. A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face. A black robe covered him to the chest, leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides. He appeared to be unclothed under the robe. The skin exposed looked waxen, rigid. There was no visible movement to him.\nChani suppressed the desire to dash forward, throw herself across him. She found her thoughts, instead, going to her son—Leto. And she realized in this instant that Jessica once had faced such a moment—her man threatened by death, forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young son. The realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani reached out and clasped Jessica’s hand. The answering grip was painful in its intensity.\n“He lives,” Jessica said. “I assure you he lives. But the thread of his life is so thin it could easily escape detection. There are some among the leaders already muttering that the mother speaks and not the Reverend Mother, that my son is truly dead and | do not want to give up his water to the tribe.”\n“How long has he been this way?” Chani asked. She disengaged her hand from Jessica’s, moved farther into the room.\n“Three weeks,” Jessica said. “I spent almost a week trying to revive him. There were meetings,\narguments...investigations. Then | sent for you. The Fedaykin obey my orders, else | might not have been able to delay the....” She wet her lips with her tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul.\nChani stood over him now, looking down on the soft beard of youth that framed his face, tracing with her eyes the high browline, the strong nose, the shuttered eyes—the features so peaceful in this rigid repose.\n“How does he take nourishment?” Chani asked.\n“The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food,” Jessica said.\n“How many know of what has happened?” Chani asked.\n“Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of course, whoever administered the poison.”\n“There is no clue to the poisoner?”\n“And it’s not for want of investigating,” Jessica said.\n“What do the Fedaykin say?” Chani asked.\n“They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers before the final battles. This is a thought I’ve cultivated.”\nChani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad, bent close to Paul’s face. She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face...but it was only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in Fremen life. Still....\n“You were not born to the spice as we were,” Chani said. “Have you investigated the possibility\nthat his body has rebelled against too much spice in his diet?”\n“Allergy reactions are all negative,” Jessica said.\nShe closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden realization of fatigue. How long have I been without sleep? she asked herself. Too long.\n“When you change the Water of Life,” Chani said, “you do it within yourself by the inward awareness. Have you used this awareness to test his blood?”\n“Normal Fremen blood,” Jessica said. “Completely adapted to the diet and the life here.”\nChani sat back on her heels, submerging her fears in thought as she studied Paul’s face. This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend Mothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire attention.\nPresently, Chani said: “Is there a maker here?”\n“There are several,” Jessica said with a touch of weariness. “We are never without them these days. Each victory requires its blessing. Each ceremony before a raid—”\n“But Paul-Muad’Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies,” Chani said.\nJessica nodded to herself, remembering her son’s ambivalent feelings toward the spice drug and the prescient awareness it precipitated.\n“How did you know this?” Jessica asked.\n“It is spoken.”\n“Too much is spoken,” Jessica said bitterly.\n“Get me the raw Water of the maker,” Chani said.\nJessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani’s voice, then observed the intense concentration in the younger woman and said: “At once.” She went out through\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Chani is the mother of Paul-Muad'Dib's son and a key figure in the Fremen community.
