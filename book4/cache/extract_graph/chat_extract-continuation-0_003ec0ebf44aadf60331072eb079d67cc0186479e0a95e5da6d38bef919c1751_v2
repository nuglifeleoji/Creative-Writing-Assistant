\n　　很明显，他不能在这家亲戚家住下去了。而且凑合一个晚上都不行——现在就得马上离开！ \n　　这没有什么可伤心的。他收拾起自己的行李，向他舅和他妗子告辞。 \n　　这两口子谁也没有挽留，甚到没有出门来送一送他。少平想起他做活的那家人对他的情义，第一次深深地感受到，人和人之间的友爱，并不在于是否是亲戚。是的，小时候，我们常常把亲戚这两字看得多么美好和重要。一旦长大成人，开始独立生活，我们便很快知道，亲戚关系常常是庸俗的；互相设法沾光，沾不上光就翻白眼；甚至你生活中最大的困难也常常是亲戚们造成的；生活同样会告诉你，亲戚往往不如朋友对你真诚。见鬼去吧，亲戚！ \n　　少平背着一卷烂被褥，手里提着那个破黄帆布提包，离开他的亲戚家，出了阳沟，来到了大街上。 \n　　落日再一次染红了梧桐山和古塔山。东方远远的天空飞起几朵红霞，边上镶着金色的亮光。 \n　　初伏已经来临，城市的傍晚一片燥热。街道两边枝叶繁茂的梧桐树下，市民们光着膀子坐在小凳上，悠闲地摇着薄扇。姑娘们大都穿起了裙子，五颜六色，花花绿绿，给这个色调暗淡的城市平添了许多斑斓景象。 \n　　少平背着自己的行李穿行于人群之中。不过，在这个花花绿绿的世界里，他此刻不再象初来时那般不自在。少平现在才感到，这样的城市是一个各色人等混杂的天地；而每一个层次的人又有自己的天地。最大的好处是，大街上谁也不认识谁，谁也不关心谁。他衣衫行装虽然破烂不堪，但只要不露羞丑，照样可以在这个世界里自由行走，别人连笑话你的兴趣都没有。 \n　　少平几乎没有认真考虑，两条腿就自动引导他穿过黄原河上的老桥，来到东关，加入了桥头上那个揽工汉的“王国”。 \n　　现在是夏天，虽然天将黄昏，但大部分等待“招工”工匠们仍然没有散去；人行道和自由市场的空地上，到处都是操北方各县口音的乡下人。有的人痛快地脱下汗迹斑斑的布褂，光身子坐在雪亮的路灯下聚精会神捉虱子。四处卖茶饭的小摊贩，拖长音调吆喝着招徕顾客。空气里弥漫着呛人的烟气黄尘；苍蝇成群结队地飞来飞去。 \n　　少平把铺盖卷仍然搁在砖墙边上，用两只烂手卷起一支旱烟棒，圪蹴在墙边抽起来。他现在看起来完全成了个老�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少平<|>PERSON<|>少平 is a character who is
