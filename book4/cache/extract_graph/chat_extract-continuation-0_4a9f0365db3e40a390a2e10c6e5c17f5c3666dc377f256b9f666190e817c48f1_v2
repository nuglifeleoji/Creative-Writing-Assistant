�么能死呢？她怎么会死呢？活着，是的，活着！亲爱的人，你只不过受了点伤，受了点惊吓，说不定我们还会明天从省城出发，赶到黄原去——因为后天，下午一点四十五分，我们还要在古塔山后面的杜梨树下相会…… \n　　孙少平双手蒙面伏在茶几上。泪水糊满了手掌。他浑身酸疼，疲惫不堪；似乎不是火车载着他，而是他拖着火车在向省城飞奔…… \n　　紧密的灯火在雨中大放光华。积水的街道被灯光映照成了一条条流金泻银的长河。 \n　　电车甩着长辫子，在夜空中碰击出蔚蓝色的火花。透过雨帘，街道两旁五光十色的大橱窗看起来象德加的印象画。他感到一阵又一阵眩晕。这世界现在一切都和他毫不相干！他在这世界上唯一要寻找的，要看见的，是那张甜蜜的笑脸。难道她真的不存在了吗？她仍然还活着吗？对他来说，答案还都不是最后的！他同时又执拗地相信，过一会，他就能看见她——活着的她；并且会紧紧地拥抱她……尽管他这样的昏乱，有一点还是清醒的——他先在旅馆为自己找了个住宿的地方，然后才搭上了去市中心的公共汽车。 \n　　他先并没有去找晓霞的父亲——他从晓霞不久前的信中知道，她父亲已经是这个城市的市委书记了。 \n　　他先来到了报社——只有这里才能证实他亲爱的人倒究是死了还是活着！ \n　　他的心狂跳着，走进报社大门。 \n　　“你找谁？”门房老头在窗户上探出头问他。老头当然不知他是谁。但他已经来过一次，认出这老头还是原来的老头。“我找田晓霞。”他声音沙哑着说，眼睛盯着老头的脸色。老头两眼瞪住他看了半天，才说：“这娃娃已经……死了。唉，实在是个好娃娃！连个尸首也没找见……你是她的什么人？”老头在自言自语中突然象梦中惊醒一般问他。 \n　　孙少平两眼一黑，腿软得如同抽了筋骨。他感到有热辣辣的东西从腿上淌下来——他禁不住小便在了裤子里……他没有回答老头的话，就转身走出报社大门。 \n　　大街上灯火辉煌，人头在伞下攒动；车辆飞溅着水花急驰而过。然而，他面对的却是一片沙漠——人生的沙漠啊……孙少平强忍着悲痛来到市委，打听了田福军的住处。 \n　　当他走到二楼那个房间的门口时，牙齿咬着嘴唇，停留片刻。 \n　　过了一会，他才抬起软绵绵的胳膊，在门上敲了敲。 \n                  第33章\n　　开门的是个男青年。 \n　　少平一惊：这张脸太象晓霞了！ \n　　不过，他很快明白，这是晓霞\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
