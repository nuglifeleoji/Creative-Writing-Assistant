We’re already amalgams of those lives within us. We don’t resist; we ride with them. This was what I learned from our father last night. It’s what | had to learn.”\n“He said nothing of that within me.”\n“You listened to our mother. It’s what we—”\n“And | almost lost.”\n“Is she still strong within you?” Fear tightened his face.\n“Yes ... but now | think she guards me with her love. You were very good when you argued with her.” And Ghanima thought about the reflected mother-within, said: “Our mother exists now for me in the alam al-mythal with the others, but she has tasted the fruit of hell. Now I can listen to her without fear. As to the others...”\n“Yes,” he said. “And | listened to my father, but I think I’m really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom | was named. Perhaps the name makes it easy.”\n“Are you counseled to speak to our grandmother of the Golden Path?”\nLeto waited while an attendant pressed past them with a basket-tray carrying the Lady Jessica’s breakfast. A strong smell of spice filled the air as the attendant passed.\n“She lives in us and in her own flesh,” Leto said. “Her counsel can be consulted twice.”\n“Not by me,” Ghanima protested. “I’m not risking that again.”\n“Then by me.”\n“I thought we agreed that she’s gone back to the Sisterhood.”\n“Indeed. Bene Gesserit at her beginning, her own creature in the middle, and Bene Gesserit at the end. But remember that she, too, carries Harkonnen blood and is\ncloser to it than we are, that she has experienced a form of this inner sharing which we have.”\n“A very shallow form,” Ghanima said. “And you haven't answered my question.”\n“I don’t think l'Il mention the Golden Path.”\n“| may.”\n“Ghani!”\n“We don’t need any more Atreides gods! We need a space for some humanity!”\n“Have | ever denied it?”\n“No.” She took a deep breath and looked away from him. Attendants peered in at them from the anteroom, hearing the argument by its tone but unable to understand the ancient words.\n“We have to do it,” he said. “If we fail to act, we might just as well fall upon our knives.” He used the Fremen form which carried the meaning of “spill our water into the tribal cistern.”\nOnce more Ghanima looked at him. She was forced to agree. But she felt trapped within a construction of many walls. They both knew a day of reckoning lay across their path no matter what they did. Ghanima knew this with a certainty reinforced by the data garnered from those other memory-lives, but now she feared the strength which she gave those other psyches by using the data of their experiences. They lurked like harpies within her, shadow demons waiting in ambush.\nExcept for her mother, who had held the fleshly power and had renounced it. Ghanima still felt shaken by that inner struggle, Knowing she would have lost but for Leto’s persuasiveness.\nLeto said his Golden Path led out of this trap. Except for the nagging realization that he withheld something from his vision, she could only accept his sincerity. He needed her fertile creativity to enrich the plan.\n“We'll be tested,” he said, knowing where her doubts led.\n“Not in the spice.”\n“Perhaps even there. Surely, in the desert and in the Trial of Possession.”\n“You never mentioned the Trial of Possession!” she accused. “Is that part of your dream?”\nHe tried to swallow in a dry throat, cursed this betrayal. “Yes.”\n“Then we will be... possessed?”\n“No.”\nShe thought about the Trial—that ancient Fremen examination whose ending most often brought hideous death. Then this plan had other complexities. It would take them onto an edge where a plunge to either side might not be countenanced by the human mind and that mind remain sane.\nKnowing where her thoughts meandered, Leto said: “Power attracts the psychotics. Always. That’s what we have to avoid within ourselves.”\n“You're sure we won't be. . . possessed?” “Not if we create the Golden Path.” Still doubtful, she said: “l'Il not bear your children, Leto.”\nHe shook his head, suppressing the inner betrayals, lapsed into the royal-formal form of the ancient tongue: “Sister mine, | love you more dearly than myself, but that is not the tender of my desires.”\n“Very well, then let us return to another argument before we join our grandmother. A knife slipped into Alia might settle most of our problems.”\n“If you believe that, you believe we can walk in mud and leave no tracks,” he said. “Besides, when has Alia ever given anyone an opportunity?”\n“There is talk about this Javid.”\n“Does Duncan show any signs of growing horns?”\nGhanima shrugged. “One poison, two poison.” It was the common label applied to the royal habit of cataloguing\ncompanions by their threat to your person, a mark of rulers everywhere.\n“We must do it my way,” he said.\n“The other way might be cleaner.”\nBy her reply, he knew she had finally suppressed her doubts and come around to agreement with his plan. The realization brought him no happiness. He found himself looking at his own hands, wondering if the dirt would cling.\nThis was Muad’Dib’s achievement: He saw the subliminal reservoir of each individual as an unconscious bank of memories going back to the primal cell of our common genesis. Each of us, he said, can measure out his distance from that common origin. Seeing this and telling of it, he made the audacious leap of decision. Muad’Dib set himself the task of integrating genetic memory into ongoing evaluation. Thus did he break through Time’s veils, making a single thing of the future and the past. That was Muad’Dib’s creation embodied in his son and his daughter.\n—TESTAMENT OF ARRAKIS BY HARQ AL-ADA\nF arad’n strode through the garden compound of his grandfather’s royal palace, watching his shadow grow shorter as the sun of Salusa Secundus climbed toward noon. He had to stretch himself a bit to keep step with the tall Bashar who accompanied him.\n“| have doubts, Tyekanik,” he said. “Oh, there’s no denying the attractions of a throne, but—” He drew ina deep breath. “—I have so many interests.”\nTyekanik, fresh from a savage argument with Farad’n’s mother, glanced sidelong at the Prince, noting how the lad’s flesh was firming as he approached his eighteenth birthday. There was less and less of Wensicia in him with each passing day and more and more of old Shaddam, who had preferred his private pursuits to the responsibilities of royalty. That was what had cost him the throne in the end, of course. He’d grown soft in the ways of command.\n“You have to make a choice,” Tyekanik said. “Oh, doubtless there’ll be time for some of your interests, but...”\nFarad’n chewed his lower lip. Duty held him here, but he felt frustrated. He would far rather have gone to the rock\nenclave where the sandtrout experiments were being conducted. Now there was a project with enormous potential: wrest the spice monopoly from the Atreides and anything might happen.\n“You're sure these twins will be... eliminated?”\n“Nothing absolutely certain, My Prince, but the prospects are good.”\nFarad’n shrugged. Assassination remained a fact of royal life. The language was filled with the subtle permutations of ways to eliminate important personages. By a single word, one could distinguish between poison in drink or poison in food. He presumed the elimination of the Atreides twins would be accomplished by a poison. It was not a pleasant thought. By all accounts the twins were a most interesting pair.\n“Would we have to move to Arrakis?” Farad’n asked.\n“It’s the best choice, put us at the point of greatest pressure.” Farad’n appeared to be avoiding some question and Tyekanik wondered what it might be.\n“I’m troubled, Tyekanik,” Farad’n said, speaking as they rounded a hedge corner and approached a fountain surrounded by giant black roses. Gardeners could be heard snipping beyond the hedges.\n“Yes?” Tyekanik prompted.\n“This, ah, religion which you've professed .. .”\n“Nothing strange about that, My Prince,” Tyekanik said and hoped his voice remained firm. “This religion speaks to the warrior in me. It’s a fitting religion for a Sardaukar.” That, at least, was true.\n“Yesss ... But my mother seems so pleased by it.” Damn Wensicia! he thought. She’s made her son suspicious.\n“I care not what your mother thinks,” Tyekanik said. “A man’s religion is his own affair. Perhaps she sees something in this that may help to put you on the throne.”\n“That was my thought,” Farad’n said.\nAhhh, this is a sharp lad! Tyekanik thought. He said: “Look into the religion for yourself; you’ll see at once why | chose it.”\n“Still... Muad’Dib’s preachings? He was an Atreides, after all.”\n“I can only say that the ways of God are mysterious,” Tyekanik said.\n“I see. Tell me, Tyvek, why’d you ask me to walk with you just now? It’s almost noon and usually you're off to someplace or other at my mother’s command this time of day.”\nTyekanik stopped at a stone bench which looked upon the fountain and the giant roses beyond. The splashing water soothed him and he kept his attention upon it as he spoke. “My Prince, I’ve done something which your mother may not like.” And he thought: /f he believes that, her damnable scheme will work. Tyekanik almost hoped Wensicia’s scheme would fail. Bringing that damnable Preacher here. She was insane. And the cost!\nAs Tyekanik remained silent, waiting, Farad’n asked: “All right, Tyek, what’ve you done?”\n“I’ve brought a practitioner of oneiromancy,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n shot a sharp glance at his companion. Some of the older Sardaukar played the dream-interpretation game, had done so increasingly since their defeat by that “Supreme Dreamer,” Muad’Dib. Somewhere within their dreams, they reasoned, might lay a way back to power and glory. But Tyekanik had always eschewed this play.\n“This doesn’t sound like you, Tyek,” Farad’n said.\n“Then I can only speak from my new religion,” he said, addressing the fountain. To speak of religion was, of course, why they’d risked bringing The Preacher here.\n“Then speak from this religion,” Farad’n said.\n“As My Prince commands.” He turned, looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled\ninto the path which House Corrino would follow. “Church and state, My Prince, even scientific reason and faith, and even more: progress and tradition—all of these are reconciled in the teachings of Muad’Dib. He taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and, sometimes, in their dreams. One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole.”\nIn spite of doubts which he could not dispel, Farad’n found himself impressed by these words. He heard a note of reluctant sincerity in Tyekan\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a central figure in the narrative, involved in deep philosophical and strategic discussions about the future and the Golden Path.
