8307, "completion_tokens": 0}}, "input": {"input": [" one of the women wore a mask, a cibus hood of shapeless, light-drinking black. She would see him clearly through the hood, he knew, but her features would never reveal themselves, not even to the most subtle instruments of penetration. The hood said that the Ixians or their inheritors were still at work in the Imperium. Both women wore one-piece uniforms of rich blue with the Atreides hawk in red braid at the left breast.\nIdaho studied them as they closed the door and faced him.\nThe masked woman had a blocky, powerful body. She moved with the deceptive care of a professional muscle\nfanatic. The other woman was graceful and slender with almond eyes in sharp, high-boned features. Idaho had the feeling that he had seen her somewhere, but he could not fix the memory. Both women carried needle knives in hip sheaths. Something about their movements told Idaho these women would be extremely competent with such weapons.\nThe slender one spoke first.\n“My name is Luli. Let me be the first to address you as Commander. My companion must remain anonymous. Our Lord Leto has commanded it. You may address her as Friend.”\n“Commander?” he asked.\n“It is the Lord Leto’s wish that you command his Royal Guard,” Luli said.\n“That so? Let’s go talk to him about it.”\n“Oh, no!” Luli was visibly shocked. “The Lord Leto will summon you when it is time. For now, he wishes us to make you comfortable and happy.”\n“And | must obey?”\nLuli merely shook her head in puzzlement.\n“Am | a slave?”\nLuli relaxed and smiled. “By no means. It’s just that the Lord Leto has many great concerns which require his personal attention. He must make time for you. He sent us because he was concerned about his Duncan Idaho. You have been a long time in the hands of the dirty Tleilaxu.”\nDirty Tleilaxu, \\daho thought.\nThat, at least, had not changed.\nHe was concerned, though, by a particular reference in Luli’s explanation.\n“His Duncan Idaho?”\n“Are you not an Atreides warrior?” Luli asked.\nShe had him there. Idaho nodded, turning his head Slightly to stare at the enigmatic masked woman.\n“Why are you masked?”\n“It must not be known that | serve the Lord Leto,” she said. Her voice was a pleasant contralto, but Idaho suspected that this, too, was masked by the cibus hood.\n“Then why are you here?”\n“The Lord Leto trusts me to determine if you have been tampered with by the dirty Tleilaxu.”\nIdaho tried to swallow in a suddenly dry throat. This thought had occurred to him several times aboard the Guild transport. If the Tleilaxu could condition a ghola to attempt the murder of a dear friend, what else might they plant in the psyche of the regrown flesh?\n“I see that you have thought about this,” the masked woman said.\n“Are you a mentat?” Idaho asked.\n“Oh, no!” Luli interrupted. “The Lord Leto does not permit the training of mentats.”\nIdaho glanced at Luli, then returned his attention to the masked woman. No mentats. The Tleilaxu history had not mentioned that interesting fact. Why would Leto prohibit mentats? Surely, the human mind trained in the super abilities of computation still had its uses. The Tleilaxu had assured him that the Great Convention remained in force and that mechanical computers were still anathema. Surely, these women would know that the Atreides themselves had used mentats.\n“What is your opinion?” the masked woman asked. “Have the dirty Tleilaxu tampered with your psyche?”\n“I don’t... think so.”\n“But you are not certain?”\n“No.”\n“Do not fear, Commander Idaho,” she said. “We have ways of making sure and ways of dealing with such problems should they arise. The dirty Tleilaxu have tried it only once and they paid dearly for their mistake.”\n“That’s reassuring. Did the Lord Leto send me any messages?”\nLuli spoke up: “He told us to assure you that he still loves you as the Atreides have always loved you.” She was obviously awed by her own words.\nIdaho relaxed slightly. As an old Atreides hand, superbly trained by them, he had found it easy to determine several things from this encounter. These two had been heavily conditioned to a fanatic obedience. If a cibus mask could hide the identity of that woman, there had to be many more whose bodies were very similar. All of this sooke of dangers around Leto which still required the old and subtle services of spies and an imaginative arsenal of weapons.\nLuli looked at her companion. “What say you, Friend?”\n“He may be brought to the Citadel,” the masked woman said. “This is not a good place. Tleilaxu have been here.”\n“A warm bath and change of clothing would be pleasant,” Idaho said.\nLuli continued to look at her Friend. “You are certain?”\n“The wisdom of the Lord cannot be questioned,” the masked woman said.\nIdaho did not like the sound of fanaticism in this Friend’s voice, but he felt secure in the integrity of the Atreides. They could appear cynical and cruel to outsiders and enemies, but to their own people they were just and they were loyal. Above all else, the Atreides were loyal to their own.\nAnd I am one of theirs, idaho thought. But what happened to the me that I am replacing? He felt strongly that these two would not answer this question.\nBut Leto will.\n“Shall we go?” he asked. “I’m anxious to wash the stink of the dirty Tleilaxu off me.”\nLuli grinned at him.\n“Come. | shall bathe you myself.”\nEnemies strengthen you.\nAllies weaken.\n| tell you this in the hope that it will help you understand why | act as | do in the full knowledge that great forces accumulate in my Empire with but one wish—the wish to destroy me. You who read these words may know full well what actually happened, but I doubt that you understand it.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe ceremony of “Showing” by which the rebels began\ntheir meetings dragged on interminably for Siona. She sat in the front row and looked everywhere but at Topri, who was conducting the ceremony only a few paces away. This room in the service burrows beneath Onn was one they had never used before but it was so like all of their other meeting places that it could have been used as a standard model.\nRebel Meeting Room—Class B, she thought.\nIt was officially designated as a storage chamber and the fixed glowglobes could not be tuned away from their blank white glaring. The room was about thirty paces long and Slightly less in width. It could be reached only through a labyrinthine series of similar chambers, one of which was conveniently stocked with a supply of stiff folding chairs intended for the small sleeping chambers of the service personnel. Nineteen of Siona’s fellow rebels now occupied these chairs around her, with a few empty for any latecomers who might still make the meeting.\nThe time had been set between the midnight and morning shifts to mask the flow of extra people in the service warrens. Most of the rebels wore energy-worker disguises—thin gray disposable trousers and jackets. Some\nfew, including Siona, were garbed in the green of machinery inspectors.\nTopri’s voice was an insistent monotone in the room. He did not squeak at all while conducting the ceremony. In fact, Siona had to admit he was rather good at it, especially with new recruits. Since Nayla’s flat statement that she did not trust the man, though, Siona had looked at Topri ina different way. Nayla could speak with a cutting naiveté which pulled away masks. And there were things that Siona had learned about Topri since that confrontation.\nSiona turned at last and looked at the man. The cold silvery light did not help Topri’s pale skin. He used a copy of a crysknife in the ceremony, a contraband copy bought from the Museum Fremen. Siona recalled the transaction as she looked at the blade in Topri’s hands. It had been Topri’s idea, and she had thought it a good one at the time. He had led her to the rendezvous in a hovel on the city’s outskirts, leaving Onn just at dusk. They had waited well into the night until darkness could mask the Museum Fremen’s coming. Fremen were not supposed to leave their sietch quarters without a special dispensation from the God Emperor.\nShe had almost given up on him when the Fremen arrived, slipping in out of the night, his escort left behind to guard the door. Topri and Siona had been waiting on a crude bench against a dank wall of the absolutely plain room. The only light had come from a dim yellow torch supported on a stick driven into the crumbling mud wall.\nThe Fremen’s first words had filled Siona with misgivings.\n“Have you brought the money?”\nBoth Topri and Siona had risen at his entry. Topri did not appear bothered by the question. He tapped the pouch beneath his robe, making it jingle.\n“I have the money right here.”\nThe Fremen was a wizened figure, crabbed and bent, wearing a copy of the old Fremen robes and some glistening garment underneath, probably their version of a stillsuit. His\nhood was drawn forward, shading his features. The torchlight sent shadows dancing across his face.\nHe peered first at Topri then at Siona before removing an object wrapped in cloth from beneath his robe.\n“It is a true copy, but it is made of plastic,” he said. “It will not cut cold grease.”\nHe pulled the blade from its wrappings then and held it up. Siona, who had seen crysknives only in museums and in the rare old visual recordings of her family’s archives, had found herself oddly gripped by the sight of the blade in this setting. She felt something atavistic working on her and imagined this poor Museum Fremen with his plastic crysknife as a real Fremen of the old days. The thing he held was suddenly a silver-bladed crysknife shimmering in the yellow shadows.\n“| guarantee the authenticity of the blade from which we copied it,” the Fremen said. He spoke in a low voice, somehow made menacing by its lack of emphasis.\nSiona heard it then, the way he carried his venom ina sleeve of soft vowels and she was suddenly alerted.\n“Try treachery and we will hunt you down like vermin,” she said.\nTopri shot a startled glance at her.\nThe Museum Fremen appeared to shrivel, drawing in upon himself. The blade trembled in his hand, but his gnome fingers still curled inward around it as though clasping a throat.\n“Treachery, Lady? Oh, no. But it occurred to us that we asked too little for this copy. Poor as it is, making it and selling it this way puts us in dreadful peril.”\nSiona glared at him, thinking of the old Fremen words from the Oral History: “Once you acquire a marketplace soul, the suk is the totality of existence.”\n“How much do you want?” she demanded.\nHe named a sum twice his original figure.\nTopri gasped.\nSiona looked at Topri. “Do you have that much?”\n“Not quite, but we agreed on...”\n“Give him what you have, all of it,” Siona said.\n“All of it?”\n“Isn't that what | said? Every coin in that bag.” She faced the Museum Fremen. “You will", " drawing in upon himself. The blade trembled in his hand, but his gnome fingers still curled inward around it as though clasping a throat.\n“Treachery, Lady? Oh, no. But it occurred to us that we asked too little for this copy. Poor as it is, making it and selling it this way puts us in dreadful peril.”\nSiona glared at him, thinking of the old Fremen words from the Oral History: “Once you acquire a marketplace soul, the suk is the totality of existence.”\n“How much do you want?” she demanded.\nHe named a sum twice his original figure.\nTopri gasped.\nSiona looked at Topri. “Do you have that much?”\n“Not quite, but we agreed on...”\n“Give him what you have, all of it,” Siona said.\n“All of it?”\n“Isn't that what | said? Every coin in that bag.” She faced the Museum Fremen. “You will accept this payment.” It was not a question and the old man heard her correctly. He wrapped the blade in its cloth and passed it to her.\nTopri handed over the pouch of coins, muttering under his breath.\nSiona addressed herself to the Museum Fremen. “We know your name. You are Teishar, aide to Garun of Tuono. You have a suk mentality and you make me shudder at what Fremen have become.”\n“Lady, we all have to live,” he protested.\n“You are not alive,” she said. “Be gone!”\nTeishar had turned and scurried away, clutching the money pouch close to his chest.\nMemory of that night did not sit well in Siona’s mind as she watched Topri wave the crysknife copy in their rebel ceremony. We're no better than Teishar, she thought. A copy is worse than nothing. Topri brandished the stupid blade over his head as he neared the ceremony’s conclusion.\nSiona looked away from him and stared at Nayla seated off to her left. Nayla was looking first one direction and now another. She paid special attention to the new cadre of recruits at the back of the room. Nayla did not give her trust easily. Siona wrinkled her nose as a stirring of the air brought the smell of lubricants. The depths of Onn always smelled dangerously mechanical! She sniffed. And this room! She did not like their meeting place. It could easily be a trap. Guards could seal off the outer corridors and send in armed searchers. This could be too easily the place where their rebellion ended. Siona was made doubly uneasy by the fact that this room had been Topri’s choice.\nOne of Ulot’s few mistakes, she thought. Poor dead Ulot had approved Topri’s admission to the rebellion.\n“He is a minor functionary in city services,” Ulot had explained. “Topri can find us many useful places to meet and arm ourselves.”\nTopri had reached almost the end of his ceremony. He placed the knife in an ornate case and put the case on the floor beside him.\n“My face is my pledge,” he said. He turned his profile to the room, first one side and then the other. “I show my face that you may know me anywhere and know that | am one of you.”\nStupid ceremony, Siona thought.\nBut she dared not break the pattern of it. And when Topri pulled a black gauze mask from a pocket and placed it over his head, she took out her own mask and donned it. Everyone in the room did the same thing. There was a stirring around the room now. Most of the people here had been alerted that Topri had brought a special visitor. Siona secured her mask’s tie behind her neck. She was anxious to see this visitor.\nTopri moved to the room’s one door. There was a clattering bustle as everyone stood and the chairs were folded and stacked against the wall opposite the door. At a signal from Siona, Topri tapped three times on the door panel, waited for a two-count, then tapped four times.\nThe door opened and a tall man in a dark brown official singlet slipped into the room. He wore no mask, his face open for all of them to see—thin and imperious with a narrow mouth, a skinny blade of a nose, dark brown eyes deeply set under bushy brows. It was a face recognized by most of the room’s occupants.\n“My friends,” Topri said, “I present Iyo Kobat, Ambassador from Ix.”\n“Ex-Ambassador,” Kobat said. His voice was guttural and tightly controlled. He took a position with his back to the\nwall facing the masked people in the room. “I have this day received orders from our God Emperor to leave Arrakis in disgrace.”\n“Why?”\nSiona snapped the question at him without formality.\nKobat jerked his head around, a quick movement which fixed his gaze on her masked face. “There has been an attempt on the God Emperor's life. He traced the weapon to me.”\nSiona’s companions opened a space between her and the ex-Ambassador, clearly signaling that they deferred to her.\n“Then why didn’t he kill you?” she demanded.\n“I think he is telling me that | am not worth killing. There is also the fact that he uses me now to carry a message to Ix.”\n“What message?” Siona moved through the cleared space to stop within two paces of Kobat. She recognized the sexual alertness in him as he studied her body.\n“You are Moneo’s daughter,” he said.\nSoundless tension exploded across the room. Why did he reveal that he recognized her? Who else did he recognize here? Kobat did not appear the fool. Why had he done this?\n“Your body, your voice and your manner are well known here in Onn,” he said. “That mask is a foolishness.”\nShe ripped the mask from her head and smiled at him. “I agree. Now answer my question.”\nShe heard Nayla move up close on her left; two more aides chosen by Nayla came up beside her.\nSiona saw the moment of realization come over Kobat— his death if he failed to satisfy her demands. His voice did not lose its tight control but he spoke slower, choosing his words more carefully.\n“The God Emperor has told me that he knows about an agreement between Ix and the Guild. We are attempting to make a mechanical amplifier of . . . those Guild navigational talents which presently rely on melange.”\n“In this room we call him the Worm,” Siona said. “What would your Ixian machine do?”\n“You are aware that Guild Navigators require the spice before they can see the safe path to traverse?”\n“You would replace the navigators with a machine?”\n“It may be possible.”\n“What message do you carry to your people concerning this machine?”\n“I am to tell my people that they may continue the project only if they send him daily reports on their progress.”\nShe shook her head. “He needs no such reports! That’s a stupid message.”\nKobat swallowed, no longer concealing nervousness.\n“The Guild and the Sisterhood are excited by our project,” he said. “They are participating.”\nSiona nodded once. “And they pay for their participation by sharing spice with Ix.”\nKobat glared at her. “It’s expensive work and we need the spice for comparative testing by Guild Navigators.”\n“It is a lie and a cheat,” she said. “Your device will never work and the Worm knows it.”\n“How dare you accuse us of...”\n“Be still! | have just told you the real message. The Worm is telling you Ixians to continue cheating the Guild and the Bene Gesserit. It amuses him.”\n“It could work!” Kobat insisted.\nShe merely smiled at him. “Who tried to kill the Worm?”\n“Duncan Idaho.”\nNayla gasped. There were other small signs of surprise around the room, a frown, an indrawn breath.\n“Is Idaho dead?” Siona asked.\n“| presume so, but the... ahhh, Worm refuses to confirm it.”\n“Why do you presume him dead?”\n“The Tleilaxu have sent another Idaho ghola.”\n“| see.”\nSiona turned and signaled to Nayla, who went to the side of the room and returned with a slim package wrapped in pink Suk paper, the kind of paper shopkeepers used to enclose small purchases. Nayla handed the package to Siona.\n“This is the price of our silence,” Siona said, extending the package to Kobat. “This is why Topri was permitted to bring you here tonight.”\nKobat took the package without removing his attention from her face.\n“Silence?” he asked.\n“We undertake not to inform the Guild and Sisterhood that you are cheating them.”\n“We are not cheat...”\n“Don’t be a fool!”\nKobat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her meaning had become plain to him: true or not, if the rebellion spread\nsuch a story it would be believed. It was “common sense” as\nTopri was fond of saying. Siona glanced at Topri who stood just behind Kobat. No\none joined this rebellion for reasons of “common sense.” Did\nTopri not realize that his “common sense” might betray him? She returned her attention to Kobat.\n“What’s in this package?” he asked.\nSomething in the way he asked it told Siona he already knew.\n“That is something | am sending to Ix. You will take it there for me. That is copies of two volumes we removed from the Worm’s fortress.”\nKobat stared down at the package in his hands. It was obvious that he wanted to drop the thing, that his venture into rebellion had loaded him with a burden more deadly than he had expected. He shot a scowling glance at Topri which said as though he had spoken it: “Why didn’t you warn me?”\n“What...” He brought his gaze back to Siona, cleared his throat. “What’s in these... . volumes?”\n“Your people may tell us that. We think they are the Worm’s own words, written in a cipher which we cannot read.”\n“What makes you think we...”\n“You Ixians are clever at such things.”\n“And if we fail?”\nShe shrugged. “We will not blame you for that. However, should you use those volumes for any other purpose or fail to report a success fully...”\n“How can anyone be Sure we...”\n“We will not depend only on you. Others will get copies. | think the Sisterhood and the Guild will not hesitate to try deciphering those volumes.”\nKobat slipped the package under his arm and pressed it against his body.\n“What makes you think the... the Worm doesn’t know about your intentions ... even about this meeting?”\n“I think he knows many such things, that he may even know who took those volumes. My father believes he is truly prescient.”\n“Your father believes the Oral History!”\n“Everyone in this room believes it. The Oral History does not disagree with the Formal History on important matters.”\n“Then why doesn’t the Worm act against you?”\nShe pointed to the package under Kobat’s arm. “Perhaps the answer is in there.”\n“Or you and these cryptic volumes are no real threat to him!” Kobat was not concealing his anger. He did not like being forced into decisions.\n“Perhaps. Tell me why you mentioned the Oral History.”\nOnce more, Kobat heard the menace.\n“It says the Worm is incapable of human emotions.”\n“That is not the reason,” she said. “You will get one more chance to tell me the reason.”\nNayla moved two steps closer to Kobat.\n“I... Iwas told to review the Oral History before coming here, that your people . . .” He shrugged.\n“That we chant it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Who told", " he is truly prescient.”\n“Your father believes the Oral History!”\n“Everyone in this room believes it. The Oral History does not disagree with the Formal History on important matters.”\n“Then why doesn’t the Worm act against you?”\nShe pointed to the package under Kobat’s arm. “Perhaps the answer is in there.”\n“Or you and these cryptic volumes are no real threat to him!” Kobat was not concealing his anger. He did not like being forced into decisions.\n“Perhaps. Tell me why you mentioned the Oral History.”\nOnce more, Kobat heard the menace.\n“It says the Worm is incapable of human emotions.”\n“That is not the reason,” she said. “You will get one more chance to tell me the reason.”\nNayla moved two steps closer to Kobat.\n“I... Iwas told to review the Oral History before coming here, that your people . . .” He shrugged.\n“That we chant it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Who told you this?”\nKobat swallowed, cast a fearful glance at Topri, then back to Siona.\n“Topri?” Siona asked.\n“I thought it would help him to understand us,” Topri said.\n“And you told him the name of your leader,” Siona said.\n“He already knew!” Topri’s voice had found its squeak.\n“What particular parts of the Oral History were you told to review?” Siona asked.\n“The ... uhhh, the Atreides line.”\n“And now you think you know why people join me in rebellion.”\n“The Oral History tells exactly how he treats everyone in the Atreides line!” Kobat said.\n“He gives us a little rope and then he hauls us in?” Siona asked. Her voice was deceptively flat.\n“That’s what he did with your own father,” Kobat said.\n“And now he’s letting me play at rebellion?”\n“I’m just a messenger,” Kobat said. “If you kill me, who will carry your message?”\n“Or the message of the Worm,” Siona said.\nKobat remained silent.\n“I do not think you understand the Oral History,” Siona said. “I think also you do not Know the Worm very well, nor do you understand his messages.”\nKobat’s face flushed with anger. “What’s to prevent you from becoming like all the rest of the Atreides, a nice obedient part of .. .” Kobat broke off, aware suddenly of what anger had made him Say.\n“Just another recruit for the Worm’s inner circle,” Siona said. “Just like the Duncan Idahos?”\nShe turned and looked at Nayla. The two aides, Anouk and Taw, became suddenly alert, but Nayla remained impassive.\nSiona nodded once to Nayla.\nAs they were sworn to do, Anouk and Taw moved to positions blocking the door. Nayla went around to stand at Topri’s shoulder.\n“What’s ... what's happening?” Topri asked.\n“We wish to know everything of importance that the ex- Ambassador can share with us,” Siona said. “We want the entire message.”\nTopri began to tremble. Perspiration started from Kobat’s forehead. He glanced once at Topri, then returned his attention to Siona. That one glance was like a veil pulled aside for Siona to peer into the relationship between these two.\nShe smiled. This merely confirmed what she had already learned.\nKobat became very still.\n“You may begin,” Siona said.\n“I... what do you...”\n“The Worm gave you a private message for your masters. | will hear it.”\n“He... he wants an extension for his cart.”\n“Then he expects to grow longer. What else?”\n“We are to send him a large supply of ridulian crystal paper.”\n“For what purpose?”\n“He never explains his demands.”\n“This smacks of things he forbids to others,” she said.\nKobat spoke bitterly. “He never forbids himself anything!”\n“Have you made forbidden toys for him?”\n“I do not know.”\nHe’s lying, she thought, but she chose not to pursue this. It was enough to know the existence of another chink in the Worm’s armor.\n“Who will replace you?” Siona asked.\n“They are sending a niece of Malky,” Kobat said. “You may remember that he...”\n“We remember Malky,” she said. “Why does a niece of Malky become the new Ambassador?”\n“I don’t know. But it was ordered even before the Go... the Worm dismissed me.”\n“Her name?”\n“Hwi Noree.”\n“We will cultivate Hwi Noree,” Siona said. “You were not worth cultivating. This Hwi Noree may be something else. When do you return to |x?”\n“Immediately after the Festival, the first Guild ship.”\n“What will you tell your masters?”\n“About what?”\n“My message!”\n“They will do as you ask.”\n“I know. You may go, ex-Ambassador Kobat.”\nKobat almost collided with the door guards in his haste to leave. Topri made to follow him, but Nayla caught Topri’s arm and held him. Topri swept a fearful glance across Nayla’s muscular body, then looked at Siona, who waited for the door to shut behind Kobat before speaking.\n“The message was not merely to the Ixians, but to us as well,” she said. “The Worm challenges us and tells us the rules of the combat.”\nTopri tried to wrest his arm from Nayla’s grip. “What do you...”\n“Topri!” Siona said. “I, too, can send a message. Tell my father to inform the Worm that we accept.”\nNayla released his arm. Topri rubbed the place where she had gripped him. “Surely you don’t...”\n“Leave while you can and never come back,” Siona said.\n“You can’t possibly mean that you sus...”\n“I told you to leave! You are clumsy, Topri. | have been in the Fish Speaker schools for most of my life. They taught me\nto recognize clumsiness.”\n“Kobat is leaving. What harm was there in...”\n“He not only knew me, he knew what | had stolen from the Citadel! But he did not know that | would send that package to Ix with him. Your actions have told me that the Worm wants me to send those volumes to Ix!”\nTopri backed away from Siona toward the door. Anouk and Taw opened a passage for him, swung the door wide. Siona followed him with her voice.\n“Do not argue that it was the Worm who spoke of me and my package to Kobat! The Worm does not send clumsy messages. Tell him | said that!”\nSome say | have no conscience. How false they are, even to themselves. | am the only conscience which has ever existed. As wine retains the perfume of its cask, | retain the essence of my most ancient genesis, and that is the seed of conscience. That is what makes me holy. | am God because | am the only one who really knows his heredity!\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nThe Inquisitors of Ix having assembled in the Grand Palais with the candidate for Ambassador to the Court of the Lord Leto, the following questions and answers were recorded:\nINQUISITOR: You indicate that you wish to speak to us of the Lord Leto’s motives. Speak.\nHWI NOREE: Your Formal Analyses do not satisfy the questions | would raise.\nINQUISITOR: What questions?\nHWI NOREE: | ask myself what would motivate the Lord Leto to accept this hideous transformation, this worm-body, this loss of his humanity? You suggest merely that he did it for power and for long life.\nINQUISITOR: Are those not enough?\nHWI NOREE: Ask yourselves if one of you would make such payment for so paltry a return?\nINQUISITOR: From your infinite wisdom then, tell us why the Lord Leto chose to become a worm.\nHWI NOREE: Does anyone here doubt his ability to predict the future?\nINQUISITOR: Now then! Is that not payment enough for his transformation?\nHWI NOREE: But he already had the prescient ability as did his father before him. No! | propose that he made this desperate choice because he saw in our future something that only such a sacrifice would prevent.\nINQUISITOR: What was this peculiar thing which only he saw in our future?\nHWI NOREE: | do not know, but | propose to discover it.\nINQUISITOR: You make the tyrant appear a selfless servant of the people!\nHWI NOREE: Was that not a prominent characteristic of his Atreides Family?\nINQUISITOR: SO the official histories would have us believe.\nHWI NOREE: The Oral History affirms it.\nINQUISITOR: What other good character would you give to the tyrant Worm?\nHWI NOREE: Good character, sirra?\nINQUISITOR: Character, then?\nHWI NOREE: My Uncle Malky often said that the Lord Leto was given to moods of great tolerance for selected companions.\nINQUISITOR: Other companions he executes for no apparent reason.\nHWI NOREE: | think there are reasons and my Uncle Malky deduced some of those reasons.\nINQUISITOR: Give US One such deduction.\nHWI NOREE: Clumsy threats to his person.\nINQUISITOR: Clumsy threats now!\nHWI NOREE: And he does not tolerate pretensions. Recall the execution of the historians and the destruction of their works.\nINQUISITOR: He does not want the truth known!\nHWI NOREE: He told my Uncle Malky that they lied about the past. And mark you! Who would know this better than he? We all know the subject of his introversion.\nINQUISITOR: What proof have we that all of his ancestors live in him?\nHWI NOREE: | will not enter that bootless argument. | will merely say that | believe it on the evidence of my Uncle Malky’s belief, and his reasons for that belief.\nINQUISITOR: We have read your uncle’s reports and interpret them otherwise. Malky was overly fond of the Worm.\nHWI NOREE: My uncle accounted him the most supremely artful diplomat in the Empire, a master conversationalist and expert in any subject you could name.\nINQUISITOR: Did your uncle not speak of the Worm’s brutality?\nHWI NOREE: My uncle judged him ultimately civilized.\nINQUISITOR: | asked about brutality.\nHWI NOREE: Capable of brutality, yes.\nINQUISITOR: Your uncle feared him.\nHWI NoREE: The Lord Leto lacks all innocence and naiveté. He is to be feared only when he pretends these traits. That was what my uncle said.\nINQUISITOR: Those were his words, yes.\nHWI NOREE: More than that! Malky said, “The Lord Leto delights in the surprising genius and diversity of humankind. He is my favorite companion.”\nINQUISITOR: Giving us the benefit of your supreme wisdom, how do you interpret these words of your uncle?\nHWI NOREE: Do not mock me!\nINQUISITOR: We do not mock. We seek enlightenment.\nHWI NOREE: These words of Malky, and many other things that he wrote directly to me, suggest that the Lord Leto is always seeking after newness and originality but that he is wary of the destructive potential in such things. So my uncle believed.\nINQUISITOR: Is there more which you wish to add to these beliefs which you share with your uncle?\nHWI NOREE: | See no point in adding to what I’ve already said. | am sorry to have wasted the Inquisitors’"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_0c2c5c8da89031a62b4e7c8edd8f147bcee942951a99f4dc5656ec14ec434a43_v2"}
