\n　　晚上亮灯的时候，少平正破例和几个同学在宿舍打扑克，跛女子侯玉英突然来找他。 \n　　她也不进宿舍来，踮着脚立在门口，让少平出来一下，说她有个话要给他说。 \n　　少平看见她脸上带着一种紧张和激动，并且气喘嘘嘘的，不知发生了什么事，就把手里的扑克塞给旁边一个观战的同学，跳下炕走了出来。 \n　　在院子里，侯玉英悄悄地对他说：“郝红梅做下丢脸事了！”她说这话的时候，脸上露出一副幸灾乐祸的神色。“什么事？”少平的头皮一阵发麻。他心想，红梅和养民是不是有什么不规矩行为，让人家捉住了？马上要分手，说不定两人感情冲动……“你猜！”侯玉英故弄玄虚地向他挤了挤眼。 \n　　少平着急地说：“你快说是什么事嘛！我猜不着！”侯玉英这才一脸的神秘，说：“郝红梅在二门市上偷手帕，让售货员抓住了！” \n　　“啊？”少平一下子震惊得张开嘴巴，“什么时候？”“今天下午快吃饭的时候。” \n　　“现在她人在哪儿？” \n　　“二门市后面一个办公窑里锁着。我爸让我到学校来找领导……” \n　　“你去了没有？”少平一步跨到侯玉英面前，瞪着眼问她。

\n　　现在，她看见少平一脸凶相，很奇怪他听了这事为什么不高兴，反而给她瞪眼睛？好象她侯玉英倒成了个贼娃子！ \n　　她看少平这样逼问她，只好说：“我还没顾上找领导呢……” \n　　“你不能去找！”少平仍然很凶狠地瞪着眼，“对谁也不能说！也不能对顾养民说！你听见了没？你要是说了，我就掐死你！” \n　　侯玉英吓得跛腿倒退了一步，惊慌地看着孙少平，以为这个人疯了。
