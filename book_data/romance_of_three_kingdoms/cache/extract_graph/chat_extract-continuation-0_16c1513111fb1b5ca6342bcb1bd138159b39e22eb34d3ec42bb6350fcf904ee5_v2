�交战，斗得八九合，于禁败走。张郃出迎，战二十合亦败走。李通出迎，超奋威交战，数合之中，一枪刺李通于马下。超把枪望后一招，西凉兵一齐冲杀过来。操兵大败。西凉兵来得势猛，左右将佐，皆抵当不住。马超、庞德、马岱引百余骑，直入中军来捉曹操。操在乱军中，只听得西凉军大叫：“穿红袍的是曹操！”操就马上急脱下红袍。又听得大叫：“长髯者是曹操！”操惊慌，掣所佩刀断其髯。军中有人将曹操割髯之事，告知马超，超遂令人叫拿：“短髯者是曹操！”操闻知，即扯旗角包颈而逃。后人有诗曰：“潼关战败望风逃，孟德怆惶脱锦袍。剑割髭髯应丧胆，马超声价盖天高。”\n\n    曹操正走之间，背后一骑赶来，回头视之，正是马超。操大惊。左右将校见超赶来，各自逃命，只撤下曹操。超厉声大叫曰：“曹操休走！”操惊得马鞭坠地。看看赶上，马超从后使枪搠来。操绕树而走，超一枪搠在树上；急拔下时，操已走远。超纵马赶来，山坡边转过一将，大叫：“勿伤吾主！曹洪在此！”轮刀纵马，拦住马超。操得命走脱。洪与马超战到四五十合，渐渐刀法散乱，气力不加。夏侯渊引数十骑随到。马超独自一人，恐被所算，乃拨马而回，夏侯渊也不来赶。\n\n    曹操回寨，却得曹仁死据定了寨栅，因此不曾多折军马。操入帐叹曰：“吾若杀了曹洪，今日必死于马超之手也！”遂唤曹洪，重加赏赐。收拾败军，坚守寨栅，深沟高垒，不许出战。超每日引兵来寨前辱骂搦战。操传令教军士坚守，如乱动者斩。诸将曰：“西凉之兵，尽使长枪，当选弓弩迎之。”操曰：“战与不战，皆在于我，非在贼也。贼虽有长枪，安能便刺？诸公但坚壁观之，贼自退矣。”诸将皆私相议曰：“丞相自来征战，一身当先；今败于马超，何如此之弱也？”\n\n    过了几日，细作报来：“马超又添二万生力兵来助战，乃是羌人部落。”操闻知大喜。诸将曰：“马超添兵，丞相反喜。何也？”操曰：“待吾胜了，却对汝等说。”三日后又报关上又添军马。操又大喜，就于帐中设宴作贺。诸将皆暗笑。操曰：“诸公笑我无破马超之谋，公等有何良策？”徐晃进曰：“今丞相盛兵在此，贼亦全部现屯关上，此\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
