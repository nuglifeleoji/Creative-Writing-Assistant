She is a wealthy individual who supports the narrator's research, contributing to a comfortable lifestyle. As a Japanese-Chinese physicist, she works for a Japanese company and is affiliated with the organization known as ‘科学边界’ (Science Frontier), where she is recognized for her concise communication style, earning her the nickname \"\"女海明威\"\" (the female Hemingway) among her peers.\n\nIn her professional capacity, Shen Yufei demonstrates exceptional mathematical ability and a keen interest in the three-body problem, a complex issue in physics. She actively engages in discussions about this topic and offers the narrator access to valuable computing resources for research. Her involvement in a national key project highlights her significance in the scientific community, where she collaborates with colleagues, including 汪淼 (Wang Miao), and navigates the challenges associated with their work.\n\nShen Yufei's character is also marked by her ideological conflicts, particularly with 潘寒 (Pan Han), with whom she argues about their differing views and the implications of their actions. This tension underscores her role as a critical thinker who is not afraid to voice her opinions. Additionally, she is depicted as a supportive figure, silently backing 汪淼 and providing him with encouragement during moments of uncertainty about the future.\n\nDespite her professional achievements, Shen Yufei's life takes a darker turn when she becomes a victim found at a crime scene, previously seen engaging with a game called 《三体》 (The Three-Body Problem). This incident suggests her involvement in a mysterious situation that intertwines her personal and professional life. Furthermore, she is implicated in a narrative where she is accused of being a traitor by 潘寒, adding layers of complexity to her character.\n\nIn her personal life, Shen Yufei is the wife of 魏成 (Wei Cheng), which adds another dimension to her character as she balances her relationships with her professional responsibilities. Additionally, she is identified as a member of the降临派 (Arrival Faction), where she provides evidence regarding the faction's betrayal, indicating her deep involvement in the overarching narrative of conflict and loyalty.\n\nOverall, Shen Yufei is portrayed as a dynamic character whose wealth, intellect, and relationships significantly influence the lives of those around her, while her involvement in scientific research and ideological debates positions her at the center of a complex narrative filled with intrigue and tension.\",26\r\n250,别墅区,\"别墅区 is a high-end residential area located on the outskirts of the city, known for its luxurious living conditions and serene environment.

Within its walls, there are indications of violence, including a room with a light on, suggesting a disturbance that has occurred. This duality of the别墅 as both a sanctuary for research and a site of conflict adds complexity to its role in the story.\n\nOverall, the别墅 encapsulates a range of experiences, from the peaceful coexistence of the narrator and Shen Yufei to the unsettling presence of crime and violence, making it a pivotal element in the unfolding narrative.\",2\r\n191,三菱电机,三菱电机 is a Japanese company where 申玉菲 previously worked in a laboratory focused on nanomaterials research.,1\r\n253,电脑,\"The 电脑 is the device that 申玉菲 uses to play games, indicating a technological environment.\",1\r\n255,感应服,The 感应服 is a piece of technology that enhances the gaming experience by simulating physical sensations.,1\r\n256,头盔,The 头盔 is a virtual reality device that provides a full perspective display for the game.,1\r\n578,佛祖,\"Buddha is a religious figure that 申玉菲 prays to, seeking blessings for her \"\"master\"\" to escape suffering.\",1\r\n588,枪,枪是申玉菲用来威胁其丈夫继续研究三体问题的武器。,1\r\n188,科学边界,\"The concept of \"\"科学边界\"\" (scientific boundaries) is a significant topic of investigation, particularly in relation to the suicides of physicists.
