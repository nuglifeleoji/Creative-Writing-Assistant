小窗又凝视了父亲一会儿。这时，夕阳的光缕已离开了父亲，把他遗弃在一片朦胧中，但他的目光穿透这朦胧，看着投在对面墙上的最后一小片余晖。虽然即将消逝，但这时的夕阳是最美的。这夕阳最后的光辉也曾照在怒海的万顷波涛上。那是几道穿透西方乱云的光柱，在黑云下的海面上投下几片巨大的金色光斑，像自天国飘落的花瓣，花瓣之外是黑云下暗夜般的世界。暴雨像众神的帷幔悬挂在天海之间，只有闪电不时照亮那巨浪吐出的千堆雪。处于一个金色光斑中的驱逐舰艰难地把舰首从深深的浪谷中抬起来。在一声轰然的巨响中，舰首撞穿一道浪墙，腾起的漫天浪沫贪婪地吸收着夕阳的金光，像一只大鹏展开了金光四射的巨翅……\n　　章北海戴上军帽，帽檐上有中国太空军的军徽。他在心里说：爸爸，我们想的一样，这是我的幸运，我不会带给您荣耀，但会让您安息。\n　　“罗老师，请把衣服换了吧。”刚进门的年轻人说，蹲下来拉开他带进来的提包，尽管他显得彬彬有礼，罗辑心里还是像吃了苍蝇似的不舒服。但当年轻人把包中的衣服拿出来时，罗辑才知道那不是给嫌犯穿的东西，而是一件看上去很普通的棕色夹克，他接过衣服翻着看了看，夹克的料子很厚实，接着发现史强和年轻人也穿着这种夹克，只是颜色不同。\n　　“穿上吧，还算透气舒服的，要是穿我们以前的那种破玩意儿，不闷死你才怪。”史强说。\n　　“防弹衣。”年轻人解释说。\n　　谁会杀我呢？罗辑边换衣服边想。\n　　三人走出了房间，沿着来时的走廊走向电梯。走廊上方有方形的铁皮通风管，他们经过的几道门都是厚重密封型的。罗辑还注意到一侧斑驳的墙壁上有一行隐约可见的标语，只能看清其中的一部分。但罗辑知道全部：深挖洞、广积粮、不称霸。\n　　“这是个人防工事吧？”罗辑问史强。\n　　“不是普通的，是防原子弹的，现在废了，当年可不是一般人能进来的。”\n　　“那我们在……西山？”罗辑听到过这类传说，史强和年轻人都没有回答。他们走进了那部旧式电梯，电梯立刻带着很大的磨擦杂音向上开动了，操作电梯的是一名背着冲锋枪的武警士兵，他显然也是第一次干这个，很不熟练地调整了两三次，才把电梯停在-1
