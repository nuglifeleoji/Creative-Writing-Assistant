They were assigned as a team to protect the ghola, Duncan, and are currently missing, suggesting their mission has taken them into uncertain or dangerous circumstances. Teg coordinates closely with Lucilla in their shared duty, but their collaboration is not without tension. He is wary of her plans for Duncan, believing they could jeopardize Duncan's mental stability, and actively works to counter them.  \n\nOn a personal level, Lucilla reminds Teg of someone from his past, creating an unspoken connection that adds depth to their interactions. This familiarity may influence their dynamic, blending professional duty with underlying emotional resonance. Despite their disagreements, their shared objective—protecting Duncan—remains central to their partnership. Their current disappearance raises questions about the challenges they face and the unresolved conflict between Teg's protective instincts and Lucilla's intentions.  \n\nIn summary, Miles Teg and Lucilla are bound by duty, personal history, and conflicting perspectives, making their alliance both strategic and fraught with tension.
