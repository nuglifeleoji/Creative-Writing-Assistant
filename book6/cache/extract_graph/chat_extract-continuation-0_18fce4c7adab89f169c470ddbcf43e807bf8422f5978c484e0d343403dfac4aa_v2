没有做。”纸上写着几个粗体字：上帝死了。\n　　“为什么？”吴岳抬头问道。\n　　“这不是很明显的事吗，上帝没死吗，去他妈的主的安排，去他妈的温和的轭！”（1）\n　　①源自弥尔顿的诗《我的失明》：神勒令人们工作/难道却不给予光明吗/我痴痴地问道/但是“忍耐”想要阻止这喃语/就马上回答道，神并不需要人工或人自已的才斌/谁能最好地承受他温和的轭/就侍奉得他最好。\n　　吴岳无语地看了希恩斯一会儿，转身走下台阶。\n　　希恩斯在台阶上对着已经走进信念碑阴影中的吴岳大声说：“先生，我想掩盖对您的鄙视，但我做不到！”\n　　第二天，希恩斯和山杉惠子终于等来了他们期待的人。这天上午，从门外明媚的阳光中走进来四人，三个欧洲面孔的男性和一个东方相貌的女性，他们都很年轻，身材挺拔，步伐稳健，看上去自信而成熟。但希恩斯和惠子都从他们眼中看到了一种似曾相识的东西，那就是吴岳眼中的那种忧郁和迷茫。\n　　他们把自己的证件整齐地排放在接待台上，为首的一位庄重地说：“我们是太空军军官，来获取胜利信念。”\n　　思想钢印的操作过程十分快捷，信念簿在十人监督小组的成员手中传递，他们每个人都仔细地核对了上面的内容，并在公证书上签字。然后，在他们的监督下，第一位自愿者接过了信念簿，坐到了思想钢印的扫描器下，他的面前有一个小平台，他把信念簿放到上面，在平台的右下角有一个红色按钮。他打开信念簿，有一个声音提问：“您确信自己要获取对这个命题的信念吗？如果是，请按按钮；如果不是，请离开扫描区。”\n　　这样的提问重复了三遍，在均得到确定同答后，按钮发出红光，一个定位装置缓缓地合拢，固定了自愿者的头部，那个声音说：“思想钢印准备启动，请默读命题，然后按动按钮。”\n　　当按钮被按下时，它发出绿光，大约半分钟后，绿光熄灭，提示声音说：“思想钢印操作完成。”定位装置分离，自愿者起身离开。\n　　当四名完成操作的军官都回到门厅时，山杉惠子仔细观察着他们，她很快肯定不是自己的心理作用：四双眼睛中，忧郁和迷茫消失了，日光宁静如水。\n　　“你们感觉怎么样？”她微笑着问道。\n　　“很好，”一位年轻军官也对她回应着微笑，“应该是这样的。”\n　　在他们离去时，那个东方姑娘回身加了一句：“博士，真的很好，谢谢您。”\n　　从这一时刻起，至少在这四个年轻人的心中，未来是确定的。\n　　从这天开始，获取信念的太空军成员不断到来，开始多是一个人前来，后来则成群结队。开始来人都穿便服\n######################\nOutput:",
