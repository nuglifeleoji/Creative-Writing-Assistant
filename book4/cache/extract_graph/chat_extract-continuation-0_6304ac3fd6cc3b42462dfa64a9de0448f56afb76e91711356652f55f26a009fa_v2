：“她留给我们的主要纪念就是十几本日记。这三本是记述你们之间感情的，就由你去保存。读她的日记，会感到她还和我们生活在一起。” \n　　孙少平接过这三本彩色塑料皮日记本，随手打开了一本，那熟悉的、象男孩子一样刚健的字便跳入了眼帘——……酷暑已至，常去旁边的冶金学院游泳，晒得快成了黑炭头。时时想念我那“掏炭的男人”。这相念象甘甜的美酒一样令人沉醉。爱情对我虽是“初见端倪”，但已使我一洗尘泥，飘飘欲仙了。我放纵我的天性，相信爱情能给予人创造的力量。我为我的“掏炭丈夫”感到骄傲。是的，真正的爱情不应该是利己的，而应该是利他的，是心甘情愿地与爱人一起奋斗并不断地自我更新的过程；是溶合在一起——完全溶合在一起的共同斗争！你有没有决心为他（她）而付出自己的最大牺牲，这是衡量是不是真正爱情的标准，否则就是被自己的感情所欺骗……孙少平的视线被泪水模糊了。他合住日记本，似乎那些话不是他看见的，而是她俯在他耳边亲口说给他听的……当田福军搂着他的肩头来到客厅的时候，晓晨旁边又多了一位穿素淡衣服的姑娘——她不是晓晨的妻子抑或就是他的未婚妻。他们要带他去吃饭。 \n　　但少平谢绝了。他说他已经吃过饭，现在就回他住宿的地方去。田福军让晓晨到值班室叫了一辆小车，把他送到了火车站附近的那个旅馆。 \n　　孙少平回到旅馆后，立刻又决定他当晚搬到黄原办事处住。他明天要赶回黄原——办事处每天有发往那里的班车。 \n　　他明天一定要赶回黄原！因为后天，就是晓霞和他约定在古塔山后面相会的日子。她已经离开了人世，但他还要和她如期地在那地方相会！ \n　　他想起了《热妮娅·鲁勉采娃》。是的，命运将使他重复这个故事的结局。在这个世界上，在人的生活里，常常会有这样的“巧合”。这不是艺术故事，而是活生生的人的遭遇！当天晚上，他就到了黄原办事处。 \n　　第二天黎明，他搭乘长途公共汽车，向那个告别了两年的城市赶去。 \n　　汽车天黑时才驶进黄原城。 \n　　又是华灯初上了。一切是那样熟悉。高原凉爽的晚风扑面而来。市声之外，是黄原河与小南河朗朗的流水声。暮霭围罩着远山，天边有几点星光在闪烁。 \n　　黄原，我的慈祥而严厉的父亲！我又回到了你的怀抱。我是来这里寻找往日那些失落了的梦？是寻找我的甜蜜和辛酸？寻找我的流逝了的青春和幸福？\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
