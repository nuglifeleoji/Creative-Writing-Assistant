It serves as a linguistic tool for conveying hidden meanings, as demonstrated when Jessica uses it to communicate covertly with Alia during a confrontation. Additionally, Chakobsa is integral to Fremen culture, particularly in their educational practices, where it is taught to children through rhythmic chanting. This language embodies both practical and ceremonial functions, bridging everyday communication and deeper, esoteric exchanges within Fremen and Bene Gesserit traditions.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight Chakobsa's dual role: as a means of clandestine dialogue among the Bene Gesserit and as a foundational element of Fremen pedagogy and cultural identity.
