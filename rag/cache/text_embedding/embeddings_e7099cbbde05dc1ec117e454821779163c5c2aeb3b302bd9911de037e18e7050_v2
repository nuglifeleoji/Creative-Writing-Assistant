have done by herself. He made her tie off the knot with her free hand, holding one end of the bandage in her teeth.\n“Now let’s look at the leg,” he said.\nShe twisted around to present the other wound. It was not as bad: two shallow claw cuts along the calf. They had bled\nfreely into the stillsuit, however. He cleaned it up as best he could, bound the wound beneath the stillsuit. He sealed the suit over the bandage.\n“I got sand in it,” he said. “Have it treated as soon as you get back.”\n“Sand in our wounds,” she said. “That’s an old story for Fremen.”\nHe managed a smile, sat back.\nGhanima took a deep breath. “We've pulled it off.”\n“Not yet.”\nShe swallowed, fighting to recover from the aftermath of shock. Her face appeared pale in the light of the glowglobe. And she thought: Yes, we must move fast now. Whoever controlled those tigers could be out there right now.\nLeto, staring at his sister, felt a sudden wrenching sense of loss. It was a deep pain which shot through his breast. He and Ghanima must separate now. For all of those years since birth they had been as one person. But their plan demanded now that they undergo a metamorphosis, going their separate ways into uniqueness where the sharing of daily experiences would never again unite them as they once had been united.\nHe retreated into the necessarily mundane. “Here’s my Fremkit. | took the bandages from it. Someone may look.”\n“Yes.” She exchanged kits with him.\n“Someone out there has a transmitter for those cats,” he said. “Most likely he'll be waiting near the qanat to make certain of us.”\nShe touched her maula pistol where it sat atop the Fremkit, picked it up and thrust it into the sash beneath her robe. “My robe’s torn.”\n“Yes.”\n“Searchers may get here soon,” he said. “They may have a traitor among them. Best you slip back alone. Get Harrah to hide you.”\n“PIL... Ul start the search for the traitor as soon as | get back,” she said. She peered into her brother’s face, sharing his painful knowledge that from this point on they would accumulate a store of differences. Never again would they be as one, sharing knowledge which no one else could understand.\n“I'll go to Jacurutu,” he said.\n“Fondak,” she said.\nHe nodded his agreement. Jacurutu/Fondak—they had to be the same place. It was the only way the legendary place could have been hidden. Smugglers had done it, of course. How easy for them to convert one label into another, acting under the cover of the unspoken convention by which they were allowed to exist. The ruling family of a planet must always have a back door for escape in extremis. And a small Share in smuggling profits kept the channels open. In Fondak/Jacurutu, the smugglers had taken over a completely operative sietch untroubled by a resident population. And they had hidden Jacurutu right out in the open, secure in the taboo which kept Fremen from it.\n“No Fremen will think to search for me in such a place,” he said. “They'll inquire among the smugglers, of course, but...”\n“We'll do as we agreed,” she said. “It’s just...”\n“I know.” Hearing his own voice, Leto realized they were drawing out these last moments of sameness. A wry grin touched his mouth, adding years to his appearance. Ghanima realized she was seeing him through a veil of time, looking at an older Leto. Tears burned her eyes.\n“You needn’t give water to the dead just yet,” he said, brushing a finger against the dampness on her cheeks. “IIl go out far enough that no one will hear, and l'Il calla worm.” He indicated the collapsed Maker hooks strapped to the outside of his Fremkit. “l'II be at Jacurutu before dawn two days from now.”\n“Ride swiftly, my old friend,” she whispered.\n“I’ll come back to you, my only friend,” he said. “Remember to be careful at the qanat.”\n“Choose a good worm,” she said, giving him the Fremen words of parting. Her left hand extinguished the glowglobe, and the nightseal rustled as she pulled it aside, folded it and tucked it into her kit. She felt him go, hearing only the softest of sounds quickly fading into silence as he crept down the rocks into the desert.\nGhanima steeled herself then for what she had to do. Leto must be dead to her. She had to make herself believe it. There could be no Jacurutu in her mind, no brother out there seeking a place lost in Fremen mythology. From this point onward she could not think of Leto as alive. She must condition herself to react out of a total belief that her brother was dead, killed here by Laza tigers. Not many humans could fool a Truthsayer, but she knew that she could do it... might have to do it. The multi-lives she and Leto shared had taught them the way: a hypnotic process old in Sheba’s time, although she might be the only human alive who could recall Sheba as a reality. The deep compulsions had been designed with care and, for a long time after Leto had gone, Ghanima reworked her self- awareness, building the lonely sister, the surviving twin, until it was a believable totality. As she did this, she found the inner world becoming silent, blanked away from intrusion into her consciousness. It was a side effect she had not expected.\nIf only Leto could have lived to learn this, she thought, and she did not find the thought a paradox. Standing, she peered down at the desert where the tiger had taken Leto. There was a sound growing in the sand out there, a familiar sound to Fremen: the passage of a worm. Rare as they had become in these parts, a worm still came. Perhaps the first cat’s death throes. ... Yes, Leto had killed one cat before the other one got him. It was oddly symbolic that a worm should come. So deep was her compulsion that she saw\nthree dark spots far down on the sand: the two tigers and Leto. Then the worm came and there was only sand with its surface broken into new waves by the passage of Shai- Hulud. It had not been a very large worm... but large enough. And her compulsion did not permit her to see a Small figure riding on the ringed back.\nFighting her grief, Ghanima sealed her Fremkit, crept cautiously from her hiding place. Hand on her maula pistol, she scanned the area. No sign of a human with a transmitter. She worked her way up the rocks and across to the far side, creeping through moonshadows, waiting and waiting to be sure no assassin lurked in her path.\nAcross the open space she could see torches at Tabr, the wavering activity of a search. A dark patch moved across the sand toward The Attendant. She chose her path to run far to the north of the approaching party, went down to the sand and moved into the dune shadows. Careful to make her steps fall in a broken rhythm which would not attract a worm, she set out into the lonely distance which separated Tabr from the place where Leto had died. She would have to be careful at the qanat, she knew. Nothing must prevent her from telling how her brother had perished saving her from the tigers.\nGovernments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class—whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.\n—POLITICS AS REPEAT PHENOMENON: BENE GESSERIT TRAINING MANUAL\nfd hy does he make us this offer?” Farad’n asked. “That’s most essential.”\nHe and the Bashar Tyekanik stood in the lounge of Farad’n’s private quarters. Wensicia sat at one side on a low blue divan, almost as audience rather than participant. She knew her position and resented it, but Farad’n had undergone a terrifying change since that morning when she'd revealed their plots to him.\nIt was late afternoon at Corrino Castle and the low light accented the quiet comfort of this lounge—a room lined with actual books reproduced in plastino, with shelves revealing a horde of player spools, data blocks, shigawire reels, mnemonic amplifiers. There were signs all around that this room was much used—worn places on the books, bright metal on the amplifiers, frayed corners on the data blocks. There was only the one divan, but many chairs—all of them sensiform floaters designed for unobtrusive comfort.\nFarad’n stood with his back to a window. He wore a plain Sardaukar uniform in grey and black with only the golden lion-claw symbols on the wings of his collar as decoration. He had chosen to receive the Bashar and his mother in this room, hoping to create an atmosphere of more relaxed communication than could be achieved in a more formal\nsetting. But Tyekanik’s constant “My Lord this” and “My Lady that” kept them at a distance.\n“My Lord, | don’t think he’d make this offer were he unable to deliver,” Tyekanik said.\n“Of course not!” Wensicia intruded.\nFarad’n merely glanced at his mother to silence her, asked: “We've put no pressure on Idaho, made no attempt to seek delivery on The Preacher’s promise?”\n“None,” Tyekanik said.\n“Then why does Duncan Idaho, noted all of his life for his fanatic loyalty to the Atreides, offer now to deliver the Lady Jessica into our hands?”\n“These rumors of trouble on Arrakis .. .” Wensicia ventured.\n“Unconfirmed,” Farad’n said. “Is it possible that The Preacher has precipitated this?”\n“Possible,” Tyekanik said, “but I fail to see a motive.”\n“He speaks of seeking asylum for her,” Farad’n said. “That might follow if those rumors...”\n“Precisely,” his mother said.\n“Or it could be a ruse of some sort,” Tyekanik said.\n“We can make several assumptions and explore them,” Farad’n said. “What if Idaho has fallen into disfavor with his Lady Alia?”\n“That might explain matters,” Wensicia said, “but he—”\n“No word yet from the smugglers?” Farad’n interrupted. “Why can’t we—”\n“Transmission is always slow in this season,” Tyekanik said, “and the needs of security .. .”\n“Yes, of course, but still...” Farad’n shook his head. “I don’t like our assumption.”\n“Don’t be too quick to abandon it,” Wensicia said. “All of those stories about Alia and that Priest, whatever his name Soe ete “Javid,” Farad’n said. “But the man’s obviously—”\n“He’s been a valuable source of information for us,” Wensicia said.\n“I was about to say that he’s obviously a double agent,” Farad’n said. “How could he indict himself in this? He’s not to be trusted. There are", " if Idaho has fallen into disfavor with his Lady Alia?”\n“That might explain matters,” Wensicia said, “but he—”\n“No word yet from the smugglers?” Farad’n interrupted. “Why can’t we—”\n“Transmission is always slow in this season,” Tyekanik said, “and the needs of security .. .”\n“Yes, of course, but still...” Farad’n shook his head. “I don’t like our assumption.”\n“Don’t be too quick to abandon it,” Wensicia said. “All of those stories about Alia and that Priest, whatever his name Soe ete “Javid,” Farad’n said. “But the man’s obviously—”\n“He’s been a valuable source of information for us,” Wensicia said.\n“I was about to say that he’s obviously a double agent,” Farad’n said. “How could he indict himself in this? He’s not to be trusted. There are too many signs...”\n“I fail to see them,” she said.\nHe was suddenly angry with her denseness. “Take my word for it, mother! The signs are there; l'Il explain later.”\n“I’m afraid | must agree,” Tyekanik said.\nWensicia lapsed into hurt silence. How dared they push her out of Council like this? As though she were some light- headed fancy woman with no—\n“We mustn't forget that Idaho was once a ghola,” Farad’n said. “The Tleilaxu .. .” He glanced sidelong at Tyekanik.\n“That avenue will be explored,” Tyekanik said. He found himself admiring the way Farad’n’s mind worked: alert, questing, sharp. Yes, the Tleilaxu, in restoring life to Idaho, might have planted a powerful barb in him for their own use.\n“But | fail to apprehend a Tleilaxu motive,” Farad’n said.\n“An investment in our fortunes,” Tyekanik said. “A small insurance for future favors?”\n“Large investment, I'd call it,” Farad’n said.\n“Dangerous,” Wensicia said.\nFarad’n had to agree with her. The Lady Jessica’s Capabilities were notorious in the Empire. After all, she’d been the one who'd trained Muad’Dib.\n“If it became known that we hold her,” Farad’n said.\n“Yes, that’d be a two-edged sword,” Tyekanik said. “But it need not be known.”\n“Let us assume,” Farad’n said, “that we accept this offer. What’s her value? Can we exchange her for something of greater importance?”\n“Not openly,” Wensicia said.\n“Of course not!” He peered expectantly at Tyekanik.\n“That remains to be seen,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n nodded. “Yes. | think if we accept, we should consider the Lady Jessica as money banked for indeterminate use. After all, wealth doesn’t necessarily have to be spent on any particular thing. It’s just... potentially useful.”\n“She'd be a very dangerous captive,” Tyekanik said.\n“There is that to consider, indeed,” Farad’n said. “I’m told that her Bene Gesserit Ways permit her to manipulate a person just by the subtle employment of her voice.”\n“Or her body,” Wensicia said. “Irulan once divulged to me some of the things she’d learned. She was showing off at the time, and | saw no demonstrations. Still the evidence is pretty conclusive that Bene Gesserits have their ways of achieving their ends.”\n“Were you suggesting,” Farad’n asked, “that she might seduce me?”\nWensicia merely shrugged.\n“I’d say she’s a little old for that, wouldn’t you?” Farad’n asked.\n“With a Bene Gesserit, nothing’s certain,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n experienced a shiver of excitement tinged with fear. Playing this game to restore House of Corrino’s high seat of power both attracted and repelled him. How attractive it remained, the urge to retire from this game into his preferred pursuits—historical research and learning the manifest duties for ruling here on Salusa Secundus. The restoration of his Sardaukar forces was a task in itself... and for that job, Tyek was still a good tool. One planet was, after all, an enormous responsibility. But the Empire was an even greater responsibility, far more attractive as an instrument of power. And the more he read about Muad’Dib/Paul Atreides, the more fascinated Farad’n became with the uses of power. As titular head of House Corrino, heir of Shaddam IV, what a great achievement it would be to restore his line to the Lion Throne. He wanted that! He wanted it. Farad’n had found that, by repeating this\nenticing litany to himself several times, he could overcome momentary doubts.\nTyekanik was speaking: “...and of course, the Bene Gesserit teach that peace encourages aggressions, thus igniting war. The paradox of—”\n“How did we get on this subject?” Farad’n asked, bringing his attention back from the arena of speculation.\n“Why,” Wensicia said sweetly, having noted the wool- gathering expression on her son’s face, “I merely asked if Tyek was familiar with the driving philosophy behind the Sisterhood.”\n“Philosophy should be approached with irreverence,” Farad’n said, turning to face Tyekanik. “In regard to Idaho’s offer, | think we should inquire further. When we think we know something, that’s precisely the moment when we should look deeper into the thing.”\n“It will be done,” Tyekanik said. He liked this cautious streak in Farad’n, but hoped it did not extend to those military decisions which required speed and precision.\nWith seeming irrelevancy, Farad’n asked: “Do you know what | find most interesting about the history of Arrakis? It was the custom in primitive times for Fremen to kill on sight anyone not clad in a stillsuit with its easily visible and characteristic hood.”\n“What is your fascination with the stillsuit?” Tyekanik asked.\n“So you've noticed, eh?”\n“How could we not notice?” Wensicia asked.\nFarad’n sent an irritated glance at his mother. Why did She interrupt like that? He returned his attention to Tyekanik.\n“The stillsuit is the key to that planet’s character, Tyek. It’s the hallmark of Dune. People tend to focus on the physical characteristics: the stillsuit conserves body moisture, recycles it, and makes it possible to exist on such a planet. You know, the Fremen custom was to have one\nstillsuit for each member of a family, except for food gatherers. They had spares. But please note, both of you—” He moved to include his mother in this. “—how garments which appear to be stillsuits, but really aren’t, have become high fashion throughout the Empire. It’s such a dominant characteristic for humans to copy the conqueror!”\n“Do you really find such information valuable?” Tyekanik asked, his tone puzzled.\n“Tyek, Tyvek—without such information, one cannot govern. | said the stillsuit was the key to their character and it is! It’s a conservative thing. The mistakes they make will be conservative mistakes.”\nTyekanik glanced at Wensicia, who was staring at her son with a worried frown. This characteristic of Farad’n’s both attracted and worried the Bashar. It was so unlike old Shaddam. Now, there had been an essential Sardaukar: a military killer with few inhibitions. But Shaddam had fallen to the Atreides under that damnable Paul. Indeed, what he read of Paul Atreides revealed just such characteristics as Farad’n now displayed. It was possible that Farad’n might hesitate less than the Atreides over brutal necessities, but that was his Sardaukar training.\n“Many have governed without using this kind of information,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n merely stared at him for a moment. Then: “Governed and failed.”\nTyekanik’s mouth drew into a stiff line at this obvious allusion to Shaddam’s failure. That had been a Sardaukar failure, too, and no Sardaukar could recall it easily.\nHaving made his point, Farad’n said: “You see, Tyek, the influence of a planet upon the mass unconscious of its inhabitants has never been fully appreciated. To defeat the Atreides, we must understand not only Caladan but Arrakis: one planet soft and the other a training ground for hard decisions. That was a unique event, that marriage of\nAtreides and Fremen. We must know how it worked or we won't be able to match it, let alone defeat it.”\n“What does this have to do with Idaho’s offer?” Wensicia demanded.\nFarad’n glanced pityingly down at his mother. “We begin their defeat by the kinds of stress we introduce into their society. That’s a very powerful tool: stress. And the lack of it is important, too. Did you not mark how the Atreides helped things grow soft and easy here?”\nTyekanik allowed himself a curt nod of agreement. That was a good point. The Sardaukar could not be permitted to grow too soft. This offer from Idaho still bothered him, though. He said: “Perhaps it’d be best to reject the offer.”\n“Not yet,” Wensicia said. “We’ve a spectrum of choices open to us. Our task is to identify as much of the spectrum as we can. My son is right: we need more information.”\nFarad’n stared at her, measuring her intent as well as the surface meaning of her words. “But will we know when we’ve passed the point of no alternate choice?” he asked.\nA sour chuckle came from Tyekanik. “If you ask me, we’re long past the point of no return.”\nFarad’n tipped his head back to laugh aloud. “But we still have alternate choices, Tyek! When we come to the end of our rope, that’s an important place to recognize!”\nIn this age when the means of human transport include devices which can span the deeps of space in transtime, and other devices which can carry men swiftly over virtually impassable planetary surfaces, it seems odd to think of attempting long journeys afoot. Yet this remains a primary means of travel on Arrakis, a fact attributed partly to preference and partly to the brutal treatment which this planet reserves for anything mechanical. In the strictures of Arrakis, human flesh remains the most durable and reliable resource for the Hajj. Perhaps it is the implicit awareness of this fact which makes Arrakis the ultimate mirror of the soul.\n—HANDBOOK OF THE HAJJ\nlowly, cautiously, Ghanima made her way back to Tabr,\nholding herself to the deepest shadows of the dunes, crouching in stillness as the search party passed to the south of her. Terrible awareness gripped her: the worm which had taken the tigers and Leto’s body, the dangers ahead. He was gone; her twin was gone. She put aside all tears and nurtured her rage. In this, she was pure Fremen. And she knew this, reveling in it.\nShe understood what was said about Fremen. They were not supposed to have a conscience, having lost it ina burning for revenge against those who had driven them from planet to planet in the long wandering. That was foolishness, of course.

Terrible awareness gripped her: the worm which had taken the tigers and Leto’s body, the dangers ahead. He was gone; her twin was gone. She put aside all tears and nurtured her rage. In this, she was pure Fremen. And she knew this, reveling in it.\nShe understood what was said about Fremen. They were not supposed to have a conscience, having lost it ina burning for revenge against those who had driven them from planet to planet in the long wandering. That was foolishness, of course. Only the rawest primitive had no conscience. Fremen possessed a highly evolved conscience which centered on their own welfare as a people. It was only to outsiders that they seemed brutish—just as outsiders appeared brutish to Fremen. Every Fremen knew very well that he could do a brutal thing and feel no guilt. Fremen did not feel guilt for the same things that aroused such feelings in others. Their rituals provided a freedom from guilts which might otherwise have destroyed them. They knew in their\ndeepest awareness that any transgression could be ascribed, at least in part, to well recognized extenuating circumstances: “the failure of authority,” or “a natural bad tendency” shared by all humans, or to “bad luck,” which any sentient creature should be able to identify as a collision between mortal flesh and the outer chaos of the universe.\nIn this context Ghanima felt herself to be the pure Fremen, a carefully prepared extension of tribal brutality. She needed only a target—and that, obviously, was House Corrino. She longed to see Farad’n’s blood spilled on the ground at her feet.\nNo enemy awaited her at the qanat. Even the search parties had gone elsewhere. She crossed the water on an earth bridge, crept through tall grass toward the covert exit of the sietch. Abruptly light flared ahead of her and Ghanima threw herself flat on the ground. She peered out through stalks of giant alfalfa. A woman had entered the covert passage from the outside, and someone had remembered to prepare that passage in the way any sietch entrance should be prepared. In troubled times, one greeted anyone entering the sietch with bright light, temporarily blinding the newcomer and giving guards time to decide. But such a greeting was never meant to be broadcast out over the desert. The light visible here meant the outer seals had been left aside.\nGhanima felt a tug of bitterness at this betrayal of sietch security: this flowing light. The ways of the lace-shirt Fremen were to be found everywhere!\nThe light continued to throw its fan over the ground at the cliff base. A young girl ran out of the orchard’s darkness into the light, something fearful about her movements. Ghanima could see the bright circle of a glowglobe within the passage, a halo of insects around it. The light illuminated two dark shadows in the passage: a man and the girl. They were holding hands as they stared into each other’s eyes.\nGhanima sensed something wrong about the man and woman there. They were not just two lovers stealing a moment from the search. The light was suspended above and beyond them in the passage. The two talked against a glowing arch, throwing their shadows into the outer night where anyone could be a watcher of their movements. Now and again the man would free a hand. The hand would come gesturing into the light, a sharp and furtive movement which, once completed, returned to the shadows.\nLonely sounds of night creatures filled the darkness around Ghanima, but she screened out such distractions.\nWhat was it about those two?\nThe man’s motions were so static, so careful.\nHe turned. Reflection from the woman ’s robe illuminated him, exposing a raw red face with a large blotchy nose. Ghanima drew in a deep, silent breath of recognition. Palimbasha! He was a grandson of a Naib whose sons had fallen in Atreides service. The face—and another thing revealed by the open swinging of his robe as he turned— drew for Ghanima a complete picture. He wore a belt beneath the robe, and attached to the belt was a box which glistened with keys and dials. It was an instrument of the Tleilaxu or the Ixians for certain. And it had to be the transmitter which had released the tigers. Palimbasha. This meant that another Naibate family had gone over to House Corrino.\nWho was the woman, then? No matter. She was someone being used by Palimbasha.\nUnbidden, a Bene Gesserit thought came into Ghanima’s mind: Each planet has its own period, and each life likewise. She recalled Palimbasha well, watching him there with that woman, seeing the transmitter, the furtive movements.\nPalimbasha taught in the sietch school. Mathematics. The man was a mathematical boor. He had attempted to explain Muad’Dib through mathematics until censured by the Priesthood. He was a mind-slaver and his enslaving process\ncould be understood with extreme simplicity: he transferred technical knowledge without a transfer of values.\n| should’ve suspected him earlier, she thought. The signs were all there.\nThen, with an acid tightening of her stomach: He killed my brother!\nShe forced herself to calmness. Palimbasha would kill her, too, if she tried to pass him there in the covert passage. Now she understood the reason for this un-Fremen display of light, this betrayal of the hidden entrance. They were watching by that light to see if either of their victims had escaped. It must be a terrible time of waiting for them, not knowing. And now that Ghanima had seen the transmitter, she could explain certain of the hand motions. Palimbasha was depressing one of the transmitter’s keys frequently, an angry gesture.\nThe presence of this pair said much to Ghanima. Likely every way into the sietch carried a similar watcher in its depths.\nShe scratched her nose where dust tickled it. Her wounded leg still throbbed and the knife arm ached when it didn’t burn. The fingers remained numb. Should it come to a knife, she would have to use the blade in her left hand.\nGhanima thought of using the maula pistol, but its characteristic sound would be sure to attract unwanted attention. Some other way would have to be found.\nPalimbasha turned away from the entrance once more. He was a dark object against the light. The woman turned her attention to the outer night while she talked. There was a trained alertness about the woman, a sense that she knew how to look into the shadows, using the edges of her eyes. She was more than just a useful tool, then. She was part of the deeper conspiracy.\nGhanima recalled now that Palimbasha aspired to be a Kaymakam, a political governor under the Regency. He would be part of a larger plan, that was clear. There would\nbe many others with him. Even here in Tabr. Ghanima examined the edges of the problem thus exposed, probed into it. If she could take one of these guardians alive, many others would be forfeit.\nThe whiffle of a small animal drinking at the qanat behind her caught Ghanima’s awareness. Natural sounds and natural things. Her memory searched through a strange silent barrier in her mind, found a priestess of Jowf captured in Assyria by Sennacherib. The memories of that priestess told Ghanima what would have to be done here. Palimbasha and his woman there were mere children, wayward and dangerous. They knew nothing of Jowf, knew not even the name of the planet where Sennacherib and the priestess had faded into dust. The thing which was about to happen to the pair of conspirators, if it were explained to them, could only be explained in terms of beginning here.\nAnd ending here.\nRolling onto her side, Ghanima freed her Fremkit, slipped the sandsnorkel from its bindings. She uncapped the sandsnorkel, removed the long filter within it. Now she had an open tube. She selected a needle from the repair pack, unsheathed her crysknife, and inserted the needle into the poison hollow at the knife’s tip, that place where once a sandworm’s nerve had fitted. Her injured arm made the work difficult. She moved carefully and slowly, handling the poisoned needle with caution while she took a wad of spice- fiber from its chamber in the kit. The needle’s shank fitted tightly into the fiber wad, forming a missile which went tightly into the tube of the sandsnorkel.\nHolding the weapon flat, Ghanima wormed her way closer to the light, moving slowly to cause minimal disturbance in the alfalfa. As she moved, she studied the insects around the light. Yes, there were piume flies in that fluttering mob. They were notorious biters of human flesh. The poisoned dart might go unnoticed, swatted aside as a biting fly. A\ndecision remained: Which one of those two to take—the man or the woman!\nMuriz. The name came unbidden into Ghanima’s mind. That was the woman’s name. It recalled things said about her. She was one of those who fluttered around Palimbasha as the insects fluttered around the light. She was easily swayed, a weak one.\nVery well. Palimbasha had chosen the wrong companion for this night.\nGhanima put the tube to her mouth and, with the memory of the priestess of Jowf clearly in her awareness, she sighted carefully, expelled her breath in one strong surge.\nPalimbasha batted at his cheek, drew away a hand with a speck of blood on it. The needle was nowhere to be seen, flicked away by the motion of his own hand.\nThe woman said something soothing and Palimbasha laughed. As he laughed, his legs began to give away beneath him. He sagged against the woman, who tried to support him. She was still staggering with the dead weight when Ghanima came up beside her and pressed the point of an unsheathed crysknife against her waist.\nIn a conversational tone, Ghanima said: “Make no sudden moves, Muriz. My knife is poisoned. You may let go of Palimbasha now. He is dead.”\nIn all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words. From witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same. A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power-words as actual things, to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe. In the maintenance of such a power structure, certain symbols are kept out of the reach of common understanding— symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity. Symbol-secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub-languages, each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power. With this insight into a power process, our Imperial Security Force must be ever alert to the formation of sub-languages.\n—LECTURE TO THE ARRAKEEN WAR COLLEGE BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n44] tis perhaps unnecessary to tell you,” Farad’n said, “but\nto avoid any errors l'Il announce that a mute has been stationed with orders to kill you both should | show signs of succumbing to witchery.”\nHe did not expect to see any effect from these words.
