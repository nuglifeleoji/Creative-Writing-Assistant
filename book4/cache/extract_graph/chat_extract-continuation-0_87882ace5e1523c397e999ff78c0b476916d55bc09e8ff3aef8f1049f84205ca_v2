\n　　现在，夏令营的工作早已结束，他不会再去找活干，因此一天很闲。晓霞马上也要动身，忙着收拾东西，和要好的同学告别聚餐，最近也不能时时和他在一起。他只好一个人躺在窑洞里读她送来的书。此刻，他内心骚动不安，就象一个即将进入火线的士兵。 \n　　虽然夏令营结束了，润叶姐给武惠良打了招呼，仍然让他住在地委的那孔窑洞里。听说他要到铜城去当矿工，润叶姐也很为他高兴，还给他送来了一条毛巾被，并一再嘱咐让他到煤矿上注意安全……这一天，他仍然躺在窑洞里心烦意乱地看书。本来他想出去走动一下，但外面热浪扑面，出去是一身大汗；他舍不得把自己新买的短袖衬衫弄脏。他发现，从南关柴油机厂结束揽工后，他已经习惯了眼下这种较为舒适的生活。唉，人的惰性啊！ \n　　不过，他同时也原谅自己的懒散——他牛马般干了那么长时间活，有权得放纵几天了！ \n　　他正在看书，金波突然从门里闯进来。少平看见，他的朋友的脸上带着一种异样的情绪。 \n　　金波进得门来，先没说话，伸出胳膊就把他紧紧地抱住了！ \n　　“怎么啦？”他紧张地问。 \n　　“兰香和金秀都考上大学了！”金波说着，两团泪水就从他那双漂亮的大眼睛里涌了出来。 \n　　少平一下子呆住了。当反应过来的时候，他自己又伸开双臂，把金波紧紧地抱住了！ \n　　两个好朋友兴奋和激动得在脚地上象小孩一样又笑又闹！ \n　　“你什么时候知道的？她们被哪个大学录取了？”少平揩着眼角的泪水问金波。 \n　　“兰香考上了北方工业大学天体物理专业。金秀考进了省医学院……北方工大是全国重点大学！”金波从衣袋里摸出一封信，“这是他们给咱俩的信！” \n　　少平急切地打开信，飞快浏览了一遍。 \n　　“九月一日就开学！那她们这两天就要从家里动身！”少平一边看信，一边说。 \n　　“我马上就开车回去接她们。中午一吃饭就走！明天到包头，后天返回时正好能把她们捎到黄原来！” \n　　金波不敢再耽误时间，报完讯后马上就走……少平心情难以平静，一个人在窑洞的脚地上转着圈走了好长时间。生活的变化是如此的急速，以致使事变中的人们都反应不过来——一切都叫人眼花缭乱！ \n　　孙少平强迫自己平静下来，冷静下来；因为潜意识提醒他，还有一些具体事需要办理，而时间已经很紧迫了！他坐\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
