It is described as a clean and tidy structure located in a village, contrasting sharply with the narrator's own shelter, which suggests a sense of longing or aspiration for a more stable and comforting environment. This farmhouse is not only a physical location but also a place of contemplation for the narrator, who reflects on their circumstances and plans to communicate with an elderly man, indicating its role as a site of personal introspection and potential resolution.\n\nThe farmhouse is strategically positioned near the protagonist's hiding place, offering both a vantage point for observation and a possible refuge. However, it also carries darker connotations, as it is depicted as being engulfed in flames and ultimately destroyed, symbolizing the release of vengeance and anger. This duality highlights the farmhouse as a site of conflict and emotional turmoil.\n\nAdditionally, the farmhouse is identified as the residence of 德拉赛 (Delaise), where travelers seek rest, further emphasizing its role as a communal space. It is characterized as a rural dwelling typically associated with agricultural activities, yet it also evokes fear among residents due to the presence of monsters, adding an element of danger and unease to its pastoral image.\n\nThe structure is described as being nestled among green trees, enhancing the natural beauty of the landscape, which contrasts with the chaos that unfolds within its walls. The farmhouse is pivotal to the unfolding drama, serving as the backdrop for conflicts between characters, particularly between 费利克斯 (Felix) and 德拉赛, with Felix expressing a desire to leave this place behind.\n\nMoreover, the farmhouse is where 贾斯汀 (Justin) spends the night while searching for 威廉 (William), waiting for dawn to break. This aspect underscores the farmhouse's role as a temporary sanctuary amidst uncertainty and quest.\n\nIn summary, the \"\"农舍\"\" is a multifaceted entity within the narrative, representing both a physical space of refuge and a symbolic site of conflict, introspection, and emotional release. Its contrasting characteristics—being a place of beauty and safety while also embodying fear and destruction—make it a central element in the story, influencing the actions and emotions of the characters who interact with it.\",22\r\n671,仇恨,仇恨是叙述者内心深处的一种强烈情感，这种情感驱使他采取极端行为以发泄内心的愤怒和不满。它不仅影响了叙述者的行为，还深刻改变了他的内心世界，使他无法再回到曾经的美好憧憬。与此同时，仇恨也被描绘为一种怪物内心的情感，这种情感取代了他曾经的理想和希望，成为他存在的主导力量。通过这些描述，可以看出仇恨不仅是个人情感的体现，更是对内心深处美好愿望的扭曲和摧毁。仇恨的存在使得个体在情感上陷入孤独和绝望，最终导致极端行为的产生。,2\r\n525,年轻女子,\"The young woman is described as having a dignified demeanor, wearing simple clothing, and carrying a water bucket, indicating her role in the rural setting.\",3\r\n526,窝棚,\"The entity \"\"窝棚\"\" refers to a makeshift shelter constructed from stones and wood, serving as a temporary refuge for the protagonist, 费利克斯.
