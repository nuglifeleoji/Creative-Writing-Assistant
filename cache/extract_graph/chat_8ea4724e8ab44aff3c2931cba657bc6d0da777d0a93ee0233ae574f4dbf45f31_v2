He met his mother’s cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.\nStilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: “When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.”\nJessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made—it served a purpose now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw. Admiration, yes, and fear...and in some—loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.\nPaul looked at his mother. “You know what it was,” he said.\nShe heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her glance across the troop, said: “Paul has never before killed a man with a naked blade.”\nStilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.\n“I wasn’t playing with him,” Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother, straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis’ blood on the cavern floor. “I did not want to kill him.”\nJessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering awareness spread through the troop.\n“That’s why y’ asked him to yield,” Stilgar said. “| see. Our ways are different, but you'll see the sense in them. | thought we’d admitted a scorpion into our midst.” He hesitated, then: “And | shall not call you lad the more.”\nA voice from the troop called out: “Needs a naming, Stil.”\nStilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. “I see strength in you...like the strength beneath a pillar.”\nAgain he paused, then: “You shall be known among us as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume...Usul.”\nMurmuring went through the troop: “Good choice, that...strong...bring us luck.” And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.\n“Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.\n“How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?” Paul asked, remembering the pop-hop of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one hand.\nA chuckle sounded through the troop.\n“We call that one muad’dib,” Stilgar said.\nJessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen would accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear of her son and for him.\nPaul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind... yet...there were differences. He could see himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.\nAnd again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib. That must not happen, he told himself.\n“Is that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked.\n“Lam an Atreides,” Paul whispered, and then louder: “It’s not right that | give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could | be known among you as Paul-Muad’Dib?”\n“You are Paul-Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.\nAnd Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine. | did a different thing.\nBut he felt that the abyss remained all around him.\nAgain a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man: “Wisdom with strength...Couldn’t ask more...It’s the legend for sure...Lisan al-Gaib...Lisan al-Gaib....”\n“I will tell you a thing about your new name,” Stilgar said. “The choice pleases us. Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad’Dib creates his own water. Muad’Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad’Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad’Dib we call ‘instructor-of-boys.’ That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul- Muad’Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you.”\nStilgar touched Paul’s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, “Usul.”\nAs Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul, repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone: “Usul...Usul...Usul.” Already, he could place some of them by name. And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.\nPresently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: “Now, you are of the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother.” His face hardened, and he spoke with command in his voice. “And now, Paul-Muad’Dib, tighten up that stillsuit.” He glanced at Chani. “Chani! Paul-Muad’Dib’s nose plugs are as poor a fit I’ve ever seen! | thought | ordered you to see after him!”\n“I hadn’t the makings, Stil,” she said. “There’s Jamis’, of course, but—”\n“Enough of that!”\n“Then l'Il share one of mine,” she said. “I can make do with one until—”\n“You will not,” Stilgar said. “I know there are Spares among us. Where are the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of savages?”\nHands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar selected four, handed them to Chani. “Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina.”\nA voice lifted from the back of the troop: “What of the water, Stil? What of the literjons in their pack?”\n“I know your need, Farok,” Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.\n“Broach one for those that need it,” Stilgar said. “Watermaster...where is a watermaster? Ah,\nShimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed. The necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees.”\n“What is the repayment at field rates?” Jessica asked.\n“Ten for one,” Stilgar said.\n“But—”\n“It’s a wise rule as you'll come to see,” Stilgar said.\nA rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.\nStilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. “As to Jamis,” he said, “I order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his tahaddi-challenge. | invoke the rite...at sunset when the dark shall cover him.”\nPaul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss...blind time. There was no past occupying the future in his mind... except...except...he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving...somewhere ahead... still see the jihad’s bloody swords and fanatic legions.\nIt will not be, he told himself. / cannot let it be.\nGod created Arrakis to train the faithful.\n—FROM “THE WISDOM OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| n the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of his watchmen.\nThe great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave’s opening. She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in the dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had— the ability to sense even the slightest change in the air’S moisture.\nHow they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened! Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:\n“Ima trava okolo! | korenja okolo!”\nJessica translated silently: These are ashes! And these are roots!\nThe funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.\nShe looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky. Night was beginning\nto utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the dunes.\nYet the heat persisted.\nHeat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times.\nThirst.\nShe could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks...and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath’s moisture.\nThe suit itself was a sweatbox.\n“Your suit will be more comfortable when you've adjusted to a lower water content in your body,” Stilgar had said.\nShe knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind. No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.\nAnd that was a more subtle and profound matter.\nShe heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave’s depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.\nThere’s another thing, Jessica thought. Pau/ must be cautioned about their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine, yes, but not as wife.\nThen she wondered at herself, thinking: Have / been infected with his schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. / can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet...| was more than concubine.\n“Mother.”\nPaul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.\n“Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?”\nJessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. “I think so.”\n“Chani showed me...because I’m Supposed to see it and give my...permission for the weighing of the water.”\nJessica looked at Chani\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8ea4724e8ab44aff3c2931cba657bc6d0da777d0a93ee0233ae574f4dbf45f31_v2"}
