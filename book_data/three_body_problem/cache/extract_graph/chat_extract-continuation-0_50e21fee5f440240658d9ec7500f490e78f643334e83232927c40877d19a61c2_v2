美丽女孩双手托起晶亮的金属球,让人联想到身材苗条的艺术体操运动员。她又露出那动人的笑。用悦耳的声音说：“各位警官．我们手里拿着的是三枚原子弹，每枚当量一千五百吨级，不算大，我们喜欢小玩艺儿．这是起爆开关。”\n     大厅的一切顿时凝固了，唯一在动的是史强。他把倒握的枪插回左腋下的枪套．神态自若地拍拍手。\n     “我们的要求很简单：让统帅走．然后咱们一起玩什么都行。”女孩接着说．样子有些娇嗔。\n     “我和同志们在一起。”叶文洁平静地说。\n     “能证实她说的吗?”史强低声问旁边一位显然是爆炸物专家的军官。\n     那位军官将一只塑料袋扔到那三个拿球的人跟前，袋中装着一把弹簧秤。一名拿金属球的三体战士拾起塑料袋，取出弹簧秤后将球装进袋子，挂到弹簧秤上．举起来晃了晃，然后把球取出来扔到地上。女孩儿哈哈一笑，这边的爆炸物专家也轻蔑地笑笑。另一个拿球的人也照洋称了球，然后也将球扔了。女孩又笑了一声．接过塑料袋将球装了进去，挂到弹簧秤上，标尺哗地一下直落到底。\n     爆炸物专家脸上的笑容凝固了，低声对史强说：“这个是了。”\n     史强仍不动声色。\n     “至少可以肯定里面装有重元素裂变材料，至于引爆系统行不行还不清楚。”爆炸物专家说。\n     士兵们枪上电筒的光柱集中在那个拿核弹的女孩儿身上，这个艳丽的死亡之花手捧着一千五百吨TNT．灿烂地笑着．仿佛是在舞台聚光灯下迎接着掌声和赞美。\n     “有一个办法：向那个球射击。”爆炸物专家在大史耳边低声说。\n     “不会引爆?”\n     “只会引爆外围的常规炸药，但会将炸药打散．无法对中心核炸药产生精确向心压缩，肯定不会发生核爆炸。”\n     大史盯着核弹女孩儿，不说话。\n     “要布置狙击手吗?”\n     大史几乎不为人察觉地摇摇头．  “没有合适位置,那小东西精得能捉鬼,狙击手的长家伙一瞄准她就会觉察.\n     说完,大史径直向前走去,拨开人群,站到中间的空地上.\n     “站住.”核弹女孩向大史抛了个媚眼警告道,右手拇指紧按在起爆开关上,指甲油在电筒光中闪亮着.\n     \"悠着点儿丫头,有件事你肯定想知道.”大史站在距女孩七八米远处,从衣袋中掏出一个信封\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
