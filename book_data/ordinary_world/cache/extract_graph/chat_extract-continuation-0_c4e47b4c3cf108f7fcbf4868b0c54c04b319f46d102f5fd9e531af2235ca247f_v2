\n　　这时候，孙少平也往往找借口离开运动场，旋磨着来到报栏前，和她一块看报，拉话。晓霞告诉他，她父亲说过，一个中学生就要开始养成每天看报的习惯，这样才能开阔眼界；一个有文化的人不知道国家和世界目前发生了些什么事，这是很可悲的…… \n　　这些话给少平留下了极深刻的印象。从此以后，每天下午，不管晓霞来不来，他也常主动来这报栏前看报纸了。而这个良好的习惯，以后不论在什么样的环境里，他都一直坚持了下来。 \n　　有一次他和晓霞一块看报纸的时候，晓霞指着一篇文章的署名说：“这家伙又胡说八道了！” \n　　少平一看，她手指的名字叫“初澜”。他大吃一惊。晓霞怎敢说这个人胡说八道呢？这个人常发表“重要文章”，班主任还组织大家学习呢！ \n　　“你怎敢这样说呢？”孙少平惊恐地问她。 \n　　晓霞笑了笑说：“我知道你不会去告我。这些人就是胡说八道！咱们国家现在叫这些人弄得一团糟！” \n　　“你怎知道呢？”少平问她。 \n　　“你难道看不见吗？现在农民连饭也吃不上，你是农村来的，你又不是不知道。再说，你看咱们学校整天不上课，一天就是搞运动，而这些人还喊叫个没完，说形势大好……形势年年大好，阶级敌人和资本主义倒好象越来越多了，整天就是搞这运动那运动，穷折腾个没完！反正咱们国家现在快叫这些人折腾完了……” \n　　“这是你的看法还是你爸给你说的？”少平又问她。“我爸也常发牢骚哩！不过，咱们自己又不是不长脑子？你常不想这些事？” \n　　“我……想得不多。”少平如实地说。 \n　　“我发现你这个人气质不错！农村来的许多学生气质太差劲，比如那个比我大三天的润生哥，一点头脑都没有！” \n　　气质？什么是气质？少平第一次听见有这么个词。他问她：“什么叫气质？” \n　　“气质嘛……”晓霞脸红了，显然她也说不清楚，就说：“反正我也不会确切解释，但我知道是什么意思。你的气质就是不错！”她又强调说。 \n　　孙少平虽然不明白这个词的意思，反正知道这是个好词。大概就是说性格或者个性比较好——当然不是老好人的好——可能恰恰和老好人相反的一种好？ \n　　“你还应该看《参考消息》！”晓霞又对他说。 \n　　“我听说有这种报纸，但又听说是内部的，看不上。”“我爸订一份，罢了我一星期给你拿一次。另外，我看你爱读书，但不要光看小说，还要看一点其它书，比如政治经济学和哲学。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
