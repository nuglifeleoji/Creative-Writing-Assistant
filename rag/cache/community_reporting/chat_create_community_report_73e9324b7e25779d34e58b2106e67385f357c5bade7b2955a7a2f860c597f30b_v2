Originally a disciplined army and ceremonial guard, they evolved into a multifaceted organization responsible for security, political enforcement, and religious rituals. Tasked with maintaining the **Golden Path**, they suppressed male aggression through structured indoctrination and participated in key ceremonies like **Siaynoq** and the **Great Sharing**, where they distributed spice wafers to symbolize unity under Leto’s reign.  \n\nClad in distinctive uniforms—green for trainees and white for senior members—the Fish Speakers combined martial prowess with priestly duties, acting as Leto’s personal guards, enforcers, and even secret agents. Their influence expanded across the Empire, overseeing communal events like the decadal **Royal Festival** and neutralizing threats, such as **Bene Tleilax** assassination attempts. Though primarily non-aggressive, their cyclical, ritualistic structure emphasized Leto’s philosophy of guiding humanity toward maturity.  \n\nUnder **Siona Atreides**, they became an elite force trained for independence, later shifting allegiance to **Duncan Idaho**. Historically linked to **Ix** and the **Bene Gesserit**, they were occasionally infiltrated by **Face Dancers**, yet their core remained devoted to Leto’s vision.
