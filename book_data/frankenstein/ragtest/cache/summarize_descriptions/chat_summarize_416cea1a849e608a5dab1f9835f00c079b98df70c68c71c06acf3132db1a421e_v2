The project was created by a team of six members, showcasing their collaborative efforts in game development. However, the program was allegedly leaked or stolen by the company \"无限企划\" (Mugen Kikaku), which later claimed it as their own flagship game. According to some accounts, the game was provided to the company by an individual named Kirihara (桐原), though the circumstances surrounding this transfer remain unclear. The incident has been described as a case of plagiarism, with the original creators accusing \"无限企划\" of appropriating their work without authorization. Despite the controversy, **SUBMARINE** remains recognized as a student-led project from North Osaka University, highlighting both its innovative origins and the disputed nature of its later commercialization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754879501, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 161}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
