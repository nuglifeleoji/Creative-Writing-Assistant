It serves as a primary route for the God Emperor and his entourage, connecting key locations such as the **Citadel**, **Festival City**, and **Tuono**. The road is marked by distinctive rock pillars and traverses a high artificial ridge, offering elevated viewpoints and symbolic prominence.  \n\nStretching eastward before turning south around the **Sareer**, the Royal Road includes a carved cut leading to a bridge across the **Idaho River**, where pivotal events, including the attack on **Leto**, have occurred. It also functions as a processional route through **Festival City**, often illuminated by afternoon sunlight during ceremonial occasions. The pathway atop the **Wall** underscores its strategic and ceremonial importance, reinforcing the God Emperor's control and the empire's grandeur.  \n\nThe road is frequently used by the God Emperor's cortege, particularly in his cart, which symbolizes his dominion. Its dual role—as both a practical thoroughfare and a stage for imperial pageantry—highlights its significance in governance, travel, and ritual within the empire.\",6\n1343,FESTIVAL CITY,\"**FESTIVAL CITY**  \n\nFestival City is a major urban center on Arrakis, constructed under the directive of the God Emperor Leto II. Designed as a hub for public ceremonies and gatherings, it serves as a focal point for the Royal Festival, where Leto’s entourage arrives amid large crowds and ceremonial chants. The city features a central plaza and tiered apartments with balconies, strategically arranged to facilitate public viewing of the God Emperor during festivities.  \n\nAs a central location for political and social events, Festival City hosts significant occasions such as betrothal announcements and elaborate performances, including those by Bene Tleilax Face Dancers. It also houses the Embassy Quarter, underscoring its importance as a diplomatic and cultural nexus. However, the city is not without conflict; it becomes a site of violence when Fish Speakers retaliate against Face Dancers following an assassination attempt on Leto.  \n\nAdditionally, Festival City is home to Fish Speaker schools, playing a key role in the upbringing and training of individuals like Siona. Its dual function as both a ceremonial stage and a military-educational center reflects Leto’s broader vision of control and spectacle. In essence, Festival City embodies the grandeur, political intrigue, and rigid order of Leto’s empire, serving as a microcosm of his rule.\",9\n1351,EMBASSY QUARTER,\"The Embassy Quarter is a district in Festival City where foreign delegations reside\"\"\",1\n1389,CENTRAL PLAZA,\"The two-kilometer-wide central space in the Festival City where the God Emperor is displayed.\"\"\",1\n1313,FESTIVAL,\"The **FESTIVAL** is a significant decennial event held in the **Festival City's plaza**, where the **God Emperor** is ceremonially displayed to the public.

The Festival is also referenced in relation to **Kobat's return to Ix**, suggesting it holds broader historical or narrative importance, possibly as a marker of time or a catalyst for key events. Together, these descriptions portray the Festival as a rare, momentous gathering with deep symbolic meaning, intertwining themes of power, tradition, and cyclical renewal.  \n\nThe event's decennial nature underscores its rarity and significance, while its association with the God Emperor implies a connection to rulership, divinity, or centralized authority. The mention of Kobat's return further hints that the Festival may coincide with or influence major turning points in the world's lore.
