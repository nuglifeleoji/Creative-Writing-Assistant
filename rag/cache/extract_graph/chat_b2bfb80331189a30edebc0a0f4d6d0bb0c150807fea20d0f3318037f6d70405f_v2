But the Duncans believe that all languages are mine.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nor two full turns of days and nights, Siona failed to seal\nher face mask, losing precious water with every breath. It had taken the Fremen admonition to children before Siona remembered her father’s words. Leto had spoken to her finally on the cold third morning of their traverse when they stopped within a rock shadow on the windswept flat of the erg.\n“Guard every breath for it carries the warmth and moisture of your life,” he said.\nHe had known they would be three more days on the erg and three more nights beyond that before they reached water. Now, it was the fifth morning from the Little Citadel’s tower. They had entered shallow drifts of sand during the night—not dunes, but dunes could be glimpsed ahead of them and even the remnants of Habbanya Ridge were a thin, broken line in the distance if you knew where to look. Now, Siona took down the mouth flap of her stillsuit only to\nspeak clearly. And she spoke through black and bleeding lips.\nShe has the thirst of desperation, he thought, as he let his senses probe their surroundings. She will reach the moments of crisis soon. His senses told him that they were still alone here at the edge of the flat. Dawn lay only minutes behind them. The low light created barriers of dust reflection which twisted and lifted and dipped in the unceasing wind. His senses filtered out the wind that he might hear other things—Siona’s heaving breaths, the tumble of a small sandspill from the rocks beside them, his own gross body grating in the thin sand cover.\nSiona peeled her face mask aside but held it in her hand for quick restoration.\n“How much longer until we find water?” she asked.\n“Three nights.”\n“Is there a better direction to go?”\n“No.”\nShe had come to appreciate the Fremen economy with important information. She sipped greedily at a few drops in her catchpocket.\nLeto recognized the message of her movements— familiar gestures for Fremen in extremis. Siona was now fully aware of a common experience among her ancestors— patiyeh, the thirst at the edge of death.\nThe few drops in her catchpocket were gone. He heard her sucking air. She restored the mask and spoke ina muffled voice.\n“I won’t make it, will 1?”\nLeto looked into her eyes, seeing there the clarity of thought brought on by the nearness of death, a penetrating awareness seldom otherwise achieved. It amplified only that which was required for survival. Yes, she was well into the tedah riagrimi, the agony which opens the mind. Soon, she would have to make that ultimate decision which she yet believed she had already made. Leto knew by the signs that\nhe was required to treat Siona now with extreme courtesy. He would have to answer every question with candor for in every question lurked a judgment.\n“Will 1?” she insisted.\nThere was still a trace of hope in her desperation.\n“Nothing is certain,” he said.\nThis dropped her into despair.\nThat had not been Leto’s intention, but he knew that it often happened—an accurate, though ambiguous, answer was taken as confirmation of one’s deepest fears.\nShe sighed.\nHer mask-muffled voice probed at him once more. “You had some special intention for me in your breeding program.”\nIt was not a question.\n“All people have intentions,” he told her.\n“But you wanted my full agreement.”\n“That is true.”\n“How could you expect agreement when you know | hate everything about you? Be honest with me!”\n“The three legs of the agreement-tripod are desire, data and doubt. Accuracy and honesty have little to do with it.”\n“Please don’t argue with me. You know I’m dying.”\n“I respect you too much to argue with you.”\nHe lifted his front segments slightly then, probing the wind. It already was beginning to bring the day’s heat but there was too much moisture in it for his comfort. He was reminded that the more he ordered the weather controlled, the more there was that required control. Absolutes only brought him closer to vagaries.\n“You say you’re not arguing, but.. .”\n“Argument closes off the doors of the senses,” he said, lowering himself back to the surface. “It always masks violence. Continued too long, argument always leads to violence. | have no violent intentions toward you.”\n“What do you mean—desire, data and doubt?”\n“Desire brings the participants together. Data set the limits of their dialogue. Doubt frames the questions.”\nShe moved closer to stare directly into his face from less than a meter away.\nHow odd, he thought, that hatred could be mingled so completely with hope and fear and awe.\n“Could you save me?”\n“There is a way.”\nShe nodded and he knew she had leaped to the wrong conclusion.\n“You want to trade that for my agreement!” she accused.\n“No.”\n“If | pass your test...”\n“It is not my test.”\n“Whose?”\n“It derives from our common ancestors.”\nSiona sank to a sitting position on the cold rock and remained silent, not yet ready to ask for a resting place within the lip of his warm front segment. Leto thought he could hear the soft scream waiting in her throat. Now, her doubts were at work. She was beginning to wonder if he really could be fitted into her image of Ultimate Tyrant. She looked up at him with that terrible clarity he had identified in her.\n“What makes you do what you do?”\nThe question was well framed. He said: “My need to save the people.”\n“What people?”\n“My definition is much broader than that of anyone else— even of the Bene Gesserit, who think they have defined what it is to be human. | refer to the eternal thread of all humankind by whatever definition.”\n“You're trying to tell me...” Her mouth became too dry for speaking. She tried to accumulate saliva. He saw the movements within her face mask. Her question was obvious, though, and he did not wait.\n“Without me there would have been by now no people anywhere, none whatsoever. And the path to that extinction was more hideous than your wildest imaginings.”\n“Your supposed prescience,” she sneered.\n“The Golden Path still stands open,” he said.\n“| don’t trust you!”\n“Because we are not equals?”\n“Yes!”\n“But we're interdependent.”\n“What need have you for me?”\nAhhh, the cry of youth unsure of its niche. He felt the strength within the secret bonds of dependency and forced himself to be hard. Dependency fosters weakness!\n“You are the Golden Path,” he said.\n“Me?” It was barely a whisper.\n“You've read those journals you stole from me,” he said. “Tam in them, but where are you? Look at what | have created, Siona. And you, you can create nothing except yourself.”\n“Words, more tricky words!”\n“| do not suffer from being worshipped, Siona. | suffer from never being appreciated. Perhaps... No, | dare not hope for you.”\n“What’s the purpose of those journals?”\n“An Ixian machine records them. They are to be found on a faraway day. They will make people think.”\n“An Ixian machine? You defy the Jihad!”\n“There’s a lesson in that, too. What do such machines really do? They increase the number of things we can do without thinking. Things we do without thinking—there’s the real danger. Look at how long you walked across this desert without thinking about your face mask.”\n“You could have warned me!”\n“And increased your dependency.”\nShe stared at him a moment, then: “Why would you want me to command your Fish Speakers?”\n“You are an Atreides woman, resourceful and capable of independent thought. You can be truthful just for the sake of truth as you see it. You were bred and trained for command —which means freedom from dependence.”\nThe wind whirled dust and sand around them while she weighed his words. “And if | agree, you'll save me?”\n“No.”\nShe had been so sure of the opposite answer that it was several heartbeats before she translated that single word. In that time, the wind fell slightly, exposing a vista across the dune-scape to the remnants of Habbanya Ridge. The air was suddenly chilled with that cold which did as much to rob the flesh of moisture as did the hottest sunlight. Part of Leto’s awareness detected an oscillation in weather control.\n“No?” She was both puzzled and outraged.\n“I do not make bloody bargains with people | must trust.”\nShe shook her head slowly from side to side, but her gaze remained fixed on his face. “What will make you save me?”\n“Nothing will make me do it. Why do you think you could do to me what | will not do to you? That is not the way of interdependence.”\nHer shoulders slumped. “If | cannot bargain with you or force you...”\n“Then you must choose another path.”\nWhat a marvelous thing to observe the explosive growth of awareness, he thought. Siona’s expressive features hid nothing of it from him. She focused on his eyes and glared at him as though seeking to move completely into his thoughts. New strength entered her muffled voice.\n“You would have me know everything about you—even every weakness?”\n“Would you steal what | would give openly?”\nThe morning light was harsh on her face. “I promise you nothing!”\n“Nor do | require that.”\n“But you will give me... water if | ask?”\n“It is not just water.”\nShe nodded. “And | am Atreides.”\nThe Fish Speakers had not withheld the lesson of that special susceptibility in the Atreides genes. She knew where the spice originated and what it might do to her. The teachers in the Fish Speaker schools never failed him. And the gentle additions of melange in Siona’s dried food had done their work, too.\n“These little curled flaps beside my face,” he said. “Tease one of them gently with a finger and it will give up drops of moisture heavily laced with spice-essence.”\nHe saw the recognition in her eyes. Memories which she did not know as memories were speaking to her. And she was the result of many generations in which the Atreides sensitivity had been increased.\nEven the urgency of her thirst would not yet move her.\nTo ease her through the crisis, he told her about Fremen children poling for sandtrout at an oasis edge, teasing the moisture out of them for quick vitalization.\n“But | am Atreides,” she said.\n“The Oral History tells it truthfully,” he said.\n“Then | could die of it.”\n“That’s the test.”\n“You would make a real Fremen out of me!”\n“How else can you teach your descendants to survive here after | am gone?”\nShe pulled away her mask and moved her face to within a handsbreadth of his. A finger came up and touched one of the curled flaps of his cowl.\n“Stroke it gently,” he said.\nHer hand obeyed not his voice but something from within her. The finger movements were precise, eliciting his own memories, a thing passed from child to child to child... the way so much information and misinformation survived. He turned his face to its limit\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b2bfb80331189a30edebc0a0f4d6d0bb0c150807fea20d0f3318037f6d70405f_v2"}
