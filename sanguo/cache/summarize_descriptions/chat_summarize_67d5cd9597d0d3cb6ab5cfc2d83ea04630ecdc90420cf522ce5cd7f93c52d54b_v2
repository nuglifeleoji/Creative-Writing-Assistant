He was captured by the Eastern Wu (东吴) and subsequently presented to the ruler of Shu (蜀主). This event highlights his importance as a figure caught in the conflicts between the rival states during this tumultuous era.\n\nAdditionally, 张达 is associated with a narrative of vengeance, as he was executed by Zhang Bao, who sought retribution for the death of the legendary warrior Zhang Fei. This connection to Zhang Fei, a prominent figure known for his bravery and loyalty, further emphasizes 张达's involvement in the intricate web of alliances and enmities that characterized the Three Kingdoms.\n\nThrough these events, 张达 emerges as a character intertwined with themes of loyalty, conflict, and the quest for vengeance, reflecting the broader historical and cultural significance of the period.
