Sweetness itself. Another warning signal to the knowledgeable. /’m one of those who pours sugar syrup over everything. “How nice! Such a pleasant time when we’re with you. Isn’t that beautiful! Weren’t you clever to get it so cheaply! Easily. Quickly.” Supply your own adverb.\nGreat Honored Matre was a moment composing herself. She sensed that she had been placed at a disadvantage but could not say how. She covered the moment with an enigmatic smile, then: “But | said | would release you.” She pressed something on the side of her chair and a section of the tubular cage swung aside, taking the shigawire netting with it. In the same instant, a low chair lifted from a panel in the floor directly in front of her and not a pace away.\nLucilla seated herself in the chair, knees almost touching her inquisitor. Feet. Remember they kill with their feet. She flexed her fingers, realizing then that she had been gripping her hands into fists. Damn the tensions!\n“You should have some food and drink,” Great Honored Matre said. She pushed something else on the side of her chair. A tray came up beside Lucilla—plate, spoon, a glass brimming with red liquid. Showing off her toys.\nLucilla picked up the glass.\nPoison? Smell it first.\nShe sampled the drink. Stimtea and melange! /’m hungry. Lucilla returned an empty glass to the tray. The stim on her tongue smelled sharply of melange. What is she doing?\nWooing me? Lucilla felt a flow of relief from the spice. The plate proved to hold beans in a piquant sauce. She ate it all after sampling the first bite for unwanted additives. Garlic in the sauce. She was hung up for the barest fraction of a second on Memory of this ingredient—adjunct to fine cooking, specific against werewolves, potent treatment for flatulence.\n“You find our food pleasant?”\nLucilla wiped her chin. “Very good. You are to be complimented on your chef.” Never compliment the chef in a private establishment. Chefs can be replaced. Hostess is irreplaceable. “A nice touch with garlic.”\n“We've been studying some of the library salvaged from Lampadas.” Gloating: See what you lost? “So little of interest buried in all of that prattle.”\nDoes she want you to be her librarian? Lucilla waited Silently.\n“Some of my aides think there may be clues to your witches’ nest there or, at least, a way to eliminate you quickly. So many languages!”\nDoes she need a translator? Be blunt!\n“What interests you?”\n“Very little. Who could possibly need accounts of the Butlerian Jihad?”\n“They destroyed libraries, too.”\n“Don’t patronize me!”\nShe’s sharper than we thought. Keep it blunt.\n“I thought | was the object of patronage.”\n“Listen to me, witch! You think you can be ruthless in defense of your nest but you do not understand what it is to be ruthless.”\n“I don’t think you have yet told me how | can satisfy your Curiosity.”\n“It’s your science we want, witch!” She pitched her voice lower. “Let us be reasonable. With your help we could achieve utopia.”\nAnd conquer all of your enemies and achieve orgasm every time.\n“You think science holds the keys to utopia?”\n“And better organization for our affairs.”\nRemember: Bureaucracy elevates conformity ... make that elevates “fatal stupidity” to the status of religion.\n“Paradox, Great Honored Matre. Science must be innovative. It brings change. That’s why science and bureaucracy fight a constant war.”\nDoes she know her roots?\n“But think of the power! Think of what you could control!” She doesn’t know.\nHonored Matre assumptions about control fascinated Lucilla. You controlled your universe; you did not balance with it. You looked outward, never inward. You did not train yourself to sense your own subtle responses, you produced muscles (forces, powers) to overcome everything you defined as an obstacle. Were these women blind?\nWhen Lucilla did not speak, Honored Matre said: “We found much in the library about the Bene Tleilax.\n“You joined them for many projects, witch. Multiple projects: how to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility, how to penetrate the secrets of the living cell, your Missionaria Protectiva, and something called ‘the Language of God.\nLucilla produced a tight smile. Did they fear there might be a real god out there somewhere? Give her a little taste! Be candid.\n1\n“We joined the Tleilaxu in nothing. Your people misinterpret what they found. You worry about being patronized? How do you think God would feel about it? We plant protective religions to help us. That is the Missionaria’s function. The Tleilaxu have only one religion.”\n“You organize religions?”\n“Not quite. The organizational approach to religion is always apologetic. We do not apologize.”\n“You are beginning to bore me. Why did we find so little about the God Emperor?” Pouncing!\n“Perhaps your people destroyed it.”\n“Ahhh, then you do have an interest in him.”\nAnd so do you, Madame Spider!\n“|I would have presumed, Great Honored Matre, that Leto Il and his Golden Path were subjects of study at many of your academic centers.”\nThat was cruel!\n“We have no academic centers!”\n“I find your interest in him surprising.”\n“Casual interest, no more.”\nAnd that Futar sprang from an oak tree struck by lightning!\n“We call his Golden Path ‘the paper chase.’ He blew it into the infinite winds and said: ‘See? There is where it goes.’ That’s the Scattering.”\n“Some prefer to call it the Seeking.”\n“Could he really predict our future? Is that what interests you?” Bullseye!\nGreat Honored Matre coughed into her hand.\n“We say Muad’Dib created a future. Leto II un-created it.”\n“But if | could know...”\n“Please! Great Honored Matre! People who demand that the oracle predict their lives really want to know where the treasure is hidden.”\n“But of course!”\n“Know your entire future and nothing will ever surprise you? Is that it?”\n“In SO many words.”\n“You don’t want the future, you want now extended forever.”\n“| could not have said it better.”\n“And you said | bored you!”\n“What?”\nOrange in her eyes. Careful.\n“Never another surprise? What could be more boring?”\n“Ahhhh ... Oh! But that’s not what | mean.”\n“Then I’m afraid | do not understand what you want, Great Honored Matre.”\n“No matter. We'll return to it tomorrow.\nReprieve!\nGreat Honored Matre stood. “Back into your cage.”\n“Eat?” The Futar sounded plaintive.\n“I have some wonderful food for you downstairs, darling. Then l'Il rub your back.”\nLucilla entered her cage. Great Honored Matre threw a chair cushion in after her. “Use that against the shigawire. See how kind | can be?”\nThe cage door sealed with a click.\nThe Futar in its cage slid back into the wall. The panel Snapped closed over it.\n“They get so restless when they’re hungry,” Great Honored Matre said. She opened the door to the room and turned to contemplate Lucilla for a moment. “You will not be disturbed here. | am refusing permission for anyone else to enter this room.”\nMany things we do naturally become difficult only when we try to make them intellectual subjects. It is possible to know so much about a subject that you become totally ignorant.\n—MENTAT TEXT TWO (DICTO)\n[o eriodically, Odrade went for dinner with acolytes and their Proctor-Watchers, the most immediate warders in this mind-prison from which many would never be released.\nWhat the acolytes thought and did really informed the depths of Mother Superior’s consciousness on how well Chapterhouse functioned. Acolytes responded from their moods and forebodings more directly than Reverend Mothers. Full Sisters got very good at not being seen at their worst. They did not try to conceal essentials, but anyone could walk in an orchard or close a door and be out of the view of watchdogs.\nNot so the acolytes.\nThere was little slack time in Central these days. Even the dining halls had their constant streams of occupants no matter the hour. Workshifts were staggered and it was easy for a Reverend Mother to adjust her circadian rhythms to off- beat time. Odrade could not waste energy on such adjustments. At the evening meal, she paused at the door to the Acolyte Hall and heard the sudden hush.\nEven the way they conveyed food to their mouths said something. Where did the eyes go as the chopsticks progressed mouthward? Was it a quick stab and a rapid chew before a convulsive swallow? That was a one to watch. She was brewing upsets. And that thoughtful one over there who looked at each mouthful as though wondering how they\nhid the poison in such slop? A creative mind behind those eyes. Test her for a more sensitive position.\nOdrade entered the hall.\nThe floor had a large checkerboard pattern, black and white plaz, virtually unscratchable. Acolytes said the pattern was for Reverend Mothers to use as a game board: “Place one of us here and another over there and some along that central line. Move them thus—winner take all.”\nOdrade took a seat near the corner of a table beside the western windows. The acolytes made room for her, their movements quietly unobtrusive.\nThis hall was part of the oldest construction on Chapterhouse. Built of wood with clear-span beams overhead, enormously thick and heavy things finished in dull black. They were some twenty-five meters long without a joint. Somewhere on Chapterhouse there was a grove of genetically tailored oaks reaching up to sunlight in their carefully tended plantations. Trees going up thirty meters at least without a limb, and more than two meters through the boles. They had been planted when this hall was built, replacements for these beams when age weakened them. Nineteen hundred SY the beams were supposed to endure.\nHow carefully the acolytes around her watched Mother Superior without ever appearing to look directly at her.\nOdrade turned her head to peer out the western windows at the sunset. Dust again. The spreading intrusion from the desert inflamed the setting sun and set it glowing like a distant ember that might explode into uncontrollable fire at any instant.\nOdrade suppressed a sigh. Thoughts such as these recreated her nightmare: the chasm... the tightrope. She knew if she closed her eyes she would feel herself swaying on the rope. The hunter with the axe was nearer!\nAcolytes eating close by stirred nervously as though they sensed her disquiet. Perhaps they did. Odrade heard the movement of fabrics and this dragged her out of her\nnightmare. She had become sensitized to a new note in the sounds of Central. There was a grating noise behind the most commonplace movements—that chair being shifted behind her... and the opening of that kitchen door. Rasping grit. Cleaning crews complained of sand and “the damnable dust.”\nOdrade stared out the window at the source of that irritation: wind from the south. A dull haze, something between tan and earth brown, drew a curtain across the horizon. After the wind, dustings of its deposits would be found in building corners and on lee sides of hills. There was a flinty aroma to it, something alkaline that irritated the nostrils.\nShe looked down at the table as a serving acolyte placed her meal in front of her.\nOdrade found herself enjoying", "ytes eating close by stirred nervously as though they sensed her disquiet.

There was a flinty aroma to it, something alkaline that irritated the nostrils.\nShe looked down at the table as a serving acolyte placed her meal in front of her.\nOdrade found herself enjoying this change from quick meals in her workroom and private dining room. When she ate alone up there, acolytes brought food so quietly and cleared away with such silent efficiency that sometimes she was surprised to find everything gone. Here, dining was bustle and conversation. In her quarters, Chef Duana might come in clucking, “You are not eating enough.” Odrade generally heeded such admonitions. Watchdogs had their uses.\nTonight’s meal was sligpork in a sauce of soy and molasses, minimal melange, a touch of basil and lemon. Fresh green beans cooked al dente with peppers. Dark red grape juice to drink. She took a bite of sligpork with anticipation and found it passable, a bit overcooked for her taste. Acolyte chefs had not missed it by much.\nThen why this feeling of too many such meals?\nShe swallowed and hypersensitivity identified additives. This food was not here just to replenish Mother Superior’s energy. Someone in the kitchen had asked for her day’s nutrition list and adjusted this plate accordingly.\nFood is a trap, she thought. More addictions. She did not like the cunning ways Chapterhouse chefs concealed things they put in the food “for the good of the diners.” They knew, of course, that a Reverend Mother could identify ingredients and adjust metabolism within her limits. They were watching her right now, wondering how Mother Superior would judge tonight’s menu.\nAs she ate, she listened to the other diners. None intruded on her—not physically or vocally. Sounds returned almost to what they had been before her entrance. Waggling tongues always changed their tone slightly when she entered and resumed at lower volume.\nAn unspoken question lay in all of those busy minds around her: Why is she here tonight?\nOdrade sensed quiet awe in some nearby diners, a reaction Mother Superior sometimes employed to her advantage. Awe with an edge on it. Acolytes whispered among themselves (so the Proctors reported), “She has Taraza.” They meant Odrade possessed her late predecessor as Primary. The two of them were a historical pair, required study for postulants.\nDar and Tar, already a legend.\nEven Bellonda (dear old vicious Bell) came at Odrade obliquely because of this. Few frontal attacks, very little blaring in her accusatory arguments. Taraza was credited with saving the Sisterhood. That silenced much opposition. Taraza had said Honored Matres were essentially barbarians and their violence, although not totally deflectable, could be guided into bloody displays. Events had more or less verified this.\nCorrect up to a point, Tar. None of us anticipated the extent of their violence.\nTaraza’s classical veronica (how apt the bullring image) had aimed the Honored Matres into such episodes of carnage that the universe was mordant with potential Supporters of their brutalized victims.\nHow do I defend us?\nIt was not so much that defensive plans were inadequate. They could become irrelevant.\nThat, of course, is what I seek. We must be purified and made ready for a supreme effort.\nBellonda had sneered at that idea. “For our demise? Is that why we must be purified?”\nBellonda would be ambivalent when she discovered what Mother Superior planned. Bellonda-vicious would applaud. Bellonda-Mentat would argue for delay “until a more propitious moment.”\nBut | will seek my own peculiar way despite what my Sisters think.\nAnd many Sisters thought Odrade quite the strangest Mother Superior they had ever accepted. Elevated more with the left hand than with the right. Taraza Primary. | was there when you died, Tar. No one else to gather your persona. Elevation by accident?\nMany disapproved of Odrade. But when opposition arose, back they went to “Taraza Primary—the best Mother Superior in our history.”\nAmusing! Taraza Within was the quickest to laugh and ask: Why don’t you tell them about my mistakes, Dar? Especially about how | misjudged you.\nOdrade chewed reflectively on a bite of sligpork. /’m overdue for a visit to Sheeana. South into the desert and that soon. Sheeana must be made ready to replace Tam.\nThe changing landscape loomed large in Odrade’s thoughts. More than fifteen hundred years of Bene Gesserit occupancy on Chapterhouse. Signs of us everywhere. Not just in special groves or vineyards and orchards. What it must be doing to the collective psyche, seeing such changes come over their familiar land.\nThe acolyte seated beside Odrade made a soft throat- clearing sound. Was she about to address Mother Superior?\nA rare occurrence. The young woman continued to eat without speaking.\nOdrade’s thoughts returned to the prospective journey into the desert. Sheeana must have no forewarning. / must be sure she is the one we need. There were questions for Sheeana to answer.\nOdrade knew what she would find on inspection stops en route. In Sisters, in plant and animal life, in the very foundations of Chapterhouse, she would see changes gross and changes subtle, things to wrench at Mother Superior’s vaunted serenity. Even Murbella, never out of the no-ship, sensed these changes.\nOnly that morning, seated with her back to her console, Murbella had listened with new attentiveness to Odrade standing over her. Edgy alertness in the captive Honored Matre. Her voice betrayed doubts and unbalanced judgments.\n“Allis transient, Mother Superior?”\n“That is knowledge impressed on you by Other Memory. No planet, no land or sea, no part of any land or sea is here forever.”\n“A morbid thought!” Rejection.\n“Wherever we stand, we are only stewards.”\n“A useless viewpoint.” Hesitant, questioning why Mother Superior chose this moment to say such things.\n“| hear Honored Matres talking through you. They gave you greedy dreams, Murbella.”\n“So you say!” Deeply resentful.\n“Honored Matres think they can buy infinite security: a Small planet, you know, with plenty of subservient population.”\nMurbella produced a grimace.\n“More planets!” Odrade snapped. “Always more and more and more! That’s why they come swarming back.”\n“Poor pickings in this Old Empire.”\n“Excellent, Murbella! You’re beginning to think like one of\nus.”\n“And that makes me a nothing!”\n“Neither fish nor fowl, but your own true self? Even there, you're only a steward. Beware, Murbella! If you think you own something, that’s like walking on quicksand.”\nThis got a puzzled frown. Something would have to be done about the way Murbella allowed her emotions to play SO openly on her face. It was permissible here, but someday...\n“So nothing is safely owned. So what!” Bitter, bitter.\n“You speak some of the right words but | don’t think you've yet found a place in yourself where you can endure for your lifetime.”\n“Until an enemy finds me and slaughters me?”\nHonored Matre training clings like glue! But she spoke to Duncan the other night in a way that tells me she is ready. The Van Gogh painting, | do believe, has sensitized her. | heard it in her voice. | must review that record.\n“Who would slaughter you, Murbella?”\n“You'll never withstand an Honored Matre attack!”\n“I’ve already stated the basic fact that concerns us: No place is eternally safe.”\n“Another of your useless damned lessons!”\nIn the Acolyte Hall, Odrade recalled she had not found time to review that comeye record of Duncan and Murbella. A sigh almost escaped her. She covered it with a cough. Never do to let the young women see disturbance in Mother Superior.\nTo the desert and Sheeana! Inspection tour as soon as | can make time for it. Time!\nAgain, the acolyte seated beside Odrade made that throat noise. Odrade watched peripherally—blond, short black dress trimmed in white—Intermediate Third Stage. No movement of the head toward Odrade, no sidelong glances.\nThis is what I will find on my inspection tour: Fears. And in the landscape, those things we always see when we run out of time: trees left uncut because woodcutters have gone— dragooned into our Scattering, gone to their graves, gone to unknown places, perhaps even to peonage. Will | see architectural Fancies becoming attractive because they are incomplete, builders departed? No. We don’t go in much for Fancies.\nOther Memory held examples she wished she might find: old buildings more beautiful because they were unfinished. The builder bankrupt, an owner angered at his mistress... Some things were more interesting because of that: old walls, old ruins. Time sculpture.\nWhat would Bell say if | ordered a Fancy in my favorite orchard?\nThe acolyte beside Odrade said: “Mother Superior?”\nExcellent! They so seldom find the courage.\n“Yes?” Faint questioning. This had better be important. Would she hear?\nShe heard. “I intrude, Mother Superior, because of the urgency and because | know your interest in the orchards.”\nSuperb! This acolyte had thick legs but that did not extend to her mind. Odrade stared at her silently.\n“lam the one making the map for your bedchamber, Mother Superior.”\nSo this was a reliable adept, a person trusted with work for Mother Superior. Even better.\n“Will | have my map soon?”\n“Two days, Mother Superior. | am adjusting projection overlays where | will mark the desert’s daily growth.”\nA brief nod. That had been in the original order: an acolyte to keep the map current. Odrade wanted to awaken each morning, her imagination ignited by that changing view, the first thing impressed on awareness at arising.\n“| put a report in your workroom this morning, Mother Superior. ‘Orchard Management.’ Perhaps you did not see\nit.”\nOdrade had seen only the label. She had been late coming from exercises, anxious to visit Murbella. So much depended on Murbella!\n“The plantations around Central must either be abandoned or action taken to sustain them,” the acolyte said. “That’s the gist of the report.”\n“Repeat the report verbatim.”\nNight fell and the room lights brightened as Odrade listened. Concise. Terse even. The report carried a note of admonishment Odrade recognized as originating with Bellonda. No Archival signature but Weather’s warnings went through Archives and this acolyte had lifted some of the original words.\nThe acolyte fell silent, report concluded.\nHow do I respond? Orchards, pastures and vineyards were not merely a buffer against alien intrusions, pleasant decorations on the landscape. They", " put a report in your workroom this morning, Mother Superior. ‘Orchard Management.’ Perhaps you did not see\nit.”\nOdrade had seen only the label.

Orchards, pastures and vineyards were not merely a buffer against alien intrusions, pleasant decorations on the landscape. They supported Chapterhouse morale and tables.\nThey support my morale.\nHow quietly this acolyte waited. Curly blond hair and round face. Pleasing countenance, though the mouth was wide. Food remained on her plate but she was not eating. Hands folded in her lap. / am here to serve you, Mother Superior.\nWhile Odrade composed her response, memory intruded —an old incident simulflowing over immediate observations. She remembered her ornithopter training course. Two acolyte students with instructor at midday high over the wetlands of Lampadas. She had been paired with as inept an acolyte as could have been accepted by the Sisterhood. Obviously a gene-choice. The Breeding Mistresses wanted her for a characteristic to be passed along to offspring. /t certainly wasn’t emotional balance or intelligence! Odrade remembered the name: Linchine.\nLinchine had shouted at their instructor: “I am going to fly this damned ‘thopter!”\nAnd all the while a whirling sky and landscape of trees and marshy lakeshore dizzied them. That was how it seemed: us stationary and the world moving. Linchine doing the wrong thing every time. Each movement created worse gyrations.\nThe instructor cut her out of the system by pulling the disconnect only he could reach. He did not speak until they were flying straight and level.\n“No way are you ever going to fly this, lady. Not ever! You don’t have the right reactions. You have to begin training those into someone like you before puberty.”\n“Lam! lam! l'Il fly this damned thing.” Hands jerking at the useless controls.\n“You're washed out, lady. Grounded!”\nOdrade breathed easier, realizing she had known all along that Linchine might kill them.\nWhirling toward Odrade in the rear, Linchine screamed: “Tell him! Tell him he must obey a Bene Gesserit!”\nAddressing the fact that Odrade, several years ahead of Linchine, already displayed a commanding presence.\nOdrade sat in silence, features immobile.\nSilence is often the best thing to say, some Bene Gesserit humorist had scrawled on a washroom mirror. Odrade found that good advice then and later.\nRecalling herself to the needs of the acolyte in the dining hall, Odrade wondered why that old memory had come of itself. Such things seldom happened without purpose. Not silence now, certainly. Humor? Yes! That was the message. Odrade’s humor (applied later) had taught Linchine something about herself. Humor under stress.\nOdrade smiled at the acolyte beside her in the dining hall. “How would you like to be a horse?”\n“What?” The word was startled out of her but she responded to Mother Superior’s smile. Nothing alarming in\nthat. Warm even. Everyone said Mother Superior permitted affections.\n“You don’t understand, of course,” Odrade said.\n“No, Mother Superior.” Still smiling and patient.\nOdrade allowed her gaze to quest over the young face. Clear blue eyes not yet touched by the engulfing blue of Spice Agony. A mouth almost like Bell’s but without the viciousness. Dependable muscles and dependable intelligence. She would be good at anticipating Mother Superior’s needs. Witness her map assignment and that report. Sensitive. Went with her superior intelligence. Not likely to rise to the very top but always in key positions where you needed her qualities.\nWhy did I sit beside this one?\nOdrade frequently selected a particular companion at mealtime visits. Acolytes mostly. They could be so revealing. Reports often found their way to Mother Superior’s workroom: personal observations from Proctors about one acolyte or another. But sometimes, Odrade chose a seat for no reason she could explain. As / did tonight. Why this one?\nConversation rarely occurred unless Mother Superior initiated it. Gentle initiation usually, easing into more intimate matters. Others around them listened avidly.\nAt such moments, Odrade often produced a manner of almost religious serenity. It soothed nervous ones. Acolytes were... well, acolytes, but Mother Superior was the Supreme witch of them all. Nervousness was natural.\nSomeone behind Odrade whispered: “She has Streggi on the coals tonight.”\nOn the coals. Odrade knew the expression. It had been used in her acolyte days. So this one was named Streggi. Let it be unspoken for now. Names carry magic.\n“Do you enjoy tonight’s dinner?” Odrade asked.\n“It’s acceptable, Mother Superior.” One tried not to give false opinions, but Streggi was confused by the shift in conversation.\n“They've overcooked it,” Odrade said.\n“Serving so many, how can they please everyone, Mother Superior?”\nShe speaks her mind and speaks it well.\n“Your left hand is trembling,” Odrade said.\n“I’m nervous with you, Mother Superior. And I’ve just come from the practice floor. Very tiring today.”\nOdrade analyzed the tremors. “They have you doing the long-arm lift.”\n“Was it painful in your day, Mother Superior?” (In those ancient times?)\n“Just as painful as today. Pain teaches, they told me.”\nThat softened things. Shared experiences, the patter of the Proctors.\n“| don’t understand about horses, Mother Superior.” Streggi looked at her plate. “This cannot be horse meat. I’m surel...”\nOdrade laughed loudly, attracting startled looks. She put a hand on Streggi’s arm and subsided to a gentle smile. “Thank you, my dear. No one has made me laugh that much in years. | hope this is the beginning of a long and joyous association.”\n“Thank you, Mother Superior, but I—”\n“I will explain about the horse, my own little joke and no intent to demean you. | want you to carry a young child on your shoulders, to move him more rapidly than his short legs will carry him.”\n“As you wish, Mother Superior.” No objections, no more questions. Questions were there, but the answers would come in their own time and Streggi knew it.\nMagic time.\nWithdrawing her hand, Odrade said: “Your name?”\n“Streggi, Mother Superior. Aloana Streggi.”\n“Rest easy, Streggi. | will see to the orchards. We need them for morale as much as for food. You report to\nReassignment tonight. Tell them | want you in my workroom at six tomorrow morning.”\n“I will be there, Mother Superior. Will | continue to mark your map?” As Odrade was rising to leave.\n“For now, Streggi. But ask Reassignment for a new acolyte and begin training her. Soon, you will be much too busy for the map.”\n“Thank you, Mother Superior. The desert is growing very fast.”\nStreggi’s words gave Odrade a certain satisfaction, dispelling gloom that had hampered her most of the day.\nThe cycle was getting another chance, turning once more as it was impelled to do by those subterranean forces called “life” and “love” and other unnecessary labels.\nThus it turns. Thus it renews. Magic. What witchery could take your attention from this miracle?\nIn her workroom, she issued an order to Weather, then silenced the tools of her office and went to the bow window. Chapterhouse glowed pale red in the night from reflections of groundlights against low clouds. It gave a romantic appearance to rooftops and walls that Odrade quickly rejected.\nRomance? There was nothing romantic about what she had done in the Acolyte Dining Hall.\n| have finally done it. | have committed myself. Now, Duncan must restore our Bashar’s memories. A delicate assignment.\nShe continued to stare into the night, suppressing knots in her stomach.\n| not only commit myself but | commit what remains of my Sisterhood. So this is how it feels, Tar.\nThis is how it feels and your plan is tricky.\nIt was going to rain. Odrade sensed it in the air coming through the ventilators around the window. No need to read a Weather Dispatch. She seldom did that these days,\nanyway. Why bother? But Streggi’s report carried a potent warning.\nRains were becoming rarer here and rather to be welcomed. Sisters would emerge to walk in it despite the cold. There was a touch of sadness in the thought. Each rain she saw brought the same question: /s this the last one?\nThe people of Weather did heroic things to keep an expanding desert dry and the growing areas irrigated. Odrade did not know how they had managed this rain to comply with her order. Before long, they would not be able to obey such commands, even from Mother Superior. The desert will triumph because that is what we have set in motion.\nShe opened the central panes of her window. The wind at this level had stopped. Just the clouds moving overhead. Wind at higher elevations harrying things along. A sense of urgency in the weather. The air was chilly. So they had made temperature adjustments to bring this bit of rain. She closed the window, feeling no desire to go outside. Mother Superior had no time to play the game of /ast rain. One rain ata time. And always out there the desert moving inexorably toward them.\nThat, we can map and watch. But what of the hunter behind me—the nightmare figure with the axe? What map tells me where she is tonight?\nReligion (emulation of adults by the child) encysts past mythologies: guesses, hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, pronouncements made in search of personal power, all mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always an unspoken commandment: Thou shalt not question! We break that commandment daily in the harnessing of human imagination to our deepest creativity.\n— BENE GESSERIT CREDO\nMI urbella sat cross-legged on the practice floor, alone, shivering after her exertions. Mother Superior had been here less than an hour this afternoon. And, as often happened, Murbella felt she had been abandoned in a fever dream.\nOdrade’s parting words reverberated in the dream: “The hardest lesson for an acolyte to learn is that she must always go the limit. Your abilities will take you farther than you imagine. Don’t imagine, then. Extend yourself!”\nWhat is my response? That I was taught to cheat? Odrade had done something to call up the patterns of childhood and Honored Matre education. / learned cheating\nas an infant. How to simulate a need and gain attention. Many “how-to’s” in the cheating pattern. The older she got, the easier the cheating. She had learned what the big people around her were demanding. / regurgitated on demand.
