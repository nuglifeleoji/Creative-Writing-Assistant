Say only the deepest truth you can sense, she reminded herself. Those warning words from a teacher carried more meaning now. She kept her eyes Slightly unfocused and aimed at the floor directly in front of the two women, avoiding the worst of the brilliant sunlight. She still felt her heart beating too rapidly and knew the Reverend Mothers would detect this. Odrade had demonstrated it many times.\n“Well it should frighten you,” Taraza said.\nOdrade asked: “Do you understand what is being said to you, Sheeana?”\n“The Mother Superior wishes to know if | am fully committed to the Sisterhood,” Sheeana said.\nOdrade looked at Taraza and shrugged. There was no need for more discussion of this between them. That was the way of it when you were part of one family as they were in the Bene Gesserit.\nTaraza continued her silent study of Sheeana. It was a heavy gaze, energy-draining for Sheeana, who knew she must remain silent and permit that scorching examination.\nOdrade put down feelings of sympathy. Sheeana was like herself as a young girl, in so many ways. She had that globular intellect which expanded on all surfaces the way a balloon expanded when filled. Odrade recalled how her own teachers had been admiring of this, but wary, just the way Taraza was now wary. Odrade had recognized this wariness while even younger than Sheeana and held no doubts that Sheeana saw it here. Intellect had its uses.\n“Mmmmmm,” Taraza said.\nOdrade heard the humming sound of the Mother Superior’s internal reflections as part of a simulflow. Odrade’s own memory had surged backward. The Sisters who had brought Odrade her food when she studied late had always loitered to observe her in their special way, just as Sheeana was watched and monitored at all times. Odrade had known about those special ways of observing from an early age. That was, after all, one of the great lures of the Bene Gesserit. You wanted to be capable of such esoteric abilities. Sheeana certainly possessed this desire. It was the dream of every postulant.\nThat such things might be possible for me!\nTaraza spoke finally: “What is it you think you want from us, child?”\n“The same things you thought you wanted when you were my age, Mother Superior.”\nOdrade suppressed a smile. Sheeana’s wild sense of independence had skated close to insolence there and\nTaraza certainly recognized this.\n“You think that is a proper use for the gift of life?” Taraza asked.\n“It is the only use | know, Mother Superior.”\n“Your candor is appreciated but | warn you to be careful in your use of it,” Taraza said.\n“Yes, Mother Superior.”\n“You already owe us much and you will owe us more,” Taraza said. “Remember that. Our gifts do not come cheaply.”\nSheeana has not the vaguest appreciation of what she will pay for our gifts, Odrade thought.\nThe Sisterhood never let its initiates forget what they owed and must repay. You did not repay with love. Love was dangerous and Sheeana already was learning this. The gift of life? A shudder began to course through Odrade and she cleared her throat to compensate.\nAm | alive? Perhaps when they took me away from Mama Sibia I died. | was alive there in that house but did I live after the Sisters removed me?\nTaraza said: “You may leave us now, Sheeana.”\nSheeana turned on one heel and left the room but not before Odrade saw the tight smile on the young face. Sheeana knew she had passed the Mother Superior’s examination.\nWhen the door closed behind Sheeana, Taraza said: “You mentioned her natural ability with Voice. | heard it, of course. Remarkable.”\n“She kept it well bridled,” Odrade said. “She has learned not to try it on us.”\n“What do we have there, Dar?”\n“Perhaps someday a Mother Superior of extraordinary abilities.”\n“Not too extraordinary?”\n“We will have to see.”\n“Do you think she is capable of killing for us?”\nOdrade was startled and showed it. “Now?”\n“Yes, of course.”\n“The ghola?”\n“Teg would not do it,” Taraza said. “I even have doubts about Lucilla. Their reports make it clear that he is capable of forging powerful bonds of .. . of affinity.”\n“Even as |?”\n“Schwangyu herself was not completely immune.”\n“Where is the noble purpose in such an act?” Odrade asked. “Isn’t this what the Tyrant’s warning has—”\n“Him? He killed many times!”\n“And paid for it.”\n“We pay for everything we take, Dar.”\n“Even for a life?”\n“Never forget for one instant, Dar, that a Mother Superior is capable of making any necessary decision for the Sisterhood’s survival!”\n“So be it,” Odrade said. “Take what you want and pay for it.”\nIt was the proper reply but it reinforced the new strength Odrade felt, this freedom to respond in her own way within a new universe. Where had such toughness originated? Was it something out of her cruel Bene Gesserit conditioning? Was it from her Atreides ancestry? She did not try to fool herself that this came from a decision never again to follow another’s moral guidance rather than her own. This inner stability upon which she now stationed herself was not a pure morality. Not bravado, either. Those were never enough.\n“You are very like your father,” Taraza said. “Usually, it’s the dam who provides most of the courage but this time | think it was the father.”\n“Miles Teg is admirably courageous but | think you oversimplify,” Odrade said.\n“Perhaps | do. But | have been right about you at every turn, Dar, even back there when we were student\npostulants.”\nShe knows! Odrade thought.\n“We don’t need to explain it,” Odrade said. And she thought: /t comes from being born who | am, trained and shaped the way |!was...the way we both were: Dar and Tar.\n“It’s something in the Atreides line that we have not fully analyzed,” Taraza said.\n“No genetic accidents?”\n“I sometimes wonder if we’ve suffered any real accidents since the Tyrant,” Taraza said.\n“Did he stretch out back there in his citadel and look across the millennia to this very moment?”\n“How far back would you reach for the roots?” Taraza asked.\nOdrade said: “What really happens when a Mother Superior commands the Breeding Mistresses: ‘Have that one go breed with that one’?”\nTaraza produced a cold smile.\nOdrade felt herself suddenly at the crest of a wave, awareness pushing all of her over into this new realm. Taraza wants my rebellion! She wants me as her opponent!\n“Will you see Waff now?” Odrade asked.\n“First, | want your assessment of him.”\n“He sees us as the ultimate tool to create the ‘Tleilaxu Ascendancy.’ We are God’s gift to his people.”\n“They have been waiting a long time for this,” Taraza said. “To dissemble so carefully, all of them for all of those eons!”\n“They have our view of time,” Odrade agreed. “That was the final thing to convince them we share their Great Belief.”\n“But why the clumsiness?” Taraza asked. “They are not stupid.”\n“It diverted our attention from how they were really using their ghola process,” Odrade said. “Who could believe\nstupid people would do such a thing?”\n“And what have they created?” Taraza asked. “Only the image of evil stupidity?”\n“Act stupid long enough and you become stupid,” Odrade said. “Perfect the mimicry of your Face Dancers and...”\n“Whatever happens, we must punish them,” Taraza said. “I see that clearly. Have him brought up here.”\nAfter Odrade had given the order and while they waited, Taraza said: “The sequencing of the ghola’s education became a shambles even before they escaped from the Gammu Keep. He leaped ahead of his teachers to grasp things that were only implied and he did this at an alarmingly accelerated rate. Who knows what he has become by now?”\nHistorians exercise great power and some of them know it. They re-create the past, changing it to fit their own interpretations. Thus, they change the future as well.\n—LETO Il, HIS VOICE, FROM DAR-ES-BALAT\nD uncan followed his guide through the dawn light at a punishing clip. The man might look old but he was as springy as a gazelle and seemed incapable of tiring.\nOnly a few minutes ago they had put aside their night goggles. Duncan was glad to be rid of them. Everything outside the reach of the glasses had been black in the dim starlight filtering through heavy branches. There had been no world ahead of him beyond the range of the glasses. The view at both sides jerked and flowed—now a clump of yellow bushes, now two silver-bark trees, now a stone wall with a plasteel gate cut into it and guarded by the flickering blue of a burn-shield, then an arched bridge of native rock, all green and black underfoot. After that, an arched entry of polished white stone. The structures all appeared very old and expensive, maintained by costly handwork.\nDuncan had no idea where he was. None of this terrain recalled his memories of the long-lost Giedi Prime days.\nDawn revealed that they were following a tree-shielded animal track up a hillside. The climb became steep. Occasional glimpses through trees on their left revealed a valley. A hanging mist stood guard over the sky, hiding the distances, enclosing them as they climbed. Their world became progressively a smaller place as it lost its connection with a larger universe.\nAt one brief pause, not for rest but for listening to the forest around them, Duncan studied his mist-capped\nsurroundings. He felt dislodged, removed from a universe that possessed sky and the open features that linked it to other planets.\nHis disguise was simple: Tleilaxu cold-weather garments and cheek pads to make his face appear rounder. His curly black hair had been straightened by some chemical applied with heat. The hair was then bleached to a sandy blond and hidden under a dark watchcap. All of his genital hair had been shaved away. He hardly recognized himself in the mirror they held up for him.\nA dirty Tleilaxu!\nThe artisan who created this transformation was an old woman with glittering gray-green eyes. “You are now a Tleilaxu Master,” she said. “Your name is Wose. A guide will take you to the next place. You will treat him like a Face Dancer if you meet strangers. Otherwise, do as he commands.”\nThey led him out of the cave complex along a twisting passage, its walls and ceiling thick with the musky green algae. In starlighted darkness, they thrust him from the passage into a chilly night and the hands of an unseen man —a bulky figure in padded clothing.\nA voice behind Duncan whispered: “Here he is, Ambitorm. Get him through.”\nThe guide spoke in an accent of gutturals: “Follow me.” He clipped a lead cord to Duncan’s belt, adjusted the night goggles and turned away. Duncan felt the cord tug once and they were off.\nDuncan recognized the use of the cord. It was not something to keep him close behind. He could see\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young postulant in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, demonstrating remarkable intellect and independence, and is under close scrutiny by the Reverend Mothers for her potential future role in the Sisterhood.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, a powerful and authoritative figure who oversees the training and evaluation of postulants like Sheeana.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, known for her analytical mind and deep understanding of the Sisterhood's ways.
