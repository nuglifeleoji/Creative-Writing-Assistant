\n　　少平和小黑子相跟着奔跑，嘴里不断喊叫：“明明，加油！明明，加油！”这一刻里，他似乎也变成了孩子，专注而狂热地渴望一种胜利！ \n　　明明小胸脯一挺，第一个冲过终点。 \n　　随即赶来的少平一把抱住他，笑着，喊叫着，滚在了一起；小黑子也扑上来，和他们乐成了一团……当明明骄傲地站在冠军台上，领取那张奖状和一个塑料铅笔盒时，少平的眼睛都潮湿了——这比他自己领那张“青年突击手”的奖状更激动！小黑竟然窜上了领奖台，前爪搭在明明身上，用舌头舔他的手，逗得全场一片大笑。运动会结束后，他们就象凯旋的士兵一般返回到家中。惠英嫂高兴得不知说什么是好。他们一齐动手，把明明赛跑冠军的奖状贴在了那张“三好学生”的奖状旁。 \n　　直到吃过晚饭，天完全黑了的时候，少平才带着一种满足的心情离开了惠英家。当他走到坡底下的水管旁，却意外地发现安锁子正站在那里。 \n　　“你干啥哩？”他惊奇地问。 \n　　“我来找你哩！”安锁子手里还提着一把电筒。“什么事？” \n　　“黄原来个人，说找你哩！我寻思你大概在这里……”谁呢？少平一时想不起黄原谁会来找他。 \n　　“你刚到这儿？”他问安锁子。 \n　　“我来好一阵了。”安锁子咧嘴一笑。 \n　　“那你为什么不上来找我？” \n　　“嘿嘿……我怕你们正……”安锁子怪眉怪眼笑着，把脸扭到一边。 \n　　少平真想煽这家伙一记耳光。他显然是暗示他和惠英有什么不能见人的“勾当”。 \n

\n　　八年过去了，他的梦魂还在远方的那片草原上游荡，寻找失落的马群和那个黑眼睛红脸蛋的牧马姑娘……他和少平一样，今年二十六岁了。二十六岁，不仅到了谈恋爱的年龄，甚至也可以结婚了。他仍旧孑然一身，只和汽车为伴。 \n　　几年来，他也经别人介绍和自己认识的�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
