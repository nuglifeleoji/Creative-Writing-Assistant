�轩宇早就发现了，这些十年的熔岩犬智慧非常低下，几乎只有战斗本能，就算是百年熔岩犬，也绝对算不上聪明。这可能就是因为这是初级考核的原因。\n\n    果然，最先冲出来的几只熔岩犬一一被冰刺刺穿。蓝轩宇猛然跃起，右手成爪，直接抓向斗兽场墙壁。\n\n    金纹蓝银草金光闪烁，他的五指如勾，一块块鳞片浮现而出，宛如切豆腐一般抓入石壁，把自己掉在其上。\n\n    左手一枚枚冰锥不断的向下发射。\n\n    最先冲出来的熔岩犬本就混乱，前面的几只撞死了，后面的熔岩犬依旧再继续冲出来，被他从头顶上射杀，一会儿就死了十几只。而另外三个方向的熔岩犬，则是快速朝着这边冲过来。\n\n    如果只是十年熔岩犬，如果蓝轩宇自身魂力足够，他甚至可以通过这个方法将所有的熔岩犬击杀。可是，他不行。只有十四级的魂力，根本支持不了他持续释放上百枚冰锥，更何况还有百年熔岩犬呢。\n\n    所以，从一开始他就想好了，今天的战斗方式绝对不是以左手为主，而是右手。\n\n    没有钱磊和刘锋，固然让他少了臂助，但同样的，也少了拖累。他自己一个人，才能将自身步法的优势完全发挥出来。\n\n    趁着另外三个方向的熔岩犬还没有到来，蓝轩宇猛的从天而降，直接跳跃到最后冲出来的一只熔岩犬背上，右拳下砸，直接砸在那熔岩犬腰部。\n\n    犬类和狼类魂兽一样，都有铜头铁骨豆腐腰的说法。今天在课上听季洪彬讲魂兽特性的时候，蓝轩宇突然想到这一点，这也是为什么他想要来训练场尝试一下的原因。\n\n    果然，那十年熔岩犬悲鸣一声，瘫软在地。腰部正是它们的要害。\n\n    而前面的十年熔岩犬还没反应过来，蓝轩宇已经冲上去，连续两拳，又砸中两头熔岩犬的腰部，将它们打倒在地，然后掉头就跑。\n\n    每天吃那么多珍稀食材可不是白吃的，论身体素质，蓝轩宇在同龄人中绝对是佼佼者。\n\n    他这个方向的熔岩犬，已经连续让他杀了十多只。但他知道，自己不能停留，还有那么多其他方向的，稍候还有百年熔岩犬呢。\n\n    他这一跑，顿时引着众多十年熔岩犬朝着他的方向追来。蓝轩宇也不停留，纯粹论速度，他比熔岩犬还是有所不如的，但他有办法啊！\n\n    不时左手挥出，地面上就会出现那么一两根冰刺。然\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
