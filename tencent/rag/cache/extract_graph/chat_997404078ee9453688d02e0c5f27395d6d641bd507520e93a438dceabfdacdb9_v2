It cannot be.\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| t was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, Spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.\nAn ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the center of the room. Veriform Suspensor Chairs ringed it, two of them occupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with sullen eyes. The other held a Slender, short man with effeminate face.\nBoth youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows spinning it.\nA chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle: “There it is, Piter—the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke’s headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?”\n“Assuredly, Baron,” said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet, musical quality.\nThe fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest cloudmilk diamonds.\nThe fat hand moved, tracing details on the Surface. “I invite you to observe,” the basso voice rumbled. “Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd- Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south—these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps—so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique victory.”\nA smile touched Piter’s lips. “And to think, Baron: the Padishah Emperor believes he’s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.”\n“That’s a nonsensical statement,” the Baron rumbled. “You say this to confuse young Feyd- Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.”\nThe sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black leotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him.\nPiter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.\n“Well?” the Baron demanded.\n“The fool answered us, Baron!”\n“Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?” the Baron asked. “Well, what does he say?”\n“He’s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as ‘Harkonnen’—no ‘Sire et Cher Cousin,’ no title, nothing.”\n“It’s a good name,” the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his impatience. “What does dear Leto say?”\n“He says: ‘Your offer of a meeting is refused. | have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know.’”\n“And?” the Baron asked.\n“He says: ‘The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.’ He signs it: ‘Duke Leto of Arrakis.’” Piter began to laugh. “Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is almost too rich!”\n“Be silent, Piter,” the Baron said, and the laughter Stopped as though shut off with a switch. “Kanly, is it?” the Baron asked. “Vendetta, heh? And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure | know he means it.”\n“You made the peace gesture,” Piter said. “The forms have been obeyed.”\n“For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,” the Baron said. And he thought: / must do away with that one\nsoon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The Baron stared across the room at his Mentat assassin, seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.\nA grin flashed across Piter’s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like holes. “But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for Dune—and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!”\nIn a cold voice, the Baron said: “You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.”\n“But | am happy, my Baron. Whereas you...you are touched by jealousy.”\n“Piter!”\n“Ah-ah, Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself?”\n“Someday | will have you strangled, Piter.”\n“Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?”\n“Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?”\n“Truth without fear surprises the Baron,” Piter said. His face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask. “Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, | Know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as | am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I’m yet of much use. | know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet— waste not. True, Baron?”\nThe Baron continued to stare at Piter.\nFeyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My uncle cannot talk to his Mentat without arguing. Do they think I’ve nothing to do except listen to their arguments?\n“Feyd,” the Baron said. “I told you to listen and learn when | invited you in here. Are you learning?”\n“Yes, Uncle.” The voice was carefully subservient.\n“Sometimes | wonder about Piter,” the Baron said. “I cause pain out of necessity, but he...l swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, | can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon, and that'll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor...and knowing that will be a terrible thing.”\n“Then why haven’t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs quietly and efficiently?” Piter asked. “You talk of pity, but—”\n“The Duke must know when I encompass his doom,” the Baron said. “And the other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. l'Il gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but | don’t have to like it.”\n“Room to maneuver,” Piter sneered. “Already you have the Emperor’s eyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that’ll be an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.”\n“You'd like to see that, wouldn’t you, Piter?” the Baron asked. “You’d enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle. You’d truly enjoy that.”\n“Does the Baron need to ask?” Piter whispered.\n“You should’ve been a Bashar of the Corps,” the Baron said. “You're too interested in blood and pain. Perhaps | was too quick with my promise of the spoils of Arrakis.”\nPiter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.\n“Do not toy with Piter, Baron,” Piter said. “You promised me the Lady Jessica. You promised her to me.”\n“For what, Piter?” the Baron asked. “For pain?”\nPiter stared at him, dragging out the silence.\nFeyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one Side, said: “Uncle, do | have to stay? You said you’d\n“My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,” the Baron said. He moved within the shadows beside the globe. “Patience, Feyd.” And he turned his attention back to the Mentat. “What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?”\n“The trap will bring him to you, Baron,” Piter muttered.\n“That’s not my question,” the Baron said. “You'll recall that you predicted the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh, Mentat?”\n“I’m not often wrong, Baron,” Piter said, and for the first time there was fear in his voice. “Give me that: I’m not often wrong. And you know yourself\nthese Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor’s consort had produced only females.”\n“Uncle,” said Feyd-Rautha, “you said there’d be something important here for me to—”\n“Listen to my nephew,” the Baron said. “He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he cannot rule himself.” The Baron stirred beside the globe, a Shadow among shadows. “Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, | summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should’ve learned something from this exchange.”\n“But, Uncle—”\n“A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”\n“Yes, but—”\n“Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might’ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he’s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts.
