南澄的心同样很紧张，而且还带着几分期盼，她可是记得，先前乐公子的目光是朝着她这边看过来过，而且好像看的就是自己啊！\n\n    这要是选的是自己，老公会不会吃醋啊？\n\n    南澄偷偷的看了一眼蓝潇，蓝轩宇坐在他们两人中间，蓝潇此时的目光还在台上的乐公子身上，并没有注意到她的偷窥。\n\n    蓝轩宇则是一脸的好奇，根本不太明白这是怎么回事儿。\n\n    当南澄的目光转回台上的时候，顿时有种要心脏骤停的感觉，因为乐公子的目光正是朝着她这边看过来的。\n\n    他、他是在看我吗？南澄的心有些揪紧。然后乐公子的目光就停顿了下来。而这一次，南澄几乎可以感受到他那澄澈的蓝色眼眸，应该就是盯视在自己身上啊！这、这……，难道、难道真的是我？\n\n    然后，台上的乐公子动了。\n\n    他缓缓向前，走到舞台边缘，在观众们的惊呼声中，就那么从舞台上跳了下来，然后就朝着南澄的方向走了过来。\n\n    没办法呼吸了、没办法呼吸了啊！南澄瞬间攥紧拳头。然后她第一反应是扭头看向老公，“蓝潇，如果是我的话，你……”\n\n    蓝潇此时也发现不对了，因为乐公子，竟然就是朝着他们这边走了过来。歌迷们都伸着手，想要触摸他，可不知道为什么，却就是无法接近到他身体一米范围内。\n\n    “这……、这……，你……”蓝潇也不知道该说什么了。可是，有些奇怪的是，面对乐公子，他竟是产生不出多少嫉妒心来。或许是因为，这位乐公子实在是太英俊了吧。\n\n    近了、近了，真的近了。\n\n    南澄的俏脸激动的一片通红，那可是乐公子啊！\n\n    距离越近，他身上那种特殊的气质就越是感受的清晰，越近越帅啊！南澄的双眸都在不自觉的放光了。\n\n    而伴随着乐公子的接近，周围的其他观众们目光也都朝着她这边集中过来，充满了嫉妒和不甘。但是，这是乐公子的选择。\n\n    本来蓝轩宇一家就是坐在第二排的，所以，乐公子过来的很快。当他终于来到南澄面前的时候，南澄已经下意识的站了起来，激动的不能自已。这个位置，只有自己一个女士啊！\n\n    “谢谢。”乐公子向南澄微微颔首致意。然后……、然后他就从南澄身前横移了过去。\n\n    南澄呆住了，周围的其他观众也呆住了。\n\n    南澄突然明白过来，他那一声谢谢，似乎是感谢自己站起来给他让了路？毕竟\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>南澄<|>PERSON<|>南澄 is a character who is
