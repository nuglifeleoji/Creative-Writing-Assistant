He sensed Kynes’ excitement, felt himself caught up in it.\n“Water overshadows the other problems,” Kynes said. “This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants—widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.”\n“Do you have pilot projects?” the Duke asked. “We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect—small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its\nworking facts,” Kynes said.\n“There isn’t enough water,” Bewt said. “There just isn’t enough water.”\n“Master Bewt is an expert on water,” Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! | want an answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?”\nKynes stared at his plate.\nJessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.\n“Is there enough water!” the Duke demanded.\n“There...may be,” Kynes said.\nHe’s faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.\nWith his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But Kynes doesn’t wish it to be known.\n“Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,” Bewt said. “He dreams with the Fremen—of prophecies and messiahs.”\nChuckles sounded at odd places around the table. Jessica marked them—the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.\nTensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There’s too much going on of which I’m not aware. l'Il have to develop new information sources.\nThe Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let down, as though something vital had passed him here. “Maybe,” he muttered.\nKynes spoke quickly: “Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord. There are so many—”\nThe planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke’s side. The man bent, whispering into Leto’s ear.\nJessica recognized the capsign of Hawat’s corps, fought down uneasiness. She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer’s feminine companion—a\ntiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.\n“You've hardly touched your dinner, my dear,” Jessica said. “May | order you something?”\nThe woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: “I’m not very hungry.”\nAbruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of command: “Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention.” He Stepped aside. “Paul, take over as host for me, if you please.”\nPaul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father’s chair, sat down in tt.\nThe Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: “Gurney, please take Paul’s place at table. We mustn’t have an odd number here. When the dinner’s over, | may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call.”\nHalleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.\n“There’s no need for alarm,” the Duke said, “but | must ask that no one leave until our house guard says It’s safe. You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and we'll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.”\nPaul caught the code words in his father’s message— guard-safe-secure-shortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read the same message. They both relaxed.\nThe Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper.\nPaul said: “Please go on with your dinner. | believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water.”\n“May we discuss it another time?” Kynes asked.\n“By all means,” Paul said.\nAnd Jessica noted with pride her son’s dignity, the mature sense of assurance.\nThe banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. “None of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps you’ve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like aman.”\nJessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a hand signal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard.\nBewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.\nPaul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards, looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: “Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He—”\n“Drowned?” It was the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter.\nPaul hesitated, then: “Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.”\n“What an interesting way to die,” she murmured.\nPaul’s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. “The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders—made by another fisherman’s claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat—a craft for traveling on water—that foundered...sank beneath the water. Another fisherman helping recover the body said he’d seen marks like this man’s wounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellow’s shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface—to reach air.”\n“Why is this interesting?” the banker asked.\n“Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable— except when you see it happen in the drawing room.” Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: “And, | should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.”\nA sudden stillness enfolded the room.\nThat was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The house troopers were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.\n“Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!” It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with complete abandon.\nNervous smiles appeared around the table.\nBewt was grinning.\nThe banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.\nKynes said: “One baits an Atreides at his own risk.”\n“Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?” the banker demanded.\nBefore Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: “Sir!” And she thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature’s game. Is he here to try for Paul? Does he have help?\n“My son displays a general garment and you claim it’s cut to your fit?” Jessica asked. “What a fascinating revelation.” She slid a hand down to her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.\nThe banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had focused on the code word: garment. “Prepare for violence.”\nKynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek.\nThe smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. “FII give you a toast,” he said. “To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his actions.”\nWhy do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.\nThe banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent’s face.\nPeople began responding all around the table.\nWhere Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides with Paul. What’s the secret of his power? It can’t be because he’s Judge of the\nChange. That’s temporary. And certainly not because he’s a civil servant.\nShe removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind.\nOnly Paul and the banker—(Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica thought.)—remained empty- handed. The banker’s attention stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate.\n| was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.\nHalleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him: “In our society, people shouldn't be quick to take offense. It’s frequently suicidal.” He looked at the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter beside him. “Don’t you think so, miss?”\n“Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed | do,” she said. “There’s too much violence. It makes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It doesn’t make sense.”\n“Indeed it doesn’t,” Halleck said.\nJessica saw the near perfection of the girl’s act, realized: That empty-headed little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been the first to see it—his training hadn’t overlooked that obvious gambit.\nKynes spoke to the banker: “Isn't another apology in order?”\nThe banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: “My Lady, | fear I’ve overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I’m not accustomed to it.”\nJessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: “When strangers meet, great allowance Should be made for differences of custom and training.”\n“Thank you, my Lady,” he said.\nThe dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward Jessica, said: “The Duke spoke of our being secure here. | do hope that doesn’t mean more fighting.”\nShe was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.\n“Likely this will prove unimportant,” Jessica said. “But there’s so much detail requiring the Duke’s personal attention in these times. As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.” She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. “And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.” She shifted her attention to Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”\n“Indeed it is,” Kynes said.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: “I do believe I'll eat something now. I’d like some of that bird dish you served earlier.”\nJessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were speaking\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUKE<|>PERSON<|>The Duke is a leader who is concerned about water problems on the planet and is involved in security matters<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ATREIDES<|>The Atreides are a noble house involved in political and military conflicts, currently on Arrakis<|>GEO<|>ARRAKIS<|>A desert planet with severe water scarcity issues<|>PERSON<|>KYNES<|>A planetologist who studies Arrakis and has knowledge about its water problems<|>PERSON<|>BEWT<|>An expert on water who interacts with the Duke and Kynes<|>PERSON<|>PAUL<|>The Duke's son who shows maturity and leadership qualities<|>PERSON<|>JESSICA<|>Paul's mother, who is observant and protective of her son<|>PERSON<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>A loyal officer of the Atreides house<|>PERSON<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Another loyal officer of the Atreides house<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HARKONNEN<|>A rival noble house in conflict with the Atreides<|>PERSON<|>BANKER<|>A guest at the dinner who seems to have hostile intentions<|>PERSON<|>STILLSUIT MANUFACTURER'S DAUGHTER<|>A guest at the dinner who may be part of a plot<|>PERSON<|>SMUGGLER TUEK<|>A guest at the dinner who shows support for Paul<|>EVENT<|>DINNER<|>A gathering where tensions and political maneuvers are evident<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DUKE<|>KYNES<|>The Duke seeks Kynes' expertise on water problems<|>7<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DUKE<|>PAUL<|>The Duke trusts Paul to take over as host in his absence<|>8<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>PAUL<|>JESSICA<|>Paul and Jessica share a close mother-son relationship and mutual understanding<|>9<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>JESSICA<|>BANKER<|>Jessica is wary of the banker's intentions<|>6<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>PAUL<|>BANKER<|>Paul and the banker have a tense interaction at the dinner<|>5<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>KYNES<|>BEWT<|>Kynes acknowledges Bewt's expertise on water<|>4<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>ATREIDES<|>HARKONNEN<|>The Atreides and Harkonnen are in a state of enmity and conflict<|>9<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DUKE<|>ATREIDES<|>The Duke is the leader of the Atreides house<|>10<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>PAUL<|>ATREIDES<|>Paul is the heir to the Atreides house<|>10<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>JESSICA<|>ATREIDES<|>Jessica is a member of the Atreides house<|>9<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>ATREIDES<|>Gurney Halleck is a loyal officer of the Atreides house<|>9<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>ATREIDES<|>Duncan Idaho is a loyal officer of the Atreides house<|>9<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>STILLSUIT MANUFACTURER'S DAUGHTER<|>BANKER<|>The stillsuit manufacturer's daughter and the banker may be part of a plot<|>5<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>SMUGGLER TUEK<|>PAUL<|>Smuggler Tuek shows support for Paul<|>6<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>KYNES<|>ARRAKIS<|>Kynes is the planetologist studying Arrakis<|>8<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DUKE<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Duke is currently on Arrakis dealing with its problems<|>7<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>ATREIDES<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Atreides house is currently on Arrakis<|>7<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>HARKONNEN<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Harkonnens are also involved on Arrakis<|>6<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>ATREIDES<|>The dinner is hosted by the Atreides<|>8<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>DUKE<|>The Duke is the host of the dinner<|>9<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>PAUL<|>Paul takes over as host when the Duke leaves<|>8<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>JESSICA<|>Jessica is present at the dinner and observes the guests<|>7<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>BANKER<|>The banker is a guest at the dinner with hostile intentions<|>6<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>STILLSUIT MANUFACTURER'S DAUGHTER<|>The stillsuit manufacturer's daughter is a guest at the dinner<|>5<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>SMUGGLER TUEK<|>Smuggler Tuek is a guest at the dinner<|>5<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>KYNES<|>Kynes is a guest at the dinner<|>6<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>BEWT<|>Bewt is a guest at the dinner<|>5<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>Gurney Halleck is present at the dinner<|>6<|>RELATIONSHIP<|>DINNER<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Duncan Idaho is present at the dinner<|>6<|>COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
