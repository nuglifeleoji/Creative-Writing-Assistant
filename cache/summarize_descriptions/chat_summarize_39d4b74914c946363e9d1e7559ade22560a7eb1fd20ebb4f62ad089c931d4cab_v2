His presence on the vessel is kept secret, suggesting he may be held as a bargaining chip or for strategic purposes. The no-ship serves as both a prison and a safeguard, isolating Scytale from external influence while ensuring his knowledge or value can be leveraged if needed. Despite the ambiguity surrounding his exact role or fate, it is clear that his confinement is deliberate, emphasizing the no-ship's function as a secure and clandestine environment. The presence of Murbella and Duncan Idaho further underscores the significance of the no-ship as a nexus of key players in the unfolding events.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions, confirming Scytale's imprisonment on the no-ship while acknowledging the strategic implications of his captivity.
