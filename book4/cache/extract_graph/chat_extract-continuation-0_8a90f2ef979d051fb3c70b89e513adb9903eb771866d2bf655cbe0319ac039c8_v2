，到时候在石圪节或者米家镇给你瞅个人家。俊斌人倒老实，可老实得太死相了，屙屎倒把个命送了！以后寻个灵巧的手艺人，吃酸的喝辣的你也过几天自在日子！” \n　　王彩娥坐在炕头上，红肿着眼睛一句话也不说，只是听她妈精明地给她安排往后的出路……下午三点钟左右，全双水村的人都先后来到了庙坪。破庙前面的追悼会场里，顿时挤满了黑鸦鸦的人群。贺凤英端着个簸箕，把里面的小白纸花给来人一人一朵散发着。庄稼人都新奇而笨拙地把这纸花挽在自己胸前的钮扣上。 \n　　黑云彩已经呈扇形从田家圪崂的土山上空铺过来，遮住了偏西的太阳。大地一时变得昏暗起来。紧接着，天空打响了第一声炸雷！ \n　　眼看天要下雨，追悼会就马上在隆隆的雷声中开始了。 \n　　追悼会由金俊山主持。第一项脱帽致哀。庄稼人纷纷摸掉自己头上汗渍渍的毛巾，把头垂下。 \n　　第二项由孙玉亭致悼词。玉亭把胸前别着的那卷纸拿出来展开，走到人群面前念道：“金俊斌同志为了革命事业，于昨天夜晚与我们永别了，享年三十八岁……” \n　　孙玉亭念着按报纸上的格式写成的这篇悼词，大家都静静地听着。只有田二例外。这位长着伟大额头的“半脑壳”，正在肃穆的人堆里走来走去，把掉在地上的那些纸花纸片捡起来，装进自己衣襟上的那个大口袋里。他一边捡这些东西，一边嘴角挂着神秘的微笑，嘟囔说：“世事要变了……”有些人已经被田二逗得偷着笑了。孙玉亭不时停下来，气愤地瞅一眼人群中的田二。金富和金强立刻走过来，把这个捣乱分子从人群里拉出来，一直把他扭送过东拉河。田二一路囔叫着说：“世事要变了！世事要变了……” \n　　孙玉亭的悼词快念完的时候，又一声炸雷在人们的头上滚过，惊得人群一阵骚乱。接着，起风了。狂风卷着沙尘和碎柴烂草，一霎时把天地搅成了一片混沌。 \n　　追悼会匆匆地进行完仪式，接着就赶快起灵。 \n　　八个壮年人抬着灵柩走在前面，孙玉亭和金俊山分别在两边扶着灵柩，后边是死者的嫡亲和金家户族的人。庙坪顿时响彻一片恸哭之声！ \n　　送葬队伍刚过了哭咽河的小桥，铜钱大的白雨点子就瓢泼似的倾倒下来。村里的外姓旁人都纷纷跑回家了。参加送�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>全双水村<|>GEO<|>全双水村 is a village where the
