She appeared completely unafraid and there was a look to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for no reason he could explain.\nEven the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made a warding sign in her direction. The old witch obviously was shaken by the child’s presence.\nThe Emperor cleared his throat to speak, but the child spoke first—a thin voice with traces of a soft- palate lisp, but clear nonetheless. “So here he is,” she said. She advanced to the edge of the dais. “He doesn’t appear much, does he—one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help of suspensors.”\nIt was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child that the Baron stared at her, speechless in spite of his anger. /s it a midget? he asked himself.\n“My dear Baron,” the Emperor said, “become acquainted with the sister of Muad’Dib.”\n“The sist....” The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor. “I do not understand.”\n“|, too, sometimes err on the side of caution,” the Emperor said. “It has been reported to me that your uninhabited south polar regions exhibit evidence of human activity.”\n“But that’s impossible!” the Baron protested. “The worms...there’s sand clear to the....”\n“These people seem able to avoid the worms,” the Emperor said.\nThe child sat down on the dais beside the throne, dangled her feet over the edge, kicking them. There was such an air of sureness in the way she appraised her surroundings.\nThe Baron stared at the kicking feet, the way they moved the black robe, the wink of sandals beneath the fabric.\n“Unfortunately,” the Emperor said, “I only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men. This child here was in command of one of the attacking groups.”\n“You see, Your Majesty!” the Baron said. “You see how they are!”\n“I allowed myself to be captured,” the child said. “I did not want to face my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed.”\n“Only a handful of our men got away,” the Emperor said. “Got away! You hear that?”\n“We'd have had them, too,” the child said, “except for the flames.”\n“My Sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as flame-throwers,” the Emperor said. “A move of desperation and the only thing that got them away with their three prisoners. Mark that, my dear Baron: Sardaukar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children and old men!”\n“We must attack in force,” the Baron rasped. “We must destroy every last vestige of—”\n“Silence!” the Emperor roared. He pushed himself forward on his throne. “Do not abuse my intelligence any longer. You stand there in your foolish innocence and—”\n“Majesty,” the old Truthsayer said.\nHe waved her to silence. “You say you don’t know about the activity we found, nor the fighting qualities of these superb people!” The Emperor lifted himself half off his throne. “What do you take me for, Baron?”\nThe Baron took two backward steps, thinking: /t was Rabban. He has done this to me. Rabban has....\n“And this fake dispute with Duke Leto,” the Emperor purred, sinking back into his throne. “How beautifully you maneuvered it.”\n“Majesty,” the Baron pleaded. “What are you—”\n“Silence!”\nThe old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor’s shoulder, leaned close to whisper in his ear.\nThe child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet, said: “Make him afraid some more, Shaddam. | shouldn't enjoy this, but | find the pleasure impossible to suppress.”\n“Quiet, child,” the Emperor said. He leaned forward, put a hand on her head, stared at the Baron. “Is it possible, Baron? Could you be as simpleminded as my Truthsayer suggests? Do you not recognize this child, daughter of your ally, Duke Leto?”\n“My father was never his ally,” the child said. “My father is dead and this old Harkonnen beast has never seen me before.”\nThe Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it was only to rasp: “Who?”\n“I am Alia, daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister of Duke Paul-Muad’Dib,” the child said. She pushed herself off the dais, dropped to the floor\nof the audience chamber. “My brother has promised to have your head atop his battle standard and | think he shall.”\n“Be hush, child,” the Emperor said, and he sank back into his throne, hand to chin, studying the Baron.\n“I do not take the Emperor’s orders,” Alia said. She turned, looked up at the old Reverend Mother. “She knows.”\nThe Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer. “What does she mean?”\n“That child is an abomination!” the old woman said. “Her mother deserves a punishment greater than anything in history. Death! It cannot come too quickly for that chi/d or for the one who spawned her!” The old woman pointed a finger at Alia. “Get out of my mind!”\n“T-P?” the Emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. “By the Great Mother!”\n“You don’t understand, Majesty,” the old woman said. “Not telepathy. She’s in my mind. She’s like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!”\n“What others?” the Emperor demanded. “What’s this nonsense?”\nThe old woman straightened, lowered her pointing hand. “I’ve said too much, but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us.”\n“You babble, old woman,” Alia said. “You don’t know how it was, yet you rattle on like a purblind fool.” Alia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and held it.\nThe old Reverend Mother groaned and staggered. Alia opened her eyes. “That is how it was,” she said. “A cosmic accident...and you played your part in\nit.”\nThe Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushing the air toward Alia.\n“What is happening here?” the Emperor demanded. “Child, can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another?”\n“That’s not how it is at all,” Alia said. “Unless I’m born as you, | cannot think as you.”\n“Kill her,” the old woman muttered, and clutched the back of the throne for support. “Kill her!” The sunken old eyes glared at Alia.\n“Silence,” the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. “Child, can you communicate with your brother?”\n“My brother knows I’m here,” Alia said.\n“Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?”\nAlia smiled up at him with clear innocence. “I shall not do that,” she said.\nThe Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia. “Majesty,” he pleaded, “I knew nothing of—”\n“Interrupt me once more, Baron,” the Emperor said, “and you will lose the powers of interruption... forever.” He kept his attention focused on Alia, Studying her through slitted lids. “You will not, eh?\nCan you read in my mind what l'Il do if you disobey me?”\n“I’ve already said | cannot read minds,” she said, “but one doesn’t need telepathy to read your intentions.”\nThe Emperor scowled. “Child, your cause is hopeless. | have but to rally my forces and reduce this planet to—”\n“It’s not that simple,” Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. “Ask them.”\n“It is not wise to go against my desires,” the Emperor said. “You should not deny me the least thing.”\n“My brother comes now,” Alia said. “Even an Emperor may tremble before Muad’Dib, for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him.”\nThe Emperor surged to his feet. “This play has gone far enough. | will take your brother and this planet and grind them to—”\nThe room rumbled and shook around them. There came a sudden cascade of sand behind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the Emperor’s ship. The abrupt flicker-tightening of skin pressure told of a wide-area shield being activated.\n“I told you,” Alia said. “My brother comes.”\nThe Emperor stood in front of his throne, right hand pressed to right ear, the servo-receiver there chattering its report on the situation. The Baron moved two steps behind Alia. Sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors.\n“We will fall back into space and re-form,” the Emperor said. “Baron, my apologies. These madmen are attacking under cover of the storm. We will show them an Emperor's wrath, then.” He pointed at Alia. “Give her body to the storm.”\nAs he spoke, Alia fled backward, feigning terror. “Let the storm have what it can take!” she screamed. And she backed into the Baron’s arms.\n“| have her, Majesty!” the Baron shouted. “Shall | dispatch her now-eeeeeeeeeeeh!” He hurled her to the floor, clutched his left arm.\n“l'm sorry, Grandfather,” Alia said. “You’ve met the Atreides gom Jabbar.” She got to her feet, dropped a dark needle from her hand.\nThe Baron fell back. His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left palm. “You...you....” He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open.\n“These people are insane,” the Emperor snarled. “Quick! Into the ship. We'll purge this planet of every...”\nSomething sparkled to his left. A roll of ball lightning bounced away from the wall there, crackled as it touched the metal floor. The smell of burned insulation swept through the selamlik.\n“The shield!” one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. “The outer shield is down! They....”\nHis words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the Emperor trembled and rocked.\n“They've shot the nose off our ship!” someone called.\nDust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward the outer door.\nThe Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ship’s side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. “We will make our stand here!” the Emperor ordered.\nAnother crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber admitting windblown sand and the sound of shouting. A small, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light—Alia darting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect the Emperor’s retreat.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a9a14890c899de5fa33448e1be748ec8a64cfead3d4e9f22c65a34d397061c82_v2"}
