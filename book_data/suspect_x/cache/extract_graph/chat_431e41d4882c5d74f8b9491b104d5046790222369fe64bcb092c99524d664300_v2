It had a pulse as dynamic as that of any human. It fought him, resisted, slipped away from his commands...\nA hand crept into Paul’s. He looked down to see Chani peering up at him, concern in her eyes. Those eyes drank him, and she whispered: “Please, love, do not battle with your ruh-self.” An outpouring of emotion swept upward from her hand, buoyed him.\n“Sihaya,” he whispered.\n“We must go to the desert soon,” she said in a low voice.\nHe squeezed her hand, released it, returned to the table where he remained standing.\nChani took her seat.\nlrulan stared at the papers in front of Stilgar, her mouth a tight line.\n“Irulan proposes herself as mother of the Imperial heir,” Paul said. He glanced at Chani, back to Irulan, who refused to meet his gaze. “We all know she holds no love for me.”\nlrulan went very still.\n“I know the political arguments,” Paul said. “It’s the human arguments which concern me. | think if the Princess Consort were not bound by the commands of the Bene Gesserit, if she did not seek this out of desires for personal power, my reaction might be very different. As matters stand, though, | reject this proposal.”\nlrulan took a deep, shaky breath.\nPaul, resuming his seat, thought he had never seen her under such poor control. Leaning toward her, he said: “Irulan, | am truly sorry.”\nShe lifted her chin, a look of pure fury in her eyes. “I don’t want your pity!” she hissed. And turning to Stilgar: “Is there more that’s urgent and dire?”\nHolding his gaze firmly on Paul, Stilgar said: “One more matter, m’Lord. The Guild again proposes a formal embassy here on Arrakis.”\n“One of the deep-space kind?” Korba asked, his voice full of fanatic loathing.\n“Presumably,” Stilgar said.\n“A matter to be considered with the utmost care, m’Lord,” Korba warned. “The Council of Naibs would not like it, an actual Guildsman here on Arrakis. They contaminate the very ground they touch.”\n“They live in tanks and don’t touch the ground,” Paul said, letting his voice reveal irritation.\n“The Naibs might take matters into their own hands, m’Lord,” Korba said.\nPaul glared at him.\n“They are Fremen, after all, m’Lord,” Korba insisted. “We well remember how the Guild brought those who oppressed us. We have not forgotten the way they blackmailed a spice ransom from us to keep our secrets from our enemies. They drained us of every—”\n“Enough!” Paul snapped. “Do you think / have forgotten?”\nAs though he had just awakened to the import of his own words, Korba stuttered unintelligibly, then: “M’lord, forgive me. | did not mean to imply you are not Fremen. | did not...”\n“They'll send a Steersman,” Paul said. “It isn’t likely a Steersman would come here if he could see danger in it.”\nHer mouth dry with sudden fear, Irulan said: “You’ve... seena Steersman come here?”\n“Of course | haven’t seen a Steersman,” Paul said, mimicking her tone. “But | can see where one’s been and where one’s going. Let them send us a Steersman. Perhaps | have a use for such a one.”\n“So ordered,” Stilgar said.\nAnd Irulan, hiding a smile behind her hand, thought: /t’s true then. Our Emperor cannot see a Steersman. They are mutually blind. The conspiracy is hidden.\nOnce more the drama begins.\n—THE EMPEROR PAUL MUAD’DIB ON HIS ASCENSION TO THE LION THRONE\nlia peered down from her spy window into the great reception hall to watch the advance of the Guild entourage.\nThe sharply silver light of noon poured through clerestory windows onto a floor worked in green, blue and eggshell tiles to simulate a bayou with water plants and, here and there, a splash of exotic color to indicate bird or animal.\nGuildsmen moved across the tile pattern like hunters stalking their prey in a strange jungle. They formed a moving design of gray robes, black robes, orange robes—all arrayed in a deceptively random way around the transparent tank where the Steersman-Ambassador swam in his orange gas. The tank slid on its supporting field, towed by two gray-robed attendants, like a rectangular ship being warped into its dock.\nDirectly beneath her, Paul sat on the Lion Throne on its raised dais. He wore the new formal crown with its fish and fist emblems. The jeweled golden robes of state covered his body. The shimmering of a personal shield surrounded him. Two wings of bodyguards fanned out on both sides along the dais and down the steps. Stilgar stood two steps below Paul’s right hand in a white robe with a yellow rope fora belt.\nSibling empathy told her that Paul seethed with the same agitation she was experiencing, although she doubted another could detect it. His attention remained on an orange-robed attendant whose blindly staring metal eyes looked neither to right nor to left. This attendant walked at\nthe right front corner of the Ambassador’s troupe like a military outrider. A rather flat face beneath curly black hair, such of his figure as could be seen beneath the orange robe, every gesture shouted a familiar identity.\nIt was Duncan Idaho.\nIt could not be Duncan Idaho, yet it was.\nCaptive memories absorbed in the womb during the moment of her mother’s spice change identified this man for Alia by a rihani decipherment which cut through all camouflage. Paul was seeing him, she knew, out of countless personal experiences, out of gratitudes and youthful sharing.\nIt was Duncan.\nAlia shuddered. There could be only one answer: this was a Tleilaxu ghola, a being reconstructed from the dead flesh of the original. That original had perished saving Paul. This could only be a product of the axolotl tanks.\nThe ghola walked with the cock-footed alertness of a master swordsman. He came to a halt as the Ambassador’s tank glided to a stop ten paces from the steps of the dais.\nIn the Bene Gesserit way she could not escape, Alia read Paul’s disquiet. He no longer looked at the figure out of his past. Not looking, his whole being stared. Muscles strained against restrictions as he nodded to the Guild Ambassador, said: “I am told your name is Edric. We welcome you to our Court in the hope this will bring new understanding between us.”\nThe Steersman assumed a sybaritic reclining pose in his orange gas, popped a melange capsule into his mouth before meeting Paul’s gaze. The tiny transducer orbiting a corner of the Guildsman’s tank reproduced a coughing sound, then the rasping, uninvolved voice: “I abase myself before my Emperor and beg leave to present my credentials and offer a small gift.”\nAn aide passed a scroll up to Stilgar, who studied it, scowling, then nodded to Paul. Both Stilgar and Paul turned\nthen toward the ghola standing patiently below the dais.\n“Indeed my Emperor has discerned the gift,” Edric said.\n“We are pleased to accept your credentials,” Paul said. “Explain the gift.”\nEdric rolled in the tank, bringing his attention to bear on the ghola. “This is a man called Hayt,” he said, spelling the name. “According to our investigators, he has a most curious history. He was killed here on Arrakis . . . a grievous head-wound which required many months of regrowth. The body was sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School. It came to our attention that this must be Duncan Idaho, the trusted retainer of your household. We bought him as a gift befitting an Emperor.” Edric peered up at Paul. “Is it not Idaho, Sire?”\nRestraint and caution gripped Paul’s voice. “He has the aspect of Idaho.”\nDoes Paul see something | don’t? Alia wondered. No! It’s Duncan!\nThe man called Hayt stood impassively, metal eyes fixed straight ahead, body relaxed. No sign escaped him to indicate he knew himself to be the object of discussion.\n“According to our best knowledge, it’s Idaho,” Edric said.\n“He’s called Hayt now,” Paul said. “A curious name.”\n“Sire, there’s no divining how or why the Tleilaxu bestow names,” Edric said. “But names can be changed. The Tleilaxu name is of little importance.”\nThis ts a Tleilaxu thing, Paul thought. There’s the problem. The Bene Tleilax held little attachment to phenomenal nature. Good and evil carried strange meanings in their philosophy. What might they have incorporated in Idaho’s flesh—out of design or whim?\nPaul glanced at Stilgar, noted the Fremen’s superstitious awe. It was an emotion echoed all through his Fremen guard. Stilgar’s mind would be speculating about the loathsome habits of Guildsmen, of Tleilaxu and of gholas.\nTurning toward the ghola, Paul said: “Hayt, is that your only name?”\nA serene smile spread over the ghola’s dark features. The metal eyes lifted, centered on Paul, but maintained their mechanical stare. “That is how | am called, my Lord: Hayt.”\nIn her dark spy hole, Alia trembled. It was Idaho’s voice, a quality of sound so precise she sensed its imprint upon her cells.\n“May it please my Lord,” the ghola added, “if | say his voice gives me pleasure. This is a sign, say the Bene Tleilax, that | have heard the voice... . before.”\n“But you don’t know this for sure,” Paul said.\n“I know nothing of my past for sure, my Lord. It was explained that | can have no memory of my former life. All that remains from before is the pattern set by the genes. There are, however, niches into which once-familiar things may fit. There are voices, places, foods, faces, sounds, actions—a sword in my hand, the controls of a ’thopter.. .”\nNoting how intently the Guildsmen watched this exchange, Paul asked: “Do you understand that you’re a gift?”\n“It was explained to me, my Lord.”\nPaul sat back, hands resting on the arms of the throne.\nWhat debt do I owe Duncan’s flesh? he wondered. The man died saving my life. But this is not Idaho, this is a ghola. Yet, here were body and mind which had taught Paul to fly a ‘thopter as though the wings grew from his own shoulders. Paul knew he could not pick up a sword without leaning on the harsh education Idaho had given him. A ghola. This was flesh full of false impressions, easily misread. Old associations would persist. Duncan Idaho. It wasn’t so much a mask the ghola wore as it was a loose, concealing garment of personality which moved in a way different from whatever the Tleilaxu had hidden here.\n“How might you serve us?” Paul asked.\n“In any way my Lord’s wishes and my capabilities agree.”\nAlia, watching\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_431e41d4882c5d74f8b9491b104d5046790222369fe64bcb092c99524d664300_v2"}
