A mixed lot: some aspirants to supreme power. Angelika there smiling so prettily. Some waiting (not even daring to hope yet) but gathering what they could.\n“Our Sisterhood was acting with stupidity,” Murbella accused. She noted the ones who took this angrily. “You would have killed the goose!”\nThey did not understand. She dredged up the parable. They listened with proper attention, even when she added: “Don’t you realize how desperately we need every one of these witches? We outnumber them so greatly that each of them will carry an enormous teaching burden!”\nThey considered this and, bitter though it was, they were forced to a qualified acceptance because she said it.\nMurbella hammered it home. “Not only am I your Great Honored Matre ... Does anyone question that?”\nNo one questioned.\n“but | am Bene Gesserit Mother Superior. They can do little else but confirm me in office.”\nTwo of them started to protest but Murbella cut them Short. “No! You would be powerless to enforce your will on\nthem. You would have to kill them all. But they will obey me.”\nThe two continued to babble and she shouted them down: “Compared to me with what | acquired from them, the lot of you are miserable weaklings! Do any of you challenge that?”\nNo one challenged but orange flecks were there.\n“You are children with no knowledge of what you might become,” she said. “Would you return defenseless to face the ones of many faces? Would you become vegetables?”\nThat caught their interest. They were accustomed to this tone from older commanders. The content held them now. It was difficult to accept from one so young... still... the things she had done. And to Logno and her aides!\nMurbella saw them admire the bait.\nFertilization. This group will carry it away with them. Hybrid vigor. We are fertilized to grow stronger. And flower. And go to seed? Best not dwell on that. Honored Matres will not see it until they are almost Reverend Mothers. Then they will look back angrily as I did. How could we have been that stupid?\nShe saw submission take shape in councillors’ eyes. There would be a honeymoon. Honored Matres would be children in a candy store. Only gradually would the inevitable grow plain to them. Then they would be trapped.\nAs | was trapped. Don’t ask the oracle what you can gain. That’s the trap. Beware the real fortune teller! Would you like thirty-five hundred years of boredom?\nOdrade Within objected.\nGive the Tyrant some credit. It couldn’t all have been boredom. More like a Guild Navigator picking his passage through foldspace. Golden Path. An Atreides paid for your survival, Murbella.\nMurbella felt burdened. The Tyrant’s payment dumped on her shoulders. / didn’t ask him to do it for me.\nOdrade could not let that pass. He did it nonetheless.\nSorry, Dar. He paid. Now, | must pay.\nSo you are a Reverend Mother at last!\nThe councillors had grown restive under her stare.\nAngelika elected to speak for them. After all, | am first chosen.\nWatch that one! A blaze of ambition in her eyes.\n“What response are you asking us to take with these witches?” Alarmed by her own boldness. Was not Great Honored Matre also a witch now?\nMurbella spoke softly. “You will tolerate them and offer them no violence whatsoever.”\nAngelika was emboldened by Murbella’s mild tone. “Is that Great Honored Matre’s decision or the—”\n“Enough! | could bloody the floor of this room with the lot of you! Do you wish to test it?”\nThey did not wish to test it.\n“And what if | say to you that it is Mother Superior speaking? You will ask do | have a policy to meet our problem? | will say: Policy? Ahh, yes. | have a policy for unimportant things such as insect infestations. Unimportant things call for policies. For such of you as do not see the wisdom in my decision, | need no policy. Your kind | dispose of quickly. Dead before you know you've been injured! That is my response to the presence of filth. Is there any filth in this room?”\nIt was language they recognized: the lash of the Great Honored Matre backed by ability to kill.\n“You are my Council,” Murbella said. “I expect wisdom from you. The least you can do is pretend you are wise.”\nHumorous sympathy from Odrade: /f that’s the way Honored Matres give and take orders, it won’t require much deep analysis by Bell.\nMurbella’s thoughts went elsewhere. / am no longer Honored Matre.\nThe step from one to another was so recent she found her Honored Matre performance uncomfortable. Her\nadjustments were a metaphor of what would happen to her former Sisters. A new role and she did not wear it well. Other Memory simulated long association with herself as this new person. This was no mystical transubstantiation, merely new abilities.\nMerely?\nThe change was profound. Did Duncan realize this? It pained her that he might never see through to this new person.\nIs that the residue of my love for him?\nMurbella drew back from her questions, not wanting an answer. She felt repelled by something that went deeper than she cared to burrow.\nThere will be decisions | must make that love would prevent. Decisions for the Sisterhood and not for myself. That is where my fear is pointing.\nImmediate necessities restored her. She sent her councillors away, promising pain and death if they failed to learn this new restraint.\nNext, Reverend Mothers must be taught a new diplomacy: getting along with no one—not even with each other. It would grow easier in time. Honored Matres slipping into Bene Gesserit ways. One day, there would be no Honored Matres; only Reverend Mothers with improved reflexes and augmented knowledge of sexuality.\nMurbella felt haunted by words she had heard but not accepted until this moment. “The things we will do for Bene Gesserit survival have no limits.”\nDuncan will see this. | cannot keep it from him. The Mentat will not hold to a fixed idea of what | was before the Agony. He opens his mind as I open a door. He will examine his net. “What have I caught this time?”\nWas this what happened to Lady Jessica? Other Memory carried Jessica threaded into the warp and woof of Sharings. Murbella unraveled a bit and paraded elder knowledge.\nHeretic Lady Jessica? Malfeasance in office?\nJessica had plunged into love as Odrade had plunged into the sea and the resultant waves had all but engulfed the Sisterhood.\nMurbella sensed this taking her where she did not want to go. Pain clutched her chest.\nDuncan! Ohhhh, Duncan! She dropped her face into her hands. Dar, helo me. What am I to do?\nNever ask why you're a Reverend Mother.\nI must! The progression is clear in my memory and...\nThat’s a sequence. Thinking of it as cause and effect beguiles you away from totality.\nTao?\nSimpler: You are here.\nBut Other Memory goes back and back and...\nImagine it’s pyramids—interlocked.\nThose are just words!\nIs your body still functioning?\n/ hurt, Dar. You don’t have a body anymore and it’s useless to...\nWe occupy different niches. The pains | felt are not your pains. My joys are not yours.\n| don’t want your sympathy! Ohh, Dar! Why was I born?\nWere you born to lose Duncan?\nDar, please!\nSo you were born and now you know that’s never enough. So you became an Honored Matre. What else could you do? Still not enough? Now you're a Reverend Mother. You think that’s enough? It’s never enough as long as you're alive.\nYou're telling me I must always reach beyond myself.\nPah! You don’t make decisions on that basis. Didn’t you hear him? Don’t think; do it! Will you choose the easy way? Why should you feel sad because you’ve encountered the inevitable? If that’s all you can see, confine yourself to improving the breed!\nDamn you! Why did you do this to me?\nDo what?\nMake me see myself and my former Sisters this way!\nWhat way?\nDamn you! You know what I mean!\nFormer Sisters, you say?\nOh, you are insidious.\nAll Reverend Mothers are insidious.\nYou never stop teaching!\nIs that what I do?\nHow innocent | was! Asking you what you really do.\nYou know as well as I do. We wait for humankind to mature. The Tyrant only provided them time to grow but now they need care.\nWhat’s the Tyrant have to do with my pain?\nYou foolish woman! Did you fail the Agony?\nYou know I didn’t!\nStop stumbling over the obvious.\nOh, you bitch!\n| prefer witch. Either is preferable to whore.\nThe only difference between Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre is the marketplace. You married our Sisterhood.\nOur Sisterhood?\nYou bred for power! How is that different from...\nDon't twist it, Murbella! Keep your eyes on survival.\nDon't tell me you had no power.\nTemporary authority over people intent on survival.\nSurvival again!\nIn a Sisterhood that promotes the survival of others. Like the married woman who bears children.\nSo it comes down to procreation.\nThat’s a decision you make for yourself: family and what binds it. What tickles life and happiness?\nMurbella began to laugh. She dropped her hands and opened her eyes to find Bellonda standing there watching.\n“That’s always a temptation for a new Reverend Mother, Bellonda said. “Chat a bit with Other Memory. Who was it this time? Dar?”\n”\nMurbella nodded.\n“Don’t trust anything they give you. It’s lore and you judge it for yourself.”\nOdrade’s words exactly. Look through the eyes of the dead at scenes long gone. What a peep show!\n“You can get lost in there for hours,” Bellonda said. “Exercise restraint. Be sure of your ground. One hand for yourself and one for the ship.”\nThere it was again! The past applied to the present. How rich Other Memory made everyday life.\n“It'll pass,” Bellonda said. “It gets to be old hat after a time.” She laid a report in front of Murbella.\nOld hat! One hand for yourself and one for the ship. So much just in idioms.\nMurbella leaned back in the slingchair to scan Bellonda’s report, fancying herself suddenly in Odrade’s idiom: Spider Queen in the center of my web. The web might be a bit frayed just now but it was still there catching things to be digested. Twitch a trigger strand and Bell came running, mandibles flexing in anticipation. The twitch-words were “Archives” and “Analysis.”\nSeeing Bellonda in this light, Murbella saw the wisdom in the ways Odrade had employed her, flaws as valuable as the strengths. When Murbella finished the report, Bellonda still stood there in characteristic attitude.\nMurbella recognized that Bellonda looked on all who Summoned her as ones who had not measured up, people who called on Archives for frivolous reasons and had to be set straight. Frivolity: Bellonda’s béte noire. Murbella found this amusing.\nMurbella kept amusement masked while enjoying Bellonda. The way to deal with her was to be scrupulous. Nothing to subtract from strengths. This report was a model of concise and pertinent argument.
