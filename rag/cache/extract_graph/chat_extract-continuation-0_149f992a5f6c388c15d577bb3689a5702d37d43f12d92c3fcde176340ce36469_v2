Will you... 1 mean, | could arrange...”\n“No! The boy was right. I’m not his father.”\n“I’m sorry,” Siona whispered. “I should not have done this.”\n“Why did he choose this place?” Idaho asked.\n“The father... your...”\n“My predecessor!”\n“Because this was Irti’s home and she would not leave. That is what people said.”\n“Irti... the mother?”\n“Wife, by the old rite, the one from the Oral History.”\nIdaho looked around at the stone fronts of the buildings which enclosed the square, the curtained windows, the narrow doors. “So he lived here?”\n“When he could.”\n“How did he die, Siona?”\n“Truly, | do not know... but the Worm has killed others. We know that for sure!”\n“How do you know it?” He centered a probing stare on her face. The intensity of it forced her to look away.\n“I do not doubt the stories of my ancestors,” she said. “They are told in bits and pieces, a note here, a whispered account there, but | believe them. My father believes them, too!”\n“Moneo has said nothing to me of this.”\n“One thing you can say about the Atreides,” she said. “We're loyal and that’s a fact. We keep our word.”\nIdaho opened his mouth to speak, closed it without making a sound. Of course! Siona, too, was Atreides. The thought shook him. He had known it, but he had not accepted it. Siona was some kind of a rebel, a rebel whose actions were almost sanctioned by Leto. The limits of his permission were unclear, but Idaho sensed them.\n“You must not harm her,” Leto had said. “She is to be tested.”\nIdaho turned his back on Siona.\n“You don’t know anything for sure,” he said. “Bits and pieces, rumors!”\nSiona did not respond.\n“He’s an Atreides!” Idaho said.\n“He’s the Worm!” Siona said and the venom in her voice was almost palpable.\n“Your damned Oral History is nothing but a bunch of ancient gossip!” Idaho accused. “Only a fool would believe it.”\n“You still trust him,” she said. “That will change.”\nIdaho whirled and glared at her.\n“You’ve never talked to him!”\n“I have. When | was a child.”\n“You're still a child. He’s all of the Atreides who were, all of them. It’s a terrible thing, but | knew those people. They were my friends.”\nSiona only shook her head.\nAgain, Idaho turned away. He felt that he had been wrung dry of emotion. He was spiritually boneless. Without willing it, he began walking across the square and up the street where the boy had gone. Siona came running after him and fell into step, but he ignored her.\nThe street was narrow, enclosed by the one-story stone walls, the doors set back within arched frames, all of the doors closed. The windows were small versions of the doors. Curtains twitched as he passed.\nAt the first cross-street, Idaho stopped and looked to the right where the boy had gone. Two gray-haired women in long black skirts and dark green blouses stood a few paces away down the street, gossiping with their heads close together. They fell silent when they saw Idaho and stared at him with open curiosity. He returned their stare, then looked down the side-street. It was empty.\nIdaho turned toward the women, passed them within a pace. They drew closer together and turned to watch him. They looked only once at Siona, then returned their attention to Idaho. Siona moved quietly beside him, an odd expression on her face.\nSadness? he wondered. Regret? Curiosity?\nIt was difficult to say. He was more curious about the doorways and windows they were passing.\n“Have you ever been to Goygoa before?” Idaho asked.\n“No.” Siona spoke in a subdued voice, as though afraid of it.\nWhy am I walking down this street? Idaho wondered. Even as he asked himself the question, he knew the answer. This\nwoman, this Irti: What kind of a woman would bring me to Goygoa?\nThe corner of a curtain on his right lifted and Idaho saw a face—the boy from the square. The curtain dropped then was flung aside to reveal a woman standing there. Idaho stared speechlessly at her face, stopped in a completed step. It was the face of a woman known only to his deepest fantasies—a soft oval with penetrating dark eyes, a full and sensuous mouth...\n“Jessica,” he whispered.\n“What did you say?” Siona asked.\nIdaho could not answer. It was the face of Jessica resurrected out of a past he had believed gone forever, a genetic prank—Muad’Dib’s mother recreated in new flesh.\nThe woman closed the curtain, leaving the memory of her features in Idaho’s mind, an after-image which he knew he could never remove. She had been older than the Jessica who had shared their dangers on Dune—age-lines beside the mouth and eyes, the body a bit more full...\nMore motherly, \\daho told himself. Then: Did I ever tell her... who she resembled?\nSiona tugged at his sleeve. “Do you wish to go in, to meet her?”\n“No. This was a mistake.”\nIdaho started to turn back the way they had come, but the door of Irti’s house was flung open. A young man emerged and closed the door behind him, turning then to confront Idaho.\nIdaho guessed the youth’s age at sixteen and there was no denying the parentage—that karaku/ hair, the strong features.\n“You are the new one,” the youth said. His voice had already deepened into manhood.\n“Yes.” Idaho found if difficult to speak.\n“Why have you come?” the youth asked.\n“It was not my idea,” Idaho said. He found this easier to say, the words driven by resentment against Siona.\nThe youth looked at Siona. “We have had word that my father is dead.”\nSiona nodded.\nThe youth returned his attention to Idaho. “Please go away and do not return. You cause pain for my mother.”\n“Of course,” Idaho said. “Please apologize to the Lady Irti for this intrusion. | was brought here against my will.”\n“Who brought you?”\n“The Fish Speakers,” Idaho said.\nThe youth nodded once, a curt movement of the head. He looked once more at Siona. “I always thought that you Fish Speakers were taught to treat your own more kindly.” With that, he turned and reentered the house, closing the door firmly behind him.\nIdaho turned back the way they had come, grabbing Siona’s arm as he strode away. She stumbled, then fell into step, disengaging his grasp.\n“He thought | was a Fish Speaker,” she said.\n“Of course. You have the look.” He glanced at her. “Why didn’t you tell me that Irti was a Fish Speaker?”\n“It didn’t seem important.”\n“Oh.”\n“That’s how they met.”\nThey came to the intersection with the street from the square. Idaho turned away from the square, striding briskly up to the end where the village merged into gardens and orchards. He felt insulated by shock, his awareness recoiling from too much that could not be assimilated.\nA low wall blocked his path. He climbed over it, heard Siona follow. Trees around them were in bloom, white flowers with orange centers where dark brown insects worked. The air was full of insect buzzing and a floral scent which reminded Idaho of jungle flowers from Caladan.\nHe stopped when he reached the crest of a hill where he could turn and look back down at Goygoa’s rectangular neatness. The roofs were flat and black.\nSiona sat down on the thick grass of the hilltop and embraced her knees.\n“That was not what you intended, was it?” Idaho asked.\nShe shook her head and he saw that she was close to tears.\n“Why do you hate him so much?” he asked.\n“We have no lives of our own!”\nIdaho looked down at the village. “Are there many villages like this one?”\n“This is the shape of the Worm’s Empire!”\n“What’s wrong with it?”\n“Nothing—if that’s all you want.”\n“You're saying that this is all he allows?”\n“This, a few market cities . .. Onn. I’m told that even planetary capitals are just big villages.”\n“And | repeat: What’s wrong with that?”\n“It’s a prison!”\n“Then leave it.”\n“Where? How? You think we can just get on a Guild ship and go anywhere else, anywhere we want?” She pointed down toward Goygoa where the 'thopter could be seen off to one side, the Fish Speakers seated on the grass nearby. “Our jailers won’t let us leave!”\n“They leave,” Idaho said. “They go anywhere they want.”\n“Anywhere the Worm sends them!”\nShe pressed her face against her knees and spoke, her voice muffled. “What was it like in the old days?”\n“It was different, often very dangerous.” He looked around at the walls which set off pastureland, gardens and orchards. “Here on Dune, there were no imaginary lines to Show the limits of ownership on the land. It was all the Dukedom of the Atreides.”\n“Except for the Fremen.”\n“Yes. But they knew where they belonged—on this side of a particular escarpment... or beyond where the pan turns white against the sand.”\n“They could go wherever they wanted!”\n“With some limits.”\n“Some of us long for the desert,” she said.\n“You have the Sareer.”\nShe lifted her head to glare at him. “That little thing!”\n“Fifteen hundred kilometers by five hundred—not so little.”\nSiona got to her feet. “Have you asked the Worm why he confines us this way?”\n“Leto’s Peace, the Golden Path to insure our survival. That’s what he says.”\n“Do you know what he told my father? | spied on them when I was a child. | heard him.”\n“What did he say?”\n“He said he denies us most crises, to limit our forming forces. He said: ‘People can be sustained by affliction, but | am the affliction now. Gods can become afflictions.’ Those were his words, Duncan. The Worm is a sickness!”\nIdaho did not doubt the accuracy of her recital, but the words failed to stir him. He thought instead of the Corrino he had been ordered to kill. Affliction. The Corrino, descendant of a Family which once had ruled this Empire, had been revealed as a softly fat middle-aged man who hungered after power and conspired for spice. Idaho had ordered a Fish Speaker to kill him, an act which had aroused Moneo to a fit of intense questioning.\n“Why didn’t you kill him yourself?”\n“| wanted to see how the Fish Speakers performed.”\n“And your judgment of their performance?”\n“Efficient.”\nBut the death of the Corrino had inflicted Idaho with a sense of unreality. A fat little man lying in a pool of his own blood, an undistinguished shadow among the night shadows\nof a plastone street. It was unreal. Idaho could remember Muad’Dib saying: “The mind\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a rebel and a member of the Atreides family, involved in testing and questioning the rule of Leto>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a recurring character, loyal to the Atreides, currently interacting with Siona and questioning her motives>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto II, the God Emperor, also known as the Worm, rules the empire with a strict regime>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IRTI<|>PERSON<|>Irti is the wife of Idaho's predecessor and mother to his children, living in Goygoa>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOYGOA<|>GEO<|>A village where Irti and her family live, characterized by stone buildings and narrow streets>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>A planet from Idaho's past, known for its jungle flowers>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>The desert planet, central to the Atreides legacy and the setting of the story>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An all-female military and religious order serving Leto>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ruling family, with a long history of leadership and conflict>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ORAL HISTORY<|>EVENT<|>A collection of stories and accounts passed down, often referenced by Siona>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>LETO<|>Siona is a rebel against Leto's rule, testing the limits of his tolerance<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>LETO<|>Idaho serves Leto but questions his methods and the confinement of people<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>SIONA<|>Idaho interacts with Siona, questioning her motives and beliefs<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IRTI<|>GOYGOA<|>Irti lives in Goygoa, where she raised her family<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>IRTI<|>Idaho meets Irti, who resembles Jessica from his past<|>4>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Siona is mistaken for a Fish Speaker, indicating their influence<|>3>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>The Fish Speakers serve Leto as his enforcers and supporters<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>DUNE<|>Idaho reflects on the past of Dune and its significance to the Atreides<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>ORAL HISTORY<|>Siona references the Oral History to justify her beliefs and actions<|>6>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
