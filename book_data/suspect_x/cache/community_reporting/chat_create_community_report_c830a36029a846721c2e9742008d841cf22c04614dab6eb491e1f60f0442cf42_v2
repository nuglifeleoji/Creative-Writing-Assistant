Serving as the heart of their domain, it is a near-closed ecological circle designed to sustain the order's activities. The region features significant drylands, ochre-tinged air from dust storms, and unseasonably cold weather, creating a harsh yet controlled environment.  \n\nCENTRAL houses key facilities such as the Reserved Dining Room, where leaders like Odrade dine and interact with others, as well as her workroom and the no-ship. It is also the site of critical meetings, discussions, and inspections, where Odrade scrutinizes operations for signs of inefficiency or complacency. The urban area includes \"\"The Way,\"\" a major thoroughfare, and supports plantations and orchards vital for morale and sustenance.  \n\nAdditionally, CENTRAL serves as a logistical and ceremonial center, hosting burials and other Bene Gesserit rituals near the ship.

The planet is a serene and pleasant habitat, though it is undergoing significant environmental transformation as the Bene Gesserit deliberately desertify portions of the landscape to accommodate sandworms and replicate the conditions of Dune, ensuring the continued production of spice.  \n\nAs the Sisterhood’s central hub, Chapterhouse is where critical decisions are made, strategic plans are formulated, and key events unfold, including negotiations, farewells, and power consolidations—such as Murbella’s return to assert control. It also serves as a site for evolutionary experiments and houses significant assets like the last great sandworm and the no-ship. However, the planet faces ecological collapse due to its rapid desertification, alongside external threats, particularly from the Honored Matres.  \n\nDespite these challenges, Chapterhouse remains the heart of Bene Gesserit operations, where they maintain a deep ecological and symbiotic relationship with their environment.
