富坚在当时结了婚，据跟他很熟的人表示，富坚离婚后似乎还对前妻纠缠不放。\n    前妻带了个孩子，要查出两人的居住地点对调查人来说不是难事，很快就查出那对母女――花冈靖子和美里的住处。地点在江东区森下，也就是现在草S他们正要去的地方。\n    “真不想接这个差事，好倒霉。”岸谷叹息着说道。\n    “怎么，跟我去打听案情有这么倒霉吗？”\n    “不是啦，人家母女俩好端端地安静过日子，我只是不想去打扰她们。”\n    “只要跟案子无关，就不会打扰到她们的。”\n    “不见得吧，听说富坚好像是相当恶劣的坏丈夫、坏父亲，她们应该连想都不愿再想起吧？”\n    “这样的话，她们应该更欢迎我们，因为我们带来了坏男人死掉的好消息。总之你别这样苦着脸了，否则连我都会跟着泄气。――噢，好像就是这里。”草S在老旧的公寓前驻足。\n    建筑物本身呈现脏脏的灰色，墙上有几处修补的痕迹。共有两层，上下各四个房间，现在亮着灯的大约只占了半数。\n    “二零四号室，这么说是在二楼喽。”草S走上楼梯，岸谷也尾随在后。\n     二零四号室距离楼梯最远，门旁的窗口射出灯光。草S松了一口气，如果不在家就得改天再跑一趟了，他并未通知对方今晚要来访。\n    他按下门铃，室内立刻传来有人走动的声响，锁开了门也开了，不过门上依然挂着链子。既然是母女相依为命，这种程度的谨慎是理所当然。\n    从门缝彼端，有一名女子正讶异地仰望草S二人。大大的黑眼珠令人印象深刻，是个脸蛋小巧的女人，看起来年纪轻轻不到三十岁，但草S立刻发觉那是因为灯光昏暗，握着门把的手背分明属于家庭主妇。\n    “不好意思，请问是花冈靖子小姐吗？”草S尽量让表情和语气柔和一点。\n    “我就是。”她露出不安的眼神。\n    “我们是警视厅的人，有个消息想通知您。”草S取出警用手册，给对方看大头照的部分，一旁的岸谷也有样学样。\n    “警察……”靖子睁大了眼睛，大大的黑眼珠游移不定.\n    “可以打扰一下吗？”\n    “啊，好。”花冈靖子先把门关上，卸下门链后，重新打开。“请问，到底是什么事？”草S向前一步，脚踏进门内，岸谷也跟着效法。\n    “您认识富坚慎二先生吧？”\n    靖子微微一僵的表情并未逃过草S的眼睛，但那或许该解释为，是因为突然听到警察提起前夫的名字。\n    “是我前\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>富坚慎二<|>PERSON<|>富坚慎二 is a
