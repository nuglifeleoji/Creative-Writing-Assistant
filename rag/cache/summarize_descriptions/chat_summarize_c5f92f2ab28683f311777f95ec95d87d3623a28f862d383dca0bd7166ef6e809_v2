He played a significant role in Hwi Noree's creation, upbringing, and training, shaping her understanding of **Leto II**, the God Emperor. Malky had a contentious yet strangely symbiotic relationship with Leto, marked by both antagonism and mutual fascination. While he was a **rogue** and **cruel** individual, described as a \"terrible man,\" Leto enjoyed his company, valuing his wit and originality.  \n\nMalky's relationship with Leto was multifaceted: he openly opposed the God Emperor, mocked his authority, and was suspected of orchestrating attacks against him. Despite this, he engaged in deep philosophical discussions with Leto, exploring themes such as the soul, invention, and the destructive potential of novelty. Malky believed Leto sought originality but feared its consequences, insights that influenced Hwi Noree's perspective.  \n\nHis tenure as an ambassador ended when he was **removed from Leto's court**, an act that fueled his resentment. Malky was known for his **flippant and taunting demeanor**, as well as his interactions with Leto's **Fish Speakers**, which further complicated his standing. Eventually, his defiance and possession of dangerous secrets led to his **elimination**, orchestrated by Leto and executed by **Moneo**.  \n\nMalky's arrival often provoked concern or interest, underscoring his reputation as a **dangerous and unpredictable figure**. Though despised by many, his intellectual provocations and unique rapport with Leto made him a memorable adversary.
