He is portrayed as a caring man who has a deep bond with his pet black cat, which he mourns after its death, highlighting themes of loss and isolation in his life. Despite celebrating his 65th birthday and enjoying moments with family, he grapples with feelings of loneliness, especially after the passing of his daughter, 晓霞.\n\n徐国强's character is marked by his attempts to guide and persuade younger family members, particularly 润叶, regarding marriage proposals, which adds to the romantic pressures surrounding her. He is depicted as a figure of wisdom, providing insights into the responsibilities of leadership and family obligations, while also feeling the weight of his own health issues and the solitude of living alone in a small apartment.\n\nHis past connections, including those with 徐治功 and 张有智, suggest a network of relationships that may aid in resolving familial issues. 徐国强's life is a blend of joy and sorrow, as he navigates the complexities of family gatherings, the responsibilities of being a father-in-law, and the emotional toll of loss. He enjoys simple pleasures, such as receiving gifts of tobacco and sharing tea with friends, yet he remains acutely aware of his loneliness and the changes that have come with age.\n\nIn summary, 徐国强 is a multifaceted character who represents the older generation's struggles and joys, embodying themes of family, loss, and the passage of time.

Currently, 福军 is away attending a meeting in the region, indicating that he is engaged in activities that may be related to his political or professional responsibilities.\n\nIn addition to his familial ties, 福军 is also involved in a conflict with other characters, suggesting that his presence in the story is not merely passive but rather active and potentially contentious. This conflict may stem from his political position, which is described as difficult, hinting at challenges he faces in navigating the complexities of his role within the family and the broader social or political landscape.\n\n田福堂, another character in the narrative, intends to consult 福军 in the city regarding his daughter's future. This indicates that 福军 is viewed as a figure of authority or influence, whose opinions and decisions could significantly impact the direction of 田福堂's daughter's life. The consultation suggests a level of trust and reliance on 福军's judgment, further emphasizing his importance in the familial and social context.\n\nOverall, 福军 is portrayed as a multifaceted character whose relationships and conflicts are central to the unfolding narrative.
