殿中浓重的阴影融为一体，那张苍白的脸仿佛是浮在虚空中。\n　　“这是伏羲。”纣王对刚进来的周文王和汪淼介绍那位黑衣人，仿佛他们一直就在那儿似的，而黑衣人才是新来的。“他认为，太阳是脾气乖戾的大神，他醒着的时候喜怒无常，是乱纪元；睡着时呼吸均匀，是恒纪元，伏曦建议竖起了外面的那些大摆，日夜不停地摆动，声称这对太阳神有强烈的催眠作用，能使其陷入漫长的昏睡。但直到现在，我们看到太阳神仍醒着，最多只是不时打打盹儿。”\n　　纣王挥了一下手，有人端来一个陶罐，放到伏羲面前的小石台上——汪淼后来知道，那是一罐调味料。伏曦长叹一声，端起陶罐喝下去，那咕咚咕咚的声音仿佛黑暗深处有一颗硕大的心脏在跳动喝了一半后，他将剩下的调味料倒在身上，然后扔下陶罐，走向大殿角落的一口架在火上的青铜大鼎，爬上鼎沿；他跳进大鼎，激起了一大团蒸气。\n　　“姬昌坐下，一会儿就开宴。”纣王指指那口大鼎说。\n　　“愚蠢的巫术。”周文王朝大鼎偏了下头，轻蔑地说。\n　　“你对太阳悟出了什么？”纣王问，火光在他的双眸中跳动。\n　　“太阳不是大神，太阳是阳，黑夜是阴，世界是在阴阳平衡中运转的，这不在我们的控制之中，但可以预测。”周文王说着，抽出青铜剑，在火炬照到的地板上画出了一对大大的阴阳鱼，然后以令人目眩的速度在周围画出了六十四卦，看上去如同火光中时隐时现的大年轮，“大王，这就是宇宙的密码，借助它，我将为您的王朝献上一部精确的万年历。”\n　　“姬昌啊，我现在急需知道的，是下一个长恒纪元什么时候到来。”\n　　“我将立刻为您占卜。”周文王说着，走到阴阳鱼中央盘腿坐下，抬头望着大殿的顶部，目光仿佛穿透了厚厚的金字塔看到了星空，他的双手手指同时在进行着复杂的运动，组合成一部高速运转的计算器。寂静中，只有大鼎中的汤发出咕嘟咕嘟的声响，仿佛煮在汤中的巫师在梦呓。\n　　周文王从阴阳图中站起来，头仍仰着，说：“下面将是一段为期四十一天的乱纪元；然后将出现为期五天的恒纪元，接下来是为期二十三天的乱纪元和为期十八天的恒纪元，然后是为期八天的乱纪元，当这段乱纪元结束后，大王，您所期待的长恒纪元就到来了，这个恒纪元将持续三年零九个月，其间气候温暖，是一个黄金纪元。”\n######################\nOutput:",
