It stands in stark contrast to the surrounding desert, symbolizing the transformative changes brought by **Leto II's** rule. The forest is bordered by the **Sareer** and is visible from **Moneo's workroom**, emphasizing its proximity to Leto's city.  \n\nA place of both ecological and symbolic significance, the Forbidden Forest is filled with the scents of **resin and damp duff**, and its terrain is marked by **moon shadows**. It is home to **Leto's symbolic D-wolves**, which patrol the area, guarding the Sareer and pursuing runners. The forest has been a site of **rebel attacks**, adding to its dangerous reputation.  \n\nThe forest holds deep personal meaning for **Siona Atreides**, who once endured a desperate run through its depths and made a solemn oath at the edge of a river. This event underscores the forest's role as a place of trial and transformation.  \n\nMentioned in the context of the **Royal Road**, the Forbidden Forest is a recurring landmark in the narratives of Arrakis, blending natural beauty with lurking peril. Its lush greenery against the harsh desert backdrop serves as a testament to Leto's engineered ecological shifts, making it a powerful symbol of his reign.\",6\n1246,IDAHO RIVER,\"The **Idaho River** is a significant geographical and symbolic feature on the planet Rakis, closely tied to the legacy of Duncan Idaho and the reign of the Tyrant Leto II. It served as a key landmark along the Royal Road, near which confrontations with the Museum Fremen occurred, and was crossed by a faery bridge as part of a journey's route. Flowing near the settlement of Onn, the river shares its name with Duncan Idaho, reflecting his enduring influence.  \n\nThe Idaho River flowed southward beyond the Sareer's boundary wall, visible under moonlight and audible through the ground, suggesting its presence was both seen and felt. For Kwuteg, it represented a sanctuary, symbolizing safety from the predatory D-wolves. Duncan Idaho himself reflected upon the river during a conversation with Moneo, noting its tamed nature within the Sareer region. Siona later crossed it to escape a wolf pack, marking the boundary of the Forbidden Forest.  \n\nThe river was also a man-made waterway, flowing through a canyon, embodying the planet's transformation under Leto II's rule. However, its fate shifted dramatically over time. Once a vital feature on Rakis, it eventually vanished, leaving only dry remnants near the Sareer. It was here that the Tyrant met his end, falling from his bridge into what was once the riverbed.  \n\nDespite contradictions in its state—described both as flowing and later dry—the Idaho River's significance remains clear. It was a place of passage, conflict, and reflection, deeply intertwined with the planet's history and the figures who shaped it. Whether as a sanctuary, a boundary, or a symbol of Leto's rule, the Idaho River played a pivotal role in the events of Rakis before its eventual disappearance.\",9\n1460,IXIAN MACHINES,\"Ancient technology mentioned as having created the Idaho River's watercourse.\"\"\",1\n1345,ROYAL PLANTATIONS,\"Agricultural fields beyond the Forbidden Forest.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2796,FORBIDDEN FOREST,ARRAKIS,The Forbidden Forest is located on the planet Arrakis.,124\n3060,IDAHO RIVER,FORBIDDEN FOREST,The forest is located near the Idaho River.,15\n3370,IDAHO RIVER,IXIAN MACHINES,The Idaho River was created by Ixian machines,10\n3063,FORBIDDEN FOREST,ROYAL PLANTATIONS,The plantations are located beyond the forest.,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
