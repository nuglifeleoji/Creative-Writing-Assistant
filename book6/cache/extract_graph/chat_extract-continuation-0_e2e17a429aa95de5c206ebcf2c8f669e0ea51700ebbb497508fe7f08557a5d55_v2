�了，哈勃二号现在还在测试中。”\n　　“你们在为军方工作，只需执行命令。”\n　　“这里除您之外没有军人，我们只按NASA 的测试计划执行。”\n　　“博士，你们不可以就用那个目标做测试吗？”将军的口气软了下来。\n　　“测试目标是经过严密选择的，有各种距离和亮度种类，测试计划是按照最经济的方式制定的，使得望远镜的指向只旋转一趟就可完成全部测试，而现在观察三体世界，就需要把指向转动近30 度角再转回去。将军，转动那个大家伙是要耗费推进剂的，我们在为军方省钱。”\n　　“那就看看你们是怎么省的吧，这是我刚从你们的电脑上发现的。”斐兹罗说着，把背着的手拿到前面来，手中拿着一张上面已经打印出图像的纸，那图像是一张照片，是从上方俯拍的，有一群人在兴奋地向上仰望，很容易认出他们就是现在控制室中的这批人，林格站在正中间，还有三位搔首弄姿的外来女士，可能是他们中某三位的女朋友。照片中人们站的位置显然是控制室的楼顶，图像十分清晰，像是在十几米高处拍的，与普通照片不同的是，这幅照片中叠印着一大堆复杂的参数标注。“博士，你们站的是楼顶的最高处了，那里不会有一个那种拍电影的摇臂吧？如果说把哈勃二号转动30 度要花钱。那你们转动360 度要花多少？况且这一百多亿的投资好像不是用来从太空为你们和女朋友拍写真的，要不要我把这笔钱算到各位的账单上？”\n　　“将军，您的命令当然是必须执行的。”林格赶紧说，工程师们也立刻忙了起来。\n　　目标数据库中的坐标数据被很快调出，太空中，那个直径二十多米长上百米的圆柱体开始缓缓转动，控制室中的大屏幕上，星空的图像开始平移。\n　　“这就是望远镜看到的吗？”将军问。\n　　“不，这只是定位系统传回的图像，望远镜传回的是静态照片，需经处理后才能看到。”\n　　五分钟后，星空的平移停止了，控制系统报告定位已经完成。又过了五分钟，林格说：“好了，返回原测试位置吧。”。\n　　斐兹罗惊奇地问：“怎么，已经完成了？”\n　　“是的，现在观测图像正在传辅处理中。”\n　　“不能多拍几张吗？”\n　　“将军，已经在不同的焦距范围内拍摄了210 张。”这时第一张观测图像处理完成，林格指着显示器说，“将军，看吧，这就是您渴望看到的敌人的世界。”\n　　斐兹罗只看到一片漆黑的背景上的三团光晕，很模糊，像雾夜中的街灯，这就是决定两个文明命运的那三颗恒星。\n　　“看来真的看不到行星了。”斐兹罗掩盖不住自己的失望。\n　　“当然看不到，即使将来直径百米的哈勃三号建成，也只有在三体行星运行到少数特定位置时才能观测到，而且能分辨的只是一个点\n######################\nOutput:",
