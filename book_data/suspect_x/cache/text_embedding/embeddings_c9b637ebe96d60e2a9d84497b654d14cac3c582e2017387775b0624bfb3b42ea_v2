words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.\nPaul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now—everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.\n“Yeah,” Scarface said. “No need to fight over....”\nHis hand flashed toward the pilot’s neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet’s chest.\nScarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.\n“Thought | was some dummy didn’t know that trick,” Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\n“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.\n“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.\nCzigo hesitated.\n“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked. “Give the boy a chance.” Her lip curled in a sneer. “Little enough chance he’d have out there in that sand. Give him that and....” She smiled. “You could find yourself well rewarded.”\nCzigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. “I’ve heard me what can happen to a man in this desert,” he said. “Boy might find the knife a kindness.”\n“Is it so much | ask?” Jessica pleaded.\n“You're trying to trick me,” Czigo muttered.\n“I don’t want to see my son die,” Jessica said. “Is that a trick?”\nCzigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. “What’ll y’ do, cub, if | cut y’r bonds?”\n“He'll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,” Jessica said.\n“Is that what y’ll do, cub?” Czigo asked.\nPaul’s voice was properly surly. “Yes.”\nThe knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot.\nThe toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft part of Czigo’s abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the man’s heart.\nWith one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing\nwith a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.\n“I could’ve handled him,” she said. “He’d have had to cut my bindings. That was a foolish risk.”\n“I saw the opening and used it,” he said.\nShe heard the harsh control in his voice, said: “Yueh’s house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.”\nHe looked up, saw the curling symbol.\n“Get out and let us study this craft,” she said. “There’s a bundle under the pilot’s seat. | felt it when we got in.”\n“Bomb?”\n“Doubt it. There’s something peculiar here.”\nPaul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo’s feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot’s blood.\nWaste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.\nPaul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the ‘thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another ‘thopter swooping toward them, realized they’d not\nhave time to clear the bodies out of this ’thopter and escape. “Run, Paul!” Jessica shouted. “It’s Harkonnens!”\nArrakis teaches the attitude of the knife—chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: “Now, it’s complete because it’s ended here.”\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nman in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at\nthe end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes’ body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh.\nSardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the Emperor’s own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform, there’s no disguising them.\n“You're Yueh,” the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctor’s hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh’s eyes.\n“lam Yueh,” the Doctor said.\n“You can relax, Yueh,” the man said. “When you dropped the house shields we came right in. Everything’s under control here. Is this the Duke?”\n“This is the Duke.”\n“Dead?”\n“Merely unconscious. | suggest you tie him.”\n“Did you do for these others?” He glanced back down the hall where Mapes’ body lay.\n“More’s the pity,” Yueh muttered.\n“Pity!” the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto.\n“So that’s the great Red Duke.”\nIf | had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought. Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Dukes.\nThe Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto’s uniform. “Little souvenir,” he said. “Where’s the ducal signet ring?”\n“He doesn’t have it on him,” Yueh said.\n“I can see that!” the Sardaukar snapped.\nYueh stiffened, swallowed. /f they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they'll find out about the ring, about the ‘thopter | prepared—all will fail.\n“Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as Surety that an order came directly from him,” Yueh said.\n“Must be damned trusted messengers,” the Sardaukar muttered.\n“Aren't you going to tie him?” Yueh ventured.\n“How long’ll he be unconscious?”\n“Two hours or so. | wasn’t as precise with his dosage as | was for the woman and boy.”\nThe Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. “This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?”\n“About ten minutes.”\n“So soon?”\n“I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.”\n“So he will. You’ll wait outside, Yueh.” He shot a hard glance at Yueh. “Now!”\nYueh glanced at Leto. “What about....”\n“He'll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven.” Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh’s forehead. “You’re known; you'll be safe enough in the halls. We’ve no more time for chit-chat, traitor. | hear the others coming.”\nTraitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.\nHe passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform.\nHarkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames.\n“It’s the traitor,” Someone said.\n“The Baron will want to see you soon,” another said.\nI must get to the 'thopter, Yueh thought. / must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it. And fear struck him: /f Idaho suspects me or grows impatient— if he doesn’t wait and go exactly where I told him—\nJessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage. lIl be denied even the smallest relief from my act.\nThe Harkonnen guard released his arm, said “Wait over there out of the way.”\nAbruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the Smallest pity. /daho must not fail!\nAnother guard bumped into him, barked: “Stay out of the way, you!”\nEven when they’ve profited by me they despise me, Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.\n“Wait for the Baron!” a guard officer snarled.\nYueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into Shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the ‘thopter waited—the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother.\nA guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room.\nHow confident they were!\nYueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the ‘thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.\nSoftly, Yueh closed the ‘thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees.\nNow, it is done, he thought.\nOnce more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron—he will encounter a small tooth.\nThere is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.\n—FROM “INTRODUCTION TO A CHILD’S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport\nof the grounded lighter he was using as a command post.

Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination—and the Duke’s men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.\nThe Baron could feel the distant chomping—a drumbeat carried to him through the ship’s metal: broomp...broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!\nWho would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke’s men would run for those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.\nHe adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls.\nA pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke’s, he thought. He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.\nA door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-blackened viewport before turning.\nPiter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Baron’s personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheeplike in his presence.\nThe Baron turned.\nPiter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. “Good news, m’Lord. The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.”\n“Of course they have,” the Baron rumbled.\nHe studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter’s effeminate face. And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.\nSoon | must remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then—they will welcome my darling Feyd- Rautha as a savior.\nThe Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain—Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe—a man to be trusted because the captain’s vices were known.\n“First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?” the Baron asked. “I must give the traitor his reward.”\nPiter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.\nA bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron.\n“Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.”\n“M’Lord Harkonnen.”\n“You've given us the Duke, | hear.”\n“My half of the bargain, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron looked at Piter.\nPiter nodded.\nThe Baron looked back at Yueh. “The letter of the bargain, eh? And l....” He spat the words out: “What was | to do in return?”\n“You remember quite well, m’Lord Harkonnen.”\nAnd Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron’s manner. Wanna was indeed dead—gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there’d still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron’s manner showed there was no hold; it was ended.\n“Do |?” the Baron asked.\n“You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.”\nThe Baron nodded. “Oh, yes. Now, | remember. So | did. That was my promise. That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn’t endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter’s pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises. | told you I’d free her from the agony and permit you to join her. So be it.” He waved a hand at Piter.\nPiter’s blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was Catlike in its sudden fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh’s back.\nThe old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron.\n“So join her!” the Baron spat.\nYueh stood, swaying. His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: “You...think...you...de...feated...me. You... think...|...did...not...know...what...|...bo0ught...for... my...Wanna.”\nHe toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling.\n“So join her,” the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.\nYueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.\nSo that’s how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. /t’s well to know.\n“He did give us the Duke?” the Baron asked.\n“Of a certainty, my Lord,” Piter said.\n“Then get him in here!”\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.\nThe Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones.\n“I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,” the Baron said. “Not even a traitor | created.”\nHe glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron’s mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain white.\nBut there was still the feeling of doubt.\nWhat had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he’d probably known what would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he’d been defeated: “You think you defeated me.”\nWhat had he meant?\nThe Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains, the eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke’s eyes held a glazed, insane look.\n“Wel-I-I-I,” the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long-envisioned, had lost some of its Savor.\nDamn that cursed doctor through all eternity!\n“I believe the good Duke is drugged,” Piter said. “That’s how Yueh caught him for us.” Piter turned to the Duke. “Aren’t you drugged, my dear Duke?”\nThe voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.\n“What of the woman and the boy, Piter?” the Baron asked. “Any word yet?”\nPiter’s tongue darted over his lips.\n“You've heard something!” the Baron snapped. “What?”\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. “The men who were sent to do the job, m’Lord —they’ve...ah...been...ah...found.”\n“Well, they report everything satisfactory?”\n“They're dead, m’Lord.”\n“Of course they are! What | want to know is—”\n“They were dead when found, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron’s face went livid. “And the woman and boy?”\n“No sign, m’Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being investigated. Perhaps it’s as we wished—an accident. Possibly—”\n“We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing ‘thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?”\n“One of the Duke’s men obviously escaped in it, m’Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped.”\n“Which of the Duke’s men?”\n“It was a Clean, silent killing, m’Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant.”\n“Possibilities,” the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke.\n“The situation is in hand, m’Lord,” Piter said.\n“No, it isn’t! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?”\n“We've word where to find him and he’s been sent for, m’Lord.”\n“I don’t like the way the Emperor’s servant is helping us,” the Baron muttered.\nThey were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto’s mind. Woman and boy —no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.\n“Where is the ducal signet ring?” the Baron demanded. “His finger is bare.”\n“The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,” the guard captain said.\n“You killed the doctor too soon,” the Baron said. “That was a mistake. You should’ve warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.” He scowled. “Possibilities!”\nThe thought hung like a sine wave in Leto’s mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it.\nThe tooth!\nHe remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.\nSomeone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it.\nNot yet!\nThe someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn't remember.\n“How long will he remain drugged like this?” the Baron asked.\n“Perhaps another hour, m’Lord.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. “I am hungry.”\nThat’s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room", "ibilities!”\nThe thought hung like a sine wave in Leto’s mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain.

Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. “I am hungry.”\nThat’s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness and faded.\nTime became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. / must wait.\nThere was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.\n“I believe he’s coming around, Baron.”\nA silky voice, that one. That was Piter.\n“So | see, Piter.”\nA rumbling basso: the Baron.\nLeto sensed increasing definition in his Surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.\nAnd he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man’s hands: compulsive touchings—the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl.\nLeto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.\n“You can hear me, Duke Leto,” the Baron said. “l know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.”\nNo sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. /t’s true, then: they don’t have Paul and Jessica.\n“This is not a child’s game we play,” the Baron rumbled. “You must know that.” He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this could not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see royalty in such straits—it set a bad precedent.\nLeto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped capsule within that tooth—the poison gas—he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth.\nYueh.\nDrug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto’s mind. He knew it had been Yueh.\n“Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?” the Baron asked.\nLeto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone’s agony.\n“We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen,” the Baron said. “We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them. I’ve lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?”\nLeto felt fear tighten his chest. /f Yueh sent them to the desert fold...the search won't stop until they're found.\n“Come, come,” the Baron said. “We don’t have much time and pain is quick. Please don’t bring it to this, my dear Duke.” The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto’s shoulder. “Piter doesn’t have all his tools here, but I’m sure he could improvise.”\n“Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.”\nThat silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.\n“You had an emergency plan,” the Baron said. “Where have your woman and the boy been sent?” He looked at Leto’s hand. “Your ring is missing. Does the boy have it?”\nThe Baron looked up, stared into Leto’s eyes.\n“You don’t answer,” he said. “Will you force me to do a thing | do not want to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. | agree they’re sometimes the best, but it’s not good that you should be subjected to such things.”\n“Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids,” Piter said. “Perhaps on other portions of the body. It’s especially effective when the subject doesn’t know where the tallow will fall next. It’s a good method and there’s a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?”\n“Exquisite,” the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.\nThose touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands—their compulsive wandering.\nThe sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke’s nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?\n“Believe me, cher cousin,” the Baron said. “I do not want it to come to this.”\n“You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,” Piter said. “There’s an artistry in this, you know.”\n“You're a superb artist,” the Baron growled. “Now, have the decency to be silent.”\nLeto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had Said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: “‘And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea...and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.’”\n“We waste time, Baron,” Piter said.\n“Perhaps.”\nThe Baron nodded. “You know, my dear Leto, you'll tell us in the end where they are. There’s a level of pain that'll buy you.”\nHe’s most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth...and the fact that I truly don’t know where they are.\nThe Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.\n“Observe this prize person who denies he’s for hire,” the Baron said. “Observe him, Piter.”\nAnd the Baron thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he’d rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?\nThe frog sounds in the background stopped.\nThe Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across the room, shake his head. The captive hadn’t produced the needed information. Another failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft fool who didn’t realize how much hell there was so near him—only a nerve’s thickness away.\nThis thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a Surgeon exercising endless Supple scissor dissections—cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath.\nRabbits, all of them!\nAnd how they cowered when they saw the Carnivore!\nLeto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end it all quickly. Still—it had been good, much of this life. He found himself remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell- blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on Arrakis—colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.\n“Too bad,” the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood up lightly in his Suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke. He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.\nHow he fears me! the Baron thought.\nShocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear—the silky-voiced one: Piter.\nIt got him, too!\n“Piter! What’s wrong?”\nThe rumbling voice was far away.\nLeto sensed memories rolling in his mind—the old toothless mutterings of hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes—blue within blue, the eyes—all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.\nThere was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery —so distant—a roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every... silence.\nOne thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.\nSilence.\nThe Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had Slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?\nSounds returned to him...and reason. He heard someone shouting orders—gas masks...keep a door closed...get blowers going.\nThe others fell quickly, he thought. /’m still standing. I’m still breathing. Merciless hell! That was close!\nHe could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been pushing himself away from the table...that and Piter’s Shocked gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.\nChance and the warning in a dying man’s gasp— these had saved him.\nThe Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And that stupid guard captain! He’d said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Baron’s presence! How had it been possible for the Duke...? No warning. Not even from the poison Snooper over the table—until it was too late. How?\nWell, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.\nHe grew aware of more activity down the hall— around the corner at the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for the Baron’s reaction.\nWould the Baron be angry?\nAnd the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.\nSome of the guards had weapons leveled at the door.
