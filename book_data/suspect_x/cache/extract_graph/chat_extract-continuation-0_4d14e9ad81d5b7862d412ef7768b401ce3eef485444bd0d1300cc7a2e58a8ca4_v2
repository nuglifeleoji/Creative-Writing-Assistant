There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now—everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.\n“Yeah,” Scarface said. “No need to fight over....”\nHis hand flashed toward the pilot’s neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet’s chest.\nScarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.\n“Thought | was some dummy didn’t know that trick,” Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\n“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.\n“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.\nCzigo hesitated.\n“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked. “Give the boy a chance.” Her lip curled in a sneer. “Little enough chance he’d have out there in that sand. Give him that and....” She smiled. “You could find yourself well rewarded.”\nCzigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. “I’ve heard me what can happen to a man in this desert,” he said. “Boy might find the knife a kindness.”\n“Is it so much | ask?” Jessica pleaded.\n“You're trying to trick me,” Czigo muttered.\n“I don’t want to see my son die,” Jessica said. “Is that a trick?”\nCzigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. “What’ll y’ do, cub, if | cut y’r bonds?”\n“He'll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,” Jessica said.\n“Is that what y’ll do, cub?” Czigo asked.\nPaul’s voice was properly surly. “Yes.”\nThe knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot.\nThe toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft part of Czigo’s abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the man’s heart.\nWith one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing\nwith a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.\n“I could’ve handled him,” she said. “He’d have had to cut my bindings. That was a foolish risk.”\n“I saw the opening and used it,” he said.\nShe heard the harsh control in his voice, said: “Yueh’s house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.”\nHe looked up, saw the curling symbol.\n“Get out and let us study this craft,” she said. “There’s a bundle under the pilot’s seat. | felt it when we got in.”\n“Bomb?”\n“Doubt it. There’s something peculiar here.”\nPaul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo’s feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot’s blood.\nWaste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.\nPaul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the ‘thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another ‘thopter swooping toward them, realized they’d not\nhave time to clear the bodies out of this ’thopter and escape. “Run, Paul!” Jessica shouted. “It’s Harkonnens!”\nArrakis teaches the attitude of the knife—chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: “Now, it’s complete because it’s ended here.”\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nman in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at\nthe end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes’ body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh.\nSardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the Emperor’s own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform, there’s no disguising them.\n“You're Yueh,” the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctor’s hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh’s eyes.\n“lam Yueh,” the Doctor said.\n“You can relax, Yueh,” the man said. “When you dropped the house shields we came right in. Everything’s under control here. Is this the Duke?”\n“This is the Duke.”\n“Dead?”\n“Merely unconscious. | suggest you tie him.”\n“Did you do for these others?” He glanced back down the hall where Mapes’ body lay.\n“More’s the pity,” Yueh muttered.\n“Pity!” the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto.\n“So that’s the great Red Duke.”\nIf | had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought. Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Dukes.\nThe Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto’s uniform. “Little souvenir,” he said. “Where’s the ducal signet ring?”\n“He doesn’t have it on him,” Yueh said.\n“I can see that!” the Sardaukar snapped.\nYueh stiffened, swallowed. /f they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they'll find out about the ring, about the ‘thopter | prepared—all will fail.\n“Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as Surety that an order came directly from him,” Yueh said.\n“Must be damned trusted messengers,” the Sardaukar muttered.\n“Aren't you going to tie him?” Yueh ventured.\n“How long’ll he be unconscious?”\n“Two hours or so. | wasn’t as precise with his dosage as | was for the woman and boy.”\nThe Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. “This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?”\n“About ten minutes.”\n“So soon?”\n“I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.”\n“So he will. You’ll wait outside, Yueh.” He shot a hard glance at Yueh. “Now!”\nYueh glanced at Leto. “What about....”\n“He'll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven.” Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh’s forehead. “You’re known; you'll be safe enough in the halls. We’ve no more time for chit-chat, traitor. | hear the others coming.”\nTraitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.\nHe passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform.\nHarkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames.\n“It’s the traitor,” Someone said.\n“The Baron will want to see you soon,” another said.\nI must get to the 'thopter, Yueh thought. / must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it. And fear struck him: /f Idaho suspects me or grows impatient— if he doesn’t wait and go exactly where I told him—\nJessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage. lIl be denied even the smallest relief from my act.\nThe Harkonnen guard released his arm, said “Wait over there out of the way.”\nAbruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the Smallest pity. /daho must not fail!\nAnother guard bumped into him, barked: “Stay out of the way, you!”\nEven when they’ve profited by me they despise me, Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.\n“Wait for the Baron!” a guard officer snarled.\nYueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into Shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the ‘thopter waited—the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother.\nA guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room.\nHow confident they were!\nYueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the ‘thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.\nSoftly, Yueh closed the ‘thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees.\nNow, it is done, he thought.\nOnce more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron—he will encounter a small tooth.\nThere is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.\n—FROM “INTRODUCTION TO A CHILD’S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport\nof the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work.\nExplosive artillery.\nThe guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke’s fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination—and the Duke’s men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is the son of Jessica and a key figure in the events, demonstrating combat skills and strategic thinking in a life-threatening situation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is Paul's mother, using her wit and persuasion to protect her son and navigate dangerous circumstances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CZIGO<|>PERSON<|>Czigo is a guard who threatens Paul and Jessica, ultimately being defeated by Paul's combat skills)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCARFACE<|>PERSON<|>Scarface is a guard who is incapacitated by Czigo during the confrontation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUEH<|>PERSON<|>Yueh is a doctor who is perceived as a traitor, involved in the capture of Duke Leto and attempting to save Paul and Jessica)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON VLADIMIR HARKONNEN<|>PERSON<|>The Baron is a powerful antagonist orchestrating the attack on the Atreides family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>PERSON<|>Duke Leto is the father of Paul and a central figure in the conflict, captured and possibly killed by the Harkonnens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARDaukar<|>PERSON<|>Sardaukar are elite soldiers of the Emperor, involved in the attack on the Atreides)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>GEO<|>Arrakeen is the city on Arrakis where the events take place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is the desert planet where the story unfolds, known for its harsh environment and valuable spice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIELD WALL<|>GEO<|>The Shield Wall is a geographical feature on Arrakis where the Duke's men make their last stand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is the ancestral home of the Atreides family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Harkonnens are a powerful family and the primary antagonists in the conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atreides are a noble family targeted by the Harkonnens in a political and military conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTACK ON ATREIDES<|>EVENT<|>The attack is a coordinated assault by the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to eliminate the Atreides family)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>JESSICA<|>Paul is the son of Jessica, and they work together to survive the attack<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CZIGO<|>Paul defeats Czigo in combat to protect himself and his mother<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>CZIGO<|>Jessica attempts to persuade Czigo to spare Paul, showing her protective nature<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUEH<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>Yueh is involved in the capture of Duke Leto, perceived as a traitor<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUEH<|>PAUL<|>Yueh attempts to save Paul by hiding the ducal signet in the 'thopter<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUEH<|>JESSICA<|>Yueh attempts to save Jessica by hiding the ducal signet in the 'thopter<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON VLADIMIR HARKONNEN<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>The Baron orchestrates the attack and capture of Duke Leto<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON VLADIMIR HARKONNEN<|>HARKONNEN<|>The Baron is the leader of the Harkonnen family<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>ATREIDES<|>Duke Leto is the leader of the Atreides family<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARDaukar<|>EMPEROR<|>The Sardaukar are elite soldiers loyal to the Emperor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>ARRAKIS<|>Arrakeen is a city on the planet Arrakis<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATREIDES<|>CALADAN<|>The Atreides family's ancestral home is on Caladan<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARKONNEN<|>ATTACK ON ATREIDES<|>The Harkonnens are the primary force behind the attack on the Atreides<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARDaukar<|>ATTACK ON ATREIDES<|>The Sardaukar participate in the attack on the Atreides<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
