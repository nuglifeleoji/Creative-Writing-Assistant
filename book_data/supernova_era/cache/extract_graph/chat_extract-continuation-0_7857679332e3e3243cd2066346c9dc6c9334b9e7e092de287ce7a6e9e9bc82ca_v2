“刑警会来，是因为听说有客人为了见你才会买便当，所以来打听到底是哪个客人。他好像是从工藤先生那里听来的。”\n    “工藤先生？”\n    怎会扯上他呢？简直难以理解。\n    “我仔细想想，以前好像的确和工藤先生说过，有客人为了见你，每天早上都来光顾。工藤先生好像把这件事告诉刑警了。”\n    原来如此，靖子恍然大悟。刑警去找工藤后，为了确认他的话所以又去了“天亭”。\n    “结果你怎么回答？”\n    “我想否认也很奇怪所以就老实说了，我说就是住在你隔壁的老师。不过我有特别声明，我说那个老师专程来看你，只是我们夫妻私下的猜测，是真是假我也不确定。”\n    靖子感到口中干渴，警方终于盯上石神了。只是因为听了工藤的话吗？或是另有什么理由，才会盯上他？\n    “喂？靖子？”小代子喊她。\n    “啊，是。”\n    “我这样说，应该没关系吧？不会给你造成麻烦吧？”\n    是很麻烦――这话她死也不能说。\n    “说的也是，总之我就是想告诉你这件事。”\n    “我知道了，谢谢你特地打电话来。”\n    靖子挂断电话，感到胃沉甸甸地揪成一团，有点想吐。\n    这种感觉一直持续到回家。半路上，她去超市买菜，可是买了些什么，连自己都不太记得。\n\n    听到隔壁开门关门的声音时，石神正坐在电脑前。萤幕上映出三张照片，是拍摄工藤的两张，和靖子走入饭店的一张。本来想拍下两人一起的镜头，可是他怕这次一定会被工藤发现，况且万一让靖子发觉也很麻烦，所以只好作罢。\n    石神已想好最坏的打算，到时这几张照片应该会派上用场，不过他还是想极力避免让情况演变到那种地步。\n    石神瞥了一眼桌上的钟然后起身，快八点了。看来靖子和工藤会面的时间似乎不长，他很清楚这点令自己大为安心。\n    他把电话放进口袋，走出房间。像以往一样步上夜路，小心确认有没有被人跟踪。\n    石神想起草S这名刑警，他的来意着实奇妙。虽然他嘴上问着花冈靖子的事，但石神总觉得他主要的目的是想打听汤川学。他们到底是怎么谈论的？石神无法判断自己是否遭到怀疑，令他难以做出下一个决定。\n    他在惯用的那个公用电话打靖子的手机。响到第三声时，她接起电话。\n    “是我。”石神说，“现在，方便说话吗？”\n    “可以。”\n    “今天有什么状况吗？”\n    他很想问她和工藤见面谈了些什么，却找不到适当说法。石神会知道他们两人\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
