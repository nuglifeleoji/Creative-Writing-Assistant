\n　　胖胖的张有智摸了摸自己的短头发，想了一下，说：“我基本同意你的意见。不过，现在这形势，把人一放了事，怕说不过去。干脆这样！咱们也不说这些人没问题，但这些问题让他们通过政治夜校或毛泽东思想学习班来解决，不要再劳教这些人，让他们做个检查，再让大家批判一下他们的‘资本主义倾向’就行了……”张主任说着，就被他的这些话把自己先逗笑了。 \n　　刘志祥也笑了，说：“张主任这办法好。他文龙也不好说什么！” \n　　田福军没笑，考虑了一下，也只好同意了有智的意见。这时，刘志祥突然叫道：“啊呀，你看我这人！光在这说话，都忘记给你两个安排饭了！叫我赶快到灶房去说一声！”刘志祥正准备走，田福军挡住他说：“志祥你不要忙饭！你也不要给我和有智专意安排，你们吃什么，我们随便吃一点就行了。等文龙回来，和他谈过以后，我们晚上争取再赶到石圪节去。罢了我们还要回柳岔来……” \n　　张有智问刘志祥：“刚才你办公窑里那个妇女哭什么哩？”刘志祥说：“这是刘坪店来的一个民工，有妇女病，要请假回去，文龙不批准，她就又跑来找我。文龙不放话，我也不敢批准……” \n　　“让她回去！”田福军说。 \n　　“那好！让我现在就过去让她走！”刘志祥说着就出去了。 \n　　不一会，那个妇女竟然哭得泪水满面跑过来，对田福军和张有智说：“啊呀呀，我咋盼到包文正了，我再一世都忘不了你们两个青天大老爷……” \n　　田福军和张有智苦笑着，劝慰这个妇女赶快到医院去看她的病…… \n　　那妇女走后，刘志祥就带着他俩去隔壁公社灶上吃饭。 \n　　他们进入灶房后，见两个炊事员正忙着揭蒸笼。房子里还有一个胖老头，不象是炊事员，穿一身干净的中式黑卡叽布棉衣，头上拢一条新白毛巾，正拿着个大瓷碗，把菜锅里的肉片子挑拣着往自己的碗里捞。 \n　　刘志祥悄悄对县上的两位领导说：“这是文龙的父亲……一个钱也不掏，常到公社灶上来吃饭，比在他家里都随便……” \n　　两位县上的领导惊讶地看着这位穿黑棉衣的农民，心里都涌上一种说不出的愤慨。周文龙限制别人的“资产阶级法权”，可他自己却搞真正的“资产阶级法权”！他把别的农民打得死去活来，却让自己的农民父亲一分钱也不出，在公社的锅里挑肥拣瘦地大吃二喝！ \n　　那位穿黑棉袄的“太上皇”如入无人\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
