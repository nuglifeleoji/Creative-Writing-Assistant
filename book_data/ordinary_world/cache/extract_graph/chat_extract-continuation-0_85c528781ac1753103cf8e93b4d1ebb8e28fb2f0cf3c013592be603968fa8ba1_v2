\n　　在以后的日子时，村里一些男人不时出现在她破败的院落，这些人有老有小，大都是光棍。 \n　　她的另一种灾难开始了。 \n　　这些酸眉醋眼的男人你来我往，坐在她的炕栏上，厚颜无耻地说些不堪入耳的骚情话尤其是一个叫毛蛋的老光棍，还殷勤地给她担水扫地，强制性地坐在她的灶火圪崂里，帮她拉风箱。天黑时，如果不是她摔盆掼碗表示出厌恶，毛蛋是不会离开她家的。 \n　　郝红梅知道毛蛋是企图在她这里得到什么。 \n　　不！他们的企图不会得逞。她需要男人，但不需要这种男人。 \n　　她发愁的是，她对这些人的纠缠无可奈何。她总不能把这些斜眉吊眼的家伙用棍子打出她的家门。她鼓不起这种勇气。在农村，处理这种局面自有许多为难之处。这些人都是同村邻居，有的还是她死去丈夫的长辈。如果他们还没动手动脚，只说些八杆子打不着的骚情话，她只能在容颜上表示自己的愤怒而别无它法。但这些死皮赖脸的家伙又根本不在乎她的容颜，只管到她这里来“串门子”。 \n　　红梅的生活陷入了新的困境。夜晚，她有时还能听见院子里传来令人心惊的脚步声。她不得不在门叉子里别上切菜的刀…… \n　　炎热的夏天来临之后，郝红梅便格外地繁忙起来。 \n　　一大早，她就做好了两顿饭。家里吃一顿，饭罐里提一顿，然后引着孩子一整天都泡在地里。 \n　　中午她不回家。母子俩在地里吃完饭，找个阴凉处睡一会，又继续开始干活。儿子也有他自己的“营生”——刨土窑窑。 \n　　沉重的劳动使她双手打满了血泡。血泡又被锄把磨成了硬茧。那张原本俏丽的脸庞，被毒火似的太阳烤晒得又红又黑。少女时期的娇艳荡然无存，看起来就象秋天北方山野里一株朴素的红高粱。毫无疑问，她早就成了真正的劳动妇女。 \n　　但是，心灵的凄苦和劳动的折磨，仍然没能改变她身上那种漂亮女人的诱人魅力，现在，她那苗条丰满的身体更给人一种健康的美感。直到如今，她仍然保持着上学时的卫生习惯，牙齿刷得雪白，内衣经常换洗得干干净净；一身灰土之中，散发出芬芳的香皂味。 \n　　不用说，在农村庄稼人的眼里，郝红梅是个“洋婆姨”。那些老小光棍们提起她来，就象提起他们永远\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>郝红梅<|>PERSON<|>郝红梅 is a woman living in a rural
