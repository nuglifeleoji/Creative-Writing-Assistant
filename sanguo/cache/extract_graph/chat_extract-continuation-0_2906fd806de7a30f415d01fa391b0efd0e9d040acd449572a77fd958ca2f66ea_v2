表到许都，曹操在邺郡闻知玄德自立汉中王，大怒曰：“织席小儿，安敢如此！吾誓灭之！”即时传令，尽起倾国之兵，赴两川与汉中王决雌雄。一人出班谏曰：“大王不可因一时之怒，亲劳车驾远征。臣有一计，不须张弓只箭，令刘备在蜀自受其祸；待其兵衰力尽，只须一将往征之，便可成功。”操视其人，乃司马懿也。操喜问曰：“仲达有何高见？”懿曰：“江东孙权，以妹嫁刘备，而又乘间窃取回去；刘备又据占荆州不还：彼此俱有切齿之恨。今可差一舌辩之士，赍书往说孙权，使兴兵取荆州；刘备必发两川之兵以救荆州。那时大王兴兵去取汉川，令刘备首尾不能相救，势必危矣。”操大喜，即修书令满宠为使，星夜投江东来见孙权。\n\n    权知满宠到，遂与谋士商议。张昭进曰：“魏与吴本无仇；前因听诸葛之说词，致两家连年征战不息，生灵遭其涂炭。今满伯宁来，必有讲和之意，可以礼接之。”权依其言，令众谋士接满宠入城相见。礼毕，权以宾礼待宠。宠呈上操书，曰：“吴、魏自来无仇，皆因刘备之故，致生衅隙。魏王差某到此，约将军攻取荆州，魏王以兵临汉川，首尾夹击。破刘之后，共分疆土，誓不相侵。”孙权览书毕，设筵相待满宠，送归馆舍安歇。权与众谋士商议。顾雍曰：“虽是说词，其中有理。今可一面送满宠回，约会曹操，首尾相击；一面使人过江探云长动静，方可行事。”诸葛瑾曰：“某闻云长自到荆州，刘备娶与妻室，先生一子，次生一女。其女尚幼，未许字人。某愿往与主公世子求婚。若云长肯许，即与云长计议共破曹操；若云长不肯，然\n######################\nOutput:",
