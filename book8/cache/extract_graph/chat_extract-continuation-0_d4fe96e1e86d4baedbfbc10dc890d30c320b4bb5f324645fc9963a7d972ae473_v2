叶灵瞳有些发蒙，赶忙走上前去。然后她就看到，平时盛放早饭的餐盘中空空如也，一干二净。\n\n    蓝轩宇此时被人群围住了，他自己也是一脸羞惭的样子，也不回嘴，就那么站在那里。\n\n    “怎么回事?”叶灵瞳看到了常剑逸，下意识地问道。\n\n    常剑逸看了她一眼，道：“我们早上来的时候，早饭都没了。蓝轩宇说，他不小心都给吃了。他说昨晚上没吃饭，所以特别饿，一下就吃多了。”\n\n    “啊?”那可是三十个人的分量啊！他一个人，都给吃了？\n\n    蓝轩宇也看到了叶灵瞳，嘴角动了一下，他自己也不知道该怎么解释。事实上，他半夜就饿醒了。\n\n    醒了以后，之前的恶心和眩晕都消失了，取而代之的是一种前胸贴后背的饥饿感。\n\n    所以，他早早地就等在食堂门外，食堂一开门，他就第一个冲进来，大吃特吃起来。\n\n    似乎是真的饿坏了，也可能是因为昨天消耗太大，他自己都没注意，只是一个个餐盘吃过去，然后就都给吃了……他平时就吃得多，但好歹还不是太夸张。可这一次，着实是夸张得过分了。\n\n    一个人啊，吃了三十个人的早餐！而食堂就准备了这么多。等其他学员来的时候，蓝轩宇自己也发现自己闯祸了。可是，他已经吃完了啊！他已经给牧重天打了魂导通信汇报了，实在是因为他自己也不知道该如何是好。\n\n    “好了，你们别吵了。难道还能让他吐出来?他吐出来的你们吃吗？”叶灵瞳说道。\n\n    蓝轩宇不禁有些惊讶地看了她一眼，他倒是没想到，叶灵瞳会向着自己说话。\n\n    就在这时，牧重天从外面走了进来，同时进来的还有几位端着饭菜的厨师。\n\n    “好了，大家先吃早饭。蓝轩宇的身体可能出了一些问题，轩宇，你跟我来，我带你去医务室检查一下。”\n\n    “哦，是。”\n\n    蓝轩宇赶忙跟着牧重天出去了。\n\n    他今天真的是不占理，无论怎么说，把同学们的早饭都给吃了这事儿，确实做得不对。但他当时真的是饿得眼冒金星，吃的时候完全停不下来啊！哪怕是吃了那么多东西，现在他的肚子也没有任何饱胀的感觉。\n\n    出了食堂，蓝轩宇惊讶地发现，银天凡竟然站在食堂门外。\n\n    “老师。”看到银天凡，蓝轩宇顿时觉得肠胃有些翻滚，甚至一下就完全不饿了。昨天那乘坐星际战机的体验带给他的刺激，多少给他留下了一些阴影。\n\n    银天凡道：“你的情况很正常，不用自卑。你是因为消耗太大，自身血脉又需要太多\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
