It served as a key landmark along the Royal Road, near which confrontations with the Museum Fremen occurred, and was crossed by a faery bridge as part of a journey's route. Flowing near the settlement of Onn, the river shares its name with Duncan Idaho, reflecting his enduring influence.  \n\nThe Idaho River flowed southward beyond the Sareer's boundary wall, visible under moonlight and audible through the ground, suggesting its presence was both seen and felt. For Kwuteg, it represented a sanctuary, symbolizing safety from the predatory D-wolves. Duncan Idaho himself reflected upon the river during a conversation with Moneo, noting its tamed nature within the Sareer region. Siona later crossed it to escape a wolf pack, marking the boundary of the Forbidden Forest.  \n\nThe river was also a man-made waterway, flowing through a canyon, embodying the planet's transformation under Leto II's rule. However, its fate shifted dramatically over time. Once a vital feature on Rakis, it eventually vanished, leaving only dry remnants near the Sareer. It was here that the Tyrant met his end, falling from his bridge into what was once the riverbed.  \n\nDespite contradictions in its state—described both as flowing and later dry—the Idaho River's significance remains clear. It was a place of passage, conflict, and reflection, deeply intertwined with the planet's history and the figures who shaped it. Whether as a sanctuary, a boundary, or a symbol of Leto's rule, the Idaho River played a pivotal role in the events of Rakis before its eventual disappearance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251823, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 367, "prompt_tokens": 409, "total_tokens": 776, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 345}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
