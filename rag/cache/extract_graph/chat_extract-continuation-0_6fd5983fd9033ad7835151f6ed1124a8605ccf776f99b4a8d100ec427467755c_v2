Even within the fine patina of Imperial civilization and its sophisticated rules they remained half-tamed savages, aware always that a crysknife dissolved at the death of its owner.\nThat’s what can save us, Leto thought. That wildness.\nIn the distance the spice-scout banked right, then left, a Signal to the ground. He imagined the occupants scanning the desert behind him for sign that he might be more than a single rider on a single worm.\nLeto rolled the worm to the left, held it until it had reversed its course, dropped down the flank, and leaped clear. The worm, released from his goading, sulked on the surface for a few breaths, then sank its front third and lay there recuperating, a sure sign that it had been ridden too long.\nHe turned away from the worm; it would stay there now. The scout was circling its crawler, still giving wing signals. They were smuggler-paid renegades for certain, wary of electronic communications. The hunters would be on spice out there. That was the message of the crawler’s presence.\nThe scout circled once more, dipped its wings, came out of the circle and headed directly toward him. He recognized it for a type of light ’thopter his grandfather had introduced on Arrakis. The craft circled once above him, went out along the dune where he stood, and banked to land against the breeze. It came down within ten meters of him, stirring up a scattering of dust. The door on his side cracked enough to emit a single figure in a heavy Fremen robe with a spear symbol at the right breast.\nThe Fremen approached slowly, giving each of them time to study the other. The man was tall with the total indigo of spice-eyes. The stillsuit mask concealed the lower half of his face and the hood had been drawn down to protect his brows. The movement of the robe revealed a hand beneath it holding a maula pistol.\nThe man stopped two paces from Leto, looked down at him with a puzzled crinkling around the eyes.\n“Good fortune to us all,” Leto said.\nThe man peered all around, scanning the emptiness, then returned his attention to Leto. “What do you here, child?” he demanded. His voice was muffled by the stillsuit mask. “Are you trying to be the cork in a wormhole?”\nAgain Leto used traditional Fremen formula: “The desert is my home.”\n“Wenn?” the man demanded. Which way do you go?\n“I travel south from Jacurutu.”\nAn abrupt laugh erupted from the man. “Well, Batigh! You are the strangest thing I’ve ever seen in the Tanzerouft.”\n“I’m not your Little Melon,” Leto said, responding to Batigh. That was a label with dire overtones. The Little Melon on the desert’s edge offered its water to any finder.\n“We'll not drink you, Batigh,” the man said. “I am Muriz. | am the arifa of this taif.” He indicated with a head motion the distant spice-crawler.\nLeto noted how the man called himself the Judge of his group and referred to the others as ta/f, a band or company.\nThey were not /chwan, not a band of brothers. Paid renegades for sure. Here lay the thread he required.\nWhen Leto remained silent, Muriz asked: “Do you have a name?”\n“Batigh will do.”\nA chuckle shook Muriz. “You’ve not told me what you do here?”\n“I seek the footprints of a worm,” Leto said, using the religious phrase which said he was on hajj for his own umma, his personal revelation.\n“One so young?” Muriz asked. He shook his head. “I don’t know what to do with you. You have seen us.”\n“What have | seen?” Leto asked. “I speak of Jacurutu and you make no response.”\n“Riddle games,” Muriz said. “What is that, then?” He nodded toward the distant butte.\nLeto spoke from his vision: “Only Shuloch.”\nMuriz stiffened and Leto felt his own pulse quicken.\nA long silence ensued and Leto could see the man debating and discarding various responses. Shuloch! In the quiet story time after a sietch meal, stories of the Shuloch Ccaravanserie were often repeated. Listeners always assumed that Shuloch was a myth, a place for interesting things to happen and only for the sake of the story. Leto recalled a Shuloch story: A waif was found at the desert’s edge and brought into the sietch. At first the waif refused to respond to his saviors, then when he spoke no one could understand his words. As days passed he continued unresponsive, refused to dress himself or cooperate in any way. Every time he was left alone he made odd motions with his hands. All the specialists in the sietch were called in to study this waif but arrived at no answer. Then a very old woman passed the doorway, saw the moving hands, and laughed. “He only imitates his father who rolls the spice- fibers into rope,” she explained. “It’s the way they still do it at Shuloch. He’s just trying to feel less lonely.” And the\nmoral: “In the old ways of Shuloch there is security and a sense of belonging to the golden thread of life.”\nAs Muriz remained silent, Leto said: “I’m the waif from Shuloch who knows only to move his hands.”\nIn the quick movement of the man’s head, Leto saw that Muriz knew the story. Muriz responded slowly, voice low and filled with menace. “Are you human?”\n“Human as yourself,” Leto said.\n“You speak most strangely for a child. | remind you that | am a judge who can respond to the taqwa.”\nAh, yes, Leto thought. In the mouth of such a judge, the taqwa carried immediate threat. Taqwa was the fear invoked by the presence of a demon, a very real belief among older Fremen. The arifa knew the ways to slay a demon and was always chosen “because he has the wisdom to be ruthless without being cruel, to know when kindness is in fact the way to greater cruelty.”\nBut this thing had come to the point which Leto sought, and he said: “I can submit to the Mashhad.”\n“I'll be the judge of any Spiritual Test,” Muriz said. “Do you accept this?”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” Leto said. Without qualification.\nA sly look came over Muriz’s face. He said: “I don’t know why I permit this. Best you were slain out of hand, but you're a small Batigh and I had a son who is dead. Come, we will go to Shuloch and l'Il convene the Isnad for a decision about you.”\nLeto, noting how the man’s every mannerism betrayed deadly decision, wondered how anyone could be fooled by this. He said: “I know Shuloch is the Ahl as-sunna wal- jamas.”\n“What does a child know of the real world?” Muriz asked, motioning for Leto to precede him to the ’thopter.\nLeto obeyed, but listened carefully to the sound of the Fremen’s footsteps. “The surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer,” Leto\nsaid. “People don’t ask questions then. It was clever of you who were cast out of Jacurutu. Who’d believe Shuloch, the story-myth place, is real? And how convenient for the Smugglers or anyone else who desires access to Dune.”\nMuriz’s footsteps stopped. Leto turned with his back against the ‘thopter’s side, the wing on his left.\nMuriz stood half a pace away with his maula pistol drawn and pointed directly at Leto. “So you’re not a child,” Muriz said. “A cursed midget come to spy on us! | thought you spoke too wisely for a child, but you spoke too much too soon.”\n“Not enough,” Leto said. “I’m Leto, the child of Paul Muad’Dib. If you slay me, you and your people will sink into\nthe sand. If you spare me, l'Il lead you to greatness.” “Don’t play games with me, midget,” Muriz snarled. “Leto is at the real Jacurutu from whence you say .. .” He broke\noff. The gun hand dropped slightly as a puzzled frown made his eyes squint.\nIt was the hesitation Leto had expected. He made every muscle indication of a move to the left which, deflecting his body no more than a millimeter, brought the Fremen’s gun swinging wildly against the wing edge. The maula pistol flew from his hand and, before he could recover, Leto was beside him with Muriz’s own crysknife pressed against the man’s back.\n“The tip’s poisoned,” Leto said. “Tell your friend in the ‘thopter that he’s to remain exactly where he is without moving at all. Otherwise l'Il be forced to kill you.”\nMuriz, nursing his injured hand, shook his head at the figure in the 'thopter, said: “My companion Behaleth has heard you. He will be as unmoving as the rock.”\nKnowing he had very little time until the two worked out a plan of action or their friends came to investigate, Leto spoke swiftly: “You need me, Muriz. Without me, the worms and their spice will vanish from Dune.” He felt the Fremen stiffen.\n“But how do you know of Shuloch?” Muriz asked. “I know they said nothing at Jacurutu.”\n“So you admit I’m Leto Atreides?”\n“Who else could you be? But how do you—”\n“Because you are here,” Leto said. “Shuloch exists, therefore the rest is utter simplicity. You are the Cast Out who escaped when Jacurutu was destroyed. | saw you signal with your wings, therefore you use no device which could be overheard at a distance. You collect spice, therefore you trade. You could only trade with the smugglers. You are a Smuggler, yet you are Fremen. You must be of Shuloch.”\n“Why did you tempt me to slay you out of hand?”\n“Because you would’ve slain me anyway when we’d returned to Shuloch.”\nA violent rigidity came over Muriz’s body.\n“Careful, Muriz,” Leto cautioned. “I know about you. It was in your history that you took the water of unwary travelers. By now this would be common ritual with you. How else could you silence the ones who chanced upon you? How else keep your secret? Batigh! You’d seduce me with gentle epithets and kindly words. Why waste any of my water upon the sand? And if | were missed as were many of the others—well, the Tanzerouft got me.”\nMuriz made the Horns-of-the-Worm sign with his right hand to ward off the Rihani which Leto’s words called up. And Leto, knowing how older Fremen distrusted mentats or anything which smacked of them by a show of extended logic, Suppressed a smile.\n“Manri spoke of us at Jacurutu,” Muriz said. “I will have his water when—”\n“You'll have nothing but empty sand if you continue playing the fool,” Leto\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the child of Paul Muad'Dib, a young and intelligent figure who demonstrates deep knowledge of Fremen customs and survival skills in the desert.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURIZ<|>PERSON<|>Muriz is a Fremen arifa (judge) and leader of a renegade group involved in spice smuggling.
