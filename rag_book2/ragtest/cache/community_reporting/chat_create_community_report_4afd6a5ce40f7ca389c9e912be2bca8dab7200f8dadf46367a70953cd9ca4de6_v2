She is known for her reserved personality, keeping a diary, and her admiration for her close friend **唐泽雪穗 (Karazawa Yukiho)**, whom she met in junior high and remained friends with through university.  \n\nCautious and observant, 川岛江利子 became aware of the assault incident involving **藤村都子 (Fujimura Miyoko)** and kept it a secret, as advised by 唐泽雪穗. She also attended English conversation classes with 雪穗, where they discovered the truth about the incident.  \n\nDespite her shyness, 江利子 developed a passion for ballroom dancing and was specially recruited by **筱冢一成 (Shinozuka Kazunari)** as a VIP member of the university's social dance club. Though she harbored romantic feelings for 筱冢, she believed their social statuses were too different. Initially hesitant about dancing due to her reserved nature, she eventually underwent a transformation—changing her hairstyle (as suggested by 雪穗) and improving her image at a beauty salon. However, she abruptly withdrew from the dance club for unknown reasons, leaving **高宫诚 (Takamiya Makoto)**, who had feelings for her, without pursuing her.  \n\nLater in life, 川岛江利子 married, though she privately believed that **高宫诚** was not the man 唐泽雪穗 truly loved. Her friendship with 雪穗 remained strong, even as she maintained a quiet, unassuming demeanor.  \n\nIn summary, 川岛江利子 is a diligent, introverted woman whose life was marked by her deep friendship with 唐泽雪穗, her brief but impactful involvement in social dance, and her unspoken romantic longings.
