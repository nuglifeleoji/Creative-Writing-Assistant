\n　　徐治功哪有心思喝茶抽烟啊！事到如今，他也顾不了多少，就厚着脸向明川直截了当说明了他的来意。白明川张着惊讶的嘴巴听他说完后，从沙发里站起来，立在地上急得摊开两只手，说：“啊呀，治功！你怎挤这么些没名堂的事！你几十岁的人了，又是个领导干部，怎能这么不检点呢？你呀……” \n　　白明川真不知怎样数落他的前副手。 \n　　徐治功垂头丧气地说：“乱子已经闯下了。教训我以后会记取的。只是眼前这一关就过不去。我知道你和咱们县委书记张有智关系好，你现在这位置说话他也重视，因此我求你给他写一封信……” \n　　白明川想了一下，诚恳地说：“不是我不愿帮助你，这种事我实在不好帮。要说和张有智的个人关系，我倒想起一个人，但不知他会不会帮你……” \n　　“谁？”徐治功急着问。 \n　　“徐国强。你不是和他一个家族的吗？徐老过去也是张有智的老上级……你是不是去找找他？” \n　　“我怕碰上田书记……” \n　　“田书记一般不在家。他家里有电话，你现在可以先打电话和徐老约一下……” \n　　徐治功只好拿起明川桌子上的电话。 \n　　打完电话后，徐治功对白明川说：“徐老让我现在就过来。” \n　　“那你快去吧！”明川说。“毕了你过来在我这里住。”徐治功出门的时候，又对白明川说：“如果徐老不肯带忙，还得要你出面哩！” \n　　白明川说：“你先去。罢了再说。” \n　　徐治功淌过小南河，几乎是小跑着来到南关的地委家属楼上。 \n　　使他高兴的是，这一趟没白跑。 \n　　同族长辈徐国强怀里抱着一只小黑猫，听他说完后，先指着鼻子把他臭骂一通；然后戴起老花镜，用核桃大的字给他以前的下级张有智写了一封求情信。 \n　　徐治功感激涕零地拿起这“圣旨”，一再央求本族叔叔不敢把这事说给田福军；随后就一溜烟又从地委大院里跑出来了。 \n　　本来他想去白明川那里住一晚上，但现在才感到不好意思去见明川了。于是他就在街上一个小旅社里随便登记了个房间，浑身酸疼地睡了一夜……第二天一大早，他就跑到东关买了张汽车票，直奔原西县城。 \n　　上午十点钟左右，徐治功从原西车站跑出来，低着头向县委走去。 \n　　路过供销经理部的时候，他瞥了一眼楼上那个熟悉的窗口，困难地咽了一口吐沫——他老婆就在那窗户后面办公。徐治功在往县委走的路上，又遇到好多人和他打招呼。他支吾着应付一下，慌忙地只顾朝前走。他感觉人们都用一种异样的眼光看他。唉，说不定事情已经在城里传成一窝\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
