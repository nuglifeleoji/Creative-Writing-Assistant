   是时十二月终，果然天降大雪。姜维引军出，越吉引铁车兵来。姜维即退走。羌兵赶到寨前，姜维从寨后而去。羌兵直到寨外观看，听得寨内鼓琴之声，四壁皆空竖旌旗，急回报越吉。越吉心疑，未敢轻进。雅丹丞相曰：“此诸葛亮诡计，虚设疑兵耳。可以攻之。”越吉引兵至寨前，但见孔明携琴上车，引数骑入寨，望后而走。羌兵抢入寨栅，直赶过山口，见小车隐隐转入林中去了。雅丹谓越吉曰：“这等兵虽有埋伏，不足为惧。”遂引大兵追赶。又见姜维兵俱在雪地之中奔走。越吉大怒，催兵急追。山路被雪漫盖，一望平坦。正赶之间，忽报蜀兵自山后而出。雅丹曰：“纵有些小伏兵，何足惧哉！”只顾催趱兵马，往前进发。忽然一声响，如山崩地陷，羌兵俱落于坑堑之中；背后铁车正行得紧溜，急难收止，并拥而来，自相践踏。后兵急要回时，左边关兴、右边张苞，两军冲出，万弩齐发；背后姜维、马岱、张冀三路兵又杀到。铁车兵大乱。越吉元帅望后面山谷中而逃，正逢关兴；交马只一合，被兴举刀大喝一声，砍死于马下。雅丹丞相早被马岱活捉，解投大寨来。羌兵四散逃窜。孔明升帐，马岱押过雅丹来。孔明叱武士去其缚，赐酒压惊，用好言抚慰。雅丹深感其德。孔明曰：“吾主乃大汉皇帝，今命吾讨贼，尔如何反助逆？吾今放汝回去，说与汝主：吾国与尔乃邻邦，永结盟好，勿听反贼之言。”遂将所获羌兵及车马器械，尽给还雅丹，俱放回国。众皆拜谢而去。孔明引三军连夜投祁山大寨而来，命关兴、张苞引军先行；一面差人赍表奏报�\n######################\nOutput:",
