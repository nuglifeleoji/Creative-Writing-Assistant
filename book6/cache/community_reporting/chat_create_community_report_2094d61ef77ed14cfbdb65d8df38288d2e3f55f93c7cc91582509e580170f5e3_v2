This concept is prominently discussed in the context of the conversations between 叶文洁 and 罗辑, where it serves as a framework for understanding the complexities of extraterrestrial societies. Proposed by 叶文洁, 宇宙社会学 combines elements of sociology and mathematics, allowing for a systematic examination of how civilizations might develop and interact across the cosmos.\n\nThe field is characterized by its hypothetical nature, focusing on the various forms that civilizations could take and the societal patterns that may emerge in different environments. 宇宙社会学 aims to uncover the underlying structures and rules governing these civilizations, providing insights into their social dynamics and potential behaviors. As 罗辑 engages with this discipline, he seeks to deepen his understanding of the social frameworks that could exist beyond Earth, contributing to the broader discourse on the nature of life and society in the universe.\n\nIn summary, 宇宙社会学 is an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that merges sociology and mathematics to investigate the social structures of possible extraterrestrial civilizations, as discussed by 叶文洁 and explored by 罗辑.\",3\r\n8,杨冬,\"杨冬 is a significant character in the narrative, known for her connections to both 罗辑 and her mother, 叶文洁. She is portrayed as a multifaceted individual who plays various roles throughout the story. \n\nFirstly, 杨冬 is identified as the daughter of 叶文洁, a pivotal figure in the plot. This familial relationship adds depth to her character, linking her to the broader themes of legacy and the impact of parental influence on one's life choices and actions. \n\nIn addition to her familial ties, 杨冬 is also depicted as a companion of 罗辑, actively participating in matters related to the 三体 world. This involvement suggests that she is not merely a passive character but rather an integral part of the efforts to navigate the complexities introduced by the 三体 civilization. Her role alongside 罗辑 indicates a shared commitment to addressing the challenges posed by this alien world, highlighting her as a proactive and engaged individual within the narrative.\n\nMoreover, 杨冬's connection to 罗辑 extends back to their high school days, where she is remembered as a classmate who frequently mentions him. This aspect of their relationship adds a layer of nostalgia and personal history, suggesting that their bond is rooted in a long-standing friendship that has evolved over time. Her recollections of 罗辑 may also serve to illustrate the impact he has had on her life, reinforcing the theme of interconnectedness among characters in the story.\n\nIn summary, 杨冬 is a complex character whose identity is shaped by her relationships with both her mother, 叶文洁, and 罗辑. As a daughter, a companion, and a high school classmate, she embodies the intertwining of personal and broader existential themes within the narrative, contributing significantly to the unfolding events related to the 三体 world.\",3\r\n11,叶文洁,\"叶文洁是一个重要的角色，她在叙事中探讨了宇宙社会学的概念及其理论意义，显示出对这一主题的深刻理解。作为一名思想者，叶文洁提到遥远的星空和外星文明的复杂性，提出了宇宙文明公理，这一理论对罗辑的思考产生了深远的影响。\n\n在故事中，叶文洁的墓碑被罗辑所寻找，表明她在叙事中的重要性和她与罗辑之间的深厚情感联系。叶文洁不仅是罗辑的前同事，还是他的伴侣，他们曾共同面对星空，参与与三体世界的交流。她的角色不仅限于学术讨论，还涉及到个人情感和人际关系，进一步丰富了她在故事中的形象。\n\n叶文洁的影响力体现在她对罗辑的建议上，她曾鼓励罗辑研究宇宙社会学，这一建议在故事的发展中起到了关键作用。她的存在和思想为罗辑的探索提供了重要的理论基础，使他在面对宇宙的复杂性时，能够更深入地思考人类与外星文明之间的关系。\n\n总的来说，叶文洁是一个多层次的角色，她的思想、情感和与其他角色的关系共同构成了她在叙事中的重要性。通过她的视角，读者得以窥见宇宙社会学的深邃和外星文明的复杂性，同时也感受到人类情感在面对浩瀚宇宙时的脆弱与坚韧。\",6\r\n959,红岸遗址,\"红岸遗址 is a location that 罗辑 recalls, associated with memories of forgetting.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n7,罗辑,宇宙社会学,罗辑对宇宙社会学这一领域表现出浓厚的兴趣，并在叶文洁的鼓励下决定深入探索这一学科。他正在思考宇宙社会学的基本公理和概念，努力理解这一研究领域的核心内容。罗辑不仅提到宇宙社会学作为一个独立的研究领域，还积极进行相关的研究，成为他当前思考的主题。通过这些努力，罗辑希望能够更好地掌握宇宙社会学的理论框架和应用，推动自己在这一领域的学术发展。,270\r\n1617,杨冬,三体世界,杨冬参与了与三体世界的事务，支持罗辑的谈判。,23\r\n8,叶文洁,宇宙社会学,\"叶文洁 is a prominent figure in the field of 宇宙社会学, contributing significantly to the discourse surrounding this emerging discipline.
