\n　　夜晚的黄原城闪烁着繁星般灿烂的灯火。城市仍然没有安静下来，不过嘈杂声似乎变得遥远而模糊。远远近近的灯光投照在碧波粼粼的河水里，一片明光闪闪。风并不温暖，但很柔和地吹过来，象羽毛在人脸颊上轻拂。 \n　　他们沿着河边，慢慢向上游新桥那里走。少平自到黄原后，第一次这么悠闲地出来散步，心情倒有说不出的美妙。此刻，忧愁和挣扎都退远了，一切都变得如此平静，就象一个刚从火线上下来的士兵，重新回到了和平的环境中。 \n　　金波虽然个子比少平低，但尽量用一条胳膊搂着少平的肩膀。两个人手臂相攀在夜晚的河边上款款而行，看起来倒象一对亲密的情侣。 \n　　起先他们都默默无语地这样行走着。后来，两个人坐在了河边的一块大石头上。朗朗的黄原河水就在他们脚下流淌。河对岸是一片密集的灯火；灯火后面是黑黝黝的麻雀山。弯弯的月牙儿象一柄银镰，悬挂在乌蓝的天空。 \n　　金波凝视着满河流泻的波光灯影，轻轻叹息了一声。 \n　　“你好象有什么心事？”少平扭过脸看着他的朋友。“是啊。我很想给你说一说。这是几年前的事了……”金波仍然望着河水，嘴里喃喃地说。 \n　　少平静默无言。他似乎感觉到金波要给他说的是什么。他不再询问了。 \n　　金波沉默了一会，便开始给朋友讲述起了他自己的故事。少平一声不吭，静静地听着。 \n　　“……我刚复员的时候，你大概听见过传闻，说我和一个藏族女子谈恋爱，叫部队打发回来了。那是真的。你奇怪吗？不奇怪？是啊，有些事看起来奇怪，可是实际上又没有什么奇怪的…… \n　　“那年当兵我离开家乡，第一次走了那么远。又坐汽车，又坐火车，真不知道要被拉到什么地方。一直向西，穿过河西走廊，穿过无数的山脉和河流，最后来到了青海。“我们的部队分散在一片草原上。你知道，我是文艺兵，在师部文工团吹笛子。文工团就和师部住在一起。我们的驻地周围几乎没什么居民点，几十间简易房子孤零零地立在一望无际的大草原上。旁边有一个小小的湖泊，湖边上围着一圈白花花的盐碱。远方的地平线上，是一列绵延不断的山峦。峰巅之上终年戴着雪冠。 \n　　“不过，我们的驻地旁边有一个军马场，这使环境稍微有一些生机。日出的时候，出牧的马群象一团团彩云向\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>黄原河<|>GEO<|>黄原河 is a river that flows through
