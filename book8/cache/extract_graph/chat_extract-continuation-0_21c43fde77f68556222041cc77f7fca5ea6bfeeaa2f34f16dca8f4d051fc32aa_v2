�路，还有那些水珠，都可能是变异产生的。而围绕在草叶周围的这圈白色光环就是我们所说的魂环，也是对我们魂师来说至关重要的存在。”\n\n    “虽然白色魂环只是十年的，但联邦早已有了提升魂环等级的一些办法。当然，也比较昂贵。只要未来蓝轩宇同学能够修炼到更强的层次，也还是有机会继续提升他魂环的。好了，蓝轩宇，收起你的武魂吧。”\n\n    “嗯呢。”蓝轩宇收回自己的蓝银草，重新坐了下来。\n\n    “魂环就代表着魂师之间的差距。”秋雨馨继续上课，“除了最初的魂士、魂师之外，接下来再提升十级，就能够成为大魂师。然后是魂尊、魂宗、魂王、魂帝、魂圣、魂斗罗、封号斗罗。九十级到一百级被称为封号斗罗。其中还有一些小的划分，譬如，九十五级以上被称为超级斗罗，而九十九级则是极限斗罗。”\n\n    “为什么这么划分呢？因为，在万年前，九十九级就是我们魂师的极限了。直到那场划时代的位面之战，联邦在当时的一代大能，龙皇斗罗唐舞麟的带领下战胜想要阴谋吞噬我们的深渊位面，并将深渊位面融入到母星之中后，从而使得母星的生命古树进化成为永恒之树，让整个母星随之进化。那一场史诗战役可以说一直影响到现在。因为，如果没有那一战的成果，联邦甚至连星际移民的资源都不可能凑齐。”\n\n    “吞噬了深渊位面之后，母星开始晋升，以至于整个母星上的能量层次都随之晋升，也让我们的魂师，有了更进一步的可能。也才有了之后百级以上的神阶。有关于神阶以上的层次，你们以后要到高级魂师学院之后才会学到，老师今天就不在这里赘述了。你们今天需要记住的，就是老师前面说的这十个阶段的称号。”\n\n    蓝轩宇是个乖巧，而且精神力很容易集中的孩子，他听的很认真。哪怕有些知识爸爸也讲过，但他还是认真的听着。\n\n    通过昨天和同学们的认识，他已经知道，他是一年级二班唯一一个超过十级的学员，也就是班里魂力等级最强的一个。否则今天秋雨馨也不会让他来做示范。\n\n    上午是理论学习，下午是实战课。而对于一年级的学生来说，所谓的实战课其实就是锻炼身体。\n\n    一年级二班的实战课是和一年级一班合在一起的大课。\n\n    所以，蓝轩宇在下午的实战课上，又一次见到了叶灵瞳。\n------------\n\n第十八章 叶灵瞳之殇\n\n    叶灵瞳自然也看到了他，当初的敌视虽然已经少了许多。但小女孩儿的记忆却是很好的，也有点记仇，尤其她还清楚的记得当\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
