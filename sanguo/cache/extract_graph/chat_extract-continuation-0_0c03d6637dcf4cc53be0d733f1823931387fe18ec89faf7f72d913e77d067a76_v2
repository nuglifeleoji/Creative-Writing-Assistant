秘书丞张华围棋消遣。近臣奏边庭有表到。晋主开视之，乃杜预表也。表略云：“往者，羊祜不博谋于朝臣，而密与陛下计，故令朝臣多异同之议。凡事当以利害相校，度此举之利，十有八九，而其害止于无功耳。自秋以来，讨贼之形颇露；今若中止，孙皓恐怖，徙都武昌，完修江南诸城，迁其居民，城不可攻，野无所掠，则明年之计亦无及矣。”晋主览表才罢，张华突然而起，推却棋枰，敛手奏曰：“陛下圣武，国富民强；吴主淫虐，民忧国敝。今若讨之，可不劳而定。愿勿以为疑。”晋主曰：“卿言洞见利害，朕复何疑。”即出升殿，命镇南大将军杜预为大都督，引兵十万出江陵；镇东大将军琅琊王司马伷出涂中；安东大将军王浑出横江；建威将军王戎出武昌；平南将军胡奋出夏口：各引兵五万，皆听预调用。又遣龙骧将军王濬、广武将军唐彬，浮江东下：水陆兵二十余万，战船数万艘。又令冠军将军杨济出屯襄阳，节制诸路人马。\n\n

早有消息报入东吴。吴主皓大慌，急召丞相张悌、司徒何植、司空膝循，计议退兵之策。悌奏曰：“可令车骑将军伍延为都督，进兵江陵，迎敌杜预；骠骑将军孙歆进兵拒夏口等处军马。臣敢为军师，领左将军沈莹、右将军诸葛靓，引兵十万，出兵牛渚，接应诸路军马。”皓从之，遂令张悌引兵去了。皓退入后宫，不安忧色。幸臣中常侍岑昏问其故。皓曰：“晋兵大至，诸路已有兵迎之；争奈王濬率兵数万，战船齐备，顺流而下，其锋甚锐：朕因此忧也。”昏曰：“臣有一计，令王濬之舟，皆为齑粉矣。”皓大喜，遂问其计。岑昏奏曰：“江南多铁，可打连环索百余条，长数百丈，每环重二三十斤，于沿江紧要去处横截之。再造铁锥数万，长丈余，置于水中。若晋船乘风而来，逢锥则破，岂能渡江也？”皓大喜，传令拨匠工于江边连夜造成铁索、铁锥，设立停当。\n\n
