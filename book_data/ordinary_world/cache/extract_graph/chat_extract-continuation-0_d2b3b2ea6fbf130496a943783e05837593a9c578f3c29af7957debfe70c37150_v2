水面离坝梁很高，他们不可能把罐子村的水放出来。情况正如金俊武精明地估计到的：只能把石圪节的水放出来，盈满罐子村的水坝，才能从罐子村的豁口里再往双水村流。金俊武一边挖豁口，一边还对另外两个人说：“咱们等于给罐子村也做了好事。今晚上他们坝里的水也就盛满了。要不，他们现在这点水也浇不了几天地就完了！” \n　　金俊武的确是个周到人。他甚至指导另外两个人不损坏罐子村的水坝。他们只是在坝与河岸的衔接处挖开一个不大的豁口——俊武估计这豁口流半夜水已足够盛满双水村的坝了。 \n　　金俊武他们虽然路近，可孙玉亭是“机械化部队”，尽管他们出发晚，但比金俊武他们先一步回到了双水村。 \n　　等金俊武三个人进了大队部的院子时，看见队里的拖拉机已经停在了院子里。公窑里还是只是田福堂一个人。其余的人田福堂已让孙玉亭带着，又赶到村前支援金俊山他们加高坝梁去了。 \n　　田福堂象迎接打了胜仗的勇士一般，迎接了金俊武三个人。他给三个人一人递上一支“大前门”纸烟。福堂在这中间回了一次家，专门把自家的纸烟拿了几盒，以嘉奖这些外出作战的“部队”。 \n　　他问金俊武：“都好了？” \n　　金俊武点着纸烟，说：“都好了。” \n　　“那好！叫他两个先到前面坝梁上去，咱两个先等一等。我已经叫金成和田海民两个到后村头照水去了。等水一出来，咱再到前面坝上去。” \n　　那两个人抽着书记给他们的纸烟，就打着工具先走了。田福堂和金俊武两个人先后进了大队部的窑洞。他们在这里等待金成和田海民报告水来的消息。田福堂很愿意和金俊武单独呆一会。金俊武和孙少安是村里他最头疼的两个人。原来他对金俊武气更大一些。但自从他发现城里教书的女儿和少安有点“麻糊”以来，他就对少安比对金俊武更恼火了。他现在很愿意和金家湾的这位“领袖”把关系弄好一些。当然，他知道他永远不会把金俊武弄得象孙玉亭那样对他言听计从，百依百顺；他只是想让这个强人不要处处拐着弯和他过不去就满意了。 \n　　进了公窑后，田福堂又给金俊武递上一根纸烟。他也没什么正经八板的话，就随便拉家常说：“唉，你父亲可是个好人哩！我们小时候，金先生冬闲了就在村里办冬学，教穷人家娃娃识字。我也跟你爸学过字，可头一天学了，第二天就忘得一干二净。天生的不是个念书人嘛……” \n　　田福堂说着，就仰起头笑了\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
