   天色微明，黑云罩地，东南风尚不息。忽然大雨倾盆，湿透衣甲。操与军士冒雨而行，诸军皆有饥色。操令军士往村落中劫掠粮食，寻觅火种。方欲造饭，后面一军赶到。操心甚慌。原来却是李典、许褚保护着众谋士来到，操大喜，令军马且行，问：“前面是那里地面？”人报：“一边是南彝陵大路，一边是北彝陵山路。”操问：“那里投南郡江陵去近？”军士禀曰：“取南彝陵过葫芦口去最便。”操教走南彝陵。行至葫芦口，军皆饥馁，行走不上，马亦困乏，多有倒于路者。操教前面暂歇。马上有带得锣锅的，也有村中掠得粮米的，便就山边拣干处埋锅造饭，割马肉烧吃。尽皆脱去湿衣，于风头吹晒；马皆摘鞍野放，咽咬草根。\n######################\nOutput:",
