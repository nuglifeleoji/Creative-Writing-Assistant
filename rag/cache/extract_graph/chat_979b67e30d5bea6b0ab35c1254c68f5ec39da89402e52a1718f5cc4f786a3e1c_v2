Stilgar summoned me. He sent Modibo, the Bent One, his messenger in sietch. Modibo gave me no warning. He merely told me Stilgar wanted me.”\n“And you saw my husband’s body there on the floor?”\nHe met her eyes with a darting glance, returned his attention once more to the floor in front of her before nodding. “Yes, My Lady. And Javid dead nearby. Stilgar told me .. . told me that the Holy Consort had slain Javid.”\n“And my husband, you say Stilgar—”\n“He said it to me with his own mouth, My Lady. Stilgar said he had done this. He said the Holy Consort provoked him to rage.”\n“Rage,” Alia repeated. “How was that done?”\n“He didn’t say. No one said. | asked and no one said.”\n“And that’s when you were sent to me with this news?”\n“Yes, My Lady.”\n“Was there nothing you could do?”\nAgarves wet his lips with his tongue, then: “Stilgar commanded, My Lady. It was his sietch.”\n“I see. And you always obeyed Stilgar.”\n“I always did, My Lady, until he freed me from my bond.”\n“When you were sent to my service, you mean?”\n“| obey only you now, My Lady.”\n“Is that right? Tell me, Buer, if | commanded you to slay Stilgar, your old Naib, would you do it?”\nHe met her gaze with a growing firmness. “If you commanded it, My Lady.”\n“I do command it. Have you any idea where he’s gone?”\n“Into the desert; that’s all | know, My Lady.”\n“How many men did he take?”\n“Perhaps half the effectives.”\n“And Ghanima and Irulan with him!”\n“Yes, My Lady. Those who left are burdened with their women, their children and their baggage. Stilgar gave everyone a choice—go with him or be freed of their bond. Many chose to be freed. They will select a new Naib.”\n“I'll select their new Naib! And it'll be you, Buer Agarves, on the day you bring me Stilgar’s head.”\nAgarves could accept selection by battle. It was a Fremen\nway. He said: “As you command, My Lady. What forces may |\n“See Zia. | can’t give you many ‘thopters for the search. They’re needed elsewhere. But you'll have enough fighting men. Stilgar has defamed his honor. Many will serve with you gladly.”\n“I'll get about it, then, My Lady.”\n“Wait!” She studied him a moment, reviewing whom she could send to watch over this vulnerable infant. He would need close watching until he’d proved himself. Zia would know whom to send.\n“Am | not dismissed, My Lady?”\n“You are not dismissed. | must consult you privately and at length on your plans to take Stilgar.” She put a hand to her face. “l'Il not grieve until you’ve exacted my revenge. Give me a few minutes to compose myself.” She lowered her hand. “One of my attendants will show you the way.” She gave a subtle hand signal to one of her attendants, whispered to Shalus, her new Dame of Chamber: “Have him washed and perfumed before you bring him. He smells of worm.”\n“Yes, mistress.”\nAlia turned then, feigning the grief she did not feel, and fled to her private chambers. There, in her bedroom, she slammed the door into its tracks, cursed and stamped her foot.\nDamn that Duncan! Why? Why? Why?\nShe sensed a deliberate provocation from Idaho. He’d Slain Javid and provoked Stilgar. It said he knew about Javid. The whole thing must be taken as a message from Duncan Idaho, a final gesture.\nAgain she stamped her foot and again, raging across the bedchamber.\nDamn him! Damn him! Damn him!\nStilgar gone over to the rebels and Ghanima with him. lrulan, too.\nDamn them all!\nHer stamping foot encountered a painful obstacle, descending onto metal. Pain brought a cry from her and she peered down, finding that she’d bruised her foot on a metal buckle. She snatched it up, stood frozen at the sight of it in her hand. It was an old buckle, one of the silver-and- platinum originals from Caladan awarded originally by the Duke Leto Atreides | to his swordmaster, Duncan Idaho. She’d seen Duncan wear it many times. And he’d discarded it here.\nAlia’s fingers clutched convulsively on the buckle. Idaho had left it here when... when...\nTears sprang from her eyes, forced out against the great Fremen conditioning. Her mouth drew down into a frozen grimace and she sensed the old battle begin within her Skull, reaching out to her fingertips, to her toes. She felt that she had become two people. One looked upon these fleshly contortions with astonishment. The other sought submission to an enormous pain spreading in her chest. The tears flowed freely from her eyes now, and the Astonished One within her demanded querulously: “Who cries? Who is it that cries? Who is crying now?”\nBut nothing stopped the tears, and she felt the painfulness which flamed through her breast as it moved her flesh and hurled her onto the bed.\nStill something demanded out of that profound astonishment: “Who cries? Who is that...”\nBy these acts Leto II removed himself from the evolutionary succession. He did it with a deliberate cutting action, saying: “To be independent is to be removed.” Both twins saw beyond the needs of memory as a measuring process, that is, a way of determining their distance from their human origins. But it was left to Leto II to do the audacious thing, recognizing that a real creation is independent of its creator. He refused to reenact the evolutionary sequence, saying, “That, too, takes me farther and farther from humanity.” He saw the implications in this: that there can be no truly closed systems in life.\n—THE HOLY METAMORPHOSIS BY HARQ AL-ADA\nhere were birds thriving on the insect life which teemed\nin the damp sand beyond the broken ganat: parrots, magpies, jays. This had been a djedida, the last of the new towns, built on a foundation of exposed basalt. It was abandoned now. Ghanima, using the morning hours to study the area beyond the original plantings of the abandoned sietch, detected movement and saw a banded gecko lizard. There’d been a gila woodpecker earlier, nesting in a mud wall of the djedida.\nShe thought of it as a sietch, but it was really a collection of low walls made of stabilized mud brick surrounded by plantings to hold back the dunes. It lay within the Tanzerouft, six hundred kilometers south of Sihaya Ridge. Without human hands to maintain it, the sietch already was beginning to melt back into the desert, its walls eroded by sandblast winds, its plants dying, its plantation area cracked by the burning sun.\nYet the sand beyond the shattered qanat remained damp, attesting to the fact that the squat bulk of the windtrap still functioned.\nIn the months since their flight from Tabr the fugitives had sampled the protection of several such places made uninhabitable by the Desert Demon. Ghanima didn’t believe in the Desert Demon, although there was no denying the visible evidence of the qanat’s destruction.\nOccasionally they had word from the northern settlements through encounters with rebel spice-hunters. A few ‘thopters—some said no more than six—carried out search flights seeking Stilgar, but Arrakis was large and its desert was friendly to the fugitives. Reportedly there was a search-and-destroy force charged with finding Stilgar’s band, but the force which was led by the former Tabrite Buer Agarves had other duties and often returned to Arrakeen.\nThe rebels said there was little fighting between their men and the troops of Alia. Random depredations of the Desert Demon made Home Guard duty the first concern of Alia and the Naibs. Even the smugglers had been hit, but they were said to be scouring the desert for Stilgar, wanting the price on his head.\nStilgar had brought his band into the djedida just before dark the previous day, following the unerring moisture sense of his old Fremen nose. He’d promised they would head south for the palmyries soon, but refused to put a date on the move. Although he carried a price on his head which once would have bought a planet, Stilgar seemed the happiest and most carefree of men.\n“This is a good place for us,” he’d said, pointing out that the windtrap still functioned. “Our friends have left us some water.”\nThey were a small band now, sixty people in all. The old, the sick, and the very young had been filtered south into the palmyries, absorbed there by trusted families. Only the toughest remained, and they had many friends to the north and the south.\nGhanima wondered why Stilgar refused to discuss what was happening to the planet. Couldn’t he see it? As qanats\nwere shattered, Fremen pulled back to the northern and southern lines which once had marked the extent of their holdings. This movement could only signal what must be happening to the Empire. One condition was the mirror of the other.\nGhanima ran a hand under the collar of her stillsuit and resealed it. Despite her worries she felt remarkably free here. The inner lives no longer plagued her, although she sometimes felt their memories inserted into her consciousness. She knew from those memories what this desert had been once, before the work of the ecological transformation. It had been drier, for one thing. That unrepaired windtrap still functioned because it processed moist air.\nMany creatures which once had shunned this desert ventured to live here now. Many in the band remarked how the daylight owls proliferated. Even now, Ghanima could see antbirds. They jigged and danced along the insect lines which swarmed in the damp sand at the end of the shattered qanat. Few badgers were to be seen out here, but there were kangaroo mice in uncounted numbers.\nSuperstitious fear ruled the new Fremen, and Stilgar was no better than the rest. This djedida had been given back to the desert after its qanat had been shattered a fifth time in eleven months. Four times they’d repaired the ravages of the Desert Demon, then they’d no longer had the surplus water to risk another loss.\nIt was the same all through the djedidas and in many of the old sietches. Eight out of nine new settlements had been abandoned. Many of the old sietch communities were more crowded than they had ever been before. And while the desert entered this new phase, Fremen reverted to their old ways. They saw omens in everything. Were worms increasingly scarce except in the Tanzerouft? It was the judgment of Shai-Hulud! And dead worms had been seen with nothing to say why they died. They went back to desert\ndust swiftly after death, but those crumbling hulks which Fremen chanced upon filled the observers with terror.\nStilgar’s band had encountered such a hulk the previous month and it had taken four days for them to shake off the feeling of evil. The thing had reeked of sour and poisonous putrefaction. Its moldering hulk had been found sitting on top\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_979b67e30d5bea6b0ab35c1254c68f5ec39da89402e52a1718f5cc4f786a3e1c_v2"}
