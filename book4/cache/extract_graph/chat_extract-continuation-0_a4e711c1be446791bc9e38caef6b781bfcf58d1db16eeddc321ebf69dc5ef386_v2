书多，许多人很爱听他讲书中的故事。这一点使孙少平非常高兴，觉得自己并不是什么都低人一等。加上气候变暖，校园里已经桃红柳绿，他的心情开朗了许多。而且他的单衣薄裳现在穿起来倒也正合适，不冷不热。除过肚子照样填不饱外，其它方面应该说相当令人满意了。 \n　　这天下午劳动，全班学生在学校后面的一条拐沟里挖他们班种的地。不到一个小时，孙少平就感到饿得头晕眼花。他有气无力地抡着镰头，尽量使自己不落在别人的后面。 \n　　好不容易熬到快要收工的时候，他们村的润生突然来到他眼前，说：“少平，我姐中午来找我，说让我把你带上，下午到我二爸家去一下。她说有个事要给你说。我姐还说让你下午别在学校灶上吃，到我二爸家去吃饭……。”润生说完这话，就又回到他挖地的地方去了。 \n　　孙少平一下子被这意外的邀请弄得不知所措。 \n　　润生的姐姐叫他有什么事呢？而且还叫他到她二爸家去！ \n　　这使他感到惶恐不安——润生他二爸是县革委会的副主任，在县上可是一个大人物。有时他二爸路过回村子，坐的都是吉普车呢。记得当时他常常想走近去看看停在公路边的小车，都吓得不敢去，何况现在要叫他去他们家吃饭呢！ \n　　不过，他对润生的姐姐润叶倒怀有一种亲切的感情。尽管润叶她爸是他们村的支部书记，她二爸又是县上的领导，门第当然要高得多，但润叶姐不管对村里的什么人都特别好。而最主要的是，润叶姐小时候和他大哥一块耍大，又一起念书念到小学。后来润叶姐到县城上了中学，而哥哥因为家穷回村当了农民。但润叶姐对哥哥还象以前一样好。后来润叶姐在县上的城关小学教了书，成了公家人，每次回村来，还总要到他们家来串门，和哥哥拉家常话。她每次来他们家都不空手，总要给他祖母带一些城里买的吃食。最叫全村人惊讶的是，她每次回村来，还提着点心来看望她户族里一个傻瓜叔叔田二。田二自己傻不说，还有个傻儿子，父子俩经常在窑里屙尿，臭气熏天，村里人一般谁也不去他家踏个脚踪；而润叶姐却常提着点心去看他们，这不得不叫全村人夸赞她的德行了。 \n　　相比之下，润叶她爸倒没有她在村里威信高。由于父亲和哥哥性子都很耿直，少不了常和书记顶顶碰碰，因此他们两家的关系并不怎么好。但润叶姐却始终和他们家保持着一种亲密关系。也许因为这一点，平时书记才没有过分地和他们一家人过不去。少平在内心一直对润\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
