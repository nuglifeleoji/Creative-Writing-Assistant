只有具体数值宣布，没有相对应的成绩，所以叶灵瞳也不清楚自己这精神力算高还是算低。\n\n    精神力测试是按照魂力测试成绩顺序来进行排列的，由高到低，魂力修为最低的蓝轩宇自然就排在了最后一个。\n\n    “精神力，四十八。不错。”当有一名学员被测试出四十八的精神力时，牧重天总算是露出一丝微笑，满意的点了点头。\n\n    八岁就有四十八点的精神力，突破灵通境指日可待。精神力层面上，十岁以前能突破灵通境的，都是天才。\n\n    不过，四十八点精神力也是前面九名学员最高的一个了。\n\n    “蓝轩宇。”\n\n    蓝轩宇依言走到前面，精神力测试他还是很有信心的，因为娜娜老师曾经说过，他的精神力成长先天就会远超常人，不需要专门的修炼方法，只要练习元素掌控就自然而然的会逐步调动出来。不过，他也有日子没测试过精神力了，也不清楚自己的精神力现在达到了什么程度。\n\n    戴上精神测试仪，蓝轩宇同样感受到了那暖融融的感觉，但和叶灵瞳不同的是，在这份暖意之中，他还感受到了一些其他东西。似乎有无数丝丝缕缕的能量波动在轻微的刺激着他的大脑，令他的精神之海一下就变得活跃起来了。\n\n    是的，他能感受到自己精神之海的变化。那是因为在跟随娜娜修炼的时候，每一次娜娜都会带着他进入到精神之海中。\n\n    “精神力……”宣布数据的老师突然停顿了。\n\n    牧重天道：“怎么了？”\n\n    那位老师的声音有些变化，充满了震惊，“牧老师，你看看吧。”\n\n    牧重天来到屏幕前，当他看到上面的数据时，整个人也是吓了一跳。两位数是没错，可是，却是两位数的巅峰。\n\n    九十九！\n\n    “要不要重新测试一下？”负责仪器的老师问道。\n\n    牧重天摇摇头，“不用了，仪器不会出问题的。蓝轩宇，精神力九十九，灵通境。”\n\n    精神力零到五十是灵元境，五十到两百为灵通境。\n\n    灵通境，心神通灵，意达念至，达到灵通境，精神力掌控开始入门，真正操控自己的精神力为己所用，能够承载两个黄色魂灵或者一个紫色魂灵。\n\n    八岁，灵通境，近百的精神力，这意味着什么？\n\n    这孩子魂力虽然弱了一点，可这精神力却绝对可以用惊才绝艳来形容啊！\n\n    但牧重天并没有多做夸奖，因为，前面的两项测试只是最基础的数据而已。\n\n    “准备进入模拟舱，开始综合测试。你们的武魂、实战能力以及各方面的素质，都将在最后的考核中完成。尽可能的展现自我，你\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
