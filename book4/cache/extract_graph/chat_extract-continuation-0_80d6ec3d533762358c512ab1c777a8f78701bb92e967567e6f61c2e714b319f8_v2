头。这次他来省上，是专门想弄几个钱，为他和他周围的几位诗友出诗集的。也正是在他的缠磨下，黑老才不得不亲自出马来找吴斌。一来黑老对黄原有感情，二来贾冰给他拿来一堆土特产，不办事就对不起人了。 \n　　古风铃仍然是那副满不在乎的样子；甚至还轻松地喷吐着烟圈。 \n　　这个人不熬煎自己的诗没地方出版。他之所以也跟黑老跑这趟，一是想见识一下省委领导住的地方，二是为了上次在黄原和他睡过觉的杜丽丽；丽丽也想“出版”一本她的诗集，并且托贾冰捎了一封信给他，让他帮助解决经费问题。他屁也解决不了！好在黑老愿为黄原这群可怜的诗人出马要钱，他跟上跑一趟，也算对那个多情的女人尽了点心。不管怎样，她上次使他的黄原之行充满了愉快，回来写了好几组诗哩！在写诗方面，他瞧不起杜丽丽。哼，他们还都是那种老掉牙的办法，崇拜白开水一样的普希金！尤其是贾冰，还在歌唱什么黄土地哩！ \n　　这时候，吴斌看黑老陷入窘态，赶忙和颜悦色地说：“内参是内参，但文化事业我们还是要大力支持嘛！要大力搞好我们的社会主义精神文明哩！这样吧，你先不要着急，让我再想想办法。你知道，我给你拿不出钱，还得要通过政府那面才行。现在不是有人说，党委有权，政府有钱嘛！”黑老精神一下缓了过来，马上补充说：“还有哩，说政协发言，人大举拳！” \n　　众人大笑之后，黑老接着恭维了一番吴书记，又攻击了那个叫高朗的记者，并说：“维山我认识，我罢了找他，叫他好好管管他的儿子！” \n　　这时，省纪监委书记苗凯到了。 \n　　黑白一行人就起身向吴斌告辞。苗凯也认识黑白，两个人一般性地握了握手，没话找话寒喧了几句。苗凯知道黑白是田福军的朋友，因此对这位倚老卖老的文人很不感冒。 \n　　送走黑白一行人后，吴斌就和苗凯在客厅里谈起了他们的事。 \n　　两个人所谈的是他们共同关心的高凤阁同志的命运。 \n　　去年南部那个城市被洪水淹没后，渎职的行署专员高凤阁就成了被追查责任的主要对象。 \n　　事件发生后不久，中央纪律监察委员会专门派工作组来，会同省纪监委一起追查这次特大洪水灾害中的领导责任。当然，所有的地市领导都有责任。但最严重的是专员高凤阁同志；他作为地区防汛总指挥部，竟然在最紧急的关头，跑回家为儿子操办婚事去了！ \n　　本来，查清责任并不难，但这件事快拖了一年还不能进行最后处理。 \n　　问题的结�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>吴斌<|>PERSON<|>吴斌 is a key figure involved in supporting
