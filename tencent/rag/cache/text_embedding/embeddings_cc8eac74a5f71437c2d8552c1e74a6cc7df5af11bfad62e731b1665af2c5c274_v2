Fairness, yes. They have this homily: ‘Those against whom judgment is passed must accept the fairness of it.’”\n“So they condition you to accept their judgment.”\n“There are loopholes in any system.”\n“You know, darling, acolytes learn things.”\n“That’s why they’re acolytes.”\n“I mean we talk to one another.”\n“We? You're an acolyte? You’re a proselyte!”\n“Whatever | am, I’ve heard stories. Your Teg may not be what he seems.”\n“Acolyte gossip.”\n“There are stories out of Gammu, Duncan.”\nHe stared at her. Gammu? He could never think of it by any name other than the original: Giedi Prime. Harkonnen\nhell hole.\nShe took his silence as an invitation to continue. “They say Teg moved faster than the eye could see, that he...”\n“Probably started those stories himself.”\n“Some Sisters don’t discount them. They’re taking a wait- and-see attitude. They want precautions.”\n“Haven't you learned anything about Teg from your precious histories? It would be typical of him to start such rumors. Make people cautious.”\n“But remember | was on Gammu then. Honored Matres were very upset. Enraged. Something went wrong.”\n“Sure. Teg did the unexpected. Surprised them. Stole one of their no-ships.” He patted the wall beside him. “This one.”\n“The Sisterhood has its forbidden ground, Duncan. They’re always telling me to wait for the Agony. All will become clear! Damn them!”\n“Sounds like they’re preparing you for the Missionaria teaching. Engineer religions for specific purposes and selected populations.”\n“You don’t see anything wrong in that?”\n“Morality. | don’t argue that with Reverend Mothers.”\n“Why not?”\n“Religions founder on that rock. BGs don’t founder.”\nDuncan, if you only knew their morality! “It annoys them that you Know so much about them.”\n“Bell only wanted to kill me because of it.”\n“You don’t think Odrade is just as bad?”\n“What a question!” Odrade? A terrifying woman if you let yourself dwell on her abilities. Atreides, for all that. I’ve known Atreides and Atreides. This one is Bene Gesserit first. Teg’s the Atreides ideal.\n“Odrade told me she trusts your loyalty to the Atreides.”\n“I’m loyal to Atreides honor, Murbella.” And I make my own moral decisions—about the Sisterhood, about this child\nthey’ve thrust into my care, about Sheeana and... and about my beloved.\nMurbella bent close to him, breast brushing his arm, and whispered in his ear. “Sometimes, | could kill any of them within my reach!”\nDoes she think they can’t hear? He sat upright, dragging her with him. “What set you off?”\n“She wants me to work on Scytale.”\nWork on. Honored Matre euphemism. Well, why not? She “worked on” plenty of men before she ran afoul of me. But he had an antique husband’s reaction. Not only that... Scytale? A damned Tleilaxu?\n“Mother Superior?” He had to be Sure.\n“The one, the only.” Almost lighthearted now that she had unburdened herself.\n“What’s your reaction?”\n“She says it was your idea.”\n“My ...No way! | suggested we could try to pry information out of him but...”\n“She says it’s an ordinary thing for the Bene Gesserit just as it is with Honored Matres. Go breed with this one. Seduce that one. All in a day’s work.”\n“I asked for your reaction.”\n“Revolted.” “Why?” Knowing your background... “It’s you I love, Duncan and... and my body is... is to\ngive you pleasure... just as you...”\n“We're an old married couple and the witches are trying to pry us apart.”\nHis words ignited in him a clear vision of Lady Jessica, lover of his long-dead Duke and mother of Maud’Dib. / loved her. She didn’t love me but... The look he saw now in Murbella’s eyes, he had seen Jessica look at the Duke that way: blind, unswerving love. The thing the Bene Gesserit distrusted. Jessica had been softer than Murbella. Hard to\nthe core, though. And Odrade...she was hard at the beginning. Plasteel all the way.\nThen what of the times when he had suspected her of sharing human emotions? The way she spoke of the Bashar when they learned the old man was dead on Dune.\n“He was my father, you know.”\nMurbella dragged him out of reverie. “You may share their dream, whatever that is, but...”\n“Grow up, humans!”\n“What?”\n“That’s their dream. Start acting like adults and not like angry children in a schoolyard.”\n“Mama knows best?”\n“Yes ...1 believe she does.”\n“Is that how you really see them? Even when you call them witches?”\n“It’s a good word. Witches do mysterious things.”\n“You don’t believe it’s the long and severe training plus the spice and the Agony?”\n“What’s belief have to do with it? Unknowns create their own mystique.”\n“But you don’t think they trick people into doing what they want?”\n“Sure they do!”\n“Words as weapons, Voice, Imprinters.. .”\n“None as beautiful as you.”\n“What’s beauty, Duncan?”\n“There’re styles in beauty, sure.”\n“Exactly what she says. ‘Styles based on procreative roots buried so deeply in our racial psyche we dare not remove them.’ So they’ve thought of meddling there, Duncan.”\n“And they might dare anything?”\n“She says, ‘We won’t distort our progeny into what we judge to be non-human.’ They judge, they condemn.”\nHe thought of the alien figures in his vision. Face Dancers. And he asked: “Like the amoral Tleilaxu? Amoral—not human.”\n“I can almost hear the gears whirling in Odrade’s head. She and her Sisters—they watch, they listen, they tailor every response, everything calculated.”\nIs that what you want, my darling? He felt trapped. She was right and she was wrong. Ends justifying means? How could he justify losing Murbella?\n“You think them amoral?” he asked.\nIt was as though she did not hear. “Always asking themselves what to say next to get the desired response.”\n“What response?” Couldn’t she hear his pain?\n“You never know until too late!” She turned and looked at him. “Exactly like Honored Matres. Do you know how Honored Matres trapped me?”\nHe could not suppress awareness of how avidly the watchdogs would hang on Murbella’s next words.\n“I was picked off the streets after an Honored Matre sweep. | think the whole sweep was because of me. My mother was a great beauty but she was too old for them.”\n“A sweep?” The watchdogs would want me to ask.\n“They go through an area and people disappear. No bodies, nothing. Whole families vanish. It’s explained as punishment because people plot against them.”\n“How old were you?”\n“Three ... maybe four. | was playing with friends in an open place under trees. Suddenly, there was a lot of noise and shouting. We hid in a hole behind some rocks.”\nHe was caught in a vision of this drama.\n“The ground shook.” Her gaze went inward with the memory. “Explosions. After a while it was quiet and we peeked out. The whole corner where my house had been was a hole.”\n“You were orphaned?”\n“| remember my parents. He was a big, robust fellow. | think my mother was a servant somewhere. They wore uniforms for such jobs and | remember her in uniform.”\n“How can you be sure your parents were killed?”\n“The sweep is all | Know for sure but they’re always the Same. There was screaming and people running about. We were terrified.”\n“Why do you think the sweep was because of you?”\n“They do that sort of thing.”\nThey. What a victory the watchers would count in that one word.\nMurbella was still deep in memory. “I think my father refused to succumb to an Honored Matre. That was always considered dangerous. Big, handsome man... strong.”\n“So you hate them?”\n“Why?” Really surprised by his question. “Without that, | would never have been an Honored Matre.”\nHer callousness shocked him. “So it was worth anything!”\n“Love, do you resent whatever brought me to your side?”\nTouché! “But don’t you wish it had happened some other way?”\n“It happened.”\nWhat utter fatalism. He had never suspected this in her. Was it Honored Matre conditioning or something the Bene Gesserit did?\n“You were just a valuable addition to their stables.”\n“Right. Enticers, they called us. We recruited valuable males.”\n“And you did.”\n“| repaid their investment many times over.”\n“Do you realize how the Sisters will interpret this?”\n“Don’t make a big thing of it.”\n“So you're ready to work on Scytale?”\n“| didn’t say that. Honored Matres manipulated me without my consent. The Sisters need me and want to use me the same way. My price may be too high.”\nHe was a moment speaking past a dry throat. “Price?”\nShe glared at him. “You, you’re just part of my price. No working on Scytale. And more of their famous candor about why they need me!”\n“Careful, love. They might tell you.”\nShe turned an almost Bene Gesserit stare toward him. “How could you restore Teg’s memories without pain?”\nDamn! And just when he thought they were free of that slip. No escape. He could see in her eyes that she guessed.\nMurbella confirmed this. “Since | would not agree, I’m Sure you've discussed it with Sheeana.”\nHe could only nod. His Murbella had gone farther into the Sisterhood than he suspected. And she knew how his multiple ghola memories had been restored by her imprinting. He suddenly saw her as a Reverend Mother and wanted to cry out against it.\n“How does this make you different from Odrade?” she asked.\n“Sheeana was trained as an Imprinter.” His words felt empty even as he spoke.\n“That’s different from my training?” Accusing.\nAnger flared in him. “You'd prefer the pain? Like Bell?”\n“You'd prefer the defeat of the Bene Gesserit?” Voice milky soft.\nHe heard the distance in her tone, as though she already had retreated into the cold observational stance of the Sisterhood. They were freezing his lovely Murbella! There was still that vitality in her, though. It tore at him. She gave off an aura of health, especially in pregnancy. Vigor and boundless enjoyment of life. It glowed in her. The Sisters would take that and dampen it.\nShe became quiet under his watchful stare.\nDesperate, he wondered what he could do.\n“I had hoped we were being more open with each other lately,” she said. Another Bene Gesserit probe.\n“| disagree with many of their actions but | don’t distrust their motives,” he said.\n“I'll Know their motives if | live through the Agony.”\nHe went very still, caught in realization that she might not survive. Life without Murbella? Yawning emptiness deeper than anything he had ever imagined. Nothing in", "it?” Voice milky soft.\nHe heard the distance in her tone, as though she already had retreated into the cold observational stance of the Sisterhood. They were freezing his lovely Murbella! There was still that vitality in her, though. It tore at him. She gave off an aura of health, especially in pregnancy. Vigor and boundless enjoyment of life.

Life without Murbella? Yawning emptiness deeper than anything he had ever imagined. Nothing in his many lives compared with it. Without conscious volition, he reached out and caressed her back. Skin so soft and yet resilient.\n“Į love you too much, Murbella. That’s my Agony.”\nShe trembled under his touch.\nHe found himself wallowing in sentimentality, building an image of grief until he recalled a Mentat teacher’s words about “emotional binges.”\n“The difference between sentiment and sentimentality is easy to see. When you avoid killing somebody’s pet on the glazeway, that’s sentiment. If you swerve to avoid the pet and that causes you to kill pedestrians, that is sentimentality. ”\nShe took his caressing hand and pressed it against her lips.\n“Words plus body, more than either,” he whispered.\nHis words plunged her back into nightmare but now she went with a vengeance, aware of words as tools. She was filled with special relish for the experience, willingness to laugh at herself.\nAs she exorcised the nightmare, it occurred to her that she had never seen an Honored Matre laugh at herself.\nHolding his hand, she stared down at Duncan. Mentat flickering of his eyelids. Did he realize what she had just experienced? Freedom! It no longer was a question of how she had been confined and driven into inevitable channels by her past. For the first time since accepting the possiblity that she could become a Reverend Mother, she glimpsed what it might mean. She felt awe and shock.\nNothing more important than the Sisterhood?\nThey spoke of an oath, something more mysterious than the Proctor’s words at the acolyte initiation.\nMy oath to Honored Matres was only words. An oath to the Bene Gesserit can be no more.\nShe remembered Bellonda growling that diplomats were chosen for ability to lie. “Would you be another diplomat, Murbella?”\nIt was not that oaths were made to be broken. How childish! Schoolyard threat: “If you break your word, l'Il break mine! Nyaa, nyaa, nyaaaaa!”\nFutile to worry about oaths. Far more important to find that place in herself where freedom lived. It was a place where something always listened.\nCupping Duncan’s hand against her lips, she whispered: “They listen. Oh, how they listen.”\nEnter no conflict against fanatics unless you can defuse them. Oppose a religion with another religion only if your proofs (miracles) are irrefutable or if you can mesh in a way that the fanatics accept you as god-inspired. This has long been the barrier to science assuming a mantle of divine revelation. Science is so obviously man-made. Fanatics (and many are fanatic on one subject or another) must know where you stand, but more important, must recognize who whispers in your ear.\n—MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA, PRIMARY TEACHING\nhe flow of time nagged at Odrade as much as did\nconstant awareness of the hunters approaching. Years passed so quickly that days became a blur. Two months of arguments to gain approval of Sheeana as successor to Tam!\nBellonda had taken to standing day watch when Odrade was absent as she had been today, briefing a new Bene Gesserit remnant being sent Scattering. The Council continued this but with reluctance. Idaho’s suggestion that it was a futile strategy had sent shock waves through the Sisterhood. Briefings now carried new defensive plans for “what you may encounter.”\nWhen Odrade entered the workroom late in the afternoon, Bellonda sat at the table. Her cheeks looked puffy and her eyes had that hard stare they got when she suppressed fatigue. With Bell here, the daily summation would include sharp comments.\n“They've approved Sheeana,” she said, pushing a small crystal toward Odrade. “Tam’s support did it. And Murbella’s new one will be born in eight days, so the Suks claim.”\nBell had little faith in Suk doctors.\nNew one? She could be so damned impersonal about life! Odrade found her pulses quickening at the prospect.\nWhen Murbella recovers from this birth—the Agony. She Is ready.\n“Duncan’s extremely nervous,” Bellonda said, vacating the chair.\nDuncan yet! Those two are getting remarkably familiar.\nBell was not finished. “And before you ask, no word from Dortujla.”\nOdrade took her seat behind the table and balanced the report crystal on her palm. Dortujla’s trusted acolyte, now Reverend Mother Fintil, would not risk the no-ship journey or any of the other message devices they had prepared just to stroke a Mother Superior. No news meant the bait was still out there... or wasted.\n“Have you told Sheeana she’s confirmed?” Odrade asked.\n“| left that for you. She’s late with her daily report again. Not right for someone on the Council.”\nSo Bell still disapproved the appointment.\nSheeana’s daily messages had taken on a repetitious note. “No wormsign. Spice mass intact.”\nEverything upon which they pinned their hopes lay in terrible suspension. And nightmare hunters crept closer. Tensions accumulated. Explosive.\n“You've seen that exchange between Duncan and Murbella enough times,” Bellonda said. “Is that what Sheeana was hiding and, if so, why?”\n“Teg was my father.”\n“Such delicacy! A Reverend Mother has qualms about imprinting the ghola of Mother Superior’s father!”\n“She was my personal student, Bell. She has concerns for me you could not feel. Besides, this is not just a ghola, this is a child.”\n“We must be certain of her!”\nOdrade saw the name form on Bellonda’s lips but it remained unspoken. “Jessica.”\nAnother flawed Reverend Mother? Bell was right, they must be sure of Sheeana. My responsibility. A vision of Sheeana’s black sculpture flickered in Odrade’s awareness.\n“Idaho's plan has some attraction, but...” Bellonda hesitated.\nOdrade spoke up: “This is a very young child, growth incomplete. Pain of the usual memory restoration could approach the Agony. It might alienate him. But this...”\n“Control him with an Imprinter, that part | approve. But what if it doesn’t restore his memories?”\n“We still have the original plan. And it did have that effect on Idaho.”\n“Different for him but the decision can wait. You’re late for your meeting with Scytale.”\nOdrade hefted the crystal. “Daily summation?”\n“Nothing you haven’t seen too many times already.” From Bell, that was almost a note of concern.\n“I'll bring him back here. Have Tam waiting and you come in later on some pretext.”\nScytale had become almost accustomed to these walks outside the ship and Odrade observed this in his casual manner when they emerged from her transporter south of Central.\nIt was more than a stroll and they both knew it but she had made these excursions regular, designing repetition to lull him. Routine. So useful on occasion.\n“Kind of you to take me for these walks,” Scytale said, looking up sideways. “The air is drier than I recall it. Where do we go this evening?”\nHow tiny his eyes when he squinted against the sun.\n“To my workroom.” She nodded at outbuildings of Central about half a klick north. It was cold under a cloudless spring sky and warm colors of roofs, lights coming on in her tower, beckoned with promise of relief from a chilling wind that accompanied almost every sunset these days.\nWith peripheral attention, Odrade watched the Tleilaxu beside her carefully. Such tension! She could feel this also in guardian Reverend Mothers and acolytes close behind them, all charged to special watchfulness by Bellonda.\nWe need this little monster and he knows it. And we still don’t know the extent of Tleilaxu abilities! What talents has he accumulated? Why does he probe with such evident casualness for contact with his fellow prisoners?\nTleilaxu made the Idaho-ghola, she reminded herself. Did they hide secret things in him?\n“lam a beggar come to your door, Mother Superior,” he said in that whining elfin voice. “Our planets in ruins, my people slain. Why do we go to your quarters?”\n“To bargain in more pleasant surroundings.”\n“Yes, it is very confining in the ship. But | do not understand why we always leave the car so far away from Central. Why do we walk?”\n“I find it refreshing.”\nScytale glanced around him at the plantings. “Pleasant, but quite cold, don’t you think?”\nOdrade glanced to the south. These southern slopes were planted to grapes, crests and colder northern faces reserved for orchards. Improved vinifera, these vineyards. Developed by Bene Gesserit gardeners. Old vines, roots “gone down to hell” where (according to ancient superstition) they stole water from burning souls. The winery was underground as were storage and aging caves. Nothing to mar a landscape of tended vines in orderly rows, plantings just far enough apart for pickers and tilling equipment.\nPleasant to him? She doubted Scytale saw anything pleasing here. He was properly nervous as she wanted him to be, asking himself: Why does she really choose to walk me through these rustic surroundings?\nIt galled Odrade that they dared not employ more powerful Bene Gesserit persuasives on this little man. But she agreed with advice that said if those efforts failed, they\nwould not get a second chance. Tleilaxu had demonstrated they would die rather than give up secret (and sacred) knowledge.\n“Several things puzzle me,” Odrade said, picking her way around a pile of vine trimmings as she spoke. “Why do you insist on having your own Face Dancers before acceding to our requests? And what is this interest in Duncan Idaho?”\n“Dear lady, | have no companions in my loneliness. That answers both questions.” He rubbed absently at his breast where the nullentropy capsule lay concealed.\nWhy does he rub himself there so frequently? It was a gesture she and analysts had puzzled over. No scar, no skin inflammation. Perhaps merely a carryover from childhood. But that was so long ago! A flaw in this reincarnation? No one could say. And that gray skin carried a metallic pigmentation that resisted probing instruments. He was sure to have been sensitized to heavier rays and would know those were used. No... now, it was all diplomacy. Damn this little monster!\nScytale wondered: Did this powindah female have no natural sympathies on which he could play? Typica/s were ambivalent on that question.\n“The Wekht of Jandola is no more,” he said. “Billions", "ancers before acceding to our requests? And what is this interest in Duncan Idaho?”\n“Dear lady, | have no companions in my loneliness. That answers both questions.” He rubbed absently at his breast where the nullentropy capsule lay concealed.\nWhy does he rub himself there so frequently? It was a gesture she and analysts had puzzled over. No scar, no skin inflammation. Perhaps merely a carryover from childhood. But that was so long ago! A flaw in this reincarnation? No one could say. And that gray skin carried a metallic pigmentation that resisted probing instruments. He was sure to have been sensitized to heavier rays and would know those were used. No... now, it was all diplomacy. Damn this little monster!\nScytale wondered: Did this powindah female have no natural sympathies on which he could play? Typica/s were ambivalent on that question.\n“The Wekht of Jandola is no more,” he said. “Billions of us Slain by those whores. To the farthest reaches of the Yaghist, we are destroyed and only | remain.”\nYaghist, she thought. Land of the unruled. It was a revealing word in Islamiyat, the Bene Tleilax language.\nIn that language, she said: “The magic of our God is our only bridge.”\nOnce more she claimed to share his Great Belief, the Sufi- Zensunni ecumenism that had spawned the Bene Tleilax. She spoke the language flawlessly, knew the proper words, but he saw falsehoods. She calls God’s Messenger “Tyrant” and disobeys the most basic precepts!\nWhere did these women meet in kehl to feel the presence of God? If they truly sooke the Language of God, they would\nalready know what they sought from him with crude bargaining.\nAs they climbed the last slope to the paved landing at Central, Scytale called on God for help. The Bene Tleilax come to this! Why have You put this trial upon us? We are the last legalists of the Shariat and I, the last Master of my people, must seek answers from you, God, when You no longer can speak to me in kehl.\nOnce more in flawless Islamiyat, Odrade said: “You were betrayed by your own people, ones you sent into the Scattering. You have no more Malik brothers, only sisters.”\nThen where is your sagra chamber, powindah deceiver? Where is a deep and windowless place only brothers may enter?\n“This is a new thing for me,” he said. “Malik Sisters? Those two words have always been self-negating. Sisters cannot be Malik.”\n“Waff, your late Mahai and Abdi, had trouble with that. And he led your people almost to extinction.”\n“Almost? You know of survivors?” He could not keep excitement from his voice.\n“No Masters... but we hear of a few Domel and all in Honored Matre hands.”\nShe paused where the edge of a building would cut off their view of the setting sun in the next steps and, still in the secret language of the Tleilaxu, said: “The sun is not God.”\nThe dawn and sunset cry of the Mahai!\nScytale felt faith wavering as he followed her into an arched passage between two squat buildings. Her words were proper but only the Mahai and Abdi should utter them. In the shadowy passage, footsteps of their escort close behind, Odrade confounded him by saying: “Why did you not say the proper words? Are you not the last Master? Does that not make you Mahai and Abdl?”\n“I was not chosen so by Malik brothers.” It sounded weak even to him.\nOdrade summoned a liftfield and paused at the tubeslot. In Other Memory detail, she found kehl and its right of ghufran familiar—words whispered in the night by lovers of long-dead women. “And then we...” “And so if we speak these sacred words. . .” Ghufran! Acceptance and readmission of one who had ventured among powindah, the returned one begging pardon for contact with unimaginable sins of aliens. The Masheikh have met in kehl and felt the presence of their God!\nThe tubeslot opened. Odrade motioned Scytale and two guards ahead. As he passed, she thought: Something must give soon. We cannot play our little game to the end he desires.\nTamalane stood at the bow window, her back to the door, when Odrade and Scytale entered the workroom. Sunset light slanted sharply across the rooftops. The brilliance vanished then and left behind it a sense of contrast, the night darker because of that last glow along the horizon.\nIn the milky gloom, Odrade waved the guards away, noting their reluctance. Bellonda had charged them to stay, obviously, but they would not disobey Mother Superior. She indicated a chairdog across from her and waited for him to sit. He looked back suspiciously at Tamalane before sinking into the 'dog but covered it by saying: “Why are there no lights?”\n“This is a relaxing interlude,” she said. And I know darkness worries you!\nShe stood a moment behind her table, identifying bright patches in the gloom, a luster of artifacts placed around her to make this her setting: the bust of long-dead Chenoeh in its niche beside the window, and there on the wall at her right, a pastoral landscape from the first human migrations into space, a stack of ridulian crystals on the table anda\nsilvery reflection off her lightscribe concentrating faint illuminations from the windows.\nHe has roasted long enough.\nShe touched a plate on her console. Glowglobes set strategically around walls and ceiling came to life. Tamalane turned on cue, her robe swishing deliberately. She stood two paces behind Scytale, the very picture of ominous Bene Gesserit mystery.\nScytale twitched slightly at Tamalane’s movement but now he sat quietly. The chairdog was somewhat too large for him and he looked almost childlike there.\nOdrade said, “Sisters who rescued you say you commanded a no-ship at Junction preparing for the first foldspace leap when Honored Matres attacked. You were coming to your ship in a one-man skitter, they said, and veered away just before the explosions. You detected the attackers?”\n“Yes.” Reluctance in his voice.\n“And knew they might locate the no-ship from your trajectory. So you fled, leaving your brothers to be destroyed.”\nHe spoke with the utter bitterness of a tragic witness: “Earlier, when we were outbound from Tleilax, we saw that attack begin. Our explosions to destroy everything of value to attackers and the burners from space created the holocaust. We fled then, too.”\n“But not directly to Junction.”\n“Everywhere we searched, they had been before us. They had the ashes but | had our secrets.” Remind her that I still have something of value to trade! He tapped a finger against his head.\n“You sought Guild or CHOAM sanctuary at Junction,” she said. “How fortunate our spy ship was there to scoop you up before the enemy could react.”\n“Sister...” How difficult that word! “...if you truly are my sister in kehl, why will you not provide me with Face Dancer\nservants?”\n“Still too many secrets between us, Scytale. Why, for instance, were you leaving Bandalong when attackers came?”\nBandalong!\nNaming the great Tleilax city constricted his chest and he thought he felt the nullentropy capsule pulse, as though it sought release for its precious contents. Lost Bandalong. Never again to see the city of carnelian skies, never to feel the presence of brothers, of patient Domel and...\n“Are you ill?” Odrade asked.\n“lam sick with what I have lost!” He heard fabric slither behind him and sensed Tamalane closer. How oppressive it was in this place! “Why is she behind me?”\n“I am the servant of my Sisters and she is here to observe us both.”\n“You've taken some of my cells, haven’t you? You’re growing a replacement Scytale in your tanks!”\n“Of course we are. You don’t think Sisters would let the last Master end here, do you?”\n“No ghola of me will do anything | would not!” And it will carry no nullentropy tube!\n“We know.” But what is it we do not know?\n“This is not bargaining,” he complained.\n“You misjudge me, Scytale. We know when you lie and when you conceal. We employ senses others do not.”\nIt was true! They detected things from odors of his body, from small movements of muscles, expressions he could not suppress.\nSisters? These creatures are powindah! All of them!\n“You were on lashkar,” Odrade prodded.\nLashkar! How he wished he were here on lashkar. Face Dance warriors. Domel assistants—eliminating this abominable evil! But he dared not lie. The one behind him probably was a Truthsayer. Experience in many lives told him Bene Gesserit Truthsayers were the best.\n“| commanded a force of khasadars. We sought a herd of Futars for our defense.”\nHerd? Did Tleilaxu know something of Futars not revealed to the Sisterhood?\n“You went prepared for violence. Did Honored Matres learn of your mission and cut you off? | think it likely.”\n“Why do you call them Honored Matres?” His voice lapsed almost into a screech.\n“Because that is what they call themselves.” Very calm now. Let him stew in his own mistakes.\nShe is right! We were betrayed. Bitter thought. He held it close, wondering how he should reply. A small revelation? There is never a small revelation with these women.\nA sigh shook his breast. The nullentropy capsule and its contents. His most important concern. Anything to get him access to his own axlotl tanks.\n“Descendants of people we sent into the Scattering returned with captive Futars. A mingling of human and cat, as you doubtless know. But they did not reproduce in our tanks. And before we could determine why, the ones brought to us died.” The betrayers brought us only two! We should have suspected.\n“They didn’t bring you very many Futars, did they? You should have suspected they were bait.”\nSee? That is what they do with small revelations!\n“Why did the Futars not hunt and kill Honored Matres on Gammu?” It was Duncan’s question and deserved an answer.\n“We were told no orders were given. They do not kill without orders.” She knows this. She is testing me.\n“Face Dancers also kill on order,” she said. “They would even kill you if you ordered it. Not so?”\n“That order is reserved for keeping our secrets from the hands of enemies.”\n“Is that why you want your own Face Dancers? Do you consider us enemies?”\nBefore he could compose a response, Bellonda’s projected figure appeared above the table, lifesize and partly translucent, dancing crystals of Archives behind her. “Urgent from Sheeana!” Bellonda said. “The spice blow has occurred. Sandworms!” The figure turned and looked at Scytale, comeyes perfectly coordinating her movements. “So you have lost a bargaining chip, Master Scytale! We have our spice at last!” The projected figure vanished with an audible click and a faint smell of ozone.\n“You're trying to trick me!” he blurted.\nBut the door at Odrade’s left opened. Sheeana entered towing a small Suspensor pod no more than two meters long"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_cc8eac74a5f71437c2d8552c1e74a6cc7df5af11bfad62e731b1665af2c5c274_v2"}
