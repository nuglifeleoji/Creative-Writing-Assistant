敢小觑我！”方欲交兵，刘表便退。坚纵马赶去，两山后伏兵齐起，背后蔡瑁、蒯越赶来，将孙坚困在垓心。正是：玉玺得来无用处，反因此宝动刀兵。毕竟孙坚怎地脱身，且听下文分解。\n\n\n\n第七回 袁绍磐河战公孙 孙坚跨江击刘表\n\n    \t\t\n\n    却说孙坚被刘表围住，亏得程普、黄盖、韩当三将死救得脱，折兵大半，夺路引兵回江东。自此孙坚与刘表结怨。\n\n    且说袁绍屯兵河内，缺少粮草。冀州牧韩馥，遣人送粮以资军用。谋士逢纪说绍曰：“大丈夫纵横天下，何待人送粮为食！冀州乃钱粮广盛之地，将军何不取之？”绍曰：“未有良策。”纪曰：“可暗使人驰书与公孙瓒，令进兵取冀州，约以夹攻，瓒必兴兵。韩馥无谋之辈，必请将军领州事；就中取事，唾手可得。”绍大喜，即发书到瓒处。瓒得书，见说共攻冀州，平分其地，大喜，即日兴兵。\n\n    绍却使人密报韩馥。馥慌聚荀谌、辛评二谋士商议。谌曰：“公孙瓒将燕、代之众，长驱而来，其锋不可当。兼有刘备、关、张助之，难以抵敌。今袁本初智勇过人，手下名将极广，将军可请彼同治州事，彼必厚待将军，无患公孙瓒矣。”韩馥即差别驾关纯去请袁绍。长史耿武谏曰：“袁绍孤客穷军，仰我鼻息，譬如婴儿在股掌之上，绝其乳哺，立可饿死。奈何欲以州事委之？此引虎入羊群也。”馥曰：“吾乃袁氏之故吏，才能又不如本初。古者择贤者而让之，诸君何嫉妒耶？”耿武叹曰：“冀州休矣！”于是弃职而去者三十余人。独耿武与关纯伏于城外，以待袁绍。\n\n    数日后，绍引兵至。耿武、关纯拔刀而出，欲刺杀绍。绍将颜良立斩耿武，文丑砍死关纯。绍入冀州，以馥为奋威将军，以田丰、沮授、许攸、逢纪分掌州事，尽夺韩馥之权。馥懊悔无及，遂弃下家小，匹马往投陈留太守张邈去了。\n\n    却说公孙瓒知袁绍已据冀州，遣弟公孙越来见绍，欲分其地。绍曰：“可请汝兄自来，吾有商议。”越辞归。行不到五十里，道旁闪出一彪军马，口称：“我乃董丞相家将也！”乱箭射死公孙越。从人逃回见公孙瓒，报越已死。瓒大怒曰：“袁绍诱我起兵攻韩馥，他却就里取事；今又诈董卓兵射死�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
