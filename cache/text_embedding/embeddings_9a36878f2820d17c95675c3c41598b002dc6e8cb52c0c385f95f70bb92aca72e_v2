pain | could not relieve,” he said. “I would run then, run like an insane creature across the dunes.”\n“You... ran?”\n“My legs were longer in proportion to my body in those days. | could move myself about quite easily. But the hungry pain has never left me. | think it’s hunger for my lost humanity.”\nHe saw the beginnings of reluctant sympathy in her, the questioning.\n“You still have this... pain?”\n“It’s only a soft burning now. That’s one of the signs of my final metamorphosis. In a few hundred years, l'Il be back under the sand.”\nHe saw her clench her fists at her sides. “Why?” she demanded. “Why did you do this?”\n“This change isn’t all bad. Today, for example, has been very pleasant. | feel quite mellow.”\n“There are changes we cannot see,” she said. “I know there must be.” She relaxed her hands.\n“My sight and hearing have become extremely acute, but not my sense of touch. Except for my face, | don’t feel things the way | could once. | miss that.”\nAgain, he noted the reluctant sympathy, the striving toward an empathic understanding. She wanted to know!\n“When you live so long,” she said, “how does the passage of Time feel? Does it move more rapidly as the years go by?”\n“That’s a strange thing, Siona. Sometimes, Time rushes by me; sometimes, it creeps.”\nGradually, as they spoke, Leto had been dimming the concealed lights of his aerie, moving his cart closer and closer to Siona. Now, he shut off the lights, leaving only the moon. The front of his cart protruded onto the balcony, his face only about two meters from Siona.\n“My father tells me,” she said, “that the older you get, the slower your time goes. Is that what you told him?”\nTesting my veracity, he thought. She’s not a Truthsayer, then.\n“All things are relative, but compared to the human time- sense, this is true.”\n“Why?”\n“It is involved in what | will become. At the end, Time will stop for me and | will be frozen like a pearl caught in ice. My new bodies will scatter, each with a pearl hidden within it.”\nShe turned and looked away from him, peering out at the desert, speaking without looking at him.\n“When I talk to you like this here in the darkness | can almost forget what you are.”\n“That’s why I chose this hour for our meeting.”\n“But why this place?”\n“Because it is the last place where | can feel at home.”\nSiona turned against the rail, leaning on it and looking at him. “I want to see you.”\nHe turned on all of the aerie’s lights, including the harsh white globes along the roof of the balcony’s outer edge. As the light came on, an Ixian-made transparent mask slid out of wall recesses and sealed off the balcony behind Siona. She felt it move behind her and was startled, but nodded as though she understood. She thought it was a defense against attack. It was not. The wall merely kept out the damp insects of the night.\nSiona stared at Leto, sweeping her gaze along his body, pausing at the stubs which once had been his legs, bringing her attention then to his arms and hands, then to his face.\n“Your approved histories tell us that all Atreides are descended from you and your sister, Ghanima,” she said. “The Oral History disagrees.”\n“The Oral History is correct. Your ancestor was Harq al- Ada. Ghani and | were married only in name, a move to consolidate the power.”\n“Like your marriage to this Ixian woman?”\n“That is different.”\n“You will have children?”\n“I have never been capable of having children. | chose the metamorphosis before that was possible.”\n“You were a child and then you were”—she pointed — “this?”\n“Nothing between.”\n“How does a child know what to choose?”\n“I was one of the oldest children this universe has ever seen. Ghani was the other.”\n“That story about your ancestral memories!”\n“A true story. We’re all here. Doesn’t the Oral History agree?”\nShe whirled away and held her back stiffly presented to him. Once more, Leto found himself fascinated by this human gesture: rejection coupled to vulnerability. Presently, she turned around and concentrated on his features within the hooded folds.\n“You have the Atreides look,” she said.\n“I come by it just as honestly as you do.”\n“You're so old... why aren’t you wrinkled?”\n“Nothing about the human part of me ages in a normal way.”\n“Is that why you did this to yourself?”\n“To enjoy long life? No.”\n“| don’t see how anyone could make such a choice,” she muttered. Then louder: “Never to know love...”\n“You're playing the fool!” he said. “You don’t mean love, you mean sex.”\nShe shrugged.\n“You think the most terrible thing | gave up was sex? No, the greatest loss was something far different.”\n“What?” She asked it reluctantly, betraying how deeply he touched her.\n“I cannot walk among my fellows without their special notice. | am no longer one of you. | am alone. Love? Many people love me, but my shape keeps us apart. We are\nseparated, Siona, by a gulf that no other human dares to bridge.”\n“Not even your Ixian woman?”\n“Yes, she would if she could, but she cannot. She’s not an Atreides.”\n“You mean that I|... could?” She touched her breast with a finger.\n“If there were enough sandtrout around. Unfortunately, all of them enclose my flesh. However, if | were to die...”\nShe shook her head in dumb horror at the thought.\n“The Oral History tells it accurately,” he said. “And we must never forget that you believe the Oral History.”\nShe continued to shake her head from side to side.\n“There’s no secret about it,” he said. “The first moments of the transformation are the critical ones. Your awareness must drive inward and outward simultaneously, one with Infinity. | could provide you with enough melange to accomplish this. Given enough spice, you can live through those first awful moments... and all the other moments.”\nShe shuddered uncontrollably, her gaze fixed on his eyes.\n“You know I’m telling you the truth, don’t you?”\nShe nodded, inhaled a deep trembling breath, then: “Why did you do it?”\n“The alternative was far more horrible.”\n“What alternative?”\n“In time, you may understand it. Moneo did.”\n“Your damned Golden Path!”\n“Not damned at all. Quite holy.”\n“You think I’m a fool who can’t...”\n“I think you’re inexperienced, but possessed of great Capability whose potential you do not even suspect.”\nShe took three deep breaths and regained some of her composure, then: “If you can’t mate with the Ixian, what...”\n“Child, why do you persist in misunderstanding? It’s not sex. Before Hwi, | could not pair. | had no other like me. In all\nof the cosmic void, | was the only one.”\n“She’s like... you?”\n“Deliberately so. The Ixians made her that way.”\n“Made her...”\n“Don’t be a complete fool!” he snapped. “She is the essential god-trap. Even the victim cannot reject her.”\n“Why do you tell me these things?” she whispered.\n“You stole two copies of my journals,” he said. “You’ve read the Guild translations and you already know what could catch me.”\n“You knew?”\nHe saw boldness return to her stance, a sense of her own power. “Of course you knew,” she said, answering her own question.\n“It was my secret,” he said. “You cannot imagine how many times | have loved a companion and seen that companion slip away ... as your father is slipping away now.”\n“You love... him?”\n“And | loved your mother. Sometimes they go quickly; sometimes with agonizing slowness. Each time | am wracked. | can play callous and | can make the necessary decisions, even decisions which kill, but | cannot escape the suffering. For a long, long time—those journals you stole tell it truly—that was the only emotion | knew.”\nHe saw the moistness in her eyes, but the line of her jaw still spoke of angry resolution.\n“None of this gives you the right to govern,” she said.\nLeto suppressed a smile. At last they were down to the root of Siona’s rebellion.\nBy what right? Where is justice in my rule? By imposing my rules upon them with the weight of Fish Speaker arms, am l being fair to the evolutionary thrust of humankind? | know all of the revolutionary cant, the catch-prattle and the resounding phrases.\n“Nowhere do you see your own rebellious hand in the power | wield,” he said.\nHer youth still demanded its moment.\n“| never chose you to govern,” she said.\n“But you strengthen me.”\n“How?”\n“By opposing me. | sharpen my claws on the likes of you.”\nShe shot a sudden glance at his hands.\n“A figure of speech,” he said.\n“So I’ve offended you at last,” she said, hearing only the cutting anger in his words and tone.\n“You've not offended me. We’re related and can speak bluntly to each other within the family. The fact is, | have much more to fear from you than you from me.”\nThis took her aback, but only momentarily. He saw belief stiffen her shoulders, then doubt. Her chin lowered and she peered upward at him.\n“What could the great God Leto fear from me?”\n“Your ignorant violence.”\n“Are you saying that you’re physically vulnerable?”\n“I will not warn you again, Siona. There are limits to the word games | will play. You and the Ixians both know that it’s the ones | love who are physically vulnerable. Soon, most of the Empire will know it. This is the kind of information which travels fast.”\n“And they'll a/l ask what right you have to rule!”\nThere was glee in her voice. It aroused an abrupt anger in Leto. He found it difficult to suppress. This was a side of human emotions he detested. G/oating! It was some time before he dared answer, then he chose to slash through her defenses at the vulnerability he already had seen.\n“I rule by the right of loneliness, Siona. My loneliness is part-freedom and part-slavery. It says | cannot be bought by any human group. My slavery to you says that | will serve all of you to the best of my lordly abilities.”\n“But the Ixians have caught you!” she said.\n“No. They have given me a gift which strengthens me.”\n“It weakens you!”\n“That, too,” he admitted. “But very powerful forces still obey me.”\n“Ohhh, yes.” She nodded. “I understand that.”\n“You don’t understand it.”\n“Then I’m sure you'll explain it to me,” she taunted.\nHe spoke so softly that she had to lean toward him to hear: “There are no others of any kind anywhere who can call upon me for anything—not for sharing, not for compromise, not even for the slightest beginning of another government. | am the only one.”\n“Not even this xian woman can...”\n“She is so much like me that she would not weaken me in that way.”\n“But when the Ixian Embassy was attacked .. .”\n“Į can still be irritated by stupidity,” he said.\nShe scowled at him.\nLeto thought it", "ly abilities.”\n“But the Ixians have caught you!” she said.\n“No. They have given me a gift which strengthens me.”\n“It weakens you!”\n“That, too,” he admitted. “But very powerful forces still obey me.”\n“Ohhh, yes.” She nodded. “I understand that.”\n“You don’t understand it.”\n“Then I’m sure you'll explain it to me,” she taunted.\nHe spoke so softly that she had to lean toward him to hear: “There are no others of any kind anywhere who can call upon me for anything—not for sharing, not for compromise, not even for the slightest beginning of another government. | am the only one.”\n“Not even this xian woman can...”\n“She is so much like me that she would not weaken me in that way.”\n“But when the Ixian Embassy was attacked .. .”\n“Į can still be irritated by stupidity,” he said.\nShe scowled at him.\nLeto thought it a pretty gesture in that light, quite unconscious. He knew he had made her think. He was sure she had never before considered that any rights might adhere to uniqueness.\nHe addressed her silent scowl: “There has never before been a government exactly like mine. Not in all of our history. | am responsible only to myself, exacting payment in full for what | have sacrificed.”\n“Sacrificed!” she sneered, but he heard the doubts. “Every despot says something like that. You’re responsible only to yourself!”\n“Which makes every living thing my responsibility. | watch over you through these times.”\n“Through what times?”\n“The times that might have been and then no more.”\nHe saw the indecision in her. She did not trust her instincts, her untrained abilities at prediction. She might leap occasionally as she had done when she took his\njournals, but the motivation for the leap was lost in the revelation which followed.\n“My father says you can be very tricky with words,” she said.\n“And he ought to know. But there is knowledge you can only gain by participating in it. There’s no way to learn it by standing off and looking and talking.”\n“That’s the kind of thing he means,” she said.\n“You're quite right,” he agreed. “It’s not logical. But itis a light, an eye which can see, but does not see itself.”\n“I’m tired of talking,” she said.\n“As am |.” And he thought: / have seen enough, done enough. She is wide open to her doubts. How vulnerable they are in their ignorance!\n“You haven't convinced me of anything,” she said.\n“That was not the purpose of this meeting.”\n“What was the purpose?”\n“To see if you are ready to be tested.”\n“Test...” She tipped her head a bit to the right and stared at him.\n“Don’t play the innocent with me,” he said. “Moneo has told you. And | tell you that you are ready!”\nShe tried to swallow, then: “What are...”\n“| have sent for Moneo to return you to the Citadel,” he said. “When we meet again, we will really learn what you are made of.”\nYou know the myth of the Great Spice Hoard? Yes, | know about that story, too. A majordomo brought it to me one day to amuse me. The story says there is a hoard of melange, a gigantic hoard, big as a great mountain. The hoard is concealed in the depths of a distant planet. It is not Arrakis, that planet. It is not Dune. The spice was hidden there long ago, even before the First Empire and the Spacing Guild. The story says Paul Muad’Dib went there and lives yet beside the hoard, kept alive by it, waiting. The majordomo did not understand why the story disturbed me.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho trembled with anger as he strode along the gray\nplastone halls toward his quarters in the Citadel. At each guard post he passed, the woman there snapped to attention. He did not respond. Idaho knew he was causing disturbance among them. Nobody could mistake the Commander’s mood. But he did not abate his purposeful stride. The heavy thumping of his boots echoed along the walls.\nHe could still taste the noon meal—oddly familiar Atreides chopstick-fare of mixed grains herb-seasoned and baked around a pungent morsel of pseudomeat, all of it washed down with a drink of clear cidrit juice. Moneo had found him at table in the Guard Mess, alone in a corner with a regional operations schedule propped up beside his plate.\nWithout invitation, Moneo had seated himself opposite Idaho and had pushed aside the operations schedule.\n“I bring a message from the God Emperor,” Moneo said.\nThe tightly controlled tone warned Idaho that this was no casual encounter. Others sensed it. Listening silence settled over the women at nearby tables, spreading out through the room.\nIdaho put down his chopsticks. “Yes?”\n“These were the words of the God Emperor,” Moneo said. “It is my bad luck that Duncan Idaho should become enamored of Hwi Noree. This mischance must not continue.’”\nAnger thinned Idaho’s lips, but he remained silent.\n“Such foolishness endangers us all,” Moneo said. “Noree is the God Emperor’s intended.”\nIdaho tried to control his anger, but the words were a betrayal: “He can’t marry her!”\n“Why not?”\n“What game is he playing, Moneo?”\n“lam a messenger with a single message, no more,” Moneo said.\nIdaho’s voice was low and threatening. “But he confides in you.”\n“The God Emperor sympathizes with you,” Moneo lied.\n“Sympathizes!” Idaho shouted the word, creating a new depth to the room’s silence.\n“Noree is a woman of obvious attractions,” Moneo said. “But she is not for you.”\n“The God Emperor has spoken,” Idaho sneered, “and there is no appeal.”\n“I see that you understand the message,” Moneo said.\nIdaho started to push himself away from the table.\n“Where are you going?” Moneo demanded.\n“I’m going to have this out with him right now!”\n“That is certain suicide,” Moneo said.\nIdaho glared at him, aware suddenly of the listening intensity in the women at the tables around them. An expression which Muad’Dib would have recognized immediately came over Idaho’s face: “Playing to the Devil’s Gallery,” Muad’Dib had called it.\n“D’you know what the original Atreides Dukes always said?” Idaho asked. There was a mocking tone in his voice.\n“Is it pertinent?”\n“They said your liberties all vanish when you look up to any absolute ruler.”\nRigid with fear, Moneo leaned toward Idaho. Moneo’s lips barely moved. His voice was little more than a whisper. “Don’t say such things.”\n“Because one of these women will report it?”\nMoneo shook his head in disbelief. “You are more reckless than any of the others.”\n“Really?”\n“Please! It is perilous in the extreme to take this attitude.”\nIdaho heard the nervous stirring that swept through the room.\n“He can only kill us,” Idaho said.\nMoneo spoke in a tight whisper: “You fool! The Worm can dominate him at the slightest provocation!”\n“The Worm, you say?” Idaho’s voice was unnecessarily loud.\n“You must trust him,” Moneo said.\nIdaho glanced left and right. “Yes, | think they heard that.”\n“He is billions upon billions of people united in that one body,” Moneo said.\n“So I’ve been told.”\n“He is God and we are mortal,” Moneo said.\n“How is it a god can do evil things?” Idaho asked.\nMoneo thrust his chair backward and leaped to his feet. “l wash my hands of you!” Whirling away, he dashed from the room.\nIdaho looked out into the room, finding himself the center of attention for all of the guards’ faces.\n“Moneo doesn’t judge, but | do,” Idaho said.\nIt surprised him then to glimpse a few wry smiles among the women. They all returned to their eating.\nAs he strode down the hall of the Citadel, Idaho replayed the conversation, seeking out the oddities in Moneo’s behavior. The terror could be recognized and even\nunderstood, but it had seemed far more than fear of death... far, far more.\nThe Worm can dominate him.\nIdaho felt that this had slipped out of Moneo, an inadvertent betrayal. What could it mean?\nMore reckless than any of the others.\nIt galled Idaho that he should have to bear comparisons to himself-as-an-unknown. How careful had the others been?\nIdaho came to his own door, put a hand on the palm-lock and hesitated. He felt like a hunted animal retreating to his den. The guards in the mess surely would have reported that conversation to Leto by now. What would the God Emperor do? Idaho’s hand moved across the lock. The door swung inward. He entered the anteroom of his apartment and sealed the door, looking at it.\nWill he send his Fish Speakers for me?\nIdaho glanced around the entry area. It was a conventional space—racks for clothing and shoes, a full- length mirror, a weapons cupboard. He looked at the closed door of the cupboard. Not one of the weapons behind that door offered any real threat to the God Emperor. There wasn’t even a lasgun... although even lasguns were ineffectual against the Worm, according to all the accounts.\nHe knows | will defy him.\nIdaho sighed and looked toward the arched portal which led into the sitting area. Moneo had replaced the soft furniture with heavier, stiffer pieces, some of them recognizably Fremen—culled from the coffers of the Museum Fremen.\nMuseum Fremen!\nIdaho spat and strode through the portal. Two steps into the room he stopped, shocked. The soft light from the north windows revealed Hwi Noree seated on the low sling-divan. She wore a shimmering blue gown which draped itself revealingly around her figure. Hwi looked up at his entrance.\n“Thank the gods you’ve not been harmed,” she said.\nIdaho glanced back at his entry, at the palm-locked door. He returned a speculative look at Hwi. No one but a few selected guards should be able to open that door.\nShe smiled at his confusion. “We Ixians manufactured those locks,” she said.\nHe found himself filled with fear for her. “What are you doing here?”\n“We must talk.”\n“About what?”\n“Duncan...” She shook her head. “About us.”\n“They warned you,” he said.\n“I’ve been told to reject you.”\n“Moneo sent you!”\n“Two guardswomen who overheard you in the mess—they brought me. They think you are in terrible danger.”\n“Is that why you’re here?”\nShe stood, one graceful motion which reminded him of the way Leto’s grandmother, Jessica, had moved—the same fluid control of muscles, every movement beautiful.\nRealization came as a shock. “You're Bene Gesserit...”\n“No! They were among my teachers, but | am not Bene Gesserit.”\nSuspicions clouded his mind. What allegiances were really at work in Leto’s Empire? What does a ghola know about such things?\nThe changes since last I lived...\n“I suppose you're still just a simple Ixian,” he said.\n“Please don’t sneer at me, Duncan.”\n“What are you?”\n“lam the intended bride of the God Emperor", ".”\n“They warned you,” he said.\n“I’ve been told to reject you.”\n“Moneo sent you!”\n“Two guardswomen who overheard you in the mess—they brought me. They think you are in terrible danger.”\n“Is that why you’re here?”\nShe stood, one graceful motion which reminded him of the way Leto’s grandmother, Jessica, had moved—the same fluid control of muscles, every movement beautiful.\nRealization came as a shock. “You're Bene Gesserit...”\n“No! They were among my teachers, but | am not Bene Gesserit.”\nSuspicions clouded his mind. What allegiances were really at work in Leto’s Empire? What does a ghola know about such things?\nThe changes since last I lived...\n“I suppose you're still just a simple Ixian,” he said.\n“Please don’t sneer at me, Duncan.”\n“What are you?”\n“lam the intended bride of the God Emperor.”\n“And you'll serve him faithfully!”\n“T will.”\n“Then there’s nothing for us to talk about.”\n“Except this thing between us.”\nHe cleared his throat. “What thing?”\n“This attraction.” She raised a hand as he started to speak. “I want to hurl myself into your arms, to find the love and shelter | know is there. You want it, too.”\nHe held himself rigid. “The God Emperor forbids!”\n“But | am here.” She took two steps toward him, the gown rippling across her body.\n“Hwi...” He tried to swallow in a dry throat. “It’s best you leave.”\n“Prudent, but not best,” she said.\n“If he finds that you’ve been here...”\n“It is not my way to leave you like this.” Again, she stopped his response with a lifted hand. “I was bred and trained for just one purpose.”\nHer words filled him with icy caution. “What purpose?”\n“To woo the God Emperor. Oh, he knows this. He would not change a thing about me.”\n“Nor would |.”\nShe moved a step closer. He smelled the milky warmth of her breath.\n“They made me too well,” she said. “I was designed to please an Atreides. Leto says his Duncan is more an Atreides than many born to the name.”\n“Leto?”\n“How else should | address the one l'Il wed?”\nEven as she spoke, Hwi leaned toward Idaho. As though a magnet had found its point of critical attraction, they moved together. Hwi pressed her cheek against his tunic, her arms around him feeling the hard muscles. Idaho rested his chin in her hair, the musk filling his senses.\n“This is insane,” he whispered.\n“Yes.”\nHe lifted her chin and kissed her.\nShe pressed herself against him.\nNeither of them doubted where this must lead. She did not resist when he lifted her off her feet and carried her into the bedroom.\nOnly once did Idaho speak. “You’re not a virgin.”\n“Nor are you, Love.”\n“Love,” he whispered. “Love, love, love...”\n“Yes... yes!”\nIn the post-coital peace, Hwi put both hands behind her head and stretched, twisting on the rumpled bed. Idaho sat with his back to her looking out the window.\n“Who were your other lovers?” he asked.\nShe lifted herself on one elbow. “I’ve had no other lovers.’\n“But...” He turned and looked down at her.\n“In my teens,” she said, “there was a young man who needed me very much.” She smiled. “Afterward, | was very ashamed. How trusting | was! | thought | had failed the people who depended on me. But they found out and they were elated. You know, | think | was being tested.”\nIdaho scowled. “Is that how it was with me? | needed you?”\n“No, Duncan.” Her features were grave. “We gave joy to each other because that’s how it is with love.”\n“Love!” he said, and it was a bitter sound.\nShe said: “My Uncle Malky used to say that love was a bad bargain because you get no guarantees.”\n“Your Uncle Malky was a wise man.”\n“He was stupid! Love needs no guarantees.”\nA smile twitched at the corners of Idaho’s mouth.\nShe grinned up at him. “You know it’s love when you want to give joy and damn the consequences.”\nHe nodded. “I think only of the danger to you.”\n“We are what we are,” she said.\n“What will we do?”\n“We'll cherish this for as long as we live.”\n“You sound... So final.”\n“Lam.”\n“But we'll see each other every...”\n“Never again like this.”\nr\n“Hwi!” He hurled himself across the bed and buried his face in her breast.\nShe stroked his hair.\nHis voice muffled against her, he said: “What if I’ve impreg...”\n“Shush! If there’s to be a child, there will be a child.”\nIdaho lifted his head and looked at her. “But he’ll know for Sure!”\n“He'll Know anyway.”\n“You think he really knows everything?”\n“Not everything, but he’ll know this.”\n“How?”\n“I will tell him.”\nIdaho pushed himself away from her and sat up on the bed. Anger warred with confusion in his expression.\n“I must,” she said.\n“If he turns against you. . . Hwi, there are stories. You could be in terrible danger!”\n“No. | have needs, too. He knows this. He will not harm either of us.”\n“Buthe...”\n“He will not destroy me. He will know that if he harms you that would destroy me.”\n“How can you marry him?”\n“Dear Duncan, have you not seen that he needs me more than you do?”\n“But he cannot... | mean, you can’t possibly .. .”\n“The joy that you and | have in each other, l'Il not have that with Leto. It’s impossible for him. He has confessed this to me.”\n“Then why can’t... If he loves you...”\n“He has larger plans and larger needs.” She reached out and took Idaho’s right hand in both of hers. “I’ve known that since | first began to study about him. Needs larger than either of us have.”\n“What plans? What needs?”\n“Ask him.”\n“Do you know?”\n“Yes.”\n“You mean you believe those stories about...”\n“There is honesty and goodness in him. | know it by my own responses to him. What my Ixian masters made in me was, | think, a reagent which reveals more than they wanted me to know.”\n“Then you believe him!” Idaho accused. He tried to pull his hand away from her.\n“If you go to him, Duncan, and...”\n“He'll never see me again!”\n“He will.” She pulled his hand to her mouth and kissed his fingers. “I’m a hostage,” he said. “You’ve made me fearful... the\ntwo of you together...” “I never thought it would be easy to serve God,” she said. “Į just didn’t think it would be this hard.”\nMemory has a curious meaning to me, a meaning | have hoped others might share. It continually astonished me how people hide from their ancestral memories, shielding themselves behind a thick barrier of mythos. Ohhh, | do not expect them to seek the terrible immediacy of every living moment which | must experience. | can understand that they might not want to be submerged in a mush of petty ancestral details. You have reason to fear that your living moments might be taken over by others. Yet, the meaning is there within those memories. We carry all of our ancestry forward like a living wave, all of the hopes and joys and griefs, the agonies and the exultations of our past. Nothing within those memories remains completely without meaning or influence, not as long as there is a humankind somewhere. We have that bright Infinity all around us, that Golden Path of forever to which we can continually pledge our puny but inspired allegiance.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\n44 | have summoned you, Moneo, because of what my guards tell me,” Leto said.\nThey stood in the darkness of the crypt where, Moneo reminded himself, some of the God Emperor’s most painful decisions originated. Moneo, too, had heard reports. He had been expecting the summons all afternoon and, when it came shortly after the evening meal, a moment of terror had engulfed him.\n“Is it about... about the Duncan, Lord?”\n“Of course it’s about the Duncan!”\n“I’m told, Lord... his behavior...”\n“Terminal behavior, Moneo?”\nMoneo bowed his head. “If you Say it, Lord.”\n“How long until the Tleilaxu could supply us with another one?”\n“They say they have had problems, Lord. It might be as much as two years.”\n“Do you know what my guards tell me, Moneo?”\nMoneo held his breath. If the God Emperor had learned about this latest... No! Even the Fish Speakers were terrified by the affront. Had it been anyone but a Duncan, the women would have taken it upon themselves to eliminate him.\n“Well, Moneo?”\n“lam told, Lord, that he called out a levy of guards and questioned them about their origins. On what worlds were they born? What of their parentage, their childhood?”\n“And the answers did not please him.”\n“He frightened them, Lord. He kept insisting.”\n“As though repetition could elicit the truth, yes.”\nMoneo allowed himself to hope that this might be the whole of his Lord’s concern. “Why do the Duncans always do this, Lord?”\n“It was their early training, the Atreides training.”\n“But how did that differ from. . .”\n“The Atreides lived in the service of the people they governed. The measure of their government was found in the lives of the governed. Thus, the Duncans always want to know how the people live.”\n“He has spent a night in one village, Lord. He has been to some of the towns. He has seen...”\n“It’s all in how you interpret the results, Moneo. Evidence is nothing without judgments.”\n“| have observed that he judges, Lord.”\n“We all do, but the Duncans tend to believe that this universe is hostage to my will. And they know that you cannot do wrong in the name of right.”\n“Is that what he says you...”\n“It is what / say, what all of the Atreides in me say. This universe will not permit it. The things you attempt will not endure if you...”\n“But, Lord! You do no wrong!”\n“Poor Moneo. You cannot see that | have created a vehicle of injustice.”\nMoneo could not speak. He realized that he had been diverted by a seeming return to mildness in the God Emperor. But now, Moneo sensed changes moving in that great body, and at this proximity ... Moneo glanced around the crypt’s central chamber, reminding himself of the many deaths which had occurred here and which were enshrined here.\nIs it my time?\nLeto spoke in a musing tone. “You cannot succeed by taking hostages. That is a form of enslavement. One kind of human cannot own another kind of human. This universe will not permit it.”\nThe words lay there, simmering in Moneo’s awareness, a terrifying contrast to the rumblings of transformation which he sensed in his Lord.\nThe Worm comes!\nAgain, Moneo glanced around the crypt chamber. This place was far worse than the aerie! Sanctuary was too remote.\n“Well, Moneo, do you have any response?” Leto asked.\nMoneo ventured a whisper: “The Lord’s words enlighten me.”\n"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_9a36878f2820d17c95675c3c41598b002dc6e8cb52c0c385f95f70bb92aca72e_v2"}
