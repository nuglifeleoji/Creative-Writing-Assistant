\n　　金俊武夫妇赶忙敬让着叫前地主的大儿子吃饭。 \n　　但金光亮笑着摇摇头，说他吃过了。他抿了一口自己的蜂蜜水，香得张开嘴“哈”地一声，眯住眼陶醉地说：“好东西啊！再好的饭也比不上这蜂糖。怪不得丸药都用蜂糖做哩，十全大补嘛！过去咱们谁知道外国还有蜂？我这蜂是意大利的！听说光明是走后门才给我买了两箱……”每过几天，金光亮就情不自禁要到这个饭桌前来能一能他的“意大利”蜂。就目前而言，金光亮也许是全双水村最为得意的公民。地主成份的愁帽刚摘不久，二小子就当了中国人民解放军。紧接着，门外工作的大弟弟又给他捎回来两箱子“意大利”蜂。除过冬大，他一年三季动不动就到石圪节或米家镇卖蜂蜜。票子虽不是大把抓，也足让双水村大部分人家眼热。今年以来，他也不再出山劳动，整天和他的蜂为伍。山里的庄稼有他的大锤和三锤耕种。这人轻闲得三天两天就赶集上会，又喝的是蜂蜜水，光景日月绿格铮铮，他不能叫谁能哩？ \n　　金光亮这样得意洋洋地说话的时候，他的“意大利”蜂就在旁边金俊武家的养麦花上嗡嗡嘤嘤地采蜜。并且不时吟唱着从三个人之间穿过，象是进行飞行表演。 \n　　精人金俊武只好对浅薄的金光亮微笑着点头，表示对他和他的“意大利”蜂心怀敬意。但他老婆李玉玲却气得把脸迈向一边，给金光亮个后脑勺。 \n　　在李玉玲的想象中，金光亮的这些“毛老子”在她家的果树和荞麦花上采蜜，很可能把里面最好的养料都采光了，因此对这蜂充满了仇恨。而更使她气愤的是，老东西金光亮还常跑来能他的这群毛老子哩！ \n　　李玉玲曾几次给丈夫建议，在自家的果树上喷些“六六六”，把这该死的“意大利”蜂都毒死，让老地主的儿子再能！但金俊武坚决地阻挡了她这危险想法。俊武虽然个性强，可他从来不做这种短事。采就采去吧，能就能去吧，这金光亮几十年抬不起头，快六十岁的人了，也让他张狂上几天……金光亮这时又抿一口蜂蜜水，正准备继续夸耀他的意大利蜂，却突然象蜂在屁股上蛰了一下，一闪身站起来，慌乱地说：“看我这忘性！\n######################\nOutput:",
