忽然伏兵四起，孙策当先出马，高声大叫曰：“孙郎在此！”众军皆惊，尽弃枪习，拜于地下。策令休杀一人。张英拨马回走，被陈武一枪刺死。陈横被蒋钦一箭射死。薛礼死于乱军中。策入秣陵，安辑居民；移兵至泾县来捉太史慈。\n\n    却说太史慈招得精壮二千余人，并所部兵，正要来与刘繇报仇。孙策与周瑜商议活捉太史慈之计。瑜令三面攻县，只留东门放走；离城二十五里，三路各伏一军，太史慈到那里，人困马乏，必然被擒。原来太史慈所招军大半是山野之民，不谙纪律。泾县城头，苦不甚高。当夜孙策命陈武短衣持刀，首先爬上城放火。太史慈见城上火起，上马投东门走，背后孙策引军赶来。太史慈正走，后军赶至三十里，却不赶了。太史慈走了五十里，人困马乏，芦苇之中，喊声忽起。慈急待走，两下里绊马索齐来，将马绊翻了，生擒太史慈，解投大寨。策知解到太史慈，亲自出营喝散士卒，自释其缚，将自己锦袍衣之，请入寨中，谓曰：“我知子义真丈夫也。刘繇蠢辈，不能用为大将，以致此败。”慈见策待之甚厚，遂请降。\n\n    策执慈手笑曰：“神亭相战之时，若公获我，还相害否？”慈笑曰：“未可知也。”策大笑，请入帐，邀之上坐，设宴款待。慈曰：“刘君新破，士卒离心。某欲自往收拾余众，以助明公。不识能相信否？”策起谢曰：“此诚策所愿也。今与公约：明日日中，望公来还。”慈应诺而去。诸终曰：“太史慈此去必不来矣。”策曰：“子义乃信义之士，必不背我。”众皆未信。次日，立竿于营门以候日影。恰将日中，太史慈引一千余众到寨。孙策大喜。众皆服策之知人。于是孙策聚数万之众，下江东，安民恤众，投者无数。江东之民，皆呼策为“孙郎”。但闻孙郎兵至，皆丧胆而走。及策军到，并不许一人掳掠，鸡犬不惊，人民皆悦，赍牛酒到寨劳军。策以金帛答之，欢声遍野。其刘繇旧军，愿从军者听从，不愿为军者给赏归农。江南之民，无不仰颂。由是兵势大盛。策乃迎母叔诸弟俱归曲阿，使弟孙权与周泰守宣城。策领兵南取吴郡。\n\n
