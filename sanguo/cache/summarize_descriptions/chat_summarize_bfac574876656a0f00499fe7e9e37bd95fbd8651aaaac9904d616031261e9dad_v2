Renowned for his bravery, military prowess, and strategic acumen, he played a crucial role in various military campaigns, particularly against the Wei state and the southern barbarians. His fierce loyalty to the Shu cause and to his superior, Zhuge Liang (孔明), was a defining characteristic of his military career.\n\nWei Yan was often tasked with leading troops in significant battles, including those against the Mán people and during the defense of strategic positions. He was recognized for his aggressive tactics and combat skills, particularly in ambushes and rear guard actions. His leadership was instrumental in the defense of An Ding and in the confrontations against Meng Huo, where he demonstrated his capability to rally troops and execute complex battle strategies.\n\nDespite his many successes, Wei Yan's ambition and boldness sometimes led to tensions within the Shu hierarchy. He was involved in critical military decisions and proposed strategies to outmaneuver the enemy, showcasing his strategic mind. However, his eagerness to engage in battle occasionally put him at odds with his superiors, leading to moments of disobedience and conflict. Notably, he faced accusations of treachery against Yang Yi and was later executed under the orders of Zhuge Liang, which marked a tragic end to his career.\n\nWei Yan's military exploits included significant engagements, such as the battle against Zhang He, where he displayed remarkable valor but ultimately faced defeat. He was also involved in the defense strategies that captured enemy generals, demonstrating his tactical effectiveness. His contributions to the Shu army were vital, as he often took on dangerous missions and led troops during critical moments, including the defense against enemy forces where he was rescued by Zhao Yun.\n\nIn summary, Wei Yan was a complex figure in the Shu Han military, celebrated for his bravery and combat skills, yet marked by ambition that sometimes led to conflict with his peers. His legacy is one of a fierce warrior who played a pivotal role in the defense and military strategies of the Shu kingdom, ultimately becoming a symbol of both loyalty and tragic downfall in the annals of Chinese history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "protected_material_text": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "low"}}}], "created": 1754898716, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 439, "prompt_tokens": 1311, "total_tokens": 1750, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
