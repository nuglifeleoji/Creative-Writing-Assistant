\n　　当少平引着晓霞，下了师傅家外面的小土坡，走到铁路上的时候，已经是夜里十点多了。再过一个多小时，他就要带着她下井。他的心情不免有点紧张。晓霞第一次到一个危险的地方，他生怕出个差错。好在王世才也知道了晓霞要下井，说他一会亲自领着他们去。 \n　　现在，他们在黑暗中踏着铁轨的枕木，肩并肩相跟着向矿部那里走去。远处，灯火组成了一个斓漫的世界。夜晚的矿区看起来无比的壮丽。晓霞挽着他的胳膊，依偎着他，激动地望着这个陌生的天地。初夏温暖的夜风轻轻吹拂着这对幸福的青年。在黑户区的某个地方传来轻柔的小提琴声，旋律竟是《如歌的行板》。这里呀！并不是想象中的一片荒凉和粗莽；在这远离都市的黑色世界里，到处漫流着生活的温馨…… \n　　晓霞依偎着他，嘴里不由轻声哼起了《格兰特船长和他的孩子们》中的那支插曲。少平雄浑的男中音加入了进来，使那浪花飞溅的溪流变成了波涛起伏的大河。唱吧，多好的夜晚；即便没有月亮，心中也是一片皎洁！ \n　　当他们忘情地在铁路上走出一段后，猛然在旁边的山崖下蹿出一条黑影，径直堵在了他们面前。 \n　　他们不由紧张地站住了。少平从轮廓上看出，这是他师兄安锁子！ \n　　这头变态的公牛要干什么？他是否发了疯？ \n　　少平不由捏紧了双拳。 \n　　“你们吃过饭了？”黑暗中果真是安锁子在说话。“我听说你的……女人来了。又听说你们到师傅家去吃饭。我划算吃完饭天黑看不见路。就……” \n　　“那你怎么不上师傅家来？”少平没有明白安锁子说的是什么意思。 \n　　“我……没好意思。”安锁子嗫嚅说。“我是专门拿手电给你们照路的，怕天黑，你们有个闪失……” \n　　天啊，原来是这样！少平真想为他的“雷锋精神”而扇他一记耳光！ \n　　“走吧，我在前面给你们照路……”安锁子殷勤地说。 \n　　他说着便调转身，捏亮了手电——他们眼前即刻出现了一道多余的光亮。 \n　　少平一时反应不过来他该怎么办。这家伙！竟然干这种令人哭笑不得的事！ \n　　不过，他感觉，这令人厌恶的举动似乎还不包含恶意。 \n　　他只好和晓霞在安锁子照出的道路上继续往前走。他给晓霞介绍说：“这是我们一个班的工人，叫安锁子。” \n　　晓霞并不知道这是怎样一个人，听说这人和她的少平一块干活，赶忙走前一步，要和安锁子握手，安锁子\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
