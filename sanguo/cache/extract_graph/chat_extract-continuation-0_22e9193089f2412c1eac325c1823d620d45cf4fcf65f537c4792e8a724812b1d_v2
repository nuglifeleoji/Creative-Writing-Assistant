饥馑并臻，天灾人困：无问智愚，皆知土崩瓦解，此乃天灭袁氏之时也。今明公提兵攻邺，袁尚不还救，则失巢穴；若还救，则谭踵袭其后。以明公之威，击疲惫之众，如迅风之扫秋叶也。不此之图，而伐荆州；荆州丰乐之地，国和民顺，未可摇动。况四方之患，莫大于河北；河北既平，则霸业成矣。愿明公详之。”操大喜曰：“恨与辛佐治相见之晚也！”即日督军还取冀州。玄德恐操有谋，不跟追袭，引兵自回荆州。\n\n    却说袁尚知曹军渡河，急急引军还邺，命吕旷、吕翔断后。袁谭见尚退军，乃大起平原军马，随后赶来。行不到数十里，一声炮响，两军齐出：左边吕旷，右边吕翔，兄弟二人截住袁潭。谭勒马告二将曰：“吾父在日，吾并未慢待二将军，今何从吾弟而见逼耶？”二将闻言，乃下马降谭。谭曰：“勿降我，可降曹承相。”二将因随谭归营。谭候操军至，引二将见操。操大喜，以女许谭为妻，即令吕旷、吕翔为媒。谭请操攻取冀州。操曰：“方今粮草不接，搬运劳苦，我济河，遏淇水入白沟，以通粮道，然后进兵。”令谭且居平原。操引军退屯黎阳，封吕旷、吕翔为列侯，随军听用。\n\n    郭图谓袁谭曰：“曹操以女许婚，恐非真意。今又封赏吕旷、吕翔，带去军中，此乃牢笼河北人心。后必终为我祸。主公可刻将军印二颗，暗使人送与二吕，令作内应。待操破了袁尚，可乘便图之。”谭依言，遂刻将军印二颗，暗送与二吕。二吕受讫，径将印来禀曹操。操大笑曰：“谭暗送印者，欲汝等为内助，待我破袁尚之后，就中取事耳。汝等且权受之，我自有主张。”自此曹操便有杀谭之心。\n\n    且说袁尚与审配商议：“今曹兵运粮入白沟，必来攻冀州，如之奈何？”配曰：“可发檄使武安长尹楷屯毛城，通上党运粮道；令沮授之子沮鹄守邯郸，遥为声援。主公可进兵平原，急攻袁谭。先绝袁谭，然后破曹。”袁尚大喜，留审配与陈琳守冀州，使马延、张顗二将为先锋，连夜起兵攻打平原。\n\n    谭知尚兵来近，告急于操。操曰：“吾今番必得冀州矣。”正说间，适许攸自许昌来；闻尚又攻谭，入见操曰：“丞相坐守于此，岂欲待天雷击杀二袁乎？”操笑曰：“吾已料定矣。”�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
