\n　　她把这信递到他面前，说：“这是……给你的信。”信？谁给他来的信？家里？惠英嫂？ \n　　他刚把信接过来，金秀就背转身走了。 \n　　信皮上无一字。封口也没封。 \n　　孙少平立刻抽出信纸。他只看见“哥，我爱你……”几个字，就闭住眼发出一声呻吟般的叹息…… \n                  第53章\n　　一九八五年清明节前后，尽管山野仍然是一望无际的荒凉，但双水村却随处可见盎然的春意了。东拉河和哭咽河两岸的柳树，绿色柔嫩的枝条已经在春风中摇曳摆动。无论是田家圪崂，还是金家湾，一团雪白的杏花或一树火红的桃花，从这家那家的墙头伸出来，使得这个主要以破窑烂院组成的村庄，平添了许多繁荣景象。 \n　　灿烂的阳光一扫冬日的阴霾，天空顿时湛蓝如洗。山川河流早已解冻，泥土中散发出草芽萌发的新鲜气息。黄土高原两类主要的候鸟中，燕子已经先一步从南方赶来，正双双对对在老地方筑新巢；而大雁的队列约摸在十天之后就掠过高原的上空，向鄂尔多斯边的北草地飞去……农事繁忙起来了。神仙山，庙坪山和田家圪崂这面的山山洼洼上，不时传来庄稼人唱歌一般的吆牛声。女人们头上罩起雪白的羊肚子毛巾，孩子们手里端着升子老碗，跟在犁犋后面点籽撒粪。西葫芦、南瓜、黑豆、绿黑豆、小日月玉米、西红柿、夏洋芋、夏回子白、西瓜、黄瓜，都到了播种的时节。麻子已经出苗；水葱，韭菜可以动镰割头茬。所有的麦苗都已经返青，庄稼人正忙着锄草追化肥……但是，一九八五年的春天，双水村的庄稼人不象往常那样特别留意大自然的变化。人们怀着各式各样的心情，集中关注着哭咽河那里正在进行的事件。从去年秋末冬初开始，孙少安个人掏腰包出资一万五千元重建的双水村小学，现在眼看就要最后峻工了。现在，田福堂当年拦河打坝震坏的校舍窑洞，已经被一排气势宏伟的新窑洞所替代。当年的学校操场也扩大了一倍，栽起一副标准的篮球架，还有一些其他庄稼人叫不出名堂的玩艺儿。操场四周砌起了围墙。铁栏式大门上面，拱形铁架上“双水村小学”五个铁字，被红油刷得耀眼夺目。据说一两天内就要举行“落成典礼”，到时乡上县上的领导都来参加；听说黄原还要来人拍电视哩。哈呀，孙少安小子虽然破了财，\n######################\nOutput:",
