Lady Jessica, a Reverend Mother among the Fremen, is a powerful figure trained in the mystical and political arts of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. She has diligently passed on this knowledge to her son, Paul, who inherits her abilities and legacy. Following the fall of House Atreides, the two are forced into hiding together, relying on their combined skills and resilience to survive. Their relationship is central to their identities, as Jessica serves as both Paul’s mother and mentor, while Paul embodies the culmination of her teachings and the Bene Gesserit’s long-laid plans.
