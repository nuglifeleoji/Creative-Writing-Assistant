制，农民的日子比往年好了，可新政策才刚刚一年，凭什么能打下万斤粮食或赚下五千元钱呢？这不是逼着让他徐治功去上吊吗？哼，别说农民，他徐治功也没那么多家当！ \n　　可是，找不出“冒尖户”，徐治功没办法给县上交待，再说，没个“冒尖户”，他又有什么脸向去参加“四干”会？ \n　　找不出来也得找！找不出来就说明他徐治功没把工作做好！ \n　　他们副手刘根民叫来，发愁地和他商量到哪里去找个“冒尖户”。 \n　　两个人扳着手指头一个村子一个村子往过数，结果还是找不出来一个。 \n　　徐治功突然手在大腿上拍一巴掌，说：“我好象听说双水村的金富弄了不少钱，兴许这个子能够上标准哩！”刘根民淡淡一笑，对兴奋的徐主任说：“据有人传说，他的钱不是从正路上得来的去他妈的！不管是偷的还是抢的，只要凑够五千块就行了！” \n　　“这样恐怕不行。”刘根民摇摇头，再说，如果这小子真是用不正当手段弄来的钱，他也不会给你说他有那么多。” \n　　“那咱们怎么办？”徐治功束手无策地问刘根民。刘根民能有什么办法呢？ \n　　徐治功背抄着手在地上走了两圈，又来了“灵感”，说：“你的同学孙少安怎么样？这小子开了烧砖窑，说不定赚下不少钱呢！” \n　　“据我所知，少安也没赚下那么多钱。”刘根民说。“不管怎样，咱们一块到双水村去看看！” \n　　刘根民也和徐治功一样急，找不出个“冒尖户”，县上不会饶了石圪节公社。 \n　　刘根民只好和徐治功一人骑了一辆自行车，到双水村找孙少安，看能不能把他的同学凑合成个“冒尖户”。 \n　　公社的两位领导在烧砖窑的土场上找到了满脸烟灰的孙少安。 \n　　少安听他们说明来意后，惊讶地说：“哎呀，你们也不想想，我就这么个摊场，怎么可能赚下那么多钱呢？”“你甭轻看这事！”徐治功诱导说：“当了‘冒尖户’，不光到县上披红挂花扬一回名，还给奖一台缝纫机呢！”“我没资格去光荣嘛！”少安无可奈何地说，“把我的骨头卖了，也凑不够那么多钱。” \n　　“嗨，这就看怎样算帐哩！”徐治功嘴一撇，给刘根民挤了一下眼睛，“咱们回家去说吧！” \n　　少安引着他们回到家里。徐治功一进院子，就指着少安的三孔新窑洞说：“这不是个‘冒尖户’是个啥？”秀莲一看两个公社领导上了门赶忙洗手做饭。 \n　　徐治功立刻发明了一种“新式”算帐法。他把孙少安的现金、粮食、窑洞和家里的东西统统折了价，打在一起估算。后来又加上了现存的砖、砖坯和�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
