\n　　大年三十那天，兰花默默地作好了四个人的年饭，然后怀着最后一线希望，手拉着两个可怜的孩子从家里出来，立在公路边上，等待从黄原开过来的班车。 \n　　村中已经响起了一片爆竹声，到处都飘散着年茶饭的香味；所有的孩子们都穿上了新衣服，嗷嗷喊叫着沉浸在节日的欢乐中。 \n　　清冷的寒风中，兰花母子三人相偎着站在公路边上，焦灼地向远方张望。 \n　　黄原的班车终于开过来了！ \n　　但车没有在罐子村停，刮风一般向米家镇方向开了过去，车里面看来没坐几个人——除非万不得已，谁愿意大年三十才回家呢？ \n　　汽车走了，只留下一条空荡荡的路和路边上三个孤零零的人。 \n　　猫蛋和狗蛋几乎一齐“哇”地哭出了声。兰花尽管被生活操磨得有点麻木，但此刻也忍不住伤心，泪水在那张饱经忧患的脸上淌着。她只好哄儿女说：“甭哭了，咱们到你外爷爷家去过年…… \n　　兰花拉着两个孩子回到家里，把做好的年茶饭用笼布一包，然后锁住门，母子三人就去了双水村……兰花和孩子门怎能想到，大年三十那天，王满银还踯躅在省城火车站的候车室里。他身上的钱只够吃几碗面条，甭说回家，连到黄原的一张汽车票都买不起。 \n　　这位生意人通常作不起大买卖。因为没有本钱，他一般只倒贩一点猪毛猪鬃或几张羊皮，赚两个钱，自己混个嘴油肚圆就心满意足了。在很多情况下，他象一个流浪汉，往返流落在省城和黄原之间的交通上；这条线上的大小城镇都不止一次留下了这个二流子的足迹。他也认识不少类似他这样的狐朋狗友；有时候嘴巴免不了要吊起来，就在这些同类中混着吃喝点什么。当然，他也得随时准备款待嘴巴吊起来的朋友。他从没想到过要改变他的这种生活方式。浪荡的品质似乎都渗进了他的血液。有时候，他记起自己还有老婆孩子，心里忍不住毛乱一阵。但二两劣等烧酒下肚，一切就又会忘得一干二净，继续无忧无虑地往返于省城和黄原的大小城镇，做他的无本生意。 \n　　入冬以后，生意更难做了。政策一活，大量的农民利用农闲时节，纷纷做起了各种小买卖，使得象王满银这样的专业生意人陷入困境之中。 \n　　眼看走投无路，身上的几个钱也快吃光的时候，他突然听说上海的木耳价钱很贵，一斤能卖二十多元。这“信息”使王满银萌发了到上海贩卖一回\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
