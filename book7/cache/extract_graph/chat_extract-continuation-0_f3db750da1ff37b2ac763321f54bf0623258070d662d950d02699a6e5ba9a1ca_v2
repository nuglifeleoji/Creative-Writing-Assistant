“不过，如果容许我辩解的话，正因为发生了这种事让我身心俱疲，才会见你想稍微得到一点慰藉吧。”他抓抓偷，皱起鼻子。\n    靖子依然说不出话。她回想起自己离职时的情景，在酒廊上班的最后一天，工藤还带了一束花来送她。\n    你要好好加油幸福生活噢――\n    当时他是抱着什么心情说出那样的话呢？他自己明明背负了更大的苦难，但他只字未提，反而祝福靖子重新出发。\n    “话题好像被我越说越闷了。”工藤为了掩饰腼腆取出香烟，“简而言之，我想说的是经过这件事后，我的家庭已经没什么可担心的了。”\n    “啊，可是令郎呢？不是快要考大学了吗？”\n    “我儿子现在住在我爸妈家。那里离他的高中比较近，况且，我连替他煮顿宵夜也不会。我妈忙着照顾孙子好像挺乐的。”\n    “那么你现在其实是一个人生活？”\n    “说是生活，其实回家只是为了睡觉。”\n    “上次你怎么完全没提这件事？”\n    “我觉得没必要说，我是担心你才去见你的。不过像这样找你出来吃饭，你一定会顾忌我的家庭，所以我想还是先说清楚比较好。”\n    “原来是这样……”靖子垂下眼。\n    她早就明白工藤的真意。他在暗示自己，他希望正式和她交往，而且说不定是想以结婚为前提而交往。他想见美里，似乎也是为了这个理由。\n    出了餐厅，工藤像上次一样叫计程车送她回公寓。\n    “今天谢谢你请客。”靖子下车前向他郑重道谢。\n    “改天可以再约你吗？”\n    靖子沉默了一下，才微笑说好。\n    “那么晚安，代我向你女儿问好。”\n    “晚安。”靖子嘴上这么回答，心里却觉得今晚的事难以对美里启齿。因为她在答录机里，说要跟小代子他们去吃饭。\n    目送工藤坐的计程车远去后，靖子回到家里。美里正窝在暖桌里看电视，桌上果然放着披萨的空纸盒。\n    “你回来了。”美里仰脸看着靖子。\n    “我回来了，今天真对不起。”\n    靖子怎么也无法正视女儿的脸。对于和男人出去吃饭一事，她感到有点心虚。\n    “电话打过来了吗？”美里问。\n    “电话？”\n    “我是说隔壁的……石神先生。”美里越说越小声，好像是指每天的按时联络。\n    “我把手机关掉了。”\n    “恩……”美里一脸闷闷不乐。\n    “出了什么事吗？”\n    “那倒没有，”美里瞥了一眼墙上时钟，“石神先生今晚从家里进进出出好几次。我从窗口看到他好像是往马路走，我猜应该是打电话给你吧。”\n    “喔……”\n    也许吧，靖子想。其实和工藤吃饭的时�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
