As a self-proclaimed prophet and shaman, 刘玉升 claims to have visited the underworld and interacted with spirits, which has earned him a reputation as a mystical figure and healer among the villagers.\n\nHis influence extends to various aspects of village life, particularly in spiritual and community activities. 刘玉升 is a key figure in the planning and reconstruction of a temple, leading the \"\"建庙会\"\" (Temple Building Association) and competing with the \"\"建校会\"\" (School Building Association) for community support. He plays a significant role in worship practices at the broken temple and is involved in rituals that include food offerings, providing guidance to villagers on these spiritual matters.\n\nIn addition to his leadership in temple activities, 刘玉升 is known for his healing abilities, treating illnesses and providing assistance to individuals like 孙玉厚 and his wife. His reputation as a folk healer has made him a sought-after figure in the surrounding villages, where he has gained financial stability through his practices, including palm reading and fortune-telling.\n\nHowever, 刘玉升's influence is not without controversy.
