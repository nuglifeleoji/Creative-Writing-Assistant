哪怕一家子都是魂师，回到熟悉的家中，南澄和蓝潇还是一下瘫软在床上，一动都不想动。长途宇宙旅行，还真的是疲惫啊！\n\n    蓝轩宇也有些疲惫了，但他还记得娜娜对他说过的话，没有直接睡觉，而是在自己的小房间中，盘膝进入到冥想状态。\n\n    物我两忘，就在他完全进入冥想后不久，他的精神空间内再次亮了起来。\n------------\n\n第三十七章 家庭老师\n\n    “娜娜老师。”蓝轩宇惊喜的看着眼前的娜娜，叫了起来，“老师你说话算数真好。”\n\n    娜娜微微一笑，摸了摸他的头，“老师当然会说话算数哦。而且，很快就到了你兑现承诺的时候了。你可欠我亲很多次呢。”\n\n    蓝轩宇抗声道：“你也欠我的。”\n\n    娜娜笑道：“好，那我们回头互相还债。来吧，继续我们的游戏。来抓我吧。”\n\n    “哈哈，我现在就抓着你呢。算我先赢一次。”蓝轩宇抱住她，一脸的坏笑。\n\n    “好吧。算你先赢一次。那重新来。”娜娜不以为意，只是笑笑。\n\n    蓝轩宇松开手，然后立刻又抱了上去，嘴里喊着，“第二次。”\n\n    他记得很清楚，娜娜跟他说过，出其不意是闪避最重要的。\n\n    可惜，他面对的终究是自己的老师，一步跨出，吸胸收腹，几乎是在间不容发之际，娜娜避开了他这一抱。而接下来的过程，蓝轩宇自然是不可能再次抓住她了。\n\n    一直到疲惫的不行，游戏才随之停止，蓝轩宇又继续陷入自己的冥想之中。\n\n    银色光芒流转，紫萝城一条阴暗的小巷中，带着口罩的娜娜缓缓走了出来。身上的银色光晕随之收敛，信步走在街道上。\n\n    她也不知道自己应该去什么地方，也没有住处。而且，事实上，她也并不像蓝潇认为的那么有钱。\n\n    天斗星科学研究所给她的补助并不多，只是她平时不怎么花钱罢了。\n\n    她就在距离蓝轩宇家不远的地方，事实上，他们真的是乘坐同一艘飞船归来。只不过，娜娜没有买票而已。她现在越来越发现自己的与众不同了。记忆没有恢复，可其他的一些东西，譬如能力，似乎随着她意识的渴望正在逐渐的恢复之中。\n\n    夜晚的街道有些清冷，她就那么向前走着，在路灯的照耀下，拉拽出一条长长的身影。\n\n    清晨。\n\n    蓝轩宇伸了个大大的懒腰，舒展了一下足足坐了一夜的身体。本来以他这个年龄，冥想是很难进行一整夜的，一般都是到一定时间，自然醒转就睡\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
