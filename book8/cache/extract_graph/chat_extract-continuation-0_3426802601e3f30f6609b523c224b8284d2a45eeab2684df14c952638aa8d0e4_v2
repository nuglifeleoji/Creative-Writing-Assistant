就在这时，一股巨大的压力突然从身前传来，他下意识地想要惊呼，却只觉得自己被那强大的力量死死地按在椅背上，而且根本发不出半点声音，仿佛整个人都要被压成碎片似的。\n\n    体内魂力自行运转，可在这种情况下，魂力运转的速度明显降低了。\n\n    幸好，血脉中不断传来热气，从胸口向全身蔓延，这才让蓝轩宇好受了一些。\n\n    突然，蓝轩宇感到身体一轻，压力减弱了一些。\n\n    这就是宇宙吗？蓝轩宇向周围看看，这所谓的星际战机似乎是透明的，让他能够看到四面八方。\n\n    宇宙浩瀚，一望无际。他虽然乘坐过宇宙飞船，但这样几乎是沉浸在宇宙之中还是第一次。这种感觉实在是太美妙了。\n\n    蓝轩宇的兴奋感飞速提升，整个人都变得亢奋起来，就连身体的不适都因此而减轻了几分。\n\n    强劲的压力再次传来，蓝轩宇赶忙向前方看去，就在前方不远处，似乎有什么东西在不断放大。\n\n    星际战机的飞行速度似乎非常快，没过多久，一块块硕大的陨石就出现在了视野之中。\n\n    陨石带？这好像是很危险的地方吧。\n\n    蓝轩宇虽然明知道自己现在是在模拟舱之中，但还是不自觉地紧张起“小子，坐好了，看清楚了。”银天凡的声音响起。\n\n    “进入战场。”提示音响起。战场？没等蓝轩宇明白过来，他就感觉到战机突然向右侧偏转，然后猛然加速，一头扎入陨石带之中。\n\n    战机进入陨石带的速度特别快。周围一块块或大或小的陨石飞速从战机两侧掠过。\n\n    突然，蓝轩宇发现战机前端猛地一亮，只见一道光束从战机前端射出，然后战机就翻滚了起来。\n\n    天旋地转，这就是此时蓝轩宇的感觉。\n\n    关键是，在这天旋地转之中，还有瞬间出现的强劲压力。他整个人都晕头转向起来。\n\n    他隐约听到一阵阵轰鸣声。接着，就一直是天旋地转，周围不断响起轰鸣声，还有无数光影闪烁。可是，他根本没法辨别清楚。\n\n    二十分钟后。模拟舱舱盖缓缓开启。\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百一十一章 都吃了……\n\n    蓝轩宇几乎是逃也似的从模拟舱中跳出来，银天凡的声音传来：“卫生间在那边。”\n\n    蓝轩宇迅速冲入卫生间，然后里面就传来一阵呕吐声……\n\n    “哈哈哈哈！”银天凡笑得很阴险，但丝毫没有因为蓝轩宇的反应而不满，他掰了掰手指头，“当年老夫第一次体验星际战机的时候，好像是坚持了十八分钟，他坚持了十九分钟。\n\n
