Another possibility remained, however—one which would cement the desired characteristic into an offspring. Paul dared offer animal breeding to the Bene Gesserit! How much was he really prepared to pay for his Chani’s life? Would he accept a cross with his own sister?\nSparring for time, the Reverend Mother said: “Tell me, oh flawless exemplar of all that’s holy, has Irulan anything to say of your proposal?”\n“Irulan will do what you tell her to do,” Paul growled.\nTrue enough, Mohiam thought. She firmed her jaw, offered a new gambit: “There are two Atreides.”\nPaul, sensing something of what lay in the old witch’s mind, felt blood darken his face. “Careful what you suggest,” he said.\n“You'd just use Irulan to gain your own ends, eh?” she asked.\n“Wasn't she trained to be used?” Paul asked.\nAnd we trained her, that’s what he’s saying, Mohiam thought. Well... /rulan’s a divided coin. Was there another way to spend such a coin?\n“Will you put Chani’s child on the throne?” the Reverend Mother asked.\n“On my throne,” Paul said. He glanced at Alia, wondering suddenly if she knew the divergent possibilities in this exchange. Alia stood with eyes closed, an odd stillness-of- person about her. With what inner force did she commune? Seeing his sister thus, Paul felt he’d been cast adrift. Alia stood on a shore that was receding from him.\nThe Reverend Mother made her decision, said: “This is too much for one person to decide. | must consult with my Council on Wallach. Will you permit a message?”\nAs though she needed my permission! Paul thought.\nHe said: “Agreed, then. But don’t delay too long. | will not sit idly by while you debate.”\n“Will you bargain with the Bene Tleilax?” the ghola asked, his voice a sharp intrusion.\nAlia’s eyes popped open and she stared at the ghola as though she’d been wakened by a dangerous intruder.\n“I’ve made no such decision,” Paul said. “What | will do is go into the desert as soon as it can be arranged. Our child will be born in sietch.”\n“A wise decision,” Stilgar intoned.\nAlia refused to look at Stilgar. It was a wrong decision. She could feel this in every cell. Paul must know it. Why had he fixed himself upon such a path?\n“Have the Bene Tleilax offered their services?” Alia asked. She saw Mohiam hanging on the answer.\nPaul shook his head. “No.” He glanced at Stilgar. “Stil, arrange for the message to be sent to Wallach.”\n“At once, m’Lord.”\nPaul turned away, waited while Stilgar summoned guards, left with the old witch. He sensed Alia debating whether to confront him with more questions. She turned, instead, to the ghola.\n“Mentat,” she said, “will the Tleilaxu bid for favor with my brother?”\nThe ghola shrugged.\nPaul felt his attention wander. The Tleilaxu? No... not in the way Alia meant. Her question revealed, though, that she had not seen the alternatives here. Well... vision varied from sibyl to sibyl. Why not a variance from brother to sister? Wandering ... wandering ... He came back from each thought with a start to pick up shards of the nearby conversation.\n“...must know what the Tleilaxu.. .”\n“the fullness of data is always...”\n“healthy doubts where...”\nPaul turned, looked at his sister, caught her attention. He knew she would see tears on his face and wonder at them. Let her wonder. Wondering was a kindness now. He glanced at the ghola, seeing only Duncan Idaho despite the metallic eyes. Sorrow and compassion warred in Paul. What might those metal eyes record?\nThere are many degrees of sight and many degrees of blindness, Paul thought. His mind turned to a paraphrase of the passage from the Orange Catholic Bible: What senses do we lack that we cannot see another world all around us?\nWere those metal eyes another sense than sight?\nAlia crossed to her brother, sensing his utter sadness. She touched a tear on his cheek with a Fremen gesture of awe, said: “We must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing.”\n“Before their passing,” Paul whispered. “Tell me, little sister, what is before?”\nI’ve had a bellyful of the god and priest business! You think | don’t see my own mythos? Consult your data once more, Hayt. I’ve insinuated my rites into the most elementary human acts. The people eat in the name of Muad’Dib! They make love in my name, are born in my name—cross the street in my name. A roof beam cannot be raised in the lowliest hovel of far Gangishree without invoking the blessing of Muad’Dib!\n—BOOK OF DIATRIBES FROM THE HAYT CHRONICLE\nae ess risk much leaving your post and coming to me here at this time,” Edric said, glaring through the walls of his tank at the Face Dancer.\n“How weak and narrow is your thinking,” Scytale said. “Who is it who comes to visit you?”\nEdric hesitated, observing the hulk shape, heavy eyelids, blunt face. It was early in the day and Edric’s metabolism had not yet cycled from night repose into full melange consumption.\n“This is not the shape which walked the streets?” Edric asked.\n“One would not look twice at some of the figures | have been today,” Scytale said.\nThe chameleon thinks a change of shape will hide him from anything, Edric thought with rare insight. And he wondered if his presence in the conspiracy truly hid them from all oracular powers. The Emperor's sister, now...\nEdric shook his head, stirring the orange gas of his tank, said: “Why are you here?”\n“The gift must be prodded to swifter action,” Scytale said.\n“That cannot be done.”\n“A way must be found,” Scytale insisted.\n“Why?”\n“Things are not to my liking. The Emperor is trying to split us. Already he has made his bid to the Bene Gesserit.”\n“Oh, that.”\n“That! You must prod the ghola to...”\n“You fashioned him, Tleilaxu,” Edric said. “You know better than to ask this.” He paused, moved closer to the transparent wall of his tank. “Or did you lie to us about this gift?”\n“Lie?”\n“You said the weapon was to be aimed and released, nothing more. Once the ghola was given we could not tamper.”\n“Any ghola can be disturbed,” Scytale said. “You need do nothing more than question him about his original being.”\n“What will this do?”\n“It will stir him to actions which will serve our purposes.” “He is a mentat with powers of logic and reason,” Edric objected. “He may guess what I’m doing . . . or the sister. If\nher attention is focused upon—”\n“Do you hide us from the sibyl or don’t you?” Scytale asked.\n“I’m not afraid of oracles,” Edric said. “I’m concerned with logic, with real spies, with the physical powers of the Imperium, with the control of the spice, with—”\n“One can contemplate the Emperor and his powers comfortably if one remembers that all things are finite,” Scytale said.\nOddly, the Steersman recoiled in agitation, threshing his limbs like some weird newt. Scytale fought a sense of loathing at the sight. The Guild Navigator wore his usual dark leotard bulging at the belt with various containers. Yet... he gave the impression of nakedness when he moved. It was the swimming, reaching movements, Scytale decided, and he was struck once more by the delicate linkages of their conspiracy. They were not a compatible group. That was weakness.\nEdric’s agitation subsided. He stared out at Scytale, vision colored by the orange gas which sustained him. What plot did the Face Dancer hold in reserve to save himself? Edric wondered. The Tleilaxu was not acting in a predictable fashion. Evil omen.\nSomething in the Navigator’s voice and actions told Scytale that the Guildsman feared the sister more than the Emperor. This was an abrupt thought flashed on the screen of awareness. Disturbing. Had they overlooked something important about Alia? Would the ghola be sufficient weapon to destroy both?\n“You know what is said of Alia?” Scytale asked, probing.\n“What do you mean?” Again, the fish-man was agitated.\n“Never have philosophy and culture had such a patroness,” Scytale said. “Pleasure and beauty unite in—”\n“What is enduring about beauty and pleasure?” Edric demanded. “We will destroy both Atreides. Culture! They dispense culture the better to rule. Beauty! They promote the beauty which enslaves. They create a literate ignorance —easiest thing of all. They leave nothing to chance. Chains! Everything they do forges chains, enslaves. But slaves always revolt.”\n“The sister may wed and produce offspring,” Scytale said.\n“Why do you speak of the sister?” Edric asked.\n“The Emperor may choose a mate for her,” Scytale said.\n“Let him choose. Already, it is too late.”\n“Even you cannot invent the next moment,” Scytale warned. “You are not a creator... any more than are the Atreides.” He nodded. “We must not presume too much.”\n“We aren’t the ones to flap our tongues about creation,” Edric protested. “We aren’t the rabble trying to make a messiah out of Muad’Dib. What is this nonsense? Why are you raising such questions?”\n“It’s this planet,” Scytale said. “/t raises questions.”\n“Planets don’t speak!”\n“This one does.”\n“Oh?”\n“It speaks of creation. Sand blowing in the night, that is creation.”\n“Sand blowing...”\n“When you awaken, the first light shows you the new world—all fresh and ready for your tracks.”\nUntracked sand? Edric thought. Creation? He felt knotted with sudden anxiety. The confinement of his tank, the surrounding room, everything closed in upon him, constricted him.\nTracks in sand.\n“You talk like a Fremen,” Edric said.\n“This is a Fremen thought and it’s instructive,” Scytale agreed. “They speak of Muad’Dib’s Jihad as leaving tracks in the universe in the same way that a Fremen tracks new sand. They’ve marked out a trail in men’s lives.”\n“So?”\n“Another night comes,” Scytale said. “Winds blow.”\n“Yes,” Edric said, “the Jihad is finite. Muad’Dib has used his Jihad and—”\n“He didn’t use the Jihad,” Scytale said. “The Jihad used him. | think he would’ve stopped it if he could.”\n“If he could? All he had to do was—”\n“Oh, be still!” Scytale barked. “You can’t stop a mental epidemic. It leaps from person to person across parsecs. It’s overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad’Dib hasn’t the antidote. The thing has roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, involved in political and genetic manipulation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, the Emperor who leads the Fremen and wields immense political and religious power\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Paul's beloved Fremen concubine, whose life is a central concern in the negotiations\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>Paul's wife and a Bene Gesserit, used as a political tool in the power struggles\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MOHIAM<|>PERSON<|>A Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, involved in high-stakes negotiations with Paul\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Paul's sister, a pre-born with prescient abilities, deeply involved in the political and spiritual conflicts\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>A Fremen Naib and loyal follower of Paul, involved in the logistical arrangements\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive and manipulative faction known for genetic engineering, including the creation of gholas\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HAYT<|>PERSON<|>A ghola of Duncan Idaho, a mentat with hidden agendas and a key player in the conspiracy\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDRIC<|>PERSON<|>A Guild Navigator involved in the conspiracy against Paul, reliant on melange for his abilities\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>A Face Dancer and Tleilaxu agent, skilled in shape-shifting and subterfuge\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>WALLACH<|>GEO<|>The location of the Bene Gesserit Council, where critical decisions are made\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH<|>GEO<|>Fremen underground communities where Paul plans to have his child born\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GANGISHREE<|>GEO<|>A distant region where Paul's influence permeates even the lowest social strata\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MUAD'DIB'S JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>A holy war led by Paul, spreading his influence and leaving lasting marks on the universe\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Paul negotiates with the Bene Gesserit, leveraging their influence for his own ends<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CHANI<|>Paul is deeply devoted to Chani and seeks to protect her life<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>IRULAN<|>Paul uses Irulan as a political pawn, acknowledging her Bene Gesserit training<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>ALIA<|>Paul and Alia share a close but strained sibling relationship, bound by prescience and power<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>STILGAR<|>Stilgar is a loyal follower of Paul, executing his commands without question<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>Paul is wary of the Bene Tleilax and their manipulations, but may need their services<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>HAYT<|>Alia interacts with Hayt, probing his motives and testing his loyalty<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>EDRIC<|>SCYTALE<|>Edric and Scytale conspire against Paul, though their alliance is uneasy<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>Scytale is a Tleilaxu agent, advancing their agenda in the conspiracy<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MOHIAM<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Mohiam represents the Bene Gesserit in negotiations with Paul<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD'DIB'S JIHAD<|>PAUL<|>The Jihad is both Paul's tool and his burden, spreading his influence uncontrollably<|>8\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
