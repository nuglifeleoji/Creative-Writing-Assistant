靖子向富坚提出离婚，但他充耳不闻。如果她契而不舍的再三要求，他就会再次动粗。她在苦恼多日后，找了一个客人介绍的律师商量。在那位律师的奔走下，富坚终于勉强在离婚协议书上盖了章。看来他似乎也明白，如果打起官司自己不仅毫无胜算，恐怕还得付出一笔赡养费。\n    但问题并未就此解决。离婚后富坚仍不时出现在靖子母女面前。每次的说辞都一样：他保证今后会洗心革面努力工作，拜托靖子跟他复合。靖子如果躲着他，他就接近美里，还曾在学校外面守候。\n    看到他不惜下跪的模样，明知是演戏，不免心生同情。也许是因为好歹做过夫妻，多少还留有一点情分，靖子忍不住给了他一点钱。这是最大的错误，食髓知味的富坚，从此出现得更频繁。虽然每次都卑躬屈膝，但脸皮似乎也越来越厚。\n    靖子换了酒廊，也搬了家，尽管觉得美里很可怜还是替她办了转学。自从她到锦系町的酒廊上班后，富坚就此消声匿迹。后来他们又再次搬家，在“天亭”工作了快一年。她以为再也不会跟那个瘟神牵扯不清了。\n    她不能给米泽夫妻添麻烦，也不能让美里发觉。无论如何都得靠自己的力量让那个男人不再出现――靖子凝视着墙上的时钟下定决心。\n    到了约定时间，靖子前往家庭餐厅。富坚正坐在窗边的位子吸烟，桌上放着咖啡杯。靖子一边坐下，一边向女服务员点了一杯可可。其他的饮料可以免费续杯，但她不打算久留。\n    “好了，到底是什么事？”\n    他咧嘴一笑，“哎，别这样性急嘛。”\n    “我也是很忙的，有事就快说。”\n    “靖子 ”富坚伸出手好像想碰她放在桌上的手。靖子察觉到这点，连忙缩回手，他的嘴角一撇。“你好像心情不好。”\n    “那当然。你到底有什么事，非要追着我不放。”\n      “你也用不着这样说话吧。别看我这样，我可是认真的。”\n    “你算哪门子认真？”\n    女服务生送来可可。靖子立刻伸手去拿杯子，她想赶快喝完，赶紧离开。\n    “你现在还是独身吧？”富坚讨好的抬眼看她。\n    “这个应该不是重要吧。”\n    “一个女人家要把女儿拉拔长大可不容易喔。今后花的钱会愈来愈多，就算在那种便当店工作，将来也毫无保障。所以，你能不能重新考虑？我已经跟以前不同了”\n    “哪里不同？那我问你，你现在有正常工作吗？”\n    “我会去工作的，我已经找到工作了。”\n    “这\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
