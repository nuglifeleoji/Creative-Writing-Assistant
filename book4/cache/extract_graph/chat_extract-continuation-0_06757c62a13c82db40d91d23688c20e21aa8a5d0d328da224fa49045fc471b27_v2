时候进沟来看热闹，结果被炸起的土埋住了。等众人发现后赶紧往出刨，刨出来就已经不省人事……不一会，抢救室里走出来一位大夫。他摘掉口罩，对守在院子里的田福堂等人说：“人已经死了！” \n　　院子里所有的人都呆住了。 \n　　这时候，突然听见产房那面传来一阵婴儿的啼哭声。孙少安胸口一热，丢下众人撒开腿就跑。 \n　　他来到产房门口，一位女护士正往出走，笑吟吟地对他说：“一切都正常。是个胖小子！” \n　　泪水刹那间就蒙住了少安的眼睛。他猛一下感到，他现在和这世界上所有的人，都处在了平等的地位。他在心里庄严地说：是呀，我有了儿子，我要做父亲了！ \n                  第52章\n　　孙少平在村里教书已经快一年了。在这一年的时光里，小伙子的个头又蹿高了一截，眼看着撵上了他哥。 \n　　这期间他在家里吃饭，不管歪好，总能填饱肚子，因此身子骨明显地壮实起来，成了一位引人注目的漂亮后生；加之他身上透露出来的那种有文化的素质，使他各方面都给人一种很不一般的印象。在农村，这样的后生往往成为年轻姑娘们所暗暗爱慕的对象。 \n　　他家里的光景依旧很不景气。粮食不够吃；钱更是恨不得一分钱掰成两半花。直到眼下，大哥结婚时借下的粮食和钱都没有还完。他哥和他嫂子加上小侄儿虎虎，一家三口仍然在一队的饲养院和一群牛驴为伍。他已经接替大哥，住在自家院子旁边戳开的那个小土洞里。妹妹兰香依然如故，每天晚上过金家湾那边借宿。父亲一年年老了，而祖母更老了；母亲的身体也比前几年差了许多。至于他大姐兰花一家，那光景烂包得仍然连提也不能提……少平感到欣慰的是，他自己终于能进入本村的学校当了教师。眼下对于一个农家子弟来说，这就是一个再好不过的营生。这一年里，他挣的工分和大哥一样多；而且每月那几块钱的补贴，把家里的帐债也偿还了一部分。近二十年来，他都是向家里索取。现在，他终于给家里贡献一点什么了。他感到自己真正成了一个大人。 \n　　在双水村学校，他带初中班的语文和全校各年级的音乐课。学校负责人、大队副书记金俊山的儿子金成带初中班数学。另外两个教师姚淑芳和田润生带小学各年级的课。润生还兼带全校的体育。 \n　　和他一块共事的三位老师各有各的特点。 \n　　金成一副小康人家的自满，穿一身质地很好而裁剪俗气的制服，故意把里面的红线衣从�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
