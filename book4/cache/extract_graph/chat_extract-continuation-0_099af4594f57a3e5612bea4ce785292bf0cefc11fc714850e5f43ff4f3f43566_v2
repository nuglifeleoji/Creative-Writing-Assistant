\n　　润叶无法理解丽丽的这种“矛盾”。不过，她相信她的痛苦是真实的——这是属于一个现代人的痛苦，也许更具有外人难以理会的深刻性。 \n　　润叶一开始就知道，她不是来用一般的传统道理说服她的朋友。她不可能说服丽丽不要再跳这种痛苦的“爱情三人舞”，她也没有这种水平和智慧。实际上，她还是只说了一些毫无用处的开导话，带着对生活的新的迷茫，走出了这个令人窒息的房间…… \n　　田润叶不知是怎样走回自己家门口的。 \n　　她这时才发现，她已经比平时晚回来一个小时了。她匆忙地把钥匙捅进锁眼，打开了房门。 \n　　走进会客厅，她愣住了：桌子上摆着做好的饭菜，上面都用碗扣着，但不见向前的踪影。她很快瞥见桌子上有一张纸条。她一步跨过去，把纸条拿起来，只见上面写着——饭在桌子上，可能凉了，你热一热。别了，亲人！我感谢你给了我幸福。 \n　　润叶象疯了一般撞开卧室的门。她一下子呆立在门口，她看见向前一只手撑着拐杖，立在窗户下，另一只手正费力地把一根麻绳子往穿窗帘环的铁棍上扔——看来他已经费了大半天劲，仍然没有把绳子搭在铁棍上。 \n　　她猛冲过去，一把抱住了他，接着把他按倒在旁边的床上，哭喊着说：“你在干什么！你这个混蛋！”向前脸色苍白，瞪着一双无精打采的眼睛，突然嘴一咧，在妻子的怀抱里哭了。哭了一会，他呻吟着说：“我不愿再连累你了……你不应该和我这样的人一块生活。你应该有一个健康体面的男人。我知道，终有一天，你会受不了这种生活的。我应该早一点解脱你……” \n　　润叶很快明白，向前的确对她和惠良敏感了。于是哭着对他说了惠良和丽丽的事，惊得这个要寻无常的人嘴巴张得象窑口一样大。 \n　　她突然冲动地把他的手放在自己的肚子上，说：“你难道要把我和孩子都扔下吗？” \n　　“啊？有咱们的……儿子了？” \n　　李向前泪流满面，把脸深深地埋进了妻子的怀抱里。 \n                  第28章\n　　黄土高原火热的夏天来临了。荒凉的山野从南到北依次抹上了大片大片的绿色。河流山溪清澈珠澄，水波映照着蓝天白云，反射出太阳金银般灿烂的光辉。 \n　　千山万岭之中，绿意盎然，野花缤纷；庄稼人赤膊裸体，进入了一年一度的繁忙季节。令人醉心的信天游在无边的高原上不断头地飘荡。大\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
