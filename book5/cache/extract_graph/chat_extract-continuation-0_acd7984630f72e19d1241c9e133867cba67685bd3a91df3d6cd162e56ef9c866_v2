�像每次那样感到十分疲惫，这真是一个累人的游戏，但这次他只休息了半个小时便再次登录。进人《三体》后，在漆黑的背景上，出现了一条意想不到的信息：\n   情况紧急，《三体》服务器即将关闭，剩余时间自由登录，《三体》将直接转换至最后场景。\n20．三体、远征\n  \n   寒冷黎明中的大地上空荡荡的一无所有。没有金字塔，没有联合国大厦，巨摆纪念碑也不知去向，只有黑乎乎的戈壁滩延伸到天际，与他第一次进入这个世界时一样。但汪淼很快发现这只是自己的错觉，那戈壁滩上密密麻麻的小石块，竟都是人头！原来大地上站满了人。汪淼站在一个稍高些的小丘上向下看，这密密的人海一望无际，汪淼大致估计了一下数量，仅目力所及的范围就可能有几亿人！他知道，三体世界的所有人可能都聚集在这里了。寂静笼罩着一切，这几亿人造就的寂静有一种令人窒息的诡异，这黎明中的人海正在等待什么。汪淼看看附近，发现所有的人都在仰望着天空。\n   汪淼抬头望去，发现星空发生了不可息议的变化：群星竟然排成了一个严整的正方形阵列！但汪淼很快发现，这一片排成正方形的星星可能只是位于行星同步轨道上，银河系的星海成了后面一个暗淡的背景，这个正方形相对于背景有明显的运行。正方形阵列中，靠晨光一侧的星体亮度最高，发出的银光能在地面上投出人影，向后面亮度逐渐减弱。汪淼数了数，阵列的一边上有三十多颗星体，那么阵列中的星体．总数是一千左右。这显然是由人造物构成的阵列成一个整体在群星的背景上缓缓移动，看上去充满了庄严约力量感。\n   这时，站在旁边的一个男人轻轻推了推他，低声说：“啊，伟大的哥白尼，你怎么来得这样晚？整整过去了三轮文明，你错过了多么伟大的事业啊！”\n   “那是什么？”汪淼指指太空中的星体阵列问。\n   “那是伟大的三体星际舰队，马上就要起航远征了。”\n   “这么说，三体文明已经具备了星际远航的能力？”\n   “是的，那些宏伟的飞船都能达到十分之一光速。”\n   “达到十分之一的光速，至少在我的知识范围内是一个伟大的成就，但对于星际航行来说，还是慢了些。”\n   “千里之行始于足下，”那人说，“关键是要找对目标。”\n   “舰队的目的地是哪里呢？”\n   “四光年外的一颗带有行星的恒星，那是距三体世界最近的恒星。”\n   汪淼有些惊奇：“距我们最近的恒星也是四光年。”\n   “你们？”\n   “地球。”\n   “哦，这有没什么可奇怪的，在银河系的大片区域，恒星的密度十分均匀，这是星群引力漫长调节的结果。占相当大比例的恒星，之间的间距就是在三到六�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>三体<|>ORGANIZATION<|>三体 is a
