Often, the pieces were scattered—the mouth on one face, those piercing eyes on another and countless mixtures. Sometimes, though, one person carried it all and then you saw the pride, that inner knowledge:\n“lam one of them!”\nGammu’s natives recognized it and gave it walkway room but few labeled it.\nUnderlying all of this was what the Harkonnens had left behind—genetic lines tracing far away into the dawn times of Greek and Pathan and Mameluke, shadows of ancient history that few outside of professional historians or those trained by the Bene Gesserit could even name.\nTaraza and her party caught up with Teg. He heard her say to Odrade: “You must tell Miles all of it.”\nVery well, she would tell him, he thought. He turned and led the way past the inner guards to the long passage under the pillboxes into the Keep proper.\nDamn the Bene Gesserit! he thought. What were they really doing here on Gammu?\nPlenty of Bene Gesserit signs could be seen on this planet: the back-breeding to fix selected traits, and here\nand there a visible emphasis on seductive eyes for women.\nTeg returned a guard captain’s salute without changing focus. Seductive eyes, yes. He had seen this soon after his arrival at the ghola’s Keep and especially during his first inspection tour of the planet. He had seen himself in many faces, too, and recalled the thing old Patrin had mentioned SO many times.\n“You have the Gammu look, Bashar.”\nSeductive eyes! That guard captain back there had them. She and Odrade and Lucilla were alike in this. Few people paid much attention to the importance of eyes when it came to seduction, he thought. It took a Bene Gesserit upbringing to make that point. Big breasts in a woman and hard loins in a man (that tightly muscular look to the buttocks)—these were naturally important in sexual matchings. But without the eyes, the rest of it could go for nothing. Eyes were essential. You could drown in the right kind of eyes, he had learned, sink right into them and be unaware of what was being done to you until penis was firmly clasped in vagina.\nHe had noted Lucilla’s eyes immediately after his arrival on Gammu and had walked cautiously. No doubts about how the Sisterhood used her talents!\nThere was Lucilla now, waiting at the central inspection and decontamination chamber. She gave him the flickering handsign that all was well with the ghola. Teg relaxed and watched as Lucilla and Odrade confronted each other. The two women had remarkably similar features despite the age difference. Their bodies were quite different, though, Lucilla more solid against Odrade’s willowy form.\nThe guard captain of the seductive eyes came up beside Teg and leaned close to him. “Schwangyu has just learned who you brought back with you,” she said, nodding toward Taraza. “Ahhh, there she is now.”\nSchwangyu stepped from a lift tube and crossed to Taraza, giving only an angry glare to Teg.\nTaraza wanted to surprise you, he thought. We all know why.\n“You don’t appear happy to see me,” Taraza said, addressing Schwangyu.\n“I am surprised, Mother Superior,” Schwangyu said. “l had no idea.” She glanced once more at Teg, a look of venom in her eyes.\nOdrade and Lucilla broke off their mutual examination. “l had heard about it, of course,” Odrade said, “but itis a stopper to confront yourself in the face of another person.”\n“| warned you,” Taraza said.\n“What are your orders, Mother Superior?” Schwangyu asked. It was as close as she could come to asking the purpose of Taraza’s visit.\n“I would like a private word with Lucilla,” Taraza said.\n“PIL have quarters prepared for you,” Schwangyu said.\n“Don’t bother,” Taraza said. “I’m not staying. Miles has already arranged for my transport. Duty requires my presence at Chapter House. Lucilla and | will talk outside in the courtyard.” Taraza put a finger to her cheek. “Oh, and I'd like to watch the ghola unobserved for a few minutes. I’m sure Lucilla can arrange it.”\n“He’s taking the more intense training quite well,” Lucilla said as the two moved off toward a lift tube.\nTeg turned his attention to Odrade, noting as his gaze passed across Schwangyu’s face the intensity of her anger. She was not trying to conceal it.\nWas Lucilla a sister or a daughter of Odrade? Teg wondered. It occurred to him suddenly that there must be a Bene Gesserit purpose behind the resemblance. Yes, of course—Lucilla was an Imprinter!\nSchwangyu overcame her anger. She looked with curiosity at Odrade. “I was just about to take lunch, Sister,” Schwangyu said. “Would you care to join me?”\n“I must have a word alone with the Bashar,” Odrade said. “If it is all right, perhaps we could remain here for our talk? |\nmust not be seen by the ghola.”\nSchwangyu scowled, not trying to hide her upset from Odrade. They knew at Chapter House where loyalties lay! But no one...no one! would remove her from this post of observational command. Opposition had its rights!\nHer thoughts were clear even to Teg. He noted the stiffness of Schwangyu’s back as she left them.\n“It is bad when Sister is turned against Sister,” Odrade said.\nTeg gave a handsign to his guard captain, ordering her to clear the area. Alone, Odrade said. Alone it would be. To Odrade, he said: “This is one of my areas. No spies or other means of observing us here.”\n“I thought as much,” Odrade said.\n“We have a service room over there.” Teg nodded to his left. “Furniture, even chairdogs if you prefer.”\n“I hate it when they try to cuddle me,” she said. “Could we talk here?” She put a hand under Teg’s arm. “Perhaps we could walk a bit. | got so stiff sitting in that lighter.”\n“What is it you’re supposed to tell me?” he asked as they strolled.\n“My memories are no longer selectively filtered,” she said. “I have them all, only on the female side, naturally.”\n“So?” Teg pursed his lips. This was not the overture he had expected. Odrade appeared more like one who would take off on a direct approach.\n“Taraza says you have read the Atreides Manifesto. Good. You know it will cause upset in many quarters.”\n“Schwangyu already has made it the subject of a diatribe against ‘you Atreides.’”\nOdrade stared at him solemnly. As the reports all said, Teg remained an imposing figure, but she had known that without the reports.\n“We are both Atreides, you and l,” Odrade said.\nTeg came to full alert.\n“Your mother explained that to you in detail,” Odrade said, “when you took your first school leave back to Lernaeus.”\nTeg stopped and stared down at her. How could she know this? To his knowledge, he had never before met and conversed with this remote Darwi Odrade. Was he the Subject of special discussions at Chapter House? He held his silence, forcing her to carry the conversation.\n“I will recount a conversation between a man and my birth-mother,” Odrade said. “They are in bed and the man says: ‘I fathered a few children when | first escaped from the close bondage of the Bene Gesserit, back when | thought myself an independent agent, free to enlist and fight anywhere | chose.’”\nTeg did not try to conceal his surprise. Those were his own words! Mentat memory told him Odrade had them down as accurately as a mechanical recorder. Even the tone!\n“More?” she asked as he continued to stare at her. “Very well. The man says: ‘That was before they sent me to Mentat training, of course. What an eye-opener that was! | had never been out of the Sisterhood’s sight for an instant! | was never a free agent.’”\n“Not even when | spoke those words,” Teg said.\n“True.” She urged him by pressure on his arm as they continued their stroll across the chamber. “The children you fathered all belonged to the Bene Gesserit. The Sisterhood takes no chances that our genotype will be sent into the wild gene pool.”\n“Let my body go to Shaitan, their precious genotype remains in Sisterhood care,” he said.\n“My care,” Odrade said. “I am one of your daughters.”\nAgain, he forced her to stop.\n“I think you know who my mother was,” she said. She held up a hand for silence as he started to respond. “Names are not necessary.”\nTeg studied Odrade’s features, seeing the recognizable signs there. Mother and daughter were matched. But what of Lucilla?\nAs though she heard his question, Odrade said: “Lucilla is from a parallel breeding line. Quite remarkable, isn’t it, what careful breed-matching can achieve?”\nTeg cleared his throat. He felt no emotional attachment to this newly revealed daughter. Her words and other important signals of her performance demanded his primary attention.\n“This is no casual conversation,” he said. “Is this all of what you were to reveal to me? | thought the Mother Superior said...”\n“There is more,” Odrade agreed. “The Manifesto—| am its author. | wrote it at Taraza’s orders and following her detailed instructions.”\nTeg glanced around the large chamber as though to make sure no one overheard. He spoke in a lowered voice: “The Tleilaxu are spreading it far and wide!”\n“Just as we hoped.”\n“Why are you telling me this? Taraza said you were to prepare me for...”\n“There will come a time when you must know our purpose. It is Taraza’s wish that you make your own decisions then, that you really become a free agent.”\nEven as she spoke, Odrade saw the Mentat glaze in his eyes.\nTeg breathed deeply. Dependencies and key logs! He felt the Mentat sense of an enormous pattern just beyond the reach of his accumulated data. He did not even consider for an instant that some form of filial devotion had prompted these revelations. There was a fundamentalist, dogmatic, and ritualistic essence apparent in all Bene Gesserit training despite every effort to prevent this. Odrade, this daughter out of his past, was a full Reverend Mother with extraordinary powers of muscle and nerve control—full\nmemories on the female side! She was one of the special ones! She knew tricks of violence that few humans ever suspected. Still, that similarity, that essence remained and a Mentat always saw it.\nWhat does she want?\nAffirmation of his paternity? She already had all of the confirmation she could need.\nObserving her now, the way she waited so patiently for his thoughts to resolve, Teg reflected that it often was said with truth that Reverend Mothers no longer were completely members of the human race. They moved somehow outside the main flow, perhaps parallel to it, perhaps diving into it occasionally for their own purposes, but always removed from humankind. They removed themselves. It was an identifying mark of the Reverend Mother, a sense of extra identity that made them closer to the long-dead Tyrant than\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7f6f5e72e383e59748d00ad6b16de5bbe9e8aa100c58c1e0ccd401c60e00d7cd_v2"}
