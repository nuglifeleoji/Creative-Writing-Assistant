\n　　“另外，从政治路线方面说，咱们贫下中农应该占领教育阵地。可咱们村两个教师，一个是地主家的儿媳妇姚淑芳；另外一个金成虽然是俊山的娃娃，但成份也是中农。咱们学校的教师，连一个贫下中农也没有啊！这怎么行呢？只要从这方面把问题提出来，他队里的其他领导人也没话可说！” \n　　田福堂越听越觉得玉亭说的有道理。他从箱盖上的烟盒里给玉亭拿了一根纸烟，然后手在头皮上搔了半天，说：“也许这事能办哩！但要开个会通过才行。” \n　　“咱们马上就召开支部会讨论！”孙玉亭鼻子嘴里烟雾大冒，性急地对书记建议。 \n　　田福堂又搔了半天头皮，才说：“玉亭，你是个精明人，应该想到，这事牵扯我润生，因此我不能出面召开这会……能不能这样，干脆你来给咱出面！你是学校的贫管会主任嘛！你出面名正言顺！只要贫管会通过了，大队支部没理由反对！就是有人反对，那时我出来说话就主动了！” \n　　“没问题！我今晚上就召集贫管会开会，专门讨论这事！”田福堂马上又补充说：“要办初中，恐怕还得增加两个教师。那就先考虑让你哥家的少平去。润生嘛，只要大家同意，我也就不推辞，让娃娃到学校去锻炼上几年！”“按文件规定，农村当教师也算劳动锻炼，到时门外有工作和学习的机会，就能符合推荐条件了……” \n　　“这我知道哩。”田福堂说。 \n　　孙玉亭从田福堂家出来后，已经快到吃午饭的时候。他也没回家去，穿着那双缀麻绳子的烂布鞋，绞着两条腿匆忙地向后村头他哥家走去。 \n　　玉亭一路上很激动。他又一次感到自己在双水村是个举足轻重、有智有谋的人物。连田福堂都感到头疼的问题，他孙玉亭三下五除二就迎刃而解了。不用说，福堂将因此而更会器重他的。不论是从政治上还是其它方面说，他想他当然是双水村革命事业的接班人。将来福堂和俊山年纪大了，就看他带领双水村人民，继续沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进哩！ \n　　另外，他还高兴的是，在村里办个初中班，他哥家的少平也能到学校去教书。 \n　　作为村里学校的贫管会主任，孙玉亭一直为贫下中农没有占领这块教育阵地而感到很痛心。金光明的老婆姚淑芳，一天穿戴得象个资产阶级小姐，怎么能教育好贫下中农的后代？只是她属于公派教师，他把这女人没办法。他前几年曾\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
