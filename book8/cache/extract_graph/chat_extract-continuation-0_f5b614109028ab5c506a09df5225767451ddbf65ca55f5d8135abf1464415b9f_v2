蓝轩宇道：“我的武魂算是变异蓝银草吧。”他也没隐瞒，双手翻开，金纹蓝银草、银纹蓝银草分别出现。\n\n    “金纹蓝银草主力量，银纹蓝银草是水元素掌控。”\n\n    “难怪你能撞开金翔呢。这金翔平时可嚣张了，正好今天你教训教训他。我也来介绍一下我的武魂。”钱磊笑呵呵的说道：“我的武魂比较特殊哈，你要有心理准备。”\n\n    蓝轩宇好奇的问道：“你的武魂是什么呢？”\n\n    钱磊笑道：“你看我姓什么？”\n\n    “钱？”蓝轩宇疑惑的道。\n\n    “对呀，这就是我的武魂。我的武魂就是钱。”一边说着，他右手一翻，一枚金币就出现在他掌心之中。\n\n    “武魂是钱？”蓝轩宇目瞪口呆，他还从未听说过有这种武魂的，就连蓝潇都没讲过。\n\n
