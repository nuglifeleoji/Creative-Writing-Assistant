\n　　最后一丝侥幸心理荡然无存。这已经无可辩驳地再一次说明，她身上肯定发生了非同寻常的事。要不，她总会和他说点什么的，因为他已经对她明显地表现出了反常的情绪！他索性脱下衣服，蒙住头睡在被子里。 \n　　他听见她在洗漱；在脱衣服；在拉被子；并且在他旁边睡下了。 \n　　长时间的无声无息。 \n　　过了好一会，他感到她的手在隔着被子轻轻扳他的肩膀，并且小声问：“你……怎么啦？”

\n　　“我也不知道。我一直爱你，但在感情上不能全部得到满足。你虽然知识面也较宽阔，但你和我谈论政治人事太多了，我对这些不感兴趣，但我尊重你的工作和爱好。我有我自己的爱好和感情要求，你不能全部满足我。就是这样。未认识古风铃之前，我由于找不到和我精神相通的朋友，只能压抑我的感情。但我现在终于找到了这样的人……”“那么，咱们商量个办法吧！怎样离婚？” \n　　“离婚？我可没这样想过！”
