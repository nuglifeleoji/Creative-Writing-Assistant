Both generals engaged in discussions regarding military tactics, particularly focusing on the surveillance of their adversary, 邓艾 (Deng Ai). This indicates a shared concern for monitoring potential threats and highlights their strategic foresight in military planning.\n\nMoreover, 钟会 and 姜维 formed a strategic alliance, conspiring together to plot against their enemies. This collaboration suggests a mutual understanding and a common goal in their military endeavors, as they sought to strengthen their positions against rival forces. Their partnership reflects the complexities of alliances during this tumultuous period, where trust and cooperation were essential for survival and success in the face of external challenges.\n\nOverall, the interactions between 钟会 and 姜维 illustrate their commitment to military strategy and their efforts to navigate the intricate political landscape of their time, particularly in relation to the threat posed by 邓艾.
