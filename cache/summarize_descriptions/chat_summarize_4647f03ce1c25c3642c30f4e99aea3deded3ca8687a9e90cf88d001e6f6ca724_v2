Primarily known for its monopoly over the spice melange from Arrakis, CHOAM wields immense influence, with its directorships determining wealth and power among noble Houses. The company operates as a commercial empire under the oversight of the Emperor, though its control was later stripped by Paul Atreides as part of a political maneuver.  \n\nCHOAM’s economic dominance extends beyond spice trade, encompassing broader commerce in the Known Universe. Its banners and flags serve as political symbols, even used by the Emperor to signal authority. The company’s presence is marked by its proximity to powerful factions, such as the Harkonnens, with the Baron himself holding a directorship, underscoring its role in inter-House politics.  \n\nAs the primary entity regulating trade and resources, CHOAM is integral to the Imperium’s stability, making it a focal point of power struggles. Its control over the spice melange—a substance critical for space travel, longevity, and prescience—cements its unrivaled economic and strategic importance.
