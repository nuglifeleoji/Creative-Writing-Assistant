This old house holds deep emotional value, as it is intertwined with 鲁迅's memories and experiences. The house has been sold, marking a poignant transition for the narrator, who is in the process of leaving it behind. As they clear out the items within, the act of packing and sorting through the belongings evokes a sense of nostalgia and reflection on the past.\n\nThe old house serves as a physical representation of the narrator's history and familial connections, encapsulating moments that have shaped their identity. It is not merely a structure but a repository of memories, each room and item telling a story of the family's legacy. The sale of 老屋 signifies not only a change in residence but also a farewell to a cherished chapter of life, filled with both joy and sorrow.\n\nIn summary, 老屋 is a poignant symbol of heritage and memory, representing the intersection of personal history and familial ties, particularly in relation to 鲁迅's legacy.
