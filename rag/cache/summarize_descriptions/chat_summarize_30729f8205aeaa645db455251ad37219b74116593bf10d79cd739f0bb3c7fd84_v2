Esmar Tuek met a tragic end, reportedly killed either by the Harkonnens—the ruthless ruling house of Arrakis—or by a traitor, though the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear. Despite this ambiguity, his legacy endured through his son and his reputation as a key player in the illicit activities that thrived in the harsh desert world.
