是因为看到了工藤吧，靖子想。石神或许在诧异，那个和她亲密交谈的男人究竟是什么人。也许是渴望打听工藤底细的念头，让他说出最后那个奇怪的问题。\n    靖子很清楚石神为何会帮助他们母女，大概就如小代子他们说的，是对靖子有意思。\n    然而如果她和别的男人走得很近又会如何？他还会像之前一样尽力帮助她们吗？还会为她们母女绞尽脑汁吗？\n    或许还是别见工藤比较好，靖子想。就算要见面，也不能让石神发觉。\n    可是这么一想，旋即有种难以言喻的焦虑弥漫心头。\n    要到什么时候为止？得这样背着石神偷偷摸摸到几时？难道说，只要命案一天没过追诉期限，自己就永远无法和其他男人在一起吗――？\n\n----------------------------------第七章完-------------------------------------\n第八章\n鞋底滑过发出咻咻的声音，几乎在同时，也传来细小的破裂声。对草S来说这个声音颇令人怀念。\n    他站在体育馆入口，往里窥探，汤川正在靠入口的这个球场上握拍迎战。他大腿的肌肉，比起年轻时果然好像有点松弛了，不过架势倒是没变。\n    对手看来是个学生，球技相当不错，连汤川刁钻的攻势也没能把他耍的团团转。\n    学生的杀球得分了，汤川当场跌坐在地，他满脸苦笑的对着学生说着什么。\n    他瞥见草S，对学生打个招呼后，拿着球拍走来。\n    “今天又有什么贵干？”\n    听见汤川的质问，草S故意做出要跌倒的动作。\n    “你这样说话太过分了。明明就是你打电话来，我以为你找我有事，才特地跑来的。”\n    草S的手机，留着汤川打来的记录。\n    “这样啊。因为没什么大事，所以我没留言。我是好心怕打扰你，看你连手机都关机了，你一定很忙吧。”\n    “你打来时我正在看电影。”\n    “电影？在执勤时间？您可真悠哉啊。”\n    “才不是，是为了确认那个不在场证明。我想还是该看看是什么电影，要不然，怎么确定嫌疑犯说的是真是假。”\n    “反正不管怎么说都是桩好差事。”\n    “为了工作看电影，一点乐趣也没有。既然没什么大事，早知道就不要特地跑来了。我本来打去你研究室，他们说你在体育馆。”\n    “那你既然已经来了，就一起吃个饭吧，而且我的确找你有事。”汤川在入口换上随地乱脱的鞋子。\n    “到底是什么事？”\n    “就是那件事啊。”汤川边迈步走出边说。\n    “哪件事？”\n    “电影院的事。”\n    他们走进大学旁边的居酒屋，草S念书时还没有这间店。两人在最里面那张桌子落座。\n    “嫌疑犯说她们去看电影，是在案发的本月十日，而�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
