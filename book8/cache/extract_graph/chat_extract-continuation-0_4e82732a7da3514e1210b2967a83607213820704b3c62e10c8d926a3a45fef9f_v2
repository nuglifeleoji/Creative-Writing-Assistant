耸了耸肩膀，道：“有什么关系呢？我对他的期望可不是在个人战斗力方面，而是继承我的衣钵啊！个人实力再强，能和一支宇宙舰队相比吗？”\n\n    季洪彬眼含深意的看了他一眼，“这话你去那里说。看看会不会有人反驳你。”一边说着，他抬手指了指上方。\n\n    银天凡滞了滞，“我说的是正常情况下。轩宇这孩子精神力提升如此之快，我估计他最多十二岁，就能达到灵海境精神层次。到了那个时候，我就可以开始教导他真正的战舰基础知识，等到二十岁的时候，很可能他就有资格成为一名合格的舰长了。按照这个速度发展，三十岁，就有可能成为一支舰队的指挥官。如果他能够考上那里，这个时间甚至还会缩短许多。这孩子最重要的是心理素质和抗压能力，这方面我对他很满意。小小年纪就展现出非同一般的天赋。”\n\n    季洪彬瞥了他一眼，脸上突然难得的流露出一丝笑容，“胖子，我们商量个事情怎么样？”\n\n    银天凡也笑了，笑眯眯的看上去十分的和蔼，“老季啊！你要是向让他改投你门下，这种话就不用说了。”\n\n    季洪彬没好气的道：“你真是头狡猾的老狐狸。这孩子跟了你，只会是浪费了天赋，你难道看不出，他的武魂有多么特殊么？完全有成为一名顶尖强者，甚至是一个顶尖强者小队的领袖核心。这方面你能给他？”\n\n    银天凡哈哈一笑，“不管，反正他现在是我的弟子，是管我叫师傅的。你早干嘛去了？你早怎么不收他？”\n\n

本来在他们的计划中，钱磊应该可以完成四次召唤的，但意外出现在第二次召唤上，翠魔鸟的召唤，不只是不太受控制，同时，那翠魔鸟本身也消耗了更多钱磊的精神力，在尝试控制的过程中，消耗极大。\n\n    所以，完成三次召唤之后，钱磊的精神力就已经告罄了。\n\n
