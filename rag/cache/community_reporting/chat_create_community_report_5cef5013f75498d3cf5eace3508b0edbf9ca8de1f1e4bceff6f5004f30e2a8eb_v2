She is the mother of Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib) and Alia, as well as the grandmother of Leto II and Ghanima. A highly skilled Reverend Mother, Jessica defied the Bene Gesserit breeding program by bearing a son instead of a daughter, an act that had profound consequences for the Sisterhood and the galactic political landscape.  \n\nTrained by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Jessica possesses advanced mental and physical abilities, including mastery of prana-bindu techniques, which she later teaches to others, such as Farad’n. Her political acumen and latent psychic abilities played a crucial role in shaping Arrakis’s prophetic legends and the rise of Paul as the Kwisatz Haderach. Despite her loyalty to House Atreides, she was falsely accused of treachery by Thufir Hawat and targeted by Baron Harkonnen as part of his revenge plot.  \n\nJessica’s relationship with the Bene Gesserit is complex—she temporarily broke with the Sisterhood out of love for Duke Leto but later returned, reconciling with their ways. After Paul’s ascension, she became a Fremen Reverend Mother, though she grew wary of the religious fervor surrounding him. In her later years, she guided the education of Leto II and Ghanima, ensuring they avoided Alia’s tragic fate.  \n\nHer legacy endures as a historical figure whose heresy and defiance reshaped the Bene Gesserit’s plans. Whether as a captive of House Corrino, a mentor, or a political player, Jessica remains a pivotal force in the Atreides lineage and the broader saga of *Dune*.\",53\n4,BENE GESSERIT,\"The **Bene Gesserit** is a secretive, ancient, and powerful matriarchal sisterhood with profound political, religious, and genetic influence across the universe. Founded after the Butlerian Jihad, this order specializes in advanced mental and physical training, including techniques such as **Voice**, **Truthsaying**, and **Mentat**-like abilities. Members like **Lady Jessica**, **Gaius Helen Mohiam**, **Irulan**, **Odrade**, **Lucilla**, and **Margot Lady Fenring** undergo rigorous conditioning to master control over themselves and others.  \n\nCentral to their mission is a millennia-spanning **breeding program** aimed at producing the **Kwisatz Haderach**, a superbeing capable of bridging time and space. They manipulate bloodlines—including the **Atreides**—to shape human evolution, though their plans are often disrupted by figures like **Leto II**, whose **Fish Speakers** they view as rivals, or the rise of **Alia**, whom they label an \"\"Abomination.\"\" They employ the **Missionaria Protectiva**, implanting religious myths (e.g., among the **Fremen**) to secure long-term goals.  \n\nPolitically, the Bene Gesserit wield influence through covert alliances, espionage, and strategic marriages, clashing with factions like the **Honored Matres**, **Bene Tleilax**, and the **God Emperor**. Their **Other Memory** grants ancestral knowledge, and they enforce strict doctrines under leaders like **Mother Superior Odrade** and later **Murbella**, navigating existential threats like the **Scattering**.  \n\nDespite their manipulative reputation, they see themselves as shepherds of humanity’s future, balancing pragmatism with perfected governance. Their advanced abilities—such as immunity to disease, the **Litany Against Fear**, and the **Agony** (to create Reverend Mothers)—complement their deep involvement in spice-related projects, genetic manipulation, and conflicts like the battle against the Honored Matres.  \n\nThe Bene Gesserit also train individuals like **Farad’n**, **Hwi Noree**, and **Duncan Idaho**, imprinting knowledge and manipulating events. They serve as a silent partner in **CHOAM** and maintain embassies like the one at **Keen**, monitoring key figures such as **Sheeana**. While feared as \"\"witches,\"\" they avoid direct confrontation, preferring subterfuge.  \n\nIn summary, the Bene Gesserit is a formidable force—combining genetic mastery, psychic prowess, and political acumen—to steer civilization’s destiny. Their legacy endures through figures like **Paul Atreides**, whose abilities stem from their training, and their relentless pursuit of control over the universe’s genetic and political future.\",240\n1545,TARAZA,\"**Taraza**, also known as **Alma Mavis Taraza**, was the **Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood**, a powerful and strategic leader deeply involved in the Sisterhood’s political, military, and genetic programs. As a **Reverend Mother**, she wielded immense authority, overseeing critical missions, negotiations, and the training of key figures such as **Odrade, Miles Teg, Lucilla, Duncan Idaho, and Sheeana**.  \n\nTaraza was a master tactician, orchestrating high-stakes plans involving the **ghola project**, negotiations with the **Tleilaxu**, and countering threats from the **Honored Matres** and the **Scattering**. She issued directives to Teg and Lucilla regarding Duncan Idaho’s conditioning, ensuring his loyalty and awakening his original memories. Her foresight was instrumental in predicting Duncan’s independence and shaping the Sisterhood’s long-term strategies.  \n\nShe maintained a close relationship with **Miles Teg**, amplifying his abilities and relying on his military expertise, though she was willing to sacrifice him if necessary for the Sisterhood’s survival. Taraza also monitored **Sheeana’s** development, recognizing her potential in the Sisterhood’s future.  \n\nDespite her formidable leadership, Taraza faced internal opposition and fatigue, particularly concerning controversial decisions like the ghola project. Her tenure ended when she was **killed in an attack by the Honored Matres**, but her memories and wisdom were preserved within **Odrade**, her successor, ensuring her influence endured.  \n\nTaraza’s legacy remained pivotal in Bene Gesserit history—her strategic designs, warnings about the Honored Matres, and philosophical insights continued to guide the Sisterhood long after her death. She was remembered as a **savior of the Sisterhood**, her persona studied by postulants and her decisions shaping the order’s survival in a turbulent universe.\",49\n32,REVEREND MOTHER,\"**Summary of the REVEREND MOTHER:**  \n\nThe **Reverend Mother** is a high-ranking title within the **Bene Gesserit Sisterhood**, denoting an elder adept who has undergone the **spice agony**, granting access to **ancestral memories** and heightened mental and physical abilities. These individuals, such as **Gaius Helen Mohiam, Lucilla, Schwangyu, Bellonda, Odrade, and Anteac**, hold significant political and spiritual influence across the Imperium. They are deeply involved in the **Bene Gesserit’s breeding programs**, genetic manipulations, and prophetic schemes—particularly concerning the **Kwisatz Haderach**—while also serving as **Truthsayers** and advisors to powerful figures like the **Emperor** and **Paul Atreides**.  \n\nAs a **teacher and mentor**, the Reverend Mother instructs Bene Gesserit acolytes like **Lady Jessica** in espionage, governance, and the Sisterhood’s doctrines. She is known for administering the **pain box test** to Paul Atreides, assessing his humanity and potential as a leader. However, she is also **distrustful of Jessica** for defying the Sisterhood’s orders by bearing a son (Paul) instead of a daughter, disrupting their genetic plans.  \n\nHer role extends beyond politics into **spiritual leadership**, particularly among the **Fremen**, where she oversees rituals involving the **Water of Life** and guides the community in times of crisis, such as after **Liet-Kynes’ death**. Despite her wisdom, she is **ruthless in enforcing the Bene Gesserit agenda**, as seen when she orders drastic measures to prevent **Chani from conceiving**, fearing uncontrolled genetic outcomes.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize her **authoritative, manipulative nature**—plotting against Paul-Muad’Dib or expressing outrage over deviations from the breeding program—others highlight her **advisory role**, counseling Paul on rulership and the dangers of Arrakis. These contradictions reflect the **Bene Gesserit’s dual nature**: outwardly serene spiritual guides, yet covertly calculating strategists.  \n\nIn summary, the **Reverend Mother** is a **multifaceted figure**—simultaneously a **teacher, Truthsayer, political schemer, and spiritual leader**—whose actions are driven by the Bene Gesserit’s long-term vision for humanity’s evolution. Her influence spans from the Imperial court to the Fremen sietches, making her one of the most powerful and enigmatic figures in the universe.  \n\n*(Word count: 300)*\",18\n1662,CHENOEH,\"**CHENOEH** is a revered historical figure within the Bene Gesserit tradition, embodying both spiritual and symbolic significance. Represented by a bust in Odrade's workroom and a statuette used by Taraza for calming rituals, Chenoeh holds a prominent place in Bene Gesserit culture, suggesting deep historical or spiritual importance. The figure is also acknowledged as a symbolic guardian of Chapter House, representing those who failed the spice agony—a role that underscores the Bene Gesserit's reverence for perseverance and sacrifice.  \n\nChenoeh is referenced by the Tyrant in a statement about the Bene Gesserit, further cementing their influence. Additionally, they are recognized as a philosopher who authored *\"\"Conversations with Leto II,\"\"* indicating a role in shaping Bene Gesserit thought. The title *\"\"Saintly Chenoeh\"\"* and the epithet *\"\"Beloved of God\"\"* highlight their sanctified status among Reverend Mothers, portraying them as a figure of divine favor and wisdom.  \n\nDespite slight variations in descriptions—such as being depicted as both a symbolic guardian and a saintly philosopher—the overarching narrative presents Chenoeh as a multifaceted, deeply respected entity within Bene Gesserit history, embodying themes of resilience, intellectual contribution, and spiritual devotion.\",4\n328,AMTAL RULE,\"The **Amtal Rule** is a significant concept with dual interpretations in Fremen and Bene Gesserit traditions. Among the Fremen, it is a custom permitting challenges to test the validity of claims, often invoked to justify combat. For instance, Jamis used the Amtal Rule to legitimize his duel with Paul Atreides, framing it as a means to reveal the truth through physical confrontation.  \n\nConversely, the Bene Gesserit interpret the Amtal Rule as a broader philosophical principle, asserting that the true nature of a person or object is only revealed when pushed beyond its limits. This version emphasizes testing endurance, resilience, or capability under extreme conditions, aligning with the Bene Gesserit's focus on human potential and manipulation.  \n\nWhile the Fremen application is more immediate and combative, and the Bene Gesserit's is abstract and analytical, both interpretations share the core idea that truth or essence is uncovered through rigorous testing. The Amtal Rule thus serves as both a cultural practice among the Fremen and a strategic doctrine for the Bene Gesserit, reflecting its adaptability across different contexts.\",3\n1358,FISH SPEAKER GUARDS,\"The **Fish Speaker Guards** are an elite group of women who serve as personal protectors and enforcers for Leto. Described as highly disciplined and loyal, they are entrusted with critical security duties, including monitoring and restricting the movements of the Bene Gesserit during times of crisis. While one description suggests they are deaf and mute, another indicates they were heard whispering about Leto's troubled state, implying they are capable of speech and hearing. This apparent contradiction may reflect a misconception about their communication methods or a deliberate misdirection regarding their abilities.  \n\nTheir primary role revolves around safeguarding Leto, and their actions demonstrate their unwavering dedication to his rule. Whether enforcing his decrees or observing his condition, the Fish Speaker Guards remain a formidable and enigmatic presence in his service. The discrepancy in their described traits could stem from varying interpretations of their secrecy or specialized training, but their function as elite enforcers remains consistent across all accounts.\",2\n1554,SCRAMBLING,\"The dispersal of humanity known as the Scattering, referenced in relation to returning groups like the Honored Matres\"\"\",2\n541,ANIRUL,\"Wife of Shaddam IV, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank>\",1\n586,TRAINING,\"When applied to Bene Gesserit, refers to conditioning of nerve and muscle carried to the last possible notch permitted by natural function.\"\"\",1\n633,CARL GUSTAV JUNG,\"Carl Gustav Jung was a psychologist whose theories on collective unconscious influenced the Bene Gesserit\"\"\",1\n764,MOHIAM,\"A Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, involved in high-stakes negotiations with Paul\"\"\",1\n849,REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM,\"Reverend Mother Mohiam was a Bene Gesserit leader executed for treason against Paul.\"\"\",1\n1133,PHARAONIC IMPERIALISM,\"A political system that the Bene Gesserit plan to revive through Leto II\"\"\",1\n591,VOICE,\"A combined training by the Bene Gesserit permitting control of others through selected tone shadings.\"\"\",1\n1327,SISTERS CHENOEH AND TAWSUOKO,,1\n1326,CHAPTER HOUSE ARCHIVES,\"The Bene Gesserit's repository of historical records and knowledge\"\"\",1\n1357,JESUITS,\"The Jesuits are a historical religious group referenced by Leto as an example of rhetorical despotism.\"\"\",1\n1571,SUK DOCTORS,Suk Doctors are medical specialists known for their rigorous training and ethical standards,1\n1620,FISH SPEAKER COUNCIL,\"The Fish Speaker Council inherited the core of the old Atreides Empire, involved in governance and military affairs.\"\"\",1\n1626,SCHOOL SISTERS,\"School Sisters are Bene Gesserit educators responsible for training acolytes like Miles Teg.\"\"\",1\n1673,RAKIAN SUPPLY,\"The flow of melange from Rakis, which the Bene Gesserit can restrict to punish the Guild>\",1\n1685,SISTER HESTERION,Sister Hesterion is a Bene Gesserit from Archives who provided analysis on the Tleilaxu,1\n1691,PRIMARY TRAINING,\"Bene Gesserit initial education phase that Odrade and others underwent\"\"\",1\n1709,MAJOR HOUSES,Powerful noble families emerging from suppression under the Golden Path,1\n1720,COLLEGE OF ANCESTRAL PERTINENCE,\"The official name for the Bene Gesserit's breeding records, abbreviated as CAP by Archivists.\"\"\",1\n1776,ALGAE,,1\n1779,KEPS,Bene Gesserit strongholds mentioned in relation to Chapter House,1\n1780,DEPENDENT CHAPTERS,Subsidiary branches of the Bene Gesserit network,1\n1781,OLD IMPERIUM,Historical period referenced in relation to human-occupied planets,1\n1795,BREEDING MISTRESSES,\"The **Breeding Mistresses** are specialized members of the Bene Gesserit order tasked with overseeing genetic programs and lineage management.

Their work is integral to the order's broader goals of shaping human evolution and maintaining political and biological influence across the universe.  \n\nCombining both descriptions, the Breeding Mistresses are confirmed as Bene Gesserit specialists dedicated to genetic oversight, reproduction, and lineage control, with their activities extending to high-profile cases such as Murbella's progeny.

These events created refugee populations, many of whom later became a lingering concern for the Bene Gesserit leadership, as their existence and movements posed unforeseen challenges. The term is notably mentioned by Odrade in her reflections, underscoring its importance as both a historical phenomenon and a subject of strategic contemplation for the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—one focusing on the disruptive aftermath of the Scatterings and the other on their exploratory nature—they collectively paint a picture of a transformative era. The Scatterings were not merely a time of forced displacement but also a period of expansion and discovery, with far-reaching consequences for the political and social order of the universe. The Bene Gesserit, ever watchful of shifts in power and population, viewed these events as both a haunting legacy and a potential source of instability.  \n\nIn summary, the **SCATTERINGS** represent a complex historical epoch characterized by mass migration, exploration, and enduring repercussions, particularly for the Bene Gesserit, who grappled with the long-term implications of these dispersed populations.\",1\n2082,HONORED MATRE VICTORY,\"A potential outcome feared by the Bene Gesserit\"\"\",1\n118,MAPES,\"**MAPES** is a Fremen housekeeper and servant in the Atreides household on Arrakis, deeply loyal to Lady Jessica and committed to Fremen traditions.

As the mother of **Paul Atreides** (later known as **Maud'Dib**), she plays a pivotal role in the Bene Gesserit's breeding program, though her defiance of the order—by bearing a son instead of the prescribed daughter—disrupts their plans and creates lasting tension within the Sisterhood.  \n\nJessica's loyalty to the Bene Gesserit is complex. While she is deeply ingrained in their ways, leverages their myths on **Arrakis**, and trains Paul in their disciplines, her disobedience marks her as a heretic in their eyes. This act of rebellion strains her relationship with the Sisterhood and fuels conflict, particularly with her daughter **Alia**, who resents Jessica's continued ties to the order. Despite this, Jessica remains bound by their teachings, employing their advanced abilities and political acumen in service of **House Atreides**, thereby linking the Bene Gesserit to the fate of the noble house.  \n\nHer actions have far-reaching consequences, altering the Bene Gesserit's breeding program and challenging their control over the galactic power structure. Though some accounts suggest she later turns against the Sisterhood, her identity and strategies remain inextricably tied to their influence. Jessica embodies the duality of devotion and defiance, a figure whose choices reshape both her family's destiny and the Sisterhood's designs.\",293\n3676,TARAZA,BENE GESSERIT,\"**Taraza** is the **Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit**, the highest-ranking leader of the Sisterhood, and a pivotal figure in guiding its strategic, political, and philosophical endeavors. She directs the Bene Gesserit's long-term plans, including their critical involvement with key individuals such as **Duncan Idaho** and **Sheeana**, overseeing their observation and integration into the Sisterhood's schemes. Taraza's leadership is marked by profound loyalty to the Bene Gesserit, and she makes decisive choices that shape the order's survival and influence across the universe.  \n\nHer role encompasses not only governance but also high-stakes negotiations and the orchestration of the Bene Gesserit's intricate genetic and political machinations. Known for her strategic acumen, Taraza balances the Sisterhood's traditions with adaptive tactics, ensuring its continued dominance. Her past decisions and leadership continue to resonate, influencing the Bene Gesserit's current and future strategies.  \n\nAs Mother Superior, Taraza embodies the Bene Gesserit's ideals, wielding authority with wisdom and foresight. Whether directing covert operations or philosophical discourse, she remains a central force in the Sisterhood's pursuit of power and control.\",289\n7,BENE GESSERIT,KWISATZ HADERACH,\"The **Bene Gesserit**, a powerful and secretive sisterhood, have spent millennia orchestrating an intricate breeding program to produce the **Kwisatz Haderach**, a prophesied superbeing with heightened awareness and abilities. This figure is central to their genetic and political ambitions, intended to bridge space and time with prescient vision and unmatched control. Through generations of carefully manipulated bloodlines, the Bene Gesserit sought to create a male capable of accessing both feminine and masculine ancestral memories—a feat otherwise unattainable by their female-dominated order.  \n\nTheir plans culminated in **Paul Atreides (Paul-Muad'Dib)**, whom they bred as their intended Kwisatz Haderach. However, Paul defied their control, embodying both the fulfillment and the failure of their designs. While he possessed the abilities they sought, his independence and unpredictable power made him a threat rather than a tool. This outcome revealed the inherent flaw in their ambition: the Kwisatz Haderach, though a pinnacle of their breeding program, could not be fully controlled.  \n\nThe Bene Gesserit fear the emergence of another Kwisatz Haderach, as its power disrupts their carefully laid plans. The figure is both a goal and a danger—a symbol of their greatest achievement and their greatest vulnerability. Their mythology reveres and dreads the Kwisatz Haderach, recognizing its potential to reshape the universe beyond their influence. Despite their efforts to guide its creation, the Kwisatz Haderach remains an unpredictable force, embodying the paradox of their quest for ultimate power.  \n\nIn summary, the Bene Gesserit’s millennia-long pursuit of the Kwisatz Haderach reflects their ambition to master human evolution, yet their success with Paul-Muad'Dib underscores the peril of creating a being beyond their control. The Kwisatz Haderach remains a pivotal but fraught figure in their history, representing both their highest aspiration and their deepest fear.\",265\n46,REVEREND MOTHER,BENE GESSERIT,\"The **Reverend Mother** is a high-ranking and senior member of the **Bene Gesserit**, an influential and secretive sisterhood. As a key figure within the order, the Reverend Mother holds significant authority, particularly in overseeing the Bene Gesserit's rigorous tests and meticulously orchestrated breeding programs. These programs are central to the sisterhood's long-term plans, as they aim to produce individuals with specific genetic traits to further their goals. The Reverend Mother's role encompasses both leadership and stewardship, ensuring the Bene Gesserit's traditions and objectives are upheld. This position underscores her importance within the organization, where she operates at the highest echelons of power and influence.\",258\n3921,BENE GESSERIT,CHENOEH,\"The **Bene Gesserit** is a powerful and secretive sisterhood in the *Dune* universe, known for their political influence, psychic abilities, and rigorous training programs. Among their ranks, **Chenoeh** holds a unique and complex position. She is recognized as a **Reverend Mother**, a title bestowed upon those who have undergone the deadly ritual of the **Spice Agony** and gained access to ancestral memories. However, Chenoeh’s status is marked by contradiction: while some accounts revere her as a successful Reverend Mother, others venerate her as a **symbolic figure** despite being a **failed Reverend Mother**.  \n\nThis duality suggests that Chenoeh’s legacy within the Bene Gesserit is multifaceted. On one hand, she may have achieved the rank of Reverend Mother but failed to meet certain expectations, earning her a place as a cautionary or inspirational symbol. Alternatively, her \"\"failure\"\" could refer to an incomplete or unconventional transformation, yet her enduring veneration implies she holds significant ideological or spiritual importance to the sisterhood. The Bene Gesserit, pragmatic yet deeply ritualistic, may honor her as a reminder of the risks and sacrifices inherent in their traditions.  \n\nIn summary, **Chenoeh** is a prominent but enigmatic figure among the Bene Gesserit, celebrated as both a **Reverend Mother** and a symbolic representation of the order’s complexities. Her paradoxical portrayal underscores the Bene Gesserit’s nuanced relationship with success, failure, and legacy.\",244\n4815,AMTAL RULE,BENE GESSERIT,The Bene Gesserit cites the Amtal Rule as a guiding principle for understanding true nature under stress.,243\n3089,BENE GESSERIT,FISH SPEAKER GUARDS,Fish Speaker guards restrict the Bene Gesserit's movements during the crisis.,242\n3604,BENE GESSERIT,SCRAMBLING,The Bene Gesserit are concerned about groups returning from the Scattering,242\n1286,BENE GESSERIT,ANIRUL,Anirul was a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank and Shaddam IV's wife,241\n1354,TRAINING,BENE GESSERIT,The Bene Gesserit are known for their advanced nerve and muscle conditioning.,241\n1395,BENE GESSERIT,CARL GUSTAV JUNG,The Bene Gesserit's collective memory is based on Jung's theories,241\n1688,BENE GESSERIT,MOHIAM,Mohiam represents the Bene Gesserit in negotiations with Paul,241\n1861,BENE GESSERIT,REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM,Mohiam was a leader of the Bene Gesserit before her execution.,241\n2542,BENE GESSERIT,PHARAONIC IMPERIALISM,The Bene Gesserit plan to revive Pharaonic Imperialism through Leto II,241\n2866,BENE GESSERIT,VOICE,\"The Bene Gesserit are known for Voice techniques, which Leto has mastered beyond their capabilities\",241\n2990,BENE GESSERIT,SISTERS CHENOEH AND TAWSUOKO,The Sisters are members of the Bene Gesserit Order who reported on the God Emperor's activities,241\n2992,BENE GESSERIT,CHAPTER HOUSE ARCHIVES,The Archives contain the Bene Gesserit's historical records and knowledge,241\n3088,BENE GESSERIT,JESUITS,Leto compares the Bene Gesserit's methods to those of the historical Jesuits.,241\n3681,BENE GESSERIT,SUK DOCTORS,The Bene Gesserit interacts with Suk Doctors for specialized needs,241\n3763,BENE GESSERIT,FISH SPEAKER COUNCIL,The Bene Gesserit are superior to the Fish Speaker Council in influence.,241\n3766,BENE GESSERIT,SCHOOL SISTERS,School Sisters are part of the Bene Gesserit's educational apparatus.,241\n3951,BENE GESSERIT,RAKIAN SUPPLY,The Sisterhood controls Rakian melange supply as leverage against the Guild,241\n3988,BENE GESSERIT,SISTER HESTERION,Sister Hesterion is a Bene Gesserit archivist providing critical analysis,241\n4004,BENE GESSERIT,PRIMARY TRAINING,Primary Training is the foundational education for Bene Gesserit acolytes,241\n4040,BENE GESSERIT,MAJOR HOUSES,The Bene Gesserit interact with and influence Major Houses,241\n4088,BENE GESSERIT,COLLEGE OF ANCESTRAL PERTINENCE,The Sisterhood's breeding records are maintained under this official title.,241\n4287,BENE GESSERIT,ALGAE,The algae is used by Bene Gesserit allies to conceal their presence.,241\n4292,BENE GESSERIT,KEPS,The Bene Gesserit maintain Keeps as strongholds,241\n4293,BENE GESSERIT,DEPENDENT CHAPTERS,Dependent Chapters are part of the Bene Gesserit network,241\n4294,BENE GESSERIT,OLD IMPERIUM,The Bene Gesserit existed during the Old Imperium,241\n4345,BENE GESSERIT,BREEDING MISTRESSES,\"The **Bene Gesserit** is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with a long-term focus on genetic manipulation and political influence.
