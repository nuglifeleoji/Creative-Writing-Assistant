studying the shadowy figure beside him.\n“M’Lord, | can name every world our people touched in their migrations. | know the reaches of Imperial—”\n“The Golden Age of Earth, have you ever studied that?”\n“Earth? Golden Age?” Stilgar was irritated and puzzled. Why would Paul wish to discuss myths from the dawn of time? Stilgar’s mind still felt crammed with Zabulon data— computations from the staff mentats: two hundred and five attack frigates with thirty legions, support battalions, pacification cadres, Qizarate missionaries... the food requirements (he had the figures right here in his mind) and melange... weaponry, uniforms, medals ... urns for the ashes of the dead... the number of specialists—men to produce raw materials of propaganda, clerks, accountants... spies ... and spies upon the spies...\n“I brought the pulse-synchronizer attachment, also, m’Lord,” Korba ventured. He obviously sensed the tensions building between Paul and Stilgar and was disturbed by them.\nStilgar shook his head from side to side. Pulse- synchronizer? Why would Paul wish him to use a mnemonic flutter-system on a shigawire projector? Why scan for specific data in histories? This was mentat work! As usual, Stilgar found he couldn’t escape a deep suspicion at the thought of using a projector and attachments. The thing always immersed him in disturbing sensations, an overwhelming shower of data which his mind sorted out later, surprising him with information he had not known he possessed.\n“Sire, | came with the Zabulon computations,” Stilgar said.\n“Dehydrate the Zabulon computations!” Paul snapped, using the obscene Fremen term which meant that here was moisture no man could demean himself by touching.\n“M'Lord!”\n“Stilgar,” Paul said, “you urgently need a sense of balance which can come only from an understanding of long-term effects. What little information we have about the old times, the pittance of data which the Butlerians left us, Korba has brought it for you. Start with the Genghis Khan.”\n“Ghengis ... Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m’Lord?”\n“Oh, long before that. He killed . . . perhaps four million.”\n“He must’ve had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Lasbeams, perhaps, or...”\n“He didn’t kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way | kill, by sending out his legions. There’s another emperor | want you to note in passing—a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.”\n“Killed... by his legions?” Stilgar asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Not very impressive statistics, m’Lord.”\n“Very good, Stil.” Paul glanced at the reels in Korba’s hands. Korba stood with them as though he wished he could drop them and flee. “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since—”\n“Unbelievers!” Korba protested. “Unbelievers all!”\n“No,” Paul said. “Believers.”\n“My Liege makes a joke,” Korba said, voice trembling. “The Jihad has brought ten thousand worlds into the shining light of—”\n“Into the darkness,” Paul said. “We’ll be a hundred generations recovering from Muad’Dib’s Jihad. | find it hard to imagine that anyone will ever surpass this.” A barking laugh erupted from his throat.\n“What amuses Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked.\n“lam not amused. | merely had a sudden vision of the Emperor Hitler saying something similar. No doubt he did.” “No other ruler ever had your powers,” Korba argued.\n“Who would dare challenge you? Your legions control the\nknown universe and all the—”\n“The legions control,” Paul said. “I wonder if they know this?”\n“You control your legions, Sire,” Stilgar interrupted, and it was obvious from the tone of his voice that he suddenly felt his own position in that chain of command, his own hand guiding all that power.\nHaving set Stilgar’s thoughts in motion along the track he wanted, Paul turned his full attention to Korba, said: “Put the reels here on the divan.” As Korba obeyed, Paul said: “How goes the reception, Korba? Does my sister have everything well in hand?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.” Korba’s tone was wary. “And Chani watches from the spy hole. She suspects there may be Sardaukar in the Guild entourage.”\n“No doubt she’s correct,” Paul said. “The jackals gather.”\n“Bannerjee,” Stilgar said, naming the chief of Paul’s Security detail, “was worried earlier that some of them might try to penetrate the private areas of the Keep.”\n“Have they?”\n“Not yet.”\n“But there was some confusion in the formal gardens,” Korba said.\n“What sort of confusion?” Stilgar demanded.\nPaul nodded.\n“Strangers coming and going,” Korba said, “trampling the plants, whispered conversations—| heard reports of some disturbing remarks.”\n“Such as?” Paul asked.\n“Is this the way our taxes are spent? |'m told the Ambassador himself asked that question.”\n“| don’t find that surprising,” Paul said. “Were there many strangers in the gardens?”\n“Dozens, m’Lord.”\n“Bannerjee stationed picked troopers at the vulnerable doors, m’Lord,” Stilgar said. He turned as he spoke, allowing\nthe salon’s single remaining light to illuminate half his face. The peculiar lighting, the face, all touched a node of memory in Paul’s mind—something from the desert. Paul didn’t bother bringing it to full recall, his attention being focused on how Stilgar had pulled back mentally. The Fremen had a tight-skinned forehead which mirrored almost every thought flickering across his mind. He was suspicious now, profoundly suspicious of his Emperor’s odd behavior.\n“| don’t like the intrusion into the gardens,” Paul said. “Courtesy to guests is one thing, and the formal necessities of greeting an envoy, but this...”\n“I'll see to removing them,” Korba said. “Immediately.”\n“Wait!” Paul ordered as Korba started to turn.\nIn the abrupt stillness of the moment, Stilgar edged himself into a position where he could study Paul’s face. It was deftly done. Paul admired the way of it, an achievement devoid of any forwardness. It was a Fremen thing: slyness touched by respect for another’s privacy, a movement of necessity.\n“What time is it?” Paul asked.\n“Almost midnight, Sire,” Korba said.\n“Korba, I think you may be my finest creation,” Paul said.\n“Sire!” There was injury in Korba’s voice.\n“Do you feel awe of me?” Paul asked.\n“You are Paul-Muad’Dib who was Usul in our sietch,” Korba said. “You know my devotion to—”\n“Have you ever felt like an apostle?” Paul asked.\nKorba obviously misunderstood the words, but correctly interpreted the tone. “My Emperor knows | have a clean conscience!”\n“Shai-hulud save us,” Paul murmured.\nThe questioning silence of the moment was broken by the sound of someone whistling as he walked down the outer hall. The whistling was stilled by a guardsman’s barked command as it came opposite the door.\n“Korba, | think you may survive all this,” Paul said. And he read the growing light of understanding on Stilgar’s face.\n“The strangers in the gardens, Sire?” Stilgar asked.\n“Ahh, yes,” Paul said. “Have Bannerjee put them out, Stil. Korba will assist.”\n“Me, Sire?” Korba betrayed deep disquiet.\n“Some of my friends have forgotten they once were Fremen,” Paul said, speaking to Korba, but designing his words for Stilgar. “You will mark down the ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar and you will have them killed. Do it yourself. | want it done quietly and without undue disturbance. We must keep in mind that there’s more to religion and government than approving treaties and sermons.”\n“| obey the orders of Muad’Dib,” Korba whispered.\n“The Zabulon computations?” Stilgar asked.\n“Tomorrow,” Paul said. “And when the strangers are removed from the gardens, announce that the reception is ended. The party’s over, Stil.”\n“|I understand, m’Lord.”\n“I’m sure you do,” Paul said.\nHere lies a toppled god— His fall was not a small one. We did but build his pedestal, A narrow and a tall one.\n—TLEILAXU EPIGRAM\nlia crouched, resting elbows on knees, chin on fists,\nstared at the body on the dune—a few bones and some tattered flesh that once had been a young woman. The hands, the head, most of the upper torso were gone—eaten by the coriolis wind. The sand all around bore the tracks of her brother’s medics and questors. They were gone now, all excepting the mortuary attendants who stood to one side with Hayt, the ghola, waiting for her to finish her mysterious perusal of what had been written here.\nA wheat-colored sky enfolded the scene in the glaucous light common to midafternoon for these latitudes.\nThe body had been discovered several hours earlier by a low-flying courier whose instruments had detected a faint water trace where none should be. His call had brought the experts. And they had learned—what? That this had been a woman of about twenty years, Fremen, addicted to semuta... and she had died here in the crucible of the desert from the effects of a subtle poison of Tleilaxu origin.\nTo die in the desert was a common enough occurrence. But a Fremen addicted to semuta, this was such a rarity that Paul had sent her to examine the scene in the ways their mother had taught them.\nAlia felt that she had accomplished nothing here except to cast her own aura of mystery about a scene that was already mysterious enough. She heard the ghola’s feet stir the sand, looked at him. His attention rested momentarily\nupon the escort ‘thopters circling overhead like a flock of ravens.\nBeware of the Guild bearing gifts, Alia thought.\nThe mortuary ‘thopter and her own craft stood on the sand near a rock outcropping behind the ghola. Focusing on the grounded ’thopters filled Alia with a craving to be airborne and away from here.\nBut Paul had thought she might see something here which others would miss. She squirmed in her stillsuit. It felt raspingly unfamiliar after all the suitless months of city life. She studied the ghola, wondering if he might know something important about this peculiar death. A lock of his black-goat hair, she saw, had escaped his stillsuit hood. She sensed her hand longing to tuck that hair back into place.\nAs though lured by this thought, his gleaming gray metal eyes turned toward her. The eyes set her trembling and she tore her gaze away from him.\nA Fremen woman had died here from a poison called “the throat of hell.”\nA Fremen addicted to semuta.\nShe shared Paul’s disquiet at this conjunction.\nThe mortuary attendants waited patiently. This corpse contained not enough water for them to salvage. They felt no need to hurry. And they’d believe that Al", "ia with a craving to be airborne and away from here.\nBut Paul had thought she might see something here which others would miss. She squirmed in her stillsuit.

This corpse contained not enough water for them to salvage. They felt no need to hurry. And they’d believe that Alia, through some glyptic art, was reading a strange truth in these remains.\nNo strange truth came to her.\nThere was only a distant feeling of anger deep within her at the obvious thoughts in the attendants’ minds. It was a product of the damned religious mystery. She and her brother could not be people. They had to be something more. The Bene Gesserit had seen to that by manipulating Atreides ancestry. Their mother had contributed to it by thrusting them onto the path of witchery.\nAnd Paul perpetuated the difference.\nThe Reverend Mothers encapsulated in Alia’s memories stirred restlessly, provoking adab flashes of thought: “Peace,\nLittle One! You are what you are. There are compensations.”\nCompensations!\nShe summoned the ghola with a gesture.\nHe stopped beside her, attentive, patient.\n“What do you see in this?” she asked.\n“We may never learn who it was died here,” he said. “The head, the teeth are gone. The hands... . Unlikely such a one had a genetic record somewhere to which her cells could be matched.”\n“Tleilaxu poison,” she said. “What do you make of that?”\n“Many people buy such poisons.”\n“True enough. And this flesh is too far gone to be regrown as was done with your body.”\n“Even if you could trust the Tleilaxu to do it,” he said.\nShe nodded, stood. “You will fly me back to the city now.”\nWhen they were airborne and pointed north, she said: “You fly exactly as Duncan Idaho did.”\nHe cast a speculative glance at her. “Others have told me this.”\n“What are you thinking now?” she asked.\n“Many things.”\n“Stop dodging my question, damn you!”\n“Which question?”\nShe glared at him.\nHe saw the glare, shrugged.\nHow like Duncan Idaho, that gesture, she thought. Accusingly, her voice thick and with a catch in it, she said: “l merely wanted your reactions voiced to play my own thoughts against them. That young woman’s death bothers me.”\n“I was not thinking about that.”\n“What were you thinking about?”\n“About the strange emotions | feel when people speak of the one | may have been.”\n“May have been?”\n“The Tleilaxu are very clever.”\n“Not that clever. You were Duncan Idaho.”\n“Very likely. It’s the prime computation.”\n“So you get emotional?”\n“To a degree. | feel eagerness. I’m uneasy. There’s a tendency to tremble and | must devote effort to controlling it. | get... flashes of imagery.”\n“What imagery?”\n“It’s too rapid to recognize. Flashes. Spasms... almost memories.”\n“Aren't you curious about such memories?”\n“Of course. Curiosity urges me forward, but | move against a heavy reluctance. | think: ‘What if I’m not the one they believe me to be?’ | don’t like that thought.”\n“And this is all you were thinking?”\n“You know better than that, Alia.”\nHow dare he use my given name? She felt anger rise and go down beneath the memory of the way he’d spoken: softly throbbing undertones, casual male confidence. A muscle twitched along her jaw. She clenched her teeth.\n“Isn't that El Kuds down there?” he asked, dipping a wing briefly, causing a sudden flurry in their escort.\nShe looked down at their shadows rippling across the promontory above Harg Pass, at the cliff and the rock pyramid containing the skull of her father. EI Kuds—the Holy Place.\n“That’s the Holy Place,” she said.\n“I must visit that place one day,” he said. “Nearness to your father’s remains may bring memories | can capture.”\nShe saw suddenly how strong must be this need to know who he’d been. It was a central compulsion with him. She looked back at the rocks, the cliff with its base sloping into a dry beach and a sea of sand—cinnamon rock lifting from the dunes like a ship breasting waves.\n“Circle back,” she said.\n“The escort...”\n“They'll follow. Swing under them.”\nHe obeyed.\n“Do you truly serve my brother?” she asked, when he was on the new course, the escort following.\n“I serve the Atreides,” he said, his tone formal.\nAnd she saw his right hand lift, fall—almost the old salute of Caladan. A pensive look came over his face. She watched him peer down at the rock pyramid.\n“What bothers you?” she asked.\nHis lips moved. A voice emerged, brittle, tight: “He was...hewas...” Atear slid down his cheek.\nAlia found herself stilled by Fremen awe. He gave water to the dead! Compulsively, she touched a finger to his cheek, felt the tear.\n“Duncan,” she whispered.\nHe appeared locked to the 'thopter’s controls, gaze fastened to the tomb below.\nShe raised her voice: “Duncan!”\nHe swallowed, shook his head, looked at her, the metal\neyes glistening. “I... felt... an arm... on my shoulders,” he whispered. “I felt it! An arm.” His throat worked. “It was...a friend. It was... my friend.”\n“Who?”\n“I don’t know. | think it was. .. | don’t know.”\nThe call light began flashing in front of Alia, their escort captain wanting to know why they returned to the desert. She took the microphone, explained that they had paid a brief homage to her father’s tomb. The captain reminded her that it was late.\n“We will go to Arrakeen now,” she said, replacing the microphone.\nHayt took a deep breath, banked their 'thopter around to the north.\n“It was my father’s arm you felt, wasn’t it?” she asked.\n“Perhaps.”\nHis voice was that of the mentat computing probabilities, and she saw he had regained his composure.\n“Are you aware of how | know my father?” she asked.\n“I have some idea.”\n“Let me make it clear,” she said. Briefly, she explained how she had awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before birth, a terrified fetus with the knowledge of countless lives embedded in her nerve cells—and all this after the death of her father.\n“I know my father as my mother knew him,” she said. “In every last detail of every experience she shared with him. In a way, | am my mother. | have all her memories up to the moment when she drank the Water of Life and entered the trance of transmigration.”\n“Your brother explained something of this.”\n“He did? Why?”\n“Į asked.”\n“Why?”\n“A mentat requires data.”\n“Oh.” She looked down at the flat expanse of the Shield Wall—tortured rock, pits and crevices.\nHe saw the direction of her gaze, said: “A very exposed place, that down there.”\n“But an easy place to hide,” she said. She looked at him. “It reminds me of ahuman mind... with all its concealments.”\n“Ahhh,” he said.\n“Ahhh? What does that mean—ahhh?” She was suddenly angry with him and the reason for it escaped her.\n“You'd like to Know what my mind conceals,” he said. It was a Statement, not a question.\n“How do you know | haven’t exposed you for what you are by my powers of prescience?” she demanded.\n“Have you?” He seemed genuinely curious.\n“No!”\n“Sibyls have limits,” he said.\nHe appeared to be amused and this reduced Alia’s anger. “Amused? Have you no respect for my powers?” she asked.\nThe question sounded weakly argumentative even to her own ears.\n“I respect your omens and portents perhaps more than you think,” he said. “I was in the audience for your Morning Ritual.”\n“And what does that signify?”\n“You’ve great ability with symbols,” he said, keeping his attention on the '’thopter’s controls. “That’s a Bene Gesserit thing, I'd say. But, as with many witches, you’ve become careless of your powers.”\nShe felt a spasm of fear, blared: “How dare you?”\n“|I dare much more than my makers anticipated,” he said. “Because of that rare fact, | remain with your brother.”\nAlia studied the steel balls which were his eyes: no human expression there. The stillsuit hood concealed the line of his jaw. His mouth remained firm, though. Great strength in it... and determination. His words had carried a reassuring intensity. “...dare much more...” That was a thing Duncan Idaho might have said. Had the Tleilaxu fashioned their ghola better than they knew—or was this mere sham, part of his conditioning?\n“Explain yourself, ghola,” she commanded.\n“Know thyself, is that thy commandment?” he asked. Again, she felt that he was amused. “Don’t bandy words with me, you... you thing!” she said. She put a hand to the crysknife in its throat sheath. “Why were you given to my\nbrother?”\n“Your brother tells me that you watched the presentation,” he said. “You’ve heard me answer that question for him.”\n“Answer it again... for me!”\n“I am intended to destroy him.”\n“Is that the mentat speaking?”\n“You know the answer to that without asking,” he chided. “And you know, as well, that such a gift wasn’t necessary.\nYour brother already was destroying himself quite adequately.”\nShe weighed these words, her hand remaining on the haft of her knife. A tricky answer, but there was sincerity in the voice.\n“Then why such a gift?” she probed.\n“It may have amused the Tleilaxu. And, it is true, that the Guild asked for me as a gift.”\n“Why?”\n“Same answer.”\n“How am | careless of my powers?”\n“How are you employing them?” he countered.\nHis question slashed through to her own misgivings. She took her hand away from the knife, asked: “Why do you say my brother was destroying himself?”\n“Oh, come now, child! Where are these vaunted powers? Have you no ability to reason?”\nControlling anger, she said: “Reason for me, mentat.”\n“Very well.” He glanced around at their escort, returned his attention to their course. The plain of Arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern rim of the Shield Wall. The pattern of the pan and graben villages remained indistinct beneath a dust pall, but the distant gleam of Arrakeen could be discerned.\n“Symptoms,” he said. “Your brother keeps an official Panegyrist who—”\n“Who was a gift of the Fremen Naibs!”\n“An", "?”\n“Same answer.”\n“How am | careless of my powers?”\n“How are you employing them?” he countered.\nHis question slashed through to her own misgivings. She took her hand away from the knife, asked: “Why do you say my brother was destroying himself?”\n“Oh, come now, child! Where are these vaunted powers? Have you no ability to reason?”\nControlling anger, she said: “Reason for me, mentat.”\n“Very well.” He glanced around at their escort, returned his attention to their course. The plain of Arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern rim of the Shield Wall. The pattern of the pan and graben villages remained indistinct beneath a dust pall, but the distant gleam of Arrakeen could be discerned.\n“Symptoms,” he said. “Your brother keeps an official Panegyrist who—”\n“Who was a gift of the Fremen Naibs!”\n“An odd gift from friends,” he said. “Why would they surround him with flattery and servility? Have you really listened to this Panegyrist? ‘The people are illuminated by Muad’Dib. The Umma Regent, our Emperor, came out of darkness to shine resplendently upon all men. He is our Sire. He is precious water from an endless fountain. He spills joy for all the universe to drink,’ Pah!”\nSpeaking softly, Alia said: “If | but repeated your words for our Fremen escort, they’d hack you into bird feed.”\n“Then tell them.”\n“My brother rules by the natural law of heaven!”\n“You don’t believe that, so why say it?”\n“How do you know what | believe?” She experienced trembling that no Bene Gesserit powers could control. This ghola was having an effect she hadn’t anticipated.\n“You commanded me to reason as a mentat,” he reminded her.\n“No mentat knows what | believe!” She took two deep, shuddering breaths. “How dare you judge us?”\n“Judge you? | don’t judge.”\n“You've no idea how we were taught!”\n“Both of you were taught to govern,” he said. “You were conditioned to an overweening thirst for power. You were imbued with a shrewd grasp of politics and a deep understanding for the uses of war and ritual. Natural law? What natural law? That myth haunts human history. Haunts! It’s a ghost. It’s insubstantial, unreal. Is your Jihad a natural law?”\n“Mentat jabber,” she sneered.\n“I’m a servant of the Atreides and | speak with candor,” he said.\n“Servant? We've no servants; only disciples.”\n“And | am a disciple of awareness,” he said. “Understand that, child, and you—”\n“Don’t call me child!” she snapped. She slipped her crysknife half out of its sheath.\n“| stand corrected.” He glanced at her, smiled, returned his attention to piloting the 'thopter. The cliffsided structure of the Atreides Keep could be made out now, dominating the northern suburbs of Arrakeen. “You are something ancient in flesh that is little more than a child,” he said. “And the flesh is disturbed by its new womanhood.”\n“I don’t know why | listen to you,” she growled, but she let the crysknife fall back into its sheath, wiped her palm on her robe. The palm, wet with perspiration, disturbed her\nsense of Fremen frugality. Such a waste of the body’s moisture!\n“You listen because you know I’m devoted to your brother,” he said. “My actions are clear and easily understood.”\n“Nothing about you is clear and easily understood. You’re the most complex creature I’ve ever seen. How do | know what the Tleilaxu built into you?”\n“By mistake or intent,” he said, “they gave me freedom to mold myself.”\n“You retreat into Zensunni parables,” she accused. “The wise man molds himself—the fool lives only to die.” Her voice was heavy with mimicry. “Disciple of awareness!”\n“Men cannot separate means and enlightenment,” he said.\n“You speak riddles!”\n“I speak to the opening mind.”\n“I’m going to repeat all this to Paul.”\n“He’s heard most of it already.”\nShe found herself overwhelmed by curiosity. “How is it you're still alive... and free? What did he say?”\n“He laughed. And he said, ‘People don’t want a bookkeeper for an Emperor; they want a master, someone who'll protect them from change.’ But he agreed that destruction of his Empire arises from himself.”\n“Why would he say such things?”\n“Because | convinced him | understand his problem and will help him.”\n“What could you possibly have said to do that?”\nHe remained silent, banking the ‘thopter into the downwind leg for a landing at the guard complex on the roof of the Keep.\n“| demand you tell me what you said!”\n“I’m not sure you could take it.”\n“I'll be the judge of that! | command you to speak at once!”\n“Permit me to land us first,” he said. And not waiting for her permission, he turned onto the base leg, brought the wings into optimum lift, settled gently onto the bright orange pad atop the roof.\n“Now,” Alia said. “Speak.”\n“I told him that to endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe.”\nShe shook her head. “That’s...that’s...”\n“A bitter pill,” he said, watching the guards run toward them across the roof, taking up their escort positions.\n“Bitter nonsense!”\n“The greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the same problem. You cannot hire a mentat or any other intellect to solve it for you. There’s no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No servant—or disciple—can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see.”\nShe whirled away from him, realizing in the instant of action what this betrayed about her own feelings. Without wile of voice or witch-wrought trickery, he had reached into her psyche once more. How did he do this?\n“What have you told him to do?” she whispered.\n“I told him to judge, to impose order.”\nAlia stared out at the guard, marking how patiently they waited—how orderly. “To dispense justice,” she murmured. “Not that!” he snapped. “I suggested that he judge, no\nmore, guided by one principle, perhaps...”\n“And that?”\n“To keep his friends and destroy his enemies.”\n“To judge unjustly, then.”\n“What is justice? Two forces collide. Each may have the right in his own sphere. And here’s where an Emperor commands orderly solutions. Those collisions he cannot prevent—he solves.”\n“How?”\n“In the simplest way: he decides.”\n“Keeping his friends and destroying his enemies.”\n“Isn't that stability? People want order, this kind or some other. They sit in the prison of their hungers and see that war has become the sport of the rich. That’s a dangerous form of sophistication. It’s disorderly.”\n“I will suggest to my brother that you are much too dangerous and must be destroyed,” she said, turning to face him.\n“A solution I’ve already suggested,” he said.\n“And that’s why you are dangerous,” she said, measuring out her words. “You’ve mastered your passions.”\n“That is not why I’m dangerous.” Before she could move, he leaned across, gripped her chin in one hand, planted his lips on hers.\nIt was a gentle kiss, brief. He pulled away and she stared at him with a shock leavened by glimpses of spasmodic grins on the faces of her guardsmen still standing at orderly attention outside.\nAlia put a finger to her lips. There’d been such a sense of familiarity about that kiss. His lips had been flesh of a future she’d seen in some prescient byway. Breast heaving, she said: “I should have you flayed.”\n“Because I’m dangerous?”\n“Because you presume too much!”\n“| presume nothing. | take nothing which is not first offered to me. Be glad | did not take all that was offered.” He opened his door, slid out. “Come along. We've dallied too long on a fool’s errand.” He strode toward the entrance dome beyond the pad.\nAlia leaped out, ran to match his stride. “lII tell him everything you've said and everything you did,” she said.\n“Good.” He held the door for her.\n“He will order you executed,” she said, slipping into the dome.\n“Why? Because | took the kiss | wanted?” He followed her, his movement forcing her back. The door slid closed behind\nhim.\n“The kiss you wanted!” Outrage filled her.\n“All right, Alia. The kiss you wanted, then.” He started to move around her toward the drop field.\nAs though his movement had propelled her into heightened awareness, she realized his candor—the utter truthfulness of him. The kiss I wanted, she told herself. True.\n“Your truthfulness, that’s what’s dangerous,” she said, following him.\n“You return to the ways of wisdom,” he said, not breaking his stride. “A mentat could not’ve stated the matter more directly. Now: what is it you saw in the desert?”\nShe grabbed his arm, forcing him to a halt. He’d done it again: shocked her mind into sharpened awareness.\n“I can’t explain it,” she said, “but | keep thinking of the Face Dancers. Why is that?”\n“That is why your brother sent you to the desert,” he said, nodding. “Tell him of this persistent thought.”\n“But why?” She shook her head. “Why Face Dancers?”\n“There’s a young woman dead out there,” he said. “Perhaps no young woman is reported missing among the Fremen.”\n| think what a joy it is to be alive, and | wonder if l'Il ever leap inward to the root of this flesh and know myself as once | was. The root is there. Whether any act of mine can find it, that remains tangled in the future. But all things a man can do are mine. Any act of mine may do it.\n—THE GHOLA SPEAKS ALIA’S COMMENTARY\nA? he lay immersed in the screaming odor of the spice, staring inward through the oracular trance, Paul saw the moon become an elongated sphere. It rolled and twisted, hissing—the terrible hissing of a star being quenched in an infinite sea—down...down... down... like a ball thrown by a child.\nIt was gone.\nThis moon had not set. Realization engulfed him. It was gone: no moon. The earth quaked like an animal shaking its Skin. Terror swept over him.\nPaul jerked upright on his pallet, eyes wide open, staring. Part of him looked outward, part inward. Outwardly, he saw the plasmeld grillwork which vented his private room, and he knew he lay beside a stonelike abyss of his Keep. Inwardly, he continued to see the moon fall.\nOut! Out!\nHis grillwork of plasmeld looked onto the blazing light of noon across Arrakeen. Inward—there lay blackest night. A shower of sweet odors from a garden roof nibbled at his senses, but no floral perfume could roll back that fallen moon.\nPaul swung his feet to the cold surface of the floor, peered through the grillwork. He could see directly across to the gentle arc of a footbridge constructed of crystal- stabilized gold and platinum. Fire jewels from far Cedon\ndecorated the bridge.
