He became the first emperor of the state of Cao Wei, a position he attained through a series of political maneuvers and military campaigns aimed at consolidating power and expanding his territory.\n\nCao Pi's ascension to the throne was marked by a notable abdication ceremony at the Shouchan Altar (受禅坛), where he officially took over the leadership of Wei. His reign was characterized by his efforts to usurp the Han dynasty, positioning himself as a central figure in the power struggles that defined the era. As the ruler of Wei, he was involved in various political intrigues and military confrontations, particularly against rival states such as Shu Han and Eastern Wu.\n\nThroughout his rule, Cao Pi was recognized not only for his political acumen but also for his military strategies. He planned multiple campaigns against Shu Han, seeking to expand Wei's influence and territory. His leadership style and decisions made him a central antagonist in the ongoing conflicts of the Three Kingdoms, as he navigated alliances and rivalries, including potential collaborations with figures like Meng Da.\n\nCao Pi's legacy is intertwined with the historical narrative of the Three Kingdoms, where he is remembered as a key player in the transition from the Han dynasty to the era of the Three Kingdoms, shaping the political landscape of his time through both his governance and military endeavors.\",29\n2365,黄龙,\"The 黄龙, or yellow dragon, is a significant symbol in Chinese history, particularly during the tumultuous Three Kingdoms period. Its appearance is regarded as a divine omen, heralding the transition of power from the Han dynasty to the Wei kingdom.

The dragon is often associated with auspiciousness and imperial authority in Chinese culture, and its appearance was seen as a divine endorsement of the new regime. This interpretation underscores the significance of celestial signs in legitimizing political power and the belief in the mandate of heaven, which was a prevalent concept in Chinese political philosophy.\n\nIn summary, the 黄龙 symbolizes a pivotal moment in the history of the Three Kingdoms, representing the divine support for the Wei dynasty's rise to power following the decline of the Han dynasty.
