Waff felt dislocated, though, and at a disadvantage. What if the stories of his informants were true? She must have weapons here.\nShe smiled at him without humor.\n“You are trying to intimidate me,” Waff said.\n“And succeeding.” Anger surged through Waff. He kept this from his voice. “I have come at your invitation.”\n“I hope you did not come to engage in a confrontation that you would surely lose,” she said.\n“I came to forge a bond between us,” he said. And he wondered: What do they need from us? Surely they must need something.\n“What bond can there be between us?” she asked. “Would you build an edifice on a disintegrating raft? Hah! Agreements can be broken and often are.”\n“For what tokens do we bargain?” he asked.\n“Bargain? | do not bargain. | am interested in this ghola you made for the witches.” Her tone gave away nothing but Waff’s heartbeat quickened at her question.\nIn one of his ghola lifetimes, Waff had trained under a renegade Mentat. The capabilities of a Mentat were beyond him and besides, reasoning required words. They had been forced to kill the powindah Mentat but there had been some things of value in the experience. Waff allowed himself a small moue of distaste at the memory but he recalled the things of value.\nAttack and absorb the data that attack produces!\n“You offer me nothing in exchange!” he said, his voice loud.\n“Recompense is at my discretion,” she said.\nWaff produced a scornful gaze. “Do you play with me?”\nShe showed white teeth in a feral grin. “You would not Survive my play, nor want to.”\n“So | must be dependent upon your good will!”\n“Dependency!” The word curled from her mouth as though it produced a distasteful sensation. “Why do you sell these gholas to the witches and then kill the gholas?”\nWaff pressed his lips together and remained silent.\n“You have somehow changed this ghola while still making it possible for him to regain his original memories,” she said. “You know so much!” Waff said. It was not quite a sneer\nand, he hoped, revealed nothing. Spies! She had spies among the witches! Was there also a traitor in the Tleilaxu heartlands?\n“There is a girl-child on Rakis who figures in the plans of the witches,” the Honored Matre said.\n“How do you know this?”\n“The witches do not make a move without our knowing! You think of spies but you cannot know how far our arms will reach!”\nWaff was dismayed. Could she read his mind? Was it something born of the Scattering? A wild talent from out there where the original human seed could not observe?\n“How have you changed this ghola?” she demanded.\nVoice!\nWaff, armed against such devices by his Mentat teacher, almost blurted an answer. This Honored Matre had some of the witches’ powers! It had been so unexpected coming from her. You expected such things from a Reverend Mother and were prepared. He was a moment recovering his balance. Waff steepled his hands in front of his chin.\n“You have interesting resources,” she said.\nA gamin expression came over Waff’s features. He knew how disarmingly elflike he could look.\nAttack!\n“We know how much you have learned from the Bene Gesserit,” he said.\nA look of rage swept over her face and was gone. “They have taught us nothing!”\nWaff pitched his voice at a humorously appealing level, cajoling. “Surely, this is not bargaining.”\n“Isn't it?” She actually appeared surprised.\nWaff lowered his hands. “Come now, Honored Matre. You are interested in this ghola. You speak of things on Rakis. What do you take us for?”\n“Very little. You become less valuable by the instant.”\nWaff sensed the coldest machine logic in her response. There was no smell of Mentat in it but something more chilling. She is capable of killing me right here!\nWhere were her weapons? Would she even require weapons? He did not like the look of those stringy muscles, the calluses on her hands, the hunter’s gleam in her orange eyes. Could she possibly guess (or even know) about the dart throwers in his sleeves?\n“We are confronted by a problem that cannot be resolved by logical means,” she said.\nWaff stared at her in shock. A Zensunni Master might have said that! He had said it himself on more than one occasion.\n“You have probably never considered such a possibility,” she said. It was as though her words dropped a mask away from her face. Waff suddenly saw through to the calculating person behind these postures. Did she take him for some padfooted seelie fit only for collecting slig shit?\nBringing as much hesitant puzzlement into his voice as possible, he asked: “How could such a problem be resolved?”\n“The natural course of events will dispose of it,” she said.\nWaff continued to stare at her in simulated puzzlement. Her words did not smack of revelation. Still, the things implied! He said: “Your words leave me floundering.”\n“Humankind has become infinite,” she said. “That is the true gift of the Scattering.”\nWaff fought to conceal the turmoil these words created. “Infinite universes, infinite time—anything may happen,” he\nsaid.\n“Ahhh, you are a bright little manikin,” she said. “How does one allow for anything? It is not logical.”\nShe sounded, Waff thought, like one of the ancient leaders of the Butlerian Jihad, which had tried to rid humankind of mechanical minds. This Honored Matre was strangely out of date.\n“Our ancestors looked for an answer with computers,” he ventured. Let her try that!\n“You already know that computers lack infinite storage Capacity,” she said.\nAgain, her words disconcerted him. Could she actually read minds? Was this a form of mind-printing? What the Tleilaxu did with Face Dancers and gholas, others might do as well. He centered his awareness and concentrated on Ixians, on their evil machines. Powindah machines!\nThe Honored Matre swept her gaze around the room. “Are we wrong to trust the Ixians?” she asked.\nWaff held his breath.\n“I don’t think you fully trust them,” she said. “Come, come, little man. | offer you my good will.”\nBelatedly, Waff began to suspect that she was trying to be friendly and candid with him. She certainly had put aside her earlier pose of angry superiority. Waff’s informants from the Lost Ones said the Honored Matres made sexual decisions much in the manner of the Bene Gesserit. Was she trying to be seductive? But she clearly understood and had exposed the weakness of logic.\nIt was very confusing!\n“We are talking in circles,” he said.\n“Quite the contrary. Circles enclose. Circles limit. Humankind no longer is limited by the space in which to grow.”\nThere she went again! He spoke past a dry tongue: “It is said that what you cannot control you must accept.”\nShe leaned forward, the orange eyes intent on his face. “Do you accept the possibility of a final disaster for the Bene Tleilax?”\n“If that were the case | would not be here.”\n“When logic fails, another tool must be used.”\nWaff grinned. “That sounds logical.”\n“Don’t mock me! How dare you!”\nWaff lifted his hands defensively and assumed a placating tone: “What tool would the Honored Matre suggest?”\n“Energy!”\nHer answer surprised him. “Energy? In what form and how much?”\n“You demand logical answers,” she said.\nWith a feeling of sadness, Waff realized that she was not, after all, Zensunni. The Honored Matre only played word games on the fringes of non-logic, circling it, but her tool was logic.\n“Rot at the core spreads outward,” he said.\nIt was as though she had not heard his testing statement. “There is untapped energy in the depths of any human we deign to touch,” she said. She extended a skeletal finger to within a few millimeters of his nose.\nWaff pulled back into his chair until she dropped her arm. He said: “Is that not what the Bene Gesserit said before producing their Kwisatz Haderach?”\n“They lost control of themselves and of him,” she sneered.\nAgain, Waff thought, she employed logic in thinking of the non-logical. How much she had told him in these little lapses. He could glimpse the probable history of these Honored Matres. One of the natura/ Reverend Mothers from the Fremen of Rakis had gone out in the Scattering. Diverse people had fled on the no-ships during and immediately after the Famine Times. A no-ship had seeded the wild witch and her concepts somewhere. That seed had returned in the form of this orange-eyed huntress.\nOnce more she hurled Voice at him, demanding: “What have you wrought with this ghola?”\nThis time, Waff was prepared and shrugged it off. This Honored Matre would have to be deflected or, if possible, Slain. He had learned much from her but there was no way of telling how much she had learned from him with her unguessed talents.\nThey are sexual monsters, his informants had said. They enslave men by the powers of sex.\n“How little you know the joys | could give you,” she said. Her voice coiled like a whip around him. How tempting! How seductive!\nWaff spoke defensively: “Tell me why you—”\n“I need tell you nothing!”\n“Then you did not come to bargain.” He spoke sadly. The no-ships had, indeed, seeded those other universes with rot. Waff sensed the weight of necessity on his shoulders. What if he could not slay her?\n“How dare you keep suggesting a bargain with an Honored Matre?” she demanded. “Know you that we set the price!”\n“I do not Know your ways, Honored Matre,” Waff said. “But | sense in your words that | have offended.”\n“Apology accepted.”\nNo apology intended! He stared at her blandly. Many things could be deduced from her performance. Out of his millennial experiences, Waff reviewed what he had learned here. This female from the Scattering came to him for an essential piece of information. Therefore, she had no other source. He sensed desperation in her. Well masked but definitely there. She needed confirmation or refutation of something she feared.\nHow like a predatory bird she was, sitting there with her claw hands so lightly on the arms of her chair! Rot at the core spreads outward. He had said it and she had not heard.
