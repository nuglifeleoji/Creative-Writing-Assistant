\n　　想想也是，孙少安摆开这么大的战场，而且想弄出点名堂，那也就少不了他后生的苦恼。是的，他的确为他的事业苦恼——但更苦恼的倒还不仅仅是这些事！ \n　　前几天从县城返回村子后，尽管他一如既往紧张地投入到砖厂的忙乱之中，但心情一直感到很沉重。妹妹那双泪蒙蒙的眼睛不时浮现在他眼前。他在砖厂一边干活，一边难受地咽着吐沫。他明白妹妹为什么不要他的钱。懂事的兰香心疼他，体谅他，怕秀莲和他闹架。唉，几年前他怎么也不会想到出现这样的情况。光景好转了，可家庭却四分五裂！但话说回来，他又怎能全部埋怨他的秀莲呢？ \n　　自进这个家门来，她没少吃过苦哇！现在，她又熬死累活帮扶他支撑这个大摊场，家里和砖厂两头忙，手上经常裂着血口子……虽然她坚持分了家，但按乡俗说，对待老人也无可挑剔。平时，这面家里做点好吃喝，她总想着给那面的三个老人端过去一些。天冷的时候，母亲眼睛不好了，她就熬夜把老人们的棉衣棉裤都拆洗的干干净净。就是他给老人量盐买油，她也从不说什么。只是他要把一笔大点数目的钱拿出来给家里的人，她就有些不高兴了——钱是她管着的，分分厘厘的花费都瞒不了她……少安思来想去，觉得分家以后，是他自己对家里的人没尽到责任。办法总应该是有的；但他忙于自己的事，没有对亲人们的处境经心关照过。 \n　　怎么办呢？偷着给他们一点零碎钱，也起不了大作用，反而还得和老婆磨牙拌嘴……少安在他的砖厂一边起劲地干活，一边焦虑地思谋着。 \n　　后来，他突然想：最好还是说服少平回来和他一块办砖厂！是呀，他掏大钱雇用两旁世人哩，为什么让弟弟流落在外边赚人家的下眼钱？少平受死受活，一月又能赚多少？如果弟弟回来和他一块办这砖厂，他们两个合伙操持，赚得红利一分为二，两家就都能有个大翻身。要是这样，秀莲也就无话可说。他相信他能说服妻子。这是一个最根本的解决办法，而这样他们实际上又成了一家人！ \n　　好！早应该这样办了。 \n　　孙少安想到这里的时候，停止了干活，赶忙卷起了一支旱烟棒。他开始深入考虑怎样实施这个计划。他越想越兴奋。弟弟文化程度高，说不定很快就能独立操持制砖机，不用再掏大工钱雇这位河南师傅了。弟兄俩一个照料砖厂，一个\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
