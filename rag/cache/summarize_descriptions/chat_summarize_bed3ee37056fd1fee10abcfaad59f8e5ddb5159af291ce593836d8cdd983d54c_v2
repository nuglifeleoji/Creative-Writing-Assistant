Once the ruling house of the Known Universe, they rose to power after the Battle of Corrin and reigned as the imperial dynasty until their deposition by Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides). Now exiled, House Corrino actively schemes to reclaim its former dominance through political intrigue, strategic alliances, and military machinations.  \n\nCurrently led by **Farad’n**, the house is represented by key figures such as Princess Wensicia, who orchestrate plots against their rivals, particularly **House Atreides**. The Corrinos harbor deep-seated enmity toward the Atreides, viewing them as usurpers and threats to their restoration. Their ambitions include eliminating perceived dangers, such as the Atreides twins, Leto and Ghanima, whom they have targeted in past conspiracies.  \n\nHouse Corrino employs a range of tactics, from bribery and diplomacy to overt aggression, to regain influence. They have courted controversy by offering gifts to Alia and the twins, raising suspicions within the Imperial Council. Farad’n, as the face of the house, embodies its aspirations, leveraging his lineage and political acumen to advance their cause.  \n\nDespite their diminished status, the Corrinos remain a formidable faction, wielding religious and political influence. Their historical claims to power, combined with persistent scheming, position them as enduring adversaries in the Imperium’s power struggles. Whether through alliances or force, House Corrino seeks to restore its ancient glory, making them a persistent threat to the current order.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251786, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 797, "total_tokens": 1132, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 733}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
