But what if it were not Fondak? What if the tabu still ruled and this were only the shell of ghostly Jacurutu?\nLeto crouched in the lee of his dune and waited for the night to settle into its own rhythms. Patience and caution— caution and patience. For a time he amused himself by reviewing Chaucer’s route from London to Canterbury, listing the places from Southwark: two miles to the watering-place of St. Thomas, five miles to Deptford, six miles to Greenwich, thirty miles to Rochester, forty miles to Sittingbourne, fifty-five miles to Boughton under Blean, fifty- eight miles to Harbledown, and sixty miles to Canterbury. It gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall Chaucer or know any London except the village on Gansireed. St. Thomas was preserved in the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar Book, but Canterbury was gone from the memories of men, as was the planet which had known it. There lay the burden of his memories, of all those lives which threatened to engulf him. He had made that trip to Canterbury once.\nHis present trip was longer, though, and more dangerous.\nPresently he crept over the dune’s crest and made his way toward the moonlit rocks. He blended with shadows, slid across the crests, made no sounds that might signal his presence.\nThe dust had gone as it often did just before a storm, and the night was brilliant. The day had revealed no movement, but he heard small creatures hustling in the darkness as he neared the rocks.\nIn a valley between two dunes he came upon a family of jerboa which scampered away at his approach. He eased over the next crest, his emotions beset by salty anxieties. That cleft he had seen—did it lead up to an entrance? And there were other concerns: the old-time sietch had always been guarded by traps—poisoned barbs in pits, poisoned spines on plants. He felt himself caught up in the Fremen agrapha: The earminded night. And he listened for the Slightest sound.\nThe grey rocks towered above him now, made giant by his nearness. As he listened, he heard birds invisible in that cliff, the soft calling of winged prey. They were the sounds of daybirds, but abroad by night. What had turned their world around? Human predation?\nAbruptly Leto froze against the sand. There was fire on the cliff, a ballet of glittering and mysterious gems against the night’s black gauze, the sort of signal a sietch might send to wanderers across the bled. Who were these occupants of this place? He crept forward into the deepest shadows at the cliff’s base, felt along the rock with a hand, Sliding his body behind the hand as he sought the fissure he’d seen by daylight. He located it on his eighth step, slipped the sandsnorkel from his kit and probed the darkness. As he moved, something tight and binding dropped over his shoulders and arms, immobilizing him.\nTrapvine!\nHe resisted the urge to struggle; that only made the vine pull tighter. He dropped the snorkel, flexed the fingers of his right hand, trying for the knife at his waist. He felt like a bare innocent for not throwing something into that fissure from a distance, testing the darkness for its dangers. His mind had been too occupied by the fire on the cliff.\nEach movement tightened the trapvine, but his fingers at last touched the knife hilt. Stealthily, he closed his hand around the hilt, began to slip it free.\nFlaring light enveloped him, arresting all movement.\n“Ahhh, a fine catch in our net.” It was a heavy masculine voice from behind Leto, something vaguely familiar in the tone. Leto tried to turn his head, aware of the vine’s dangerous propensity to crush a body which moved too freely.\nA hand took his knife before he could see his captor. The hand moved expertly over his body, extracting the small devices he and Ghanima carried as a matter of survival. Nothing escaped the searcher, not even the shigawire garrote concealed in his hair.\nLeto still had not seen the man.\nFingers did something with the trapvine and he found he could breathe easier, but the man said: “Do not struggle, Leto Atreides. | have your water in my cup.”\nBy supreme effort Leto remained calm, said: “You know my name?”\n“Of course! When one baits a trap, it’s for a purpose. One aims for a specific quarry, not so?”\nLeto remained silent, but his thoughts whirled.\n“You feel betrayed!” the heavy voice said. Hands turned him around, gently but with an obvious show of strength. An adult male was telling the child what the odds were.\nLeto stared up into the glare from twin floater flares, saw the black outline of a stillsuit-masked face, the hood. As his eyes adjusted he made out a dark strip of skin, the utterly shadowed eyes of melange addiction.\n“You wonder why we went to all this trouble,” the man said. His voice issued from the shielded lower part of his face with a curious muffled quality, as though he tried to conceal an accent.\n“| long ago ceased to wonder at the numbers of people who want the Atreides twins dead,” Leto said. “Their reasons are obvious.”\nAs he spoke, Leto’s mind flung itself against the unknown as against a cage, questing wildly for answers. A baited trap? But who had known except Ghanima? Impossible!\nGhanima wouldn’t betray her own brother. Then did someone know him well enough to predict his actions? Who? His grandmother? How could she?\n“You could not be permitted to go on as you were,” the man said. “Very bad. Before ascending the throne, you need to be educated.” The whiteless eyes stared down at him. “You wonder how one could presume to educate such a person as yourself? You, with the knowledge of a multitude held there in your memories? That’s just it, you see! You think yourself educated, but all you are is a repository of dead lives. You don’t yet have a life of your own. You're just a walking surfeit of others, all with one goal—to seek death. Not good in a ruler, being a death seeker. You’d strew your Surroundings with corpses. Your father, for example, never understood the—”\n“You dare speak of him that way?”\n“Many’s the time I’ve dared it. He was only Paul Atreides, after all. Well, boy, welcome to your school.”\nThe man brought a hand from beneath his robe, touched Leto’s cheek. Leto felt the jolt of a slapshot and found himself winding downward into a darkness where a green flag waved. It was the green banner of the Atreides with its day and night symbols, its Dune staff which concealed a water tube. He heard the water gurgling as unconsciousness enfolded him. Or was it someone chuckling?\nWe can still remember the golden days before Heisenberg, who showed\nhumans the walls enclosing our predestined arguments. The lives within me find this amusing. Knowledge, you see, has no uses without purpose, but purpose is what builds enclosing walls.\n—LETO ATREIDES II HIS VOICE\nlia found herself speaking harshly to the guards she\nconfronted in the Temple foyer. There were nine of them in the dusty green uniforms of the suburban patrol, and they were still panting and sweating with their exertions. The light of late afternoon came in the door behind them. The area had been cleared of pilgrims.\n“So my orders mean nothing to you?” she demanded.\nAnd she wondered at her own anger, not trying to contain it but letting it run. Her body trembled with unleashed tensions. Idaho gone... the Lady Jessica...noreports... only rumors that they were on Salusa. Why hadn’t Idaho sent a message? What had he done? Had he learned finally about Javid?\nAlia wore the yellow of Arrakeen mourning, the color of the burning sun from Fremen history. In a few minutes she would be leading the second and final funeral procession to Old Gap, there to complete the stone marker for her lost nephew. The work would be completed in the night, fitting homage to one who'd been destined to lead Fremen.\nThe priestly guards appeared defiant in the face of her anger, not shamed at all. They stood in front of her, outlined by the waning light. The odor of their perspiration was easily detected through the light and inefficient stillsuits of city dwellers. Their leader, a tall blond Kaza with the bourka\nsymbols of the Cadelam family, flung his stillsuit mask aside to speak more clearly. His voice was full of the prideful intonations to be expected from a scion of the family which once had ruled at Sietch Abbir.\n“Certainly we tried to capture him!”\nThe man was obviously outraged at her attack. “He speaks blasohemy! We know your orders, but we heard him with our own ears!”\n“And you failed to catch him,” Alia said, her voice low and accusing.\nOne of the other guards, a short young woman, tried to defend them. “The crowds were thick there! | swear people interfered with us!”\n“We'll keep after him,” the Cadelam said. “We’ll not always fail.”\nAlia scowled. “Why won’t you understand and obey me?”\n“My Lady, we—”\n“What will you do, scion of the Cade Lamb, if you capture him and find him to be, in truth, my brother?”\nHe obviously did not hear her special emphasis on his name, although he could not be a priestly guard without some education and the wit to go with it. Did he want to sacrifice himself?\nThe guardsman swallowed, then: “We must kill him ourselves, for he breeds disorder.”\nThe others stood aghast at this, but still defiant. They knew what they had heard.\n“He calls upon the tribes to band against you,” the Cadelam said.\nAlia knew how to handle him now. She spoke in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone: “I see. Then if you must sacrifice yourself this way, taking him openly for all to see who you are and what you do, then | guess you must.”\n“Sacrifice my...” He broke off, glanced at his companions. As Kaza of this group, their appointed leader, he had the right to speak for them, but he showed signs\nthat he wished he’d remained silent. The other guards stirred uncomfortably. In the heat of the chase they’d defied Alia. One could only reflect now upon such defiance of the “Womb of Heaven.” With obvious discomfort the guards opened a small space between themselves and their Kaza.\n“For the good of the Church, our official reaction would have to be severe,” Alia said. “You understand that, don’t you?”\n“But he—”\n“I’ve heard him myself,” she said. “But this is a special case.”\n“He cannot be Muad’Dib, My Lady!”\nHow little you know! she thought. She said: “We cannot risk taking him in the open, harming him where others could see it. If another opportunity presents itself, of course.”\n“He’s always surrounded by crowds these days!”\n“Then | fear you must be patient. Of course, if you insist on defying me... .” She left the consequences hanging in the air, unspoken, but well understood. The Cadelam was ambitious, a shining career before him.\n“We didn’t mean defiance, My Lady.” The\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FONDAK<|>GEO<|>Fondak is a place mentioned in the text, possibly a location with historical or cultural significance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACURUTU<|>GEO<|>Jacurutu is referred to as a ghostly shell, possibly a place of legend or historical importance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO ATREIDES<|>PERSON<|>Leto Atreides is a central character, the son of Paul Atreides, with inherited memories and a significant role in the narrative.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTOPHER CHAUCER<|>PERSON<|>Chaucer is referenced in the text for his historical route from London to Canterbury, indicating his cultural or historical significance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHWARK<|>GEO<|>Southwark is mentioned as the starting point of Chaucer's route, a place of historical importance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST.
