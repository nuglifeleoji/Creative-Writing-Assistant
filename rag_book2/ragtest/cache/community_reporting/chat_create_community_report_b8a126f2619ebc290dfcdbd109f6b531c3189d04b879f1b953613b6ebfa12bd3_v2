He is primarily known for his work on cases involving **唐泽雪穗 (Karasawa Yukiho)** and **桐原亮司 (Kirihara Ryōji)**, often hired by **筱冢一成 (Shinozuka Kazunari)** to investigate Yukiho's background, past activities, and financial dealings.  \n\n今枝 is described as resourceful and methodical, adept at leveraging timing for surveillance, as seen when he assisted **菅原绘里 (Sugawara Eri)** in discovering a wiretap in her apartment, suspecting he himself was the target. He also interviewed witnesses like **元冈邦子 (Motooka Kuniko)** and collaborated with retired Osaka detective **笹垣 (Sasagaki)** to uncover connections between Yukiho, her adoptive mother **西本太太 (Nishimoto)**, and a past homicide.  \n\nHowever, his investigations into Yukiho and Ryōji's relationship, as well as **高宫诚 (Takamiya Makoto)** and **三泽千都留 (Misawa Chizuru)'s** affair, led to his mysterious disappearance, with some sources suggesting he may have met with foul play. Prior to this, he was hospitalized and unable to work, though the circumstances remain unclear.  \n\n今枝 operated under aliases, posing as a freelance journalist during interviews, and frequently employed Eri as an assistant to maintain cover. His meetings with Kazunari often took place in cafés, where he shared findings about Yukiho’s dubious history. Despite contradictions in his status (hospitalized vs. missing), the prevailing narrative indicates his disappearance was linked to his probing of Yukiho’s secrets.  \n\nIn summary, 今枝 was a skilled but ill-fated investigator whose work entangled him in a dangerous web surrounding Yukiho, culminating in his abrupt and unresolved exit from the case.\",34\n616,服装店,唐泽雪穗经营的服装店，店内摆满了各式女装、饰品，提供一流的商品和服务。,4\n633,筱冢先生,筱冢先生是今枝的联系人，提供了一些调查所需的联络方式,1\n643,万宝路,万宝路是香烟品牌，文中提到今枝抽万宝路香烟,1\n652,涩谷,今枝进行监视工作的地点,1\n670,益田均,益田均是今枝的前同事，现在在一家公司工作，心情不太好,1\n716,派报中心,\"负责报纸派发的机构，曾接到关于今枝失踪的可疑电话\"\"\",1\n767,川上,\"A woman who previously hired Mr. Imashigi to investigate her husband's infidelity and returned for another investigation\nA woman who previously hired Imashigi to investigate her husband's infidelity\",1\n654,窃听器,\"窃听器被安装在绘里的电话中，目的是监听她的通话，可能是为了获取她的人际关系信息。\"\"\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n925,今枝,东西电装株式会社,今枝曾调查东西电装株式会社怀疑Memorix窃取其技术的事件,44\n981,今枝,服装店,今枝带菅原绘里到唐泽雪穗的服装店选购衣服。,38\n1015,今枝,筱冢先生,今枝联系筱冢先生获取调查所需的联络方式,35\n1027,今枝,万宝路,今枝抽万宝路香烟,35\n1046,今枝,涩谷,今枝在涩谷进行监视工作,35\n1087,今枝,益田均,今枝向益田均索要公司资料，益田均对此表示不满,35\n1185,今枝,派报中心,有人冒充今枝联系派报中心停止送报，掩盖其失踪,35\n1268,川上,今枝,Kawakami hired Imashigi to investigate her husband's infidelity,35\n1048,绘里,窃听器,绘里的电话被安装了窃听器，她对此感到不安,13\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
