顶之灾。\n　　贝纳打来电话，告诉他日本首相要过一会儿才能来。戴维使自己平静了一下，开始回忆起大人们的历史。\n　　对于这个突然到来的新世纪，很难从上几个世纪的历史中得到什么直接的经验，但历史的启发总是有的。美国的顶峰是上次世界大战结束的时侯。在那次世界大战中美国成功的关键在于：利用大西洋和太平洋这两个难以逾越的天然屏障，使本土远离战争，使国家经济免遭战火破坏，并以这个强大的国家经济体系为后盾，在大洋对面的遥远战场上火中取粟。二次大战中，苏联伤亡人员达两千万，美国却只有区区四十五万；欧洲和亚洲在战火中变成一片废墟，而美国本土却远离各大战场，唯一能记起的直接战争破坏就是一艘航过广阔太平洋的胆大包天的日本潜艇向旧金山打了几炮，再就是几个从遥远的大洋对面顺风飘过来的日本妇女和孩子糊的纸气球，气球下面吊着燃烧弹，想引燃美国的森林。正因为如此，战争刚刚结束时的美国是唯一一个保留了完整的现代化工业体系的大国，这使它成为当时的世界宪兵，而照戴维的想法，如果那时罗斯福用另一场世界大战代替雅尔塔会议，一鼓作气把红色东方收拾掉，现在世界已经是美国的了。\n　　戴维现在已经明确了他要发动的战争有以下三个特点：\n　　一、快：首先是迅速发动，现在，世界刚从休克中苏醒，每个国家都处于摇摇晃晃立足未稳的状态，轻轻推一下就会重新倒下，根本经受不了一次大规模闪击战。另一方面，世界目前正处于迅速恢复的阶段，这不只是经济上的恢复，各国孩子们正在以前所未有的速度学习，严酷的现实将使他们的政治组织经验和军事组织经验迅速积累起来，他们每分钟都变得比上一分钟更老练更坚强更难对付。所以必须抓住时机，万万不可犹豫不决。从自身来说，即使是美国，现在也经不起半年以上的战争的消耗。\n　　二、狠：必须彻底摧毁战争目标的国家政治结构和经济结构，不择一切手段扑灭可能出现的抵抗，使其至少在半个世纪内无法恢复过来。\n　　三、也是最重要的一点：隔岸放火，使美国本土远离战争，不能让战火烧伤自己。\n　　戴维懊丧地发现，目前仅靠美国自身是难以实现以上计划的。不错，以前美国称雄世界，固然依靠它雄厚的国力，依靠它的钢铁，它的坦克飞机和超级舰队，但同时，也依靠一支高质量的军队。现在，美国还能在短时间内重建这样一支军队吗？戴维认为可能性不大。\n######################\nOutput:",
