He is deeply involved in Paul Atreides' education, acting as both a teacher and mentor, and even gifts him an ancient Orange Catholic Bible—a gesture that hints at his inner turmoil. Despite his apparent loyalty, Yueh harbors hidden tensions and is suspected of betrayal, particularly due to his involvement in discussions about spice and the Harkonnens.  \n\nYueh's betrayal is driven by coercion rather than malice: the Harkonnens have captured his wife, forcing him to act against the Atreides. He drugs Duke Leto and implants a poison tooth in his mouth, leading to the Duke’s death, while also facilitating the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis. However, his motives remain ambiguous, as he simultaneously arranges for Paul and Jessica to escape, displaying lingering loyalty and guilt. Though he is widely perceived as a traitor responsible for the fall of House Atreides, his actions are marked by desperation rather than outright treachery.  \n\nYueh’s character is defined by contradiction—he is both a healer and a betrayer, a trusted ally and a reluctant conspirator. His interactions with Idaho and Jessica reveal moments of genuine concern, complicating his role in the Atreides' downfall. Ultimately, Yueh’s betrayal is a tragic act of coercion, underscoring the brutal pressures of the Harkonnen-Atreides conflict.\",19\n238,BETRAYAL OF THE ATREIDES,\"The orchestrated downfall of House Atreides through Yueh's treachery and Harkonnen military action.\"\"\",2\n229,HIGH COLLEGE,\"The High College is referenced as the institution that conditioned Dr. Yueh, implying a medical or scientific authority>\",1\n244,SUK DOCTOR,\"The **SUK DOCTOR** is a prestigious medical order renowned for its rigorous training and ancient traditions, to which individuals like Yueh belong.

This conditioning is so deeply ingrained that it is widely believed to make SUK doctors immune to subversion, ensuring unwavering loyalty to their patients.  \n\nDespite this reputation, **Dr. Yueh’s betrayal** stands as a shocking anomaly, as his actions contradict the school’s foundational principles. His compromise suggests that even Imperial Conditioning may have limits, though such breaches are exceedingly rare. The SUK SCHOOL’s doctors are highly sought after by the elite, not only for their medical expertise but also for their perceived incorruptibility, making their services expensive and exclusive.  \n\nThe school’s influence is further symbolized by **Yueh’s ring**, a marker of his SUK training and affiliation.
