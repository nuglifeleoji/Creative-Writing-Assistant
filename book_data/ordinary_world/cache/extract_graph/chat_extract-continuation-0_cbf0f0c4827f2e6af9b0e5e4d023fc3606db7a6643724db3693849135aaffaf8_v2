\n　　本来兰香已经庆幸自己终于上完了初中。至于高中，她原来就没准备去上——原西城不象石圪节，花销更大！可是这初中，又要延长半年！ \n　　怎么办？她要不要继续上这半年学？要是不上，她连一张初中毕业证也拿不上！ \n　　但她又想：多上这半年学无非也就是能拿这毕业证书，如果命里注定一辈子当农民，那么，要这张纸片又顶什么用呢？而要是她早回去半年，除省了家里的费用，她还能挣不少工分，里外的钱不知能买多少张这样的纸片呢！ \n　　是啊，她上了这么多年学就已经不错了，不要象母亲和姐姐一样，连自己的名字都不认识。回家去吧！出山劳动挣工分，还得学点针线活——将来长大出嫁，一个农村妇女要会做的活计她都得学会……孙兰香于是就在心里决定：她不再继续上那半年学了；歪好把现在这半年上完，她就回家劳动去呀！ \n　　当她把这意思先给她的好朋友金秀说了以后，金秀马上难过得眼圈都红了，说：“你一定不能退学！如果你们家供不起你上学，我就哭着央求我爸我妈，让我们家供你！”兰香笑了，说：“你憨了，秀！怎能让你们家供我呢？再说，这上学也不顶事，将来还得劳动，迟回去不如早回去。你和我不一样，你爸在门外工作，高中毕业了，说不定还能在黄原给你寻个工作……” \n　　金秀不听她的话，流着眼泪让她千万不能退学。 \n　　但兰香是个有主意的孩子，她一旦周密考虑过的事，就不打算再改变。她想：我现在就应该给家里的大人说一下自己的打算…… \n　　这天回家吃完晚饭后，她父亲到院子里乘凉抽烟，她就从窑里撵出来，给父亲一个人把她的想法说了。她父亲听她说完，忧愁地说：“你说的也是实情。但爸爸不愿意你退学。将来上不上高中先不说，但初中既然已经上了，你要念到毕业。延长半年就延长半年吧……” \n　　这时候，她大哥吃完饭，也到院子里来了，父亲就对少安说：“兰香说她不想上学了，要回家来劳动呀，说人家上面规定，初中还要延长半年哩！” \n　　少安马上走过来，说：“怎么能不上学呢！”他用手在妹妹头上亲切地抚摸了一下，“延长半年怕什么！你好不容易把初中都快上完了，怎么能中途退学呢？初中毕业后，你还要到原西去上高中呢！到时，你二哥也毕业回来了，我和爸爸，你二哥，三个人劳动，还供不起你一个人？再不要胡盘算了，好好念你的书！咱们家常就这么个穷，又不在你那点花费上！你不念书咱照样就是这么个烂摊场……你千万不要再胡思量了！我\n######################\nOutput:",
