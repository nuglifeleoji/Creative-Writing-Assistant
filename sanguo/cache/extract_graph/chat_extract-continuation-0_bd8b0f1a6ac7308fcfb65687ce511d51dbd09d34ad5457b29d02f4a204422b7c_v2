正宴会庆贺间，忽报鄢陵侯曹彰，自长安领十万大军来到。丕大惊，遂问群臣曰：“黄须小弟；平日性刚，深通武艺。今提兵远来，必与孤争王位也。如之奈何？”忽阶下一人应声出曰：“臣请往见鄢陵侯，以片言折之。”众皆曰：“非大夫莫能解此祸也。”正是：试看曹氏丕彰事，几作袁家谭尚争。未知此人是谁，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第七十九回　兄逼弟曹植赋诗　侄陷叔刘封伏法\n\n    \t\t\n\n

于是曹丕安居王位，改建安二十五年为延康元年；封贾诩为太尉，华歆为相国，王朗为御史大夫；大小官僚，尽皆升赏。谥曹操曰武王，葬于邺郡高陵，令于禁董治陵事。禁奉命到彼，只见陵屋中白粉壁上，图画关云长水淹七军擒获于禁之事：画云长俨然上坐，庞德愤怒不屈，于禁拜伏于地，哀求乞命之状。原来曹丕以于禁兵败被擒，不能死节，既降敌而复归，心鄙其为人，故先令人图画陵屋粉壁，故意使之往见以愧之。当下于禁见此画像，又羞又恼，气愤成病，不久而死。后人有诗叹曰：“三十年来说旧交，可怜临难不忠曹。知人未向心中识，画虎今从骨里描。”\n\n
