You young pup!” Gurney kept saying.\nAnd Paul: “Gurney, man! Gurney, man!”\nPresently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep breath. “So you’re why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics. | might’ve known. They keep doing things I could’ve planned myself. If I'd only known....” He shook his head. “If you’d only got word to me, lad. Nothing would've stopped me. I’d have come arunning and...”\nA look in Paul’s eyes stopped him...the hard, weighing stare.\nGurney sighed. “Sure, and there’d have been those who wondered why Gurney Halleck went arunning, and some would’ve done more than question. They’d have gone hunting for answers.”\nPaul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them—the looks of curious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin. He turned from the death commandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled him with elation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the future where all was well.\nWith Gurney at my side....\nPaul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, Studied the smuggler crew who had come with Halleck.\n“How do your men stand, Gurney?” he asked.\n“They’re smugglers all,” Gurney said. “They stand where the profit is.”\n“Little enough profit in our venture,” Paul said, and he noted the subtle finger signal flashed to him by Gurney’s right hand—the old hand code out of their past. There were men to fear and distrust in the Smuggler crew.\nPaul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men standing guard above them on the rocks. He saw Stilgar there. Memory of the unsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Paul’s elation.\n“Stilgar,” he said, “this is Gurney Halleck of whom you’ve heard me speak. My father’s master-of-arms,\none of the swordmasters who instructed me, an old friend. He can be trusted in any venture.”\n“I hear,” Stilgar said. “You are his Duke.”\nPaul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had impelled Stilgar to say just that. His Duke. There had been a strange subtle intonation in Stilgar’s voice, as though he would rather have said something else. And that wasn't like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke his mind.\nMy Duke! Gurney thought. He looked anew at Paul. Yes, with Leto dead, the title fell on Paul’s shoulders.\nThe pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in Gurney’s mind. My Duke! A place that had been dead within him began coming alive. Only part of his awareness focused on Paul’s ordering the smuggler crew disarmed until they could be questioned.\nGurney’s mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men protesting. He shook his head, whirled. “Are you men deaf?” he barked. “This is the rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands.”\nGrumbling, the smugglers submitted.\nPaul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. “I’d not have expected you to walk into this trap, Gurney.”\n“I’m properly chastened,” Gurney said. “I'll wager yon patch of spice is little more than a sand grain’s thickness, a bait to lure us.”\n“That’s a wager you'd win,” Paul said. He looked down at the men being disarmed. “Are there any more of my father’s men among your crew?”\n“None. We’re spread thin. There’re a few among the free traders. Most have spent their profits to leave this place.”\n“But you stayed.”\n“I stayed.”\n“Because Rabban is here,” Paul said.\n“I thought | had nothing left but revenge,” Gurney Said.\nAn oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see a Fremen waving his kerchief.\n“A maker comes,” Paul said. He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney following, looked off to the southwest. The burrow mound of a worm could be seen in the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut directly through the dunes on a course toward the ridge.\n“He’s big enough,” Paul said.\nA clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them. It turned on its treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.\n“Too bad we couldn't have saved the carryall,” Paul said.\nGurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by Fremen rockets. He felt a sudden pang for the men lost there —his men, and he said: “Your father would’ve been more concerned for the men he couldn't save.”\nPaul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze. Presently, he said: “They were your friends, Gurney. | understand. To us, though, they were trespassers who\nmight see things they shouldn’t see. You must understand that.”\n“I understand it well enough,” Gurney said. “Now, I’m curious to see what I shouldn't.”\nPaul looked up to see the old and well- remembered wolfish grin on Halleck’s face, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the man’s jaw.\nGurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were going about their business all over the landscape. It struck him that none of them appeared worried by the approach of the worm.\nA thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice—a deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet. Gurney saw Fremen spread out across the sand there in the path of the worm.\nThe worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its rings rippling and twisting. In a moment, from his vantage point above the desert, Gurney saw the taking of a worm—the daring leap of the first hookman, the turning of the creature, the way an entire band of men went up the scaly, glistening curve of the worm’s side.\n“There’s one of the things you shouldn’t have seen,” Paul said.\n“There’s been stories and rumors,” Gurney said. “But it’s not a thing easy to believe without seeing it.” He shook his head. “The creature all men on Arrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal.”\n“You heard my father speak of desert power,” Paul said. “There it is. The surface of this planet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition can stop us.”\nUs, Gurney thought. He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one of them. Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Paul’s eyes. His own eyes, he knew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods and there was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them. They spoke of “the touch of the spicebrush” to mean a man had gone too native. And there was always a hint of distrust in the idea.\n“There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in these latitudes,” Paul said. “But Rabban has little enough air cover left that he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand.” He looked at Gurney. “Your aircraft were a shock to us here.”\nTo us...tO US....\nGurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. “We weren’t the shock to you that you were to us,” he said.\n“What’s the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?” Paul asked.\n“They say they’ve fortified the graben villages to the point where you cannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their defenses while you wear yourselves out in futile attack.”\n“In a word,” Paul said, “they’re immobilized.”\n“While you can go where you will,” Gurney said.\n“It’s a tactic | learned from you,” Paul said. “They've lost the initiative, which means they’ve lost the war.”\nGurney smiled, a slow, Knowing expression.\n“Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be,” Paul said. He glanced at Gurney. “Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign?”\n“Enlist?” Gurney stared at him. “My Lord, I’ve never left your service. You’re the only one left me... to think you dead. And |, being cast adrift, made what shrift | could, waiting for the moment | might sell my life for what it’s worth—the death of Rabban.”\nAn embarrassed silence settled over Paul.\nA woman came climbing up the rocks toward them, her eyes between stillsuit hood and face mask flicking between Paul and his companion. She Stopped in front of Paul. Gurney noted the possessive air about her, the way she stood close to Paul.\n“Chani,” Paul said, “this is Gurney Halleck. You’ve heard me speak of him.”\nShe looked at Halleck, back to Paul. “I have heard.”\n“Where did the men go on the maker?” Paul asked.\n“They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment.”\n“Well then....” Paul broke off, sniffed the air.\n“There’s wind coming,” Chani said.\nA voice called out from the ridgetop above them: “Ho, there—the wind!”\nGurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now—a rushing about and sense of hurry. A thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear of the wind. The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a way was opened for it among the rocks...and the rocks closed\nbehind it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes.\n“Have you many such hiding places?” Gurney asked.\n“Many times many,” Paul said. He looked at Chani. “Find Korba. Tell him that Gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew who’re not to be trusted.”\nShe looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks, leaping with a gazelle- like agility.\n“She is your woman,” Gurney said.\n“The mother of my firstborn,” Paul said. “There’s another Leto among the Atreides.”\nGurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.\nPaul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads.\n“Seal your suit,” Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his face.\nGurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.\nPaul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: “Which of your crew don’t you trust, Gurney?”\n“There’re some new recruits,” Gurney said. “Offworlders....” He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so easily to his tongue.\n“Yes?” Paul said.\n“They're not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is the Duke of Arrakis, trained in combat by Gurney Halleck, and a leader of the Fremen.
