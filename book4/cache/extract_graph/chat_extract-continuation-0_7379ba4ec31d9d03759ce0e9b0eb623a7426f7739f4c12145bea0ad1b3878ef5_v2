\n　　这一个晚班，孙少平几乎发疯似地干活。为了心中的痛苦，为了使这痛苦变为麻木，他借着酒劲，百斤重的钢梁铁柱在手中抡得象孙悟空的如意金箍棒。攉煤的时候，他把上衣也脱光撂在了回风巷中。铁锹雨点般在煤堆中起落。在他旁边不远处，安锁子背对着他，身上一条线不挂，撅着光屁股一边攉煤，一边嘴里还骂着什么——他就是不骂人，也要骂骂煤溜子或铁锹什么的。 \n　　孙少平突然在一片纷乱中，看见溜子拉出来一根钢梁，几乎象闪电一般朝安锁子的光屁股上戳去。在他还来不及发出惊叫的时候，就见从老坑里蹿出一条黑影，把那根长矛似的钢梁拼命往自己那边一扳，紧接着便传来一声悲惨的喊叫！这分明是师傅的声音！ \n　　少平丢下铁锹，几步就奔到了他身边。 \n　　所有干活的人都跑过来了。有人立刻用灯光晃动着，让机头那边停下了溜子。带班的副区长雷汉义也从机头那边跑过来。 \n　　那根钢梁无情地从王世才的肚子里戳进去，一直从后背上穿出来。 \n　　他死了！ \n　　少平把师傅抱在怀里，在黑暗中闭住了眼睛。 \n　　不息的热血在涓涓地流淌。这是矿工的血，血渗进煤中；血成为黑色——这染血的煤将变为熊熊炉火。难道我们还不能明白，为什么炉火总是那样鲜红……雷汉义双膝跪下，用自己的嘴对着那张没有气息的嘴，做人工呼吸。虽然毫无指望，但矿工们一个接一个对着王世才的嘴，希望用自己的气息让班长复活。 \n　　雷汉义沉默地摆了摆手，人们停止了这徒劳的努力。副区长再一次双膝跪地，在老战友的额头上亲了亲。黑暗中一片死一般的寂静。 \n　　不知什么地方，梁柱在大地的压力下，发出“叭、叭”的声响。 \n　　少平抹了一把脸上的泪水，把师傅背起来，离开掌子面，所有的人都跟在两边，沉寂地爬出了回风巷。 \n　　下绞车坡了。安锁子和其他人分别捉着师傅的胳膊腿，生怕被岩壁碰嗑着——他身上的伤已经够多了……在风门口，雷汉义自己背起了王世才，他叫几个人跟他上井，然后打发少平和其余的人都回掌子面继续干活。区长的话就是不容违抗的命令。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
