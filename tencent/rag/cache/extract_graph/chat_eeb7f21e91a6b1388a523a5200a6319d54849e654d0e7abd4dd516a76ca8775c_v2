Inflated decoys! Empty except for a miniature Holzmann generator and lasgun.” He added this to his Archives transmissions.\nWhen he was finished, he asked himself once more about the visions. /nfluencing my dreams? What have I tapped?\nIn every spare minute since becoming Teg’s Weapons Master, he had been calling up Archival records. There had to be some clue in all of that massive accumulation!\nResonances and tachyon theory held his attention for a time. Tachyon theory figured in Holzmann’s original design. “Techys,” Holzmann had called his energy source.\nA wave system that ignored light speed’s limits. Light speed obviously did not limit foldspace ships. Techys?\n“It works because it works,” Idaho muttered. “Faith. Like any other religion.”\nMentats squirreled away much seemingly inconsequential data. He had a storehouse marked “Techys” and proceeded\nto go through it without satisfaction.\nNot even Guild Navigators professed knowledge of how they guided foldspace ships. Ixian scientists made machines to duplicate Navigator abilities but still could not define what they did.\n“Holzmann’s formulae can be trusted.”\nNo one claimed to understand Holzmann. They merely used his formulae because they worked. It was the “ether” of space travel. You folded space. One instant you were here and the next instant you were countless parsecs distant.\nSomeone “out there” has found another way to use Holzmann’s theories! It was a full Mentat Projection. He knew its accuracy from the new questions it produced.\nMurbella’s Other Memory ramblings haunted him now even though he recognized basic Bene Gesserit teachings in them.\nPower attracts the corruptible. Absolute power attracts the absolutely corruptible. This is the danger of entrenched bureaucracy to its subject population. Even spoils systems are preferable because levels of tolerance are lower and the corrupt can be thrown out periodically. Entrenched bureaucracy seldom can be touched short of violence. Beware when Civil Service and Military join hands!\nThe Honored Matre achievement.\nPower for the sake of power... an aristocracy bred from unbalanced stock.\nWho were those people he saw? Strong enough to drive out Honored Matres. He knew it for a Projection datum.\nIdaho found this realization profoundly dislocating. Honored Matres fugitives! Barbaric but ignorant in the way of all such raiders even from before the Vandals. Moved by impulsive greed as much as by any other force. “Take Roman gold!” They filtered all distractions out of awareness. It was a stupefying ignorance that faltered only when the more sophisticated culture insinuated itself into the...\nAbruptly, he saw what Odrade was doing.\nGods below! What a fragile plan!\nHe pressed his palms against his eyes and forced himself not to cry out in anguish. Let them think I’m tired. But seeing Odrade’s plan told him also he would lose Murbella ... one way or another.\nWhen are the witches to be trusted? Never! The dark side of the magic universe belongs to the Bene Gesserit and we must reject them.\n— TYLWYTH WAFF, MASTER OF MASTERS\nhe great Common Room in the no-ship, with its tiered\nseating and raised platform at one end, was packed with Bene Gesserit Sisters, more than had ever before been assembled. Chapterhouse was almost at a standstill this afternoon because few wanted to send proxies and important decisions could not be delegated to service cadre. Black-robed Reverend Mothers dominated the assemblage in their aloof clusterings close to the stage but the room swirled with acolytes in white-trimmed robes and there were even the newly enrolled. Groups of white robes marking the youngest acolytes were sprinkled around in tight little groups, flocking for mutual support. All others had been excluded by Convocation Proctors.\nThe air was heavy with melange-perfumed breaths and it had that dank, overused quality it got when conditioning machinery was overloaded. Odors of the recent lunch, strong with garlic, rode on this atmosphere like an uninvited intruder. This and stories being spread throughout the room heightened tensions.\nMost kept their attention on the raised platform and the side door where Mother Superior must enter. Even while talking to companions or moving about, they focused on that place where they knew someone soon would enter and create profound changes in their lives. Mother Superior did not herd them all into a great Common Room with a promise\nof important announcements unless something to shake the Bene Gesserit foundations was at hand.\nBellonda preceded Odrade into the room, mounting to the platform with that belligerent waddle which made her easily recognizable even at a distance. Odrade followed Bellonda at five paces. Then came senior councillors and aides, blackrobed Murbella (still looking somewhat dazed from her Agony only two weeks past) among them. Dortujla limped close behind Murbella with Tam and Sheeana at her side. At the end of this procession came Streggi carrying Teg on her shoulders. There were excited murmurs when he appeared. Males seldom shared assemblies but everyone on Chapterhouse knew this was the ghola of their Mentat Bashar, living now at the cantonment with all that remained of a Bene Gesserit military.\nSeeing the massed ranks of the Sisterhood this way, Odrade experienced an empty feeling. Some ancient had said it all, she thought. “Any damned fool knows one horse can run faster than another.” Often at the minor assemblages here in this copy of a sports stadium she had been tempted to quote that bit of advice but she knew the ritual had its better purposes as well. Assembly showed you to one another.\nHere we are together. Our kind.\nMother Superior and attendants moved like a peculiar bundle of energy through the throng to the platform, her position of eminence at the edge of the arena.\nMother Superior was never subjected to the mass scrimmage of assemblies. She never had elbows jammed into her ribs or felt the trodding of a neighbor’s foot. She was never forced to move as others moved in a kind of inchworm flow composed of bodies pressed together in unwanted proximity.\nThus did Caesar arrive. Thumbs down on the whole damned thing! To Bellonda, she said: “Let it begin.”\nAfterward, she knew she would wonder why she had not delegated someone to make this ritual appearance and utter portentous words. Bellonda would love the pre- eminent position and, for that reason, must never have it. But perhaps there was some lower-echelon Sister who would be embarrassed by elevation and would obey only out of loyalty, out of that underlying need to do what Mother Superior commanded.\nGods! If there are any of you around, why do you permit us to be such sheep?\nThere they were, Bellonda preparing them for her. The battalions of the Bene Gesserit. They were not really battalions, but Odrade often imagined ranked Sisters, cataloguing them by function. That one is a squad leader. That one is a Captain General. This one is a lowly sergeant and here is a messenger.\nThe Sisters would be outraged if they knew this quirk in her. She kept it well concealed behind an “ordinary assignment” attitude. You could assign lieutenants without calling them lieutenants. Taraza had done the same thing.\nBell was telling them now that the Sisterhood might have to make a new accommodation with their captive Tleilaxu. Bitter words for Bell: “We have gone through the crucible, Tlelaxu and Bene Gesserit alike, and we have come out changed. In a way, we have changed each other.”\nYes, we are like rocks rubbed against each other for so long that each takes on some of the conforming shape required by the other. But the original rock is still there at the core!\nThe audience was becoming restive. They knew this was preliminary, no matter the hidden message within these hints about Tleilaxu. Preliminary and relative in importance. Odrade stepped to Bellonda’s side, signaling her to cut it Short.\n“Here is Mother Superior.”\nHow hard the old patterns die. Does Bell think they don’t recognize me?\nOdrade spoke in compelling tones, just short of Voice.\n“Actions have been taken that require me to meet on Junction with Honored Matre leadership, a meeting from which | may not emerge alive. | probably will not survive. That meeting will be partly distraction. We are about to punish them.”\nOdrade waited for murmurs to subside, hearing both agreement and disagreement in the sounds. Interesting. The ones who agreed were closer to the stage and farther back among new acolytes. Disagreement from advanced acolytes? Yes. They knew the warning: We dare not feed that fire.\nShe pitched her voice lower, letting remotes carry it to those in the high tiers. “Before leaving, | will Share with more than one Sister. These times require such caution.”\n“Your plan?” “What will you do?” Questions were shouted at her from many places.\n“We will feint at Gammu. That should drive Honored Matre allies to Junction. We then will take Junction and, | hope, capture the Spider Queen.”\n“The attack will occur while you are on Junction?” This question came from Garimi, a sober-faced Proctor directly below Odrade.\n“That is the plan. | will be transmitting my observations to the attackers.” Odrade gestured to Teg seated on Streggi’s shoulders. “The Bashar will lead the attack in person.”\n“Who goes with you?” “Yes. Who are you taking?” No mistaking the worry in those cries. So the word has not yet spread through Chapterhouse.\n“Tam and Dortujla,” Odrade said.\n“Who will Share with you?” Garimi again. Indeed! That is the political question of most interest. Who may succeed Mother Superior? Odrade heard nervous stirring behind her. Bellonda excited? Not you, Bell. You already know that.\n“Murbella and Sheeana,” Odrade said. “And one other if Proctors care to name a candidate.”\nProctors formed little consulting groups, shouting suggestions from group to group, but no names were submitted. Someone had a question though: “Why Murbella?”\n“Who knows Honored Matres better?” Odrade asked.\nThat silenced them.\nGarimi moved closer to the stage and looked up at Odrade with a penetrating stare. Don’t try to mislead a Reverend Mother, Darwi Odrade! “After our feint at Gammu, they will be even more alert and reinforced on Junction. What makes you think we can take them?”\nOdrade stepped aside and motioned Streggi forward with Teg.\nTeg had been watching Odrade’s performance with fascination. He looked down now at Garimi. She was currently Chief Assignment Proctor and no doubt had been chosen to speak for a bloc of Sisters. It occurred to Teg then that this ludicrous position on the shoulders of an acolyte had been planned by Odrade for reasons other than those she voiced.\nTo put my eyes closer to a level with adults around me... but also to remind them of my lesser stature, to reassure them that a Bene Gesserit (if only an acolyte) still controls my movements.\n“I will not go into all of the weaponry details at the moment,” he said. Damn this piping voice! He had their attention, though. “But we are going for mobility, for decoys that will destroy a great deal of the area around them if a lasgun beam hits them... and we are going to englobe Junction with devices to reveal the movements of their no- Ships.”\nWhen they continued to stare\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_eeb7f21e91a6b1388a523a5200a6319d54849e654d0e7abd4dd516a76ca8775c_v2"}
