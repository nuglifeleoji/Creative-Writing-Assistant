But | doubt he'll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis.”\n“You...took one?” Hawat asked.\n“It was a good fight,” the Fremen said. “We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.”\nThere were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!\n“We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. “Some of those are good fighters.”\nOne of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. “Are you talking about Sardaukar?”\n“He’s talking about Sardaukar,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar!” the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice. “Ah-h-h, so that’s what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?”\n“We...don’t know,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar,” the Fremen mused. “Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that not strange?”\n“The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,” Hawat said.\n“But you know they are Sardaukar.”\n“Who am I?” Hawat asked bitterly.\n“You are Thufir Hawat,” the man said matter-of- factly. “Well, we would have learned it in time. We’ve sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet’s men.”\nHawat’s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: “You...captured Sardaukar?”\n“Only three of them,” the Fremen said. “They fought well.”\nIf only we’d had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. /f only we could’ve trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we’d have had!\n“Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen said. “If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved.”\n“I serve the...Lisan al-Gaib,” Hawat said. “His welfare is my concern. I’ve pledged myself to this.”\n“You are pledged to his water?”\nHawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his attention to the squatting figure. “To his water, yes.”\n“You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?”\n“To...yes, to the place of his water.”\n“Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?” The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly.\nHawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among the men.\nThe Fremen said: “There is always a way to water.”\nBehind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat’s aide called: “Thufir! Arkie just died.”\nThe Fremen put a fist to his ear. “The bond of water! It’s a sign!” He stared at Hawat. “We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall | call my men?”\nThe aide returned to Hawat’s side, said: “Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen. They're... well, you know how it is at a time like this.”\nThe Fremen still held his fist to his ear. “Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?” he demanded.\nHawat’s mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen’s words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it.\n“The bond of water,” Hawat said.\n“Let our tribes be joined,” the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.\nAs though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with\nhim along the cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.\nIt was over before Hawat’s tired men could gather their wits. The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.\nOne of Hawat’s men shouted: “Where they going with Arkie? He was—”\n“They're taking him to...bury him,” Hawat said.\n“Fremen don’t bury their dead!” the man barked. “Don’t you try any tricks on us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of—”\n“Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen said. “If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures.”\nBut Hawat’s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a lasgun. He started to draw it.\n“Stop right where you are!” Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles. “These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but the meaning’s the same.”\n“They're going to render Arkie down for his water,” the man with the lasgun snarled.\n“Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?” the Fremen asked.\nHe doesn’t even see the problem, Hawat thought. The naïveté of the Fremen was frightening.\n“They’re concerned for a respected comrade,” Hawat said.\n“We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,” the Fremen said. “This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man’s flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.”\nHawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. “Will you now help our wounded?”\n“One does not question the bond,” the Fremen said. “We will do for you what a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and see to the necessities.”\nThe man with the lasgun hesitated.\nHawat’s aide said: “Are we buying help with Arkie’s...water?”\n“Not buying,” Hawat said. “We've joined these people.”\n“Customs differ,” one of his men muttered.\nHawat began to relax.\n“And they'll help us get to Arrakeen?”\n“We will kill Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. He grinned. “And Sardaukar.” He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: “An aircraft comes. Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless.”\nAt a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.\nThe Fremen took Hawat’s arm, pressed him back with the others. “We will fight in the time of fighting,” the man said. He reached beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.\nHawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.\nThe Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the animal’s head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bat’s upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen’s opened hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat’s head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.\nThe bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.\nThe Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his head, listening. “They quarter the high country,” he said. “One wonders who they seek up there.”\n“It’s known that we retreated in this direction,” Hawat said.\n“One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,” the Fremen said. “Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.”\nTime passed.\nSome of Hawat’s men stirred, whispering.\n“Remain silent as frightened animals,” the Fremen hissed.\nHawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff —flitting blurs of tan on tan.\n“My little friend carried his message,” the Fremen said. “He is a good messenger—day or night. I'll be unhappy to lose that one.”\nThe movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing\nremained but the growing pressure of the day’s heat —blurred columns of rising air.\n“Be most silent now,” the Fremen whispered.\nA file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.\nA “thwok-thwok” of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawat’s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them—an Atreides ‘thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The ’thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink.\nThe group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.\nThe ‘thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the ‘thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of Shields and, in their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.\n“Aiinh! They use their stupid shields,” the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.\n“They are Sardaukar,” Hawat whispered.\n“Good.”\nThe Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.\nAbruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the ornithopter, then\nin it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion.\nPresently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.\n“They left only three men in their ‘thopter,” the Fremen beside Hawat said. “That was fortunate. | don’t believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.”\nBehind Hawat, one of his men whispered: “Those were Sardaukar!”\n“Did you notice how well they fought?” the Fremen asked.\nHawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they fought well, indeed.”\nThe captured ‘thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\nSo these Fremen can handle ‘thopters, too, Hawat thought.\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once...twice.\n“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. Il’d hoped to", " ‘thopter,” the Fremen beside Hawat said. “That was fortunate. | don’t believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.”\nBehind Hawat, one of his men whispered: “Those were Sardaukar!”\n“Did you notice how well they fought?” the Fremen asked.\nHawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they fought well, indeed.”\nThe captured ‘thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\nSo these Fremen can handle ‘thopters, too, Hawat thought.\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once...twice.\n“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. Il’d hoped to have us away without more inconvenience.”\nInconvenience! Hawat thought.\nHe saw two more 'thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue—the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms— remained at the scene of violence.\nAnother ‘thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it—a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load—like a giant bird coming to its nest.\nIn the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving ‘thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.\n“The cowards!” the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.\nThe troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue- clad bodies. Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.\nHawat’s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a ‘thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the Sky. It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving ‘thopter plunged.\nA flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion ‘thopters had been—everything there caught in the flame.\nIt was the Fremen who took off in that captured ‘thopter, Hawat thought. He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are these Fremen?\n“A reasonable exchange,” said the Fremen beside Hawat. “There must’ve been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and\nmake plans to get another aircraft.” He started to step out of their rock-shadowed concealment.\nA rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.\nA thrown knife caught Hawat’s Fremen companion in the throat, hurling him backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.\nMuad’Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad’Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us “The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.” And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning “That path leads ever down into stagnation.”\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mother’s arm, snapped: “Don’t move!”\nThen he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.\n“It’s Idaho,” he breathed.\nThe craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest. Idaho was out of his ‘thopter and running toward them before the dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy-bearded Kynes.\n“This way!” Kynes called and he veered left.\nBehind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.\nIdaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. “M’Lord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we—”\n“What about that back there?”\nPaul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff —the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.\nA rare smile touched Idaho’s round, placid face. “M’Lord...Sire, I’ve left them a little sur—”\nGlaring white light filled the desert—bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had Paul’s arm in one hand, Jessica’s shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated.\nIdaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.\n“Not the family atomics!” Jessica said. “I thought\n”\n“You planted a shield back there,” Paul said.\n“A big one turned to full force,” Idaho said. “A lasgun beam touched it and....” He shrugged.\n“Subatomic fusion,” Jessica said. “That’s a dangerous weapon.”\n“Not weapon, m’Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time.”\nThe Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low voice: “We should get\nunder cover, friends.”\nPaul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.\n“That blast wi// attract considerable attention, Sire,” Idaho said.\nSire, Paul thought.\nThe word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been his father.\nHe felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools.\n“May | take your pack, Sire?” Idaho asked.\n“It’s not heavy, Duncan,” Paul said.\n“You have no body shield,” Idaho said. “Do you wish mine?” He glanced at the distant cliff. “Not likely there'll be any more lasgun activity about.”\n“Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me.”\nJessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.\nThe Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.\n“This way,” one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.\nBehind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner, found another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.\nKynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.\nIn the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping these people? It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done. It could doom me with them.\nThen he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be assumed—the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth—and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.\nJessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way —a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.\n“This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases,” Paul said.\nHis father wanted! Kynes thought.\nAnd again Kynes wondered at himself: Am / foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It'd be so\neasy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with them.\nPaul followed his mother’s example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the bench— dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them. An ozone smell permeated the place.\nSome of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds Started there—machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives.\nPaul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with Small animals in them stacked against the wall.\n“You've recognized this place correctly,” Kynes said. “For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?”\n“To make this planet a fit place for humans,” Paul said.\nPerhaps that’s why I help them, Kynes thought.\nThe machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.\nPaul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.\nA Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: “Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working. | am unable to mask us from proximity detectors.”\n“Can you repair it?” Kynes asked.\n“Not quickly. The parts....” The man shrugged.\n“Yes,” Kynes said. “Then we'll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the Surface.”\n“Immediately.” The man hurried away.\nKynes turned back to Paul. “You gave a good answer.”\nJessica marked the easy rumble of the man’s voice. It was a royal voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.\n“We're most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,” she said.\n“Mm-m-m, we'll see,” Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. “Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.”\n“At once, Liet,” the man said.\nKynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. “If you please?”\nJessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho", " shrugged.\n“Yes,” Kynes said. “Then we'll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the Surface.”\n“Immediately.” The man hurried away.\nKynes turned back to Paul. “You gave a good answer.”\nJessica marked the easy rumble of the man’s voice. It was a royal voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.\n“We're most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,” she said.\n“Mm-m-m, we'll see,” Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. “Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.”\n“At once, Liet,” the man said.\nKynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. “If you please?”\nJessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here.\nThe passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door as she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.\nPaul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He heard the door close behind him, studied the place—about eight meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on their right. A low desk with milk\nglass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the room’s center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.\nKynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the way her son examined the room.\nPaul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room’s air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing cabinets.\n“Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?” Kynes asked.\nHow carefully he avoids my title, Paul thought. But he accepted the chair, remained silent while Kynes sat down.\n“You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise,” Kynes said. “Yet, as you see, the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the Spice!”\nPaul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. “Do you see this ring?”\n“Yes.”\n“Do you know its significance?”\nJessica turned sharply to stare at her son.\n“Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen,” Kynes said. “You are technically the Duke.”\n“l'm a soldier of the Imperium,” Paul said, “technically a hatchetman.”\nKynes’ face darkened. “Even with the Emperor’s Sardaukar standing over your father’s body?”\n“The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another,” Paul said.\n“Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority,” Kynes said.\nAnd Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: There’s steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of...and we’ve need of steel. Paul’s doing a dangerous thing.\nPaul said: “The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved Emperor feared my father. Now, / will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear the—”\n“Lad,” Kynes said, “there are things you don’t—”\n“You will address me as Sire or my Lord,” Paul said.\nGently, Jessica thought.\nKynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologist’s face, the touch of humor there.\n“Sire,” Kynes said.\n“lam an embarrassment to the Emperor,” Paul said. “I am an embarrassment to all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil. As | live, | shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!”\n“Words,” Kynes said.\nPaul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: “You have a legend of the Lisan al-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen to paradise. Your men have—”\n“Superstition!” Kynes said.\n“Perhaps,” Paul agreed. “Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings.”\n“You have a plan,” Kynes said. “This much is obvious... Sire.”\n“Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?”\n“Quite likely.”\n“The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here,” Paul said. “Perhaps even Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before the Landsraad. Let him answer there where—”\n“Paul!” Jessica said.\n“Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case,” Kynes said, “there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the Great Houses.”\n“Chaos,” Jessica said.\n“But I’d present my case to the Emperor,” Paul said, “and give him an alternative to chaos.”\nJessica spoke in a dry tone: “Blackmail?”\n“One of the tools of statecraft, as you've said yourself,” Paul said, and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. “The Emperor has no sons, only daughters.”\n“You'd aim for the throne?” Jessica asked.\n“The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium Shattered by total war,” Paul said. “Planets blasted, disorder everywhere—he'll not risk that.”\n“This is a desperate gamble you propose,” Kynes Said.\n“What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?” Paul asked. “They fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis—the Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That’s why there is a\nLandsraad. This is the glue of the Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.”\n“But they’re—”\n“This is what they fear,” Paul said. “Arrakis would become a rallying cry. Each of them would see himself in my father—cut out of the herd and killed.”\nKynes spoke to Jessica: “Would his plan work?”\n“I’m no Mentat,” Jessica said.\n“But you are Bene Gesserit.”\nShe shot a probing stare at him, said: “His plan has good points and bad points...as any plan would at this stage. A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.”\n““Law is the ultimate science,’” Paul quoted. “Thus it reads above the Emperor’s door. | propose to show him law.”\n“And I’m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,” Kynes said. “Arrakis has its own plan that we—”\n“From the throne,” Paul said, “I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the wave of a hand. This is the coin | offer for your support.”\nKynes stiffened. “My loyalty’s not for sale, Sire.”\nPaul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul’s lips and he said: “Well spoken. | apologize.”\nKynes met Paul’s stare and, presently, said: “No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you’re not like them, Atreides.”\n“It could be a fault in their education,” Paul said. “You say you're not for sale, but I believe I’ve the coin you'll accept. For your loyalty | offer my loyalty to you...totally.”\nMy son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought. He has that tremendous, almost naive honor—and what a powerful force that truly is.\nShe saw that Paul’s words had shaken Kynes.\n“This is nonsense,” Kynes said. “You’re just a boy and—”\n“I’m the Duke,” Paul said. “I’m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond.”\nKynes swallowed.\n“When I say totally,” Paul said, “I mean without reservation. | would give my life for you.”\n“Sire!” Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a Superior. Now Kynes meant the word.\nIn this moment he’d give his life for Paul, she thought. How do the Atreides accomplish this thing so quickly, so easily?\n“I know you mean this,” Kynes said. “Yet the Harkon—”\nThe door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence—shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing in the passage.\nWith his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking the passage, his blood- pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the orange fire-mouth of a\nstunner repelled by the shield. Idaho’s blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.\nThen Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.\nPaul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen uniforms—his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.\n“I appear to’ve decided,” Kynes said.\n“Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down,” Paul said. He pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.\n“I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,” Kynes said.\n“You've a bolt hole out of here,” Paul said. “Shall we use it?”\nKynes took a deep breath, said: “This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.”\n“They'll not use a lasgun for fear we've shields on this side,” Paul said.\n“Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,” Jessica whispered.\nThey could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.\nKynes indicated the cabinets against the right- hand wall, said: “This way.” He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel. “This door also is plasteel,” Kynes said.\n“You were well prepared,” Jessica said.\n“We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,” Kynes said. He herded them into the darkness, closed the door.\nIn the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her.\nKynes’ voice came from behind them: “We'll separate here. This wall is tougher. It'll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that one on the floor. They'll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to another exit where I’ve secreted a ‘thopter. There’s a storm across the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing ‘thopters. If you stay high in the storm you'll survive.”\n“What of you?” Paul asked.\n“I'll try to escape another way. If I’m captured... well, I’m still Imperial Planetologist. | can say | was your captive.”\nRunning like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can l live to avenge my father? He turned to face the door.\nJessica heard him move, said, “Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.”\n“FII take full payment for them all one day,” Paul said.\n"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_9832fbaf1dd785045dfd0a334c912b75c7739ad4b85d63749c31d1f7c62522cc_v2"}
