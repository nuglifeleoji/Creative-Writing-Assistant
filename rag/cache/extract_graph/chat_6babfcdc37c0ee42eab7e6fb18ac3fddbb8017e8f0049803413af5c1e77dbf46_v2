Huge battles, and even one that is environmentally catastrophic, occur behind the scenes.\nAs | wrote in Dreamer of Dune, the biography of my father, Heretics of Dune was actually intended to be the first book of a new trilogy that would complete the epic story chronologically. It is set thousands of years in mankind’s future, long after the events in Dune. Before his untimely death in 1986, Frank Herbert wrote the first two books of the trilogy (Heretics and Chapterhouse), but he left the third unwritten. Using my father’s outline and notes, | eventually co-wrote the grand climax with Kevin J. Anderson, but it required two novels for us to do so—Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007).\nHeretics of Dune is the beginning of that extraordinary, climactic adventure, a giant leap in time and space beyond the novels preceding it. In this novel, you will meet a diverse and complex cast of characters, inhabiting worlds that stretch the imagination. It is a journey into what my father liked to call one of humankind’s “possible futures,” showing where we might very well be headed, into a tableau that is at once terrifying and exhilarating. Even with its complexities, Heretics is a page-turner, a novel that will not disappoint the most critical of Dune fans. After reading the last page of the book, you will want to go back and read it again, revisiting old friends in a fantastic realm that never quite leaves your thoughts.\nBrian Herbert Seattle, Washington\nJune 24, 2008\nMost discipline is hidden discipline, designed not to liberate but to limit. Do not ask Why? Be cautious with How? Why? leads inexorably to paradox. How? traps you in a universe of cause and effect. Both deny the infinite.\n—THE APOCRYPHA OF ARRAKIS\nvy lees told you, did she not, that we have gone through eleven of these Duncan Idaho gholas? This one is the twelfth.”\nThe old Reverend Mother Schwangyu spoke with deliberate bitterness as she looked down from the third- story parapet at the lone child playing on the enclosed lawn. The planet Gammu’s bright midday sunlight bounced off the white courtyard walls filling the area beneath them with brilliance as though a spotlight had been directed onto the young ghola.\nGone through! the Reverend Mother Lucilla thought. She allowed herself a short nod, thinking how coldly impersonal were Schwangyu’s manner and choice of words. We have used up our supply; send us more!\nThe child on the lawn appeared to be about twelve standard years of age, but appearance could be deceptive with a ghola not yet awakened to his original memories. The child took that moment to look up at the watchers above him. He was a sturdy figure with a direct gaze that focused intently from beneath a black cap of karakul hair. The yellow sunlight of early spring cast a small shadow at his feet. His Skin was darkly tanned but a slight movement of his body shifted his blue singlesuit, revealing pale skin at the left shoulder.\n“Not only are these gholas costly but they are supremely dangerous to us,” Schwangyu said. Her voice came out flat\nand emotionless, all the more powerful because of that. It was the voice of a Reverend Mother Instructor speaking down to an acolyte and it emphasized for Lucilla that Schwangyu was one of those who protested openly against the ghola project.\nTaraza had warned: “She will try to win you over.”\n“Eleven failures are enough,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla glanced at Schwangyu’s wrinkled features, thinking suddenly: Someday I may be old and wizened, too. And perhaps I will be a power in the Bene Gesserit as well.\nSchwangyu was a small woman with many age marks earned in the Sisterhood’s affairs. Lucilla knew from her own assignment-studies that Schwangyu’s conventional black robe concealed a skinny figure that few other than her acolyte dressers and the males bred to her had ever seen. Schwangyu’s mouth was wide, the lower lip constricted by the age lines that fanned into a jutting chin. Her manner tended to a curt abruptness that the uninitiated often interpreted as anger. The commander of the Gammu Keep was one who kept herself to herself more than most Reverend Mothers.\nOnce more, Lucilla wished she knew the entire scope of the ghola project. Taraza had drawn the dividing line clearly enough, though: “Schwangyu is not to be trusted where the safety of the ghola is concerned.”\n“We think the Tleilaxu themselves killed most of the previous eleven,” Schwangyu said. “That in itself should tell us something.”\nMatching Schwangyu’s manner, Lucilla adopted a quiet attitude of almost emotionless waiting. Her manner said: “| may be much younger than you, Schwangyu, but I, too, am a full Reverend Mother.” She could feel Schwangyu’s gaze.\nSchwangyu had seen the holos of this Lucilla but the woman in the flesh was more disconcerting. An Imprinter of the best training, no doubt of it. Blue-in-blue eyes uncorrected by any lens gave Lucilla a piercing expression\nthat went with her long oval face. With the hood of her black aba robe thrown back as it was now, brown hair was revealed, drawn into a tight barette and then cascading down her back. Not even the stiffest robe could completely hide Lucilla’s ample breasts. She was from a genetic line famous for its motherly nature and she already had borne three children for the Sisterhood, two by the same sire. Yes —a brown-haired charmer with full breasts and a motherly disposition.\n“You say very little,” Schwangyu said. “This tells me that Taraza has warned you against me.”\n“Do you have reason to believe assassins will try to kill this twelfth ghola?” Lucilla asked.\n“They already have tried.”\nStrange how the word “heresy” came to mind when thinking of Schwangyu, Lucilla thought. Could there be heresy among the Reverend Mothers? The religious overtones of the word seemed out of place in a Bene Gesserit context. How could there be heretical movements among people who held a profoundly manipulative attitude toward all things religious?\nLucilla shifted her attention down to the ghola, who took this moment to perform a series of cartwheels that brought him around full circle until he once more stood looking up at the two observers on the parapet.\n“How prettily he performs!” Schwangyu sneered. The old voice did not completely mask an underlying violence.\nLucilla glanced at Schwangyu. Heresy. “Dissidence” was not the proper word. “Opposition” did not cover what could be sensed in the older woman. This was something that could shatter the Bene Gesserit. Revolt against Taraza, against the Reverend Mother Superior? Unthinkable! Mother Superiors were cast in the mold of monarch. Once Taraza had accepted counsel and advice and then made her decision, the Sisters were committed to obedience.\n“This is no time to be creating new problems!” Schwangyu said.\nHer meaning was clear. People from the Scattering were coming back and the intent of some among those Lost Ones threatened the Sisterhood. Honored Matres! How like “Reverend Mothers” the words sounded.\nLucilla ventured an exploratory sally: “So you think we should be concentrating on the problem of those Honored Matres from the Scattering?”\n“Concentrating? Hah! They do not have our powers. They do not show good sense. And they do not have mastery of melange! That is what they want from us, our spice knowledge.”\n“Perhaps,” Lucilla agreed. She was not willing to concede this on the scanty evidence.\n“Mother Superior Taraza has taken leave of her senses to dally with this ghola thing now,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla remained silent. The ghola project definitely had touched an old nerve among the Sisters. The possibility, even remote, that they might arouse another Kwisatz Haderach sent shudders of angry fear through the ranks. To meddle with the worm-bound remnants of the Tyrant! That was dangerous in the extreme.\n“We should never take that ghola to Rakis,” Schwangyu muttered. “Let sleeping worms lie.”\nLucilla gave her attention once more to the ghola-child. He had turned his back on the high parapet with its two Reverend Mothers, but something about his posture said he knew they discussed him and he awaited their response.\n“You doubtless realize that you have been called in while he is yet too young,” Schwangyu said.\n“| have never heard of the deep imprinting on one that young,” Lucilla agreed. She allowed something softly self- mocking in her tone, a thing she knew Schwangyu would hear and misinterpret. The management of procreation and all of its attendant necessities, that was the Bene Gesserit\nultimate specialty. Use love but avoid it, Schwangyu would be thinking now. The Sisterhood’s analysts knew the roots of love. They had examined this quite early in their development but had never dared breed it out of those they influenced. Tolerate love but guard against it, that was the rule. Know that it lay deep within the human genetic makeup, a safety net to insure continuation of the species. You used it where necessary, imprinting selected individuals (Sometimes upon each other) for the Sisterhood’s purposes, knowing then that such individuals would be linked by powerful bonding lines not readily available to the common awareness. Others might observe such links and plot the consequences but the linked ones would dance to unconscious music.\n“I was not suggesting that it’s a mistake to imprint him,” Schwangyu said, misreading Lucilla’s silence.\n“We do what we are ordered to do,” Lucilla chided. Let Schwangyu make of that what she would.\n“Then you do not object to taking the ghola to Rakis,” Schwangyu said. “I wonder if you would continue such unquestioning obedience if you knew the full story?”\nLucilla inhaled a deep breath. Was the entire design for the Duncan Idaho gholas to be shared with her now?\n“There is a female child named Sheeana Brugh on Rakis,” Schwangyu said. “She can control the giant worms.”\nLucilla concealed her alertness. Giant worms. Not Shai- hulud. Not Shaitan. Giant worms. The sandrider predicted by the Tyrant had appeared at last!\n“I do not make idle chatter,” Schwangyu said when Lucilla continued silent.\nIndeed not, Lucilla thought. And you call a thing by its descriptive label, not by the name of its mystical import. Giant worms. And you're really thinking about the Tyrant, Leto II, whose endless dream is carried as a pearl of awareness in each of those worms. Or so we are led to believe.\nSchwangyu nodded toward the child on the lawn below them. “Do you think their ghola will be able to influence the girl who controls the worms?”\nWe’re peeling away the skin at last, Lucilla thought. She said: “I have no need for the answer to such a question.”\n“You are a cautious one,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla arched her back and stretched. Cautious? Yes, indeed! Taraza had warned her: “Where Schwangyu is concerned, you must act with extreme caution but with speed. We have a very narrow window of time within which we can succeed.”\nSucceed at what? Lucilla wondered. She glanced sideways at Schwangyu. “I\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6babfcdc37c0ee42eab7e6fb18ac3fddbb8017e8f0049803413af5c1e77dbf46_v2"}
