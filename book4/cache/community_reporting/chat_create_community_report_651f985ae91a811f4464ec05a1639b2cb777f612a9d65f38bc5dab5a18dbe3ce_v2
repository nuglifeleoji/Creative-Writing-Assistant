This suggests a broader critique of the干部's awareness and empathy towards the challenges encountered by less privileged individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the descriptions indicate that干部 includes officials from the Municipal Committee, who are portrayed as neglectful or indifferent, as illustrated by their departure from the scene when another character, 秦富功, was hospitalized.
