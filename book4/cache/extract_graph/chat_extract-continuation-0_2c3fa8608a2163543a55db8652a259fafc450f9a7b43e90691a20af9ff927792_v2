\n　　“这当然没问题。就是《参考消息》，我也可以一个星期给你集中寄一次，你看完保存好就行了。其它报纸听你说咱村的学校里都有？不管怎样，千万不能放弃读书！我生怕我过几年再见到你的时候，你已经完全变成了另外一个人。满嘴说的都是吃；肩膀上搭着个褡裢，在石圪节街上瞅着买个便宜猪娃；为几报柴禾或者一颗鸡蛋，和邻居打得头破血流。牙也不刷，书都扯着糊了粮食囤……” \n　　孙少平仰起头，笑得都快喷饭了。这个晓霞啊！笑毕，他说：“我不会变成你描绘的那种形象。”他立刻严肃起来，“你不知道，我心里很痛苦。不知为什么，我现在特别想到一个更艰苦的地方去。越远越好。哪怕是在北极的冰天雪地里；或者象杰克·伦敦小说中描写的严酷的阿拉斯加……” \n　　“我很赞赏你的这种想法！”晓霞用热情而鼓励的目光望着充满激情的少平。
