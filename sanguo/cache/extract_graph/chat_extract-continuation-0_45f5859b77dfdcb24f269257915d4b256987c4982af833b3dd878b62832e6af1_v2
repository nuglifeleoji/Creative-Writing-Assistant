在外为游兵，往来接应。俭移檄诸郡，令各起兵相助。却说司马师左眼肉瘤，不时痛痒，乃命医官割之，以药封闭，连日在府养病；忽闻淮南告急，乃请太尉王肃商议。肃曰：“昔关云长威震华夏，孙权令吕蒙袭取荆州，抚恤将士家属，因此关公军势瓦解，今淮南将士家属，皆在中原，可急抚恤，更以兵断其归路：必有土崩之势矣。”师曰：“公言极善。但吾新割目瘤，不能自往。若使他人，心又不稳。”时中书侍郎钟会在侧，进言曰：“淮楚兵强，其锋甚锐；若遣人领兵去退，多是不利。倘有疏虞，则大事废矣。”师蹶然起曰：“非吾自在，不可破贼！”遂留弟司马昭守洛阳，总摄朝政。师乘软舆，带病东行。令镇东将军诸葛诞，总督豫州诸军，从安风津取寿春；又令征东将军胡遵，领青州诸军，出谯、宋之地，绝其归路；又遣荆州刺史、监军王基，领前部兵，先取镇南之地。师领大军屯于襄阳，聚文武于帐下商议。光禄勋郑袤曰：“毋丘俭好谋而无断，文钦有勇而无智。今大军出其不意，江、淮之卒锐气正盛，不可轻敌；只宜深沟高垒，以挫其锐。此亚夫之长策也。”监军王基曰：“不可。淮南之反，非军民思乱也；皆因毋丘俭势力所逼，不得已而从之。若大军一临，必然瓦解。”师曰：“此言甚妙。”遂进兵于濦水之上，中军屯于濦桥。基曰：“南顿极好屯兵，可提兵星夜取之。若迟则毋丘俭必先至矣。”师遂令王基领前部兵来南顿城下寨。\n\n    却说毋丘俭在项城，闻知司马师自来，乃聚众商议。先锋葛雍曰：“南顿之地，依山傍水，极好屯兵；若魏兵先占，难以驱遣，可速取之。”俭然其言，起兵投南顿来。正行之间，前面流星马报说，南顿已有人马下寨。俭不信，自到军前视之，果然旌旗遍野，营寨齐整。俭回到军中，无计可施。忽哨马飞报：“东吴孙峻提兵渡江袭寿春来了。”俭大惊曰：“寿春若失，吾归何处！”是夜退兵于项城。\n\n    司马师见毋丘俭军退，聚多官商议。尚书傅嘏曰：“今俭兵退者，忧吴人袭寿春也。必回项城分兵拒守。将军可令一军取乐嘉城，一军取项城，一军取寿春，则淮南之卒必退矣。兖州刺史邓艾，足智多谋；若领兵径取乐嘉\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
