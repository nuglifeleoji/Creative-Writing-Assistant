As the Baron's twisted advisor and torturer, he plays a key role in interrogations, notably assisting in the interrogation of **Duke Leto Atreides**. Piter is highly efficient in his duties, aiding the Baron in scheming against **House Atreides**, but his emotional instability—exacerbated by excessive spice consumption—often leads to erratic outbursts and sadistic behavior.  \n\nDespite his logical reasoning and tactical prowess, Piter harbors a deep-seated fear of **Truthsayers**, which contrasts with his otherwise ruthless demeanor. His sadistic streak and penchant for cruelty make him a feared figure within the Harkonnen hierarchy. Ultimately, Piter meets his demise during **Duke Leto's assassination attempt**, marking the end of his treacherous service to the Baron.  \n\nIn summary, Piter is a complex and volatile figure—brilliant yet unstable, calculating yet prone to emotional extremes—whose loyalty to the Baron is unwavering until his death.
