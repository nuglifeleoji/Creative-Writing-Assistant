His influence over the emperor was significant, as he played a crucial role in court politics and decision-making processes, especially concerning military actions. However, this influence was met with considerable criticism, as many viewed it as detrimental to the state. \n\nCritics of 黄皓 pointed to his involvement in the downfall of several ministers, suggesting that his manipulative tactics and power plays undermined the stability of the Shu Han government. His advisory role during critical moments, such as the military crisis involving 邓艾, further highlighted his central position in the court. Despite being consulted on military matters, his decisions were often seen as harmful to the state, leading to his eventual punishment by 司马昭, who sought to curb the negative impact of 黄皓's influence.\n\n黄皓 was also identified as a eunuch, a position that historically allowed for significant power within the imperial court, particularly during the late Eastern Han dynasty. His ability to manipulate power dynamics made him a controversial figure, as he was perceived to have a detrimental effect on the governance of Shu Han.
