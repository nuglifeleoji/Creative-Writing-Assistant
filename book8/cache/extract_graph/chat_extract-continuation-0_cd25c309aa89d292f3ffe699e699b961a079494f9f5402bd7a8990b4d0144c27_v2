乐卿灵一向对新生事物有着浓厚的好奇心，顿时快步跑了过去。当她离得近了，反而放慢了脚步。因为她吃惊的发现，那似乎是一个人。这个人的身体有一半浸泡在海水之中。还有另外一半在沙滩上。但他似乎很重，无论海水怎么冲刷，他就像是扎在沙滩上了似的，一动不动。\n\n    那是……\n\n    尸体？\n\n    乐卿灵机灵灵打了个寒颤，顿时止住了步伐。海边怎么会有尸体啊？\n\n    她定了定神，深吸口气，一层淡淡的白色光晕从体内涌出，紧接着，脚下两黄一紫，三个魂环缓缓升起。\n\n    “怕什么？我可是大魂师呢。就算他是个怨灵、僵尸什么的，我也能给他净化了。看我的，圣光，照耀！”\n\n    身上排列在第一位的黄色魂环闪亮，一道白光从她手上射出，直奔那“尸体”而去。\n\n    眼看着白光照耀在那人身上，她对自己这一下很满意。她这圣光对于正常人来说，有治疗和净化效果。对于那些不好的邪祟，净化就会变成攻击，效果极好。\n\n    白光落在那人身上，乐卿灵借助光芒也看的清楚了，那人露在外面的是两条腿，上半身还都在海水下面。这就更加坚定了她，这是一具尸体的念头。淹也淹死了啊！\n\n    只是，在圣光的照耀下，那人露在外面的两条腿显得很有光泽，笔直而修长。一直到膝盖以上半尺处，才浸泡在海水中。\n\n    “呼。”乐卿灵长出口气，心中暗想，这果然只是一具尸体。只要报警，让有关部门来收尸就是了。\n\n    圣光收回，正当乐卿灵准备用自己的魂导通讯器联络相关部门时，令她万万没想到的一幕发生了。\n\n    只听“哗啦啦”一声水响，男人竟是猛的从海里坐了起来。除了臀部和男性关键部位还在海水之中以外，上本身已是完全露出了水面。\n\n    “啊——”乐卿灵尖叫一声，先前什么勇气之类的，早就已经被她抛诸脑后。她猛的一个后跃，转身就跑。\n\n    她毕竟有着三环大魂师层次的修为，这一冲出去，速度简直是奇快无比。转瞬间就已经在百米开外。\n\n    知道这会儿才敢回头去看。只见那人依旧坐在水里，似乎轻轻的摇了摇头，却并没有要追来的意思。\n\n    胸前起伏不定，乐卿灵一边拍着胸口，稳定着自己惊慌失措的情绪，一边放慢了脚步，缓缓停了下来。\n\n    “我是大魂师、我是大魂师，我怕什么啊！我有什么可怕的啊！不怕、不怕！就不怕！”\n\n    她再次转过身，却没敢靠\n######################\nOutput:",
