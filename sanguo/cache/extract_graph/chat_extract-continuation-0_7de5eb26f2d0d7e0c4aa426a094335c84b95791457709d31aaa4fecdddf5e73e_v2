点三万军，与玄德前去。玄德领命即行，不一日，来到江夏。张武、陈孙引兵来迎。玄德与关、张、赵云出马在门旗下，望见张武所骑之马，极其雄骏。玄德曰：“此必千里马也。”言未毕，赵云挺枪而出，径冲彼阵。张武纵马来迎，不三合，被赵云一枪刺落马下，随手扯住辔头，牵马回阵。陈孙见了，随赶来夺。张飞大喝一声，挺矛直出，将陈孙刺死。众皆溃散。玄德招安余党，平复江夏诸县，班师而回。表出郭迎接入城，设宴庆功。酒至半酣，表曰：“吾弟如此雄才，荆州有倚赖也。但忧南越不时来寇，张鲁、孙权皆足为虑。”玄德曰：“弟有三将，足可委用：使张飞巡南越之境；云长拒固子城，以镇张鲁；赵云拒三江，以当孙权。何足虑哉？”表喜，欲从其言。\n\n    蔡瑁告其姊蔡夫人曰：“刘备遣三将居外，而自居荆州，久必为患。”蔡夫人乃夜对刘表曰：“我闻荆州人多与刘备往来，不可不防之。今容其居住城中，无益，不若遣使他往。”表曰：“玄德仁人也。”蔡氏曰：“只恐他人不似汝心。”表沉吟不答。次日出城，见玄德所乘之马极骏，问之，知是张武之马，表称赞不已。玄德遂将此马送与刘表。表大喜，骑回城中。蒯越见而问之。表曰：“此玄德所送也。”越曰：“昔先兄蒯良，最善相马；越亦颇晓。此马眼下有泪槽，额边生白点，名为的卢，骑则妨主。张武为此马而亡。主公不可乘之。”表听其言。次日请玄德饮宴，因言曰：“昨承惠良马，深感厚意。但贤弟不时征进，可以用之。敬当送还。”玄德起谢。表又曰：“贤弟久居此间，恐废武事。襄阳属邑新野县，颇有钱粮。弟可引本部军马于本县屯扎，何如？”玄德领诺。次日，谢别刘表，引本部军马径往新野。\n\n    方出城门，只见一人在马前长揖曰：“公所骑马，不可乘也。”玄德视之，乃荆州幕宾伊籍，字机伯，山阳人也。玄德忙下马问之。籍曰：“昨闻蒯异度对刘荆州云：此马名的卢，乘则妨主。因此还公。公岂可复乘之？”玄德曰：“深感先生见爱。但凡人死生有命，岂马所能妨哉！”籍服其高见，自此常与玄德往来。玄德自到新野，军民皆喜，政治一新。建安十二年春，甘夫人生刘禅。是夜有白鹤一只，飞来县衙屋上，高鸣四十余声，望西飞去。临分�\n######################\nOutput:",
