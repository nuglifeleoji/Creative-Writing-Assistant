He is profoundly in love with Runye, yet she does not reciprocate his feelings, leading to considerable emotional distress for him.\n\nLi Xiangqian's love for Runye is complicated by his sense of despair, as he grapples with the reality of her indifference.

Despite the challenges, Li Xiangqian remains emotionally connected to Runye and has been buying gifts for her, hoping to rekindle their relationship and anticipating a reunion.\n\nHowever, his actions have disrupted Runye's previously peaceful life, causing her significant emotional distress. She feels pressured by Li Xiangqian's persistent affection and is conflicted about her feelings towards him.
