He felt a momentary pang for the real daughter of Otheym—dead now, a corpse in the sand. There was no time for such emotions, though. He scowled.\nBannerjee kept his attention on the girl.\n“| was told to deliver my message in secret,” she said.\n“Why?” Bannerjee demanded, voice harsh, probing.\n“Because it is my father’s wish.”\n“This is my friend,” Paul said. “Am | not a Fremen? Then my friend may hear anything | hear.”\nScytale composed the girl-shape. Was this a true Fremen custom... or was it a test?\n“The Emperor may make his own rules,” Scytale said. “This is the message: My father wishes you to come to him, bringing Chani.”\n“Why must I bring Chani?”\n“She is your woman and a Sayyadina. This is a Water matter, by the rules of our tribes. She must attest it that my father speaks according to the Fremen Way.”\nThere truly are Fremen in the conspiracy, Paul thought. This moment fitted the shape of things to come for sure. And he had no alternative but to commit himself to this course.\n“Of what will your father speak?” Paul asked.\n“He will speak of a plot against you—a plot among the Fremen.”\n“Why doesn’t he bring that message in person?” Bannerjee demanded.\nShe kept her gaze on Paul. “My father cannot come here. The plotters suspect him. He’d not survive the journey.”\n“Could he not divulge the plot to you?” Bannerjee asked. “How came he to risk his daughter on such a mission?”\n“The details are locked in a distrans carrier that only Muad’Dib may open,” she said. “This much I know.”\n“Why not send the distrans, then?” Paul asked.\n“It is a human distrans,” she said.\n“I'll go, then,” Paul said. “But l'Il go alone.”\n“Chani must come with you!”\n“Chani is with child.”\n“When has a Fremen woman refused to...”\n“My enemies fed her a subtle poison,” Paul said. “It will be a difficult birth. Her health will not permit her to accompany me now.”\nBefore Scytale could still them, strange emotions passed over the girl-features: frustration, anger. Scytale was reminded that every victim must have a way of escape—\neven such a one as Muad’Dib. The conspiracy had not failed, though. This Atreides remained in the net. He was a creature who had developed firmly into one pattern. He’d destroy himself before changing into the opposite of that pattern. That had been the way with the Tleilaxu kwisatz haderach. It’d be the way with this one. And then... the ghola.\n“Let me ask Chani to decide this,” she said.\n“| have decided it,” Paul said. “You will accompany me in Chani’s stead.”\n“It requires a Sayyadina of the Rite!”\n“Are you not Chani’s friend?”\nBoxed! Scytale thought. Does he suspect? No. He’s being Fremen-cautious. And the contraceptive is a fact. Well— there are other ways.\n“My father told me I was not to return,” Scytale said, “that | was to seek asylum with you. He said you’d not risk me.”\nPaul nodded. It was beautifully in character. He couldn’t deny this asylum. She’d plead Fremen obedience to a father’s command.\n“I'll take Stilgar’s wife, Harah,” Paul said. “You'll tell us the way to your father.”\n“How do you know you can trust Stilgar’s wife?”\n“I know it.”\n“But | don’t.”\nPaul pursed his lips, then: “Does your mother live?”\n“My true mother has gone to Shai-hulud. My second mother still lives and cares for my father. Why?”\n“She’s of Sietch Tabr?”\n“Yes.”\n“| remember her,” Paul said. “She will serve in Chani’s place.” He motioned to Bannerjee. “Have attendants take Otheym’s Lichna to suitable quarters.”\nBannerjee nodded. Attendants. The key word meant that this messenger must be put under special guard. He took\nher arm. She resisted.\n“How will you go to my father?” she pleaded.\n“You'll describe the way to Bannerjee,” Paul said. “He is my friend.”\n“No! My father has commanded it! | cannot!”\n“Bannerjee?” Paul said.\nBannerjee paused. Paul saw the man searching that encyclopedic memory which had helped bring him to his position of trust. “I Know a guide who can take you to Otheym,” Bannerjee said.\n“Then l'Il go alone,” Paul said.\n“Sire, if you...”\n“Otheym wants it this way,” Paul said, barely concealing the irony which consumed him.\n“Sire, it’s too dangerous,” Bannerjee protested.\n“Even an Emperor must accept some risks,” Paul said. “The decision is made. Do as I’ve commanded.”\nReluctantly, Bannerjee led the Face Dancer from the room.\nPaul turned toward the blank screen behind his desk. He felt that he waited for the arrival of a rock on its blind journey from some height.\nShould he tell Bannerjee about the messenger’s true nature? he wondered. No! Such an incident hadn’t been written on the screen of his vision. Any deviation here carried precipitate violence. A moment of fulcrum had to be found, a place where he could will himself out of the vision.\nIf such a moment existed...\nNo matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.\n—FROM THE TLEILAXU GODBUK\nA? he crossed over on the high footbridge from his Keep to the Qizarate Office Building, Paul added a limp to his walk. It was almost sunset and he walked through long shadows that helped conceal him, but sharp eyes still might detect something in his carriage that identified him. He wore a Shield, but it was not activated, his aides having decided that the shimmer of it might arouse suspicions.\nPaul glanced left. Strings of sandclouds lay across the sunset like slatted shutters. The air was hiereg dry through his stillsuit filters.\nHe wasn’t really alone out here, but the web of Security hadn’t been this loose around him since he’d ceased walking the streets alone in the night. Ornithopters with night scanners drifted far overhead in seemingly random patterns, all of them tied to his movements through a transmitter concealed in his clothing. Picked men walked the streets below. Others had fanned out through the city after seeing the Emperor in his disguise—Fremen costume down to the stillsuit and temag desert boots, the darkened features. His cheeks had been distorted with plastene inserts. A catchtube ran down along his left jaw.\nAs he reached the opposite end of the bridge, Paul glanced back, noted a movement beside the stone lattice that concealed a balcony of his private quarters. Chani, no\ndoubt. “Hunting for sand in the desert,” she’d called this venture.\nHow little she understood the bitter choice. Selecting among agonies, he thought, made even lesser agonies near unbearable.\nFor a blurred, emotionally painful moment, he relived their parting. At the last instant, Chani had experienced a tau-glimpse of his feelings, but she had misinterpreted. She had thought his emotions were those experienced in the parting of loved ones when one entered the dangerous unknown.\nWould that I did not know, he thought.\nHe had crossed the bridge now and entered the upper passageway through the office building. There were fixed glowglobes here and people hurrying on business. The Qizarate never slept. Paul found his attention caught by the signs above doorways, as though he were seeing them for the first time: Speed Merchants. Wind Stills and Retorts. Prophetic Prospects. Tests of Faith. Religious Supply. Weaponry ... Propagation of the Faith...\nA more honest label would’ve been Propagation of the Bureaucracy, he thought.\nA type of religious civil servant had sprung up all through his universe. This new man of the Qizarate was more often a convert. He seldom displaced a Fremen in the key posts, but he was filling all the interstices. He used melange as much to show he could afford it as for the geriatric benefits. He stood apart from his rulers—Emperor, Guild, Bene Gesserit, Landsraad, Family or Qizarate. His gods were Routine and Records. He was served by mentats and prodigious filing systems. Expediency was the first word in his catechism, although he gave proper lip-service to the precepts of the Butlerians. Machines could not be fashioned in the image of a man’s mind, he said, but he betrayed by every action that he preferred machines to men, statistics to individuals, the\nfaraway general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and initiative.\nAs Paul emerged onto the ramp at the far side of the building, he heard the bells calling the Evening Rite at Alia’s Fane.\nThere was an odd feeling of permanence about the bells.\nThe temple across the thronged square was new, its rituals of recent devising, but there was something about this setting in a desert sink at the edge of Arrakeen— something in the way wind-driven sand had begun to weather stones and plastene, something in the haphazard way buildings had gone up around the Fane. Everything conspired to produce the impression that this was a very old place full of traditions and mystery.\nHe was down into the press of people now—committed. The only guide his Security force could find had insisted it be done this way. Security hadn’t liked Paul’s ready agreement. Stilgar had liked it even less. And Chani had objected most of all.\nThe crowd around him, even while its members brushed against him, glanced his way unseeing and passed on, gave him a curious freedom of movement. It was the way they’d been conditioned to treat a Fremen, he knew. He carried himself like a man of the inner desert. Such men were quick to anger.\nAs he moved into the quickening flow to the temple steps, the crush of people became even greater. Those all around could not help but press against him now, but he found himself the target for ritual apologies: “Your pardon, noble sir. | cannot prevent this discourtesy.” “Pardon, sir; this crush of people is the worst I’ve ever seen.” “I abase myself, holy citizen. A lout shoved me.”\nPaul ignored the words after the first few. There was no feeling in them except a kind of ritual fear. He found himself, instead, thinking that he had come a long way from his boyhood days in Caladan Castle. Where had he put his foot\non the path that led to this journey across a crowded square on a planet so far from Caladan? Had he really put his foot on a path? He could not say he had acted at any point in his life for one specific reason. The motives and impinging forces had been complex—more complex possibly than any other set of goads in human history. He had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid the fate he could see so clearly along this path. But the crowd pushed him forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way, lost personal direction over his life.\nThe crowd flowed with", " worst I’ve ever seen.” “I abase myself, holy citizen. A lout shoved me.”\nPaul ignored the words after the first few. There was no feeling in them except a kind of ritual fear.

He had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid the fate he could see so clearly along this path. But the crowd pushed him forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way, lost personal direction over his life.\nThe crowd flowed with him up the steps now into the temple portico. Voices grew hushed. The smell of fear grew stronger—acrid, sweaty.\nAcolytes had already begun the service within the temple. Their plain chant dominated the other sounds—whispers, rustle of garments, shuffling feet, coughs—telling the story of the Far Places visited by the Priestess in her holy trance.\nShe rides the sandworm of space! She guides through all storms Into the land of gentle winds. Though we sleep by the snake’s den, She guards our dreaming souls. Shunning the desert heat,\nShe hides us in a cool hollow.\nThe gleaming of her white teeth Guides us in the night.\nBy the braids of her hair\nWe are lifted up to heaven! Sweet fragrance, flower-scented, Surrounds us in her presence.\nBalak! Paul thought, thinking in Fremen. Look out! She can be filled with angry passion, too.\nThe temple portico was lined with tall, slender glow-tubes simulating candle flame. They flickered. The flickering stirred ancestral memories in Paul even while he knew that was the intent. This setting was an atavism, subtly contrived, effective. He hated his own hand in it.\nThe crowd flowed with him through tall metal doors into the gigantic nave, a gloomy place with the flickering lights far away overhead, a brilliantly illuminated altar at the far end. Behind the altar, a deceptively simple affair of black wood encrusted with sand patterns from the Fremen mythology, hidden lights played on the field of a pru-door to create a rainbow borealis. The seven rows of chanting acolytes ranked below that spectral curtain took on an eerie quality: black robes, white faces, mouths moving in unison.\nPaul studied the pilgrims around him, suddenly envious of their intentness, their air of listening to truths he could not hear. It seemed to him that they gained something here which was denied to him, something mysteriously healing.\nHe tried to inch his way closer to the altar, was stopped by a hand on his arm. Paul whipped his gaze around, met the probing stare of an ancient Fremen—blue-blue eyes beneath overhanging brows, recognition in them. A name flashed into Paul’s mind: Rasir, a companion from the sietch days.\nIn the press of the crowd, Paul knew he was completely vulnerable if Rasir planned violence.\nThe old man pressed close, one hand beneath a sand- grimed robe—grasping the hilt of a crysknife, no doubt. Paul set himself as best he could to resist attack. The old man moved his head toward Paul’s ear, whispered: “We will go with the others.”\nIt was the signal to identify his guide. Paul nodded.\nRasir drew back, faced the altar.\n“She comes from the east,” the acolytes chanted. “The sun stands at her back. All things are exposed. In the full glare of light—her eyes miss no thing, neither light nor dark.”\nA wailing rebaba jarred across the voices, stilled them, receded into silence. With an electric abruptness, the crowd surged forward several meters. They were packed into a\ntight mass of flesh now, the air heavy with their breathing and the scent of spice. “Shai-hulud writes on clean sand!” the acolytes shouted. Paul felt his own breath catch in unison with those around him. A feminine chorus began singing faintly from the Shadows behind the shimmering pru-door: “Alia... Alia... Alia...” It grew louder and louder, fell to a sudden silence. Again—voices beginning vesper-soft:\nShe stills all storms—\nHer eyes kill our enemies, And torment the unbelievers. From the spires of Tuono Where dawnlight strikes\nAnd clear water runs,\nYou see her shadow.\nIn the shining summer heat She serves us bread and milk— Cool, fragrant with spices.\nHer eyes melt our enemies, Torment our oppressors\nAnd pierce all mysteries.\nShe is Alia... Alia . . . Alia...\nSlowly, the voices trailed off.\nPaul felt sickened. What are we doing? he asked himself. Alia was a child witch, but she was growing older. And he thought: Growing older is to grow more wicked.\nThe collective mental atmosphere of the temple ate at his psyche. He could sense that element of himself which was one with those all around him, but the differences formed a deadly contradiction. He stood immersed, isolated in a personal sin which he could never expiate. The immensity of the universe outside the temple flooded his awareness. How could one man, one ritual, hope to knit such immensity into a garment fitted to all men?\nPaul shuddered.\nThe universe opposed him at every step. It eluded his grasp, conceived countless disguises to delude him. That\nuniverse would never agree with any shape he gave it.\nA profound hush spread through the temple.\nAlia emerged from the darkness behind the shimmering rainbows. She wore a yellow robe trimmed in Atreides green —yellow for sunlight, green for the death which produced life. Paul experienced the sudden surprising thought that Alia had emerged here just for him, for him alone. He stared across the mob in the temple at his sister. She was his sister. He knew her ritual and its roots, but he had never before stood out here with the pilgrims, watched her through their eyes. Here, performing the mystery of this place, he saw that she partook of the universe which opposed him.\nAcolytes brought her a golden chalice.\nAlia raised the chalice.\nWith part of his awareness, Paul knew that the chalice contained the unaltered melange, the subtle poison, her sacrament of the oracle.\nHer gaze on the chalice, Alia sooke. Her voice caressed the ears, flower sound, flowing and musical:\n“In the beginning, we were empty,” she said.\n“Ignorant of all things,” the chorus sang.\n“We did not know the Power that abides in every place,” Alia said.\n“And in every Time,” the chorus sang.\n“Here is the Power,” Alia said, raising the chalice slightly.\n“It brings us joy,” sang the chorus.\nAnd it brings us distress, Paul thought.\n“It awakens the soul,” Alia said.\n“It dispels all doubts,” the chorus sang.\n“In worlds, we perish,” Alia said.\n“In the Power, we survive,” sang the chorus.\nAlia put the chalice to her lips, drank.\nTo his astonishment, Paul found he was holding his breath like the meanest pilgrim of this mob. Despite every shred of personal knowledge about the experience Alia was\nundergoing, he had been caught in the tao-web. He felt himself remembering how that fiery poison coursed into the body. Memory unfolded the time-stopping when awareness became a mote which changed the poison. He reexperienced the awakening into timelessness where all things were possible. He knew Alia’s present experience, yet he saw now that he did not know it. Mystery blinded the eyes.\nAlia trembled, sank to her knees.\nPaul exhaled with the enraptured pilgrims. He nodded. Part of the veil began to lift from him. Absorbed in the bliss of a vision, he had forgotten that each vision belonged to all those who were still on-the-way, still to become. In the vision, one passed through a darkness, unable to distinguish reality from insubstantial accident. One hungered for absolutes which could never be.\nHungering, one lost the present.\nAlia swayed with the rapture of spice change.\nPaul felt that some transcendental presence spoke to him, saying: “Look! See there! See what you’ve ignored?” In that instant, he thought he looked through other eyes, that he Saw an imagery and rhythm in this place which no artist or poet could reproduce. It was vital and beautiful, a glaring light that exposed all power-gluttony ... even his own.\nAlia spoke. Her amplified voice boomed across the nave.\n“Luminous night,” she cried.\nA moan swept like a wave through the crush of pilgrims.\n“Nothing hides in such a night!” Alia said. “What rare light is this darkness? You cannot fix your gaze upon it! Senses cannot record it. No words describe it.” Her voice lowered. “The abyss remains. It is pregnant with all the things yet to be. Ahhhhh, what gentle violence!”\nPaul felt that he waited for some private signal from his sister. It could be any action or word, something of wizardry and mystical processes, an outward streaming that would fit\nhim like an arrow into a cosmic bow. This instant lay like quivering mercury in his awareness.\n“There will be sadness,” Alia intoned. “I remind you that all things are but a beginning, forever beginning. Worlds wait to be conquered. Some within the sound of my voice will attain exalted destinies. You will sneer at the past, forgetting what | tell you now: within all differences there is unity.”\nPaul suppressed a cry of disappointment as Alia lowered her head. She had not said the thing he waited to hear. His body felt like a dry shell, a husk abandoned by some desert insect.\nOthers must feel something similar, he thought. He sensed the restlessness about him. Abruptly, a woman in the mob, someone far down in the nave to Paul’s left, cried out, a wordless noise of anguish.\nAlia lifted her head and Paul had the giddy sensation that the distance between them collapsed, that he stared directly into her glazed eyes only inches away from her.\n“Who summons me?” Alia asked.\n“I do,” the woman cried. “I do, Alia. Oh, Alia, help me. They say my son was killed on Muritan. Is he gone? Will | never see my son again... never?”\n“You try to walk backward in the sand,” Alia intoned. “Nothing is lost. Everything returns later, but you may not recognize the changed form that returns.”\n“Alia, | don’t understand!” the woman wailed.\n“You live in the air but you do not see it,” Alia said, sharpness in her voice. “Are you a lizard? Your voice has the Fremen accent. Does a Fremen try to bring back the dead? What do we need from our dead except their water?”\nDown in the center of the nave, a man in a rich red cloak lifted both hands, the sleeves falling to expose white-clad arms. “Alia,” he shouted, “I have had a business proposal. Should | accept?”\n“You come here like a beggar,” Alia said. “You look for the golden bowl but you will find only a dagger.”\n“I have been asked to kill a man!” a voice shouted from off to the right—a deep voice with si", " in the sand,” Alia intoned. “Nothing is lost. Everything returns later, but you may not recognize the changed form that returns.”\n“Alia, | don’t understand!” the woman wailed.\n“You live in the air but you do not see it,” Alia said, sharpness in her voice. “Are you a lizard? Your voice has the Fremen accent. Does a Fremen try to bring back the dead? What do we need from our dead except their water?”\nDown in the center of the nave, a man in a rich red cloak lifted both hands, the sleeves falling to expose white-clad arms. “Alia,” he shouted, “I have had a business proposal. Should | accept?”\n“You come here like a beggar,” Alia said. “You look for the golden bowl but you will find only a dagger.”\n“I have been asked to kill a man!” a voice shouted from off to the right—a deep voice with sietch tones. “Should | accept? Accepting, would | succeed?”\n“Beginning and end are a single thing,” Alia snapped. “Have | not told you this before? You didn’t come here to ask that question. What is it you cannot believe that you must come here and cry out against it?”\n“She’s in a fierce mood tonight,” a woman near Paul muttered. “Have you ever seen her this angry?”\nShe knows I’m out here, Paul thought. Did she see something in the vision that angered her? Is she raging at me?\n“Alia,” a man directly in front of Paul called. “Tell these businessmen and faint-hearts how long your brother will rule!”\n“| permit you to look around that corner by yourself,” Alia snarled. “You carry your prejudice in your mouth! It is because my brother rides the worm of chaos that you have roof and water!”\nWith a fierce gesture, clutching her robe, Alia whirled away, strode through the shimmering ribbons of light, was lost in the darkness behind.\nImmediately, the acolytes took up the closing chant, but their rhythm was off. Obviously, they’d been caught by the unexpected ending of the rite. An incoherent mumbling arose on all sides of the crowd. Paul felt the stirring around him—restless, dissatisfied.\n“It was that fool with his stupid question about business,” a woman near Paul muttered. “The hypocrite!”\nWhat had Alia seen? What track through the future?\nSomething had happened here tonight, souring the rite of the oracle. Usually, the crowd clamored for Alia to answer their pitiful questions. They came as beggars to the oracle, yes. He had heard them thus many times as he’d watched,\nhidden in the darkness behind the altar. What had been different about this night?\nThe old Fremen tugged Paul’s sleeve, nodded toward the exit. The crowd already was beginning to push in that direction. Paul allowed himself to be pressed along with them, the guide’s hand upon his sleeve. There was the feeling in him then that his body had become the manifestation of some power he could no longer control. He had become a non-being, a stillness which moved itself. At the core of the non-being, there he existed, allowing himself to be led through the streets of his city, following a track so familiar to his visions that it froze his heart with grief.\n| should know what Alia saw, he thought. / have seen it enough times myself. And she didn’t cry out against it... she saw the alternatives, too.\nProduction growth and income growth must not get out of step in my Empire. That is the substance of my command. There are to be no balance- of-payment difficulties between the different spheres of influence. And the reason for this is simply because | command it. | want to emphasize my authority in this area. | am the supreme energy-eater of this domain, and will remain so, alive or dead. My Government is the economy.\n—ORDER IN COUNCIL THE EMPEROR PAUL MUAD’DIB\n44 | will leave you here,” the old man said, taking his hand\nfrom Paul’s sleeve. “It is on the right, second door from the far end. Go with Shai-hulud, Muad’Dib... and remember when you were Usul.”\nPaul’s guide slipped away into the darkness.\nThere would be Security men somewhere out there waiting to grab the guide and take the man to a place of questioning, Paul knew. But Paul found himself hoping the old Fremen would escape.\nThere were stars overhead and the distant light of First Moon somewhere beyond the Shield Wall. But this place was not the open desert where a man could sight on a star to guide his course. The old man had brought him into one of the new suburbs; this much Paul recognized.\nThis street now was thick with sand blown in from encroaching dunes. A dim light glowed from a single public suspensor globe far down the street. It gave enough illumination to show that this was a dead-end street.\nThe air around him was thick with the smell of a reclamation still. The thing must be poorly capped for its fetid odors to escape, loosing a dangerously wasteful amount of moisture into the night air. How careless his people had grown, Paul thought. They were millionaires of water—forgetful of the days when a man on Arrakis could\nhave been killed for just an eighth share of the water in his body.\nWhy am I hesitating? Paul wondered. /t is the second door from the far end. | knew that without being told. But this thing must be played out with precision. So... I hesitate.\nThe noise of an argument arose suddenly from the corner house on Paul’s left. A woman there berated someone: the new wing of their house leaked dust, she complained. Did he think water fell from heaven? If dust came in, moisture got out.\nSome remember, Paul thought.\nHe moved down the street and the quarrel faded away behind.\nWater from heaven! he thought.\nSome Fremen had seen that wonder on other worlds. He had seen it himself, had ordered it for Arrakis, but the memory of it felt like something that had occurred to another person. Rain, it was called. Abruptly, he recalled a rainstorm on his birthworld—clouds thick and gray in the sky of Caladan, an electric storm presence, moist air, the big wet drops drumming on skylights. It ran in rivulets off the eaves. Storm drains took the water away to a river which ran muddy and turgid past the Family orchards. . . trees there with their barren branches glistening wetly.\nPaul’s foot caught in a low drift of sand across the street. For an instant, he felt mud clinging to the shoes of his childhood. Then he was back in the sand, in the dust- clotted, wind-muffled darkness with the Future hanging over him, taunting. He could feel the aridity of life around him like an accusation. You did this! They'd become a civilization of dry-eyed watchers and taletellers, people who solved all problems with power...and more power... and still more power—hating every erg of it.\nRough stones came underfoot. His vision remembered them. The dark rectangle of a doorway appeared on his right—black in black: Otheym’s house, Fate’s house, a place\ndifferent from the ones around it only in the role Time had chosen for it. It was a strange place to be marked down in history.\nThe door opened to his knock. The gap revealed the dull green light of an atrium. A dwarf peered out, ancient face on a child’s body, an apparition prescience had never seen.\n“You've come then,” the apparition said. The dwarf stepped aside, no awe in his manner, merely the gloating of a slow smile. “Come in! Come in!”\nPaul hesitated. There’d been no dwarf in the vision, but all else remained identical. Visions could contain such disparities and still hold true to their original plunge into infinity. But the difference dared him to hope. He glanced back up the street at the creamy pearl glistening of his moon swimming out of jagged shadows. The moon haunted him. How did it fall?\n“Come in,” the dwarf insisted.\nPaul entered, heard the door thud into its moisture seals behind. The dwarf passed him, led the way, enormous feet Slapping the floor, opened the delicate lattice gate into the roofed central courtyard, gestured. “They await, Sire.”\nSire, Paul thought. He knows me, then.\nBefore Paul could explore this discovery, the dwarf Slipped away down a side passage. Hope was a dervish wind whirling, dancing in Paul. He headed across the courtyard. It was a dark and gloomy place, the smell of sickness and defeat in it. He felt daunted by the atmosphere. Was it defeat to choose a lesser evil? he wondered. How far down this track had he come?\nLight poured from a narrow doorway in the far wall. He put down the feeling of watchers and evil smells, entered the doorway into a small room. It was a barren place by Fremen standards with hiereg hangings on only two walls. Opposite the door, a man sat on carmine cushions beneath the best hanging. A feminine figure hovered in shadows behind another doorway in a barren wall to the left.\nPaul felt vision-trapped. This was the way it’d gone. Where was the dwarf? Where was the difference?\nHis senses absorbed the room in a single gestalten sweep. The place had received painstaking care despite its poor furnishings. Hooks and rods across the barren walls showed where hangings had been removed. Pilgrims paid enormous prices for authentic Fremen artifacts, Paul reminded himself. Rich pilgrims counted desert tapestries as treasures, true marks of a hajj.\nPaul felt that the barren walls accused him with their fresh gypsum wash. The threadbare condition of the two remaining hangings amplified the sense of guilt.\nA narrow shelf occupied the wall on his right. It held a row of portraits—mostly bearded Fremen, some in stillsuits with their catchtubes dangling, some in Imperial uniforms posed against exotic offworld backgrounds. The most common scene was a seascape.\nThe Fremen on cushions cleared his throat, forcing Paul to look at him. It was Otheym precisely as the vision had revealed him: neck grown scrawny, a bird thing which appeared too weak to support the large head. The face was a lopsided ruin—networks of crisscrossed scars on the left cheek below a drooping, wet eye, but clear skin on the other side and a Straight, blue-in-blue Fremen gaze. A long kedge of a nose bisected the face.\nOtheym’s cushion sat in the center of a threadbare rug, brown with maroon and gold threads. The cushion fabric betrayed splotches of wear and patching, but every bit of metal around the seated figure shone from polishing—the portrait frames, shelf lip and brackets, the pedestal of a low table on the right.\nPaul nodded to the clear half of Otheym’s face, said: “Good luck to you and your dwelling place.” It was the greeting of an old friend and sietch mate.\n“So | see you once more, Usul.”\nThe voice speaking his tribal name whined with an old man’s quavering. The dull drooping eye on the ruined side of the face moved above the parchment skin and scars. Gray bristles stubbled that side and the jawline there hung with scabrous peelings. Otheym’s mouth twisted as he spoke, the gap exposing silvery metal teeth.\n“Muad’Dib always answers the call of a Fedaykin,” Paul said.\nThe woman in the doorway shadows moved, said: “So Stilgar boasts.”\n"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_19f3af4a256db6cefb0f0bb8ef93596f51b40a0b786963dc936da9d119e17337_v2"}
