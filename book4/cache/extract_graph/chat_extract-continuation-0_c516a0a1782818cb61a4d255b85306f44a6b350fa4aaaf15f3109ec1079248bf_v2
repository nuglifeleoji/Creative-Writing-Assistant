\n　　他进入本区队办公室后，看见房子里已经涌满了人。人不要排队，由自己的私章在办事员的桌子上排队。少平把自己的章子放在桌上的那一条长蛇阵后面，然后看着办事员不断用剪子剪开一捆捆新票子的封条。 \n　　前面有两个新工人，一个领了十八元，一个领了二十元。蹲在旁边的雷区长对他们说：“你们这月吃球呀？不好好下井，裤衩都要卖得吃了！甭看矿井是黑口口，很公正！钻得多了钱就多，在地面上瞎逛球毛都没一根！不上工，就是你爸当矿长，也是这两个钱！” \n　　那两个新工人垂着脑袋悄悄退出了人群。 \n　　这时，办事员拿起少平的章子在工资表上压了一下，便给他扔过来一摞子钱。 \n　　少平连点也没点，揣在怀里就走出了区队办公室，穿过楼道，来到外面。 \n　　飘飘洒洒的雪花象无数只白蝴蝶在天地间飞舞。矿区的黑色无踪无影，和周围山野连成一片银白。 \n　　往日喧嚣的大牙湾宁静下来，充满了某种肃穆的气氛。孙少平踏着松软的荒雪，穿过马路，径直走向那个他早已打算过的地方。他来到邮政所，他是来寄钱的。除留够本月伙食和买一床铺盖的钱外，他还剩五十元。他要把这钱寄给父亲。 \n　　这是一个庄严的时刻。是的，这是他正式参加工作后第一个月的工资。他能想象来，这张汇款单出现在双水村将意味着什么。他似乎看见，父亲是怎样捏着那张纸片走进了石圪节邮政所墨绿色的大门。 \n　　孙少平用一分钱买了一张汇款单，然后伏在柜台上开始填写。圆珠笔在他手里微微地抖着。当他在收款人栏里一笔一划写上“刘玉厚”三个字的时候，止不住的泪水已经模糊了他的双眼…… \n                  第5章\n　　经过漫长的冬天和短暂的春天，荒凉的黄土高原又渐渐进入了它一年中最为美好的季节。 \n　　五月初，立夏前后，山野里的草木大部分都发芽出叶，连绵的山峦染上了一片片鲜绿嫩青。太阳开始有了热力，暖洋洋地照耀着广袤的大地。河流水泊清澈碧澄，映照出初夏的蓝天和蓝天上悠悠的白云彩。 \n　　一九八二年，整个黄土高原全部实行了生产责任制。这块饱经沧桑的古老土地进入了它新的历史时期。各种政权机构也由多年来一元化的革命委员会演变成了党政分家的局面。县以上重建了人大，和党委、政府一起被俗称为“三套班子”。举世闻名的人民公社先后被乡政府所取代。“革命”留下的许多遗产正�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
