洗了，晾在草地上，自己赤裸裸地躺在沙丘上晒太阳；望着蓝天上悠悠的白云，无限止地回想那个遥远的地方和那个不知去向的姑娘……春天的沙漠依然和冬天一样荒凉。天地被风沙搅成灰漠漠一片。太阳象一面水银剥落的破镜子。没有花朵，没有绿色，所有的海子上都漂着大块的浮冰。 \n　　金波开着汽车，在这条既熟悉又陌生的道路上颠簸着行驶。天已经接近黄昏。远处隐约地出现了一个黑点。那看来是辆汽车。好稀罕！半天才碰上一辆。但那个黑点似乎一直没有移动。毫无疑问，这辆车“抛锚”了。车坏在沙漠里可是件头疼事，能把人活活急死！按照惯例，沙漠里所有过路的汽车，都有责任帮助一辆不能动弹的汽车——这是严酷的环境迫使人遵从的一条准则；因为谁都可能碰上这种倒霉事！金波把车开到这辆坏车处，就停了下来。 \n　　下车以后，他才惊讶地看见，原来这辆车是李向前和润生开的——这可碰了个巧！ \n　　润生和他姐夫在困境中看见他，就象看见了援兵，亲热地过来拉住了他的手。 \n　　“哪儿坏了？”金波问向前，他和向前不熟悉，但认识，也知道他和润叶姐过不到一块的事。 \n　　“还没找见毛病……可能是油路出了毛病。”向前搓着两只肮脏的手，着急地说。 \n　　金波虽然是个新手，但不管行不行，也就过去和他们一块寻找起“毛病”来了。 \n　　三个人一直弄到半夜，才把向前的车修好。他们都已经很累，就决定先在驾驶楼里迷糊到天明再走。 \n　　向前拿出一瓶酒，硬要和金波喝一轮子。润生不喝酒，就先到金波的驾驶楼里睡觉去了。 \n　　金波和向前两个人坐在这面的驾驶楼里，嘴对酒瓶子，一人一口喝起来。驾驶楼外面，遒劲的蒙古风在吼叫着，大地虽然不是一团漆黑，但什么也看不清楚。两个人静静地喝着酒，醉眼朦胧地透过挡风玻璃，望着外面混混沌沌的荒野。“你成家了没？”向前灌了一口烧酒，长长地吹了一口气，问金波。 \n　　“没。”金波捉住向前递过的酒瓶，也灌了一口。“有没有对象？” \n　　“没。” \n　　“没了好……女人啊……”向前灌了一大口酒。 \n　　金波沉默地仰靠在椅座上，感到胸口烧烘烘的。“女人是酒，让你迷迷糊糊……”向前也确实有点迷糊了。“女人又是水，象中学化学书上说的，无色无味无情无义……” \n　　金波仍然沉默不语。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
