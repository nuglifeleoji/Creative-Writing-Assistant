It gained notoriety as the location where a victim's corpse was discovered by **菊池道广 (Michihiro Kikuchi)** during their game. The building is also the site where **桐原的父亲 (Kirihara's father)** was stabbed to death, a case that remains unsolved.  \n\nInitially serving as a construction site with temporary offices, the building was later abandoned, becoming a decaying and isolated structure. It is most prominently linked to two tragic incidents: the discovery of an unidentified victim's body and the unresolved murder of Kirihara's father. The repeated references to the victim's body being found there suggest it may have been used as a hiding place or dumping ground for criminal activities. Despite its grim history, the exact circumstances surrounding these events—including whether they are connected—remain unclear.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively paint the **废弃大楼** as a forsaken location marked by violence and mystery, with its past as a functional space overshadowed by its later association with death and unsolved crimes.\",6\n29,通风管,\"The **通风管 (ventilation pipe)** serves multiple symbolic and functional roles in the narrative. It is a literal pathway used by **桐原亮司 (Kirihara Ryouji)** to navigate and hide, reflecting his secretive and isolated existence. Additionally, it acts as a conduit for his voyeuristic actions, specifically as the channel through which he observes his father and **雪穗 (Yukiho)**.  \n\nThe ventilation pipe is also tied to the abandoned building where a victim's body is discovered. It forms part of the ventilation shaft system that local children repurposed as a playground, underscoring the juxtaposition of innocence and darkness in the story. The pipe's dual role—as both a hidden passage for Ryouji and a site of grim discovery—highlights its significance as a space where secrecy, trauma, and tragedy intersect.  \n\nDespite differing emphases (personal use by Ryouji vs. communal use by children), the descriptions coalesce around the **通风管** as a critical, multi-functional element within the abandoned building, bridging individual and collective experiences of concealment and revelation. The contradictions are resolved by framing the pipe as a shared yet fragmented space, serving different purposes for different characters while remaining central to the narrative's tension.  \n\n(Word count: 198)\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n33,废弃大楼,谋杀案,\"废弃大楼 serves as the primary crime scene where the murder occurred.\n废弃大楼 is the crime scene where the victim's body was discovered.\",14\n32,通风管,废弃大楼,\"通风管 is part of the废弃大楼 where the victim was found.\n通风管 is the structural feature of废弃大楼 where children discovered the victim.\",10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
