看到了在办公桌的一只拉开的大抽屉，里面满满地放着一袋袋方便面，这时孩子们才想起自己已饿得厉害，就走过去各自撕开一袋方便面卡吧卡吧地吃起来。华华又看到了墙角有一个自动热水器，就拿了一个杯子接了一杯水，那水还是热的。吃完了以后，他们又在房间中翻找起来，在床上的枕头下面找到了一个手电筒。孩子们正要从进来的那个门出去时，发现房间里还有一个小门，他们打开那个小门后，谅讶地看到外面就是通讯中心大厅！ 这又是在大屏幕上开的一个门，他们走过去把门关上后，门的一面立刻成为屏幕半透明的一部分，结合处连缝都看不出来。\n　　孩子们再次从大厅中走出，继续寻找下去的楼梯，他们在手电光中找遍了整个走廊，又发现了一个厕所，但除了电梯外没有找到任何出口，那两个电梯是从这个巨型建筑顶端下去的唯一通路。\n　　“碰开电梯的门！”华华挥了一下手电说。\n　　“咱们就是进去了，它还是动不了呀。”\n　　“把电梯的底再弄开个口子。”\n　　“干什么？”\n　　“那电梯是斜着升上来的，它的轨道也一定是斜的，咱们顺着那轨道滑下去！”\n　　“胡说八道，那真是疯了！”\n　　“其实那很容易的，在学校我们常常从楼梯的扶手上往下滑，一点都不费劲儿，我敢说你也能行，真的！”\n　　“可……现在这里还有那么多的方便面，够咱们吃好几天的，咱们干嘛那么着急下去呢？ 咱们再等等。”\n　　“有什么可等的？永远不会有电了。唉——”\n　　“可下面……下面能有什么呢？”\n　　是啊，下面能有什么呢？下去又怎么样？\n　　华华放弃了他那疯狂的计划，和小梦一起又回到了中心大厅。他们把大厅和走廊中那五个死去的人远远地抬到走廊的另一端的电梯门口，这项工作使孩子们精神近于崩溃，但他们还是干完了。他们在关上中心大厅的门以前用手电朝走廊的另一头照了一下，看到那五个没有生命的躯体已被滚滚的蒸汽吞没了\n　　通讯中心大厅十分安静，那四面巨大的屏幕象四块半透明的宝石，把这里和外部世界隔开了，在这个人类历史上最可怕的时刻，两个孩子总算找到了一个可以呆下来的地方。\n\n　　六、玫瑰星云\n\n　　两个孩子靠在一起坐在大厅的地板上，他们面前是那面已变成透明落地窗的大屏幕，透过它可以看得很远。下面是北京的建筑群，再往远处是一道山脉，看不清山的细节，它只是一道呈均匀深蓝色的屏障。山脉只占了一半视野，另一半是黄绿色的\n######################\nOutput:",
