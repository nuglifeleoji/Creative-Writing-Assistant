便觉左足阴阴疼痛，心中大疑。唤关平至，以梦告之。平对曰：“猪亦有龙象。龙附足，乃升腾之意，不必疑忌。”云长聚多官于帐下，告以梦兆。或言吉祥者，或言不祥者，众论不一。云长曰：“吾大丈夫，年近六旬，即死何憾！”正言间，蜀使至，传汉中王旨，拜云长为前将军，假节钺，都督荆襄九郡事。云长受命讫，众官拜贺曰：“此足见猪龙之瑞也。”于是云长坦然不疑，遂起兵奔襄阳大路而来。\n\n    曹仁正在城中，忽报云长自领兵来。仁大惊，欲坚守不出，副将翟元曰：“今魏王令将军约会东吴取荆州；今彼自来，是送死也，何故避之！”参谋满宠谏曰：“吾素知云长勇而有谋，未可轻敌。不如坚守，乃为上策。”骁将夏侯存曰：“此书生之言耳。岂不闻水来土掩，将至兵迎？我军以逸待劳，自可取胜。”曹仁从其言，令满宠守樊城，自领兵来迎云长。\n\n    云长知曹兵来，唤关平、廖化二将，受计而往。与曹兵两阵对圆，廖化出马搦战。翟元出迎。二将战不多时，化诈败，拨马便走，翟元从后追杀，荆州兵退二十里。次日，又来搦战。夏侯存、翟元一齐出迎，荆州兵又败，又追杀二十余里。忽听得背后喊声大震，鼓角齐鸣。曹仁急命前军速回，背后关平、廖化杀来，曹兵大乱。曹仁知是中计，先掣一军飞奔襄阳；离城数里，前面绣旗招飐，云长勒马横刀，拦住去路。曹仁胆战心惊，不敢交锋，望襄阳斜路而走。云长不赶。须臾，夏侯存军至，见了云长，大怒，便与云长交锋，只一合，被云长砍死。翟元便走，被关平赶上，一刀斩之。乘势追杀，曹兵大半死于襄江之中。曹仁退守樊城。\n\n    云长得了襄阳，赏军抚民。随军司马王甫曰：“将军一鼓而下襄阳，曹兵虽然丧胆，然以愚意论之：今东吴吕蒙屯兵陆口，常有吞并荆州之意；倘率兵径取荆州，如之奈何？”云长曰：“吾亦念及此。汝便可提调此事：去沿江上下，或二十里，或三十里，选高阜处置一烽火台，每台用五十军守之；倘吴兵渡江，夜则明火，昼则举烟为号。吾当亲往击之。”王甫曰：“糜芳、傅士仁守二隘口，恐不竭力；必须再得一人以总督荆州。”云长曰：“吾已差治中潘浚守之，有何虑焉\n######################\nOutput:",
