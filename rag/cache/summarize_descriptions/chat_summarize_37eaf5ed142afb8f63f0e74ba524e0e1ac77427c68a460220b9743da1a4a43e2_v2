It is the site where **Duncan Idaho** undergoes reawakening, marking a pivotal moment in his journey. The NO-GLOBE also functions as a refuge for **Duncan**, **Miles Teg**, and **Lucilla**, who reside there in isolation, cut off from the outside world and its temporal flow. The facility is filled with preserved artifacts, suggesting it may have been repurposed or maintained over time for clandestine operations.  \n\nLocated in a remote area, the NO-GLOBE is near where **Burzmali** establishes his command post, indicating its tactical importance. The facility's shielded nature makes it an ideal hiding spot, allowing its occupants to evade detection. At one point, **Teg**, **Duncan**, and **Lucilla** emerge from the NO-GLOBE into a cold night, further emphasizing its secluded and controlled environment.  \n\nIn summary, the NO-GLOBE is a multifunctional Harkonnen stronghold—serving as a reawakening site, a temporal refuge, and a strategic hideout—while remaining concealed from external forces. Its isolation and preservation of artifacts suggest long-term significance in the broader conflict.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251852, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 264, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 541, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 213}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
