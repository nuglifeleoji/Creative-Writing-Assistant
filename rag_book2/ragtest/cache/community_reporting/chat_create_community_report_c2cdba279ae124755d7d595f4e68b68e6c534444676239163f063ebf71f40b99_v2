The service provided Noriko with introductions to six potential male partners, though none ultimately resulted in a successful match. Additionally, the 婚介所 served as the platform where Noriko submitted her personal details, which may have been accessed by 秋吉 (Akihoshi) through the Memorix system. This suggests that the service not only facilitated introductions but also potentially exposed users' data to third-party access.  \n\nIn summary, the 婚介所 functioned as both a matchmaking intermediary and a repository of personal information, connecting individuals like Noriko and Tamotsu while also presenting privacy risks due to possible unauthorized data access. Despite its efforts to arrange introductions, it did not lead to a lasting partnership for Noriko.
