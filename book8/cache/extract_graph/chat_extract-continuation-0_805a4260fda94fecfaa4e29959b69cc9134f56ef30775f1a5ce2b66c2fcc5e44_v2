银纹蓝银草后拉，强行把刘锋从空中拉了回来，但此时他却已经是脸色苍白，双手户口破裂，鲜血直流。眼看是没什么战斗力了。\n------------\n\n第八十九章 银纹蓝银草的辅助召唤\n\n    但是，两枚火球被击退，总算是给钱磊争取到了足够的时间。\n\n    “你靠谱点啊！”刘锋忍着手腕上的疼痛，向钱磊叫道。百分之三十的痛感也并不弱啊！\n\n    “还要一小下。”钱磊一脸的无奈。\n\n    就在这时，又是一枚火球飞来。\n\n    “轰——”冰刺终于炸裂，不仅如此，那火球竟是连珠，后面还跟上一枚，直奔三人而来。\n\n    钱磊终于弹起了手中的召唤金钱，开始了他今天的第二次召唤。\n\n    蓝轩宇面对火球，当机立断，右手金纹蓝银草反卷覆盖，一层淡金色光芒顿时从他体内浮现而出。双臂交叉在身前，硬挡！\n\n    他当然可以闪开，可是，他如果闪开了，后面正在施展召唤之门的钱磊却没办法避开啊！召唤被打断，他们就一点机会都没有了。\n\n    “轰——”火球狠狠的撞击在蓝轩宇身上，蓝轩宇只觉得全身一热，左臂又是一凉，一股冰层浮现，和右手金纹蓝银草释放的防御溶为一体，勉强化解了炽热，但他的身体还是被炸的倒飞而出。\n\n    不好。\n\n    可是，现在他已经控制不住自己了，顿时和身后正在召唤的钱磊撞在一起。\n\n    完了……\n\n    无论是钱磊、蓝轩宇还是刘锋，在这一刻都下意识的觉得，完蛋了。召唤过程虽然不长，但也不能被打断的。\n\n    但是，就在蓝轩宇和钱磊碰撞在一起的同时，诡异的一幕出现了，钱磊并没有被蓝轩宇撞开，而蓝轩宇的身体，一半是撞击在了那召唤之门门边上的。他下意识的用覆盖着银纹蓝银草的左手就抓住了那召唤之门的门框。\n\n    诡异的一幕出现了，蓝轩宇只觉得自己的精神似乎恍惚了一下，在那一刹那，他的眼眸深处瞳孔中央多了一点针尖大小的银芒，银芒一闪而过，而也就在那一瞬，整个召唤之门在他的意识中仿佛凝固了一下，似乎自己的气息和那召唤之门的气息之间出现了一种奇异的联系。\n\n    只是联系而已，蓝轩宇并没有感觉到自己失去什么，而也就在那一瞬间，召唤完成。\n\n    火球连珠发射，让三头百年熔岩犬也停顿了一下，但没有了冰刺的保护，众多十年熔岩犬直接冲了上来。\n\n    蓝轩宇用身体挡住火球给钱磊争取时间的一幕�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIU FENG<|>PERSON<|>Liu
