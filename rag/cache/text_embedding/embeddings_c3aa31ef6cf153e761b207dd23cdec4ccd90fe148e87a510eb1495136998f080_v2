from killing you, frees you from\nyour bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?”\nShe lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him. “You may go now, Thufir.”\nThe old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon beneath his tunic. He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Duke’s father (who'd been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida long ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and confused. The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns, cape thrown flamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down from the stands.\nl am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thought. He withdrew his hand from the weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.\nAnd he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never forget this moment nor lose this sense of Supreme admiration for the Lady Jessica.\nQuietly, he turned and left the room.\nJessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and stared at the closed door.\n“Now we'll see some proper action,” she whispered.\nDo you wrestle with dreams?

Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness. A Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke arrived from his command post.\nThe note read: “A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.”\nThere was no signature.\nWhat does it mean? he wondered.\nThe messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be questioned. He had Slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.\nLeto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat later. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath. The antifatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had\nbeen a long two days since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.\nOn top of all the military problems, there’d been the disquieting session with Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.\nShould | waken Jessica? he wondered. There’s no reason to play the secrecy game with her any longer. Or is there?\nBlast and damn that Duncan Idaho!\nHe shook his head. No, not Duncan. | was wrong not to take Jessica into my confidence from the first. | must do it now, before more damage is done.\nThe decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.\nAt the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put his left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand. The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange sound had sent a chill through him.\nSoftly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate illumination. The smallest of Suspensors had been spaced about eight meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone walls swallowed the light.\nA dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.\nLeto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that would limit his movements,\nhis hearing...and because the captured shipment of lasguns had left him filled with doubts.\nSilently, he moved toward the gray blob, saw that it was a human figure, a man face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent close in the dim light to see the face. It was the Smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain down his chest. The dead eyes stared with empty darkness. Leto touched the stain—warm.\nHow could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?\nThe mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator for the house.\nHand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke Skirted the body, slipped down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.\nAnother gray blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at once this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward him with painful slowness, gasping, mumbling.\nLeto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage, crouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the Fremen housekeeper, her hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side. He touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes black-shadowed emptiness.\n“S’you,” she gasped. “Killed...guard...sent...get... Tuek...escape...m’Lady...you...you...here...no....” She flopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.\nLeto felt for pulse at the temples. There was none. He looked at the stain: she’d been stabbed in the back. Who? His mind raced. Did she mean someone had killed a guard? And Tuek—had Jessica sent for him? Why?\nHe started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand toward the shield switch—too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm aside. He felt pain there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it up his arm. It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the passage.\nYueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected yellow from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door. There was stillness from the room behind him—no sound of generators.\nYueh! Leto thought. He’s sabotaged the house generators! We’re wide open!\nYueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.\nLeto found he could still speak, gasped: “Yueh! How?” Then the paralysis reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the stone wall.\nYueh’s face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto’s forehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote...dull.\n“The drug on the dart Is selective,” Yueh said. “You can speak, but I’d advise against it.” He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the dart clattering on the stones was faint and distant to the Duke’s ears.\nIt can’t be Yueh, Leto thought. He’s conditioned.\n“How?” Leto whispered.\n“I’m sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater demands than this.” He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead. “I find it very strange, myself—an override on my pyretic conscience—but | wish to kill a man. Yes, | actually wish it. | will stop at nothing to do it.”\nHe looked down at the Duke. “Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron Harkonnen. | wish to kill the Baron.”\n“Bar...On Har....”\n“Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven’t much time. That peg tooth I put in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal—that tooth must be replaced. In a moment, l'Il render you unconscious and replace that tooth.” He opened his hand, stared at something in it. “An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve. It’ll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you bite down hard on it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your breath sharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas—most deadly.”\nLeto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man’s eyes, the perspiration along brow and chin.\n“You were dead anyway, my poor Duke,” Yueh said. “But you will get close to the Baron before you die. He'll believe you’re stupefied by drugs beyond any dying effort to attack him. And you will be drugged—and tied. But attack can take strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth, Duke Leto Atreides. You will remember the tooth.”\nThe old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache dominated Leto’s narrowing vision.\n“The tooth,” Yueh muttered.\n“Why?” Leto whispered.\nYueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. “I made a shaitan’s bargain with the Baron. And | must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it. When I see him, l'Il Know. When I look at the Baron, then | will know. But l'Il never enter his presence without the price. You’re the price, my poor Duke. And l'Il Know when I see him. My poor Wanna taught me many things, and one is to see certainty of truth when the stress is great. | cannot do it always, but when | see the Baron—then, | wi// know.”\nLeto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh’s hand. He felt this was happening in a nightmare—it could not be.\nYueh’s purple lips turned up in a grimace. “lIl not get close enough to the Baron, or I’d do this myself. No. l'Il be detained at a safe distance. But you...ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He'll want you close to him—to gloat over you, to boast a little.”\nLeto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yueh’s jaw. The muscle twisted\nwhen the man spoke.\nYueh leaned closer. “And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must remember this tooth.” He held it up between thumb and forefinger. “It will be all that remains to you.”\nLeto’s mouth moved without sound, then: “Refuse.”\n“Ah-h, no! You mustn’t refuse. Because, in return for this small service, I’m doing a thing for you. | will Save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.”\n“How...Ssave...them?” Leto whispered.\n“By making it appear they’re dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.” He touched Leto’s jaw. “Can you feel anything in your jaw?”\nThe Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh’s hand come up with the ducal signet ring.\n“For Paul,” Yueh said. “You'll be unconscious presently.", " then: “Refuse.”\n“Ah-h, no! You mustn’t refuse. Because, in return for this small service, I’m doing a thing for you. | will Save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.”\n“How...Ssave...them?” Leto whispered.\n“By making it appear they’re dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.” He touched Leto’s jaw. “Can you feel anything in your jaw?”\nThe Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh’s hand come up with the ducal signet ring.\n“For Paul,” Yueh said. “You'll be unconscious presently. Goodbye, my poor Duke. When next we meet we'll have no time for conversation.”\nCool remoteness spread upward from Leto’s jaw, across his cheeks. The shadowy hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh’s purple lips centered in it.\n“Remember the tooth!” Yueh hissed. “The tooth!”\nThere should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the\nstillness around her. She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish. Skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt...strange.\nLump-lump-lump-lump!\nIt was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere.\nThe waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needlestick movements.\nShe began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a gag in her mouth. She was on her side, hands tied behind her. She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled.\nAnd now, she remembered.\nThere had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her. She had gasped—one indrawn breath—sensing the narcotic in the wetness. Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.\nIt has come, she thought. How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All it took was treachery. Hawat was right.\nShe forced herself not to pull on her bindings.\nThis is not my bedroom, she thought. They’ve taken me someplace else.\nSlowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.\nShe grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear.\nWhere is Paul? she asked herself. My son—what have they done to him?\nCalmness.\nShe forced herself to it, using the ancient routines.\nBut terror remained so near.\nLeto? Where are you, Leto?\nShe sensed a diminishing in the dark.

Around them, she recognized the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side—empty. Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.\nShe looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spider- black eyes.\n“The drug was timed,” he rumbled. “We knew to the minute when you’d be coming out of it.”\nHow could that be? she wondered. They’d have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my.... Yueh!\n“Such a pity you must remain gagged,” the Baron said. “We could have such an interesting conversation.”\nYueh’s the only one it could be, she thought. How?\nThe Baron glanced behind him at the door. “Come in, Piter.”\nShe had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but the face was known— and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She studied him—hawk features, blue-ink eyes that\nsuggested he was a native of Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his flesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy.\n“Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica,” the Baron said. “However, I’m aware of your abilities.” He glanced at the Mentat. “Isn’t that true, Piter?”\n“AS you say, Baron,” the man said.\nThe voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the voice screamed: Killer!\n“I have a surprise for Piter,” the Baron said. “He thinks he has come here to collect his reward—you, Lady Jessica. But | wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.”\n“You play with me, Baron?” Piter asked, and he smiled.\nSeeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend himself from this Piter. Then She corrected herself. The Baron could not read that smile. He did not have the Training.\n“In many ways, Piter is quite naive,” the Baron said. “He doesn’t admit to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I’d show him, but it'd be a foolish risk.” The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting mask. “I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power.”\n“You promised | could have her,” Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve.\nJessica heard the clue-tones in the man’s voice, allowed herself an inward shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?\n“I give you a choice, Piter,” the Baron said.\n“What choice?”\nThe Baron snapped fat fingers. “This woman and exile from the Imperium, or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.”\nJessica watched the Baron’s spider eyes study Piter.\n“You could be Duke here in all but name,” the Baron said.\nIs my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.\nThe Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. “Understand yourself, Piter. You want her because She was a Duke’s woman, a symbol of his power— beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That’s more than a symbol; that’s the reality. With it you could have many women...and more.”\n“You do not joke with Piter?”\nThe Baron turned with that dancing lightness the Suspensors gave him. “Joke? I? Remember—/ am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the lad’s training. They are alike, this mother and son—deadly.” The Baron smiled. “I must go now. | will send in the guard I’ve reserved for this moment. He’s stone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He'll not permit you to untie her gag until you're off\nArrakis. If you choose not to leave...he has other orders.”\n“You don’t have to leave,” Piter said. “I’ve chosen.”\n“Ah, hah!” the Baron chortled. “Such quick decision can mean only one thing.”\n“I will take the duchy,” Piter said.\nAnd Jessica thought: Doesn’t Piter know the Baron’s lying to him? But—how could he know? He’s a twisted Mentat.\nThe Baron glanced down at Jessica. “Is it not wonderful that | know Piter so well? | wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter’s choice. Hah! Well, | leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady Jessica? | had no rancor toward you. It’s a necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And l’ve not actually ordered you destroyed. When it’s asked of me what happened to you, I can Shrug it off in all truth.”\n“You leave it to me then?” Piter asked.\n“The guard | send you will take your orders,” the Baron said. “Whatever's done | leave to you.” He Stared at Piter. “Yes. There will be no blood on my hands here. It’s your decision. Yes. | know nothing of it. You will wait until I’ve gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well...ah, yes. Yes. Good.”\nHe fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah- h-h-h, my poor Leto.\nWith one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She followed him with her eyes, thinking: /t’s as the Reverend Mother warned—too potent an adversary.\nTwo Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.\nThe deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron Knows I could use the Voice on any other man.\nScarface looked at Piter. “We’ve the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?”\nPiter spoke to Jessica. “I’d thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but | begin to see that would not have worked. | let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: “Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found.”\n“You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?” Scarface asked.\nHe reads lips, Jessica thought.\n“I follow my Baron’s example,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor said.”\nJessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.\nPiter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he", " the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?”\nPiter spoke to Jessica. “I’d thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but | begin to see that would not have worked. | let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: “Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy.

Their bodies must never be found.”\n“You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?” Scarface asked.\nHe reads lips, Jessica thought.\n“I follow my Baron’s example,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor said.”\nJessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.\nPiter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out without turning.\n“Me, | wouldn’t like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this night’s work,” Scarface said.\n“You ain’t likely ever to run into that old witch,” one of the other troopers said. He went around to Jessica’s head, bent over her. “It ain’t getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and—”\n“Why’n’t we kill ’em here?” Scarface asked.\n“Too messy,” the first one said. “Unless you wants to strangle ’em. Me, | likes a nice straightforward job. Drop ’em on the desert like that traitor said, cut ’em once or twice, leave the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up afterwards.”\n“Yeah...well, | guess you’re right,” Scarface said.\nJessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.\nScarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor- buoyed litter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter, she saw her companion’s face—Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.\nIs he drugged? she wondered.\nThe troopers lifted the litter, and Paul’s eyes opened the smallest fraction—dark slits staring at her.\nHe mustn't try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!\nPaul’s eyes closed.\nHe had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.\nPaul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother’s face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though.\nHe wondered who could've captured her. His own captivity was plain enough—to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it —a Suk doctor a traitor.\nThe litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A ’thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground.\nPaul’s eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the ‘thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.\n“This the ‘thopter we're supposed to use?” he asked, and turned to watch his companion’s lips.\n“It’s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,” the other said.\nScarface nodded. “But—it’s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain’t room in there for more’n them an’\ntwo of us.”\n“Two’s enough,” said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading. “We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.”\n“The Baron, he told me to make sure what happened to them two,” Scarface said.\n“What you so worried about?” asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer.\n“She is a Bene Gesserit witch,” the deaf one said. “They have powers.”\n“Ah-h-h....” The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. “One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.”\nThe trooper behind him grunted. “She'll be worm meat soon enough. Don’t suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?” He nudged the litter-bearer.\n“Yee-up,” the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica’s shoulders. “C’mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens.”\n“It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,” Scarface said.\nJessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning —stars. She was pushed into the rear of the 'thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope.\nScarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat.\nKinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The ‘thopter took off in a wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his companion’s shoulder, said: “Whyn’t you turn around and keep an eye on them two?”\n“Sure you know the way to go?” Kinet watched Czigo’s lips.\n“I listened to the traitor same’s you.”\nKinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of Starlight on a lasgun in his hand. The ‘thopter’s light- walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guard’s scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would Snap at a sudden jerk.\nHas someone been at this ’thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul’s.\n“Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this,” Scarface said. “You ever have any highborn types?” He turned to look at the pilot.\n“Bene Gesserit ain’t all highborn,” the pilot said.\n“But they all looks heighty.”\nHe can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.\n“Real pretty, she is,” Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. “Sure do seem a shame.” He looked at Czigo.\n“You thinking what I think you’re thinking?” the pilot asked.\n“Who'd be to know?” the guard asked. “Afterwards....” He shrugged. “I just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again.”\n“You lay a hand on my mother....” Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.\n“Hey!” the pilot laughed. “Cub’s got a bark. Ain’t got no bite, though.”\nAnd Jessica thought: Paul’s pitching his voice too high. It may work, though.\nThey flew on in silence.\nThese poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron’s words. They'll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.\nThe ‘thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.\n“This oughta be far enough,” the pilot said. “The traitor said to put ’em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.” He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.\nJessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn’t mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails....\nThe ‘thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, Saw a Shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.\nSomeone’s following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there’ll\nbe watchers for the watchers, too.\nCzigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.\nJessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.\nPaul cleared his throat.\nThe pilot said: “Now, Kinet?”\n“| dunno, Czigo.”\nCzigo turned, said: “Ah-h-h, look.” He reached out for Jessica’s skirt.\n“Remove her gag,” Paul commanded.\nJessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent—imperative, very sharp. A Slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man’s spectrum.\nCzigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica’s mouth, slipped the knot on the gag.\n“Stop that!” Kinet ordered.\n“Ah, shut your trap,” Czigo said. “Her hands’re tied.” He freed the knot and the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.\nKinet put a hand on the pilot’s arm. “Look, Czigo, no need to....”\nJessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. “Gentlemen! No need to fight over me.” At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet’s benefit.\nShe saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over\nher. Their disagreement required no other reason. In their minds, they were fighting over her.\nShe held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: “You mustn’t disagree.” They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other. “Is any woman worth fighting over?” she asked.\nBy uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.\nPaul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now—everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.\n“Yeah,” Scarface said. “No need to fight over....”\nHis hand flashed toward the pilot’s neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet’s chest.\nScarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.\n“Thought | was some dummy didn’t know that trick,” Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\n“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.\n“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.\nCzigo hesitated.\n“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked."], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_c3aa31ef6cf153e761b207dd23cdec4ccd90fe148e87a510eb1495136998f080_v2"}
