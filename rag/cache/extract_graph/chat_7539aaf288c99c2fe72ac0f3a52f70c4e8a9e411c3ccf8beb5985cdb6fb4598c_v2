It reminded her of her own quarters—that same mixture of orderliness and casual disarray. Reading spools lay ina clutter on a small table beside an old-fashioned chair upholstered in soft gray. The spool reader had been swung aside as though its user had just stepped out for a moment, intending to return soon. A Bashar’s black uniform jacket lay across a nearby hard chair with sewing material in a small open box atop it. The jacket’s cuff showed a carefully patched hole.\nSo he does his own mending.\nThis was an aspect of the famous Miles Teg she had not expected. If she had thought about it, she would have said Patrin would absorb such chores.\n“Schwangyu let the attackers in, didn’t she?” Duncan asked.\n“Her people did.” Lucilla did not hide her anger. “She has gone too far. A pact with the Tleilaxu!”\n“Will Patrin kill her?”\n“I don’t know nor do | care!”\nOutside the door, Schwangyu spoke with anger, her voice loud and quite clear: “Are we just going to wait here,\nBashar?”\n“You can leave anytime you wish.” That was Teg.\n“But | can’t enter the south tunnel!”\nSchwangyu sounded petulant. Lucilla knew it for something the old woman did deliberately. What was she planning? Teg must be very cautious now. He had been clever out there, revealing for Lucilla the gaps in Schwangyu’s control, but they had not plumbed Schwangyu’s resources. Lucilla wondered if she should leave Duncan here and return to Teg’s side.\nTeg said: “You can go now but I advise you not to return to your quarters.”\n“And why not?” Schwangyu sounded surprised, really surprised and not covering it well.\n“One moment,” Teg said.\nLucilla became aware of shouting at a distance. A heavy thumping explosion sounded from nearby and then another one more distant. Dust sifted from the cornice above the door to Teg’s sitting room.\n“What was that?” Schwangyu again, her voice overly loud.\nLucilla moved to place herself between Duncan and the wall to the hallway.\nDuncan stared at the door, his body poised for defense.\n“That first blast was what | expected them to do.” Teg again. “The second, | fear, was what they did not expect.”\nA whistle piped nearby loud enough to cover something Schwangyu said.\n“That’s it, Bashar!” Patrin.\n“What is happening?” Schwangyu demanded.\n“The first explosion, dear Reverend Mother, was your quarters being destroyed by our attackers. The second explosion was us destroying the attackers.”\n“I just got the signal, Bashar!” Patrin again. “We got them all. They came down by floater from the no-ship just as you expected.”\n“The ship?” Teg’s voice was full of angry demand.\n“Destroyed the instant it came through the space fold. No Survivors.”\n“You fools!” Schwangyu screamed. “Do you know what you've done?”\n“I carried out my orders to protect that boy from any attack,” Teg said. “By the way, weren’t you supposed to be in your quarters at this hour?”\n“What?”\n“They were after you when they blasted your quarters. The Tleilaxu are very dangerous, Reverend Mother.”\n“| don’t believe you!”\n“I suggest you go look. Patrin, let her pass.”\nAs she listened, Lucilla heard the unspoken argument. The Mentat Bashar had been trusted here more than a Reverend Mother and Schwangyu knew it. She would be desperate. That was clever, suggesting her quarters had been destroyed. She might not believe it, though. Foremost in Schwangyu’s mind now would be the realization that both Teg and Lucilla recognized her complicity in the attack. There was no telling how many others were aware of this. Patrin knew, of course.\nDuncan stared at the closed door, his head tipped slightly to the right. There was a curious expression on his face, as though he saw through the door and actually watched the people out there.\nSchwangyu spoke, the most careful control in her voice. “l don’t believe my quarters were destroyed.” She knew Lucilla was listening.\n“There is only one way to make sure,” Teg said.\nClever! Lucilla thought. Schwangyu could not make a decision until she was certain whether the Tleilaxu had acted treacherously.\n“You will wait here for me, then! That’s an order!” Lucilla heard the swish of Schwangyu’s robes as the Reverend Mother departed.\nVery bad emotional control, Lucilla thought. What this revealed about Teg, though, was equally disturbing. He did it to her! Teg had kept a Reverend Mother off balance.\nThe door in front of Duncan swung open. Teg stood there, one hand on the latch. “Quick!” Teg said. “We must be out of the Keep before she returns.”\n“Out of the Keep?” Lucilla did not hide her shock.\n“Quick, | say! Patrin has prepared a way for us.”\n“But | must—”\n“You must nothing! Come as you are. Follow me or we will be forced to take you.”\n“Do you really think you could take a...” Lucilla broke off. This was a new Teg in front of her and she knew he would not have made such a threat unless he was prepared to carry it out.\n“Very well,” she said. She took Duncan’s hand and followed Teg out of his quarters.\nPatrin stood in the hallway looking to his right. “She’s gone,” the old man said. He looked at Teg. “You know what to do, Bashar?”\n“Pat!”\nLucilla had never before heard Teg use the batman’s diminutive name.\nPatrin grinned, a gleaming full-toothed smile. “Sorry, Bashar. The excitement, you know. l'Il leave you to it, then. | have my part to play.”\nTeg waved Lucilla and Duncan down the hallway to the right. She obeyed and heard Teg close on her heels. Duncan’s hand was sweaty in her hand. He pulled free and strode beside her without looking back.\nThe suspensor-drop at the end of the hallway was guarded by two of Teg’s own people. He nodded to them. “Nobody follows.”\nThey spoke in unison: “Right, Bashar.”\nLucilla realized as she entered the drop with Duncan and Teg that she had chosen sides in a dispute whose workings\nshe did not fully understand. She could feel the movements of the Sisterhood’s politics like a swift current of water pouring all around her. Usually, the movement remained mostly a gentle wave washing the strand, but now she sensed a great destructive surge preparing to thunder its surf upon her.\nDuncan spoke as they emerged into the sorting chamber for the south pillbox.\n“We should all be armed,” he said.\n“We will be very soon,” Teg said. “And | hope you’re prepared to kill anyone who tries to stop us.”\nThe significant fact is this: No Bene Tleilax female has ever been seen away from the protection of their core planets. (Face Dancer mules who simulate females do not count in this analysis. They cannot be breeders.) The Tleilaxu sequester their females to keep them from our hands. This is our primary deduction. It must also be in the eggs that the Tleilaxu Masters conceal their most essential secrets.\n—BENE GESSERIT ANALYSIS, ARCHIVES #XOXTM99 ..... 041\ndd S o we meet at last,” Taraza said.\nShe stared across the two meters of open space between their chairs at Tylwyth Waff. Her analysts assured her that this man was Tleilaxu Master of Masters. What an elfin little figure he was to hold so much power. The prejudices of appearance must be discarded here, she warned herself.\n“Some would not believe this possible,” Waff said.\nHe had a piping little voice, Taraza noted; something else to be measured by different standards.\nThey sat in the neutrality of a Guild no-ship with Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu monitors clinging to the Guildship’s hull like predatory birds on a carcass. (The Guild had been cravenly anxious to placate the Bene Gesserit. “You will pay.” The Guild knew. Payment had been exacted from them before.) The small oval room in which they met was conventionally copper-walled and “spy-proof.” Taraza did not believe this for an instant. She presumed also that the bonds between Guild and Tleilaxu, forged of melange, still existed in full force.\nWaff did not try to delude himself about Taraza. This woman was far more dangerous than any Honored Matre. If he killed Taraza, she would be replaced immediately by\nsomeone just as dangerous, someone with every essential piece of information possessed by the present Mother Superior.\n“We find your new Face Dancers very interesting,” Taraza said.\nWaff grimaced involuntarily. Yes, far more dangerous than the Honored Matres, who were not yet even blaming the Tleilaxu for the loss of an entire no-ship.\nTaraza glanced at the small double-faced digital clock on the low side table at her right, a position where the clock could be read easily by either of them. The Waff-side face had been matched to his internal clock. She noted that the two internal-time readings stood within ten seconds of synchronization at an arbitrary midafternoon. It was one of the niceties of this confrontation where even the positioning and spacing between their chairs had been specified in the arrangements.\nThe two of them were alone in the room. The oval space around them was about six meters in its long dimension, half that in width. They occupied identical sling chairs of peg-fastened wood, which supported orange fabric; not a bit of metal or other foreign material in either of them. The only other furnishing of the room was the side table with its clock. The table was a thin black surface of plaz on three spindly wooden legs. Each of the principals in this meeting had been snooped with care. Each had three personal guards outside the room’s one hatch. Taraza did not think the Tleilaxu would try a Face Dancer exchange, not under the present circumstances!\n“You will pay.”\nThe Tleilaxu, too, were extremely aware of their vulnerability, especially now that they knew a Reverend Mother could expose the new Face Dancers.\nWaff cleared his throat. “I do not expect us to reach an agreement,” he said.\n“Then why did you come?”\n“I seek an explanation of this odd message we have received from your Keep on Rakis. For what are we Supposed to pay?”\n“| beg of you, Ser Waff, drop these foolish pretenses in this room. There are facts known to both of us that cannot be avoided.”\n“Such as?”\n“No female of the Bene Tleilax has ever been provided to us for breeding.” And she thought: Let him sweat that one! It was damnably frustrating not to have a line of Tleilaxu Other Memories for Bene Gesserit investigation and Waff would know it.\nWaff scowled. “Surely you don’t think | would bargain with the life of—” He broke off and shook his head. “I cannot believe this is the payment you would ask.”\nWhen Taraza did not respond, Waff said: “The stupid attack on the Rakian temple was undertaken independently by people on the scene. They have been punished.”\nExpected gambit number three, Taraza thought.\nShe had participated in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7539aaf288c99c2fe72ac0f3a52f70c4e8a9e411c3ccf8beb5985cdb6fb4598c_v2"}
