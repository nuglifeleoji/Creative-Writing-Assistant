The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though. That is the Story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.”\n“As the Emperor wishes it,” Rabban said.\n“As the Emperor wishes it.”\n“What about the smugglers?”\n“No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At any rate, you'll be Spreading some bribes in that quarter...and taking other measures which I’m sure you can think of.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are—slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest vestige of pity or mercy must you show them.”\n“Can one exterminate an entire planet?” Rabban asked.\n“Exterminate?” Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron’s head. “Who said anything about exterminating?”\n“Well, | presumed you were going to bring in new stock and—”\n“| said squeeze, Nephew, not exterminate. Don’t waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy.” He smiled, a baby’s expression in the dimple-fat face. “A Carnivore never stops. Show no mercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry and thirsty.” The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. “Like me.”\n“I see, m’Lord.”\nRabban swung his gaze left and right.\n“It’s all clear then, Nephew?”\n“Except for one thing, Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes.”\n“Ah, yes, Kynes.”\n“He’s the Emperor’s man, m’Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he’s very close to the Fremen...married one.”\n“Kynes will be dead by tomorrow's nightfall.”\n“That’s dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant.”\n“How do you think I’ve come this far this quickly?” the Baron demanded. His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. “Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You’re forgetting that he’s addicted to the spice.”\n“Of course!”\n“Those who know will do nothing to endanger their Supply,” the Baron said. “Kynes certainly must know.”\n“I forgot,” Rabban said.\nThey stared at each other in silence.\nPresently, the Baron said: “Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of your first concerns. I’ve quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Duke’s men got most of what we’d stored for sale.”\nRabban nodded. “Yes, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron brightened. “Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains of organization here and you'll say to them: ‘Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.’”\n“I understand, m’Lord.”\n“This time, I’m sure you do. We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow. Now, leave me to finish my Sleep.”\nThe Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight.\nA tank-brain, the Baron thought. Muscle-minded tank-brain. They will be bloody pulp here when he’s through with them. Then, when | send in Feyd-Rautha to take the load off them, they'll cheer their rescuer. Beloved Feyd-Rautha, Benign Feyd-Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from a beast. Feyd-Rautha, a man to follow and die for. The boy will know by that time how to oppress with impunity. I’m sure he’s the one we need. He'll learn. And such a lovely body. Really a lovely boy.\nAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.\n—FROM “A CHILD'S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: Paul fought the ’thopter’s controls, he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional vortex.\nThe cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his inner sense began to see through the curtain.\nI must find the right vortex, he thought.\nFor a long time now he had sensed the storm’s power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.\nThe vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the ‘thopter left.\nJessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.\n“Paul!” she screamed.\nThe vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the ‘thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out—a winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.\nPaul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert— moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.\n“We're out of it,” Jessica whispered.\nPaul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.\n“We've given them the slip,” he said.\nJessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.\nIt was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It’s gone, but we remain.\n“I don’t like the sound of our wing motion,” Paul said. “We suffered some damage in there.”\nHe felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation.\nHe shivered.\nThe sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was the Sspice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the words had a power of their own.\n“| shall not fear...”\nCause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self- awareness that could not have been without the litany’s magic.\nWords from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: “What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?”\n“There’s rock all around,” Jessica said.\nPaul focused on the ‘thopter’s launching, shook his head to clear it. He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm’s doing.\n“Better set us down on sand,” Jessica said. “The wings might not take full brake.”\nHe nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes. “I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your Safety harness.”\nShe obeyed, thinking: We’ve water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we can do.\n“Run for those rocks the instant we’re stopped,” Paul said. “lIl take the pack.”\n“Run for....” She fell silent, nodded. “Worms.”\n“Our friends, the worms,” he corrected her. “They'll get this ’thopter. There'll be no evidence of where we landed.”\nHow direct his thinking, she thought.\nThey glided lower...lower...\nThere came a rushing sense of motion to their passage—blurred shadows of dunes, rocks lifting like islands. The ‘thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.\nHe’s killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence.\n“Brace yourself!” Paul warned.\nHe pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder. He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings’ leaves.\nAbruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the ‘thopter. The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.\nPaul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and out onto the ‘thopter’s metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its straps.\n“Run!” he ordered.\nHe pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.\nJessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune. She heard Paul’s panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.\n“Follow the ridge,” Paul ordered. “It’ll be faster.”\nThey slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.\nA new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering.\n“Worm,” Paul said.\nIt grew louder.\n“Faster!” Paul gasped.\nThe first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.\nPaul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother’s arm with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\n“I can’t run any farther,” Jessica panted.\nPaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in- motion ran parallel to their rock island—moonlit ripples, Sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul’s eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once—a short\nloop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.\nWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\nThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.\n“It’s bigger than a Guild spaceship,” Paul whispered. “I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but |\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SARDAUKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are the Emperor's elite troops, known for their brutality and loyalty to the Emperor.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE<|>PERSON<|>The Duke is a nobleman who died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept exile.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBAN<|>PERSON<|>Rabban is the Baron's nephew, tasked with ruling Arrakis with a merciless fist.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>The Baron is a powerful and ruthless leader who orchestrates the control of Arrakis.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYNES<|>PERSON<|>Kynes is the Emperor's planetologist on Arrakis, married to a Fremen and close to the Fremen people.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are the native people of Arrakis, known for their resilience and deep knowledge of the desert.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The Emperor is the supreme ruler of the known universe, who manipulates events to maintain his power.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEYD-RAUTHA<|>PERSON<|>Feyd-Rautha is the Baron's nephew, a young and charismatic figure intended to replace Rabban.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet, the only source of the spice melange, and the center of political intrigue.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Tiruzia is the capital of Firuzabad, where the Aurelians were held hostage.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a facility in Tiruzia where hostages were held.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE<|>EVENT<|>The spice melange is a highly valuable substance found only on Arrakis, central to the story's conflict.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABBAN<|>BARON<|>Rabban is the nephew of the Baron and follows his orders to rule Arrakis.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>EMPEROR<|>The Baron serves the Emperor and carries out his will on Arrakis.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>FREMEN<|>Kynes is married to a Fremen and is closely allied with the Fremen people.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>EMPEROR<|>Kynes is the Emperor's planetologist but has his own agenda.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>FEYD-RAUTHA<|>The Baron plans to replace Rabban with Feyd-Rautha to maintain control over Arrakis.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>SARDAUKAR<|>The Duke was killed in an accident, but the Sardaukar were involved in the conflict leading to his death.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABBAN<|>ARRAKIS<|>Rabban is tasked with ruling Arrakis with an iron fist.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Baron seeks to control Arrakis for its spice production.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>ARRAKIS<|>Kynes is the planetologist of Arrakis and deeply connected to its environment.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Fremen are the native inhabitants of Arrakis and have adapted to its harsh conditions.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
