These waves are emitted by cosmic events and have unique atmospheric effects, making them crucial for understanding the universe's dynamics. The degree of their influence is underscored by their relationships with other cosmic entities, such as supernovae and black holes, which are compared to the effects of gravitational waves. This interconnectedness suggests that gravitational waves play a pivotal role in the cosmic ecosystem, influencing both celestial mechanics and atmospheric phenomena.
