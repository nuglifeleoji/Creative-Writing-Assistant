He is primarily recognized as a general sent by 孟获 to guard the 沙口 against the advancing forces of 蜀. This role highlights his strategic importance in the defense against the enemy, showcasing his leadership capabilities in a critical military context.\n\nIn addition to his defensive responsibilities, 阿会喃 is also implicated in the broader military strategies against the renowned strategist 孔明. His involvement in plans against 孔明 indicates that he plays a significant role in the opposition's efforts to counteract the tactics employed by the蜀 forces. This positions him as a key figure in the ongoing power struggles of the time.\n\nHowever, 阿会喃's leadership is not without its challenges. He is described as a leader of the enemy forces who fled during a confrontation with the formidable warriors 赵云 and 魏延. This retreat suggests that despite his strategic roles, he faced significant difficulties in the battlefield, which may have impacted his reputation and effectiveness as a military leader.\n\nInterestingly, there is also an expectation that 阿会喃 may assist 孔明's forces in their military strategy.
