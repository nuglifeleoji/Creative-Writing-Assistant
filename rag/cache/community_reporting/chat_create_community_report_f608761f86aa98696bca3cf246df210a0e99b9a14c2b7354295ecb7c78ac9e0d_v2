Primarily known for its monopoly over the spice melange from Arrakis, CHOAM wields immense influence, with its directorships determining wealth and power among noble Houses. The company operates as a commercial empire under the oversight of the Emperor, though its control was later stripped by Paul Atreides as part of a political maneuver.  \n\nCHOAM’s economic dominance extends beyond spice trade, encompassing broader commerce in the Known Universe. Its banners and flags serve as political symbols, even used by the Emperor to signal authority. The company’s presence is marked by its proximity to powerful factions, such as the Harkonnens, with the Baron himself holding a directorship, underscoring its role in inter-House politics.  \n\nAs the primary entity regulating trade and resources, CHOAM is integral to the Imperium’s stability, making it a focal point of power struggles. Its control over the spice melange—a substance critical for space travel, longevity, and prescience—cements its unrivaled economic and strategic importance. In summary, CHOAM Company is a linchpin of commerce, politics, and power in the Dune universe, with its influence permeating every level of the Imperium.\",9\n71,SALUSA SECUNDUS,\"**Salusa Secundus** is a historically significant and harsh planet, serving as the ancestral homeworld of **House Corrino** and the original training ground for the elite **Sardaukar** troops. Known for its brutal conditions, it has been compared to **Arrakis** in severity and was historically used as an **Imperial prison planet**, where political exiles, including **Shaddam IV** and **Count Fenring**, were sent. The planet’s unforgiving environment made it an ideal location for military conditioning, and it is suspected to have been a secret training site for the Sardaukar, who were renowned for their ferocity.  \n\nUnder **Farad’n Corrino**, Salusa Secundus became the **restored seat of House Corrino**, where he ruled and rebuilt the Sardaukar. The planet features **enclosed gardens** and a **golden sun**, contrasting with its otherwise barren landscape. It was here that **Jessica Atreides** reportedly taught Farad’n, though conflicting accounts suggest she may have been a prisoner at some point, as indicated by **Namri**.  \n\nSalusa Secundus also holds cultural and religious significance, as it is one of the few places where the **Tawrah** and **Talmudic Zabur** texts survived. Additionally, it was a site of political intrigue, with **Princess Wensicia** and **Tyekanik** plotting there, and where **The Preacher** was active. The planet was occasionally referenced in military contexts, such as when **Irulan’s father** conducted landing maneuvers with his legions, raising concerns about potential threats.  \n\nOnce a **prison world** for the Imperium, Salusa Secundus later transitioned into a **political stronghold** for House Corrino, though its legacy as a place of exile and punishment persisted.
