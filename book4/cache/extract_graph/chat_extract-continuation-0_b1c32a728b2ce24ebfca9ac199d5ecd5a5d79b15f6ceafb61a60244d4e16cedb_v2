\n　　治功和高虎领着民兵冲进了田福堂的院子，立刻把斗阵双方手中的器械都缴了。徐治功同时命令，把金家湾那面参与过斗殴的金姓村民都带到田福堂的院子来。 \n　　处理这种事，治功还是有魄力的。他命令民兵把外村的王家和双水村田家、金家三姓所有参与打架的人都捆起来。由于人太多，急忙找不下这么多的绳子，高虎立即派人四处去寻；甚至把牛缰绳都用上了。一霎时，田福堂的院子里横七竖八捆倒了一大片人；连憨牛也被捆在了磨盘上。全双水村的男女老少都赶到了这里，观看了这幕悲剧或者是闹剧的最后一个场面…… \n　　午饭前，王家庄大队的领导也被徐治功派人叫来了。 \n　　在田福堂的中窑里，徐治功主持召开了两个大队领导人的紧急联席会议。会议决定：一、谁砸烂的东西，由砸东西者原价赔给物主。二、谁被打伤，由打人者负责医药费；并负责赔偿伤者养伤期间的工分（也可按两队平均工分值折成人民币）。三、孙玉亭和王彩娥的男女关系问题，因两个人都不承认，不予追究……在开会之前，惊魂未定的田福堂还没忘了安排让人杀了队里的两只羊，又搞了十几斤白面，给公社来的同志们准备了午饭。 \n　　下午，徐治功、杨高虎和十几个公社各单位抽来的民兵，在双水村吃完羊肉烩白面片，喝了茶水，田海民又用拖拉机把这些人送回了石圪节。在此之前，王家庄打架的人也被他们村的领导人带上走了。 \n　　于是，双水村才结束了一天的大动乱，把许多有趣的话题留给村民们以后慢慢去说…… \n                  第51章\n　　秋风以后，再经过寒露、霜降、立冬几个节令，黄土高原就渐渐变成了另一个世界。 \n　　庄稼早已经收割完毕。茫茫旷野，草木凋零，山寒水瘦；那丰茂碧绿的夏天和五彩斑斓的秋天似乎成了遥远的过去。荒寞的大地将要躺在雪白的大氅下，闭住眼回忆自己流逝的日月。 \n　　大地是不会衰老的，冬天只是它的一个宁静的梦；它将会在温暖的春风中也醒过去，使自己再一次年轻！睡吧，亲爱的大地，我们疲劳过渡的父亲……但是，双水村的这块土地，任何时候都不会安宁下来。一进入冬季，这里反而更加充满了激荡的气氛。 \n　　现在，田福堂从夏末开始筹划的拦截哭咽河的宏大工程，已经紧张地进入了实施阶段。
