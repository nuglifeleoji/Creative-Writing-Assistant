省里的各种渠道马上传回来了各种小道消息。从这些消息看来，地区除苗凯以外几乎所有的副职，都有担任专员的可能性。也有几个地区部门的领导人和一两位名声突出的县委书记，列入了这个专员继任者的队伍。另外还有一种说法，省委可能要派省上某个部门的负责人来担当这一职务。但又据本地的一些政治观察家分析，最有可能的还是在现任地区副职中挑选出一个人来任专员。半个月来，某些处于微妙地位的人，心里一直毛毛乱乱；他们的神经处于雷达般的敏感状态中。 \n　　没有人想到黄原地区的新专员是田福军。 \n　　可是现在，竟然是这个人来上任了。 \n　　正因为太出人意料，当这件事成为事实后，公众中引起的强烈反响就不足为奇了。几天之内，田福军一下子成了黄原地区议论的话题。他个人的详细经历，他的家庭、老婆、女儿，他的工作、生活、性格、爱好、走路、说话、声音、相貌……都成了人们口头传播的“信息”。有好几个地区已经出现了声称是田福军亲戚的人。还有人神秘地散布说，解放战争时，田福军和国民党军队浴血奋战，曾身负重伤，当年就在他们家息养了几个月…… \n　　田福军上任之前，省委的任命公文就先一步到了地区。因此他一回来，首先就遇到了这个议论他的风潮。 \n　　行署办公室刚把他安顿在宿舍里，以地区文化局副局长杜正贤为“领队”的原西籍干部，就闻风看望他来了。满屋子的原西土话听起来是亲切的，但场面未免有点庸俗。在有些原西籍干部看来，也许他们荣升的机会来临了。 \n　　田福军压抑着内心的不快，尽量堆着笑容应付走了这群“贺喜”的老乡。他想先尽快和地委书记苗凯同志见见面，听说老苗几天前病了，现住在地区医院里，他就很快起身去地区医院看望他。 \n　　地区医院的“高干”病房里，老苗和他热情握手，欢迎他回来担任专员职务。 \n　　田福军诚恳地说：“苗书记，我没有担负过这么重大的责任，也没这种工作经验，你是一把手，又是我的老领导，今后希望你能经常指导我。” \n　　苗书记把两片药送进嘴里，喝了几口白开水，说：“我已经不行了。脑筋僵化，很难适应目前的领导工作。新时期正需要象你这样思想解放，能开创新局面的领导干部！另外，我最近身体很不好，血压又上去了，从早到晚头昏沉沉的，连当天的文件都看不完。我已经给省委写了信，想请一段假，到省医院去看看病。现在既然你已经到职了，并且又是地委排在第一位的副书记，那么地区的工作你就先全面管上吧……以前我对你的工作安排有些不恰当，�\n######################\nOutput:",
