\n　　田福堂想了后果，又想眼前的现实；想来想去，他也没什么好办法。他难过地看见，儿子现在一天也没多少话，在家中走里走出，只是个抽纸烟。本来他很反感儿子抽烟——年轻轻的，就抽成了一副老烟瘾，这还了得！弄不好将来和他一样，成了气管炎。但他又想到娃娃苦闷，只好睁一只眼闭一只眼。抽就抽去吧！他发现，他搁在家里的纸烟，都让这小子抽完了，可他仍然烟不离嘴。奇怪！他买纸烟的钱是哪里来的？慢慢一想，他才估计到是他妈偷偷给他塞钱哩！唉，也难怪，他老两口就这么个宝贝儿子，从小娇惯了这么大。就是儿子开口问他要钱买烟，他也得给！ \n　　在田福堂为儿子的事万般焦虑的时候，有一天，他的主要助手孙玉亭来他家串门。 \n　　在拉谈了一会村里的工作以后，玉亭对他提起了润生的事，说：“福堂哥，你最近大概为润生的事犯愁着哩？” \n　　田福堂心里想：这玉亭！真是把他的心思摸透了。他的一切喜怒哀乐，玉亭马上就能入微地体察到。难怪金俊武敲怪话说，他打个喷嚏，玉亭就感冒了。 \n　　玉亭既然提起了这事，他就只好说：“唉，就是的……这娃娃身体不好，从小也没受过苦，现在回来要参加劳动，怕吃消不了。我想来想去，也没个好办法……” \n　　“怎没办法？”玉亭盯着愁眉苦脸的书记，“我也一直替你想这事呢，最近倒想出了一个好办法！” \n　　“什么办法？”田福堂很感兴趣地问。 \n　　“让润生教书去！” \n　　“教书？到哪里去教呢？”田福堂立刻感到玉亭有点不着边际了。 \n　　“就在咱本村教！” \n　　“本村？本村两个教师，位置满满的，能增加进去人吗？”“咱办初中！”玉亭兴奋地说，“只要办起了初中，不就得增加教师吗？现在党号召发展教育事业，提倡社队办初中。咱们村完全有条件搞这事！实际上，这也不难，只要增加一个初中班就行了，村里小学一年又毕业不了几个娃娃！再说，公社教育专干前几年也给我提念让咱们村办初中班呢……” \n　　田福堂听玉亭这么一说，倒开始认真思考这个大胆的设想，觉得这里面还真有些门道哩！他就说：“咦？你这主意倒还新鲜！玉亭，你再往下说！” \n　　“另外，从政治路线方面说，咱们贫下中农应该占领教育阵地。可咱们村两个教师，一个是地主家的儿媳\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
