Once part of a planet-wide desert known as the *bahr bela ma* (\"\"ocean without water\"\"), the Sareer is now a remnant of Arrakis's former desert glory, enclosed by the imposing **barrier Wall**. This high-walled domain served as the Tyrant's stronghold, centered around the **Citadel** and the **Little Citadel**, from which Leto II observed the arid landscape.  \n\nGeographically, the Sareer is located far to the south, bordered by the **Forbidden Forest** and near **Tuono** and **Tabur Village**. Its harsh, desolate environment is visible from key locations such as the Citadel's south tower and Moneo's workroom. The region is frequently mentioned in narratives involving movement and climbing, underscoring its role as a pivotal setting.  \n\nOnce the great walled desert of Leto II's reign, the Sareer has since eroded, yet it remains a symbol of the planet's transformation and the Tyrant's legacy. The river that once flowed through it has vanished, marking the end of an era. Despite its decline, the Sareer endures as a testament to Arrakis's past, embodying both its ecological and political history.\",8\n786,TUONO,,7\n1489,WALL,\"The **WALL** is a significant geographical and structural feature with dual characteristics. Near **Tuono village**, it appears as a natural geographical formation, with a river located beyond it. However, it is also described as the **barrier Wall**, a massive artificial structure enclosing the **Sareer**. This imposing wall has a sheer face, which is currently being scaled by a climber named **Idaho**.  \n\nThe two descriptions suggest that the WALL may serve both as a natural boundary and a constructed barrier, possibly blending into the landscape or serving different purposes depending on its location. The presence of a river beyond its natural segment implies a division between territories, while its role as an enclosure for the Sareer indicates a defensive or restrictive function. The fact that Idaho is climbing its sheer face further emphasizes its formidable and challenging nature.  \n\nTo reconcile the descriptions, the WALL likely exists as a hybrid structure—part natural, part man-made—with varying features along its expanse. Its proximity to Tuono village and the Sareer suggests it plays a key role in the region's geography and possibly its societal or political dynamics. The combined details paint a picture of a monumental and multifaceted barrier, serving both as a physical landmark and a significant obstacle.  \n\n(Word count: 186)\",4\n1473,IXIAN INSTRUMENTS,\"Technological devices created by Ixians to monitor and control the Sareer's climate\"\"\",1\n1497,RINGWALL WEST,\"Ringwall West is a location where the procession climbs, marking a significant point in the narrative.\"\"\",1\n1695,GOD’S WAY,\"A wide avenue in the city, historically the Tyrant's route into the city from the Sareer.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3392,SAREE,LETO,Leto has a deep infatuation with the Sareer desert and its history,219\n3457,TUONO,SAREE,\"Tuono is located at the edge of the Sareer, a desert region on Arrakis.\",15\n3511,WALL,ROYAL ROAD,The Royal Road is located atop the Wall,10\n3394,SAREE,IXIAN INSTRUMENTS,The instruments maintain the Sareer's artificial desert environment,9\n3504,SAREE,RINGWALL WEST,\"The Sareer and Ringwall West are connected geographically in Leto's empire.\nThe Sareer and Ringwall West are geographical locations mentioned in the narrative, with the procession moving between them.\",9\n4020,GOD’S WAY,SAREE,God’s Way was the Tyrant's route from the Sareer into the city.,9\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
