These events have left a lasting mark on him, fueling his animosity toward the Harkonnens. The betrayal on Giedi Prime, in particular, stands out as a defining moment in his relationship with them, reinforcing his distrust and resentment.  \n\nWhile the descriptions do not provide explicit details about the nature of the atrocities or the specifics of the betrayal, they collectively emphasize Duncan Idaho’s deep-seated enmity toward the Harkonnens. His hostility is rooted in both personal suffering and the broader injustices committed by the Harkonnens, painting them as ruthless adversaries in his life. The two descriptions align in portraying the Harkonnens as cruel and treacherous, with Duncan Idaho’s hatred serving as a consistent and justified response to their actions.  \n\nIn summary, Duncan Idaho’s intense disdain for the Harkonnens is driven by their violent acts against his family and their deceitful actions on Giedi Prime, solidifying his view of them as irredeemable enemies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751252066, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 59}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
