如此，这种作用也是十分有限的，因为低维展开至宏观足度的智子本身是十分脆弱的。在人类已经建立防御系统的夸天，它不可能有这种行为，否则只是提供了人类消灭它的极好机会。我认为，主流媒体应该向公众加强这方面的科普宣传，以消除这种没有科学根据的恐慌。\n　　张援朝听到客厅有人不敲门就闯了进来，“老张”、“张师傅”地喊着。其实刚才老张昕到楼梯上那重锤般的脚步声就知道是谁来了。进来的是苗福全，是住在这一层的另一个邻居。这人是山两的煤老板，在那边开着好几个矿。苗福全比张援朝小几岁，他在北京别处还有更大的房子，在这里只是安置着一个被他包养的年龄和他女儿差不多的四川女子。刚住进来时，张扬两家都不太搭理苗福全，而且还因为他在楼道里乱放东珂吵过一次架，但后来发现老苗人虽粗些，还算个不错的人，待人很热情，还通过与物业公司交涉为他们两家摆平了两件麻烦事，三家的关系就渐渐融洽起来。苗福全虽说把生意上的事都交给了儿子，可仍是个大忙人，在这个“家”待的时间不多，平时那套三居室里也只有那个川妹子。\n　　“老苗啊，有个把月不见了，最近哪儿发财啊？”杨晋文问。\n　　苗福全随便拿起个杯子，从饮水机中接了半杯水咕咚咕咚灌下去，抹抹嘴说：“矿上出了麻烦事，回去打理打理。还发个狗屁的财啊。现在算是战争时期了，政府可是什么都动真格儿的，我以前的那些法儿都不好使了，这矿是开不了多长时间了。”\n　　“苦日子就要来了。”老杨说，眼睛没有离开电视上的球赛。\n　　这个男人一动不动地躺在床上已经几个小时了，透过地下室的小窗射入的一缕阳光现在已变成了月光，这束阴冷的光线在地上投出的亮斑是这里唯一的光源，房间里的一切在阴暗中都像是用湿冷的灰色石头雕成的。整个房间像个墓穴。\n　　这个人的真名一直不为人知，后来他被称为破壁人二号。\n　　在这段时间里，破壁人二号回顾了自己的一生，确定没有什么遗漏之后，翻动已经躺得麻木的身体，伸手从枕头下抽出手枪，缓缓把枪口凑到自己的太阳穴上。这时，他眼睛中出现了智子的字幕。\n　　字幕：不要这样做，我们需要你。\n　　破壁人二号：“是主吗？这一年来我每天晚上都梦到你的召唤，不过最近没有了，我本来以为自己已经是一个无梦之人了，看来不是的。”\n　　字幕：这不是梦，我在和你实时交谈。\n　　破壁人二号（凄凉地笑笑）：“好了，都结束了，那边肯定是无梦\n######################\nOutput:",
