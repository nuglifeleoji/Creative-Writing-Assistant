\n　　正在她惶惶不安的时候，突然收到了润生的一封信。红梅高兴的是，润生在信中除过象往日那样表示对她热烈的爱恋和思念外，并且还告诉她，说他很快就会回到她的身边。他没在信中提及他父母的态度。红梅猜测，老人大概同意了；要不，润生不会说他马上就来……但是，整整一个秋天过去了，田润生还没有来。冬天又过了，仍然不见他的踪影……日月如水地流逝，转眼间就是一年。现在，郝红梅依旧孤单地带着自己的孩子，象土拨鼠一般悄无声息地生活着。她苦心等待的那个人终于失去了音讯……可怜的红梅再一次陷入到绝望之中。心头复燃的火焰重新熄灭，脸颊上泛出的那两片红晕也消失了。生活又回到了往日那一片凄风苦雨之中。 \n　　这就是你的命运，她想。即然你生来就要无尽地受苦受难，你为什么要相信那偶然一瞬间出现在你面前的光辉呢？你呀，永远不要再抱什么幻想！命运决定你就该如此生活……那种由希望所带来的幸福，以及这幸福被粉碎后的痛苦，都很快退潮似地一齐消失了。郝红梅又日复一日开始了她那麻木不仁的生活。她带着自己的孩子，做饭，喂猪，种地。没有笑容，也不哭泣。没有过去，也无未来。天明时，她去干活，天黑时，她就睡觉。所谓明天，也无非是和今天同样的一天…… \n　　她的小亮亮跟着她，就在这寂寞的日子中一天天往大长。他是个好动的孩子，一刻也不停地跑动和玩耍。母子俩相依为命，他从不离开她身边。她在地里劳动的时候，他就在周围玩。他最爱玩的是打窑窑。每天都要在地里造几孔“窑洞”。唉，他父亲就是打土窑才丧命的……不知哪一天，孩子突然问她：“妈妈，人家都是爸爸在地里干活，你为什么不让爸爸干？我的爸爸在哪儿哩？” \n　　孩子的问话象尖刀一般戳在了她的心口。她几乎想放开声哭一鼻子。 \n　　她强忍着泪水对儿子说：“你爸爸……到外面去了……” \n　　“他什么时候回来？我可想他哩！”亮亮追问她。她把儿子紧紧搂在怀里，无声地痛哭起来……在这期间，她父亲从原西的老家来此地看过她两次。老人面对她的悲惨遭遇，也只是流泪和叹息。他一边流泪，一边打劝她歪好再寻个人——出门走可以，招个人上门也可以，总之，她不能一辈子就这样一个人里外操磨。父亲第二次来的时候，说他已经在\n######################\nOutput:",
