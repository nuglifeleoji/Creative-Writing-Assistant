If Miles had really found a hideaway .. . if he were to emerge now, he would need all the help he could get. Once more, she considered whether it was time to play the prescient game. So dangerous! And the Tleilaxu had been alerted that their replacement ghola might be required.\n“Ready him for delivery.”\nHer mind swung to the Rakis problem. That fool Tuek should have been monitored more carefully. How long could a Face Dancer safely impersonate him? There was no faulting Odrade’s on-scene decision, though. She had put the Tleilaxu into an untenable position. The impersonator could be exposed, plunging the Bene Tleilaxu into a sink of hatred.\nThe game within the Bene Gesserit design had become very delicate. For generations now, they had held out to the Rakian priesthood the bait of a Bene Gesserit alliance. But now! The Tleilaxu must consider that they had been chosen instead of the priests. Odrade’s three-cornered alliance, let the priests think every Reverend Mother would take the Oath of Subservience to the Divided God. The Priestly Council would stutter with excitement at the prospect. The Tleilaxu, of course, saw the chance to monopolize melange, controlling at last the one source independent of them.\nA rap at Taraza’s door told her the acolyte had arrived with tea. It was a standing order when the Mother Superior worked late. Taraza glanced at the table chrono, an Ixian device so accurate it would gain or lose only one second in a century: 1:23:11 a.m.\nShe called to admit the acolyte. The girl, a pale blond with coldly observant eyes, entered and bent to arrange the contents of her tray beside Taraza.\nTaraza ignored the girl and stared at the work remaining on the table. So much to do. Work was more important than sleep. But her head ached and she felt the telltale dazed sensation akin to a stunned brain that told her the tea would provide little relief. She had worked herself into mental starvation and it would have to be put right before she could even stand. Her shoulders and back throbbed.\nThe acolyte started to leave but Taraza motioned for her to wait. “Rub my back please, Sister.”\nThe acolyte’s educated hands slowly worked out the constrictions in Taraza’s back. Good girl. Taraza smiled at this thought. Of course she was good. No lesser creature could be assigned to the Mother Superior.\nWhen the girl had gone, Taraza sat silently in deep thought. So /ittle time. She begrudged every minute of sleep. There was no escaping it, though. Eventually, the body made its unavoidable demands. She had pressed herself beyond easy recuperation for days now. Ignoring the tea laid out beside her, Taraza arose and went down the hall to her tiny sleeping cell. There, she left a call with the Night Guard for 11:00 a.m. and composed herself fully robed on the hard cot.\nQuietly, she regulated her breathing, insulated her senses from distraction and fell into the between-state.\nSleep did not come.\nShe went through her full repertoire and still sleep evaded her.\nTaraza lay there for a long time, recognizing at last the futility of willing herself to sleep with any of the techniques at her disposal. The between-state would have to do its slow mending first. Meanwhile, her mind continued to churn.\nThe Rakian priesthood she had never considered to be a central problem. Already caught up in religion, the priests could be manipulated by religion. They saw the Bene Gesserit chiefly as a power that could enforce their dogma. Let them continue to think this. It was bait that would blind them.\nDamn that Miles Teg! Three months of silence, and no favorable report from Burzmali, either. Charred ground, signs of a no-ship’s lift-off. Where could Teg have gone? The ghola might be dead. Teg had never before done such a thing. Old Reliability. That was why she had chosen him. That and his military skills and his likeness to the old Duke Leto—all of the things they had prepared in him.\nTeg and Lucilla. A perfect team.\nIf not dead, was the ghola beyond their reach? Did the Tleilaxu have him? Attackers from the Scattering? Many things were possible. Old Reliability. Silent. Was his silence a message? If so, what was he trying to say?\nWith both Schwangyu and Patrin dead, there was the smell of conspiracy around the Gammu events. Could Teg be someone planted long ago by the Sisterhood’s enemies? Impossible! His own family was proof against such doubts. Teg’s daughter at the family home was as mystified as anyone.\nThree months now and not a word.\nCaution. She had warned Teg to exercise the utmost caution in protecting the ghola. Teg had seen the great danger on Gammu. Schwangyu’s last reports made that Clear.\nWhere could Teg and Lucilla have taken the ghola?\nWhere had they acquired a no-ship? Conspiracy?\nTaraza’s mind kept circling around her deep suspicions. Was it Odrade’s doing? Then who conspired with Odrade? Lucilla? Odrade and Lucilla had never met before that brief encounter on Gammu. Or had they? Who bent close to Odrade and breathed a mutual air weighted with whispers? Odrade gave no sign, but what proof was that? Lucilla’s loyalty had never been doubted. They both functioned perfectly as assigned. But so would conspirators.\nFacts! Taraza hungered for facts. The bed rustled beneath her and her sense-insulation collapsed, shattered by worries as much as by the sound of her own movements. Resignedly, Taraza once more composed herself for relaxation.\nRelaxation and then sleep.\nShips from the Scattering flitted through Taraza’s fatigue- fogged imagination. Lost Ones returned in their uncounted no-ships. Was that where Teg found a ship? This possibility was being explored as quietly as they could on Gammu and elsewhere. She tried counting imaginary ships but they refused to proceed in the orderly fashion required for sleep induction. Taraza came alert without moving on her cot.\nHer deepest mind was trying to reveal something. Fatigue had blocked that path of communication but now—she sat up fully awake.\nThe Tleilaxu had been dealing with people returned from the Scattering. With these whorish Honored Matres and with returned Bene Tleilax as well. Taraza sensed a single design behind events. The Lost Ones did not return out of simple curiosity about their roots. The gregarious desire to reunite all of humankind was not enough in itself to bring them back. The Honored Matres clearly came with dreams of conquest.\nBut what if the Tleilaxu sent out in the Scattering had not carried with them the secret of the axlotl tanks? What then? Melange. The orange-eyed whores obviously used an inadequate substitute. The people of the Scattering might\nnot have solved the mystery of the Tleilaxu tanks. They would know about axlotl tanks and try to re-create them. But if they failed—melange!\nShe began to explore this projection.\nThe Lost Ones ran out of the true melange their ancestors took into the Scattering. What sources did they have then? The worms of Rakis and the original Bene Tleilax. The whores would not dare reveal their true interest. Their ancestors believed that the worms could not be transplanted. Was it possible the Lost Ones had found a Suitable planet for the worms? Of course it was possible. They might begin bargaining with the Tleilaxu as a diversion. Rakis would be their real target. Or the reverse could be true.\nTransportable wealth.\nShe had seen Teg’s reports on the wealth being accumulated on Gammu. Some among the ones returning had coinages and other negotiable chips. That much was plain from the banking activities.\nWhat greater currency was there, though, than the spice?\nWealth. That was it, of course. And whatever the chips, the bargaining had begun.\nTaraza grew aware of voices outside her door. The acolyte Sleep-Guard was arguing with someone. The voices were low but Taraza heard enough to bring her into full alert.\n“She left a wake-up for late morning,” the Sleep-Guard protested.\nSomeone else whispered: “She said she was to be told the moment | returned.”\n“I tell you she is very tired. She needs—”\n“She needs to be obeyed! Tell her I’m back!”\nTaraza sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the cot. Her feet found the floor. Gods! How her knees ached. It pained her, too, that she could not place the intruding whisper, the person arguing with her guard.\nWhose return did I... Burzmali!\n“I’m awake,” Taraza called.\nHer door opened and the Sleep-Guard leaned in. “Mother Superior, Burzmali has returned from Gammu.”\n“Send him in at once!” Taraza activated a single glowglobe at the head of her cot. Its yellow light washed away the room’s darkness.\nBurzmali entered and closed the door behind him. Without being told, he touched the sound-insulation switch on the door and all outside noises vanished.\nPrivacy? It was bad news then.\nShe looked up at Burzmali. He was a short, slender fellow with a sharply triangular face narrowing to a thin chin. Blond hair swept over a high forehead. His widely spaced green eyes were alert and watchful. He looked far too young for the responsibilities of a Bashar, but then Teg had looked even younger at Arbelough. We are getting old, damn it. She forced herself to relax and place her trust in the fact that Teg had trained this man and expressed full confidence in him.\n“Tell me the bad news,” Taraza said.\nBurzmali cleared his throat. “Still no sign of the Bashar and his party on Gammu, Mother Superior.” He had a heavy, masculine voice.\nAnd that’s not the worst of it, Taraza thought. She saw the clear signs of Burzmali’s nervousness.\n“Let’s have it all,” she ordered. “Obviously, you have completed your examination of the Keep’s ruins.”\n“No survivors,” he said. “The attackers were thorough.”\n“Tleilaxu?”\n“Possible.”\n“You have doubts?”\n“The attackers used that new Ixian explosive, 12-Uri. l... | think it may have been used to mislead us. There were mechanical brain-probe holes in Schwangyu’s skull, too.”\n“What of Patrin?”\n“Exactly as Schwangyu reported. He blew himself up in that decoy ship. They identified him from bits of two fingers and one intact eye. There was nothing left big enough to probe.”\n“But you have doubts! Get to them!”\n“Schwangyu left a message that only we might read.”\n“In the wear marks on furniture?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior, and—”\n“Then she knew she would be attacked and had time to leave a message. | saw your earlier report on the devastation of the attack.”\n“It was quick and totally overpowering. The attackers did not try to take captives.”\n“What did she say?”\n“Whores.”\nTaraza tried to contain her shock, although she had been expecting that word. The effort to remain calm almost drained her energies. This was very bad. Taraza permitted herself a deep sigh. Schwangyu’s opposition\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_53bb32d2d7ca3cb51cd3c302525789a5a8e328f051203b23a85c77861bfee15c_v2"}
