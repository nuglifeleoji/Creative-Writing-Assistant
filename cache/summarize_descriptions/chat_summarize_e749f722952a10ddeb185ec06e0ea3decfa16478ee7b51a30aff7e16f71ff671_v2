The descriptions highlight that fate is not merely a backdrop but a driving force that leads to tragic events in their lives. \n\nIn the context of \"弗兰肯斯坦,\" fate is portrayed as an inescapable influence that dictates the course of the protagonist's life and the lives of those around him. The tragic events that unfold serve as a testament to the power of fate, suggesting that despite their efforts, the characters are unable to escape the predetermined paths laid out for them.
