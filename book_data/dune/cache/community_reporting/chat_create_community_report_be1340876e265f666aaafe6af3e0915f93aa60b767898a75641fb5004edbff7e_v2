This glacier spans approximately three miles in width and is characterized by its undulating ice formations, deep crevasses, and a rugged surface, which together create a harsh and unforgiving landscape. \n\nIn the context of the story, the glacier symbolizes the formidable obstacles that sailors must confront, representing the challenges that can be overcome with determination and resilience. It serves as a stark reminder of the natural world's power and the isolation that comes with navigating such treacherous terrains. The glacier is depicted as a cold and desolate environment, further emphasizing the loneliness experienced by the beings that inhabit or traverse this icy realm.\n\nDespite its harshness, the glacier also provides a sense of security for certain creatures, as it serves as their home and refuge amidst the unforgiving conditions. This duality highlights the glacier's role as both a source of danger and a sanctuary, illustrating the complex relationship between life and the extreme environments in which it exists.\n\nGeographically, the glacier is formed from the accumulation of snow and ice, typically found in high mountain regions, and is noted for its breathtaking visual effects.

This association underscores the glacier's role as a site of both beauty and peril, encapsulating the essence of nature's duality.\n\nIn summary, the glacier, or \"\"冰川,\"\" is a majestic yet intimidating ice formation that embodies the challenges of the natural world, the isolation of its inhabitants, and the complex interplay between danger and safety.
