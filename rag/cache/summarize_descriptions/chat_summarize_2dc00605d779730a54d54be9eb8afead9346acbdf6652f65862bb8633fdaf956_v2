This knowledge serves as a key element of his bargaining power, allowing him to navigate negotiations and alliances with greater leverage. However, despite his familiarity with their methods, Waff remains deeply concerned about the threat they pose. He recognizes the Honored Matres' techniques as highly dangerous and has taken it upon himself to warn others, such as Taraza, about their capabilities. His warnings highlight both the tactical and existential risks the Honored Matres present, underscoring his dual role as both an informed intermediary and a cautious adversary.  \n\nIn summary, Waff’s relationship with the Honored Matres is complex—he leverages their knowledge for strategic advantage while simultaneously working to mitigate the dangers they represent.
