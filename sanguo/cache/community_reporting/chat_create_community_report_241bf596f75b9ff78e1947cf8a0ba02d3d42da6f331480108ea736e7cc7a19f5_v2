This ingenious invention was specifically designed to facilitate the movement of supplies, particularly grain and other essential resources, to support the Shu army during battles.\n\nThe wooden oxen and flowing horses were crafted as wooden carts that could transport supplies across challenging terrains, thereby providing crucial logistical support on the battlefield. Zhuge Liang's design allowed for the efficient transfer of provisions, which was vital for maintaining the morale and fighting capability of the Shu troops. The use of 木牛流马 not only enhanced the army's supply chain but also served as a strategic deception tactic against the enemy, as the movement of these wooden carts could mislead opponents regarding the actual troop movements and supply routes.\n\nIn summary, 木牛流马 represents a significant advancement in military logistics, showcasing Zhuge Liang's ingenuity and strategic foresight. This wooden transportation tool played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Shu army remained well-supplied during critical military campaigns, ultimately contributing to their operational effectiveness in the face of adversity.\",10\r\n2038,祁山大寨,\"祁山大寨 is a significant military camp associated with the Shu forces during the historical period of the Three Kingdoms in China.

This camp was not only a strategic hub for military planning but also a gathering point for Kongming to assemble and lead his troops effectively.\n\nIn addition to its role in military strategy, 祁山大寨 was vital for logistical support. The camp was equipped with the innovative wooden oxen and flowing horses (木牛流马), which were instrumental in transporting supplies and provisions, ensuring that the Shu forces were well-supplied during their campaigns. This logistical capability underscored the importance of 祁山大寨 as a base of operations for the Shu army, facilitating their movements and enhancing their operational effectiveness in the field.\n\nOverall, 祁山大寨 stands out as a key military installation in the history of the Shu Han, reflecting both the strategic acumen of Kongming and the logistical innovations that supported the Shu forces during their military endeavors.\",2\r\n1932,高翔,\"高翔 is a military officer known for his significant role in various military operations during the Three Kingdoms period.

In this capacity, 高翔 was responsible for commanding the innovative wooden oxen and flowing horses (木牛流马) used for transporting supplies, showcasing his logistical capabilities.\n\nThroughout his military career, 高翔 demonstrated strong leadership and strategic acumen. He participated in ambushes against enemy forces, notably assisting in the ambush against Ma Zun's troops. His involvement in these operations highlighted his commitment to the defense of Shu Han and his ability to coordinate effectively with other military leaders, such as Wei Yan. During one of the conflicts, he fought alongside Wei Yan and was also rescued, indicating his active engagement in battle and the camaraderie among the Shu Han forces.\n\nAdditionally, 高翔 was involved in counter-offensive plans against the Wei army, further emphasizing his role in the military strategies of Shu Han. His leadership was instrumental in executing these plans, which aimed to repel Wei forces and protect Shu territories.\n\nHowever, there is a contradiction in the descriptions regarding his allegiance, as one source states that 高翔 is a general of Wei, while the majority of the descriptions affirm his position within Shu Han. To resolve this, it is clear that 高翔 is primarily associated with Shu Han, where he served as a general and played a crucial role in their military efforts against Wei.\n\nIn summary, 高翔 is a prominent military officer of Shu Han, recognized for his leadership in logistics and combat.
