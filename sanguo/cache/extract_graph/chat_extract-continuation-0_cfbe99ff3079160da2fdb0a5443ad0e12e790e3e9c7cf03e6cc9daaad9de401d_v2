封进兵，令二虎相并；刘封或有功，或败绩，必归成都，就而除之，可绝两害。玄德从之，遂遣使到绵竹，传谕刘封。封受命，率兵来擒孟达。却说曹丕正聚文武议事，忽近臣奏曰：“蜀将孟达来降。”丕召入问曰：“汝此来，莫非诈降乎？”达曰：“臣为不救关公之危，汉中王欲杀臣，因此惧罪来降，别无他意。”！曹丕尚未准信，忽报刘封引五万兵来取襄阳，单搦孟达厮杀。丕曰：“汝既是真心，便可去襄阳取刘封首级来，孤方准信。”达曰：“臣以利害说之，不必动兵，令刘封亦来降也。”丕大喜，遂加孟达为散骑常侍、建武将军、平阳亭侯，领新城太守，去守襄阳、樊城。原来夏侯尚、徐晃已先在襄阳，正将收取上庸诸部。孟达到了襄阳，与二将礼毕，探得刘封离城五十里下寨。达即修书一封，使人赍赴蜀寨招降刘封。刘封览书大怒曰：“此贼误吾叔侄之义，又间吾父子之亲，使吾为不忠不孝之人也！”遂扯碎来书，斩其使，次日，引军前来搦战。\n\n    孟达知刘封扯书斩使，勃然大怒，亦领兵出迎。两阵对圆，封立马于门旗下。以刀指骂曰：“背国反贼，安敢乱言！”孟达曰：“汝死已临头上，还自执迷不省！”封大怒，拍马轮刀，直奔孟达。战不三合，达败走，封乘虚追杀二十余里，一声喊起，伏兵尽出，左边夏侯尚杀来，右边徐晃杀来，孟达回身复战。三军夹攻，刘封大败而走，连夜奔回上庸，背后魏兵赶来。刘封到城下叫门，城上乱箭射下。申耽在敌楼上叫曰：“吾已降了魏也！”封大怒，欲要攻城，背后追军将至，封立脚不住，只得望房陵而奔，见城上已尽插魏旗。申仪在敌楼上将旗一飐，城后一彪军出，旗上大书“右将军徐晃”。封抵敌不住，急望西川而走。晃乘势追杀。刘封部下只剩得百余骑。到了成都，入见汉中王，哭拜于地，细奏前事。玄德怒曰：“辱子有何面目复来见吾！”封曰：“叔父之难，非儿不救，因孟达谏阻故耳。”玄德转怒曰：“汝须食人食、穿人衣，非土木偶人！安可听谗贼所阻！”命左右推出斩之。汉中王既斩刘封，后闻孟达招之，毁书斩使之事，心中颇悔；又哀痛关公，以致染病。因此按兵不动。\n\n
