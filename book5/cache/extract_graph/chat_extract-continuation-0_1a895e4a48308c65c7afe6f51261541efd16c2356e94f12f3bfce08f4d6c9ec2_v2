上相机骑着自行车出去了。作为一名摄影爱好者，他最向往的题材是人迹罕至的荒野，但人到中年，已经没有精力进行这种奢侈的享受了，大多数时间只能在城市里拍风景了。他有意无意地选取城市中那些散发着蛮荒气息的角落，如公园中干涸的湖底、建筑工地上翻出的新土、钻出水泥缝隙的野草等。为了消除背景上城市的俗艳色彩，他只使用黑白胶片，没想到竟自成一派，渐渐小有名气，作品入选了两次大影展，还加入了摄影家协会。每次出去拍摄，他就这样骑着自行车在城市里随意乱转，捕捉着灵感和他需要的构图，有时一转就是一整天。\n　　今天，汪淼的感觉有些异样。他的摄影以古典风格的沉稳凝重见长，但今天，他很难再找到创造这种构图所需要的稳定感，在他的感觉中，这座正在晨曦中苏醒的城市似乎建立在流沙上，它的稳定是虚幻的。在刚过去的那一夜，那两颗台球一直占据着他长长的梦境，它在黑色的空间中无规则地乱飞，在黑色的背景一卜．黑球看不见，它只有在偶尔遮挡白球时才显示一下自己的存在。\n　　难道物质的本原真的是无规律吗?难道世界的稳定和秩序，只是宇宙某个角落短暂的动态平衡?只是混乱的湍流中一个短命的旋涡?\n　　不知不觉中，他已骑到了新落成的CCTV大厦脚下。他停下车，坐到路边，仰望这A字形的巍峨建筑，试图找回稳定的感觉，顺着大厦在朝阳中闪烁的尖顶的指向，他向深不见底的蓝色苍穹望去，脑海中突然浮现出两个词：射手、农场主。\n　　在“科学边界”的学者们进行讨论时，常用到一个缩写词：SF，它不是指科幻，而是上面那两个词的缩写。这源自两个假说，都涉及到宇宙规律的本质。\n　　“射手”假说：有一名神枪手，在一个靶子上每隔十厘米打一个洞。设想这个靶子的平面上生活着一种二维智能生物，它们中的科学家在对自己的宇宙进行观察后，发现了一个伟大的定律： “宇宙每隔十厘米，必然会有一个洞。”它们把这个神枪手一时兴起的随意行为，看成了自己宇宙中的铁律。\n　　“农场主假说”则有一层令人不安的恐怖色彩：一个农场里有一一群火鸡，农场主每天中午十一点来给它们喂食。火鸡中的一名科学家观察这个现象，一直观察了近一年都没有例外，于是它也发现了自己宇宙中的伟大定律：“每天上午十一点，就有食物降临。”它在感恩节早晨向火鸡们公布了这个定律，但这天上午十一点食物没有降临，农场主进来把它们都捉去杀了。\n　　汪淼感\n######################\nOutput:",
