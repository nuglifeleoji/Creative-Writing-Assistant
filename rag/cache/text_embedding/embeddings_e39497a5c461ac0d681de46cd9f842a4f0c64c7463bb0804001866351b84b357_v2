Nothing could be gained by flight. Only the priests used ‘thopters. They could go anywhere and see anything.\nTwo richly robed priests, their garments all gold and white with purple trim, emerged and ran toward her across the sand. They knelt in front of Sheeana so close she could smell their perspiration and the musky melange incense which permeated their clothing. They were young but much like all the priests she could remember: soft of features, uncalloused hands, careless of their moisture losses. Neither of them wore a stillsuit under those robes.\nThe one on her left, his eyes on a level with Sheeana’s, spoke.\n“Child of Shai-hulud, we saw your Father bring you from His lands.”\nThe words made no sense to Sheeana. Priests were men to be feared. Her parents and all the adults she had ever known had impressed this upon her by words and actions. Priests possessed ornithopters. Priests fed you to Shaitan for the slightest infraction or for no infraction at all, for only priestly whims. Her people knew many instances.\nSheeana backed away from the kneeling men and cast her glance around. Where could she run?\nThe one who had spoken raised an imploring hand. “Stay with us.”\n“You're bad!” Sheeana’s voice cracked with emotion.\nBoth priests fell prostrate on the sand.\nFar away on the city’s towers, sunlight flashed off lenses. Sheeana saw them. She knew about such flashings. Priests were always watching you in the cities. When you saw the lenses flash that was the signal to be inconspicuous, to “be good.”\nSheeana clasped her hands in front of her to still their trembling. She glanced left and right and then at the prostrate priests. Something was wrong here.\nHeads on the sand, the two priests shuddered with fear and waited. Neither spoke.\nSheeana did not know how to respond. The crush of her immediate experiences could not be absorbed by an eight- year-old mind. She knew that her parents and all of her neighbors had been taken by Shaitan. Her own eyes had witnessed this. And Shaitan had brought her here, refusing to take her into his awful fires. She had been spared.\nThis was a word she understood. Spared. It had been explained to her when she learned the dancing song.\n“Shai-hulud spare us!\n“Take Shaitan away...”\nSlowly, not wanting to arouse the prostrate priests, Sheeana began the shuffling, unrhythmic movements of the dance. As the remembered music grew within her, she unclasped her hands and swung her arms wide. Her feet lifted high in the stately movements. Her body turned, Slowly at first and then more swiftly as the dance ecstasy increased. Her long brown hair whipped around her face.\nThe two priests dared to lift their heads. The strange child was performing The Dance! They recognized the movements: The Dance of Propitiation. She asked Shai- hulud to forgive His people. She asked God to forgive them!\nThey turned their heads to look at each other and, together, rocked back onto their knees. There, they began clapping in the time-honored effort to distract the dancer. Their hands clapped rhythmically as they chanted the ancient words:\n“Our fathers ate manna in the desert,\n“In the burning places where whirlwinds came!”\nThe priests excluded from their attention all except the child. She was a slender thing, they saw, with stringy muscles, thin arms and legs. Her robe and stillsuit were worn and patched like those of the poorest. Her cheekbones had high planes that drew shadows across her olive skin. Brown eyes, they noted. Reddish sun streaks drew their lines in her hair. There was a water-spare sharpness about her features—the narrow nose and chin, the wide forehead, the wide thin mouth, the long neck. She looked like the Fremen portraits in the holy of holies at Dar-es-Balat. Of course! The child of Shai-hulud would look thus.\nShe danced well, too. Not the slightest quickly repeatable rhythm entered her movements. There was rhythm but it was an admirably long beat, at least a hundred steps apart. She kept it up while the sun lifted higher and higher. It was almost noon before she fell exhausted to the sand.\nThe priests stood and looked out into the desert where Shai-hulud had gone. The stampings of the dance had not summoned Him back. They were forgiven.\nThat was how Sheeana’s new life began.\nLoudly in their own quarters and for many days, the senior priests engaged in arguments about her. At last, they brought their disputations and reports to the High Priest, Hedley Tuek. They met in the afternoon within the Hall of Small Convocations, Tuek and six priestly councillors. Murals of Leto Il, a human face on the great wormshape, looked down upon them with benevolence.\nTuek seated himself on a stone bench that had been recovered from Windgap Sietch. Muad’Dib himself was reputed to have sat on this bench. One of the legs still bore the carvings of an Atreides hawk.\nHis councillors took lesser modern benches facing him.\nThe High Priest was an imposing figure; silky gray hair combed smoothly to his shoulders. It was a suitable frame\nfor the square face with its wide, thick mouth and heavy chin. Tuek’s eyes retained their original clear whites Surrounding dark blue pupils. Bushy, untrimmed gray eyebrows shaded his eyes.\nThe councillors were a motley lot. Scions of old priestly families, each carried in his heart the belief that matters would move better if he were sitting on Tuek’s bench.\nThe scrawny, pinch-faced Stiros put himself forward as opposition spokesman: “She is nothing but a poor desert waif and she rode Shai-hulud. That is forbidden and the punishment is mandatory.”\nOthers spoke up immediately. “No! No, Stiros. You have it wrong! She did not stand on Shai-hulud’s back as the Fremen did. She had no maker hooks or...”\nStiros tried to shout them down.\nIt was deadlocked, Tuek saw: three and three with Umphrud, a fat hedonist, as advocate for “cautious acceptance.”\n“She had no way to guide Shai-hulud’s course,” Umphrud argued. “We all saw how she came down to the sand unafraid and talked to Him.”\nYes, they all had seen that, either at the moment or in the holophoto that a thoughtful observer had recorded. Desert waif or not, she had confronted Shai-hulud and conversed with Him. And Shai-hulud had not engulfed her. No, indeed. The Worm-of-God had drawn back at the child’s command and had returned to the desert.\n“We will test her,” Tuek said.\nEarly the following morning, an ornithopter flown by the two priests who had brought her from the desert conveyed Sheeana far out away from the sight of Keen’s populace. The priests took her down to a dune top and planted a meticulous copy of a Fremen thumper in the sand. When the thumper’s catch was released, a heavy beating trembled through the desert—the ancient summons to Shai-hulud. The priests fled to their ’thopter and waited high overhead\nwhile a terrified Sheeana, her worst fears realized, stood alone some twenty meters from the thumper.\nTwo worms came. They were not the largest the priests had ever seen, no more than thirty meters long. One of them scooped up the thumper and silenced it. Together, they rounded in parallel tracks and stopped side by side not six meters from Sheeana.\nShe stood submissive, fists clenched at her sides. This was what priests did. They fed you to Shaitan.\nIn their hovering ‘thopter, the two priests watched with fascination. Their lenses transmitted the scene to equally fascinated observers in the High Priest’s quarters at Keen. All of them had seen similar events before. It was a standard punishment, a handy way to remove obstructionists from the populace or priesthood, or to pave the way for acquisition of a new concubine. Never before, though, had they seen a lone child as victim. And such a child!\nThe Worms-of-God crept forward slowly after their first stop. They became motionless once more when only about three meters from Sheeana.\nResigned to her fate, Sheeana did not run. Soon, she thought, she would be with her parents and friends. As the worms remained motionless, anger replaced her terror. The bad priests had left her here! She could hear their ‘thopter overhead. The hot spice smell from the worms filled the air around her. Abruptly, she raised her right hand and pointed up at the ‘thopter.\n“Go ahead and eat me! That’s what they want!”\nThe priests overhead could not hear her words but the gesture was visible and they could see that she was talking to the two Worms-of-God. The finger pointing up at them did not bode well.\nThe worms did not move.\nSheeana lowered her hand. “You killed my mother and father and all my friends!” she accused. She took a step forward and shook a fist at them.\nThe worms retreated, keeping their distance.\n“If you don’t want me, go back where you came from!” She waved them away toward the desert.\nObediently, they backed farther and turned in unison.\nThe priests in the ‘thopter tracked them until they slipped beneath the sand more than a kilometer away. Only then did the priests return, fear and trepidation in them. They plucked the child of Shai-hulud from the sand and returned her to Keen.\nThe Bene Gesserit embassy at Keen had a full report by nightfall. Word was on its way to the Chapter House by the following morning.\nIt had happened at last!\nThe trouble with some kinds of warfare (and be certain the Tyrant knew this, because it is implicit in his lesson) is that they destroy all moral decency in susceptible types. Warfare of these kinds will dump the destroyed survivors back into an innocent population that is incapable of even imagining what such returned soldiers might do.\n—TEACHINGS OF THE GOLDEN PATH, BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nO ne of Miles Teg’s early memories was of sitting at dinner with his parents and his younger brother, Sabine. Teg had been only seven at the time, but the events lay indelibly in his memory: the dining room on Lernaeus colorful with freshly cut flowers, the low light of the yellow sun diffused by antique shades. Bright blue dinnerware and glistening silver graced the table. Acolyte servants stood ready at hand, because his mother might be permanently detached on special duty but her function as a Bene Gesserit teacher was not to be wasted.\nJanet Roxbrough-Teg, a large-boned woman who appeared cast for the part of grande dame, looked down her nose from one end of the table, watching that the dinner service not be impaired by the slightest misplacement. Loschy Teg, Miles’ father, always observed this with a faint air of amusement. He was a thin man with high forehead, a face SO narrow his dark eyes appeared to bulge at the sides. His black hair was a perfect counterpoint for his wife’s fairness.\nAbove the subdued sounds at the table and the rich smell of spiced edu soup, his mother instructed his father on how to deal with an importunate Free Trader. When she said “Tleilaxu,” she had Miles’ entire attention. His", " and glistening silver graced the table. Acolyte servants stood ready at hand, because his mother might be permanently detached on special duty but her function as a Bene Gesserit teacher was not to be wasted.\nJanet Roxbrough-Teg, a large-boned woman who appeared cast for the part of grande dame, looked down her nose from one end of the table, watching that the dinner service not be impaired by the slightest misplacement. Loschy Teg, Miles’ father, always observed this with a faint air of amusement. He was a thin man with high forehead, a face SO narrow his dark eyes appeared to bulge at the sides. His black hair was a perfect counterpoint for his wife’s fairness.\nAbove the subdued sounds at the table and the rich smell of spiced edu soup, his mother instructed his father on how to deal with an importunate Free Trader. When she said “Tleilaxu,” she had Miles’ entire attention. His education had just recently touched on the Bene Tleilax.\nEven Sabine, who succumbed many years later to a poisoner on Romo, listened with as much of his four-year-old awareness as he could muster. Sabine hero-worshiped his brother. Anything that caught the attention of Miles was of interest to Sabine. Both boys listened silently.\n“The man is fronting for the Tleilaxu,” Lady Janet said. “l can hear it in his voice.”\n“I do not doubt your ability to detect such things, my dear,” Loschy Teg said. “But what am | to do? He has the proper tokens of credit and he wishes to buy the—”\n“The order for the rice is unimportant at the moment. Never assume that what a Face Dancer appears to seek is actually what it seeks.”\n“I’m sure he’s not a Face Dancer. He—”\n“Loschy! | know you have learned this well at my instruction and can detect a Face Dancer. | agree that the Free Trader is not one of them. The Face Dancers remain on his ship. They know I am here.”\n“They know they could not fool you. Yes, but—”\n“Tleilaxu strategy is always woven within a web of strategies, any one of which may be the real strategy. They learned that from us.”\n“My dear, if we are dealing with Tleilaxu, and | do not question your judgment, then it immediately becomes a question of melange.”\nLady Janet nodded her head gently. Indeed, even Miles knew about the Tleilaxu connection with the spice. It was one of the things that fascinated him about the Tleilaxu. For every milligram of melange produced on Rakis, the Bene Tleilax tanks produced long tons. Use of melange had grown to fit the new supply and even the Spacing Guild bent its knee before this power.\n“But the rice...” Loschy Teg ventured.\n“My dear husband, the Bene Tleilax have no need of that much pongi rice in our sector. They require it for trade. We must find out who really needs the rice.”\n“You want me to delay,” he said.\n“Precisely. You are superb at what we now require. Don’t give that Free Trader the chance to say yes or no. Someone trained by the Face Dancers will appreciate such subtlety.”\n“We lure the Face Dancers out of the ship while you initiate inquiries elsewhere.”\nLady Janet smiled. “You are lovely when you leap ahead of me that way.”\nA look of understanding passed between them.\n“He cannot go to another supplier in this sector,” Loschy Teg said.\n“He will wish to avoid a go, no-go confrontation,” Lady Janet said, patting the table. “Delay, delay, and more delay. You must draw the Face Dancers out of the ship.”\n“They will realize, of course.”\n“Yes, my dear, and it is dangerous. You must always meet on your own ground and with our own guards nearby.”\nMiles Teg recalled that his father had, indeed, drawn the Face Dancers out of their ship. His mother had taken Miles to the viewer where he watched the copper-walled room in which his father drove the bargain that won CHOAM’s highest commendation and a rich bonus.\nThe first Face Dancers Miles Teg ever saw: Two small men as alike as twins. Almost chinless round faces, pug noses, tiny mouths, black button eyes, and short-cropped white hair that stood up from their heads like the bristles on a brush. The two were dressed as the Free Trader had been— black tunics and trousers.\n“Illusion, Miles,” his mother said. “Illusion is their way. The fashioning of illusion to achieve real goals, that is how the Tleilaxu work.”\n“Like the magician at the Winter Show?” Miles asked, his gaze intent on the viewer and its toy-figure scene.\n“Quite similar,” his mother agreed. She too watched the viewer as she spoke but one arm went protectively around her son’s shoulders.\n“You are looking at evil, Miles. Study it carefully. The faces you see can be changed in an instant. They can grow taller, appear heavier. They could mimic your father so that only | would recognize the substitution.”\nMiles Teg’s mouth formed a soundless “O.” He stared at the viewer, listening to his father explain that the price of CHOAM’s pongi rice once more had gone up alarmingly.\n“And the most terrible thing of all,” his mother said. “Some of the newer Face Dancers can, by touching the flesh of a victim, absorb some of the victim’s memories.”\n“They read minds?” Miles looked up at his mother.\n“Not exactly. We think they take a print of the memories, almost a holophoto process. They do not yet know that we are aware of this.”\nMiles understood. He was not to speak of this to anyone, not even to his father or his mother. She had taught him the Bene Gesserit way of secrecy. He watched the figures in the screen with care.\nAt his father’s words, the Face Dancers betrayed no emotion, but their eyes appeared to glitter more brightly.\n“How did they get so evil?” Miles asked.\n“They are communal beings, bred not to identify with any Shape or face. The appearance they present now is for my benefit. They know | am watching. They have relaxed into their natural communal shape. Mark it closely.”\nMiles tipped his head to one side and studied the Face Dancers. They looked so bland and ineffectual.\n“They have no sense of self,” his mother said. “They have only the instinct to preserve their own lives unless ordered to die for their masters.”\n“Would they do that?”\n“They have done it many times.”\n“Who are their masters?”\n“Men who seldom leave the planets of the Bene Tleilax.”\n“Do they have children?”\n“Not Face Dancers. They are mules, sterile. But their masters can breed. We have taken a few of them but the offspring are strange. Few female births and even then we cannot probe their Other Memories.”\nMiles frowned. He knew his mother was a Bene Gesserit. He knew the Reverend Mothers carried a marvelous reservoir of Other Memories going back through all the millennia of the Sisterhood. He even knew something of the Bene Gesserit breeding design. Reverend Mothers chose particular men and had children by those men.\n“What are the Tleilaxu women like?” Miles asked.\nIt was a perceptive question that sent a surge of pride through the Lady Janet. Yes, it was almost a certainty that she had a potential Mentat here. The breeding mistresses had been right about the gene potential of Loschy Teg.\n“No one outside of their planets has ever reported seeing a Tleilaxu female,” the Lady Janet said.\n“Do they exist or is it just the tanks?”\n“They exist.”\n“Are any of the Face Dancers women?”\n“At their own choice, they can be male or female. Observe them carefully. They know what your father is doing and it angers them.”\n“Will they try to hurt my father?”\n“They don’t dare. We have taken precautions and they know it. See how the one on the left works his jaws. That is one of their anger signs.”\n“You said they were com... communal beings.”\n“Like hive insects, Miles. They have no self-image. Without a sense of self, they go beyond amorality. Nothing they say or do can be trusted.”\nMiles shuddered.\n“We have never been able to detect an ethical code in them,” the Lady Janet said. “They are flesh made into automata. Without self, they have nothing to esteem or even doubt. They are bred only to obey their masters.”\n“And they were told to come here and buy the rice.”\n“Exactly. They were told to get it and there’s no other place in this sector where they can do that.”\n“They must buy it from father?”\n“He’s their only source. At this very moment, son, they are paying in melange. You see?”\nMiles saw the orange-brown spice markers change hands, a tall stack of them, which one of the Face Dancers removed from a case on the floor.\n“The price is far, far higher than they ever anticipated,” the Lady Janet said. “This will be an easy trail to follow.”\n“Why?”\n“Someone will be bankrupted acquiring that shipment. We think we know who the buyer is. Whoever it is, we will learn of it. Then we will know what was really being traded here.”\nLady Janet then began to point out the identifiable incongruities that betrayed a Face Dancer to trained eyes and ears. They were subtle signs but Miles picked up on them immediately. His mother told him then that she thought he might become a Mentat. .. perhaps even more.\nShortly before his thirteenth birthday, Miles Teg was sent away to advanced schooling at the Bene Gesserit stronghold on Lampadas, where his mother’s assessment of him was confirmed. Word went back to her:\n“You have given us the Warrior Mentat we had hoped for.”\nTeg did not see this note until sorting through his mother’s effects after her death. The words inscribed ona Small sheet of ridulian crystal with the Chapter House imprint below them filled him with an odd sense of displacement in time. His memory put him suddenly back on Lampadas where the love-awe he had felt for his mother was deftly transferred to the Sisterhood itself, as originally intended. He had come to understand this only during his later Mentat training but the understanding changed little. If anything, it bound him even more strongly to the Bene\nGesserit. It confirmed that the Sisterhood must be one of his strengths. He already knew that the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood was one of the most powerful forces in his universe—equal at least to the Spacing Guild, superior to the Fish Speaker Council that had inherited the core of the old Atreides Empire, superior by far to CHOAM, and balanced somehow with the Fabricators of Ix and with the Bene Tleilax. A small measure of the Sisterhood’s far- reaching authority could be deduced from the fact that they held this authority despite Tleilaxu tank-grown melange, which had broken the Rakian monopoly on the spice, just as Ixian navigation machines had broken the Guild monopoly on space travel.\nMiles Teg knew his history well by then. Guild Navigators no longer were the only ones who could thread a ship through the folds of space—in this galaxy one instant, ina faraway galaxy the very next heartbeat.\nThe School Sisters held back little from him, revealing there for the first time the fact of his Atreides ancestry. That revelation was necessary because of the tests they gave him. They obviously were testing for prescience. Could he, like a Guild Navigator, detect fatal obstructions?

That revelation was necessary because of the tests they gave him. They obviously were testing for prescience. Could he, like a Guild Navigator, detect fatal obstructions? He failed. They tried him next on no-chambers and no-ships. He was as blind to such devices as the rest of humankind. For this test, though, they fed him increased doses of the spice and he sensed the awakening of his True Self.\n“The Mind at Its Beginning,” a teaching Sister called it when he asked for an explanation of this odd sensation.\nFor a time, the universe was magical as he looked at it through this new awareness. His awareness was a Circle, then a globe. Arbitrary forms became transient. He fell into trance state without warning until the Sisters taught him how to control this. They provided him with accounts of saints and mystics and forced him to draw a freehand circle with either hand, following the line with his awareness.\nBy the end of the term, his awareness resumed its touch with conventional labels, but the memory of the magic never left him. He found that memory a source of strength at the most difficult moments.\nAfter accepting the assignment as Weapons Master to the ghola, Teg found his magical memory increasingly with him. It was especially useful during his first interview with Schwangyu at the Keep on Gammu. They met in the Reverend Mother’s study, a place of shiny metal walls and numerous instruments, most of them with the stamp of Ix on them. Even the chair in which she sat, the morning sun coming through a window behind her and making her face difficult to see, even that chair was one of the Ixian self- molders. He was forced to sit in a chairdog, though he realized she must know he detested the use of any life form for such a demeaning task.\n“You were chosen because you actually are a grandfatherly figure,” Schwangyu said. The bright sunlight formed a corona around her hooded head. Deliberate! “Your wisdom will earn the child’s love and respect.”\n“There’s no way | could be a father figure.”\n“According to Taraza, you have the precise characteristics she requires. | know of your honorable scars and their value to us.”\nThis only reconfirmed his previous Mentat summation: They have been planning this for a long time. They have bred for it. | was bred for it. | am part of their larger plan.\nAll he said was: “Taraza expects this child to become a redoubtable warrior when restored to his true self.”\nSchwangyu merely stared at him for a moment, then: “You must not answer any of his questions about gholas, should he encounter the subject. Do not even use the word until | give you permission. We will supply you with all of the ghola data your duties require.”\nColdly parceling out his words for emphasis, Teg said: “Perhaps the Reverend Mother was not informed that | am\nwell versed in the lore of Tleilaxu gholas. | have met Tleilaxu in battle.”\n“You think you know enough about the Idaho series?”\n“The Idahos are reputed to have been brilliant military strategists,” Teg said.\n“Then perhaps the great Bashar was not informed about the other characteristics of our ghola.”\nNo doubt of the mockery in her voice. Something else as well: jealousy and great anger poorly concealed. Teg’s mother had taught him ways of reading through her own masks, a forbidden teaching, which he had always concealed. He feigned chagrin and shrugged.\nIt was obvious, though, that Schwangyu knew he was Taraza’s Bashar. The lines had been drawn.\n“At Bene Gesserit behest,” Schwangyu said, “the Tleilaxu have made a significant alteration in the present Idaho series. His nerve-muscle system has been modernized.”\n“Without changing the original persona?” Teg fed the question to her blandly, wondering how far she would go in revelation.\n“He is a ghola, not a clone!”\n“| see.”\n“Do you really? He requires the most careful prana-bindu training at all stages.”\n“Taraza’s orders exactly,” Teg said. “And we will all obey those orders.”\nSchwangyu leaned forward, not concealing her anger. “You have been asked to train a ghola whose role in certain plans is most dangerous to us all. | don’t think you even remotely understand what you will train!”\nWhat you will train, Teg thought. Not whom. This ghola- child would never be a whom for Schwangyu or any of the others who opposed Taraza. Perhaps the ghola would not be a whom to anyone until restored to his original self, firmly seated in that original Duncan Idaho identity.\nTeg saw clearly now that Schwangyu harbored more than hidden reservations about the ghola project. She was in active opposition just as Taraza had warned. Schwangyu was the enemy and Taraza’s orders had been explicit.\n“You will protect that child against any threat.”\nTen thousand years since Leto II began his metamorphosis from human into the sandworm of Rakis and historians still argue over his motives. Was he driven by the desire for long life? He lived more than ten times the normal span of three hundred SY, but consider the price he paid. Was it the lure of power? He is called the Tyrant for good reason but what did power bring him that a human might want? Was he driven to save humankind from itself? We have only his own words about his Golden Path to answer this and | cannot accept the self-serving records of Dar-es-Balat. Might there have been other gratifications, which only his experiences would illuminate? Without better evidence the question is moot. We are reduced to saying only that “He did it!” The physical fact alone is undeniable.\n—THE METAMORPHOSIS OF LETO II, 10,000TH ANNIVERSARY PERORATION BY GAUS ANDAUD\nO nce more, Waff knew he was on lashkar. This time the stakes were as high as they could go. An Honored Matre from the Scattering demanded his presence. A powindah of powindahs! Descendants of Tleilaxu from the Scattering had told him all they could about these terrible women.\n“Far more terrible than Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit,” they said.\nAnd more numerous, Waff reminded himself.\nHe did not fully trust the returned Tleilaxu descendants, either. Their accents were strange, their manners even stranger and their observances of the rituals questionable. How could they be readmitted to the Great Kehl? What possible rite of ghufran could cleanse them after all these centuries? It was beyond belief that they had kept the Tleilaxu secret down the generations.\nThey were no longer malik-brothers and yet they were the only source of information the Tleilaxu possessed about these returning Lost Ones. And the revelations they had brought! Revelations that had been incorporated in the\nDuncan Idaho gholas—that was worth all of the risks of contamination by powindah evil.\nThe meeting place with the Honored Matres was the presumed neutrality of an Ixian no-ship that held a tight orbit around a mutually selected gas giant planet ina mined-out solar system of the old Imperium. The Prophet himself had drained the last of the wealth from this system. New Face Dancers walked as Ixians among the no-ship’s crew but Waff still sweated the first encounter. If these Honored Matres were truly more terrible than the Bene Gesserit witches, would the exchange of Face Dancers for Ixian crewmen be detected?\nSelection of this meeting place and the arrangements had put a strain on the Tleilaxu. Was it secure? He reassured himself that he carried two sealed weapons never before seen off the Tleilaxu core planets. The weapons were the painstaking result of long effort by his artificers: two minuscule dart throwers concealed in his sleeves. He had trained with them for years until the flipping of the sleeves and the discharge of the poisoned darts was almost an instinctive reflex.\nThe walls of the meeting room were properly copper- toned, evidence that they were shielded from Ixian spy devices. But what instruments might the people of the Scattering have developed beyond the Ixian ken?\nWaff entered the room with a hesitant step. The Honored Matre already was there seated in a leather sling chair.\n“You will call me what everyone else calls me,” she greeted him. “Honored Matre.”\nHe bowed as he had been warned to do. “Honored Matre.”\nNo hint of hidden powers in her voice. A low contralto with overtones that spoke of disdain for him. She looked like an aged athlete or acrobat, slowed and retired but still maintaining her muscle tone and some of her skills. Her face was tight skin over a skull with prominent cheekbones. The\nthin-lipped mouth produced a sense of arrogance when she spoke, as though every word were projected downward onto lesser folk.\n“Well, come in and sit down!” she commanded, waving at a sling chair facing her.\nWaff heard the hatch hiss closed behind him. He was alone with her! She was wearing a snooper. He could see the lead for it going into her left ear. His dart throwers had been sealed and “washed” against snoopers, then maintained at minus 340° Kelvin in a radiation bath for five SY to make them proof against snoopers. Had it been enough?\nGently, he lowered himself into the indicated chair.\nOrange-tinted contact lenses covered the Honored Matre’s eyes, giving them a feral appearance. She was altogether daunting. And her clothing! Red leotards beneath a dark blue cape. The surface of the cape had been decorated with some pearly material to produce strange arabesques and dragon designs. She sat in the chair as though it were a throne, her clawlike hands resting easily on the arms.\nWaff glanced around the room. His people had inspected this place in company with Ixian maintenance workers and representatives of the Honored Matre.\nWe have done our best, he thought, and he tried to relax.\nThe Honored Matre laughed.\nWaff stared at her with as calm an expression as he could muster. “You are gauging me now,” he accused. “You say to yourself that you have enormous resources to employ against me, subtle and gross instruments to carry out your commands.”\n“Do not take that tone with me.” The words were low and flat but carried such a weight of venom that Waff almost recoiled.\nHe stared at the stringy muscles of the woman’s legs, that deep red leotard fabric which flowed over her skin as\nthough it were organic to her.\nTheir meeting time had been adjusted to bring them together at a mutually personal mid-morning, their waking hours having been balanced en route. Waff felt dislocated, though, and at a disadvantage. What if the stories of his informants were true?
