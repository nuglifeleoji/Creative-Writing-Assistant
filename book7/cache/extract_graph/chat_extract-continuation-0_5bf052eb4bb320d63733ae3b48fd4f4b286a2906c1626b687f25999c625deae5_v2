  “那就来杯啤酒吧。”草S回答。\n    “这样没关系吗”等服务生离开后，岸谷问道，“我们正在执勤耶。”\n    “如果我们不喝点什么，其他的客人会起疑心。”   \n    “那喝乌龙茶不就好了。”\n    “两个大男人，会为了喝乌龙茶跑来这种店吗？”\n    正当两人这么斗嘴之际，一名身穿银灰色套装、年约四十的女子出现了。浓妆艳抹头发高高挽起。虽然很瘦，仍不失为一个美女。\n    “欢迎光临，不知有何贵干？”女人压低了声音问，唇角流露出笑意。\n    “我们是警视厅的人。”草S也低声回答。\n    一旁的岸谷把手伸进西装内裤，草S制止他后，再次看着女人。“应该拿出证件证明身份比较好吗？”\n    “不，不用了。”她在草S身旁坐下，同时放下名片，上面印着“杉村园子”。\n    “你是这里的妈妈桑吧？”\n    “名义上算是。”杉村园子微笑点头，看来她无意掩饰自己受人雇佣的身份。\n    “生意挺不错的嘛。”草S环视店内说。\n    “那只是外表，这间店是老板开来节税用的。就连捧场的客人，也都是和老板有关的人。”\n    “这样子啊。”\n    “像这种店，谁晓得哪一天会变成怎样。也许小代子选择开便当店才是正确的。”\n    虽然说的很低调，但爽快提到前任者名字的态度，令草S感到她还是自有她的尊严。\n    “之前，我们的刑警应该已经来打扰好几次了。”\n    园子颌首。\n    “为了富坚先生的事，来过好多次了，多半都是由我出面。今天还是为了那件事吗？”\n    “不好意思，再三叨扰。”\n    “我也跟之前来的刑警先生说过了。如果怀疑靖子，那你们肯定搞错了，因为她根本没有杀人动机。”\n    “不，谈不上怀疑。”草S堆出笑容，摇手说，“因为搜查迟迟没有进展，所以我们只好换个想法重新开始，所以才会来拜访你。”\n    “重新开始啊。”杉村园子小小吐出一口气。\n    “听说富坚慎二先生在三月五日那天来过。”\n    “是的。好久不见了，况且，也没想到那个人事到如今还会来这里，所以我吓了一大跳。”\n    “你以前就见过他吗？”\n    “只有两次。我以前也在赤坂，和靖子在同一家店上班。那时，曾经见过他。当时那个人手头很阔绰，穿着打扮也很气派……”\n    她的语气似乎表示，久别重逢的富坚已经了无昔日风采。\n    “富坚慎二先生好像很想知道花冈小姐的下落，是吧？”\n
