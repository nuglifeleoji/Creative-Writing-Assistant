\n　　为了让大家安静，准备大发脾气的杨高虎立刻站起来——没想到坐在另一头的孙玉亭，由于板凳失去平衡，一个马趴栽倒在了地上，把桌子上的一杯茶水都打翻了。全场人于是一齐哄笑起来。 \n　　栽倒在地的玉亭同志，在大家的哄笑声中镇定地爬起来，把板凳放好，脸定得平平地又重新坐了上去。 \n　　杨高虎看玉亭坐好了，就马上挤过去，在徐治功那边的桌上，拿起话筒大声喊叫：“民兵小分队请注意！民兵小分队请注意！严防阶级敌人破坏捣乱！如发现坏人捣乱，立即扭送到台上来！” \n　　众人这才“刷”地平静下来了。大家马上意识到，这不是一个玩笑场所，而是一个大批判会。 \n　　在人圈外的民兵小分队，一个个都把枪松松垮垮倒背在肩上，枪里面谁也不敢装子弹，怕走火把好人伤了。在这种场所，这些人谁也不认真；庄前庄后的，不光他们本人，就是他们的老祖宗别人也知底，何必去惹人呢？其中几个不正相的光棍后生，不时酸眉醋眼瞄着金家那里的几个漂亮媳妇，使得这几个女人都面红耳赤地低下头，抠自己的手指头。 \n　　这时候，孙玉亭小心翼翼地站起来——他怕再把另一头坐着的杨高虎又闪倒在地——就绕到徐治功这边来了。他胳膊肘撑在桌子边上，斜着身子在徐主任旁边的话筒上吹了一口气，又用手指头弹了弹——听见远处墙角的喇叭里传来“嘣嘣”的几声，似乎证明扩音器没有被刚才杨高虎的大嗓门震坏。接着，玉亭便尽量提高自己有些沙哑的嗓音（因吃肉口渴），说：“把阶级敌人带上来！” \n　　这一下，人群又一次骚乱起来，响起一片嗡嗡的说话声；有些坐着的人也纷纷站起来了。民兵小分队的人赶忙连喊带吼，让众人坐下来，不要喧哗吵闹！ \n　　下山村那个扛枪的民兵，把十几个被劳教的“阶级敌人”带出来了。走在最前面的，就是今天刚拉回来的王满银。院子北边双水村的人又乱纷纷的了。他们指着兰花的女婿，议论成了一窝蜂。 \n　　满银此刻很不自在，脸上无光地耷拉着脑袋——这是在老丈人村里丢脸现丑，满院子都是熟人啊！ \n　　当牛家沟那个“母老虎”出现在众人面前时，妇女们立刻指划着议论起来。这位“母老虎”倒的确有点“虎”气，她站在那里，仰�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
