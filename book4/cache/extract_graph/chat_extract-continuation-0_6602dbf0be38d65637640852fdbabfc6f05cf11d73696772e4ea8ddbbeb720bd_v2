\n　　少安决定，等明年天暖后，不管秀莲怎反对，他一定要带她去黄原或省城去看病！ \n　　这一天晚上，少安回家后不多功夫，就被父亲有点神秘地把他从家里叫到院子里。 \n　　“什么事？”少安惊慌地问。他看见父亲一脸的诡秘。 \n　　孙玉厚就把刘玉升要重建庙宇的事给儿子大约说了说。“我已经上了二十块布施。我听玉升的意思，想叫你多出点哩，因为你这二年赚了几个钱……”孙玉厚咄咄地对儿子说。 \n　　孙少安有些生气地巴咂了一下嘴，对父亲说：“哎呀，我怎能出这号钱哩？就是你也不应该出！” \n　　玉厚老汉对儿子的态度大为惊讶。 \n　　“你娃娃不敢这样！神神鬼鬼的事，谁也说不来！咱又不在乎那么两个钱。万一……” \n　　“万一怎？”少安看着父亲的可怜相，强硬地说：“我不会出这钱！哪里有什么神神鬼鬼！神鬼就是刘玉升和金光亮！他们愿干啥哩，和咱屁不相干！” \n　　玉厚老汉见儿子如此不恭神灵，急得两只手索索地抖着，不知该怎样指教这个造孽的逆子……第二天上午，少安本来要去石圪节砖瓦厂，但他无意间产生了一个小小的愿望——想到金家湾那面去转一转，瞧瞧他的宝贝儿子。 \n　　虎子这半年已经上了小学一年级，他很想在外面悄悄看看儿子坐在教室里的样子。是啊，他的儿子也上学了！由此他又想起了自己当年上学的情景，心里不免有点酸楚。现在，心爱的儿子再不象他当年一样，为上学而受那么多的委屈和折磨。虎子，只要你爱念书，哪怕将来到美国去上学爸也要把你供出来！ \n　　孙少安怀着一种惆怅而激动的情绪，一个人慢慢遛达着，淌过东拉河，走过初冬荒凉的庙坪，跨过了哭咽河上的那座小桥。他一副游手好闲的样子——他也好长时间没有这种闲情逸致了。 \n　　他习惯地走到原来的学校院子，却猛然意识到：学校已搬进了原二队的饲养院里！ \n　　不过，他倒一下子无法把自己的双脚从这个破败的老学校的院子里挪出来。 \n　　他看见，这个当年全村最有生气的地方，竟是这样的荒芜衰败了！院子里蒿草长了一人高；窑面墙到处都是裂缝，麻雀在裂缝中垒窝筑巢，叽叽喳喧，飞进飞出，那副篮球架已经腐朽不�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
