It was a pivotal political and military center for 曹操's state, which was known as Wei. The city played a crucial role during the late Eastern Han dynasty, where it became the heart of 曹操's power base.\n\nAs the capital of 曹操's territory, 许都 was the site of important political maneuvers and military strategies. It hosted significant meetings where alliances were formed and military strategies were discussed. Notably, it was where urgent messages were sent by military leaders, such as 刘延 (Liu Yan), highlighting its importance in communication and coordination during times of conflict.\n\n许都 was also a strategic location for military forces, including those of 夏侯惇 (Xiahou Dun), who stationed his troops there. The city was not only a center for military operations but also a place where diplomatic activities took place, as evidenced by figures like 张松 (Zhang Song) who traveled to 许都 for diplomatic missions.\n\nThe city was characterized by its political significance, serving as a backdrop for various plots and actions against 曹操, including the return of 吉邈 (Ji Miao) and 吉穆 (Ji Mu) who planned to act against him. Furthermore, it was a location where key figures, such as 杨阜 (Yang Fu), were sent to meet 曹操, underscoring its role as a hub for political and military leadership.\n\nIn summary, 许都 was not only the capital of 曹操's state but also a vital center for political and military activities during the tumultuous period of the Three Kingdoms, making it a significant historical city in Chinese history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898591, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 371, "prompt_tokens": 529, "total_tokens": 900, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
