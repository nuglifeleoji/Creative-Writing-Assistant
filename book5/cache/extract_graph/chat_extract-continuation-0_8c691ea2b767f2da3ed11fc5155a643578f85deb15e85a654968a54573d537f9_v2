“在量子力学的教学中，你也散布过大量的反动言论!”说完对绍琳点点头，示意她继续。\n　　绍琳迫不及待地要继续下去了，她必须不停顿地说下去，以维持自己那摇摇欲坠的精神免于彻底垮掉。“叶哲泰，这一点你是无法抵赖的!你多次向学生散布反动的哥本哈根解释!”\n　　“这毕竟是目前公认的最符合实验结果的解释。”叶哲泰说，在受到如此重击后，他的口气还如此从容，这让绍琳很吃惊，也很恐惧。\n　　“这个解释认为，是外部的观察导致了量子波函数的坍缩，这是反动唯心论的另一种表现形式，而且是一种最猖狂的表现!”\n　　“是哲学指引实验还是实验指引哲学?”叶哲泰问道，他这突然的反击令批判者们一时不知所措。\n　　“当然是正确的马克思主义哲学指引科学实验!”一名男红卫兵说。\n　　“这等于说正确的哲学是从天上掉下来的，这反对实践出真知，恰恰是违背马克思主义对自然界的认知原则的。”\n　　绍琳和两名大学红卫兵无言以对，与中学和社会上的红卫兵不同，他们不可能一点儿道理也不讲。但来自附中的四位小将自有她们“无坚不摧”的革命方式，刚才动手的那个女孩儿又狠抽了叶哲泰一皮带，另外三个女孩子也都分别抡起皮带抽了一下，当同伴革命时，她们必须表现得更革命，至少要同样革命。两名男红卫兵没有过问，他们要是现在管这事，也有不革命的嫌疑。\n　　“你还在教学中散布宇宙大爆炸理论，这是所有科学理论中最反动的一个!”一名男红卫兵试图转移话题。\n　　“也许以后这个理论会被推翻，但本世纪的两大宇宙学发现：哈勃红移和3K宇宙背景辐射，使大爆炸学说成为目前为止最可信的宇宙起源理论。”\n　　“胡说!”绍琳大叫起来，又接着滔滔不绝地讲起了宇宙大爆炸，自然不忘深刻地剖析其反动本质。但这理论的超级新奇吸引了四个小女孩儿中最聪明的那一个，她不由自主地问道： “连时间都是从那个奇点开始的!?那奇点以前有什么?”\n　　“什么都没有。”叶哲泰说，像回答任何一个小女孩儿的问题那样，他转头慈祥地看着她，铁高帽和已受的重伤，使他这动作很艰难。\n　　“什么……都没有?!反动!反动透顶!!”那女孩儿惊恐万状地大叫起来，她不知所措地转向绍琳寻求帮助，立刻得到了。\n　　“这给上帝的存在留下了位置。”绍琳对女孩儿点点头提示说。\n　　小红卫兵那茫然的思路立刻找到了立脚点，她举起紧握皮带的手指着�\n######################\nOutput:",
