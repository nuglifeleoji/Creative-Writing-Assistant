如同一匹浆洗过的青布。在庙坪那边，枣子已经红透，在绿叶黄叶间象玛瑙似的闪耀着红艳艳的光亮……少安吸着自卷的旱烟卷，过了东拉河的列石，上了庙坪，穿过这片叫人嘴馋的枣树林。 \n　　他正在枣树林间的小土路上走着，路上面的地畔上有个妇女问他：“你回来了？” \n　　少安抬头一看，原来正是俊斌的媳妇王彩娥。他不由地心一沉，想对这不幸的寡妇说几句安慰话，但急忙又不知说什么是好。 \n　　他想了一下，也不能提俊斌的事，就只好问彩娥：“你干什么哩？” \n　　彩娥不象少安估计到的那样悲伤，她甚至对少安笑了笑，说：“我照枣着哩！你二爸给我安排了这个轻省活……你吃枣不？”彩娥说着，就用手摇了摇地畔上的一棵枣树，熟透的红枣子就劈里啪啦在少安周围落了许多。彩娥说：“你都拾上！现在这周围没人看见！” \n　　虽说彩娥这是好意，但少安心里隐隐地有些不舒服。他没想到俊斌死了才一个来月，彩娥就已经恢复得这么“正常”了。 \n　　少安看来不拾也不行，就匆忙地拣了一些枣子，装在自己衣袋里，说：“我还忙着哩……”就急忙走了。 \n　　当过了哭咽河的小桥，走到学校下面的时候，见他二爸正手里握着一卷子报纸和材料，从学校的小土坡上走下来。他二爸先开口给他打招呼说：“唉呀，我忙得还没顾上去你们家，听凤英说秀莲也跟你回来了，好嘛！” \n　　少安只好停住脚步，等他二爸走下来。 \n　　他二爸走到他当前，扬了扬手中的报纸说：“我正忙着准备政治夜校的学习哩！你大概知道了，《人民日报》八月三十一日发表了评《水浒》的重要文章。我刚从公社开会回来，上面号召要在政治夜校好好组织批判哩……” \n　　少安说：“我不知道这些事。批《水浒》的什么哩？”他二爸胸脯一挺，说：“嘿，毛主席都发指示了！说《水浒》这部书，好就好在投降。做反面教材，使人民都知道投降派。还说《水浒》只反贪官，不反皇帝。除晁盖于一百零八人之外。宋江投降，搞修正主义，把晁盖的聚义厅改为忠义堂，让人招安了……” \n　　少安心烦意乱，不愿听他二爸背诵毛主席语录，说他要去找一下金俊武，就准备走了。但他二爸突然又有点忧伤地说：“……唉！我们也应该请秀莲和你到我们家吃一顿饭，这是老乡俗……可你知道我家里的那个烂滩场！夏天分的一点麦子都叫你二妈在石圪节粮站换成了粮票，说公\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
