She is portrayed as the childhood friend of the narrator, whom the father hopes his child will marry. Elizabeth is not only the narrator's beloved but also his fiancée, with whom he shares profound feelings and hopes for a future together. Despite her vibrant spirit, Elizabeth has faced significant hardships, including a severe illness from scarlet fever, which she ultimately overcame. However, her life is marked by sorrow, particularly due to the death of her brother, which has left her feeling guilty and responsible for the tragedy.\n\nIn the context of her relationships, Elizabeth is depicted as a caring and compassionate individual who provides comfort to others, showcasing her courage and warmth. She is described as lovely and gentle, often moved to tears by the narrator's suffering. Her nurturing nature extends to her family and friends, including her cousin Justine, whom she supports during her trials, firmly believing in her innocence despite the overwhelming circumstances.\n\nElizabeth's character also embodies a tragic element, as she ultimately meets a grim fate within the narrative. Her death is a pivotal moment that profoundly affects the narrator, leading to his father's emotional collapse. The memories of Elizabeth linger in the narrator's mind, as he recalls her voice and the love they shared, even after her passing. This enduring connection highlights her role as a source of peace and comfort in his life.\n\nAdditionally, Elizabeth is involved in various social dynamics, including her relationship with Clerval, who considers her feelings when dealing with sensitive matters.

In another context, the wedding is a pivotal event for Elizabeth and her partner, symbolizing a major milestone in their lives that they are eagerly preparing for. This preparation reflects the emotional weight and importance that weddings hold for individuals.\n\nThe narrator expresses a deep desire for a wedding ceremony with Elizabeth, viewing it as a sacred union that should not be postponed due to external threats. This sentiment underscores the significance of the wedding as a celebration of love and commitment, despite the challenges that may arise. However, the narrator also grapples with feelings of distress due to unfulfilled promises, which complicates the anticipation of this joyous occasion.\n\nIn a darker narrative, the wedding of Victor Frankenstein and Elizabeth serves as a critical moment in Mary Shelley's \"\"Frankenstein.\"\" This wedding is set to occur in ten days, but it is tragically marred by the presence of the creature, who ultimately disrupts the ceremony by killing Elizabeth. This act not only highlights the themes of loss and tragedy but also serves as a commentary on the consequences of Victor's actions and the monstrous creation he has brought into the world.\n\nOverall, the entity \"\"婚礼\"\" encapsulates a range of emotions and events, from the hopeful preparations for a union to the tragic outcomes that can arise from love and ambition.
