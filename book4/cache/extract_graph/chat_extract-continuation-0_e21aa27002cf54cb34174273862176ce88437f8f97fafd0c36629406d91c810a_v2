查身体时，本来我血压不高，但由于心情紧张，高压上了一百六十五。这是你为我量的……”“噢……”女大夫似乎有所记忆。“当然，你说的这种情况是有的。正因为这样，我们才对血压不合格的人，还要进行第二次复查……” \n　　“那可是最后一次复查了！”少平叫道。 \n　　“是最后一次了。”女大夫平静地说。 \n　　“如果还不合格呢？” \n　　“当然要退回原地！” \n　　“不！我不回去！”少平冲动地大声叫起来，眼里已经旋转着泪水。 \n　　这时，女大夫的丈夫在门口探进头看了看，生气地白了少平一眼，然后把门“啪”地带住了。 \n　　女大夫本人现在只是带着惊讶的神色望着他。她说不出什么来。她显然被他这一声哈姆雷特式的悲怆的喊叫所震慑。少平自己也知道失礼了，赶忙轻声说：“对不起……”他用手掌揩去额头的汗水，又把手上的汗水揩在胸前的衣襟上。他哀求说：“大夫，你一定要帮助我，不要把我打发回去。我知道，我的命运就掌握在你的手里。你将决定我的生活道路，决定我的一生。这是千真万确的！” \n　　“你原来是干什么的？”女大夫突然问。 \n　　“揽工……在黄原揽了好长时间的工。” \n　　“上过学没有？” \n　　“上过。高中毕业，在农村教过书。” \n　　“当过教师？” \n　　“嗯。” \n　　“那你……” \n　　“大夫，我一时难以说清我的一切。我家几辈子都是农民。我好不容易才来到这里。煤矿虽然苦一些，但我不怕这地方苦。我多么希望能在这里劳动。听说有的人下几回井就跑了。我不会，大夫。你要知道，这是我的最后一次机会。你要相信，我的血压一点都不高，说不定是你的血压计出了毛病……” \n　　“血压计怎会出毛病呢！”女大夫嘴角不由露出一丝笑意。 \n　　这一丝笑意对少平来说，就象阴霾的天空突然出现了太阳的光芒！ \n　　“你说的我都知道了。你回去。明天复查时，你不要紧张……” \n　　“万一再紧张呢？” \n　　女大夫这次完全被他的话逗笑了。她从藤椅里站起来，在茶几上提起那几斤苹果，一边往他手里递，一边说：“你把东西带走。明早复查前一小时，你试着喝点醋……”孙少平一怔。 \n　　他猛地转过身，没有接苹果，急速地走出了房子。他不愿让大夫看见他夺眶而出的泪水。他在心里说：“好人，谢谢你！” \n　　他绊绊磕磕下了楼道，重新回到马路上。 \n　　他解开上衣的钮扣，让秋夜的凉风吹拂他热烘烘的胸脯。现在他脑子里是一片模糊的空白。他只记着一个字：醋！ \n　　他立刻来到矿部前，但看见所有店铺的门都关了。 \n　　他发愁地立在马路边\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>女大夫<|>PERSON<|>The female doctor is a medical professional who is assessing the health
