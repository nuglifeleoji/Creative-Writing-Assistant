\n　　同情心使我忍不住停住了脚步。只见我旁边的一张椅子上蜷曲着一位老人——正是他在反复喃喃地念叨着刚才我听见的那句话。他衣服虽不十分破烂，但蓬头垢面的，并且看来身体有病，使得面容十分苍老和衰败。不像是乞丐，因为我看见他手里捏着买车票的钱。是串乡说书的民间艺人吧？但又不见带着三弦。我想：总之，这大根是一个无力去排队买票的人。 \n　　当我认真朝他脸上看去的时候，我才认出这是一个盲人！ \n　　我顿时感到一种愤愤不平了。当然我首先气愤这个汽车站——竟然不能解决这样一些完全应该解决的问题。但我更气愤这个候车室里的人。在这些人之中，竟然没有一个肯为这不幸的老人帮忙的！ \n　　这种庄亚的思考当然首先感动了我自己。我想我应当帮助这个老人。 \n　　我瞅了一眼去桃县的售票口：正好！８０３次和８０２次的售票口紧挨着，并且车次牌上写着“增加两辆车”的字样。我急急忙忙赶了过去。 \n　　我在两条队伍的末尾，犹豫了一下：先排哪个队呢？如果现在去给那个瞎眼老头排队买票，我自己的票十有八九买不上了。我将不得不垂头丧气的滚回单位。但如果我要是先给自己买票，那老头的票也把握不大了。 \n　　我内心里不觉隐隐升起了一股懊丧的情绪：呀！你自己仓地为自己选择了一个难题。很快，我又谴责自己的这种情绪了：是的，你的确没有为那个不幸的老人公开承诺什么，但你在心灵中不是把某种责任担了吗？你刚才不是义愤别人不关怀那个老头吗？好！你自己关怀了，可又懊悔了。这像什么话！ \n　　但是，先买认的票是个很快需要确定的问题，顺为两个队伍后面都在继续增加排队票的人。如果不很快做出决定，说不定两头都要误了。 \n　　我来不及多想，很快站到了８０２次的队伍后面。 \n　　一刹那间，我感到自己很羞愧。但同时也试图找了一些理由来为自己的良心解脱。我想８０３次增加两趟车，而８０２次只增另一趟。这样看来，先买８０２次然后再买８０３次，更有希望两全其美。当然同时买两张票更好，但我又不会分身法！所以看来，事情这这样做是合乎逻辑的。另外，我想我着实努力，即使买不上８０３次的车票（谢天谢地不希望这样），我在户心上也能过得去：在这众多的人里面，我虽然没有能解决瞎眼老头的实际问题，但我是唯一关怀过他，并且用行动为他做了努力的人。
