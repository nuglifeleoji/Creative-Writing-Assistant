\n　　他赶紧上了炕，蹲在坐着的老祖母面前，准备把她从那一堆破烂被褥里扶起来。少平以为奶奶要上厕所，立刻示意他姐赶快把门外的便盆拿进来。这一下，兰花和她妈的注意力才转移到老人这一边来了，赶忙寻便盆，生怕老人把屎尿屙在炕上。 \n　　老太太现在仍然在为死去的少安哭啼，她一边哭，一边生气地用手势制止她们给她找便盆，并且对兰花母女先前不给她说明灾祸而现在又误解她的意思，在脸上表示出强烈的愤慨。她声音沙哑地哭喊着“我的安安呀……”，然后用一只手揪着少平的领口，让他尽量挨近她。 \n　　老太太哭着问少平：“把安安……枪打在……什么地方了？” \n　　“什么？”少平大声问，没听清奶奶说什么。 \n　　“安安的……尸首……拉回来了没？” \n　　“啊呀！我哥好好的嘛！谁给你说……”少平愁眉苦脸地笑了一下。 \n　　“她们说……枪打了……那么把谁……打死了？”“谁也没死！都活着哩！”少平大声说。 \n　　“那你姐……你姐……哭谁哩？”“是我姐夫！他……”少平一下不知怎样给焦急的老祖宗说清楚这事。 \n　　“你姐夫……怎啦？”老太太一下子不哭了。噢！使她宽慰的是，最亲的人没出事。对她来说，兰花的女婿虽然也重要，但终究没家里其他人重要。 \n　　少平仍然不知道怎样给奶奶说清他姐夫的事，就只好随口说：“他犯了点错误，人家让他劳教！” \n　　“猫……叫？”老太太不明白这是什么意思。 \n　　少平忍不住笑了。 \n　　少平他妈已经下了炕，对儿子说：“你就给奶奶说什么事也没。” \n　　“你和我姐哭，她看见了，能哄了吗？” \n　　这时候，老太太更急了，指着脚地上吃糖的猫蛋说：“是……猫蛋？她不是好好的吗？” \n　　“不是嘛，是我姐夫！”少平也急了。 \n　　老人看来非要打破沙锅问到底不可，她瘦手紧紧揪着少平的领口，追问道：“你姐夫……出什么事了？猫叫……是怎啦？” \n　　少平大声说：“不是猫叫，是劳教！就象学生娃调皮，叫先生训了一顿！”他急中生智，即兴想了个奶奶可以明白的解释。 \n　　“噢……”老人这才长出了一口气，瘦手把他的领口放开，疲倦地闭住了眼睛。她这下听明白了。唉，这算个屁事！还值得老老小小哭一场？旧社会，先生常拿铁戒尺把念书娃的手都打肿了，肿得象发面馍馍一样。训一\n######################\nOutput:",
