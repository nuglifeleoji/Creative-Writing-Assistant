数日之后，孔明与云长等正坐间，人报关平到，众官皆惊。关平入，呈上玄德书信。孔明视之，内言本年七月初七日，庞军师被张任在落凤坡前箭射身故。孔明大哭，众官无不垂泪。孔明曰：“既主公在涪关进退两难之际，亮不得不去。”云长曰：“军师去，谁人保守荆州？荆州乃重地，干系非轻。”孔明曰：“主公书中虽不明言其人，吾已知其意了。”乃将玄德书与众官看曰：“主公书中，把荆州托在吾身上，教我自量才委用。虽然如此，今教关平赍书前来，其意欲云长公当此重任。云长想桃园结义之情，可竭力保守此地，责任非轻，公宜勉之。”云长更不推辞，慨然领诺。孔明设宴，交割印绶。云长双手来接。孔明擎着印曰：“这干系都在将军身上。”云长曰：“大丈夫既领重任，除死方休。”孔明见云长说个“死”字，心中不悦；欲待不与，其言已出。孔明曰：“倘曹操引兵来到，当如之何？”云长曰：“以力拒之。”孔明又曰：“倘曹操、孙权，齐起兵来，如之奈何？”云长曰：“分兵拒之。”孔明曰：“若如此，荆州危矣。吾有八个字，将军牢记，可保守荆州。”云长问：“那八个字？”孔明曰：“北拒曹操，东和孙权。”云长曰：“军师之言，当铭肺腑。”\n\n    孔明遂与了印绶，令文官马良、伊籍、向朗、糜竺，武将糜芳、廖化、关平、周仓，一班儿辅佐云长，同守荆州。一面亲自统兵入川。先拨精兵一万，教张飞部领，取大路杀奔巴州、雒城之西，先到者为头功。又拨一枝兵，教赵云为先锋，溯江而上，会于雒城。孔明随后引简雍、蒋琬等起行。那蒋琬字公琰，零陵湘乡人也，乃荆襄名士，现为书记。\n\n    当日孔明引兵一万五千，与张飞同日起行。张飞临行时，孔明嘱付曰：“西川豪杰甚多，不可轻敌。于路戒约三军，勿得掳掠百姓，以失民心。所到之处，并宜存恤，勿得恣逞鞭挞士卒。望将军早会雒城，不可有误。”\n\n    张飞欣然领诺，上马而去。迤逦前行，所到之处，但降者秋毫无犯。径取汉川路，前至巴郡。细作回报：“巴郡太守严颜，乃蜀中名将，年纪虽高，精力未衰，善开硬弓，使大刀，有万夫不当之勇：据住城郭，不竖降旗。”张飞教离城十里下寨，差人入城去：“说与老匹�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
