\n　　生活如此叫人感慨万端！贫困时，这家人风雨同舟；日子稍有好转，便产生了矛盾，导致了分家的局面。而经过一次又一次生活风暴的冲刷，这个家又变得这样亲密无间了。是的，所有人的心情从来也没有象现在这样和顺和畅快！当然罗，老祖母基本上还生活在她的世界里。 \n　　祖母的视力是越来越不行了，几乎已处于失明状态。一身老病依然照旧，只不过看起来还没有恶化的迹象。尽管她骂儿孙们浪费，但她的衣服和被褥还是都换成了新的。吃喝更不用说，从去年开始，少安在金俊山那里为祖母每天订了一斤牛奶。当然，若要叫她到医院去看病，那是怎样都搬不动她老人家的。她拒绝吃药打针，理由还是怕费钱。贫穷已经成了她一生主要的恐怖。现在，她仍然围坐在炕上的被褥里，眨巴着一双几乎看不见什么的红眼，竭力还想弄明白家里发生的某些事，母亲和妻子都忙得要命。有时还不得不大声地费上半天口舌，解释她一再询问的许多“问题”。 \n　　当老人平静的时候，通常都是摸索着数一瓶止痛片——倒出来，又数着一粒粒装进去，我们不知是否还记得，这瓶止痛片是少平上高中时用润叶姐给他的钱买的。已经近十年了，尽管老祖母每次数时都有短缺或长余，但实际上这瓶已经象羊粪蛋一样又黑又脏的药片一粒也没少——我们的老祖母舍不得吃啊……正在孙少安忙里忙出的时候，他突然听说石圪节那个快要倒塌的乡办砖瓦厂，要承包给个人去经营了。 \n　　这消息不由使他心一动。他知道，石圪节的乡办砖场比他现在的砖场大几倍，设备和条件都不错，只是管理不行，根本赚不了多少钱。后来虽然内部实行承包制，看来也没有解决大问题，因此乡上才下决心干脆往出总承包呀！ \n　　他敢不敢去冒这个险呢？少安开始周密地考虑这件事的可能性。 \n　　他想，如果放开胆量把这个大型砖场承包了，往后的发展肯定要大得多！ \n　　说实话，随着现在这个砖场的盈利，他的野心也逐步大起来——他已很不满足这个小摊场，而早想谋算件更大的事。手头赚下的几万块钱，也使他的这种谋算有了一种踏实的心里保障。人就是这样，得一步，就想另一步！如果将来那个大砖厂盈了利，那说不定还能干更大一点的事！他有一种虽然朦胧、但却十分强烈的冲动：他一辈子真正要在石圪节或者说原西县闹腾它一番世事哩！ \n　　孙少安进而又想，如果他承包了乡上的砖厂，就把他现在这个砖场也�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>祖母<|>PERSON<|>The grandmother is an elderly woman who is nearly
