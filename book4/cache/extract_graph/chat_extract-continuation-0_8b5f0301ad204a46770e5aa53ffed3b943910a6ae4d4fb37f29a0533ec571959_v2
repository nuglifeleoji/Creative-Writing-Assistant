\n　　“走一走！”明明命令小黑说。 \n　　聪敏的小狗真的在脚地上走起来，那铃铛便发出怪中听的声响。 \n　　由于少平的到来，使这个刚才还不愉快的家庭很快充满了欢乐。 \n　　吃完饭后，惠英嫂赶着去矿灯房上班。少平就和明明以及小黑子，一块相跟着去矿小学。明明穿上他那套天蓝色带白杠的运动服，显得挺神气。小黑子吐着舌头，在他们前后乱跑。他们沿着铁路，通过洗煤楼，来到西边医院下面的小学大门口。 \n　　在校门口遇到了一点小小的麻烦：门房老头不让小黑子进去。 \n　　明明都快急哭了——他很想让小黑子也进去为他加油。 \n　　少平好说歹说，最后给那老头敬上一根纸烟，并且亲手划火柴为他点着，老头才为小黑子开了“后门”，让他进去了。今天这学校实在是热闹！孩子们穿上了漂亮的运动衣，都有母亲或父亲来为他们喊“加油”。矿工们对孩子的溺爱十分出格——他们艰苦生活中的许多安慰都是孩子带来的。如果是大城市的小学，此类活动大概不会有家长前去助兴。但对矿工们来说，孩子的这类活动似乎是生活中的一件大事，岂有不来为娃娃喊“加油”的道理！因此，有的人为了满足孩子的愿望，竟连班也不去上了，专门误一个下午来参加这个“运动会”。 \n　　有人认出了孙少平，奇怪地问：“你怎也来了？” \n　　少平只好如实说：“我是为王师傅的孩子来的。”这些人“噢！”一声，表示出一副“恍然大悟”的神色。少平不管这些，他知道，关于他和惠英之间的长长短短，早有人传播开了，煤矿说两性之间的事，就象说市场上的菜价一样，说者听者都不当一回事。 \n　　在小学大操场上，用白灰划出了许多道道和圈圈。比赛有各年级的跳绳、跑步以及孩子们的各类运动项目。 \n　　二年级的比赛项目是：女孩子跳绳，男孩子赛跑。明明参加的是五十米赛跑。 \n　　开始前，少平一再叮咛他：不要向两边看，只管往前跑！ \n　　当孩子们在起点上各就各位后，他们的家长也分别集中到了跑道两边，紧张得如同自己在参赛。少平带着小黑子也挤在人群中，准备为明明喊“加油”。 \n　　口令一下，孩子们就争先恐后跑开了。两边的大人们也在跑道外撵着娃娃们跑，并且嘴里叫着自己孩子的乳名或官名，给他们呐喊助阵，声音响彻了云霄。 \n　　少平和小黑子相跟着奔跑，嘴里不断喊�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
