长史杨仪有紧急表到。近臣拆表读曰：“长史、绥军将军臣杨仪，诚惶诚恐，顿首谨表：丞相临终，将大事委于臣，照依旧制，不敢变更，使魏延断后，姜维次之。今魏延不遵丞相遗语，自提本部人马，先入汉中，放火烧断栈道，劫丞相灵车，谋为不轨。变起仓卒，谨飞章奏闻。”太后听毕，问：“卿等所见若何？”蒋琬奏曰：“以臣愚见：杨仪为人虽禀性过急，不能容物，至于筹度粮草，参赞军机，与丞相办事多时，今丞相临终，委以大事，决非背反之人。魏延平日恃功务高，人皆下之；仪独不假借，延心怀恨；今见仪总兵，心中不服，故烧栈道，断其归路，又诬奏而图陷害。臣愿将全家良贱，保杨仪不反。实不敢保魏延。”董允亦奏曰：“魏延自恃功高，常有不平之心，口出怨言。向所以不即反者，惧丞相耳。今丞相新亡，乘机为乱，势所必然。若杨仪，才干敏达，为丞相所任用，必不背反。”后主曰：“若魏延果反，当用何策御之？”蒋琬曰：“丞相素疑此人，必有遗计授与杨仪。若仪无恃，安能退入谷口乎？延必中计矣。陛下宽心。”不多时，魏延又表至，告称杨仪背反。正览表之间，杨仪又表到，奏称魏延背反。二人接连具表，各陈是非。忽报费祎到。后主召入，祎细奏魏延反情。后主曰：“若如此，且令董允假节释劝，用好言抚慰。”允奉诏而去。\n\n    却说魏延烧断栈道，屯兵南谷，把住隘口，自以为得计；不想杨仪、姜维星夜引兵抄到南谷之后。仪恐汉中有失，令先锋何平引三千兵先行。仪同姜维等引兵扶柩望汉中而来。\n\n    且说何平引兵径到南谷之后，擂鼓呐喊。哨马飞报魏延，说杨仪令先锋何平引兵自槎山小路抄来搦战。延大怒，急披挂上马，提刀引兵来迎。两阵对圆，何平出马大骂曰：“反贼魏延安在？”延亦骂曰：“汝助杨仪造反，何敢骂我！”平叱曰：“丞相新亡，骨肉未寒，汝焉敢造反！”乃扬鞭指川兵曰：“汝等军士，皆是西川之人，川中多有父母妻子，兄弟亲朋；丞相在日，不曾薄待汝等，今不可助反贼，宜各回家乡，听候赏赐。”众军闻言，大喊一声，散去大半。延大怒，挥刀纵马，直取何平。平挺枪来迎。战不数合，平诈败而走，延随后赶来。众\n######################\nOutput:",
