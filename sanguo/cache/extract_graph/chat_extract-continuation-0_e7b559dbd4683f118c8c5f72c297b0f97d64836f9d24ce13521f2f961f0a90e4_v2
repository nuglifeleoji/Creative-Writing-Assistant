之。操大喜，问曰：“谁知吾意？”左右曰：“杨修也。”操虽称美，心甚忌之。又一日，塞北送酥一盒至。操自写“一合酥”三字于盒上，置之案头。修入见之，竟取匙与众分食讫。操问其故，修答曰：“盒上明书一人一口酥，岂敢违丞相之命乎？”操虽喜笑，而心恶之。操恐人暗中谋害己身，常分付左右：“吾梦中好杀人；凡吾睡着，汝等切勿近前。”一日，昼寝帐中，落被于地，一近侍慌取覆盖。操跃起拔剑斩之，复上床睡；半晌而起，佯惊问：“何人杀吾近侍？”众以实对。操痛哭，命厚葬之。人皆以为操果梦中杀人；惟修知其意，临葬时指而叹曰：“丞相非在梦中，君乃在梦中耳！”操闻而愈恶之。操第三子曹植，爱修之才，常邀修谈论，终夜不息。操与众商议，欲立植为世子，曹丕知之，密请朝歌长吴质入内府商议；因恐有人知觉，乃用大簏藏吴质于中，只说是绢匹在内，载入府中。修知其事，径来告操。操令人于丕府门伺察之。丕慌告吴质，质曰：“无忧也：明日用大簏装绢再入以惑之。”丕如其言，以大簏载绢入。使者搜看簏中，果绢也，回报曹操。操因疑修谮害曹丕，愈恶之。操欲试曹丕、曹植之才干。一日，令各出邺城门；却密使人分付门吏，令勿放出。曹丕先至，门吏阻之，丕只得退回。植闻之，问于修。修曰：“君奉王命而出，如有阻当者，竟斩之可也。”植然其言。及至门，门吏阻住。植叱曰：“吾奉王命，谁敢阻当！”立斩之。于是曹操以植为能。后有人告操曰：“此乃杨修之所教也。”操大怒，因此亦不喜植。修又尝为曹植作答教十余条，但操有问，植即依条答之。操每以军国之事问植，植对答如流。操心中甚疑。后曹丕暗买植左右，偷答教来告操。操见了大怒曰：“匹夫安敢欺我耶！”此时已有杀修之心；今乃借惑乱军心之罪杀之。修死年三十四岁。后人有诗曰：“聪明杨德祖，世代继簪缨。丫丫电子书龙蛇走，胸中锦绣成。开谈惊四座，捷对冠群英。身死因才误，非关欲退兵。”\n\n
