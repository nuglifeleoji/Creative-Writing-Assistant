“没有人犯案后在做完善后处理前睡觉的，而且就算真的因此没时间睡觉，也不会请假，照理说就算勉强硬撑也会去上班。”\n    “……大概是有什么理由让他非请假不可吧。”\n    “我就是在想那个理由。”汤川拿起马克杯。\n    草S把桌上的出勤表仔细折好。\n    “今天我有件事非问你不可，那就是你开始怀疑石神的起因。如果你不告诉我，我也不好办事。”\n    “这话太奇怪了。你不是靠自己的力量，查出他对花冈靖子有好感了吗？那个关于这点，你应该不用再问我意见了。”\n    “问题是事情没这么简单，我也有我的立场。我向上司报告时，总不能说我只是随便碰运气才盯上石神吧？”\n    “就说你查清花冈靖子的周旁关系后，石神这个数学老师浮上台面――这样不就够了吗？”\n    “我是这样报告了，而且还查过石神和花冈靖子的关系。可惜到目前为止，完全找不出任何证据足以证明两人之间有密切关系。”\n   汤川听了连马克杯也没放下，就晃着身体笑了起来。\n    “哈哈，我想也是。”\n    “什么？你这是什么意思。”\n    “没什么特别意思，我只是说他们之间想必毫无瓜葛。我敢断言，你们就算再怎么查也查不出东西。”\n    “你别说这种事不关己的风凉话。像我们组长，已经快对石神失去兴趣了。再这样下去，我就算想自行查证都会有困难。所以我才想请你\n\n告诉我，你为何盯上石神。喂，你就说啊，你为什么不肯告诉我？”\n    大概是因为草S语带恳求，汤川恢复正经的表情，放下马克杯。\n    “因为说了也毫无意义，对你来说也帮不上任何忙。”\n    “为什么？”\n    “促使我开始怀疑他和本案有关的起因，就和你从刚才反复提及的一样。我是从某个小地方，察觉他对花冈靖子的好感，所以我才会起意\n\n调查他涉案的可能性。我知道你一定会问，单凭他疑似暗怀好感为何就能这么推论，但这是所谓的直觉吧。除非是对他有种程度的认识否则很\n\n难理解，你不也常常提到刑警的直觉吗？就和那个一样。”\n    “这一点也不像平时的你会说的话，你居然会说出直觉这种字眼。”\n    “偶一为之应该无妨吧。”\n    “那么至少请你告诉我，你是怎么察觉石神对靖子有好感的。”\n    “办不到。”\n    “喂……”\n    “因为这牵涉到他的自尊，我不想告诉别人。”\n    正当草S叹息之际，敲门声响起，一名学生走了进来。\n    “喔。”汤川招呼那个学生，“突然找你来不好意思，我想跟你谈谈前几天那份报告。”\n
