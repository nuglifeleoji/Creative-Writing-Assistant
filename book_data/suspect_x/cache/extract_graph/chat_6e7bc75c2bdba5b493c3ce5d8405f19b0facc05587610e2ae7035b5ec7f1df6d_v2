Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.”\n“And now we control it?”\n“To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product—the spice.\nImagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production.”\n“Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,” Paul said. “Others would be out in the cold.” The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim\nsatisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been. He nodded. “The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.”\n“They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.”\n“They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,” the Duke said. “Think of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership—their unofficial sookesman. Think how they’d react if | were responsible for a serious reduction in their income. After all, one’s own profits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can’t let someone pauperize you!” A harsh smile twisted the Duke’s mouth. “They’d look the other way no matter what was done to me.”\n“Even if we were attacked with atomics?” “Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost anything else short of that...\nperhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning.”\n“Then why are we walking into this?”\n“Paul!” The Duke frowned at his son. “Knowing where the trap is—that’s the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale —a feint within a feint within a feint...seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask another\nquestion: Who else is stockpiling? That’s the list of our enemies.”\n“Who?”\n“Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we'd thought friendly. We need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more important: our beloved Padishah Emperor.”\nPaul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. “Couldn’t you convene the Landsraad, expose—”\n“Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul—we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If we put this before the Landsraad it’d only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we’d gain is a little time while risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?”\n“All the Houses might start stockpiling spice.”\n“Our enemies have a head start—too much of a lead to overcome.”\n“The Emperor,” Paul said. “That means the Sardaukar.”\n“Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,” the Duke said. “But the soldier fanatics nonetheless.”\n“How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?”\n“Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?”\n“The Emperor’s prison planet? No.”\n“What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There’s a question you never hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come from?”\n“From the prison planet?”\n“They come from somewhere.”\n“But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from—”\n“That’s what we're led to believe: they're just the Emperor’s levies trained young and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor’s training cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the military forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and their supporting levies on the other. And their Supporting levies, Paul. The Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar.”\n“But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!”\n“Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men, what environmental conditions would you impose on them?”\n“How could you win the loyalty of such men?”\n“There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority, the mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done. It has been done on many worlds in many times.”\nPaul nodded, holding his attention on his father’s face. He felt some revelation impending.\n“Consider Arrakis,” the Duke said. “When you get outside the towns and garrison villages, it’s every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus.”\nPaul’s eyes went wide. “The Fremen!”\n“We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the Sardaukar. It'll require patience to\nexploit them secretly and wealth to equip them properly. But the Fremen are there...and the spice wealth is there. You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.”\n“Don’t the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?”\n“The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even bothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary populations—spend as little as possible to maintain them.”\nThe metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father’s breast glistened as the Duke shifted his position. “You see?”\n“We're negotiating with the Fremen right now,” Paul said.\n“I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,” the Duke said. “A proud and ruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. | think the Fremen will admire him. If we're lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.”\n“Duncan, the moral,” Paul said, “and Gurney the valorous.”\n“You name them well,” the Duke said.\nAnd Paul thought: Gurney’s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a supporter of worlds—”“... the valor of the brave.”\n“Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,” the Duke said.\n“That isn’t what he told me.”\nThe Duke laughed aloud. “I figured Gurney to be Sparse with his praise. He says you have a nicety of\nawareness—in his own words—of the difference between a blade’s edge and its tip.”\n“Gurney says there’s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be done with the edge.”\n“Gurney’s a romantic,” the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly disturbed him, coming from his son. “I’d sooner you never had to kill...but if the need arises, you do it however you can—tip or edge.” He looked up at the skylight, on which the rain was drumming.\nSeeing the direction of his father’s stare, Paul thought of the wet skies out there—a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts—and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. “Are the Guild ships really big?” he asked.\nThe Duke looked at him. “This wi// be your first time off planet,” he said. “Yes, they’re big. We'll be riding a Heighliner because it’s a long trip. A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner—we'll be just a Small part of the ship’s manifest.”\n“And we won't be able to leave our frigates?”\n“That’s part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we’d have nothing to fear from them. The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.”\n“I’m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.”\n“You won’t. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild’s as jealous of its privacy as it\nis of its monopoly. Don’t do anything to endanger our Shipping privileges, Paul.”\n“Do you think they hide because they’ve mutated and don’t look...Auman anymore?”\n“Who knows?” The Duke shrugged. “It’s a mystery we're not likely to solve. We’ve more immediate problems—among them: you.”\n“Me?”\n“Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have Mentat capabilities.”\nPaul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: “A Mentat? Me? But l....”\n“Hawat agrees, Son. It’s true.”\n“But | thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldn’t be told because it might inhibit the early....” He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. “I see,” he said.\n“A day comes,” the Duke said, “when the potential Mentat must learn what’s being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about himself.”\nPaul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother—the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices—all of it clicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind.\n“You'll be the Duke someday, Son,” his father said. “A Mentat Duke would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now...or do you need more time?”\nThere was no hesitation in his answer. “lIl go on with the training.”\n“Formidable indeed,” the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his father’s face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke’s narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he thought.\nBut even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica’s latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n—FROM “ANALYSIS: THE ARRAKEEN CRISIS” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN (PRIVATE CIRCULATION: B.G.
