It is also the site of critical meetings, discussions, and inspections, where Odrade scrutinizes operations for signs of inefficiency or complacency. The urban area includes \"The Way,\" a major thoroughfare, and supports plantations and orchards vital for morale and sustenance.  \n\nAdditionally, CENTRAL serves as a logistical and ceremonial center, hosting burials and other Bene Gesserit rituals near the ship.
