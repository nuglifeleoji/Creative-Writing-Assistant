\n　　李登云走后，这一家四口人又开始逐个向徐国强敬酒。晓霞对外公开玩笑说：“老年人和娃娃一样，可看重过生日了！年轻人常记不起给自己过生日！” \n　　徐国强笑了，疼爱地看着他这个风风火火的外孙女，说：“娃娃过生日是盼长大哩！老年人过一个生日，就向坟墓走近一步……” \n　　爱云瞪了一眼女儿。晓霞侧过脸给姐姐吐了一下舌头。润叶很快站起来，给徐大爷斟了一杯酒，说：“爷爷，我敬你一杯酒，祝你长命百岁！” \n　　徐国强高兴地端起酒杯，对大家说：“咱们最后一块喝一盅吧！祝大家都平安康泰！” \n　　于是，一家人就又都高高兴兴站起来，喝了这最后一杯酒…… \n　　酒宴完了以后，润叶就对家里人说，她学校有事，要赶快返回去。 \n　　她心事重重地离开二妈家，出了县革委会的大门，向学校走去。 \n　　在去学校的路上，她还是想着少安为什么没到城里来。这现在又过了中午，看来他今天也不一定来了。唉……她一路走，一路苦闷地踢着一颗小石子，直把这颗小石子一脚又一脚从县革委会踢到小学的门口。 \n　　她进了学校大门，猛地呆住了！ \n　　她看见：少安正在她宿舍的门口低着头转来转去——啊，亲爱的人，你终于来了！
