A native of **Gammu** and a seasoned soldier, Patrin is deeply involved in Teg's affairs, from managing training schedules—including that of **Duncan Idaho**—to overseeing operations at the **South Farm**. Despite his tactical expertise and leadership capabilities, he chooses to remain a squad leader, refusing formal rank despite being entitled to the pay and courtesies of a **colonel-aide**.  \n\nPatrin is instrumental in the defense against threats such as the **Face Dancers** and the **Tleilaxu**, meticulously following Teg's orders and contributing to escape plans. His most notable act of loyalty is his **self-sacrifice**—he detonates a decoy ship to mislead pursuers, ensuring the safety of Teg and his allies during the attack on the **Keep**. This act underscores his unwavering dedication.  \n\nEarlier in his life, Patrin discovered the **no-globe complex**, a hidden sanctuary on Gammu, which he kept secret. His relationship with Teg spans decades, symbolizing both Teg’s past and Duncan Idaho’s potential. Patrin also interacts directly with Duncan, conveying orders and assisting in his training. Described as a **fragile link**—a concept Teg trained him to recognize—Patrin’s death marks the end of a crucial but vulnerable connection in Teg’s network.  \n\nIn retirement, Patrin continues to serve Teg as a steadfast companion, embodying loyalty, tactical acumen, and self-sacrifice.
