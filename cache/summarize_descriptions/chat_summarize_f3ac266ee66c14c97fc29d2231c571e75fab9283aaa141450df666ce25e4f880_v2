This description underscores the sled's practical role in facilitating movement in extreme conditions, allowing the narrator to traverse the icy landscape effectively. It highlights the sled's importance not only as a tool for travel but also as a symbol of resilience and adaptability in the face of nature's challenges.\n\nMoreover, the sled takes on a darker connotation in the context of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein,\" where it serves as the place where the body of Frankenstein's creature is laid.
