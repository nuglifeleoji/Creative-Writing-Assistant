\n　　不管怎样，大年重新奋发起来。他首先从他考得最糟的英语开始复习。他不愿意呆在家里埋头学习，以免不了解内情的人把他看成个二流子，知道内情的人又乘机笑话他。他有他的自尊心。 \n　　但是这种学习是极其艰难的。每当他背着一捆庄稼从山上下来时，汗水腌疼的眼睛已经分辨不清他栽在路边小石片上的那些英语单词了。但他仍然拚命完成每天的学习计划。日月流逝，他变得像一个苦行僧一般，经常累得眼睛迷迷糊糊，走路摇摇晃晃，头总是有敢无力地耷拉着。但是，他觉得自己的的精神却从来也没像现在这样高扬过，看吧，他走路念念有词，他上厕所念念有词，他在煤油灯前伏案演算，常常因打盹把头发烧着，满头一片焦黄……所有这一切，他都忍受着。有时，痛苦的浪潮猛然又袭上心头，折磨得他死去活来。每当这时，他就在心里默念着那句话：“当我再见到你的时候……” \n　　此刻，痛苦也正的折磨着另一个人。这不是别人，正是小丽她妈。 \n　　冬去春来，冰雪消融，土地解冻，大地又孕育着一种勃然生机。可是这季节，对一关节炎病人却不是好兆头。 \n　　小丽她妈每到这时，腿关节就疼得像钢针扎着一般。今年开春尤其严重。寡妇算不上幸福，也算不上不幸。丈夫虽说过世太早，她亲爱的女儿却考上大学。回忆往事辛酸不少，瞻望未来倒也甜甜的：再熬上几年，等小丽大学一毕业，她就好跟上女儿享福去罗！ \n　　但是，眼前的日子的确不好过。身边没有一个亲人，而土地都分到了户，庄稼谁给她种呀？过不久就要耕地，她不知又该求村时机哪一家。要是往年，她不熬煎，有高仁山一家人哩。如今还有什么脸面去求他！ \n　　这一天，她到沟底的水井去提水。返回时，该死的腿走到半坡上，疼得怎么也走不动了。她把水罐放到路边，双手抱住膝盖，嘴一张一张的，就差没放开声哭了！ \n　　偏巧这时高仁山父子三人正从后山沟里回来，在河那面的小路上往自己家里走。他们三人都看见了河这边的情景。大年他哥显然幸灾乐祸了，瞧他嘴一撇，照旧往回去，大年看了看父亲，父亲低倾着头也只顾走路，装作没看见什么的样子。 \n　　大年站住了。他望着前面走去的父亲和哥哥，心里很不是滋味。父�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
