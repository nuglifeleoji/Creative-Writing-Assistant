He is the son of a deceased planetologist and inherits his father's deep understanding of Arrakis' ecology, including its sandworms, spice, and harsh desert environment. Kynes wears a stillsuit, carries concealed items, and is deeply integrated into Fremen culture, even marrying into their community.  \n\nAs the **Judge of the Change**, Kynes holds arbiter authority from the Imperium, mediating disputes and overseeing transitions of power. He plays a pivotal role in aiding **Paul Atreides** and **Lady Jessica** during their escape from Harkonnen forces, promising Fremen assistance and guiding them through the dangers of Arrakis. His knowledge of hidden bases and desert survival proves crucial to their survival.  \n\nKynes is deeply involved in **terraforming efforts**, training Fremen in ecological methods and discovering the salt pan as part of his long-term vision to transform Arrakis. Despite his Imperial role, he is fiercely loyal to the Fremen, earning their respect and deference. His dual allegiances sometimes place him in conflict with powerful figures like **Baron Harkonnen**, who suspects him of treachery and orders his death.  \n\nStranded in the desert at one point, Kynes hallucinates conversations with his deceased father, reflecting his profound connection to both his heritage and the planet. He exhibits Fremen qualities, including a casual attitude toward violence when necessary, yet maintains a cautious and insightful demeanor in political dealings.  \n\nKynes is a **commanding presence** among the Fremen, admired for his expertise on wormsign and spice operations. His legacy as both a scientist and a revolutionary figure cements his importance in the ecological and political future of Arrakis.\",27\r\n129,GUILD BANK,\"The **Guild Bank** is a powerful financial institution closely associated with the **Spacing Guild**, operating with significant influence on **Arrakis** and deeply involved in the planet's economic affairs. It serves as a key financial entity, providing support to political factions such as the **Duke** in his actions against the **Harkonnens**. However, its representatives are known to maintain complex and sometimes concealed allegiances, suggesting that the Guild Bank's motivations may not always align transparently with its stated alliances.  \n\nWhile the institution plays a critical role in financing and economic strategy, its true loyalties remain ambiguous, as its representatives may act with hidden agendas. This duality positions the Guild Bank as both a financial pillar for its allies and a potentially unpredictable force in the political landscape of **Arrakis**. Its involvement in the conflict between the **Duke** and the **Harkonnens** underscores its strategic importance, though its ultimate objectives may extend beyond mere financial transactions.  \n\nIn summary, the **Guild Bank** is a formidable economic power with deep ties to the **Spacing Guild**, wielding influence over **Arrakis** while navigating shifting political alliances and undisclosed interests. Its role as both a supporter and an enigmatic player makes it a pivotal yet unpredictable entity in the region's power dynamics.\",2\r\n203,KYNES' FATHER,\"Kynes' father was a planetologist who worked on Arrakis before his death.

Additionally, it is noted that Kynes' father also perished in a similar cave-in at the same location. While the descriptions slightly differ in specifying which Kynes died there—either Kynes-the-Umma or Kynes' father—the overarching narrative confirms that the Plaster Basin is a place of historical and personal tragedy for the Kynes lineage.

This expertise also places Kynes in a position of strategic importance, as seen in their role in blocking escape routes for House Atreides during conflicts on the planet.  \n\nDespite their profound connection to Arrakis, Kynes ultimately dies on the planet, underscoring their inextricable bond with its environment.

However, there is some ambiguity regarding whether it was Kynes themselves or Kynes' father who perished in the incident. The most coherent interpretation, given the available information, is that Kynes was the one who died in the cave-in at Plaster Basin, as this is the more directly stated claim. The mention of Kynes' father may imply a familial connection to the event, possibly suggesting a shared history with the site, but the primary account focuses on Kynes' death.  \n\nPlaster Basin is thus remembered as the site of this fatal accident, though further details about the circumstances or the significance of the location remain unspecified.
