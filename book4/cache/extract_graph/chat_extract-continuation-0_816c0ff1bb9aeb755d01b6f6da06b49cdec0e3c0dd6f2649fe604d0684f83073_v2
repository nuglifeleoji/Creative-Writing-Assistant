\n　　十天之后，第一批砖窑开始点火。 \n　　滚滚的黑烟凶猛地冲天而起，再一次笼罩了南面的天空。双水村人不得不又一次把目光移到了这里。 \n　　孙少安和他的砖场，重新成了全村人议论的话题！ \n　　当然，那些说风凉话的人还在继续说着。不过，他们一边说着，一边不安地瞧着南头那一片翻滚不息的黑烟。至于那些少安还欠着工钱的村民，都眼巴巴地盼望他起码能烧成几窑好砖，把他们的工钱开了——这点钱对他们是那么重要！孙少安和贺秀莲兴奋地忙碌着。 \n　　秀莲的肚子已经大起来，但仍然门里门外不停地操持；既做好多人的饭，还要到砖场去忙丈夫忙不过来的事，即是帮不上手，她也要转着为丈夫发现漏洞，以防再出现什么意外的闪失。但是，第一批砖还没烧成的时候，他们便又面临着一场严重的危机——当然，这倒不是砖又烧坏了。 \n　　这一天，原北县为少安贷款的胡永合的朋友，突然赶到了他门上，让少安立刻还那三千块贷款！ \n　　原来，少安刚离开原北，当地就有人把永合的朋友告下了，说他贷的三千块钱是给外县人的。这个县农业银行的领导大为恼火！如今钱这么缺，本县贷款都很困难，怎么能让外县人把钱贷走呢？他命令下面的人立刻把这笔贷款追回来。胡永合的朋友和孙少安并不认识。他不会把这笔钱替他还了，因此便赶到他家，让他马上想办法，声称绝对不能赶过五天！ \n　　天呀！这不是要他的命吗？这么短的时间，他到哪里去筹借这三千元呢？他正因为借一年钱借不下，才到外县贷这款呢！ \n　　孙少安急得快要发疯了。妻子一边用好吃好喝款待那位讨债的外县人，一边安慰丈夫说：“甭急躁，咱想办法。要不，让我再回一次柳林，让我爸和姐夫打掇着为咱借……”“上次借人家的钱还没还哩！”少安头搭拉在胸前，丧气地蹲在脚地上用手抠鞋帮子。 \n　　“要不，你再到县上跑跑，找他周县长去！”秀莲又出主意说。 \n　　孙少安觉得，妻子这主意倒有点门道。也许他只能找周县长解决他的困难。上次周县长不在县里，他希望这次起码能见到他。 \n　　亲爱的秀莲腆着大肚子，把他送上了去原西的公共汽车。临上车前，她一再给他宽心说：“你放心走你的。砖场的事和\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
