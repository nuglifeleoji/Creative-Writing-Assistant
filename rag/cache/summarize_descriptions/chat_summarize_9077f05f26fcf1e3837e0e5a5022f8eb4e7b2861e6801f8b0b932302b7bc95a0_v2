The Bene Gesserit, a powerful sisterhood with deep political and religious influence, often scrutinizes Ixian technology, noting its perceived decline in some instances. Despite this skepticism, they rely on Ix for advanced technological products, including crucial innovations like no-ships, which play a vital role in their operations.  \n\nThe Bene Gesserit maintain detailed archives assessing Ixian technology, reflecting their cautious yet pragmatic approach to its use. While they depend on Ix for certain advancements, tensions arise from their ideological differences, particularly regarding the role of technology in society. The Bene Gesserit prioritize human potential and spiritual discipline, whereas Ix champions technological progress as a cornerstone of civilization. This fundamental divide leads to periodic clashes over dominance in both technological and ideological spheres.  \n\nDespite these conflicts, the relationship remains transactional, with the Bene Gesserit leveraging Ixian innovations when necessary while remaining wary of their long-term implications.
