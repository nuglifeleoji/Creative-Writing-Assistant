What additional powers had been bred into this ghola by the sly Tleilaxu?\nAt their second nightfall in the wilderness, Lucilla was full of accusations. “Taraza ordered you to restore his original memories! How can you do that out here?”\n“When we reach sanctuary.”\nA silent and acutely alert Duncan accompanied them that night. There was a new vitality in him. He had heard!\nNothing must harm Teg, Duncan thought. Wherever and whatever sanctuary might be, Teg must reach it safely. Then, | will know!\nDuncan was not sure what he would know but now he fully accepted the prize in it. This wilderness must lead to that goal. He recalled staring out at the wild places from the Keep and how he had thought to be free here. That sense of untouched freedom had vanished. The wilderness was only a path to something more important.\nLucilla, bringing up the rear of this march, forced herself to remain calm, alert, and to accept what she could not change. Part of her awareness held firmly to Taraza’s orders:\n“Stay close to the ghola and, when the moment comes, complete your assignment.”\nOne pace at a time, Teg’s body measured out the kilometers. This was the fourth night. Patrin had estimated four nights to reach their goal.\nAnd what a goal!\nThe emergency escape plan centered on a discovery Patrin had made here as a teenager of one of Gammu’s many mysteries. Patrin’s words came back to Teg: “On the excuse of a personal reconnaissance, | returned to the place\ntwo days ago. It is untouched. | am still the only person who has ever been there.”\n“How can you be sure?”\n“I took my own precautions when | left Gammu years ago, little things that would be disturbed by another person. Nothing has been moved.”\n“A Harkonnen no-globe?”\n“Very ancient but the chambers are still intact and functioning.”\n“What about food, water...”\n“Everything you could want or need is there, laid down in the nullentropy bins at the core.”\nTeg and Patrin made their plans, hoping they would never have to use this emergency bolt hole, holding the secret of it close while Patrin replayed for Teg the hidden way to this childhood discovery.\nBehind Teg, Lucilla let out a small gasp as she tripped over a root.\nI should have warned her, Teg thought. Duncan obviously was following Teg’s lead by sound. Lucilla, just as obviously, had much of her attention on her own private thoughts.\nHer facial resemblance to Darwi Odrade was remarkable, Teg told himself. Back there at the Keep, the two women side by side, he had marked the differences dictated by their differing ages. Lucilla’s youth showed itself in more subcutaneous fat, a rounding of the facial flesh. But the voices! Timbre, accent, tricks of atonal inflection, the common stamp of Bene Gesserit speech mannerisms. They would be almost impossible to tell apart in the dark.\nKnowing the Bene Gesserit as he did, Teg knew this was no accident. Given the Sisterhood’s propensity for doubling and redoubling its prized genetic lines to protect the investment, there had to be a common ancestral source.\nAtreides, all of us, he thought.\nTaraza had not revealed her design for the ghola, but just being within that design gave Teg access to the growing\nshape of it. No complete pattern, but he could already sense a wholeness there.\nGeneration after generation, the Sisterhood dealing with the Tleilaxu, buying Idaho gholas, training them here on Gammu, only to have them assassinated. All of that time waiting for the right moment. It was like a terrible game, which had come into frenetic prominence because a girl capable of commanding the worms had appeared on Rakis.\nGammu itself had to be part of the design. Caladanian marks all over the place. Danian subtleties piled atop the more brutal ancient ways. Something other than population had come out of the Danian Sanctuary where the Tyrant’s grandmother, the Lady Jessica, had lived out her days.\nTeg had seen the overt and covert marks when he made his first reconnaissance tour of Gammu.\nWealth!\nThe signs were here to be read. It flowed around their universe, moving amoebalike to insinuate itself into any place where it could lodge. There was wealth from the Scattering on Gammu, Teg knew. Wealth so great that few suspected (or could imagine) its size and power.\nHe stopped walking abruptly. Physical patterns in the immediate landscape demanded his full attention. Ahead of them lay an exposed ledge of barren rock, its identifying markers planted in his memory by Patrin. This passage would be one of the more dangerous.\n“No caves or heavy growth to conceal you. Have the blanket ready.”\nTeg removed the life-shield from his pack and carried it over his arm. Once more he indicated that they should continue. The dark weave of the shield fabric hissed against his body as he moved.\nLucilla was becoming less of a cipher, he thought. She aspired to a Lady in front of her name. The Lady Lucilla. No doubt that had a pleasing sound to her. A few such titled Reverend Mothers were appearing now that Major Houses\nwere emerging from the long obscurity imposed by the Tyrant’s Golden Path.\nLucilla, the Seductress-Imprinter.\nAll such women of the Sisterhood were sexual adepts. Teg’s own mother had educated him in the workings of that system, sending him to well-selected local women when he was quite young, sensitizing him to the signs he must observe within himself as well as in the women. It was a forbidden training outside of Chapter House surveillance, but Teg’s mother had been one of the Sisterhood’s heretics.\n“You will have a need for this, Miles.”\nNo doubt there had been some prescience in her. She had armed him against the Imprinters who were trained in orgasmic amplification to fix the unconscious ties—male to female.\nLucilla and Duncan. An imprint on her would be an imprint on Odrade.\nTeg almost heard the pieces go snick as they locked together in his mind. Then what of the young woman on Rakis? Would Lucilla teach the techniques of seduction to her imprinted pupil, arm him to ensnare the one who commanded worms?\nNot enough data yet for a Prime Computation.\nTeg paused at the end of the dangerous open rock passage. He put away the blanket and sealed his pack while Duncan and Lucilla waited close behind. Teg heaved a sigh. The blanket always worried him. It did not have the deflective powers of a full battle shield but if a lasgun’s beam hit the thing the consequent quick-fire could be fatal.\nDangerous toys!\nThis was how Teg always classified such weapons and mechanical devices. Better to rely on your wits, your own flesh, and the Five Attitudes of the Bene Gesserit Way as his mother had taught him.\nUse the instruments only when they are absolutely required to amplify the flesh: that was the Bene Gesserit\nteaching.\n“Why are we stopping?” Lucilla whispered.\n“lam listening to the night,” Teg said.\nDuncan, his face a ghostly blur in the tree-filtered Starlight, stared at Teg. Teg’s features reassured him. They were lodged somewhere in an unavailable memory, Duncan thought. / can trust this man.\nLucilla suspected that they were stopping here because Teg’s old body demanded respite but she could not bring herself to say this. Teg said his escape plan included a way of getting Duncan to Rakis. Very well. That was all that mattered for the moment.\nShe already had figured out that this sanctuary somewhere ahead of them must involve a no-ship or a no- chamber. Nothing else would suffice. Somehow, Patrin had been the key to it. Teg’s few hints had revealed that Patrin was the source of their escape route.\nLucilla had been the first to realize how Patrin would have to pay for their escape. Patrin was the weakest link. He remained behind where Schwangyu could capture him. Capture of the decoy was inevitable. Only a fool would Suppose that a Reverend Mother of Schwangyu’s powers would be incapable of wresting secrets from a mere male. Schwangyu would not even require the heavy persuasion. The subtleties of Voice and those painful forms of interrogation that remained a Sisterhood monopoly—the agony box and nerve-node pressures—those were all she would require.\nThe form Patrin’s loyalty would take had been clear to Lucilla then. How could Teg have been so blind?\nLove!\nThat long, trusting bond between the two men. Schwangyu would act swiftly and brutally. Patrin knew it. Teg had not examined his own certain knowledge.\nDuncan’s voice shocked her from these thoughts.\n“\"Thopter! Behind us!”\n“Quick!” Teg whipped the blanket from his pack and threw it over them. They huddled in earth-smelling darkness, listening to the ornithopter pass above them. It did not pause or return.\nWhen they felt certain they had not been detected, Teg once more led them up Patrin’s memory-track.\n“That was a searcher,” Lucilla said. “They are beginning to suspect... or Patrin...”\n“Save your energy for walking,” Teg snapped.\nShe did not press him. They both knew Patrin was dead. Argument over this had been exhausted.\nThis Mentat goes deep, Lucilla told herself.\nTeg was the child of a Reverend Mother and that mother had trained him beyond the permitted limits before the Sisterhood took him into their manipulative hands. The ghola was not the only one here with unknown resources.\nTheir trail turned back and forth upon itself, a game track climbing a steep hill through thick forest. Starlight did not penetrate the trees. Only the Mentat’s marvelous memory kept them on the path.\nLucilla felt duff underfoot. She listened to Teg’s movements, reading them to guide her feet.\nHow silent Duncan is, she thought. How closed in upon himself. He obeyed orders. He followed where Teg led them. She sensed the quality of Duncan’s obedience. He kept his own counsel. Duncan obeyed because it suited him to do so —for now. Schwangyu’s rebellion had planted something wildly independent in the ghola. And what things of their own had the Tleilaxu planted in him?\nTeg stopped at a level spot beneath tall trees to regain his wind. Lucilla could hear him breathing deeply. This reminded her once more that the Mentat was a very old man, far too old for these exertions. She spoke quietly:\n“Are you all right, Miles?”\n“PI tell you when I’m not.”\n“How much farther?” Duncan asked.\n“Only a short way now.”\nPresently, he resumed his course through the night. “We must hurry,” he said. “This saddle-back ridge is the last bit.”\nNow that he had accepted the fact of Patrin’s death, Teg’s thoughts swung like a compass needle to Schwangyu and what she must be experiencing. Schwangyu would feel her world falling in around her. The fugitives had been gone four nights! People who could elude a Reverend Mother this way might do anything! Of course, the fugitives probably were off-planet by now. A no-ship. But what if...\nSchwangyu’s thoughts would be full of what-ifs.\nPatrin had been the fragile link but Patrin had been well trained in the removal of fragile links, trained by a master— Miles Teg.\nTeg dashed dampness from his eyes with a quick shake of his head. Immediate necessity required that core of internal honesty which he could not avoid. Teg had never\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and sexual adept, tasked with staying close to the ghola Duncan and completing her assignment when the moment comes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan is a ghola bred by the Tleilaxu, with restored memories and unknown resources, being escorted to sanctuary by Teg and Lucilla)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is a Mentat and Bashar, trained by a Bene Gesserit mother, leading the group to a hidden sanctuary on Gammu)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is a Bene Gesserit leader who ordered Lucilla to restore Duncan's original memories and complete her assignment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Patrin is Teg's loyal companion who discovered the hidden sanctuary on Gammu and sacrificed himself to ensure the group's escape)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Schwangyu is a Reverend Mother opposing Taraza's plans, who captured and likely killed Patrin to extract information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Darwi Odrade is a Bene Gesserit with a striking resemblance to Lucilla, possibly sharing a common ancestral source)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>The Lady Jessica is the Tyrant's grandmother, who lived out her days in the Danian Sanctuary and influenced Gammu's culture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is the planet where the group is escaping, with Caladanian and Danian influences, and a hidden Harkonnen no-globe sanctuary)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is the planet where a girl capable of commanding worms has appeared, possibly a key part of Taraza's design)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIAN SANCTUARY<|>GEO<|>The Danian Sanctuary is where the Lady Jessica lived, influencing Gammu's culture and wealth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location in Tiruzia where hostages were held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful Sisterhood with genetic breeding programs, political influence, and secret agendas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive group known for creating gholas and manipulating genetics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNEN NO-GLOBE<|>EVENT<|>The Harkonnen no-globe is an ancient, hidden sanctuary on Gammu, discovered by Patrin and used as an emergency escape route)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>DUNCAN<|>Lucilla is tasked with staying close to Duncan and completing her assignment, possibly imprinting him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>DUNCAN<|>Teg is protecting and guiding Duncan to sanctuary, as part of Taraza's design<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>PATRIN<|>Teg and Patrin shared a long, trusting bond, with Patrin sacrificing himself for Teg's escape<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>LUCILA<|>Taraza ordered Lucilla to restore Duncan's memories and complete her assignment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PATRIN<|>Schwangyu captured and likely killed Patrin to extract information about the escape plan<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>TLEILAXU<|>Duncan is a ghola bred by the Tleilaxu, with unknown modifications<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg was trained by a Bene Gesserit mother and is part of their plans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>Lucilla and Darwi Odrade share a striking resemblance and possibly a common ancestral source<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAMMU<|>HARKONNEN NO-GLOBE<|>Gammu contains the hidden Harkonnen no-globe sanctuary<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GAMMU<|>Teg is leading the group to a hidden sanctuary on Gammu<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>RAKIS<|>Duncan may be part of a plan involving the girl who commands worms on Rakis<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>DANIAN SANCTUARY<|>The Lady Jessica lived out her days in the Danian Sanctuary<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
