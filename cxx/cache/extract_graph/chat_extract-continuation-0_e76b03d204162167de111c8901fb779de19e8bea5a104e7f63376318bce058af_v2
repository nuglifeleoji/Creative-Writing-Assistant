华华和小梦的心痛苦地悬着，他们听着千里之外传来的那一片婴儿的哭声，嘴唇咬出了血。在这个通讯接口上他们等了很长时间，直到那里已集合了四百多个十岁左右的男孩儿和女孩儿，并且那些小娃娃们都喝到了奶，哭声消失，才稍稍喘了口气。\n　　“不，这不行！”小梦哭喊着，抓住华华拼命摇晃，“全国还不知有多少群小娃娃没人照顾呢！单个儿的更多了，天啊，怎么办呢？快打电话呀！快！呜呜……”\n　　“你别哭，哭有什么用？打电话，打得过来吗？！”\n　　终端屏幕上显示，这时呼叫北京的接口已以惊人的速度急增至三百万！！铃声早就不再响了，否则将响个不停。终端机机上曾显示出打入RALL命令可以进行所有通道同时放大，华华键入了这个命令后，立刻和小梦一样捂住了耳朵。\n　　一阵巨大的音浪在大厅中回响激荡，如同大海的狂潮一样，一阵高似一阵。几百万个声音都在重复着相同的两个字。\n　　“北京！”\n　　“北京！”\n　　“北京！”\n　　“北京！”\n　　“北京！！”\n　　……\n　　就在华华和小梦一愣神的时间里，呼叫的接口数又猛增了一百万，达到四百万个！那来自整个国土各个方向的声浪仿佛要把这个大厅吞没。小梦失声惊叫着，华华急忙照终端屏幕上的提示键入RSTOP命令，中心大厅中立刻安静下来，而两个孩子的神经在那声浪中已到了崩溃的边缘。\n　　他们重新开始一个挨着一个地和几百万个呼叫者通话。\n　　在这些呼叫北京的孩子们中，有三分之二是通过由程控交换机转接的长途公共电话，三分之一是借助于各地国家机关、企业甚至军队的微波和中长波通讯设施，还有少数是通过刚刚启用的卫星中转的激光束通讯。\n　　这些通讯使华华和小梦知道了这个广大国土上的孩子们现在正面临着的问题：大部分的报警和呼救都是因为火灾，这些火灾绝大多数是由电网故障引起的。火灾的的范围都还没有发展到很大，大多数火区的孩子们都已经或正在安全撤出来。北方的城市中供暖系统普遍停了，这使那些地区的孩子们面临很艰难的处境。所有城市的供水系统都瘫痪了，这在现在还问题不大，但随着时间的推移，这个问题的严重性将慢慢显示出来。但像以上那样的报警电话只占少数，大部分呼叫北京的孩子都是为了同一个问题：我们现在该怎么办？\n　　最大的危险来自孩子们本身。只有很少的地区集中了孩子，但也都是分片集中的，最大的集中群也只有六千多人。各个集中群之间没有联系。年龄较大的几个集中群（8岁以上）已趋于稳定，但普遍没有一个有效的机构来领导；而年龄较小的（5岁以下\n######################\nOutput:",
