\n　　最吸引人的地方当然是在戏场里。这种物资交流会没有不请剧团来演戏的。可怜的石圪节连块平坦的戏场也找不到，就在街东头一个小山湾的土坡上，用帆布搭了个临时戏台。另一面土坡说是观众席。这倒也好！人们在斜坡上看戏，象城里那些讲究的剧院一样，座位依次升高，谁也挡不住谁的视线。 \n　　剧团是公社徐治功主任从县上请来的，其中有几个演员在本县的知名度，大大超过了当时中国的电影名星陈冲和刘晓庆。 \n　　农历五月的阳光暖洋洋地照耀着这个人山人海的小土湾，台上台下的各种声音一片喧闹，老远就能听见那海啸般的嗡嗡声。庄稼人趟起的黄尘和各种卖茶饭的临时炉灶里升起的烟雾，笼罩在人群的上空久聚而不散。 \n　　许多人其实对戏兴趣不大，主要是转悠着吃点什么，买点什么。戏场外围的坡坡呱呱上，到处都是卖吃食和各种货物的人。这些摊贩吆喝声四起，象是专门和县剧团唱对台戏。 \n　　我们在这里发现了双水村的金俊文。这个因儿子金富的“手艺”而急骤发达起来的庄稼人，竟然弄起了一个售衣服的摊子，木杆上挑挂着金富从外地“拿”回来的各式时新成衣，人们争抢着买，生意十分兴隆。金俊文和他的精能老婆张桂兰，一个卖衣服，一个收钱，简直忙得不可开交。双水村的一些人明知道这是金富偷回来的赃物，但看见金俊文将大把的人民币塞到自己的口袋里，也着实有些眼红。只有俊文的弟弟俊武在心里冷笑。精人兼强人金俊武既然不能说服他哥认识侄儿的危险性，索性也就不再理睬他们了。虽然是一母所生的兄弟，但现在各过各的光景，出了事和他金俊武球不相干！俊武前两天也到戏场来过一回，可他决不会凑到他哥的衣服摊上去。他只是在远处瞟了一眼得意洋洋的大哥和大嫂，在心里说：好吃难消化，吃进去就怕你们屙不下！ \n　　在石圪节如此红火热闹的时候，我们一直没有看见这个大场面的总导演徐治功。 \n　　他到哪里去了？难道他这几天还下乡搞工作吗？怎么可能去下乡，他就在石圪节。 \n　　此刻，徐治功正坐在王彩娥家的沙发里，一边抽烟，一边和彩娥眉来眼去地说些不三不四的话——仅此，我们就不难看出，这两个人已经是何等关系了。 \n　　物资交流会一开始，胡得禄和王彩娥的夫妻理发\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>双水村<|>GEO<|>双水村 is a village where the events of the material exchange
