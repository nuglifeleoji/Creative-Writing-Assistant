“你待会儿不用参加新学年开学典礼了。今天咱们天罗学院本院的考官就来了。我稍候就带你过去。”\n\n    “哦，好。”蓝轩宇答应一声。他倒是不怎么紧张。考核而已，他对自己还是挺有信心的。\n\n    如果没有娜娜老师，那次天际大厦的事情，一定会在他心中留下阴影，甚至会导致他的性格出现胆怯。可娜娜老师的及时赶到，不只是救了他们母子，更重要的也是在他心中留下了不可磨灭的印象。\n\n    尤其是挥手之间击溃战舰那一幕，更是深深的烙印在了他脑海之中。他总会想：我可是娜娜老师的弟子呢。娜娜老师那么强大，我也一定会很强的。\n\n    所以，他没有怯懦，反而多了自信。\n\n    而且，自信源于努力。他自我感觉，至少在放假期间，应该没有同学比自己更努力得了。\n\n    很快，学生们都到期了，开学典礼开始，向他招了招手，秋雨馨就把蓝轩宇带出了教室。\n\n    才一出教师，蓝轩宇就看到了冷着脸的叶灵瞳。毫无疑问，叶灵瞳是代表二年级一班出来的。\n\n    两人对视一眼，不约而同的别过头去。\n\n    龚英豪和秋雨馨同样是对视一眼，秋雨馨笑眯眯的，龚英豪却是眉头微皱。上个学期蓝轩宇力克叶灵瞳的事儿可在他心中还有阴影呢。\n\n    如果说叶灵瞳是优秀的，那这蓝轩宇就有些妖孽了。明明看上去他应该是没有叶灵瞳强，可叶灵瞳却是每次就那么输在他手中。而且龚英豪完全可以肯定，叶灵瞳决非是手下留情了。\n\n    “秋老师。”龚英豪向秋雨馨打了个招呼。\n\n    “龚老师。”秋雨馨笑眯眯的回礼。\n\n    “我们一起？”龚英豪作出一个请的手势。\n\n    “好啊！”\n\n    两位老师走在前面，蓝轩宇和叶灵瞳自然就并肩走在后面。\n\n    “你死定了。”叶灵瞳没有发出声音，只是口型上威胁着蓝轩宇。\n\n    蓝轩宇撇了撇嘴，就当没看见。\n\n    叶灵瞳看着这家伙的样子恨得有些牙痒痒，就要伸出手来去抓他。蓝轩宇脚下略微一动就不着痕迹的避让了开来。\n\n    “秋老师，叶灵瞳摸我。”蓝轩宇突然叫道。\n\n    秋雨馨和龚英豪愕然回首，看到的正是叶灵瞳还伸在空中的手，而蓝轩宇则是一脸委屈的看着秋雨馨。\n\n    龚英豪忍不住道：“灵瞳，你干什么？”\n\n    “龚老师，我……”叶灵瞳想要解释，可她却发现自己根本解释不了，因为确实是自己�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
