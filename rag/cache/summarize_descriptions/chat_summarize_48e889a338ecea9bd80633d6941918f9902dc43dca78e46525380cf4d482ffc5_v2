Historically, the Harkonnens have been the aggressors, launching attacks against Atreides forces, which has further fueled the enmity between the two factions. Their conflict is deeply rooted in political, economic, and personal rivalries, with each house seeking to undermine the other through both overt and covert means. The feud has resulted in significant casualties and strategic losses for both sides, perpetuating a cycle of retaliation and distrust.
