Known for his brutality, manipulation, and strategic mind, he rules through fear and treachery, orchestrating elaborate schemes to eliminate his enemies while avoiding direct blame.  \n\nThe Baron is the **maternal grandfather of Alia Atreides**, whose spirit he later influences as a memory-self within her, offering advice and seeking a symbiotic relationship. He is also the **grandfather of Jessica** and an ancestor of **Leto II and Ghanima**, though his legacy is marked by cruelty and tyranny. His relationship with his **nephew Feyd-Rautha** is complex—acting as both mentor and manipulator, testing Feyd’s loyalty and capabilities while grooming him as a potential heir.  \n\nA key architect of the **attack on House Atreides**, the Baron conspires against **Duke Leto Atreides**, using traitors like **Dr. Yueh** and his **Mentat, Piter**, to achieve his goals. His schemes extend to the capture of **Jessica and Paul**, though his plans are ultimately thwarted by Paul’s rise as **Muad’Dib**. The Baron opposes **Paul and the Fremen**, deploying secret weapons and military force in an attempt to crush their rebellion.  \n\nDespite his death, his influence persists through Alia, haunting her with his malevolent presence. As a **ruthless strategist**, he clashes with the **Emperor** and maneuvers House Harkonnen’s political standing, ensuring its dominance through fear and deception.

Primarily composed of planet-bound entrepreneurs and minor aristocrats, they play a significant role in controlling Arrakis' interior trade under Harkonnen oversight. The Baron seeks to dominate these families through political manipulation, including the use of hostages, ensuring their loyalty and compliance. While they operate with some autonomy, the Houses Minor largely follow the directives of major houses like the Harkonnens, often appearing at the Baron's gatherings as part of his broader strategy to consolidate power.

The Baron serves as both his uncle and patron, actively grooming Feyd-Rautha as a potential heir while simultaneously overseeing his rise to power. However, their dynamic is far from harmonious; they are locked in a tense power struggle, with the Baron harboring deep-seated distrust toward his nephew despite investing in his future.  \n\nThe Baron’s mentorship of Feyd-Rautha is strategic, aimed at securing the Harkonnen legacy while maintaining control. One of his schemes involves positioning Feyd-Rautha as a savior figure to the people of Arrakis, intending to manipulate public perception by first fostering hatred toward Piter De Vries, another Harkonnen operative, before elevating his nephew as a benevolent alternative. This plan underscores the Baron’s calculated approach to succession, using Feyd-Rautha as a pawn in broader political games.  \n\nDespite the Baron’s grooming efforts, their relationship remains fraught with tension, as Feyd-Rautha’s ambition and the Baron’s paranoia create an undercurrent of rivalry. The Baron’s dual role—as both mentor and adversary—highlights the precarious balance of power within the Harkonnen dynasty, where loyalty is conditional and trust is scarce.
