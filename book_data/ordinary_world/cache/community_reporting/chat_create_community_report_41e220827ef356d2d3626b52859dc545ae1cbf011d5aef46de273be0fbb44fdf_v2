In his role, he was involved in local governance and participated in the implementation of the production responsibility system. However, his career has been marked by challenges and controversies.\n\n高凤阁 had ambitions to ascend to the position of district committee secretary but faced setbacks due to political dynamics and opposition, which ultimately led to his reassignment to a different region. Previously, he was the commissioner of a southern region but was removed from that position, indicating a turbulent political trajectory.\n\nHis involvement in governance took a critical turn during a flood disaster, where he was appointed as the chief commander of the flood prevention headquarters. However, during this crucial time, he was criticized for negligence, particularly for being absent due to his son's wedding. This absence during a critical moment led to accusations of dereliction of duty, and he is currently under investigation for his actions during the disaster, facing the possibility of severe penalties.\n\nIn addition to his administrative roles, 高凤阁 has been noted for his personal connections, being a cousin to the Hu brothers, which may have influenced his political standing.
