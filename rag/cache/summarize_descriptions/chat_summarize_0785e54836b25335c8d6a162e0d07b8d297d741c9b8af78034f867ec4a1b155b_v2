It encompasses the planet Buzzell, which has been a notable location under Bene Gesserit influence. In later periods, the Old Empire became a focal point for the return of powerful figures like Dama and other Honored Matres, though their motivations for reestablishing a presence there remain unclear. The region's long-standing importance in human history, combined with its connections to these formidable groups, underscores its enduring political and cultural relevance.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing its historical role, others highlighting contemporary developments—they collectively paint the Old Empire as a nexus of power, tradition, and intrigue.
