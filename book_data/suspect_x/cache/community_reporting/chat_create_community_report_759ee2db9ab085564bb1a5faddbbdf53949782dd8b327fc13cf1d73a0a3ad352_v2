Initially, it was ruled by the **Padishah Emperor**, who held dominion over all noble Houses and worlds within its domain. Later, leadership transitioned to **Leto**, who continued to oversee the empire's expansive territories and complex political landscape. Eventually, the empire came under the rule of **Muad'Dib**, marking another significant era in its history.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary in naming the ruler—whether the Padishah Emperor, Leto, or Muad'Dib—they collectively emphasize the Imperium's immense scale and influence across the cosmos. The discrepancies in leadership likely reflect different periods in the empire's timeline rather than contradictions. Thus, the Imperium can be summarized as a dominant galactic power, governed by a succession of formidable leaders, each shaping its destiny across multiple factions and planets.\",19\r\n8,LANDSRAAD,\"The **Landsraad** is a feudal assembly of the Great Houses in the **Dune** universe, serving as a key political and legislative body within the **Imperium**. Composed of noble houses, it functions as a collective to mediate disputes, negotiate treaties, and maintain the balance of power against the **Emperor**, the **Spacing Guild**, and **CHOAM**. Historically, it played a stabilizing role during the chaotic period of the **Butlerian Jihad** and later acted as a check on imperial authority, ensuring no single faction dominated the political landscape.  \n\nThe Landsraad is deeply involved in governance, power struggles, and economic interests, particularly through its ties to **CHOAM** and the spice trade. It has been a forum for justice, such as addressing grievances against **House Corrino** or the treachery of the **Sardaukar**. Political maneuvering within the Landsraad is frequent, as seen when **House Atreides** planned to use captured Sardaukar to influence its decisions.  \n\nDuring **Paul Atreides'** rise as **Muad'Dib**, the Landsraad was initially suspicious following the **Arrakis Affair**, though **Count Fenring** helped allay concerns. Paul later sought to unite the noble houses under his rule, though under **Leto II's** reign, the Landsraad was eventually dissolved.  \n\nWhile the Landsraad primarily represents the Great Houses, it has no direct affiliation with the **Fremen**. Its role as a restraining force in the Empire, alongside the Guild, underscores its importance in maintaining political equilibrium. Overall, the Landsraad is a central institution in the **Dune** saga, shaping alliances, conflicts, and the broader dynamics of the Imperium.\",13\r\n468,TUPILE ENTENTE,\"The Tupile Entente is a treaty and sanctuary for defeated Great Houses.
