No lens or other artifice masked them.\n“You have the right look about you,” Sirafa said. “Remember that you are a special kind of playfem and Burzmali is your customer. No ordinary person would interfere with that.”\nLucilla heard a veiled hint in this. “But there are those who might interfere?”\n“Embassies from great religions are on Gammu now,” Sirafa said. “Some you have never encountered. They are from what you call the Scattering.”\n“And what do you call it?”\n“The Seeking.” Sirafa raised a placating hand. “Do not fear! We have a common enemy.”\n“The Honored Matres?”\nSirafa turned her head to the left and spat on the floor. “Look at me, Bene Gesserit! | was trained only to kill them! That is my only function and purpose!”\nLucilla spoke carefully: “From what we know, you must be very good.”\n“In some things, perhaps | am better than you. Now listen! You are a sexual adept. Do you understand?”\n“Why would priests interfere?”\n“You call them priests? Well... yes. They would not interfere for any reason you might imagine. Sex for pleasure, the enemy of religion, eh?”\n“Accept no substitutes for holy joy,” Lucilla said.\n“Tantrus protect you, woman! There are different priests from the Seeking, ones who do not mind offering immediate ecstasy instead of a promised hereafter.”\nLucilla almost smiled. Did this self-styled killer of Honored Matres think she could advise a Reverend Mother on religions?\n“There are people here who go about disguised as priests,” Sirafa said. “Very dangerous. The most dangerous of all are those who follow Tantrus and claim that sex is the exclusive worship of their god.”\n“How will | know them?” Lucilla heard sincerity in Sirafa’s voice and a sense of foreboding.\n“That is not a concern. You must never act as though you recognize such distinctions. Your first concern is to make sure of your pay. You, | think, should ask fifty solari.”\n“You have not told me why they would interfere.” Lucilla glanced back at Burzmali. He had laid out the rough clothing and was taking off his battle fatigues. She returned her attention to Sirafa.\n“Some follow an ancient convention that grants them the right to disrupt your arrangement with Burzmali. In actuality, some will be testing you.”\n“Listen carefully,” Burzmali said. “This is important.”\nSirafa said: “Burzmali will be dressed as a field worker. Nothing else could disguise his weapon’s calluses. You will address him as Skar, a common name here.”\n“But how do | deal with a priest’s interruption?”\nSirafa produced a small pouch from her bodice and passed it to Lucilla, who hefted it in one hand. “That contains two hundred and eighty-three solari. If someone identifying himself as a divine . . . You remember that? Divine?”\n“How could | forget it?” Lucilla’s voice was almost a sneer but Sirafa paid no heed.\n“If such a one interferes, you will return fifty solari to Burzmali with your regrets. Also, in that pouch is your playfem card in the name of Pira. Let me hear you say your name.”\n“Pira.”\n“No! Accent much harder on the ‘a’!”\n“Pira!”\n“That is passable. Now listen to me with extreme care. You and Burzmali will be on the streets late. It will be expected that you have had previous customers. There must be evidence. Therefore, you will... ahhh, entertain Burzmali before leaving here. You understand?”\n“Such delicacy!” Lucilla said.\nSirafa took it as a compliment and smiled, but it was a tightly controlled expression. Her reactions were so alien!\n“One thing,” Lucilla said. “If | must entertain a divine, how will | find Burzmali afterward?”\n“Skar!”\n“Yes. How will | find Skar?”\n“He will wait nearby wherever you go. Skar will find you when you emerge.”\n“Very well. If a d/vine interrupts, | return one hundred solari to Skar and—”\n“Fifty!”\n“I think not, Sirafa.” Lucilla shook her head slowly from side to side. “After being entertained by me, the divine will know that fifty solari is too small a sum.”\nSirafa pursed her lips and glanced past Lucilla at Burzmali. “You warned me about her kind but | did not Suppose that...”\nUsing only a touch of Voice, Lucilla said: “You suppose nothing unless you hear it from me!”\nSirafa scowled. She was obviously startled by Voice, but her tone was just as arrogant when she resumed. “Do | presume that you need no explanation of sexual variations?”\n“A safe assumption,” Lucilla said.\n“And | do not need to tell you that your robe identifies you as a fifth-stage adept in the Order of Hormu?”\nIt was Lucilla’s turn to scowl. “What if | show abilities beyond this fifth stage?”\n“Ahhhhh,” Sirafa said. “You will continue to heed my words, then?”\nLucilla nodded curtly.\n“Very good,” Sirafa said. “May | presume you can administer vaginal pulsing?”\n“| can.”\n“From any position?”\n“I can control any muscle in my body!”\nSirafa glanced past Lucilla at Burzmali. “True?”\nBurzmali spoke from close behind Lucilla: “Or she would not claim it.”\nSirafa looked thoughtful, her focus on Lucilla’s chin. “This is a complication, | think.”\n“Lest you get the wrong idea,” Lucilla said, “the abilities | was taught are not usually marketed. They have another purpose.”\n“Oh, I’m sure they do,” Sirafa said. “But sexual agility is a\n4\n“Agility!” Lucilla allowed her tone to convey the full weight of a Reverend Mother’s outrage. No matter that this might be what Sirafa hoped to achieve, she had to be put in her place! “Agility, you say? | can control genital temperature. | know and can arouse the fifty-one excitation points. |—”\n“Fifty-one? But there are only—”\n“Fifty-one!” Lucilla snapped. “And the sequencing plus the combinations number two thousand and eight. Furthermore, in combination with the two hundred and five sexual positions—”\n“Two hundred and five?” Sirafa was clearly startled. “Surely, you don’t mean—”\n“More, actually, if you count minor variations. |am an Imprinter, which means | have mastered the three hundred steps of orgasmic amplification!”\nSirafa cleared her throat and wet her lips with her tongue. “I must warn you then to restrain yourself. Keep your full\nabilities unexpressed or...” Once more, she looked at Burzmali. “Why didn’t you warn me?”\n“| did.”\nLucilla clearly heard amusement in his voice but did not look back to confirm it.\nSirafa inhaled and expelled two hard breaths. “If any questions are asked, you will say you are about to undergo testing for advancement. That may quiet suspicion.”\n“And if I’m asked about the test.”\n“Oh, that is easy. You smile mysteriously and remain silent.”\n“What if I’m asked about this Order of Hormu?”\n“Threaten to report the questioner to your superiors. The questions should stop.”\n“And if they don’t?”\nSirafa shrugged. “Make up any story you like. Evena Truth-sayer would be amused by your evasions.”\nLucilla held her face in repose while she thought about her situation. She heard Burzmali—Skar!—stirring directly behind her. She saw no serious difficulties in carrying out this deception. It might even provide an amusing interlude she could recount later at Chapter House. Sirafa, she noted, was grinning at Burz—Skar! Lucilla turned and looked at her customer.\nBurzmali stood there naked, his battle garb and helmet neatly stacked beside the small mound of rough clothing.\n“I can see that Skar does not object to your preparations for this venture,” Sirafa said. She waved a hand at his stiffly upcocked penis. “I will leave you, then.”\nLucilla heard Sirafa depart through the shimmering curtain. Filling Lucilla’s thoughts was an angry realization:\n“This should be the ghola here now!”\nIt is your fate, forgetfulness. All of the old lessons of life, you lose and gain and lose and gain again.\n—LETO II, THE VOICE OF DAR-ES-BALAT\nll | n the name of our Order and its unbroken Sisterhood, this account has been judged reliable and worthy of entry into the Chronicles of Chapter House.”\nTaraza stared at the words on her display projection with an expression of distaste. Morning light painted a fuzz of yellow reflections in the projection, making the words there appear dimly mysterious.\nWith an angry motion, Taraza pushed herself back from the projection table, arose and went to a south window. The day was young yet and the shadows long in her courtyard.\nShall I go in person?\nReluctance filled her at this thought. These quarters felt so . .. SO secure. But that was foolishness and she knew it in every fiber. The Bene Gesserit had been here more than fourteen hundred years and still Chapter House Planet must be considered only temporary.\nShe rested her left hand on the smooth frame of the window. Each of her windows had been positioned to focus the attention on a splendid view. The room—its proportions, furnishing, colors—all reflected architects and builders who had worked single-mindedly to create a sense of support for the occupants.\nTaraza tried to immerse herself in that supportive feeling and failed.\nThe arguments she had just experienced left a bitterness in this room even though the words had been voiced in the\nmildest tones. Her councillors had been stubborn and (she agreed without reservation) for understandable reasons.\nMake ourselves into missionaries? And for the Tleilaxu?\nShe touched a control plate beside the window and opened it. A warm breeze perfumed by spring blossoms from the apple orchards wafted into the room. The Sisterhood was proud of the fruit they grew here at the power center of all their strongholds. No finer orchards existed at any of the Keeps and Dependent Chapters that wove the Bene Gesserit web through most of the planets humans had occupied under the Old Imperium.\n“By their fruits, ye shall know them,” she thought. Some of the old religions can still produce wisdom.\nFrom her high vantage, Taraza could see the entire southern sprawl of Chapter House buildings. The shadow of a nearby watchtower drew a long uneven line across rooftops and courtyards.\nWhen she thought about it, she knew this was a surprisingly small establishment to contain so much power. Beyond the ring of orchards and gardens lay a careful checkerboard of private residences, each with its surrounding plantation. Retired Sisters and selected loyal families occupied these privileged estates. Sawtoothed mountains, their tops often brilliant with snow, drew the western limits. The spacefield lay twenty kilometers eastward. All around this core of Chapter House were open plains where grazed a peculiar breed of cattle, a cattle so susceptible to alien odors they would stampede in raucous bellowing at the slightest intrusion of people not marked by the local smell. The innermost homes with their pain-fenced plantings had been sited by an early Bashar in such a way that no one could move through the twisting ground-level channels day or night without being observed.\nIt all appeared so haphazard and casual, yet there was harsh order in it.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d97c863c32d164135565d6818c08bc9b2da4f362597e9f9ee32ae4670b7a8e6b_v2"}
