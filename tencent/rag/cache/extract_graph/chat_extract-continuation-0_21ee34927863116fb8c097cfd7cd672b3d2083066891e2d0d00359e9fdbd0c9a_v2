His jaw dropped. He stared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.\n“Well, Captain Aramsham,” Paul said, “the Harkonnens would pay dearly to learn what you now know. And the Emperor—what he wouldn’t give to learn an Atreides still lives despite his treachery.”\nThe captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him. Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the man’s head. Sardaukar did not Submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.\nStill using the Voice, Paul said: “Submit, Captain.”\nThe man at the captain’s left leaped without warning toward Paul, met the flashing impact of his own captain’s knife in his chest. The attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.\nThe captain faced his sole remaining companion. “| decide what best serves His Majesty,” he said. “Understood?”\nThe other Sardaukar’s shoulders slumped.\n“Drop your weapon,” the captain said.\nThe Sardaukar obeyed.\nThe captain returned his attention to Paul. “I have killed a friend for you,” he said. “Let us always remember that.”\n“You're my prisoners,” Paul said. “You submitted to me. Whether you live or die is of no importance.” He\nmotioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar, signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.\nThe guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.\nPaul bent toward his lieutenant.\n“Muad’Dib,” the man said. “I failed you in....”\n“The failure was mine, Korba,” Paul said. “l Should’ve warned you what to seek. In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this. Remember, too, that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items secreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter. They'll have more than one false tooth. They carry coils of shigawire in their hair—so fine you can barely detect it, yet strong enough to garrote a man and cut off his head in the process. With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope them—both reflex and hard ray— cut off every scrap of body hair. And when you’re through, be certain you haven’t discovered everything.”\nHe looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.\n“Then we best kill them,” the lieutenant said.\nPaul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. “No. | want them to escape.”\nGurney stared at him. “Sire....” he breathed.\n“Yes?”\n“Your man here is right. Kill those prisoners at once. Destroy all evidence of them. You’ve shamed Imperial Sardaukar! When the Emperor learns that he'll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.”\n“The Emperor’s not likely to have that power over me,” Paul said. He spoke slowly, coldly. Something had happened inside him while he faced the Sardaukar. A sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness. “Gurney,” he said, “are there many Guildsmen around Rabban?”\nGurney straightened, eyes narrowed. “Your question makes no....”\n“Are there?” Paul barked.\n“Arrakis is crawling with Guild agents. They’re buying spice as though it were the most precious thing in the universe. Why else do you think we ventured this far tnto....”\n“It is the most precious thing in the universe,” Paul said. “To them.”\nHe looked toward Stilgar and Chani who were now crossing the chamber toward him. “And we control it, Gurney.”\n“The Harkonnens control it!” Gurney protested.\n“The people who can destroy a thing, they control it,” Paul said. He waved a hand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar who stopped in front of Paul, Chani beside him.\nPaul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar. “You live for the good of the tribe,” Paul said. “Could you draw my life’s blood with that knife?”\n“For the good of the tribe,” Stilgar growled.\n“Then use that knife,” Paul said.\n“Are you Calling me out?” Stilgar demanded.\n“If | do,” Paul said, “I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay me.”\nStilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.\nChani said, “Usul!” then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.\nWhile Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: “You are Stilgar, a fighting man. When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in the front of battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani.”\n“She's my niece,” Stilgar said. “If there’d been any doubt of your Fedaykin handling those scum....”\n“Why was your first thought of Chani?” Paul demanded.\n“It wasn't!”\n“Oh?”\n“It was of you,” Stilgar admitted.\n“Do you think you could lift your hand against me?” Paul asked.\nStilgar began to tremble. “It’s the way,” he muttered.\n“It’s the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their water as a gift from Shai- hulud,” Paul said. “Yet you permitted two such to live one night, my mother and myself.”\nAs Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: “Ways change, Stil. You have changed them yourself.”\nStilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held.\n“When I am Duke in Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think l'Il have time to concern myself with every detail of governing Tabr sietch?” Paul\nasked. “Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family?”\nStilgar continued staring at the knife.\n“Do you think | wish to cut off my right arm?” Paul demanded.\nSlowly, Stilgar looked up at him.\n“You!” Paul said. “Do you think | wish to deprive myself or the tribe of your wisdom and strength?”\nIn a low voice, Stilgar said: “The young man of my tribe whose name is known to me, this young man | could kill on the challenge floor, Shai-hulud willing. The Lisan al-Gaib, him | could not harm. You knew this when you handed me this knife.”\n“I knew it,” Paul agreed.\nStilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the floor. “Ways change,” he Said.\n“Chant,” Paul said, “go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be available into—”\n“But you said we would go to the south!” she protested.\n“I was wrong,” he said. “The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not there.”\nShe took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all necessities in the midst of a life involved with death.\n“You will give my mother a message for her ears alone,” Paul said. “Tell her that Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be found to make the young men accept this without combat.”\nChani glanced at Stilgar.\n“Do as he says,” Stilgar growled. “We both know he could overcome me...and I could not raise my hand against him...for the good of the tribe.”\n“I shall return with your mother,” Chani said.\n“Send her,” Paul said. “Stilgar’s instinct was right. | am stronger when you are safe. You will remain in the sietch.”\nShe started to protest, swallowed it.\n“Sihaya,” Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to the right, met Gurney’s glaring eyes.\nThe interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a cloud around Gurney since Paul’s reference to his mother.\n“Your mother,” Gurney said.\n“Idaho saved us the night of the raid,” Paul said, distracted by the parting with Chani. “Right now we've—”\n“What of Duncan Idaho, m’Lord?” Gurney asked.\n“He’s dead—buying us a bit of time to escape.”\nThe she-witch alive! Gurney thought. The one | swore vengeance against, alive! And it’s obvious Duke Paul doesn’t know what manner of creature gave him birth. The evil one: Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!\nPaul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge. He glanced back, noted that the wounded and dead had been removed, and he thought bitterly that here was another chapter in the legend of Paul-Muad’Dib. / didn’t even draw my knife, but it'll be said of this day that | slew twenty Sardaukar by my own hand.\nGurney followed with Stilgar, stepping on ground that he did not even feel. The cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by rage. The she-witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves. | must contrive it that Paul learns the truth about her before I slay her.\nHow often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe crowd in the cavern assembly chamber\nradiated that pack feeling Jessica had sensed the day Paul killed Jamis. There was murmuring nervousness in the voices. Little cliques gathered like knots among the robes.\nJessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the ledge from Paul’s private quarters. She felt rested after the long journey up from the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the captured ornithopters.\n“We do not have full control of the air,” he had said. “And we must not become dependent upon offworld fuel. Both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and saved for the day of maximum effort.”\nPaul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge. The pale light of glowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality. It was like a tableau, but with the added dimension of warren smells, the whispers, the sounds of shuffling feet.\nShe studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise—Gurney Halleck. The thought of Gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier past—days of love and beauty with Paul’s father.\nStilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge. There was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without talking.\nWe must not lose that man, Jessica thought. Paul’s plan must work. Anything else would be the highest tragedy.\nShe strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down into the crowd. A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul. And silence followed her.\nShe knew the meaning of the silence—the unspoken questions of the people, awe of the Reverend Mother.\nThe young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him. “AN men beneath your position covet your station,” went the Bene Gesserit axiom. But she found no covetousness\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FEDAYKIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fedaykin are a group of Fremen warriors loyal to Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, who fight against the Harkonnens and the Sardaukar>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, is the leader of the Fremen and the Fedaykin, and the son of Duke Leto Atreides.
