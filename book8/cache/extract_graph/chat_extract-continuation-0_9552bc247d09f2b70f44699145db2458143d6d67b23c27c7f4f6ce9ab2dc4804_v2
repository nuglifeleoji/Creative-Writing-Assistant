左手掌心之上的蓝银草表面，出现了一些细密的银色纹路，这些银色纹路就像是蓝银草的叶蔓，只是很淡的银色，并不耀眼。\n\n    而右手掌心之上的蓝银草表面，出现的却是金色纹路，略微粗大一些，但也是光晕内敛。散发着淡淡的金色。\n\n    如果不是仔细辨认，或许都不是太容易看清这金银双色。可对于蓝潇来说，这却简直是惊天动地啊！\n------------\n\n第十四章 蓝潇的混乱\n\n    “你、你这两个环……”\n\n    在魂师的世界，魂环也是分层次的，远古时期开始，就是根据提供魂环的魂兽等级来划分。分别是白色的十年魂环，黄色的百年魂环，紫色的千年魂环，黑色的万年魂环和红色的十万年魂环。年头越长，就意味着魂环越强。\n\n    除了这几种之外，还有一些特殊颜色的魂环也曾出现过。譬如超过十万年以上的，就有橙金色魂环，那就是传说中的存在了。\n\n    而此时，看上去在蓝轩宇蓝银草周围围绕着的不过是白色魂环，代表着最低层次十年的白色。这对于低阶魂师来说也是正常情况。毕竟，刚开始修炼就想要获得更高层次魂环是很难的。按照理论研究，人体在一环时所能承受的最高层次也就是百年魂环而已。\n\n    可问题是，蓝轩宇身上这白色魂环并不是从魂灵处获得的，只是隔了一晚上啊！准确的说，他只是睡了一觉就自己有了魂环。这意味着什么？\n\n    蓝潇是搞古魂兽研究的，这种情况只会是意味着一件事。\n\n    魂兽修炼到十万年之后，一般有两种选择，要么尝试继续突破，走向更高层次。可突破时却会有危险，很可能就会陨落。而另一条路就是重修成人。把自己转化成人类从头开始，尝试通过人类的方式修炼突破到神阶，拥有悠长的生命。\n\n    而魂兽重修，有一个显著特点就是，它们是不需要通过魂灵或者是猎杀魂兽来获得魂环的，每当修为达到一定层次之后，自己就会有魂环复苏，从而拥有相应的能力。\n\n    蓝潇联想到蓝轩宇的来历，再加上此时魂环的自行出现，他哪还猜不出，这个孩子很可能是魂兽重修的啊！\n\n    可是，一般来说，魂兽重修都会带有之前记忆的。可从所有的试验以及这些年小轩宇的表现来看，他根本就没有什么之前的记忆。\n\n    蓝潇有些混乱了，按照古魂兽的研究，十万年魂兽就算重修，在修炼到七十级之前，其实还是魂\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝银草<|>ORGANIZATION<|>蓝银草 is a type of plant that exhibits
