You’ve learned only a limited way of looking at the universe. Now you must make the universe your own creation. This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining.”\n“How long did you say it takes?”\n“Patience,” she reminded him.\nA spontaneous grin touched his lips. His eyes wavered toward her.\n“Look at your hands!” she snapped.\nThe grin vanished. His gaze jerked back to a fixated concentration upon his extended hands.\n“What do | do when my arms get tired?” he asked.\n“Stop talking and concentrate,” she said. “If you become too tired, stop. Return to it after a few minutes of relaxation and exercise. You must persist in this until you succeed. At your present stage, this is more important than you could possibly realize. Learn this lesson or the others will not come.”\nFarad’n inhaled a deep breath, chewed his lips, stared at his hands. He turned them slowly: front, back, front, back. ... His shoulders trembled with fatigue. Front, back. ... Nothing changed.\nJessica arose, crossed to the only door.\nHe spoke without removing his attention from his hands. “Where are you going?”\n“You'll work better on this if you’re alone. l'Il return in about an hour. Patience.”\n“I know!”\nShe studied him a moment. How intent he looked. He reminded her with a heart-tugging abruptness of her own lost son. She permitted herself a sigh, said: “When | return l'Il give you the exercise lessons to relieve your muscles. Give it time. You’ll be astonished at what you can make your body and your senses do.”\nShe let herself out.\nThe omnipresent guards took up station three paces behind her as she strode down the hall. Their awe and fear were obvious. They were Sardaukar, thrice-warned of her prowess, raised on the stories of their defeat by the Fremen of Arrakis. This witch was a Fremen Reverend Mother, a Bene Gesserit and an Atreides.\nJessica, glancing back, saw their stern faces as a mile- post in her design. She turned away as she came to the stairs, went down them and through a short passage into the garden below her windows.\nNow if only Duncan and Gurney can do their parts, she thought as she felt the gravel of a pathway beneath her feet, saw the golden light filtered by greenery.\nYou will learn the integrated communication methods as you complete the next step in your mental education.

Without mentat overlay integration, you can be immersed in the Babel Problem, which is the label we give to the omnipresent dangers of achieving wrong combinations from accurate information.\n—THE MENTAT HANDBOOK\nhe sound of fabrics rubbing together sent sparks of\nawareness through Leto. He was surprised that he had tuned his sensitivity to the point where he automatically identified the fabrics from their sound: the combination came from a Fremen robe rubbing against the coarse hangings of a door curtain. He turned toward the sound. It came from the passage where Namri had gone minutes before. As Leto turned, he saw his captor enter. It was the Same man who had taken him prisoner: the same dark strip of skin above the stillsuit mask, the identical searing eyes. The man lifted a hand to his mask, slipped the catchtube from his nostrils, lowered the mask and, in the same motion, flipped his hood back. Even before he focused on the scar of the inkvine whip along the man’s jaw, Leto recognized him. The recognition was a totality in his awareness with the search for confirming details coming afterward. No mistake about it, this rolling lump of humanity, this warrior- troubadour, was Gurney Halleck!\nLeto clenched his hands into fists, overcome momentarily\nby the shock of recognition. No Atreides retainer had ever\nbeen more loyal. None better at shield fighting. He’d been Paul’s trusted confidant and teacher.\nHe was the Lady Jessica’s servant.\nThese recognitions and more surged through Leto’s mind. Gurney was his captor. Gurney and Namri were in this conspiracy together. And Jessica’s hand was in it with them.\n“I understand you’ve met our Namri,” Halleck said. “Pray believe him, young sir. He has one function and one function only. He’s the one capable of killing you should the need arise.”\nLeto responded automatically with his father’s tones: “So you've joined my enemies, Gurney! | never thought the—”\n“Try none of your devil tricks on me, lad,” Halleck said. “I’m proof against them all. | follow your grandmother’s orders. Your education has been planned to the last detail. It was she who approved my selection of Namri. What comes next, painful as it may seem, is at her command.”\n“And what does she command?”\nHalleck lifted a hand from the folds of his robe, exposed a Fremen injector, primitive but efficient. Its transparent tube was charged with blue fluid.\nLeto squirmed backward on the cot, was stopped by the rock wall. As he moved, Namri entered, stood beside Halleck with hand on crysknife. Together they blocked the only exit.\n“| see you’ve recognized the spice essence,” Halleck said. “You're to take the worm trip, lad. You must go through it. Otherwise, what your father dared and you dare not would hang over you for the rest of your days.”\nLeto shook his head wordlessly. This was the thing he and Ghanima knew could overwhelm them. Gurney was an ignorant fool! How could Jessica. . . Leto felt the father- presence in his memories. It surged into his mind, trying to Strip away his defenses. Leto wanted to shriek outrage, could not move his lips. But this was the wordless thing which his pre-born awareness most feared. This was prescient trance, the reading of immutable future with all of\nits fixity and its terrors. Surely Jessica could not have ordered such an ordeal for her own grandson. But her presence loomed in his mind, filling him with acceptance arguments. Even the Litany Against Fear was pressed upon him with a repetitive droning: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past... .”\nWith an oath already ancient when Chaldea was young, Leto tried to move, tried to leap at the two men standing over him, but his muscles refused to obey. As though he already existed in the trance, Leto saw Halleck’s hand move, the injector approach. The light of a glowglobe sparkled within the blue fluid. The injector touched Leto’s left arm. Pain lanced through him, shot upward to the muscles of his head.\nAbruptly Leto saw a young woman sitting outside a crude hut in dawnlight. She sat right there in front of him roasting coffee beans to a rose brown, adding cardamom and melange. The voice of a rebeck echoed from somewhere behind him. The music echoed and echoed until it entered his head, still echoing. It suffused his body and he felt himself to be large, very large, not a child at all. And his skin was not his own. He knew that sensation! His skin was not his own. Warmth spread through his body. As abruptly as his first vision, he found himself standing in darkness. It was night. Stars like a rain of embers fell in gusts from a brilliant cosmos.\nPart of him knew there was no escaping, but still he tried to fight it until the father-presence intruded. “I will protect you in the trance. The others within will not take you.”\nWind tumbled Leto, rolled him, hissing, pouring dust and sand over him, cutting his arms, his face, abrading his clothes, whipping the loose-torn ends of now useless fabric. But he felt no pain and he saw the cuts heal as rapidly as\nthey appeared. Still he rolled with the wind. And his skin was not his own.\nIt will happen! he thought.\nBut the thought was distant and came as though it were not his own, not really his own; no more than his skin.\nThe vision absorbed him. It evolved into a stereologic memory which separated past and present, future and present, future and past. Each separation mingled into a trinocular focus which he sensed as the multidimensional relief map of his own future existence.\nHe thought: Time is a measure of space, just as a range- finder is a measure of space, but measuring locks us into the place we measure.\nHe sensed the trance deepening. It came as an amplification of internal consciousness which his self- identity soaked up and through which he felt himself changing. It was living Time and he could not arrest an instant of it. Memory fragments, future and past, deluged him. But they existed as montage-in-motion. Their relationships underwent a constant dance. His memory was a lens, an illuminating searchlight which picked out fragments, isolating them, but forever failing to stop the ceaseless motion and modification which surged into his view.\nThat which he and Ghanima had planned came through the searchlight, dominating everything, but now it terrified him. Vision reality ached in him. The uncritical inevitability made his ego cringe.\nAnd his skin was not his own! Past and present tumbled through him, surging across the barriers of his terror. He could not separate them. One moment he felt himself setting forth on the Butlerian Jihad, eager to destroy any machine which simulated human awareness. That had to be the past—over and done with. Yet his senses hurtled through the experience, absorbing the most minute details. He heard a minister-companion speaking from a pulpit: “We\nmust negate the machines-that-think. Humans must set their own guidelines. This is not something machines can do. Reasoning depends upon programming, not on hardware, and we are the ultimate program!”\nHe heard the voice clearly, knew his surroundings—a vast wooden hall with dark windows. Light came from sputtering flames. And his minister-companion said: “Our Jihad Is a ‘dump program.’ We dump the things which destroy us as humans!”\nAnd it was in Leto’s mind that the speaker had been a servant of computers, one who knew them and serviced them. But the scene vanished and Ghanima stood in front of him, saying: “Gurney knows. He told me. They’re Duncan’s words and Duncan was speaking as a mentat. ‘In doing good, avoid notoriety; in doing evil, avoid self-awareness. ’”\nThat had to be future—far future. But he felt the reality. It was as intense as any past from his multitude of lives. And he whispered: “Isn’t that true, father?”\nBut the father-presence within spoke warningly: “Don’t invite disaster! You’re learning stroboscopic awareness now. Without it you could overrun yourself, lose your place-mark in Time.”\nAnd the bas-relief imagery\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_11c7beb9041d3e473664ea839aa24ad940067ece884ac18e6e659b2ba4c4ad0b_v2"}
