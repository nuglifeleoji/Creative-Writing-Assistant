中了孩子，但也都是分片集中的，最大的集中群也只有六千多人。各个集中群之间没有联系。年龄较大的几个集中群（8岁以上）已趋于稳定，但普遍没有一个有效的机构来领导；而年龄较小的（5岁以下）和年龄混杂的集中群则全部处于动荡状态，他们无法解决眼前面临的各种危机（食物，水，住所，火灾和疾病等），随时都会解体；最危险的还是那些年龄最小的集中群，他们全是幼儿甚至婴儿，虽然大人们走时都安排了年龄较大的孩子来看护，大部分是两个或更多大孩子看护一个小娃娃，但那些小看护者们在精神上被昨天的大死亡完全击倒了，他们连自己都控制不了，更照顾不了他们所看护的几百甚至几千个小娃娃了。从总的情况来看，以上的那些孩子们情况还算好。在这块广阔的国土上，散布着超新星灾难后留下来的三亿多11岁以下的孩子，他们的百分之九十仍处于分散状态，相互之间没有任何联系，他们中的一半年龄在5岁以下，不具备应付危险和事变的最起码的能力，特别是那些3岁以下的孩子，连在封闭环境中独自生存的能力都没有！\n　　大死亡之后的寒夜和太空中出现的那朵巨大而怪异的星云使孩子们不敢离开家一步，只能在寒冷和恐惧中发抖。从整体上来说，国土的各部分已没有任何联系，此时的国家就像一个已剥去外壳，只有一层软软的薄膜包着的生蛋，抗不住任何灾难，轻轻一触就会破碎。\n　　在广阔的国土上，除了那些通过各种通讯设施呼北京的孩子外，几乎所有5岁以上的孩子都守在电视机和收音机旁，但什么也收不到。三亿多孩子像三亿多只失群的羊羔，虽然天正在亮起来，他们的恐惧感和独孤感却越来越深，以下是两个孩子在30年后的回忆：\n　　当时在客厅里有五个孩子，我最大，6岁，其余4个都在5岁以下，都是这单元过来的。现在的年轻人会问我们：那时你们都在一夜间失去了双亲，真没法想像你们会悲伤成什么样子。其实，当时压倒我们根本不是悲伤，而是孤独和恐惧，哦，还有恼怒，对已离去的大人们的恼怒：爸爸妈妈真的就这么丢下我们走了？！也许你们现在听了不可理解，但回忆当时我深深地体会到：人类对死亡的适应能力远大于对孤独的适应能力。那并不是你们现在时髦地到处议论到处表现的那种“现代人的孤独感”，不管你们怎么表白，我还是要说你们根本不知道真正的孤独为何物！因为当你们认为自己是处于孤独中时，世界却正在你们身边活生生地运转。而我们那时，天啊，我们周围的世界仿佛已经死了，仿佛只剩下我们这间\n######################\nOutput:",
