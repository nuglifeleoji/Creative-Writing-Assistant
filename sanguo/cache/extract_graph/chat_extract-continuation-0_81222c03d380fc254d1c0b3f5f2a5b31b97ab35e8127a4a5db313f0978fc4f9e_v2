：“真神仙也！人言信不诬矣！”遂与小童同入仙庄，拜见李意，宣天子诏命。李意推老不行。震曰：“天子急欲见仙翁一面，幸勿吝鹤驾。”再三敦请，李意方行。即至御营，入见先主。先主见李意鹤发童颜，碧眼方瞳，灼灼有光，身如古柏之状，知是异人，优礼相待。李意曰：“老夫乃荒山村叟，无学无识。辱陛下宣召，不知有何见谕？”先主曰：“朕与关、张二弟生死之交，三十余年矣。今二弟被害，亲统大军报仇，未知休咎如何。久闻仙翁通晓玄机，望乞赐教。”李意曰：“此乃天数，非老夫所知也。”先主再三求问，意乃索纸笔画兵马器械四十余张，画毕便一一扯碎。又画一大人仰卧于地上，傍边一人掘土埋之，上写一大“白”字，遂稽首而去。先主不悦，谓群臣曰：“此狂叟也！不足为信。”即以火焚之，便催军前进。\n\n    张苞入奏曰：“吴班军马已至。小臣乞为先锋。”先主壮其志，即取先锋印赐张苞。苞方欲挂印，又一少年将奋然出曰：“留下印与我！”视之，乃关兴也。苞曰：“我已奉诏矣。”兴曰：“汝有何能，敢当此任？”苞曰：“我自幼习学武艺，箭无虚发。”先主曰：“朕正要观贤侄武艺，以定优劣。”苞令军士于百步之外，立一面旗，旗上画一红心。苞拈弓取箭，连射三箭，皆中红心。众皆称善。关兴挽弓在手曰：“射中红心何足为奇？”正言间，忽值头上一行雁过。兴指曰：“吾射这飞雁第三只。”一箭射去，那只雁应弦而落。文武官僚，齐声喝采。苞大怒，飞身上马，手挺父所使丈八点钢矛，大叫曰：“你敢与我比试武艺否？”兴亦上马，绰家传大砍刀纵马而出曰：“偏你能使矛！吾岂不能使刀！”\n\n    二将方欲交锋，先主喝曰：“二子休得无礼！”兴、苞二人慌忙下马，各弃兵器，拜伏请罪。先主曰：“朕自涿郡与卿等之父结异姓之交，亲如骨肉；今汝二人亦是昆仲之分，正当同心协力，共报父仇；奈何自相争竞，失其大义！父丧未远而犹如此，况日后乎？”二人再拜伏罪。先主问曰：“卿二人谁年长？”苞曰：“臣长关兴一岁。”先主即命兴拜苞为兄。二人就帐前折箭为誓，永相救护。先主下诏使吴班为先锋，令张苞、关兴护驾。水陆并进，船骑双行，浩浩荡荡，杀奔吴国来。却说范疆、张达将张飞首级，投献吴侯，细告前事。孙权\n######################\nOutput:",
