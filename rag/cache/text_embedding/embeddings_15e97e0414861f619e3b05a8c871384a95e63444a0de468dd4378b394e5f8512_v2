represent them and that makes you an item of annoyance,” Leto said.\nNunepi had expected an open statement of hostility, but this was not the language of diplomacy, and it shocked him into a bold reference to what he believed to be Tleilaxu strength.\n“Lord, by preserving the flesh of the original Duncan Idaho and providing you with restored gholas in his image and identity, we have always assumed...”\n“Duncan!” Leto glanced at Idaho. “If | command it, Duncan, will you lead an expedition to exterminate the Tleilaxu?”\n“With pleasure, m’Lord.”\n“Even if it means the loss of your original cells and all of the axlotl tanks?”\n“I do not find the tanks a pleasant memory, m’lord, and those cells are not me.”\n“Lord, how have we offended you?” Nunepi asked.\nLeto scowled. Did this inept fool really expect the God Emperor to speak openly of the recent Face Dancer attack?\n“It has come to my attention,” Leto said, “that you and your people have been spreading lies about what you call my ‘disgusting sexual habits.’”\nNunepi gaped. The accusation was a bold lie, completely unexpected. But Nunepi realized that if he denied it, no one would believe him. The God Emperor had said it. This was an attack of unknown dimensions. Nunepi started to speak while looking at Idaho.\n“Lord, if we...”\n“Look at me!” Leto commanded.\nNunepi jerked his gaze up to Leto’s face.\n“I will inform you only this once,” Leto said. “I have no sexual habits whatsoever. None.”\nPerspiration rolled off Nunepi’s face. He stared at Leto with the fixed intensity of a trapped animal. When Nunepi found his voice, it no longer was the low, controlled instrument of a diplomat, but a trembling and fearful thing.\n“Lord, |... there must be a mistake of...”\n“Be still, you Tleilaxu sneak!” Leto roared. Then: “I am a metamorphic vector of the holy sandworm— Shai-Hulud! | am your God!”\n“Forgive us, Lord,” Nunepi whispered.\n“Forgive you?” Leto’s voice was full of sweet reason. “Of course | forgive you. That is your God’s function. Your crime is forgiven. However, your stupidity requires a response.”\n“Lord, if | could but...”\n“Be still! The spice allotment passes over the Tleilaxu for this decade. You get nothing. As for you personally, my Fish Speakers will now take you into the plaza.”\nTwo burly guardswomen moved in and held Nunepi’s arms. They looked up to Leto for instructions.\n“In the plaza,” Leto said, “his clothing is to be stripped from him. He is to be publicly flogged—fifty lashes.”\nNunepi struggled against the grip of his guards, consternation on his face mingled with rage.\n“Lord, | remind you that | am the Ambassador of...”\n“You are a common criminal and will be treated as such.” Leto nodded to the guards, who began dragging Nunepi away.\n“I wish they’d killed you!” Nunepi raged. “I wish...”\n“Who?” Leto called. “You wish who had killed me? Don’t you know I cannot be killed?”\nThe guards dragged Nunepi out of the chamber as he still raged: “I am innocent! | am innocent!” The protest faded away.\nIdaho leaned close to Leto.\n“Yes, Duncan?” Leto asked.\n“M’Lord, all the envoys will feel fear at this.”\n“Yes. | teach a lesson in responsibility.”\n“M’Lord?”\n“Membership in a conspiracy, as in an army, frees people from the sense of personal responsibility.”\n“But this will cause trouble, m’Lord. I’d best post extra guards.”\n“Not one additional guard!”\n“But you invite...”\n“I invite a bit of military nonsense.”\n“That’s what !l.. .”\n“Duncan, | am a teacher. Remember that. By repetition, | impress the lesson.”\n“What lesson?”\n“The ultimately suicidal nature of military foolishness.”\n“M’Lord, | don’t...”\n“Duncan, consider the inept Nunepi. He is the essence of this lesson.”\n“Forgive my denseness, m’Lord, but | do not understand this thing about military...”\n“They believe that by risking death they pay the price of any violent behavior against enemies of their own choosing. They have the invader mentality. Nunepi does not believe himself responsible for anything done against a/iens.”\nIdaho looked at the portal where the guards had taken Nunepi. “He tried and he lost, m’Lord.”\n“But he cut himself loose from the restraints of the past and he objects to paying the price.”\n“To his people, he’s a patriot.”\n“And how does he see himself, Duncan? As an instrument of history.”\nIdaho lowered his voice and leaned closer to Leto.\n“How are you different, m’Lord?”\nLeto chuckled. “Ahhh, Duncan, how | love your perceptiveness. You have observed that | am the ultimate alien. Do you not wonder if | also can be a loser?”\n“The thought has crossed my mind.”\n“Even losers can shroud themselves in the proud mantle of ‘the past,’ old friend.”\n“Are you and Nunepi alike in that?”\n“Militant missionary religions can share this illusion of the ‘proud past,’ but few understand the ultimate peril to humankind—that false sense of freedom from responsibility for your own actions.”\n“These are strange words, m’Lord. How do | take their meaning?”\n“Their meaning is whatever speaks to you. Are you incapable of listening?”\n“| have ears, m’Lord!”\n“Do you now? | cannot see them.”\n“Here, m’lord. Here and here!” Idaho pointed at his own ears as he spoke.\n“But they do not hear. Therefore you have no ears, neither here nor hear.”\n“You make a joke of me, m’Lord?”\n“To hear is to hear. That which exists cannot be made into itself for it already exists. To be is to be.”\n“Your strange words...”\n“Are but words. | spoke them. They are gone. No one heard them, therefore they no longer exist. If they no longer\nexist, perhaps they can be made to exist again and then perhaps someone will hear them.”\n“Why do you poke fun at me, m’Lord?”\n“| poke nothing at you except words. | do it without fear of offending because | have learned that you have no ears.”\n“| don’t understand you, m’Lord.”\n“That is the beginning of knowledge—the discovery of something we do not understand.”\nBefore Idaho could respond, Leto gave a hand signal to a nearby guard who waved a hand in front of a crystalline control panel on the wall behind the God Emperor’s dais. A three-dimensional view of Nunepi’s punishment appeared in the center of the chamber.\nIdaho stepped down to the floor of the chamber and peered closely at the scene. It was shown from a slight elevation looking down on the plaza, and was complete with sounds of the swelling throng who had run to the scene at the first signs of excitement.\nNunepi was bound to two legs of a tripod, his feet spread wide, his arms tied together above him almost at the apex of the tripod. His clothing had been ripped from his body and lay around him in rags. A bulky, masked Fish Speaker stood nearby holding an improvised whip fashioned of elacca rope which had been frayed at the end into wirelike fine strands. Idaho thought he recognized the masked woman as the Friend of his first interview.\nAt a signal from a Guard officer, the masked Fish Speaker stepped forward and brought the elacca whip down ina Slashing arc onto Nunepi’s exposed back.\nIdaho winced. The crowd gasped.\nWelts appeared where the whip had struck, but Nunepi remained silent.\nAgain, the whip descended. Blood betrayed the lines of this second stroke.\nOnce more, the whip flayed Nunepi’s back. More blood appeared.\nLeto felt remote sadness. Nayla is too ardent, he thought. She will kill him and that will cause problems.\n“Duncan!” Leto called.\nIdaho turned from his fascinated examination of the projected scene just as a shout lifted from the crowd— response to a particularly bloody stroke.\n“Send someone to stop the flogging after twenty lashes,” Leto said. “Have it announced that the magnanimity of the God Emperor has reduced the punishment.”\nIdaho raised a hand to one of the guards, who nodded and ran from the chamber.\n“Come here, Duncan,” Leto said.\nStill smarting under what he believed was Leto’s poking fun at him, Idaho returned to Leto’s side.\n“Whatever | do,” Leto said, “it is to teach a lesson.”\nIdaho rigidly willed himself not to look back at the scene of Nunepi’s punishment. Was that the sound of Nunepi groaning? The shouts of the crowd pierced Idaho. He stared up into Leto’s eyes.\n“There is a question in your mind,” Leto said.\n“Many questions, m’Lord.”\n“Speak them.”\n“What is the lesson in that fool’s punishment? What do we say when asked?”\n“We say that no one is permitted to blaspheme against the God Emperor.”\n“A bloody lesson, m’'Lord.”\n“Not as bloody as some I’ve taught.”\nIdaho shook his head from side to side in obvious dismay. “Nothing good’s going to come of this!”\n“Precisely!”\nSafaris through ancestral memories teach me many things. The patterns, ahhh, the patterns. Liberal bigots are the ones who trouble me most. | distrust the extremes. Scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefers the past over any future. Scratch a liberal and find a closet aristocrat. It’s true! Liberal governments always develop into aristocracies. The bureaucracies betray the true intent of people who form such governments. Right from the first, the //ttle people who formed the governments which promised to equalize the social burdens found themselves suddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies. Of course, all bureaucracies follow this pattern, but what a hypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner. Ahhh, well, if patterns teach me anything it’s that patterns are repeated. My oppressions, by and large, are no worse than any of the others and, at least, | teach a new lesson.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nt was well into the darkness of Audience Day before Leto could meet with the Bene Gesserit delegation. Moneo had prepared the Reverend Mothers for the delay, repeating the God Emperor’s reassurances. Reporting back to his Emperor, Moneo had said: “They expect a rich reward.” “We shall see,” Leto had said. “We shall see. Now, tell me what it was the Duncan demanded of you as you entered.” “He wished to know if you had ever before had someone flogged.” “And you replied?” “That there was no record of, nor had | ever before witnessed, such a punishment.” “His response?” “This is not Atreides.” “Does he think I’m insane?” “He did not say that.”\n“There was more to your encounter. What else troubles our new Duncan?”\n“He has met the Ixian Ambassador, Lord. He finds Hwi Noree attractive. He inquired of...”\n“That must be prevented, Moneo!", " before Leto could meet with the Bene Gesserit delegation.

He inquired of...”\n“That must be prevented, Moneo! | trust you to raise barriers against any liaison between the Duncan and Hwi.”\n“My Lord commands.”\n“Indeed | do! Go now and prepare for our meeting with the women of the Bene Gesserit. | will receive them at False Sietch.”\n“Lord, is there significance in this choice of a meeting place?”\n“A whim. On your way out, tell the Duncan he may take out a troop of guards and scour the City for trouble.”\nWaiting for the Bene Gesserit delegation at False Sietch, Leto reviewed this exchange, finding some amusement in it. He could imagine the reactions through the Festival City at the approach of a disturbed Duncan Idaho in command of a Fish Speaker troop.\nLike the quick silence of frogs when a predator comes.\nNow that he was in False Sietch, Leto found himself pleased by the choice. A free-form building of irregular domes at the edge of Onn, False Sietch was almost a kilometer across. It had been the first abode of the Museum Fremen and now was their school, its corridors and chambers patrolled by alert Fish Speakers.\nThe reception hall where Leto waited, an oval about two hundred meters in its long dimension, was illuminated by giant glowglobes which floated in blue-green isolation some thirty meters above the floor. The light muted the dull browns and tans of the imitation stone from which the entire structure had been fashioned. Leto waited on a low ledge at one end of the chamber, looking outward through a half- circle window longer than his body. The opening, four stories above the ground, framed a view which included a remnant of the ancient Shield Wall preserved for its cliffside caves\nwhere Atreides troops had once been slaughtered by Harkonnen attackers. The frosty light of First Moon silvered the cliff’s outlines. Fires dotted the cliffside, the flames exposed where no Fremen would have dared betray his presence. The fires winked at Leto as people passed in front of them—Museum Fremen exercising their right to occupy the sacred precincts.\nMuseum Fremen! Leto thought.\nThey were such narrow thinkers with near horizons.\nBut why should | object? They are what I made them.\nLeto heard the Bene Gesserit delegation then. They chanted as they approached, a heavy sound all a-jostle with vowels.\nMoneo preceded them with a guard detail which took up position on Leto’s ledge. Moneo stood on the chamber floor just below Leto’s face, glanced at Leto, turned to the open hall.\nThe women entered in a double file, ten of them led by two Reverend Mothers in traditional black robes.\n“That is Anteac on the left, Luyseyal on the right,” Moneo said.\nThe names recalled for Leto the earlier words about the Reverend Mothers brought in by Moneo, agitated and distrustful. Moneo did not like the witches.\n“They're both Truthsayers,” Moneo had said. “Anteac is much older than Luyseyal, but the latter is reputed to be the best Truthsayer the Bene Gesserit have. You may note that Anteac has a scar on her forehead whose origin we have been unable to discover. Luyseyal has red hair and appears remarkably young for one of her reputation.”\nAs he watched the Reverend Mothers approach with their entourage, Leto felt the quick surge of his memories. The women wore their hoods forward, shrouding their faces. The attendants and acolytes walked at a respectful distance behind... it was all of a piece. Some patterns did not\nchange. These women might have been entering a real sietch with real Fremen here to honor them.\nTheir heads know what their bodies deny, he thought.\nLeto’s penetrating vision saw the subservient caution in their eyes, but they strode up the long chamber like people confident of their religious power.\nIt pleased Leto to think that the Bene Gesserit possessed only such powers as he permitted. The reasons for this indulgence were clear to him. Of all the people in his Empire, Reverend Mothers were most like him—limited to the memories of only their female ancestors and the collateral female identities of their inheritance ritual—still, each of them did exist as somewhat of an integrated mob.\nThe Reverend Mothers came to a stop at the required ten paces from Leto’s ledge. The entourage spread out on each side.\nIt amused Leto to greet such delegations in the voice and persona of his grandmother, Jessica. The Bene Gesserit had come to expect this and he did not disappoint them.\n“Welcome, Sisters,” he said. The voice was a smooth contralto, definitely Jessica’s controlled feminine tones with just a hint of mockery—a voice recorded and often studied in the Sisterhood’s Chapter House.\nAs he spoke, Leto sensed menace. Reverend Mothers were never pleased when he greeted them this way, but the reaction here carried different undertones. Moneo, too, sensed it. He raised a finger and the guards moved closer to Leto.\nAnteac spoke first: “Lord, we watched that display in the plaza this morning. What do you gain by such antics?”\nSo that’s the tone we wish to set, he thought.\nSpeaking in his own voice, he said: “You are temporarily in my good graces. Would you change that?”\n“Lord,” Anteac said, “we are shocked that you could thus punish an Ambassador. We do not understand what you gain by this.”\n“I gain nothing. | am diminished.”\nLuyseyal spoke up: “This can only reinforce thoughts of oppression.”\n“I wonder why so few ever thought of the Bene Gesserit as oppressors?” Leto asked.\nAnteac spoke to her companion: “If it pleases the God Emperor to inform us, he will do so. Let us get to the purposes of our Embassy.”\nLeto smiled. “The two of you can come closer. Leave your attendants and approach.”\nMoneo stepped two paces to his right as the Reverend Mothers moved in characteristic silent gliding to within three paces of the ledge.\n“It’s almost as though they had no feet!” Moneo had once complained.\nRecalling this, Leto observed how carefully Moneo watched the two women. They were menacing, but Moneo dared not object to their nearness. The God Emperor had ordered it; thus it would be.\nLeto lifted his attention to the attendants waiting where the Bene Gesserit entourage had first stopped. The acolytes wore hoodless black gowns. He saw tiny clues to forbidden rituals about them—an amulet, a small trinket, a colorful corner of a kerchief so arranged that more color might be flashed carefully. Leto knew that the Reverend Mothers allowed this because they no longer could share the spice as once they had.\nRitual substitutes.\nThere were significant changes across the past ten years. A new parsimony had entered the Sisterhood’s thinking.\nThey are coming out, Leto told himself. The old, old mysteries are still here.\nThe ancient patterns had lain dormant in the Bene Gesserit memories for all of those millennia.\nNow, they emerge. | must warn my Fish Speakers.\nHe returned his attention to the Reverend Mothers.\n“You have requests?”\n“What is it like to be you?” Luyseyal asked.\nLeto blinked. That was an interesting attack. They had not tried it in more than a generation. Well... why not?\n“Sometimes my dreams are blocked off and redirected into strange places,” he said. “If my cosmic memories are a web, as you two certainly know, then think about the dimensions of my web and where such memories and dreams might lead.”\n“You speak of our certain knowledge,” Anteac said. “Why can’t we join forces at last? We are more alike than we are different.”\n“I would sooner link myself to those degenerate Great Houses bewailing their lost spice riches!”\nAnteac held herself still, but Luyseyal pointed a finger at Leto. “We offer community!”\n“And | insist on conflict?”\nAnteac stirred, then: “It is said that there is a principle of conflict which originated with the single cell and has never deteriorated.”\n“Some things remain incompatible,” Leto agreed.\n“Then how does our Sisterhood maintain its community?” Luyseyal demanded.\nLeto hardened his voice. “As you well know, the secret of community lies in suppression of the incompatible.”\n“There can be enormous value in cooperation,” Anteac said.\n“To you, not to me.”\nAnteac contrived a sigh. “Then, Lord, will you tell us about the physical changes in your person?”\n“Someone besides yourself should know about and record such things,” Luyseyal said.\n“In case something dreadful should happen to me?” Leto asked.\n“Lord!” Anteac protested. “We do not...”\n“You dissect me with words when you would prefer Sharper instruments,” Leto said. “Hypocrisy offends me.”\n“We protest, Lord,” Anteac said.\n“Indeed you do. | hear you.”\nLuyseyal crept a few millimeters closer to the ledge, bringing a sharp stare from Moneo, who glanced up at Leto then. Moneo’s expression demanded action, but Leto ignored him, curious now about Luyseyal’s intentions. The sense of menace was centered in the red-haired one.\nWhat is she? Leto wondered. Could she be a Face Dancer, after all?\nNo. None of the telltale signs were there. No. Luyseyal presented an elaborately relaxed appearance, not even a little twist of her features to test the God Emperor’s powers of observation.\n“Will you not tell us about your physical changes, Lord?” Anteac asked.\nDiversion! Leto thought.\n“My brain grows enormous,” he said. “Most of the human skull has dissolved away. There are no severe limits to the growth of my cortex and its attendant nervous system.”\nMoneo darted a startled glance at Leto. Why was the God Emperor giving away such vital information? These two would trade it.\nBut both women were obviously fascinated by this revelation, hesitating in whatever plan they had evolved.\n“Does your brain have a center?” Luyseyal asked.\n“Lam the center,” Leto said.\n“A location?” Anteac asked. She gestured vaguely at him. Luyseyal glided a few millimeters closer to the ledge.\n“What value do you place on the things | reveal to you?” Leto asked.\nThe two women betrayed no change of expression, which was betrayal enough by itself. A smile flitted across Leto’s lips.\n“The marketplace has captured you,” he said. “Even the Bene Gesserit has been infected by the suk mentality.”\n“We do not deserve that accusation,” Anteac said.\n“But you do. The suk mentality dominates my Empire. The uses of", " its attendant nervous system.”\nMoneo darted a startled glance at Leto. Why was the God Emperor giving away such vital information?

The suk mentality dominates my Empire. The uses of the market have only been sharpened and amplified by the demands of our times. We have all become traders.”\n“Even you, Lord?” Luyseyal asked.\n“You tempt my wrath,” he said. “You’re a specialist in that, aren’t you?”\n“Lord?” Luyseyal’s voice was calm, but overly controlled.\n“Specialists are not to be trusted,” Leto said. “Specialists are masters of exclusion, experts in the narrow.”\n“We hope to be architects of a better future,” Anteac said.\n“Better than what?” Leto asked.\nLuyseyal eased herself a fractional pace closer to Leto.\n“We hope to set our standards by your judgment, Lord,” Anteac said.\n“But you would be architects. Would you build higher walls? Never forget, Sisters, that | know you. You are efficient purveyors of blinders.”\n“Life continues, Lord,” Anteac said.\n“Indeed! And so does the universe.”\nLuyseyal eased herself a bit closer, ignoring the fixity of Moneo’s attention.\nLeto smelled it then and almost laughed aloud.\nSpice-essence!\nThey had brought some spice-essence. They knew the old stories about sandworms and spice-essence, of course. Luyseyal carried it. She thought of it as a specific poison for sSandworms. That was obvious. Bene Gesserit records and the Oral History agreed on this. The essence shattered the worm, precipitating its dissolution and resulting (eventually) in sandtrout which would produce more sandworms— etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...\n“There is another change in me that you should know about,” Leto said. “I am not yet sandworm, not fully. Think of me as something closer to a colony creature with sensory alterations.”\nLuyseyal’s left hand moved almost imperceptibly toward a fold in her gown. Moneo saw it and looked to Leto for instructions, but Leto only returned the hooded glare of Luyseyal’s eyes.\n“There have been fads in smells,” Leto said.\nLuyseyal’s hand hesitated.\n“Perfumes and essences,” he said. “I remember them all, even the cults of the non-smells are mine. People have used underarm sprays and crotch sprays to mask their natural odors. Did you know that? Of course you knew it!”\nAnteac’s gaze moved toward Luyseyal.\nNeither woman dared speak.\n“People knew instinctively that their pheromones betrayed them,” Leto said.\nThe women stood immobile. They heard him. Of all his people, Reverend Mothers were best equipped to understand his hidden message.\n“You'd like to mine me for my riches of memory,” Leto said, his voice accusing.\n“We are jealous, Lord,” Luyseyal confessed.\n“You have misread the history of spice-essence,” Leto said. “Sandtrout sense it only as water.”\n“It was a test, Lord,” Anteac said. “That is all.”\n“You would test me?”\n“Blame our curiosity, Lord,” Anteac said.\n“|, too, am curious. Put your spice-essence on the ledge beside Moneo. | will keep it.”\nSlowly, demonstrating by the steadiness of her movements that she intended no attack, Luyseyal reached beneath her gown and removed a small vial which glistened with an inner blue radiance. She placed the vial gently on\nthe ledge. Not by any sign did she indicate that she might try something desperate.\n“Truthsayer, indeed,” Leto said.\nShe favored him with a faint grimace which might have been a smile, then withdrew to Anteac’s side.\n“Where did you get the spice-essence?” Leto asked.\n“We bought it from smugglers,” Anteac said.\n“There’ve been no smugglers for almost twenty-five hundred years.”\n“Waste not, want not,” Anteac said.\n“I see. And now you must reevaluate what you think of as your own patience, is that not so?”\n“We have been watching the evolution of your body, Lord,” Anteac said. “We thought...” She permitted herself a small shrug, the level of gesture warranted for use with a Sister and not given lightly.\nLeto pursed his lips in response. “I cannot shrug,” he said.\n“Will you punish us?” Luyseyal asked.\n“For amusing me?”\nLuyseyal glanced at the vial on the ledge.\n“| swore to reward you,” Leto said. “I shall.”\n“We would prefer to protect you in our community, Lord,” Anteac said.\n“Do not seek too great a reward,” he said.\nAnteac nodded. “You deal with the Ixians, Lord. We have reason to believe they may venture against you.”\n“| fear them no more than | fear you.”\n“Surely you’ve heard what the Ixians are doing,” Luyseyal said.\n“Moneo brings me an occasional copy of a message between persons or groups in my Empire. | hear many stories.”\n“We speak of a new Abomination, Lord!” Anteac said.\n“You think the Ixians can produce an artificial intelligence?” he asked. “Conscious the way you are conscious?”\n“We fear it, Lord,” Anteac said.\n“You would have me believe that the Butlerian Jihad Survives among the Sisterhood?”\n“We do not trust the unknown which can arise from imaginative technology,” Anteac said.\nLuyseyal leaned toward him. “The Ixians boast that their machine will transcend Time in the way that you do it, Lord.”\n“And the Guild says there’s Time-chaos around the Ixians,” Leto mocked. “Are we to fear all creation, then?”\nAnteac drew herself up stiffly.\n“| speak truth with you two,” Leto said. “I recognize your abilities. Will you not recognize mine?”\nLuyseyal gave him a curt nod. “Tleilax and Ix make alliance with the Guild and seek our full cooperation.”\n“And you fear Ix the most?”\n“We fear anything we do not control,” Anteac said.\n“And you do not control me.”\n“Without you, people would need us!” Anteac said.\n“Truth at last!” Leto said. “You come to me as your Oracle and you ask me to put your fears to rest.”\nAnteac’s voice was frigidly controlled. “Will Ix make a mechanical brain?”\n“A brain? Of course not!”\nLuyseyal appeared to relax, but Anteac remained unmoving. She was not satisfied with the Oracle.\nWhy is it that foolishness repeats itself with such monotonous precision? Leto wondered. His memories offered up countless scenes to match this one—caverns, priests and priestesses caught up in holy ecstasy, portentous voices delivering dangerous prophecies through the smoke of holy narcotics.\nHe glanced down at the iridescent vial on the ledge beside Moneo. What was the current value of that thing? Enormous. It was the essence. Concentrated wealth concentrated.\n“You have already paid the Oracle,” he said. “It amuses me to give you full value.”\nHow alert the women became!\n“Hear me!” he said. “What you fear is not what you fear.”\nLeto liked the sound of that. Sufficiently portentous for any Oracle. Anteac and Luyseyal stared up at him, dutiful Supplicants. Behind them, an acolyte cleared her throat.\nThat one will be identified and reprimanded later, Leto thought.\nAnteac had now had sufficient time to ruminate on Leto’s words. She said: “An obscure truth is not the truth.”\n“But | have directed your attention correctly,” Leto said.\n“Are you telling us not to fear the machine?” Luyseyal asked.\n“You have the power of reason,” he said. “Why come begging to me?”\n“But we do not have your powers,” Anteac said.\n“You complain then that you do not sense the gossamer waves of Time. You do not sense my continuum. And you fear a mere machine!”\n“Then you will not answer us,” Anteac said.\n“Do not make the mistake of thinking me ignorant about your Sisterhood’s ways,” he said. “You are alive. Your senses are exquisitely tuned. | do not stop this, nor should you.”\n“But the Ixians play with automation!” Anteac protested.\n“Discrete pieces, finite bits linked one to another,” he agreed. “Once set in motion, what is to stop it?”\nLuyseyal discarded all pretense of Bene Gesserit self- control, a fine comment on her recognition of Leto’s powers. Her voice almost screeched: “Do you know what the Ixians boast? That their machine will predict your actions!”\n“Why should | fear that? The closer they come to me, the more they must be my allies. They cannot conquer me, but | can conquer them.”\nAnteac made to speak but stopped when Luyseyal touched her arm.\n“Are you already allied with Ix?” Luyseyal asked. “We hear that you conferred overlong with their new Ambassador, this Hwi Noree.”\n“I have no allies,” he said. “Only servants, students and enemies.”\n“And you do not fear the Ixians’ machine?” Anteac insisted.\n“Is automation synonymous with conscious intelligence?” he asked.\nAnteac’s eyes went wide and filmy as she withdrew into her memories. Leto found himself caught by fascination with what she must be encountering there within her own internal mob.\nWe share some of those memories, he thought.\nLeto felt then the seductive attraction of community with Reverend Mothers. It would be so familiar, so Supportive... and so deadly. Anteac was trying to lure him once more.\nShe spoke: “The machine cannot anticipate every problem of importance to humans. It is the difference between serial bits and an unbroken continuum. We have the one; machines are confined to the other.”\n“You still have the power of reason,” he said.\n“Share!” Luyseyal said. It was a command to Anteac and it revealed with sharp abruptness who really dominated this pair—the younger over the older.\nExquisite, Leto thought.\n“Intelligence adapts,” Anteac said.\nParsimonious with her words, too, Leto thought, hiding his amusement.\n“Intelligence creates,” Leto said. “That means you must deal with responses never before imagined. You must confront the new.”\n“Such as the possibility of the Ixian Machine,” Anteac said.
