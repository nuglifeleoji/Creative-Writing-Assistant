   于是操引大军前抵冀州。曹洪已近城下。操令三军绕城筑起土山，又暗掘地道以攻之。审配设计坚守，法令甚严，东门守将冯礼，因酒醉有误巡警，配痛责之。冯礼怀恨，潜地出城降操。操问破城之策，礼曰：“突门内土厚，可掘地道而入。”操便命冯礼引三百壮士，夤夜掘地道而入。却说审配自冯礼出降之后，每夜亲自登城点视军马。当夜在突门阁上，望见城外无灯火。配曰：“冯礼必引兵从地道而入也。”急唤精兵运石击突闸门；门闭，冯礼及三百壮士，皆死于土内。操折了这一场，遂罢地道之计，退军于洹水之上，以候袁尚回兵。袁尚攻平原，闻曹操已破尹楷、沮鹄，大军围困冀州，乃掣兵回救。部将马延曰：“从大路去，曹操必有伏兵；可取小路，从西山出滏水口去劫曹营，必解围也。”尚从其言，自领大军先行，令马延与张顗断后。早有细作去报曹操。操曰：“彼若从大路上来，吾当避之：若从西山小路而来，一战可擒也。吾料袁尚必举火为号，令城中接应。吾可分兵击之。”于是分拨已定。却说袁尚出滏水界口，东至阳平，屯军阳平亭，离冀州十七里，一边靠着滏水。尚令军士堆积柴薪干草，至夜焚烧为号；遣主簿李孚扮作曹军都督，直至城下。大叫：“开门！”审配认得是李孚声音，放入城中，说：“袁尚已陈兵在阳平亭，等候接应，若城中兵出，亦举火为号。”配教城中堆草放火，以通音信。孚曰：“城中无粮，可发老弱残兵并妇人出降；彼必不为备，我即以兵继百姓之后出攻之。”配从其论。\n\n
