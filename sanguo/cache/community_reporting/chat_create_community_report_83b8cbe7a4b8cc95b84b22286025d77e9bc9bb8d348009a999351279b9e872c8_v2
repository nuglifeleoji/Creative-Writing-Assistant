He was well-versed in military strategy and played a crucial role in various military campaigns against the rival state of Wu. As a high-ranking official, Sima Zhao harbored ambitions of usurping power, engaging in political machinations that significantly influenced the political landscape of Wei.\n\nSima Zhao commanded the Wei forces during critical conflicts, including the siege of Dongxing, where he was involved in military strategies against Wu. He was known for his ruthless tactics against enemies and captives, which earned him a reputation as a formidable military leader. His strategic decisions were pivotal in directing troops to defend against Wu and in orchestrating military operations, including the attack on Shouchun and planning support for the general Deng Ai.\n\nIn addition to his military prowess, Sima Zhao was a powerful political figure who returned to court to negotiate with the Wei emperor, known as 后主. He was instrumental in the political upheaval that led to the assassination of Emperor Cao Mao, subsequently establishing Cao Huan as the new emperor. This act was part of his broader ambition to consolidate power within the Wei state.\n\nSima Zhao succeeded his brother Sima Shi and continued to build upon the political and military legacy of his family. His influence extended beyond the battlefield, as he was involved in governance and the distribution of rewards to military leaders like Deng Ai. His actions and decisions during this tumultuous period were critical in shaping the future of the Wei dynasty, marking him as a key figure in the historical narrative of the Three Kingdoms. \n\nOverall, Sima Zhao's legacy is characterized by his dual role as a military commander and a political strategist, whose ambitions and actions had lasting impacts on the Wei state and its interactions with rival powers.\",36\n3198,吕岱,\"吕岱 was a high-ranking general in Wei, called to the bedside of Sun Quan to discuss future matters before his death.\",1\n3375,晋公,\"晋公 refers to the title that 司马昭 and his family aspired to achieve, indicating their desire for power.\",1\n3491,司马攸,\"司马攸 is the younger son of司马昭, known for his gentle and respectful nature.\",1\n3492,酒宴,酒宴 is the banquet set by司马昭 to welcome后主 and discuss matters.,1\n3323,文虎,\"文虎 is a prominent general in the Wu army, recognized for his significant role in military actions against the Wei army.

Together, they share a strong commitment to protecting their family and upholding their honor in the face of conflict. This familial bond underscores their dedication to their cause and highlights the importance of loyalty and honor in their lives as warriors.\n\n文虎's contributions to the Wu army and his relationship with his brother reflect the values of bravery and duty that are central to their identities as generals in a tumultuous period of warfare.\",2\n112,武士,\"The term \"\"武士\"\" (bushi) refers to soldiers or guards who played a crucial role in enforcing the emperor's orders and protecting the imperial court.
