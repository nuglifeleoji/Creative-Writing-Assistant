Originally a legendary swordsman and trusted officer of the Atreides House Troop, he sacrificed his life to protect Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica during the Harkonnen attack. His genetic material was later used by the Bene Tleilax to create gholas (clones), making him a central figure in the machinations of both the Tleilaxu and the Bene Gesserit.  \\n\\nAs a ghola, Duncan has been resurrected numerous times, often with restored or fragmented memories of his past lives. He serves as a Mentat, a skilled combat instructor, and a military commander, contributing to strategic and political decisions. Under Leto II’s reign as the God Emperor, he becomes a key figure in the empire, acting as a confidant, Royal Guard commander, and reluctant participant in Leto’s breeding programs—particularly as the intended mate of Siona Atreides. Despite his loyalty, he frequently questions Leto’s methods and harbors rebellious tendencies, reflecting his internal conflict between duty and personal skepticism.  \\n\\nDuncan’s relationships are equally intricate. He shares deep emotional ties with figures like Paul, Alia, and Hwi Noree, and later becomes entangled with Murbella and the Bene Gesserit’s schemes. His interactions with Sheeana hint at secretive alliances and potential defiance against the Sisterhood. Over successive resurrections, he evolves from a warrior bound by Atreides loyalty to a symbol of resistance and continuity, embodying both the old ways of humanity and Leto’s vision for the future.  \\n\\nHis significance extends beyond combat prowess; he is a psychological and genetic linchpin, valued by factions for his unique traits—whether as a \\\"jewel beyond price\\\" to House Corrino, a weapon against the Honored Matres, or a test subject for memory restoration.
