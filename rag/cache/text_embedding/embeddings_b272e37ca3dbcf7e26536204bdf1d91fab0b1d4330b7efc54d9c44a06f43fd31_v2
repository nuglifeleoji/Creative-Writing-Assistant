Crisis had tipped him over into another dimension of human possibilities. Whatever the transformation, it was profound. He could see outward now into many necessities. And the people he had passed on his run to this alley had seemed like statues.\nWill | ever think of them as muck?\nIt could only happen if he let it happen, he knew. But the temptation was there and he allowed himself a brief commiseration for the Honored Matres. Great Temptation had toppled them into their own muck.\nWhat to do now?\nThe main line lay open to him. There was a man here in Ysai, one man who would be sure to know everyone Teg required. Teg looked around the alley. Yes, that man was near.\nThe fragrance of flowers and herbs wafted to Teg from somewhere down this alley. He moved toward this fragrance, aware that it led him where he needed to go and that no violent attack awaited him here. This was, temporarily, a quiet backwater.\nHe came to the fragrant source quickly. It was an inset doorway marked by a blue awning with two words on it in modern Galach: “Personal Service.”\nTeg entered and saw immediately what he had found. They were to be seen at many places in the Old Empire: eating establishments harking back to ancient times, eschewing automata from kitchen to table. Most of them were “in” establishments. You told friends about your latest “discovery” with an admonition to them not to spread the word.\n“Don’t want to spoil it with crowding.”\nThis idea had always amused Teg. You spread the word about such places but you did it under the guise of keeping a secret.\nMouth-watering odors of cooking emerged from the kitchen at the rear. A waiter passed bearing a tray from which steam lifted, carrying the promise of good things.\nA young woman in a short black dress with a white apron came up to him. “This way, sir. We have a table open in the corner.”\nShe held a chair for him to be seated with his back to the wall. “Someone will be with you in a moment, sir.” She passed him a stiff sheet of cheap double-thickness paper. “Our menu is printed. | hope you won’t mind.”\nHe watched her leave. The waiter he had seen passed going the other way toward the kitchen. The tray was empty.\nTeg’s feet had led him here as though he had been running on a fixed track. And there was the man he required, dining nearby.\nThe waiter had stopped to talk to the man Teg knew held the answer to the next moves required here. The two were laughing together. Teg scanned the rest of the room: only three other tables occupied. An older woman sat at a table in the far corner nibbling at some frosty confection. She was dressed in what Teg thought must be the peak of current\nfashion, a clinging short red gown cut low at the neck. Her shoes matched. A young couple sat at a table off to his right. They saw no one except each other. An older man ina tightly fitted old-fashioned brown tunic ate sparingly of a green vegetable dish near the door. He had eyes only for his food.\nThe man talking to the waiter laughed loudly.\nTeg stared at the back of the waiter’s head. Tufts of blond hair sorang from the nape of the waiter’s neck like broken bunches of dead grass. The man’s collar was frayed beneath the tufted hair. Teg lowered his gaze. The waiter’s shoes were run over at the heels. The hem of his black jacket had been darned. Was it thrift in this place? Thrift or some other form of economic pressure? The odors from the kitchen did not suggest any stinting there. The tableware was shining and clean. No cracked dishes. But the striped red and white cloth on the table had been darned in several places, care taken to match the original fabric.\nOnce more, Teg studied the other customers. They looked substantial. None of the starving poor in this place. Teg had it registered then. Not only was this an “in” place, somebody had designed it for just that effect. There was a clever mind behind such an establishment. This was the kind of restaurant that rising young executives revealed to make points with prospective customers or to please a superior. The food would be superb and the portions generous. Teg realized that his instincts had led him here correctly. He bent his attention to the menu then, allowing hunger to enter his consciousness at last. The hunger was at least as fierce as that which had astonished the late Field Marshal Muzzafar.\nThe waiter appeared beside him with a tray on which were placed a small open box and a jar from which wafted the pungent odor of newskin ointment.\n“I see you have injured your hand, Bashar,” the man said. He placed the tray on the table. “Allow me to dress the injury before you order.”\nTeg lifted the injured hand and watched the swift competence of the treatment.\n“You know me?” Teg asked.\n“Yes, sir. And after what I’ve been hearing, it seems strange to see you in full uniform. There.” He finished the dressing.\n“What have you been hearing?” Teg spoke in a low voice.\n“That the Honored Matres hunt you.”\n“lve just killed some of them and many of their... What should we call them?”\nThe man paled but he spoke firmly. “Slaves would be a good word, sir.”\n“You were at Renditai, weren’t you,” Teg said.\n“Yes, sir. Many of us settled here afterward.”\n“| need food but | cannot pay you,” Teg said.\n“No one from Renditai has need of your money, Bashar. Do they know you came this way?”\n“I don’t believe they do.”\n“The people here now are regulars. None of them would betray you. | will try to warn you if someone dangerous comes. What did you wish to eat?”\n“A great deal of food. | will leave the choice to you. About twice as much carbohydrate as protein. No stimulants.”\n“What do you mean by a great deal, sir?”\n“Keep bringing it until | tell you to stop... or until you feel | have overstepped your generosity.”\n“In spite of appearances, sir, this is not a poor establishment. The extras here have made me a rich man.”\nScore one for his assessment, Teg thought. The thrift here was a calculated pose.\nThe waiter left and again spoke to the man at the central table. Teg studied the man openly after the waiter went on into the kitchen. Yes, that was the man. The diner concentrated on a plate heaped with some green-garnished pasta.\nThere was very little sign in this man of a woman’s care, Teg thought. His collar had been closed awry, the clingstraps tangled. Spots of the greenish sauce soiled his left cuff. He was naturally righthanded but ate while his left hand remained in the path of spillage. Frayed cuffs on his trousers. One trouser hem, partly released from its threaded bondage, dragged at the heel. Stockings mismatched—one blue and one pale yellow. None of this appeared to bother him. No mother or other woman had ever dragged this one back from a doorway with orders to make himself presentable. His basic attitude was announced in his whole appearance:\n“What you see is as presentable as it gets.”\nThe man looked up suddenly, a jerking motion as though he had been goosed. He sent a brown-eyed gaze around the room, pausing at each face in turn as though he looked for a particular visage. This done, he returned his attention to his plate.\nThe waiter returned with a clear soup in which shreds of egg and some green vegetables could be seen.\n“While the rest of your meal is being prepared, sir,” he said.\n“Did you come here directly after Renditai?” Teg asked.\n“Yes, sir. But | served with you also at Acline.”\n“The sixty-seventh Gammu,” Teg said.\n“Yes, sir!”\n“We saved a good many lives that time,” Teg said. “Theirs and ours.”\nWhen Teg still did not begin eating, the waiter spoke ina rather cold voice, “Would you require a snooper, sir?”\n“Not while you’re serving me,” Teg said. He meant what he said but he felt a bit of a fraud because doubled vision told him the food was safe.\nThe waiter started to turn away, pleased.\n“One moment,” Teg said.\n“Sir?”\n“The man at that central table. He is one of your regulars?”\n“Professor Delnay? Oh, yes, sir.”\n“Delnay. Yes, | thought so.”\n“Professor of martial arts, sir. And the history of same.”\n“I know. When it comes time to serve my dessert, please ask Professor Delnay if he would join me.”\n“Shall | tell him who you are, sir?”\n“Don’t you think he already knows?”\n“That would seem likely, sir, but still...”\n“Caution where caution belongs,” Teg said. “Bring on the food.”\nDelnay’s interest was fully aroused long before the waiter relayed Teg’s invitation. The professor’s first words as he seated himself across from Teg were: “That was the most remarkable gastronomic performance | have ever seen. Are you sure you Can eat a dessert?”\n“Two or three of them at least,” Teg said.\n“Astonishing!”\nTeg sampled a spoonful of a honey-sweetened confection. He swallowed it, then: “This place is a jewel.”\n“| have kept it a careful secret,” Delnay said. “Except for a few close friends, of course. To what do | owe the honor of your invitation?”\n“Have you ever been...ah, marked by an Honored Matre?”\n“Lords of perdition, no! I’m not important enough for that.”\n“I was hoping to ask you to risk your life, Delnay.”\n“In what way?” No hesitation. That was reassuring.\n“There is a place in Ysai where my old soldiers meet. | want to go there and see as many of them as possible.”\n“Through the streets in full regalia the way you are now?”\n“In any way you can arrange it.”\nDelnay put a finger to his lower lip and leaned back to stare at Teg. “You're not an easy figure to disguise, you\nknow. However, there may be a way.” He nodded thoughtfully. “Yes.” He smiled. “You won’t like it, I’m afraid.”\n“What do you have in mind?”\n“Some padding and other alterations. We will pass you off as a Bordano overseer. You'll smell of the sewer, of course. And you'll have to carry it off that you don’t notice.”\n“Why do you think that will succeed?” Teg asked.\n“Oh, there’s going to be a storm tonight. Regular thing this time of year. Laying down the moisture for next year’s open crops. And filling the reservoirs for the heated fields, you know.”\n“| don’t understand your reasoning, but when I’ve finished another of these confections, we'll go,” Teg said.\n“You'll like the place where we take refuge from the storm,” Delnay said. “I’m mad, you know, to do this. But the proprietor here said | was to help you or never come here again.”\nIt was an hour after dark when Delnay led him to the rendezvous point. Teg, dressed in leathers and affecting a limp, was forced to use much of his mental power to ignore his own odors. Delnay’s friends had plastered", " of course. And you'll have to carry it off that you don’t notice.”\n“Why do you think that will succeed?” Teg asked.\n“Oh, there’s going to be a storm tonight. Regular thing this time of year.

But the proprietor here said | was to help you or never come here again.”\nIt was an hour after dark when Delnay led him to the rendezvous point. Teg, dressed in leathers and affecting a limp, was forced to use much of his mental power to ignore his own odors. Delnay’s friends had plastered Teg with sewage and then hosed him off. The forced-air drying brought back most of the effluent aromas.\nA remote-reading weather station at the door of the meeting place told Teg it had dropped fifteen degrees outside in the preceding hour. Delnay preceded him and hurried away into a crowded room where there was much noise and the sound of clinking glassware. Teg paused to study the doorside station. The wind was gusting to thirty klicks, he saw. Barometric pressure down. He looked at the sign above the station:\n“A service to our customers.”\nPresumably, a service to the bar as well. Departing customers might well take one look at these readings and return to the warmth and camaraderie behind them.\nIn a large fireplace with inglenook at the far end of the bar there was a real fire burning. Aromatic wood.\nDelnay returned, wrinkled his nose at Teg’s smell and led him around the edge of the crowd into a back room, then through this into a private bathroom. Teg’s uniform— cleaned and pressed—was laid out over a chair there.\n“I'll be in the inglenook when you come out,” Delnay said.\n“In full regalia, eh?” Teg asked.\n“It’s only dangerous out in the streets,” Delnay said. He went back the way they had come.\nTeg emerged presently and found his way to the inglenook through groups that turned suddenly silent as people recognized him. Murmurous comments swept through the room. “The old Bashar himself.” “Oh, yes, it’s Teg. Served with him, | did. Know that face and figure anywhere.”\nCustomers had crowded into the atavistic warmth of the fireside. There was a rich smell of wet clothing and drink- fogged breaths there.\nSo the storm had driven this crowd into the bar? Teg looked at the battle-hardened military faces all around him, thinking that this was not a usual gathering, no matter what Delnay said. The people here knew one another, though, and had expected to meet one another here at this time.\nDelnay was sitting on one of the benches in the inglenook, a glass containing an amber drink in his hand.\n“You put out the word to meet us here,” Teg said.\n“Isn't that what you wanted, Bashar?”\n“Who are you, Delnay?”\n“I own a winter farm a few klicks south of here and | have some banker friends who will occasionally loan me a groundcar. If you want me to be more specific, I’m like the rest of the people in this room—someone who wants the Honored Matres off our necks.”\nA man behind Teg asked: “Is it true that you killed a hundred of them today, Bashar?”\nTeg spoke dryly without turning. “The number is greatly exaggerated. Could | have a drink, please?”\nFrom his greater height, Teg scanned the room while someone was getting him a glass. When it was thrust into his hand, it was, as he expected, the deep blue of Danian Marinete. These old soldiers knew his preferences.\nThe drinking activity in the room continued but at a more Subdued pace. They were waiting for him to state his purpose.\nGregarious human nature got a natural boost on such a stormy night, Teg thought. Band together behind the fire in the mouth of the cave, fellow tribesmen! Nothing dangerous will get past us, especially when the beasts see our fire. How many other similar gatherings were there around Gammu on such a night? he wondered, sipping his drink. Bad weather could mask movements that the gathered companions did not want observed. The weather might also keep certain people inside who were otherwise not Supposed to remain inside.\nHe recognized a few faces from his past—officers and ordinary soldiers—a mixed bag. For some of them, he had good memories: reliable people. Some of them would die tonight.\nThe noise level began to increase as people relaxed in his presence. No one pressed him for an explanation. They knew that about him, too. Teg set his own timetable.\nThe sounds of conversation and laughter were of a kind he knew must have accompanied such gatherings since the dawn times when humans clustered for mutual protection. Clinking of glassware, sudden bursts of laughter, a few quiet chuckles. Those would be the ones more conscious of their personal power. Quiet chuckles said you could be amused but you did not have to make a guffawing fool of yourself. Delnay was a quiet chuckler.\nTeg glanced up and saw that the beamed ceiling had been built conventionally low. It made the enclosed space\nseem at once more extended and yet more intimate. Careful attention to human psychology here. It was a thing he had observed many places on this planet. It was a care to keep a damper on unwanted awareness. Make them feel comfortable and secure. They were not, of course, but don’t let that get through to them.\nFor a few moments longer, Teg watched the drinks being distributed by the skilled waiting staff: dark local beers and some expensive imports. Scattered along the bar and on the softly illuminated tables were bowls containing crisp-fried local vegetables, heavily salted. Such an obvious move to heighten thirst apparently offended no one. It was merely expected in this trade. The beers would be heavily salted, too, of course. They always were. Brewers knew how to kick off the thirst response.\nSome of the groups were getting louder. The drinks had begun to work their ancient magic. Bacchus was here! Teg knew that if this gathering were allowed to run its natural course, the room would reach a crescendo later in the night and then gradually, very gradually, the noise level would subside. Someone would go look at the doorside weather station. Depending on what that one saw, the place might wind down immediately or continue at the more subdued pace for some time. He realized then that somewhere behind the bar there would be a way to distort the weather station’s readouts. This bar would not overlook such a way of extending its trade.\nGet ’em inside and keep ‘em here by any means they don’t find objectionable.\nThe people behind this institution would fall in with the Honored Matres and not blink an eye.\nTeg put his drink aside and called out: “May | have your attention, please?”\nSilence.\nEven the waiting staff stopped in what they were doing.\n“Some of you guard the doors,” Teg said. “No one goes in or out until | give the order. Those back doors, too, if you please.”\nWhen this had been sorted out, he stared carefully around the room, picking the ones his doubled vision and old military experience told him could be most trusted. What he had to do now had become quite plain to him. Burzmali, Lucilla, and Duncan were out there at the edge of his new vision, their needs easily seen.\n“| presume you can get your hands on weapons rather quickly,” he said.\n“We came prepared, Bashar!” Someone out in the room shouted. Teg heard the drink in that voice but also the old adrenaline pumping that would be so dear to these people.\n“We are going to capture a no-ship,” Teg said.\nThat grabbed them. No other artifact of civilization was as closely guarded. These ships came to the landing fields and other places and they left. Their armored surfaces bristled with weapons. Crews were on constant alert in vulnerable locations. Trickery might succeed; open assault stood little chance. But here in this room Teg had reached a new awareness, driven by necessity and the wild genes in his Atreides ancestry. The positions of the no-ships on and around Gammu were visible to him. Bright dots occupied his inner vision and, like threads leading from one bauble to another, his doubled vision saw the way through this maze.\nOh, but I do not want to go, he thought.\nThe thing driving him would not be denied.\n“Specifically, we are going to capture a no-ship from the Scattering,” he said. “They have some of the best. You, you and you and you.” He pointed, singling out individuals. “You will stay here and see that no one leaves or communicates with anyone outside of this establishment. | think you will be attacked. Hold out as long as you can. The rest of you, get your weapons and let’s go.”\nJustice? Who asks for justice. We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis—win or die. Let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them.\n—LETO I: BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nhe no-ship came in low over the Rakian sands. Its\npassage stirred up dusty whirlwinds that drifted around it as it settled in a crunching disturbance of the dunes. The silvered yellow sun was sinking into a horizon disturbed by the heat devils of a long hot day. The no-ship sat there creaking, a glistening steely ball whose presence could be detected by the eyes and ears but not by any prescient or long-range instrument. Teg’s doubled vision made him confident that no unwanted eyes saw his arrival.\n“I want the armored ‘thopters and cars out there in no more than ten minutes,” he said.\nPeople stirred into action behind him.\n“Are you certain they’re here, Bashar?” The voice was that of a drinking companion from the Gammu bar, a trusted officer from Renditai whose mood no longer was that of someone recapturing the thrills of his youth. This one had seen old friends die in the battle on Gammu. As with most of the others who survived to come here, he had left a family whose fate he did not know. There was a touch of bitterness in his voice, as though he were trying to convince himself that he had been tricked into this venture.\n“They will be here soon,” Teg said. “They will arrive riding on the back of a worm.”\n“How do you know that?”\n“It was all arranged.”\nTeg closed his eyes. He did not need eyes to see the activity all around him. This was like so many command posts he had occupied: an oval room of instruments and people who operated them, officers waiting to obey.\n“What is this place?” someone asked.\n“Those rocks to the north of us,” Teg said. “See them? They were a high cliff once. It was called Wind Trap. There was a Fremen sietch there, little more than a cave now. A few Rakian pioneers live in it.”\n“Fremen,” someone whispered. “Gods! | want to see that worm coming. | never thought I’d ever see such a thing.”\n“Another one of your unexpected arrangements, eh?” asked the officer of the growing bitterness.\nWhat would he say if | revealed my new abilities? Teg wondered. He might", " said. “They will arrive riding on the back of a worm.”\n“How do you know that?”\n“It was all arranged.”\nTeg closed his eyes. He did not need eyes to see the activity all around him. This was like so many command posts he had occupied: an oval room of instruments and people who operated them, officers waiting to obey.\n“What is this place?” someone asked.\n“Those rocks to the north of us,” Teg said. “See them? They were a high cliff once. It was called Wind Trap. There was a Fremen sietch there, little more than a cave now. A few Rakian pioneers live in it.”\n“Fremen,” someone whispered. “Gods! | want to see that worm coming. | never thought I’d ever see such a thing.”\n“Another one of your unexpected arrangements, eh?” asked the officer of the growing bitterness.\nWhat would he say if | revealed my new abilities? Teg wondered. He might think | concealed purposes that would not bear close examination. And he would be right. That man is on the edge of a revelation. Would he remain loyal if his eyes were opened? Teg shook his head. The officer would have little choice. None of them had much choice except to fight and die.\nIt was true, Teg thought then, that the process of arranging conflicts involved the hoodwinking of large masses. How easy it was to fall into the attitude of the Honored Matres.\nMuck!\nThe hoodwinking was not as difficult as some supposed. Most people wanted to be led. That officer back there had wanted it. There were deep tribal instincts (powerful unconscious motivations) to account for this. The natural reaction when you began to recognize how easily you were led was to look for scapegoats. That officer back there wanted a scapegoat now.\n“Burzmali wants to see you,” someone off to Teg’s left said.\n“Not now,” Teg said.\nBurzmali could wait. He would have his day of command soon enough. Meanwhile, he was a distraction. There would be time later for him to skirt dangerously near the role of Scapegoat.\nHow easy it was to produce scapegoats and how readily they were accepted! This was especially true when the alternative was to find yourself either guilty or stupid or both. Teg wanted to say for all of those around him:\n“Look to the hoodwinking! Then you'll Know our true intentions!”\nThe communications officer on Teg’s left said: “That Reverend Mother is with Burzmali now. She insists they be allowed in to see you.”\n“Tell Burzmali | want him to go back and stay with Duncan,” Teg said. “And have him look in on Murbella, make sure she’s secured. Lucilla can come in.”\nIt had to be, Teg thought.\nLucilla was increasingly suspicious about the changes in him. Trust a Reverend Mother to see the difference.\nLucilla swept in, her robes swishing to accent her vehemence. She was angry but concealing it well.\n“| demand an explanation, Miles!”\nThat was a good opening line, he thought. “Of what?” he said.\n“Why didn’t we just go in at the—”\n“Because the Honored Matres and their Tleilaxu companions from the Scattering hold most of the Rakian centers.”\n“How... how do you...”\n“They've killed Taraza, you know,” he said.\nThat stopped her, but not for long. “Miles, | insist that you tell me—”\n“We don’t have much time,” he said. “The next satellite passage will show us on the surface here.”\n“But the defenses of Rakis—”\n“Are as vulnerable as any other defenses when they become static,” he said. “The families of the defenders are down here. Take the families and you have effective control of the defenders.”\n“But why are we out here in—”\n“To pick up Odrade and that girl with her. Oh, and their worm, too.”\n“What will we do with a—”\n“Odrade will know what to do with the worm. She’s your Mother Superior now, you know.”\n“So you're going to whisk us off into—”\n“You'll whisk yourselves! My people and | will remain to create a diversion.”\nThat brought a shocked silence throughout the command station.\nDiversion, Teg thought. What an inadequate word.\nThe resistance he had in mind would create hysteria among the Honored Matres, especially when they were made to believe the ghola was here. Not only would they counterattack, they eventually would resort to sterilization procedures. Most of Rakis would become a charred ruin. There was little likelihood that any humans, worms, or Sandtrout would survive.\n“The Honored Matres have been trying to locate and capture a worm without success,” he said. “I really don’t understand how they could be so blind in their concept of how you transplant one of them.”\n“Transplant?” Lucilla was floundering. Teg had seldom seen a Reverend Mother at such a loss. She was trying to assemble the things he had said. The Sisterhood had some of the Mentats’ capabilities, he had observed. A Mentat could come to a qualified conviction without sufficient data. He thought that he would be long out of her reach (or the reach of any other Reverend Mother) before she assembled this data. Then there would be a scrambling for his\noffspring! They would pick up Dimela for their Breeding Mistresses, of course. And Odrade. She would not escape.\nThey had the key to the Tleilaxu axlotl tanks, too. It would be only a matter of time now until the Bene Gesserit overcame its scruples and mastered that source of the spice. A human body produced it!\n“We're in danger here, then,” Lucilla said.\n“Some danger, yes. The trouble with the Honored Matres is that they’re too wealthy. They make the mistakes of the wealthy.”\n“Depraved whores!” she said.\n“I suggest you get to the entry port,” he said. “Odrade will be here soon.”\nShe left him without another word.\n“Armor is all out and deployed,” the communications officer said.\n“Alert Burzmali to be ready for command here,” Teg said. “The rest of us will be going out soon.”\n“You expect all of us to join you?” That was the one who looked for a scapegoat.\n“lam going out,” Teg said. “I will go alone if necessary. Only those who wish need join me.”\nAfter that, all of them would come, he thought. Peer pressure was little understood by anyone except those trained by the Bene Gesserit.\nIt grew silent in the command station except for the faint hummings and clicks of instruments. Teg fell to thinking about the “depraved whores.”\nIt was not correct to call them depraved, he thought. Sometimes, the supremely rich did become depraved. That came from believing that money (power) could buy anything and everything. And why shouldn’t they believe this? They saw it happening every day. It was easy to believe in absolutes.\nHope springs eternal and all of that gornaw!\nIt was like another faith. Money would buy the impossible.\nThen came depravity.\nIt was not the same for the Honored Matres. They were, somehow, beyond depravity. They had come through it; he could see that. But now they were into something else so far beyond depravity that Teg wondered if he really wanted to know about it.\nThe knowledge was there, though, inescapable in his new awareness. Not one of those people would hesitate an instant before consigning an entire planet to torture if that meant personal gain. Or if the payoff were some imagined pleasure. Or if the torture produced even a few more days or hours of living.\nWhat pleased them? What gratified? They were like semuta addicts. Whatever simulated pleasure for them, they required more of it every time.\nAnd they know this!\nHow they must rage inside! Caught in such a trap! They had seen it all and none of it was enough—not good enough nor evil enough. They had entirely lost the knack of moderation.\nThey were dangerous, though. And perhaps he was wrong about one thing: Perhaps they no longer remembered what it had been like before the awful transformation of that strange tart-smelling stimulant that painted orange in their eyes. Memories of memories could become distorted. Every Mentat was sensitized to this flaw in himself.\n“There’s the worm!”\nIt was the communications officer.\nTeg swiveled in his chair and looked at the projection, a miniature holo of the exterior to the southwest. The worm with its two tiny dots of human passengers was a distant Sliver of wriggling movement.\n“Bring Odrade in here alone when they arrive,” he said. “Sheeana—that’s the young girl—will remain behind to help herd that worm into the hold. It will obey her. Be sure\nBurzmali is standing ready nearby. We won't have much time for the transfer of command.”\nWhen Odrade entered the command station she was still breathing hard and exuding the smells of the desert, a compound of melange, flint, and human perspiration. Teg sat in his chair apparently resting. His eyes remained closed.\nOdrade thought she had caught the Bashar in an uncharacteristic attitude of repose, almost pensive. He opened his eyes then and she saw the change about which Lucilla had only been able to blurt a small warning—along with a few hasty words about the ghola’s transformation. What was it that had happened to Teg? He was almost posing for her, daring her to see it in him. The chin was firm and held slightly upthrust in his normal attitude of observation. The narrow face with its webwork of age lines had lost none of its alertness. The long, thin nose so characteristic of the Corrinos and Atreides in his ancestry had grown a bit longer with advancing years. But the gray hair remained thick and that small peak at the forehead centered the observing gaze...\nOn his eyes!\n“How did you know to meet us here?” Odrade demanded. “We had no idea where the worm was taking us.”\n“There are very few inhabited places here in the meridian desert,” he said. “Gambler’s choice. This seemed likely.”\nGambler’s choice? She knew the Mentat phrase but had never understood it.\nTeg lifted himself from his chair. “Take this ship and go to the place you know best,” he said.\nChapter House? She almost said it but thought of the others around her, these military strangers Teg had assembled. Who were they? Lucilla’s brief explanation did not satisfy.\n“We change Taraza’s design somewhat,” Teg said. “The ghola does not stay. He must go with you.”\nShe understood. They would need Duncan Idaho’s new talents to counter the whores. He was no longer merely bait for the destruction of Rakis.\n“He will not be able to leave the no-ship’s concealment, of course,” Teg said.\nShe nodded. Duncan was not shielded from prescient searchers ... such as the Guild navigators.\n“Bashar!” It was the communications officer. “We’ve been bleeped by a satellite!”\n“All right, you ground hogs!” Teg shouted. “Everybody outside! Get Burzmali in here.”\nA hatch at the rear of the station flew open. Burzmali lunged through. “Bashar, what are we—”\n“No time! Take over!” Teg lifted himself from his command chair and waved for Burzmali to take it. “Odrade here will tell you where to go.” On an impulse that he knew was partly vindictive, Teg grasped O"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_b272e37ca3dbcf7e26536204bdf1d91fab0b1d4330b7efc54d9c44a06f43fd31_v2"}
