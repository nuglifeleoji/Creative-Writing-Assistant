It is known for its bustling business districts, including the **Semba** area, and is a hub for both personal and professional activities of several key characters.  \n\n大阪 is the hometown of **唐泽雪穗 (Karazawa Yukiho)**, where she spent her childhood in a financially constrained environment that prevented her from attending private school. Though it was once her home, she no longer has family ties there. The city holds significant personal history for her: her biological mother lived and was hospitalized there, and it is also where her mother passed away. Additionally, her adoptive mother, **唐泽礼子 (Karazawa Reiko)**, had her funeral held in 大阪.  \n\nThe city is a focal point for investigations, as it is where **笹垣 (Sasagaki)**, a detective, works and where the murder case he investigates takes place. **今枝 (Imashi)** also conducts inquiries here, and it is the current residence of **手冢江利子 (Tetsuka Eriko)**.  \n\n大阪 is significant to other characters as well. **秋吉雄一 (Akiyoshi Yuichi)** grew up there and later returns with **栗原典子 (Kurihara Noriko)** to visit landmarks like **心斋桥 (Shinsaibashi)** and **道顿堀 (Dotonbori)**. 典子 stays in a hotel in the city and takes photographs during her visit. Meanwhile, **雪穗** is set to open a new branch of her boutique, **\"\"R&Y\"\"**, in 心斋桥.  \n\nThe city also connects to the past through subtle details—some plants in a victim’s garden were brought from 大阪, hinting at familial or historical links. Additionally, **永明大学 (Eimei University)**, where **诚 (Makoto)** spent four years, is located here.  \n\nIn summary, 大阪 is a dynamic urban center intertwined with the lives of multiple characters—serving as a hometown, a site of tragedy, a place of business, and a key location for investigations. It bridges personal histories, criminal events, and future ambitions, making it an essential backdrop for the narrative.\",13\n709,高宫先生,高宫先生是唐泽雪穗的前夫，曾与她在大学时期论及婚嫁。他与筱冢一成是大学社交舞社的同伴，两人关系密切。此外，高宫先生曾与今枝先生联系，并透露了筱冢一成委托调查的相关信息。这些描述共同勾勒出高宫先生作为唐泽雪穗前夫的身份，以及他与筱冢一成、今枝先生之间的关联。,5\n708,今枝先生,今枝先生是一名私家侦探，受筱冢一成的委托调查唐泽雪穗小姐的背景。根据现有信息，他在上个月二十日或二十一日后失踪，可能已遭遇不测。今枝先生的调查任务聚焦于唐泽雪穗，但具体细节和失踪原因尚不明确。综合两段描述，可以确认他作为侦探的身份、委托人的姓名（筱冢一成）以及调查对象（唐泽雪穗），同时暗示其失踪事件可能与调查有关。目前没有进一步信息解释其失踪的具体情况或最终下落。,4\n249,公寓,,5\n238,公园,\"**公园**是一个承载着多重记忆与事件的地方。它既是孩子们踢足球、典子拍照的日常休闲场所，也留存着秋吉童年的回忆，他曾常在这个旧式公园玩耍，附近还有一栋老旧的大楼，据说曾发生过命案。此外，公园也是西本文代与桐原洋介交谈后独自荡秋千的地点，以及警察带友彦问话的场所。  \n\n这座公园既见证了平凡生活的片段，如孩童的游戏和人们的休闲活动，也关联着一些隐秘或沉重的往事，包括命案、孤独的沉思，以及警方的调查。尽管不同时期的事件赋予了它不同的意义，但公园始终是一个交织着日常与异常、欢乐与阴郁的复杂空间。\",4\n612,菅原绘里,\"菅原绘里（Eri Sugawara）是一个多面角色，与今枝直巳（Naomi Imaeda）和笹垣（Sasagaki）等人有不同层面的交集。她最初是今枝事务所附近一家居酒屋的员工，今枝曾光顾她的工作地点，并逐渐与她建立信任关系。白天，她在专科学校上课，尽管今枝并不清楚她的具体学习内容。  \n\n菅原绘里与今枝的合作不仅限于社交场合，她还曾假扮有钱人家的小姐前往唐泽雪穗（Yukiho Karasawa）的精品店，并留下联系方式，协助今枝的调查工作。她似乎很享受这类任务，而今枝也会在需要女性陪同的场合付钱请她帮忙。此外，她曾主动联系今枝，告知他关于无声来电和房间异常的情况，表明她对今枝的事务有一定参与度。  \n\n值得注意的是，菅原绘里还与笹垣有过接触，身份被描述为帝都大学附属医院的药剂师，这可能暗示她的职业背景比表面上更复杂，或者她在不同时期从事过不同工作。  \n\n综合来看，菅原绘里是一个灵活且可靠的角色，既是居酒屋员工、学生，又可能具备医疗行业背景。她与今枝的关系介于助手、熟人和临时合作伙伴之间，并在调查中扮演了辅助角色。\",7\n673,栗原典子,\"**栗原典子** (Noriko Kurihara) is a pharmacist working at 帝都大学附属医院 (Teito University Affiliated Hospital), where she is responsible for dispensing medications, verifying prescriptions, and participating in patient care, adhering strictly to standard procedures. She resides alone in an apartment near the Seibu Ikebukuro Line and leads a private life marked by past romantic entanglements and lingering emotional struggles.  \n\nPreviously, she lived with her partner, 秋吉雄一 (Yuichi Akiyoshi), until his sudden disappearance, which left her grappling with loneliness and grief. Her solitude is occasionally interrupted by visits from a former police officer, 笹垣润三 (Junzo Sasagaki), as well as by male acquaintances with whom she shares intimate relationships. Despite her professional diligence, her personal life is complicated by unresolved relationships, including unexpected contact from former romantic interests.  \n\n栗原典子 maintains a routine that includes shopping at convenience stores and preparing meals, but her emotional burdens—stemming from abandonment and unresolved attachments—cast a shadow over her daily life. As the central figure in her narrative, she embodies a juxtaposition of professional competence and personal vulnerability, navigating the challenges of isolation while fulfilling her duties as a dedicated healthcare worker.  \n\n(Word count: 199)\",16\n118,秋吉雄一,\"**秋吉雄一**（真实身份为桐原亮司）是一个复杂而神秘的人物，其经历和行为贯穿多个阶段。他最初是**大江初中三年级八班的学生**，坐在教室中央位置，便于观察他人。这一时期，他表现出异常行为，包括**逃学秘密拍摄女学生**，尤其对**唐泽雪穗**表现出病态迷恋。他还通过拍摄女同学的照片牟利，将照片卖给同学**牟田俊之**。  \n\n成年后，秋吉雄一与**栗原典子**成为同居伴侣，住在她的公寓中。他自称从事电脑相关工作，性格冷淡且支配欲强，对典子态度疏离。两人曾一同前往大阪，期间秋吉雄一表现出对故乡的复杂情感。然而，他后来**突然失踪**，留下极少个人物品，使典子深受打击。他的消失可能与**今枝侦探事务所**调查的失踪案件有关。  \n\n此外，秋吉雄一曾以手持相机的男子身份出现在**清华女子学园初中部**外，继续观察女学生。他的行为还包括伪装身份与女性互动，例如以胃痛为由接近典子，逐渐揭露自己的名字。  \n\n最终，其**真实身份被揭露为桐原亮司**，曾经营一家个人电脑专卖店。这一揭示将他的多重行为串联起来，表明他长期以虚假身份生活，隐藏着更深的秘密和动机。  \n\n总结来看，秋吉雄一是一个充满矛盾的人物：既是普通学生，又是偷拍者；既是典子的伴侣，又是冷漠的失踪者；最终，他的身份揭晓为桐原亮司，暗示其一生充满伪装与隐秘目的。\",22\n684,典子,,21\n682,帝都大学附属医院,\"**帝都大学附属医院** is a university-affiliated medical institution associated with **Imperial Capital University** (帝都大学). The hospital employs multiple pharmacists, including **栗原典子 (Noriko Kurihara)** and **菅原绘里 (Eri Sugawara)**, who are involved in its pharmaceutical operations. The hospital follows strict medication dispensing procedures and utilizes a computerized system for managing prescriptions and exchanging information with external research institutions and pharmaceutical companies.  \n\nNotably, the hospital's computer network has been linked to cybersecurity incidents, including a **hack into the筱冢药品 (Shinozuka Pharmaceuticals) network**, suggesting vulnerabilities or unauthorized access points within its system. While栗原典子 is confirmed to work there as a pharmacist,菅原绘里's role is less detailed but may be connected to these incidents.  \n\nThe hospital serves as both a healthcare provider and a research collaborator, bridging clinical practice and pharmaceutical development. Despite discrepancies in descriptions—such as varying mentions of staff or events—the core details remain consistent: it is a university-affiliated hospital with advanced digital infrastructure, procedural rigor in pharmacy operations, and ties to broader institutional networks, including those implicated in cybersecurity breaches.  \n\n(Word count: 199)\",10\n119,清华女子学园初中部,,6\n137,大江初中,\"**大江初中** is the school where the events of the story unfold, characterized by a troubled classroom environment. It is also the institution where the individual accused of illicit photography by 雪穗 (Yukiho) is located. The school serves as a significant setting, reflecting both interpersonal conflicts and broader social tensions within its walls. The combination of a challenging educational atmosphere and its connection to the accusation of misconduct underscores its role as a pivotal backdrop in the narrative.\",4\n720,婚介所,\"The 婚介所 (matchmaking service) played a significant role in the interactions between several individuals, including 栗原典子 (Noriko Kurihara) and 藤井保 (Tamotsu Fujii), as it was the platform through which they initially met. The service provided Noriko with introductions to six potential male partners, though none ultimately resulted in a successful match. Additionally, the 婚介所 served as the platform where Noriko submitted her personal details, which may have been accessed by 秋吉 (Akihoshi) through the Memorix system. This suggests that the service not only facilitated introductions but also potentially exposed users' data to third-party access.  \n\nIn summary, the 婚介所 functioned as both a matchmaking intermediary and a repository of personal information, connecting individuals like Noriko and Tamotsu while also presenting privacy risks due to possible unauthorized data access. Despite its efforts to arrange introductions, it did not lead to a lasting partnership for Noriko. The service's dual role highlights its importance in facilitating social connections while also raising concerns about data security.\",5\n706,氰化钾,,4\n153,秋吉,\"**秋吉** (also referred to as **Yuichi** by a teacher) is a complex and enigmatic male figure with multiple connections and potential aliases. He is linked to a past investigation, possibly as the husband of a woman inquiring about it, and is also the person from whom **菊池** borrowed photos. Currently, he lives with **典子**, with whom he shares an intimate relationship, though his motives for being with her may be questionable—some suggest he deliberately sought her out.  \n\n秋吉 is described as a busy individual, often occupied with gathering materials and returning late, appearing exhausted and in poor spirits. He has a shadowy past, which he conceals, and is suspected of involvement in illicit activities, including the potential use of cyanide in a planned crime or as part of a murder method for a novel, as he is also rumored to be a writer. His professional background includes working at **Memorix Software Company**, though his current occupation remains ambiguous.  \n\nAdditionally, he has been observed engaging in suspicious behavior, such as being followed near **Shimokitazawa Station**, where he appeared to be surveilling someone or a residence. His personal history includes growing up near a park in **Osaka**, where he has strong emotional ties and childhood memories, including recounting a story about a murder.  \n\n秋吉 has also been implicated in morally dubious actions, such as being accused by **雪穗** of secretly photographing female students from **Seika High School**. Despite these allegations, his exact role in various incidents remains unclear, leaving him a figure shrouded in mystery and potential danger.  \n\nIn summary, 秋吉 is a man with a troubled and secretive past, entangled in relationships, investigations, and possibly criminal activities, making him a central yet ambiguous figure in the narratives surrounding him.\",20\n161,偷拍事件,偷拍事件是清华女子学园初中部附近发生的偷拍学生照片的事件,4\n814,八月,\"去年八月是今枝侦探事务所负责人失踪的时间，也是秋吉雄一携带氰化钾出门的时间\"\"\",2\n671,MEMORIX公司,Memorix公司是秋吉雄一曾经工作的地方,1\n680,DENNY’S,\"DENNY’S is a popular chain of family restaurants known for its affordable Western-style meals and casual dining atmosphere.
