Although her Sisters might sneer at it, poison was an accepted tool of succession... provided the successor possessed further ways to maintain ascendancy.\n“Logno, those Ixians you spoke with today. What do they say of The Weapon?”\n“They do not understand its function, Dama. | did not tell them what it was.”\n“Of course not.”\n“Will you suggest again that Weapon and Charge be united?”\n“Are you sneering at me, Logno?”\n“Dama! | would never do such a thing.”\n“I hope not.”\nSilence. Logno understood that they both considered the same problem. Only three hundred units of The Weapon survived the disaster. Each could be used only once, provided the Council (which held the Charge) agreed to arm them. Great Honored Matre, controlling The Weapon itself, had only half of that awful power. Weapon without Charge was merely a small black tube that could be held in the hand. With its Charge, it cut a brief swath of bloodless death across the arc of its limited range.\n“The Ones of Many Faces,” Great Honored Matre muttered.\nLogno nodded to the darkness where that muttering originated.\nPerhaps she can see me. | do not know what else she salvaged or what the Ixians may have provided her.\nAnd the Ones of Many Faces, curse them through eternity, had caused the disaster. Them and their Futars! The ease with which all but that handful of The Weapon had been confiscated! Awesome powers. We must arm ourselves well before we return to that battle. Dama is right.\n“That planet—Buzzell,” Great Honored Matre said. “Are you Sure it’s not defended?”\n“We detect no defenses. Smugglers say it is not defended.”\n“But it is so rich in soostones!”\n“Here in the Old Empire, people seldom dare attack the witches.”\n“| do not believe there are only a handful of them on that planet! It’s a trap of some kind.”\n“That is always possible, Dama.”\n“I do not trust smugglers, Logno. Bond a few more of them and test this thing of Buzzell again. The witches may be weak but I do not think they are stupid.”\n“Yes, Dama.”\n“Tell the Ixians they will displease us if they cannot duplicate The Weapon.”\n“But without the Charge, Dama...”\n“We will deal with that when we must. Now, leave.”\nLogno heard a hissing “Yessssss!” as she let herself out. Even the darkness of the hallway was welcome after the bedchamber and she hurried toward the light.\nWe tend to become like the worst in those we oppose.\n—BENE GESSERIT CODA\n| he water images again! We're turning this whole damned planet into a desert\nand | get water images!\nOdrade sat in her workroom, the usual morning clutter around her, and sensed Sea Child floating in the waves, washed by them. The waves were the color of blood. Her Sea Child self anticipated bloody times.\nShe knew where these images originated: the time before Reverend Mothers ruled her life; childhood in the beautiful home on the Gammu seacoast. Despite immediate worries, she could not prevent a smile. Oysters prepared by Papa. The stew she still preferred.\nWhat she remembered best of childhood was the sea excursions. Something about being afloat spoke to her most basic self. Lift and fall of waves, the sense of unbounded horizons with strange new places just beyond the curved limits of a watery world, that thrilling edge of danger implicit in the very substance that supported her. All of it combined to assure her she was Sea Child.\nPapa was calmer there, too. And Mama Sibia happier, face turned into the wind, dark hair blowing. A sense of balance radiated from those times, a reassuring message spoken in a language older than Odrade’s oldest Other Memory. “This is my place, my medium. | am Sea Child.”\nHer personal concept of sanity came from those times. The ability to balance on strange seas. The ability to maintain your deepest self despite unexpected waves.\nMama Sibia had given Odrade that ability long before the Reverend Mothers came and took away their “hidden Atreides scion.” Mama Sibia, on/y a foster mother, had taught Odrade to love herself.\nIn a Bene Gesserit society where any form of love was suspect, this remained Odrade’s ultimate secret.\nAt root, I am happy with myself. | do not mind being alone. Not that any Reverend Mother was ever truly alone after the Spice Agony flooded her with Other Memories.\nBut Mama Sibia and, yes, Papa, too, acting in loco parentis for the Bene Gesserit, had impressed a profound strength upon their charge during those hidden years. The Reverend Mothers had been reduced to amplifying that strength.\nProctors had tried to root out Odrade’s “deep desire for personal affinities,” but failed at last, not quite sure they had failed but always suspicious. They had sent her to Al Dhanab finally, a place deliberately maintained as a mimic of the worst in Salusa Secundus, there to be conditioned on a planet of constant testing. A place worse than Dune in some respects: high cliffs and dry gorges, hot winds and frigid winds, too little moisture and too much. The Sisterhood had thought of it as a proving ground for those destined to survive on Dune. But none of this had touched that secret core within Odrade. Sea Child remained intact.\nAnd it is Sea Child warning me now.\nWas it a prescient warning?\nShe had always possessed this bit of ta/ent, this little twitching that told of immediate peril to the Sisterhood. Atreides genes reminding her of their presence. Was it a threat to Chapterhouse? No... the ache she could not touch said it was others in danger. Important, though.\nLampadas? Her bit of talent could not say.\nThe Breeding Mistresses had tried to erase this dangerous prescience from their Atriedes line but with limited success. “We dare not risk another Kwisatz Haderach!” They knew of\nthis quirk in their Mother Superior, but Odrade’s late predecessor, Taraza, had advised “cautious use of her talent.” It had been Taraza’s view that Odrade’s prescience worked only to warn of dangers to the Bene Gesserit.\nOdrade agreed. She experienced unwanted moments when she glimpsed threats. Glimpses. And lately she dreamed.\nIt was a vividly recurring dream, every sense attuned to the immediacy of this thing occurring in her mind. She walked across a chasm on a tightrope and someone (she dared not turn to see who) was coming from behind with an axe to cut the rope. She could feel the rough twists of fiber beneath bare feet. She felt a cold wind blowing, a smell of burning on that wind. And she knew the one with the axe approached!\nEach perilous step required all of her energy. Step! Step! The rope swayed and she stretched her arms out straight on each side, struggling for balance.\nIf I fall, the Sisterhood falls!\nThe Bene Gesserit would end in the chasm beneath the rope. As with any living thing, the Sisterhood must end sometime. A Reverend Mother dared not deny it.\nBut not here. Not falling, the rope severed. We must not let the rope be cut! I must get across the chasm before the axe-wielder comes. “I must! | must!”\nThe dream always ended there, her own voice ringing in her ears as she awoke in her sleeping chamber. Chilled. No perspiration. Even in the throes of nightmare, Bene Gesserit restraints did not permit unnecessary excesses.\nBody does not need perspiration? Body does not get perspiration.\nAs she sat in her workroom remembering the dream, Odrade felt the depth of reality behind that metaphor of a slender rope: The delicate strand on which | carry the fate of my Sisterhood. Sea Child sensed the approaching nightmare and intruded with images of bloody waters. This was no\ntrivial warning. Ominous. She wanted to stand and shout: “Scatter into the weeds, my chicks! Run! Run!”\nAnd wouldn’t that shock the watchdogs!\nThe duties of a Mother Superior required her to put a good face on her tremors and act as though nothing mattered except the formal decisions in front of her. Panic must be avoided! Not that any of her immediate decisions were truly trivial in these times. But calm demeanor was required.\nSome of her chicks already were running, gone off into the unknown. Shared lives in Other Memory. The rest of her chicks here on Chapterhouse would know when to run. When we are discovered. Their behavior would be governed then by the necessities of the moment. All that really mattered was their superb training. That was their most reliable preparation.\nEach new Bene Gesserit cell, wherever it finally went, was prepared as was Chapterhouse: total destruction rather than submission. The screaming fire would engorge itself on precious flesh and records. All a captor would find would be useless wreckage: twisted shards peppered with ashes.\nSome Chapterhouse Sisters might escape. But flight at the moment of attack—how futile!\nKey people shared Other Memory anyway. Preparation. Mother Superior avoided it. Reasons of morale!\nWhere to run and who might escape, who might be captured? Those were the real questions. What if they captured Sheeana down there at the edge of the new desert waiting for sandworms that might never appear? Sheeana plus the sandworms: a potent religious force Honored Matres might know how to exploit. And what if Honored Matres captured ghola-Idaho or ghola-Teg? There might never again be a hiding place if one of those possibilities occurred.\nWhat if? What if?\nAngry frustration said: “Should’ve killed Idaho the minute we got him! We should never have grown ghola-Teg.”\nOnly her Council members, immediate advisors and some among the watchdogs shared her suspicion. They sat on it with reservations. None of them felt really secure about those two gholas, not even after mining the no-ship, making it vulnerable to the screaming fire.\nIn those last hours before his heroic sacrifice, had Teg been able to see the unseeable (including no-ships?) How did he know where to meet us on that desert of Dune?\nAnd if Teg could do it, the dangerously talented Duncan Idaho with his uncounted generations of accumulated Atreides (and unknown) genes might also stumble upon the ability.\n| might do it myself!\nWith sudden shocking insight, Odrade realized for the first time that Tamalane and Bellonda watched their Mother Superior with the same fears that Odrade felt in watching the two gholas.\nMerely knowing it could be done—that a human could be sensitized to detect no-ships and the other forms of that shielding—would have an unbalancing effect on their universe. It would certainly set the Honored Matres on a runaway track. There were uncounted Idaho offspring loose in the universe. He had always complained he was “no damned stud for the Sisterhood,” but he had performed for them many times.\nAlways thought he was doing it for himself. And maybe he was.\nAny mainline Atreides offspring might have this talent the Council suspected had come to flower in Teg.\nWhere did the months and years go? And the days? Another harvest season and the Sisterhood remained in its terrible limbo. Midmorning already, Odrade realized. The sounds and smells of Central made themselves known to\nher. People out there in the corridor. Chicken and cabbage cooking in the communal kitchen. Everything normal.\nWhat was normal to someone who dwelt in water\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1b3419a9bab49de6117492389dc37ea042e0b8b7a6b79bad1a0cd1e6a3ec5b5e_v2"}
