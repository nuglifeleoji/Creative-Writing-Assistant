�福堂！但他嘴里说：“俊武的话我听了很感动。不愧是共产党员嘛！识大体，顾大局……”由于声音太高，他猛烈地咳嗽起来。等咳嗽停息下来，他喘着气说：“我爬不起来，具体事你们就看着办好了。玉亭给咱准备追悼会的事；其它事俊山你就给咱领料上……” \n　　支部会散了以后，孙玉亭就赶忙出去布置开追悼会的事了。金俊山和金俊武又返回到金家湾这面来，领料埋葬的其它事项。 \n　　中午，从西边田家圪崂的山背后，突然涌上来一疙瘩黑云彩；云根下面，隐约地传来沉重的雷音。乌鸦呱呱叫着掠过闷热的村庄，空气中流布看动荡与不安。村民们抬起头惊愕地望着天空，纷纷议论道：这或许是俊斌的死感动了老天爷，要给焦渴而不幸的双水村洒一点甘霖了？” \n　　这时候，在庙坪破庙前的空场地上，孙玉亭夫妇二人正领着村里的一些人忙乱地布置追悼会场。玉亭原准备把追悼会放在学校，但村里许多老人反对，说俊斌是少亡，魂灵不安生，说不定以后会作怪，怕娃娃们害怕。他老婆贺凤英也把他臭骂了一通。玉亭拗不过众人，只好决定把追悼会放在这个破庙前——反正这地方本来就是个神鬼之地！ \n　　妇女主任贺凤英正和一些妇女挂贴挽帐。已经做好的几个花圈，现在放在破庙里的灵柩前。她们并且还为参加追悼会的村民一人准备了一朵小白纸花。孙玉亭破衫子胸前仅有的两颗钮扣中间，别着他给金俊斌写好的悼词，正忙着在一边给石匠们指点打墓碑的事。村中几个手巧的媳妇，这时已经聚在金俊海家，由金波他妈领料着，在她家的缝纫机上为金俊斌缝制入殓的服装。金俊文和十来个打墓人，胸前挂着红布条，在金家祖坟那里按辈数排好的地方，已经把弟弟的墓坑挖好了。在同一时刻里，金俊武正领料一家人，忙着为外村来参加葬礼的亲戚准备饭食……这时候，在亡故人金俊斌家里，王彩娥她妈正对女儿说开导话。这女人看来心肠很硬，她对彩娥说：“不要哭！自己的身子要紧！你先在金家门上呆两年，以后再说以后的话。离开双水村这穷窝子也好，到时候在石圪节或者米家镇给你瞅个人家。俊斌人倒老实，可老实得太死相了，屙屎倒把个命送了！以后寻个灵巧的手艺人，吃酸的喝辣的你也过几天自在日子！”\n######################\nOutput:",
