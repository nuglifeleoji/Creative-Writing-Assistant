This suggests that Bijaz may function as a repository or instrument for recording or identifying individuals deemed disloyal, while Otheym holds authority over him. Their dynamic implies a hierarchical structure, with Otheym as the master and Bijaz as the subordinate, tasked with a role tied to betrayal or justice.
