微的颤抖起来。在隐藏的衣服下，银纹蓝银草上的银纹就像是被激发了一般，迅速延着手臂向上蔓延，转眼之间就蔓延到了他左侧的面颊之上。\n\n    三眼魔猿第三只眼中，也随之映照出了那银纹，它拍出去的手掌几乎是瞬间就改变方向落在了蓝轩宇身边的泥土之中，一抹震惊在它眼底闪过。本能的后退几步。\n\n    而就在这时，蓝轩宇的身体淡化，缓缓的消失在它面前。\n\n    “大意了、大意了。三眼魔猿有精神攻击，怎么能忘，快把蓝轩宇弄出来，检查一下他的精神状况。”牧重天气急败坏的说道。\n\n    先前看蓝轩宇引走三眼魔猿，救下叶灵瞳，都让他们震惊不已，这孩子不只是天赋好，心性也好啊！要知道，在那种危险的情况下，根本就不可能有太多思考的时间，他确实毫不犹豫的把危险带走，这比他的天赋还更加的不可多得。\n\n    然后他们就看到了全力以赴状态下闪避三眼魔猿进攻的蓝轩宇。\n\n    本来他们是不会忘记三眼魔猿有精神进攻力的，但是，蓝轩宇的闪避实在是太巧秒了，几乎将自身十几级的魂力运转到了极限，每一次闪避都让他们有种叹为观止的感觉。这才多看了一会儿，可就在这时，三眼魔猿的精神攻击发动了。\n\n    模拟器之中，其实魂师面对魂兽肯定是危险很小的，毕竟都是虚拟世界。可是，虚拟世界中，精神力却是真正容易出问题的。因为精神冲击也是被模拟出来，却是最不好控制的。这个难题上万年都没有完全解决。\n\n    先前在这次综合测试中之所以有三眼魔猿，那是因为这种魂兽是高傲的，而它所面对的都是十岁以下的孩子，几乎不可能有用出精神冲击的可能。却没想到，真的用出来了，用在了蓝轩宇身上。\n\n    所以，才一发现他动用了精神冲击，牧重天立刻叫停，但他心中却依旧是后悔莫及。因为那精神冲击还是实打实的落在蓝轩宇身上了。这和痛觉不一样，痛觉是会被完全削弱的，最多只保留百分之个位数。可精神冲击却几乎是全部实质的。这要是出事，就麻烦大了。\n\n    他现在心中唯一期盼的就是，蓝轩宇自身精神力有接近百点，能扛住这一下，不至于受到太大的伤害。\n\n    所以，他其实都没有看到蓝轩宇后来吓退了三眼魔猿那一幕，因为那时候模拟器已经在进行断线退出。\n\n    模拟舱开启，老师们飞快的将已经陷入昏迷之中的蓝轩宇从模拟�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
