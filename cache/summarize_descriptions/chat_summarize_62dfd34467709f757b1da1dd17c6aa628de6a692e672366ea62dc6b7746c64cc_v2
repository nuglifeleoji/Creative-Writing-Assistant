Additionally, the DOMEL comprises **assistants and lower-ranking members** of the Bene Tleilax, indicating their involvement in both administrative and subordinate capacities within the broader power structure.  \n\nWhile these descriptions may initially appear contradictory—one emphasizing a defensive, retaliatory role and the other highlighting a supportive, hierarchical position—they can be reconciled by understanding the DOMEL as a multifaceted group. Their defensive duties likely align with their standing as lower-ranking members, suggesting that they serve both as protectors and enforcers under the direction of higher-ranking Tleilaxu leadership.  \n\nIn summary, the **DOMEL** is a **Bene Tleilax-affiliated organization** that combines **defensive operations** with **subordinate service**, reflecting the complex and layered nature of Tleilaxu society.
