引本部军投降。操厚赏之。臧霸又招安孙观、吴敦、尹礼来降；独昌豨未肯归顺。操封臧霸为琅琊相。孙观等亦各加官，令守青、徐沿海地面。将吕布妻女载回许都。大犒三军，拔寨班师。路过徐州，百姓焚香遮道，请留刘使君为牧。操曰：“刘使君功大，且待面君封爵，回来未迟。”百姓叩谢。操唤车骑将军车胄权领徐州。操军回许昌，封赏出征人员，留玄德在相府左近宅院歇定。\n\n    次日，献帝设朝，操表奏玄德军功，引玄德见帝。玄德具朝服拜于丹墀。帝宣上殿，问曰：“卿祖何人？”玄德奏曰：“臣乃中山靖王之后，孝景皇帝阁下玄孙，刘雄之孙，刘弘之子也。”帝教取宗族世谱检看，令宗正卿宣读曰：“孝景皇帝生十四子。第七子乃中山靖王刘胜。胜生陆城亭侯刘贞。贞生沛侯刘昂。昂生漳侯刘禄。禄生沂水侯刘恋。恋生钦阳侯刘英。英生安国侯刘建。建生广陵侯刘哀。哀生胶水侯刘宪。宪生祖邑侯刘舒。舒生祁阳侯刘谊。谊生原泽侯刘必。必生颍川侯刘达。达生丰灵侯刘不疑。不疑生济川侯刘惠。惠生东郡范令刘雄。雄生刘弘。弘不仕。刘备乃刘弘之子也。”帝排世谱，则玄德乃帝之叔也。帝大喜，请入偏殿叙叔侄之礼。帝暗思：“曹操弄权，国事都不由朕主，今得此英雄之叔，朕有助矣！”遂拜玄德为左将军、宜城亭侯。设宴款待毕，玄德谢恩出朝。自此人皆称为刘皇叔。\n\n    曹操回府，荀彧等一班谋士入见曰：“天子认刘备为叔，恐无益于明公。”操曰：“彼既认为皇叔，吾以天子之诏令之，彼愈不敢不服矣。况吾留彼在许都，名虽近君，实在吾掌握之内，吾何惧哉？吾所虑者，太尉杨彪系袁术亲戚，倘与二袁为内应，为害不浅。当即除之。”乃密使人诬告彪交通袁术，遂收彪下狱，命满宠按治之。时北海太守孔融在许都，因谏操曰：“杨公四世清德，岂可因袁氏而罪之乎？”操曰：“此朝廷意也。”融曰：“使成王杀召公，周公可得言不知耶？”操不得已，乃免彪官，放归田里。议郎赵彦愤操专横，上疏劾操不奉帝旨、擅收大臣之罪。操大怒，即收赵彦杀之。于是百官无不悚惧。谋�\n######################\nOutput:",
