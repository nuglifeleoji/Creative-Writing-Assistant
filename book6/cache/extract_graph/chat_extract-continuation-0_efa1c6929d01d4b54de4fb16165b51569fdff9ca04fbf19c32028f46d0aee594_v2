舰队联席会议，是太阳系舰队名义上的最高指挥机构，但与联合国的情况一样，它只有协调功能，没有实际权力。\n　　其实太阳系舰队本身也是名义上的，人类太空武装力量的实际权力由三大舰队的统帅部掌握。好，参加今天的会议，您知道这些已经差不多了，这次听证会就是由太阳系舰队联席会议召开的，他们是面壁计划的继承者。“\n　　这时，全息图像中出现一个显示窗口，希恩斯和山杉惠子的图像出现于其中，他们看上去毫无变化。希恩斯微笑着向罗辑问好，山杉惠子则面无表情地坐在旁边，对罗辑的致意只是微微颔首做答。\n　　希恩斯说：“我也是刚刚苏醒，罗辑博士，很遗憾地得知，在五十光年远的那个位置，您诅咒的那颗行星还围绕着那颗恒星在运行。”\n　　“呵呵，确实是笑话，古代的笑话。”罗辑摆摆手自嘲地说。\n　　“但比起泰勒和雷迪亚兹来，您还是幸运的。”\n　　“看来您是唯一成功的面壁者了，也许您的战略计划真的提升了人类的智力。”\n　　希恩斯也露出了罗辑刚才的那种白嘲的笑容，他摇摇头说：“没有，真的没有。我现在得知，在我们进入冬眠后，人类思维的研究很快就遇到了不可克服的障碍，因为再深入下去，就要涉及大脑思维机制的量子层次，这时，同其他学科一样，他们碰到了不可逾越的智子壁垒。我们没有提升人类的智力，如果说真做了什么，那就是增强了一部分人的信心。”\n　　罗辑进入冬眠时，思想钢印还没有出现，所以他不是太明白希恩斯最后一句话的含义，但他注意到希恩斯这么说时，一直冷若冰霜的山杉惠子的脸上掠过一丝神秘的笑容。\n　　显示窗口消失了，这时罗辑看到会场已经坐满了人，与会者大部分都穿着军装，军装的模式变化并不大，所有与会者的衣服上都没有图像装饰，但他们的领章和肩章都发着光。舰队联席会议的主席仍为轮值，而且是一个文职官员。看着他，罗辑想起了伽尔宁，意识到他已经是两个世纪前的古人了，与那无数湮没于时间长河中的同时代人相比，无论如何自己都是幸运的。\n　　在宣布会议开始后，主席发言：“各位代表，在这次会议上，我们将对本年度第47
