This situation is exacerbated by a lack of effective leadership or support, which has left many of them vulnerable. Despite these challenges, the children are organized into two groups that hold differing opinions about the future of their country, showcasing their ability to engage in critical discussions about societal issues.\n\nOverall, the role of children in this context is multifaceted; they are not only participants in governance but also active contributors to societal recovery, all while navigating the complexities of their circumstances in the aftermath of a disaster.

This catastrophic occurrence has instilled a deep-seated fear and a sense of loneliness among the surviving youth. The ramifications of this event extend beyond individual grief, creating a collective atmosphere of sorrow and abandonment that permeates the lives of those left behind.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, the implications of death are explored through the eyes of the children, who grapple with their newfound reality in a world marked by absence and mourning. The loss of parental figures not only heightens their vulnerability but also fosters a pervasive sense of isolation, as they navigate their lives without the guidance and support typically provided by their parents.\n\nIn summary, the theme of \"\"DEATH,\"\" particularly illustrated through the \"\"Great Death,\"\" encapsulates the emotional turmoil experienced by the characters.
