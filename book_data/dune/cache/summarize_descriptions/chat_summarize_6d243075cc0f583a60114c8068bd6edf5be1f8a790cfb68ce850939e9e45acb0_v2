This lush green environment is characterized by its vibrant trees, which not only enhance the natural beauty of the setting but also provide a sense of tranquility and contemplation for the narrator. \n\nIn the story, the woods become a critical sanctuary for the narrator, who seeks solace and a moment of reflection after fleeing from a burning farmhouse. This act of hiding in the forest symbolizes a deeper sense of uncertainty and the search for safety amidst chaos. The forest is not merely a backdrop; it represents a connection to nature and the life it sustains, as highlighted by Adam's first encounter with this landscape, which embodies the beauty and vitality of the natural world.\n\nAdditionally, the forest serves practical purposes for the characters within the story. It is a place where the narrator and other characters, such as 沙菲, forage for food and gather firewood, illustrating the woods' role as a resourceful environment. This aspect of the forest emphasizes its importance not only as a refuge but also as a provider, showcasing the interdependence between the characters and their natural surroundings.\n\nOverall, \"树林\" encapsulates a rich tapestry of themes, including refuge, survival, and the intrinsic beauty of nature, making it a pivotal element in the narrative.
