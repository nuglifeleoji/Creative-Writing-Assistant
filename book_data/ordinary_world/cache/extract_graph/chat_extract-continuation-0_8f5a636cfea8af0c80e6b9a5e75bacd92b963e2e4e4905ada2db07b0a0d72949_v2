\n　　俊武说的也是实情。金俊山看没办法了，就到学校去找儿子金成，让他骑自行车去石圪节公社找个领导来——双水村的局势一旦失去控制，金俊山的办法就是找公社领导来解决——这倒也不失为良策。 \n　　但小学教师金成嗫嚅着对父亲说：“我是教师，这是村里的事，我怎能把公社领导请动哩？” \n　　不爱发火的金俊山对儿子吼叫说：“你给徐治功和刘根民说，双水村分东西打死了几个人，看他们来不来！”金成只好骑着车子去石圪节……当天晚上，公社副主任刘根民来到了双水村。 \n　　刘主任看了金家湾这个局面，当然生气极了。这位年轻的上级领导把田福堂找来，很不客气地把他批评了一通。 \n　　田福堂大为震惊：这么个娃娃竟然跑来数落起了他？自他当大队领导以来，历届公社领导还没敢这样批评过他呢！即是他做错了事，过去的领导也只是婉转地好言相劝——想不到世事一变，这么个毛头小子倒把他象毛头小子一样指教了一番！ \n　　不过，人家年龄虽小，但官比他大，田福堂只好检讨说他没把工作做好。但又强调说，他也是为了“执行党的路线”，想把这场运动搞得“轰轰烈烈”……刘根民立刻让金家湾的“生产责任制”停止进行，并让村民们把分走的东西先交回来，破坏了生产的工具，根据情况，由破坏者照价赔偿。 \n　　刘根民接着给徐治功打了招呼，索性在双水村住了下来。开始帮助这个村的两个生产队有条不紊地落实生产责任制。他和大小队两级干部组织成立了领导小组，没明没黑进行这件复杂的工作。 \n　　根据外面一些地方的成熟经验，根民和干部社员反复协商后，把土地按川、山、地、坝地和阳、背、远、近分类分级；牛、羊、驴、马，以次等次作价；耙、犁、鞍、锨、铡刀、木锨、木杈、连枷、簸箕以至架子车、钢磨、柴油机等，也统统按好坏折成了钱。土地按人口分。牲畜作价后按人劳比例拉平分，差价互相找补。生产工具纯粹按价出卖给个人。公窑继续作为集体财产保留。树木凡是集体栽种的都作价卖给个人。公路边的树作为集体和国家财产不许动，至于在一九七一年“一打三反”运动中作价归公的私人树木，根据原西县宜粗不宜细的有关政策，活着的归原主，损伤的酌情补钱。另外，大队几个主要领导都给多分了六到十亩土地，以后开会和其它公务误工就一律不再给付报酬了……几乎经过近半个月的忙乱，赶刘根民回公社的时�\n######################\nOutput:",
