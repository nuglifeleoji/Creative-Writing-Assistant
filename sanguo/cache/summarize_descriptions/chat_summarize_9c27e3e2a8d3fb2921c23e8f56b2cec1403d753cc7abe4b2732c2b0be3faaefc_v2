It was a pivotal political and military center for the state of Wei, which was established by 曹操 during the late Eastern Han dynasty. As the capital of 曹操's territory, 许都 was the site of crucial political maneuvers, military strategies, and alliances that shaped the course of Chinese history during this tumultuous era.\n\nThroughout its history, 许都 was not only a hub for military discussions but also a place where important political meetings took place. It was here that military strategies were devised, and urgent messages were dispatched, such as those sent by 刘延 (Liu Yan). The city was integral to the operations of 曹操's power base, where he conducted diplomatic activities, including interactions with figures like 张松 (Zhang Song) and 杨阜 (Yang Fu), who were sent to engage in diplomatic missions on behalf of 曹操.\n\n许都's significance is further underscored by its role in the broader context of the Three Kingdoms period, where it served as a strategic location for the consolidation of power and the formation of alliances. The city was not only a military stronghold but also a center for political intrigue, where plans were laid out to counter rival factions, including the notable figure 周瑜 (Zhou Yu), whose defeat was a goal for 曹操's forces.\n\nIn summary, 许都 stands as a testament to the political and military dynamics of the Three Kingdoms period, embodying the ambitions and strategies of 曹操 as he sought to establish and maintain his power in a fragmented China. Its legacy as the capital of 曹操's territory continues to be recognized in historical narratives, highlighting its importance in the annals of Chinese history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754984048, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 432, "total_tokens": 818, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
