\n　　在田福军回来之前，好心的李向前就率领妻弟润生和妻妹晓霞，把他家的东西几乎都打捆好了。 \n　　这天午饭前，县上许多干部都来为田福军装车——这种帮忙主要是为了表示一种情谊。当然也有个把势利之徒，看原来在原西展不开腰的田福军“高升”了，乘这最后之机，带着巴结的激情，满场吆喝着搬运东西。 \n　　李向前没有来。他昨天就躲着出车走了。可怜的小伙子不愿亲眼目睹这个他热切迷恋过的家庭从这里拔根而去——在这之前，他心爱的人已经远走高飞了。这样的时候，我们真感到心里酸楚。我们能理解他那难言的心情……下午吃过饭后，田福军一家人就要去黄原了——在黄原那面，润叶已经把那一套楼房宿舍收拾得干干净净，在等待着他们的到来。 \n　　上车前，原西县的所有领导和几百名自动跑来的干部，挤在县委大院里送他们。这情景使田福军深受感动。而最使他感动的是过去和他“对着干”的周文龙。文龙特意把他拉在一边，说：“田主任，我过去实在对不起你……我知道这种道歉太肤浅了，我自己过去在迷途中走得太远，我很希望到省党校去学习一两年，你能不能帮助一下我……”他亲切地拍了拍文龙的肩膀说：“年轻人走点弯路不是什么了不起的事。能反省自己，这是一个人成熟的表现。年轻人，甩掉包袱吧！你是国家未来发展的主力。象我们这样的人，理智地说，是为你们下一步大显身手做个过渡……你要去省党校学习的愿望我一定设法满足你！” \n　　周文龙为不耽搁别人和田福军告别，紧紧握了一下他的手，就赶快退开了。 \n　　在田福军和徐爱云与众人握手告别的时候，徐国强老汉已经带着一种别离故土的悲凉心情，茫然地坐了小卧车的前座上，怀里紧紧抱着他那只老黑猫。 \n　　田福军自己就要进车的时候，立在车旁的晓霞却提出不坐他的小卧车，而要坐在大卡车的驾驶楼里。 \n　　“为什么？”田福军问他的怪脾气女儿。本来小车四个坐位，他两口子加上晓霞和她外爷正好。 \n　　女儿嘴伏在他耳边悄悄说：“爸爸，你官大了，要注意群众影响哩！你看这么多人为你送行，这是尊敬你。你不能不识敬。你们三个坐小车可以，我也坐在里面就有点不象话了。你明白吗？田专员！” \n　　啊啊！田福军眼圈一热，用手爱抚地揪了\n######################\nOutput:",
