This tragedy significantly impacts his health, leading to a decline that ultimately results in his passing in the narrator's arms. His death leaves a lasting impression on the narrator, who grapples with grief and the weight of their father's legacy.\n\nDespite his high social standing, the father is noted to lack scientific knowledge, which may have hindered his ability to guide the narrator's education effectively.
