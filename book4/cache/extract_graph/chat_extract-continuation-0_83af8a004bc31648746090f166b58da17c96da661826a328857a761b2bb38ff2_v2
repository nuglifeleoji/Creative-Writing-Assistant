一些“铁姑娘”，忙碌地布置会场。她们把课桌从教室里抬出两张来，拼在一起放到人群面前，上面铺了窑门口摘下来的条格布门帘，又放几个暖水瓶和茶缸，算是主席台了。另外几个男民工，在中间的窑面上斜贴了一条会标：彻底批判资本主义倾向大会。教室其它墙上，间隔斜贴着许多红绿纸写的标语口号。凤英忙里忙出，指指划划，旧红绸袄在短了的外衣下面露出一圈，招引得许多目光都注视她。她那没有血色的脸上，洋溢着出人头地的欢欣。 \n　　院子四周用木棍挑起的一些马灯，和朦胧的月光一起照出开会的人群。他们在焦急地等待着批判大会的开始——早点完了赶快回去睡觉，因为明天还要出山。至于那些妇女娃娃，很大程度上倒是为了来看热闹的；看那十几个阶级敌人站在大家面前，都是些什么样子。听说这几天还捉回来几个“新的”，其中就有他们村兰花的女婿王满银，这更使大家平添了许多兴致。 \n　　当众人等着开会的时候，在小学教师金成的办公窑里，公社副主任徐治功、武装专干杨高虎和孙玉亭一起商量怎样开这个会。金成提着个开水壶，不断给这几个人的茶杯里添水。 \n　　徐治功盘腿坐在土炕的羊毛毡上，一边抽烟，一边严肃地给两个副总指挥布置任务。既要抓革命，又要促生产，使得这位四十来岁的公社领导人，眼睛里都布满了红丝。 \n　　一年前，徐治功一直是县农业局的一般干部，去年才提拔到现在这个岗位上。本来，他爱人在县贸易经理部当会计，一家人都在城里，他很不愿意到这个条件很差的石圪节公社来。但盘盘算算，高低总算提拔了，因此便硬着头皮来上了任。 \n　　一上任，徐治功就想要尽快干出点名堂，看能不能早点回到县上的机关工作。只要回到城里，就是再不提拔也行，平级调动就满意了。如果他户家里的叔叔徐国强还在县上当领导的话，他兴许用不了一年就能实现目标。可徐叔因年纪大不当县领导了。但徐叔的女婿田福军又当了县上的副主任。只要徐叔给田主任说话，他的事也不难办。田福军他哥田福堂就是双水村的书记，因此他在这个队要好好表现一下，让田福堂把他的成绩传到田主任的耳朵里。把公社农田基建大会战放在双水村，正是他竭力争取的。明摆着嘛！这会战在哪个村搞，哪个村就沾光——其它村出人出粮，给这个村子白修地！田福堂能对他徐治功不感激吗？不用说，双水村搞好了\n######################\nOutput:",
