大学和研究所里的同事是不行的，他们与自己一样，都是技术型思维的人；直觉告诉他，这件事已超出了技术之外。他想到了丁仪，可现在这人自己也陷入精神危机之中。他最后想到了“科学边界”，那是一群思想深刻而且活跃的人。\n　　于是，他拨通了申玉菲的电话。\n　　“申博士，我这里有些事，必须到你那里去一趟。”汪淼急促地说。\n　　“来吧。”申玉菲只说了这两个字就挂断了电话。\n　　汪淼吃了一惊，申玉菲平时说话也十分精简，以至于“科学边界”的一些人戏称她为“女海明威”。但这次，她竟连是什么事都不问，汪淼不知该感到安慰还是更加不安。\n　　他将那团胶卷塞进一个提包，并带上那架数码相机，在妻子焦虑的目光中冲出家门。本来可以开车去的，但即使在这灯火灿烂的城市，他在路上也想有人陪伴，于是叫了出租车。\n　　申玉菲住在新城铁线附近的一个高档别墅区，这里的灯光稀疏了许多，别墅群环绕着几个能垂钓的小人工湖，晚上有一种乡村的感觉。申玉菲显然很富有，但汪淼一直搞不清她的财产来源，她以前的研究职位和现在公司中的职位都挣不到这么多钱。不过她的别墅中并没有豪华享受的痕迹，那里是“科学边界”的一个聚会场所，其中的陈设很像一个带会议室的小图书馆。\n　　在客厅里，汪淼见到申玉菲的丈夫魏成。这个四十岁左右的男人，一副敦厚的知识分子模样，汪淼对他的了解仅限于其姓名，申玉菲介绍时也只说了这些。他似乎没有工作，成天待在家里，对“科学边界”的讨论不感兴趣，对家里频繁来往的学者们也习以为常。\n　　但他并非无所事事，显然在家研究着什么东西，整天沉浸在思考中，见到任何人都是心不在焉地打个招呼，然后回到楼上的房间里，他一天的大部分时间都待在那里。一次，汪淼在楼上无意中从半开的房门向里瞥了一眼，看到一个令人惊奇的东西：一台HP小型机。他不会看错的，因为这台设备与他]二作的超导研究中心那台一样，黑灰色机箱，是四年前出品的RX8620。把这台价值上百万的设备放在家里似乎很奇怪，魏成每天一个人守着它到底在干什么?\n　　“玉菲在上面有点事，您稍等一会儿吧。”魏成说，然后走上楼。汪淼本打算等的，但实在坐不住，也跟着走上楼去，看到魏成正要进入他那个放着小型机的房间。他看到汪淼跟来似乎并不反感，指指对面的一个房间说：“哦，就在那个房间里，你去找她吧。”\n　　汪淼敲门，门没锁，开了一个缝，他看到申玉菲正坐在电\n######################\nOutput:",
