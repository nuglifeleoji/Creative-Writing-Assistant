But now, Moneo sensed changes moving in that great body, and at this proximity ... Moneo glanced around the crypt’s central chamber, reminding himself of the many deaths which had occurred here and which were enshrined here.\nIs it my time?\nLeto spoke in a musing tone. “You cannot succeed by taking hostages. That is a form of enslavement. One kind of human cannot own another kind of human. This universe will not permit it.”\nThe words lay there, simmering in Moneo’s awareness, a terrifying contrast to the rumblings of transformation which he sensed in his Lord.\nThe Worm comes!\nAgain, Moneo glanced around the crypt chamber. This place was far worse than the aerie! Sanctuary was too remote.\n“Well, Moneo, do you have any response?” Leto asked.\nMoneo ventured a whisper: “The Lord’s words enlighten me.”\n“Enlighten? You are not enlightened!”\nMoneo spoke out of desperation. “But | serve my Lord!”\n“You claim service to God?”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“Who created your religion, Moneo?”\n“You did, Lord.”\n“That’s a sensible answer.”\n“Thank you, Lord.”\n“Don’t thank me! Tell me what religious institutions perpetuate!”\nMoneo backed away four steps.\n“Stand where you are!” Leto ordered.\nTrembling all through his body, Moneo shook his head dumbly. At last, he had encountered the question without answer. Failure to answer would precipitate his death. He waited for it, head bowed.\n“Then | will tell you, poor servant,” Leto said.\nMoneo dared to hope. He lifted his gaze to the God Emperor’s face, noting that the eyes were not glazed... and the hands were not trembling. Perhaps the Worm did not come.\n“Religious institutions perpetuate a mortal master-servant relationship,” Leto said. “They create an arena which attracts prideful human power-seekers with all of their nearsighted prejudices!”\nMoneo could only nod. Was that a trembling in the God Emperor’s hands? Was the terrible face withdrawing slightly into its cowl?\n“The secret revelations of infamy, that is what the Duncans ask after,” Leto said. “The Duncans have too much compassion for their fellows and too sharp a limit on fellowship.”\nMoneo had studied holos of Dune’s ancient sandworms, the gigantic mouths full of crysknife teeth around consuming fire. He noted the tumescence of the latent rings on Leto’s tubular surface. Were they more prominent? Would a new mouth open below that cowled face?\n“The Duncans know in their hearts,” Leto said, “that | have deliberately ignored the admonition of Mohammed and Moses. Even you know it, Moneo!”\nIt was an accusation. Moneo started to nod, then shook his head from side to side. He wondered if he dared renew his retreat. Moneo knew from experience that lectures in this tenor did not long continue without the coming of the Worm.\n“What might that admonition be?” Leto asked. There was a mocking lightness in his voice.\nMoneo allowed himself a faint shrug.\nAbruptly, Leto’s voice filled the chamber with a rumbling baritone, an ancient voice which spoke across the centuries: “You are servants unto God, not servants unto servants!”\nMoneo wrung his hands and cried out: “I serve you, Lord!”\n“Moneo, Moneo,” Leto said, his voice low and resonant, “a million wrongs cannot give rise to one right. The right is known because it endures.”\nMoneo could only stand in trembling silence.\n“| had intended Hwi to mate with you, Moneo,” Leto said. “Now, it is too late.”\nThe words took a moment penetrating Moneo’s consciousness. He felt that their meaning was out of any known context. Hwi? Who was Hwi? Oh, yes—the God Emperor’s Ixian bride-to-be. Mate... with me?\nMoneo shook his head.\nLeto spoke with infinite sadness: “You, too, shall pass away. Will all your works be as dust forgotten?”\nWithout any warning, even as he spoke, Leto’s body convulsed in a thrashing roll which heaved him from the cart. The speed of it, the monstrous violence, threw him within centimeters of Moneo, who screamed and fled across the crypt.\n“Moneo!”\nLeto’s call stopped the majordomo at the entrance to the lift.\n“The test, Moneo! | will test Siona tomorrow!”\nThe realization of what | am occurs in the timeless awareness which does not stimulate nor delude. | create a field without self or center, a field where even death becomes only analogy. | desire no results. | merely permit this field which has no goals nor desires, no perfections nor even visions of achievements. In that field, omnipresent primal awareness is all. It is the light which pours through the windows of my universe.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe sun came up, sending its harsh glare across the\ndunes. Leto felt the sand beneath him as a soft caress. Only his human ears, hearing the abrasive rasp of his heavy body, reported otherwise. It was a sensory conflict which he had learned to accept.\nHe heard Siona walking behind him, a lightness in her tread, a gentle spilling of sand as she climbed to his level atop a dune.\nThe longer I endure, the more vulnerable | become, he thought.\nThis thought often occurred to him these days when he went into his desert. He peered upward. The sky was cloudless with a blue density which the old days of Dune had never seen.\nWhat was a desert without a cloudless sky? Too bad it could not have Dune’s silvery hue.\nIxian satellites controlled this sky, not always to the perfection he might desire. Such perfection was a machine- fantasy which faltered under human management. Still, the satellites held a sufficiently steady grip to give him this morning of desert stillness. He gave his human lungs a deep breath of it and listened for Siona’s approach. She had stopped. He knew she was admiring the view.\nLeto felt his imagination like a conjurer calling up everything which had produced the physical setting for this moment. He fe/t the satellites. Fine instruments which played the music for the dance of warming and cooling air masses, perpetually monitoring and adjusting the powerful vertical and horizontal currents. It amused him to recall that the Ixians had thought he would use this exquisite machinery in a new kind of hydraulic despotism— withholding moisture from those who defied their ruler, punishing others with terrible storms. How surprised they had been to find themselves mistaken!\nMy controls are more subtle.\nSlowly, gently, he began to move, swimming on the sand surface, gliding down off the dune, never once looking back at the thin spire of his tower, knowing that it would vanish presently into the haze of daytime heat.\nSiona followed him with an uncharacteristic docility. Doubt had done its work. She had read the stolen journals. She had listened to the admonitions of her father. Now, she did not know what to think.\n“What is this test?” she had asked Moneo. “What will he do?”\n“It is never the same.”\n“How did he test you?”\n“It will be different with you. | would only confuse you if | told you my experience.”\nLeto had listened secretly while Moneo prepared his daughter, dressing her in an authentic Fremen stillsuit with a dark robe over it, fitting the boot-pumps correctly. Moneo had not forgotten.\nMoneo had looked up from where he bent to adjust her boots. “The Worm will come. That is all | can tell you. You must find a way to live in the presence of the Worm.”\nHe had stood then, explaining about the stillsuit, how it recycled her body’s own waters. He made her pull the tube from a catchpocket and suck on it, then reseal the tube.\n“You will be alone with him on the desert,” Moneo had said. “Shai-Hulud is never far away when you’re on the desert.”\n“What if | refuse to go?” she asked.\n“You will go... but you may not return.”\nThis conversation had occurred in the ground-level chamber of the Little Citadel while Leto waited in the aerie. He had come down when he knew Siona was ready, drifting down in the predawn darkness on his cart’s Suspensors. The cart had gone into the ground-level room after Moneo and Siona emerged. While Moneo marched across the flat ground to his ‘thopter and left in a whispering of wings, Leto had required Siona to test the sealed portal of the ground- level chamber, then look upward at the tower’s impossible heights.\n“The only way out is across the Sareer,” he said.\nHe led her away from the tower then, not even commanding her to follow, depending on her good sense, her curiosity and her doubts.\nLeto’s swimming progress took him down the dune’s slip- face and onto an exposed section of the rocky basement complex, then up another sandy face at a shallow angle, creating a path for Siona to follow. Fremen had called such compression tracks “God’s gift to the weary.” He moved Slowly, giving Siona plenty of time in which to recognize that this was his domain, his natural habitat.\nHe came out atop another dune and turned to watch her progress. She held to the track he had provided and stopped only when she reached the top. Her glance went once to his face then she turned a full circle to examine the horizon. He heard the sharp intake of her breath. Heat haze hid the spire’s top. The base might have been a distant outcropping.\n“This is how it was,” he said.\nThere was something about the desert which spoke to the eternal soul of people who possessed Fremen blood, he\nknew. He had chosen this place for its desert impact—a dune slightly higher than the others.\n“Take a good look at it,” he said, and he slipped down the dune’s other side to remove his bulk from her view.\nSiona took one more slow turn, looking outward.\nLeto knew the innermost sensation of what she saw. Except for that insignificant, blurred blip of his tower’s base, there was not the slightest lift of horizon—flat, everywhere flat. No plants, no living movement. From her vantage, there was a limit of approximately eight kilometers to the line where the planet’s curvature hid everything beyond.\nLeto spoke from where he had stopped, just below the dune’s crest. “This is the real Sareer. You only know it when you're down here afoot. This is all that’s left of the bahr bela ma.”\n“The ocean without water,” she whispered.\nAgain, she turned and examined the entire horizon.\nThere was no wind and, Leto knew, without wind, the silence ate at the human soul. Siona was feeling the loss of all familiar reference points. She was abandoned in dangerous space.\nLeto glanced at the next dune. In that direction, they would come presently to a low line of hills which originally had been mountains but now were broken into remnant slag and rubble. He continued to rest quietly, letting the silence do his work for him. It was even pleasant to imagine that these dunes went on, as they once had, without end completely around the planet. But even these few dunes were degenerating. Without the original Coriolis storms of Dune, the Sareer saw", " crest. “This is the real Sareer. You only know it when you're down here afoot. This is all that’s left of the bahr bela ma.”\n“The ocean without water,” she whispered.\nAgain, she turned and examined the entire horizon.\nThere was no wind and, Leto knew, without wind, the silence ate at the human soul. Siona was feeling the loss of all familiar reference points. She was abandoned in dangerous space.\nLeto glanced at the next dune. In that direction, they would come presently to a low line of hills which originally had been mountains but now were broken into remnant slag and rubble. He continued to rest quietly, letting the silence do his work for him. It was even pleasant to imagine that these dunes went on, as they once had, without end completely around the planet. But even these few dunes were degenerating. Without the original Coriolis storms of Dune, the Sareer saw nothing stronger than a stiff breeze and occasional heat vortices which had no more than local effect.\nOne of these tiny “wind devils” danced across the middle distance to the south. Siona’s gaze followed its track. She spoke abruptly: “Do you have a personal religion?”\nLeto took a moment composing his reply. It always astonished him how a desert provoked thoughts of religion.\n“You dare ask me if | have a personal religion?” he demanded.\nBetraying no surface sign of the fears he knew she felt, Siona turned and stared down at him. Audacity was always an Atreides hallmark, he reminded himself.\nWhen she didn’t answer, he said: “You are an Atreides for sure.”\n“Is that your answer?” she asked.\n“What is it you really want to know, Siona?”\n“What you believe!”\n“Ho! You ask after my faith. Well, now—I believe that something cannot emerge from nothing without divine intervention.”\nHis answer puzzled her. “How is that an...”\n“Natura non facit saltus,” he said.\nShe shook her head, not understanding the ancient allusion which had sprung to his lips. Leto translated:\n“Nature makes no leaps.”\n“What language was that?” she asked.\n“A language no longer spoken anywhere else in my universe.”\n“Why did you use it then?”\n“To prod your ancient memories.”\n“I don’t have any! | just need to know why you brought me here.”\n“To give you a taste of your past. Come down here and climb onto my back.”\nShe hesitated at first, then seeing the futility of defiance, slid down the dune and clambered onto his back.\nLeto waited until she was kneeling atop him. It was not the same as the old times he knew. She had no Maker hooks and could not stand on his back. He lifted his front segments Slightly off the surface.\n“Why am I doing this?” she asked. Her tone said she felt silly up there.\n“I want you to taste the way our people once moved proudly across this land, high atop the back of a giant sandworm.”\nHe began to glide along the dune just below the crest. Siona had seen holos. She knew this experience intellectually, but the pulse of reality had a different beat and he knew she would resonate to it.\nAhhh, Siona, he thought, you do not even begin to suspect how I will test you.\nLeto steeled himself then. / must have no pity. If she dies, she dies. If any of them dies, that is a required event, no more.\nAnd he had to remind himself that this applied even to Hwi Noree. It was just that a// of them could not die.\nHe sensed it when Siona began to enjoy the sensation of riding on his back. He felt a faint shift in her weight as she eased back onto her legs to lift her head.\nHe drove outward then along a curving barracan, joining Siona in enjoyment of the old sensations. Leto could just glimpse the remnant hills at the horizon ahead of him. They were like a seed from the past waiting there, a reminder of the self-sustaining and expanding force which operated ina desert. He could forget for a moment that on this planet where only a small fraction of the surface remained desert, the Sareer’s dynamism existed in a precarious environment.\nThe illusion of the past was here, though. He felt it as he moved. Fantasy, of course, he told himself, a vanishing fantasy as long as his enforced tranquility continued. Even the sweeping barracan which he traversed now was not as great as the ones of the past. None of the dunes were that great.\nThis whole maintained desert struck him suddenly as ridiculous. He almost stopped on a pebbled surface between the dunes, continuing but more slowly as he tried to conjure\nup the necessities which kept the whole system working. He imagined the planet’s rotation setting up great air currents which shifted cold and heated air to new regions in enormous volume—everything monitored and ruled by those tiny satellites with their Ixian instruments and heat- focusing dishes. If the high monitors saw anything, they saw the Sareer partly as a “relief desert” with both physical and cold-air walls girdling it. This tended to create ice at the edges and required even more climatic adjustments.\nIt was not easy and Leto forgave the occasional mistakes for that reason.\nAs he moved once more out onto dunes, he lost that sense of delicate balance, put aside memories of the pebbly wastelands outside the central sands, and gave himself up to enjoyment of his “petrified ocean” with its frozen and apparently immovable waves. He turned southward, parallel to the remnant hills.\nHe knew that most people were offended by his infatuation with desert. They were uneasy and turned away. Siona, however, could not turn away. Everywhere she looked, the desert demanded recognition. She rode silently on his back, but he knew her eyes were full. And the old-old memories were beginning to churn.\nHe came within three hours to a region of cylindrical whaleback dunes, some of them more than one hundred and fifty kilometers long at an angle to the prevailing wind. Beyond them lay a rocky corridor between dunes and into a region of star dunes almost four hundred meters high. Finally, they entered the braided dunes of the central erg where the general high pressure and electrically charged air gave his spirits a lift. He knew the same magic would be working on Siona.\n“Here is where the songs of the Long Trek originated,” he said. “They are perfectly preserved in the Oral History.”\nShe did not answer, but he knew she heard.\nLeto slowed his pace and began to speak to Siona, telling her about their Fremen past. He sensed the quickening of her interest. She even asked questions occasionally, but he could also feel her fears building. Even the base of his Little Citadel was no longer visible here. She could recognize nothing man-made. And she would think he engaged now in Small talk, unimportant things to put off something portentous.\n“Equality between our men and women originated here,” he said.\n“Your Fish Speakers deny that men and women are equal,” she said.\nHer voice, full of questioning disbelief, was a better locator than the sensation of her crouched on his back. Leto stopped at the intersection of two braided dunes and let the venting of his heat-generated oxygen subside.\n“Things are not the same today,” he said. “But men and women do have different evolutionary demands upon them. With the Fremen, though, there was an interdependence. That fostered equality out here where questions of survival can become immediate.”\n“Why did you bring me here?” she demanded.\n“Look behind us,” he said.\nHe felt her turn. Presently, she said: “What am | supposed to see?”\n“Have we left any tracks? Can you tell where we’ve been?”\n“There’s a little wind now.”\n“It has covered our tracks?”\n“I guess so... yes.”\n“This desert made us what we were and are,” he said. “It’s the real museum of all our traditions. Not one of those traditions has really been lost.”\nLeto saw a small sandstorm, a ghibli, moving across the southern horizon. He noted the narrow ribbons of dust and sand moving out ahead of it. Surely, Siona had seen it.\n“Why won’t you tell me why you brought me here?” she asked. Fear was obvious in her voice.\n“But | have told you.”\n“You have not!”\n“How far have we come, Siona?”\nShe thought about this. “Thirty kilometers? Twenty?”\n“Farther,” he said. “I can move very fast in my own land. Didn’t you feel the wind on your face?”\n“Yes.” Sullen. “So why ask me how far?”\n“Come down and stand where | can see you.”\n“Why?”\nGood, he thought. She believes I will abandon her here and speed off faster than she can follow.\n“Come down and l'Il explain,” he said.\nShe slid off his back and came around to where she could look into his face.\n“Time passes swiftly when your senses are full,” he said. “We have been out almost four hours. We have come about sixty kilometers.”\n“Why is that important?”\n“Moneo put dried food in the pouch of your robe,” he said. “Eat a little and | will tell you.”\nShe found a dried cube of protomor in the pouch and chewed on it while she watched him. It was the authentic old Fremen food even to the slight addition of melange.\n“You have felt your past,” he said. “Now, you must be sensitized to your future, to the Golden Path.”\nShe swallowed. “I don’t believe in your Golden Path.”\n“If you are to live, you will believe in it.”\n“Is that your test? Have faith in the Great God Leto or die?”\n“You need no faith in me whatsoever. | want you to have faith in yourself.”\n“Then why is it important how far we’ve come?”\n“So you'll understand how far you still have to go.”\nShe put a hand to her cheek. “I don’t...”\n“Right where you stand,” he said, “you are in the unmistakable midst of Infinity. Look around you at the meaning of Infinity.”\nShe glanced left and right at the unbroken desert.\n“We are going to walk out of my desert together,” he said. “Just the two of us.”\n“You don’t walk,” she sneered.\n“A figure of speech. But you will walk. | assure you of that.”\nShe looked in the direction they had come. “So that’s why you asked me about tracks.”\n“Even if there were tracks, you could not go back. There is nothing at my Little Citadel that you could get to and use for survival.”\n“No water?”\n“Nothing.”\nShe found the catchpocket tube at her shoulder, sucked at it and restored it. He noted the care with which she sealed the end, but she did not pull the face flap across her mouth, although Leto had heard her father warning her about this. She wanted her mouth free for talking!\n“You're telling me | can’t run away from you,” she said.\n“Run away if you want.”\nShe turned a full circle, examining the wasteland.\n“There is a saying about the open land,” he said, “that one direction is as good as another. In some ways, that’s still true, but | would not depend on it.”\n“But I’m really free to leave you if | want?”\n“Freedom can be a very lonely estate,” he said.\nShe pointed to the steep side of the dune on which they had stopped. “But | could just go down there and...”\n“Were | you, Siona, | would not go down", "Nothing.”\nShe found the catchpocket tube at her shoulder, sucked at it and restored it. He noted the care with which she sealed the end, but she did not pull the face flap across her mouth, although Leto had heard her father warning her about this. She wanted her mouth free for talking!\n“You're telling me | can’t run away from you,” she said.\n“Run away if you want.”\nShe turned a full circle, examining the wasteland.\n“There is a saying about the open land,” he said, “that one direction is as good as another. In some ways, that’s still true, but | would not depend on it.”\n“But I’m really free to leave you if | want?”\n“Freedom can be a very lonely estate,” he said.\nShe pointed to the steep side of the dune on which they had stopped. “But | could just go down there and...”\n“Were | you, Siona, | would not go down where you are pointing.”\nShe glared at him. “Why?”\n“On the dune’s steep side, unless you follow the natural curves, the sand may slide down upon you and bury you.”\nShe looked down the slope, absorbing this.\n“See how beautiful words can be?” he asked.\nShe returned her attention to his face. “Should we be going?”\n“You learn to value leisure out here. And courtesy. There’s no hurry.”\n“But we have no water except the...”\n“Used wisely, that stillsuit will keep you alive.”\n“But how long will it take us to...”\n“Your impatience alarms me.”\n“But we have only this dried food in my pouch. What will we eat when...”\n“Siona! Have you noticed that you are expressing our situation as mutual. What will we eat? We have no water. Should we be going? How long will it take us?”\nHe sensed the dryness of her mouth as she tried to swallow.\n“Could it be that we’re interdependent?” he asked.\nShe spoke reluctantly. “I don’t know how to survive out here.”\n“But | do?”\nShe nodded.\n“Why should I share such precious knowledge with you?” he asked.\nShe shrugged, a pitiful gesture which touched him. How quickly the desert cut away previous attitudes.\n“I will share my knowledge with you,” he said. “And you must find something valuable that you can share with me.” Her gaze traversed his length, paused a moment at the flippers which once were his legs and feet, then came back\nto his face.\n“Agreement bought with threats is no agreement,” she said.\n“| offer you no violence.”\n“There are many kinds of violence,” she said.\n“And | brought you out here where you may die?”\n“Did | have a choice in it?”\n“It is difficult to be born an Atreides,” he said. “Believe me, | know.”\n“You don’t have to do it this way,” she said.\n“And there you are wrong.”\nHe turned away from her and set off in a sinusoidal track down the dune. He heard her slipping and stumbling as she followed. Leto stopped well into the dune shadow.\n“We'll wait out the day here,” he said. “It uses less water to travel by night.”\nOne of the most terrible words in any language is Soldier. The synonyms parade through our history: yogahnee, trooper, hussar, kareebo, cossack, deranzeef, legionnaire, sardaukar, fish speaker . . . | know them all. They stand there in the ranks of my memory to remind me: A/ways make sure you have the army with you.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho found Moneo at last in the long underground corridor\nwhich connected the Citadel’s eastern and western complexes. Since daybreak two hours before, Idaho had been prowling the Citadel seeking the majordomo and there he was, far off down the corridor, talking to someone concealed in a doorway, but Moneo was recognizable even at this distance by his stance and that inevitable white uniform.\nThe corridor’s plastone walls were amber here fifty meters below the surface and lighted by glowstrips keyed to the daylight hours. Cool breezes were drawn into these depths by a simple arrangement of free-swinging wings which stood like gigantic robed figures on perimeter towers at the surface. Now that the sun had warmed the sands, all of the wings pointed northward for the cool air pouring into the Sareer. Idaho smelled the flinty breeze as he walked.\nHe knew what this corridor was supposed to represent. It did have some characteristics of an ancient Fremen sietch. The corridor was wide, big enough to take Leto on his cart. The arched ceiling /ooked like rock. But the twin glowstrips were discord. Idaho had never seen glowstrips before coming to the Citadel; they had been considered impractical in his day, requiring too much energy, too costly to maintain. Glowglobes were simpler and easily replaced. He\nhad come to realize, however, that Leto considered few things impractical.\nWhat Leto wants, someone provides.\nThe thought had an ominous feeling as Idaho marched down the corridor toward Moneo.\nSmall rooms lined the corridor sietch-fashion, no doors, only thin hangings of russet fabric which swayed in the breeze. Idaho knew that this area was mostly quarters for the younger Fish Speakers. He had recognized an assembly chamber with attendant rooms for weapons storage, kitchen, a dining hall, maintenance shops. He had also seen other things behind the inadequate privacy of the hangings, things which fed his rage.\nMoneo turned at Idaho’s approach. The woman to whom Moneo had been talking retreated and let the hanging drop, but not before Idaho glimpsed an older face with an air of command about it. Idaho did not recognize that particular commander.\nMoneo nodded as Idaho stopped two paces away.\n“The guards say you've been looking for me,” Moneo said.\n“Where is he, Moneo?”\n“Where is who?”\nMoneo swept his gaze up and down Idaho’s figure, noting the old-fashioned Atreides uniform, black with a red hawk at the breast, the high boots glistening with polish. There was a ritual look about the man.\nIdaho took a shallow breath and spoke through clenched teeth: “Don’t you start that game with me!”\nMoneo took his attention away from the sheathed knife at Idaho’s waist. It looked like a museum piece with its jeweled handle. Where had Idaho found it?\n“If you mean the God Emperor...” Moneo said.\n“Where?”\nMoneo kept his voice mild. “Why are you so anxious to die?”\n“They said you were with him.”\n“That was earlier.”\n“lIl find him, Moneo!”\n“Not right now.”\nIdaho put a hand on his knife. “Do | have to use force to make you talk?”\n“|I would not advise that.”\n“Where...is... he?”\n“Since you insist, he is out in the desert with Siona.”\n“With your daughter?”\n“Is there another Siona?”\n“What’re they doing?”\n“She is being tested.”\n“When will they return?”\nMoneo shrugged, then: “Why this unseemly anger, Duncan?”\n“What’s this test of your...”\n“I don’t know. Now, why are you so upset?”\n“I’m sick of this place! Fish Speakers!” He turned his head and spat.\nMoneo glanced down the corridor behind Idaho, recalling the man’s approach. Knowing the Duncans, it was easy to recognize what had fed his current rage.\n“Duncan,” Moneo said, “it’s perfectly normal for adolescent females as well as males to have feelings of physical attraction toward members of their own sex. Most of them will grow out of it.”\n“It should be stamped out!”\n“But it’s part of our heritage.”\n“Stamped out! And that’s not...”\n“Oh, be still. If you try to suppress it, you only increase its power.”\nIdaho glared at him. “And you say you don’t know what’s going on up there with your own daughter!”\n“Siona is being tested, | told you.”\n“And what’s that supposed to mean?”\nMoneo put a hand over his eyes and sighed. He lowered the hand, wondering why he put up with this foolish, dangerous, antique human.\n“It means that she may die out there.”\nIdaho was taken aback, some of his anger cooling. “How can you allow...”\n“Allow? You think | have a choice?”\n“Every man has a choice!”\nA bitter smile flitted across Moneo’s lips. “How is it that you are so much more foolish than the other Duncans?”\n“Other Duncans!” Idaho said. “How did those others die, Moneo?”\n“The way we all die. They ran out of time.”\n“You lie.” Idaho spoke past gritted teeth, his knuckles white on the knife handle.\nStill speaking mildly, Moneo said: “Have a care. There are limits even to what | will take, especially just now.”\n“This place is rotten!” Idaho said. He gestured with his free hand at the corridor behind him. “There are some things l'Il never accept!”\nMoneo stared down the empty corridor without seeing. “You must mature, Duncan. You must.”\nIdaho’s hand tensed on the knife. “What does that mean?”\n“These are sensitive times. Anything unsettling to him, anything ... must be prevented.”\nIdaho held himself on the edge of violence, his anger restrained only by something puzzling in Moneo’s manner. Words had been spoken, though, which could not be ignored.\n“I’m not some damned immature child you can...”\n“Duncan!” It was the loudest sound Idaho had ever heard from the mild-mannered Moneo. Surprise stayed Idaho’s hand while Moneo continued: “If the demands of your flesh are for maturity, but something holds you in adolescence, quite nasty behavior develops. Let go.”\n“Are... you... accusing... me... of...”\n“No!” Moneo gestured at the corridor. “Oh, | know what you must’ve seen back there, but it...”\n“Two women in a passionate kiss! You think that’s not...”\n“It’s not important. Youth explores its potential in many ways.”\nIdaho balanced himself on the edge of an explosion, rocking forward on his toes. “I’m glad to learn about you, Moneo.”\n“Yes, well, I’ve learned about you, several times.”\nMoneo watched the effect of these words as they twisted through Idaho, tangling him. The gholas could never avoid a fascination with the others who had preceded them.\nIdaho spoke in a hoarse whisper: “What have you learned?”\n“You have taught me valuable things,” Moneo said. “All of us try to evolve, but if something blocks us, we can transfer our potential into pain—seeking it or giving it. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable.”\nIdaho leaned close to Moneo. “I’m talking about sex!”\n“Of course you are.”\n“Are you accusing me of adolescent...”\n“That’s right.”\n“I should cut your...”\n“Oh, shut up!”\nMoneo’s response did not have the training nuances of Bene Gesserit Voice control, but it had a lifetime of command behind it. Something in Idaho could only obey.\n“I’m sorry,” Moneo said. “But I’m distracted by the fact that my only daughter. . .” He broke off and shrugged.\nIdaho inhaled two deep breaths. “You’re crazy, all of you! You say your daughter may be dying and yet you...”\n“You fool!” Mone"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_6d0150fa7018237b657ec3af38cfd2882a8672eac4bb0cceb1f32f60aff3e13a_v2"}
