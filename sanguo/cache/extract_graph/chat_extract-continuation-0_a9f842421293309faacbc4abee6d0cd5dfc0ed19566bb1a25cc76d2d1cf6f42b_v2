接应。公孙瓒初得赵云，不知心腹，令其另领一军在后。遣大将严纲为先锋。瓒自领中军，立马桥上，傍竖大红圈金线帅字旗于马前。从辰时擂鼓，直到巳时，绍军不进。麴义令弓手皆伏于遮箭牌下，只听炮响发箭。严纲鼓噪呐喊，直取麴义。义军见严纲兵来，都伏而不动；直到来得至近，一声炮响，八百弓弩手一齐俱发。纲急待回，被麴义拍马舞刀，斩于马下，瓒军大败。左右两军，欲来救应，都被颜良、文丑引弓弩手射住。绍军并进，直杀到界桥边。麴义马到，先斩执旗将，把绣旗砍倒。公孙瓒见砍倒绣旗，回马下桥而走。麴义引军直冲到后军，正撞着赵云，挺枪跃马，直取麴义。战不数合，一枪刺麴义于马下。赵云一骑马飞入绍军，左冲右突，如入无人之境。公孙瓒引军杀回，绍军大败。\n\n    却说袁绍先使探马看时，回报麴义斩将搴旗，追赶败兵；因此不作准备，与田丰引着帐下持戟军士数百人，弓箭手数十骑，乘马出观，呵呵大笑曰：“公孙瓒无能之辈！”正说之间，忽见赵云冲到面前。弓箭手急待射时，云连刺数人，众军皆走。后面瓒军团团围裹上来。田丰慌对绍曰：“主公且于空墙中躲避！”绍以兜鍪扑地，大呼曰：“大丈夫愿临阵斗死，岂可入墙而望活乎！”众军士齐心死战，赵云冲突不入，绍兵大队掩至，颜良亦引军来到，两路并杀。赵云保公孙瓒杀透重围，回到界桥。绍驱兵大进，复赶过桥，落水死者，不计其数。\n\n    袁绍当先赶来，不到五里，只听得山背后喊声大起，闪出一彪人马，为首三员大将，乃是刘玄德、关云长、张翼德。因在平原探知公孙瓒与袁绍相争，特来助战。当下三匹马，三般兵器，飞奔前来，直取袁绍。绍惊得魂飞天外，手中宝刀坠于马下，忙拨马而逃，众人死救过桥。公孙瓒亦收军归寨。玄德、关、张动问毕，瓒曰：“若非玄德远来救我，几乎狼狈。”教与赵云相见。玄德甚相敬爱，便有不舍之心。\n\n    却说袁绍输了一阵，坚守不出。两军相拒月余，有人来长安报知董卓。李儒对卓曰：“袁绍与公孙瓒，亦当今豪杰。现在磐河厮杀，宜假天子之诏，差人�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>公孙瓒<|>PERSON<|>公孙瓒 is a
