The seeds of dissolution were being planted.\n“It is my fear, Lord, that | will weaken you,” she said.\n“Then you must find ways to strengthen me.”\n“Can it strengthen you if we diminish belief in the God Leto?”\nHe heard a hint of Malky in her voice, that measured weighing which had made him so revoltingly charming. We never completely escape the teachers of our childhood.\n“Your question begs the answer,” he said. “Many will continue to worship according to my design. Others will believe the lies.”\n“Lord... would you ask me to lie for you?”\n“Of course not. But I will ask you to remain silent when you might wish to speak.”\n“But if they revile...”\n“You will not protest.”\nOnce more, tears flowed down her cheeks. Leto longed to touch them, but they were water... painful water.\n“It must be done this way,” he said.\n“Will you explain it to me, Lord?”\n“When | am gone, they must call me Shaitan, the Emperor of Gehenna. The wheel must turn and turn and turn along the Golden Path.”\n“Lord, could the anger not be directed at me alone? | would not...”\n“No! The Ixians made you much more perfectly than they thought. | truly love you. | cannot help it.”\n“I do not wish to cause you pain!” The words were wrenched from her.\n“What’s done is done. Do not mourn it.”\n“Help me to understand.”\n“The hate which will blossom after | am gone, that, too, will fade into the inevitable past. A long time will pass. Then, on a far-distant day, my journals will be found.”\n“Journals?” She was shaken by the seeming shift of Subject.\n“My chronicle of my time. My arguments, the apologia. Copies exist and scattered fragments will survive, some in distorted form, but the original journals will wait and wait and wait. | have hidden them well.”\n“And when they are discovered?”\n“People will learn that | was something quite different from what they supposed.”\nHer voice came in a trembling hush. “I already know what they will learn.”\n“Yes, my darling Hwi, | think you do.”\n“You are neither devil nor god, but something never seen before and never to be seen again because your presence removes the need.”\nShe brushed tears from her cheeks.\n“Hwi, do you realize how dangerous you are?”\nAlarm showed in her expression, the tensing of her arms.\n“You have the makings of a saint,” he said. “Do you understand how painful it can be to find a saint in the wrong place and the wrong time?”\nShe shook her head.\n“People have to be prepared for saints,” he said. “Otherwise, they simply become followers, supplicants, beggars and weakened sycophants forever in the shadow of the saint. People are destroyed by this because it nurtures only weakness.”\nAfter a moment of thought, she nodded, then: “Will there be saints when you are gone?”\n“That’s the purpose of my Golden Path.”\n“Moneo’s daughter, Siona, will she...”\n“For now She is only a rebel. As to sainthood, we will let her decide. Perhaps she will only do what she was bred to do.”\n“What is that, Lord?”\n“Stop calling me Lord,” he said. “We will be Worm and wife. Call me Leto if you wish. Lord interferes.”\n“Yes, L... Leto. But what is...”\n“Siona was bred to rule. There is danger in such breeding. When you rule, you gain knowledge of power. This can lead into impetuous irresponsibility, into painful excesses and that can lead to the terrible destroyer—wild hedonism.”\n“Siona would...”\n“All we Know about Siona is that she can remain dedicated to a particular performance, to the pattern which fills her senses. She is necessarily an aristocrat, but aristocracy looks mostly to the past. That’s a failure. You don’t see much of any path unless you are Janus, looking simultaneously backward and forward.”\n“Janus? Oh, yes, the god with the two opposed faces.” She wet her lips with her tongue. “Are you Janus, Leto?”\n“I am Janus magnified a billionfold. And | am also something less. | have been, for example, what my administrators admire most—the decision-maker whose every decision can be made to work.”\n“But if you fail them...”\n“They will turn against me, yes.”\n“Will Siona replace you if...”\n“Ahhh, what an enormous if! You observe that Siona threatens my person. However, she does not threaten the Golden Path. There is also the fact that my Fish Speakers have a certain attachment to the Duncan.”\n“Siona seems... SO young.”\n“And | am her favorite poseur, the sham who holds power under false pretenses, never consulting the needs of his people.”\n“Could | not talk to her and...”\n“No! You must never try to persuade Siona of anything. Promise me, Hwi.”\n“If you ask it, of course, but I...”\n“All gods have this problem, Hwi. In the perception of deeper needs, | must often ignore immediate ones. Not addressing immediate needs is an offense to the young.”\n“Could you not reason with her and...”\n“Never attempt to reason with people who know they are right!”\n“But when you know they are wrong...”\n“Do you believe in me?”\n“Yes.”\n“And if someone tried to convince you that | am the greatest evil of all time...”\n“I would become very angry. | would . . .” She broke off. “Reason is valuable,” he said, “only when it performs against the wordless physical background of the universe.”\nHer brows drew together in thought. It fascinated Leto to sense the arousal of her awareness. “Ahhhh.” She breathed the word.\n“No reasoning creature will ever again be able to deny the Leto experience,” he said. “I see your understanding begin. Beginnings! They are what life is all about!”\nShe nodded.\nNo arguments, he thought. When she sees the tracks, she follows them to find where they will lead.\n“As long as there is life, every ending is a beginning,” he said. “And | would save humankind, even from itself.”\nAgain, she nodded. The tracks still led onward.\n“This is why no death in the perpetuation of humankind can be a complete failure,” he said. “This is why a birth touches us so deeply. This is why the most tragic death is the death of a youth.”\n“Does Ix still threaten your Golden Path? I’ve always known they conspired in something evil.”\nThey conspire. Hwi does not hear the inner message of her own words. She has no need to hear it.\nHe stared at her, full of the marvel that was Hwi. She possessed a form of honesty which some would call naive, but which Leto recognized as merely non-self-conscious. The honesty was not her core, it was Hwi herself.\n“Then | will arrange a performance in the plaza tomorrow,” Leto said. “It will be a performance of the surviving Face Dancers. Afterward, our betrothal will be announced.”\nLet there be no doubt that | am the assemblage of our ancestors, the arena in which they exercise my moments. They are my cells and | am their body. This is the favrashi of which | speak, the soul, the collective unconscious, the source of archetypes, the repository of all trauma and joy. | am the choice of their awakening. My samhadi is their samhadi. Their experiences are mine! Their knowledge distilled is my inheritance. Those billions are my one.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe Face Dancer performance occupied almost two hours of the morning, and afterward came the announcement which sent shock waves through the Festival City.\n“It has been centuries since he took a bride!”\n“More than a thousand years, my dear.”\nThe trooping of the Fish Speakers had been brief. They cheered him loudly, but they were disturbed.\n“You are my only brides,” he had said. Was that not the meaning of Siaynoq?\nLeto thought the Face Dancers performed well despite their obvious terror. Garments had been found in the depths of a Fremen museum—hooded black robes with white cord belts, soread-winged green hawks appliquéd across the shoulders at the back—uniforms of Muad’Dib’s itinerant priests. The Face Dancers had put on dark, seamed faces with these robes and performed a dance which told how Muad’Dib’s legions had spread their religion through the Empire.\nHwi, wearing a brilliant silver dress with a green jade necklace, sat beside Leto on the Royal Cart throughout the ritual. Once, she leaned close to his face and asked: “Is that not a parody?”\n“To me, perhaps.”\n“Do the Face Dancers know?”\n“They suspect.”\n“Then they are not as frightened as they appear.”\n“Oh, yes, they are frightened. It’s just that they are braver than most people expect them to be.”\n“Bravery can be so foolish,” she whispered.\n“And vice-versa.”\nShe had favored him with a measuring stare before returning her attention to the performance. Almost two hundred Face Dancers had survived unscathed. All of them had been pressed into the dance. The intricate weavings and posturings could fascinate the eye. It was possible to watch them and, for a time, forget the bloody preliminaries to this day.\nLeto remembered this as he lay alone in his small reception room shortly before noon when Moneo arrived. Moneo had seen the Reverend Mother Anteac onto a Guild lighter, had conferred with the Fish Speaker Command about the previous night’s violence, had made a quick flight to the Citadel and back to make sure Siona was under a secure watch and that she had not been implicated in the Embassy attack. He had returned to Onn just after the betrothal announcement, having had no previous warning.\nMoneo was furious. Leto had never seen him this angry. He stormed into the room and stopped only two meters from Leto’s face.\n“Now the Tleilaxu lies will be believed!” he said.\nLeto responded in a reasoned tone. “How persistent it is, this demand that our gods be perfect. The Greeks were much more reasonable about such things.”\n“Where is she?” Moneo demanded. “Where is this...”\n“Hwi is resting. It was a difficult night and a long morning. | want her well rested when we return to the Citadel this evening.”\n“How did she work this?” Moneo demanded.\n“Really, Moneo! Have you lost all sense of caution?”\n“I am concerned about you! Have you any idea what they’re saying in the City?”\n“I’m fully aware of the stories.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“You know, Moneo, | think that only the old pantheists had the right idea about deities: mortal foibles in immortal guise.”\nMoneo raised both arms to the heavens. “I saw the looks on their faces!” He lowered his arms. “It'll be all over the Empire within two weeks.”\n“Surely it'll take longer than that.”\n“If your enemies needed one thing to bring them all together...”\n“The defiling of the god is an ancient human tradition, Moneo. Why should | be an exception?”\nMoneo tried to speak, found he could not utter\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HWI<|>PERSON<|>Hwi is a significant figure engaged in a deep and complex relationship with Leto, discussing marriage, power, and the future of humanity.
