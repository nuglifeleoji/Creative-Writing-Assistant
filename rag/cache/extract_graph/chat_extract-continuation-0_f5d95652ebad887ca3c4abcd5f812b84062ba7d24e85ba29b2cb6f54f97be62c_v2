What was the God Emperor doing? / came down here to discuss the problems of the peregrination ... and to find out about his intentions toward Siona. Does he toy with me?\n“Let us talk about Siona,” Leto said.\nMind-reading again!\n“When will you test her, Lord?” The question had been waiting in the front of his awareness all this time, but now that he had spoken it, Moneo feared it.\n“Soon.”\n“Forgive me, Lord, but surely you Know how much | fear for the well-being of my only child.”\n“Others have survived the test, Moneo. You did.”\nMoneo gulped, remembering how he had been sensitized to the Golden Path.\n“My mother prepared me. Siona has no mother.”\n“She has the Fish Speakers. She has you.”\n“Accidents happen, Lord.”\nTears sprang into Moneo’s eyes.\nLeto looked away from him, thinking: He is torn by his loyalty to me and his love of Siona. How poignant it is, this concern for an offspring. Can he not see that all of humankind is my only child?\nReturning his attention to Moneo, Leto said, “You are right to observe that accidents happen even in my universe. Does this teach you nothing?”\n“Lord, just this once couldn’t you...”\n“Moneo! Surely you do not ask me to delegate authority to a weak administrator.”\nMoneo recoiled one step. “No, Lord. Of course not.”\n“Then trust Siona’s strength.”\nMoneo squared his shoulders. “I will do what | must.” “Siona must be awakened to her duties as an Atreides.” “Yes, of course, Lord.”\n“Is that not our commitment, Moneo?”\n“I do not deny it, Lord. When will you introduce her to the new Duncan?”\n“The test comes first.”\nMoneo looked down at the cold floor of the crypt.\nHe stares at the floor so often, Leto thought. What can he possibly see there? Is it the millennial tracks of my cart? Ahhh, no—it ts into the depths that he peers, into the realm of treasure and mystery which he expects to enter soon.\nOnce more, Moneo lifted his gaze to Leto’s face. “I hope She will like the Duncan’s company, Lord.”\n“Be assured of it. The Tleilaxu have brought him to me in the undistorted image.”\n“That is reassuring, Lord.”\n“No doubt you have noted that his genotype is remarkably attractive to females.”\n“That has been my observation, Lord.”\n“There’s something about those gently observant eyes, those strong features and that black-goat hair which positively melts the female psyche.”\n“AS you Say, Lord.”\n“You know he’s with the Fish Speakers right now?”\n“|I was informed, Lord.”\nLeto smiled. Of course Moneo was informed. “They will bring him to me soon for his first view of the God Emperor.”\n“I have inspected the viewing room personally, Lord. Everything is in readiness.”\n“Sometimes | think you wish to weaken me, Moneo. Leave some of these details for me.”\nMoneo tried to conceal a constriction of fear. He bowed and backed away. “Yes, Lord, but there are some things which | must do.”\nTurning, he hurried away. It was not until he was ascending in the lift that Moneo realized he had left without being dismissed.\nHe must know how tired | am. He will forgive.\nYour Lord knows very well what is in your heart. Your soul suffices this day as a reckoner against you. | need no witnesses. You do not listen to your soul, but listen instead to your anger and your rage.\n—LORD LETO TO A PENITENT, FROM THE ORAL HISTORY\nThe following assessment of the state of the Empire in the year 3508 of the reign of the Lord Leto Is taken from The Welbeck Abridgment. The original is in the Chapter House Archives of the Bene Gesserit Order. A comparison reveals that the deletions do not subtract from the essential accuracy of this account.\nIn the name of our Sacred Order and its unbroken Sisterhood, this accounting has been judged reliable and worthy of entry into the Chronicles of the Chapter House.\nSisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko have returned safely from Arrakis to report confirmation of the long-suspected execution of the nine historians who disappeared into his Citadel in the year 2116 of Lord Leto’s reign. The Sisters report that the nine were rendered unconscious, then burned on pyres of their own published works. This conforms exactly with the stories which spread across the Empire at the time. The accounts of that time were judged to have originated with Lord Leto himself.\nSisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko bring the handwritten records of an eyewitness account which says that when Lord Leto was petitioned by other historians seeking word of their fellows, Lord Leto said:\n“They were destroyed because they lied pretentiously. Have no fear that my wrath will fall upon you because of your innocent mistakes. | am not overly fond of creating martyrs. Martyrs tend to set dramatic events adrift in human affairs. Drama is one of the targets of my predation. Tremble only if you build false accounts and stand pridefully upon them. Go now and do not speak of this.”\nInternal evidence of the handwritten account identifies its author as Ikonicre, Lord Leto’s majordomo in the year 2116.\nAttention is called to Lord Leto’s use of the word predation. This is highly suggestive in view of theories\nadvanced by Reverend Mother Syaksa that the God Emperor views himself as a predator in the natural sense.\nSister Chenoeh was invited to accompany the Fish Speakers in an entourage which accompanied one of Lord Leto’s infrequent peregrinations. At one point, she was invited to trot beside the Royal Cart and converse with the Lord Leto himself. She reports the exchange as follows:\nThe Lord Leto said: “Here on the Royal Road, | sometimes feel that | stand on battlements protecting myself against invaders.”\nSister Chenoeh said: “No one attacks you here, Lord.”\nThe Lord Leto said: “You Bene Gesserit assail me on all sides. Even now, you seek to suborn my Fish Speakers.”\nSister Chenoeh says that she steeled herself for death, but the God Emperor merely stopped his cart and looked across her at his entourage. She says the others stopped and waited on the road in well-trained passivity, all of them at a respectful distance.\nThe Lord Leto said, “There is my little multitude and they tell me everything. Do not deny my accusation.”\nSister Chenoeh said, “I do not deny it.”\nThe Lord Leto looked at her then and said, “Have no fear for your person. It is my wish that you report my words in your Chapter House.”\nSister Chenoeh says she could see then that the Lord Leto knew all about her, about her mission, her special training as an oral recorder, everything. “He was like a Reverend Mother,” she said. “I could hide nothing from him.”\nThe Lord Leto then commanded her, “Look toward my Festival City and tell me what you see.”\nSister Chenoeh looked toward Onn and said, “I see the City in the distance. It is beautiful in this morning light. There is your forest on the right. It has so many greens in it | could spend all day describing them. On the left and all around the City there are the houses and the gardens of\nyour servitors. Some of them look very rich and some look very poor.”\nThe Lord Leto said, “We have cluttered this landscape! Trees are a clutter. Houses, gardens... You cannot exult at new mysteries in such a landscape.”\nSister Chenoeh, emboldened by Lord Leto’s assurances, asked, “Does the Lord truly want mysteries?”\nThe Lord Leto said, “There is no outward spiritual freedom in such a landscape. Do you not see it? You have no open universe here with which to share. Everything is closures— doors, latches, locks!”\nSister Chenoeh asked, “Has mankind no longer any need for privacy and protection?”\nThe Lord Leto said, “When you return, tell your Sisters that | will restore the outward view. Such a landscape as this one turns you inward in search for whatever freedom your spirits can find within. Most humans are not strong enough to find freedom within.”\nSister Chenoeh said, “I will report your words accurately, Lord.”\nThe Lord Leto said, “See that you do. Tell your Sisters also that the Bene Gesserit of all people should know the dangers of breeding for a particular characteristic, of seeking a defined genetic goal.”\nSister Chenoeh says this was an obvious reference to the Lord Leto’s father, Paul Atreides. Let it be noted that our breeding program achieved the Kwisatz Haderach one generation early. In becoming Muad’Dib, the leader of the Fremen, Paul Atreides escaped from our control. There is no doubt that he was a male with the powers of a Reverend Mother and other powers for which humankind still is paying a heavy price. As the Lord Leto said:\n“You got the unexpected. You got me, the wild card. And | have achieved Siona.”\nThe Lord Leto refused to elaborate on this reference to the daughter of his majordomo, Moneo. The matter is being\ninvestigated. In other matters of concern to the Chapter House, our investigators have supplied information on:\nTHE FISH SPEAKERS\nThe Lord Leto’s female legions have elected their representatives to attend the Decennial Festival on Arrakis. Three representatives will attend from each planetary garrison. (See attached list of those chosen.) As usual, no adult males will attend, not even consorts of Fish Speaker officers. The consort list has changed very little in this reporting period. We have appended the new names with geneological information where available. Note that only two of the names can be starred as descendants of the Duncan Idaho gholas. We can add nothing new to our speculations about his use of the gholas in his breeding program.\nNone of our efforts to form an alliance between Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserit succeeded during this period. Lord Leto continues to increase certain garrison sizes. He also continues to emphasize the alternative missions of the Fish Speakers, deemphasizing their military missions. This has had the expected result of increasing local admiration and respect and gratitude for the presence of the Fish Speaker garrisons. (See attached list for garrisons which were increased in size. Editor’s note: The only pertinent garrisons were those on the home planets of the Bene Gesserit, Ixians and Tleilaxu. Spacing Guild monitors were not increased.)\nPRIESTHOOD\nExcept for the few natural deaths and replacements which are listed in attachments, there have been no significant changes. Those consorts and officers delegated to perform the ritual duties remain few, their powers abridged by continuing requirement for consultation with Arrakis before taking any important action. It is the opinion of the Reverend Mother Syaksa and some others that the religious character of the Fish Speakers is slowly being devolved.\nBREEDING PROGRAM\nOther than the unexplained reference to Siona and to our failure with his father, we have nothing significant to add to our continued monitoring of the Lord Leto’s breeding program. There is evidence of a certain randomness in his plan which is reinforced by the Lord Leto’s statement about genetic goals, but we cannot be certain that he was truthful with Sister Chenoeh. We call your attention to the many instances where he has either lied or changed directions dramatically\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The God Emperor, also known as Lord Leto, is the ruler of the Empire and a central figure in the narrative.
