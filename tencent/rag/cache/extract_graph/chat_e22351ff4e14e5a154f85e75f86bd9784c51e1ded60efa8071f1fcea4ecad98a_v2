He had to get at that current, see it in motion.\n“We were right to focus on CHOAM and the Landsraad,” lrulan drawled. “And Duncan’s suggestion offers a first line of inquiry for—”\n“Money as a translation of energy can’t be separated from the energy it expresses,” Alia said. “We all know this. But we have to answer three specific questions: When? Using what weapons? Where?”\nThe twins... the twins, Idaho thought. /t’s the twins who're in danger, not Alia.\n“You're not interested in who or how?” Irulan asked.\n“If House Corrino or CHOAM or any other group employs human instruments on this planet,” Alia said, “we stand a better than sixty percent chance of finding them before they act. Knowing when they'll act and where gives us a bigger leverage on those odds. How? That’s just asking what weapons?”\nWhy can’t they see it as | see it? Idaho wondered.\n“All right,” Irulan said. “When?”\n“When attention is focused on someone else,” Alia said.\n“Attention was focused on your mother at the Convocation,” Irulan said. “There was no attempt.”\n“Wrong place,” Alia said.\nWhat is she doing? Idaho wondered.\n“Where, then?” Irulan asked.\n“Right here in the Keep,” Alia said. “It’s the place where I'd feel most secure and least on my guard.”\n“What weapons?” Irulan asked.\n“Conventional—something a Fremen might have on his person: poisoned crysknife, maula pistol, a—”\n“They’ve not tried a hunter-seeker in a long while,” Irulan Said.\n“Wouldn’t work in a crowd,” Alia said. “There’ll have to be a crowd.”\n“Biological weapon?” Irulan asked.\n“An infectious agent?” Alia asked, not masking her incredulity. How could Irulan think an infectious agent would succeed against the immunological barriers which protected an Atreides?\n“I was thinking more in the line of some animal,” Irulan said. “A small pet, say, trained to bite a specific victim, inflicting a poison with its bite.”\n“The House ferrets will prevent that,” Alia said.\n“One of them, then?” Irulan asked.\n“Couldn’t be done. The House ferrets would reject an outsider, kill it. You know that.”\n“I was just exploring possibilities in the hope that—”\n“I'll alert my guards,” Alia said.\nAs Alia said guards, Idaho put a hand over his Tleilaxu eyes, trying to prevent the demanding involvement which swept over him. It was Rhajia, the movement of Infinity as expressed by Life, the latent cup of total immersion in mentat awareness which lay in wait for every mentat. It threw his awareness onto the universe like a net, falling, defining the shapes within it. He saw the twins crouching in darkness while giant claws raked the air about them.\n“No,” he whispered.\n“What?” Alia looked at him as though surprised to find him still there.\nHe took his hand from his eyes.\n“The garments that House Corrino sent?” he asked. “Have they been sent on to the twins?”\n“Of course,” Irulan said. “They’re perfectly safe.”\n“No one’s going to try for the twins at Sietch Tabr,” Alia said. “Not with all of those Stilgar-trained guards around.”\nIdaho stared at her. He had no particular datum to reinforce an argument based on mentat computation, but he knew. He knew. This thing he’d experienced came very close to the visionary power which Paul had known. Neither lrulan nor Alia would believe it, coming from him.\n“ld like to alert the port authorities against allowing the importation of any outside animals,” he said.\n“You're not taking Irulan’s suggestion seriously,” Alia protested.\n“Why take any chances?” he asked.\n“Tell that to the smugglers,” Alia said. “lIl put my dependence on the House ferrets.”\nIdaho shook his head. What could House ferrets do against claws the size of those he envisioned? But Alia was right. Bribes in the right places, one acquiescent Guild navigator, and anyplace in the Empty Quarter became a landing port. The Guild would resist a front position in any attack on House Atreides, but if the price were high enough... Well, the Guild could only be thought of as something like a geological barrier which made attacks difficult, but not impossible. They could always protest that they were just “a transportation agency.” How could they know to what use a particular cargo would be put?\nAlia broke the silence with a purely Fremen gesture, a raised fist with thumb horizontal. She accompanied the gesture with a traditional expletive which meant, “I give Typhoon Conflict.” She obviously saw herself as the only logical target for assassins, and the gesture protested a\nuniverse full of undigested threats. She was saying she would hurl the death wind at anyone who attacked her.\nIdaho felt the hopelessness of any protest. He saw that she no longer suspected him. He was going back to Tabr and she expected a perfectly executed abduction of the Lady Jessica. He lifted himself from the divan in an adrenaline surge of anger, thinking: /f only Alia were the target! If only assassins could get to her! For an instant, he rested his hand on his own knife, but it was not in him to do this. Far better, though, that she die a martyr than live to be discredited and hounded into a sandy grave.\n“Yes,” Alia said, misinterpreting his expression as concern for her. “You'd best hurry back to Tabr.” And she thought: How foolish of me to suspect Duncan! He’s mine, not Jessica’s! It had been the demand from the tribes that’d upset her, Alia thought. She waved an airy goodbye to Idaho as he left.\nIdaho left the Council Chamber feeling hopeless. Not only was Alia blind with her alien possession, but she became more insane with each crisis. She’d already passed her danger point and was doomed. But what could be done for the twins? Whom could he convince? Stilgar? And what could Stilgar do that he wasn’t already doing?\nThe Lady Jessica, then?\nYes, he’d explore that possibility—but she, too, might be far gone in plotting with her Sisterhood. He carried few illusions about that Atreides concubine. She might do anything at the command of the Bene Gesserits—even turn against her own grandchildren.\nGood government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.\n—LAW AND GOVERNANCE THE SPACING GUILD MANUAL\nhy does Alia wish me to share the morning audience? Jessica wondered. They’ve not voted me back into the Council.\nJessica stood in the anteroom to the Keep’s Great Hall. The anteroom itself would have been a great hall anywhere other than Arrakis. Following the Atreides lead, buildings in Arrakeen had become ever more gigantic as wealth and power concentrated, and this room epitomized her misgivings. She did not like this anteroom with its tiled floor depicting her son’s victory over Shaddam IV.\nShe caught a reflection of her own face in the polished plasteel door which led into the Great Hall. Returning to Dune forced such comparisons upon her, and Jessica noted only the signs of aging in her own features: the oval face had developed tiny lines and the eyes were more brittle in their indigo reflection. She could remember when there had been white around the blue of her eyes. Only the careful ministrations of a professional dresser maintained the polished bronze of her hair. Her nose remained small, mouth generous, and her body was still slender, but even the Bene Gesserit-trained muscles had a tendency toward slowing with the passage of time. Some might not note this and say: “You haven’t changed a bit!” But the Sisterhood’s training\nwas a two-edged sword; small changes seldom escaped the notice of people thus trained.\nAnd the lack of small changes in Alia had not escaped Jessica’s notice.\nJavid, the master of Alia’s appointments, stood at the great door, being very official this morning. He was a robed genie with a cynical smile on his round face. Javid struck Jessica as a paradox: a well-fed Fremen. Noting her attention upon him, Javid smiled knowingly, shrugged. His attendance in Jessica’s entourage had been short, as he’d known it would be. He hated Atreides, but he was Alia’s man in more ways than one, if the rumors were to be believed.\nJessica saw the shrug, thought: This is the age of the shrug. He knows I’ve heard all the stories about him and he doesn’t care. Our civilization could well die of indifference within it before succumbing to external attack.\nThe guards Gurney had assigned her before leaving for the smugglers and the desert hadn’t liked her coming here without their attendance. But Jessica felt oddly safe. Let someone make a martyr of her in this place; Alia wouldn’t survive it. Alia would know that.\nWhen Jessica failed to respond to his shrug and smile, Javid coughed, a belching disturbance of his larynx which could only have been achieved with practice. It was like a secret language. It said: “We understand the nonsense of all this pomp, My Lady. Isn’t it wonderful what humans can be made to believe!”\nWonderful! Jessica agreed, but her face gave no indication of the thought.\nThe anteroom was quite full now, all of the morning’s permitted supplicants having received their right of entrance from Javid’s people. The outer doors had been closed. Supplicants and attendants kept a polite distance from Jessica, but observed that she wore the formal black aba of a Fremen Reverend Mother. This would raise many questions. No mark of Muad’Dib’s priesthood could be seen\non her person. Conversations hummed as the people divided their attention between Jessica and the small side door through which Alia would come to lead them into the Great Hall. It was obvious to Jessica that the old pattern which defined where the Regency’s powers lay had been Shaken.\n| did that just by coming here, she thought. But I came because Alia invited me.\nReading the signs of disturbance, Jessica realized Alia was deliberately prolonging this moment, allowing the subtle currents to run their course here. Alia would be watching from a spy hole, of course. Few subtleties of Alia’s behavior escaped Jessica, and she felt with each passing minute how right she’d been to accept the mission which the Sisterhood had pressed upon her.\n“Matters cannot be allowed to continue in this way,” the leader of the Bene Gesserit delegation had argued. “Surely the signs of decay have not escaped you—you of all people! We know why you left us, but we know also how you were trained. Nothing was stinted in your education. You are an adept of the Panoplia Prophetica and you must know when the souring of a powerful religion threatens us all.”\nJessica had pursed her lips in thought while staring out a window at the soft signs of spring at Castle Caladan. She did not like to direct her thinking in such a logical fashion. One of the first lessons of the Sisterhood had been to reserve an attitude of questioning distrust for anything which came in the guise of logic. But the members of the delegation had known that, too.\nHow moist the air had been that morning\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e22351ff4e14e5a154f85e75f86bd9784c51e1ded60efa8071f1fcea4ecad98a_v2"}
