It was replaced now by the strum of a baliset, first a nine-scale chord, then the clear notes of a song which was popular on the Naraj worlds.\nAs his eyes adjusted to the light, Scytale saw a youth sitting cross-legged on a low divan beneath arches to his\nright. The youth’s eyes were empty sockets. With that uncanny facility of the blind, he began singing the moment Scytale focused on him. The voice was high and sweet:\nA wind has blown the land away And blown the sky away\nAnd all the men!\nWho is this wind?\nThe trees stand unbent, Drinking where men drank.\nI’ve known too many worlds, Too many men,\nToo many trees,\nToo many winds.\nThose were not the original words of the song, Scytale noted. Farok led him away from the youth and under the arches on the opposite side, indicated cushions scattered over the tile floor. The tile was worked into designs of sea creatures.\n“There is a cushion once occupied in sietch by Muad’Dib,” Farok said, indicating a round, black mound: “It is yours now.”\n“lam in your debt,” Scytale said, sinking to the black mound. He smiled. Farok displayed wisdom. A sage spoke of loyalty even while listening to songs of hidden meaning and words with secret messages. Who could deny the terrifying powers of the tyrant Emperor?\nInserting his words across the song without breaking the meter, Farok said: “Does my son’s music disturb you?”\nScytale gestured to a cushion facing him, put his back against a cool pillar. “Il enjoy music.”\n“My son lost his eyes in the conquest of Naraj,” Farok said. “He was nursed there and should have stayed. No woman of the People will have him thus. | find it curious, though, to know | have grandchildren on Naraj that | may never see. Do you know the Naraj worlds, Zaal?”\n“In my youth, | toured there with a troupe of my fellow Face Dancers,” Scytale said.\n“You are a Face Dancer, then,” Farok said. “I had wondered at your features. They reminded me of a man | knew here once.”\n“Duncan Idaho?”\n“That one, yes. A swordmaster in the Emperor’s pay.”\n“He was killed, so it is said.”\n“So it is said,” Farok agreed. “Are you truly a man, then? I’ve heard stories about Face Dancers that...” He shrugged.\n“We are Jadacha hermaphrodites,” Scytale said, “either sex at will. For the present, | am aman.”\nFarok pursed his lips in thought, then: “May I call for refreshments? Do you desire water? Iced fruit?”\n“Talk will suffice,” Scytale said.\n“The guest’s wish is a command,” Farok said, settling to the cushion which faced Scytale.\n“Blessed is Abu d’ Dhur, Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time,” Scytale said. And he thought: There! I’ve told him straight out that | come from a Guild Steersman and wear the Steersman’s concealment.\n“Thrice blessed,” Farok said, folding his hands into his lap in the ritual clasp. They were old, heavily veined hands.\n“An object seen from a distance betrays only its principle,” Scytale said, revealing that he wished to discuss the Emperor’s fortress Keep.\n“That which is dark and evil may be seen for evil at any distance,” Farok said, advising delay.\nWhy? Scytale wondered. But he said: “How did your son lose his eyes?”\n“The Naraj defenders used a stone burner,” Farok said. “My son was too close. Cursed atomics! Even the stone burner should be outlawed.”\n“It skirts the intent of the law,” Scytale agreed. And he thought: A stone burner on Naraj! We weren't told of that.\nWhy does this old man speak of stone burners here?\n“| offered to buy Tleilaxu eyes for him from your masters,” Farok said. “But there’s a story in the legions that Tleilaxu eyes enslave their users. My son told me that such eyes are metal and he is flesh, that such a union must be sinful.”\n“The principle of an object must fit its original intent,” Scytale said, trying to turn the conversation back to the information he sought.\nFarok’s lips went thin, but he nodded. “Speak openly of what you wish,” he said. “We must put our trust in your Steersman.”\n“Have you ever entered the Imperial Keep?” Scytale asked.\n“I was there for the feast celebrating the Molitor victory. It was cold in all that stone despite the best Ixian space heaters. We slept on the terrace of Alia’s Fane the night before. He has trees in there, you know—trees from many worlds. We Bashars were dressed in our finest green robes and had our tables set apart. We ate and drank too much. | was disgusted with some of the things | saw. The walking wounded came, dragging themselves along on their crutches. | do not think our Muad’Dib knows how many men he has maimed.”\n“You objected to the feast?” Scytale asked, speaking from a knowledge of the Fremen orgies which were ignited by spice-beer.\n“It was not like the mingling of our souls in the sietch,” Farok said. “There was no tau. For entertainment, the troups had slave girls, and the men shared the stories of their battles and their wounds.”\n“So you were inside that great pile of stone,” Scytale said.\n“Muad’Dib came out to us on the terrace,” Farok said. ““Good fortune to us all,’ he said. The greeting drill of the desert in that place!”\n“Do you know the location of his private apartments?” Scytale asked.\n“Deep inside,” Farok said. “Somewhere deep inside. | am told he and Chani live a nomadic life and that all within the walls of their Keep. Out to the Great Hall he comes for the public audiences. He has reception halls and formal meeting places, a whole wing for his personal guard, places for the ceremonies and an inner section for communications. There is a room far beneath his fortress, | am told, where he keeps a stunted worm surrounded by a water moat with which to poison it. Here is where he reads the future.”\nMyth all tangled up with facts, Scytale thought.\n“The apparatus of government accompanies him everywhere,” Farok grumbled. “Clerks and attendants and attendants for the attendants. He trusts only the ones such as Stilgar who were very close to him in the old days.”\n“Not you,” Scytale said.\n“I think he has forgotten my existence,” Farok said.\n“How does he come and go when he leaves that building?” Scytale asked.\n“He has a tiny ‘thopter landing which juts from an inner wall,” Farok said. “I am told Muad’Dib will not permit another to handle the controls for a landing there. It requires an approach, so it is said, where the slightest miscalculation would plunge him down a sheer cliff of wall into one of his accursed gardens.”\nScytale nodded. This, most likely, was true. Such an aerial entry to the Emperor’s quarters would carry a certain measure of security. The Atreides were superb pilots all.\n“He uses men to carry his distrans messages,” Farok said. “It demeans men to implant wave translators in them. A man’s voice should be his own to command. It should not carry another man’s message hidden within its sounds.”\nScytale shrugged. All great powers used the distrans in this age. One could never tell what obstacle might be placed between sender and addressee. The distrans defied political\ncryptology because it relied on subtle distortions of natural sound patterns which could be scrambled with enormous intricacy.\n“Even his tax officials use this method,” Farok complained. “In my day, the distrans was implanted only in the lower animals.”\nBut revenue information must be kept secret, Scytale thought. More than one government has fallen because people discovered the real extent of official wealth.\n“How do the Fremen cohorts feel now about Muad’Dib’s Jinad?” Scytale asked. “Do they object to making a god out of their Emperor?”\n“Most of them don’t even consider this,” Farok said. “They think of the Jinad the way | thought of it—most of them. It is a source of strange experiences, adventure, wealth. This graben hovel in which | live”—Farok gestured at the courtyard—“it cost sixty lidas of spice. Ninety kontars! There was a time when I could not even imagine such riches.” He shook his head.\nAcross the courtyard, the blind youth took up the notes of a love ballad on his baliset.\nNinety kontars, Scytale thought. How strange. Great riches, certainly. Farok’s hovel would be a palace on many another world, but all things were relative—even the kontar. Did Farok, for example, know whence came his measure for this weight of spice? Did he ever think to himself that one and a half kontar once limited a camel load? Not likely. Farok might never even have heard of a camel or of the Golden Age of Earth.\nHis words oddly in rhythm to the melody of his son’s baliset, Farok said: “I owned a crysknife, water rings to ten liters, my own lance which had been my father’s, a coffee service, a bottle made of red glass older than any memory in my sietch. | had my own share of our spice, but no money. | was rich and did not know it. Two wives | had: one plain and dear to me, the other stupid and obstinate, but\nwith form and face of an angel. | was a Fremen Naib, a rider of worms, master of the leviathan and of the sand.”\nThe youth across the courtyard picked up the beat of his melody.\n“I knew many things without the need to think about them,” Farok said. “I knew there was water far beneath our sand, held there in bondage by the Little Makers. | knew that my ancestors sacrificed virgins to Shai-hulud .. . before Liet-Kynes made us stop. It was wrong of us to stop. | had seen the jewels in the mouth of a worm. My soul had four gates and | knew them all.”\nHe fell silent, musing.\n“Then the Atreides came with his witch mother,” Scytale said.\n“The Atreides came,” Farok agreed. “The one we named Usul/ in our sietch, his private name among us. Our Muad’Dib, our Mahdi! And when he called for the Jihad, | was one of those who asked: ‘Why should | go to fight there? | have no relatives there.’ But other men went— young men, friends, companions of my childhood. When they returned, they spoke of wizardry, of the power in this Atreides savior. He fought our enemy, the Harkonnen. Liet- Kynes, who had promised us a paradise upon our planet, blessed him. It was said this Atreides came to change our world and our universe, that he was the man to make the golden flower blossom in the night.”\nFarok held up his hands, examined the palms. “Men pointed to First Moon and said: ‘His soul is there.’ Thus, he was called Mu\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3465deae763a40daa0340c3ebf43cc14b99fa137ee976bc6a95ddc5f64044cff_v2"}
