“你好啦？”叶灵瞳一脸喜色的说道。\n------------\n\n第八十一章 刘锋\n\n    蓝轩宇点了点头，“好了。”\n\n    “太好了。那天，真的是谢谢你。”叶灵瞳少有的对蓝轩宇保有好态度。\n\n    蓝轩宇摇头道：“和你没关系，是那个魂兽比较特殊，而且我也没事了。嗯，我饿了，先吃饭了哈！”一边说着，他绕过身前的叶灵瞳，跟着钱磊去盛饭了。\n\n    叶灵瞳自然能感受到他身上带来的疏离感，不禁皱了皱眉，但终究还是忍了下来。一想到那天蓝轩宇义无反顾的引走了三眼魔猿，她心中最柔软的地方就会被触及。和他竞争之心也比以前淡的多了。\n\n    “你认识叶灵瞳啊？”钱磊低声向蓝轩宇问道。\n\n    “嗯，我们以前在一个学校，不是一个班。”蓝轩宇回答道。\n\n    钱磊嘿嘿一笑，道：“我跟你说，她可厉害了。上学第二天就打架来着，还赢了。咱们班女生中，她的实力估计能排前三。”\n\n    “哦。”蓝轩宇对叶灵瞳的情况并没有什么兴趣，但对于她的强势却是很清楚的。\n\n    食堂的饭菜非常丰盛，蓝轩宇看了一下就发现，并不是所有菜肴都是珍稀食材，只有几种里面有，比自己原来在家的时候得到的要少许多。而看起来，同学们似乎并不太清楚哪些是珍稀食材，所有菜肴剩余的都差不多。\n\n    他自然不会客气，为了能少吃点，专门捡珍稀食材做的菜肴盛，一会儿就弄了一大盘子。\n\n    此时，叶灵瞳已经回到了先前她所在的餐桌，同桌的还有两名男生。其中一名身材高大，有着一头金色短发，眼眸开合之间，小小年纪竟是精光四射。另外一名则是身材瘦小，和他形成了鲜明的对比，整个人的身体甚至都有些佝偻着，但手臂却特别长，如果是站着的话，甚至快要能接近地面了。\n\n    “灵瞳，你认识新来的这个？”身材高大的男生问道。他并没有压抑自己的声音，周围很多桌都能听到。\n\n    “嗯，以前我们是同学。考核的时候他出了些意外，现在好了，就来了。”叶灵瞳说道。\n\n    “哦。他能力怎么样？”高大男生继续问道。\n\n    叶灵瞳停顿了一下，道：“我从来都没赢过他。”\n\n    “哦？”高大男生的眸光更亮了几分，看了一眼在那里盛饭的蓝轩宇背影，嘴角处勾勒出一丝微笑。\n\n
