她说的当然是实话。在他甩手一走，秀莲难为情地哭了以后，婆婆、公公和兰香劝说了她半天。公公还怒气冲冲地准备到饲养院来教训儿子，被兰香硬拉住了。 \n　　她临起身回来的时候，婆婆为了掩盖这个难堪的局面，硬让她把两个白面馍给少安带来，以便解脱儿媳妇。贤惠的婆婆原谅秀莲，虽然事情做得有失体统，但这不是儿媳妇自己贪嘴，而是她心疼他们的儿子哩！ \n　　但孙少安完全忍受不住了，他竟然一下子失去了理智，冲动地跳起来，在秀莲的肩膀上捣了一拳头！ \n　　秀莲完全想不到亲爱的丈夫会动手打她。在少安生硬的庄稼人的拳头落在她肩膀上的时候，手里的两个馍就滚在了前炕席上；她自己也一个趔趄，跌倒在了脚地上！ \n　　她伏在土脚地上，伤心地痛哭了。哭了一会，又猛烈地呕吐起来。 \n　　少安在打了秀莲以后，马上就后悔自己太粗暴了——秀莲不管怎样，都是为了心疼他，他怎么能动手打她呢！ \n　　他本来想下去劝说秀莲，并且向她认错道歉。但一时又克服不了男人的自尊心。他只好两把将铺盖绽开，衣服也没脱，烦恼地钻进被子里，蒙住了头。 \n　　过了一阵他听见秀莲不哭了，并且象上了炕，开始悉悉苏苏地脱衣服。 \n　　不一会，他觉得自己的被子的一边被拉开了，接着，那熟悉的、丰满的光身子就悄然地躺在了他身边。少安心里忍不住一热。 \n　　秀莲把脸贴在他背上，又委屈地啜泣起来。她一边哭，一边说：“你把人打得这么重……人家都有了……”“啊？”少安一下子翻过身来，紧紧地搂住了妻子，泪流满面地在她脸上狂吻起来…… \n                  第42章\n　　一九七七年元月中旬，孙少平要在原西县高中毕业了。 \n　　在最后的几天里，所有的毕业班都处在一片混乱之中。 \n　　同学们互赠礼物，整理自己的东西；单个照像，集体合影；要好的朋友也纷纷聚在一起照一张留念照。县照像馆干脆专门抽出几个人到中学来为同学们服务。 \n　　许多手头宽裕的学生，都一群一伙到街上的国营食堂去聚餐——那里的桌子板凳这几天都让这些年轻人占据了。这样的时候，同学们心里都有一种说不出的复杂感情。进校时盼着毕业的一天，可临近这一天的时候，又都有些依依不舍。更主要的是，所有的人都认识到，他们的少\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
