Have these folly-bound idiots ever thought once of me? Not once!\nBut that was not true. Hwi thought of him. She shared his torture.\nThese were thoughts of madness and he tried to put them away while his senses reported the soft movement of the guards and the flow of water beneath his chamber.\nWhen I made this choice, what were my expectations?\nHow the mob within laughed at that question! Did he not have a task to complete? Was that not the very essence of the agreement which kept the mob in check?\n“You have a task to complete,” they said. “You have but one purpose.”\nSingle purpose is the mark of the fanatic and! am not a fanatic!\n“You must be cynical and cruel. You cannot break the trust.”\nWhy not?\n“Who took that oath? You did. You chose this course.”\nExpectations!\n“The expectations which history creates for one generation are often shattered in the next generation. Who knows that better than you?”\nYes... and shattered expectations can alienate whole populations. | alone am a whole population!\n“Remember your oath!”\nIndeed. I am the disruptive force unleashed across the centuries. | limit expectations... including my own. | dampen the pendulum.\n“And then release it. Never forget that.”\nlam tired. Oh, how tired I am. If only | could sleep... really sleep.\n“You're full of self-pity, too.”\nWhy not? What am !? The ultimate loner forced to look at what might have been. Every day I look at it... and now. Hwi!\n“Your original unselfish choice fills you now with selfishness.”\nThere is danger all around. | must wear my selfishness like a suit of armor.\n“There’s danger for everyone who touches you. Isn't that your very nature?”\nDanger even for Hwi. Dear, delectable, dear Hwi.\n“Did you build high walls around you only to sit within them and indulge in self-pity?”\nThe walls were built because great forces have been unleashed in my Empire.\n“You unleashed them. Will you now compromise with them?”\nIt’s Hwi’s doing. These feelings have never before been this powerful in me. It’s the damnable Ixians!\n“How interesting that they should assault you with flesh rather than with a machine.”\nBecause they have discovered my secret.\n“You know the antidote.”\nLeto’s great body trembled through its entire length at this thought. He well knew the antidote which had always worked before: lose himself for a time in his own past. Not even the Bene Gesserit Sisters could take such safaris, striking inward along the axis of memories—back, back to the very limits of cellular awareness, or stopping by a wayside to revel in a sophisticated sensory delight. Once, after the death of a particularly superb Duncan, he had toured great musical performances preserved in his memories. Mozart had tired him quickly. Pretentious! But Bach... ahhh, Bach.\nLeto remembered the joy of it.\n| sat at the organ and let the music drench me.\nOnly three times in all memory had there been an equal to Bach. But even Licallo was not better, as good, but not better.\nWould female intellectuals be the proper choice for this night? Grandmother Jessica had been one of the best. Experience told him that someone as close to him as Jessica would not be the proper antidote for his present tensions. The search would have to venture much farther.\nHe imagined then describing such a safari to some awestruck visitor, a totally imaginary visitor because none would dare question him about such a holy matter.\n“I course backward down the flight of ancestors, hunting along the tributaries, darting into nooks and crannies. You would not recognize many of their names. Who has ever heard of Norma Cenva? | have lived her!”\n“Lived her?” his imaginary visitor asked.\n“Of course. Why else would one keep one’s ancestors around? You think a man designed the first Guild ship? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport? They lied. It was his mistress, Norma. She gave him the design, along with five children. He thought his ego would take no less. In the end, the knowledge that he had not really fulfilled his own image, that was what destroyed him.”\n“You have lived him, too?”\n“Naturally. And | have traversed the far wanderings of the Fremen. Through my father’s line and the others, | have gone right back to the House of Atreus.”\n“Such an illustrious line!”\n“With its fair share of fools.”\nDistraction is what | need, he thought.\nWould it be a tour through sexual dalliances and exploits, then?\n“You have no idea what internal orgies are available to me! | am the ultimate voyeur—participant(s) and\nobserver(s). Ignorance and misunderstandings about sexuality have caused so much distress. How abysmally narrow we have been—how miserly.”\nLeto knew he could not make that choice, not this night, not with Hwi out there in his City.\nWould he choose a review of warfare, then?\n“Which Napoleon was the greater coward?” he asked his imaginary visitor. “I will not reveal it, but | Know. Oh, yes, | know.”\nWhere can I go? With all of the past open to me, where can I go?\nThe brothels, the atrocities, the tyrants, the acrobats, nudists, surgeons, male whores, musicians, magicians, ungenciers, priests, artisans, priestesses...\n“Are you aware,” he asked his imaginary visitor, “that the hula preserves an ancient sign language which once belonged only to males? You’ve never heard of the hula? Of course. Who dances it anymore? Dancers have preserved many things, though. The translations have been lost, but | know them.\n“One whole night I was a series of caliphs moving eastward and westward with Islam—a traverse of centuries. | will not bore you with the details. Be gone now, visitor!”\nHow seductive it is, he thought, this call of the siren which would have me live only in the past.\nAnd how useless that past now, thanks to the damnable Ixians. How boring the past when Hwi is here. She would come to me right now if | summoned her. But I cannot call forher...notnow... not tonight.\nThe past continued to beckon.\n| could make a pilgrimage into my past. It does not have to be a safari. | could go alone. Pilgrimage purifies. Safaris make me into a tourist. That’s the difference. | could go alone into my inner world.\nAnd never return.\nLeto felt the inevitability of it, that the dream-state would eventually trap him.\n| create a special dream-state throughout my Empire. Within this dream, new myths form, new directions appear and new movements. New...new...new... The things emerge from my own dreams, out of my myths. Who more susceptible to them than I? The hunter is caught in his own net.\nLeto knew then that he had encountered a condition for which no antidote existed—past, present or future. His great body trembled and shivered in the gloom of his audience chamber.\nAt the portal, one Fish Speaker guard whispered to another: “Is God troubled?”\nAnd her companion replied: “The sins of this universe would trouble anyone.”\nLeto heard them and wept silently.\nWhen I set out to lead humankind along my Golden Path, | promised them a lesson their bones would remember. | Know a profound pattern which humans deny with their words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, the condition they call peace. Even as they speak, they create the seeds of turmoil and violence. If they find their quiet security, they squirm in it. How boring they find it. Look at them now. Look at what they do while I record these words. Hah! | give them enduring eons of enforced tranquility which plods on and on despite their every effort to escape into chaos. Believe me, the memory of Leto’s Peace shall abide with them forever. They will seek their quiet security thereafter only with extreme caution and steadfast preparation.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nM uch against his will, Idaho found himself at dawn with Siona beside him being taken to “a safe place” in an Imperial ornithopter. It raced eastward toward the golden arc of sunlight which lifted over a landscape carved into rectangular green plantations.\nThe ‘thopter was a big one, large enough to carry a small squad of Fish Speakers with their two guests. The pilot captain of the squad, a brawny woman with a face Idaho could believe had never smiled, had given her name as Inmeir. She sat in the pilot’s seat directly ahead of Idaho, two muscular Fish Speaker guards on either side of her. Five more guards sat behind Idaho and Siona.\n“God has ordered me to take you away from the City,” Inmeir had said, coming up to him in the command post beneath the central plaza. “It is for your own safety. We will return by tomorrow morning for Siaynoq.”\nIdaho, fatigued by a night of alarms, had sensed the futility of arguing against the orders of “God Himself.” Inmeir appeared quite capable of trundling him off under one of her thick arms. She had led him from the command\npost into a chilly night canopied with stars like stone-edged facets of shattered brilliants. It was only when they reached the ‘thopter and Idaho recognized Siona waiting there that\nhe had begun to question the purpose of this outing.\nDuring the night, Idaho had come to realize that not all of the violence in Onn had originated with the organized rebels. When he had inquired after Siona, Moneo had sent word that “my daughter is safely out of the way,” adding at the end of the message: “I commend her to your care.”\nIn the ‘thopter, Siona had not responded to Idaho’s questions. Even now, she sat in sullen silence beside him. She reminded him of himself in those first bitter days when he had vowed vengeance against the Harkonnens. He wondered at her bitterness. What drove her?\nWithout knowing why, Idaho found himself comparing Siona with Hwi Noree. It had not been easy to encounter Hwi, but he had managed it in spite of the importunate demands of Fish Speakers that he attend to duties elsewhere.\nGentle, that was the word for Hwi. She acted from a core of unchanging gentleness which was, in its own way, a thing of enormous power. He found this intensely attractive.\nI must see more of her.\nFor now, though, he had to contend with the sullen silence of Siona seated beside him. Well. . . silence could be met with silence.\nIdaho peered down at the passing landscape. Here and there he could see the clustered lights of villages winking out as the sunlight approached. The desert of the Sareer lay far behind and this was land that, by its appearance, might never have been parched.\nSome things do not change very much, he thought. They are merely taken from one place and reformed in another place.\nThis landscape reminded him of Caladan’s lush gardens and made him wonder what had become of the verdant\nplanet where the Atreides had lived for so many generations before coming to Dune. He could identify narrow roads, market roads with a scattered traffic of vehicles drawn by six-legged animals which he guessed were thorses. Moneo had said that thorses tailored\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_96f1515c094cee29c2dc4003afd20b29f57092c26db7f0c3a694faaec155644c_v2"}
