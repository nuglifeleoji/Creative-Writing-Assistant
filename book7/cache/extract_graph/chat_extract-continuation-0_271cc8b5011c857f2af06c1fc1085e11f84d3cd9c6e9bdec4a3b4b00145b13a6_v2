“两种说法都算对，也都有点不对，本来的目的地是这里的再过去一点。不过发现你的车子后，我就稍微改了一下下车的地点，因为我想带你来这里。”\n    “你把我带来这种地方，到底想怎样？”草S迅速扫视周遭一圈。\n   “我最后一次和石神交谈，就是在这里。当时我是对他这么说的：这个世上没有无用的齿轮，也只有齿轮本身能决定它的用途。”\n    “齿轮？”\n   “然后，我提出几个和命案有关的疑问问他。当时他虽然摆出不予置评的态度，但跟我分手后，他却做出了答复。那就是去自首。”\n    “你是说，他是听了你的话，才放弃挣扎去自首？”\n    “放弃挣扎……吗？也对，就某种角度而言或许的确是如此。不过对他来说，应该是打出了最后一张王牌，因为那张最后王牌，实在准备得非常周到。”\n    “你跟石神说了些什么？”\n    “我不是说了吗？就是齿轮的话题。”\n    “后来，你不是提出一些疑问？我是在问那个。”\n    汤川听了露出有点寂寞的笑容，轻飘飘地摇头晃脑。\n    “那个根本不重要。”\n    “不重要？”\n    “重要的是齿轮，他就是听到那个才决心自首的。”\n    草S大大叹了一口气。\n    “你去大学图书馆查过报纸吧？你的目的是什么？”\n    “是常磐告诉你的吗？看来你连我的行动都开始调查了。”\n    “其实我也不想这样做，谁叫你什么都不告诉我。”\n   “我没生气。那毕竟是你的工作，随便你要调查我还是做什么，我都无所谓。”\n    草S盯着汤川，然后低头求饶。\n   “拜托，你就别再吊我胃口了，你一定知道什么吧？请你告诉我。石神不是真凶吧？既然如此，你不觉得让他顶罪太没天理了吗？你总不希望昔日老友沦为杀人犯吧？”\n    “你把头抬起来。”\n    被汤川这么一说，草S抬眼看他，不禁赫然一惊。眼前那张物理学家的脸孔正痛苦地扭曲着，他抬手按着额头，紧紧闭着双眼。\n  “我当然也不希望他变成什么杀人犯，可是已经毫无办法了。连我都不知道怎么会变成这样……”\n    “喂，你干嘛这么痛苦。为什么不肯坦白告诉我，我们是朋友啊。”\n    汤川一听倏然睁眼，一脸严肃地说：“你是我的朋友，但同时也是刑警。”\n
