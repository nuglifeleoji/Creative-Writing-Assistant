先取之，足可为本。向者不克而还，盖因羌兵不至。今可先遣人会羌人于陇右，然后进兵出石营，从董亭直取南安。”维大喜曰：“公言甚妙！”遂遣郤正为使，赍金珠蜀锦入羌，结好羌王。羌王迷当，得了礼物，便起兵五万，令羌将俄何烧戈为大先锋，引兵南安来。\n\n    魏左将军郭淮闻报，飞奏洛阳。司马师问诸将曰：“谁敢去敌蜀兵？”辅国将军徐质曰：“某愿往。”师素知徐质英勇过人，心中大喜，即令徐质为先锋，令司马昭为大都督，领兵望陇西进发。军至董亭，正遇姜维，两军列成阵势。徐质使开出大斧，出马挑战。蜀阵中廖化出迎。战不数合，化拖刀败回。张翼纵马挺枪而迎，战不数合，又败入阵。徐质驱兵掩杀，蜀兵大败，退三十余里。司马昭亦收兵回，各自下寨。\n\n    姜维与夏侯霸商议曰：“徐质勇甚，当以何策擒之？”霸曰：“来日诈败，以埋伏之计胜之。”维曰：“司马昭乃仲达之子，岂不知兵法？若见地势掩映，必不肯追。吾见魏兵累次断吾粮道，今却用此计诱之，可斩徐质矣。”遂唤廖化分付如此如此，又唤张翼分付如此如此：二人领兵去了。一面令军士于路撒下铁蒺藜，寨外多排鹿角，示以久计。\n\n    徐质连日引兵搦战，蜀兵不出。哨马报司马昭说：“蜀兵在铁笼山后，用木牛流马搬运粮草，以为久计，只待羌兵策应。”昭唤徐质曰：“昔日所以胜蜀者，因断彼粮道也。今蜀兵在铁笼山后运粮，汝今夜引兵五千，断其粮道，蜀兵自退矣。”徐质领令，初更时分，引兵望铁笼山来，果见蜀兵二百余人，驱百余头木牛流马，装载粮草而行。魏兵一声喊起，徐质当先拦住。蜀兵尽弃粮草而走。质分兵一半，押送粮草回寨；自引兵一半追来。追不到十里，前面车仗横截去路。质令军士下马拆开车仗，只见两边忽然火起。质急勒马回走，后面山僻窄狭处，亦有车仗截路，火光迸起。质等冒烟突火，纵马而出。一声炮响，两路军杀来：左有廖化，右有张翼，大杀一阵，魏兵大败。\n\n    徐质奋死只身而走，人困马乏，正奔走间，前面一枝兵杀到，乃姜维也。质大惊无措，被维一枪刺倒座下马，徐质跌下马来，被众军乱刀砍死。质所\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GUO HUAI<|>PERSON<|>Guo Huai is
