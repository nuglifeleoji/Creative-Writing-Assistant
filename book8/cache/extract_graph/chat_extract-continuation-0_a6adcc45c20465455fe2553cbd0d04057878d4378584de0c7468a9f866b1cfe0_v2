 圆饼状的全天候魂导侦察机掠过海面缓缓行进，远处，已经可以见到白皑皑的雪线。\n\n    “所长，即将抵达极北之地。”清脆的声音响起，一身白色军装的南澄向坐在副机长位置的蓝潇报告。\n\n    他们是一支来自于斗罗联邦科学研究院天斗分院旗下的古魂兽研究所的科考队。自从斗罗联邦大约在九千年前完成了第一次太空之旅后，人类就开始了对太空不停的探索。不断的探索、不断的发现，让人类对宇宙的浩瀚有了越来越多的了解。\n\n    伴随着人口的增多以及一些其他问题，人类开始尝试星际移民。经过数千年的不懈努力，终于在一千多年前完成了第一颗行星的移民。之后千余年来，人类已经完成了对七颗行星的移民计划，并且开发。\n\n    自从万年前魂兽险些带来覆灭的灾难之后，被誉为斗罗联邦和平之母的那一代议长墨蓝宣布人类与魂兽和平共处。禁止一切对于魂兽的杀戮行为。\n\n    联邦在进行第三颗行星殖民的时候，就将这颗星球赠与了魂兽，由当代的数位魂兽之王带领，从小位面万兽台进行了大迁徙。魂兽终于有了属于自己的家园。\n\n    之后的第七颗行星，又赠予了魂兽。有了两颗属于自己的星球，魂兽在万年来得到了充分的休养生息，与人类之间的仇怨也彻底化解。人类正在以全新的方式和魂兽进行全面合作，数万年来，从魂兽占领着整个斗罗星人类挣扎求生，到人类发明魂导器，开始压缩魂兽的生存空间，再到万年前苏醒的魂兽之王带领着残存魂兽报复人类。如今，人类与魂兽和平共处。时代的变化，终于让因为魂师职业而密切相关的人类与魂兽，进入了和平发展时期。\n\n    蓝潇带领的这支科考队，就是前来极北之地探察，看看还有没有残留在这里的冰雪类魂兽，或者是魂兽遗迹，从而进行对古魂兽的研究。\n\n    极北之地曾经被誉为斗罗大陆最后一片净土，这里严酷的环境，才让残存的一些魂兽不被人类伤害。后来也同样进行了迁徙，但这里的魂兽世界自成一体，当时也耗费了很大力气才让绝大多数魂兽认可了移民。但还是有一些选择了留下来或者是隐藏起来。\n\n    “好。”蓝潇肩头挂着少校军衔，相貌英俊，他今年三十一岁，毕业于斗罗联邦国立科技学院，主攻魂兽研究。所有的科研单位全部授予军衔，由联邦统一管理。\n\n    一边答应着，他的目光不自觉的落在南澄军装下优美的曲线上，他们除了\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
