But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river.”\nThe Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the two Guildsmen.\n“Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling,” Paul said. “There are other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once they’ve used the spice liquor, the others no longer work.”\nThe old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward out of the crowd to Stand at the barrier lances.\n“Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,” Paul said. “It has been a long time since Caladan, hasn't it?”\nShe looked past him at his mother, said: “Well, Jessica, | see that your son is indeed the one. For that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your daughter.”\nPaul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: “You’ve never had the right or cause to forgive my mother anything!”\nThe old woman locked eyes with him.\n“Try your tricks on me, old witch,” Paul said. “Where’s your gom jabbar? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there staring out at you!”\nThe old woman dropped her gaze.\n“Have you nothing to say?” Paul demanded.\n“I welcomed you to the ranks of humans,” she muttered. “Don’t besmirch that.”\nPaul raised his voice: “Observe her, comrades! This is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the one person their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here | stand...But...I...will...qever...do...her... bidding!”\n“Jessica!” the old woman screamed. “Silence him!”\n“Silence him yourself,” Jessica said.\nPaul glared at the old woman. “For your part in all this | could gladly have you strangled,” he said. “You couldn’t prevent it!” he snapped as she stiffened in rage. “But | think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires.”\n“Jessica, what have you done?” the old woman demanded.\n“FIL give you only one thing,” Paul said. “You saw part of what the race needs, but how poorly you saw it. You think to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to your master plan! How little you understand of what—”\n“You mustn't speak of these things!” the old woman hissed.\n“Silence!” Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them\nunder Paul’s control.\nThe old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her, face blank with shock at the power with which he had seized her psyche. “Jessica,” she whispered. “Jessica.”\n“I remember your gom jabbar,” Paul said. “You remember mine. | can kill you with a word.”\nThe Fremen around the hall glanced knowingly at each other. Did the legend not say: “And his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against righteousness.”\nPaul turned his attention to the tall Princess Royal Standing beside her Emperor father. Keeping his eyes focused on her, he said: “Majesty, we both know the way out of our difficulty.”\nThe Emperor glanced at his daughter, back to Paul. “You dare? You! An adventurer without family, a nobody from—”\n“You've already admitted who | am,” Paul said. “Royal kinsman, you said. Let’s stop this nonsense.”\n“lam your ruler,” the Emperor said.\nPaul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment and facing him. One of them nodded.\n“I could force it,” Paul said.\n“You will not dare!” the Emperor grated.\nPaul merely stared at him.\nThe Princess Royal put a hand on her father’s arm. “Father,” she said, and her voice was silky soft, soothing.\n“Don’t try your tricks on me,” the Emperor said. He looked at her. “You don’t need to do this,\nDaughter. We’ve other resources that—”\n“But here’s a man fit to be your son,” she said.\nThe old Reverend Mother, her composure regained, forced her way to the Emperor’s side, leaned close to his ear and whispered.\n“She pleads your case,” Jessica said.\nPaul continued to look at the golden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother, he said: “That’s Irulan, the oldest, isn’t it?”\n“Yes,”\nChani moved up on Paul’s other side, said: “Do you wish me to leave, Muad’Dib?”\nHe glanced at her. “Leave? You'll never again leave my side.”\n“There’s nothing binding between us,” Chani said.\nPaul looked down at her for a silent moment, then: “Speak only truth with me, my Sihaya.” As she started to reply, he silenced her with a finger to her lips. “That which binds us cannot be loosed,” he said. “Now, watch these matters closely for | wish to see this room later through your wisdom.”\nThe Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a heated, low-voiced argument.\nPaul spoke to his mother: “She reminds him that it’s part of their agreement to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne, and Irulan is the one they’ve groomed for it.”\n“Was that their plan?” Jessica said.\n“Isn't it obvious?” Paul asked.\n“I see the signs!” Jessica snapped. “My question was meant to remind you that you should not try to teach me those matters in which | instructed you.”\nPaul glanced at her, caught a cold smile on her lips.\nGurney Halleck leaned between them, said: “l remind you, m’Lord, that there’s a Harkonnen in that bunch.” He nodded toward the dark-haired Feyd- Rautha pressed against a barrier lance on the left. “The one with the squinting eyes there on the left. As evil a face as | ever say. You promised me once that\n“Thank you, Gurney,” Paul said.\n“It’s the na-Baron...Baron now that the old man’s dead,” Gurney said. “He’ll do for what I’ve in—”\n“Can you take him, Gurney?”\n“M’Lord jests!”\n“That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough, don’t you think, Mother?”\nShe nodded. “Indeed.”\nPaul raised his voice, called out to the Emperor: “Majesty, is there a Harkonnen among you?”\nRoyal disdain revealed itself in the way the Emperor turned to look at Paul. “I believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal word,” he said.\n“My question was for information only,” Paul said. “I wish to know if a Harkonnen is officially a part of your entourage or if a Harkonnen is merely hiding behind a technicality out of cowardice.”\nThe Emperor’s smile was calculating. “Anyone accepted into the Imperial company is a member of my entourage.”\n“You have the word of a Duke,” Paul said, “but Muad’Dib is another matter. He may not recognize your definition of what constitutes an entourage. My friend Gurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen. If he—”\n“Kanly!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. He pressed against the barrier lance. “Your father named this vendetta, Atreides. You call me coward while you hide among your women and offer to send a lackey against me!”\nThe old Truthsayer whispered something fiercely into the Emperor’s ear, but he pushed her aside, said: “Kanly, is it? There are strict rules for kanly.”\n“Paul, put a stop to this,” Jessica said.\n“M’Lord,” Gurney said, “you promised me my day against the Harkonnens.”\n“You’ve had your day against them,” Paul said and he felt a harlequin abandon take over his emotions. He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders, handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife, began unstrapping his stillsuit. He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment.\n“There’s no need for this,” Jessica said. “There are easier ways, Paul.”\nPaul stepped out of his stillsuit, slipped the crysknife from its sheath in his mother’s hand. “l know,” he said. “Poison, an assassin, all the old familiar ways.”\n“You promised me a Harkonnen!” Gurney hissed, and Paul marked the rage in the man’s face, the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridged. “You owe it to me, m’Lord!”\n“Have you suffered more from them than I?” Paul asked.\n“My sister,” Gurney rasped. “My years in the slave pits—”\n“My father,” Paul said. “My good friends and companions, Thufir Hawat and Duncan Idaho, my years as a fugitive without rank or succor...and one more thing: it is now kanly and you know as well as | the rules that must prevail.”\nHalleck’s shoulders sagged. “M’Lord, if that swine...he’s no more than a beast you’d spurn with your foot and discard the shoe because it’d been contaminated. Call in an executioner, if you must, or let me do it, but don’t offer yourself to—”\n“Muad’Dib need not do this thing,” Chani said.\nHe glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes. “But the Duke Paul must,” he said.\n“This ts a Harkonnen animal!” Gurney rasped. Paul hesitated on the point of revealing his own Harkonnen ancestry, stopped at a sharp look from his mother, said merely: “But this being has human\nShape, Gurney, and deserves human doubt.”\nGurney said: “If he so much as—”\n“Please stand aside,” Paul said. He hefted the crysknife, pushed Gurney gently aside.\n“Gurney!” Jessica said. She touched Gurney’s arm. “He’s like his grandfather in this mood. Don’t distract him. It’s the only thing you can do for him now.” And she thought: Great Mother! What irony.\nThe Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha, seeing the heavy shoulders, the thick muscles. He turned to look at Paul—a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as\ndesiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin.\nJessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: “One thing, Son. Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit, a word implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods. The word-sound most frequently used is Uroshnor. If this one’s been prepared, as | strongly suspect, that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid and—”\n“I want no special advantage for this one,” Paul said. “Step back out of my way.”\nGurney spoke to her: “Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds his reason?”\nJessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why Paul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the", " flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin.\nJessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: “One thing, Son.

Does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds his reason?”\nJessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why Paul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the changed Paul was capable of such a thing as Gurney suggested. Every talent within her focused on the need to protect her son, but there was nothing she could do.\n“Is it this religious prattle?” Gurney insisted.\n“Be silent,” Jessica whispered. “And pray.”\nThe Emperor’s face was touched by an abrupt smile. “If Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen...of my entourage...so wishes,” he said, “I relieve him of all restraint and give him freedom to choose his own course in this.” The Emperor waved a hand toward\nPaul’s Fedaykin guards. “One of your rabble has my belt and short blade. If Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may meet you with my blade in his hand.”\n“I wish it,” Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man’s face.\nHe’s overconfident, Paul thought. There’s a natural advantage I can accept.\n“Get the Emperor’s blade,” Paul said, and watched as his command was obeyed. “Put it on the floor there.” He indicated a place with his foot. “Clear the Imperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear.”\nA flurry of robes, scraping of feet, low-voiced commands and protests accompanied obedience to Paul’s command. The Guildsmen remained standing near the communications equipment. They frowned at Paul in obvious indecision.\nThey’re accustomed to seeing the future, Paul thought. /n this place and time they’re blind...even as / am. And he sampled the time-winds, sensing the turmoil, the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place. Even the faint gaps were closed now. Here was the unborn jihad, he knew. Here was the race consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose. Here was reason enough for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Lisan al-Gaib or even the halting schemes of the Bene Gesserit. The race of humans had felt its own dormancy, sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in which the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans were alive as an unconscious single organism in this\nmoment, experiencing a kind of sexual heat that could override any barrier.\nAnd Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit of this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the jihad would be. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him. They needed only the legend he already had become. He had shown them the way, given them mastery even over the Guild which must have the spice to exist.\nA sense of failure pervaded him, and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform, stripped down to a fighting girdle with a mail core.\nThis is the climax, Paul thought. From here, the future will open, the clouds part onto a kind of glory. And if I die here, they'll say | sacrificed myself that my spirit might lead them. And if I live, they'll say nothing can oppose Muad’Dib.\n“Is the Atreides ready?” Feyd-Rautha called, using the words of the ancient kanly ritual.\nPaul chose to answer him in the Fremen way: “May thy knife chip and shatter!” He pointed to the Emperor’s blade on the floor, indicating that Feyd- Rautha should advance and take it.\nKeeping his attention on Paul, Feyd-Rautha picked up the knife, balancing it a moment in his hand to get the feel of it. Excitement kindled in him. This was a fight he had dreamed about—man against man, skill against skill with no shields intervening. He could see a way to power opening before him because the Emperor surely would reward whoever killed this\ntroublesome Duke. The reward might even be that haughty daughter and a share of the throne. And this yokel Duke, this back-world adventurer could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen trained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats. And the yokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here.\nLet us see if you’re proof against poison! Feyd- Rautha thought. He saluted Paul with the Emperor’s blade, said: “Meet your death, fool.”\n“Shall we fight, cousin?” Paul asked. And he cat- footed forward, eyes on the waiting blade, his body crouched low with his own milk-white crysknife pointing out as though an extension of his arm.\nThey circled each other, bare feet grating on the floor, watching with eyes intent for the slightest opening.\n“How beautifully you dance,” Feyd-Rautha said.\nHe’s a talker, Paul thought. There’s another weakness. He grows uneasy in the face of silence.\n“Have you been shriven?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\nStill, Paul circled in silence.\nAnd the old Reverend Mother, watching the fight from the press of the Emperor’s suite, felt herself trembling. The Atreides youth had called the Harkonnen cousin. It could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared, easy to understand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words forced her to focus on the only thing that mattered to her here.\nThis could be a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme.\nShe had seen something of what Paul had seen here, that Feyd-Rautha might kill but not be victorious. Another thought, though, almost overwhelmed her. Two end products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the death that might easily claim both of them. If both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha’s bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured factor, and Alia, the abomination.\n“Perhaps you have only pagan rites here,” Feyd- Rautha said. “Would you like the Emperor’s Truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey?”\nPaul smiled, circling to the right, alert, his black thoughts suppressed by the needs of the moment.\nFeyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in a blur to his left hand.\nPaul dodged easily, noting the shield-conditioned hesitation in Feyd-Rautha’s thrust. Still, it was not as great a shield conditioning as some Paul had seen, and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded foes.\n“Does an Atreides run or stand and fight?” Feyd- Rautha asked.\nPaul resumed his silent circling. Idaho’s words came back to him, the words of training from the long-ago practice floor on Caladan: “Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.”\n“Perhaps you think this dance prolongs your life a few moments,” Feyd-Rautha said. “Well and good.”\nHe stopped the circling, straightened.\nPaul had seen enough for a first approximation. Feyd-Rautha led to the left side, presenting the right hip as though the mailed fighting girdle could protect his entire side. It was the action of a man trained to the shield and with a knife in both hands.\nOr...And Paul hesitated.... the girdle was more than it seemed.\nThe Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who'd this day led the forces of victory against Sardaukar legions.\nFeyd-Rautha noted the hesitation, said: “Why prolong the inevitable? You but keep me from exercising my rights over this ball of dirt.”\nIf it’s a flio-dart, Paul thought, it’s a cunning one. The girdle shows no signs of tampering.\n“Why don’t you speak?” Feyd-Rautha demanded.\nPaul resumed his probing circle, allowing himself a cold smile at the tone of unease in Feyd-Rautha’s voice, evidence that the pressure of silence was building.\n“You smile, eh?” Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in midsentence.\nExpecting the slight hesitation, Paul almost failed to evade the downflash of blade, felt its tip scratch his left arm. He silenced the sudden pain there, his mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick—an overfeint. Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There would be tricks within tricks within tricks.\n“Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my Skills,” Feyd-Rautha said. “He gave me first blood. Too\nbad the old fool didn’t live to see it.”\nAnd Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, “Expect only what happens in the fight. That way you'll never be surprised.”\nAgain the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.\nPaul saw the return of elation to his opponent, wondered at it. Did a scratch signify that much to the man? Unless there were poison on the blade! But how could there be? His own men had handled the weapon, snooped it before passing it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that.\n“That woman you were talking to over there,” Feyd-Rautha said. “The little one. Is she something Special to you? A pet perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions?”\nPaul remained silent, probing with his inner senses, examining the blood from the wound, finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor’s blade. He realigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the molecules of the soporific, but he felt a thrill of doubt. They’d been prepared with soporific on a blade. A soporific. Nothing to alert a poison Snooper, but strong enough to slow the muscles it touched. His enemies had their own plans within plans, their own stacked treacheries.\nAgain Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.\nPaul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with Slowness as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing arm on the crysknife’s point.\nFeyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to his left hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him.\nLet him know his own moment of doubt, Paul thought. Let him suspect poison.\n“Treachery!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. “He’s poisoned me! | do feel poison in my arm!”\nPaul dropped his cloak of silence, said: “Only a little acid to counter the soporific on the Emperor’s blade.”\nFeyd-Rautha matched Paul’s cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute. His eyes", " treacheries.\nAgain Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.\nPaul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with Slowness as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing arm on the crysknife’s point.\nFeyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to his left hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him.\nLet him know his own moment of doubt, Paul thought. Let him suspect poison.\n“Treachery!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. “He’s poisoned me! | do feel poison in my arm!”\nPaul dropped his cloak of silence, said: “Only a little acid to counter the soporific on the Emperor’s blade.”\nFeyd-Rautha matched Paul’s cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute. His eyes glared rage behind the knife.\nPaul shifted his crysknife to his left hand, matching his opponent. Again, they circled, probing.\nFeyd-Rautha began closing the space between them, edging in, knife held high, anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw. He feinted right and under, and they were pressed against each other, knife hands gripped, straining.\nPaul, cautious of Feyd-Rautha’s right hip where he Suspected a poison flip-dart, forced the turn to the right. He almost failed to see the needle point flick out beneath the belt line. A shift and a giving in Feyd- Rautha’s motion warned him. The tiny point missed Paul’s flesh by the barest fraction.\nOn the left hip!\nTreachery within treachery within treachery, Paul reminded himself. Using Bene Gesserit-trained muscles, he sagged to catch a reflex in Feyd-Rautha, but the necessity of avoiding the tiny point jutting\nfrom his opponent’s hip threw Paul off just enough that he missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to the floor, Feyd-Rautha on top.\n“You see it there on my hip?” Feyd-Rautha whispered. “Your death, fool.” And he began twisting himself around, forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer. “It’ll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you. There’ll be never a trace left to detect!”\nPaul strained, hearing the silent screams in his mind, his cell-stamped ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to save himself.\n“I will not say it!” Paul gasped.\nFeyd-Rautha gaped at him, caught in the merest fraction of hesitation. It was enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponent’s leg muscles, and their positions were reversed. Feyd- Rautha lay partly underneath with right hip high, unable to turn because of the tiny needle point caught against the floor beneath him.\nPaul twisted his left hand free, aided by the lubrication of blood from his arm, thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha’s Jaw. The point slid home into the brain. Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back, still held partly on his side by the needle imbedded in the floor.\nBreathing deeply to restore his calm, Paul pushed himself away and got to his feet. He stood over the body, knife in hand, raised his eyes with deliberate Slowness to look across the room at the Emperor.\n“Majesty,” Paul said, “your force is reduced by one more. Shall we now shed sham and pretense? Shall\nwe now discuss what must be? Your daughter wed to me and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne.”\nThe Emperor turned, looked at Count Fenring. The Count met his stare—gray eyes against green. The thought lay there clearly between them, their association so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance.\nKill this upstart for me, the Emperor was saying. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now...you know the way of it. Kill him.\nSlowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.\n“Do it!” the Emperor hissed.\nThe Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in the Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this Atreides youth.\n/ could kill him, Fenring thought—and he knew this for a truth.\nSomething in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he glimpsed briefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul—a way of hiding from the youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate.\nPaul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled, understood at last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of prescience. Fenring was one of the might-have-beens, an almost-Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern—\na eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion. A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced.\nFenring, reading Paul’s emotion, said, “Majesty, | must refuse.”\nRage overcame Shaddam IV. He took two short steps through the entourage, cuffed Fenring viciously across the jaw.\nA dark flush spread up and over the Count’s face. He looked directly at the Emperor, spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis: “We have been friends, Majesty. What | do now is out of friendship. | shall forget that you struck me.”\nPaul cleared his throat, said: “We were speaking of the throne, Majesty.”\nThe Emperor whirled, glared at Paul. “I sit on the throne!” he barked.\n“You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus,” Paul said.\n“| put down my arms and came here on your word of bond!” the Emperor shouted. “You dare threaten\n“Your person is safe in my presence,” Paul said. “An Atreides promised it. Muad’Dib, however, sentences you to your prison planet. But have no fear, Majesty. | will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my disposal. It shall become a garden world, full of gentle things.”\nAs the hidden import of Paul’s words grew in the Emperor’s mind, he glared across the room at Paul. “Now we see true motives,” he sneered.\n“Indeed,” Paul said.\n“And what of Arrakis?” the Emperor asked. “Another garden world full of gentle things?”\n“The Fremen have the word of Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “There will be flowing water here open to the Sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis...and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: ‘God created Arrakis to train the faithful.” One cannot go against the word of God.”\nThe old Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her own view of the hidden meaning in Paul’s words now. She glimpsed the jihad and said: “You cannot loose these people upon the universe!”\n“You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar!” Paul snapped.\n“You cannot,” she whispered.\n“You're a Truthsayer,” Paul said. “Review your words.” He glanced at the Princess Royal, back to the Emperor. “Best be done quickly, Majesty.”\nThe Emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter. She touched his arm, spoke soothingly: “For this | was trained, Father.”\nHe took a deep breath.\n“You cannot stay this thing,” the old Truthsayer muttered.\nThe Emperor straightened, standing stiffly with a look of remembered dignity. “Who will negotiate for you, kinsman?” he asked.\nPaul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy- lidded, standing with Chani in a squad of Fedaykin guards. He crossed to them, stood looking down at Chani.\n“I know the reasons,” Chani whispered. “If it must be...Usul.”\nPaul, hearing the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. “My Sihaya need fear nothing, ever,” he whispered. He dropped his arm, faced his mother. “You will negotiate for me, Mother, with Chani by your side. She has wisdom and sharp eyes. And it is wisely said that no one bargains tougher than a Fremen. She will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of her sons to be, what they will need. Listen to her.”\nJessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son, put down a shudder. “What are your instructions?” she asked.\n“The Emperor’s entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry,” he said.\n“Entire?” She was shocked almost speechless.\n“He is to be stripped. l'Il want an earldom and CHOAM directorship for Gurney Halleck, and him in the fief of Caladan. There will be titles and attendant power for every surviving Atreides man, not excepting the lowliest trooper.”\n“What of the Fremen?” Jessica asked.\n“The Fremen are mine,” Paul said. “What they receive shall be dispensed by Muad’Dib. It’ll begin with Stilgar as Governor on Arrakis, but that can wait.”\n“And for me?” Jessica asked.\n“Is there something you wish?”\n“Perhaps Caladan,” she said, looking at Gurney. “I’m not certain. I’ve become too much the Fremen... and the Reverend Mother. | need a time of peace and stillness in which to think.”\n“That you shall have,” Paul said, “and anything else that Gurney or | can give you.”\nJessica nodded, feeling suddenly old and tired. She looked at Chani. “And for the royal concubine?”\n“No title for me,” Chani whispered. “Nothing. | beg of you.”\nPaul stared down into her eyes, remembering her suddenly as she had stood once with little Leto in her arms, their child now dead in this violence. “I Swear to you now,” he whispered, “that you’ll need no title. That woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing and we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the Landsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of desire.”\n“So you say now,” Chani said. She glanced across the room at the tall princess.\n“Do you know so little of my son?” Jessica whispered. “See that princess standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else.” A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. “Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine—never to know a moment of tenderness\nfrom the man to whom she’s bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine—history will call us Wives.”\nAPPENDIXES\nAPPENDIX I: THE ECOLOGY OF DUNE\nBeyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase.
