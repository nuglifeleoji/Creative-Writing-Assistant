袁公路结亲，诸侯保无有嫉妒者乎？”若复远择吉期，或竟乘我良辰，伏兵半路以夺之，如之奈何？为今之计：不许便休；既已许之。当趁诸侯未知之时，即便送女到寿春，另居别馆，然后择吉成亲，万无一失也。”布喜曰：“公台之言甚当。”遂入告严氏。连夜具办妆奁，收拾宝马香车，令宋宪、魏续一同韩胤送女前去。鼓乐喧天，送出城外。\n\n    时陈元龙之父陈珪，养老在家，闻鼓乐之声，遂问左右。左右告以故。珪曰：“此乃疏不间亲之计也。玄德危矣。”遂扶病来见吕布。布曰：“大夫何来？”珪曰：“闻将军死至，特来吊丧。”布惊曰：“何出此言？”珪曰：“前者袁公路以金帛送公，欲杀刘玄德，而公以射戟解之；今忽来求亲，其意盖欲以公女为质，随后就来攻玄德而取小沛。小沛亡，徐州危矣。且彼或来借粮，或来借兵：公若应之，是疲于奔命，而又结怨于人；若其不允，是弃亲而启兵端也。况闻袁术有称帝之意，是造反也。彼若造反，则公乃反贼亲属矣，得无为天下所不容乎？”布大惊曰：“陈宫误我！”急命张辽引兵，追赶至三十里之外，将女抢归；连韩胤都拿回监禁，不放归去。却令人回复袁术，只说女儿妆奁未备，俟备毕便自送来。陈珪又说吕布，使解韩胤赴许都。布犹豫未决。\n\n    忽人报：“玄德在小沛招军买马，不知何意。”布曰：“此为将者本分事，何足为怪。”正话间，宋宪、魏续至，告布曰：“我二人奉明公之命，往山东买马，买得好马三百余匹；回至沛县界首，被强寇劫去一半。打听得是刘备之弟张飞，诈妆出贼，抢劫马匹去了。”吕布听了大怒，随即点兵往小沛来斗张飞。玄德闻知大惊，慌忙领兵出迎。两阵圆处，玄德出马曰：“兄长何故领兵到此？”布指骂曰：“我辕门射戟，救你大难，你何故夺我马匹？”玄德曰：“备因缺马，令人四下收买，安敢夺兄马匹。”布曰：你便使张飞夺了我好马一百五十匹，尚自抵赖！”张飞挺枪出马曰：“是我夺了你好马！你今待怎么？”布骂曰：“环眼贼！你累次渺视我！”飞曰：“我夺你马你便恼，你夺我哥哥的徐州便不说了！”布挺戟出马来战张飞，飞亦挺枪来迎。两个酣战一百余合，未见胜负。玄德恐有疏失，急鸣金收军入城。吕布分军四面围定。玄德唤张飞\n######################\nOutput:",
