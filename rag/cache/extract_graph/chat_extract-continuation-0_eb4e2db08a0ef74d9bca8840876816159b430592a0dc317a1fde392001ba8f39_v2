Hawat said—”\n“It was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.”\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: ^“... defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n“Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,” he said. “That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.”\n“The Shadout Mapes,” Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. “A summons from your father to—”\n“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe relaxed slightly.\nBut Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.\nPaul spoke matter-of-factly: “It’s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them.”\nA rapping sounded at the airlock door—the code knock of one of Hawat’s corps.\n“Come in,” Paul called.\nThe door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room. “There you are, sir,” he said. “The housekeeper said you'd be here.” He glanced around the room. “We found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console.”\n“I'll want to take part in the interrogation,” Jessica said.\n“Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.”\n“Nothing to identify him?” she asked.\n“We've found nothing yet, my Lady.”\n“Was he an Arrakeen native?” Paul asked.\nJessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.\n“He has the native look,” the man said. “Put into that cairn more’n a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday. l'Il stake my reputation on it.”\n“No one questions your thoroughness,” Jessica said.\n“I question it, my Lady. We should’ve used sonic probes down there.”\n“|I presume that’s what you’re doing now,” Paul said.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Send word to my father that we'll be delayed.”\n“At once, sir.” He glanced at Jessica. “It’s Hawat’s order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.” Again, his eyes swept the room. “What of this place?”\n“I’ve reason to believe it safe,” she said. “Both Hawat and I have inspected it.”\n“Then l'Il mount guard outside here, m’Lady, until we've been over the house once more.” He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door closed behind him.\nPaul broke the sudden silence, saying: “Had we better go over the house later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss.”\n“This wing was the only place | hadn’t examined,” She said. “I put it off to last because....”\n“Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,” he said.\nShe darted a quick look at his face, questioning.\n“Do you distrust Hawat?” she asked.\n“No, but he’s getting old...he’s overworked. We could take some of the load from him.”\n“That'd only shame him and impair his efficiency,” She said. “A stray insect won’t be able to wander into\nthis wing after he hears about this. He’ll be shamed that....”\n“We must take our own measures,” he said.\n“Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,” she said. “He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him...many times over.”\nPaul said: “When my father is bothered by something you’ve done he says ‘Bene Gesserit!’ like a swear word.”\n“And what is it about me that bothers your father?”\n“When you argue with him.”\n“You are not your father, Paul.”\nAnd Paul thought: /t’// worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.\n“What're you holding back?” Jessica asked. “This isn’t like you, Paul.”\nHe shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.\nAnd Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.\n“My father must learn of this at once,” he said. “I'll radiograph it in code and get it off.”\n“No,” she said. “You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it.”\n“Do you mean we should trust no one?”\n“There’s another possibility,” she said. “This message may have been meant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it’s true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.”\nPaul’s face remained sturdily somber. “To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way,” he said.\n“You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it,” she said.\n“I understand.”\nShe turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking—a yellowed ball above the cliffs.\nPaul turned with her, said: “I don’t think it’s Hawat, either. Is it possible it’s Yueh?”\n“He’s not a lieutenant or companion,” she said. “And | can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.”\nPaul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn’t be Gurney...or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible. They're all from families that’ve been loyal to us for generations —for good reason.\nJessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here! She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard— lines of spice silos in it with stilt-legged watchtowers Standing around it like so many startled spiders. She could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall—silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.\nSlowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear,\nprecise rhythm—a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink- blink-blink...\nPaul stirred beside her in the dusky room.\nBut Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.\nSomeone signaling!\nShe tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.\nOther lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff—very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!\nAnd it was gone.\nThe false star in the cliff winked out immediately.\nSignals...and they filled her with premonition.\nWhy were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why couldn’t they use the communications network?\nThe answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemies—between Harkonnen agents.\nThere came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat’s man: “All clear, sir...m’Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his father.”\nIt is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet\nof the landing control tower outside Arrakeen. The night’s first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze—yellow...white...blue.\nHe thought of the notices posted now above his Signature all through the populous places of the planet: “Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.”\nThe ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis... and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe rage was difficult to suppress.\nHe saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawat’s lieutenant.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nHe shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries.\nBetter a cautious delay than...\nThe lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.\n“Our Sublime Padishah Emperor....”\nIf the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor’s private note to his “Noble Duke”—the disdainful allusions to veiled men and women: “...but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?”\nThe Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles Caladan...but l'Il never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. | may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—\n“My lungs taste the air of Time Blown past falling sands....”\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert—barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HAWAT<|>PERSON<|>Hawat is a trusted lieutenant serving three generations of Atreides, responsible for security and investigations\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and mother of Paul, involved in security decisions and political maneuvering\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is the son of Duke Leto Atreides, showing astuteness and leadership potential\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>PERSON<|>The Duke is the ruler of House Atreides, currently on Arrakis, facing political and security challenges\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHADOUT MAPES<|>PERSON<|>A housekeeper who delivered a warning about a traitor\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rival house responsible for attacks on the Atreides\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>A desert planet where House Atreides has been assigned, rich in spice but fraught with danger\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>GEO<|>The capital city of Arrakis where the Atreides reside\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHIELD WALL<|>GEO<|>Cliffs near Arrakeen, a strategic location on Arrakis\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>The former home planet of House Atreides, now longed for by the Duke\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTER-SEEKER ATTACK<|>EVENT<|>An assassination attempt using a hunter-seeker device\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HOSTAGE EXCHANGE<|>EVENT<|>A negotiation involving hostages and financial transfers\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>PAUL<|>Jessica is Paul's mother and advises him on security and political matters<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>Paul is the son of Duke Leto and shares his concerns about security<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HAWAT<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>Hawat serves Duke Leto as a trusted security officer<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>HAWAT<|>Jessica and Hawat collaborate on security inspections and trust each other<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>The Harkonnens are enemies of House Atreides and have attempted assassinations<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>HARKONNENS<|>Paul is a target of Harkonnen assassination attempts<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Duke has been assigned to rule Arrakis but longs for Caladan<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>SHADOUT MAPES<|>Jessica received a warning from Shadout Mapes about a traitor<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SHADOUT MAPES<|>Paul interacted with Shadout Mapes and learned of a possible traitor<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER-SEEKER ATTACK<|>HARKONNENS<|>The hunter-seeker attack was likely orchestrated by the Harkonnens<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HUNTER-SEEKER ATTACK<|>PAUL<|>Paul was the target of the hunter-seeker attack<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO ATREIDES<|>CALADAN<|>The Duke misses his home planet of Caladan<|>7\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
