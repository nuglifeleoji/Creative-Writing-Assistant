闻言，亦不开口，伸颈就刑。众皆下泪。操以棺椁盛其尸，葬于许都。后人有诗叹之曰：“生死无二志，丈夫何壮哉！不从金石论，空负栋梁材。辅主真堪敬，辞亲实可哀。白门身死日，谁肯似公台！”\n\n    方操送宫下楼时，布告玄德曰：“公为坐上客，布为阶下囚，何不发一言而相宽乎？”玄德点头。及操上楼来，布叫曰：“明公所患，不过于布；布今已服矣。公为大将，布副之，天下不难定也。”操回顾玄德曰！“何如？”玄德答曰：“公不见丁建阳、董卓之事乎？”布目视玄德曰：“是儿最无信者！”操令牵下楼缢之。布回顾玄德曰：“大耳儿！不记辕门射戟时耶？”忽一人大叫曰：“吕布匹夫！死则死耳，何惧之有！”众视之，乃刀斧手拥张辽至。操令将吕布缢死，然后枭首。后人有诗叹曰：“洪水滔滔淹下邳，当年吕布受擒时：空余赤兔马千里，漫有方天戟一枝。缚虎望宽今太懦，养鹰休饱昔无疑。恋妻不纳陈宫谏，枉骂无恩大耳儿。”又有诗论玄德曰：“伤人饿虎缚体宽，董卓丁原血未干。玄德既知能啖父，争如留取害曹瞒？”却说武士拥张辽至。操指辽曰：“这人好生面善。”辽曰：“濮阳城中曾相遇，如何忘却？”操笑曰：“你原来也记得！”辽曰：“只是可惜！”操曰：“可惜甚的？”辽曰：“可惜当日火不大，不曾烧死你这国贼！”操大怒曰：“败将安敢辱吾！”拔剑在手，亲自来杀张辽。辽全无惧色，引颈待杀。曹操背后一人攀住臂膊，一人跪于面前，说道：“丞相且莫动手！”正是：乞哀吕布无人救，骂贼张辽反得生。毕竟救张辽的是谁，且听下文分解。\n\n\n\n第二十回
