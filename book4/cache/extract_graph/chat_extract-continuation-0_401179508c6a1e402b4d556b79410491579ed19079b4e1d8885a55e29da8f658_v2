九五九年就把荷马踩倒在脚下！全国都实行了“食堂”制，人们“各取所需”，随吃随拿，喜气洋洋地踏进了光辉的“共产主义社会”。不过，据说上层还在争论：是先让“老大哥”苏联进入共产主义社会呢，还是我国先宣布已经进入了共产主义社会？ \n　　当然，“结论”还没有得出，中国不久就进入了骇人听闻的三年困难时期，饿死了许多人。在以后著名的七千人大会上，据说发动这场“运动”的毛泽东主席做了检查。遗撼的是，这位中国历史上划时代的伟大老人，并没有记取这个教训，以后又一错再错，从一九六六年开始导致了中国更大规模的混乱，使得整个国家陷入了痛苦与绝望的深渊……就在那个大跃进年头，离省城六十公里的某地区，决心放一颗大“卫星”：在位于中部平原和南部峻岭间的黑龙河上，修建本省最大的水库。其气势之大，令人咋舌。全区动用了两万民工，费时一年零四个月，动用一千万方上，在这个浅山区修起了占地一万二千亩的“跃进”水库。水库要淹没许多村庄，牵扯两个公社的几千人口。于是，只能把这些人撤出，另寻安插之地。 \n　　但这几千农业人口的大迁徒决非易事。平原地区本来人口就已爆满，哪里愿意接受这些占地吃粮的人呢？而这些祖辈生活在浅山区的人又宁死也不进入贫瘠的南部大山之中。经劝说和强迫相结合，好不容易才将这些人疏散到了几百里路以外的铜城地区——那里有一个自然环境看起来与此地差不多的无人区。 \n　　当时这些人迁徒他乡的场面十分悲惨。几千人哭声恸地，喊声震天。是啊，这里是他们不知生息了多少辈的故土；现在，他们自己连同祖先的骨头都要搬到一个陌生而荒僻的地方了。不久，这里的一切将要永远地埋葬于深水之下！ \n　　但他们无法抗拒残酷的现实，立刻被汽车和火车拉到了远方的“新垦区”。初到异地的几年里，由于不服水土，有一百多位老人相继离开了人世。这是一场人为的大悲剧！至于那个劳民伤财的“跃进”水库，好景不长。没多久，山洪过后所沉积下的淤泥开始逐渐把这个水库变成了一座土坝。到七十年代中期，库区完全淤成了平地。滚滚地黑龙河拦挡不住，它带着嘲弄人的哗哗声响，依然如脱缰的野马，从旁择道而继续往北方的平原上奔腾远去，丝毫也没有放慢奔向黄河与大海的步伐。 \n　　这时候，根据新的行政区划，水库所在地的区域归属了省会所在市。市上决定，在这个一万二千亩的坝地上建立一个国营农场，职工逐\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>中国<|>GEO<|>China is a country that
