在涨价，而砖瓦一直供不应求！尤其是宝贵的钢材，就象困难时期的营养品一样，受到了严格的控制。越是控制，越是紧缺，漏洞也就越多；各种后门洞开，许多环节上都有不法之徒大发横财——报纸上不时报道有贪财的官员锒铛入狱！ \n　　孙少安开办砖厂，的确赶上了当口——他不愁他的砖没有销路。 \n　　但是，要把每一块砖变成人民币，还得要费一番周折喽！如果按当时通行的价格，那倒很省心——起先他就是这样把砖卖掉的。可是有一次，他碰见“夸富”会上和他住同屋的“冒尖户”胡永合，把他这种便当的买卖大大嘲笑了一番。 \n　　胡永合告诉他，现在的买卖人没他这号瓷脑！他教导孙少安说：脑筋放活些！你把买方的人请到食堂里吃上一顿，每块砖就能多卖一二厘钱！ \n　　孙少安大为惊讶。他先把这位“传教士”请到原西县国营食堂吃了一顿。这顿饭使两个买卖人成了朋友。三杯酒下肚，生意油子胡永合又给他传授了不少窍道。 \n　　打这以后，孙少安就“灵醒”多了。按胡永合的教导试了一回，果真灵验——原来一块砖最多卖三分八厘钱，这次卖了三分九厘。一块砖多卖一厘钱，那就是一笔不小的款项；请一两个人吃顿饭能花几个钱！ \n　　当然，作为一个本份农民，起先这样做的时候，他心里总有点七上八下，很不踏实。后来他才知道，你不这样做也不行！有些公家人不仅不在乎这种请客送礼，而且还主动暗示或直截了当要你“出血”。这是一种“互惠”生意，既然公家人不怕，一个农民为什么有便宜不占呢？ \n　　一个可悲的事实是，许多土头土脑的农民。很大程度上是因为公职部门的不正之风和某些干部的枉法行为，才使他们成为“熟练的”生意人。他们提着黑人造革皮包，带着好烟名酒，从乡下来到城里，看起来动作迟笨，一脸忠厚，但精明地不会放过任何一个可以打开的“缺口”。 \n　　但和胡永合这样的生意人相比，孙少安在这方面仍然没有开什么大窍。他只会请人家在食堂里吃一顿饭——这是一个得了好处的乡下人通常感谢别人的方式。 \n　　说起来，孙少安的身上也还有一些明显的变化。比如说他现在身上的衣着装束，就今非昔比了。如今他只要外出办事，就会换上那套“礼服”；贴身一套红线衣，外面是一身廉价混纺毛料制服；足登“力士”牌球鞋；头上戴一顶深蓝的卡单帽，手里象其他生意人一样提着黑人造革皮包（也可斜着大背在身上）。当然，这身打扮在城里\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
