�有人动起手来。但总统这时却从那乱糟糟的一群中钻了出来，大步向迎接他的中国孩子走来。\n　　华华对这群吵吵闹闹的美国孩子似乎没有多大兴趣，只是兴奋地打量着面前的“空军一号”。他从其他中国孩子中后退了好几步，以便把飞机看得更全些。\n　　弗雷德曼大使走到总统身边，要向他介绍华华，但没等大使开口，总统就穿过人群，径直走到后面的华华那儿，同他拥抱起来。其它的美国孩子停止了争吵，大吃一惊。要知道，来访的美国孩子谁也没见过这个国家的小首脑，连照片都没有见过，要是弄错了怎么办？但戴维这方面的眼力是有百分之百把握的，大家很快看到他没有弄错，都松了一口气。\n　　“中国小朋友欢迎你们！”华华对戴维说。\n　　“Very glad to see you when humanbeing history start again！”戴维说。\n　　“总统说，非常高兴在人类历史重新开始之际见到您。”小翻译向华华解释说。\n　　“谢谢，您的大飞机真漂亮！”华华指着戴维身后的“空军一号”说。\n　　“Where is great wall？（长城在哪儿？）”不等小眼镜翻译华华的话，戴维就问，同时向远处张望着。\n　　“Where are the pandas？（大熊猫在哪儿？）”贝纳也在旁边问，她以为一踏上中国的土地，就能像在美国到处看到小狗那样看到大熊猫。\n　　“You……your ，嗯，plane is very……very good。”华华用可笑的英语把自己刚才的意思又说了一遍，令自己惊奇的是，小学高年级的那点儿单词居然能把意思说明。\n　　“Oh，yes，yes，great wall and pandas are good too！”戴维连连点头，同时仍在看着远方寻找长城。\n　　“总统说长城和大熊猫也很好。”\n　　“我们用大熊猫换你的大飞机好吗？”华华问。\n　　“OK！”贝纳听完翻译后，没等总统回答就兴奋地大叫起来，\"One male and one female！（一只公的一只母的！）\"\n　　“闭嘴！小白痴，那我们怎么回去？”戴维瞪了贝纳一眼说，接着他又对华华说了一句意味深长的话：\n　　“用长城换好吗？啊，我们明天再谈吧，我们就是来换东西的，我们要换的东西你根本想像不到。”\n　　华华不太明白这话的意思。\n　　戴维向华华一一介绍随行的其他美国孩子，最后介绍的是三位驾驶“空军一号”的机组人员，他们是一名机长，一名导航员和一名随机工程师。美国孩子没有想到，华华给予了这三个孩子最热烈的欢迎，他握住那个穿空军上尉服装的小飞行员的手说：\n　　“我早想当飞行员了，如果你们是中国孩子，咱们换换算了。开着这样的飞机飞越大洋，这该有多棒！”\n　　“可是，阁下，您的工作比我们伟大得多。”上尉恭恭敬敬地说。\n　　“别提这三个笨蛋了，他们\n######################\nOutput:",
