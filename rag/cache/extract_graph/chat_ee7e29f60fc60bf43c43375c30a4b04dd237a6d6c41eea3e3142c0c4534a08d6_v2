The troubadour was expected to provide some entertainment for the courtiers of the Great Hall; it was the payment he’d make in lieu of the money he no longer possessed.\nFrom the report of the Priest-Advocate who now pled the troubadour’s case, the Kadeshian had retained only the clothing on his back and the baliset slung over one shoulder on a leather cord.\n“He says he was fed a dark drink,” the Advocate said, barely hiding the smile which sought to twist his lips. “If it please your Holiness, the drink left him helpless but awake while his purse was cut.”\nJessica studied the troubadour while the Advocate droned on and on with a false subservience, his voice full of mucky morals. The Kadeshian was tall, easily two meters. He had a roving eye which showed intelligent alertness and humor. His golden hair was worn to the shoulders in the style of his planet, and there was a sense of virile strength in the broad chest and neatly tapering body which a grey Hajj robe could not conceal. His name was given as Tagir Mohandis and he was descended from merchant engineers, proud of his ancestry and himself.\nAlia finally cut off the pleading with a hand wave, spoke without turning: “The Lady Jessica will render first judgment in honor of her return to us.”\n“Thank you, daughter,” Jessica said, stating the order of ascendancy to all who heard. Daughter! So this Tagir Mohandis was part of their plan. Or was he an innocent dupe? This judgment was designed to open attack on herself, Jessica realized. It was obvious in Alia’s attitude.\n“Do you play that instrument well?” Jessica asked, indicating the nine-string baliset on the troubadour’s shoulder.\n“As well as the Great Gurney Halleck himself!” Tagir Mohandis spoke loudly for all in the hall to hear, and his words evoked an interested stir among the courtiers.\n“You seek the gift of transport money,” Jessica said. “Where would that money take you?”\n“To Salusa Secundus and Farad’n’s court,” Mohandis said. “I’ve heard he seeks troubadours and minstrels, that he Supports the arts and builds a great renaissance of cultivated life around him.”\nJessica refrained from glancing at Alia. They’d known, of course, what Mohandis would ask. She found herself enjoying this byplay. Did they think her unable to meet this thrust?\n“Will you play for your passage?” Jessica asked. “My terms are Fremen terms. If | enjoy your music, | may keep\nyou here to smooth away my cares; if your music offends me, | may send you to toil in the desert for your passage money. If | deem your playing just right for Farad’n, who is said to be an enemy of the Atreides, then | will send you to him with my blessing. Will you play on these terms, Tagir Mohandis?”\nHe threw his head back in a great roaring laugh. His blond hair danced as he unslung the baliset and tuned it deftly to indicate acceptance of her challenge.\nThe crowd in the chamber started to press closer, but were held back by courtiers and guards.\nPresently Mohandis strummed a note, holding the bass hum of the side strings with a fine attention to their compelling vibration. Then, lifting his voice in a mellow tenor, he sang, obviously improvising, but his touch so deft that Jessica was enthralled before she focused on his lyrics:\nYou say you long for Caladan seas, Where once you ruled, Atreides, Without surcease—\nBut exiles dwell in stranger-lands!\nYou say ‘twere bitter, men so rude, To sell your dreams of Shai-Hulud, For tasteless food—\nAnd exiles, dwell in stranger-lands.\nYou make Arrakis grow infirm, Silence the passage of the worm And end your term—\nAs exiles, dwell in stranger-lands.\nAlia! They name you Coan-Teen, That spirit who is never seen Until—\n“Enough!” Alia screamed. She pushed herself half out of her throne. “lIl have you—”\n“Alia!” Jessica spoke just loud enough, voice pitched just right to avoid confrontation while gaining full attention. It was a masterful use of Voice and all who heard it recognized the trained powers in this demonstration. Alia sank back into her seat and Jessica noted that she showed not the slightest discomfiture.\nThis, too, was anticipated, Jessica thought. How very interesting.\n“The judgment on this first one is mine,” Jessica reminded her.\n“Very well.” Alia’s words were barely audible.\n“I find this one a fitting gift for Farad’n,” Jessica said. “He has a tongue which cuts like a crysknife. Such bloodletting as that tongue can administer would be healthy for our own court, but I’d rather he ministered to House Corrino.”\nA light rippling of laughter spread through the hall.\nAlia permitted herself a snorting exhalation. “Do you know what he called me?”\n“He didn’t call you anything, daughter. He but reported that which he or anyone else could hear in the streets. There they call you Coan-Teen. .. .”\n“The female death-spirit who walks without feet,” Alia Snarled.\n“If you put away those who report accurately, you'll keep only those who know what you want to hear,” Jessica said, her voice sweet. “I can think of nothing more poisonous than to rot in the stink of your own reflections.”\nAudible gasps came from those immediately below the thrones.\nJessica focused on Mohandis, who remained silent, standing completely uncowed. He awaited whatever judgment was passed upon him as though it did not matter. Mohandis was exactly the kind of man her Duke would have chosen to have by his side in troubled times: one who acted with confidence of his own judgment, but accepted\nwhatever befell, even death, without berating his fate. Then why had he chosen this course?\n“Why did you sing those particular words?” Jessica asked him.\nHe lifted his head to speak clearly: “I’d heard that the Atreides were honorable and open-minded. I’d a thought to test it and perhaps to stay here in your service, thereby having the time to seek out those who robbed me and deal with them in my own fashion.”\n“He dares test us!” Alia muttered.\n“Why not?” Jessica asked.\nShe smiled down at the troubadour to signal goodwill. He had come into this hall only because it offered him opportunity for another adventure, another passage through his universe. Jessica found herself tempted to bind him to her own entourage, but Alia’s reaction boded evil for brave Mohandis. There were also those signs which said this was the course expected of the Lady Jessica—take a brave and handsome troubadour into her service as she’d taken brave Gurney Halleck. Best Mohandis were sent on his way, though it rankled to lose such a fine specimen to Farad’n.\n“He shall go to Farad’n,” Jessica said. “See that he gets his passage money. Let his tongue draw the blood of House Corrino and see how he survives it.”\nAlia glowered at the floor, then produced a belated smile. “The wisdom of the Lady Jessica prevails,” she said, waving Mohandis away.\nThat did not go the way she wanted, Jessica thought, but there were indicators in Alia’s manner that a more potent test remained.\nAnother supplicant was being brought forward.\nJessica, noting her daughter’s reaction, felt the gnawing of doubts. The lesson learned from the twins was needed here. Let Alia be Abomination, still she was one of the pre- born. She could know her mother as she knew herself. It did not compute that Alia would misjudge her mother’s\nreactions in the matter of the troubadour. Why did Alia stage that confrontation? To distract me?\nThere was no more time to reflect. The second supplicant had taken his place below the twin thrones, his Advocate at his side.\nThe supplicant was a Fremen this time, an old man with the sand marks of the desert-born on his face. He was not tall, but had a wiry body and the long dishdasha usually worn over a stillsuit gave him a stately appearance. The robe was in keeping with his narrow face and beaked nose, the glaring eyes of blue-on-blue. He wore no stillsuit and seemed uncomfortable without it. The gigantic space of the Audience Hall must seem to him like the dangerous open air which robbed his flesh of its priceless moisture. Under the hood, which had been thrown partly back, he wore the knotted keffiya headdress of a Naib.\n“lam Ghadhean al-Fali,” he said, placing one foot on the steps to the thrones to signify his status above that of the mob. “I was one of Muad’Dib’s death commandos and | am here concerning a matter of the desert.”\nAlia stiffened only slightly, a small betrayal. Al-Fali’s name had been on that demand to place Jessica on the Council.\nA matter of the desert! Jessica thought.\nGhadhean al-Fali had spoken before his Advocate could open the pleading. With that formal Fremen phrase he had placed them on notice that he brought them something of concern to all of Dune—and that he spoke with the authority of a Fedaykin who had offered his life beside that of Paul Muad’Dib. Jessica doubted that this was what Ghadhean al- Fali had told Javid or the Advocate General in seeking audience here. Her guess was confirmed as an official of the Priesthood rushed forward from the rear of the chamber waving the black cloth of intercession.\n“My Ladies!” the official called out. “Do not listen to this man! He comes under false—”\nJessica, watching the Priest run toward them, caught a movement out of the corners of her eyes, saw Alia’s hand Signaling in the old Atreides battle language: “Now!” Jessica could not determine where the signal was directed, but acted instinctively with a lurch to the left, taking throne and all. She rolled away from the crashing throne as she fell, came to her feet as she heard the sharp spat of a maula pistol... and again. But she was moving with the first sound, felt something tug at her right sleeve. She dove into the throng of supplicants and courtiers gathered below the dais. Alia, she noted, had not moved.\nSurrounded by people, Jessica stopped.\nGhadhean al-Fali, she saw, had dodged to the other side of the dais, but the Advocate remained in his original position.\nIt had all happened with the rapidity of an ambush, but everyone in the Hall knew where trained reflexes should have taken anyone caught by surprise. Alia and the Advocate stood frozen in their exposure.\nA disturbance toward the middle of the room caught Jessica’s attention and she forced a way through the throng, saw four supplicants holding the Priest official. His black cloth of intercession lay near his feet, a maula pistol exposed in its folds.\nAl-Fali thrust his way past Jessica, looked from the pistol to the Priest. The Fremen let out a cry of rage, came up from his belt with an achag blow, the fingers of his left hand rigid. They caught the Priest in the throat and he collapsed, strangling. Without a backward glance at the man he had killed, the old Naib turned an angry face toward the dais.\n“Dalal-il ’an-nubuwwa!” al-Fali called, placing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ee7e29f60fc60bf43c43375c30a4b04dd237a6d6c41eea3e3142c0c4534a08d6_v2"}
