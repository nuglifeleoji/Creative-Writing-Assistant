�：“军土苦水，乞太尉移营高处。”懿大怒曰：“吾军令已发，汝何敢故违！”即命推出斩之，悬首于辕门外。于是军心震慑。\n\n    懿令南寨人马暂退二十里，纵城内军民出城樵采柴薪，牧放牛马。司马陈群问曰：“前太尉攻上庸之时，兵分八路，八日赶至城下，遂生擒孟达而成大功；今带甲四万，数千里而来，不令攻打城池，却使久居泥泞之中，又纵贼众樵牧。某实不知太尉是何主意？”懿笑曰：“公不知兵法耶？昔孟达粮多兵少，我粮少兵多，故不可不速战；出其不意，突然攻之，方可取胜。今辽兵多，我兵少，贼饥我饱，何必力攻？正当任彼自走，然后乘机击之。我今放开一条路，不绝彼之樵牧，是容彼自走也。”陈群拜服。\n\n    于是司马懿遣人赴洛阳催粮。魏主曹睿设朝，群臣皆奏曰：“近日秋雨连绵，一月不止，人马疲劳，可召回司马懿，权且罢兵。”睿曰：“司马太尉善能用兵，临危制变，多有良谋，捉公孙渊计日而待。卿等何必忧也？”遂不听群臣之谏，使人运粮解至司马懿军前。\n\n    懿在寨中，又过数日，雨止天晴。是夜，懿出帐外，仰观天文，忽见一星，其大如斗，流光数丈，自首山东北，坠于襄平东南。各营将士，无不惊骇。懿见之大喜，乃谓众将曰：“五日之后，星落处必斩公孙渊矣。来日可并力攻城。”众将得令，次日侵晨，引兵四面围合，筑土山，掘地道，立炮架，装云梯，日夜攻打不息，箭如急雨，射入城去。\n\n    公孙渊在城中粮尽，皆宰牛马为食。人人怨恨，各无守心，欲斩渊首，献城归降。渊闻之，甚是惊忧，慌令相国王建、御史大夫柳甫，往魏寨请降。二人自城上系下，来告司马懿曰：“请太尉退二十里，我君臣自来投降。”懿大怒曰：“公孙渊何不自来？殊为无理！”叱武士推出斩之，将首级付与从人。从人回报，公孙渊大惊，又遣侍中卫演来到魏营。司马懿升帐，聚众将立于两边。演膝行而进，跪于帐下，告曰：“愿太尉息雷霆之怒。克日先送世子公孙修为质当，然后君臣自缚来降。”懿曰：“军事大要有五：能战当战，不能战当守，不能守当走，不能走当降，不能降当死耳！何必送子为质当？”叱卫演回报公孙渊，演抱头鼠窜而去。\n\n
