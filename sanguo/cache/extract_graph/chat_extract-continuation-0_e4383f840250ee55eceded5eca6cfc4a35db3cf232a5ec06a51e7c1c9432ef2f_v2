诞大怒曰：“汝教我尽去北军，欲谋我耶？”叱左右推出斩之。文鸯、文虎见父被杀，各拔短刀，立杀数十人，飞身上城，一跃而下，越壕赴魏寨投降。司马昭恨文鸯昔日单骑退兵之仇，欲斩之。钟会谏曰：“罪在文钦，今文钦已亡，二子势穷来归，若杀降将，是坚城内人之心也。”昭从之，遂召文鸯、文虎入帐，用好言抚慰，赐骏马锦衣，加为偏将军，封关内侯。二子拜谢，上马绕城大叫曰：“我二人蒙大将军赦罪赐爵，汝等何不早降！”城内人闻言，皆计议曰：“文鸯乃司马氏仇人，尚且重用，何况我等乎？”于是皆欲投降。诸葛诞闻之大怒，日夜自来巡城。以杀为威。\n\n    钟会知城中人心已变，乃入帐告昭曰：“可乘此时攻城矣。”昭大喜，遂激三军，四面云集，一齐攻打。守将曾宣献了北门，放魏兵入城。诞知魏兵已入；慌引麾下数百人，自城中小路突出；至吊桥边，正撞着胡奋，手起刀落，斩诞于马下，数百人皆被缚。王基引兵杀到西门，正遇吴将于诠。基大喝曰：“何不早降！”诠大怒曰：“受命而出，为人救难，既不能救，又降他人，义所不为也！”乃掷盔于地，大呼曰：“人生在世，得死于战场者，幸耳！”急挥刀死战三十余合，人困马乏，为乱军所杀。后人有诗赞曰：“司马当年围寿春，降兵无数拜车尘。东吴虽有英雄士，谁及于诠肯杀身！”\n\n    司马昭入寿春，将诸葛诞老小尽皆枭首，灭其三族。武士将所擒诸葛诞部卒数百人缚至。昭曰：“汝等降否？”众皆大叫曰：“愿与诸葛公同死，决不降汝！”昭大怒，叱武士尽缚于城外，逐一问曰：“降者免死。”并无一人言降。直杀至尽，终无一人降者。昭深加叹息不已，令皆埋之。后人有诗赞曰：“忠臣矢志不偷生，诸葛公休帐下兵，《薤露》歌声应未断，遗踪直欲继田横！”\n\n    却说吴兵大半降魏，裴秀告司马昭曰：“吴兵老小，尽在东南江、淮之地，今若留之，久必为变；不如坑之。”钟会曰：“不然。古之用兵者，全国为上，戮其元恶而已。若尽坑之，是不仁也。不如放归江南，以显中国之宽大。”昭曰：“此妙论也。”遂将吴兵尽皆放归本国。唐咨因惧孙綝，不敢回国，亦来降魏。昭皆重用，令分布三河之地。淮南已平。正�\n######################\nOutput:",
