It houses the **Alhamia Prison**, a key site where hostages—including notable figures like **Samuel Namara** and members of the **Aurelian** and **Atreides** factions—were held during conflicts. The city is frequently referenced in the context of **hostage exchanges**, **political maneuvers**, and **geopolitical strife**, underscoring its role as a strategic stronghold.  \n\nTiruzia is mentioned in **Fremen curses**, suggesting it holds symbolic or cultural weight beyond its political function. While some descriptions ambiguously link it to events involving the **Bene Gesserit** and **Honored Matres**, the most consistent narrative places it as the capital of Firuzabad, where imprisonment and hostage situations—such as **Duke Leto’s captivity**—unfolded.  \n\nThough not always directly referenced in every passage, Tiruzia remains a recurring setting in the *Dune* saga, tied to **Alhamia Prison** and pivotal moments in the broader conflict.
