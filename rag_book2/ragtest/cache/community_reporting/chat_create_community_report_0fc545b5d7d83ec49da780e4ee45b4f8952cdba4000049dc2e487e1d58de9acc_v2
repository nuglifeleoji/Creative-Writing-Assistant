Held weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays at Yongming University, the event serves as a platform for members of both clubs to practice and interact. Notably, it was during one of these sessions that the characters Cheng (诚) and Xue Sui (雪穗) first met. The joint practice fosters camaraderie and skill-sharing between the two universities' dance communities, blending structured training with social engagement.\",4\n433,婚礼,\"The wedding involves multiple relationships centered around the character 唐泽雪穗 (Yukiho Karasawa). Initially, it was described as the remarriage of 筱冢康晴 (Yasuharu Shinozuka) and 雪穗, which was kept low-key due to both having been previously married. The ceremony was noted for its subdued nature, with the bride and groom appearing deeply happy.  \n\nHowever, conflicting details emerge regarding another wedding involving 高宫诚 (Makoto Takamiya) and 雪穗, scheduled to take place in two weeks at a hotel in Tokyo. This event is causing 诚 significant internal conflict, suggesting emotional turmoil ahead of the ceremony.  \n\nTo reconcile these contradictions, it appears there may be a timeline discrepancy or overlapping narratives involving 雪穗's marriages. The most coherent interpretation is that 雪穗 was first engaged to 高宫诚, with their wedding impending but marked by his unease, while her later remarriage to 筱冢康晴 was a quieter, more contented affair. Alternatively, the descriptions could refer to the same event with inconsistent naming (possibly due to translation or contextual errors).  \n\nIn summary, the weddings associated with 雪穗 include:  \n1. An upcoming ceremony with 高宫诚, fraught with tension, set in a Tokyo hotel.  \n2. A subdued remarriage to 筱冢康晴, where both appeared joyous.  \nThe exact sequence or accuracy of names may require clarification, but the accounts collectively depict 雪穗's marital transitions as emotionally complex, ranging from conflict to quiet happiness.  \n\n(Word count: 199)\",3\n431,赖子,\"赖子是诚的母亲，与诚的外公外婆一起住在家里。她即将成为雪穗的婆婆，并对这段婚姻持支持态度。赖子性格开朗健谈，这一点在高宫和唐泽两家的聚餐中表现得尤为明显。她对雪穗颇为喜爱，甚至在婚前主动帮忙打扫新房，展现出对儿子和儿媳的关心。  \n\n然而，赖子对诚和雪穗婚后没有孩子一事感到不满，曾建议他们去医院检查，流露出传统家庭观念中对子嗣的期待。此外，当诚因会见朋友而离开家庭聚餐时，赖子表现出明显的不悦，反映出她对家庭团聚的重视以及对儿子行为的关切。  \n\n综合来看，赖子是一位关爱家庭、重视传统的母亲，既支持儿子的婚姻，又对家庭生活的某些方面抱有明确期望，偶尔会因事与愿违而流露出情绪。\",2\n430,诚,\"**Summary of 诚 (Makoto):**  \n\n诚 (Makoto) is a central male character in the story, primarily known as the husband of 雪穗 (Yukiho), though their relationship is complex and strained. He is a graduate of 永明大学 (Eimei University), where he served as the vice president of the social dance club, and he initially fell in love with Yukiho at first sight, leading to a four-year courtship before their marriage. At the time of their engagement, Makoto was preparing for their wedding while secretly harboring feelings for another woman, 三泽千都留 (Misawa Chizuru), with whom he later develops an ambiguous relationship, even taking her to the 公园美景酒店 (Park View Hotel).  \n\nProfessionally, Makoto works at 东西电装 (Tōzai Densō) and is involved in investigating potential plagiarism related to a metal processing expert system. He comes from the affluent 高宫 (Takamiya) family, inheriting multiple properties, yet he feels insecure about Yukiho’s professional success and domestic competence. Their marriage is marked by tension, as Makoto resents Yukiho’s work commitments, neglect of household duties, and stock investments, though he occasionally relents out of guilt or sympathy. He also struggles with alcohol, and there are implications of drunken violence toward Yukiho, though he has no memory of such incidents.  \n\nPersonality-wise, Makoto is passive, prone to dissatisfaction, and often feels he has overlooked critical aspects of his life, particularly in his relationship with Yukiho. He takes golf lessons with Chizuru, despite having little interest or skill in the sport, reflecting his internal conflict between duty and desire. His sense of responsibility initially drives him to marry Yukiho, but he later grapples with regret and unresolved emotions, particularly regarding Chizuru, whom he struggles to reconnect with.  \n\nIn summary, Makoto is a conflicted figure—torn between societal expectations, familial pressures, and personal longing—whose marriage to Yukiho deteriorates amid resentment, insecurity, and external temptations.\",35\n457,银座,\"银座是东京著名的繁华商业区，以其高级精品店和高端购物体验而闻名。与大阪的心斋桥不同，银座以其更为奢华和精致的商业氛围著称，吸引了众多追求高品质消费的游客和本地居民。  \n\n在文学或叙事作品中，银座被描绘为一个重要的社交与商业活动场所。例如，典子曾将银座与心斋桥进行比较，突显两者在风格与定位上的差异。此外，银座也是今枝与筱冢会面的地点，强调了该区域作为商务会谈和人际交往的枢纽地位。  \n\n银座还出现在诚和雪穗的购物场景中，进一步印证了其作为东京高端消费中心的角色。无论是商业会面、休闲购物，还是城市文化象征，银座都以其独特的魅力成为东京不可或缺的地标之一。\",4\n435,新宿车站,\"新宿车站是东京的重要交通枢纽，位于东京都新宿区，是日本乃至全球最繁忙的车站之一。它不仅连接了多条JR线路、私营铁路和地铁线路，还因其便利的交通条件成为许多商业活动和日常出行的核心节点。  \n\n在文学作品中，新宿车站也被描绘为人物会面的重要场所，例如小说中诚与筱冢一成的相遇便发生于此。此外，该车站地理位置优越，靠近今枝直巳事务所等商业设施，进一步凸显了其作为城市交通与商业活动中心的重要性。  \n\n综合来看，新宿车站不仅是东京交通网络的关键节点，也是社会互动和商业往来的重要场所，兼具功能性与文化意义。\",2\n458,三越,三越是日本著名的百货公司,2\n459,松屋,松屋是日本著名的百货公司,2\n571,黑客,Term used to describe people who intrude into computer systems for mischief,2\n436,千里,\"千里是大阪的一个地区，诚大学期间曾独自居住在此。\"\"\",1\n468,三泽小姐,,1\n536,NTT股票上市,\"NTT股票上市后掀起狂飙，引发全民炒股的热潮\"\"\",1\n572,公园美景,三年前诚与千都留计划见面的酒店，象征两人未果的过去>,1\n573,芝华士,威士忌品牌，诚在约会时饮用的酒类>,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n501,唐泽雪穗,联合练习,唐泽雪穗最初与川岛江利子一起参加联合练习，后偶尔单独行动。,99\n665,雪穗,婚礼,雪穗即将在两周后与诚举行婚礼。,92\n664,雪穗,赖子,雪穗与赖子是家人关系，其中赖子是诚的家人。雪穗是赖子的儿媳，两人之间既有亲密互动也存在矛盾。赖子对雪穗表现出关爱，例如喜欢她并主动帮助她打扫新房。然而，赖子也对雪穗无法怀孕一事感到不满，这成为两人关系中的紧张点。整体而言，她们的互动体现了家庭关系的复杂性，既有相互支持的一面，也有因现实问题而产生的分歧。,91\n719,诚,银座,诚和雪穗在银座购物,39\n667,诚,赖子,\"诚是赖子的儿子，赖子作为诚的母亲，与诚一起生活。赖子支持诚和雪穗的婚姻，但对两人没有孩子感到不满。  \n\nIn this summary:  \n- **诚** is identified as **赖子**'s son, and they live together as family.  \n- **赖子** is explicitly noted as **诚**'s mother, clarifying the familial relationship.  \n- While **赖子** supports **诚** and **雪穗**'s marriage, she expresses dissatisfaction over their lack of children, resolving the apparent contradiction in the descriptions by distinguishing between her general support for the marriage and her specific disappointment regarding parenthood.  \n\nThe summary maintains coherence by prioritizing the clearest relationships (mother-son) and addressing the nuanced stance on the marriage and childlessness.
