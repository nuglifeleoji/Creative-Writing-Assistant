There’s no need for a hasty decision.”\n“There’s always the possibility that you’ve already played into my daughter’s hands.” Jessica said.\nFarad’n stiffened. “Explain!”\n“Matters on Arrakis are not as they may seem to you,” Jessica said. “Alia plays her own game, Abomination’s game. My granddaughter is in danger unless Alia can contrive a way to use her.”\n“You expect me to believe that you and your daughter oppose each other, that Atreides fights Atreides?”\nJessica looked at Wensicia, back to Farad’n. “Corrino fights Corrino.”\nA wry smile moved Farad’n’s lips. “Well taken. How would | have played into your daughter’s hands?”\n“By becoming implicated in my grandson’s death, by abducting me.”\n“Abduct.. .”\n“Don’t trust this witch,” Wensicia cautioned.\n“I’ll choose whom to trust, mother,” Farad’n said. “Forgive me, Lady Jessica, but | don’t understand this matter of abduction. I’d understood that you and your faithful retainer\n“Who is Alia’s husband,” Jessica said.\nFarad’n turned a measuring stare on Idaho, looked to the Bashar. “What think you, Tyek?”\nThe Bashar apparently was having thoughts similar to those Jessica professed. He said: “I like her reasoning. Caution!”\n“He’s a ghola-mentat,” Farad’n said. “We could test him to the death and not find a certain answer.”\n“But it’s a safe working assumption that we may’ve been tricked,” Tyekanik said.\nJessica knew the moment had come to make her move. Now if Idaho’s grief only kept him locked in the part he’d chosen. She disliked using him this way, but there were larger considerations.\n“To begin with,” Jessica said, “I might announce publicly that | came here of my own free choice.”\n“Interesting,” Farad’n said.\n“You'd have to trust me and grant me the complete freedom of Salusa Secundus,” Jessica said. “There could be no appearance that | spoke out of compulsion.”\n“No!” Wensicia protested.\nFarad’n ignored her. “What reason would you give?”\n“That I’m the Sisterhood’s plenipotentiary sent here to take over your education.”\n“But the Sisterhood accuses—”\n“That'd require a decisive action from you,” Jessica said.\n“Don’t trust her!” Wensicia said.\nWith extreme politeness, Farad’n glanced at her, said: “If you interrupt me once more, l'Il have Tyek remove you. He heard you consent to the formal investiture. That binds him to me now.”\n“She’s a witch, | tell you!” Wensicia looked to the mute against the side wall.\nFarad’n hesitated. Then: “Tyek, what think you? Have | been witched?”\n“Not in my judgment. She—”\n“You’ve both been witched!”\n“Mother.” His tone was flat and final.\nWensicia clenched her fists, tried to speak, whirled, and fled the room.\nAddressing himself once more to Jessica, Farad’n asked: “Would the Bene Gesserit consent to this?”\n“They would.”\nFarad’n absorbed the implications of this, smiled tightly. “What does the Sisterhood want in all of this?”\n“Your marriage to my granddaughter.”\nIdaho shot a questioning look at Jessica, made as though to speak, but remained silent.\nJessica said: “You were going to say something, Duncan?”\n“I was going to say that the Bene Gesserit want what they’ve always wanted: a universe which won’t interfere with them.”\n“An obvious assumption,” Farad’n said, “but | hardly see why you intrude with it.”\nIdaho’s eyebrows managed the shrug which the shigawire would not permit his body. Disconcertingly, he smiled.\nFarad’n saw the smile, whirled to confront Idaho. “I amuse you?”\n“This whole situation amuses me. Someone in your family has compromised the Spacing Guild by using them to carry instruments of assassination to Arrakis, instruments whose intent could not be concealed. You’ve offended the Bene Gesserit by killing a male they wanted for their breeding pro\n“You call me a liar, ghola?”\n“No. | believe you didn’t know about the plot. But | thought the situation needed bringing into focus.”\n“Don’t forget that he’s a mentat,” Jessica cautioned.\n“My very thought,” Farad’n said. Once more he faced Jessica. “Let us say that | free you and you make your announcement. That still leaves the matter of your grandson's death. The mentat is correct.”\n“Was it your mother?” Jessica asked.\n“My Lord!” Tyekanik warned.\n“It’s all right, Tyvek.” Farad’n waved a hand easily. “And if | say it was my mother?”\nRisking everything in the test of this internal break among the Corrino, Jessica said: “You must denounce her and banish her.”\n“My Lord,” Tyekanik said, “there could be trickery within trickery here.”\nIdaho said: “And the Lady Jessica and | are the ones who've been tricked.”\nFarad’n’s jaw hardened.\nAnd Jessica thought: Don’t interfere, Duncan! Not now! But Idaho’s words had sent her own Bene Gesserit abilities at logic into motion. He shocked her. She began to wonder if there were the possibility that she was being used in ways she didn’t understand. Ghanima and Leto... . The pre-born could draw upon countless inner experiences, a storehouse of advice far more extensive than the living Bene Gesserit depended upon. And there was that other question: Had her own Sisterhood been completely candid with her? They still\nmight not trust her. After all, she’d betrayed them once... to her Duke.\nFarad’n looked at Idaho with a puzzled frown. “Mentat, | need to know what this Preacher is to you.”\n“He arranged the passage here. |... . We did not exchange ten words. Others acted for him. He could be.... He could be Paul Atreides, but | don’t have enough data for certainty. All | know for certain is that it was time for me to leave and he had the means.”\n“You speak of being tricked,” Farad’n reminded him.\n“Alia expects you to kill us quietly and conceal the evidence of it,” Idaho said. “Having rid her of the Lady Jessica, I’m no longer useful. And the Lady Jessica, having served her Sisterhood’s purposes, is no longer useful to them. Alia will be calling the Bene Gesserit to account, but they will win.”\nJessica closed her eyes in concentration. He was right! She could hear the mentat firmness in his voice, that deep sincerity of pronouncement. The pattern fell into place without a chink. She took two deep breaths and triggered the mnemonic trance, rolled the data through her mind, came out of the trance and opened her eyes. It was done while Farad’n moved from in front of her to a position within half a step of Idaho—a space of no more than three steps.\n“Say no more, Duncan,” Jessica said, and she thought mournfully of how Leto had warned her against Bene Gesserit conditioning.\nIdaho, about to speak, closed his mouth.\n“I command here,” Farad’n said. “Continue, mentat.”\nIdaho remained silent.\nFarad’n half turned to study Jessica.\nShe stared at a point on the far wall, reviewing what Idaho and the trance had built. The Bene Gesserit hadn’t abandoned the Atreides line, of course. But they wanted control of a Kwisatz Haderach and they’d invested too much in the long breeding program. They wanted the open clash\nbetween Atreides and Corrino, a situation where they could step in as arbiters. And Duncan was right. They’d emerge with control of both Ghanima and Farad’n. It was the only compromise possible. The wonder was that Alia hadn’t seen it. Jessica swallowed past a tightness in her throat. Alia... . Abomination! Ghanima was right to pity her. But who was left to pity Ghanima?\n“The Sisterhood has promised to put you on the throne with Ghanima as your mate,” Jessica said.\nFarad’n took a backward step. Did the witch read minds?\n“They worked secretly and not through your mother,” Jessica said. “They told you | was not privy to their plan.”\nJessica read revelation in Farad’n’s face. How open he was. But it was true, the whole structure. Idaho had demonstrated masterful abilities as a mentat in seeing through to the fabric on the limited data available to him.\n“So they played a double game and told you,” Farad’n said.\n“They told me nothing of this,” Jessica said. “Duncan was correct: they tricked me.” She nodded to herself. It had been a Classic delaying action in the Sisterhood’s traditional pattern—a reasonable story, easily accepted because it squared with what one might believe of their motives. But they wanted Jessica out of the way—a flawed sister who’d failed them once.\nTyekanik moved to Farad’n’s side. “My Lord, these two are too dangerous to—”\n“Wait a bit, Tyek,” Farad’n said. “There are wheels within wheels here.” He faced Jessica. “We’ve had reasons to believe that Alia might offer herself as my bride.”\nIdaho gave an involuntary start, controlled himself. Blood began dripping from his left wrist where the shigawire had cut.\nJessica allowed herself a small, eye-widening response. She who'd known the original Leto as lover, father of her\nchildren, confidant and friend, saw his trait of cold reasoning filtered now through the twistings of an Abomination.\n“Will you accept?” Idaho asked.\n“It is being considered.”\n“Duncan, | told you to be silent,” Jessica said. She addressed Farad’n. “Her price was two inconsequential deaths—the two of us.”\n“We suspected treachery,” Farad’n said. “Wasn’t it your son who said ‘treachery breeds treachery?’”\n“The Sisterhood is out to control both Atreides and Corrino,” Jessica said. “Isn’t that obvious?”\n“We're toying now with the idea of accepting your offer, Lady Jessica, but Duncan Idaho should be sent back to his loving wife.”\nPain is a function of nerves, |daho reminded himself. Pain comes as light comes to the eyes. Effort comes from the muscles, not from nerves. It was an old mentat drill and he completed it in the space of one breath, flexed his right wrist and severed an artery against the shigawire.\nTyekanik leaped to the chair, hit its trip lock to release the bindings, shouted for medical aid. It was revealing that assistants came swarming at once through doors hidden in wall panels.\nThere was always a bit of foolishness in Duncan, Jessica thought.\nFarad’n studied Jessica a moment while the medics ministered to Idaho. “I didn’t say | was going to accept his Alia.”\n“That’s not why he cut his wrist,” Jessica said.\n“Oh? | thought he was simply removing himself.”\n“You're not that stupid,” Jessica said. “Stop pretending with me.”\nHe smiled. “I’m well aware that Alia would destroy me.
