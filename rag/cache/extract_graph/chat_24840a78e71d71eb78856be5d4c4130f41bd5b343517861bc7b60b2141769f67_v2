But | doubt he'll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis.”\n“You...took one?” Hawat asked.\n“It was a good fight,” the Fremen said. “We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.”\nThere were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!\n“We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. “Some of those are good fighters.”\nOne of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. “Are you talking about Sardaukar?”\n“He’s talking about Sardaukar,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar!” the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice. “Ah-h-h, so that’s what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?”\n“We...don’t know,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar,” the Fremen mused. “Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that not strange?”\n“The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,” Hawat said.\n“But you know they are Sardaukar.”\n“Who am I?” Hawat asked bitterly.\n“You are Thufir Hawat,” the man said matter-of- factly. “Well, we would have learned it in time. We’ve sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet’s men.”\nHawat’s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: “You...captured Sardaukar?”\n“Only three of them,” the Fremen said. “They fought well.”\nIf only we’d had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. /f only we could’ve trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we’d have had!\n“Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen said. “If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved.”\n“I serve the...Lisan al-Gaib,” Hawat said. “His welfare is my concern. I’ve pledged myself to this.”\n“You are pledged to his water?”\nHawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his attention to the squatting figure. “To his water, yes.”\n“You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?”\n“To...yes, to the place of his water.”\n“Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?” The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly.\nHawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among the men.\nThe Fremen said: “There is always a way to water.”\nBehind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat’s aide called: “Thufir! Arkie just died.”\nThe Fremen put a fist to his ear. “The bond of water! It’s a sign!” He stared at Hawat. “We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall | call my men?”\nThe aide returned to Hawat’s side, said: “Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen. They're... well, you know how it is at a time like this.”\nThe Fremen still held his fist to his ear. “Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?” he demanded.\nHawat’s mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen’s words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it.\n“The bond of water,” Hawat said.\n“Let our tribes be joined,” the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.\nAs though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with\nhim along the cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.\nIt was over before Hawat’s tired men could gather their wits. The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.\nOne of Hawat’s men shouted: “Where they going with Arkie? He was—”\n“They're taking him to...bury him,” Hawat said.\n“Fremen don’t bury their dead!” the man barked. “Don’t you try any tricks on us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of—”\n“Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen said. “If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures.”\nBut Hawat’s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a lasgun. He started to draw it.\n“Stop right where you are!” Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles. “These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but the meaning’s the same.”\n“They're going to render Arkie down for his water,” the man with the lasgun snarled.\n“Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?” the Fremen asked.\nHe doesn’t even see the problem, Hawat thought. The naïveté of the Fremen was frightening.\n“They’re concerned for a respected comrade,” Hawat said.\n“We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,” the Fremen said. “This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man’s flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.”\nHawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. “Will you now help our wounded?”\n“One does not question the bond,” the Fremen said. “We will do for you what a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and see to the necessities.”\nThe man with the lasgun hesitated.\nHawat’s aide said: “Are we buying help with Arkie’s...water?”\n“Not buying,” Hawat said. “We've joined these people.”\n“Customs differ,” one of his men muttered.\nHawat began to relax.\n“And they'll help us get to Arrakeen?”\n“We will kill Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. He grinned. “And Sardaukar.” He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: “An aircraft comes. Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless.”\nAt a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.\nThe Fremen took Hawat’s arm, pressed him back with the others. “We will fight in the time of fighting,” the man said. He reached beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.\nHawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.\nThe Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the animal’s head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bat’s upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen’s opened hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat’s head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.\nThe bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.\nThe Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his head, listening. “They quarter the high country,” he said. “One wonders who they seek up there.”\n“It’s known that we retreated in this direction,” Hawat said.\n“One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,” the Fremen said. “Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.”\nTime passed.\nSome of Hawat’s men stirred, whispering.\n“Remain silent as frightened animals,” the Fremen hissed.\nHawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff —flitting blurs of tan on tan.\n“My little friend carried his message,” the Fremen said. “He is a good messenger—day or night. I'll be unhappy to lose that one.”\nThe movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing\nremained but the growing pressure of the day’s heat —blurred columns of rising air.\n“Be most silent now,” the Fremen whispered.\nA file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.\nA “thwok-thwok” of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawat’s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them—an Atreides ‘thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The ’thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink.\nThe group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.\nThe ‘thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the ‘thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of Shields and, in their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.\n“Aiinh! They use their stupid shields,” the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.\n“They are Sardaukar,” Hawat whispered.\n“Good.”\nThe Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.\nAbruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the ornithopter, then\nin it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion.\nPresently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.\n“They left only three men in their ‘thopter,” the Fremen beside Hawat said. “That was fortunate. | don’t believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.”\nBehind Hawat, one of his men whispered: “Those were Sardaukar!”\n“Did you notice how well they fought?” the Fremen asked.\nHawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they fought well, indeed.”\nThe captured ‘thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\nSo these Fremen can handle ‘thopters, too, Hawat thought.\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once...twice.\n“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready.
