“第一次？”草S讶异地反问，“你们见了好几次吗？”\n    “只有两次。第二次，他说是受你委托才来的。”\n    “受我之托？”草S的目光游移，“他是怎么跟您说的？”\n    “他说什么你叫他先来问问我愿不愿意协助警方调查……”\n    “喔，协助调查啊。”草S边走边抓着额头。\n    石神直觉，事情有点不对劲。这个刑警看起来一脸困惑，也许他根本不知道汤川说的这回事。\n    草S露出苦笑。\n    “我跟他谈了很多，所以到底是哪件事，我已经有点记不清楚了。他说请您怎么协助调查？”\n    石神思索着刑警的问题，他不知是否该说出花冈靖子的名字。不过现在装傻也没用，草S想必还会去找汤川确认。\n    “叫我监视花冈靖子。”石神说。草S闻言，瞪大了眼。\n    “这样啊，我懂了，原来如此。对，我的确跟他说过这样的话。大意是如果能得到石神先生协助就好了，所以他才贴心地立刻帮我转告您吧。原来如此，我明白了。”\n    在石神听来，刑警的这番话分明就是临时掰来圆谎的。如此说来，是汤川自作主张地来说那种话，他究竟有何目的呢？\n    石神停下脚，转身面对草S。\n    “你今天特地来找我，就是为了问这个？”\n    “不，对不起。刚才那只是开场白，其实我另有要事。”草S从外套口袋取出一张照片，“您看过这个人吗？是我偷拍的，拍得不是很清楚。”\n    石神一看照片，霎时屏息。\n    上面拍的是他现在最在意的人，他不知道对方的名字，也不清楚对方的身份。唯一知道的，就是此人和靖子很熟，如此而已。\n    “怎么样？”草S又问了 一次。\n    该怎么回答？石神想。说句不知道就没事了，可是这样的话，也就无法套出关于此人的情报。\n    “我好像看过。”石神慎重回答，“这是什么人？”\n    “您是在哪看到的，能不能再仔细想想？”\n    “你这么说可难倒我了，因为我每天看过太多人了。如果能告诉我名字或职业，或许比较容易回想。”\n    “这个人姓工藤，经营印刷公司。”\n    “工藤先生？”\n    “对。”\n    他姓工藤啊――石神凝视着照片。不过话说回来，刑警为何要调查此人？想当然耳，一定和花冈靖子有关。换句话说，这个刑警认为花冈靖子和工藤之间有特殊关系吗？\n    “怎么样？想起什么了吗？”\n    “嗯……好像是在哪看过。”石神歪着头，“对不起，就是想不起来，我说不定把他当成别人了。”\n
