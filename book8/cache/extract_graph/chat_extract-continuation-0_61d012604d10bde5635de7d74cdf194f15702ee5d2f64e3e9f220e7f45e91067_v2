本身开始放大，绿色光芒从两侧向下流淌，一直到地面，化为一扇门户的样子。整个召唤金钱都是绿光大放，诡异的能量波动令门内顿时变得一片幽深。\n\n    蓝轩宇扭头看了他一眼，左手银纹蓝银草已经释放出来，草叶反卷，包覆住了自己的手掌。\n\n    似乎是受到了召唤之门的威吓，正从四个方向冲过来的熔岩犬速度都降低了下来，但还是迅速形成了包围圈，向三人围了上来。\n\n    “我们先冲到一边去，以免腹背受敌。”比较有战斗经验的刘锋叫了一声，然后就率先朝着一个方向冲了出去。\n\n    十年的熔岩犬单独一只显然是不强的，但此时数量太多。\n\n    这时候蓝轩宇就看到刘锋的速度了。\n\n    只见他身上白光一闪，整个人就已经冲了出去，那真是奇快无比，只是一闪身，就已经在七、八米开外。手中白龙枪顺势上挑，一头刚刚冲上来的熔岩犬顿时被他枪尖挑中，直接送上了天空。\n\n    刘锋神随枪走，竟是在半空中追上了那只熔岩犬，枪身下抽，劈在其上，将它狠狠的砸在地面上。身体同时借力，继续向前冲去。\n\n    这斗兽场的直径也不过就是五十米左右，他这连续两冲顿时距离墙边就近了。\n\n    但是……\n\n    他的速度实在是有些太快了，以至于，他这么一冲，立刻就拉开了和蓝轩宇以及钱磊之间的距离。\n\n    钱磊的召唤之门这时候也已经完成了，蓝轩宇只听一声“喵喵”叫声，一只身长不过半尺的白色小猫从门里钻了出来。\n\n    白色小猫才从召唤之门中一探头，就看到了正冲上来的那一只只熔岩犬，吓得发出一声怪叫，“嗖”的一下就缩回了召唤之门。然后，那召唤之门就消失了，召唤金钱落回到了一脸尴尬的钱磊手中。\n\n    “这个……，我也不想的……”钱磊一脸的无辜。\n\n    蓝轩宇的表情着实是不太好，也好不了。这俩室友也是队友，着实是有些不靠谱啊！而且还不是一般的不靠谱……\n\n    一个精神大条，发动起来不管不顾。另一个就别提了，召唤个小猫，还扭头就跑，这都什么鬼啊什么鬼……\n\n    但这会儿也没有让他更多思考的时间，因为周围的熔岩犬都已经冲上来了，除了一部分去追刘锋之外，大多数都朝着他们俩的方向扑来。\n\n    蚁多还咬死象呢，更何况是一群狗。\n------------\n\n第八十八章 不靠谱的队友\n\n
