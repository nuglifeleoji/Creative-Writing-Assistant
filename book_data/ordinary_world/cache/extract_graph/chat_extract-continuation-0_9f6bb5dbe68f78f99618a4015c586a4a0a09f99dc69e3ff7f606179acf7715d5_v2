\n　　唉，唯一使他晚上熬煎得睡不着觉的仍然是大女儿兰花。该死的女婿一年逛得不归家门，丢下那母子三人受了多少牺惶！可怜两个小外孙，从小到大等于没有父亲。眼下两个娃娃总算被不幸的女儿拉扯大了。娃娃也都是些好娃娃。外孙女猫蛋十三岁，在石圪节上了初中，听说象她姨兰香一样，回回考试都是头名。外孙子狗蛋再有一年也要上初中了。可是，那个挨刀子的王满银却还在门外当逛鬼！少安曾建议让他姐离婚。兰花不同意，他也不同意。 \n　　人常说好女不嫁二男嘛！女婿再不是个东西，也不能走离婚这条路；离婚女人名声不好听啊！再说，两个娃娃都大了，怎能离婚？这少安，出得啥混帐主意！ \n　　孙玉厚尽管有大女儿不幸所带来的痛苦，其它方面我们能看到，如今没一点遗撼。就是他本人的光景，也发达多了。钱不用说，有两个小子给哩；至于粮食，村里除过金家湾那面的俊武，也许就数上他了。许多粮食都吃不了，又舍不得卖，只好用泥巴糊着封在石仓子里。麻烦的是，过一段时间又要把这些存粮倒腾到外面晾晒一下，院子里所有粗点的树木上，一年四季都挂着未划粒的玉米棒；灿黄如金，显出了殷实人家的一派大好风光。今年夏天麦子又大丰收，他支起合烙床子，叫了村中十个后生用两天时间才打完……这一段日子，孙玉厚老汉动不动就到石圪节街上来买猪肉，这倒不是嘴馋或故意给公众能他的光景而是他最近正在箍新窑。 \n　　本来，二小子早给他攒够了钱，让他去年就整修一院新地方。但大儿子当时正在难处，他便征得少平的同意，把一千多块准备整修地方的钱，先垫给了少安。 \n　　今年，不用他说，大小子主动地张罗着为他雇人打窑洞，接石窑口。当然，按少安的铺排，少平的那一千多元根本不够。短缺的钱都是少安出的，并且还不让他给少平说：因为个性强的二小子早就说过，这院新地方要他一个人出钱修建。 \n　　按他们老两口的想法，他们这个院落不必这么排场，别说少安他老了，就是他们老两口，也都是快入土的人，而家里再没有其它拖累，何必修建那么好的地方！ \n　　但大小子二小子都坚持要把这院地方修建成村里最好的。他后来也没坚持反对。他理解孩子们的心情。孙家穷困潦倒几辈子，孩子们现在为他们修建这院地方，多半是给村里人证明：孙家再不是过去的孙家了！这些日子里，全家人都忙得不可开交。尤其是他的少安，真是八下里�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
