The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh’s presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.\nYueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. / know as a doctor there was no physical reason\nagainst it. Was there some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.\nFor the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.\nJessica stopped beside him, said: “What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child.”\nHe spoke mechanically: “If only adults could relax like that.”\n“Yes,”\n“Where do we lose it?” he murmured.\nShe glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul, thinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in his life now—so very different from the life they once had planned for him.\n“We do, indeed, lose something,” she said.\nShe glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled gray-green of bushes—dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast—light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.\n“The sky’s so dark,” she said.\n“That’s partly the lack of moisture,” he said.\n“Water!” she snapped. “Everywhere you turn here, you’re involved with the lack of water!”\n“It’s the precious mystery of Arrakis,” he said.\n“Why is there so little of it? There’s volcanic rock here. There're a dozen power sources | could name.\nThere’s polar ice. They say you can’t drill in the desert—storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed, if the worms don’t get you first. They’ve never found water traces there, anyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that’ve been drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?”\n“First a trickle, then nothing,” he said.\n“But, Wellington, that’s the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?”\n“It is curious,” he said. “You suspect some living agency? Wouldn’t that have shown in core samples?”\n“What would have shown? Alien plant matter...or animal? Who could recognize it?” She turned back to the slope. “The water is stopped. Something plugs it. That’s my suspicion.”\n“Perhaps the reason’s known,” he said. “The Harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress this.”\n“What reason?” she asked. “And then there’s the atmospheric moisture. Little enough of it, certainly, but there’s some. It’s the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?”\n“The polar caps?”\n“Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind the Harkonnen veil that bear\nclose investigation, and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice.”\n“We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,” he said. “Perhaps we'll....” He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. “Is something wrong?”\n“The way you say ‘Harkonnen,’” she said. “Even my Duke’s voice doesn’t carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. | didn’t know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.”\nGreat Mother! he thought. /’ve aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me. There’s only one solution: tell the truth as far as | can.\nHe said: “You didn’t know that my wife, my Wanna....” He shrugged, unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: “They....” The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.\n“Forgive me,” Jessica said. “I did not mean to open an old wound.” And she thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit—the signs are all over him. And it’s obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here’s another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.\n“lam sorry,” he said. “I’m unable to talk about it.” He opened his eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.\nJessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a\nr\ncurved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over her.\n“Wellington, I’m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,” she said.\n“I came willingly,” he said. And that, too, was true.\n“But this whole planet’s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.”\n“It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,” he said. And that, too, was true.\n“Perhaps | should be more confident of him,” she said. “He is a brilliant tactician.”\n“We've been uprooted,” he said. “That’s why we're uneasy.”\n“And how easy it Is to kill the uprooted plant,” she said. “Especially when you put it down in hostile soil.”\n“Are we certain the soil’s hostile?”\n“There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was adding to the population,” She said. “They stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.”\n“There is only so much water to support human life here,” he said. “The people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn’t follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him.”\n“And guards,” she said. “Guards everywhere. And Shields. You see the blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.”\n“Give this planet a chance,” he said.\nBut Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. “I can smell death in this place,” she said. “Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There’ve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.’ She shook her head. “Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.”\n“You malign him.”\n“Malign? | praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. | just do not fool myself about Thufir’s methods.”\n“You should...keep busy,” he said. “Give yourself no time for such morbid—”\n“Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? | am the Duke’s secretary—so busy that each day | learn new things to fear...things even he doesn’t suspect | know.” She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: “Sometimes | wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.”\n“What do you mean?” He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose.\n“Don’t you think, Wellington,” she asked, “that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?”\n“That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.”\nThe rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt about his concubine. One\nr\nhad only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.\nShe sighed. “You're right. It’s not worthy.”\nAgain, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.\n“There’ll be much bloodshed soon,” she said. “The Harkonnens won't rest until they’re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood—no matter what the distance—while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin.”\n“The old feud,” Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or—worse— left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.\n“What are you thinking?” she asked.\n“Iam thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand solaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things.”\n“Does greed touch even you, Wellington?”\n“Not greed.”\n“What then?”\nHe shrugged. “Futility.” He glanced at her. “Can you remember your first taste of spice?”\n“It tasted like cinnamon.”\n“But never twice the same,” he said. “It’s like life —it presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable—slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.”\n“I think it would’ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach,” she said.\nHe saw that she hadn’t been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: Yes—why didn’t she make him do this? She could make him do virtually anything.\nHe spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: “Would you think it bold of me... Jessica, if | asked a personal question?”\nShe pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet. “Of course not. You’re...my friend.”\n“Why haven’t you made the Duke marry you?”\nShe whirled, head up, glaring. “Made him marry me? But—”\n“I should not have asked,” he said.\n“No.” She shrugged. “There’s good political reason —as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And....” She sighed. “...motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It\ndegrades everything it touches. If | made him do... this, then it would not be his doing.”\n“It’s a thing my Wanna might have said,” he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. “Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men. One of them | love very\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and the Duke's concubine, deeply involved in political and personal intrigues on Arrakis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is Jessica's son, undergoing rigorous training and facing a life different from what was originally planned for him>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>WELLINGTON YUEH<|>PERSON<|>Wellington Yueh is a doctor with a tragic past, bound by grief and hidden loyalties, serving the Atreides on Arrakis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>WANNA<|>PERSON<|>Wanna was Yueh's wife, a Bene Gesserit likely killed by the Harkonnens, leaving Yueh with deep-seated hatred>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>PERSON<|>Duke Leto Atreides is a brilliant tactician and leader, targeted by the Harkonnens due to an old feud and royal lineage>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>PERSON<|>The Baron Harkonnen is a ruthless enemy of the Atreides, driven by vengeance and political ambition>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>THUFIR HAWAT<|>PERSON<|>Thufir Hawat is the Duke's master of assassins, employing deceit and strategy to protect the Atreides>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet, the sole source of the spice melange, and the center of political and economic conflict>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is the former home of the Atreides, a contrast to the harsh environment of Arrakis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BATTLE OF CORRIN<|>EVENT<|>The Battle of Corrin is a historical event where an Atreides banished a Harkonnen for cowardice, fueling their feud>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with political and genetic influence across the universe>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHOAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CHOAM is a major economic entity controlling trade, including the spice melange from Arrakis>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>PAUL<|>Jessica is Paul's mother, deeply concerned about his future and training<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>DUKE LETO<|>Jessica is the Duke's concubine and secretary, bound by love and political necessity<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, trained in their ways and bound by their schemes<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>WELLINGTON YUEH<|>WANNA<|>Yueh grieves for his wife Wanna, whose death or torture by the Harkonnens haunts him<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>WELLINGTON YUEH<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>Yueh harbors deep hatred for the Baron due to Wanna's fate<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>The Duke and the Baron are locked in a deadly feud rooted in history and politics<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Duke has been assigned to govern Arrakis, a perilous and strategic position<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>THUFIR HAWAT<|>DUKE LETO<|>Hawat serves as the Duke's master of assassins, orchestrating security and subterfuge<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BATTLE OF CORRIN<|>DUKE LETO<|>The Battle of Corrin is a historical event that fuels the Atreides-Harkonnen feud<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BATTLE OF CORRIN<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>The Battle of Corrin is a historical event that fuels the Atreides-Harkonnen feud<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Arrakis and its spice are of great interest to the Bene Gesserit for their plans<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>CHOAM<|>Arrakis is the sole source of spice, making it vital to CHOAM's economic control<|>8>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
