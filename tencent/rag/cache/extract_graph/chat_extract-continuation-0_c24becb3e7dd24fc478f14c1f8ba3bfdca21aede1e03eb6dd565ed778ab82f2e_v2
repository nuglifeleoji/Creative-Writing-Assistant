Now my other dreams are suspect.”\n“Leto...” She shook her head, eyes damp. “It came later for our father. Don’t you think it might be—”\n“I’ve dreamed myself enclosed in armor and racing across the dunes,” he said. “And I’ve been to Jacurutu.”\n“Jacu...” She cleared her throat. “That old myth!”\n“A real place. Ghani! | must find this man they call The Preacher. | must find him and question him.”\n“You think he’s ... our father?”\n“Ask yourself that question.”\n“It'd be just like him,” she agreed, “but...”\n“| don’t like the things | know I'll do,” he said. “For the first time in my life | understand my father.”\nShe felt excluded from his thoughts, said: “The Preacher’s probably just an old mystic.”\n“I pray for that,” he whispered. “Oh, how | pray for that!” He rocked forward, got to his feet. The baliset hummed in his hand as he moved. “Would that he were only Gabriel without a horn.” He stared silently at the moonlit desert.\nShe turned to look where he looked, saw the foxfire glow of rotting vegetation at the edge of the sietch plantings, then the clean blending into lines of dunes. That was a living place out there. Even when the desert slept, something remained awake in it. She sensed that wakefulness, hearing animals below her drinking at the qanat. Leto’s revelation had transformed the night: this was a living moment, a time to discover regularities within perpetual change, an instant in which to feel that long movement from their Terranic past, all of it encapsulated in her memories.\n“Why Jacurutu?” she asked, and the flatness of her tone shattered the mood.\n“Why ...1 don’t know. When Stilgar first told us how they killed the people there and made the place tabu, |\nthought... what you thought. But danger comes from there now ...and The Preacher.”\nShe didn’t respond, didn’t demand that he share more of his prescient dreams with her, and she knew how much this told him of her terror. That way led to Abomination and they both knew it. The word hung unspoken between them as he turned and led the way back over the rocks to the sietch entrance. Abomination.\nThe Universe is God’s. It is one thing, a wholeness against which all separations may be identified. Transient life, even that self-aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness.\n—COMMENTARIES FROM THE C.E.T. (COMMISSION OF ECUMENICAL TRANSLATORS)\nH alleck used hand signals to convey the actual message while speaking aloud of other matters. He didn’t like the Small anteroom the priests had assigned for this report, knowing it would be crawling with spy devices. Let them try to break the tiny hand signals, though. The Atreides had used this means of communication for centuries without anyone the wiser.\nNight had fallen outside, but the room had no windows, depending upon glowglobes at the upper corners.\n“Many of those we took were Alia’s people,” Halleck signaled, watching Jessica’s face as he spoke aloud, telling her the interrogation still continued.\n“It was as you anticipated then,” Jessica replied, her fingers winking. She nodded and spoke an open reply: “IIl expect a full report when you're satisfied, Gurney.”\n“Of course, My Lady,” he said, and his fingers continued: “There is another thing, quite disturbing. Under the deep drugs, some of our captives talked of Jacurutu and, as they spoke the name, they died.”\n“A conditioned heart-stopper?” Jessica’s fingers asked. And she said: “Have you released any of the captives?”\n“A few, My Lady—the more obvious culls.” And his fingers darted: “We suspect a heart-compulsion but are not yet certain. The autopsies aren’t completed. | thought you\nshould know about this thing of Jacurutu, however, and came immediately.”\n“My Duke and | always thought Jacurutu an interesting legend probably based on fact,” Jessica’s fingers said, and she ignored the usual tug of sorrow as she spoke of her long-dead love.\n“Do you have orders?” Halleck asked, speaking aloud.\nJessica answered in kind, telling him to return to the landing field and report when he had positive information, but her fingers conveyed another message: “Resume contact with your friends among the smugglers. If Jacurutu exists, they’ll support themselves by selling spice. There’d be no other market for them except the smugglers.”\nHalleck bowed his head briefly while his fingers said: “I’ve already set this course in motion, My Lady.” And because he could not ignore the training of a lifetime, added: “Be very careful in this place. Alia is your enemy and most of the priesthood belongs to her.”\n“Not Javid,” Jessica’s fingers responded. “He hates the Atreides. | doubt anyone but an adept could detect it, but I’m positive of it. He conspires and Alia doesn’t know of it.”\n“I’m assigning additional guards to your person,” Halleck said, speaking aloud, avoiding the light spark of displeasure which Jessica’s eyes betrayed. “There are dangers, I’m certain. Will you spend the night here?”\n“We'll go later to Sietch Tabr,” she said and hesitated, on the point of telling him not to send more guards, but she held her silence. Gurney’s instincts were to be trusted. More than one Atreides had learned this, both to his pleasure and his sorrow. “I have one more meeting—with the Master of Novitiates this time,” she said. “That’s the last one and I'll be happily shut of this place.”\nAnd | beheld another beast coming up out of the sand; and he had two horns like a lamb, but his mouth was fanged and fiery as the dragon and his body shimmered and burned with great heat while it did hiss like the serpent.\n—REVISED ORANGE CATHOLIC BIBLE\nH e called himself The Preacher, and there had come to be an awesome fear among many on Arrakis that he might be Muad’Dib returned from the desert, not dead at all. Muad’Dib could be alive; for who had seen his body? For that matter, who saw any body that the desert took? But still—Muad’Dib? Points of comparison could be made, although no one from the old days came forward and said: “Yes, | see that this is Muad’Dib. | know him.”\nStill... Like Muad’Dib, The Preacher was blind, his eye sockets black and scarred in a way that could have been done by a stone burner. And his voice conveyed that crackling penetration, that same compelling force which demanded a response from deep within you. Many remarked this. He was lean, this Preacher, his leathery face seamed, his hair grizzled. But the deep desert did that to many people. You had only to look about you and see this proven. And there was another fact for contention: The Preacher was led by a young Fremen, a lad without known sietch who said, when questioned, that he worked for hire. It was argued that Muad’Dib, knowing the future, had not needed such a guide except at the very end, when his grief overcame him. But he’d needed a guide then; everyone knew it.\nThe Preacher had appeared one winter morning in the streets of Arrakeen, a brown and ridge-veined hand on the\nshoulder of his young guide. The lad, who gave his name as Assan Tariq, moved through the flint-smelling dust of the early swarming, leading his charge with the practiced agility of the warren-born, never once losing contact.\nIt was observed that the blind man wore a traditional bourka over a stillsuit which bore the mark about it of those once made only in the sietch caves of the deepest desert. It wasn’t like the shabby suits being turned out these days. The nose tube which captured moisture from his breath for the recycling layers beneath the bourka was wrapped in braid, and it was the black vine braid so seldom seen anymore. The suit’s mask across the lower half of his face carried green patches etched by the blown sand. All in all, this Preacher was a figure from Dune’s past.\nMany among the early crowds of that winter day had noted his passage. After all, a blind Fremen remained a rarity. Fremen Law still consigned the blind to Shai-Hulud. The wording of the Law, although it was less honored in these modern, water-soft times, remained unchanged from the earliest days. The blind were a gift to Shai-Hulud. They were to be exposed in the open bled for the great worms to devour. When it was done—and there were stories which got back to the cities—it was always done out where the largest worms still ruled, those called Old Men of the Desert. A blind Fremen, then, was a curiosity, and people paused to watch the passing of this odd pair.\nThe lad appeared about fourteen standard, one of the new breed who wore modified stillsuits; it left the face open to the moisture-robbing air. He had slender features, the all- blue spice-tinted eyes, a nubbin nose, and that innocuous look of innocence which so often masks cynical knowledge in the young. In contrast, the blind man was a reminder of times almost forgotten—long in stride and with a wiriness that spoke of many years on the sand with only his feet or a captive worm to carry him. He held his head in that stiff- necked rigidity which some of the blind cannot put off. The\nhooded head moved only when he cocked an ear at an interesting sound.\nThrough the day’s gathering crowds the strange pair came, arriving at last on the steps which led up like terraced hectares to the escarpment which was Alia’s Temple, a fitting companion to Paul’s Keep. Up the steps The Preacher went until he and his young guide came to the third landing, where pilgrims of the Hajj awaited the morning opening of those gigantic doors above them. They were doors large enough to have admitted an entire cathedral from one of the ancient religions. Passing through them was said to reduce a pilgrim’s soul to motedom, sufficiently small that it could pass through the eye of a needle and enter heaven.\nAt the edge of the third landing The Preacher turned, and it was as though he looked about him, seeing with his empty eye sockets the foppish city dwellers, some of them Fremen, with garments which simulated stillsuits but were only decorative fabrics, seeing the eager pilgrims fresh off the Guild space transports and awaiting that first step on the devotion which would ensure them a place in paradise.\nThe landing was a noisy place: there were Mahdi Spirit Cultists in green robes and carrying live hawks trained to screech a “call to heaven.” Food was being sold by shouting vendors. Many things were being offered for sale, the voices shouting in competitive stridence: there was the Dune Tarot with its booklets of commentaries imprinted on shigawire. One vendor had exotic bits of cloth “guaranteed to have been touched by Muad’Dib himself!” Another had v\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GHANI<|>PERSON<|>Ghani is a character who shares a conversation with Leto about prescient dreams and the search for The Preacher)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a character who experiences prescient dreams and seeks The Preacher, possibly his father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is mentioned as someone who informed Leto and Ghani about their grandmother's delay and the history of Jacurutu)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>PERSON<|>The Preacher is a mysterious blind man who may be Muad'Dib returned from the desert, sought by Leto for answers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACURUTU<|>GEO<|>Jacurutu is a place mentioned as a myth but revealed to be real, associated with danger and The Preacher)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen community where Jessica plans to spend the night)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>GEO<|>Arrakeen is a city on Arrakis where The Preacher appears with his young guide)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA'S TEMPLE<|>GEO<|>Alia's Temple is a significant religious structure on Arrakis, visited by pilgrims)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL'S KEEP<|>GEO<|>Paul's Keep is a notable location on Arrakis, mentioned alongside Alia's Temple)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALLECK<|>PERSON<|>Halleck is a loyal retainer to Jessica, using hand signals to communicate secretly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a key figure, involved in political and personal intrigues, and mother to Leto and Ghani)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAVID<|>PERSON<|>Javid is a priest who hates the Atreides and conspires against Alia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is Jessica's enemy and a powerful figure in the priesthood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSAN TARIQ<|>PERSON<|>Assan Tariq is the young guide who leads The Preacher through Arrakeen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>PERSON<|>Muad'Dib is a legendary figure, possibly The Preacher, who once ruled Arrakis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GHANI<|>Leto and Ghani are siblings discussing prescient dreams and their father<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>THE PREACHER<|>Leto seeks The Preacher, believing he might be his father<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANI<|>THE PREACHER<|>Ghani questions if The Preacher is their father<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>LETO<|>Stilgar informs Leto about their grandmother's delay and Jacurutu<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>GHANI<|>Stilgar informs Ghani about their grandmother's delay and Jacurutu<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>HALLECK<|>Jessica and Halleck communicate secretly about political matters<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>ALIA<|>Jessica and Alia are enemies, with Alia plotting against her<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>JAVID<|>Jessica detects Javid's hatred for the Atreides and his conspiracy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>ASSAN TARIQ<|>The Preacher is guided by Assan Tariq through Arrakeen<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>MUAD'DIB<|>The Preacher is speculated to be Muad'Dib returned from the desert<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACURUTU<|>THE PREACHER<|>Jacurutu is associated with danger and The Preacher<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>JESSICA<|>Jessica plans to spend the night at Sietch Tabr<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
