This situation is exacerbated by a lack of effective leadership or support, which has left many of them vulnerable. Despite these challenges, the children are organized into two groups that hold differing opinions about the future of their country, showcasing their ability to engage in critical discussions about societal issues.\n\nOverall, the role of children in this context is multifaceted; they are not only participants in governance but also active contributors to societal recovery, all while navigating the complexities of their circumstances in the aftermath of a disaster.
