��艳的闪电不时在空中曲折地划过；雷声和狂风暴雨搅在一起，震耳欲聋。不多一会，就听见沟沟渠渠里传来了滔滔的流水声。 \n　　不到半个钟头，大沟道里就起水了。混浊的泥浪翻滚着跟头，吼叫着从后沟道里冲了出来！ \n　　在一片混乱的暴风雨中，沟道里突然传来了侯玉英尖锐的哭喊声！ \n　　少平缩在一个小山窑里，透过雨帘，看见洪水已快要涨到侯玉英避雨的那个石崖下了。跛女子正哭喊着，两手揪着旁边土台子上的几棵丛草，企图爬上去逃命。但由于腿不干练，加上泥地溜滑，三番五次爬上去又跌了下来！ \n　　孙少平知道，也许用不了多少时间，洪水就会淹没到那个石崖下，把跛女子一浪卷走！ \n　　他立刻从自己那个干燥的小土窑里冲出去，冒着瓢泼似的暴雨，踏崖溜洼地往沟底跑去。 \n　　孙少平不知摔了多少跤，才到了怒吼的洪水边。身上浸透了泥水，头发和脸也被泥糊得五麻六道。 \n　　他来到洪水边，一筹莫展了。侯玉英隔在河对面，他不得过去。他尽管在洪水中游过泳，但那是在原西河里——那水宽阔，也平稳，到河对面上岸选择余地大。可这是道小沟，水急浪险，要游过去太困难了！ \n　　这时候，洪水已经漫上了侯玉英正挣命的那个石崖边上。跛女子的手死揪住土台子上面的丛草，两只脚已经挨着洪水边了。她现在只是绝望地呼喊着：“救命啊！救命啊！”少平在暴风雨中大声向对岸喊：“你先坚持一下，我过来了！” \n　　他喊了一声后，就扑入了洪水之中——一个浪头很快把他整个吞没了…… \n　　还好，他又钻出了水面！他眼睛什么也看不见，只凭本能向对岸拼命游去。 \n　　谢天谢地，他终于上岸了！他用手摸了一把脸上的泥水，就撒开腿朝那个土台上面跑去。 \n　　他来到土台子上面，看见洪水已经淹没了侯玉英的下半身，如果不是她两手死死揪着丛草，恐怕早让水卷走了！少平飞快伸出手，把她从土台子下面拉上来。 \n　　侯玉英一扑踏趴在土台子上，放开声嚎了！这哭声是庆贺她的生命得救，也是对救她命的人表示她的感激之情！ \n　　当孙少平游过河对岸的时候，全班男女同学都纷纷从山洼上跑下来了。他们站在暴雨中的洪水边上，隔着翻滚咆哮的浊浪，心怦怦地跳着，扬着手，喊叫着，象看一幕惊险的戏剧，眼看着少\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
