Leto II, a near-immortal ruler with vast prescient abilities, found in Hwi a rare individual he could trust completely. He shared deep secrets and strategic plans with her, demonstrating a connection that transcended mere companionship. Hwi’s presence provided Leto II with a sense of humanity and vulnerability, qualities he had long suppressed in his millennia-long reign.  \n\nHer death had a devastating impact on Leto II, underscoring the depth of his attachment to her. While he was often perceived as an unyielding and calculating ruler, his grief over Hwi revealed his capacity for profound emotional suffering. Their bond highlights a pivotal aspect of Leto II’s character—his ability to love and mourn despite his godlike detachment.  \n\nIn summary, Hwi Noree was not only Leto II’s cherished companion but also a confidante who influenced his actions and emotions in ways few others could. Her loss left an indelible mark on him, emphasizing the duality of his existence as both a ruler and a being capable of deep personal connection.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751252027, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 254, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 433, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
