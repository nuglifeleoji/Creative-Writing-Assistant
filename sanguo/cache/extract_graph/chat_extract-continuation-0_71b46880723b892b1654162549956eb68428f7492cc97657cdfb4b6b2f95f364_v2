清风而去。角得此书，晓夜攻习，能呼风唤雨，号为“太平道人”。中平元年正月内，疫气流行，张角散施符水，为人治病，自称“大贤良师”。角有徒弟五百余人，云游四方，皆能书符念咒。次后徒众日多，角乃立三十六方，大方万余人，小方六七千，各立渠帅，称为将军；讹言：“苍天已死，黄天当立；岁在甲子，天下大吉。”令人各以白土书“甲子”二字于家中大门上。青、幽、徐、冀、荆、扬、兖、豫八州之人，家家侍奉大贤良师张角名字。角遣其党马元义，暗赍金帛，结交中涓封谞，以为内应。角与二弟商议曰：“至难得者，民心也。今民心已顺，若不乘势取天下，诚为可惜。”遂一面私造黄旗，约期举事；一面使弟子唐周，驰书报封谞。唐周乃径赴省中告变。帝召大将军何进调兵擒马元义，斩之；次收封谞等一干人下狱。张角闻知事露，星夜举兵，自称“天公将军”，张宝称“地公将军”，张梁称“人公将军”。申言于众曰：“今汉运将终，大圣人出。汝等皆宜顺天从正，以乐太平。”四方百姓，裹黄巾从张角反者四五十万。贼势浩大，官军望风而靡。何进奏帝火速降诏，令各处备御，讨贼立功。一面遣中郎将卢植、皇甫嵩、朱儁，各引精兵、分三路讨之。\n\n
