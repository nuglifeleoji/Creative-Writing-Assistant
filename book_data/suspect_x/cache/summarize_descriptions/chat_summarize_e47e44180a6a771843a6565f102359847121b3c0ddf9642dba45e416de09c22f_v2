Following the fall of House Atreides, Hawat was forced to work under duress for the Harkonnens, though his loyalty to the Atreides remained evident. Despite this, Paul Atreides continued to trust Hawat, even defending him after an assassination attempt, demonstrating his belief in Hawat’s abilities and integrity.  \n\nHawat played a crucial role in mentoring Paul, training him in strategy, politics, and the complexities of ruling Arrakis. As a Mentat Master of Assassins, he also instructed Paul in survival tactics and military leadership, shaping him into a formidable leader.
