其他学员都走了，副院长笑眯眯地向蓝轩宇招了招手，道：“你跟我来。”蓝轩宇并不认识他，但很明显，在场的老师中，这位是为首的，这一点蓝轩宇还是看得出来的，赶忙走上前去。季洪彬也跟在副院长身边向外走去。\n\n    “你来干吗?”副院长没好气地看向他。季洪彬冷冷地道：“监督一下，省得你把孩子教坏了。”“老季，你是不是有毛病?”副院长大怒，脸上的笑容瞬间消失。\n\n    季洪彬道：“难道你还打算教出来一个跟你一样的混世魔王不成？”“哼！”副院长脸色变了变，哼了一声，却没有反驳，大步向外走去。蓝轩宇觉得有些莫名其妙，这究竟是什么情况？这位是谁啊?看季老师的意思，怎么好像不太靠谱?矮胖的副院长走在前面，季洪彬和他并肩前行，蓝轩宇老老实实地跟在后面。\n\n    三人乘坐电梯，一直来到学院主教学楼的顶层。副院长带着他们走进了一间宽敞的办公室。\n\n    整间办公室至少有两百平方米，不但有沙发、桌案和书柜，还有一些精致的植物，其中书柜尤其多。当今魂导科技发达，纸质书已经成为稀有物品。\n\n    很显然，这位副院长对这些纸质书情有独钟。能够保存到现在的纸质书，都可以用“文物”来形容了，价值绝对不菲。\n\n    副院长看了季洪彬一眼：“你难道要一直旁听？”季洪彬毫不客气地走到沙发旁坐了下来，也不理他。\n\n    副院长双手叉腰，似乎是要发作，可最终还是忍了下来，向蓝轩宇招招手：“来，小子，到我面前来。”\n\n    蓝轩宇老老实实地走了过去。\n\n    副院长的身高在一米七左右，体重怎么看也有两百斤，身材臃肿，但一双小眼睛总是笑眯眯的，给人一种亲切的感觉。\n\n    “说说吧，今天在迷宫里，你是怎么想到要用那种战术的?？”副院长淡淡地问道。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“我就是觉得，在迷宫之中，谁也不知道会遇到什么情况。迷宫我们都不熟悉，也不知道会不会同时遇到很多同学。这既然是考核，老师们应该不会让我们完全找不到其他同学，甚至会比较容易找到。那我们不如就以逸待劳，如果等其他同学打得差不多了再出去，自然就有更大的机会获得胜利。”\n\n    副院长满意地点了点头：“战术对头，用脑子了，不错。你的武魂可以对钱磊和刘锋产生增幅？”\n\n    蓝轩宇点了点头，道：“好像是这样的。不过，老师，我也不知道最后那一吼是怎么回事。好像是受到了班长的黄金狮子吼的压迫，特别难受，然后就叫了出来。”副院长\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a
