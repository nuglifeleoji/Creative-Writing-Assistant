mental adjustment by Teg, but he felt familiar with them now and moved the attack with facility and frequent inspiration.\nA simmering Lucilla glanced into the hall occasionally. She watched and then left without comment. Teg did not know what Duncan was doing about the Imprinter but there was a feeling that the reawakened ghola played a delaying game with his seductress. She would not allow that to continue long, Teg knew, but it was out of his hands. Duncan no\nlonger was “too young” for the Imprinter. That young body carried a mature male mind with experiences from which to make his own decisions.\nDuncan and Teg had been on the floor with only one break all morning. Hunger pangs gnawed at Teg but he felt reluctant to halt the session. Duncan’s abilities had climbed to a new level today and he was still improving.\nTeg, seated in a fixed console’s cage seat, twisted the attack forces into a complex maneuver, striking from left, right, and above.\nThe Harkonnen armory had produced an abundance of these exotic weapons and training instruments, some of which Teg had known only from historical accounts. Duncan knew them all, apparently, and with an intimacy that Teg admired. Hunter-seekers geared to penetrate a force shield were part of the shadow system they used now.\n“They automatically slow down to go through the shield,” Duncan explained in his young-old voice. “Too fast a strike, of course, and the shield repels.”\n“Shields of that type have almost gone out of fashion,” Teg said. “A few societies maintain them as a kind of sport but otherwise...”\nDuncan executed a riposte of blurred speed that dropped three hunter-seekers to the floor damaged enough to require the no-globe’s maintenance services. He removed the cage and damped the system but left it idling while he came over to Teg, breathing deeply but easily. Looking past Teg, Duncan smiled and nodded. Teg whirled but there was only the flick of Lucilla’s gown as she left them.\n“It’s like a duel,” Duncan said. “She tries to thrust through my guard and | counterattack.”\n“Have a care,” Teg said. “That’s a full Reverend Mother.”\n“I’ve known a few of them in my time, Bashar.”\nOnce more, Teg found himself confounded. He had been warned that he would have to readjust to this different Duncan Idaho but he had not fully anticipated the constant\nmental demands of that readjustment. The look in Duncan’s eyes right now was disconcerting.\n“Our roles are changed a bit, Bashar,” Duncan said. He picked up a towel from the floor and mopped his face.\n“I’m no longer sure of what I can teach you,” Teg admitted. He wished, though, that Duncan would take his warning about Lucilla. Did Duncan imagine that the Reverend Mothers of those ancient days were identical with the women of today? Teg thought that highly unlikely. In the way of all other life, the Sisterhood evolved and changed.\nIt was obvious to Teg that Duncan had come to a decision about his place in Taraza’s machinations. Duncan was not merely biding his time. He was training his body to a personally chosen peak and he had made a judgment about the Bene Gesserit.\nHe has made that judgment on insufficient data, Teg thought.\nDuncan dropped the towel and looked at it for a moment. “Let me be the judge of what you can teach me, Bashar.” He turned and stared narrowly at Teg seated in the cage.\nTeg inhaled deeply. He smelled the faint ozone from all of this durable Harkonnen equipment ticking away in readiness for Duncan’s return to action. The ghola’s perspiration carried a bitter dominant.\nDuncan sneezed.\nTeg sniffed, recognizing the omnipresent dust of their activities. It could be more tasted than smelled at times. Alkaline. Over it all was the fragrance of the air scrubbers and oxy regenerators. There was a distinct floral aroma built into the system but Teg could not identify the flower. In the month of their occupation, the globe also had taken on human odors, slowly insinuated into the original composite —perspiration, cooking smells, the never-quite-suppressed acridity of waste reclamation. To Teg, these reminders of their presence were oddly offensive. And he found himself sniffing and listening for sounds of intrusion—something\nmore than the echoing passage of their own footsteps and the subdued metallic clashings from the kitchen area.\nDuncan’s voice intruded: “You’re an odd man, Bashar.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“There’s your resemblance to the Duke Leto. The facial identity is weird. He was a bit shorter than you but the identity .. .” He shook his head, thinking of the Bene Gesserit designs behind those genetic markers in Teg’s face —that hawk look, the crease lines and that inner thing, that certainty of moral superiority.\nHow moral and how superior?\nAccording to the records he had seen at the Keep (and Duncan was sure they had been placed there especially for him to discover) Teg’s reputation was an almost universal thing throughout human society of this age. At the Battle of Markon, it had been enough for the enemy to know that Teg was there opposite them in person. They sued for terms. Was that true?\nDuncan looked at Teg in the console cage and put this question to him.\n“Reputation can be a beautiful weapon,” Teg said. “It often spills less blood.”\n“At Arbelough, why did you go to the front with your troops?” Duncan asked.\nTeg showed surprise. “Where did you learn that?”\n“At the Keep. You might have been killed. What would that have served?”\nTeg reminded himself that this young flesh standing over him held unknown knowledge, which must guide Duncan’s quest for information. It was in that unknown area, Teg suspected, that Duncan was most valuable to the Sisterhood.\n“We took severe losses at Arbelough on the preceding two days,” Teg said. “I failed to make a correct assessment of the enemy’s fear and fanaticism.”\n“But the risk of...”\n“My presence at the front said to my own people: ‘I share your risks.’”\n“The Keep’s records said Arbelough had been perverted by Face Dancers. Patrin told me you vetoed your aides when they urged you to sweep the planet clean, sterilize it and—”\n“You were not there, Duncan.”\n“lam trying to be. So you spared your enemy against all advice.”\n“Except for the Face Dancers.”\n“But then you walked unarmed through the enemy ranks and before they had laid down their weapons.”\n“To assure them they would not be mistreated.”\n“That was very dangerous.”\n“Was it? Many of them came over to us for the final assault on Kroinin where we broke the anti-Sisterhood forces.”\nDuncan stared hard at Teg. Not only did this old Bashar resemble Duke Leto in appearance, but he also had that same Atreides charisma: a legendary figure even among his former enemies. Teg had said he was descended from Ghanima of the Atreides, but there had to be more in it than that. The ways of the Bene Gesserit breeding mastery awed him.\n“We will go back to the practice now,” Duncan said.\n“Don’t damage yourself.”\n“You forget, Bashar. | remember a body as young as this one and right here on Giedi Prime.”\n“Gammu!”\n“It was properly renamed but my body still recalls the Original. That is why they sent me here. | know it.”\nOf course he would know it, Teg thought.\nRestored by the brief respite, Teg introduced a new element in the attack and sent a sudden burn-line against Duncan’s left side.\nHow easily Duncan parried the attack!\nHe was using an oddly mixed variation on the five attitudes, each response seemingly invented before it was required.\n“Each attack is a feather floating on the infinite road,” Duncan said. His voice gave no hint of exertion. “As the feather approaches, it is diverted and removed.”\nAs he spoke, he parried the shifting attack and countered.\nTeg’s Mentat logic followed the movements into what he recognized as dangerous places. Dependencies and key logs!\nDuncan shifted over to attack, moving ahead of it, pacing his movements rather than responding. Teg was forced to his utmost abilities as the shadow forces burned and flickered across the floor. Duncan’s weaving figure in its mobile cage danced along the space between them. Not one of Teg’s hunter-seekers or burn-line counters touched the moving figure. Duncan was over them, under them, seeming totally unafraid of the real pain that this equipment could bring him.\nOnce more, Duncan increased the speed of his attack.\nA bolt of pain shot up Teg’s left arm from his hand on the controls to his shoulder.\nWith a sharp exclamation, Duncan shut down the equipment. “Sorry, Bashar. That was superb defense on your part but I’m afraid age defeated you.”\nOnce more, Duncan crossed the floor and stood over Teg.\n“A little pain to remind me of the pain | caused you,” Teg said. He rubbed his tingling arm.\n“Blame the heat of the moment,” Duncan said. “We have done enough for now.”\n“Not quite,” Teg said. “It is not enough to strengthen only your muscles.”\nAt Teg’s words, Duncan felt an alerting sensation throughout his body. He sensed the disorganized touch of that uncompleted thing that the reawakening had failed to\narouse. Something crouched within him, Duncan thought. It was like a coiled spring waiting for release.\n“What more would you do?” Duncan asked. His voice sounded hoarse.\n“Your survival is in the balance here,” Teg said. “All of this is being done to save you and get you to Rakis.”\n“For Bene Gesserit reasons, which you say you do not know!”\n“| don’t know them, Duncan.”\n“But you're a Mentat.”\n“Mentats require data to make projections.”\n“Do you think Lucilla knows?”\n“I’m not sure but let me warn you again about her. She has orders to get you to Rakis prepared for what you must do there.”\n“Must?” Duncan shook his head from side to side. “Am | not my own person with rights to make my own choices? What do you think you’ve reawakened here, a damned Face Dancer capable only of obeying orders?”\n“Are you telling me you will not go to Rakis?”\n“I’m telling you I will make my own decisions when | know what it is I’m to do. I’m not a hired assassin.”\n“You think | am, Duncan?”\n“I think you’re an honorable man, someone to be admired. Give me credit for having my own standards of duty and honor.”\n“You've been given another chance at life and—”\n“But you are not my father and Lucilla is not my mother. Imprinter? For what does she hope to prepare me?”\n“It may be that she does not know, Duncan. Like me, she may have only part of the design. Knowing how the Sisterhood works, that is highly likely.”\n“So the two of you just train me and deliver me to Arrakis. Here’s the package you ordered!”\n“This is a far different universe than the one where you were originally born,” Teg said. “As it was in your day, we\nstill have a Great Convention against atomics and the pseudo-atomics of lasgunshield interaction. We still say that sneak attacks are forbidden. There are pieces of paper scattered around to which we have put our names and we\n“But the no-ships have changed the basis for all of those treaties,” Duncan said. “I think | learned my", " of duty and honor.”\n“You've been given another chance at life and—”\n“But you are not my father and Lucilla is not my mother. Imprinter? For what does she hope to prepare me?”\n“It may be that she does not know, Duncan. Like me, she may have only part of the design. Knowing how the Sisterhood works, that is highly likely.”\n“So the two of you just train me and deliver me to Arrakis. Here’s the package you ordered!”\n“This is a far different universe than the one where you were originally born,” Teg said. “As it was in your day, we\nstill have a Great Convention against atomics and the pseudo-atomics of lasgunshield interaction. We still say that sneak attacks are forbidden. There are pieces of paper scattered around to which we have put our names and we\n“But the no-ships have changed the basis for all of those treaties,” Duncan said. “I think | learned my history fairly well at the Keep. Tell me, Bashar, why did Paul’s son have the Tleilaxu provide him with my ghola-self, hundreds of me! for all those thousands of years?”\n“Paul’s son?”\n“The Keep’s records call him the God Emperor. You name him Tyrant.”\n“Oh. | don’t think we know why he did it. Perhaps he was lonely for someone from—”\n“You brought me back to confront the worm!” Duncan said.\nIs that what we're doing? Teg wondered. He had considered this possibility more than once, but it was only a possibility, not a projection. Even so, there had to be something more in Taraza’s design. Teg sensed this with every fiber of his Mentat training. Did Lucilla know? Teg did not delude himself that he could pry revelation from a full Reverend Mother. No... he would have to bide his time, wait and watch and listen. In his own way, this obviously was what Duncan had decided. It was a dangerous course if he thwarted Lucilla!\nTeg shook his head. “Truly, Duncan, | do not know.”\n“But you follow orders.”\n“By my oath to the Sisterhood.”\n“Deceptions, dishonesties—those are empty words when the question is the Sisterhood’s survival,” Duncan quoted him.\n“Yes, | said that,” Teg agreed.\n“I trust you now because you said it,” Duncan said. “But | do not trust Lucilla.”\nTeg dropped his chin to his breast. Dangerous... dangerous...\nMuch more slowly than once he had done, Teg brought his attention out of such thoughts and went through the mental cleansing process, concentrating on the necessities laid upon him by Taraza.\n“You are my Bashar.”\nDuncan studied the Bashar for a moment. Fatigue lines were obvious on the old man’s face. Duncan was reminded suddenly of Teg’s great age, wondering if it ever tempted men such as Teg to seek out the Tleilaxu and become gholas. Probably not. They knew they might become Tleilaxu puppets.\nThis thought flooded Duncan’s awareness, holding him immobile so plainly that Teg, lifting his gaze, saw it at once.\n“Is something wrong?”\n“The Tleilaxu have done something to me, something that has not yet been exposed,” Duncan husked.\n“Exactly what we feared!” It was Lucilla speaking from the doorway behind Teg. She advanced to within two paces of Duncan. “I have been listening. You two are very informative.”\nTeg spoke quickly, hoping to blunt the anger he sensed in her. “He has mastered the seven attitudes today.”\n“He strikes like fire,” Lucilla said, “but remember that we of the Sisterhood flow like water and fill in every place.” She glanced down at Teg. “Do you not see that our ghola has gone beyond the attitudes?”\n“No fixed position, no attitude,” Duncan said.\nTeg looked up sharply at Duncan, who stood with his head erect, his forehead smooth, his eyes clear as he returned Teg’s gaze. Duncan had grown surprisingly in the short time since being awakened to his original memories.\n“Damn you, Miles!” Lucilla muttered.\nBut Teg kept his attention on Duncan. The youth’s entire body seemed wired to a new kind of vigor. There was a\npoise about him that had not been there before.\nDuncan shifted his attention to Lucilla. “You think you will fail in your assignment?”\n“Surely not,” she said. “You’re still a male.”\nAnd she thought: Yes, that young body must flow hot with the juices of procreation. Indeed, the hormonal igniters are all intact and susceptible to arousing. His present stance, though, and the way he looked at her, forced her to raise her awareness to new, energy-demanding levels.\n“What have the Tleilaxu done to you?” she demanded.\nDuncan spoke with a flippancy that he did not feel: “O Great Imprinter, if | knew | would tell you.”\n“You think it’s a game we play?” she demanded.\n“I do not know what it is we play at!”\n“By now, many people know we are not on Rakis where we would have been expected to flee,” she said.\n“And Gammu swarms with people returned from the Scattering,” Teg said. “They have the numbers to explore many possibilities here.”\n“Who would suspect the existence of a lost no-globe from the Harkonnen days?” Duncan asked.\n“Anyone who made the association between Rakis and Dar-es-Balat,” Teg said.\n“If you think this is a game, consider the urgencies of the play,” Lucilla said. She pivoted on one foot to concentrate on Teg. “And you have disobeyed Taraza!”\n“You are wrong! | have done exactly what she ordered me to do. | am her Bashar and you forget how well she knows me.”\nWith an abruptness that shocked her to silence, the subtleties of Taraza’s maneuverings impressed themselves upon Lucilla...\nWe are pawns!\nWhat a delicate touch Taraza always demonstrated in the way she moved her pawns about. Lucilla did not feel diminished by the realization that she was a pawn. That was\nknowledge bred and trained into every Reverend Mother of the Sisterhood. Even Teg knew it. Not diminished, no. The thing around them had escalated in Lucilla’s awareness. She felt awed by Teg’s words. How shallow had been her previous view of the forces within which they were enmeshed. It was as though she had seen only the surface of a turbulent river and, from that, had glimpsed the currents beneath. Now, however, she felt the flow all around her and a dismaying realization.\nPawns are expendable.\nBy your belief in singularities, in granular absolutes, you deny movement, even the movement of evolution! While you cause a granular universe to persist in your awareness, you are blind to movement. When things change, your absolute universe vanishes, no longer accessible to your self- limiting perceptions. The universe has moved beyond you.\n—FIRST DRAFT, ATREIDES MANIFESTO, BENE GRESSERIT ARCHIVES\naraza put her hands beside her temples, palms flat in\nfront of her ears, and pressed inward. Even her fingers could feel the tiredness in there: right between the hands— fatigue. A brief flicker of eyelids and she fell into the relaxation trance. Hands against head were the sole focal points of fleshly awareness.\nOne hundred heartbeats.\nShe had practiced this regularly since learning it as a child, one of her first Bene Gesserit skills. Exactly one hundred heartbeats. After all of those years of practice, her body could pace them automatically by an unconscious metronome.\nWhen she opened her eyes at the count of one hundred, her head felt better. She hoped she would have at least two more hours in which to work before fatigue overcame her once more. Those one hundred heartbeats had given her extra years of wakefulness in her lifetime.\nTonight, though, thinking of that old trick sent her memories spiraling backward. She found herself caught in her own childhood, the dormitory with the Sister Proctor pacing the aisle at night to make sure they all remained properly asleep in their beds.\nSister Baram, the Night Proctor.\nTaraza had not thought of that name in years. Sister Baram had been short and fat, a failed Reverend Mother. Not for any immediately visible reason, but the Medical Sisters and their Suk doctors had found something. Baram had never been permitted to try the spice agony. She had been quite forthcoming about what she knew of her defect. It had been discovered while she was still in her teens: periodic nerve tremors, which manifested when she began to sink into sleep. A symptom of something deeper that had caused her to be sterilized. The tremors made Baram wakeful in the night. Aisle patrol was a logical assignment.\nBaram had other weaknesses not detected by her superiors. A wakeful child toddling to the washroom could lure Baram into low-voiced conversation. Naive questions elicited mostly naive answers, but sometimes Baram imparted useful knowledge. She had taught Taraza the relaxation trick.\nOne of the older girls had found Sister Baram dead in the washroom one morning. The Night Proctor’s tremors had been the symptom of a fatal defect, a fact important mostly to the Breeding Mistresses and their endless records.\nBecause the Bene Gesserit did not usually schedule the full “solo death education” until well into the acolyte stage, Sister Baram was the first dead person Taraza had seen. Sister Baram’s body had been found partly beneath a washbasin, the right cheek pressed to the tile floor, her left hand caught in the plumbing under a sink. She had tried to pull her failing body upright and death had caught her in the attempt, exposing that last motion like an insect caught in amber.\nWhen they rolled Sister Baram over to carry her away, Taraza saw the red mark where a cheek had been pressed to the floor. The Day Proctor explained this mark with a scientific practicality. Any experience could be turned into data for these potential Reverend Mothers to incorporate later into their acolyte “Conversations With Death.”\nPost Mortem lividity.\nSeated at her Chapter House table, all of those years removed from the event, Taraza was forced to use her carefully focused powers of concentration to dispel that memory, leaving her free to deal with the work spread before her. So many lessons. So fearfully full, her memory. So many lifetimes stored there. It reaffirmed her sense of being alive to see the work in front of her. Things to do. She was needed. Eagerly, Taraza bent to her labors.\nDamn the necessity to train the ghola on Gammu!\nBut this ghola required it. Familiarity with dirt underfoot preceded the required restoration of that original persona.\nIt had been wise to send Burzmali into the Gammu arena. If Miles had really found a hideaway .. . if he were to emerge now, he would need all the help he could get. Once more, she considered whether it was time to play the prescient game. So dangerous! And the Tleilaxu had been alerted that their replacement ghola might be required.\n“Ready him for delivery.”\nHer mind swung to the Rakis problem. That fool Tuek should have been monitored more carefully. How long could a Face Dancer safely impersonate him? There was no faulting Odrade’s on-scene decision, though. She had put the Tleilaxu into an untenable position. The impersonator could be exposed, plunging the Bene Tleilaxu into a sink of hatred.\nThe game within the Bene Gesserit design had become very delicate.

She had put the Tleilaxu into an untenable position. The impersonator could be exposed, plunging the Bene Tleilaxu into a sink of hatred.\nThe game within the Bene Gesserit design had become very delicate. For generations now, they had held out to the Rakian priesthood the bait of a Bene Gesserit alliance. But now! The Tleilaxu must consider that they had been chosen instead of the priests. Odrade’s three-cornered alliance, let the priests think every Reverend Mother would take the Oath of Subservience to the Divided God. The Priestly Council would stutter with excitement at the prospect. The Tleilaxu, of course, saw the chance to monopolize melange, controlling at last the one source independent of them.\nA rap at Taraza’s door told her the acolyte had arrived with tea. It was a standing order when the Mother Superior worked late. Taraza glanced at the table chrono, an Ixian device so accurate it would gain or lose only one second in a century: 1:23:11 a.m.\nShe called to admit the acolyte. The girl, a pale blond with coldly observant eyes, entered and bent to arrange the contents of her tray beside Taraza.\nTaraza ignored the girl and stared at the work remaining on the table. So much to do. Work was more important than sleep. But her head ached and she felt the telltale dazed sensation akin to a stunned brain that told her the tea would provide little relief. She had worked herself into mental starvation and it would have to be put right before she could even stand. Her shoulders and back throbbed.\nThe acolyte started to leave but Taraza motioned for her to wait. “Rub my back please, Sister.”\nThe acolyte’s educated hands slowly worked out the constrictions in Taraza’s back. Good girl. Taraza smiled at this thought. Of course she was good. No lesser creature could be assigned to the Mother Superior.\nWhen the girl had gone, Taraza sat silently in deep thought. So /ittle time. She begrudged every minute of sleep. There was no escaping it, though. Eventually, the body made its unavoidable demands. She had pressed herself beyond easy recuperation for days now. Ignoring the tea laid out beside her, Taraza arose and went down the hall to her tiny sleeping cell. There, she left a call with the Night Guard for 11:00 a.m. and composed herself fully robed on the hard cot.\nQuietly, she regulated her breathing, insulated her senses from distraction and fell into the between-state.\nSleep did not come.\nShe went through her full repertoire and still sleep evaded her.\nTaraza lay there for a long time, recognizing at last the futility of willing herself to sleep with any of the techniques at her disposal. The between-state would have to do its slow mending first. Meanwhile, her mind continued to churn.\nThe Rakian priesthood she had never considered to be a central problem. Already caught up in religion, the priests could be manipulated by religion. They saw the Bene Gesserit chiefly as a power that could enforce their dogma. Let them continue to think this. It was bait that would blind them.\nDamn that Miles Teg! Three months of silence, and no favorable report from Burzmali, either. Charred ground, signs of a no-ship’s lift-off. Where could Teg have gone? The ghola might be dead. Teg had never before done such a thing. Old Reliability. That was why she had chosen him. That and his military skills and his likeness to the old Duke Leto—all of the things they had prepared in him.\nTeg and Lucilla. A perfect team.\nIf not dead, was the ghola beyond their reach? Did the Tleilaxu have him? Attackers from the Scattering? Many things were possible. Old Reliability. Silent. Was his silence a message? If so, what was he trying to say?\nWith both Schwangyu and Patrin dead, there was the smell of conspiracy around the Gammu events. Could Teg be someone planted long ago by the Sisterhood’s enemies? Impossible! His own family was proof against such doubts. Teg’s daughter at the family home was as mystified as anyone.\nThree months now and not a word.\nCaution. She had warned Teg to exercise the utmost caution in protecting the ghola. Teg had seen the great danger on Gammu. Schwangyu’s last reports made that Clear.\nWhere could Teg and Lucilla have taken the ghola?\nWhere had they acquired a no-ship? Conspiracy?\nTaraza’s mind kept circling around her deep suspicions. Was it Odrade’s doing? Then who conspired with Odrade? Lucilla? Odrade and Lucilla had never met before that brief encounter on Gammu. Or had they? Who bent close to Odrade and breathed a mutual air weighted with whispers? Odrade gave no sign, but what proof was that? Lucilla’s loyalty had never been doubted. They both functioned perfectly as assigned. But so would conspirators.\nFacts! Taraza hungered for facts. The bed rustled beneath her and her sense-insulation collapsed, shattered by worries as much as by the sound of her own movements. Resignedly, Taraza once more composed herself for relaxation.\nRelaxation and then sleep.\nShips from the Scattering flitted through Taraza’s fatigue- fogged imagination. Lost Ones returned in their uncounted no-ships. Was that where Teg found a ship? This possibility was being explored as quietly as they could on Gammu and elsewhere. She tried counting imaginary ships but they refused to proceed in the orderly fashion required for sleep induction. Taraza came alert without moving on her cot.\nHer deepest mind was trying to reveal something. Fatigue had blocked that path of communication but now—she sat up fully awake.\nThe Tleilaxu had been dealing with people returned from the Scattering. With these whorish Honored Matres and with returned Bene Tleilax as well. Taraza sensed a single design behind events. The Lost Ones did not return out of simple curiosity about their roots. The gregarious desire to reunite all of humankind was not enough in itself to bring them back. The Honored Matres clearly came with dreams of conquest.\nBut what if the Tleilaxu sent out in the Scattering had not carried with them the secret of the axlotl tanks? What then? Melange. The orange-eyed whores obviously used an inadequate substitute. The people of the Scattering might\nnot have solved the mystery of the Tleilaxu tanks. They would know about axlotl tanks and try to re-create them. But if they failed—melange!\nShe began to explore this projection.\nThe Lost Ones ran out of the true melange their ancestors took into the Scattering. What sources did they have then? The worms of Rakis and the original Bene Tleilax. The whores would not dare reveal their true interest. Their ancestors believed that the worms could not be transplanted. Was it possible the Lost Ones had found a Suitable planet for the worms? Of course it was possible. They might begin bargaining with the Tleilaxu as a diversion. Rakis would be their real target. Or the reverse could be true.\nTransportable wealth.\nShe had seen Teg’s reports on the wealth being accumulated on Gammu. Some among the ones returning had coinages and other negotiable chips. That much was plain from the banking activities.\nWhat greater currency was there, though, than the spice?\nWealth. That was it, of course. And whatever the chips, the bargaining had begun.\nTaraza grew aware of voices outside her door. The acolyte Sleep-Guard was arguing with someone. The voices were low but Taraza heard enough to bring her into full alert.\n“She left a wake-up for late morning,” the Sleep-Guard protested.\nSomeone else whispered: “She said she was to be told the moment | returned.”\n“I tell you she is very tired. She needs—”\n“She needs to be obeyed! Tell her I’m back!”\nTaraza sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the cot. Her feet found the floor. Gods! How her knees ached. It pained her, too, that she could not place the intruding whisper, the person arguing with her guard.\nWhose return did I... Burzmali!\n“I’m awake,” Taraza called.\nHer door opened and the Sleep-Guard leaned in. “Mother Superior, Burzmali has returned from Gammu.”\n“Send him in at once!” Taraza activated a single glowglobe at the head of her cot. Its yellow light washed away the room’s darkness.\nBurzmali entered and closed the door behind him. Without being told, he touched the sound-insulation switch on the door and all outside noises vanished.\nPrivacy? It was bad news then.\nShe looked up at Burzmali. He was a short, slender fellow with a sharply triangular face narrowing to a thin chin. Blond hair swept over a high forehead. His widely spaced green eyes were alert and watchful. He looked far too young for the responsibilities of a Bashar, but then Teg had looked even younger at Arbelough. We are getting old, damn it. She forced herself to relax and place her trust in the fact that Teg had trained this man and expressed full confidence in him.\n“Tell me the bad news,” Taraza said.\nBurzmali cleared his throat. “Still no sign of the Bashar and his party on Gammu, Mother Superior.” He had a heavy, masculine voice.\nAnd that’s not the worst of it, Taraza thought. She saw the clear signs of Burzmali’s nervousness.\n“Let’s have it all,” she ordered. “Obviously, you have completed your examination of the Keep’s ruins.”\n“No survivors,” he said. “The attackers were thorough.”\n“Tleilaxu?”\n“Possible.”\n“You have doubts?”\n“The attackers used that new Ixian explosive, 12-Uri. l... | think it may have been used to mislead us. There were mechanical brain-probe holes in Schwangyu’s skull, too.”\n“What of Patrin?”\n“Exactly as Schwangyu reported. He blew himself up in that decoy ship. They identified him from bits of two fingers and one intact eye. There was nothing left big enough to probe.”\n“But you have doubts! Get to them!”\n“Schwangyu left a message that only we might read.”\n“In the wear marks on furniture?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior, and—”\n“Then she knew she would be attacked and had time to leave a message. | saw your earlier report on the devastation of the attack.”\n“It was quick and totally overpowering. The attackers did not try to take captives.”\n“What did she say?”\n“Whores.”\nTaraza tried to contain her shock, although she had been expecting that word. The effort to remain calm almost drained her energies. This was very bad. Taraza permitted herself a deep sigh.
