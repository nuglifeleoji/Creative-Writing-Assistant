These ruling dynasties, including **House Atreides** and **House Harkonnen**, vie for influence within the **Landsraad**, the imperial assembly where alliances and rivalries shape the fate of the Imperium. Bound by the **Great Convention**, which prohibits the use of atomic weapons like the **stone burner**, the Great Houses engage in intricate power struggles while adhering to the empire's strict codes.  \n\nOnce dominant in wealth and influence, some Great Houses lament their diminished status, particularly those who have lost their **spice riches**, though a few retain small hoards under **Leto's empire**. Their delegates play key roles in political schemes, including **betrothal plots** and strategic marriages, such as those seeking alliance with the **Duke**. The **Emperor** often rallies them against threats like the **Baron**, leveraging their military might—such as the **armada stationed over Arrakis**—to enforce imperial will.  \n\nWhile historically formidable, the Great Houses now face shifting dynamics, with **Houses Minor** rising in influence. Their collective opinions and allegiances remain pivotal, capable of opposing figures like **Paul** or shaping imperial policy. Despite their diminished glory, they remain central to the Imperium's feudal structure, embodying both its enduring traditions and its volatile power struggles.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251740, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 294, "prompt_tokens": 481, "total_tokens": 775, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 417}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
