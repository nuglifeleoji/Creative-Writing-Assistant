�养民心里不知怎样，面子上还和他保持着一般交往的关系。当然，不论是在他面前，还是在众人面前，他现在已经不回避他和郝红梅的相好关系。至于郝红梅，倒似乎专意让别人知道她和顾养民好。她现在上街，就借顾养民的自行车。回来的时候，故意在人多处给顾养民还车子，并且羞羞答答看养民一眼，说：“谢谢……” \n　　谢谢。对于孙少平来说，他也要对生活的教训说一声谢谢。这一件事的前后经历，也许实际上对他并没有坏处。他是失去了一些情感上的温柔，但也获得了许多心灵上的收获。他现在平心静气地想，顾养民是一个好人——他挨了打，但没有报复打他的人。顾养民不会怯火这些人！这些人再残，也残不过学校的王法。只要他告，这些人都不会轻松，而且为首的金波说不定会让学校开除的。他对这件事采取了息事宁人的态度，反而在精神上把他和金波他们镇住了。 \n　　他又进一步想，郝红梅抛开他而和顾养民相好，也完全是正常的啊！他自己在哪方面都无法和顾养民比较。男女相好，这是两厢情愿的事，而怎能象俗话说的“剃头担子一头热”呢？ \n　　青春激流打起的第一个浪头在内心渐渐平伏了。孙少平甚至感到了一种解脱的喜悦。他似乎觉得自己的精神比原来还要充实一些。他现在认识到，他是一个普普通通的人，应该按照普通人的条件正正常常的生活，而不要做太多的非分之想。当然，普通并不等于庸俗。他也许一辈子就是个普通人，但他要做一个不平庸的人。在许许多多平平常常的事情中，应该表现出不平常的看法和做法来。比如，象顾养民这家伙，挨了别人的打，但不报复打他的人——尽管按常情来说，谁挨了打也不会平平静静，但人家的做法就和一般人不一样。这件事就值得他好好思量思量。这期间，少平获得了一个非常重要的认识：在最平常的事情中都可以显示出一个人人格的伟大来！ \n　　这是第一次关于人生的自我教育。这也许会在他以后的生活中发生深远的影响……过了几天，在少平的生活中突然出现一件他想不到的事。学校根据县宣传部和文化局的指示，要组织一个校一级的文艺宣传队，巡回到各公社宣传演出。他们班的金波、顾养民、郝红梅和他，都选拔上了。他被确定参加一幕小戏的演出，还另出一个节目讲故事——《智取威虎山》中打虎上山的一段。顾养民也参加小戏演出，同时还任宣传队副队长。郝红梅是舞蹈队的。金波在乐队吹笛子，并且还有一个独唱节目——他的男高音很出色。 \n　　少平参加演出的这幕小戏叫《夺鞭》，是学校语文组的老师们集体�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>顾养民<|>PERSON<|>顾养民 is a character who has a romantic relationship
