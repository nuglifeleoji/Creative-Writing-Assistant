The room was a darkly important-appearing place with brown wood panels covering instruments which shielded it from spying. There were no windows.\nTrying not to show her upset, Hwi looked up at Yake. “And the Lord Leto is...”\n“The attempt on his life appears to have been totally without effect. But it might explain that flogging.”\n“Then you think there was such an attempt?”\n“Yes.”\nThe Fish Speaker from the Lord Leto entered at that moment, hard on the announcement of her presence in the outer office. She was followed by a Bene Gesserit crone, a person she introduced as “The Reverend Mother Anteac.” Anteac stared intently at Yake while the Fish Speaker, a young woman with smooth, almost childlike features, delivered her message:\n“He told me to remind you: ‘Return quickly if | summon you.’ He summons you.”\nYake began fidgeting as the Fish Speaker spoke. He darted his attention all around the room as though looking for something which was not there. Hwi paused only to pull a dark blue robe over her gown, instructing Yake to remain in the office until she returned.\nIn orange evening light outside the Embassy, on a street oddly empty of other traffic, Anteac looked at the Fish Speaker and said simply: “Yes.” Anteac left them then and the Fish Speaker had brought Hwi through empty streets to a tall, windowless building whose depths contained this down-plunging spiral ramp.\nThe tight curves of the ramp made Hwi dizzy. Brilliant tiny white glowglobes drifted in the central well, illuminating a purple-green vine with elephantine leaves. The vine was Suspended on shimmering golden wires.\nThe soft black surface of the ramp swallowed the sounds of their feet, making Hwi extremely conscious of the faint abrasive swishing caused by the movements of her robe.\n“Where are you taking me?” Hwi asked.\n“To the Lord Leto.”\n“I know, but where is he?”\n“In his private room.”\n“It’s awfully far down.”\n“Yes, the Lord often prefers the depths.”\n“It makes me dizzy walking around and around like this.”\n“It helps if you do not look at the vine.”\n“What is that plant?”\n“It is called a Tunyon Vine and is Supposed to have absolutely no smell.”\n“I’ve never heard of it. Where does it come from?”\n“Only the Lord Leto knows.”\nThey walked on in silence, Hwi trying to understand her own feelings. The God Emperor filled her with sadness. She could sense the man in him, the man who might have been. Why had such a man chosen this course for his life? Did anyone know? Did Moneo know?\nPerhaps Duncan Idaho knew.\nHer thoughts gravitated to Idaho—such a physically attractive man. So intense! She could feel herself drawn to him. If only Leto had the body and appearance of Idaho. Moneo, though—that was another matter. She looked at the back of her Fish Speaker escort.\n“Can you tell me about Moneo?” Hwi asked.\nThe Fish Speaker glanced back over her shoulder, an odd expression in her pale blue eyes—apprehension or some bizarre form of awe.\n“Is something wrong?” Hwi asked.\nThe Fish Speaker returned her attention to the downward Spiral of the ramp.\n“The Lord said you would ask about Moneo,” she said.\n“Then tell me about him.”\n“What is there to say? He is the Lord’s closest confidant.”\n“Closer even than Duncan Idaho?”\n“Oh, yes. Moneo is an Atreides.”\n“Moneo came to me yesterday,” Hwi said. “He said | Should know something about the God Emperor. Moneo said\nthe God Emperor is capable of doing anything, anything at all if it is thought to be instructive.”\n“Many believe this,” the Fish Speaker said.\n“You do not believe it?”\nHwi asked the question as the ramp rounded a final turn and opened into a small anteroom with an arched entrance only a few steps away.\n“The Lord Leto will receive you immediately,” the Fish Speaker said. She turned back up the ramp then without speaking of her own belief.\nHwi stepped through the arch and found herself in a low- ceilinged room. It was much smaller than the audience chamber. The air felt crisp and dry. Pale yellow light came from a concealed source at the upper corners. She allowed her eyes to adjust to the lowered illumination, noting carpets and soft cushions scattered around a low mound of... She put a hand to her mouth as the mound moved, realizing then that it was the Lord Leto on his cart, but the cart lay in a sunken area. She knew immediately why the room provided this feature. It made him less imposing to human guests, less overpowering by his physical elevation. Nothing could be done, however, about his length and the inescapable mass of his body except to keep them in shadows, throwing most of the light onto his face and hands.\n“Come in and sit down,” Leto said. He spoke in a low voice, pleasantly conversational.\nHwi crossed to a red cushion only a few meters in front of Leto’s face and sat on it.\nLeto watched her movements with obvious pleasure. She wore a dark golden gown and her hair was tied back in braids which made her face appear fresh and innocent.\n“I have sent your message to |x,” she said. “And | have told them that you wish to know my age.”\n“Perhaps they will answer,” he said. “Their answer may even be truthful.”\n“| would like to know when I was born, all of the circumstances,” she said, “but | don’t know why this interests you.”\n“Everything about you interests me.”\n“They will not like it that you make me the permanent Ambassador.”\n“Your masters are a curious mixture of punctilio and laxity,” he said. “I do not suffer fools gladly.”\n“You think me a fool, Lord?”\n“Malky was not a fool; neither are you, my dear.”\n“I have not heard from my uncle in years. Sometimes | wonder if he still lives.”\n“Perhaps we will learn that as well. Did Malky ever discuss with you my practice of Taguiyya?”\nShe thought about this a moment, then: “It was called Ketman among the ancient Fremen?”\n“Yes. It is the practice of concealing the identity when revealing it might be harmful.”\n“I recall it now. He told me you wrote pseudonymous histories, some of them quite famous.”\n“That was the occasion when we discussed Taguiyya.”\n“Why do you speak of this, Lord?”\n“To avoid other subjects. Did you know that | wrote the books of Noah Arkwright?”\nShe could not suppress a chuckle. “How amusing, Lord. | was required to read about his //fe.”\n“I wrote that account, too. What secrets were you asked to wrest from me?”\nShe did not even blink at his strategic change of subject.\n“They are curious about the inner workings of the religion of the Lord Leto.”\n“Are they now?”\n“They wish to know how you took religious control away from the Bene Gesserit.”\n“No doubt hoping to repeat my performance for themselves?”\n“I’m sure that’s in their minds, Lord.”\n“Hwi, you are a terrible representative of the Ixians.”\n“lam your servant, Lord.”\n“Have you no curiosities of your own?”\n“| fear that my curiosities might disturb you,” she said. He stared at her a moment, then: “I see. Yes, you are right. We should avoid more intimate conversation for now.\nWould you like me to talk about the Sisterhood?”\n“Yes, that would be good. Do you know that | met one of the Bene Gesserit delegation today?”\n“That would be Anteac.”\n“I found her frightening,” she said.\n“You have nothing to fear from Anteac. She went to your Embassy at my command. Were you aware that you had been invaded by Face Dancers?”\nHwi gasped, then held herself still while a cold sensation filled her breast. “Othwi Yake?” she asked.\n“You suspected?”\n“It’s just that | did not like him, and | had been told that...” She shrugged, then, as realization swept over her: “What has happened to him?”\n“The original? He is dead. That’s the usual Face Dancer practice in such circumstances. My Fish Speakers have explicit orders to leave no Face Dancer alive in your Embassy.”\nHwi remained silent, but tears trickled down her cheeks. This explained the empty streets, Anteac’s enigmatic “Yes.” It explained many things.\n“I will provide Fish Speaker assistance for you until you can make other arrangements,” Leto said. “My Fish Speakers will guard you well.”\nHwi shook the tears from her face. The Inquisitors of Ix would react with rage against Tleilax. Would Ix believe her report? Everyone in her Embassy taken over by Face Dancers! It was difficult to believe.\n“Everyone?” she asked.\n“The Face Dancers had no reason to leave any of your Original people alive. You would have been next.”\nShe shuddered.\n“They delayed,” he said, “because they knew they would have to copy you with a precision to defy my senses. They are not sure about my abilities.”\n“Then Anteac.. .”\n“The Sisterhood and | share an ability to detect Face Dancers. And Anteac... well, she is very good at what she does.”\n“No one trusts the Tleilaxu,” she said. “Why haven’t they been wiped out long ago?”\n“Specialists have their uses as well as their limitations. You surprise me, Hwi. | had not suspected you could be that bloody-minded.”\n“The Tleilaxu . . . they are too cruel to be human. They aren’t human!”\n“| assure you that humans can be just as cruel. | myself have been cruel on occasion.”\n“I know, Lord.”\n“With provocation,” he said. “But the only people | have considered eliminating are the Bene Gesserit.”\nHer shock was too great for words.\n“They are so close to what they should be and yet so far,” he said.\nShe found her voice. “But the Oral History says...”\n“The religion of the Reverend Mothers, yes. Once they designed specific religions for specific societies. They called it engineering. How does that strike you?”\n“Callous.”\n“Indeed. The results fit the mistake. Even after all the grand attempts at ecumenism there were countless gods, minor deities and would-be prophets throughout the Empire.”\n“You changed that, Lord.”\n“Somewhat. But gods die hard, Hwi. My monotheism dominates, but the original pantheon remains; it has gone underground in various disguises.”\n“Lord, | sense in your words...a...” She shook her head.\n“Am | as coldly calculating as the Sisterhood?”\nShe nodded.\n“It was the Fremen who deified my father, the great Muad’Dib. Although he doesn’t really care to be called great.”\n“But were the Fremen...”\n“Were they right? My dearest Hwi, they were sensitive to the uses of power and they were greedy to maintain their ascendancy.”\n“I find this .. . disturbing, Lord.”\n“I can see that. You don’t like the idea that becoming a god could be that simple, as though anyone could do it.”\n“It sounds much too casual, Lord.” Her voice had a remote and testing quality.\n“| assure you that anyone could not do it.”\n“But you imply that you inherited your godhood from.. .”\n“Never suggest that to a Fish Speaker,” he said. “They react violently against heresy\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN DEVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ixian devices are advanced technological tools controlled from
