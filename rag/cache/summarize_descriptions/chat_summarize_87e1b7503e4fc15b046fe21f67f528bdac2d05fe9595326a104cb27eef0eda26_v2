Characterized by its arid environment, the Sareer experiences controlled rainfall along its edges, suggesting a managed or artificial climate system. Additionally, the region plays a functional role in supporting the Citadel by providing cool air through a system of wings, indicating a symbiotic relationship between the two entities. This cooling mechanism implies that the Citadel relies on the Sareer’s natural or engineered features to maintain its environment, while the Sareer’s controlled rainfall hints at advanced environmental regulation.
