These clones are resurrected from deceased individuals, often using cadaver cells, and possess the potential to regain their past memories and abilities. The ghola process is a sophisticated form of genetic resurrection, central to both Tleilaxu schemes and the broader plans of other factions, such as the **Bene Gesserit**.  \n\nA prominent example of a ghola is **Duncan Idaho**, a recurring figure resurrected multiple times through this method. Gholas like him are not mere replicas but are capable of recovering their original identities, making them valuable assets in political and strategic machinations. The Tleilaxu employ this technology for their own agendas, though its applications sometimes intersect with the interests of other powerful groups.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing memory restoration, others focusing on the cloning process—the core definition remains consistent: a ghola is a Tleilaxu-engineered clone of a deceased person, designed with the potential to reclaim their past consciousness. This makes them unique among clones, as they bridge the gap between biological recreation and true resurrection. The ghola process underscores the Tleilaxu's mastery over life, death, and memory, positioning them as key players in the universe's power dynamics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251798, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 239}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
