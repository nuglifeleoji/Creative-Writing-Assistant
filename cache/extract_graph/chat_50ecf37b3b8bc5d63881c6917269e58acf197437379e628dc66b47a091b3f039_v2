The veil bulged with the outline of a stillsuit’s catchtube. This told Alia that they’d come in from the desert. Where did they hide out there?\nThe Preacher wore no veil protection from the searing air. He had even dropped the catchtube flap of his stillsuit. His face lay open to the sunlight and the heat shiverings which lifted off the square’s paving blocks in visible waves.\nAt the Temple steps there stood a group of nine pilgrims making their departure obeisance. The shadowed edge of the square held perhaps fifty more persons, mostly pilgrims devoting themselves to various penances imposed by the priesthood. Among the onlookers could be seen messengers and a few merchants who’d not yet made enough sales to close up for the worst of the day’s heat.\nx x x\nVA aching from the open slit, Alia felt the drenching heat and knew herself to be caught between thinking and sensation, the way she’d often seen her brother caught. The\ntemptation to consult within herself rang like an ominous humming in her head. The Baron was there: dutiful, but always ready to play upon her terrors when rational judgment failed and the things around her lost their sense of past, present, and future.\nWhat if that’s Paul down there? she asked herself.\n“Nonsense!” the voice within her said.\nBut the reports of The Preacher’s words could not be doubted. Heresy! It terrified her to think that Paul himself might bring down the structure built on his name.\nWhy not?\nShe thought of what she’d said in Council just that morning, turning viciously upon Irulan, who’d urged acceptance of the gift of clothing from House Corrino.\n“All gifts to the twins will be examined thoroughly, just as always,” Irulan had argued.\n“And when we find the gift harmless?” Alia had cried.\nSomehow that had been the most frightening thing of all: to find that the gift carried no threat.\nIn the end they’d accepted the fine clothing and had gone on to the other issue: Was the Lady Jessica to be given a position on the Council? Alia had managed to delay a vote.\nShe thought of this as she stared down at The Preacher.\nThings which happened to her Regency now were like the underside of that transformation they inflicted upon this planet. Dune had once symbolized the power of ultimate desert. That power dwindled physically, but the myth of its power grew apace. Only the ocean-desert remained, the great Mother Desert of the inner planet, with its rim of thorn bushes, which Fremen still called Queen of Night. Behind the thorn bushes arose soft green hills bending down to the sand. All the hills were man-made. Every last one of them had been planted by men who had labored like crawling insects. The green of those hills was almost overpowering to someone raised, as Alia had been, in the tradition of dun- shaded sand. In her mind, as in the minds of all Fremen, the\nocean-desert still held Dune in a grip which would never relax. She had only to close her eyes and she would see that desert.\nOpen eyes at the desert edge saw now the verdant hills, marsh slime reaching out green pseudopods toward the sand—but the other desert remained as powerful as ever.\nAlia shook her head, stared down at The Preacher.\nHe had mounted the first of the terraced steps below the Temple and turned to face the almost deserted square. Alia touched the button beside her window which would amplify voices from below. She felt a wave of self-pity, seeing herself held here in loneliness. Whom could she trust? She’d thought Stilgar remained reliable, but Stilgar had been infected by this blind man.\n“You know how he counts?” Stilgar had asked her. “l heard him counting coins as he paid his guide. It’s very strange to my Fremen ears, and that’s a terrible thing. He counts ’shuc, ishcai, gimsa, chuascu, picha, sucta, and so on. I’ve not heard counting like that since the old days in the desert.”\nFrom this, Alia knew that Stilgar could not be sent to do the job which must be done. And she would have to be circumspect with her guards where the slightest emphasis from the Regency tended to be taken as absolute command.\nWhat was he doing down there, this Preacher?\nThe surrounding marketplace beneath its protective balconies and arched arcade still presented a gaudy face: merchandise left on display with a few boys to watch over it. Some few merchants remained awake there sniffing for the spice-biscuit money of the back country or the jingle in a pilgrim’s purse.\nAlia studied The Preacher’s back. He appeared poised for speech, but something withheld his voice.\nWhy do I stand here watching that ruin in ancient flesh? she asked herself. That mortal wreckage down there cannot be the “vessel of magnificence” which once was my brother.\nFrustration bordering on anger filled her. How could she find out about The Preacher, find out for certain without finding out? She was trapped. She dared not reveal more than a passing curiosity about this heretic.\nlrulan felt it. She’d lost her famous Bene Gesserit poise and screamed in Council: “We've lost the power to think well of ourselves!”\nEven Stilgar had been shocked.\nJavid had brought them back to their senses: “We don’t have time for such nonsense!”\nJavid was right. What did it matter how they thought of themselves? All that concerned them was holding onto the Imperial power.\nBut Irulan, recovering her poise, had been even more devastating: “We’ve lost something vital, | tell you. When we lost it, we lost the ability to make good decisions. We fall upon decisions these days the way we fall upon an enemy— or wait and wait, which is a form of giving up, and we allow the decisions of others to move us. Have we forgotten that we were the ones who set this current flowing?”\nAnd all over the question of whether to accept a gift from House Corrino.\nlrulan will have to be disposed of, Alia decided.\nWhat was that old man down there waiting for? He called himself a preacher. Why didn’t he preach?\nlrulan was wrong about our decision-making, Alia told herself. / can still make proper decisions! The person with life-and-death decisions to make must make decisions or remain caught in the pendulum. Paul had always said that stasis was the most dangerous of those things which were not natural. The only permanence was fluid. Change was all that mattered.\nlIl show them change! Alia thought.\nThe Preacher raised his arms in benediction.\nA few of those remaining in the square moved closer to him, and Alia noted the slowness of that movement. Yes, the\nrumors were out that The Preacher had aroused Alia’s displeasure. She bent closer to the Ixian speaker beside her spy hole. The speaker brought her the murmurings of the people in the square, the sound of wind, the scratching of feet on sand.\n“I bring you four messages!” The Preacher said.\nHis voice blared from Alia’s speaker, and she turned down the volume.\n“Each message is for a certain person,” The Preacher said. “The first message is for Alia, the suzerain of this place.” He pointed behind him toward her spy hole. “I bring her a warning: You, who held the secret of duration in your loins, have sold your future for an empty purse!”\nHow dare he? Alia thought. But his words froze her.\n“My second message,” The Preacher said, “is for Stilgar, the Fremen Naib, who believes he can translate the power of the tribes into the power of the Imperium. My warning to you, Stilgar: The most dangerous of all creations is a rigid code of ethics. It will turn upon you and drive you into exile!”\nHe has gone too far! Alia thought. / must send the guards for him no matter the consequences. But her hands remained at her sides.\nThe Preacher turned to face the Temple, climbed to the second step and once more whirled to face the square, all the time keeping his left hand upon the shoulder of his guide. He called out now: “My third message is for the Princess Irulan. Princess! Humiliation is a thing which no person can forget. | warn you to flee!”\nWhat’s he saying? Alia asked herself. We humiliated Irulan, but... Why does he warn her to flee? My decision was just made! A thrill of fear shot through Alia. How did The Preacher know?\n“My fourth message is for Duncan Idaho,” he shouted. “Duncan! You were taught to believe that loyalty buys loyalty. Ohh, Duncan, do not believe in history, because\nhistory is impelled by whatever passes for money. Duncan! Take your horns and do what you know best how to do.”\nAlia chewed the back of her right hand. Horns! She wanted to reach out and press the button which would Summon guards, but her hand refused to move.\n“Now | will preach to you,” The Preacher said. “This is a sermon of the desert. | direct it to the ears of Muad’Dib’s priesthood, those who practice the ecumenism of the sword. Ohhh, you believers in manifest destiny! Know you not that manifest destiny has its demoniac side? You cry out that you find yourselves exalted merely to have lived in the blessed generations of Muad’Dib. | say to you that you have abandoned Muad’Dib. Holiness has replaced love in your religion! You court the vengeance of the desert!”\nThe Preacher lowered his head as though in prayer.\nAlia felt herself shivering with awareness. Gods below! That voice! It had been cracked by years in the burning sands, but it could be the remnant of Paul’s voice.\nOnce more The Preacher raised his head. His voice boomed out over the square where more people had begun to gather, attracted by this oddity out of the past.\n“Thus it is written!” The Preacher shouted. “They who pray for dew at the desert’s edge shall bring forth the deluge! They shall not escape their fate through powers of reason! Reason arises from pride that a man may not know in this way when he has done evil.” He lowered his voice. “It was said of Muad’Dib that he died of prescience, that knowledge of the future killed him and he passed from the universe of reality into the alam al-mythal. | say to you that this is the illusion of Maya. Such thoughts have no independent reality. They cannot go out from you and do real things. Muad’Dib said of himself that he possessed no Rihani magic with which to encipher the universe. Do not doubt him.”\nAgain The Preacher raised his arms, lifted his voice in a stentorian bellow: “I warn the priesthood of Muad’Dib! The\nfire on the cliff shall burn you! They who learn the lesson of self-deception too well shall perish by that deception. The blood of a brother cannot be cleansed away!”\nHe had lowered his arms, found his young guide, and was leaving the square before Alia could break herself from the trembling immobility which had overcome her. Such fearless heresy! It must be Paul. She had to warn her guards. They dared not move against this Preacher openly. The evidence in the square below her confirmed this.\nDespite the heresy, no one moved\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_50ecf37b3b8bc5d63881c6917269e58acf197437379e628dc66b47a091b3f039_v2"}
