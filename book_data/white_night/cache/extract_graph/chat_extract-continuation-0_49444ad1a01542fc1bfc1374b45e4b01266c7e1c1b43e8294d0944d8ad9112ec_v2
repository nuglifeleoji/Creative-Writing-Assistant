与此同时，蓝轩宇突然停步大喝，“等一下。”\n\n    已经在后面快速跟上的梁铮三人，闻言一愣。略微放缓了步伐。\n\n    “这一场，我们认输了。”蓝轩宇毫不犹豫的说道。\n\n    认输？\n\n    梁铮脸色一松，停下脚步，向蓝轩宇点了点头。\n\n    是的，这一场实在是太被动了。钱磊是没办法继续召唤的，而对方拥有远程攻击手段，这必然会牵制的蓝轩宇要守护在钱磊身边。\n\n    而对手有控制、有远程、有强攻。他和刘锋配合再默契，二对三，获胜概率也不大。再加上先前已经赢了四场，根本就没有硬拼的必要。所以，蓝轩宇毫不犹豫的选择了认输。\n\n    审时度势，梁铮这一组本身也是班里最强的几组之一，几乎是仅次于吕千寻小队的实力。在他们手中认输，以节省自身精力无疑是比较好的选择。不然的话，硬拼之下先不说胜负，消耗一定是巨大的。精力和精神力的消耗，是每场战斗结束之后不那么容易恢复过来的。\n\n    外面观战的老师们看到蓝轩宇他们主动认输了一场，反而有种松了口气的感觉。\n\n    要是让他们这奇葩的组合一直赢下去才是问题呢，必然会对高能少年班其他学员产生极大的打击。\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百二十二章 压迫一下试试\n\n    “还有几组到吕千寻他们上场？”银天凡向牧重天问道。牧重天道：“还有一组就到吕千寻他们了。”\n\n    银天凡眼中光芒一闪，道：“提前一组，现在就让吕千寻他们上。然后告诉蓝轩宇这组，如果输给吕千寻他们，就算后面的都输了。”\n\n    “啊？副院长，这样不妥吧？这是违背规则的啊！恐怕他们会不服气。”牧重天惊讶地看着面前这位。\n\n    他一直知道这位一向不按常理出牌，可是，如果贸然改变已经制定好的规则，对学生而言，实在是太不公平了，学院的公信力何在?\n\n    银天凡淡定地道：“没关系，按我说的做。不压迫一下，怎能让他们拿出真本事?在有余力的情况下选择放弃，他们显然是觉得前面已经赢了四场了，怎么都能坚持到钱磊再召唤一次。\n\n    既然是考核，当然要让他们将所有的能力都展示出来，看看这些小家伙的极限在哪里。按我的话去做，如果蓝轩宇他们不服气，我会解决。”\n\n    牧重天看向季洪彬，只有季老师在这位副院长面前说话才管用。牧重天却没想到，季洪彬竟然也点了点头，道：“按照副院长说的办，不能给这些小家伙‘偷奸耍滑’的机会。不压迫一下，对后面考核的小组就不公平了。”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
