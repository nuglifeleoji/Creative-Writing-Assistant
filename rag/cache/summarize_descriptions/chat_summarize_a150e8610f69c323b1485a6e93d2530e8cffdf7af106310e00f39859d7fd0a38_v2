Though it is described as no longer existing in later accounts, its legacy endures as a pivotal site in Fremen history. Wind Pass was home to a Fremen sietch where the planetologist Liet-Kynes successfully persuaded the Fremen to embrace his ecological vision for transforming Arrakis. Strategically important, the pass was situated near the Cave of Birds and functioned as a gateway to a protected village, making it a key defensive sector for the Fremen.
