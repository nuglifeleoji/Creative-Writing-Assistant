Initially introduced as a skilled survivalist adept in evasion, Tormsa led Duncan to a shelter and planned to rendezvous with a no-ship, suggesting a role as a trusted ally in navigating the planet's dangers. However, Tormsa's identity is shrouded in mystery, with speculation that they may be an alternate identity of **Ambitorm**, possibly a **Face Dancer**—a shapeshifting entity from the *Dune* universe.  \n\nTormsa's fate is marked by tragedy, as they died during the journey with Duncan, an event that ultimately contributed to Duncan's subsequent captivity.
