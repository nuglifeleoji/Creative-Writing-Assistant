蓝轩宇下了车，和蓝潇说了再见后就迫不及待的走进了校门。\n\n    一年级二班班主任秋雨馨在班级门口等着，每天早上她都会等在这里，数着自己的学生一个个进班。\n\n    远远的她就看到蓝轩宇了，着实是因为这孩子的外表太过出众，想不注意都不行。\n\n    “秋老师早上好。”蓝轩宇来到近前，恭敬而标准的向秋雨馨鞠躬行礼。\n\n    秋雨馨微笑道：“轩宇早上好。咦，一个假期不见，你好像长高了哦。”\n\n    “是吗？谢谢老师。”蓝轩宇笑眯眯的道。\n\n    “快进去吧。”秋雨馨忍不住摸摸他的头。这孩子长得好、学习又好，没有老师会不喜欢的。\n\n    尤其是上学期末，他还赢了被誉为这一届学生中最有天赋的叶灵瞳，着实是给她涨了面子，秋雨馨对他自然是越发的喜爱了。\n\n    “蓝轩宇！”正在这时，熟悉的声音响起。\n\n    蓝轩宇转身看去，只见隔壁班，也就是一年级一班的门口，班长叶灵瞳探出头来，向他招了招手。\n\n    “干嘛？”蓝轩宇有些不情不愿的问道。\n\n    叶灵瞳道：“你过来，我跟你说个事儿。”\n------------\n\n第四十三章 近战蓝轩宇\n\n    “不去，我要上课了。”蓝轩宇不等叶灵瞳再说话，已经“嗖”的一下冲进了自己班里。\n\n    叶灵瞳气的柳眉倒竖，“蓝轩宇，你给我等着。哼！”\n\n    秋雨馨也不斥责，只是觉得好玩儿，忍不住笑了起来。\n\n    蓝轩宇是二班最优秀的，那叶灵瞳就是一班的翘楚。但这俩就是不对付，叶灵瞳总是想要在各方面超越蓝轩宇，可却始终都没能成功。\n\n    老师们是喜欢看到这种竞争的，有竞争成长的会更快。魂师学院在这方面是放的最开的。\n\n    上课铃响起第二次的时候，新学期的上课就开始了。\n\n    因为是一年级第二学期，连开学典礼什么的都没有，直接进入课程。\n\n    一年级二班的第一堂课就是正班主任秋雨馨自己的。\n\n    “经过了一个假期，估计你们在家也都懒得可以。待会儿我们先进行一下测试，测试魂力和精神力数据。这是最能体现你们在假期有没有偷懒的。然后今天下午，大课，实战课。我们和一年级一班的整体对抗。赢了有奖励，输了嘛……”秋老师不怀好意的笑了笑。\n\n    蓝轩宇突然觉得背脊有些发凉，和一年级一班的实战课？他突然有点后悔，刚才不应该拒绝叶灵瞳的那么干脆了。\n\n    不过，想想自己这假期和娜娜老师学习的进步，倒是也不怕她。\n\n    “呦，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a student in the second class of the
