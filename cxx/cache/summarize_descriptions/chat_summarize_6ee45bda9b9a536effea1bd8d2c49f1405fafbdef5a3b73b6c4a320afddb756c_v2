It is referenced as the starting point of a communication line, facilitating exchanges with other locations. In the context of a crisis, such as power outages, children in Beijing are depicted as seeking help and information, calling for their parents amidst the turmoil. \n\nThe city is also noted for being the site of significant events, including a fire, which further emphasizes its role as a focal point during emergencies.
