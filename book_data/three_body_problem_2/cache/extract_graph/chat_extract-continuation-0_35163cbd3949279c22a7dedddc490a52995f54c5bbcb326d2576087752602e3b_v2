个巨大的鼓舞，也在很大程度上缓解了失败主义情绪。但冷静的领导者们知道，这一切仅仅是开始，如果把太空舰队的建设与海洋舰队相类比的话，人类现在也只是拿着工具刚刚来到海岸边，连造船的船坞都还没有搭建起来。除了太空飞船本体的建设，星战武器和飞船循环生态系统的研究，以及太空港口的建设。都将面临着人类从未面对过的技术深渊，这一切，仅在技术上完成准备，可能就需要一个世纪的时间。除令人望而生畏的技术深渊外，人类社会还将面临另一个严峻的考验：太空防御系统的建设将消耗超量的资源，这种消耗很可能使人类的生活水平倒退一个世纪。\n　　所以，对人类精神的最大挑战还在未来。正是在这种情况下，上级决定开始实施太空军政工干部增援未来计划，章北海作为计划的最初提出者，被选定为第一批增援未来特遣队的指挥官。他在接到任命后提出，在进入冬眠前，应该让所有特遭队军官至少在太空中实习和工怍一年时间。这是对他们未来在太空军中的工作必需的准备。“上级不希望我们在那时成为不能出海的舰队政委吧？”他这样对常伟思说。这个请示很快得到了批准，一个月后，他将和第一支特遣队的三十名同志进入太空。\n　　“您是军人吧。”收藏者端茶时间道。得到对方肯定的点头后，他说，“现在的军人已经不太像军人了，但您我一眼就能看出来。”\n　　“您也曾经是军人。”章北海说。\n　　“好眼力，我大半辈子都是在总参测绘局服役。”\n　　“怎么会对陨石感兴趣呢？”章北海赞赏地打量着这丰富的收藏问道。\n　　“十多年前，我随考察队穿越南极大陆，任务就是负责在雪下面找陨石，以后就迷上了这东西。它们来自尘世之外，遥远的太空，当然是很有魅力了，我每拿到一块陨石，就像去了一个新的外星世界一样。”\n　　章北海笑着摇摇头，“这只是您的感觉而已，地球就是由星际物质汇聚形成的，所以地球就是一块大陨石，我们脚下的石头都是陨石，我手里的茶杯也是陨石。而且，据说地球上的水是由彗星带来的，所以……”他说着举举茶杯，“这茶杯里面盛的也是陨石，您这些东西应该是不稀罕的。”\n　　收藏者指点着章北海笑了起来：“呵呵呵，你很精明，已经开始砍价了……不过我还是相信自个儿的感觉。”\n　　收藏者说着，迫不及待地拉章北海欣赏自己的藏品，他甚至打开保险柜展示自己的镇宅之宝：一块来自火星的无球粒陨石，指甲大小。他让章北海在显微镜下观看陨石表面那些小圆坑，说它们有可能是微生物的化石。\n　　“五年前，黑格（1）想以黄金价格的一�\n######################\nOutput:",
