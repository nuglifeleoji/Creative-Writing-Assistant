�果在枝头如羞涩的少女露出红艳艳的笑脸。有些性急的雁群，此时已经从鄂尔多斯茫茫的草地里飞来，嗷嗷地掠过清净如水的天空，到南方寻找温暖去了……这样的大好时光常常使人不由生出许多莫名的激动来。 \n　　孙少平上井以后，如果是白天，他总会迫不急待地走出矿区，走向如火如霞的山野之中。 \n　　他面对满山红叶，回首往事，默想未来。或驻足停立林间小路；或踽踽漫步于溪流河畔。折一枝红叶在手，听万顷松涛澎湃，欢欣与忧伤共生。在这一片无声的热烈之中，人既想流泪又想唱歌……这样的时候，他就忘记了他是刚从喧嚣激烈如同战场一般的井下上来的。 \n　　噢，他现在看起来不象个煤矿工人，倒象个多愁善感的诗人！ \n　　难道只有会写诗的人才产生诗情吗？其实，所有人的情感中都具备诗情——而普通人在生活中的诗情是往往不会被职业诗人们所理解的。 \n　　不必指责一个煤矿工人会产生如此的情调，尽管他们干又脏又累的活，看起来粗粗笨笨，有时候还说脏话，但在他们中间，又有多少外人所不了解的丰富的内心世界和细腻的心理情感呢？ \n　　孙少平在这红叶如火的山野里想了些什么？ \n　　他也说不清楚——这也正如诗人们通常所具有的那种情况。 \n　　不过，每当他从大自然的怀抱里返回来的时候，就象进行了一次沐浴似的爽快。这是精神的沐浴。 \n　　他的心情因此而格外地好。 \n　　最近，生活中还有些值得高兴的事。他已经被命名为铜城矿务局的“青年突击手”，过几天就去出席表彰大会。他不全是为荣誉高兴，而是感到，他的劳动和汗水得到了承认和尊重。他看重的是劳动者的尊严和自豪感。在这个世界上，只有人的劳动和创造才是最值得骄傲的。 \n　　另外，他最近分别接到了父亲和哥哥的来信，说他梦寐以求的新窑洞已经修建好了。哥哥还在信中详细描绘了这院子的“气派”和双水村人的“反应”。 \n　　他激动得一次又一次想象那地方。只有象他一样从贫困农村走出来的青年，才能深刻体会到这件事的激动；那地方的荣辱历史永远牵着他的心肠！ \n　　现在，老人们终于住进了新窑洞，这了却了他此生最大一桩心愿。 \n　　少平也从家里的来信知道，哥哥已经承包了石圪节乡的砖瓦厂，事业正到了红火处；而嫂子违反目前计划生育政策，又生了个小侄女，取名为燕子……妹妹兰香也来信了，说她和那个叫吴仲平的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
