Their union is deeply tied to the political dynamics surrounding Paul's legacy, particularly his rise to power and the broader struggles for control within the empire. While the descriptions emphasize her role as his wife, they also clarify that their relationship lacks personal intimacy, underscoring its strategic importance in the political landscape.  \n\nPaul Atreides, as the central figure in this dynamic, is connected to Princess Irulan through this formal alliance, which serves to consolidate his authority and influence.
