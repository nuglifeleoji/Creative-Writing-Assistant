She actively negotiates with Tuek, seeking to influence his decisions to align with her objectives. Their relationship is marked by power dynamics, as Odrade not only observes Tuek’s actions but also makes critical decisions regarding his fate, including matters involving his impersonation by a Face Dancer on Rakis.  \n\nOdrade reflects on Tuek’s failures and legacy, suggesting a complex assessment of his role and impact. Her observations are not merely retrospective; she leverages Tuek’s death to her advantage, using the event as a strategic tool in further negotiations. This indicates her ability to turn even the most dire circumstances into opportunities for advancement.  \n\nThrough these interactions, Odrade emerges as a dominant figure, manipulating events around Tuek—whether in life or death—to serve her broader goals. Tuek, in contrast, is portrayed as a figure whose influence wanes, ultimately becoming a pawn in Odrade’s schemes.
