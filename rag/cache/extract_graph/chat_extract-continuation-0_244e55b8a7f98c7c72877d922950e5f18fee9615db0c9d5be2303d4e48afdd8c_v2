Perhaps they did. Odrade heard the movement of fabrics and this dragged her out of her\nnightmare. She had become sensitized to a new note in the sounds of Central. There was a grating noise behind the most commonplace movements—that chair being shifted behind her... and the opening of that kitchen door. Rasping grit. Cleaning crews complained of sand and “the damnable dust.”\nOdrade stared out the window at the source of that irritation: wind from the south. A dull haze, something between tan and earth brown, drew a curtain across the horizon. After the wind, dustings of its deposits would be found in building corners and on lee sides of hills. There was a flinty aroma to it, something alkaline that irritated the nostrils.\nShe looked down at the table as a serving acolyte placed her meal in front of her.\nOdrade found herself enjoying this change from quick meals in her workroom and private dining room. When she ate alone up there, acolytes brought food so quietly and cleared away with such silent efficiency that sometimes she was surprised to find everything gone. Here, dining was bustle and conversation. In her quarters, Chef Duana might come in clucking, “You are not eating enough.” Odrade generally heeded such admonitions. Watchdogs had their uses.\nTonight’s meal was sligpork in a sauce of soy and molasses, minimal melange, a touch of basil and lemon. Fresh green beans cooked al dente with peppers. Dark red grape juice to drink. She took a bite of sligpork with anticipation and found it passable, a bit overcooked for her taste. Acolyte chefs had not missed it by much.\nThen why this feeling of too many such meals?\nShe swallowed and hypersensitivity identified additives. This food was not here just to replenish Mother Superior’s energy. Someone in the kitchen had asked for her day’s nutrition list and adjusted this plate accordingly.\nFood is a trap, she thought. More addictions. She did not like the cunning ways Chapterhouse chefs concealed things they put in the food “for the good of the diners.” They knew, of course, that a Reverend Mother could identify ingredients and adjust metabolism within her limits. They were watching her right now, wondering how Mother Superior would judge tonight’s menu.\nAs she ate, she listened to the other diners. None intruded on her—not physically or vocally. Sounds returned almost to what they had been before her entrance. Waggling tongues always changed their tone slightly when she entered and resumed at lower volume.\nAn unspoken question lay in all of those busy minds around her: Why is she here tonight?\nOdrade sensed quiet awe in some nearby diners, a reaction Mother Superior sometimes employed to her advantage. Awe with an edge on it. Acolytes whispered among themselves (so the Proctors reported), “She has Taraza.” They meant Odrade possessed her late predecessor as Primary. The two of them were a historical pair, required study for postulants.\nDar and Tar, already a legend.\nEven Bellonda (dear old vicious Bell) came at Odrade obliquely because of this. Few frontal attacks, very little blaring in her accusatory arguments. Taraza was credited with saving the Sisterhood. That silenced much opposition. Taraza had said Honored Matres were essentially barbarians and their violence, although not totally deflectable, could be guided into bloody displays. Events had more or less verified this.\nCorrect up to a point, Tar. None of us anticipated the extent of their violence.\nTaraza’s classical veronica (how apt the bullring image) had aimed the Honored Matres into such episodes of carnage that the universe was mordant with potential Supporters of their brutalized victims.\nHow do I defend us?\nIt was not so much that defensive plans were inadequate. They could become irrelevant.\nThat, of course, is what I seek. We must be purified and made ready for a supreme effort.\nBellonda had sneered at that idea. “For our demise? Is that why we must be purified?”\nBellonda would be ambivalent when she discovered what Mother Superior planned. Bellonda-vicious would applaud. Bellonda-Mentat would argue for delay “until a more propitious moment.”\nBut | will seek my own peculiar way despite what my Sisters think.\nAnd many Sisters thought Odrade quite the strangest Mother Superior they had ever accepted. Elevated more with the left hand than with the right. Taraza Primary. | was there when you died, Tar. No one else to gather your persona. Elevation by accident?\nMany disapproved of Odrade. But when opposition arose, back they went to “Taraza Primary—the best Mother Superior in our history.”\nAmusing! Taraza Within was the quickest to laugh and ask: Why don’t you tell them about my mistakes, Dar? Especially about how | misjudged you.\nOdrade chewed reflectively on a bite of sligpork. /’m overdue for a visit to Sheeana. South into the desert and that soon. Sheeana must be made ready to replace Tam.\nThe changing landscape loomed large in Odrade’s thoughts. More than fifteen hundred years of Bene Gesserit occupancy on Chapterhouse. Signs of us everywhere. Not just in special groves or vineyards and orchards. What it must be doing to the collective psyche, seeing such changes come over their familiar land.\nThe acolyte seated beside Odrade made a soft throat- clearing sound. Was she about to address Mother Superior?\nA rare occurrence. The young woman continued to eat without speaking.\nOdrade’s thoughts returned to the prospective journey into the desert. Sheeana must have no forewarning. / must be sure she is the one we need. There were questions for Sheeana to answer.\nOdrade knew what she would find on inspection stops en route. In Sisters, in plant and animal life, in the very foundations of Chapterhouse, she would see changes gross and changes subtle, things to wrench at Mother Superior’s vaunted serenity. Even Murbella, never out of the no-ship, sensed these changes.\nOnly that morning, seated with her back to her console, Murbella had listened with new attentiveness to Odrade standing over her. Edgy alertness in the captive Honored Matre. Her voice betrayed doubts and unbalanced judgments.\n“Allis transient, Mother Superior?”\n“That is knowledge impressed on you by Other Memory. No planet, no land or sea, no part of any land or sea is here forever.”\n“A morbid thought!” Rejection.\n“Wherever we stand, we are only stewards.”\n“A useless viewpoint.” Hesitant, questioning why Mother Superior chose this moment to say such things.\n“| hear Honored Matres talking through you. They gave you greedy dreams, Murbella.”\n“So you say!” Deeply resentful.\n“Honored Matres think they can buy infinite security: a Small planet, you know, with plenty of subservient population.”\nMurbella produced a grimace.\n“More planets!” Odrade snapped. “Always more and more and more! That’s why they come swarming back.”\n“Poor pickings in this Old Empire.”\n“Excellent, Murbella! You’re beginning to think like one of\nus.”\n“And that makes me a nothing!”\n“Neither fish nor fowl, but your own true self? Even there, you're only a steward. Beware, Murbella! If you think you own something, that’s like walking on quicksand.”\nThis got a puzzled frown. Something would have to be done about the way Murbella allowed her emotions to play SO openly on her face. It was permissible here, but someday...\n“So nothing is safely owned. So what!” Bitter, bitter.\n“You speak some of the right words but | don’t think you've yet found a place in yourself where you can endure for your lifetime.”\n“Until an enemy finds me and slaughters me?”\nHonored Matre training clings like glue! But she spoke to Duncan the other night in a way that tells me she is ready. The Van Gogh painting, | do believe, has sensitized her. | heard it in her voice. | must review that record.\n“Who would slaughter you, Murbella?”\n“You'll never withstand an Honored Matre attack!”\n“I’ve already stated the basic fact that concerns us: No place is eternally safe.”\n“Another of your useless damned lessons!”\nIn the Acolyte Hall, Odrade recalled she had not found time to review that comeye record of Duncan and Murbella. A sigh almost escaped her. She covered it with a cough. Never do to let the young women see disturbance in Mother Superior.\nTo the desert and Sheeana! Inspection tour as soon as | can make time for it. Time!\nAgain, the acolyte seated beside Odrade made that throat noise. Odrade watched peripherally—blond, short black dress trimmed in white—Intermediate Third Stage. No movement of the head toward Odrade, no sidelong glances.\nThis is what I will find on my inspection tour: Fears. And in the landscape, those things we always see when we run out of time: trees left uncut because woodcutters have gone— dragooned into our Scattering, gone to their graves, gone to unknown places, perhaps even to peonage. Will | see architectural Fancies becoming attractive because they are incomplete, builders departed? No. We don’t go in much for Fancies.\nOther Memory held examples she wished she might find: old buildings more beautiful because they were unfinished. The builder bankrupt, an owner angered at his mistress... Some things were more interesting because of that: old walls, old ruins. Time sculpture.\nWhat would Bell say if | ordered a Fancy in my favorite orchard?\nThe acolyte beside Odrade said: “Mother Superior?”\nExcellent! They so seldom find the courage.\n“Yes?” Faint questioning. This had better be important. Would she hear?\nShe heard. “I intrude, Mother Superior, because of the urgency and because | know your interest in the orchards.”\nSuperb! This acolyte had thick legs but that did not extend to her mind. Odrade stared at her silently.\n“lam the one making the map for your bedchamber, Mother Superior.”\nSo this was a reliable adept, a person trusted with work for Mother Superior. Even better.\n“Will | have my map soon?”\n“Two days, Mother Superior. | am adjusting projection overlays where | will mark the desert’s daily growth.”\nA brief nod. That had been in the original order: an acolyte to keep the map current. Odrade wanted to awaken each morning, her imagination ignited by that changing view, the first thing impressed on awareness at arising.\n“| put a report in your workroom this morning, Mother Superior. ‘Orchard Management.’ Perhaps you did not see\nit.”\nOdrade had seen only the label. She had been late coming from exercises, anxious to visit Murbella. So much depended on Murbella!\n“The plantations around Central must either be abandoned or action taken to sustain them,” the acolyte said. “That’s the gist of the report.”\n“Repeat the report verbatim.”\nNight fell and the room lights brightened as Odrade listened. Concise. Terse even. The report carried a note of admonishment Odrade recognized as originating with Bellonda. No Archival signature but Weather’s warnings went through Archives and this acolyte had lifted some of the original words.\nThe acolyte fell silent, report concluded.\nHow do I respond? Orchards, pastures and vineyards were not merely a buffer against alien intrusions, pleasant decorations on the landscape.
