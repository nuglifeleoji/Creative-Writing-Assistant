Did the Bene Gesserit think their design inscrutable? Let her meet a greater power. She thought herself so strong! But the Bene Gesserit could not really know how the Almighty guarded the future of the Shariat!\nTuek was not to be stopped. “It assaults everything we hold sacred! And it’s being spread everywhere!”\n“By the Tleilaxu,” Odrade said.\nWaff lifted his sleeves, directing his weapons at Tuek. He hesitated only because he saw that Odrade had recognized part of his intentions.\nTuek stared from one to the other. Was Odrade’s accusation true? Or was that just another Bene Gesserit trick?\nOdrade saw Waff’s hesitation and guessed its reason. She cast through her mind, seeking an answer to his motivations. What advantage could the Tleilaxu gain by killing Tuek? Obviously, Waff aimed to substitute one of his Face Dancers for the High Priest. But what would that gain him?\nSparring for time, Odrade said: “You should be very cautious, Ambassador Waff.”\n“When has caution ever governed great necessities?” Waff asked.\nTuek lifted himself to his feet and moved heavily to one side, wringing his hands. “Please! These are holy precincts. It is wrong to discuss heresies here unless we plan to destroy them.” He looked down on Waff. “It’s not true, is it? You are not the authors of that terrible document?”\n“It is not ours,” Waff agreed. Damn that fop of a priest! Tuek had moved well to one side and once more presented a moving target.\n“I knew it!” Tuek said, striding around behind Waff and Odrade.\nOdrade kept her gaze on Waff. He planned murder! She was sure of it.\nTuek spoke from behind her. “You do not know how you wrong us, Reverend Mother. Ser Waff has asked that we form a melange cartel. | explained that our price to you must remain unchanged because one of you was the grandmother of God.”\nWaff bowed his head, waiting. The priest would come back into range. God would not permit a failure.\nTuek stood behind Odrade looking down at Waff. A shudder passed through the priest. Tleilaxu were so...SO repellent and amoral. They could not be trusted. How could Waff’s denial be accepted?\nNot wavering from her contemplation of Waff, Odrade said: “But, M’Lord Tuek, was not the prospect of increased income attractive to you?” She saw Waff’s right arm come around slightly, almost aimed at her. His intentions became Clear.\n“M’Lord Tuek,” Odrade said, “this Tleilaxu intends to murder us both.”\nAt her words, Waff jerked both arms up, trying to aim at the two separated and difficult targets. Before his muscles responded, Odrade was under his guard. She heard the faint hiss of dart throwers but felt no sting. Her left arm came up in a Slashing blow to break Waff’s right arm. Her right foot broke his left arm.\nWaff screamed.\nHe had never suspected such speed in the Bene Gesserit. It was almost a match for what he had seen in the Honored Matre on the Ixian conference ship. Even through his pain he realized that he must report this. Reverend Mothers command synaptic bypasses under duress!\nThe door behind Odrade burst open. Waff’s Face Dancers rushed into the chamber. But Odrade already was behind Waff, both hands on his throat. “Stop or he dies!” she shouted.\nThe two froze.\nWaff squirmed under her hands.\n“Be still!” she commanded. Odrade glanced at Tuek sprawled on the floor to her right. One dart had hit its target.\n“Waff has killed the High Priest,” Odrade said, speaking for her own secret listeners.\nThe two Face Dancers continued to stare at her. Their indecision was easy to see. None of them, she saw, had\nrealized how this played into Bene Gesserit hands. Trap the Tleilaxu indeed!\nOdrade spoke to the Face Dancers. “Remove yourselves and that body to the corridor and close the door. Your Master has done a foolish thing. He will have need of you later.” To Waff, she said: “For the moment, you need me more than you need your Face Dancers. Send them away.”\n“Go,” Waff squeaked.\nWhen the Face Dancers continued to stare at her, Odrade said: “If you do not leave immediately, | will kill him and then | will dispatch both of you.”\n“Do it!” Waff screamed.\nThe Face Dancers took this as the command to obey their Master. Odrade heard something else in Waff’s voice. He obviously would have to be talked out of suicidal hysteria.\nOnce she was alone with him, Odrade removed the exhausted weapons from his sleeves and pocketed them. They could be examined in detail later. There was little she could do for his broken bones except render him briefly unconscious and set them. She improvised splints from cushions and torn strips of green fabric from the High Priest’s furnishings.\nWaff reawakened quickly. He groaned when he looked at Odrade.\n“You and | are now allies,” Odrade said. “The things that have transpired in this chamber have been heard by some of my people and by representatives from a faction that wants to replace Tuek with one of their own number.”\nIt was too fast for Waff. He was a moment grasping what she had said. His mind fastened, though, on the most important thing.\n“Allies?”\n“| imagine Tuek was difficult to deal with,” she said. “Offer him obvious benefits and he invariably waffled. You have done some of the priests a favor by killing him.”\n“They are listening now?” Waff squeaked.\n“Of course. Let us discuss your proposed spice monopoly. The late lamented High Priest said you mentioned this. Let me see if | can deduce the extent of your offer.”\n“My arms,” Waff moaned.\n“You're still alive,” she said. “Be thankful for my wisdom. | could have killed you.”\nHe turned his head away from her. “That would have been better.”\n“Not for the Bene Tleilax and certainly not for my Sisterhood,” she said. “Let me see. Yes, you promised to provide Rakis with many new spice harvesters, the new airborne ones, which only touch the desert with their sweeper heads.”\n“You listened!” Waff accused.\n“Not at all. A very attractive proposal, since I’m sure the Ixians are providing them free for their own reasons. Shall | continue?”\n“You said we are allies.”\n“A monopoly would force the Guild to buy more Ixian navigation machines,” she said. “You would have the Guild in the jaws of your crusher.”\nWaff lifted his head to glare at her. The movement sent agony through his broken arms and he groaned. Despite the pain, he studied Odrade through almost lidded eyes. Did the witches really believe that was the extent of the Tleilaxu plan? He hardly dared hope the Bene Gesserit were so misled.\n“Of course that was not your basic plan,” Odrade said.\nWaff’s eyes snapped wide open. She was reading his mind! “I am dishonored,” he said. “When you saved my life you saved a useless thing.” He sank back.\nOdrade inhaled a deep breath. Time to use the results of the Chapter House analyses. She leaned close to Waff and whispered in his ear: “The Shariat needs you yet.”\nWaff gasped.\nOdrade sat back. That gasp said it all. Analysis confirmed.\n“You thought you had better allies in the people from the Scattering,” she said. “Those Honored Matres and other hetairas of that ilk. | ask you: does the slig make alliance with its garbage?”\nWaff had heard that question uttered only in khel. His face pale, he breathed in shallow gasps. The implications in her words! He forced himself to ignore the pain in his arms. Allies, she said. She knew about the Shariat! How could she possibly know?\n“How can either of us be unmindful of the many advantages in an alliance between Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit?” Odrade asked.\nAlliance with the powindah witches? Waff’s mind was filled with turmoil. The agony of his arms was held so tentatively at bay. This moment felt so fragile! He tasted acid bile on the back of his tongue.\n“Ahhhh,” Odrade said. “Do you hear that? The priest, Krutansik, and his faction have arrived outside our door. They will propose that one of your Face Dancers assume the guise of the late Hedley Tuek. Any other course would cause too much turmoil. Krutansik is a fairly wise man who has held himself in the background until now. His Uncle Stiros groomed him well.”\n“What does your Sisterhood gain from alliance with us?” Waff managed.\nOdrade smiled. Now she could speak the truth. That was always much easier and often the most powerful argument.\n“Our survival in the face of the storm that is brewing among the Scattered Ones,” she said. “Tleilaxu survival, too. The farthest thing from our desires is an end to those who preserve the Great Belief.”\nWaff cringed. She spoke it openly! Then he understood. What matter if others heard? They could not see through to the secrets beneath her words.\n“Our breeding mothers are ready for you,” Odrade said. She stared hard into his eyes and made the handsign of a\nZensunni priest.\nWaff felt a tight band release itself from his breast. The unexpected, the unthinkable, the unbelievable thing was true! The Bene Gesserit were not powindah! All the universe would yet follow the Bene Tleilax into the True Faith! God would not permit otherwise. Especially not here on the planet of the Prophet!\nBureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top of the heap look inept.

Such material often required a Mentat for translation or, what was worse, in times of extreme fatigue demanded that she delve into Other Memories. All Archivists were Mentats, of course, but this did not reassure Taraza. You could never consult Archival Records in a straightforward manner. Much of the interpretation that emerged from that source had to be accepted on the word of the ones who brought it or\n(hateful!) you had to rely on the mechanical search by the holosystem. This, in its turn, required a dependency on those who maintained the system. It gave functionaries more power than Taraza cared to delegate.\nDependencies!\nTaraza hated dependency. This was a rueful admission, reminding her that few developing situations were ever precisely what you imagined they would be. Even the best of Mentat projections accumulated errors ... given enough time.\nStill, every move the Sisterhood made required the consultation of Archives and seemingly endless analyses. Even ordinary commerce demanded it. She found this a frequent irritation. Should they form this group? Sign that agreement?\nThere always came the moment during a conference when she was forced to introduce a note of decision:\n“Analysis by Archivist Hesterion accepted.”\nOr, as was often the case: “Archivists’ report rejected; not pertinent.”\nTaraza leaned forward to study the holoprojection: “Possible breeding plan for Subject Waff.”\nShe scanned the numbers, gene plans from the cell sample forwarded by Odrade. Fingernail scrapings seldom produced enough material for a secure analysis but Odrade had done quite well under the cover of setting the man’s broken bones. Taraza shook her head at the data. Offspring would surely be like all the previous ones the Bene Gesserit had attempted with Tleilaxu: The females would be immune to memory probing: males, of course, would be an impenetrable and repellent chaos.\nTaraza sat back and sighed. When it came to breeding records, the monumental cross-referencing assumed staggering proportions. Officially, it was the “College of Ancestral Pertinence,” CAP to the Archivists. Among the Sisters at large, it was Known as the “Stud Record,” which,\nalthough accurate, failed to convey the sense of detail listed under the proper Archival headings. She had asked for Waff’s projections to be carried out into three hundred generations, an easy and rather rapid task, sufficient for all practical purposes. Three-hundred-Gen mainlines (Such as Teg, his collaterals and siblings) had proved themselves dependable for millennia. Instinct told her it would be bootless to waste more time on the Waff projections.\nFatigue welled up in Taraza. She put her head in her hands and rested them for a moment on the table, feeling the coolness of the wood.\nWhat if | am wrong about Rakis?\nOpposition arguments could not be shuffled away into Archival dust. Damn this dependency on computers! The Sisterhood had carried its main lines in computers even back in the Forbidden Days after the Butlerian Jihad’s wild smashing of “the thinking machines.” In these “more enlightened” days, one tended not to question the unconscious motives behind that ancient orgy of destruction.\nSometimes, we make very responsible decisions for unconscious reasons. A conscious search of Archives or Other Memories carries no guarantees.\nTaraza released one of her hands and slapped it against the tabletop. She did not like dealing with the Archivists who came trotting in with answers to her questions. A disdainful lot they were, full of secret jokes. She had heard them comparing their CAP work to stock breeding, to Farm Forms and Animal Racing Authority. Damn their jokes! The right decision now was far more important than they could possibly imagine. Those serving sisters who only obeyed orders did not have Taraza’s responsibilities.\nShe lifted her head and looked across the room at the niche with its bust of Sister Chenoeh, the ancient one who had met and conversed with the Tyrant.\nYou knew, Taraza thought. You were never a Reverend Mother but still you knew. Your reports show it. How did you know to make the right decision?\nOdrade’s request for military assistance required an immediate answer. The time limits were too tight. But with Teg, Lucilla, and the ghola missing, the contingency plan had to be brought into play.\nDamn Teg!\nMore of his unexpected behavior. He could not leave the ghola in jeopardy, of course. Schwangyu’s actions had been predictable.\nWhat had Teg done? Had he gone to ground in Ysai or one of the other major cities on Gammu? No. If that were the case, Teg would have reported by now through one of the secret contacts they had prepared. He possessed a complete list of those contacts and had investigated some of them personally.\nObviously, Teg did not place full trust in the contacts. He had seen something during his inspection tour that he had not passed along through Bellonda.\nBurzmali would have to be called in and briefed, of course. Burzmali was the best, trained by Teg himself; prime candidate for Supreme Bashar. Burzmali must be sent to Gammu.\nI’m playing a hunch, Taraza thought.\nBut if Teg had gone to ground, the trail started on Gammu. The trail could have ended there as well. Yes, Burzmali to Gammu. Rakis must wait. There were certain obvious attractions in this move. It would not alert the Guild. The Tleilaxu and the ones from the Scattering, however, would certainly rise to the bait. If Odrade failed to trap the Tleilaxu ... no, Odrade would not fail. That one had become almost a certainty.\nThe unexpected.\nYou see, Milles? I have learned from you.\nNone of this deflected the opposition within the Sisterhood, though.\nTaraza put both palms flat on her table and pressed hard, as though trying to sense the people out there in Chapter House, the ones who shared Schwangyu’s opinions. Vocal opposition had subsided but that always meant the violence was being readied.\nWhat shall I do?\nThe Mother Superior was supposed to be immune to indecision in a crisis. But the Tleilaxu connection had unbalanced their data. Some of the recommendations for Odrade appeared obvious and already had been transmitted. That much of the plan was plausible and simple.\nTake Waff into the desert far beyond unwanted eyes. Contrive a situation-in-extremis and the consequent religious experience in the old and reliable pattern dictated by the Missionaria Protectiva. Test whether the Tleilaxu were using the ghola process for their own kind of immortality. Odrade was perfectly capable of carrying out that much of the revised plan. It depended heavily on this young woman, Sheeana, though.\nThe worm itself is the unknown.\nTaraza reminded herself that today’s worm was not the original worm of Rakis. Despite Sheeana’s demonstrated command over them, they were unpredictable. As Archives would say, they had no track record. Taraza held little doubt that Odrade had made an accurate deduction about the Rakians and their dances. That was a plus.\nA language.\nBut we do not yet speak it. That was a negative.\nI must make a decision tonight!\nTaraza sent her surface awareness roaming backward along that unbroken line of Mothers Superior, all of those female memories encapsulated within the fragile awareness of herself and two others—Bellonda and Hesterion. It was a\ntortuous track through Other Memories, which she felt too tired to follow. Right at the edge of the track would be observations of Muad’Dib, the Atreides bastard who had Shaken the universe twice—once by dominating the Imperium with his Fremen hordes, and then by spawning the Tyrant.\nIf we are defeated this time it could be the end of us, she thought. We could be swallowed whole by these hell- spawned females from the Scattering.\nAlternatives presented themselves: The female child on Rakis could be passed into the Sisterhood’s core to live out her life somewhere at the end of a no-ship’s flight. An ignominious retreat.\nSo much depended on Teg. Had he failed the Sisterhood at last or had he found an unexpected way to conceal the ghola?\n| must find a way to delay, Taraza thought. We must give Teg time to communicate with us. Odrade will have to drag out the plan on Rakis.\nIt was dangerous but it had to be done.\nStiffly, Taraza lifted herself from her chairdog and went to the darkened window across from her. Chapter House Planet lay in star-shadowed darkness. A refuge: Chapter House Planet. Such planets were not even recipients of names anymore; only numbers somewhere in Archives. This planet had seen fourteen hundred years of Bene Gesserit occupancy but even that must be considered temporary. She thought of the guardian no-ships orbiting overhead: Teg’s own defense system in depth. Still, Chapter House remained vulnerable.\nThe problem had a name: “accidental discovery.”\nIt was an eternal flaw. Out there in the Scattering, humankind expanded exponentially, swarming across unlimited space. The Tyrant’s Golden Path secure at last. Or was it? Surely, the Atreides worm had planned more than the simple survival of the species.\nHe did something to us that we have not yet unearthed— even after all of these millennia. | think | know what he did. My opposition says otherwise.\nIt was never easy for a Reverend Mother to contemplate the bondage they had suffered under Leto II as he whipped his Imperium for thirty-five hundred years along his Golden Path.\nWe stumble when we review those times.\nSeeing her own reflection in the window’s dark plaz, Taraza glared at herself. It was a grim face and the fatigue easily visible.\n| have every right to be tired and grim!\nShe knew that her training had channeled her deliberately into negative patterns. These were her defenses and her strengths. She remained distant in all human relationships, even in the seductions she had performed for the Breeding Mistresses. Taraza was the perpetual devil’s advocate and this had become a dominant force in the entire Sisterhood, a natural consequence of her elevation to Mother Superior. Opposition developed easily in that environment.\nAs the Sufis said: Rot at the core always spreads outward.\nWhat they did not say was that some rots were noble and valuable.\nShe reassured herself now with her more dependable data: The Scattering took the Tyrant’s lessons outward in the human migrations, changed in unknown ways but ultimately submissive to recognition. And in time, a way would be found to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility. Taraza did not think the people of the Scattering had found this—at least not the ones skulking back into the places that had Spawned them.\nThere was absolutely no safe course through the conflicting forces, but she thought the Sisterhood had armed itself as well as it could. The problem was akin to that of a\nGuild navigator threading his ship through the folds of space in a way that avoided collisions and entrapments.\nEntrapments, they were the key, and there was Odrade springing the Sisterhood’s traps on the Tleilaxu.\nWhen Taraza", " Rot at the core always spreads outward.\nWhat they did not say was that some rots were noble and valuable.\nShe reassured herself now with her more dependable data: The Scattering took the Tyrant’s lessons outward in the human migrations, changed in unknown ways but ultimately submissive to recognition.

It was as though she looked at a faded tapestry in which some figures remained bright. Brightest of all, assuring Odrade’s position close to the seats of Sisterhood command, was her Capacity for cutting across details and getting at the Surprising meat of a conflict. It was a form of that dangerous Atreides prescience working secretly within her. Using this hidden talent was the one thing that had aroused the most opposition, and it was the one argument that Taraza admitted had the most validity. That thing working far below the surface, its hidden movements indicated only by occasional turbulence, that was the problem!\n“Use her but stand ready to eliminate her,” Taraza had argued. “We will still have most of her offspring.”\nTaraza knew she could depend on Lucilla... provided Lucilla had found sanctuary somewhere with Teg and the ghola. Alternate assassins existed at the Keep on Rakis, of course. That weapon might have to be armed soon.\nTaraza experienced a sudden turmoil within herself. Other Memories advised caution in the utmost. Never again lose control of the breeding lines! Yes, if Odrade escaped an elimination attempt, she would be alienated forever. Odrade was a full Reverend Mother and some of those must still remain out there in the Scattering—not among the Honored Matres the Sisterhood had observed... but still...\nNever Again! That was the operational motto. Never another Kwisatz Haderach or another Tyrant.\nControl the breeders: Control their offspring.\nReverend Mothers did not die when their flesh died. They sank farther and farther into the Bene Gesserit living core\nuntil their casual instructions and even their unconscious observations became a part of the continuing Sisterhood.\nMake no mistakes about Odrade!\nThe response to Odrade required specific tailoring and exquisite care. Odrade, who allowed certain limited affections, “a mild warmth,” she called them, argued that emotions provided valuable insights if you did not let them govern you. Taraza saw this mild warmth as a way into the heart of Odrade, a vulnerable opening.\n| know what you think of me, Dar, with your mild warmth toward an old companion from school days. You think l am a potential danger to the Sisterhood but that I can be saved from myself by watchful “friends.”\nTaraza knew that some of her advisors shared Odrade’s opinion, listened quietly and reserved judgment. Most of them still followed the Mother Superior’s lead but many knew of Odrade’s wild talent and had recognized Odrade’s doubts. Only one thing kept most of the Sisters in line and Taraza did not try to delude herself about it.\nEvery Mother Superior acted out of a profound loyalty to her Sisterhood. Nothing must endanger Bene Gesserit continuity, not even herself. In her precise and harshly self- judgmental way, Taraza examined her relationship to the Sisterhood’s continuing life.\nObviously, there was no immediate necessity to eliminate Odrade. Yet, Odrade was now so close to the center of the ghola design that little occurring there could escape her sensitive observation. Much that had not been revealed to her would become known. The Atreides Manifesto had been almost a gamble. Odrade, the obvious person to produce the Manifesto, could only achieve a deeper insight as she wrote the document, but the words themselves were the ultimate barrier to revelation.\nWaff would appreciate that, Taraza knew.\nTurning from the dark window, Taraza went back to her chairdog. The moment of crucial decision—go or no-go—\ncould be delayed but intermediate steps must be taken. She composed a sample message in her mind and examined it while sending a summons to Burzmali. The Bashar’s favorite student would have to be sent into action but not as Odrade wanted.\nThe message to Odrade was essentially simple:\n“Help is on the way. You are on the scene, Dar. Where safety of girl Sheeana is concerned, use own judgment. In all other matters that do not conflict with my orders, carry out the plan.”\nThere. That was it. Odrade had her instructions, the essentials that she would accept as “the plan” even while she would recognize an incomplete pattern. Odrade would obey. The “Dar” was a nice touch, Taraza thought. Dar and Tar. That opening into Odrade’s mild warmth would not be well shielded from the Dar-and-Tar direction.\nThe long table on the right is set for a banquet of roast desert hare in sauce cepeda. The other dishes, clockwise to the right from the far end of the table, are aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (note the hawk crest of the Atreides on the urn), pot-a-oie and, in the Balut crystal bottle, sparkling Caladan wine. Note the ancient poison detector concealed in the chandelier.\n—DAR-ES-BALAT, DESCRIPTION AT A MUSEUM DISPLAY\nTe found Duncan in the tiny dining alcove off the no- globe’s gleaming kitchen. Pausing in the passage to the alcove, Teg studied Duncan carefully: eight days here and the lad appeared finally to have recovered from the peculiar rage that had seized him as they entered the globe’s access tube.\nThey had come through a shallow cave musky with the odors of a native bear. The rocks at the back of the lair were not rocks, although they would have deceived even the most sophisticated examination. A slight protrusion in the rocks would shift if you knew or stumbled upon the secret code. That circular and twisting movement opened the entire rear wall of the cave.\nThe access tube, brilliantly lighted automatically once they sealed the portal behind them, was decorated with Harkonnen griffins on walls and ceiling. Teg was struck by the image of a young Patrin stumbling into this place for the first time (The shock! The awe! The elation!) and he failed to observe Duncan’s reaction until a low growl swelled in the enclosed space.\nDuncan stood growling (almost a moan), fists clenched, gaze fixed on a Harkonnen griffin along the right-hand wall. Rage and confusion warred for supremacy on his face. He\nlifted both fists and crashed them against the raised figure, drawing blood from his hands.\n“Damn them to the deepest pits of hell!” he shouted.\nIt was an oddly mature curse issuing from the youthful mouth.\nThe instant the words were out Duncan relapsed into uncontrolled shudders. Lucilla put an arm around him and stroked his neck in a soothing, almost sensual way, until the shuddering subsided.\n“Why did I do that?” Duncan whispered.\n“You will Know when your original memories are restored,” she said.\n“Harkonnens,” Duncan whispered and blood suffused his face. He looked up at Lucilla. “Why do | hate them so much?”\n“Words cannot explain it,” she said. “You will have to wait for the memories.”\n“I don’t want the memories!” Duncan shot a startled look at Teg. “Yes! Yes, | do want them.”\nLater as he looked up at Teg in the no-globe’s dining alcove, Duncan’s memory obviously returned to that moment.\n“When, Bashar?”\n“Soon.”\nTeg glanced around the area. Duncan sat alone at the auto-scrubbed table, a cup of brown liquid in front of him. Teg recognized the smell: one of the many melange-laced items from the nullentropy bins. The bins were a treasure house of exotic foods, clothing, weapons, and other artifacts —a museum whose value could not be calculated. There was a thin layer of dust all through the globe but no deterioration of the things stored here. Every bit of the food was laced with melange, not at an addict level unless you were a glutton, but always noticeable. Even the preserved fruit had been dusted with the spice.\nThe brown liquid in Duncan’s cup was one of the things Lucilla had tasted and pronounced capable of sustaining life. Teg did not know precisely how Reverend Mothers did this, but his own mother had been capable of it. One taste and they knew the contents of food or drink.\nA glance at the ornate clock set into the wall at the closed end of the alcove told Teg it was later than he thought, well into the third hour of their arbitrary afternoon. Duncan Should still be up on the elaborate practice floor but they both had seen Lucilla take off into the globe’s upper reaches and Teg saw this as a chance for them to talk unobserved.\nPulling up a chair, Teg seated himself on the opposite side of the table.\nDuncan said, “I hate those clocks!”\n“You hate everything here,” Teg said, but he took a second look at the clock. It was another antique, a round face with two analog hands and a digital second counter. The two hands were priapean—naked human figures: a large male with enormous phallus and a smaller female with legs spread wide. Each time the two clock hands met, the male appeared to enter the female.\n“Gross,” Teg agreed. He pointed to Duncan’s drink: “You like that?”\n“It’s all right, sir. Lucilla says | should have it after exercise.”\n“My mother used to make me a similar drink for after heavy exertions,” Teg said. He leaned forward and inhaled, remembering the aftertaste, the cloying melange in his nostrils.\n“Sir, how long must we stay here?” Duncan asked.\n“Until we are found by the right people or until we’re sure we will not be found.”\n“But... cut off in here, how will we know?”\n“When I judge it’s time, l'Il take the life-shield blanket and start keeping watch outside.”\n“I hate this place!”\n“Obviously. But have you learned nothing about patience?”\nDuncan grimaced. “Sir, why are you keeping me from being alone with Lucilla?”\nTeg, exhaling as Duncan spoke, locked on the partial exhalation and then resumed breathing. He knew, though, that the lad had observed. If Duncan knew, then Lucilla must know!\n“| don’t think Lucilla knows what you’re doing, sir,” Duncan said, “but it’s getting pretty obvious.” He glanced around him. “If this place didn’t take so much of her attention . .. Where does she dash off to like that?”\n“I think she’s up in the library.”\n“Library!”\n“I agree it’s primitive but it’s also fascinating.” Teg lifted his gaze to the scrollwork on the nearby kitchen ceiling. The moment of decision had arrived. Lucilla could not be depended upon to remain distracted much longer. Teg Shared her fascination, though. It was easy to lose yourself in these marvels.
