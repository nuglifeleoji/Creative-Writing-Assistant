This year is marked by two pivotal events: the battle and the death of the general Xiahou Yuan, and the ascension of Liu Bei, also known as 玄德, to the position of 汉中王 (King of Han).\n\nDuring 建安二十四年, the military landscape was tumultuous, with various factions vying for power amidst the decline of the Han dynasty. Xiahou Yuan, a prominent general serving under Cao Cao, played a crucial role in the military campaigns of this period. His death during a battle signifies a turning point in the ongoing conflicts, highlighting the intense struggles for dominance among the warlords of the time.\n\nSimultaneously, this year also marks a significant moment for Liu Bei, who, through his strategic alliances and military successes, ascended to the title of 汉中王. This title not only represented a claim to legitimacy and authority but also underscored Liu Bei's ambitions to restore the Han dynasty and unify the realm under his leadership. His rise to power during this year is a critical development in the historical narrative of the Three Kingdoms period, setting the stage for future conflicts and alliances.\n\nIn summary, 建安二十四年 is characterized by the intertwining fates of key historical figures, with Xiahou Yuan's military endeavors culminating in his death, while Liu Bei's political maneuvers lead to his elevation as 汉中王.
