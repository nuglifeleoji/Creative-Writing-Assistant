有病乱求医，并没抱多大希望，可不久老朋友却热心地回了信，说离柳林镇二里路有一个女子，愿意跟玉亭。老陶说玉亭大概也认识这女娃娃，这女子在柳林镇小学和玉亭同过学，官名叫贺凤英。 \n　　玉亭的确认识凤英，于是就亲自去了一趟柳林镇，把贺凤英当下就接回来了。玉厚立马闹腾着借钱借粮，尽量体面地给弟弟办了婚事。接着又搬家腾窑，另起了炉灶……前后一折腾，除借窑住不算，还欠下一河滩帐债，使他许多年日子都翻不过来。 \n　　到后来，玉亭因为不会劳动，加上贺凤英不会过光景，日子过得没棱没沿，连他的光景也不如了。但他除过能供得起他旱烟和一碗剩饭外，再没有能力照管他了……但话说回来，孙玉亭本人觉得，他现在穷是穷，倒也自有他活人的一番畅快。 \n　　玉亭是大队党支部委员、农田基建队队长、贫下中农管理学校委员会主任，一身三职，在村里也是一个人物。全村开个大会，尽管他衣服不太体面，但也常是坐主席台的人。他又有文化，上面来个什么文件或材料，书记田福堂和副书记金俊山都不识字，回回都是他给众人宣读。这时候，全村大人娃娃的目光，都集中在他身上，使他感到非常的满足，把饥肠饿肚早已忘得一干二净。 \n　　只是回到家里，三个孩子饿得嚎哇哭叫，她老婆又跑出去为骂仗的村妇去调解是非，上顿饭的碗筷都没洗撂在锅台上，这时他才感到对生活有点灰心。 \n　　他一个人坐在灶火圪崂拉风箱，饭还没熟，三个孩子象土匪一样扒在锅上，三下五除二就吃得差不多了。这时他也不由地想起了早年间太原钢厂的好吃好喝。顿顿白蒸馍大肉菜，喷鼻香！那时他一顿才吃三个白馍？真是不可思议！要是现在的话…… \n　　他在家里胡乱吃喝一点，就又投身到轰轰烈烈的革命运动中去了。只有在这社会的大风大浪中，他才把饿肚子放在一边，精神上享受着一种无限的快活。 \n　　自从石圪节公社集中十几个队的民工在他们双水村搞农田基建大会战以来，孙玉亭更是兴奋得不得了。会战总指挥是公社副主任徐治功，副总指挥是公社武装专干杨高虎。后来公社又研究，要在各队的基建队长中间抽一个人担任副总指挥。因为会战在双水村，这差事当然就落在了孙玉亭的身上。立刻，他在工地上跑前跑后，动不动还在高音喇叭上发布各种通知和命令；他哥当年没把他造就\n######################\nOutput:",
