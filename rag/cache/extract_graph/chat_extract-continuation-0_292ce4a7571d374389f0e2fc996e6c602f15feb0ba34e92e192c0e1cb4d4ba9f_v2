Have you observed our good Mentat? You should’ve learned something from this exchange.”\n“But, Uncle—”\n“A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”\n“Yes, but—”\n“Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might’ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he’s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, Piter, but he still can err.”\nPiter spoke in a low, sullen tone: “Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism, Baron?”\n“Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. | wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.”\n“Are you already training my replacement?” Piter demanded.\n“Replace you? Why, Piter, where could | find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?”\n“The same place you found me, Baron.”\n“Perhaps | should at that,” the Baron mused. “You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!”\n“Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?”\n“My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could | object to that? | merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.”\n“Then I’m on display,” Piter said. “Shall | dance? Shall | perform my various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau—”\n“Precisely,” the Baron said. “You are on display. Now, be silent.” He glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew’s lips, the full and pouting look of them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. “This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties. The fact that it’s encased in a human body, however, must not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. | sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea.”\n“They were toys compared to me,” Piter snarled. “You yourself, Baron, could outperform those machines.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron said. “Ah, well....” He took a deep breath, belched. “Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.”\n“Baron, I’ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My observations of—”\n“I'll be the judge of this,” the Baron said. “I give you an order, Mentat. Perform one of your various\nfunctions.”\n“So be it,” Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity—as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. “In a few days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a Spacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of Arrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke’s Mentat, Thufir Hawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.”\n“Listen carefully, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Observe the plans within plans within plans.”\nFeyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his heir.\n“There are several tangential possibilities,” Piter said. “I indicate that House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium.”\n“The Duke’s too proud a man for that,” the Baron said.\n“It is a possibility,” Piter said. “The ultimate effect for us would be the same, however.”\n“No, it would not!” the Baron growled. “I must have him dead and his line ended.”\n“That’s the high probability,” Piter said. “There are certain preparations that indicate when a House is\ngoing renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none of these things.”\n“So,” the Baron sighed. “Get on with it, Piter.”\n“At Arrakeen,” Piter said, “the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.”\n“The Ambassador to the Smugglers,” the Baron chuckled.\n“Ambassador to what?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\n“Your uncle makes a joke,” Piter said. “He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor’s interest in smuggling operations on Arrakis.”\nFeyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. “Why?”\n“Don’t be dense, Feyd,” the Baron snapped. “As long as the Guild remains effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could spies and assassins move about?”\nFeyd-Rautha’s mouth made a soundless “Oh-h-h- h.”\n“We've arranged diversions at the Residency,” Piter said. “There’ll be an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir—an attempt which could succeed.”\n“Piter,” the Baron rumbled, “you indicated—”\n“I indicated accidents can happen,” Piter said. “And the attempt must appear valid.”\n“Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,” the Baron said. “Of course, he’s potentially more dangerous than the father...with that witch mother training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.”\n“Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,” Piter said. “The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial Conditioning— Supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It’s assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as Someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.”\n“How?” Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew you couldn’t subvert Imperial Conditioning!\n“Another time,” the Baron said. “Continue, Piter.\n“In place of Yueh,” Piter said, “we’ll drag a most interesting suspect across Hawat’s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to Hawat’s attention.”\n“Her?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\n“The Lady Jessica herself,” the Baron said.\n“Is it not sublime?” Piter asked. “Hawat’s mind will be so filled with this prospect it'll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.” Piter frowned, then: “But | don’t think he'll be able to carry it off.”\n“You don’t want him to, eh?” the Baron asked.\n“Don’t distract me,” Piter said. “While Hawat’s occupied with the Lady Jessica, we'll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe\n”\nhe’s gaining a measure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we'll signal Yueh and move in with our major force...ah....”\n“Go ahead, tell him all of it,” the Baron said.\n“We'll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in Harkonnen livery.”\n“Sardaukar!” Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.\n“You see how | trust you, Feyd,” the Baron said. “No hint of this must ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial House and there’d be chaos.”\n“The main point,” Piter said, “is this: since House Harkonnen is being used to do the Imperial dirty work, we've gained a true advantage. It’s a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.”\n“You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we'll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company.”\nFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company’s coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships—they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of\nvoting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.\n“The Duke Leto,” Piter said, “may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert’s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty’s agents—the planetary ecologist. You may remember him—Kynes.”\n“Feyd remembers him,” the Baron said. “Get on with it.”\n“You do not drool very prettily, Baron,” Piter said.\n“Get on with it, | command you!” the Baron roared.\nPiter shrugged. “If matters go as planned,” he said, “House Harkonnen will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.”\n“More profits,” Feyd-Rautha said.\n“Indeed,” the Baron said. And he thought: /t’s only Just. We’re the ones who tamed Arrakis...except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert...and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool.\n“And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,” Piter said. “They will know.”\n“They will know,” the Baron breathed.\n“Loveliest of all,” Piter said, “is that the Duke will know, too. He knows now. He can already feel the trap.”\n“It’s true the Duke knows,” the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. “He could not help but know...more’s the pity.”\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. AS he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension—grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.\n“lam hungry,” the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. “Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.”\nThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: “The Reverend Mother must combine\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>The Baron is a powerful and manipulative leader of House Harkonnen, known for his cunning and cruelty.
