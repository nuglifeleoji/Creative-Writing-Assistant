郭淮、孙礼休走！司马懿之计，安能瞒得过吾？他每日令人在前交战，却教汝等袭吾军后。武都、阴平吾已取了。汝二人不早来降，欲驱兵与吾决战耶？”郭淮、孙礼听毕，大慌。忽然背后喊杀连天，王平、姜维引兵从后杀来。兴、苞二将又引军从前面杀来。两下夹攻，魏兵大败。郭、孙二人弃马爬山而走。张苞望见，骤马赶来；不期连人带马，跌入涧内，后军急忙救起，头已跌破。孔明令人送回成都养病。\n\n    却说郭、孙二人走脱，回见司马懿曰：“武都、阴平二郡已失。孔明伏于要路，前后攻杀，因此大败，弃马步行，方得逃回。”懿曰：“非汝等之罪，孔明智在吾先。可再引兵守把雍、郿二城，切勿出战。吾自有破敌之策。”二人拜辞而去。懿又唤张郃、戴陵分付曰：“今孔明得了武都、阴平，必然抚百姓以安民心，不在营中矣。汝二人各引一万精兵，今夜起身，抄在蜀兵营后，一齐奋勇杀将过来；吾却引军在前布阵，只待蜀兵势乱，吾大驱士马，攻杀进去：两军并力，可夺蜀寨也。若得此地山势，破敌何难？”二人受计引兵而去。\n\n    戴陵在左，张郃在右，各取小路进发，深入蜀兵之后。三更时分，来到大路，两军相遇，合兵一处，却从蜀兵背后杀来。行不到三十里，前军不行。张、戴二人自纵马视之，只见数百辆草车横截去路。郃曰：“此必有准备。可急取路而回。”才传令退军，只见满山火光齐明，鼓角大震，伏兵四下皆出，把二人围住。孔明在祁山上大叫曰：“戴陵、张郃可听吾言：司马懿料吾往武都、阴平抚民，不在营中，故令汝二人来劫吾寨，却中吾之计也。汝二人乃无名下将，吾不杀害，下马早降！”郃大怒，指孔明而骂曰：“汝乃山野村夫，侵吾大国境界，如何敢发此言！吾若捉住汝时，碎尸万段！”言讫，纵马挺枪，杀上山来。山上矢石如雨，郃不能上山，乃拍马舞枪，冲出重围，无人敢当。蜀兵困戴陵在垓心。郃杀出旧路，不见戴陵，即奋勇翻身又杀入重围，救出戴陵而回。孔明在山上，见郃在万军之中，往来冲突，英勇倍加，乃谓左右曰：“尝闻张翼德大战张郃，人皆惊惧。吾今日见之，方知其勇也。若留下此人，必为蜀中之害。吾当除之。”遂收军还营。\n\n
