Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward the outer door.\nThe Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ship’s side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. “We will make our stand here!” the Emperor ordered.\nAnother crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber admitting windblown sand and the sound of shouting. A small, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light—Alia darting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect the Emperor’s retreat.\n“Save yourself, Sire!” a Sardaukar officer shouted. “Into the ship!”\nBut the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors. A forty-meter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the selamlik’s doors opened now onto drifting sand. A dust cloud hung low over the outside world blowing from pastel distances. Static lightning crackled from the cloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted out by the storm’s charge could be seen through the haze. The plain surged with figures in combat—Sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed men who seemed to come down out of the storm.\nAll this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor’s pointing hand.\nOut of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes—great rising curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of Sandworms, a massed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack. They came in a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on the plain.\nOnward toward the Emperor’s hutment they came while the House Sardaukar stood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their minds found difficult to accept.\nBut the figures leaping from the worm backs were men, and the blades flashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had been trained to face. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man to man on the plain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar bodyguard pressed the Emperor back into the ship, sealed the door on him, and prepared to die at the door as part of his shield.\nIn the shock of comparative silence within the ship, the Emperor stared at the wide-eyed faces of his suite, seeing his oldest daughter with the flush of exertion on her cheeks, the old Truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her hood pulled about her face, finding at last the faces he sought—the two Guildsmen. They wore the Guild gray, unadorned, and it seemed to fit the calm they maintained despite the high emotions around them.\nThe taller of the two, though, held a hand to his left eye. As the Emperor watched, someone jostled\nthe Guildsman’s arm, the hand moved, and the eye was revealed. The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses, and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black.\nThe smaller of the pair eloowed his way a step nearer the Emperor, said: “We cannot know how it will go.” And the taller companion, hand restored to eye, added in a cold voice: “But this Muad’Dib cannot know, either.”\nThe words shocked the Emperor out of his daze. He checked the scorn on his tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild navigator’s single- minded focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain. Were these two so dependent upon their faculty that they had lost the use of their eyes and their reason? he wondered.\n“Reverend Mother,” he said, “we must devise a plan.”\nShe pulled the hood from her face, met his gaze with an unblinking stare. The look that passed between them carried complete understanding. They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.\n“Summon Count Fenring from his quarters,” the Reverend Mother said.\nThe Padishah Emperor nodded, waved for one of his aides to obey that command.\nHe was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad’Dib’s motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad’Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies’ skins, the Muad’Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: “I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.”\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| t was to the Arrakeen governor’s mansion, the old Residency the Atreides had first occupied on Dune, that they escorted Paul-Muad’Dib on the evening of his victory. The building stood as Rabban had restored it, virtually untouched by the fighting although there had been looting by townspeople. Some of the furnishings in the main hall had been overturned or smashed.\nPaul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a pace behind. Their escort fanned out into the Great Hall, straightening the place and clearing an area for Muad’Dib. One Squad began investigating that no sly trap had been planted here.\n“| remember the day we first came here with your father,” Gurney said. He glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. “I didn’t like this place then and | like it less now. One of our caves would be safer.”\n“Spoken like a true Fremen,” Stilgar said, and he marked the cold smile that his words brought to Muad’Dib’s lips. “Will you reconsider, Muad’Dib?”\n“This place is a symbol,” Paul said. “Rabban lived here. By occupying this place | seal my victory for all to understand. Send men through the building. Touch nothing. Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys remain.”\n“AS you command,” Stilgar said, and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he turned to obey.\nCommunications men hurried into the room with their equipment, began setting up near the massive fireplace. The Fremen guard that augmented the Surviving Fedaykin took up stations around the room. There was muttering among them, much darting of Suspicious glances. This had been too long a place of the enemy for them to accept their presence in it casually.\n“Gurney, have an escort bring my mother and Chani,” Paul said. “Does Chani know yet about our son?”\n“The message was sent, m’Lord.”\n“Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet?”\n“Yes, m’Lord. The storm’s almost spent.”\n“What’s the extent of the storm damage?” Paul asked.\n“In the direct path—on the landing field and across the spice storage yards of the plain—extensive damage,” Gurney said. “As much from battle as from the storm.”\n“Nothing money won't repair, | presume,” Paul said.\n“Except for the lives, m’Lord,” Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: “When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?”\nBut Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps visible to him in the time-wall that still lay across his path. Through each gap the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future.\nHe sighed, crossed the hall, seeing a chair against the wall. The chair had once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father. At the moment, though, it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from the men. He sat down, pulling his robes around his legs, loosening his stillsuit at the neck.\n“The Emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship,” Gurney said.\n“For now, contain him there,” Paul said. “Have they found the Harkonnens yet?”\n“They're still examining the dead.”\n“What reply from the ships up there?” He jerked his chin toward the ceiling.\n“No reply yet, m’Lord.”\nPaul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said: “Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We\nmust send a message to our Emperor. It’s time to discuss terms.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\nGurney turned away, dropped a hand signal to one of the Fedaykin who took up close-guard position beside Paul.\n“Gurney,” Paul whispered. “Since we've been rejoined I’ve yet to hear you produce the proper quotation for the event.” He turned, saw Gurney swallow, saw the sudden grim hardening of the man’s jaw.\n“As you wish, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He cleared his throat, rasped: “‘And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.”\nPaul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as he had once waited to mourn his father. Now, he gave his thoughts over to this day’s accumulated discoveries—the mixed futures and the hidden presence of Alia within his awareness.\nOf all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. “I have breasted the future to place my words where only you can hear them,” Alia had said. “Even you cannot do that, my brother. | find it an interesting play. And...oh, yes—l’ve killed our grandfather, the demented old Baron. He had very little pain.”\nSilence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal.\n“Muad’Dib.”\nPaul opened his eyes to see Stilgar’s black- bearded visage above him, the dark eyes glaring with\nbattle light.\n“You've found the body of the old Baron,” Paul said.\nA hush of the person settled over Stilgar. “How could you know?” he whispered. “We just found the body in that great pile of metal the Emperor built.”\nPaul ignored the question, seeing Gurney return accompanied by two Fremen who supported a captive Sardaukar.\n“Here’s one of them, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of Paul.\nThe Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers.\n“I think this one’s an officer, m’Lord,” Gurney said.\nPaul nodded, said: “I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that, man?”\nThe Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.\n“Speak up,” Paul said, “or your Emperor may die.”\nThe man blinked, swallowed.\n“Who am I?” Paul demanded.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a Fremen-trained individual who is skilled in combat and assassination, as seen when she darts out to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded during the battle.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The Emperor is a central figure in the conflict, commanding the Sardaukar and attempting to retreat during the battle.
