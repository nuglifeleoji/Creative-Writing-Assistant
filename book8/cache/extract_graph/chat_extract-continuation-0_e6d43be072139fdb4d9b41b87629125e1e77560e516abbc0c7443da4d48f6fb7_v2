  “牧老师，我没事。”蓝轩宇挣扎着从模拟舱中爬出来，再次晃了晃脑袋。他确实觉得自己有点变化，但并不是不好的，而是好像变强了一些。\n\n    他自己也不知道是怎么回事，发出那一声龙吟之后，体内的暴躁似乎也找到了宣泄口，然后整个人就特别疲惫。天斗星。\n\n    “哎哟，吓死我了，那个家伙。”冻千秋拍拍自己的小胸脯，一脸的震惊。\n\n    虽然当时她一听到龙吟声就迅速撤离了，可是，血脉还是受到了一点影响，全身战栗。\n\n    “咦，等一下，为什么那个家伙的龙吟声这么熟悉？”冻千秋眉头微蹙，双眸中光芒闪烁。\n\n    她歪着头在想着什么。考核结束，蓝轩宇意识回归，疲惫感也迅速消失了。\n\n    虽然精神有些萎靡，但他能感觉到，自己的魂力似乎提升了一些，胸口内那旋转着的金银双色旋涡好像也大了半分。\n\n    魂力具体提升了多少，显然要用仪器检测才能知道，但现在能有这种感觉还是很不错的。\n\n    蓝轩宇舒展了一下自己的身体，淡淡的微笑浮现在他脸上。虽然先前昏迷了，但后面发生的事情他还是知道的。\n\n    “刘锋，你这个卑鄙小人！”就在这时，一声怒吼响起。刚从模拟舱中爬出来，金翔就怒不可遏地朝着刘锋冲了过来。\n\n    此时刘锋也正在看蓝轩宇呢，顿时被金翔吓了一跳。\n\n    “住手！”大喝声响起。哪怕是怒气冲冲的金翔都吓了一跳，赶忙停了下来。\n\n    季洪彬缓步走了过来。看到这位大魔王，金翔打了个寒战，心中的冲动顿时去了大半。\n\n    季洪彬抬起手，指了指金翔：“轻敌大意，轻信他人。输了只怪你自己。”金翔的脸涨得通红：“季老师，我……”“不服气？如果这是真正的战场，你已经死了，还能在这儿叫嚣?”季洪彬毫不客气地说道。\n\n
