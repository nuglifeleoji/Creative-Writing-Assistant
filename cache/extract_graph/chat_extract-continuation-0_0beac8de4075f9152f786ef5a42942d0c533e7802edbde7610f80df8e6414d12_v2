They had contaminated him, but he’d accepted this rather than his view of this universe which Leto had chosen.\nThe sadness in Leto was so great he could not speak for several minutes. When he could manage his voice, Leto said: “So you baited Alia, tempted her and confused her into inaction and the wrong decisions. And now she knows who you are.”\n“She knows... Yes, she knows.”\nPaul’s voice was old then and filled with hidden protests. There was a reserve of defiance in him, though. He said: “IIl take the vision away from you if | can.”\n“Thousands of peaceful years,” Leto said. “That’s what l'Il give them.”\n“Dormancy! Stagnation!”\n“Of course. And those forms of violence which | permit. It'll be a lesson which humankind will never forget.”\n“I spit on your lesson!” Paul said. “You think I’ve not seen a thing similar to what you choose?”\n“You saw it,” Leto agreed.\n“Is your vision any better than mine?”\n“Not one whit better. Worse, perhaps,” Leto said.\n“Then what can | do but resist you?” Paul demanded.\n“Kill me, perhaps?”\n“I’m not that innocent. | know what you’ve set in motion. | know about the broken qanats and the unrest.”\n“And now Assan Tariq will never return to Shuloch. You must go back with me or not at all because this is my vision now.”\n“I choose not to go back.”\nHow old his voice sounds, Leto thought, and the thought was a wrenching pain. He said: “I’ve the hawk ring of the Atreides concealed in my dishdasha. Do you wish me to return it to you?”\n“If I'd only died,” Paul whispered. “I truly wanted to die when I went into the desert that night, but | knew | could not leave this world. | had to come back and—”\n“Restore the legend,” Leto said. “I know. And the jackals of Jacurutu were waiting for you that night as you knew they would be. They wanted your visions! You knew that.”\n“| refused. | never gave them one vision.”\n“But they contaminated you. They fed you spice essence and plied you with women and dreams. And you did have visions.”\n“Sometimes.” How sly his voice sounded.\n“Will you take back your hawk ring?” Leto asked.\nPaul sat down suddenly on the sand, a dark blotch in the Starlight. “No!”\nSo he knows the futility of that path, Leto thought. This revealed much, but not enough. The contest of the visions had moved from its delicate plane of choices down to a gross discarding of alternates. Paul knew he could not win, but he hoped yet to nullify that single vision to which Leto clung.\nPresently Paul said: “Yes, | was contaminated by the Jacurutu. But you contaminate yourself.”\n“That’s true,” Leto admitted. “I am your son.”\n“And are you a good Fremen?”\n“Yes.”\n“Will you permit a blind man to go into the desert finally? Will you let me find peace on my own terms?” He pounded the sand beside him.\n“No, l'Il not permit that,” Leto said. “But it’s your right to fall upon your knife if you insist upon it.”\n“And you would have my body!”\n“True.”\n“No!”\nAnd so he knows that path, Leto thought. The enshrining of Muad’Dib’s body by his son could be contrived as a form of cement for Leto’s vision.\n“You never told them, did you, father?” Leto asked.\n“I never told them.”\n“But | told them,” Leto said. “I told Muriz. Kralizec, the Typhoon Struggle.”\nPaul’s shoulders sagged. “You cannot,” he whispered. “You cannot.”\n“lam a creature of this desert now, father,” Leto said. “Would you speak thus to a Coriolis storm?”\n“You think me coward for refusing that path,” Paul said, his voice husky and trembling. “Oh, | understand you well, son. Augury and haruspication have always been their own torments. But | was never lost in the possible futures because this one is unspeakable!”\n“Your Jihad will be a summer picnic on Caladan by comparison,” Leto agreed. “l'Il take you to Gurney Halleck now.”\n“Gurney! He serves the Sisterhood through my mother.”\nAnd now Leto understood the extent of his father’s vision. “No, father. Gurney no longer serves anyone. | Know the place to find him and | can take you there. It’s time for the new legend to be created.”\n“I see that | cannot sway you. Let me touch you, then, for you are my son.”\nLeto held out his right hand to meet the groping fingers, felt their strength, matched it, and resisted every shift of\nPaul’s arm. “Not even a poisoned knife will harm me now,” Leto said. “I’m already a different chemistry.”\nTears slipped from the sightless eyes and Paul released his grip, dropped his hand to his side. “If l’d chosen your way, I'd have become the bicouros of shaitan. What will you become?”\n“For a time they'll call me the missionary of sha/tan, too,” Leto said. “Then they'll begin to wonder and, finally, they'll understand. You didn’t take your vision far enough, father. Your hands did good things and evil.”\n“But the evil was known after the event!”\n“Which is the way of many great evils,” Leto said. “You crossed over only into a part of my vision. Was your strength not enough?”\n“You know | couldn’t stay there. | could never do an evil act which was known before the act. I’m not Jacurutu.” He clambered to his feet. “Do you think me one of those who laughs alone at night?”\n“It is sad that you were never really Fremen,” Leto said. “We Fremen know how to commission the arifa. Our judges can choose between evils. It’s always been that way for us.”\n“Fremen, is it? Slaves of the fate you helped to make?” Paul stepped toward Leto, reached out in an oddly shy movement, touched Leto’s sheathed arm, explored up it to where the membrane exposed an ear, then the cheek and, finally, the mouth. “Ahhhh, that is your own flesh yet,” he said. “Where will that flesh take you?” He dropped his hand.\n“Into a place where humans may create their futures from instant to instant.”\n“So you say. An Abomination might say the same.”\n“I’m not Abomination, though | might’ve been,” Leto said. “I saw how it goes with Alia. A demon lives in her, father. Ghani and | know that demon: it’s the Baron, your grandfather.”\nPaul buried his face in his hands. His shoulders shook for a moment, then he lowered his hands and his mouth was\nset in a harsh line. “There is a curse upon our House. | prayed that you would throw that ring into the sand, that you’d deny me and run away to make... another life. It was there for you.”\n“At what price?”\nAfter a long silence, Paul said: “The end adjusts the path behind it. Just once | failed to fight for my principles. Just once. | accepted the Mahdinate. | did it for Chani, but it made me a bad leader.”\nLeto found he couldn’t answer this. The memory of that decision was there within him.\n“| cannot lie to you any more than | could lie to myself,” Paul said. “I know this. Every man should have such an auditor. | will only ask this one thing: is the Typhoon Struggle necessary?”\n“It’s that or humans will be extinguished.”\nPaul heard the truth in Leto’s words, spoke in a low voice which acknowledged the greater breadth of his son’s vision. “I did not see that among the choices.”\n“I believe the Sisterhood suspects it,” Leto said. “I cannot accept any other explanation of my grandmother’s decision.”\nThe night wind blew coldly around them then. It whipped Paul’s robe around his legs. He trembled. Seeing this, Leto said: “You’ve a kit, father. l'Il inflate the tent and we can spend this night in comfort.”\nBut Paul could only shake his head, knowing he would have no comfort from this night or any other. Muad’Dib, The Hero, must be destroyed. He’d said it himself. Only The Preacher could go on now.\nFremen were the first humans to develop a conscious/unconscious symbology through which to experience the movements and relationships of their planetary system. They were the first people anywhere to express climate in terms of a semi-mathematic language whose written symbols embody (and internalize) the external relationships. The language itself was part of the system it described. Its written form carried the shape of what it described. The intimate local knowledge of what was available to support life was implicit in this development. One can measure the extent of this language/system interaction by the fact that Fremen accepted themselves as foraging and browsing animals.\n—THE STORY OF LIET-KYNES BY HARQ AL-ADA\ndd Kaveh wahid,” Stilgar said. Bring coffee. He signaled\nwith a raised hand to an aide who stood at one side near the single door to the austere rock-walled room where he had spent this wakeful night. This was the place where the old Fremen Naib usually took his spartan breakfast, and it was almost breakfast time, but after such a night he did not feel hungry. He stood, stretching his muscles.\nDuncan Idaho sat on a low cushion near the door, trying to suppress a yawn. He had just realized that, while they talked, he and Stilgar had gone through an entire night.\n“Forgive me, Stil,” he said. “I’ve kept you up all night.”\n“To stay awake all night adds a day to your life,” Stilgar said, accepting the tray with coffee as it was passed in the door. He pushed a low bench in front of Idaho, placed the tray on it and sat across from his guest.\nBoth men wore the yellow robes of mourning, but Idaho’s was a borrowed garment worn because the people of Tabr had resented the Atreides green of his working uniform.\nStilgar poured the dark brew from the fat copper carafe, sipped first, and lifted his cup as a signal to Idaho—the\nancient Fremen custom: “It is safe; I have taken some of it.”\nThe coffee was Harah’s work, done just as Stilgar preferred it: the beans roasted to a rose-brown, ground to a fine powder in a stone mortar while still hot, and boiled immediately; a pinch of melange added.\nIdaho inhaled the spice-rich aroma, sipped carefully but noisily. He still did not know if he had convinced Stilgar. His mentat faculties had begun to work sluggishly in the early hours of the morning, all of his computations confronted at last by the inescapable datum supplied in the message from Gurney Halleck.\nAlia had known about Leto! She’d known.\nAnd Javid had to be a part of that knowing.\n“I must be freed of your restraints,” Idaho said at last, taking up the arguments once more.\nStilgar stood
