He is often recognized for his fierce loyalty to the Shu state and his commitment to the leadership of Zhuge Liang (孔明). Wei Yan played a crucial role in various military campaigns, including significant battles against the Mán people and the forces of Wei.\n\nThroughout his military career, Wei Yan demonstrated exceptional combat skills, particularly in ambush tactics and aggressive maneuvers. He was involved in key battles, such as those against the southern barbarians and during the defense of critical locations like the camp against enemy forces. His leadership was instrumental in rallying troops and executing strategies that often turned the tide in favor of the Shu army.\n\nWei Yan's contributions included leading troops against Chen Cang and participating in the defense strategies that captured enemy generals, such as Ling Bao (泠苞). He was also known for his role in the battle against Zhang He, where he displayed remarkable valor, although he faced challenges that led to retreats during engagements with the enemy.\n\nDespite his many successes, Wei Yan's ambition and assertiveness sometimes put him at odds with the Shu leadership. He was accused of treachery against Yang Yi and the late Prime Minister, which ultimately led to his downfall. In a tragic turn of events, he was executed by Ma Dai under the orders of Zhuge Liang, marking a significant and controversial moment in his legacy.\n\nWei Yan's military career was characterized by his eagerness to engage in battle, his willingness to take on dangerous missions, and his ability to inspire those around him. He was appointed as the governor of Hanzhong (汉中太守) by Liu Bei (玄德) and was known for his efforts to support the Shu cause, including his participation in the defense of Xiangyang.\n\nIn summary, Wei Yan is remembered as a complex figure in the history of the Shu Han kingdom, celebrated for his bravery and military skills while also facing scrutiny for his ambition and the circumstances surrounding his demise. His legacy remains a topic of interest in the narratives of the Three Kingdoms, illustrating the challenges and dynamics of loyalty, ambition, and leadership in a time of conflict.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "low"}}}], "created": 1754984085, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 1065, "total_tokens": 1528, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
