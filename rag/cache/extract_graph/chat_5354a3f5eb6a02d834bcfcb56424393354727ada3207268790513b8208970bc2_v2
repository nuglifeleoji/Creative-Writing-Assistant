Something she would not be required to explain to Murbella.\nHow do I soften the blow?\nThere were times when you could not soften it; in fact when it was kinder to rip off the bandages in one swift shot of agony.\n“Can this .. . this Duncan Idaho really give me back my memories from... before?”\n“He can and he will.”\n“Are we not being too precipitous?” Tamalane asked.\n“I’ve been studying accounts of the Bashar,” Teg said. “He was a famous military man and a Mentat.”\n“And you’re proud of that, | suppose?” Bell was taking out her objections on the boy.\n“Not especially.” He returned her gaze without flinching. “I think of him as someone else. Interesting, though.”\n“Someone else,” Bellonda muttered. She looked at Odrade with ill-concealed disagreement. “You're giving him the deep teaching!”\n“As his birth-mother did.”\n“Will | remember her?” Teg asked.\nOdrade gave him a conspiratorial smile, one they had Shared often in their orchard walks. “You will.”\n“Everything?”\n“You'll remember all of it—your wife, your children, the battles. Everything.”\n“Send him away!” Bellonda said.\nThe boy smiled but looked to Odrade, awaiting her command.\n“Very well, Miles,” Odrade said. “Tell Streggi to take you to your new quarters in the no-ship. l'II come along later and introduce you to Duncan.”\n“May I ride on Streggi’s shoulders?”\n“Ask her.”\nImpulsively, Teg dashed up to Odrade, lifted himself onto his toes and kissed her cheek. “I hope my real mother was like you.”\nOdrade patted his shoulder. “Very much like me. Run along now.”\nWhen the door closed behind him, Tamalane said: “You haven't told him you’re one of his daughters!”\n“Not yet.”\n“Will Idaho tell him?”\n“If it’s indicated.”\nBellonda was not interested in petty details. “What are you planning, Dar?”\nTamalane answered for her. “A punishment force commanded by our Mentat Bashar. It’s obvious.”\nShe took the bait!\n“Is that it?” Bellonda demanded.\nOdrade favored them both with a hard stare. “Teg was the best we ever had. If anyone can punish our enemies .. .”\n“We'd better start growing another one,” Tamalane said.\n“I don’t like the influence Murbella may have on him,” Bellonda said.\n“Will Idaho cooperate?” Tamalane asked.\n“He will do what an Atreides asks of him.”\nOdrade spoke with more confidence than she felt but the words opened her mind to another source of the alien feelings.\nI’m seeing us as Murbella sees us! I can think like at least one Honored Matre!\nWe do not teach history; we recreate the experience. We follow the chain of consequences—the tracks of the beast in its forest. Look behind our words and you see the broad sweep of social behavior that no historian has ever touched.\n—BENE GESSERIT PANOPLIA PROPHETICUS\nS cytale whistled while he walked down the corridor fronting his quarters, taking his afternoon exercise. Down and back. Whistling.\nGet them accustomed to me whistling.\nAs he whistled, he composed a ditty to go with the sound: “Tleilaxu sperm does not talk.” Over and over, the words rolled in his mind. They could not use his cells to bridge the genetic gap and learn his secrets.\nThey must come to me with gifts.\nOdrade had stopped by to see him earlier “on my way to confer with Murbella.” She mentioned the captive Honored Matre to him frequently. There was a purpose but he had no idea what it might be. Threat? Always possible. It would be revealed eventually.\n“| hope you are not fearful,” Odrade had said.\nThey had been standing at his food slot while he waited for lunch to appear. The menu was never quite to his liking but acceptable. Today, he had asked for seafood. No telling what form it would take.\n“Fearful? Of you? Ahhh, dear Mother Superior, | am priceless to you alive. Why should | fear?”\n“My Council reserves judgment on your latest requests.”\n| expected that.\n“It’s a mistake to hobble me,” he said. “Limits your choices. Weakens you.”\nThose words had taken several days of planning for him to compose. He waited for their effect.\n“It depends on how one intends to employ the tool, Master Scytale. Some tools break when you don’t use them properly.”\nDamn you, witch!\nHe smiled, showing his sharp canines. “Testing to extinction, Mother Superior?”\nShe made one of her rare sallies into humor. “Do you really expect me to strengthen you? For what do you bargain now, Scytale?”\nSo I’m no longer Master Scytale. Strike her with the flat of the blade!\n“You Scatter your Sisters, hoping some will escape destruction. What are the economic consequences of your hysterical reaction?”\nConsequences! They always talk about consequences.\n“We trade for time, Scytale.” Very solemn.\nHe gave this a silent moment of reflection. The comeyes were watching them. Never forget it! Economics, witch! Who and what do we buy and sell? This alcove by the food slot was a Strange place for bargaining, he thought. Bad management of the economy. The management hustle, the planning and strategy session, should occur behind closed doors, in high rooms with views that did not distract the occupants from the business at hand.\nThe serial memories of his many lives would not accept that. Necessity. Humans conduct their merchant affairs wherever they can—on the decks of sailing ships, in tawdry streets full of bustling clerks, in the spacious halls of a traditional bourse with information flowing above their heads for all to see.\nPlanning and strategy might come from those high rooms but the evidence of it was like the common information of the bourse—there for all to see.\nSo let the comeyes watch.\n“What are your intentions toward me, Mother Superior?”\n“To keep you alive and strong.”\nCareful, careful.\n“But not give me a free hand.”\n“Scytale! You speak of economics and then want something free?”\n“But my strength is important to you?”\n“Believe it!”\n“| do not trust you.”\nThe food slot took that moment to disgorge his lunch: a white fish sauteed in a delicate sauce. He smelled herbs. Water in a tall glass, faint aroma of melange. A green salad. One of their better efforts. He felt himself salivating.\n“Enjoy your lunch, Master Scytale. There is nothing in it to harm you. Is that not a measure of trust?”\nWhen he did not respond, she said: “What does trust have to do with our bargaining?”\nWhat game is she playing now?\n“You tell me what you intend for Honored Matres but you do not say what you intend for me.” He knew he sounded plaintive. Unavoidable.\n“I intend to make the Honored Matres aware of their mortality.”\n“As you do with me!”\nWas that satisfaction in her eyes?\n“Scytale.” How soft her voice. “People thus made aware truly listen. They hear you.” She glanced at his tray. “Would you like something special?”\nHe drew himself up as best he could. “A small stimulant drink. It helps when I must think.”\n“Of course. l'Il see that it’s sent down at once.” She turned her attention out of the alcove toward the main room of his quarters. He watched where she paused, her gaze Shifting from place to place, item to item.\nEverything in its place, witch. | am not an animal in its cave. Things must be convenient, where | can find them\nwithout thinking. Yes, those are stimpens beside my chair. So I use ‘pens. But I avoid alcohol. You notice?\nThe stimulant, when it came, tasted of a bitter herb he was a moment identifying. Casmine. A genetically modified blood strengthener from the Gammu pharmacopoeia.\nDid she intend to remind him of Gammu? They were so devious, these witches!\nPoking fun at him over the question of economics. He felt the sting of this as he turned at the end of his corridor and continued his exercise in a brisk walk back to his quarters. What glue had actually held the Old Empire together? Many things, some small and some large, but mostly economic. Lines of connection thought of often as conveniences. And what kept them from blasting one another out of existence? The Great Convention. “You blast anyone and we unite to blast you.”\nHe stopped outside his door, brought up short by a thought.\nWas that it? How could punishment be enough to stop the greedy powindah? Did it come down to a glue composed of intangibles? The censure of your peers? But what if your peers balked at no obscenity? You could do anything. And that said something about Honored Matres. It certainly did.\nHe longed for a sagra chamber in which to bare his soul.\nThe Yaghist is gone! Am | the last Masheikh?\nHis chest felt empty. It was an effort to breathe. Perhaps it would be best to bargain more openly with the women of Shaitan.\nNo! That is Shaitan himself tempting me!\nHe entered his chambers in a chastened mood.\nI must make them pay. Make them pay dearly. Dearly, dearly, dearly. Each dearly accompanied a step toward his chair. When he sat, his right hand reached out automatically for a ’pen. Soon, he felt his mind driving at speed, thoughts pouring through in marvelous array.\nThey do not guess how well I know the Ixian ship. It’s here in my head.\nHe spent the next hour deciding how he would record these moments when it came time to tell his fellows how he had triumphed over the powindah. With God’s help!\nThey would be glittering words, filled with drama and the tensions of his testing. History, after all, was always written by the victors.\nThey say Mother Superior can disregard nothing—a meaningless aphorism until you grasp its other significance: | am the servant of all my Sisters. They watch their servant with critical eyes. | cannot spend too much time on generalities nor on trivia. Mother Superior must display insightful action else a sense of disquiet penetrates to the farthest corners of our order.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nS omething of what Odrade called “my servant-self” went with her as she walked the halls of Central this morning, making this her exercise rather than take time on a practice floor. A disgruntled servant! She did not like what she saw.\nWe are too tightly bound up in our difficulties, almost incapable of separating petty problems from great ones.\nWhat had happened to their conscience?\nAlthough some denied it, Odrade knew there was a Bene Gesserit conscience. But they had twisted and reshaped it into a form not easily recognized.\nShe felt loath to meddle with it. Decisions taken in the name of survival, the Missionaria (their interminable Jesuitical arguments!)—all diverged from something far more demanding of human judgment. The Tyrant had known this.\nTo be human, that was the issue. But before you could be human, you had to feel it in your guts.\nNo clinical answers! It came down to a deceptive Simplicity whose complex nature appeared when you applied it.\nLike me.\nYou looked inward and found who and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5354a3f5eb6a02d834bcfcb56424393354727ada3207268790513b8208970bc2_v2"}
