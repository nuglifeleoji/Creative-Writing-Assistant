Lü Bu's actions are significantly influenced by Yuan Shu's ambitions and strategies, particularly during their interactions amidst the chaos of war. After the siege of Chang'an, Lü Bu finds himself in a precarious position and flees to Yuan Shu seeking refuge. This act of seeking sanctuary indicates a complex relationship between the two, as Lü Bu is simultaneously in direct conflict with Yuan Shu, aiming to defeat him in battle.\n\nYuan Shu, however, is angered by Lü Bu's actions, which complicates their relationship further.
