It was a revolution that had been dampened only in the time of the Tyrant, Leto Il.\nDampened, but not diverted or stopped, Odrade reminded herself.\n“In what you’re about to do,” Taraza said, “tell me if you sense any immediate threat to the Sisterhood.”\nIt was one of Taraza’s peculiar demands, which Odrade had learned to answer out of wordless instinct, which then could be formed into words. Quickly, she said: “If we fail to act, that is worse.”\n“We reasoned that there would be danger,” Taraza said. She spoke in a dry, remote voice. Taraza did not like calling up this talent in Odrade. The younger woman possessed a prescient instinct for detecting threats to the Sisterhood. It came from the wild influence in her genetic line, of course— the Atreides with their dangerous talents. There was a special mark on Odrade’s breeding file: “Careful examination of all offspring.” Two of those offspring had been quietly put to death.\n| should not have awakened Odrade’s talent now, not even for a moment, Taraza thought. But sometimes temptation was very great.\nTaraza sealed the projector into her tabletop and looked at the blank surface while speaking. “Even if you find a perfect sire, you are not to breed without our permission while you are away from us.”\n“The mistake of my natural mother,” Odrade said.\n“The mistake of your natural mother was to be recognized while she was breeding!”\nOdrade had heard this before. There was that thing about the Atreides line that required the most careful monitoring by the breeding mistresses. The wild talent, of course. She knew about the wild talent, that genetic force which had produced the Kwisatz Haderach and the Tyrant. What did the breeding mistresses seek now, though? Was their approach mostly negative? No more dangerous births! She had never seen any of her babies after they were born, not necessarily a curious thing for the Sisterhood. And she never saw any of the records in her own genetic file. Here, too, the Sisterhood operated with careful separation of powers.\nAnd those earlier prohibitions on my Other Memories!\nShe had found the blank spaces in her memories and opened them. It was probable that only Taraza and perhaps two other councillors (Bellonda, most likely, and one other\nolder Reverend Mother) shared the more sensitive access to such breeding information.\nHad Taraza and the other really sworn to die before revealing privileged information to an outsider? There was, after all, a precise ritual of succession should a key Reverend Mother die while away from her Sisters and with no chance to pass along her encapsulated lives. The ritual had been called into play many times during the reign of the Tyrant. A terrible period! Knowing that the revolutionary cells of the Sisterhood were transparent to him! Monster! She knew that her sisters had never deluded themselves that Leto Il refrained from destroying the Bene Gesserit out of some deep-seated loyalty to his grandmother, the Lady Jessica.\nAre you there, Jessica?\nOdrade felt the stirring far within. The failure of one Reverend Mother: “She allowed herself to fall in love!” Such a small thing but how great the consequences. Thirty-five hundred years of tyranny!\nThe Golden Path. Infinite? What of the lost megatrillions gone into the Scattering? What threat was posed by those Lost Ones returning now?\nAs though she read Odrade’s mind, which sometimes she appeared to do, Taraza said: “The Scattered ones are out there ... just waiting to pounce.”\nOdrade had heard the arguments: Danger on the one hand and on the other, something magnetically attractive. So many magnificent unknowns. The Sisterhood with its talents honed by melange over the millennia—what might they not do with such untapped resources of humanity? Think of the uncounted genes out there! Think of the potential talents floating free in universes where they might be lost forever!\n“It’s the not knowing that conjures up the greatest terrors,” Odrade said.\n“And the greatest ambitions,” Taraza said.\n“Then do | go to Rakis?”\n“In due course. | find you adequate to the task.”\n“Or you would not have assigned me.”\nIt was an old exchange between them, going right back to their school days. Taraza realized, though, that she had not entered it consciously. Too many memories tangled the two of them: Dar and Tar. Have to watch that!\n“Remember where your loyalties are,” Taraza said.\nThe existence of no-ships raises the possibility of destroying entire planets without retaliation. A large object, asteroid or equivalent, may be sent against the planet. Or the people can be set against each other by sexual subversion, and then can be armed to destroy themselves. These Honored Matres appear to favor this latter technique.\n—BENE GESSERIT ANALYSIS\nF rom his position in the courtyard and even when not appearing to do so, Duncan Idaho kept his attention on the observers above him. There was Patrin, of course, but Patrin did not count. It was the Reverend Mothers across from Patrin who bore watching. Seeing Lucilla, he thought: That’s the new one. This thought filled him with a surge of excitement, which he took out in renewed exercise.\nHe completed the first three patterns of the training-play Miles Teg had ordered, vaguely aware that Patrin would report on how well he did. Duncan liked Teg and old Patrin and sensed that the feeling was reciprocated. This new Reverend Mother, though—her presence suggested interesting changes. For one thing, she was younger than the others. Also, this new one did not try to hide the eyes that were a first clue to her membership in the Bene Gesserit. His first glimpse of Schwangyu had confronted him with eyes concealed behind contact lenses that simulated non-addict pupils and slightly bloodshot whites. He had heard one of the Keep’s acolytes say Schwangyu’s lenses also corrected for “an astigmatic weakness that has been accepted in her genetic line as a reasonable exchange for the other qualities she transmits to her offspring.”\nAt the time, most of this remark was unintelligible to Duncan but he had looked up the references in the Keep’s\nlibrary, references both scarce and severely limited in content. Schwangyu herself parried all of his questions on the subject, but the subsequent behavior of his teachers told him she had been angry. Typically, she had taken out her anger on others.\nWhat really upset her, he suspected, was his demand to know whether she was his mother.\nFor a long time now Duncan had known he was something special. There were places in the elaborate compound of this Bene Gesserit Keep where he was not permitted. He had found private ways to evade such prohibitions and had stared out often through thick plaz and open windows at guards and wide reaches of cleared ground that could be enfiladed from strategically positioned pillboxes. Miles Teg himself had taught the significance of enfilade positioning.\nGammu, the planet was called now. Once, it had been known as Giedi Prime but someone named Gurney Halleck had changed that. It was all ancient history. Dull stuff. There still remained a faint smell of bitter oil in the planet’s dirt from its pre-Danian days. Millennia of special plantations were changing that, his teachers explained. He could see part of this from the Keep. Forests of conifers and other trees surrounded them here.\nStill covertly watching the two Reverend Mothers, Duncan did a series of cartwheels. He flexed his striking muscles as he moved, just the way Teg had taught him.\nTeg also instructed in planetary defenses. Gammu was ringed by orbiting monitors whose crews could not have their families aboard. The families remained down here on Gammu, hostage to the vigilance of those guardian orbiters. Somewhere among the ships in space, there were undetectable no-ships whose crews were composed entirely of the Bashar’s people and Bene Gesserit Sisters.\n“I would not have taken this assignment without full charge of all defensive arrangements,” Teg explained.\nDuncan realized that he was “this assignment.” The Keep was here to protect him. Teg’s orbiting monitors, including the no-ships, protected the Keep.\nIt was all part of a military education whose elements Duncan found somehow familiar. Learning how to defend a seemingly vulnerable planet from attacks originating in Space, he knew when those defenses were correctly placed. It was extremely complicated as a whole but the elements were identifiable and could be understood. There was, for instance, the constant monitoring of atmosphere and the blood serum of Gammu’s inhabitants. Suk doctors in the pay of the Bene Gesserit were everywhere.\n“Diseases are weapons,” Teg said. “Our defense against diseases must be finely tuned.”\nFrequently, Teg railed against passive defenses. He called them “the product of a siege mentality long known to create deadly weaknesses.”\nWhen it came to military instructions from Teg, Duncan listened carefully. Patrin and the library records confirmed that the Mentat Bashar Miles Teg had been a famous military leader for the Bene Gesserit. Patrin often referred to their service together and always Teg was the hero.\n“Mobility is the key to military success,” Teg said. “If you're tied down in forts, even whole-planet forts, you are ultimately vulnerable.”\nTeg did not much care for Gammu.\n“I see that you already know this place was called Giedi Prime once. The Harkonnens who ruled here taught us a few things. We have a better idea, thanks to them, of how terrifyingly brutal humans can become.”\nAs he recalled this, Duncan observed that the two Reverend Mothers watching from the parapet obviously were discussing him.\nAm I the new one’s assignment?\nDuncan did not like being watched and he hoped the new one would allow him some time to himself. She did not look\nlike a tough one. Not like Schwangyu.\nAs he continued his exercises, Duncan timed them to a private litany: Damn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!\nHe had hated Schwangyu from the age of nine—four years now. She did not know his hate, he thought. She had probably forgotten all about the incident where his hate had been ignited.\nBarely nine and he had managed to slip through the inner guards out into a tunnel that led to one of the pillboxes. Smell of fungus in the tunnel. Dim lights. Dampness. He peered out through the box’s weapons slits before being caught and hustled back into the core of the Keep.\nThis escapade occasioned a stern lecture from Schwangyu, a remote and threatening figure whose orders must be obeyed. That was how he still thought of her, although he had since learned about the Bene Gesserit Voice-of-Command, that vocal subtlety which could bend the will of an untrained listener.\nShe must be obeyed.\n“You have occasioned the disciplining of an entire guard unit,” Schwangyu said. “They will be severely punished.”\nThat had been the most terrible part of her lecture. Duncan liked some of the guards and occasionally lured some of them into real play with laughter and tumbling. His prank, sneaking out to the pillbox, had hurt his friends.\nDuncan knew what it was to be punished.\nDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\nAfter Schwangyu’s lecture, Duncan ran to his chief instructor of the moment, Reverend Mother Tamalane, another of the wizened old ones with a cool and aloof manner, snowy hair above a narrow face and a leather skin. He demanded of Tamalane to know about the punishment of his guards. Tamalane fell into a surprising pensive mood, her voice like\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced genetic breeding programs and political influence>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LETO IL<|>PERSON<|>Leto Il, also known as the Tyrant, was a despotic ruler who oppressed the Bene Gesserit and others during his 3,500-year reign>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit with prescient instincts and a connection to the Atreides genetic line>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is a senior Reverend Mother and leader within the Bene Gesserit, overseeing breeding programs and strategic decisions>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit councillor with access to sensitive breeding information>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Lady Jessica was the grandmother of Leto Il and a key figure in Bene Gesserit history>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a special individual under the protection of the Bene Gesserit, trained in military tactics and closely monitored>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is a Mentat Bashar and military leader who trains Duncan Idaho in defense strategies>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Patrin is an associate of Miles Teg and assists in Duncan Idaho's training>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a young Reverend Mother assigned to observe Duncan Idaho>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Schwangyu is a strict Reverend Mother who has clashed with Duncan Idaho>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Tamalane is a Reverend Mother and instructor involved in Duncan Idaho's education>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu, formerly Giedi Prime, is a planet with a dark history, now heavily defended by the Bene Gesserit>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is a planet of strategic importance to the Bene Gesserit>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>The Scattering refers to a mass exodus of humanity into uncharted space, with some now returning as potential threats>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is a long-term survival strategy initiated by Leto Il, with uncertain outcomes>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother serving the Bene Gesserit's interests<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is a high-ranking leader within the Bene Gesserit<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TARAZA<|>Odrade and Taraza share a long history and collaborate on Bene Gesserit missions<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>LETO IL<|>Odrade reflects on the oppressive reign of Leto Il and his impact on the Bene Gesserit<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>LETO IL<|>Taraza acknowledges Leto Il's tyranny and its consequences for the Bene Gesserit<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MILES TEG<|>Duncan Idaho is trained in military tactics by Miles Teg<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan Idaho is a special project under the protection and observation of the Bene Gesserit<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SCHWANGYU<|>Duncan Idaho harbors deep resentment toward Schwangyu for her harsh treatment<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LUCILA<|>Lucilla is assigned to observe Duncan Idaho, suggesting a new phase in his training<|>4>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Miles Teg serves as a military leader for the Bene Gesserit<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GAMMU<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Gammu is a heavily defended planet under Bene Gesserit control<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCATTERING<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Scattering poses both threats and opportunities for the Bene Gesserit<|>6>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
