个龟子孙，他也不在乎。他现在什么也不顾，只顾跑烂鞋地张这宗“喜事”。他会拖拉着烂鞋，一时三刻就趟过东拉河，兴奋地出现在金俊山的院子里……“狗改不了吃屎！”田福堂在心里骂孙玉亭。 \n　　但说来奇怪，田福堂虽然不愿去出席孙少安的“点火仪式”，并且把孙玉亭臭骂了一通，但他对玉亭来请他去代表双水村“致词”这一点，倒还满意。 \n　　哼，不管怎说，我田福堂还是村里的首要人物！这号事，不管你们情不情愿，还得来请我。我不去才轮你金俊山哩！甭看你金俊山成了双水村的“总理”，任何时候都是共产党领导一切！孙悟空一个筋斗十万八千里，也翻不出如来佛掌，甭看你们…… \n　　一阵猛烈的咳嗽打断了他的思索——正是因为内心活动过于激烈，才使这次咳嗽提前到来了。 \n　　田福堂把一堆粘痰和鼻涕甩在旁边的地上，呻吟着重新躺进破碾盘的凹槽里。唉，心强命不强呀！要是家里不出这么多灾害，他的身体也许不至于垮下来，那双水村这阵儿头一个红火人说不定还是他田福堂。孙少安办了个砖场？他田福堂就办个铁厂让你们瞧瞧！ \n　　不过，从内心说，他对孙玉厚的大小子还是佩服的。这小子气魄就是不小！敢到银行贷万把块钱，还雇用了村中几十号人马，弄起了砖场。现在，又请来县长，雷鸣击鼓搞什么“点火仪式”。田福堂承认，在农村，这孙少安就是个人才。他由此也自然想起了当年少安和润叶的那些“瓜葛”。唉，现在这小子扬眉吐气，前后沟踩得地皮响；而他可怜的女儿却和一个残废人生活在一起……对于少安和润叶最终没有成亲，田福堂即是现在也无半点懊悔之意。女儿的不幸是另一回事，而决不是说她没有和孙玉厚的儿子结婚！孙少安再飞黄腾达，也是个泥腿把子。他有文化的女儿应该找个吃官饭的丈夫——当然不是缺胳膊少腿的！ \n　　眼下，他对孙少安最大的心病倒不在于他“发财”，而是他强烈地意识到，双水村的公众逐渐被这小子吸引过去了。孙少安现在尽管连个党员也不是，但几乎已经成了村中的“领袖”。某一天，双水村的“权力”是否要落入这家伙的手中？ \n　　田福堂虽然已不再热心双水村的公众事务，农村的“官”现在也没什么权力，但他只要还在出气，就不准备把党支部书记的职务交给别人。 \n　　对田福堂这样\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂 is a prominent figure in 双水村, feeling threatened by the rising
