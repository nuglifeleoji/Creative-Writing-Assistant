They’d obviously given up on Ghanima. Perhaps they sympathized with her. Angrily, Alia sent them from the room. Relief was obvious on their faces as they obeyed.\n“You run,” Ghanima persisted.\n“I’ve chosen a way of life which suits me,” Alia said, turning back to stare at Ghanima sitting cross-legged on the cot. Was it possible she’d made that terrible inner compromise? Alia tried to see the signs of it in Ghanima, but was unable to read a single betrayal. Alia wondered then: Has she seen it in me? But how could she?\n“You feared to be the window for a multitude,” Ghanima accused. “But we're the pre-born and we know. You'll be their window, conscious or unconscious. You cannot deny them.” And she thought: Yes, I know you—Abomination. And perhaps I'll go as you have gone, but for now I can only pity you and despise you.\nSilence hung between Ghanima and Alia, an almost palpable thing which alerted the Bene Gesserit training in lrulan. She glanced from one to the other, then: “Why’re you so quiet suddenly?”\n“I’ve just had a thought which requires considerable reflection,” Alia said.\n“Reflect at your leisure, dear aunt,” Ghanima sneered.\nAlia, putting down fatigue-inflamed anger, said: “Enough for now! Leave her to think. Perhaps she’ll come to her senses.”\nlrulan arose, said: “It’s almost dawn anyway. Ghani, before we go, would you care to hear the latest message from Farad’n? He...”\n“I would not,” Ghanima said. “And hereafter, cease calling me by that ridiculous diminutive. Ghani! It merely supports the mistaken assumption that I’m a child you can...”\n“Why'd you and Alia grow so suddenly quiet?” Irulan asked, reverting to her previous question, but casting it now in a delicate mode of Voice.\nGhanima threw her head back in laughter. “Irulan! You’d try Voice on me?”\n“What?” Irulan was taken aback.\n“You'd teach your grandmother to suck eggs,” Ghanima said.\n“I'd what?”\n“The fact that | remember the expression and you've never even heard it before should give you pause,” Ghanima said. “It was an old expression of scorn when you Bene Gesserit were young. But if that doesn’t chasten you, ask yourself what your royal parents could’ve been thinking of when they named you Irulan? Or is it Ruinal?”\nIn spite of her training, Irulan flushed. “You're trying to goad me, Ghanima.”\n“And you tried to use Voice on me. On me! | remember the first human efforts in that direction. | remember then, Ruinous Irulan. Now, get out of here, all of you.”\nBut Alia was intrigued now, caught by an inner suggestion which sluffed her fatigue aside. She said: “Perhaps I’ve a suggestion which could change your mind, Ghani.”\n“Still Ghani!” A brittle laugh escaped Ghanima, then: “Reflect but a moment: If | desire to kill Farad’n, | need but fall in with your plans. | presume you've thought of that. Beware of Ghani in a tractable mood. You see, I’m being utterly candid with you.”\n“That’s what | hoped,” Alia said. “If you...”\n“The blood of a brother cannot be washed away,” Ghanima said. “l'Il not go before my Fremen loved ones a traitor to that. Never to forgive, never to forget. Isn't that our catechism? | warn you here, and I'll say it publicly: you cannot betroth me to Farad’n. Who, knowing me, would believe it? Farad’n himself could not believe it. Fremen,\nhearing of such a betrothal, would laugh into their sleeves and say, ‘See! She lures him into a trap.’ If you...”\n“I understand that,” Alia said, moving to Irulan’s side. lrulan, she noted, was standing in shocked silence, aware already of where this conversation was headed.\n“And so | would be luring him into a trap,” Ghanima said. “If that’s what you want, l'Il agree, but he may not fall. If you wish this false betrothal as the empty coin with which to buy back my grandmother and your precious Duncan, so be it. But it’s on your head. Buy them back. Farad’n, though, is mine. Him lII kill.”\nlrulan whirled to face Alia before she could speak. “Alia! If we go back on our word .. .” She let it hang there a moment while Alia smilingly reflected on the potential wrath among the Great Houses in Faufreluches Assembled, the destructive consequences to believe in Atreides honor, the loss of religious trust, all of the great and small building blocs which would tumble.\n“Itd rule against us,” Irulan protested. “All belief in Paul’s prophethood would be destroyed. It...the Empire...”\n“Who could dare question our right to decide what is wrong and what is right?” Alia asked, voice mild. “We mediate between good and evil. | need but proclaim...”\n“You can’t do this!” Irulan protested. “Paul’s memory .. .”\n“Is just another tool of Church and State,” Ghanima said. “Don’t speak foolishness, Irulan.” Ghanima touched the crysknife at her waist, looked up at Alia. “I’ve misjudged my clever aunt, Regent of all that’s Holy in Muad’Dib’s Empire. | have, indeed, misjudged you. Lure Farad’n into our parlor if you will.”\n“This is recklessness,” Irulan pleaded.\n“You agree to this betrothal, Ghanima?” Alia asked, ignoring Irulan.\n“On my terms,” Ghanima said, hand still on her crysknife.\n“I wash my hands of this,” Irulan said, actually wringing her hands. “I was willing to argue for a true betrothal to heal\n\"m\n“We'll give you a wound much more difficult to heal, Alia and |,” Ghanima said. “Bring him quickly, if he’ll come. And perhaps he will. Would he suspect a child of my tender years? Let us plan the formal ceremony of betrothal to require his presence. Let there be an opportunity for me to be alone with him... just a minute or two...”\nlrulan shuddered at this evidence that Ghanima was, after all, Fremen entire, child no different from adult in this terrible bloodiness. After all, Fremen children were accustomed to slay the wounded on the battlefield, releasing women from this chore that they might collect the bodies and haul them away to the deathstills. And Ghanima, speaking with the voice of a Fremen child, piled horror upon horror by the studied maturity of her words, by the ancient sense of vendetta which hung like an aura around her.\n“Done,” Alia said, and she fought to keep voice and face from betraying her glee. “We’ll prepare the formal charter of betrothal. We’ll have the signatures witnessed by the proper assemblage from the Great Houses. Farad’n cannot possibly doubt—”\n“He'll doubt, but he’ll come,” Ghanima said. “And he'll have guards. But will they think to guard him from me?”\n“For the love of all that Paul tried to do,” Irulan protested, “let us at least make Farad’n’s death appear an accident, or the result of malice by outside—”\n“I'll take joy in displaying my bloody knife to my brethren,” Ghanima said.\n“Alia, | beg you,” Irulan said. “Abandon this rash insanity. Declare kanly against Farad’n, anything to—”\n“We don’t require formal declaration of vendetta against him,” Ghanima said. “The whole Empire knows how we must feel.” She pointed to the sleeve of her robe. “We wear the yellow of mourning. When | exchange it for the black of a Fremen betrothed, will that fool anyone?”\n“Pray that it fools Farad’n,” Alia said, “and the delegates of the Great Houses we invite to witness the—”\n“Every one of those delegates will turn against you,” lrulan said. “You know that!”\n“Excellent point,” Ghanima said. “Choose those delegates with care, Alia. They must be ones we won’t mind eliminating later.”\nlrulan threw up her arms in despair, turned and fled.\n“Have her put under close surveillance lest she try to warn her nephew,” Ghanima said.\n“Don’t try to teach me how to conduct a plot,” Alia said. She turned and followed Irulan, but at a slower pace. The guards outside and the waiting aides were sucked up in her wake like sand particles drawn into the vortex of a rising worm.\nGhanima shook her head sadly from side to side as the door closed, thought: /t’s as poor Leto and I thought. Gods below! | wish it'd been me the tiger killed instead of him.\nMany forces sought control of the Atreides twins and, when the death of Leto was announced, this movement of plot and counterplot was amplified. Note the relative motivations: the Sisterhood feared Alia, an adult Abomination, but still wanted those genetic characteristics carried by the Atreides. The Church hierarchy of Augaf and Hajj saw only the power implicit in control of Muad’Dib’s heir. CHOAM wanted a doorway to the wealth of Dune. Farad’n and his Sardaukar sought a return to glory for House Corrino. The Spacing Guild feared the equation Arrakis = melange; without the spice they could not navigate. Jessica wished to repair what her disobedience to the Bene Gesserit had created. Few thought to ask the twins what their plans might be, until it was too late.\n—THE BOOK OF KREOS\nhortly after the evening meal, Leto saw a man walking\npast the arched doorway to his chamber, and his mind went with the man. The passage had been left open and Leto had seen some activity out there—spice hampers being wheeled past, three women with the obvious off-world sophistication of dress which marked them as smugglers. This man who took Leto’s mind walking might have been no different except that he moved like Stilgar, a much younger Stilgar.\nIt was a peculiar walk his mind took. Time filled Leto’s awareness like a stellar globe. He could see infinite timespaces, but he had to press into his own future before knowing in which moment his flesh lay. His multifaceted memory-lives surged and receded, but they were his now. They were like waves on a beach, but if they rose too high, he could command them and they would retreat, leaving the royal Harum behind.\nNow and again he would listen to those memory-lives. One would rise like a prompter, poking its head up out of the stage and calling cues for his behavior. His father came\nduring the mind-walk and said: “You are a child seeking to be a man. When you are a man, you will seek in vain for the child you were.”\nAll the while, he felt his body being plagued by the fleas and lice of an old sietch poorly maintained.
