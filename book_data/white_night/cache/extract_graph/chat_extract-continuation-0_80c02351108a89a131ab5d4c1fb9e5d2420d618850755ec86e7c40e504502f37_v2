要知道，两百点精神力可是精神力境界的一个重要分水岭。精神力达到两百点，虽然并不是进入下一个层次，却意味着从灵通境初阶进入到中阶。\n\n    蓝轩宇能不能一举突破?如果真的突破了，那可就……精神力达到临界点的时候，需要的是积累，然后再突破。很多魂师都会在临界点上卡很久。\n\n    哪怕这只是一个较低的境界，也是如此。虽然老师们都知道这一点，可是，眼前的一幕还是让他们热血沸腾，他们都期待着奇迹的出现。\n\n    终于，精神力数值在达到一百九十九的时候停了下来。老师们面面相觑。\n\n    一百九十九啊！虽然他们心中多少都有些遗憾，但仔细一想这个结果时，都不禁倒吸一口凉气。\n\n    这可是一百九十九点精神力啊！这是多少低阶魂师梦寐以求的?蓝轩宇才八岁多，不到九岁，其精神力竟然已经到了这种程度。最多再沉淀几个月，也就能够突破了。\n\n    老师们都知道蓝轩宇是双生武魂，按说，双生武魂的魂力修炼速度应该比较快才对，蓝轩宇的魂力却始终都提升得很慢。\n\n    可魂力提升得慢，似乎让他的精神力提升速度更快了。\n\n    他们哪里知道，蓝轩宇这精神力提升的过程全都是血泪啊！每天晚上在银天凡的模拟舱里感受星际战机的恐怖速度，在那种情况下，不集中精神就要狂吐。\n\n    这种恐怖的锻炼精神力的方法，估计没有人会想要尝试。蓝轩宇撑过来了，总要有点收获。\n\n    此时此刻，正在进行精神力测试的蓝轩宇却是另一种感受，他只觉得自己的大脑一片空明。\n\n    精神力五十点以下是灵元境，一元初始，万象更新。而到了五十点以上，就进入到了灵通境，心神通灵，意达念至。要到五百点以上，才会进入到下一个大层次——灵海境。\n\n    从灵通境到灵海境，几乎是拦住了百分之九十以上魂师的门槛。其中，两百点和三百五十点精神力，是划分灵通境初阶、中阶和高阶的两个分水岭。\n\n    像蓝轩宇的妈妈南澄，六环修为，精神力现在也只是勉强到了灵海境。蓝轩宇只觉得自己心静如水，脑海中仿佛回荡着一个个声音，他能清晰地看到自己胸口内那旋转着的金银双色旋涡在不停地律动，有节奏地变化，甚至连核心处那一个彩色光点都能看得更加清楚了。\n\n    他现在能够从中辨别出三四种颜色了。\n\n    他下意识地凝\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
