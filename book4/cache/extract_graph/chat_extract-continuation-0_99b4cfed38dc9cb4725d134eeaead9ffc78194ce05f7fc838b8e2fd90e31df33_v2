\n　　苗凯也能理解秘书的心情。小伙歪好侍候他几年了，总得提拔一下。再说，又是个大学生——现在当官不就是讲究有文凭吗？ \n　　但他有点气恼的是，秘书这时候提出这问题。几乎等于公然地把他看成个已经大势已去的老汉了。他由此进而推想，大概黄原地区的所有干部现在都这样看他苗凯。 \n　　尽管他对白元此时提出要去“锻炼”不愉快，但还是忍着没有表示出来。他盘腿坐在沙发里，和气地问秘书：“那你想到什么地方去呢？” \n　　白元突然变得象个十八岁的害羞姑娘，两只手互相搓着，先咧开嘴不好意思地笑了笑，说：“我想下到县里去。”“想去哪个县？” \n　　“如果可以的话，我想到原南县去。” \n　　哼，倒会挑地方！原南是黄原最好的县，不光产煤，还有一片森林，粮食和钱都不缺。工作很容易搞出成绩。地区有几个领导都是在原南县提拔上来的。黄原的干部说那是个出专员书记的地方。哼，一口倒想吃个白菜心！那你下去想干什么工作有考虑吗？”苗凯问一脸羞涩的秘书。 \n　　“如果县委副书记不好安排，那我就当个县革委会副主任，但最好能挂个县委常委……”白元毫不害羞地说。 \n　　苗凯瞪大眼半天说不出话来了。他的秘书竟然不要脸地向他直截了当要这么重要的职务！ \n　　这倒使苗凯一时产生了一种愤慨的情绪。他想他如果还回黄原工作，他就不要专职秘书了；自己要走哪里，办公室随便叫个人跟上就行了。白元他不要了，原南县的官他也当不成！叫这小子到哪个部门当个副科长就满行了！这种野心家还敢提拔！ \n　　他把吃剩的半个苹果搁在碟子里，仍然和气地对秘书说：“你的想法我知道了，罢了再说吧……” \n　　这时候，办事处主任武宏全进来请他们去吃午饭。苗凯就和白元起身去小餐厅。 \n　　午饭是刀削面。办事处主任武宏全知道苗书记是山西人，还给他准备了一瓶清徐出的山西特别老陈醋。武宏全是地区劳动人事局副局长武得全的哥哥，是个门路广，会办事的人，多年来一直担任驻省办事处主任。 \n　　当天下午，省委常务副秘书长张生民带着省委两位副书记吴斌和石钟来办事处看他。 \n　　省委领导在他的套间里坐下后，张生民先对苗凯说：“本来省委乔书记也要来看你，但今天下午要坐飞机到中央去开会，走前专门吩咐我尽快给你在省医\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
