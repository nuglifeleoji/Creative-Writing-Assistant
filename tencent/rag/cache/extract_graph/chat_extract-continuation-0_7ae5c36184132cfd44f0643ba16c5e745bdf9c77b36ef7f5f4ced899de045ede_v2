They’ve marked out a trail in men’s lives.”\n“So?”\n“Another night comes,” Scytale said. “Winds blow.”\n“Yes,” Edric said, “the Jihad is finite. Muad’Dib has used his Jihad and—”\n“He didn’t use the Jihad,” Scytale said. “The Jihad used him. | think he would’ve stopped it if he could.”\n“If he could? All he had to do was—”\n“Oh, be still!” Scytale barked. “You can’t stop a mental epidemic. It leaps from person to person across parsecs. It’s overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad’Dib hasn’t the antidote. The thing has roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?”\n“Have you been infected, then?” Edric asked. He turned Slowly in the orange gas, wondering why Scytale’s words carried such a tone of fear. Had the Face Dancer broken from the conspiracy? There was no way to peer into the future and examine this now. The future had become a muddy stream, clogged with prophets.\n“We're all contaminated,” Scytale said, and he reminded himself that Edric’s intelligence had severe limits. How could this point be made that the Guildsman would understand it?\n“But when we destroy him,” Edric said, “the contag—”\n“I should leave you in this ignorance,” Scytale said. “But my duties will not permit it. Besides, it’s dangerous to all of us.”\nEdric recoiled, steadied himself with a kick of one webbed foot which sent the orange gas whipping around his legs. “You speak strangely,” he said.\n“This whole thing is explosive,” Scytale said in a calmer voice. “It’s ready to shatter. When it goes, it will send bits of itself out through the centuries. Don’t you see this?”\n“We've dealt with religions before,” Edric protested. “If this new—”\n“It is not just a religion!” Scytale said, wondering what the Reverend Mother would say to this harsh education of their fellow conspirator. “Religious government is something else. Muad’Dib has crowded his Qizarate in everywhere, displaced the old functions of government. But he has no permanent civil service, no interlocking embassies. He has bishoprics, islands of authority. At the center of each island is aman. Men learn how to gain and hold personal power. Men are jealous.”\n“When they’re divided, we'll absorb them one by one,” Edric said with a complacent smile. “Cut off the head and the body will fall to—”\n“This body has two heads,” Scytale said.\n“The sister—who may wed.”\n“Who will certainly wed.”\n“| don’t like your tone, Scytale.”\n“And | don’t like your ignorance.”\n“What if she does wed? Will that shake our plans?”\n“It will shake the universe.”\n“But they’re not unique. |, myself, possess powers which\n”\n“You're an infant. You toddle where they stride.”\n“They are not unique!”\n“You forget, Guildsman, that we once made a kwisatz haderach. This is a being filled by the spectacle of Time. It is a form of existence which cannot be threatened without enclosing yourself in the identical threat. Muad’Dib knows we would attack his Chani. We must move faster than we have. You must get to the ghola, prod him as | have instructed.”\n“And if | do not?”\n“We will feel the thunderbolt.”\nOh, worm of many teeth, Canst thou deny what has no cure? The flesh and breath which lure thee To the ground of all beginnings Feed on monsters twisting in a door of fire! Thou hast no robe in all thy attire To cover intoxications of divinity Or hide the burnings of desire!\n—WORMSONG FROM THE DUNEBOOK\npau! had worked up a sweat on the practice floor using crysknife and short sword against the ghola. He stood now at a window looking down into the temple plaza, tried to imagine the scene with Chani at the clinic. She’d been taken ill at midmorning, the sixth week of her pregnancy. The medics were the best. They’d call when they had news.\nMurky afternoon sandclouds darkened the sky over the plaza. Fremen called such weather “dirty air.”\nWould the medics never call? Each second struggled past, reluctant to enter his universe.\nWaiting... waiting .. . The Bene Gesserit sent no word from Wallach. Deliberately delaying, of course.\nPrescient vision had recorded these moments, but he shielded his awareness from the oracle, preferring the role here of a Timefish swimming not where he willed, but where the currents carried him. Destiny permitted no struggles now.\nThe ghola could be heard racking weapons, examining the equipment. Paul sighed, put a hand to his own belt, deactivated his shield. The tingling passage of its field ran down against his skin.\nHe’d face events when Chani came, Paul told himself. Time enough then to accept the fact that what he’d concealed from her had prolonged her life. Was it evil, he wondered, to prefer Chani to an heir? By what right did he make her choice for her? Foolish thoughts! Who could hesitate, given the alternatives—slave pits, torture,\nagonizing sorrow .. . and worse. He heard the door open, Chani’s footsteps. Paul turned.\nMurder sat on Chani’s face. The wide Fremen belt which gathered the waist of her golden robe, the water rings worn as a necklace, one hand at her hip (never far from the knife), the trenchant stare which was her first inspection of any room—everything about her stood now only as a background for violence.\nHe opened his arms as she came to him, gathered her close.\n“Someone,” she rasped, speaking against his breast, “has been feeding me a contraceptive for a long time. . . before | began the new diet. There’ll be problems with this birth because of it.”\n“But there are remedies?” he asked.\n“Dangerous remedies. | know the source of that poison! l'Il have her blood.”\n“My Sihaya,” he whispered, holding her close to calm a sudden trembling. “You'll bear the heir we want. Isn’t that enough?”\n“My life burns faster,” she said, pressing against him. “The birth now controls my life. The medics told me it goes at a terrible pace. | must eat and eat... and take more Spice, as well... eat it, drink it. l'II kill her for this!”\nPaul kissed her cheek. “No, my Sihaya. You'll kill no one.” And he thought: /rulan prolonged your life, beloved. For you, the time of birth is the time of death.\nHe felt hidden grief drain his marrow then, empty his life into a black flask.\nChani pushed away from him. “She cannot be forgiven!”\n“Who said anything about forgiving?”\n“Then why shouldn’t I kill her?”\nIt was such a flat, Fremen question that Paul felt himself almost overcome by a hysterical desire to laugh. He covered it by saying: “It wouldn’t help.”\n“You've seen that?”\nPaul felt his belly tighten with vision-memory.\n“What I’ve seen... what I’ve seen...” he muttered. Every aspect of surrounding events fitted a present which paralyzed him. He felt chained to a future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus. Tight dryness clogged his throat. Had he followed the witchcall of his own oracle, he wondered, until it’d spilled him into a merciless present?\n“Tell me what you've seen,” Chani said.\n“I can’t.”\n“Why mustn’t I kill her?”\n“Because | ask it.”\nHe watched her accept this. She did it the way sand accepted water: absorbing and concealing. Was there obedience beneath that hot, angry surface? he wondered. And he realized then that life in the royal Keep had left Chani unchanged. She’d merely stopped here for a time, inhabited a way station on a journey with her man. Nothing of the desert had been taken from her.\nChani stepped away from him then, glanced at the ghola who stood waiting near the diamond circle of the practice door.\n“You’ve been crossing blades with him?” she asked.\n“And I’m better for it.”\nHer gaze went to the circle on the floor, back to the ghola’s metallic eyes.\n“I don’t like it,” she said.\n“He’s not intended to do me violence,” Paul said.\n“You've seen that?”\n“I’ve not seen it!”\n“Then how do you know?”\n“Because he’s more than ghola; he’s Duncan Idaho.”\n“The Bene Tleilax made him.”\n“They made more than they intended.”\nShe shook her head. A corner of her nezhoni scarf rubbed the collar of her robe. “How can you change the fact that he is ghola?”\n“Hayt,” Paul said, “are you the tool of my undoing?”\n“If the substance of here and now is changed, the future is changed,” the ghola said.\n“That is no answer!” Chani objected.\nPaul raised his voice: “How will | die, Hayt?”\nLight glinted from the artificial eyes. “It is said, m’Lord, that you will die of money and power.”\nChani stiffened. “How dare he speak thus to you?”\n“The mentat is truthful,” Paul said.\n“Was Duncan Idaho a real friend?” she asked.\n“He gave his life for me.”\n“It is sad,” Chani whispered, “that a ghola cannot be restored to his original being.”\n“Would you convert me?” the ghola asked, directing his gaze to Chani.\n“What does he mean?” Chani asked.\n“To be converted is to be turned around,” Paul said. “But there’s no going back.”\n“Every man carries his own past with him,” Hayt said.\n“And every ghola?” Paul asked.\n“In a way, m’Lord.”\n“Then what of that past in your secret flesh?” Paul asked.\nChani saw how the question disturbed the ghola. His movements quickened, hands clenched into fists. She glanced at Paul, wondering why he probed thus. Was there a way to restore this creature to the man he’d been?\n“Has a ghola ever remembered his real past?” Chani asked.\n“Many attempts have been made,” Hayt said, his gaze fixed on the floor near his feet. “No ghola has ever been restored to his former being.”\n“But you long for this to happen,” Paul said.\nThe blank surfaces of the ghola’s eyes came up to center on Paul with a pressing intensity. “Yes!”\nVoice soft, Paul said: “If there’s a way...”\n“This flesh,” Hayt said, touching left hand to forehead ina curious saluting movement, “is not the flesh of my original birth. It is... reborn. Only the shape is familiar. A Face Dancer might do as well.”\n“Not as well,” Paul said. “And you’re not a Face Dancer.”\n“That is true, m’Lord.”\n“Whence comes your shape?”\n“The genetic imprint of the original cells.”\n“Somewhere,” Paul said, “there’s a plastic something which remembers the shape of Duncan Idaho. It’s said the ancients probed this region before the Butlerian Jihad. What’s the extent of this memory, Hayt? What did it learn from the original?”\nThe ghola shrugged.\n“What if he wasn’t Idaho?” Chani asked\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>A religious and political movement led by Muad'Dib, which has had a profound impact on the universe and its inhabitants.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>PERSON<|>The central figure of the Jihad, a powerful leader whose actions have shaped the course of history.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>A Face Dancer involved in a conspiracy against Muad'Dib, known for his intelligence and fear of the Jihad's consequences.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDRIC<|>PERSON<|>A Guildsman and conspirator against Muad'Dib, with limited understanding of the broader implications of their plans.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QIZARATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The religious government established by Muad'Dib, replacing traditional civil services with bishoprics.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with influence over political and religious affairs.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A desert-dwelling people known for their resilience and loyalty to Muad'Dib.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A faction known for their genetic engineering, including the creation of gholas.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAYT<|>PERSON<|>A ghola created by the Bene Tleilax, originally Duncan Idaho, now serving as a mentat and advisor.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Muad'Dib's beloved and a fierce Fremen warrior, currently pregnant with his heir.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A loyal friend of Muad'Dib who gave his life for him, now reborn as the ghola Hayt.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALLACH<|>GEO<|>A location associated with the Bene Gesserit, possibly a planet or stronghold.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>A prison in Tiruzia where hostages were held.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>JIHAD<|>Muad'Dib is the leader of the Jihad, which has used him as much as he has used it.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>EDRIC<|>Scytale and Edric are co-conspirators against Muad'Dib, though Scytale finds Edric's understanding limited.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>CHANI<|>Chani is Muad'Dib's beloved and the mother of his heir, with a deep emotional bond.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAYT<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Hayt is a ghola created from the genetic material of Duncan Idaho, retaining some of his memories and traits.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>HAYT<|>The Bene Tleilax created Hayt as a ghola, though he may be more than they intended.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>QIZARATE<|>Muad'Dib established the Qizarate as his religious government, replacing traditional structures.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANI<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Chani has been poisoned by the Bene Gesserit, leading to complications with her pregnancy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Bene Gesserit are conspiring against Muad'Dib, though their plans are complex and multifaceted.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Scytale is part of a conspiracy involving the Bene Gesserit, though his loyalty may be uncertain.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>FREMEN<|>The Fremen are Muad'Dib's loyal followers, integral to his rise to power.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
