一罐喂那小伙子喝，他发了疯似地喝着，很快把五桶饮料全喝完了。这时他似乎从可怕的高烧中缓过来一些，当小梦又递来一个装着桔汁饮料的塑料瓶时，他摇了摇头。\n　　“我要……”他沙哑地说。\n　　“你要什么？！”华华大声问。\n　　“我要……要……”\n　　“你要什么？！说呀，我们给你去找！”\n　　“……要……要死了。”年轻人用悲伤的眼睛看着地面，又缓缓地摇了摇头。\n　　“你们都是怎么？”小梦哭着问。\n　　年轻人把一支手吃力地抬起来，无力地向上指了一下。华华随着他的手头，只看见大厅挂着枝形吊灯的天花板。他呆呆地看着那个挂得高高的吊灯，突然明白了年轻人指的是天花板之上太空！\n　　“那颗新太阳？”\n　　年轻人点点头.\n　　小梦止住了抽泣，看着年轻人问：“那颗太阳把细菌带到地球上来了吗？”\n　　年轻人摇摇头，这时他甚至笑了一下。\n　　“射线！？”华华瞪圆了双眼。\n　　年轻人无力地点点头。\n　　小梦扑到华华怀中：“我要妈妈，我要回家！”\n　　“回家，我们回家……”华华喃喃地说。\n　　“对，回家，快回家吧。”年轻人看着这两个孩子说，然后就昏了过去。他双目紧闭，只有急促的呼吸声才表明他活着。\n　　两个孩子默默地看着那个年轻人，他身体内急剧升高的体温正一点点地焚烧着他的生命。孩子们能做的就是从周围的旅行包中再找来些饮料，堆放在他的周围，但他似乎不会再醒来了。华华和小梦离开了年轻人，向检票口跑去，并很快穿过侯车室的门跑到站台上。他们看到，一列列没有乘客的客车毫无生气地停在那里，站台上空空的，只是远远地看到有三具冒蒸汽的尸体，以及两个躺在那里不知是死是活的人。在一节客车车厢的车门处也躺着一个人，身体的一半在车门里，一半在外面。再向远处，有一两个摇摇晃晃走动的人，还有一个打着红灯的人扶着车厢在慢慢地移动。现在想坐火车回家是何等可笑。\n　　华华和小梦只好放弃了回家的念头，重新穿过充满死亡的候车大厅，来到站前广场上。\n　　在这里，他们那将要崩溃的精神稍微恢复了一些。外面的尸体虽然也很多，甚至比候车大厅中还多，但有更多活着的人。人们中有大约三分之一病情已发展到垂死的状态，三分之二则是刚发病不久，还能象正常一样行动。站前广场上的人聚了一大片，但大多数人都沉默着。有人两手不停地乱动，有人死命地揪着自己的头发，有人使劲地撕着领口，有人把香烟一根根从烟盒中\n######################\nOutput:",
