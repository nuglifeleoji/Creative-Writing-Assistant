There was Teg on Streggi’s shoulders. He took a moment to stare up at the façade confronting them about half a klick away. She chose a projection that looked where he looked. Motion behind windows there.\nWhere were the mysterious last-ditch weapons Honored Matres were supposed to possess?\nWhat will he do now?\nTeg had lost his Command Pod to a laser hit outside the main engagement area. The pod lay on its side behind him and he sat astride Streggi’s shoulders in a patch of screening bushes, some still smoldering. He had lost his comboard with the pod but retained the silvery horseshoe of his comlink, although it was crippled without the pod’s amplifiers. Communications specialists crouched nearby, jittering because they had lost close contact with the action.\nThe battle beyond the buildings grew louder. He heard hoarse shouts, the high hissing of burners and the lower buzz of large lasguns mingled with tinny zip-zips of hand weapons. Somewhere off there to his left was a thrum- thrum he recognized as heavy armor in trouble. A scraping sound with it, metal agony. Energy system damaged in that one. It was dragging itself over the ground, probably making a mess of the gardens.\nHaker, Teg’s personal aide, came dodging down the lane behind the Bashar.\nStreggi noticed him first and turned without warning, forcing Teg to look at the man. Haker, dark and muscular, with heavy eyebrows (sweat-dampened now) stopped directly in front of Teg and spoke before fully regaining his breath.\n“We have the last pockets bottled up, Bashar.”\nHaker raised his voice to override the battle sounds and a buzzing squawker over his left shoulder producing low conversations, battle urgency in clipped tones.\n“The far perimeter?” Teg demanded.\n“Mop up in half an hour, no more. You should get out of here, Bashar. Mother Superior warned us to keep you out of needless danger.”\nTeg gestured at his useless pod. “Why don’t! have a Communications backup?”\n“A big laze got both backups in the same burn as they were coming in.”\n“They were together?”\nHaker heard the anger. “Sir, they were...”\n“No important equipment is sent in together. l'II want to know who disobeyed orders.” The quiet voice from immature vocal cords carried more menace than a shout.\n“Yes, Bashar.” Strictly obedient and no sign from Haker that the mistake was his own.\nDamn! “How soon will replacements arrive?”\n“Five minutes.”\n“Get my reserve pod in here as fast as you can.” Teg touched Streggi’s neck with a knee.\nHaker spoke before she could turn. “Bashar, they got the reserve, too. I’ve ordered another.”\nTeg repressed a sigh. These things happened in battle but he didn’t like depending on primitive coms. “We'll set up here. Get more squawkers.” They, at least, had the range.\nHaker glanced at the greenery around them. “Here?”\n“I don’t like the look of those buildings up ahead. That tower commands this area. And they must have underground access. | would.”\n“There’s nothing on the...”\n“My memory layout doesn’t include that tower. Get sonics in here to check the ground. | want our plan brought up to the minute with secure information.”\nHaker’s squawker came alive with an override voice: “Bashar! Is the Bashar available?”\nStreggi moved him next to Haker without being told. Teg took the squawker, whistling his code as he grabbed it.\n“Bashar, it’s a mess at the Flat. About a hundred of them tried to lift and ran into our screen. No survivors.”\n“Any sign of Mother Superior or her Spider Queen?”\n“Negative. We can’t tell. | mean it’s a real mess. Shall | screen a view?”\n“Get me a dispatch. And keep looking for Odrade!”\n“| tell you nothing survived here, Bashar.” There was a click and a low hum, then another voice: “Dispatch.”\nTeg brought his voice-print coder from beneath his chin and barked quick orders. “Scramble a hammership over the Citadel. Put the scene at the Landing Flat and their other disasters on open relay. All bands. Make sure they can see it. Announce no survivors at the Flat.”\nThe double click of received-confirmed broke the link. Haker said: “Do you really think you can terrify them?”\n“Educate them.” He repeated Odrade’s parting words: “Their education has been sadly neglected.”\nWhat had happened to Odrade? He felt sure she must be dead, perhaps the first casualty here. She had expected that. Dead but not lost if Murbella could restrain her impetuosity.\nOdrade, at that moment, had Teg in direct sight from the tower. Logno had silenced her vital signs transmissions with a countersignal shield and had brought her to the tower Shortly after the arrival of the first refugees from Gammu.\nNo one questioned Logno’s supremacy. A dead Great Honored Matre and a live one could only be something familiar.\nExpecting to be killed at any moment, Odrade still gathered data as she went up in a nulltube with guards. The tube was an artifact from the Scattering, a transparent piston in a transparent cylinder. Few obstructing walls at the floors they passed. Mostly views of living areas and esoteric hardware Odrade surmised had military purposes. Lush evidence of comfort and quiet increased the higher they went.\nPower climbs physically as well as psychologically.\nHere they were at the top. A section of the tube cylinder swung outward and a guard pushed her roughly onto a thickly carpeted floor.\nThe workroom Dama showed me down there was another set piece.\nOdrade recognized secrecy. Equipment and furnishings here would have been almost unrecognizable were it not for Murbella’s knowledge. So other action centers were for show. Potemkin villages built for Reverend Mother.\nLogno lied about Dama’s intentions. | was expected to leave unharmed... carrying no useful information.\nWhat other lies had they paraded in front of her?\nLogno and all but one guard went to a console on Odrade’s right. Pivoting on one foot, Odrade looked around. This was the real center. She studied it with care. Odd place. An aura of the sanitary. Treated with chemicals to make it clean. No bacterial or viral contaminants. No strangers in the blood. Everything debugged like a showcase for rare viands. And Dama showed interest in Bene Gesserit immunity to diseases. There was bacterial warfare in the Scattering.\nThey want one thing from us!\nAnd just one surviving Reverend Mother would satisfy them if they could wrest information from her.\nA full Bene Gesserit cadre would have to examine the strands of this web and see where they led.\nIf we win.\nThe operations console where Logno concentrated her attention was smaller than the showcase ones. Fingerfield manipulation. The hood on a low table beside Logno was smaller and transparent, revealing the medusa tangle of probes.\nShigawire for sure.\nThe hood showed a close affinity to T-probes from the Scattering Teg and others had described. Did these women possess more technological marvels? They must.\nA glittering wall behind Logno, windows on her left opening onto a balcony, a far vista of Junction visible out there with movement of troops and armor. She recognized Teg in the distance, a figure on the shoulders of an adult, but gave no sign she saw anything extraordinary. She continued her slow study. Door to a passage with another nulltube partly visible in a separate area to her immediate left. More green tile on the floor there. Different functions in that space.\nA sudden burst of noises erupted beyond the wall. Odrade identified some of them. Boots of soldiers made a distinctive sound on tiles. Swish of exotic fabrics. Voices. She distinguished accents of Honored Matres responding to each other in tones of shock.\nWe're winning!\nShock was to be expected when the invincible were brought low. She studied Logno. Would it be a plunge into despair?\nIf so, | may survive.\nMurbella’s role might be changed. Well, that could wait. Sisters had been briefed on what to do in the event of victory. Neither they nor anyone else in the attack force would lay rough hands on an Honored Matre—erotic or\notherwise. Duncan had prepared the men, making the perils of sexual entrapment thoroughly known.\nRisk no bondage. Raise no new antagonisms.\nThe new Spider Queen was revealed now as someone even stranger than Odrade had suspected. Logno left her console and came to within a pace of Odrade. “You have won this battle. We are your prisoners.”\nNo orange in her eyes. Odrade swept her gaze around at the women who had been her guards. Blank expressions, clear eyes. Was this how they showed despair? It did not feel right. Logno and the others revealed no expected emotional responses.\nEverything under wraps?\nEvents of the past hours should create emotional crisis. Logno gave no sign of it. Not a twitch of revealing nerve or muscle. Perhaps a casual concern and that was all.\nA Bene Gesserit mask!\nIt had to be unconscious, something automatic ignited by defeat. So they did not really accept defeat.\nWe are still in there with them. Latent... but there! No wonder Murbella almost died. She was confronting her own genetic past as a supreme prohibition.\n“My companions,” Odrade said. “The three women who came with me. Where are they?”\n“Dead.” Logno’s voice was as dead as the word.\nOdrade suppressed a pang for Suipol. Tam and Dortujla had lived long and useful lives, but Suipol... dead and never Shared.\nAnother good one lost. And isn’t that a bitter lesson!\n“I will identify the ones responsible if you desire revenge,” Logno said.\nLesson two.\n“Revenge is for children and the emotionally retarded.”\nA small return of orange in Logno’s eyes.\nHuman self-delusion took many forms, Odrade reminded herself. Aware that the Scattering would produce the\nunexpected, she had armed herself accordingly with a protective remoteness that would allow her a space to assess new places, new things and new people. She had known she would be forced to put many things in different categories to serve her or deflect threats. She took Logno’s attitude as a threat.\n“You do not seem disturbed, Great Honored Matre.”\n“Others will avenge me.” Flat, very self-composed.\nThe words were even stranger than her composure. She held everything under that close cover, bits and pieces revealed now in flickering movements aroused by Odrade’s observation. Deep and intense things, but buried. It was all inside there, masked the way a Reverend Mother would mask it. Logno appeared to have no power at all and yet she spoke as though nothing essential had changed.\n“Lam your captive but that makes no difference.”\nWas she truly powerless? No/ But that was the impression she wished to convey and all of the other Honored Matres around her mirrored this response.\n“See us? Powerless except for the loyalty of our Sisters and the followers they have bonded to us.”\nWere Honored Matres that confident of their vengeful legions? Possible only if they had never before suffered a defeat of this kind. Yet someone had driven them back into the Old Empire. Into the Million Planets.\nTeg found Odrade and her captives while seeking a place to assess victory. Battle always required its analytical aftermath, especially from a Mentat commander. It was a comparison test this battle demanded of him more\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6f6e77311a08a2bbffc237de67a4e43a958b71a7666cf387b0c776ae1e21a90b_v2"}
