He glanced through open windows of the flag-topped building on his right. The Atreides banner flying over that? The window opened into an auditorium with a low ceiling, a bandshell at the far end enclosing a small platform. He saw rows of seats, maroon carpeting on the floor. It had all the look of a stage setting, a place to entertain tourists.\nThe sound of shuffling feet brought Idaho’s attention back to Garun. Children were pressing forward around the delegation, extending clumps of garish red flowers in their grimy hands. The flowers were wilted.\nGarun addressed himself to Siona, correctly identifying the gold piping of Fish Speaker Command in her uniform.\n“Will you wish a performance of our Fremen rituals?” he asked. “The music, perhaps? The dance?”\nNayla accepted a bunch of flowers from one of the children, sniffed them and sneezed.\nAnother urchin extended flowers toward Siona, lifting a wide-eyed stare toward her. She accepted the flowers without looking at the child. Idaho merely waved the children aside as they approached him. They hesitated, staring up at him, then scurried around him toward the rest of the troop.\nGarun spoke to Idaho. “If you give them a few coins, they will not bother you.”\nIdaho shuddered. Was this the training for Fremen children?\nGarun returned his attention to Siona. With Nayla listening, Garun began explaining the layout of his village.\nIdaho moved away from them down the street, noting how glances flicked toward him and then avoided his gaze. He felt deeply offended by the surface decorations on the buildings, none of it disguising the evidence of decay. He stared in an open doorway at the auditorium. There was a harshness in Tuono, a struggling something behind the wilting flowers and the servile tone of Garun’s voice. In\nanother time and on another planet, this would have been a donkey-in-the-street village—rope-belted peasants pressing forward with petitions. He could hear the whine of supplication in Garun’s voice. These were not Fremen! These poor creatures lived on the margins, trying to retain parts of an ancient wholeness. And all the while, that lost reality slipped farther and farther from their grasp. What had Leto created here? These Museum Fremen were lost to everything except a bare existence and the rote mouthing of old words which they did not understand and which they did not even pronounce correctly!\nReturning to Siona, Idaho bent to study the cut of Garun’s brown robe, seeing a tightness in it dictated by a need to conserve fabric. The gray slick of a stillsuit could be seen underneath, exposed to sunlight which no real Fremen would ever have let touch his stillsuit that way. Idaho looked at the rest of the delegation, noting an identical parsimonious treatment of fabric. It betrayed their emotional bent. Such garments allowed no expansive gestures, no freedom of movement. The robes were tight and confining in the way of these entire people!\nDisgust propelling him, Idaho strode forward abruptly and parted Garun’s robe to look at the stillsuit. Just as he suspected! The suit was another sham—no arms to it, no boot-pumps!\nGarun pulled back, putting a hand to the knife hilt Idaho had exposed at the man’s belt. “Here! What’re you doing?” Garun demanded, his voice querulous. “You don’t touch a Fremen thus!”\n“You, a Fremen?” Idaho demanded. “I lived with Fremen! | fought by their sides against Harkonnens! | died with Fremen! You? You’re a sham!”\nGarun’s knuckles went white on the knife haft. He addressed himself to Siona. “Who is this man?”\nNayla spoke up: “This is Duncan Idaho.”\n“The ghola?” Garun turned to look at Idaho’s face. “We have never seen your like here before.”\nIdaho felt himself almost overcome with desire to cleanse this place even if it cost him his life, this diminished life which could be repeated endlessly by people who had no real concerns for him. An o/der model, yes! But this was no Fremen.\n“Draw that knife or take your hand off it,” Idaho said. Garun jerked his hand away from the knife. “It is not a real knife,” he said. “Only for decoration.” His voice became eager. “But we have real knives, even crysknives! They are\nkept locked in the display cases to preserve them.”\nIdaho could not help himself. He threw his head back in laughter. Siona smiled, but Nayla looked thoughtful and the rest of the Fish Speaker troop drew into a close, watchful circle around them.\nThe laughter had an odd effect on Garun. He lowered his head and clasped his hands tightly together, but not before Idaho saw them trembling. When Garun peered upward once more, it was to look at Idaho from beneath heavy brows. Idaho felt abruptly sobered. It was as though some terrible boot had crushed Garun’s ego into fearful subservience. There was watchful waiting in the man’s eyes. And for no reason he could explain, Idaho remembered a passage from the Orange Catholic Bible. He asked himself: Are these the meek who will outwait us all and inherit the universe?\nGarun cleared his throat, then: “Perhaps the ghola Duncan Idaho will witness our ways and our ritual and judge them?”\nIdaho felt shamed by the plaintive request. He spoke without thinking: “I will teach you anything Fremen that | know.” He looked up to see Nayla scowling at him. “It will help to pass the time,” he said. “And who knows? It may return something of the true Fremen to this land.”\nSiona said: “We've no need to play old cultish games! Take us to our quarters.”\nNayla lowered her head in embarrassment and spoke without looking at Siona. “Commander, there is a thing | have not ventured to tell you.”\n“That you must make sure we stay in this filthy place,” Siona said.\n“Oh, no!” Nayla looked up at Siona’s face. “Where could you go? The Wall cannot be climbed and there is only the river beyond it, anyway. And in the other direction, it is the Sareer. Oh, no... it is something else.” Nayla shook her head.\n“Out with it!” Siona snapped.\n“lam under the strictest orders, Commander, which | dare not disobey.” Nayla glanced at the other members of the troop then back to Siona. “You and the... Duncan Idaho are to be quartered together.”\n“My father’s orders?”\n“Lady Commander, they are said to be the orders of the God Emperor himself and we dare not disobey.”\nSiona looked full at Idaho. “You will remember my warning, Duncan, when last we spoke at the Citadel?”\n“My hands are mine to do with as | wish,” Idaho snarled. “| don’t think you have any doubts about my wishes!”\nShe turned away from him after a curt nod and looked at Garun. “What does it matter where we bed in this disgusting place? Take us to our quarters.”\nIdaho found Garun’s response fascinating—a turning of the head toward the ghola, shielding the face behind the Fremen hood, then a secret conspiratorial wink. Only then did Garun lead them away down the dirty street.\nWhat is the most immediate danger to my stewardship? | will tell you. It is a true visionary, a person who has stood in the presence of God with the full knowledge of where he stands. Visionary ecstasy releases energies which are like the energies of sex—uncaring for anything except creation. One act of creation can be much like another. Everything depends upon the vision.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\neto lay without his cart on the high, sheltered balcony of\nhis Little Citadel tower, subduing a fretfulness which he knew came from the necessary delays putting off the date of his wedding to Hwi Noree. He stared toward the southwest. Somewhere off there beyond the darkening horizon, the Duncan, Siona and their companions had been six days in Tuono Village.\nThe delays are my own fault, Leto thought. / am the one who changed the place for the wedding, making it necessary for poor Moneo to revise all of his preparations.\nAnd now, of course, there was the matter of Malky.\nNone of these necessities could be explained to Moneo, who could be heard stirring about within the central chamber of the aerie, worrying about his absence from the command post where he directed the festive preparations. Moneo was such a worrier!\nLeto looked toward the setting sun. It floated low to the horizon, faded a dim orange by a recent storm. Rain crouched low in the clouds to the south beyond the Sareer now. In a prolonged silence, Leto had watched the rain there for a time which had stretched out with no beginning or end. The clouds had grown out of a hard gray sky, rain walking in visible lines. He had felt himself clothed in memories that\ncame unbidden. The mood was hard to shake off and, without even thinking, he muttered the remembered lines of an ancient verse.\n“Did you speak, Lord?” Moneo’s voice came from close beside Leto. By merely turning his eyes, Leto could see the faithful majordomo standing attentively waiting.\nLeto translated into Galach as he quoted: “The nightingale nests in the plum tree, but what will she do with the wind?”\n“Is that a question, Lord?”\n“An old question. The answer is simple. Let the nightingale keep to her flowers.”\n“| don’t understand, Lord.”\n“Stop mouthing the obvious, Moneo. It disturbs me when you do that.”\n“Forgive me, Lord.”\n“What else can | do?” Leto studied Moneo’s downcast features. “You and |, Moneo, whatever else we do, we provide good theater.”\nMoneo peered at Leto’s face. “Lord?”\n“The rites of the religious festival of Bacchus were the seeds of Greek theater, Moneo. Religion often leads to theater. They will have fine theater out of us.” Once more, Leto turned and looked at the southwest horizon.\nThere was a wind there now piling up the clouds. Leto thought he could hear driven sand blustering along the dunes, but there was only resonant quiet in the tower aerie, a quiet with the faintest of wind hiss behind it.\n“The clouds,” he whispered. “I would take a cup of moonlight once more, an ancient sea barge at my feet, thin clouds clinging to my darkling sky, the blue-gray cloak around my shoulders and horses neighing nearby.”\n“My Lord is troubled,” Moneo said. The compassion in his voice wrenched at Leto.\n“The bright shadows of my pasts,” Leto said. “They never leave me in peace. | listened for a soothing sound, the bell\nof a country town at nightfall, and it told me only that | am the sound and soul of this place.”\nAs he spoke, darkness enclosed the tower. Automatic lights came on around them. Leto kept his attention directed outward where a thin melon slice of First Moon drifted above the clouds with orange planet-light revealing the satellite’s full circle.\n“Lord, why have we come out here?” Moneo asked. “Why won't you tell me?”\n“I wanted the benefit of your surprise,” Leto said. “A Guild lighter will land beside us out here soon. My Fish Speakers bring Malky\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8853d3b7829003b0ba7e03f0c09d49850664e8ab9bd4c5779aba7a600c5834c3_v2"}
