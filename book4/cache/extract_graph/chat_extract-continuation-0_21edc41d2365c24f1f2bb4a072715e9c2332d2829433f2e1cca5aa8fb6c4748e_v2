\n　　两家的秋田锄过以后，少安这才开始动手修建他的新地方。一切都开始忙乱起来；但由于这是为自己谋幸福，少安和秀莲都有说不出的兴奋！ \n　　他们把新居的地址选在离烧砖窑不远的山崖根下。这里不仅土脉坚硬，据米家镇已故米阴阳当年称，这地方风水也好得不能再好：前面有玉带两条——公路和东拉河；西山五个土台子一字排开，形似五朵莲花……以前没人在此建宅，主要是这地方已到村外。现在他们乐意占这块风水宝地：一是清静，二是离他们的烧砖窑近。 \n　　开挖土窑洞是一件技术性很强的工作，最少得聘请一位行家领料另外的雇工，双水村打土窑最出色的专家是金俊文。可是现在，别说一天出五块工钱，就是出十块钱也把金俊文请不来了。俊文因为大儿子有了“出息”，家业急骤发达起来，已不把百二八十的钱放在眼里了。他整天穿戴一新，在山里做点轻活（重活有二小子金强哩），然后逢集到石圪节的土街上去悠哉悠哉；在胡得福的饭馆里喝二两烧酒，吃一盘猪头肉，日子过得象神仙一般快活！ \n　　少安知道请不动金俊文，于是就到山背后的王家庄请了一名高手；然后又在村中雇了几个关系要好的庄稼人，便开始大张旗鼓地为自己建造新屋。多少年来，双水村第一次有人如此大动土木。人们羡慕不已，但并不感到过分惊讶。在大家看来，孙少安已经跃居本村“发财户”的前列，如今当然轮上这小子张扬一番了！ \n                  第15章\n　　对于孙玉亭来说，眼前的生活仍然象梦一般不可思议。 \n　　实行责任制尽管半年多了，他还没有从这个变化中反应过来——农村的改革如同一次大爆炸，把我们的玉亭同志震成了严重的脑震荡……失去了亲爱的集体以后，孙玉亭感到就象没娘的孩子一样灰溜溜的。唉，他不得不象众人一样单家独户过日子了。他当然也不再是双水村举足轻重的人物。人们现在在村巷里碰见他。甚至连个招呼也不打，就象他不存在似的。哼！想当初，双水村什么事上能离开他孙玉亭？想不到转眼间，他就活得这么不值钱？他眷恋往日的岁月，那时虽然他少吃缺穿，可心情儿畅快呀！而今，就象魂灵一下子被什么人勾销了…… \n　　起初，玉亭根本没心思一个人出山去种地，他要么闷头睡在烂席片土炕上，接二连三地叹气：要么就跑到村前的公路上，意想天开地希望听到外面传来“好消息”，说集体又要恢复呀！如果村里\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
