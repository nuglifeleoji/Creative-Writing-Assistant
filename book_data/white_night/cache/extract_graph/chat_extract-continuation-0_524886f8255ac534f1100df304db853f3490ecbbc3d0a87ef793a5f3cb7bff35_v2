但是，也就在这时，一声低吼突然响起。\n\n    蓝轩宇带给钱磊的，不只是召唤上的变化，同时，还能增加他的召唤速度。\n\n    当这声低吼响起的时候，除了蓝轩宇之外，在场众人都有种心跳漏了一拍的感觉。一股凶厉之气瞬间传遍整个擂台。\n\n    “叮！”舒香衣的猫爪落下，却只觉得自己仿佛抓中了铁板似的，指甲瞬间断裂，虽说模拟舱内痛感很低，却还是让这小姑娘尖叫一声，转身后跃。\n\n    但是，宛如重锤一般的存在却在这个时候横扫而来，正好撞在了她身上。\n\n    只听“砰”的一声，舒香衣已经化为一道光芒消失无踪。\n\n    而此时此刻，众人才看清了那“罪魁祸首”。\n\n    那是一只爬行动物，刚刚从召唤之门中爬出来。通体覆盖着黑黝黝的鳞片，身长超过七米，看起来像一只巨大的蜥蜴，尤其是头部特别大，一张大嘴张开，有种能吞食天地般的感觉。\n\n    刚刚撞击在舒香衣身上的，就是它那硕大的头部，猝不及防之下，只有一环修为的舒香衣甚至连反应都没来得及，直接就被秒杀了。\n\n    鳄龙！亚龙种，地龙的一种。魂兽中极为罕见，甚至在蓝轩宇的记忆中，都无法辨别出眼前这只鳄龙究竟是什么层次的修为。\n\n    鳄龙甩头击杀了舒香衣，但它的下一个动作却令场中所有人都不禁有些呆滞。\n\n    它那硕大的头颅低下来，低在蓝轩宇的脚边，然后特别谨慎的，轻轻的在蓝轩宇小腿上蹭了蹭。\n\n    是的，蹭了蹭……\n\n    这……\n\n    张瑞妍和童萌如看的都有点发呆。召唤成功了？自己这运气也太差了吧？无论怎么看，这鳄龙的实力都绝对不弱啊！\n\n

这时候就显现出高能少年班学员的素质了，换了同龄人，哪怕是魂师，面对如此凶恶模样的鳄龙，恐怕早就吓得不行了。但童萌如和张瑞妍却还是第一时间做出了反应。\n\n    童萌如大步跨出，猛的大喝一声，身体\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
