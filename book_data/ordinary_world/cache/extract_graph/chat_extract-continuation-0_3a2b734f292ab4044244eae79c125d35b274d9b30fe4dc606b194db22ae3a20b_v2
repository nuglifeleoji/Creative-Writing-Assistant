奔各的前程，小女儿今年也要从高中毕业了。要说有什么不畅快，那就是大女儿兰花的不幸——这是他永远不愈的心病。唉，有什么办法呢？老天爷总要给人弄一点不如意！ \n　　正在这个忙忙乱的当口，孙玉厚的老母亲突然生病了。其实，老人家浑身一直都是病。但这次看来得了急症——肚子疼。 \n　　这可把孙玉厚急坏了！ \n　　老母亲已经一天水米没沾牙，卷曲在炕头上不时发出呻吟。生命顽强的老人，今年整整八十四岁了。七十三、八十四，阎王不叫自己去——这是高龄老人最忌讳的两个岁数。 \n　　孙玉厚不敢再出山去了。他一时急得不知如何是好。少安也不在家——他到原西和一个建筑单位签合同去了；据秀莲说，得五六天才能回来。 \n　　晚饭后，他把玉亭叫了来。兄弟俩开始商量怎么办。 \n　　两兄弟决定立刻把老母亲用架子车拉到石圪节医院去。不料，老母亲坚决不去医院。 \n　　她呻吟着说：“你们把刘玉升叫来！” \n　　兄弟俩听母亲说这话，一时面面相觑，倒不知该怎办。他们知道母亲叫刘玉升来是什么意思。一年前，他们村的刘玉升在一夜之间由凡人变成了“神仙”，开始给周围村庄的庄稼人“治病”，据说特别“灵验”。奇怪！这事什么时间倒传进了这个不出门的老人耳朵里？ \n　　孙玉亭嘴对着母亲的耳朵说：“妈，那是迷信！”他妈不管迷信不迷信，继续用微弱的声音坚定地说：“你们把刘玉升叫来！我夜里梦见一只白狗，在我肚子上咬了一口，早上起来就疼开了……” \n　　怎么办？是不是去叫刘玉升来“捉拿”这只该死的“白狗”呢？ \n　　兄弟俩大眼瞪小眼。 \n　　孙玉厚无可奈何地说：“那就去叫刘玉升吧！” \n　　“你也相信这神神鬼鬼？”玉亭瞪住眼问他哥。“也不能说有，也不能说没有……”孙玉厚含含糊糊说。“我不能做这事。我歪好还算个共产党员哩！”玉亭在这方面的原则性是不可动摇的。 \n　　孙玉厚叹了一口气说：“那你回去，让我去叫刘玉升，不要牵连你……” \n　　本来，孙玉亭坚决反对去叫“神汉”刘玉升。但这是他母亲的要求，他无法用革命道理说服这位糊涂的老人。玉亭只好怏怏不快地离开这个即将发生“是非”的地方，拖拉着两只烂鞋赶紧回田家圪崂去了。 \n　　玉亭走后不久，孙玉厚老汉就起身去前村请刘玉升……关于刘玉升的情况，我们过去了解甚微。我们只知道他是已改\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
