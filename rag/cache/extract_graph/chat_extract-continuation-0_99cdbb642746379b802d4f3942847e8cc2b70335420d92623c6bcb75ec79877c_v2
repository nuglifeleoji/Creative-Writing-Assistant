Will you become another Alia?”\nAt last Ghanima leaned against him, whispered: “She has accepted it. She’s gone.”\nHe stroked her head. “Ghani, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. l'II never ask you to do that again. | was selfish. Forgive me.”\n“There’s nothing to forgive,” she said, and her voice came panting as though after great physical exertion. “We've learned much that we needed to know.”\n“She spoke to you of many things,” he said. “We’ll share it later when—”\n“No! We'll do it now. You were right.”\n“My Golden Path?”\n“Your damned Golden Path!”\n“Logic’s useless unless it’s armed with essential data,” he said. “But I—”\n“Grandmother came back to guide our education and to see if we’d been... contaminated.”\n“That’s what Duncan says. There’s nothing new in—”\n“Prime computation,” she agreed, her voice strengthening. She pulled away from him, looked out at the desert which lay in a predawn hush. This battle... this knowledge, had cost them a night. The Royal Guard beyond the moisture seal must have had much to explain. Leto had charged that nothing disturb them.\n“People often learn subtlety as they age,” Leto said. “What is it we’re learning with all of this agedness to draw upon?”\n“The universe as we see it is never quite the exact physical universe,” she said. “We mustn’t perceive this grandmother just as a grandmother.”\n“That'd be dangerous,” he agreed. “But my ques—”\n“There’s something beyond subtlety,” she said. “We must have a place in our awareness to perceive what we can’t preconceive. That’s why ... my mother spoke to me often of Jessica. At the last, when we were both reconciled to the inner exchange, she said many things.” Ghanima sighed.\n“We know she’s our grandmother,” he said. “You were with her for hours yesterday. Is that why—”\n“If we allow it, our knowing will determine how we react to her,” Ghanima said. “That’s what my mother kept warning me. She quoted our grandmother once and—” Ghanima touched his arm. “—I heard the echo of it within me in our grandmother’s voice.”\n“Warning you,” Leto said. He found this thought disturbing. Was nothing in this world dependable?\n“Most deadly errors arise from obsolete assumptions,” Ghanima said. “That’s what my mother kept quoting.”\n“That’s pure Bene Gesserit.”\n“If... if Jessica has gone back to the Sisterhood completely...”\n“That'd be very dangerous to us,” he said, completing the thought. “We carry the blood of their Kwisatz Haderach— their male Bene Gesserit.”\n“They won’t abandon that search,” she said, “but they may abandon us. Our grandmother could be the instrument.”\n“There’s another way,” he said.\n“Yes—the two of us... mated. But they know what recessives might complicate that pairing.”\n“Its a gamble they must've discussed.”\n“And with our grandmother, at that. | don’t like that way.”\n“Nor I.”\n“Still, it’s not the first time a royal line has tried to...”\n“It repels me,” he said, shuddering.\nShe felt the movement, fell silent.\n“Power,” he said.\nAnd in that strange alchemy of their similarities she knew where his thoughts had been. “The power of the Kwisatz Haderach must fail,” she agreed.\n“Used in their way,” he said.\nIn that instant, day came to the desert beyond their vantage point. They sensed the heat beginning. Colors leaped forth from the plantings beneath the cliff. Grey-green leaves sent spiked shadows along the ground. The low morning light of Dune’s silvery sun revealed the verdant oasis full of golden and purple shadows in the well of the Sheltering cliffs.\nLeto stood, stretched.\n“The Golden Path, then,” Ghanima said, and she spoke as much to herself as to him, knowing how their father’s last vision met and melted into Leto’s dreams.\nSomething brushed against the moisture seals behind them and voices could be heard murmuring there.\nLeto reverted to the ancient language they used for privacy: “L’ii ani howr samis sm’kwi owr samit sut.”\nThat was where the decision lodged itself in their awareness. Literally: We will accompany each other into deathliness, though only one may return to report it.\nGhanima stood then and, together, they returned through the moisture seals to the sietch, where the guards roused themselves and fell in behind as the twins headed toward their own quarters. The throngs parted before them with a difference on this morning, exchanging glances with the guards. Spending the night alone above the desert was an old Fremen custom for the holy sages. All the Uma had practiced this form of vigil. Paul Muad’Dib had done it... and Alia. Now the royal twins had begun.\nLeto noted the difference, mentioned it to Ghanima.\n“They don’t know what we’ve decided for them,” she said. “They don’t really know.”\nStill in the private language, he said: “It requires the most fortuitous beginning.”\nGhanima hesitated a moment to form her thoughts. Then: “In that time, mourning for the sibling, it must be exactly real—even to the making of the tomb. The heart must follow the sleep lest there be no awakening.”\nIn the ancient tongue it was an extremely convoluted statement, employing a pronominal object separated from the infinitive. It was a syntax which allowed each set of internal phrases to turn upon itself, becoming several different meanings, all definite and quite distinct but subtly interrelated. In part, what she had said was that they risked death with Leto’s plan and, real or simulated, it made no difference. The resultant change would be like death, literally: “funeral murder.” And there was an added meaning to the whole which pointed accusatively at whoever survived to report, that is: act out the living part. Any misstep there would negate the entire plan, and Leto’s Golden Path would become a dead end.\n“Extremely delicate,” Leto agreed. He parted the hangings for them as they entered their own anteroom.\nActivity among their attendants paused only for a heartbeat as the twins crossed to the arched passage which led into the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica.\n“You are not Osiris,” Ghanima reminded him.\n“Nor will I try to be.”\nGhanima took his arm to stop him. “Alia darsatay haunus m’smow,” she warned.\nLeto stared into his sister’s eyes. Indeed, Alia’s actions did give off a foul smell which their grandmother must have noted. He smiled appreciatively at Ghanima. She had mixed the ancient tongue with Fremen superstition to call up a most basic tribal omen. M’smow, the foul odor of a summer night, was the harbinger of death at the hands of demons. And Isis had been the demon-goddess of death to the people whose tongue they now spoke.\n“We Atreides have a reputation for audacity to maintain,” he said.\n“So we'll take what we need,” she said.\n“It’s that or become petitioners before our own Regency,” he said. “Alia would enjoy that.”\n“But our plan...” She let it trail off.\nOur plan, he thought. She shared it completely now. He said: “I think of our plan as the toil of the shaduf.”\nGhanima glanced back at the anteroom through which they’d passed, smelling the furry odors of morning with their sense of eternal beginning. She liked the way Leto had employed their private language. Toil of the shaduf. It was a pledge. He’d called their plan agricultural work of a very menial kind: fertilizing, irrigating, weeding, transplanting, pruning—yet with the Fremen implication that this labor occurred simultaneously in Another World where it symbolized cultivating the richness of the soul.\nGhanima studied her brother as they hesitated here in the rock passage. It had grown increasingly obvious to her that he was pleading on two levels: one, for the Golden Path of his vision and their father’s, and two, that she allow him free\nreign to carry out the extremely dangerous myth-creation which the plan generated. This frightened her. Was there more to his private vision that he had not shared? Could he see himself as the potentially deified figure to lead humankind into a rebirth—like father, like son? The cult of Muad’Dib had turned sour, fermenting in Alia’s mismanagement and the unbridled license of a military priesthood which rode the Fremen power. Leto wanted regeneration.\nHe’s hiding something from me, she realized.\nShe reviewed what he had told her of his dream. It held such iridescent reality that he might walk around for hours afterward in a daze. The dream never varied, he said.\n“Lam on sand in bright yellow daylight, yet there is no sun. Then I realize that |! am the sun. My light shines out as a Golden Path. When I realize this, | move out of myself. | turn, expecting to see myself as the sun. But I am not the sun; l am a stick figure, a child’s drawing with zigzag lightning lines for eyes, stick legs and stick arms. There Is a scepter in my left hand, and it’s a real scepter—much more detailed in its reality than the stick figure which holds it. The scepter moves, and this terrifies me. As it moves, | feel myself awaken, yet I know I’m still dreaming. | realize then that my skin is encased in something—an armor which moves as my skin moves. | cannot see this armor, but I feel it. My terror leaves me then, for this armor gives me the strength of ten thousand men.”\nAs Ghanima stared at him, Leto tried to pull away, to continue their course toward Jessica’s quarters. Ghanima resisted.\n“This Golden Path could be no better than any other path,” she said.\nLeto looked at the rock floor between them, feeling the strong return of Ghanima’s doubts. “I must do it,” he said.\n“Alia is possessed,” she said. “That could happen to us. could already have happened and we might not know it.”\nt\n“No.” He shook his head, met her gaze. “Alia resisted. That gave the powers within her their strength. By her own strength she was overcome. We've dared to search within, to seek out the old languages and the old knowledge. We’re already amalgams of those lives within us. We don’t resist; we ride with them. This was what I learned from our father last night. It’s what | had to learn.”\n“He said nothing of that within me.”\n“You listened to our mother. It’s what we—”\n“And | almost lost.”\n“Is she still strong within you?” Fear tightened his face.\n“Yes ... but now | think she guards me with her love. You were very good when you argued with her.” And Ghanima thought about the reflected mother-within, said: “Our mother exists now for me in the alam al-mythal with the others, but she has tasted the fruit of hell. Now I can listen to her without fear. As to the others...”\n“Yes,” he said. “And | listened to my father, but I think I’m really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom | was named. Perhaps the name makes it easy.”\n“Are you\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is one of the royal twins, daughter of Paul Muad'Dib, and shares a deep connection with her brother Leto.
