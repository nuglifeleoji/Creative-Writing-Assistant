\n　　尽管到了农忙季节，地里有一大堆活，但孙玉亭下午不再出山去了。他拿了原大队部公窑门上的钥匙，匆忙地来打扫这个多年封门闭户的地方。 \n　　玉亭情绪激动地打开公窑门，脸却一沉。他在公窑积满尘土的脚地上呆立了片刻，实在有点心酸。他看见，往年这个红火热闹的地方，现在一片凄凉冷清。地上炕上都蒙着一层灰土，墙上那些“农业学大寨”运动中上级奖励的锦旗，灰尘蒙的连字也看不清楚了。后窑掌间或还有老鼠结队而行。 \n　　孙玉亭发了一会愣怔，头上象妇女一样反包起毛巾，便开始打扫这间公窑。 \n　　忙了几乎一个下午，办公窑终于被玉亭重新收拾得一干二净。地上，炕上，还有那个小炕桌，都被他弄得清清爽爽；墙上的锦旗揩抹了灰尘，又满目光彩，说实话，玉亭在自己家里干活也没这么卖力。他是充满感情在做这无偿的营生；他在此间获得了精神上的满足！ \n　　傍晚，当他给其他几位党支部成员通知了开会的消息后，又赶回公窑用破报纸团蘸着口水擦了煤油灯的玻璃罩子，灯罩擦净后，他才发现灯壶里连一滴煤油也没有了。公而忘私的玉亭决定拿回家把自家那点不多的煤油灌上一灯壶。 \n　　天一擦黑，玉亭就赶回家胡乱吃喝了一点，又给公家的灯壶里灌满了自家的煤油，就拖拉起烂鞋，兴致勃勃赶到公窑里。 \n　　他当然是第一个到会的人。 \n　　他把煤油灯点亮，放在小炕桌上，就专等其他四个人的到来。 \n　　支书田福堂，副支书金俊山，另外两个支委金俊武和田海民，都先后来到了这个他们已经久违了的地方。 \n　　五个人凑到一起，都感到怪新奇的。大家一时有点反应不过来：怎么？他们又开会了？ \n　　是呀，他们对开会都有点陌生了！现在，相互间就好象久别的熟人，不由一个看一个。除过田福堂，所有人身上的劳动痕迹都加重了，脸也比过去晒黑了许多。 \n　　由于多时没在一块，五个人气氛倒很融洽，大家先说闲话。主要是说前不久的“吃鱼事件”和“跑蜂事件”。由于海民在场，“吃鱼事件”说得少一些，集中说笑金光亮的“意大利蜂”逃跑一事。金俊武开玩笑说：“那蜂可能是想了老家，跑回意大利去了！据说那是个资本主义国家，生活比咱们这里好！”这话惹得大家哄笑\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
