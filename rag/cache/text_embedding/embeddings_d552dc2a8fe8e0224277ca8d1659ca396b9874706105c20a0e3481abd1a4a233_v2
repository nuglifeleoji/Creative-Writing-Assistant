Huge battles, and even one that is environmentally catastrophic, occur behind the scenes.\nAs | wrote in Dreamer of Dune, the biography of my father, Heretics of Dune was actually intended to be the first book of a new trilogy that would complete the epic story chronologically. It is set thousands of years in mankind’s future, long after the events in Dune. Before his untimely death in 1986, Frank Herbert wrote the first two books of the trilogy (Heretics and Chapterhouse), but he left the third unwritten. Using my father’s outline and notes, | eventually co-wrote the grand climax with Kevin J. Anderson, but it required two novels for us to do so—Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007).\nHeretics of Dune is the beginning of that extraordinary, climactic adventure, a giant leap in time and space beyond the novels preceding it. In this novel, you will meet a diverse and complex cast of characters, inhabiting worlds that stretch the imagination. It is a journey into what my father liked to call one of humankind’s “possible futures,” showing where we might very well be headed, into a tableau that is at once terrifying and exhilarating. Even with its complexities, Heretics is a page-turner, a novel that will not disappoint the most critical of Dune fans. After reading the last page of the book, you will want to go back and read it again, revisiting old friends in a fantastic realm that never quite leaves your thoughts.\nBrian Herbert Seattle, Washington\nJune 24, 2008\nMost discipline is hidden discipline, designed not to liberate but to limit. Do not ask Why? Be cautious with How? Why? leads inexorably to paradox. How? traps you in a universe of cause and effect. Both deny the infinite.\n—THE APOCRYPHA OF ARRAKIS\nvy lees told you, did she not, that we have gone through eleven of these Duncan Idaho gholas? This one is the twelfth.”\nThe old Reverend Mother Schwangyu spoke with deliberate bitterness as she looked down from the third- story parapet at the lone child playing on the enclosed lawn. The planet Gammu’s bright midday sunlight bounced off the white courtyard walls filling the area beneath them with brilliance as though a spotlight had been directed onto the young ghola.\nGone through! the Reverend Mother Lucilla thought. She allowed herself a short nod, thinking how coldly impersonal were Schwangyu’s manner and choice of words. We have used up our supply; send us more!\nThe child on the lawn appeared to be about twelve standard years of age, but appearance could be deceptive with a ghola not yet awakened to his original memories. The child took that moment to look up at the watchers above him. He was a sturdy figure with a direct gaze that focused intently from beneath a black cap of karakul hair. The yellow sunlight of early spring cast a small shadow at his feet. His Skin was darkly tanned but a slight movement of his body shifted his blue singlesuit, revealing pale skin at the left shoulder.\n“Not only are these gholas costly but they are supremely dangerous to us,” Schwangyu said. Her voice came out flat\nand emotionless, all the more powerful because of that. It was the voice of a Reverend Mother Instructor speaking down to an acolyte and it emphasized for Lucilla that Schwangyu was one of those who protested openly against the ghola project.\nTaraza had warned: “She will try to win you over.”\n“Eleven failures are enough,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla glanced at Schwangyu’s wrinkled features, thinking suddenly: Someday I may be old and wizened, too. And perhaps I will be a power in the Bene Gesserit as well.\nSchwangyu was a small woman with many age marks earned in the Sisterhood’s affairs. Lucilla knew from her own assignment-studies that Schwangyu’s conventional black robe concealed a skinny figure that few other than her acolyte dressers and the males bred to her had ever seen. Schwangyu’s mouth was wide, the lower lip constricted by the age lines that fanned into a jutting chin. Her manner tended to a curt abruptness that the uninitiated often interpreted as anger. The commander of the Gammu Keep was one who kept herself to herself more than most Reverend Mothers.\nOnce more, Lucilla wished she knew the entire scope of the ghola project. Taraza had drawn the dividing line clearly enough, though: “Schwangyu is not to be trusted where the safety of the ghola is concerned.”\n“We think the Tleilaxu themselves killed most of the previous eleven,” Schwangyu said. “That in itself should tell us something.”\nMatching Schwangyu’s manner, Lucilla adopted a quiet attitude of almost emotionless waiting. Her manner said: “| may be much younger than you, Schwangyu, but I, too, am a full Reverend Mother.” She could feel Schwangyu’s gaze.\nSchwangyu had seen the holos of this Lucilla but the woman in the flesh was more disconcerting. An Imprinter of the best training, no doubt of it. Blue-in-blue eyes uncorrected by any lens gave Lucilla a piercing expression\nthat went with her long oval face. With the hood of her black aba robe thrown back as it was now, brown hair was revealed, drawn into a tight barette and then cascading down her back. Not even the stiffest robe could completely hide Lucilla’s ample breasts. She was from a genetic line famous for its motherly nature and she already had borne three children for the Sisterhood, two by the same sire. Yes —a brown-haired charmer with full breasts and a motherly disposition.\n“You say very little,” Schwangyu said. “This tells me that Taraza has warned you against me.”\n“Do you have reason to believe assassins will try to kill this twelfth ghola?” Lucilla asked.\n“They already have tried.”\nStrange how the word “heresy” came to mind when thinking of Schwangyu, Lucilla thought. Could there be heresy among the Reverend Mothers? The religious overtones of the word seemed out of place in a Bene Gesserit context. How could there be heretical movements among people who held a profoundly manipulative attitude toward all things religious?\nLucilla shifted her attention down to the ghola, who took this moment to perform a series of cartwheels that brought him around full circle until he once more stood looking up at the two observers on the parapet.\n“How prettily he performs!” Schwangyu sneered. The old voice did not completely mask an underlying violence.\nLucilla glanced at Schwangyu. Heresy. “Dissidence” was not the proper word. “Opposition” did not cover what could be sensed in the older woman. This was something that could shatter the Bene Gesserit. Revolt against Taraza, against the Reverend Mother Superior? Unthinkable! Mother Superiors were cast in the mold of monarch. Once Taraza had accepted counsel and advice and then made her decision, the Sisters were committed to obedience.\n“This is no time to be creating new problems!” Schwangyu said.\nHer meaning was clear. People from the Scattering were coming back and the intent of some among those Lost Ones threatened the Sisterhood. Honored Matres! How like “Reverend Mothers” the words sounded.\nLucilla ventured an exploratory sally: “So you think we should be concentrating on the problem of those Honored Matres from the Scattering?”\n“Concentrating? Hah! They do not have our powers. They do not show good sense. And they do not have mastery of melange! That is what they want from us, our spice knowledge.”\n“Perhaps,” Lucilla agreed. She was not willing to concede this on the scanty evidence.\n“Mother Superior Taraza has taken leave of her senses to dally with this ghola thing now,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla remained silent. The ghola project definitely had touched an old nerve among the Sisters. The possibility, even remote, that they might arouse another Kwisatz Haderach sent shudders of angry fear through the ranks. To meddle with the worm-bound remnants of the Tyrant! That was dangerous in the extreme.\n“We should never take that ghola to Rakis,” Schwangyu muttered. “Let sleeping worms lie.”\nLucilla gave her attention once more to the ghola-child. He had turned his back on the high parapet with its two Reverend Mothers, but something about his posture said he knew they discussed him and he awaited their response.\n“You doubtless realize that you have been called in while he is yet too young,” Schwangyu said.\n“| have never heard of the deep imprinting on one that young,” Lucilla agreed. She allowed something softly self- mocking in her tone, a thing she knew Schwangyu would hear and misinterpret. The management of procreation and all of its attendant necessities, that was the Bene Gesserit\nultimate specialty. Use love but avoid it, Schwangyu would be thinking now. The Sisterhood’s analysts knew the roots of love. They had examined this quite early in their development but had never dared breed it out of those they influenced. Tolerate love but guard against it, that was the rule. Know that it lay deep within the human genetic makeup, a safety net to insure continuation of the species. You used it where necessary, imprinting selected individuals (Sometimes upon each other) for the Sisterhood’s purposes, knowing then that such individuals would be linked by powerful bonding lines not readily available to the common awareness. Others might observe such links and plot the consequences but the linked ones would dance to unconscious music.\n“I was not suggesting that it’s a mistake to imprint him,” Schwangyu said, misreading Lucilla’s silence.\n“We do what we are ordered to do,” Lucilla chided. Let Schwangyu make of that what she would.\n“Then you do not object to taking the ghola to Rakis,” Schwangyu said. “I wonder if you would continue such unquestioning obedience if you knew the full story?”\nLucilla inhaled a deep breath. Was the entire design for the Duncan Idaho gholas to be shared with her now?\n“There is a female child named Sheeana Brugh on Rakis,” Schwangyu said. “She can control the giant worms.”\nLucilla concealed her alertness. Giant worms. Not Shai- hulud. Not Shaitan. Giant worms. The sandrider predicted by the Tyrant had appeared at last!\n“I do not make idle chatter,” Schwangyu said when Lucilla continued silent.\nIndeed not, Lucilla thought. And you call a thing by its descriptive label, not by the name of its mystical import. Giant worms. And you're really thinking about the Tyrant, Leto II, whose endless dream is carried as a pearl of awareness in each of those worms. Or so we are led to believe.\nSchwangyu nodded toward the child on the lawn below them. “Do you think their ghola will be able to influence the girl who controls the worms?”\nWe’re peeling away the skin at last, Lucilla thought. She said: “I have no need for the answer to such a question.”\n“You are a cautious one,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla arched her back and stretched. Cautious? Yes, indeed! Taraza had warned her: “Where Schwangyu is concerned, you must act with extreme caution but with speed. We have a very narrow window of time within which we can succeed.”\nSucceed at what? Lucilla wondered. She glanced sideways at Schwangyu. “I", " label, not by the name of its mystical import. Giant worms. And you're really thinking about the Tyrant, Leto II, whose endless dream is carried as a pearl of awareness in each of those worms. Or so we are led to believe.\nSchwangyu nodded toward the child on the lawn below them. “Do you think their ghola will be able to influence the girl who controls the worms?”\nWe’re peeling away the skin at last, Lucilla thought. She said: “I have no need for the answer to such a question.”\n“You are a cautious one,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla arched her back and stretched. Cautious? Yes, indeed! Taraza had warned her: “Where Schwangyu is concerned, you must act with extreme caution but with speed. We have a very narrow window of time within which we can succeed.”\nSucceed at what? Lucilla wondered. She glanced sideways at Schwangyu. “I don’t see how the Tleilaxu could succeed in killing eleven of these gholas. How could they get through our defenses?”\n“We have the Bashar now,” Schwangyu said. “Perhaps he can prevent disaster.” Her tone said she did not believe this. Mother Superior Taraza had said: “You are the Imprinter, Lucilla. When you get to Gammu you will recognize some of the pattern. But for your task you have no need for the full\ndesign.”\n“Think of the cost!” Schwangyu said, glaring down at the ghola, who now squatted, pulling at tufts of grass.\nCost had nothing to do with it, Lucilla knew. The open admission of failure was much more important. The Sisterhood could not reveal its fallibility. But the fact that an Imprinter had been summoned early—that was vital. Taraza had known the Imprinter would see this and recognize part of the pattern.\nSchwangyu gestured with one bony hand at the child, who had returned to his solitary play, running and tumbling on the grass.\n“Politics,” Schwangyu said.\nNo doubt Sisterhood politics lay at the core of Schwangyu’s heresy, Lucilla thought. The delicacy of the internal argument could be deduced from the fact that\nSchwangyu had been put in charge of the Keep here on Gammu. Those who opposed Taraza refused to sit on the sidelines.\nSchwangyu turned and looked squarely at Lucilla. Enough had been said. Enough had been heard and screened through minds trained in Bene Gesserit awareness. The Chapter House had chosen this Lucilla with great care.\nLucilla felt the older woman’s careful examination but refused to let this touch that innermost sense of purpose upon which every Reverend Mother could rely in times of stress. Here. Let her look fully upon me. Lucilla turned and set her mouth in a soft smile, passing her gaze across the rooftop opposite them.\nA uniformed man armed with a heavy-duty lasgun appeared there, looked once at the two Reverend Mothers and then focused on the child below them.\n“Who is that?” Lucilla asked\n“Patrin, the Bashar’s most trusted aide. Says he’s only the Bashar’s batman but you'd have to be blind and a fool to believe that.”\nLucilla examined the man across from them with care. So that was Patrin. A native of Gammu, Taraza had said. Chosen for this task by the Bashar himself. Thin and blond, much too old now to be soldiering, but then the Bashar had been called back from retirement and had insisted Patrin must share this duty.\nSchwangyu noted the way Lucilla shifted her attention from Patrin to the ghola with real concern. Yes, if the Bashar had been called back to guard this Keep, then the ghola was in extreme peril.\nLucilla started in sudden surprise. “Why... he’s...”\n“Miles Teg’s orders,” Schwangyu said, naming the Bashar. “All of the ghola’s play is training play. Muscles are to be prepared for the day when he is restored to his original self.”\n“But that’s no simple exercise he’s doing down there,” Lucilla said. She felt her own muscles respond\nsympathetically to the remembered training.\n“We hold back only the Sisterhood’s arcana from this ghola,” Schwangyu said. “Almost anything else in our storehouse of knowledge can be his.” Her tone said she found this extremely objectionable.\n“Surely, no one believes this ghola could become another Kwisatz Haderach,” Lucilla objected.\nSchwangyu merely shrugged.\nLucilla held herself quite still, thinking. Was it possible the ghola could be transformed into a male version of a Reverend Mother? Could this Duncan Idaho learn to look inward where no Reverend Mother dared?\nSchwangyu began to speak, her voice almost a growling mutter: “The design of this project... they havea dangerous plan. They could make the same mistake .. .” She broke off.\nThey, Lucilla thought. Their ghola.\n“I would give anything to know for sure the position of Ix and the Fish Speakers in this,” Lucilla said.\n“Fish Speakers!” Schwangyu shook her head at the very thought of the remnant female army that had once served only the Tyrant. “They believe in truth and justice.”\nLucilla overcame a sudden tightness in her throat. Schwangyu had all but declared open opposition. Yet, she commanded here. The political rule was a simple one: Those who opposed the project must monitor it that they might abort it at the first sign of trouble. But that was a genuine Duncan Idaho ghola down there on the lawn. Cell comparisons and Truthsayers had confirmed it.\nTaraza had said: “You are to teach him love in all of its forms.”\n“He’s so young,” Lucilla said, keeping her attention on the ghola.\n“Young, yes,” Schwangyu said. “So, for now, | presume you will awaken his childish responses to maternal affection. Later...” Schwangyu shrugged.\nLucilla betrayed no emotional reaction. A Bene Gesserit obeyed. / am an /lmprinter. So... Taraza’s orders and the Imprinter’s specialized training defined a particular course of events.\nTo Schwangyu, Lucilla said: “There is someone who looks like me and speaks with my voice. | am Imprinting for her. May | ask who that is?”\n“No.”\nLucilla held her silence. She had not expected revelation but it had been remarked more than once that she bore a striking resemblance to Senior Security Mother Darwi Odrade. “A young Odrade.” Lucilla had heard this on several occasions. Both Lucilla and Odrade were, of course, in the Atreides line with a strong backbreeding from Siona descendants. The Fish Speakers had no monopoly on those genes! But the Other Memories of a Reverend Mother, even with their linear selectivity and confinement to the female side, provided important clues to the broad shape of the ghola project. Lucilla, who had come to depend on her experiences of the Jessica persona buried some five thousand years back in the Sisterhood’s genetic manipulations, felt a deep sense of dread from that source now. There was a familiar pattern here. It gave off such an intense feeling of doom that Lucilla fell automatically into the Litany Against Fear as she had been taught it in her first introduction to the Sisterhood’s rites:\n“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little- death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\nCalm returned to Lucilla.\nSchwangyu, sensing some of this, allowed her guard to drop slightly. Lucilla was no dullard, no specia/ Reverend Mother with an empty title and barely sufficient background to function without embarrassing the Sisterhood. Lucilla was\nthe real thing and some reactions could not be hidden from her, not even reactions of another Reverend Mother. Very well, let her know the full extent of the opposition to this foolish, this dangerous project!\n“I do not think their ghola will survive to see Rakis,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla let this pass. “Tell me about his friends,” she said.\n“He has no friends; only teachers.”\n“When will | meet them?” She kept her gaze on the opposite parapet where Patrin leaned idly against a low pillar, his heavy lasgun at the ready. Lucilla realized with an abrupt shock that Patrin was watching her. Patrin was a message from the Bashar! Schwangyu obviously saw and understood. We guard him!\n“| presume it’s Miles Teg you’re so anxious to meet,” Schwangyu said.\n“Among others.”\n“Don’t you want to make contact with the ghola first?”\n“I’ve already made contact with him.” Lucilla nodded toward the enclosed yard where the child once more stood almost motionless and looking up at her. “He’s a thoughtful one.”\n“I’ve only the reports on the others,” Schwangyu said, “but | suspect this is the most thoughtful one of the series.”\nLucilla suppressed an involuntary shudder at the readiness for violent opposition in Schwangyu’s words and attitude. There was not one hint that the child below them shared a common humanity.\nWhile Lucilla was thinking this, clouds covered the sun as they often did here at this hour. A cold wind blew in over the Keep’s walls, swirling around the courtyard. The child turned away and picked up the speed of his exercises, getting his warmth from increased activity.\n“Where does he go to be alone?” Lucilla asked.\n“Mostly to his room. He has tried a few dangerous escapades, but we have discouraged this.”\n“He must hate us very much.”\n“I’m sure of it.”\n“I will have to deal with that directly.”\n“Surely, an Imprinter has no doubts about her ability to overcome hate.”\n“I was thinking of Geasa.” Lucilla sent a knowing look at Schwangyu. “I find it astonishing that you let Geasa make such a mistake.”\n“| don’t interfere with the normal progress of the ghola’s instructions. If one of his teachers develops a real affection for him, that is not my problem.”\n“An attractive child,” Lucilla said.\nThey stood a bit longer watching the Duncan Idaho ghola at his training-play. Both Reverend Mothers thought briefly of Geasa, one of the first teachers brought here for the ghola project. Schwangyu’s attitude was plain: Geasa was a providential failure. Lucilla thought only: Schwangyu and Geasa complicated my task. Neither woman gave even a passing moment to the way these thoughts reaffirmed their loyalties.\nAs she watched the child in the courtyard, Lucilla began to have a new appreciation of what the Tyrant God Emperor had actually achieved. Leto II had employed this ghola-type through uncounted lifetimes—some thirty-five hundred years of them, one after another. And the God Emperor Leto Il had been no ordinary force of nature. He had been the biggest juggernaut in human history, rolling over everything: over social systems, over natural and unnatural hatreds, over governmental forms, over rituals (both taboo and mandatory), over religions casual and religions intense. The crushing weight of the Tyrant’s passage had left nothing unmarked, not even the Bene Gesserit.\nLeto Il had called it “The Golden Path” and this Duncan Idaho-type ghola below her now had figured prominently in that awesome passage. Lucilla had studied the Bene Gesserit accounts, probably the best in the universe. Even\ntoday on most of the old Imperial Planets, newly married couples still scattered dollops of water east and west, mouthing", " have a new appreciation of what the Tyrant God Emperor had actually achieved.

Even\ntoday on most of the old Imperial Planets, newly married couples still scattered dollops of water east and west, mouthing the local version of “Let Thy blessings flow back to us from this offering, O God of Infinite Power and Infinite Mercy.”\nOnce, it had been the task of Fish Speakers and their tame priesthood to enforce such obeisance. But the thing had developed its own momentum, becoming a pervasive compulsion. Even the most doubting of believers said: “Well, it can do no harm.” It was an accomplishment that the finest religious engineers of the Bene Gesserit Missionaria Protectiva admired with frustrated awe. The Tyrant had surpassed the Bene Gesserit best. And fifteen hundred years since the Tyrant’s death, the Sisterhood remained powerless to unlock the central knot of that fearsome accomplishment.\n“Who has charge of the child’s religious training?” Lucilla asked.\n“No one,” Schwangyu said. “Why bother? If he is reawakened to his original memories, he will have his own ideas. We will deal with those if we ever have to.”\nThe child below them completed his allotted training time. Without another look up at the watchers on the parapet, he left the enclosed yard and entered a wide doorway on the left. Patrin, too, abandoned his guard position without glancing at the two Reverend Mothers.\n“Don’t be fooled by Teg’s people,” Schwangyu said. “They have eyes in the backs of their heads. Teg’s birth-mother, you know, was one of us. He is teaching that ghola things better never shared!”\nExplosions are also compressions of time.

The long aba robe that encased her in shimmering black from shoulders to floor did not completely conceal the grace with which her body expressed every movement.\nTaraza leaned forward in her chairdog and scanned the Records Relay projecting its condensed Bene Gesserit glyphs above the tabletop for her eyes only.\n“Darwi Odrade,” the display identified the standing woman, and then came the essential biography, which Taraza already knew in detail. The display served several purposes—it provided a secure reminder for the Mother Superior, it allowed an occasional delay for thought while she appeared to scan the records, and it was a final argument should something negative arise from this interview.\nOdrade had borne nineteen children for the Bene Gesserit, Taraza observed as the information scrolled past her eyes. Each child by a different father. Not much unusual about that, but even the most searching gaze could see that this essential service to the Sisterhood had not grossened Odrade’s flesh. Her features conveyed a natural hauteur in\nthe long nose and the complementary angular cheeks. Every feature focused downward to a narrow chin. Her mouth, though, was full and promised a passion that she was Careful to bridle.\nWe can always depend on the Atreides genes, Taraza thought.\nA window curtain fluttered behind Odrade and she glanced back at it. They were in Taraza’s morning room, a small and elegantly furnished space decorated in shades of green. Only the stark white of Taraza’s chairdog separated her from the background. The room’s bow windows looked eastward onto garden and lawn with faraway snowy mountains of Chapter House Planet as backdrop.\nWithout looking up, Taraza said: “I was glad when both you and Lucilla accepted the assignment. It makes my task much easier.”\n“I would like to have met this Lucilla,” Odrade said, looking down at the top of Taraza’s head. Odrade’s voice came out a soft contralto.\nTaraza cleared her throat. “No need. Lucilla is one of our finest Imprinters. Each of you, of course, received the identical liberal conditioning to prepare you for this.”\nThere was something almost insulting in Taraza’s casual tone and only the habits of long association put down Odrade’s immediate resentment. It was partly that word “liberal,” she realized. Atreides ancestors rose up in rebellion at the word. It was as though her accumulated female memories lashed out at the unconscious assumptions and unexamined prejudices behind the concept.\n“Only liberals really think. Only liberals are intellectual. Only liberals understand the needs of their fellows.”\nHow much viciousness lay concealed in that word! Odrade thought. How much secret ego demanding to feel Superior.\nOdrade reminded herself that Taraza, despite the casually insulting tone, had used the term only in its catholic sense: Lucilla’s generalized education had been carefully matched to that of Odrade.\nTaraza leaned back into a more comfortable position but still kept her attention on the display in front of her. The light from the eastern windows fell directly on her face, leaving shadows beneath nose and chin. A small woman just a bit older than Odrade, Taraza retained much of the beauty that had made her a most reliable breeder with difficult sires. Her face was a long oval with soft curved cheeks. She wore her black hair drawn back tightly from a high forehead with a pronounced peak. Taraza’s mouth opened minimally when she spoke: superb control of movement. An observer’s attention tended to focus on her eyes: that compelling blue- in-blue. The total effect was of a suave facial mask from which little escaped to betray her true emotions.\nOdrade recognized this present pose in the Mother Superior. Taraza would mutter to herself presently. Indeed, right on cue, Taraza muttered to herself.\nThe Mother Superior was thinking while she followed the biographical display with great attention. Many matters occupied her attention.\nThis was a reassuring thought to Odrade. Taraza did not believe there was any such thing as a beneficent power guarding humankind. The Missionaria Protectiva and the intentions of the Sisterhood counted for everything in Taraza’s universe. Whatever served those intentions, even the machinations of the long-dead Tyrant, could be judged good. All else was evil. Alien intrusions from the Scattering— especially those returning descendants who called themselves “Honored Matres”—were not to be trusted. Taraza’s own people, even those Reverend Mothers who opposed her in Council, were the ultimate Bene Gesserit resource, the only thing that could be trusted.\nStill without looking up, Taraza said: “Do you know that when you compare the millennia preceding the Tyrant with those after his death, the decrease in major conflicts is phenomenal. Since the Tyrant, the number of such conflicts has dropped to less than two percent of what it was before.”\n“As far as we know,” Odrade said.\nTaraza’s gaze flicked upward and then down. “What?” “We have no way of telling how many wars have been fought outside our ken. Have you statistics from the people\nof the Scattering?”\n“Of course not!”\n“Leto tamed us is what you’re saying,” Odrade said.\n“If you care to put it that way.” Taraza inserted a marker in something she saw on her display.\n“Shouldn’t some of the credit go to our beloved Bashar Miles Teg?” Odrade asked. “Or to his talented predecessors?”\n“We chose those people,” Taraza said.\n“| don’t see the pertinence of this martial discussion,” Odrade said. “What does it have to do with our present problem?”\n“There are some who think we may revert to the pre- Tyrant condition with a very nasty bang.”\n“Oh?” Odrade pursed her lips.\n“Several groups among our returning Lost Ones are selling arms to anyone who wants to or can buy.”\n“Specifics?” Odrade asked.\n“Sophisticated arms are flooding onto Gammu and there can be little doubt the Tleilaxu are stockpiling some of the nastier weapons.”\nTaraza leaned back and rubbed her temples. She spoke in a low, almost musing voice. “We think we make decisions of the greatest moment and out of the very highest principles.”\nOdrade had seen this before, too. She said: “Does the Mother Superior doubt the rightness of the Bene Gesserit?”\n“Doubt? Oh, no. But | do experience frustration. We work all of our lives for these highly refined goals and in the end, what do we find? We find that many of the things to which we have dedicated our lives came from petty decisions. They can be traced to desires for personal comfort or convenience and had nothing at all to do with our high ideals. What really was at stake was some worldly working agreement that satisfied the needs of those who could make the decisions.”\n“I’ve heard you call that political necessity,” Odrade said.\nTaraza spoke with tight control while returning her attention to the display in front of her. “If we become institutionalized in our judgments, that’s a sure way to extinguish the Bene Gesserit.”\n“You will not find petty decisions in my bio,” Odrade said.\n“I look for sources of weakness, for flaws.”\n“You won't find those, either.”\nTaraza concealed a smile. She recognized this egocentric remark: Odrade’s way of needling the Mother Superior. Odrade was very good at seeming to be impatient while actually suspending herself in a timeless flow of patience.\nWhen Taraza did not rise to the bait, Odrade resumed her calm waiting—easy breaths, the mind steady. Patience came without thinking of it. The Sisterhood had taught her long ago how to divide past and present into simultaneous flowings. While observing her immediate surroundings, she could pick up bits and pieces of her past and live through them as though they moved across a screen superimposed over the present.\nMemory work, Odrade thought. Necessary things to haul out and lay to rest. Removing the barriers. When all else palled, there was still her tangled childhood.\nThere had been a time when Odrade lived as most children lived: in a house with a man and woman who, if not her parents, certainly acted in loco parentis. All of the other children she knew then lived in similar situations. They had\npapas and mamas. Sometimes only papa worked away from home. Sometimes only mama went out to her labors. In Odrade’s case, the woman remained at home and no crèche nurse guarded the child in the working hours. Much later, Odrade learned that her birth-mother had given a large sum of money to provide this for the infant female hidden in plain sight that way.\n“She hid you with us because she loved you,” the woman explained when Odrade was old enough to understand. “That is why you must never reveal that we are not your real"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_d552dc2a8fe8e0224277ca8d1659ca396b9874706105c20a0e3481abd1a4a233_v2"}
