\n　　润生把这些家具扛到车厢上放好，就让红梅抱着孩子坐在驾驶楼里。 \n　　马达很有气魄地轰鸣起来。 \n　　他熟练地驾驶着汽车离开公路，转到河湾里，然后往斜对面的沟里开去——沟道里的路面刚刚能溜过一辆卡车！ \n　　太阳从山背后落下去了。润生打开车灯，小心翼翼地驾驶着。红梅抱着孩子，一句话也不说，静静地坐在他旁边，不时扭过脸又惊讶又佩服地在看他……汽车在村子下边的小河岸上停下来，天已经麻麻糊糊，村里有些人家的窗户上亮起了灯光。 \n　　润生帮助红梅把灶具搬到她家里。红梅要留他吃一顿饭——她已经把饺子馅和面团都准备下了。 \n　　润生推托不过，只好留下来。他看见，红梅的窑里不搁什么东西——显然是一个穷家。直到现在，他仍然不了解红梅为什么落到了这个地步！ \n　　他大方地和她一块包饺子。两个人说了许多当年学校和班里的事情。红梅还向他询问了其他一些同学近几年的情况——润生知道的也不多。不过，她避而不提孙少平和顾养民。 \n　　吃完饭后，红梅抱起孩子，又一直把他送到小河岸边的汽车上…… \n　　田润生在夜里才回到了原西县城。 \n　　他把汽车搁在停车场，先没去给姐夫打个招呼，就带着一种说不出的情绪走到街上一个私人开的小饭铺里。他要了二两烧酒和一碟咸花生豆，一个人慢慢喝起来。几杯酒下肚，他的五脏六腑都好象着了火。这是他第一次破例喝酒。小伙子！看来以后你不仅是你姐夫的助手，也将是他的酒伴了。 \n                  第38章\n　　田润生走后，郝红梅把孩子哄着，她自己也跟着躺在了一片孤寂的黑暗中。 \n　　往常这个时候，她还要门里门外忙着干活。但今天她无心再做这一切了。她感到四肢无力，浑身软绵绵的；更主要的是，她心里烦乱不堪！ \n　　她躺在自己的小土炕上，任凭眼泪在脸上不断线地流淌。今天她突然碰见过去班上的同学，使她本来麻木的神经受到了刺激，便忍不住又一次回溯起了往事——那一切似乎都已经很遥远了…… \n　　高中毕业以后，郝红梅和所有农村学生一样，回到了村子里。临毕业时因为贫穷和虚荣，她曾在原西城百货二门市干了那件蠢事——几块手帕几乎就断送了她的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>润生<|>PERSON<|>润生 is a
