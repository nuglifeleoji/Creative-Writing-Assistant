叶文洁终于还是没有做出一个天体物理学家的回答，她只是说：“它们都很远很远，掉不下来的。”\n     大凤对这回答已经很满意，又埋头做起针线活儿来。但叶文法却心绪起伏，她放下书，躺到温暖的炕面上，微闭着双眼，在想象中隐去这间小屋周围的整个字宙，就像油灯将小屋中的大部分隐没于黑暗中一样。然后，她将大凤心中的宇宙置换过来。这时，夜空是一个黑色的巨大球面，大小正好把世界扣在其中，球面上镶着无数的星星，晶莹地发着银光，每个都不比床边旧木桌上的那面圆镜子大。世界是平的，向各个方向延伸到很远很远，但总是有边的。这个大平面上布满了大兴安岭这样的山脉，也布满了森林，林间点缀着一个个像齐家屯一样的村庄……这个玩具盒般的宇宙令她感到分外舒适，渐渐地这宇宙由想象变成了梦乡。\n     在这个大兴安岭深处的小山村里，叶文洁心中的什么东西渐渐融化了，在她心灵的冰原上，融出了小小的一汪清澈的湖泊。\n     杨冬出生后，在红岸基地，时间在紧张和平静中又过去了两年多。这时，叶文洁接到了通知，她和父亲的案件都被彻底平反；不久之后又收到了母校的信；说她可以立刻回去工作。与信同来的还有一大笔汇款，这是父亲落实政策后补发的工资。在基地会议上，领导终于称她为叶文洁同志了。\n     叶文洁很平静地面对这一切，没有激动和兴奋。她对外面的世界不感兴趣，宁愿一直在僻静的红岸基地待下去，但为了孩子的教育，她还是离开了本以为要度过一生的红岸基地，返回了母校。\n     走出深山，叶文洁充满了春天的感觉，“文革”的严冬确实结束了，一切都在复苏之中。虽然浩劫刚刚结束，举目望去一片废墟，无数人在默默地舔着自己的伤口，但在人们眼中，未来新生活的曙光已经显现。大学中出现了带着孩子的学生，书店中文学名著被抢购一空，工厂中的技术革新成了一件最了不起的事情，科学研究更是被罩上了一层神圣的光环。科学和技术一时成了打开未来之门的唯一钥匙，人们像小学生那样真诚地接近科学，他们的奋斗虽是天真的，但也是脚踏实地的。在第一次全国科学大会上，郭沫若宣布科学的春天到来了。\n     这是疯狂的终结吗？科学和理智开始回归了？叶文洁不止一次地问自己。\n     直到离开红岸基地，叶文洁再也没有收到来自三体世界的消息。她知道，要想收到那个世界对她\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
