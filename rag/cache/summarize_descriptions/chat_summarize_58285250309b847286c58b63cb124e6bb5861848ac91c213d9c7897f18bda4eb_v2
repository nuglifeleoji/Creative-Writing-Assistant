Her works, including the *Manual of Muad'Dib*, serve as a comprehensive record of his early life, rise to power, and the profound impact he had on the universe. Through her writings, she captured Muad'Dib's sayings, providing insight into his philosophy and the prophetic nature of his rule.  \n\nIrulan's accounts offer historical perspective on Muad'Dib's transformation from a noble heir to a messianic figure, analyzing the implications of his prophecy and its far-reaching consequences. Her reflections delve into the complexities of his leadership, blending factual documentation with contemplative analysis. While her works are not without bias—given her personal and political ties—they remain a vital source for understanding Muad'Dib's influence.  \n\nIn summary, Princess Irulan's writings consolidate Muad'Dib's legacy, preserving his words, deeds, and the broader significance of his reign for future generations.
