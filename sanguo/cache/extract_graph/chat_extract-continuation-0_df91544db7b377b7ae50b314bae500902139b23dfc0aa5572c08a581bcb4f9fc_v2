�来迎。二将斗了四五十合，不分胜负。曹操见了，暗暗称奇。许褚挥刀纵马，直出助战。高览挺枪接住。四员将捉对儿厮杀。曹操令夏侯惇、曹洪，各引三千军，齐冲彼阵。审配见曹军来冲阵，便令放起号炮：两下万弩并发，中军内弓箭手一齐拥出阵前乱射。曹军如何抵敌，望南急走。袁绍驱兵掩杀，曹军大败，尽退至官渡。袁绍移军逼近官渡下寨。审配曰：“今可拨兵十万守官渡，就曹操寨前筑起土山，令军人下视寨中放箭。操若弃此而去，吾得此隘口，许昌可破矣。”绍从之，于各寨内选精壮军人，用铁锹土担，齐来曹操寨边，垒土成山。曹营内见袁军堆筑土山，欲待出去冲突，被审配弓弩手当住咽喉要路，不能前进。十日之内，筑成土山五十余座，上立高橹，分拨弓弩手于其上射箭。曹军大惧，皆顶着遮箭牌守御。土山上一声梆子响处，箭下如雨。曹军皆蒙楯伏地，袁军呐喊而笑。\n\n    曹操见军慌乱，集众谋士问计。刘晔进曰：“可作发石车以破之。”操令晔进车式，连夜造发石车数百乘，分布营墙内，正对着土山上云梯。候弓箭手射箭时，营内一齐拽动石车，炮石飞空，往上乱打。人无躲处，弓箭手死者无数。袁军皆号其车为“霹雳车”。由是袁军不敢登高射箭。审配又献一计：令军人用铁锹暗打地道，直透曹营内，号为“掘子军”。曹兵望见袁军于山后掘土坑，报知曹操。操又问计于刘晔。晔曰：“此袁军不能攻明而攻暗，发掘伏道，欲从地下透营而入耳。”操曰：“何以御之？”晔曰：“可绕营掘长堑，则彼伏道无用也。”操连夜差军掘堑。袁军掘伏道到堑边，果不能入，空费军力。\n\n    却说曹操守官渡，自八月起，至九月终，军力渐乏，粮草不继。意欲弃官渡退回许昌，迟疑未决，乃作书遣人赴许昌问荀彧。彧以书报之。书略曰：“承尊命，使决进退之疑。愚以袁绍悉众聚于官渡，欲与明公决胜负，公以至弱当至强，若不能制，必为所乘：是天下之大机也。绍军虽众，而不能用；以公之神武明哲，何向而不济！今军实虽少，未若楚、汉在荥阳、成皋间也。公今画地而守，扼其喉而使不能进，情见势竭，必将有变。此用奇之时，断不可失。惟明公裁察焉。”\n######################\nOutput:",
