言未已，一人昂然而进曰：“傅公悌、蒯异度之言甚善，何不从之？”众视之，乃山阳高平人，姓王，名粲，字仲宣。粲容貌瘦弱，身材短小；幼时往见中郎蔡邕，时邕高朋满座，闻粲至，倒履迎之。宾客皆惊曰：“蔡中郎何独敬此小子耶？”邕曰：“此子有异才，吾不如也。”粲博闻强记，人皆不及：尝观道旁碑文一过，便能记诵；观人弈棋，棋局乱，粲复为摆出，不差一子。又善算术。其文词妙绝一时。年十七，辟为黄门侍郎，不就。后因避乱至荆襄，刘表以为上宾。当日谓刘琮曰：“将军自料比曹公何如？”琮曰：“不如也。”粲曰：“曹公兵强将勇，足智多谋；擒吕布于下邳，摧袁绍于官渡，逐刘备于陇右，破乌桓于白狼：枭除荡定者，不可胜计。今以大军南下荆襄，势难抵敌。傅、蒯二君之谋，乃长策也。将军不可迟疑，致生后悔。”琮曰：“先生见教极是。但须禀告母亲知道。”只见蔡夫人从屏后转出，谓琮曰：“既是仲宣、公悌、异度三人所见相同，何必告我。”于是刘琮意决，便写降书，令宋忠潜地往曹操军前投献。宋忠领命，直至宛城，接着曹操，献上降书。操大喜，重赏宋忠，分付教刘琮出城迎接，便着他永为荆州之主。\n\n    宋忠拜辞曹操，取路回荆襄。将欲渡江，忽见一枝人马到来，视之，乃关云长也。宋忠回避不迭，被云长唤住，细问荆州之事。忠初时隐讳；后被云长盘问不过，只得将前后事情，——实告。云长大惊，随捉宋忠至新野见玄德，备言其事。玄德闻之大哭。张飞曰：“事已如此，可先斩宋忠，随起兵渡江，夺了襄阳，杀了蔡氏、刘琮，然后与曹操交战。”玄德曰：“你且缄口。我自有斟酌。”乃叱宋忠曰：“你知众人作事，何不早来报我？今虽斩汝无益于事。可速去。”忠拜谢，抱头鼠窜而去。玄德正忧闷间，忽报公子刘琦差伊籍到来。玄德感伊籍昔日相救之恩，降阶迎之，再三称谢。籍曰：“大公子在江夏，闻荆州已故，蔡夫人与蔡瑁等商议，不来报丧，竟立刘琮为主。公子差人往襄阳探\n######################\nOutput:",
