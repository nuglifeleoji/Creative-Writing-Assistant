This sociopolitical movement was initiated by Mao Zedong, aiming to preserve Chinese communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society. The Cultural Revolution led to widespread turmoil and trauma, profoundly affecting the lives of many individuals, including notable characters such as 绍琳 and 叶文洁.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, the Cultural Revolution marked a time of intense political upheaval, where millions were persecuted, and societal norms were drastically altered. The movement sought to enforce communist ideology and eliminate perceived threats to Mao's vision, resulting in the disruption of education, the economy, and cultural institutions. Many people faced severe consequences, including imprisonment, public humiliation, and even death, as the Red Guards, a mass paramilitary social movement, targeted intellectuals, professionals, and anyone deemed counter-revolutionary.\n\nThe impact of the Cultural Revolution extended beyond individual suffering; it reshaped the social and cultural landscape of China. The movement led to the destruction of cultural heritage, as historical artifacts and sites were vandalized or demolished in the name of revolutionary zeal. The period is characterized by a significant shift in societal values, where loyalty to the Communist Party was prioritized over traditional familial and cultural ties.\n\nIn literature and historical accounts, the Cultural Revolution is often depicted as a time of chaos and change, reflecting the struggles and resilience of those who lived through it. Characters like 绍琳 and 叶文洁 symbolize the broader experiences of individuals caught in the crossfire of ideological battles, showcasing the personal and collective trauma that resulted from this era.\n\nOverall, the Cultural Revolution remains a pivotal chapter in Chinese history, with lasting effects on the country's political, social, and cultural fabric. It serves as a reminder of the complexities of revolutionary movements and their capacity to alter the course of history, leaving an indelible mark on the lives of those who experienced its profound challenges and transformations.\",7\r\n531,红岸项目,红岸项目是一个旨在探索外星文明的科研项目，曾经是国内最大的射电天文观测基地。,5\r\n120,程代表,程代表是叶文洁的幻觉中的一个人物，象征着她的家庭和过去。,3\r\n124,杨卫宁,\"杨卫宁 is a multifaceted character deeply intertwined with 叶文洁, both personally and professionally. He is portrayed as a talented engineer and the chief engineer at the Red Coast Base, where he plays a pivotal role in the 红岸工程 (Red Coast Project). His expertise lies in solar electromagnetic radiation, and he is known for his solid foundation in mathematics and quick thinking. Throughout his career, 杨卫宁 has navigated complex relationships, including a challenging dynamic with his mentor during graduate studies.\n\nIn his professional capacity, 杨卫宁 is involved in critical discussions regarding the feasibility of solar experiments, collaborating with 叶文洁 and 雷志成. He is also responsible for communicating important decisions related to the project to 叶文洁, demonstrating his significant influence within the team. Despite his professional demeanor, he harbors deep feelings for 叶文洁, supporting her research endeavors and guiding her through pivotal decisions about her future.\n\nTheir relationship is characterized by a blend of personal affection and professional collaboration. 杨卫宁 is not only 叶文洁's husband but also a dedicated partner who has made sacrifices for their love, including giving up his own career aspirations due to the political environment surrounding them. His commitment to 叶文洁 is evident, as he is portrayed as someone who genuinely loves her and supports her work, even as he grapples with the implications of their circumstances.\n\nTragically, 杨卫宁's life is cut short due to an accident, marking him as a victim in a murder case that adds a layer of complexity to his character. His role at the Red Coast Base also includes responsibilities such as receiving 叶文洁 and arranging her accommodations, further emphasizing his supportive nature.\n\nDespite his affection for 叶文洁, 杨卫宁's professional interactions reveal a more cautious side.
