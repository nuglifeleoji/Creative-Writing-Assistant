As a loyal soldier serving House Harkonnen, CZIGO is tasked with assisting in the transportation of Jessica and Paul, showcasing his role as both a skilled pilot and a subordinate within the Harkonnen military hierarchy. However, his interactions with the Atreides take a hostile turn when he assumes the role of a guard, threatening Paul and Jessica during their captivity.

Ultimately, CZIGO is defeated by Paul, demonstrating the young Atreides' growing prowess in battle.  \n\nCZIGO's dual roles—as a pilot facilitating transport and as a guard enforcing Harkonnen authority—paint him as a versatile but ultimately antagonistic figure.
