He has developed a model of the universe, which he explains to another character, 汪淼, showcasing his deep understanding of cosmic principles.墨子 is portrayed as a confident individual, particularly in his belief regarding the sun's rising, which reflects his grasp of astronomical phenomena. He is actively engaged in the ambitious project of creating the world's first ten-thousand-year calendar, further indicating his extensive knowledge of the universe's workings.\n\nIn addition to his astronomical pursuits, 墨子 is recognized as a philosopher and the founder of Mohism, a school of thought that emphasizes utilitarianism and meritocracy. His philosophical contributions are significant, as they advocate for practical approaches to governance and social organization, contrasting with other philosophical traditions of his time.\n\n墨子 is also depicted as a thinker who conducts experiments and observations, demonstrating a scientific approach to understanding the world. However, his methods are not without criticism; the renowned scientist 伽利略 critiques 墨子’s experimental techniques, suggesting that there may be limitations or flaws in his approach to scientific inquiry.\n\nOverall, 墨子 embodies a blend of scientific inquiry and philosophical thought, making him a pivotal figure in both the realms of astronomy and ethics. His efforts to understand and explain the universe, alongside his contributions to philosophical discourse, position him as a significant character in the narrative.\",10\r\n375,宇宙,\"The universe, referred to as \"\"宇宙,\"\" is an immense and boundless expanse that encompasses all matter, energy, and dimensions. It is a setting for various cosmic phenomena and celestial bodies, including billions of stars and potentially intelligent civilizations. The universe serves as a backdrop for profound inquiries into existence and the moral implications of interactions between humanity and other intelligent life forms.\n\nWithin this vast space, the search for extraterrestrial civilizations is a significant focus, as researchers like Ye Wenjie explore the possibilities of communication with these entities. The universe is not only a physical realm but also a conceptual one, where philosophical questions arise regarding the nature of life and the ethical considerations of engaging with other intelligent beings.\n\nThe universe is characterized by its complexity and the myriad of phenomena that occur within it, including fluctuations and events that challenge our understanding of reality. It is a domain where the potential for discovery is limitless, as scientists and thinkers alike ponder the implications of their findings and the existence of other forms of life.\n\nIn summary, \"\"宇宙\"\" represents the vast, intricate space that contains all celestial bodies, energy, and matter, while also being a focal point for the exploration of intelligent life and the moral questions that arise from such interactions.\",17\r\n376,波动,The fluctuations refer to the observed changes in cosmic background radiation that are being analyzed by the characters.,1\r\n433,大铜球,The large copper sphere is a scientific instrument used for astronomical observations and theories about the universe.,1\r\n440,外层壳,The outer shell is part of 墨子’s universe model that simulates the external environment of the universe.,1\r\n441,内层壳,\"The inner shell is another component of 墨子’s universe model, which interacts with the outer shell.\",1\r\n434,火海,\"The \"\"火海,\"\" or \"\"fire sea,\"\" is a conceptual force that exists outside the universe, playing a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the universe model.

The fire sea is not merely a physical phenomenon but rather an abstract force that embodies the complexities of cosmic interactions, highlighting the interconnectedness of various elements within the universe.

The first model, developed by 墨子, is designed to simulate the workings of the universe and predict celestial events. This model emphasizes a theoretical framework that seeks to provide insights into the fundamental mechanics governing celestial bodies and their interactions.\n\nIn contrast, the second model presented by 汪淼 is grounded in observational data. This approach aims to explain the unpredictable movements of planets, focusing on empirical evidence gathered from astronomical observations. By analyzing real-world data, 汪淼's model seeks to address the complexities and irregularities observed in planetary motion, offering a more practical perspective on the dynamics of the universe.\n\nTogether, these models represent a synthesis of theoretical and empirical methodologies in the study of the universe. While 墨子’s model provides a foundational understanding of cosmic mechanics, 汪淼’s observational approach enhances the predictive capabilities of the universe model by incorporating real-time data and addressing anomalies in planetary behavior.
