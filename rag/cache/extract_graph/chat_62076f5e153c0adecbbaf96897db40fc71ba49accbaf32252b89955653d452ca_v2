But when the twitch came, | knew it. | had never felt such a thing before. | was surprised by it, too, because knowing it then, | knew it had been there all along. It was familiar. It was my Truthsense twitching.”\nShe thought she could feel Truthsense stirring within herself. The feeling of wonder in his voice aroused something.\n“It was mine then,” he said. “It belonged to me and | belonged to it. No separation ever again.”\n“How wonderful that must be.” Awe and envy in her voice.\n“No! Some of it | hate. Seeing some people this way is like seeing them eviscerated, their guts hanging out.”\n“That’s disgusting!”\n“Yes, but there are compensations, love. These are people you meet, people who are like beautiful flowers extended to you by an innocent child. Innocence. My own innocence responds and my Truthsense is strengthened. That is what you do for me, my love.”\nThe no-ship of the Honored Matres arrived at Gammu and they sent her down to the Landing Flat in the garbage lighter. It disgorged her beside the ship’s discards and excrement but she did not mind. Home! I’m home and Lampadas survives.\nThe Rabbi, however, did not share her enthusiasm.\nOnce more, they sat in his study, but now she felt more familiar with Other Memory, much more confident. He could see this.\n“You are even more like them than ever! It’s unclean.”\n“Rabbi, we all have unclean ancestors. | am fortunate in that | know some of mine.”\n“What is this? What are you saying?”\n“All of us are descendants of people who did nasty things, Rabbi. We don’t like to think of barbarians in our ancestry but they’re there.”\n“Such talk!”\n“Reverend Mothers can recall them all, Rabbi. Remember, it is the victors who breed. You understand?”\n“I’ve never heard you talk so boldly. What has happened to you, daughter?”\n“I survived, knowing that victory sometimes is achieved at a moral price.”\n“What is this? These are evil words.”\n“Evil? Barbarism is not even the proper word for some of the evil things our ancestors did. The ancestors of all of us, Rabbi.”\nShe saw she had hurt him and felt the cruelty of her own words but could not stop. How could he escape the truth of what she said? He was an honorable man.\nShe spoke more softly but her words cut him even deeper. “Rabbi, if you shared witness to some of the things Other Memory has forced me to know, you would come back seeking new words for evil. Some things our ancestors have done debase the worst label you could imagine.”\n“Rebecca... Rebecca ... I know necessities of...”\n“Don’t make excuses about ‘necessities of the times’! You, a Rabbi, know better. When are we without a moral sense? It’s just that sometimes we don’t listen.”\nHe put his hands over his face, rocking back and forth in the old chair. It creaked mournfully.\n“Rabbi, you | have always loved and respected. | went through the Agony for you. | shared Lampadas for you. Do not deny what | have learned from this.”\nHe lowered his hands. “I do not deny, daughter. But permit me my pain.”\n“Out of all these realizations, Rabbi, the thing | must deal with most immediately and without respite is that there are no innocents.”\n“Rebecca!”\n“Guilty may not be the right word, Rabbi, but our ancestors did things for which payment must be made.”\n“That | understand, Rebecca. It is a balance that—”\n“Don’t tell me you understand when | know you don’t.” She stood and glared down at him. “It’s not a balance book that you set aright. How far back would you go?”\n“Rebecca, | am your Rabbi. You must not talk this way, especially to me.”\n“The farther back you go, Rabbi, the worse the evil atrocities and higher the price. You cannot go back that far but | am forced to it.”\nTurning, she left him, ignoring the pleading in his voice, the painful way he said her name. As she closed the door, she heard him say: “What have we done? Israel, help her.”\nThe writing of history is largely a process of diversion. Most historical accounts distract attention from the secret influences behind great events.\n—THE BASHAR TEG\nhen left to his own devices, Idaho often explored his no-ship prison. So much to see and learn about this Ixian artifact. It was a cave of wonders.\nHe paused on this afternoon’s restless walk through his quarters and looked at the tiny comeyes built into the glittering surface of a doorway. They were watching him. He had the odd sensation of seeing himself through those prying eyes. What did the Sisters think when they looked at him? The blocky ghola-child from Gammu’s long-dead Keep had become a lanky man: dark skin and hair. The hair was longer than when he had entered this no-ship on the last day of Dune.\nBene Gesserit eyes peered below the skin. He was sure they suspected he was a Mentat and he feared how they might interpret that. How could a Mentat expect to hide the fact from Reverend Mothers indefinitely? Foolishness! He knew they already suspected him of Truthsay.\nHe waved at the comeyes and said: “I’m restless. | think lIl explore.”\nBellonda hated it when he took that jocular attitude toward surveillance. She did not like him to roam the ship. She did not try to hide it from him. He could see the unspoken question in her glowering features whenever she came to confront him: “/s he looking for a way to escape?”\nExactly what I’m doing, Bell, but not in the way you suspect.\nThe no-ship presented him with fixed limits: the exterior forcefield he could not penetrate, certain machinery areas where the drive (so he was told) had been temporarily disabled, guard quarters (he could see into some of them but not enter), the armory, the section reserved to the captive Tleilaxu, Scytale. He occasionally met Scytale at one of the barriers and they peered at each other across the silencing field that held them apart. Then there was the information barrier—sections of Shiprecords that would not respond to his questions, answers his warders would not give.\nWithin these limits lay a lifetime of things to see and learn, even the lifetime of some three hundred Standard Years he could reasonably expect.\nIf Honored Matres do not find us.\nIdaho saw himself as the game they sought, wanting him even more than they wanted the women of Chapterhouse. He had no illusions about what the hunters would do to him. They knew he was here. The men he trained in sexual bonding and sent out to plague the Honored Matres—those men taunted the hunters.\nWhen the Sisters learned of his Mentat ability they would know immediately that his mind carried the memories of more than one ghola lifetime. The original did not have that talent. They would suspect he was a latent Kwisatz Haderach. Look how they rationed his melange. They were clearly terrified of repeating the mistake they had made with Paul Atreides and his Tyrant son. Thirty-five hundred years of bondage!\nBut dealing with Murbella required Mentat awareness. He entered every encounter with her not expecting to achieve answers then or later. It was a typical Mentat approach: concentrate on the questions. Mentats accumulated questions the way others accumulated answers. Questions\ncreated their own patterns and systems. This produced the most important shapes. You looked at your universe through self-created patterns—all composed of images, words, and labels (everything temporary), all mingled in sensory impulses, that reflected off his internal constructs the way light bounced from bright surfaces.\nIdaho’s original Mentat instructor had formed the temporary words for that first tentative construct: “Watch for consistent movements against your internal screen.”\nFrom that first hesitant dip into Mentat powers, Idaho could trace the growth of a sensitivity to changes in his own observations, always becoming Mentat.\nBellonda was his most severe trial. He dreaded her penetrating gaze and slashing questions. Mentat probing Mentat. He met her forays delicately, with reserve and patience. Now, what are you after?\nAs if he didn’t know.\nHe wore patience as a mask. But fear came naturally and there was no harm in showing it. Bellonda did not hide her wish to see him dead.\nIdaho accepted the fact that soon the watchers would see only one possible source for the skills he was forced to use. A Mentat’s real skills lay in that mental construct they called “the great synthesis.” It required a patience that non-\nMentats did not even imagine possible. Mentat schools defined it as perseverance. You were a primitive tracker, able to read minuscule signs, tiny disturbances in the environment, and follow where these led. At the same time, you remained open to broad motions all around and within. This produced naivete, the basic Mentat posture, akin to that of Truthsayers but far more sweeping.\n“You are open to whatever the universe may do,” his first instructor had said. “Your mind is not a computer; it is a response-tool keyed to whatever your senses display.”\nIdaho always recognized when Bellonda’s senses were open. She stood there, gaze slightly withdrawn, and he\nknew few preconceptions cluttered her mind. His defense lay in her basic flaw: Opening the senses required an idealism that was foreign to Bellonda. She did not ask the best questions and he wondered at this. Would Odrade use a flawed Mentat? It went against her other performances.\n| seek the questions that form the best images.\nDoing this, you never thought of yourself as clever, that you had the formula to provide the solution. You remained as responsive to new questions as you did to new patterns. Testing, re-testing, shaping and re-shaping. A constant process, never stopping, never satisfied. It was your own private pavane, similar to that of other Mentats but it carried always your own unique posture and steps.\n“You are never truly a Mentat. That is why we call it ‘The Endless Goal.’” The words of his teachers were burned into his awareness.\nAs he accumulated observations of Bellonda, he came to appreciate a viewpoint of those great Mentat Masters who had taught him. “Reverend Mothers do not make the best Mentats.”\nNo Bene Gesserit appeared capable of completely removing herself from that binding absolute she achieved in the Spice Agony: loyalty to her Sisterhood.\nHis teachers had warned against absolutes. They created a serious flaw in a Mentat.\n“Everything you do, everything you sense and Say is experiment. No deduction final. Nothing stops until dead and perhaps not even then, because each life creates endless ripples. Induction bounces within and you sensitize yourself to it. Deduction conveys illusions of absolutes. Kick the truth and shatter it!”\nWhen Bellonda’s questions touched on the relationship between himself and Murbella, he saw vague emotional responses. Amusement? Jealousy? He could accept amusement (and even jealousy) about the compelling\nsexual demands of this mutual addiction. /s the ecstasy truly that great?\nHe wandered through his quarters this afternoon feeling displaced, as though newly here and not yet accepting these rooms as home. That is emotion talking to me.\nOver the years of his confinement, these quarters had taken on a lived-in appearance. This was his cave, the former supercargo suite: large rooms with slightly curved walls—bedroom, library-workroom, sitting room, a green- tiled bath with dry and wet cleansing systems, and a long practice\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_62076f5e153c0adecbbaf96897db40fc71ba49accbaf32252b89955653d452ca_v2"}
