the Church, our official reaction would have to be severe,” Alia said. “You understand that, don’t you?”\n“But he—”\n“I’ve heard him myself,” she said. “But this is a special case.”\n“He cannot be Muad’Dib, My Lady!”\nHow little you know! she thought. She said: “We cannot risk taking him in the open, harming him where others could see it. If another opportunity presents itself, of course.”\n“He’s always surrounded by crowds these days!”\n“Then | fear you must be patient. Of course, if you insist on defying me... .” She left the consequences hanging in the air, unspoken, but well understood. The Cadelam was ambitious, a shining career before him.\n“We didn’t mean defiance, My Lady.” The man had himself under control now. “We acted hastily; | can see that. Forgive us, but he—”\n“Nothing has happened; nothing to forgive,” she said, using the common Fremen formula. It was one of the many ways a tribe kept peace in its ranks, and this Cadelam was still Old Fremen enough to remember that. His family carried a long tradition of leadership. Guilt was the Naib’s whip, to be used sparingly. Fremen served best when free of guilt or resentment.\nHe showed his realization of her judgment by bowing his head, saying: “For the good of the tribe; | understand.”\n“Go refresh yourselves,” she said. “The procession begins in a few minutes.”\n“Yes, My Lady.” They bustled away, every movement revealing their relief at this escape.\nWithin Alia’s head a bass rumbled: “Ahhhhh, you handled that most adroitly. One or two of them still believe you desire The Preacher dead. They'll find a way.”\n“Shut up!” she hissed. “Shut up! | should never have listened to you! Look what you’ve done...”\n“Set you on the road to immortality,” the bass voice said.\nShe felt it echoing in her skull like a distant ache, thought: Where can I hide? There’s no place to go!\n“Ghanima’s knife is sharp,” the Baron said. “Remember that.”\nAlia blinked. Yes, that was something to remember. Ghanima’s knife was sharp. That knife might yet cut them out of their present predicament.\nIf you believe certain words, you believe their hidden arguments. When you believe something is right or wrong, true or false, you believe the assumptions in the words which express the arguments. Such assumptions are often full of holes, but remain most precious to the convinced.\n—THE OPEN-ENDED PROOF FROM THE PANOPLIA PROPHETICA\nieee mind floated in a stew of fierce odors. He recognized the heavy cinnamon of melange, the confined sweat of working bodies, the acridity of an uncapped deathstill, dust of many sorts with flint dominant. The odors formed a trail through dreamsand, created shapes of fog in a dead land. He knew these odors should tell him something, but part of him could not yet listen.\nThoughts like wraiths floated through his mind: /n this time | have no finished features; | am all of my ancestors. The sun setting into the sand is the sun setting into my soul. Once this multitude within me was great, but that’s ended. I’m Fremen and l'Il have a Fremen ending. The Golden Path is ended before it began. It’s nothing but a windblown trail. We Fremen knew all the tricks to conceal ourselves: we left no feces, no water, no tracks. ... Now, look at my trail vanish.\nA masculine voice spoke close to his ear: “I could kill you, Atreides. | could kill you, Atreides.” It was repeated over and over until it lost meaning, became a wordless thing carried within Leto’s dreaming, a litany of sorts: “I could kill you, Atreides.”\nLeto cleared his throat and felt the reality of this simple act shake his senses. His dry throat managed: “Who...”\nThe voice beside him said: “I’m an educated Fremen and I’ve killed my man. You took away our gods, Atreides. What do we care about your stinking Muad’Dib? Your god’s dead!”\nWas that a real Ouraba voice or another part of his dream? Leto opened his eyes, found himself unfettered on a hard couch. He looked upward at rock, dim glowglobes, an unmasked face staring down at him so close he could smell the breath with its familiar odors of a sietch diet. The face was Fremen; no mistaking the dark skin, those sharp features and water-wasted flesh. This was no fat city dweller. Here was a desert Fremen.\n“Lam Namri, father of Javid,” the Fremen said. “Do you know me now, Atreides?”\n“I know Javid,” Leto husked.\n“Yes, your family knows my son well. | am proud of him. You Atreides may know him even better soon.”\n“What...”\n“lam one of your schoolmasters, Atreides. | have only one function: | am the one who could kill you. I’d do it gladly. In this school, to graduate is to live; to fail is to be given into my hands.”\nLeto heard implacable sincerity in that voice. It chilled him. This was a human gom jabbar, a high-handed enemy to test his right of entrance into the human concourse. Leto sensed his grandmother's hand in this and, behind her, the faceless masses of the Bene Gesserit. He writhed at this thought.\n“Your education begins with me,” Namri said. “That is just. It is fitting. Because it could end with me. Listen to me carefully now. My every word carries your life in it. Everything about me holds your death within it.”\nLeto shot his glance around the room: rock walls, barren— only this couch, the dim glowglobes, and a dark passage behind Namri.\n“You will not get past me,” Namri said. And Leto believed him.\n“Why’re you doing this?” Leto asked.\n“That’s already been explained. Think what plans are in your head! You are here and you cannot put a future into your present condition. The two don’t go together: now and future. But if you really know your past, if you look backward and see where you've been, perhaps there'll be reason once more. If not, there will be your death.”\nLeto noted that Namri’s tone was not unkind, but it was firm and no denying the death in it.\nNamri rocked back on his heels, stared at the rock ceiling. “In olden times Fremen faced east at dawn. Fos, you know? That’s dawn in one of the old tongues.”\nBitter pride in his voice, Leto said: “I speak that tongue.”\n“You have not listened to me, then,” Namri said, and there was a knife edge in his voice. “Night was the time of chaos. Day was the time of order. That’s how it was in the time of that tongue you say you speak: darkness-disorder, light-order. We Fremen changed that. Eos was the light we distrusted. We preferred the light of a moon, or the stars. Light was too much order and that can be fatal. You see what you Eos-Atreides have done? Man is a creature of only that light which protects him. The sun was our enemy on Dune.” Namri brought his gaze down to Leto’s level. “What light do you prefer, Atreides?”\nBy Namri’s poised attitude, Leto sensed that this question carried deep weight. Would the man kill him if he failed to answer correctly? He might. Leto saw Namri’s hand resting quietly next to the polished hilt of a crysknife. A ring in the form of a magic tortoise glittered on the Fremen’s knife hand.\nLeto eased himself up onto his elbows, sent his mind questing into Fremen beliefs. They trusted the Law and loved to hear its lessons expounded in analogy, these old Fremen. The light of the moon?\n“| prefer... the light of Lisanu L’haqq,” Leto said, watching Namri for subtle revelations. The man seemed\ndisappointed, but his hand moved away from his knife. “It is the light of truth, the light of the perfect man in which the influence of al-Mutakallim can clearly be seen,” Leto continued. “What other light would a human prefer?”\n“You speak as one who recites, not one who believes,” Namri said.\nAnd Leto thought: / did recite. But he began to sense the drift of Namri’s thoughts, how his words were filtered through early training in the ancient riddle game. Thousands of these riddles went into Fremen training, and Leto had but to bend his attention upon this custom to find examples flooding his mind. “Challenge: Silence? Answer: The friend of the hunted.”\nNamri nodded to himself as though he shared this thought, said: “There is a cave which is the cave of life for Fremen. It is an actual cave which the desert has hidden. Shai-Hulud, the great-grandfather of all Fremen, sealed up that cave. My Uncle Ziamad told me about it and he never lied to me. There is such a cave.”\nLeto heard the challenging silence when Namri finished speaking. Cave of life? “My Uncle Stilgar also told me of that cave,” Leto said. “It was sealed to keep cowards from hiding there.”\nThe reflection of a glowglobe glittered in Namri’s Shadowed eyes. He asked: “Would you Atreides open that cave? You seek to control life through a ministry: your Central Ministry for Information, Augaf and Hajj. The Maulana in charge is called Kausar. He has come a long way from his family’s beginnings at the salt mines of Niazi. Tell me, Atreides, what is wrong with your ministry?”\nLeto sat up, aware now that he was fully into the riddle game with Namri and that the forfeit was death. The man gave every indication that he’d use that crysknife at the first wrong answer.\nNamri, recognizing this awareness in Leto, said: “Believe me, Atreides. | am the clod-crusher. | am the Iron Hammer.”\nNow Leto understood. Namri saw himself as Mirzabah, the lron Hammer with which the dead are beaten who cannot reply satisfactorily to the questions they must answer before entry into paradise.\nWhat was wrong with the central ministry which Alia and her priests had created?\nLeto thought of why he’d come into the desert, anda Small hope returned to him that the Golden Path might yet appear in his universe. What this Namri implied by his question was no more than the motive which had driven Muad’Dib’s own son into the desert.\n“God's it is to show the way,” Leto said.\nNamri’s chin jerked down and he stared sharply at Leto. “Can it be true that you believe this?” he demanded.\n“It’s why | am here,” Leto said.\n“To find the way?”\n“To find it for myself.” Leto put his feet over the edge of the cot. The rock floor was uncarpeted, cold. “The Priests created their ministry to hide the", ", the lron Hammer with which the dead are beaten who cannot reply satisfactorily to the questions they must answer before entry into paradise.\nWhat was wrong with the central ministry which Alia and her priests had created?\nLeto thought of why he’d come into the desert, anda Small hope returned to him that the Golden Path might yet appear in his universe.

The rock floor was uncarpeted, cold. “The Priests created their ministry to hide the way.”\n“You speak like a true rebel,” Namri said, and he rubbed the tortoise ring on his finger. “We shall see. Listen carefully once more. You know the high Shield Wall at Jalalud-Din? That Wall bears my family’s marks carved there in the first days. Javid, my son, has seen those marks. Abedi Jalal, my nephew, has seen them. Mujahid Shafqat of the Other Ones, he too has seen our marks. In the season of the storms near Sukkar, | came down with my friend Yakup Abad near that place. The winds were blistering hot like the whirlwinds from which we learned our dances. We did not take time to see the marks because a storm blocked the way. But when the storm passed we saw the vision of Thatta upon the blown sand. The face of Shakir Ali was there for a moment, looking down upon his city of tombs. The vision was gone in the instant, but we all saw it. Tell me, Atreides, where can | find that city of tombs?”\nThe whirlwinds from which we learned our dances, Leto thought. The vision of Thatta and Shakir Ali. These were the words of a Zensunni Wanderer, those who considered themselves to be the only true men of the desert.\nAnd Fremen were forbidden to have tombs.\n“The city of tombs is at the end of the path which all men follow,” Leto said. And he dredged up the Zensunni beatifics. “It is in a garden one thousand paces square. There is a fine entry corridor two hundred and thirty-three paces long and one hundred paces wide all paved with marble from ancient Jaipur. Therein dwells ar- Razzaq, he who provides food for all who ask. And on the Day of Reckoning, all who stand up and seek the city of tombs shall not find it. For it is written: That which you know in one world, you shall not find in another.”\n“Again you recite without belief,” Namri sneered. “But l'Il accept it for now because | think you know why you’re here.” A cold smile touched his lips. “I give you a provisional future, Atreides.”\nLeto studied the man warily. Was this another question in disguise?\n“Good!” Namri said. “Your awareness has been prepared. I’ve sunk home the barbs. One more thing, then. Have you heard that they use imitation stillsuits in the cities of far Kadrish?”\nAs Namri waited, Leto quested in his mind for a hidden meaning. /mitation stillsuits? They were worn on many planets. He said: “The foppish habits of Kadrish are an old story often repeated. The wise animal blends into its Surroundings.”\nNamri nodded slowly. Then: “The one who trapped you and brought you here will see you presently. Do not try to leave this place. It would be your death.” Arising as he spoke, Namri went out into the dark passage.\nFor a long time after he had gone, Leto stared into the passage. He could hear sounds out there, the quiet voices of\nmen on guard duty. Namri’s story of the mirage-vision stayed with Leto. It brought up the long desert crossing to this place. It no longer mattered whether this were Jacurutu/Fondak. Namri was not a smuggler. He was something much more potent. And the game Namri played smelled of the Lady Jessica; it stank of the Bene Gesserit. Leto sensed an enclosing peril in this realization. But that dark passage where Namri had gone was the only exit from this room. And outside lay a strange sietch—beyond that, the desert. The harsh severity of that desert, its ordered chaos with mirages and endless dunes, came over Leto as part of the trap in which he was caught. He could recross that sand, but where would flight take him? The thought was like stagnant water. It would not quench his thirst.\nBecause of the one-pointed Time awareness in which the conventional mind remains immersed, humans tend to think of everything ina sequential, word-oriented framework. This mental trap produces very short-term concepts of effectiveness and consequences, a condition of constant, unplanned response to crises.\n—LIET-KYNES THE ARRAKIS WORKBOOK\nords and movements simultaneous, Jessica reminded herself and she bent her thoughts to those necessary mental preparations for the coming encounter.\nThe hour was shortly after breakfast, the golden sun of Salusa Secundus just beginning to touch the far wall of the enclosed garden which she could see from her window. She had dressed herself carefully: the black hooded cloak of a Reverend Mother, but it carried the Atreides crest in gold worked into an embroidered ring around the hem and again at the cuff of each sleeve. Jessica arranged the drape of her garment carefully as she turned her back on the window, holding her left arm across her waist to present the Hawk motif of the crest.\nFarad’n noted the Atreides symbols, commenting on them as he entered, but he betrayed no anger or surprise. She detected subtle humor in his voice and wondered at it. She saw that he had clad himself in the grey leotard which she had suggested. He sat on the low green divan to which she directed him, relaxing with his right arm along the back.\nWhy do I trust her? he wondered. This is a Bene Gesserit witch!\nJessica, reading the thought in the contrast between his relaxed body and the expression on his face, smiled and\nsaid: “You trust me because you know our bargain is a good one, and you want what I can teach you.”\nShe saw the pinch of a scowl touch his brow, waved her left hand to calm him. “No, | don’t read minds. | read the face, the body, the mannerisms, tone of voice, set of arms. Anyone can do this once they learn the Bene Gesserit Way.’\n“And you will teach me?”\n“I’m sure you've studied the reports about us,” she said. “Is there anywhere a report that we fail to deliver on a direct promise?”\n“No reports, but...”\n“We survive in part by the complete confidence which people can have in our truthfulness. That has not changed.” “I find this reasonable,” he said. “I’m anxious to begin.”\n“I’m surprised you've never asked the Bene Gesserit for a teacher,” she said. “They would’ve leaped at the opportunity to put you in their debt.”\n“My mother would never listen to me when I urged her to do this,” he said. “But now. .. .” He shrugged, an eloquent comment on Wensicia’s banishment. “Shall we start?”\n“It would’ve been better to begin this when you were much younger,” Jessica said. “It'll be harder for you now, and it'll take much longer. You’ll have to begin by learning patience, extreme patience. | pray you'll not find it too high a price.”\n“Not for the reward you offer.”\nShe heard the sincerity, the pressure of expectations, and the touch of awe in his voice. These formed a place to begin. She said: “The art of patience, then—starting with some elementary prana-bindu exercises for the legs and arms, for your breathing. We'll leave the hands and fingers for later. Are you ready?”\nShe seated herself on a stool facing him.\nFarad’n nodded, holding an expectant expression on his face to conceal the sudden onset of fear. Tyekanik had warned him that there must be a trick in the Lady Jessica’s\nr\noffer, something brewed by the Sisterhood. “You cannot believe that she has abandoned them again or that they have abandoned her.” Farad’n had stopped the argument with an angry outburst for which he’d been immediately sorry. His emotional reaction had made him agree more quickly with Tyekanik’s precautions. Farad’n glanced at the corners of the room, the subtle gleam of jems in the coving. All that glittered was not jems: everything in this room would be recorded and good minds would review every nuance, every word, every movement.\nJessica smiled, noting the direction of his gaze, but not revealing that she knew where his attention had wandered. She said: “To learn patience in the Bene Gesserit Way, you must begin by recognizing the essential, raw instability of our universe. We call nature—meaning this totality in all of its manifestations—the Ultimate Non-Absolute. To free your vision and permit you to recognize this conditional nature’s changing ways, you will hold your two hands at arm’s length in front of you. Stare at your extended hands, first the palms and then the backs. Examine the fingers, front and back. Do it.”\nFarad’n complied, but he felt foolish. These were his own hands. He knew them.\n“Imagine your hands aging,” Jessica said. “They must grow very old in your eyes. Very, very old. Notice how dry the skin...”\n“My hands don’t change,” he said. He already could feel the muscles of his upper arms trembling.\n“Continue to stare at your hands. Make them old, as old as you can imagine. It may take time. But when you see them age, reverse the process. Make your hands young again—as young as you can make them. Strive to take them from infancy to great age at will, back and forth, back and forth.”\n“They don’t change!” he protested. His shoulders ached.\n“If you demand it of your senses, your hands will change,” she said. “Concentrate upon visualizing the flow of time which you desire: infancy to age, age to infancy. It may take you hours, days, months. But it can be achieved. Reversing that change-flow will teach you to see every system as something spinning in relative stability ... only relative.”\n“I thought I was learning patience.” She heard anger in his voice, an edge of frustration.\n“And relative stability,” she said. “This is the perspective which you create with your own belief, and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination. You’ve learned only a limited way of looking at the universe. Now you must make the universe your own creation. This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining.”\n“How long did you say it takes?”\n“Patience,” she reminded him.\nA spontaneous grin touched his lips. His eyes wavered toward her.\n“Look at your hands!” she snapped.\nThe grin vanished. His gaze jerked back to a fixated concentration upon his extended hands.\n“What do | do when my arms get tired?” he asked.\n“Stop talking and concentrate,” she said. “If you become too tired, stop. Return to it after", " every system as something spinning in relative stability ... only relative.”\n“I thought I was learning patience.” She heard anger in his voice, an edge of frustration.\n“And relative stability,” she said. “This is the perspective which you create with your own belief, and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination. You’ve learned only a limited way of looking at the universe. Now you must make the universe your own creation. This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining.”\n“How long did you say it takes?”\n“Patience,” she reminded him.\nA spontaneous grin touched his lips. His eyes wavered toward her.\n“Look at your hands!” she snapped.\nThe grin vanished. His gaze jerked back to a fixated concentration upon his extended hands.\n“What do | do when my arms get tired?” he asked.\n“Stop talking and concentrate,” she said. “If you become too tired, stop. Return to it after a few minutes of relaxation and exercise. You must persist in this until you succeed. At your present stage, this is more important than you could possibly realize. Learn this lesson or the others will not come.”\nFarad’n inhaled a deep breath, chewed his lips, stared at his hands. He turned them slowly: front, back, front, back. ... His shoulders trembled with fatigue. Front, back. ... Nothing changed.\nJessica arose, crossed to the only door.\nHe spoke without removing his attention from his hands. “Where are you going?”\n“You'll work better on this if you’re alone. l'Il return in about an hour. Patience.”\n“I know!”\nShe studied him a moment. How intent he looked. He reminded her with a heart-tugging abruptness of her own lost son. She permitted herself a sigh, said: “When | return l'Il give you the exercise lessons to relieve your muscles. Give it time. You’ll be astonished at what you can make your body and your senses do.”\nShe let herself out.\nThe omnipresent guards took up station three paces behind her as she strode down the hall. Their awe and fear were obvious. They were Sardaukar, thrice-warned of her prowess, raised on the stories of their defeat by the Fremen of Arrakis. This witch was a Fremen Reverend Mother, a Bene Gesserit and an Atreides.\nJessica, glancing back, saw their stern faces as a mile- post in her design. She turned away as she came to the stairs, went down them and through a short passage into the garden below her windows.\nNow if only Duncan and Gurney can do their parts, she thought as she felt the gravel of a pathway beneath her feet, saw the golden light filtered by greenery.\nYou will learn the integrated communication methods as you complete the next step in your mental education. This is a gestalten function which will overlay data paths in your awareness, resolving complexities and masses of input from the mentat index-catalogue techniques which you already have mastered. Your initial problem will be the breaking tensions arising from the divergent assembly of minutiae/data on specialized subjects. Be warned. Without mentat overlay integration, you can be immersed in the Babel Problem, which is the label we give to the omnipresent dangers of achieving wrong combinations from accurate information.\n—THE MENTAT HANDBOOK\nhe sound of fabrics rubbing together sent sparks of\nawareness through Leto. He was surprised that he had tuned his sensitivity to the point where he automatically identified the fabrics from their sound: the combination came from a Fremen robe rubbing against the coarse hangings of a door curtain. He turned toward the sound. It came from the passage where Namri had gone minutes before. As Leto turned, he saw his captor enter. It was the Same man who had taken him prisoner: the same dark strip of skin above the stillsuit mask, the identical searing eyes. The man lifted a hand to his mask, slipped the catchtube from his nostrils, lowered the mask and, in the same motion, flipped his hood back. Even before he focused on the scar of the inkvine whip along the man’s jaw, Leto recognized him. The recognition was a totality in his awareness with the search for confirming details coming afterward. No mistake about it, this rolling lump of humanity, this warrior- troubadour, was Gurney Halleck!\nLeto clenched his hands into fists, overcome momentarily\nby the shock of recognition. No Atreides retainer had ever\nbeen more loyal. None better at shield fighting. He’d been Paul’s trusted confidant and teacher.\nHe was the Lady Jessica’s servant.\nThese recognitions and more surged through Leto’s mind. Gurney was his captor. Gurney and Namri were in this conspiracy together. And Jessica’s hand was in it with them.\n“I understand you’ve met our Namri,” Halleck said. “Pray believe him, young sir. He has one function and one function only. He’s the one capable of killing you should the need arise.”\nLeto responded automatically with his father’s tones: “So you've joined my enemies, Gurney! | never thought the—”\n“Try none of your devil tricks on me, lad,” Halleck said. “I’m proof against them all. | follow your grandmother’s orders. Your education has been planned to the last detail. It was she who approved my selection of Namri. What comes next, painful as it may seem, is at her command.”\n“And what does she command?”\nHalleck lifted a hand from the folds of his robe, exposed a Fremen injector, primitive but efficient. Its transparent tube was charged with blue fluid.\nLeto squirmed backward on the cot, was stopped by the rock wall. As he moved, Namri entered, stood beside Halleck with hand on crysknife. Together they blocked the only exit.\n“| see you’ve recognized the spice essence,” Halleck said. “You're to take the worm trip, lad. You must go through it. Otherwise, what your father dared and you dare not would hang over you for the rest of your days.”\nLeto shook his head wordlessly. This was the thing he and Ghanima knew could overwhelm them. Gurney was an ignorant fool! How could Jessica. . . Leto felt the father- presence in his memories. It surged into his mind, trying to Strip away his defenses. Leto wanted to shriek outrage, could not move his lips. But this was the wordless thing which his pre-born awareness most feared. This was prescient trance, the reading of immutable future with all of\nits fixity and its terrors. Surely Jessica could not have ordered such an ordeal for her own grandson. But her presence loomed in his mind, filling him with acceptance arguments. Even the Litany Against Fear was pressed upon him with a repetitive droning: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past... .”\nWith an oath already ancient when Chaldea was young, Leto tried to move, tried to leap at the two men standing over him, but his muscles refused to obey. As though he already existed in the trance, Leto saw Halleck’s hand move, the injector approach. The light of a glowglobe sparkled within the blue fluid. The injector touched Leto’s left arm. Pain lanced through him, shot upward to the muscles of his head.\nAbruptly Leto saw a young woman sitting outside a crude hut in dawnlight. She sat right there in front of him roasting coffee beans to a rose brown, adding cardamom and melange. The voice of a rebeck echoed from somewhere behind him. The music echoed and echoed until it entered his head, still echoing. It suffused his body and he felt himself to be large, very large, not a child at all. And his skin was not his own. He knew that sensation! His skin was not his own. Warmth spread through his body. As abruptly as his first vision, he found himself standing in darkness. It was night. Stars like a rain of embers fell in gusts from a brilliant cosmos.\nPart of him knew there was no escaping, but still he tried to fight it until the father-presence intruded. “I will protect you in the trance. The others within will not take you.”\nWind tumbled Leto, rolled him, hissing, pouring dust and sand over him, cutting his arms, his face, abrading his clothes, whipping the loose-torn ends of now useless fabric. But he felt no pain and he saw the cuts heal as rapidly as\nthey appeared. Still he rolled with the wind. And his skin was not his own.\nIt will happen! he thought.\nBut the thought was distant and came as though it were not his own, not really his own; no more than his skin.\nThe vision absorbed him. It evolved into a stereologic memory which separated past and present, future and present, future and past. Each separation mingled into a trinocular focus which he sensed as the multidimensional relief map of his own future existence.\nHe thought: Time is a measure of space, just as a range- finder is a measure of space, but measuring locks us into the place we measure.\nHe sensed the trance deepening. It came as an amplification of internal consciousness which his self- identity soaked up and through which he felt himself changing. It was living Time and he could not arrest an instant of it. Memory fragments, future and past, deluged him. But they existed as montage-in-motion. Their relationships underwent a constant dance. His memory was a lens, an illuminating searchlight which picked out fragments, isolating them, but forever failing to stop the ceaseless motion and modification which surged into his view.\nThat which he and Ghanima had planned came through the searchlight, dominating everything, but now it terrified him. Vision reality ached in him. The uncritical inevitability made his ego cringe.\nAnd his skin was not his own! Past and present tumbled through him, surging across the barriers of his terror. He could not separate them. One moment he felt himself setting forth on the Butlerian Jihad, eager to destroy any machine which simulated human awareness. That had to be the past—over and done with. Yet his senses hurtled through the experience, absorbing the most minute details. He heard a minister-companion speaking from a pulpit: “We\nmust negate the machines-that-think. Humans must set their own guidelines. This is not something machines can do. Reasoning depends upon programming, not on hardware, and we are the ultimate program!”\nHe heard the voice clearly, knew his surroundings—a vast wooden hall with dark windows. Light came from sputtering flames. And his minister-companion said: “Our Jihad Is a ‘dump program.’ We dump the things which destroy us as humans!”\nAnd it was in Leto’s mind that the speaker had been a servant of computers, one who knew them and serviced them. But the scene vanished and Ghanima stood in front of him, saying: “Gurney knows. He told me. They’re Duncan’s words and Duncan was speaking as a mentat. ‘In doing good, avoid notoriety; in doing evil, avoid self-awareness. ’”\nThat had to be future—far future. But he felt the reality. It was as intense as any past from his multitude of lives. And he whispered: “Isn’t that true, father?”\nBut the father-presence within spoke warningly: “Don’t invite disaster! You’re learning stroboscopic awareness now. Without it you could overrun yourself, lose your place-mark in Time.”\nAnd the bas-relief imagery"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_01619f0a65561cc418161a032315ec92856f84961275580f7e6c5555b43c3718_v2"}
