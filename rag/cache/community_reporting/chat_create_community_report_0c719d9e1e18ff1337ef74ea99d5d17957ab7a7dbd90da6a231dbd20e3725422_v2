He holds the rank of Field Marshal within Dur’s military hierarchy and serves as a regional commander, demonstrating his significant authority. Muzzafar encounters the Bashar Miles Teg in Ysai, where he acts as both a host and an escort, facilitating Teg’s meeting with an Honored Matre. During their interactions, Muzzafar reveals a personal connection to his homeland by showing Teg a holostat of a frame bush, suggesting a lingering attachment to his origins despite his current allegiances.  \n\nHowever, Muzzafar’s relationship with the Honored Matre complicates his role. While he appears to be a loyal servant—possibly under her psychological or chemical control—he also exhibits a degree of awareness, warning Teg about the Honored Matre’s formidable power and expectations. This duality implies that Muzzafar may be a reluctant subordinate, caught between his military duties and the Honored Matre’s dominance. His submissive behavior toward her contrasts with his otherwise authoritative position, hinting at coercion or manipulation.  \n\nDescriptions of Muzzafar’s personality vary. Some portray him as sharing the Honored Matre’s cruel tendencies and joyless demeanor, aligning him with her ruthless methods. Yet another account claims he was killed by Teg during a counterattack, though this may refer to a different individual or a later event not fully detailed in the provided descriptions. Resolving these contradictions, the most coherent interpretation is that Muzzafar is a high-ranking Dur officer who becomes entangled with the Honored Matres, serving them out of loyalty, fear, or compulsion. His fate remains ambiguous, but his role as an intermediary between Teg and the Honored Matre underscores his strategic importance in their conflict.  \n\nIn summary, **MUZZAFAR** is a Field Marshal of Dur, a military leader with personal depth, who navigates a precarious position between duty and subjugation to the Honored Matres. His actions reveal a blend of authority, vulnerability, and complicity in the power struggles of the Scattering.\",4\n1809,DUR,\"Dur is a force from the Scattering, commanded by Muzzafar, with unknown motives and affiliations\"\"\",2\n1811,FRAME BUSH,\"A frame bush is a plant that can be directed to grow into a residence.

His leadership underscores his importance in Dur's military structure, where he oversees both broader strategic command and regional operations.
