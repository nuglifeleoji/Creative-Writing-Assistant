黄原去赴我们订下的约会。而那位藏族姑娘仍然活在这个世界上，你为什么不去寻找她呢？你本来早就应该这么做了！人为了爱情和幸福，付出什么样的代价都是值得的！” \n　　金波激动地用胳膊紧紧搂住少平的肩头，说：“如果晓霞还活着，我又找到了我心爱的人，那咱们这辈子活得该多好啊！” \n　　“我现在只能盼望你如愿地找到那姑娘，我们之间总应该有一个人获得完美的爱情……”少平说着，眼里似有泪光闪烁。 \n　　金波沉默了一会，问：“你现在有自己喜欢的人吗？”“说不清楚……”少平不知道自己为什么这样回答这个问题。 \n　　“有件事，我早想对你说了，但一直找不到合适的机会……”金波掏出一支烟，往正在燃烧的那支上接。少平停住脚步，疑惑地看着他。 \n　　“去年夏天你离开黄原后，我就想，也许我妹妹可以和你在一块生活……” \n　　少平震惊地呆住了。 \n　　半天，他才说：“秀不是已经和养民好了吗？”“有这事，她起先写信问过我一些养民的情况。我如实告诉她，顾养民是个很好的人。可是后来，秀一直犹豫着没有答应顾养民。她说尽管养民各方面都好，但她不喜欢他的性格和气质。她说她希望找一个象你一样的人，而不管这个人是干什么的……正是这句话，才使我产生了向你提这件事的想法……” \n　　孙少平感动地看着他的好朋友。他不仅为他的好意感动；也为他们的成长和成熟而感动。是的，他们过去怎能想到，今天他们会进行这样一种谈话呢？ \n　　“如果你……不反对，我可以对秀说这件事。”金波用目光询问他。 \n　　“别这样，”少平说。”我一辈子是个煤矿工人，秀是医学院的大学生，这样会毁了他的。我这样说，并不是出于世俗的考虑，而是从客观现实出发。再说，我知道养民对她爱得很深，秀不是完全不喜欢他；他们的结合才是合理的……”“合理？”金波不解地问。 \n　　少平点点头。 \n　　这样，他们就不再提说这件事了。两个人折转身，又慢慢往灯火闪闪的矿区走去……这一夜，两个人就一块挤在少平的床上。 \n　　他们几乎通夜没合眼，从过去说到现在，从一个话题又转到另一个话题，一直兴奋地说到天明。 \n　　天明以后，金波就搭上去铜城的公共汽车，离开了大牙湾煤矿。两个人在汽车旁约定，如果金波找到了那位藏族姑娘，返回时他们将一块再来这里看望少平……金波坐火车到省城后，连火车站也没离开，就搭上了西行的列车。 \n　　列车在向前飞驰，穿过河西走廊，穿过兰州，穿过无边的山峦，驶向青海。
