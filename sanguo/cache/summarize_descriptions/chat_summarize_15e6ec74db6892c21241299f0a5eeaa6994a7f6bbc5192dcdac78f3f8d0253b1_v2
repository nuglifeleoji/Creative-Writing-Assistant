He is recognized for his strategic acumen and loyalty to the Eastern Wu, having previously fought alongside Sun Ce in campaigns against various adversaries, including Yan Baihu.\n\nOne of Huang Gai's most notable strategies was his proposal for a fire attack against the forces of Cao Cao, which involved the innovative use of fire ships to target enemy vessels.
