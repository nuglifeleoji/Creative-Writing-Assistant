As the supreme leader of the Earth Trisolaris Rebellion, she serves as a spiritual guide, though her direct involvement in the organization's operations is limited. Ye's character is marked by her significant interactions with alien civilizations, stemming from her work at the Red Coast Base (红岸基地), where she contributed to the development of radio astronomy and engaged in research on solar electromagnetic radiation.\n\nBorn in June 1947, Ye Wenjie is a retired professor specializing in astrophysics, with a background in electronic engineering and computer science. Her academic journey was profoundly affected by the Cultural Revolution, during which she faced immense personal hardships, including the traumatic loss of her father, who was a victim of political violence. This legacy of loss shapes her worldview and her reflections on humanity's irrationality and the moral implications of scientific progress.\n\nThroughout her life, Ye has grappled with her past, including her father's death and her own experiences during the Cultural Revolution. She is depicted as a sensitive and introspective individual, often reflecting on her childhood and the societal changes around her. Her character embodies a connection to historical events, particularly the experiences of the Red Guards, and she is portrayed as someone who seeks closure regarding her father's legacy.\n\nYe Wenjie is also involved in significant scientific endeavors, including the observation of cosmic background radiation and the decoding of unusual signals from space. Her work at the Red Coast Base includes operating monitoring systems and engaging in discussions about extraterrestrial communication, which further complicates her character as she navigates the moral and ethical dilemmas associated with such knowledge.\n\nIn addition to her scientific pursuits, Ye is depicted as a mother to Yang Dong, and her relationship with her daughter adds another layer of emotional depth to her character. She is portrayed as a gentle intellectual, reflecting on environmental issues and the impact of deforestation, which resonates with her sensitivity to the suffering of nature.\n\nYe Wenjie is also a figure of redemption, facing trial for her past actions and presented with opportunities to contribute positively to society through defense research projects. Her journey is marked by a transformation from a secluded existence to rejoining society, where she continues to reflect on her past and the implications of her choices.\n\nOverall, Ye Wenjie is a multifaceted character who embodies the struggles of a scientist caught between personal trauma, historical legacy, and the pursuit of knowledge in a world fraught with moral complexities. Her role in the Earth Trisolaris Rebellion and her interactions with extraterrestrial intelligence position her as a key figure in the narrative, representing both the potential and the peril of humanity's quest for understanding beyond its own boundaries.\",158\r\n107,叶文雪,叶文雪是叶文洁的妹妹，以其激进的红卫兵身份而闻名。她在文化大革命期间积极参与运动，尤其是对她父亲的举报，这为她父亲的下台做出了贡献。叶文雪与反动学术权威的家庭关系决裂，显示出她在当时社会动荡中的立场和选择。然而，叶文雪的命运并不幸，她在两年前因武斗而惨死。这一系列事件不仅反映了她个人的激进立场，也揭示了那个时代家庭关系的复杂性和社会动荡带来的悲剧。,2\r\n712,太阳数学模型,太阳数学模型是叶文洁在研究生期间发表的论文，试图建立对太阳的物理描述。,2\r\n3,中国,\"中国 is the country where the events of the narrative take place, specifically during the Cultural Revolution in 1967.\",2\r\n795,调查,,2\r\n817,铜烟袋锅,The act of sharing a 铜烟袋锅 among women symbolizes community bonding and cultural practices in the village.,2\r\n819,油灯,\"油灯 is a source of light that plays a significant role in the quiet evenings shared by 叶文洁 and 大凤, symbolizing warmth and intimacy.\",2\r\n830,三个老红卫兵,三个老红卫兵 are the three former Red Guards who were involved in the events surrounding 叶文洁's father's death and whom she seeks to confront.,2\r\n856,大西洋,\"The Atlantic Ocean, referred to as \"\"大西洋\"\" in Chinese, is a significant body of water currently involved in military operations, particularly where the vessel \"\"审判日号\"\" is operating.
