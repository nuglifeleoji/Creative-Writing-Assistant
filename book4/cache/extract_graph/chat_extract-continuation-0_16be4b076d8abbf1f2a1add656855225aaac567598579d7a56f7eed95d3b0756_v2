\n　　李登云见徐国强进来，慌忙站起来，握住老汉的手，热情地问候道：“你老最近身体还好？” \n　　“还好！还好！”徐国强点着头，“不过，也不行了，腰腿有点毛病，行走不太方便。岁数不饶人啊！” \n　　“好好叫爱云给你看一看！”登云关切地说。 \n　　“医生治不了家里人的病……你喝茶！”徐国强坐在椅子上，指着旁边的那盒点心说：“你来我就高兴了，还常带什么礼物哩！” \n　　“你看你老说的！你老栽培了我大半辈子，我常忙得顾不上来看望你老。你老过生日，我表示自己的一点心意嘛！这蛋糕是我专门吩咐向前从省城里买的，名字就叫个‘生日蛋糕’。听说外国人过生日就兴吃这东西，还在上面点蜡哩……” \n　　因为晓霞和润叶还没回来，因此徐爱云先没上菜，窑里这三个人就坐下喝茶拉话。 \n　　“最近又忙什么哩？”徐国强没话寻话地问李登云。“哈呀……忙得往医院里跑呢！这几天牙关子又肿了，疼得人心神不安！”李登云因为和田福军的关系，不愿谈什么工作，就给老汉说他的牙疼病。 \n　　“人常说，牙疼不算病，疼起来要人的命！”徐国强马上接住话碴。反正他没什么专门的话题，拉什么话都行。 \n　　为了证实徐老说的对，李登云马上“嘘”地倒吸了一口气，用手掌在腮帮子上按了按。 \n　　这时候，听见晓霞和润叶说笑着回来了。爱云喊她们两个帮忙往窑里端菜。 \n　　三个女人忙得进进出出，不一会桌上的酒菜都齐备了。 \n　　于是，田福军一家和李登云坐下来——为庆祝徐国强老汉六十五大寿的宴会就算开始了。 \n　　李登云先端起酒杯站起来，说：“本来我牙疼，不能喝酒。但今天是徐老六十五大寿，我心里高兴，为了徐老的健康长寿，咱们干一杯！” \n　　田福军一家人都站起来，男的白酒，女的红酒，都逐个和徐国强碰了杯，然后一饮而尽。徐国强满面红光，笑吟吟地摸着自己刮剃得光光亮亮的嘴巴。 \n　　“夹菜！”徐爱云说着，就给李登云的盘子里夹了些鸡肉块。这季节，还没什么青菜，桌子上大部分是肉食。 \n　　李登云说他牙疼，嚼不动肉，在他旁边的润叶就给他舀了些豆腐和丸子。 \n　　李登云对润叶说：“你这娃娃怎不到我家里去串门？”“我常忙着哩……”润叶红着脸说。 \n　　徐爱云和李登云交换了\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>李登云<|>PERSON<|>李登云 is a person who is
