with Sheeana. Odrade had never before focused on how easily the Missionaria Protectiva’s teachings destroyed human independence. That was always the goal, of course: Make them followers, obedient to our needs.\nThe Tyrant’s words in that secret chamber had done more than ignite her fears for the Sisterhood’s future.\n“I bequeath to you my fear and loneliness.”\nFrom that millennial distance, he had planted doubts in her as surely as she had planted them in Waff.\nShe saw the Tyrant’s questions as though they had been limned with glowing light on her inner eye.\n“WITH WHOM DO YOU ALLY?”\nAre we no more than a secret society? How will we meet our end? In a dogmatic stink of our own creation?\nThe Tyrant’s words had been burned into her consciousness. Where was the “noble purpose” in what the Sisterhood did? Odrade could almost hear Taraza’s sneering response to such a question.\n“Survival, Dar! That’s all the noble purpose we need. Survival! Even the Tyrant knew that!”\nPerhaps even Tuek had known it. And what had that bought him in the end?\nOdrade felt a haunting sympathy for the late High Priest. Tuek had been a superb example of what a tightly knit family could produce. Even his name was a clue: unchanged from Atreides days on this planet. The founding ancestor had been a smuggler, confidant of the first Leto. Tuek had come from a family that held firmly to its roots, saying: “There is something worth preserving in our past.” The example this set for descendants was not lost ona Reverend Mother.\nBut you failed, Tuek.\nThese blocks of modernization visible out her window were a sign of that failure—sops to the rising power elements in Rakian society, those elements that the Sisterhood had worked so long to foster and strengthen. Tuek had seen this as a harbinger of the day when he would be too weak politically to prevent the things implied by such modernization:\nA shorter and more upbeat ritual.\nNew songs, more in the modern manner.\nChanges in the dancing. (“Traditional dances take so long!”)\nAbove all, fewer ventures into the dangerous desert for the young postulants from the powerful families.\nOdrade sighed and glanced back at Waff. The little Tleilaxu chewed his lower lip. Good!\nDamn you, Albertus! | would welcome your rebellion!\nBehind the closed doors of the Temple, the transition of the High Priesthood already was being debated. The new Rakians spoke of the need “to keep up with the times.” They meant: “Give us more power!”\nIt has always been this way, Odrade thought. Even in the Bene Gesserit.\nStill, she could not escape the thought: Poor Tuek.\nAlbertus reported that Tuek, just before his death and replacement by the Face Dancer, had warned his kin they might not retain familial control of the High Priesthood when he died. Tuek had been more subtle and resourceful than his enemies expected. His family already was calling in its debts, gathering its resources to retain a power base.\nAnd the Face Dancer in Tuek’s place revealed much by his mimic performance. The Tuek family had not yet learned of the substitution and one might almost believe the original High Priest had not been replaced, so good was this Face Dancer. Observing that Face Dancer in action betrayed much to the watchful Reverend Mothers. That, of course, was one of the things that had Waff squirming now.\nOdrade turned abruptly on one heel and strode across to the Tleilaxu Master. Time to have at him!\nShe stopped two paces from Waff and glared down at him. Waff met her gaze with defiance.\n“You've had enough time to consider your position,” she accused. “Why do you remain silent?”\n“My position? You think you give us a choice?”\n“Man is but a pebble dropped in a pool,” she quoted at him from his own beliefs.\nWaff took a trembling breath. She spoke the proper words, but what lay behind such words? They no longer sounded right coming from the mouth of a powindah woman.\nWhen Waff did not respond, Odrade continued her quotation: “And if man is but a pebble, then all his works can be no more.”\nAn involuntary shudder swept through Odrade, causing a look of carefully masked surprise in the watchful guardian Sisters. That shudder was not part of the required performance.\nWhy do I think of the Tyrant’s words at this moment? Odrade wondered.\n“THE BODY AND SOUL OF THE BENE GESSERIT WILL MEET THE SAME FATE AS ALL OTHER BODIES AND ALL OTHER SOULS.”\nHis barb had gone deep into her.\nHow was I made so vulnerable? The answer leaped into her awareness: The Atreides Manifesto!\nComposing those words under Taraza’s watchful guidance opened a flaw within me.\nCould that have been Taraza’s purpose: to make Odrade vulnerable? How could Taraza have known what would be found here on Rakis? The Mother Superior not only displayed no prescient abilities, she tended to avoid this talent in others. On the rare occasions when Taraza had demanded such a performance of Odrade herself, the reluctance had been obvious to the trained eye of a Sister.\nYet she made me vulnerable.\nHad it been an accident?\nOdrade sank into a swift recital of the Litany Against Fear, only a few eyeblinks but in that time Waff visibly came to a decision.\n“You would force it upon us,” he said. “But you do not know what powers we have reserved for such a moment.” He lifted his sleeves to show where the dart throwers had been. “These were but paltry toys by comparison with our real weapons.”\n“The Sisterhood has never doubted this,” Odrade said.\n“Is it to be violent conflict between us?” he asked.\n“It is your choice to make,” she said.\n“Why do you court violence?”\n“There are those who would love to see Bene Gesserit and Bene Tleilax at each other’s throats,” Odrade said. “Our enemies would enjoy stepping in to pick up the pieces after we had weakened ourselves sufficiently.”\n“You state the argument for agreement but you give my people no room to negotiate! Perhaps your Mother Superior gave you no authority to negotiate!”\nHow tempting it was to pass it all back into Taraza’s hands, just as Taraza wanted. Odrade glanced at the guardian Sisters. The two faces were masks betraying nothing. What did they really know? Would they realize if she went against Taraza’s orders?\n“Do you have such authority?” Waff persisted.\nNoble purpose, Odrade thought. Surely, the Tyrant’s Golden Path demonstrated at least one quality of such purpose.\nOdrade decided on a creative truth. “I have such authority,” she said. Her own words made it true. Having taken the authority, she made it impossible for Taraza to deny it. Odrade knew, though, that her own words committed her to a course sharply divergent from the sequential steps of Taraza’s design.\nIndependent action. The very thing she had desired of Albertus.\nBut I am on the scene and know what is needed.\nOdrade glanced at the guardian Sisters. “Remain here, please, and see that we are not disturbed.” To Waff, she said: “We might as well be comfortable.” She indicated two chairdogs set at right angles to each other across the room.\nOdrade waited until they were seated before resuming the conversation. “We require a degree of candor between us that diplomacy seldom allows. Too much hangs in the balance for us to engage in shallow evasions.”\nWaff looked at her strangely. He said: “We know there is dissension in your highest councils. Subtle overtures have been made to us. Is this part of...”\n“|I am loyal to the Sisterhood,” she said. “Even those who approached you had no other loyalty.”\n“Is this another trick of—”\n“No tricks!”\n“With the Bene Gesserit there are always tricks,” he accused.\n“What is it you fear from us? Name it.”\n“Perhaps | have learned too much from you for you to allow me to go on living.”\n“Could | not say the same of you?” she asked. “Who else knows of our secret affinity? This is no powindah female talking to you here!”\nShe had ventured the word with some trepidation, but the effect could not have been more revealing. Waff was visibly Shaken. He was a long minute recovering. Doubts remained, though, because she had planted them in him.\n“What do words prove?” he asked. “You might still take the things you have learned from me and leave my people nothing. You still hold the whip over us.”\n“| carry no weapons in my sleeves,” Odrade said.\n“But in your mind is knowledge that could ruin us!” He glanced back at the guardian Sisters.\n“They are part of my arsenal,” Odrade agreed. “Shall | send them away?”\n“And in their minds everything they have heard here,” he said. He returned his wary gaze to Odrade. “Better if you all sent your memories away!”\nOdrade pitched her voice in its most reasonable tones. “What would we gain by exposing your missionary zeal before you are ready to move? Would it serve us to blacken your reputation by revealing where you have placed your new Face Dancers? Oh, yes, we know about Ix and the Fish Speakers. Once we had studied your new ones, we went searching for them.”\n“You see!” His voice was dangerously edged.\n“I see no other way to prove our affinity than to reveal something equally damaging about ourselves,” Odrade said.\nWaff was speechless.\n“We would plant the worms of the Prophet on uncounted planets of the Scattering,” she said. “What would the Rakian priesthood say and do if you revealed that?”\nThe guardian Sisters looked at her with thinly masked amusement. They thought she was lying.\n“I have no guards with me,” Waff said. “When only one person knows a dangerous thing, how easy it is to gain that person’s eternal silence.”\nShe lifted her empty sleeves.\nHe looked at the guardian Sisters.\n“Very well,” Odrade said. She glanced at the Sisters and gave a subtle handsign to reassure them. “Wait outside, please, Sisters.”\nWhen the door closed behind them, Waff returned to his doubts. “My people have not searched these rooms. What do | know of the things that could be hidden here to record our words?”\nOdrade shifted into the language of the Islamiyat. “Then perhaps we should speak another tongue, one known only to us.”\nWaff’s eyes glittered. In the same tongue, he said: “Very well! | will gamble on it. And I ask you to tell me the real cause of dissension among the. . . the Bene Gesserit.”\nOdrade allowed herself a smile. With the change of language, Waff’s entire personality, his whole manner, changed. He was performing exactly as expected. None of his doubts had been reinforced in this tongue!\nShe responded with an equal confidence: “Fools fear that we may bring back another Kwisatz Haderach! That is what a few of my Sisters argue.”\n“There is no more need of such a one,” Waff said. “The one who could be many places simultaneously has been and he has gone. He came only to bring the Prophet.”\n“God would not send such a message twice,” she said.\nIt was the very sort of thing Waff had heard often in this tongue. He no longer thought it strange", "Waff’s eyes glittered. In the same tongue, he said: “Very well! | will gamble on it.

He no longer thought it strange that a woman could utter such words. The language and the familiar words were enough.\n“Has Schwangyu’s death restored unity among your Sisters?” he asked.\n“We have a common enemy,” Odrade said.\n“The Honored Matres!”\n“You were wise to kill them and learn from them.”\nWaff leaned forward, completely caught up in his familiar tongue and the flow of their conversation. “They rule with sex!” he exulted. “Remarkable techniques of orgasmic amplification! We—” Belatedly, he became aware of who was sitting in front of him hearing all of this.\n“We already know such techniques,” Odrade reassured him. “It will be interesting to compare, but there are obvious reasons why we have never tried to ride to power on such a dangerous conveyance. Those whores are just stupid enough to make that mistake!”\n“Mistake?” He was clearly puzzled.\n“They are holding the reins in their own hands!” she said. “As the power grows, their control of it must grow. The thing will shatter of its own momentum!”\n“Power, always power,” Waff muttered. Another thought struck him. “Are you saying this was how the Prophet fell?”\n“He knew what he was doing,” she said. “Millennia of enforced peace followed by the Famine Times and the Scattering. A message of direct results. Remember! He did not destroy the Bene Tleilax or the Bene Gesserit.”\n“For what do you hope from an alliance between our two peoples?” Waff asked.\n“Hope is one thing, survival another,” she said.\n“Always pragmatism,” Waff said. “And some among you fear that you may restore the Prophet on Rakis with all of his powers intact?”\n“Did I not say it?” The language of the Islamiyat was particularly potent in this questioning form. It placed the burden of proof on Waff.\n“So they doubt God’s hand in the creation of your Kwisatz Haderach,” he said. “Do they also doubt the Prophet?”\n“Very well, let us have it all out in the open,” Odrade said, and launched herself on the chosen course of deception: “Schwangyu and those who supported her broke away from\nthe Great Belief. We harbor no anger toward any Bene Tleilax for having killed them. They saved us the trouble.”\nWaff accepted this utterly. Given the circumstances, it was precisely what could be expected. He knew he had revealed much here that might better have been held in reserve but there were still things the Bene Gesserit did not know. And the things he had learned!\nOdrade shocked him totally then by saying: “Waff, if you think your descendants from the Scattering have returned to you unchanged, then foolishness has become your way of life.”\nHe held himself silent.\n“You have all of the pieces in your hands,” she said. “Your descendants belong to the whores of the Scattering. And if you think any of them will abide by an agreement, then your stupidity goes beyond description!”\nWaff’s reactions told her she had him. The pieces were clicking into place. She had told him truth where it was required. His doubts were refocused where they belonged: against the people of the Scattering. And it had been done in his own tongue.\nHe tried to speak past a constriction in his throat and was forced to massage his throat before speech returned. “What can we do?”\n“It’s obvious. The Lost Ones have their eyes on us as just one more conquest. They think of it as cleaning up behind them. Common prudence.”\n“But they are so many!”\n“Unless we unite in a common plan to defeat them, they will chew us up the way a slig chews up its dinner.”\n“We cannot submit to powindah filth! God will not permit it!”\n“Submit? Who suggests that we submit?”\n“But the Bene Gesserit always use that ancient excuse: ‘If you can’t beat them, join them.’”\nOdrade smiled grimly. “God will not permit you to submit! Do you suggest He would permit it of us?”\n“Then what is your plan? What would you do against such numbers?”\n“Exactly what you plan to do: convert them. When you say the word, the Sisterhood will openly espouse the true faith.”\nWaff sat in stunned silence. So she knew the heart of the Tleilaxu plan. Did she know also how the Tleilaxu would enforce it?\nOdrade stared at him, openly speculative. Grasp the beast by the balls if you must, she thought. But what if the projection by the Sisterhood’s analysts was wrong? This whole negotiation would be a joke in that case. And there was that look in the back of Waff’s eyes, that suggestion of older wisdom... much older than his flesh. She spoke with more confidence than she felt:\n“What you have achieved with gholas from your tanks and kept secretly for yourselves alone, others will pay a great price to achieve.”\nHer words were sufficiently cryptic (Were others listening?) but Waff did not doubt for an instant that the Bene Gesserit knew even this thing.\n“Will you demand a share in that as well?” he asked. The words rasped in his dry throat.\n“Everything! We will share everything.”\n“What will you bring to this great sharing?”\n“Ask.”\n“All of your breeding records.”\n“They are yours.”\n“Breeding mothers of our choice.”\n“Name them.”\nWaff gasped. This was far more than the Mother Superior had offered. It was like a blossom opening in his awareness. She was right about the Honored Matres, naturally—and\nabout the Tleilaxu descendants from the Scattering. He had never completely trusted them. Never!\n“You will want an unrestricted source of melange, of course,” he said.\n“Of course.”\nHe stared at her, hardly believing the extent of his good fortune. The axlotl tanks would offer immortality only to those who espoused the Great Belief. No one would dare attack and attempt to seize a thing they knew the Tleilaxu would destroy rather than lose. And now! He had gained the services of the most powerful and enduring missionary force known. Surely, the hand of God was visible here. Waff was first awed and then inspired. He spoke softly to Odrade.\n“And you, Reverend Mother, how do you name our accord?”\n“Noble purpose,” she said. “You already know the Prophet’s words from Sietch Tabr. Do you doubt him?”\n“Never! But... but there is one thing: What do you propose with that ghola of Duncan Idaho and the girl, Sheeana?”\n“We will breed them, of course. And their descendants will speak for us to all of those descendants of the Prophet.”\n“On all of those planets where you would take them!”\n“On all of those planets,” she agreed.\nWaff sat back. / have you, Reverend Mother! he thought. We will rule this alliance, not you. The ghola is not yours; he is ours!\nOdrade saw the shadow of his reservations in Waff’s eyes but knew she had ventured as much as she dared. More would reawaken doubts. Whatever happened, she had committed the Sisterhood to this course. Taraza could not escape this alliance now.\nWaff squared his shoulders, a curiously juvenile gesture belied by the ancient intelligence peering from his eyes. “Ahhhh, one thing more,” he said, every bit the Master of Masters speaking his own language and commanding all of\nthose who heard him. “Will you also help spread this... this Atreides Manifesto?”\n“Why not? | wrote it.”\nWaff jerked forward. “You?”\n“Did you think someone of lesser abilities could have done it?”\nHe nodded, convinced without further argument. This was fuel for a thought that had entered his own mind, a final point in their alliance: The powerful minds of Reverend Mothers would advise the Tleilaxu at every turn! What did it matter that they were outnumbered by those whores of the Scattering? Who could match such combined wisdom and insurmountable weapons?\n“The title of the Manifesto is valid, too,” Odrade said. “| am a true descendant of the Atreides.”\n“Would you be one of our breeders?” he ventured.\n“lam almost past the age of breeding, but | am yours to command.”\n| remember friends from wars all but we forgot.\nAll of them distilled into each wound we caught. Those wounds are all the painful places where we fought. Battles better left behind, ones we never sought. What is it that we spent and what was it we bought?\n—SONGS OF THE SCATTERING\nurzmali based his planning on the best of what he had\nlearned from his Bashar, keeping his own counsel about multiple options and fallback positions. That was a commander’s prerogative! Necessarily, he learned everything he could about the terrain.\nIn the time of the Old Empire and even under the reign of Muad’Dib, the region around the Gammu Keep had been a forest reserve, high ground rising well above the oily residue that tended to cover Harkonnen land. On this ground, the Harkonnens had grown some of the finest pilingitam, a wood of steady currency, always valued by the supremely rich. From the most ancient times, the knowledgeable had preferred to surround themselves with fine woods rather than with the mass-produced artificial materials known then as polastine, polaz, and pormabat (latterly: tine, laz, and bat). As far back as the Old Empire there had been a pejorative label for the small rich and Families Minor arising from the knowledge of a rare wood’s value.\n“He’s a three P-O,” they said, meaning that such a person surrounded himself with cheap copies made from déclassé substances. Even when the supremely rich were forced to employ one of the distressful three P-Os, they disguised it where possible behind O-P (the Only P), pilingitam.\nBurzmali knew all of this and more as he set his people to searching for a strategically situated pilingitam near the no- globe. The wood of the tree had many qualities that endeared it to master artisans: Newly cut, it worked like a softwood; dried and aged, it endured as a hardwood. It absorbed many pigments and the finish could be made to appear as though it occurred naturally within the grain. More important, pilingitam was anti-fungal and no known insect had ever considered it a suitable dinner. Lastly, it was fire-resistant, and aged specimens of the living tree grew outward from an enlarged and empty tube at the core.\n“We will do the unexpected,” Burzmali told his searchers.\nHe had noted the distinctive", " from déclassé substances. Even when the supremely rich were forced to employ one of the distressful three P-Os, they disguised it where possible behind O-P (the Only P), pilingitam.\nBurzmali knew all of this and more as he set his people to searching for a strategically situated pilingitam near the no- globe. The wood of the tree had many qualities that endeared it to master artisans: Newly cut, it worked like a softwood; dried and aged, it endured as a hardwood. It absorbed many pigments and the finish could be made to appear as though it occurred naturally within the grain. More important, pilingitam was anti-fungal and no known insect had ever considered it a suitable dinner. Lastly, it was fire-resistant, and aged specimens of the living tree grew outward from an enlarged and empty tube at the core.\n“We will do the unexpected,” Burzmali told his searchers.\nHe had noted the distinctive lime green of pilingitam leaves during his first overflight of the region. The forests of this planet had been raided and otherwise logged off during the Famine Times but venerable O-Ps were still nurtured among the evergreens and hardwoods replanted at the Sisterhood’s orders.\nBurzmali’s searchers found one such O-P dominating a ridge above the no-globe site. It spread its leaves over almost three hectares. On the afternoon of the critical day, Burzmali placed decoys at a distance from this position and opened a tunnel from a shallow swale into the pilingitam’s roomy core. There, he set up his command post and the backup necessities for escape.\n“The tree is a life form,” he explained to his people. “It will mask us from tracers.”\nThe unexpected.\nNowhere in his planning did Burzmali assume that all of his actions would go undetected. He could only spread his vulnerability.\nWhen the attack came, he saw that it appeared to follow a predicted pattern. He had anticipated that attackers would rely on no-ships and great numbers as they had in the assault on the Gammu Keep. The Sisterhood’s analysts assured him that the major threat was from forces out of the\nScattering—descendants of the Tleilaxu deployed by wildly brutal women calling themselves Honored Matres. He saw this as overconfidence and not audacity. A real audacity was in the arsenal of every student taught by the Bashar Miles Teg. It also helped that Teg could be relied upon to improvise within the limits of a plan.\nThrough his relays, Burzmali followed the scrambling escape of Duncan and Lucilla. Troopers with com-helmets and night lenses created a great display of activity at the decoy positions while Burzmali and his select reserves kept watch on the attackers, never betraying their position. Teg’s movements were easily followed by his violent response to the attackers.\nBurzmali noted with approval that Lucilla did not pause when she heard the battle sounds intensify. Duncan, however, tried to stop and almost ruined the plan. Lucilla saved the moment by jabbing Duncan in a sensitive nerve and barking: “You can’t help him!”\nHearing her voice clearly through his helmet amplifiers, Burzmali cursed under his breath. Others would hear her, too! No doubt they already were tracking her, though.\nBurzmali issued a subvocal command through the microphone implanted in his neck and prepared to abandon his post. He kept most of his attention on the approach of Lucilla and Duncan. If all went as planned, his people would bring down the pair of them while two helmetless and Suitably garbed troopers continued the flight toward the decoy positions.\nIn the interim, Teg was creating an admirable path of destruction through which a groundcar might escape.\nAn aide intruded on Burzmali: “Two attackers are closing in behind the Bashar!”\nBurzmali waved the man aside. He could give little thought to Teg’s chances. Everything had to be focused on saving the ghola. Burzmali’s thoughts were intense as he watched:\nCome on! Run! Run, damn you!\nLucilla held a similar thought as she urged Duncan forward, keeping herself close behind him to shield him from the rear. Everything about her was marshaled for ultimate resistance. Everything in her breeding and training came to the fore in these moments. Never give up! To give up was to pass her consciousness into the Memory Lives of a Sister or into oblivion. Even Schwangyu had redeemed herself in the end by reverting to total resistance and had died admirably in the Bene Gesserit tradition, resisting to the last. Burzmali had reported it through Teg. Lucilla, assembling her uncounted lives, thought: / can do no less!\nShe followed Duncan down into a shallow swale beside the bole of a giant pilingitam and, when people arose out of the darkness to drag them down, she almost responded in berserker mode but a voice speaking Chakobsa in her ear said: “Friends!” This delayed her response for a heartbeat while she saw the decoys continue the flight out of the swale. That more than anything else revealed the plan and the identity of the people holding them against the rich leafy smells of the earth. When the people slid Duncan ahead of her into a tunnel aimed at the giant tree and (still in Chakobsa) cautioned speed, Lucilla knew she was caught in a typical Teg-style audacity.\nDuncan saw it, too. At the stygian outlet of the tunnel, he identified her by smell and tapped out a message against her arm in the old Atreides silent battle language.\n“Let them lead.”\nThe form of the message startled her momentarily until she realized that the ghola of course would know this communication method.\nWithout speaking, the people around them removed Duncan’s bulky antique lasgun and hustled the fugitives into the hatch of a vehicle that she did not identify. A brief red light flared in the darkness.\nBurzmali spoke subvocally to his people: “There they go!”\nTwenty-eight groundcars and eleven flitter-thopters scrambled from the decoy positions. A proper diversion, Burzmali thought.\nPressure in Lucilla’s ears told her a hatch had been sealed. Again the red light flared and went dark.\nExplosives shattered the great tree around them and their vehicle, now identifiable as an armored groundcar, surged up and out on suspensors and jets. Lucilla could follow their course only by flashes of fire and the twisting patterns of stars visible through frames of oval plaz. The enclosing suspensor field made the motions eerie, sensed only by the eyes. They sat cradled in plasteel seats while their car rocketed downslope directly across Teg’s holdout position, shifting and darting in violent changes of direction. None of this wild motion transmitted itself to the flesh of the occupants. There were only the dancing blurs of trees and brush, some of them burning, and then the stars.\nThey were hugging the tops of the forest wreckage left by Teg’s lasguns! Only then did she dare to hope that they might win free. Abruptly, their vehicle trembled into slow flight. The visible stars, framed by the tiny ovals of plaz, tipped and were obscured by a dark obstruction. Gravity returned and there was dim light. Lucilla saw Burzmali fling open a hatch on her left.\n“Out!” he snapped. “Not a second to spare!”\nDuncan ahead of her, Lucilla scrambled out of the hatch onto damp earth. Burzmali thumped her back, grabbed Duncan’s arm and hustled them away from the car. “Quick! This way!” They crashed through tall bushes onto a narrow paved roadway. Burzmali, a hand on each of them now, rushed them across the road and pushed them flat in a ditch. He whipped a life-shield blanket over them and lifted his head to look back in the direction from which they had come.\nLucilla peered past him and saw starlight on a snowy Slope. She felt Duncan stir beside her.\nFar up the slope, a speeding groundcar, its jet-pod modifications visible against the stars, lifted on a plume of red, climbing, climbing . . . climbing. Suddenly, it darted off to the right.\n“Ours?” Duncan whispered.\n“Yes.”\n“How did it get up there without showing a...”\n“An abandoned aqueduct tunnel,” Burzmali whispered. “The car was programed to go on automatic.” He continued to stare at the distant red plume. Abruptly, a gigantic burst of blue light rolled outward from the faraway red tracery. The light was followed immediately by a dull thump.\n“Ahhhhh,” Burzmali breathed.\nDuncan, his voice low, said: “They are supposed to think you overloaded your drive.”\nBurzmali shot a startled look at the young face, ghostly gray in starlight.\n“Duncan Idaho was one of the finest pilots in Atreides service,” Lucilla said. It was an esoteric bit of knowledge and it served its purpose. Burzmali saw immediately that he was not just guardian of two fugitives. His charges possessed abilities that could be used if needed.\nBlue and red sparks flashed across the sky where the modified groundcar had exploded. The no-ships were sniffing that distant globe of hot gases. What would the sniffers decide? The blue and red sparks slipped down behind the starlit bulges of the hills.\nBurzmali whirled at the sound of footsteps on the roadway. Duncan had a handgun out so swiftly that Lucilla gasped. She put a restraining hand on his arm but he shook it off. Didn’t he see that Burzmali had accepted this intrusion?\nA voice called softly from the roadway above them: “Follow me. Hurry.”\nThe speaker, a moving blot of darkness, jumped down beside them and went crashing through a gap in the bushes\nlining the road. Dark spots on the snowy slope beyond the screening bushes resolved themselves into at least a dozen armed figures. Five of this party grouped themselves around Duncan and Lucilla and urged them silently along a snow- covered trail beside the bushes. The rest of the armed party ran openly down across the snowslope into a dark line of trees.\nWithin a hundred paces, the five silent figures formed their party into single file, two of their number ahead, three behind, the fugitives sheltered between them with Burzmali leading and Lucilla close behind Duncan. They came presently to a cleft in dark rocks and under a ledge where they waited, listening to more modified groundcars thunder into the air behind them.\n“Decoys upon decoys,” Burzmali whispered. “We overload them with decoys. They know we must flee in panic as fast as possible. Now, we will wait nearby in concealment. Later, we will proceed slowly... on foot.”\n“The unexpected,” Lucilla whispered.\n“Teg?” It was Duncan, his voice little more than a breath.\nBurzmali leaned close to Duncan’s left ear: “I think they got him.” Burzmali’s whisper carried a deep tone of sadness.\nOne of their dark companions said: “Quickly now. Down here.”\nThey were herded through the narrow cleft. Something emitted a creaking sound nearby. Hands hustled them into an enclosed passage. The creaking sounded from behind them.\n“Get that door fixed,” someone said.\nLight flared around them.\nDuncan and Lucilla stared around at a large, richly furnished room apparently cut into rock. Soft carpets covered the floor—dark reds and golds with a figured pattern like repetitive battlements worked in pale green. A bundle of clothing lay in a jumble on a table near Burzmali,\nwho was in low-voiced conversation with one of their escort: a fair-haired man with high forehead and piercing green eyes.\nLuc"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_da67392cc89b2f53cbbfe5fa5e9e3186c718be3bb14a913afd98faec618e2d22_v2"}
