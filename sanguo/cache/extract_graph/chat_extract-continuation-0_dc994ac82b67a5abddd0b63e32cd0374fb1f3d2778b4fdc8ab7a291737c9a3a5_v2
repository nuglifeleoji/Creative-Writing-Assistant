上又添军马。操又大喜，就于帐中设宴作贺。诸将皆暗笑。操曰：“诸公笑我无破马超之谋，公等有何良策？”徐晃进曰：“今丞相盛兵在此，贼亦全部现屯关上，此去河西，必无准备；若得一军暗渡蒲阪津，先截贼归路，丞相径发河北击之，贼两不相应，势必危矣。”操曰：“公明之言，正合吾意。”便教徐晃引精兵四千，和朱灵同去径袭河西，伏于山谷之中，“待我渡河北同时击之。”、徐晃、朱灵领命、先引四千军暗暗去了。操下令，先教曹洪于蒲阪津，安排船筏。留曹仁守寨，操自领兵渡渭河。早有细作报知马超。超曰：“今操不攻潼关，而使人准备船筏，欲渡河北，必将遏吾之后也。吾当引一军循河拒住岸北。操兵不得渡，不消二十日，河东粮尽，操兵必乱，却循河南而击之，操可擒矣。”韩遂曰：“不必如此。岂不闻兵法有云：‘兵半渡可击，’待操兵渡至一半，汝却于南岸击之，操兵皆死于河内矣。超曰：“叔父之言甚善。”即使人探听曹操几时渡河。却说曹操整兵已毕，分三停军，前渡渭河，比及人马到河口时，日光初起。操先发精兵渡过北岸，开创营寨。操自引亲随护卫军将百人，按剑坐于南岸，看军渡河。忽然人报：“后边白袍将军到了！”众皆认得是马超。一拥下船。河边军争上船者，声喧不止。操犹坐而不动，按剑指约休闹。只听得人喊马嘶，蜂拥而来，船上一将跃身上岸，呼曰：“贼至矣！请丞相下船！”操视之，乃许褚也。操口内犹言：“贼至何妨？”回头视之，马超已离不得百余步，许褚拖操下船时，船已离岸一丈有余，褚负操一跃上船。随行将士尽皆下水，扳住船边，争欲上船逃命。船小将翻，褚掣刀乱砍，傍船手尽折，倒于水中。急将船望下水棹去。许褚立于梢上。忙用木篙撑之。操伏在许褚脚边。马超赶到河岸，见船已流在半河，遂拈弓搭箭，喝令骁将绕河射之。矢如雨急。褚恐伤曹操，以左手举马鞍遮之。马超箭不虚发，船上驾舟之人，应弦落水；船中数十人皆被射倒。其船反撑不定，于急水中旋转。许褚独奋神威，将两腿夹舵摇撼，一手使篙撑船，一手举鞍遮护曹操。时有渭\n######################\nOutput:",
