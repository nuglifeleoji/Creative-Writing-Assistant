\n　　他半闭着眼睛，蜷曲在这个早年间就废弃的破碾盘上，一动也不动。如果不是那干瘪的胸脯还在起伏，我们会以为他不再是个活人。 \n　　夏日的阳光热烘烘地照耀着大地。在这样的日子里，人们都巴不得躲到阴凉地方去，而田福堂却专意在这里晒太阳。只有这毒辣辣的阳光和热烫烫的石碾盘，才能使他冰凉干瘦的身体得到某种抚慰。他感谢夏天的阳光给他带来了温暖。 \n　　他没福气在这破碾盘上长时间安静地闭目养神。过个一时半刻，猛烈的咳嗽就象风暴一般把他掀起来，使他不得不可怜地趴在碾盘边上，在呕吐似的“哇哇”声中，把粘痰、鼻涕连同泪水一齐甩在旁边的土地上，这种折磨是可怕的，每一次都象要把五脏六腑从胸膛里掏出来。 \n　　咳嗽完毕，他象白痴那样发半天呆，才又躺倒在碾盘上，享受一会难得的安宁时光。 \n　　我们没有料到，当年双水村或者说整个石圪节一带的风云人物，如今已成了这副样子。在这样的时候，我们不能不对他寄于深切的同情。我们猜想，这位曾经立志要成为永贵式人物的农民政治家，此刻内心中也大概为自己而悲哀。他不知是否明白，他日趋衰败的不仅仅是自己的身体？福堂，你此刻蜷曲在这里，象被抛弃了的孤儿。是的，大伙能看得出来，你早已对双水村的公务不再那么热心。但从根本上说，是双水村的公众事务不再热心于你的指导了，你现在只能孤独地躺卧在这里，反刍你往日吞咽下去的东西。 \n　　的确，对田福堂来说，现在没有什么地方比这个破碾盘更使他感到亲切。躺在这里，他起码能获得片刻的安宁。寻找安宁就象当年寻找轰轰烈烈的政治运动，成了他今天的愿望。 \n　　他身下的这个破碾盘，象一张天然床铺，滚石年经月久在上面碾出的凹槽，刚好使他的瘦身板蜷曲于其间。躺在这个石头凹槽里，就象躺在摇篮一般舒适和妥贴。 \n　　看得出来，他身下这破碾盘曾是一块上好的石头琢打而成。石色湛蓝如水，不含任何一点杂质。从那一圈碾出的深槽判断，这碾盘已很有一些历史了。大概是滚石直把一边碾断一块之后，这碾盘才寿终正寝，结束了它的使命，被搬迁在院墙之外。想不到它现在又被主人派上了新的用场。 \n　　福堂自己也说不清这碾盘的历史，在他记事\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
