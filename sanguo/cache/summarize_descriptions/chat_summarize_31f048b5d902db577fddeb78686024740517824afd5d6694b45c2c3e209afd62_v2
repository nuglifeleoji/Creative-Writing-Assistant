This platform is most notably recognized for its role in the historic event where the Han Emperor (汉帝) formally abdicated his throne to Cao Pi (曹丕). The ceremony that took place on the 受禅坛 marked a pivotal moment in the transition of power, symbolizing the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Cao Wei state during the Three Kingdoms period.
