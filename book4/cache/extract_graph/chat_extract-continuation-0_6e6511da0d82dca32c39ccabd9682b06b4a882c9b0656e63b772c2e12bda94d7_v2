\n　　他现在心里多么苦闷！尽管严格地说来，也许这不能称之谓失恋。但感情上的这种慰藉一旦再不存在，就会给人的心中带来多少烦恼。这是青春的烦恼。我们不妨想一想伟人歌德和他少年时代的化身维特。在这一方面，贵族和平民大概都是一样的。 \n　　那时间，孙少平重新陷入到灰心和失望之中。如果他原来没有和红梅有这种“关系”，他也许只有肠胃的危机。现在，他精神上也出现了危机——这比吃不饱饭更可怕！他每次去拿自己那两个黑干粮的时候，再也看不见她可爱的身影了。那双忧郁而好看的眼睛，现在即是面对面走过来，也不再那样叫人心儿悸动地看他一眼了。在那以后的几个月里，他只是一天天地熬着日子，等待放假……直到上学期临放假的前一个星期，孙少平才想起，几月前郝红梅借过他的一本《创业史》，还没给他还哩。这本书是他借县文化馆的，现在马上就要放假，如果她不还回来，他就没办法给文化馆还了。可他又不愿找她去要书。他心里对她产生了一种说不出的恼火。她现在可以不理他，但她连借走他的书也不还他了吗？ \n　　最后一个星期六，郝红梅还是没给他还书。他也仍然鼓不起勇气问她要。他只好回家去了。他借了金波的自行车，把自己那点破烂铺盖先送回去——下一个星期二就放假，他可以在金波的被窝里一块混几夜，省得放假时背铺盖。 \n　　回家后，他在星期天上午给家里砍了一捆柴，结果把那双本来就破烂的黄胶鞋彻底“报销”了，他只好穿了他哥少安的一双同样破烂的鞋。至于那双扔在家里的没有后跟的袜子，父亲说，等秋天分到一点羊毛，再把后跟补上；袜腰是新的，还不能丢，凑合着穿个两三冬还是可以的——要知道，一双新袜子得两块多钱啊！ \n　　星期天下午，他从家里带着六个高粱面和土豆丝混合蒸的干粮——没有挂包，只用一块破旧的笼布包着，夹在自行车后面，赶暮黑时分回到了学校。 \n　　学校正处于放假前的混乱中，人来人往，搬搬运运，闹闹哄哄，一切都没有了章法。 \n　　他在校门口碰见了金波。金波说他正要出去给家里买点东西，就接过他手中的自行车到街上去了。 \n　　他提着破旧笼布包着的那六个黑干粮，向自己的宿舍走去。 \n　　他突然发现郝红梅在前面走。她大概没有看见他在后面。他真想喊一声她，问问那本书的事。 \n　　他这\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character experiencing
