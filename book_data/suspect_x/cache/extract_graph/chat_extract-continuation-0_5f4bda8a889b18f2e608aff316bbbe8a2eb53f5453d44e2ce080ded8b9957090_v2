She squirmed in her stillsuit. It felt raspingly unfamiliar after all the suitless months of city life. She studied the ghola, wondering if he might know something important about this peculiar death. A lock of his black-goat hair, she saw, had escaped his stillsuit hood. She sensed her hand longing to tuck that hair back into place.\nAs though lured by this thought, his gleaming gray metal eyes turned toward her. The eyes set her trembling and she tore her gaze away from him.\nA Fremen woman had died here from a poison called “the throat of hell.”\nA Fremen addicted to semuta.\nShe shared Paul’s disquiet at this conjunction.\nThe mortuary attendants waited patiently. This corpse contained not enough water for them to salvage. They felt no need to hurry. And they’d believe that Alia, through some glyptic art, was reading a strange truth in these remains.\nNo strange truth came to her.\nThere was only a distant feeling of anger deep within her at the obvious thoughts in the attendants’ minds. It was a product of the damned religious mystery. She and her brother could not be people. They had to be something more. The Bene Gesserit had seen to that by manipulating Atreides ancestry. Their mother had contributed to it by thrusting them onto the path of witchery.\nAnd Paul perpetuated the difference.\nThe Reverend Mothers encapsulated in Alia’s memories stirred restlessly, provoking adab flashes of thought: “Peace,\nLittle One! You are what you are. There are compensations.”\nCompensations!\nShe summoned the ghola with a gesture.\nHe stopped beside her, attentive, patient.\n“What do you see in this?” she asked.\n“We may never learn who it was died here,” he said. “The head, the teeth are gone. The hands... . Unlikely such a one had a genetic record somewhere to which her cells could be matched.”\n“Tleilaxu poison,” she said. “What do you make of that?”\n“Many people buy such poisons.”\n“True enough. And this flesh is too far gone to be regrown as was done with your body.”\n“Even if you could trust the Tleilaxu to do it,” he said.\nShe nodded, stood. “You will fly me back to the city now.”\nWhen they were airborne and pointed north, she said: “You fly exactly as Duncan Idaho did.”\nHe cast a speculative glance at her. “Others have told me this.”\n“What are you thinking now?” she asked.\n“Many things.”\n“Stop dodging my question, damn you!”\n“Which question?”\nShe glared at him.\nHe saw the glare, shrugged.\nHow like Duncan Idaho, that gesture, she thought. Accusingly, her voice thick and with a catch in it, she said: “l merely wanted your reactions voiced to play my own thoughts against them. That young woman’s death bothers me.”\n“I was not thinking about that.”\n“What were you thinking about?”\n“About the strange emotions | feel when people speak of the one | may have been.”\n“May have been?”\n“The Tleilaxu are very clever.”\n“Not that clever. You were Duncan Idaho.”\n“Very likely. It’s the prime computation.”\n“So you get emotional?”\n“To a degree. | feel eagerness. I’m uneasy. There’s a tendency to tremble and | must devote effort to controlling it. | get... flashes of imagery.”\n“What imagery?”\n“It’s too rapid to recognize. Flashes. Spasms... almost memories.”\n“Aren't you curious about such memories?”\n“Of course. Curiosity urges me forward, but | move against a heavy reluctance. | think: ‘What if I’m not the one they believe me to be?’ | don’t like that thought.”\n“And this is all you were thinking?”\n“You know better than that, Alia.”\nHow dare he use my given name? She felt anger rise and go down beneath the memory of the way he’d spoken: softly throbbing undertones, casual male confidence. A muscle twitched along her jaw. She clenched her teeth.\n“Isn't that El Kuds down there?” he asked, dipping a wing briefly, causing a sudden flurry in their escort.\nShe looked down at their shadows rippling across the promontory above Harg Pass, at the cliff and the rock pyramid containing the skull of her father. EI Kuds—the Holy Place.\n“That’s the Holy Place,” she said.\n“I must visit that place one day,” he said. “Nearness to your father’s remains may bring memories | can capture.”\nShe saw suddenly how strong must be this need to know who he’d been. It was a central compulsion with him. She looked back at the rocks, the cliff with its base sloping into a dry beach and a sea of sand—cinnamon rock lifting from the dunes like a ship breasting waves.\n“Circle back,” she said.\n“The escort...”\n“They'll follow. Swing under them.”\nHe obeyed.\n“Do you truly serve my brother?” she asked, when he was on the new course, the escort following.\n“I serve the Atreides,” he said, his tone formal.\nAnd she saw his right hand lift, fall—almost the old salute of Caladan. A pensive look came over his face. She watched him peer down at the rock pyramid.\n“What bothers you?” she asked.\nHis lips moved. A voice emerged, brittle, tight: “He was...hewas...” Atear slid down his cheek.\nAlia found herself stilled by Fremen awe. He gave water to the dead! Compulsively, she touched a finger to his cheek, felt the tear.\n“Duncan,” she whispered.\nHe appeared locked to the 'thopter’s controls, gaze fastened to the tomb below.\nShe raised her voice: “Duncan!”\nHe swallowed, shook his head, looked at her, the metal\neyes glistening. “I... felt... an arm... on my shoulders,” he whispered. “I felt it! An arm.” His throat worked. “It was...a friend. It was... my friend.”\n“Who?”\n“I don’t know. | think it was. .. | don’t know.”\nThe call light began flashing in front of Alia, their escort captain wanting to know why they returned to the desert. She took the microphone, explained that they had paid a brief homage to her father’s tomb. The captain reminded her that it was late.\n“We will go to Arrakeen now,” she said, replacing the microphone.\nHayt took a deep breath, banked their 'thopter around to the north.\n“It was my father’s arm you felt, wasn’t it?” she asked.\n“Perhaps.”\nHis voice was that of the mentat computing probabilities, and she saw he had regained his composure.\n“Are you aware of how | know my father?” she asked.\n“I have some idea.”\n“Let me make it clear,” she said. Briefly, she explained how she had awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before birth, a terrified fetus with the knowledge of countless lives embedded in her nerve cells—and all this after the death of her father.\n“I know my father as my mother knew him,” she said. “In every last detail of every experience she shared with him. In a way, | am my mother. | have all her memories up to the moment when she drank the Water of Life and entered the trance of transmigration.”\n“Your brother explained something of this.”\n“He did? Why?”\n“Į asked.”\n“Why?”\n“A mentat requires data.”\n“Oh.” She looked down at the flat expanse of the Shield Wall—tortured rock, pits and crevices.\nHe saw the direction of her gaze, said: “A very exposed place, that down there.”\n“But an easy place to hide,” she said. She looked at him. “It reminds me of ahuman mind... with all its concealments.”\n“Ahhh,” he said.\n“Ahhh? What does that mean—ahhh?” She was suddenly angry with him and the reason for it escaped her.\n“You'd like to Know what my mind conceals,” he said. It was a Statement, not a question.\n“How do you know | haven’t exposed you for what you are by my powers of prescience?” she demanded.\n“Have you?” He seemed genuinely curious.\n“No!”\n“Sibyls have limits,” he said.\nHe appeared to be amused and this reduced Alia’s anger. “Amused? Have you no respect for my powers?” she asked.\nThe question sounded weakly argumentative even to her own ears.\n“I respect your omens and portents perhaps more than you think,” he said. “I was in the audience for your Morning Ritual.”\n“And what does that signify?”\n“You’ve great ability with symbols,” he said, keeping his attention on the '’thopter’s controls. “That’s a Bene Gesserit thing, I'd say. But, as with many witches, you’ve become careless of your powers.”\nShe felt a spasm of fear, blared: “How dare you?”\n“|I dare much more than my makers anticipated,” he said. “Because of that rare fact, | remain with your brother.”\nAlia studied the steel balls which were his eyes: no human expression there. The stillsuit hood concealed the line of his jaw. His mouth remained firm, though. Great strength in it... and determination. His words had carried a reassuring intensity. “...dare much more...” That was a thing Duncan Idaho might have said. Had the Tleilaxu fashioned their ghola better than they knew—or was this mere sham, part of his conditioning?\n“Explain yourself, ghola,” she commanded.\n“Know thyself, is that thy commandment?” he asked. Again, she felt that he was amused. “Don’t bandy words with me, you... you thing!” she said. She put a hand to the crysknife in its throat sheath. “Why were you given to my\nbrother?”\n“Your brother tells me that you watched the presentation,” he said. “You’ve heard me answer that question for him.”\n“Answer it again... for me!”\n“I am intended to destroy him.”\n“Is that the mentat speaking?”\n“You know the answer to that without asking,” he chided. “And you know, as well, that such a gift wasn’t necessary.\nYour brother already was destroying himself quite adequately.”\nShe weighed these words, her hand remaining on the haft of her knife. A tricky answer, but there was sincerity in the voice.\n“Then why such a gift?” she probed.\n“It may have amused the Tleilaxu. And, it is true, that the Guild asked for me as a gift.”\n“Why?”\n“Same answer.”\n“How am | careless of my powers?”\n“How are you employing them?” he countered.\nHis question slashed through to her own misgivings. She took her hand away from the knife, asked: “Why do you say my brother was destroying himself?”\n“Oh, come now, child! Where are these vaunted powers? Have you no ability to reason?”\nControlling anger, she said: “Reason for me, mentat.”\n“Very well.” He glanced around at their escort, returned his attention to their course. The plain of Arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern rim of the Shield Wall. The pattern of the pan and graben villages remained indistinct beneath a dust pall, but the distant gleam of Arrakeen could be discerned.\n“Symptoms,” he said. “Your brother keeps an official Panegyrist who—”\n“Who was a gift of the Fremen Naibs!”\n“An\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is a central figure in the narrative, possibly a leader or significant individual, who is concerned with uncovering truths and has a sister named Alia.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is Paul's sister, a Reverend Mother with pre-birth awareness, possessing the memories of her mother and other Reverend Mothers.
