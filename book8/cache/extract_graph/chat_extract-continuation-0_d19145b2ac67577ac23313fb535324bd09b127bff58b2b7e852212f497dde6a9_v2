这是一个圆形场地，周围是高台，高台上似乎还有人在欢呼着，只是听不清楚。环视一周，蓝轩宇发现，在四周的墙壁上，有四个铁门，不知道是做什么的。\n\n    “这是初级训练场景的斗兽场，我们接下来要面对至少五十头十年魂兽和三头百年魂兽。如果通不过，钱就白给了。如果赢了，钱可以拿回来，还有一枚斗罗币奖励。一定要赢啊！”钱磊快速的解释着眼前的情况。\n\n    五十头十年魂兽加三头百年魂兽？\n\n    蓝轩宇吓了一跳，他上次在模拟舱虽然也面对了百年，甚至是千年的魂兽，可数量却没这么多。\n\n    正在这时，周围的四个铁门已经同时打开，伴随着一声声低沉的咆哮，一道道身影已经风驰电掣般从里面冲了出来。\n\n    那是一头头身长一米二左右的狗类魂兽。蓝轩宇只看了一眼，就认出了他们的身份。\n\n    这是熔岩犬。一种实力相当不弱的狗类魂兽，天赋技能火，在奔腾的过程中，它们身上已经有火焰冒出。\n\n    熔岩犬本身就是群居魂兽，一下冲出来五十头十年修为的熔岩犬，这斗兽场内的温度都迅速的在升高了。\n\n    熔岩犬速度快、力量大，虽然没有什么远程攻击手段，但却悍不畏死再加上自身有温度极高的火焰，一下这么多，可是不好对付的啊！\n\n    就在这时，他身边的刘锋和钱磊都已经有了反应。他们显然都不是第一次面对这种情况了，刘锋右手一抬，脚下一个黄色魂环就升了起来，与此同时，掌心之中白光一闪，一柄丈二长枪出现在掌握之中。\n\n    枪身雪白，隐隐有鳞片形纹路，枪头是龙头状，龙舌吐出，是为枪尖。正是他的武魂，白龙枪。\n\n    钱磊也同样释放出了自己的武魂，一圈黄色魂环从脚下升起，与此同时，他的双眸突然变得绿油油的，整个人似乎也多了一种有些诡异的气息，仿佛有什么特殊的能量波动正从身上向外释放着。\n\n    右手一弹，一枚金色的钱币就出现在了掌中，正是那召唤金钱。\n\n    三人呈犄角站立，钱磊大叫一声，“拼人品的时候到了，出来吧，我的召唤之门。”\n\n    身上的黄色魂环光芒一闪，手中召唤金钱向空中抛去。\n\n    顿时，召唤金钱冒出一股绿光，本身开始放大，绿色光芒从两侧向下流淌，一直到地面，化为一扇门户的样子。整个召唤金钱都是绿光大放，诡异的能量波动令门内顿时变得一片幽深。\n\n    蓝轩宇扭头看了他一眼\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
