马遵正欲起兵，忽一人自外而入曰：“太守中诸葛亮之计矣！”众视之，乃天水冀人也，姓姜名维，字伯约。父名囧，昔日曾为天水郡功曹，因羌人乱，没于王事。维自幼博览群书，兵法武艺，无所不通；奉母至孝，郡人敬之；后为中郎将，就参本郡军事。当日姜维谓马遵曰：“近闻诸葛亮杀败夏侯楙，困于南安，水泄不通，安得有人自重围之中而出？又且裴绪乃无名下将，从不曾见；况安定报马，又无公文，以此察之，此人乃蜀将诈称魏将。赚得太守出城，料城中无备，必然暗伏一军于左近，乘虚而取天水也，”马遵大悟曰：“非伯约之言，则误中奸计矣！”维笑曰：“太守放心。某有一计，可擒诸葛亮，解南安之危。”正是：运筹又遇强中手，斗智还逢意外人。未知其计如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第九十三回　姜伯约归降孔明　武乡侯骂死王朝\n\n
