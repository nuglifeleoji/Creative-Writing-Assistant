She serves as a **key advisor** to Mother Superior **Odrade**, participating in **strategic discussions, internal politics, and critical decision-making** within the Sisterhood. A **conservative** figure, she frequently **opposes changes to tradition**, distrusts the **Mentat-ghola Duncan Idaho**, and **advocates against alliances with the Tleilaxu**.  \n\nAs a **Mentat-Archivist**, Bellonda is deeply involved in **administrative duties, archival work, and intelligence analysis**, including **monitoring Idaho’s activities** and **briefing Teg** on Face Dancer threats and historical records. She **questions Odrade’s leadership**, often **expressing skepticism** about the Sisterhood’s direction, yet remains **loyal** despite their conflicts.  \n\nBellonda plays a **pivotal role in Murbella’s transformation**, assisting in her **Agony** and guiding her through **Bene Gesserit teachings**, though she **doubts Murbella’s commitment**. She also **monitors Odrade**, **delays orders strategically**, and **communicates urgent intelligence**, such as **spice blow events** and **sandworm activity**.  \n\nHer personality is **caustic, no-nonsense, and sometimes vicious**, with a **logical yet emotionally charged** approach. She **rebels against frivolity**, despises **Sheeana’s influence** (though it improves her appearance), and **challenges historical interpretations**. Despite her **admonishing tone**, she is a **respected watchdog**, ensuring discipline and **enforcing Sisterhood protocols**.  \n\nIn summary, Bellonda is a **complex, formidable figure**—**analytical yet volatile, conservative yet indispensable**—balancing **archival rigor, political dissent, and unwavering service** to the Bene Gesserit.
