From that Holy Hoard, the priesthood possessed God’s own voice, His printed words and even holophotos. Everything was explained and they knew that the desert surface of Rakis reproduced the original form of the planet, the way it looked in the beginning when it was the only known source of the Holy Spice.\n“She asks about God’s family,” Stiros said. “Why should she have to ask about—”\n“She tests us. Do we give Them Their proper places? The Reverend Mother Jessica to her son, Muad’Dib, to his son, Leto II—the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven.”\n“Leto Ill,” Stiros muttered. “What of the other Leto who died at Sardaukar hands? What of him?”\n“Careful, Stiros,” Tuek intoned. “You know my great- grandfather pronounced upon that question from this very bench. Our Divided God was reincarnated with part of Him remaining in heaven to mediate the Ascendancy. That part of Him became nameless then, as the True Essence of God should always be!”\n“Oh?”\nTuek heard the terrible cynicism in the old man’s voice. Stiros’ words seemed to tremble in the incense-laden air, inviting terrible retribution.\n“Then why does she ask how our Leto was transformed into the Divided God?” Stiros demanded.\nDid Stiros question the Holy Metamorphosis? Tuek was aghast. He said: “In time, she will enlighten us.”\n“Our feeble explanations must fill her with dismay,” Stiros sneered.\n“You go too far, Stiros!”\n“Indeed? You do not think it enlightening that she asks how the sandtrout encapsulate most of Rakis’ water and re- create the desert?”\nTuek tried to conceal his growing anger. Stiros did represent a powerful faction in the priesthood, but his tone and his words raised questions that had been answered by High Priests long ago. The Metamorphosis of Leto II had given birth to uncounted sandtrout, each carrying a Bit of Himself. Sandtrout to Divided God: The sequence was known and worshiped. To question this denied God.\n“You sit here and do nothing!” Stiros accused. “We are pawns of—”\n“Enough!” Tuek had heard all he wanted to hear of this old man’s cynicism. Drawing his dignity around him, Tuek spoke the words of God:\n“Your Lord knows very well what is in your heart. Your soul suffices this day as a reckoner against you. | need no witnesses. You do not listen to your soul, but listen instead to your anger and your rage.”\nStiros retired in frustration.\nAfter considerable thought, Tuek enrobed himself in his most suitable finery of white, gold, and purple. He went to visit Sheeana.\nSheeana was in the roof garden atop the central priestly complex, there with Cania and two others—a young priest named Baldik, who was in Tuek’s private service, and an acolyte priestess named Kipuna, who behaved too much like a Reverend Mother for Tuek’s liking. The Sisterhood had its spies here, of course, but Tuek did not like to be aware of it. Kipuna had taken over much of Sheeana’s physical training and there had grown a rapport between child and acolyte priestess that aroused Cania’s jealousy. Even Cania, however, could not stand in the way of Sheeana’s commands.\nThe four of them stood beside a stone bench almost in the shadow of a ventilator tower. Kipuna held Sheeana’s right hand, manipulating the child’s fingers. Sheeana was growing tall, Tuek noted. Six years she had been his charge. He could see the first beginnings of breasts poking out her robe. There was not a breath of wind on the rooftop and the air felt heavy in Tuek’s lungs.\nTuek glanced around the garden to assure himself that his security arrangements were not being ignored. One never knew from what quarter danger might appear. Four of Tuek’s own personal guards, well armed but concealing it, shared the rooftop at a distance—one at each corner. The parapet enclosing the garden was a high one, just the guards’ heads standing above the rim. The only building higher than this priestly tower was Keen’s primary windtrap about a thousand meters to the west.\nDespite the visible evidence that his security orders were being carried out, Tuek sensed danger. Was God warning him? Tuek still felt disturbed by Stiros’ cynicism. Was it wrong to allow Stiros that much latitude?\nSheeana saw Tuek approaching and stopped the odd finger-flexing exercises she was performing at Kipuna’s instructions. Giving every appearance of knowledgeable patience, the child stood silently with her gaze fixed on the High Priest, forcing her companions to turn and watch with her.\nSheeana did not find Tuek a fearsome figure. She rather liked the old man although some of his questions were so bumbling. And his answers! Quite by accident, she had discovered the question that most disturbed Tuek.\n“Why?”\nSome of the attendant priests interpreted her question aloud as: “Why do you believe this?” Sheeana immediately picked up on this and thereafter her probings of Tuek and the others took the unvarying form:\n“Why do you believe this?”\nTuek stopped about two paces from Sheeana and bowed. “Good afternoon, Sheeana.” He twisted his neck nervously against the collar of his robe. The sun felt hot on his shoulders and he wondered why the child chose to be out here so often.\nSheeana maintained her probing stare at Tuek. She knew this gaze disturbed him.\nTuek cleared his throat. When Sheeana looked at him that way, he always wondered: /s it God looking at me through her eyes?\nCania spoke. “Sheeana has been asking today about the Fish Speakers.”\nIn his most unctuous tones, Tuek said: “God’s own Holy Army.”\n“All of them women?” Sheeana asked. She spoke as though she could not believe it. To those at the base of Rakian society, Fish Speakers were a name from ancient history, people cast out in the Famine Times.\nShe is testing me, Tuek thought. Fish Speakers. The modern carriers of the name had only a small trading-spying delegation on Rakis, composed of both men and women. Their ancient origins no longer were significant to their current activities, mostly working as an arm of Ix.\n“Men always served the Fish Speakers in an advisory Capacity,” Tuek said. He watched carefully to see how Sheeana would respond.\n“Then there were always the Duncan Idahos,” Cania said.\n“Yes, yes, of course: the Duncans.” Tuek tried not to scowl. That woman was always interrupting! Tuek did not like being reminded of this aspect to God’s historical presence on Rakis. The recurrent ghola and his position in the Holy Army carried overtones of Bene Tleilax indulgence. But there was no avoiding the fact that Fish Speakers had guarded the Duncans from harm, acting of course at the behest of God. The Duncans were holy, no doubt of it, but in a special category. By God’s own account, He had killed\nsome of the Duncans himself, obviously trans/ating them immediately into heaven.\n“Kipuna had been telling me about the Bene Gesserit,” Sheeana said.\nHow the child’s mind darted around!\nTuek cleared his throat, recognizing his own ambivalent attitude toward the Reverend Mothers. Reverence was demanded for those who were “Beloved of God,” such as the Saintly Chenoeh. And the first High Priest had constructed a logical account of how the Holy Hwi Noree, Bride of God, had been a secret Reverend Mother. Honoring these special circumstances, the priesthood felt an irritating responsibility toward the Bene Gesserit, which was carried out chiefly by selling melange to the Sisterhood at a price ridiculously below that charged by the Tleilaxu.\nIn her most ingenuous tones, Sheeana said: “Tell me about the Bene Gesserit, Hedley.”\nTuek glanced sharply at the adults around Sheeana, trying to catch a smile on their faces. He did not know how to deal with Sheeana calling him by his first name that way. In one sense, it was demeaning. In another sense, she honored him by such intimacy.\nGod tests me sorely, he thought.\n“Are the Reverend Mothers good people?” Sheeana asked.\nTuek sighed. The records all confirmed that God harbored reservations about the Sisterhood. God’s words had been examined carefully and submitted finally to a High Priest’s interpretation. God did not let the Sisterhood threaten his Golden Path. That much was clear.\n“Many of them are good,” Tuek said.\n“Where is the nearest Reverend Mother?” Sheeana asked.\n“At the Sisterhood’s Embassy here in Keen,” Tuek said.\n“Do you know her?”\n“There are many Reverend Mothers in the Bene Gesserit Keep,” he said.\n“What’s a Keep?”\n“That’s what they call their home here.”\n“One Reverend Mother must be in charge. Do you know that one?”\n“I knew her predecessor, Tamalane, but this one is new. She has only just arrived. Her name is Odrade.”\n“That’s a funny name.”\nTuek’s own thought, but he said: “One of our historians tells me it is a form of the name Atreides.”\nSheeana reflected upon this. Atreides. That was the family that had brought Shaitan into being. Before the Atreides there had been only the Fremen and Shai-hulud. The Oral History, which her people preserved against all priestly prohibition, chanted the begats of the most important people on Rakis. Sheeana had heard these names many nights in her village.\n“Muad’Dib begat the Tyrant.”\n“The Tyrant begat Shaitan.”\nSheeana did not feel like arguing truth with Tuek. Anyway, he looked tired today. She said merely: “Bring me this Reverend Mother Odrade.”\nKipuna hid a gloating smile behind her hand.\nTuek stepped back, aghast. How could he comply with such a demand? Even the Rakian priesthood did not command the Bene Gesserit! What if the Sisterhood refused him? Could he offer a gift of melange in exchange? That might be a sign of weakness. The Reverend Mothers might bargain! No harder bargainers lived than the Sisterhood’s cold-eyed Reverend Mothers. This new one, this Odrade, looked to be one of the worst.\nAll of these thoughts fled through Tuek’s mind in an instant.\nCania intruded, giving Tuek the needed approach. “Perhaps Kipuna could convey Sheeana’s invitation,” Cania said.\nTuek darted a glance at the young acolyte priestess. Yes! Many suspected (Cania among them, obviously) that Kipuna\nspied for the Bene Gesserit. Of course, everyone on Rakis spied for someone. Tuek put on his most gracious smile as he nodded to Kipuna.\n“Do you know any of the Reverend Mothers, Kipuna?”\n“Some of them are known to me, My Lord High Priest,” Kipuna said.\nAt least she still shows the proper deference!\n“Excellent,” Tuek said. “Would you be so kind as to start this gracious invitation from Sheeana moving up through the Sisterhood’s embassy.”\n“I will do my poor best, My Lord High\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6c363fad90a07b48a41b07296edb3c33b1512435248f916f8a9ba620ff63a16d_v2"}
