开宴会。\n　　以后的几天都和这一天类似。孩子们首先感到惊讶：大人们居然留下来那么多东西，那么多好吃的和好玩的！然后感到不解：理想世界是那么近，过去为什么爸爸妈妈们不让我们走进它呢？现在，孩子们忘记了一切，即使在全民大会上多少有一些理智的那些大孩子们，对未来的忧虑现在也被狂欢冲得烟消云散。这是历史上最无忧无虑的时候，整个国家成了一个孩子乐园。\n　　FG每天举行一次全民表决，只是决定第二天电视中放什么节目，从糖城时代的第二天起，电视每天24小时不间断播放，内容全部是动画片、科幻片和武侠片。\n　　以下是一个男孩儿在二十年后对这段时光的回忆：\n　　那几天我睡得很少，身体的每个细胞都处于高度兴奋之中。每天清晨天刚蒙蒙亮我就醒来了，我这时总觉得有个声音在叫醒我：“哈哈，快看，又一天来了！”\n　　每天第一次走出家门来到清凉的晨风中时，我都有一种鸟儿飞出窝的美妙感觉。这时我是完全自由的，没有任何纪律限制我，没有任何作业要完成，想去哪儿就去哪儿，想玩什么就玩什么。记得那几天的上午我们这些男孩子玩的都是一些运动很剧烈的游戏，小些的孩子玩打仗游戏和捉迷藏，我曾和他们玩过一次，那些小家伙们一旦藏起来你就别想找到他们，因为城市里的任何地方他们都可以进去。我们这些十岁左右的大孩子则玩开汽车（那都是真的汽车！）、踢足球、在大街正中滑旱冰等。孩子们都玩儿得很卖力，因为他们除了玩之外还有一个目的：为午宴做准备。那几天吃的太好了，但好吃的还远远没有享受完。每天上午，孩子们尽最大努力把能量消耗在游戏中，他们最大的愿望就是在近12点时兴高彩烈地对自己说一声：“我饿了！”\n　　在11点，城市里的游戏停止了，12点，孩子们的午宴开始了。城市里有数不清的宴会点，我很快发现总在同一个宴会点吃是不明智的，因为每个点的吃的大多是从同一个仓库中运来的，不免有些单调。但体育场宴会点是个例外，那是这个城市里最大的一个宴会点，每天有一万多人参加！但食物更多。走进体育场，就像走进一个迷宫，那迷宫的墙是用罐头和糕点筑起来的！如果不留神，你会被脚下一堆堆的精美糖果绊倒。有一天，我在高处的观众席上向下看，只见黑压压的孩子涌进堆在宽阔草坪上的食物山，就像一大群蚂蚁涌上一大块奶油蛋糕一样。每天的宴会后，食物山总要低一些，但下午又被运送食品的孩子们堆高了……那个宴会场我去过几次，渐渐积累了一\n######################\nOutput:",
