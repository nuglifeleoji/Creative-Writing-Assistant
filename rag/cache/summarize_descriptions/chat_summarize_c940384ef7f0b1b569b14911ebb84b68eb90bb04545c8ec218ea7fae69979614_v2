The planet's intentionally severe environment was designed to mimic the extreme conditions of Salusa Secundus, ensuring that Bene Gesserit trainees developed the resilience and discipline required for their order. Additionally, AL DHANAB housed a creche, further emphasizing its role as a centralized hub for the Bene Gesserit's educational and indoctrination programs.
