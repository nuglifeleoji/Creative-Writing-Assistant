��了半天，才使屏幕上显出影像来。戴维看到沃恩站在办公室墙上的世界地图前，一动不动地沉思着。在几个孩子好奇的目光中，小总统在狭窄的地下室中来回踱着步，有时又突然停下，直勾勾地望着屏幕，就像在圣诞之夜望着一个迟迟不肯打开礼品袋的圣诞老人一样。一个小时过去了，又一个小时过去了……一直到了中午，沃恩还是像塑像一样站在那里。戴维失去了耐心，对值班的孩子们交待了一下，命令他们沃恩一有什么动静就立刻叫他。\n　　“他是危险分子吗？”一个屁股后面挂着一支大号左轮的小特工好奇地问。\n　　“对美国来说不是。”\n　　戴维回到自己的住处，心不在焉地吃了午饭，由于昨天一夜几乎没睡，睡意一下子涌了上来。他整整睡了一下午，醒来时，天已黑了。他急忙拿起电话问沃恩的事，地下室中值班的孩子告诉他，沃恩整整在地图前整整站了一天，一动不动。这期间他只自言自语了一句话：\n　　“上帝啊，给我维格纳的灵感吧！”\n　　戴维急忙把几个小顾问招集来研究这句话。小顾问告诉他，维格纳是本世纪初的一位地理学家，德国人。有一次他生病在床，百无聊懒地盯着墙上的世界地图看，突然发现地球上几块大陆的边缘的曲线是互相吻合的，这使他产生了一个想法：远古时代的地球表面可能只有一个大陆，后来这个大陆在未知的力量作用下分裂开来，各部分在地球表面向不同的方向漂移，才形成了现在的世界。维格纳由此创立了地球科学史上划时代的大陆漂移学说。戴维这才知道沃恩的这句话没有什么神秘之处，他只是苦于得不到那样的灵感，以创立政治上的\"大陆漂移说\"而已。戴维把小顾问们打发走，又上床睡了……\n　　美洲大陆在戴维脚下轰地分开，他向深渊坠下去，他以为自己要掉进大洋了，但突然发现下面不是大洋，是一片无边无际的人海，那是中国孩子的军队，每一个小士兵都举着上刺刀的步枪，刀尖向上迎接着他……\n　　戴维大叫一声从恶梦中惊醒，一看表已是凌晨一点多。他抓起电话拨通地下室，得知椭圆形办公室中的那个怪孩子仍一动不动地站着！“我怀疑他是不是就那么死了。”一个值班特工说。戴维让把图像转到他的房间里来，他看到一束惨白的月光射进办公室的窗子，正好照在沃恩身上，在那朦朦胧胧的地图和国旗前，他好像一个幽灵。戴维叹息了一下，关上电视又睡了。\n　　小总统一直睡到了天色微亮，电话铃吵醒了他。\n　　“总统，办公�\n######################\nOutput:",
