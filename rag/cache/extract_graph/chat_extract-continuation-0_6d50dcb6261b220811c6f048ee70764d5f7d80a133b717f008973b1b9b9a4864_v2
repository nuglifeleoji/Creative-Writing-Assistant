They never agree.”\n“I must study this more carefully, Lord.”\n“Ultimately, it rules by guilt because hypocrisy brings on the witch hunt and the demand for scapegoats.”\n“Shocking, Lord.”\nThe cortege rounded a corner where the rock had been opened for a glimpse of the bridge in the distance.\n“Moneo, are you paying close attention to me?”\n“Yes, Lord. Indeed.”\n“I’m describing a tool of the religious power base.”\n“| recognize that, Lord.”\n“Then why are you so afraid?”\n“Talk of religious power always makes me uneasy, Lord.”\n“Because you and the Fish Speakers wield it in my name?”\n“Of course, Lord.”\n“Power bases are very dangerous because they attract people who are truly insane, people who seek power only for the sake of power. Do you understand?”\n“Yes, Lord. That is why you so seldom grant petitions for appointments in your government.”\n“Excellent, Moneo!”\n“Thank you, Lord.”\n“In the shadow of every religion lurks a Torquemada,” Leto said. “You have never encountered that name. | know because | caused it to be expunged from all the records.”\n“Why was that, Lord?”\n“He was an obscenity. He made living torches out of people who disagreed with him.”\nMoneo pitched his voice low. “Like the historians who angered you, Lord?”\n“Do you question my actions, Moneo?”\n“No, Lord!”\n“Good. The historians died peacefully. Not a one felt the flames. Torquemada, however, delighted in commending to his god the agonized screams of his burning victims.”\n“How horrible, Lord.”\nThe cortege turned another corner with a view of the bridge. The span appeared to be no closer.\nOnce more, Moneo studied his God Emperor. The Worm appeared no closer. Still too close, though. Moneo could feel the menace of that unpredictable presence, the Holy Presence which could kill without warning.\nMoneo shuddered.\nWhat had been the meaning of that strange .. . sermon? Moneo knew that few had ever heard the God Emperor speak thus. It was a privilege and a burden. It was part of the price paid for Leto’s Peace. Generation after generation marched in their ordered way under the dictates of that peace. Only the Citadel’s inner circle knew all of the infrequent breaks in that peace—the incidents when Fish Speakers were sent out in anticipation of violence.\nAnticipation!\nMoneo glanced at the now-silent Leto. The God Emperor’s eyes were closed and a look of brooding had come over his face. That was another of the Worm signs—a bad one. Moneo trembled.\nDid Leto anticipate even his own moments of wild violence? It was the anticipation of violence which sent tremors of awe and fear throughout the Empire. Leto knew where guards must be posted to put down a transitory uprising. He knew it before the event.\nEven thinking about such matters dried Moneo’s mouth. There were times, Moneo believed, when the God Emperor could read any mind. Oh, Leto employed spies. An occasional shrouded figure passed by the Fish Speakers for the climb to Leto’s tower aerie or descended to the crypt. Spies, no doubt of it, but Moneo suspected they were used merely to confirm what Leto already knew.\nAs though to confirm the fears in Moneo’s mind, Leto said: “Do not try to force an understanding of my ways, Moneo. Let understanding come of itself.”\n“I will try, Lord.”\n“No, do not try. Tell me, instead, if you have announced yet that there will be no changes in the spice allotments?”\n“Not yet, Lord.”\n“Delay the announcement. | am changing my mind. You know, of course, that there will be new offers of bribes.”\nMoneo sighed. The amounts offered him in bribes had reached ridiculous heights. Leto, however, had appeared amused by the escalation.\n“Draw them out,” he had said earlier. “See how high they will go. Make it appear that you can be bribed at last.”\nNow, as they turned another corner with a view of the bridge, Leto asked: “Has House Corrino offered you a bribe?”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“Do you know the myth which says that someday House Corrino will be restored to its ancient powers?”\n“I have heard it, Lord.”\n“Have the Corrino killed. It is a task for the Duncan. We will test him.”\n“So soon, Lord?”\n“It is still Known that melange can extend human life. Let it also be known that the spice can shorten life.”\n“AS you command, Lord.”\nMoneo knew this response in himself. It was the way he spoke when he could not voice a deep objection which he felt. He also knew that the Lord Leto understood this and was amused by it. The amusement rankled.\n“Try not to be impatient with me, Moneo,” Leto said. Moneo suppressed his feeling of bitterness. Bitterness brought peril. Rebels were bitter. The Duncans grew bitter\nbefore they died.\n“Time has a different meaning for you than it has for me, Lord,” Moneo said. “I wish | could know that meaning.”\n“You could but you will not.”\nMoneo heard rebuke in the words and fell silent, turning his thoughts instead to the melange problems. It was not often that the Lord Leto spoke of the spice, and then it usually was to set allotments or withdraw them, to apportion rewards or send the Fish Speakers after some newly revealed hoard. The greatest remaining store of spice, Moneo knew, lay in some place known only to the God Emperor. In his first days of Royal Service, Moneo had been covered in a hood and led by the Lord Leto himself to that secret place along twisting passages which Moneo had sensed were underground.\nWhen I removed the hood, we were underground.\nThe place had filled Moneo with awe. Great bins of melange lay all around in a gigantic room cut from native rock and illuminated by glowglobes of an ancient design with arabesques of metal scrollwork upon them. The spice had glowed radiant blue in the dim silver light. And the smell—bitter cinnamon, unmistakable. There had been water dripping nearby. Their voices had echoed against the stone.\n“One day all of this will be gone,” the Lord Leto had said.\nShocked, Moneo had asked: “What will the Guild and Bene Gesserit do then?”\n“What they are doing now, but more violently.”\nStaring around the gigantic room with its enormous store of melange, Moneo could only think of things he knew were happening in the Empire at that moment—bloody assassinations, piratical raids, spying and intrigue. The God Emperor kept a lid on the worst of it, but what remained was bad enough.\n“The temptation,” Moneo whispered.\n“The temptation, indeed.”\n“Will there be no more melange, ever, Lord?”\n“Someday, | will go back into the sand. | will be the source of spice then.”\n“You, Lord?”\n“And | will produce something just as wonderful—more sandtrout—a hybrid and a prolific breeder.”\nTrembling at this revelation, Moneo stared at the shadowy figure of the God Emperor who spoke of such marvels.\n“The sandtrout,” Lord Leto said, “will link themselves into large living bubbles to enclose this planet’s water deep underground. Just as it was in the Dune times.”\n“All of the water, Lord?”\n“Most of it. Within three hundred years, the sandworm once more will reign here. It will be a new kind of sandworm, | promise you.”\n“How is that, Lord?”\n“It will have animal awareness and a new cunning. The spice will be more dangerous to seek and far more perilous to keep.”\nMoneo had looked up at the cavern’s rocky ceiling, his imagination probing through the rock to the surface.\n“Everything desert again, Lord?”\n“Watercourses will fill with sand. Crops will be choked and killed. Trees will be covered by great moving dunes. The sand-death will spread until... until a subtle signal is heard in the barren lands.”\n“What signal, Lord?”\n“The signal for the next cycle, the coming of the Maker, the coming of Shai-Hulud.”\n“Will that be you, Lord?”\n“Yes! The great sandworm of Dune will rise once more from the deeps. This land will be again the domain of spice and worm.”\n“But what of the people, Lord? All of the people?”\n“Many will die. Food plants and the abundant growth of this land will be parched. Without nourishment, meat animals will die.”\n“Will everyone go hungry, Lord?”\n“Undernourishment and the old diseases will stalk the land, while only the hardiest survive... the hardiest and most brutal.”\n“Must that be, Lord?”\n“The alternatives are worse.”\n“Teach me about those alternatives, Lord.”\n“In time, you will know them.”\nAs he marched beside the God Emperor in the morning light of their peregrination to Onn, Moneo could only admit that he had, indeed, learned of alternative evils.\nTo most of the Empire’s docile citizens, Moneo knew, the firm knowledge which he held in his own head lay concealed in the Oral History, in the myths and wild stories told by infrequent mad prophets who cropped up on one planet or another to gather a short-lived following.\nBut I know what the Fish Speakers do.\nAnd he knew also about evil men who sat at table, gorging themselves on rare delicacies while they watched the torture of fellow humans.\nUntil the Fish Speakers came, and gore erased such scenes.\n“| enjoyed the way your daughter watched me,” Leto said. “She was so unaware that | knew.”\n“Lord, | fear for her! She is my blood, my...”\n“Mine, too, Moneo. Am | not Atreides? You would be better employed fearing for yourself.”\nMoneo cast a fearful glance along the God Emperor’s body. The signs of the Worm remained too near. Moneo glanced at the cortege following, then along the road ahead. They now were into the steep descent, the switchbacks short and cut into high walls in the man-piled rocks of the cliff barrier which girdled the Sareer.\n“Siona does not offend me, Moneo.”\n“But she...”\n“Moneo! Here, in its mysterious capsule is one of life’s great secrets. To be surprised, to have a new thing occur, that is what | desire most.”\n“Lord, |...”\n“New! Isn’t that a radiant, a wonderful word?”\n“If you say it, Lord.”\nLeto was forced to remind himself then: Moneo is my creature. | created him.\n“Your child is worth almost any price to me, Moneo. You decry her companions, but there may be one among them that she will love.”\nMoneo cast an involuntary glance back at Duncan Idaho marching with the guards. Idaho was glaring ahead as though trying to probe each turn in the road before they reached it. He did not like this place with its high walls all around from which attack might come. Idaho had sent scouts up there in the night and Moneo knew that some of them still lurked on the heights, but there also were\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a powerful and enigmatic ruler with control over spice and the empire, known for his unpredictable nature and deep insights into power and religion.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a loyal servant of Leto, often fearful and contemplative, tasked with carrying out the God Emperor's commands and managing spice allotments.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are a military and religious order that enforces Leto's will, often involved in suppressing violence and maintaining order.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Corrino is a noble family with ambitions to restore its ancient powers, often involved in political intrigue and bribery.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a trusted agent of Leto, often tasked with dangerous missions, including assassinations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with deep influence over politics and religion, often in conflict with Leto's rule.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Guild is a powerful organization controlling space travel and commerce, heavily dependent on spice.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONN<|>GEO<|>Onn is a location where Leto and his cortege are traveling, part of the empire's geography.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARER<|>GEO<|>The Sareer is a desert region with high cliffs and barriers, part of the empire's harsh landscape.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune is a legendary desert planet, the original source of spice and sandworms, central to the empire's history.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>EVENT<|>Shai-Hulud refers to the coming of the great sandworm, a prophesied event marking a new cycle of spice and desert dominance.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>LETO<|>Moneo is a loyal servant and advisor to Leto, often fearful of his unpredictable nature<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>LETO<|>The Fish Speakers enforce Leto's will and maintain order in the empire<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>LETO<|>House Corrino seeks to restore its power, often clashing with Leto's rule<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LETO<|>Duncan Idaho is a trusted agent of Leto, often tasked with dangerous missions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>LETO<|>The Bene Gesserit often conflicts with Leto's rule, seeking their own political and religious goals<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUILD<|>LETO<|>The Guild depends on spice, which Leto controls, creating a tense relationship<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUNE<|>Leto prophesies the return of Dune's desert and sandworms, linking his rule to the planet's history<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>Leto identifies himself with the coming of Shai-Hulud, the great sandworm<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Moneo oversees the Fish Speakers and their actions in the empire<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>Duncan Idaho is tasked with assassinating members of House Corrino<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
