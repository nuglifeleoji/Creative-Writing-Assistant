\n　　他们好不容易到了掌子面煤溜子机尾旁边。王世才象猴子一般灵巧地穿过那些看起来摇摇欲坠的钢梁铁柱，到机头那边让溜子停下来。震耳欲聋的巨大的响声停歇了。他们在这头稍事停留，等待王世才返回。 \n　　掌子面一荐炮刚过，顶棚已经支护好了。正在攉煤的工人也暂时停下来。他们知道这是来参观的人。因为班长亲自带路，还跟着矿上的领导和安检员，知道参观的是个“大人物”。安锁子似乎知道来的是谁，不过，这家伙今天倒也没说什么粗话，而且把屁股上开洞的破裤子也穿上了。溜子停下一会后，王世才又象猴子一样从溜槽上爬过来。“走吧！”他有黑暗中招呼大家说。

\n　　他放开了她的手。他和师傅目送着他们离开村料场。 \n　　一直到巷道拐弯处时，她又回过头来，在一片漆黑中徒劳地寻找他的身影。她看见远处有灯光在晃动。她无力地举起自己手中的矿灯，摆动了几下——这是最后的告别……晓霞不知道自己是怎样上井的。
