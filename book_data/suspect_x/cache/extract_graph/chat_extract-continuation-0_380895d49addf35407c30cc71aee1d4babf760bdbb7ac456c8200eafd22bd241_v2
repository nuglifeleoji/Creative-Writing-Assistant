Late spring and already fruit beginning to form out there. Rebirth. A new Teg was born today! No feeling of elation accompanied the thought. Usually she found the view restorative but not this morning.\nWhat are my real strengths? What are my facts?\nThe resources at a Mother Superior’s command were formidable: profound loyalty in those who served her, a military arm under a Teg-trained Bashar (far away now with a large portion of their troops guarding the school planet, Lampadas), artisans and technicians, spies and agents throughout the Old Empire, countless workers who looked to the Sisterhood to protect them from Honored Matres, and all the Reverend Mothers with Other Memories reaching into the dawn of life.\nOdrade knew without false pride that she represented the peak of what was strongest in a Reverend Mother. If her personal memories did not provide needed information, she had others around her to fill the gaps. Machine-stored data as well, although she admitted to a native distrust of it.\nOdrade found herself tempted to go digging in those other lives she carried as secondary memory—these subterranean layers of awareness. Perhaps she could find brilliant solutions to their predicament in experiences of Others. Dangerous! You could lose yourself for hours, fascinated by the multiplicity of human variations. Better to leave Other Memories balanced in there, ready on demand or intruding out of necessity. Consciousness, that was the fulcrum and her grip on identity.\nDuncan Idaho’s odd Mentat metaphor helped.\nSelf-awareness: facing mirrors that pass through the universe, gathering new images on the way—endlessly reflexive. The infinite seen as finite, the analogue of consciousness carrying the sensed bits of infinity.\nShe had never heard words come closer to her wordless awareness. “Specialized complexity,” Idaho called it. “We gather, assemble, and reflect our systems of order.”\nIndeed, it was the Bene Gesserit view that humans were life designed by evolution to create order.\nAnd how does that help us against these disorderly women who hunt us? What branch of evolution are they? Is evolution just another name for God?\nHer Sisters would sneer at such “bootless speculation.”\nStill, there might be answers in Other Memory.\nAhhhh, how seductive!\nHow desperately she wanted to project her beleaguered self into past identities and feel what it had been to live then. The immediate peril of this enticement chilled her. She felt Other Memory crowding the edges of awareness. “/t was like this!” “No! It was more like this!” How greedy they were. You had to pick and choose, discreetly animating the past. And was that not the purpose of consciousness, the very essence of being alive?\nSelect from the past and match it against the present: Learn consequences.\nThat was the Bene Gesserit view of history, ancient Santayana’s words resonating in their lives: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\nThe buildings of Central itself, this most powerful of all Bene Gesserit establishments, reflected that attitude wherever Odrade turned. Usiform, that was the commanding concept. Little about any Bene Gesserit working center was allowed to become non-functional, preserved out of nostalgia. The Sisterhood had no need for archeologists. Reverend Mothers embodied history.\nSlowly (much slower than usual) the view out her high window produced its calming effect. What her eyes reported, that was Bene Gesserit order.\nBut Honored Matres could end that order in the next instant. The Sisterhood’s situation was far worse than what they had suffered under the Tyrant. Many of the decisions she was forced to make now were odious. Her workroom was less agreeable because of actions taken here.\nWrite off our Bene Gesserit Keep on Palma?\nThat suggestion was in Bellonda’s morning report waiting on the worktable. Odrade fixed an affirmative notation to it. “Yes.”\nWrite it off because Honored Matre attack is imminent and we cannot defend them or evacuate them.\nEleven hundred Reverend Mothers and the Fates alone knew how many acolytes, postulants, and others dead or worse because of that one word. Not to mention all of the “Ordinary lives” existing in the Bene Gesserit shadow.\nThe strain of such decisions produced a new kind of weariness in Odrade. Was it a weariness of the soul? Did such a thing as a soul exist? She felt deep fatigue where consciousness could not probe. Weary, weary, weary.\nEven Bellonda showed the strain and Bell feasted on violence. Tamalane alone appeared above it but that did not fool Odrade. Tam had entered the age of superior observation that lay ahead of all Sisters if they survived into it. Nothing mattered then except observations and judgments. Most of this was never uttered except in fleeting expressions on wrinkled features. Tamalane spoke few words these days, her comments so sparse as to be almost ludicrous:\n“Buy more no-ships.”\n“Brief Sheeana.”\n“Review Idaho records.”\n“Ask Murbella.”\nSometimes, only grunts issued from her, as though words might betray her.\nAnd always the hunters roamed out there, sweeping space for any clue to the location of Chapterhouse.\nIn her most private thoughts, Odrade saw the no-ships of Honored Matres as corsairs on those infinite seas between the stars. They flew no black flags with skull and crossbones, but that flag was there nonetheless. Nothing whatsoever romantic about them. Kill and pillage! Amass\nyour wealth in the blood of others. Drain that energy and build your killer no-ships on ways lubricated with blood.\nAnd they did not see they would drown in red lubricant if they kept on this course.\nThere must be furious people out there in that human Scattering where Honored Matres originated, people who live out their lives with a single fixed idea: Get them!\nIt was a dangerous universe where such ideas were allowed to float around freely. Good civilizations took care that such ideas did not gain energy, did not even get a chance for birth. When they did occur, by chance or accident, they were to be diverted quickly because they tended to gather mass.\nOdrade was astonished that the Honored Matres did not see this or, seeing it, ignored it.\n“Full-blown hysterics,” Tamalane called them.\n“Xenophobia,” Bellonda disagreed, always correcting, as though control of Archives gave her a better hold on reality.\nBoth were right, Odrade thought. The Honored Matres behaved hysterically. All outsiders were the enemy. The only people they appeared to trust were the men they sexually enslaved, and those only to a limited degree. Constantly testing, according to Murbella (our only captive Honored Matre), to see if their hold was firm.\n“Sometimes out of mere pique they may eliminate someone just as an example to others.” Murbella’s words and they forced the question: Are they making an example of us? “See! This is what happens to those who dare oppose us!”\nMurbella had said, “You’ve aroused them. Once aroused, they will not desist until they have destroyed you.”\nGet the outsiders!\nSingularly direct. A weakness in them if we play it right, Odrade thought.\nXenophobia carried to a ridiculous extreme?\nQuite possibly.\nOdrade pounded a fist on her worktable, aware that the action would be seen and recorded by Sisters who kept constant watch on Mother Superior’s behavior. She spoke aloud then for the omnipresent comeyes and watchdog Sisters behind them.\n“We will not sit and wait in defensive enclaves! We've become as fat as Bellonda (and let her fret over that!) thinking we’ve created an untouchable society and enduring structures.”\nOdrade swept her gaze around the familiar room.\n“This place is one of our weaknesses!”\nShe took her seat behind the worktable thinking (of all things!) about architecture and community planning. Well, that was a Mother Superior’s right!\nSisterhood communities seldom grew at random. Even when they took over existing structures (as they had with the old Harkonnen Keep on Gammu) they did so with rebuilding plans. They wanted pneumotubes to shunt small packages and messages. Lightlines and hardray projectors to transmit encrypted words. They considered themselves masters at safeguarding communications. Acolyte and Reverend Mother couriers (committed to self-destruction rather than betray their superiors) carried the more important messages.\nShe could visualize it out there beyond her window and beyond this planet—her web, superbly organized and manned, each Bene Gesserit an extension of the others. Where Sisterhood survival was concerned, there was an untouchable core of loyalty. Backsliders there might be, some spectacular (as the Lady Jessica, grandmother of the Tyrant), but they slid only so far. Most upsets were temporary.\nAnd all of that was a Bene Gesserit pattern. A weakness.\nOdrade admitted a deep agreement with Bellonda’s fears. But l'Il be damned if | allow such things to depress all joy of\nliving! That would be giving in to the very thing those rampaging Honored Matres wanted.\n“It’s our strengths the hunters want,” Odrade said, looking up at the ceiling comeyes. Like ancient savages eating the hearts of enemies. Well... we will give them something to eat all right! And they will not know until too late that they cannot digest it!\nExcept for preliminary teachings tailored to acolytes and postulants, the Sisterhood did not go in much for admonitory sayings, but Odrade had her own private watchwords: “Someone has to do the plowing.” She smiled to herself as she bent to her work much refreshed. This room, this Sisterhood, these were her garden and there were weeds to be removed, seeds to plant. And fertilizer. Mustn't forget the fertilizer.\nWhen I set out to lead humanity along my Golden Path | promised a lesson their bones would remember. | know a profound pattern humans deny with words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, conditions they call peace. Even as they speak, they create seeds of turmoil and violence.\n—LETO II, THE GOD EMPEROR\nSs? she calls me Spider Queen!\nGreat Honored Matre leaned back in a heavy chair set high on a dais. Her withered breast shook with silent chuckles. She knows what will happen when I get her in my web! Suck her dry, that’s what l'Il do.\nA small woman with unremarkable features and muscles that twitched nervously, she looked down on the skylighted yellow-tile floor of her audience room. A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother sprawled there in shigawire bindings. The captive made no attempt to struggle. Shigawire was excellent for this purpose. Cut her arms off, it would!\nThe chamber where she sat suited Great Honored Matre as much for its dimensions as for the fact that it had been taken from others. Three hundred meters square, it had been designed for convocations of Guild Navigators here on Junction, each Navigator in a monstrous tank. The captive on that yellow floor was a mote in immensity.\nThis weakling took too much joy in revealing what her so- called Superior named me!\nBut it still was a lovely morning, Great Honored Matre thought. Except that no tortures or mental probes worked on these witches. How could you torture someone who might choose to die at any moment\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who expresses fears and concerns about the Sisterhood's situation and is known for her violent tendencies.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, responsible for making difficult decisions and leading the order against threats like the Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a military leader trained by the Bene Gesserit, currently guarding the school planet Lampadas.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a Mentat and a key figure in the Bene Gesserit, known for his unique perspectives and contributions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Tamalane is an elder Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who provides sparse but critical observations and judgments.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a captive Honored Matre who provides insights into the Honored Matres' behavior and strategies.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>PERSON<|>Great Honored Matre is a leader of the Honored Matres, known for her ruthless tactics and desire to destroy the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and ancient sisterhood with profound influence, facing threats from the Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and xenophobic group seeking to destroy the Bene Gesserit and dominate the universe.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL<|>GEO<|>Central is the primary Bene Gesserit establishment, a hub of their operations and power.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMPADAS<|>GEO<|>Lampadas is a school planet guarded by Bene Gesserit troops under Teg's command.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALMA<|>GEO<|>Palma is a Bene Gesserit Keep that is being written off due to an imminent Honored Matre attack.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNCTION<|>GEO<|>Junction is a location where the Honored Matres have taken control, using it as a base for their operations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSTAGE EXCHANGE<|>EVENT<|>An event where hostages are exchanged, though not detailed in this text, it is a recurring theme in the Bene Gesserit's struggles.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BELLONDA<|>Odrade and Bellonda work together as Bene Gesserit leaders, with Bellonda providing reports and Odrade making decisions.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TAMALANE<|>Odrade values Tamalane's sparse but insightful observations and judgments.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Odrade respects Duncan Idaho's Mentat abilities and uses his insights to guide her decisions.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MURBELLA<|>Odrade relies on Murbella's insider knowledge of the Honored Matres to strategize against them.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the order through its current crisis.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres are engaged in a deadly conflict, with the latter seeking to destroy the former.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>LAMPADAS<|>Teg is currently guarding the school planet Lampadas with a large portion of Bene Gesserit troops.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Great Honored Matre is a leader of the Honored Matres, embodying their ruthless tactics.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Great Honored Matre seeks to destroy the Bene Gesserit, viewing them as a primary enemy.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>PALMA<|>The Bene Gesserit are writing off their Keep on Palma due to an imminent Honored Matre attack.<|>7\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
