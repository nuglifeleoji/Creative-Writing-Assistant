亦谏。操方免其死，令乱棒打出。松归馆舍，连夜出城，收拾回川。松自思曰：“吾本欲献西川州郡与曹操，谁想如此慢人！我来时于刘璋之前，开了大口；今日怏怏空回。须被蜀中人所笑。吾闻荆州刘玄德仁义远播久矣，不如径由那条路回。试看此人如何，我自有主见。”于是乘马引仆从望荆州界上而来，前至郢州界口，忽见一队军马，约有五百余骑，为首一员大将，轻妆软扮，勒马前问曰：“来者莫非张别驾乎？”松曰：“然也。”那将慌忙下马，声喏曰：“赵云等候多时。”松下马答礼曰：“莫非常山赵子龙乎？”云曰：“然也，某奉主公刘玄德之命，为大夫远涉路途，鞍马驱驰，特命赵云聊奉酒食。”言罢，军士跪奉酒食，云敬进之。松自思曰：“人言刘玄德宽仁爱客，今果如此。”遂与赵云饮了数杯，上马同行。来到荆州界首，是日天晚，前到馆驿，见驿门外百余人侍立，击鼓相接。一将于马前施礼曰：“奉兄长将令，为大夫远涉风尘，令关某洒扫驿庭，以待歇宿。”松下马，与云长、赵云同入馆舍。讲礼叙坐。须臾，排上酒筵，二人殷勤相劝。饮至更阑，方始罢席，宿了一宵。\n\n    次日早膳毕，上马行不到三五里，只见一簇人马到。乃是玄德引着伏龙、凤雏，亲自来接。遥见张松，早先下马等候。松亦慌忙下马相见。玄德曰：“久闻大夫高名，如雷灌耳。恨云山遥远，不得听教。今闻回都，专此相接。倘蒙不弃，到荒州暂歇片时，以叙渴仰之思，实为万幸！”松大喜，遂上马并辔入城。至府堂上各各叙礼，分宾主依次而坐，设宴款待。饮酒间，玄德只说闲话，并不提起西川之事。松以言挑之曰：“今皇叔守荆州，还有几郡？”孔明答曰：“荆州乃暂借东吴的，每每使人取讨。今我主因是东吴女婿，故权且在此安身。”松曰：“东吴据六郡八十一州，民强国富，犹且不知足耶？”庞统曰：“吾主汉朝皇叔，反不能占据州郡；其他皆汉之蟊贼，却都恃强侵占地土；惟智者不平焉。”玄德曰：“二公休言。吾有何德，敢多望乎？”松曰：“不然。明公乃汉室宗亲，仁义充塞乎四海。休道占据州郡，便代正统而居帝位，亦非分外。”玄德拱手谢曰：“公言太过，备何敢当！”\n\n
