It serves as an interrogation tool designed to extract information, often through the infliction of extreme pain, highlighting the Ixians' preference for mechanical solutions over organic manipulation. Additionally, the probe is referenced in the context of postmortem information extraction, suggesting its capability to retrieve data from deceased individuals. This is exemplified in its association with Duncan's experiences, where it may have been used to access memories or knowledge from the dead.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly—ranging from its general mechanical nature to its specific applications in interrogation and postmortem analysis—they collectively portray the IXIAN PROBE as a versatile and formidable Ixian technology. Its primary function revolves around information extraction, whether from living subjects under duress or from the dead, underscoring the Ixians' technological prowess and their contrast with the Tleilaxu's biologically oriented methods. The probe's association with Duncan further emphasizes its significance in high-stakes scenarios, though its exact mechanisms remain unspecified.  \n\nIn summary, the IXIAN PROBE is a mechanical interrogation and data-retrieval device of Ixian origin, capable of operating on both living and deceased subjects, and stands in opposition to the Tleilaxu's biological approaches. Its applications range from coercive extraction to postmortem analysis, reflecting the Ixians' advanced and often ruthless technological innovations.\",4\n1783,MILE TEG,\"Miles Teg is a military commander currently captured and being interrogated, showing resistance to mental probes\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4311,IXIAN PROBE,TEG,Teg is subjected to extreme pain by the Ixian Probe during interrogation,106\n4310,MILE TEG,IXIAN PROBE,\"Miles Teg resists interrogation via an Ixian Probe, demonstrating mental fortitude against technological extraction\",5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
