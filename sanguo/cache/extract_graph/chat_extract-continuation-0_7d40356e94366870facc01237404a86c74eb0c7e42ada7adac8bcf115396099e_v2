，回头不见了曹操，翻身复杀入城来，门下撞着李典。典韦问：“主公何在？”典曰：“吾亦寻不见。”韦曰：“汝在城外催救军，我入去寻主公。”李典去了。典韦杀入城中，寻觅不见；再杀出城壕边，撞着乐进。进曰：“主公何在？”韦曰：“我往复两遭：寻览不见。”进曰：“同杀入去救主！”两人到门边，城上火炮滚下，乐进马不能入。典韦冒烟突火，又杀入去，到处寻觅。\n\n    却说曹操见典韦杀出去了，四下里人马截来，不得出南门；再转北门，火光里正撞见吕布挺戟跃马而来。操以手掩面，加鞭纵马竟过。吕布从后拍马赶来，将戟于操盔上一击，问曰：“曹操何在？”操反指曰：“前面骑黄马者是他。”吕布听说，弃了曹操，纵马向前追赶。曹操拨转马头，望东门而走，正逢典韦。韦拥护曹操，杀条血路，到城门边，火焰甚盛，城上推下柴草，遍地都是火，韦用戟拨开，飞马冒烟突火先出。曹操随后亦出。方到门道边，城门上崩下一条火梁来，正打着曹操战马后胯，那马扑地倒了。操用手托梁推放地上，手臂须发，尽被烧伤。典韦回马来救，恰好夏侯渊亦到。两个同救起曹操，突火而出。操乘渊马，典韦杀条大路而走。直混战到天明，操方回寨。\n\n    众将拜伏问安，操仰面笑曰：“误中匹夫之计，吾必当报之！”郭嘉曰：“计可速发。”操曰：“今只将计就计：诈言我被火伤，已经身死。布必引兵来攻。我伏兵于马陵山中，候其兵半渡而击之，布可擒矣。”赢曰：“真良策也！”于是令军士挂孝发丧，诈言操死。早有人来濮阳报吕布，说曹操被火烧伤肢体，到寨身死。布随点起军马，杀奔马陵山来。将到操寨，一声鼓响，伏兵四起。吕布死战得脱，折了好些人马；败回濮阳，坚守不出。\n\n    是年蝗虫忽起，食尽禾稻。关东一境，每谷一斛，直钱五十贯，人民相食。曹操因军中粮尽，引兵回鄄城暂住。吕布亦引兵出屯山阳就食。因此二处权且罢兵。\n\n
