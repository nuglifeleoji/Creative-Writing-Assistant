He is revered by the people for his perceived healing abilities and is often regarded as a godly figure. This reverence stems from his spiritual practices and the belief in his powers to aid and heal those in need.\n\nHowever, the narrative surrounding 于吉 is complex and marked by tragedy. He was tasked with the significant responsibility of praying for rain, a critical endeavor given the agricultural dependence on rainfall. Despite his sincere efforts and dedication to this task, he ultimately faced execution due to his failure to bring rain. This outcome highlights the high stakes associated with his role and the expectations placed upon him by the community.\n\nThe duality of 于吉's character—both a revered healer and a tragic figure facing dire consequences—reflects the intricate relationship between spirituality, societal expectations, and the harsh realities of life in his time. His story serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by those who are seen as spiritual leaders, as well as the sometimes unforgiving nature of public perception and accountability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898655, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 411, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
