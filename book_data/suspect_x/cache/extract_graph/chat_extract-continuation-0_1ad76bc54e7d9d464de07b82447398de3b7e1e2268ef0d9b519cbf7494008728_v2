And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it.\nThe tooth!\nHe remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.\nSomeone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it.\nNot yet!\nThe someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn't remember.\n“How long will he remain drugged like this?” the Baron asked.\n“Perhaps another hour, m’Lord.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. “I am hungry.”\nThat’s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness and faded.\nTime became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. / must wait.\nThere was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.\n“I believe he’s coming around, Baron.”\nA silky voice, that one. That was Piter.\n“So | see, Piter.”\nA rumbling basso: the Baron.\nLeto sensed increasing definition in his Surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.\nAnd he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man’s hands: compulsive touchings—the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl.\nLeto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.\n“You can hear me, Duke Leto,” the Baron said. “l know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.”\nNo sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. /t’s true, then: they don’t have Paul and Jessica.\n“This is not a child’s game we play,” the Baron rumbled. “You must know that.” He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this could not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see royalty in such straits—it set a bad precedent.\nLeto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped capsule within that tooth—the poison gas—he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth.\nYueh.\nDrug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto’s mind. He knew it had been Yueh.\n“Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?” the Baron asked.\nLeto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone’s agony.\n“We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen,” the Baron said. “We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them. I’ve lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?”\nLeto felt fear tighten his chest. /f Yueh sent them to the desert fold...the search won't stop until they're found.\n“Come, come,” the Baron said. “We don’t have much time and pain is quick. Please don’t bring it to this, my dear Duke.” The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto’s shoulder. “Piter doesn’t have all his tools here, but I’m sure he could improvise.”\n“Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.”\nThat silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.\n“You had an emergency plan,” the Baron said. “Where have your woman and the boy been sent?” He looked at Leto’s hand. “Your ring is missing. Does the boy have it?”\nThe Baron looked up, stared into Leto’s eyes.\n“You don’t answer,” he said. “Will you force me to do a thing | do not want to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. | agree they’re sometimes the best, but it’s not good that you should be subjected to such things.”\n“Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids,” Piter said. “Perhaps on other portions of the body. It’s especially effective when the subject doesn’t know where the tallow will fall next. It’s a good method and there’s a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?”\n“Exquisite,” the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.\nThose touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands—their compulsive wandering.\nThe sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke’s nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?\n“Believe me, cher cousin,” the Baron said. “I do not want it to come to this.”\n“You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,” Piter said. “There’s an artistry in this, you know.”\n“You're a superb artist,” the Baron growled. “Now, have the decency to be silent.”\nLeto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had Said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: “‘And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea...and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.’”\n“We waste time, Baron,” Piter said.\n“Perhaps.”\nThe Baron nodded. “You know, my dear Leto, you'll tell us in the end where they are. There’s a level of pain that'll buy you.”\nHe’s most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth...and the fact that I truly don’t know where they are.\nThe Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.\n“Observe this prize person who denies he’s for hire,” the Baron said. “Observe him, Piter.”\nAnd the Baron thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he’d rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?\nThe frog sounds in the background stopped.\nThe Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across the room, shake his head. The captive hadn’t produced the needed information. Another failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft fool who didn’t realize how much hell there was so near him—only a nerve’s thickness away.\nThis thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a Surgeon exercising endless Supple scissor dissections—cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath.\nRabbits, all of them!\nAnd how they cowered when they saw the Carnivore!\nLeto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end it all quickly. Still—it had been good, much of this life. He found himself remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell- blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on Arrakis—colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.\n“Too bad,” the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood up lightly in his Suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke. He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.\nHow he fears me! the Baron thought.\nShocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear—the silky-voiced one: Piter.\nIt got him, too!\n“Piter! What’s wrong?”\nThe rumbling voice was far away.\nLeto sensed memories rolling in his mind—the old toothless mutterings of hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes—blue within blue, the eyes—all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.\nThere was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery —so distant—a roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every... silence.\nOne thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.\nSilence.\nThe Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had Slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?\nSounds returned to him...and reason. He heard someone shouting orders—gas masks...keep a door closed...get blowers going.\nThe others fell quickly, he thought. /’m still standing. I’m still breathing. Merciless hell! That was close!\nHe could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been pushing himself away from the table...that and Piter’s Shocked gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.\nChance and the warning in a dying man’s gasp— these had saved him.\nThe Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And that stupid guard captain! He’d said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Baron’s presence! How had it been possible for the Duke...? No warning. Not even from the poison Snooper over the table—until it was too late. How?\nWell, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.\nHe grew aware of more activity down the hall— around the corner at the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for the Baron’s reaction.\nWould the Baron be angry?\nAnd the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.\nSome of the guards had weapons leveled at the door.
