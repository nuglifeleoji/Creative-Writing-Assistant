Messengers should have better self-control, although some allowance had to be made for the seriousness of this message.\n“He then asked me to wait,” the messenger said. “He left the room and returned shortly with a Tleilaxu, a Face Dancer, I’m sure of it. There were the certain signs of the...”\n“I’m sure you're correct, girl,” Anteac said. “Now, get to the...” Anteac broke off as Luyseyal entered.\n“What’s this | hear about messages from the Ixians and Tleilaxu?” Luyseyal asked.\n“The girl’s repeating it now,” Anteac said.\n“Why wasn’t | summoned?” Anteac looked up at her fellow Truthsayer, thinking that Luyseyal might be one of the finest practitioners of the art but she remained too conscious of rank. Luyseyal was young, however, with the sensuous oval features of the Jessica-type, and those genes tended to carry a headstrong nature.\nAnteac spoke softly: “Your acolyte said you were meditating.”\nLuyseyal nodded, sat down on the pallet and spoke to the messenger. “Continue.”\n“The Face Dancer said he had a message for the Reverend Mothers. He used the plural,” the messenger said. “He knew there were two of us this time,” Anteac said.\n“Everyone knows it,” Luyseyal said.\nAnteac returned her full attention to the messenger. “Would you enter memory-trance now, girl, and give us the Face Dancer’s words verbatim.”\nThe messenger nodded, sat back onto her heels and clasped her hands in her lap. She took three deep breaths, closed her eyes and let her shoulders sag. When she spoke, her voice had a high-pitched, nasal twang.\n“Tell the Reverend Mothers that by tonight the Empire will be rid of its God Emperor. We will strike him today before he reaches Onn. We cannot fail.”\nA deep breath shook the messenger. Her eyes opened and she looked up at Anteac.\n“The Ixian, Yake, told me to hurry back with this message. He then touched the back of my left hand in that particular way, further convincing me that he was not...”\n“Yake is one of ours,” Anteac said. “Tell Luyseyal the message of the fingers.”\nThe messenger looked at Luyseyal. “We have been invaded by Face Dancers and cannot move.”\nAs Luyseyal started and began to rise from the pallet, Anteac said: “I already have taken the appropriate steps to guard our doors.” Anteac looked at the messenger. “You may go now, girl. You have been adequate to your task.”\n“Yes, Reverend Mother.” The messenger lifted her lithe body with a certain amount of grace, but there was no doubt in her movements that she knew the import of Anteac’s words. Adequate was not well done.\nWhen the messenger had gone, Luyseyal said: “She should’ve made some excuse to study the Embassy and find out how many of the Ixians have been replaced.”\n“I think not,” Anteac said. “In that respect, she performed well. No, but it would have been better had she found a way to get a more detailed report from Yake. | fear we have lost him.”\n“The reason the Tleilaxu sent us that message is obvious, of course,” Luyseyal said.\n“They are really going to attack him,” Anteac said.\n“Naturally. It’s what the foo/s would do. But | address myself to why they sent the message to us.”\nAnteac nodded. “They think we now have no choice except to join them.”\n“And if we try to warn the Lord Leto, the Tleilaxu will learn our messengers and their contacts.”\n“What if the Tleilaxu succeed?” Anteac asked.\n“Not likely.” “We do not know their actual plan, only its general timing.”\n“What if this girl, this Siona, has a part in it?” Luyseyal asked.\n“| have asked myself that same question. Have you heard the full report from the Guild?”\n“Only the summary. Is that enough?”\n“Yes, with high probability.”\n“You should be careful with terms such as high probability,” Luyseyal said. “We don’t want anyone thinking you're a Mentat.”\nAnteac’s tone was dry. “I presume you will not give me away.”\n“Do you think the Guild is right about this Siona?” Luyseyal asked.\n“I do not have enough information. If they are right, she is something extraordinary.”\n“As the Lord Leto’s father was extraordinary?”\n“A Guild navigator could conceal himself from the oracular eye of the Lord Leto’s father.”\n“But not from the Lord Leto.”\n“| have read the full Guild report with care. She does not so much conceal herself and the actions around her as, well...”\n“She fades,” Luyseyal said. “She fades from their sight.”\n“She alone,” Anteac said.\n“And from the sight of the Lord Leto as well?”\n“They do not know.”\n“Do we dare make contact with her?”\n“Do we dare not?” Anteac asked.\n“This all may be moot if the Tleilaxu ... Anteac, we should at least make the attempt to warn him.”\n“We have no communications devices and there now are Fish Speaker guards at the door. They permit our people to enter, but not to leave.”\n“Should we speak to one of them?”\n“| have thought about that. We can always say we feared they were Face Dancer substitutes.”\n“Guards at the door,” Luyseyal muttered. “Is it possible that he knows?”\n“Anything is possible.”\n“With the Lord Leto that’s the only thing you can say for Sure,” Luyseyal said.\nAnteac permitted herself a small sigh as she lifted herself from the stool. “How | long for the old days when we had all of the spice we could ever need.”\n“Ever was just another illusion,” Luyseyal said. “I hope we have learned our lesson well, no matter how the Tleilaxu make out today.”\n“They will do it clumsily whatever the outcome,” Anteac grumbled. “Gods! There are no good assassins to be found anymore.”\n“There are always the ghola Idahos,” Luyseyal said.\n“What did you say?” Anteac stared at her companion.\n“There are always...”\n“Yes!”\n“The gholas are too slow in the body,” Luyseyal said.\n“But not in the head.”\n“What're you thinking?”\n“Is it possible that the Tleilaxu ... No, not even they could be that...”\n“An Idaho Face Dancer?” Luyseyal whispered.\nAnteac nodded mutely.\n“Put it out of your mind,” Luyseyal said. “They could not be that stupid.”\n“That’s a dangerous judgment to make about Tleilaxu,” Anteac said. “We must prepare ourselves for the worst. Get one of those Fish Speaker guards in here!”\nUnceasing warfare gives rise to its own social conditions which have been similar in all epochs. People enter a permanent state of alertness to ward off attacks. You see the absolute rule of the autocrat. All new things become dangerous frontier districts—new planets, new economic areas to exploit, new ideas or new devices, visitors—everything suspect. Feudalism takes firm hold, sometimes disguised as a politbureau or similar structure, but always present. Hereditary succession follows the lines of power. The blood of the powerful dominates. The vice regents of heaven or their equivalent apportion the wealth. And they know they must control inheritance or slowly let the power melt away. Now, do you understand Leto’s Peace?\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndd H ave the Bene Gesserit been informed of the new schedule?” Leto asked.\nHis entourage had entered the first shallow cut which would wind into switchbacks at the approach to the bridge across the Idaho River. The sun stood at the morning’s first quarter and a few courtiers were shedding cloaks. Idaho walked with a small troop of Fish Speakers at the left flank, his uniform beginning to show traces of dust and perspiration. Walking and trotting at the speed of a Royal peregrination was hard work.\nMoneo stumbled and caught himself. “They have been informed, Lord.” The change of schedule had not been easy, but Moneo had learned to expect erratic shifts of direction at Festival time. He kept contingency plans at the ready.\n“Are they still petitioning for a permanent Embassy on Arrakis?” Leto asked.\n“Yes, Lord. | gave them the usual answer.”\n“A simple ‘no’ should suffice,” Leto said. “They no longer need to be reminded that | abhor their religious pretensions.”\n“Yes, Lord.” Moneo held himself to just within the prescribed distance beside Leto’s cart. The Worm was very much present this morning—the bodily signs quite apparent to Moneo’s eyes. No doubt it was the moisture in the air. That always seemed to bring out the Worm.\n“Religion always leads to rhetorical despotism,” Leto said. “Before the Bene Gesserit, the Jesuits were the best at it.”\n“Jesuits, Lord?”\n“Surely you’ve met them in your histories?”\n“I’m not certain, Lord. When were they?”\n“No matter. You learn enough about rhetorical despotism from a study of the Bene Gesserit. Of course, they do not begin by deluding themselves with it.”\nThe Reverend Mothers are in for a bad time, Moneo told himself. He’s going to preach at them. They detest that. This could cause serious trouble.\n“What was their reaction?” Leto asked.\n“I’m told they were disappointed but did not press the matter.”\nAnd Moneo thought: /’d best prepare them for more disappointment. And they'll have to be kept away from the delegations of Ix and Tleilaxu.\nMoneo shook his head. This could lead to some very nasty plotting. The Duncan had better be warned.\n“It leads to self-fulfilling prophecy and justifications for all manner of obscenities,” Leto said.\n“This... rhetorical despotism, Lord?”\n“Yes! It shields evil behind walls of self-righteousness which are proof against all arguments against the evil.”\nMoneo kept a wary eye on Leto’s body, noting the way the hands twisted, almost a random movement, the twitching of the great ribbed segments. What will I do if the Worm comes out of him here? Perspiration broke out on Moneo’s forehead.\n“It feeds on deliberately twisted meanings to discredit opposition,” Leto said.\n“All of that, Lord?”\n“The Jesuits called that ‘securing your power base.’ It leads directly to hypocrisy which is always betrayed by the gap between actions and explanations. They never agree.”\n“I must study this more carefully, Lord.”\n“Ultimately, it rules by guilt because hypocrisy brings on the witch hunt and the demand for scapegoats.”\n“Shocking, Lord.”\nThe cortege rounded a corner where the rock had been opened for a glimpse of the bridge in the distance.\n“Moneo, are you paying close attention to me?”\n“Yes, Lord. Indeed.”\n“I’m describing a tool of the religious power base.”\n“| recognize that, Lord.”\n“Then why are you so afraid?”\n“Talk of religious power always makes me uneasy, Lord.”\n“Because you and the Fish Speakers wield it in my name?”\n“Of course,", " broke out on Moneo’s forehead.\n“It feeds on deliberately twisted meanings to discredit opposition,” Leto said.\n“All of that, Lord?”\n“The Jesuits called that ‘securing your power base.’ It leads directly to hypocrisy which is always betrayed by the gap between actions and explanations. They never agree.”\n“I must study this more carefully, Lord.”\n“Ultimately, it rules by guilt because hypocrisy brings on the witch hunt and the demand for scapegoats.”\n“Shocking, Lord.”\nThe cortege rounded a corner where the rock had been opened for a glimpse of the bridge in the distance.\n“Moneo, are you paying close attention to me?”\n“Yes, Lord. Indeed.”\n“I’m describing a tool of the religious power base.”\n“| recognize that, Lord.”\n“Then why are you so afraid?”\n“Talk of religious power always makes me uneasy, Lord.”\n“Because you and the Fish Speakers wield it in my name?”\n“Of course, Lord.”\n“Power bases are very dangerous because they attract people who are truly insane, people who seek power only for the sake of power. Do you understand?”\n“Yes, Lord. That is why you so seldom grant petitions for appointments in your government.”\n“Excellent, Moneo!”\n“Thank you, Lord.”\n“In the shadow of every religion lurks a Torquemada,” Leto said. “You have never encountered that name. | know because | caused it to be expunged from all the records.”\n“Why was that, Lord?”\n“He was an obscenity. He made living torches out of people who disagreed with him.”\nMoneo pitched his voice low. “Like the historians who angered you, Lord?”\n“Do you question my actions, Moneo?”\n“No, Lord!”\n“Good. The historians died peacefully. Not a one felt the flames. Torquemada, however, delighted in commending to his god the agonized screams of his burning victims.”\n“How horrible, Lord.”\nThe cortege turned another corner with a view of the bridge. The span appeared to be no closer.\nOnce more, Moneo studied his God Emperor. The Worm appeared no closer. Still too close, though. Moneo could feel the menace of that unpredictable presence, the Holy Presence which could kill without warning.\nMoneo shuddered.\nWhat had been the meaning of that strange .. . sermon? Moneo knew that few had ever heard the God Emperor speak thus. It was a privilege and a burden. It was part of the price paid for Leto’s Peace. Generation after generation marched in their ordered way under the dictates of that peace. Only the Citadel’s inner circle knew all of the infrequent breaks in that peace—the incidents when Fish Speakers were sent out in anticipation of violence.\nAnticipation!\nMoneo glanced at the now-silent Leto. The God Emperor’s eyes were closed and a look of brooding had come over his face. That was another of the Worm signs—a bad one. Moneo trembled.\nDid Leto anticipate even his own moments of wild violence? It was the anticipation of violence which sent tremors of awe and fear throughout the Empire. Leto knew where guards must be posted to put down a transitory uprising. He knew it before the event.\nEven thinking about such matters dried Moneo’s mouth. There were times, Moneo believed, when the God Emperor could read any mind. Oh, Leto employed spies. An occasional shrouded figure passed by the Fish Speakers for the climb to Leto’s tower aerie or descended to the crypt. Spies, no doubt of it, but Moneo suspected they were used merely to confirm what Leto already knew.\nAs though to confirm the fears in Moneo’s mind, Leto said: “Do not try to force an understanding of my ways, Moneo. Let understanding come of itself.”\n“I will try, Lord.”\n“No, do not try. Tell me, instead, if you have announced yet that there will be no changes in the spice allotments?”\n“Not yet, Lord.”\n“Delay the announcement. | am changing my mind. You know, of course, that there will be new offers of bribes.”\nMoneo sighed. The amounts offered him in bribes had reached ridiculous heights. Leto, however, had appeared amused by the escalation.\n“Draw them out,” he had said earlier. “See how high they will go. Make it appear that you can be bribed at last.”\nNow, as they turned another corner with a view of the bridge, Leto asked: “Has House Corrino offered you a bribe?”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“Do you know the myth which says that someday House Corrino will be restored to its ancient powers?”\n“I have heard it, Lord.”\n“Have the Corrino killed. It is a task for the Duncan. We will test him.”\n“So soon, Lord?”\n“It is still Known that melange can extend human life. Let it also be known that the spice can shorten life.”\n“AS you command, Lord.”\nMoneo knew this response in himself. It was the way he spoke when he could not voice a deep objection which he felt. He also knew that the Lord Leto understood this and was amused by it. The amusement rankled.\n“Try not to be impatient with me, Moneo,” Leto said. Moneo suppressed his feeling of bitterness. Bitterness brought peril. Rebels were bitter. The Duncans grew bitter\nbefore they died.\n“Time has a different meaning for you than it has for me, Lord,” Moneo said. “I wish | could know that meaning.”\n“You could but you will not.”\nMoneo heard rebuke in the words and fell silent, turning his thoughts instead to the melange problems. It was not often that the Lord Leto spoke of the spice, and then it usually was to set allotments or withdraw them, to apportion rewards or send the Fish Speakers after some newly revealed hoard. The greatest remaining store of spice, Moneo knew, lay in some place known only to the God Emperor. In his first days of Royal Service, Moneo had been covered in a hood and led by the Lord Leto himself to that secret place along twisting passages which Moneo had sensed were underground.\nWhen I removed the hood, we were underground.\nThe place had filled Moneo with awe. Great bins of melange lay all around in a gigantic room cut from native rock and illuminated by glowglobes of an ancient design with arabesques of metal scrollwork upon them. The spice had glowed radiant blue in the dim silver light. And the smell—bitter cinnamon, unmistakable. There had been water dripping nearby. Their voices had echoed against the stone.\n“One day all of this will be gone,” the Lord Leto had said.\nShocked, Moneo had asked: “What will the Guild and Bene Gesserit do then?”\n“What they are doing now, but more violently.”\nStaring around the gigantic room with its enormous store of melange, Moneo could only think of things he knew were happening in the Empire at that moment—bloody assassinations, piratical raids, spying and intrigue. The God Emperor kept a lid on the worst of it, but what remained was bad enough.\n“The temptation,” Moneo whispered.\n“The temptation, indeed.”\n“Will there be no more melange, ever, Lord?”\n“Someday, | will go back into the sand. | will be the source of spice then.”\n“You, Lord?”\n“And | will produce something just as wonderful—more sandtrout—a hybrid and a prolific breeder.”\nTrembling at this revelation, Moneo stared at the shadowy figure of the God Emperor who spoke of such marvels.\n“The sandtrout,” Lord Leto said, “will link themselves into large living bubbles to enclose this planet’s water deep underground. Just as it was in the Dune times.”\n“All of the water, Lord?”\n“Most of it. Within three hundred years, the sandworm once more will reign here. It will be a new kind of sandworm, | promise you.”\n“How is that, Lord?”\n“It will have animal awareness and a new cunning. The spice will be more dangerous to seek and far more perilous to keep.”\nMoneo had looked up at the cavern’s rocky ceiling, his imagination probing through the rock to the surface.\n“Everything desert again, Lord?”\n“Watercourses will fill with sand. Crops will be choked and killed. Trees will be covered by great moving dunes. The sand-death will spread until... until a subtle signal is heard in the barren lands.”\n“What signal, Lord?”\n“The signal for the next cycle, the coming of the Maker, the coming of Shai-Hulud.”\n“Will that be you, Lord?”\n“Yes! The great sandworm of Dune will rise once more from the deeps. This land will be again the domain of spice and worm.”\n“But what of the people, Lord? All of the people?”\n“Many will die. Food plants and the abundant growth of this land will be parched. Without nourishment, meat animals will die.”\n“Will everyone go hungry, Lord?”\n“Undernourishment and the old diseases will stalk the land, while only the hardiest survive... the hardiest and most brutal.”\n“Must that be, Lord?”\n“The alternatives are worse.”\n“Teach me about those alternatives, Lord.”\n“In time, you will know them.”\nAs he marched beside the God Emperor in the morning light of their peregrination to Onn, Moneo could only admit that he had, indeed, learned of alternative evils.\nTo most of the Empire’s docile citizens, Moneo knew, the firm knowledge which he held in his own head lay concealed in the Oral History, in the myths and wild stories told by infrequent mad prophets who cropped up on one planet or another to gather a short-lived following.\nBut I know what the Fish Speakers do.\nAnd he knew also about evil men who sat at table, gorging themselves on rare delicacies while they watched the torture of fellow humans.\nUntil the Fish Speakers came, and gore erased such scenes.\n“| enjoyed the way your daughter watched me,” Leto said. “She was so unaware that | knew.”\n“Lord, | fear for her! She is my blood, my...”\n“Mine, too, Moneo. Am | not Atreides? You would be better employed fearing for yourself.”\nMoneo cast a fearful glance along the God Emperor’s body. The signs of the Worm remained too near. Moneo glanced at the cortege following, then along the road ahead. They now were into the steep descent, the switchbacks short and cut into high walls in the man-piled rocks of the cliff barrier which girdled the Sareer.\n“Siona does not offend me, Moneo.”\n“But she...”\n“Moneo! Here, in its mysterious capsule is one of life’s great secrets. To be surprised, to have a new thing occur, that is what | desire most.”\n“Lord, |...”\n“New! Isn’t that a radiant, a wonderful word?”\n“If you say it, Lord.”\nLeto was forced to remind himself then: Moneo is my creature. | created him.\n“Your child is worth almost any price to me, Moneo. You decry her companions, but there may be one among them that she will love.”\nMoneo cast an involuntary glance back at Duncan Idaho marching with the guards. Idaho was glaring ahead as though trying to probe each turn in the road before they reached it. He did not like this place with its high walls all around from which attack might come. Idaho had sent scouts up there in the night and Moneo knew that some of them still lurked on the heights, but there also were", "”\n“Moneo!

Idaho had sent scouts up there in the night and Moneo knew that some of them still lurked on the heights, but there also were ravines ahead before the marchers reached the river. And there had not been enough guards to station them everywhere.\n“We will depend upon the Fremen,” Moneo had reassured him.\n“Fremen?” Idaho did not like what he heard about the Museum Fremen.\n“At least they can sound an alarm against intruders,” Moneo had said.\n“You saw them and asked them to do that?”\n“Of course.”\nMoneo had not dared to broach the subject of Siona to Idaho. Time enough for that later, but now the God Emperor had said a disturbing thing. Had there been a change in plans?\nMoneo returned his attention to the God Emperor and lowered his voice.\n“Love a companion, Lord? But you said the Duncan...”\n“I said love, not breed with!”\nMoneo trembled, thinking of how his own mating had been arranged, the wrenching away from...\nNo! Best not follow those memories!\nThere had been affection, even a real love... later, but in the first days...\n“You are woolgathering again, Moneo.”\n“Forgive me, Lord, but when you speak of love...”\n“You think | have no tender thoughts?”\n“It’s not that, Lord, but...”\n“You think | have no memories of love and breeding, then?” The cart swerved toward Moneo, forcing him to dodge away, frightened by the glowering look on the Lord Leto’s face.\n“Lord, | beg your...”\n“This body may never have known such tenderness, but all of the memories are mine!”\nMoneo could see the signs of the Worm growing more dominant in the God Emperor’s body and there was no escaping recognition of this mood.\nlam in grave danger. We all are.\nMoneo grew aware of every sound around him, the creaking of the Royal Cart, the coughs and low conversation from the entourage, the feet on the roadway. There was an exhalation of cinnamon from the God Emperor. The air here between the enclosing rock walls still held its morning chill and there was dampness from the river.\nWas it the moisture bringing out the Worm?\n“Listen to me, Moneo, as though your life depended on it.”\n“Yes, Lord,” Moneo whispered, and he knew his life did depend on the care he took now, not only in listening but in observing.\n“Part of me dwells forever underground without thought,” Leto said. “That part reacts. It does things without a care for knowing or logic.”\nMoneo nodded, his attention glued on the God Emperor’s face. Were the eyes about to glaze?\n“lam forced to stand off and watch such things, nothing more,” Leto said. “Such a reaction could cause your death. The choice is not mine. Do you hear?”\n“| hear you, Lord,” Moneo whispered.\n“There is no such thing as choice in such an event! You accept it, merely accept it. You will never understand it or know it. What do you say to that?”\n“I fear the unknown, Lord.”\n“But | don’t fear it. Tell me why!”\nMoneo had been expecting a crisis such as this and, now that it had come, he almost welcomed it. He knew that his life depended on his answer. He stared at his God Emperor, mind racing.\n“It is because of all your memories, Lord.”\n“Yes?”\nAn incomplete answer, then. Moneo grasped at words. “You see everything that we know ... all of it as it once was —unknown! A surprise to you. . . a surprise must be merely something new for you to know?” As he spoke, Moneo realized he had put a defensive question mark on something that should have been a bold statement, but the God Emperor only smiled.\n“For such wisdom | grant you a boon, Moneo. What is your wish?”\nSudden relief only opened a path for other fears to emerge. “Could | bring Siona back to the Citadel?”\n“That will cause me to test her sooner.”\n“She must be separated from her companions, Lord.”\n“Very well.”\n“My Lord is gracious.”\n“lam selfish.”\nThe God Emperor turned away from Moneo then and fell Silent.\nLooking along the segmented body, Moneo observed that the Worm signs had subsided somewhat. This had turned out well after all. He thought then of the Fremen with their petition and fear returned.\nThat was a mistake. They will only arouse Him again. Why did | say they could present their petition?\nThe Fremen would be waiting up ahead, marshalled on this side of the river with their foolish papers waving in their hands.\nMoneo marched in silence, his apprehension increasing with each step.\nOver here sand blows; over there sand blows. Over there a rich man waits; over here | wait.\n—THE VOICE OF SHAI-HULUD, FROM THE ORAL HISTORY\nSister Chenoeh’s account, found among her papers after her death:\n| obey both my tenets as a Bene Gesserit and the commands of the God Emperor by withholding these words from my report while secreting them that they may be found when | am gone. For the Lord Leto said to me: “You will return to your Superiors with my message, but these words keep secret for now. | will visit my rage upon your Sisterhood if you fail.”\nAs the Reverend Mother Syaksa warned me before | left: “You must do nothing which will bring down his wrath upon us.”\nWhile | ran beside the Lord Leto on that short peregrination of which | had spoken, | thought to ask him about his likeness to a Reverend Mother. | said:\n“Lord, | Know how it is that a Reverend Mother acquires the memories of her ancestors and of others. How was it with you?”\n“It was a design of our genetic history and the working of the spice. My twin sister, Ghanima, and | were awakened in the womb, aroused before birth into the presence of our ancestral memories.”\n“Lord... my Sisterhood calls that Abomination.”\n“And rightly so,” the Lord Leto said. “The ancestral numbers can be overwhelming. And who knows before the event which force will command such a horde—good or evil?”\n“Lord, how did you overcome such a force?”\n“I did not overcome it,” the Lord Leto said. “But the persistence of the pharaonic model saved both Ghani and me. Do you know that model, Sister Chenoeh?”\n“We of the Sisterhood are well coached in history, Lord.”\n“Yes, but you do not think of this as | do,” the Lord Leto said. “I speak of a disease of government which was caught by the Greeks who spread it to the Romans who distributed it so far and wide that it never has completely died out.”\n“Does my Lord speak riddles?”\n“No riddles. | hate this thing, but it saved us. Ghani and | formed powerful internal alliances with ancestors who followed the pharaonic model. They helped us form a mingled identity within that long-dormant mob.”\n“I find this disturbing, Lord.”\n“And well you should.”\n“Why are you telling me this now, Lord? You have never answered one of us before in this manner, not that | know of.”\n“Because you listen well, Sister Chenoeh; because you will obey me and because | will never see you again.”\nThe Lord Leto spoke those strange words to me and then he asked:\n“Why have you not inquired about what your Sisterhood calls my insane tyranny?”\nEmboldened by his manner, | ventured to say: “Lord, we know about some of your bloody executions. They trouble us.”\nThe Lord Leto then did a strange thing. He closed his eyes as we went, and he said:\n“Because | know you have been trained to record accurately whatever words you hear, | will soeak to you now, Sister Chenoeh, as though you were a page in one of my journals. Preserve these words well, for | do not want them lost.”\n| assure my Sisterhood now that what follows, exactly as he spoke them, are the words uttered then by the Lord Leto:\n“To my certain knowledge, when | am no longer consciously present here among you, when | am here only as a fearsome creature of the desert, many people will look back upon me as a tyrant.\n“Fair enough. | have been tyrannical.\n“A tyrant—not fully human, not insane, merely a tyrant. But even ordinary tyrants have motives and feelings beyond those usually assigned them by facile historians, and they will think of me as a great tyrant. Thus, my feelings and motives are a legacy | would preserve lest history distort them too much. History has a way of magnifying some characteristics while it discards others.\n“People will try to understand me and to frame me in their words. They will seek truth. But the truth always carries the ambiguity of the words used to express it.\n“You will not understand me. The harder you try the more remote | will become until finally | vanish into eternal myth —a Living God at last!\n“That’s it, you see. |am not a leader nor even a guide. A god. Remember that. | am quite different from leaders and guides. Gods need take no responsibility for anything except genesis. Gods accept everything and thus accept nothing. Gods must be identifiable yet remain anonymous. Gods do not need a spirit world. My spirits dwell within me, answerable to my slightest summons. I share with you, because it pleases me to do so, what | have learned about them and through them. They are my truth.\n“Beware of the truth, gentle Sister. Although much sought after, truth can be dangerous to the seeker. Myths and reassuring lies are much easier to find and believe. If you find a truth, even a temporary one, it can demand that you make painful changes. Conceal your truths within words. Natural ambiguity will protect you then. Words are much easier to absorb than are the sharp Delphic stabs of wordless portent. With words, you can cry out in the chorus:\n“Why didn’t someone warn me?’\n““But | did warn you. | warned you by example, not with words.’\n“There are inevitably more than enough words. You record them in your marvelous memory even now. And someday,\nmy journals will be discovered—more words. | warn you that you read my words at your peril. The wordless movement of terrible events lies just below their surface. Be deaf! You do not need to hear or, hearing, you do not need to remember. How soothing it is to forget. And how dangerous!\n“Words such as mine have long been recognized for their mysterious power. There is a secret knowledge here which can be used to rule the forgetful.
