“谈不上什么兴趣，只是有点好奇罢了。我倒不讨厌这种所谓铜墙铁壁的不在场证明。”\n   “与其说是铜墙铁壁，应该说是难以查证，所以我才伤脑筋。”\n    “那个嫌疑犯，照你们的说法不是清白的吗？”\n    “或许是吧，问题是目前还没有其他的可疑人物浮出台面。况且，案发那晚正巧去看电影唱KTV，你不觉得未免太刚好了吗？”\n

“我想起来了，你说衣服没有烧光吧？深蓝色运动外套和灰毛衣，以及深色长裤啊……听起来好像是随处可见的打扮。”\n    “就是啊。自认好像见过那个人的说法多到数不清，负责打听的人都举手投降了。”\n    “这么说来，目前还没有什么又用的情报喽？”\n    “是啊。只有一个情报，目击者说曾在车站旁边看过同样打扮的可疑男子，有个粉领族看到他无所事事到处闲逛。因为车站也张贴了这张肖像图，所以她看了主动来通报。”\n    “原来还真有人这么配合啊，那你何不找那个粉领族详细打听？”\n    “用不着你说，我当然问了。可惜她看到的好像并不是遇害者。”\n    “你怎么知道？”\n    “她说的车站并非条崎，而是前一站的瑞江站。而且，长相似乎也不同。我一拿遇害者的照片给她看，她就说她记得脸应该更圆才对。”\n    “恩……圆脸啊……”\n    “唉，干我们这行本来就得不断重复这种挥拳落空的滋味。跟你们这种只要道理讲得通，就能获得肯定的世界可是大不相同。”草S一边用筷子捞起煮烂的马铃薯一边说，然而汤川毫无反应。草S抬头一看，只见他双手轻握，瞪着空中。\n
