轮值主席。\n　　主席敲了一下木槌，制止了会场上出现的喧声：“面壁者罗辑，有一个问题：既然是咒语，为什么不直接针对敌人的世界？”\n　　罗辑说：“这是一次实验，用来证实我自己的战略设想，战略真正的实施要在末日之战到来时。”\n　　“三体世界难道不能作为实验咒语的目标吗？”\n　　罗辑断然摇摇头，“绝对不行，太近了，距我们太近了，咒语发生作用时很可能波及到我们，我为此甚至放弃了五十光年以内的带有行星的恒星。”\n　　“最后一个问题：在这一百年或更长的时间里，您打算做什么？”\n　　“你们可以摆脱我了：冬眠，当观测到咒语在187J3X1 星系上发生作用时叫醒我。”\n　　在准备进入冬眠的期间，罗辑患上了轻流感。最初的症状与别人一样，只是流鼻涕和嗓子轻微发炎，他自己和别人都没在意。但两天后，罗辑的病情加重了，开始发烧，医生感觉有些异常，就取了血样回市里分析。\n　　这天夜里，罗辑在高烧中昏睡，一直被狂躁的梦境所缠绕。梦中，夜空中的群星在纷乱地舞动着，像振动着的鼓皮上的沙粒，他甚至意识到了这些星球问的引力联系，它们做的不是三体运动，而是银河系中所有恒星的2000
