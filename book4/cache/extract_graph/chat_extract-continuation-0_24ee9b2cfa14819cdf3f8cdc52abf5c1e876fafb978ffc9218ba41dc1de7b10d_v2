\n　　乔伯年索性接上秘书的话，进一步“发挥”说：“那样，大家以为失了火，说不定把救火车也开来了！” \n　　乔伯年一边开玩笑，一边吞下去八片羚羊感冒片和一包阿鲁散。 \n　　第二天早晨，病情果真好了许多，他就立刻起程直奔黄原…… \n　　省委书记一到，地委书记就忙了。田福军先和乔书记在几个偏远县份的农村跑了一大圈；回到黄原后，紧接着就召开县委书记以上的领导干部会议，以听取省委书记对地区工作的指示。 \n　　在这个干部会上，乔伯年热忱地肯定和赞扬了黄原地区的工作；同时指出了下一步应该解决的主要问题。这实际上也是省委对田福军本人工作的肯定。乔书记的讲话使田福军眼圈不由地发热。他感谢省委在他困难的时候，及时支持了他…… \n　　省委肯定了田福军的工作，也不等于就否定了反对田福军的高凤阁同志。以后不多日子，在省委常务副书记吴斌同志的坚持下，高凤阁被调到南面一个地区如愿以偿地任了行署专员。领导这么一个大省，省委书记不可能在一切事上明察秋毫；再说，即使看出类似的问题，有时也不得不作某些妥协——这是政治生活中常有的现象……送走省委书记以后，黄原地区各县的县委书记都回去了。但田福军把原西县委书记张有智留了下来。他要单独和他商谈一件事。当然，他实际上也有许多话想对这位老朋友说。平心而论，原西县这两年的工作是不能令人满意的；这责任在很大程度上和有智分不开——他是一把手嘛！福军自己感到，他一个很大的弱点就是在老朋友面前破不开脸皮。本来，他早应该直截了当指出有智同志这两年在工作中所存在的问题，但他却一直没有这样做。 \n　　这一天晚饭前，他把张有智从黄原宾馆带回到自己家里。爱云没去医院上班，忙了整整一个下午，已经备办好了一桌饭菜。饭桌上，因为老丈人徐国强和妻子都在座，福军先没和有智谈工作方面的事。四个人一边喝酒吃饭，说起许多过去的话题。有智是个爽快人，不仅和爱云开玩笑，还和他过去的老上级徐国强老汉也逗趣。 \n　　吃完饭后，田福军和张有智进了会客室。爱云给他们沏好茶，就退出去了——作为地委书记的老婆，她知道丈夫要和有智谈些她不应该再听的话了。 \n　　“有件事我想和你商谈一下。”田福军给张有智递上一根纸烟。 \n　　张有智没说话，点着烟听福军的下文。 \n　　“\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
