place,” Duncan said, “Perhaps I'll sing you a song. Not as good as old Gurney Halleck would do it but good enough to prepare for a little bedsport.”\n“You find this amusing?” she asked.\n“Amusing? No, but | am reminded of Gurney. Tell me, Bashar, have you brought him back from the dead, too?”\n“Not to my knowledge,” Teg said.\n“Ahhhh, there was a singing man!” Duncan said. “He could be killing you while he sang and never miss a note.”\nHer manner still icy, Lucilla said: “We of the Bene Gesserit have learned to avoid music. It evokes too many confusing emotions. Memory-emotions, of course.”\nIt was meant to awe him with a reminder of all those Other Memories and the Bene Gesserit powers these implied but Duncan only laughed louder.\n“What a shame that is,” he said. “You miss so much of life.” And he began humming an old Halleck refrain:\n“Review friends, troops long past review...”\nBut his mind whirled elsewhere with the rich new flavor of these reborn moments and once more he felt the eager touch of something powerful that remained buried within him. Whatever it was, it was violent and it concerned Lucilla, the Imprinter. In imagination, he saw her dead and her body awash in blood.\nPeople always want something more than immediate joy or that deeper sense called happiness. This is one of the secrets by which we shape the fulfillment of our designs. The something more assumes amplified power with people who cannot give it a name or who (most often the case) do not even suspect its existence. Most people only react unconsciously to such hidden forces. Thus, we have only to call a calculated something more into existence, define it and give it shape, then people will follow.\n—LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF THE BENE GESSERIT\nW ith a silent Waff about twenty paces ahead of them, Odrade and Sheeana walked down a weed-fringed road beside a spice-storage yard. All of them wore new desert robes and glistening stillsuits. The gray nulplaz fence that defined the yard beside them held bits of grass and cottony seedpods in its meshes. Looking at the seedpods, Odrade thought of them as life trying to break through a human intervention.\nBehind them, the blocky buildings that had arisen around Dar-es-Balat baked in the sunlight of early afternoon. Hot dry air burned her throat when she inhaled too quickly. Odrade felt dizzy and at war within herself. Thirst nagged at her. She walked as though balanced on the edge of a precipice. The situation she had created at Taraza’s command might explode momentarily.\nHow fragile it is!\nThree forces balanced, not really supporting each other but joined by motives that could shift in an instant and topple the whole alliance. The military people sent by Taraza did not reassure Odrade. Where was Teg? Where was Burzmali? For that matter, where was the ghola? He should be here by now. Why had she been ordered to delay matters?\nToday’s venture would certainly delay matters! Although it had Taraza’s blessing, Odrade thought this excursion into the desert of the worms might be a permanent delay. And there was Waff. If he survived, would there be any pieces for him to pick up?\nDespite the healing applications of the Sisterhood’s best quicknit amplifiers, Waff said his arms still ached where Odrade had broken them. He was not complaining, merely providing information. He appeared to accept their fragile alliance, even the modifications that incorporated the Rakian priestly cabal. No doubt he was reassured that one of his own Face Dancers occupied the High Priest’s bench in the guise of Tuek. Waff spoke forcefully when he demanded his “breeding mothers” from the Bene Gesserit and, consequently, withheld his part of their bargain.\n“Only a small delay while the Sisterhood reviews the new agreement,” Odrade explained. “Meanwhile. . .”\nToday was “meanwhile.”\nOdrade put aside her misgivings and began to enter the mood of this venture. Waff’s behavior fascinated her, especially his reaction on meeting Sheeana: quite plainly fearful and more than a little in awe.\nThe minion of his Prophet.\nOdrade glanced sideways at the girl walking dutifully beside her. There was the real leverage for shaping these events into the Bene Gesserit design.\nThe Sisterhood’s breakthrough into the reality behind Tleilaxu behavior excited Odrade. Waff’s fanatic “true faith” gained shape with each new response from him. She felt fortunate just to be here studying a Tleilaxu Master in a religious setting. The very grit under Waff’s feet ignited behavior that she had been trained to identify.\nWe should have guessed, Odrade thought. The manipulations of our own Missionaria Protectiva should have told us how the Tleilaxu did it: keeping themselves to\nthemselves, blocking off every intrusion for all of those plodding millennia.\nThey did not appear to have copied the Bene Gesserit structure. And what other force could do such a thing? It was a religion. The Great Belief!\nUnless the Tleilaxu are using their ghola system as a kind of immortality.\nTaraza could be right. Reincarnated Tleilaxu Masters would not be like Reverend Mothers—no Other Memories, only personal memories. But prolonged!\nFascinating!\nOdrade looked ahead at Waff’s back. Plodding. It appeared to come naturally to him. She recalled that he called Sheeana “Alyama.” Another confirming linguistic insight into Waff’s Great Belief. It meant “Blessed One.” The Tleilaxu had kept an ancient language not only alive but unchanged.\nDid Waff not know that only powerful forces such as religions did that?\nWe have the roots of your obsession in our grasp, Waff! It is not unlike some that we have created. We know how to manipulate such things for our own purposes.\nTaraza’s communication burned in Odrade’s awareness: “The Tleilaxu plan is transparent: Ascendancy. The human universe must be made into a Tleilaxu universe. They could not hope to achieve such a goal without help from the Scattering. Ergo.”\nThe Mother Superior’s reasoning could not be denied. Even the opposition within that deep schism that threatened to shatter the Sisterhood agreed. But the thought of those human masses in the Scattering, their numbers exploding exponentially, produced a lonely sense of desperation in Odrade.\nWe are so few compared to them.\nSheeana stooped and picked up a pebble. She looked at it a moment and then threw it at the fence beside them. The\npebble sailed through the meshes without touching them.\nOdrade took a firmer grip on herself. The sounds of their footsteps on the blown sand that drifted across this little- used roadway seemed suddenly over-loud. The spindly causeway leading out over the Dar-es-Balat ring-qanat and moat lay no more than two hundred paces ahead at the end of this narrow road.\nSheeana spoke: “I am doing this because you ordered it, Mother. But I still don’t know why.”\nBecause this is the crucible where we test Waff and, through him, reshape the Tleilaxu!\n“It is a demonstration,” Odrade said.\nThat was true. It was not the whole truth, but it served. Sheeana walked head down, gaze intent on where she placed each step. Was this how she always approached her\nShaitan? Odrade wondered. Thoughtful and remote?\nOdrade heard a faint thwocking sound high up behind her. The watchful ornithopters were arriving. They would keep their distance, but many eyes would observe this demonstration.\n“I will dance,” Sheeana said. “That usually calls a big one.”\nOdrade felt her heartbeat quicken. Would the “big one” continue to obey Sheeana despite the presence of two companions?\nThis is suicidal madness!\nBut it had to be done: Taraza’s orders.\nOdrade glanced at the fenced spice yard beside them. The place appeared oddly familiar. More than déjà vu. Inner certainty informed by Other Memories told her this place remained virtually unchanged from ancient times. The design of the spice silos in the yard was as old as Rakis: oval tanks on tall legs, metal and plaz insects waiting stilt-legged to leap upon their prey. She suspected an unconscious message from the original designers: Melange is both boon and bane.\nBeneath the silos, a sandy wasteland where no growth was permitted spread out beside mud-walled buildings, an amoeba arm of Dar-es-Balat reaching almost to the qanat edge. The Tyrant’s long-hidden no-globe had produced a teeming religious community that hid most of its activities behind windowless walls and underground.\nThe secret working of our unconscious desires!\nOnce more, Sheeana spoke: “Tuek is different.”\nOdrade saw Waff’s head lift sharply. He had heard. He would be thinking: Can we conceal things from the Prophet’s messenger?\nToo many people already knew that a Face Dancer masqueraded as Tuek, Odrade thought. The priestly cabal, of course, believed they were giving the Tleilaxu enough netting in which to snare not only the Bene Tleilax but the Sisterhood as well.\nOdrade smelled the biting odors of chemicals that had been used to kill wild growth in the spice storage yard. The odors forced her attention back to necessities. She did not dare indulge in mental wanderings out here! It would be so easy for the Sisterhood to become caught in its own trap.\nSheeana stumbled and emitted a small cry, more irritation than pain. Waff turned his head sharply and looked at Sheeana before returning his attention to the roadway. The child had merely stumbled on a break in the road surface, he saw. Drifted sand concealed places where the roadway had been cracked. The faery structure of the Causeway ahead of him appeared sound, however. Not substantial enough to support one of the Prophet’s descendants, but more than enough for a supplicant human to cross it into the desert.\nWaff thought of himself chiefly as a supplicant.\n| come as a beggar into the land of thy messenger, God.\nHe had his suspicions about Odrade. The Reverend Mother had brought him here to drain him of his knowledge before killing him. With God’s help, | may surprise her yet.\nHe knew his body was proof against an Ixian Probe, although she obviously did not have such a cumbersome device on her person. But it was the strength of his own will and confidence in God’s grace that reassured Waff.\nAnd what if the hand they hold out to us is held out in sincerity?\nThat, too, would be God’s doing.\nAlliance with the Bene Gesserit, firm control of Rakis: What a dream that was! The Shariat ascendant at last and the Bene Gesserit as missionaries.\nWhen Sheeana again missed her footing and uttered another small sound of complaint, Odrade said: “Don’t favor yourself, child!”\nOdrade saw Waff’s shoulders stiffen. He did not like that peremptory manner with his “Blessed One.” There was backbone in the little man. Odrade recognized it as the strength of fanatic", " him. With God’s help, | may surprise her yet.\nHe knew his body was proof against an Ixian Probe, although she obviously did not have such a cumbersome device on her person.

He did not like that peremptory manner with his “Blessed One.” There was backbone in the little man. Odrade recognized it as the strength of fanaticism. Even if the worm came to kill him, Waff would not flee. Faith in God’s will would carry him directly into his own death—unless he were shaken out of his religious security.\nOdrade suppressed a smile. She could follow his thinking process: God will soon reveal His Purpose.\nBut Waff was thinking about his cells growing in the slow renewal at Bandalong. No matter what happened here, his cells would carry on for the Bene Tleilax .. . and for God—a serial-Waff always serving the Great Belief.\n“I can smell Shaitan, you know,” Sheeana said.\n“Right now?” Odrade looked up at the causeway ahead of them. Waff already was a few steps onto that arching surface.\n“No, only when he comes,” Sheeana said.\n“Of course you can, child. Anyone could.”\n“I can smell him a long way off.”\nOdrade inhaled deeply through her nose, sorting the smells from the background of burnt flint: faint whiffs of melange... ozone, something distinctly acid. She motioned\nfor Sheeana to precede her single-file onto the causeway. Waff was holding his steady twenty paces ahead. The Causeway dipped down to the desert some sixty meters ahead of him.\n| will taste the sand at the first opportunity, Odrade thought. That will tell me many things.\nAs she mounted the causeway over the water moat, she looked off to the southwest at a low barrier along the horizon. Abruptly, Odrade was confronted by a compelling Other Memory. There was none of the crispness in it of actual vision, but she recognized it—a mingling of images from the deepest sources within her.\nDamn! she thought. Not now!\nThere was no escape. Such intrusions came with purpose, an unavoidable demand upon her awareness.\nWarning!\nShe squinted at the horizon, allowing the Other Memory to superimpose itself: a long-ago high barrier far away out there .. . people moving along the top of it. There was a faery bridge in that memory-distance, insubstantial and beautiful. It linked one part of that vanished barrier to another part and she knew without seeing it that a river ran beneath that long-gone bridge. The Idaho River! Now, the Superimposed image provided movement: objects falling from the bridge. They were too far away to identify but she had the labels for this image projection now. With a sense of horror and elation, she identified that scene.\nThe faery bridge was collapsing! Tumbling into the river below it.\nThis vision was not some random destruction. This was classical violence carried in many memories, which had come down to her in the moments of spice agony. Odrade could classify the finely tuned components of the image: Thousands of her ancestors had watched that scene in imaginative reconstruction. Not a real visual memory but an assemblage of accurate reports.\nThat is where it happened!\nOdrade stopped and let the image projections have their way with her awareness. Warning! Something dangerous had been identified. She did not try to dig out the warning’s substance. If she did that, she knew it could fall apart in skeins, any one of which might be relevant, but the original certainty would vanish.\nThis thing out there was fixed in the Atreides history. Leto Il, the Tyrant, had fallen to his dissolution from that faery bridge. The great worm of Rakis, the Tyrant God Emperor himself, had been tumbled from that bridge on his wedding peregrination.\nThere! Right there in the Idaho River beneath his destroyed bridge, the Tyrant had been submerged in his own agony. Right there, the transubstantiation from which the Divided God was born—it all began there.\nWhy is that a warning?\nBridge and river had vanished from this land. The high wall that had enclosed the Tyrant’s dryland Sareer was eroded into a broken line on a heat-shimmering horizon.\nIf a worm came now with its encapsulated pearl of the Tyrant’s forever-dreaming memory, would that memory be dangerous? So Taraza’s opposition in the Sisterhood argued.\n“He will awaken!”\nTaraza and her advisors denied even the possibility.\nStill, this claxon from Odrade’s Other Memories could not be shunted aside.\n“Reverend Mother, why have we stopped?”\nOdrade felt her awareness lurch back into an immediate present that demanded her attention. Out there in that warning vision was where the Tyrant’s endless dream began but other dreams intruded. Sheeana stood in front of her with a puzzled expression.\n“I was looking out there.” Odrade pointed. “That was where Shai-hulud began, Sheeana.”\nWaff stopped at the end of the causeway, one step short of the encroaching sand and now about forty paces ahead of Odrade and Sheeana. Odrade’s voice brought him to stiff alertness but he did not turn. Odrade could feel the displeasure in his posture. Waff would not like even a hint of cynicism directed at his Prophet. He always suspected cynicism from Reverend Mothers. Especially where religious matters were concerned. Waff was not yet ready to accept that the long-detested and feared Bene Gesserit might Share his Great Belief. That ground would have to be filled in with care—as was always the way with the Missionaria Protectiva.\n“They say there was a big river,” Sheeana said.\nOdrade heard the lilting note of derision in Sheeana’s voice. The child learned quickly!\nWaff turned and scowled at them. He heard it, too. What was he thinking about Sheeana now?\nOdrade held Sheeana’s shoulder with one hand and pointed with the other. “There was a bridge right there. The great wall of the Sareer was left open there to permit the passage of the Idaho River. The bridge spanned that break.”\nSheeana sighed. “A real river,” she whispered.\n“Not a qanat and too big for a canal,” Odrade said.\n“I’ve never seen a river,” Sheeana said.\n“That was where they dumped Shai-hulud into the river,” Odrade said. She gestured to her left. “Over on this side, many kilometers in that direction, he built his palace.”\n“There’s nothing over there but sand,” Sheeana said.\n“The palace was torn down in the Famine Times,” Odrade said. “People thought there was a hoard of spice in it. They were wrong, of course. He was much too clever for that.”\nSheeana leaned close to Odrade and whispered: “There is a great treasure of the spice, though. The chantings tell about it. I’ve heard it many times. My... they say it’s ina Cave.”\nOdrade smiled. Sheeana referred to the Oral History, of course. And she had almost said: “My father...” meaning her real father who had died in this desert. Odrade already had lured that story from the girl.\nStill whispering close to Odrade’s ear, Sheeana said: “Why is that little man with us? | don’t like him.”\n“It is necessary for the demonstration,” Odrade said.\nWaff took that moment to step off the causeway onto the first soft slope of open sand. He moved with care but no visible hesitation. Once on the sand, he turned, his eyes glistening in the hot sunlight, and stared first at Sheeana and then at Odrade.\nStill that awe in him when he looks at Sheeana, Odrade thought. What great things he believes he will discover here. He will be restored. And the prestige!\nSheeana sheltered her eyes with one hand and studied the desert.\n“Shaitan likes the heat,” Sheeana said. “People hide inside when it’s hot but that’s when Shaitan comes.”\nNot Shai-hulud, Odrade thought. Shaitan! You predicted it well, Tyrant. What else did you know about our times?\nWas it really the Tyrant out there dormant in all of his worm descendants?\nNone of the analyses Odrade had studied gave a sure explanation of what had driven one human being to make himself into a symbiote with that original worm of Arrakis. What went through his mind in the millennia of that awful transformation? Was any of that, even the smallest fragment, preserved in today’s Rakian worms?\n“He is near, Mother,” Sheeana said. “Do you smell him?”\nWaff peered apprehensively at Sheeana.\nOdrade inhaled deeply: a rich swelling of cinnamon on the bitter flint undertones. Fire, brimstone—the crystal-banked inferno of the great worm. She stooped and brought up a pinch of blown sand to her tongue. All of the background\nwas there: the Dune of Other Memory and the Rakis of this day.\nSheeana pointed at an angle to her left, directly into the light breeze from the desert. “Out there. We must hurry.”\nWithout waiting for permission from Odrade, Sheeana ran lightly down the causeway, past Waff and out onto the first dune. She stopped there until Odrade and Waff caught up with her. Off the dune face she led them, up another with sand clogging their passage, out along a great curving barracan with wisps of dusty saltation blowing from its crest. Soon, they had put almost a kilometer between themselves and the water-girded security of Dar-es-Balat.\nAgain, Sheeana stopped.\nWaff came to a panting halt behind her. Perspiration glistened where his stillsuit hood crossed his brow.\nOdrade stopped a pace behind Waff. She took deep, calming breaths while she peered past Waff to where Sheeana’s attention was fixed.\nA furious tide of sand had poured across the desert beyond the dune where they stood, driven by a storm wind. Bedrock lay exposed in a long narrow avenue of giant boulders, which lay scattered and upturned like the broken building blocks of a mad promethean. Through this wild maze, the sand had poured like a river, leaving its signature in deep scratches and gouges, then plunging off a low escarpment to lose itself in more dunes.\n“Down there,” Sheeana said, pointing at the avenue of bedrock. Off their dune she went, sliding and scrambling in spilled sand. At the bottom, she stopped beside a boulder at least twice her height.\nWaff and Odrade paused just behind her.\nThe slipface of another giant barracan, sinuous as the back of a sporting whale, lifted into the silver-blue sky beside them.\nOdrade used the pause to recompose her", "ana’s attention was fixed.\nA furious tide of sand had poured across the desert beyond the dune where they stood, driven by a storm wind.

That mad run had made great demands on flesh.\nWaff, she noted, was red-faced and breathing deeply. The flinty cinnamon smell was oppressive in the confined passage. Waff sniffed and rubbed at his nose with the back of a hand. Sheeana lifted herself on one toe, pivoted and darted ten paces across the rocky avenue. She put one foot up on the sandy incline of the outer dune and lifted both arms to the sky. Slowly at first and then with increasing tempo, she began to dance, moving up onto the sand.\nThe ‘thopter sounds grew louder overhead.\n“Listen!” Sheeana called, not pausing in her dance.\nIt was not to the ‘thopters that she called their attention. Odrade turned her head to present both ears to a new sound intruding on their rock-tumbled maze.\nA sibilant hiss, subterranean and muted by sand—it became louder with shocking swiftness. There was heat in it, a noticeable warming of the breeze that twisted down their rocky avenue. The hissing swelled to a crescendo roar. Abruptly, the crystal-ringed gaping of a gigantic mouth lifted over the dune directly above Sheeana.\n“Shaitan!” Sheeana screamed, not breaking the rhythm of her dance. “Here | am, Shaitan!”\nAs it crested the dune, the worm dipped its mouth downward toward Sheeana. Sand cascaded around her feet, forcing her to stop her dance. The smell of cinnamon filled the rocky defile. The worm stopped above them.\n“Messenger of God,” Waff breathed.\nHeat dried the perspiration on Odrade’s exposed face and made the automatic insulation of her stillsuit puff outward perceptibly. She inhaled deeply, sorting the components behind that cinnamon assault. The air around them was Sharp with ozone and swiftly oxygen rich. Her senses at full alert, Odrade stored impressions.\nIf I survive, she thought.\nYes, this was valuable data. The day might come when others would use it.\nSheeana backed out of the spilled sand onto the exposed rock. She resumed her dance, moving more wildly, flinging her head at each turn. Hair whipped across her face and each time she whirled to confront the worm, she screamed “Shaitan!”\nDaintily, like a child on unfamiliar ground, the worm once more moved forward. It slid across the dune crest, curled itself down onto the exposed rock and presented its burning mouth slightly above and about two paces from Sheeana.\nAs it stopped, Odrade became conscious of the deep furnace rumbling of the worm. She could not tear her gaze away from the reflections of lambent orange flames within the creature. It was a cave of mysterious fire.\nSheeana stopped her dance. She clenched both fists at her sides and stared back at the monster she had summoned.\nOdrade took timed breaths, the controlled pacing of a Reverend Mother gathering all of her powers. If this was the end—well, she had obeyed Taraza’s orders. Let the Mother Superior learn what she would from the watchers overhead.\n“Hello, Shaitan,” Sheeana said. “I have brought a Reverend Mother and a man of the Tleilaxu with me.”\nWaff slumped to his knees and bowed.\nOdrade slipped past him to stand beside Sheeana.\nSheeana breathed deeply. Her face was flushed.\nOdrade heard the click-ticking of their overworked stillsuits. The hot, cinnamon-drenched air around them was charged with the sounds of this meeting, all dominated by the murmurous burning within the quiescent worm.\nWaff came up beside Odrade, his trancelike gaze fixed on the worm.\n“lam here,” he whispered.\nOdrade silently cursed him. Any unwarranted noise could attract this beast onto them. She knew what Waff was thinking, though: No other Tleilaxu had ever stood this close\nto a descendant of his Prophet. Not even the Rakian priests had ever done this!\nWith her right hand, Sheeana made a sudden downward gesture. “Down to us, Shaitan!” she said.\nThe worm lowered its gaping mouth until the internal firepit filled the rocky defile in front of them.\nHer voice little more than a whisper, Sheeana said: “See how Shaitan obeys me, Mother?”\nOdrade could feel Sheeana’s control over the worm, a pulse of hidden language between child and monster. It was uncanny.\nHer voice rising in impudent arrogance, Sheeana said: “I will ask Shaitan to let us ride him!” She scrambled up the Slipface of the dune beside the worm.\nImmediately, the great mouth lifted to follow her movements. “Stay there!” Sheeana shouted. The worm stopped.\nIt’s not her words that command it, Odrade thought. Something else... something else...\n“Mother, come with me,” Sheeana called.\nThrusting Waff ahead of her, Odrade obeyed. They scrambled up the sandy slope behind Sheeana. Dislodged sand spilled down beside the waiting worm, piling up in the defile. Ahead of them, the worm’s tapering tail curved along the dune crest. Sheeana led them at a sand-clotted trot to the very tip of the thing. There, she gripped the leading edge of a ring in the corrugated surface and scrambled up onto her desert beast.\nMore slowly, Odrade and Waff followed. The worm’s warm surface felt non-organic to Odrade, as though it were some Ixian artifact.\nSheeana skipped forward along the back and squatted just behind its mouth where the rings bulged thick and wide.\n“Like this,” Sheeana said. She leaned forward and clutched beneath the leading edge of a ring, lifting it slightly to expose pink softness underneath.\nWaff obeyed her immediately but Odrade moved with more caution, storing impressions. The ring surface was as hard as plascrete and covered with tiny encrustations. Odrade’s fingers probed the softness under the leading edge. It pulsed faintly. The surface around them lifted and fell with an almost imperceptible rhythm. Odrade heard a tiny rasping with each movement.\nSheeana kicked the worm surface behind her.\n“Shaitan, go!” she said.\nThe worm did not respond.\n“Please, Shaitan,” Sheeana pleaded.\nOdrade heard the desperation in Sheeana’s voice. The child was so confident of her Shaitan but Odrade knew that the girl had been allowed to ride only that first time. Odrade had the full story from death-wish to priestly confusion but none of it told her what would happen next.\nAbruptly, the worm lurched into motion. It lifted sharply, twisted to the left and made a tight curve out of the rocky defile, then moved directly away from Dar-es-Balat into the open desert.\n“We go with God!” Waff shouted.\nThe sound of his voice shocked Odrade. Such wildness! She sensed the power in his faith. The thwock-thwock of following ornithopters came from overhead. The wind of their passage whipped past Odrade full of ozone and the hot furnace odors stirred up by the friction of the rushing behemoth.\nOdrade glanced over her shoulders at the ’thopters, thinking how easy it would be for enemies to rid this planet of a troublesome child, an equally troublesome Reverend Mother and a despised Tleilaxu—all in one violently vulnerable moment on the open desert. The priestly cabal might attempt it, she knew, hoping that Odrade’s own watchers up there would be too late to prevent it.\nWould curiosity and fear hold them back?\nOdrade admitted to a mighty curiosity herself.\nWhere is this thing taking us?\nCertainly, it was not headed toward Keen. She lifted her head and peered past Sheeana. On the horizon directly ahead lay that telltale indentation of fallen stones, that place where the Tyrant had been spilled from the surface of his faery bridge.\nThe place of Other Memory warning.\nAbrupt revelation locked Odrade’s mind. She understood the warning. The Tyrant had died at a place of his own choosing. Many deaths had left their imprint on that place but his the greatest. The Tyrant chose his peregrination route with purpose. Sheeana had not told her worm to go there. It moved that way of its own volition. The magnet of the Tyrant’s endless dream drew it back to the place where the dream began.\nThere was this drylander who was asked which was more important, a literjon of water or a vast pool of water? The drylander thought a moment and then said: “The literjon is more important. No single person could own a great pool of water. But a literjon you could hide under your cloak and run away with it. No one would know.”\n—THE JOKES OF ANCIENT DUNE, BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nt was a long session in the no-globe’s practice hall,\nDuncan in a mobile cage driving the exercise, adamant that this particular training series would continue until his new body had adapted to the seven central attitudes of combat response against attack from eight directions.

Before they had been into it five days, Teg doubted the superiority of modern methods. Now, he was convinced that Duncan did something completely new—mixing the old with what he had learned in the Keep.\nTeg sat at his own control console, as much an observer as a participant. The consoles that guided the dangerous shadow forces in this practice had required mental adjustment by Teg, but he felt familiar with them now and moved the attack with facility and frequent inspiration.\nA simmering Lucilla glanced into the hall occasionally. She watched and then left without comment. Teg did not know what Duncan was doing about the Imprinter but there was a feeling that the reawakened ghola played a delaying game with his seductress. She would not allow that to continue long, Teg knew, but it was out of his hands. Duncan no\nlonger was “too young” for the Imprinter. That young body carried a mature male mind with experiences from which to make his own decisions.\nDuncan and Teg had been on the floor with only one break all morning. Hunger pangs gnawed at Teg but he felt reluctant to halt the session.
