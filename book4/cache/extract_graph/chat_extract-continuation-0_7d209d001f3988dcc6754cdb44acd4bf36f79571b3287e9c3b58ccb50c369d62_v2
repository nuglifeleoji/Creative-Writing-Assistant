\n　　晓霞立刻对他说明了来意。 \n　　孙少平听后，犹豫了一会，说：“既然养民盛情邀请，我得去一下，什么时候？” \n　　“今天晚上，你把金波也叫上，我在学校门口等你们。”“那好吧！你要不要去一下我住的地方？” \n　　晓霞笑着说：“我不敢到府上去打扰了。我贸然跑到这地方找你，已经叫你见怪了吧？” \n　　少平抬头望了望脚手架，见所有的工匠仍然不干活，站下“观赏”他们。他脸通红，说：“不，我很高兴，甚至还有点……骄傲！” \n　　晓霞明白这句话的意思。她也红了脸，说：“那我就先走了，你们可一定要来啊……” \n　　少平就替她推着自行车，走过坑坑洼洼的建筑工地，一直把她送到柴油机厂大门口。 \n　　送走晓霞后，少平的心仍然突突地跳着。真的，他高兴，也有些得意。晓霞来这样的地方找他，让与他一起干活的工匠们羡慕不已，这使他感到一种男人虚荣心的极大满足；至于到顾养民家里去聚会，那倒是一件十分平常的事了。 \n　　他返回工地，给站场的工头请了假，就先到他的住处去换了身干净衣服，便动身去东关找金波。 \n　　金波听说顾养民请他们去吃饭，既意外又有点作难。我们知道，高中时为少平和红梅的事，他曾策划和组织了那次打顾养民的事件。虽然这事已经过了好几年，但仍然记忆犹新。 \n　　他于是对少平说：“我还是不去了。你一个人去，就说你没找见我……” \n　　少平笑了，说：“还为过去那事吗？咱们现在都不是小孩了，顾养民也不会计较这些事，否则他不会邀请咱们。咱们不去，反倒失了风格。” \n　　金波想了一下，说：“那就去吧！” \n　　于是，这两个人在下午五点钟左右，一块相跟着去了北关的黄原师专。 \n　　晓霞早已在学校大门口笑吟吟地等待他们了三个人进了顾养民家。 \n　　养民兴奋地拉住他们的手摇了半天。他和保姆一块动手，早已经准备好了一桌饭菜。他还把父亲的小酒柜打开，把所有的白酒、红酒、啤酒都拿了出来。 \n　　四个老同学围着桌子先后落座。亲切、兴奋，又有点百感交集。 \n　　几年前，他们还是少年。现在却都成了大人，而且每个人都已经有过一些生活的经历。当年，他们还为一些事闹过孩子式的别扭。现在想起来，连这些别扭都值得人怀恋！中学时代的生活啊，将永远鲜活地保持在每个人一生的记忆之中；即是我们进入垂暮之年，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
