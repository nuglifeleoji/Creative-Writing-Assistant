\n　　千山万岭之中，绿意盎然，野花缤纷；庄稼人赤膊裸体，进入了一年一度的繁忙季节。令人醉心的信天游在无边的高原上不断头地飘荡。大自然和人的生活都随着夏天的到来而变得丰富多彩。 \n　　黄原城也一改冬日的灰暗，重新展现出它的活力和生机。瞧，街道两旁的中国槐和法国梧桐，都翻起了绿色的波浪；大大小小的街心花园，五颜六色的鲜花开得耀眼夺目，黄原河还未进入汛期，河水清澈透底，甚至能看见水中墨点似的蝌蚪和缠绕着蛤蟆衣的鹅卵石。在古塔山那里，几个古色古香的凉亭，已经深埋在树海之中；远远望去，会激起人许多诗意的联想，犹如梦境中出现的江南景象。大街上，姑娘们都穿起了鲜艳的花裙子，满眼都是流彩飞霞。因为没有了取暖炉子冒出的黑烟，城市上空洁净如洗，豁然开朗；人们倏忽间就象生活在了另一个世界。 \n　　在这些火辣辣的日子里，地委书记田福军忙得象热锅上的蚂蚁，团团乱转。 \n　　前不久，省委派来工作组在黄原搞党政机关机构改革。说穿了，这是一次人事大变动。因此上上下下刮风下雨，闹得云来雾去，不可开交。 \n　　根据中央和省委的指示，地区一级新的领导班子年龄在五十岁以下的要占三分之一，大专文化程度的要占三分之一，而且要采取个人推荐和组织推荐相结合，民意测验与组织考察相结合，下级党组织考察与党委人事安排小组考察相结合的办法。一旦地委行署新的领导班子组成，便立即着手各部、局、委、办的机构改革工作。所有这一切，当然要牵扯许多领导干部的命运；而一个领导或上或下，又牵扯一批干部的命运。 \n　　不必讳言，在中国及其执政党内，干部中大山头不明显，但小山头小圈子则处处存在，世人皆知。因此，在那些日子里，黄原地委和行署都乱得没人上班了。干部们四处乱跑，搞各种秘密活动。省里来的工作组，几乎没明没黑被许多人包围着，倾听这些人说某个领导的好话或坏话……现在，这场混乱终于结束了。地委行署的班子变化很大。老人手除过他、正文和世宽没有改变外，年龄大点的都退到了二线，继而上任的副书记副专员都是一些年轻而有大专文凭的干部。 \n　　田福军本人比较满意这个新班子。当然，他知道许多干部对此有各种不同意见和看法。 \n　　新班子组成之后，各部局和县的领导机构也进行了相应的改革。这样，工作才逐步转入了正常，�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
