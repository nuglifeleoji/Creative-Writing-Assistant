，变成森林和花园，农业和农业部也随之消失。农业部取消后，他领导地外行星开发，用小球藻改造金星那闷热的大气，30年后，也就是超新星纪年76年，他在金星建立了人类第一座城市，实现了九十多年前华华那梦幻般的理想。接着，他又把目光投向更远的外层行星。授勋仪式结束后，11位老人，超新星纪元国家的第一批部长，到他家里去看望他。他们在花园中找到了他，发现他的花园中种了许多奇怪的植物，那些植物的外形毫无观赏价值，而他们已几乎忘了种植活动除了给人提供一个接近和观赏大自然的机会外，还有什么其它用处。当年的那个穿着走掉底的大鞋的孩子现在仍很健康，看上去比他们谁都年轻，他正用一把奇怪的器具（一根长木杆头上固定着一片与木杆垂直的金属片）在那些植物中间挖着什么，一个小桌子上放着他挖出来的东西，那是一堆呈两个连在一起的蛋形的小东西，他的孙子用胖乎乎的小手捧起一捧向他们走来，在玫瑰星云的光芒下他们呆呆地看着那个孩子。\n　　“吃吧，这是爷爷种的花生！”\n\n　　五、超级管理者\n\n　　超新星纪元第7小时\n　　当华华和小部长们乘电梯上到大厦顶层，走进通讯中心大厅时，听到看不见的超级电脑对他们说：\n　　“FG认为国家政府已经恢复，FG现在为国家政府工作，请给出指令。”\n　　“告诉我们，现在外面怎么样了，小朋友们都好吗？”小梦问FG。\n　　一面半透明墙壁上又出现了那幅壮观的全国地图。上面新加上了许多彩色的标志。\n　　“现在国土上出现了10377处构成威胁的火灾，大部分为输电系统事故引起。构成威胁的水灾较少，只有4处，其中3处是小型水库闸门没有及时开启引起，1处是贮水罐破裂引起；黄河春汛刚过，水情缓和，中下游河堤没有发现危险段；长江珠江松花江和汉江等大河也基本处于安全状态；各大河上的所有梯级大型水电站，在FG的控制下溢流孔闸门均已处于开启状态，不会构成危险。目前只有1.31% 的国土面积处于危险气候条件下，其中主要是西北地区的冷空气流。没有发现地震火山等其它大规模自然灾害的迹象。目前全国人口中有2.379%处于疾病之中，这个比例增长很快；3.158% 的人口缺少食物，2.090% 的人口缺少卫生的饮用水，0.001%的人口缺少衣物……总的来说，目前国土范围内不存在十分巨大危险。现在威胁生命和财产的主要危险是火灾，目前火灾已造成了138229741039元的财产损失，人员伤亡尚不清楚，估计不会很大。另外一个重大损失是由电力的突然恢复引起的，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
