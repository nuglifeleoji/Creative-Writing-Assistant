He is depicted as a participant in various activities, often causing disruption and chaos. Despite his involvement in the fighting, which leads to damage and turmoil among others, he does so without a clear understanding of the underlying reasons for the conflict. This lack of awareness adds a layer of complexity to his character, as he engages in the fray without fully grasping the implications of his actions.\n\nIn addition to his role in conflict, 田牛 also humorously disrupts festivities, contributing to a lively and celebratory atmosphere. His antics, while sometimes problematic, are infused with a sense of humor that can lighten the mood, making him a memorable figure during both serious and joyous occasions. This duality in his character—being both a source of chaos and a bringer of laughter—highlights his unique position within the village dynamics.\n\n田牛 is described as the \"\"憨小子\"\" (simpleton) of 田二, indicating a certain endearing quality to his character.
