快了，几乎是须臾之间就到了三头百年熔岩犬身边，可是，他的长枪还没有挑出，却因为速度太快，竟是从三头熔岩犬身前一掠而过，然后就到了蓝轩宇面前……\n\n    “你……”蓝轩宇已经不知道该说什么才好了，赶忙右手抓向他，起码先把他拦截下来，两人面对三犬，总会效果好一些。\n\n    右手覆盖了金纹蓝银草力量极大，果然一把抓住了刘锋，而此时的刘锋却只觉得蓝轩宇右手之中一股灼热涌入自己体内，烫的他大叫一声，猛然一回身，白龙枪朝着那三头百年熔岩犬挥去。\n\n    “昂——”低沉的龙吟声中，白龙枪表面仿佛真的有一头白龙涌现似的，枪芒喷吐，本来就距离很近，这一下，距离本来是不够的，可在枪芒的作用下，竟然真的将三头百年熔岩犬卷入其中，全都挑了起来。\n\n    “好！”蓝轩宇一步跨出，超越刘锋，气沉丹田，气血逆运，刹那间，他整个人身上的金色光芒大盛，一股难以形容的强大气势骤然从他身上爆发出来。\n\n    低沉的嗡鸣声在他身体周围化为龙吟，伴随着龙吟激昂，双手猛然向空中推出。\n\n    正是，半成品版本的，金龙升天！\n\n    在现实世界之中，蓝轩宇真不敢用这招对敌，没有娜娜的辅助，他根本无法完全将其施展出来，每次施展，都会把自己抽空的一干二净。甚至要几天才能缓过劲来。\n\n    可这是斗罗世界啊！先前他们在完成考核之后，身体状态直接就恢复了。这也让他动了要在这里面尝试练习金龙升天的想法。此时全力施展，蓝轩宇发现，和以前相比，似乎是轻松了那么几分。连他自己也不知道为什么，好像自己那逆运中的气血要比以前更加听话了似的。\n\n    “轰——”三头熔岩犬被金色席卷，瞬间化为光芒。\n\n    ……\n\n    “嗯？”唐乐抬起头，看向空中，看向某个方向，眉头微蹙，默默的闭上双眸。一抹淡淡的金色光晕也随之从他身体表面浮现而出。紧接着，他脸上流露出一丝痛苦，金芒也随之收敛起来。\n\n    ……\n\n    “老师，为什么啊？他们说那是天罗星。他们竟然能把我召唤过去。还说是什么空间的奥秘，这可能吗？”一头深蓝色长发的少女撅着红唇，一脸不解的同时，还带着几分娇憨。\n\n    而此时，如果蓝轩宇能在她身边，就会吃惊的发现，这深蓝发少女身前站着的，正是他朝思暮想，有着那银发紫眸的娜娜老师啊！\n\n    娜娜眉头微�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a
