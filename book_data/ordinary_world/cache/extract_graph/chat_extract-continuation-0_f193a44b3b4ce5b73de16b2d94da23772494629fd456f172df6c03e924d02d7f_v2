步。好马不吃回头草！如果他真的被煤矿辞退，他就去铜城谋生；揽工，掏粪，扫大街，都可以……他猛然想到，他实际上血压并不高，只是因为心情过于紧张才造成了如此后果；他怎能甘心这样一种偶然因素就被淘汰呢？ \n　　“不！”他喊叫说。他从床上一跃而起。他想，他决不能这样被动地等待命运的宰割。在这最危险的时候，应该象伟大的贝多芬所说：我要扼住命运的咽喉，它决不会使我完全屈服！ \n                  第3章\n　　万般焦灼的孙少平首先想到了那位量血压的大夫。他想，在明天上午复查之前，他一定要先找找这位决定他命运的女神。 \n　　打问好女大夫住宿的地方，时间已经到了下午。晚饭他只从食堂里带回两个馒头，也无心下咽，便匆忙地从宿舍走出来，下了护坡路那几十个台阶，来到矿区中间的马路上。 \n　　他先到东面矿部那里的小摊前，从身上仅有的七块钱中拿出五块，买了一网兜苹果，然后才折转身向西面的干部家属楼走去。直到现在，孙少平还没想好他找到女大夫该怎说。但买礼物这一点他一开始就想到了。这是中国人办事的首要条件。这几斤苹果是太微不足道了——本来，从走后门的行情看，要办这么大的事，送块手表或一辆自行车也算不了什么。只是他身上实在没钱了。不论怎样，提几斤苹果总比赤手空拳强！ \n　　现在，又是夜晚了。矿区再一次亮起灿若星河的灯火。沟底里传来了一片模糊的人的嘈杂声——大概是晚场电影就要开映了。 \n　　女大夫会不会去看电影呢？但愿她没去！不过，即使去了，他也要立在她家门口等她回来。要是今晚上找不到她，一切就为时过晚了——明天早晨八点钟就要复查！孙少平提着那几斤苹果，急行在夜晚凉飕飕的秋风中。额头上冒着热汗，他不时撩起布衫襟子揩一把。快进家属区的路段两旁，挤满了卖小吃的摊贩，油烟蒸气混合着飘满街头，吆喝声此起彼伏。那些刚上井的单身矿工正围坐在脏乎乎的小桌旁，吃着喝着，挥舞着胳膊在猜拳喝令。 \n　　家属区相对来说是宁静的。一幢幢四层楼房排列得错落有致；从那些亮着灯火的窗口传出中央电视台播音员赵忠祥浑厚的声音——新闻联播已近尾声，时间约摸快到七点半了。他找到了八号楼。他从四单元黑暗的楼道里拾级而上。他神经绷得象拉满的弓弦。由于没吃饭，上楼时两腿很绵软。 \n　　黑暗中，他竟然在二楼的水泥台阶上�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
