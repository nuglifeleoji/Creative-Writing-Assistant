Two Mentats together. Must we play these stupid games?”\nBellonda took a deep breath and sought Mentat mode. Not easy under these circumstances, that child staring at her, the amusement on Idaho’s face. Was Odrade displaying\nan unsuspected slyness? Working against a Sister with this ghola?\nIdaho relaxed when he saw Bene Gesserit intensity become that doubled focus of the Mentat. “I’ve known for a long time that you want me dead, Bell.”\nYes ... | have been readable in my fears.\nIt had been very close there, he thought. Bellonda had come to him with death in mind, a little drama to create “the necessity” all prepared. He entertained few illusions about his ability to match her in violence. But Bellonda- Mentat would observe before acting.\n“It’s disrespectful the way you use our first names,” she said, goading.\n“Different recognition, Bell. You’re no longer Reverend Mother and I’m not ‘the ghola.’ Two human beings with common problems. Don’t tell me you’re unaware of this.”\nShe glanced around his workroom. “If you expected me why didn’t you have Murbella here?”\n“Force her to kill you while protecting me?”\nBellonda assessed this. The damned Honored Matre probably could kill me, but then... “You sent her away to protect her.”\n“I’ve a better protector.” He gestured at the child.\nTeg? A protector? There were those stories from Gammu about him. Does Idaho know something?\nShe wanted to ask but did she dare risk diversion? Watchdogs must receive a clear scenario of danger.\n“Him?”\n“Would he serve the Bene Gesserit if he saw you kill me?” When she did not answer, he said: “Put yourself in my place, Bell. l'm a Mentat caught not only in your trap but in\nthat of the Honored Matres.”\n“Is that all you are, a Mentat?”\n“No. I’m a Tleilaxu experiment but | don’t see the future. I’m not a Kwisatz Haderach. I’m a Mentat with memories of\nmany lives. You, with your Other Memories—think about the leverage that gives me.”\nWhile he was speaking, Teg came to lean against the console at Idaho’s elbow. The boy’s expression was one of curiosity but she saw no fear of her.\nIdaho gestured at the projection focus over his head, silver motes dancing there ready to create their images. “A Mentat sees his relays producing discrepancies—winter scenes in summer, sunshine when his visitors have come through rain... Didn’t you expect me to discount your little playlets?”\nShe heard Mentat summation. To that extent, they shared common teaching. She said: “You naturally told yourself not to minimize the Tao.”\n“I asked different questions. Things that happen together can have underground links. What is cause and effect when confronted with simultaneity?”\n“You had good teachers.”\n“And not just in one life.”\nTeg leaned toward her. “Did you really come here to kill him?”\nNo sense lying. “I still think he is too dangerous.” Let watchdogs argue that!\n“But he’s going to give me back my memories!”\n“Dancers on a common floor, Bell,” Idaho said. “Tao. We may not appear to dance together, may not use the same steps or rhythms but we are seen together.”\nShe began to suspect where he might be leading and wondered if there might be another way to destroy him.\n“| don’t know what you're talking about,” Teg said.\n“Interesting coincidences,” Idaho said.\nTeg turned to Bellonda. “Maybe you would explain, please?”\n“He’s trying to tell me we need each other.”\n“Then why doesn’t he say so?”\n“It’s more subtle than that, boy.” And she thought: The record must show me warning Idaho. “The nose of the donkey doesn’t cause the tail, Duncan, no matter how often you see the beast pass that thin vertical space limiting your view of it.”\nIdaho met Bellonda’s fixed gaze. “Dar came here once with a sprig of apple blossoms, but my projection showed harvest time.”\n“It’s riddles, isn’t it?” Teg said, clapping his hands.\nBellonda recalled the record of that visit. Precise movements by Mother Superior. “You didn’t suspect a hothouse?”\n“Or that she just wanted to please me?”\n“Am | supposed to guess?” Teg asked.\nAfter a long silence, Mentat gaze locked to Mentat gaze, Idaho said: “There’s anarchy behind my confinement, Bell. Disagreement in your highest councils.”\n“There can be deliberation and judgment even in anarchy,” she said.\n“You're a hypocrite, Bell!”\nShe drew back as though he had struck her, a purely involuntary movement that shocked her by the forced reaction. Voice? No... something reaching deeper. She was suddenly terrified of this man.\n“I find it marvelous that a Mentat and a Reverend Mother could be such a hypocrite,” he said.\nTeg tugged at Idaho’s arm. “Are you fighting?”\nIdaho brushed the hand away. “Yes, we’re fighting.”\nBellonda could not tear her gaze from Idaho’s. She wanted to turn and flee. What was he doing? This had gone completely awry!\n“Hypocrites and criminals among you?” he asked.\nOnce more, Bellonda remembered the comeyes. He was playing not only her but the watchers as well! And doing it with exquisite care. She was suddenly filled with admiration for his performance but this did not allay her fear.\n“I ask why your Sisters tolerate you?” His lips moved with such delicate precision! “Are you a necessary evil? A source of valuable data and, occasionally, good advice?”\nShe found her voice. “How dare you?” Guttural and containing all of her vaunted viciousness.\n“It could be that you strengthen your Sisters.” Voice flat, not changing tone in the slightest. “Weak links create places others must reinforce and that would strengthen those others.”\nBellonda realized she was barely keeping her hold on Mentat mode. Could any of this be true? Was it possible Mother Superior saw her that way?\n“You came with criminal disobedience in mind,” he said. “All in the name of necessity! A little drama for the comeyes, proving you had no other choice.”\nShe found his words restoring Mentat abilities. Did he do that knowingly? She was fascinated by the need to study his manner as well as his words. Did he really read her that well? The record of this encounter might be far more valuable than her little playlet. And the outcome no different!\n“You think Mother Superior’s wishes are law?” she asked.\n“Do you really think me unobservant?” Waving a hand at Teg, who started to interrupt. “Bell! Be only a Mentat.”\n“I hear you.” And so do many others!\n“I’m deep into your problem.”\n“We've given you no problem!”\n“But you have. You have, Bell. You’re misers the way you parcel out the pieces but | see it.”\nBellonda abruptly remembered Odrade saying: “I don’t need a Mentat! | need an inventor.”\n“You...need...me,” Idaho said. “Your problem is still in its shell but the meat’s there and must be extracted.”\n“Why would we possibly need you?”\n“You need my imagination, my inventiveness, things that kept me alive in the face of Leto’s wrath.”\n”\n“You've said he killed you so many times you lost count. Eat your own words, Mentat!\nHe gave her an exquisitely controlled smile, so precise that neither she nor the comeyes could mistake its intent. “But how can you trust me, Bell?”\nHe condemns himself!\n“Without something new you're doomed,” he said. “Only a matter of time and you all know it. Perhaps not this generation. Perhaps not even the next one. But inevitably.”\nTeg pulled sharply at Idaho’s sleeve. “The Bashar could help, couldn’t he?”\nSo the boy really listened. Idaho patted Teg’s arm. “The Bashar’s not enough.” Then to Bellonda: “Underdogs together. Must we growl over the same bone?”\n“You've said that before.” And doubtless will say it again.\n“Still Mentat?” he asked. “Then discard drama! Get the romantic haze off our problem.”\nDar’s the romantic! Not me!\n“What’s romantic,” he asked, “about little pockets of Scattered Bene Gesserit waiting to be slaughtered?”\n“You think none will escape?”\n“You're seeding the universe with enemies,” he said. “You're feeding Honored Matres!”\nShe was fully (and only) Mentat then, required to match this ghola ability for ability. Drama? Romance? The body got in the way of Mentat performance. Mentats must use the body, not let it interfere.\n“No Reverend Mother you’ve Scattered has ever returned or sent a message,” he said. “You try to reassure yourselves by saying only the Scattered ones know where they go. How can you ignore the message they send in this other fact? Why has not one tried to communicate with Chapterhouse?”\nHe’s chiding all of us, damn him! And he’s right.\n“Have | stated our problem in its most elemental form?”\nMentat questioning!\n“Simplest question, simplest projection,” she agreed.\n“Amplified sexual ecstasy: Bene Gesserit imprint? Are Honored Matres trapping your people out there?”\n“Murbella?” A one-word challenge. Assess this woman you say you love! Does she know things we should know?\n“They’re conditioned against raising their own enjoyment to addictive levels but they are vulnerable.”\n“She denies there are Bene Gesserit sources in Honored Matre history.”\n“As she was conditioned to do.”\n“A lust for power instead?”\n“At last, you have asked a proper question.” And when she did not reply, he said: “Mater Felicissima.” Addressing her by the ancient term for Bene Gesserit Council members.\nShe knew why he did it and felt the word produce the wanted effect. She was firmly balanced now. Mentat Reverend Mother encompassed by the mohalata of her own Spice Agony—that union of benign Other Memory protecting her from domination by malignant ancestors.\nHow did he know to do that? Every observer behind the comeyes would be asking that question. Of course! The Tyrant trained him thus, time and time again. What do we have here? What is this talent Mother Superior dares employ? Dangerous, yes, but far more valuable than | suspected. By the gods of our own creation! Is he the tool to free us?\nHow calm he was. He knew he had caught her.\n“In one of my lives, Bell, | visited your Bene Gesserit house on Wallach IX and there talked to one of your ancestors, Tersius Helen Anteac. Let her guide you, Bell. She knows.”\nBellonda felt familiar prodding in her mind. How could he know Anteac was my ancestor?\n“I went to Wallach IX at the Tyrant’s command,” he said. “Oh, yes! | often thought of him as Tyrant. My orders were to Suppress the Mentat school you thought you had hidden there.”\nAnteac-simulflow intruded: “/ show you now the event of which he speaks.”\n“Consider,” he said. “I, a Mentat, forced to suppress a school that trained people the way | was trained. | knew why he ordered it, of course, and so do you.”\nSimul\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a character involved in the conversation, possibly a Bene Gesserit or related to the Missionaria Protectiva\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and a Mentat, involved in a tense confrontation with Duncan Idaho\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola and a Mentat with memories of multiple lives, engaged in a strategic dialogue with Bellonda\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a child with potential significance, possibly a Bashar or protector, involved in the conversation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is an Honored Matre and a significant figure in the Bene Gesserit's plans\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Bene Gesserit Mother Superior, referenced in the conversation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and dominant faction opposed to the Bene Gesserit\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLIELAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a faction known for genetic experimentation, including the creation of gholas\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KWISATZ HADERACH<|>EVENT<|>The Kwisatz Haderach is a prophesied superbeing, referenced in the context of Duncan Idaho's abilities\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The Spice Agony is a transformative ritual for Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>WALLACH IX<|>GEO<|>Wallach IX is a planet with a Bene Gesserit school, referenced in Duncan Idaho's memories\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is a planet mentioned in stories about Teg\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapterhouse is the Bene Gesserit's central planet\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Bellonda and Duncan Idaho engage in a Mentat confrontation, with Bellonda initially intending to kill him<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TEG<|>Duncan Idaho refers to Teg as a potential protector<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MURBELLA<|>Duncan Idaho has a relationship with Murbella, an Honored Matre<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Bellonda is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan Idaho is a tool or experiment of the Bene Gesserit<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres are enemies of the Bene Gesserit<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLIELAXU<|>Duncan Idaho is a Tleilaxu experiment<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>KWISATZ HADERACH<|>Duncan Idaho denies being the Kwisatz Haderach but has related abilities<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>ODRADE<|>Bellonda is subordinate to Odrade, the Mother Superior<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GAMMU<|>Teg is associated with stories from Gammu<|>4\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>WALLACH IX<|>Duncan Idaho has memories of visiting Wallach IX<|>6\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
