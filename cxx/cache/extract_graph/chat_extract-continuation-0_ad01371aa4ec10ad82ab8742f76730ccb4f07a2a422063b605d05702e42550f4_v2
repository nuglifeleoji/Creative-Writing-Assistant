这件事上的表演大加抨击，使得在雷克雅未克的两国最高级首脑会唔上，美国总统有一种站在被告席上的尴尬。\n　　但苏联人也付出了代价，他们不得不承认曾掩盖了六十年代一次恶性航天事故的真象。\n　　那次航天事故发生在1967年4月23日，当时苏联宇宙飞船联盟1号从太空轨道再入大气层，飞船上的宇航员是科马洛夫，4月24日莫斯科电台发布的那篇暗淡的新闻是这样描述的：“……当地面接应人员打开着陆舱的密封门后，看到舱内已没有生命迹象……”关于这次事故的原因众说纷纭，西方航天专家们大都持以下两种看法：再入时着陆舱的密封失效，宇航员窒息而死；或着陆舱在下降的最后阶段，即在距地面700米左右时发生不可控制的自旋，至使刚被拉出的降落伞缠绕在一起没能张开。\n　　还有许多其它说法，其中有些很富有想象力，但谁也没有把这次事故同当时的一次太阳黑子活动异常相联系。事实上，在太阳黑子活动突然加剧在那段时间内，宇宙员曾走出舱外检修被微陨石损坏的密封蒙皮，当时他们完全暴露在强烈的太阳风之中，而他们只穿着轻便型宇宙服，这种宇宙服没有防高能辐射的铅制内衬。两名宇宙员死于SLER病，被葬在哈萨克共和国拜克努尔的宇航员公墓中，而从此开始，苏联投入巨大的力量研究SLER。没人知道为什么这项研究在近四十年的时间内一直处于高度机密的状态，可能与对核放射的后果研究有关。\n　　研究表明，SLER病有与慢性粒细胞性白血病极为相似的血象和骨髓象特征，这就是它的名称的由来，但它的宏观症状与白血病完全不同。SLER的病程发展如闪电般迅速，患者在受照射后的48小时内死亡。这也是人类死亡率最高的病：100%！SLER还有一个十分神秘的特征：\n　　机体对它的抵抗力与机体的成长时间成反比，即年龄越小的人抵抗力越强。\n　　SLER病的这种特性与生物基因的全息定律有关，全息定律指出，生物基因的某一点都有包括其它所有点信息的趋向，当基因链被辐射破坏后，全息性可使破损的基因从一块碎片中复原，这就是机体抵抗SLER病的分子生物学原理。机体的全息性在机体诞生时最大，这时一粒精细胞和一粒卵细胞就包括了一个机体的全部信息。但随着机体成长，基因全息性也随着减小，这就意味着人类的年龄越大，基因的修复能力越小，对SLER的抵抗力就越小.\n　　研究者们得出了一个经验公式：\n　　Ｙ
