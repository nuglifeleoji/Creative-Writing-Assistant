\n　　少安是田福堂动身去县城的时候，才知道润叶要结婚了。据传回来的消息看，那个男人就是去年原西河畔润叶提起的县上领导的儿子。 \n　　他听到这事后，心里忍不住一阵隐隐地难受。这是很正常的。他爱过这个人，而这个人不仅爱他，还公开向他表示了自己的爱情；只是他没敢接受这爱，跑到山西去给自己找回来了秀莲。但是，在难受之时，他对这消息又不感到意外。这事也是很正常的。他已经结婚了，润叶也总要结婚。事情本来就会是这样的。对于孙少安来说，润叶在他内心掀起的暴风骤雨已经平息了，现在只留下一些细微的痕迹；代之而来的是贺秀莲温暖的感情抚慰他风暴过后的心灵。他祝福亲爱的润叶也能寻找到自己的抚慰。归根结底，也许他们只能这样。人只能按照自己的条件寻找终生伴侣。就好象种庄稼一样，只能把豆角和玉米种在一块，而不能和小麦种在一起。 \n　　听说润叶马上要举行婚礼，少安着急起来——他给人家送什么礼物呢？他和秀莲结婚的时候，润叶给他们送了两块缎被面，少说也值五六十元。而他们现在除过这两块被面，就再没什么值钱东西了。总不能把这两块被面再送回去吧？ \n　　晚上睡觉前，他只好忧愁地对秀莲提起了这件事。“就是那个和你相好过的女子？”妻子自己红着脸问他。“就是的。我们小时候一块耍大的……人家给咱送了那么重的礼，咱给人家送什么呢？”少安熬煎地问秀莲。秀莲想了一下说：“人家有义，咱不能无情！我看是这样，我爸走时给丢下五十块钱，我原来准备给你缝一件大氅，钱一直在箱子里搁着。你干脆都拿去，给人家买件象样的东西！” \n　　少安感激地把妻子拉在自己怀里，在她脸上亲了亲。 \n　　于是，他就拿着秀莲给他的五十块钱，跑到米家镇用四十六块钱，买了一块黄原出的羊毛毯。剩下的四块钱，他给秀莲买了一条围巾。星期天少平回学校时，他就把毛毯让少平捎给田福堂，让他转交给润叶夫妇……这件事过后不久，一九七六年就临近结束了。 \n　　阳历年底前的一天，他丈人贺耀宗突然托顺车给他们捎来二斗小米。这点粮食顿时使一家人高兴万分。这样，在他们那黑豆高粱稀饭里，又能加一点小米了。对农民来说，小米就是最好的粮食；小米煮饭好，又经得住吃，一斤米能顶二斤面。同时，家里也就能腾出更多一些高粱喂那口\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
