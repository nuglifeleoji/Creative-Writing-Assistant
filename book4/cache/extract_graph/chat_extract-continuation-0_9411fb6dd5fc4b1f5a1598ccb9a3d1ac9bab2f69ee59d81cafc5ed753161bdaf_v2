�来。他们羡慕和眼红有能力折腾的人——听一些见多识广的人议论，这土坑里捞出来的将是一把又一把的人民币啊！他们自己只有眼红的份。他们折腾不起。一来手头没有本钱，二来也没魄力到公家门上去贷款。 \n　　再说，就是有钱有魄力，大字不识一个，哪来的技能？弄不好还得倒赔钱。看来他们只能在土地上戳牛屁股罗！可是，他们委实穷得心慌啊……在观看田海民非凡壮举的人堆里，还有他爸田万有和他四爸田万江。 \n　　田四田五老兄弟俩蹲在一起，在人堆里只抽旱烟不说话。如果这是另外的人家，村中首席艺术家田五马上会给众人编出一段逗笑的“链子嘴”来。现在，他蹲在这里却是一副平时少有的沉思面孔。 \n　　田五有他的愁肠。他明年就满六十岁了，家里还有两个十四五岁的小女儿。他这把年纪一个人有山里挣命，勉强能糊住四张嘴，手头紧巴得连化肥也买不回来。两个女娃娃都大了，穿不起一件象样的衣服，经常破衣连身。别看他常在人面前是一个热闹人，其实一个人在山里唱完一段子信天游，便由不得抱头痛哭一场。海民不管他。不是儿子不想管，是儿媳妇不让儿子管。 \n　　蹲在旁边的他哥田万江，日子过得比他还牺惶。田四的三个儿子都另过了光景，一个个老实巴脚，都拉着一窝儿女，根本不可能照顾他们。 \n　　老两口穷得连口锅也买不起，一直用一只漏水的破锅做饭。 \n　　老弟兄俩听说海民要挖池养鱼，就凑到一块拉谈过，看能不能在海民这里入个“股”。他们一没资金，二没技术，但粗笨活可以全包在他们身上。他们估计，尽管儿媳妇银花看不见他们的死活，但他们干重活，拿个小头，也许她能同意。 \n　　现在，他们还没有向海民提这事。不过，他们此刻热心地蹲在这里，心里上倒觉得，这事好象也是他们自己的事；听着推土机的吼叫声，心里怪激动！ \n　　两天以后，鱼池已经挖好了。海民两口子正紧张地做放水前的工作。据那本小册子介绍，放鱼苗前，要用白灰对鱼池消毒。一亩放六百斤生石灰，再泼一层大粪，用犁耕一遍——这样既能消毒，又能生微生物。 \n　　这天上午，田五田四乘银花不在工地，两兄弟就结伴来找海民，向他提出了他们的“建议”。 \n　　海民当时没有拒绝。只是为难地对两位父老说，这要征得他媳妇的同意。海民的家事由银花掌管，他只能把这一点不害臊地向两位老人当面表明。两位老人也知道这是事实，只好等待海民去请示他媳妇。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
