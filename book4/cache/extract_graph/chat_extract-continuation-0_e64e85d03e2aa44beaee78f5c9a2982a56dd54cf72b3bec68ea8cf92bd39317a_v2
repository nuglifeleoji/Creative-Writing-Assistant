�住满肚子的不高兴，对弟弟说：“不管怎样，少安年纪也不小了。人到了年龄，这件事就要考虑。至于财礼钱，到时再向村里人转着借吧。当年你们过事情，还不是借别人的吗？受几年熬煎也就把帐债还了。”孙玉厚忍不住提了点往事。 \n　　玉亭一下子脸通红，不再用一种轻松的口气来说话了。他手在脸上摸了一把，说：“叫我想一想，看哪个女娃娃和少安般配……” \n　　这时候，贺凤英停止了手中的活，从锅台后面转出来，说：“大哥，我娘家族里有个远门侄女，她妈死得早，一直是她爸拉扯大的，劳动和家务活都好。去年我回家时，她爸给我安顿说，看能不能在咱们这面给瞅个人家。只要女婿本人好，他一个财礼钱也不要。我一直没把这当一回事。我看这女娃娃正是少安的媳妇！那女娃娃肯定能看上少安哩！人家又不要财礼！如果少安情愿的话，请上几天假。到柳林那里去一趟，看一下这个女娃娃，又误不了几天功夫……” \n　　孙玉厚一听有不要财礼的女娃娃，一下子从炕拦石上溜下来，他先不考虑其它，立刻对弟媳妇说：“那这没问题！你先给人家去个信，我回去让少安准备一下，就让他尽快走一回柳林！不得成也没关系！这又花不了几个路费！人常我，扣个麻雀还得几颗谷子哩！” \n　　玉亭马上接着说：“那这事好办！我和凤英今天就给柳林那边发信！” \n　　玉厚再不愿多说什么，即刻就出了玉亭院子，往家里走去。一路上他情绪很高涨，觉得他运气不错，无意中碰了一个不要财礼的女娃娃，得赶快回去和少安商量这事，让他过几天就动身走山西！ \n　　孙玉厚赶回家里时，少安已经出山劳动去了。 \n　　老汉压抑不住自己的高兴，就把事情先原原本本给老婆说了一遍。 \n　　少安妈听了老汉的话，一时倒没显出什么激动来。她停了一会，才忧虑地对丈夫说：“不要财礼当然好。可是这女娃娃是贺凤英一个户族的，要是象贺凤英那样的性情，少安一辈子可就要受罪呀！” \n　　孙玉厚热烘烘的头上顿时象浇了一盆子凉水。他由于心急，可没往这方面想。少安妈说得对！要是那女娃娃和贺凤英一样，可的确不敢给少安娶回来。这个家已经经不住折腾了。来个糊涂女人，把少安和一家人折磨得不能安生，还不如先不娶哩。 \n　　孙玉厚蹲在脚地上抽了一会烟，思量了大半天，然后又对少安妈说：“你说得对，也不对。人常说，一娘生九\n######################\nOutput:",
