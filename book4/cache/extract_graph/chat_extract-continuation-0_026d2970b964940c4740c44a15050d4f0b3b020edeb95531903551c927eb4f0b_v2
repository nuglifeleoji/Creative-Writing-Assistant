\n　　吊针的玻璃管内，精盐水静无声息地嘀嗒着。此刻这里没有护士，一切都静静的。她听见自己的心象鼓声一般“咚咚”地跳着。 \n　　她走过去，悄悄地坐在病床边的小凳上。 \n　　突然，她发现他眼角里滑出了两颗泪珠！ \n　　他醒着！ \n　　她犹豫了一下，便掏出自己的手帕，把那两颗泪珠轻轻揩掉。于是，他睁开了眼睛……你奇怪吗？不要奇怪。我是我。我是来照看你的。我将要守在你的床边，侍候你，让你安心养伤。你不要闭住眼睛！你看着我！我希望你能很快明白，我是回到你身边来了，而且不会再离开…… \n　　当李向前睁开眼睛，看见为他揩泪的不是护士而竟然是润叶的时候，那神态猛然间变得象受了委屈的孩子重新得到妈妈的抚爱，闭住自己的眼睛只管让泪水象溪流似的涌淌。这一刻里，他似乎忘记了一切，包括他失去了的双腿。他只感到自己象躺在一片轻柔的云彩里，悠悠地飘浮着。 \n　　噢，亲爱的人！你终于听见了我心灵的不息的呼唤……润叶一边用手帕为他揩泪水，一边轻声安慰他说：“不要难过。灾难既然发生了，就按发生了来。等伤好了，过几个月就给你安假肢……” \n　　这些平常的安慰话在向前听来，就象天使的声音。他紧闭双眼，静默无语。但他内心却象狂潮一般翻腾。他直到现在还难以相信，坐在他床边的就是使他备受折磨，梦寐以求的那个人！ \n　　可这的确是她。 \n　　你感到幸福吗，他在内心中问自己。 \n　　不！这幸福又有什么用！他的一切都毁掉了，还有什么幸福可言！说不定她也是来尽最后的人情义务和一个临终的人来决别…… \n　　不过，我亲爱的人，仅此一点，我也就心满意足了。你来了，这很好。我多年来为你而付出的沉重代价，你多少已给了我一个补偿。在我要离开这个世界的时候，最后那个句号总算比较圆…… \n　　他想起了高中课本上学过的《阿Ｑ正传》。可怜的阿Ｑ在死之前怎样费尽心机地也没把那个圆圈画圆。他比阿Ｑ强的是，他的“圆圈”总算让自己满意了。 \n　　“你一定要把思想放开朗。不要怕，我会尽心照顾你。一直照顾……不久前，行署家属楼上给咱们分了两间一套的房子。等你出了院，我就把你接回去……”润叶仍然在他耳朵边轻轻地说着。 \n　　这是她说的话吗？
