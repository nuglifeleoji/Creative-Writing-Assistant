\n　　在田家圪崂这面的大队部，以田福堂为首的几个人正进行闹秧歌的总料理。福堂已经披上了他那件狐皮领子大氅，戴上了栽绒火车头棉帽，布置接待外村秧歌队的具体事宜。聚在这里的除过福堂，再没有队里的其他领导，而是一些上了年纪的村民。在此种事上，这些穿戴齐整的老汉成了领导人和权威。几家秧歌队凑到一起，礼节如同国家元首互访一样繁多；稍不周到，就可能酿成战争。因此这些威严的老者象美国联帮法院的最高法官，随时准备负责仲裁和解释“法规”。 \n　　在庙坪枣林前面的一个大空场地上，金俊山、孙少安、金俊武、田福高和金光亮等人正负责栽灯。地上摆满了高梁杆和萝卜做成的灯盏。 \n　　最大的人群中心在金家湾那面的小学院子里——大秧歌队正在这里排练。全村所有闹秧歌的人才和把式都集中在这地方。婆姨女子，穿戴得花红柳绿；老汉后生，打扮得齐齐整整。秧歌队男女两排，妇女一律粉袄绿裤，长彩带缠腰，手着扇子两把；男人统一上黑下蓝，头上包着白羊肚子毛巾。随着锣鼓点，这些人就满院子翩翩起舞。伞头当然是田五，此人唱秧歌闻名全原西县，五十年代还去黄原参加过汇演；他出口成章，妙语连珠，常常使众人大饱耳福。但石圪节其它村庄与他相匹敌的伞头也不乏其人。伞头极其重要，往往能反映一个村的秧歌水平。 \n　　此刻，在小学的教室里，另外一些人正在排练小戏。演员有少平、金成、姚淑芳、润生、银花、海民、金富、金强、田平娃、兰香、金秀等人。金波已从黄原赶回来，正负责“五音”班子。金波笛子、二胡、手风琴都能来。孙玉亭和金光辉吹管子；光辉他二哥金光明拉板胡。小戏算是“阳春白雪”，大秧歌完了，就看这些节日撑台呢。 \n　　这时候，我们的玉亭同志也临时放弃了阶级立场，和地主的两个儿子坐在了一条板凳上闹“五音”。排戏休息的时候，大队会计田海民嬉笑着对孙玉亭说：“玉亭叔，你的头发以后再不用我理了吧？” \n　　这句话逗得众人哄堂大笑。原来，这话里有话：不久前，王彩娥在她妈的主持下，改嫁到了石圪节，和胖理发师胡得禄结婚了。 \n　　在大家的哄笑声中，金富两兄弟和孙家的人都十分难堪。 \n　　好在这种红火时候；人们�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>双水村<|>GEO<|>双水村 is a village where local residents are engaged in traditional
