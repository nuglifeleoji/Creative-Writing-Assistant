季玉虽善，其臣刘璝、张任等皆有不平之色，其间吉凶未可保也。以统之计，莫若来日设宴，请季玉赴席；于壁衣中埋伏刀斧手一百人，主公掷杯为号，就筵上杀之；一拥入成都，刀不出鞘，弓不上弦，可坐而定也。”玄德曰：“季玉是吾同宗，诚心待吾；更兼吾初到蜀中，恩信未立；若行此事，上天不容，下民亦怨。公此谋，虽霸者亦不为也。”统曰：“此非统之谋，是法孝直得张松密书，言事不宜迟，只在早晚当图之。”言未已，法正入见，曰：“某等非为自己，乃顺天命也。”玄德曰：“刘季玉与吾同宗，不忍取之。”正曰：“明公差矣。若不如此，张鲁与蜀有杀母之仇，必来攻取。明公远涉山川，驱驰士马，既到此地，进则有功，退则无益。若执狐疑之心，迁延日久，大为失计。且恐机谋一泄，反为他人所算。不若乘此天与人归之时，出其不意，早立基业，实为上策。”庞统亦再三相劝。正是：人主几番存厚道，才臣一意进权谋。未知玄德心下如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第六十一回
