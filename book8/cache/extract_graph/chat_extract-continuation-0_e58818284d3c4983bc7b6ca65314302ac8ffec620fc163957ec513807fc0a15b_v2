：“上次我好像也感觉到了，应该是一种不逊色于我的黄金狮王的武魂。我在发出黄金狮子吼之后，正处于虚弱状态，被他趁机控制，所以才导致我们输了。但从他当时的情况来看，他应该也只能发出一次那样的怒吼。”\n\n    说到这里，他眼中光芒闪烁：“这次不一样了。我现在已经是二环大魂师，拥有了两个魂技，无论如何，他都不可能再战胜我们。”\n\n    “还有一点。”常剑逸继续说道。\n\n    “嗯？”吕千寻看向他。\n\n    常剑逸道：“你们有没有觉得，自从蓝轩宇加入到三三三寝室之后，钱磊和刘锋也变得不一样了?上次我们输给他们，固然是因为蓝轩宇，但和刘锋也有很大关系。\n\n    以他原本的战斗力，就算他速度非常快，按说应该也不能直接贯穿我的身体，将我一下重创。\n\n    可那天他做到了。包括后来击杀你们的两枪，还有破开金翔的烈金翅防御时发出的攻击，都要比他在一般情况下强得多。好像蓝轩宇那一吼，让他也变强了。\n\n    “而钱磊上次召唤出的那个女孩虽然只是昙花一现，却挡住了班长你的攻击，不知道是不是偶然。”\n\n    常剑逸的洞察力非常强，这一点吕千寻也是佩服的，听他这么一说，眉头顿时微微皱起。\n\n    常剑逸接着道：“所以，关键还是在蓝轩宇身上，正是因为有了他的存在，三三三寝室才整体变强了。虽然不知道为什么会这样，但我们在战术上必须要做出一些有针对性的安排。如果我们碰上他们，那么，一定要以雷霆万钧之势，不惜代价地先击败蓝轩宇。只要没有了他，钱磊和刘锋不足为惧。”\n\n    吕千寻和叶灵瞳对视一眼，不约而同地点了点头。\n\n    下午考核，是证明自己的时候了。无论如何，这次他们都要获得冠军，重新夺回全班第一小组的荣誉。\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百一十六章 擂台\n\n    “下午实战考核的场景是，擂台！”牧重天眼含深意的看着学员们说道。\n\n    听到擂台这两个字，很多人甚至都有松了口气的感觉。\n\n    擂台意味着什么？当面锣对面鼓的硬碰硬战斗，比拼的是真正的战斗实力，远不像上次迷宫那样，有那么多的不确定性。\n\n    也就是说，在擂台的比拼下，那就是谁强，谁就能够获得更好的成绩。运气、智慧的作用相对来说就会小很多。\n\n    “具体的考核规则如下。鉴于上一次期中考试考核中，三三三寝室的优秀表现。所以，本次考核，由三三三寝室的三名同学作为擂主。其他各组，抽签进行攻擂。全部考核将分为九场。也就是说，三三三寝室的三位同学将进行九场战斗。每一场战斗之后，模拟舱将恢复他们的实力，一切重新开始。我们\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
