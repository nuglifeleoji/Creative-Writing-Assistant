石神在清洲桥前走上台阶。要去高中，必须在这里过桥，不过他却朝反方向走去。\n    面向马路，有个店面挂着“天亭”的招牌，是间小小的便当店。石神打开玻璃门。\n    “欢迎光临，您早。”柜台后面，传来石神听惯的、却总是能为他带来新鲜气氛的声音。戴着白帽的花冈靖子笑颜如花。\n    店内没有别的客人，这点让他更加欣欣然。\n    “呃，招牌便当……”\n    “好，招牌一份。谢谢您每次惠顾。”\n    她用开朗的声音说着，但石神不知道她脸上是什么表情。因为他不敢正视她，一直低头瞧着皮夹里面。虽然他也想过既然有缘住在隔壁，除了买便当应该聊点别的，但实在想不出任何话题。\n    付钱的时候他总算试着挤出一句“天气真冷”，但他含糊吞吐的嘟囔声，被随后进来的客人拉开玻璃门的声音盖过去了。靖子的注意力似乎也已转移到那边。\n    拿着便当，石神走出店，这次终于走向清洲桥。他特地绕远路的原因，就是为了“天亭”。\n    过了早上的通勤时间“天亭”就闲下来了，不过这只是表示暂时没有客人上门。实际上，店后面正在要开始准备午餐。有几家公司跟店里签约，必须在十二点之前把便当送到。没客人上门时，靖子也得去厨房帮忙。\n    “天亭”包括靖子在内共有四名员工。掌厨的是身为老板的米泽，和他的妻子小代子。打工的金子负责外送便当，店内的贩卖的工作几乎全交给靖子一个人。\n    做这份工作前，靖子在锦系町的酒廊上班，米泽是常去喝酒的客人之一。直到店里雇用的妈妈桑小代子离职前夕，靖子才知道小代子原来是他的妻子，是当事人亲口说的。\n    “酒家的妈妈桑居然变成了便当店老板娘。人那，还真是说不准。”客人们这么议论着。不过据小代子表示，开便利店是他们夫妻多年的梦想，她就是为了实现梦想才去酒家上班云云。\n    “天亭”开张后，靖子也不时去探望，店里似乎经营得很顺利。就在开店整整一年后，夫妻俩向她提议，问她能不能去店里帮忙。因为光靠夫妻俩打点一切，无论就体力和客观环境上来说都太过勉强。\n    “靖子你自己，也不可能永远干陪酒那一行吧？美里也大了，对于母亲陪酒，也差不多会开始自卑了。”\n    当然这也许只是我鸡婆啦-----小代子又补上这么一句。\n    美里是靖子的独生女。没有父亲，她和丈夫早在五年前就离婚了。用不着小代子说，靖子也想过这样不\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
