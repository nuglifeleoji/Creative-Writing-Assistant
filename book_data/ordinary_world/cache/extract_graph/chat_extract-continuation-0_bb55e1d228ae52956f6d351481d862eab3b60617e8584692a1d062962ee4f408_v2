声音呼叫孩子回家睡觉。东拉河水声朗朗，吟唱着那支永不疲倦的歌……孙少安已不再和弟弟争辨。他伤感地对少平说：“那你看着办吧，你已经长大成人了，我……”他感到语塞，竟不知说什么了。 \n　　这时候，孙少平的心情也沉重起来了。他对哥哥说：“我走了，你和爸爸的负担就更重了……” \n　　少安轻轻叹了一口气，说：“既然你一心要出去，也就不要牵挂家里，你自己一个人在外面，无依无靠，倒要好好操心哩！家里的事你放心，有我哩……” \n　　黑暗中，两团泪水涌满了少平的双眼……几天以后，少平就决定走黄原了。 \n　　母亲流着泪为他把那点破被褥拆洗了一遍，少安从手头挤出五十元钱，硬往弟弟手里塞——少平只接了十五元；他知道家里现在需要钱，他不愿拿这么多；再说，既然他要出门，就得靠自己的双手去谋生了！ \n　　临走的前一天晚上，他打捆好了自己的行李。一条开洞的黑羊毛毡；被褥是早年间姐姐出嫁后留下的，已经缀了许多补钉——三根断麻绳续在一起，便扎住了这出门的全部行囊。 \n　　晚上，他和衣躺在土炕上，一直半睡半醒。明天他就要走了，走向一个前途未卜的世界，他现在才感到了一片令人心悸的渺茫，由不得手心里捏出两把汗水……睡梦中，他感觉有人轻轻地摩挲他的头发，他知道这是父亲的手。他一直等汹涌的泪水通过鼻孔管流进肚子里，才睁开眼睛。 \n　　父亲立在炕边，手里拿着当年他上学时用过的那个烂黄提包。说：“我出去叫田海民把坏的拉链修好了。海民说，以后用的时候，拿肥皂擦一擦……” \n　　他克制着哽咽，对父亲说：“嗯……” \n　　第二天早晨，从米家镇开往黄原的第一辆长途汽车过来后，挤在公路边上为少平送行的全家人，都举起胳膊拦挡车。 \n　　车一停住，少平就立刻提起那卷破烂行李挤了上去。他尽量笑着挥手向亲人们告别。而并不知道两颗泪珠早已从他的脸颊上滑落下来…… \n                  第12章\n　　黄原城是一座古老的城市。据清嘉庆七年版《黄原府记》称，其历史可追溯至周（古为白狄族所居住）。周以后，历代曾分别在这里设郡、州、府，既是屯兵御敌之重镇，又是黄土高原一个重要的物资集散地。现在作为地区首府，管辖着黄原市和周围十五个县，其版图如地委书记苗凯所说：等于一个阿尔巴尼亚。 \n　　该城座落在一个大川道里，四周被连绵的群山包围。黄原河由北向南穿城而\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a character who expresses concern for
