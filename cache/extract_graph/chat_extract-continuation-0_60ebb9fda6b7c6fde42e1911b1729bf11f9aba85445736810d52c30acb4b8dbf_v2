Two big ones had been heard nearby in the night. Melange, even at modern deflated prices, could buy the glazed bricks to line a third windtrap.\nEach searching child not only looked for the spice but also sought those signs which would reveal one of the old Fremen sietch strongholds. There were only remnants of such places now but the rock barriers provided a greater\nsecurity against Shaitan. And some of the remnant sietch places were reputed to contain lost hoards of melange. Every villager dreamed of such a discovery.\nSheeana, wearing her patched stillsuit and flimsy robe, went alone to the northeast, toward the faraway smoky mound of air that told of the great city of Keen with its moisture richness lifting into the sun-warmed breezes.\nHunting scraps of melange in the sand was largely a matter of focusing attention into the nostrils. It was a form of concentration that left only bits of awareness attuned to the rasping sand that told of Shaitan’s approach. Leg muscles moved automatically in the non-rhythmic walk that blended with the desert’s natural sounds.\nAt first, Sheeana did not hear the screaming. It fitted intimately into the saltated friction of windblown sand across the barracans that concealed the village from her sight. Slowly the sound penetrated her consciousness and then it demanded her attention.\nMany voices screaming!\nSheeana discarded the desert precaution of random strides. Moving swiftly as her childish muscles would carry her, she scrambled up the slipface of the barracan and stared along it toward that terrifying sound. She was in time to see that which cut off the last of the screams.\nWind and sandtrout had dried a wide arc of the barrier at the far side of her village. She could see the gap by the color difference. A wild worm had penetrated the opening. It circled close inside the remaining dampness. The gigantic flame-shadowed mouth scooped up people and hovels ina swiftly tightening circle.\nSheeana saw the last survivors huddled at the center of this destruction, a space already cleared of its rude hovels and tumbled with the remains of the windtraps. Even as she watched, some of the people tried to break away into the desert. Sheeana recognized her father among the frantic\nrunners. None escaped. The great mouth engulfed all before turning to level the last of the village.\nSmoking sand remained and nothing else of the puny village that had dared to claim a scrap of Shaitan’s domain. The place where the village had been was as unmarked by human habitation as it had been before anyone walked there.\nSheeana took a gasping breath, inhaling through her nose to preserve the moisture of her body as any good child of the desert would do. She scanned the horizon for a sign of the other children but Shaitan’s track had left great curves and loops all around the far side of the village. Not a single human remained in view. She shouted, the high-pitched cry that would carry far through the dry air. No response came back to her.\nAlone.\nShe moved trancelike along the ridge of the dune toward where her village had been. As she neared the place a great wave of cinnamon odor filled her nostrils, carried on the wind that still dusted the tops of the dunes. She realized then what had happened. The village had been sited disastrously atop a pre-spice blow. As the great hoard far under the sand came to fruition, expanding in an explosion of melange, Shaitan had come. Every child knew Shaitan could not resist a spiceblow.\nRage and wild desperation began to fill Sheeana. Mindlessly, she raced down the dune toward Shaitan, coming up behind the worm as it turned back through the dry place where it had entered the village. Without thought, she dashed along beside the tail, scrambled onto it and ran forward along the great ridged back. At the hump behind its mouth, she crouched and beat her fists against the unyielding surface.\nThe worm stopped.\nHer anger suddenly converted to terror, Sheeana broke off pounding on the worm. She realized only then that she\nhad been screaming. A terrible sense of lonely exposure filled her. She did not Know how she had come here. She knew only where she was and this gripped her with an agony of fear.\nThe worm continued quiescent on the sand.\nSheeana did not know what to do. At any moment, the worm could roll over and crush her. Or it could burrow beneath the sand, leaving her on the surface to be scooped up at leisure.\nAbruptly, a long tremor worked its way down the worm’s length from its tail to Sheeana’s position behind the mouth. The worm began to move ahead. It turned in a wide arc and gathered speed on a course to the northeast.\nSheeana leaned forward and gripped the leading edge of a ring ridge on the worm’s back. She feared that any second it would slide beneath the sand. What could she do then? But Shaitan did not burrow. As minutes passed without any deviation from that straight and swift passage across the dunes, Sheeana found her mind working once more. She knew about this ride. The priests of the Divided God forbade it but the histories, both written and oral, said Fremen rode thus in the ancient days. Fremen stood tall atop Shaitan’s back supported by slender poles with hooked ends. The priests decreed that this had been done before Leto II shared His consciousness with the God of the desert. Now, nothing was permitted that might demean the scattered bits of Leto Il.\nWith a speed that astonished her, the worm carried Sheeana toward the mist-dazzled shape of Keen. The great city lay like a mirage on the distorted horizon. Sheeana’s threadbare robe whipped against the thin surface of her patched stillsuit. Her fingers ached where she gripped the leading edge of the giant ring. The cinnamon, burnt-rock and ozone of the worm’s heat exchange swept over her on Shifts in the wind.\nKeen began to gain definition ahead of her.\nThe priests will see me and be angry, she thought.\nShe identified the low brick structures that marked the first line of qanats and, beyond them, the enclosed barrel- curve of a surface aqueduct. Above these structures rose the walls of terraced gardens and the high profiles of giant windtraps, then the temple complex within its own water barriers.\nA day’s march across open sand in little more than an hour!\nHer parents and village neighbors had made this journey many times for trade and to join in the dancing but Sheeana had only accompanied them twice. She remembered mostly the dancing and the violence that followed. The size of Keen filled her with awe. So many buildings! So many people! Shaitan could not harm such a place as that.\nBut the worm plunged straight ahead as though it would ride over qanat and aqueduct. Sheeana stared at the city rising higher and higher in front of her. Fascination subdued her terror. Shaitan was not going to stop!\nThe worm ground to a halt.\nThe tubular surface vents of the qanat lay no more than fifty meters in front of its gaping mouth. She smelled the hot cinnamon exhalations, heard the deep rumblings of Shaitan’s interior furnace.\nIt became apparent to her at last that the journey had ended. Slowly, Sheeana released her grip on the ring. She stood, expecting any moment the worm would renew its motion. Shaitan remained quiescent. Moving cautiously, she Slid off her perch and dropped to the sand. She paused there. Would it move now? She held a vague idea of dashing for the qanat but this worm fascinated her. Slipping and Sliding in the disturbed sand, Sheeana moved around to the front of the worm and stared into the fearsome mouth. Within the frame of crystal teeth flames rolled forward and backward. A searing exhalation of spice odors swept over her.\nThe madness of that first dash down off the dune and onto the worm came back to Sheeana. “Damn you, Shaitan!” she shouted, shaking a fist at the awful mouth. “What did we ever do to you?”\nThese were words she had heard her mother use at the destruction of a tuber garden. No part of Sheeana’s awareness had ever questioned that name, Shaitan, nor her mother’s fury. She was of the poorest dregs at the bottom of the Rakian heap and she knew it. Her people believed in Shaitan first and Shai-hulud second. Worms were worms and often much worse. There was no justice on the open sand. Only danger lurked there. Poverty and fear of priests might drive her people onto the perilous dunes but they moved even then with the same angry persistence that had driven the Fremen.\nThis time, however, Shaitan had won.\nIt entered Sheeana’s awareness that she stood in the deadly path. Her thoughts, not yet fully formed, recognized only that she had done a crazy thing. Much later, as the Sisterhood’s teachings rounded her consciousness, she would realize that she had been overcome by the terror of loneliness. She had wanted Shaitan to take her into the company of her dead.\nA grating sound issued from beneath the worm.\nSheeana stifled a scream.\nSlowly at first, then faster, the worm backed off several meters. It turned there and gathered speed beside the twin- mounded track it had created coming from the desert. The grating of its passage diminished in the distance. Sheeana grew aware of another sound. She lifted her gaze to the sky. The thwock-thwock of a priestly ornithopter swept over her, brushing her with its shadow. The craft glistened in the morning sunlight as it followed the worm into the desert.\nSheeana felt a more familiar fear then.\nThe priests!\nShe kept her gaze on the 'thopter. It hovered in the distance, then returned to settle gently onto a patch of worm-smoothed sand nearby. She could smell the lubricants and the sickly acridity of the 'thopter’s fuel. The thing was a giant insect nestled on the sand, waiting to pounce upon her.\nA hatch popped open.\nSheeana threw back her shoulders and stood her ground. Very well; they had caught her. She knew what to expect now. Nothing could be gained by flight. Only the priests used ‘thopters. They could go anywhere and see anything.\nTwo richly robed priests, their garments all gold and white with purple trim, emerged and ran toward her across the sand. They knelt in front of Sheeana so close she could smell their perspiration and the musky melange incense which permeated their clothing. They were young but much like all the priests she could remember: soft of features, uncalloused hands, careless of their moisture losses. Neither of them wore a stillsuit under those robes.\nThe one on her left, his eyes on a level with Sheeana’s, spoke.\n“Child of Shai-hulud, we saw your Father bring you from His lands.”\nThe words made no sense to Sheeana. Priests were men to be feared. Her parents and all the adults she had ever known had impressed this upon her by words and actions.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young girl from a desert village who survives a worm attack and rides a sandworm to the city of Keen, displaying bravery and resourcefulness.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIATAN<|>PERSON<|>Shaitan is the name given to the sandworms by the villagers, feared as destructive and unpredictable creatures.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEEN<|>GEO<|>Keen is a great city with terraced gardens, windtraps, and a temple complex, representing wealth and safety compared to the desert villages.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>PERSON<|>The Fremen are an ancient people who once lived in the desert and rode sandworms, now only remnants of their culture remain.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIESTS OF THE DIVIDED GOD<|>PERSON<|>The priests are religious figures who enforce rules and traditions, including prohibitions against riding sandworms.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>A prison in Tiruzia where hostages were held.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELANGE<|>EVENT<|>Melange is a valuable spice found in the desert, sought after by villagers for trade and survival.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICEBLOW<|>EVENT<|>A spiceblow is an explosion of melange that attracts sandworms, leading to destruction.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>SHIATAN<|>Sheeana rides Shaitan to Keen after her village is destroyed by the worm<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>KEEN<|>Sheeana is brought to Keen by Shaitan, where she faces the priests<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PRIESTS OF THE DIVIDED GOD<|>The priests intercept Sheeana after her ride on Shaitan<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHIATAN<|>MELANGE<|>Shaitan is attracted to spiceblows where melange is present<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHIATAN<|>SPICEBLOW<|>Shaitan destroys Sheeana's village because it was built atop a pre-spice blow<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>SHIATAN<|>The Fremen historically rode sandworms like Shaitan<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRIESTS OF THE DIVIDED GOD<|>FREMEN<|>The priests forbid practices like worm-riding that were once common among the Fremen<|>5\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
