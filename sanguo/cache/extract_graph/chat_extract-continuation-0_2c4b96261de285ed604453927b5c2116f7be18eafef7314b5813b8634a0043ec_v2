操既定大事，乃设宴后堂，聚众谋士共议曰：“刘备屯兵徐州，自领州事；近吕布以兵败投之，备使居于小沛：若二人同心引兵来犯，乃心腹之患也。公等有何妙计可图之？”许褚曰：“愿借精兵五万，斩刘备、吕布之头，献于丞相。”荀彧曰：“将军勇则勇矣，不知用谋。今许都新定，未可造次用兵。彧有一计，名曰二虎竞食之计。今刘备虽领徐州，未得诏命。明公可奏请诏命实授备为徐州牧，因密与一书，教杀吕布。事成则备无猛士为辅，亦渐可图；事不成，则吕布必杀备矣：此乃二虎竞食之计也。”操从其言，即时奏请诏命，遣使赍往徐州，封刘备为征东将军宜城亭侯领徐州牧；并附密书一封。却说刘玄德在徐州，闻帝幸许都，正欲上表庆贺。忽报天使至，出郭迎接入郡，拜受恩命毕，设宴管待来使。使曰：“君侯得此恩命，实曹将军于帝前保荐之力也。”玄德称谢。使者乃取出私书递与玄德。玄德看罢，曰：“此事尚容计议。”席散，安歇来使于馆驿。玄德连夜与众商议此事。张飞曰：“吕布本无义之人，杀之何碍！”玄德曰：“他势穷而来投我，我若杀之，亦是不义。”张飞曰：“好人难做！”玄德不从。次日，吕布来贺，玄德教请入见。布曰：“闻公受朝廷恩命，特来相贺。”玄德逊谢。只见张飞扯剑上厅，要杀吕布。玄德慌忙阻住。布大惊曰：“翼德何故只要杀我？”张飞叫曰：“曹操道你是无义之人，教我哥哥杀你！”玄德连声喝退。乃引吕布同入后堂，实告前因；就将曹操所送密书与吕布看。布看毕，泣曰：“此乃曹贼欲令我二人不和耳！”玄德曰：“兄勿忧，刘备誓不为此不义之事。”吕布再三拜谢。备留布饮酒，至晚方回。关、张曰：“兄长何故不杀吕布？”玄德曰：“此曹孟德恐我与吕布同谋伐之，故用此计，使我两人自相吞并，彼却于中取利。奈何为所使乎？”关公点头道是。张飞曰：“我只要杀此贼以绝后患！”玄德曰：“此非大丈夫之所为也。”\n\n
