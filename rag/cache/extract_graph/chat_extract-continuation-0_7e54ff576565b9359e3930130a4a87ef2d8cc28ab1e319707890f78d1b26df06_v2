It says: ‘We share the same burden. Sand is our only enemy. This is what we drink. The hand that holds sand holds no weapon.’ Do you understand this?”\n“No!” She taunted him with a defiant falsehood.\n“You will,” he said.\nWithout a word, she set out along the arc of their dune, striding away from him with an angry excess of energy. Leto allowed himself to fall far behind her, interested that she had instinctively chosen the right direction. Fremen memories could be felt churning in her.\nWhere the dune dipped to cross another, she waited for him. He saw that the face flap of her stillsuit remained open,\nhanging loose. It was not yet time to chide her about this. Some unconscious things had to run their natural course.\nAs he came up to her, she said: “Is this as good a direction as any other?”\n“If you keep to it,” he said.\nShe glanced up at the stars and he saw her identify the Pointers, those Fremen Arrows which had led her ancestors across this land. He could see, though, that her recognition was mostly intellectual. She had not yet come to accept the other things working within her.\nLeto lifted his front segments to peer ahead in the starlight. They were moving a little west of north on a track that once had led across Habbanya Ridge and Cave of Birds into the erg below False Wall West and the way to Wind Pass. None of those landmarks remained. He sniffed a cool breeze with flint smells in it and more moisture than he found pleasant.\nOnce more, Siona set off—slower this time, holding her course by occasional glances at the stars. She had trusted Leto to confirm the way, but now she guided herself. He sensed the turmoil beneath her wary thoughts, and he knew the things which were emerging. She had the beginnings of that intense loyalty to traveling companions which desert folk always trusted.\nWe know, he thought. /f you are separated from your companions, you are lost among dunes and rocks. The lone traveler in the desert is dead. Only the worm lives alone out here.\nHe let her get well ahead of him where the grating sand of his passage would not be too prominent. She had to think of his human-self. He counted on loyalty to work for him. Siona was brittle, though, filled with suppressed rage—more of a rebel than any other he had ever tested.\nLeto glided along behind her, reviewing the breeding program, shaping the necessary decisions for a replacement should she fail.\nAs the night progressed, Siona moved slower and slower. First Moon was high overhead and Second Moon well above the horizon before she stopped to rest and eat.\nLeto was glad of the pause. Friction had set up a worm- dominance, the air around him full of the chemical exhalations from his temperature adjustments. The thing he thought of as his oxygen supercharger vented steadily, making him intensely aware of the protein factories and amino acid resources his worm-self had acquired to accommodate the placental relationship with his human cells. Desert quickened the movement toward his final metamorphosis.\nSiona had stopped near the crest of a star dune. “Is it true that you eat the sand?” she asked as he came up to her.\n“It’s true.”\nShe stared all around the moon-frosted horizon. “Why didn’t we bring a signal device?”\n“I wanted you to learn about possessions.”\nShe turned toward him. He sensed her breath close to his face. She was losing too much moisture into the dry air. Still, she did not remember Moneo’s admonition. It would be a bitter lesson, no doubt of that.\n“| don’t understand you at all,” she said.\n“Yet, you are committed to doing just that.”\n“Am I?”\n“How else can you give me something of value in exchange for what | give you?”\n“What do you give me?” All of the bitterness was there and a hint of the spice from her dried food.\n“I give you this opportunity to be alone with me, to share with me, and you spend this time without concern. You waste it.”\n“What about possessions?” she demanded.\nHe heard fatigue in her voice, the water message beginning to scream within her.\n“They were magnificently alive in the old days, those Fremen,” he said. “And their eye for beauty was limited to that which was useful. | never met a greedy Fremen.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n“In the old days, everything you took into the desert was a necessity and that was all you took. Your life is no longer free of possessions, Siona, or you would not have asked about a signal device.”\n“Why isn’t a signal device necessary?”\n“It would teach you nothing.”\nHe moved out around her along the track indicated by the Pointers. “Come. Let us use this night to our profit.”\nShe came hurrying up to walk beside his cowled face. “What happens if | don’t learn your damned lesson?”\n“You'll probably die,” he said.\nThat silenced her for a time. She trudged along beside him with only an occasional sideward glance, ignoring the worm-body, concentrating on the visible remnants of his humanity. After a time, she said: “The Fish Speakers told me that you ordered the mating from which | was born.”\n“That’s true.”\n“They say you keep records and that you order these Atreides matings for your own purposes.”\n“That also is true.”\n“Then the Oral History is correct.”\n“I thought you believed the Oral History without question?”\nShe was on a single track, though: “What if one of us objects when you order a mating?”\n“I allow a wide latitude just as long as there are the children | have ordered.”\n“Ordered?” She was outraged.\n“That’s what I do.”\n“You can’t creep into every bedroom or follow every one of us every minute of our lives! How do you know your orders are obeyed?”\n“I know.”\n“Then you know I’m not going to obey you!”\n“Are you thirsty, Siona?”\nShe was startled. “What?”\n“Thirsty people speak of water, not of sex.”\nStill, she did not seal her mouth flap, and he thought: Atreides passions always did run strong, even at the expense of reason.\nWithin two hours, they came down out of the dunes onto a wind-scoured flat of pebbles. Leto moved onto it, Siona close to his side. She looked frequently at the Pointers. Both moons were low on the horizon now and their light cast long Shadows behind every boulder.\nIn some ways, Leto found such places more comfortable to traverse than the sand. Solid rock was a better heat conductor than sand. He could flatten himself against the rock and ease the working of his chemical factories. Pebbles and even sizable rocks did not impede him.\nSiona had more trouble here, though, and almost turned an ankle several times.\nThe flatland could be a very trying place for humans unaccustomed to it, he thought. If they stayed close to the ground, they saw only the great emptiness, an eerie place especially in moonlight—dunes at a distance, a distance which seemed not to change as the traveler moved— nothing anywhere except the seemingly eternal wind, a few rocks and, when they looked upward, stars without mercy. This was the desert of the desert.\n“Here’s where Fremen music acquired its eternal loneliness,” he said, “not up on the dunes. Here’s where you really learn to think that heaven must be the sound of running water and relief—any relief—from that endless wind.”\nEven this did not remind her of that face flap. Leto began to despair.\nMorning found them far out on the flat.\nLeto stopped beside three large boulders, all piled against each other, one of them taller even than his back. Siona leaned against him for a moment, a gesture which restored Leto’s hopes somewhat. She pushed herself away presently and clambered up onto the highest boulder. He watched her turn up there, examining the landscape.\nWithout even looking at it Leto knew what she saw: blowing sand like fog on the horizon obscured the rising sun. For the rest, there was only the flat and the wind.\nThe rock was cold beneath him with the chill of a desert morning. The cold made the air much drier and he found it more pleasant. Without Siona, he would have moved on, but she was visibly exhausted. She leaned against him once more when she came down from the rock and it was almost a minute before he realized that she was listening.\n“What do you hear?” he asked.\nShe spoke sleepily. “You rumble inside.”\n“The fire never goes completely out.”\nThis interested her. She pushed herself away from his side and came around to look into his face. “Fire?”\n“Every living thing has a fire within it, some slow, some very fast. Mine is hotter than most.”\nShe hugged herself against the chill. “Then you’re not cold here?”\n“No, but | can see that you are.” He pulled his face partly into its cowl and created a depression at the bottom arc of his first segment. “It’s almost like a hammock,” he said, looking down. “If you curl up there, you will be warm.”\nWithout hesitating, she accepted his invitation.\nEven though he had prepared her for it, he found the trusting response touching. He had to fight against a feeling of pity far stronger than any he had experienced before knowing Hwi. There could be no room for pity out here, though, he told himself. Siona was betraying clear signs that she would more than likely die here. He had to prepare himself for disappointment.\nSiona shielded her face with an arm, closed her eyes and went to sleep.\nNobody has ever had as many yesterdays as I have had, he reminded himself.\nFrom the popular human viewpoint, he knew that the things he did here could only appear cruel and callous. He was forced now to strengthen himself by retreating into his memories, deliberately selecting mistakes of our common past. First-hand access to human mistakes was his greatest strength now. Knowledge of mistakes taught him long-term corrections. He had to be constantly aware of consequences. If consequences were lost or concealed, lessons were lost.\nBut the closer he came to being a sandworm, the harder he found it to make decisions which others would call inhuman. Once, he had done it with ease. As his humanity slipped away, though, he found himself filled with more and more human concerns.\nIn the cradle of our past, | lay upon my back in a cave so shallow | could penetrate it only by squirming, not by crawling. There, by the dancing light of a resin torch, | drew upon walls and ceiling the creatures of the hunt and the souls of my people. How illuminating it is to peer backward through a perfect circle at that ancient struggle for the visible moment of the soul. All time vibrates to that call: “Here | am!” With a mind informed by artist- giants who came afterward, | peer at handprints and flowing muscles drawn upon the rock with charcoal and vegetable dyes. How much more we are than mere mechanical events! And my anticivil self demands: “Why is it that they do not want to leave the cave?”\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe invitation to attend Moneo in his workroom came to\nIdaho late in the afternoon. All day, Idaho had sat upon the sling couch of his quarters, thinking. Every thought radiated outward from the ease with which Moneo had spilled him onto the corridor floor that morning.\n“You're just an older model.”\nWith every thought, Idaho felt himself diminished\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a rebellious individual with Fremen heritage, undergoing a test in the desert with Leto, showing signs of defiance and fatigue.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a hybrid being with both human and sandworm traits, guiding Siona through the desert and testing her loyalty and survival skills.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>PERSON<|>The Fremen are desert-dwelling people with a rich cultural heritage, known for their survival skills and loyalty to companions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HABBIANYA RIDGE<|>GEO<|>A former landmark in the desert, now gone, once leading to other significant locations like the Cave of Birds and False Wall West.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAVE OF BIRDS<|>GEO<|>A historical location in the desert, now no longer existing, part of the old Fremen routes.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALSE WALL WEST<|>GEO<|>A former landmark in the desert, part of the old routes leading to Wind Pass.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIND PASS<|>GEO<|>A historical passage in the desert, now no longer existing.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group that communicates with Leto and is involved in the breeding program, providing information to Siona.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a figure who has admonished Siona, likely part of Leto's inner circle or the Fish Speakers.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI<|>PERSON<|>Hwi is a person Leto has known, who has influenced his feelings of pity and humanity.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Idaho is a character reflecting on his encounter with Moneo, feeling diminished by the experience.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>LETO<|>Siona is being tested by Leto in the desert, showing a mix of defiance and trust.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>FREMEN<|>Siona has Fremen heritage and memories, influencing her behavior and decisions.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FREMEN<|>Leto has deep knowledge of Fremen culture and uses it to guide and test Siona.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>HWI<|>Leto's relationship with Hwi has influenced his capacity for pity and human emotions.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>The Fish Speakers have informed Siona about Leto's breeding program and her origins.<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Leto works with the Fish Speakers to manage the breeding program and other activities.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>MONEO<|>Moneo has admonished Siona, likely about her behavior or survival in the desert.<|>3\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>MONEO<|>Idaho reflects on his encounter with Moneo, feeling diminished by the experience.<|>4\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
