A staunch opponent of the ghola project, she oversees the training and education of Duncan Idaho, often obstructing his quest for knowledge through harsh discipline, secrecy, and punitive measures, which fuels his hatred and fear of her. Schwangyu’s actions frequently clash with the plans of other key Bene Gesserit figures, particularly Taraza and Miles Teg, whom she openly opposes.  \n\nHer leadership is marked by suspicion and dissent; she monitors the ghola project closely, prepared to abort it at the first sign of trouble. Some accounts suggest she may have been subverted by the Bene Tleilaxu, forming a pact that led to an attack on Teg’s quarters. This alliance, along with her emotional instability and desperation, underscores her conflicting loyalties and possible complicity in violent schemes. Schwangyu’s distrust extends to Lucilla and Duncan, whom she views as threats, and she is implicated in the capture and likely death of Patrin for information extraction.  \n\nDespite her authority, Schwangyu’s predictability and opposition to Taraza’s agenda render her a liability within the Sisterhood. Her eventual death during an attack on the Keep leaves behind a cryptic message about her assailants, further complicating her legacy. While some portray her as a disciplined but overly rigid leader, others depict her as a traitorous figure whose actions destabilize Bene Gesserit operations. Ultimately, Schwangyu embodies the factional strife within the Sisterhood, representing both its authoritarian control and its vulnerabilities to betrayal.\",12\r\n954,PATRIN,\"**PATRIN** is a loyal and trusted aide, batman, and former comrade of **Bashar Miles Teg**, playing a pivotal role in multiple military and strategic operations. A native of **Gammu** and a seasoned soldier, Patrin is deeply involved in Teg's affairs, from managing training schedules—including that of **Duncan Idaho**—to overseeing operations at the **South Farm**. Despite his tactical expertise and leadership capabilities, he chooses to remain a squad leader, refusing formal rank despite being entitled to the pay and courtesies of a **colonel-aide**.  \n\nPatrin is instrumental in the defense against threats such as the **Face Dancers** and the **Tleilaxu**, meticulously following Teg's orders and contributing to escape plans. His most notable act of loyalty is his **self-sacrifice**—he detonates a decoy ship to mislead pursuers, ensuring the safety of Teg and his allies during the attack on the **Keep**. This act underscores his unwavering dedication.  \n\nEarlier in his life, Patrin discovered the **no-globe complex**, a hidden sanctuary on Gammu, which he kept secret. His relationship with Teg spans decades, symbolizing both Teg’s past and Duncan Idaho’s potential. Patrin also interacts directly with Duncan, conveying orders and assisting in his training. Described as a **fragile link**—a concept Teg trained him to recognize—Patrin’s death marks the end of a crucial but vulnerable connection in Teg’s network.  \n\nIn retirement, Patrin continues to serve Teg as a steadfast companion, embodying loyalty, tactical acumen, and self-sacrifice.
