These tribes, often characterized as \"barbarians\" by the Han Chinese, were known for their resistance against the expansionist efforts of the Shu Han state. The conflicts primarily arose as the Shu Han sought to consolidate its power and expand its territory into the southern regions, which were inhabited by these tribes.\n\nThe southern tribes, collectively known as 南蛮, were often led by their king, Meng Huo, who became a prominent figure in the resistance against Shu Han. Meng Huo's leadership was significant in uniting various tribes to oppose the incursions of Shu Han forces, showcasing the tribes' determination to maintain their autonomy and way of life. The interactions between the Shu Han and the 南蛮 were marked by a series of military confrontations, as well as attempts at negotiation and diplomacy.\n\nOverall, the 南蛮 represent a crucial aspect of the historical narrative during the Three Kingdoms period, illustrating the complexities of regional power dynamics and the struggles between established states and indigenous tribes. Their resistance not only highlights the challenges faced by the Shu Han but also reflects the broader themes of conflict and cultural interaction in ancient China.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898897, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
