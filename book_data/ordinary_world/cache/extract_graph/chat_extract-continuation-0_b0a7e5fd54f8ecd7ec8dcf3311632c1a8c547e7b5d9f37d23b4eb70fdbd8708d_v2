�么地方？如果已经离双水村不远的话，家里的人为什么还不快跑，坐在这儿哭什么哩？男人们现在都到哪里去了？能跑的赶快跑吧！她是跑不动了，她也活够寿数了，一枪打死正不要再受这活罪……啊啊！大概是家里的谁已经叫白军打死了，他们现在才不跑……谁哩？她在心里开始一个一个点家里的人；尽管许多原来的熟人她都忘了，但这些人她不会遗忘一个，家里在门外的人她算得来。玉厚？他早上不是还在家吃饭来着？玉亭？他已经超过当兵年龄了。那么，看来就是孙子中的谁发生了凶险！玉亭的三个女娃不会的；玉厚两个上学的还小，估计不会去打仗，他们还不到征兵年龄。那么看来，这必定是少安了。对了！这娃娃今天已经一天没见面了。天啊，昨天还在眼前，难道今天刚出去就上了火线？刚上火线就…… \n　　老太太一想到她的孙子被枪打死了，就在后炕上放开声哭了：“我那苦命的安安啊！我那没吃没喝的安安啊！我那还没活人的安安啊！叹——哟哟哟哟哟……” \n　　她看见前炕上兰花母子俩都扭过头对她说话，她虽听不见她们说什么，但她看出是让她不要哭了。鬼子孙们！安安死了，你哭，为什么不让我哭？你们亲他，难道我不亲他！她不管她们说什么，只管哭她死去的安安！ \n　　这时候，少平和兰香进了家门。看见他两个回来，除过老祖母继续哭外，兰花母女俩都先后停止了哭声。少平掏出在城里买的几块水果糖，塞在两个外甥手里，猫蛋和狗蛋高兴得赶忙就往嘴巴里塞。少平看了看脸上糊着泪痕的母亲和姐姐，说：“哭什么哩！事情出了就按出了的来！”兰香什么话也没说，悄悄提了个猪食桶，出去喂猪去了。懂事的孩子知道，家里这么大的事她帮不了什么忙，最好做点实际的事，好给烦乱的大人省些麻烦。她看见母亲和姐姐坐在炕上哭，知道猪还没喂——这口猪可是他们家的命根子呀！大哥每年开春都要借钱买只猪娃，一家大小相帮着喂到年底，肥得连走也走不动。过年家里从来没杀过猪；为了换个整钱，都是活卖了。这猪钱就是第二年全家人的“银行”，包括给她和她二哥交学费，买书和一些必需的学习用具。 \n　　兰香走后，少平才发现祖母还在哭，而且看见她一个劲用手势招呼他到她跟前来。 \n　　他赶紧上了炕，蹲在坐着的老祖母面前，准备把她从那一堆破烂被褥里扶起\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>双水村<|>GEO<|>双水村 is a
