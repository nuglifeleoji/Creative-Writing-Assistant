\n　　走到要回小学的那条巷口时，润叶突然说：“少安哥，你刚吃完饭，咱们到城外面去走一走。” \n　　少安不好拒绝她，但又觉得有些别扭。两个男女一块相跟着遛达，叫众人看着不美气。可又一想，这城周围又没人认识他，走一走就走一走，怕什么！他和润叶是一个村的老乡，又是老同学，这又有什么不可以的哩！ \n　　于是，他们就相跟着一块出了那座清朝年间修建的古老破败的东城口，又下了一个小土坡，来到了绕城而过的县河滩里。 \n　　初春解冻的原西河变得宽阔起来，浩浩荡荡的水流一片浑黄。在河对面见不到阳光的悬崖底下，还残留着一些蒙着灰尘的肮脏的冰溜子。但在那悬崖上面的小山湾里，桃花已经开得红艳艳的了。河岸边，鹅黄嫩绿的青草芽子从一片片去年的枯草中冒了出来，带给人一种盎然的生机。道路旁绿雾蒙蒙的柳行间，不时闪过燕子剪刀似的身姿。不知从什么地方的山野里，传来一阵女孩子的信天游歌声，飘飘荡荡，忽隐忽现—— \n　　正月里冻冰呀立春消，二月里鱼儿水儿水上漂，水呀上漂来想起我的哥！ \n　　想起我的哥哥， \n　　想起我的哥哥，想起我的哥哥呀你等一等我……少安和润叶相跟着，沿着原西河畔的一条小路，往河上游的方向走着。他们沉浸在明媚的春光中，心情无限地美妙。这倒使他们一时没有说什么话。 \n　　“你走慢一点嘛！我都撵不上你了！”润叶终于扬起脸对少安笑着说。 \n　　少安只好把自己的两条长腿放慢一点，说：“我山里洼里跑惯了，走得太慢急得不行。” \n　　“呀，你快看！”润叶指着前面的一个草坡，大声喊叫起来。 \n　　少安停住脚步，向她手指的地方望去。他什么也没看见。他奇怪地问：“什么？” \n　　“马兰花！看，蓝格莹莹的！” \n　　少安还以为是什么了不起的事哩。原来是几朵马兰花。这些野花野草他天天在山里看得多了，没什么稀罕的。润叶已经跑过去，坐在那几丛马兰花的旁边，等他过来。 \n　　他走到她身旁。她说：“咱们在这儿坐一会。” \n　　他只好坐下来，把两条胳膊帮在胸前，望着草坡下浑黄的原西河平静地流向远方。 \n　　润叶摘了一朵马兰花，在手里摆弄了半天，才吞吞吐吐说：“少安哥，我有个急人事，想对你说一说，让你看怎么�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>润叶<|>PERSON<|>润叶 is a character who suggests
