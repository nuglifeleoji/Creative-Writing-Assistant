\n　　“叔叔，请你把这钱交给金光明。那十几块手帕还让红梅拿走。请记住，她没有偷！这手帕是她买的！”少平把自己身上剩余的钱掏出来，一边往办公桌上放，一边对侯主任说。“我知道哩！这手帕不是偷的！”侯主任硬把钱往少平手里塞，大方地说：“啊呀，这怎能让你出钱呢！既然这女娃娃是你和玉英的同学，这钱让我出！” \n　　少平仍然把钱放下说：“就这样了。一会光明来了，把门打开，让红梅走。你几个不要过来，让我单独领她出去……” \n　　“那好，那好，”侯主任感叹地说：“你这年轻人心肠真好！啊呀，现在没这种年轻人了……我年轻的时候，也和你一样，门上来个讨饭的，尽管玉英她妈关住门不让进来，但我总要掰半个馍打发这些可怜人……” \n　　不一会，金光明来了。侯生才立刻把他拉到一边，在光明的耳朵边说了半天。金光明明白了。他走过来，亲热地在少平的肩胛上拍了拍，说：“人才！双水村的人才！” \n　　金光明很快领着少平去开他办公室的门。门打开后，光明按侯主任的指示，又转身回隔壁窑洞去了。 \n　　少平的心咚咚地狂跳着，走进了窑洞。他看见红梅瞪着一双哭红的眼睛，惊慌地看着他。 \n　　少平走到她跟前，说：“红梅，我把一切都处理好了。现在你走吧！” \n　　“什么？”红梅仍然惊慌地看着他，不知这个从天而降的同学怎样“处理好了”。她知道，她伤过这个人的心——他大概是乘她落井之时，幸灾乐祸地投石来了。但她根据两年的同学生活，又深知孙少平不是这样的人！ \n　　正在她胡盘算的时候，少平把前前后后的一切都给她说了。 \n　　红梅立刻如梦初醒，她就象死里逃生一般出声哭了起来。少平把桌上的“赃物”塞进她的书包，说：“别哭了。事情已经完结，赴快走吧！” \n　　红梅一边哭，一边赶紧拿起她的书包，跟着少平一溜烟似地就从门市后面出来了。 \n　　到街上的时候，少平对她说：“你先回去，我一个人慢�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
