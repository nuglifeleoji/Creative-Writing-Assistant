Teg wondered. There was no smell of the familiar narcotics around him, not even melange. There was a tart smell, though, almost like some fruit.\n“There you are, Solitz!” Muzzafar said. He gestured at Teg. “Give him a good scan. Stunner hit him day before yesterday.”\nSolitz produced a recognizable Suk scanner, compact and fitting into one hand. Its probe field produced a low hum.\n“So you’re a Suk doctor,” Teg said, looking pointedly at the orange brand on the forehead.\n“Yes, Bashar. My training and conditioning are the finest in our ancient tradition.”\n“I’ve never seen the identifying mark in that color,” Teg said.\nThe doctor passed his scanner around Teg’s head. “The color of the tattoo makes no difference, Bashar. What is behind it is all that matters.” He lowered the scanner to Teg’s shoulders, then down across the body.\nTeg waited for the humming to stop.\nThe doctor stood back and addressed Muzzafar: “He is quite fit, Field Marshal. Remarkably fit, considering his age, but he desperately needs sustenance.”\n“Yes... well, that’s fine then, Solitz. Take care of that. The Bashar is our guest.”\n“I will order a meal suited to his needs,” Solitz said. “Eat it slowly, Bashar.” Solitz did a smart about-face that set his jacket and trousers flapping. The tube slot swallowed him.\n“Field Marshal?” Teg asked.\n“A revival of ancient titles in the Dur,” Muzzafar said.\n“The Dur?” Teg ventured.\n“Stupid of me!” Muzzafar produced a small case from a side pocket of his jacket and extracted a thin folder. Teg recognized a holostat similar to one he had carried himself during his long service—pictures of home and family. Muzzafar placed the holostat on the table between them and tapped the control button.\nThe full-color image of a bushy green expanse of jungle came alive in miniature above the tabletop.\n“Home,” Muzzafar said. “Frame bush in the center there.” A finger indicated a place in the projection. “First one that ever obeyed me. People laughed at me for choosing the first one that way and sticking with it.”\nTeg stared at the projection, aware of a deep sadness in Muzzafar’s voice. The indicated bush was a spindly grouping of thin limbs with bright blue bulbs dangling from the tips.\nFrame bush?\n“Rather thin thing, | Know,” Muzzafar said, removing his pointing finger from the projection. “Not secure at all. Had to defend myself a few times in the first months with it. Grew rather fond of it, though. They respond to that, you know. It’s the best home in all the deep valleys now, by the Eternal Rock of Dur!”\nMuzzafar stared at Teg’s puzzled expression. “Damn! You don’t have frame bushes, of course. You must forgive my crashing ignorance. We've a great deal to teach each other, | think.”\n“You called that home,” Teg said.\n“Oh, yes. With proper direction, once they learn to obey, of course, a frame bush will grow itself into a magnificent residence. It only takes four or five standards.”\nStandards, Teg thought. So the Lost Ones still used the Standard Year.\nThe tube slot hissed and a young woman in a blue serving gown backed into the room towing a suspensor-buoyed\nhotpod, which she positioned near the table in front of Teg. Her clothing was of the type Teg had seen during his original inspection but the pleasantly round face she turned to him was unfamiliar. Her scalp had been depilated, leaving an expanse of prominent veins. Her eyes were watery blue and there was something cowed in her posture. She opened the hotpod and the spicy odors of the food wafted across Teg’s nostrils.\nTeg was alerted but he sensed no immediate threat. He could see himself eating the food without ill effect.\nThe young woman put a row of dishes on to the table in front of him and arranged the eating implements neatly at one side.\n“I’ve no snooper, but l'Il taste the foods if you wish,” Muzzafar said.\n“Not necessary,” Teg said. He knew this would raise questions but felt they would suspect him of being a Truthsayer. Teg’s gaze locked onto the food. Without any conscious decision, he leaned forward and began eating. Familiar with Mentat-hunger, he was surprised at his own reactions. Using the brain in Mentat mode consumed calories at an alarming rate, but this was a new necessity driving him. He felt his own survival controlling his actions. This hunger went beyond anything of previous experience. The soup he had eaten with some caution at the house of the ruined man had not aroused such a demanding reaction.\nThe Suk doctor chose correctly, Teg thought. This food had been selected directly out of the scanner’s summation.\nThe young woman kept bringing more dishes from hotpods ordered via the tube slot.\nTeg had to get up in the middle of the meal and relieve himself in an adjoining washroom, conscious there of the hidden comeyes that were keeping him under surveillance. He knew by his physical reactions that his digestive system had speeded up to a new level of bodily necessity. When he\nreturned to the table, he felt just as hungry as though he had not eaten.\nThe serving woman began to show signs of surprise and then alarm. Still, she kept bringing more food at his demand.\nMuzzafar watched with growing amazement but said nothing.\nTeg felt the supportive replacement of the food, the precise caloric adjustment that the Suk doctor had ordered. They obviously had not thought about quantity, though. The girl obeyed his demands in a kind of walking shock.\nMuzzafar spoke finally. “Must say I’ve never before seen anyone eat that much at one sitting. Can’t see how you do it. Nor why.”\nTeg sat back, satisfied at last, knowing he had aroused questions that could not be answered truthfully.\n“A Mentat thing,” Teg lied. “I’ve been through a very strenuous time.”\n“Amazing,” Muzzafar said. He arose.\nWhen Teg started to stand, Muzzafar gestured for him to remain. “No need. We’ve prepared quarters for you right next door. Safer not to move you yet.”\nThe young woman departed with the empty hotpods.\nTeg studied Muzzafar. Something had changed during the meal. Muzzafar watched him with a coldly measuring stare.\n“You’ve an implanted communicator,” Teg said. “You have received new orders.”\n“It would not be advisable for your friends to attack this place,” Muzzafar said.\n“You think that’s my plan?”\n“What is your plan, Bashar?”\nTeg smiled.\n“Very well.” Muzzafar’s gaze went out of focus as he listened to his communicator. When he once more concentrated on Teg, his gaze had the look of a predator. Teg felt himself buffeted by that gaze, recognizing that\nsomeone else was coming to this room. The Field Marshal thought of this new development as something extremely dangerous to his dinner guest but Teg saw nothing that could defeat his new abilities.\n“You think | am your prisoner,” Teg said.\n“By the Eternal Rock, Bashar! You are not what | expected!”\n“The Honored Matre who is coming, what does she expect?” Teg asked.\n“Bashar, | warn you: Do not take that tone with her. You have not the slightest concept of what is about to happen to you.”\n“An Honored Matre is about to happen to me,” Teg said.\n“And | wish you well of her!”\nMuzzafar pivoted and left via the tube slot.\nTeg stared after him. He could see the flickering of second vision like a light blinking around the tube slot. The Honored Matre was near but not yet ready to enter this room. First, she would consult with Muzzafar. The Field Marshal would not be able to tell this dangerous female anything really important.\nMemory never recaptures reality. Memory reconstructs. All reconstructions change the original, becoming external frames of reference that inevitably fall short.\n—MENTAT HANDBOOK\nae and Burzmali entered Ysai from the south into a lower-class quarter with widely spaced streetlights. It lacked only an hour of midnight and yet people thronged the streets in this quarter. Some walked quietly, some chatted with drug-enhanced vigor, some only watched expectantly. They wadded up at the corners and held Lucilla’s fascinated attention as she passed.\nBurzmali urged her to walk faster, an eager customer anxious to get her alone. Lucilla kept her covert attention on the people.\nWhat did they do here? Those men waiting in the doorway: For what did they wait? Workers in heavy aprons emerged from a wide passage as Lucilla and Burzmali passed. There was a thick smell of rank sewage and perspiration about them. The workers, almost equally divided between male and female, were tall, heavy-bodied and with thick arms. Lucilla could not imagine what their occupation might be but they were of a single type and they made her realize how little she knew of Gammu.\nThe workers hawked and spat into the gutter as they emerged into the night. Ridding themselves of some contaminant?\nBurzmali put his mouth close to Lucilla’s ear and whispered: “Those workers are the Bordanos.”\nShe risked a glance back at them where they walked toward a side street. Bordanos? Ahhh, yes: people trained\nand bred to work the compression machinery that harnessed sewer gases. They had been bred to remove the sense of smell and the musculature of shoulders and arms had been increased. Burzmali guided her around a corner and out of sight of the Bordanos.\nFive children emerged from a dark doorway beside them and wheeled into line following Lucilla and Burzmali. Lucilla noted their hands clutching small objects. They followed with a strange intensity. Abruptly, Burzmali stopped and turned. The children also stopped and stared at him. It was clear to Lucilla that the children were prepared for some violence.\nBurzmali clasped both hands in front of him and bowed to the children. He said: “Guldur!”\nWhen Burzmali resumed guiding her down the street, the children no longer followed.\n“They would have stoned us,” he said.\n“Why?”\n“They are children of a sect that follows Guldur—the local name for the Tyrant.”\nLucilla looked back but the children were no longer in sight. They had set off in search of another victim.\nBurzmali guided her around another corner. Now, they were in a street crowded with small merchants selling their wares from wheeled stands—food, clothing, small tools, and knives. A singsong of shouts filled the air as the merchants tried to attract buyers. Their voices had that end of the workday lift—a false brilliance composed of the hope that old dreams would be fulfilled, yet colored by the knowledge that life would not change for them. It occurred to Lucilla that the people of these streets pursued a fleeting dream, that the fulfillment they sought was not the thing itself but a myth they had been conditioned to seek the way racing animals were trained to chase after the whirling bait on the endless oval of the racetrack.\nIn the street directly ahead of them a burly figure ina thickly padded coat was engaged in loud-voiced argument with a merchant who offered a string bag filled with the dark red bulbs of a sweetly acid fruit. The fruit smell was thick all around them. The merchant complained: “You would steal the food from the mouths of my children!”\nThe bulky figure\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4e36d7953c2f92b0faeeadbc6d9cb38c0368f2f8fa58509922064a711fde2e21_v2"}
