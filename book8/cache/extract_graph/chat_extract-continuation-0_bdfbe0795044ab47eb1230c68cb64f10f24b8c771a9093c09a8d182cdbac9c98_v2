“再赢三场就行了。”因为新的对手出现的太快，钱磊索性就不在休息，魂力一恢复到最佳状态，立刻就抛出了自己的召唤金钱，再次召唤。\n\n    此时，老师们都在外面看着，包括银天凡和季洪彬也都来了。期末考试，是这学期检验学员们成绩最重要的考核，更何况今天还是擂台形式。\n\n    当老师们把今天考核模式报给银天凡的时候，银天凡毫不犹豫就同意了。他也想看看，自己这个弟子在这段时间学习之后成长和进步到了什么程度。\n\n    “他们这算不算武魂融合技？”银天凡向身边的季洪彬问道。\n\n    谁都看得出来，正是在蓝轩宇的帮助下，钱磊的召唤才变得靠谱，每一次都能召唤出强大生物，轻而易举的击溃对手。\n\n    季洪彬眉头微蹙，“不好说。应该还没到武魂融合技的程度。他们都才一环修为，就算有武魂融合技也用不出来。你有没有注意到，蓝轩宇增幅的不只是钱磊，对刘锋也是一样。先前刘锋背靠他，在他的辅助下，白龙枪武魂产生了冰属性增幅，这才能轻易化解对手攻击。从某种意义上来说，蓝轩宇这应该算是一种辅助，非常强的辅助。”\n\n    “重要的是，他的辅助对象是两个武魂风马牛不相及的武魂，那是不是意味着，他自身的武魂能够对任何武魂都产生辅助作用。如果是这样的话，那可是了不得的存在。而且，蓝轩宇还不是一个纯粹的辅助性魂师，他在之前的学院之中，是属于控制系的。他自己的战斗力也相当不弱，还是双生武魂……”\n\n    说到这里，季洪彬自己都有种悚然一惊的感觉，这么看来，蓝轩宇这孩子可真的是得天独厚啊！\n\n    如果说唯一有问题的地方，可能就是他的魂力修为提升缓慢了。在普遍其他学员都已经十八级的情况下，他才刚刚晋升到十六级。魂力修炼缓慢越往后很可能就会差距越大，这就不得不让人担心了。\n\n    银天凡微微颔首，“我这弟子，还真的是有意思呢。他的精神力已经两百了，这到真是出乎我的意料。不错、不错。”\n\n    季洪彬道：“你也不要高兴的太早，这孩子的武魂可能是因为太强了，或者说是太特殊了，以至于魂力提升速度缓慢。我们还要继续观察才行。否则的话，天赋再好，没有魂力支持也不可能成为顶级强者。”\n\n    银天凡耸了耸肩膀，道：“有什么关系呢？我对他的期望可不是在个人战斗力方面，而是继承我的衣钵啊！个人实力再强，能和一支宇宙舰队相比吗？”\n\n
