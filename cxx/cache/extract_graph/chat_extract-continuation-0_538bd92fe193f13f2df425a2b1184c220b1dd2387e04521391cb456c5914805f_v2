数只是玩电子游戏的高手。这次华华倒是能鉴别出来，但还是都要了，这时只能将就点儿。以后的应征者则丰富多彩了：\n　　会装液晶电视机的、全国数学竞赛的亚军、会做木工活儿的、烹调大师、针灸专家、武术高手、小植物学家……等等。还有一些暂时不那么实用，但也是国家不可少的人材：有几个很漂亮的女孩儿说自己唱歌跳舞棒极了，还有许多看上去不起眼的孩子拿来了据称是自己作的书画，有个手指细长的白净男孩儿会弹钢琴，还有个头发很长的孩子在儿童文学上发表过小说，有个孩子围棋达到了四段水平……\n　　所有的应征者都是自荐，测验自然不可能，就都通过了。既然人家敢来，多少总会一点吧。\n　　到了下午，应征者仍源源不断，于是成立了一个专门的办公室处理这些事务。随着应征者的增加，除了前面那几类外，人才的领域更加广泛了。\n　　这种形式的国家工作人员征集一直持续到以后很久，意义是极其重大的。如果说最高领导机关的成立拯救了共和国，那么这次征集奠定了国家各领域今后工作的基础。这次全国范围的征集集中了3亿孩子的精华（尤其在科学技术方面），也许后人对他们的真正学识不以为然，但在这个非常时期，一个半熟练的电工可能比十个爱因斯坦还重要。那些参加这次征集工作的小部长们没想到，他们亲自征集来的孩子很快就要取代他们中的很多人。\n　　到下午5点钟，信息大厦中的工作人员已有三百多人。早在上午10点多，孩子们就按最高领导人的指示全面熟悉这座大厦。那几个小电脑专家经过一番折腾，进一步熟悉了大厦中的计算机系统，其包括华华他们已使用过的播放系统和一个意义重大的资料检索系统。\n　　信息大厦除了FG外还有3台巨型计算机，其中两台是国产的银河计算机，一台是从美国进口的CARY--990型计算机。这3台计算机控制着整个大厦的电视和各波段无线广播的播放、对外界的信息接收、大厦内部的信息处理、以及大厦的水电供应和空调系统、生活设施、防火警卫等，整个大厦在巨型电脑的控制下几乎成了一个智能有机体，这大大地帮助了大厦中的孩子们。\n　　事实上，如果没有这座现代化的信息处理大厦，孩子们很难完成管理这个大国的繁重任务。\n　　昔日的大厦设计者们绝不会想到他们的建筑物在历史上能起到这样大的作用。\n　　到了下午，每个部的部长和所有的工作人员都有了自己工作的办公室，华华和小梦仍在通讯中心大厅中工作，在这里，他们随时可同国家的大部分地区联系。最后就剩下了吃饭问题，这事儿交给农业部长去办。大厦有一个后院，其中有一套完整的饮食供应设备，农业部长招来了二十\n######################\nOutput:",
