她的眼睛既老花又近视，看书和看远处时都要换戴眼镜。杨母见到汪淼很高兴，说他的气色看上去比上次好多了。\n　　“都是因为您的人参。”汪淼笑笑说。\n　　杨母摇摇头，“那东西成色不好，那时，在基地周围能采到很好的野山参。我采到过一枝有这么长的……不知现在那里怎么样，听说已经没有人了。唉，老了，最近总是在想以前的事。”\n　　“听说在‘文革’中，您吃过不少苦。”\n　　“听小沙说的吧？”杨母轻轻摆摆手，像拂去面前的一根蛛丝，“过去了，都过去了……昨天小沙来电话，急匆匆的，说些什么我也听不明白，只听出来你好像遇到什么事。小汪啊，其实，你到了我这个年纪，就会发现当年以为天要塌下来的那些大事，其实没有什么的。”\n　　“谢谢您。”汪淼说，他又感到了那种难得的温暖。现在，眼前这位历经沧桑变得平静淡泊的老人，和那位无知而无畏大史，成了他摇摇欲坠的精神世界的两根支柱。\n　　杨母接着说：“说起‘文革’，我还是很幸运的，在活不下去的时候，竟意外地到了一个能活下去的地方。”\n　　“您是说红岸基地吗？”\n　　杨母点点头。\n　　“那真是件不可思议的事情，我最初还以为纯属传说呢。”\n　　“不是传说，要是想知道，我给你讲讲自己经历过的那些事。”\n　　杨母这一说令汪淼有些紧张。“叶老师，我只是好奇而己，要是不方便就算了。”\n　　“哦，没什么的，就当我找人说说话吧，我这阵子也确实想找人说说话。”\n　　“您可以到老年活动室什么的去坐坐，多走动走动总是不寂寞。”\n　　“那些退休的老家伙们好多都是我在大学的同事，但总是同他们融不到一块儿。大家都喜欢念念叨叨地回忆往事，但都希望别人听自己的，而对别人说的都厌烦。红岸那些事，也就你感兴趣了。”\n　　“现在说总还是有些不方便吧？”\n　　“那倒是，毕竟还属于机密。不过那本书出了以后，许多亲历过的人也都在说，都是公开的秘密了。写那本书的人很不负责任，他的目的先放到一边，书中的许多内容也与事实有很大出入，纠正一下也是应该的。”\n　　于是，杨母向汪淼讲述了那段还未尘封的往事。
