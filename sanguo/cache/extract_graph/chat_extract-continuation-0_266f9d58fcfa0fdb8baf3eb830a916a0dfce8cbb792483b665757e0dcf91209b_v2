强之乎？”玄德曰：“先生所言，诚为高见。但备身为汉胄，合当匡扶汉室，何敢委之数与命？”州平曰：“山野之夫，不足与论天下事，适承明问，故妄言之。”玄德曰：“蒙先生见教。但不知孔明往何处去了？”州平曰：“吾亦欲访之，正不知其何往。”玄德曰：“请先生同至敝县，若何？”州平曰：“愚性颇乐闲散，无意功名久矣；容他日再见。”言讫，长揖而去。玄德与关、张上马而行。张飞曰：“孔明又访不着，却遇此腐儒，闲谈许久！”玄德曰：“此亦隐者之言也。”\n\n    三人回至新野，过了数日，玄德使人探听孔明。回报曰：“卧龙先生已回矣。”玄德便教备马。张飞曰：“量一村夫，何必哥哥自去，可使人唤来便了。”玄德叱曰：“汝岂不闻孟子云：欲见贤而不以其道，犹欲其入而闭之门也。孔明当世大贤，岂可召乎！”遂上马再往访孔明。关、张亦乘马相随。时值隆冬，天气严寒，彤云密布。行无数里，忽然朔风凛凛，瑞雪霏霏：山如玉簇，林似银妆。张飞曰：“天寒地冻，尚不用兵，岂宜远见无益之人乎！不如回新野以避风雪。”玄德曰：“吾正欲使孔明知我殷勤之意。如弟辈怕冷，可先回去。”飞曰：“死且不怕，岂怕冷乎！但恐哥哥空劳神思。”玄德曰：“勿多言，只相随同去。”将近茅庐，忽闻路傍酒店中有人作歌。玄德立马听之。其歌曰：“壮士功名尚未成，呜呼久不遇阳春！君不见东海者叟辞荆榛，后车遂与文王亲；八百诸侯不期会，白鱼入舟涉孟津；牧野一战血流杵，鹰扬伟烈冠武臣。又不见高阳酒徒起草中，长楫芒砀隆准公；高谈王霸惊人耳，辍洗延坐钦英风；东下齐城七十二，天下无人能继踪。二人功迹尚如此，至今谁肯论英雄？”歇罢，又有一人击桌而歌。其歌曰：“吾皇提剑清寰海，创业垂基四百载；桓灵季业火德衰，奸臣贼子调鼎鼐。青蛇飞下御座傍，又见妖虹降玉堂；群盗四方如蚁聚，奸雄百辈皆鹰扬，吾侪长啸空拍手，闷来村店饮村酒；独善其身尽日安，何须千古名不朽！”\n\n
