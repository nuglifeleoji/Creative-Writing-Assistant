“你还记得我们第一次去见花冈靖子的情形吗？”草S边走边问岸谷。\n    “记得，有什么不对吗？”\n    “当时，我是怎么问她不在场证明的？三月十日在哪里――我应该是这样问的吧？”\n    “细节我已经记不清楚了，不过我想应该是这样。”\n    “然后她回答：一早就去工作，晚上和女儿出门。去看了电影，然后吃拉面，唱KTV。回家应该已经过了十一点――她是这样说的没错吧？”\n    “我想应该没错。”\n    “据刚才妈妈桑的说法，随后靖子就打了电话给她。而且明明没什么大事，还特地在答录机留言叫她回电。妈妈桑打过去时已过了一点，然后又聊了三十分钟左右。”\n    “那有什么不对吗？”\n    “那时――我问她不在场证明时，靖子为什么没提到这件事呢？”\n    “为什么……应该是觉得没必要吧。”\n    “为什么？”草S伫足，转身面对刑警学弟，“用自家电话和第三者说过话，这可以证明她在家喔。”\n    岸谷也停下脚，嘟起嘴，说道：\n    “是没错，可是从花冈靖子的角度来看，只要说出外出地点，应该已经足够了。如果草S先生进一步追问回家后的事，我想她应该会说出打电话的事。”\n    “真的只是这个的理由吗？”\n    “不然还能有什么理由？如果是隐瞒自己缺少不在场证明那还有话说，现在她可没提自己有不在场证明喔。前辈追究这点未免太奇怪了。”\n    草S将目光从一脸不满的岸谷身上转开，径自迈步走出。这个刑警学弟，打从一开始就同情花冈母女，向他征求客观意见或许本来就错了。\n    今天白天和汤川的那番对话，又在草S的脑中复苏。那个物理学者坚称，如果命案和石神有关那就决不可能是计划性杀人。\n    “如果是他策划的，他不会用电影院当作不在场证明。”汤川首先举出这点，“因为正如你们所怀疑的，去看电影的这种供述太没说服力了。石神不可能没想到这一点。此外，还有个更大的疑问：石神没理由协助花冈靖子杀害富坚。就算她被富坚苦苦折磨，以他的个性应该也会另谋解决之道，绝不会选择杀人这种方法。”\n    你的意思是石神不是那么残酷的人吗？草S问。汤川带着冷静的目光摇头。\n    “不是感情上的问题，而是企图用杀人逃离痛苦的方法不够合理。因为杀人之后，又会因此产生别的痛苦。石神不会做那种蠢事。反过来说，只要合乎逻辑，就算再怎么残酷的事他也做得出来。”\n    那么汤川认为，石神到底是以什么方式涉及本案？关于这点汤\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
