南澄突然明白过来，他那一声谢谢，似乎是感谢自己站起来给他让了路？毕竟，每一排座椅之间的空间是有限的。\n\n    可是，自己旁边没有别的女性了啊！啊？他不会是要让蓝潇跟他上台吧？难道，乐公子他喜欢的不是女性？\n\n    巨大的落差令南澄的心都要纠结在一起了。\n\n    但是，也就在这时，她发现乐公子就在自己身边停了下来，然后他弯下腰，微笑着道：“可以请你陪我上台演出吗？”\n\n    南澄扭头看去，然后就懵了。\n\n    乐公子的目标，当然不是蓝潇，而是她一直忽略了的，从台上甚至都很难看得到，因为身材矮小大部分身体都被前面一排椅背挡住的蓝轩宇。\n\n    蓝轩宇也有些发愣，然后下意识的道：“你请我妈妈上去吧。我妈妈可喜欢你了。”他抬手指了指身边的南澄。\n\n    巨大的幸福感扑面而来，南澄这会儿真想把儿子抱起来狠狠的亲几口。这真是比亲儿子还亲儿子啊！\n\n    乐公子摇了摇头，“不啦，我只想邀请你。可以吗？”他澄澈的蓝色眼眸就在蓝轩宇近在咫尺。\n\n    蓝轩宇呆了呆，不知道为什么，他发现自己竟然有点没法拒绝他的感觉。下意识的点了点头。\n\n    乐公子很自然的一伸手，将蓝轩宇从椅子上抱了起来，抱在自己怀中。\n\n    当蓝轩宇被他抱起来那一瞬间，只觉得一种特别熟悉的安全感瞬间传遍全身。虽然陌生，可是却突然觉得特别的亲切。这种亲切，似乎只是在娜娜老师身上才感受过。但娜娜老师是那种让他想要主动亲近的感觉，而眼前的乐公子，是一种让他特别感到安心的亲近感。\n\n    乐公子笑了，在这一瞬，他眉宇间的那份忧郁似乎也随之消失了。那是一种发自内心的开心笑容。然后他向蓝轩宇两边的蓝潇和南澄点了点头，就那么抱着蓝轩宇走向舞台。\n\n    他刚才看的不是我？一直都是轩宇么？轩宇的杀伤力竟然连乐公子都要被吸引的么？\n\n    南澄有些发懵。\n\n    而也就在这时，身边传来一个幽幽的声音，“看起来，有些人是想多了啊！”\n\n    南澄猛然回头，恶狠狠的看向蓝潇，“今晚，不，之后一周，你睡客厅。”\n\n    “我……”蓝潇一脸的无奈，但却更是好笑。\n\n    此时，其他观众们自然也都看到了乐公子是从观众席抱了个孩子。尽管此时的女歌迷们心中最大的想法\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
