\n　　田福堂、金俊山立刻喊叫让大家赶快加高坝梁。刹那间，所有的人都进入了一种疯狂的劳动之中。到处是紧张的喊叫声和铁锨镢头的碰磕声。 \n　　但是情况越来越不妙。坝里的水一会比一会上升得快！所有的人几乎已经拼上了老命，但加高坝的速度已经赶不上坝里水上升的速度了。 \n　　完了！谁都意识到后果会是什么样子，但所有的人又都不放弃最后一丝希望。有些人已经不是劳动，而是在挣命，一边发疯似的挖土，一边累得嘴里呻吟着，有几个老汉已经蹲在一边哭开了！ \n　　田福堂心里象烧着火一般焦灼。他气愤地把孙玉亭和金俊武这些人喊叫到跟前，问他们倒究是怎么回事？玉亭说：“金富和金强不听我的话，在石圪节的坝梁中间豁开了一道口子……” \n　　水已经无情地漫上了坝沿，并且打起了第一个浪头，把最上面刚填上去的虚土冲掉了。不知谁喊了一声：“快跑！坝要垮了！” \n　　人们立刻大呼小叫，夹杂着妇女和孩子们的哭声，纷纷从坝两边退到了高处。大家往后河道里一看：妈呀，水已经象山洪暴发一般，满河道涌下来了！ \n　　双水村的土坝顷刻间就象一道纸墙一般被汹涌的浪头冲垮了。东拉河震响着洪水的咆哮声，把人们的希望一卷而空！ \n　　所有的人现在都泪水汪汪地立在河两岸，眼看着这滔滔的水从他们的面前流过。水呀，你多么可爱，可你又多么无情！ \n　　半个钟头以后，洪水才落下了。 \n　　东拉河粗野地吼叫了一阵以后，慢慢地又安静了下来。 \n　　但是，河两岸的人却象从一场恶梦中突然惊醒似的，再一次骚乱起来了。人们现在才想到，有没有什么东西被水冲走呢？或者更坏的是，有没有人被这洪水吞没了呢？ \n　　于是，两岸到处都传来了人的喊叫声。各家人叫各家人的名字。因为刚才水把人隔在了两岸，许多家的人都失散了。人们连鞋也不脱，裤子也不挽，纷纷淌过洪水落下的东拉河，跑到对岸去寻找坝冲垮以后还没照过面的亲人。不管这些人是否遭了难，但寻找的人先放声哭叫起来。河道里不时有人滑得仰面朝天掼倒在泥滩里，但谁也顾不了这些，爬起来又喊着，嚎着，跑向了对岸。 \n　　不久，一个令人毛骨悚然的消息就传遍了全村：金俊武的弟弟金俊斌不\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TIAN FUTANG<|>PERSON<|>Tian Futang is a person who is leading
