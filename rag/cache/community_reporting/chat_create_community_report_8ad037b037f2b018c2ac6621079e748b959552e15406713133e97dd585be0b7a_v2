These ruling dynasties, including **House Atreides** and **House Harkonnen**, vie for influence within the **Landsraad**, the imperial assembly where alliances and rivalries shape the fate of the Imperium. Bound by the **Great Convention**, which prohibits the use of atomic weapons like the **stone burner**, the Great Houses engage in intricate power struggles while adhering to the empire's strict codes.  \n\nOnce dominant in wealth and influence, some Great Houses lament their diminished status, particularly those who have lost their **spice riches**, though a few retain small hoards under **Leto's empire**. Their delegates play key roles in political schemes, including **betrothal plots** and strategic marriages, such as those seeking alliance with the **Duke**. The **Emperor** often rallies them against threats like the **Baron**, leveraging their military might—such as the **armada stationed over Arrakis**—to enforce imperial will.  \n\nWhile historically formidable, the Great Houses now face shifting dynamics, with **Houses Minor** rising in influence. Their collective opinions and allegiances remain pivotal, capable of opposing figures like **Paul** or shaping imperial policy. Despite their diminished glory, they remain central to the Imperium's feudal structure, embodying both its enduring traditions and its volatile power struggles.\",16\n14,IMPERIUM,\"The **Imperium** is the vast feudal galactic empire that governs the known universe in the *Dune* series. It is a technocratic and hierarchical political entity ruled by the **Padishah Emperors**, with power distributed among the **Great Houses**, the **Landsraad** (a council of noble houses), and key organizations like the **Spacing Guild** and **CHOAM** (the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles). The Imperium's military strength relies heavily on the **Sardaukar**, the Emperor’s elite troops, while its economy is dominated by the spice **melange**, harvested from the desert planet **Arrakis (Dune)**, the empire’s focal point.  \n\nInitially ruled by **House Corrino**, the Imperium’s leadership shifts after **Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib)** overthrows Emperor **Shaddam IV**, establishing **House Atreides** as the new ruling dynasty. Following Paul’s reign, his sister **Alia** serves as regent, maintaining control amid political and religious turmoil. Later, Paul’s son **Leto II** ascends to power, further transforming the Imperium through his godlike rule.  \n\nThe Imperium’s stability depends on a delicate balance between the Great Houses (such as **Atreides, Harkonnen, and Corrino**), the **Bene Gesserit**, and the Spacing Guild. Conflicts over spice, planetary fiefdoms, and imperial succession drive much of the empire’s intrigue.
