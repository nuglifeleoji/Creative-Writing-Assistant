\n　　田福堂看两位主任说话越来越不对劲，就机灵地站起来，另外掏出两根“大前门”烟，说：“白主任，徐主任，抽烟。” \n　　两位主任只好暂时停止了唇枪舌战，接过田福堂递上的纸烟。福堂赶紧又用自己的打火机给他们分别点着。 \n　　白明川站在脚地上抽了两口烟，又对坐在椅子上的徐治功说开了：“咱们不是说不搞阶级斗争，但不能光一个‘狠’字，还要‘稳、准’。牛家沟这妇女，不就是为一棵花椒树被队里没收了，骂了几句大队书记吗？拉到工地上教育一下也行，但不能损躏身体嘛！那么重的活，别说一个妇女，好后生都够受！现在弄得大出血，万一死了怎么办？够不够死罪？给家里人怎交待？” \n　　徐治功现在看来不想理白明川，但并不是服气他的话。他坐在椅子上，头拐在一旁，吊着个脸就是个抽烟。 \n　　白明川实际上比徐治功还小两岁，但看起来比徐治功年龄大。他身体肥肥壮壮，两只眼睛又大又有光气，脸上围着一圈黑胡楂子，头发可倒显顶了。他穿一身肮脏油腻的衣服，披一领光板老羊皮袄，看起来象个炊事员或者山区的汽车司机。 \n　　自明川是一九六六年的高中毕业生，六九年底返乡劳动。七○年县武装部招一批武装专干，他被招收了，分在城关公社工作。当年冬天组织全公社民兵冬训时，一个民兵将一颗拉了线的手榴弹没有甩到前面去，反而手一扬滑落在了后面的人堆里。武装专干白明川眼疾手快，把这颗冒烟的手榴弹捡起，扔了出去，避免了一场大灾祸。为此，不仅省地军区，连兰州大军区都发出通报表扬了他。第二年他被提升为城关公社副主任。前年又调到石圪节公社当了一把手。明川在中学时学习就很拔尖，并且还能写点诗。他人虽然年轻，但脑瓜子可不年轻。当然，上面布置下来的所有任务，他和徐治功一样，都要积极完成。但他的做法和徐治功不一样。因为他自己也是农民的儿子，所以他往往对过分伤害农民的做法反感。只要他能抗住的，都尽力往住抗。但治功又和他完全相反，常常爱用一些过头加码的做法。治功也许是为了把工作做好，可是有些做法太不象话了……“……再比如，高家湾高廷亮，只是耕自留地时多占了队里的两铧，纠正过来，在生产队做个检查就行了，也拉来劳教……”
