\n　　不一会，孩子睡着了。他小心翼翼地把这小家伙的头搁在枕头上，然后拉了条小被盖住，就又从炕上下来，转到炕火圪崂帮助红梅烧火。 \n　　火烤得他额头上汗水淋漓——但多半是因为他内心过分紧张。红梅就在锅台旁边和面。她离他这么近！ \n　　他一边烧火，一边拼命地咽口水。他一路上已经反复想好他要对她说的话——可现在感到如此难开口啊！ \n　　他把一块干柴塞到灶膛后，嘴唇哆嗦了半天，才讷讷着说：“红……梅，我想对你……说句话……” \n　　红梅停止了和面，默默地看着他，显然是等他说那句“话”。 \n　　润生没敢抬头看她，用很大的力气鼓着劲说：“咱两个……能不能一块过日子？” \n　　红梅呆呆地立在锅台旁，低倾下了头。 \n　　半天，她才小声说：“我这个样子，怎能配得上你……” \n　　润生素性不烧火了，从灶火圪崂里站起来，激动地说：“我已经下了决心，一定要和你一块过！” \n　　红梅仍然低着头，两条腿微微地抖着，说：“你不要凭一时冲动。以后你会后悔的……” \n　　“不！我想了好多时了！我……我现在只要你的一句话，跟不跟我？你相信我！我决不会亏待你和娃娃……”“你们家的老人不会同意的……” \n　　“我要说服他们！只要你同意，我就有信心说服我父母亲！你同意不同意呀？” \n　　“我……”红梅哭了。 \n　　润生勇敢地走过去，伸出两条瘦胳膊，紧紧地抱住了她。红梅垂着两只面手，脸依恋地伏在他胸前，哭得更伤心了。润生的眼里也含满了泪水。他紧紧地抱着她，自己却怵软得象一团棉花。 \n　　“不要为难，润生。你要回去把老人说通，咱们两个再说这事。不管时间长短，我都等你！”红梅在他怀里哭着说。“这事你别担心！我要说的是，我这汽车也开不长久，说不定马上得回去劳动；要是这样，你一辈子还得跟上我受苦……” \n　　“劳动怕什么呢！咱们就一辈子安安稳稳在农村过光景，只要你对我好，跟上你就是去要饭，我也情愿。只不过你对我的娃娃也要好……” \n　　“这还要你说哩！娃娃就是我的娃娃！咱们结婚了。我就是这娃娃的父亲！” \n　　这天夜晚，润生就在红梅家里留宿了。 \n　　第二天，他象获得了新生一般容光焕发。他感激地告别了他亲爱的人，立即返回原西去找父亲商谈他的终身\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
