，金俊海就是个“穷人”。“你现在出了门，你就知道，外面并不是天堂。但一个男子汉，老守在咱双水村那个土圪崂里，又有什么意思？人就得闯世事！安安稳稳活一辈子，还不如痛痛快快甩打几下就死了！即是受点磨难，只要能多经一些世事，死了也不后悔！”金波一边说，一边狠狠地吸着烟。 \n　　少平听了金波的话后，大为震惊。他没想到，他的朋友的思想竟然和他如此相似！他发现金波不只是那个又聪敏又调皮的金波了——他已经变得成熟而深沉起来了。 \n　　这样，他把半脸盆面片吃光以后，就坦率地向他的朋友叙说了他为什么要离家出走；而跑出来后的这两个月，他又经历了什么样的生活……金波静静地听完他的叙说，并没有表现出惊讶，他说：“我能想得来，我赞成你的做法！虽然咱们出身低层人家，但不能小看自己。我们这样生活，精神上并不见得就比那些上大学和当干部的人差！你看的书比我多，你更能明白这些道理……” \n　　“不过，对我来说，这种生活付出的代价太大了。我和你不一样。家里老的老，小的小，我这么大了，按说应该守在老人身边尽孝心。现在，我把一切都扔给我爸和我哥了……” \n　　少平点着金波递过来的纸烟，情绪满含着忧伤。金波用安慰的口吻说：“象我们这种人，实际上最重情义了。我们任何时候都不会逃避自己对家庭和父母应尽的责任。但我们又有自己的生活理想呀！比如说你吧，根本不可能变成少安哥！” \n　　“是呀，最叫人痛苦的是，你出身于一个农民家庭，但又想挣脱这样的家庭；挣脱不了，又想挣脱……” \n　　话到此时，两位朋友便不再言语，长久地陷入到一种沉思之中。桌子上那只旧马蹄表有声有响地走着，屋子里弥漫着烟雾。外面不远处的电影院大概刚散场，嘈杂的人声从敞开的窗户里传进来，仍然没有打破这间小屋的沉静。他们各自抽各自的烟，也不知道都想了些什么。 \n　　晚上睡下后，他们还是合不住眼，从小时候的双水村说到上初中时的石圪节；又从石圪节说到原西县上高中的那些日子。他们说自己的事，也说其他同学的事。自高中毕业分手后，许多同学的情况他们都不知道了。记得那时间，大家都信誓旦旦地表示，他们全班同学有一天还会重新相聚。现在看来，那纯粹是一种少年之梦。一旦独立地投入严峻的生活，中学生的浪漫情调很快就烟消云散了。 \n　　两个好朋友一直把话拉到天明。尽管一晚上没睡觉，但他们仍然十分兴奋。 \n　　吃完早饭后，金波\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金俊海<|>PERSON<|>金俊海 is portrayed as a poor man who
