For what are we Supposed to pay?”\n“| beg of you, Ser Waff, drop these foolish pretenses in this room. There are facts known to both of us that cannot be avoided.”\n“Such as?”\n“No female of the Bene Tleilax has ever been provided to us for breeding.” And she thought: Let him sweat that one! It was damnably frustrating not to have a line of Tleilaxu Other Memories for Bene Gesserit investigation and Waff would know it.\nWaff scowled. “Surely you don’t think | would bargain with the life of—” He broke off and shook his head. “I cannot believe this is the payment you would ask.”\nWhen Taraza did not respond, Waff said: “The stupid attack on the Rakian temple was undertaken independently by people on the scene. They have been punished.”\nExpected gambit number three, Taraza thought.\nShe had participated in numerous analysis-briefings before this meeting, if one could call them briefings. Analyses there had been in excess. Very little was known about this Tleilaxu Master, this Tylwyth Waff. Some extremely important optional projections had been arrived at by inference (if these proved to be true). The trouble was that some of the most interesting data came from unreliable sources. One salient fact could be depended upon, however: The elfin figure seated across from her was deadly dangerous.\nWaff’s gambit number three engaged her attention. It was time to respond. Taraza produced a knowing smile.\n“That is precisely the kind of lie we expected from you,” she said.\n“Do we begin with insults?” He spoke without heat.\n“You set the pattern. Let me warn you that you will not be able to deal with us the way you dealt with those whores\nfrom the Scattering.”\nWaff’s frozen stare invited Taraza to a daring gambit. The Sisterhood’s deductions, based partly on the disappearance of an Ixian conference ship, were accurate! Maintaining her same smile, she now pursued the optional conjecture line as though it were known fact. “I think,” she said, “the whores might like to learn that they have had Face Dancers among them.”\nWaff suppressed his anger. These damnable witches! They knew! Somehow, they knew! His councillors had been extremely doubtful about this meeting. A substantial minority had recommended against it. The witches were so...so devilish. And their retaliations!\nTime to shift his attention to Gammu, Taraza thought. Keep him off balance. She said: “Even when you subvert one of us, as you did with Schwangyu on Gammu, you learn nothing of value!”\nWaff flared: “She thought to... to hire us like a band of assassins! We only taught her a lesson!”\nAhhhh, his pride shows itself, Taraza thought. /nteresting. The implications of a moral structure behind such pride must be explored.\n“You've never really penetrated our ranks,” Taraza said.\n“And you have never penetrated the Tleilaxu!” Waff managed to produce this boast with passable calm. He needed time to think! To plan!\n“Perhaps you would like to Know the price of our silence,” Taraza suggested. She took Waff’s stony glare for agreement and added: “For one thing, you will share with us everything you learn about those Scattering-spawned whores who call themselves Honored Matres.”\nWaff shuddered. Much had been confirmed by killing the Honored Matres. The sexual intricacies! Only the strongest psyche could resist entanglement in such ecstasies. The potential of this tool was enormous! Must that be shared with these witches?\n“Everything you learn from them,” Taraza insisted.\n“Why do you call them whores?”\n“They try to copy us, yet they sell themselves for power and make a mockery of everything we represent. Honored Matres!”\n“They outnumber you at least ten thousand to one! We have seen the evidence.”\n“One of us could defeat them all,” Taraza said.\nWaff sat in silence, studying her. Was that merely a boast? You could never be sure when it came to the Bene Gesserit witches. They did things. The dark side of the magic universe belonged to them. On more than one occasion the witches had blunted the Shariat. Was it God’s will that the true believers pass through another trial?\nTaraza allowed the silence to continue building its own tensions. She sensed Waff’s turmoil. It reminded her of the Sisterhood’s preliminary conference in preparation for this meeting with him. Bellonda had asked the question of deceptive simplicity:\n“What do we really know about the Tleilaxu?”\nTaraza had felt the answer surge into every mind around the Chapter House conference table: We may know for sure only what they want us to know.\nNone of her analysts could avoid the suspicion that the Tleilaxu had deliberately created a masking-image of themselves. Tleilaxu intelligence had to be measured against the fact that they alone controlled the secret of the axlotl tanks. Was that a lucky accident as some suggested? Then why had others been unable to duplicate this accomplishment in all of these millennia?\nGholas.\nWere the Tleilaxu using the ghola process for their own kind of immortality? She could see suggestive hints in Waff’s actions .. . nothing definite, but highly suspicious.\nAt the Chapter House conferences, Bellonda had returned repeatedly to their basic suspicions, hammering at them:\n“All of it... all of it, | say! Everything in our archives could be garbage fit only for slig fodder!”\nThis allusion had caused some of the more relaxed Reverend Mothers around the table to shudder.\nSligs!\nThose slowly creeping crosses between giant slugs and pigs might provide meat for some of the most expensive meals in their universe but the creatures themselves embodied everything the Sisterhood held repugnant about the Tleilaxu. Sligs had been one of the earliest Bene Tleilax barter items, a product grown in their tanks and formed with the helical core from which all life took its shapes. That the Bene Tleilax made them added to the aura of obscenity around a creature whose multi-mouths ground incessantly on almost any garbage, passing that garbage swiftly into excrement that not only smelled of the sty but was slimy.\n“The sweetest meat this side of heaven,” Bellonda had quoted from a CHOAM promotion.\n“And it comes from obscenity,” Taraza had added.\nObscenity.\nTaraza thought of this as she stared at Waff. For what possible reason might people build around themselves a mask of obscenity? Waff’s flare of pride could not be fitted neatly into that image.\nWaff coughed lightly into his hand. He felt the pressure of the seams where he had concealed two of his potent dart- throwers. The minority among his councillors had advised: “As with the Honored Matres, the winner in this encounter with the Bene Gesserit will be the one who emerges carrying the most secret information about the other. Death of the opponent guarantees success.”\n| might kill her but what then?\nThree more full Reverend Mothers waited outside that hatch. Doubtless Taraza had a signal prepared for the instant the hatch was opened. Without that signal, violence and disaster were sure to ensue. He did not believe for an\ninstant that even his new Face Dancers could overcome those Reverend Mothers out there. The witches would be on full alert. They would have recognized the nature of Waff’s guards.\n“We will share,” Waff said. The admissions implicit in this hurt him but he knew he had no alternatives. Taraza’s brag about relative abilities might be inaccurate because of its extreme claim, but he sensed truth in it nonetheless. He had no illusions, however, about what would ensue if the Honored Matres learned what had actually happened to their envoys. The missing no-ship could not yet be laid at the Tleilaxu door. Ships did vanish. Deliberate assassination was another matter altogether. The Honored Matres surely would try to exterminate such a brash opponent. If only as an example. Tleilaxu returned from the Scattering said as much. Having seen Honored Matres, Waff now believed those stories.\nTaraza said: “My second agenda item for this meeting is our ghola.”\nWaff squirmed in the sling chair.\nTaraza felt repelled by Waff’s tiny eyes, the round face with its snub nose and too-sharp teeth.\n“You have been killing our gholas to control the movement of a project in which you have no part other than to provide a single element,” Taraza accused.\nWaff once more wondered if he must kill her. Was nothing hidden from these damnable witches? The implication that the Bene Gesserit had a traitor in the Tleilaxu core could not be ignored. How else could they know?\nHe said: “I assure you, Reverend Mother Superior, that the ghola—”\n“Assure me of nothing! We assure ourselves.” A look of sadness on her face, Taraza shook her head slowly from side to side. “And you think we don’t know that you sold us damaged goods.”\nWaff spoke quickly: “He meets every requirement imposed by your contract!”\nAgain, Taraza shook her head from side to side. This diminutive Tleilaxu Master had no idea what he was revealing here. “You have buried your own scheme in his psyche,” Taraza said. “I warn you, Ser Waff, that if your alterations obstruct our design, we will wound you deeper than you think possible.”\nWaff passed a hand across his face, feeling the perspiration on his forehead. Damnable witches! But she did not know everything. The Tleilaxu returned from the Scattering and the Honored Matres she maligned so bitterly had provided the Tleilaxu with a sexually loaded weapon that would not be shared, no matter the promises made here!\nTaraza digested Waff’s reactions silently and decided ona bold lie. “When we captured your Ixian conference ship, your new Face Dancers did not die quite fast enough. We learned a great deal.”\nWaff poised himself on the edge of violence.\nBullseye! Taraza thought. The bold lie had opened an avenue of revelation into one of the more outrageous suggestions from her advisors. It did not seem outrageous now. “The Tleilaxu ambition is to produce a complete prana- bindu mimic,” her advisor had suggested.\n“Complete?”\nAll of the Sisters at the conference had been astonished by the suggestion. It implied a form of mental copy going beyond the memory print about which they already knew.\nThe advisor, Sister Hesterion from Archives, had come armed with a tightly organized list of supporting material. “We already know that what an Ixian Probe does mechanically, the Tleilaxu do with nerves and flesh. The next step is obvious.”\nSeeing Waff’s reaction to her bold lie, Taraza continued to watch him carefully. He was at his most dangerous right\nnow.\nA look of rage came over Waff’s face. The things the witches knew were too dangerous! He did not doubt Taraza’s claim in the slightest. / must kill her no matter the consequences to me! We must kill them all. Abominations! It’s their word and it describes them perfectly.\nTaraza correctly interpreted his expression. She spoke quickly: “You are in absolutely no danger from us as long as you do not injure our designs. Your religion, your way of life, those are your business.”\nWaff hesitated, not so much from what Taraza said as from the reminder of her powers. What else did they know? To continue in a subservient position, though!\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_86fb7ee6fcd1d55eec0fd955f3a395039d567fd5afcea07aade372d8b40dafcd_v2"}
