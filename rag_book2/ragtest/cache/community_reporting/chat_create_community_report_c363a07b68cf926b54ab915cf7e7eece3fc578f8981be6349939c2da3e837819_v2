He is depicted as a friend of Yuichi, though their relationship appears strained due to牟田's volatile behavior. According to one account,牟田 allegedly asked Yuichi to take photos of students, though the context or motive behind this request remains unclear. In another instance,牟田 is described as exhibiting aggressive tendencies, physically assaulting Yuichi in a fit of anger. This contradiction suggests牟田's demeanor may shift between manipulative or coercive behavior and outright violence. Further details would be needed to reconcile these portrayals, but the combined descriptions paint牟田 as an unstable figure whose actions range from questionable to outright hostile, particularly toward Yuichi.\",3\n124,雄一,\"雄一（Yuichi）是一名学生，与菊池和桐原等人有交集，性格内向且对摄影有浓厚兴趣。他因在校外拍摄学生照片而被怀疑涉及偷拍事件，并因此被班主任询问。尽管与桐原是朋友，但他对四年前某案件的细节并不清楚，只是在听菊池叙述时表现出震惊。  \n\n雄一在故事中经历了多方面的冲突。他试图缓和与菊池的关系，但遭到对方的冷落；同时，他还遭受了牟田等人的肢体暴力，表现出明显的痛苦与无助。此外，他展现出对摄影的细致追求，常在房间内处理照片，体现出专注与耐心的一面。  \n\n他的行动也揭示了某些隐秘的兴趣。例如，他曾前往清华女子学园观察藤村都子演奏小提琴，暗示他对特定人物或场景的关注。尽管部分描述看似矛盾（如被怀疑偷拍的同时又表现出对摄影的艺术性追求），但综合来看，雄一可能是一个因爱好而被误解的学生，其行为更多出于个人兴趣而非恶意。  \n\n总体而言，雄一是一个复杂且略带悲剧色彩的角色，既遭受外界的暴力与猜疑，又试图通过摄影和观察他人来寻找自己的空间。他的经历反映了校园生活中的孤立与误解。\",16\n133,洗脸台,\"The **洗脸台** (sink/washbasin) is a fixture located in **雄一's house**, serving multiple purposes depending on the context.

Additionally, the same washbasin is utilized by 雄一 as a dedicated space for **rinsing developed photographs**, indicating its dual role in both personal grooming and photographic development.  \n\nThis combination of uses suggests that the **洗脸台** is a practical and versatile feature of 雄一's living space, accommodating both routine tasks and specialized hobbies.
