生活在石圪节，遇县上开会，才能回城里住几天。他当副主任的时候，就想回县上去工作——哪怕平调回去都可以，结果他没能回去，换来的好处是副主任升成了正主任。 \n　　他一个人在石圪节，当个“土皇帝”，倒也满足了他的虚荣心；但就是感到日子过得单调而乏味。 \n　　因此，王彩娥主动往他怀里扑，他就神魂颠倒地乐意被这风流女人“俘虏”了。 \n　　两个人的这种关系已经有很长一段时间。他们不知道，尽管遮盖得严密，有关他们的风声，早在石圪节传播得风一股雨一股。 \n　　这几天石圪节“大乱”的时候，正是他们两个的好机会。让胡得禄去看戏吧！他们在理发店后面的小房子里演他们自己的“戏”，尽管这房子离街道很近，但门一关，就和外面闹哄哄的世界隔绝了……但这天下午，事情突然败露在了胡得禄他哥胡得福面前。厨师胡得福带一把弟弟门上的钥匙，跑来给他们送猪肝的。没料到推门进屋后，看见公社的徐主任和彩娥大白天睡在一个被窝里。 \n　　胡得福气得脸象手里的猪肝一样，说了句：“我找张有智去告你！”就门一掼走了。 \n　　惊慌失措的徐治功赶忙穿起衣服，哭丧着脸叫道：“天啊，这下完了！” \n　　王彩娥又象上次和孙玉亭的事败露后那样，镇定地对徐主任说：“甭怕！让他告屁也不顶！我不承认，能把你怎？”徐治功感动得泪花子在眼里直转。 \n　　但他慌得再也不敢在这个小屋里呆下去，立刻象兔子一般窜出了门。 \n　　治功心慌意乱地从街道上的人群里挤过来。所有认识他的庄稼人都尊敬地给他打招呼，他只是牙疼似的给这些人咧一咧嘴，只顾向前走。 \n　　可是他并不知道他要到哪里去。 \n　　不断有熟人给他打招呼。天啊，哪来的这么多熟人！他现在需要一个人躲到什么地方去，想想看这怎办呀。 \n　　一辆汽车从对面的公路上停下来，许多人正往上挤。徐治功似乎看见胖炉头胡得福也挤上去了。一切都完了！他知道“红烧肘子专家”常被请到县里摆宴会，所有的领导人他都认识——一个多钟头以后，胡师傅就会坐在县委书记张有智的办公室里，告他徐治功……徐治功为了摆脱街上的熟人，赶忙往他的“大本营”公社走去。 \n　　快到公社时，他又想到，此刻那里也不是个好去处！说不定一群人在等他解决问题哩！ \n　　他急中生智，折转身拐进了土坡旁边的厕所里。好地方！ \n　　他蹲在茅坑上，既不拉屎又不撒尿，只是为了想想他该怎么\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>石圪节<|>GEO<|>石圪节 is a location where the
