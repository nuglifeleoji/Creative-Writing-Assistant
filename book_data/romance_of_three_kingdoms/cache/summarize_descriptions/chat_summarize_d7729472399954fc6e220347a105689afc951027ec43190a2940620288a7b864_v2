He is primarily known for his role as the governor of 雍州, where he took decisive measures to mobilize troops in response to military campaigns against the forces of 蜀. His leadership in this capacity highlights his commitment to defending his territory and supporting the broader military objectives of his time.\n\nIn addition to his military responsibilities, 王经 is also remembered for his principled stance against 贾充, a powerful figure whose actions were viewed as detrimental to the interests of 曹髦, the ruler he served. 王经's protest against 贾充's decisions underscores his loyalty to 曹髦 and his willingness to stand up for what he believed was right, even in the face of potential repercussions. This act of defiance ultimately led to consequences for 王经, illustrating the risks associated with loyalty and integrity in a politically charged environment.\n\nThrough these actions, 王经 emerges as a complex character who navigated the challenges of governance and military leadership while remaining steadfast in his principles. His legacy is marked by both his military contributions and his moral courage in opposing influential figures of his time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754984170, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
