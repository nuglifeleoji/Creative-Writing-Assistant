How could she respond to him with something he didn’t already\nknow? This was monstrous! He’s me! He’s my beloved Leto! This thought shocked her. Momentarily she wondered if the childish mask might not lapse into those dear features and resurrect... No!\nLeto lowered his head, looked upward to study her. Yes, she could be maneuvered after all. He said: “When you think of prescience, which | hope is rarely, you’re probably no different from any other. Most people imagine how nice it would be to know tomorrow’s quotation on the price of whale fur. Or whether a Harkonnen will once more govern their homeworld of Giedi Prime? But of course we know the Harkonnens without prescience, don’t we, grandmother?”\nShe refused to rise to his baiting. Of course he would know about the cursed Harkonnen blood in his ancestry.\n“Who is a Harkonnen?” he asked, goading. “Who is Beast Rabban? Any one of us, eh? But | digress. | speak the popular myth of prescience: to know the future absolutely! All of it! What fortunes could be made—and lost—on such absolute knowledge, eh? The rabble believes this. They believe that if a little bit is good, more must be better. How excellent! And if you handed one of them the complete scenario of his life, the unvarying dialogue up to his moment of death—what a hellish gift that’d be. What utter boredom! Every living instant he’d be replaying what he knew absolutely. No deviation. He could anticipate every response, every utterance—over and over and over and over and overand...”\nLeto shook his head. “Ignorance has its advantages. A universe of surprises is what | pray for!”\nIt was a long speech and, as she listened, Jessica marveled at how his mannerisms, his intonations, echoed his father—her lost son. Even the ideas: these were things Paul might have said.\n“You remind me of your father,” she said.\n“Is that hurtful to you?”\n“In a way, but it’s reassuring to know he lives on in you.”\n“How little you understand of how he lives on in me.”\nJessica found his tone flat but dripping bitterness. She lifted her chin to look directly at him.\n“Or how your Duke lives in me,” Leto said. “Grandmother, Ghanima is you! She’s you to such an extent that your life holds not a single secret from her up to the instant you bore our father. And me! What a catalogue of fleshly recordings am |. There are moments when it is too much to bear. You come here to judge us? You come here to judge Alia? Better that we judge you!”\nJessica demanded answers of herself and found none. What was he doing? Why this emphasis on his difference? Did he court rejection? Had he reached Alia’s condition— Abomination?\n“This disturbs you,” he said.\n“It disturbs me.” She permitted herself a futile shrug. “Yes, it disturbs me—and for reasons you know full well. I’m sure you've reviewed my Bene Gesserit training. Ghanima admits it. | know Alia... did. You know the consequences of your difference.”\nHe peered upward at her with disturbing intensity. “Almost, we did not take this tack with you,” he said, and there was a sense of her own fatigue in his voice. “We know the fluttering of your lips as your lover knew them. Any bedchamber endearment your Duke whispered is ours to recall at will. You’ve accepted this intellectually, no doubt. But | warn you that intellectual acceptance is not enough. If any of us becomes Abomination—it could be you within us who creates it! Or my father... or mother! Your Duke! Any one of you could possess us—and the condition would be the same.”\nJessica felt a burning in her chest, dampness in her eyes. “Leto...” she managed, allowing herself to use his name at last. She found the pain less than she’d imagined it would be, forced herself to continue. “What is it you want of me?”\n“I would teach my grandmother.”\n“Teach me what?”\n“Last night, Ghani and | played the mother-father roles almost to our destruction, but we learned much. There are things one can know, given an awareness of conditions. Actions can be predicted. Alia, now—it’s well nigh certainty that she’s plotting to abduct you.”\nJessica blinked, shocked by the swift accusation. She knew this trick well, had employed it many times: set a person up along one line of reasoning, then introduce the shocker from another line. She recovered with a sharp intake of breath.\n“I know what Alia has been doing .. . what she Js,\nDUE seen\n“Grandmother, pity her. Use your heart as well as your intelligence. You’ve done that before. You pose a threat, and Alia wants the Imperium for her own—at least, the thing she has become wants this.”\n“How do I know this isn’t another Abomination speaking?” He shrugged. “That’s where your heart comes in. Ghani and | know how she fell. It isn’t easy to adjust to the clamor\nof that inner multitude. Suppress their egos and they will come crowding back every time you invoke a memory. One day—” He swallowed in a dry throat. “—a strong one from that inner pack decides it’s time to share the flesh.”\n“And there’s nothing you can do?” She asked the question although she feared the answer.\n“We believe there is something ... yes. We cannot succumb to the spice; that’s paramount. And we must not Suppress the past entirely. We must use it, make an amalgam of it. Finally we will mix them all into ourselves. We will no longer be our original selves—but we will not be possessed.”\n“You speak of a plot to abduct me.”\n“It’s obvious. Wensicia is ambitious for her son. Alia is ambitious for herself, and...”\n“Alia and Farad’n?”\n“That’s not indicated,” he said. “But Alia and Wensicia run parallel courses right now. Wensicia has a sister in Alia’s house. What simpler thing than a message to—”\n“You know of such a message?”\n“As though I’d seen it and read its every word.”\n“But you've not seen such a message?”\n“No need. | have only to know that the Atreides are all here together on Arrakis. All of the water in one cistern.” He gestured to encompass the planet.\n“House Corrino wouldn’t dare attack us here!”\n“Alia would profit if they did.” A sneer in his voice provoked her.\n“I won’t be patronized by my own grandson!” she said.\n“Then dammit, woman, stop thinking of me as your grandson! Think of me as your Duke Leto!” Tone and facial expression, even the abrupt hand gesture, were so exact that she fell silent in confusion.\nIn a dry, remote voice, Leto said: “I tried to prepare you. Give me that, at least.”\n“Why would Alia abduct me?”\n“To blame it on House Corrino, of course.”\n“| don’t believe it. Even for her, this would be... monstrous! Too dangerous! How could she do it without... | cannot believe this!”\n“When it happens, you'll believe. Ahh, grandmother, Ghani and | have but to eavesdrop within ourselves and we know. It's simple self-preservation. How else can we even guess at the mistakes being made around us?”\n“| do not for a minute accept that abduction is part of Alia’s—”\n“Gods below! How can you, a Bene Gesserit, be this dense? The whole Imperium suspects why you’re here. Wensicia’s propagandists are all prepared to discredit you. Alia can’t wait for that to happen. If you go down, House Atreides could suffer a mortal blow.”\n“What does the whole Imperium suspect?”\nShe measured out the words as coldly as possible, knowing she could not sway this unchi/d with any wile of Voice.\n“The Lady Jessica plans to breed those twins together!” he rasped. “That’s what the Sisterhood wants. Incest!”\nShe blinked. “Idle rumor.” She swallowed. “The Bene Gesserits will not let such a rumor run wild in the Imperium. We still have some influence. Remember that.”\n“Rumor? What rumor? You’ve certainly held your options open on interbreeding us.” He shook his head as she started to speak. “Don’t deny it. Let us pass puberty still living in the same household and you in that household, and your influence will be no more than a rag waved in the face of a sandworm.”\n“Do you believe us to be such utter fools?” Jessica asked.\n“Indeed I do. Your Sisterhood is nothing but a bunch of damn fool old women who haven't thought beyond their precious breeding program! Ghani and | know the leverage they have. Do you think us fools?”\n“Leverage?”\n“They know you’re a Harkonnen! It’ll be in their breeding records: Jessica out of Tanidia Nerus by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. That record accidentally made public would pull your teeth to—”\n“You think the Sisterhood would stoop to blackmail?”\n“|I know they would. Oh, they coated it sweetly. They told you to investigate the rumors about your daughter. They fed your curiosity and your fears. They invoked your sense of responsibility, made you feel guilty because you'd fled back to Caladan. And they offered you the prospect of saving your grandchildren.”\nJessica could only stare at him in silence. It was as though he’d eavesdropped on the emotional meetings with her Proctors from the Sisterhood. She felt completely subdued by his words, and now began to accept the possibility that he spoke truth when he said Alia planned abduction.\n“You see, grandmother, | have a difficult decision to make,” he said. “Do | follow the Atreides mystique? Do | live for my subjects... and die for them? Or do | choose another course—one which would permit me to live thousands of years?”\nJessica recoiled involuntarily. These words spoken so easily touched on a subject the Bene Gesserits made almost unthinkable. Many Reverend Mothers could choose that course... or try it. The manipulation of internal chemistry was available to initiates of the Sisterhood. But if one did it, sooner or later all would try it. There could be no concealing such an accumulation of ageless women. They knew for a certainty that this course would lead them to destruction. Short-lived humanity would turn upon them. No—it was unthinkable.\n“| don’t like the trend of your thoughts,” she said.\n“You don’t understand my thoughts,” he said. “Ghani and |...” He shook his head. “Alia had it in her grasp and threw it away.”\n“Are you sure of that? I’ve already sent word to the Sisterhood that Alia practices the unthinkable. Look at her! She’s not aged a day since last |...”\n“Oh, that!” He dismissed Bene Gesserit body balance with a wave of his hand. “I’m speaking of something else—a perfection of being far beyond anything humans have ever before achieved.”\nJessica remained silent, aghast at how easily he’d lifted her disclosure from her. He’d know surely that such a message represented a death sentence on Alia. And no matter how he changed the words, he could only be talking about committing the same offense. Didn’t he know the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and grandmother to Leto and Ghanima.
