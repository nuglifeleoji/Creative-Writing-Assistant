。田福堂并不因为自己身体的垮掉，就想连累她的儿女，不，他就是挣死在山里，也不能把润生叫回来种庄稼。娃娃正学开车，他不能耽误儿子的前程。另外，他也从不把他的病情告诉女儿。女儿有女儿的难肠事，不要再给她增加烦恼，每次给润叶回信的时候，他都说他一切都好着哩。他永远热爱和心疼自己的儿女，愿意他们一辈子活得畅快。他就是死，也要悄悄到一边去死，而不要让娃娃们为他牵肠挂肚…… \n　　如果目睹田福堂在土地上的挣扎，那真是够悲壮的了。干一会活，他就得停下来咳嗽半天，喘息半天。对他来说，这已经不是劳动，而是服苦役啊！ \n　　麦子刚收割完，庄稼人立刻抢农时开始耕种回茬荞麦了。 \n　　尽管田福堂又割麦又锄地，已经精疲力竭，但他还是挣扎着想种几亩荞麦。荞麦是好东西，清凉败火，伏天能做凉粉泄火气，还能剁面条，捻圪凸——信天游都唱“荞画圪凸羊腥汤，死死活活相跟上”哩！尤其是城里人，把荞麦面当作一种稀罕东西看待。田福堂想，他家门外工作人多，其它庄稼少种一点可以，但荞麦不种不行——这是他每年给城里的亲戚回敬的主要礼品。 \n　　但他单枪匹马，耕种这点荞麦实在是不容易啊！别人家都是一个人犁地，一个人在后面纳拌了籽种的肥料。他自己只好吆着牛犁到地头，再返回来端起粪斗，把籽种下进犁沟。 \n　　一个人干两个人的活，吃力不算，心里还急躁得不行！今天，眼看就要亮红晌午了，他仍然有两耙地没有种完。心一急，咳嗽就来了。这一次来得太猛烈，使他连吊在胸前的粪斗子都来不及解下，就一个马趴跌倒在犁沟里，没命地咳嗽起来。 \n　　咳嗽喘息长时间停歇不了。他几乎耗尽了身上的力气，伏在犁沟里怎么也爬不起来。连那只老黄牛在旁边看着他，眼睛里都充满了怜悯。 \n　　大半天功夫，田福堂才勉强从地上爬起来，把一脸泪水鼻涕揩掉。失神地望着剩下的那两耙地。他实在没有力量再种完这点地——可是这点地也确实再占不着他另来一趟了。该死的身体啊！ \n　　现在，田福堂愁眉苦脸地看见，别的庄稼人都已经卸了牛具，开始回家吃饭了。在他上面耕麦地的孙玉厚也扛起犁，吆着牛起身回家。孙玉厚下山时要从他这块地里经过，将要亲眼目睹他田福堂\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
