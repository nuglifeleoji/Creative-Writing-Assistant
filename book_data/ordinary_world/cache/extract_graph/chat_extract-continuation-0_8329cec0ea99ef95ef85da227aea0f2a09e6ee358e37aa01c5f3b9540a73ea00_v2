\n　　晓霞长久地望着那山湾。她看见，山湾里，坟堆前都立着墓碑。有几座新坟，生土在阳光下白得刺眼，上面飘曳着引魂幡残破不全的纸条。 \n　　“你……对自己有什么打算呢？”她小声问。 \n　　“我准备一辈子就在这里干下去……除此之外，还能怎样？” \n　　“这是理想，还是对命运的认同？” \n　　“我没有考虑那么全。我面对的只是我的现实。无论你怎样想入非非，但你每天得要钻入地下去挖煤。这就是我的现实。一个人的命运不是自己想改变就能改变了的。至于所谓理想，我认为这不是职业好坏的代名词。一个人精神是否充实，或者说活得有无意义，主要取决于他对劳动的态度。当然，这不是说我愿意牛马般受苦。我也感到井下的劳动太沉重。你一旦成为这个沉重世界里的一员，你的心绪就不可能只关注你自身……唉，咱们国家的煤炭开采技术是太落后了。如果你不嫌麻烦，我是否可以卖弄一下我所了解到的一些情况？” \n　　“你说！” \n　　“就我所知，我们国家全员工效平均只出０．９吨煤左右，而苏联、英国是２吨多，西德和波兰是３吨多，美国８吨多，澳大利亚是１０吨多。同样是开采露天矿，我国全员效率也不到２吨，而国外高达５０吨，甚至１００吨。在西德鲁尔矿区，那里的矿井生产都用电子计算机控制……“人就是这样，处在什么样的位置上，就对他的工作环境不仅关心，而且是带着一种感情在关心。正如你关心你们报纸一样，我也关心我们的煤矿。我盼望我们矿井用先进的工艺和先进的技术装备起来。但是，这一切首先需要有技术水平的人来实现，有了先进设备，可矿工大部分连字也不识，狗屁都不顶……对不起，我说了矿工的粗话……至于我自己，虽然高中毕业，可咱们那时没学什么，因此，我想有机会去报考局里办的煤炭技术学校。上这个学校对我是切实可行的。我准备一两年中一边下井干活，一边开始重学数、理、化，以便将来参加考试。这也许不是你说的那种理想，而是一个实际打算……” \n　　孙少平自己也没觉得，他一开口竟说了这么多。这使他自嘲地想：他的说话口才都有点象他们村的田福堂了！ \n　　晓霞一直用热切的目光望着他，用那只小手紧紧握着他的大手。 \n　　“还有什么‘实际打算’？”她笑着问。 \n　　“还有……一两年后，我想在双水村箍几孔新窑洞。”“那有啥必要呢？难道你象那些老干部一样，为了退休后落叶归根吗？”
