“没什么特别的，每天都过得很平凡。”\n    “那就好，刑警没来过？”\n    “最近都没看到，也没去店里。工藤先生那里呢？”\n    “嗯，也没来找我，看来嫌疑已经洗清了。”工藤把烟灰弹落于灰缸。“不过有件事有点怪。”\n    “怎么了？”\n    “嗯……”工藤露出迟疑的表情过了一会儿才开口，“老实说最近我常接到无声电话，都是打到我家里。”\n    “怎么会这样？好恐怖。”靖子皱眉。\n    “还有，”他略带踌躇地，从外套口袋取出一张便条纸。“信箱里还放了这种东西。”\n    靖子一看纸上的内容，不禁心头一跳，因为上面写着她的名字。内容如下：\n    “不准接近花冈靖子，能让她幸福的人不是你这种男人”\n    好像是用文字处理机或电脑打出来的，当然没写寄信人的名字。\n    “是邮差送来的？”\n    “不，好像是某人直接放进我的信箱。”\n    “你猜得出会是谁吗？”\n    “我毫无头绪，所以才想问问你。”\n    “我也想不出会是谁……”靖子把皮包拉过来，从里面取出手帕，她的掌心已开始冒汗。\n    “放进你信箱的，只有这封信？”\n    “不，还有一张照片。”\n    “照片？”\n    “是上次我去品川跟你碰面时的照片。好像是饭店的停车场被偷拍的，当时我完全没察觉。”工藤侧首不解。\n    靖子不由得环视周围，然而对方不可能从这个店内监视。\n    美里回来了，所以这个话题就此打住。一出了店，靖子母女就和工藤告别，坐上计程车。\n    “今晚的菜，很好吃吧？”靖子对女儿说。\n    但美里臭着脸不发一语。\n    “你一直那样板着脸，很没礼貌喔。”\n    “那你别带我来不就好了。我本来就说我不要来。”\n    “可是，人家一番好意非要邀请啊。”\n    “那你自己来不就好了，我下次再也不来了。”\n    靖子叹了一口气。工藤似乎深信只要时间久了美里自然会打开心房接纳他，但她觉得那显然毫无希望。\n    “妈，你要和那个人结婚吗？”美里突然问。\n    靖子从倚着的椅背上直起身子，“你胡说什么？”\n    “我是认真问你的，你们应该想结婚吧？”\n    “不会啦。”\n    “真的？”\n    “那当然，我们只是偶尔见见面。”\n    “那就好。”美里转向车窗。\n    “你想说什么？”\n    “没什么。”美里说完，缓缓转向靖子，“我只是觉得，如果背叛那个叔叔不太好。”\n    “你指的那个叔叔是……”\n    美里凝视母亲的眼睛，默默缩回下颚，似乎想说：就是隔壁的叔叔嘛。之所以没说出口，大概是怕计程车司机听见吧。\n    “你用不着在意那种事。”靖子再次靠回椅背。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>靖子<|>PERSON<|>靖子 is
