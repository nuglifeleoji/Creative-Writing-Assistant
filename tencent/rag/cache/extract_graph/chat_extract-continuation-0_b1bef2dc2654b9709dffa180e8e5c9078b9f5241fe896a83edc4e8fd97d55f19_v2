He wore it openly when he returned to his console.\nMy assigned position.\nHe did not try to hide his actions when he coded for the Ship’s ID circuits.\nAllies in Archives.\nThe circuits came flashing up on his projections—colored ribbons with a broken link into flight systems. The way around that breakage was visible after only a few moments’ study. Mentat observations had been prepared for it.\nMultiples through the core!\nIdaho sat back and waited.\nLift-off was a skull-rattling moment of blankness that stopped abruptly when they were far enough clear of the surface to engage nullfields and enter foldspace.\nIdaho watched his projection. There they were: the old couple in their garden setting! He saw the net shimmering in front of them, the man gesturing at it, smiling in round- faced satisfaction. They moved in a transparent overlay that revealed ship circuits behind them. The net grew larger—not lines but ribbons thicker than the projected circuits.\nThe man’s lips shaped words but there was no sound. “We expected you.”\nIdaho’s hands went to his console, fingers splayed in the comfield to grasp required elements of the circuit control. No time for niceties. Gross disruption. He was into the core within a second. From there, it was a simple matter to dump entire segments. Navigation went first. He saw the net begin to thin, the look of surprise on the man’s face. Nullfields were next. Idaho felt the ship lurching in foldspace. The net tipped, becoming elongated with the two watchers foreshortened and thinned. Idaho wiped out star-memory circuits, taking his own data with them.\nNet and watchers vanished.\nHow did I know they would be there?\nHe had no answer except a certainty rooted in the repeated visions.\nSheeana did not look up when he found her at the temporary flight-control board in the guard quarters. She was bent over the board, staring at it in consternation. The projection above her showed they had emerged from foldspace. Idaho recognized none of the visible star patterns but he had expected that.\nSheeana swiveled and looked at Garimi standing over her. “We've lost all data storage!”\nIdaho tapped his temple with a forefinger. “No we haven't.”\n“But it'll take years to recover even the essentials!” Sheeana protested. “What happened?”\n“We're an unidentifiable ship in an unidentifiable universe,” Idaho said. “Isn’t that what we wanted?”\nThere’s no secret to balance. You just have to feel the waves.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nM urbella felt that an age had passed since she recognized Duncan’s decision.\nVanish into space! Leave me!\nThe unvarying time sense of the Agony told her only seconds had elapsed since awareness of his intentions but she felt she had known this from the first.\nHe must be stopped!\nShe was reaching for her comboard when Central began to shudder. The quaking continued for an interminable time and subsided slowly.\nBellonda was on her feet. “What...”\n“The no-ship at the Flat has just lifted,” Murbella said.\nBellonda reached for the comboard but Murbella stopped her.\n“It's gone.” She must not see my pain. “But who...” Bellonda fell silent. She had her own\nassessments of consequences and saw then what Murbella Saw.\nMurbella sighed. She had all of the curses of history at her disposal and wanted none of them.\n“At lunchtime, | will eat in my private dining room with councillors and | want you present,” Murbella said. “Tell Duana oyster stew again.”\nBellonda started to protest but all that came out was: “Again?”\n“You will recall | ate alone downstairs last night?” Murbella resumed her seat.\nMother Superior has duties!\nThere were maps to change and rivers to follow and Honored Matres to domesticate.\nSome waves throw you, Murbella. But you get back up and go on with it. Seven times down, eight times up. You can balance on strange surfaces.\n| know, Dar. Willing participation in your dream.\nBellonda stared at her until Murbella said, “I made my councillors sit at a distance from me at dinner last night. It was strange—only the two tables in the whole dining room.”\nWhy do I continue this inane chatter? What excuses do | have for my extraordinary behavior?\n“We wondered why none of us were permitted in our own dining room,” Bellonda said.\n“To save your lives! But you should have seen their interest. | read their lips. Angelika said: ‘She’s eating some kind of stew. | heard her discussing it with the chef. Isn’t this a marvelous world we've acquired? We must sample that stew she ordered.’”\n“Samples,” Bellonda said. “I see.” Then: “You know, don’t you, Sheeana took the Van Gogh painting from. . . your sleeping chamber?”\nWhy does that hurt?\n“I noticed it was missing.”\n“Said she was borrowing it for her room in the ship.”\nMurbella’s lips went thin.\nDamn them! Duncan and Sheeana! Teg, Scytale... all of them gone and no way to follow. But we still have axlotl tanks and Idaho cells from our children. Not the same... but close. He thinks he’s escaped!\n“Are you all right, Murbella?” Concern in Bell’s voice.\nYou warned me about wild things, Dar, and I didn’t listen.\n“After we've eaten, | will take my councillors on an inspection tour of Central. Tell my acolyte l'Il want cider\nbefore retiring.”\nBellonda left, muttering. That was more like her.\nHow do you guide me now, Dar?\nYou want guidance? A guided tour of your life? Is that why | died?\nBut they took the Van Gogh, too!\nIs that what you’ll miss?\nWhy did they take it, Dar?\nCaustic laughter greeted this and Murbella was glad no one else heard.\nCan’t you see what she intends?\nThe Missionaria scheme!\nOh, more than that. It’s the next phase: Muad’Dib to Tyrant to Honored Matres to us to Sheeana... to what? Can’t you see it? The thing is right here at the lip of your thoughts. Accept it as you would swallow a bitter drink.\nMurbella shuddered.\nSee it? The bitter medicine of a Sheeana future? We once thought all medicines had to be bitter or they were not effective. No healing power in the sweet.\nMust it happen, Dar?\nSome will choke on that medicine. But the survivors may create interesting patterns.\nPaired opposites define your longings and those longings imprison you.\n— THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\nmm oe deliberately let them get away, Daniel!”\nThe old woman rubbed her hands down the stained front of her garden apron. It was a Summer morning around her, flowers blooming, birds calling from nearby trees. There was a misty look to the sky, a yellow radiance near the horizon.\n“Now, Marty, it was not deliberate,” Daniel said. He took off his porkpie hat and rubbed the bushy stubble of gray hair before replacing the hat. “He surprised me. | knew he Saw us but | didn’t suspect he saw the net.”\n“And | had such a nice planet picked out for them,” Marty said. “One of the best. A real test of their abilities.”\n“No use moaning about it,” Daniel said. “They're where we can’t touch them now. He was spread so thin, though, | expected to catch him easy.”\n“They had a Tleilaxu Master, too,” Marty said. “I saw him when they went under the net. | would have so liked to study another Master.”\n“Don’t see why. Always whistling at us, always making it necessary to stomp them down. | don’t like treating Masters that way and you know it! If it weren’t forthem.. .”\n“They’re not gods, Daniel.”\n“Neither are we.”\n“I still think you let them escape. You’re so anxious to prune your roses!”\n“What would you have said to the Master, anyway?” Daniel asked.\n“I was going to joke when he asked who we were. They always ask that. | was going to say: ‘What did you expect, God Himself with a flowing beard?’”\nDaniel chuckled. “That would’ve been funny. They have such a hard time accepting that Face Dancers can be independent of them.”\n“I don’t see why. It’s a natural consequence. They gave us the power to absorb the memories and experiences of other people. Gather enough of those and...”\n“It’s personas we take, Marty.”\n“Whatever. The Masters should’ve known we would gather enough of them one day to make our own decisions about our own future.”\n“And theirs?”\n“Oh, I'd have apologized to him after putting him in his place. You can do just so much managing of others, isn’t that right, Daniel?”\n“When you get that look on your face, Marty, | go prune my roses.” He went back to a line of bushes with verdant leaves and black blooms as large as his head.\nMarty called after him: “Gather up enough people and you get a big ball of knowledge, Daniel! That’s what I’d have told him. And those Bene Gesserit in that ship! I’d have told them how many of them | have. Ever notice how alienated they feel when we peek at them?”\nDaniel bent to his black roses.\nShe stared after him, hands on her hips.\n“Not to mention Mentats,” he said. “There were two of them on that ship—both gholas. You want to play with them?”\n“The Masters always try to control them, too,” she said.\n“That Master is going to have trouble if he tries to mess with that big one,” Daniel said, snipping off a ground shoot from the root stock of his roses. “My, this is a pretty one.”\n“Mentats, too!” Marty called. “I’d have told them. Dime a dozen, they are.”\n“Dimes? | don’t think they’d have understood that, Marty. The Reverend Mothers, yes, but not that big Mentat. He didn’t thin out that far back.”\n“You know what you let get away, Daniel?” she demanded, coming up beside him. “That Master had a nullentropy tube in his chest. Full of ghola cells, too!”\n“Tl saw it.”\n“That’s why you let them get away!”\n“Didn’t let them.” His pruning shears went snick-snick. “Gholas. He’s welcome to them.”\nHere is another book dedicated to Bev, friend, wife, dependable helper and the person who gave this one its title. The dedication is posthumous and the words below, written the morning after she died, should tell you something of her inspiration.\nO ne of the best things | can say about Bev is there was nothing in our life together | need forget, not even the graceful moment of her death. She gave me then the ultimate gift of her love, a peaceful passing she had spoken of without fear or tears, allaying thereby my own fears. What greater gift is there than to demonstrate you need not fear death?\nThe formal obituary would read: Beverly Ann Stuart Forbes Herbert, born October 20, 1926, Seattle, Washington; died 5:05 pm.
