His tragic past includes a scar from Beast Rabban on Giedi Prime, fueling his deep-seated vendetta against the Harkonnens.  \n\nHalleck served as Duke Leto Atreides' trusted lieutenant, participating in military strategy, security operations, and diplomatic missions. He was rescued by Duke Leto from a Harkonnen slave pit, reinforcing his fierce loyalty. A skilled baliset player, his music and poetry became part of Atreides cultural heritage, with his songs preserved in the Museum of Dar-es-Balat.  \n\nAfter the fall of House Atreides, Halleck survived by hiding among smugglers, later rejoining Paul during his rise as Muad'Dib. He played key roles in critical events, including triggering the Shield Wall explosion and advising Paul during the Fremen rebellion. His loyalty extended to Lady Jessica, whom he initially suspected of betrayal but later reconciled with, assisting her in Bene Gesserit-related tasks, including testing Leto II for signs of Abomination.  \n\nIn later years, Halleck served as an advisor to Leto II and Stilgar, though he harbored doubts about Leto's nature.
