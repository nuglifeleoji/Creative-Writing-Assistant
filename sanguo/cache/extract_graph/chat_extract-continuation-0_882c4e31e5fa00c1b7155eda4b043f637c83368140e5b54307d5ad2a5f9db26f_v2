早有探马报曹操，说张绣尽撤兵在西北角上，呐喊守城，东南却甚空虚。操曰：“中吾计矣！”遂命军中密备锹钁爬城器具。日间只引军攻西北角。至二更时分，却领精兵于东南角上爬过壕去，砍开鹿角。城中全无动静，众军一齐拥入。只听得一声炮响，伏兵四起。曹军急退，背后张绣亲驱勇壮杀来。曹军大败，退出城外，奔走数十里。张绣直杀至天明方收军入城。曹操计点败军，折兵五万余人，失去辎重无数。吕虔、于禁俱各被伤。却说贾诩见操败走，急劝张绣遗书刘表，使起兵截其后路。表得书，即欲起兵。忽探马报孙策屯兵湖口。蒯良曰：“策屯兵湖口，乃曹操之计也。今操新败，若不乘势击之，后必有患。”表乃令黄祖坚守隘口，自己统兵至安众县截操后路；一面约会张绣。绣知表兵已起，即同贾诩引兵袭操。\n\n    且说操军缓缓而行，至襄城，到清水，操忽于马上放声大哭。众惊问其故，操曰：“吾思去年于此地折了吾大将典韦，不由不哭耳！”因即下令屯住军马，大设祭筵，吊奠典韦亡魂。操亲自拈香哭拜，三军无不感叹。祭典韦毕，方祭侄曹安民及长子曹昂，并祭阵亡军士；连那匹射死的大宛马，也都致祭。次日，忽荀彧差人报说：“刘表助张绣屯兵安众，截吾归路。”操答彧书曰：“吾日行数里，非不知贼来追我；然吾计划已定，若到安众，破绣必矣。君等勿疑。”便催军行至安众县界。刘表军已守险要，张绣随后引军赶来。操乃令众军黑夜凿险开道，暗伏奇兵。及天色微明，刘表、张绣军会合，见操兵少，疑操遁去，俱引兵入险击之。操纵奇兵出，大破两家之兵。曹兵出了安众隘口，于隘外下塞。刘表、张绣各整败兵相见。表曰：“何期反中曹操奸计！”绣曰：“容再图之。”于是两军集于安众。且说荀彧探知袁绍欲兴兵犯许都，星夜驰书报曹操。操得书心慌，即日回兵。细作报知张绣，绣欲追之。贾诩曰：“不可追也，追之必败。”刘表曰：“今日不追，坐失机会矣\n######################\nOutput:",
