丁奉马军先到，见坛上执旗将士，当风而立。丁奉下马提剑上坛，不见孔明，慌问守坛将士。答曰：“恰才下坛去了。”丁奉忙下坛寻时，徐盛船已到。二人聚于江边。小卒报曰：“昨晚一只快船停在前面滩口。适间却见孔明披发下船，那船望上水去了。”丁奉、徐盛便分水陆两路追袭。徐盛教拽起满帆，抢风而使。遥望前船不远，徐盛在船头上高声大叫：“军师休去！都督有请！”只见孔明立于船尾大笑曰：“上覆都督：好好用兵；诸葛亮暂回夏口，异日再容相见。”徐盛曰：“请暂少住，有紧话说。”孔明曰：“吾已料定都督不能容我，必来加害，预先教赵子龙来相接。将军不必追赶。”徐盛见前船无篷，只顾赶来。看看至近，赵云拈弓搭箭，立于船尾大叫曰：“吾乃常山赵子龙也！奉令特来接军师。你如何来追赶？本待一箭射死你来，显得两家失了和气。——教你知我手段！”言讫，箭到处，射断徐盛船上篷索。那篷堕落下水，其船便横。赵云却教自己船上拽起满帆，乘顺风而去。其船如飞，追之不及。岸上丁奉唤徐盛船近岸，言曰：“诸葛亮神机妙算，人不可及。更兼赵云有万夫不当之勇，汝知他当阳长坂时否？吾等只索回报便了。”于是二人回见周瑜，言孔明预先约赵云迎接去了。周瑜大惊曰：“此人如此多谋，使我晓夜不安矣！”鲁肃曰：“且待破曹之后，却再图之。”\n\n

瑜从其言，唤集诸将听令。先教甘宁：“带了蔡中并降卒沿南岸而走，只打北军旗号，直取乌林地面，正当曹操屯粮之所，深入军中，举火为号。只留下蔡和一人在帐下，我有用处。”第二唤太史慈分付：“你可领三千兵，直奔黄州地界，断曹操合淝接应之兵，就逼曹兵，放火为号；只看红旗，便是吴侯接应兵到。”这两队兵最远，先发。第三唤吕蒙领三千兵去乌林接应甘宁，焚烧曹操寨栅，第四唤凌统领三千兵，直截彝陵界首，只看乌林火起，以兵应之。第五唤董袭领三千兵，直取汉阳，从汉川杀奔曹操案中。看白旗接应。第六唤潘璋领三千兵，尽打白旗，往汉阳接应董袭。六队船只各自分路去了。却令黄盖安排火船，使小卒驰书约曹操，今夜来降。一面拨战船四只，随于黄\n######################\nOutput:",
