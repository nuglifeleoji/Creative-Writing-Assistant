然哭了起来！张有智见状，立刻安慰这位下级说，县委知道这情况，罢了恨快会考虑他的问题……从县委书记家里出来，徐治功又立刻马不停蹄地返回到石圪节。 \n　　王彩娥打问着了他回来，很快设法向他通报“事情”已经完全风平浪静了！ \n　　徐治功对彩娥感激不已，高兴得几乎要哭一鼻子。但打这以后，他却再没胆量和这位大胆的女人交往了……没有多久，徐治功突然喜从天降，县委组织部下了文件，任命原副主任刘根民为石圪节公社主任，而把他调回县里任了令人羡慕的水电局局长。徐治功大为感慨地想：还是毛主席老人家说得对，坏事里面有好事哩！ \n                  第46章\n　　在我们亲爱的大地上，有多少朴素的花朵默默地开放在荒山野地里。 \n　　这花朵没有人注目。也许唯有自身才怜爱自身的芬芳。 \n　　可是，在我们普通人的生活中，在这平凡的世界里，也有多少绚丽的生命之花在悄然地开放而并不为我们所知啊！ \n　　但愿我们还没有忘记，不久前，田福堂的儿子田润生开着他姐夫的汽车，在外县一个庙会上偶然碰见了原西上高中时和他同班的女同学郝红梅；在目睹了丧夫携子的红梅在异乡的山村悲惨而不幸的生活后，这个身体瘦弱、不善言语的青年，便象个真正的男子汉一样，担负起帮助这位落难女同学的责任。我们知道，尽管他很快就遇到了世俗舆论的压力，但仍然毫不在乎地开着车来到这偏僻山庄，给生活于困境中的孤儿寡母送这送那，关怀备至……从那时到现在，田润生到郝红梅这里的奔波一直没有中断。 \n　　毫无疑问，开始的时候，润生这样慷慨地帮助红梅，纯粹出于一种同情心。从善良和对别人的同情心来说，田润生简直不象田福堂的儿子。 \n　　田润生这样跑了一段时间以后，他自己惊讶地发现：他的心情似乎发生了某种微妙的变化。 \n　　是啊，他强烈地意识到，他而今到红梅这里来，不再仅仅是要给她送一些维持生活的用品；而是渴望能见到她，坐在她的热炕头上，看着她亲切地侍候自己吃两碗香喷喷的细面条。尽管他长这么大，从没缺过吃喝，可他也从没吃过这么有滋味的面条。是的，那面条是很有滋味。但是，仅仅是有滋味的面条才使他如此留恋这地方吗？ \n　　不。他在这孔贫寒的窑洞里，那么多地体验了从来没有体验过的温暖。是的，温暖。心灵的温暖。他每次坐到这个土炕上，一路奔波所带来的紧张和劳累立刻就会消失得一干\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>张有智<|>PERSON<|>张有智
