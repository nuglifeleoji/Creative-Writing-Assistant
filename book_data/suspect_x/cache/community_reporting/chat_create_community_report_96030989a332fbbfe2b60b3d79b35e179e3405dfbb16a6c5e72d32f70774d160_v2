She is a powerful and violent ruler who opposes the Bene Gesserit, driven by a desire to destroy them and maintain absolute control. Known for her cruelty and dominance, she commands subordinates with an iron grip, often displaying her power through intimidation and interrogation.  \n\nHer interactions with key figures—such as Lucilla, Rebecca, Murbella, and Duncan—reveal her calculating and defensive leadership style. She interrogates Lucilla with a mix of curiosity and threat, showcasing her strategic thinking and control. When observing Murbella and Duncan, she exercises decisive authority, sparing Duncan by sending him to Rakis rather than allowing his execution. Additionally, she strategizes about **The Weapon** and potential threats like **Buzzell**, highlighting her role in shaping the Honored Matres' broader conflicts.  \n\nSurrounded by aides and councillors, the Great Honored Matre thrives on displays of power, reinforcing her position as a high-ranking and dangerous figure. Despite her violent tendencies, she is not impulsive; her actions are deliberate, aimed at consolidating her rule and eliminating opposition.

Despite their initial role as adversaries of the Honored Matres, they have been subjugated and repurposed by the same group they were meant to oppose.
