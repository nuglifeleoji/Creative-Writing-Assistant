He knew he had made her think. He was sure she had never before considered that any rights might adhere to uniqueness.\nHe addressed her silent scowl: “There has never before been a government exactly like mine. Not in all of our history. | am responsible only to myself, exacting payment in full for what | have sacrificed.”\n“Sacrificed!” she sneered, but he heard the doubts. “Every despot says something like that. You’re responsible only to yourself!”\n“Which makes every living thing my responsibility. | watch over you through these times.”\n“Through what times?”\n“The times that might have been and then no more.”\nHe saw the indecision in her. She did not trust her instincts, her untrained abilities at prediction. She might leap occasionally as she had done when she took his\njournals, but the motivation for the leap was lost in the revelation which followed.\n“My father says you can be very tricky with words,” she said.\n“And he ought to know. But there is knowledge you can only gain by participating in it. There’s no way to learn it by standing off and looking and talking.”\n“That’s the kind of thing he means,” she said.\n“You're quite right,” he agreed. “It’s not logical. But itis a light, an eye which can see, but does not see itself.”\n“I’m tired of talking,” she said.\n“As am |.” And he thought: / have seen enough, done enough. She is wide open to her doubts. How vulnerable they are in their ignorance!\n“You haven't convinced me of anything,” she said.\n“That was not the purpose of this meeting.”\n“What was the purpose?”\n“To see if you are ready to be tested.”\n“Test...” She tipped her head a bit to the right and stared at him.\n“Don’t play the innocent with me,” he said. “Moneo has told you. And | tell you that you are ready!”\nShe tried to swallow, then: “What are...”\n“| have sent for Moneo to return you to the Citadel,” he said. “When we meet again, we will really learn what you are made of.”\nYou know the myth of the Great Spice Hoard? Yes, | know about that story, too. A majordomo brought it to me one day to amuse me. The story says there is a hoard of melange, a gigantic hoard, big as a great mountain. The hoard is concealed in the depths of a distant planet. It is not Arrakis, that planet. It is not Dune. The spice was hidden there long ago, even before the First Empire and the Spacing Guild. The story says Paul Muad’Dib went there and lives yet beside the hoard, kept alive by it, waiting. The majordomo did not understand why the story disturbed me.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho trembled with anger as he strode along the gray\nplastone halls toward his quarters in the Citadel. At each guard post he passed, the woman there snapped to attention. He did not respond. Idaho knew he was causing disturbance among them. Nobody could mistake the Commander’s mood. But he did not abate his purposeful stride. The heavy thumping of his boots echoed along the walls.\nHe could still taste the noon meal—oddly familiar Atreides chopstick-fare of mixed grains herb-seasoned and baked around a pungent morsel of pseudomeat, all of it washed down with a drink of clear cidrit juice. Moneo had found him at table in the Guard Mess, alone in a corner with a regional operations schedule propped up beside his plate.\nWithout invitation, Moneo had seated himself opposite Idaho and had pushed aside the operations schedule.\n“I bring a message from the God Emperor,” Moneo said.\nThe tightly controlled tone warned Idaho that this was no casual encounter. Others sensed it. Listening silence settled over the women at nearby tables, spreading out through the room.\nIdaho put down his chopsticks. “Yes?”\n“These were the words of the God Emperor,” Moneo said. “It is my bad luck that Duncan Idaho should become enamored of Hwi Noree. This mischance must not continue.’”\nAnger thinned Idaho’s lips, but he remained silent.\n“Such foolishness endangers us all,” Moneo said. “Noree is the God Emperor’s intended.”\nIdaho tried to control his anger, but the words were a betrayal: “He can’t marry her!”\n“Why not?”\n“What game is he playing, Moneo?”\n“lam a messenger with a single message, no more,” Moneo said.\nIdaho’s voice was low and threatening. “But he confides in you.”\n“The God Emperor sympathizes with you,” Moneo lied.\n“Sympathizes!” Idaho shouted the word, creating a new depth to the room’s silence.\n“Noree is a woman of obvious attractions,” Moneo said. “But she is not for you.”\n“The God Emperor has spoken,” Idaho sneered, “and there is no appeal.”\n“I see that you understand the message,” Moneo said.\nIdaho started to push himself away from the table.\n“Where are you going?” Moneo demanded.\n“I’m going to have this out with him right now!”\n“That is certain suicide,” Moneo said.\nIdaho glared at him, aware suddenly of the listening intensity in the women at the tables around them. An expression which Muad’Dib would have recognized immediately came over Idaho’s face: “Playing to the Devil’s Gallery,” Muad’Dib had called it.\n“D’you know what the original Atreides Dukes always said?” Idaho asked. There was a mocking tone in his voice.\n“Is it pertinent?”\n“They said your liberties all vanish when you look up to any absolute ruler.”\nRigid with fear, Moneo leaned toward Idaho. Moneo’s lips barely moved. His voice was little more than a whisper. “Don’t say such things.”\n“Because one of these women will report it?”\nMoneo shook his head in disbelief. “You are more reckless than any of the others.”\n“Really?”\n“Please! It is perilous in the extreme to take this attitude.”\nIdaho heard the nervous stirring that swept through the room.\n“He can only kill us,” Idaho said.\nMoneo spoke in a tight whisper: “You fool! The Worm can dominate him at the slightest provocation!”\n“The Worm, you say?” Idaho’s voice was unnecessarily loud.\n“You must trust him,” Moneo said.\nIdaho glanced left and right. “Yes, | think they heard that.”\n“He is billions upon billions of people united in that one body,” Moneo said.\n“So I’ve been told.”\n“He is God and we are mortal,” Moneo said.\n“How is it a god can do evil things?” Idaho asked.\nMoneo thrust his chair backward and leaped to his feet. “l wash my hands of you!” Whirling away, he dashed from the room.\nIdaho looked out into the room, finding himself the center of attention for all of the guards’ faces.\n“Moneo doesn’t judge, but | do,” Idaho said.\nIt surprised him then to glimpse a few wry smiles among the women. They all returned to their eating.\nAs he strode down the hall of the Citadel, Idaho replayed the conversation, seeking out the oddities in Moneo’s behavior. The terror could be recognized and even\nunderstood, but it had seemed far more than fear of death... far, far more.\nThe Worm can dominate him.\nIdaho felt that this had slipped out of Moneo, an inadvertent betrayal. What could it mean?\nMore reckless than any of the others.\nIt galled Idaho that he should have to bear comparisons to himself-as-an-unknown. How careful had the others been?\nIdaho came to his own door, put a hand on the palm-lock and hesitated. He felt like a hunted animal retreating to his den. The guards in the mess surely would have reported that conversation to Leto by now. What would the God Emperor do? Idaho’s hand moved across the lock. The door swung inward. He entered the anteroom of his apartment and sealed the door, looking at it.\nWill he send his Fish Speakers for me?\nIdaho glanced around the entry area. It was a conventional space—racks for clothing and shoes, a full- length mirror, a weapons cupboard. He looked at the closed door of the cupboard. Not one of the weapons behind that door offered any real threat to the God Emperor. There wasn’t even a lasgun... although even lasguns were ineffectual against the Worm, according to all the accounts.\nHe knows | will defy him.\nIdaho sighed and looked toward the arched portal which led into the sitting area. Moneo had replaced the soft furniture with heavier, stiffer pieces, some of them recognizably Fremen—culled from the coffers of the Museum Fremen.\nMuseum Fremen!\nIdaho spat and strode through the portal. Two steps into the room he stopped, shocked. The soft light from the north windows revealed Hwi Noree seated on the low sling-divan. She wore a shimmering blue gown which draped itself revealingly around her figure. Hwi looked up at his entrance.\n“Thank the gods you’ve not been harmed,” she said.\nIdaho glanced back at his entry, at the palm-locked door. He returned a speculative look at Hwi. No one but a few selected guards should be able to open that door.\nShe smiled at his confusion. “We Ixians manufactured those locks,” she said.\nHe found himself filled with fear for her. “What are you doing here?”\n“We must talk.”\n“About what?”\n“Duncan...” She shook her head. “About us.”\n“They warned you,” he said.\n“I’ve been told to reject you.”\n“Moneo sent you!”\n“Two guardswomen who overheard you in the mess—they brought me. They think you are in terrible danger.”\n“Is that why you’re here?”\nShe stood, one graceful motion which reminded him of the way Leto’s grandmother, Jessica, had moved—the same fluid control of muscles, every movement beautiful.\nRealization came as a shock. “You're Bene Gesserit...”\n“No! They were among my teachers, but | am not Bene Gesserit.”\nSuspicions clouded his mind. What allegiances were really at work in Leto’s Empire? What does a ghola know about such things?\nThe changes since last I lived...\n“I suppose you're still just a simple Ixian,” he said.\n“Please don’t sneer at me, Duncan.”\n“What are you?”\n“lam the intended bride of the God Emperor\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>organization<|>The Ixians are a technologically advanced group who have given a gift to the God Emperor, which both strengthens and weakens him.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN EMBASSY<|>organization<|>The Ixian Embassy was attacked, indicating its presence and vulnerability in the political landscape.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>person<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a unique and absolute ruler who claims responsibility for all living things and governs without sharing or compromise.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>person<|>Hwi Noree is the intended bride of the God Emperor, described as having Bene Gesserit-like qualities but not being one.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>person<|>Duncan Idaho is a recurring character, a ghola who is enamored of Hwi Noree and defies the God Emperor.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>person<|>Moneo is a messenger and confidant of the God Emperor, who warns Duncan Idaho about the dangers of defying Leto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>geo<|>The Citadel is a location where significant events occur, including meetings and confrontations involving the God Emperor and his subjects.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>geo<|>Arrakis, also known as Dune, is a planet historically significant for its spice production, though the Great Spice Hoard is said to be elsewhere.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST EMPIRE<|>event<|>The First Empire is a historical period mentioned in the context of the Great Spice Hoard myth.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPACING GUILD<|>organization<|>The Spacing Guild is an organization with historical significance, mentioned in relation to the Great Spice Hoard.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL MUAD’DIB<|>person<|>Paul Muad’Dib is a historical figure associated with the myth of the Great Spice Hoard, said to be kept alive by it.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT SPICE HOARD<|>event<|>The Great Spice Hoard is a mythical cache of melange, said to be hidden on a distant planet and associated with Paul Muad’Dib.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>organization<|>The Bene Gesserit are a powerful group who trained Hwi Noree but are not her allegiance.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>IXIANS<|>The Ixians have given Leto a gift that both strengthens and weakens him.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>HWI NOREE<|>Hwi Noree is the intended bride of the God Emperor.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>HWI NOREE<|>Duncan Idaho is enamored of Hwi Noree, which causes conflict with Leto.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LETO<|>Duncan Idaho defies the God Emperor, risking severe consequences.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>LETO<|>Moneo serves as a messenger and confidant to the God Emperor.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Moneo warns Duncan Idaho about the dangers of defying Leto.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Hwi Noree was trained by the Bene Gesserit but is not one of them.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL MUAD’DIB<|>GREAT SPICE HOARD<|>Paul Muad’Dib is associated with the myth of the Great Spice Hoard.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT SPICE HOARD<|>FIRST EMPIRE<|>The Great Spice Hoard is said to predate the First Empire.<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT SPICE HOARD<|>SPACING GUILD<|>The Great Spice Hoard is said to predate the Spacing Guild.<|>4\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
