Described as having a sullen voice, he operates the advanced interrogation device, adjusting pain levels and closely observing Teg's reactions during the process. YAR is known to suggest extreme measures in the course of his duties, indicating a ruthless or uncompromising approach to his role. His primary function revolves around the use of the T-probe, a tool designed to extract information or manipulate subjects through controlled pain and sensory feedback. Collectively, the descriptions portray YAR as a cold, methodical interrogator, focused on his task with little regard for the subject's well-being.  \n\nThe summaries align in depicting YAR as a key operator of the T-probe, emphasizing his direct involvement in Teg's interrogation. While one description highlights his vocal demeanor (\"\"sullen voice\"\"), another underscores his technical role in adjusting pain levels, reinforcing his hands-on control over the process. The mention of \"\"extreme measures\"\" suggests a willingness to escalate interrogation tactics, further solidifying his reputation as a severe and unyielding figure.  \n\nIn summary, YAR is a male interrogator who employs the T-probe as his primary tool, meticulously monitoring and manipulating Teg's responses. His demeanor is characterized by a sullen tone, and his methods are marked by a readiness to employ harsh measures, painting him as a formidable and relentless functionary in his field.\",5\n1786,FUNCTIONARY,\"The **FUNCTIONARY** is an unnamed official involved in the interrogation of Teg.
