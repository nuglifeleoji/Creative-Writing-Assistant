It controls interstellar commerce, including the highly lucrative spice melange trade from Arrakis, as well as other commodities like pongi rice and technology. CHOAM operates as a universal development corporation, heavily influenced by political forces, with the Emperor, Great Houses, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit as key stakeholders—some as silent partners.  \n\nOnce a dominant economic force in the Old Empire, CHOAM remains a persistent and influential faction, though some view it as a defunct or fragmented relic, nostalgically remembered. Its profits are deeply tied to the spice trade, making it a central player in power struggles, particularly involving the Atreides Empire. Despite its economic might, CHOAM is often criticized for its inability to foster genuine loyalties or understand human motivations, relying instead on cold commercial and political maneuvering.  \n\nThe organization has been involved in conflicts with Paul Atreides, with factions within CHOAM opposing his rule, as evidenced by the \"\"CHOAM minority\"\" note. It also employs a vast network of functionaries, including minor officials like Loschy Teg and Teg’s father. Additionally, CHOAM maintains a shadowy presence, with spies reportedly embedded even within Bene Gesserit ranks.  \n\nIn summary, CHOAM is a cornerstone of the Imperium’s economy, wielding immense influence over trade and politics, yet it remains a contentious entity—both revered for its power and scrutinized for its impersonal, profit-driven nature. Its role in controlling the spice trade ensures its continued relevance in the ever-shifting balance of power across the universe.\",29\n96,MELANGE,\"**MELANGE**, also known as **spice**, is the most valuable substance in the universe, central to the economy, culture, and survival of countless civilizations. Found exclusively on the desert planet **Arrakis**, melange is harvested from the sands and is intrinsically linked to the giant sandworms that inhabit the region. Its production and trade form the backbone of a universe-spanning economic and political system, with control over Arrakis and its spice reserves being a source of immense power.  \n\nMelange is essential for **space travel**, as it grants **Guild Navigators** the prescient abilities required to safely fold space and traverse vast interstellar distances. Beyond navigation, the spice is prized for its life-extending properties and its capacity to enhance mental and physical abilities. The **Bene Gesserit** utilize melange in their rituals and training, as it unlocks heightened awareness and psychic potential.  \n\nAmong the inhabitants of Arrakis, melange is a vital resource for trade and survival, sought after by villagers and merchants alike. Its rarity and indispensability make it a catalyst for conflict, as factions vie for control over its production. Universally coveted, melange is not only a commodity but a transformative force, shaping the destiny of individuals and empires alike.  \n\nIn summary, melange is a multifaceted substance: a key to interstellar travel, a tool for mental and physical enhancement, a driver of galactic politics, and a lifeline for those who depend on its trade. Its significance cannot be overstated—it is the foundation upon which the universe’s power structures are built.\",15\n932,ESSAS PAYMON,\"Essas Paymon is a CHOAM spy captured by Alia, later executed for plotting against her\"\"\",3\n715,IXIAN CONFEDERACY,The Ixian Confederacy is a political entity that offers submission to Paul's rule but questions the Imperial Tax and seeks a constitution to limit his power.,1\n1330,STAR JEWELS,\"A CHOAM cartel project generating substantial profits, offsetting losses elsewhere>\",1\n682,IMPERIAL CITIZENS,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n163,CHOAM,MELANGE,CHOAM’s profits are heavily dependent on spice production and trade,44\n2049,ESSAS PAYMON,CHOAM,Essas Paymon was a spy for CHOAM,32\n1571,IXIAN CONFEDERACY,CHOAM,\"The Ixian Confederacy's trade depends on Guild transport, which is tied to CHOAM's economic power.\",30\n3005,CHOAM,STAR JEWELS,CHOAM's regional cartel in Star Jewels yielded major profits,30\n1460,MELANGE,IMPERIAL CITIZENS,Citizens are addicted to melange and would die without it,16\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
