Once known as Shuloch, it was historically a haunted place where great crimes were committed, but it has since transformed into a tranquil settlement. The village features stone buildings and narrow streets, where residents such as Irti and her family live.  \n\nGOYGOA also serves as a safe haven for Idaho and Siona, who are quartered in a Guest House. Leto considers the area secure, reinforcing its reputation as a sheltered and hospitable location. The combination of its scenic landscape—lush hills and cultivated orchards—along with its storied past and present serenity, makes GOYGOA a unique blend of history and renewal.  \n\nDespite its dark history as Shuloch, the village now thrives as a quiet, agrarian community, offering refuge and stability to its inhabitants. The contrasting descriptions—of its haunted past and its current peacefulness—highlight its transformation over time, with no remaining contradictions in its present state.

The settlement is an enclosed desert basin, home to a mix of ancient and modern traditions, where inhabitants utilize ornithopters and spice harvesters while maintaining Fremen customs.  \n\nShuloch holds significant narrative importance as the site of pivotal events, including Leto Atreides II's early transformation and his eventual escape. It is also tied to key figures such as Gurney Halleck, who collaborates with the Cast Out there, and Assan Tariq, who originates from Shuloch but is unable to return. The settlement is further linked to interactions involving Leto, Sabiha, and Muriz, as well as being the destination of The Preacher.  \n\nHistorically, Shuloch was once known as *Goygoa*, meaning \"\"haunted place,\"\" due to its dark past as the site of great crimes before its original inhabitants were eradicated.
