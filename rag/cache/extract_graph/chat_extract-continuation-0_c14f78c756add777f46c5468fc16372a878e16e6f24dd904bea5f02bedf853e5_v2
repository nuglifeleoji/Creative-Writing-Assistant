Well. . . silence could be met with silence.\nIdaho peered down at the passing landscape. Here and there he could see the clustered lights of villages winking out as the sunlight approached. The desert of the Sareer lay far behind and this was land that, by its appearance, might never have been parched.\nSome things do not change very much, he thought. They are merely taken from one place and reformed in another place.\nThis landscape reminded him of Caladan’s lush gardens and made him wonder what had become of the verdant\nplanet where the Atreides had lived for so many generations before coming to Dune. He could identify narrow roads, market roads with a scattered traffic of vehicles drawn by six-legged animals which he guessed were thorses. Moneo had said that thorses tailored to the needs of sucha landscape were the main work beasts not only here but throughout the Empire.\n“A population which walks is easier to control.”\nMoneo’s words rang in Idaho’s memory as he peered downward. Pastureland appeared ahead of the 'thopter, softly rolling green hills cut into irregular patterns by black stone walls. Idaho recognized sheep and several kinds of large cattle. The ‘thopter passed over a narrow valley still in gloom and with only a hint of the water coursing down its depths. A single light and a blue plume of smoke lifting out of the valley’s shadows spoke of human occupation.\nSiona suddenly stirred and tapped their pilot on the shoulder, pointing off to the right ahead of them.\n“Isn't that Goygoa over there?” Siona asked.\n“Yes.” Inmeir spoke without turning, her voice clipped and touched by some emotion which Idaho could not identify.\n“Is that not a safe place?” Siona asked.\n“It is safe.”\nSiona looked at Idaho. “Order her to take us to Goygoa.”\nWithout knowing why he complied, Idaho said: “Take us to that place.”\nInmeir turned then and her features, which Idaho had thought a square block of non-emotion during the night, revealed the clear evidence of some deep feeling. Her mouth was drawn down into a scowl. A nerve twitched at the corner of her right eye.\n“Not Goygoa, Commander,” Inmeir said. “There are better...”\n“Did the God Emperor tell you to take us to a specific place?” Siona demanded.\nInmeir glared her anger at this interruption, but did not look directly at Siona. “No, but He...”\n“Then take us to this Goygoa,” Idaho said.\nInmeir jerked her attention back to the ‘thopter’s controls and Idaho was thrown against Siona as the craft banked Sharply and flew toward a round pocket nestled in the green hills.\nIdaho peered over Inmeir’s shoulder to look at their destination. At the very center of the pocket lay a village built of the same black stones as the surrounding fences. Idaho saw orchards on some of the slopes above the village, terraced gardens rising in steps toward a small saddle where hawks could be seen gliding on the day’s first\nupdrafts. Looking at Siona, Idaho asked: “What is this Goygoa?” “You will see.”\nInmeir set the ’thopter into a shallow glide which brought them to a gentle landing on a flat stretch of grass at the edge of the village. One of the Fish Speakers opened the door on the village side. Idaho’s nostrils were immediately assaulted by a heady mixture of aromas—crushed grass, animal droppings, the acridity of cooking fires. He slipped out of the ’thopter and looked up a village street where people were emerging from their houses to stare at the visitors. Idaho saw an older woman in a long green dress bend over and whisper something to a child who immediately turned and went dashing away up the street.\n“Do you like this place?” Siona asked. She dropped down beside him.\n“It appears pleasant.”\nSiona looked at Inmeir as the pilot and the other Fish Speakers joined them on the grass. “When do we go back to Onn?”\n“You do not go back,” Inmeir said. “My orders are to take you to the Citadel. The Commander goes back.”\n“I see.” Siona nodded. “When will we leave?”\n“At dawn tomorrow. | will see the village leader about quarters.” Inmeir strode off into the village.\n“Goygoa,” Idaho said. “That’s a strange name. | wonder what this place was in the Dune days?”\n“I happen to know,” Siona said. “It is on the old charts as Shuloch, which means ‘haunted place.’ The Oral History Says great crimes were committed here before all of the inhabitants were wiped out.”\n“Jacurutu,” Idaho whispered, recalling the old legends of the water stealers. He glanced around, looking for the evidence of dunes and ridges; there was nothing—only two older men with placid faces returning with Inmeir. The men wore faded blue trousers and ragged shirts. Their feet were bare.\n“Did you know this place?” Siona asked.\n“Only as a name in a legend.”\n“Some say there are ghosts,” she said, “but | do not believe it.”\nInmeir stopped in front of Idaho and motioned the two barefooted men to wait behind her. “The quarters are poor but adequate,” she said, “unless you would care to stay in one of the private residences.” She turned and looked at Siona as she said this.\n“We will decide later,” Siona said. She took Idaho’s arm. “The Commander and | wish to stroll through Goygoa and admire the sights.”\nInmeir shaped her mouth to speak, but remained silent.\nIdaho allowed Siona to lead him past the peering faces of the two local men.\n“I will send two guards with you,” Inmeir called out.\nSiona stopped and turned. “Is it not safe in Goygoa?”\n“It is very peaceful here,” one of the men said.\n“Then we will not need guards,” Siona said. “Have them guard the ’thopter.”\nAgain, she led Idaho toward the village.\n“All right,” Idaho said, disengaging his arm from Siona’s grasp. “What is this place?”\n“It is very likely that you will find this a very restful place,” Siona said. “It is not like the old Shuloch at all. Very peaceful.”\n“You're up to something,” Idaho said, striding beside her. “What is it?”\n“I’ve always heard that gholas were full of questions,” Siona said. “I, too, have questions.”\n“Oh?”\n“What was he like in your day, the man Leto?”\n“Which one?”\n“Yes, | forget there were two—the grandfather and our Leto. | mean our Leto, of course.”\n“He was just a child, that’s all | know.”\n“The Oral History says one of his early brides came from this village.”\n“Brides? | thought...”\n“When he still had a manly shape. It was after the death of his sister but before he began to change into the Worm. The Oral History says the brides of Leto vanished into the maze of the Imperial Citadel, never to be seen again except as faces and voices transmitted by holo. He has not had a bride for thousands of years.”\nThey had arrived at a small square at the center of the village, a Space about fifty meters on a side and with a low- walled pool of clear water in its center. Siona crossed to the pool’s wall and sat on the rock ledge, patting beside her for Idaho to join her there. Idaho looked around at the village first, noting how people peered out at him from behind curtained windows, how the children pointed and whispered. He turned and stood looking down at Siona.\n“What is this place?”\n“I’ve told you. Tell me what Muad’Dib was like.”\n“He was the best friend a man could ever have.”\n“So the Oral History is true, but it calls the caliphate of his heirs The Desposyni, and that has an evil sound.”\nShe’s baiting me, Idaho thought.\nHe allowed himself a tight smile, wondering at Siona’s motives. She appeared to be waiting for some important event, anxious ... even dreading .. . but with an undertone of something like elation. It was all there. Nothing she said now could be accounted as more than small talk, a way of occupying the moments until... until what?\nThe light sound of running feet intruded on his reverie. Idaho turned and saw a child of perhaps eight years racing toward him out of a side street. The child’s bare feet kicked up little dust geysers as he ran and there was the sound of a woman shouting, a despairing sound somewhere up the street. The runner stopped about ten paces away and stared up at Idaho with a hungering look, an intensity which Idaho found disturbing. The child appeared vaguely familiar—a boy, a stalwart figure with dark curly hair, an unfinished face but with hints of the man to be—rather high cheekbones, a flat line across the brows. He wore a faded blue singlesuit which betrayed the effects of much laundering but obviously had begun as a garment of excellent material. It had the look of punji cotton woven ina cordlock that did not permit even the frayed edges to unravel.\n“You're not my father,” the child said. Whirling away, he raced back up the street and vanished around a corner.\nIdaho turned and scowled at Siona, almost afraid to ask the question: Was that a child of my predecessor? He knew the answer without asking—that familiar face, the genotype carried true. Myself as a child. Realization left him with an empty feeling, a sense of frustration. What is my responsibility?\nSiona put both hands over her face and hunched her shoulders. It had not happened at all the way she had imagined it might. She felt betrayed by her own desires for\nrevenge. Idaho was not simply a ghola, something alien and unworthy of consideration. She had felt him thrown against her in the ‘thopter, had seen the obvious emotions on his face. And that child...\n“What happened to my predecessor?” Idaho asked. His voice came out flat and accusatory.\nShe lowered her hands. There was suppressed rage in his face.\n“We are not certain,” she said, “but he entered the Citadel one day and never emerged.”\n“That was his child?”\nShe nodded.\n“You're sure you did not kill my predecessor?”\n“I...” She shook her head, shocked by the doubts, the latent accusation in him.\n“That child, that is the reason we came here?”\nShe swallowed. “Yes.”\n“What am | supposed to do about him?”\nShe shrugged, feeling soiled and guilty because of her own actions.\n“What about his mother?” Idaho asked.\n“She and the others live up that street.” Siona nodded in the direction the boy had gone.\n“Others?”\n“There is an older son ...a daughter. Will you... 1 mean, | could arrange...”\n“No! The boy was right. I’m not his father.”\n“I’m sorry,” Siona whispered. “I should not have done this.”\n“Why did he choose this place?” Idaho asked.\n“The father... your...”\n“My predecessor!”\n“Because this was Irti’s home and she would not leave. That is what people said.”\n“Irti... the mother?”\n“Wife, by the old rite, the one from the Oral History.”\nIdaho looked around at the stone fronts of the buildings which\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a character who accompanies Idaho and has knowledge of the Oral History and the village of Goygoa.
