He was outraged. The old Naib there understood the problems being raised by all of this plotting, but nobody else knew a damned thing about the situation!\nGhanima smiled grimly, said: “Tell him, Farad’n.”\nFarad’n sighed. It was easy to forget the strangeness of this child who was not a child. He could imagine a lifetime married to her, the hidden reservations on every intimacy. It was not a totally pleasant prospect, but he was beginning to recognize its inevitability. Absolute control of dwindling spice supplies! Nothing would move in the universe without the spice.\n“Later, Tyek,” Farad’n said.\n“But—”\n“Later, | said!” For the first time, he used Voice on Tyekanik, saw the man blink with surprise and remain silent.\nA tight smile touched Jessica’s mouth.\n“He talks of peace and death in the same breath,” Stilgar muttered. “Golden Age!”\nGhanima said: “He’ll lead humans through the cult of death into the free air of exuberant life! He speaks of death because that’s necessary, Stil. It’s a tension by which the living know they’re alive. When his Empire falls .. . Oh, yes, it’ll fall. You think this is Kralizec now, but Kralizec is yet to come. And when it comes, humans will have renewed their memory of what it’s like to be alive. The memory will persist as long as there’s a single human living. We’ll go through the crucible once more, Stil. And we'll come out of it. We always arise from our own ashes. Always.”\nFarad’n, hearing her words, understood now what she’d meant in telling him about Leto running. He'll not be human.\nStilgar was not yet convinced. “No more worms,” he growled.\n“Oh, the worms will come back,” Ghanima assured him. “All will be dead within two hundred years, but they'll come back.”\n“How...” Stilgar broke off.\nFarad’n felt his mind awash in revelation. He knew what Ghanima would say before she spoke.\n“The Guild will barely make it through the lean years, and only then because of its stockpiles and ours,” Ghanima said. “But there’ll be abundance after Kralizec. The worms will return after my brother goes into the sand.”\nAs with so many other religions, Muad’Dib’s Golden Elixir of Life degenerated into external wizardry. Its mystical signs became mere symbols for deeper psychological processes, and those processes, of course, ran wild. What they needed was a living god, and they didn’t have one, a situation which Muad’Dib’s son has corrected.\n—SAYING ATTRIBUTED TO LU TUNG-PIN (LU, THE GUEST OF THE CAVERN)\nBes sat on the Lion Throne to accept the homage of the tribes. Ghanima stood beside him, one step down. The ceremony in the Great Hall went on for hours. Tribe after Fremen tribe passed before him through their delegates and their Naibs. Each group bore gifts fitting for a god of terrifying powers, a god of vengeance who promised them peace.\nHe’d cowed them into submission the previous week, performing for the assembled arifa of all the tribes. The Judges had seen him walk through a pit of fire, emerging unscathed to demonstrate that his skin bore no marks by asking them to study him closely. He’d ordered them to strike him with knives, and the impenetrable skin had sealed his face while they struck at him to no avail. Acids ran off him with only the lightest mist of smoke. He’d eaten their poisons and laughed at them.\nAt the end he’d summoned a worm and stood facing them at its mouth. He’d moved from that to the landing field at Arrakeen, where he’d brazenly toppled a Guild frigate by lifting one of its landing fins.\nThe arifa had reported all of this with a fearful awe, and now the tribal delegates had come to seal their submission.\nThe vaulted space of the Great Hall with its acoustical dampening systems tended to absorb sharp noises, but a constant rustling of moving feet insinuated itself into the senses, riding on dust and the flint odors brought in from the open.\nJessica, who'd refused to attend, watched from a high spy hole behind the throne. Her attention was caught by Farad’n and the realization that both she and Farad’n had been outmaneuvered. Of course Leto and Ghanima had anticipated the Sisterhood! The twins could consult within themselves a host of Bene Gesserits greater than all now living in the Empire.\nShe was particularly bitter at the way the Sisterhood’s mythology had trapped Alia. Fear built on fear! The habits of generations had imprinted the fate of Abomination upon her. Alia had known no hope. Of course she’d succumbed. Her fate made the accomplishment of Leto and Ghanima even more difficult to face. Not one way out of the trap, but two. Ghanima’s victory over the inner lives and her insistence that Alia deserved only pity were the bitterest things of all. Hypnotic suppression under stress linked to the wooing of a benign ancestor had saved Ghanima. They might have saved Alia. But without hope, nothing had been attempted until it was too late. Alia’s water had been poured upon the sand.\nJessica sighed, shifted her attention to Leto on the throne. A giant canopic jar containing the water of Muad’Dib occupied a place of honor at his right elbow. He’d boasted to Jessica that his father-within laughed at this gesture even while admiring it.\nThat jar and the boasting had firmed her resolve not to participate in this ritual. As long as she lived, she knew she could never accept Paul speaking through Leto’s mouth. She rejoiced that House Atreides had survived, but the things- that-might-have-been were beyond bearing.\nFarad’n sat cross-legged beside the jar of Muad’Dib’s water. It was the position of the Royal Scribe, an honor newly conferred and newly accepted.\nFarad’n felt that he was adjusting nicely to these new realities although Tyekanik still raged and promised dire consequences. Tyekanik and Stilgar had formed a partnership of distrust which seemed to amuse Leto.\nIn the hours of the homage ceremony, Farad’n had gone from awe to boredom to awe. They were an endless stream of humanity, these peerless fighting men. Their loyalty renewed to the Atreides on the throne could not be questioned. They stood in submissive terror before him, completely daunted by what the arifa had reported.\nAt last it drew to a close. The final Naib stood before Leto —Stilgar in the “rearguard position of honor.” Instead of panniers heavy with spice, fire jewels, or any of the other costly gifts which lay in mounds around the throne, Stilgar bore a headband of braided spice-fiber. The Atreides Hawk had been worked in gold and green into its design.\nGhanima recognized it and shot a sidewise glance at Leto.\nStilgar placed the headband on the second step below the throne, bowed low. “I give you the headband worn by your sister when | took her into the desert to protect her,” he said.\nLeto suppressed a smile.\n“I know you've fallen on hard times, Stilgar,” Leto said. “Is there something here you would have in return?” He gestured at the piles of costly gifts.\n“No, My Lord.”\n“| accept your gift then,” Leto said. He rocked forward, brought up the hem of Ghanima’s robe, ripped a thin strip from it. “In return, | give you this bit of Ghanima’s robe, the robe she wore when she was stolen from your desert camp, forcing me to save her.”\nStilgar accepted the cloth in a trembling hand. “Do you mock me, My Lord?”\n“Mock you? By my name, Stilgar, never would | mock you. | have given you a gift without price. | command you to carry it always next to your heart as a reminder that all humans are prone to error and all leaders are human.”\nA thin chuckle escaped Stilgar. “What a Naib you would have made!”\n“What a Naib | am! Naib of Naibs. Never forget that!”\n“As you say, My Lord.” Stilgar swallowed, remembering the report of his arifa. And he thought: Once I thought of slaying him. Now it’s too late. His glance fell on the jar, a graceful opaque gold capped with green. “That is water of my tribe.”\n“And mine,” Leto said. “| command you to read the inscription upon its side. Read it aloud that all may hear it.”\nStilgar cast a questioning glance at Ghanima, but she returned it with a lift of her chin, a cold response which sent a chill through him. Were these Atreides imps bent on holding him to answer for his impetuosity and his mistakes?\n“Read it,” Leto said, pointing.\nSlowly Stilgar mounted the steps, bent to look at the jar. Presently he read aloud: “This water is the ultimate essence, a source of outward streaming creativity. Though motionless, this water is the means of all movement.”\n“What does it mean, My Lord?” Stilgar whispered. He felt awed by the words, touched within himself in a place he could not understand.\n“The body of Muad’Dib is a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect,” Leto said. “He mastered the inner world while holding the outer in contempt, and this led to catastrophe. He mastered the outer world while excluding the inner world, and this delivered his descendants to the demons. The Golden Elixir will vanish from Dune, yet Muad’Dib’s seed goes on, and his water moves our universe.”\nStilgar bowed his head. Mystical things always left him in turmoil.\n“The beginning and the end are one,” Leto said. “You live in air but do not see it. A phase has closed. Out of that closing grows the beginning of its opposite. Thus, we will have Kralizec. Everything returns later in changed form. You have felt thoughts in your head; your descendants will feel thoughts in their bellies. Return to Sietch Tabr, Stilgar. Gurney Halleck will join you there as my advisor in your Council.”\n“Don’t you trust me, My Lord?” Stilgar’s voice was low.\n“Completely, else I’d not send Gurney to you. He’ll begin recruiting the new force we'll need soon. | accept your pledge of fealty, Stilgar. You are dismissed.”\nStilgar bowed low, backed off the steps, turned and left the hall. The other Naibs fell into step behind him according to the Fremen principle that “the last shall be first.” But some of their queries could be heard on the throne as they departed.\n“What were you talking about up there, Stil? What does that mean, those words on Muad’Dib’s water?”\nLeto spoke to Farad’n. “Did you get all of that, Scribe?”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FARAD’N<|>PERSON<|>Farad’n is a prince involved in political and military discussions, showing strategic insight and leadership qualities>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TYEKANIK<|>PERSON<|>Tyekanik is a military figure with strong opinions, often outraged and distrustful of others' decisions>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is a child with profound wisdom, involved in high-stakes political and spiritual discussions, and a key figure in the Atreides legacy>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Bene Gesserit with deep emotional and strategic involvement in the Atreides family's affairs>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen Naib, a leader of his tribe, and a figure of loyalty and conflict within the Atreides regime>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a god-like figure on the throne, possessing supernatural abilities and a deep connection to the Atreides legacy>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SARDaukar<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are a feared military force, previously under Farad’n's control>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with deep political and mystical influence>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a desert people with a strong tribal and warrior culture>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Guild is a powerful organization controlling space travel and spice commerce>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KRALIZEC<|>EVENT<|>Kralizec is a prophesied apocalyptic event, a time of great upheaval and transformation>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN AGE<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Age refers to a period of peace and prosperity, often discussed in contrast to impending chaos>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>GEO<|>Arrakeen is a city on Dune, a significant location for political and military events>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen settlement, a home and stronghold for Stilgar and his tribe>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>TYEKANIK<|>Farad’n and Tyekanik have a military and advisory relationship, with Tyekanik often challenging Farad’n's decisions<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>GHANIMA<|>Farad’n and Ghanima are engaged in political and possibly marital negotiations, with deep strategic implications<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>LETO<|>Ghanima and Leto are twins with a shared destiny and deep mystical connection<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>LETO<|>Jessica is Leto's grandmother, with a complex emotional and strategic relationship<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>LETO<|>Stilgar is a loyal yet conflicted follower of Leto, with a mix of awe and resistance<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Leto has outmaneuvered the Bene Gesserit, using their own mythology against them<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FREMEN<|>Leto commands the Fremen's loyalty through awe and supernatural demonstrations<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>KRALIZEC<|>Leto is a central figure in the prophesied event of Kralizec<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>KRALIZEC<|>Ghanima speaks prophetically about Kralizec and its aftermath<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>SIETCH TABR<|>Stilgar is the Naib of Sietch Tabr, his home and stronghold<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>SARDaukar<|>Farad’n previously controlled the Sardaukar, a key military force<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
