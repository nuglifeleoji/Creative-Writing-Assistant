却说先主是夜心惊肉颤，寝卧不安。出帐仰观天文，见西北一星，其大如斗，忽然坠地。先主大疑，连夜令人求问孔明。孔明回奏曰：“合损一上将。三日之内，必有惊报。”先主因此按兵不动。忽侍臣奏曰：“阆中张车骑部将吴班，差人赍表至。”先主顿足曰：“噫！三弟休矣！”及至览表，果报张飞凶信。先主放声大哭，昏绝于地。众官救醒。\n\n    次日，人报一队军马骤风而至。先主出营观之。良久，见一员小将，白袍银铠，滚鞍下马，伏地而哭，乃张苞也。苞曰：“范疆、张达杀了臣父，将首级投吴去了！”先主哀痛至甚，饮食不进。群臣苦谏曰：“陛下方欲为二弟报仇，何可先自摧残龙体？”先主方才进膳，遂谓张苞曰：“卿与吴班，敢引本部军作先锋，为卿父报仇否？”苞曰：“为国为父，万死不辞！”先主正欲遣苞起兵，又报一彪军风拥而至。先主令侍臣探之。须臾，侍臣引一小将军，白袍银铠，入营伏地而哭。先主视之，乃关兴也。先主见了关兴，想起关公，又放声大哭。众官苦劝。先主曰：“朕想布衣时，与关、张结义，誓同生死；今朕为天子，正欲与两弟同享富贵，不幸俱死于非命！见此二侄，能不断肠！”言讫又哭。众官曰：“二小将军且退。容圣上将息龙体。”侍臣奏曰：“陛下年过六旬，不宜过于哀痛。”先主曰：“二弟俱亡，朕安忍独生！”言讫，以头顿地而哭。\n\n    多官商议曰：“今天子如此烦恼，将何解劝？”马良曰：“主上亲统大兵伐吴，终日号泣，于军不利。”陈震曰：“吾闻成都青城山之西，有一隐者，姓李，名意。世人传说此老已三百余岁，能知人之生死吉凶，乃当世之神仙也。何不奏知天子，召此老来，问他吉凶，胜如吾等之言。”遂入奏先主。先主从之，即遣陈震赍诏，往青城山宣召。震星夜到了青城，令乡人引入出谷深处，遥望仙庄，清云隐隐，瑞气非凡。忽见一小童来迎曰：“来者莫非陈孝起乎？”震大惊曰：“仙童如何知我姓字！”童子曰：“吾师昨者有言：今日必有皇帝诏命至；使者必是陈孝起。”震曰：“真神仙也！人言信不诬矣！”遂与小童同入仙庄，拜见李意，宣天子诏命。李意推老不行。震曰：“天子急欲见仙翁一面，幸勿吝鹤驾。”再三敦请，李意方行。即至\n######################\nOutput:",
