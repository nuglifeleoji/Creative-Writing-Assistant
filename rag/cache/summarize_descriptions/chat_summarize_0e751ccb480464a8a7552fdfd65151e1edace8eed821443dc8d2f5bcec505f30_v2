The assailant used the small, deadly weapon to stealthily target Paul, but he managed to survive by immobilizing himself, preventing the device from detecting his movements. After outmaneuvering the hunter-seeker, Paul ultimately destroyed it, thwarting the assassination attempt. The attack highlights the use of advanced, concealed weaponry in the political and military conflicts of the era, as well as Paul's quick thinking and resilience in the face of danger.  \n\nBoth descriptions agree on the nature of the attack—a hunter-seeker device was deployed to kill Paul—and confirm his survival through his strategic response.
