These major roads have been the site of unusual occurrences, including reports of snakes appearing during various events. Such incidents highlight the unpredictable nature of these thoroughfares.\n\nIn addition to their role in civilian transportation, 公路 also function as significant geographical features for military operations. Military vehicles are actively utilizing these roads, which are being cleared to ensure smooth movement and logistics. This dual purpose underscores the importance of highways not only for everyday travel but also for strategic military maneuvers.\n\nDespite their essential role, the functionality of 公路 has been compromised in certain areas. Some sections of the highway system remain intact; however, they are obstructed by abandoned vehicles.
