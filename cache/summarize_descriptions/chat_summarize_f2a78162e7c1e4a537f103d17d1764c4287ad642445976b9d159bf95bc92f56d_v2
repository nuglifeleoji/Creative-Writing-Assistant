Patrin assisted Teg in training Duncan and played a crucial role in their defense against the Face Dancer attack, demonstrating his steadfast loyalty. Their relationship extended beyond duty, as Teg frequently noted Patrin’s physical resemblance to Gammu natives, suggesting a shared genetic history.  \n\nPatrin’s knowledge and experiences were invaluable to Teg, particularly regarding the no-globe complex, from which Teg learned much. One notable memory Teg held was Patrin’s first encounter with the no-globe’s access tube, highlighting their deep connection. Tragically, Patrin sacrificed himself as a decoy to ensure Teg’s escape, an act of selflessness that Teg deeply grieved. Their bond was one of mutual respect and camaraderie, forged through years of shared trials and unwavering trust.  \n\nIn summary, Patrin was not only Teg’s devoted subordinate but also a trusted comrade whose sacrifices and insights left a lasting impact on Teg.
