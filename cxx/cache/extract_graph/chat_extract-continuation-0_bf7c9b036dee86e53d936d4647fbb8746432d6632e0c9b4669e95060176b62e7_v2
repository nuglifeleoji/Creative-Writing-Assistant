＜＝Ａ?Ｒ↑2.5\n　　Y 为可抵抗SLER的机体成长时间，单位为小时；R为辐射剂量，单位为拉德。A为一个小于1的系数，因生物种类而定，人类的A为0.39。SLER在生物界并不普遍，研究者们进行了大量的生物试验，目前为止，只发现黑色挪威鼠和罗猴身上出现过SLER.\n　　SLER是人类所有的疾病中唯一真正的不治之症，因为它的实质是人类的生命之链基因被完全破坏，在可预见的未来，拯救SLER患者生命的唯一办法只能是把他（她）的全部记忆和意识移植到一个新的身体或人造机体中。但我们大可不必对SLER感到恐惧，因为导致它的辐射强度只在核战争时才会出现，而对于核战争，我们应该是有信心制止的！\n　　两个孩子抬起头，默默地对视着，他们的脑海中同时浮现出在火车上看到的那个午夜太阳和那个发出绿色荧光的世界.\n　　3月2日凌晨，地球处在死星的高能宇宙射线的飓风之中。高能粒子如暴雨般冲击着地球大气层，它们中83%是氢原子核，15%是氦核，1%是电子，剩下1%是种类繁多的重元素粒子。这粒子洪流的很大一部分被地球磁场沿范?艾伦辐射带偏转到两极，又有很大一部分被大气顶部的臭氧层挡住，但仍有对人类来说是致命的数量射入大气层。这些携带着惊人能量的接近光速的宇宙粒子不会直接到达地面，它们就象冰雹穿过大树一样在疯狂地撞击着大气粒子，产生了次级和次次级射线，使得大地和海洋笼罩在密密的射线暴雨中！\n　　当人们从睡梦中醒来时，成群的高能粒子正以难以想象的速度穿过他们的躯体，穿过组成躯体的每个细胞。细胞中那微小的染色体，如一根根晶莹而脆弱的游丝在高能粒子的弹雨中颤抖挣扎，DNA 双螺旋分子链被撕开，碱基四下飞散。受伤的基因仍在继续工作，但经过几千万年进化的精确的生命之链已被扭曲击断，已变异的基因现在不是复制生命而是播撒死亡了。后来，死星的可见光虽然消失了，但它的高能射线仍源源不断地射来，地球在旋转，使它背向死星的部分也被照射到了，全人类经历了一场他们感觉不到的死亡淋浴.\n　　华华首先从发呆中醒过来，他又拿起了那条打印纸带，\"咱们从这个公式中，可以算出多大的人才能活下来.\"他说着拾起一支铅笔把那个公式抄到那条打印纸的背面.\n　　Ｙ
