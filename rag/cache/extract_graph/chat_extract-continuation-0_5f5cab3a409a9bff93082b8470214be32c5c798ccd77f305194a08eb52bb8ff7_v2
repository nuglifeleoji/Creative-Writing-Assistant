And although she knew there were embassies of other powers on Rakis, the Bene Gesserit spies among her attendants made sure that Sheeana did not express too much interest in the Sisterhood. Soothing answers to dampen such interest were provided and metered out to Sheeana as required.\nThe message from Taraza to her observers on Rakis was direct and pointed: “The generations of preparation have become the years of refinement. We will move only at the proper moment. There is no longer any doubt that this child is the one.”\nIn my estimation, more misery has been created by reformers than by any other force in human history. Show me someone who says, “Something must be done!” and I will show you a head full of vicious intentions that have no other outlet. What we must strive for always! is to find the natural flow and go with it.\n—THE REVEREND MOTHER TARAZA, CONVERSATIONAL RECORD, BG FILE GSXXMAT9\nhe overcast sky lifted as the sun of Gammu climbed, picking up the scents of grass and surrounding forest extracted and condensed by the morning dampness.\nDuncan Idaho stood at a Forbidden Window inhaling the smells. This morning Patrin had told him: “You are fifteen years of age. You must consider yourself a young man. You no longer are a child.”\n“Is it my birthday?”\nThey were in Duncan’s sleeping chamber where Patrin had just aroused him with a glass of citrus juice.\n“I do not know your birthday.”\n“Do gholas have birthdays?”\nPatrin remained silent. It was forbidden to speak of gholas with the ghola.\n“Schwangyu says you can’t answer that question,” Duncan said.\nPatrin spoke with obvious embarrassment. “The Bashar wishes me to tell you that your training class will be delayed this morning. He wishes you to do the leg and knee exercises until you are called.”\n“I did those yesterday!”\n“I merely convey the Bashar’s orders.” Patrin took the empty glass and left Duncan alone.\nDuncan dressed quickly. They would expect him for breakfast in the Commissary. Damn them! He did not need their breakfast. What was the Bashar doing? Why couldn’t he start the classes on time? Leg and knee exercises! That was just make-work because Teg had some other unexpected duty. Angrily, Duncan took a Forbidden Route to a Forbidden Window. Let the damned guards be punished!\nHe found the odors coming through the open window evocative but could not place the memories that lurked at the edges of his awareness. He knew there were memories. Duncan found this frightening but magnetic—like walking along the edge of a cliff or openly confronting Schwangyu with his defiance. He had never walked along the edge of a cliff nor openly confronted Schwangyu with defiance, but he could imagine such things. Just seeing a filmbook holophoto of a cliff-edge path was enough to make his stomach tighten. As for Schwangyu, he often imagined angry disobedience and suffered the same physical reaction.\nSomeone else is in my mind, he thought.\nNot just in his mind—/n his body. He could sense other experiences as though he had just awakened, knowing he had dreamed but unable to recall the dream. This dream- stuff called up knowledge that he knew he could not possess.\nYet he did possess it.\nHe could name some of the trees he smelled out there but those names were not in the library’s records.\nThis Forbidden Window was forbidden because it pierced an outer wall of the Keep and could be opened. It was often open, as now, for ventilation. The window was reached from his room by climbing over a balcony rail and slipping through a storeroom air shaft. He had learned to do this without the slightest disturbance of rail or storeroom or Shaft. Quite early, it had been made clear to him that those trained by the Bene Gesserit could read extremely small\nsigns. He could read some of those signs himself, thanks to the teachings of Teg and Lucilla.\nStanding well back in the shadows of the upper hallway, Duncan focused on rolling slopes of forest climbing to rocky pinnacles. He found the forest compelling. The pinnacles beyond it possessed a magical quality. It was easy to imagine that no human had ever touched that land. How good it would be to lose himself there, to be only his own person without worrying that another person dwelled within him. A stranger there.\nWith a sigh, Duncan turned away and returned to his room along his secret route. Only when he was back in the safety of his room did he allow himself to say that he had done it once more. No one would be punished for this venture.\nPunishments and pain, which hung like an aura around the places forbidden to him, only made Duncan exercise extreme caution when he broke the rules.\nHe did not like to think of the pain Schwangyu would cause him if she discovered him at a Forbidden Window. Even the worst pain, though, would not cause him to cry out, he told himself. He had never cried out even at her nastier tricks. He merely stared back at her, hating her but absorbing her lesson. To him, Schwangyu’s lesson was direct: Refine his ability to move unobserved, unseen and unheard, leaving no spoor to betray his passage.\nIn his room, Duncan sat on the edge of his cot and contemplated the blank wall in front of him. Once, when he had stared at that wall, an image had formed there—a young woman with light amber hair and sweetly rounded features. She looked out of the wall at him and smiled. Her lips moved without sound. Duncan already had learned lip reading, though, and he read the words clearly.\n“Duncan, my sweet Duncan.”\nWas that his mother? he wondered. His real mother?\nEven gholas had real mothers somewhere back there. Lost in the time behind the axlotl tanks there had been a living woman who bore him and... and loved him. Yes, loved him because he was her child. If that face on the wall was his mother, how had her image found its way there? He could not identify the face but he wanted it to be his mother.\nThe experience frightened him but fear did not prevent him from wanting to repeat it. Whoever that young woman was, her fleeting presence tantalized him. The stranger within him knew that young woman. He felt sure of this. Sometimes, he wanted to be that stranger only for an instant—long enough to gather up all of those hidden memories—but he feared this desire. He would lose his real self, he thought, if the stranger entered his awareness.\nWould that be like death? he wondered.\nDuncan had seen death before he was six. His guards had repelled intruders and one of the guards was killed. Four intruders died as well. Duncan had watched the five bodies brought into the Keep—flaccid muscles, arms dragging. Some essential thing was gone from them. Nothing remained to call up memories—self-memories or stranger- memories.\nThe five were taken somewhere deep within the Keep. He heard a guard say later that the four intruders were loaded with “shere.” That was his first encounter with the idea of an Ixian Probe.\n“An Ixian Probe can raid the mind even of a dead person,’ Geasa explained. “Shere is a drug that protects you from the probe. Your cells will be totally dead before the drug effect is gone.”\nAdroit listening told Duncan the four intruders were being probed in other ways as well. These other ways were not explained to him but he suspected this must be something secret to the Bene Gesserit. He thought of it as another hellish trick of the Reverend Mothers. They must animate the dead and extract information from the unwilling flesh.\nr\nDuncan visualized depersonalized muscles performing at the will of a diabolical observer.\nThe observer was always Schwangyu.\nSuch images filled Duncan’s mind despite every effort by his teachers to dispel “foolishness invented by the ignorant.” His teachers said these wild stories were valuable only to create fear of the Bene Gesserit among the uninitiated. Duncan refused to believe that he was of the initiated. Looking at a Reverend Mother he always thought: I’m not one of them!\nLucilla was most persistent lately. “Religion is a source of energy,” she said. “You must recognize this energy. It can be directed for your own purposes.”\nTheir purposes, not mine, he thought.\nHe imagined his own purposes and projected his own images of himself triumphant over the Sisterhood, especially over Schwangyu. Duncan felt that his imaginative projections were a subterranean reality that worked on him from that place where the stranger dwelled. But he learned to nod and give the appearance that he, too, found such religious credulity amusing.\nLucilla recognized the dichotomy in him. She told Schwangyu: “He thinks mystical forces are to be feared and, if possible, avoided. As long as he persists in this belief he cannot learn to use our most essential knowledge.”\nThey met for what Schwangyu called “a regular assessment session,” just the two of them in Schwangyu’s study. The time was shortly after their light supper. The sounds of the Keep around them were those of transition— night patrols beginning, off-duty personnel enjoying one of their brief free-time periods. Schwangyu’s study had not been completely insulated from such things, a deliberate contrivance of the Sisterhood’s renovators. The trained senses of a Reverend Mother could detect many things from the sounds around her.\nSchwangyu felt more and more at a loss in these “assessment sessions.” It was increasingly obvious that Lucilla could not be won over to those opposing Taraza. Lucilla also was immune to a Reverend Mother’s manipulative subterfuges. Most damnable of all, Lucilla and Teg between them were imparting highly volatile abilities to the ghola. Dangerous in the extreme. Added to all of her other problems, Schwangyu nurtured a growing respect for Lucilla.\n“He thinks we use occult powers to practice our arts,” Lucilla said. “How did he arrive at such a peculiar idea?”\nSchwangyu felt the disadvantage imposed by this question. Lucilla already knew this had been done to weaken the ghola. Lucilla was saying: “Disobedience is a crime against our Sisterhood!”\n“If he wants our knowledge, he will surely get it from you,” Schwangyu said. No matter how dangerous, in Schwangyu’s view, this was certainly a truth.\n“His desire for knowledge is my best lever,” Lucilla said, “but we both know that is not enough.” There was no reproof in Lucilla’s tone but Schwangyu felt it nevertheless.\nDamn her! She’s trying to win me over! Schwangyu thought.\nSeveral responses entered Schwangyu’s mind: “/ have not disobeyed my orders.” Pah! A disgusting excuse! “The ghola has been treated according to standard Bene Gesserit training practices.” Inadequate and untrue. And this ghola was not a standard object of education. There were depths in him that could only be matched by a potential Reverend Mother. And that was the problem!\n“| have made mistakes,” Schwangyu said.\nThere! That was a double-pronged answer that another Reverend Mother could appreciate.\n“You made no mistake when you damaged him,” Lucilla said.\n“But | failed to anticipate that another Reverend Mother might expose the flaws in him,” Schwangyu said.\n“He wants our powers only to escape us,” Lucilla said. “He’s thinking: Someday l'Il know as much as they do and then l'Il run away.”\nWhen Schwangyu did not respond, Lucilla said: “That was clever\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHAITAN<|>PERSON<|>Shaitan is a character whose behavior is being analyzed, possibly a significant figure in the narrative\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is a planet where embassies of other powers are located and where significant events involving Sheeana and the Bene Gesserit take place\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a child of interest to the Bene Gesserit, possibly central to their plans, and is monitored by their spies\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with spies, manipulative tactics, and deep knowledge, involved in training and controlling key individuals\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is a Reverend Mother who sends direct messages about Sheeana and the Bene Gesserit's plans\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is a planet with forests and a sun, where Duncan Idaho resides\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola, a young man with hidden memories and abilities, trained by the Bene Gesserit and others\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Patrin is a figure who interacts with Duncan Idaho, conveying orders and information\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Schwangyu is a Reverend Mother who opposes Taraza and is involved in Duncan Idaho's training, often causing him pain\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a Bashar who trains Duncan Idaho and is involved in his education\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILLA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a Reverend Mother who teaches Duncan Idaho and works with Teg, opposing Schwangyu's methods\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN PROBE<|>EVENT<|>The Ixian Probe is a technology or event involving the extraction of information from dead persons, mentioned in the context of Duncan's experiences\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Sheeana is monitored and controlled by the Bene Gesserit, who dampen her interest in them<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>SHEEANA<|>Taraza identifies Sheeana as a key figure in the Bene Gesserit's plans<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SCHWANGYU<|>Duncan Idaho is trained and punished by Schwangyu, whom he fears and resents<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TEG<|>Duncan Idaho is trained by Teg, who imparts knowledge and skills to him<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LUCILLA<|>Duncan Idaho is taught by Lucilla, who works to refine his abilities and understanding<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>LUCILLA<|>Schwangyu and Lucilla are in conflict over the training and treatment of Duncan Idaho<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is a Reverend Mother who directs the Bene Gesserit's plans and actions<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>IXIAN PROBE<|>Duncan Idaho learns about the Ixian Probe and its implications for the dead<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>GAMMU<|>Duncan Idaho resides on Gammu and interacts with its environment<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>RAKIS<|>Sheeana is on Rakis, where the Bene Gesserit monitors her<|>8\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
