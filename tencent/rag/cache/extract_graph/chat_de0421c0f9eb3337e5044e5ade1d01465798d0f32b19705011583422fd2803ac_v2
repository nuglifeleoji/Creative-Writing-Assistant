This had a heavy influence on Effectiveness and that, in turn, ruled Consequences. A good Mother Superior could wend her way through decision mazes in seconds. Liveliness in Central then. Eyes brightened. Word was passed that “She acted without hesitation.” That created confidence among acolytes and other students. Reverend Mothers (Proctors especially) waited to assess Consequences.\nOdrade spoke to her reflection in the window as much as to Bellonda. “Even Mother Superior must take her own time.”\n“But what has you in such turmoil?”\n“Are you urging speed, Bell?”\nBellonda drew back in her chairdog as though Odrade had pushed her.\n“Patience is extremely difficult in these times,” Odrade said. “But choosing the right moment influences my choices.”\n“What do you intend with our new Teg? That’s the question you must answer.”\n“If our enemies removed themselves from Gammu, where would they go, Bell?”\n“You would attack them there?”\n“Push them a bit.”\nBellonda spoke softly. “That’s a dangerous fire to feed.”\n“We need another bargaining chip.”\n“Honored Matres don’t bargain!”\n“But their associates do, | think. Would they remove themselves to... let us say, Junction?”\n“What is so interesting about Junction?”\n“Honored Matres are based there in force. And our beloved Bashar kept a memory-dossier of the place in his lovely Mentat mind.”\n“Ohhhhhhh.” It was as much a sigh as a word.\nTamalane entered then and demanded attention by standing silently until Odrade and Bellonda looked at her.\n“The Proctors support Mother Superior.” Tamalane held up a clawed finger. “By one vote!”\nOdrade sighed. “Tell us, Tam, the Proctor | greeted in the hallway, Praska, how did she vote?”\n“She voted for you.”\nOdrade aimed a tight smile at Bellonda. “Send out spies and agents, Bell. We must goad the hunters into meeting us on Junction.”\nBell will deduce my plan by morning.\nWhen Bellonda and Tamalane had gone, muttering to each other, worry in the sound of their voices, Odrade went out into the short corridor to her private quarters. The corridor was patrolled by its usual acolytes and Reverend Mother servitors. A few acolytes smiled at her. So word of the Proctors’ vote had reached them. Another crisis passed.\nOdrade went through her sitting room to her sleeping cell, where she stretched out on her cot fully clothed. One glow- globe bathed the room in pale yellow light. Her gaze went past the desert map to the Van Gogh painting in its protective frame and cover on the wall at the foot of her cot.\nCottages at Cordeville.\nA better map than the one marking the growth of the desert, she thought. Remind me, Vincent, of where | came from and what I yet may do.\nThis day had drained her. She had gone beyond fatigue into a place where the mind caught itself in tight circles.\nResponsibilities!\nThey hemmed her in and she knew she could be her most disagreeable self when beset by duties. Forced to expend\nenergy just maintaining a semblance of calm demeanor. Bell saw this in me. It was maddening. The Sisterhood was cut off at every passage, made almost ineffectual.\nShe closed her eyes and tried to construct an image of an Honored Matre commander to address. Old... steeped in power. Sinewy. Strong and with that blinding speed they have. No face on her but the visualized body stood there in Odrade’s mind.\nForming the words silently, Odrade spoke to the faceless Honored Matre.\n“It is difficult for us to let you make your own mistakes. Teachers always find this hard. Yes, we consider ourselves teachers. We do not so much teach individuals as the species. We provide lessons for all. If you see the Tyrant in us, you are right.”\nThe image in her mind made no reply.\nHow could teachers teach when they could not emerge from hiding? Burzmali dead, ghola Teg an unknown quantity. Odrade felt invisible pressures converging on Chapterhouse. No wonder Proctors voted. A web enclosed the Sisterhood. The strands held them tightly. And somewhere on that web, a faceless Honored Matre commander crouched.\nSpider Queen.\nHer presence was known by actions of her minions. A trap strand of her web trembled and attackers hurled themselves onto entangled victims, insanely violent, uncaring how many of their own died or how many they butchered.\nSomeone commanded the search: Spider Queen.\nIs she sane by our standards? Into what awful perils have | sent Dortujla?\nHonored Matres went beyond megalomania. They made the Tyrant appear a ridiculous pirate by comparison. Leto Il, at least, had known what the Bene Gesserit knew: how to balance on the point of the sword, aware that you would be mortally cut when you slid from that position. The price you pay for seizing such power. Honored Matres ignored this\ninevitable fate, hewing and slashing around them like a giant in the throes of terrible hysteria.\nNothing ever before had opposed them successfully and they chose to respond now with the killing rage of berserkers. Hysteria by choice. Deliberate.\nBecause we left our Bashar on Dune to spend his pitiful force in a suicidal defense? No telling how many Honored Matres he killed. And Burzmali at the death of Lampadas. Surely, the hunters felt his sting. Not to mention Idaho- trained males we send out to pass along Honored Matre techniques of sexual enslavement. And to men!\nWas that enough to bring such rage? Possibly. But what of the stories from Gammu? Did Teg display a new talent that terrified Honored Matres?\nIf we restore our Bashar’s memories, we must watch him carefully.\nWould a no-ship contain him?\nWhat really made Honored Matres so reactive? They wanted blood. Never bring such people bad news. No wonder their minions behaved with frenzy. A powerful person in fright might kill the bearer of bad tidings. Bring no bad tidings. Better to die in battle.\nSpider Queen’s people went beyond arrogance. Far beyond. No censure possible. You might just as well berate a cow for eating grass. The cow would be justified in looking at you with its moon struck eyes, inquiring: “Isn’t this what l'm supposed to do?”\nKnowing probable consequences, why did we ignite them? We aren't like the person who hits out at a round gray object with a stick and finds that the object was a hornet’s nest. We knew what we struck. Taraza’s plan and none of us questioned.\nThe Sisterhood faced an enemy whose deliberate policy was hysterical violence. “We will run amok!”\nAnd what would happen if Honored Matres met painful defeat? What would their hysteria become?\nI fear it.\nDid the Sisterhood dare feed this fire?\nWe must!\nSpider Queen would redouble her efforts to find Chapterhouse. Violence would escalate to an even more repulsive stage. What then? Would Honored Matres suspect everyone and anyone of being sympathetic to the Bene Gesserit? Might they not turn against their own supporters? Did they contemplate being alone in a universe devoid of other sentient life? More likely this did not even enter their minds.\nWhat do you look like, Spider Queen? How do you think?\nMurbella said she did not know her supreme commander or even sub-commanders of her Hormu Order. But Murbella provided a suggestive description of a sub-commander’s quarters. Informative. What does a person call home? Who does she keep close to share life’s little homilies?\nMost of us choose our companions and surroundings to reflect ourselves.\nMurbella said: “One of her personal servants took me into the private area. Showing off, demonstrating that she had access to the sanctum. The public area was neat and clean but the private rooms were messy—clothing left where it had been dropped, unguent jars open, bed unmade, food drying in dishes on the floor. | asked why they had not cleaned up this mess. She said it was not her job. The one who cleaned was allowed into the quarters just before nightfall.”\nSecret vulgarities.\nSuch a one would have a mind to match that private display.\nOdrade’s eyes snapped open. She focused on the Van Gogh painting. My choice. It put tensions on the long span of human history that Other Memory could not. You sent me a message, Vincent. And because of you, I will not cut off\nmy ear...orsend useless love messages to ones who do not care. That’s the least | can do to honor you.\nThe sleeping cell had a familiar odor, peppery pungency of carnation. Odrade’s favorite floral perfume. Attendants kept it here as a nasal background.\nOnce more, she closed her eyes and her thoughts Snapped back to Spider Queen. Odrade felt this exercise creating another dimension to that faceless woman.\nMurbella said an Honored Matre commander had but to give an order and anything she wanted was brought.\n“Anything?”\nMurbella described known instances: grossly distorted sexual partners, cloying sweetmeats, emotional orgies ignited by performances of extraordinary violence.\n“They’re always looking for extremes.”\nReports of spies and agents fleshed out Murbella’s semi- admiring accounts.\n“Everyone says they have a right to rule.”\nThose women evolved from an autocratic bureaucracy. Much evidence confirmed it. Murbella spoke of history lessons that said early Honored Matres conducted research\nto gain sexual dominance over their populations “when taxation became too threatening to those they governed.”\nA right to rule?\nIt did not appear to Odrade that these women insisted on such a right. No. They assumed that their rightness must never be questioned. Never! No decisions wrong. Disregard consequences. It never happened.\nOdrade sat upright on her cot, knowing she had found the insight she sought.\nMistakes never happen.\nThat would require an extremely large bag of unconsciousness to contain it. Very tiny consciousness then peering out at a tumultuous universe they themselves created!\nOhhhh, lovely!\nOdrade summoned her night attendant, a first-stage acolyte, and asked for melange tea containing a dangerous stimulant, something to help her delay the body’s demands for sleep. But at a cost.\nThe acolyte hesitated before obeying. She returned ina moment with the mug steaming on a small tray.\nOdrade had decided long ago that melange tea made with the deep cold water of Chapterhouse had a taste that worked its way into her psyche. The bitter stimulant deprived her of that refreshing taste and gnawed at her conscience. Word would go out from the ones who watched. Worry, worry, worry. Would Proctors take another vote?\nShe sipped slowly, giving the stimulant time to work. Condemned woman rejects last dinner. Sips tea.\nPresently, she put aside the empty mug and called for warm clothing. “I’m going for a walk in the orchards.” The night attendant made no comment. Everyone knew she often went walking there, even at night.\nWithin minutes she was in the narrow, link-fenced path to her favorite orchard, her way lighted by a miniglobe fixed on a short cord to her right shoulder. A small herd of the Sisterhood’s black cattle came up to the fence beside Odrade and gazed at her as she passed. She looked at the wet muzzles, inhaled the rich smell of alfalfa in the steam of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_de0421c0f9eb3337e5044e5ade1d01465798d0f32b19705011583422fd2803ac_v2"}
