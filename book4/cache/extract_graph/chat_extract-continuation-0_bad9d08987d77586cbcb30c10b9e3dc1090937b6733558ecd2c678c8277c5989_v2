刘玉升，穿着那件麻绳子纳的破棉袄也闻讯赶来。他立在人群里一言不发，只是神秘地微笑着，似乎证实他那可怕的预言终于应验了——哼，我早就说过，那池子里会养出鱼精的！ \n　　海民夫妇万万没有想到，他们打算用来笼络人心的鱼，现在却为他们招致了一片怨骂声。银花气得对颓丧的丈夫痛心疾首地喊叫：“大大呀！谁叫你给众人骚这杨柳情嘛……” \n　　正在这混乱之时，孙玉亭出现在了大家面前。玉亭看来也刚吃过鱼，嘴上都沾着一圈油晕。但玉亭同志的喉咙没扎上鱼刺，甭奇怪，他是双水村少数几个吃过鱼的人。他年轻时在太原钢厂当过几年工人，多少吃过几次鱼，因此有“经验”。 \n　　玉亭到来之后，立刻对慌乱的人群说：“大家不要怕！回去喝些老陈醋，喉咙上的刺就化了！” \n　　啊啊，醋能治这病？ \n　　人们就象得了灵丹妙药，纷纷张着嘴巴跑回家里喝醋去了。 \n　　全村的老陈醋一个中午被喝得一干二净。 \n　　尽管醋又把人喝得胃疼肚子疼，但这是“常见病”；重要的是，喉咙上的鱼刺总算被“化”掉了。见多识广的玉亭同志解救了一村人的危难。 \n　　在整个“鱼刺事件”过程中，金家湾的金光亮掼烂鞋子跑遍了东拉河两岸的家户。除过刘玉升，对这事最幸灾乐祸的就数光亮了。 \n　　金光亮对田海民白送鱼让村里人吃心里很不是个滋味。他知道，这小子是要抬高自己的声望哩！除过孙少安，眼下双水村就是他和田海民世事闹腾得最红火，同时也都具有小气吝啬的坏名声。现在，这小子如此破费财产抬高自己，就等于是贬低他金光亮！另外，这不是逼着让他也把自己的蜂蜜白送给村里人去开一次洋荤？因此，当他听说海民得不偿失，弄巧成拙，让许多人喉咙扎上鱼刺的时候，便端着一缸子蜂蜜水，巴咂着嘴一边喝，一边窜着，兴奋地看海民闹出的大笑话。直等到众人用“玉亭疗法”化掉喉咙上的鱼刺后，他才心情舒展地回去抚哺他的“意大利”蜂去了……不久，双水村就传开了田五为儿子编排的第二个“链子嘴”—— \n　　鲤鱼好吃难消化，鱼刺倒把个喉咙扎，大人娃娃嘴张开，哭爹叫妈害了怕。 \n　　海民本想落好人，引得全村一片骂！ \n　　幸亏咱玉亭\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>刘玉升<|>PERSON<|>刘玉升 is a
