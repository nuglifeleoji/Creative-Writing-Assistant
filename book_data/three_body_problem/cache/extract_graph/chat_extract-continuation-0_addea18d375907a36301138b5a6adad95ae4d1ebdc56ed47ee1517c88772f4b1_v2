汪淼很不舒服，况且那人同时还在点烟，头都不抬一下。不等汪淼回答，他就向旁边那位年轻人示意了一下，后者向汪淼出示了警官证，他点完烟后就直接向屋里闯。\n　　“请不要在我家里抽烟。”汪淼拦住了他。\n　　“哦，对不起，汪教授。这是我们史强队长。”年轻警官微笑着说，同时对姓史的使了个眼色。\n　　“成，那就在楼道里说吧。”史强说着，深深地吸了一大口，手中的烟几乎燃下去一半，之后竟不见吐出烟来。 “你问。”他又向年轻警官偏了一下头。\n　　“汪教授，我们是想了解一下，最近你与‘科学边界’学会的成员有过接触，是吧?”\n　　“‘科学边界’是一个在国际学术界很有影响的学术组织，成员都是著名学者。这样一个合法的学术组织，我怎么就不能接触了呢?”\n　　“你看看你这个人!”史强大声说， “我们说它不合法了吗?我们说不让你接触了吗?”他说着，刚才吸进肚子里的烟都喷到汪淼脸上。\n　　“那好，这属于个人隐私，我没必要回答你们的问题。”\n　　“还啥都成隐私了，像你这样一个著名学者，总该对公共安全负责吧。”史强把手中的烟头扔掉，又从压扁了的烟盒里抽出一根。\n　　“我有权不回答，你们请便吧。”汪淼说着要转身回屋。\n　　“等等!”史强厉声说，同时朝旁边的年轻警官挥了一下手， “给他地址和电话，下午去走一趟。”\n　　“你要干什么!”汪淼愤怒地质问，这争吵引得邻居探出头来，想看看出了什么事。\n　　“史队!你说你一一”年轻警官生气地将史强拉到一边，显然他的粗俗不止是让汪淼一人不适应。\n　　“汪教授，请别误会。”一名少校军官急忙上前，“下午有一个重要会议，要请几位学者和专家参加，首长让我们来邀请您。”\n　　“我下午很忙。”\n　　“这我们清楚，首长已经向超导中心领导打了招呼。这次会议上不能没有您，实在不行，我们只有把会议延期等您了。”\n　　史强和他的同事没再说话，转身下楼了，两位军官看着他们走远，似乎都长出了一口气。\n　　“这人怎么这样儿。”少校小声对同事说。\n　　“他劣迹斑斑，前几年在一次劫持人质事件中，他不顾人质的死活擅自行动，结果导致一家三口惨死在罪犯手中；据说他还和黑社会打得火热，用一帮黑道势力去收拾另一帮；去年又搞刑讯逼供，使一名嫌疑人致残，因此被停职了……”\n　　“这种人怎么能进作战中心?”\n　　“首长点名要他，应该有什么过人之处吧。不过，对他限制挺严，除了公安方面的事务，几乎什么都不让他知道\n######################\nOutput:",
