He was known for his ruthless tactics against enemies and captives, which earned him a reputation as a formidable military leader. His strategic decisions were pivotal in directing troops to defend against Wu and in orchestrating military operations, including the attack on Shouchun and planning support for the general Deng Ai.\n\nIn addition to his military prowess, Sima Zhao was a powerful political figure who returned to court to negotiate with the Wei emperor, known as 后主. He was instrumental in the political upheaval that led to the assassination of Emperor Cao Mao, subsequently establishing Cao Huan as the new emperor. This act was part of his broader ambition to consolidate power within the Wei state.\n\nSima Zhao succeeded his brother Sima Shi and continued to build upon the political and military legacy of his family.
