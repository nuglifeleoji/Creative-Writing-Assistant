He could see that in them clearly with eyes the Sisterhood had educated. The Honored Matre and Muzzafar had forgotten or, most likely, abandoned everything that supported the survival of joyous humans. He thought they probably no longer were capable of finding a real wellspring of joy in their own flesh. Theirs would have to be mostly a voyeur’s existence, the eternal observer, always remembering what it had been like before they had taken the turning into whatever it was they had become. Even when they wallowed in the performance of something that once had meant gratification, they would have to reach for new extremes each time just to touch the edges of their own memories.\nThe Honored Matre’s grin widened, showing a line of gleaming white teeth. “Look at him, Muzzafar. He has not the slightest conception of what we can do.”\nTeg heard this but he also saw with eyes trained by the Bene Gesserit. Not a milligram of naivete remained in either of these two. Nothing was expected to surprise them. Nothing could be truly new for them. Still, they plotted and devised, hoping that this extreme would produce the remembered thrill. They knew it would not, of course, and they expected to carry away from the experience only more\nburning rage out of which to fashion another attempt at the unreachable. That was how their thinking went.\nTeg designed a smile for them, using all of the skills he had learned at Bene Gesserit hands. It was a smile full of compassion, of understanding and real pleasure in his own existence. He knew it for the most deadly insult he could hurl at them and he saw it hit. Muzzafar glowered at him. The Honored Matre went from orange-eyed rage to an abrupt surprise and then, quite slowly, to dawning pleasure. She had not expected this! It was something new!\n“Muzzafar,” she said, the orange receding from her eyes, “bring the Honored Matre who has been chosen to mark our Bashar.”\nTeg, his doubled vision showing the immediate peril, understood at last. He could feel awareness of his own future spreading outward like waves as the power grew in him. The wild change in him was continuing! He felt the energy expand. With it came understanding and choices. He saw himself as the whirlwind rampaging through this building—bodies scattered behind him (Muzzafar and the Honored Matre among them) and the whole complex looking like an abattoir when he departed.\nMust I do that? he wondered.\nFor each one he killed, more would have to be killed. He saw the necessity of it, though, as he saw at last the Tyrant’s design. The pain he could see for himself almost made him cry out but he held it back.\n“Yes, bring this Honored Matre to me,” he said, knowing that this would be one less for him to seek out and destroy elsewhere in the building. The room of the scanlyzer controls must be taken out first.\nO you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.\n—SIGN OVER ARRAKEEN LANDING FIELD (HISTORICAL RECORDS: DAR-ES-BALAT)\nIi watched a snow-flutter of falling blossoms against the silvery sky of a Rakian morning. There was an opalescent sheen to the sky that, despite all of her preparatory briefings, she had not anticipated. Rakis held many surprises. The smell of mock orange was powerful here at the edge of the Dar-es-Balat roof garden, overriding all other odors.\nNever believe that you have plumbed the depths of any place... or ofany human, she reminded herself.\nConversation was ended out here but not the echoes of the spoken thoughts they had exchanged only minutes ago. All agreed, though, that it was time for action. Soon, Sheeana would “dance a worm” for them and once more demonstrate her mastery.\nWaff and a new priestly representative would share this “holy event” but Taraza was sure neither of them knew the real nature of what they were about to witness. Waff bore watching, of course. He still carried that air of irritated disbelief in everything he saw or heard. It was a strange mixture with his underlying awe at being on Rakis. The catalyst was obviously his rage over the fact that fools ruled here.\nOdrade returned from the meeting room and stopped beside Taraza.\n“lam extremely disquieted by the reports from Gammu,” Taraza said. “Do you bring something new?”\n“No. Things are obviously still chaotic there.”\n“Tell me, Dar, what do you think we should do?”\n“| keep remembering the Tyrant’s words to Chenoeh: ‘The Bene Gesserit are so close to what they should be, yet so far.’”\nTaraza pointed at the open desert beyond the museum city’s qanat. “He’s still out there, Dar. I’m sure of it.” Taraza turned to face Odrade. “And Sheeana speaks to him.”\n“He told so many lies,” Odrade said.\n“But he didn’t lie about his own incarnation. Remember what he said. ‘Every descendant part of me will carry some of my awareness locked away within it, lost and helpless— pearls of me moving blindly in the sand, caught in an endless dream.’”\n“You bank a great deal on your belief in the power of that dream,” Odrade said.\n“We must recover the Tyrant’s design! All of it!”\nOdrade sighed but did not speak.\n“Never underestimate the power of an idea,” Taraza said. “The Atreides were ever philosophers in their governance. Philosophy is always dangerous because it promotes the creation of new ideas.”\nStill, Odrade did not respond.\n“The worm carries it all within him, Dar! All of the forces he set in motion are still in him.”\n“Are you trying to convince me or yourself, Tar?”\n“Lam punishing you, Dar. Just as the Tyrant is still punishing us.”\n“For not being what we should be? Ahh, here come Sheeana and the others.”\n“The worm’s language, Dar. That is the important thing.”\n“If you say so, Mother Superior.”\nTaraza sent an angry stare at Odrade, who moved forward to greet the newcomers. There was a disturbing gloom in Odrade.\nThe presence of Sheeana, though, restored Taraza’s sense of purpose. An alert little thing, Sheeana. Very good\nmaterial. Sheeana had demonstrated her dance the previous night, performing in the great museum room against a tapestry background, an exotic dance against an exotic spice-fiber hanging with its image of desert and worms. She appeared to be almost a part of the hanging, a figure projected forward from the stylized dunes and their elaborately detailed coursing worms. Taraza recalled how Sheeana’s brown hair had been thrown outward by the whirling movements of the dance, swinging in a fuzzy arc. Sidelighting accented the reddish glints in her hair. Her eyes had been closed but it was not a face in repose. Excitement betrayed itself in the passionate set of her wide mouth, the flaring of her nostrils, the forward thrust of her chin. Her motions had conveyed an inner sophistication that belied her youth.\nThe dance is her language, Taraza thought. Odrade is correct. Seeing it, we will learn it.\nWaff had something of a withdrawn look this morning. It was difficult to determine if his eyes were looking outward or inward.\nWith Waff was Tulushan, a darkly handsome Rakian, the priesthood’s chosen representative at today’s “holy event.” Taraza, meeting him at the demonstration dance, had found it extraordinary how Tulushan never needed to say “but,” and yet the word was always there in everything he uttered. A perfect bureaucrat. He rightly expected to go far but those expectations would soon encounter their ultimate surprise. She felt no pity for him at this knowledge. Tulushan was a soft-faced youth of too few standards for such a position of trust. There was more to him than met the eye, of course. And less.\nWaff moved to one side in the garden, leaving Odrade and Sheeana with Tulushan.\nThe young priest was expendable, naturally. That explained much about why he had been chosen for this venture. It told her that she had achieved the proper level of\npotential violence. Taraza did not think, though, that any of the priestly factions would dare harm Sheeana.\nWe will stay close to Sheeana.\nThey had spent a busy week since the demonstration of the whores’ sexual accomplishments. A very disturbing week, when it came to that. Odrade had been kept busy with Sheeana. Taraza would have preferred Lucilla for this educational chore but you made do with what was available and Odrade obviously was the best available on Rakis for such teaching.\nTaraza looked back toward the desert. They were waiting for the ’thopters from Keen with their cargoes of Very Important Observers. The VIOs were not yet late but crowding it as such people always did.\nSheeana seemed to be taking the sexual education well, although Taraza’s estimation of the Sisterhood’s available teaching males on Rakis was not high. Her first night here, Taraza had called in one of the servant males. Afterward, she had judged it too much trouble for the little joy and forgetfulness it provided. Besides, what was there to forget? To forget was to allow a weakness.\nNever forget!\nThat’s what the whores did, though. They traded in forgetfulness. And they had not the least awareness of the Tyrant’s continuing viselike hold on human destiny nor of the need to break that hold.\nTaraza had listened secretly to the previous day’s session between Sheeana and Odrade.\nWhat was | listening for?\nYoung girl and teacher had been out here in the roof garden, facing each other on two benches, a portable Ixian damper hiding their words from anyone who did not have the coded translator. The suspensor-buoyed damper hovered over the two like a strange umbrella, a black disc projecting distortions that hid the precise movements of lips and the sounds of voices.\nTo Taraza, standing within the long meeting room, the tiny translator in her left ear, the lesson had occurred like an equally distorted memory.\nWhen I was taught these things, we had not seen what the whores of the Scattering could do.\n“Why do we Say it’s the complexity of sex?” Sheeana asked. “The man you sent last night kept saying that.”\n“Many believe they understand it, Sheeana. Perhaps no one has ever understood it, because such words require more of the mind than they do of the flesh.”\n“Why must I not use any of the things we saw the Face Dancers do?”\n“Sheeana, complexity hides within complexity. Great deeds and foul ones have been done at the goading of sexual forces. We speak of ‘sexual strength’ and ‘sexual energies’ and such things as ‘the overmounting urge of desire.’ | don’t deny that such things are observable. But what we are looking at here is a force so powerful that it can destroy you and everything you hold worthwhile.”\n“That’s what I’m trying to understand. What is it the whores are doing wrong?”\n“They ignore the species at its work, Sheeana. | think you can already sense this. The Tyrant certainly knew about it. What was his Golden Path but a vision of sexual forces at work recreating humankind endlessly?”\n“And the whores don’t create?”\n“They mostly try to control their\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a Bashar with abilities enhanced by the Bene Gesserit, capable of seeing deep into human nature and making strategic choices.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRE<|>PERSON<|>The Honored Matre is a powerful and ruthless figure who enjoys tormenting others and seeks extreme experiences.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUZZAFAR<|>PERSON<|>Muzzafar is an associate of the Honored Matre, sharing her cruel tendencies and lack of joy in life.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with deep knowledge of human nature and advanced training methods.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sisterhood refers to the Bene Gesserit, known for their education and influence over key individuals.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is a planet with a desert landscape, home to worms and significant historical events tied to the Tyrant.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAR-ES-BALAT<|>GEO<|>Dar-es-Balat is a location on Rakis with historical significance, including a roof garden and museum city.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN LANDING FIELD<|>GEO<|>A historical site on Rakis mentioned in records, associated with prayers and suffering.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young girl with the ability to communicate with worms, demonstrating mastery through dance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, deeply involved in strategic decisions and the Tyrant's legacy.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit sister tasked with educating Sheeana and analyzing the Tyrant's influence.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>Waff is a skeptical observer on Rakis, representing an outside faction and reacting to events with disbelief.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TULUSHAN<|>PERSON<|>Tulushan is a priestly representative from Rakis, chosen for a holy event but considered expendable.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRANT<|>PERSON<|>The Tyrant is a historical figure whose influence persists, with his design and philosophy still affecting events.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLY EVENT<|>EVENT<|>A significant gathering where Sheeana will demonstrate her ability to communicate with worms.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg was trained by the Bene Gesserit, giving him enhanced abilities and insights.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRE<|>MUZZAFAR<|>The Honored Matre and Muzzafar are associates who share a cruel and joyless existence.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>HONORED MATRE<|>Teg and the Honored Matre are adversaries, with Teg insulting her and recognizing her nature.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>MUZZAFAR<|>Teg and Muzzafar are adversaries, with Teg provoking Muzzafar's anger.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>ODRADE<|>Odrade is educating Sheeana, teaching her about the complexities of human nature and the Tyrant's influence.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>TARAZA<|>Taraza sees Sheeana as key to understanding the Tyrant's design and the Bene Gesserit's future.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>ODRADE<|>Taraza and Odrade work closely, with Taraza relying on Odrade's insights and judgments.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>TYRANT<|>Taraza is deeply concerned with the Tyrant's legacy and seeks to recover his design.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>RAKIS<|>Sheeana is connected to Rakis through her ability to communicate with worms and her role in holy events.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>RAKIS<|>Waff is on Rakis as an observer, reacting with skepticism and awe to the planet's significance.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TULUSHAN<|>HOLY EVENT<|>Tulushan is the priesthood's representative at the holy event, though he is considered expendable.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>HOLY EVENT<|>Sheeana is central to the holy event, where she will demonstrate her mastery over worms.<|>9\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
