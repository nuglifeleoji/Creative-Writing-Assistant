Despite his denials, including during an interrogation by Reverend Mother Odrade, Duncan possesses abilities that align with those of the Kwisatz Haderach, such as visions and heightened awareness.  \n\nThe Bene Gesserit suspect that Duncan, particularly in his ghola (cloned) form, may evolve into a Kwisatz Haderach-like figure, though he himself rejects this designation. His unique traits, including unexplained prescience and resilience, fuel theories that he could either be an alternate manifestation of the Kwisatz Haderach or a precursor to its fulfillment. While contradictions exist between his assertions and the Bene Gesserit's suspicions, the consensus suggests that Duncan Idaho occupies a liminal space—neither fully the Kwisatz Haderach nor entirely separate from its legacy.
