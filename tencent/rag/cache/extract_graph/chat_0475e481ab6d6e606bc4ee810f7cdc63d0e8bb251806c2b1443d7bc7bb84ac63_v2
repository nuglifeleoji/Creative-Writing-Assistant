It is our observation that, even in translation, these words take ona different character when read aloud. We want to share with you a truly extraordinary quality which we have discovered in these volumes.\nLadies and gentlemen, please welcome Rebeth Vreeb.\nFrom the reading by Rebeth Vreeb:\n| assure you that | am the book of fate.\nQuestions are my enemies. For my questions explode! Answers leap up like a frightened flock, blackening the sky of my inescapable memories. Not one answer, not one suffices.\nWhat prisms flash when | enter the terrible field of my past. | am a chip of shattered flint enclosed in a box. The box gyrates and quakes. | am tossed about in a storm of mysteries. And when the box opens, | return to this presence like a stranger in a primitive land.\nSlowly (slowly, | say) | relearn my name.\nBut that is not to know myself!\nThis person of my name, this Leto who is the second of that calling, finds other voices in his mind, other names and other places. Oh, | promise you (as | have been promised) that | answer to but a single name. If you say, “Leto,” | respond. Sufferance makes this true, sufferance and one thing more:\n| hold the threads!\nAll of them are mine. Let me but imagine a topic—say... men who have died by the sword—and | have them in all of their gore, every image intact, every moan, every grimace.\nJoys of motherhood, | think, and the birthing beds are mine. Serial baby smiles and the sweet cooings of new generations. The first walkings of the toddlers and the first victories of youths brought forth for me to share. They tumble one upon another until | can see little else but Sameness and repetition.\n“Keep it all intact,” | warn myself.\nWho can deny the value of such experiences, the worth of learning through which | view each new instant?\nAhhh, but it’s the past.\nDon’t you understand? It’s only the past!\nThis morning | was born in a yurt at the edge of a horse-plain in a land of a planet which no longer exists. Tomorrow | will be born someone else in another place. | have not yet chosen. This morning, though—ahhh, this life! When my eyes had learned to focus, | looked out at sunshine on trampled grass and | saw vigorous people going about the sweet activities of their lives. Where... oh where has all of that vigor gone?\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe three people running northward through moon\nshadows in the Forbidden Forest were strung out along almost half a kilometer. The last runner in the line ran less than a hundred meters ahead of the pursuing D-wolves. The animals could be heard yelping and panting in their eagerness, the way they do when they have the prey in sight.\nWith First Moon almost directly overhead, it was quite light in the forest and, although these were the higher latitudes of Arrakis, it was still warm from the heat of a summer day. The nightly drift of air from the Last Desert of the Sareer carried resin smells and the damp exhalations of the duff underfoot. Now and again, a breeze from the Kynes Sea beyond the Sareer drifted across the runners’ tracks with hints of salt and fishes.\nBy a quirk of fate, the last runner was called Ulot, which in the Fremen tongue means “Beloved Straggler.” Ulot was Short in stature and with a tendency to fat which had placed an extra dieting burden on him in training for this venture. Even when slimmed down for their desperate run, his face remained round, the large brown eyes vulnerable in that suggestion of too much flesh.\nTo Ulot it was obvious that he could not run much farther. He panted and wheezed. Occasionally, he staggered. But he did not call out to his companions. He knew they could not help him. All of them had taken the same oath, knowing they had no defenses except the old virtues and Fremen loyalties. This remained true even though everything that once had been Fremen had now a museum quality—rote recitals learned from Museum Fremen.\nIt was Fremen loyalty that kept Ulot silent in the full awareness of his doom. A fine display of the ancient qualities, and rather pitiful when none of the runners had any but book knowledge and the legends of the Oral History about the virtues they aped.\nThe D-wolves ran close behind Ulot, giant gray figures almost man-height at the shoulders. They leaped and whined in their eagerness, heads lifted, eyes focused on the moon-betrayed figure of their quarry.\nA root caught Ulot’s left foot and he almost fell. This gave him renewed energy. He put on a burst of speed, gaining perhaps a wolf-length on his pursuers. His arms pumped. He breathed noisily through his open mouth.\nThe D-wolves did not change pace. They were silver Shadows which went flick-flick through the loud green smells of their forest. They knew they had won. It was a familiar experience.\nAgain, Ulot stumbled. He caught his balance against a Sapling and continued his panting flight, gasping, his legs trembling in rebellion against these demands. No energy remained for another burst of speed.\nOne of the D-wolves, a large female, moved out on Ulot’s left flank. She swerved inward and leaped across his path. Giant fangs ripped Ulot’s shoulder and staggered him but he did not fall. The pungency of blood was added to the forest smells. A smaller male caught his right hip and at last Ulot fell, screaming. The pack pounced and his screams were cut off in abrupt finality.\nNot stopping to feed, the D-wolves again took up the chase. Their noses probed the forest floor and the vagrant eddies in the air, scenting the warm tracery of two more running humans.\nThe next runner in the line was named Kwuteg, an old and honorable name on Arrakis, a name from the Dune times. An ancestor had served Sietch Tabr as Master of the Deathstills, but that was more than three thousand years lost in a past which many no longer believed. Kwuteg ran with the long strides of a tall and slender body which seemed perfectly fitted to such exertion. Long black hair streamed back from his aquiline features. As with his companions, he wore a black running suit of tightly knitted cotton. It revealed the workings of his buttocks and stringy thighs, the deep and steady rhythm of his breathing. Only his pace, which was markedly slow for Kwuteg, betrayed the fact that he had injured his right knee coming down from the man-made precipices which girdled the God Emperor’s Citadel fortress in the Sareer.\nKwuteg heard Ulot’s screams, the abrupt and potent silence, then the renewed chase-yelps of the D-wolves. He tried not to let his mind create the image of another friend being slain by Leto’s monster guardians but imagination worked its sorcery on him. Kwuteg thought a curse against the tyrant but wasted no breath to voice it. There remained a chance that he could reach the sanctuary of the Idaho River. Kwuteg knew what his friends thought about him— even Siona. He had always been known as a conservative. Even as a child he had saved his energy until it counted most, parceling out his reserves like a miser.\nIn spite of the injured knee, Kwuteg increased his pace. He knew the river was near. His injury had gone beyond agony into a steady flame which filled his entire leg and side with its burning. He knew the limits of his endurance. He knew also that Siona should be almost at the water. The fastest runner of them all, she carried the sealed packet\nand, in it, the things they had stolen from the fortress in the Sareer. Kwuteg focused his thoughts on that packet as he ran.\nSave it, Siona! Use it to destroy him!\nThe eager whining of the D-wolves penetrated Kwuteg’s consciousness. They were too close. He knew then that he would not escape.\nBut Siona must escape!\nHe risked a backward glance and saw one of the wolves move to flank him. The pattern of their attack plan imprinted itself on his awareness. As the flanking wolf leaped Kwuteg also leaped. Placing a tree between himself and the pack, he ducked beneath the flanking wolf, grasped one of its hind legs in both hands and, without stopping, whirled the captive wolf as a flail which scattered the others. Finding the creature not as heavy as he had expected, almost welcoming the change of action, he flailed his living bludgeon at the attackers in a dervish whirl which brought two of them down in a crash of skulls. But he could not guard every side. A lean male caught him in the back, hurling him against a tree and he lost his bludgeon.\n“Go!” he screamed.\nThe pack bored in and Kwuteg caught the throat of the lean male in his teeth. He bit down with every gram of his final desperation. Wolf blood spurted over his face, blinding him. Rolling without any knowledge of where he went, Kwuteg grappled another wolf. Part of the pack dissolved into a yelping, whirling mob, some turning against their own injured. Most of the pack remained intent on the quarry, though. Teeth ripped Kwuteg’s throat from both sides.\nSiona, too, had heard Ulot scream, then the unmistakable silence followed by the yelping of the pack as the wolves resumed the chase. Such anger filled her that she felt she might explode with it. Ulot had been included in this venture because of his analytical ability, his way of seeing a whole from only a few parts. It had been Ulot who, taking the\ninevitable magnifier from his kit, had examined the two strange volumes they had found in with the Citadel’s plans.\n“I think it’s a cipher,” Ulot had said.\nAnd Radi, poor Radi who had been the first of their team to die... . Radi had said, “We can’t afford the extra weight. Throw them away.”\nUlot had objected: “Unimportant things aren’t concealed this way.”\nKwuteg had joined Radi. “We came for the Citadel plans and we have them. Those things are too heavy.”\nBut Siona had agreed with Ulot. “I will carry them.”\nThat had ended the argument.\nPoor Ulot.\nThey had all known him as the worst runner in the team. Ulot was slow in most things, but the clarity of his mind could not be denied.\nHe is trustworthy.\nUlot had been trustworthy.\nSiona mastered her anger and used its energy to increase her pace. Trees whipped past her in the moonlight. She had entered that timeless void of the running when there was nothing else but her own movements, her own body doing what it had been conditioned to do.\nMen thought her beautiful when she ran. Siona knew this. Her long dark hair was tied tightly to keep it from whipping in the wind of her passage. She had accused Kwuteg of foolishness when he had refused to copy her style.\nWhere is Kwuteg?\nHer hair was not like Kwuteg’s. It was that deep brown which is sometimes confused with black, but is not truly black, not like Kwuteg’s at all.\nIn the way genes occasionally do, her features copied those of a long dead ancestor: gently oval and witha generous mouth, eyes of alert awareness above a small nose.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0475e481ab6d6e606bc4ee810f7cdc63d0e8bb251806c2b1443d7bc7bb84ac63_v2"}
