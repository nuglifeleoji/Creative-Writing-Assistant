As pre-born individuals, they possess the collective knowledge and experiences of their ancestors, granting them profound strategic insight and maturity beyond their years.  \n\nBoth twins share a deep bond, united by their shared memories and the weight of their heritage. Their abilities make them pivotal figures in the continuation of the Atreides bloodline and the fulfillment of their father’s legacy.
