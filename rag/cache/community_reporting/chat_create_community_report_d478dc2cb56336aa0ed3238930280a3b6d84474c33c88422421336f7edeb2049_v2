This era is frequently referenced in historical records and debates concerning the consequences of the Golden Path, Leto II's long-term plan for humanity's survival. The collapse of his rule triggered extreme hardship, marked by food shortages, environmental degradation, and violent desperation.  \n\nDuring this time, many planets, including Gammu (formerly Dan), underwent significant destruction and subsequent rebuilding. Forests were heavily logged, leaving lasting ecological impacts that explain the altered state of some planetary landscapes. The Fish Speakers, once a dominant force in Rakian society, were cast out, further destabilizing political structures.  \n\nContradictions arise regarding the Famine Times' relationship to the Scattering—some sources claim it preceded this mass diaspora, while others suggest it was a direct consequence. However, the prevailing interpretation is that the Famine Times emerged immediately after Leto II's death, creating conditions that eventually led to the Scattering as survivors sought new resources and stability beyond the known universe.  \n\nDesperation drove people to extreme measures, including raids on Sietch Tabr in search of the precious spice melange, highlighting the breakdown of order. The period remains a cautionary example of the suffering that followed the end of a rigidly controlled regime, illustrating both the fragility of civilization and the resilience of those who endured.  \n\nIn summary, the Famine Times were a catastrophic transitional phase, characterized by scarcity, violence, and ecological damage, shaping the course of human history in the aftermath of Leto II's rule.\",5\n1520,SCATTERING,\"**The Scattering** refers to a vast historical diaspora of humanity, initiated as part of Leto II's Golden Path to ensure genetic diversity and prevent extinction. This mass exodus saw humans disperse far beyond the Old Empire into uncharted regions of the universe, driven by necessity, myth, and the fear of stagnation. Over time, these scattered populations developed advanced technologies, such as the T-probe, and evolved into distinct factions, including the Honored Matres, Futars, and Handlers.  \n\nThe Bene Gesserit played a key role in the Scattering, strategically sending out Reverend Mothers and preserving their knowledge through dispersed cells. However, the event also led to unforeseen consequences, as some returning groups—particularly the Honored Matres—emerged as aggressive threats, seeking dominance over the remnants of the Old Empire. The Honored Matres, in particular, are a product of the Scattering, having developed formidable power and now challenging the Bene Gesserit's control.  \n\nThe Scattering is referenced in relation to major historical shifts, including the decline of the Fish Speakers, the rise of new civilizations, and the struggles of factions like the Tleilaxu and Ixians to adapt. It is both a survival strategy and a source of instability, as the exponential growth of scattered populations and their unknown motives complicate the Bene Gesserit's long-term plans.  \n\nUltimately, the Scattering represents humanity's infinite expansion, a daunting yet necessary dispersal that reshaped the universe, creating both opportunities and existential threats for those who remained behind.\",23\n1827,LOST ONES,\"The Lost Ones are Tleilaxu who returned from the Scattering\"\"\",2\n1934,SEEKING,\"An alternative term for the Scattering, mentioned in the conversation.\"\"\",1\n2073,NULLTUBE,\"Transportation artifact from the Scattering used in the tower\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3617,ODRADE,FAMINE TIMES,Odrade's history on Gammu is connected to the aftermath of the Famine Times.,114\n3654,SCATTERING,FAMINE TIMES,\"The **Scattering** and the **Famine Times** are historically linked events, with the Famine Times playing a significant role in precipitating the Scattering.
