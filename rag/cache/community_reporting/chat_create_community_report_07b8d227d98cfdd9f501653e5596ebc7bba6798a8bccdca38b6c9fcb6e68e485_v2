Dominated by the **Emperor's Keep** (or **Atreides Keep**), it is a fortified stronghold chosen by **House Atreides** for its defensibility, surrounded by the **Shield Wall** and the **plain of Arrakeen**. The city is a central hub for spaceport activities and houses key landmarks such as the **Temple Plaza**, **Alia’s Fane of the Oracle**, and the **governor’s mansion**, where pivotal political and ceremonial events unfold.  \n\nArrakeen has witnessed significant historical events, including the **attack that killed Duke Leto Atreides**, the rise of **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)**, and the **battle involving giant worms**. It was once controlled by the **Harkonnens** before becoming the seat of **Atreides rule**, though it later fell into decay under **Alia’s reign**. The city is also linked to **Fremen** culture, with references to the **sietch oasis** and the ancient Fremen sky symbolically represented in **Sietch Tabr’s ceiling**.  \n\nNotable figures such as **The Preacher**, **Lady Jessica**, and **Leto II** have been associated with Arrakeen, where **Paul’s reception hall** drew pilgrims and where **Alia’s audience chamber** held sway. The city’s suburbs housed **veterans of the Jihad**, and its dungeons were sites of intrigue, including a death that yielded a **password and a tortoise ring**. Despite partial destruction by **Onn**, remnants of its ancient avenues and buildings persist.  \n\nArrakeen remains a focal point of conflict, from **Harkonnen assaults** to **Emperor’s threats**, and a symbol of power struggles, prophecy (such as the **Lisan al-Gaib**), and the enduring legacy of the Atreides. Its blend of gardens, fountains, and militarized zones reflects its dual role as both a center of governance and a battleground for control of **spice** and the Imperium.\",17\r\n39,CARTHAG,\"**Carthag** is a prominent city on the desert planet Arrakis, located approximately 200 kilometers northeast of Arrakeen. Originally constructed by the Harkonnens, it served as a key stronghold for their regime and was once the capital of Arrakis before being supplanted by Arrakeen. The city is characterized by its industrial and commercial significance, though its architecture is often described as cheap and brassy, reflecting the Harkonnens' utilitarian and oppressive style.  \n\nCarthag played a central role during the attack on House Atreides, as it was a focal point of Harkonnen control and the site of violent upheavals. Its strategic importance and Harkonnen dominance created a stark contrast with Arrakeen, which later became the seat of Atreides power. Though no longer the capital, Carthag remains a notable urban center on Arrakis, emblematic of the Harkonnens' brutal and exploitative legacy on the planet.  \n\nThe city’s history as a former capital, its industrial activity, and its role in the conflict between the Harkonnens and Atreides collectively define Carthag as a crucial, if grim, landmark in the political and economic landscape of Arrakis.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n119,ARRAKEEN,CARTHAG,\"Arrakeen and Carthag are rival cities on Arrakis, with Carthag being the Harkonnen stronghold.\",18\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
