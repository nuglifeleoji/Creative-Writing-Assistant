诸将引兵于篱外镇压。李乐等专权，百官稍有触犯，竟于帝前殴骂；故意送浊酒粗食与帝，帝勉强纳之。李乐、韩暹又连名保奏无徒、部曲、巫医、走卒二百余名，并为校尉、御史等官。刻印不及，以锥画之，全不成体统。却说韩融曲说傕、汜二贼。二贼从其言，乃放百官及宫人归。是岁大荒，百姓皆食枣菜，饿莩遍野。河内太守张杨献米肉，河东太守王邑献绢帛，帝稍得宁。董承、杨奉商议，一面差人修洛阳宫院，欲奉车驾还东都。李乐不从。董承谓李乐曰：“洛阳本天子建都之地，安邑乃小地面，如何容得车驾？今奉驾还洛阳是正理。”李乐曰：“汝等奉驾去，我只在此处住。”承、奉乃奉驾起程。李乐暗令人结连李傕、郭汜，一同劫驾。董承、杨奉、韩暹知其谋，连夜摆布军士，护送车驾前奔箕关。李乐闻知，不等傕、汜军到，自引本部人马前来追赶。四更左侧，赶到箕山下，大叫：“车驾休行！李傕、郭汜在此！”吓得献帝心惊胆战。山上火光遍起。正是：前番两贼分为二，今番三贼合为一。不知汉天子怎离此难，且听下文分解。\n\n\n\n第十四回
