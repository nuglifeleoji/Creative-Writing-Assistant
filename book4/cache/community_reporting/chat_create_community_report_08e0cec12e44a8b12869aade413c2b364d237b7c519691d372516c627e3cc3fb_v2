It is often regarded as a symbol of connection to the land and heritage for the local people, reflecting their historical and cultural identity. The river is the second longest in China, flowing approximately 5,464 kilometers (3,395 miles) and is characterized by its heavy sediment load, with an annual influx of around 1.6 billion tons of silt. This sediment contributes to the river's distinctive yellow color and has significant implications for agriculture and flood management in the surrounding areas.\n\nGeographically, the Yellow River is located about one to two hundred miles north of Tongcheng, flowing eastward and carrying vast amounts of silt. This sedimentation has historically posed challenges, leading to agricultural concerns and flooding, which have impacted the livelihoods of communities along its banks. The river's unpredictable nature has necessitated extensive flood control measures and has shaped the agricultural practices in the region.\n\nIn literature and narratives, the Yellow River often serves as a pivotal landmark, symbolizing both a physical and metaphorical journey. For instance, it is mentioned as a significant crossing point for protagonists in various stories, highlighting its importance as a geographical feature that influences the course of events and the lives of individuals.\n\nOverall, the Yellow River is not only a vital waterway for transportation and irrigation but also a powerful emblem of the cultural and historical essence of China, deeply intertwined with the lives of the people who depend on it. Its dual role as a source of sustenance and a potential threat underscores the complex relationship between nature and humanity in this region.\",4\r\n1090,煤矿工人,\"煤矿工人 are individuals who work in the coal mines, often under extreme conditions, and are essential for coal extraction.\",2\r\n1083,铜城,\"铜城, also known as Copper City, is a historically significant city located in western China, renowned for its rich coal deposits and extensive mining activities. The city has been a focal point for many displaced villagers who migrated to the area, particularly surrounding the state-owned farm. It has a vibrant atmosphere that experiences a surge in population and activity, especially when miners receive their wages, reflecting the economic importance of the mining industry to the local community.\n\nThe city is not only a hub for coal production but also engages in the manufacturing of ceramics, cement, and refractory materials, showcasing its diverse industrial base. Since the Warring States period, 铜城 has played a crucial role in the region's development, attracting individuals seeking better livelihoods. This influx of people has contributed to the city's bustling environment, characterized by bright lights and a lively atmosphere.\n\nSeveral characters are associated with 铜城, each with their own intentions and experiences. 武惠良 plans to work as a miner in the city, while 孙少平 travels there in search of 田晓霞 and to buy gifts for his family before returning home. The city serves as a backdrop for significant events, including a recognition event attended by 少平 and interactions between him and 晓霞. Additionally, 金波 travels to 铜城 after leaving 大牙湾煤矿, indicating the city's role as a key destination for those involved in the mining industry.\n\nThe city is also mentioned in the context of railway development aimed at connecting it with 黄原, highlighting its strategic importance in regional transportation and commerce. Furthermore, it is a place where characters like 少安 conduct business and manage logistics, reflecting the economic activities that thrive in 铜城.\n\nDespite its bustling nature, 铜城 is a place where some characters, like the protagonist, do not stop during their journeys, indicating that while it is a significant location, it may also serve as a transit point for others. The city is deeply intertwined with the lives of its inhabitants, who regard it as their land, and it continues to be a source of hope and opportunity for many seeking a better future.\n\nIn summary, 铜城 is a dynamic city with a rich history and a strong connection to the coal mining industry, serving as a destination for work, commerce, and personal connections among its residents and visitors.\",27\r\n1086,陇海铁路,陇海铁路是连接铜城与其他地区的重要铁路，发挥着关键的交通枢纽作用。它不仅促进了煤炭的运输，还吸引了外地公民的迁入，推动了当地经济的发展。作为连接铜城与省城的主要铁路，陇海铁路提供了客运和货运服务，满足了人们的出行需求和货物运输的便利性。通过这条铁路，铜城与周边地区的联系更加紧密，进一步促进了区域间的交流与合作。,1\r\n1088,鄂尔多斯,鄂尔多斯是铜城所在的地区，因煤炭资源而繁荣。,1\r\n1089,飞机场,铜城的南郊有一个军民两用的飞机场，是市内较为开阔的地方。,1\r\n1091,保加利亚,\"保加利亚 is a country referenced for its population size, which is comparable to the number of coal miners and their families in China.\",1\r\n1092,新石器时期,新石器时期 marks a historical period when early inhabitants of 铜城 began utilizing coal for making decorative items.,1\r\n1093,西汉,西汉 is a historical period during which coal was used for iron smelting in 铜城.,1\r\n1079,铜城矿务局,\"铜城矿务局 is a coal mining organization that has been operating for over thirty years, playing a significant role in the local economy through the extraction of substantial amounts of coal.

Initially, 河南人 is portrayed as someone who was hired by 孙少安 to assist with brick-making. However, he lacks the necessary skills for the job, which ultimately leads to a disaster in the brick production process. This highlights a significant challenge in the operation of the kiln, as the lack of expertise can severely impact productivity and quality.\n\nOn the other hand, 河南人 is also described as a skilled worker, suggesting that he possesses the capabilities required for effective brick-making. This duality in his characterization raises questions about his actual skills and adaptability in the workplace. It is possible that his initial lack of skills was a temporary setback, or that he was able to learn and improve over time, thus contributing positively to the brick-making process.\n\nBeyond his role in the brick kiln, 河南人 represents a broader demographic of people who have migrated to 铜城. This group is characterized by their open and generous nature, as well as a lifestyle marked by frugality and hard work. The description emphasizes the cultural traits of 河南人, portraying them as individuals who are not only industrious but also embody a spirit of camaraderie and resilience.\n\nIn summary, 河南人 is a multifaceted character within the context of 孙少安's brick kiln, initially struggling with the demands of brick production but also potentially possessing the skills necessary for the job. Additionally, he symbolizes the larger community of migrants to 铜城, known for their positive attributes and work ethic. This combination of personal and cultural characteristics paints a complex picture of 河南人, illustrating both the challenges and strengths found within this group.\",3\r\n701,砖窑,\"The \"\"砖窑\"\" (brick kiln) is a significant project initiated by 孙少安, who aims to utilize his earnings to establish a sustainable source of income for himself and his family.

This failure underscores the complexities involved in running such a project and the potential pitfalls that can arise from inadequate oversight and expertise. Despite these setbacks, the brick kiln remains a focal point in the community, symbolizing both the aspirations of 孙少安 and the collective labor of his family, as well as the broader implications for local industry. \n\nIn summary, the brick kiln operated by 孙少安 is a multifaceted entity that embodies the hopes for economic sustainability, the importance of family collaboration, and the challenges of managing a local industry effectively.\",6\r\n702,村,The village where 孙少安 and 秀莲 live and plan to build the brick kiln.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2600,黄河,少安,少安 crosses the 黄河 during his journey,106\r\n2366,煤矿工人,铜城,煤矿工人 contribute to the economy of 铜城 through their labor in the coal mines,29\r\n2357,铜城,陇海铁路,\"The entity \"\"铜城\"\" (Copper City) is significantly influenced by the \"\"陇海铁路\"\" (Longhai Railway), which plays a crucial role in its transportation infrastructure.
