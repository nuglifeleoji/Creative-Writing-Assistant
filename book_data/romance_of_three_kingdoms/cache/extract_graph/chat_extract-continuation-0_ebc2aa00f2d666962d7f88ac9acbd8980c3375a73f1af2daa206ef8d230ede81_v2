使者辞别吕蒙，蒙亲送出城。使者回见关公，具道吕蒙之语，并说：“荆州城中，君侯宝眷并诸将家属，俱各无恙，供给不缺。”公大怒曰：“此奸贼之计也！我生不能杀此贼，死必杀之，以雪吾恨！”喝退使者。使者出寨，众将皆来探问家中之事；使者具言各家安好，吕蒙极其恩恤，并将书信传送各将。各将欣喜，皆无战心。\n\n    关公率兵取荆州，军行之次，将士多有逃回荆州者。关公愈加恨怒，遂催军前进。忽然喊声大震，一彪军拦住，为首大将，乃蒋钦也，勒马挺枪大叫曰：“云长何不早降！”关公骂曰：“吾乃汉将，岂降贼乎！”拍马舞刀，直取蒋钦。不三合，钦败走。关公提刀追杀二十余里，喊声忽起，左边山谷中韩当领军冲出，右边山谷中周泰引军冲出，蒋钦回马复战，三路夹攻。关公急撒军回走。行无数里，只见南山冈上人烟聚集，一面白旗招飐，上写“荆州土人”四字，众人都叫本处人速速投降。关公大怒，欲上冈杀之。山崦内又有两军撞出：左边丁奉，右边徐盛；并合蒋钦等三路军马，喊声震地，鼓角喧天，将关公困在核心。手下将士，渐渐消疏。比及杀到黄昏，关公遥望四山之上，皆是荆州土兵，呼兄唤弟，觅子寻爷，喊声不住。军心尽变，皆应声而去。关公止喝不住，部从止有三百余人。杀至三更，正东上喊声连天，乃是关平、廖化分两路兵杀入重围，救出关公。关平告曰：“军心乱矣，必得城池暂屯，以待援兵。麦城虽小，足可屯扎。”关公从之，催促残军前至麦城，分兵紧守四门，聚将士商议。赵累曰：“此处相近上庸，现有刘封、孟达在彼把守，可速差人往求救兵。若得这枝军马接济，以待川兵大至，军心自安矣。”\n\n    正议间，忽报吴兵已至，将城四面围定。公问曰：“谁敢突围而出，往上庸求救？”廖化曰：“某愿往。”关平曰：“我护送汝出重围。”关公即修书付廖化藏于身畔。饱食上马，开门出城。正遇吴将丁奉截往。被关平奋力冲杀，奉败走，廖化乘势杀出重围。投上庸去了。关平入城，坚守不出。\n\n
