It is recognized for its strategic importance in military campaigns and political maneuvers of the time. During the late Eastern Han dynasty, 豫州 was a focal point for various military operations, highlighting its relevance in the broader context of Chinese history.\n\nIn the Three Kingdoms period, 豫州 gained further prominence when 刘备, a key figure in the era, was appointed as its governor. This appointment underscored the region's importance as a base of power and influence. The strategic significance of 豫州 is further illustrated in the context of military strategy and loyalty during historical conflicts, particularly as various leaders sought to control this vital territory.\n\n豫州 was also a critical area in the power struggles involving prominent figures such as 孙权 and 孔明, who devised strategies to gain control over the region against their rival 曹操. The region's military and political dynamics made it a significant battleground for loyalty and territorial claims, reflecting the complexities of the era's conflicts.\n\nOverall, 豫州 is characterized by its historical significance as a province that shaped military strategies and political alliances during some of China's most tumultuous times.
