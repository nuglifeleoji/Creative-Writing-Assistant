此我也不在行，我的工作更偏重于防骗和揭穿骗局。这样，我给你讲讲审讯的几个基本技巧，你以后有可能用得着，到时知己知彼容易对付些。当然，只是最基本最常用的，复杂的一时也说不清。先说最文的一种，也是最简单的一种：拉单子，就是把与案子有关的问题列一个单子，单子上的问题越多越好，八竿子刚打着的全列上去，把关键要问的混在其中，然后一条一条地问，记下审讯对象的回答，然后再从头问一遍，也记下回答，必要时可以问很多遍，最后对照这几次的记录，如果对象说假话，那相应的问题每次的回答是有出入的你别看这办法简单，没有经过反侦查训练的人基本上都过不了关，对付拉单子，最可靠的办法就是保持沉默。”史强说着不由得又掏出烟来，但想起飞机上不能抽烟后又放回去。\n　　“你问问看，这是专机，应该能抽烟的。”罗辑对史强说。\n　　史强正说到兴头上，对罗辑打断自己的话有些恼火，罗辑惊奇地看到他似乎是很认真的，要不就是这人的幽默感太强了。史强按下沙发旁边的那个红色送话器按钮问了话，小张果然回答说请便。于是两人拿出烟抽了起来。\n　　“下一个，半文半武的。你能够着烟灰缸吧，固定着的，得拔下来，好。这一招叫黑白脸。这种审讯需要多人配合，稍复杂一些。首先是黑脸出来，一般是两人以上。他们对你很凶，可能动文的也可能动武的，反正很凶。这也是有策略的，不仅仅是让你产生恐惧，更重要的是激发你的孤独感，让你感觉全世界除了想吃你的狼就再没别的了。这时白脸出来了，肯定只有一个人，而且肯定长得慈眉善目，他制止了黑脸们，说你也是一个人，有人的权利，你们怎么能这样对待他？黑脸们说你走开，不要影响工作。白脸坚持，说你们真的不能这样做！黑脸们说早就知道你干不了这个，干不了走人啊！白脸用身体护住你说：我要保护他的权利，保护法律的公正！黑脸们说你等着，明天你就滚蛋了！然后气哼哼地走了。就剩你们俩时，白脸会替你擦擦汗呀血呀的，说别怕，有我在，他们不敢把你怎么样。不管我落到什么下场，定会维护你的权利！你不想说就别说了，你有权沉默！接下来的事儿你就能想得出了，他这时成了你在这个世界上唯一的最亲的人，在他进一步的利诱下，你是不会沉默的……这一招对付知识分子最管用，但与前面拉单子不同，你一旦知道了，它就失效了。当然，以上讲的一般都不单独使用，真正的审讯是一个大工程，是多种技术的综合……”\n　　史强眉飞色舞地说着，几乎想挣脱安全带站起来，但罗\n######################\nOutput:",
