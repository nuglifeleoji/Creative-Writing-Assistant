\n　　孙玉厚蹲在脚地上抽了一会烟，思量了大半天，然后又对少安妈说：“你说得对，也不对。人常说，一娘生九种，更不要说那女娃娃虽然和贺凤英是同一户族，但不知隔了多少辈，怎能就一个样呢？我看还是让少安跑一趟，叫他亲自见见面，看倒究怎样。行了当然好，不行了拉倒，又贴赔不了什么！” \n　　少安妈又觉得老汉的话有道理了。是呀，怎能凭空就说那女娃娃和贺凤英一个样呢？话再说回来，自家这光景，好不容易碰上这么个不要财礼的人家，不敢轻易错过机会。她马上支持老汉的意见，同意让少安到山西相亲去。 \n　　当天中午吃完饭，孙玉厚老汉就把这件事给少安摊开说了…… \n　　少安听父亲说了这件事后，脑子里面先反应不过来。 \n　　他就要正式相亲去？那就是说，他要娶个媳妇回来？从此就要和一个女人生活在一起？生孩子？他也将要有孩子了？自己不久前也还是个孩子啊……但少安内心开始翻腾了。他想这件事迟早总会发生的。他的年龄的确不小了。村里和他同龄的人，已经媳妇娃娃都有了；看见人家小两口子一块亲亲热热，自己心里就忍不住毛乱半天。 \n　　可是，他立刻就想到了润叶。尽管他对她早已死了心，或者说根本就没有考虑过他和她结合的可能性，但一旦他自己要找另外一个女人的时候，他就以无比痛苦的心情又想到了润叶。他伤心地认识到，他是多么地热爱和留恋她。是的，他和她的感情本来就象苹果树上完整的一枝，在那上面可以结出同样美丽的、红脸蛋似的苹果来；现在却要把自己的那一部分从上面剪下来，嫁接到另一棵不相同的树上——天知道那会结出什么样的果实来。生活的大剪刀是多么的无情，它要按照自己的安排来对每一个人的命运进行剪裁！ \n　　一切都毫无办法。对于一个普通人来说，只好听命于生活的裁决。这不是宿命，而是无法超越客观条件。在这个世界上，不是所有合理的和美好的都能按照自己的愿望存在或者实现。 \n　　孙少安最后一次审视了他和润叶的关系，结果结论和开始时的认识完全是一样的。其实还有必要再考虑他们之间结合的可能性吗？一切都明摆着，就象金家湾和田家圪崂隔着一条东拉河一样明确。但是，这不由人啊！再强大的理智力量也无法象锁子锁门一样锁住感情的翅膀！ \n　　几天以来，孙少安心神不宁，目光恍惚，说话常常前言不搭后语。他已经答应父母亲去山西相亲，但却迟迟没有动身。
