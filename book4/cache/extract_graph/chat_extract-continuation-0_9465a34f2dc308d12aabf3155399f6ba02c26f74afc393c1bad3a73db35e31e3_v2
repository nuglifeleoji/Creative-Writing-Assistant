方，竟是这样的荒芜衰败了！院子里蒿草长了一人高；窑面墙到处都是裂缝，麻雀在裂缝中垒窝筑巢，叽叽喳喧，飞进飞出，那副篮球架已经腐朽不堪，倒塌在荒草之中……这就是当年他和润叶上过学的地方！以后，他的弟弟、妹妹，都在这里上过学。而现在，他的儿子却不得不离开这地方，搬到曾经喂驴拴马的棚圈里去念书了。这是历史的耻辱，也是双水村的耻辱。田福堂和他二爸那些人不知道是否为此感到羞愧？当年意想天开，炸山打坝；结果人亡坝破，把个好端端的学校也震垮了。哼，田福堂口口声声要给双水村人民造福，瞧，这就是他造下的“福”！ \n　　“不过，你孙少安大发感慨，可又给双水村做了些什么事？”有一个声音突然在内心中问他。 \n　　孙少安怔了怔，忍不住仰起脸向天空长长地嘘了一口气。仅仅在这一刹那间，某种想法便不由地主宰了他的意识，他猛然想：是呀，我为什么不可以把这座学校重新建造起来呢？连神汉刘玉升都有魄力重建庙坪的破庙，我为什么没勇气重建这个破学校？ \n　　一种使命感强烈地震撼了这个年轻庄稼人的心，使他浑身不由滚过了一道激奋的颤栗！ \n　　孙少安立刻想起了不久前在大牙湾煤矿和弟弟的那次谈话。少平说的有道理！他既然慷慨地准备把一大笔钱扔到“三国”去，为什么不拿这钱给村里人办点事！电视台有得是来钱处！国家、省上、县上、乡上，那也自有人治理呢！ \n　　而农村，就得靠生活在其间的人来治理。双水村是他生存的世界，他一生的苦难、幸福、屈辱、荣耀，都在这个地方；无论从哪方面说，他都应该为亲爱的双水村做点事。他有能力这样做——他的能力实际上也许只够在这个天地里施展！ \n　　孙少安这样一想，便很有些激动。他甚至把他将要做的事放到了本村近代史中去考虑。人的这样一些活动，通常也不可避免地要受一种历史意识的支配。 \n　　在双水村最近的几代人中，曾有过几个人用不同的方式给这个古老贫困的村庄上打了深深的印记。 \n　　首先是金光亮他爸。这位老地主几乎占据过本村三分之二的土地，使得许多人牛马般活了一生就无声无息地睡到了黄土地里。另一位是俊武他爸。深孚众望的金先生精通孔孟学说，用他的道德文章为村里村外的人做过许多好事。东拉河一带象他父亲那个年龄的人，如果有识字知书者，都是受惠于这位老先生：连�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
