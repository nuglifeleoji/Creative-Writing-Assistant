In this period of political turmoil and shifting power dynamics, 袁谭 recognized the need for effective military strategies to maintain his position and respond to emerging threats. 郭图, known for his strategic acumen, provided valuable advice to 袁谭, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by 袁尚, who was advancing with his forces.\n\nThe collaboration between 袁谭 and 郭图 highlights the importance of strategic alliances and expert guidance in the tumultuous landscape of the time.
