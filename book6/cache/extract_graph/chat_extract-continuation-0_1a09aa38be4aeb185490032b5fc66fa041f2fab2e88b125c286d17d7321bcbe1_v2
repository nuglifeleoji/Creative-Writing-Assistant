简陋的意识中把这个形状建立起来：“墓”。再向上，又是一个凹槽的组合，但比前一个简单多了，不过为了探索它，褐蚁仍不得不清空记忆，忘掉“墓”。它首先爬进一道线条优美的槽，这形态让它想起了不久前发现的一只刚死的蝈蝈的肚子。它很快搞清了这个结构：“之”。以后向上的攀登路程中，又遇到两个凹槽组合。前一个中包括两个水滴状的坑和一个蝈蝈肚子——“冬”；最上面的一个分成两部分，组合起来是“杨”。这是褐蚁最后记住的一个形状，也是这段攀登旅程中唯一记住的一个，前面爬过的那些有趣的形状都忘掉了。\n　　“叶老师，从社会学角度看，这两条公理都是足够坚实的……。您这么快就说出来，好像胸有成竹似的。”罗辑有些吃惊地说。\n　　“我已经想了大半辈子，但确实是第一次同人谈起这个，我真的不知道为什么要谈……哦，要想从这两条公理推论出宇宙社会学的基本图景，还有两个重要概念：猜疑链和技术爆炸。”\n　　“很有意思的两个名词，您能解释一下吗？”\n　　叶文洁看看表：“没有时间了，其实你这样聪明，自己也能想出来，你可以先从这两条公理着手创立这门学科，那你就有可能成为宇宙社会学的欧几里得了。”\n　　“叶老师，我成不了欧几里得，但会记住您的话，试着去做做，以后我可能还会去请教您。”\n　　“怕没有机会了……或者，体就当我随便说说，不管是哪种情况，我都尽了责任。好，小罗，我走了。”\n　　“……叶老师，您保重。”\n　　叶文洁在暮色中离去，走向她那最后的聚会。\n　　褐蚁继续攀登，进入了峭壁上的一个圆池，池内光滑的表面上有一个极其复杂的图像，它知道自己那小小的神经网络绝对无力存贮这样的东西，但了解了图像的大概形状后，它又有了对“9”的感觉，原细胞态的美感又萌动了一下。而且它还似乎认出了图像中的一部分，那是一双眼睛，它对眼睛多少有一些敏感，因为被眼睛注视就意味着危险。不过此时它没有什么忧虑，因为它知道这双眼睛没有生命。它已经忘记了那个叫罗辑的巨大的存在在第一次发出声音前蹲下来凝视孤峰上端的情形，当时他凝视的就是这双眼睛。接着，它爬出圆池，攀上峰顶。\n　　在这里。它并没有一览众山小的感觉，因为它不怕从高处坠落，它曾多次被风从比这高得多的地方吹下去，但毫发无损，没有了对高处的恐惧就体会不到高处之美：在孤峰脚下，郡只被罗辑用花柄拂落的蜘蛛开始重建蛛网，它从峭壁上拉出一根晶莹的丝，\n######################\nOutput:",
