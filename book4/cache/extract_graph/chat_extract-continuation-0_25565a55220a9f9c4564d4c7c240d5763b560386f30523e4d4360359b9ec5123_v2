开始了。结婚虽然已经几个月，但他还是等于一个光棍，实际上，这样一种夫妻生活，还不如他打光棍。光棍没有女人的温暖，但也不要受女人的折磨。 \n　　从洞房花烛之夜起到观在，他用尽了甜言蜜语，甚至下跪乞求央告，润叶死活不和他同床。每天晚上，她不脱衣服，在墙角的一张小床上独自睡觉，而把他一个人丢在那张漂亮的双人床上。两个人就象陌生的路人住在同一个旅馆里。李向前夜夜倒在床上流泪、叹息；他真想大声狂叫，又想用拳头把所有的东西砸个稀巴烂……刚结婚的时候，向前以为这是润叶怕羞——大概所有刚结婚的姑娘都是这样。于是他就原谅了润叶的反抗，并且还在内心责备自己操之过急。因此，他晚上强迫自己安分守己地睡在大床上。他想，也许过一段时间，他就会得到妻子的温存——他耐下心等待着这一天的到来……虽然父母亲都是领导干部，但李向前没有一点从政的素质。他喜欢于一种自在的体力活。他在小时候就迷上了开汽车，觉得这工作可以走南闯北，也没人成天跟在身边指手划脚。他想走就走，想停就停，两只手把着方向盘，可以随心所欲把一个庞然大物摆弄得象一只绵羊一般乖顺。司机工作虽然餐风饮露，很辛苦，但人心情畅快呀！ \n　　高中毕业后，他父亲想让他在县革委会机关当干部，但他坚决不干，而给县供销社的一位老司机当了助手。在这方面，他表现得心灵手巧，又能吃下苦，因此不到一年功夫，就考取了驾驶执照，独立开车了。就象实现了一个美梦一般，李向前完全沉醉在了自己的职业中。对待汽车，他一点也不马虎，哪怕为了洗干净一个螺丝帽，他可以把饭丢下不吃。汽车在他的眼里是有生命的。就象爱马的人看见自己的坐骑一样，他每次向自己的汽车走去的时候，心里就有一种抑制不住的激动和亢奋，甚至要温柔地把这个钢铁家伙抚摸一下。 \n　　当然，在其它方面，他也是一个平平凡凡的普通人。他不爱看书，也不关心多少正经八板的社会大事。他喜欢听轶闻趣事，和同行东拉西扯地编一些不上串的话。有时候看起来见识很广，但实际上说的都是些没名堂的事。除过汽车行道，对吃、穿、用的东西他也很在行；炒一手好菜，知道什么衣服正流行，并且极其关注新出现的日用产品。有些玩艺儿他已经用了多时，可原西县的人还没听说过，比如电动刮胡子刀等等。 \n　　但这个身体略嫌发胖的青年，心肠倒并不坏。他不象他这个行道的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LI XIANGQIAN<|>PERSON<|>Li Xiangqian is a young man who feels
