一片海边碧绿的沙地来，上面深蓝的天空中挂着一轮金\n黄的圆月。我想：希望本是无所谓有，无所谓无的。这正如地上的路；其实地上本\n没有路，走的人多了，也便成了路。\n\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九二一年一月。\n\n\n\n□注释\n\n⑴本篇最初发表于一九二一年五月《新青年》第九卷第一号。\n\n⑵猹：作者在一九二九年五月四日致舒新城的信中说：“‘猹’字是我据乡下人所\n说的声音，生造出来的，读如‘查’。……现在想起来，也许是獾罢。”\n\n⑶大祭祀的值年：封建社会中的大家族，每年都有祭祀祖先的活动，费用从族中“\n祭产”收入支取，由各房按年轮流主持，轮到的称为“值年”。\n\n⑷五行缺土：旧社会所谓算“八字”的迷信说法。即用天干（甲乙丙丁戊己庚辛壬\n癸）和地支（子丑寅卯辰巳午未申酉戌亥）相配，来记一个人出生的年、月、日、\n时，各得两字，合为“八字”；又认为它们在五行（金、木、水、火、土）中各有\n所属，如甲乙寅卯属木，丙丁巳午属火等等，如八个字能包括五者，就是五行俱全\n。“五行缺土”，就是这八个字中没有属土的字，需用土或土作偏旁的字取名等办\n法来弥补。\n\n⑸鬼见怕和观音手，都是小贝壳的名称。旧时浙江沿海的人把这种小贝壳用线串在\n一起，戴在孩子的手腕或脚踝上，认为可以“避邪”。这类名称多是根据“避邪”\n的意思取的。\n\n⑹西施：春秋时越国的美女，后来用以泛称一般美女。\n\n⑺拿破仑（１７６９—１８２１）：即拿破仑·波拿巴，法国资产阶级革命时期的\n军事家、政治家。一七九九年担任共和国执政。一八○四年建立法兰西第一帝国，\n自称拿破仑一世。\n\n⑻华盛顿（１７３２—１７９９）：即乔治·华盛顿，美国政治家。他曾领导一七\n七五年至一七八三年美国反对英国殖民统治的独立战争，胜利后任美国第一任总统\n。\n\n⑼道台：清朝官职道员的俗称，分总管一个区域行政职务的道员和专掌某一特定职\n务的道员。前者是省以下、府州以上的行政长官；后者掌管一省特定事务，如督粮\n道、兵备道等。辛亥革命后，北洋军阀政府也曾沿用此制，改称道尹。\n\n\n```\n######################\nOutput:",
