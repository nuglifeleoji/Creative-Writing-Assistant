时年五十九岁。宫中死者数百人。卫瓘曰：“众军各归营所，以待王命。”魏兵争欲报仇，共剖维腹，其胆大如鸡卵。众将又尽取姜维家属杀之。邓艾部下之人，见钟会、姜维已死，遂连夜去追劫邓艾。早有人报知卫瓘。瓘曰：“是我捉艾；今若留他，我无葬身之地矣。”护军田续曰：“昔邓艾取江油之时，欲杀续，得众官告免。今日当报此恨！”瓘大喜，遂遣田续引五百兵赶至绵竹，正遇邓艾父子放出槛车，欲还成都。艾只道是本部兵到，不作准备；欲待问时，被田续一刀斩之。邓忠亦死于乱军之中。后人有诗叹邓艾曰：“自幼能筹画，多谋善用兵。凝眸知地理，仰面识天文。马到山根断，兵来石径分。功成身被害，魂绕汉江云。”又有诗叹钟会曰：“髫年称早慧，曾作秘书郎。妙计倾司马，当时号子房。寿春多赞画，剑阁显鹰扬。不学陶朱隐，游魂悲故乡。”又有诗叹姜维曰：“天水夸英俊，凉州产异才。系从尚父出，术奉武侯来。大胆应无惧，雄心誓不回。成都身死日，汉将有余哀。”\n\n    却说姜维、钟会、邓艾已死，张翼等亦死于乱军之中。太子刘璇、汉寿亭侯关彝，皆被魏兵所杀。军民大乱，互相践踏，死者不计其数。旬日后，贾充先至，出榜安民。方始宁靖。留卫瓘守成都，乃迁后主赴洛阳。止有尚书令樊建、侍中张绍、光禄大夫谯周、秘书郎郤正等数人跟随。廖化、董厥皆托病不起，后皆忧死。\n\n    时魏景元五年改为咸熙元年，春三月，吴将丁奉见蜀已亡，遂收兵还吴。中书丞华覈奏吴主孙休曰：“吴、蜀乃唇齿也，唇亡则齿寒；臣料司马昭伐吴在即，乞陛下深加防御。”休从其言，遂命陆逊子陆抗为镇东大将军，领荆州牧，守江口；左将军孙异守南徐诸处隘口；又沿江一带，屯兵数百营，老将丁奉总督之，以防魏兵。\n\n    建宁太守霍戈闻成都不守，素服望西大哭三日。诸将皆曰：“既汉主失位，何不速降，戈泣谓曰：“道路隔绝，未知吾主安危若何。若魏主以礼待之，则举城而降，未为晚也；万一危辱吾主，则主辱臣死，何可降乎？”众然其言，乃使人到洛阳，探听后主消息去了。\n\n    且说后主至洛阳时，司马昭已自回朝。昭责后主曰\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
