，端屎端尿，洗脸洗身，还要每天用柔言细语安慰他。每当向前因失去双腿而一次次陷入绝望的时候，她就象阿姨一样乖哄他，抚爱他，并且帮助他和自己发生肉体关系，使他重新获得生活的愿望和信心。 \n　　正是在这种自我牺牲和献身之中，润叶自己在精神方面也获得了一些充实。她开始更现实地看待生活。在这种思想的支配下，她对工作的态度也更认真和踏实了。生活的风浪改变了我们的润叶。青春炽热的浆汁停止了喷发，代之而来的是庄严肃穆的山脉。 \n　　我们不由再一次感叹：是该为她遗憾呢？还是该为她欣慰？ \n　　不论我们希望润叶成为怎样的人，但润叶只能是她自己。啊，润叶！难道她不仍然为我们所喜爱吗？ \n　　后来，向前的情绪也渐渐稳定了下来。有时候，他拄着双拐走下楼，在家属院里转悠转悠。星期天，润叶在轮椅上推着他，到黄原城外的山野里玩大半天。他拒绝她推着他去看电影，也不去街上的稠人广众处。她理解他的心情——他怕她受到众人目光的伤害。 \n　　不用说，向前也力尽所能设法体贴她。他本来就是一个很会体贴人的人。有了轮椅以后，他的活动方便了些。她一上班，他就坐着轮椅拿拖把拖地；并且转着把各个房间替她清扫揩抹得干干净净。他坚持把打扫卫生的工作从她手里接替了。他说他有的是时间，一整天无事可干，这点忙总可以帮她的。 \n　　她提拔成少儿部长后，工作一繁忙，有时下班回来就要晚一点，向前对她讲：“干脆让我给咱做饭！你负责把东西买回来就行了，其它你不要管！” \n　　“你能行吗？”她既感动又疑虑地问。 \n　　“保准能行！你又不是不知道，我作饭比你强。你放心去工作！” \n　　她两眼含着泪水笑了。 \n　　那天下班她进门后，向前就把饭菜都做好放在桌上，静静地坐在轮椅里等她。她看见，他象孩子一样，舌头舔着嘴唇，天真地笑着，望着她。泪水从她眼里涌出来了。她走过去，忘情地搂住他结实的脖项，在他脸上亲吻了一下。“我能行吗？”他仰起脸问她。 \n　　“能行！能行！”她亲切地抚摸着他的头发说。从此之后，家务就全由丈夫包揽了。她除去买粮买菜，上班前在厨房里稍微准备一下，其余就都由向前来操持。他乐意干，她也愿意让他干，这样，他会觉得他在生活中还是一个有用的人。 \n　　的确如此，劳动使向前的情绪越来越好了。他有时候还咦�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
