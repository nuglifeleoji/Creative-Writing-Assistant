驮瓷的时候，有一次一家姓陶的窑主家发生了事故，他冒死救了陶窑主的性命。老陶感激他，和他结了拜把兄弟。陶兄一再说，以后他有什么难事就来找他，他一定全力相帮。玉厚当时想，我为什么不把玉亭送到柳林镇去读书呢？ \n　　他立即登门请村里识字的金先生，给山西柳林镇的老拜识写了封信，看他能不能收留他弟去那里读书。老陶很快回了音，说只管把玉亭送来，叫玉厚什么也不要管，这小兄弟的一切都由他全包了。 \n　　就这样，玉厚把玉亭送到了山西柳林镇。 \n　　这期间，他每年都要到柳林去看一回弟弟。临行前，他老婆总要把玉亭一年的穿戴准备齐全，还做许多茶饭让他给玉亭带去。对于他们来说，玉亭不仅是亲人，也是一家人未来的指望啊！ \n　　一九五四年，玉亭初中毕业，到太原钢厂当了工人。玉厚一家人高兴得不知如何是好！虽说玉亭是个工人，但这是孙家多少代第一个在门外干事的人！ \n　　可是一九六○年困难时期，玉亭突然跑回家来，说他一个月的工资不够买一口袋土豆，死活不再回太原去了；他说他要在家乡找个媳妇，参加农业生产呀。 \n　　这可把玉厚急坏了！好说歪说，就是说不转玉亭。玉厚没有办法，只好打问着给他找媳妇。那年头，他家穷得钱没钱，粮没粮，他身边已有了三个孩子，孩子年纪又都小，没什么帮手，尽是连累，一家人时不时都饿得浮肿了。可弟弟已经二十六岁，也的确该娶媳妇了。而玉亭为此还天天给他妈哭鼻子，说他年纪再大，娶不下媳妇，这一辈子就算瞎活了。他母亲也陪着玉亭哭哭啼啼。 \n　　玉厚看玉亭这样没出息，才知道他半辈子辛劳，企图给孙家造就一个光宗耀祖人物的指望落空了。但他心平气静，并不为此而过分地懊悔。是啊，这是命运。正如辛劳一年营务的庄稼，还没等收获，就被冰雹打光了，难道能懊悔自己曾经付出的力气吗？ \n　　好，那就给弟弟娶媳妇吧。他四处疯跑着给玉亭打问对象。但是，所有的人家财礼都要得太高了，他就是把一家人的骨头卖了也出不起。 \n　　在万般焦急中，他又想起了柳林镇的老拜识，于是又写信求他帮忙。 \n　　本来他是有病乱求医，并没抱多大希望，可不久老朋友却热心地回了信，说离柳林镇二里路有一个女子，愿意跟玉亭。老陶说玉亭大概也认识这女娃娃，这女子在柳林镇\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
