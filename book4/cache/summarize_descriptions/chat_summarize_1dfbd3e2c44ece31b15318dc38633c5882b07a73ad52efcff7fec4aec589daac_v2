He is depicted as a man who has recently returned to work as a shoemaker following a divorce from his wife, Lili. Despite his efforts to rebuild his life, he remains deeply attached to another woman, Runye, who is also the wife of his brother-in-law, Runsheng. This complicated relationship with Runye is marked by feelings of torment and despair, as Li Xiangqian struggles with his unreciprocated love and the emotional pressure he places on her, which affects her well-being and relationships.\n\nLi Xiangqian's life is further complicated by his past experiences, including a prison sentence that has left him yearning to return home and reconnect with his loved ones. He expresses a desire to buy gifts for them, indicating a longing for familial bonds and reconciliation. However, his emotional state is fragile, and he often finds solace in alcohol, which exacerbates his feelings of loneliness and despair.\n\nHis relationship with Runye is fraught with conflict, culminating in a violent confrontation that highlights the intensity of his feelings and the strain on their interactions. Li Xiangqian's emotional struggles are palpable, as he contemplates the meaning of his existence and the depths of his unfulfilled desires. He arrives at a bus station, expecting to be welcomed by Runye, only to find himself alone and heartbroken, further emphasizing his sense of isolation.\n\nDespite his kind-hearted nature, as evidenced by his willingness to help pack the belongings of Tian Fujun before a move, Li Xiangqian's life is overshadowed by his internal battles.
