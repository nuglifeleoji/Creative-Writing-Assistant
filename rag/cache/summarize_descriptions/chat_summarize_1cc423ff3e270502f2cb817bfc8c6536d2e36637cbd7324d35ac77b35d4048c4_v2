The Jihad's strict bans on advanced technology, particularly AI and machine-based cognition, shaped the Sisterhood's foundational principles, fostering a deep aversion to such innovations.  \n\nFollowing the Jihad, the Bene Gesserit established themselves as a mental-physical training school, honing human potential to compensate for the absence of machine assistance. Their reliance on human intellect and physical discipline was further reinforced by the destruction of thinking machines, leading them to preserve knowledge through their **Archives** rather than relying on technological repositories.  \n\nThe legacy of the Butlerian Jihad profoundly influenced the Sisterhood's policies, including strict prohibitions against artificial reproduction methods and cyborg technology. Their wariness of technological overreach is exemplified by their distrust of factions like the **Ixians**, who continued to develop advanced machinery despite the Jihad's restrictions. The Bene Gesserit's long-term strategies and political maneuvers are deeply rooted in the historical context of the Jihad, which they reference as a cautionary tale against the dangers of unchecked technological progress.  \n\nIn summary, the Bene Gesserit's rise to prominence, their ideological foundations, and their operational methodologies are inextricably linked to the Butlerian Jihad, which not only eradicated thinking machines but also instilled a lasting cultural and philosophical resistance to artificial intelligence and its derivatives.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251885, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 661, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 287}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
