While it is used as a punishment post for Bene Gesserit members, it also plays a vital role in smuggling operations and resource gathering, making it a key location in their network.  \n\nThough the Honored Matres pose a threat, Buzzell endures as one of the few planets still firmly held by the Bene Gesserit. Its dual nature—as both a disciplinary site and a logistical hub—highlights the sisterhood’s adaptability in maintaining control over critical assets, even under external pressure.
