\n　　孙少平强迫自己平静下来，冷静下来；因为潜意识提醒他，还有一些具体事需要办理，而时间已经很紧迫了！他坐在凳子上，低倾下头，两个手指头叉着闭住的眼窝，让自己的思想集中起来。是的，他应该在这一两天内为妹妹做点准备……当然，父母亲和哥哥嫂子也会为妹妹操办出门的行程；但有些事他们想不到。对，他首先应该为兰香买一只漂亮的人造革皮箱。这是门面。箱子要尽量大一点，能容纳所有的零七碎八。色彩要鲜艳而不俗气……想起来了！百货一门市的那种最好。要拐角处黄红条格相间的那种——不知还有没有？ \n　　还要给她买三套夏衣：两件短袖，一件长袖衬衣。省城听说夏天特别热，多买一件短袖。罩衣不买了，热天用不着——等他到煤矿后再给她买也来及得。 \n　　另外，还有香皂、牙膏、牙刷、手帕、面霜、凉鞋、袜子…… \n　　少平一边思考要给妹妹买的东西，一边同时计算所需要的钱。他身上仍然有一百多元。他自己买东西用掉的是夏令营赚的工资；过去的工钱给家里寄过所剩下的，一分钱也没动。本来这钱是他准备初到矿上应急用的——但现在他准备全部给妹妹花销完！ \n　　他突然想到，还有几件女孩子最重要的用品要买。本来，这些东西应该由母亲为妹妹准备，可一个农村老太太绝对不可能备办这件事。哥哥嫂嫂大概也不会想到。他们只知道农村的习惯…… \n　　是的，他应该给妹妹买几条内裤，两个乳罩，几条卫生带…… \n　　孙少平十分周详地想好了他要给妹妹买的全部东西；然后再一次估算了费用，觉得他身上的钱足够。 \n　　本来他马上就准备到街上去置办这些物品。但又一想，应该让晓霞给他参谋一下；女孩子的东西应该由女孩子来买，才能确切知道买什么更好更合适。 \n　　第二天，晓霞听少平说他妹妹考进赫赫有名的北方工业大学后，大吃了一惊。她简直难以相信一个农村姑娘能考进这样的大学，而且学的还是天体物理！ \n　　晓霞马上兴奋地陪少平到街上去为兰香买东西。所有买到的东西他都相当满意。 \n　　当少平让晓霞为妹妹买那几件女孩子的必需品时，晓霞忍不住眼里含满了泪水——她被少平能这样周到地体贴人而深受感动…… \n　　按金波说好的时间，兰香和金秀今天就要到达黄原。 \n　　一吃过早饭，少平就提着为妹妹准备好生活用品的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
