\n　　秀莲太过分了！先前给他碗里捞稠饭，现在又把奶奶的白面馍拿来让他吃，这简直不能再让人容忍！ \n　　少安匆忙地把自己饭碗里的黑面馍吃完，又把吃饱的猪吆到圈里拦好，就端着那个白面馍回到窑里。 \n　　他脸阴沉沉地把那个白面馍又放回到馍篮里，一句话也没说，转身就往门外走。本来他还没吃饱，但连稀饭黑面馍也不想再吃了。这件令他难堪而痛心的事，已使他无法继续在窑里呆下去。 \n　　在他出门的时候，母亲拿起那个白画馍追出来，偷声缓气地说：“死小子！这是妈让秀莲给你拿的！” \n　　少安头也不回地只管往出走。他知道，母亲这样做，是为了让秀莲好下台。 \n　　他出了院子的时候，听见窑里传来秀莲的痛哭声。哭就哭吧！谁让你把事情做得这样令人失望！ \n　　少安第一次没有和妻子一块相跟着回饲养院他们的家。 \n　　他心烦意乱地一个人回到田家圪崂这面，进了自己住的窑洞，连鞋也没脱，就倒在了土炕的铺盖卷上。 \n　　少安的额头象感冒一般发热。他第一次感到了成家后的烦恼。 \n　　是的，这是一个征兆。随着秀莲进了家门，矛盾已经开始露了头。他多少年和父母弟妹生死与共，秀莲即使是因为爱他而伤害了家里的人他也不能原谅。他是一个成熟的庄稼人，绝对不会象农村的有些年轻人，如俗话说的“娶了媳妇忘了娘”。不！牺牲自己而全力支撑这个穷家，这是他多年来的一贯信念，已经成了他的生活哲学。也正因为如此，他才没有从无数艰难与困苦之中垮下来，甚至因而感到自己活得还有点意思…… \n　　天很晚的时候，秀莲才一个人进了家门。少安知道她回来了，也没睁开眼看她。 \n　　他感觉熟悉的，温热的手在他腿上轻轻碰了一下——不是无意，而是专意碰的。 \n　　他睁开眼睛。 \n　　血立刻呼然地再一次涌到了他的头上！ \n　　他看见，秀莲立在他面前，竟然在手帕里包了两个白面馍，给他递过来，正等着他坐起来接呢！ \n　　他气愤地一闪身坐起来，大声说：“你怎么能这样不懂事呢？” \n　　秀莲看来也生气了，说：“这是妈让我给你拿的！” \n　　她说的当然是实话。在他甩手一走，秀莲难为情地哭了以后，婆婆、公公和兰香劝说了她半天。公公还怒气冲冲地准备到饲养院来教训儿子，被兰香\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
