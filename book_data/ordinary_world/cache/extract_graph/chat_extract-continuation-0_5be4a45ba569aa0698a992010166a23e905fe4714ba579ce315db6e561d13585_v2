\n　　伤势显然是严重的。看来伤者被压住后，在浅昏迷中曾试图挣扎着拼命往出拉自己的腿，因此将血管、神经和肌肉全部撕裂。要保住两条腿，也许只有显微外科还有点希望——但地区医院哪有这等设备和条件？ \n　　唯一的办法只能是截肢！ \n　　在血管没有结扎之前，卫生局长李登云十分火急直接找到了医院院长。 \n　　院长一听局长娃娃的腿被压坏了，立刻将医院的正副主任医师，正副主治医师全部带进了手术室，——院长本人也是外科的副主任医师。 \n　　李登云已经顾不了体统，在院长等人进手术室之前，捶胸顿足地哭着说：“我就这一个儿子呀！你们无论如何要把他的两条腿保住！” \n　　手术室的门关闭以后，李登云被卫生局的干事和小车司机一个人架着一条胳膊，靠在走道的墙壁上。 \n　　可怜的登云浑身已经瘫软得无法站立。他大张着嘴巴，惊恐地看着手术室的两扇门，等待着儿子的命运。“要不要到市医院把刘书记接来？”卫生局的司机对李登云说。 \n　　“先不要！”李登云痛苦地摇摇头，“先不要叫他妈知道……” \n　　一位护士拿来把椅子，让李局长先坐着等一等。 \n　　不一会，院长和主任医师从手术室里出来了。李登云紧张地观察着这两个人的脸色——他从他们的脸色上看出事情有些不妙。 \n　　这两个人戴着大口罩走到他面前，用手示意让局长不要从椅子上立起来。 \n　　穿白大褂的院长这时在上级面前已经是一副专业人员的严肃面孔。他对局长说：“根据我们检查诊断，已经没办法再转省医院进行显微外科。第一，断肢和肢体离开时间太长，没有冰冻措施，无法再植。第二，血管和神经创面模糊，无法吻合，如再转送省院，恐怕有生命危险……” \n　　“那就是说要把腿锯掉？”登云绝望地问。 \n　　“是的，马上要施行截肢手术。”主任医师说。“能不能留下一条腿？”李登云又哭着问。 \n　　院长和主任医师都摇摇头。 \n　　这时，一位主治医师拿来了“医院术前谈话记录单”，让家属签字。李登云颤抖着半天才写上了自己的名字。手术室的门再一次关闭了。 \n　　李登云一个马趴晕倒在了地上。他的两个下属赶紧把他也抬进了急诊室…… \n                  第48章\n　　在地区医院的急诊室里，李登云在儿子刚躺过的那张小床上，好不容易才缓过气来。 \n　　看他挣扎着要下床，卫生局的干事和小车司机，就把他扶到\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>李向前<|>PERSON<|>李向前 is
