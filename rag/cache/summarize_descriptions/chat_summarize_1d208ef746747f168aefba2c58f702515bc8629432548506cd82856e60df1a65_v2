As part of a strategic and diplomatic gesture, Duncan was exchanged with the Fremen, signaling the beginning of a deeper alliance between the two groups. His presence among the Fremen not only demonstrated the Atreides' commitment to cooperation but also allowed him to integrate into their culture, earning their respect.  \n\nLater, Duncan took on a leadership role in negotiations between the Atreides and the Fremen, working to secure their support for House Atreides' broader objectives. His unique position—having lived among the Fremen while maintaining his loyalty to the Atreides—made him an effective intermediary. This dual role highlights his importance as both a diplomat and a warrior, bridging the gap between the two factions.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Duncan Idaho's significance in strengthening ties between the Atreides and the Fremen, first through symbolic exchange and later through active negotiation.
