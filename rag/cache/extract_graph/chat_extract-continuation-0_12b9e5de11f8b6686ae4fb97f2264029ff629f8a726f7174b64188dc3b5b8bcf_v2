There is always a market for data about Reverend Mothers.\nHis mother explained: “You judge the questioner and fit your responses according to the susceptibilities.” None of this would have served against a full Reverend Mother, but against an acolyte, especially this one!\nFor Carlana, he produces an appearance of coy reluctance. Carlana has an inflated view of her own attractions. He allows her to overcome his reluctance after a suitable marshaling of her forces. What she gets is a handful of lies, which, if she ever repeats them to the SI behind that closed door, are sure to win Carlana a severe censuring if not something more painful.\nWords from Dit, Dat, and Dot: “| think we have him now.”\nTeg recognized Yar’s voice yanking him out of old memories. “Fit your responses according to the susceptibilities.” Teg heard the words in his mother’s voice.\nPuppets.\nPuppet masters.\nThe functionary speaks: “Ask the simulation where they have taken the ghola.”\nSilence and then a faint humming.\n“I’m not getting anything.” Yar.\nTeg hears their voices with painful sensitivity. He forces his eyes to open against the opposing commands of the probe.\n“Look!” Yar says.\nThree sets of eyes stare back at Teg. How slowly they move. Dit, Dat, and Dot: the eyes go blink... blink... at least a minute between blinks. Yar is reaching for something on his console. His fingers will take a week to reach their destination.\nTeg explores the bindings on his hands and arms. Ordinary rope! Taking his time, he squirms his fingers into contact with the knots. They loosen, slowly at first, and then\nflying apart. He moves on to the straps holding him to the Sling litter. These are easier: simple slip locks. Yar’s hand is not even a fourth of the way to the console.\nBlink... blink... blink...\nThe three sets of eyes show faint surprise.\nTeg releases himself from the medusa tangle of probe contacts. Pop-pop-pop! The grippers fly away from him. He is Surprised to notice a slow start of bleeding on the back of his right hand where it has brushed the probe contacts aside.\nMentat projection: /am moving with dangerous speed.\nBut now he is off the litter. Functionary is reaching a slow- slow hand toward a bulge in a side pocket. Teg’s hand crushes the functionary’s throat. Functionary will never again touch that little lasgun he always carries. Yar’s outstretched hand is still not a third of the way to the probe console. There is definite surprise in his eyes, though. Teg doubts that the man even sees the hand that breaks his neck. Materly is moving a bit faster. Her left foot is coming toward where Teg had been just the flick of an instant previously. Still too slow! Materly’s head is thrown back, the throat exposed for Teg’s down-chopping hand.\nHow slowly they fall to the floor!\nTeg became aware of perspiration pouring from him but he could not spare time to worry about this.\n| knew every move they would make before they made it! What has happened to me?\nMentat projection: The probe agony has lifted me to a new level of ability.\nIntense hunger pangs made him aware of the energy drain. He pushed the sensation aside, feeling himself return to a normal time-beat. Three dull sounds: bodies falling to the floor.\nTeg examined the probe console. Definitely not Ixian. Similar controls, though. He shorted out the data storage system, erasing it.\nRoom lights?\nControls beside the door from the outside. He extinguished the lights, took three deep breaths. A whirling blur of motion erupted into the night.\nThe ones who had brought him here, clad in their bulky clothing against the winter chill, barely had time to turn toward the odd sound before the whirling blur struck them down.\nTeg returned to normal time-beat more quickly. Starlight showed him a trail leading downslope through thick brush. He slipped and slid on the snow-churned mud for a space and then found the way to balance himself, anticipating the terrain. Each step went where he knew it must go. He found himself presently in an open space that looked out across a valley.\nThe lights of a city and a great black rectangle of building near the center. He knew this place: Ysai. The puppet masters were there.\nlam free!\nThere was a man who Sat each day looking out through a narrow vertical opening where a single board had been removed from a tall wooden fence. Each day a wild ass of the desert passed outside the fence and across the narrow opening—first the nose, then the head, the forelegs, the long brown back, the hindlegs, and lastly the tail. One day, the man leaped to his feet with the light of discovery in his eyes and he shouted for all who could hear him: “It is obvious! The nose causes the tail!”\n—STORIES OF THE HIDDEN WISDOM, FROM THE ORAL HISTORY OF RAKIS\nS everal times since coming to Rakis, Odrade had found herself caught in the memory of that ancient painting which occupied such a prominent place on the wall of Taraza’s Chapter House quarters. When the memory came, She felt her hands tingle to the touch of the brush. Her nostrils swelled to the induced smells of oils and pigments. Her emotions assaulted the canvas. Each time, Odrade emerged from the memory with new doubts that Sheeana was her canvas.\nWhich of us paints the other?\nIt had happened again this morning. Still dark outside the Rakian Keep’s penthouse where she quartered with Sheeana: An acolyte entered softly to waken Odrade and tell her that Taraza would arrive shortly. Odrade looked up at the softly illuminated face of the dark-haired acolyte and immediately that memory-painting flashed into her awareness.\nWhich of us truly creates another?\n“Let Sheeana sleep a bit longer,” Odrade said before dismissing the acolyte.\n“Will you breakfast before the Mother Superior’s arrival?” the acolyte asked.\n“We will wait upon Taraza’s pleasure.”\nArising, Odrade went through a swift toilet and donned her best black robe. She strode then to the east window of the penthouse common room and looked out in the direction of the spacefield. Many moving lights cast a glow on the dusty sky there. She activated all of the room’s glowglobes to soften the exterior view. The globes became reflected golden starbursts on the thick armor-plaz of the windows. The dusky surface also reflected a dim outline of her own features, showing the fatigue lines clearly.\n| knew she would come, Odrade thought.\nEven as she thought this, the Rakian sun came over the dust-blurred horizon like a child’s orange ball thrust into view. Immediately, there was the heat-bounce that so many observers of Rakis had mentioned. Odrade turned away from the view and saw the hall door open.\nTaraza entered with a rustle of robes. A hand closed the door behind her, leaving the two of them alone. The Mother Superior advanced on Odrade, black hood up and the cowl framing her face. It was not a reassuring sight.\nRecognizing the disturbance in Odrade, Taraza played on it. “Well, Dar, | think we finally meet as strangers.”\nThe effect of Taraza’s words startled Odrade. She correctly interpreted the threat but fear left her, spilling out as though it were water poured from a jug. For the first time in her life, Odrade recognized the precise moment of crossing a dividing line. This was a line whose existence she thought few of her Sisters suspected. As she crossed it, she realized that she had always known it was there: a place where she could enter the void and float free. She no longer was vulnerable. She could be killed but she could not be defeated.\n“So it’s not Dar and Tar anymore,” Odrade said.\nTaraza heard the clear, uninhibited tone of Odrade’s voice and interpreted this as confidence. “Perhaps it never was Dar and Tar,” she said, her voice icy. “| see that you think you have been extremely clever.”\nThe battle has been joined, Odrade thought. But / do not stand in the path of her attack.\nOdrade said: “The alternatives to alliance with the Tleilaxu could not be accepted. Especially when | recognized what it was you truly sought for us.”\nTaraza felt suddenly weary. It had been a long trip despite the space-folding leaps of her no-ship. The flesh always knew when it had been twisted out of its familiar rhythms. She chose a soft divan and sat down, sighing in the luxurious comfort.\nOdrade recognized the Mother Superior’s fatigue and felt immediate sympathy. They were suddenly two Reverend Mothers with common problems.\nTaraza obviously sensed this. She patted the cushion beside her and waited for Odrade to be seated.\n“We must preserve the Sisterhood,” Taraza said. “That is the only important thing.”\n“Of course.”\nTaraza fixed her gaze searchingly on Odrade’s familiar features. Yes, Odrade, too, is weary. “You have been here, intimately touching the people and the problem,” Taraza said. “I want. . . no, Dar, | need your views.”\n“The Tleilaxu give the appearance of full cooperation,” Odrade said, “but there is dissembling in this. | have begun to ask myself some extremely disturbing questions.”\n“Such as?”\n“What if the axlotl tanks are not... tanks?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Waff reveals the kinds of behavior you see when a family tries to conceal a deformed child or a mad uncle. | swear to you, he is embarrassed when we begin to touch on the tanks.”\n“But what could they possibly .. .”\n“Surrogate mothers.”\n“But they would have to be...” Taraza fell silent, shocked by the possibilities this question opened.\n“Who has ever seen a Tleilaxu female?” Odrade asked.\nTaraza’s mind was filled with objections: “But the precise chemical control, the need to limit variables...” She threw her hood back and shook her hair free. “You are correct: we must question everything. This, though... this is monstrous.”\n“He is still not telling the full truth about our ghola.”\n“What does he say?”\n“No more than what | have already reported: a variation on the original Duncan Idaho and meeting all of the prana- bindu requirements we specified.”\n“That does not explain why they killed or tried to kill our previous purchases.”\n“He swears the holy oath of the Great Belief that they acted out of shame because the eleven previous gholas did not live up to expectations.”\n“How could they know? Does he suggest they have spies among...”\n“He swears not. | taxed him with this and he said that a successful ghola would be sure to create a visible disturbance among us.”\n“What visible disturbance? What is he...”\n“He will not say. He returns each time to the claim that they have met their contractual obligations. Where is the ghola, Tar?”\n“What... oh. On Gammu.”\n“I hear rumors of...”\n“Burzmali has the situation well in hand.” Taraza closed her mouth tightly, hoping that was the truth. The most recent report did not fill her with confidence.\n“You obviously are debating whether to have the ghola killed,” Odrade said.\n“Not just the ghola!”\nOdrade smiled. “Then it’s true that Bellonda wants me permanently eliminated.”\n“How did you...”\n“Friendships can be a very valuable asset at times, Tar.”\n“You tread\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>REVEREND MOTHERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of highly trained and influential women with advanced mental and physical abilities, often involved in political and spiritual matters.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARLANA<|>PERSON<|>A character with an inflated view of her own attractions, who interacts with others in a manipulative manner.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>A skilled individual who demonstrates extraordinary abilities, including heightened perception and physical prowess, possibly due to external stimuli like a probe.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAR<|>PERSON<|>A functionary involved in the interrogation or monitoring of Teg, using a probe console.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIT, DAT, AND DOT<|>PERSON<|>A trio of individuals observing Teg during his interrogation, showing slow reactions to his movements.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATERLY<|>PERSON<|>An individual involved in the confrontation with Teg, moving slowly compared to his enhanced speed.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNCTIONARY<|>PERSON<|>An official involved in the interrogation of Teg, carrying a lasgun and ultimately defeated by Teg.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YSAI<|>GEO<|>A city with a prominent black rectangle of a building, known to Teg as the location of the puppet masters.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>A planet where Odrade and Sheeana are located, known for its dusty environment and heat-bounce effect.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>The Mother Superior of the Sisterhood, involved in high-level decisions and interactions with Odrade.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>A Reverend Mother who interacts with Taraza and Sheeana, involved in strategic and political decisions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>A significant individual under the care of Odrade, possibly central to the Sisterhood's plans.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group known for their genetic engineering, including the creation of gholas, and involved in complex dealings with the Sisterhood.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>A Tleilaxu representative who interacts with Odrade, revealing but also concealing information about their practices.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A ghola created by the Tleilaxu, meeting specific requirements set by the Sisterhood.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Sisterhood who may advocate for the elimination of Odrade.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURZMALI<|>PERSON<|>An individual tasked with handling the situation involving the ghola on Gammu.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A location where the ghola Duncan Idaho is being held or monitored.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>YAR<|>Teg overpowers Yar during his escape, breaking his neck.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>MATERLY<|>Teg defeats Materly in a confrontation, exploiting her slow movements.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>FUNCTIONARY<|>Teg kills the functionary during his escape, preventing him from using a lasgun.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>YSAI<|>Teg recognizes Ysai as the location of the puppet masters.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TARAZA<|>Odrade and Taraza engage in a strategic and tense conversation about the Sisterhood's future.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade is responsible for Sheeana's care and is deeply involved in her role within the Sisterhood.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TLEILAXU<|>Odrade interacts with the Tleilaxu, questioning their motives and practices.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>WAFF<|>Odrade questions Waff about the Tleilaxu's axlotl tanks and the ghola Duncan Idaho.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BELLONDA<|>Taraza is aware of Bellonda's desire to eliminate Odrade.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BURZMALI<|>Taraza relies on Burzmali to handle the ghola situation on Gammu.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Tleilaxu created the ghola Duncan Idaho as part of their agreement with the Sisterhood.<|>8\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
