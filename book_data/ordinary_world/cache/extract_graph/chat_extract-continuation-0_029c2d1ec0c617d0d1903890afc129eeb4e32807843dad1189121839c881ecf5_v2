\n　　我们真没有想到，玉亭在新形势下仍然可以发挥自己的“特长”。我们更想不到，他这次竟然利用这特长为“资本主义”鸣锣击鼓！无论如何，这孙玉亭还是孙玉亭，虽说“政治”不同以往，但革命热情未减半分！ \n　　当孙玉亭给乡长送上请柬，并眉飞色舞描绘了他将为侄儿设计的“点火仪式”后，刘根民也有点激动了。乡长恍然大悟地说：“是呀，少安的确是咱们石圪节乡的好典型！这样，玉亭你把给县上的请柬放下，我现在就给周县长打个电话，争取让县上最少来个乡镇企业局的副局长参加这个点火仪式！” \n　　孙玉亭眼巴巴地看着刘乡长给周县长打完电话。刘根民放下话筒，咧开嘴笑着说：“你回去给少安传话，到时周县长要亲自来参加他砖场的点火仪式哩！” \n　　孙玉亭惊得目瞪口呆，兴奋得使他浑身冒起一层鸡皮疙瘩。他拖拉起破鞋就往回跑，一路上绊了好几个马趴……啊啊！县长也要来？孙少安一听事情闹了这么大，心里又高兴又焦急。高兴的是，他似乎真的成了个人物，连县长也要来上他的门。焦急的是，他怎样才能把这个“仪式”搞好，千万不敢闹出什么笑话来！ \n　　少安和妻子一商量，便把在他这里做工的婆姨女子都抽出来，在他二妈和秀莲共同指挥下，碾米磨面，紧急准备待客的茶饭。与此同时，玉亭马不停蹄地跑着乡上联系好一场电影，准备“点火仪式”结束后的当天晚上放映。 \n　　临近点火的头一天，秀莲喂肥的那头猪也在他们新家的院畔上被宰倒了…… \n　　这消息一时三刻就传遍了全村。几天来，双水村大人娃娃都早就议论着孙少安的点火仪式，热心地等待这一天的到来。 \n　　这一天终于来临了。双水村又一次沉浸在节目般的气氛中。许多庄稼人今天都不再出山，纷纷赶到村子南头孙少安新建的院落及其新建的砖场，准备观看这新时代的新把戏。 \n　　孙玉亭凭借丰富的想象力，用一把破扫帚做好了一个火把，并且浇了一瓶煤油，以便在那个庄严的时刻点燃炉火。 \n　　中午前后，石圪节原武装专干、现任副乡长杨高虎，率领乡上所有在机关的干部，先一步赶到了双水村。高虎不是生人，当年双水村搞农田基建大会战时，他就是副总指挥；并且曾协助公社主任徐治功镇压过孙玉亭和王彩娥“麻糊事件”引起的那场大动乱。两年前还来这里搞过生产责任制。 \n　　高虎一到，撇下其他人\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
