谋士审配进曰：“吕布，豺虎也：若得兖州，必图冀州。不若助操攻之，方可无患。”绍遂遣颜良将兵五万，往助曹操。细作探知这个消息，飞报吕布。布大惊，与陈宫商议。宫曰：“闻刘玄德新领徐州，可往投之。”布从其言，竟投徐州来。有人报知玄德。玄德曰：“布乃当今英勇之士，可出迎之。”糜竺曰：“吕布乃虎狼之徒，不可收留；收则伤人矣。”玄德曰：“前者非布袭兖州，怎解此郡之祸。今彼穷而投我，岂有他心！”张飞曰：“哥哥心肠忒好。虽然如此，也要准备。”\n\n

玄德领众出城三十里，接着吕布，并马入城。都到州衙厅上，讲礼毕，坐下。布曰：“某自与王司徒计杀董卓之后，又遭傕、汜之变，飘零关东，诸侯多不能相容。近因曹贼不仁，侵犯徐州，蒙使君力救陶谦，布因袭兖州以分其势；不料反堕奸计，败兵折将。今投使君，共图大事，未审尊意如何？”玄德曰：“陶使君新逝，无人管领徐州，因令备权摄州事。今幸将军至此，合当相让”遂将牌印送与吕布。吕布却待要接，只见玄德背后关、张二公各有怒色。布乃佯笑曰：“量吕布一勇夫，何能作州牧乎？”玄德又让。陈宫曰：“强宾不压主，请便君勿疑。”玄德方止。遂设宴相待，收拾宅院安下。次日，吕布回席请玄德，玄德乃与关、张同往。饮酒至半酣，布请玄德入后堂，关、张随入。布令妻女出拜玄德。玄德再三谦让。布曰：“贤弟不必推让。”张飞听了，瞋目大叱曰：“我哥哥是金枝玉叶，你是何等人，敢称我哥哥为贤弟！你来！我和你斗三百合！”玄德连忙喝住，关公劝飞出。玄德与吕布陪话曰：“劣弟酒后狂言，兄勿见责。”布默然无语。须臾席散。布送玄德出门，张飞跃马横枪而来，大叫：“吕布！我和你并三百合！”玄德急令关公劝止。\n\n
