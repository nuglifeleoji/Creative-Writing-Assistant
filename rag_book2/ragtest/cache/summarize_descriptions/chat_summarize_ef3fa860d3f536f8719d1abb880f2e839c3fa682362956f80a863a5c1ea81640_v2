He is a graduate of 永明大学 (Eimei University), where he served as the vice president of the social dance club, and he initially fell in love with Yukiho at first sight, leading to a four-year courtship before their marriage. At the time of their engagement, Makoto was preparing for their wedding while secretly harboring feelings for another woman, 三泽千都留 (Misawa Chizuru), with whom he later develops an ambiguous relationship, even taking her to the 公园美景酒店 (Park View Hotel).  \n\nProfessionally, Makoto works at 东西电装 (Tōzai Densō) and is involved in investigating potential plagiarism related to a metal processing expert system. He comes from the affluent 高宫 (Takamiya) family, inheriting multiple properties, yet he feels insecure about Yukiho’s professional success and domestic competence. Their marriage is marked by tension, as Makoto resents Yukiho’s work commitments, neglect of household duties, and stock investments, though he occasionally relents out of guilt or sympathy. He also struggles with alcohol, and there are implications of drunken violence toward Yukiho, though he has no memory of such incidents.  \n\nPersonality-wise, Makoto is passive, prone to dissatisfaction, and often feels he has overlooked critical aspects of his life, particularly in his relationship with Yukiho. He takes golf lessons with Chizuru, despite having little interest or skill in the sport, reflecting his internal conflict between duty and desire. His sense of responsibility initially drives him to marry Yukiho, but he later grapples with regret and unresolved emotions, particularly regarding Chizuru, whom he struggles to reconnect with.  \n\nIn summary, Makoto is a conflicted figure—torn between societal expectations, familial pressures, and personal longing—whose marriage to Yukiho deteriorates amid resentment, insecurity, and external temptations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754879512, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 441, "prompt_tokens": 454, "total_tokens": 895, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 390}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
