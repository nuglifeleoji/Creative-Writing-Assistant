Described as a giant and terrifying figure, the Devil possesses a painful and resentful expression, reflecting the narrator's inner turmoil and the consequences of his actions. This creature is characterized as barbaric and cruel, having suffered greatly, which adds depth to its tragic existence.\n\nThe Devil serves as a symbol of the narrator's internal struggles, representing the disasters and pain that arise from his own choices. It is a being that embodies evil traits, yet it also harbors a deep yearning to share life with its creator, highlighting a profound sense of loneliness and despair. This duality makes the Devil not just a mere antagonist but a tragic figure that evokes both fear and sympathy.\n\nIn the narrative, the Devil poses a direct threat to Victor, particularly ominous on his wedding night, suggesting a looming presence that seeks to disrupt and destroy. This threat underscores the Devil's role as a harbinger of chaos and vengeance, as it symbolizes the narrator's own hatred and desire for retribution.
