经过了一段时间的平稳，蓝潇和南澄对娜娜也算是放心下来。娜娜的生活实在是太简单了，吃的很少，除了教蓝轩宇之外，就是回自己房间，要么就是看着窗外发呆。\n\n    周末，当蓝潇和南澄带蓝轩宇出去玩的时候，邀请她她也不去，只是留在家里。\n\n    蓝轩宇跟娜娜的感情一直都在升温，大多数孩子都不会太喜欢学习和修炼，毕竟，这是个枯燥的过程。\n\n    可是，娜娜来了之后，蓝轩宇总会觉得和她一起修炼是一件特别快乐的事情。娜娜总会有办法吸引他的注意力，用各种方式来引导他。\n\n    修炼变得愉快了，自然效果也就更好。除了魂力依旧提升缓慢之外，其他方面都有了不小的进步。\n\n    娜娜每天都会出去一次，回来的时候就会带回来一些高级食材。从何而来蓝潇和南澄也不知道。但想来娜娜可是一位封号斗罗，弄到高级食材也很正常。毕竟是给自己儿子吃，而且在蓝潇有一次确认了娜娜带回来的食材有多么珍贵之后，也就不再说给钱的事情了。因为他们根本支付不起啊！\n\n    就这样，蓝轩宇的假期结束了。\n\n    对他来说，这绝对是一个开心的假期，去了天斗星，坐了宇宙飞船，还带回来一个这么好的家庭老师。\n\n    “娜娜老师，我要去上学啦。您还会教我吗？”蓝轩宇抱着娜娜的大腿，可怜兮兮的抬头看着她。\n\n    “会的。老师在家等你。”娜娜温柔的摸摸他的头。\n\n    “太好啦。娜娜老师，我好喜欢你哦。抱我、抱我。”\n\n    娜娜把他抱起来，蓝轩宇已经凑上去，在她脸上“吧唧”亲了一口。\n\n    娜娜微微一愣，但眼神仿佛已经溶化了，用自己的面颊贴贴蓝轩宇的面颊。\n\n    “轩宇，咱们要走了，不然会迟到的。”蓝潇扭过头去，强忍着不让自己出现嫉妒儿子的情绪。毕竟，那么一个大美女天天在家，那吸引力实在是有种难以抗拒的感觉。\n\n    还好，儿子上学之后，他也要启程参与探索之旅了。\n\n    一直目送着蓝轩宇离开，娜娜才回了自己的房间，关上房门，在床上盘膝坐下，双眸闭合，整个人都进入到了安静的状态。\n\n    一个假期过去，对于儿童天性的孩子来说，其实还会有些期待到学校。\n\n    蓝轩宇下了车，和蓝潇说了再见后就迫不及待的走进了校门。\n\n    一年级二班班主任秋雨馨在班级门口等着，每天早上她都\n######################\nOutput:",
