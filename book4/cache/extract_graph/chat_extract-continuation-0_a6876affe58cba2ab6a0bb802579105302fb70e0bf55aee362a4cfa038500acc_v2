�冰家帮他老婆准备这顿饭了，因此他想让润叶也去凑个热闹。田福军鼓动让侄女去，润叶就答应下来。杜正贤因为女儿和女婿都已经在贾冰家，因此推辞说他还要给田书记汇报文化方面的工作，谢绝了贾冰的邀请…… \n　　润叶和贾老师簇拥着黑老出了地委大院，一块相跟着来到诗人家。 \n　　他们进家以后，一切都已经准备好了。一张红油漆炕桌上，摆满了各种调料。贾冰和丽丽的男朋友武惠良先陪黑老喝酒；润叶和丽丽帮贾冰的爱人往桌子上端菜。 \n　　当一盆子大块羊肉上来后，贾冰硬拉润叶和丽丽也坐下来吃，让他老婆一个人去忙。黑老是个乐和人，开玩笑要和贾冰的爱人碰一杯酒；但这位腼腆的妇女红着脸退出了房间。诗人尴尬地对黑老说：“我老婆是个‘土耳其’！她怕生人，请黑老不要介意。”说完这句话后，诗人借着几杯酒落肚，竟动情地给客人讲起了他和他老婆的爱情故事。 \n　　他告诉大家，他老婆一个字也不识。他们是同村，又是邻居。在他上大学时，他把唯一的亲人老母亲一个人丢在家，全靠他现在的爱人照料。但那时他们什么关系也不是，只是同村邻舍。他当时已经在大学爱上了同班一位城市姑娘。可是后来他母亲非让他和现在的这个爱人结婚不可；说如果他不答应这件事，她就要一头碰死在他面前。他没有办法，只好在爱情和孝心之间选择了后者。结婚以后，他才知道，在那些困难的岁月，当时他爱人为了照顾他妈，偷拿自己家里的东西，曾经挨过她父亲的打骂……天长日久，他觉得他爱人是世界上最好的女人。现在，他老婆办了营业执照，在二道街上卖羊杂碎，起早贪黑，为他操持家庭，还给他生了三个小子。他的工资月月花得净光，家庭全凭老婆来养活；他有时还跑到市场上向老婆要零花钱哩……冲动的诗人说得泪水满面，弄得客人也都吃不成饭了。“我们是先结婚后恋爱……唉，我现在最大的愿望是明年天暖后，带着我老婆去逛一回省城！我要把她引到皇后王后的陵墓前，说：我老婆和你们一样伟大！” \n　　诗人又立刻破涕为笑，赶紧招呼客人吃他的“土耳其”老婆做的荞面圪凸羊腥汤——于是众人也都笑了。 \n　　但润叶没有笑。她一直沉默地听诗人说他和他爱人的故事。唉，不幸的人最怕听别人说他们的幸福！ \n　　吃完饭后，润叶说她有点事，就一个人先离开了诗\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
