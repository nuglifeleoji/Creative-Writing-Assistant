She experienced a momentary distrust of Tecrube at the prying curiosity in the stare he sent after Paul.\n“I speak for my brother today,” she said. “Have the Supplicants approach one at a time.”\n“Yes, m’Lady.” He turned to arrange his throng.\n“I can remember a time when you wouldn’t have mistaken your brother’s purpose here,” Stilgar said.\n“I was distracted,” she said. “There’s been a dramatic change in you, Stil. What is it?”\nStilgar drew himself up, shocked. One changed, of course. But dramatically? This was a particular view of himself that he’d never encountered. Drama was a questionable thing. Imported entertainers of dubious loyalty and more dubious virtue were dramatic. Enemies of the Empire employed drama in their attempts to sway the fickle populace. Korba\nhad slipped away from Fremen virtues to employ drama for the Qizarate. And he’d die for that.\n“You're being perverse,” Stilgar said. “Do you distrust me?”\nThe distress in his voice softened her expression, but not her tone. “You know | don’t distrust you. I’ve always agreed with my brother that once matters were in Stilgar’s hands we could safely forget them.”\n“Then why do you Say I’ve... changed?”\n“You're preparing to disobey my brother,” she said. “I can read it in you. | only hope it doesn’t destroy you both.”\nThe first of the Pleaders and Supplicants were approaching now. She turned away before Stilgar could respond. His face, though, was filled with the things she’d sensed in her mother’s letter—the replacement of morality and conscience with law.\n“You produce a deadly paradox.”\nTibana was an apologist for Socratic Christianity, probably a native of IV Anbus who lived between the eighth and ninth centuries before Corrino, likely in the second reign of Dalamak. Of his writings, only a portion survives from which this fragment is taken: “The hearts of all men dwell in the same wilderness.”\n—FROM THE DUNEBUK OF IRULAN\nee are Bijaz,” the ghola said, entering the small chamber where the dwarf was held under guard. “l am called Hayt.”\nA strong contingent of the household guard had come in with the ghola to take over the evening watch. Sand carried by the sunset wind had stung their cheeks while they crossed the outer yard, made them blink and hurry. They could be heard in the passage outside now exchanging the banter and ritual of their tasks.\n“You are not Hayt,” the dwarf said. “You are Duncan Idaho. | was there when they put your dead flesh into the tank and | was there when they removed it, alive and ready for training.”\nThe ghola swallowed in a throat suddenly dry. The bright glowglobes of the chamber lost their yellowness in the room’s green hangings. The light showed beads of perspiration on the dwarf’s forehead. Bijaz seemed a creature of odd integrity, as though the purpose fashioned into him by the Tleilaxu were projected out through his skin. There was power beneath the dwarf’s mask of cowardice and frivolity.\n“Muad’Dib has charged me to question you to determine what it is the Tleilaxu intend you to do here,” Hayt said.\n“Tleilaxu, Tleilaxu,” the dwarf sang. “I am the Tleilaxu, you dolt! For that matter, so are you.”\nHayt stared at the dwarf. Bijaz radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observer think of ancient idols.\n“You hear that guard outside?” Hayt asked. “If | gave them the order, they’d strangle you.”\n“Hai! Hai!” Bijaz cried. “What a callous lout you’ve become. And you said you came seeking truth.”\nHayt found he didn’t like the look of secret repose beneath the dwarf’s expression. “Perhaps | only seek the future,” he said.\n“Well spoken,” Bijaz said. “Now we know each other. When two thieves meet they need no introduction.”\n“So we're thieves,” Hayt said. “What do we steal?”\n“Not thieves, but dice,” Bijaz said. “And you came here to read my spots. I, in turn, read yours. And lo! You have two faces!”\n“Did you really see me go into the Tleilaxu tanks?” Hayt asked, fighting an odd reluctance to ask that question.\n“Did I not say it?” Bijaz demanded. The dwarf bounced to his feet. “We had a terrific struggle with you. The flesh did not want to come back.”\nHayt felt suddenly that he existed in a dream controlled by some other mind, and that he might momentarily forget this to become lost in the convolutions of that mind.\nBijaz tipped his head slyly to one side, walked all around the ghola, staring up at him. “Excitement kindles old patterns in you,” Bijaz said. “You are the pursuer who doesn’t want to find what he pursues.”\n“You're a weapon aimed at Muad’Dib,” Hayt said, swiveling to follow the dwarf. “What is it you’re to do?”\n“Nothing!” Bijaz said, stopping. “I give you a common answer to a common question.”\n“Then you were aimed at Alia,” Hayt said. “Is she your target?”\n“They call her Hawt, the Fish Monster, on the out-worlds, Bijaz said. “How is it | hear your blood boiling when you speak of her?”\n”\n“So they call her Hawt,” the ghola said, studying Bijaz for any clue to his purpose. The dwarf made such odd responses.\n“She is the virgin-harlot,” Bijaz said. “She is vulgar, witty, knowledgeable to a depth that terrifies, cruel when she is most kind, unthinking while she thinks, and when she seeks to build she is as destructive as a coriolis storm.”\n“So you came here to speak out against Alia,” Hayt said.\n“Against her?” Bijaz sank to a cushion against the wall. “1 came here to be captured by the magnetism of her physical beauty.” He grinned, a saurian expression in the big- featured face.\n“To attack Alia is to attack her brother,” Hayt said.\n“That is so clear it is difficult to see,” Bijaz said. “In truth, Emperor and sister are one person back to back, one being half male and half female.”\n“That is a thing we’ve heard said by the Fremen of the deep desert,” Hayt said. “And those are the ones who've revived the blood sacrifice to Shai-hulud. How is it you repeat their nonsense?”\n“You dare say nonsense?” Bijaz demanded. “You, who are both man and mask? Ahh, but the dice cannot read their own spots. | forget this. And you are doubly confused because you serve the Atreides double-being. Your senses are not as close to the answer as your mind is.”\n“Do you preach that false ritual about Muad’Dib to your guards?” Hayt asked, his voice low. He felt his mind being tangled by the dwarf’s words.\n“They preach to me!” Bijaz said. “And they pray. Why should they not? All of us should pray. Do we not live in the shadow of the most dangerous creation the universe has ever seen?”\n“Dangerous creation...”\n“Their own mother refuses to live on the same planet with them!”\n“Why don’t you answer me straight out?” Hayt demanded. “You know we have other ways of questioning you. We’ll get our answers... one way or another.”\n“But | have answered you! Have | not said the myth is real? Am | the wind that carries death in its belly? No! | am words! Such words as the lightning which strikes from the sand in a dark sky. | have said: ‘Blow out the lamp! Day is here!’ And you keep saying: ‘Give me a lamp so | can find the day.’”\n“You play a dangerous game with me,” Hayt said. “Did you think | could not understand these Zensunni ideas? You leave tracks as clear as those of a bird in mud.”\nBijaz began to giggle.\n“Why do you laugh?” Hayt demanded.\n“Because | have teeth and wish | had not,” Bijaz managed between giggles. “Having no teeth, | could not gnash them.”\n“And now | know your target,” Hayt said. “You were aimed at me.”\n“And I've hit it right on!” Bijaz said. “You made such a big target, how could | miss?” He nodded as though to himself. “Now I will sing to you.” He began to hum, a keening, whining monotonous theme, repeated over and over.\nHayt stiffened, experiencing odd pains that played up and down his spine. He stared at the face of the dwarf, seeing youthful eyes in an old face. The eyes were the center of a network of knobby white lines which ran to the hollows below his temples. Such a large head! Every feature focused on the pursed-up mouth from which that monotonous noise issued. The sound made Hayt think of ancient rituals, folk memories, old words and customs, half-forgotten meanings in lost mutterings. Something vital was happening here—a bloody play of ideas across Time. Elder ideas lay tangled in the dwarf’s singing. It was like a blazing light in the distance, coming nearer and nearer, illuminating life across a span of centuries.\n“What are you doing to me?” Hayt gasped.\n“You are the instrument | was taught to play,” Bijaz said. “I am playing you. Let me tell you the names of the other traitors among the Naibs. They are Bikouros and Cahueit. There is Djedida, who was secretary to Korba. There is Abumojandis, the aide to Bannerjee. Even now, one of them could be sinking a blade into your Muad’Dib.”\nHayt shook his head from side to side. He found it too difficult to talk.\n“We are like brothers,” Bijaz said, interrupting his monotonous hum once more. “We grew in the same tank: | first and then you.”\nHayt’s metal eyes inflicted him with a sudden burning pain. Flickering red haze surrounded everything he saw. He felt he had been cut away from every immediate sense except the pain, and he experienced his surroundings through a thin separation like windblown gauze. All had become accident, the chance involvement of inanimate matter. His own will was no more than a subtle, shifting thing. It lived without breath and was intelligible only as an inward illumination.\nWith a clarity born of desperation, he broke through the gauze curtain with the lonely sense of sight. His attention focused like a blazing light under Bijaz. Hayt felt that his eyes cut through layers of the dwarf, seeing the little man as a hired intellect, and beneath that, a creature imprisoned by hungers and cravings which lay huddled in the eyes— layer after layer, until finally, there was only an entity- aspect being manipulated by symbols.\n“We are upon a battleground,” Bijaz said. “You may speak of it.”\nHis voice freed by the command, Hayt said: “You cannot force me to slay Muad’Dib.”\n“I have heard the Bene Gesserit say,” Bijaz said, “that there is nothing firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a key figure who speaks for her brother and interacts with other characters like Stilgar and Tecrube.
