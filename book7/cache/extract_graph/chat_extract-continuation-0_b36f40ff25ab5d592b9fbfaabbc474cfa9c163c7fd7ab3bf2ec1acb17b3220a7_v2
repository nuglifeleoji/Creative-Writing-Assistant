重要的，就是让警方正确查出犯案时间。就结果来说，解剖或许能做出较正确的推定，但他最怕的就是尸体如果发现得晚，会拉长犯案时间的推定范围。弄得\n\n不好，万一拉长到前一天晚上――也就是九日晚上，对他们来说将会极为不利，因为那晚才是花冈母女杀害富坚的日子，她们没有不在场证明。为了预防这点，他希望至少能有脚\n\n踏车是在十日之后失窃的证据。于是重点就在那辆脚踏车了，必须是不太可能放上一整天的脚踏车，而是一旦被偷车主可能确定失窃日期的脚踏车，如此一来目标就指向新买的脚\n\n踏车。”\n    “原来那辆脚踏车还隐含了那么多钟意义。”草S用拳头往自己额上一敲。\n    “脚踏车被发现时，据说两个轮胎都被戳破了，对吧？这也是石神才会想到的顾虑，大概是为了防止被谁骑走。可以说他为了替花冈母女制造不在场证明，真处心积虑。”\n    “可是她们的不在场证明并没有那么明确。到现在都没找到决定性的证据，足以证明他们当时的确在电影院。”\n    “但是，你们也没找到不在电影院的证明吧？”汤川指着草S。“看似脆弱却又无法推翻的不在场证明，这才是石神设计的陷阱。如果准备的是无懈可击的不在场证明，那警\n\n方反而会怀疑中间可能动了什么手脚。在这个过程中，说不定会开始疑心死者不是富坚慎二，石神怕的就是这个。被杀的是富坚慎二，可疑的是花冈靖子，他故意制造出这种构图\n\n，好让警方无法排除这个刻板概念。”\n    草S沉吟。汤川说的没错。查明死者疑似富坚慎二后，他们立刻将怀疑的矛头指向花冈靖子。因为她坚持的不在场证明，令人半信半疑，警方一直怀疑她。但是怀疑她，也就\n\n等于深信死者就是富坚。\n    真是可怕的男人，草S低语。我也有同感，汤川说。\n    “我之所以察觉这个可怕的障眼法，还是你给我的灵感。”\n    “我？”\n    “你不是提过石神出数学考题时的论点吗？针对自以为是的盲点。看似几何问题，其实是函数问题，就是那个。”\n    “那个又怎么了？”\n    “同样的模式。看似不在场证明的障眼法，其实障眼法是设计在隐瞒死者身份的部分。”\n    草S不禁啊地叫出一声。\n    “后来，你记得你给我看过石神的出勤表吗？根据那个显示，他在三月十日上午，请假没去学校。你以为和命案无关，似乎没怎么重视，但我一看到那个就惊觉。石神想隐瞒\n\n的最重要一件事，就是那前一晚发生的。”\n    想隐瞒的最重要一件事――那就是花冈靖子杀死富\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
