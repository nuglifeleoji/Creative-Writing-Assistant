再能启齿吗？孙少平手里提着醋瓶，一个人静静地沿着铁路往回走。现在，他面对满山遍野的灯火，对这里的一切更加充满了无比亲切的感情。只要有人的地方，世界就不会是冰冷的。他不由再一次思想：我们活在人世间，最为珍视的应该是什么？金钱？权力？荣誉？是的，有这些东西也并不坏。但是，没有什么东西能比得上温暖的人情更为珍贵——你感受到的生活的真正美好，莫过于这一点了。 \n　　他回到宿舍，吞咽了那两个冷馒头。便带着复杂的思绪躺在了光床板上。 \n　　——第二天一大早，一声火车汽车笛的吼叫惊醒了他。 \n　　他立刻跳下床，匆忙地洗了一把脸，就从床底下取出那瓶山西老陈醋来。他象服毒药一般，闭住眼灌了几大口，酸得浑身象打摆子似地哆嗦了好一阵。他感到，胃里象倒进了一盆炭火，烧灼般地刺疼。 \n　　他一只手捂着胸口，满头大汗出了宿舍，弓着腰爬上一道土坡，穿过铁道，向矿医院走去。 \n　　他来到医院时，医生们还没有上班。他就蹲在砖墙边上，惴惴不安地等待着那个决定他命运的时刻。 \n　　心跳又加快了。为了平静一些，他强迫自己用一种悠闲的心情观察医院周围的环境。这院子是长方形的，有几棵泡桐和杨树。一个残破的小花坛，里面没有花，只栽着几棵低矮的冬青；冬青也没有修剪，长得披头散发。花坛旁有一棵也许是整个矿区唯一的垂柳，这婀娜身姿和煤矿的环境很不协调。在相距很远的两棵杨树之间，配着一根尼龙绳，上面晾晒着医院白色的床单和工作服。院子的背后是黄土山。院墙外的坡下是铁路，有一家私人照相馆。从低矮的砖墙上平视出去，东边是气势磅礴的矿区，西边就是干部家属楼——楼顶上立着桅林似的自制电视天线……八点钟，复查终于开始了。这次比较简单，身体哪科不行，就只查哪科。 \n　　和少平一块查血压的一共四个人。他排在最后一位。查验的有两位大夫，一位是男的，另一位就是那个女大夫。前面三个很快查完了。其中有一个血压还没有降下来，哭着走了——这是一位从中部平原农村来的青年。 \n　　现在，少平惊恐地坐在小凳上了。女大夫板着脸，没有一丝认识他的表示。她把连接血压计的橡皮带子箍在了他的光胳膊上。 \n　　他象忍受疼痛一般咬紧了牙关。
