He thought only about where he would next put a hand or a foot. He thought about the coil of light rope around his shoulders. That rope was the ta//ness of this Wall. He had measured it out on the ground, triangulating across the sand, not counting his steps. When the rope was long enough it was long enough. The Wall was as high as the rope was long. Any other way of thinking could only dull his mind.\nFeeling for handholds which he could not see, Idaho groped his way up the sheer face. . . well, not quite sheer. Wind and sand and even some rain, the forces of cold and heat, had been at their erosive work here for more than three thousand years. For one full day, Idaho had sat on the sand below the Wall and he had studied what had been accomplished by Time. He had fixed certain patterns in his mind—a slanting shadow, a thin line, a crumbling bulge, a tiny lip of rock here and another over there.\nHis fingers wriggled upward into a sharp crack. He tested his weight gently on the support. Yes. Briefly, he rested, pressing his face against warm rock, not looking up or down. He was simply here. Everything was a matter of the pacing. His shoulders must not be allowed to tire too soon. Weight must be adjusted between feet and arms. Fingers took inevitable damage, but while bone and tendons held, the Skin could be ignored.\nOnce more, he crept upward. A bit of rock broke away from his hand; dust and shards fell across his right cheek, but he did not even feel it. Every bit of his awareness concentrated on the groping hand, the balance of his feet on the tiniest of protrusions. He was a mote, a particle which defied gravity .. . a fingerhold here, a toehold there, clinging to the rock surface at times by the sheer power of his will.\nNine makeshift pitons bulged one of his pockets, but he resisted using them. The equally makeshift hammer dangled\nfrom his belt on a short cord whose knot his fingers had memorized.\nNayla had been difficult. She would not give up her lasgun. She had, however, obeyed Siona’s direct order to accompany them. A strange woman .. . strangely obedient.\n“Have you not sworn to obey me?” Siona had demanded.\nNayla’s reluctance had vanished.\nLater, Siona had said: “She always obeys my direct orders.”\n“Then we may not have to kill her,” Idaho had said.\n“I would rather not attempt it. | don’t think you have even the faintest idea of her strength and quickness.”\nGarun, the Museum Fremen who dreamed of becoming a “true Naib in the old fashion,” had set the stage for this climb by answering Idaho’s question: “How will the God Emperor come to Tuono?”\n“In the same way he chose for a visit during my great- grandfather’s time.”\n“And that was?” Siona had prompted him.\nThey had been sitting in the dusty shadows outside the guest house, sheltering from the afternoon sun on the day of the announcement that the Lord Leto would be wed in Tuono. A semicircle of Garun’s aides squatted around the doorstep where Siona and Idaho sat with Garun. Two Fish Speakers lounged nearby, listening. Nayla was due to arrive momentarily.\nGarun pointed to the high Wall behind the village, its rim glistening distant gold in the sunlight. “The Royal Road runs there and the God Emperor has a device which lowers him gently from the heights.”\n“It’s built into his cart,” Idaho said.\n“Suspensors,” Siona agreed. “I’ve seen them.”\n“My great-grandfather said they came along the Royal Road, a great troop of them. The God Emperor glided down to our village square on his device. The others came down on ropes.”\nIdaho spoke thoughtfully: “Ropes.”\n“Why did they come?” Siona asked.\n“To affirm that the God Emperor had not forgotten his Fremen, so my great-grandfather said. It was a great honor, but not as great as this wedding.”\nIdaho arose while Garun was still talking. There was a clear view of the high Wall from nearby—straight down the central street, a view from the base in the sand to the top in the sunlight. Idaho strode to the corner of the guest house out into the central street. He stopped there, turned and looked at the Wall. The first look told why everyone said it was not possible to climb that face. Even then, he resisted thinking about a measurement of the height. It could be five hundred meters or five thousand. The important thing lay in what a more careful study revealed—tiny transverse cracks, broken places, even a narrow ledge about twenty meters above the drifting sand at the bottom... and another ledge about two-thirds of the way up the face.\nHe knew that an unconscious part of him, an ancient and dependable part, was making the necessary measurements, scaling them to his own body—so many Duncan-lengths to that place, a handgrip here, another there. His own hands. He could already feel himself climbing.\nSiona’s voice came from near his right shoulder as he stood in that first examination. “What’re you doing?” She had come up soundlessly, looking now where he looked.\n“I can climb that Wall,” Idaho said. “If | carried a light rope, | could pull up a heavier rope. The rest of you could climb it easily then.”\nGarun joined them in time to hear this. “Why would you climb the Wall, Duncan Idaho?”\nSiona answered for him, smiling at Garun. “To provide a Suitable greeting for the God Emperor.”\nThis had been before her doubts, before her own eyes and the ignorance of such a climb, had begun to erode that first confidence.\nWith that first elation, Idaho asked: “How wide is the Royal Road up there?”\n“| have never seen it,” Garun said. “But | am told it is very wide. A great troop can march abreast along it, so they say. And there are bridges, places to view the river and... and... oh, itis a marvel.”\n“Why have you never gone up there to see it yourself?” Idaho asked.\nGarun merely shrugged and pointed at the Wall.\nNayla arrived then and the argument about the climb had begun. Idaho thought about that argument as he climbed. How strange, the relationship between Nayla and Siona! They were like two conspirators ... yet not conspirators. Siona commanded and Nayla obeyed. But Nayla was a Fish Speaker, the Friend who was trusted by Leto to make a first examination of the new ghola. She admitted that she had been in the Royal Constabulary since childhood. Such strength in her! Given that strength, there was something awesome about the way she bowed to Siona’s will. It was as though Nayla listened for secret voices which told her what to do. Then she obeyed.\nIdaho groped upward for another handhold. His fingers wriggled along the rock, up and outward to the right, finding at last an unseen crack where they might enter. His memory provided the natural line of ascent, but only his body could learn the way by following that line. His left foot found a toehold...up...up... slowly, testing. Left hand up now ...no crack but a ledge. His eyes, then his chin lifted over the high ledge he had seen from below. He elbowed his way onto it, rolled over and rested, looking only outward, not up or down. It was a sand horizon out there, a breeze with dust in it limiting the view. He had seen many such horizons in the Dune days.\nPresently, he turned to face the Wall, lifted himself onto his knees, hands groping upward, and he resumed the climb. The picture of the Wall remained in his mind as he\nhad seen it from below. He had only to close his eyes and the pattern lay there, fixed the way he had learned to do it as a child hiding from Harkonnen slave raiders. Fingertips found a crack where they could be wedged. He clawed his way upward.\nWatching from below, Nayla experienced a growing affinity for the climber. Idaho had been reduced by distance to such a small and lonely shape upon the Wall. He must know what it was like to be alone with momentous decisions.\n| would like to have his child, she thought. A child from both of us would be strong and resourceful. What is it that God wants from a child of Siona and this man?\nNayla had awakened before dawn and had walked out to the top of a low dune at the village edge to think about this thing that Idaho proposed. It had been a lime dawn with a familiar winding cloth of dust in the distance, then steel day and the baleful immensity of the Sareer. She knew then that these matters certainly had been anticipated by God. What could be hidden from God? Nothing could be hidden, not even the remote figure of Duncan Idaho groping for a pathway up to the edge of heaven.\nAs she watched Idaho climb, Nayla’s mind played a trick on her, tipping the wall to the horizontal. Idaho became a child crawling across a broken surface. How small he looked ... and growing smaller.\nAn aide offered Nayla water which she drank. The water brought the Wall back into its true perspective.\nSiona crouched on the first ledge, leaning out to peer upward. “If you fall, | will try it,” Siona had promised Idaho. Nayla had thought it a strange promise. Why would both of them want to try the impossible?\nIdaho had failed to dissuade Siona from the impossible promise.\nIt is fate, Nayla thought. /t is God’s will.\nThey were the same thing.\nA bit of rock fell from where Idaho clutched at it. That had happened several times. Nayla watched the falling rock. It took a long time coming down, bounding and rebounding from the Wall’s face, demonstrating that the eye did not report truthfully when it said the Wall was sheer.\nHe will succeed or he will not, Nayla thought. Whatever happens, it is God’s will.\nShe could feel her heart hammering, though. Idaho’s venture was like sex, she thought. It was not passively erotic, but akin to rare magic in the way it seized her. She had to keep reminding herself that Idaho was not for her.\nHe is for Siona. If he survives.\nAnd if he failed, then Siona would try. Siona would succeed or she would not. Nayla wondered, though, if she might experience an orgasm should Idaho reach the top. He was so close to it now.\nIdaho took several deep breaths after dislodging the rock. It was a bad moment and he took the time to recover, clinging to a three-point hold on the Wall. Almost of its own accord, his free hand groped upward once more, wriggling past the rotten place into another slender crack. Slowly, he shifted his weight onto that hand. Slowly . . . slowly. His left knee felt the place where a toehold could be achieved. He lifted his foot to that place, tested it. Memory told him the top was near, but he pushed the memory aside. There was only the climb and the knowledge that Leto would arrive tomorrow.\nLeto and Hwi.\nHe could not think about that, either. But it would not go away. The top...Hwi...Leto...tomorrow...\nEvery thought fed his desperation, forced him into the immediate remembrance of the climbs of his childhood. The more he remembered consciously,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_dc60a520b9d09d26137c62a4a35494ae9887b8377ff9942bb1592f7a85ed6ff1_v2"}
