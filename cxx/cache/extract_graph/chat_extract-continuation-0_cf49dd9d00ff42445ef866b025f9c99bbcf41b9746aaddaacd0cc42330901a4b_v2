��量不均匀而产生的全球大风已传到了这里，狂风在北京的高层建筑间呼啸；随风带来的被电离的空气在高空中发出震耳欲聋的霹雳，闪电不时把城市照得一片雪亮；大团大团的黑云从东面扑过来，象巨人的乱发，飞过中天后就太阳烧成火红，在闪电的间隙，可以看到半边天空在燃烧……\n　　华华和小梦呆呆地看着眼前的一片黑暗，他们仿佛处于四面都是无际空间的太空之中，他们觉得自己看到了群星和银河。同一时刻，这个行星上所有活着的人都像他们一样呆呆地看着这个无法理解的宇宙，同时面对着一个令人难以置信的事实：\n　　百分之七十五的人将死去，他们都是11岁以上的人。\n　　地球，将成为一个只有孩子的星球！！\n　　\n　　五、面对死亡\n\n　　最先公布灾情报告的是美国。在这之前，各国政府和世界卫生组织都得出了确切无疑的调查数据（在大多数国家，死星刚刚熄灭，灾情调查就已开始），医疗和通讯技术较为先进的西方国家最先得知全部灾情，但都压住不敢发布。这时从各种渠道传出的消息已渗透到世界的各个角落，这主要来自各医疗机构单独进行的诊断。人们普遍听说了75%的患病率，但对于患病者的年龄界限却知道的很少，或者是知道了不相信，真实的结果确实是太出乎人们意料了。在短短的几个小时之内，骚乱象野火一样在世界各地蔓延，最严重的是西欧和北美地区.\n　　最初的骚乱只是集中在医疗机构周围，那时一般人还没想到SLER病，都以为威胁他们生命的是白血病。一时间，象环磷酰胺，氨甲喋呤，阿霉素和强的松这类药物变得比黄金还珍贵。后来，骚乱向更大面积上发展，越来越多的人失去理智，最后演化成为集体的疯狂，即使神经最坚强的人也不能幸免。政府渐渐无力控制局势，赖以维持秩序的警方和军队本身也处于极不稳定的状态中，甚至政府本身，由于已得知确切灾情，都处于半麻木状态，全人类在经受着文明史上最大的精神压力。巴黎埃菲尔铁塔和纽约的摩天大楼森林下面，成千上万辆小汽车撞成一堆，有的已开始燃烧；欧美的各大机场都因混乱而关闭，美洲和欧洲大陆的空中和地面交通全部瘫痪。在第一个灾情报告发布前，世界各大城市的混乱已到极点，爆炸声和枪声此起彼伏，失火的高层建筑向空中腾起高高的烟柱，到处都是疯狂的人群……面对失控的局势，美国第44任总统不得不下令公布灾情。\n　　灾情公告在美国发布以后，电波传遍了世界\n######################\nOutput:",
