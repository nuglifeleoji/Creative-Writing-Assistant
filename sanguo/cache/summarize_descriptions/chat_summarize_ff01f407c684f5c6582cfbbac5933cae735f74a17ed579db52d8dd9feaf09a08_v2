He is best known for his leadership during the Battle of Red Cliffs, where he successfully allied with Liu Bei to defeat the numerically superior forces of Cao Cao.\n\n吕蒙, serving under 周瑜, was a capable general in his own right. His military relationship with 周瑜 highlights the collaborative nature of their efforts in warfare. 周瑜 recognized 吕蒙's talents and assigned him to support 甘宁, another notable general, in various military operations. This assignment underscores the trust and strategic planning that 周瑜 employed in his command, as he delegated responsibilities to his capable subordinates to enhance their military effectiveness.\n\nTogether, 周瑜 and 吕蒙 contributed significantly to the military successes of Eastern Wu, with 吕蒙's support being instrumental in executing the strategies devised by 周瑜.
