He is primarily recognized for his involvement in various military operations and conflicts, showcasing his strategic capabilities and leadership skills. Initially, Zhang Yi served under Yuan Shao, a prominent warlord, where he participated in the conflict against Cao Cao, another significant figure of the era. His tenure under Yuan Shao highlights his early military engagements and the allegiances that shaped his career.\n\nAs the political landscape shifted, Zhang Yi later defected to Cao Cao's side, indicating a strategic pivot in his loyalties that was not uncommon during this tumultuous period. This move allowed him to continue his military career under a different banner, further emphasizing his adaptability and the complexities of allegiances during the Three Kingdoms era.\n\nIn addition to his service under Yuan Shao and Cao Cao, Zhang Yi also played a crucial role in the Shu army, where he engaged in battles against Wei, another major power of the time. His involvement in these military operations against Wei demonstrates his commitment to the Shu cause and his active participation in the broader conflicts that characterized the era.\n\nZhang Yi is also noted for his bravery and leadership, particularly during his service under Kong Ming, also known as Zhuge Liang, who was a renowned strategist and chancellor of Shu. This association with Kong Ming further solidifies Zhang Yi's reputation as a capable and respected general within the Shu military hierarchy.\n\nDespite the various roles he played, there is some ambiguity regarding his position as a guard in the central army, which may reflect a different phase of his career or a specific assignment that complemented his generalship. Overall, Zhang Yi's military career is marked by significant engagements against formidable opponents, strategic shifts in allegiance, and a legacy of bravery and leadership that contributed to the historical narratives of the Three Kingdoms period.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754984066, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 634, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
