Always more galaxies. Tam’s right. It’s daunting when you focus on that Golden Path.\nMemories of explorations gave the Sisterhood a statistical handle on it but little else. So many habitable planets ina given assemblage and, among those, an expected additional number that could be terraformed.\n“What’s evolving out there?” Tamalane demanded.\nA question they could not answer. Ask what Infinity might produce and the only answer possible was, “Anything.”\nAny good, any evil; any god, any devil.\n“What if Honored Matres are fleeing something?” Odrade asked. “Interesting possibility?”\n“These speculations are useless,” Bellonda muttered. “We don’t even know if Foldspace introduces us to one universe ormany...or even an infinite number of expanding and collapsing bubbles.”\n“Did the Tyrant understand this any better than we do?” Tamalane asked.\nThey paused while Odrade looked into a room where five Advanced acolytes and a Proctor studied a projection of regional melange stores. The crystal holding the information performed an intricate dance in the projector, bouncing on its beam like a ball on a fountain. Odrade saw the summation and turned away before scowling. Tam and Bell did not see Odrade’s expression. We will have to start limiting access to melange data. Too depressing to morale.\nAdministration! It all came back to Mother Superior. Delegate heavily to only the same people and you fell into bureaucracy.\nOdrade knew she depended too much on her inner sense of administration. A system frequently tested and revised, using automation only where essential. “The machinery” they called it. By the time they became Reverend Mothers, all of them had some sensitivity to “the machinery” and tended to use it without question thereafter. There lay the danger. Odrade pressed for constant improvements (even tiny ones) to introduce change into their activities. Randomness! No absolute patterns that others could find and use against them. One person might not see such shifts in a lifetime but differences over longer periods were sure to be measurable.\nOdrade’s party came down to ground level and onto the major thoroughfare of Central. “The Way,” Sisters called it. An in-joke, referring to the training regimen popularly known as “The Bene Gesserit Way.”\nThe Way reached from the square beside Odrade’s tower to the southern outskirts of the urban area—straight as a lasgun beam, almost twelve klicks of tall buildings and low\nones. The low ones all had something in common: they had been built strong enough to expand upward.\nOdrade flagged an open transporter with empty seats and the three of them crowded into a space where they could continue to talk. Frontage on The Way carried an old- fashioned appeal, Odrade thought. Buildings such as these with their tall rectangular windows of insulating plaz had framed Bene Gesserit “Ways” through much of the Sisterhood’s history. Down the center ran a line of elms genetically tailored for height and narrow profile. Birds nested in them and the morning was bright with flitting spots of red and orange—orioles, tanagers.\nIs it dangerously patterned for us to prefer this familiar setting?\nOdrade led them off the transporter at Tipsy Trail, thinking how Bene Gesserit humor came out in curious names. Waggish in the streets. Tipsy Trail because the foundation of one building had subsided slightly, giving that structure a curiously drunken appearance. The one member of the group stepping out of line.\nLike Mother Superior. Only they don’t know it yet.\nHer Ear-C buzzed as they came to Tower Lane. “Mother Superior?” It was Streggi. Without stopping, Odrade signaled that she was on-line. “You asked for a report on Murbella. Suk Central says she is fit for assigned classes.”\n“Then assign her.” They continued down Tower Lane: all one-story buildings.\nOdrade spared a brief glance for the low buildings on both sides of the street. A two-story addition was being made to one of them. Might be a real Tower Lane here someday and the joke (such as it was) abandoned.\nIt was argued that naming was just a convenience anyway and they might as well enjoy this venture into what was a delicate subject for the Sisterhood.\nOdrade stopped abruptly on a busy walkway and turned to her companions. “What would you say if | suggested we\nname streets and places after departed Sisters?”\n“You're full of nonsense today!” Bellonda accused.\n“They are not departed,” Tamalane said.\nOdrade resumed her prowling walk. She had expected that. Bell’s thoughts could almost be heard. We carry the “departed” around in Other Memory!\nOdrade wanted no argument here in the open but she thought her idea had merit. Some Sisters died without Sharing. Major Memory Lines were duplicated but you lost a thread and its terminated carrier. Schwangyu of the Gammu Keep had gone that way, killed by attacking Honored Matres. Plenty of memories remained to carry her good qualities .. . and complexities. One hesitated to say her mistakes taught more than her successes.\nBellonda increased her pace to walk beside Odrade ina relatively empty stretch. “I must speak of Idaho. A Mentat, yes, but those multiple memories. Supremely dangerous!”\nThey were passing a morgue, the strong smell of antiseptics even in the street. The arched doorway stood open.\n“Who died?” Odrade asked, ignoring Bellonda’s anxiety.\n“A Proctor from Section Four and an orchard maintenance man,” Tamalane said. Tam always knew.\nBellonda was furious at being ignored and made no attempt to hide it. “Will you two stick to the point?”\n“What is the point?” Odrade asked. Very mild.\nThey emerged on the south terrace and stopped at the stone rail to look over the plantations—vineyards and orchards. The morning light had a dusty haze in it not at all like the mists created of moisture.\n“You know the point!” Bell would not be deflected.\nOdrade stared at the vista, pressing herself against the stones. The railing was frigid. That mist out there was a different color, she thought. Sunlight came through dust with a different reflective spectrum. More bounce and sharpness to the light. Absorbed in a different way. The\nnimbus was tighter. The blowing dust and sand crept into every crevice the way water did but the grating and rasping betrayed its source. The same with Bell’s persistence. No lubrication.\n“That’s desert light,” Odrade said, pointing.\n“Stop avoiding me,” Bellonda said.\nOdrade chose not to answer. The dusty light was a classical thing, but not reassuring in the way of the elder painters and their misty mornings.\nTamalane came up beside Odrade. “Beautiful in its own way.” The remote tone said she made Other Memory comparisons similar to Odrade’s.\nIf that’s how you were conditioned to look for beauty. But something deep within Odrade said this was not the beauty for which she longed.\nIn the shallow swales below them, where once there had been greenery, now there was dryness and a sense of the earth being gutted the way ancient Egyptians had prepared their dead—dried to essential matter, preserved for their Eternity. Desert as deathmaster, swaddling the dirt in nitron, embalming our beautiful planet with all of its jewels concealed.\nBellonda stood behind them, muttering and shaking her head, refusing to look at what their planet would become.\nOdrade almost shuddered in a sudden thrust of simulflow. Memory flooded her: She felt herself searching Sietch Tabr’s ruins, finding desert-embalmed bodies of spice pirates left where killers had dropped them.\nWhat is Sietch Tabr now? A molten flow solidified and without anything to mark its proud history. Honored Matres: killers of history.\n“If you won’t eliminate Idaho, then | must protest your using him as a Mentat.”\nBell was such a fussy woman! Odrade noted that she was showing her age more than ever. Reading lenses on her nose even now. They magnified her eyes until she had the\nlook of a great-orbed fish. Use of lenses and not one of the more subtle prostheses said something about her. She flaunted a reverse vanity that announced: “I am greater than the devices my failing senses require.”\nBellonda was definitely irritated by Mother Superior. “Why are you staring at me that way?”\nOdrade, caught by abrupt awareness of a weakness in her Council, shifted her attention to Tamalane. Cartilage never stopped growing and this had enlarged Tam’s ears, nose and chin. Some Reverend Mothers adjusted this by metabolism control or sought regular surgical correction. Tam would not bow to such vanity. “Here’s what | am. Take it or leave it.”\nMy advisors are too old. And I... I should be younger and stronger to have these problems on my shoulders. Oh, damn this for a lapse into self-pity!\nOnly one supreme danger: action against survival of the Sisterhood.\n“Duncan is a superb Mentat!” Odrade spoke with all the force of her position. “But | use none of you beyond your Capabilities.”\nBellonda remained silent. She knew a Mentat’s weaknesses.\nMentats! Odrade thought. They were like walking Archives but when you most needed answers they relapsed into questions.\n“| don’t need another Mentat,” Odrade said. “I need an inventor!”\nWhen Bellonda still did not speak, Odrade said: “I am freeing his mind, not his body.”\n“| insist on an analysis before you open all data sources to him!”\nConsidering Bellonda’s usual stance, that was mild. But Odrade did not trust it. She detested those sessions— endless rehashing of Archival reports. Bellonda doted on them. Bellonda of Archival minutiae and boring excursions\ninto irrelevant details! Who cared if Reverend Mother X preferred skimmed milk on her porridge?\nOdrade turned her back on Bellonda and looked at the southern sky. Dust! We would sift more dust! Bellonda would be flanked by assistants. Odrade felt boredom just imagining it.\n“No more analysis.” Odrade spoke more sharply than she had intended.\n“I do have a point of view.” Bellonda sounded hurt.\nPoint of view? Are we no more than sensory windows on our universe, each with only a point of view?\nInstincts and memories of all types .. . even Archives— none of these things spoke for themselves except by compelling intrusions. None carried weight until formulated in a living consciousness. But whoever produced the formulation tipped the scales. A// order is arbitrary! Why this datum rather than some other? Any Reverend Mother knew events occurred in their own flux, their own relative environment. Why couldn’t a Mentat Reverend Mother act from that knowledge?\n“Do you refuse counsel?” That was Tamalane. Was she siding with Bell?\n“When have | ever refused counsel?” Odrade let her outrage show. “I am refusing another of Bell’s Archival merry-go-rounds.”\nBellonda intruded. “Then, in reality—”\n“Bell! Don’t talk to me about reality!” Let her simmer in that! Reverend Mother and Mentat! There is no reality. Only our own order imposed on everything. A basic Bene Gesserit dictum.\nThere were times (and this was one of them) when Odrade wished she had been born in an earlier era—a Roman matron in the long pax of the aristocrats, or a much- pampered Victorian. But she was trapped by time and circumstances.\nTrapped forever?\nMust face that possibility.
