Let us suppose further that the commander and his men died before conveying this information to your father—who couldn’t have made much use of it anyway. There would remain then a physical fact, a bit of flesh which had been sent off to the Tleilaxu. There was only one way for it to be sent, of course, ona heighliner. We of the Guild naturally know every cargo we transport. Learning of this one, would we not think it additional wisdom to purchase the ghola as a gift befitting an Emperor?”\n“You've done it then,” Irulan said.\nScytale, who had resumed his roly-poly first appearance, said: “As our long-winded friend indicates, we’ve done it.”\n“How has Idaho been conditioned?” Irulan asked.\n“Idaho?” Edric asked, looking at the Tleilaxu. “Do you know of an Idaho, Scytale?”\n“We sold you a creature called Hayt,” Scytale said.\n“Ah, yes—Hayt,” Edric said. “Why did you sell him to us?”\n“Because we once bred a kwisatz haderach of our own,” Scytale said.\nWith a quick movement of her old head, the Reverend Mother looked up at him. “You didn’t tell us that!” she accused.\n“You didn’t ask,” Scytale said.\n“How did you overcome your kwisatz haderach?” Irulan asked.\n“A creature who has spent his life creating one particular representation of his selfdom will die rather than become the antithesis of that representation,” Scytale said.\n“| do not understand,” Edric ventured.\n“He killed himself,” the Reverend Mother growled.\n“Follow me well, Reverend Mother,” Scytale warned, using a voice mode which said: You are not a sex object, have never been a sex object, cannot be a sex object.\nThe Tleilaxu waited for the blatant emphasis to sink in. She must not mistake his intent. Realization must pass through anger into awareness that the Tleilaxu certainly could not make such an accusation, knowing as he must the breeding requirements of the Sisterhood. His words, though, contained a gutter insult, completely out of character for a Tleilaxu.\nSwiftly, using the mirabhasa placative mode, Edric tried to smooth over the moment. “Scytale, you told us you sold Hayt because you shared our desire on how to use him.”\n“Edric, you will remain silent until | give you permission to speak,” Scytale said. And as the Guildsman started to protest, the Reverend Mother snapped: “Shut up, Edric!”\nThe Guildsman drew back into his tank in flailing agitation.\n“Our own transient emotions aren’t pertinent to a solution of the mutual problem,” Scytale said. “They cloud reasoning because the only relevant emotion is the basic fear which brought us to this meeting.”\n“We understand,” Irulan said, glancing at the Reverend Mother.\n“You must see the dangerous limitations of our shield,” Scytale said. “The oracle cannot chance upon what it cannot understand.”\n“You are devious, Scytale,” Irulan said.\nHow devious she must not guess, Scytale thought. When this is done, we will possess a kwisatz haderach we can control. These others will possess nothing.\n“What was the origin of your kwisatz haderach?” the Reverend Mother asked.\n“We've dabbled in various pure essences,” Scytale said. “Pure good and pure evil. A pure villain who delights only in creating pain and terror can be quite educational.”\n“The old Baron Harkonnen, our Emperor’s grandfather, was he a Tleilaxu creation?” Irulan asked.\n“Not one of ours,” Scytale said. “But then nature often produces creations as deadly as ours. We merely produce them under conditions where we can study them.”\n“I will not be passed by and treated this way!” Edric protested. “Who is it hides this meeting from—”\n“You see?” Scytale asked. “Whose best judgment conceals us? What judgment?”\n“I wish to discuss our mode of giving Hayt to the Emperor,” Edric insisted. “It’s my understanding that Hayt reflects the old morality that the Atreides learned on his birthworld. Hayt is supposed to make it easy for the Emperor to enlarge his moral nature, to delineate the positive-negative elements of life and religion.”\nScytale smiled, passing a benign gaze over his companions. They were as he’d been led to expect. The old Reverend Mother wielded her emotions like a scythe. Irulan had been well trained for a task at which she had failed, a flawed Bene Gesserit creation. Edric was no more (and no less) than the magician’s hand: he might conceal and distract. For now, Edric relapsed into sullen silence as the others ignored him.\n“Do | understand that this Hayt is intended to poison Paul’s psyche?” Irulan asked.\n“More or less,” Scytale said.\n“And what of the Qizarate?” Irulan asked.\n“It requires only the slightest shift in emphasis, a glissade of the emotions, to transform envy into enmity,” Scytale said.\n“And CHOAM?” Irulan asked.\n“They will rally round profit,” Scytale said.\n“What of the other power groups?”\n“One invokes the name of government,” Scytale said. “We will annex the less powerful in the name of morality and progress. Our opposition will die of its own entanglements.”\n“Alia, too?”\n“Hayt is a multi-purpose ghola,” Scytale said. “The Emperor’s sister is of an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose. She will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat.”\nMohiam allowed her old eyes to go wide in surprise. “The ghola’s a mentat? That’s a dangerous move.”\n“To be accurate,” Irulan said, “a mentat must have accurate data. What if Paul asks him to define the purpose behind our gift?”\n“Hayt will tell the truth,” Scytale said. “It makes no difference.”\n“So you leave an escape door open for Paul,” Irulan said.\n“A mentat!” Mohiam muttered.\nScytale glanced at the old Reverend Mother, seeing the ancient hates which colored her responses. From the days of the Butlerian Jihad when “thinking machines” had been wiped from most of the universe, computers had inspired distrust. Old emotions colored the human computer as well.\n“I do not like the way you smile,” Mohiam said abruptly, speaking in the truth mode as she glared up at Scytale.\nIn the same mode, Scytale said: “And I think less of what pleases you. But we must work together. We all see that.” He glanced at the Guildsman. “Don’t we, Edric?”\n“You teach painful lessons,” Edric said. “| presume you wished to make it plain that | must not assert myself against the combined judgments of my fellow conspirators.”\n“You see, he can be taught,” Scytale said.\n“I see other things as well,” Edric growled. “The Atreides holds a monopoly on the spice. Without it | cannot probe the future. The Bene Gesserit lose their truthsense. We have stockpiles, but these are finite. Melange is a powerful coin.”\n“Our civilization has more than one coin,” Scytale said. “Thus, the law of supply and demand fails.”\n“You think to steal the secret of it,” Mohiam wheezed. “And him with a planet guarded by his mad Fremen!”\n“The Fremen are civil, educated and ignorant,” Scytale said. “They’re not mad. They’re trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.”\n“But will | be left with something to father a royal dynasty?” Irulan asked.\nThey all heard the commitment in her voice, but only Edric smiled at it.\n“Something,” Scytale said. “Something.”\n“It means the end of this Atreides as a ruling force,” Edric said.\n“I should imagine that others less gifted as oracles have made that prediction,” Scytale said. “For them, mektub al mellah, as the Fremen Say.”\n“The thing was written with salt,” Irulan translated.\nAs she spoke, Scytale recognized what the Bene Gesserit had arrayed here for him—a beautiful and intelligent female who could never be his. Ah, well, he thought, perhaps l'II copy her for another.\nEvery civilization must contend with an unconscious force which can block, betray or countermand almost any conscious intention of the collectivity.\n—TLEILAXU THEOREM (UNPROVEN)\naul sat on the edge of his bed and began stripping off his\ndesert boots. They smelled rancid from the lubricant which eased the action of the heel-powered pumps that drove his stillsuit. It was late. He had prolonged his nighttime walk and caused worry for those who loved him. Admittedly, the walks were dangerous, but it was a kind of danger he could recognize and meet immediately. Something compelling and attractive surrounded walking anonymously at night in the streets of Arrakeen.\nHe tossed the boots into the corner beneath the room’s lone glowglobe, attacked the seal strips of his stillsuit. Gods below, how tired he was! The tiredness stopped at his muscles, though, and left his mind seething. Watching the mundane activities of everyday life filled him with profound envy. Most of that nameless flowing life outside the walls of his Keep couldn’t be shared by an Emperor—but . . . to walk down a public street without attracting attention: what a privilege! To pass by the clamoring of mendicant pilgrims, to hear a Fremen curse a shopkeeper: “You have damp hands!” ...\nPaul smiled at the memory, slipped out of his stillsuit.\nHe stood naked and oddly attuned to his world. Dune was a world of paradox now—a world under siege, yet the center of power. To come under siege, he decided, was the inevitable fate of power. He stared down at the green Carpeting, feeling its rough texture against his soles.\nThe streets had been ankle deep in sand blown over the Shield Wall on the stratus wind. Foot traffic had churned it\ninto choking dust which clogged stillsuit filters. He could smell the dust even now despite a blower cleaning at the portals of his Keep. It was an odor full of desert memories.\nOther days... other dangers.\nCompared to those other days, the peril in his lonely walks remained minor. But, putting on a stillsuit, he put on the desert. The suit with all its apparatus for reclaiming his body’s moisture guided his thoughts in subtle ways, fixed his movements in a desert pattern. He became wild Fremen. More than a disguise, the suit made of him a stranger to his city self. In the stillsuit, he abandoned security and put on the old skills of violence. Pilgrims and townfolk passed him then with eyes downcast.
