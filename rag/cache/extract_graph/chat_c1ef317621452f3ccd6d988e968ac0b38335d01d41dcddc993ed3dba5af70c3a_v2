Beyond the ring of orchards and gardens lay a careful checkerboard of private residences, each with its surrounding plantation. Retired Sisters and selected loyal families occupied these privileged estates. Sawtoothed mountains, their tops often brilliant with snow, drew the western limits. The spacefield lay twenty kilometers eastward. All around this core of Chapter House were open plains where grazed a peculiar breed of cattle, a cattle so susceptible to alien odors they would stampede in raucous bellowing at the slightest intrusion of people not marked by the local smell. The innermost homes with their pain-fenced plantings had been sited by an early Bashar in such a way that no one could move through the twisting ground-level channels day or night without being observed.\nIt all appeared so haphazard and casual, yet there was harsh order in it. And that, Taraza knew, personified the Sisterhood.\nThe clearing of a throat behind her reminded Taraza that one of those who had argued most vehemently in Council remained waiting patiently in the open doorway.\nWaiting for my decision.\nThe Reverend Mother Bellonda wanted Odrade “killed out of hand.” No decision had been reached.\nYou’ve really done it this time, Dar. | expected your wild independence. | even wanted it. But this!\nBellonda, old, fat and florid, cold-eyed and valued for her natural viciousness, wanted Odrade condemned as a traitor.\n“The Tyrant would have crushed her immediately!” Bellonda argued.\nIs that all we learned from him? Taraza wondered.\nBellonda argued that Odrade was not only an Atreides but also a Corrino. There were emperors and vice-regents and powerful administrators to a very large number in her ancestry.\nWith all of the power hunger this implies.\n“Her ancestors survived Salusa Secundus!” Bellonda kept repeating. “Have we learned nothing from our breeding experiences?”\nWe learned how to create Odrades, Taraza thought.\nAfter surviving the spice agony, Odrade had been sent to Al Dhanab, an equivalent of Salusa Secundus, there to be conditioned deliberately on a planet of constant testing: high cliffs and dry gorges, hot winds and frigid winds, little moisture and too much. It was judged a suitable proving ground for someone whose destiny might take her to Rakis. Tough survivors emerged from such conditioning. The tall, supple, and muscular Odrade was one of the toughest.\nHow can I salvage this situation?\nOdrade’s most recent message said that any peace, even the Tyrant’s millennia of Suppression, radiated a false aura that could be fatal to those who trusted it too much. That was both the strength and flaw in Bellonda’s argument.\nTaraza lifted her gaze to Bellonda waiting in the doorway. She is too fat! She flaunts that before us!\n“We can no more eliminate Odrade than we can eliminate the ghola,” Taraza said.\nBellonda’s voice came low and level: “Both are now too dangerous to us. Look how Odrade weakens you with her account of those words at Sietch Tabr!”\n“Has the Tyrant’s message weakened me, Bell?”\n“You know what | mean. The Bene Tleilax have no morals.”\n“Quit changing the subject, Bell. Your thoughts are darting around like an insect among the blossoms. What is it you really smell here?”\n“The Tleilaxu! They made that ghola for their own purposes. And now Odrade wants us to—”\n“You're repeating yourself, Bell.”\n“The Tleilaxu take shortcuts. Their view of genetics is not our view. It is not a human view. They make monsters.”\n“Is that what they do?”\nBellonda came into the room, walked around the table and stood close to Taraza, blocking the Mother Superior’s view of the niche and its statuette of Chenoeh.\n“Alliance with the priests of Rakis, yes, but not with the Tleilaxu.” Bellonda’s robes rustled as she gestured with a clenched fist.\n“Bell! The High Priest is now a mimic Face Dancer. Ally with him, you mean?”\nBellonda shook her head angrily. “Believers in Shai-hulud are legion! You find them everywhere. What will be their reaction to us if our part in the deception is ever exposed?”\n“No you don’t, Bell! We have seen to it that only the Tleilaxu are vulnerable there. In that, Odrade’s right.”\n“Wrong! If we ally with them we are both vulnerable. We will be forced to serve the Tleilaxu design. It will be worse than our long subservience to the Tyrant.”\nTaraza saw the vicious glinting of Bellonda’s eyes. Her reaction was understandable. No Reverend Mother could contemplate the special bondage they had endured under the God Emperor without at least some chilling remembrances. Whipped along against their will, never sure of Bene Gesserit survival from one day to the next.\n“You think we assure our spice supply by such a stupid alliance?” Bellonda demanded.\nIt was the same old argument, Taraza saw. Without melange and the agony of its transformation, there could be no Reverend Mothers. The whores from the Scattering surely had melange as one of their targets—the spice and the Bene Gesserit mastery of it.\nTaraza returned to her table and sank into her chairdog, leaning back while it molded itself to her contours. It was a problem. A peculiar Bene Gesserit problem. Although they searched and experimented constantly, the Sisterhood had never found a substitute for the spice. The Spacing Guild might want melange to trance-form its navigators, but they could substitute Ixian machinery. Ix and its subsidiaries competed in the Guild’s markets. They had alternatives.\nWe have none.\nBellonda crossed to the other side of Taraza’s table, put both fists on the smooth surface and leaned forward to look down at the Mother Superior.\n“And we still don’t know what the Tleilaxu did to our ghola!”\n“Odrade will find out.”\n“Not reason enough to forgive her treachery!”\nTaraza spoke in a low voice: “We waited for this moment through generation after generation and you would abort the project just like that.” She slapped a palm lightly against the table.\n“The precious Rakian project is no longer our project,” Bellonda said. “It may never have been.”\nAll of her considerable mental powers in hard focus, Taraza reexamined the implications of this familiar argument. It was a thing spoken frequently in the wrangling session they had concluded earlier.\nWas the ghola scheme something set in motion by the Tyrant? If so, what could they do about it now? What should they do about it?\nDuring the long dispute, the Minority Report had been in all of their minds. Schwangyu might be dead but her faction survived and it looked now as though Bellonda had joined them. Was the Sisterhood blinding itself to a fatal possibility? Odrade’s report of that hidden message on Rakis could be interpreted as an ominous warning. Odrade emphasized this by reporting how she had been alerted by her inner sense of alarm. No Reverend Mother could treat such an event lightly.\nBellonda straightened and folded her arms across her breast. “We never completely escape the teachers of our childhood nor any of the patterns that formed us, do we?”\nThat was an argument peculiar to Bene Gesserit disputes. It reminded them of their own particular susceptibility.\nWe are the secret aristocrats and it is our offspring who inherit the power. Yes, we are susceptible to that and Miles Teg is a superb example.\nBellonda found a straight chair and sat down, bringing her eyes level with Taraza’s. “At the height of the Scattering,” she said, “we lost some twenty percent of our failures.”\n“It is not failures who are coming back to us.”\n“But the Tyrant surely knew this would happen!”\n“The Scattering was his goal, Bell. That was his Golden Path, humankind’s survival!”\n“But we know how he felt about the Tleilaxu and yet he did not exterminate them. He could have and he did not!”\n“He wanted diversity.”\nBellonda pounded a fist on the table. “He certainly got that!”\n“We've been through all of these arguments over and over, Bell, and | still see no way to escape what Odrade has done.”\n“Subservience!”\n“Not at all. Were we ever totally subservient to one of the pre-Tyrant emperors? Not even to Muad’Dib!”\n“We're still in the Tyrant’s trap,” Bellonda accused. “Tell me, why have the Tleilaxu continued to produce his favorite ghola? Millennia, and still that ghola keeps coming out of their tanks like a dancing doll.”\n“You think the Tleilaxu still follow a secret order from the Tyrant? If so, then you argue for Odrade. She has created admirable conditions for us to examine this.”\n“He ordered nothing of the kind! He merely made that particular ghola deliciously attractive to the Bene Tleilax.”\n“And not to us?”\n“Mother Superior, we must get ourselves out of the Tyrant’s trap now! And by the most direct method.”\n“The decision is mine, Bell. | still lean toward a cautious alliance.”\n“Then at the very least let us kill the ghola. Sheeana can have children. We could—”\n“This is not now and never was purely a breeding project!”\n“But it could be. What if you’re wrong about the power behind the Atreides prescience?”\n“All of your proposals lead to alienation from Rakis and from the Tleilaxu, Bell.”\n“The Sisterhood could weather fifty generations on our present stockpiles of melange. More with rationing.”\n“You think fifty generations is a long time, Bell? Don’t you see that this very attitude is why you are not sitting in my chair?”\nBellonda pushed herself back from the table, her chair scraping harshly against the floor. Taraza could see that she was not convinced. Bellonda no longer could be trusted. She\nmight be the one who would have to die. And where was the noble purpose in that?\n“This gets us nowhere,” Taraza said. “Leave me.”\nWhen she was alone, Taraza once more considered Odrade’s message. Ominous. It was easy to see why Bellonda and others reacted violently. But that showed a dangerous lack of control.\nIt is not yet time to write the Sisterhood’s final will and testament.\nIn an odd way, Odrade and Bellonda shared the same fear but came to different decisions because of that fear. Odrade’s interpretation of that message in the stones of Rakis conveyed an old warning:\nThis, too, shall pass away.\nAre we to end now, crushed by ravenous hordes from the Scattering?\nBut the secret of the axlotl tanks was almost within the Sisterhood’s grasp.\nIf we gain that, nothing can stop us!\nTaraza swung her gaze around the details of her room. The Bene Gesserit power was still here. Chapter House remained concealed behind a moat of no-ships, its location unrecorded except in the minds of her own people. Invisibility.\nTemporary invisibility! Accidents occurred.\nTaraza squared her shoulders. Take precautions but don’t live in their shadows, constantly furtive. The Litany Against Fear served a useful purpose when avoiding shadows.\nFrom anyone but Odrade, the warning message with its disturbing implications that the Tyrant still guided his Golden Path would\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c1ef317621452f3ccd6d988e968ac0b38335d01d41dcddc993ed3dba5af70c3a_v2"}
