That was why this rushing around and the Suk.\nBut who were all those others? Bene Gesserit robes in an abundance he had never before seen here. Not just acolytes. Reverend Mothers outnumbered the others he saw rushing about down there. They reminded him of great carrion birds. There went an acolyte at last, carrying a child on her shoulders. Very mysterious. /f only | had a link to Shipsystems!\nHe leaned against a wall and waited but the people vanished into various hatches and doorways. Some destinations he could place with fair certainty, others remained a mystery.\nBy the Holy Prophet! There went Mother Superior herself! She went through a wider doorway where most of the others\nhad gone.\nUseless to ask Odrade when next he saw her. She had him in her trap now.\nThe Prophet is here and in powindah hands!\nWhen no more people appeared in the corridor, Scytale returned to his quarters. The Identification monitor at his doorway flickered at his passage but he forced himself not to look at it. /D is the key. With his knowledge, this flaw in the Ixian ship’s control system beckoned like a siren.\nWhen | move, they will not give me much time.\nIt would be an act of desperation with ship and contents hostage. Seconds in which to succeed. Who knew what false panels might have been built, what secret hatches where those awful women could leap out at him. He dared not gamble before exhausting all other avenues. Especially now ... with the Prophet restored.\nTricky witches. What else did they change in this ship? A disquieting thought. Does my knowledge still apply?\nThe presence of Scytale beyond the barrier had not escaped Odrade’s notice but she had other matters to concern her. Murbella’s accouchement (she liked the ancient term) had come at an opportune moment. Odrade wanted a distracted Idaho with her for Sheeana’s attempt at restoring the Bashar’s memories. Idaho was often distracted by thoughts of Murbella. And Murbella obviously could not be with him here, not just now.\nOdrade maintained prudent watchfulness in his presence. He was, after all, a Mentat.\nShe had found him at his console again. As she emerged from the dropchute into the access corridor to his quarters, she heard the clicking of relays and that characteristic buzzing of the comfield and knew immediately where to find him.\nHe revealed an odd mood when she took him into the observation room where they would monitor Sheeana and the child.\nWorry about Murbella? Or about what they would presently see?\nThe observation room was long and narrow. Three rows of chairs faced the seewall common with the secret room where the experiment would occur. The observation area had been left in gray gloom with only two tiny glowglobes at upper corners behind the chairs.\nTwo Suks were present . . . although Odrade worried that they might be ineffective. Jalanto, the Suk Idaho considered their best, was with Murbella.\nDemonstrate our concern. It’s real enough.\nSlingchairs had been set up along the seewall. An emergency access hatch into the other room was near at hand.\nStreggi brought the child down the outer passage where he would not see the watchers and took him into the room. It had been prepared under Murbella’s directions: a bedroom, some of his own things brought from his quarters and some things from the rooms shared by Idaho and Murbella.\nAn animal’s cave, Odrade thought. There was a Shabbiness about the place that came from the deliberate disarray often found in Idaho’s chambers: discarded clothing on a slingchair, sandals in a corner. The sleeping mat was one Idaho and Murbella had used. Inspecting it earlier, Odrade had noted that smell akin to saliva, an intimate sexual odor. That, too, would work unconsciously on Teg.\nHere is where the wild things originate, the things we cannot suppress. What daring, to think we can control this. But we must.\nAs Streggi undressed the boy and left him naked on the mat, Odrade found her pulse quickening. She shifted her chair forward, noticing her Bene Gesserit companions imitate the same hitching motion.\nDear me, she thought. Are we nothing but voyeurs?\nSuch thoughts were necessary at this moment but she felt them demean her. She lost something in that intrusion. Extremely non-Bene Gesserit thinking. But very human!\nDuncan had lapsed into a studied air of indifference, an easily recognized pretense. Too much subjectivity in his thoughts for him to function well as a Mentat. And that was precisely how she wanted him now. Participation Mystique. Orgasm as energizer. Bell had recognized it correctly.\nTo one of three nearby Proctors, all chosen for strength and here ostensibly as observers, Odrade said: “The ghola wants his original memories restored and fears that utterly. That’s the major barrier to be sundered.”\n“Bullcrap!” Idaho said. “You know what we have working for us right now? His mother was one of you and she gave him the deep training. How likely is it she failed to protect him against your Imprinters?”\nOdrade turned sharply toward him. Mentat? No, he was back in his immediate past, reliving and making comparisons. That reference to Imprinters, though... Was that how the first “sexual collision” with Murbella restored memories of other ghola-lifetimes? Deep resistance against imprinting?\nThe Proctor Odrade had addressed chose to ignore this impertinent interruption. She had read the Archives material when Bellonda briefed her. All three of them knew they might be called on to kill the ghola-child. Did he have powers dangerous to them? The watchers would not know until (or unless) Sheeana succeeded.\nTo Idaho, Odrade said: “Streggi told him why he is here.”\n“What did she tell him?” Very peremptory with Mother Superior. The Proctors glared at him.\nOdrade held her voice to deliberate mildness. “Streggi told him Sheeana would restore his memories.”\n“What did he say?”\n“Why isn’t Duncan Idaho doing it?”\n“She answered him honestly?” Getting some of his own back.\n“Honestly but revealing nothing. Streggi told him Sheeana had a better way. And that you approved.”\n“Look at him! He isn’t even moving. You haven’t drugged him, have you?”\nIdaho glared back at the Proctors.\n“We wouldn’t dare. But he is focused inward. You do recall the necessity for that, don’t you?”\nIdaho sank back into his chair, shoulders slumping. “Murbella keeps saying: ‘He’s just a child. He’s just a child.’ You know we had a fight over it.”\n“I thought your argument pertinent. The Bashar was not a child. It’s the Bashar we're awakening.”\nHe raised crossed fingers. “I hope.”\nShe drew back, looking at the crossed fingers. “I didn’t know you were superstitious, Duncan.”\n“I’d pray to Dur if | thought it would help.”\nHe remembers his own re-awakening pains.\n“Don’t reveal compassion,” he muttered. “Turn it back on him. Keep him focused inward. You want his anger.”\nThose were words from his own practique.\nAbruptly, he said: “This may be the stupidest thing | ever suggested. | should go and be with Murbella.”\n“You're in good company, Duncan. And there’s nothing you can do for Murbella right now. Look!” As Teg leaped off the mat and stared up at the ceiling comeyes.\n“Isn't someone coming to help me?” Teg demanded. More desperation in his voice than predicted for this stage. “Where’s Duncan Idaho?”\nOdrade put a hand on Idaho’s arm as he hitched forward. “Stay where you are, Duncan. You can’t help him, either. Not yet.”\n“Isn't someone going to tell me what to do?” The young voice had a lonely, piping sound. “What're you going to do?”\nSheeana’s cue and she entered the room through a hidden hatch behind Teg. “Here | am.” She wore only a gossamer robe of pale blue, almost transparent. It clung to her as she strode around to face the boy.\nHe gawked. This was a Reverend Mother? He had never seen one robed that way. “You’re going to give me back my memories?” Doubt and desperation.\n“I will help you give them back to yourself.” As she spoke, she slipped out of the robe and tossed it aside. It floated to the floor like a great blue butterfly.\nTeg stared at her. “What're you doing?”\n“What do you think I’m doing?” She sat down beside him and put a hand on his penis.\nHis head tipped forward as though pushed from behind and he stared at her hand as an erection formed in it.\n“Why’re you doing that?”\n“Don’t you know?”\n“No!”\n“The Bashar would know.”\nHe looked up at her face so close to his. “You know! Why won't you tell me?”\n“I’m not your memory!”\n“Why’re you humming like that?”\nShe put her lips against his neck. The humming was clear to the watchers. Murbella called it an intensifier, feedback keyed to the sexual response. It grew louder.\n“What’re you doing?” Almost a shriek as she sat him astraddle of her. She swayed, massaging the small of his back.\n“Answer me, damn you!” A definite shriek.\nWhere did that “damn you!” come from? Odrade wondered.\nSheeana slipped him into her. “Here’s your answer!”\nHis mouth formed a soundless “Ohhhhhhhhh.”\nThe watchers saw her concentration on Teg’s eyes but Sheeana watched him with other senses as well.\n“Feel the tensing of his thighs, the telltale vagus pulse and especially note the darkening of his nipples. When you have him at that point, sustain it until his pupils dilate.”\n“Imprinter!” Teg’s scream made the watchers jump.\nHe beat his fists against Sheeana’s shoulders. All of them at the seewall observed an inner flickering of his eyes as he twisted back and forth, something new peering out of him.\nOdrade was on her feet. “Has something gone wrong?”\nIdaho remained in his chair. “What | predicted.”\nSheeana thrust Teg away to escape his clawing fingers.\nHe sprawled to the floor and whirled with a speed that shocked the watchers. Sheeana and Teg confronted each other for several long heartbeats. Slowly, he straightened and only then did he look down at himself. Presently, he lifted his attention to his left arm held in front of him. His gaze went to the ceiling, to each wall in turn. Again, he looked at his body.\n“What in the nether hell . . .” Still childish piping but oddly matured.\n“Welcome, ghola-Bashar,” Sheeana said.\n“You were trying to imprint me!” Angry accusation. “You think my mother didn’t teach me how to prevent that?” A distant expression came over his face. “Ghola?”\n“Some prefer to think of you as a clone.”\n“Who’re ...Sheeana!” He whirled, looking all around the room. It had been selected for its concealed access, no visible hatches. “Where are we?”\n“In the no-ship you took to Dune just before you were killed there\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a character who has recently given birth and is associated with the Bene Gesserit, a powerful organization in the narrative\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Suk are mentioned as a group, possibly medical professionals, involved in the events surrounding Murbella's childbirth\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive organization of women with advanced mental and physical abilities, deeply involved in the events of the narrative\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REVEREND MOTHERS<|>PERSON<|>Reverend Mothers are high-ranking members of the Bene Gesserit, possessing advanced abilities and knowledge\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER SUPERIOR<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior is the highest-ranking leader of the Bene Gesserit, overseeing their operations and strategies\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a key Bene Gesserit leader, involved in strategic decisions and the manipulation of events, including the memory restoration of the ghola-child\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>Scytale is a character with knowledge of the Ixian ship's control systems, plotting actions against the Bene Gesserit\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a Bene Gesserit member tasked with restoring the memories of the ghola-child, using unconventional methods\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a Mentat and a central figure in the narrative, involved in the events surrounding the ghola-child and Murbella\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is the ghola-child whose original memories are being restored, originally a military leader known as the Bashar\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STREGGI<|>PERSON<|>Streggi is a Bene Gesserit acolyte assisting in the care and preparation of the ghola-child\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JALANTO<|>PERSON<|>Jalanto is a Suk doctor, considered the best by Duncan Idaho, and is attending to Murbella\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Proctor involved in the oversight of the memory restoration experiment\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is mentioned as a location where Samuel Namara was held, though not directly part of this narrative\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN SHIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixian ship is a vessel with control systems known to Scytale, who plans to exploit its flaws\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GHOLA<|>PERSON<|>A ghola is a cloned individual with the potential to restore memories of their original self, central to the narrative's events\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BASHAR<|>PERSON<|>The Bashar is the original identity of the ghola-child Teg, a revered military leader\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Murbella is associated with the Bene Gesserit, possibly as a member or ally<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a high-ranking leader of the Bene Gesserit, directing their operations<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Sheeana is a member of the Bene Gesserit, tasked with critical missions<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MURBELLA<|>Duncan Idaho and Murbella are in a relationship, with Duncan deeply concerned for her<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>SHEEANA<|>Sheeana is restoring Teg's memories, a deeply personal and transformative process<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BASHAR<|>Teg is the ghola of the Bashar, with the potential to restore his original memories<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>IXIAN SHIP<|>Scytale has knowledge of the Ixian ship's control systems and plans to exploit them<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Odrade manipulates Duncan Idaho's involvement in the memory restoration experiment<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JALANTO<|>MURBELLA<|>Jalanto, a Suk doctor, is attending to Murbella during her childbirth<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>STREGGI<|>TEG<|>Streggi assists in preparing Teg for the memory restoration process<|>6\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
