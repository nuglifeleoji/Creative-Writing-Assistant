In that respect, you have been brought to the level of regimental commander.”\n“Better than Patrin?”\n“Why must you be better than Patrin?”\n“Wasn't he your comrade?”\n“Yes.”\n“You said he never rose above squad leader!”\n“Patrin was fully capable of taking over command of an entire multi-planet force. He was a tactical magician whose wisdom | employed on many occasions.”\n“But you said he never—”\n“It was his choice. The low rank gave him the common touch that we both found useful many times.”\n“Regimental commander?” Duncan’s voice was little more than a whisper. He stared at the tabletop.\n“You have an intellectual grasp of the functions, a bit impetuous but experience usually smooths that out. Your weapons skills are superior for your age.”\nStill not looking at Teg, Duncan asked: “What is my age... sir?”\nJust as the instructions cautioned: “The ghola will dance all around the central issue. ‘What is my age?’ How old is a ghola?”\nHis voice coldly accusing, Teg said: “If you want to know your ghola-age, why don’t you ask that?”\n“Wha... what is that age, sir?”\nThere was such a weight of misery in the youthful voice that Teg felt tears start in the corners of his eyes. He had been warned about this, too. “Do not reveal too much compassion!” Teg covered the moment by clearing his throat. He said: “That’s a question only you can answer.”\nThe instructions were explicit: “Turn it back on him! Keep him focused inward. Emotional pain is as important to this process as the physical pain.”\nA deep sigh shuddered through Duncan. He closed his eyes tightly. When Teg had first seated himself at the table, Duncan had thought: /s this the moment? Will he do it now? But Teg’s accusing tone, the verbal attacks, were completely unexpected. And now Teg sounded patronizing.\nHe’s patronizing me!\nCynical anger surged into Duncan. Did Teg think him such a fool that he could be taken in by the most common ploy of a commander? Tone of voice and attitude alone can subjugate another’s will. Duncan sensed something else in the patronizing, though: a core of plasteel that would not be penetrated. Integrity ... purpose. And Duncan had seen the tears start, the covering gesture.\nOpening his eyes and looking directly at Teg, Duncan said: “I don’t mean to be disrespectful or ungrateful or rude, sir. But | can’t go on without answers.”\nTeg’s instructions were clear: “You will know when the ghola reaches the point of desperation. No ghola will try to hide this. It is intrinsic to their psyche. You will recognize it in voice and posture.”\nDuncan had almost reached the critical point. Silence was mandatory for Teg now. Force Duncan to ask his questions, to take his own course.\nDuncan said: “Did you know that | once thought of killing Schwangyu?”\nTeg opened his mouth and closed it without a sound. Silence! But the lad was serious!\n“I was afraid of her,” Duncan said. “I don’t like being afraid.” He lowered his gaze. “You once told me that we only hate what’s really dangerous to us.”\n“He will approach it and retreat, approach and retreat. Wait until he plunges.”\n“| don’t hate you,” Duncan said, looking once more at Teg. “I resented it when you said ghola to my face. But Lucilla’s right: We should never resent the truth even when it hurts.”\nTeg rubbed his own lips. The desire to speak filled him but it was not yet plunge time.\n“Doesn't it surprise you that | considered killing Schwangyu?” Duncan asked.\nTeg held himself rigid. Even the shaking of his head would be taken as a response.\n“I thought of slipping something into her drink,” Duncan said. “But that’s a coward’s way and I’m not a coward. Whatever else, I’m not that.”\nTeg remained silently immobile.\n“I think you really care what happens to me, Bashar,” Duncan said. “But you’re right: we will never be comrades. If | survive, | will Surpass you. Then... it will be too late for us to be comrades. You spoke the truth.”\nTeg was unable to prevent himself from inhaling a deep breath of Mentat realization: no avoiding the signs of strength in the ghola. Somewhere recently, perhaps in this very alcove just now, the youth had ceased being a youth and had become a man. The realization saddened Teg. It went so fast! No normal growing-up in between.\n“Lucilla does not really care what happens to me the way you do,” Duncan said. “She’s just following her orders from that Mother Superior, Taraza.”\nNot yet! Teg cautioned himself. He wet his lips with his tongue.\n“You have been obstructing Lucilla’s orders,” Duncan said. “What is it she’s Supposed to do to me?”\nThe moment had come. “What do you think she’s Supposed to do?” Teg demanded.\n“| don’t know!”\n“The original Duncan Idaho would know.”\n“You know! Why won't you tell me?”\n“I’m only supposed to help restore your original memories.”\n“Then do it!”\n“Only you can really do it.”\n“I don’t know how!”\nTeg sat forward on the edge of his chair, but did not speak. Plunge point? He sensed something lacking in Duncan’s desperation.\n“You know I can read lips, sir,” Duncan said. “Once | went up to the tower observatory. | saw Lucilla and Schwangyu down below talking. Schwangyu said: ‘Never mind that he’s so young! You’ve had your orders.’”\nOnce more cautiously silent, Teg stared back at Duncan. It was like Duncan to move around secretly in the Keep, spying, seeking Knowledge. And he had seated himself in that memory-mode now, not realizing that he still was spying and seeking... but in a different way.\n“|I didn’t think she was supposed to kill me,” Duncan said. “But you know what she was supposed to do because you've been obstructing her.” Duncan pounded a fist on the table. “Answer me, damn you!”\nAhhhh, full desperation!\n“I can only tell you that what she intends conflicts with my orders. | was commanded by Taraza herself to strengthen you and guard you from harm.”\n“But you said my training was... was flawed!”\n“Necessary. It was done to prepare you for your original memories.”\n“What am | supposed to do?”\n“You already know.”\n“| don’t, I tell you! Please teach me!”\n“You do many things without having been taught them. Did we teach you disobedience?”\n“Please help me!” It was a desperate wail.\nTeg forced himself to chilly remoteness. “What in the nether hell do you think I’m doing?”\nDuncan clenched both fists and pounded them on the table, making his cup dance. He glared at Teg. Abruptly, an odd expression came over Duncan’s face—something grasping in his eyes.\n“Who are you?” Duncan whispered.\nThe key question!\nTeg’s voice was a lash striking out at a suddenly defenseless victim: “Who do you think | am?”\nA look of utter desperation twisted Duncan’s features. He managed only a gasping stutter: “You’re... you're...”\n“Duncan! Stop this nonsense!” Teg jumped to his feet and stared down with assumed rage.\n“You're...”\nTeg’s right hand shot out in a swift arc. The open palm cracked against Duncan’s cheek. “How dare you disobey me?” Left hand out, another rocking slap. “How dare you?”\nDuncan reacted so swiftly that Teg experienced an electric instant of absolute shock. Such speed! Although there were separate elements in Duncan’s attack, it occurred in one fluid blur: a leap upward, both feet on the chair, rocking the chair, using that motion to slash the right arm down at Teg’s vulnerable shoulder nerves.\nResponding out of trained instincts, Teg dodged sideways and flailed his left leg over the table into Duncan’s groin. Teg still did not completely escape. The heel of Duncan’s hand continued downward to strike beside the knee of Teg’s flailing leg. It numbed the whole leg.\nDuncan sprawled across the tabletop, trying to slide backward in spite of the disabling kick. Teg supported himself, left hand on table, and chopped with the other hand to the base of Duncan’s spine, into the nexus deliberately weakened by the exercises of the past few days.\nDuncan groaned as paralyzing agony shot through his body. Another person would have been immobilized, screaming, but Duncan merely groaned as he clawed toward Teg, continuing the attack.\nRelentless in the necessities of the moment, Teg proceeded to create greater pain in his victim, making sure each time that Duncan saw the attacker’s face at the instant of greatest agony.\n“Watch his eyes!” the instructions warned. And Bellonda, reinforcing the procedure, had cautioned: “His eyes will seem to look through you but he will call you Leto.”\nMuch later. Teg found difficulty in recalling each detail of his obedience to the reawakening procedure. He knew that he continued to function as commanded but his memory went elsewhere, leaving the flesh free to carry out his orders. Oddly, his trick memory fastened onto another act of disobedience: the Cerbol Revolt, himself at middle age but already a Bashar with a formidable reputation. He had donned his best uniform without its medals (a subtle touch, that) and had presented himself in the scorching noon heat of Cerbol’s battle-plowed fields. Completely unarmed in the path of the advancing rebels!\nMany among the attackers owed him their lives. Most of them had once given him their deepest allegiance. Now, they were in violent disobedience. And Teg’s presence in their path said to those advancing soldiers:\n“I will not wear the medals that tell what | did for you when we were comrades. | will not be anything that says | am one of you. | wear only the uniform that announces that | am still the Bashar. Kill me if that is how far you will carry your disobedience.”\nWhen most of the attacking force threw down their arms and came forward, some of their commanders bent the knee to their old Bashar and he remonstrated: “You never needed to bow to me or get on your knees! Your new leaders have taught you bad habits.”\nLater, he told the rebels he shared some of their grievances. Cerbol had been badly misused. But he also warned them:\n“One of the most dangerous things in the universe is an ignorant people with real grievances. That is nowhere near as dangerous, however, as an informed and intelligent society with grievances. The damage that vengeful intelligence can wreak, you cannot even imagine. The Tyrant would seem a benevolent father figure by comparison with what you were about to create!”\nIt was all true, of course, but in a Bene Gesserit context, and it helped little with what he was commanded to do to the Duncan Idaho ghola—creating mental and physical agony in an almost helpless victim.\nEasiest to recall was the look in Duncan’s eyes. They did not change focus, but glared directly up into Teg’s face, even at the instant of the final screaming shout:\n“Damn you, Leto! What are you doing?”\nHe called me Leto.\nTeg limped backward two steps. His left leg tingled and ached where Duncan had struck it. Teg realized that he was panting and at the end\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6454395344e79ba3aa5945ce61a4ef4ce7f7273818faef2175219599b20451b0_v2"}
