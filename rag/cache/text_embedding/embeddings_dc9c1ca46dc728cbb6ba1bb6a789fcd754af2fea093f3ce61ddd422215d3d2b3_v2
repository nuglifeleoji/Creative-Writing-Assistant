the offering? And is this not the response: ‘God send each man at his end, such hawks, such eagles, and such friends’?”\nNamri’s hand slid from his knife. The blade slipped back into its sheath. He stared wide-eyed at Leto. Each sietch kept its friendship ritual secret, yet here was a selected part of the rite.\nHalleck, though, asked: “Is this place your end?”\n“I know what you need to hear from me, Gurney,” Leto said, watching the play of hope and suspicion across the ugly face. Leto touched his own breast. “This child was never a child. My father lives within me, but he is not me. You loved him, and he was a gallant human whose affairs beat upon high shores. His intent was to close down the cycle of wars, but he reckoned without the movement of infinity as expressed by life. That’s Rhajia! Namri knows. Its movement can be seen by any mortal. Beware paths which narrow future possibilities. Such paths divert you from infinity into lethal traps.”\n“What is it | need to hear from you?” Halleck asked.\n“He’s just word playing,” Namri said, but his voice carried deep hesitation, doubts.\n“Tally myself with Namri against my father,” Leto said. “And my father within allies himself with us against what was made of him.”\n“Why?” Halleck demanded.\n“Because it’s the amor fati which | bring to humankind, the act of ultimate self-examination. In this universe, | choose to ally myself against any force which brings humiliation upon humankind. Gurney! Gurney! You were not\nborn and raised in the desert. Your flesh doesn’t know the truth of which | speak. But Namri knows. In the open land, one direction is as good as another.”\n“I still have not heard what | must hear,” Halleck snarled.\n“He speaks for war and against peace,” Namri said.\n“No,” Leto said. “Nor did my father speak against war. But look what was made of him. Peace has only one meaning in this Imperium. It’s the maintenance of a single way of life. You are commanded to be contented. Life must be uniform on all planets as it is in the Imperial Government. The major object of priestly study is to find the correct forms of human behavior. For this they go to the words of Muad’Dib! Tell me, Namri, are you content?”\n“No.” The word came out flat, spontaneous rejection.\n“Then do you blaspheme?”\n“Of course not!”\n“But you aren’t contented. You see, Gurney? Namri proves it to us. Every question, every problem doesn’t have a single correct answer. One must permit diversity. A monolith is unstable. Then why do you demand a single correct statement from me? Is that to be the measure of your monstrous judgment?”\n“Will you force me to have you slain?” Halleck asked, and there was agony in his voice.\n“No, l'Il have pity upon you,” Leto said. “Send word to my grandmother that l'Il cooperate. The Sisterhood may come to regret my cooperation, but an Atreides gives his word.”\n“A Truthsayer should test that,” Namri said. “These Atreides...”\n“He'll have his chance to say before his grandmother what must be said,” Halleck said. He nodded with his head toward the passage.\nNamri paused before leaving, glanced at Leto. “I pray we do the right thing in leaving him alive.”\n“Go, friends,” Leto said. “Go and reflect.”\nAs the two men departed, Leto threw himself onto his back, feeling the cold cot against his spine. Movement sent his head spinning over the edge of his spice- burdened consciousness. In that instant he saw the entire planet— every village, every town, every city, the desert places and the planted places. All of the shapes which smashed against his vision bore intimate relationships to a mixture of elements within themselves and without. He saw the structures of Imperial society reflected in physical structures of its planets and their communities. Like a gigantic unfolding within him, he saw this revelation for what it must be: a window into the society’s invisible parts. Seeing this, Leto realized that every system had such a window. Even the system of himself and his universe. He began peering into windows, a cosmic voyeur.\nThis was what his grandmother and the Sisterhood sought! He knew it. His awareness flowed on a new, higher level. He felt the past carried in his cells, in his memories, in the archetypes which haunted his assumptions, in the myths which hemmed him, in his languages and their prehistoric detritus. It was all of the shapes out of his human and nonhuman past, all of the lives which he now commanded, all integrated in him at last. And he felt himself as a thing caught up in the ebb and flow of nucleotides. Against the backdrop of infinity he was a protozoan creature in which birth and death were virtually simultaneous, but he was both infinite and protozoan, a creature of molecular memories.\nWe humans are a form of colony organism! he thought.\nThey wanted his cooperation. Promising cooperation had won him another reprieve from Namri’s knife. By summoning to cooperation, they sought to recognize a healer.\nAnd he thought: But l'Il not bring them social order in the way they expect it!\nA grimace contorted Leto’s mouth. He knew he’d not be as unconsciously malevolent as was his father—despotism at one terminal and slavery at the other—but this universe might pray for those “good old days.”\nHis father-within spoke to him then, cautiously probing, unable to demand attention but pleading for audience.\nAnd Leto answered: “No. We will give them complexities to occupy their minds. There are many modes of flight from danger. How will they know I’m dangerous unless they experience me for thousands of years? Yes, father-within, we'll give them question marks.”\nThere is no guilt or innocence in you. All of that is past. Guilt belabors the dead and | am not the Iron Hammer. You multitude of the dead are merely people who have done certain things, and the memory of those things illuminates my path.\n—LETO II TO HIS MEMORY-LIVES AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\n44] t moves of itself!” Farad’n said, and his voice was barely a whisper.\nHe stood above the Lady Jessica’s bed, a brace of guards close behind him. The Lady Jessica had propped herself up in the bed. She was clad in a parasilk gown of shimmering white with a matching band around her copper hair. Farad’n had come bursting in upon her moments before. He wore the grey leotard and his face was sweaty with excitement and the exertions of his dash through the palace corridors.\n“What time is it?” Jessica asked.\n“Time?” Farad’n appeared puzzled.\nOne of the guards spoke up: “It is the third hour past midnight, My Lady.” The guard glanced fearfully at Farad’n. The young prince had come dashing through the night- lighted corridors, picking up startled guards in his wake.\n“But it moves,” Farad’n said. He held out his left hand, then his right. “I saw my own hands shrink into chubby fists, and | remembered! They were my hands when I was an infant. | remembered being an infant, but it was...a clearer memory. | was reorganizing my old memories!”\n“Very good,” Jessica said. His excitement was infectious. “And what happened when your hands became old?”\n“My ... mind was... sluggish,” he said. “I felt an ache in my back. Right here.” He touched a place over his left\nkidney.\n“You've learned a most important lesson,” Jessica said. “Do you know what that lesson is?”\nHe dropped his hands to his sides, stared at her. Then: “My mind controls my reality.” His eyes glittered, and he repeated it, louder this time: “My mind controls my reality!”\n“That is the beginning of prana-bindu balance,” Jessica said. “It is only the beginning, though.”\n“What do | do next?” he asked.\n“My Lady,” the guard who had answered her question ventured now to interrupt. “The hour,” he said.\nAren't their soy posts manned at this hour? Jessica wondered. She said: “Begone. We have work to do.”\n“But My Lady,” the guard said, and he looked fearfully from Farad’n to Jessica and back.\n“You think I’m going to seduce him?” Jessica asked.\nThe man stiffened.\nFarad’n laughed, a joyous outburst. He waved a hand in dismissal. “You heard her. Begone.”\nThe guards looked at each other, but they obeyed.\nFarad’n sat on the edge of her bed. “What next?” He shook his head. “I wanted to believe you, yet | did not believe. Then... it was as though my mind melted. | was tired. My mind gave up its fighting against you. It happened. Just like that!” He snapped his fingers.\n“It was not me that your mind fought against,” Jessica said.\n“Of course not,” he admitted. “I was fighting against myself, all the nonsense I’ve learned. What next now?”\nJessica smiled. “I confess | didn’t expect you to succeed this rapidly. It’s been only eight days and...”\n“I was patient,” he said, grinning.\n“And you’ve begun to learn patience, too,” she said.\n“Begun?”\n“You've just crept over the lip of this learning,” she said. “Now you're truly an infant. Before... you were only a\npotential, not even born.”\nThe corners of his mouth drew down.\n“Don’t be so gloomy,” she said. “You’ve done it. That’s important. How many can say they were born anew?”\n“What comes next?” he insisted.\n“You will practice this thing you’ve learned,” she said. “I want you able to do this at will, easily. Later you'll fill a new place in your awareness which this has opened. It will be filled by the ability to test any reality against your own demands.”\n“Is that alll do now... practice the—”\n“No. Now you can begin the muscle training. Tell me, can you move the little toe on your left foot without moving any other muscle of your body?”\n“My...” She saw a distant expression come over his face as he tried to move the toe. He looked down at his foot presently, staring at it. Sweat broke out on his forehead. A deep breath escaped him. “I can’t do it.”\n“Yes you can,” she said. “You will learn to do it. You will learn every muscle in your body. You will know these muscles the way you know your hands.”\nHe swallowed hard at the magnitude of this prospect. Then: “What are you doing to me? What is your plan for me?”\n“I intend to turn you loose upon the universe,” she said. “You will become whatever it is you most deeply desire.”\nHe mulled this for a moment. “Whatever | desire?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s impossible!”\n“Unless you learn to control your desires the way you control your reality,” she said. And she thought: There! Let his analysts examine that. They'll advise cautious approval, but Farad’n will move a step closer to realization of what I’m really doing.\nHe proved his surmise by saying: “It’s one thing to tell a person he'll realize his heart’s desire. It’s another thing to\nactually deliver that realization.”\n“You", " you can,” she said. “You will learn to do it. You will learn every muscle in your body. You will know these muscles the way you know your hands.”\nHe swallowed hard at the magnitude of this prospect. Then: “What are you doing to me? What is your plan for me?”\n“I intend to turn you loose upon the universe,” she said. “You will become whatever it is you most deeply desire.”\nHe mulled this for a moment. “Whatever | desire?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s impossible!”\n“Unless you learn to control your desires the way you control your reality,” she said. And she thought: There! Let his analysts examine that. They'll advise cautious approval, but Farad’n will move a step closer to realization of what I’m really doing.\nHe proved his surmise by saying: “It’s one thing to tell a person he'll realize his heart’s desire. It’s another thing to\nactually deliver that realization.”\n“You've come farther than | thought,” Jessica said. “Very good. | promise you: if you complete this program of learning, you'll be your own man. Whatever you do, it'll be because that’s what you want to do.”\nAnd let a Truthsayer try to pry that apart, she thought.\nHe stood up, but the expression he bent upon her was warm, a sense of camaraderie in it. “You know, | believe you. Damned if | Know why, but | do. And | won’t say a word about the other things I’m thinking.”\nJessica watched his retreating back as he let himself out of her bedchamber. She turned off the glowglobes, lay back. This Farad’n was a deep one. He’d as much as told her that he was beginning to see her design, but he was joining her conspiracy of his own volition.\nWait until he begins to learn his own emotions, she thought. With that, she composed herself for the return to sleep. The morrow, she knew, would be plagued by casual encounters with palace personnel asking seemingly innocuous questions.\nHumankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs, thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence. In this periodic race, any pause becomes luxury. Only then can one reflect that all is permitted; all is possible.\n—THE APOCRYPHA OF MUAD’DIB\nT touch of sand is important, Leto told himself.\nHe could feel the grit beneath him where he sat beneath a brilliant sky. They had force-fed him another heavy dosage of melange, and Leto’s mind turned upon itself like a whirlpool. An unanswered question lay deep within the funnel of the whirlpool: Why do they insist that I say it? Gurney was stubborn: no doubt of that. And he’d had his orders from his Lady Jessica.\nThey’d brought him out of the sietch into the daylight for this “lesson.” He had the strange sensation that he’d let his body take the short trip from the sietch while his inner being mediated a battle between the Duke Leto | and the old Baron Harkonnen. They’d fought within him, through him, because he would not let them communicate directly. The fight had taught him what had happened to Alia. Poor Alia.\n| was right to fear the spice trip, he thought.\nA welling bitterness toward the Lady Jessica filled him. Her damned gom jabbar! Fight it and win, or die in the attempt. She couldn’t put a poisoned needle against his neck, but she could send him into the valley of peril which had claimed her own daughter.\nSnuffling sounds intruded upon his awareness. They wavered, growing louder, then softer, louder . . . softer. There was no way for him to determine whether they had current reality or came from the spice.\nLeto’s body sagged over his folded arms. He felt hot sand through his buttocks. There was a rug directly in front of him, but he sat on open sand. A shadow lay across the rug: Namri. Leto stared into the muddy pattern of the rug, feeling bubbles ripple there. His awareness drifted on its own current through a landscape which stretched out to a horizon of shock-headed greenery.\nHis skull thrummed with drums. He felt heat, fever. The fever was a pressure of burning which filled his senses, crowding out awareness of flesh until he could only feel the moving shadows of his peril. Namri and the knife. Pressure... pressure... Leto lay at last suspended between sky and sand, his mind lost to all but the fever. Now he waited for something to happen, sensing that any occurrence would be a first-and-only thing.\nHot-hot pounding sunshine crashed brilliantly around him, without tranquillity, without remedy. Where is my Golden Path? Everywhere bugs crawled. Everywhere. My skin is not my own. He sent messages along his nerves, waited out the dragging other-person responses.\nUp head, he told his nerves.\nA head which might have been his own crept upward, looked out at patches of blankness in the bright light.\nSomeone whispered: “He’s deep into it now.”\nNo answer.\nBurn fire sun building heat on heat.\nSlowly, outbending, the current of his awareness took him drifting through a last screen of green blankness and there, across low folding dunes, distant no more than a kilometer beyond the stretched out chalk line of a cliff, there lay the green burgeoning future, upflung, flowing into endless green, greenswelling, green-green moving outward endlessly.\nIn all of that green there was not one great worm.\nRiches of wild growth, but nowhere Shai-Hulud.\nLeto sensed that he had ventured across old boundaries into a new land which only the imagination had witnessed, and that he looked now directly through the very next veil which a yawning humankind called Unknown.\nIt was bloodthirsty reality.\nHe felt the red fruit of his life swaying on a limb, fluid Slipping away from him, and the fluid was the spice essence flowing through his veins.\nWithout Shai-Hulud, no more spice.\nHe had seen a future without the great grey worm- serpent of Dune. He knew this, yet could not tear himself from the trance to rail against such a passage.\nAbruptly his awareness plunged back—back, back, away from such a deadly future. His thoughts went into his bowels, becoming primitive, moved only by intense emotions. He found himself unable to focus on any particular aspect of his vision or his surroundings, but there was a voice within him. It spoke an ancient language and he understood it perfectly. The voice was musical and lilting, but its words bludgeoned him.\n“It is not the present which influences the future, thou fool, but the future which forms the present. You have it all backward. Since the future is set, an unfolding of events which will assure that future is fixed and inevitable.”\nThe words transfixed him. He felt terror rooted in the heavy matter of his body. By this he knew his body still existed, but the reckless nature and enormous power of his vision left him feeling contaminated, defenseless, unable to signal a muscle and gain its obedience. He knew he was Submitting more and more to the onslaught of those collective lives whose memories once had made him believe he was real. Fear filled him. He thought that he might be losing the inner command, falling at last into Abomination.\nLeto felt his body twisting in terror.\nHe had come to depend upon his victory and the newly won benevolent cooperation of those memories. They had\nturned against him, all of them—even royal Harum whom he’d trusted. He lay shimmering on a surface which had no roots, unable to give any expression to his own life. He tried to concentrate upon a mental picture of himself, was confronted by overlapping frames, each a different age: infant into doddering ancient. He recalled his father’s early training: Let the hands grow young, then old. But his whole body was immersed now in this lost reality and the entire image progression melted into other faces, the features of those who had given him their memories.\nA diamond thunderbolt shattered him.\nLeto felt pieces of his awareness drifting apart, yet he retained a sense of himself somewhere between being and nonbeing. Hope quickening, he felt his body breathing. In... Out. He took in a deep breath: yin. He let it out: yang.\nSomewhere just beyond his grasp lay a place of supreme independence, a victory over all of the confusions inherent in his multitude of lives—no false sense of command, but a true victory. He knew his previous mistake now: he had sought power in the reality of his trance, choosing that rather than face the fears which he and Ghanima had fed in each other.\nFear defeated Alia!\nBut the seeking after power spread another trap, diverting him into fantasy. He saw the illusion. The entire illusion process rotated half a turn and now he knew a center from which he could watch without purpose the flight of his visions, of his inner lives.\nElation flooded him. It made him want to laugh, but he denied himself this luxury, knowing it would bar the doors of memory.\nAhhhh, my memories, he thought. / have seen your illusion. You no longer invent the next moment for me. You merely show me how to create new moments. l'Il not lock myself on the old tracks.\nThis thought passed through his awareness as though wiping a surface clean and in its wake he felt his entire body, an e/nfa//e which reported in most minute detail on every cell, every nerve. He entered a state of intense quiet. In this quiet, he heard voices, knowing they came from a great distance, but he heard them clearly as though they echoed in a chasm.\nOne of the voices was Halleck’s. “Perhaps we gave him too much of it.”\nNamri answered. “We gave him exactly what she told us to give him.”\n“Perhaps we should go back out there and have another look at him.” Halleck.\n“Sabiha is good at such things; she'll call us if anything starts to go wrong.” Namri.\n“| don’t like this business of Sabiha.” Halleck.\n“She’s a necessary ingredient.” Namri.\nLeto felt bright light outside himself and darkness within, but the darkness was secretive, protective, and warm. The light began to blaze up and he felt that it came from the darkness within, swirling outward like a brilliant cloud. His body became transparent, drawing him upward, yet he retained that e/nfa//e contact with every cell and nerve. The multitude of inner lives fell into alignment, nothing tangled or mixed. They became very quiet in duplication of his own inner silence, each memory-life discrete, an entity incorporeal and undivided.\nLeto spoke to them then: “I am your spirit. | am the only life you can realize. | am the house of your spirit in the land which is nowhere, the land which is your only remaining home. Without me, the intelligible universe reverts to chaos. Creative and abysmal are inextricably linked in me; only | can mediate between them. Without me, mankind will sink into the mire and vanity of Knowing. Through me, you and they will find the only way out of chaos: understanding by living.”\nWith this he let go of himself and became himself, his own person compassing the entirety of his past. It was not victory, not defeat, but a new thing to be shared with any inner life he chose. Leto savored this newness, letting it possess every cell, every nerve, giving up what the e/nfalle had presented to him and recovering the totality in the same instant.\nAfter a time, he awoke in white darkness. With a flash of awareness he knew where his flesh was: seated on sand about a kilometer from the cliff wall", " the land which is nowhere, the land which is your only remaining home. Without me, the intelligible universe reverts to chaos. Creative and abysmal are inextricably linked in me; only | can mediate between them. Without me, mankind will sink into the mire and vanity of Knowing. Through me, you and they will find the only way out of chaos: understanding by living.”\nWith this he let go of himself and became himself, his own person compassing the entirety of his past. It was not victory, not defeat, but a new thing to be shared with any inner life he chose. Leto savored this newness, letting it possess every cell, every nerve, giving up what the e/nfalle had presented to him and recovering the totality in the same instant.\nAfter a time, he awoke in white darkness. With a flash of awareness he knew where his flesh was: seated on sand about a kilometer from the cliff wall which marked the northern boundary of the sietch. He knew that sietch now: Jacurutu for certain... and Fondak. But it was far different from the myths and legends and the rumors which the smugglers allowed.\nA young woman Sat on a rug directly in front of him, a bright glowglobe anchored to her left sleeve and drifting just above her head. When Leto looked away from the glowglobe, there were stars. He knew this young woman; she was the one from his vision earlier, the roaster of coffee. She was Namri’s niece, as ready with a knife as Namri was. There was the knife in her lap. She wore a simple green robe over a grey stillsuit. Sab/ha, that was her name. And Namri had his own plans for her.\nSabiha saw the awakening in his eyes, said: “It’s almost dawn. You’ve spent the whole night here.”\n“And most of a day,” he said. “You make good coffee.”\nThis statement puzzled her, but she ignored it with a single-mindedness which spoke of harsh training and explicit instructions for her present behavior.\n“It’s the hour of assassins,” Leto said. “But your knife is no longer needed.” He glanced at the crysknife in her lap.\n“Namri will be the judge of that,” she said.\nNot Halleck, then. She only confirmed his inner knowledge.\n“Shai-Hulud is a great garbage collector and eraser of unwanted evidence,” Leto said. “I’ve used him thus myself.”\nShe rested her hand lightly on the knife handle.\n“How much is revealed by where we sit and how we sit,” he said. “You sit upon the rug and | upon the sand.”\nHer hand closed over the knife handle.\nLeto yawned, a gaping and stretching which made his jaws ache. “I’ve had a vision which included you,” he said.\nHer shoulders relaxed slightly.\n“We've been very one-sided about Arrakis,” he said. “Barbaric of us. There’s a certain momentum in what we've been doing, but now we must undo some of our work. The scales must be brought into better balance.”\nA puzzled frown touched Sabiha’s face.\n“My vision,” he said. “Unless we restore the dance of life here on Dune, the dragon on the floor of the desert will be no more.”\nBecause he’d used the Old Fremen name for the great worm, she was a moment understanding him. Then: “The worms?”\n“We're in a dark passage,” he said. “Without spice, the Empire falls apart. The Guild will not move. Planets will Slowly lose their clear memories of each other. They’ll turn inward upon themselves. Space will become a boundary when the Guild navigators lose their mastery. We’ll cling to our dunetops and be ignorant of that which is above us and below us.”\n“You speak very strangely,” she said. “How have you seen me in your vision?”\nTrust Fremen superstition! he thought. He said: “I’ve become pasigraphic. I’m a living glyph to write out the changes which must come to pass. If | do not write them, you'll encounter such heartache as no human should experience.”\n“What words are these?” she asked, but her hand remained lightly on the knife.\nLeto turned his head toward the cliffs of Jacurutu, seeing the beginning glow which would be Second Moon making its\npredawn passage behind the rocks. The death-scream of a desert hare shocked its way through him. He saw Sabiha shudder. There came the beating of wings—a predator bird, night creature here. He saw the ember glow of many eyes as they swept past above him, headed for crannies in the cliff.\n“I must follow the dictates of my new heart,” Leto said. “You look upon me as a mere child, Sabiha, but if—”\n“They warned me about you,” Sabiha said, and now her shoulders were stiff with readiness.\nHe heard the fear in her voice, said: “Don’t fear me, Sabiha. You’ve lived eight more years than this flesh of mine. For that, | honor you. But | have untold thousands more years of other lives, far more than you have known. Don’t look upon me as a child. I have bridged the many futures and, in one, saw us entwined in love. You and |, Sabiha.”\n“What are ... This can’t...” She broke off in confusion.\n“The idea could grow on you,” he said. “Now help me back to the sietch, for I’ve been in far places and am weak with the weariness of my travels. Namri must hear where | have been.”\nHe saw the indecision in her, said: “Am I not the Guest of the Cavern? Namri must learn what I have learned. We have many things to do lest our universe degenerate.”\n“| don’t believe that... about the worms,” she said.\n“Nor about us entwined in love?”\nShe shook her head. But he could see the thoughts drifting through her mind like windblown feathers. His words both attracted and repelled her. To be consort of power, that certainly carried high allure. Yet there were her uncle’s orders. But one day this son of Muad’Dib might rule here on Dune and in the farthest reaches of their universe. She encountered then an extremely Fremen, cavern-hiding aversion to such a future. The consort of Leto would be seen\nby everyone, would be an object of gossip and speculations. She could have wealth, though, and...\n“I am the son of Muad’Dib, able to see the future,” he said.\nSlowly she replaced her knife in its sheath, lifted herself easily from the rug, crossed to his side and helped him to his feet. Leto found himself amused by her actions then: she folded the rug neatly and draped it across her right shoulder. He saw her measuring the difference in their sizes, reflecting upon his words: Entwined in love?\nSize is another thing that changes, he thought.\nShe put a hand on his arm then to help him and control him. He stumbled and she spoke sharply: “We're too far from the sietch for that!” Meaning the unwanted sound which might attract a worm.\nLeto felt that his body had become a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect. He knew this shell: it was one with the society which had been built upon the melange trade and its Religion of the Golden Elixir. It was emptied by its excesses. Muad’Dib’s high aims had fallen into wizardry which was enforced by the military arm of Augaf. Muad’Dib’s religion had another name now; it was Shien-san-Shao, an Ixian label which designated the intensity and insanity of those who thought they could bring the universe to paradise at the point of a crysknife. But that too would change as Ix had changed. For they were merely the ninth planet of their sun, and had even forgotten the language which had given them their name.\n“The Jihad was a kind of mass insanity,” he muttered.\n“What?” Sabiha had been concentrating on the problem of making him walk without rhythm, hiding their presence out here on open sand. She was a moment focusing on his words, then interpreted them as another product of his obvious fatigue. She felt the weakness of him, the way he’d been drained by the trance. It seemed pointless and cruel to her. If he were to be killed as Namri said, then it should be\ndone quickly without all of this byplay. Leto had spoken of a marvelous revelation, though. Perhaps that was what Namri sought. Certainly that must be the motive behind the behavior of this child’s own grandmother. Why else would Our Lady of Dune give her sanction to these perilous acts against a child?\nChild?\nAgain she reflected upon his words. They were at the cliff base now and she stopped her charge, letting him relax a moment here where it was safer. Looking down at him in the dim starlight, she asked: “How could there be no more worms?”\n“Only | can change that,” he said. “Have no fear. | can change anything.”\n“But it’s—”\n“Some questions have no answers,” he said. “I’ve seen that future, but the contradictions would only confuse you. This is a changing universe and we are the strangest change of all. We resonate to many influences. Our futures need constant updating. Now, there’s a barrier which we must remove. This requires that we do brutal things, that we go against our most basic, our dearest wishes... . But it must be done.”\n“What must be done?”\n“Have you ever killed a friend?” he asked and, turning, led the way into the gap which sloped upward to the sietch’s hidden entrance. He moved as quickly as his trance- fatigue would permit, but she was right behind him, clutching his robe and pulling him to a stop.\n“What’s this of killing a friend?”\n“He'll die anyway,” Leto said. “I don’t have to do it, but | could prevent it. If | don’t prevent it, is that not killing him?”\n“Who is this... who will die?”\n“The alternative keeps me silent,” he said. “I might have to give my sister to a monster.”\nAgain he turned away from her, and this time when she pulled at his robe he resisted, refusing to answer her questions. Best she not know until the time comes, he thought.\nNatural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny. Where humans are concerned, though, this is an extremely limiting viewpoint. Reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation. It raises many questions, including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs, or whether environment plays a pre-selective role in determining the variations which it screens. Dune did not really answer those questions: it merely raised new questions which Leto and the Sisterhood may attempt to answer over the next five hundred generations.\n—THE DUNE CATASTROPHE AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\nhe bare brown rocks of the Shield Wall loomed in the\ndistance, visible to Ghanima as the embodiment of that apparition which threatened her future. She stood at the edge of the roof garden atop the Keep, the setting sun at her back. The sun held a deep orange glow from intervening dust clouds, a color as rich as the rim of a worm’s mouth. She sighed, thinking: Alia... Alia . . . IS your fate to be my fate?\nThe inner lives had grown increasingly clamorous of late. There was something about female conditioning in a Fremen society—perhaps it was a real sexual difference, but whatever—the female was more susceptible to that inner tide. Her grandmother had warned about it"], "parameters": {"model": "text-embedding-ada-002"}}, "key": "embeddings_dc9c1ca46dc728cbb6ba1bb6a789fcd754af2fea093f3ce61ddd422215d3d2b3_v2"}
