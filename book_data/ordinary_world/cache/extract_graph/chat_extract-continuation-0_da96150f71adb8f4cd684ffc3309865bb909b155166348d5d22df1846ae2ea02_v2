一些生活的经历。当年，他们还为一些事闹过孩子式的别扭。现在想起来，连这些别扭都值得人怀恋！中学时代的生活啊，将永远鲜活地保持在每个人一生的记忆之中；即是我们进入垂暮之年，我们也常常会把记忆的白帆，驶回到那些金色的年月里……“干杯！” \n　　四个人把酒杯碰在了一起。 \n　　他们一边喝酒，一边热烈地交谈着。当然，话题一开始总要回首往事的。只不过，三个男人都小心翼翼，谁也不提起郝红梅的名字……唉，你们呀！你们大概只知道可怜的红梅结婚了，可是她怎样悲惨地生活着你们知道吗？你们难道都忘记了这个不幸的人吗？ \n　　不，也许他们谁都没有忘记这个人，只是这个场所不宜谈论她罢了。保姆开始上热菜。顾养民有素养地把菜分别夹到每个人面前的小碟里。四个命运不尽相同的同学这顿饭吃得很融洽。顾养民和田晓霞觉得，尽管孙少平和金波目前都没有工作，但在他们面前一点也不自卑，而且言辞谈吐和对生活的见解，并不比他们低。尤其是孙少平，思想和眼界都很开阔，有些观点使两个大学生都有点震惊。在少平和金波这方面看来，顾养民和田晓霞虽然进了大学门，在他们面前也不自视骄傲，象对待真正的朋友那样诚恳和尊重。几杯酒下肚，四个人的情绪高昂起来。晓霞提议一人唱一支歌。他们四个人曾经一块参加过中学的文艺宣传队，这方面都是人才，便立刻响应晓霞的建议，开始再一次重温过去的快乐。晓霞带头先唱了电影《冰山上的来客》中的两支插曲。接着金波唱了他最动情的《在那遥远的地方》——直唱得自己泪花子在眼里打转。少平和养民合唱了深沉的美国民歌《老人河》…… \n　　这是一个多么美好的夜晚呀！ \n　　一直到晚上十一点，这个欢乐的聚会才结束。顾养民和田晓霞把少平和金波从学校里送出来。他们在大门外挥手告别…… \n　　少平和有点醉意的金波相跟着，走在夜晚温暖而宁静的大街上，情绪仍然有些激动。 \n　　从北关走到麻雀山下的丁字路口，他们也要分手了——金波回东关的邮政所；少平要到南关的柴油机厂去。分手时，金波醉意朦胧地对少平说：“顾养民和田晓霞是不是在谈……”话还没说完，他见少平脸色有点不太对劲，立刻清醒过来，没有再说下去。他这才想到，少平一直和晓霞关系很要好——他这句该死的话一定引得少平心里难过！ \n　　噢，年轻的朋友们，你们是不是还会重演一次过去那样的爱情之剧呢？ \n
