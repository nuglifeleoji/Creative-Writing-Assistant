直到此时，刘锋才举起手中的白龙枪，带着淡淡的冰雾，刺出白龙枪，瞬间将那片青影化解。他的行动看起来轻松自如，有种毫不费力的感觉。\n\n    也就在这时，一个嘹亮的鸣叫声响起，一道身影猛地从召唤之门中飞出，速度奇快无比，几乎只是一闪身就到了半空之中，直接冲向了从天而降，准备攻击钱磊的金翔。\n\n    金翔没想到这召唤物来得这么快，有些猝不及防，但他的战斗经验也算丰富，身体在空中一转，背后烈金鸟双翼挥动，宛如两柄侧刀一般，带着炽热的气流斩向那道身影。\n\n    “噗!”光芒一闪，金翔甚至没有完全反应过来，他的身体就已经在空中凝滞了。\n\n    下一瞬间，他才从天而降，而那攻击了他的身影此时才在空中略微停顿了一下。它这一停顿，就让所有人看清了它的模样。\n\n    很小，这是所有人的第一感觉。那是一只通体呈翠色的小鸟，只有嘴是红色的，看起来才巴掌大小，但一双翠绿色的小眼睛之中闪着凶狠的光芒。“翠魔鸟?”蓝轩宇口中发出一声低呼，眼中闪过一抹诧异的光芒。\n\n    他的惊讶源自这只被召唤出来的魂兽，眼下的情形似乎和他们以前试验的情况有所不同。\n\n    以前他跟钱磊配合，从来都没召唤出过翠魔鸟。\n\n    从之前的尝试来看，用右手金纹蓝银草辅助召唤之门，召唤出来的生物几乎都带有一些龙类的血脉，这也让蓝轩宇对自己的武魂有了一些新的认识。\n\n    他隐约感觉到，自己的金纹蓝银草应该和龙类有关，很可能金纹本身就是龙纹。\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百一十九章 恐怖翠魔鸟\n\n    可眼前的翠魔鸟，在记载中可从未听说过和龙族有关系啊，也不是有龙族血脉的魂兽。难道说，召唤出问题了？\n\n    当然，翠魔鸟可不弱，正相反的是，以蓝轩宇的魂兽知识，他完全可以肯定，这只翠魔鸟甚至是他们先前召唤出的所有魂兽中最强大的一个。\n\n    它在魂兽的世界中有凶鸟之称，凶性十足，专门喜欢击杀其他魂兽，吃其脑髓。不但速度奇快无比，而且攻击力也是超强，专门攻击其他生物的头部。\n\n    此时正从天而降化为光芒的金翔，额头上就有一个血洞，显然是被它击穿了头部，烈阳双翼根本连碰都没碰到这位。\n\n    竟然是翠魔鸟啊！\n\n    翠魔鸟几乎是所有�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
