The fact that the banished Reverend Mother had penetrated this far aroused Odrade’s curiosity. A persistent Reverend Mother could cross ordinary barriers but these barriers were not ordinary. Dortujla’s reason for coming already had been told. Others had heard and passed her. It was apparent that Dortujla had not relied on Bene Gesserit wiles to persuade her Sisters. That would have brought immediate rejection. No time for such nonsense! So she had observed the chain of command. Her action spoke of careful assessment, a message within whatever message she brought.\n“Bring her.”\nDortujla had aged smoothly on her backwater planet. She revealed her years mostly in shallow wrinkles around her mouth. The hood of her robe concealed her hair but the eyes peering from beneath it were bright and alert.\n“Why are you here?” Odrade’s tone said: “This had damned well better be important.”\nDortujla’s story was straightforward enough. She and three Reverend Mother associates had spoken to a band of\nFutars from the Scattering. Dortujla’s post had been searched out and asked to get a message to Chapterhouse. Dortujla had filtered the request through Truthsense, she said, reminding Mother Superior that even in backwaters there could be some talent. Judging the message truthful, her Sisters concurring, Dortujla had acted with speed, not unmindful of caution.\n“All due dispatch in our own no-ship,” was the way she put it. The ship, she said, was small, a smuggler type.\n“One person can operate it.”\nThe heart of the message was fascinating. Futars wished to ally themselves with Reverend Mothers in opposition to Honored Matres. How much of a force these Futars commanded was difficult to assess, Dortujla said.\n“They refused to say when | asked.”\nOdrade had assessed many stories about Futars. Killers of Honored Matres? There were reasons to believe it but Futar performance was confusing, especially in accounts from Gammu.\n“How many in this party?”\n“Sixteen Futars and four Handlers. That’s what they called themselves: Handlers. And they say Honored Matres have a dangerous weapon they can use only once.”\n“You only mentioned Futars. Who are these Handlers? And what is this about a secret weapon?”\n“| reserved mention of them. They appear to be human within variables noted from the Scattering: three men and a woman. As to the weapon, they would not say more.”\n“Appear to be human?”\n“There you have it, Mother Superior. | had the odd first impression they were Face Dancers. None of the criteria applied. Pheromones negative. Gestures, expressions— everything negative.”\n“Just that first impression?”\n“I cannot explain it.”\n“What of the Futars?”\n“They matched the descriptions. Human in outward appearance but with unmistakable ferocity. Cat family origins, | would judge.”\n“So others have said.”\n“They speak but it’s an abbreviated Galach. Word bursts, | thought them. ‘When eat?’ ‘You nice lady.’ ‘Want head scratch.’ ‘Sit here?’ They appeared immediately responsive to the Handlers but not fearful. Between Futars and Handlers | had the impression there was mutual respect and liking.”\n“Knowing the risks, why did you think this important enough to bring immediately?”\n“These are people from the Scattering. Their offer of alliance is an opening into places where Honored Matres originate.”\n“You asked about them, of course. And about conditions in the Scattering.”\n“No answers.”\nThe fact, simply stated. One could not sneer at the banished Sister no matter how much of a cloud she carried over her past. More questions were indicated. Odrade asked them, observing closely as answers came, watching the old mouth like a withered fruit opening purple and closing pink.\nSomething in Dortujla’s service, the long years of penitence perhaps, had gentled her but left the core of Bene Gesserit toughness untouched. She spoke with natural hesitancy. Her gestures were softly fluid. She looked at Odrade with kindness. (There was the flaw her Sisters condemned: Bene Gesserit cynicism held at bay.)\nDortujla interested Odrade. Sister to Sister, she spoke, a strong and well-composed mind behind her words. A mind toughened by adversity in the years at a punishment post. Doing what she could now to make up for that lapse of her youth. No attempt to appear some time-server not up on current affairs. An account pared to essentials. Let it be known that she had as full as possible an awareness of\nnecessities. Bowed to Mother Superior’s decisions and caution about the dangerous visit but still felt that “you should have this information.”\n“I’m convinced it’s not a trap.”\nDortujla’s demeanor was above reproach. Direct gaze, eyes and face held in proper composure but no attempts at concealment. A Sister could read through this mask for a proper assessment. Dortujla acted from a sense of urgency. She had been a fool once but she no longer was a fool.\nWhat was the name of her punishment planet?\nThe worktable’s projector produced it: Buzzell.\nThat name brought an alertness to Odrade. Buzzell! Her fingers danced in the console, confirming memories. Buzzell: mostly ocean. Cold. Very cold. Hardscrabble islands, none bigger than a large no-ship. The Bene Gesserit once had considered Buzzell a punishment. Object lesson: “Careful, girl, or you’ll be sent to Buzzell.” Odrade recalled the other key then: soostones. Buzzell was a place where they had naturalized the monoped sea creature, Cholister, whose abraded carapace produced marvelous tumors, one of the most valued jewels in the universe.\nSoostones.\nDortujla was wearing one of the things just visible above the tuck of her neckline. The workroom light turned it an elegant blend of deeply glowing sea-green and mauve. It was larger than a human eyeball, flaunted there like a declaration of wealth. They probably thought little of such decorations on Buzzell. Pick them up on the beaches.\nSoostones. That was significant. By Bene Gesserit design, Dortujla had frequent dealings with smugglers. (Witness her possession of that no-ship.) This must be addressed with care. No matter the Sister-to-Sister discussion, it was still Mother Superior and Reverend Mother from a punishment planet.\nSmuggling. A major crime to Honored Matres and others who had not faced the fact of unenforceable laws. Foldspace\nhad not changed it for smuggling, just made small intrusions easier if anything. Tiny no-ships. How small could you make one of them? A gap in Odrade’s knowledge. Archives corrected it: “Diameter, meters 140.”\nSmall enough, then. Soostones were a cargo with natural attraction. Foldspace was a critical economic barrier: How valuable a cargo compared to size and mass? You could spend many Solars moving massive stuff. Soostones— magnetic to smugglers. They had special interest to Honored Matres as well. Simple economics? Always a big market. As attractive to smugglers as melange now that the Guild was being so free with it. The Guild had always stockpiled with generations of spice in scattered storage and (doubtless) many hidden backups.\nThey think they can buy immunity from Honored Matres! But that offered something she sensed might be turned to advantage. In their wild anger, Honored Matres had destroyed Dune, only known natural source of melange. Still unthinking of consequences (odd, that), they had eliminated the Tleilaxu, whose axlotl tanks had flooded the Old Empire with spice.\nAnd we have creatures capable of recreating Dune. We also may have the only living Tleilaxu Master. Locked in Scytale’s mind—the way to turn axlotl tanks into a melange cornucopia. If we can get him to reveal it.\nThe immediate problem was Dortujla. The woman conveyed her ideas with a conciseness that did her credit. Handlers and their Futars, she said, were disturbed by something they would not reveal. Dortujla had been wise not to attempt Bene Gesserit persuasives. No telling how people from the Scattering might react. But what disturbed them?\n“Some threat other than Honored Matres,” Dortujla suggested. She would not venture more but the possibility was there and had to be considered.\n“The essential thing is that they say they want an alliance,” Odrade said.\n“Common cause for a common problem,” was the way they had put it. Despite Truthsense, Dortujla advised only a cautious exploration of the offer.\nWhy go to Buzzell at all? Because Honored Matres had missed Buzzell or judged it insignificant in their angry sweeps?\n“Not likely,” Dortujla said.\nOdrade agreed. Dortujla, no matter how grubby her Original posting, now commanded a valuable property and, much more important, she was a Reverend Mother with a no-ship to take her to Mother Superior. She knew the location of Chapterhouse. Useless to the hunters, of course. They knew a Reverend Mother would kill herself before betraying that secret.\nProblems compounded problems. But first, some Sisterly Sharing. Dortujla was sure to make a correct interpretation of Mother Superior’s motives. Odrade shifted the conversation into personal matters.\nIt went well. Dortujla was clearly amused but willing to talk.\nReverend Mothers on lonely posts tended to have what Sisters called “other interests.” An earlier age had called them hobbies but attention devoted to interests often was extreme. Odrade thought most interests boring but found it significant that Dortujla called hers a hobby. She collected old coins, did she?\n“What kind?”\n“I have two early Greek in silver and a perfect gold obol.”\n“Authentic?”\n“They're real.” Meaning she had done a self-scan of Other Memory to authenticate them. Fascinating. She exercised her abilities in a strengthening way, even with her hobby. Inner history and exterior coincided.\n“This is all very interesting, Mother Superior,” Dortujla said finally. “I appreciate your reassurance that we are still Sisters and find your interest in ancient paintings a parallel hobby. But we both know why I risked coming here.”\n“The smugglers.”\n“Of course. Honored Matres cannot have overlooked my presence on Buzzell. Smugglers will sell to the high bidders. We must assume they have profited from their valuable knowledge about Buzzell, the soostones, and a resident Reverend Mother with attendants. And we must not forget that Handlers found me.”\nDamn! Odrade thought. Dortujla is the kind of advisor | like to have near me. | wonder how many more such buried treasures are out there, tucked away for mean motives? Why do we so often shunt our talented ones aside? It’s an ancient weakness the Sisterhood has not exorcised.\n“I think we have learned something valuable about Honored Matres,” Dortujla said.\nThere was no need to nod agreement. This was the core of what had brought Dortujla to Chapterhouse. The ravening hunters had come swarming into the Old Empire, killing and burning wherever they suspected the presence of Bene Gesserit establishments. But the hunters had not touched Buzzell even though its location must be known.\n“Why?” Odrade asked, voicing what was in their minds.\n“Never damage your own nest,” Dortujla said.\n“You think they’re already on Buzzell?”\n“Not yet.”\n“But you believe\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DORTUJLA<|>PERSON<|>Dortujla is a banished Reverend Mother who has aged smoothly on her backwater planet.
