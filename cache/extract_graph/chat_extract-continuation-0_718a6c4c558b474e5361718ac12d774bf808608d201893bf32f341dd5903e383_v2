Spice liquor? she asked herself. She took the siphon tube in her mouth, pulled up only the most minuscule sip. It tasted of the spice, a faint bite acrid on the tongue.\nChani pressed down on the skin bag. A great gulp of the stuff surged into Jessica’s mouth and before she could help herself, she swallowed it, fighting to retain her calmness and dignity.\n“To accept a little death is worse than death itself,” Chani said. She stared at Jessica, waiting.\nAnd Jessica stared back, still holding the spout in her mouth. She tasted the sack’s contents in her\nnostrils, in the roof of her mouth, in her cheeks, in her eyes—a biting sweetness, now.\nCool.\nAgain, Chani sent the liquid gushing into Jessica’s mouth.\nDelicate.\nJessica studied Chani’s face—elfin features— seeing the traces of Liet-Kynes there as yet unfixed by time.\nThis is a drug they feed me, Jessica told herself.\nBut it was unlike any other drug of her experience, and Bene Gesserit training included the taste of many drugs.\nChani’s features were so clear, as though outlined in light.\nA drug.\nWhirling silence settled around Jessica. Every fiber of her body accepted the fact that something profound had happened to it. She felt that she was a conscious mote, smaller than any subatomic particle, yet capable of motion and of sensing her Surroundings. Like an abrupt revelation—the curtains whipped away—she realized she had become aware of a psychokinesthetic extension of herself. She was the mote, yet not the mote.\nThe cavern remained around her—the people. She sensed them: Paul, Chani, Stilgar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo.\nReverend Mother!\nAt the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the Reverend Mother ordeal, that the drug took them.\nJessica focused her attention on the Reverend Mother Ramallo, aware now that all this was happening in a frozen instant of time—suspended time for her alone.\nWhy is time suspended? she asked herself. She Stared at the frozen expressions around her, seeing a dust mote above Chani’s head, stopped there.\nWaiting.\nThe answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness: her personal time was Suspended to save her life.\nShe focused on the psychokinesthetic extension of herself, looking within, and was confronted immediately with a cellular core, a pit of blackness from which she recoiled.\nThat is the place where we cannot look, she thought. There is the place the Reverend Mothers are so reluctant to mention—the place where only a Kwisatz Haderach may look.\nThis realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a mote-self that searched within her for danger.\nShe found it within the drug she had swallowed.\nThe stuff was dancing particles within her, its motions so rapid that even frozen time could not stop them. Dancing particles. She began recognizing familiar structures, atomic linkages: a carbon atom here, helical wavering...a glucose molecule. An entire chain of molecules confronted her, and she recognized a protein...a methyl-protein configuration.\nAh-h-h!\nIt was a soundless mental sigh within her as she saw the nature of the poison.\nWith her psychokinesthetic probing, she moved into it, shifted an oxygen mote, allowed another carbon mote to link, reattached a linkage of oxygen... hydrogen.\nThe change spread...faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened its surface of contact.\nThe suspension of time relaxed its hold upon her, and she sensed motion. The tube spout from the sack was touched to her mouth—gently, collecting a drop of moisture.\nChani’s taking the catalyst from my body to change the poison in that sack, Jessica thought. Why?\nSomeone eased her to a sitting position. She saw the old Reverend Mother Ramallo being brought to sit beside her on the carpeted ledge. A dry hand touched her neck.\nAnd there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness! Jessica tried to reject it, but the mote swept closer...closer.\nThey touched!\nIt was like an ultimate simpatico, being two people at once: not telepathy, but mutual awareness.\nWith the old Reverend Mother!\nBut Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn’t think of herself as old. An image unfolded before the mutual mind’s eye: a young girl with a dancing spirit and tender humor.\nWithin the mutual awareness, the young girl said, “Yes, that is how | am.”\nJessica could only accept the words, not respond to them.\n“You'll have it all soon, Jessica,” the inward image said.\nThis is hallucination, Jessica told herself.\n“You know better than that,” the inward image said. “Swiftly now, do not fight me. There isn’t much time. We....” There came a long pause, then: “You Should’ve told us you were pregnant!”\nJessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. “Why?”\n“This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?”\nJessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness, saw another mote-presence with the inward eye. The other mote darted wildly here, there, circling. It radiated pure terror.\n“You'll have to be strong,” the old Reverend Mother’s image-presence said. “Be thankful it’s a daughter you carry. This would’ve killed a male fetus. Now...carefully, gently...touch your daughter- presence. Be your daughter-presence. Absorb the fear...soothe...use your Courage and your strength... gently now...gently....”\nThe other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch it.\nTerror threatened to overwhelm her.\nShe fought it the only way she knew: “/ shall not fear. Fear is the mind-killer....”\nThe litany brought a semblance of calm. The other mote lay quiescent against her.\nWords won’t work, Jessica told herself.\nShe reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a warm snuggling of protection.\nThe terror receded.\nAgain, the presence of the old Reverend Mother asserted itself, but now there was a tripling of mutual awareness—two active and one that lay quietly absorbing.\n“Time compels me,” the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. “I have much to give you. And | do not know if your daughter can accept all this while remaining sane. But it must be: the needs of the tribe are paramount.”\n“What—”\n“Remain silent and accept!”\nExperiences began to unroll before Jessica. It was like a lecture strip in a subliminal training projector at the Bene Gesserit school...but faster...blindingly faster.\nYet...distinct.\nShe knew each experience as it happened: there was a lover—virile, bearded, with the Fremen eyes, and Jessica saw his strength and tenderness, all of him in one blink-moment, through the Reverend Mother’s memory.\nThere was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the daughter fetus, only time to accept and record. The experiences poured in on Jessica— birth, life, death—important matters and unimportant, an outpouring of single-view time.\nWhy should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory? she asked herself.\nToo late, Jessica saw what was happening: the old woman was dying and, in dying, pouring her experiences into Jessica’s awareness as water Is poured into a cup. The other mote faded back into pre-birth awareness as Jessica watched it. And, dying- in-conception, the old Reverend Mother left her life in Jessica’s memory with one last sighing blur of words.\n“I’ve been a long time waiting for you,” she said. “Here is my life.”\nThere it was, encapsuled, all of it.\nEven the moment of death.\nlam now a Reverend Mother, Jessica realized.\nAnd she knew with a generalized awareness that she had become, in truth, precisely what was meant by a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. The poison drug had transformed her.\nThis wasn’t exactly how they did it at the Bene Gesserit school, she knew. No one had ever introduced her to the mysteries of it, but she knew.\nThe end result was the same.\nJessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness, probed it without response.\nA terrible sense of loneliness crept through Jessica in the realization of what had happened to her. She saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed and all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer.\nThe sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as her body relaxed from the threat of the poison, but still she felt that other mote, touching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it.\nI did it, my poor, unformed, dear little daughter, | brought you into this universe and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any defenses.\nA tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured into it, came from the other mote.\nBefore Jessica could respond, she felt the adab presence of demanding memory. There was something that needed doing. She groped for it, realizing she was being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her senses.\n/ could change that, she thought. / could take away the drug action and make it harmless. But she sensed this would be an error. /’m within a rite of Joining.\nThen she knew what she had to do.\nJessica opened her eyes, gestured to the watersack now being held above her by Chani.\n“It has been blessed,” Jessica said. “Mingle the waters, let the change come to all, that the people may partake and share in the blessing.”\nLet the catalyst do its work, she thought. Let the people drink of it and have their awareness of each other heightened for a while. The drug is safe now... now that a Reverend Mother has changed it.\nStill, the demanding memory worked on her, thrusting. There was another thing she had to do, she realized, but the drug made it difficult to focus.\nAh-h-h-h-h...the old Reverend Mother.\n“I have met the Reverend Mother Ramallo,” Jessica said. “She is gone, but she remains. Let her memory be honored in the rite.”\nNow, where did I get those words? Jessica wondered.\nAnd she realized they came from another memory, the /ife that had been given to her and now was part of herself. Something about that gift felt incomplete, though.\n“Let them have their orgy,” the other-memory said within her. “They’ve little enough pleasure out of living. Yes, and you and I need this little time to become acquainted before | recede and pour out through your memories. Already, | feel myself being tied to bits of you. Ah-h-h, you’ve a mind filled with interesting things. So many things I’d never imagined.”\nAnd the memory-mind encapsulated within her opened itself to Jessica, permitting a view down a wide corridor to other Reverend Mothers until there seemed no end to them.\nJessica recoiled, fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness. Still, the corridor remained, revealing to Jessica that the Fremen culture was far older than she had suspected.\nThere had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an easy planet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on Bela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus.\nOh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting.\nFar down the corridor, an image-voice screamed: “They denied us the Hajj!”\nJessica saw the slave cribs on Bel\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is remembered by Jessica for his drunkenness and the smell of spice liquor associated with him.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Chani is a Fremen woman who interacts with Jessica, offering her a drink and participating in the ritual.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Bene Gesserit who undergoes a transformative experience with the spice drug, becoming a Reverend Mother.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is present in the cavern and sensed by Jessica during her transformation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen leader present in the cavern during Jessica's transformation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO<|>PERSON<|>The Reverend Mother Ramallo is an old Fremen Reverend Mother who transfers her memories to Jessica before dying.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIET-KYNES<|>PERSON<|>Liet-Kynes is a Fremen leader whose features are seen in Chani's face.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced training and abilities, including the Reverend Mother ordeal.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a desert-dwelling people with a rich culture and rituals, including the rite of Joining.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KWISATZ HADERACH<|>PERSON<|>The Kwisatz Haderach is a prophesied male Bene Gesserit who can look into the place where Reverend Mothers cannot.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER ORDEAL<|>EVENT<|>The Reverend Mother ordeal is a transformative and potentially lethal ritual involving the consumption of a poison drug.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RITE OF JOINING<|>EVENT<|>The rite of Joining is a Fremen ritual where the transformed drug is shared among the people to heighten their awareness.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>CHANI<|>Chani administers the spice drug to Jessica, initiating her transformation into a Reverend Mother.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO<|>The Reverend Mother Ramallo transfers her memories and experiences to Jessica before dying.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit and undergoes their Reverend Mother ordeal.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>FREMEN<|>Jessica participates in Fremen rituals and becomes a Reverend Mother within their culture.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANI<|>LIET-KYNES<|>Chani has elfin features that show traces of Liet-Kynes.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO<|>FREMEN<|>The Reverend Mother Ramallo is a Fremen leader who passes her memories to Jessica.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>KWISATZ HADERACH<|>Jessica realizes that only a Kwisatz Haderach can look into the place where Reverend Mothers cannot.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>REVEREND MOTHER ORDEAL<|>Jessica undergoes the Reverend Mother ordeal, transforming her into a Reverend Mother.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>RITE OF JOINING<|>Jessica participates in the rite of Joining, blessing the waters for the Fremen people.<|>7\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
