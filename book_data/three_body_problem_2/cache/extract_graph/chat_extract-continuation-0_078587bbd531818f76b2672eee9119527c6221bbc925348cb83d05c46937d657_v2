发布，将在地球国际和舰队国际中掀起巨大波澜。\n　　肯和罗宾逊现在正在林格一斐兹罗监测站中，这个监测站处在小行星带外侧的太阳轨道上。在距监测站五公里处的太空中，飘浮着一个太阳系中最怪异的东西，那是一组六个的巨型透镜，最上面的一个直径达一千二百米。后面的五个尺寸要小一些，这就是最新一代的太空望远镜。与以前的五代哈勃望远镜不同，这个太空望远镜没有镜筒，甚至六个巨型镜片之间也没有任何联接物，它们各自独立飘浮着，每个镜片的边缘上都装有多台离子推进器，它们可以借助这些推进器精确地改变彼此的相对距离，也可以改变整个透镜组的指向。林格一斐兹罗监测站是太空望远镜的控制中心，但即使从这样近的距离上，也几乎看不到透明的透镜组。但在进行维护工作时，工程师和技师会飞到透镜之间，这时他们就发现两侧的宇宙发生了怪异的扭曲，如果一侧透镜处于合适的角度，镜面的防护虹膜反射阳光，巨型透镜就完全可见了。这时它那弧形的表面看上去像是一个布满妖艳彩虹的星球。这一代太空望远镜不再以哈勃命名，而是叫林格——斐兹罗望远镜，以纪念首次发现三体舰队踪迹的那两个人，尽管他们的发现没什么学术意义，但三大舰队联合建造的这座巨型望远镜。主要用途还是监视三体舰队。\n　　望远镜的负责人一直延用着林格和斐兹罗这样的组合：首席科学家来自地球，军事负责人则来自舰队。每一届组合都有着与林格和斐兹罗之问相似的争论。\n　　现在，肯博士总是想挤出观测时间来进行自己的宇宙学研究，而罗宾逊则以维护舰队的利益极力阻止。他们还有一些其他方面的争议，比如肯总是回忆当年以美国为首的各地球大国是多么出色地领导世界，现在的三大舰队又是多么的官僚和低效率，而罗宾逊则每次都无情地戳穿肯博士那可笑的历史幻觉。不过最激烈的争议还是在监测站的自转速度上，将军坚持只产生低重力的慢速旋转，甚至干脆不自转，让站内处于美妙的失重状态；而肯则坚持要产生标准地球重力的自转速度。\n　　现在发生的事情压倒了一切。所谓探测器熄灭，是说它的发动机关闭了。远在奥尔特星云之外，三体舰体探测器就开始减速，减速时它的发动机对着太阳方向启动，太空望远镜就是根据探测器发动机发出的光来对其进行跟踪，而发动机的光芒一旦熄灭，这种跟踪就不可能进行了，因为探测器本身实在�\n######################\nOutput:",
