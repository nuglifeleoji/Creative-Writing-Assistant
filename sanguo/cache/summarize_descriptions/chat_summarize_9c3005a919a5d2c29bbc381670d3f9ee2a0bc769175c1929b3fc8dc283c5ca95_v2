During this meeting, 诸葛瑾 attempted to persuade 孙权 to consider a peaceful resolution and the return of certain territories, indicating a complex diplomatic relationship that was crucial for maintaining stability in the region.\n\nIn addition to his role as a negotiator for peace, 诸葛瑾 also acted as an envoy for 孙权 in efforts to establish a marriage alliance with the family of 关云长 (Guan Yu), further illustrating the intertwining of personal and political relationships in the era.
