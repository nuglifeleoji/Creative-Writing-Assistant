Fremen-wise, he sensed his body’s moisture being wasted with every breath. Leto brought a section of the membrane over his mouth, rolled it back when it tried to seal his nostrils, kept at this until the rolled barrier remained in place. In the desert way, he fell into the automatic breathing pattern: in through his nose, out through his mouth. The membrane over his mouth protruded in a small bubble, but remained in place. No moisture collected on his lips and his nostrils remained open. The adaptation proceeded, then.\nA 'thopter flew between Leto and the moon, banked, and came in for a spread-wing landing on the butte perhaps a hundred meters to his left. Leto glanced at it, turned, and looked back the way he had come up the canyon. Many lights could be seen down there beyond the qanat, a stirring of a multitude. He heard faint outcries, sensed hysteria in the sounds. Two men approached him from the ‘thopter. Moonlight glinted on their weapons.\nThe Mashhad, Leto thought, and it was a sad thought. Here was the great leap onto the Golden Path. He had put on the living, self-repairing stillsuit of a sandtrout membrane, a thing of Uunmeasurable value on Arrakis... until you understood the price. /am no longer human. The legends about this night will grow and magnify it beyond anything recognizable by the participants. But it will become truth, that legend.\nHe peered down from the butte, estimated the desert floor lay two hundred meters below. The moon picked out ledges and cracks on the steep face but no connecting pathway. Leto stood, inhaled a deep breath, glanced back at the approaching men, then stepped to the cliff’s edge and launched himself into space. Some thirty meters down his flexed legs encountered a narrow ledge. Amplified muscles absorbed the shock and rebounded in a leap sideways to another ledge, where he caught a narrow outcropping with his hands, dropped twenty meters, leaped to another\nhandhold and once more went down, bouncing, leaping, grasping tiny ledges. He took the final forty meters in one jump, landing in a bent-knee roll which sent him plunging down the slipface of a dune in a shower of sand and dust. At the bottom he scrambled to his feet, launched himself to the next dunecrest in one jump. He could hear hoarse shouts from atop the cliff but ignored them to concentrate on the leaping strides from dunetop to dunetop.\nAs he grew more accustomed to amplified muscles he found a sensuous joy that he had not anticipated in this distance-gulping movement. It was a ballet on the desert, defiance of the Tanzerouft which no other had ever experienced.\nWhen he judged that the ornithopter’s occupants had overcome their shock enough to mount pursuit once more, he dove for the moon-shadowed face of a dune, burrowed into it. The sand was like heavy liquid to his new strength, but the temperature mounted dangerously when he moved too fast. He broke free on the far face of the dune, found that the membrane had covered his nostrils. He removed it, sensed the new skin pulsing over his body in its labor to absorb his perspiration.\nLeto fashioned a tube at his mouth, drank the syrup while he peered upward at the starry sky. He estimated he had come fifteen kilometers from Shuloch. Presently a ’thopter drew its pattern across the stars, a great bird shape followed by another and another. He heard the soft swishing of their wings, the whisper of their muted jets.\nSipping at the living tube, he waited. First Moon passed through its track, then Second Moon.\nAn hour before dawn Leto crept out and up to the dunecrest, examined the sky. No hunters. Now he knew himself to be embarked upon a path of no return. Ahead lay the trap in Time and Space which had been prepared as an unforgettable lesson for himself and all of mankind.\nLeto turned northeast and loped another fifty kilometers before burrowing into the sand for the day, leaving only a tiny hole to the surface which he kept open with a sandtrout tube. The membrane was learning how to live with him as he learned how to live with it. He tried not to think of the other things it was doing to his flesh.\nTomorrow l'Il raid Gara Rulen, he thought. /’// smash their qanat and loose its water into the sand. Then l'Il go on to Windsack, Old Gap, and Harg. In a month the ecological transformation will have been set back a full generation. That’ll give us space to develop the new timetable.\nAnd the wildness of the rebel tribes would be blamed, of course. Some would revive memories of Jacurutu. Alia would have her hands full. As for Ghanima . . . Silently to himself, Leto mouthed the words which would restore her memory. Time for that later... if they survived this terrible mixing of threads.\nThe Golden Path lured him out there on the desert, almost a physical thing which he could see with his open eyes. And he thought how it was: as animals must move across the land, their existence dependent upon that movement, the soul of humankind, blocked for eons, needed a track upon which it could move.\nHe thought of his father then, telling himself: “Soon we'll dispute as man to man, and only one vision will emerge.”\nLimits of survival are set by climate, those long drifts of change which a generation may fail to notice. And it is the extremes of climate which set the pattern. Lonely, finite humans may observe climatic provinces, fluctuations of annual weather and, occasionally may observe such things as “This is a colder year than I’ve ever known.” Such things are sensible. But humans are seldom alerted to the shifting average through a great span of years. And it is precisely in this alerting that humans learn how to survive on any planet. They must learn climate.\n—ARRAKIS, THE TRANSFORMATION AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\nlia sat cross-legged on her bed, trying to compose\nherself by reciting the Litany Against Fear, but chuckling derision echoed in her skull to block every effort. She could hear the voice; it controlled her ears, her mind.\n“What nonsense is this? What have you to fear?”\nThe muscles of her calves twitched as her feet tried to make running motions. There was nowhere to run.\nShe wore only a golden gown of the sheerest Palian silk and it revealed the plumpness which had begun to bulge her body. The Hour of Assassins had just passed; dawn was near. Reports covering the past three months lay before her on the red coverlet. She could hear the humming of the air conditioner and a small breeze stirred the labels on the shigawire spools.\nAides had awakened her fearfully two hours earlier, bringing news of the latest outrage, and Alia had called for the report spools, seeking an intelligible pattern.\nShe gave up on the Litany.\nThese attacks had to be the work of rebels. Obviously. More and more of them turned against Muad’Dib’s religion.\n“And what’s wrong with that?” the derisive voice asked within her.\nAlia shook her head savagely. Namri had failed her. She’d been a fool to trust such a dangerous double instrument. Her aides whispered that Stilgar was to blame, that he was a secret rebel. And what had become of Halleck? Gone to ground among his smuggler friends? Possibly.\nShe picked up one of the report spools. And Muriz! The man was hysterical. That was the only possible explanation. Otherwise she’d have to believe in miracles. No human, let alone a child (even a child such as Leto) could leap from the butte at Shuloch and survive to flee across the desert in leaps that took him from dunecrest to dunecrest.\nAlia felt the coldness of the shigawire under her hand. Where was Leto, then? Ghanima refused to believe him other than dead. A Truthsayer had confirmed her story: Leto Slain by a Laza tiger. Then who was the child reported by\nNamri and Muriz?\nShe shuddered.\nForty qanats had been breached, their waters loosed into the sand. The loyal Fremen and even the rebels, superstitious louts, all! Her reports were flooded with stories of mysterious occurrences. Sandtrout leaped into qanats and shattered to become hosts of small replicas. Worms deliberately drowned themselves. Blood dripped from Second Moon and fell to Arrakis, where it stirred up great storms. And the storm frequency was increasing!\nShe thought of Duncan incommunicado at Tabr, fretting under the restraints she’d exacted from Stilgar. He and lrulan talked of little else than the rea/ meaning behind these omens. Fools! Even her spies betrayed the influence of these outrageous stories!\nWhy did Ghanima insist on her story of the Laza tiger?\nAlia sighed. Only one of the reports on the shigawire spools reassured her. Farad’n had sent a contingent of his household guard “to help you in troubles and to prepare the\nway for the Official Rite of Betrothal.” Alia smiled to herself and shared the chuckle which rumbled in her skull. That plan, at least, remained intact. Logical explanations would be found to dispel all of this other superstitious nonsense.\nMeanwhile she’d use Farad’n’s men to help close down Shuloch and to arrest the known dissidents, especially among the Naibs. She debated moving against Stilgar, but the inner voice cautioned against this.\n“Not yet.”\n“My mother and the Sisterhood still have some plan of their own,” Alia whispered. “Why is she training Farad’n?”\n“Perhaps he excites her,” the Old Baron said.\n“Not that cold one.”\n“You're not thinking of asking Farad’n to return her?”\n“I know the dangers in that!”\n“Good. Meanwhile, that young aide Zia recently brought in. | believe his name’s Agarves—Buer Agarves. If you’d invite him here tonight...”\n“No!”\n“Alia...”\n“It’s almost dawn, you insatiable old fool! There’s a Military Council meeting this morning, the Priests will have\n“Don’t trust them, darling Alia.”\n“Of course not!”\n“Very well. Now, this Buer Agarves.. .”\n“I said no!”\nThe Old Baron remained silent within her, but she began to feel a headache. A slow pain crept upward from her left cheek into her skull. Once he’d sent her raging down the corridors with this trick. Now, she resolved to resist him.\n“If you persist, l'Il take a sedative,” she said.\nHe could see she meant it. The headache began to recede.\n“Very well.” Petulant. “Another time, then.”\n“Another time,” she agreed.\nThou didst divide the sand by thy strength; Thou breakest the heads of the dragons in the desert. Yea, | behold thee as a beast coming up from the dunes; thou hast the two horns of the lamb, but thou speakest as the dragon.\n—REVISED ORANGE CATHOLIC BIBLE ARRAN II:4\nt was the immutable prophecy, the threads become rope,\na thing Leto now seemed to have known all of his life.
