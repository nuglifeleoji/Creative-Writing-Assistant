“这说法不对的。他在荒山上种，又没有占  耕地，再说，他当初种的时候你们也没有说什  么。”\n     “是啊，后来县里还给了他一个造林模范  呢。本来村里是想过几年再收林子的，猪养肥了  再杀嘛，可南拉村的人等不及来砍了，我们不动  手也没份儿了。”\n     “你们马上停下来！我要到政府部门去反映  这事！\n     “不用了，”村长点上一支烟，指指远方正  在装树木的一辆大货车，“看那车，就是县林业  局副局长的，还有镇派出所什么的，木头数他们拉走得最多！我说过，这林子没名没份的，不受保护，你到哪儿找都没用；再说，叶同志，你不是大学教授吗？这和你有嘛关系？”\n     那两间土坯房还是原样，但伊文斯不在里面，叶文洁在树林里找到了他，他正拿着一把斧子一心一意地修剪树枝，显然已经干了很久，一副疲惫不堪的样子。\n     “不管有没有意义，我不能停下来，停下来我会崩溃的。”伊文斯说，熟练地砍下一条歪枝。\n     “我们一起去县里找政府，不行就去省城，总会有人制止他们的。”叶文洁关切地看着他。\n     伊文斯停下来，用很惊奇的目光看着叶文洁，夕阳透过重重林木照进来，在他的眸子中闪亮。‘’叶，你真的以为我是为了这片树林？”他笑着摇摇头，扔下了手中的斧子，靠着一棵树坐了下来，“我现在要想制止他们，轻而易举。”他把一只空的工具袋放到地上，示意叶文洁坐下，接着说，“我刚从美国回来，父亲在两个月前去世，我继承了他的大部分遗产。哥哥和姐姐只各得了五百万。这让我很意外，真的没想到他最后能对我这样，也许，他在内心深处还是看重我的，或者，看重我的理想。不把不动产算在内，知道我现在能支配的钱有多少吗？大约四十五亿美元。我可以轻而易举地让他们停止砍树，然后让他们种树，让我们目力所及的黄土山都被这样的速生林覆盖，很容易，但有什么意义呢？你看到的一切可以归结为贫穷，但富裕的国家又怎么样？他们营造自己的优美环境，却把重污染工业向穷国转移，你可能知道，美国政府刚刚拒绝签署京都议定书……整个人类本质上都一样，只要文明像这样发展，我想拯救的这种燕子，还有其他的燕子，迟早都会灭绝，只是时间问题。”\n
