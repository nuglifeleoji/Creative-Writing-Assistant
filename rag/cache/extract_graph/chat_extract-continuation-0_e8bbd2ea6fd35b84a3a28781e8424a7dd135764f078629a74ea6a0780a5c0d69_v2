He made her tie off the knot with her free hand, holding one end of the bandage in her teeth.\n“Now let’s look at the leg,” he said.\nShe twisted around to present the other wound. It was not as bad: two shallow claw cuts along the calf. They had bled\nfreely into the stillsuit, however. He cleaned it up as best he could, bound the wound beneath the stillsuit. He sealed the suit over the bandage.\n“I got sand in it,” he said. “Have it treated as soon as you get back.”\n“Sand in our wounds,” she said. “That’s an old story for Fremen.”\nHe managed a smile, sat back.\nGhanima took a deep breath. “We've pulled it off.”\n“Not yet.”\nShe swallowed, fighting to recover from the aftermath of shock. Her face appeared pale in the light of the glowglobe. And she thought: Yes, we must move fast now. Whoever controlled those tigers could be out there right now.\nLeto, staring at his sister, felt a sudden wrenching sense of loss. It was a deep pain which shot through his breast. He and Ghanima must separate now. For all of those years since birth they had been as one person. But their plan demanded now that they undergo a metamorphosis, going their separate ways into uniqueness where the sharing of daily experiences would never again unite them as they once had been united.\nHe retreated into the necessarily mundane. “Here’s my Fremkit. | took the bandages from it. Someone may look.”\n“Yes.” She exchanged kits with him.\n“Someone out there has a transmitter for those cats,” he said. “Most likely he'll be waiting near the qanat to make certain of us.”\nShe touched her maula pistol where it sat atop the Fremkit, picked it up and thrust it into the sash beneath her robe. “My robe’s torn.”\n“Yes.”\n“Searchers may get here soon,” he said. “They may have a traitor among them. Best you slip back alone. Get Harrah to hide you.”\n“PIL... Ul start the search for the traitor as soon as | get back,” she said. She peered into her brother’s face, sharing his painful knowledge that from this point on they would accumulate a store of differences. Never again would they be as one, sharing knowledge which no one else could understand.\n“I'll go to Jacurutu,” he said.\n“Fondak,” she said.\nHe nodded his agreement. Jacurutu/Fondak—they had to be the same place. It was the only way the legendary place could have been hidden. Smugglers had done it, of course. How easy for them to convert one label into another, acting under the cover of the unspoken convention by which they were allowed to exist. The ruling family of a planet must always have a back door for escape in extremis. And a small Share in smuggling profits kept the channels open. In Fondak/Jacurutu, the smugglers had taken over a completely operative sietch untroubled by a resident population. And they had hidden Jacurutu right out in the open, secure in the taboo which kept Fremen from it.\n“No Fremen will think to search for me in such a place,” he said. “They'll inquire among the smugglers, of course, but...”\n“We'll do as we agreed,” she said. “It’s just...”\n“I know.” Hearing his own voice, Leto realized they were drawing out these last moments of sameness. A wry grin touched his mouth, adding years to his appearance. Ghanima realized she was seeing him through a veil of time, looking at an older Leto. Tears burned her eyes.\n“You needn’t give water to the dead just yet,” he said, brushing a finger against the dampness on her cheeks. “IIl go out far enough that no one will hear, and l'Il calla worm.” He indicated the collapsed Maker hooks strapped to the outside of his Fremkit. “l'II be at Jacurutu before dawn two days from now.”\n“Ride swiftly, my old friend,” she whispered.\n“I’ll come back to you, my only friend,” he said. “Remember to be careful at the qanat.”\n“Choose a good worm,” she said, giving him the Fremen words of parting. Her left hand extinguished the glowglobe, and the nightseal rustled as she pulled it aside, folded it and tucked it into her kit. She felt him go, hearing only the softest of sounds quickly fading into silence as he crept down the rocks into the desert.\nGhanima steeled herself then for what she had to do. Leto must be dead to her. She had to make herself believe it. There could be no Jacurutu in her mind, no brother out there seeking a place lost in Fremen mythology. From this point onward she could not think of Leto as alive. She must condition herself to react out of a total belief that her brother was dead, killed here by Laza tigers. Not many humans could fool a Truthsayer, but she knew that she could do it... might have to do it. The multi-lives she and Leto shared had taught them the way: a hypnotic process old in Sheba’s time, although she might be the only human alive who could recall Sheba as a reality. The deep compulsions had been designed with care and, for a long time after Leto had gone, Ghanima reworked her self- awareness, building the lonely sister, the surviving twin, until it was a believable totality. As she did this, she found the inner world becoming silent, blanked away from intrusion into her consciousness. It was a side effect she had not expected.\nIf only Leto could have lived to learn this, she thought, and she did not find the thought a paradox. Standing, she peered down at the desert where the tiger had taken Leto. There was a sound growing in the sand out there, a familiar sound to Fremen: the passage of a worm. Rare as they had become in these parts, a worm still came. Perhaps the first cat’s death throes. ... Yes, Leto had killed one cat before the other one got him. It was oddly symbolic that a worm should come. So deep was her compulsion that she saw\nthree dark spots far down on the sand: the two tigers and Leto. Then the worm came and there was only sand with its surface broken into new waves by the passage of Shai- Hulud. It had not been a very large worm... but large enough. And her compulsion did not permit her to see a Small figure riding on the ringed back.\nFighting her grief, Ghanima sealed her Fremkit, crept cautiously from her hiding place. Hand on her maula pistol, she scanned the area. No sign of a human with a transmitter. She worked her way up the rocks and across to the far side, creeping through moonshadows, waiting and waiting to be sure no assassin lurked in her path.\nAcross the open space she could see torches at Tabr, the wavering activity of a search. A dark patch moved across the sand toward The Attendant. She chose her path to run far to the north of the approaching party, went down to the sand and moved into the dune shadows. Careful to make her steps fall in a broken rhythm which would not attract a worm, she set out into the lonely distance which separated Tabr from the place where Leto had died. She would have to be careful at the qanat, she knew. Nothing must prevent her from telling how her brother had perished saving her from the tigers.\nGovernments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class—whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.\n—POLITICS AS REPEAT PHENOMENON: BENE GESSERIT TRAINING MANUAL\nfd hy does he make us this offer?” Farad’n asked. “That’s most essential.”\nHe and the Bashar Tyekanik stood in the lounge of Farad’n’s private quarters. Wensicia sat at one side on a low blue divan, almost as audience rather than participant. She knew her position and resented it, but Farad’n had undergone a terrifying change since that morning when she'd revealed their plots to him.\nIt was late afternoon at Corrino Castle and the low light accented the quiet comfort of this lounge—a room lined with actual books reproduced in plastino, with shelves revealing a horde of player spools, data blocks, shigawire reels, mnemonic amplifiers. There were signs all around that this room was much used—worn places on the books, bright metal on the amplifiers, frayed corners on the data blocks. There was only the one divan, but many chairs—all of them sensiform floaters designed for unobtrusive comfort.\nFarad’n stood with his back to a window. He wore a plain Sardaukar uniform in grey and black with only the golden lion-claw symbols on the wings of his collar as decoration. He had chosen to receive the Bashar and his mother in this room, hoping to create an atmosphere of more relaxed communication than could be achieved in a more formal\nsetting. But Tyekanik’s constant “My Lord this” and “My Lady that” kept them at a distance.\n“My Lord, | don’t think he’d make this offer were he unable to deliver,” Tyekanik said.\n“Of course not!” Wensicia intruded.\nFarad’n merely glanced at his mother to silence her, asked: “We've put no pressure on Idaho, made no attempt to seek delivery on The Preacher’s promise?”\n“None,” Tyekanik said.\n“Then why does Duncan Idaho, noted all of his life for his fanatic loyalty to the Atreides, offer now to deliver the Lady Jessica into our hands?”\n“These rumors of trouble on Arrakis .. .” Wensicia ventured.\n“Unconfirmed,” Farad’n said. “Is it possible that The Preacher has precipitated this?”\n“Possible,” Tyekanik said, “but I fail to see a motive.”\n“He speaks of seeking asylum for her,” Farad’n said. “That might follow if those rumors...”\n“Precisely,” his mother said.\n“Or it could be a ruse of some sort,” Tyekanik said.\n“We can make several assumptions and explore them,” Farad’n said. “What if Idaho has fallen into disfavor with his Lady Alia?”\n“That might explain matters,” Wensicia said, “but he—”\n“No word yet from the smugglers?” Farad’n interrupted. “Why can’t we—”\n“Transmission is always slow in this season,” Tyekanik said, “and the needs of security .. .”\n“Yes, of course, but still...” Farad’n shook his head. “I don’t like our assumption.”\n“Don’t be too quick to abandon it,” Wensicia said. “All of those stories about Alia and that Priest, whatever his name Soe ete “Javid,” Farad’n said. “But the man’s obviously—”\n“He’s been a valuable source of information for us,” Wensicia said.\n“I was about to say that he’s obviously a double agent,” Farad’n said. “How could he indict himself in this? He’s not to be trusted.
