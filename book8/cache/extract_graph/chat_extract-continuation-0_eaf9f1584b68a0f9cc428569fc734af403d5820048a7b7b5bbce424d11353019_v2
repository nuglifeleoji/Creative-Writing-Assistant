娜娜呆呆的坐在自己的房间之中。发呆才是她的日常。也是打发时间最好的办法。而绝大多数的时候，她发呆时大脑都是一片空白。没有回忆，没有思考，就是那么简单的发呆。\n\n    可今天似乎有了一些变化，当她同样陷入发呆失神状态时，脑海中却始终浮现着那双明亮的大眼睛，还有他那悦耳的童音。\n\n    他的小脸蛋儿上还带着些许婴儿肥，娜娜抬了抬手，似是想要触摸，心中有种说不出的感觉。\n\n    这就是书上说的想念吗？可是，为什么我会对一个初次见面的孩子产生这样的情绪？\n\n    娜娜自己也有些不明白，可她就是觉得，自己和那个孩子特别的有缘分。哪怕是云琰，在一起这么久，她都有些排斥她的亲近。可那个孩子挽住她的长发时，她却有种特别温馨的感觉。似乎就是想要把他搂入自己怀中，抱抱他。\n\n    蓝轩宇吗？可是，他现在在哪里呢？\n\n    娜娜缓缓闭上了双眼，不知道为什么，她只觉得自己的思感似乎在向外释放。她很快看到了外面的世界。\n\n    有了联邦身份的她，住在科学院的家属楼之中，自己有一个一室一厅的房子，这里也没有科学院内部那么多的防护措施。她只觉得自己的意识不断的向外延伸，思感也向外扩张。\n\n    那边是家属区的运动场，远处的银白色半球形建筑就是她住了六年的科学院了。可是，为什么我能看的那么清楚？\n\n    娜娜有些茫然的在心中感应着，很快，她有看到了熟悉的人。那是一位位熟悉的科学家，他们应该是刚结束工作，从科学院之中走出来。\n\n    这是感知吗？我可以感知的这么远吗？我究竟是谁啊？不知道，能不能感受到那个孩子所在的地方……\n\n    蓝轩宇一家的旅行继续，南澄安排的行程相当紧凑，第二天开始，他们就忙碌于走马观花似的旅行。走了天斗城一些重要景点，又前往了其他城市游览。期间也看到一些与天罗星不同的东西，但更多的却是类似。毕竟，绝大多数的一切，都是星际移民之后建设的。而天罗星在建设时，本身就借鉴了许多天斗星的经验。\n\n    “美好的时光过得总是很快，还有一天咱们就要回家了？宝贝儿子，这次旅行你还满意吗？”南澄笑眯眯的向蓝轩宇问道。\n\n    “挺好的，谢谢妈妈。”蓝轩宇笑眯眯的说道，他最满意的其实是旅行箱里的几个小玩具。其中，最让他喜欢的是一个模型。\n\n    那是一个高约三十厘米的手办，是一名身穿金色甲胄的男子。蓝潇告诉他，那可不是普通的\n######################\nOutput:",
