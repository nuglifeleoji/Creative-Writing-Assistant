礼引雍、凉诸郡人马到。懿即令孙礼约会郭淮去袭剑阁。却说孔明在卤城相拒日久，不见魏兵出战，乃唤姜维、马岱入城听令曰：“今魏兵守住山险，不与我战：一者料吾麦尽无粮；二者令兵去袭剑阁，断吾粮道也。汝二人各引一万军先去守住险要，魏兵见有准备，自然退去。”二人引兵去了。\n\n    长史杨仪入帐告曰：“向者丞相令大兵一百日一换，今已限足，汉中兵已出川口，前路公文已到，只待会兵交换：现存八万军，内四万该与换班。”孔明曰：“既有令，便教速行。”众军闻知，各各收拾起程。忽报孙礼引雍、凉人马二十万来助战，去袭剑阁，司马懿自引兵来攻卤城了。蜀兵无不惊骇。\n\n    杨仪入告孔明曰：“魏兵来得甚急，丞相可将换班军且留下退敌，待新来兵到，然后换之。”孔明曰：“不可。吾用兵命将，以信为本；既有令在先，岂可失信？且蜀兵应去者，皆准备归计，其父母妻子倚扉而望；吾今便有大难，决不留他。”即传令教应去之兵，当日便行。众军闻之，皆大呼曰：“丞相如此施恩于众，我等愿且不回，各舍一命，大杀魏兵，以报丞相！”孔明曰：“尔等该还家，岂可复留于此？”众军皆要出战，不愿回家。孔明曰：“汝等既要与我出战，可出城安营，待魏兵到，莫待他息喘，便急攻之：此以逸待劳之法也。”众兵领命，各执兵器，欢喜出城，列阵而待。却说西凉人马倍道而来，走的人马困乏；方欲下营歇息，被蜀兵一拥而进，人人奋勇，将锐兵骁，雍、凉兵抵敌不住，望后便退。蜀兵奋力追杀，杀得那雍、凉兵尸横遍野，血流成渠。孔明出城，收聚得胜之兵，入城赏劳。忽报永安李严有书告急。孔明大惊，拆封视之。书云：“近闻东吴令人入洛阳，与魏连和；魏令吴取蜀，幸吴尚未起兵。今严探知消息，伏望丞相，早作良图。”孔明览毕，甚是惊疑，乃聚诸将曰：“若东吴兴兵寇蜀，吾须索速回也。”即传令，教祁山大寨人马，且退回西川：“司马懿知吾屯军在此，必不敢追赶。”于是王平、张嶷、吴班、吴懿，分兵两骆，徐徐退入西川去了。张郃见蜀兵退去，恐有计策，不敢来追，乃引兵往见司马懿曰：“今蜀兵退去，不知何意？”懿曰：“孔明诡计极多，不可轻动\n######################\nOutput:",
