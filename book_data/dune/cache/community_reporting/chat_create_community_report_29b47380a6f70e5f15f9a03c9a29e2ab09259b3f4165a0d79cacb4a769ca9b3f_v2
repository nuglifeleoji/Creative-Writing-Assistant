The shed is connected to a small room through a boarded-up window, indicating a level of isolation and perhaps a sense of secrecy in the narrator's activities.\n\nWithin this shed, the narrator finds a place to stay and observe the villagers and their behaviors. This observation suggests that the shed is not merely a physical shelter but also a vantage point for the narrator to study the dynamics of the surrounding community. The combination of its protective qualities and its role as an observational space highlights the significance of the \"\"棚子\"\" in the narrator's experience, serving both as a refuge and a strategic location for understanding the lives of others.\",9\r\n431,农舍,\"The \"\"农舍\"\" (farmhouse) serves as a central location in the narrative, embodying various themes and events that shape the story. It is depicted as a clean and tidy structure, contrasting sharply with the adjacent grass shed, which is in poor condition. This juxtaposition highlights the farmhouse's role as a place of refuge and community amidst the surrounding rural landscape, characterized by quaint structures nestled among trees in the Alpine region.\n\nSignificant events unfold at the farmhouse, where the narrator interacts with an elderly man and young people, creating a sense of connection and shared experience. It is also the place where the narrator spends the night while searching for a character named William, indicating its importance as a temporary haven. The farmhouse is not only a physical space but also a symbol of emotional turmoil; it is the site where the narrator contemplates committing arson, representing deep-seated anger and despair.\n\nThe farmhouse is associated with the character 德拉赛, who resides there, providing a resting place that underscores the theme of sanctuary. Additionally, it serves as a gathering point for neighbors, where characters come together to experience a series of emotional conflicts, further emphasizing its role as a focal point for interpersonal relationships and community dynamics.\n\nHowever, the narrative takes a darker turn when the farmhouse is engulfed in flames, symbolizing destruction and despair. This event marks a significant transformation of the space from a place of refuge to one of loss, encapsulating the emotional weight carried by the characters and the story itself.\n\nOverall, the \"\"农舍\"\" is a multifaceted entity within the narrative, representing both the beauty of rural life and the complexities of human emotions.

This act of hiding in the forest symbolizes a deeper sense of uncertainty and the search for safety amidst chaos. The forest is not merely a backdrop; it represents a connection to nature and the life it sustains, as highlighted by Adam's first encounter with this landscape, which embodies the beauty and vitality of the natural world.\n\nAdditionally, the forest serves practical purposes for the characters within the story.
