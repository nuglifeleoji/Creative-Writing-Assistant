渭水之西。细作报入洛阳。时魏主曹睿太和元年，升殿设朝。近臣奏曰：“夏侯驸马已失三郡，逃窜羌中去了。今蜀兵已到祁山，前军临渭水之西，乞早发兵破敌。”睿大惊，乃问群臣曰：“谁可为朕退蜀兵耶？”司徒王朗出班奏曰：“臣观先帝每用大将军曹真，所到必克；今陛下何不拜为大都督，以退蜀兵？”睿准奏，乃宣曹真曰：“先帝托孤与卿，今蜀兵入寇中原，卿安忍坐视乎？”真奏曰：“臣才疏智浅，不称其职。”王朗曰：“将军乃社稷之臣，不可固辞。老臣虽驽钝，愿随将军一往。”真又奏曰：“臣受大恩，安敢推辞？但乞一人为副将。”睿曰：“卿自举之。”真乃保太原阳曲人，姓郭，名淮，字伯济，官封射亭侯，领雍州刺史。睿从之，遂拜曹真为大都督，赐节钺；命郭淮为副都督，王朗为军师。朗时年已七十六岁矣。选拨东西二京军马二十万与曹真。真命宗弟曹遵为先锋，又命荡寇将军朱赞为副先锋。当年十一月出师，魏主曹睿亲自送出西门之外方回。曹真领大军来到长安，过渭河之西下寨。真与王朗、郭淮共议退兵之策。朗曰：“来日可严整队伍，大展旌旗。老夫自出，只用一席话，管教诸葛亮拱手而降，蜀兵不战自退。”真大喜，是夜传令：来日四更造饭，平明务要队伍整齐，人马威仪，旌旗鼓角，各按次序。当时使人先下战书。次日，两军相迎，列成阵势于祁山之前。蜀军见魏兵甚是雄壮，与夏侯楙大不相同。三军鼓角已罢，司徒王朗乘马而出。上首乃都督曹真，下首乃副都督郭淮；两个先锋压住阵角。探子马出军前，大叫曰：“请对阵主将答话！”只见蜀兵门旗开处，关兴、张苞分左右而出，立马于两边；次后一队队骁将分列；门旗影下，中央一辆四轮车，孔明端坐车中，纶巾羽扇，素衣皂绦，飘然而出。孔明举目见魏阵前三个麾盖，旗上大书姓名：中央白髯老者，乃军师、司徒王朗。孔明暗忖曰：“王朗必下说词，吾当随机应之。”遂教推车出阵外，令护军小校传曰：“汉丞相与司徒会话。”王朗纵马而出。孔明于车上拱手，朗在马上欠身答礼。朗曰：“久闻公之大名，今幸一会。公既知天命、识时务，何故兴无名之兵？”孔明曰：“吾奉诏讨贼，何谓无名？”朗曰：“天数有变，神\n######################\nOutput:",
