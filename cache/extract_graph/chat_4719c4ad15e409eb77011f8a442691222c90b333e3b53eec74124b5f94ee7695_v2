The cars went swishing past on their\nsuspensors, the dirty slush flying from under their fanskirts and peppering the bushes along the road. Burzmali held her down beside him in the snow until he was sure the cars were out of sight and sound. Not that anyone riding in them could hear much except their own whirling passage.\nThey had been walking for two hours before Burzmali stopped and took stock of the way ahead. Their destination was a perimeter community that had been described to them as “completely safe.” Lucilla knew better. No place on Gammu was completely safe.\nYellow lights cast an undershot glow on the clouds ahead of them, marking the location of the community. Their slushy progress took them through a tunnel under the perimeter road and up a low hill planted to some sort of orchard. The limbs were stark in the dim light.\nLucilla glanced upward. The clouds were thinning. Gammu had many small moons—fortress no-ships. Some of them had been placed by Teg but she glimpsed lines of new ones sharing the guardian role. They appeared to be about four times the size of the brightest stars and they often traveled together, which made their reflected light useful but erratic because they moved fast—up across the sky and below the horizon in only a few hours. She glimpsed a string of six such moons through a break in the clouds, wondering if they were part of Teg’s defense system.\nMomentarily, she reflected on the inherent weakness of the siege mentality that such defenses represented. Teg had been right about them. Mobility was the key to military success but she doubted that he had meant mobility on foot.\nThere were no easy hiding places on the snow-whitened Slope and Lucilla felt Burzmali’s nervousness. What could they do here if someone came? A snow-covered depression led down from their position to the left, angling toward the community. It was not a road but she thought it might be a path.\n“Down this way,” Burzmali said, leading them into the depression.\nThe snow came up to their calves.\n“| hope these people are trustworthy,” she said.\n“They hate the Honored Matres,” he said. “That’s enough for me.”\n“The ghola had better be there!” She held back an even more angry response but could not keep herself from adding: “Their hatred isn’t enough for me.”\nIt was better to expect the worst, she thought.\nShe had come to a reassuring thought about Burzmali, though. He was like Teg. Neither of them pursued a course that would lead them into a dead end—not if they could help it. She suspected there were support forces concealed in the bushes around them even now.\nThe snow-covered trail ended in a paved pathway, gently curved inward from the edges and kept free of snow by a melt system. There was a trickle of dampness in the center. Lucilla was several steps onto this path before she recognized what it must be—a magchute. It was an ancient magnetic transport base that once had carried goods or raw materials to a pre-Scattering factory.\n“It gets steeper here,” Burzmali warned her. “They’ve carved steps in it but watch it. They’re not very deep.”\nThey came presently to the end of the magchute. It stopped at a decrepit wall—local brick atop a plasteel foundation. The faint light of stars in a clearing sky revealed crude workmanship in the bricks—typical Famine-Times construction. The wall was a mass of vines and mottled fungus. The growth did little to conceal the cracked courses of the bricks and the crude efforts to fill chinks with mortar. A single row of narrow windows looked down onto the place where the magchute debouched into a mass of bushes and weeds. Three of the windows glowed electric blue with some inner activity that was accompanied by faint crackling sounds.\n“This was a factory in the old days,” Burzmali said.\n“I have eyes and a memory,” Lucilla snapped. Did this grunting male think her completely devoid of intelligence?\nSomething creaked dismally off to their left. A patch of sod and weeds lifted atop a cellar door accompanied by an upward glow of brilliant yellow light.\n“Quick!” Burzmali led her at a swift run across thick vegetation and down a flight of steps exposed by the lifting door. The door creaked closed behind them in a grumbling of machinery.\nLucilla found herself in a large space with a low ceiling. Light came from long lines of modern glowglobes strung along massive plasteel girders overhead. The floor was swept clean but showed scratches and indentations of activity, the locations no doubt of bygone machinery. She glimpsed movement far off across the open space. A young woman in a version of Lucilla’s dragon robe trotted toward them.\nLucilla sniffed. There was a stink of acid in the room and undertones of something foul.\n“This was a Harkonnen factory,” Burzmali said. “| wonder what they made here?”\nThe young woman stopped in front of Lucilla. She had a willowy figure, elegant in shape and motion under the clinging robe. A subcutaneous glow came from her face. It spoke of exercise and good health. The green eyes, though, were hard and chilling in the way they measured everything they saw.\n“So they sent more than one of us to watch this place,” she said.\nLucilla put out a restraining hand as Burzmali started to respond. This woman was not what she seemed. No more than I am! Lucilla chose her words carefully. “We always know each other, it seems.”\nThe young woman smiled. “I watched your approach. | could not believe my eyes.” She swept a sneering glance\nacross Burzmali. “This was supposed to be a customer?”\n“And guide,” Lucilla said. She noted the puzzlement on Burzmali’s face and prayed he would not ask the wrong question. This young woman was danger!\n“Weren't we expected?” Burzmali asked.\n“Ahhhh, it speaks,” the young woman said, laughing. Her laugh was as cold as her eyes.\n“| prefer that you do not refer to me as ‘it,’” Burzmali said.\n“I call Gammu scum anything | wish,” the young woman said. “Don’t speak to me of your preferences!”\n“What did you call me?” Burzmali was tired and his anger came boiling up at this unexpected attack.\n“I call you anything | choose, scum!”\nBurzmali had suffered enough. Before Lucilla could stop him, he uttered a low growl and aimed a heavy slap at the young woman.\nThe blow did not land.\nLucilla watched in fascination as the woman dropped under the attack, caught Burzmali’s sleeve as one might catch a bit of fabric blowing in the wind and, in a blindingly fast pirouette whose speed almost hid its delicacy, sent Burzmali skidding across the floor. The woman dropped to a half crouch on one foot, the other prepared to kick.\n“I shall kill him now,” she said.\nLucilla, not Knowing what might happen next, folded her body sideways, barely avoiding the woman’s suddenly outthrust foot, and countered with a standard Bene Gesserit sabard that dumped the young woman on her back doubled up where the blow had caught her in the abdomen.\n“A suggestion that you kill my guide is uncalled for, whatever your name is,” Lucilla said.\nThe young woman gasped for breath, then, panting between words: “I am called Murbella, Great Honored Matre. You shame me by defeating me with such a slow attack. Why do you do that?”\n“You needed a lesson,” Lucilla said.\n“Lam only newly robed, Great Honored Matre. Please forgive me. | thank you for the splendid lesson and will thank you every time | employ your response, which | now commit to memory.” She bowed her head, then leaped lightly to her feet, an impish grin on her face.\nIn her coldest voice, Lucilla asked: “Do you know who | am?” Out of the corners of her eyes, she saw Burzmali regain his feet with painful slowness. He remained at one side, watching the women, but anger burned his face.\n“From your ability to teach me that lesson, | see that you are who you are, Great Honored Matre. Am | forgiven?” The impish grin had vanished from Murbella’s face. She stood with head bowed.\n“You are forgiven. Is there a no-ship coming?”\n“So they say here. We are prepared for it.” Murbella glanced at Burzmali.\n“He is still useful to me and it is required that he accompany me,” Lucilla said.\n“Very good, Great Honored Matre. Does your forgiveness include your name?”\n“No!”\nMurbella sighed. “We have captured the ghola,” she said. “He came as a Tleilaxu from the south. | was just about to bed him when you arrived.”\nBurzmali hobbled toward them. Lucilla saw that he had recognized the danger. This “completely safe” place had been infested by enemies! But the enemies still knew very little.\n“The ghola was not injured?” Burzmali asked.\n“It still soeaks,” Murbella said. “How odd.”\n“You will not bed the ghola,” Lucilla said. “That one is my special charge!”\n“Fair game, Great Honored Matre. And | marked him first. He is already partly subdued.”\nShe laughed once more, with a callous abandonment that shocked Lucilla. “This way. There is a place where you can watch.”\nMay you die on Caladan!\n—ANCIENT DRINKING TOAST\nD uncan tried to remember where he was. He knew Tormsa was dead. Blood had spurted from Tormsa’s eyes. Yes, he remembered that clearly. They had entered a dark building and light had flared abruptly all around them. Duncan felt an ache in the back of his head. A blow? He tried to move and his muscles refused to obey.\nHe remembered sitting at the edge of a wide lawn. There was some kind of bowling game in progress— eccentric balls that bounced and darted with no apparent design. The players were young men in a common costume of... Giedi Prime!\n“They are practicing to be old men,” he said. He remembered saying that.\nHis companion, a young woman, looked at him blankly.\n“Only old men should play these outdoor games,” he said.\n“Oh?”\nIt was an unanswerable question. She put him down with only the simplest of verbal gestures.\nAnd betrayed me the next instant to the Harkonnens!\nSo that was a pre-ghola memory.\nGhola!\nHe remembered the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu. The library: holophotos and triphotos of the Atreides Duke, Leto |. Teg’s resemblance was not an accident: a bit taller but otherwise it was all there—that long, thin face with its high- bridged nose, the renowned Atreides charisma...\nTeg!\nHe remembered the old Bashar’s last gallant stand in the Gammu night.\nWhere am I?\nTormsa had brought him here. They had been moving along an overgrown track on the outskirts of Ysai. Barony. It started to snow before they were two hundred meters up the track. Wet snow that clung to them. Cold, miserable snow that set their teeth chattering within a minute. They paused to bring up their hoods and close the insulated jackets. That was better. But it would be night soon. Much colder.\n“There is a shelter of sorts up ahead,” Tormsa said. “We will wait there for the night.”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4719c4ad15e409eb77011f8a442691222c90b333e3b53eec74124b5f94ee7695_v2"}
