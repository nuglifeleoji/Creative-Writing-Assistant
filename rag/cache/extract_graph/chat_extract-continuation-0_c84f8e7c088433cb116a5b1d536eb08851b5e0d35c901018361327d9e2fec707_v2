It was to be designed as a self-improving thing which would seek out life and reduce that life to its inorganic matter.”\n“I have not heard of this thing, Lord.”\n“I know that. The Ixians do not recognize that machine- makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine. This is ultimate sterility. Machines always fail... given time. And when these machines failed there would be nothing left, no life at all.”\n“Sometimes | think they are mad,” she said.\n“Anteac’s opinion. That is the immediate problem. The Ixians are now engaged in an endeavor which they are concealing.”\n“Even from you?”\n“Even from me. | am sending the Reverend Mother Anteac to investigate for me. To help her, | want you to tell her everything you can about the place where you spent your childhood. Omit no detail, no matter how small. Anteac will help you remember. We want every sound, every smell, the shapes and names of visitors, the colors and even the tinglings of your skin. The slightest thing may be vital.”\n“You think it is the place of concealment?”\n“I know it is.”\n“And you think they are making this weapon in...”\n“No, but this will be our excuse for investigating the place where you were born.”\nShe opened her mouth and gradually formed a smile, then: “My Lord is devious. | will soeak to the Reverend Mother immediately.” Hwi started to rise, but he stopped her with a gesture.\n“We must not give the appearance of haste,” he said.\nShe sank back onto the cushion.\n“Each of us is different in the way of Moneo’s observation,” he said. “Genesis does not stop. Your god continues creating you.”\n“What will Anteac find? You know, don’t you?”\n“Let us say that | have a strong conviction. Now, you have not once mentioned the subject which | broached earlier. Have you no questions?”\n“You will provide the answers as | require them.” It was a statement full of such trust that it stopped Leto’s voice. He could only look at her, realizing how extraordinary was this accomplishment of the Ixians—this human. Hwi remained precisely true to the dictates of her personally chosen morality. She was comely, warm and honest and possessed of an emphatic sense which forced her to share every anguish in those with whom she identified. He could imagine the dismay of her Bene Gesserit teachers when confronted by this immovable core of self-honesty. The teachers obviously had been reduced to adding a touch here, an ability there, everything strengthening that power which prevented her from becoming a Bene Gesserit. How that must have rankled!\n“Lord,” she said, “I would know the motives which forced you to choose your life.”\n“First, you must understand what it is like to see our future.”\n“With your help, | will try.”\n“Nothing is ever separated from its source,” he said. “Seeing futures is a vision of a continuum in which all things take shape like bubbles forming beneath a waterfall. You see them and then they vanish into the stream. If the stream ends, it is as though the bubbles never were. That stream is my Golden Path and | saw it end.”\n“Your choice”—she gestured at his body—“changed that?”\n“It is changing. The change comes not only from the manner of my life but from the manner of my death.”\n“You know how you will die?”\n“Not how. | know only the Golden Path in which it will occur.”\n“Lord, | donot...”\n“It is difficult to understand, | know. | will die four deaths —the death of the flesh, the death of the soul, the death of the myth and the death of reason. And all of these deaths contain the seed of resurrection.”\n“You will return from...”\n“The seeds will return.”\n“When you are gone, what will happen to your religion?”\n“All religions are a single communion. The spectrum remains unbroken within the Golden Path. It is only that humans see first one part and then another. Delusions can be called accidents of the senses.”\n“People will still worship you,” she said.\n“Yes.”\n“But when forever ends, there will be anger,” she said. “There will be denial. Some will say you were just an ordinary tyrant.”\n“Delusion,” he agreed.\nA lump in her throat prevented her from speaking for a moment, then: “How does your life and your death change the ...” She shook her head.\n“Life will continue.”\n“|I believe that, Lord, but how?”\n“Each cycle is a reaction to the preceding cycle. If you think about the shape of my Empire, then you know the shape of the next cycle.”\nShe looked away from him. “Everything I learned about your Family told me that you would do this”—she gestured blindly in his direction without looking at him—“only with a selfless motive. | do not think I truly know the shape of your Empire, though.”\n“Leto’s Golden Peace?”\n“There is less peace than some would have us believe,” she said, looking back at him.\nThe honesty of her! he thought. Nothing deterred it.\n“This is the time of the stomach,” he said. “This is the time when we expand as a single cell expands.”\n“But something is missing,” she said.\nShe is like the Duncans, he thought. Something is missing and they sense it immediately.\n“The flesh grows, but the psyche does not grow,” he said.\n“The psyche?”\n“That reflexive awareness which tells us how very alive we can become. You know it well, Hwi. It is that sense which tells you how to be true to yourself.”\n“Your religion is not enough,” she said.\n“No religion can ever be enough. It is a matter of choice— a single, lonely choice. Do you understand now why your friendship and your company mean so much to me?”\nShe blinked back tears, nodding, then: “Why don’t people know this?”\n“Because the conditions don’t permit it.”\n“The conditions which you dictate?”\n“Precisely. Look throughout my Empire. Do you see the Shape?”\nShe closed her eyes, thinking.\n“One wishes to sit by a river and fish every day?” he asked. “Excellent. That is this life. You desire to sail a small boat across an island sea and visit strangers? Superb! What else is there to do?”\n“Travel in space?” she asked and there was a defiant note in her voice. She opened her eyes.\n“You have observed that the Guild and | do not allow this.”\n“You do not allow it.”\n“True. If the Guild disobeys me, it gets no spice.”\n“And holding people planetbound keeps them out of mischief.”\n“It does something more important than that. It fills them with a longing to travel. It creates a need to make far voyages and see strange things. Eventually, travel comes to mean freedom.”\n“But the spice dwindles,” she said.\n“And freedom becomes more precious every day.”\n“This can only lead to desperation and violence,” she said.\n“A wise man in my ancestry—I was actually that person, you know? Do you understand that there are no strangers in my past?”\nShe nodded, awed.\n“This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom. But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.”\n“The Guild and the Sisterhood enslave themselves!”\n“And the Ixians and the Tleilaxu and all the others. Oh, they ferret out a bit of hidden melange from time to time and that keeps the attention fixed. A very interesting game, don’t you think?”\n“But when the violence comes .. .”\n“There will be famines and hard thoughts.”\n“Here on Arrakis, too?”\n“Here, there, everywhere. People will look back on my tyranny as the good old days. | will be the mirror of their future.”\n“But it will be terrible!” she objected.\nShe could have no other reaction, he thought.\nHe said: “As the land refuses to support the people, the survivors will crowd into smaller and smaller refuges. A terrible selection process will be repeated on many worlds— explosive birthrates and dwindling food.”\n“But couldn’t the Guild...”\n“The Guild will be largely helpless without sufficient melange to operate available transports.”\n“Won't the rich escape?”\n“Some of them.”\n“Then you haven’t really changed anything. We will just go on struggling and dying.”\n“Until the sandworm reigns once more on Arrakis. We will have tested ourselves by then with a profound experience Shared by all. We will have learned that a thing which can happen on one planet can happen on any planet.”\n“So much pain and death,” she whispered.\n“Don’t you understand about death?” he asked. “You must understand. The species must understand. All life must understand.”\n“Help me, Lord,” she whispered.\n“It is the most profound experience of any creature,” he said. “Short of death come the things which risk and mirror it—life-threatening diseases, injuries and accidents... childbirth for a woman... and once it was combat for the males.”\n“But your Fish Speakers are...”\n“They teach about survival,” he said.\nHer eyes went wide with understanding. “The survivors. Of course!”\n“How precious you are,” he said. “How rare and precious. Bless the Ixians!”\n“And curse them?”\n“That, too.”\n“I did not think | could ever understand about your Fish Speakers,” she said.\n“Not even Moneo sees it,” he said. “And | despair of the Duncans.”\n“You have to appreciate life before you want to preserve it,” she said.\n“And it’s the survivors who maintain the most light and poignant hold upon the beauties of living. Women know this more often than men because birth is the reflection of death.”\n“My Uncle Malky always said you had good reasons for denying combat and casual violence to men. What a bitter\nlesson!”\n“Without readily available violence, men have few ways of testing how they will meet that final experience,” he said. “Something is missing. The psyche does not grow. What is it people say about Leto’s Peace?”\n“That you make us wallow in pointless decadence like pigs in our own filth.”\n“Always recognize the accuracy of folk wisdom,” he said. “Decadence.”\n“Most men have no principles,” she said. “The women of Ix complain about it constantly.”\n“When I need to identify rebels, | look for men with principles,” he said.\nShe stared at him silently, and he thought how that simple reaction spoke so deeply of her intelligence.\n“Where do you think | find my best administrators?” he asked.\nA small gasp escaped her.\n“Principles,” he said, “are what you fight for. Most men go through a lifetime unchallenged, except at the final moment. They have so few unfriendly arenas in which to test themselves.”\n“They have you,” she said.\n“But | am so powerful,” he said. “I am the equivalent of suicide. Who would seek certain death?”\n“Madmen... or desperate ones. Rebels?”\n“I am their equivalent of war,” he said. “The ultimate predator. | am the cohesive force which shatters them.”\n“I’ve never thought of myself as a rebel,” she said.\n“You are something far better.”\n“And you would use me in some way?”\n“| would.”\n“Not as an administrator,” she said.\n“I already have good administrators—uncorruptible, sagacious, philosophical and open about their errors, quick to see decisions.”\n“They were rebels?”\n“Most of them.”\n“How are they chosen?”\n“I could say they chose themselves.”\n“By surviving?”\n“That, too. But there’s more. The difference between a good administrator and a bad one is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixians are a group known for their advanced technology and machine-making, currently concealing an endeavor from others, including Leto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a powerful ruler with a deep understanding of the future and the Golden Path, known for his tyranny and philosophical insights.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI<|>PERSON<|>Hwi is a trusted companion of Leto, known for her honesty and strong moral core, created by the Ixians.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTEAC<|>PERSON<|>Anteac is a Reverend Mother sent by Leto to investigate the Ixians' concealed activities.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with deep influence, known for their teachings and manipulations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is Leto's vision for the future, ensuring the survival of humanity through his rule and eventual death.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is the desert planet central to Leto's rule and the source of the spice melange.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's female military force, teaching survival and maintaining his peace.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Guild is a powerful organization dependent on spice for space travel, controlled by Leto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive group known for their genetic manipulations and pursuit of wealth.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIANS<|>LETO<|>The Ixians are concealing an endeavor from Leto, who seeks to investigate them.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI<|>LETO<|>Hwi is a trusted companion and confidante of Leto, created by the Ixians.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTEAC<|>LETO<|>Anteac is sent by Leto to investigate the Ixians' activities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HWI<|>The Bene Gesserit attempted to teach Hwi but failed to change her core honesty.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>Leto is the architect of the Golden Path, ensuring humanity's survival through his rule.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ARRAKIS<|>Arrakis is the center of Leto's empire and the source of spice, which he controls.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's military force, teaching survival and maintaining his peace.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GUILD<|>Leto controls the Guild by restricting their access to spice.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Tleilaxu are among the groups enslaved by the pursuit of wealth under Leto's rule.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI<|>IXIANS<|>Hwi was created by the Ixians, who designed her with unique qualities.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
