  整个七彩色光球向外蔓延出足有直径十米左右，而且也只是绽放不到一秒，就缓缓收歇。\n\n    蓝轩宇碰触在一起的双手之间发出“铿”的一声脆鸣，随之分开。蓝轩宇也一下清醒过来。\n\n    然后他就得到提示，考核通过……\n\n    当他离开场地，整个人完全都是茫然状态的。\n\n    什么就通过了？\n\n

蓝轩宇突然瞪大了眼睛，因为他赫然发现，自己的魂力似乎整体减少了一些。胸口处的旋涡都变得减弱了几分。\n\n    不是结束考核魂力就该恢复到巅峰状态的吗？怎么会没有完全恢复？\n\n    心中吃惊的同时，他赶忙结束了模拟舱状态，立刻来到外面。\n\n    再次凝神内视，感受着自身变化，魂力依旧是减弱了，并没有恢复的意思。难道说，要通过冥想才能恢复？\n\n    匆匆回了宿舍，此时，其他人估计是考核还没有结束，刘锋和钱磊都没有回来。\n\n    坐在自己床铺上赶忙进行冥想。可是，只一会儿的工夫，蓝轩宇就脸色大变的重新睁开了双眼。\n\n    冥想状态显示，他现在的魂力就是最佳状态，可是，分明整体魂力减少了啊？\n\n    一种不祥的预感顿时萦绕在心头，蓝轩宇不敢怠慢，赶忙拿出宿舍里的魂力测试仪。\n\n
