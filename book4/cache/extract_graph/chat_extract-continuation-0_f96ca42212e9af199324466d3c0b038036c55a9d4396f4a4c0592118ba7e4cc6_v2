\n　　于是，象田四田五这样的人，再一次来到他的砖场。这些人拿了钱，得了好处，开始唾沫星子乱溅，一哇声说了少安的好话，孙少安“好财主”的名声扬遍了双水村和东拉河一带的许多地方。他成了全石圪节乡最有声望的“农民企业家”。 \n　　孙少安这阵势几乎把他父亲也弄成了石圪节集市上的“明星”。要是玉厚老汉上集走过这条灰尘飞扬的土街，庄稼人就会互相指划着说：“看，这就是孙少安他爸！”他到小摊上买肉，卖肉的人也把最肥的刀口肉切割了给他。 \n　　每当孙玉厚老汉提着一条子肥肉，在乡民们的羡慕的议论声中走过石圪节街头时，他脸上平静如常，但内心却常常不由得感慨万端。 \n　　啊！他一辈子已经不知多少次从这条土街上走过，什么时候受到这么多人的抬举呢？旧社会，他冬闲时给这里的掌柜吆牲灵到山西柳林驮瓷，每次都是天不明就从这街上起身，双手筒在破棉袄袖里，清鼻涕都冻在了嘴唇上。 \n　　以后，他又不知多少次到过这里，出售几个南瓜和一把旱烟叶，以便买点盐和点灯的煤油。那时间，谁能想得起他这个穿破衣裳的穷老百姓？更忘不了的是，那年公社开广播大会批判少安扩大猪饲料地，他和可怜的小女儿立在这土街上，怎样为儿子的命运担心骇怕呀……做梦也想不到，他孙玉厚老汉能有今天这等荣耀！ \n　　玉厚老汉骄傲的是，除过大女儿的光景叫人熬煎外，他含辛茹苦抚养的几个孩子，都成了好样的，大儿子现在不用说，一道川都是好名声。当然，少安以后免不了还会有些跌跌绊绊，但最叫人担心的时期也许已经过去了。 \n　　二小子当了煤矿工人，是说那营生又苦又不安全，但他对这孩子放心着哩！少平人虽年轻，但处事老成，不会出什么大差错。眼下，他唯一关心的是这孩子的婚姻问题。听说煤矿女的少，找个对象难，他已提醒少安给少平瞅个女娃娃。可少安说这一家里谁也替少平作不了主……那就等孩子探亲回家时再和他商量这事。 \n　　至于小女儿兰香，已经上了“大学堂”。据识字人说，这是中国的什么“重要学堂”；有人还推断说，他的兰香将来会“留洋”哩！ \n　　唉，唯一使他晚上熬煎得睡不着觉的仍然是大女儿兰花。该死的女婿一年逛得不归家门，丢下那母子三人受了多少牺惶！可怜两个小外孙，从\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
