，大喊一声，杀入寨中，径奔中军来杀曹操。原来中军人马，以车仗伏路穿连，围得铁桶相似，不能得进。甘宁只将百骑，左冲右突。曹兵惊慌，正不知敌兵多少，自相扰乱。那甘宁百骑，在营内纵横驰骤，逢着便杀。各营鼓噪，举火如星，喊声大震。甘宁从寨之南门杀出，无人敢当。孙权令周泰引一枝兵来接应。甘宁将百骑回到濡须。操兵恐有埋伏，不敢追袭。后人有诗赞曰：“鼙鼓声喧震地来，吴师到处鬼神哀！百翎直贯曹家寨，尽说甘宁虎将才。”甘宁引百骑到寨，不折一人一骑；至营门，令百人皆击鼓吹笛，口称“万岁”，欢声大震。孙权自来迎接。甘宁下马拜伏。权扶起，携宁手曰：“将军此去，足使老贼惊骇。非孤相舍，正欲观卿胆耳！”即赐绢千匹，利刀百口。宁拜受讫，遂分赏百人。权语诸将曰：“孟德有张辽，孤有甘兴霸，足以相敌也。”\n\n    次日，张辽引兵搦战。凌统见甘宁有功，奋然曰：“统愿敌张辽。”权许之。统遂领兵五千，离濡须。权自引甘宁临阵观战。对阵圆处，张辽出马，左有李典，右有乐进。凌统纵马提刀，出至阵前。张辽使乐进出迎。两个斗到五十合，未分胜败。曹操闻知，亲自策马到门旗下来看，见二将酣斗，乃令曹休暗放冷箭。曹休便闪在张辽背后，开弓一箭，正中凌统坐下马，那马直立起来，把凌统掀翻在地。乐进连忙持枪来刺。枪还未到，只听得弓弦响处，一箭射中乐进面门，翻身落马。两军齐出，各救一将回营，鸣金罢战。凌统回寨中拜谢孙权。权曰：“放箭救你者，甘宁也。”凌统乃顿首拜宁曰：“不想公能如此垂恩！”自此与甘宁结为生死之交，再不为恶。且说曹操见乐进中箭，令自到帐中调治。次日，分兵五路来袭濡须：操自领中路；左一路张辽，二路李典；右一路徐晃，二路庞德。每路各带一万人马，杀奔江边来。时董袭、徐盛二将，在楼船上见五路军马来到，诸军各有惧色。徐盛曰：“食君之禄，忠君之事，何惧哉！”遂引猛士数百人，用小船渡过江边，杀入李典军中去了。董袭在船上，令众军擂鼓呐喊助威。忽然江上猛风大作，白浪掀天，波涛汹涌。军士见大�\n######################\nOutput:",
