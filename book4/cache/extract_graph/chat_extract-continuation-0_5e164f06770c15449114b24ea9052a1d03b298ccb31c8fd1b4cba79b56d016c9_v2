名的惧怕。他归根结底是个农民，考虑问题往往从实际出发。他想：他的润叶是个农民的女儿，虽说成了公家人，但要和一个大干部的儿子结了婚，将来会不会受气？万一人家中途不要了，甩在半路上，那就等于要了他这一家人的命！ \n　　“我觉得这门亲事可以考虑，关键倒不是李登云的家庭如何，主要是向前这娃娃很喜欢润叶！”徐爱云对大哥说。“那润叶的意思哩？”田福堂问她。 \n　　“润叶直到现在也没表示个肯定态度。我很着急，因为李登云一家对这事太热心了。”爱云一边说，一边把一杯清凉饮料端到田福堂面前。 \n　　“噢……” \n　　田福堂在心里划算：润叶找少安那样的人家，是太低了。但找李登云这样的人家，也许又太高了。最好能找个中等人家，一般干部家庭的子弟就行了，最好不要高出县上的部局长家庭。太高了不好，因为他是个农民嘛！虽说福军和李主任的职位差不多，但润叶是他的女儿！ \n　　他于是抽出一支烟闻了闻，对弟媳妇说：“你最好给润叶寻个一般干部家庭。李主任那么高的位置，我是个农民，怕高攀不起人家！” \n　　爱云笑了，说：“大哥，你考虑事情太复杂。李登云是多大个官？还不是和福军一样……” \n　　“但我和人家不一样！” \n　　“这主要是两个娃娃的事。再说，人家李登云两口子也对润叶十分满意！” \n　　接着，徐爱云又给田福堂说了许多李登云两口子怎样喜欢润叶的情形。 \n　　田福堂听了这些事，才开始动心了。他说：“既然人家这么诚心实意，那这事你就看着办吧！我信得过你们！润叶虽然是我的娃娃，但你和福军也没少操过心。现在她又在你们身边，你们就稳稳妥妥给她找个人家。不过，这事要抓紧，女娃娃家年龄一大……”田福堂不知该怎样说，就赶忙低头闻了闻烟，接着便剧烈地咳嗽起来。他这才想起他给许多人说过他到城里来是看气管炎的。 \n　　等咳嗽平息了以后，他对爱云说：“我的气管炎近来越来越重了……” \n　　爱云马上说：“我现在就引你去顾老先生那里开几付中药。你这是慢性病，最好是吃中药。” \n　　田福堂久闻顾老先生的大名，就高兴地跟爱云去了中医科。 \n　　顾老和大部分名中医一样，白发红颜，戴一副老花镜，认真地给田福堂号脉。爱云对站在一边看书的顾老先生的孙子说：“田润生是不是和你一个班？” \n　　顾养民很有礼貌地回答说：“是一个班的，阿姨。”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>李登云<|>PERSON<|>李登云 is a person who is considered for marriage with 润叶,
