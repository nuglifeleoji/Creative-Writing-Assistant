紧亲自吆着牛，来到米家镇的兽医站。好在兽医站一检查，没什么大毛病，只是牛肚子里上了点火，兽医说灌几副药就会好的。当时开好药后，就给灌了一副。兽医站的人说，最好晚上十二点钟再灌一次。本来他想当天就返回双水村，但考虑牛有病，来回路上折腾一天，恐怕牲灵受不了，就决定在米家镇过一夜。 \n　　现在，他把最后一卷筒药汤灌进了牛嘴巴，亲热地拍拍牛脑袋，然后就疲乏地站起来，把空脸盆和卷筒放在窗台上。他看见牛的眼睛出现了一种活泼的亮色，心里就踏实了许多。 \n　　他出了牛棚，看见兽医站里一片黑灯瞎火。哪个窑洞里传出来一阵鼾声，打雷般响亮。这已经是深夜了。他迈着两条长腿，穿过院子，出了兽医站的土豁子大门，来到公路上。前面不远几步，就是米家镇的那条小街道。现在那里也已经没有了人迹，只有几盏昏黄的路灯，照耀着空荡荡的街道。 \n　　他现在到什么地方去度过这一夜呢？他白天抽不出身，也没到旅社去登记个床位。这是公事，他可以掏钱住一宿旅社。但现在旅社恐怕也住不上了。米家镇就一个小旅社，这里过往人多，通常天不黑就住满了人。 \n　　他从公路上盲目地向镇子里走去。唉，如果在石圪节，他还有些熟人，甚至还认得一两个公社干部，他哪里都可以凑合一夜的。可这米家镇已经到了外县，人生地不熟，他到什么地方去住这一夜呢？要是夏天也好，他可以在兽医站的院子里随便找个地方一躺就行了。这现在虽然已经开春，棉衣还没有离身呢，一早一晚怪冷的；米家镇又在大川道里，风特别硬。 \n　　他一路毫无主意地向街道那里走，并不知道他到了街上又能怎样。 \n　　他猛然想起：俊山叔的女儿金芳，不就出嫁在这米家镇上了吗？听说她女婿就在这镇上木匠铺里，家离街道也不太远。能不能去她家歇息一晚上呢？ \n　　他在朦胧的月光下摇了摇头，很快打消了这个念头。这已经夜半更深，人家早睡熟了，怎好意思敲门打窗惊动人家呢！ \n　　现在，他已经来到了街道上。这街道虽然也破破烂烂，但比石圪节多了许多铺子门面，看起来象个城镇的街道。少安惆怅地站在一根电杆下面，不知如何是好。昏黄的街灯照出他高大的身躯，脸型、身材和他弟少平非常相似，只不过因为劳动的缘故，显得更要壮实一些。高鼻梁直直的，也象希腊人一样。脸上分明的线条和两片稍稍向下弯曲\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
