Murbella appeared to be more angered than fearful. Excellent! But now was a time for caution.\n“You have complained about the slow pacing of your education,” Odrade said. “It was done with your needs foremost in our minds. Your key teachers all were chosen for steadiness, none of them impulsive. My instructions were explicit: ‘Don’t give you too many abilities too rapidly. Don’t open a floodgate of powers that might be more than she can handle.’”\n“How do you know what I can handle?” Still angry.\nOdrade only smiled.\nWhen Odrade continued silent, Murbella appeared flustered. Had she made a fool of herself before Mother Superior, before Duncan and these others? How humiliating.\nOdrade reminded herself it was not good to make Murbella too conscious of her vulnerability. A bad tactic just now. No need to provoke her. She had a sharp sense of the germane, fitting herself into needs of the moment. That was the thing they feared might have its source in a motivation always to choose the path of least resistance. Let it not be that. Complete honesty now! The ultimate tool of Bene Gesserit education. The classical technique that bound acolyte to teacher.\n“I will be at your side throughout your Agony. If you fail, | will grieve.”\n“Duncan?” Tears in her eyes.\n“Any help he can give, he will be permitted to give.”\nMurbella looked up the rows of seats and, for a brief moment, her gaze locked with Idaho’s. He lifted slightly but Tamalane’s hand on his shoulder restrained him.\nThey may kill my beloved! |daho thought. Must I sit here and just watch it happen? But Odrade had said he would be permitted to help. There is no stopping this now. | must trust Dar. But, gods below! She does not know the depth of my grief, if... if... He closed his eyes.\n“Bell.” Odrade’s voice carried a sense of casting off, a knife edge in its brittleness.\nBellonda took Murbella’s arm and helped her onto the table. It bounced slightly adjusting to the weight.\nThis is the real chute, Murbella thought.\nShe had only the remotest sense of straps being fastened around her, of purposeful movement beside her.\n“This is the usual routine,” Odrade said.\nRoutine? Murbella had hated the routines of becoming Bene Gesserit, all of that study, listening and reacting to Proctors. She had particularly loathed the necessity to refine reactions she had believed adequate but there could be no sloughing off under those watchful eyes.\nAdequate! What a dangerous word.\nThis recognition had been precisely what they sought. Precisely the leverage their acolyte required.\nIf you loathe it, do it better. Use your loathing as guidance; home in on exactly what you need.\nThe fact that her teachers saw so directly into her behavior, what a marvelous thing! She wanted that ability. Oh, how she wanted it!\n| must excel in this.\nIt was a thing any Honored Matre might envy. She saw herself abruptly with a form of doubled vision: both Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre. A daunting perception.\nA hand touched her cheek, moved her head and went away.\nResponsibility. | am about to learn what they mean by “a new sense of history.”\nThe Bene Gesserit view of history fascinated her. How did they look at multiple pasts? Was it something immersed in a grander scheme? The temptation to become one of them had been overwhelming.\nThis ts the moment when | learn.\nShe saw an oral syringe swing into position above her mouth. Bellonda’s hand moved it.\n“We carry our grail in our heads,” Odrade had said. “Carry this grail gently if it comes into your possession.”\nThe syringe touched her lips. Murbella closed her eyes but felt fingers open her mouth. Cold metal touched her teeth. Odrade’s remembered voice was with her.\nAvoid excesses. Overcorrect and you always have a fine mess on your hands, the necessity to make larger and larger corrections. Oscillation. Fanatics are marvelous creators of oscillation.\n“Our grail. It has linearity because each Reverend Mother carries the same determination. We will perpetuate this together.”\nBitter liquid gushed into her mouth. Murbella swallowed convulsively. She felt fire flow down her throat into her stomach. No pain except the burning. She wondered if this could be the extent of it. Her stomach felt merely warm now.\nSlowly, so slowly she was several heartbeats recognizing it, the warmth flowed outward. When it reached the tips of her fingers she felt her body convulse. Her back arched off the padded table. Something soft but firm replaced the syringe in her mouth.\nVoices. She heard them and knew people were speaking but could not distinguish words.\nAs she concentrated on the voices she became aware she had lost touch with her body. Somewhere, flesh writhed and there was pain but she was removed from it.\nA hand touched a hand and clasped it firmly. She recognized Duncan’s touch, and abruptly there was her body and agony. Her lungs pained when she exhaled. Not when she inhaled. Then they felt flat and never full enough. Her sense of presence in living flesh became a thin thread that wound through many presences. She sensed others all around her, far too many people for the tiny amphitheater.\nAnother human being floated into view. Murbella felt herself to be in a factory shuttle . . . in space. The shuttle was primitive. Too many manual controls. Too many blinking lights. A woman at the controls, small and untidy with the sweat of her labors. She had long brown hair and it had been bound up in a chignon from which paler strands escaped to hang around her narrow cheeks. She wore a single garment, a short dress of brilliant reds, blues, and greens.\nMachinery.\nThere was awareness of monstrous machinery just beyond this immediate space. The woman’s dress contrasted severely with the drab and dragging sense of machinery. She spoke but her lips did not move. “Listen, you! When it comes time for you to take over these controls, don’t become a destroyer. I’m here to help you avoid the destroyers. Do you know that?”\nMurbella tried to speak but had no voice.\n“Don’t try so hard, girl!” the woman said. “I hear you.”\nMurbella tried to shift her attention away from the woman.\nWhere is this place?\nOne operator, a giant warehouse... factory... everything automated . .. webs of feedback lines centered into this tiny space with its complex controls.\nThinking to whisper, Murbella asked: “Who are you?” and heard her own voice roar. Agony in her ears!\n“Not so loud! I’m your guide of the mohalata, the one who steers you clear of the destroyers.”\nDur protect me! Murbella thought. This is no place; it’s me!\nOn that thought, the control room vanished. She was a migrant in the void, condemned never to be quiet, never to find a moment of sanctuary. Everything but her own fleeting thoughts became immaterial. She had no substance, only a wispy adherence that she recognized as consciousness.\n| have constructed myself out of fog.\nOther Memory came, bits and pieces of experiences she knew were not her own. Faces leered at her and demanded her attention but the woman at the shuttle controls pulled her away. Murbella recognized necessities but could not put them into coherent form.\n“These are lives in your past.” It was the woman at the shuttle controls but her voice had a disembodied quality and came from no discernible place.\n“We are descendants of people who did nasty things,” the woman said. “We don’t like to admit there were barbarians in our ancestry. A Reverend Mother must admit it. We have no choice.”\nMurbella had the knack of only thinking her questions now. Why must !/...\n“The victors bred. We are their descendants. Victory often was gained at great moral price. Barbarism is not even an adequate word for some of the things our ancestors did.”\nMurbella felt a familiar hand on her cheek. Duncan! The touch restored agony. Oh, Duncan! You're hurting me.\nThrough the pain, she sensed gaps in the lives being revealed to her. Things withheld.\n“Only what you’re capable of accepting now,” the disembodied voice said. “Others come later when you’re stronger... if you Survive.”\nSelective filter. Odrade’s words. Necessity opens doors.\nPersistent wailing came from the other presences. Laments: “See? See what happens when you ignore common sense?”\nAgony increased. She could not escape it. Every nerve was touched with flame. She wanted to cry, to scream threats, to implore for help. Tumbling emotions accompanied the agony but she ignored them. Everything happened along a thin thread of existence. The thread could Snap!\nI’m dying.\nThe thread was stretching. It was going to break! Hopeless to resist. Muscles would not obey. There probably were no muscles remaining to her. She did not want them anyway. They were pain. It was hell and would never end... not even if the thread snapped. Flames burned along the thread, licking at her awareness.\nHands shook her shoulders. Duncan... don’t. Each movement was pain beyond anything she had imagined possible. This deserved to be called the Agony.\nThe thread no longer was stretching. It was pulling back, compressing. It became one small thing, a sausage of such exquisite pain that nothing else existed. The sense of being became vague, translucent... transparent.\n“Do you see?” the voice of her mohalata guide came from far away.\n| see things.\nNot exactly seeing. A distant awareness of others. Other sausages. Other Memory encased in the skins of lost lives. They extended behind her in a train whose length she could not determine. Translucent fog. It ripped apart occasionally and she glimpsed events. No... not events themselves. Memory.\n“Share witness,” her guide said. “You see what our ancestors have done. They debase the worst curse you can invent. Don’t make excuses about necessities of the times! Just remember: There are no innocents!”\nUgly! Ugly!\nShe could hold on to none of it. Everything became reflections and ripping fog. Somewhere there was a glory\nthat she knew she might attain.\nAbsence of this Agony.\nThat was it. How glorious that would be!\nWhere is that glorious condition?\nLips touched her forehead, her mouth. Duncan! She reached up. My hands are free. Her fingers slipped into remembered hair. This is real!\nAgony receded. Only then did she realize that she had come through pain more terrible than words could describe. Agony? It seared the psyche and remolded her. One person entered and another emerged.\nDuncan! She opened her eyes and there was his face directly above her. Do I still love him? He is here. He is an anchor to which I clung in the worst moments. But do I love him? Am I still balanced?\nNo answer.\nOdrade spoke from somewhere out of view. “Strip those clothes off her. Towels. She’s drenched. And bring her a proper robe!”\nThere were scurrying sounds, then Odrade once more: “Murbella, you did that the hard way, I’m glad to say.”\nSuch elation in her voice. Why was she glad?\nWhere is the sense of responsibility? Where is the grail l'm supposed to feel in my head? Answer me, someone!\nBut the woman at the shuttle controls was gone.\nOnly | remain. And I remember atrocities that might make an\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_238361680ede9b55f8a63f35aa8dac4732a63a8854fff41b43bde730b8e65e46_v2"}
