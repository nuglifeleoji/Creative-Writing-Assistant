followed her words, they heard a muttering of people, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber.\n“Reverend Mother?”\nA woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgar’s wives.\n“What is it, Tharthar?”\n“There is trouble, Reverend Mother.”\nJessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. “Paul...” she gasped.\nTharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at Tharthar—a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars.\n“What is it?” Jessica demanded.\n“There is word from the sand,” Tharthar said. “Usul meets the maker for his test...it is today. The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider by nightfall. The young men are banding for a razzia. They will raid in the north and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then. They say they will force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.”\nGathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely—these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The /ittle raids, the certain raids—these are no longer enough now that Paul and | have trained them. They feel their power. They want to fight.\nTharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.\nWe know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but there’s the core of our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long\ncan do us. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting’s prolonged.\n“The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be afraid,” Tharthar said.\nShe lowered her gaze.\n“So that’s the way of it,” Jessica muttered. And she thought: Well I saw it coming. As did Stilgar.\nAgain, Tharthar cleared her throat. “Even my brother, Shoab, says it,” she said. “They will leave Usul no choice.”\nThen it has come, Jessica thought. And Paul will have to handle it himself. The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.\nAlia freed her hand from her mother’s, said: “I will go with Tharthar and listen to the young men. Perhaps there Is a way.”\nJessica met Tharthar’s gaze, but spoke to Alia: “Go, then. And report to me as soon as you can.”\n“We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother,” Tharthar said.\n“We do not want it,” Jessica agreed. “The tribe needs a//its strength.” She glanced at Harah. “Will you go with them?”\nHarah answered the unspoken part of the question: “Tharthar will allow no harm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to share the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and |.” Harah looked up at Tharthar, back to Jessica. “We have an understanding.”\nTharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: “We must hurry. The young men are leaving.”\nThey pressed through the hangings, the child’s hand in the small woman's hand, but the child seemed to be leading.\n“If Paul-Muad’Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe,” Harah said. “Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed.”\n“Times have changed for you, as well,” Jessica Said.\n“You cannot think | doubt the outcome of such a battle,” Harah said. “Usul could not but win.”\n“That was my meaning,” Jessica said.\n“And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment,” Harah said. She shook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. “How wrong you are. Perhaps you think, as well, that | regret not being the chosen of Usul, that | am jealous of Chani?”\n“You make your own choice as you are able,” Jessica said.\n“| pity Chani,” Harah said.\nJessica stiffened. “What do you mean?”\n“I know what you think of Chani,” Harah said. “You think she is not the wife for your son.”\nJessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. “Perhaps.”\n“You could be right,” Harah said. “If you are, you may find a Surprising ally—Chani herself. She wants whatever is best for Him.”\nJessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. “Chani’s very dear to me,” she said. “She could be no—”\n“Your rugs are very dirty in here,” Harah said. She Swept her gaze around the floor, avoiding Jessica’s\neyes. “So many people tramping through here all the time. You really should have them cleaned more often.”\nYou cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: THE RELIGIOUS ISSUES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul waited on the sand outside the gigantic maker's line of approach. / must not wait like a smuggler—impatient and jittering, he reminded himself. / must be part of the desert.\nThe thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the friction-hissing of its passage. Its great teeth within the cavern-circle of its mouth spread like some enormous flower. The spice odor from it dominated the air.\nPaul’s stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of his nose plugs, the breathing mask. Stilgar’s teaching, the painstaking hours on the sand, overshadowed all else.\n“How far outside the maker’s radius must you Stand in pea sand?” Stilgar had asked him.\nAnd he had answered correctly: “Half a meter for every meter of the maker’s diameter.”\n“Why?”\n“To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount it.”\n“You've ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life,” Stilgar had said. “But what you'll summon for your test is a wild maker, an old man of the desert. You must have proper respect for such a one.”\nNow the thumper’s deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching worm. Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness of sand even through his filters. The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed almost on him. Its cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees.\nCome up, you lovely monster, he thought. Up. You hear me calling. Come up. Come up.\nThe wave lifted his feet. Surface dust swept across him. He steadied himself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand-clouded curving wall, that segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.\nPaul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in. He felt them bite and pull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against the clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the segment, the worm would not roll down and crush him.\nThe worm slowed. It glided across the thumper, silencing it. Slowly, it began to roll—up, up—bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible, away from\nthe sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.\nPaul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like an emperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to turn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.\nSuddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young men who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their backs, removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them.\nLeaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower down the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as it rolled, it turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited.\nPaul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the sensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a triple line behind him, steadied against their hooks.\nStilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul’s hooks, glanced up at Paul’s smiling face.\n“You did it, eh?” Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their passage. “That’s what you think? You did it?” He straightened. “Now | tell you that was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who do better. There was drumsand to your left where you waited. You could not retreat there if the worm turned that way.”\nThe smile slipped from Paul’s face. “I saw the drumsand.”\n“Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to you? It was a thing you could do even in the test.”\nPaul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.\n“You think it bad of me to say this now,” Stilgar said. “It is my duty. | think of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the maker would’ve turned toward you.”\nIn spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth. It took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. “I apologize,” he said. “It will not happen again.”\n“In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take the maker if you cannot,” Stilgar said. “Remember that we work together. That way, we're certain. We work together, eh?”\nHe slapped Paul’s shoulder.\n“We work together,” Paul agreed.\n“Now,” Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, “show me you know how to handle a maker. Which side are we on?”\nPaul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently. As it grew older, the characteristic up-side became an\nalmost constant thing. Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales could be told by size alone on a big worm.\nShifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead. The left-side steersman opened a ring segment there.\nIn a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment. Full around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: “Geyrat!”\nThe steersman released his hook", " the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left.

The maker lined out in a straight course.\nStilgar said, “Very good, Paul-Muad’Dib. With plenty of practice, you may yet become a sandrider.”\nPaul frowned, thinking: Was / not first up?\nFrom behind him there came sudden laughter. The troop began chanting, flinging his name against the Sky.\n“Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!”\nAnd far to the rear along the worm’s surface, Paul heard the beat of the goaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed. Their robes flapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage increased.\nPaul looked back through the troop, found Chani’s face among them. He looked at her as he spoke to Stilgar. “Then | am a sandrider, Stil?”\n“Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day.”\n“Then | may choose our destination?”\n“That’s the way of it.”\n“And | am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erg. | have had no life before this day. | was as a Child until this day.”\n“Not quite a child,” Stilgar said. He fastened a corner of his hood where the wind was whipping it.\n“But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been pulled.”\n“There is no cork.”\n“I would go south, Stilgar—twenty thumpers. | would see this land we make, this land that I’ve only seen through the eyes of others.”\nAnd I would see my son and my family, he thought. / need time now to consider the future that is a past within my mind. The turmoil comes and if l'm not where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.\nStilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze. Paul kept his attention on Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also the excitement his words had kindled in the troop.\n“The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks,” Stilgar said. “The sinks are only a thumper away.”\n“The Fedaykin have raided with me,” Paul said. “They'll raid with me again until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.”\nStilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing this moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the Tabr sietch and to leadership of the Council of Leaders now that Liet-Kynes was dead.\nHe has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen, Paul thought.\n“Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?” Stilgar asked.\nEyes blazed among the young men of the troop. They swayed as they rode, and they watched. And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chani’s glance, the way She looked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul- Muad’Dib, who was her mate.\n“You cannot guess what | want,” Paul said.\nAnd he thought: / cannot back down. | must hold control over these people.\n“You are mudir of the sandride this day,” Stilgar said. Cold formality rang in his voice: “How do you use this power?”\nWe need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thought.\n“We shall go south,” Paul said.\n“Even if | say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?”\n“We shall go south,” Paul repeated.\nA sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly around him. “There will be a Gathering,” he said. “I will send the messages.”\nHe thinks | will call him out, Paul thought. And he knows he cannot stand against me.\nPaul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of the necessities that went into his decisions.\nThey do not know how it is, he thought.\nBut he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him. He had to remain on the central line of\nthe time storm he could see in the future. There would come an instant when it could be unraveled, but only if he were where he could cut the central knot of it.\nI will not call him out if it can be helped, he thought. /f there’s another way to prevent the jihad.... “We'll camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath Habbanya Ridge,” Stilgar said.\nHe steadied himself with one hook against the swaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the desert.\nPaul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves. No green, no blossom softened that rigid horizon. Beyond it stretched the way to the southern desert—a course of at least ten days and nights, as fast as they could goad the makers.\nTwenty thumpers.\nThe way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols. He knew how it would be. The dreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there’d be a faint change of color on the far horizon—such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining it out of his hopes—and there would be the new sietch.\n“Does my decision suit Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked. Only the faintest touch of sarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every tone ina bird’s cry or a cielago’s piping message, heard the Sarcasm and watched Paul to see what he would do.\n“Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the Fedaykin,” Paul said. “My death commandos know | spoke with honor. Does Stilgar doubt it?”\nReal pain exposed itself in Paul’s voice. Stilgar heard it and lowered his gaze.\n“Usul, the companion of my sietch, him | would never doubt,” Stilgar said. “But you are Paul- Muad’Dib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. These men | don’t even know.”\nPaul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert. The maker beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry them almost twice the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He knew it. There was nothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of the desert. It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized.\nA hand gripped his shoulder.\nPaul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it—the dark eyes of Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.\n“The one who led Tabr sietch before me,” Stilgar said, “he was my friend. We shared dangers. He owed me his life many a time...and | owed him mine.”\n“lam your friend, Stilgar,” Paul said.\n“No man doubts it,” Stilgar said. He removed his hand, shrugged. “It’s the way.”\nPaul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the possibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of his predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in the desert. Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.\n“We should leave this maker in deep sand,” Paul Said.\n“Yes,” Stilgar agreed. “We could walk to the cave from here.”\n“We've ridden him far enough that he’ll bury himself and sulk for a day or so,” Paul said.\n“You're the mudir of the sandride,” Stilgar said. “Say when we...” He broke off, stared at the eastern Sky.\nPaul whirled. The spice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark, a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in Sharp contrast.\nOrnithopter!\n“One small ‘thopter,” Stilgar said.\n“Could be a scout,” Paul said. “Do you think they’ve seen us?”\n“At this distance we’re just a worm on the Surface,” Stilgar said. He motioned with his left hand. “Off. Scatter on the sand.”\nThe troop began working down the worm’s sides, dropping off, blending with the sand beneath their cloaks. Paul marked where Chani dropped. Presently, only he and Stilgar remained.\n“First up, last off,” Paul said.\nStilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand. Paul waited until the maker was Safely clear of the scatter area, then released his hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted.\nFreed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the sand. Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and leaped off. He landed running, lunged against the\nSlipface of a dune the way he had been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe.\nNow, the waiting....\nPaul turned, gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe. He imagined the others back along their path doing the same.\nHe heard the beat of the ’thopter’s wings before he saw it. There was a whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a broad arc toward the ridge.\nAn unmarked ‘thopter, Paul noted.\nIt flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge.\nA bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.\nPaul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top. Other figures stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge. He recognized Chani and Stilgar among them.\nStilgar signaled toward the ridge.\nThey gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a broken rhythm that would disturb no maker. Stilgar paced himself beside Paul along the windpacked crest of a dune.\n“It was a smuggler craft,” Stilgar said.\n“So it seemed,” Paul said. “But this is deep into the desert for smugglers.”\n“They've their difficulties with patrols, too,” Stilgar said.\n“If they come this deep, they may go deeper,” Paul said.\n“True.”\n“It wouldn’t be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured too deep into the south. Smugglers sell information, too.”\n“They were hunting spice, don’t you think?” Stilgar asked.\n“There will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one,” Paul said. “We’ve spice. Let’s bait a patch of sand and catch us some Smugglers. They should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new weapons.”\n“Now, Usul speaks,” Stilgar said. “Usul thinks Fremen.”\nBut Usul must give way to decisions that", " the windpacked crest of a dune.\n“It was a smuggler craft,” Stilgar said.\n“So it seemed,” Paul said. “But this is deep into the desert for smugglers.”\n“They've their difficulties with patrols, too,” Stilgar said.\n“If they come this deep, they may go deeper,” Paul said.\n“True.”\n“It wouldn’t be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured too deep into the south.

You are always a little less than an individual.\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: THE NINETY-NINE WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe smuggler’s spice factory with its parent carrier\nand ring of drone ornithopters came over a lifting of dunes like a swarm of insects following its queen. Ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the desert floor like small imitations of the Shield Wall. The dry beaches of the ridge were swept clean by a recent storm.\nIn the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape. Beyond the ridge, he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow, and he gave the signal to a hovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate.\nThe ‘thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal. It broke away from the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the area with its detectors dangling close to the surface.\nAlmost immediately, it went through the wing- tucked dip and circle that told the waiting factory that spice had been found.\nGurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal. He liked this spot. The ridge offered some shielding and protection. This was\ndeep in the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush... still.... Gurney signaled for a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent reserves to take up station in pattern around the area—not too high because then they could be seen from afar by Harkonnen detectors.\nHe doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south. This was still Fremen country.\nGurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless out here. Anything that Summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs. He rubbed the inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it would be safest to lead a ground party through the ridge. Inspection on foot was still the most certain. You couldn’t be too careful when Fremen and Harkonnen were at each other’s throats.\nIt was Fremen that worried him here. They didn’t mind trading for all the spice you could afford, but they were devils on the warpath if you stepped foot where they forbade you to go. And they were so devilishly cunning of late.\nIt annoyed Gurney, the cunning and adroitness in battle of these natives. They displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything he had ever encountered, and he had been trained by the best fighters in the universe then seasoned in battles where only the superior few survived.\nAgain Gurney scanned the landscape, wondering why he felt uneasy. Perhaps it was the worm they had seen...but that was on the other side of the ridge.\nA head popped up into the con-bubble beside Gurney—the factory commander, a one-eyed old\npirate with full beard, the blue eyes and milky teeth of a spice diet.\n“Looks like a rich patch, sir,” the factory commander said. “Shall | take ’er in?”\n“Come down at the edge of that ridge,” Gurney ordered. “Let me disembark with my men. You can tractor out to the spice from there. We'll have a look at that rock.”\n“Aye.”\n“In case of trouble,” Gurney said, “save the factory. We'll lift in the ‘thopters.”\nThe factory commander saluted. “Aye, sir.” He popped back down through the hatch.\nAgain Gurney scanned the horizon. He had to respect the possibility that there were Fremen here and he was trespassing. Fremen worried him, their toughness and unpredictability. Many things about this business worried him, but the rewards were great. The fact that he couldn’t send spotters high overhead worried him, too. The necessity of radio silence added to his uneasiness.\nThe factory crawler turned, began to descend. Gently it glided down to the dry beach at the foot of the ridge. Treads touched sand.\nGurney opened the bubble dome, released his Safety straps. The instant the factory stopped, he was out, slamming the bubble closed behind him, scrambling out over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond the emergency netting. The five men of his personal guard were out with him, emerging from the nose hatch. Others released the\nfactory’s carrier wing. It detached, lifted away to fly in a parking circle low overhead.\nImmediately the big factory crawler lurched off, Swinging away from the ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand.\nA 'thopter swooped down nearby, skidded to a stop. Another followed and another. They disgorged Gurney’s platoon and lifted to hoverflight.\nGurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit, stretching. He left the filter mask off his face, losing moisture for the sake of a greater need—the carrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands. He began climbing up into the rocks, checking the terrain—pebbles and pea sand underfoot, the smell of spice.\nGood site for an emergency base, he thought. Might be sensible to bury a few supplies here.\nHe glanced back, watching his men spread out as they followed him. Good men, even the new ones he hadn't had time to test. Good men. Didn’t have to be told every time what to do. Not a shield glimmer showed on any of them. No cowards in this bunch, carrying shields into the desert where a worm could sense the field and come to rob them of the spice they found.\nFrom this slight elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the spice patch about half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near edge. He glanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude—not too high. He nodded to himself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge.\nIn that instant, the ridge erupted.\nTwelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering ‘thopters and carrier wing. There came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler, and the rocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men.\nGurney had time to think: By the horns of the Great Mother! Rockets! They dare to use rockets!\nThen he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low, crysknife at the ready. Two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to left and right. Only the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to Gurney between hood and veil of a sand- colored burnoose, but the crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained fighting man. The eyes were the blue-in-blue of the deep-desert Fremen.\nGurney moved one hand toward his own knife, kept his eyes fixed on the other’s knife. If they dared use rockets, they’d have other projectile weapons. This moment argued extreme caution. He could tell by sound alone that at least part of his skycover had been knocked out. There were gruntings, too, the noise of several struggles behind him.\nThe eyes of the fighting man ahead of Gurney followed the motion of hand toward knife, came back to glare into Gurney’s eyes.\n“Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck,” the man said.\nGurney hesitated. That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit filter.\n“You know my name?” he said.\n“You’ve no need of a knife with me, Gurney,” the man said. He straightened, slipped his crysknife into its sheath back beneath his robe. “Tell your men to Stop their useless resistance.”\nThe man threw his hood back, swung the filter aside.\nThe shock of what he saw froze Gurney’s muscles. He thought at first he was looking at a ghost image of Duke Leto Atreides. Full recognition came slowly.\n“Paul,” he whispered. Then louder: “Is it truly Paul?”\n“Don’t you trust your own eyes?” Paul asked.\n“They said you were dead,” Gurney rasped. He took a half-step forward.\n“Tell your men to submit,” Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower reaches of the ridge.\nGurney turned, reluctant to take his eyes off Paul. He saw only a few knots of struggle. Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around. The factory crawler lay silent with Fremen standing atop it. There were no aircraft overhead.\n“Stop the fighting,” Gurney bellowed. He took a deep breath, cupped his hands for a megaphone. “This is Gurney Halleck! Stop the fight!”\nSlowly, warily, the struggling figures separated. Eyes turned toward him, questioning.\n“These are friends,” Gurney called.\n“Fine friends!” someone shouted back. “Half our people murdered.”\n“It’s a mistake,” Gurney said. “Don’t add to it.”\nHe turned back to Paul, stared into the youth’s blue-blue Fremen eyes.\nA smile touched Paul’s mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression that reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Paul’s grandfather. Gurney saw then the sinewy harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an Atreides—a leathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance that seemed to weigh everything in sight.\n“They said you were dead,” Gurney repeated.\n“And it seemed the best protection to let them think so,” Paul said.\nGurney realized that was all the apology he’d ever get for having been abandoned to his own resources, left to believe his young Duke...his friend, was dead. He wondered then if there were anything left here of the boy he had known and trained in the ways of fighting men.\nPaul took a step closer to Gurney, found that his eyes were smarting. “Gurney....”\nIt seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each other on the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh.\n“You young pup! You young pup!” Gurney kept saying.\nAnd Paul: “Gurney, man! Gurney, man!”\nPresently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep breath. “So you’re why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics. | might’ve known. They keep doing things I could’ve planned myself. If I'd only known....” He shook his head. “If you’d only got word to me, lad. Nothing would've stopped me. I’d have come arunning and...”\nA look in Paul’s eyes stopped him...the"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_4fac8e5ce57750633b7476a904c62c9530c37010027e9e17a37b3f24d07744c1_v2"}
