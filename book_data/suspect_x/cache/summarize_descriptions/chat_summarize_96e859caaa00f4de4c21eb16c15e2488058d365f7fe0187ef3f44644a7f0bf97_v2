Despite his role as a trusted advisor, HAWAT holds BARON responsible for the massive attack on House Atreides, indicating a complex and potentially strained relationship. BARON, however, continues to rely on HAWAT for strategic planning, suggesting that their professional alliance persists despite underlying tensions. This dynamic highlights HAWAT's dual position as both a key strategist under BARON's service and a figure who harbors resentment toward him for past actions.
