物。过去，都是她“教导”他，现在，他倒给她带来了许多对生活新鲜的看法和理解。尽管生活逼迫他走了这样一条艰苦的道路，但这却是很不平凡的。她马上为在自己的生活中有这样一个朋友而感到骄傲。她想她要全力帮助他。毫无疑问，生活不会使她也走和他相同的道路——她不可能脱离她的世界。但她完全理解孙少平的所作所为。她兴奋的是，孙少平为她的生活环境树立了一个“对应物”；或者说给她的世界形成了一个奇特的“坐标”。 \n　　田晓霞不知不觉已经遛达到了麻雀山下的丁字路口。现在她不再幻想少平还会调过头来找她——这已经是夜晚了。她于是调过头，又慢慢往回遛达。 \n　　街道上已经没什么人了，路灯在水迹斑斑的街面上投下长长的光影。对面山上，立锥似的九级古塔在朦胧中直指乱云翻飞的夜空。没有星星，没有月亮；清冷的风吹过远山的树林，掀起一阵喧哗。黄原河雄浑的涛声和小南河朗朗的流水声，听起来象二重奏……她也忍不住唱起来——快乐的风啊， \n　　你给我们唱个歌吧！ \n　　快乐的风啊！ \n　　你吹遍全世界的高山和海洋，全球都听到你的歌声。 \n　　唱吧，风呀！ \n　　对着险峻的山峰，对着神秘的海洋，对着鸟雀的细语，对着蔚蓝的天际，对着勇敢伟大的人物。 \n　　谁要是能够为胜利而奋斗，就让他同我们齐歌唱。 \n　　谁要快乐就能微笑，谁要做就能成功，谁要寻找就能得到……这是苏联电影《格兰特船长的孩子们》中的插曲。她没有看过这电影，但喜欢唱这首歌。 \n　　田晓霞怀着兴奋的心情，随着自己的歌声，脚步竟渐渐变成了进行式。她穿过空荡荡的街道往家里走去。她觉得她和少平的交往将会带有一种神秘的色彩，可能象浪漫小说中描写的故事一样——想到这点使她更加激动！ \n　　她回到家后，六间房子有一间亮着灯光，说明只有外祖父一个人在家。父亲下乡没有回来，母亲在医院值夜班。润叶姐在团地委办公室住，通常都不回家来。 \n　　她听见爷爷在房子里说话。她以为来了客人，但仔细一听，原来是他在数落那只老黑猫——说它最近挑肥拣瘦，只想吃肉不啃骨头；老黑猫只用“喵呜”来回答他的指责。 \n　　晓霞在走道时舌头一吐，忍不住笑了。家里人都忙，经常顾不上和爷爷拉拉话，他就整天和那只猫唠唠叨叨说个没完。 \n　　她不准备打断他们的“交谈”，就�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
