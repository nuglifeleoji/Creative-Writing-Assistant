试验传送,加密级别较低，能够被破解，这无疑是最重要的监视对象，是了解美国太空侦察系统不可多得的机会。可是第三天，杨卫宁竟命令转移监听频率和方向，丢开了这个目标，叶文洁总觉得这不可理解。\n　　另一件事则令她震惊：虽然身在监听部，但发射部有些事情还让她去做。一次，她无意中看到了未来几次发射计划的频率设置，发现在第304、318和325次发射中，确定的发射频率己低出了微波范围，不可能在目标上产生任何热效应。\n　　这天，突然有人通知叶文洁到基地总部办公室去，从那名军官的语气和神色中，叶文洁感到了不样。走进办公室后，一个似曾相识的场景出现了：基地的主要领导都在场，还有两名不认识的军官，一看就是更高一级部门来的人，所有人冰冷的目光聚焦到她身上。但这么多年的风风雨雨形成的敏感告诉她，今天倒霉的人可能不是她，她最多是一个陪葬品。她看到雷志成政委坐在一角，神色黯然。他终于要为对我的信任付出代价了，这是叶文洁心中冒出的第一个念头，她在一瞬间暗下决心，为了不牵连到雷政委，一定要将事情向自己身上揽，甚至不惜说谎。但她没有想到第一个开口的竟然就是雷政委，他的话更是完全出乎自己的预料。\n　　“叶文洁，首先声明，我是不同意这么做的，下面的决定是杨总工程师请示上级后做出的，他将对后果负完全责任。”说完他看了杨卫宁一眼，后者郑重地点点头，“为了更好地发挥你在红岸基地的作用，这些天来，经过杨总工程师反复向上级请示，兵种政治部派来的同志也了解了你的工作情况，”他指了指那两名陌生的军官，“经过上级同意，我们决定将红岸工程的真实情况告诉你。”\n　　过了好半天，叶文洁才明白了雷政委这话的含意：他一直在欺骗她！\n　　“希望你珍惜这次机会。努力工作，立功赎罪。今后，你在基地只许老老实实，不许乱说乱动，任何反动行为都将受到最严厉的惩罚。”雷政委盯着叶文洁厉声说道，与以前叶文洁眼中的他相比仿佛换了一个人，“听明白了吗？那好，请杨总工程师为你介绍红岸工程的情况吧。”其他人纷纷离去，办公室中只剩下杨卫宁和叶文洁两人。\n　　“如果你不同意，现在还来得及。”杨卫宁说。叶文洁知道这话的分量，也理解了杨卫宁这些天见到她时的那种焦躁。为了在基地发挥她的才华，必须让她知道红岸工程的真实情况，但这又意味着叶文洁走出雷达峰的最后一线希望也将不复存在。红岸基地将是她一生最终的归宿。\n　　“我同意。”叶文洁轻轻地。但坚定地说。于是，在这个\n######################\nOutput:",
