and offer my help in the investigation.”\nAnd Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.\n“Will there be something on the Fremen?” Paul asked.\n“The Fremen?” Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.\n“Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,” Paul said.\n“Yes, to be sure,” Yueh said. “There are two general separations of the people—Fremen, they are\none group, and the others are the people of the graben, the sink, and the pan. There’s some intermarriage, I’m told. The women of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives. They have a saying: ‘Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.’”\n“Do you have pictures of them?”\n“I'll see what | can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is their eyes—totally blue, no whites in them.”\n“Mutation?”\n“No; it’s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.”\n“The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.”\n“By all accounts,” Yueh said. “They compose poems to their knives. Their women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous. You'll not be permitted to mingle with them, | daresay.”\nPaul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!\n“And the worms?” Paul asked.\n“What?”\n“ld like to study more about the sandworms.”\n“Ah-h-h, to be sure. I’ve a filmbook on a small specimen, only one hundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been recorded by reliable\nwitnesses, and there’s reason to believe even larger ones exist.”\nPaul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen latitudes spread on the table. “The desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?”\n“And the storms.”\n“But any place can be made habitable.”\n“If it’s economically feasible,” Yueh said. “Arrakis has many costly perils.” He smoothed his drooping mustache. “Your father will be here soon. Before | go, I’ve a gift for you, something | came across in packing.” He put an object on the table between them—black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul’s thumb.\nPaul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought: How cautious he is.\n“It’s a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system.” He picked it up, demonstrated. “The book is held closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the edge—thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens.”\n“It’s so small.”\n“But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge—thus, and so...and the charge moves ahead one page ata time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.” He closed the book, handed it to Paul. “Try it.”\nYueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: / salve my own conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may | say to myself that he has gone where | cannot go.\n“This must’ve been made before filmbooks,” Paul Said.\n“It’s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too valuable for one so young.”\nAnd Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.\n“Well....” Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. “If it’s so valuable....”\n“Indulge an old man’s whim,” Yueh said. “It was given to me when | was very young.” And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. “Open it to four-sixty-seven Kalima—where it says: ‘From water does all life begin.’ There’s a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place.”\nPaul felt the cover, detected two notches, one Shallower than the other. He pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier sliding into place.\n“Read it aloud,” Yueh said.\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, read: “‘Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is there around us that we cannot—’”\n“Stop it!” Yueh barked.\nPaul broke off, stared at him.\nYueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna’s favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him.\n“Is something wrong?” Paul asked.\n“I'm sorry,” Yueh said. “That was...my...dead wife’s favorite passage. It’s not the one | intended you to read. It brings up memories that are...painful.”\n“There are two notches,” Paul said.\nOf course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.\n“You may find the book interesting,” Yueh said. “It has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.”\nPaul looked down at the tiny book in his palm— such a small thing. Yet, it contained a mystery... something had happened while he read from it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose.\n“Your father will be here any minute,” Yueh said. “Put the book away and read it at your leisure.”\nPaul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself. He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him, Paul had feared the man would demand the book’s return.\n“I thank you for the gift, Dr. Yueh,” Paul said, speaking formally. “It will be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not hesitate to ask.”\n“l,..need for nothing,” Yueh said.\nAnd he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this poor lad...though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen beasts! Why did they choose me for their abomination?\nHow do we approach the study of Muad’Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?\n—FROM “MUAD’'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.\nThe Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed only by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded his narrow waist.\nThe Duke said: “Hard at work, Son?”\nHe crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze around the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not showing his fatigue. / must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to Arrakis, he thought. There'll be no rest on Arrakis.\n“Not very hard,” Paul said. “Everything’s so....” He shrugged.\n“Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It’ll be good to get settled in our new home, put all this upset behind.”\nPaul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother’s words: “...for the father, nothing.”\n“Father,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?”\nThe Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind—the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The pattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought:\nThis is my son.\n“It’ll be dangerous,” he admitted.\n“Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,” Paul said. And he wondered: Why don’t I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?\nThe Duke noted his son’s distress, said: “As always, Hawat sees the main chance. But there’s much more. | see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles—the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship...a subtle gain.”\n“CHOAM controls the spice,” Paul said.\n“And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,” the Duke said. “There’s more to CHOAM than melange.”\n“Did the Reverend Mother warn you?” Paul blurted. He clenched his fists, feeling his palms\nSlippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask that question.\n“Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,” the Duke said. “Don’t let a woman’s fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your mother’s. Take this as a sign of her love for us.”\n“Does she know about the Fremen?”\n“Yes, and about much more.”\n“What?”\nAnd the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even dangerous facts are valuable if you've been trained to deal with them. And there’s one place where nothing has been spared for my son—dealing with dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.\n“Few products escape the CHOAM touch,” the Duke said. “Logs, donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur—the most prosaic and the most exotic...even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.”\n“And now we control it?”\n“To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product—the spice.\nImagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production.”\n“Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,” Paul said. “Others would be out in the cold.” The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim\nsatisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how", ", horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur—the most prosaic and the most exotic...even our poor pundi rice from Caladan.

He nodded. “The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.”\n“They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.”\n“They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,” the Duke said. “Think of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership—their unofficial sookesman. Think how they’d react if | were responsible for a serious reduction in their income. After all, one’s own profits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can’t let someone pauperize you!” A harsh smile twisted the Duke’s mouth. “They’d look the other way no matter what was done to me.”\n“Even if we were attacked with atomics?” “Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost anything else short of that...\nperhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning.”\n“Then why are we walking into this?”\n“Paul!” The Duke frowned at his son. “Knowing where the trap is—that’s the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale —a feint within a feint within a feint...seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask another\nquestion: Who else is stockpiling? That’s the list of our enemies.”\n“Who?”\n“Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we'd thought friendly. We need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more important: our beloved Padishah Emperor.”\nPaul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. “Couldn’t you convene the Landsraad, expose—”\n“Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul—we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If we put this before the Landsraad it’d only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we’d gain is a little time while risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?”\n“All the Houses might start stockpiling spice.”\n“Our enemies have a head start—too much of a lead to overcome.”\n“The Emperor,” Paul said. “That means the Sardaukar.”\n“Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,” the Duke said. “But the soldier fanatics nonetheless.”\n“How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?”\n“Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?”\n“The Emperor’s prison planet? No.”\n“What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There’s a question you never hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come from?”\n“From the prison planet?”\n“They come from somewhere.”\n“But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from—”\n“That’s what we're led to believe: they're just the Emperor’s levies trained young and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor’s training cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the military forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and their supporting levies on the other. And their Supporting levies, Paul. The Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar.”\n“But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!”\n“Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men, what environmental conditions would you impose on them?”\n“How could you win the loyalty of such men?”\n“There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority, the mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done. It has been done on many worlds in many times.”\nPaul nodded, holding his attention on his father’s face. He felt some revelation impending.\n“Consider Arrakis,” the Duke said. “When you get outside the towns and garrison villages, it’s every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus.”\nPaul’s eyes went wide. “The Fremen!”\n“We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the Sardaukar. It'll require patience to\nexploit them secretly and wealth to equip them properly. But the Fremen are there...and the spice wealth is there. You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.”\n“Don’t the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?”\n“The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even bothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary populations—spend as little as possible to maintain them.”\nThe metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father’s breast glistened as the Duke shifted his position. “You see?”\n“We're negotiating with the Fremen right now,” Paul said.\n“I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,” the Duke said. “A proud and ruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. | think the Fremen will admire him. If we're lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.”\n“Duncan, the moral,” Paul said, “and Gurney the valorous.”\n“You name them well,” the Duke said.\nAnd Paul thought: Gurney’s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a supporter of worlds—”“... the valor of the brave.”\n“Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,” the Duke said.\n“That isn’t what he told me.”\nThe Duke laughed aloud. “I figured Gurney to be Sparse with his praise. He says you have a nicety of\nawareness—in his own words—of the difference between a blade’s edge and its tip.”\n“Gurney says there’s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be done with the edge.”\n“Gurney’s a romantic,” the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly disturbed him, coming from his son. “I’d sooner you never had to kill...but if the need arises, you do it however you can—tip or edge.” He looked up at the skylight, on which the rain was drumming.\nSeeing the direction of his father’s stare, Paul thought of the wet skies out there—a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts—and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. “Are the Guild ships really big?” he asked.\nThe Duke looked at him. “This wi// be your first time off planet,” he said. “Yes, they’re big. We'll be riding a Heighliner because it’s a long trip. A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner—we'll be just a Small part of the ship’s manifest.”\n“And we won't be able to leave our frigates?”\n“That’s part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we’d have nothing to fear from them. The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.”\n“I’m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.”\n“You won’t. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild’s as jealous of its privacy as it\nis of its monopoly. Don’t do anything to endanger our Shipping privileges, Paul.”\n“Do you think they hide because they’ve mutated and don’t look...Auman anymore?”\n“Who knows?” The Duke shrugged. “It’s a mystery we're not likely to solve. We’ve more immediate problems—among them: you.”\n“Me?”\n“Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have Mentat capabilities.”\nPaul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: “A Mentat? Me? But l....”\n“Hawat agrees, Son. It’s true.”\n“But | thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldn’t be told because it might inhibit the early....” He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. “I see,” he said.\n“A day comes,” the Duke said, “when the potential Mentat must learn what’s being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about himself.”\nPaul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother—the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices—all of it clicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind.\n“You'll be the Duke someday, Son,” his father said. “A Mentat Duke would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now...or do you need more time?”\nThere was no hesitation in his answer. “lIl go on with the training.”\n“Formidable indeed,” the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his father’s face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke’s narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he thought.\nBut even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica’s latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n—FROM “ANALYSIS: THE ARRAKEEN CRISIS” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN (PRIVATE CIRCULATION: B.G.

She could hear the cargo handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.\nJessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a Slow turn, looking up and around at shadowed Carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters’ Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the\nschool the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone.\nSome architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood.\nShe thought not.\nThis had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their new megalopolis of Carthag—a cheap and brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.\nAgain there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica sighed.\nAgainst a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke’s father. Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was still clutched in Jessica’s left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull’s head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull’s shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room.\nJessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things first—the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke’s buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself.\nThe head and the picture.\nThey heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these latitudes the sky looked black and cold—so much darker than the warm blue of Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.\nSo far away, Caladan.\n“Here we are!”\nThe voice was Duke Leto’s.\nShe whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall. His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked dusty and rumpled.\n“I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,” he said.\n“It is a cold house,” she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of sharp angles and planes.\nA sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage, driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor’s command.\n“The whole city feels cold,” she said.\n“It’s a dirty, dusty little garrison town,” he agreed. “But we'll change that.” He looked around the hall. “These are public rooms for state occasions. I’ve just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They’re much nicer.” He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.\nAnd again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry —a renegade House, perhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor’s own blood.\nUnder the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile. And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.\nHe remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her.\n“Where's Paul?” he asked.\n“Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.”\n“Probably in the south wing,” he said. “I thought | heard Yueh’s voice, but | couldn’t take time to look.” He glanced down at her, hesitating. “I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.”\nShe caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the key—there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for comforting. “I Saw our banner over the house as we came in,” she said.\nHe glanced at the painting of his father. “Where were you going to hang that?”\n“Somewhere in here.”\n“No.” The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.\n“My Lord,” she said, “if you’d only....”\n“The answer remains no. | indulge you shamefully in most things, not in this. I’ve just come from the dining hall where there are—”\n“My Lord! Please.”\n“The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear,” he said. “They will hang in the dining hall.”\nShe sighed. “Yes, my Lord.”\n“You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. | shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.”\n“Thank you, my Lord.”\n“And don’t go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that | never married you, my dear. Then it’d be your duty to join me at table for every meal.”\nShe held her face immobile, nodded.\n“Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,” he said. “There’s a portable in your\nroom.”\n“You anticipated this...disagreement,” she said.\n“My dear, | think also of your comfort. I’ve engaged servants. They’re locals, but Hawat has cleared them—they’re Fremen all. They'll do until our own people can be released from their other duties.”\n“Can anyone from this place be truly safe?”\n“Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.”\n“Shadout,” Jessica said. “A Fremen title?”\n“I’m told it means ‘well-dipper,’ a meaning with rather important overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan’s report. They’re convinced she wants to serve—specifically that she wants to serve you.”\n“Me?”\n“The Fremen have learned that you’re Bene Gesserit,” he said. “There are legends here about the Bene Gesserit.”\nThe Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.\n“Does this mean Duncan was successful?” she asked. “Will the Fremen be our allies?”\n“There’s nothing definite,” he said. “They wish to observe us for a while, Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period. That’s a more important gain than it might seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It\nwouldn’t have helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.”\n“A Fremen housekeeper,” Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the Shadout Mapes. “She’ll have the all-blue eyes.”\n“Don’t let the appearance of these people deceive you,” he said. “There’s a deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they'll be everything we need.”\n“It’s a dangerous gamble,” she said.\n“Let’s not go into that again,” he said.\nShe forced a smile. “We are committed, no doubt of that.” She went through the quick regimen of calmness—the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then: “When I assign rooms, is there anything special | should reserve for you?”\n“You must teach me someday how you do that,” he said, “the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.”\n“It’s a female thing,” she said.\nHe smiled. “Well, assignment of rooms: make certain | have large office space next to my sleeping quarters. There'll be more paper work here than on Caladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don’t worry about security of the house. Hawat’s men have been over it in depth.”\n“I’m sure they have.”\nHe glanced at his wristwatch. “And you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for Arrakeen local. I’ve assigned a tech to take care of it. He’ll be along presently.” He brushed a strand of her hair\nback from her forehead. “I must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle’s due any minute with my staff reserves.”\n“Couldn’t Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.”\n“The good Thufir is even busier than | am. You know this planet’s infested with Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, | must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change of fief—and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He’s allowing the opt. About eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there’s a Guild cargo ship standing by.”\n“My Lord....” She broke off, hesitating.\n“Yes?”\nHe will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n“At what time will you be expecting dinner?” she asked.\nThat’s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place—alone, the two of us, without a care.\n“I'll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late. And...ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. | want him to attend our strategy conference.”\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out,\nheaded for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the Great Hall.
