沟的公社会战工地上赶回来，等待县上的两位领导。今年农田基建规模大，明川亲自去会战工地领导。他回公社机关的时候，委托徐治功全面负责工地上的事。 \n　　田福军和张有智听了白明川的汇报后，对这里的工作比较满意。柳岔公社所有过火的做法，今年石圪节公社都没有。 \n　　福军和有智都比较喜欢白明川。这小伙子虽然年轻，但很有头脑。他到县上来开会，常能提出一些很不一般的见解，而且也敢当面对冯世宽和县上的一些政策提不同意见，常常充当各公社主任的“代言人”。 \n　　晚上，因为公社也没什么人，白明川就叫灶房里简单炒了几个菜，拿出自己的一瓶“西风”酒，三个人就在明川的办公窑里，一边慢慢抿酒，一边随便拉起了话。 \n　　喝了几杯酒以后，白明川并没有兴奋起来，反而忧心忡忡地对两位县上的领导说：“你们虽然是我的上级，但我了解你们，你们也了解我。再说，酒场上的话，柴草不挂……”“你们公社有啥问题哩？你说！我们能解决的，尽量解决！”脸已经有点发红的张有智对白明川说。 \n　　白明川把筷子放到桌上，说：“我不是说我们公社。我是说咱们国家……国家再这样下去，可就不得了！本来，邓副主席恢复工作以来，采取了很多得人心的措施。可你们也能感觉来，最近有些人已对他的做法开始旁敲侧击地发起了进攻……” \n　　“周文龙就已经散布说邓副主席还搞修正主义那一套！”张有智也把筷子搁在了桌子上。 \n　　白明川笑了笑：“我那同学他是个小人物，光他这种人物济不上事！”他收敛了笑容，“那些大人物才可怕呢！我指的是中央的一些人，他们都在毛主席身边……” \n　　田福军两条胳膊搁在桌子上，专心地听明川说话。他喜欢地看着这个黑胡麻楂的青年人，说：“明川，你能考虑这么重大的问题，很不简单。好！尽管我们都是些普通人，无法改变我们国家的局面，但我们应该有一双分辩黑白的眼睛，有一颗能严肃思考我们国家命运的头脑……你感觉到的问题，任何一个有头脑，有良心的中国人都会感觉到的。这不是我们几个人的忧虑，而是全中国人民的忧虑……” \n　　张有智在田福军说话的时候，连喝了几大杯酒，已经有点醉了，趴在桌子上，眼里竟然噙满泪水，说：“我晚上常和老婆说这些事，两个人有时候一晚上都合不住眼……唉，按说咱现在有职有位，有吃有喝，可是国家搞成这个样子，个人满嘴沙糖嚼起来都是苦的！建国二十五年了，群众还吃不饱饭！我看见工地上穿得烂囊囊的农民\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
