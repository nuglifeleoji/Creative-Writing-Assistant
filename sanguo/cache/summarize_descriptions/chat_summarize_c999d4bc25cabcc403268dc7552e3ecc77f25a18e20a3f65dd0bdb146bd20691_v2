Founded by Liu Bei, Shu Han represented his ambitions to establish a legitimate rule and restore the Han legacy amidst a tumultuous political landscape. The state is characterized by its governance under notable figures such as Zhuge Liang, who played a crucial role in its administration and military strategies.\n\nThroughout its existence, Shu Han faced numerous challenges and conflicts, primarily against its rival states, Wei and Wu. These struggles were emblematic of the broader power dynamics of the era, as Shu Han sought to assert its influence and maintain its sovereignty. The state is often recognized for its emphasis on values such as loyalty and righteousness, which were central to Liu Bei's leadership philosophy.\n\nShu Han's military campaigns, particularly those led by Jiang Wei, further illustrate its ongoing efforts to resist the encroachments of Wei and Wu. Despite its valiant efforts and strategic initiatives, Shu Han ultimately grappled with the limitations of its resources and the formidable strength of its adversaries.\n\nIn summary, Shu Han stands as one of the three kingdoms of the Three Kingdoms period, founded by Liu Bei, and is remembered for its struggles against rival states, its governance under Zhuge Liang, and its commitment to the ideals of loyalty and righteousness in the face of adversity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898612, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 615, "total_tokens": 887, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
