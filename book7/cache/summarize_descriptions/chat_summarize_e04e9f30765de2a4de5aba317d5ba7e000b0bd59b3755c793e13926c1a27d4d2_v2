It is often enjoyed in social settings, making it a favored choice for gatherings among friends and family. In this context, 靖子 and her daughter engaged in KTV after watching a movie, highlighting the activity as a form of leisure and bonding between them.\n\nAdditionally, KTV is described as a type of entertainment venue, which is relevant to a specific timeline associated with a case.
