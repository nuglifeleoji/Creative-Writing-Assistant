\n　　沉默。 \n　　血液在热情中燃烧。目光迸射出爱恋的火花。 \n　　我们不由想起当初的伊甸园和其间偷吃了禁果后的亚当与夏娃（上帝！幸亏他们犯了那个美好的错误……）。 \n　　没有爱情，人的生活就不堪设想，爱情啊！它使荒芜变为繁荣，平庸变为伟大；使死去的复活，活着的闪闪发光。即便爱情是不尽的煎熬，不尽的折磨，象冰霜般严厉，烈火般烤灼，但爱情对心理和身体健康的男女永远是那样的自然；同时又永远让我们感到新奇、神秘和不可思议……当然，我们和这里拥抱的他们自己都深知，他们毕竟不是伊甸园里上帝平等的子民。 \n　　她来自繁华的都市，职业如同鼓号般响亮，身上飘溢着芳香，散发出现代生活优越的气息。 \n　　他，千百普通矿工中的一员，生活中极其平凡的角色，几小时前刚从黑咕隆咚的地下钻出来，身上带着洗不净的煤尘和汗臭味。 \n　　他们看起来是这样的格格不入。 \n　　但是，他们拥抱在一起。 \n　　直到现在，孙少平仍然难以相信田晓霞就在他怀里。说实话，从黄原分手他们后，他就无法想象他们再一次相会将是何种情景。尤其到大牙湾后，井下生活的严酷性更使他感到他和她相距有多么遥远。他爱她，但他和她将不可能在一块生活——这就是问题的全部结症！ \n　　可是，现在她来了。 \n　　可是，纵使她来了，并且此刻她就在她的怀抱里，而那个使他痛苦的“结症”就随之消失了吗？ \n　　没有。 \n　　此时，在他内心汹涌澎湃的热浪下面，不时有冰凉的潜流湍湍而过。 \n　　但是，无论如何，眼下也许不应该和她谈论这种事。这一片刻的温暖对他是多么宝贵；他要全身心地沉浸于其中…… \n　　现在，他们一个拉着一个的手，透过森林的空隙，静静地望着对面的矿区。此刻正是两个班交接工作的时候，象火线上的部队在换防。上井的工人走出区队办公大楼，下井的工人正从四面八方的黑户区走向井口。在矿部前的小广场周围，到处都是纷乱的人群。 \n　　孙少平手指着对面，从东到西依次给晓霞介绍矿区的情况。 \n　　后来，他指着矿医院上面的一个小山湾，声音低沉地说：“那是一块坟地。埋的全是井下因工亡故的矿工。” \n　　晓霞长久地望着那山湾。她看见，山湾里，坟堆前都立着墓�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
