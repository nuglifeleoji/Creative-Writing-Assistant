却说田丰在狱中。一日，狱吏来见丰曰：“与别驾贺喜！”丰曰：“何喜可贺？”狱吏曰：“袁将军大败而回，君必见重矣。”丰笑曰：“吾今死矣！”狱吏问曰：“人皆为君喜，君何言死也？”丰曰：“袁将军外宽而内忌，不念忠诚。若胜而喜，犹能赦我；今战败则羞，吾不望生矣。”狱吏未信。忽使者赍剑至，传袁绍命，欲取田丰之首，狱吏方惊。丰曰：“吾固知必死也。”狱吏皆流泪。丰曰：“大丈夫生于天地间，不识其主而事之，是无智也！今日受死，夫何足惜！”乃自刎于狱中。后人有诗曰：“昨朝沮授军中失，今日田丰狱内亡。河北栋梁皆折断，本初焉不丧家邦！”田丰既死，闻者皆为叹惜。\n\n    袁绍回冀州，心烦意乱，不理政事。其妻刘氏劝立后嗣。绍所生三子长子袁谭字显思，出守青州；次子袁熙字显奕，出守幽州；三子袁尚字显甫，是绍后妻刘氏所出，生得形貌俊伟，绍至爱之，因此留在身边。自官渡兵败之后，刘氏劝立尚为后嗣，绍乃与审配、逢纪、辛评、郭图四人商议、原来审、逢二人，向辅袁尚；辛、郭二人，向辅袁谭；四人各为其主。当下袁绍谓四人曰：“今外患未息，内事不可不早定，吾将议立后嗣：长子谭，为人性刚好杀；次子熙，为人柔懦难成；三子尚，有英雄之表，礼贤敬士，吾欲立之。公等之意若何？”郭图曰：“三子之中，谭为长，今又居外；主公若废长立幼，此乱萌也。今军威稍挫，敌兵压境，岂可复使父子兄弟自相争乱耶？主公且理会拒敌之策，立嗣之事，毋容多议。”袁绍踌躇未决。忽报袁熙引兵六万，自幽州来；袁谭引兵五万，自青州来；外甥高干亦引兵五万，自并州来：各至冀州助战。绍喜，再整人马来战曹操。时操引得胜之兵，陈列于河上，有土人箪食壶浆以迎之。操见父老数人，须发尽白，乃命入帐中赐坐，问之曰：“老丈多少年纪？”答曰：“欲近百岁矣。”操曰：“吾军士惊扰汝乡，吾甚不安。”父老曰：“桓帝时，有黄星见于楚、宋之分，辽东人殷馗善晓天文，夜宿于此，对老汉等言：黄星见于乾象，正照此间。后五十年，当有真人起于梁沛之\n######################\nOutput:",
