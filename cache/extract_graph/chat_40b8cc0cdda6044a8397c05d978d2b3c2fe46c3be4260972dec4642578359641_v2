He’s a good officer under most circumstances, but he'll fight for his own principles only ina friendly arena.”\n“His... principles?”\n“The difference between a good officer and a poor one is strength of character and about five heartbeats,” he said. “He has to stick by his principles wherever they’re challenged.”\n“The tigers were necessary,” she said.\n“PIL believe that if they succeed,” he said. “But I will not condone what had to be done in training them. Don’t protest. It’s obvious. They were conditioned. You said it yourself.”\n“What're you going to do?” she asked.\n“I’m going to wait and see,” he said. “Perhaps l'Il become Emperor.”\nShe put a hand to her breast, sighed. For a few moments there he’d terrified her. She’d almost believed he would denounce her. Principles! But he was committed now; she could see that.\nFarad’n got up, went to the door and rang for his mother’s attendants. He looked back: “We are through, aren’t we?”\n“Yes.” She raised a hand as he started to leave. “Where’re you going?”\n“To the library. I’ve become fascinated lately by Corrino history.” He left her then, sensing how he carried his new commitment with him.\nDamn her!\nBut he knew he was committed. And he recognized that there was a deep emotional difference between history as recorded on shigawire and read at leisure, a deep difference between that kind of history and the history which one lived. This new living history which he felt gathering around him possessed a sense of plunging into an irreversible future. Farad’n could feel himself driven now by the desires of all those whose fortunes rode with him. He found it strange that he could not pin down his own desires in this.\nIt is said of Muad’Dib that once when he saw a weed trying to grow between two rocks, he moved one of the rocks. Later, when the weed was seen to be flourishing, he covered it with the remaining rock. “That was its fate,” he explained.\n—THE COMMENTARIES\nll N ow!” Ghanima shouted.\nLeto, two steps ahead of her in reaching the narrow cut in the rocks, did not hesitate. He dove into the slit, crawled forward until darkness enfolded him. He heard Ghanima drop behind him, a sudden stillness, and her voice, not hurrying or fearful:\n“I'm stuck.”\nHe stood up, knowing this would bring his head within reach of questing claws, reversed himself in the narrow passage, crept back until he felt Ghanima’s outstretched hand.\n“It’s my robe,” she said. “It’s caught.”\nHe heard rocks falling directly below them, pulled on her hand but felt only a small gain.\nThere was panting below them, a growl.\nLeto tensed himself, wedging his hips against the rock, heaved on Ghanima’s arm. Cloth ripped and he felt her jerk toward him. She hissed and he knew she felt pain, but he pulled once more, harder. She came farther into the hole, then all the way, dropping beside him. They were too close to the end of the cut, though. He turned, dropped to all fours, scrambled deeper. Ghanima pulled herself along behind him. There was a panting intensity to her movements which told him she’d been hurt. He came to the end of the opening, rolled over and peered upward out the\nnarrow gap of their sanctuary. The opening was about two meters above him, filled with stars. Something large obscured the stars.\nA rumbling growl filled the air around the twins. It was deep, menacing, an ancient sound: hunter speaking to its prey.\n“How badly are you hurt?” Leto asked, keeping his voice even.\nShe matched him, tone for tone: “One of them clawed me. Breached my stillsuit along the left leg. I’m bleeding.”\n“How bad?”\n“Vein. | can stop it.”\n“Use pressure,” he said. “Don’t move. l'Il take care of our friends.”\n“Careful,” she said. “They’re bigger than | expected.” Leto unsheathed his crysknife, reached up with it. He knew the tiger would be questing downward, claws raking\nthe narrow passage where its body could not go.\nSlowly, slowly, he extended the knife. Abruptly something struck the top of the blade. He felt the blow all along his arm, almost lost his grip on the knife. Blood gushed along his hand, spattered his face, and there came an immediate scream which deafened him. The stars became visible. Something threshed and flung itself down the rocks toward the sand in a violent caterwauling.\nOnce more, the stars were obscured and he heard the hunter’s growl. The second tiger had moved into place, unmindful of its companion’s fate.\n“They're persistent,” Leto said.\n“You got one for sure,” Ghanima said. “Listen!”\nThe screams and thrashing convulsions below them were growing fainter. The second tiger remained, though, a curtain against the stars.\nLeto sheathed his blade, touched Ghanima’s arm. “Give me your knife. | want a fresh tip to make sure of this one.”\n“Do you think they’ll have a third one in reserve?” She asked.\n“Not likely. Laza tigers hunt in pairs.”\n“Just as we do,” she said.\n“As we do,” he agreed. He felt the handle of her crysknife Slip into his palm, gripped it tightly. Once more he began that careful upward questing. The blade encountered only empty air, even when he reached into a level dangerous to his body. He withdrew, pondering this.\n“Can't you find it?”\n“It’s not behaving the way the other one did.”\n“It’s still there. Smell it?”\nHe swallowed in a dry throat. A fetid breath, moist with the musky smell of the cat, assaulted his nostrils. The stars were still blocked from view. Nothing could be heard of the first cat; the crysknife’s poison had completed its work.\n“I think I’m going to have to stand up,” he said.\n“No!”\n“It has to be teased into reach of the knife.”\n“Yes, but we agreed that if one of us could avoid being wounded...”\n“And you're wounded, so you're the one going back,” he said.\n“But if you’re badly injured, | won’t be able to leave you,’ she said.\n“Do you have a better idea?”\n“Give me back my knife.”\n“But your leg!”\n“I can stand on the good one.”\n“That thing could take your head off with one sweep. Maybe the maula...”\n“If there’s anyone out there to hear, they'll know we came prepared for—”\n“| don’t like your taking this risk!” he said.\n“Whoever’s out there mustn’t learn we have maulas—not yet.” She touched his arm. “I'll be careful, keep my head\n,\ndown.”\nAs he remained silent, she said: “You know I’m the one who has to do this. Give me back my knife.”\nReluctantly he quested with his free hand, found her hand and returned the knife. It was the logical thing to do, but logic warred with every emotion in him.\nHe felt Ghanima pull away, heard the sandy rasping of her robe against the rock. She gasped, and he knew she must be standing. Be very careful! he thought. And he almost pulled her back to insist they use a maula pistol. But that could warn anyone out there that they had such weapons. Worse, it could drive the tiger out of reach, and they’d be trapped in here with a wounded tiger waiting for them in some unknown place out on those rocks.\nGhanima took a deep breath, braced her back against one wall of the cleft. / must be quick, she thought. She reached upward with the knife point. Her left leg throbbed where the claws had raked it. She felt the crusting of blood against her skin there and the warmth of a new flow. Very quick! She sank her senses into the calm preparation for crisis which the Bene Gesserit Way provided, put pain and all other distractions out of her awareness. The cat must reach down! Slowly she passed the blade along the opening. Where was the damned animal? Once more she raked the air. Nothing. The tiger would have to be lured into attack.\nCarefully she probed with her sense of smell. Warm breath came from her left. She poised herself, drew ina deep breath, screamed: “Taqwa!” It was the old Fremen battlecry, its meaning found in the most ancient legends: “The price of freedom!” With the cry she tipped the blade and stabbed along the cleft’s dark opening. Claws found her elbow before the knife touched flesh, and she had time only to tip her wrist toward the pain before agony raked her arm from elbow to wrist. Through the pain, she felt the poison tip sink into the tiger. The blade was wrenched from her numb fingers. But again the narrow gap of the cleft lay open to the\nstars and the wailing voice of a dying cat filled the night. They followed it by its death throes, a thrashing passage down the rocks. Presently the death-silence came.\n“It got my arm,” Ghanima said, trying to bind a loose fold of her robe around the wound.\n“Badly?”\n“I think so. | can’t feel my hand.”\n“Let me get a light and—”\n“Not until we get under cover!”\n“VIE hurry.”\nShe heard him twisting to reach his Fremkit, felt the dark Slickness of a nightshield as it was slipped over her head, tucked in behind her. He didn’t bother to make it moisture tight.\n“My knife’s on this side,” she said. “I can feel the handle with my knee.”\n“Leave it for now.”\nHe ignited a single small globe. The brilliance of it made her blink. Leto put the globe on the sandy floor at one side, gasped as he saw her arm. One claw had opened a long, gaping wound which twisted from the elbow along the back of her arm almost to the wrist. The wound described the way she had rotated her arm to present the knife tip to the tiger’s paw.\nGhanima glanced once at the wound, closed her eyes and began reciting the Litany Against Fear.\nLeto found himself sharing her need, but put aside the clamor of his own emotions while he set about binding up the wound. It had to be done carefully to stop the flow of blood while retaining the appearance of a clumsy job which Ghanima might have done by herself. He made her tie off the knot with her free hand, holding one end of the bandage in her teeth.\n“Now let’s look at the leg,” he said.\nShe twisted around to present the other wound. It was not as bad: two shallow claw cuts along the calf. They had bled\nfreely into the stillsuit, however. He cleaned it up as best he could, bound the wound beneath the stillsuit. He sealed the suit over the bandage.\n“I got sand in it,” he said. “Have it treated as soon as you get back.”\n“Sand in our wounds,” she said. “That’s an old story for Fremen.”\nHe managed a smile, sat back.\nGhanima took a deep breath. “We've pulled it off.”\n“Not yet.”\nShe swallowed, fighting to recover\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_40b8cc0cdda6044a8397c05d978d2b3c2fe46c3be4260972dec4642578359641_v2"}
