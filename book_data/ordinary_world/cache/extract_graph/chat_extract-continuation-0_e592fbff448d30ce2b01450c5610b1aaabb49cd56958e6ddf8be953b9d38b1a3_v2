�着大地。大年呆坐在土场上，汗水在那张像高一样红扑扑的脸上流淌，两只手在泥地上抠来抠去。他妈在来边流泪。他硬劝说他妈回了家。他让她放心：他决不会自寻短见，他只是想一个人在这里静静地呆一会。 \n　　当然，他让他妈离开这里还有一个更主要的原因，因为他看见小丽正从县城那边的公路上走回来。她要回家，必然要经过这个土场。 \n　　他眼前升起了另一颗太阳。痛苦暂时又被一种莫名激动所淹没。他等着她向他走来。 \n　　她走来了。她显然没料到会在这儿碰到他，脸上明显地带着一种惊讶——也许这样说不准确。但这种难以描述的表情很快就消失了。她立即兴历地掏出了一张纸片在他眼前晃了晃，用颤抖的声音说：“我的录取通知书！省师范大学化学系，是报考的第二志愿……”她也才十九岁，根本不能在一个遭受巨大痛苦的人面前掩饰自己的欢欣。当她明白过来她这一举动的不妥当的时候，已经为时过晚。她可怕地发现，她面前这个人脸一下子变得像死灰似的惨白，接着，听从坐到地上，双手抱住了脑袋。 \n　　“我过几天就得走，报到时间很紧……”她开始尽量掩饰她的激动，但声音仍然在颤抖着。 \n　　“咱们将永远是好朋友。”别看她年龄小，倒也学会了一点世故。她这句话实际上暗示了一种明确的思想。 \n　　可惜老实巴结的他，听不懂这句话里的真实含义，反而被激动了；但她不等他开口，马上又裤充说：“我们年龄都小，以前是闹着玩哩，本来，我真盼望我们一起上大学，将来……我心里很为你难过。大年，你想开些，你的学习本来不错，可人的命运难说。当然，我们将永远是好朋友……” \n　　唉！原来是这样。这一回他算真听懂了。他感到眼前的太阳一下子失去了那耀眼的光辉。他用惨重的代价换来的竟是这么轻描淡写的几句话！ \n　　在这短暂的一刻里，就把高大年从童年保持到现在的所有天真都永远地扫除干净了。是的，他第一次知道：人生实际上是多么严峻啊！ \n　　他什么话也没说，用袖口揩去脸上的汗水，像他父亲刚才那样，拧转身就走了。不过，他不他父亲那样把关在胸前，而是尽量地抬起来，那神态等于明白地向全世界宣告：他高大年现在才真正成为一个男子汉了。 \n　　痛苦……这是不言而喻的。这双重的打击，就是搁在饱经世故的成年人身上，也够沉重的了，何况他才十九岁——严格说来，还是一个孩子哩。 \n　　他原来就为多说话，现在完全沉默了，像个\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
