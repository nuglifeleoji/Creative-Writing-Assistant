The sandtrout skin which | accepted\n(and my father refused) and which gave me greatly amplified strength plus virtual immunity from conventional attack and aging—that skin still covered a form recognizably human: two legs, two arms, a human face framed in the scrolled folds of the sandtrout.\nAhhh, that face! | still have it—the only human skin | expose to the universe.

My legs and feet? Well, they are mostly atrophied. Just flippers, really, and they have wandered back along my body. The whole of me weighs approximately five old tons. These items | append because | know they will have historical interest.\nHow do I carry this weight around? Mostly on my Royal Cart, which is of Ixian manufacture. You are shocked?

The participants are Siona herself and her father, Moneo, who was (as all the histories tell us) a majordomo and chief aide to Leto II. It is dated at a time when Siona was still in her teens and was being visited by her father at her quarters in the Fish Speakers’ School at the Festival City of Onn, a major population center on the planet now known as Rakis. According to the manuscript identification papers, Moneo had visited his daughter secretly to warn her that she risked destruction.\nSIONA: How have you survived with him for so long a time, father? He kills those who are close to him. Everyone knows that.\nMONEO: No! You are wrong. He kills no one.\nSIONA: You needn't lie about him.\nMONEO: | mean it. He kills no one.\nSIONA: Then how do you account for the Known deaths?\nMONEO: It is the Worm that kills. The Worm is God. Leto lives in the bosom of God, but he kills no one.\nSIONA: Then how do you survive?\nMONEO: | can recognize the Worm. | can see it in his face and in his movements. | know when Shai-Hulud approaches.\nSIONA: He is not Shai-Hulud!\nMONEO: Well, that’s what they called the Worm in the Fremen days.\nSIONA: I’ve read about that. But he is not the God of the desert.\nMONEO: Be quiet, you foolish girl! You Know nothing of such things.\nSIONA: | Know that you are a coward.\nMONEO: How little you know. You have never stood where | have stood and seen it in his eyes, in the movements of his hands.\nSIONA: What do you do when the Worm approaches?\nMONEO: | leave.\nSIONA: That’s prudent. He has killed nine Duncan Idahos that we know about for sure.\nMONEO: | tell you he kills no one!\nSIONA: What’s the difference? Leto or Worm, they are one body now.\nMONEO: But they are two separate beings—Leto the Emperor and The Worm Who Is God.\nSIONA: YOu’re mad!\nMONEO: Perhaps. But | do serve God.\nI am the most ardent people-watcher who ever lived. | watch them inside me and outside. Past and present can mingle with odd impositions in me.

It’s as though | sensed everything in close-up. | have extremely acute hearing and vision, plus a sense of smell extraordinarily discriminating. | can detect and identify pheromones at three parts per million. | know. | have tested it. You cannot hide very much from my senses. | think it would horrify you what | can detect by smell alone. Your pheromones tell me what you are doing or are prepared to do. And gesture and posture! | stared for half a day once at an old man sitting on a bench in Arrakeen. He was a fifth-generation descendant of Stilgar the Naib and did not even know it. | studied the angle of his neck, the skin flaps below his chin, the cracked lips and moistness about his nostrils, the pores behind his ears, the wisps of gray hair which crept from beneath the hood of his antique stillsuit. Not once did he detect that he was being watched. Hah! Stilgar would have known it in a second or two. But this old man was just waiting for someone who never came. He got up finally and tottered off. He was very stiff after all of that sitting. | knew | would never see him in the flesh again. He was that near death and his water was sure to be wasted. Well, that no longer mattered.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nBeas thought it the most interesting place in the universe, this place where he awaited the arrival of his current Duncan Idaho. By most human standards, it was a gigantic space, the core of an elaborate series of catacombs beneath his Citadel. Radiating chambers thirty meters high and twenty meters wide ran like spokes from the hub where he waited. His cart had been positioned at the center of the hub in a domed and circular chamber four hundred meters in diameter and one hundred meters high at its tallest point above him.\nHe found these dimensions reassuring.\nIt was early afternoon at the Citadel, but the only light in his chamber came from the random drifting of a few\nsuspensor-borne glowglobes tuned into low orange. The light did not penetrate far into the spokes, but Leto’s memories told him the exact position of everything there— the water, the bones, the dust of his ancestors and of the Atreides who had lived and died since the Dune times. All of them were here, plus a few containers of melange to create the illusion that this was all of his hoard should it ever come to such an extreme.\nLeto knew why the Duncan was coming. Idaho had learned that the Tleilaxu were making another Duncan, another ghola created to the specifications demanded by the God Emperor. This Duncan feared that he was being replaced after almost sixty years of service. It was always something of that nature which began the subversion of the Duncans. A Guild envoy had waited upon Leto earlier to warn that the Ixians had delivered a lasgun to this Duncan.\nLeto chuckled. The Guild remained extremely sensitive to anything which might threaten their slender supply of spice. They were terrified at the thought that Leto was the last link with the sandworms which had produced the original stockpiles of melange.\nIfI die away from water, there will be no more spice—not ever.\nThat was the Guild’s fear. And their historian-accountants assured them Leto sat on the largest store of melange in the universe. This knowledge made the Guild almost reliable as allies.\nWhile he waited, Leto did the hand and finger exercises of his Bene Gesserit inheritance. The hands were his pride. Beneath a gray membrane of sandtrout skin, their long digits and opposable thumbs could be used much as any human hands. The almost useless flippers which once had been his feet and legs were more inconvenience than shame. He could crawl, roll and toss his body with astonishing speed, but he sometimes fell on the flippers and there was pain.\nWhat was delaying the Duncan?\nLeto imagined the man vacillating, staring out a window across the fluid horizon of the Sareer. The air was alive with heat today. Before descending to the crypt, Leto had seen a mirage in the southwest. The heat-mirror tipped and flashed an image across the sand, showing him a band of Museum Fremen trudging past a Display Sietch for the edification of tourists.\nIt was cool in the crypt, always cool, the illumination always low. Tunnel spokes were dark holes sloping upward and downward in gentle gradients to accommodate the Royal Cart. Some tunnels extended beyond false walls for many kilometers, passages Leto had created for himself with Ixian tools—feeding tunnels and secret ways.\nAs he contemplated the coming interview, a sense of nervousness began to grow in Leto. He found this an interesting emotion, one", " and toss his body with astonishing speed, but he sometimes fell on the flippers and there was pain.\nWhat was delaying the Duncan?\nLeto imagined the man vacillating, staring out a window across the fluid horizon of the Sareer.

Some tunnels extended beyond false walls for many kilometers, passages Leto had created for himself with Ixian tools—feeding tunnels and secret ways.\nAs he contemplated the coming interview, a sense of nervousness began to grow in Leto. He found this an interesting emotion, one he had been known to enjoy. Leto knew that he had grown reasonably fond of the current Duncan. There was a reservoir of hope in Leto that the man would survive the coming interview. Sometimes they did. There was little likelihood the Duncan posed a mortal threat, although this had to be left to such chance as existed. Leto had tried to explain this to one of the earlier Duncans... right here in this room.\n“You will think it strange that I, with my powers, can speak of luck and chance,” Leto had said.\nThe Duncan had been angry. “You leave nothing to chance! | know you!”\n“How naive. Chance is the nature of our universe.”\n“Not chance! Mischief. And you’re the author of mischief!”\n“Excellent, Duncan! Mischief is a most profound pleasure. It’s in the ways we deal with mischief that we sharpen creativity.”\n“You're not even human anymore!” Oh, how angry the Duncan had been.\nLeto had found his accusation irritating, like a grain of sand in an eye. He held onto the remnants of his once- human self with a grimness which could not be denied, although irritation was the closest he could come to anger.\n“Your life is becoming a cliché,” Leto had accused.\nWhereupon the Duncan had produced a small explosive from the folds of his uniform robe. What a surprise!\nLeto loved surprises, even nasty ones.\nIt is something | did not predict! And he said as much to Duncan, who had stood there oddly undecided now that decision was absolutely demanded of him.\n“This could kill you,” the Duncan said.\n“I’m sorry, Duncan. It will do a small amount of injury, no more.”\n“But you said you didn’t predict this!” The Duncan’s voice had grown shrill.\n“Duncan, Duncan, it is absolute prediction which equals death to me. How unutterably boring death is.”\nAt the last instant, the Duncan had tried to throw the explosive to one side, but the material in it had been unstable and it had gone off too soon. The Duncan had died. Ahh, well—the Tleilaxu always had another in their axlotl tanks.\nOne of the drifting glowglobes above Leto began to blink. Excitement gripped him. Moneo’s signal! Faithful Moneo had alerted his God Emperor that the Duncan was descending to the crypt.\nThe door to the human lift between two spoked passages in the northwest arc of the hub swung open. The Duncan strode forth, a small figure at that distance, but Leto’s eyes discerned even tiny details—a wrinkle on the uniform elbow which said the man had been leaning somewhere, chin in hand. Yes, there were still the marks of his hand on the chin. The Duncan’s odor preceded him: the man was high on his own adrenalin.\nLeto remained silent while the Duncan approached, observing details. The Duncan still walked with the spring of youth despite all of his long service. He could thank a minimal ingestion of melange for that. The man wore the old Atreides uniform, black with a golden hawk at the left breast. An interesting statement, that: “I serve the honor of the o/d Atreides!” His hair was still the black cap of karakul, the features fixed in stony sharpness with high cheekbones.\nThe Tleilaxu make their gholas well, Leto thought.\nThe Duncan carried a thin briefcase woven of dark brown fibers, one he had carried for many years. It usually contained the material upon which he based his reports, but today it bulged with some heavier weight.\nThe Ixian lasgun.\nIdaho kept his attention on Leto’s face as he walked. The face remained disconcertingly Atreides, lean features with eyes of total blue which the nervous felt as a physical intrusion. It lurked deep within a gray cowl of sandtrout skin which, Idaho knew, could roll forward protectively ina flickering reflex—a faceblink rather than an eyeblink. The Skin was pink within its gray frame. It was difficult avoiding the thought that Leto’s face was an obscenity, a lost bit of humanity trapped in something alien.\nStopping only six paces from the Royal Cart, Idaho did not attempt to conceal his angry determination. He did not even think about whether Leto knew of the lasgun. This Imperium had wandered too far from the old Atreides morality, had become an impersonal juggernaut which crushed the innocent in its path. It had to be ended!\n“I have come to talk to you about Siona and other matters,” Idaho said. He brought the case into position where he could withdraw the lasgun easily.\n“Very well.” Leto’s voice was full of boredom.\n“Siona was the only one who escaped, but she still has a base of rebel companions.”\n“You think I don’t know this!”\n“I know your dangerous tolerance for rebels! What I don’t know is the contents of that package she stole.”\n“Oh, that. She has the complete plans for the Citadel.”\nFor just a moment, Idaho was Leto’s Guard Commander, deeply shocked at such a breach of security.\n“You let her escape with that?”\n“No, you did.”\nIdaho recoiled from this accusation. Slowly, the newly resolved assassin in him regained ascendancy.\n“Is that all she got?” Idaho asked.\n“I had two volumes, copies of my journal, in with the charts. She stole the copies.”\nIdaho studied Leto’s immobile face. “What is in these journals? Sometimes you say it’s a diary, sometimes a history.”\n“A bit of both. You might even call it a textbook.”\n“Does it bother you that she took these volumes?”\nLeto allowed himself a soft smile which Idaho accepted as a negative answer. A momentary tension rippled through Leto’s body then as Idaho reached into the slim case. Would it be the weapon or the reports? Although the core of his body possessed a powerful resistance to heat, Leto knew that some of his flesh was vulnerable to lasguns, especially the face.\nIdaho brought a report from his case and, even before he began reading from it, the signals were obvious to Leto. Idaho was seeking answers, not providing information. Idaho wanted justification for a course of action already chosen.\n“We have discovered a Cult of Alia on Giedi Prime,” Idaho said.\nLeto remained silent while Idaho recounted the details. How boring. Leto let his thoughts wander. The worshippers of his father’s long-dead sister served these days only to provide occasional amusement. The Duncans predictably Saw such activity as a kind of underground threat.\nIdaho finished reading. His agents were thorough, no denying it. Boringly thorough.\n“This is nothing more than a revival of Isis,” Leto said. “My priests and priestesses will have some sport suppressing this cult and its followers.”\nIdaho shook his head as though responding to a voice within it.\n“The Bene Gesserit knew about the cult,” he said.\nNow that interested Leto.\n“The Sisterhood has never forgiven me for taking their breeding program away from them,” he said.\n“This has nothing to do with breeding.”\nLeto concealed mild amusement. The Duncans were always so sensitive on the subject of breeding, although some of them occasionally stood at stud.\n“I see,” Leto said. “Well, the Bene Gesserit are all more than a little insane, but madness represents a chaotic reservoir of surprises. Some surprises can be valuable.”\n“Į fail to see any value in this.”\n“Do you think the Sisterhood was behind this cult?” Leto asked.\n“Ido.”\n“Explain.”\n“They had a shrine. They called it ‘The Shrine of the Crysknife.’”\n“Did they now?”\n“And their chief priestess was called ‘The Keeper of Jessica’s Light.’ Does that suggest anything?”\n“It’s lovely!” Leto did not try to conceal his amusement.\n“What is lovely about it?”\n“They unite my grandmother and my aunt into a single goddess.”\nIdaho shook his head slowly from side to side, not understanding.\nLeto permitted himself a small internal pause, less than a blink. The grandmother-within did not particularly care for\nthis Giedi Prime cult. He was required to wall off her memories and her identity.\n“What do you suppose was the purpose of this cult?” Leto asked.\n“Obvious. A competing religion to undermine your authority.”\n“That’s too simple. Whatever else they may be, the Bene Gesserit are not simpletons.”\nIdaho waited for an explanation.\n“They want more spice!” Leto said. “More Reverend Mothers.”\n“So they annoy you until you buy them off?”\n“lam disappointed in you, Duncan.”\nIdaho merely stared up at Leto, who contrived a sigh, a complicated gesture no longer intrinsic to his new form. The Duncans usually were brighter, but Leto supposed that this one’s plot had clouded his alertness.\n“They chose Giedi Prime as their home,” Leto said. “What does that suggest?”\n“It was a Harkonnen stronghold, but that’s ancient history.”\n“Your sister died there, a victim of the Harkonnens. It is right that the Harkonnens and Giedi Prime be united in your thoughts. Why did you not mention this earlier?”\n“I didn’t think it was important.”\nLeto drew his mouth into a tight line. The reference to his sister had troubled the Duncan. The man knew intellectually that he was only the latest in a long line of fleshly revivals, all products of the Tleilaxu axlotl tanks and taken from the Original cells at that. The Duncan could not escape his revived memories. He knew that the Atreides had rescued him from Harkonnen bondage.\nAnd whatever else I may be, Leto thought, / am still Atreides.\n“What're you trying to say?” Idaho demanded.\nLeto decided that a shout was required. He let it be a loud one: “The Harkonnens were spice hoarders!”\nIdaho recoiled a full step.\nLeto continued in a lower voice: “There’s an undiscovered melange hoard on Giedi Prime. The Sisterhood was trying to winkle it out with their religious tricks as a cover.”\nIdaho was abashed. Once it was spoken, the answer appeared obvious.\nAnd I missed it, he thought.\nLeto’s shout had shaken him back into his role as Commander of the Royal Guard. Idaho knew about the economics of the Empire, simplified in the extreme: no interest charges permitted; cash on the barrelhead. The only coinage bore a likeness of Leto’s cowled face: the God Emperor. But it was all based on the spice, a substance whose value, though enormous, kept increasing. A man could carry the price of an entire planet in his hand luggage.\n“Control the coinage and the courts. Let the rabble have the rest,”", "The Harkonnens were spice hoarders!”\nIdaho recoiled a full step.\nLeto continued in a lower voice: “There’s an undiscovered melange hoard on Giedi Prime. The Sisterhood was trying to winkle it out with their religious tricks as a cover.”\nIdaho was abashed.

A man could carry the price of an entire planet in his hand luggage.\n“Control the coinage and the courts. Let the rabble have the rest,” Leto thought. Old Jacob Broom said it and Leto could hear the old man chortling within. “Things haven't changed all that much, Jacob.”\nIdaho took a deep breath. “The Bureau of the Faith should be notified immediately.”\nLeto remained silent.\nTaking this as a cue to continue, Idaho went on with his reports, but Leto listened with only a fraction of his awareness. It was like a monitoring circuit which only recorded Idaho’s words and actions with but an occasional intensification for an internal comment:\nAnd now he wants to talk about the Tleilaxu.\nThat is dangerous ground for you, Duncan.\nBut this opened up a new avenue for Leto’s reflection.\nThe wily Tleilaxu still produce my Duncans from the original cells. They do a religiously forbidden thing and we both know it. | do not permit the artificial manipulation of human genetics. But the Tleilaxu have learned how |\ntreasure the Duncans as the Commanders of my Guard. | do not think they suspect the amusement value in this. It amuses me that a river now bears the Idaho name where once it was a mountain. That mountain no longer exists. We brought it down to get material for the high walls which girdle my Sareer.\nOf course, the Tleilaxu know that I occasionally breed the Duncans back into my own program. The Duncans represent mongrel strength... and much more. Every fire must have its damper.\nIt was my intent to breed this one with Siona, but that may not be possible now.\nHah! He says he wants me to “crack down” on the Tleilaxu. Why will he not ask it straight out? “Are you preparing to replace me?”\nlam tempted to tell him.\nOnce more, Idaho’s hand went into the slender pouch. Leto’s introspective monitoring did not miss a beat.\nThe lasgun or more reports? It is more reports.\nThe Duncan remains wary. He wants not only the assurance that | am ignorant of his intent but more “proofs” that I am unworthy of his loyalty. He hesitates in a prolonged fashion. He always has. | have told him enough times that I will not use my prescience to predict the moment of my exit from this ancient form. But he doubts. He always was a doubter.\nThis cavernous chamber drinks up his voice and, were it not for my sensitivity, the dankness here would mask the chemical evidence of his fears. | fade his voice out of immediate awareness. What a bore this Duncan has become. He is recounting the history, the history of Siona’s rebellion, no doubt leading up to personal admonitions about her latest escapade.\n“It’s not an ordinary rebellion,” he says.\nThat brings me back! Fool. All rebellions are ordinary and an ultimate bore. They are copied out of the same pattern,\none much like another. The driving force is adrenalin addiction and the desire to gain personal power. All rebels are Closet aristocrats. That’s why | can convert them so easily.\nWhy do the Duncans never really hear me when | tell them about this? | have had the argument with this very Duncan. It was one of our earliest confrontations and right here in the crypt.\n“The art of government requires that you never give up the initiative to radical elements,” he said.\nHow pedantic. Radicals crop up in every generation and you must not try to prevent this. That’s what he means by “give up the initiative.” He wants to crush them, suppress them, control them, prevent them. He is living proof that there is little difference between the police mind and the military mind.\n| told him, “Radicals are only to be feared when you try to suppress them. You must demonstrate that you will use the best of what they offer.”\n“They are dangerous. They are dangerous!” He thinks that by repeating he creates some kind of truth.\nSlowly, step by step, | lead him through my method and he even gives the appearance of listening.\n“This ts their weakness, Duncan. Radicals always see matters in terms which are too simple—black and white, good and evil, them and us. By addressing complex matters in that way, they rip open a passage for chaos. The art of government as you Call it, is the mastery of chaos.”\n“No one can deal with every surprise.”\n“Surprise? Who’s talking about surprise? Chaos is no surprise. It has predictable characteristics. For one thing, it carries away order and strengthens the forces at the extremes.”\n“Isn't that what radicals are trying to do? Aren’t they trying to shake things up so they can grab control?”\n“That’s what they think they’re doing. Actually, they’re creating new extremists, new radicals and they are continuing the old process.”\n“What about a radical who sees the complexities and comes at you that way?”\n“That’s no radical. That’s a rival for leadership.”\n“But what do you do?”\n“You co-opt them or kill them. That’s how the struggle for leadership originated, at the grunt level.”\n“Yes, but what about messiahs?”\n“Like my father?”\nThe Duncan does not like this question. He knows that in a very special way I am my father. He knows | can speak with my father’s voice and persona, that the memories are precise, never edited and inescapable.\nReluctantly, he says: “Well... if you want.”\n“Duncan, | am all of them and I know. There has never been a truly selfless rebel, just hypocrites—conscious hypocrites or unconscious hypocrites, it’s all the same.”\nThat stirs up a small hornet’s nest among my ancestral memories. Some of them have never given up the belief that they and they alone held the key to all of humankinad’s problems. Well, in that, they are like me. | can sympathize even while | tell them that failure is its own demonstration.\nl am forced to block them off, though. There’s no sense dwelling on them. They now are little more than poignant reminders... as is this Duncan who stands in front of me with his lasgun... .\nGreat Gods below! He has caught me napping. He has the lasgun in his hand and it is pointed at my face.\n“You, Duncan? Have you betrayed me, too?”\nEt tu, Brute?\nEvery fiber of Leto’s awareness came to full alert. He could feel his body twitching. The worm-flesh had a will of its own.\nIdaho spoke with derision: “Tell me, Leto: How many times must | pay the debt of loyalty?”\nLeto recognized the inner question: “How many of me have there been?” The Duncans always wanted to know this. Every Duncan asked it and no answer satisfied. They doubted.\nIn his saddest Muad’Dib voice, Leto asked: “Do you take no pride in my admiration, Duncan? Haven’t you ever wondered what it is about you that makes me desire you as my constant companion through the centuries?”\n“You know me to be the ultimate fool!”\n“Duncan!”\nThe voice of an angry Muad’Dib could always be counted on to shatter Idaho. Despite the fact that Idaho knew no Bene Gesserit had ever mastered the powers of Voice as Leto had mastered them, it was predictable that he would dance to this one voice. The lasgun wavered in his hand.\nThat was enough. Leto was off the cart in a hurtling roll. Idaho had never seen him leave the cart this way, had not even suspected it could happen. For Leto, there were only two requirements—a real threat which the worm-body could sense and the release of that body. The rest was automatic and the speed of it always astonished even Leto.\nThe lasgun was his major concern. It could scratch him badly, but few understood the abilities of the pre-worm body to deal with heat.\nLeto struck Idaho while rolling and the lasgun was deflected as it was fired. One of the useless flippers which had been Leto’s legs and feet sent a shocking burst of sensations crashing into his awareness. For an instant, there was only pain. But the worm-body was free to act and reflexes ignited a violent paroxysm of flopping. Leto heard bones cracking. The lasgun was thrown far across the floor of the crypt by a spasmodic jerk of Idaho’s hand.\nRolling off of Idaho, Leto poised himself for a renewed attack but there was no need. The injured flipper still sent\npain signals and he sensed that the tip of the flipper had been burned away. The sandtrout skin already had sealed the wound. The pain had eased to an ugly throbbing.\nIdaho stirred. There could be little doubt that he had been mortally injured. His chest was visibly crushed. There was obvious agony when he tried to breathe, but he opened his eyes and stared up at Leto.\nThe persistence of these mortal possessions! Leto thought.\n“Siona,” Idaho gasped.\nLeto saw the life leave him then.\nInteresting, Leto thought. /s it possible that this Duncan and Siona... No! This Duncan always displayed a true sneering disdain for Siona’s foolishness.\nLeto climbed back onto the Royal Cart. That had been a close one. There could be little doubt that the Duncan had been aiming for the brain. Leto was always aware that his hands and feet were vulnerable, but he had allowed no one to learn that what had once been his brain was no longer directly associated with his face. It was not even a brain of human dimensions anymore, but had spread in nodal congeries throughout his body. He had told this to no one but his journals.\nOh, the landscapes | have seen! And the people! The far wanderings of the Fremen and all the rest of it. Even back through the myths to Terra. Oh, the lessons in astronomy and intrigue, the migrations, the disheveled flights, the leg-aching and lung-aching runs through so many nights on all of those cosmic specks where we have defended our transient possession. | tell you we are a marvel and my memories leave no doubt of this.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe woman working at the small wall desk was too big for\nthe narrow chair on which she perched. Outside, it was mid-morning, but in this windowless room deep beneath the city of Onn there was but a single glowglobe high ina corner. It had been tuned to warm yellow but the light failed to dispel the gray utility of the small room. Walls and ceiling were covered by identical rectangular panels of dull gray metal.\nThere was only one other piece of furniture, a narrow cot with a thin pallet covered by a featureless gray blanket.
