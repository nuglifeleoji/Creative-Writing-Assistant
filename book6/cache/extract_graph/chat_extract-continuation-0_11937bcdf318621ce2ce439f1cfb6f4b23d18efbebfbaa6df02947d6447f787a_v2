“你应该知道原因吧，你总是能轻易看到我的思想，有时候看得比我还透彻，经你提醒，我才知道自己真正想的是什么。”\n　　章北海转身直视着吴岳：“对于投身于一场注定要失败的战争，你感到悲哀。\n　　你很羡慕最后的那一代太空军，在年轻时就能战斗到最后，与舰队一起埋葬在太空。但把一生的心血耗尽在这样一个毫无希望的事业上，对你来说确实很难。“\n　　“有什么要劝我的吗？”\n　　“没有，技术崇拜和技术制胜论在你的思想中是根深蒂固的，我早就知道改变不了体，只能尽力降低这种思想对工作造成的损害。另外，对这场战争，我并不认为人类的胜利是不可能的。”\n　　吴岳这时放下了冷漠的面具，迎接着章北海的目光：“北海，你以前曾经是一个很现实的人，你反对建造‘唐’号，曾经多次在正式场合对建立远洋海军的理念提出过质疑，认为它与国力不相符，你认为我们的海上力量应该在近海随时处于岸基火力的支援和保护之下，这种想法被少壮派们骂为乌龟战略，但你一直坚持……那么现在，你对这场星际战争的必胜信念是从哪儿来的，你真的认为小木船能击沉航空母舰？”\n　　“建国初期，刚刚成立的海军用木船击沉过国民党的驱逐舰；更早些，我军也有骑兵击败坦克群的战例。”\n　　“你不至于把这些传奇上升为正常、普适的军事理论吧。”\n　　“在这场战争中，地球文明不需要正常的普适的军事理论，一次例外就够了。”章北海朝吴岳竖起一根手指。\n　　吴岳露出讥讽的笑：“我想听听你怎么实现这次例外？”\n　　“我当然不懂太空战争，但如果你把它类比为小木船对航母的话，那我认为只要有行动的胆略和必胜的信心，前者真的有可能击沉后者。木船载上一支潜水员小分队，埋伏在航母经过的航道上，当敌舰驶至一定距离时，潜水分队下水，木船驶离，当航母驶过潜水分队上方时，他们将炸弹安置在船底……当然这做起来极其困难，但并非不可能。”\n　　吴岳点点头，“不错，有人试过的，二战中英国人为了击沉德军提尔匹兹号战列舰这么干过，只不过用的是一艘微型潜艇；上世纪八十年代，在马岛战争时期，有几个阿根廷特种兵带着磁性水雷潜人意大利。企图从水下炸沉停泊在巷口的英国军舰。不过结果你也都知道。”\n　　“但我们有的不止是小木船，一枚一千至两千吨级的核弹完全可以制成一两名潜水员能够在水下携带的大小，如果把它贴到航母的船底，那就不止是击沉它，最大的航母\n######################\nOutput:",
