As the class leader, he has achieved a high level of soul power and is considered one of the top students in his class. At just nine years old, he is one of the oldest students, demonstrating significant power and determination, particularly in competitive settings such as the final exam, where he notably became a two-ring soul master.\n\nIn the context of the tournament, 吕千寻 plays a crucial role in strategizing alongside 常剑逸, preparing for upcoming battles and assessments. He is a member of 叶灵瞳's group, contributing to their top performance in class assessments and showcasing his strength as a competitor. His combat skills are highlighted during encounters, including an attempt to attack 蓝轩宇, which is interrupted by the dragon's roar, illustrating the challenges he faces in battle scenarios.\n\n吕千寻 is characterized by his protective nature, particularly in his interactions with classmates like 叶灵瞳 and 蓝轩宇. He mediates conflicts, such as the one between 蓝轩宇 and 金翔, suggesting resolutions and encouraging camaraderie among peers. His supportive actions extend to assisting 金翔 after a confrontation, demonstrating his leadership and concern for his classmates.\n\nIn addition to his combat prowess, 吕千寻 has achieved notable records in physical tests, including the longest time in the strength test, where he recorded two minutes and thirty-two seconds.
