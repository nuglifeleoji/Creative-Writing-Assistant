\n　　众人在这时当然不能象在自己地里干活，可以随便晚出早归，得象以前的生产队一样，天明出工，天黑收工。 \n　　后半晌，那些从自己地里早归的村民，都不由纷纷串到这里来，蹲在砖场周围，观看少安的红火场面，在这些旁观者中间，有时也能看见我们的孙玉亭同志。 \n　　热爱集体场面似乎是玉亭的天性。尽管他也知道，这场面和当年的农田基建大会战屁不相干，但几年来他终归又看见了一群人凑到一块劳动的场面，不能不使他触景生情，唏嘘感叹。有时候，在这纷乱的人头上空，他恍惚看见一面面红旗在风中招展……别了，往日那火红的岁月！ \n　　孙玉亭蹲在侄儿的砖场边，吸着从他哥烟布袋里挖来的旱烟，心绪烦乱地思前想后，不时用手指头把流在嘴唇的清鼻涕抹在他的破鞋帮子上。世事变了，他还是一副穷酸相，一身破烂衣服，胸前的钮扣还是缺三掉四，旱烟照样由他哥供应。要不是大女儿卫红已长成个懂事姑娘，相帮这对“革命夫妻”种地，一家五口人恐怕连口也糊不住。这不，凤英现在也只好投在“资本主义”门下，赚几个“下眼”钱。 \n　　玉亭不仅光景没变，其它“爱好”也没变。他一直不间断地到小学教师金成那里取来报纸，抢着赶天黑看完（晚上他点不起灯），如此关心“政治”的人，至少在东拉河一带的农村实属罕见！ \n　　由于玉亭经常看报，因此在任何时候都很了解“目前形势”。 \n　　当侄儿扩建后的砖场装起第一窑砖坯的时候，对“目前形势”很了解的孙玉亭，忍不住给侄儿出了个“点子”。他对少安说：“目前报纸上正宣传帮穷扶贫的万元户哩！你比他们报纸上宣扬的那些人都突出！因此，你要叫人知道你的光荣事迹哩！” \n　　“怎？咱自己给报纸上写稿子表扬自己？”少安笑着对一本正经的二爸说。 \n　　“还要咱自己写？只要你闹腾一番，他上面的人抢着报道哩！”孙玉亭嘴一撇，惊奇办大事业的侄儿竟然如此缺乏“政治头脑”。 \n　　“你说怎闹腾哩？”少安仍不明白他二爸的意思。“嗨！这有什么难的？你干脆弄个隆重的点火仪式，给乡上和县上的机关发出请贴，让他们都来参加。你破费一点钱，办几桌酒席，晚上再包一场电影，把气氛造得轰轰烈烈。你现在又不是出不起这两个钱？再说，钱是小\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
