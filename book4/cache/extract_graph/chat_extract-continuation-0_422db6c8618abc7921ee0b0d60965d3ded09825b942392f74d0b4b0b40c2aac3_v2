车站去。村里的人几乎都来送她了。媳妇们和老婆婆们争相拉着她的手。抚摸她。学校的孩子们舍不得吴老师，一个个哭得眼泪汪汪的。吴月琴把运生媳妇怀里的娃娃亲了又亲，然后伏在运生妈妈的胸前哭了。运生妈妈抚摸着她的关发，老泪也像断了线的珠子往下淌。 \n　　冯国斌走不进入圈里，站在门台上吧吧地抽着旱烟，握烟锅的手在微微颤抖着。 \n　　吴月琴看见了他，快步跑过去。 \n　　她站在他面前，脸上挂着泪珠，笑盈盈地看着了。她从黄书包里抽出一个封着的纸卷，双手递到他面前，说：“老冯，这送您留个纪念吧！您还记得两年前我给您念过的一首儿歌吗？您一定记得！我就是根据那首歌的意境画了这张国画。多年不画，手笨得要命。画得不好，您不要嫌！这是我的一点心意。” \n　　冯国斌接过这卷画，厚厚的嘴唇动了动，想说什么，却什么也没说出来。他满怀厚爱地瞥了她一眼，像父亲对出远门的孩子那样嘱咐她：“路上多加小心，别感冒了；到了北京不要忘了给我写信。” \n　　“一定。” \n　　“好，再见。” \n　　他伸出粗大的手握了握她的手，便匆匆转身走回自己的房子。吴月琴心中猜：他大概是不愿亲眼看见她走——这些事上，也表现出他那特殊的脾气！她深沉地望了一眼他所住的那间房子，便向拖拉机那边跑去了。 \n　　冯国斌回到屋子，背抄着手一动也不动地伫立在窗前。他听见拖拉机发动了，走了，远了……现在，他打开那张画，小心翼翼地把它贴在自己的办公桌旁边，然后退后几步，点着一锅烟抽着，长久地盯着这幅画：苍劲的青松，挺拢在蓝天白云之中；树下一朵小小的红花，开得正艳。画的左侧，秀丽的草书竖写着一行字：青松与小红花。 \n                  第23章\n　　田晓霞静静地立在黄原地委门口，一直目送着孙少平的背影消失在北大街的尽头。 \n　　暮色已经临近，满城亮起了耀眼的灯火。不远处的电影院刚刚散场，清冷的街道顿时出现了喧闹。嘈杂的人群散乱地流向东西南北，街巷中自行车的铃声响个不停。 \n　　片刻功夫，大街上重新安静了。雨已停歇，满天破碎的云彩象溃退的队伍似的在暗夜中向南逃遁。四面的群山只能模糊地分辨出一些轮廓。 \n　　田晓霞心绪极其纷乱，一时无心回家去。 \n　　她索性离开地委大门口，来到了街\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>吴月琴<|>PERSON<|>吴月琴 is a character who is leaving her
