Firstly, it refers to the casualties that emerged from a battle, underscoring the severity and brutality of the conflict. This aspect highlights the human cost of warfare, emphasizing the loss of life and the impact on families and communities affected by such violence.\n\nSecondly, \"\"死尸\"\" is associated with a specific incident involving the discovery of two corpses by the figure 管辂 (Guan Lu) during a divination process intended for 王基 (Wang Ji). This discovery is intricately linked to the ailments afflicting 王基's family, suggesting a deeper, possibly supernatural or symbolic connection between the dead and the living. The presence of these corpses in the context of divination implies that they may hold significance in understanding or resolving the misfortunes faced by 王基's family.\n\nIn summary, \"\"死尸\"\" serves as a poignant reminder of both the tragic outcomes of conflict and the personal ramifications of death within familial contexts. It reflects the dual nature of mortality—both as a result of external violence and as a catalyst for introspection and divination in the face of personal suffering.\",2\n469,军马,\"The term \"\"军马\"\" refers to the military forces, particularly cavalry, involved in various significant military movements and conflicts. This includes the arrival of troops, which signals a notable military mobilization and the potential for conflict.

The term encompasses not only the cavalry forces but also the broader military contingents mobilized by key figures such as 孔明 and his allies during their campaigns against the 南蛮. These campaigns illustrate the strategic importance of \"\"军马\"\" in executing military operations and responding to threats.\n\nOverall, \"\"军马\"\" embodies the essence of military readiness and the tactical maneuvers that define the conflicts in which these forces are engaged, reflecting the complexities of warfare during this tumultuous period.\",7\n2510,喊声,\"喊声 refers to the shouts and cries during the battle, indicating the intensity of the conflict.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3743,管辂,死尸,\"管辂 identifies the two dead bodies during his divination for 王基, establishing a direct relationship\",19\n4580,军马,死尸,死尸 are the casualties resulting from the conflict involving the military forces,9\n4581,军马,喊声,喊声 reflects the intensity of the battle involving the military forces,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
