却说王含、蒋斌因立寨未定，恐魏兵来劫寨，不敢解甲而寝。忽闻中军大乱，急绰兵器上的马时，寨外邓忠引兵杀到。内外夹攻，王、蒋二将奋死抵敌不住，弃寨而走。姜维在帐中听得左寨中大喊，料道有内应外合之兵，遂急上马，立于中军帐前，传令曰：“如有妄动者斩！便有敌兵到营边，休要问他，只管以弓弩射之！”一面传示右营，亦不许妄动。果然魏兵十余次冲击，皆被射回。只冲杀到天明，魏兵不敢杀入。邓艾收兵回寨，乃叹曰：“姜维深得孔明之法！兵在夜而不惊，将闻变而不乱：真将才也！”次日，王含、蒋斌收聚败兵，伏于大寨前请罪。维曰：“非汝等之罪，乃吾不明地脉之故也，”又拨军马，令二将安营讫。却将伤死身尸，填于地道之中，以土掩之。令人下战书单搦邓艾来日交锋。艾忻然应之。次日，两军列于祁山之前。维按武侯八阵之法，依天、地、风、云、鸟、蛇、龙、虎之形，分布已定。邓艾出马，见维布成八卦，乃亦布之，左右前后，门户一般。维持枪纵马大叫曰：“汝效吾排八阵，亦能变阵否？”艾笑曰：“汝道此阵只汝能布耶？吾既会布阵，岂不知变阵！”艾便勒马入阵，令执法官把旗左右招飐，变成八八六十四个门户；复出阵前曰：“吾变法若何？”维曰：“虽然不差，汝敢与吾八阵相围么？”艾曰：“有何不敢！”两军各依队伍而进。艾在中军调遣。两军冲突，阵法不曾错动。姜维到中间，把旗一招，忽然变成长蛇卷地阵，将邓艾困在垓心，四面喊声大震。艾不知其阵，心中大惊。蜀兵渐渐逼近，艾引众将冲突不出。只听得蜀兵齐叫曰：“邓艾早降！”艾仰天长叹曰：“我一时自逞其能，中姜维之计矣！”忽然西北角上一彪军杀入，艾见是魏兵，遂乘势杀出。救邓艾者，乃司马望也。比及救出邓艾时，祁山九寨，皆被蜀兵所夺。艾引败兵，退于渭水南下寨。艾谓望曰：“公何以知此阵法而救出我也？”望曰：“吾幼年游学于荆南，曾与崔州平、石广元为友，讲论此阵。今日姜维所变者，乃长蛇卷地阵也。若他处击之，必不可破。\n######################\nOutput:",
