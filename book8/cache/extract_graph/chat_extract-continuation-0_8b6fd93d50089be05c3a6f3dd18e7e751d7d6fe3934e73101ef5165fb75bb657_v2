“哦。”对于丈夫，南澄是有着盲目信任的。\n\n    可是，当蓝轩宇吃到第八份牛排的时候，南澄还是坚决不肯再做了，家里也确实没有食材了。\n\n    “不能再吃了，吃的也太多了，撑坏了就麻烦了啊！”南澄有些急切的向蓝潇说道。\n\n    蓝潇向蓝轩宇道：“儿子，你还饿吗？”\n\n    蓝轩宇摸了摸肚子，道：“好像好一点了爸爸。但还是没吃饱。”\n\n    蓝潇道：“那咱们缓一缓再吃好不好？爸爸要问你点事情。”\n\n    “好吧。”\n\n    南澄有些不解的看了丈夫一眼，蓝潇道：“你们都跟我到修炼室来。”\n\n    一家三口来到家里的修炼室，蓝潇关好门，开启防护罩，揉了揉儿子的头发，“轩宇，爸爸听你叶锋叔叔说，你在晕倒之前曾经释放过冰盾？那你能不能再给爸爸、妈妈释放一个看看啊？”\n\n    “啊？我不知道啊！我没有释放冰盾啊！”蓝轩宇有些呆滞的道。\n\n    蓝潇道：“那你看看这个。”一边说着，他按动自己手腕上的魂导通讯器，一道光束被投射到修炼室的墙壁上，清晰的画面出现。\n\n    画面里，正是当时叶锋蹲在蓝轩宇面前，查看他蓝银草时的情况。\n\n    所有的修炼室都会安装有监控设备，方便查看练习的情况。\n\n    蓝潇先前显然已经看过了，南澄却还是第一次看。\n\n    画面中，叶锋触摸银纹蓝银草，蓝轩宇被他下意识释放出的武魂震飞。但在那一瞬间，蓝轩宇的双眸之中，分明有淡淡的光芒闪过，那是一种非常奇特的光彩，很淡，但却似乎是彩色的。\n\n    然后最引人瞩目的就是他左手的蓝银草草叶突然倒卷，卷住蓝轩宇的手掌，让他的手掌都变成了有着银色花纹的漂亮银色，冰盾随之出现，虽然下一瞬就破碎了，可它确实是真正出现过的。\n\n    蓝轩宇瞪大了眼睛看着这一切，再看看自己的左手，大眼睛中充满了不敢置信，然后就雀跃着叫道：“妈妈，我真的能凝水成冰了吗？那我试试。”\n\n    一边说着，他就把自己左手的蓝银草释放了出来。这次，一切似乎真的变得不一样了。\n\n    当蓝银草出现那一瞬间，蓝轩宇只觉得这蓝银草感觉上是那么的亲切，尤其是上面原本只是若有若无的银色花纹已经变得清晰起来，一道道丝丝缕缕的，与蓝银草的叶脉相互\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝潇<|>PERSON<|>蓝潇 is a
