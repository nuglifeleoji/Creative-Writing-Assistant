Had the Harkonnens changed in the centuries after his death? Duncan found this hard to believe. These words were things that the builders probably had thought appropriate.\nHe felt rather than heard Lucilla enter the room behind him. Duncan stood and fastened the clips of the tunic he had appropriated from the nullentropy bins (but only after removing all Harkonnen insignia!).\nWithout turning, he said: “What now, Lucilla?”\nShe stroked the fabric of the tunic along his left arm. “The Harkonnens had rich tastes.”\nDuncan spoke quietly: “Lucilla, if you touch me again without my permission, | will try to kill you. | will try so hard that you very likely will have to kill me.”\nShe recoiled.\nHe stared into her eyes. “I am not some damned stud for the witches!”\n“Is that what you think we want of you?”\n“Nobody has said what you want of me but your actions are obvious!”\nHe stood poised on the balls of his feet. The unawakened thing within him stirred and sent his pulse racing.\nLucilla studied him carefully. Damn that Miles Teg! She had not expected resistance to take this form. There was no doubting Duncan’s sincerity. Words by themselves no longer would serve. He was immune to Voice.\nTruth.\nIt was the only weapon left to her.\n“Duncan, | do not know precisely what it is Taraza expects you to do on Rakis. | can guess but my guess may be wrong.”\n“Guess, then.”\n“There is a young girl on Rakis, barely into her teens. Her name is Sheeana. The worms of Rakis obey her. Somehow, the Sisterhood must gather this talent into its own store of abilities.”\n“What could I possibly...”\n“If | knew, | certainly would tell you now.”\nHe heard her sincerity unmasked by her desperation.\n“What does your ta/ent have to do with this?” he demanded.\n“Only Taraza and her councillors know.”\n“They want some hold on me, something from which | Cannot escape!”\nLucilla already had arrived at this deduction but she had not expected him to see it that quickly. Duncan’s youthful face concealed a mind that worked in ways she had not yet fathomed. Lucilla’s thoughts raced.\n“Control the worms and you could revive the old religion.” It was Teg’s voice from the doorway behind Lucilla.\n| did not hear him arrive!\nShe whirled. Teg stood there with one of the antique Harkonnen lasguns held casually across his left arm, its muzzle directed at her.\n“This is to insure that you listen to me,” he said.\n“How long have you been there listening?”\nHer angry glare did not change his expression.\n“From the moment you admitted you don’t know what Taraza expects of Duncan,” Teg said. “Nor do |. But | can make a few Mentat projections—nothing firm yet but all of them suggestive. Tell me if | am wrong.”\n“About what?”\nHe glanced at Duncan. “One of the things you were told to do was to make him irresistible to most women.”\nLucilla tried to conceal her dismay. Taraza had warned her to conceal this from Teg as long as possible. She saw that concealment no longer was possible. Teg had read her reaction with those damnable abilities imparted to him by his damnable mother!\n“A great deal of energy is being gathered and aimed at Rakis,” Teg said. He looked steadily at Duncan. “No matter what the Tleilaxu have buried in him, he has the stamp of ancient humankind in his genes. Is that what the Breeding Mistresses need?”\n“A damned Bene Gesserit stud!” Duncan said.\n“What do you intend to do with that weapon?” Lucilla asked. She nodded at the antique lasgun in Teg’s hands.\n“This? | didn’t even put a charge cartridge in it.” He lowered the lasgun and leaned it into a corner beside him.\n“Miles Teg, you will be punished!” Lucilla grated.\n“That will have to wait,” he said. “It’s almost night outside. I’ve been out there under the life-shield. Burzmali has been here. He has left his sign to tell me he read the message | scratched with those animal marks on the trees.”\nA glittering alertness came into Duncan’s eyes.\n“What will you do?” Lucilla asked.\n“I have left new marks arranging a rendezvous. Right now, we are all going up to the library. We are going to study the maps. We will commit them to memory. At the very least, we should know where we are when we run.”\nShe gave him the benefit of a curt nod.\nDuncan noted her movement with only part of his awareness. His mind already had leaped ahead to the ancient equipment in the Harkonnen library. He had been the one to show both Lucilla and Teg how to use it correctly, calling up an ancient map of Giedi Prime dating from the time when the no-globe had been built.\nWith Duncan's pre-ghola memory as guide and his own more modern knowledge of the planet, Teg had tried to bring the map up to date.\n“Forest Guard Station” became “Bene Gesserit Keep.”\n“Part of it was a Harkonnen hunting lodge,” Duncan had said. “They hunted human game raised and conditioned specifically for that purpose.”\nTowns vanished under Teg’s updating. Some cities remained but received new labels. “Ysai,” the nearest metropolis, had been marked “Barony” on the original map.\nDuncan’s eyes went hard in memory. “That’s where they tortured me.”\nWhen Teg exhausted his memory of the planet, much was marked unknown but there were frequent curly-ended Bene Gesserit symbols to identify the places where Taraza’s people had told Teg he might find temporary sanctuary.\nThose were the places Teg wanted committed to memory.\nAs he turned to lead them up to the library, Teg said: “| will erase the map when we have learned it. There’s no telling who might find this place and study it.”\nLucilla swept past him. “It’s on your head, Miles!” she said.\nTeg called after her retreating back: “A Mentat tells you that | did what was required of me.”\nShe spoke without turning: “How logical!”\nThis room reconstructs a bit of the desert of Dune. The sandcrawler directly in front of you dates from the Atreides times. Grouped around it, moving clockwise from your left, are a small harvester, a carryall, a primitive spice factory and the other support equipment. All are explained at each station. Note the illuminated quotation above the display: “FOR THEY SHALL SUCK OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SEAS AND OF THE TREASURE IN THE SAND.” This ancient religious quotation was oft repeated by the famous Gurney Halleck.\n—GUIDE ANNOUNCEMENT, MUSEUM OF DAR-ES-BALAT\nhe worm did not slow its relentless progress until just\nbefore dusk. By then, Odrade had played out her questions and still had no answers. How did Sheeana control the worms? Sheeana said she was not steering her Shaitan in this direction. What was this hidden language to which the desert monster responded? Odrade knew that her Sister- guardians up there in the ’thopters that paced them would be exhausting the same questions plus one more.\nWhy did Odrade let this ride continue?\nThey might even hazard a few guesses: She does not call us in because that might disturb the beast. She does not trust us to pluck her party from its back.\nThe truth was far simpler: curiosity.\nThe hissing passage of the worm could have been a Surging vessel breasting seas. The dry flinty odors of overheated sand, swept across them by a following wind, said otherwise. Only open desert stretched around them now, kilometer after kilometer of whaleback dunes as regular in their spacing as ocean waves.\nWaff had been silent for a long period. He crouched ina miniature reproduction of Odrade’s position, his attention\ndirected ahead, a blank expression on his face. His most recent statement:\n“God guard the faithful in the hour of our trial!”\nOdrade thought of him as living proof that a strong enough fanaticism could endure for ages. Zensunni and the old Sufi survived in the Tleilaxu. It was like a deadly microbe that had lain dormant all of those millennia, waiting for the right host to feed its virulence.\nWhat will happen to the thing I planted in the Rakian priesthood? she wondered. Saint Sheeana was a certainty.\nSheeana sat on a ring of her Shaitan, her robe pulled up to expose her thin shanks. She gripped the ring with both hands between her legs.\nShe had said that her first worm ride went directly to the city of Keen. Why there? Had the worm simply been taking her to her own kind?\nThis one beneath them now certainly had a different goal. Sheeana no longer questioned but then Odrade had ordered her to remain silent and practice the low trance. That, at least, would assure that every last detail of this experience could be recalled easily from her memory. If there were a hidden language between Sheeana and worm, they would find it later.\nOdrade peered at the horizon. The remnant base of the ancient wall around the Sareer was only a few kilometers ahead. Long shadows from it lay across the dunes, telling Odrade that the remnant was higher than she had originally suspected. It was a shattered and broken outline now, with great boulders strewn along its base. The notch where the Tyrant had tumbled from his bridge into the Idaho River lay well to their right, at least three kilometers off their path. No river flowed there now.\nWaff stirred beside her. “I heed Thy call, God,” he said. “It is Waff of the Entio who prays in Thy Holy Place.”\nOdrade swiveled her gaze toward him without moving her head. Entio? Her Other Memories knew an Entio, a tribal\nleader in the great Zensunni Wandering, long before Dune. What was this? What ancient memories did these Tleilaxu keep alive?\nSheeana broke her silence. “Shaitan is slowing.”\nThe remains of the ancient wall blocked their way. It loomed at least fifty meters over the highest dunes. The worm turned slightly to the right and moved between two giant boulders that towered above them. It came to a stop. The long ridged back lay parallel to a mostly intact section of the wall’s base.\nSheeana stood and looked at the barrier.\n“What is this place?” Waff asked. He raised his voice above the sound of the ’thopters circling overhead.\nOdrade released her tiring grip and flexed her fingers. She continued to kneel while she studied their surroundings. Shadows from the tumbled boulders drew hard lines on sand spills and smaller rocks. Seen close up, not twenty meters away, the wall revealed cracks and fissures, dark openings into the ancient foundation.\nWaff stood and massaged his hands.\n“Why have we been brought here?” he asked. His voice was faintly plaintive.\nThe worm twitched.\n“Shaitan wants us to get\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b78bf262e83d99fc2f88a5f80ea9f97fcc3dd4052ebaae203c4f67de3bbb855b_v2"}
