至想过，自己应该远离乐公子，去找自己的生活。可是，每当她真的打算付出行动的时候，脑海中就会不自觉的浮现出这位乐公子无敌帅气的面庞，然后就会像泄了气的皮球一般，老老实实的回到他身边。这才是她最无奈也是最郁闷的事情。\n\n    先做好他的经纪人吧。等都做好了，说不定以后就能找到一个接替自己的人。\n\n    “没事啊！”乐公子轻声回答着。\n\n    他脸上带着淡淡的微笑，只是那分明是礼貌的笑容。每个他的歌迷都会觉得他和煦的平易近人，没有丝毫的骄矜之气。可乐卿灵却知道，这不过是他的外表。而他的内心世界究竟是什么样的，根本没人知道，或者说，失忆的他是不是就没有内心世界啊！\n\n    “第一场演唱会在明天晚上，今天你就好好休息吧。”\n\n    “好。”\n\n    ……\n------------\n\n第七十一章

他仿佛是从天空向下俯瞰，下方云雾飘渺，而在那缥缈的云雾之中，一座座岛屿竟是悬浮在空中，奇异而绚丽。\n\n    而就在周围，许多长得奇奇怪怪的生物围绕在身边。他自己看不到自己是什么样子，只能隐约看到淡淡的彩色光晕似乎是在从自己这边向外散发。而在自己身边这些长相奇怪的存在，很多身长都在百米以上。\n\n    那是龙吗？他吃惊的看看身边种类最多的生物。它们一个个体型修长、巨大，腹下有爪，似乎和传说中的巨龙很像。可是，这也太多了吧，至少有成百上千的巨龙，而且还有许许多多和巨龙体型不相上下的巨兽。\n\n    他感觉不到这些巨兽的气息，也听不到声音。而下一瞬，这些巨兽就都朝着下方的云雾之中扑去。\n\n    而下方，各种彩色光芒也随之升起，一个个人类如同雨后春笋一般浮现出来，他们的身体也都是巨大的，手持各种武器，竟是和那些巨兽们杀在了一处。\n\n    光影突然变得虚幻起来，让蓝轩宇有些无法看的清楚，但他却感受到了一个情绪，一个充满悲怆、愤怒的情绪，还有一声无比嘹亮的龙吟声。\n\n    不知道过了多长时间，突然，眼前的虚幻重新变得清晰起来，一道血红色的光芒却已经到了近前。\n\n
