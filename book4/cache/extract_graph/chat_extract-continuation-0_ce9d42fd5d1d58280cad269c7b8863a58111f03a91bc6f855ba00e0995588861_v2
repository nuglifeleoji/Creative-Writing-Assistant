\n　　“你这次到原北县是故地重游，一定有不少感慨吧！”田福军对黑老说。 \n　　“也许这是最后一次了。”黑白脸上露出一丝艺术家的忧伤。“这次到原北跑了一趟，是有不少感慨。不瞒你说，也有点难过！” \n　　田福军一怔。他没有言传，等待黑老继续说下去。“我没想到，农村已经成了这个样子！”黑白两手一摊，脸上的忧伤变成了痛苦。“完全是一派旧社会的景象嘛！集体连个影子也不见了。大家各顾各的光景，谁也不管谁的死活。过去一些不务正业的人在发财，而有的困难户却没有集体的关怀，日子很难过下去。农村已经出现了严重的两级分化，队干部中的积极分子也都埋头发家致富去了；我们在农村搞了几十年社会主义，结果不费吹灰之力就荡然无存……” \n　　黑白的一番话使田福军一时不知该如何对答。老朋友给他描绘了一幅多么可怕的图景！田福军原来以为，作家的思想是应该能够站在时代前列的；想不到黑白同志竟然比最保守的基层干部都要更不理解农村的改革。仅从这一点看，改革就是一件多么艰难的事啊！ \n　　田福军一边诚心地听黑老说话，一边赶紧把那些吃的东西往他旁边挪。聪敏的润叶为了缓解气氛，也热情招呼敛声屏气的杜正贤和贾冰吃东西。 \n　　田福军把几颗大红枣塞在黑老手里，脸上堆着笑容，说：“你说的这些现象的确存在。可是，农村既然发生了这么重大的变化，出现问题也是不可避免的。你熟悉历史，古今中外任何大的社会变革，都不可避免要出现各种各样的问题。但我们还是要从最主要的方面来看这种变革是否利大于弊……” \n　　接着，田福军用一系列数字给黑老列举了农村改革前后的状况——这是对黑老最有说服力的回答。 \n　　黑白听得渐渐咧开了嘴巴。他说：“你说的也许都是事实，可是我思想上很难转这个弯啊！”黑白大概也觉得谈话过分严肃了一些，脸上露出了笑容，“你想想，自己一生倾注了心血而热情赞美的事物，突然被否定得一干二净，心里不难过是不可能的！” \n　　田福军理解黑老的心情。黑老在很大程度上说的是他那部长篇小说《太阳正当头》。这本描写合作化运动和大跃进的书，是他一生的代表作。他在其间真诚地讴歌的事物，现在看来很多方面已经站不住脚；甚至是幼稚和可笑的。作家当年力图展现正剧，没想到他自己却成了悲剧。 \n　　田福军带着某种安慰的口吻说：“黑老\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
