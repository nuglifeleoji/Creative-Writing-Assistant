halves. Either without the other was diminished, an emptiness with lost purpose. Not better dead, perhaps, but moving aimlessly. There lay the threat of Honored Matre victory. Aimed by blind violence!\nBlind in a hostile universe.\nAnd there was why the Tyrant had preserved the Sisterhood.\nHe knew he only gave us the path without direction. A paper chase laid down by a jokester and left empty at the end.\nA poet in his own right, though.\nShe recalled his “Memory Poem” from Dar-es-Balat, a bit of jetsam the Bene Gesserit preserved.\nAnd for what reason do we preserve it? So I can fill my mind with it now? Forgetting for the moment what I may confront tomorrow?\nThe fair night of the poet,\nFill it with innocent stars.\nA pace apart Orion stands. His glare sees everything, Marking our genes forever. Welcome darkness and stare, Blinded in the afterglow. There’s barren eternity!\nSheeana felt abruptly that she had won a chance to become the ultimate artist, filled to overflowing and presented with a blank surface where she might create as she wished.\nAn unrestricted universe!\nOdrade’s words from those first childhood exposures to Bene Gesserit purpose came back to her. “Why did we fasten onto you, Sheeana? It’s really simple. We recognized in you a thing we had long awaited. You arrived and we saw it happen.”\n“It?” How naive | was!\n“Something new lifting over the horizon.”\nMy migration will seek the new. But... | must find a planet with moons.\nLooked at one way, the universe is Brownian movement, nothing predictable at the elemental level. Muad’Dib and his Tyrant son closed the cloud chamber where movement occurred.\n—STORIES FROM GAMMU\nurbella entered a time of incongruent experiences. It\nbothered her at first, seeing her own life with multiple vision. Chaotic events at Junction had ignited this, creating a jumble of immediate necessities that would not leave her, not even when she returned to Chapterhouse.\nI warned you, Dar. You can’t deny it. | said they could turn victory into defeat. And look at the mess you dumped in my lap! | was lucky to save as many as |! did.\nThis inner protest always immersed her in the events that had elevated her to this awful prominence.\nWhat else could | have done?\nMemory displayed Streggi slumping to the floor in bloodless death. The scene had played on the no-ship’s relays like a fictional drama. The projection framework in the ship’s command bay added to the illusion that this was not really happening. The actors would arise and take their bows. Teg’s comeyes, humming away automatically, missed none of it until someone silenced them.\nShe was left with images, an eerie afterglow: Teg sprawled on the floor of that Honored Matre aerie. Odrade staring in shock.\nLoud protests greeted Murbella’s declaration that she must rush groundside. The Proctors were adamant until she laid out the details of Odrade’s gamble and demanded: “Do you want total disaster?”\nOdrade Within won that argument. But you were prepared for it from the first, weren’t you, Dar? Your plan!\nThe Proctors said: “There’s still Sheeana.” They gave Murbella a one-man lighter and sent her to Junction alone.\nEven though she transmitted her Honored Matre identity ahead of her, there were touchy moments at the Landing Flat.\nA squad of armed Honored Matres confronted her as she emerged from the lighter beside a smoking pit. The smoke smelled of exotic explosives.\nWhere Mother Superior’s lighter was destroyed.\nAn ancient Honored Matre led the squad, her red robe stained, some of its decorations gone and a rip down the left shoulder. She was like some dried-up lizard, still poisonous, still with a bite but running on well-used angers, most of her energy gone. Disarrayed hair like the outer skin of a fresh- dug ginger root. There was a demon in her. Murbella saw it peering from orange-flecked eyes.\nFor all the fact that a full squad backed up the old one, the two of them faced each other as though isolated at the foot of the lighter’s drop, wild animals cautiously sniffing, trying to judge the extent of danger.\nMurbella watched the old one carefully. This lizard would dart her tongue a bit, testing the air, giving vent to her emotions, but she was sufficiently shocked to listen.\n“Murbella is my name. | was taken captive by the Bene Gesserit on Gammu. | am an adept of the Hormu.”\n“Why are you wearing a witch’s robes?” The old one and her squad stood ready to kill.\n“I have learned everything they had to teach and have brought that treasure to my Sisters.”\nThe old one studied her a moment. “Yes, | recognize your type. You're a Roc, one we chose for the Gammu project.”\nThe squad behind her relaxed slightly.\n“You did not come all the way in that lighter,” the old one accused.\n“| escaped from one of their no-ships.”\n“Do you know where their nest is?”\n“I do.”\nA wide smile spread on the old one’s lips. “Well! You area prize! How did you escape?”\n“Do you have to ask?”\nThe old one considered this. Murbella could read the thoughts on her face as though they were spoken: These ones we brought from Roc—deadlly, all of them. They can kill with hands, feet, or any other movable part of their bodies. They all should carry a sign: “Dangerous in any position.”\nMurbella moved away from the lighter, displaying the sinewy grace that was a mark of her identity.\nSpeed and muscle, Sisters. Beware.\nSome of the squad pressed forward, curious. Their words were full of Honored Matre comparisons, eager questions Murbella was forced to parry.\n“Did you kill many of them? Where is their planet? Is it rich? Have you bonded many males there? You were trained on Gammu?”\n“I was on Gammu for the third stage. Under Hakka.”\n“Hakka! I’ve met her. Did she have that injured left foot when you knew her?”\nStill testing.\n“It was the right foot and | was with her when she took the injury!”\n“Oh, yes, the right foot. | remember now. How was she injured?”\n“Kicking a lout in the rear. He had a sharp knife in his hip pocket. Hakka was so angry she killed him.”\nLaughter swept through the squad.\n“We will go to Great Honored Matre,” the old one said.\nSo I’ve passed first inspection.\nMurbella sensed reservations, though.\nWhy is this Hormu adept wearing those enemy robes? And she has a strange look to her.\nBest face that one at once.\n“I took their training and they accepted me.”\n“The fools! Did they really?”\n“You question my word?” How easy it was to revert, adopting touchy Honored Matre ways.\nThe old one bristled. She did not lose hauteur but she sent a warning look to her squad. All of them took a moment to digest what Murbella had said.\n“You became one of them?” someone behind her asked.\n“How else could | steal their knowledge? Know this! | was the personal student of their Mother Superior.”\n“Did she teach you well?” That same challenging voice from behind.\nMurbella identified the questioner: middle echelon and ambitious. Anxious for notice and advancement.\nThis is the end of you, anxious one. And little loss to the universe.\nA Bene Gesserit feint drifted the feather that was her foe into range. One Hormu-style kick for them to recognize. The questioner lay dead on the ground.\nMarriage of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre abilities creates a danger you should all recognize and envy.\n“She taught me admirably,” Murbella said. “Any other questions?”\n“Ehhhhh!” the old one said.\n“How are you called?” Murbella demanded.\n“lam a Senior Dame, Honored Matre of the Hormu. | am called Elpek.”\n“Thank you, Elpek. You may call me Murbella.”\n“lam honored, Murbella. It is indeed a treasure you have brought us.”\nMurbella studied her a moment with Bene Gesserit watchfulness before smiling without humor.\nThe exchange of names! You in your red robe that marks you as one of the powerful surrounding Great Honored\nMatre, do you know what you have just accepted into your circle?\nThe squad remained shocked and looked at Murbella with wariness. She saw this with her new sensitivity. The Old Girl network had never gained a foothold in the Bene Gesserit but it performed for Honored Matres. Simulflow amused her with a parade of confirmation. How subtle the power transfers: right school, right friends, graduation and transfer onto the first rungs of the ladder—all guided by relatives and their connections, mutual back-scratching that managed alliances, including marriages. Simulflow told her it led into the pit but ones on the ladder, the ones in controlling niches, never let that worry them.\nToday is sufficient unto today, and that is how Elpek sees me. But she does not see what I have become, only that I am dangerous but potentially useful.\nTurning slowly on one foot, Murbella studied Elpek’s squad. No bonded males here. This was too sensitive a duty for any but trusted women. Good.\n“Now, you will listen to me, all of you. If you have any loyalty to our Sisterhood, which | will judge on future performance, you will honor what | have brought. | intend it as a gift for those who deserve it.”\n“Great Honored Matre will be pleased,” Elpek said.\nBut Great Honored Matre did not appear pleased when Murbella was presented.\nMurbella recognized the tower setting. Almost sunset now but Streggi’s body still lay where it had fallen. Some of Teg’s specialists had been killed, mostly the comeye crew who doubled as his guard.\nNo, we Honored Matres do not like others spying on us.\nTeg still lived, she saw, but he was swathed in shigawire and shoved disdainfully into a corner. Most surprising of all: Odrade stood unfettered near Great Honored Matre. It was a gesture of contempt.\nMurbella felt she had lived through such a scene many times—aftermath of Honored Matre Victory: swaths of their enemies’ bodies left where they had been brought down. Honored Matre attack with the bloodless weapon had been swift and deadly, a typical viciousness that killed when killing no longer was required. She suppressed a shudder at the memory of this deadly reversal. There had been no warning, only the troops dropping in wide lines—a domino effect that left the survivors in shock. And Great Honored Matre obviously enjoyed the shock.\nLooking at Murbella, Great Honored Matre said, “So this is the bag of insolence you say you trained in your ways.”\nOdrade almost smiled at the description.\nBag of insolence?\nA Bene Gesserit would accept it without rancor. This rheumy-eyed Great Honored Matre faced a quandary and could not call on her weapon that killed without blood. Very delicate balance of power. Agitated conversations among Honored Matres had revealed their problem.\nAll of their secret weapons had been exhausted and could not be reloaded, something they had lost when driven back here.\n“Our weapon of last resort and we wasted it!”\nLogno, who thought herself supreme, stood in a different arena now. And she had just learned of the", " memory of this deadly reversal. There had been no warning, only the troops dropping in wide lines—a domino effect that left the survivors in shock. And Great Honored Matre obviously enjoyed the shock.\nLooking at Murbella, Great Honored Matre said, “So this is the bag of insolence you say you trained in your ways.”\nOdrade almost smiled at the description.\nBag of insolence?\nA Bene Gesserit would accept it without rancor. This rheumy-eyed Great Honored Matre faced a quandary and could not call on her weapon that killed without blood. Very delicate balance of power.

And she had just learned of the fearful ease with which Murbella could kill one of the elect.\nMurbella cast a measuring gaze over Great Honored Matre’s entourage, gauging their potentials. They recognized this situation, of course. Familiar. How did they vote?\nNeutral?\nSome were wary and all were waiting.\nAnticipating a diversion. No concern over who triumphed as long as power continued to flow in their direction.\nMurbella let her muscles flow into the waiting stance of combat she had learned from Duncan and the Proctors. She\nfelt as cool as though standing on the practice floor, running through responses. Even as she reacted, she knew she moved in ways for which Odrade had prepared her— mentally, physically, and emotionally.\nVoice first. Give them a taste of inner chill.\n“I see you have assessed the Bene Gesserit quite poorly. The arguments of which you are so proud, these women have heard them so many times your words go beyond boredom.”\nThis was delivered with scathing vocal control, a tone that brought orange to Logno’s eyes but held her motionless.\nMurbella was not through with her. “You consider yourself powerful and clever. One begets the other, eh? What idiocy! You're a consummate liar and you lie to yourself.”\nAs Logno remained motionless in the face of this attack, those around her began moving away, opening space that said, “She is all yours.”\n“Your fluency in these lies does not hide them,” Murbella said. She swept a scornful gaze across the ones behind Logno. “Like the ones I know in Other Memory, you are headed for extinction. The problem is that you take so infernally long dying. Inevitable but oh, the boredom meanwhile. You dare call yourself Great Honored Matre!” Returning her attention to Logno. “Everything about you is a cesspool. You have no style.”\nIt was too much. Logno attacked, left foot slashing outward with blinding speed. Murbella grasped the foot as she would catch a wind-blown leaf and, continuing the flow of it, levered Logno into a threshing club that ended with her head pulped on the floor. Without pausing, Murbella pirouetted, left foot almost decapitating the Honored Matre who had stood at Logno’s right, the right hand crushing the throat of the one who had stood at Logno’s left. It was over in two heartbeats.\nExamining the scene without breathing hard (to show how easy it was, Sisters), Murbella experienced a sense of shock\nand recognition of the inevitable. Odrade lay on the floor in front of Elpek, who obviously had chosen sides without hesitation. The twisted position of Odrade’s neck and flaccid appearance of her body said she was dead.\n“She tried to interfere,” Elpek said.\nHaving killed a Reverend Mother, Elpek expected Murbella (a Sister, after all!) to applaud. But Murbella did not react as expected. She knelt beside Odrade and put her head against that of the corpse, staying there an interminable time.\nThe surviving Honored Matres exchanged questioning looks but dared not move.\nWhat is this?\nBut they were immobilized by Murbella’s terrifying abilities.\nWhen she had Odrade’s recent past, all of the new added to previous Sharing, Murbella stood.\nElpek saw death in Murbella’s eyes and took one backward step before trying to defend herself. Elpek was dangerous but no match for this demon in the black robe. It was over with the same shocking abruptness that had taken Logno and her aides: a kick to the larynx. Elpek sprawled across Odrade.\nOnce more, Murbella studied the survivors, then stood a moment looking down at Odrade’s body.\nIn a way, that was my doing, Dar. And yours!\nShe shook her head from side to side, absorbing consequences.\nOdrade is dead. Long live Mother Superior! Long live Great Honored Matre! And may the heavens protect us all.\nShe gave her attention then to what must be done. These deaths had created an enormous debt. Murbella took a deep breath. This was another Gordian knot.\n“Release Teg,” she said. “Clean up in here as quickly as possible. And somebody get me a proper robe!”\nIt was Great Honored Matre giving orders but those who leaped to obey sensed the Other in her.\nThe one who brought her a red robe elaborate with soostone dragons held it deferentially from a distance. Large woman with heavy bones and square face. Cruel eyes.\n“Hold it for me,” Murbella said and when the woman tried to take advantage of proximity to attack her, Murbella dumped the woman hard. “Try again?”\nThis time there were no tricks.\n“You are the first member of my Council,” Murbella said. “Name?”\n“Angelika, Great Honored Matre.” See! / was first to call you by your proper title. Reward me.\n“Your reward is that | promote you and let you live.”\nProper Honored Matre response. Accepted as such.\nWhen Teg came to her rubbing his arms where the shigawire had bitten deep, some Honored Matres tried to caution Murbella. “Do you know what this one can—”\n“He serves me now,” Murbella interrupted. Then in Odrade’s mocking tones: “Isn’t that right, Miles?”\nHe gave her a rueful smile, an old man on a child’s face. “Interesting times, Murbella.”\n“Dar liked apples,” Murbella said. “See to that.”\nHe nodded. Return her to a cemetery orchard. Not that prized Bene Gesserit orchards would endure long ina desert. Still, some traditions were worth perpetuating while you could.\nWhat do Holy Accidents teach? Be resilient. Be strong. Be ready for change, for the new. Gather many experiences and judge them by the steadfast nature of our faith.\n—TLEILAXU DOCTRINE\nWe\"! within Teg’s original timetable, Murbella picked her Honored Matre entourage and returned to Chapterhouse. She expected certain problems and the messages she sent ahead paved the way for solutions.\n“I bring Futars to attract Handlers. Honored Matres fear a biological weapon from the Scattering that made vegetables of them. Handlers may be the source.”\n“Prepare to keep Rabbi and party in no-ship. Honor their secrecy. And remove the protective mines from the ship!” (That went in keeping of a Proctor messenger.)\nShe was tempted to ask for her children but that was non-Bene Gesserit. Someday . .. maybe.\nImmediately on returning, she had Duncan to accommodate and this confused Honored Matres. They were as bad as the Bene Gesserit. “What’s so special about one man?”\nNo longer a reason for him to remain in the ship but he refused to leave. “I’ve a mental mosaic to assemble: a piece that cannot be moved, extraordinary behavior, and willing participation in their dream. | must find limits to test. That’s missing. | know how to find it. Get in tune. Don’t think; do it.”\nIt made no sense. She humored him although he was changed. A stability to this new Duncan that she accepted as a challenge. By what right did he assume a self-satisfied\nair? No... not self-satisfied. It was more being at peace with a decision. He refused to share it!\n“I’ve accepted things. You must do the same.”\nShe had to admit this described what she was doing.\nOn her first morning back, she arose at dawn and entered the workroom. Wearing the red robe, she sat in Mother Superior’s chair and summonded Bellonda.\nBell stood at one end of the worktable. She knew. The design became clear in execution. Odrade had imposed a debt on her as well. Thus, the silence: assessing how she must pay.\nService to this Mother Superior, Bell! That is how you pay. No Archival declension of these events will put them into proper perspective. Action Is required.\nBellonda spoke finally. “The only crisis I’d care to compare with this one is the advent of the Tyrant.”\nMurbella reacted sharply. “Hold your tongue, Bell, unless you've something useful to say!”\nBellonda took the reprimand calmly (uncharacteristic response). “Dar had changes in mind. This what she expected?”\nMurbella softened her tone. “We'll rehash ancient history later. This is an opening chapter.”\n“Bad news.” That was the old Bellonda.\nMurbella said: “Admit the first group. Be cautious. They are Great Honored Matre’s High Council.”\nBell left to obey.\nShe knows I have every right to this position. They all know it. No need for a vote. No room for a vote!\nNow was the time for the historical art of politics she had learned from Odrade.\n“In all things you must appear important. No minor decisions pass through your hands unless they are quiet acts called ‘favors’ done for people whose loyalty can be earned.”\nEvery reward came from on high. Not a good policy with the Bene Gesserit but this group entering the workroom, they were familiar with a Patroness Great Honored Matre; they would accept “new political necessities.” Temporarily. It was always temporary, especially with Honored Matres.\nBell and watchdogs knew she would be a long time sorting this out. Even with amplified Bene Gesserit abilities.\nIt would require extremely demanding attention from all of them. And the first thing was the sharply discerning gaze of innocence.\nThat is what Honored Matres lost, and we must restore it before they can fade into the background where “we” belong.\nBellonda ushered in the Council and retired silently.\nMurbella waited until they were seated. A mixed lot: some aspirants to supreme power. Angelika there smiling so prettily. Some waiting (not even daring to hope yet) but gathering what they could.\n“Our Sisterhood was acting with stupidity,” Murbella accused. She noted the ones who took this angrily. “You would have killed the goose!”\nThey did not understand. She dredged up the parable. They listened with proper attention, even when she added: “Don’t you realize how desperately we need every one of these witches? We outnumber them so greatly that each of them will carry an enormous teaching burden!”\nThey considered this and, bitter though it was, they were forced to a qualified acceptance because she said it.\nMurbella hammered it home. “Not only am I your Great Honored Matre ... Does anyone question that?”\nNo one questioned.\n“but | am Bene Gesserit Mother Superior. They can do little else but confirm me in office.”\nTwo of them", ".

They can do little else but confirm me in office.”\nTwo of them started to protest but Murbella cut them Short. “No! You would be powerless to enforce your will on\nthem. You would have to kill them all. But they will obey me.”\nThe two continued to babble and she shouted them down: “Compared to me with what | acquired from them, the lot of you are miserable weaklings! Do any of you challenge that?”\nNo one challenged but orange flecks were there.\n“You are children with no knowledge of what you might become,” she said. “Would you return defenseless to face the ones of many faces? Would you become vegetables?”\nThat caught their interest. They were accustomed to this tone from older commanders. The content held them now. It was difficult to accept from one so young... still... the things she had done. And to Logno and her aides!\nMurbella saw them admire the bait.\nFertilization. This group will carry it away with them. Hybrid vigor. We are fertilized to grow stronger. And flower. And go to seed? Best not dwell on that. Honored Matres will not see it until they are almost Reverend Mothers. Then they will look back angrily as I did. How could we have been that stupid?\nShe saw submission take shape in councillors’ eyes. There would be a honeymoon. Honored Matres would be children in a candy store. Only gradually would the inevitable grow plain to them. Then they would be trapped.\nAs | was trapped. Don’t ask the oracle what you can gain. That’s the trap. Beware the real fortune teller! Would you like thirty-five hundred years of boredom?\nOdrade Within objected.\nGive the Tyrant some credit. It couldn’t all have been boredom. More like a Guild Navigator picking his passage through foldspace. Golden Path. An Atreides paid for your survival, Murbella.\nMurbella felt burdened. The Tyrant’s payment dumped on her shoulders. / didn’t ask him to do it for me.\nOdrade could not let that pass. He did it nonetheless.\nSorry, Dar. He paid. Now, | must pay.\nSo you are a Reverend Mother at last!\nThe councillors had grown restive under her stare.\nAngelika elected to speak for them. After all, | am first chosen.\nWatch that one! A blaze of ambition in her eyes.\n“What response are you asking us to take with these witches?” Alarmed by her own boldness. Was not Great Honored Matre also a witch now?\nMurbella spoke softly. “You will tolerate them and offer them no violence whatsoever.”\nAngelika was emboldened by Murbella’s mild tone. “Is that Great Honored Matre’s decision or the—”\n“Enough! | could bloody the floor of this room with the lot of you! Do you wish to test it?”\nThey did not wish to test it.\n“And what if | say to you that it is Mother Superior speaking? You will ask do | have a policy to meet our problem? | will say: Policy? Ahh, yes. | have a policy for unimportant things such as insect infestations. Unimportant things call for policies. For such of you as do not see the wisdom in my decision, | need no policy. Your kind | dispose of quickly. Dead before you know you've been injured! That is my response to the presence of filth. Is there any filth in this room?”\nIt was language they recognized: the lash of the Great Honored Matre backed by ability to kill.\n“You are my Council,” Murbella said. “I expect wisdom from you. The least you can do is pretend you are wise.”\nHumorous sympathy from Odrade: /f that’s the way Honored Matres give and take orders, it won’t require much deep analysis by Bell.\nMurbella’s thoughts went elsewhere. / am no longer Honored Matre.\nThe step from one to another was so recent she found her Honored Matre performance uncomfortable. Her\nadjustments were a metaphor of what would happen to her former Sisters. A new role and she did not wear it well. Other Memory simulated long association with herself as this new person. This was no mystical transubstantiation, merely new abilities.\nMerely?\nThe change was profound. Did Duncan realize this? It pained her that he might never see through to this new person.\nIs that the residue of my love for him?\nMurbella drew back from her questions, not wanting an answer. She felt repelled by something that went deeper than she cared to burrow.\nThere will be decisions | must make that love would prevent. Decisions for the Sisterhood and not for myself. That is where my fear is pointing.\nImmediate necessities restored her. She sent her councillors away, promising pain and death if they failed to learn this new restraint.\nNext, Reverend Mothers must be taught a new diplomacy: getting along with no one—not even with each other. It would grow easier in time. Honored Matres slipping into Bene Gesserit ways. One day, there would be no Honored Matres; only Reverend Mothers with improved reflexes and augmented knowledge of sexuality.\nMurbella felt haunted by words she had heard but not accepted until this moment. “The things we will do for Bene Gesserit survival have no limits.”\nDuncan will see this. | cannot keep it from him. The Mentat will not hold to a fixed idea of what | was before the Agony. He opens his mind as I open a door. He will examine his net. “What have I caught this time?”\nWas this what happened to Lady Jessica? Other Memory carried Jessica threaded into the warp and woof of Sharings. Murbella unraveled a bit and paraded elder knowledge.\nHeretic Lady Jessica? Malfeasance in office?\nJessica had plunged into love as Odrade had plunged into the sea and the resultant waves had all but engulfed the Sisterhood.\nMurbella sensed this taking her where she did not want to go. Pain clutched her chest.\nDuncan! Ohhhh, Duncan! She dropped her face into her hands. Dar, helo me. What am I to do?\nNever ask why you're a Reverend Mother.\nI must! The progression is clear in my memory and...\nThat’s a sequence. Thinking of it as cause and effect beguiles you away from totality.\nTao?\nSimpler: You are here.\nBut Other Memory goes back and back and...\nImagine it’s pyramids—interlocked.\nThose are just words!\nIs your body still functioning?\n/ hurt, Dar. You don’t have a body anymore and it’s useless to...\nWe occupy different niches. The pains | felt are not your pains. My joys are not yours.\n| don’t want your sympathy! Ohh, Dar! Why was I born?\nWere you born to lose Duncan?\nDar, please!\nSo you were born and now you know that’s never enough. So you became an Honored Matre. What else could you do? Still not enough? Now you're a Reverend Mother. You think that’s enough? It’s never enough as long as you're alive.\nYou're telling me I must always reach beyond myself.\nPah! You don’t make decisions on that basis. Didn’t you hear him? Don’t think; do it! Will you choose the easy way? Why should you feel sad because you’ve encountered the inevitable? If that’s all you can see, confine yourself to improving the breed!\nDamn you! Why did you do this to me?\nDo what?\nMake me see myself and my former Sisters this way!\nWhat way?\nDamn you! You know what I mean!\nFormer Sisters, you say?\nOh, you are insidious.\nAll Reverend Mothers are insidious.\nYou never stop teaching!\nIs that what I do?\nHow innocent | was! Asking you what you really do.\nYou know as well as I do. We wait for humankind to mature. The Tyrant only provided them time to grow but now they need care.\nWhat’s the Tyrant have to do with my pain?\nYou foolish woman! Did you fail the Agony?\nYou know I didn’t!\nStop stumbling over the obvious.\nOh, you bitch!\n| prefer witch. Either is preferable to whore.\nThe only difference between Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre is the marketplace. You married our Sisterhood.\nOur Sisterhood?\nYou bred for power! How is that different from...\nDon't twist it, Murbella! Keep your eyes on survival.\nDon't tell me you had no power.\nTemporary authority over people intent on survival.\nSurvival again!\nIn a Sisterhood that promotes the survival of others. Like the married woman who bears children.\nSo it comes down to procreation.\nThat’s a decision you make for yourself: family and what binds it. What tickles life and happiness?\nMurbella began to laugh. She dropped her hands and opened her eyes to find Bellonda standing there watching.\n“That’s always a temptation for a new Reverend Mother, Bellonda said. “Chat a bit with Other Memory. Who was it this time? Dar?”\n”\nMurbella nodded.\n“Don’t trust anything they give you. It’s lore and you judge it for yourself.”\nOdrade’s words exactly. Look through the eyes of the dead at scenes long gone. What a peep show!\n“You can get lost in there for hours,” Bellonda said. “Exercise restraint. Be sure of your ground. One hand for yourself and one for the ship.”\nThere it was again! The past applied to the present. How rich Other Memory made everyday life.\n“It'll pass,” Bellonda said. “It gets to be old hat after a time.” She laid a report in front of Murbella.\nOld hat! One hand for yourself and one for the ship. So much just in idioms.\nMurbella leaned back in the slingchair to scan Bellonda’s report, fancying herself suddenly in Odrade’s idiom: Spider Queen in the center of my web. The web might be a bit frayed just now but it was still there catching things to be digested. Twitch a trigger strand and Bell came running, mandibles flexing in anticipation. The twitch-words were “Archives” and “Analysis.”\nSeeing Bellonda in this light, Murbella saw the wisdom in the ways Odrade had employed her, flaws as valuable as the strengths. When Murbella finished the report, Bellonda still stood there in characteristic attitude.\nMurbella recognized that Bellonda looked on all who Summoned her as ones who had not measured up, people who called on Archives for frivolous reasons and had to be set straight. Frivolity: Bellonda’s béte noire. Murbella found this amusing.\nMurbella kept amusement masked while enjoying Bellonda. The way to deal with her was to be scrupulous. Nothing to subtract from strengths. This report was a model of concise and pertinent argument.
