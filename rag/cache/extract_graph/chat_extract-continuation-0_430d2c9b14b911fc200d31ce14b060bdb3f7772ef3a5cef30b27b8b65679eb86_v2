He knows this ts the kind of infraction | was instructed to ignore.\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy- faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.\nNow, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents. That Is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to separate this element for your analysis—in the beginning, through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by close observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You will find it\nfairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.\nNow, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern—subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.\nDoes this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself. /t’s his pattern.\nThe banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.\n“I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,” the banker said, directing his words at Jessica. “All of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers.”\nThe stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, seated between Paul and his father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: “Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.”\nThe banker smiled. “They call me Soo-Soo because I’m financial adviser to the Water Peddlers Union.” And, as Jessica continued to look at him without comment, he added: “Because of the water- sellers’ cry—‘Soo-Soo Sook!’” And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.\nJessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cue—a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had said: “/, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis—water.”\nPaul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion’s voice, saw that his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the banker.\n“Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?”\n“That’s an odd question, young Master,” the banker said. “I merely said the birds drink blood. It doesn’t have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?”\n“It was not an odd question,” Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. “Most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind.” He deliberately forked a bite of food from his\ncompanion’s plate, ate it. “They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.”\nThe banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.\n“Do not make the error of considering my son a child,” the Duke said. And he smiled.\nJessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.\n“It’s a rule of ecology,” Kynes said, “that the young Master appears to understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood’s an efficient energy source.”\nThe banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: “It’s said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.”\nKynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: “Not the blood, sir. But all of a man’s water, ultimately, belongs to his people—to his tribe. It’s a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water’s precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.”\nThe banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.\nKynes looked at Jessica. “Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying.”\n“You’ve associated so long with Fremen that you've lost all sensibilities,” the banker rasped.\nKynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. “Are you challenging me, sir?”\nThe banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: “Of course not. I’d not so insult our host and hostess.”\nJessica heard the fear in the man’s voice, saw it in his face, in his breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!\n“Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when they’ve been insulted, Kynes said. “They’re brave people who understand defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here...now...on Arrakis.”\nJessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker’s discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.\n“Well?” Kynes said.\n“I meant no offense,” the banker muttered. “If offense was taken, please accept my apologies.”\n“Freely given, freely accepted,” Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.\nJessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes’ assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.\nLeto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The ecologist’s manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.\nJessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared with /angues de lapins de garenne—red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side.\nSlowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would have killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes’ manner. He was a casual killer, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.\nJessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: “I find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.”\n“Very important,” he agreed. “What is this dish? It’s delicious.”\n“Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,” she said. “A very old recipe.”\n“I must have that recipe,” the man said.\nShe nodded. “I'll see that you get it.”\nKynes looked at Jessica, said: “The newcomer to Arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum.”\nShe heard the testing quality in his voice, said, “Growth is limited by that necessity which is present\nin the least amount. And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.”\n“It’s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems,” Kynes said. “Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care.”\nJessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes’ words, but knew she was missing it. “Growth,” she said. “Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?”\n“Impossible!” the water magnate barked.\nJessica turned her attention to Bewt. “Impossible?”\n“Impossible on Arrakis,” he said. “Don’t listen to this dreamer. All the laboratory evidence is against him.”\nKynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.\n“Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,” Kynes said. “That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.”\n“Normal!” Bewt snorted. “Nothing about Arrakis is normal!”\n“Quite the contrary,” Kynes said. “Certain harmonies could be set up here along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it.”\n“It'll never be done,” Bewt said.\nThe Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes’ attitude had changed—it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.\n“What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?” Leto asked.\n“If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we’ve started the cyclic system,” Kynes said.\n“Water’s the only problem?” the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes’ excitement, felt himself caught up in it.\n“Water overshadows the other problems,” Kynes said. “This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants—widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.”\n“Do you have pilot projects?” the Duke asked. “We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect—small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its\nworking facts,” Kynes said.\n“There isn’t enough water,” Bewt said. “There just isn’t enough water.”\n“Master Bewt is an expert on water,” Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! | want an answer!
