He was the husband of **桐原弥生子** and the father of **桐原亮司**, whom he reportedly doted on. As the proprietor of **Kirihara Pawnshop (桐原当铺)**, he was found stabbed to death in an abandoned, unfinished building in the autumn of 1973. The case remains unresolved, with key evidence including a missing **Dunhill (登喜路) lighter** and the theft of **one million yen in cash** that he had withdrawn from his bank account shortly before his death.  \n\nPrior to his murder, **桐原洋介** had financial dealings with **西本文代**, and there are allegations that he may have had inappropriate intentions toward her. Additionally, he was implicated in disturbing behavior, including **pedophilic tendencies** and an attempt to **adopt 雪穗 (Yukiho)** through a monetary transaction, which contributed to significant emotional trauma for his son, **亮司**.  \n\nThe circumstances of his death suggest premeditation, as he was discovered with **multiple stab wounds**, and the large sum of money he carried was stolen. His funeral was held shortly after the discovery of his body.
