了个有期徒刑，在这里屈指计算着刑满释放的那一天到来。日子过得多么平静，什么事情都没有。可他的心如火焚，如油煎，真的就象一个囚犯坐牢一般难熬，白天，他拿着一张月票，从一辆公共汽车上跳下来，又上了另一辆公共汽车。首都所有的名胜古迹都去了两次以上。 \n　　那一晚上，他躺在旅馆的床上，象通常一样，翻过身调过身睡不着。他又回到了自己的家……现在，他似乎看见润叶已经拆掉了墙角的那张小床，把自己的被褥抱到了双人床上，和他的被褥摞在一起。两只枕头也亲密地紧挨在一起了。润叶腰里束起了一件叫人心疼的小小的印花布围裙，正在拿一把笤帚把双人床单扫得干干净净。炉子的火正旺，房间里暖烘烘的；炉上的铁壶冒着水蒸汽，发出轻微的咝咝声。她现在坐在炉边的小凳上，正给他洗衣服，两只小巧的手在肥皂水里浸得通红。她突然停止了揉搓衣服，坐在小凳上发起了呆。她一定是想起了他。是的！你看她都不洗衣服了，站起来冲掉了手上的肥皂沫，慢慢地踱到那个小窗前面来，对，小窗正是朝北开的。啊啊！她是在向遥远的北方眺望呢！看她的嘴唇在微微地翕动——那一定是在喃喃地念叨着他的名字，呼唤他赶快回到她身边来…… \n　　李向前热泪盈眶地沉浸在自己的幻觉中。不，他不认为这是幻觉。这一切都是真的！ \n　　他于是在第二天怀着无比激动的心情，在西单，在东单，在前门大街，在王府井，跑来跑去买了一整天东西。他主要是给润叶买衣服。他把身上带的钱，除留够路费以外，全部都买了东西，装满了一个大箱和一个小箱。大箱里全是给润叶买的衣服和日用品，小箱里是给他家和润叶家的老人买的礼物。 \n　　他提着这两箱东西，就象多年在外的游子要回到亲人的身边，坐完火车，又坐汽车，恨不能长上翅膀，飞回到原西县城。跟泪在眼眶里旋转着，幸福的情感如同电流一般不时在全身通过，使他忍不住想咧开嘴哭上几声。 \n　　他在省城下了火车后，就给润叶拍发了一封电报——我于×月×日坐汽车到请接前本来到原西车站后，离家也就不太远了，他自己可以提着箱子回家。但他觉得还是应该给润叶打个电报。否则，她说不定要埋怨他不让她到车站来接他。 \n　　当汽车快要到原西城的时候，李向前脸烫得炭火一般；并且能听见自己“咚咚”的心跳声。农场、机械厂、银行、副食公司、林业站、自行车\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LI XIANGQIAN<|>PERSON<|>Li
