本规定的“教学大纲”的范围内。而许多这样的考试已和旧朝代的“八股”无异。中国这种考试方式鼓励了死记硬背，但往往排斥了真正的才学。 \n　　孙少平的遗撼倒不在文科方面，主要是数、理、化。他误得太多，前后接不上碴，虽然这学期听课，也听不懂。听不懂就听不懂，反正也不上多少课——现在学校上课已是一件附带的事。 \n　　现在，他没有事的时候，就仍然看课外书。晓霞还象以前一样，从她家里拿许多书来让他看。他们每天也在学校操场的报栏前不期而遇。星期六的时候，晓霞还把她爸订的《参考消息》给他拿来，他星期天就哪里也不去，兴致勃勃地看这些外国通讯社的电讯稿，脑子里在许多国家游荡老半天。 \n　　这一天下午，田晓霞突然匆匆忙忙到宿舍来找他，让他跟她到外面走一趟。 \n　　少平有点莫名其妙。晓霞有什么话不能在这里说，非要到外面去不可呢？ \n　　因为宿舍有同学，他不好说什么，就只好跟出来了。出了门以后，少平赶紧问她：“什么事？是不是我家里又出事了？”他生怕自己家里又有什么灾难——他那个家常常猛不防就出意外！ \n　　晓霞一边走，一边对他说：“不是你家里的事。”“那是你们家出了什么事？”少平又撵着问她。 \n　　晓霞说：“不是你家，也不是我家，是国家……” \n　　国家？国家又出什么事了？今年国家真是灾难重重！元月周总理逝世，四月五日发生了“天安门事件”，撤销了邓小平的职务。紧接着，七月六日朱德委员长逝世，前几天又发生了震动全球的唐山大地震……多灾多难的中国啊，你叫人多么忧心和焦虑！ \n　　他匆匆跟着晓霞走，先不便再问她什么了。看来晓霞一句两句说不清楚，而显然在稠人广众面前也不好说。 \n　　他和晓霞出了学校总务处后面的那个小门，一直沿校墙根向一个小山沟里走去。 \n　　直到看不见人的地方，晓霞才停下来，从衣袋里掏出一个笔记本，递到他手里。 \n　　他不知是何事，慌忙紧张地打开那个神秘的绿皮笔记本——扉页上一行醒目的钢笔字立即跳入眼帘：《天安门广场诗抄》！ \n　　啊啊！原来是这！ \n　　孙少平先没顾上和晓霞说什么，激动地开始看这些诗。他看着看着，都忍不住读出声来了——欲悲闻鬼叫， \n　　我哭豺狼笑。 \n　　洒泪祭雄杰， \n　　扬眉剑出鞘！ \n　　孙少平用飞快的速度把这个笔记本上的诗先翻着看了一遍，然后问晓霞：“你从哪儿搞来的？” \n　　晓霞说：“我哥暑假里带回来的。先前\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
