夫人曰：“二叔向在许都，原出于无奈。”飞曰：“嫂嫂休要被他瞒过了！忠臣宁死而不辱。大丈夫岂有事二主之理！”关公曰：“贤弟休屈了我。”孙乾曰：“云长特来寻将军。”飞喝曰：“如何你也胡说！他那里有好心，必是来捉我！”关公曰：“我若捉你，须带军马来。”飞把手指曰：“兀的不是军马来也！”关公回顾，果见尘埃起处，一彪人马来到。风吹旗号，正是曹军。张飞大怒曰：“今还敢支吾么？”挺丈八蛇矛便搠将来。关公急止之曰：“贤弟且住。你看我斩此来将，以表我真心。”飞曰：“你果有真心，我这里三通鼓罢。便要你斩来将！”关公应诺。须臾，曹军至。为首一将，乃是蔡阳，挺刀纵马大喝曰：“你杀吾外甥秦琪，却原来逃在此！吾奉丞相命，特来拿你！”关公更不打话，举刀便砍。张飞亲自擂鼓。只见一通鼓未尽，关公刀起处，蔡阳头已落地。众军士俱走。关公活捉执认旗的小卒过来，问取来由。小卒告说：“蔡阳闻将军杀了他外甥，十分忿怒，要来河北与将军交战。丞相不肯，因差他往汝南攻刘辟。不想在这里遇着将军。”关公闻言，教去张飞前告说其事。飞将关公在许都时事细问小卒；小卒从头至尾，说了一遍，飞方才信。\n\n

正说间，忽城中军士来报：“城南门外有十数骑来的甚紧，不知是甚人。”张飞心中疑虑，便转出南门看时，果见十数骑轻弓短箭而来。见了张飞，滚鞍下马。视之，乃糜竺、糜芳也。飞亦下马相见。竺曰：“自徐州失散，我兄弟二人逃难回乡。使人远近打听，知云长降了曹操，主公在于河北；又闻简雍亦投河北去了。只不知将军在此。昨于路上遇见一伙客人，说有一姓张的将军，如此模样，今据古城。我兄弟度量必是将军，故来寻访。幸得相见！”飞曰：“云长兄与孙乾送二嫂方到，已知哥哥下落。”二糜大喜，同来见关公，并参见二夫人。飞遂迎请二嫂入城。至衙中坐定，二夫人诉说关公历过之事，张飞方才大哭，参拜云长。二糜亦俱伤感。张飞亦自诉别后之事，一面设宴贺喜。\n\n
