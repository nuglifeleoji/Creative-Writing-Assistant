 “很简单。如果A子是凶手，那这个说法就不成立，因为她没有车。而且她根本不会开车，这样就无法搬运尸体。”\n    “原来如此，这点倒是不容忽视。”\n    “还有留在现场的脚踏车，当然也可以推断那是凶手故布疑阵，好让人以为该处就是犯罪现场；可是那样的话，在车上留下指纹就毫无意义了。因为尸体的指纹已遭到烧毁。”\n    “那辆脚踏车的确是个迷――就各种角度而言。”汤川像弹钢琴似的在桌边舞动着五指，等动作停下后他说，“不管怎样，判定是男人犯罪应该比较妥当吧。”\n    “这正是专案小组的主流意见，不过这并不表示就和A子划清关系了。”\n    “你是说A子有男性共犯？”\n    “目前，我们正在清查她的周边关系。她以前做过酒女，不可能和男人毫无关系。”\n    “你这种话要是让全国的酒店小姐听到的话，他们恐怕会生气喔。”汤川嬉皮笑脸的喝着啤酒，然后一脸正经的说，“可以给我看看刚才那张画吗？”\n    “你说这个？”草S把死者服装的速写图递给他。\n    汤川边看边嘟囔。\n    “凶手为什么要剥下尸体的衣服？”\n    “那当然是为了隐瞒死者身份，就跟毁掉脸孔和指纹一样。”\n    “如果是那样，应该带走脱下的衣服就行了吧？就是因为他没事找事想烧掉，结果烧到一半就熄了，才让你们有机会做出这种肖像图。”\n    “大概是太慌张吧。”\n    “基本上，如果是皮夹或驾照之类的东西或许还有可能，从衣服和鞋子能查出身份吗？剥除尸体衣服所冒的风险太大了。站在凶手的立场来看，应该只想尽快逃走才对。”\n    “你到底想说什么？难道脱下衣服还能有什么其他理由？”\n    “我无法断言。不过如果真有其他理由，在没有弄清那个理由之前，你们恐怕绝对找不出凶手。”汤川说着，用手指在肖像图上画了一个大大的问号。\n\n    （书中空两行）\n    二年三班期末考的数学成绩惨不忍睹。不只是三班，整个二年级都考得很糟。石神觉得，这些学生一年比一年不会用脑了。\n
