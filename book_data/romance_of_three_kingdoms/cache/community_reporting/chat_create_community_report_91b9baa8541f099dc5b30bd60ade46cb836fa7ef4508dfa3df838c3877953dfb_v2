Recognizing the potential of 吕布 as a formidable warrior, 李肃 sought to persuade him to join forces with 董卓 by offering the legendary horse 赤兔马 (Red Hare), known for its exceptional speed and strength, which would enhance 吕布's military capabilities.\n\nHowever, as the political landscape shifted, 李肃 and 吕布 found themselves united by a common goal: the removal of the tyrant 董卓. 李肃 supported 吕布's plan to assassinate 董卓, indicating a significant shift in their alliance from one of cooperation to one of conspiracy against a common enemy. This collaboration highlights the complexities of loyalty and ambition during a tumultuous period in Chinese history.\n\nUltimately, 李肃 emerged as an ally of 吕布 in their efforts against 董卓, demonstrating a strategic partnership that was driven by their mutual interests in overthrowing a despotic ruler.
