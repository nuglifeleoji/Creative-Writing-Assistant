Have they taught you about democracy?”\n“Yes, sir. That’s where you vote for—”\n“That’s where you distrust anyone with power over you! The Sisters know it well. Don’t trust too much.”\n“Then | should not trust you, either?”\n“The only trust you can place in me is that | will do my best to restore your original memories.”\n“Then | don’t care how much it hurts.” He looked up at the comeyes, knowledge of their purpose in his expression. “Do they mind that you say these things about them?”\n“Their feelings don’t concern a Mentat except as data.”\n“Does that mean fact?”\n“Facts are fragile. A Mentat can get tangled in them. Too much reliable data. It’s like diplomacy. You need a few good lies to get at your projections.”\n“I’m... confused.” He used the word hesitantly, not sure it was what he meant.\n“I said that once to Mother Superior. She said: ‘I’ve been behaving badly.’”\n“You're not supposed to... confuse me?”\n“Unless it teaches.” And when Teg still looked puzzled, Idaho said: “Let me tell you a story.”\nTeg immediately sat on the floor, an action revealing that Odrade often used the same technique. Good. Teg already was receptive.\n“In one of my lives | had a dog that hated clams,” Idaho said.\n“I’ve had clams. They come from the Great Sea.”\n“Yes, well, my dog hated clams because one of them had the temerity to spit in his eye. That stings. But even worse, it was an innocent hole in the sand that did the spitting. No clam visible.”\n“What'd your dog do?” Leaning forward, chin on fist.\n“He dug up the offender and brought it to me.” Idaho grinned. “Lesson one: Don’t let the unknown spit in your eye.”\nTeg laughed and clapped his hands.\n“But look at it from the dog’s viewpoint. Go after the spitter! Then—glorious reward: Master is pleased.”\n“Did your dog dig more clams?”\n“Every time we went to the beach. He went growling after spitters and Master took them away never to be seen again except as empty shells with bits of meat still clinging to the insides.”\n“You ate them.”\n“See it as the dog did. Spitters get their just punishment. He has a way to rid his world of offensive things and Master is pleased with him.”\nTeg demonstrated his brightness. “Do the Sisters think of us as dogs?”\n“In a way. Never forget it. When you get back to your rooms, look up ‘lèse majesté.’ It helps place our relationship to our Masters.”\nTeg looked up at the comeyes and back to Idaho but said nothing.\nIdaho lifted his attention to the door behind Teg and said: “That story was for you, too.”\nTeg jumped to his feet, turning and expecting to see Mother Superior. But it was only Murbella.\nShe was leaning against the wall near the door.\n“Bell won’t like you talking about the Sisterhood that way,” she said.\n“Odrade told me | have a free hand.” He looked at Teg. “We've wasted enough time on stories! Let me see if your body has learned anything.”\nAn odd feeling of excitement had come over Murbella as she entered the training area and saw Duncan with the child. She watched for a time, aware that she was seeing him in a new and almost Bene Gesserit light. Mother\nSuperior’s briefing came out in Duncan’s candor with Teg. Extremely odd sensation, this new awareness, as though she had come a full step away from her former associates. The feeling was poignant with loss.\nMurbella found herself missing strange things in her former life. Not the hunting in the streets, seeking new males to captivate and bring under Honored Matre control. The powers that came from creating sexual addicts had lost their savor under Bene Gesserit teaching and her experiences with Duncan. She admitted to missing one element of that power, though: the sense of belonging to a force nothing could stop.\nIt was both abstract and specific. Not the recurrent conquests but the expectation of inevitable victory that came in part from the drug she shared with Honored Matre Sisters. As the need waned in the shift to melange, she saw the old addiction from a different perspective. Bene Gesserit chemists, tracing the adrenaline substitute from samples of her blood, held it ready if she required it. She knew she did not. Another withdrawal plagued her. Not the captivated males but the flow of them. Something within her said this was gone forever. She would never re-experience it. New knowledge had changed her past.\nShe had prowled the corridors between her quarters and the practice floor this morning, wanting to watch Duncan with the child, afraid her presence might interfere. This prowling was a thing she often did these days after the more strenuous of her morning lessons with a Reverend Mother teacher. Thoughts of Honored Matres were much with her at these times.\nShe could not escape this feeling of loss. It was an emptiness such that she wondered if anything could possibly fill it. The sensation was worse than that of growing old. Growing old as an Honored Matre had offered its compensations. Powers gathered in that Sisterhood had a\ntendency to grow rapidly with age. Not that. It was an absolute loss.\n| have been defeated.\nHonored Matres never contemplated defeat. Murbella felt herself forced to it. She knew Honored Matres were sometimes slain by enemies. Those enemies always paid. It was the law: whole planets blackened to get one offender.\nMurbella knew Honored Matres hunted for Chapterhouse. As a matter of former loyalties, she was aware she should be assisting those hunters. The poignancy of her personal defeat lay in the fact that she did not want the Bene Gesserit to pay the remembered price.\nThe Bene Gesserit are too valuable.\nThey were infinitely valuable to Honored Matres. Murbella doubted that any other Honored Matre even suspected this.\nVanity.\nThat was the judgment she attached to her former Sisters. And to myself as | was. A terrible pride. It had grown out of being subjugated so many generations before they gained their own ascendancy. Murbella had tried to convey this to Odrade, recounting from history taught by Honored Matres.\n“The slave makes an awful master,” Odrade said.\nThere was an Honored Matre pattern, Murbella realized. She had accepted it once but now rejected it and could not give all of her reasons for this change.\n| have grown out of those things. They would be childish to me now.\nDuncan once more had stopped the practice session. Perspiration poured from both teacher and student. They stood panting, regaining breath, an odd exchange of looks between them. Conspiracy? The child looked strangely mature.\nMurbella recalled Odrade’s comment: “Maturity imposes its own behavior. One of our lessons—make those imperatives available to consciousness. Modify instincts.”\nThey have modified me and will do so even more.\nShe could see the same thing at work in Duncan’s behavior with the ghola-child.\n“This is an activity that creates many stresses in the societies we influence,” Odrade had said. “That forces us to constant adjustments.”\nBut how can they adjust to my former Sisters?\nOdrade revealed characteristic sangfroid when braced with this question.\n“We face major adjustments because of our past activities. It was the same during the reign of the Tyrant.”\nAdjustments?\nDuncan was talking to the child. Murbella moved closer to listen.\n“You’ve been exposed to the story of Muad’Dib? Good. You're an Atreides and that includes flaws.”\n“Does that mean mistakes, sir?”\n“You're damned right it does! Never choose a course just because it offers the opportunity for a dramatic gesture.”\n“Is that how | died?”\nHe had the child thinking of his former self in the first person.\n“You be the judge. But it was always an Atreides weakness. Attractive things, gestures. Die on the horns of a great bull as Muad’Dib’s grandfather did. A grand spectacle for his people. The stuff of stories for generations! You can even hear bits of it around after all of these eons.”\n“Mother Superior told me that story.”\n“Your birth-mother probably told it to you, too.”\nThe child shuddered. “It gives me a funny feeling when you say birth-mother.” Awe in his young voice.\n“Funny feelings are one thing; this lesson is another. I’m talking about something with a persistent label: The Desian Gesture. It used to be Atre/idesian but that’s too cumbersome.”\nOnce more the child touched that core of mature awareness. “Even a dog’s life has its price.”\nMurbella caught her breath, glimpsing how it would be— an adult mind in that child’s body. Disconcerting.\n“Your birth-mother was Janet Roxbrough of the Lernaeus Roxbroughs,” Idaho said. “She was Bene Gesserit. Your father was Loschy Teg, a CHOAM station factor. In a few minutes I’m going to show you the Bashar’s favorite picture of his home on Lernaeus. | want you to keep it with you and study it. Think of it as your favorite place.”\nTeg nodded but the expression on his face said he was afraid.\nWas it possible the great Mentat Warrior had known fear? Murbella shook her head. She had an intellectual knowledge of what Duncan was doing but felt gaps in the accounts. This was something she might never experience. What would the feeling be—reawakening to new life with the memories of another lifetime intact? Much different from a Reverend Mother’s Other Memory, she suspected.\n“Mind at its beginning,” Duncan called it. “Awakening of your True Self. | felt | had been plunged into a magic universe. My awareness was a circle and then a globe. Arbitrary forms became transient. The table was not a table. Then | fell into a trance—everything around me had a shimmering quality. Nothing was real. This passed and | felt | had lost the one reality. My table was a table once more.”\nShe had studied the Bene Gesserit manual “On Awakening a Ghola’s Original Memories.” Duncan was diverging from those instructions. Why?\nHe left the child and approached Murbella.\n“I have to talk to Sheeana,” he said as he passed her. “There’s got to be a better way.”\nReady comprehension is often a knee-jerk response and the most dangerous form of understanding. It blinks an opaque screen over your ability to learn. The judgmental precedents of law function that way, littering your path with dead ends. Be warned. Understand nothing. All comprehension is temporary.\n—MENTAT FIXE (ADACTO)\ndaho, seated alone at his console, encountered an entry\nhe had stored in Shipsystems during his first days of confinement, and found himself dumped (he applied the word later) into attitudes and sensory awareness of that earlier time. It no longer was afternoon of a frustrating day in the no-ship. He was back there, stretched between then and now the way serial ghola lives linked this incarnation to his original birth.\nImmediately, he saw what he had come to call “the net” and the elderly couple defined by criss-crossed lines, bodies visible through a shimmering of jeweled ropes—green, blue, gold, and a silver so brilliant it made his eyes ache.\nHe sensed godlike stability in these people, but something common about them. The word ordinary came to mind.
