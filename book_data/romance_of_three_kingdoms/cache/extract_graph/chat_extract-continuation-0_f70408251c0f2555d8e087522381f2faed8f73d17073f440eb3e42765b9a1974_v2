玄德曰：“吾所疑者，孔明之书也。军师还守涪关，如何？”庞统大笑曰：“主公被孔明所惑矣：彼不欲令统独成大功，故作此言以疑主公之心。心疑则致梦，何凶之有？统肝脑涂地，方称本心。主公再勿多言，来早准行。”\n\n    当日传下号令，军士五更造饭，平明上马。黄忠、魏延领军先行。玄德再与庞统约会，忽坐下马眼生前失，把庞统掀将下来。玄德跳下马，自来笼住那马。玄德曰：“军师何故乘此劣马？”庞统曰：“此马乘久，不曾如此。”玄德曰：“临阵眼生，误人性命。吾所骑白马，性极驯熟，军师可骑，万无一失。劣马吾自乘之。”遂与庞统更换所骑之马。庞统谢曰：“深感主公厚恩，虽万死亦不能报也。”遂各上马取路而进。玄德见庞统去了，心中甚觉不快，怏怏而行。\n\n    却说雒城中吴懿、刘璝听知折了泠苞，遂与众商议。张任曰：“城东南山僻有一条小路，最为要紧，某自引一军守之。诸公紧守雒城，勿得有失。”忽报汉兵分两路前来攻城。张任急引三千军，先来抄小路埋伏。见魏延兵过，张任教尽放过去，休得惊动。后见庞统军来，张任军士遥指军中大将：“骑白马者必是刘备。”张任大喜，传令教如此如此。\n\n    却说庞统迤逦前进，抬头见两山逼窄，树木丛杂；又值夏末秋初，枝叶茂盛。庞统心下甚疑，勒住马问：“此处是何地？”数内有新降军士，指道：“此处地名落凤坡。”庞统惊曰：“吾道号凤雏，此处名落凤坡，不利于吾。”令后军疾退。只听山坡前一声炮响，箭如飞蝗，只望骑白马者射来。可怜庞统竟死于乱箭之下。时年止三十六岁。后人有诗叹曰：“古岘相连紫翠堆，士元有宅傍山隈。儿童惯识呼鸠曲，闾巷曾闻展骥才。预计三分平刻削，长驱万里独徘徊。谁知天狗流星坠，不使将军衣锦回。”先是东南有童谣云：“一凤并一龙，相将到蜀中。才到半路里，凤死落坡东。风送雨，雨随风，隆汉兴时蜀道通，蜀道通时只有龙。”\n\n    当日张任射死庞统，汉军拥塞，进退不得，死者大半。前军飞报魏延。魏延忙勒兵欲回，奈山路逼窄，厮杀不得。又被张任截断归路，在高阜处用强弓硬弩射来。魏延心慌。有新降蜀兵曰：“不如杀奔雒城下，取大路而进。”延从其言，当先开路，杀\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
