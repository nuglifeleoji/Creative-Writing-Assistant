No wallets of currency would ever be produced here. The closest thing might be a thin case of translux out of whose poison-guarded interior would come thinner sheets of ridulian crystal with very large numbers inscribed on them by unforgeable dataprint.\n“This is a bank,” Teg said.\n“What?” Muzzafar had been staring at the closed door in the opposite wall. “Oh, yes. She’ll be along presently.”\n“She is watching us now, of course.”\nMuzzafar did not answer but he looked gloomy.\nTeg glanced around him. Had anything been changed since his previous visit? He saw no significant alterations. He wondered if shrines such as this one had undergone much change at all over the eons. There was a dewcarpet on the floor as soft as brantdown and as white as the underbelly of a fur whale. It shimmered with a false sense of wetness that only the eye detected. A bare foot (not that this place had ever seen a bare foot) would feel caressing dryness.\nThere was a narrow table about two meters long almost in the center of the room. The top was at least twenty\nmillimeters thick. Teg guessed it was Danian jacaranda. The deep brown surface had been polished to a sheen that drank the vision and revealed far underneath veins like river currents. There were only four admiral’s chairs around the table, chairs crafted by a master artisan from the same wood as the table, cushioned on seat and back with lyrleather of the exact tone of the polished wood.\nOnly four chairs. More would have been an overstatement. He had not tried one of the chairs before and he did not seat himself now, but he knew what his flesh would find there—comfort almost up to the level of a despised chairdog. Not quite at that degree of softness and conformity to bodily shape, of course. Too much comfort could lure the sitter into relaxation. This room and its furnishings said: “Be comfortable here but remain alert.”\nYou not only had to have your wits about you in this place but also a great power of violence behind you, Teg thought. He had summed it up that way before and his opinion had not changed.\nThere were no windows but the ones he had seen from the outside had danced with lines of light—energy barriers to repel intruders and prevent escape. Such barriers brought their own dangers, Teg knew, but the implications were important. Just keeping the energy flow in them would feed a large city for the lifetime of its longest-lived inhabitant.\nThere was nothing casual about this display of wealth.\nThe door that Muzzafar watched opened with a gentle click.\nDanger!\nA woman in a shimmering golden robe swept into the room. Lines of red-orange danced in the fabric.\nShe is old!\nTeg had not expected her to be this ancient. Her face was a wrinkled mask. The eyes were deeply set green ice. Her nose was an elongated beak whose shadow touched thin\nlips and repeated the sharp angle of the chin. A black Skullcap almost covered her gray hair.\nMuzzafar bowed.\n“Leave us,” she said.\nHe left without a word, going out through the door by which she had entered. When the door closed behind him, Teg said, “Honored Matre.”\n“So you recognize this as a bank.” Her voice carried only a Slight trembling.\n“Of course.”\n“There are always means of transferring large sums or selling power,” she said. “I do not speak of the power that runs factories but of the power that runs people.”\n“And that usually passes under the strange names of government or society or civilization,” Teg said.\n“I suspected you would be very intelligent,” she said. She pulled out a chair and sat but did not indicate that Teg should seat himself. “I think of myself as a banker. That saves a lot of muddy and distressful circumlocutions.”\nTeg did not respond. There seemed no need. He continued to study her.\n“Why are you looking at me like that?” she demanded.\n“| did not expect you to be this old,” he said.\n“Heh, heh, heh. We have many surprises for you, Bashar. Later, a younger Honored Matre may murmur her name to mark you. Praise Dur if that happens.”\nHe nodded, not understanding much of what she said.\n“This is also a very old building,” she said. “I watched you when you came in. Does that surprise you, too?”\n“No.”\n“This building has remained essentially unchanged for several thousand years. It is built of materials that will last much longer still.”\nHe glanced at the table.\n“Oh, not the wood. But underneath, it’s polastine, polaz, and pormabat. The three P-Os are never sneered at where\nnecessity calls for them.”\nTeg remained silent.\n“Necessity,” she said. “Do you object to any of the necessary things that have been done to you?”\n“My objections don’t matter,” he said. What was she getting at? Studying him, of course. As he studied her.\n“Do you think others have ever objected to what you did to them?”\n“Undoubtedly.”\n“You're a natural commander, Bashar. | think you’ll be very valuable to us.”\n“I’ve always thought | was most valuable to myself.”\n“Bashar! Look at my eyes!”\nHe obeyed, seeing little flecks of orange drifting in across the whites. The sense of peril was acute.\n“If you ever see my eyes fully orange, beware!” she said. “You will have offended me beyond my ability to tolerate.”\nHe nodded.\n“I like it that you can command but you cannot command me! You command the muck and that is the only function we have for such as you.”\n“The muck?”\nShe waved a hand, a negligent motion. “Out there. You know them. Their curiosity is narrow gauge. No great issues ever enter their awareness.”\n“I thought that was what you meant.”\n“We work to keep it that way,” she said. “Everything goes to them through a tight filter, which excludes all but that which has immediate survival value.”\n“No great issues,” he said.\n“You are offended but it doesn’t matter,” she said. “To those out there, a great issue is: ‘Will | eat today?’ ‘Do | have shelter tonight that will not be invaded by attackers or vermin?’ Luxury? Luxury is the possession of a drug ora member of the opposite sex who can, for a time, keep the beast at bay.”\nAnd you are the beast, he thought.\n“I am taking some time with you, Bashar, because | see that you could be more valuable to us even than Muzzafar. And he is extremely valuable indeed. Even now, we are repaying him for bringing you to us in a receptive condition.”\nWhen Teg still remained silent, she chuckled. “You do not think you are receptive?”\nTeg held himself quiet. Had they given him some drug in his food? He saw the flickering of doubled vision but the movements of violence had receded as the orange flecks left the Honored Matre’s eyes. Her feet were to be avoided, though. They were deadly weapons.\n“It’s just that you think of the muck in the wrong way,” she said. “Luckily, they are most self-limiting. They know this somewhere in the damps of their deepest consciousness but cannot spare the time to deal with that or anything else except the immediate scramble for survival.”\n“They cannot be improved?” he asked.\n“They must not be improved! Oh, we see to it that self- improvement remains a great fad among them. Nothing real about it, of course.”\n“Another luxury they must be denied,” he said.\n“Not a luxury! Nonexistent! It must be occluded at all times behind a barrier that we like to call protective ignorance.”\n“What you don’t know cannot hurt you.”\n“I don’t like your tone, Bashar.”\nAgain, the orange flecks danced in her eyes. The sense of violence diminished, however, as she once more chuckled. “The thing you beware of is the opposite of what-you-don’t- know. We teach that new knowledge can be dangerous. You see the obvious extension: All new knowledge is non- Survival!”\nThe door behind the Honored Matre opened and Muzzafar returned. It was a changed Muzzafar, his face flushed, his\neyes bright. He stopped behind the Honored Matre’s chair.\n“One day, | will be able to permit you behind me this way,” she said. “It is in my power to do this.”\nWhat had they done to Muzzafar? Teg wondered. The man looked almost drugged.\n“You do see that | have power?” she asked.\nHe cleared his throat. “That’s obvious.”\n“Lam a banker, remember? We have just made a deposit with our loyal Muzzafar. Do you thank us, Muzzafar?”\n“|I do, Honored Matre.” His voice was hoarse.\n“I’m sure you understand this kind of power generally, Bashar,” she said. “The Bene Gesserit trained you well. They are quite talented but not, | fear, as talented as we are,”\n“And | am told you are quite numerous,” he said.\n“Our numbers are not the key, Bashar. Power such as ours has a way of becoming channeled so that it can be controlled by small numbers.”\nShe was like a Reverend Mother, he thought, in the way she could appear to answer without revealing much.\n“In essence,” she said, “power such as ours is allowed to become the substance of survival for many people. Then, the threat of withdrawal is all that’s required for us to rule.” She glanced over her shoulder. “Would you wish us to withdraw our favor from you, Muzzafar?”\n“No, Honored Matre.” He was actually trembling!\n“You have found a new drug,” Teg said.\nHer laughter was spontaneous and loud, almost raucous. “No, Bashar! We have an old one.”\n“And you would make an addict of me?”\n“Like all the others we control, Bashar, you have a choice: death or obedience.”\n“That is a rather old choice,” he agreed. What was her immediate threat? He could sense no violence. Quite the contrary. His doubled vision showed him broken glimpses of\nextremely sensuous overtones. Did they think they could imprint him?\nShe smiled at him, a knowing expression with something frigid under it.\n“Will he serve us well, Muzzafar?”\n“| believe so, Honored Matre.”\nTeg frowned in thought. There was something deeply evil about this pair. They went against every morality by which he modeled his behavior. It was well to remember that neither of them knew this strange thing that had speeded his reactions.\nThey seemed to be enjoying his puzzled discomfiture.\nTeg took some reassurance from the realization that neither of these two really enjoyed life. He could see that in them clearly with eyes the Sisterhood had educated. The Honored Matre and Muzzafar had forgotten or, most likely, abandoned everything that supported the survival of joyous humans. He thought they probably no longer were capable of finding a real wellspring of joy in their own flesh. Theirs would have to be mostly a voyeur’s existence, the eternal observer, always remembering what it had been like before they had taken the turning into whatever it was they had become. Even when they wallowed in the performance of something that once had meant gratification, they would have to reach for new extremes each time just to touch the edges of their own memories.\nThe Honored Matre’s grin widened, showing a line of gleaming white teeth. “Look at him, Muzzafar. He has not", ".\nThey seemed to be enjoying his puzzled discomfiture.\nTeg took some reassurance from the realization that neither of these two really enjoyed life.

He has not the slightest conception of what we can do.”\nTeg heard this but he also saw with eyes trained by the Bene Gesserit. Not a milligram of naivete remained in either of these two. Nothing was expected to surprise them. Nothing could be truly new for them. Still, they plotted and devised, hoping that this extreme would produce the remembered thrill. They knew it would not, of course, and they expected to carry away from the experience only more\nburning rage out of which to fashion another attempt at the unreachable. That was how their thinking went.\nTeg designed a smile for them, using all of the skills he had learned at Bene Gesserit hands. It was a smile full of compassion, of understanding and real pleasure in his own existence. He knew it for the most deadly insult he could hurl at them and he saw it hit. Muzzafar glowered at him. The Honored Matre went from orange-eyed rage to an abrupt surprise and then, quite slowly, to dawning pleasure. She had not expected this! It was something new!\n“Muzzafar,” she said, the orange receding from her eyes, “bring the Honored Matre who has been chosen to mark our Bashar.”\nTeg, his doubled vision showing the immediate peril, understood at last. He could feel awareness of his own future spreading outward like waves as the power grew in him. The wild change in him was continuing! He felt the energy expand. With it came understanding and choices. He saw himself as the whirlwind rampaging through this building—bodies scattered behind him (Muzzafar and the Honored Matre among them) and the whole complex looking like an abattoir when he departed.\nMust I do that? he wondered.\nFor each one he killed, more would have to be killed. He saw the necessity of it, though, as he saw at last the Tyrant’s design. The pain he could see for himself almost made him cry out but he held it back.\n“Yes, bring this Honored Matre to me,” he said, knowing that this would be one less for him to seek out and destroy elsewhere in the building. The room of the scanlyzer controls must be taken out first.\nO you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.\n—SIGN OVER ARRAKEEN LANDING FIELD (HISTORICAL RECORDS: DAR-ES-BALAT)\nIi watched a snow-flutter of falling blossoms against the silvery sky of a Rakian morning. There was an opalescent sheen to the sky that, despite all of her preparatory briefings, she had not anticipated. Rakis held many surprises. The smell of mock orange was powerful here at the edge of the Dar-es-Balat roof garden, overriding all other odors.\nNever believe that you have plumbed the depths of any place... or ofany human, she reminded herself.\nConversation was ended out here but not the echoes of the spoken thoughts they had exchanged only minutes ago. All agreed, though, that it was time for action. Soon, Sheeana would “dance a worm” for them and once more demonstrate her mastery.\nWaff and a new priestly representative would share this “holy event” but Taraza was sure neither of them knew the real nature of what they were about to witness. Waff bore watching, of course. He still carried that air of irritated disbelief in everything he saw or heard. It was a strange mixture with his underlying awe at being on Rakis. The catalyst was obviously his rage over the fact that fools ruled here.\nOdrade returned from the meeting room and stopped beside Taraza.\n“lam extremely disquieted by the reports from Gammu,” Taraza said. “Do you bring something new?”\n“No. Things are obviously still chaotic there.”\n“Tell me, Dar, what do you think we should do?”\n“| keep remembering the Tyrant’s words to Chenoeh: ‘The Bene Gesserit are so close to what they should be, yet so far.’”\nTaraza pointed at the open desert beyond the museum city’s qanat. “He’s still out there, Dar. I’m sure of it.” Taraza turned to face Odrade. “And Sheeana speaks to him.”\n“He told so many lies,” Odrade said.\n“But he didn’t lie about his own incarnation. Remember what he said. ‘Every descendant part of me will carry some of my awareness locked away within it, lost and helpless— pearls of me moving blindly in the sand, caught in an endless dream.’”\n“You bank a great deal on your belief in the power of that dream,” Odrade said.\n“We must recover the Tyrant’s design! All of it!”\nOdrade sighed but did not speak.\n“Never underestimate the power of an idea,” Taraza said. “The Atreides were ever philosophers in their governance. Philosophy is always dangerous because it promotes the creation of new ideas.”\nStill, Odrade did not respond.\n“The worm carries it all within him, Dar! All of the forces he set in motion are still in him.”\n“Are you trying to convince me or yourself, Tar?”\n“Lam punishing you, Dar. Just as the Tyrant is still punishing us.”\n“For not being what we should be? Ahh, here come Sheeana and the others.”\n“The worm’s language, Dar. That is the important thing.”\n“If you say so, Mother Superior.”\nTaraza sent an angry stare at Odrade, who moved forward to greet the newcomers. There was a disturbing gloom in Odrade.\nThe presence of Sheeana, though, restored Taraza’s sense of purpose. An alert little thing, Sheeana. Very good\nmaterial. Sheeana had demonstrated her dance the previous night, performing in the great museum room against a tapestry background, an exotic dance against an exotic spice-fiber hanging with its image of desert and worms. She appeared to be almost a part of the hanging, a figure projected forward from the stylized dunes and their elaborately detailed coursing worms. Taraza recalled how Sheeana’s brown hair had been thrown outward by the whirling movements of the dance, swinging in a fuzzy arc. Sidelighting accented the reddish glints in her hair. Her eyes had been closed but it was not a face in repose. Excitement betrayed itself in the passionate set of her wide mouth, the flaring of her nostrils, the forward thrust of her chin. Her motions had conveyed an inner sophistication that belied her youth.\nThe dance is her language, Taraza thought. Odrade is correct. Seeing it, we will learn it.\nWaff had something of a withdrawn look this morning. It was difficult to determine if his eyes were looking outward or inward.\nWith Waff was Tulushan, a darkly handsome Rakian, the priesthood’s chosen representative at today’s “holy event.” Taraza, meeting him at the demonstration dance, had found it extraordinary how Tulushan never needed to say “but,” and yet the word was always there in everything he uttered. A perfect bureaucrat. He rightly expected to go far but those expectations would soon encounter their ultimate surprise. She felt no pity for him at this knowledge. Tulushan was a soft-faced youth of too few standards for such a position of trust. There was more to him than met the eye, of course. And less.\nWaff moved to one side in the garden, leaving Odrade and Sheeana with Tulushan.\nThe young priest was expendable, naturally. That explained much about why he had been chosen for this venture. It told her that she had achieved the proper level of\npotential violence. Taraza did not think, though, that any of the priestly factions would dare harm Sheeana.\nWe will stay close to Sheeana.\nThey had spent a busy week since the demonstration of the whores’ sexual accomplishments. A very disturbing week, when it came to that. Odrade had been kept busy with Sheeana. Taraza would have preferred Lucilla for this educational chore but you made do with what was available and Odrade obviously was the best available on Rakis for such teaching.\nTaraza looked back toward the desert. They were waiting for the ’thopters from Keen with their cargoes of Very Important Observers. The VIOs were not yet late but crowding it as such people always did.\nSheeana seemed to be taking the sexual education well, although Taraza’s estimation of the Sisterhood’s available teaching males on Rakis was not high. Her first night here, Taraza had called in one of the servant males. Afterward, she had judged it too much trouble for the little joy and forgetfulness it provided. Besides, what was there to forget? To forget was to allow a weakness.\nNever forget!\nThat’s what the whores did, though. They traded in forgetfulness. And they had not the least awareness of the Tyrant’s continuing viselike hold on human destiny nor of the need to break that hold.\nTaraza had listened secretly to the previous day’s session between Sheeana and Odrade.\nWhat was | listening for?\nYoung girl and teacher had been out here in the roof garden, facing each other on two benches, a portable Ixian damper hiding their words from anyone who did not have the coded translator. The suspensor-buoyed damper hovered over the two like a strange umbrella, a black disc projecting distortions that hid the precise movements of lips and the sounds of voices.\nTo Taraza, standing within the long meeting room, the tiny translator in her left ear, the lesson had occurred like an equally distorted memory.\nWhen I was taught these things, we had not seen what the whores of the Scattering could do.\n“Why do we Say it’s the complexity of sex?” Sheeana asked. “The man you sent last night kept saying that.”\n“Many believe they understand it, Sheeana. Perhaps no one has ever understood it, because such words require more of the mind than they do of the flesh.”\n“Why must I not use any of the things we saw the Face Dancers do?”\n“Sheeana, complexity hides within complexity. Great deeds and foul ones have been done at the goading of sexual forces. We speak of ‘sexual strength’ and ‘sexual energies’ and such things as ‘the overmounting urge of desire.’ | don’t deny that such things are observable. But what we are looking at here is a force so powerful that it can destroy you and everything you hold worthwhile.”\n“That’s what I’m trying to understand. What is it the whores are doing wrong?”\n“They ignore the species at its work, Sheeana. | think you can already sense this. The Tyrant certainly knew about it. What was his Golden Path but a vision of sexual forces at work recreating humankind endlessly?”\n“And the whores don’t create?”\n“They mostly try to control their", " because such words require more of the mind than they do of the flesh.”\n“Why must I not use any of the things we saw the Face Dancers do?”\n“Sheeana, complexity hides within complexity. Great deeds and foul ones have been done at the goading of sexual forces. We speak of ‘sexual strength’ and ‘sexual energies’ and such things as ‘the overmounting urge of desire.’ | don’t deny that such things are observable. But what we are looking at here is a force so powerful that it can destroy you and everything you hold worthwhile.”\n“That’s what I’m trying to understand. What is it the whores are doing wrong?”\n“They ignore the species at its work, Sheeana. | think you can already sense this. The Tyrant certainly knew about it. What was his Golden Path but a vision of sexual forces at work recreating humankind endlessly?”\n“And the whores don’t create?”\n“They mostly try to control their worlds with this force.”\n“They seem to be doing that.”\n“Ahhh, but what counterforces do they call forth?”\n“| don’t understand.”\n“You know about Voice and how it can control some people?”\n“But not control everybody.”\n“Exactly. A civilization subjected to Voice over a long period develops ways of adapting to this force, preventing manipulation by those who use Voice.”\n“So there are people who know how to resist the whores?”\n“We see unmistakable signs of it. And that is one of the reasons we are here on Rakis.”\n“Will the whores come here?”\n“I’m afraid so. They want to control the core of the Old Empire because they see us as an easy conquest.”\n“Aren't you afraid they'll win?”\n“They won't win, Sheeana. Depend on it. But they are good for us.”\n“How is that?”\nSheeana’s tone echoed Taraza’s own shock at hearing such words from Odrade. How much did Odrade suspect? In the next instant, Taraza understood and she wondered if the lesson was equally understandable to the young girl.\n“The core is static, Sheeana. We have been almost at a standstill for thousands of years. Life and movement are ‘out there’ with the people of the Scattering who resist the whores. Whatever we do, we must make that resistance even stronger.”\nThe sound of approaching ‘thopters broke Taraza from her reverie of remembrance. The VIOs were arriving from Keen. Still at some distance, but the sound carried far in the clear air.\nOdrade’s teaching method was a good one, Taraza had to admit as she scanned the sky for a first glimpse of the 'thopters. Apparently they were coming in low and from the other side of the building. That was the wrong direction but perhaps they had taken the VIOs on a short excursion over the remains of the Tyrant’s wall. Many people were curious about the place where Odrade had found the spice hoard.\nSheeana, Odrade, Waff, and Tulushan went back into the long meeting room. They had heard the 'thopters, too. Sheeana was anxious to show her power over the worms. Taraza hesitated. There was a laboring sound in the\napproaching ‘thopters. Were they overloaded? How many observers had they brought?\nThe first 'thopter lifted over the penthouse roof and Taraza saw the armored cockpit. She recognized treachery even before the first beam arced out of the machine, slicing through her legs below the knees. She fell heavily against a potted tree, her legs completely severed. Another beam slashed out at her, slicing at an angle across her hip. The ‘thopter swept over her in an abrupt roar of booster jets and banked away to the left.\nTaraza clung to the tree, shunting the agony aside. She managed to cut off most of the bloodflow from her wounds but the pain was great. Not as great as the spice agony, though, she reminded herself. That helped but she knew she was doomed. She heard shouts and the multiple sounds of violence all around the museum now.\n| have won! Taraza thought.\nOdrade darted from the penthouse and bent over Taraza. They said nothing but Odrade showed that she understood by putting her forehead to Taraza’s temple. It was the ages- old cue of the Bene Gesserit. Taraza began pouring her life into Odrade—Other Memories, hopes, fears... everything.\nOne of them might yet escape.\nSheeana watched from the penthouse, staying where she had been ordered to wait. She knew what was happening out there in the roof garden. This was the ultimate mystery of the Bene Gesserit and every postulant was aware of it.\nWaff and Tulushan, already out of the room when the attack came, did not return.\nSheeana shuddered with apprehension.\nAbruptly, Odrade stood and ran back into the penthouse. There was a wild look in her eyes but she moved with purpose. Leaping up, she gathered glowglobes, grabbing them in bundles by their toggle cords. She thrust several bundles into Sheeana’s hands and Sheeana felt her body grow lighter with the lift of the globes’ suspensor fields.\nTrailing more clusters of the globes beyond their field range, Odrade hurried across to the narrow end of the room where a grill in the wall indicated what she sought. With Sheeana’s help, she lifted the grill out of its slots, revealing a deep airshaft. The light of the clustered glowglobes showed rough walls inside.\n“Hold the globes close to get the maximum field effect,” Odrade said. “Push them away to lower yourself. In you go.”\nSheeana clutched the toggle cords in a sweaty hand and hopped over the sill. She let herself fall, then fearfully clutched the globes close. Light from above told her Odrade was following.\nAt the bottom, they emerged into a pump room, the susurrations of many fans a background for the sounds of violence from outside.\n“We must get to the no-room and then to the desert,” Odrade said. “All of these machinery systems are interconnected. There will be a passage.”\n“Is she dead?” Sheeana whispered.\n“Yes.”\n“Poor Mother Superior.”\n“I am the Mother Superior now, Sheeana. At least temporarily.” She pointed upward. “Those were the whores attacking us. We must hurry.”\nThe world is for the living. Who are they? We dared the dark to reach the white and warm. She was the wind when the wind was in my way.\nAlive at noon, | perished in her form. Who rise from the flesh to spirit know the fall: The word outleaps the world and light is all.\n—THEODORE ROETHKE (HISTORICAL QUOTATIONS: DAR-ES-BALAT)\nt required little conscious volition for Teg to become the\nwhirlwind. He had recognized at last the nature of the threat from the Honored Matres. Recognition fitted itself into the blurred requirements made upon him by the new Mentat awareness that went with his magnified speed.\nMonstrous threat required monstrous countermeasures. Blood spattered him as he drove himself through the headquarters building, slaughtering everyone he met.\nAs he had learned from his Bene Gesserit teachers, the great problem of the human universe lay in how you managed procreation. He could hear the voice of his first teacher as he carried destruction through the building.\n“You may think of this only as sexuality but we prefer the more basic term: procreation. It has many facets and offshoots and it has apparently unlimited energy. The emotion called ‘love’ is only one small aspect.”\nTeg crushed the throat of a man standing rigidly in his path and, at last, found the control room for the building’s defenses. Only one man was seated in it, his right hand almost touching a red key on the console in front of him.\nWith a slashing left hand, Teg almost decapitated the man. The body tipped backward in slow motion, blood welling from the gaping neck.\nThe Sisterhood ts right to call them whores!\nYou could drag humankind almost anywhere by manipulating the enormous energies of procreation. You could goad humans into actions they would never have believed possible. One of his teachers had said it directly:\n“This energy must have an outlet. Bottle it up and it becomes monstrously dangerous. Redirect it and it will sweep over anything in its path. This is an ultimate secret of all religions.”\nTeg was conscious of leaving more than fifty bodies behind him as he left the building. The last fatality was a soldier in camouflage uniform standing in the open doorway, apparently about to enter.\nAs he ran past apparently unmoving people and vehicles, Teg’s revved-up mind had time to reflect on what he had left behind him. Was there any consolation, he wondered, in the fact that the old Honored Matre’s last living expression was one of real surprise? Could he congratulate himself that Muzzafar would never again see his frame bush home?\nThe necessity for what he had accomplished in a few heartbeats was very clear, though, to one trained by the Bene Gesserit. Teg knew his history. There were many paradise planets in the Old Empire, probably many more among the people of the Scattering. Humans always seemed capable of trying that foolish experiment. People in such places mostly lazed along. A quick-smart analysis said this was because of the easy climates on such planets. He knew this for stupidity. It was because sexual energy was easily released in such places. Let the Missionaries of the Divided God or some denominational construct enter one of these paradises and you got outrageous violence.\n“We of the Sisterhood know,” one of Teg’s teachers had said. “We have put a flame to that fuse more than once with our Missionaria Protectiva.”\nTeg did not stop running until he was in an alley at least five kilometers from the abattoir that had been the\nheadquarters for the old Honored Matre. He knew that very little time had passed but there was something much more important upon which he had to focus. He had not killed every occupant of that building. There were eyes back there belonging to people who knew now what he could do. They had seen him kill Honored Matres. They had seen Muzzafar topple dead at his hands. The evidence of the bodies left behind and the slowed replay of recordings would tell it all.\nTeg leaned against a wall. Skin was torn from his left palm. He let himself return to normal time as he watched blood oozing from the wound. The blood was almost black.\nMore oxygen in my blood?\nHe was panting but not as much as these exertions would seem to require.\nWhat has happened to me?\nIt was something from his Atreides ancestry, he knew. Crisis had tipped him over into another dimension of human possibilities. Whatever the transformation, it was profound. He could see outward now into many necessities. And the people he had passed on his run to this alley had seemed like statues.\nWill | ever think of them as muck?\nIt could only happen if he let it happen, he knew. But the temptation was there and he allowed himself a brief commiseration for the Honored Matres. Great Temptation had toppled them into their own muck.\nWhat to do now?\nThe main line lay open to him. There was a man here in Ysai, one man who would be sure to know everyone Teg required. Teg looked around the alley. Yes, that man was near.\nThe fragrance of flowers and herbs wafted to Teg from somewhere down this alley. He moved toward this fragrance, aware that it led him where he needed to go and that no"], "parameters": {"model": "text-embedding-ada-002"}}, "key": "embeddings_71039200453d5beec52f857f3b030aada332385cbd67c5acc520b87e767f7383_v2"}
