In the maintenance of such a power structure, certain symbols are kept out of the reach of common understanding— symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity. Symbol-secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub-languages, each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power. With this insight into a power process, our Imperial Security Force must be ever alert to the formation of sub-languages.\n—LECTURE TO THE ARRAKEEN WAR COLLEGE BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n44] tis perhaps unnecessary to tell you,” Farad’n said, “but\nto avoid any errors l'Il announce that a mute has been stationed with orders to kill you both should | show signs of succumbing to witchery.”\nHe did not expect to see any effect from these words. Both the Lady Jessica and Idaho gratified his expectations.\nFarad’n had chosen with care the setting for this first examination of the pair, Shaddam’s old State Audience Chamber. What it lacked in grandeur it made up for with exotic appointments. Outside it was a winter afternoon, but the windowless chamber’s lighting simulated a timeless summer day bathed in golden light from artfully scattered glowglobes of the purest Ixian crystal.\nThe news from Arrakis filled Farad’n with quiet elation. Leto, the male twin, was dead, killed by an assassin-tiger. Ghanima, the surviving sister, was in the custody of her aunt and reputedly was a hostage. The full report did much to explain the presence of Idaho and the Lady Jessica.\nSanctuary was what they wanted. Corrino spies reported an uneasy truce on Arrakis. Alia had agreed to submit herself to a test called “the Trial of Possession,” the purpose of which had not been fully explained. However, no date had been set for this trial and two Corrino spies believed it might never take place. This much was certain, though: there had been fighting between desert Fremen and the Imperial Military Fremen, an abortive civil war which had brought government to a temporary standstill. Stilgar’s holdings were now neutral ground, designated after an exchange of hostages. Ghanima evidently had been considered one of these hostages, although the working of this remained unclear.\nJessica and Idaho had been brought to the audience securely bound in suspensor chairs. Both were held down by deadly thin strands of shigawire which would cut flesh at the slightest struggle. Two Sardaukar troopers had brought them, checked the bindings, and had gone away silently.\nThe warning had, indeed, been unnecessary. Jessica had seen the armed mute standing against a wall at her right, an old but efficient projectile weapon in his hand. She allowed her gaze to roam over the room’s exotic inlays. The broad leaves of the rare iron bush had been set with eye pearls and interlaced to form the center crescent of the domed ceiling. The floor beneath her was alternate blocks of diamond wood and kabuzu shell arranged within rectangular borders of passaquet bones. These had been set on end, laser-cut and polished. Selected hard materials decorated the walls in stress-woven patterns which outlined the four positions of the Lion symbol claimed by descendants of the late Shaddam IV. The lions were executed in wild gold.\nFarad’n had chosen to receive the captives while standing. He wore uniform shorts and a light golden jacket of elf-silk open at the throat. His only decoration was the princely starburst of his royal family worn at the left breast. He was attended by the Bashar Tyekanik wearing Sardaukar\ndress tans and heavy boots, an ornate lasegun carried in a front holster at the belt buckle. Tyekanik, whose heavy visage was known to Jessica from Bene Gesserit reports, stood three paces to the left and slightly behind Farad’n. A single throne of dark wood sat on the floor near the wall directly behind the two.\n“Now,” Farad’n said, addressing Jessica, “do you have anything to say?”\n“| would inquire why we are bound thus?” Jessica said, indicating the shigawire.\n“We have only just now received reports from Arrakis to explain your presence here,” Farad’n said. “Perhaps I'll have you released presently.” He smiled. “If you—” He broke off as his mother entered by the State doors behind the Captives.\nWensicia hurried past Jessica and Idaho without a glance, presented a small message cube to Farad’n, actuated it. He studied the glowing face, glancing occasionally at Jessica, back to the cube. The glowing face went dark and he returned the cube to his mother, indicated that she should show it to Tyekanik. While she was doing this, he scowled at Jessica.\nPresently Wensicia stationed herself at Farad’n’s right hand, the darkened cube in her hand, partly concealed ina fold of her white gown.\nJessica glanced to her right at Idaho, but he refused to meet her gaze.\n“The Bene Gesserit are displeased with me,” Farad’n said. “They believe | was responsible for the death of your grandson.”\nJessica held her face emotionless, thinking: So Ghanima’s story is to be trusted, unless... She didn’t like the suspected unknowns.\nIdaho closed his eyes, opened them to glance at Jessica. She continued to stare at Farad’n. Idaho had told her about this Rhajia vision, but she’d seemed unworried. He didn’t\nknow how to catalogue her lack of emotion. She obviously knew something, though, that she wasn’t revealing.\n“This is the situation,” Farad’n said, and he proceeded to explain everything he’d learned about events on Arrakis, leaving out nothing. He concluded: “Your granddaughter Survives, but she’s reportedly in the custody of the Lady Alia. This should gratify you.”\n“Did you kill my grandson?” Jessica asked.\nFarad’n answered truthfully: “I did not. | recently learned of a plot, but it was not of my making.”\nJessica looked at Wensicia, saw the gloating expression on that heart-shaped face, thought: Her doing! The lioness schemes for her cub. This was a game the lioness might live to regret.\nReturning her attention to Farad’n, Jessica said: “But the Sisterhood believes you killed him.”\nFarad’n turned to his mother. “Show her the message.”\nAs Wensicia hesitated, he spoke with an edge of anger which Jessica noted for future use. “I said show it to her!”\nFace pale, Wensicia presented the message face of the cube to Jessica, activated it. Words flowed across the face, responding to Jessica’s eye movements: “Bene Gesserit Council on Wallach IX files formal protest against House Corrino in assassination of Leto Atreides ll. Arguments and showing of evidence are assigned to Landsraad Internal Security Commission. Neutral ground will be chosen and names of judges will be submitted for approval by all parties. Your immediate response required. Sabit Rekush for the Landsraad.”\nWensicia returned to her son’s side.\n“How do you intend to respond?” Jessica asked.\nWensicia said: “Since my son has not yet been formally invested as head of House Corrino, | will—Where are you going?” This last was addressed to Farad’n who, as she spoke, turned and headed for a side door near the watchful mute.\nFarad’n paused, half turned. “I’m going back to my books and the other pursuits which hold much more interest for me.”\n“How dare you?” Wensicia demanded. A dark flush spread from her neck up across her cheeks.\n“I'll dare quite a few things in my own name,” Farad’n said. “You have made decisions in my name, decisions which I find extremely distasteful. Either | will make the decisions in my own name from this point on or you can find yourself another heir for House Corrino!”\nJessica passed her gaze swiftly across the participants in this confrontation, seeing the real anger in Farad’n. The Bashar Aide stood stiffly at attention, trying to make it appear that he had heard nothing. Wensicia hesitated on the brink of screaming rage. Farad’n appeared perfectly willing to accept any outcome from his throw of the dice. Jessica rather admired his poise, seeing many things in this confrontation which could be of value to her. It seemed that the decision to send assassin tigers against her grandchildren had been made without Farad’n’s knowledge. There could be little doubt of his truthfulness in saying he’d learned of the plot after its inception. There was no mistaking the real anger in his eyes as he stood there, ready to accept any decision.\nWensicia took a deep, trembling breath. Then: “Very well. The formal investiture will take place tomorrow. You may act in advance of it now.” She looked at Tyekanik, who refused to meet her gaze.\nThere'll be a screaming fight once mother and son get out of here, Jessica thought. But I do believe he has won. She allowed her thoughts to return then to the message from the Landsraad. The Sisterhood had judged their messengers with a finesse which did credit to Bene Gesserit planning. Hidden in the formal notice of protest was a message for Jessica’s eyes. The fact of the message said the Sisterhood’s\nspies knew Jessica’s situation and they’d gauged Farad’n with a superb nicety to guess he’d show it to his captive.\n“ld like an answer to my question,” Jessica said, addressing herself to Farad’n as he returned to face her.\n“I shall tell the Landsraad that | had nothing to do with this assassination,” Farad’n said. “I will add that | share the Sisterhood’s distaste for the manner of it, although | cannot be completely displeased at the outcome. My apologies for any grief this may have caused you. Fortune passes everywhere.”\nFortune passes everywhere! Jessica thought. That’d been a favorite saying of her Duke, and there’d been something in Farad’n’s manner which said he knew this. She forced herself to ignore the possibility that they’d really killed Leto. She had to assume that Ghanima’s fears for Leto had motivated a complete revelation of the twins’ plan. The smugglers would put Gurney in position to meet Leto then and the Sisterhood’s devices would be carried out. Leto had to be tested. He had to be. Without the testing he was doomed as Alia was doomed. And Ghanima.. . Well, that could be faced later. There was no way to send the pre-born before the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.\nJessica allowed herself a deep sigh. “Sooner or later,” she said, “it’ll occur to someone that you and my granddaughter could unite our two Houses and heal old wounds.”\n“This has already been mentioned to me as a possibility,” Farad’n said, glancing briefly at his mother. “My response was that I’d prefer to await the outcome of recent events on Arrakis. There’s no need for a hasty decision.”\n“There’s always the possibility that you’ve already played into my daughter’s hands.” Jessica said.\nFarad’n stiffened. “Explain!”\n“Matters on Arrakis are not as they may seem to you,” Jessica said. “Alia plays her own game, Abomination’s game. My granddaughter is in danger unless Alia can contrive a way to use her.”\n“You expect me to believe that you and your daughter oppose each other, that Atreides fights Atreides?”\nJessica looked at Wensicia, back to Farad’n. “Corrino fights Corrino.”\nA wry smile moved Farad’n’s lips. “Well taken\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_82865a737a6de78498df56e19ee73ad158ff0ddfd4ebc4426016cd09995a9057_v2"}
