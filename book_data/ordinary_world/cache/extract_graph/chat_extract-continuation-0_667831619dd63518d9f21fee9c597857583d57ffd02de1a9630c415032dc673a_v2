\n　　当然，在起先的时候，他和那个叫郝红梅的女生都是毫不相干地各自拿了自己的馍就离开了。 \n　　不知是哪一天，她走过来的时候，看了他一眼。他也看了她一眼。尽管谁也没说话，但实际上说了。人们在生活中常常有一种没有语言的语言。从此以后，这种眼睛的“交谈”就越来越多了。 \n　　孙少平发现，郝红梅实际上是班里最漂亮的女生。只是因为她穿戴破烂，再加上一脸菜色，才使得所有的人都没有发现这一点。这种年龄的男青年，又刚刚有了一点文化，往往爱给一些“洋女生”献殷勤。尤其是刚从农村来的男生，在他们的眼里，城里干部的女儿都好象是下凡的仙女。当然，这般年龄的男女青年还说不上正经八板地谈恋爱，但他们无疑已经浮浅地懂得了这种事，并且正因为刚懂得，因此比那些有过经历的人具有更大的激情。唉，谁没有经过这样的年龄呢？在这个维特式的骚动不安的年龄里，异性之间任何微小的情感，都可能在一个少年的内心掀起狂风巨浪！ \n　　孙少平目前还没有到这样的地步。他只是感到，在他如此潦倒的生活中，有一个姑娘用这样亲切而善意的目光在关注他，使他感到无限温暖。她那可怜的、清瘦的脸颊，她那细长的脖项，她那刚能遮住羞丑的破烂衣衫，都在他的内心荡漾起一种春水般的波澜。 \n　　他们用眼睛这样“交谈”了一些日子后，终于有一天，她取完那两个黑面馍，迟疑地走到他跟前，小声问他：“那天，老师没收了你的那本书，叫什么名字？” \n　　“《红岩》。我在县文化馆借的。”他拿黑面馍的手微微抖着，回答她。她离他这么近，他再也不敢看她了。他很不自在地把头低下，看着自己手里的那两个黑东西。“那里面有个江姐……”她本来不紧张，但看他这样不自在，声音也有点不自然了。 \n　　他赶忙说：“是。后来牺牲了……很悲壮！”他加添了一个自认为很出色的词，头仍然低着。 \n　　“还有一个双枪老太婆。”她又说。 \n　　“你也看过这书？”他现在才敢抬起眼皮看了她一眼。“我没看过。以前听我爸说过里面的故事。” \n　　“你爸？你爸看过？” \n　　“嗯。” \n　　“你爸在？……”少平显然有点惊讶这位穿戴破烂的女生，她父亲竟然看过《红岩》，因此弄不明白她父亲是干什么的了。“我爸是农民，成份不好，是地主，不，我爷爷是地主，所以……” \n　　“那你爸上过学？” \n　　“我爸没上过。我爷上过。我爸的字是我爷教的。我爷早死了……我没看\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a young man who feels warmth from a girl
