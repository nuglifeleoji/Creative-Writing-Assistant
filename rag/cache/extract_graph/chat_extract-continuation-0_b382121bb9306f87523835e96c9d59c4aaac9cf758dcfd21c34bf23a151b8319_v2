The nullfield was turned off and she felt gravity. The hatch directly in front of her opened. Temperature pleasantly warm. Noise out there. Children playing some competitive game?\nLuggage floating behind, she stepped onto a short flight of steps and saw that the noise did indeed come from a large group of children in a nearby field. In their high teens and female. They were butting a suspensor float-ball back and forth, shouting and screaming as they played.\nStaged for our benefit?\nOdrade thought it likely. There probably were two thousand young women on that field.\nLook how many recruits we have coming along!\nNo one to greet her but Odrade saw a familiar structure down a paved lane to her left. Obvious Spacing Guild artifact with a recent tower added. She spoke of the tower as she glanced around her, giving the implaned transmitter\ndata on a change from Teg’s groundplan. Nobody who had ever seen a Guild building could mislabel this place, though.\nSo this was like other Junction planets. Somewhere in Guild records there doubtless was a serial number and code for it. So long under Guild control before Honored Matres that, in these first moments of debarking, getting their “ground legs,” everything around them could be seen to have that special Guild flavor. Even the playing field— designed for outdoor meetings of Navigators in their giant containers of melange gas.\nThe Guild flavor: It was compounded of Ixian technology and Navigator design—buildings wrapped around space in the most energy-conserving way, paths direct; few slide- walks. They were wasteful and only the gravity-bound needed them. No flowery plantings near the Landing Flat. They were susceptible to accidental destruction. And that permanent grayness to all construction—not silver but as dull as Tleilaxu skin.\nThe structure on her left was a great bulging shape with extrusions, some rounded and some angular. This had been no lavish hostelry. Opulent little nooks, of course, but those were rare, built for VVIPs, mostly inspectors from the Guild.\nOnce more, Teg is right. Honored Matres kept existing structures, remodeling minimally. A tower!\nOdrade reminded herself then: This is not only another world but also another society with its own social glue. She had a handle on that from Sharing with Murbella but did not think she had plumbed what held Honored Matres together. Surely not just a lusting after power.\n“We'll walk,” she said and led the way down the paved lane toward the giant structure.\nGoodbye, Clairby. Blow your ship as soon as you can. Let it be our first great surprise for Honored Matres.\nThe Guild structure loomed higher as they approached.\nThe most astonishing thing to Odrade whenever she saw one of these functional constructions was that someone had\ntaken a great deal of care in planning it. Intentional detail in everything although you sometimes had to dig for it. Budget dictated reduced quality in many choices, endurance preferred over luxury or eye appeal. Compromise and, like most compromise, satisfying no one. Guild comptrollers undoubtedly had complained at the price, and present occupants still could feel irritated at shortcomings. No matter. The thing was tangible substance. It was here to be used now. Another compromise.\nThe lobby was smaller than she had expected. Some interior changes. Only about six meters long and perhaps four meters wide. Reception slot was on their right as they entered. Odrade motioned Suipol to register their party and indicated that the rest of them should wait in the open area well within striking distance of one another. Treachery had not been ruled out.\nDortujla obviously expected it. She looked resigned.\nOdrade made a careful inspection and commented on their surroundings. Plenty of comeyes but the rest of it...\nEach time she entered one of these places, she had the sensation of being in a museum. Other Memory said hostelries of this sort had not changed significantly in eons. Even in early times she found prototypes. A glimpse of the past in the chandeliers—gigantic glittering things imitative of electric devices but furnished with glowglobes. Two of them dominated the ceiling like imaginary spaceships descending in splendor from the void.\nThere were more glimpses of the past that few transients in this age would notice. The arrangement of the reception area behind grilled slots, space for waiting with its mixture of seats and inconvenient lighting, signs directing them to services—restaurants, narcoparlors, assignation bars, Swimming and other exercise facilities, automassage rooms, and the like. Only language and script had changed from ancient times. Given an understanding of the language, the\nsigns would be recognizable to pre-space primitives. This was a temporary stopping place.\nPlenty of security installations. Some had the look of artifacts from the Scattering. Ix and Guild had never wasted gold on comeyes and sensors.\nA frenetic dance of roboservants in the reception area— darting here and there, cleaning, picking up litter, guiding newcomers. A party of four Ixians had preceded Odrade’s group. She gave them close attention. How self-important yet fearful.\nTo her Bene Gesserit eye, the people of Ix were always recognizable no matter the disguises. Basic structure of their society colored its individuals. Ixians displayed a Hogbenesque attitude toward their science: that political and economic requirements determined permissible research. That said the innocent naivete of Ixian social dreams had become the reality of bureaucratic centralism— a new aristocracy. So they were headed into a decline that would not be stopped by whatever accommodation this Ixian party made with Honored Matres.\nNo matter the outcome of our contest, Ix is dying. Witness: no great Ixian innovations in centuries.\nSuipol returned. “They ask us to wait for an escort.”\nOdrade decided to start negotiations immediately with a chat for the benefit of Suipol, the comeyes, and listeners on her no-ship.\n“Suipol, did you notice those Ixians ahead of us?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior.”\n“Mark them well. They are products of a dying society. It is naive to expect any bureaucracy to take brilliant innovations and put them to good use. Bureaucracies ask different questions. Do you know what those are?”\n“No, Mother Superior.” Spoken after a searching look at their surroundings.\nShe knows! But she sees what I’m doing. What have we here? I’ve misjudged her.\n“These are typical questions, Suipol: Who gets the credit? Who will be blamed if it causes problems? Will it shift the power structure, costing us jobs? Or will it make some subsidiary department more important?”\nSuipol nodded on cue but her glance at the comeyes might have been a little obvious. No matter.\n“These are political questions,” Odrade said. “They demonstrate how motives of bureaucracy are directly opposed to the need for adapting to change. Adaptability is a prime requirement for life to survive.”\nTime to talk directly to our hosts.\nOdrade turned her attention upward, picking a prominent comeye in a chandelier. “Note those Ixians. Their ‘mind ina deterministic universe’ has given way to ‘mind in an unlimited universe’ where anything may happen. Creative anarchy is the path to survival in this universe.”\n“Thank you for this lesson, Mother Superior.”\nBless you, Suipol.\n“After all of their experiences with us,” Suipol said, “surely they no longer question our loyalty to one another.”\nFates preserve her! This one Is ready for the Agony and may never see it.\nOdrade could only agree with the acolyte’s summation. Compliance with Bene Gesserit ways came from within, from those constantly monitored details that kept their own house in order. It was not philosophical but a pragmatic view of free will. Any claim the Sisterhood might have to making its own way in a hostile universe lay in scrupulous adherence to mutual loyalty, an agreement forged in the Agony. Chapterhouse and its few remaining subsidiaries were nurseries of an order founded in sharing and Sharing. Not based on innocence. That had been lost long ago. It was set firmly in political consciousness and a view of history independent of other laws and customs.\n“We are not machines,” Odrade said, glancing at the automata around them. “We always rely on personal\nrelationships, never knowing where those may lead us.” Tamalane stepped to Odrade’s side. “Don’t you think they should be sending us a message at the very least?” “They've already sent us a message, Tam, putting us up in a second-class hostelry. And | have responded.”\nUltimately, all things are known because you want to believe you know.\n—ZENSUNNI KOAN\nTe took a deep breath. Gamm u lay directly ahead, precisely where his navigators had said it would be when they emerged from foldspace. He stood beside a watchful Streggi seeing this in displays of his flagship’s command bay.\nStreggi did not like it that he stood on his own feet instead of riding her shoulders. She felt superfluous amidst military hardware. Her gaze kept going to the multi- projection fields at command bay center. Aides moving efficiently in and out of pods and fields, bodies draped with esoteric hardware, knew what they were doing. She had only the vaguest idea of these functions.\nThe comboard to relay Teg’s orders lay under his palms, riding there on suspensors. Its command field formed a faint blue glow around his hands. The silvery horseshoe linking him to the attack force rested lightly on his shoulders, feeling familiar there in spite of being much larger relative to his small body than comlinks of his previous lifetime.\nNone of those around him any longer questioned that this was their famous Bashar in a child’s body. They took his orders with brisk acceptance.\nThe target system looked ordinary from this distance: a sun and its captive planets. But Gammu in center focus was not ordinary. Idaho had been born there, his ghola trained there, his original memories restored there.\nAnd I was changed there.\nTeg had no explanation for what he had found in himself under the stresses of survival on Gammu. Physical speed that drained his flesh and an ability to see no-ships, to locate them in an image field like a block of space reproduced in his mind.\nHe suspected a wild outcropping in Atreides genes. Marker cells had been identified in him but not their purpose. It was the heritage Bene Gesserit Breeding Mistresses had meddled with for eons. There was little doubt they would view this ability as something potentially dangerous to them. They might use it but he would certainly lose his freedom.\nHe put these reflections out of his mind.\n“Send in the decoys.”\nAction!\nTeg felt himself assume a familiar stance. There was a sense of climbing onto a refreshing eminence when planning ended. Theories had been articulated, alternatives carefully worked out, and subordinates deployed, all thoroughly briefed. His key squad leaders had committed Gammu to memory—where partisan help might be available, every bolt hole, every known strongpoint and which access routes were most vulnerable. He had warned them especially about Futars. The possibility that humanoid beasts might be allies could not be overlooked. Rebels who had helped ghola-ldaho escape from Gammu had insisted Futars were created to hunt and kill Honored Matres. Knowing the accounts of Dortujla and others, you could almost pity Honored Matres if this were true, except that no pity could be spared for those who never showed it to others.\nThe attack was taking its designed shape—scout ships laying down a decoy barrage and heavy carriers moving into strike position. Teg became now what he thought of as “the instrument of my instruments.” It was difficult to determine which\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NULLFIELD<|>EVENT<|>The nullfield is a phenomenon that affects gravity and movement, turned off in this context to restore normal conditions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading negotiations and inspections on a Guild-controlled planet.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, focused on political and genetic manipulation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPACING GUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Spacing Guild controls interstellar travel and commerce, known for its Navigator caste and melange-dependent technology.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A violent and dominant faction that has taken control of many worlds, including former Guild territories.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ix is a technologically advanced society known for its innovations, though currently in decline due to bureaucratic stagnation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a military leader with unique abilities, planning an attack on Gammu with a focus on defeating Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is a planet with historical significance to the Bene Gesserit and the site of an upcoming military confrontation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNCTION PLANETS<|>GEO<|>Planets controlled by the Spacing Guild, used as hubs for interstellar travel and commerce.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive and manipulative faction known for genetic engineering and the creation of gholas.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a former Honored Matre who has joined the Bene Gesserit, sharing valuable intelligence.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUIPOL<|>PERSON<|>Suipol is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, assisting Odrade in negotiations and demonstrating loyalty to the Sisterhood.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Tamalane is a Bene Gesserit member who accompanies Odrade, providing counsel and support.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORTUJLA<|>PERSON<|>Dortujla is a Bene Gesserit member who expects treachery and remains vigilant during the mission.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREGGI<|>PERSON<|>Streggi is Teg's aide, concerned about her role amidst military operations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Humanoid beasts created to hunt and kill Honored Matres, potentially allies in the conflict.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the Sisterhood's efforts<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SPACING GUILD<|>Odrade inspects a Guild-controlled planet, noting its architecture and history<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Odrade negotiates with Honored Matres, aware of their power and tactics<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MURBELLA<|>Odrade has shared memories with Murbella, gaining insights into Honored Matres<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SUIPOL<|>Odrade mentors Suipol, testing her loyalty and readiness for the Agony<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TAMALANE<|>Odrade and Tamalane collaborate closely during the mission<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GAMMU<|>Teg plans a military attack on Gammu, a planet with personal significance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg serves the Bene Gesserit, using his unique abilities for their cause<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>FUTARS<|>Teg considers Futars as potential allies against Honored Matres<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit are in conflict with Honored Matres for control and survival<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACING GUILD<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Honored Matres have taken control of former Guild territories<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IX<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Ixian technology is scrutinized by the Bene Gesserit, who note its decline<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Tleilaxu and Bene Gesserit have a history of manipulation and conflict<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
