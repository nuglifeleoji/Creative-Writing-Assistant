\n　　金俊武点点头，担着粪走了。 \n　　少安匆匆地把牛吆到饲养室，给饲养员田万江把药交待下，就折转身向家里赶去。 \n　　孙少安不愿意在金俊武面前表示任何慌乱，叫这个强人笑话他。但他现在内心中充满了焦躁和不安。对于象他们这样各方面都很脆弱的家庭来说，一件小事就可能导致灾难性的混乱，甚至使一切陷于瘫痪。而眼前发生的又并不是一件小事。姐夫不仅使一家人蒙受耻辱，而且罐子村他家的生活越烂包，他这里的家庭也就要烂包的更快些——因为他和父亲绝对不可能丢开姐姐和两个孩子不管。他更知道，家里出了这样的大事，一家人都指靠他来解决。他不仅要解决事情本身，还同时要安稳一家人的情绪……他现在一路往家里走，脑子里已经开始飞快地判断各种情况。是的，这是公社出面搞的事；如果是本村，他就会立即去在各种人际关系中穿插，先找俊山叔，再找金俊武，然后找二爸，最后找田福堂……当然，还有许多人。而且他还不会都直接出面，各种交错制约的力量，就可能使问题得到解决。在双水村这个天地里，他还是有些能耐的。可姐夫是罐子村的，而这事又是公社搞的，和双水村没一点关系。他现在的能力看来无法解决这事。 \n　　怎么办？他上自家院子的土坡时，脑子里还象乱麻一般没有头绪。只有一点已经清透了：要解决这事，非要通过石圪节公社不可。但公社里除过文书刘根民是他小学同学，能说上话外，其他领导尽管都认得他，但没有什么更多的交情…… \n　　到了院子的时候，他把所有这些思绪暂时斩断。因为他首先要应付家里人的情绪。 \n　　他在家门口站了一下，让自己平静下来，然后尽量轻松一些地推开了门。 \n　　他妈，他姐，他妹，他奶，老少四个女人一见他回家来，都又惊又喜，高兴得咧开嘴笑着，一个个泪流满面，就好象久盼的大救星突然从天而降。 \n　　少安站在脚地上，为这场面感动得忍不住鼻子一酸。是呀，这些至亲至爱的人们，都把他看作是全家人的靠山。家里出了任何不幸事，他们都把希望寄托在他的身上。他怎么能辜负亲人们的期望呢？ \n　　刹那间，一种强悍的男性豪气在这个二十三岁青年的身上汹涌地鼓涨起来！ \n　　他平静地问母亲：“我爸出山去了？” \n　　他妈“嗯”了一声，接着便撩起围裙揩干脸上的泪痕，母亲意识到她不能再哭了，以免加重儿子的精神负担\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金俊武<|>PERSON<|>金俊武 is a
