Sweetness itself. Another warning signal to the knowledgeable. /’m one of those who pours sugar syrup over everything. “How nice! Such a pleasant time when we’re with you. Isn’t that beautiful! Weren’t you clever to get it so cheaply! Easily. Quickly.” Supply your own adverb.\nGreat Honored Matre was a moment composing herself. She sensed that she had been placed at a disadvantage but could not say how. She covered the moment with an enigmatic smile, then: “But | said | would release you.” She pressed something on the side of her chair and a section of the tubular cage swung aside, taking the shigawire netting with it. In the same instant, a low chair lifted from a panel in the floor directly in front of her and not a pace away.\nLucilla seated herself in the chair, knees almost touching her inquisitor. Feet. Remember they kill with their feet. She flexed her fingers, realizing then that she had been gripping her hands into fists. Damn the tensions!\n“You should have some food and drink,” Great Honored Matre said. She pushed something else on the side of her chair. A tray came up beside Lucilla—plate, spoon, a glass brimming with red liquid. Showing off her toys.\nLucilla picked up the glass.\nPoison? Smell it first.\nShe sampled the drink. Stimtea and melange! /’m hungry. Lucilla returned an empty glass to the tray. The stim on her tongue smelled sharply of melange. What is she doing?\nWooing me? Lucilla felt a flow of relief from the spice. The plate proved to hold beans in a piquant sauce. She ate it all after sampling the first bite for unwanted additives. Garlic in the sauce. She was hung up for the barest fraction of a second on Memory of this ingredient—adjunct to fine cooking, specific against werewolves, potent treatment for flatulence.\n“You find our food pleasant?”\nLucilla wiped her chin. “Very good. You are to be complimented on your chef.” Never compliment the chef in a private establishment. Chefs can be replaced. Hostess is irreplaceable. “A nice touch with garlic.”\n“We've been studying some of the library salvaged from Lampadas.” Gloating: See what you lost? “So little of interest buried in all of that prattle.”\nDoes she want you to be her librarian? Lucilla waited Silently.\n“Some of my aides think there may be clues to your witches’ nest there or, at least, a way to eliminate you quickly. So many languages!”\nDoes she need a translator? Be blunt!\n“What interests you?”\n“Very little. Who could possibly need accounts of the Butlerian Jihad?”\n“They destroyed libraries, too.”\n“Don’t patronize me!”\nShe’s sharper than we thought. Keep it blunt.\n“I thought | was the object of patronage.”\n“Listen to me, witch! You think you can be ruthless in defense of your nest but you do not understand what it is to be ruthless.”\n“I don’t think you have yet told me how | can satisfy your Curiosity.”\n“It’s your science we want, witch!” She pitched her voice lower. “Let us be reasonable. With your help we could achieve utopia.”\nAnd conquer all of your enemies and achieve orgasm every time.\n“You think science holds the keys to utopia?”\n“And better organization for our affairs.”\nRemember: Bureaucracy elevates conformity ... make that elevates “fatal stupidity” to the status of religion.\n“Paradox, Great Honored Matre. Science must be innovative. It brings change. That’s why science and bureaucracy fight a constant war.”\nDoes she know her roots?\n“But think of the power! Think of what you could control!” She doesn’t know.\nHonored Matre assumptions about control fascinated Lucilla. You controlled your universe; you did not balance with it. You looked outward, never inward. You did not train yourself to sense your own subtle responses, you produced muscles (forces, powers) to overcome everything you defined as an obstacle. Were these women blind?\nWhen Lucilla did not speak, Honored Matre said: “We found much in the library about the Bene Tleilax.\n“You joined them for many projects, witch. Multiple projects: how to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility, how to penetrate the secrets of the living cell, your Missionaria Protectiva, and something called ‘the Language of God.\nLucilla produced a tight smile. Did they fear there might be a real god out there somewhere? Give her a little taste! Be candid.\n1\n“We joined the Tleilaxu in nothing. Your people misinterpret what they found. You worry about being patronized? How do you think God would feel about it? We plant protective religions to help us. That is the Missionaria’s function. The Tleilaxu have only one religion.”\n“You organize religions?”\n“Not quite. The organizational approach to religion is always apologetic. We do not apologize.”\n“You are beginning to bore me. Why did we find so little about the God Emperor?” Pouncing!\n“Perhaps your people destroyed it.”\n“Ahhh, then you do have an interest in him.”\nAnd so do you, Madame Spider!\n“|I would have presumed, Great Honored Matre, that Leto Il and his Golden Path were subjects of study at many of your academic centers.”\nThat was cruel!\n“We have no academic centers!”\n“I find your interest in him surprising.”\n“Casual interest, no more.”\nAnd that Futar sprang from an oak tree struck by lightning!\n“We call his Golden Path ‘the paper chase.’ He blew it into the infinite winds and said: ‘See? There is where it goes.’ That’s the Scattering.”\n“Some prefer to call it the Seeking.”\n“Could he really predict our future? Is that what interests you?” Bullseye!\nGreat Honored Matre coughed into her hand.\n“We say Muad’Dib created a future. Leto II un-created it.”\n“But if | could know...”\n“Please! Great Honored Matre! People who demand that the oracle predict their lives really want to know where the treasure is hidden.”\n“But of course!”\n“Know your entire future and nothing will ever surprise you? Is that it?”\n“In SO many words.”\n“You don’t want the future, you want now extended forever.”\n“| could not have said it better.”\n“And you said | bored you!”\n“What?”\nOrange in her eyes. Careful.\n“Never another surprise? What could be more boring?”\n“Ahhhh ... Oh! But that’s not what | mean.”\n“Then I’m afraid | do not understand what you want, Great Honored Matre.”\n“No matter. We'll return to it tomorrow.\nReprieve!\nGreat Honored Matre stood. “Back into your cage.”\n“Eat?” The Futar sounded plaintive.\n“I have some wonderful food for you downstairs, darling. Then l'Il rub your back.”\nLucilla entered her cage. Great Honored Matre threw a chair cushion in after her. “Use that against the shigawire. See how kind | can be?”\nThe cage door sealed with a click.\nThe Futar in its cage slid back into the wall. The panel Snapped closed over it.\n“They get so restless when they’re hungry,” Great Honored Matre said. She opened the door to the room and turned to contemplate Lucilla for a moment. “You will not be disturbed here. | am refusing permission for anyone else to enter this room.”\nMany things we do naturally become difficult only when we try to make them intellectual subjects. It is possible to know so much about a subject that you become totally ignorant.\n—MENTAT TEXT TWO (DICTO)\n[o eriodically, Odrade went for dinner with acolytes and their Proctor-Watchers, the most immediate warders in this mind-prison from which many would never be released.\nWhat the acolytes thought and did really informed the depths of Mother Superior’s consciousness on how well Chapterhouse functioned. Acolytes responded from their moods and forebodings more directly than Reverend Mothers. Full Sisters got very good at not being seen at their worst. They did not try to conceal essentials, but anyone could walk in an orchard or close a door and be out of the view of watchdogs.\nNot so the acolytes.\nThere was little slack time in Central these days. Even the dining halls had their constant streams of occupants no matter the hour. Workshifts were staggered and it was easy for a Reverend Mother to adjust her circadian rhythms to off- beat time. Odrade could not waste energy on such adjustments. At the evening meal, she paused at the door to the Acolyte Hall and heard the sudden hush.\nEven the way they conveyed food to their mouths said something. Where did the eyes go as the chopsticks progressed mouthward? Was it a quick stab and a rapid chew before a convulsive swallow? That was a one to watch. She was brewing upsets. And that thoughtful one over there who looked at each mouthful as though wondering how they\nhid the poison in such slop? A creative mind behind those eyes. Test her for a more sensitive position.\nOdrade entered the hall.\nThe floor had a large checkerboard pattern, black and white plaz, virtually unscratchable. Acolytes said the pattern was for Reverend Mothers to use as a game board: “Place one of us here and another over there and some along that central line. Move them thus—winner take all.”\nOdrade took a seat near the corner of a table beside the western windows. The acolytes made room for her, their movements quietly unobtrusive.\nThis hall was part of the oldest construction on Chapterhouse. Built of wood with clear-span beams overhead, enormously thick and heavy things finished in dull black. They were some twenty-five meters long without a joint. Somewhere on Chapterhouse there was a grove of genetically tailored oaks reaching up to sunlight in their carefully tended plantations. Trees going up thirty meters at least without a limb, and more than two meters through the boles. They had been planted when this hall was built, replacements for these beams when age weakened them. Nineteen hundred SY the beams were supposed to endure.\nHow carefully the acolytes around her watched Mother Superior without ever appearing to look directly at her.\nOdrade turned her head to peer out the western windows at the sunset. Dust again. The spreading intrusion from the desert inflamed the setting sun and set it glowing like a distant ember that might explode into uncontrollable fire at any instant.\nOdrade suppressed a sigh. Thoughts such as these recreated her nightmare: the chasm... the tightrope. She knew if she closed her eyes she would feel herself swaying on the rope. The hunter with the axe was nearer!\nAcolytes eating close by stirred nervously as though they sensed her disquiet. Perhaps they did. Odrade heard the movement of fabrics and this dragged her out of her\nnightmare. She had become sensitized to a new note in the sounds of Central. There was a grating noise behind the most commonplace movements—that chair being shifted behind her... and the opening of that kitchen door. Rasping grit. Cleaning crews complained of sand and “the damnable dust.”\nOdrade stared out the window at the source of that irritation: wind from the south. A dull haze, something between tan and earth brown, drew a curtain across the horizon. After the wind, dustings of its deposits would be found in building corners and on lee sides of hills. There was a flinty aroma to it, something alkaline that irritated the nostrils.\nShe looked down at the table as a serving acolyte placed her meal in front of her.\nOdrade found herself enjoying\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0721e0c0495e602c39b53419138c866939845742a1e9f2681928700f7f0d51d9_v2"}
