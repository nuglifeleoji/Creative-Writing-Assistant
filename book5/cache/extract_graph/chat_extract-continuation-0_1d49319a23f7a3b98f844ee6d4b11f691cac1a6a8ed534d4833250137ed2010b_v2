姑娘到底还是不老练，最后这句话使汪淼明白她瞒着自己许多。“他那话成名言了？”汪淼看看前面开车的大史说。\n   到达别墅时天还没亮，别墅的上层有一个房间亮着灯．其他窗口都黑着。汪淼刚走下车，立刻听到了楼上发出的声音，连着几声，像是什么东西在拍墙。刚下车的大史听到这声音后立刻警觉起来，一脚踹开虚掩着的院门，以与他那壮硕的身躯不相称的敏捷飞速冲进别墅，他的三名同事随后跟进。汪淼和魏成跟着进了别墅，从客厅上了二楼，走进了那间开着门亮着灯的房间，鞋底“啪啪”地踏在了正在向外流淌的血泊中——那天夜里也是这个时候，汪淼就是在这个房间看到申玉菲在玩《三体》——现在，她平躺在房间正中，胸前的两个弹孔还在涌血，第二颗子弹从左眉心穿入，使她的整个脸都糊在血中，在距她不远处，一枝手枪泡在血里。\n   汪淼进来时，正赶上大史和他的一位男同事冲出来，进了对面一间开着门黑着灯的房间，那房间的窗大开着，汪淼听到外面有汽车发动的声音。一名男瞥察开始打电话，徐冰冰远远地站在一边紧张地看着，她大概和汪淼他们一样，也是第一次见到这场面。大史很快回来了，一边把枪插回胸前的套中，一边对那个打电话的同事说：“黑色桑塔纳，只有一个人，车号看不清，让他们重点封锁五环入口，奶奶的，可能要让他溜了。”大史环顾四周，看到了墙上的几个弹洞，又扫了一眼地上散落的弹壳，说，“对方开了五枪，打中三枪；她开了两枪，都没中。”然后蹲下来与男同事一起检验尸体。小徐仍远远站着，偷偷看了站在她旁边的魏成一眼，大史也抬头看了他一眼。\n   魏成脸上有一丝震惊，一丝悲哀，但也仅仅是一丝而已，他那固有的木然仍没有被打破，比起汪淼来，他镇静多了。\n   “你好像无所谓啊，那人可能是来杀你的。”大史对魏成说。\n   魏成居然笑了一下，凄惨的笑。“我能怎么样？到现在，对她我其实是一无所知，我不止一次劝她把生活过得简单些，可……唉，�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
