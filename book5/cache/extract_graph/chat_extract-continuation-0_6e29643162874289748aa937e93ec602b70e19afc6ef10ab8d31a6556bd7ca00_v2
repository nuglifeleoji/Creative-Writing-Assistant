冻，这些湖泊原来封冻的冰面上落满了沙尘，与大地融为一体，现在渐渐变成一个个晶莹闪亮的镜面，仿佛大地睁开了无数只眼睛。在这高处，浸泡的具体细节看不请楚，只能看到湖边的人渐渐多了起来，像春天拥出洞穴的蚁群。世界再一次复活了。\n　　“您不下去投身于这美妙的生活吗？刚刚复活的女性是最渴望爱隋的。”墨子指着下面重现生机的大地对汪淼说，“你在这里再待下去没有意义了，游戏已经终结，我是最后的胜者。”\n　　“你的模拟宇宙作为一台机器确实精妙绝伦，但对它做出的预测嘛……哦，我能否使用您那台望远镜观测天象呢？”\n　　“当然可以，你请。”墨子对着大望远镜做了个手势。\n　　汪淼走到望远镜前，立刻发现了问题：“要观测太阳，怎么办呢？”\n　　墨子从一只木箱中拿出了一块黑色圆片，“加上这片烟熏的滤镜。”说着将它插到望远镜的目镜前。汪淼将望远镜对准已升到半空的太阳，不由赞叹墨子的想象力：太阳看上去确实像一个通向无边火海的孔洞，是一个更大存在的一小部分。但进一步细看时，他发现，这个太阳与自己现实经验中的那个有些不同，它有一颗很小的核心，如果将太阳看成一只眸子，这个日核就像瞳孔。日核虽小，但明亮而致密，包裹它的外层则显得有些缺少实在感，飘忽不定，很像是气态的。而穿过那厚厚的外层能看到内部日核，也说明外层是处于透明或半透明状态的，它发出的光芒，更多的可能是日核光芒的散射。\n　　太阳图像的真实和精致令汪淼震惊，他再次确定，游戏的作者在表面简洁的图像深处有意隐藏了海量的细节，等待着玩家去发掘。\n　　汪淼直起身，细想着这个太阳的结构隐含的意义，立刻兴奋起来。由于游戏时间加速，太阳已移到了西天，汪淼调整望远镜再次对准它，一直跟踪到它落下地平线。夜幕降临。大地上点点排火与夜空渐密的群星相映。汪淼将望远镜上的黑色滤镜取下，继续观测星空，他最感兴趣的是飞星，很快找到了两个。他只来得及对其中的一个进行大概的观察，天就又亮了。他于是装上滤镜接着观测太阳……汪淼就这样连续进行了十多天的天文观测，享受着发现的乐趣。其实，时间流逝速度的加快是有利于天文观测的。因为这使得天体的运行和变化更加明显。\n　　恒纪元开始后的第十七天，日出时问已过了五个小时，大地仍笼罩在夜幕中。金字塔下面人山人海。无数火把在寒风中摇曳。\n　　“太阳可能不会出来了，同137号文明的结局一样。”汪\n######################\nOutput:",
