\n　　晓霞一听是少平的哥哥，很快热情地招呼他坐在自己的床上，接着就给他冲好了一杯加糖的茶水。宿舍里其他同学见来了客人，便先后礼貌地离开了。 \n　　“你知道少平做活的地方离这儿远不远？”少安拘谨地抿了一口茶水，问。 \n　　“远着哩！在南关外的柴油机厂，少说也有五里路。”晓霞对他说。 \n　　使少安高兴的是，晓霞真的知道少平在什么地方。他现在心里才真正踏实了。“我这就起身寻他去呀。”少安性急地站起来。 \n　　“那怎么行呢？这么远的路，你得走老半天！”“五里路算个啥，我一会就走到了。” \n　　“你会不会骑自行车？”晓霞问。 \n　　“会哩。” \n　　“那好！我有自行车，咱们骑车子去找他。你能带人吗？”“就怕城里我带不了……” \n　　晓霞笑了，说：“现在街上没多少人。万一你带不了，我带你！” \n　　“那怎能哩！我试着带你！” \n　　少安没想到，地委书记的女儿对人这么热情。 \n　　晓霞很快在肩头挎起了自己的黄帆布书包，推起自行车和他一同相跟着出了门。 \n　　孙少安本来骑自行车还可以，但这是在黄原城里，又带着地委书记的女儿，心里不免有些紧张。他两条胳膊僵硬地握着车把，小心翼翼地按晓霞的指点往南关骑去。 \n　　到柴油机厂的大门口时，他浑身的内衣都被汗水湿透了——这多半是由于紧张而造成的。 \n　　进了柴油机厂乱七八糟的大院。晓霞也难住了。上次顾养民请少平吃饭，她曾来这里找过少平一回；但她是在工地的脚手架上找到他的。现在已经收工，谁知他住在什么地方呢？ \n　　少安马上对她说：“你先在这儿等一等，我去查问一下！” \n　　孙少安好不容易才找到揽工人住的一孔破窑洞。这些人告诉他，少平一个人住在正盖着的第二层楼房里。少安旋即返回来，对晓霞说：“他在前面的楼上住……你回去吧，实在麻烦你了！” \n　　“我跟你一块去找他！我正想看看他住在什么地方哩！”晓霞说着便把车子推在一边，锁了起来。 \n　　少安只好和她一块到那座楼里去找少平。 \n　　从外面矗起的脚手架看，这是一座五层楼，现在正盖第四层。 \n　　少安和晓霞绊绊磕磕从一堆一摞的建筑材料中穿过，进了那座楼的门洞。 \n　　整个楼内象炸弹炸过一般零乱。到处是固定和拆卸下的木模和钢模。楼道的水泥还没有干，勉强能下脚。里面没有电灯，两个\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
