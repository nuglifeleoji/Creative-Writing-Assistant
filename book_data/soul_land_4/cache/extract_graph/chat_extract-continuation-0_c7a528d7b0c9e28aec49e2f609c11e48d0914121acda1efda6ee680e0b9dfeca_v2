人怎么也骂不过上亿个孩子。恶梦时期开始以后，他们俩几乎每天都在电视上出现，每天向全国的孩子们问侯一句：\n　　“喂，小朋友，你们怎么样了？”（小梦）或者：“喂，小猪们，怎么样了？”（华华）\n　　回答都一样：\n　　“活着呢，真讨厌！”\n　　话是这么说，但孩子们并不讨厌华华和小梦，如果他们哪天没出现，大家都觉得心神不定，互相问：今儿个电视上怎么没见那俩好孩子？“好孩子”这个称呼带着讽剌也带着善意，反正以后大家就这么称呼他们了。而华华和小梦每天听到一声“活着”，似乎心也多少放下了些，只要这声“活着”在，最可怕的事情就还没有在国土上发生。\n　　两个孩子不停地要求FG为眼前的困境想想办法，但超级电脑的回答每次都一样：国家正在按全体公民的意愿运行，它运行得很好，再没有比现在这么好的了。\n　　终于有一天早晨，华华和小梦在电视和广播中向全国孩子问候时，回答不再是令他们放心的“活着”了。\n　　“有点饿。”孩子们说。\n　　这样的回答只持续了三天，很快变成了：\n　　“我们饿！”\n　　最可怕的事情发生了，粮食，这维持人类社会生存的最基本物质，开始出现危机。\n　　粮食危机到来之快令信息大厦中的孩子们在惊恐之余有些不能理解，因为据FG提供的数字，大人们留下的粮食在数量上至少够三亿孩子吃一年的。危机提前到来的原因是多方面的，首先是因为国家的无组织状态，在粮食贮量大的地区孩子并不多，而在在孩子密集的城市粮食很快告急。这时尽管国土上仍有大量的存粮，但剩下的粮库离城市均有一定的距离。在铁路线上，堆满了被感应电流破坏的列车，沿路的信号装置和车站的各种设施也大部分被破坏，孩子们现在还不敢走近带电的铁轨，铁路运输在短时间内无法恢复。公路倒是完好无损，只是被大人们遗留的汽车堵得死了。其它国家的铁路和空中运输也大多处于瘫痪状态，但公路运输在这之前早已恢复。这件事即使对十岁左右的孩子来说也并不是太难，因为公路上阻塞的那些汽车大多是可以开动的，只需要良好的组织就可把路疏通，而中国孩子现在最缺的就是组织。城市的粮食危机发生后，有不少孩子曾做过疏通公路的努力，但这种努力是零散和无组织的，往往是前面清到路边的车又被后面的孩子开了上去，并由于驾驶技术不精重新把路堵死。所以到现在，除了少数中小城市外，绝大多数城市都被切断了动脉。\n　　同时，清明时节气候潮湿，孩子们从粮库中随意取粮时破坏了库中的各种设施，加上无人管理，造成粮食大量霉烂变质，\n######################\nOutput:",
