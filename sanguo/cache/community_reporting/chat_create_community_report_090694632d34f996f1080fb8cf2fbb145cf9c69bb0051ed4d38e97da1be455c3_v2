This term encompasses the various tribes that were considered difficult to conquer and were frequently in conflict with the Shu Han forces. The southern tribes, known collectively as 南蛮, posed significant challenges to the central powers of the time, particularly the Shu Han, which was one of the three rival states during this tumultuous era.\n\nThe historical context of 南蛮 is marked by its interactions with the Shu Han, where these tribes were often engaged in hostilities. The Shu Han, under its leadership, sought to expand its influence and territory, leading to confrontations with the 南蛮 tribes. Notably, during this period, the warlord Cao Pi devised a strategy to attack the Shu Han by forming an alliance with the蛮王孟获, the king of the southern tribes. This plan highlights the strategic importance of the 南蛮 territories in the broader conflicts of the Three Kingdoms, as they were seen as both a threat and a potential ally in the power struggles of the time.\n\nIn summary, 南蛮 represents a significant aspect of the southern regions of ancient China, characterized by its fierce tribes and their complex relationships with the Shu Han forces. The term encapsulates the challenges faced by the Shu Han in their attempts to assert control over these territories, as well as the strategic maneuvers employed by rival factions to leverage the influence of the southern tribes in their favor.\",7\n2700,三江界路,三江界路 is a geographical location where significant battles occur between the forces of Shu Han and the southern barbarians.,1\n2702,猛兽,\"猛兽 refers to the wild beasts unleashed by the southern barbarians during their attacks, creating chaos on the battlefield.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4800,蛮王孟获,南蛮,蛮王孟获是南蛮的统治者，负责管理和指挥南蛮的军事行动,9\n4961,南蛮,三江界路,三江界路 is a battleground where the forces of Shu Han confront the 南蛮,8\n4962,南蛮,猛兽,猛兽 are used by the 南蛮 as part of their battle tactics against the forces of Shu Han,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
