�？如国家无孤一人，正不知几人称帝，几人称王。或见孤权重，妄相忖度，疑孤有异心，此大谬也。孤常念孔子称文王之至德，此言耿耿在心。但欲孤委捐兵众，归就所封武平侯之国，实不可耳：诚恐一解兵柄，为人所害；孤败则国家倾危；是以不得慕虚名而处实祸也。诸公必无知孤意者。”众皆起拜曰：“虽伊尹、周公，不及丞相矣。”后人有诗曰：“周公恐惧流言日，王莽谦恭下士时：假使当年身便死，一生真伪有谁知！”\n\n    曹操连饮数杯，不觉沉醉，唤左右捧过笔砚，亦欲作《铜雀台诗》。刚才下笔，忽报：“东吴使华歆表奏刘备为荆州牧，孙权以妹嫁刘备，汉上九郡大半已属备矣。“操闻之，手脚慌乱，投笔于地。程昱曰：“丞相在万军之中，矢石交攻之际，未尝动心；今闻刘备得了荆州，何故如此失惊？”操曰：“刘备，人中之龙也，生平未尝得水。今得荆州，是困龙入大海矣。孤安得不动心哉！”程昱曰：“丞相知华歆来意否？”操曰：“未知。”昱曰：“孙权本忌刘备，欲以兵攻之；但恐丞相乘虚而击，故令华歆为使，表荐刘备，乃安备之心，以塞丞相之望耳。”操点头曰：“是也。”昱曰：“某有一计，使孙、刘自相吞并，丞相乘间图之，一鼓而二敌俱破。”操大喜，遂问其计。程昱曰：“东吴所倚者，周瑜也。丞相今表奏周瑜为南郡太守，程普为江夏太守，留华歆在朝重用之；瑜必自与刘备为仇敌矣。我乘其相并而图之，不亦善乎？”操曰：“仲德之言，正合孤意。”遂召华歆上台，重加赏赐。当日筵散，操即引文武回许昌，表奏周瑜为总领南郡太守、程普为江夏太守。封华歆为大理少卿，留在许都。\n\n    使命至东吴，周瑜、程普各受职讫。周瑜既领南郡，愈思报仇，遂上书吴侯，乞令鲁肃去讨还荆州。孙权乃命肃曰：“汝昔保借荆州与刘备，今备迁延不还，等待何时？”肃曰：“文书上明白写着，得了西川便还。”权叱曰：“只说取西川，到今又不动兵，不等老了人！”肃曰：“某愿往言之。”遂乘船投荆州而来。却说玄德与孔明在荆州广聚粮草，调练军马，远近之士多归之。忽报鲁肃到。玄德问孔明曰：“子敬此来何意？”孔明曰：“昨者孙权表主公为荆州牧，此是惧曹操之计。操封周瑜为南郡太守，此欲令我两家自相吞并，他好于中取事也。今鲁\n######################\nOutput:",
