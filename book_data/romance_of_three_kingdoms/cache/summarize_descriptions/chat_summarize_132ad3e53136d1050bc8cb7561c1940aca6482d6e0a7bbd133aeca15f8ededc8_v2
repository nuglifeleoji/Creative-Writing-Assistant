Cao Hong serves as a trusted general under Cao Cao, actively participating in military operations and strategies against notable adversaries such as Liu Bei, Yuan Shao, and Ma Chao.

His contributions are recognized by Cao Cao, who relies on him for strategic military decisions and operations. This mentor-mentee dynamic is further illustrated by Cao Cao's expressions of disappointment when Cao Hong fails to defend Tong Guan, indicating the high expectations Cao Cao has for his subordinate.\n\nThroughout their military endeavors, Cao Hong demonstrates unwavering loyalty and commitment to Cao Cao's cause. He responds to calls for assistance, particularly in efforts to protect the Emperor, showcasing his dedication to both his leader and the broader political stability of the realm. His involvement in various campaigns not only solidifies his reputation as a capable general but also reinforces the strong military partnership between him and Cao Cao.\n\nIn summary, Cao Hong is a key figure in Cao Cao's military strategies, contributing significantly to the efforts against rival factions and demonstrating a deep sense of loyalty and responsibility in his role as a general.
