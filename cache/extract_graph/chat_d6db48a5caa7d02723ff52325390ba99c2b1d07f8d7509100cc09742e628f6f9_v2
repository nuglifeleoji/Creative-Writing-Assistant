One burst of a lasgun into that field and the entire citadel would be a hole in the ground.\nHer guard stopped ten paces from the foot of the dais, parted to open an unobstructed view of the Emperor. She noted now the absence of Chani and Irulan, wondered at it. He held no important audience without them, so it was said.\nPaul nodded to her, silent, measuring.\nImmediately, she decided to take the offensive, said: “So, the great Paul Atreides deigns to see the one he banished.”\nPaul smiled wryly, thinking: She knows | want something from her. That knowledge had been inevitable, she being who she was. He recognized her powers. The Bene Gesserit didn’t become Reverend Mothers by chance.\n“Shall we dispense with fencing?” he asked.\nWould it be this easy? she wondered. And she said: “Name the thing you want.”\nStilgar stirred, cast a sharp glance at Paul. The Imperial lackey didn’t like her tone.\n“Stilgar wants me to send you away,” Paul said.\n“Not kill me?” she asked. “I would’ve expected something more direct from a Fremen Naib.”\nStilgar scowled, said: “Often, | must speak otherwise than | think. That is called diplomacy.”\n“Then let us dispense with diplomacy as well,” she said. “Was it necessary to have me walk all that distance? | am an old woman.”\n“You had to be shown how callous | can be,” Paul said. “That way, you'll appreciate magnanimity.”\n“You dare such gaucheries with a Bene Gesserit?” she asked.\n“Gross actions carry their own messages,” Paul said.\nShe hesitated, weighed his words. So—he might yet dispense with her... grossly, obviously, if she... if she what?\n“Say what it is you want from me,” she muttered.\nAlia glanced at her brother, nodded toward the draperies behind the throne. She knew Paul’s reasoning in this, but disliked it all the same. Call it wild prophecy: She felt pregnant with reluctance to take part in this bargaining.\n“You must be careful how you speak to me, old woman,” Paul said.\nHe called me old woman when he was a Stripling, the Reverend Mother thought. Does he remind me now of my hand in his past? The decision | made then, must I remake it here? She felt the weight of decision, a physical thing that set her knees to trembling. Muscles cried their fatigue.\n“It was a long walk,” Paul said, “and | can see that you’re tired. We will retire to my private chamber behind the throne. You may sit there.” He gave a hand-signal to Stilgar, arose.\nStilgar and the ghola converged on her, helped her up the steps, followed Paul through a passage concealed by the draperies. She realized then why he had greeted her in the hall: a dumb-show for the guards and Naibs. He feared them, then. And now—now, he displayed kindly benevolence, daring such wiles on a Bene Gesserit. Or was it daring? She sensed another presence behind, glanced back to see Alia following. The younger woman’s eyes held a brooding, baleful cast. The Reverend Mother shuddered.\nThe private chamber at the end of the passage was a twenty-meter cube of plasmeld, yellow glowglobes for light, the deep orange hangings of a desert stilltent around the walls. It contained divans, soft cushions, a faint odor of melange, crystal water flagons on a low table. It felt cramped, tiny after the outer hall.\nPaul seated her on a divan, stood over her, studying the ancient face—steely teeth, eyes that hid more than they\nrevealed, deeply wrinkled skin. He indicated a water flagon. She shook her head, dislodging a wisp of gray hair.\nIn a low voice, Paul said: “I wish to bargain with you for the life of my beloved.”\nStilgar cleared his throat.\nAlia fingered the handle of the crysknife sheathed at her neck.\nThe ghola remained at the door, face impassive, metal eyes pointed at the air above the Reverend Mother’s head.\n“Have you had a vision of my hand in her death?” the Reverend Mother asked. She kept her attention on the ghola, oddly disturbed by him. Why should she feel threatened by the ghola? He was a tool of the conspiracy.\n“I know what it is you want from me,” Paul said, avoiding her question.\nThen he only suspects, she thought. The Reverend Mother looked down at the tips of her shoes exposed by a fold of her robe. Black... black... shoes and robe showed marks of her confinement: stains, wrinkles. She lifted her chin, met an angry glare in Paul’s eyes. Elation surged through her, but she hid the emotion behind pursed lips, slitted eyelids.\n“What coin do you offer?” she asked.\n“You may have my seed, but not my person,” Paul said. “Irulan banished and inseminated by artificial—”\n“You dare!” the Reverend Mother flared, stiffening.\nStilgar took a half step forward.\nDisconcertingly, the ghola smiled. And now Alia was studying him.\n“We'll not discuss the things your Sisterhood forbids,” Paul said. “I will listen to no talk of sins, abominations or the beliefs left over from past Jihads. You may have my seed for your plans, but no child of Irulan’s will sit on my throne.”\n“Your throne,” she sneered.\n“My throne.”\n“Then who will bear the Imperial heir?”\n“Chani.”\n“She is barren.”\n“She is with child.”\nAn involuntary indrawn breath exposed her shock. “You lie!” she snapped.\nPaul held up a restraining hand as Stilgar surged forward.\n“We've known for two days that she carries my child.”\n“But Irulan.. .”\n“By artificial means only. That’s my offer.”\nThe Reverend Mother closed her eyes to hide his face. Damnation! To cast the genetic dice in such a way! Loathing boiled in her breast. The teaching of the Bene Gesserit, the lessons of the Butlerian Jinad—all proscribed such an act. One did not demean the highest aspirations of humankind. No machine could function in the way of a human mind. No word or deed could imply that men might be bred on the level of animals.\n“Your decision,” Paul said.\nShe shook her head. The genes, the precious Atreides genes—only these were important. Need went deeper than proscription. For the Sisterhood, mating mingled more than sperm and ovum. One aimed to capture the psyche.\nThe Reverend Mother understood now the subtle depths of Paul’s offer. He would make the Bene Gesserit party to an act which would bring down popular wrath... were it ever discovered. They could not admit such paternity if the Emperor denied it. This coin might save the Atreides genes for the Sisterhood, but it would never buy a throne.\nShe swept her gaze around the room, studying each face: Stilgar, passive and waiting now; the ghola frozen at some inward place; Alia watching the ghola ... and Paul—wrath beneath a shallow veneer.\n“This is your only offer?” she asked.\n“My only offer.”\nShe glanced at the ghola, caught by a brief movement of muscles across his cheeks. Emotion? “You, ghola,” she said.\n“Should such an offer be made? Having been made, should it be accepted? Function as the mentat for us.”\nThe metallic eyes turned to Paul.\n“Answer as you will,” Paul said.\nThe ghola returned his gleaming attention to the Reverend Mother, shocked her once more by smiling. “An offer is only as good as the real thing it buys,” he said. “The exchange offered here is life-for-life, a high order of business.”\nAlia brushed a strand of coppery hair from her forehead, said: “And what else is hidden in this bargain?”\nThe Reverend Mother refused to look at Alia, but the words burned in her mind. Yes, far deeper implications lay here. The sister was an abomination, true, but there could be no denying her status as a Reverend Mother with all the title implied. Gaius Helen Mohiam felt herself in this instant to be not one single person, but all the others who sat like tiny congeries in her memory. They were alert, every Reverend Mother she had absorbed in becoming a Priestess of the Sisterhood. Alia would be standing in the same situation here.\n“What else?” the ghola asked. “One wonders why the witches of the Bene Gesserit have not used Tleilaxu methods.”\nGaius Helen Mohiam and all the Reverend Mothers within her shuddered. Yes, the Tleilaxu did loathsome things. If one let down the barriers to artificial insemination, was the next step a Tleilaxu one—controlled mutation?\nPaul, observing the play of emotion around him, felt abruptly that he no longer knew these people. He could see only strangers. Even Alia was a stranger.\nAlia said: “If we set the Atreides genes adrift in a Bene Gesserit river, who knows what may result?”\nGaius Helen Mohiam’s head snapped around, and she met Alia’s gaze. For a flashing instant, they were two Reverend Mothers together, communing on a single\nthought: What lay behind any Tleilaxu action? The ghola was a Tleilaxu thing. Had he put this plan into Paul’s mind? Would Paul attempt to bargain directly with the Bene Tleilax?\nShe broke her gaze from Alia’s, feeling her own ambivalence and inadequacies. The pitfall of Bene Gesserit training, she reminded herself, lay in the powers granted: such powers predisposed one to vanity and pride. But power deluded those who used it. One tended to believe power could overcome any barrier... including one’s own ignorance.\nOnly one thing stood paramount here for the Bene Gesserit, she told herself. That was the pyramid of generations which had reached an apex in Paul Atreides... and in his abomination of a sister. A wrong choice here and the pyramid would have to be rebuilt . . . starting generations back in the parallel lines and with breeding specimens lacking the choicest characteristics.\nControlled mutation, she thought. Did the Tleilaxu really practice it? How tempting! She shook her head, the better to rid it of such thoughts.\n“You reject my proposal?” Paul asked.\n“I’m thinking,” she said.\nAnd again, she looked at the sister. The optimum cross for this female Atreides had been lost... killed by Paul. Another possibility remained, however—one which would cement the desired characteristic into an offspring. Paul dared offer animal breeding to the Bene Gesserit! How much was he really prepared to pay for his Chani’s life? Would he accept a cross with his own sister?\nSparring for time, the Reverend Mother said: “Tell me, oh flawless exemplar of all that’s holy, has Irulan anything to say of your proposal?”\n“Irulan will do what you tell her to do,” Paul growled.\nTrue enough, Mohiam thought. She firmed her jaw, offered a new gambit: “There are two Atreides.”\nPaul, sensing something of what lay in the old witch’s mind, felt blood darken his face. “Careful what you suggest,” he said.\n“You'd just use Irulan to gain your own ends, eh?” she asked.\n“Wasn't she trained to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d6db48a5caa7d02723ff52325390ba99c2b1d07f8d7509100cc09742e628f6f9_v2"}
