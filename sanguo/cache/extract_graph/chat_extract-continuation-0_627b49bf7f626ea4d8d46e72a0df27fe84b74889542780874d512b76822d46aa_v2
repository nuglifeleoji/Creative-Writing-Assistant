长回马，大叫一声，舞刀直取。王忠拦截不住，恰待骤马奔逃，云长左手倒提宝刀，右手揪住王忠勒甲绦，拖下鞍鞒，横担于马上，回本阵来。王忠军四散奔走。\n\n    云长押解王忠，回徐州见玄德。玄德问：“尔乃何人？现居何职？敢诈称曹丞相！”忠曰：“焉敢有诈。奉命教我虚张声势，以为疑兵。丞相实不在此。”玄德教付衣服酒食，且暂监下，待捉了刘岱，再作商议。云长曰：“某知兄有和解之意，故生擒将来。”玄德曰：“吾恐翼德躁暴，杀了王忠，故不教去。此等人杀之无益，留之可为解和之地。”张飞曰：“二哥捉了王忠，我去生擒刘岱来！”玄德曰：“刘岱昔为兖州刺史，虎牢关伐董卓时，也是一镇诸侯，今日为前军，不可轻敌。”飞曰：“量此辈何足道哉！我也似二哥生擒将来便了。”玄德曰：“只恐坏了他性命，误我大事。”飞曰：“如杀了，我偿他命！”玄德遂与军三千。飞引兵前进。\n\n

却说刘岱知王忠被擒，坚守不出。张飞每日在寨前叫骂，岱听知是张飞，越不敢出。飞守了数日，见岱不出，心生一计：传令今夜二更去劫寨；日间却在帐中饮酒诈醉，寻军士罪过，打了一顿，缚在营中，曰：“待我今夜出兵时，将来祭旗！”却暗使左右纵之去。军士得脱，偷走出营，径往刘岱营中来报劫寨之事。刘岱见降卒身受重伤，遂听其说，虚扎空寨，伏兵在外。是夜张飞却分兵三路，中间使三十余人，劫寨放火；却教两路军抄出他寨后，看火起为号，夹击之。三更时分，张飞自引精兵，先断刘岱后路；中路三十余人，抢入寨中放火。刘岱伏兵恰待杀入，张飞两路兵齐出。岱军自乱，正不知飞兵多少，各自溃散。刘岱引一队残军，夺路而走，正撞见张飞，狭路相逢，急难回避，交马只一合，早被张飞生擒过去。余众皆降。飞使人先报入徐州。玄德闻之，谓云长曰：“翼德自来粗莽，今亦用智，吾无忧矣！”乃亲自出郭迎之。飞曰：“哥哥道我躁暴，今日如何？玄德曰：“不用言语相激，如何肯使机谋！”飞大笑。\n\n
