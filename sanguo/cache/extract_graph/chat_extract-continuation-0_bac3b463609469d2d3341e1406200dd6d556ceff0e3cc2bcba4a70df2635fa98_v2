貂蝉舞于帘外。有词赞之曰：“原是昭阳宫里人，惊鸿宛转掌中身，只疑飞过洞庭春。按彻《梁州》莲步稳，好花风袅一枝新，画堂香暖不胜春。”又诗曰：“红牙催拍燕飞忙，一片行云到画堂。眉黛促成游子恨，脸容初断故人肠。榆钱不买千金笑，柳带何须百宝妆。舞罢隔帘偷目送，不知谁是楚襄王。”舞罢，卓命近前。貂蝉转入帘内，深深再拜。卓见貂蝉颜色美丽，便问：“此女何人？”允曰：“歌伎貂蝉也。”卓曰：“能唱否？”允命貂蝉执檀板低讴一曲。正是：“一点樱桃启绛唇，两行碎玉喷阳春。丁香舌吐衠钢剑，要斩奸邪乱国臣。”卓称赏不已。允命貂蝉把盏。卓擎杯问曰：“青春几何？”貂蝉曰：“贱妾年方二八。”卓笑曰：“真神仙中人也！”允起曰：“允欲将此女献上太师，未审肯容纳否？”卓曰：“如此见惠，何以报德？”允曰：“此女得侍太师，其福不浅。”卓再三称谢。允即命备毡车，先将貂蝉送到相府。卓亦起身告辞。允亲送董卓直到相府，然后辞回。\n\n    乘马而行，不到半路，只见两行红灯照道，吕布骑马执戟而来，正与王允撞见，便勒住马，一把揪住衣襟，厉声问曰：“司徒既以貂蝉许我，今又送与太师，何相戏耶？”允急止之曰：“此非说话处，且请到草舍去。”布同允到家，下马入后堂。叙礼毕，允曰：“将军何故怪老夫？”布曰：“有人报我，说你把毡车送貂蝉入相府，是何意故？”允曰：“将军原来不知！昨日太师在朝堂中，对老夫说：‘我有一事，明日要到你家。’允因此准备小宴等候。太师饮酒中间，说：‘我闻你有一女，名唤貂蝉，已许吾儿奉先。我恐你言未准，特来相求，并请一见。’老夫不敢有违，随引貂蝉出拜公公。太师曰：‘今日良辰，吾即当取此女回去，配与奉先。’将军试思：太师亲临，老夫焉敢推阻？”布曰：“司徒少罪。布一时错见，来日自当负荆。”允曰：“小女颇有妆奁，待过将军府下，便当送至。”布谢去。次日，吕布在府中打听，绝不闻音耗。径入堂中，寻问诸侍妾。侍妾对曰：“夜来太师与新人共寝，至今未起。”布大怒，潜入卓卧房后窥探。时貂蝉起于窗下梳头，忽见窗外池中照一人影，极长大，头戴束发冠；偷眼视之，正是吕布。貂\n######################\nOutput:",
