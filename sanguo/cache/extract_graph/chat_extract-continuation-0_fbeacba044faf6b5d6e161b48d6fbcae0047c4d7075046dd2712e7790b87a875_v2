主将答话。耀纵马而出，遥见孔明，心中暗喜，回顾左右曰：“如蜀兵掩至，便退后走。若见山后火起，却回身杀去，自有兵来相应。”分付毕，跃马出呼曰：“前者败将，今何敢又来！”孔明曰：“唤汝曹真来答话！”耀骂曰：“曹都督乃金枝玉叶，安肯与反贼相见耶！”孔明大怒，把羽扇一招，左有马岱，右有张嶷，两路兵冲出。魏兵便退。行不到三十里，望见蜀兵背后火起，喊声不绝。费耀只道号火，便回身杀来。蜀兵齐退。耀提刀在前，只望喊处追赶。将次近火，山路中鼓角喧天、喊声震地，两军杀出：左有关兴，右有张苞。山上矢石如雨，往下射来。魏兵大败。费耀知是中计，急退军望山谷中而走，人马困乏。背后关兴引生力军赶来，魏兵自相践踏及落涧身死者，不知其数。\n\n    耀逃命而走，正遇山坡口一彪军，乃是姜维。耀大骂曰：“反贼无信！吾不幸误中汝奸计也！”维笑曰：“吾欲擒曹真，误赚汝矣！速下马受降！”耀骤马夺路，望山谷中而走。忽见谷口火光冲天，背后追兵又至。耀自刎身死，余众尽降。孔明连夜驱兵，直出祁山前下寨，收住军马，重赏姜维。维曰：“某恨不得杀曹真也！”孔明亦曰：“可惜大计小用矣。”\n\n    却说曹真听知折了费耀，悔之不及，遂与郭淮商议退兵之策。于是孙礼、辛毗星夜具表申奏魏主，言蜀兵又出祁山，曹真损兵折将，势甚危急。睿大惊，即召司马懿入内曰：“曹真损兵折将，蜀兵又出祁山。卿有何策，可以退之？”懿曰：“臣已有退诸葛亮之计。不用魏军扬武耀威，蜀兵自然走矣。”正是：已见子丹无胜术，全凭仲达有良谋。未知其计如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第九十八回　追汉军王双受诛　袭陈仓武侯取胜\n\n
