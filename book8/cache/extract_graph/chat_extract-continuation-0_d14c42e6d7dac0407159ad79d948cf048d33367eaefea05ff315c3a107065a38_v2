刘锋也是愣了一下，但他的攻势却没有停止，上挑落空，手中白龙枪刺出，在空中化为一片枪芒，将金纹蓝银草对自身的增幅全部倾泻而出。就算不能一击制胜，也要压制对手。\n\n    对面三人此时身形已经清晰的显现了出来。\n\n    这一组的整体实力，甚至还要在金翔那一组之上。\n\n    为首站在中央的，是一名身材高大的少年，梁铮，高能少年班副班长。论个人战斗力甚至是仅次于吕千寻。魂力已经达到了十九级，是全班之中最有可能第二个达到二十级的魂师。\n\n    在他左侧是王力健，右侧则是陈悦霖。\n\n    面对挥洒而来的枪芒，梁铮大喝一声，双手架起，顿时，两片半圆形的金属合二为一，化为一面盾牌。\n\n    而王力健和陈悦霖则是迅速后退，撤后到了梁铮身后。\n\n    “叮叮叮叮叮叮叮……”一连串的脆鸣声中，梁铮连续后退了四步，才将白龙枪的冲击力完全化解。但也总算是挡住了刘锋这最凶猛的一轮攻势。\n\n    如果没有先前看过的录像，他们想要扛住刘锋最初的主动同样很难，毕竟太突然了。可有了录像作为基础，三人简单的商量了一下，就有了眼前的对策。\n\n    梁铮双手手臂上各自有一面半圆形的利刃，他这武魂就叫做半月刃，是一种变异武魂。半月刃合在一起的时候，能化为一面圆盾，分开在双手之上，则是强大的攻击武器。可谓攻防一体。\n\n    梁铮性格沉稳，平时在班里不言不语的，但修炼却特别刻苦，他的目标只有一个，那就是超越吕千寻。\n\n    他的两名队友也和他性格类似，平时在班里不显山露水的，但谁也不敢小看他们。\n\n    此时，梁铮挡住了攻势，蓝轩宇也从后面跟了上来，身在空中，一推刘锋，刘锋已经向侧面落下。同时也再次得到了金纹蓝银草的增幅。\n\n    陈悦霖双手抬起，一根根青碧色的藤蔓席卷而出，延着地面向外四散分开，藤蔓飞速延伸，分别追向蓝轩宇和刘锋。\n\n    他是控制系魂师，武魂常青藤。\n\n    与此同时，在陈悦霖身边，王力健左手一引，一张白色长弓已经出现在他掌握之中，弯弓搭箭，第一魂环闪耀，一根黄色箭矢已经出现在弓弦之上，弓如满月。\n\n    “砰！”的一声弓鸣，箭矢已是暴射而出，那箭矢是向空中射出的，却瞬间绕出一道弧线，直奔远处的钱磊而去。\n\n    攻敌所必救！\n\n    不好！\n\n    蓝轩宇心中暗叫一声。\n\n    这场战斗，钱磊出局\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIU FENG<|>PERSON<|>Liu Feng is a character engaged in a battle, demonstrating offensive
