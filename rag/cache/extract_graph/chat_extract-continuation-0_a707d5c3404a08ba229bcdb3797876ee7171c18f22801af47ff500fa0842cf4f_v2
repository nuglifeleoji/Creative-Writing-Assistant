And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n“At what time will you be expecting dinner?” she asked.\nThat’s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place—alone, the two of us, without a care.\n“I'll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late. And...ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. | want him to attend our strategy conference.”\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out,\nheaded for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately.”\nThe outer door slammed.\nJessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto’s father. It had been done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke’s middle years. He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto’s now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting.\n“Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!” she whispered.\n“What are your orders, Noble Born?”\nIt was a woman’s voice, thin and stringy.\nJessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray- haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course—that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white—secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.\nThe woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: “I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born. What are your\norders?”\n“You may refer to me as ‘my Lady,’” Jessica said. “I’m not noble born. I’m the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.”\nAgain that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning. “There’s a wife, then?”\n“There is not, nor has there ever been. | am the Duke’s only...companion, the mother of his heir- designate.”\nEven as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words. What was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Yes—/I am meeting more resistance lately. | could use a quiet retreat by myself.\nA weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: “Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo- Sook!” Then: “Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!” And again: “Soo-soo-Sook!”\n“What is that?” Jessica asked. “I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning.”\n“Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you’ve no need to interest yourself in such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it’s always kept full.” She glanced down at her dress. “Why, you know, my Lady, | don’t even have to wear my stillSuit here?” She cackled. “And me not even dead!”\nJessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more imperative.\nr\nStill, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.\n“My husband told me of your title, Shadout,” Jessica said. “I recognized the word. It’s a very ancient word.”\n“You know the ancient tongues then?” Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity.\n“Tongues are the Bene Gesserit’s first learning,” Jessica said. “I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.”\nMapes nodded. “Just as the legend says.”\nAnd Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.\n“I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,” Jessica said. She read the more obvious Signs in Mapes’ actions and appearance, the petit betrayals. “Miseces prejia,” she said in the Chakobsa tongue. “Andral t’re pera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri—”\nMapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.\n“I know many things,” Jessica said. “I know that you have borne children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. | know many things.”\nIn a low voice, Mapes said: “I meant no offense, my Lady.”\n“You speak of the legend and seek answers,” Jessica said. “Beware the answers you may find. |\nknow you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.”\n“My Lady, I....”\n“There’s a remote possibility you could draw my life’s blood,” Jessica said, “but in so doing you'd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know—even for an entire people.”\n“My Lady!” Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. “The weapon was Sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.”\n“And as the means of my death should | prove otherwise,” Jessica said. She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so terrifying in combat.\nNow we see which way the decision tips, she thought.\nSlowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk- white blade, held it up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was double-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long.\n“Do you know this, my Lady?” Mapes asked.\nIt could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor and wild gossip.\n“It’s a crysknife,” she said.\n“Say it not lightly,” Mapes said. “Do you know its meaning?”\nAnd Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here’s the reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could precipitate violence or...what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of a Knife. She’s called the Shadout in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that’s “Death Maker” in Chakobsa. She’s getting restive. | must answer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer.\nJessica said: “It’s a maker—”\n“Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!” Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room.\nJessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch.\nThe key word was...Maker.\nMaker? Maker.\nStill, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.\nJessica said: “Did you think that I, Knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the Maker?”\nMapes lowered the knife. “My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.”\nJessica thought about the prophecy—the Shari-a and all the panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long centuries ago—long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserit’s need.\nWell, that day had come.\nMapes returned knife to sheath, said: “This is an unfixed blade, my Lady. Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate. It’s yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live.”\nJessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: “Mapes, you’ve sheathed that blade unblooded.”\nWith a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica’s hand, tore open the brown bodice, wailing: “Take the water of my life!”\nJessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman. Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew a delicate scratch with the blade’s edge above Mapes’ left breast. There was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thought. A moisture- conserving mutation?\nShe sheathed the blade, said: “Button your dress, Mapes.”\nMapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites Stared at Jessica. “You are ours,” she muttered. “You\nare the One.”\nThere came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica’s bodice. “Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!” she snarled. “You know that, my Lady!”\n| know it now, Jessica thought.\nThe cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.\nMapes composed herself, said: “The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You’ve been entrusted with a crysknife.” She took a deep breath. “Now the thing must take its course. It cannot be hurried.” She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them. “And there’s work aplenty to while the time for us here.”\nJessica hesitated. “The thing must take its course.” That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva’s stock of incantations— The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.\nBut I’m not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: “What’ll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?”\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.”\nMapes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head,” she said. She stooped. “lIl have to be cleaning this first, won’t I, my Lady?”\n“No.”\n“But there’s dirt caked on its horns.”\n“That’s not dirt, Mapes. That’s the blood of our Duke’s father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is the bound concubine of Duke Leto and the mother of his heir-designate.
