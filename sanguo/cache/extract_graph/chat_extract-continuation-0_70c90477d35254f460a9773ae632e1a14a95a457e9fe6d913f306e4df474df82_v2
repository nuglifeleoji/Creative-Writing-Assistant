且说崔禹正行之间，忽见火起，急催兵前进。刚才转过山来，忽山谷中鼓声大震：左边关兴，右边张苞，两路夹攻。崔禹大惊，方欲奔走，正遇张苞；交马只一合，被苞生擒而回。朱然听知危急，将船往下水退五六十里去了。孙桓引败军逃走，问部将曰：“前去何处城坚粮广？”部将曰：“此去正北彝陵城，可以屯兵。”桓引败军急望彝陵而走。方进得城，吴班等追至，将城四面围定。关兴、张苞等解崔禹到秭归来。先主大喜，传旨将崔禹斩却，大赏三军。自此威风震动，江南诸将无不胆寒。\n\n    却说孙桓令人求救于吴王，吴王大惊，即召文武商议曰：“今孙桓受困于彝陵，朱然大败于江中，蜀兵势大，如之奈何？”张昭奏曰：“今诸将虽多物故，然尚有十余人，何虑于刘备？可命韩当为正将，周泰为副将，潘璋为先锋，凌统为合后，甘宁为救应，起兵十万拒之。”权依所奏，即命诸将速行。此时甘宁已患痢疾，带病从征。\n\n    却说先主从巫峡建平起，直接彝陵界分，七十余里，连结四十余寨；见关兴、张苞屡立大功，叹曰：“昔日从朕诸将，皆老迈无用矣；复有二侄如此英雄，朕何虑孙权乎！”正言间，忽报韩当、周泰领兵来到。先主方欲遣将迎敌，近臣奏曰：“老将黄忠，引五六人投东吴去了。”先主笑曰：“黄汉升非反叛之人也；因朕失口误言老者无用，彼必不服老，故奋力去相持矣。”即召关兴、张苞曰：“黄汉升此去必然有失。贤侄休辞劳苦，可去相助。略有微功，便可令回，勿使有失。”二小将拜辞先主，引本部军来助黄忠。正是：老臣素矢忠君志，年少能成报国功。未知黄忠此去如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第八十三回　战猇亭先主得仇人　守江口书生拜大将\n\n
