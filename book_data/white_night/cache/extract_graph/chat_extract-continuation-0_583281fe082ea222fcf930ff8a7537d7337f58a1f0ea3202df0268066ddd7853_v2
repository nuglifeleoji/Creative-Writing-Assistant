三三三寝室这三位的分数加起来，在班上绝对是垫底的，谁让最后两名都是他们寝室的呢？刘锋和钱磊低着头，恨不得找个地缝钻进去。但牧重天的下一句话，令他们瞬间露出了愕然之色。\n\n    “在这次身体素质测试中，获得加号最多的小组是，三三三小组，一共四个加号。让我们恭喜他们。根据学院先前确定的方案，获得加号最多的小组，不会在期末考试后被淘汰。”\n\n    此言一出，全班一片哗然。\n\n    幸福来得太突然了，以至于刘锋和钱磊都有些发蒙，蓝轩宇也不禁愣住了。\n\n    而对于其他学员来说，这绝不是一个好消息啊！按照开学时所说的，每学期期末考试后，高能少年班都有可能有学员被淘汰。\n\n    而在大家看来，最有可能被淘汰的当然是刘锋他们这一组了。\n\n    可现在，谁也没想到，他们这最弱的一组居然获得了四个加号，从而不会被淘汰。\n\n    这样的话，淘汰的名额会落在谁身上可就不好说了啊！大家能够考入高能少年班，成绩的差距本来就不大。\n\n    “老师，这不公平。在综合实力上，他们小组绝对是最弱的啊！不能因为某方面好一点就获得这么大的优待，这对我们不公平。”金翔毫不犹豫地跳出来。\n\n    在蓝轩宇来之前，他其实就和刘锋比试过，当时是赢了刘锋的。\n\n    所以蓝轩宇刚来的时候，他才主动挑衅，却让蓝轩宇赢了。\n\n    记仇那是肯定的。牧重天淡淡地道：“这是学院的决定，你有什么不满可以向学院提出来。还有，下午的实战考核，你们也可以努力去战胜他们。今天下午实战考核第一名的小组也将拥有不被淘汰的资格。所以，努力吧，少年们。下课。”说完，牧老师扭头就走了。\n\n    顿时，班里响起一片议论声。“我们这是‘上岸’了啊！哈哈哈！”钱磊忍不住大笑起来。刘锋碰了他一下，表情不太好。钱磊这才发现，周围投过来的都是不太友善的目光。“走吧，我们去吃饭。”蓝轩宇一拉两位室友，率先离开了测试场地。食堂。\n\n    钱磊一边吃着饭，一边压低声音对蓝轩宇和刘锋低声说道：“该是我们一鸣惊人的时候了，下午就让他们知道我们的厉害！轩宇，就靠你了！”\n\n    “嗯。”蓝轩宇答应着。\n\n    钱磊继续道：“你说，下午咱们要暴露多少啊？拿出多少实力能赢，获得冠军?这算不算是双料冠军啊？”\n\n    “嗯？”蓝轩宇抬头看了他一眼。刘锋没好气地道：“你能要点脸吗?上午谁垫底来着?还好意思说‘冠军’这种话。”\n\n    钱磊撤了撤嘴：“谁倒数第\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
