轮值主席，以后的二十多年中，他自己也记不清担任过多少次这个短暂的职务，但这是最后一次了，已经满头白发的他即将退休。\n　　“面壁者雷迪砸兹，如果你说的是事实，那这种做法是不适宜的，只要面壁计划的原则继续有效，面壁者就享有法律豁免权，他们的任何言行都不能在法律上作为有罪指控的证据。”伽尔宁说。\n　　“而且，请注意，这里是国际领土。”日本代表说。\n　　“那是不是说……”美国代表竖起手中的铅笔，“等雷迪亚兹把一百万枚超级核弹都埋到水星上准备引爆时，人类社会仍然不能对他进行有罪指控？”\n　　“依据面壁法案中的相应条款，对面壁者表现出危险倾向的战略计划进行限制和制止，与面壁者本人的法律豁免权是两回事。”伽尔宁说。\n　　“雷迪亚兹的罪行已经越出了法律豁免权的底线，必须受到惩罚，这是面壁计划继续存在的前提。”英国代表说。\n　　“我提请主席先生和各位代表注意。”雷迪亚兹从座位上站起身说，“这是行星防御委员会的面壁计划听证会，而不是对本人的审判法庭。”\n　　“您会很快站到那个法庭上的。”美国代表冷笑着说。\n　　“同意面壁者雷迪亚兹，我们应该回到对他的战略计划本身的讨论上来。”\n　　伽尔宁立刻抓住了这次暂时绕过棘手问题的机会。\n　　一直沉默的日本代表发言：“从现在看来，各位代表已对如下一点达成了共识：雷迪亚兹的战略计划存在着明显的侵犯人类生存权的危险倾向，依据面壁法案相应的原则，应该予以制止。”\n　　“那么，上次会议提出的关于中止面壁者雷迪亚兹战略计划的P269 号提案应该可以投票表决了。”伽尔宁说。\n　　“主席先生，请等等。”雷迪亚兹举起一只手说，“在表决前，我希望对自己战略计划的一些细节进行最后陈述。”\n　　“如果仅仅是细节，有必要吗？”有人问。\n　　“您可以到法庭上说。”英国代表讥讽道。\n　　“不，这个细节很重要，现在，我们假设破壁人所公布的我的战略意图是真实的。”雷迪亚兹坚持说下去，“刚才有代表提到一百万颗氢弹在水星上部署完毕准备引爆的情况，届时我会对着无所不在的智子向三体世界发出人类的同归于尽宣言，在那一时刻，会发生什么？”\n　　“三体人的反应无法预\n######################\nOutput:",
