�按兵不出。姜维令军辱骂。邓艾寻思曰：“蜀人被吾大杀一阵，全然不退，连日反来搦战：必分兵去袭祁山寨也。守寨将师纂，兵少智寡，必然败矣。吾当亲往救之。”乃唤子邓忠分付曰：“汝用心守把此处，任他搦战，却勿轻出。吾今夜引兵去祁山救应。”\n\n    是夜二更，姜维正在寨中设计，忽听得寨外喊声震地，鼓角喧天，人报邓艾引三千精兵夜战。诸将欲出，维止之曰：“勿得妄动。”原来邓艾引兵至蜀寨前哨探了一遍，乘势去救祁山，邓忠自入城去了。姜维唤诸将曰：“邓艾虚作夜战之势，必然去救祁山寨矣。”乃唤傅佥分付曰：“汝守此寨，勿轻与敌。”嘱毕，维自引三千兵来助张翼。\n\n    却说张翼正到祁山攻打，守寨将师纂兵少，支持不住。看看待破，忽然邓艾兵至，冲杀了一阵，蜀兵大败，把张翼隔在山后，绝了归路。正慌急之间，忽听的喊声大震，鼓角喧天，只见魏兵纷纷倒退。左右报曰：“大将军姜伯约杀到！”翼乘势驱兵相应。两下夹攻，邓艾折了一阵，急退上祁山寨不出。姜维令兵四面攻围。话分两头。却说后主在成都，听信宦官黄皓之言，又溺于酒色，不理朝政。时有大臣刘琰妻胡氏，极有颜色；因入宫朝见皇后，后留在宫中，一月方出。琰疑其妻与后主私通，乃唤帐下军士五百人，列于前，将妻绑缚，令军以履挞其面数十，几死复苏。后主闻之大怒，令有司议刘琰罪。有司议得：“卒非挞妻之人，面非受刑之地：合当弃市。”遂斩刘琰。自此命妇不许入朝。然一时官僚以后主荒淫，多有疑怨者。于是贤人渐退，小人日进。时右将军阎宇，身无寸功，只因阿附黄皓，遂得重爵；闻姜维统兵在祁山，乃说皓奏后主曰：“姜维屡战无功，可命阎宇代之。”后主从其言，遣使赍诏，召回姜维。维正在祁山攻打寨栅，忽一日三道诏至，宣维班师。维只得遵命，先令洮阳兵退，次后与张翼徐徐而退。邓艾在寨中，只听得一夜鼓角喧天，不知何意。至平明，人报蜀兵尽退，止留空寨。艾疑有计，不敢追袭。姜维径到汉中，歇住人马，自与使命入成都见后主。后主一连十日不朝。维心中疑惑。是日至东华门，遇见秘书郎郤正。维问曰：“天子召维班师，公知其故否？”正笑曰：“大将�\n######################\nOutput:",
