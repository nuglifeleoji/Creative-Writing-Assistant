梦见头上忽生二角，醒来甚是疑异。次日，行军司马赵直至，延请入问曰：“久知足下深明《易》理，吾夜梦头生二角，不知主何吉凶？烦足下为我决之。”赵直想了半晌，答曰：“此大吉之兆：麒麟头上有角，苍龙头上有角，乃变化飞腾之象也。”延大喜曰：“如应公言，当有重谢！”直辞去，行不数里，正遇尚书费祎。祎问何来。直曰：“适至魏文长营中，文长梦头生角，令我决其吉凶。此本非吉兆，但恐直言见怪，因以麒麟苍龙解之。”祎曰：“足下何以知非吉兆？”直曰：“角之字形，乃刀下用也。今头上用刀，其凶甚矣！”祎曰：“君且勿泄漏。”直别去。费祎至魏延寨中，屏退左右，告曰：“昨夜三更，丞相已辞世矣。临终再三嘱付，令将军断后以当司马懿，缓缓而退，不可发丧。今兵符在此，便可起兵。”延曰：“何人代理丞相之大事？”祎曰：“丞相一应大事，尽托与杨仪；用兵密法，皆授与姜伯约。此兵符乃杨仪之令也。”延曰：“丞相虽亡，吾今现在。杨仪不过一长史，安能当此大任？他只宜扶柩入川安葬。我自率大兵攻司马懿，务要成功。岂可因丞相一人而废国家大事耶？”祎曰：“丞相遗令，教且暂退，不可有违。”延怒曰：“丞相当时若依我计，取长安久矣！吾今官任前将军、征西大将军、南郑侯，安肯与长史断后！“祎曰：“将军之言虽是，然不可轻动，令敌人耻笑。待吾往见杨仪，以利害说之，令彼将兵权让与将军，何如？”延依其言。\n\n

祎辞延出营，急到大寨见杨仪，具述魏延之语。仪曰：“丞相临终，曾密嘱我曰：魏延必有异志。今我以兵符往，实欲探其心耳。今果应丞相之言。吾自令伯约断后可也。”于是杨仪领兵扶柩先行，令姜维断后；依孔明遗令，徐徐而退。魏延在寨中，不见费祎来回覆，心中疑惑，乃令马岱引十数骑往探消息。回报曰：“后军乃姜维总督，前军大半退入谷中去了。”延大怒曰：“竖儒安敢欺我！我必杀之！”因顾谓岱曰：“公肯相助否？”岱曰：“某亦素恨杨仪，今愿助将军攻之。”延大喜，即拔寨引本部兵望南而行。\n\n
