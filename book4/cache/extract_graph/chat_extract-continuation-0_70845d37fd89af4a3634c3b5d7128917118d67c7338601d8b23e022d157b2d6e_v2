\n　　王彩娥的几个兄弟听到消息，一打早就动员了本族几十条好汉，操起家具向双水村赶来了……在农村，从古代到现代，似乎有一条不成文的“法规”：此类“桃色事件”可以不经官方，由户族与户族之间解决。这就意味着暴力与战争。在历史上，这种事件往往酿成了惨痛的流血和屠杀。户族、种族之间的冲突，也许是人类最大的悲剧。这种战争往往是由一些鸡毛蒜皮引起的，而且根本分不清谁是谁非，结果就让许多人毫无意义地倒在了血泊之中。 \n　　王氏家族的武士们首先冲进了金俊斌家的院子。金富和金强尽管是打架老手，但寡不敌众，没几个回合就被乱棍打得抱头鼠窜了。 \n　　彩娥家被关住的门很快打开。孙玉亭乘混乱之机，赶紧冲出了人群，向哭咽河后沟道里落荒而逃，一霎时就不见了踪影；王彩娥两把抖乱了自己的头发，哭骂着爬上了金俊文家的窑顶，要往他家的院子里跳，给金家遭人命，被她的一个弟弟硬拉住了。 \n　　与此同时，一些王姓后生开始砸金俊文和金俊武家的窑檐石；另外一些人分别冲进这两家人的院子，见什么砸什么。有的人已经开始往家里冲。金俊武、金俊文和金富弟兄分别拿着切菜刀和杀猪刀子把在自家的门口，准备决一死战。村中所有看热闹的人立即四散而逃了。大人拉着娃娃，哭叫声响成一片，那情景真是混乱得如同战争一般。 \n　　约摸十分钟以后，金家户族里的二十来条后生，也操起家具，向金俊武家赶来了。作为同宗同族的人，他们自觉地负起了传统的责任；当这类事发生后，本族有人遭外族大规模进攻的时候，有义务用同样的方式聚合起来与之对抗。这种关头，作为同族人，就是历史上或现实中相互之间有嫌隙，也暂时被放在一边，要庄严地为神圣的传统原则而战了！ \n　　金家户族的人很快冲进了两个院子，和外村的王姓展开了一场混战。金俊武父子弟兄们看见本族人赶来支援他们，都感动得眼里涌满了泪水。 \n　　在这混战的人群中，只有一个毫无缘由的两旁世人也在参战——田二的憨儿子田牛。田牛在混战开始、外姓人纷纷撤退的时候，他觉得更有意思了，竟然笑嘻嘻地顺手拉了一根柴棍子，也搀和到里面打开了。他不分敌我，见谁打谁。王姓户族的人以为他\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
