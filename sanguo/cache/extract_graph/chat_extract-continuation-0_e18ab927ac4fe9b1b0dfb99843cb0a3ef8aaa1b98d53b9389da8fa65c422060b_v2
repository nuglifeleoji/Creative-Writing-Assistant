�一阵，可尽复诸营，夺其粮食马匹。此是借寨与彼屯辎重耳。今夜留霍峻守关，孟将军可与我搬粮草夺马匹，小将军看我破敌！”\n\n    是夜二更，忠引五千军开关直下。原来夏侯尚、韩浩二将连日见关上不出，尽皆懈怠；被黄忠破寨直入，人不及甲，马不及鞍，二将各自逃命而走，军马自相践踏，死者无数。比及天明，连夺三寨。寨中丢下军器鞍马无数，尽教孟达搬运入关。黄忠催军马随后而进，刘封曰：“军士力困，可以暂歇。”忠曰：“不入虎穴，焉得虎子？”策马先进。士卒皆努力向前。张郃军兵，反被自家败兵冲动，都屯扎不住，望后而走；尽弃了许多寨栅，直奔至汉水傍。\n\n    张郃寻见夏侯尚、韩浩议曰：“此天荡山，乃粮草之所；更接米仓山，亦屯粮之地：是汉中军士养命之源。倘若疏失，是无汉中也。当思所以保之。”夏侯尚曰：“米仓山有吾叔夏侯渊分兵守护，那里正接定军山，不必忧虑。天荡山有吾兄夏侯德镇守，我等宜往投之，就保此山。”\n\n    于是张郃与二将连夜投天荡山来，见夏侯德，具言前事。夏侯德曰：“吾此处屯十万兵，你可引去，复取原寨。”郃曰：“只宜坚守、不可妄动。”忽听山前金鼓大震，人报黄忠兵到。夏侯德大笑曰：“老贼不谙兵法，只恃勇耳！”郃曰：“黄忠有谋，非止勇也。”德曰：“川兵远涉而来，连日疲困，更兼深入战境，此无谋也！”郃曰：“亦不可轻敌，且宜坚守。”韩浩曰：“愿借精兵三千击之，当无不克。”德遂分兵与浩下山。\n\n    黄忠整兵来迎。刘封谏曰：“日已西沉矣，军皆远来劳困，且宜暂息。”忠笑曰：“不然。此天赐奇功，不取是逆天也。”言毕，鼓噪大进。韩浩引兵来战。黄忠挥刀直取浩，只一合，斩浩于马下。蜀兵大喊，杀上山来。张郃、夏侯尚急引军来迎。忽听山后大喊，火光冲天而起，上下通红。夏侯德提兵来救火时，正遇老将严颜，手起刀落，斩夏侯德于马下。原来黄忠预先使严颜引军埋伏于山僻去处，只等黄忠军到，却来放火，柴草堆上，一齐点着，烈焰飞腾，照耀山峪。严颜既斩夏侯德，从山后杀来。张郃、夏侯尚前后不能相顾，只得弃天荡山，望定军山投奔夏侯渊去了。\n\n
