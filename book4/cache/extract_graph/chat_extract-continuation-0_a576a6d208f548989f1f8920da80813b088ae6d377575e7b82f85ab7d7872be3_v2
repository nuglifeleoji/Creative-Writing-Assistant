\n　　“要是公家政策变了，不再让顶班招工，这就麻烦了！”金波不再言传。 \n　　父亲的这个提醒倒使他一惊。是的，中国的这类政策常常说变就变，往往一夜之间赶不上趟，就把人的命运改变了。 \n　　但他的确不忍心从父亲手里把方向盘夺过来。对于一个有血性的青年来说，自己无力谋生，靠剥夺父亲在这个世界上活着，即便不是堕落，那也实在脸上无光。 \n　　过了好一会，他才对父亲说：“再等一等看吧！” \n　　金俊海叹了口气，说：“还能等出个啥结果来……”午饭之前，父子俩就到了双水村。 \n　　他们把汽车停在田家圪崂这面的公路上，就淌过东拉河，回金家湾那面的家里去吃饭。这趟车的终点在沙漠中的一个城市里，通常到双水村后，金俊海就留在家里，由儿子一个人去完成这趟公差。如果单位上知道金俊海如此不忠于职守，恐怕他年终那张奖状是领不成了。生活中的好人也常常干这种错事。 \n　　吃过午饭后，金波就一个人开着车继续向北行驶。 \n　　越往北走，大地就越荒凉。山脉缓坦起来，人烟村舍逐渐稀疏了。临近黄土高原另一个地区所在地的城市时，已经出现了沙丘。穿过这座塞上古城，越过秦时残断的古长城线，黄土几乎完全消失了，展现在眼前的是一望无际的大沙漠。 \n　　公路在弧线优美的沙丘中蜿蜒曲折地伸展，路面常常被沙子掩埋，甚至都看不清路迹。在沙漠中行车是十分令人痛快的。尽管路面不好，但车辆少，不要担心撞碰。即是乱跑，也没什么大危险，柔软的沙丘不会碰坏汽车的。 \n　　一到沙漠上，金波就感到心情无限地舒展起来。视野的开阔使他想起一望无际的青海大草原。在他看来，那无边的沙丘不是静止的，而象滚动的潮头涌涌而来；这也使他想起了草原上那奔腾的马群。太痛快了！几十里路碰不见一辆车，也看不见一个人。他漫不经心地开着车穿行在这波山浪谷之中，嘴里由不得“哇哇”地乱喊乱叫，或放开嗓门唱几段子歌。在夏季的时候，他还常常把车停在沙漠中的一个小海子边，脱得一丝不挂，跳到水里去游泳；游完，再把身上的所有的衣服都洗了，晾在草地上，自己赤裸裸地躺在沙丘上晒太阳；望着蓝天上悠悠的白云，无限止地回想那个遥远的地方和那个不知去向的姑娘……春天的沙漠依\n######################\nOutput:",
