The sandworms are inextricably linked to the production of the spice melange, a substance vital to interstellar travel and the economy of the Imperium. Their absence in Leto II's vision of the future foreshadows a time without spice, underscoring their indispensable role in the fate of Arrakis and the universe at large.
