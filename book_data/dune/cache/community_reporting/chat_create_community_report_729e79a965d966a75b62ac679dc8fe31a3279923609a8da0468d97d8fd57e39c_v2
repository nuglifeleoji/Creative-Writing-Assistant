The narrator feels a profound sense of responsibility to fulfill this promise, indicating that it holds significant weight in their relationship. This commitment is not merely a formal agreement; it represents a deep emotional bond and a moral obligation that the narrator grapples with throughout the narrative.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"\"承诺\"\" is central to the narrator's internal struggles, highlighting the tension between personal expectations and the expectations placed upon them by others. This duality suggests that the narrator is not only concerned with honoring the commitment to Elizabeth but is also navigating their own desires and the pressures of societal norms. The commitment thus serves as a pivotal point in the narrator's journey, reflecting the complexities of love, duty, and self-identity.\n\nIn summary, \"\"承诺\"\" encapsulates the narrator's marriage vow to Elizabeth, embodying a sense of responsibility and moral obligation. It is a source of internal conflict, as the narrator balances their own expectations with those of others, making it a crucial theme in their emotional and relational development.\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1398,角色,魔鬼,魔鬼是角色面临的威胁，逼近并质问角色的行为,49\r\n1235,承诺,婚礼,承诺使得叙述者无法轻松地进入婚礼的状态。,12\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
