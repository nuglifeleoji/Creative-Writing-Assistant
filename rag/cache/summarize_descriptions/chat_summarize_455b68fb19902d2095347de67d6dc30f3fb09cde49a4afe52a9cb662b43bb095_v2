Leto's pursuit is fueled by the possibility that The Preacher could indeed be Paul Muad'Dib, leading him to actively seek answers through direct questioning. His resolve underscores a personal and urgent need for clarity regarding The Preacher's origins and connection to his lineage.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Leto's unwavering focus on this mission, with no contradictions in his intent or reasoning. His actions are consistently motivated by the suspicion that The Preacher holds the key to uncovering the truth about his father's fate.
