As her tutor, he is empathetic toward her academic pressures and supports educational approaches that reduce excessive testing.  \n\n正晴's connection to 雪穗 extends beyond academics; he harbors personal feelings for her and becomes entangled in the events surrounding her life. He investigates incidents linked to her, including the death of **西本文代 (Nishimoto Fumiyo)**, 雪穗's mother, which is speculated to be either a suicide or an accident. Through conversations with **田川 (Tagawa)**, he gathers information about the circumstances of her mother's passing. 正晴 also lends 雪穗 a cassette tape, further deepening their interactions.  \n\nHis involvement in the *Submarine* program leak investigation highlights his technical expertise, while his emotional investment in 雪穗's well-being reveals a compassionate and concerned side.
