He is a member of the Communist Party and serves in various leadership roles, including as a village leader, deputy commander overseeing construction operations, and a key assistant to 田福堂, a significant figure in the village. His responsibilities include organizing community events, managing local labor, and addressing issues related to agricultural reform and education.\n\n孙玉亭 is known for his strong personality and commitment to revolutionary ideals, often expressing opposition to capitalist influences, particularly those proposed by his nephew, 孙少安. He is actively engaged in political activities, planning events to invite local officials and advocating for the villagers' unity in their struggles. His leadership is symbolized by his role in significant ceremonies, such as lighting a torch during an ignition ceremony and organizing criticism meetings.\n\nDespite his strong exterior, 孙玉亭 experiences moments of vulnerability and anxiety, particularly in the face of family conflicts and societal changes. He feels disconnected from the community after the implementation of the responsibility system and reflects on his past, grappling with feelings of loss and loneliness. His relationships are complex; he has a strained connection with 金俊武 and is involved in mediating disputes within the community, including those related to marriage proposals and family tensions.\n\n孙玉亭 also demonstrates compassion and empathy, as seen when he comforts a father and son by the river. He is involved in practical matters, such as advising villagers on dealing with fishbone injuries and proposing solutions for local agricultural issues, including pig raising. His dedication to the community is evident in his efforts to maintain public facilities and support educational initiatives, such as establishing a junior high school class.\n\nHowever, his involvement in local politics is not without controversy. He is linked to past incidents, such as the \"\"麻糊事件,\"\" which caused significant disturbances in the village. His relationships with other villagers, including his brother 孙玉厚 and his nephew 孙少安, are marked by tension, particularly regarding property divisions and personal choices.\n\nIn summary, 孙玉亭 is a complex character embodying the struggles and aspirations of 双水村. He is a revolutionary figure committed to the community's welfare, yet he navigates personal conflicts and societal changes that challenge his ideals and relationships.
