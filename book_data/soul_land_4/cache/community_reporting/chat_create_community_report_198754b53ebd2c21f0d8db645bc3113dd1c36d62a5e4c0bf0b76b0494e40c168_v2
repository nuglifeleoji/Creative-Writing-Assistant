Aged 5 and above, they are actively involved in national conferences, where they provide input and directives to the FG system, reflecting their desires for an ideal state and responding to proposals put forth by the government. This engagement highlights their significance as citizens who express their aspirations and concerns for the future.\n\nIn the aftermath of a disaster, children under 11 years old are particularly affected, as they are scattered across a vast territory and face various crises without effective leadership or support. This situation underscores their vulnerability and the challenges they encounter in a rapidly changing environment. Despite these hardships, children over the age of eight are emerging as a crucial part of the workforce, learning quickly and contributing to recovery efforts, showcasing their resilience and adaptability.\n\nChildren also play a symbolic role in the narrative of societal change. They are depicted as witnesses to significant events, such as the observation of the Rose Nebula from the A-type building, representing the next generation that is experiencing profound transformations in the universe. This imagery emphasizes their position as both participants and observers in a world marked by loss and change.\n\nIn discussions about the future of their country, children are divided into groups with differing opinions, reflecting a spectrum of perspectives on national issues. This division illustrates their active engagement in civic matters, as they contribute suggestions for the national five-year plan, particularly advocating for the development of entertainment facilities that cater to their needs and interests.\n\nMoreover, children like Hua Hua and Xiao Meng serve as representatives of innocence and vulnerability, embodying the emotional weight of their experiences in the face of adversity. They are not only the audience for the capabilities of the FG system but also symbolize the hope and potential of the younger generation as they navigate the complexities of their environment.\n\nIn summary, children are a significant and multifaceted group within society, actively participating in national dialogues, contributing to recovery efforts, and embodying both the challenges and hopes of their generation. Their involvement in shaping the future reflects their importance as citizens and their capacity to influence the direction of their communities and the nation as a whole.\",28\n449,SUPERNOVA DISASTER,\"The supernova disaster has left over 300 million children under 11 years old in a precarious situation, with many under 5 years old lacking basic survival skills.\",2\n392,SLEEP,\"The act of sleeping signifies a temporary escape from reality, representing the children's desire to find solace amidst their grief.\",1\n407,A-TYPE BUILDING,\"The A-type building is a structure from which two children observed the Rose Nebula, symbolizing human architecture in the aftermath of the supernova.\",1\n451,COLD NIGHTS,\"The cold nights following the Great Death have contributed to the fear and suffering of the children, making them reluctant to leave their homes.\",1\n452,TELEVISION AND RADIO,\"The television and radio are communication mediums that the children rely on, but they are receiving no information, leading to increased feelings of isolation.\",1\n732,NATIONAL WORK PLAN,,1\n830,AGRICULTURE,\"Agriculture is being restored as a critical aspect of human survival, with children playing a major role in its recovery.\",1\n831,TRANSPORTATION,\"Transportation systems are being gradually restored, including roads, railways, and air routes, which are essential for connecting regions.\",1\n1148,ALCOHOLISM WAVE,\"A significant event characterized by a surge in alcoholism among children, resulting in severe societal and health consequences.\",1\n1150,WATER SYSTEM,\"The city's water system, partially operational, is crucial for providing drinking water to children amidst the chaos.\",1\n448,NATION,\"The nation in question is characterized by a vast territory spanning 9.6 million square kilometers.
