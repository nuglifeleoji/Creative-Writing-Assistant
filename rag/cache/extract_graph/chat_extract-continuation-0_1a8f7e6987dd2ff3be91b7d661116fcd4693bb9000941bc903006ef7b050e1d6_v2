God formed me to deceive the powindah! His slight, childlike appearance was formed in a gray skin whose metallic pigments blocked scanning probes. His diminutive shape distracted those who saw him and hid the powers he had accumulated in serial ghola incarnations. Only the Bene Gesserit carried older memories, but he knew evil guided them.\nScytale rubbed his breast, reminding himself of what was hidden there with such skill that not even a scar marked the place. Each Master had carried this resource—a nullentropy capsule preserving the seed cells of a multitude: fellow Masters of the central kehl, Face Dancers, technical specialists and others he knew would be attractive to the women of Shaitan ... and to many weakling powindah! Paul Atreides and his beloved Chani were there. (Oh what that had cost in searching garments of the dead for random cells!) The original Duncan Idaho was there with other Atreides minions—the Mentat Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck, the Fremen Naib Stilgar .. . enough potential servants and Slaves to people a Tleilaxu universe.\nThe prize of prizes in the nullentropy tube, the ones he longed to bring into existence, made him catch his breath\nwhen he thought of them. Perfect Face Dancers! Perfect mimics. Perfect recorders of a victim’s persona. Capable of deceiving even the witches of the Bene Gesserit. Not even shere could prevent them from capturing the mind of another.\nThe tube he thought of as his ultimate bargaining power. No one must know of it. For now, he catalogued flaws.\nThere were enough gaps in the no-ship’s defenses to gratify him. In his serial lifetimes, he had collected skills the way his fellow Masters collected pleasing baubles. They had always considered him too serious but now he had found the place and time for vindication.\nStudy of the Bene Gesserit had always attracted him. Over the eons, he had acquired a body of knowledge about them. He knew it held myths and misinformation, but faith in the purposes of God assured him the view he held would serve the Great Belief, no matter the rigors of Holy Testing.\nPart of his Bene Gesserit catalogue he called “typicals,” from the frequent remark: “That’s typical of them!”\nThe typicals fascinated him.\nIt was typical for them to tolerate gross but non- threatening behavior in others they would not accept in themselves. “Bene Gesserit standards are higher.” Scytale had heard that even from some of his late companions.\n“We have the gift of seeing ourselves as others see us,” Odrade had once said.\nScytale included this among typical/s, but her words did not accord with the Great Belief. Only God saw your ultimate self! Odrade’s boast had the sound of hubris.\n“They tell no casual lies. Truth serves them better.”\nHe often wondered about that. Mother Superior herself quoted it as a rule of the Bene Gesserit. There remained the fact that witches appeared to hold a cynical view of truth. She dared claim it was Zensunni. “Whose truth? Modified in what way? In what context?”\nThey had been seated the previous afternoon in his no- ship quarters. He had asked for “a consultation on mutual problems,” his euphemism for bargaining. They were alone except for comeyes and the comings and goings of watchful Sisters.\nHis quarters were comfortable enough: three plaz-walled rooms in restful green, a soft bed, chairs reduced to fit his diminutive body.\nThis was an Ixian no-ship and he felt certain his warders did not suspect how much he knew of it. As much as the Ixians. \\xian machines all around but never an Ixian to be seen. He doubted there was a single Ixian on Chapterhouse. The witches were notorious for doing their own maintenance.\nOdrade moved and spoke slowly, watching him with care. “They are not impulsive.” You heard that often.\nShe asked after his comfort and appeared concerned for him.\nHe glanced around his sitting room. “I see no Ixians.”\nShe pursed her lips with displeasure. “Is this why you asked for consultation?”\nOf course not, witch! | merely practice my arts of distraction. You would not expect me to mention things | wished to conceal. Then why would I call your attention to Ixians when I know it is unlikely there are any dangerous intruders walking freely on your accursed planet? Ahhh, the much vaunted Ixian connection we Tleilaxu maintained so long. You know of that! You punished Ix memorably more than once.\nThe technocrats of Ix might hesitate to irritate the Bene Gesserit, he thought, but they would be extremely careful not to arouse the ire of Honored Matres. Secret trading was indicated by the presence of this no-ship but the price must have been ruinous and the circumlocutions exceptional. Very nasty, those whores from the Scattering. They might need Ix themselves, he guessed. And Ix might secretly defy\nthe whores to make an arrangement with the Bene Gesserit. But the limits were tight and chances of betrayal many.\nThese thoughts comforted him as he bargained. Odrade, in a brittle mood, unsettled him several times with silences during which she stared at him in that disturbing Bene Gesserit way.\nThe bargaining chips were large—no less than survival for each of them and always in the pot that tenuous thing: ascendancy, control of the human universe, perpetuation of your own ways as the dominant pattern.\nGive me a small opening that | may expand, Scytale thought. Give me my own Face Dancers. Give me servants who will do only my bidding.\n“It is a small thing to ask,” he said. “I seek personal comfort, my own servants.”\nOdrade continued to stare at him in that weighted way of the Bene Gesserit that always seemed to peel away the masks and see deep into you.\nBut | have masks you have not penetrated.\nHe could see that she found him repulsive—the way her gaze fixed sequentially on each of his features. He knew what she was thinking. An e/fin figure with narrow face and puckish eyes. Widow’s peak. Her gaze moved down: tiny mouth with sharp teeth and pointed canines.\nScytale knew himself to be a figure out of humankind’s most dangerously disturbing mythologies. Odrade would ask herself: Why did the Bene Tleilax choose this particular physical appearance when their control of genetics could have given them something more impressive?\nFor the very reason that it disturbs you, powindah dirt!\nHe thought immediately of another typica/: “The Bene Gesserit seldom scatter dirt.”\nScytale had seen the dirty aftermath of many Bene Gesserit actions. Look at what happened to Dune! Burnt to cinders because you women of Shaitan chose that holy\nground to challenge the whores. Even the revenants of our Prophet gone to their reward. Everyone dead!\nAnd he hardly dared contemplate his own losses. No Tleilaxu planet had escaped the fate of Dune. The Bene Gesserit caused that! And he must suffer their tolerance—a refugee with only God to support him.\nHe asked Odrade about scattered dirt on Dune.\n“You find that only when we are in extremis.”\n“Is that why you attracted the violence of those whores?”\nShe refused to discuss it.\nOne of Scytale’s late companions had said: “The Bene Gesserit leave straight tracks. You might think them complex, but when you look closely their way smooths.”\nThat companion and all the others had been butchered by the whores. His only survival lay in cells of a nullentropy capsule. So much for a dead Master’s wisdom!\nOdrade wanted more technical information about axlotl tanks. Ohhhh, how cleverly she worded her questions!\nBargaining for survival, and each little bit carried a heavy weight. What had he received for his tiny measured pieces of data about the axlotl tanks? Odrade took him out of the ship occasionally now. But the whole planet was as much a prison to him as this ship. Where could he go that the witches would not find him?\nWhat were they doing with their own axlotl tanks? He was not even sure about this. The witches lied with such facility.\nWas it wrong to supply them even with limited knowledge? He realized now he had told them far more than the bare biotechnical details to which he had confined himself. They definitely deduced how Masters had created a limited immortality—always a ghola-replacement growing in the tanks. That, too, was lost! He wanted to scream this at her in his frustrated rage.\nQuestions ... obvious questions.\nHe parried her questions with wordy arguments about “my need for Face Dancer servants and my own Shipsystem\nconsole.”\nShe was slyly adamant, probing for more knowledge of the tanks. “The information to produce melange from our tanks might induce us to be more liberal with our guest.”\nOur tanks! Our guest!\nThese women were like a plasteel wall. No tanks for his personal use. Al// of that Tleilaxu power gone. It was a thought full of mournful self-pity. He restored himself with a reminder: God obviously tested his resourcefulness. They think they hold me in a trap. But their restrictions hurt. No Face Dancer servants? Very well. He would seek other servants. Not Face Dancers.\nScytale felt the deepest anguish of his many lives when he thought of his lost Face Dancers—his mutable slaves. Damn these women and their pretense that they shared the Great Belief! Omnipresent acolytes and Reverend Mothers always snooping around. Spies! And comeyes everywhere. Oppressive.\nOn first coming to Chapterhouse, he had sensed a shyness about his jailers, a privacy that became intense when he probed into the workings of their order. Later, he came to see this as a circling up, all facing outward at any threat. What is ours is ours. You may not enter!\nScytale recognized a parental posturing in this, a maternal view of humankind: “Behave or we will punish you!” And Bene Gesserit punishments certainly were to be avoided.\nAs Odrade continued to demand more than he would give, Scytale fastened his attention on a typical he felt sure was true: They cannot love. But he was forced to agree. Neither love nor hate were purely rational. He thought of such emotions as a dark fountain shadowing the air all around, a primitive gusher that sprayed unsuspecting humans.\nHow this woman does chatter! He watched her, not really listening. What were their flaws? Was it a weakness that\nthey avoided music? Did they fear the secret play on emotions? The aversion appeared to be heavily conditioned, but the conditioning did not always succeed. In his many lives he had seen witches appear to enjoy music. When he questioned Odrade, she became quite heated, and he suspected a deliberate display to mislead him.\n“We cannot let ourselves be distracted!”\n“Don’t you ever replay great musical performances in memory? I’m told that in ancient times...”\n“Of what use is music played on instruments no longer known to most people?”\n“Oh? What instruments are those?”\n“Where would you find a piano?” Still in that false anger. “Terrible instruments to tune and even more difficult to play.”\nHow prettily she protests. “lve never heard of this... this .. . piano, did you say? Is it like the baliset?”\n“Distant cousins. But it could only be tuned to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>Scytale is a Tleilaxu Master with a childlike appearance, capable of deception and possessing hidden powers.
