Primarily composed of planet-bound entrepreneurs and minor aristocrats, they play a significant role in controlling Arrakis' interior trade under Harkonnen oversight. The Baron seeks to dominate these families through political manipulation, including the use of hostages, ensuring their loyalty and compliance. While they operate with some autonomy, the Houses Minor largely follow the directives of major houses like the Harkonnens, often appearing at the Baron's gatherings as part of his broader strategy to consolidate power. Their influence is economic and political, serving as intermediaries in the harsh desert world's trade networks while remaining firmly under the thumb of their more powerful patrons.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251756, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 373, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 152}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
