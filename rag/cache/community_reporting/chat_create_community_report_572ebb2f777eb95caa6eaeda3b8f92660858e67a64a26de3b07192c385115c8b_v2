The prison is frequently associated with **hostage exchanges**, **Fremen justice**, and **political detainment**, serving as a symbol of oppression and control. While its exact affiliation has shifted over time—with references to **Harkonnen operations**, **Sardaukar control**, or **Tleilaxu captivity**—the consensus identifies it as a **Tiruzian facility**, with occasional ambiguous mentions placing it on **Gammu** or under **Honored Matre** jurisdiction.  \n\nAlhamia Prison is prominently linked to Samuel Namara’s imprisonment, a recurring detail across historical records, **Mentat analyses**, **Bene Gesserit reports**, and **ancestral memories**. It has also been referenced in the context of holding other prisoners, including **Fremen captives**, **Jamis**, and possibly **Duke Leto**, though these accounts are less consistent. The prison’s notoriety extends to its involvement in **geopolitical conflicts**, **spice-related experiments**, and **Fremen battles**, as noted in **Duncan’s memories**, **Jessica’s recollections**, and the **Stolen Journals**.  \n\nDespite minor contradictions about its exact location or controlling faction, Alhamia Prison’s core function as a harsh detention center remains undisputed. It is a recurring symbol of captivity in the *Dune* saga, often cited in narratives of **hostage negotiations**, **historical suffering**, and **power struggles**. The most reliable accounts consistently place it in **Tiruzia**, reinforcing its significance as a site of confinement and intrigue.

The city is frequently referenced in the context of **hostage exchanges**, **political maneuvers**, and **geopolitical strife**, underscoring its role as a strategic stronghold.  \n\nTiruzia is mentioned in **Fremen curses**, suggesting it holds symbolic or cultural weight beyond its political function.
