帮运气时，精明人金俊武早已羞愧得低下了头。俊武同时知道，村里也不是没有人明白金富的“把戏”，只不过人家不说罢了。他清楚，象俊山和孙少安弟兄们，甚至还有田福堂和海民他们，早已在心里嘲笑上他们这家人了。 \n　　他自己一直碍于情面，也不愿给大哥大嫂揭穿其中的丑陋。自从彩娥和孙玉亭的麻糊事件发生后，他已经不愿意再看见他家出丑事扬播到前后村庄；这接二连三的丑闻，将会使他自己的儿子长大后，都没人给说媳妇！ \n　　他只好忍着不吭声。金富给他家送过来的礼物，他都让老婆客气地退回去了，这使俊文和张桂兰极不满意，好象他金俊武眼红他们发财，才这样伤他们的脸。他老婆也不明白他的做法。她看哥嫂为此不高兴，就提出请金富吃一顿饭来弥补兄弟妯娌间出现的感情裂痕。金俊武这才忍不住破口大骂：“糊脑松！那王八羔子倒是个什么人物值得咱去巴结？三天两后晌，鸡窝里就能飞出金凤凰？那小子的钱财不是从好路上来的，他瞒得了众人，瞒不了我金俊武！” \n　　几天以后，金俊武左思右想，决定找大哥谈一谈。这天在庙坪山摘完豇豆，已经黄昏了。等众人下山后，俊武就设法和俊文相跟在一起走。 \n　　两个人抽了一锅烟，俊武就开口对俊文说：“大哥，有件事我早想和你拉谈拉谈，但一直很难开口……”金俊文疑惑地问了：“什么事？你就直说！” \n　　金俊武牙齿咬了嘴唇，也不看大哥，低着头说：“我看金富要闯大祸呀！” \n　　“怎？”金俊文停住脚步，一脸的奇怪。 \n　　金俊武委婉地说：“哥，自家的娃娃自家知道。你也不想想，金富一下子就变得那么能行了？这半年多功夫，怎能赚那么钱呢？咱虽然没出过远门，但凭脑子笨想，估计外面的钱也不那么好赚……” \n　　“生意人凭的是运气！说赚就能赚大票子！”金俊文对弟弟的说法不以为然。 \n　　金俊武沉吟了一会，说：“我也是为咱们家了。咱父亲活着的时候，常指教咱们活人要活得清清白白……”“那你是说金富的钱财是在外面偷来的？抢来的？”金俊文立刻沉下脸问。 \n　　生俊武没有言传。 \n　　他态度等于肯定了金俊文的反问。这严重地损伤了俊文的尊严。他有点气愤地对弟弟说：“你不要红口白牙枉说我的娃娃！金富不是那样的人！他是我的小子，是好是坏碍不着两旁世人！”
