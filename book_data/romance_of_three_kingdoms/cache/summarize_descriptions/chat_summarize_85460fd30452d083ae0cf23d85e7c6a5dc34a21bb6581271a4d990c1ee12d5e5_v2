His reign was marked by various challenges, including internal strife and external threats. One of the key figures in his court was 黄皓, who served as an advisor to 刘禅. 黄皓 was favored by 刘禅, which allowed him to exert considerable influence over the emperor's decisions and actions within the court.\n\nDespite this favoritism, the relationship between 刘禅 and 黄皓 was complex and contentious. While 刘禅 relied on 黄皓's counsel, he also criticized 黄皓's influence at times, suggesting that there were underlying tensions in their interactions. This duality indicates that 黄皓's role was not merely that of a trusted advisor; rather, it was fraught with challenges and disagreements that could have impacted the governance of the Shu Han.\n\nIn summary, 黄皓 was a significant advisor to 刘禅, whose influence shaped many of the emperor's decisions. However, their relationship was marked by both reliance and criticism, reflecting the intricate dynamics of power and trust within the court of 刘禅.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "protected_material_text": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754899488, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
