He is known for his steadfast commitment to his beliefs, particularly regarding Einstein's theories, which have drawn significant criticism during a revolutionary event. Despite facing intense scrutiny and opposition, including threats from the Red Guards, he has neither confessed to any wrongdoing nor taken his own life, demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity.\n\nThroughout his career, 叶哲泰 has engaged in debates surrounding quantum mechanics and its philosophical implications, which have further fueled the criticism directed at him. His teachings have been met with hostility, particularly during the tumultuous period of the Cultural Revolution, when he was publicly denounced and faced severe backlash from radical factions.\n\nIn addition to his professional challenges, 叶哲泰 is also the father of 叶文洁, a character who is noted to have experienced a tragic loss, as 叶哲泰 lost his life during a violent incident. This personal tragedy adds a layer of complexity to his narrative, intertwining his professional struggles with his familial connections.\n\nOverall, 叶哲泰's life and career are marked by his unwavering dedication to his scientific principles, his role as an educator, and the personal sacrifices he has made amidst a backdrop of political turmoil and ideological conflict.\",8\r\n22,绍琳,\"绍琳 is a multifaceted character deeply intertwined with the lives of others, particularly her daughter 叶文洁 and her husband 叶哲泰. As a Red Guard, she is vocal in her criticism of 叶哲泰, whom she accuses of disseminating reactionary views through his teachings. This public disapproval is significant, especially during a revolutionary speech where she openly challenges his perspectives.\n\nIn addition to her role as a critic, 绍琳 is also a physics professor, which adds to her complexity as an intellectual figure in a tumultuous political landscape. Her professional life intersects with her personal life, as she navigates the challenges of being both a mother and a wife during a period of intense ideological conflict.\n\n绍琳's relationship with her daughter, 叶文洁, is particularly poignant. She is depicted as a guiding figure in 叶文洁's life, representing family ties and the weight of their shared history. 绍琳 appears in 叶文洁's hallucinations, symbolizing the emotional and psychological burdens stemming from their past, including the political persecution they faced. This connection is further complicated by 绍琳's own experiences of loss and resilience, as she eventually remarries a persecuted education official, highlighting her ability to adapt and survive in a challenging environment.\n\nOverall, 绍琳 embodies the struggles of a woman caught between her revolutionary ideals, her familial responsibilities, and the harsh realities of political upheaval. Her character serves as a bridge between the past and present, influencing 叶文洁's journey while also reflecting the broader societal changes occurring around them.\",5\r\n20,大学,\"The university is the setting where the events of criticism and political struggle take place, involving students and professors.\",2\r\n21,相对论,\"相对论 refers to the theory of relativity, which is a significant topic in physics that is being criticized in the context of the Cultural Revolution.\",1\r\n455,十一届三中全会,The 十一届三中全会 is a pivotal political meeting in China that led to significant changes in governance and policy.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n18,叶哲泰,红卫兵,\"During the Cultural Revolution in China, 叶哲泰 faced significant criticism and persecution from the 红卫兵 (Red Guards).

The 红卫兵 viewed these scientific ideas as reflective of bourgeois views that contradicted the revolutionary ideology they were promoting.\n\nThe Red Guards' campaign against 叶哲泰 included public denunciations and threats, which were common tactics used during this tumultuous period to suppress intellectuals and dissenting voices. Their actions were part of a broader effort to eliminate perceived enemies of the state and to enforce a strict adherence to Maoist principles.
