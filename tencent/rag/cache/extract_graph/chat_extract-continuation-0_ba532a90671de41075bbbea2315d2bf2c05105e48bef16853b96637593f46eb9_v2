His gaze went to Korba, who sat in a pose of religious reverie— listening with the soul. How could the Qizarate use this exchange? More religious mystery? Something to evoke awe? No doubt.\n“Then you'll sign the treaty in its present form?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul smiled. The issue of the oracle, by Stilgar’s judgment, had been closed. Stilgar aimed only at victory, not at discovering truth. Peace, justice and a sound coinage —these anchored Stilgar’s universe. He wanted something visible and real—a signature on a treaty.\n“PIL sign it,” Paul said.\nStilgar took up a fresh folder. “The latest communication from our field commanders in Sector Ixian speaks of agitation for a constitution.” The old Fremen glanced at Chani, who shrugged.\nlrulan, who had closed her eyes and put both hands to her forehead in mnemonic impressment, opened her eyes, studied Paul intently.\n“The Ixian Confederacy offers submission,” Stilgar said, “but their negotiators question the amount of the Imperial Tax which they—”\n“They want a legal limit to my Imperial will,” Paul said. “Who would govern me, the Landsraad or CHOAM?”\nStilgar removed from the folder a note on /nstroy paper. “One of our agents sent this memorandum from a caucus of the CHOAM minority.” He read the cipher in a flat voice: “The Throne must be stopped in its attempt at a power monopoly. We must tell the truth about the Atreides, how he maneuvers behind the triple sham of Landsraad legislation, religious sanction and bureaucratic efficiency.” He pushed the note back into the folder.\n“A constitution,” Chani murmured.\nPaul glanced at her, back to Stilgar. Thus the Jihad falters, Paul thought, but not soon enough to save me. The thought produced emotional tensions. He remembered his earliest visions of the Jinad-to-be, the terror and revulsion he’d experienced. Now, of course, he knew visions of greater terrors. He had lived with the real violence. He had seen his Fremen, charged with mystical strength, sweep all before them in the religious war. The Jihad gained a new perspective. It was finite, of course, a brief spasm when measured against eternity, but beyond lay horrors to overshadow anything in the past.\nAll in my name, Paul thought.\n“Perhaps they could be given the form of a constitution,” Chani suggested. “It needn’t be actual.”\n“Deceit js a tool of statecraft,” Irulan agreed.\n“There are limits to power, as those who put their hopes in a constitution always discover,” Paul said.\nKorba straightened from his reverent pose. “M’Lord?”\n“Yes?” And Paul thought, Here now! Here’s one who may harbor secret sympathies for an imagined rule of Law.\n“We could begin with a religious constitution,” Korba said, “something for the faithful who—”\n“No!” Paul snapped. “We will make this an Order in Council. Are you recording this, Irulan?”\n“Yes, m’Lord,” Irulan said, voice frigid with dislike for the menial role he forced upon her.\n“Constitutions become the ultimate tyranny,” Paul said. “They’re organized power on such a scale as to be overwhelming. The constitution is social power mobilized and it has no conscience. It can crush the highest and the lowest, removing all dignity and individuality. It has an unstable balance point and no limitations. |, however, have limitations. In my desire to provide an ultimate protection for my people, | forbid a constitution. Order in Council, this date, etcetera, etcetera.”\n“What of the Ixian concern about the tax, m’Lord?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul forced his attention away from the brooding, angry look on Korba’s face, said: “You’ve a proposal, Stil?”\n“We must have control of taxes, Sire.”\n“Our price to the Guild for my signature on the Tupile Treaty,” Paul said, “is the submission of the Ixian Confederacy to our tax. The Confederacy cannot trade without Guild transport. They’ll pay.”\n“Very good, m’Lord.” Stilgar produced another folder, cleared his throat. “The Qizarate’s report on Salusa Secundus. Irulan’s father has been putting his legions through landing maneuvers.”\nlrulan found something of interest in the palm of her left hand. A pulse throbbed at her neck.\n“Irulan,” Paul asked, “do you persist in arguing that your father’s one legion is nothing more than a toy?”\n“What could he do with only one legion?” she asked. She stared at him out of slitted eyes.\n“He could get himself killed,” Chani said.\nPaul nodded. “And I'd be blamed.”\n“I know a few commanders in the Jihad,” Alia said, “who'd pounce if they learned of this.”\n“But it’s only his police force!” Irulan protested.\n“Then they have no need for landing maneuvers,” Paul said. “I suggest that your next little note to your father\ncontain a frank and direct discussion of my views about his delicate position.”\nShe lowered her gaze. “Yes, m’Lord. | hope that will be the end of it. My father would make a good martyr.”\n“Mmmmmmm,” Paul said. “My sister wouldn’t send a message to those commanders she mentioned unless | ordered it.”\n“An attack on my father carries dangers other than the obvious military ones,” Irulan said. “People are beginning to look back on his reign with a certain nostalgia.”\n“You'll go too far one day,” Chani said in her deadly serious Fremen voice.\n“Enough!” Paul ordered.\nHe weighed Irulan’s revelation about public nostalgia—ah, now! that’d carried a note of truth. Once more, Irulan had proved her worth.\n“The Bene Gesserit send a formal supplication,” Stilgar said, presenting another folder. “They wish to consult you about the preservation of your bloodline.”\nChani glanced sideways at the folder as though it contained a deadly device.\n“Send the Sisterhood the usual excuses,” Paul said.\n“Must we?” Irulan demanded.\n“Perhaps... this is the time to discuss it,” Chani said.\nPaul shook his head sharply. They couldn’t know that this was part of the price he had not yet decided to pay.\nBut Chani wasn’t to be stopped. “I have been to the prayer wall of Sietch Tabr where | was born,” she said. “I have submitted to doctors. | have knelt in the desert and sent my thoughts into the depths where dwells Shai-hulud. Yet”—she shrugged—“nothing avails.”\nScience and superstition, all have failed her, Paul thought. Do I fail her, too, by not telling her what bearing an heir to House Atreides will precipitate? He looked up to find an expression of pity in Alia’s eyes. The idea of pity from his sister repelled him. Had she, too, seen that terrifying future?\n“My Lord must know the dangers to his realm when he has no heir,” Irulan said, using her Bene Gesserit powers of voice with an oily persuasiveness. “These things are naturally difficult to discuss, but they must be brought into the open. An Emperor is more than a man. His figure leads the realm. Should he die without an heir, civil strife must follow. As you love your people, you cannot leave them thus?”\nPaul pushed himself away from the table, strode to the balcony windows. A wind was flattening the smoke of the city’s fires out there. The sky presented a darkening silver- blue softened by the evening fall of dust from the Shield Wall. He stared southward at the escarpment which protected his northern lands from the coriolis wind, and he wondered why his own peace of mind could find no such shield.\nThe Council sat silently waiting behind him, aware of how close to rage he was.\nPaul sensed time rushing upon him. He tried to force himself into a tranquility of many balances where he might Shape a new future.\nDisengage... disengage... disengage, he thought. What would happen if he took Chani, just picked up and left with her, sought sanctuary on Tupile? His name would remain behind. The Jihad would find new and more terrible centers upon which to turn. He’d be blamed for that, too. He felt suddenly fearful that in reaching for any new thing he might let fall what was most precious, that even the slightest noise from him might send the universe crashing back, receding until he never could recapture any piece of it.\nBelow him, the square had become the setting for a band of pilgrims in the green and white of the hajj. They wended their way like a disjointed snake behind a striding Arrakeen guide. They reminded Paul that his reception hall would be packed with supplicants by now. Pilgrims! Their exercise in\nhomelessness had become a disgusting source of wealth for his Imperium. The hajj filled the spoace-ways with religious tramps. They came and they came and they came.\nHow did I set this in motion? he asked himself.\nIt had, of course, set itself in motion. It was in the genes which might labor for centuries to achieve this brief spasm.\nDriven by that deepest religious instinct, the people came, seeking their resurrection. The pilgrimage ended here —“Arrakis, the place of rebirth, the place to die.”\nSnide old Fremen said he wanted the pilgrims for their water.\nWhat was it the pilgrims really sought? Paul wondered. They said they came to a holy place. But they must know the universe contained no Eden-source, no Tupile for the soul. They called Arrakis the place of the unknown where all mysteries were explained. This was a link between their universe and the next. And the frightening thing was that they appeared to go away Satisfied.\nWhat do they find here? Paul asked himself.\nOften in their religious ecstasy, they filled the streets with screeching like some odd aviary. In fact, the Fremen called them “passage birds.” And the few who died here were “winged souls.”\nWith a sigh, Paul thought how each new planet his legions subjugated opened new sources of pilgrims. They came out of gratitude for “the peace of Muad’Dib.”\nEverywhere there is peace, Paul thought. Everywhere... except in the heart of Muad’Dib.\nHe felt that some element of himself lay immersed in frosty hoar-darkness without end. His prescient power had tampered with the image of the universe held by all mankind. He had shaken the safe cosmos and replaced security with his Jihad. He had out-fought and out-thought and out-predicted the universe of men, but a certainty filled him that this universe still eluded him.\nThis planet beneath him which he had commanded be remade from desert into a water-rich paradise, it was alive. It had a pulse as dynamic as that of any human. It fought him, resisted, slipped away from his commands...\nA hand crept into Paul’s. He looked down to see Chani peering up at him, concern in her eyes. Those eyes drank him, and she whispered: “Please, love, do not battle with your ruh-self.” An outpouring of emotion swept upward from her hand, buoyed him.\n“Sihaya,” he whispered.\n“We must go to the desert soon,” she said in a low voice.\nHe squeezed her hand, released it, returned to the table where he remained standing.\nChani took her seat.\nlrulan stared at the papers in front of Stilgar, her mouth a tight line.\n“I\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>Irulan is a careful and conscious individual, often involved in political and religious discussions, and has a strained relationship with Paul Atreides.
