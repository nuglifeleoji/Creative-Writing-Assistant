Built in a notch of the Shield Wall, it is a bustling hub of political, religious, and ceremonial activity, often visited by Leto’s royal entourage. The city is associated with significant events, including the Decennial Festival, where public rituals like Siaynoq take place in its plaza—a site marked by religious fervor and occasional violence.  \n\nBeneath Onn lies a secret, windowless room where a woman works in secrecy, and deep underground regions house structures such as ramps and service burrows used for rebel meetings. The city is a center of rebellion, known for its mechanical smells and as a base for dissident activities. It is also near the Forbidden Forest and features orchards and gardens that sustain its population.  \n\nOnn’s landscape is cluttered with houses, forests, and remnants of the ancient city of Arrakeen, reflecting Leto’s controlled environment. It is home to the Fish Speakers' School, where Siona studies, and is a destination for off-world visitors. The city is linked to pivotal moments, such as Duncan Idaho’s arrival after his resurrection, Hwi Noree’s summons by Leto, and the Tleilaxu’s planned attack on the God Emperor.  \n\nDespite its ceremonial importance, Onn is also a place of tension—mentioned in the context of Idaho’s \"night of alarms\" and as a potential trigger for Leto’s transformation into the Worm. While Siona once considered returning to Onn, the royal entourage often diverts to the Citadel instead. The city’s peculiar design, centered around its plaza for public viewing, underscores its role as a stage for Leto’s rule and the empire’s unfolding drama.  \n\nPronounced with a nasal inflection, Onn remains a key location in the empire’s geography, blending grandeur, secrecy, and rebellion beneath its festival-driven facade.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251824, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 428, "prompt_tokens": 846, "total_tokens": 1274, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 782}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
