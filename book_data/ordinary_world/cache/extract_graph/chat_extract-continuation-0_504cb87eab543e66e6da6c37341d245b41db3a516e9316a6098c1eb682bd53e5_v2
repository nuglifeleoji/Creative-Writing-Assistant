，这事一旦公开处理，红梅的一生就要被彻底毁灭了。他无法目睹活人的这种惨状。在他看来，一个人哪怕让汽车压得当场断气，也比背着个贼名活一辈子强。尤其对一个女人来说，这简直惨不可言！ \n　　他心急火燎地走在跛女子旁边。夜晚料峭的寒风吹拂着他烫热的脸颊。这时候，他觉得二门市后面关的不是郝红梅，而是他的妹妹兰香。他要奋不顾身地挽救她，就象他冒着生命危险救下了他身边走着的这个跛女子。他似乎看见红梅也象侯玉英一样，两只手揪着两把丛草，洪水已经淹没了半身，她绝望地呼喊着“救命！救命！” \n　　“你坚持一会！我来了……”他在心里向她喊叫说。 \n　　跛女子走到太慢了！他真想一把扯住她的袖口，飞快地向二门市跑去。可又想也不能怨侯玉英走得慢——她腿不好！ \n　　路灯如同一些诡秘的眼睛，窥视着夜行的人。风摇动着街道两边的门环，发出“咣当咣当”的声响。冬夜中的原西城充满清冷和凄凉。但是，此刻，孙少平心中温热地想起，两年前，在这样寒冷的日子里，他总是和郝红梅在中学的饭场上不期而遇。那时候，两个穿戴破烂的乡下娃，曾多么难为情地躲避众人的嘲笑，偷偷地取回自己的两个黑面馍……一股辛辣的味道顿时涌上了他的咽喉与鼻管，使得两大滴热泪迅疾地冲出眼窝，洒落在脚下的石板街上……当孙少平跟着侯玉英来到二门市她父亲的办公室时，侯生才惊讶地问他们：“你们学校的领导哩？” \n　　孙少平立刻说：“候叔叔！这事不要经领导了，由我来处理！” \n　　侯生才吃惊地看着这个严峻的青年，不知他怎处理这事呀？会不会先跑到隔壁，把这个耍弄过他的女学生捶一顿？少平马上接着说：“叔叔，我请求你的是，除过现在的几个人，这事决不能再让任何一个人知道。而且永远不能让人知道。你要对我起誓！我们村的金光明，你要把这话给他说到，因为你是他的领导，他会听你说的。 \n　　“你要想想，郝红梅是我和你们家玉英的同学。她因为家穷，给同学送不起礼物，才犯了这个错误。你应该相信，她是一个好人。谁也不能伤害她！如果谁要是伤害了她，我就不会原谅，迟早会向伤害她的人算帐的！” \n　　“你喝水！”侯主任一直震惊地听这个青年说话。他万万没有想到，这后生竟然这样来“处理”这件事。尽管他没听说过“起誓”这两个字——但他明白这是叫他赌�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>郝红梅<|>PERSON<|>郝红梅 is
