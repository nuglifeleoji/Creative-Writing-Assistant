His relationship with the geographical location of 泸水 is pivotal in understanding his actions and decisions throughout his military campaigns.\n\nAfter his capture, 孟获 was taken to 泸水, which highlights the importance of this location in the context of his imprisonment. This movement underscores the strategic significance of 泸水 as a geographical point during the conflicts of the era. Following his release by the renowned strategist 孔明, 孟获 utilized the strategic advantages offered by 泸水 to regroup and gather his forces. This indicates that the location was not only a site of confinement but also a crucial area for military strategy and planning.\n\nThe geographical significance of 泸水 played a vital role in shaping 孟获's military decisions. His ability to leverage the terrain and resources of 泸水 allowed him to enhance his military capabilities and coordinate his forces effectively.
