During the ceremony, Fish Speaker trainees distribute spice-laced wafers to the crowd, which are consumed in unison. The ritual involves declarations of loyalty, chanting (\"\"We share!\"\"), and the display of Paul Muad'Dib's crysknife as a holy relic. The event underscores Leto's connection to the spice melange and the cultural legacy of the Atreides. It is a powerful display of the Fish Speakers' devotion and Leto's control over his followers' emotions and beliefs. The Great Sharing also serves as a test for figures like Duncan Idaho, who must publicly affirm their allegiance to the God Emperor.\"\"\",3\n1490,TUONO VILLAGE,\"**Tuono Village** is a Fremen settlement that serves as the final location for Leto's wedding, embodying a museum-like preservation of Fremen culture. The village also functions as the temporary residence for a delegation that includes Duncan Idaho and Siona, highlighting its significance as both a cultural landmark and a key setting for political and social gatherings. By combining its role as a ceremonial site with its practical use as lodging for important figures, Tuono Village emerges as a central hub where tradition and contemporary events intersect.\",6\n1315,FISH SPEAKERS,\"The **Fish Speakers** are an all-female military and religious order fiercely loyal to the God Emperor **Leto II**, serving as his elite guard, enforcers, and ceremonial protectors. Originally designed as a non-aggressive force to avoid the pitfalls of male-dominated armies, they play a central role in maintaining Leto’s rule, enforcing his will, and upholding the **Golden Path**. Their duties span military, political, and religious domains, including security, ritual oversight (such as the **Siaynoq** and **Great Sharing** ceremonies), and participation in Leto’s breeding program.  \n\nClad in distinctive uniforms—green robes for trainees and white for senior members—they symbolize communal unity under Leto’s empire. Their structure is cyclical and ritualistic, with events like the **Royal Festival** held every decade. The Fish Speakers also suppress threats, such as **Bene Tleilax** assassination attempts, and enforce Leto’s philosophy of taming male aggression through education and domestication.  \n\nHistorically tied to the **Tyrant**, they later transitioned allegiance to **Duncan Idaho** and, in some accounts, evolved into the autocratic **Honored Matres**. While primarily female, modern delegations occasionally include men. Their influence waned post-Leto, with remnants squandering spice reserves or aligning with factions like the **Ixians**, though their legacy persists in Rakian history.  \n\nDespite contradictions—such as their perceived decline versus enduring power—the Fish Speakers remain a defining force in Leto’s empire, blending militaristic discipline with religious devotion to sustain his vision for humanity.\",43\n1322,DECENNIAL FESTIVAL,\"The **Decennial Festival** is a recurring imperial celebration held under the rule of the God Emperor Leto II. Primarily taking place on **Arrakis**, it serves as a major political and social gathering where key reports are submitted to **Lord Leto**, reinforcing his governance. The event is attended by representatives of the **Fish Speakers**, Leto's elite military and administrative force, highlighting its importance in maintaining imperial authority.  \n\nWhile the festival is most prominently associated with **Arrakis**, it has also been held in **Onn**, where Leto attended before returning to the **Citadel**, suggesting it may rotate locations or have regional iterations. Despite minor discrepancies in location, the core purpose remains consistent: the Decennial Festival is a significant occasion for imperial administration, strategic discourse, and ceremonial observance under Leto's reign. The event underscores the God Emperor's centralized power while facilitating cohesion among his key supporters.  \n\nIn summary, the **Decennial Festival** is a pivotal, decade-spanning event that reinforces Leto II's rule, serving as both a political forum and a symbolic reaffirmation of his empire's unity. Whether on Arrakis or in Onn, its function as a gathering for reports, strategy, and imperial pageantry remains unchanged.\",2\n1387,SIYNOQ,\"A sacred ritual and word reserved for the Fish Speakers, involving honor, remembrance, and the summoning to prayer.\"\"\",1\n1405,IMPERIAL ORNITHOPTER,\"Official aircraft of the Empire used to transport Idaho and Siona\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3244,LETO,GREAT SHARING,\"Leto orchestrates the Great Sharing as a ritual to reinforce his divine authority and communal bonds among his followers.
