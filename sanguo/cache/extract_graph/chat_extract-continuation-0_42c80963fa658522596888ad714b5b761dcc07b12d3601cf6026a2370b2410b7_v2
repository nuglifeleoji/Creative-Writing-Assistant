朱儁引兵围住阳城攻打，一面差人打探皇甫嵩消息。探子回报，具说：“皇甫嵩大获胜捷，朝廷以董卓屡败，命嵩代之。嵩到时，张角已死；张梁统其众，与我军相拒，被皇甫嵩连胜七阵，斩张梁于曲阳。发张角之棺，戮尸枭首，送往京师。余众俱降。朝廷加皇甫嵩为车骑将军，领冀州牧。皇甫嵩又表奏卢植有功无罪，朝廷复卢植原官。曹操亦以有功，除济南相，即日将班师赴任。”朱儁听说，催促军马，悉力攻打阳城。贼势危急，贼将严政刺杀张宝，献首投降。朱儁遂平数郡，上表献捷。时又黄巾余党三人：赵弘、韩忠、孙仲，聚众数万，望风烧劫，称与张角报仇。朝廷命朱儁即以得胜之师讨之。儁奉诏，率军前进。时贼据宛城，儁引兵攻之，赵弘遣韩忠出战。儁遣玄德、关、张攻城西南角。韩忠尽率精锐之众，来西南角抵敌。朱儁自纵铁骑二千，径取东北角。贼恐失城，急弃西南面回。玄德从背后掩杀，贼众大败，奔入宛城。朱儁分兵四面围定。城中断粮，韩忠使人出城投降。儁不许。玄德曰：“昔高祖之得天下，盖为能招降纳顺；公何拒韩忠耶？”儁曰：“彼一时，此一时也。昔秦项之际，天下大乱，民无定主，故招降赏附，以劝来耳。今海内一统，惟黄巾造反；若容其降，无以劝善。使贼得利恣意劫掠，失利便投降：此长寇之志，非良策也。”玄德曰：“不容寇降是矣。今四面围如铁桶，贼乞降不得，必然死战。万人一心，尚不可当，况城中有数万死命之人乎？不若撤去东南，独攻西北。贼必弃城而走，无心恋战，可即擒也。”儁然之，随撤东南二面军马，一齐攻打西北。韩忠果引军弃城而奔。儁与玄德、关、张率三军掩杀，射死韩忠，余皆四散奔走。正追赶间，赵弘、孙仲引贼众到，与儁交战。儁见弘势大，引军暂退。弘乘势复夺宛城。儁离十里下寨。方欲攻打，忽见正东一彪人马到来。为首一将，生得广额阔面，虎体熊腰；吴郡富春人也，姓孙，名坚，字文台，乃孙武子之后。年十七岁时，与父至钱塘，见海贼十余人，劫取商人财物，于岸上分赃。坚谓父曰：“此贼可擒也。”遂奋力提刀上岸，扬声\n######################\nOutput:",
