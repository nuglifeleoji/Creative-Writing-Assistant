来一元化的革命委员会演变成了党政分家的局面。县以上重建了人大，和党委、政府一起被俗称为“三套班子”。举世闻名的人民公社先后被乡政府所取代。“革命”留下的许多遗产正逐渐在生活中销声匿迹。 \n　　双水村在外观上看不出有多大变化。山还是原来的山，人还是原来的人，东拉河依旧唱着它不倦的歌谣淌过这个平凡的村庄。 \n　　但是，双水村的确不是原来的双水村了，它的变化有的能感觉到，也有感觉不到的。一个最显著的变化是，大部分人再不为吃饭而熬煎了。仅此一点，就不能不使人百感交集地喊道：天啊…… \n　　如今，对大部分人家来说，玉米面馍已经成了家常便饭。有些门道的人家，不仅白面，就是大米也不再是什么稀罕之物。个别农户的存粮，据本村一些观察家估计，远远超过了旧社会老地主金光亮他爸。金家湾前二队长金俊武就是其中之一。 \n　　需要提醒诸位的是，这一切变化都是在短短一两年中发生的；要知道，我们曾几十年鸣雷击鼓搞农业，也没有能解决农民的吃饭问题……可是，随之也出现了一些令人不安的情况。最突出的问题是大部分人缺钱花。 \n　　说实话，眼下人们对新政策是否久长，心中还存在着疑问。那么，趁现在手脚放活之时，赶快狠收几年粮食！为了多打粮，大部分农民都对土地实行了掠夺式耕种。谁也不再给土地施有机肥料。过去，为了抢担公社机关和县城的公共厕所里的茅粪，常常酿成各地农民的武斗。现在，城里大小厕所的粪便都无人问津，公家不得不掏钱雇人清理。粮食要高产，当然上化肥最足劲！ \n　　可买化肥需要钱——一年两料庄稼，得要多少化肥呀！当然，除过买化肥，还有许多用钱之处。一家一户耕作，坏了农具要自己添置。牲畜不蹬劲需要换个好使役的，也需二三百元。另外，市场一开放，洪水一样泛滥的各种东西也若人眼谗。旁的不说，石圪节街上一排排花花绿绿的时髦衣裳，儿女媳妇们赶集上会想买一身，你不给钱行吗？钱啊！成了庄稼人经常挂在嘴上的一个字眼。为了买化肥，为了买牲畜农具，为了给儿女们买一两身时新衣裳，为了象邻居一样添置一件新时代的小玩艺，庄稼人不得不又把囤里积攒下的粮食，扛到石圪节的自由市场上去卖掉……俗话说，这山望见那山高。的确，在农村，人们在刚吃饱饭之后，就又有点不满足了。老百姓纷纷寻思，怎样才能把日子过得红火一些？这心理极其正常——追求更好的生活\n######################\nOutput:",
