Notably, the vessel has faced significant challenges during its operations.\n\nIn one instance, the \"\"无限边疆号\"\" was attacked by a nuclear fireball, which resulted in the complete melting of its hull. This catastrophic event highlights the vulnerabilities of even advanced military ships in the face of powerful weaponry. Additionally, the warship suffered a high-speed impact from a water droplet, which caused two circular holes to form in its structure. This incident led to a massive explosion, further emphasizing the dangers that the \"\"无限边疆号\"\" encountered during its missions.\n\nOverall, the \"\"无限边疆号\"\" is depicted as a formidable yet ultimately vulnerable military asset, having faced devastating attacks that compromised its integrity and operational capacity.\",4\r\n733,远方号,\"The \"\"远方号\"\" is a military vessel, specifically classified as a stellar-class warship, that is actively engaged in a conflict.
