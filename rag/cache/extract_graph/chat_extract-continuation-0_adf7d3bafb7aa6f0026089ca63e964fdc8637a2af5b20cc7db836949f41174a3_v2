Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.”\n“One moment, please,” Kynes said. “With your permission, Sire, | must check the security of your Suits.”\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: “I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours...\nmy Lord. I’m well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care.”\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet...to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?\nThe thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. “We're in your hands,” the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe, Saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where he was. “And, if you’d be so kind,” the Duke said, “I’d appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.”\n“Certainly,” Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals, speaking as he examined the suit. “It’s basically a micro-sandwich—a high- efficiency filter and heat-exchange system.” He adjusted the shoulder seals. “The skin-contact layer’s porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body...near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers...” Kynes tightened the chest fit. “... include heat-exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt’s reclaimed.”\nThe Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: “Most interesting.”\n“Breathe deeply,” Kynes said.\nThe Duke obeyed.\nKynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. “Motions of the body, especially breathing,” he said, “and some osmotic action provide the pumping\nforce.” He loosened the chest fit slightly. “Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck.”\nThe Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube. “Efficient and convenient,” he said. “Good engineering.”\nKynes knelt, examined the leg seals. “Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads,” he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned flap there. “In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won’t lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day—even if you’re caught in the Great Erg.”\n“A thimbleful a day,” the Duke said.\nKynes pressed a finger against the suit’s forehead pad, said: “This may rub a little. If it irritates you, please tell me. | could slit-patch it a bit tighter.”\n“My thanks,” the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now—tighter and less irritating.\nKynes turned to Paul. “Now, let’s have a look at you, lad.”\nA good man but he'll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.\nPaul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting\nthe adhesion tabs under Gurney’s inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.\nKynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. “You’ve worn a stillSuit before?” he asked.\n“This is the first time.”\n“Then someone adjusted it for you?”\n“No.”\n“Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do that?”\n“It...seemed the right way.”\n“That it most certainly is.”\nAnd Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: “He shall know your ways as though born to them.”\n“We waste time,” the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting ‘thopter, led the way, accepting the guard’s salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his Safety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard.\nKynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft—soft luxury of gray- green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive.\nSo soft! he thought.\n“All secure, Sire,” Halleck said.\nLeto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip —once, twice. They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.\n“Southeast over the Shield Wall,” Kynes said. “That’s where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment.”\n“Right.”\nThe Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast.\n“The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication,” the Duke said.\n“Someday | may show you a sietch factory,” Kynes said.\n“I would find that interesting,” the Duke said. “l note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.”\n“Inferior copies,” Kynes said. “Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit.”\n“And it'll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?”\n“Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major water loss is through the palms of your hands,” Kynes said. “You can wear suit gloves if you’re not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It inhibits perspiration.”\nThe Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield Wall—chasms of tortured\nrock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black lines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space and left it where it Smashed.\nThey crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into the basin—a dry delta outlined against darker rock.\nKynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the waist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheaths and the sheaths appeared well worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.\n“When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you say we observed the rules?” Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to their course.\n“The Harkonnens left; you came,” Kynes said.\n“And is everything as it should be?” Leto asked.\nMomentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes’ jaw. “As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, | am a direct subject of the Imperium...my Lord.”\nThe Duke smiled grimly. “But we both know the realities.”\n“I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.”\n“Indeed? And what is your work?”\nIn the brief silence, Paul thought: He’s pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren landscape.\nKynes spoke stiffly: “You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.”\n“Of course.”\n“It is mostly dry land biology and botany...some geological work—core drilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire planet.”\n“Do you also investigate the spice?”\nKynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man’s cheek. “A curious question, my Lord.”\n“Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those of the Harkonnens. | don’t care if you study the spice as long as | share what you discover.” He glanced at the planetologist. “The Harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice, didn’t they?”\nKynes stared back without answering.\n“You may speak plainly,” the Duke said, “without fear for your skin.”\n“The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,” Kynes muttered. And he thought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?\nThe Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. “I detect a sour note in your voice, sir. We’ve waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we’re different from the Harkonnens?”\n“I’ve seen the propaganda you’ve flooded into sietch and village,” Kynes said. “‘Love the good Duke!’ Your corps of—”\n“Here now!” Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward.\nPaul put a hand on Halleck’s arm.\n“Gurney!” the Duke said. He glanced back. “This man’s been long under the Harkonnens.”\nHalleck sat back. “Ayah.”\n“Your man Hawat’s subtle,” Kynes said, “but his object’s plain enough.”\n“Will you open those bases to us, then?” the Duke asked.\nKynes spoke curtly: “They’re His Majesty’s property.”\n“They're not being used.”\n“They could be used.”\n“Does His Majesty concur?”\nKynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. “Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!”\nHe didn’t answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: “How is a planet to become an Eden without money?”\n“What is money,” Kynes asked, “if it won’t buy the services you need?”\nAh, now! the Duke thought. And he said: “We'll discuss this another time. Right now, I believe we're coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do | hold the Same course?”\n“The same course,” Kynes muttered.\nPaul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged Shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Paul couldn’t be sure.\n“Are there any plants down there?” Paul asked.\n“Some,” Kynes said. “This latitude’s life-zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers—adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HALLECK<|>PERSON<|>Halleck is a minstrel-warrior and a loyal companion to the Duke, often providing security and advice.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE<|>PERSON<|>The Duke is a noble leader who has recently taken control of Arrakis, showing a mix of authority and diplomacy in his interactions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYNES<|>PERSON<|>Kynes is a planetologist and Judge of the Change, deeply knowledgeable about Arrakis and its environment, with a cautious yet insightful demeanor.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is the Duke's son, showing curiosity and adaptability, especially in unfamiliar situations like wearing a stillsuit for the first time.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>PERSON<|>The Fremen are the native inhabitants of Arrakis, known for their survival skills and intimate knowledge of the desert.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>PERSON<|>The Harkonnens are the previous rulers of Arrakis, known for their harsh and oppressive methods.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPERIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Imperium is the overarching governing body of the universe, with the Emperor at its head, influencing planetary affairs.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIELD WALL<|>GEO<|>The Shield Wall is a rugged and broken landscape on Arrakis, serving as a natural barrier and landmark.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT ERG<|>GEO<|>The Great Erg is a vast desert region on Arrakis, known for its extreme conditions and the challenge it poses to survival.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet, the setting of the story, rich in spice and central to political and economic power struggles.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH FACTORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sietch factory is a manufacturing facility operated by the Fremen, producing high-quality stillsuits and other survival gear.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT<|>EVENT<|>The change of government refers to the transition of power from the Harkonnens to the Duke on Arrakis, a significant political shift.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>HALLECK<|>The Duke and Halleck share a close relationship, with Halleck serving as a trusted advisor and protector.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>KYNES<|>The Duke seeks to establish trust with Kynes, recognizing his value as a planetologist and potential ally.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>PAUL<|>The Duke is Paul's father, showing concern and guidance for his son's development and safety.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>KYNES<|>Paul interacts with Kynes, who is intrigued by Paul's natural aptitude for wearing a stillsuit.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>FREMEN<|>Kynes has a deep connection with the Fremen, understanding their ways and sharing their knowledge of Arrakis.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>HARKONNENS<|>The Duke has replaced the Harkonnens as ruler of Arrakis, marking a significant political change.<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>IMPERIUM<|>Kynes is a direct subject of the Imperium, serving as a Planetologist and Judge of the Change.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>IMPERIUM<|>The Duke's rule on Arrakis is under the broader authority of the Imperium, with tensions over control and resources.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>HALLECK<|>Paul and Halleck share a bond, with Halleck acting as a mentor and protector to Paul.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>SHIELD WALL<|>Kynes is familiar with the Shield Wall, using it as a reference point for navigation and study.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE<|>ARRIS<|>The Duke has taken control of Arrakis, making it his fief and seeking to understand its resources and people.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>ARRIS<|>Kynes is deeply connected to Arrakis, studying its ecology and advising its rulers on its potential.<|>8\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
