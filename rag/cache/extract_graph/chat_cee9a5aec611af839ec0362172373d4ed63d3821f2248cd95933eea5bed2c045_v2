He’s welcome to them.”\nHere is another book dedicated to Bev, friend, wife, dependable helper and the person who gave this one its title. The dedication is posthumous and the words below, written the morning after she died, should tell you something of her inspiration.\nO ne of the best things | can say about Bev is there was nothing in our life together | need forget, not even the graceful moment of her death. She gave me then the ultimate gift of her love, a peaceful passing she had spoken of without fear or tears, allaying thereby my own fears. What greater gift is there than to demonstrate you need not fear death?\nThe formal obituary would read: Beverly Ann Stuart Forbes Herbert, born October 20, 1926, Seattle, Washington; died 5:05 pm. February 7, 1984, at Kawaloa, Maui. | know that is as much formality as she would tolerate. She made me promise there would be no conventional funeral “with a preacher’s sermon and my body on display.” As she said: “l will not be in that body then but it deserves more dignity than such a display provides.”\nShe insisted | go no further than to have her cremated and scatter her ashes at her beloved Kawaloa “where | have felt so much peace and love.” The only ceremony—friends and loved ones to watch the scattering of her ashes during the singing of “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”\nShe knew there would be tears then as there are tears while | write these words but in her last days she often spoke of tears as futile. She recognized tears as part of our animal origins. The dog howls at the loss of its master.\nAnother part of human awareness dominated her life: Spirit. Not in any mawkish religious sense nor in anything\nmost Spiritualists would associate with the word. To Bev, it was the light shining from awareness onto everything she encountered. Because of this, | can say despite my grief and even within grief that joy fills my spirit because of the love she gave and continues to give me. Nothing in the sadness at her death is too high a price to pay for the love we shared.\nHer choice of a song to sing at the scattering of her ashes went to what we often said to each other—that she was my bridge and | was hers. That epitomizes our married life.\nWe began that sharing with a ceremony before a minister in Seattle on June 20, 1946. Our honeymoon was spent on a firewatch lookout atop Kelley Butte in Snoqualmie National Forest. Our quarters were twelve feet square with a cupola above only six feet square and most of that filled by the firefinder with which we located any smoke we saw.\nIn cramped quarters with a spring-powered Victrola and two portable typewriters taking up considerable space on the one table, we pretty well set the pattern of our life together: work to support music, writing and the other joys living provides.\nNone of this is to say we experienced constant euphoria. Far from it. We had moments of boredom, fears, and pains. But there was always time for laughter. Even at the end, Bev still could smile to tell me | had positioned her correctly on her pillows, that | had eased the aching of her back with a gentle massage and the other things necessary because she could no longer do them for herself.\nIn her final days, she did not want anyone but me to touch her. But our married life had created such a bond of love and trust she often said the things | did for her were as though she did them. Though | had to provide the most intimate care, the care you would give an infant, she did not feel offended nor that her dignity had been assaulted. When | picked her up in my arms to make her more comfortable or bathe her, Bev’s arms always went around my shoulders\nand her face nestled as it often had in the hollow of my neck.\nIt is difficult to convey the joy of those moments but | assure you it was there. Joy of the spirit. Joy of life even at death. Her hand was in mine when she died and the attending doctor, tears in his eyes, said the thing | and many others had said of her.\n“She had grace.”\nMany of those who saw that grace did not understand. | remember when we entered the hospital in the pre-dawn hours for the birth of our first son. We were laughing. Attendants looked at us with disapproval. Birth is painful and dangerous. Women die giving birth. Why are these people laughing?\nWe were laughing because the prospect of new life that was part of both of us filled us with such happiness. We were laughing because the birth was about to occur ina hospital built on the site of the hospital where Bev was born. What a marvelous continuity!\nOur laughter was infectious and soon others we met on the way to the delivery room were smiling. Disapproval became approval. Laughter was her grace note in moments of stress.\nHers was also the laughter of the constantly new. Everything she encountered had something new in it to excite her senses. There was a naivete about Bev that was, in its own way, a form of sophistication. She wanted to find what was good in everything and everyone. As a result, she brought out that response in others.\n“Revenge is for children,” she said. “Only people who are basically immature want it.”\nShe was known to call people who had offended her and plead with them to put away destructive feelings. “Let us be friends.” The source of none of the condolences that poured in after her death surprised me.\nIt was typical of her that she wanted me to call the radiologist whose treatment in 1974 was the proximate cause of her death and thank him “for giving me these ten beautiful years. Make sure he understands | know he did his best for me when I was dying of cancer. He took the state of the art to its limits and | want him to know my appreciation.”\nIs it any wonder that | look back on our years together with a happiness transcending anything words can describe? Is it any wonder I do not want or need to forget one moment of it? Most others merely touched her life at the periphery. | shared it in the most intimate ways and everything she did strengthened me. It would not have been possible for me to do what necessity demanded of me during the final ten years of her life, strengthening her in return, had she not given of herself in the preceding years, holding back nothing. | consider that to be my great good fortune and most miraculous privilege.\nFrank Herbert Port Townsend, WA April 6, 1984\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nFrank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.\nIn 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories. But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune.
