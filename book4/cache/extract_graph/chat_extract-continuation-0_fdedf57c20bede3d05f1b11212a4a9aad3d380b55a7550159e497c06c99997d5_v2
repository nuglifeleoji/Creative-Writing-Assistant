\n　　少平于是在书架上挑了一本《牛虻》——他很早就听晓霞介绍过这本书。 \n　　就这样，他背着自己的铺盖卷，手里提着那只烂黄提包，怀里揣着《牛虻》，来到了北关阳沟大队书记家。书记的老婆是个精明麻利人，看来最少能主半个家事。她引着少平，把他送到匠工们住的敞子窑里，并且又把站场监工的亲戚叫来，把他交待给了这位工头。 \n　　这敞口子窑铺了一地麦秸；麦秸上一摆溜丢着十七八个铺盖卷，地方几乎占满了。少平只好把自己的那点行李放在窑口最边上的地方。 \n　　吃过中午饭，少平就上了工。 \n　　他当然干最重的活——从沟道里的打石场往半山坡箍窑的地方背石头。 \n　　背着一百多斤的大石块，从那道陡坡爬上去，人简直连腰也直不起来，劳动强度如同使苦役的牛马一般。 \n　　少平尽管没有受过这样的苦，但他咬着牙不使自己比别人落后。他知道，对于一个揽工汉来说，上工的头三天是最重要的。如果开头几天不行，主家就会把你立即辞退——东关大桥头有的是小工！ \n　　每当背着石块爬坡的时候，他的意识就处于半麻痹状态。沉重的石头几乎要把他挤压到土地里去。汗水象小溪一样在脸上纵横漫流，而他却腾不出手去揩一把；眼睛被汗水腌得火辣辣地疼，一路上只能半睁半闭。两条打颤的腿如同筛糠，随时都有倒下的危险。这时候，世界上什么东西都不存在了，思维只集中在一点上：向前走，把石头背到箍窑的地方——那里对他来说，每一次都几乎是一个不可企及的伟大目标！ \n　　三天下来，他的脊背就被压烂了。他无法目睹自己脊背上的惨状，只感到象带刺的葛针条刷过一般。两只手随即也肿胀起来，肉皮被石头磨得象一层透明的纸，连毛细血管都能看得见。这样的手放在新石茬上，就象放在刀刃上！第三天晚上他睡下的时候，整个身体象火烧着一般灼疼。他在睡梦中渴望一种冰凉的东西扑灭他身上的火焰。他梦见下雨了，雨点滴嗒在烫热的脸庞上……一阵惊喜使他从睡梦中醒了过来。真奇怪！他感觉自己脸上真有几滴湿淋淋的东西。下雨了？可他睡在窑里，雨怎么可能滴在脸上呢？ \n　　他睁大眼，发现他旁边的一个石匠工光着屁股往被窝里钻。他感到一阵发呕，赶忙用被子揩了揩�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少平<|>PERSON<|>少平 is a character who is working hard
