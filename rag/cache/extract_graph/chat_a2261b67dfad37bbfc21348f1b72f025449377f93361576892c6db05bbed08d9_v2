But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre- Spice pocket somewhere underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.\nHis hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.\nA thought spread across his mind—clear, distinct: The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization— agriculture.\nAnd he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here without water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didn’t. They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the impersonal hands of his planet.\nThe Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought. We don’t die easily. | should be dead now...! will be dead soon...but I can’t stop being an ecologist.\n“The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences.”\nThe voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was dead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before him—his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.\n“Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son,” his father said. “You should’ve known the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke.”\nI’m delirious, Kynes thought.\nThe voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through sand, turning to look in that direction—nothing except a curving stretch of dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.\n“The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for life,” his father said. And the voice came now from his left, from behind him.\nWhy does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn’t he want me to see him?\n“Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life,” his father said. “Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It binds more energy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to organism.”\nWhy does he keep harping on the same subject? Kynes asked himself. / knew that before | was ten.\nDesert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began to circle over him. Kynes Saw a Shadow pass near his hand, forced his head farther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch on silver-blue sky—distant flecks of soot floating above him.\n“We are generalists,” his father said. “You can’t draw neat lines around planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit science.”\nWhat’s he trying to tell me? Kynes wondered. /s there some consequence | failed to see?\nHis cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock odor beneath the pre- spice gasses. From some corner of logic in his mind, a thought formed: Those are carrion-eater birds over me. Perhaps some of my Fremen will see them and come to investigate.\n“To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings,” his father said. “You must cultivate ecological literacy among the people. That’s\nwhy I’ve created this entirely new form of ecological notation.”\nHe’s repeating things he said to me when I was a Child, Kynes thought.\nHe began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: The sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you're hot; the sun is burning the moisture out of your body.\nHis fingers clawed feebly at the sand.\nThey couldn’t even leave me a stillsuit!\n“The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation from living bodies,” his father said.\nWhy does he keep repeating the obvious? Kynes wondered.\nHe tried to think of moisture in the air—grass covering this dune...open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water open to the sky except in text illustrations. Open water...irrigation water...it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing season, he remembered.\n“Our first goal on Arrakis,” his father said, “is grassland provinces. We will start with these mutated poverty grasses. When we have moisture locked in grasslands, we'll move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of water—small at first—and situated along lines of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind steals. We must create a true sirocco—a moist wind—but we will never get away from the necessity for windtraps.”\nAlways lecturing me, Kynes thought. Why doesn’t he shut up? Can't he see I’m dying?\n“You will die, too,” his father said, “if you don’t get off the bubble that’s forming right now deep underneath you. It’s there and you know it. You can smell the pre-spice gasses. You know the little makers are beginning to lose some of their water into the mass.”\nThe thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it now—sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half-plant, half-animal little makers—and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest, pure, liquid, soothing water into....\nA pre-spice mass!\nHe inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him than it had been.\nKynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried flapping of wings.\nThis is spice desert, he thought. There must be Fremen about even in the day sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.\n“Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life,” his father said. “Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement adjust to physical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement now, align it for our purposes.”\n“Shut up, old man,” Kynes muttered.\n“We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet,” his father said. “We must use man as a constructive ecological force—\ninserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place—to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.”\n“Shut up!” Kynes croaked.\n“It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship between worms and spice,” his father said.\nA worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope. A maker’s sure to come when this bubble bursts. But | have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker without hooks?\nHe could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him. Water so near—only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but no way to trap it on the surface and use it.\nKynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his movements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the sensation was remote.\n“The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of native life forms,” his father said. “How strange that so few people ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near- ideal nitrogen-oxygen-CO?2 balance being maintained\nhere in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The energy sphere of the planet is there to see and understand—a relentless process, but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something occupies that gap. Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained. |\nknew the little maker was there, deep in the sand, long before | ever saw it.”\n“Please stop lecturing me, Father,” Kynes whispered.\nA hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold its wings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned the energy to croak at it. The bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.\n“Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets before now,” his father said. “Nature tends to compensate for diseases, to remove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way.”\nThe hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.\nKynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.\n“The historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on Arrakis,” his father said. “You cannot go on forever stealing what you need without regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a planet are written into its economic and political record. We have the record in front of us and our course is obvious.”\nHe never could stop lecturing, Kynes thought. Lecturing, lecturing, lecturing—always lecturing.\nThe hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand, turned its head first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.\n“Arrakis is a one-crop planet,” his father said. “One crop. It Supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It’s the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected.”\n“I’m ignoring you, Father,” Kynes whispered. “Go away.”\nAnd he thought: Surely there must be some of my Fremen near. They cannot help but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to see if there’s moisture available.\n“The masses of Arrakis will Know that we work to make the land flow with water,” his father said. “Most of them, of course, will have only a semimystical understanding of how we intend to do this. Many, not understanding the prohibitive mass-ratio problem, may even think we'll bring water from some other planet rich in it. Let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in us.”\nIn a minute l'Il get up and tell him what I think of him, Kynes thought. Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.\nThe bird took another hop closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand. Two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it.\n“Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,” his father said. “An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must\ndepend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.”\nWhere is my population now when I need it most? Kynes thought. He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a finger’s width toward the nearest hawk. It hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.\n“Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,” his father said. “A planet’s life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric. Vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate. As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become controlling influences in their own right—and we will have to deal with them, too. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the energy surface—only three per cent—to tip the entire structure over into our self\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a2261b67dfad37bbfc21348f1b72f025449377f93361576892c6db05bbed08d9_v2"}
