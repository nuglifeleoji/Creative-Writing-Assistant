Mother Superior had been here less than an hour this afternoon. And, as often happened, Murbella felt she had been abandoned in a fever dream.\nOdrade’s parting words reverberated in the dream: “The hardest lesson for an acolyte to learn is that she must always go the limit. Your abilities will take you farther than you imagine. Don’t imagine, then. Extend yourself!”\nWhat is my response? That I was taught to cheat? Odrade had done something to call up the patterns of childhood and Honored Matre education. / learned cheating\nas an infant. How to simulate a need and gain attention. Many “how-to’s” in the cheating pattern. The older she got, the easier the cheating. She had learned what the big people around her were demanding. / regurgitated on demand. That was called “education.” Why were the Bene Gesserit so remarkably different in their teaching?\n“| don’t ask you to be honest with me,” Odrade had said. “Be honest with yourself.”\nMurbella despaired of ever rooting out all of the cheating in her past. Why should I? More cheating!\n“Damn you, Odrade!”\nOnly after the words were out did she realize she had spoken them aloud. She started to put a hand to her mouth and aborted the movement. Fever said: “What’s the difference?”\n“Educational bureaucracies dull a child’s questing sensitivity.” Odrade explaining. “The young must be damped down. Never let them know how good they can be. That brings change. Spend lots of committee time talking about how to deal with exceptional students. Don’t spend any time dealing with how the conventional teacher feels threatened by emerging talents and squelches them because of a deep-seated desire to feel superior and safe in a safe environment.”\nShe was talking about Honored Matres.\nConventional teachers?\nThere it was: Behind that facade of wisdom, the Bene Gesserit were unconventional. They often did not think about teaching: they just did it.\nGods! | want to be like them!\nThe thought shocked her and she leaped to her feet, launching herself into a training routine for wrists and arms.\nRealization bit deeper than ever. She did not want to disappoint these teachers. Candor and honesty. Every acolyte heard that. “Basic tools of learning,” Odrade said.\nDistracted by her thoughts, Murbella tumbled hard and stood up, rubbing a bruised shoulder.\nShe had thought at first that the Bene Gesserit protestation must be a lie. /am being so candid with you that I must tell you about my unswerving honesty.\nBut actions confirmed their claim. Odrade’s voice persisted in the fever dream: “That is how you judge.”\nThey had something in the mind, in memory and a balance of intellect no Honored Matre had ever possessed. This thought made her feel small. Enter corruption. It was like liver spots in her feverish thoughts.\nBut I have talent! It required talent to become an Honored Matre.\nDo I still think of myself as an Honored Matre?\nThe Bene Gesserit knew she had not fully committed herself to them. What skills do | have that they could possibly want? Not the skills of deception.\n“Do actions agree with words? There’s your measure of reliability. Never confine yourself to the words.”\nMurbella put her hands over her ears. Shut up, Odrade!\n“How does a Truthsayer separate sincerity from a more fundamental judgment?”\nMurbella dropped her hands to her sides. Maybe I’m really sick. She swept her gaze around the long room. No one there to utter these words. Anyway, it was Odrade’s voice.\n“If you convince yourself, sincerely, you can speak utter balderdash (marvelous old word; look it up), absolute poppylarky in every word and you will be believed. But not by one of our Truthsayers.”\nMurbella’s shoulders sagged. She began to wander aimlessly around the practice floor. Was there no place to escape?\n“Look for the consequences, Murbella. That’s how you ferret out things that work. That’s what our much-vaulted truths are all about.”\nPragmatism?\nIdaho found her then and responded to the wild look in her eyes. “What’s wrong?”\n“I think I’m sick. Really sick. | thought it was something Odrade did to me but...”\nHe caught her as she fell.\n“Help us!”\nFor once, he was glad of the comeyes. A Suk was with them in less than a minute. She bent over Murbella where Idaho cradled her on the floor.\nThe examination was brief. The Suk, a graying older Reverend Mother with the traditional diamond brand on her\nforehead, straightened and said: “Overstressed. She’s not trying to find her limits, she’s going beyond them. We'll put her back into the sensitizing class before we let her continue. l'Il send the Proctors.”\nOdrade found Murbella in the Proctor’s Ward that evening, propped up in a bed, two Proctors taking turns testing her muscle response. A small gesture and they left Odrade alone with Murbella.\n“I tried to avoid complicating things,” Murbella said. Candor and honesty.\n“Trying to avoid complications often creates them.” Odrade sank into a chair beside the bed and put a hand on Murbella’s arm. Muscles quivered under the hand. “We say ‘words are slow, feeling’s faster.’” Odrade withdrew. “What decisions have you been making?”\n“You let me make decisions?”\n“Don’t sneer.” She lifted a hand to prevent interruption. “l didn’t take your previous conditioning into sufficient account. The Honored Matres left you practically incapable of making decisions. Typical of power-hungry societies. Teach their people to diddle around forever. ‘Decisions bring bad results!’ You teach avoidance.”\n“What’s that have to do with me collapsing?” Resentful.\n“Murbella! The worst products of what I’m describing are almost basket cases—can’t make decisions about anything, or leave them until the last possible second and then leap at them like desperate animals.”\n“You told me to go the limit!” Almost wailing.\n“Your limits, Murbella. Not mine. Not Bell’s or those of anyone else. Yours.”\n“I’ve decided | want to be like you.” Very faint.\n“Marvelous! | don’t believe I’ve ever tried to kill myself. Especially when | was pregnant.”\nIn spite of herself, Murbella grinned.\nOdrade stood. “Sleep. You’re going into a special class tomorrow where we'll work on your ability to mesh your\ndecisions with sensitivity to your limits. Remember what | told you. We take care of our own.”\n“Am | yours?” Almost whispered.\n“Since you repeated the oath before the Proctors.” Odrade turned out the lights as she left. Murbella heard her speak to someone before the door closed. “Stop fussing with her. She needs rest.”\nMurbella closed her eyes. The fever dream was gone but in its place was her own memory. “I am a Bene Gesserit. | exist only to serve.”\nShe heard herself saying those words to the Proctors but memory gave them an emphasis not in the original.\nThey knew I was being cynical.\nWhat could you hide from such women?\nShe felt the remembered hand of the Proctor on her forehead and heard the words that had possessed no meaning until this moment.\n“| stand in the sacred human presence. As | do now, so should you stand some day. | pray to your presence that this be so. Let the future remain uncertain for that is the canvas to receive our desires. Thus the human condition faces its perpetual tabula rasa. We possess no more than this moment where we dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence we share and create.”\nConventional but unconventional. She realized that she had not been physically or emotionally prepared for this moment. Tears flowed down her cheeks.\nLaws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit. This is the fine point on which all the legal professions of history have based their job security.\n—BENE GESSERIT CODA\nO n her restless prowlings through Central (infrequent these days but more intense because of that), Odrade looked for signs of slackness and especially for areas of responsibility that were running too smoothly.\nThe Senior Watchdog had her own watchwords: “Show me a completely smooth operation and I'll show you someone who's covering mistakes. Real boats rock.”\nShe said this often and it became an identifying phrase the Sisters (and even some acolytes) employed to comment on Mother Superior.\n“Real boats rock.” Soft chuckles.\nBellonda accompanied Odrade on today’s early morning inspection, not mentioning that “once a month” had been stretched to “once every two months”—if that. This inspection was a week past the mark. Bell wanted to use this time for warnings about Idaho. And she had dragged Tamalane along although Tam was supposed to be reviewing Proctor performance at this hour.\nTwo against one? Odrade wondered. She did not think Bell or Tam suspected what Mother Superior intended. Well, it would come out, as had Taraza’s plan. /n its own time, eh, Tar?\nDown the corridors they stalked, black robes swishing with urgency, eyes missing little. It was all familiar and yet they looked for things that were new. Odrade carried her\nEar-C over her left shoulder like a misplaced diving weight. Never be out of communication range these days.\nBehind the scenes in any Bene Gesserit center were the support facilities: clinic-hospital, kitchen, morgue, garbage control, reclamation systems (attached to sewage and garbage), transport and communications, kitchen provisioning, training and physical maintenance halls, schools for acolytes and postulants, quarters for all of the denominations, meeting centers, testing facilities and much more. Personnel often changed because of the Scattering and movement of people into new responsibilities, all according to subtle Bene Gesserit awareness. But tasks and places for them remained.\nAs they strode swiftly from one area to another, Odrade spoke of the Sisterhood Scattering, not trying to hide her dismay at “the atomic family” they had become.\n“I find it difficult to contemplate humankind spreading into an unlimited universe,” Tam said. “The possibilities . . .”\n“Infinite numbers game.” Odrade stepped across a broken curb. “That should be repaired. We've been playing the infinity game since we learned to jump Foldspace.”\nThere was no joy in Bellonda. “It’s not a game!”\nOdrade could appreciate Bellonda’s feelings. We have never seen empty space. Always more galaxies. Tam’s right. It’s daunting when you focus on that Golden Path.\nMemories of explorations gave the Sisterhood a statistical handle on it but little else. So many habitable planets ina given assemblage and, among those, an expected additional number that could be terraformed.\n“What’s evolving out there?” Tamalane demanded.\nA question they could not answer. Ask what Infinity might produce and the only answer possible was, “Anything.”\nAny good, any evil; any god, any devil.\n“What if Honored Matres are fleeing something?” Odrade asked. “Interesting possibility?”\n“These speculations are useless,” Bellonda muttered. “We don’t even know if Foldspace introduces us to one universe ormany...or even an infinite number of expanding and collapsing bubbles.”\n“Did the Tyrant understand this any better than we do?” Tamalane asked.\nThey paused while Odrade looked into a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, struggling with her past as an Honored Matre and her new training under Mother Superior Odrade.
