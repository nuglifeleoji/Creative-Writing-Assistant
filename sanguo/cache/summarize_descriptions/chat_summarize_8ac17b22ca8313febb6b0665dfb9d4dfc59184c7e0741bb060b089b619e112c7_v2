It often symbolizes the world of martial artists and outlaws, representing a realm where individuals navigate their own paths, often outside the constraints of conventional society. This concept encapsulates the adventures, conflicts, and camaraderie found among those who live by their own codes, typically characterized by a sense of honor and loyalty.\n\nIn a more specific historical context, 江湖 also refers to the waterways associated with the interactions between notable figures in Chinese history, such as the relationship between 周瑜 (Zhou Yu) and 蒋干 (Jiang Gan).
