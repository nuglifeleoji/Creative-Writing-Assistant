After experiencing a defeat, 袁绍 aimed to return to 冀州, underscoring its critical role in his military and political ambitions. His desire to control 冀州 was driven by its abundant resources and advantageous position, which were essential for bolstering his military strength.\n\nRecently, 袁绍 had successfully acquired 冀州, which not only enhanced his military capabilities but also solidified his influence over the region.
