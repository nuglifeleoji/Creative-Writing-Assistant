Already he could feel a Bator’s insignia at his neck—and someday, Burseg .. . Even, one day, Bashar. People who served well in the corps of Farad’n, grandson of the late Shaddam IV, earned rich promotions. One day, when the Prince was seated on his rightful throne, there would be even greater promotions. A Bashar’s rank might not be the end of it. There were Baronies and Earldoms to be had on the many worlds of this realm... once the twin Atreides were removed.\nThe Fremen must return to his original faith, to his genius in forming human communities; he must return to the past, where that lesson of survival was learned in the struggle with Arrakis. The only business of the Fremen should be that of opening his soul to the inner teachings. The worlds of the Imperium, the Landsraad and the CHOAM Confederacy have no message to give him. They will only rob him of his soul.\n—THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN\nll around the Lady Jessica, reaching far out into the dun flatness of the landing plain upon which her transport rested, crackling and sighing after its dive from space, stood\nan ocean of humanity. She estimated half a million people were there and perhaps only a third of them pilgrims. They stood in awesome silence, attention fixed on the transport’s exit platform, whose shadowy hatchway concealed her and her party.\nIt lacked two hours until noon, but already the air above that throng reflected a dusty shimmering in promise of the day’s heat.\nJessica touched her silver-flecked copper hair where it framed her oval face beneath the aba hood of a Reverend Mother. She knew she did not look her best after the long trip, and the black of the aba was not her best color. But she had worn this garment here before. The significance of the aba robe would not be lost upon the Fremen. She sighed. Space travel did not agree with her, and there’d been that added burden of memories—the other trip from Caladan to Arrakis when her Duke had been forced into this fief against his better judgment.\nSlowly, probing with her Bene Gesserit-trained ability to detect significant minutiae, she scanned the sea of people.\nThere were stillsuit hoods of dull grey, garments of Fremen from the deep desert; there were white-robed pilgrims with penitence marks on their shoulders; there were scattered pockets of rich merchants, hoodless in light clothing to flaunt their disdain for water loss in Arrakeen’s parching air... and there was the delegation from the Society of the Faithful, green robed and heavily hooded, standing aloof within the sanctity of their own group.\nOnly when she lifted her gaze from the crowd did the scene take on any similarity to that which had greeted her upon her arrival with her beloved Duke. How long ago had that been? More than twenty years. She did not like to think of those intervening heartbeats. Time lay within her like a dead weight, and it was as though her years away from this planet had never been.\nOnce more into the dragon’s mouth, she thought.\nHere, upon this plain, her son had wrested the Imperium from the late Shaddam IV. A convulsion of history had imprinted this place into men’s minds and beliefs.\nShe heard the restless stirring of the entourage behind her and again she sighed. They must wait for Alia, who had been delayed. Alia’s party could be seen now approaching from the far edge of the throng, creating a human wave as a wedge of Royal Guards opened a passage.\nJessica scanned the landscape once more. Many differences submitted to her searching stare. A prayer balcony had been added to the landing field’s control tower. And visible far off to the left across the plain stood the awesome pile of plasteel which Paul had built as his fortress —his “sietch above the sand.” It was the largest integrated single construction ever to rise from the hand of man. Entire cities could have been housed within its walls and room to spare. Now it housed the most powerful governing force in the Imperium, Alia’s “Society of the Faithful,” which she had built upon her brother’s body.\nThat place must go, Jessica thought.\nAlia’s delegation had reached the foot of the exit ramp and stood there expectantly. Jessica recognized Stilgar’s craggy features. And God forfend! There stood the Princess lrulan hiding her savagery in that seductive body with its cap of golden hair exposed by a vagrant breeze. Irulan seemed not to have aged a day; it was an affront. And there, at the point of the wedge, was Alia, her features impudently youthful, her eyes staring upward into the hatchway’s shadows. Jessica’s mouth drew into a straight line and she scanned her daughter's face. A leaden sensation pulsed through Jessica’s body and she heard the surf of her own life within her ears. The rumors were true! Horrible! Horrible! Alia had fallen into the forbidden way. The evidence was there for the initiate to read. Abomination!\nIn the few moments it took her to recover, Jessica realized how much she had hoped to find the rumors false.\nWhat of the twins? she asked herself. Are they lost, too?\nSlowly, as befitted the mother of a god, Jessica moved out of the shadows and onto the lip of the ramp. Her entourage remained behind as instructed. These next few moments were the crucial ones. Jessica stood alone in full view of the throng. She heard Gurney Halleck cough nervously behind her. Gurney had objected: “Not even a shield on you? Gods below, woman! You’re insane!”\nBut among Gurney’s most valuable features was a core of obedience. He would say his piece and then he would obey. Now he obeyed.\nThe human sea emitted a sound like the hiss of a giant sSandworm as Jessica emerged. She raised her arms in the benedictory to which the priesthood had conditioned the Imperium. With significant pockets of tardiness, but still like one giant organism, the people sank to their knees. Even the official party complied.\nJessica had marked out the places of delay, and she knew that other eyes behind her and among her agents in the\nthrong had memorized a temporary map with which to seek out the tardy.\nAs Jessica remained with her arms upraised, Gurney and his men emerged. They moved swiftly past her down the ramp, ignoring the official party’s startled looks, joining the agents who identified themselves by handsign. Quickly they fanned out through the human sea, leaping Knots of kneeling figures, dashing through narrow lanes. A few of their targets saw the danger and tried to flee. They were the easiest: a thrown knife, a garrote loop and the runners went down. Others were herded out of the press, hands bound, feet hobbled.\nThrough it all, Jessica stood with arms outstretched, blessing by her presence, keeping the throng subservient. She read the signs of spreading rumors though, and knew the dominant one because it had been planted: “The Reverend Mother returns to weed out the slackers. Bless the mother of our Lord!”\nWhen it was over—a few dead bodies sprawled on the sand, captives removed to holding pens beneath the landing tower—Jessica lowered her arms. Perhaps three minutes had elapsed. She knew there was little likelihood Gurney and his men had taken any of the ringleaders, the ones who posed the most potent threat. They would be the alert and sensitive ones. But the captives would contain some interesting fish as well as the usual culls and dullards.\nJessica lowered her arms and, cheering, the people surged to their feet.\nAs though nothing untoward had happened, Jessica walked alone down the ramp, avoiding her daughter, singling out Stilgar for concentrated attention. The black beard which fanned out across the neck of his stillsuit hood like a wild delta contained flecks of grey, but his eyes carried that same whiteless intensity they’d presented to her on their first encounter in the desert. Stilgar knew what had just occurred, and approved. Here stood a true Fremen\nNaib, a leader of men and capable of bloody decisions. His first words were completely in character.\n“Welcome home, My Lady. It’s always a pleasure to see direct and effective action.”\nJessica allowed herself a tiny smile. “Close the port, Stil. No one leaves until we’ve questioned those we took.”\n“It’s already done, My Lady,” Stilgar said. “Gurney’s man and | planned this together.”\n“Those were your men, then, the ones who helped.”\n“Some of them, My Lady.”\nShe read the hidden reservations, nodded. “You studied me pretty well in those old days, Stil.”\n“As you once were at pains to tell me, My Lady, one observes the survivors and learns from them.”\nAlia stepped forward then and Stilgar stood aside while Jessica confronted her daughter.\nKnowing there was no way to hide what she had learned, Jessica did not even try concealment. Alia could read the minutiae when she needed, could read as well as any adept of the Sisterhood. She would already know by Jessica’s behavior what had been seen and interpreted. They were enemies for whom the word mortal touched only the surface.\nAlia chose anger as the easiest and most proper reaction.\n“How dare you plan an action such as this without consulting me?” she demanded, pushing her face close to Jessica’s.\nJessica spoke mildly: “As you’ve just heard, Gurney didn’t even let me in on the whole plan. It was thought...”\n“And you, Stilgar!” Alia said, rounding on him. “To whom are you loyal?”\n“My oath is to Muad’Dib’s children,” Stilgar said, speaking stiffly. “We have removed a threat to them.”\n“And why doesn’t that fill you with joy .. . daughter?” Jessica asked.\nAlia blinked, glanced once at her mother, suppressed the inner tempest, and even managed a straight-toothed smile. “I am filled with joy ... mother,” she said. And to her own surprise, Alia found that she was happy, experiencing a terrible delight that it was all out in the open at last between herself and her mother. The moment she had dreaded was past and the power balance had not really been changed. “We will discuss this in more detail at a more convenient time,” Alia said, speaking both to her mother and Stilgar.\n“But of course,” Jessica said, turning with a movement of dismissal to face the Princess Irulan.\nFor a few brief heartbeats, Jessica and the Princess stood silently studying each other—two Bene Gesserits who had broken with the Sisterhood for the same reason: love... both of them for love of men who now were dead. This Princess had loved Paul in vain, becoming his wife but not his mate. And now she lived only for the children given to Paul by his Fremen concubine, Chani.\nJessica spoke first: “Where are my grandchildren?”\n“At Sietch Tabr.”\n“Too dangerous for them here; | understand.”\nlrulan permitted herself a faint nod. She had observed the interchange between Jessica and Alia, but put upon it an interpretation for which Alia had prepared her. “/essica has returned to the Sisterhood and we both know they have plans for Paul’s children.” \\rulan had never been the most accomplished adept in the Bene Gesserit—valuable more for the fact that she was a daughter of Shaddam IV than for any other reason; often too proud to exert herself in extending her capabilities. Now she chose sides with an abruptness which did no credit to her training.\n“Really, Jessica,” Irulan said, “the Royal Council should\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BATOR<|>PERSON<|>Bator is a rank or insignia mentioned in the context of military promotions within the corps of Farad'n, grandson of the late Shaddam IV)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURSEG<|>PERSON<|>Burseg is a rank or title mentioned as a potential promotion for those who serve well in the corps of Farad'n)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASHAR<|>PERSON<|>Bashar is a high-ranking military title mentioned as a potential promotion, possibly leading to Baronies and Earldoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARAD'N<|>PERSON<|>Farad'n is the grandson of the late Shaddam IV and a prince whose corps offers promotions for loyal service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHADDAM IV<|>PERSON<|>Shaddam IV is the late grandfather of Farad'n and a former ruler)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>PERSON<|>The Atreides are mentioned as twins who need to be removed for Farad'n to claim his rightful throne)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>PERSON<|>The Fremen are a desert-dwelling people who must return to their original faith and survival lessons from Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is the desert planet where the Fremen learned their survival lessons and where key events took place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPERIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Imperium is the governing body of the many worlds mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANDSRAAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Landsraad is a political body mentioned as having no message for the Fremen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOAM CONFEDERACY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CHOAM Confederacy is mentioned as having no message for the Fremen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN<|>PERSON<|>The Preacher at Arrakeen is a figure who speaks about the Fremen's need to return to their original faith)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Lady Jessica is a Reverend Mother and the mother of Paul Atreides, returning to Arrakis after many years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is the planet from which Lady Jessica and her Duke originally traveled to Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a Sisterhood with trained abilities, to which Lady Jessica and Princess Irulan once belonged)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>GEO<|>Arrakeen is a city on Arrakis where Lady Jessica's transport landed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIETY OF THE FAITHFUL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Society of the Faithful is a delegation present at Lady Jessica's arrival, associated with Alia's rule)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is the daughter of Lady Jessica and sister of Paul Atreides, now a powerful figure in the Imperium)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen Naib and leader who welcomes Lady Jessica back to Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCESS IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>Princess Irulan is a Bene Gesserit and the wife of Paul Atreides, now caring for his children)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>PERSON<|>Gurney Halleck is a loyal follower of Lady Jessica who assists in her security operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a location where Paul's children are kept, deemed safer than Arrakeen)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD'N<|>SHADDAM IV<|>Farad'n is the grandson of the late Shaddam IV<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>Lady Jessica is the mother of Paul Atreides<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>ALIA<|>Lady Jessica is the mother of Alia<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>Alia is the sister of Paul Atreides<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINCESS IRULAN<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>Princess Irulan was the wife of Paul Atreides<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Lady Jessica was a member of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINCESS IRULAN<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Princess Irulan was a member of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>ARRAKIS<|>Lady Jessica has a deep history with Arrakis, having lived there before<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>SOCIETY OF THE FAITHFUL<|>Alia built the Society of the Faithful upon her brother's legacy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>FREMEN<|>Stilgar is a Naib (leader) of the Fremen<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>LADY JESSICA<|>Gurney Halleck is a loyal follower of Lady Jessica<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINCESS IRULAN<|>PAUL'S CHILDREN<|>Princess Irulan cares for Paul's children<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PAUL'S CHILDREN<|>Lady Jessica is the grandmother of Paul's children<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
