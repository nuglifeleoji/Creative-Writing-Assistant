Mental preparations as an acolyte (firmly impressed in the Agony) had been eroded by Other Memory and accumulations of time. The admonition: “Withdrawal removes an essential of your life\nand, if it occurs in late middle age, can kill you.” How little that meant now.\n“Withdrawal has intense meaning for me,” Odrade said. “l am one of those for whom the morning melange is painful. I’m sure they told you this happens.”\n“I’m sorry, Mother Superior.”\nOdrade studied the map. It showed a longer finger of desert thrusting northward and a pronounced widening of drylands to the southeast of Central where Sheeana had her station. Presently, Odrade returned her attention to Streggi, who was watching Mother Superior with new interest.\nBrought up short by thoughts of the spice’s darker side!\n“The uniqueness of melange is seldom considered in our age,” Odrade said. “All of the old narcotics in which humans have indulged possess a remarkable factor in common—all except the spice. They all brought shorter life and pain.”\n“We were told, Mother Superior.”\n“But you probably were not told that a fact of governance could be obscured by our concern with Honored Matres. There’s an energy greed in governments (yes, even in ours) that can dump you into a trap. If you serve me, you will feel it in your guts because every morning you will watch me suffer. Let knowledge of it sink into you, this deadly trap. Don’t become uncaring pushers, caught in a system that displaces life with careless death as Honored Matres do. Remember: Acceptable narcotics can be taxed to pay salaries or otherwise create jobs for uncaring functionaries.”\nStreggi was puzzled. “But melange extends our lives, increases health and arouses appetites for—”\nShe was stopped by Odrade’s scowl.\nRight out of the Acolyte Manual!\n“It has this other side, Streggi, and you see it in me. The Acolyte Manual does not lie. But melange is a narcotic and we are addicted.”\n“I know it’s not gentle with everyone, Mother Superior. But you said Honored Matres don’t use it.”\n“The substitute they employ replaces melange with few benefits except to prevent withdrawal agonies and death. It is parallel addictive.”\n“And the captive?”\n“Murbella used it and now she uses melange. They are interchangeable. Interesting?”\n“I... Suppose we will learn more of this. | notice, Mother Superior, that you never call them whores.”\n“As acolytes do? Ahh, Streggi, Bellonda has been a bad influence. Oh, | recognize the pressures.” As Streggi started to protest. “Acolytes feel the threat. They look at Chapterhouse and think of it as their fortress for the long night of the whores.”\n“Something like that, Mother Superior.” Extremely hesitant.\n“Streggi, this planet is only another temporary place. Today we go south and impress that upon you. Find Tamalane, please, and tell her to make the arrangements we discussed for our visit to Sheeana. Speak to no one else about it.”\n“Yes, Mother Superior. Do you mean | will accompany you?”\n“I want you by my side. Tell the one you are training that she now has full charge of my map.”\nAs Streggi left, Odrade thought of Sheeana and Idaho. She wants to talk to him and he wants to talk to her.\nComeye analysis noted that these two sometimes conversed by hand-signals while hiding most of the movements with their bodies. It had the look of an old Atreides battle language. Odrade recognized some of it but not enough to determine content. Bellonda wanted an explanation from Sheeana. “Secrets!” Odrade was more cautious. “Let it go a bit. Perhaps something interesting will come of it.”\nWhat does Sheeana want?\nWhatever Duncan had in mind it concerned Teg. Creating the pain required for Teg to recover his original memories went against Duncan’s grain.\nOdrade had noted this when she interrupted Duncan at his console yesterday.\n“You're late, Dar.” Not looking up from whatever it was he did there. Late? It was early evening.\nHe had been calling her Dar frequently for several years, a goad, a reminder that he resented his fishtank existence. The goad irritated Bellonda, who argued against “his damned familiarities.” He called Bellonda “Bell,” of course. Duncan was generous with his needle.\nRemembering this, Odrade paused before entering her workroom. Duncan had slammed a fist into the counter beside his console. “There’s got to be a better way for Teg!”\nA better way? What does he have in mind?\nMovement down the corridor beyond the workroom brought her out of this reflection. Streggi returning from Tamalane. Streggi entered the Acolyte Ready Room. Giving the word to her replacement on the desert map.\nA stack of Archival records waited on Odrade’s table. Bellonda! Odrade stared at the pile. No matter how much she tried to delegate there was always this organized residue that her councillors insisted only Mother Superior could handle. Much of this new lot came from Bellonda’s demand for “suggestions and analyses.”\nOdrade touched her console. “Bell!”\nThe voice of an Archives clerk responded: “Mother Superior?”\n“Get Bell up here! | want her in front of me as fast as her fat legs can move!”\nIt was less than a minute. Bellonda stood in front of the worktable like a chastened acolyte. They all knew that tone in Mother Superior’s voice.\nOdrade touched the stack on her table and jerked her hand back as though shocked. “What in the name of Shaitan\nis all of that?”\n“We judged it significant.”\n“You think | have to see everything and anything? Where’s the keynoting? This is sloppy work, Bell! I’m not stupid and neither are you. But this... in the face of this...”\n“| delegate as much as—”\n“Delegate? Look at this! Which must I see and which may | delegate? Not one keynote!”\n“I'll see that it’s corrected immediately.”\n“Indeed you will, Bell. Because Tam and | are going south today, an unannounced inspection tour and a visit with Sheeana. And while I’m gone, you will sit in my chair. See how you like this daily deluge!”\n“Will you be out of touch?”\n“I'll have a lightline and Ear-C at all times.”\nBellonda breathed easier.\n“I suggest, Bell, that you get back to Archives and put someone in charge who will take responsibility. l'm damned if you’re not beginning to act like bureaucrats. Covering your asses!”\n“Real boats rock, Dar.”\nWas that Bell attempting humor? All was not lost!\nOdrade waved a hand over her projector and there was Tamalane in the Transport Hall. “Tam?”\n“Yes?” Without turning from an assignment list.\n“How soon can we leave?”\n“About two hours.”\n“Call me when you're ready. Oh, and Streggi goes with us. Make room for her.” Odrade blanked the projection before Tamalane could respond.\nThere were things she should be doing, Odrade knew. Tam and Bell were not the only sources of Mother Superior’s concerns.\nSixteen planets remaining to us...and that includes Buzzell, definitely a place in peril. Only sixteen! She pushed\nthat thought aside. No time for it.\nMurbella. Should I call her and... No. That can wait. The new Board of Proctors? Let Bell deal with that. Community disbandings?\nSiphoning personnel into a new Scattering had forced consolidations. Staying ahead of the desert! It was depressing and she did not feel she could face it today. /’m always fidgety before a trip.\nAbruptly, Odrade fled the workroom and went stalking the corridors, looking into how her charges were performing, pausing in doorways, noting what the students read, how they behaved in their everlasting prana-bindu exercises.\n“What are you reading there?” demanded of a young second-stage acolyte at a projector in a semi-darkened room.\n“The diaries of Tolstoy, Mother Superior.”\nThat knowing look in the acolyte’s eyes said: “Do you have his words directly in Other Memory?” The question was right there on the edge of the girl’s tongue! They were always trying such petty gambits when they caught her alone.\n“Tolstoy was a family name!” Odrade snapped. “By your mention of diaries, | presume you refer to Count Leo\nNikolayevich.” “Yes, Mother Superior.” Abashedly aware of censure. Softening, Odrade threw a quotation at the girl: “ʻI am not\na river, | am a net.’ He spoke those words at Yasnaya Polyana when he was only twelve. You'll not find them in his diaries but they are probably the most significant words he ever uttered.”\nOdrade turned away before the acolyte could thank her. Always teaching!\nShe wandered down to the main kitchens then and inspected them, tracing inner edges of racked pots for grease, noting the cautious way even the teaching chef observed her progress.\nThe kitchen was steamy with good smells from lunch preparations. There was a restorative sound of chopping and stirring but the usual banter stopped at her entrance.\nShe went around the long counter with its busy cooks to the teaching chef’s raised platform. He was a great beefy man with prominent cheekbones, his face as florid as the meats over which he ministered. Odrade had no doubts he was one of history’s great chefs. His name suited him: Placido Salat. He was assured of a warm place in her thoughts for several reasons, including the fact that he had trained her personal chef. Important visitors in the days before Honored Matres had received a kitchen tour and a taste of specialties.\n“May | introduce our senior chef, Placido Salat?”\nHis beef placido (low case his choice) was the envy of many. Almost raw and served with an herbed and spicy mustard sauce that did not obscure the meat.\nOdrade thought the dish too exotic but never judged it aloud.\nWhen she had Salat’s full attention (after a slight interruption to correct a sauce) Odrade said: “I’m hungry for something special, Placido.”\nHe recognized the opening. This was how she always began a request for her “special dish.”\n“Perhaps an oyster stew,” he suggested.\nIt’s a dance, Odrade thought. They both knew what she wanted.\n“Excellent!” she agreed and went into the required performance. “But it must be treated gently, Placido, the oysters not overcooked. Some of our own powdered dry celery in the broth.”\n“And perhaps a bit of paprika?”\n“I always prefer it that way. Be extremely careful with the melange. A breath of it and no more.”\n“Of course, Mother Superior!” Eyes rolling in horror at the thought he might use too much melange. “So easy for the\nspice to dominate.”\n“Cook the oysters in clam nectar, Placido. | would prefer you watch over them yourself, stirring gently until the edges of the oysters just start to curl.”\n“Not a second longer, Mother Superior.”\n“Heat some quite creamy milk on the side. Don’t boil it!”\nPlacido displayed astonishment that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, a powerful and influential leader dealing with addiction to melange and governance issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREGGI<|>PERSON<|>An acolyte under Odrade's guidance, involved in training and assisting Mother Superior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>A significant figure with a station southeast of Central, involved in secret communications with Duncan Idaho)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A key figure with a fishtank existence, resentful of his situation and involved in secret communications with Sheeana)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>A councillor and archivist, often at odds with Odrade and involved in administrative duties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>A trusted associate of Odrade, involved in logistics and transport arrangements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>A captive who transitioned from using a substitute narcotic to melange, now under the Bene Gesserit's watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>A figure whose original memories Duncan Idaho is trying to recover, involving painful processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACIDO SALAT<|>PERSON<|>The senior chef in the Bene Gesserit kitchens, known for his culinary expertise and special dishes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>The fortress-like planet serving as a temporary base for the Bene Gesserit, under threat from Honored Matres)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL<|>GEO<|>A central location in the Bene Gesserit's domain, with significant drylands and stations like Sheeana's)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUZZELL<|>GEO<|>A planet in peril, one of the remaining sixteen under Bene Gesserit control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YASNAYA POLYANA<|>GEO<|>A location associated with Count Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy, mentioned in historical context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive organization led by Mother Superior Odrade, dealing with governance, addiction, and external threats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rival group to the Bene Gesserit, referred to as \"whores\" by acolytes, known for their use of a substitute narcotic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGONY<|>EVENT<|>A rigorous mental preparation process for acolytes, involving firm impressions and challenges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OTHER MEMORY<|>EVENT<|>A collective memory access technique used by the Bene Gesserit, influencing decisions and knowledge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>A strategic dispersal of personnel by the Bene Gesserit to consolidate resources and stay ahead of threats)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>STREGGI<|>Odrade is mentoring Streggi, who is training under her guidance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade is planning a visit to Sheeana's station, indicating a supervisory relationship<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Odrade interacts with Duncan Idaho, who resents his confined existence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BELLONDA<|>Odrade frequently clashes with Bellonda over administrative and governance issues<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TAMALANE<|>Odrade relies on Tamalane for logistical support and travel arrangements<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MURBELLA<|>Odrade oversees Murbella's transition from a substitute narcotic to melange<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TEG<|>Odrade is aware of Duncan's efforts to recover Teg's memories<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>PLACIDO SALAT<|>Odrade has a professional relationship with Placido Salat, requesting special dishes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>Odrade governs from Chapterhouse, which is under threat<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the organization<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Odrade views the Honored Matres as a significant threat to the Bene Gesserit<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Sheeana and Duncan Idaho communicate secretly, possibly using an old Atreides battle language<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TEG<|>Duncan Idaho is working to recover Teg's original memories, despite the pain involved<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>ARCHIVES<|>Bellonda is heavily involved in the Archives, often delegating tasks to clerks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMALANE<|>TRANSPORT HALL<|>Tamalane is responsible for transport arrangements, including Odrade's trip<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres are rival organizations with significant tensions<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
