关于这个问题，石神没有把握自己能提出最和逻辑的解答。那是因为他心知肚明，自己渴望像以往一样去“天亭”，因为唯有“天亭”是花冈靖子和他唯一的交点。不去那家便利店，他就见不到她。\n    抵达那个公用电话后，他插进电话卡，卡片上印着学校同事的小宝宝。\n    他拨的是花冈靖子的手机号码。他认为家里的电话或许会遭到警方装设窃听器。虽然警方表示不会窃听一般老百姓的通讯，但他不相信。\n    “喂？”传来靖子的声音。石神之前就跟她说过，要联络时会打公用电话。\n    “我是石神。”\n    “啊，是。”\n    “刑警刚才来过我家，我想应该也去过你家吧？”\n    “对，刚刚才来过。”\n    “他们问了些什么？”\n    石神在脑中整理、分析、记忆靖子所说的内容，看来警方在现阶段并没有特别怀疑靖子，盘问她的不在场证明应该只是例行手续。\n    不过一旦查明富坚的行动路线，发现他来找过靖子后，刑警想必会脸色大变的朝她展开攻势，首先应该会追究她说最近没见过富坚的这段供述，不过他早已指点过她该如何防御这点。\n    “令渊也见过刑警吗？”\n    “不，美里待在里面房间。”\n    “是吗？不过他们应该迟早也会想找令媛问话。到时该怎么应付，我已经说过了吧？”\n    “是的，您吩咐的很仔细，她自己也没问题。”\n    “我要唆的再强调一次，没必要演戏，只要机械式地回答对方的问题就行了。”\n    “是，这个我也告诉过她了。”\n    “还有，你给刑警看过电影票根了吗？”\n    “没有，今天没给他们看。因为您说过，对方没这么要求之前不用拿出来。”\n    “这样就对了，你把票根放在哪里？”\n    “在抽屉里。”\n    “请夹在电影简介中，没有人会小心保管电影票根，如果放在抽屉里反而显得可疑。”\n    “我知道了。”\n    “对了，”石神咽下一口口水，用力握着话筒，“‘天亭’的人知道我常去买便当的事情吗？”\n    “什么意思……？”\n    “换句话说，我想请教你，店里的人怎么看待住你隔壁的男人常来买便当的这件事？这点很重要，请你务必坦白告诉我。”\n    “这个啊，店长也说您肯常来光临，他高兴都来不及。”\n    “他们知道我是你的邻居吧？”\n    “对……请问这有什么不妥吗？”\n    “不，这点我自由考虑。总之请你照我们事先商量的行动就好，知道了吗？”\n    “我知道了。”\n    “那就这样。”石神把话筒拿开耳旁。\n    “啊，石神先生，请等一下。”靖子叫住他。\n    “有事吗？”\n    “谢谢您处处费心，您的恩情没齿难忘。”\n    “哪里……那就这样。”石神挂断电话。\n    她最后的那句话，令他全身热血沸腾。�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>天亭<|>ORGANIZATION<|>天亭 is a
