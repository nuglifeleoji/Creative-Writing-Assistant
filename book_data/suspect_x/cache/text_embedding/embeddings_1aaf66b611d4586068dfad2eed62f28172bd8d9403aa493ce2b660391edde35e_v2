Odrade’s interpretation of that message in the stones of Rakis conveyed an old warning:\nThis, too, shall pass away.\nAre we to end now, crushed by ravenous hordes from the Scattering?\nBut the secret of the axlotl tanks was almost within the Sisterhood’s grasp.\nIf we gain that, nothing can stop us!\nTaraza swung her gaze around the details of her room. The Bene Gesserit power was still here. Chapter House remained concealed behind a moat of no-ships, its location unrecorded except in the minds of her own people. Invisibility.\nTemporary invisibility! Accidents occurred.\nTaraza squared her shoulders. Take precautions but don’t live in their shadows, constantly furtive. The Litany Against Fear served a useful purpose when avoiding shadows.\nFrom anyone but Odrade, the warning message with its disturbing implications that the Tyrant still guided his Golden Path would have been far less fearsome.\nThat damnable Atreides talent!\n“No more than a secret society?”\nTaraza gritted her teeth in frustration.\n“Memories are not enough unless they call you to noble purpose!”\nAnd what if it was true that the Sisterhood no longer heard the music of life?\nDamn him! The Tyrant could still touch them.\nWhat is he trying to tell us? His Golden Path could not be in peril. The Scattering had seen to that. Humans had spread their kind outward on uncounted courses like the spines of a hedgehog.\nHad he seen a vision of the Scattered Ones returning? Could he possibly have anticipated this bramble patch at the foot of his Golden Path?\nHe knew we would suspect his powers. He knew it!\nTaraza thought about the mounting reports of the Lost Ones who were returning to their roots. A remarkable diversity of people and artifacts accompanied by a remarkable degree of secrecy and wide evidence of conspiracy. No-ships of a peculiar design, weapons and artifacts of breathtaking sophistication. Diverse peoples and diverse ways.\nSome, astonishingly primitive. At least on the surface.\nAnd they wanted much more than melange. Taraza recognized the peculiar form of mysticism that drove the Scattered Ones back: “We want your elder secrets!”\nThe message of the Honored Matres was clear enough, too: “We will take what we want.”\nOdrade has it all right in her hands, Taraza thought. She had Sheeana. Soon, if Burzmali succeeded, she would have the ghola. She had the Tleilaxu Master of Masters. She could have Rakis itself!\nIf only she were not an Atreides.\nTaraza glanced at the projected words still dancing above her tabletop: a comparison of this newest Duncan Idaho with all of the slain ones. Each new ghola had been slightly different from its predecessors. That was clear enough. The Tleilaxu were perfecting something. But what? Was the clue hidden in these new Face Dancers? The Tleilaxu obviously sought an undetectable Face Dancer, mimics whose mimicry\nreached perfection, shape-copiers who copied not only the\nsurface memories of their victims but the deepest thoughts and identity as well. It was a form of immortality even more enticing than the one the Tleilaxu Masters used at present.\nThat obviously was why they followed this course.\nHer own analysis agreed with the majority of her advisors: Such a mimic would become the copied person. Odrade’s reports on the Face Dancer-Tuek were highly suggestive. Even the Tleilaxu Masters might not be able to Shake such a Face Dancer out of its mimic shape and behavior.\nAnd its beliefs.\nDamn Odrade! She had painted her Sisters into a corner. They had no choice except to follow Odrade’s lead and Odrade knew it!\nHow did she know it? Was it that wild talent again?\n| cannot act blindly. | must know.\nTaraza went through the well-remembered regimen to restore a sense of calm. She dared not make momentous decisions in a frustrated mood. A long look at the statuette of Chenoeh helped. Lifting herself from the chairdog, Taraza returned to her favorite window.\nIt often soothed her to stare out at this landscape, observing how the distances changed with the daily movement of sunlight and shifts in the planet’s well- managed weather.\nHunger prodded her.\nI| will eat with the acolytes and lay Sisters today.\nIt helped at times to gather the young around her and remember the persistence of the eating rituals, the daily timing—morning, noon, and evening. That formed a reliable cement. She enjoyed watching her people. They were like a tide speaking of deeper things, of unseen forces and greater powers that persisted because the Bene Gesserit had found the ways of flowing with that persistence.\nThese thoughts renewed Taraza’s balance. Nagging questions could be placed temporarily at a distance. She could look at them without passion.\nOdrade and the Tyrant were right: Without noble purpose we are nothing.\nOne could not escape, though, the fact that critical decisions were being made on Rakis by a person who suffered from those recurring Atreides flaws. Odrade had always displayed typical Atreides weakness. She had been positively benevolent to erring acolytes. Affections developed out of such behavior!\nDangerous and mind-clouding affections.\nThis weakened others, who then were required to compensate for such laxity. More competent Sisters were called upon to take erring acolytes in hand and correct the weaknesses. Of course, Odrade’s behavior had exposed these flaws in acolytes. One must admit this. Perhaps Odrade reasoned thus.\nWhen she thought this way, something subtle and powerful shifted in Taraza’s perceptions. She was forced to put down a deep sense of loneliness. It rankled. Melancholy could be quite as mind-clouding as affection... or even love. Taraza and her watchful Memory Sisters ascribed such emotional responses to awareness of mortality. She was forced to confront the fact that one day she would be no more than a set of memories in someone else’s living flesh.\nMemories and accidental discoveries, she saw, had made her vulnerable. And just when she needed every available faculty!\nBut I am not yet dead.\nTaraza knew how to restore herself. And she knew the consequences. Always after these bouts of melancholy she regained an even firmer grip on her life and its purposes. Odrade’s flawed behavior was a source of her Mother Superior’s strength.\nOdrade knew it. Taraza smiled grimly at this awareness. The Mother Superior’s authority over her Sisters always became stronger when she returned from melancholy. Others had observed this but only Odrade knew about the rage.\nThere!\nTaraza realized that she had confronted the distressful seeds of her frustration.\nOdrade had clearly recognized on several occasions what sat at the core of the Mother Superior’s behavior. A giant howl of rage against the uses others had made of her life. The power of that suppressed rage was daunting even though it could never be expressed in a way that vented it. That rage must never be allowed to heal. How it hurt! Odrade’s awareness made the pain even more intense.\nSuch things did what they were supposed to do, of course. Bene Gesserit impositions developed certain mental muscles. They built up layers of callousness that could never be revealed to outsiders. Love was one of the most dangerous forces in the universe. They had to protect themselves against it. A Reverend Mother could never become intimately personal, not even in the services of the Bene Gesserit.\nSimulation: We play the necessary role that saves us. The Bene Gesserit will persist!\nHow long would they be subservient this time? Another thirty-five hundred years? Well, damn them all! It would still be only a temporary thing.\nTaraza turned her back on the window and its restorative view. She did feel restored. New strength flowed into her. There was strength enough to overcome that gnawing reluctance which had kept her from making the essential decision.\n/ will go to Rakis.\nShe no longer could evade the source of her own reluctance.\n| may have to do what Bellonda wants.\nSurvival of self, of species, and of environment, these are what drive humans. You can observe how the order of importance changes in a lifetime. What are the things of immediate concern at a given age? Weather? The state of the digestion? Does she (or he) really care? All of those various hungers that flesh can sense and hope to satisfy. What else could possibly matter?\n—LETO II TO HWI NOREE, HIS VOICE: DAR-ES-BALAT\nMI iles Teg awoke in darkness to find himself being carried on a litter sling supported by suspensors. By their faint energy glow, he could see the tiny suspensor bulbs in an updangling row around him.\nThere was a gag in his mouth. His hands were securely tied behind his back. His eyes remained uncovered.\nSo they don’t care what I see.\nWho they were he could not tell. The bobbing motions of the dark shapes around him suggested they were descending uneven terrain. A trail? The litter sling rode smoothly on its suspensors. He could sense the faint humming from the suspensors when his party stopped to negotiate the turn of a difficult passage.\nNow and then through some intervening obstruction, he saw the flickering of a light ahead. They entered the lighted area presently and stopped. He saw a single glowglobe about three meters off the ground, tethered on a pole and moving gently in a cold breeze. By its yellow glow he discerned a shack in the center of a muddy clearing, many tracks in trampled snow. He saw bushes and a few sparse trees around the clearing. Someone passed a brighter handlight across his face. Nothing was said but Teg saw a hand gesture toward the shack. He had seldom seen such a\ndilapidated structure. It looked ready to collapse at the slightest touch. He bet himself that the roof leaked.\nOnce more, his party lurched into motion, swinging him toward the shack. He studied his escort in the dim light— faces muffled to the eyes in a cover that obscured mouths and chins. Hoods hid their hair. The clothing was bulky and concealed body details except for the general articulation of arms and legs.\nThe pole-tethered glowglobe went dark.\nA door opened in the shack, sending a brilliant glare across the clearing. His escort hustled him inside and left him there. He heard the door close behind them.\nIt was almost blindingly bright inside after the darkness. Teg blinked until his eyes adapted to the change. With an odd sense of displacement, he looked around him. He had expected the shack’s interior to match its exterior but here was a neat room almost bare of furnishings—only three chairs, a small table and... he drew in a sharp breath: an Ixian Probe! Couldn’t they smell the shere on his breath?\nIf they were that unaware, let them use the probe. It would be agony for him but they would get nothing from his mind.\nSomething clicked behind him and he heard motion. Three people came into his field of vision and ranged themselves around the foot of the litter. They stared at him silently. Teg moved his attention across the three. The one on his left wore a dark singlesuit with open lapels. Male. He had the squarish face Teg had seen on some Gammu natives—small, beady eyes that stared straight through Teg. It was the face of an inquisitor, one who would not be moved by your agony. The Harkonnens had imported a lot of those in their day. Single-purpose types who could create pain without the slightest change of expression.\nThe one directly at Teg’s feet wore bulky clothing of black and", " in a sharp breath: an Ixian Probe!

Single-purpose types who could create pain without the slightest change of expression.\nThe one directly at Teg’s feet wore bulky clothing of black and gray similar to that of the escort but the hood was thrown back to reveal a bland face under closely cropped\ngray hair. The face gave nothing away and the clothing revealed little. No telling if this one was male or female. Teg recorded the face: wide forehead, square chin, large green eyes above a knife-ridged nose; a tiny mouth pursed around a moue of distaste.\nThe third member of this group held Teg’s attention longest: tall, a tailored black singlesuit with a severe black jacket over it. Perfectly fitted. Expensive. No decorations or insignia. Male definitely. The man affected boredom and this gave Teg a tag for him. Narrow, supercilious face, brown eyes, thin-lipped mouth. Bored, bored, bored! All of this in here was an unwarranted demand on his very important time. He had vital business elsewhere and these other two, these underlings, must be made to realize that.\nThat one, Teg thought, /s the official observer.\nThe bored one had been sent by the masters of this place to watch and report what he saw. Where was his datacase? Ahhhh, yes: There it was, propped against a wall behind him. Those cases were like a badge for such functionaries. On his inspection tour, Teg had seen these people walking the streets of Ysai and other Gammu cities. Small, thin cases. The more important the functionary, the smaller the case. This one’s case would barely contain a few dataspools and a tiny comeye. He would never be without an ‘eye to link him with his superiors. Thin case: This was an important functionary.\nTeg found himself wondering what the observer would say if Teg asked: “What will you tell them about my composure?”\nThe answer was already there on that bored face. He would not even answer. He was not here to answer. When this one leaves, Teg thought, he will walk with long strides. His attention will be on distances where only he knows what powers await him. He will slap that case against his leg to remind himself of his importance and to call the attention of these others to his badge of authority.\nThe bulky figure at Teg’s feet spoke, a compelling voice and definitely female in those vibrant tones.\n“See how he holds himself and watches us? Silence will not break him. | told you that before we entered. You are wasting our time and we do not have all that much time for such nonsense.”\nTeg stared at her. Something vaguely familiar in the voice. It had some of that compelling quality found in a Reverend Mother. Was that possible?\nThe heavy-faced Gammu type nodded. “You are right, Materly. But | do not give the orders here.”\nMaterly? Teg wondered. Name or title?\nBoth of them looked at the functionary. That one turned and bent to his datacase. He removed a small comeye from it and stood with the screen concealed from his companions and Teg. The ‘eye came alight with a green glow, which cast a sickly illumination over the observer’s features. His self- important smile vanished. He moved his lips silently, words formed only for someone on that ‘eye to see.\nTeg hid his ability to read lips. Anyone trained by the Bene Gesserit could read lips from almost any angle where they were visible. This man spoke a version of Old Galach.\n“It is the Bashar Teg for sure,” he said. “I have made identification.”\nThe green light danced on the functionary’s face while he stared into the ’eye. Whoever communicated with him was in agitated movement if that light meant anything.\nAgain, the functionary’s lips moved soundlessly: “None of us doubts that he has been conditioned against pain and | can smell shere on him. He will...”\nHe fell silent as the green light once more danced on his face.\n“I do not make excuses.” His lips shaped the Old Galach words with care. “You know we will do our best but | recommend that we pursue with vigor all other means of intercepting the ghola.”\nThe green light winked off.\nThe functionary clipped the ’eye to his waist, turned toward his companions and nodded once.\n“The T-probe,” the woman said.\nThey swung the probe over Teg’s head.\nShe called it a T-probe, Teg thought. He looked up at the hood as they brought it over him. There was no Ixian stamp on the thing.\nTeg experienced an odd sense of déja vu. He had the feeling that his own captivity here had occurred many times before. No single-incident déja vu, it was a deeply familiar recognition: the captive and the interrogators—these three ... the probe. He felt emptied. How could he know this moment? He had never personally employed a probe but he had studied their use thoroughly. The Bene Gesserit often used pain but relied mostly on Truthsayers. Even more than that, the Sisterhood believed that some equipment could put them too much under Ixian influence. It was an admission of weakness, a sign that they could not do without such despicable devices. Teg had even suspected there was something in this attitude of a hangover from the Butlerian Jihad, rebellion against machines that could copy out the essence of a human’s thoughts and memories.\nDéja vu!\nMentat logic demanded of him: How do I know this moment? He knew that he had never before been a captive. It was such a ridiculous switch of roles. The great Bashar Teg a captive? He could almost smile. But that deep sense of familiarity persisted.\nHis captors positioned the hood directly over his head and began releasing the medusa contacts one at a time, fixing them to his scalp. The functionary watched his companions work, producing small signs of impatience on an otherwise emotionless face.\nTeg moved his attention across the three faces. Which one of these would act the part of “friend”? Ahhhh, yes: the\none called Materly. Fascinating. Was it a form of Honored Matre? But neither of the others deferred to her as one would expect from what Teg had heard of those returning Lost Ones.\nThese were people from the Scattering, though— except possibly for the square-faced male in the brown singlesuit. Teg studied the woman with care: the mat of gray hair, the quiet composure in those widely spaced green eyes, the Slightly protruding chin with its sense of solidity and reliability. She had been chosen well for “friend.” Materly’s face was a map of respectability, someone you could trust. Teg saw a withdrawn quality in her, though. She was one who would also observe carefully to catch the moment when she must become involved. Surely, she was Bene Gesserit- trained at the very least.\nOr trained by the Honored Matres.\nThey finished attaching the contacts to his head. The Gammu type swung the probe’s console into position where all three could watch the display. The probe’s screen was concealed from Teg.\nThe woman removed Teg’s gag, confirming his judgment. She would be the source of comfort. He moved his tongue around in his mouth, restoring sensation. His face and chest still felt a bit numb from the stunner that had brought him down. How long ago had that been? But if he was to believe the silent words of the functionary, Duncan had escaped.\nThe Gammu type looked to the observer.\n“You may begin, Yar,” the functionary said.\nYar? Teg wondered. Curious name. Almost had a Tleilaxu sound. But Yar was not a Face Dancer... or a Tleilaxu Master. Too big for one and no stigmata of the other. As one trained by the Sisterhood, Teg felt confident of this.\nYar touched a control on the probe’s console.\nTeg heard himself grunt with pain. Nothing had prepared him for that much pain. They must have turned their devil’s machine to maximum for the first thrust. No question about\nit! They knew he was a Mentat. A Mentat could remove himself from some demands of flesh. But this was excruciating! He could not escape it. Agony shivered through his entire body, threatening to blank out his consciousness. Could shere shield him from this?\nThe pain diminished gradually and went away, leaving only quivering memories.\nAgain!\nHe thought suddenly that the spice agony must be like this for a Reverend Mother. Surely, there could be no greater pain. He fought to remain silent but heard himself grunting, moaning. Every ability he had ever learned, Mentat and Bene Gesserit, was called into play, keeping him from forming words, from begging for surcease, from promising to tell them anything if they would only stop.\nOnce more the agony receded and then surged back.\n“Enough!” That was the woman. Teg groped for her name. Materly?\nYar spoke in a sullen voice: “He’s loaded with shere, enough to last him a year at least.” He gestured at his console. “Blank.”\nTeg breathed in shallow gasps. The agony! It continued to increase despite Materly’s demand.\n“I said enough!” Materly snapped.\nSuch sincerity, Teg thought. He felt the pain recede, withdrawing as though every nerve were being removed from his body, pulled out like threads of the remembered agony.\n“It is wrong what we're doing,” Materly said. “This man is\n”\n“He is like any other man,” Yar said. “Shall | attach the special contact to his penis?”\n“Not while I’m here!” Materly said.\nTeg felt himself almost taken in by her sincerity. The last of the agony threads left his flesh and he lay there with a feeling that he had been suspended off the surface that\nsupported him. The sense of déja vu remained. He was here and not here. He had been here and he had not.\n“They will not like it if we fail,” Yar said. “Are you prepared to face them with another failure?”\nMaterly shook her head sharply. She bent over to bring her face into Teg’s line of vision through the medusa tangle of probe contacts. “Bashar, | am sorry for what we do. Believe me. This is not of my making. Please, | find all of this disgusting. Tell us what we need to know and let me make you comfortable.”\nTeg formed a smile for her. She was good! He shifted his gaze to the watchful functionary. “Tell your masters for me. She is very good at this.”\nBlood darkened the functionary’s face. He scowled. “Give him the maximum, Yar.” His voice was a clipped tenor without any of the deep training apparent in Materly’s voice.\n“Please!” Materly said. She straightened but kept her attention on Teg’s eyes", " not like it if we fail,” Yar said. “Are you prepared to face them with another failure?”\nMaterly shook her head sharply. She bent over to bring her face into Teg’s line of vision through the medusa tangle of probe contacts. “Bashar, | am sorry for what we do. Believe me. This is not of my making. Please, | find all of this disgusting. Tell us what we need to know and let me make you comfortable.”\nTeg formed a smile for her. She was good! He shifted his gaze to the watchful functionary. “Tell your masters for me. She is very good at this.”\nBlood darkened the functionary’s face. He scowled. “Give him the maximum, Yar.” His voice was a clipped tenor without any of the deep training apparent in Materly’s voice.\n“Please!” Materly said. She straightened but kept her attention on Teg’s eyes.\nTeg’s Bene Gesserit teachers had taught him that: “Watch the eyes! Observe how they change focus. As the focus moves outward, the awareness moves inward.”\nHe focused deliberately on her nose. It was not an ugly face. Rather distinctive. He wondered what the figure might be under those bulky clothes.\n“Yar!” That was the functionary.\nYar adjusted something on his console and pressed a switch.\nThe agony that surged through Teg now told him the previous level had, indeed, been lower. With the new pain came an odd clarity. Teg found himself almost capable of removing his awareness from this intrusion. All of that pain was happening to someone else. He had found a haven where little touched him. There was pain. Agony even. He accepted reports about these sensations. That was partly the shere’s doing, of course. He knew that and was thankful.\nMaterly’s voice intruded: “I think we’re losing him. Better ease off.”\nAnother voice responded but the sound faded into stillness before Teg could identify the words. He realized abruptly that he had no anchor point for his awareness. Stillness! He thought he heard his heart beating rapidly in fear but he was not sure. All was stillness, profound quiet with nothing behind it.\nAm I still alive?\nHe found a heartbeat then, but no certainty that it was his own. Thump-thump! Thump-thump! It was a sensation of movement and no sound. He could not fix the source.\nWhat is happening to me?\nWords blazoned in brilliant white against a black background played across his visual centers:\n“I’m back to one-third.”\n“Leave it at that. See if we can read him through his physical reactions.”\n“Can he still hear us?”\n“Not consciously.”\nNone of Teg’s instructions had told him a probe could do its evil work in the presence of shere. But they called this a T-probe. Could bodily reactions provide a clue to suppressed thoughts? Were there revelations to be explored by physical means?\nAgain, words played against Teg’s visual centers: “Is he still isolated?”\n“Completely.”\n“Make sure. Take him a little deeper.”\nTeg tried to lift his awareness above his fears.\nI must remain in control!\nWhat might his body reveal if he had no contact with it? He could imagine what they were doing and his mind registered panic but his flesh could not feel it.\nIsolate the subject. Give him nowhere to seat his identity.\nWho had said that? Someone. The sense of déja vu returned in full force.\nlam a Mentat, he reminded himself. My mind and its workings are my center. He possessed experiences and memories upon which a center could rely.\nPain returned. Sounds. Loud! Much too loud!\n“He’s hearing again.” That was Yar.\n“How can that be?” The functionary’s tenor.\n“Perhaps you've set it too low.” Materly.\nTeg tried to open his eyes. The lids would not obey. He remembered then. They had called it a T-probe. This was no Ixian device. This was something from the Scattering. He could identify where it took over his muscles and senses. It was like another person sharing his flesh, preempting his own reactive patterns. He allowed himself to follow the workings of this machine’s intrusions. It was a hellish device! It could order him to blink, fart, gasp, shit, piss— anything. It could command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior. He was relegated to the role of observer.\nOdors assailed him—disgusting odors. He would not command himself to frown but he thought of frowning. That was sufficient. These odors had been elicited by the probe. It was playing his senses, learning them.\n“Do you have enough to read him?” The functionary’s tenor.\n“He’s still hearing us!” Yar.\n“Damn all Mentats!” Materly.\n“Dit, Dat, and Dot,” Teg said, naming the puppets of the Winter Show from his childhood on long-ago Lernaeus.\n“He’s talking!” The functionary.\nTeg felt his awareness being blocked off by the machine. Yar was doing something at the console. Still, Teg knew his own Mentat logic had told him something vital: These three were puppets. Only the puppet masters were important.\nHow the puppets moved—that told you what the puppet masters were doing.\nThe probe continued to intrude. Despite the force being applied, Teg felt his awareness matching the thing. It was learning him but he was also learning it.\nHe understood now. The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified, tagged for Yar to call up when needed. An organic chain of responses existed within Teg. The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him. The shere and his Mentat resistance shunted the searchers away from his memories but everything else could be copied.\nIt will not think like me, he reassured himself.\nThe machine would not be the same as his nerves and flesh. It would not have Teg-memories or Teg-experiences. It had not been born of woman. It had never traveled down a birth canal and emerged into this astonishing universe.\nPart of Teg’s awareness applied a memory marker, telling him that this observation revealed something about the ghola.\nDuncan was decanted from an axlotl tank.\nThe observation came to Teg with a sudden sharp biting of acid on his tongue.\nThe T-probe again!\nTeg allowed himself to flow through a multiple simultaneous awareness. He followed the T-probe’s workings and continued to explore this observation about the ghola, all the while listening for Dit, Dat, and Dot. The three puppets were oddly silent. Yes, waiting for their T- probe to complete its task.\nThe ghola: Duncan was an extension of cells that had been born of a woman impregnated by a man.\nMachine and ghola!\nObservation: The machine cannot share that birth experience except in a remotely vicarious way sure to miss important personal nuances.\nJust as it was missing other things in him right now.\nThe T-probe was replaying smells. With each induced odor, memories revealed their presence in Teg’s mind. He felt the great speed of the T-probe but his own awareness lived outside of that headlong rushing search, able to entangle him for as long as he desired in the memories being called up here.\nThere!\nThat was the hot wax he had spilled on his left hand when only fourteen and a student in the Bene Gesserit school. He recalled school and laboratory as though his only existence were there at this moment. The school is attached to Chapter House. By being admitted here, Teg knew he had the blood of Siona in his veins. No prescient could track him here.\nHe saw the lab and smelled the wax—a compound of artificial esters and the natural product of bees kept by failed Sisters and their helpers. He turned his memory to a moment when he watched bees and people at their labors in the apple orchards.\nThe workings of the Bene Gesserit social structure appeared so complicated until you saw through to the necessities: food, clothing, warmth, communication, learning, protection from enemies (a subset of the survival drive). Bene Gesserit survival took some adjustments before it could be understood. They did not procreate for the sake of humankind in general. No unmonitored racial involvement! They procreated to extend their own powers, to continue the Bene Gesserit, deeming that a sufficient service to humankind. Perhaps it was. Procreative motivation went deep and the Sisterhood was so thorough.\nA new smell assailed him.\nHe recognized the wet wool of his clothing as he came into the command pod after the Battle of Ponciard. The smell filled his nostrils and elicited the ozone of the pod’s instruments, the sweat of the other occupants. Wool! The\nSisterhood had always thought it a bit odd of him, the way he preferred natural fabrics and shunned the synthetics turned out in captive factories.\nNo more did he care for chairdogs.\n| don’t like the smells of oppression in any form.\nDid these puppets—Dit, Dat, and Dot—know how oppressed they were?\nMentat logic sneered at him. Were not wool fabrics also a product of captive factories?\nIt was different.\nPart of him argued otherwise. Synthetics could be stored almost indefinitely. Look how long they had endured in the nullentropy bins of the Harkonnen no-globe.\n“I still prefer woolens and cottons!”\nSo be it!\n“But how did | come by such a preference?”\nIt is an Atreides prejudice. You inherited it.\nTeg shunted the smells aside and concentrated on the total movement of the intrusive probe. He found presently that he could anticipate the thing. It was a new muscle. He allowed himself to flex it while he continued to examine the induced memories for valuable insights.\n| sit outside my mother’s door on Lernaeus.\nTeg removed part of his awareness and watched the scene: age eleven. He is talking to a small Bene Gesserit acolyte who came as part of the escort for Somebody Important. The acolyte is a tiny thing with red-blond hair and a doll’s face. Upturned nose, green-gray eyes. The SI is a black-robed Reverend Mother of truly ancient appearance. She has gone behind that nearby door with Teg’s mother. The acolyte, who is named Carlana, is trying her fledgling Skills on the young son of the house.\nBefore Carlana utters twenty words, Miles Teg recognizes the pattern. She is trying to pry information out of him! This was one of the first lessons in delicate dissembling taught by his mother. There were, after all, people who might\nquestion a young boy about a Reverend Mother’s household, hoping thereby to gain salable information. There is always a market for data about Reverend Mothers.\nHis mother explained: “You judge the questioner and fit your responses according to the susceptibilities.” None of this would have served against a full Reverend Mother, but against an acolyte, especially this one!\nFor Carlana, he produces an appearance of coy reluctance. Carlana has an inflated view of her own attractions. He allows her to overcome his reluctance after a suitable marshaling of her forces. What she gets is a handful of lies, which, if she ever repeats them to the SI behind that closed door, are sure to win Carlana a severe censuring if not something more painful.\nWords from Dit, Dat, and Dot: “| think we have him now.”\nTeg recognized Yar’s voice yanking him out of old memories. “Fit your responses according to the susceptibilities.” Teg heard the words in his mother’s voice.\nPuppets.\nPuppet masters.\nThe"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_1aaf66b611d4586068dfad2eed62f28172bd8d9403aa493ce2b660391edde35e_v2"}
