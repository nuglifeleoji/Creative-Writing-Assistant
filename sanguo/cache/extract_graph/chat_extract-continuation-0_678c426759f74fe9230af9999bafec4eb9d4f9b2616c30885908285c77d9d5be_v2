�潘璋领三千兵，尽打白旗，往汉阳接应董袭。六队船只各自分路去了。却令黄盖安排火船，使小卒驰书约曹操，今夜来降。一面拨战船四只，随于黄盖船后接应。第一队领兵军官韩当，第二队领兵军官周泰，第三队领兵军官蒋钦，第四队领兵军官陈武：四队各引战船三百只，前面各摆列火船二十只。周瑜自与程普在大艨艟上督战，徐盛、丁奉为左右护卫，只留鲁肃共阚泽及众谋士守寨。程普见周瑜调军有法，甚相敬服。却说孙权差使命持兵符至，说已差陆逊为先锋，直抵蕲、黄地面进兵，吴侯自为后应。瑜又差人西山放火炮，南屏山举号旗。各各准备停当，只等黄昏举动。\n\n    话分两头。且说刘玄德在夏口专候孔明回来，忽见一队船到，乃是公子刘琦自来探听消息。玄德请上敌楼坐定，说：“东南风起多时，子龙去接孔明，至今不见到，吾心甚忧。”小校遥指樊口港上：“一帆风送扁舟来到，必军师也。”玄德与刘琦下楼迎接。须臾船到，孔明、子龙登岸。玄德大喜。问候毕，孔明曰：“且无暇告诉别事。前者所约军马战船，皆已办否？”玄德曰：“收拾久矣，只候军师调用。”\n\n    孔明便与玄德、刘琦升帐坐定，谓赵云曰：“子龙可带三千军马，渡江径取乌林小路，拣树木芦苇密处埋伏。今夜四更已后，曹操必然从那条路奔走。等他军马过，就半中间放起火来。虽然不杀他尽绝，也杀一半。”云曰：“乌林有两条路：一条通南郡，一条取荆州。不知向那条路来？”孔明曰：“南郡势迫，曹操不敢往；必来荆州，然后大军投许昌而去。”云领计去了。又唤张飞曰：“翼德可领三千兵渡江，截断彝陵这条路，去葫芦谷口埋伏。曹操不敢走南彝陵，必望北彝陵去。来日雨过，必然来埋锅造饭。只看烟起，便就山边放起火来。虽然不捉得曹操，翼德这场功料也不小。”飞领计去了。又唤糜竺、糜芳、刘封三人各驾船只，绕江剿擒败军，夺取器械。三人领计去了。孔明起身，谓公子刘琦曰：“武昌一望之地。最为紧要。公子便请回，率领所部之兵，陈于岸口。操一败必有逃来者，就而擒之，却不可轻离城郭。”刘琦便辞玄德、孔明去了。孔明谓玄德曰：“主公可于樊口屯兵，凭高而望，坐看今夜周郎\n######################\nOutput:",
