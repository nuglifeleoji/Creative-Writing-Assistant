叶锋没想到他会这么说，但也下意识的回想起自己在关禁闭的那段时间，心中所思所想又何尝不是妻女呢？\n\n    轻叹一声，“好吧。如果你改变主意了，随时来找我。就这样。”说完，他站起身，毫不拖泥带水的走了。\n------------\n\n第六十二章 老师她摸我\n\n    蓝潇没有急着离开，继续坐在那里喝着咖啡。他怎能让蓝轩宇去参军啊！参军意味着什么？\n\n    参军首先要进行的，就是家庭背景、自身情况的严格审查。而蓝轩宇的来历如何？经得起查吗？答案当然是否定的。\n\n    蓝轩宇的出生记录本来就是他找人做出来的啊！这是个蛋生的孩子啊！\n\n    所以，无论如何，他都不会让蓝轩宇去参军的。他现在只是希望儿子能健康、平安，这就足够了。\n\n    “蓝轩宇！”\n\n    听到背后这个声音传来，蓝轩宇连脚步都没停下，表情也有些垮。\n\n    叶灵瞳三两步追到他身后，“你干嘛？有没有礼貌？我叫你呢。”\n\n    听着她很是不满的声音，蓝轩宇没好气的道：“你有完没完啊！你是一班的，我是二班的。你没事儿老来找我麻烦干嘛？我好欺负是不是？”\n\n    叶灵瞳顿时气结，“我就那么让你讨厌？”\n\n    蓝轩宇这才停下脚步看着她道：“要是每次见到我都要欺负你，你讨不讨厌我？你就是这样的。哼！”说完，他转身就走。\n\n    叶灵瞳被他说的愣了愣，但转而大怒，朝着他背后大叫道：“我欺负你？每次受伤的都是我？我怎么欺负你了？你要不要脸？蓝轩宇，你给我等着！咱们高能少年班测试上见！”\n\n    蓝轩宇有点郁闷，每次遇到叶灵瞳都这样，可学校就这么大，一年级也就这么几个班，想要避开又谈何容易啊？倒是她不在那几个月最是清闲，也少了许多麻烦。\n\n    他倒不是怕了叶灵瞳，只是觉得她有些麻烦。\n\n    秋雨馨早早地就来了，看到蓝轩宇脸上自然就流露出了笑容。\n\n    “秋老师好。”蓝轩宇很有礼貌的向她问好。\n\n    秋雨馨道：“假期准备的如何？”\n\n    蓝轩宇笑了笑，道：“挺好的。秋老师，我十四级了。”\n\n    “好、好！”蓝轩宇的魂力虽然提升不算太快，和一般的先天满魂力相比算是慢的，但总算提升速度还是在增加的，这就是好现象了。更何况，这孩子的整体素质也不能完全用魂力来衡量。\n\n    “你待会儿不用参加新学年开学典礼了。今天咱们天罗学院本院的考官就来了。我稍候就带你过去。”\n\n    “哦，好。”蓝轩�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
