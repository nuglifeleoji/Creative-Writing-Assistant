，并取得了各常任理事国的一致通过，于次年开始执行。面壁计划的核心内容，是由经过各常任理事国选定和推举的四位面壁者进行完全封闭的个人思考，制定并执行对抗三体世界入侵的战略计划，以避开智子对人类世界无所不在的监视，从而实现战略的隐蔽性。联合国推出了相应的面壁法案以保证面壁者制定和执行计划的特权。\n　　“面壁计划至今已经进行了二百零五年，其间，有过长达一个多世纪的停顿期。在这期间，计划的领导权由原行星防御理事会移交到现太阳系舰队联席会议。\n　　“面壁计划的产生有特定的历史背景。当时，三体危机刚刚出现，面对这个人类历史上史无前例的毁灭性危机，国际社会陷入了空前的恐惧和绝望中，面壁计划正是在这样的状态下诞生的，它不是理智的选择，而是绝望的挣扎。\n　　“历史事实证明，面壁计划是一个完全失败的战略计划。毫不夸张地说，它是人类社会作为一个整体，有史以来所做出的最幼稚、最愚蠢的举动。面壁者被赋予空前的、不受任何法律监督的权力，甚至被赋予欺骗国际社会的自由，这违背了人类社会最基本的道德和法律准则。\n　　“在面壁计划的执行过程中，大量的战略资源被没有意义地消耗，面壁者弗雷德里克。泰勒的量子舰队计划已被证明没有任何战略意义，而面壁者雷迪亚兹的水星坠落连锁反应计划，即使以目前人类的能力也根本无法实现。同时，这两个计划都是犯罪，泰勒企图攻击并消灭地球舰队，雷迪亚兹的企图则更加邪恶，竟然把整个地球生命世界作为人质。\n　　“另外两位面壁者也同样令人失望。面壁者希恩斯的思维提升计划目前还没有暴露出其真实的战略意图，但其初步阶段的成果——思想钢印，在太空军中的使用也是犯罪，它严重地侵犯了思想自由，而后者是人类文明存在和进步的基础。\n　　至于面壁者罗辑，他先是不负责任地用公共资源为自己营造享乐生话，其后又以可笑的神秘主义举动哗众举宠。\n　　“我们认为，随着人类力量的决定性增强和对战争主动权的把握，面壁计划已经没有意义，现在是结束这一历史遗留问题的合适时间。我们建议舰队联席会议立刻中止面壁计划，同时废除联合国面壁法案。\n　　“特此提交本提案。”\n　　主席把提案文本缓缓放下，扫视了一下会场说：“现在开始对太阳系舰队联席会议649
