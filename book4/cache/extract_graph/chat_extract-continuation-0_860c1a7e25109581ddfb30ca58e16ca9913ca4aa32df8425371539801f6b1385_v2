\n　　提起结婚的事，这才使高兴得晕晕乎乎的孙玉厚脑子凉了下来。他马上想到，结婚就得花钱！可他手上没几个钱，又到哪里去转借呢？尽管人家女方不要财礼，但他不能连几身衣服都不给人家娃娃缝。两个新人的衣服被褥和零七碎八下来，三五十块钱根本不顶事。再说，他也不能悄无声息地给少安娶媳妇。这是他为自己亲爱的儿子办喜事呀！当年他为自己的弟弟办事，在那么困难的年月里，都咬着牙办得有声有响，体体面面；现在他为自己的孩子办事，那就是拼着老命，也不能让世人笑话！虽说现在不让雇吹手，但他要备酒饭，待亲朋！把事办得红红火火，热热闹闹！没钱？借！ \n　　可是，办喜事少说也得借二百元。这样一笔数字不小的钱，他向谁去借呢？ \n　　昨晚上睡觉的时候，他和少安妈几乎一夜没合眼。老两口高兴一阵，又忧愁一阵，商量借钱和待客的事。他们觉得，放在春节好——把喜事也办了，一家人把年也过了。 \n　　两个人先详细地计算了粮和钱的费用。这两样主要的东西，都得开口问别人借。家里的口粮大部分是粗粮，拿不到席面上。当然，猪肉不要买了，把自己家里那口猪杀掉——实际上不是不买肉，而是今年卖不成肉了。 \n　　粮食他们先没顾上考虑向谁家借。两个人先说借钱的事。他们约摸全村大概有几户人家能有这笔钱。书记田福堂不好开口。大队会计田海民也能拿得出来，但海民媳妇银花连公公田万有都不肯给借钱，怎么可能给他们借呢？金俊武说不定有一点钱，可他拖家带口的，不好为难金家湾的这个强人。金俊山和他儿子金成都有存款，但他们和这父子俩交情不深，根本开不了口。当然，钱最宽裕的是公派教师姚淑芳和她在县百货公司当售货员的丈夫金光明。但由于他们的玉亭在文化革命开始时斗争过人家弟兄们，结下了仇恨，借钱的事连想也不能想…… \n　　老两口算来算去，最后还是一致认为：只能向金俊海家借这笔钱。但这也够让他们难肠了。当然，只要他们开口，估计这家人不会拒绝的。他们太麻烦人家了！早年间，玉亭成家后，他们没地方住，白白在人家门上住了好几年。以后虽说他们把家搬到了这里，但少平和兰香晚上没地方住，还不是在人家那里借宿！再说，平时金秀对兰香，金波对少平，经常拿吃�\n######################\nOutput:",
