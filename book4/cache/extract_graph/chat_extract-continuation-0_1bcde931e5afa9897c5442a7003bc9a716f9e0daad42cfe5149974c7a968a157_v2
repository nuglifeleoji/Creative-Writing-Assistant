万一师傅有个三长两短，他自己就直接可以上手——跑外交到时能另想办法哩……所有这些还都是后话。要等到他把那三千块款贷回来，另外再筹借一千块钱，才能进行下一步的工作……几天以后，少安就一身“农民企业家”的装扮，从家里起身到原北县办那三千块贷款。因为这是去外地办事，要显出一点“气派”来，秀莲出主意给他买了一顶鸭舌帽，还把那个带带的黑人造革大皮包，换成了箱式手提包。另外，皱巴巴的西装口袋上，别了一支钢笔，笔帽在胸前银光闪闪，这副模样，看起来完全象个生意十分红火的“企业家”了。孙少安兴致勃勃走向了外县……这个时候，孙玉厚老汉却心神不宁地走出走进，一副惶惶不可终日的样子。老汉焦急地等待铜城二小子的一封信。 \n　　少安两口子并不知道，他们的父母亲也在为他们砖场重新上马而处于无比的焦灼之中。 \n　　说实话，当孙玉厚老汉听说儿子的砖场又有指望，一颗心也在胸膛里激动得乱跳弹哩。 \n　　儿子的砖场例塌到现在，一年时光中，玉厚老汉的头发完全急白了。归根结底，儿子的灾难，也就是他的灾难。虽然他们已经分了家，可他们永远是一家人啊！他当年坚持分家，还不是为了让亲爱的儿子过好光景？ \n　　儿子决定扩大砖场，弄了村里一群人来干活，还搞了那个铺排的“点火仪式”，老汉当时害怕得浑身索索发抖，他心中莫名地产生一种恐惧。结果，他在冥冥中的恐惧眼看着变成了事实，灾祸劈头盖脑就压下来了……砖场垮了，他早年间就未能给儿子帮什么大忙，甚至连累了孩子半辈子，现在，孩子有了这么大的灾事，他只有干着急而给他们凑不上一点劲！ \n　　在他的一生中，没有哪一年比这一年更难熬了。没有！无论是当年给玉亭娶媳妇，还是那年女婿被“劳教”，比起儿子的这场灾难，那都是些屁事！ \n　　一年里，他常常愁得整夜合不住眼。少安他妈也一样，说起这愁肠，就忍不住落泪。老两口只能相对无言，长吁短叹，他不知在心里祈祷过多少次，让万能的老天爷发发慈慈，把他儿子从灾难中解救出来。他甚至怀疑：是不是因为少安虚岁二十四“本命年”没有系避邪的红裤带，才引起了这场灾祸？完全可能哩！唉，儿子说这是迷信，没当一回事，结果…… \n　　现在，当儿子告诉他说能在外县贷三千块款后，孙玉厚老汉立刻感到，儿子“本命年”未系红裤带所遭受的命\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a farmer entrepreneur who
