Let him suspect poison.\n“Treachery!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. “He’s poisoned me! | do feel poison in my arm!”\nPaul dropped his cloak of silence, said: “Only a little acid to counter the soporific on the Emperor’s blade.”\nFeyd-Rautha matched Paul’s cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute. His eyes glared rage behind the knife.\nPaul shifted his crysknife to his left hand, matching his opponent. Again, they circled, probing.\nFeyd-Rautha began closing the space between them, edging in, knife held high, anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw. He feinted right and under, and they were pressed against each other, knife hands gripped, straining.\nPaul, cautious of Feyd-Rautha’s right hip where he Suspected a poison flip-dart, forced the turn to the right. He almost failed to see the needle point flick out beneath the belt line. A shift and a giving in Feyd- Rautha’s motion warned him. The tiny point missed Paul’s flesh by the barest fraction.\nOn the left hip!\nTreachery within treachery within treachery, Paul reminded himself. Using Bene Gesserit-trained muscles, he sagged to catch a reflex in Feyd-Rautha, but the necessity of avoiding the tiny point jutting\nfrom his opponent’s hip threw Paul off just enough that he missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to the floor, Feyd-Rautha on top.\n“You see it there on my hip?” Feyd-Rautha whispered. “Your death, fool.” And he began twisting himself around, forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer. “It’ll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you. There’ll be never a trace left to detect!”\nPaul strained, hearing the silent screams in his mind, his cell-stamped ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to save himself.\n“I will not say it!” Paul gasped.\nFeyd-Rautha gaped at him, caught in the merest fraction of hesitation. It was enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponent’s leg muscles, and their positions were reversed. Feyd- Rautha lay partly underneath with right hip high, unable to turn because of the tiny needle point caught against the floor beneath him.\nPaul twisted his left hand free, aided by the lubrication of blood from his arm, thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha’s Jaw. The point slid home into the brain. Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back, still held partly on his side by the needle imbedded in the floor.\nBreathing deeply to restore his calm, Paul pushed himself away and got to his feet. He stood over the body, knife in hand, raised his eyes with deliberate Slowness to look across the room at the Emperor.\n“Majesty,” Paul said, “your force is reduced by one more. Shall we now shed sham and pretense? Shall\nwe now discuss what must be? Your daughter wed to me and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne.”\nThe Emperor turned, looked at Count Fenring. The Count met his stare—gray eyes against green. The thought lay there clearly between them, their association so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance.\nKill this upstart for me, the Emperor was saying. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now...you know the way of it. Kill him.\nSlowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.\n“Do it!” the Emperor hissed.\nThe Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in the Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this Atreides youth.\n/ could kill him, Fenring thought—and he knew this for a truth.\nSomething in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he glimpsed briefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul—a way of hiding from the youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate.\nPaul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled, understood at last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of prescience. Fenring was one of the might-have-beens, an almost-Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern—\na eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion. A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced.\nFenring, reading Paul’s emotion, said, “Majesty, | must refuse.”\nRage overcame Shaddam IV. He took two short steps through the entourage, cuffed Fenring viciously across the jaw.\nA dark flush spread up and over the Count’s face. He looked directly at the Emperor, spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis: “We have been friends, Majesty. What | do now is out of friendship. | shall forget that you struck me.”\nPaul cleared his throat, said: “We were speaking of the throne, Majesty.”\nThe Emperor whirled, glared at Paul. “I sit on the throne!” he barked.\n“You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus,” Paul said.\n“| put down my arms and came here on your word of bond!” the Emperor shouted. “You dare threaten\n“Your person is safe in my presence,” Paul said. “An Atreides promised it. Muad’Dib, however, sentences you to your prison planet. But have no fear, Majesty. | will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my disposal. It shall become a garden world, full of gentle things.”\nAs the hidden import of Paul’s words grew in the Emperor’s mind, he glared across the room at Paul. “Now we see true motives,” he sneered.\n“Indeed,” Paul said.\n“And what of Arrakis?” the Emperor asked. “Another garden world full of gentle things?”\n“The Fremen have the word of Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “There will be flowing water here open to the Sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis...and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: ‘God created Arrakis to train the faithful.” One cannot go against the word of God.”\nThe old Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her own view of the hidden meaning in Paul’s words now. She glimpsed the jihad and said: “You cannot loose these people upon the universe!”\n“You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar!” Paul snapped.\n“You cannot,” she whispered.\n“You're a Truthsayer,” Paul said. “Review your words.” He glanced at the Princess Royal, back to the Emperor. “Best be done quickly, Majesty.”\nThe Emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter. She touched his arm, spoke soothingly: “For this | was trained, Father.”\nHe took a deep breath.\n“You cannot stay this thing,” the old Truthsayer muttered.\nThe Emperor straightened, standing stiffly with a look of remembered dignity. “Who will negotiate for you, kinsman?” he asked.\nPaul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy- lidded, standing with Chani in a squad of Fedaykin guards. He crossed to them, stood looking down at Chani.\n“I know the reasons,” Chani whispered. “If it must be...Usul.”\nPaul, hearing the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. “My Sihaya need fear nothing, ever,” he whispered. He dropped his arm, faced his mother. “You will negotiate for me, Mother, with Chani by your side. She has wisdom and sharp eyes. And it is wisely said that no one bargains tougher than a Fremen. She will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of her sons to be, what they will need. Listen to her.”\nJessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son, put down a shudder. “What are your instructions?” she asked.\n“The Emperor’s entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry,” he said.\n“Entire?” She was shocked almost speechless.\n“He is to be stripped. l'Il want an earldom and CHOAM directorship for Gurney Halleck, and him in the fief of Caladan. There will be titles and attendant power for every surviving Atreides man, not excepting the lowliest trooper.”\n“What of the Fremen?” Jessica asked.\n“The Fremen are mine,” Paul said. “What they receive shall be dispensed by Muad’Dib. It’ll begin with Stilgar as Governor on Arrakis, but that can wait.”\n“And for me?” Jessica asked.\n“Is there something you wish?”\n“Perhaps Caladan,” she said, looking at Gurney. “I’m not certain. I’ve become too much the Fremen... and the Reverend Mother. | need a time of peace and stillness in which to think.”\n“That you shall have,” Paul said, “and anything else that Gurney or | can give you.”\nJessica nodded, feeling suddenly old and tired. She looked at Chani. “And for the royal concubine?”\n“No title for me,” Chani whispered. “Nothing. | beg of you.”\nPaul stared down into her eyes, remembering her suddenly as she had stood once with little Leto in her arms, their child now dead in this violence. “I Swear to you now,” he whispered, “that you’ll need no title. That woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing and we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the Landsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of desire.”\n“So you say now,” Chani said. She glanced across the room at the tall princess.\n“Do you know so little of my son?” Jessica whispered. “See that princess standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else.” A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. “Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine—never to know a moment of tenderness\nfrom the man to whom she’s bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine—history will call us Wives.”\nAPPENDIXES\nAPPENDIX I: THE ECOLOGY OF DUNE\nBeyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase.
