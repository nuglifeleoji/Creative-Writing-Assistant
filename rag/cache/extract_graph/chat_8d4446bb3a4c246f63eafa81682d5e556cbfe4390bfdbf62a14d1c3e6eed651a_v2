We would like you to witness a small demonstration of our powers.” Interlude of sexual demonstration followed by a display of Honred Matre physical speed. Then— withdrawal of melange and injection of the adrenaline-based substitute laced with a hypnodrug. In that hypothetical trance, the Reverend Mother was sexually imprinted.\nThat coupled to the selective agony of melange withdrawal (Bell suggested) might make the victim deny her Origins.\nFates help us! Were the original Honored Matres all Reverend Mothers? Do we dare test this hypothesis on ourselves? What can we learn of this from that pair in the no-ship?\nTwo sources of information lay there under the Sisterhood’s watchful eyes but the key had yet to be found.\nWoman and man no longer just breeding partners, no longer a comfort and support to each other. Something new has been added. The stakes have been escalated.\nIn the comeye record playing at the worktable, Murbella said something that caught the Mother Superior’s full attention.\n“We Honored Matres did this to ourselves! Can’t blame anyone else.”\n“You hear that?” Bellonda demanded.\nOdrade shook her head sharply, wanting all of her attention on this exchange.\n“You can’t say the same about me,” Idaho objected.\n“That’s an empty excuse,” Murbella accused. “So you were conditioned by the Tleilaxu to snare the first Imprinter you encountered!”\n“And to kill her,” Idaho corrected. “That’s what they intended.”\n“But you didn’t even try to kill me. Not that you could have.”\n“That’s when...” Idaho broke off with an involuntary glance at the recording comeyes.\n“What was he about to say there?” Bellonda pounced. “We must find out!”\nBut Odrade continued her silent observation of the captive pair. Murbella demonstrated a surprising insight. “You think you caught me through some accident in which you were not involved?”\n“Exactly.”\n“But | see something in you that accepted all of it! You didn’t just go along with your conditioning. You performed to your limits.”\nAn inward look filmed Idaho’s eyes. He tipped his head back, stretching his chest muscles.\n“That’s a Mentat expression!” Bellonda accused.\nAll of Odrade’s analysts suggested this but they had yet to wrest an admission from Idaho. If he was a Mentat, why withhold that information?\nBecause of the other things implied by such abilities. He fears us and rightly so.\nMurbella spoke with a sneer. “You improvised and improved on what the Tleilaxu did to you. There was something in you that made no complaint whatsoever!”\n“That’s how she deals with her own guilt feelings,” Bellonda said. “She has to believe it’s true or Idaho would not have been able to trap her.”\nOdrade pursed her lips. The projection showed Idaho amused. “Perhaps it was the same for both of us.”\n“You can’t blame the Tleilaxu and | can’t blame the Honored Matres.”\nTamalane entered the workroom and sank into her chairdog beside Bellonda. “I see it has your interest, too.” She gestured at the projected figures.\nOdrade shut down the projector.\n“I’ve been inspecting our axlotl tanks,” Tamalane said. “That damned Scytale has withheld vital information.”\n“There’s no flaw in our first ghola, is there?” Bellonda demanded.\n“Nothing our Suks can find.”\nOdrade spoke in a mild tone: “Scytale has to keep some bargaining chips.”\nBoth sides shared a fantasy: Scytale was paying the Bene Gesserit for rescue from the Honored Matres and sanctuary on Chapterhouse. But every Reverend Mother who studied him knew something else drove the last Tleilaxu Master.\nClever, clever, the Bene Tleilax. Far more clever than we suspected. And they have dirtied us with their axlotl tanks. The very word “tank”—another of their deceptions. We pictured containers of warmed amniotic fluid, each tank the focus of complex machinery to duplicate (in a subtle, discrete and controllable way) the workings of the womb. The tank is there all right! But look at what it contains.\nThe Tleilaxu solution was direct: Use the original. Nature already had worked it out over the eons. All the Bene Tleilax need do was add their own control system, their own way of replicating information stored in the cell.\n“The Language of God,” Scytale called it. Language of Shaitan was more appropriate.\nFeedback. The cell directed its own womb. That was more or less what a fertilized ovum did anyway. The Tleilaxu merely refined it.\nA sigh escaped Odrade, bringing sharp glances from her companions. Does Mother Superior have new troubles?\nScytale’s revelations trouble me. And what those revelations have done to us. Oh, how we recoiled from the “debasement.” Then, rationalizations. And we knew they were rationalizations! “If there is no other way. If this produces the gholas we need so desperately. Volunteers probably can be found.” Were found! Volunteers!\n“You're woolgathering!” Tamalane grumbled. She glanced at Bellonda, started to say something and thought better of it.\nBellonda’s face went soft-bland, a frequent accompaniment to her darker moods. Her voice came out little more than a guttural whisper. “I strongly urge that we eliminate Idaho. And as for that Tleilaxu monster...”\n“Why do you make such a suggestion with a euphemism?” Tamalane demanded.\n“Kill him then! And the Tleilaxu should be subjected to every persuasion we—”\n“Stop it, both of you!” Odrade ordered.\nShe pressed both palms briefly against her forehead and, staring at the bow window, saw icy rain out there. Weather Control was making more mistakes. You couldn’t blame them, but there was nothing humans hated more than the unpredictable. “We want it natural!” Whatever that means.\nWhen such thoughts came over her, Odrade longed for an existence confined to the order that pleased her: an occasional walk in the orchards. She enjoyed them in all seasons. A quiet evening with friends, the give and take of probing conversations with those for whom she felt warmth. Affection? Yes. The Mother Superior dared much—even love of companions. And good meals with drinks chosen for their enhancement of flavors. She wanted that, too. How fine it was to play upon the palate. And later... yes, later—a warm bed with a gentle companion sensitive to her needs as she was sensitive to his.\nMost of this could not be, of course. Responsibilities! What an enormous word. How it burned.\n“I’m getting hungry,” Odrade said. “Shall | order lunch served here?”\nBellonda and Tamalane stared at her. “It’s only half past eleven,” Tamalane complained.\n“Yes or no?” Odrade insisted.\nBellonda and Tamalane exchanged a private look. “As you wish,” Bellonda said.\nThere was a saying in the Bene Gesserit (Odrade knew) that the Sisterhood ran smoother when Mother Superior’s stomach was satisfied. That had just tipped the scales.\nOdrade keyed the intercom to her private kitchen. “Lunch for three, Duana. Something special. You choose.”\nLunch, when it came, featured a dish Odrade especially enjoyed, a veal casserole. Duana displayed a delicate touch with herbs, a bit of rosemary in the veal, the vegetables not overcooked. Superb.\nOdrade savored every bite. The other two plodded through the meal, spoon-to-mouth, spoon-to-mouth.\nIs this one of the reasons | am Mother Superior and they are not?\nWhile an acolyte cleared away the remains of lunch, Odrade turned to one of her favorite questions: “What is the gossip in the common rooms and among the acolytes?”\nShe remembered in her own acolyte days how she had hung on the words of the older women, expecting great truths and getting mostly small talk about Sister So-and-so or the latest problems of Proctor X. Occasionally, though, the barriers came down and important data flowed.\n“Too many acolytes talk of wanting to go out in our Scattering,” Tamalane rasped. “Sinking ships and rats, | Say.”\n“There’s a great interest in Archives lately,” Bellonda said. “Sisters who know better come looking for confirmation—whether such and so acolyte has a heavy Siona gene-mark.”\nOdrade found this interesting. Their common Atreides ancestor from the Tyrant’s eons, Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides, had imparted to her descendants this ability that hid them from prescient searchers. Every person walking openly on Chapterhouse shared that ancestral protection.\n“A heavy mark?” Odrade asked. “Do they doubt that the ones in question are protected?”\n“They want reassurance,” Bellonda growled. “And now may | return to Idaho? He has the genetic mark and he does not. It worries me. Why do some of his cells not have the Siona marker? What were the Tleilaxu doing?”\n“Duncan knows the danger and he’s not suicidal,” Odrade said.\n“We don’t know what he is,” Bellonda complained.\n“Probably a Mentat, and we all know what that could mean,” Tamalane said.\n“| understand why we keep Murbella,” Bellonda said. “Valuable information. But Idaho and Scytale.. .”\n“That’s enough!” Odrade snapped. “Watchdogs can bark too long!”\nBellonda accepted this grudgingly. Watchdogs. Their Bene Gesserit term for constant monitoring by Sisters to see that you did not fall into shallow ways. Very trying to acolytes but just another part of life to Reverend Mothers.\nOdrade had explained it one afternoon to Murbella, the two of them alone in a gray-walled interview chamber of the no-ship. Standing close together facing each other. Eyes at a level. Quite informal and intimate. Except for the knowledge of those comeyes all around them.\n“Watchdogs,” Odrade said, responding to a question from Murbella. “It means we are mutual gadflies. Don’t make that more than it is. We seldom nag. A simple word can be enough.”\nMurbella, her oval face drawn into a look of distaste, the wide-set green eyes intent, obviously thought Odrade\nreferred to some common signal, a word or saying the Sisters used in such situations.\n“What word?”\n“Any word, dammit! Whatever’s appropriate. It’s like a mutual reflex. We share a common ‘tic’ that comes not to annoy us. We welcome it because it keeps us on our toes.”\n“And you'll watchdog me if | become a Reverend Mother?”\n“We want our watchdogs. We’d be weaker without them.”\n“It sounds oppressive.”\n“We don’t find it so.”\n“I think it’s repellent.” She looked at the glittering lenses in the ceiling. “Like those damned comeyes.”\n“We take care of our own, Murbella. Once you’re a Bene Gesserit, you’re assured of lifelong maintenance.”\n“A comfortable niche.” Sneering.\nOdrade spoke softly. “Something quite different. You are challenged throughout your life. You repay the Sisterhood right up to the limits of your abilities.”\n“Watchdogs!”\n“We're always mindful of one another. Some of us in positions of power can be authoritarian at times, familiar even, but only to a point carefully measured for the requirements of the moment.”\n“Never really warm or tender,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8d4446bb3a4c246f63eafa81682d5e556cbfe4390bfdbf62a14d1c3e6eed651a_v2"}
