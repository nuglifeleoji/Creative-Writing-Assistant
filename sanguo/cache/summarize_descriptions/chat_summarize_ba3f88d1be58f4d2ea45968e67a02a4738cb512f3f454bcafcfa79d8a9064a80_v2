He is best known for his exceptional literary talent, which earned him recognition and admiration in the realm of poetry. His relationship with his elder brother, Cao Pi, was notably tumultuous, marked by rivalry and competition, particularly in the literary field.\n\nCao Zhi's poetic prowess is exemplified by his famous seven-step poem, which is celebrated for its emotional depth and artistic expression. This poem has become a significant part of his legacy, showcasing his ability to convey complex feelings and thoughts succinctly. Despite his literary achievements, Cao Zhi's life was characterized by an extravagant lifestyle and a penchant for indulgence in alcohol. These personal choices ultimately influenced his father's decision not to appoint him as heir, as Cao Cao favored a more disciplined and responsible successor.\n\nThroughout his life, Cao Zhi was favored by his father, who recognized his talents but also saw the potential pitfalls of his lifestyle. This duality in Cao Zhi's character—his remarkable literary skills juxtaposed with his reckless behavior—paints a complex picture of a man who was both celebrated and criticized in his time. His legacy endures through his poetry, which continues to be studied and appreciated for its artistic merit and emotional resonance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "protected_material_text": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898682, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 568, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
