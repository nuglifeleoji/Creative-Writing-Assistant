不可能再和孙玉亭过不去了。至于当年玉亭和他弟媳王彩娥的“麻糊事件”，也早已烟消云散；那个风骚女人几年前就改嫁，成了纯粹的外人，而玉亭现在却成了他的亲戚！ \n　　在金强的地盘子问题上，金俊武、孙玉亭和田福堂都心照不宣地站到了一块。金俊山和田海民怎么可能向这个强大的临时联盟挑战呢？ \n　　瞧，中国农村的政治已经“发达”到了何种程度！ \n　　这个多年来的支部会零零拉拉一直开到鸡叫一遍才结束，令人惊讶的是，其他人都熬得打起了哈欠，而福堂同志自始至终精神饱满！ \n　　是的，通过这个会，给了田福堂一点小小的精神刺激，使他几年来的颓丧情绪神奇地得到了改观……会后不久的一天，田福堂竟然回心转意，真的决定动身去看望自己的女儿和儿子。是啊，说心里话，几年来，他急是急、气是气，但梦里都在想念自己的儿女。再说，现在又有了孙女外孙子，他急切地盼望能很快地见到这两个亲亲的亲骨肉！ \n　　老伴一听说丈夫要出门去看望儿女，高兴得一边抹眼泪，一边用发抖的手为他准备上路的行囊——主要是为两个小孙子打闹礼物。 \n　　田福堂准备先到黄原去看女儿，他担心弟弟调到省里去当官后，他女儿在黄原就失去了靠山。当然，还有她公公李登云哩。但他亲家是个卫生局长，不掌什么大权！ \n　　他打算在看完女儿返回的途中，再去看儿子。至于是不是要把润生一家人接回双水村，他还没拿定主意，只能等他到那个陌生的外县村庄见了他们再说……在金光亮蹶着屁股，一脸哭丧用镢头在庙坪刨他命根子一样的泡桐树的时候，田福堂就暂时告别了那个破碾盘，咳嗽气喘地在村中上了长途公共车，动身到外地看望他的儿子和女儿去了。 \n                  第43章\n　　润叶在四月上旬顺利地生下了一个儿子。 \n　　三十一岁生头胎孩子，往是令人担心的。临产前四五天，婆婆刘志英就坚持让她住进了自己任党委书记的黄原市医院。妇产科最好的大夫已经做好了剖腹产的准备。结果孩子却顺利地自然出生了。 \n　　孩子取名“乐乐”，官名李乐。 \n　　乐乐的出生确实乐坏了这家人。母子从医院回家后，向前高兴得哭一阵又笑一阵。李登云和刘志英更不用说，他们不仅雇了保姆，而且两口子都失去了上班的热情，在整个月子里轮流帮保姆侍候小孙子和儿媳妇。向前满怀激情，以轮\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
