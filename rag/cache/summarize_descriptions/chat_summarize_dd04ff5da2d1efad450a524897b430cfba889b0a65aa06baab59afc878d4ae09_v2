While he does not explicitly name Alhamia as the location, he has referenced the death of his sister in a Harkonnen prison, suggesting a personal history of suffering under Harkonnen rule. The circumstances of his imprisonment and his sister's fate remain connected to the brutality of the Harkonnens, with Alhamia Prison serving as a confirmed site of his captivity. His rescue by Duke Leto marked a turning point in his life, leading to his loyalty to House Atreides.
