\n　　在这些漫长的没有白天的日子里，由于有金秀在身边，他并没有感到过寂寞。他和秀用外人所难以体会的美妙的原西土话拉家常；有时候，秀还给他读小说，读诗；或者两个人一块听音乐…… \n　　在他重见天日的那天，妹妹兰香也赶来了。当然，和妹妹一起来的还有她的男朋友吴仲平。 \n　　绷带和纱布一层层揭开……当他时隔多日，再一次真实地看见立在他面前的亲人时，忍不住眼里含满了泪水。他有一种重新回到人间的感觉。 \n　　他泪花闪闪的目光依次在秀、兰香和仲平脸上停留了片刻；然后有点不好意思地扭过头，透过玻璃窗户，久久地望着室外灿烂的太阳。太阳，太阳，在任何地方都美好地照耀着我们！ \n　　因为脑震荡还没有痊愈，他要继续住院治疗。 \n　　这下子，陪伴他的是三个人了！秀因为还在医院实习，经常在他身边；兰香和仲平隔一天就来医院看望他一回，吃的东西堆得满房子都是。 \n　　这期间，少平接到惠英嫂的一封焦急万分的信，说她等轮休假一到，就带着明明来看他。他赶忙给她回了一封信，说自己一切都平安无事，不久就能出院，让她千万不要来，免得折腾不算，还要耽误明明的学习……几天以后，吴仲平和兰香与他单独谈了一件重大的事情。仲平提出，等少平出院后，由他给父亲做工作，把他从大牙湾煤矿调到省城来工作。 \n　　“我已经从侧面打听清楚了，我父亲和你们铜城矿务局局长是老相识。我让父亲给你们局长写封信，你带回去直接找他也行，或者我跟你去一趟也行。估计问题不大。”仲平热心地对他的“妻哥”说。 \n　　少平也知道“问题不大”。省委常务副书记通过局长调个煤矿工人，那的确易如反掌。 \n　　但他没有马上对这件事表态。他不愿用一些堂皇的高调拒绝仲平的好意，以此证明自己的“思想境界”不凡。但说实话，他至少在目前对来大城市生活产生不了热情。不是他对大城市有什么偏见。不，大城市的生活如此丰富多彩，对任何人都是有魅力的。 \n　　最主要的是，他对煤矿有了一种不能割舍的感情。感情啊，常常会令人难以置信地决定一个人的行为！正如男女结合，决定的因素往往不仅仅是因为对方漂亮，而正是那种说不清道不明的刻骨铭心的感情。是啊，大牙湾是他生活的恋人。他深深地爱着这个“黑皮肤的姑娘”；他不能在感情上和它断然割舍。他在那里流过汗，淌过血，他怎么会轻\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
