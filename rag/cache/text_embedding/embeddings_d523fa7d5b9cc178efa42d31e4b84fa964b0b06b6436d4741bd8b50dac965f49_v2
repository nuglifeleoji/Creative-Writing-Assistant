smarting. “Gurney....”\nIt seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each other on the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh.\n“You young pup! You young pup!” Gurney kept saying.\nAnd Paul: “Gurney, man! Gurney, man!”\nPresently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep breath. “So you’re why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics. | might’ve known. They keep doing things I could’ve planned myself. If I'd only known....” He shook his head. “If you’d only got word to me, lad. Nothing would've stopped me. I’d have come arunning and...”\nA look in Paul’s eyes stopped him...the hard, weighing stare.\nGurney sighed. “Sure, and there’d have been those who wondered why Gurney Halleck went arunning, and some would’ve done more than question. They’d have gone hunting for answers.”\nPaul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them—the looks of curious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin. He turned from the death commandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled him with elation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the future where all was well.\nWith Gurney at my side....\nPaul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, Studied the smuggler crew who had come with Halleck.\n“How do your men stand, Gurney?” he asked.\n“They’re smugglers all,” Gurney said. “They stand where the profit is.”\n“Little enough profit in our venture,” Paul said, and he noted the subtle finger signal flashed to him by Gurney’s right hand—the old hand code out of their past. There were men to fear and distrust in the Smuggler crew.\nPaul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men standing guard above them on the rocks. He saw Stilgar there. Memory of the unsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Paul’s elation.\n“Stilgar,” he said, “this is Gurney Halleck of whom you’ve heard me speak. My father’s master-of-arms,\none of the swordmasters who instructed me, an old friend. He can be trusted in any venture.”\n“I hear,” Stilgar said. “You are his Duke.”\nPaul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had impelled Stilgar to say just that. His Duke. There had been a strange subtle intonation in Stilgar’s voice, as though he would rather have said something else. And that wasn't like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke his mind.\nMy Duke! Gurney thought. He looked anew at Paul. Yes, with Leto dead, the title fell on Paul’s shoulders.\nThe pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in Gurney’s mind. My Duke! A place that had been dead within him began coming alive. Only part of his awareness focused on Paul’s ordering the smuggler crew disarmed until they could be questioned.\nGurney’s mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men protesting. He shook his head, whirled. “Are you men deaf?” he barked. “This is the rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands.”\nGrumbling, the smugglers submitted.\nPaul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. “I’d not have expected you to walk into this trap, Gurney.”\n“I’m properly chastened,” Gurney said. “I'll wager yon patch of spice is little more than a sand grain’s thickness, a bait to lure us.”\n“That’s a wager you'd win,” Paul said. He looked down at the men being disarmed. “Are there any more of my father’s men among your crew?”\n“None. We’re spread thin. There’re a few among the free traders. Most have spent their profits to leave this place.”\n“But you stayed.”\n“I stayed.”\n“Because Rabban is here,” Paul said.\n“I thought | had nothing left but revenge,” Gurney Said.\nAn oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see a Fremen waving his kerchief.\n“A maker comes,” Paul said. He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney following, looked off to the southwest. The burrow mound of a worm could be seen in the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut directly through the dunes on a course toward the ridge.\n“He’s big enough,” Paul said.\nA clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them. It turned on its treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.\n“Too bad we couldn't have saved the carryall,” Paul said.\nGurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by Fremen rockets. He felt a sudden pang for the men lost there —his men, and he said: “Your father would’ve been more concerned for the men he couldn't save.”\nPaul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze. Presently, he said: “They were your friends, Gurney. | understand. To us, though, they were trespassers who\nmight see things they shouldn’t see. You must understand that.”\n“I understand it well enough,” Gurney said. “Now, I’m curious to see what I shouldn't.”\nPaul looked up to see the old and well- remembered wolfish grin on Halleck’s face, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the man’s jaw.\nGurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were going about their business all over the landscape. It struck him that none of them appeared worried by the approach of the worm.\nA thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice—a deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet. Gurney saw Fremen spread out across the sand there in the path of the worm.\nThe worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its rings rippling and twisting. In a moment, from his vantage point above the desert, Gurney saw the taking of a worm—the daring leap of the first hookman, the turning of the creature, the way an entire band of men went up the scaly, glistening curve of the worm’s side.\n“There’s one of the things you shouldn’t have seen,” Paul said.\n“There’s been stories and rumors,” Gurney said. “But it’s not a thing easy to believe without seeing it.” He shook his head. “The creature all men on Arrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal.”\n“You heard my father speak of desert power,” Paul said. “There it is. The surface of this planet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition can stop us.”\nUs, Gurney thought. He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one of them. Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Paul’s eyes. His own eyes, he knew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods and there was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them. They spoke of “the touch of the spicebrush” to mean a man had gone too native. And there was always a hint of distrust in the idea.\n“There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in these latitudes,” Paul said. “But Rabban has little enough air cover left that he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand.” He looked at Gurney. “Your aircraft were a shock to us here.”\nTo us...tO US....\nGurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. “We weren’t the shock to you that you were to us,” he said.\n“What’s the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?” Paul asked.\n“They say they’ve fortified the graben villages to the point where you cannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their defenses while you wear yourselves out in futile attack.”\n“In a word,” Paul said, “they’re immobilized.”\n“While you can go where you will,” Gurney said.\n“It’s a tactic | learned from you,” Paul said. “They've lost the initiative, which means they’ve lost the war.”\nGurney smiled, a slow, Knowing expression.\n“Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be,” Paul said. He glanced at Gurney. “Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign?”\n“Enlist?” Gurney stared at him. “My Lord, I’ve never left your service. You’re the only one left me... to think you dead. And |, being cast adrift, made what shrift | could, waiting for the moment | might sell my life for what it’s worth—the death of Rabban.”\nAn embarrassed silence settled over Paul.\nA woman came climbing up the rocks toward them, her eyes between stillsuit hood and face mask flicking between Paul and his companion. She Stopped in front of Paul. Gurney noted the possessive air about her, the way she stood close to Paul.\n“Chani,” Paul said, “this is Gurney Halleck. You’ve heard me speak of him.”\nShe looked at Halleck, back to Paul. “I have heard.”\n“Where did the men go on the maker?” Paul asked.\n“They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment.”\n“Well then....” Paul broke off, sniffed the air.\n“There’s wind coming,” Chani said.\nA voice called out from the ridgetop above them: “Ho, there—the wind!”\nGurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now—a rushing about and sense of hurry. A thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear of the wind. The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a way was opened for it among the rocks...and the rocks closed\nbehind it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes.\n“Have you many such hiding places?” Gurney asked.\n“Many times many,” Paul said. He looked at Chani. “Find Korba. Tell him that Gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew who’re not to be trusted.”\nShe looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks, leaping with a gazelle- like agility.\n“She is your woman,” Gurney said.\n“The mother of my firstborn,” Paul said. “There’s another Leto among the Atreides.”\nGurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.\nPaul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads.\n“Seal your suit,” Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his face.\nGurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.\nPaul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: “Which of your crew don’t you trust, Gurney?”\n“There’re some new recruits,” Gurney said. “Offworlders....” He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so easily to his tongue.\n“Yes?” Paul said.\n“They're not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we", "- like agility.\n“She is your woman,” Gurney said.\n“The mother of my firstborn,” Paul said. “There’s another Leto among the Atreides.”\nGurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.\nPaul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads.\n“Seal your suit,” Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his face.\nGurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.\nPaul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: “Which of your crew don’t you trust, Gurney?”\n“There’re some new recruits,” Gurney said. “Offworlders....” He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so easily to his tongue.\n“Yes?” Paul said.\n“They're not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get,” Gurney said. “They’re tougher.”\n“Harkonnen spies?” Paul asked.\n“I think, m’Lord, that they report to no Harkonnen. | suspect they’re men of the Imperial service. They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about them.”\nPaul shot a sharp glance at him. “Sardaukar?”\nGurney shrugged. “They could be, but it’s well masked.”\nPaul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern of Atreides retainer...but with subtle reservations...differences. Arrakis had changed him, too.\nTwo hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing upward. One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder.\n“Where are my crew now?” Gurney asked.\n“Secure in the rocks below us,” Paul said. “We’ve a cave here—Cave of Birds. We'll decide what to do with them after the storm.”\nA voice called from above them: “Muad’Dib!”\nPaul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave. Paul signaled he had heard.\nGurney studied him with a new expression. “You're Muad’Dib?” he asked. “You're the will-o’-the-sand?”\n“It's my Fremen name,” Paul said.\nGurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding. Half his own crew dead on the sand, the others captive. He did not care about the new recruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men, friends, people for whom he felt responsible. “We’ll decide what to do with them after the storm.” That’s what Paul had said, Muad’Dib had\nsaid. And Gurney recalled the stories told of Muad’Dib, the Lisan al-Gaib—how he had taken the Skin of a Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded by death commandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their lips.\nHim.\nThe two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of Paul. The dark-faced one said: “All secure, Muad’Dib. We best get below now.”\n“Right.”\nGurney noted the tone of the man’s voice—half command and half request. This was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new Fremen legends.\nPaul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: “Korba, what’s in the bundle?”\nStilgar answered: “’Twas in the crawler. It had the initial of your friend here and it contains a baliset. Many times have | heard you speak of the prowess of Gurney Halleck on the baliset.”\nGurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.\n“You’ve a companion who thinks, m’Lord,” Gurney said. “Thank you, Stilgar.”\nStilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said: “Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here.”\nGurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this conversation. There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney wondered if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen. Here\nwas someone called Gurney Halleck who’d known Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who Shared a cameraderie that Stilgar could never invade.\n“You are two I'd have be friends,” Paul said.\n“Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown,” Gurney said. “Any killer of Harkonnens I'd feel honored to count among my friends.”\n“Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?” Paul asked.\nSlowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy calluses of Gurney’s swordhand. “There’re few who haven’t heard the name of Gurney Halleck,” he said, and released his grip. He turned to Paul. “The storm comes rushing.”\n“At once,” Paul said.\nStilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and turning path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave. Men hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them. Glowglobes showed a broad, dome-ceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from it.\nPaul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into the passage. The others headed for another passage opposite the entrance. Paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-colored hangings on its walls.\n“We can have some privacy here for a while,” Paul said. “The others will respect my—”\nAn alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting and clashing of weapons. Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and out\nonto the atrium lip above the outer chamber. Gurney was right behind, weapon drawn.\nBeneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures. Paul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the Fremen robes and bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed. Senses that his mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant face—the Fremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes, but the smugglers were crouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed.\nThat habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.\nA Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battle cry was lifted to echo in the chamber: “Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!”\nAnother eye had also picked Paul out. A black knife came hurtling toward him. Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him, glanced to see Gurney retrieve it.\nThe triangular knots were being pressed back now.\nGurney held the knife up in front of Paul’s eyes, pointed to the hairline yellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest, multifaceted eyes at the pommel.\nSardaukar for certain.\nPaul stepped out to the lip of the ledge. Only three of the Sardaukar remained. Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted pattern across the chamber.\n“Hold!” Paul shouted. “The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!”\nThe fighting wavered, hesitated.\n“You Sardaukar!” Paul called to the remaining group. “By whose orders do you threaten a ruling Duke?” And, quickly, as his men started to press in around the Sardaukar: “Hold, | say!”\nOne of the cornered trio straightened. “Who says we're Sardaukar?” he demanded.\nPaul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. “This Says you’re Sardaukar.”\n“Then who says you’re a ruling Duke?” the man demanded.\nPaul gestured to the Fedaykin. “These men say I’m a ruling Duke. Your own emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. /am House Atreides.”\nThe Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.\nPaul studied the man—tall, flat-featured, with a pale scar across half his left cheek. Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there was that pride about him without which a Sardaukar appeared undressed—and with which he could appear fully clothed though naked.\nPaul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: “Korba, how came they to have weapons?”\n“They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their stillsuits,” the lieutenant said.\nPaul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his attention back to the lieutenant. There was no need for words. The lieutenant lowered his eyes.\n“Where is Chani?” Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.\n“Stilgar spirited her aside.” He nodded toward the other passage, glanced at the dead and wounded. “I hold myself responsible for this mistake, Muad’Dib.”\n“How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?” Paul asked.\n“Ten.”\nPaul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.\nA tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus exposed to danger. This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the Fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of Muad’Dib.\nWithout turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: “How many are our casualties?”\n“Four wounded, two dead, Muad’Dib.”\nPaul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar; Chani and Stilgar were standing in the other passage. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring into the offworld whites of the spokesman’s eyes. “You, what is your name?” Paul demanded.\nThe man stiffened, glanced left and right.\n“Don’t try it,” Paul said. “It’s obvious to me that you were ordered to seek out and destroy Muad’Dib. l'Il warrant you were the ones suggested seeking Spice in the deep desert.”\nA gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin Smile to Paul’s lips. Blood suffused the Sardaukar’s face.\n“What you see before you is more than Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “Seven of you are dead for two of us. Three for one. Pretty good against Sardaukar, eh?”\nThe man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.\n“I asked your name,” Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice: “Tell me your name!”\n“Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!” the man snapped. His jaw dropped. He stared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.\n“Well, Captain Aramsham,” Paul said, “the Harkonnens would pay dearly to learn what you now know. And the Emperor—what he wouldn’t give to learn an Atreides still lives despite his treachery.”\nThe captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him. Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the man’s head. Sardaukar did not Submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.\nStill using the Voice, Paul said: “Submit, Captain.”\nThe man at the captain’s left leaped without warning", " as the Fedaykin pressed forward.\n“I asked your name,” Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice: “Tell me your name!”\n“Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!” the man snapped.

Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the man’s head. Sardaukar did not Submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.\nStill using the Voice, Paul said: “Submit, Captain.”\nThe man at the captain’s left leaped without warning toward Paul, met the flashing impact of his own captain’s knife in his chest. The attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.\nThe captain faced his sole remaining companion. “| decide what best serves His Majesty,” he said. “Understood?”\nThe other Sardaukar’s shoulders slumped.\n“Drop your weapon,” the captain said.\nThe Sardaukar obeyed.\nThe captain returned his attention to Paul. “I have killed a friend for you,” he said. “Let us always remember that.”\n“You're my prisoners,” Paul said. “You submitted to me. Whether you live or die is of no importance.” He\nmotioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar, signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.\nThe guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.\nPaul bent toward his lieutenant.\n“Muad’Dib,” the man said. “I failed you in....”\n“The failure was mine, Korba,” Paul said. “l Should’ve warned you what to seek. In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this. Remember, too, that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items secreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter. They'll have more than one false tooth. They carry coils of shigawire in their hair—so fine you can barely detect it, yet strong enough to garrote a man and cut off his head in the process. With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope them—both reflex and hard ray— cut off every scrap of body hair. And when you’re through, be certain you haven’t discovered everything.”\nHe looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.\n“Then we best kill them,” the lieutenant said.\nPaul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. “No. | want them to escape.”\nGurney stared at him. “Sire....” he breathed.\n“Yes?”\n“Your man here is right. Kill those prisoners at once. Destroy all evidence of them. You’ve shamed Imperial Sardaukar! When the Emperor learns that he'll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.”\n“The Emperor’s not likely to have that power over me,” Paul said. He spoke slowly, coldly. Something had happened inside him while he faced the Sardaukar. A sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness. “Gurney,” he said, “are there many Guildsmen around Rabban?”\nGurney straightened, eyes narrowed. “Your question makes no....”\n“Are there?” Paul barked.\n“Arrakis is crawling with Guild agents. They’re buying spice as though it were the most precious thing in the universe. Why else do you think we ventured this far tnto....”\n“It is the most precious thing in the universe,” Paul said. “To them.”\nHe looked toward Stilgar and Chani who were now crossing the chamber toward him. “And we control it, Gurney.”\n“The Harkonnens control it!” Gurney protested.\n“The people who can destroy a thing, they control it,” Paul said. He waved a hand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar who stopped in front of Paul, Chani beside him.\nPaul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar. “You live for the good of the tribe,” Paul said. “Could you draw my life’s blood with that knife?”\n“For the good of the tribe,” Stilgar growled.\n“Then use that knife,” Paul said.\n“Are you Calling me out?” Stilgar demanded.\n“If | do,” Paul said, “I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay me.”\nStilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.\nChani said, “Usul!” then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.\nWhile Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: “You are Stilgar, a fighting man. When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in the front of battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani.”\n“She's my niece,” Stilgar said. “If there’d been any doubt of your Fedaykin handling those scum....”\n“Why was your first thought of Chani?” Paul demanded.\n“It wasn't!”\n“Oh?”\n“It was of you,” Stilgar admitted.\n“Do you think you could lift your hand against me?” Paul asked.\nStilgar began to tremble. “It’s the way,” he muttered.\n“It’s the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their water as a gift from Shai- hulud,” Paul said. “Yet you permitted two such to live one night, my mother and myself.”\nAs Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: “Ways change, Stil. You have changed them yourself.”\nStilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held.\n“When I am Duke in Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think l'Il have time to concern myself with every detail of governing Tabr sietch?” Paul\nasked. “Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family?”\nStilgar continued staring at the knife.\n“Do you think | wish to cut off my right arm?” Paul demanded.\nSlowly, Stilgar looked up at him.\n“You!” Paul said. “Do you think | wish to deprive myself or the tribe of your wisdom and strength?”\nIn a low voice, Stilgar said: “The young man of my tribe whose name is known to me, this young man | could kill on the challenge floor, Shai-hulud willing. The Lisan al-Gaib, him | could not harm. You knew this when you handed me this knife.”\n“I knew it,” Paul agreed.\nStilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the floor. “Ways change,” he Said.\n“Chant,” Paul said, “go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be available into—”\n“But you said we would go to the south!” she protested.\n“I was wrong,” he said. “The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not there.”\nShe took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all necessities in the midst of a life involved with death.\n“You will give my mother a message for her ears alone,” Paul said. “Tell her that Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be found to make the young men accept this without combat.”\nChani glanced at Stilgar.\n“Do as he says,” Stilgar growled. “We both know he could overcome me...and I could not raise my hand against him...for the good of the tribe.”\n“I shall return with your mother,” Chani said.\n“Send her,” Paul said. “Stilgar’s instinct was right. | am stronger when you are safe. You will remain in the sietch.”\nShe started to protest, swallowed it.\n“Sihaya,” Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to the right, met Gurney’s glaring eyes.\nThe interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a cloud around Gurney since Paul’s reference to his mother.\n“Your mother,” Gurney said.\n“Idaho saved us the night of the raid,” Paul said, distracted by the parting with Chani. “Right now we've—”\n“What of Duncan Idaho, m’Lord?” Gurney asked.\n“He’s dead—buying us a bit of time to escape.”\nThe she-witch alive! Gurney thought. The one | swore vengeance against, alive! And it’s obvious Duke Paul doesn’t know what manner of creature gave him birth. The evil one: Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!\nPaul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge. He glanced back, noted that the wounded and dead had been removed, and he thought bitterly that here was another chapter in the legend of Paul-Muad’Dib. / didn’t even draw my knife, but it'll be said of this day that | slew twenty Sardaukar by my own hand.\nGurney followed with Stilgar, stepping on ground that he did not even feel. The cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by rage. The she-witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves. | must contrive it that Paul learns the truth about her before I slay her.\nHow often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe crowd in the cavern assembly chamber\nradiated that pack feeling Jessica had sensed the day Paul killed Jamis. There was murmuring nervousness in the voices. Little cliques gathered like knots among the robes.\nJessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the ledge from Paul’s private quarters. She felt rested after the long journey up from the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the captured ornithopters.\n“We do not have full control of the air,” he had said. “And we must not become dependent upon offworld fuel. Both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and saved for the day of maximum effort.”\nPaul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge. The pale light of glowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality. It was like a tableau, but with the added dimension of warren smells, the whispers, the sounds of shuffling feet.\nShe studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise—Gurney Halleck. The thought of Gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier past—days of love and beauty with Paul’s father.\nStilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge. There was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without talking.\nWe must not lose that man, Jessica thought. Paul’s plan must work. Anything else would be the highest tragedy.\nShe strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down into the crowd. A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul. And silence followed her.\nShe knew the meaning of the silence—the unspoken questions of the people, awe of the Reverend Mother.\nThe young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him. “AN men beneath your position covet your station,” went the Bene Gesserit axiom.
