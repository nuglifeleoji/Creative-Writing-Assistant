 叶锋一家就是在这种不太好的气氛下被送出门的。才一出门，叶锋的妻子唐晓萌就忍不住道：“你也太莽撞了。”\n\n    叶锋苦笑道：“我也没想到会发生这种事儿。”\n\n    唐晓萌的表情随之变得柔和，握住他的手，低声道：“轩宇爸爸有没有难为你？”\n\n    叶锋摇摇头，“态度虽然不好，但也没说什么。不过，轩宇这孩子真的很不一般。很可能是个大才。”\n\n    “爸爸，什么是大才？”叶灵瞳看向叶锋。\n\n    叶锋搂住女儿的肩膀，轻轻的摇了摇头，“以后再说吧。我们回家。”\n\n    送走了叶锋一家，蓝潇的脸色就恢复了正常，他其实很清楚，叶锋已经做得很好了，而且他先前也打听过这位的来历，很神秘，毫无疑问是军方某秘密部队的。也正是因为如此，他先前才表现的非常不满，因为他最担心的是叶锋对于蓝轩宇的关注。\n\n    事实上，先前叶锋说的那番话和他分析的一模一样，蓝轩宇的蓝银草武魂，很可能是有龙类变异的。足以媲美光明圣龙的顶级武魂吗？蓝潇真的信的，毕竟，他的儿子可是蛋生的啊！\n\n    南澄已经不哭了，蓝轩宇此时也已经下了床，直奔厨房。\n\n    “妈妈我好饿，我要吃东西。”\n\n    “嗯嗯，妈妈给你做。”\n\n    吃饭这自然是一件很正常的事情，可当蓝轩宇真的开始吃以后，蓝潇和南澄很快就发现不正常了。\n\n    “妈妈做的饭最好吃了。”\n\n    “好好吃哦。”\n\n    儿子刚受了委屈，当妈妈的自然是有什么好吃的就给儿子做什么，可是，当这做的份数变成第三份的时候，南澄就开始吃惊了。而蓝轩宇吃完之后，却依旧用渴求的眼神看着她，表示自己并没有吃饱。\n\n    “儿子，你这也太能吃了啊！可别撑坏了。”南澄一边说着，一边摸了摸儿子的肚子。\n\n    腹部平坦，蓝轩宇就像是什么都没吃似的。\n\n    “妈妈，可是我还是好饿啊！不知道为什么，越吃越饿了。”蓝轩宇大眼睛眨啊眨，长长的睫毛扑闪、扑闪的。\n\n    “给他做吧。让他吃。”一直也在旁边看着儿子的蓝潇说道。\n\n    “不会撑坏了吧？”南澄疑惑的看向丈夫。\n\n
