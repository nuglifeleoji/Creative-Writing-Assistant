As a high-ranking figure within the Tleilaxu hierarchy, he directs the Face Dancers in various missions, including interventions in critical confrontations when necessary. The Face Dancers, shape-shifting agents under his authority, serve as key instruments in the Tleilaxu's schemes, executing tasks that align with their master's strategic goals.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize WAFF's leadership role, they also highlight the Face Dancers' involvement in direct actions, such as attempting to intervene in conflicts. This suggests that WAFF deploys them not only for subterfuge but also for active engagement when required. The collective information portrays WAFF as a central figure in orchestrating the Face Dancers' operations, reinforcing his position as a Tleilaxu Master with significant influence over these versatile operatives.  \n\nIn summary, WAFF's command over the Face Dancers is consistent across all descriptions, with no contradictionsâ€”only varying contexts of their deployment.
