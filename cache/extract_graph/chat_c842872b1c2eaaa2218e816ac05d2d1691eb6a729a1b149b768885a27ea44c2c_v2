He could see Fish Speakers on the left swinging their stunclubs. Sunlight flashed from knives. Then came the buzzing hum of lasguns, a sound Leto’s grandmother had once described as “the most terrible in our universe.” More hoarse shouts and screams erupted from the vanguard.\nLeto reacted with the first sound of lasguns. He swerved the Royal Cart off the road to his right, shifted from wheels to suspensors and drove the vehicle back like a battering ram into a clot of Face Dancers trying to enter the fray from his side. Turning in a tight arc, he hit more of them on the other side, feeling the crushing impact of flesh against plasteel, a red spray of blood, then he was down off the road into an erosion gully. The brown serrated sides of the gully flashed past him. He swept upward and swooped across the river canyon to a high, rock-girt viewpoint beside the Royal Road. There, he stopped and turned, well beyond the range of hand-held lasguns.\nWhat a surprise!\nLaughter shook his great body with grunting, trembling convulsions. Slowly, the amusement subsided.\nFrom his vantage, Leto could see the bridge and the area of the attack. Bodies lay in tangled disarray all across the\nscene and into the flanking gullies. He recognized courtier finery, Fish Speaker uniforms, the bloodied black of the Face Dancer disguises. Surviving courtiers huddled in the background while Fish Speakers sped among the fallen making sure the attackers were dead with a swift knife stroke into each body.\nLeto swept his gaze across the scene searching for the black uniform of his Duncan. There was not one such uniform standing. Not one! Leto put down a surge of frustration, then saw a clutch of Fish Speaker guards among the courtiers and... and a naked figure there.\nNaked!\nIt was Duncan! Naked! Of course! The Duncan Idaho without a uniform was not a Face Dancer.\nAgain, laughter shook him. Surprises on both sides. What a shock that must have been to the attackers. Obviously, they had not prepared themselves for such a response.\nLeto eased his cart out onto the roadway, dropped the wheels into position and rolled down to the bridge. He crossed the bridge with a sense of déjà vu, aware of the countless bridges in his memories, the crossings to view the aftermaths of battles. As he cleared the bridge, Idaho broke from the knot of guards and ran toward him, skipping and dodging the bodies. Leto stopped his cart and stared at the naked runner. The Duncan was like a Greek warrior- messenger dashing toward his commander to report the outcome of battle. The condensation of history stunned Leto’s memories.\nIdaho skidded to a stop beside the cart. Leto opened the bubble cover.\n“Face Dancers, every damned one!” Idaho panted.\nNot trying to conceal his amusement, Leto asked: “Whose idea was it to strip off your uniform?”\n“Mine! But they wouldn’t let me fight!”\nMoneo came running up then with a group of guards. One of the Fish Speakers tossed a guard’s blue cloak to Idaho,\ncalling out: “We’re trying to salvage a complete uniform from the bodies.”\n“| ripped mine off,” Idaho explained.\n“Did any of the Face Dancers escape?” Moneo asked.\n“Not a one,” Idaho said. “I admit your women are good fighters, but why wouldn’t they let me get into...”\n“Because they have instructions to protect you,” Leto said. “They always protect the most valuable...”\n“Four of them died getting me out of there!” Idaho said.\n“We lost more than thirty people altogether, Lord,” Moneo said. “We're still counting.”\n“How many Face Dancers?” Leto asked.\n“It looks like there were an even fifty of them, Lord,” Moneo said. He spoke softly, a stricken look on his face.\nLeto began to chuckle.\n“Why are you laughing?” Idaho demanded. “More than thirty of our people...”\n“But the Tleilaxu were so inept,” Leto said. “Do you not realize that only about five hundred years ago they would’ve been far more efficient, far more dangerous? Imagine them daring that foolish masquerade! And not anticipating your brilliant response!”\n“They had lasguns,” Idaho said.\nLeto twisted his bulky forward segments around and pointed at a hole burned in his canopy almost at the cart’s midpoint. A melted and fused starburst surrounded the hole.\n“They hit several other places underneath,” Leto said. “Fortunately, they did not damage any suspensors or wheels.”\nIdaho stared at the hole in the canopy, noted that it lined up with Leto’s body.\n“Didn’t it hit you?” he asked.\n“Oh, yes,” Leto said.\n“Are you injured?”\n“lam immune to lasguns,” Leto lied. “When we get time, | will demonstrate.”\n“Well, I’m not immune,” Idaho said. “And neither are your guards. Every one of us should have a shield belt.”\n“Shields are banned throughout the Empire,” Leto said. “It is a capital offense to have a shield.”\n“The question of shields,” Moneo ventured.\nIdaho thought Moneo was asking for an explanation of Shields and said: “The belts develop a force field which will repel any object trying to enter at a dangerous speed. They have one major drawback. If you intersect the force field with a lasgun beam, the resultant explosion rivals that of a very large fusion bomb. Attacker and attacked go together.”\nMoneo only stared at Idaho, who nodded.\n“I see why they were banned,” Idaho said. “I presume the Great Convention against atomics is still in force and working well?”\n“Working even better since we searched out all of the Family atomics and removed them to a safe place,” Leto said. “But we do not have time to discuss such matters here.”\n“We can discuss one thing,” Idaho said. “Walking out here in the open is too dangerous. We should...”\n“It is the tradition and we will continue it,” Leto said.\nMoneo leaned close to Idaho’s ear. “You are disturbing the Lord Leto,” he said.\n“But...”\n“Have you not considered how much easier it is to control a walking population?” Moneo asked.\nIdaho jerked around to stare into Moneo’s eyes with sudden comprehension.\nLeto took the opportunity to begin issuing orders. “Moneo, see that there is no sign of the attack left here, not one spot of blood or a torn rag of clothing—nothing.”\n“Yes, Lord.”\nIdaho turned at the sound of people pressing close around them, saw that all of the survivors, even the wounded wearing emergency bandages, had come up to listen.\n“All of you,” Leto said, addressing the throng around the cart. “Not a word of this. Let the Tleilaxu worry.” He looked at Idaho.\n“Duncan, how did those Face Dancers get into a region where only my Museum Fremen should roam free?”\nIdaho glanced involuntarily at Moneo.\n“Lord, it is my fault,” Moneo said. “I was the one who arranged for the Fremen to present their petition here. | even reassured Duncan Idaho about them.”\n“ĮI recall your mentioning the petition,” Leto said.\n“I thought it might amuse you, Lord.”\n“Petitions do not amuse me, they annoy me. | am especially annoyed by petitions from people whose one purpose in my scheme of things is to preserve the ancient forms.”\n“Lord, it was just that you have spoken so many times about the boredom of these peregrinations into...”\n“But | am not here to ease the boredom of others!”\n“Lord?”\n“The Museum Fremen understand nothing about the old ways. They are only good at going through the motions. This naturally bores them and their petitions always seek to introduce changes. That’s what annoys me. | will not permit changes. Now, where did you learn of the supposed petition?”\n“From the Fremen themselves,” Moneo said. “Adele...” He broke off, scowling.\n“Were the members of the delegation known to you?”\n“Of course, Lord. Otherwise l’d.. .”\n“They're dead,” Idaho said.\nMoneo looked at him, uncomprehending.\n“The people you knew were killed and replaced by Face Dancer mimics,” Idaho said.\n“I have been remiss,” Leto said. “I should’ve taught all of you how to detect Face Dancers. It will be corrected now that they grow foolishly bold.”\n“Why are they so bold?” Idaho asked.\n“Perhaps to distract us from something else,” Moneo said.\nLeto smiled at Moneo. Under the stress of personal threat, the majordomo’s mind worked well. He had failed his Lord by mistaking Face Dancer mimics for known Fremen. Now, Moneo felt that his continued service might depend upon those abilities for which the God Emperor had originally chosen him.\n“And now we have time to prepare ourselves,” Leto said.\n“Distract us from what?” Idaho demanded.\n“From another plot in which they participate,” Leto said. “They think I will punish them severely for this, but the Tleilaxu core remains safe because of you, Duncan.”\n“They didn’t intend to fail here,” Idaho said.\n“But it was a contingency for which they were prepared,” Moneo said.\n“They believe | will not destroy them because they hold the original cells of my Duncan Idaho,” Leto said. “Do you understand, Duncan?”\n“Are they right?” Idaho demanded.\n“They approach being wrong,” Leto said. He returned his attention to Moneo. “No sign of this event must go with us to Onn. Fresh uniforms, new guards to replace the dead and wounded ... everything just as it was.”\n“There are dead among your courtiers, Lord,” Moneo said.\n“Replace them!”\nMoneo bowed. “Yes, Lord.”\n“And send for a new canopy to my cart!”\n“As my Lord commands.”\nLeto backed his cart a few paces away, turned it and headed for the bridge, calling back to Idaho. “Duncan, you will accompany me.”\nSlowly at first, reluctance heavy in every movement, Idaho left Moneo and the others, then, increasing his pace, came up beside the cart’s open bubble and walked there while staring in at Leto.\n“What troubles you, Duncan?” Leto asked.\n“Do you really think of me as your Duncan?”\n“Of course, just as you think of me as your Leto.”\n“Why didn’t you know this attack was coming?”\n“Through my vaunted prescience?”\n“Yes!”\n“The Face Dancers have not attracted my attention for a long time,” Leto said.\n“| presume that is changed now?”\n“Not to any great degree.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because Moneo was correct. | will not let myself be distracted.”\n“Could they really have killed you there?”\n“A distinct possibility. You Know, Duncan, few understand what a disaster my end will be.”\n“What’re the Tleilaxu plotting?”\n“A snare, | think. A lovely snare. They have sent me a signal, Duncan.”\n“What signal?”\n“There is a new escalation in the desperate motives which drive some of my subjects.”\nThey left the bridge and began the climb to Leto’s viewpoint. Idaho walked in a fermenting silence.\nAt the top, Leto lifted his gaze over the far cliffs and looked at the barrens of the Sareer.\nThe lamentations of those in his ent\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c842872b1c2eaaa2218e816ac05d2d1691eb6a729a1b149b768885a27ea44c2c_v2"}
