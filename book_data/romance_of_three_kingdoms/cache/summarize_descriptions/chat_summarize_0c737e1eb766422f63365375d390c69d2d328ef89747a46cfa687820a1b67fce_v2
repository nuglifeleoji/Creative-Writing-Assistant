He played a significant role in the tumultuous conflicts of this period, particularly in his capacity as the governor of Xiliang. In this role, Ma Teng led an army against corrupt officials in Chang'an, demonstrating his commitment to addressing the rampant corruption that plagued the imperial capital.\n\nDespite his military prowess and leadership, Ma Teng's career ended tragically when he was executed by the powerful warlord Cao Cao. This execution was carried out under allegations of treason, a charge that also led to the death of his son.
