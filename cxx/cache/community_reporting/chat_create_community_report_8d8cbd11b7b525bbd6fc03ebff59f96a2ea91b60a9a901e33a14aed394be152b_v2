This era is marked by a duality of experiences: on one hand, it is remembered fondly by children for its joyous aspects, including games and banquets, which symbolize a time of freedom and happiness. On the other hand, it is also associated with turmoil, violence, and chaos, particularly due to a food crisis that led to instability and unrest within the city.\n\nThe Sugar City Era is noted for its rapid societal changes that followed the first national congress, which played a crucial role in shaping the current state of the republic. This period is not merely a nostalgic recollection; it represents a transformative phase in history that significantly impacted the nation's stability and development. The children’s reflections on this era highlight their experiences and memories, encapsulating both the celebratory and the distressing elements of their upbringing.\n\nWhile the Sugar City Era is often viewed through the lens of joy and community, it is essential to acknowledge the underlying challenges that defined this time. The violence and chaos stemming from the food crisis created a backdrop of uncertainty that affected the lives of many, including the children who later reminisced about the era. Thus, the Sugar City Era serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of childhood experiences during a time of significant historical change.\n\nIn summary, the Sugar City Era is a multifaceted period in Chinese history that embodies both the innocence of childhood celebrations and the harsh realities of societal challenges. It remains a vital part of the collective memory of children, representing a unique blend of joy and adversity that shaped their lives and the future of the nation.\",11\n661,五年计划,\"The \"\"五年计划\"\" (Five-Year Plan) is a strategic initiative proposed by FG, aimed at outlining the country's developmental trajectory over a five-year period.
