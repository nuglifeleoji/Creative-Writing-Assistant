这位副院长面前说话才管用。牧重天却没想到，季洪彬竟然也点了点头，道：“按照副院长说的办，不能给这些小家伙‘偷奸耍滑’的机会。不压迫一下，对后面考核的小组就不公平了。”\n\n    “啊？那好吧。”牧重天没想到季洪彬也赞成了银天凡的要求。这可是明显对蓝轩宇小组的不公平啊，可他也只能执行命令。\n\n    斗罗世界，擂台。\n\n    “蓝轩宇小组，向你们宣布，接下来这一场，你们将要面对的是昌千寻小组。这一场比赛你们必须要获胜。如果失败，将被算作后面几场比赛全部失败。”电子音响起，明显是牧重天的声音。\n\n    蓝轩宇和刘锋本来已经准备好冲刺了，听到这突如其来的电子音，两人不禁有些发愣。\n\n    “这是什么情况？怎么输了这场后面就全算输了?那岂不是说，如果输了，我们要受到惩罚?”刘锋吃惊地说道。\n\n    蓝轩宇也有点蒙。他们毕竟年纪还小，一时之间，哪里想得通规则为什么会改变。\n\n    就在此时，对面有三道身影缓缓浮现出来，正是吕千寻、叶灵瞳和常剑逸三人。\n\n    受到那电子音的影响，蓝轩宇和刘锋甚至连突袭的机会都失去了。\n\n    两个黄色魂环从吕千寻脚下升起，充分显现出了他两环大魂师的修为。\n\n    “咋办?”钱磊这会儿已经睁开了眼睛，因为他也听到了那电子音。\n\n    蓝轩宇看向他，递过去一个询问的眼神，钱磊苦笑着摇了摇头。这才休息了一会儿，他的精神力距离能够召唤一次还有差距。\n\n    也就是说，这一场依旧是二对三，即蓝轩宇和刘锋将面对两环的吕千寻，实力强悍的叶灵瞳和拥有迟缓控制能力的常剑逸。\n\n    迟缓对于刘锋的克制作用可想而知，在对方早有准备的情况下，就算蓝轩宇对他的增幅能帮他破解迟缓技能，可人家组的叶灵瞳和吕千寻也不弱二对三，这是一场比上一场更难的战斗，获胜的概率实在是太低了。\n\n    可是，这一场不能输！如果输了，后面的比赛就都要算输，下一轮都没有了，下个学期又怎么办?拼，只能拼了。\n\n    “怎么办?”刘锋也问出了同样的问题。无疑，他也有些慌了。\n\n    吕千寻身体膨胀，属于两环的气势迸发出来。三个人同时大步朝蓝轩宇和刘锋这边走来。\n\n    吕千寻其实是骄做的，他并不愿意在钱磊看起来失去了战斗力的情况下和蓝轩宇他们碰撞。\n\n    因为他已经是大魂师了，他希望在双方都处于最佳状态的情况下击败对手。\n\n    蓝轩宇有些无奈地耸耸肩，这都是老师逼的，既然你们�\n######################\nOutput:",
