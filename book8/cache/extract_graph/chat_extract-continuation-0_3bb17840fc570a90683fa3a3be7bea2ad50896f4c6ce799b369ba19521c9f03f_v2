寝室的三名同学作为擂主。其他各组，抽签进行攻擂。全部考核将分为九场。也就是说，三三三寝室的三位同学将进行九场战斗。每一场战斗之后，模拟舱将恢复他们的实力，一切重新开始。我们将根据比赛中同学们的表现，最终为你们打分。当然，能够击败三三三小组的，得分将会有所增加。”\n\n    这具体考核规则一出，原本一脸轻松自如的蓝轩宇三人不禁目瞪口呆。钱磊甚至差点哭出来。\n\n    这什么情况啊？怎么就一下变成众矢之的了？\n\n    刚刚中午吃饭的时候，他还得意洋洋呢，因为无论怎样他们都不会被淘汰啊！\n\n    可这下午的考核，也太不公平了吧。他们要打九场？\n\n    之前他们都试过了，虽然说模拟舱能够恢复魂力，可精神力却没法完全恢复的啊！根本就坚持不了九场那么久。而且，和每一组都来一场，意味着什么？意味着他们所有的能力都将曝光在大家面前，再无秘密可言。\n\n    这三个月来，他们三个那么低调，不就是为了更好的隐藏自己，等关键时刻，譬如下学期的考核中再有所表现吗？\n\n    “老师，我们放弃行不行？反正我们也已经上岸了。”钱磊忍不住说道。\n\n    牧重天脸色一沉，“这是你们展现自我的机会。我相信，其他小组都巴不得有这样一个机会来展现自身呢。虽说原本规定你们这学期已经不会被淘汰。但如果你们在接下来的九场考核中输掉过半比赛。那么，下个学期将取消你们所有的加号，同时，所有成绩减分百分之三十。”\n\n    “啊？”钱磊顿时有些傻眼了。怎么看这都像是学院有意针对他们啊！\n\n    事实上，下午的考核本来不是这样的。要怪，就怪蓝轩宇。他的精神力突破两百点，给了高能少年班老师们极大的刺激。以至于，老师们也都想看看，这三三三寝室究竟到了怎样的程度。\n\n    经过向学院报请之后，才有了这样奇葩的期末考试。\n\n    不过也没说错，譬如，吕千寻现在看着他们的目光都有些嫉妒了。换了是他，他巴不得做这个擂主。这可是荣誉啊！能够作为擂主，那就是公认被认为是最强的。也是向老师们展现自己的机会，成绩越好，后面获得学院的支持也就越越多。学院的资源，可是最为珍贵的，很多都是用钱买不到的。\n\n    刘锋碰了一下钱磊，眼中燃烧着强烈的战意。对他们来说，这无疑是一次考验。既然学院要考验，那就来吧。\n\n    蓝轩宇自己倒是挺平静的，他今天心情很好。精神力突破两百点，而且他可以肯定，是因为精神力测试，才让自己一下突破了的。到了灵通境中阶，他自己都觉得自己的精神层面似乎有了明显的提\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
