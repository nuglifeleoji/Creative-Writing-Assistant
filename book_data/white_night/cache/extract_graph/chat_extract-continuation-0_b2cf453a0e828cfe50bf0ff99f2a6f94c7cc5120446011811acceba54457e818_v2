右手伸出，按在刘锋肩头。顿时，刘锋也觉得全身一热，整个人的精气神瞬间暴增。\n\n    出了模拟器，所有的感知都会变得更加敏锐，此时此刻，他只觉得自己的武魂瞬间像是被点燃了一般，甚至带给他一种极其欢悦的情绪，白龙枪微微一震，枪身上的光芒明显转盛，枪锋处暴射出三寸枪芒。\n\n    最奇异的是，刘峰注意到，自己白龙枪的龙头处有了一个极为明显的变化，那原本闭合着的龙眸竟然睁开了，一种浑然合一，人枪一体的感觉瞬间传遍全身，让他有种脱胎换骨般的感觉。\n\n    “好棒，我好像整个人都变强了。有种要发泄的感觉。这真的是太美妙了啊……”刘锋看着蓝轩宇，双眸变得无比明亮。哪怕以他较为内向的性格，突然遇到了如此巨大的变化也不禁兴奋的叫了出来。\n\n    幸好，此时钱磊因为过度疲惫已经沉沉睡去，并没有被影响到。\n\n    蓝轩宇收回右手，他自己也默默的感受了一下先前的变化，令他奇怪的是，在他自己的感觉之中，并没有对刘锋做什么，只是一个简单的身体接触，最多就是还带着内心的善意。而并不是将自身魂力或者气血之力注入到刘锋体内。\n\n    所以说，这变化是刘锋那白龙枪自身的变化啊！而自己就像是一个媒介，只是碰触到他的身体，这变化自然而然就出现了。这着实是有些奇妙。\n\n    “再试试左手。”刘锋跃跃欲试的道。\n\n    “好！”蓝轩宇抬起左手，银纹蓝银草反卷，按在刘锋肩头。这次，刘锋的感觉就变得截然不同了，他只觉得全身一凉，一种清凉感瞬间传遍全身。紧接着，他右手的白龙枪仿佛整体散发出一层淡淡的冰雾，龙眸再次张开，而和上一次不同的是，上次龙眸中散发着的是淡淡的金色，而这一次，却变成了柔和的银色。\n\n    刘锋手腕一抖，白龙枪表面顿时冰雾释放，令周围的气温都降低了许多。熟睡中的钱磊下意识的拉了拉身边的被子，把自己裹得严实了。\n\n    “你赋予了我冰属性？”刘锋呆呆的看着蓝轩宇。\n\n    蓝轩宇大眼睛则是无辜的看着他，心说，我什么都没做啊！我就是碰触着你而已啊！\n\n    刘锋呆呆的看着蓝轩宇，蓝轩宇也看着他。两人沉默了一会儿，直到刘锋觉得屋子里是在有些冷了才反应过来。\n\n    “轩宇，你真的是太厉害了。”他由衷的说道。\n\n    蓝轩宇\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIU FENG<|>PERSON<|>Liu Feng experiences a significant enhancement
