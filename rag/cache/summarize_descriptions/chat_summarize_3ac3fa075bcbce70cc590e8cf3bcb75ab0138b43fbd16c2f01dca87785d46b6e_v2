These creatures, often described as resembling bats, serve as a vital tool for the Fremen, functioning both as messengers and for surveillance purposes. While one description inaccurately refers to them as \"messenger birds,\" the consistent theme across all descriptions confirms that *cielagos* are winged, bat-like animals used for distrans messagingâ€”a specialized form of communication. The term may also encompass the broader system of messaging involving these creatures. The Fremen rely on *cielagos* for efficient and discreet information transfer in their harsh desert environment, highlighting their adaptability and resourcefulness.  \n\nIn summary, *cielago* is a Fremen communication method centered on bat-like creatures, not birds, and includes both messaging and surveillance applications.
