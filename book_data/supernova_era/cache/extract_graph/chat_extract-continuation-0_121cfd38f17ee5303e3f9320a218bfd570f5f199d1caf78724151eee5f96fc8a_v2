“石神会想出这么异想天开的计划，八成是因为他平常总是走那个堤防吧。每天望着那些游民，也许他平时就这么想：他们到底是为何而活？难道只是这样默默等死吗？就算\n\n他们死了，恐怕也不会有任何人察觉，更不会有任何人难过吧――不过，这只是我的想像。”\n    “所以石神就认为，杀死那样的人也没关系吗？”草S向他确认。\n    “他应该没这么想。不过石神思考对策的背景有他们存在，这点应该不可否认。我记得之前跟你说过，只要符合逻辑，再冷酷的事他都做得出来。”\n    “杀人符合逻辑吗？”\n    “他想要的是‘他杀尸体’这片拼图。要完成整幅拼图，就不能少了那一片。”\n    草S终究还是无法理解。就连像在大学教课一样淡淡地述叙这件事的汤川，草S都觉得不正常。\n    “花冈靖子杀死富坚慎二的翌日早晨，石神和一名游民进行接触。虽然我不知道对话内容，但他肯定是找对方打工。打工的内容，就是先去富坚慎二租的出租旅馆，在那里待\n\n到晚上。石神想必在前一天夜里，就已经清除掉所有富坚慎二的痕迹了。留在房间里的，只有那个游民的指纹和毛发，到了晚上他就穿上石神给的衣服，前往指定场所。”\n    “条崎车站吗？”\n    草S这么一问，汤川摇摇头。\n    “不对，我想应该是前一站的瑞江车站。”\n    “瑞江车站？”\n    “石神想必先在条崎车站偷了脚踏车，再去瑞江车站和那个男人会合。当时石神很可能另备了一辆脚踏车，两人抵达旧江户川的堤防后，石神就杀了那个男人。他把对方的脸\n\n砸烂，当然是怕人发现那不是富坚慎二，不过他其实没必要烧毁指纹。因为出租旅馆应该留有遇害者的指纹，就算不烧指纹，警方想必也会误认死者就是富坚慎二。不过既已毁了\n\n脸，如果不连指纹也毁掉，那凶手的行动就会欠缺一贯性，所以他不得不烧毁指纹。可是这么一来，警方要查明身份就会大费周章。因此他才会在脚踏车上留下指纹，衣服没烧完\n\n也是基于同样的理由。”\n    “可是这样的话，脚踏车应该没必要是新的吧？”\n    “他会偷新的脚踏车，也是为了预防万一。”\n    “预防万一？”\n    “对石神来说最重要的，就是让警方正确查出犯案时间。就结果来说，解剖或许能做出较正确的推定，但他最怕的就是尸体如果发现得晚，会拉长犯案时间的推定范围。弄得\n\n不好，万一拉长到前一天晚上――也就是�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
