��大喜，唤军政司当面取了文书，置酒相待曰：“待军事毕后，自有酬劳。”孔明曰：“今日已不及，来日造起。至第三日，可差五百小军到江边搬箭。”饮了数杯，辞去。鲁肃曰：“此人莫非诈乎？”瑜曰：“他自送死，非我逼他。今明白对众要了文书，他便两胁生翅，也飞不去。我只分付军匠人等，教他故意迟延，凡应用物件，都不与齐备。如此，必然误了日期。那时定罪，有何理说？公今可去探他虚实，却来回报。\n\n    肃领命来见孔明。孔明曰：“吾曾告子敬，休对公瑾说，他必要害我。不想子敬不肯为我隐讳，今日果然又弄出事来。三日内如何造得十万箭？子敬只得救我！”肃曰：“公自取其祸，我如何救得你？”孔明曰：“望子敬借我二十只船，每船要军士三十人，船上皆用青布为幔，各束草千余个，分布两边。吾别有妙用。第三日包管有十万枝箭。只不可又教公瑾得知，若彼知之，吾计败矣。”肃允诺，却不解其意，回报周瑜，果然不提起借船之事，只言：“孔明并不用箭竹、翎毛、胶漆等物，自有道理。”瑜大疑曰：“且看他三日后如何回覆我！”却说鲁肃私自拨轻快船二十只，各船三十余人，并布幔束草等物，尽皆齐备，候孔明调用。第一日却不见孔明动静；第二日亦只不动。至第三日四更时分，孔明密请鲁肃到船中。肃问曰：“公召我来何意？”孔明曰：“特请子敬同往取箭。”肃曰：“何处去取？”孔明曰：“子敬休问，前去便见。”遂命将二十只船，用长索相连，径望北岸进发。是夜大雾漫天，长江之中，雾气更甚，对面不相见。孔明促舟前进，果然是好大雾！前人有篇《大雾垂江赋》曰：“大哉长江！西接岷、峨，南控三吴，北带九河。汇百川而入海，历万古以扬波。至若龙伯、海若，江妃、水母，长鲸千丈，天蜈九首，鬼怪异类，咸集而有。盖夫鬼神之所凭依，英雄之所战守也。时也阴阳既乱，昧爽不分。讶长空之一色，忽大雾之四屯。虽舆薪而莫睹，惟金鼓之可闻。初若溟濛，才隐南山之豹；渐而充塞，欲迷北海之鲲。然后上接高天，下垂厚地；渺乎苍茫，浩乎无际。鲸鲵出水而腾波，蛟龙潜渊而吐气。又如梅霖收溽，春阴酿寒；溟溟漠漠，洁浩漫漫。东失柴桑之岸，南无夏口之山。战船千艘，俱沉沦于岩壑；渔舟一叶，惊出没于波澜。甚则穹吴\n######################\nOutput:",
