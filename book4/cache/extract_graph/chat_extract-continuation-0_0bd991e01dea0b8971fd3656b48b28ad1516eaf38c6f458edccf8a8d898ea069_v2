\n　　他在车辕上挽一根套绳，扣在肩胛里，和牲畜一起拉着车，走过寂静而清冷的街道。平路上，他一般不太出力，让骡子拉着走，一旦上坡的时候，他就使出浑身的劲拼命拉车，尽量减轻牲口的负担。从十字街到中学有一道大陡坡，他常常挣着命拉车，两只手都快要趴到地上了；牲口和他都大汗淋漓，气喘得象两只风箱。这时候，他眼前就不由地浮现出黄河岸边那些手脚并用、匍伏在石壁小道上的纤夫……天天如此。 \n　　孙少安和他的铁青骡子把时间拉出了九月。 \n　　每一天下来，他临睡前都要在那孔破窑洞的左边土墙上用指甲划一道杠杠；然后在右边土墙上记下一天的收入、支出和净赚的钱数。随着左墙上杠杠的增多，右墙上的钱数也在增多；这一笔不断增加的钱，使孙少安每天睡觉前都要高兴得发半天呆…… \n                  第9章\n　　十月初，从原西城传回来了惊人消息：金光亮家即将高中毕业的小子金二锤，要去参加解放军了。 \n　　这消息使风起云涌的双水村更加激荡起来。在山里，在家里，在村中各处的闲话中心，金二锤当兵立刻成了全村人议论的话题。尤其在金家湾那边，所有金姓人家似乎都有些激动。 \n　　哈呀，多少年来，谁能想到，一个地主家庭成份的人，怎么可能去参加无产阶级的军队呢？别说地主成份，中农成份也难！特别是对于田福堂和孙玉亭这样的人来说，尽管年初就知道中央的政策“变”了，“五类分子”大部分摘了“帽”，今后他们的子弟一律和贫下中农子弟同等对待，不论入党入团，招工招干和参军，都不再受影响；可一旦这政策在他们村成为具体的事实，仍然使这些人震惊得目瞪口呆。 \n　　金光亮弟兄几家起先对这消息半信半疑。当二锤捎话回来证实了他要去参军，并说一两天就要回村向家人告别的时候，这一大家人才兴奋地忙乱起来。他们翻箱倒柜，碾米磨面，准备给出远门的娃娃备办几顿家乡的好吃喝。这些天里，常避免出头露面的金光亮这弟兄几家人，似乎专意到村中的各个公众场所去走动，说话的声音也提高了。长期无声无息的一家人，现在一下子就变得如此引人注目，这是否意味着，在双水村的生活舞台上，一些处于台下的角色渐渐要走上台来了？ \n　　最为得意的当然要数金光亮！这几天，他已经不出山劳动，专门在家里操持以等待儿子回来。实际上这些家务事都由老婆忙碌，他帮不了多少�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a
