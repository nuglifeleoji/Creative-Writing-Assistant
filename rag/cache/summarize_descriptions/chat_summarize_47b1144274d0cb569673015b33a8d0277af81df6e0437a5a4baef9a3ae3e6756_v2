Renowned for their mastery of genetic engineering, they specialize in creating **gholas** (cloned individuals with restored memories) and **Face Dancers** (shape-shifting agents). Their work extends to **axlotl tanks**, which produce gholas and even **Tleilaxu tank-grown melange**, demonstrating their biological dominance.  \n\nLed by figures such as **Waff** and later **Scytale**, the Bene Tleilax pursue their **Great Belief**, viewing genetic manipulation as the \"language of God.\" They are divided into **Masters** and **Face Dancers**, with the latter often deployed as spies or assassins. Their secrecy and amoral practices have made them both feared and distrusted, particularly by rival factions like the **Bene Gesserit**, with whom they engage in tense negotiations and conflicts.  \n\nHistorically, the Bene Tleilax opposed **Paul Atreides** and suffered diminished influence as a result. They also altered the **prana-bindu inheritance** of the **Duncan Idaho ghola** under Bene Gesserit orders, showcasing their role in broader political machinations. Their failed assassination attempt on **Leto II** during the Festival led to violent retaliation by the **Fish Speakers**, highlighting their precarious position within the empire.  \n\nBeyond warfare, they engage in **trade strategies**, scientific projects, and religious endeavors, with notable creations like **Bijaz**, a human distrans. Despite their ruthlessness, their patience and long-term planning suggest ambitions of eventual dominance.
