了，但粮库顶上的“市长”的孩子们却不停地向下射击着。掩体是个死角，他们打不到，只能向掩体前面孩子们开枪，而那些孩子大部分都是来找粮的无辜者。我实在无法在这里描述当时看到的，你想像一下一群包括三四岁小娃娃在内的男孩儿女孩儿在机枪和冲锋枪密集的弹雨中挣扎的景像吧！\n　　战斗很快结束，粮库顶被后来的孩子们攻占，“市长”的部下不是被打死就是投降了。那个穿西服的孩子站到“市长”刚才站的地方，令人惊奇的是，经过了这么一场激烈的枪战，他的西服和领带丝毫没起皱，头发也一点没乱，他对那些躲得远远的孩子们招着手：\n　　“小朋友们，过来，别怕，事情过去了，大家过来吧！”\n　　孩子们重新聚集过来，我也从大树后面走出来，但再也不敢到前面去了。\n　　穿西服的男孩子指着下面“市长”的尸体说：\n　　“大家看看，像这种东西能当市长吗？他连字都不识呢，这真是可笑，大家说，是不是可笑哇？”\n　　他的部下们都大笑起来，其中的一个跳上前来大声说：“我们的新市长可大不一样，他可有学问了，真的，大人们在的那阵儿，他的文章还在报上登过呢！我们都叫他‘博士’，跟他干准没错……”\n　　“闭嘴！”“博士”严厉地打断了那孩子的话，“您的话是极不合逻辑的，您不应该把我称为新市长，这是因为：一、这个家伙从来没有具备过市长的资格，从法律上讲他也从来就没有当过市长！既然前市长不存在，那还有什么新市长呢？当然，我这是指的大人们走了以后，大人们在的时侯还是有前市长的。二、从法律上讲，市长应该选举产生，怎么能够自封为市长呢？像这种败类，是我们城市的耻辱，您怎么竟把我降低到他的水准呢？好了，现在我们开始选举市长，同意我当市长的站到这面，不同意的站到这面。”\n　　下面的孩子很快分成了两拨，我站到不同意的那一拨去，我总觉得这帮小土匪不可信，但“博士”的下面话立刻使我改变了看法。\n　　“这些粮食，”“博士”指指后面的粮库说：“是属于我们这个城市的，是属于全体市民的！刚才这个家伙想独霸粮食，那是犯罪！现在，我要把粮食分给市民们！”\n　　然后就开始分粮食了，两拨孩子排起了两行长队，但只有同意“博士”当市长的那一队能分到粮食，我们这一队前面半天没人管。我们着急地催他们，“博士”走了过来，他说话的时侯笑容可掬：\n　　“安静，请安静，小朋友们，是这么回事。首先我要告诉大家，我们的城市是一个民主的城市，小朋友们有权力选择自己的市长。这一队小朋友选我当市长，我就是他们的市长；而你们这队呢？不选我当市长，那我自然就不是你们的市长啦！\n######################\nOutput:",
