Not so?”\n“That order is reserved for keeping our secrets from the hands of enemies.”\n“Is that why you want your own Face Dancers? Do you consider us enemies?”\nBefore he could compose a response, Bellonda’s projected figure appeared above the table, lifesize and partly translucent, dancing crystals of Archives behind her. “Urgent from Sheeana!” Bellonda said. “The spice blow has occurred. Sandworms!” The figure turned and looked at Scytale, comeyes perfectly coordinating her movements. “So you have lost a bargaining chip, Master Scytale! We have our spice at last!” The projected figure vanished with an audible click and a faint smell of ozone.\n“You're trying to trick me!” he blurted.\nBut the door at Odrade’s left opened. Sheeana entered towing a small Suspensor pod no more than two meters long. Its transparent sides repeated the glowglobes of the workroom in tiny bursts of yellow light. Something squirmed in the pod!\nSheeana stood aside without speaking, giving them a full view of the contents. So small! The worm was less than half the length of its container but perfect in every detail, stretched out there on a shallow bed of golden sand.\nScytale could not contain a gasp of awe. The Prophet!\nOdrade’s reaction was pragmatic. She bent close to the pod, peering into the miniature mouth. The scorching huff- huff of a great worm’s internal fires reduced to this? What a tiny mimicry!\nCrystal teeth flashed as it lifted its front segments.\nThe worm sent its mouth questing left and right. They all saw behind the teeth the miniature fire in its alien chemistry.\n“Thousands of them,” Sheeana said. “They came to a spice blow as they always do.”\nOdrade remained silent. We have done it! But this was Sheeana’s moment of triumph. Let her make the most of it. Scytale had never looked this defeated.\nSheeana opened the pod and lifted the worm from it, cradling it as though it were an infant. It lay quiescent in her arms.\nOdrade took a deep, satisfied breath. She still controls them.\n“Scytale,” Odrade said. He could not take his gaze from the worm.\n“Do you still serve the Prophet?” Odrade asked. “There he is!”\nHe did not know how to respond. Truly a revenant of the Prophet? He wanted to deny his first awed response but his eyes would not permit it.\nOdrade spoke softly. “While you were out on your foolish mission, your se/fish mission, we were serving the Prophet! We rescued his last revenant and brought him here. Chapterhouse will become another Dune!”\nShe sat back and steepled her hands in front of her. Bell was watching through the comeyes, of course. A Mentat’s observations would be valuable. Odrade wished Idaho were also watching. But he could look at a holo. It was clear to her that Scytale had seen the Bene Gesserit only as tools for restoration of his precious Tleilaxu civilization. Would this development force him to reveal inner secrets of his tanks? What would he offer?\n“I must have time to think.” A tremor in his voice.\n“About what would you think?”\nHe did not answer but kept his attention on Sheeana, who was replacing the tiny worm in its pod. She stroked it once before sealing the lid.\n“Tell me, Scytale,” Odrade insisted. “How can there be anything for you to reconsider? This is our Prophet! You say you serve the Great Belief. Then serve it!”\nShe could see his dreams dissolving. His own Face Dancers to print memories of those they killed, copying each victim’s shape and manner. He had never hoped to gull a Reverend Mother... but acolytes and simple workers of Chapterhouse ... all the secrets he had hoped to acquire, gone! Lost as certainly as the charred husks of Tleilaxu planets.\nOur Prophet, she said. He turned a stricken look toward Odrade but did not focus. What am I to do? These women no longer need me. But | need them!\n“Scytale.” How softly she spoke. “The Great Convention is ended. It’s a new universe out there.”\nHe tried to swallow in a dry throat. The whole concept of violence had taken on a new dimension. In the Old Empire, the Convention had guaranteed retaliation against anyone who dared burn a planet by attacking from space.\n“Escalated violence, Scytale.” Odrade’s voice was almost a whisper. “We Scatter pods of rage.”\nHe focused on her. What is she saying?\n“The hatred being stored up against Honored Matres,” She said. You are not the only one with losses, Scytale. Once, when problems arose in our civilization, the cry went out: “Bring a Reverend Mother!” Honored Matres prevent that. And the myths are recomposed. Golden light is cast upon our past. “It was better in the old days when the Bene Gesserit could help us. Where do you go for reliable Truthsayers these days? Arbitration? These Honored Matres have never heard the word! They were always courteous, the Reverend Mothers. You have to say that for them.”\nWhen Scytale did not respond, she said: “Think of what might happen if that rage were loosed in a Jihad!”\nWhen he still did not speak, she said: “You have seen it. Tleilaxu, Bene Gesserit, priests of the Divided God, and who knows how many more—all hunted like wild game.”\n“They cannot kill us all!” An agonized cry.\n“Can't they? Your Scattered ones made common cause with Honored Matres. Is that a sanctuary you would seek in the Scattering?”\nAnd there goes another dream: Little pods of Tleilaxu, persistent as festering sores, awaiting the day of Scytale’s Great Revival.\n“People grow strong under oppression,” he said, but there was no force in his words. “Even the Priests of Rakis are\nfinding holes in which to hide!” Desperate words.\n“Who says this? Some of your returned friends?”\nHis silence was all the answer she needed.\n“Bene Tleilax have killed Honored Matres and they know it,” she said, hammering at him. “They will be satisfied only with your extermination.”\n“And yours!”\n“We are partners by necessity if not by shared belief.” She said it in purest Islamiyat and saw hope leap into his eyes. Kehl and Shariat may yet take on their old meanings among people who compose their thoughts in the Language of God.\n“Partners?” Faint and extremely tentative.\nShe adopted new bluntness. “In some ways, that’s a more reliable basis for common action than any other. Each of us knows what the other wants. An instrinsic design: Screen everything through that and something reliable can occur.”\n“And what is it you want from me?”\n“You already know.”\n“How to make the finest tanks, yes.” He shook his head, obviously unsure. The changes implied by her demands!\nOdrade wondered if she dared snap at him in open anger. How dense he was! But he was close to panic. Old values had changed. Honored Matres were not the only source of turmoil. Scytale did not even know the extent of changes that had infected his own Scattered Ones!\n“Times are changing,” Odrade said.\nChange, what a disturbing word, he thought.\n“I must have my own Face Dancer attendants! And my own tanks?” Almost begging.\n“My Council and | will consider it.”\n“What is there to consider?” Throwing her own words at her.\n“You need only your own approval. | require approval of others.” She gave him a grim smile. “So you do get time to\nthink.” Odrade nodded to Tamalane, who summoned guards.\n“Back to the no-ship?” He spoke from the doorway, such a diminutive figure amidst burly guards.\n“But tonight you ride all the way.”\nHe gave a last lingering stare at the worm as he left.\nWhen Scytale and guards were gone, Sheeana said: “You were right not to press him. He was ready to panic.”\nBellonda entered. “Perhaps it would be best just to kill him.”\n“Bell! Get the holo and go through our meeting again. This time as a Mentat!”\nThat stopped her.\nTamalane chuckled.\n“You take too much joy in your Sister’s discomfiture, Tam,” Sheeana said.\nTamalane shrugged but Odrade was delighted. No more teasing of Bell?\n“When you spoke of Chapterhouse becoming another Dune, that was when he began to panic,” Bellonda said, her voice Mentat distant.\nOdrade had seen the reaction but had not yet made the association. This was a Mentat’s value: patterns and systems, building blocks. Bell sensed a pattern to Scytale’s behavior.\n“I ask myself: Is it the thing become real once more?” Bellonda said.\nOdrade saw it at once. An odd thing about lost places. As long as Dune had been a known and living planet, there existed a historical firmness about its presence in the Galactic Register. You could point to a projection and say: “That is Dune. Once called Arrakis and, latterly, Rakis. Dune for its total desert character in Muad’Dib’s day.”\nDestroy the place, though, and a mythological patina in- weighed against projected reality. In time, such places became totally mythic. Arthur and his Round Table. Camelot\nwhere it only rains at night. Pretty good Weather Control for those days!\nBut now, a new Dune had appeared.\n“Myth power,” Tamalane said.\nAhhhh, yes. Tam, close to her final departure from flesh, would be more sensitive to workings of myths. Mystery and secrecy, tools of the Missionaria, had been used also on Dune by Muad’Dib and the Tyrant. The seeds were planted. Even with priests of the Divided God gone to their own perdition, myths of Dune proliferated.\n“Melange,” Tamalane said.\nThe other Sisters in the workroom knew immediately what she meant. New hope could be injected into the Bene Gesserit Scattering.\nBellonda said: “Why do they want us dead and not captives? That has always puzzled me.”\nHonored Matres might not want any Bene Gesserit alive... only the spice knowledge, perhaps. But they destroyed Dune. They destroyed the Tleilaxu. It was a cautioning thought to take into any confrontation with the Spider Queen—should Dortujla succeed.\n“No useful hostages?” Bellonda asked.\nOdrade saw the looks on the faces of her Sisters. They were following a single track as though all of them thought with one mind. Object lessons by Honored Matres, leaving few survivors, only made potential opposition more cautious. It invoked a rule of silence within which bitter memories became bitter myths. Honored Matres were like barbarians in any age: blood instead of hostages. Strike with random viciousness.\n“Dar’s right,” Tamalane said. “We've been seeking allies too close to home.”\n“Futars did not create themselves,” Sheeana said.\n“The ones who created them hope to control us,” Bellonda said. There was the clear sound of Prime Projection\nin her voice. “That’s the hesitation Dortujla heard in the Handlers.”\nThere it was and they faced it", "axu.

There was the clear sound of Prime Projection\nin her voice. “That’s the hesitation Dortujla heard in the Handlers.”\nThere it was and they faced it with all of its perils. It came down to people (as it always did). People—contemporaries. You learned valuable things from people living in your own time and from knowledge they carried out of their pasts. Other Memory was not the only conveyance of history.\nOdrade felt that she had come home after a long absence. There was a familiarity about the way all four of them were thinking now. It was a familiarity that transcended place. The Sisterhood itself was Home. Not where they lodged in transient housing but the association.\nBellonda voiced it for them. “I fear we have been working at cross purposes.”\n“Fear does that,” Sheeana said.\nOdrade dared not smile. It could be misinterpreted and she did not want to explain. Give us Murbella as a Sister and a restored Bashar! Then we might have our fighting chance!\nRight there with that good feeling in her, the message signal clicked. She glanced at the projection surface, a pure reflex, and recognized crisis. Such a small thing (relatively) to precipitate crisis. Clairby mortally injured in a ’thopter crash. Mortal unless ... The unless was spelled out for her and it added up to cyborg. Her companions saw the message in reverse but you got good at reading mirrored information in here. They knew.\nWhere do we draw the line?\nBellonda, with her antique spectacles when she could have had artificial eyes or any of numerous other prosthetics, voted with her body. This is what it means to be human. Try to hold on to youth and it mocks you while it sprints away. Melange is enough... and perhaps too much.\nOdrade recognized what her own emotions were telling her. But what of Bene Gesserit necessity? Bell could lodge her individual vote and everyone recognized it, even\nrespected it. But Mother Superior’s vote carried the Sisterhood with her.\nFirst the axlotl tanks and now this.\nNecessity said they could not afford to lose specialists of Clairby’s caliber. They had few enough as it was. “Spread thin” did not describe it. Gaps were appearing. Cyborg Clairby, though, and that was the opening wedge.\nThe Suks were prepared. “A precautionary arrangement” should it be required for someone irreplaceable. Such as Mother Superior? Odrade knew she had approved that with her usual cautious reservations. Where were those reservations now?\nCyborg was one of those potpourri words, too. Where did mechanical additions to human flesh become dominant? When was the Cyborg no longer human? Temptations intensified—“Just this one little adjustment.” And so easy to adjust until the potpourri-human became unquestioningly obedient.\nBut... Clairby?\nConditions of extremis said, “Cyborg him!” Was the Sisterhood that desperate? She was forced to answer in the affirmative.\nThere it was then—decision not entirely out of her hands, but the ready excuse at hand. Necessity dictates It.\nThe Butlerian Jihad had left its indelible mark on humans. Fought and won... for then. And here was another battle in that long-ago conflict.\nBut now, survival of the Sisterhood was in the balance. How many technical specialists remained on Chapterhouse? She knew the answer without looking. Not enough.\nOdrade leaned forward and keyed for transmit. “Cyborg him,” she said.\nBellonda grunted. Approval or disapproval? She would never say. This was Mother Superior’s arena and welcome to it!\nWho won this battle? Odrade wondered.\nWe walk a delicate line, perpetuating Atreides (Siona) genes in our population because that hides us from prescience. We carry the Kwisatz Haderach in that bag! Willfulness created Muad’Dib. Prophets make predictions come true! Will we ever again dare ignore our Tao sense and cater to a culture that hates chance and begs for prophecy?\n—ARCHIVAL SUMMARY (ADIXTO)\nt was just after dawn when Odrade arrived at the no-ship but Murbella was up and working with a training mek when Mother Superior strode onto the practice floor.\nOdrade had walked the last klick through ring orchards around the spacefield. Night’s limited clouds had thinned at the approach of dawn, then dissipated to reveal a sky thick with stars.\nShe recognized a delicate weather shift to wrench another crop from this region but decreasing rainfall was barely enough to keep orchards and pastures alive.\nAs she walked, Odrade was overcome by dreariness. Winter just past had been a hard-bought silence between storms. Life was holocaust. Dusting of pollen by eager insects, fruiting and seeding that followed the flower. These orchards were a secret storm whose power lay hidden in torrential flows of life. But ohhh! the destruction. New life carried change. The Changer was coming, always different. Sandworms would bring the desert purity of ancient Dune.\nThe desolation of that transforming power invaded her imagination. She could picture this landscape reduced to windswept dunes, habitat for Leto II’s descendants.\nAnd the arts of Chapterhouse would undergo mutation— one civilization’s myths replaced by another’s.\nThe aura of these thoughts went with Odrade onto the practice floor and colored her mood as she watched Murbella complete a round of flashing exertion, then step back, panting.\nA thin scratch reddened the back of Murbella’s left hand where she had missed a move by the big mek. The automated trainer stood there in the center of the room like a golden pillar, its weapons flicking in and out—probing mandibles of an angry insect.\nMurbella wore tight green leotards and her exposed skin glistened with perspiration. Even with the prominent mounding of her pregnancy, she appeared graceful. Her skin glowed with health. It came from within, Odrade decided, partly the pregnancy but something more fundamental as well. This had impressed itself on Odrade at their first encounter, a thing Lucilla had remarked after capturing Murbella and rescuing Idaho from Gammu. Health lived below the surface in her, there like a lens to focus attention on a deep freshet of vitality.\nWe must have her!\nMurbella saw the visitor but refused to be interrupted.\nNot yet, Mother Superior. My baby is due soon but this body’s needs will continue.\nOdrade saw then that the mek was simulating anger, a programed response brought on by frustration of its circuitry. An extremely dangerous mode!\n“Good morning, Mother Superior.”\nMurbella’s voice came out modulated by her exertions as she dodged and twisted with that almost blinding speed she commanded.\nThe mek slashed and probed for her, its sensors darting and whirring in attempts to follow her movements.\nOdrade sniffed. To speak at such a time amplified the peril of the mek. Risk no distractions when you played this dangerous game. Enough!\nThe mek’s controls were in a large green wall panel to the right of the doorway. Murbella’s changes could be seen in the circuits—dangling wires, beamfields with memory crystals dislocated. Odrade reached up and stilled the mechanism.\nMurbella turned to face her.\n“Why did you change the circuitry?” Odrade demanded.\n“For the anger.”\n“Is that what Honored Matres do?”\n“As the twig is bent?” Murbella massaged her wounded hand. “But what if the twig knows how it is bent and approves?”\nOdrade felt sudden excitement. “Approves? Why?”\n“Because there’s something .. . grand about it.”\n“You follow your adrenaline high?”\n“You know it’s not that!” Murbella’s breathing returned to normal. She stood glaring at Odrade.\n“Then what is it?”\n“It's... being challenged to do more than you ever thought possible. You never suspected you could be this... this good, this expert and accomplished at anything.”\nOdrade concealed elation.\nMens sana in corpore sano. We have her at last!\nOdrade said: “But what a price you pay!”\n“Price?” Murbella sounded astonished. “As long as | have the capacity, I’m delighted to pay.”\n“Take what you want and pay for it?”\n“It’s your Bene Gesserit magic cornucopia: As | become increasingly accomplished, my ability to pay increases.”\n“Beware, Murbella. That cornucopia, as you call it, can become Pandora’s box.”\nMurbella knew the allusion. She stood quite still, her attention fixed on Mother Superior. “Oh?” The sound barely escaped.\n“Pandora’s box releases powerful distractions that waste energies of your life. You speak glibly of being ‘in the chute’\nand becoming a Reverend Mother but you still don’t know what that means nor what we want from you.”\n“Then it was never our sexual abilities you wanted.”\nOdrade moved eight paces forward, majestically deliberate. Once Murbella got on that subject there would be no stopping her short of the usual resolution—argument cut short by Mother Superior’s peremptory command.\n“Sheeana easily mastered your abilities,” Odrade said.\n“So you will use her on that child!”\nOdrade heard displeasure. It was a cultural residue. When did human sexuality begin? Sheeana, waiting now in the no- ship guard chambers, had been forced to deal with it. “/ hope you recognize the source of my reluctance and why I was so secretive, Mother Superior.”\n“I recognize that a Fremen society filled your mind with inhibitions before we took you in hand!”\nThat had cleared the air between them. But how was this exchange with Murbella to be redirected? / must /et it run while | seek a way out.\nThere would be repetition. Unresolved issues would emerge. The fact that almost every word Murbella uttered could be anticipated, that would be a trial.\n“Why do you evade this tested way of dominating others now that you say you need it with Teg?” Murbella asked.\n“Slaves, is that what you want?” Odrade countered.\nEyes almost closed, Murbella considered this. Did / consider the men our slaves? Perhaps. | produced in them periods of wildly unthinking abandon, a giving up to heights of ecstasy they had never dreamed possible. | was trained to give them that and, thereby, make them subject to our control.\nUntil Duncan did the same to me.\nOdrade saw the hooding of Murbella’s eyes and recognized there were things in this woman’s psyche twisted in a way difficult to uncover. Wi/dness running where we have not followed. It was as though Murbella’s original\nclarity had been stained indelibly and then that mark covered over and even this cover masked.

Wi/dness running where we have not followed. It was as though Murbella’s original\nclarity had been stained indelibly and then that mark covered over and even this cover masked. There was a harshness in her that distorted thoughts and actions. Layer upon layer upon layer...\n“You're afraid of what I can do,” Murbella said.\n“There’s truth in what you say,” Odrade agreed.\nHonesty and candor—limited tools now to be used with care.\n“Duncan.” Murbella’s voice came out flat with new Bene Gesserit abilities.\n“| fear what you share with him. You find it odd, Mother Superior admitting fear?”\n“I know about candor and honesty!” She made candor and honesty sound repellent.\n“Reverend Mothers are taught never to abandon self. We are trained not to encumber ourselves that way with concerns of others.”\n“Is that all of it?”\n“It goes deeper and has other threads. Being Bene Gesserit marks you in its own ways.”\n“I know what you’re asking: Choose Duncan or the Sisterhood. | know your tricks.”\n“I think not.”\n“There are things | won’t do!”\n“Each of us is constrained by a past. | make my choices, do what | must because my past is different from yours.”\n“You'll continue to train me despite what I’ve just said?”\nOdrade heard this in the total receptivity these encounters with Murbella demanded, every sense alerted to things not spoken, messages that hovered on edges of words as though they were cilia wavering there, reaching for contact with a dangerous universe.\nThe Bene Gesserit must change its ways. And here is one who could guide us into change.\nBellonda would be horrified at the prospect. Many Sisters would reject it. But there it was.\nWhen Odrade remained silent, Murbella said: “Trained. Is that the proper word?”\n“Conditioned. That’s probably more familiar to you.”\n“What you really want is to conjoin our experiences, make me sufficiently like you that we can create trust between us. That’s what all education does.”\nDon't play erudite games with me, girl!\n“We would flow in the same stream, eh, Murbella?”\nAny Third-Stage acolyte would have become watchfully cautious hearing that tone from Mother Superior. Murbella appeared unmoved. “Except that | will not give him up.”\n“That is for you to decide.”\n“Did you let the Lady Jessica decide?”\nThe way out of this cul-de-sac at last.\nDuncan had prompted Murbella to study Jessica’s life. Hoping to thwart us! Holos of his performance had ignited severe analysis of records.\n“An interesting person,” Odrade said.\n“Love! After all of your teaching, your conditioning!”\n“You did not think her behavior treasonous?”\n“Never!”\nDelicately now. “But look at consequences: a Kwisatz Haderach ... and that grandchild, the Tyrant!” Argument dear to Bellonda’s heart.\n“Golden Path,” Murbella said. “Survival of humankind.”\n“Famine Times and the Scattering.”\nAre you watching this, Bell? No matter. You will watch it.\n“Honored Matres!” Murbella said.\n“All because of Jessica?” Odrade asked. “But Jessica returned to the fold and lived out her years on Caladan.”\n“Teacher of acolytes!”\n“Example to them, as well. See what happens when you defy us?” Defy us, Murbella! Do it more adroitly than Jessica.\n“Sometimes you repel me!” Natural honesty forced her to add: “But you know | want what you have.”\nWhat we have.\nOdrade recalled her own first encounters with Bene Gesserit attractions. Everything of the body done with exquisite precision, senses honed to detect smallest details, muscles trained to perform in marvelous exactitude. These abilities in an Honored Matre could only add a new dimension amplified by bodily speed.\n“You're throwing it back on me,” Murbella said. “Trying to force my choice when you already know it.”\nOdrade remained silent. This was a form of argument ancient Jesuits had almost perfected. Simulflow Superimposed disputational patterns: Let Murbella do her own convincing. Supply only the most subtle of nudges. Give her small excuses upon which to enlarge.\nBut hold fast, Murbella, to love for Duncan!\n“You're very clever at parading your Sisterhood’s advantages past me,” Murbella said.\n“We are not a cafeteria line!”\nAn insoucient grin flicked Murbella’s mouth. “lIl take one of those and one of these and | think I’d like one of those creamy things over there.”\nOdrade enjoyed the metaphor but omnipresent watchers had their own appetites. “A diet that might kill you.”\n“But | see your offerings displayed so attractively. Voice! What a marvelous thing you’ve cooked up there. | have this wonderful instrument in my throat and you can teach me to play it in that ultimate way.”\n“Now, you're a concert master.”\n“I want your ability to influence those around me!”\n“To what end, Murbella? For whose goals?”\n“If | eat what you eat, will | grow into your kind of toughness: plasteel on the outside and even harder inside?”\n“Is that how you see me?”\n“The chef at my banquet! And | must eat whatever you bring—for my good and for yours.”\nShe sounded almost manic. An odd person. Sometimes she appeared to be the most wretched of women, pacing\nher quarters like a caged beast. That mad look in her eyes, orange flecks in the corneas. ..as there were now.\n“Do you still refuse to work on Scytale?”\n“Let Sheeana do it.”\n“Will you coach her?”\n“And she will use my coaching on the child!”\nThey stared at each other, realizing they shared a similar thought. This is not confrontation because each of us wants the other.\n“lam committed to you for what you can give me,” Murbella said, her voice low. “But you want to know if | may ever act against that commitment?”\n“Could you?”\n“No more than you could if circumstances demanded it.”\n“Do you think you will ever regret your decision?”\n“Of course | will!” What kind of damnfool question was that? People always had regrets. Murbella said this.\n“Just confirming your self-honesty. We like it that you don’t fly under false colors.”\n“You get false ones?”\n“Indeed.”\n“You must have ways of weeding them out.”\n“The Agony does that for us. Falsehoods don’t come through the Spice.”\nOdrade sensed Murbella’s drumbeat flickering faster.\n“And you're not going to demand | give up Duncan?” Very spiny.\n“That attachment presents difficulties, but they are your difficulties.”\n“Another way of asking me to give him up?”\n“Accept the possibility, that is all.”\n“| can’t”\n“You won't?”\n“I mean what I say. I’m incapable.”\n“And if someone showed you how?”\nMurbella stared into Odrade’s eyes for a long beat, then: almost said that would set me free... but...”\n“Yes?”\n“I could not be free while he was bound to me.”\n“Is that renunciation of Honored Matre ways?” “Renunciation? Wrong word. I’ve merely grown beyond my former Sisters.”\n“Former Sisters?”\n“Still my Sisters, but they’re Sisters of childhood. Some | remember fondly, some | dislike intensely. Playmates ina game that no longer interests me.”\n“That decision satisfies you?”\n“Are you Satisfied, Mother Superior?”\nOdrade clapped her hands with unrestrained elation. How swiftly Murbella acquired Bene Gesserit riposte!\n“Satisfied? What a hellishly deadly word!”\nAs Odrade spoke, Murbella felt herself move as ina dream to the edge of an abyss, unable to awaken and prevent the plunge. Her stomach ached with secret emptiness and Odrade’s next words came from echoing distance.\n“The Bene Gesserit is all to a Reverend Mother. You will never be able to forget that.”\nAs quickly as it had come, the dream sensation passed. Mother Superior’s next words were cold and immediate.\n“Prepare for more advanced training.”\nUntil you meet the Agony—live or die.\nOdrade lifted her gaze to the ceiling comeyes. “Send Sheeana in here. She begins at once with her new teacher.” “So you're going to do it! You’re going to work on that\nchild.”\n“Think of him as Bashar Teg,” Odrade said. “That helps.” And we’re not giving you time to reconsider.\n“| didn’t resist Duncan and | can’t argue with you.”\n“Don’t even argue with yourself, Murbella. Pointless. Teg was my father and still | must do this.”\na“\nUntil that moment, Murbella had not realized the force behind Odrade’s earlier statement. The Bene Gesserit is all to a Reverend Mother. Great Dur protect me! Will I be like that?\nWe witness a passing phase of eternity. Important things happen but some people never notice. Accidents intervene. You are not present at episodes. You depend on reports. And people shutter their minds. What good are reports? History in a news account? Preselected at an editorial conference, digested and excreted by prejudice? Accounts you need seldom come from those who make history. Diaries, memoirs and autobiographies are subjective forms of special pleading. Archives are crammed with such suspect stuff.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nS cytale noticed the excitement of guards and others when he reached the barrier at the end of his corridor. Rapid movement of people, especially this early in the day, had attracted him first and sent him to the barrier. There went that Suk doctor, Jalanto. He recognized her from the time Odrade had sent her “because you are looking ill.” Another Reverend Mother to spy on me!\nAhhhh, Murbella’s baby. That was why this rushing around and the Suk.\nBut who were all those others? Bene Gesserit robes in an abundance he had never before seen here. Not just acolytes. Reverend Mothers outnumbered the others he saw rushing about down there. They reminded him of great carrion birds. There went an acolyte at last, carrying a child on her shoulders. Very mysterious. /f only | had a link to Shipsystems!\nHe leaned against a wall and waited but the people vanished into various hatches and doorways. Some destinations he could place with fair certainty, others remained a mystery.\nBy the Holy Prophet! There went Mother Superior herself! She went through a wider doorway where most of the others\nhad gone.\nUseless to ask Odrade when next he saw her. She had him in her trap now.\nThe Prophet is here and in powindah hands!\nWhen"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_b5f292693c7f6927cf7f7a7db4f4646e57e0cc4aa8ca85cb03f07726b51f06b9_v2"}
