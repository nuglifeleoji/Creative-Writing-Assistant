\n　　在大家的哄笑声中，金富两兄弟和孙家的人都十分难堪。 \n　　好在这种红火时候；人们谁也不计较这种露骨的玩笑。 \n　　双水村大秧歌和小戏的总导演是孙少平。他在高中时就是全县出名的“把式”，还到黄原讲过故事，因此理所当然由他来指拨大家了。少平此刻跑出跑里，一会在教室排戏，一会又去院子指导大秧歌，真是出尽了风头……下午，路程最近的罐子村的秧歌队伍，已经开到了村头的彩门下。孙少安家土坡下面的公路上，前几天搭起的彩门五彩缤纷，并且缀满了翠绿的柏叶——为闹红火，金家破例让人在祖坟里折了一些柏树枝来装扮这门面。 \n　　罐子村的秧歌一到，双水村的队伍就立刻前去迎接。两队秧歌在彩门下相遇，热闹纷乱的气氛霎时达到了高潮，彩门两边的公路上锣鼓喧天，鞭炮声炸得人耳朵发麻。 \n　　两家的大秧歌队分别扭开了，公路上立刻成了一条七彩的长河。在罐子村的秧歌队里，王满银鼻子上画了块白颜色，身上斜挂着驴串铃，手里甩着绳刷子，丢腿撂胯地扮个“开路小丑”，逗引得娃娃们撵着看他出洋相。他老婆兰花昨天已经带着猫蛋狗蛋来到娘家门上，现在正挤在人堆里看热闹。这几天，双水村几乎所有在门外工作的干部和出嫁在外的女人，都赶回到亲爱的故乡来——他们有的情不自禁地上场露两手；不上场的就挤在人群中间如痴如醉地观看。在这些人中，我们只是没有发现田润叶。是的，她没有回村来。她眼下没有心思观看这红火热闹。她到黄原她的同学杜莉莉那里去了。 \n　　田福军夫妇正由福堂和村里的一些长者陪同着，站在彩门上面的一个土台上，兴致勃勃地观看着。女儿晓霞没有跟他们回来，留在城里照顾她外爷徐国强……现在，彩门两边的秧歌队已经纷纷编成了两根“蒜辫子”——这意味着两家的伞头要对秧歌了！ \n　　罐子村的伞头王明清，也是远近闻名的“铁嘴”，按规矩由他先给不可一世的田五发难。田五在彩门这边腰扭得象水蛇一般，伞头转成了一朵莲花，正准备接受王明清的挑战。只见王明清伞头轻轻一点，双方的锣鼓声便嘎然而止。王明清亮开嗓门唱道——锣鼓停声我开音，万有亲朋你细听：转九曲来到双水\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
