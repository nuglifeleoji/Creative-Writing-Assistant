The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!” Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a Slow thrust timed to enter a shield’s mindless defenses.\nHalleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest. “Speed, excellent,” he said. “But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.”\nPaul stepped back, chagrined.\n“I should whap your backside for such carelessness,” Halleck said. He lifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. “This in the hand of an enemy can let out your life’s blood! You’re an apt pupil, none better, but I’ve warned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his hand.”\n“I guess I’m not in the mood for it today,” Paul said.\n“Mood?” Halleck’s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield’s filtering. “What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises—no matter the mood! Mood’s a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It’s not for fighting.”\n“I’m sorry, Gurney.”\n“You're not sorry enough!”\nHalleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left hand, the rapier poised high in his right. “Now | say guard yourself for true!” He\nleaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.\nPaul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as Shield edges touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his Skin. What’s gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He’s not faking this! Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath.\n“You see a need for an extra blade, eh?” Halleck grunted.\nIs this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!\nAround the room they fought—thrust and parry, feint and counter-feint. The air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the Slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new shield contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.\nPaul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise table. /f / can turn him beside the table, l'Il show him a trick, Paul thought. One more step, Gurney.\nHalleck took the step.\nPaul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck’s rapier catch against the table’s edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in across Halleck’s neckline with the bodkin. He Stopped the blade an inch from the jugular.\n“Is this what you seek?” Paul whispered.\n“Look down, lad,” Gurney panted.\nPaul obeyed, saw Halleck’s kindjal thrust under the table’s edge, the tip almost touching Paul’s groin.\n“We'd have joined each other in death,” Halleck said. “But l'Il admit you fought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood.” And he grinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.\n“The way you came at me,” Paul said. “Would you really have drawn my blood?”\nHalleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. “If you’d fought one whit beneath your abilities, l’d have scratched you a good one, a scar you’d remember. l'Il not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who happens along.”\nPaul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. “I deserved that, Gurney. But it would’ve angered my father if you’d hurt me. l'Il not have you punished for my failing.”\n“As to that,” Halleck said, “it was my failing, too. And you needn’t worry about a training scar or two. You're lucky you have so few. As to your father—the Duke’d punish me only if | failed to make a first-class fighting man out of you. And I'd have been failing there if | hadn’t explained the fallacy in this mood thing you’ve suddenly developed.”\nPaul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.\n“It’s not exactly play we do here,” Halleck said.\nPaul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness in Halleck’s manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored inkvine scar on the man’s jaw, remembering the\nstory of how it had been put there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even for an instant. It occurred to Paul, then, that the making of Halleck’s scar had been accompanied by pain—a pain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this thought aside; it chilled their world.\n“I guess | did hope for some play today,” Paul said. “Things are so serious around here lately.”\nHalleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes. There was pain in him —like a blister, all that was left of some lost yesterday that Time had pruned off him.\nHow soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon he must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line: “Please list your next of kin.”\nHalleck spoke without turning: “I sensed the play in you, lad, and I'd like nothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.”\nPaul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.\nHalleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He gestured to the practice dummy. “Now, we'll work on your timing. Let me see you catch that thing sinister. l'Il control it from over here where I can have a full view of the action. And | warn you l'Il be trying new counters today. There’s a warning you'd not get from a real enemy.”\nPaul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He crossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away.\n“En garde!” Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack.\nPaul activated his shield, parried and countered.\nHalleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in fly-buzz.\nI’m the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted onto me—all bearing for someone else to pick.\nFor some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in his mind. But she was dead now—in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She had loved pansies...or was it daisies? He couldn’t remember. It bothered him that he couldn’t remember.\nPaul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand entretisser.\nThe clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul’s interweaving hand motions. He’s been practicing and studying on his own. That’s not Duncan style, and it’s certainly nothing I’ve taught him.\nThis thought only added to Halleck’s sadness. /’m infected by mood, he thought. And he began to\nwonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night.\n“If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets,” he murmured.\nIt was his mother’s expression and he always used it when he felt the blackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that was to be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.\nYUEH (yu ‘é), Wellington (weling-tun), Stdrd 10,082- 10,191; medical doctor of the Suk School (grd Stdrd 10,112); md: Wanna Marcus, B.

He felt deliciously relaxed after the workout with Gurney Halleck.\n“You do look comfortable,” said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.\nPaul raised his head, saw the man’s stick figure Standing several paces away, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block of a head with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of Imperial Conditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the Suk School’s silver ring at the left shoulder.\n“You'll be happy to hear we haven’t time for regular lessons today,” Yueh said. “Your father will be along presently.”\nPaul sat up.\n“However, l’ve arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several lessons during the crossing to Arrakis.”\n“Oh.”\nPaul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father would be coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor’s command to take over the fief of Arrakis.\nYueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: / must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.\nPaul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. “What’ll | be studying on the way across?”\n“Ah-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have opened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It’s not clear how. | must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive—a Dr. Kynes— and offer my help in the investigation.”\nAnd Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.\n“Will there be something on the Fremen?” Paul asked.\n“The Fremen?” Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.\n“Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,” Paul said.\n“Yes, to be sure,” Yueh said. “There are two general separations of the people—Fremen, they are\none group, and the others are the people of the graben, the sink, and the pan. There’s some intermarriage, I’m told. The women of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives.
