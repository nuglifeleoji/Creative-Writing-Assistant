The ruined man had recognized him quickly.\n“Where do the Honored Matres hunt for me now?” Teg asked.\n“Everywhere, Bashar. We cannot guarantee your safety but steps are being taken. | will make it known where | have delivered you.”\n“Do they say why they hunt me?”\n“They never explain, Bashar.”\n“How long have they been on Gammu?”\n“Too long, sir. Since | was a child and | was a baltern at Renditai.”\nA hundred years at least, Teg thought. Time to gather many forces into their hands... if Taraza’s fears were to be credited.\nTeg credited them.\n“Trust no one those whores can influence,” Taraza had said.\nTeg sensed no threat to him in his present position, though. He could only absorb the secrecy that obviously enclosed him now. He did not press for more details.\nThey were well into Ysai and he glimpsed the black bulk of the ancient Harkonnen seat of Barony through occasional\ngaps between the walls that enclosed the great private residences. The car turned onto a street of small commercial establishments: cheap buildings constructed for the most part of salvaged materials that displayed their origins in poor fits and unmatched colors. Gaudy signs advised that the wares inside were the finest, the repair services better than those elsewhere.\nIt was not that Ysai had deteriorated or even gone to seed, Teg thought. Growth here had been diverted into something worse than ugly. Someone had chosen to make this place repellent. That was the key to most of what he Saw in the city.\nTime had not stopped here, it had retreated. This was no modern city full of bright transport pods and insulated usiform buildings. This was random jumbles, ancient structures joined to ancient structures, some built to individual tastes and some obviously designed with some long-gone necessity in mind. Everything about Ysai was joined in a proximity whose disarray just managed to avoid chaos. What saved it, Teg knew, was the old pattern of thoroughfares along which this hodgepodge had been assembled. Chaos was held at bay, although what pattern there was in the streets conformed to no master plan. Streets met and crossed at odd angles, seldom squared. Seen from the air, the place was a crazy quilt with only the giant black rectangle of ancient Barony to speak of an organizing plan. The rest of it was architectural rebellion.\nTeg saw suddenly that this place was a lie plastered over with other lies, based on previous lies, and such a mad mixup that they might never dig through to a usable truth. All of Gammu was that way. Where could such insanity have had its beginnings? Was it the Harkonnens’ doing?\n“We are here, sir.”\nThe driver drew up to the curb in front of a windowless building face, all flat black plasteel and with a single ground- level door. No salvaged material in this construction. Teg\nrecognized the place: the bolt hole he had chosen. Unidentified things flickered in Teg’s second vision but he sensed no immediate menace. The driver opened Teg’s door and stood to one side.\n“Not much activity here at this hour, sir. | would get inside quickly.”\nWithout a backward glance, Teg darted across the narrow walk and into the building—a small brightly lighted foyer of polished white plaz and only banks of comeyes to greet him. He ducked into a lift tube and punched the remembered coordinates. This tube, he knew, angled upward through the building to the fifty-seventh floor rear where there were some windows. He remembered a private dining room of dark reds and heavy brown furnishings, a hard-eyed female with the obvious signs of Bene Gesserit training, but no Reverend Mother.\nThe tube disgorged him into the remembered room but there was no one to receive him. Teg glanced around at the solid brown furnishings. Four windows along the far wall were concealed behind thick maroon draperies.\nTeg knew he had been seen. He waited patiently, using his newly learned doubling-vision to anticipate trouble. There was no indication of attack. He took up a position to one side of the tube outlet and glanced around him once more.\nTeg had a theory about the relationship between rooms and their windows—the number of windows, their placement, their size, height from the floor, relationship of room size to window size, the elevation of the room, windows curtained or draped, and all of this Mentat- interpreted against knowledge of the uses to which a room was put. Rooms could be fitted to a kind of pecking order defined with extreme sophistication. Emergency uses might throw such distinctions out the window but they otherwise were quite reliable.\nLack of windows in an aboveground room conveyed a particular message. If humans occupied such a room, it did not necessarily mean secrecy was the main goal. He had seen unmistakable signs in scholastic settings that windowless schoolrooms were both a retreat from the exterior world and a strong statement of dislike for children.\nThis room, however, presented something different: conditional secrecy plus the need to keep occasional watch on that exterior world. Protective secrecy when required. His opinion was reinforced when he crossed the room and twitched one of the draperies aside. The windows were tripled armor-plaz. So! Keeping watch on that world outside might draw attack. That was the opinion of whoever had ordered the room protected this way.\nOnce more, Teg twitched the drapery aside. He glanced at the corner glazing. Prismatic reflectors there amplified the view along the adjacent wall to both sides and from roof to ground.\nWell!\nHis previous visit had not given him time for this closer examination but now he made a more positive assessment. A very interesting room. Teg dropped the drapery and turned just in time to see a tall man enter from the tube Slot.\nTeg’s doubled vision provided a firm prediction on the stranger. This man brought concealed danger. The newcomer was plainly military—the way he carried himself, the quick eye for details that only a trained and experienced officer would observe. And there was something else in his manner that made Teg stiffen. This was a betrayer! A mercenary available to the highest bidder.\n“Damned nasty the way they treated you,” the man greeted Teg. The voice was a deep baritone with an unconscious assumption of personal power in it. The accent was one Teg had never before heard. This was someone from the Scattering! A Bashar or equivalent, Teg estimated.\nStill, there was no indication of immediate attack.\nWhen Teg did not answer, the man said: “Oh, sorry: I’m Muzzafar. Jafa Muzzafar, regional commander for the forces of Dur.”\nTeg had never heard of the forces of Dur.\nQuestions crowded Teg’s mind but he kept them to himself. Anything he said here might betray weakness.\nWhere were the people who had met him here before? Why did I choose this place? The decision had been made with such inner assurance.\n“Please be comfortable,” Muzzafar said, indicating a small divan with a low serving table in front of it. “I assure you that none of what has happened to you was of my doing. Tried to put a stop to it when | heard but you'd already... left the scene.”\nTeg heard the other thing in this Muzzafar’s voice now: caution bordering on fear. So this man had either heard about or seen the shack and the clearing.\n“Damned clever of you,” Muzzafar said. “Having your attack force wait until your captors were concentrating on trying to get information out of you. Did they learn anything?”\nTeg shook his head silently from side to side. He felt on the edge of being ignited in a blurred response to attack, yet he sensed no immediate violence here. What were these Lost Ones doing? But Muzzafar and his people had made a wrong assessment of what had happened in the room of the T-probe. That was clear.\n“Please, be seated,” Muzzafar said.\nTeg took the proffered seat on the divan.\nMuzzafar sat in a deep chair facing Teg at a slight angle on the other side of the serving table. There was a crouching sense of alertness in Muzzafar. He was prepared for violence.\nTeg studied the man with interest. Muzzafar had revealed no real rank—only commander. Tall fellow with a wide, ruddy\nface and a big nose. The eyes were gray-green and had the trick of focusing just behind Teg’s right shoulder when either of them spoke. Teg had known a spy once who did that.\n“Well, well,” Muzzafar said. “I’ve read and heard a great deal about you since coming here.”\nTeg continued to study him silently. Muzzafar’s hair had been cropped close and there was a purple scar about three millimeters long across the scalp line above the left eye. He wore an open bush jacket of light green and matching trousers—not quite a uniform but there was a neatness about him that spoke of customary spit and polish. The shoes attested to this. Teg thought he probably could see his own reflection in their light brown surfaces if he bent close.\n“Never expected to meet you personally, of course,” Muzzafar said. “Consider it a great honor.”\n“I know very little about you except that you command a force from the Scattering,” Teg said.\n“Mmmmmph! Not much to know, really.”\nOnce more, hunger pangs gripped Teg. His gaze went to the button beside the tube slot, which, he remembered, would summon a waiter. This was a place where humans did the work usually assigned to automata, an excuse for keeping a large force assembled at the ready.\nMisinterpreting Teg’s interest in the tube slot, Muzzafar said: “Please don’t think of leaving. Having my own medic come in to take a look at you. Shouldn’t be but a moment. Appreciate it if you’d wait quietly until he arrives.”\n“I was merely thinking of placing an order for some food,” Teg said.\n“Advise you to wait until the doctor’s had his look-see. Stunners leave some nasty aftereffects.”\n“So you know about that.”\n“Know about the whole damned fiasco. You and your man Burzmali are a force to be reckoned with.”\nBefore Teg could respond, the tube slot disgorged a tall man in a jacketed red singlesuit, a man so bone-skinny that his clothing gaped and flapped about him. The diamond tattoo of a Suk doctor had been burned into his high forehead but the mark was orange and not the customary black. The doctor’s eyes were concealed by a glistening orange cover that hid their true color.\nAn addict of some kind? Teg wondered. There was no smell of the familiar narcotics around him, not even melange. There was a tart smell, though, almost like some fruit.\n“There you are, Solitz!” Muzzafar said. He gestured at Teg. “Give him a good scan. Stunner hit him day before yesterday.”\nSolitz produced a recognizable Suk scanner, compact and fitting into one hand. Its probe field produced a low hum.\n“So you’re a Suk doctor,” Teg said, looking pointedly at the orange brand on the forehead.\n“Yes, Bashar. My training and conditioning are the finest in our ancient tradition.”\n“I’ve never seen the identifying mark in that color,” Teg said.\nThe doctor passed his scanner around Teg’s head. “The color of the tattoo makes no difference, Bashar. What is behind it is all that matters.” He lowered the scanner to Teg’s shoulders, then down across the body.\nTeg waited for the humming\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b13cc03a4343483fe6ebda1048385b6d2e96908b7adb15c33518206a3a81c1cf_v2"}
