\n　　当他急切地跑回家，扑上炕，看着自己的亲骨肉一对黑溜溜的眼睛望着他的时候，他就忍不住欣喜得鼻子一酸，他赶忙俯身去亲吻儿子的小脸蛋，却让秀莲把他的头掀在一边。妻子嗔怒地说：“你那副嘴巴把娃娃都亲疼了！”他也就嘿嘿笑着退开了。他的秀莲更丰满了，圆脸红润润的，带着做了母亲的幸福——多么满足啊！ \n　　但是，当无比欢欣的情绪过去以后，生活本身的沉重感就向他袭来了。 \n　　现在，孙少安更加痛切地感到，这光景日月过得太硒惶了！儿子来到这个世界上，他作为父亲，能给予他什么呢？别说让他享福了，连口饭都不能给他吃饱！这算什么父亲啊……连自己的老婆和孩子都养活不了，庄稼人活得还有什么脸面呢？生活是如此无情，它使一个劳动者连起码的尊严都不能保持！ \n　　按说，他年轻力壮，一年四季在山里挣命劳动，从来也没有亏过土地，可到头来却常常是两手空空。他家现在尽管有三个好劳力，但一家人仍然穷得叮当响。当然，村里的其他人家，除过少数几户，大部分也都不比他们的光景强多少。农民的日子，难道就要永远这样穷下去？这世事难道就不能有个改变？ \n　　作为一个整天和土地打交道并以此为生的人，孙少安知道，这一切不幸都是一村人在一个锅里搅稠稀造成的。说句反动话，如果让他单干种庄稼，他孙少安就不相信一家人连饭也吃不饱！ \n　　有一天，他突然想起，前不久他到石圪节赴集时，听安徽跑出来谋生的一个铁匠说，他们那里有的村子，现在把生产队划成了小组，搞了承包制，超产还带奖励呢；结果庄稼都比往年营务得好，农民不仅吃饱了饭，还有了余粮。少安当时象听神话传说一样，把安徽铁匠的话没当一回事。吹牛哩！难道你安徽就不是中国的地方？ \n　　现在，他心想：也许真有这事哩！这办法当然好嘛！这样一搞，就肯定没耍奸溜滑的人了。而现在一群人混在一起，干多干少大家都一样，因此谁都不出力，结果一年下来都受穷！ \n　　少安马上心血来潮地思量他领导的生产队能不能也这样搞？ \n　　他尽管只有高小文化程度，又是个农民，但他凭直觉，感到“四人帮”打倒一年多来，社会已经开始有某些变化的迹象了。平时，少平经常看报纸，也给他透了不少外面的消息和国家大事。他知道，现在又提倡学雷锋了，上大学也不再是推荐，而是象文化革命前一样要考试：并且还提倡学\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
