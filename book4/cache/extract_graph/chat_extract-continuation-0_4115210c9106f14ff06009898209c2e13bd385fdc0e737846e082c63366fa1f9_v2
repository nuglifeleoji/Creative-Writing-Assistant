\n　　少平怀着无限温暖的感情，把哥哥给他的钱装在贴胸的衣袋里。 \n　　他一直把哥哥送上了开往米家镇的长途公共汽车。 \n　　当汽车走远了的时候，他眼里忍不住涌上了两团热乎乎的泪水…… \n　　孙少平送走哥哥后，怅怅然回到黄原宾馆的停车场，骑上田晓霞的自行车，去了师专——他要把自行车还给晓霞。晓霞碰巧不在宿舍。他要赶回去上工，顾不得再去找她，就把车子安咐给她同宿舍的人。 \n　　少平怀着一种踏实的心情，一路步行着从北关回到了南关的柴油机厂。他准备把挎包送回他住的地方，然后就去上工——起码还能赚半天工钱！ \n　　当他进了自己那个门窗洞开的房间后，吃惊地站住了。 \n　　他看见，麦秸草上的铺盖焕然一新。一块新褥子压在他的旧褥子上，上面蒙了一块淡雅的花格子床单；那块原来的破被子上摞着一床绿底白花的新被子……一切都象童话一般不可思议！ \n　　孙少平刹那间便明白了这是怎么一回事。他一下子忘情地扑倒在地铺上，把脸深深地埋进被子里，流着泪久久地吸吮着那股芬芳的香味……很长时间，他才从被子上爬起来；同时在枕头边发现了一张二指宽的小纸条。纸条上写着：不要见怪，不要见外。田。 \n　　孙少平用手指头轻轻抹去了脸上的泪珠，迅速换上了那身脏衣服，便象孩子一般蹦跳着下了楼，大踏步向工地走去…… \n                  第45章\n　　端阳节前后，石圪节搞了个物资交流大会——农民俗称“骡马大会”。 \n　　哈呀，在这个小街镇的历史上还没有过如此的红火热闹！几天以来，肩挑手提的庄稼人源源不断地涌到了这地方；石圪节的那条土街从早到晚人群挤得水泄不通。土街下面的东拉河沟道里，到处拴着牛、羊、猪、骡、马、驴等等的牲畜。生意人三个一伙，五个一群，带着一脸的诡秘，在袖简里，在草帽下，捏码子搞交易。东拉河小桥的两头，蔬菜、粮食和各种农副产品一直摆到了两边的井坡上；甚至都挤上了河对面的公路……赶会的庄稼人已经远远超出了石圪节公社的范围，许多人都是从外公社和外县跑来的。至于本公社的庄稼人，就是什么买卖也不做，至少要腾出一天时间来赶一赶这多年不遇的红火热闹。 \n　　最吸引人的地方当然是在戏场里。这种物资交流会没有不请剧团来演戏的。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character who experiences emotional
