The Jun brothers express a strong reluctance to leave these cave dwellings, indicating their emotional attachment and the importance of these structures in their family history. \n\nHowever, the current condition of the窑洞 poses a serious concern. The cave dwellings have been repurposed as classrooms for a school, but they have suffered damage due to an earthquake, resulting in cracks that have rendered them dangerous for use. This situation highlights a critical dilemma: while the窑洞 are cherished by the Jun brothers and represent their heritage, the safety of the current occupants, including students, is at risk due to the structural integrity of the buildings.\n\nIn summary, the窑洞 are not only a symbol of the Jun brothers' ancestral legacy but also serve a practical purpose as educational spaces.
