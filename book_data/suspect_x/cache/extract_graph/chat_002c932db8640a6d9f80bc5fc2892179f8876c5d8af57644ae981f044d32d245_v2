Fists were raised, Shaken.\n“What is he doing?” Farad’n whispered.\n“I wish | knew,” Alia said. She put a hand to her breast, feeling the fearful excitement of this moment. The crowd would turn upon the pilgrims if he kept this up!\nBut The Preacher half turned, aimed his dead sockets toward the Temple and raised a hand to point at the high windows of Alia’s aerie. “One blasohemy remains!” he screamed. “Blasphemy! And the name of that blasphemy is Alia!”\nShocked silence gripped the plaza.\nAlia stood in unmoving consternation. She knew the mob could not see her, but she felt overcome by a sense of exposure, of vulnerability. The echoes of calming words within her skull competed with the pounding of her heart. She could only stare down at that incredible tableau. The Preacher remained with a hand pointing at her windows.\nHis words had been too much for the Priests, though. They broke the silence with angry shouts, stormed down the steps, thrusting people aside. As they moved the crowd reacted, breaking like a wave upon the steps, sweeping over the first lines of onlookers, carrying The Preacher before\nthem. He stumbled blindly, separated from his young guide. Then a yellow-clad arm arose from the press of people; a crysknife was brandished in its hand. She saw the knife strike downward, bury itself in The Preacher’s chest.\nThe thunderous clang of the Temple’s giant doors being closed broke Alia from her shock. Guards obviously had closed the doors against the mob. But people already were drawing back, making an open space around a crumpled figure on the steps. An eerie quiet fell over the plaza. Alia Saw many bodies, but only this one lay by itself.\nThen a voice screeched from the mob: “Muad’Dib! They’ve killed Muad’Dib!”\n“Gods below,” Alia quavered. “Gods below.”\n“A little late for that, don’t you think?” Jessica asked.\nAlia whirled, noting the sudden startled reaction of Farad’n as he saw the rage on her face. “That was Paul they killed!” Alia screamed. “That was your son! When they confirm it, do you know what'll happen?”\nJessica stood rooted for a long moment, thinking that she had just been told something already known to her. Farad’n’s hand upon her arm shattered the moment. “My Lady,” he said, and there was such compassion in his voice that Jessica thought she might die of it right there. She looked from the cold, glaring anger on Alia’s face to the sympathetic misery on Farad’n’s features, and thought: Perhaps | did my job too well.\nThere could be no doubting Alia’s words. Jessica remembered every intonation of The Preacher's voice, hearing her own tricks in it, the long years of instruction she’d spent there upon a young man meant to be Emperor, but who now lay a shattered mound of bloody rags upon the Temple steps.\nGhafla blinded me, Jessica thought.\nAlia gestured to one of her aides, called: “Bring Ghanima now.”\nJessica forced herself into recognizing these words. Ghanima? Why Ghanima now?\nThe aide had turned toward the outer door, motioning for it to be unbarred, but before a word could be uttered the door bulged. Hinges popped. The bar snapped and the door, a thick plasteel construction meant to withstand terrible energies, toppled into the room. Guards leaped to avoid it, drawing their weapons.\nJessica and Farad’n’s bodyguards closed in around the Corrino Prince.\nBut the opening revealed only two children: Ghanima on the left, clad in her black betrothal robe, and Leto on the right, the grey slickness of a stillsuit beneath a desert- stained white robe.\nAlia stared from the fallen door to the children, found she was trembling uncontrollably.\n“The family here to greet us,” Leto said. “Grandmother.” He nodded to Jessica, shifted his attention to the Corrino Prince. “And this must be Prince Farad’n. Welcome to Arrakis, Prince.”\nGhanima’s eyes appeared empty. She held her right hand on a ceremonial crysknife at her waist, and she appeared to be trying to escape from Leto’s grip on her arm. Leto shook her arm and her whole body shook with it.\n“Behold me, family,” Leto said. “I am Ari, the Lion of the Atreides. And here—” Again he shook Ghanima’s arm with that powerful ease which set her whole body jerking. “— here is Aryeh, the Atreides Lioness. We come to set you onto Secher Nbiw, the Golden Path.”\nGhanima, absorbing the trigger words, Secher Nbiw, felt the locked-away consciousness flow into her mind. It flowed with a linear nicety, the inner awareness of her mother hovering there behind it, a guardian at a gate. And Ghanima knew in that instant that she had conquered the clamorous past. She possessed a gate through which she could peer when she needed that past. The months of self-hypnotic\nSuppression had built for her a safe place from which to manage her own flesh. She started to turn toward Leto with the need to explain this when she became aware of where she stood and with whom.\nLeto released her arm.\n“Did our plan work?” Ghanima whispered.\n“Well enough,” Leto said.\nRecovering from her shock, Alia shouted at a clump of guards on her left: “Seize them!”\nBut Leto bent, took the fallen door with one hand, skidded it across the room into the guards. Two were pinned against the wall. The others fell back in terror. That door weighed half a metric ton and this child had thrown it.\nAlia, growing aware that the corridor beyond the doorway contained fallen guards, realized that Leto must have dealt with them, that this child had shattered her impregnable door.\nJessica, too, had seen the bodies, seen the awesome power in Leto and had made similar assumptions, but Ghanima’s words touched a core of Bene Gesserit discipline which forced Jessica to maintain her composure. This grandchild spoke of a plan.\n“What plan?” Jessica asked.\n“The Golden Path, our Imperial plan for our Imperium,” Leto said. He nodded to Farad’n. “Don’t think harshly of me, cousin. | act for you as well. Alia hoped to have Ghanima Slay you. I’d rather you lived out your life in some degree of happiness.”\nAlia screamed at her guards cowering in the passage: “I command you to seize them!”\nBut the guards refused to enter the room.\n“Wait for me here, sister,” Leto said. “I have a disagreeable task to perform.” He moved across the room toward Alia.\nShe backed away from him into a corner, crouched and drew her knife. The green jewels of its handle flashed in the\nlight from the window.\nLeto merely continued his advance, hands empty, but spread and ready.\nAlia lunged with the knife.\nLeto leaped almost to the ceiling, struck with his left foot. It caught Alia’s head a glancing blow and sent her sprawling with a bloody mark on her forehead. She lost her grip on the knife and it skidded across the floor. Alia scrambled after the knife, but found Leto standing in front of her.\nAlia hesitated, called up everything she knew of Bene Gesserit training. She came off the floor, body loose and poised.\nOnce more Leto advanced upon her.\nAlia feinted to the left but her right shoulder came up and her right foot shot out in a toe-pointing kick which could disembowel a man if it struck precisely.\nLeto caught the blow on his arm, grabbed the foot, and picked her up by it, swinging her around his head. The speed with which he swung her sent a flapping, hissing sound through the room as her robe beat against her body.\nThe others ducked away.\nAlia screamed and screamed, but still she continued to swing around and around and around. Presently she fell silent.\nSlowly Leto reduced the speed of her whirling, dropped her gently to the floor. She lay in a panting bundle.\nLeto bent over her. “I could’ve thrown you through a wall,” he said. “Perhaps that would’ve been best, but we’re now at the center of the struggle. You deserve your chance.”\nAlia’s eyes darted wildly from side to side.\n“I have conquered those inner lives,” Leto said. “Look at Ghani. She, too, can—”\nGhanima interrupted: “Alia, | can show you—”\n“No!” The word was wrenched from Alia. Her chest heaved and voices began to pour from her mouth. They\nwere disconnected, cursing, pleading. “You see! Why didn’t you listen?” And again: “Why’re you doing this? What’s happening?” And another voice: “Stop them! Make them\nstop!” Jessica covered her eyes, felt Farad’n’s hand steady her. Still Alia raved: “lIl kill you!” Hideous curses erupted from her. “l'Il drink your blood!” The sounds of many languages\nbegan to pour from her, all jumbled and confused.\nThe huddled guards in the outer passage made the sign of the worm, then held clenched fists beside their ears. She was possessed!\nLeto stood, shaking his head. He stepped to the window and with three swift blows shattered the supposedly unbreakable crystal-reinforced glass from its frame.\nA sly look came over Alia’s face. Jessica heard something like her own voice come from that twisting mouth, a parody of Bene Gesserit control. “All of you! Stay where you are!”\nJessica, lowering her hands, found them damp with tears.\nAlia rolled to her knees, lurched to her feet.\n“Don’t you know who | am?” she demanded. It was her old voice, the sweet and lilting voice of the youthful Alia who was no more. “Why’re you all looking at me that way?” She turned pleading eyes to Jessica. “Mother, make them stop it.”\nJessica could only shake her head from side to side, consumed by ultimate horror. All of the old Bene Gesserit warnings were true. She looked at Leto and Ghani standing side by side near Alia. What did those warnings mean for these poor twins?\n“Grandmother,” Leto said, and there was pleading in his voice. “Must we have a Trial of Possession?”\n“Who are you to speak of trial?” Alia asked, and her voice was that of a querulous man, an autocratic and sensual man far gone in self-indulgence.\nBoth Leto and Ghanima recognized the voice. The Old Baron Harkonnen. Ghanima heard the same voice begin to\necho in her own head, but the inner gate closed and she sensed her mother standing there.\nJessica remained silent.\n“Then the decision is mine,” Leto said. “And the choice is yours, Alia. Trial of Possession, or...” He nodded toward the open window.\n“Who’re you to give me a choice?” Alia demanded, and it was still the voice of the Old Baron.\n“Demon!” Ghanima screamed. “Let her make her own choice!”\n“Mother,” Alia pleaded in her little-girl tones. “Mother, what’re they\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_002c932db8640a6d9f80bc5fc2892179f8876c5d8af57644ae981f044d32d245_v2"}
