Have you lost all sense of caution?”\n“I am concerned about you! Have you any idea what they’re saying in the City?”\n“I’m fully aware of the stories.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“You know, Moneo, | think that only the old pantheists had the right idea about deities: mortal foibles in immortal guise.”\nMoneo raised both arms to the heavens. “I saw the looks on their faces!” He lowered his arms. “It'll be all over the Empire within two weeks.”\n“Surely it'll take longer than that.”\n“If your enemies needed one thing to bring them all together...”\n“The defiling of the god is an ancient human tradition, Moneo. Why should | be an exception?”\nMoneo tried to speak, found he could not utter a word. He stamped down along the edge of the pit which held Leto’s cart, stamped back and resumed his former position glaring into Leto’s face.\n“If I am to help you, | need an explanation,” Moneo said. “Why are you doing this?”\n“Emotions.”\nMoneo’s mouth formed the word without speaking it.\n“They have come over me just when | thought them gone forever,” Leto said. “How sweet these last few sips of humanity are.”\n“With Hwi? But you surely cannot...”\n“Memories of emotions are never enough, Moneo.”\n“Are you telling me that you are indulging yourself in Buf at “Indulgence? Certainly not! But the tripod upon which Eternity swings is composed of flesh and thought and emotion. | felt that | had been reduced to flesh and thought.”\n“She has worked some kind of witchery,” Moneo accused.\n“Of course she has. And how grateful | am for it. If we deny the need for thought, Moneo, as some do, we lose the powers of reflection; we cannot define what our senses report. If we deny the flesh, we unwheel the vehicle which bears us. But if we deny emotion, we lose all touch with our internal universe. It was emotions which | missed the most.”\n“lL insist, Lord, that you...”\n“You are making me angry, Moneo. That /s an emotion.” Leto saw Moneo’s frustrated fury cool, quenched like a hot iron plunged into icy water. There was still some steam\nin him, though.\n“| care not for myself, Lord. My concern is mostly for you, and you know this.”\nLeto spoke softly. “It is your emotion, Moneo, and | hold it dear.”\nMoneo inhaled a deep, trembling breath. He had never before seen the God Emperor in this mood, reflecting this emotion. Leto appeared both elated and resigned, if Moneo were reading it correctly. One could not be certain.\n“That which makes life sweet for the living,” Leto said, “that which makes life warm and filled with beauty, that is what | would preserve even though it were denied to me.”\n“Then this Hwi Noree.. .”\n“She makes me recall the Butlerian Jihad in a poignant way. She is the antithesis of all that’s mechanical and non- human. How odd it is, Moneo, that the Ixians, of all people, Should produce this one person who so perfectly embodies those qualities which | hold most dear.”\n“I do not understand your reference to the Butlerian Jihad, Lord. Machines that think have no place in...”\n“The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,” Leto said. “Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.”\n“Lord, | still resent the fact that you welcome this...”\n“Moneo! Hwi reassures me merely by her presence. For the first time in centuries, | am not lonely unless she is away from my side. If | had no other proof of the emotion, this would serve.”\nMoneo fell silent, obviously touched by Leto’s evocation of loneliness. Surely, Moneo could understand the absence of the intimate sharing in love. His expression betrayed as much.\nFor the first time in a long while, Leto noted how much Moneo had aged.\nIt happens so suddenly to them, Leto thought.\nIt made Leto deeply aware of how much he cared for Moneo.\n| should not let attachments happen to me, but I cannot help it... especially now that Hwi is here.\n“They will laugh at you and make obscene jests,” Moneo said.\n“That is a good thing.”\n“How can it be good?”\n“This is something new. Our task has always been to bring the new into balance and, with it, modify behavior while not suppressing survival.”\n“Even so, how can you welcome this?”\n“The making of obscenities?” Leto asked. “What is the opposite of obscenity?”\nMoneo’s eyes went wide with a sudden questioning awareness. He had seen the action of many polarities—the thing made known by its opposite.\nThe thing stands out against a background which defines it, Leto thought. Surely Moneo will see this.\n“It’s too dangerous,” Moneo said.\nThe ultimate verdict of conservatism!\nMoneo was not convinced. A deep sigh wracked him.\nI must remember not to take away their doubts, Leto thought. That’s how | failed my Fish Speakers in the plaza.\nThe Ixians are holding on to the ragged end of human doubts. Hwi is the evidence of that.\nA disturbance sounded in the anteroom. Leto sealed the portal against impetuous intrusions.\n“My Duncan has come,” he said.\n“He’s probably heard about your wedding plans—”\n“Probably.”\nLeto watched Moneo wrestle with doubts, his thoughts utterly transparent. In that moment, Moneo fit so precisely into his human niche that Leto wanted to hug him.\nHe has the full spectrum: doubt-to-trust, love-to-hate.. . everything! All of those dear qualities which come to fruition in the warmth of emotion, in the willingness to soend yourself on Life.\n“Why is Hwi accepting this?” Moneo asked.\nLeto smiled. Moneo cannot doubt me; he must doubt others.\n“I admit it is not a conventional union. She is a primate and I no longer am fully primate.”\nAgain, Moneo wrestled with things he could only feel and not express.\nWatching Moneo, Leto felt the flow of an observational- awareness, a thought process which occurred so rarely but with such vivid amplification when it did occur, that Leto did not stir lest he cause a ripple in the flow.\nThe primate thinks and, by thinking, survives. Beneath his thinking is a thing which came with his cells. It is the current of human concerns for the species. Sometimes, they cover it up, wall it off and hide it behind thick barriers, but | have deliberately sensitized Moneo to these workings of his innermost self. He follows me because he believes I hold the best course for human survival. He knows there is a cellular awareness. It is what I find when I scan the Golden Path. This is humanity and both of us agree: it must endure!\n“Where, when and how will the wedding ceremony be conducted?” Moneo asked.\nNot why? Leto noted. Moneo no longer sought to understand the why. He had returned to safe ground. He was the majordomo, the director of the God Emperor’s household, the First Minister.\nHe has names and verbs and modifiers with which he can perform. The words will work for him in their usual ways. Moneo may never glimpse the transcendental potential of his words, but he well understands their everyday, mundane uses.\n“What of my question?” Moneo pressed.\nLeto blinked at him, thinking: /, on the other hand, feel that words are mostly useful if they open for me a glimpse of attractive and undiscovered places. But the use of words is so little understood by a civilization which still believes unquestioningly in a mechanical universe of absolute cause and effect—obviously reducible to one single root-cause and one primary seminal-effect.\n“How like a limpet the Ixian-Tleilaxu fallacy clings to human affairs,” Leto said.\n“Lord, it disturbs me deeply when you don’t pay attention.”\n“But | do pay attention, Moneo.”\n“Not to me.”\n“Even to you.”\n“Your attention wanders, Lord. You do not have to conceal that from me. | would betray myself before | would betray you.”\n“You think I’m woolgathering?”\n“Whatgathering, Lord?” Moneo had never questioned this word earlier, but now...\nLeto explained the allusion, thinking: How ancient! The looms and shuttles clicked in Leto’s memory. Animal fur to human garments... huntsman to herdsman... the long steps up the ladder of awareness... and now they must make another long step, longer even than the ancient ones.\n“You indulge in idle thoughts,” Moneo accused.\n“I have time for idle thoughts. That’s one of the most interesting things about my existence as a singular multitude.”\n“But, Lord, there are matters which demand our...”\n“You'd be surprised what comes of idle thinking, Moneo. I’ve never minded spending an entire day on things a human would not bother with for one minute. Why not? With my life expectancy of some four thousand years, what’s one day more or less? How much time does one human life count? A million minutes? I’ve already experienced almost that many days.”\nMoneo stood frozen in silence, diminished by this comparison. He felt his own lifetime reduced to a mote in Leto’s eye. The source of the allusion did not escape him.\nWords... words... words, Moneo thought.\n“Words are often almost useless in sentient affairs,” Leto said.\nMoneo held his breathing to a shallow minimum. The Lord can read thoughts!\n“Throughout our history,” Leto said, “the most potent use of words has been to round out some transcendental event, giving that event a place in the accepted chronicles, explaining the event in such a way that ever afterward we can use those words and say: “This is what it meant.”\nMoneo felt beaten down by these words, terrified by unspoken things they might make him think.\n“That’s how events get lost in history,” Leto said.\nAfter a long silence, Moneo ventured: “You have not answered my question, Lord. The wedding?”\nHow tired he sounds, Leto thought. How utterly defeated.\nLeto spoke briskly: “I have never needed your good offices more. The wedding must be managed with utmost care. It must have the precision of which only you are capable.”\n“Where, Lord?”\nA bit more life in his voice.\n“At Tabur Village in the Sareer.”\n“When?”\n“Į leave the date to you. Announce it when all things are arranged.”\n“And the ceremony itself?”\n“I will conduct it.”\n“Will you need assistants, Lord? Artifacts of any kind?”\n“The trappings of ritual?”\n“Any particular thing which | may not...”\n“We will not need much for our little charade.”\n“Lord! | beg of you! Please...”\n“You will stand beside the bride and give her in marriage,” Leto said. “We will use the Old Fremen ritual.”\n“We will need water rings then,” Moneo said.\n“Yes! | will use Ghani’s water rings.”\n“And who will attend, Lord?”\n“Only a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>GEO<|>The Citadel is a significant location mentioned in the text, likely a central place in the Empire where important events occur.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a concerned and loyal servant of the God Emperor, often questioning and advising Leto on matters of state and personal conduct.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a near-immortal ruler with deep emotions and philosophical insights, currently experiencing a resurgence of human feelings.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>PERSON<|>Hwi Noree is a person who has deeply affected Leto, bringing him emotional comfort and challenging his usual detachment.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPIRE<|>GEO<|>The Empire is the vast domain ruled by Leto, encompassing many planets and cultures.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>A historical event where humans destroyed thinking machines to preserve human essence and judgment.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixians are a group known for their technological prowess, paradoxically producing Hwi Noree who embodies anti-mechanical qualities.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABUR VILLAGE<|>GEO<|>Tabur Village in the Sareer is the planned location for Leto's wedding ceremony.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARER<|>GEO<|>The Sareer is a region within the Empire, home to Tabur Village.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD FREMEN RITUAL<|>EVENT<|>A traditional ceremony used for significant events like weddings, involving specific artifacts like water rings.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan is a loyal follower of Leto, likely a trusted advisor or guard.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>LETO<|>Moneo is a loyal servant and advisor to Leto, deeply concerned for his well-being and the stability of the Empire.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>HWI NOREE<|>Leto has deep emotional feelings for Hwi Noree, who brings him comfort and challenges his usual detachment.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>Leto reflects on the Butlerian Jihad as a pivotal event that shaped human history and values.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>IXIANS<|>Hwi Noree was produced by the Ixians, despite embodying qualities contrary to their technological focus.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TABUR VILLAGE<|>Leto plans to hold his wedding at Tabur Village, indicating its significance as a location.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TABUR VILLAGE<|>SARER<|>Tabur Village is located within the Sareer region.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>OLD FREMEN RITUAL<|>Leto chooses the Old Fremen Ritual for his wedding, showing his connection to traditional ceremonies.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUNCAN<|>Duncan is a loyal follower of Leto, likely involved in significant events like the wedding.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>EMPIRE<|>Leto rules the Empire, making decisions that affect its entire domain.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
