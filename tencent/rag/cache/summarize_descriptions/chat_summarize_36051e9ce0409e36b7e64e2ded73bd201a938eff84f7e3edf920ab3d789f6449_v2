Multiple sources confirm that their release occurred simultaneously as part of the same deal, with no contradictory information provided. The repeated emphasis on their shared status as hostages in the same exchange underscores that their captivity and liberation were directly linked.  \n\nIn summary, Samuel Namara and Durke Bataglani were Aurelian hostages detained in Firuzabad and subsequently freed together in a coordinated release agreement.
