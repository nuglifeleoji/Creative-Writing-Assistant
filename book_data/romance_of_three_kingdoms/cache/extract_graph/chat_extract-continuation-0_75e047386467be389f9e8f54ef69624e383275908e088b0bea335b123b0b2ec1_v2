�，既已伏诛，汝何听信人言，欲尽诛宦官耶？”何进听罢，出谓众官曰：“蹇硕设谋害我，可族灭其家。其余不必妄加残害。”袁绍曰：“若不斩草除根，必为丧身之本。”进曰：“吾意已决，汝勿多言。”众官皆退。次日，太后命何进参录尚书事，其余皆封官职。董太后宣张让等入宫商议曰：“何进之妹，始初我抬举他。今日他孩儿即皇帝位，内外臣僚，皆其心腹：威权太重，我将如何？”让奏曰：“娘娘可临朝，垂帘听政；封皇子协为王；加国舅董重大官，掌握军权；重用臣等：大事可图矣。”董太后大喜。次日设朝，董太后降旨，封皇子协为陈留王，董重为骠骑将军，张让等共预朝政。何太后见董太后专权，于宫中设一宴，请董太后赴席。酒至半酣，何太后起身捧杯再拜曰：“我等皆妇人也，参预朝政，非其所宜。昔吕后因握重权，宗族千口皆被戮。今我等宜深居九重；朝廷大事，任大臣元老自行商议，此国家之幸也。愿垂听焉。”董后大怒曰：“汝鸩死王美人，设心嫉妒。今倚汝子为君，与汝兄何进之势，辄敢乱言！吾敕骠骑断汝兄首，如反掌耳！”何后亦怒曰：“吾以好言相劝，何反怒耶？”董后曰：“汝家屠沽小辈，有何见识！”两宫互相争竞，张让等各劝归宫。何后连夜召何进入宫，告以前事。何进出，召三公共议。来早设朝，使廷臣奏董太后原系藩妃，不宜久居宫中，合仍迁于河间安置，限日下即出国门。一面遣人起送董后；一面点禁军围骠骑将军董重府宅，追索印绶。董重知事急，自刎于后堂。家人举哀，军士方散。张让、段珪见董后一枝已废，遂皆以金珠玩好结构何进弟何苗并其母舞阳君，令早晚入何太后处，善言遮蔽：因此十常侍又得近幸。\n\n
