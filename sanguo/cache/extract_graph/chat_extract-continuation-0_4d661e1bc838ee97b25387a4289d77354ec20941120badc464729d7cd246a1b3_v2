。中书今胡冲、光禄勋薛莹奏曰：“陛下何不效安乐公刘禅乎？”皓从之，亦舆榇自缚，率诸文武，诣王濬军前归降。濬释其缚，焚其榇，以王礼待之。唐人有诗叹曰：“西晋楼船下益州，金陵王气黯然收。千寻铁锁沉江底，一片降旗出石头。人世几回伤往事，山形依旧枕寒流。今逢四海为家日，故垒萧萧芦荻秋。”于是东吴四州，四十三郡，三百一十三县，户口五十二万三千，官吏三万二千，兵二十三万，男女老幼二百三十万，米谷二百八十万斛，舟船五千余艘，后官五千余人，皆归大晋。大事已定，出榜安民，尽封府库仓禀。\n\n    次日，陶濬兵不战自溃。琅琊王司马伷并王戎大兵皆至，见王濬成了大功，心中忻喜。次日，杜预亦至，大犒三军，开仓赈济吴民。于是吴民安堵。惟有建平太守吾彦，拒城不下；闻吴亡，乃降。王濬上表报捷。朝廷闻吴已平，君臣皆贺，上寿。晋主执杯流涕曰：“此羊太傅之功也，惜其不亲见之耳！”骠骑将军孙秀退朝，向南而哭曰：“昔讨逆壮年，以一校尉创立基业；今孙皓举江南而弃之！悠悠苍天，此何人哉！”\n\n    却说王濬班师，迁吴主皓赴洛阳面君。皓登殿稽首以见晋帝。帝赐坐曰：“朕设此座以待卿久矣。”皓对曰：“臣于南方，亦设此座以待陛下。”帝大笑。贾充问皓曰：“闻君在南方，每凿人眼目，剥人面皮，此何等刑耶？”皓曰：“人臣弑君及奸回不忠者，则加此刑耳。”充默然甚愧。帝封皓为归命侯，子孙封中郎，随降宰辅皆封列侯。丞相张悌阵亡，封其子孙。封王濬为辅国大将军。其余各加封赏。\n\n    自此三国归于晋帝司马炎，为一统之基矣。此所谓“天下大势，合久必分，分久必合”者也。后来后汉皇帝刘禅亡于晋泰始七年，魏主曹奂亡于太安元年，吴主孙皓亡于太康四年，皆善终。后人有古风一篇，以叙其事曰：\n\n    高祖提剑入咸阳，炎炎红日升扶桑；光武龙兴成大统，金乌飞上天中央；哀哉献帝绍海宇，红轮西坠咸池傍！何进无谋中贵乱，凉州董卓居朝堂；王允定计诛逆党，李傕郭汜兴刀枪；四方盗贼如蚁聚，六合奸雄皆鹰扬；孙坚孙策起江左，袁\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
