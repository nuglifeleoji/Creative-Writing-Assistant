\n　　他把它放在一个棉垫子上，然后悄悄溜到厨房里，把几片止疼片拿刀背捣碎，在杯子里拿水调成汤，又带了几块熟肉回来。他把肉放在猫嘴边，猫只是呻吟般喵呜着，无心食用。他就拿小勺子给它喂药。尽管他给猫说，这是止痛药，但猫怎么也不喝。 \n　　他只好把杯子放在一边，束手无策地坐在猫旁边，陪伴着它。外面的风似乎小了，寂静中听见一片沙沙声。隔壁房间里，传来福军沉重的鼾声。 \n　　徐国强呆呆地看着奄奄一息的老黑猫。此刻，这只猫对他来说，已经不是动物，而是他的亲人。他记得爱云她妈临终的时候，他也就这样呆在她的床边。动物和人一样，总有一天也要走向生命的终点。在这个时刻，他们是极需要亲人守护在身边的；这样，他们也许能镇定地度过这最后的时光。 \n　　亲爱的黑猫渐渐连呻吟的力气也没有了。受伤的眼皮耷拉下来，遮住了那两只美丽、金黄色的眼睛。 \n　　老汉轻轻把它抱在怀里，用一只青筋突暴的手悲痛的抚摸着它。 \n　　黎明时分，老黑猫在徐国强的怀抱里死去了。 \n　　老汉用手掌抹去满脸泪水，抱起这个咽气的伙伴，打开了通往阳台的门。他看见，外面已经铺了一层寸把厚的雪。天阴得很重，空中仍然飘飞着雪花。风已经完全停了，空气中流荡着一种微微的温暖。 \n　　他把老黑猫安放在阳台的一个角落里，用那片棉垫遮盖住它，然后静静地立在栏杆边，望着风雪迷朦的城市和模模糊糊的远山，嘴里叹息着，胡楂子周围结上了一圈白霜……徐国强老汉一个上午没有出自己的房门。他盘腿坐在床铺上，沉默地抽了很长一阵烟。后来，他在床下找出一个小小的木匣子，用笤帚打扫干净，给里面垫了一些新棉絮。他要象安葬人一样安葬他的老黑猫。 \n　　中午前后，他的猫入“殓”了。他把那只猫经常饮水吃食的小碗和那个毛线蛋，都放在了“棺材”里；然后拿小木片把木匣子钉起来。 \n　　福军和爱云中午都不回家来，他自己也无心吃饭；于是就把这个小木匣装进一个破提包，又拿了一把挖炉灰的小铁铲，一个人静悄悄地出了门。 \n　　他踏着厚茸�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
