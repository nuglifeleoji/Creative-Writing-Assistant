They’re all in useful categories.”\n“No more?” The Duke pursed his lips, then: “Well, pass the word along to—”\nA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke’s ear.\nLeto waved him back, said: “Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff.”\nPaul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho’s dark round face\nturned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\nIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: “We've taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier—badly wounded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I’d seen how badly off the man was and Stopped to do what | could. | surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.” Idaho glanced down at Leto. “A knife, m’Lord, a knife the like of which you’ve never seen.”\n“Crysknife?” someone asked.\n“No doubt of it,” Idaho said. “Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.” He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.\n“Keep that blade in its sheath!”\nThe voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.\nA tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue—no white in them at all.\n“Let him enter,” Idaho whispered.\n“Pass that man,” the Duke said.\nThe guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.\nThe man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.\n“This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch | visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,” Idaho said.\n“Welcome, sir,” Leto said. “And why shouldn’t we unsheath this blade?”\nStilgar glanced at Idaho, said: “You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. | would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.” His gaze swept the others in the room. “But | do not know these others. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?”\n“I am the Duke Leto,” the Duke said. “Would you permit me to see this blade?”\n“PIL permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,” Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand. “I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.”\nIn the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader—a Fremen leader.\nA man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: “Who’s he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?”\n“It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed,” the Fremen said. “Thus | must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.” He passed a dark glance across Idaho.\n“They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.”\nHalleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: “The Duke Leto determines whether—”\n“One moment, please,” Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: “Sir, | honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity. | am indeed indebted to you. And | a/ways pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered—by me. And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.”\nThe Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.\nAs the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho’s voice boomed across the room: “Hold!”\nInto the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: “We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body’s moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.” And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.\nAside to the Duke, he said: “Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.”\nLeto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul’s eye, a rueful grin on his son’s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.\nThe Fremen looked at Idaho, said: “You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?”\n“He’s asking me to enlist with him, Sire,” Idaho said.\n“Would he accept a dual allegiance?” Leto asked.\n“You wish me to go with him, Sire?”\n“I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,” Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.\nIdaho studied the Fremen. “Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar? There’d be times when I'd have to return to serve my Duke.”\n“You fight well and you did your best for our friend,” Stilgar said. He looked at Leto. “Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.”\n“Duncan?” Leto asked.\n“I understand, Sire,” Idaho said.\n“It is agreed, then,” Leto said.\n“Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho,” Stilgar said. “The body of our friend remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us.”\nLeto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat’s eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.\n“I will await below,” Stilgar said, “while Idaho makes farewell with his friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.”\nStilgar started to turn away.\n“Will you not stay a while?” Leto asked.\nThe Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place.\n“Is there reason to stay?” the Fremen asked.\n“We would honor you,” the Duke said.\n“Honor requires that | be elsewhere soon,” the Fremen said. He shot another glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.\n“If the other Fremen match him, we'll serve each other well,” Leto said.\nIdaho spoke in a dry voice: “He’s a fair sample, Sire.”\n“You understand what you’re to do, Duncan?”\n“I’m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.”\n“Much depends on you, Duncan. We're going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.”\n“This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch.” Idaho hesitated, then: “And, Sire, there’s one other thing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary says there’s a Harkonnen reward of a million solaris for anyone who'll bring in a single crysknife.”\nLeto’s chin came up in a movement of obvious Surprise. “Why do they want one of those blades so badly?”\n“The knife is ground from a sandworm’s tooth; it’s the mark of the Fremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They’d question me unless | were known. | don’t look Fremen. But....”\n“Piter de Vries,” the Duke said.\n“A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,” Hawat said.\nIdaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.\n“Guard that knife,” the Duke said.\n“I understand, m’Lord.” He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. “l'Il report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language.” He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.\nThey heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.\nA look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.\n“We've much to do, Sire,” Halleck said.\n“And | keep you from your work,” Leto said.\n“| have the report on the advance bases,” Hawat said. “Shall I give it another time, Sire?”\n“Will it take long?”\n“Not for a briefing. It’s said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.”\n“Equipment in them?” the Duke asked.\n“According to the reports | have from Duncan.”\n“Where are they located?” Halleck asked.\n“The answer to that question,” Hawat said, “is invariably: ‘Liet knows.’”\n“God knows,” Leto muttered.\n“Perhaps not, Sire,” Hawat said. “You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?”\n“Serving two masters,” Halleck said. “It sounds like a religious quotation.”\n“And you should know,” the Duke said. Halleck smiled.\n“This Judge of the Change,” Leto said, “the Imperial ecologist—Kynes.... Wouldn’t he know where those bases are?”\n“Sire,” Hawat cautioned, “this Kynes is an Imperial servant.”\n“And he’s a long way from the Emperor,” Leto said. “I want those bases. They’d be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment.”\n“Sire!” Hawat said. “Those bases are still legally His Majesty’s fief.”\n“The weather here’s savage enough to destroy anything,” the Duke said. “We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases exist.”\n“\"Twere dangerous to commandeer them,” Hawat said. “Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the\nFremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.”\nPaul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father’s attitude.\n“Listen to him, Father,” Paul said in a low\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2ef04b1084487b8197290ec43d4e0c8bb1b5330de0b6d1d6a3336d22a75e9610_v2"}
