\n　　自去年秋天以来，孙少安从没感到生活如此顺心如意。妹妹考上了大学，弟弟当了工人，他自己的砖场也走上了正路。孙家的历史什么时候有过这样的辉煌？据神汉刘玉升传播说，他们之所以兴旺，是因为他们家老窑的风水好。这是纯粹的胡扯。前几年他们不就住在那窑里吗？可光景日月象个破筛子。这和风水屁不相干，也不是他们个人有多大能耐；如果世事不变化，他孙少安还是当年的孙少安！ \n　　这不是说，世事变了，所有的人日子都好过了。象罐子村姐姐家，光景日月一如既往。新时代也使他姐夫这样的人更有条件不务正业了。王满银一年四季跑得连个踪影也找不见，全靠姐姐一个人拉扯两个孩子。只要想起他们的不幸，他和他父亲的心头就罩上了一片乌云。另外，村里一些有困难的人乞求似地找到他门上，要来他的砖场赚点买化肥的钱，这也使他的心情感到沉重。 \n　　双水村所有人家的情况，少安心里都很清楚。他知道，大部分人家虽然不愁吃饭，但另外的发愁事并不比往年少。如今这世事，手头没两个钱，那就什么也弄不成。旁的不说，化肥买不回来，庄稼就种不进去。村里人多口众的几家人，光景实际上还不如集体时那阵儿。那时，基本按人口分粮，粮钱可以赖着拖欠。可现在，你给谁去耍赖？因此，如今在许多人吃得肚满肠肥时，个把人竟连饭也吃不上了。事实上，农村贫富两极正在迅速拉开距离。这是无法避免的，因为政策允许一部分人先富起来。这也是中国未来长远面临的最大问题，政治家们将要为此而受到严峻的考验。这当然是后话了。 \n　　眼下贫困的人怎么办？办法不很多。吃救济款吗？现在石圪节乡一年的救济款才三百元，人均只有几分钱！ \n　　当贫困的人们带着绝望的神情来找少安的时候，他常常十分痛苦。他也穷过啊！当年，他不就是这样绝望过吗？他现在完全理解这些乡邻们的处境。他同情他们。尤其是一队人，他曾经和这些人一块劳动和生活了二十多年！现在，他眼睁睁地看着他们手无分文，而他又帮不了多少忙。 \n　　从内心说，不管他自己将如何发达起来，他永远不会是那种看不见别人死活的人。他那辛酸的生活史使他时刻保持着对普通人痛苦的敏感和入微的体会。 \n　　这一天，田四和田五找上门来了。田四是他当队长时一队的老饲养员。多少年里，万江老汉就睡在饲养室，象对自己的娃娃一样精心喂养那些\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
