父亲写信让他“马上返回”——出了什么紧急事呢？如果是好事，他会在信上写明的，看来家里一定有什么不幸了，父亲怕他着急，才用了这么含糊的口气给他写信。 \n　　但是，他的心脏也开始健强了一些，心想，就是天塌下来，也按塌下来处理，熬煎也没有用！ \n　　汽车过了分水岭，少平的心忍不住“怦怦”地跳起来。公路两边熟悉的山山峁峁都亲切地出现在视野之内。他看见，东拉河两岸的沟道和山头。庄稼再不象往年一样大片大片都是同一种类。现在，各种作物一块块互相连接而又各自独成一家。每一块地都淋漓尽致地表现出了主人的个性。个把地块庄稼长得不好，你就知道它的主人肯定不是个勤快人。 \n　　树庄里，有的秋庄稼已经上了禾场。金黄的颗粒被赤膊的庄稼人一锨锨扬向蔚蓝的天空；碎雨似的五谷落下来，撒在嬉闹的孩子们的身上。山野的小路上，农妇们颤动着肥大的乳房，挑着送饭罐悠悠闲闲地走着。沟道里牛、羊、驴、马，成群结队的很少；往往三三两两，被一些大孩子放牧着——少平知道，这些孩子都是刚刚退学的。各个村庄里，看来没有什么人闲呆着。新的生活和劳动是平静的，但少平又很清楚，对于每个家庭来说，那一天中的节奏充满了忙乱和紧张…… \n　　亲爱的双水村就在眼前了。少平透过车窗，远远地望见他家的窑顶上飘曳着一柱灰白的柴烟；一股说不出的温暖和甜蜜刹那间涌上他的心头，使他忍不住鼻子一酸，几乎要哭了。 \n　　哦，家乡，永远叫人依恋和动情的家乡呀！ \n                  第20章\n　　孙少平回家以后才知道，父亲是因为分家的事才写信让他回来的。 \n　　比起他想象的其它灾祸，这件事看来并不特别严重。《红楼梦》里的风姐说，没有不散的筵席。弟兄分家，或者父子分家，在农村已经是一件很自然的事。和其他人家相比，大哥和嫂子结婚几年都和他们一块过光景，这也就不容易了。现在他们要单另立家。不论从哪方面说都无可非议。 \n　　少平看出，大哥心里很难过。少平理解他的心情。 \n　　他去烧砖窑转的时候，大哥把他引到下面的沟道里，想和他单独说说话。 \n　　弟兄俩坐在东拉河边，一时都不知该从何说起。 \n　　少平给少安抽出一根纸烟。少安说他抽不惯，仍然用纸片给自己卷了一支旱烟棒。 \n　　“大哥，分家的事，你也不要过多地想什么。爸爸的考虑是对的，你和我嫂现在应该单\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
