“不要在这里停留，请尽快离开。”一名守卫的声音通过头盔的扩音器传出电子音。\n\n    “那我要不离开你们能怎样？”皮衣男子耸了耸肩膀，一副无所谓的样子。\n\n    “不要找麻烦。否则后果自负。”另一名守卫沉声说道。\n\n    “哦。我走、我走还不行吗？”皮衣男子似乎有些泄气，高举双手，示意自己是人畜无害的。然后就转身向写字楼方向走去。\n\n    像他这种略带挑衅的人守卫见的多了，也没太在意，转身就向自己值守的方向走去。\n\n    皮衣男子这时嘴角却流露出一丝得意，右手上突然光芒一闪，多了一样东西。那是一个黑色的头盔，头盔在额头的位置有一颗银白色的晶体。\n\n    他直接将头盔套在了自己头上，然后右手就按在了那晶体之上。\n\n    “开始！”\n\n    “嗡——”一股无形的能量，以那头盔为中心骤然向外扩散开来。尤其是朝着那六名守卫的方向。\n\n    而天际大厦不远处，一辆大型魂导运输开车的后车厢顶部缓缓裂开，一个直径足有三米开外的大型电子干扰器缓缓从里面钻了出来，舒展出自己的身体。\n\n    车内，六个人围在干扰器的操作器旁，双手之中同时魂力输出，瞬间将干扰器的功率提升到了最大程度。\n\n    一股无形的干扰波暴射而出，直奔天际大厦一百一十一层的方向射去。\n\n    “隔绝完成！”\n\n    天际大厦一百层。\n\n    六名守卫的身体已经完全软倒在地。那名皮衣男子一个箭步就到了电梯旁，右手上套了一个机械手。几根纤细的蓝色机械丝从里面钻出，飞快的钻入到了通往更高层的电梯金属面板之中。\n\n    “开始入侵。”\n\n    “与中央银行断开链接。你有十五分钟的时间。十五分钟内撤退。”\n\n    皮衣男子哈哈一笑，“用不了那么久，十分钟以内完成。”\n------------\n\n第五十章 圈套\n\n    “叮！”电梯门开启，皮衣男子一闪身就钻了进去，按下了一百一十一层的按钮。\n\n    电梯关门，飞速上行。一共只有十一层，几乎是须臾之间就已抵达。\n\n
