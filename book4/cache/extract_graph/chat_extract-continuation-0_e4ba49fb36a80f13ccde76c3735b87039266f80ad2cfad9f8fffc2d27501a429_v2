\n　　“我爸没上过。我爷上过。我爸的字是我爷教的。我爷早死了……我没看过《红岩》小说，但我会唱《红岩》歌剧里的歌。我的名字就是我爸从这歌词里面取的。那歌剧里有一句歌词是：红岩上，红梅开……” \n　　她这样轻声慢语地说着，他呆呆地听着。 \n　　她突然红着脸说：“你的书还了没有？” \n　　他说：“还没。” \n　　“能不能借我看一下？” \n　　“能！”他爽快地回答。 \n　　于是，第二天他就把书交到了她的手里。 \n　　在这以后，只要孙少平看过的书，就借给郝红梅看。无论是他给她借书，还是她给他还书，两个人不约而同地都是悄悄进行的。他们都知道，一个男生和一个女生这样过分亲密的交往，如果让班里的同学们发现了，会引起什么样的反响——那他们也就别想安宁地过日子了！ \n                  第3章\n　　惊蛰过后很长一段日子，尽管节令也已经又越过了春分，但连绵的黄土高原依然是冬天的面貌。山野里草木枯黑，一片荒凉。只是夜晚的时间倒明显地缩短了。 \n　　一直到了四月初，清明节的前一天，突然刮起了一场铺天盖地的大黄风。风刮得天昏地暗，甚至大白天都要在房子里点亮灯。根据往常的经验，这场黄风是天气变暖的先兆。是的，从节令来看，也应该有些春天的迹象了。 \n　　清明那一天，黄风停了。但天空仍然弥漫着尘埃，灰漠漠一片笼罩着天地。 \n　　以后紧接着的几天，气候突然转暖了。人们惊异地发现，街头和河岸边的柳树不知不觉地抽出了绿丝；桃杏树的枝头也已经缀满了粉红的花蕾。如果留心细看，那向阳山坡的枯草间，已经冒出了一些青草的嫩芽。同时，还有些别的树木的枝条也开始泛出鲜亮的活色，鼓起了青春的苞蕾，象刚开始发育的姑娘一样令人悦目。 \n　　孙少平的日子过得和往常差不多：吃黑高粱面馍；看借来的课外书；在城里的各个地方转悠。他继续把看完的书又借给郝红梅看。他们两个人现在的交往，倒比开始时自然多了，并且对对方的一些情况也有了解。 \n　　时间长了一些，班上同学之间也开始变得熟悉起来。他和乡里来的一些较贫困的学生初步建立起了某种友谊关系。由于他读书多，许多人很爱听他讲书中的故事。这一点使孙少平非常高兴，觉得自己并不是什么都低人一等。加上气候变暖，校园里已经桃红柳绿，他的心情开朗了许多。而且他的单�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
