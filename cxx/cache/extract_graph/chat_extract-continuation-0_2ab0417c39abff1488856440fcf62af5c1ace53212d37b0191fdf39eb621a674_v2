will seals off all exits。（天有绝人之路）\n　　现在在孩子们看来，这句话很可笑。\n　　在大厦中，孩子的生活全由FG来料理。到吃饭时，总有一辆三轮自动小车进入他们的房间，车上放着热腾腾的由大厦后面的厨房中做出的饭，负责伙食的孩子们为了省事，饭大多是用罐头做成的，但很好吃，而且一顿一个样。每个房间中都有一个终端机，用它可以看大厦电子资料库中的所有书籍，可以玩电子游戏，还可以在壁挂电视上选择十年内的所有电视节目。这一天对全国来说是十分平静的一天，可以说在历史上还从来没有这么平静过。刚从恐惧和紧张中恢复过来的孩子们似乎觉得今后的一切都有了着落，都睡啊睡，睡个没完。白天没有什么新消息传到大厦中来，整个世界似乎都睡着了。但到了半夜，FG收到的电话却多了起来，孩子们问的都是一个问题：\n　　“下面该怎么办呢？”\n　　FG的回答都很简单：“你们很快就会知道的。”\n　　超新星纪元第三天的早晨来到了，玫瑰星云像昨天那样落下，太阳也像昨天那样升起。7点30分，全国一亿多台电话又同时响了起来，广阔的国土笼罩在一片铃声和蜂鸣声之中。这声音使许多孩子想起了学校的早自习，他们丢下正在吃着的早饭，拿起电话，听到了FG的声音：\n　　“小朋友们注意，吃完早饭后尽快把小弟弟小妹妹们安顿好，在8点50分接通FG，在今天上午9点钟，我们将召开第一次全民大会。”\n　　8点30分，信息大厦中的小领导者们都上到\n######################\nOutput:",
