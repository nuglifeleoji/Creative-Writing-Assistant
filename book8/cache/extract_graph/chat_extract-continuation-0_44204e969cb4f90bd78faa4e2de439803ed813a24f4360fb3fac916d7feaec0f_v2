蓝轩宇隐瞒了自己魂力降级的事情，毕竟，十四级和十三级的差别也不是那么明显。至少在期中考试测试之前，他是不会被发现的。而他也开始全力以赴的修炼，只要有时间就全力冥想，尝试着努力恢复自己的魂力。\n\n    先不说提升到更高等级，起码先恢复到十四级再说吧？不然的话，期中考试一发现自己降级了，老师们会怎么想？\n\n    当天晚上，他就拉着钱磊和刘锋再次进行了召唤，把冻千秋召唤过来，一起参与了考核之后，把信给了她。\n\n    冻千秋身上果然是有储物魂导器的，带走了信。\n\n    蓝轩宇现在只能是等着娜娜老师给自己的回复了。\n\n    整整三天，三天之后。娜娜的回信终于来了。当蓝轩宇看了她的回信之后，心情总算是豁然开朗，所有阴霾一扫而空。\n\n    娜娜在信中告诉他，他这种情况很有可能是自体武魂融合技。也就是说，他的金纹蓝银草和银纹蓝银草是可以进行相互融合的。\n\n    这二者应该有同源之处，但又因为属性不同而格格不入。在他当时战斗又面对危机的情况下，这种隔阂终于被打破了。从而产生出了自体武魂融合技这种状态。\n\n    以他十几级的修为能够用出自体武魂融合技是非常不可思议的一件事。而魂力降级，很可能是在武魂融合后产生的异变。从蓝轩宇之后发现自身两种能量契合度增加，还出现了那一点彩色光芒来看，这种异变是好的。也就意味着，他两种格格不入的能量，开始因为自体武魂融合技而相互融合了。\n\n    如果未来能够融合的更好，甚至，可以让他的修为变得更强。武魂也变得更加强大。这是绝对的好事。但也很可能会因此而影响到他的修炼进度。\n\n    所以，娜娜给出的建议是，先尝试继续修炼，看看降低下去的那一级魂力是否会比正常情况下修炼的速度更快一些练回来。如果是的话，未来可以考虑再继续进行武魂融合。\n\n    娜娜同时也再次提醒蓝轩宇，他体内的金银两色能量因为彼此相互之间的倾轧，是他自身最大的隐患，而这次的武魂融合，很可能就能成为化解隐患的根本解决。如果是这样的话，那就是大好事了。所以，等他下一次再使用武魂融合之后，要再次告诉她变化。\n\n    别说，蓝轩宇坚持修炼了几天之后，果然发现，从十三级到十四级的修炼速度确实是要比之前快一些。可能是因为先前毕竟已经修炼到一遍，经脉拓宽足够，所以恢复的速度较快。\n\n    接下来的时间，蓝轩宇和两位室友\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
