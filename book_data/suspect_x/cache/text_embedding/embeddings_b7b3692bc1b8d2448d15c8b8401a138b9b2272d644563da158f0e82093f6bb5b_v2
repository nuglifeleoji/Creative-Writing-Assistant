enough that you say to me the Emperor is ina ferment about some association between Arrakis and his mysterious prison planet. Now, | rushed the\nwarning out to Rabban only because the courier had to leave on that Heighliner. You said there could be no delay. Well and good. But now | will have an explanation.”\nHe babbles too much, Hawat thought. He’s not like Leto who could tell me a thing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand. Nor like the Old Duke who could express an entire sentence in the way he accented a single word. This is a clod! Destroying him will be a service to mankind.\n“You will not leave here until I’ve had a full and complete explanation,” the Baron said.\n“You speak too casually of Salusa Secundus,” Hawat said.\n“It’s a penal colony,” the Baron said. “The worst riff-raff in the galaxy are sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to know?”\n“That conditions on the prison planet are more oppressive than anywhere else,” Hawat said. “You hear that the mortality rate among new prisoners is higher than sixty per cent. You hear that the Emperor practices every form of oppression there. You hear all this and do not ask questions?”\n“The Emperor doesn’t permit the Great Houses to inspect his prison,” the Baron growled. “But he hasn't seen into my dungeons, either.”\n“And curiosity about Salusa Secundus Is...ah....” Hawat put a bony finger to his lips. “...discouraged.”\n“So he’s not proud of some of the things he must do there!”\nHawat allowed the faintest of smiles to touch his dark lips. His eyes glinted in the glowtube light as he\nStared at the Baron. “And you’ve never wondered where the Emperor gets his Sardaukar?”\nThe Baron pursed his fat lips. This gave his features the look of a pouting baby, and his voice carried a tone of petulance as he said: “Why...he recruits...that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists from—”\n“Faaa!” Hawat snapped. “The stories you hear about the exploits of the Sardaukar, they’re not rumors, are they? Those are first-hand accounts from the limited number of survivors who’ve fought against the Sardaukar, eh?”\n“The Sardaukar are excellent fighting men, no doubt of it,” the Baron said. “But I think my own legions—”\n“A pack of holiday excursionists by comparison!” Hawat snarled. “You think | don’t know why the Emperor turned against House Atreides?”\n“This is not a realm open to your speculation,” the Baron warned.\nIs it possible that even he doesn’t know what motivated the Emperor in this? Hawat asked himself.\n“Any area is open to my speculation if it does what you’ve hired me to do,” Hawat said. “I am a Mentat. You do not withhold information or computation lines from a Mentat.”\nFor a long minute, the Baron stared at him, then: “Say what you must say, Mentat.”\n“The Padishah Emperor turned against House Atreides because the Duke’s Warmasters Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho had trained a fighting force —a small fighting force—to within a hair as good as\nthe Sardaukar. Some of them were even better. And the Duke was in a position to enlarge his force, to make it every bit as strong as the Emperor’s.”\nThe Baron weighed this disclosure, then: “What has Arrakis to do with this?”\n“It provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest survival training.”\nThe Baron shook his head. “You cannot mean the Fremen?”\n“I mean the Fremen.”\n“Hah! Then why warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left after the Sardaukar pogrom and Rabban’s oppression.”\nHawat continued to stare at him silently.\n“Not more than a handful!” the Baron repeated. “Rabban killed six thousand of them last year alone!”\nStill, Hawat stared at him.\n“And the year before it was nine thousand,” the Baron said. “And before they left, the Sardaukar must’ve accounted for at least twenty thousand.”\n“What are Rabban’s troop losses for the past two years?” Hawat asked.\nThe Baron rubbed his jowls. “Well, he has been recruiting rather heavily, to be sure. His agents make rather extravagant promises and—”\n“Shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers?” Hawat asked.\n“That would seem a little high,” the Baron said.\n“Quite the contrary,” Hawat said. “I can read between the lines of Rabban’s reports as well as you can. And you certainly must’ve understood my reports from our agents.”\n“Arrakis is a fierce planet,” the Baron said. “Storm losses can—”\n“We both know the figure for storm accretion,” Hawat said.\n“What if he has lost thirty thousand?” the Baron demanded, and blood darkened his face.\n“By your own count,” Hawat said, “he killed fifteen thousand over two years while losing twice that number. You say the Sardaukar accounted for another twenty thousand, possibly a few more. And I’ve seen the transportation manifests for their return from Arrakis. If they killed twenty thousand, they lost almost five for one. Why won't you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they mean?”\nThe Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: “This is your job, Mentat. What do they mean?”\n“| gave you Duncan Idaho’s head count on the sietch he visited,” Hawat said. “It all fits. If they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities, their population would be about five million. My best estimate is that they had at least twice that many communities. You scatter your population on such a planet.”\n“Ten million?”\nThe Baron’s jowls quivered with amazement.\n“At least.”\nThe Baron pursed his fat lips. The beady eyes stared without wavering at Hawat. /s this true Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this be and no one suspect?\n“We haven't even cut heavily into their birth-rate- growth figure,” Hawat said. “We’ve just weeded out\nsome of their less successful specimens, leaving the strong to grow stronger—just like on Salusa Secundus.”\n“Salusa Secundus!” the Baron barked. “What has this to do with the Emperor’s prison planet?”\n“A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most others,” Hawat said. “When you add the very best of military training—”\n“Nonsense! By your argument, / could recruit from among the Fremen after the way they’ve been oppressed by my nephew.”\nHawat spoke in a mild voice: “Don’t you oppress any of your troops?”\n“Well...1...but—”\n“Oppression is a relative thing,” Hawat said. “Your fighting men are much better off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant alternative to being soldiers of the Baron, heh?”\nThe Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities—had Rabban unwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon?\nPresently he said: “How could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits?”\n“I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength,” Hawat said. “I’d remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a training cadre of people who understood their background, preferably people who had preceded them from the same oppressive situation. Then I'd fill them with the mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to produce just such Superior beings as themselves. And all the while, I’d\nshow them what such superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine mansions... whatever they desired.”\nThe Baron began to nod. “The way the Sardaukar live at home.”\n“The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa Secundus is justified because it produced them—the elite. The commonest Sardaukar trooper lives a life, in many respects, as exalted as that of any member of a Great House.”\n“Such an idea!” the Baron whispered.\n“You begin to share my suspicions,” Hawat said.\n“Where did such a thing start?” the Baron asked.\n“Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa Secundus before the Emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there? Even the Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions are not encouraged.”\nThe Baron’s eyes glazed with thought. “Yes, a very carefully kept secret. They’d use every device of—”\n“Besides, what’s there to conceal?” Hawat asked. “That the Padishah Emperor has a prison planet? Everyone knows this. That he has—”\n“Count Fenring!” the Baron blurted.\nHawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. “What of Count Fenring?”\n“At my nephew’s birthday several years ago,” the Baron said. “This Imperial popinjay, Count Fenring, came as official observer and to...ah, conclude a business arrangement between the Emperor and myself.”\n“So?”\n“|,..ah, during one of our conversations, | believe | said something about making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring—”\n“What did you say exactly?” Hawat asked.\n“Exactly? That was quite a while ago and—”\n“My Lord Baron, if you wish to make the best use of my services, you must give me adequate information. Wasn't this conversation recorded?”\nThe Baron’s face darkened with anger. “You're as bad as Piter! | don’t like these—”\n“Piter is no longer with you, my Lord,” Hawat said. “As to that, whatever did happen to Piter?”\n“He became too familiar, too demanding of me,” the Baron said.\n“You assure me you don’t waste a useful man,” Hawat said. “Will you waste me by threats and quibbling? We were discussing what you said to Count Fenring.”\nSlowly, the Baron composed his features. When the time comes, he thought, l'II remember his manner with me. Yes. | will remember.\n“One moment,” the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his great hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood. “I said something like this,” the Baron said. “‘The Emperor knows a certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business.’ | was referring to our work force losses. Then | said something about considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem and | said the Emperor’s prison planet inspired me to emulate him.”\n“Witch blood!” Hawat snapped. “What did Fenring say?”\n“That’s when he began questioning me about you.”\nHawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. “So that’s why they started looking into Arrakis,” he said. “Well, the thing’s done.” He opened his eyes. “They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!”\n“But certainly my innocent suggestion that—”\n“Nothing is innocent in an Emperor’s eyes! What were your instructions to Rabban?”\n“Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.”\nHawat shook his head. “You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill off the natives, wipe them out entirely, or—”\n“Waste an entire work force?”\n“Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a cure", " said the Emperor’s prison planet inspired me to emulate him.”\n“Witch blood!” Hawat snapped. “What did Fenring say?”\n“That’s when he began questioning me about you.”\nHawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. “So that’s why they started looking into Arrakis,” he said. “Well, the thing’s done.” He opened his eyes. “They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!”\n“But certainly my innocent suggestion that—”\n“Nothing is innocent in an Emperor’s eyes! What were your instructions to Rabban?”\n“Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.”\nHawat shook his head. “You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill off the natives, wipe them out entirely, or—”\n“Waste an entire work force?”\n“Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a curettement, scrape out Giedi Prime like a hollow gourd?”\nThe Baron studied his Mentat, then: “He wouldn’t dare!”\n“Wouldn’t he?”\nThe Baron’s lips quivered. “What is your alternative?”\n“Abandon your dear nephew, Rabban.”\n“Aband....” The Baron broke off, stared at Hawat.\n“Send him no more troops, no aid of any kind. Don’t answer his messages other than to say you've heard of the terrible way he’s handled things on Arrakis and you intend to take corrective measures as\nsoon as you're able. l'Il arrange to have some of your messages intercepted by Imperial spies.”\n“But what of the spice, the revenues, the—”\n“Demand your baronial profits, but be careful how you make your demands. Require fixed sums of Rabban. We can—”\nThe Baron turned his hands palms up. “But how can | be certain that my weasel nephew isn’t—”\n“We still have our spies on Arrakis. Tell Rabban he either meets the spice quotas you set him or he'll be replaced.”\n“I know my nephew,” the Baron said. “This would only make him oppress the population even more.”\n“Of course he will!” Hawat snapped. “You don’t want that stopped now! You merely want your own hands clean. Let Rabban make your Salusa Secundus for you. There’s no need even to send him any prisoners. He has all the population required. If Rabban is driving his people to meet your spice quotas, then the Emperor need suspect no other motive. That’s reason enough for putting the planet on the rack. And you, Baron, will not show by word or action that there’s any other reason for this.”\nThe Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice. “Ah, Hawat, you are a devious one. Now, how do we move into Arrakis and make use of what Rabban prepares?”\n“That’s the simplest thing of all, Baron. If you set each year’s quota a bit higher than the one before, matters will soon reach a head there. Production will drop off. You can remove Rabban and take over yourself...to correct the mess.”\n“It fits,” the Baron said. “But | can feel myself tiring of all this. I’m preparing another to take over Arrakis for me.”\nHawat studied the fat round face across from him. Slowly the old soldier-spy began to nod his head. “Feyd-Rautha,” he said. “So that’s the reason for the oppression now. You're very devious yourself, Baron. Perhaps we can incorporate these two schemes. Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can go to Arrakis as their savior. He can win the populace. Yes.”\nThe Baron smiled. And behind his smile, he asked himself: Now, how does this fit in with Hawat’s personal scheming?\nAnd Hawat, seeing that he was dismissed, arose and left the red-walled room. As he walked, he could not put down the disturbing unknowns that cropped into every computation about Arrakis. This new religious leader that Gurney Halleck hinted at from his hiding place among the smugglers, this Muad’Dib.\nPerhaps | should not have told the Baron to let this religion flourish where it will, even among the folk of pan and graben, he told himself. But it’s well known that repression makes a religion flourish.\nAnd he thought about Halleck’s reports on Fremen battle tactics. The tactics smacked of Halleck himself...and Idaho...and even of Hawat.\nDid Idaho survive? he asked himself.\nBut this was a futile question. He did not yet ask himself if it was possible that Paul had survived. He knew the Baron was convinced that all Atreides were dead. The Bene Gesserit witch had been his weapon,\nthe Baron admitted. And that could only mean an end to all—even to the woman’s own son.\nWhat a poisonous hate she must’ve had for the Atreides, he thought. Something like the hate | hold for this Baron. Will my blow be as final and complete as hers?\nThere is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace— those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nD aul-Muad’Dib remembered that there had been a meal heavy with spice essence. He clung to this memory because it was an anchor point and he could tell himself from this vantage that his immediate experience must be a dream.\nlam a theater of processes, he told himself. / am a prey to the imperfect vision, to the race consciousness and its terrible purpose.\nYet, he could not escape the fear that he had somehow overrun himself, lost his position in time, so that past and future and present mingled without distinction. It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was in itself a thing intrinsically of the past.\nChani prepared the meal for me, he told himself.\nYet Chani was deep in the south—in the cold country where the sun was hot—secreted in one of the new sietch strongholds, safe with their son, Leto lI.\nOr, was that a thing yet to happen?\nNo, he reassured himself, for Alia-the-Strange- One, his sister, had gone there with his mother and with Chani—a twenty-thumper trip into the south, riding a Reverend Mother’s palanquin fixed to the back of a wild maker.\nHe shied away from the thought of riding the giant worms, asking himself: Or is Alia yet to be born?\n| was on razzia, Paul recalled. We went raiding to recover the water of our dead in Arrakeen. And | found the remains of my father in the funeral pyre. | enshrined the skull of my father in a Fremen rock mound overlooking Harg Pass.\nOr was that a thing yet to be?\nMy wounds are real, Paul told himself. My scars are real. The shrine of my father’s skull is real.\nStill in the dreamlike state, Paul remembered that Harah, Jamis’ wife, had intruded on him once to say there’d been a fight in the sietch corridor. That had been the interim sietch before the women and children had been sent into the deep south. Harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner chamber, the black wings of her hair tied back by water rings on a chain. She had held aside the chamber’s hangings and told him that Chani had just killed someone.\nThis happened, Paul told himself. This was real, not born out of its time and subject to change.\nPaul remembered he had rushed out to find Chani Standing beneath the yellow globes of the corridor, clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe with hood thrown back, a flush of exertion on her elfin features. She had been sheathing her crysknife. A huddled group had been hurrying away down the corridor with a burden.\nAnd Paul remembered telling himself: You always know when they’re carrying a body.\nChani’s water rings, worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck, tinkled as she turned toward him.\n“Chani, what is this?” he asked.\n“I dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat, Usul.”\n“You killed him?”\n“Yes. But perhaps | should’ve left him for Harah.”\n(And Paul recalled how the faces of the people around them had showed appreciation for these words. Even Harah had laughed.)\n“But he came to challenge me!”\n“You trained me yourself in the weirding way, Usul.”\n“Certainly! But you shouldn’t—”\n“I was born in the desert, Usul. I know how to use a crysknife.”\nHe suppressed his anger, tried to talk reasonably. “This may all be true, Chani, but—”\n“Lam no longer a child hunting scorpions in the sietch by the light of a handglobe, Usul. | do not play\ngames.”\nPaul glared at her, caught by the odd ferocity beneath her casual attitude.\n“He was not worthy, Usul,” Chani said. “I’d not disturb your meditations with the likes of him.” She moved closer, looking at him out of the corners of her eyes, dropping her voice so that only he might hear. “And, beloved, when it’s learned that a challenger may face me and be brought to shameful death by Muad’Dib’s woman, there’ll be fewer challengers.”\nYes, Paul told himself, that had certainly happened. It was true-past. And the number of Challengers testing the new blade of Muad’Dib did drop dramatically.\nSomewhere, in a world not-of-the-dream, there was a hint of motion, the cry of a nightbird.\n| dream, Paul reassured himself. /t’s the spice meal.\nStill, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered if it might be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world where the Fremen believed he had his true existence—into the alam al-mithal, the world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations were removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In the landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say: “I am | because I am here.”\nHis mother had said once: “The people are divided, some of them, in how they think of you.”\nI must be waking from the dream, Paul told himself. For this had happened—these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of the Fremen, these words had passed through reality.\nJessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the Fremen, Paul knew. She didn’t like the fact that people of both sietch and graben referred to Muad’Dib as Him. And she went questioning among the tribes, sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.\nShe had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: “When religion and politics travel", " knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference.

And she went questioning among the tribes, sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.\nShe had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: “When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong—faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it’s too late.”\nPaul recalled that he had sat there in his mother’s quarters, in the inner chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns out of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her out, noting the way she was always observing—even when her eyes were lowered. Her oval face had new lines in it at the corners of the mouth, but the hair was still like polished bronze. The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their overcasting of spice-imbued blue.\n“The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,” he Said.\n“Nothing about religion is simple,” she warned.\nBut Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: “Religion unifies our forces. It’s our mystique.”\n“You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,” she charged. “You never cease indoctrinating.”\n“Thus you yourself taught me,” he said.\nBut she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been the day of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had understood some of the reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his liaison—the “marriage of youth”—with Chani. But Chani had produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had found herself unable to reject the child with the mother.\nJessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: “You think me an unnatural mother.”\n“Of course not.”\n“| see the way you watch me when I’m with your sister. You don’t understand about your sister.”\n“I know why Alia is different,” he said. “She was unborn, part of you, when you changed the Water of Life. She—”\n“You know nothing of it!”\nAnd Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time, said only: “I don’t think you unnatural.”\nShe saw his distress, said: “There is a thing, Son.”\n“Yes?”\n“I do love your Chani. | accept her.”\nThis was real, Paul told himself. This wasn’t the imperfect vision to be changed by the twistings out of\ntime’s own birth.\nThe reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality began to dip through the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly that he was in a hiereg, a desert camp. Chani had planted their stilltent on flour sand for its softness. That could only mean Chani was nearby—Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.\nNow, he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep.\n“O my soul,\nHave no taste for Paradise this night, And | swear by Shai-hulud\nYou will go there,\nObedient to my love.”\nAnd she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm like the drag of the dunes against the feet:\n“Tell me of thine eyes\nAnd | will tell thee of thy heart. Tell me of thy feet\nAnd | will tell thee of thy hands. Tell me of thy sleeping\nAnd | will tell thee of thy waking. Tell me of thy desires\nAnd | will tell thee of thy need.”\nHe had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent. And he’d thought then of Gurney Halleck. Reminded by the familiar instrument, he had\nthought of Gurney whose face he had seen ina smuggler band, but who had not seen him, could not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the Harkonnens to the son of the Duke they had killed.\nBut the style of the player in the night, the distinctiveness of the fingers on the baliset’s strings, brought the real musician back to Paul’s memory. It had been Chatt the Leaper, captain of the Fedaykin, leader of the death commandos who guarded Muad’Dib.\nWe are in the desert, Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond the Harkonnen patrols. | am here to walk the sand, to lure a maker and mount him by my own cunning that | may be a Fremen entire.\nHe felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the silence surrounding him.\nIt was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the day creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.\n“You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see and know you have no fear,” Stilgar had said. “Thus we turn our time around and set ourselves to sleep this night.”\nQuietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a Slacked stillsuit around his body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So softly he moved, yet Chani heard him.\nShe spoke from the tent’s gloom, another shadow there: “It’s not yet full light, beloved.”\n“Sihaya,” he said, speaking with half a laugh in his voice.\n“You call me your desert spring,” she said, “but this day I’m thy goad. | am the Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed.”\nHe began tightening his stillsuit. “You told me once the words of the Kitab al-lbar,” he said. “You told me: ‘Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and till it.’”\n“lam the mother of thy firstborn,” she agreed.\nHe saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement, securing her stillsuit for the open desert. “You should get all the rest you can,” she said.\nHe recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: “The Sayyadina of the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate.”\nShe slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. “Today, | am both the watcher and the woman.”\n“You should’ve left this duty to another,” he said.\n“Waiting is bad enough at best,” she said. “ld sooner be at thy side.”\nHe kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned and cracked the seal of the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill not-quite- dryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn. With it came the smell of a pre-spice mass, the mass they had detected off to the northeast, and that told them there would be a maker nearby.\nPaul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and stretched the sleep from his muscles. A faint green-pearl luminescence etched the eastern horizon. The tents of his troop were small\nfalse dunes around him in the gloom. He saw movement off to the left—the guard, and knew they had seen him.\nThey knew the peril he faced this day. Each Fremen had faced it. They gave him this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself.\nIt must be done today, he told himself.\nHe thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom—the old men who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle, the old men who listened to him now in council and followed his plans, the men who returned to pay him that highest Fremen compliment: “Your plan worked, Muad’Dib.”\nYet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing that he had never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them.\nHe had not ridden the maker.\nOh, he’d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had not made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the abilities of others. No true Fremen could permit this. Until he did this thing himself, even the great southlands—the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg—were denied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one of the sick and wounded.\nMemory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the night. He saw a strange\nparallel here—if he mastered the maker, his rule was strengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this carried its own measure of command. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great Unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled.\nThe differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him—accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it in situ. Yet, when it was born, when it came into the pressures of reality, the now had its own life and grew with its own subtle differences. Terrible purpose remained. Race consciousness remained. And over all loomed the jihad, bloody and wild.\nChani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him from the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.\n“Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul,” she said.\nHe saw that she was trying to distract him, ease his mind of tensions before the deadly test. It was growing lighter, and he noted that some of his Fedaykin were already striking their tents.\n“I'd rather you told me about the sietch and about our son,” he said. “Does our Leto yet hold my mother in his palm?”\n“It’s Alia he holds as well,” she said. “And he grows rapidly. He’ll be a big man.”\n“What’s it like in the south?” he asked.\n“When you ride the maker you'll see for yourself,” she said.\n“But | wish to see it first through your eyes.”\n“It’s powerfully lonely,” she said.\nHe touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her stillsuit cap. “Why will you not talk about the sietch?”\n“I have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It’s a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are children to train that the tribe’s strength may never be lost.”\n“Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?” he asked.\n“The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food. Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on.”\n“My sister, Alla—is she accepted yet by the people?”\nChani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight.
