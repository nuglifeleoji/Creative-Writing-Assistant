蓝轩宇想了想道：“既然我们全班都在这迷宫之中。也就是说，我们之后遇到谁都有可能。而且，也很可能会面对多次战斗。想要获得最后的冠军，我觉得只是凭实力硬拼是不行的，毕竟大家的魂力有限，魂技都用不了几次。我觉得，我们是不是先找地方躲藏、躲藏，少经历一场战斗，自然就获胜的几率大一点，养精蓄锐。”\n\n    “轰、轰、轰、轰！”正在蓝轩宇说话的工夫，突然，前方传来一声声低沉的轰鸣。\n\n    此时，他们所在的地方是一条甬道，甬道高约五米，两侧和顶部地面都是石头修葺而成，两侧墙壁上有一盏盏壁灯。轰鸣是从甬道一端有些漆黑的方向传来的。\n\n    三人定睛朝着那方向看去，顿时看到，一具高约两米的石像正朝着他们这边缓缓走过来。\n\n    石像的双眼散发着红色光芒，手中持有一柄巨斧，在这宽不过五米的甬道之中，毫无疑问，它这巨斧抡起来必然能够将整个甬道封死。\n\n    “哇，看上去有点厉害的啊！轩宇，我要不要召唤？”钱磊赶忙道。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“先别，你是咱们的秘密武器呢。别召唤呢。我们养精蓄锐的话……，首先就不能让人发现。我有办法了。咱们等那石像近一点，刘锋，咱俩出手，钱磊，你到后面贴着石壁。”\n\n    他们此时所在的位置避无可避，因为身后是死胡同，没有任何可以逃走的出口。但也正因如此，蓝轩宇心中反而有了一个大胆的想法。\n\n    前方的石像速度不快，但却非常稳定的朝着他们这个方向靠近过来。机械化的声音，给人一种越来越强的压迫感。\n\n    钱磊退到最后面，蓝轩宇和刘锋在他身前五六米外站定。\n\n    蓝轩宇向刘锋道：“疯子，你去试试它的攻击方式，不用攻击它，就让它把攻击方式展现出来就行。既然这迷宫之中主要是让我们大家相互战斗，应该不会太强，更多的只是骚扰和封堵我们。”\n\n
