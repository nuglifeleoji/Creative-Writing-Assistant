As a Mentat Bashar, Teg follows Taraza’s orders meticulously, executing her plans with loyalty and precision, particularly in matters concerning the Bene Gesserit. Their partnership is highlighted by their involvement in a crucial mission involving the Duncan Idaho ghola, where Taraza recruits Teg to play a key role. Teg later references Taraza’s predictions about Duncan’s independence, indicating their shared responsibility in shaping the ghola’s training and development.  \n\nTaraza demonstrates her trust in Teg by warning him about the Honored Matres, a dangerous faction threatening the Bene Gesserit. However, their collaboration is cut short when Teg informs Lucilla that Taraza has been killed by the Honored Matres, marking a significant loss for both Teg and the Bene Gesserit. Despite her death, Teg continues to act in accordance with Taraza’s strategic foresight, underscoring the enduring influence of their partnership.  \n\nIn summary, Taraza and Teg share a relationship defined by hierarchy, mutual respect, and strategic coordination. Taraza relies on Teg’s skills as a Mentat Bashar, while Teg remains fiercely loyal to her directives, even after her demise.
