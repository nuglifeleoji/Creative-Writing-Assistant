淮。淮一面申报洛阳，一面遣副将陈泰引兵五万，来与蜀兵交战。句安、李歆各引一军出迎；因兵少不能抵敌，退入城中。泰令兵四面围住攻打，又以兵断其汉中粮道。句安、李歆城中粮缺。郭淮自引兵亦到，看了地势，忻然而喜；回到寨中，乃与陈泰计议曰：“此城山势高阜，必然水少，须出城取水；若断其上流，蜀兵皆渴死矣。”遂令军士掘土堰断上流。城中果然无水。李歆引兵出城取水，雍州兵围困甚急。歆死战不能出，只得退入城去。句安城中亦无水，乃会了李歆，引兵出城，并在一处；大战良久，又败入城去。军士枯渴。安与歆曰：“姜都督之兵，至今未到，不知何故。”歆曰：“我当舍命杀出求救。”遂引数十骑，开了城门，杀将出来。雍州兵四面围合，歆奋死冲突，方才得脱；只落得独自一人，身带重伤，余皆没于乱军之中。是夜北风大起，阴云布合，天降大雪，因此城内蜀兵分粮化雪而食。\n\n    却说李歆撞出重围，从西山小路行了两日，正迎着姜维人马。歆下马伏地告曰：“麴山二城，皆被魏兵围困，绝了水道。幸得天降大雪，因此化雪度日。甚是危急。”维曰：“吾非来迟；为聚羌兵未到，因此误了。”遂令人送李歆入川养病。维问夏侯霸曰：“羌兵未到，魏兵围困麴山甚急，将军有何高见？”霸曰：“若等羌兵到，麴山二城皆陷矣。吾料雍州兵，必尽来麴山攻打，雍州城定然空虚。将军可引兵径往牛头山，抄在雍州之后：郭淮、陈泰必回救雍州，则麴山之围自解矣。”维大喜曰：“此计最善！”于是姜维引兵望牛头山而去。\n\n    却说陈泰见李歆杀出城去了，乃谓郭淮曰：“李歆若告急于姜维，姜维料吾大兵皆在麴山，必抄牛头山袭吾之后。将军可引一军去取洮水，断绝蜀兵粮道；吾分兵一半，径往牛头山击之。彼若知粮道已绝，必然自走矣。”郭淮从之，遂引一军暗取洮水。陈泰引一军径往牛头山来。\n\n    却说姜维兵至牛头山，忽听的前军发喊，报说魏兵截住去路。维慌忙自到军前视之。陈泰大喝曰：“汝欲袭吾雍州！吾已等候多时了！”维大怒，挺枪纵马，直取陈泰。泰挥刀而迎。战不三合，泰败走，维挥兵掩杀。雍州兵退回，占住山头。维收兵就牛头山下寨。维每日令兵搦战，不分胜\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
