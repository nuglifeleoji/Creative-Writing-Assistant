Our Muad’Dib, our Mahdi! And when he called for the Jihad, | was one of those who asked: ‘Why should | go to fight there? | have no relatives there.’ But other men went— young men, friends, companions of my childhood. When they returned, they spoke of wizardry, of the power in this Atreides savior. He fought our enemy, the Harkonnen. Liet- Kynes, who had promised us a paradise upon our planet, blessed him. It was said this Atreides came to change our world and our universe, that he was the man to make the golden flower blossom in the night.”\nFarok held up his hands, examined the palms. “Men pointed to First Moon and said: ‘His soul is there.’ Thus, he was called Muad’Dib. | did not understand all this.”\nHe lowered his hands, stared across the courtyard at his son. “I had no thoughts in my head. There were thoughts only in my heart and my belly and my loins.”\nAgain, the tempo of the background music increased.\n“Do you know why | enlisted in the Jihad?” The old eyes stared hard at Scytale. “I heard there was a thing called a sea. It is very hard to believe in a sea when you have lived\nonly here among our dunes. We have no seas. Men of Dune had never known a sea. We had our windtraps. We collected water for the great change Liet-Kynes promised us... this great change Muad'Dib is bringing with a wave of his hand. | could imagine a ganat, water flowing across the land ina canal. From this, my mind could picture a river. But a sea?”\nFarok gazed at the translucent cover of his courtyard as though trying to probe into the universe beyond. “A sea,” he said, voice low. “It was too much for my mind to picture. Yet, men | knew said they had seen this marvel. | thought they lied, but | had to know for myself. It was for this reason that | enlisted.”\nThe youth struck a loud final chord on the baliset, took up a new song with an oddly undulating rhythm.\n“Did you find your sea?” Scytale asked.\nFarok remained silent and Scytale thought the old man had not heard. The baliset music rose around them and fell like a tidal movement. Farok breathed to its rhythm.\n“There was a sunset,” Farok said presently. “One of the elder artists might have painted such a sunset. It had red in it the color of the glass in my bottle. There was gold... blue. It was on the world they call Enfeil, the one where | led my legion to victory. We came out of a mountain pass where the air was sick with water. | could scarcely breathe it. And there below me was the thing my friends had told me about: water as far as | could see and farther. We marched down to it. | waded out into it and drank. It was bitter and made me ill. But the wonder of it has never left me.”\nScytale found himself sharing the old Fremen’s awe.\n“I immersed myself in that sea,” Farok said, looking down at the water creatures worked into the tiles of his floor. “One man sank beneath that water... another man arose from it. | felt that | could remember a past which had never been. | stared around me with eyes which could accept anything ... anything at all. | saw a body in the water—one of the defenders we had slain. There was a log nearby\nSupported on that water, a piece of a great tree. | can close my eyes now and see that log. It was black on one end from a fire. And there was a piece of cloth in that water—no more than a yellow rag... torn, dirty. | looked at all these things and | understood why they had come to this place. It was for me to see them.”\nFarok turned slowly, stared into Scytale’s eyes. “The universe is unfinished, you know,” he said.\nThis one is garrulous, but deep, Scytale thought. And he said: “I can see it made a profound impression on you.”\n“You are a Tleilaxu,” Farok said. “You have seen many seas. | have seen only this one, yet | Know a thing about seas which you do not.”\nScytale found himself in the grip of an odd feeling of disquiet.\n“The Mother of Chaos was born in a sea,” Farok said. “A Qizara Tafwid stood nearby when | came dripping from that water. He had not entered the sea. He stood on the sand... it was wet sand... with some of my men who shared his fear. He watched me with eyes that knew | had learned something which was denied to him. | had become a sea creature and | frightened him. The sea healed me of the Jihad and I think he saw this.”\nScytale realized that somewhere in this recital the music had stopped. He found it disturbing that he could not place the instant when the baliset had fallen silent.\nAs though it were relevant to what he’d been recounting, Farok said: “Every gate is guarded. There’s no way into the Emperor’s fortress.”\n“That’s its weakness,” Scytale said.\nFarok stretched his neck upward, peering.\n“There’s a way in,” Scytale explained. “The fact that most men—including, we may hope, the Emperor—believe otherwise... that’s to our advantage.” He rubbed his lips, feeling the strangeness of the visage he’d chosen. The musician’s silence bothered him. Did it mean Farok’s son\nwas through transmitting? That had been the way of it, naturally: The message condensed and transmitted within the music. It had been impressed upon Scytale’s own neural system, there to be triggered at the proper moment by the distrans embedded in his adrenal cortex. If it was ended, he had become a container of unknown words. He was a vessel sloshing with data: every cell of the conspiracy here on Arrakis, every name, every contact phrase—all the vital information.\nWith this information, they could brave Arrakis, capture a sandworm, begin the culture of melange somewhere beyond Muad’Dib’s writ. They could break the monopoly as they broke Muad’Dib. They could do many things with this information.\n“We have the woman here,” Farok said. “Do you wish to see her now?”\n“I’ve seen her,” Scytale said. “I’ve studied her with care. Where is she?”\nFarok snapped his fingers.\nThe youth took up his rebec, drew the bow across it. Semuta music wailed from the strings. As though drawn by the sound, a young woman in a blue robe emerged from a doorway behind the musician. Narcotic dullness filled her eyes which were the total blue of the Ibad. She was a Fremen, addicted to the spice, and now caught by an offworld vice. Her awareness lay deep within the semuta, lost somewhere and riding the ecstasy of the music.\n“Otheym’s daughter,” Farok said. “My son gave her the narcotic in the hope of winning a woman of the People for himself despite his blindness. As you can see, his victory is empty. Semuta has taken what he hoped to gain.”\n“Her father doesn’t know?” Scytale asked.\n“She doesn’t even know,” Farok said. “My son supplies false memories with which she accounts to herself for her visits. She thinks herself in love with him. This is what her\nfamily believes. They are outraged because he is nota complete man, but they won’t interfere, of course.”\nThe music trailed away to silence.\nAt a gesture from the musician, the young woman seated herself beside him, bent close to listen as he murmured to her.\n“What will you do with her?” Farok asked.\nOnce more, Scytale studied the courtyard. “Who else is in this house?” he asked.\n“We are all here now,” Farok said. “You’ve not told me what you'll do with the woman. It is my son who wishes to know.”\nAs though about to answer, Scytale extended his right arm. From the sleeve of his robe, a glistening needle darted, embedded itself in Farok’s neck. There was no outcry, no change of posture. Farok would be dead in a minute, but he sat unmoving, frozen by the dart’s poison.\nSlowly, Scytale climbed to his feet, crossed to the blind musician. The youth was still murmuring to the young woman when the dart whipped into him.\nScytale took the young woman’s arm, urged her gently to her feet, shifted his own appearance before she looked at him. She came erect, focused on him.\n“What is it, Farok?” she asked.\n“My son is tired and must rest,” Scytale said. “Come. We'll go out the back way.”\n“We had such a nice talk,” she said. “I think I’ve convinced him to get Tleilaxu eyes. It'd make a man of him again.”\n“Haven't I said it many times?” Scytale asked, urging her into a rear chamber.\nHis voice, he noted with pride, matched his features precisely. It unmistakably was the voice of the old Fremen, who certainly was dead by this time.\nScytale sighed. It had been done with sympathy, he told himself, and the victims certainly had known their peril.\nNow, the young woman would have to be given her chance.\nEmpires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual.\n—WORDS OF MUAD'DIB BY PRINCESS IRULAN\nt was going to be a bad session, this meeting of the\nImperial Council, Alia realized. She sensed contention gathering force, storing up energy—the way Irulan refused to look at Chani, Stilgar’s nervous shuffling of papers, the scowls Paul directed at Korba the Qizara.\nShe seated herself at the end of the golden council table so she could look out the balcony windows at the dusty light of the afternoon.\nKorba, interrupted by her entrance, went on with something he’d been saying to Paul. “What | mean, m’Lord, is that there aren’t as many gods as once there were.”\nAlia laughed, throwing her head back. The movement dropped the black hood of her aba robe. Her features lay exposed—blue-in-blue “spice eyes,” her mother’s oval face beneath a cap of bronze hair, small nose, mouth wide and generous.\nKorba’s cheeks went almost the color of his orange robe. He glared at Alia, an angry gnome, bald and fuming.\n“Do you know what’s being said about your brother?” he demanded.\n“I know what’s being said about your Qizarate,” Alia countered. “You’re not divines, you’re god’s spies.”\nKorba glanced at Paul for support, said: “We are sent by the writ of Muad’Dib, that He shall know the truth of His people and they shall know the truth of Him.”\n“Spies,” Alia said.\nKorba pursed his lips in injured silence.\nPaul looked at his sister, wondering why she provoked Korba. Abruptly, he saw that Alia had passed into womanhood, beautiful with the first blazing innocence of youth. He found himself surprised that he hadn’t noticed it until this moment. She was fifteen—almost sixteen, a Reverend Mother without motherhood\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>organization<|>The Atreides are a noble family, with Usul/Muad'Dib being a prominent member who led the Fremen in a Jihad against the Harkonnen>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FAROK<|>person<|>An old Fremen who participated in the Jihad led by Muad'Dib, later reflecting on his experiences and the sea on Enfeil>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>USUL/MUAD'DIB<|>person<|>Also known as Paul Atreides, the leader of the Fremen and their Mahdi, who initiated the Jihad against the Harkonnen>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNEN<|>organization<|>The enemy of the Atreides and the Fremen, opposed by Muad'Dib in the Jihad>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LIET-KYNES<|>person<|>A figure who promised the Fremen a paradise on their planet and blessed Muad'Dib>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JIHAD<|>event<|>A holy war led by Muad'Dib against the Harkonnen and other enemies of the Fremen>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENFEIL<|>geo<|>A world where Farok led his legion to victory and encountered a sea for the first time>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>geo<|>The desert planet home to the Fremen and the source of the spice melange>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>person<|>A Tleilaxu who interacts with Farok and is involved in a conspiracy against Muad'Dib>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>organization<|>A secretive and manipulative group, to which Scytale belongs, with plans to undermine Muad'Dib>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>person<|>Paul Atreides' sister, a Reverend Mother, and a key figure in the Imperial Council>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPERIAL COUNCIL<|>organization<|>A governing body where key decisions are made, attended by Alia, Paul, and others>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KORBA<|>person<|>A Qizara and member of the Imperial Council, often at odds with Alia>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>USUL/MUAD'DIB<|>ATREIDES<|>Muad'Dib is a member of the Atreides family and their leader<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>USUL/MUAD'DIB<|>JIHAD<|>Muad'Dib initiated and led the Jihad<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>USUL/MUAD'DIB<|>HARKONNEN<|>Muad'Dib fought against the Harkonnen in the Jihad<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FAROK<|>JIHAD<|>Farok participated in the Jihad led by Muad'Dib<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FAROK<|>ENFEIL<|>Farok led his legion to victory on Enfeil and encountered a sea there<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LIET-KYNES<|>ARRAKIS<|>Liet-Kynes promised the Fremen a paradise on Arrakis<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>TLEILAXU<|>Scytale is a member of the Tleilaxu and involved in their conspiracy<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>IMPERIAL COUNCIL<|>Alia is a key member of the Imperial Council<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>KORBA<|>Alia and Korba often clash in the Imperial Council<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KORBA<|>IMPERIAL COUNCIL<|>Korba is a Qizara and member of the Imperial Council<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
