A hybrid of human and sandworm, he possesses vast ancestral memories and prescient abilities, which he uses to manipulate events in service of his grand plan: ensuring the long-term survival of humanity. Despite his immense power and control over individual prosperity, he is deeply cynical, particularly toward the religion that has formed around him, which he openly despises.  \n\nLeto II's rule is marked by calculated tyranny, as he enforces his vision of humanity's future through absolute dominance. His recent marriage to **Hwi Noree** in **Tuono** underscores his complex natureâ€”capable of both cold pragmatism and personal attachments. However, his reign is not without peril; he faces a potential assassination plot, a testament to the unrest his rule generates.  \n\nAs the central figure of an empire and a religion he rejects, Leto II embodies contradiction: a god-like figure who disdains worship, a prescient manipulator who seeks to free humanity from stagnation, and a hybrid being whose very existence bridges the human and the alien.
