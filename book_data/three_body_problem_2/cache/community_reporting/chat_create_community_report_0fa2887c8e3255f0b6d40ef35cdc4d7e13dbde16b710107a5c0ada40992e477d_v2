It is a major base for the three fleets due to its abundant nuclear fusion fuel, making it an essential launch point for the United Fleet. The planet's immense size is highlighted by its mass, which is approximately six hundred times that of the combined mass of the four terrestrial planets. This colossal mass and gravitational influence mean that any changes in its orbit may take a long time to become apparent.\n\nJupiter is also noted for its role in significant events involving the Asian Fleet and the vessel known as 自然选择号 (Natural Selection), which references the planet as a destination during its journey. The planet's atmosphere is characterized by a vast ocean of gases, which is reflected in the exterior of spacecraft that traverse its vicinity. \n\nIn addition to its physical attributes, Jupiter may also symbolize broader themes or serve as a backdrop in various narratives. Its gravitational pull and potential trajectory towards the Sun add to the intrigue surrounding this giant planet, which continues to be a focal point of exploration and study within the solar system. \n\nOverall, 木星 is not only a remarkable celestial body due to its size and composition but also plays a crucial role in the dynamics of space exploration and the operations of various fleets within the solar system.\",6\r\n710,量子号,\"The \"\"量子号\"\" (Quantum) is a significant spacecraft within its fleet, notable for its survival amidst the catastrophic events caused by a water droplet. This star-class warship plays a pivotal role in deep space operations and is characterized as a larger mothership from which smaller spacecraft, such as the \"\"自然选择号\"\" (Natural Selection), launch for various missions. \n\nThe Quantum is equipped to provide a panoramic view of the surrounding cosmos, allowing its crew to observe unique celestial formations, including a series of small suns. It is also linked to the \"\"螳螂\"\" (Mantis) ship, with the exploration team having witnessed imagery related to this connection aboard the Quantum. \n\nDuring the great destruction, the Quantum successfully evaded the water droplet's attack, entering a deep-sea state that enhances its operational capabilities. This state is part of its ongoing scientific investigations, which focus on advanced technologies related to deep-sea environments. \n\nIn the fleet's formation, the Quantum occupies a strategic position at one corner of a rectangular arrangement, tasked with approaching the Trisolaran detector. Its resilience and multifunctional design make it an essential asset for the fleet, ensuring continued exploration and defense in the vastness of space.\",11\r\n705,联合舰队,\"The United Fleet, known in Chinese as 联合舰队, is a formidable coalition of spacecraft that has launched from a base on Jupiter, symbolizing humanity's military strength and unity in the face of existential threats from the Trisolaran world.
