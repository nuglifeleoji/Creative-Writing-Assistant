Specifically, he paid the Guild a substantial sum to transport Sardaukar, a highly trained and elite fighting force, as part of his attack force. Both descriptions align in confirming that the Baron sought the Guild's assistance for this strategic military operation, emphasizing the critical role the Guild played in enabling his plans on Arrakis. The term \"attack force\" in the second description is clarified by the first, which identifies the Sardaukar as the key component of this force.
