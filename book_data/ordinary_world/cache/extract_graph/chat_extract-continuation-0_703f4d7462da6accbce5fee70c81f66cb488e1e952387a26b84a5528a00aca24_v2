，别的庄稼人都已经卸了牛具，开始回家吃饭了。在他上面耕麦地的孙玉厚也扛起犁，吆着牛起身回家。孙玉厚下山时要从他这块地里经过，将要亲眼目睹他田福堂的狼狈相了！ \n　　田福堂挣扎着端直粪斗子，把刚才剩下的半犁沟播完。然后他放下粪斗，回转牛，继续向另一头犁去。他想避开过路的孙玉厚，以免让他看他的笑话！ \n　　快犁到地头的时候，田福堂听见自己的喘息声比牛的喘息声都厉害。 \n　　当他强撑着又把牛回转的时候，惊讶地看见孙玉厚端着他的粪斗子，顺着他刚耕过的犁沟，一步一把撒着粪籽，走过来了。 \n　　一团热乎乎的东西一下子堵在了田福堂的嗓子眼上。他没有想到孙玉厚会来给他帮忙，一时竟愣住了。孙玉厚走到他地头，说：“丢下这一点了，占不着再来一回……一个人种庄稼难啊……” \n　　田福堂真不知说什么是好。他结果什么也没说，只长叹了一口气，然后吆着牛向前犁去。 \n　　两个人不到几锅烟功夫，就把这点地种完了。田福堂心里泛上各种味道，咧开嘴难为情地对孙玉厚笑了笑，说：“玉厚哥，你快回去吃饭！” \n　　孙玉厚吆着牛走了以后，田福堂压制着咳嗽，一边用柴草擦犁，一边怔怔地看着下了山的孙玉厚，不禁无限感慨地想了许多事。他记起了他们年轻的时候一同给有钱人家揽工的情景，那时他们曾经象兄弟一样，伙吃一罐子饭，伙盖一床烂棉絮……解放以后多少年，尽管他们同住一村，但再也没有在一块亲热地相处过。想不到今天，他们又一块种了一会地！ \n　　在一刹那间，田福堂的心头涌上了一种怪酸楚的滋味——他已经很长时间没有体验过这样的滋味了…… \n                  第16章\n　　从小满前后出门到现在，孙少平已经在黄原度过近两个月的时光。 \n　　过几天就是大暑，天气开始热起来了。 \n　　两个月的时光，他就好象换了一副模样。原来的嫩皮细肉变得又黑又粗糙，浓密的黑发象毡片一样散乱地贴在额头。由于活苦重，饭量骤然间增大，身体看起来明显地壮了许多。两只手被石头和铁棍磨得生硬；右手背有点伤，贴着一块又黑又脏的胶布。目光似乎失去了往日的光亮，象不起波浪的水潭一般沉静；上唇上的那一撇髭须似乎也更明显了。从那松散的腿胯可以看出，他已经成为地道的揽工汉了，和别\n######################\nOutput:",
