送走“萝卜花”后，孙少平就兴奋地跑到东关，向他的好朋友金波报告了他被招工的喜讯。金波立刻炒了三十颗鸡蛋，买回一瓶白酒，两个人一下午喝得面红耳赤，说话时舌头在嘴里直打卷…… \n　　他从金波那里出来，正是下午四五点钟，西斜的太阳仍然火热地照耀着喧闹的城市。远远望去，城外四周的群山覆盖着厚重而葱茏的绿色，给人的心情带来一片荫凉。山明水净，岸柳婀娜；白得晃眼的云彩象一团团新棉絮，悠悠地飘浮在湛蓝如水的天空……少平晕晕乎乎挤过人群，来到东关大桥头。他在那“老地方”伫立了片刻。他用手掌悄悄揩去满脸的泪水，向这亲切的地方和仍然蹲在这里的揽工汉们，默默地告别。别了，我的忧伤和辛酸之地，我的幸运与幸福之地，我的神圣的耶路撒冷啊！你用严酷的爱的火焰，用无情而有力的锤砧，烧炼和锻打了我的体魄和灵魂，给了我生活的力量和包容苦难而不屈服于命运的心脏！ \n　　别了，我的东关…… \n                  第54章\n　　八月下旬，孙少平已经做好了去铜城煤矿的所有准备。在此期间，本来他想回家走一趟，但又放弃了这打算——他怕他离开黄原后，又会有什么突然的变故。幸运之神降临的过分慷慨，他生怕好景在最后一刹那变为海市蜃楼——他的心已被命运折磨怯了。如果他在黄原，事情有个变化，他就可以立刻找田晓霞力挽狂澜！ \n　　家里人到现在也许还不会知道他要去铜城当煤矿工人。这也好！当他们突然接到他从煤矿寄回的信时，一定会又惊又喜！当然，他知道，父母亲在惊喜过后，就会为他的安全担心。相信哥哥会安慰老人——上次他来黄原看他，已经对他出门在外放心了。 \n　　现在，孙少平最大的心事是，他不知道妹妹兰香能否考上大学。 \n　　按她来信说，她自以为考得不错。但这是全国性的竞争！ \n　　一个山区县城的好学生，说不定连大城市的一般学生都比不过——人家是什么学习条件啊！ \n　　孙少平在内心不断祈祷幸运之神也能降临到妹妹的头上…… \n　　按往年的时间，高考很快就要发榜了。他多么希望在他离开黄原之前，能知道妹妹的消息。无论她考上考不上，他都要为她的未来作出安排——这责任天经地义落在了他身上。再说，他对妹妹的感情极其深厚，他决不能让她象姐姐一样一辈子吃那么多苦！ \n　　现在，夏令营的工作早已结束，他不会再去找活干，因此一天很闲。晓�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character preparing to work at a coal
