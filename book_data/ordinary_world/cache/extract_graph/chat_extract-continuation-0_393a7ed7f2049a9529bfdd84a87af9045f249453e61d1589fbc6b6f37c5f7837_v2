\n　　徐治功把凉鞋脱在地上，赤脚片跹蹴在椅子里抽纸烟，先没说什么。冬春大规模农田基建结束后，他就回到公社来工作了。现在碰上这件头疼事，他感到很作难。如果这是另外村子的支部书记搞的，那他徐治功会比白明川更要严厉地处理这件事的。但这事牵扯的是田福堂。因此他不能轻易对白明川的意见表示支持。他反而对白主任说：“你不是常教导我说，要对农民宽容一点吗？福堂虽说是大队书记，但也是个农民嘛！再说，双水村是咱们石圪节公社农业学大寨的先进典型，福堂的工作一贯积极，现在犯这么个错误就给处分，恐怕不合适……” \n　　白明川听徐治功这么一说，就为难地陷入到思忖之中。他虽然对这件事气愤，但觉得治功的话也有一定的道理。而平心静气想，他作为公社一把手，也有责任。他为什么没有提早注意这个问题，而把东拉河的水给沿河的每个村庄都分一点呢？福堂和双水村的人急了，才干出了这件荒唐事……白明川想了一会，说：“不给处分也可以。但这件事不能三秤二码就了结，最起码福堂要代表双水村支部做个检查，否则我们怎样给石圪节和罐子村解释？ \n　　“因为这件事已造成全公社范围的影响，田福堂的检查必须通过有线广播向公社转播，让大家都从这件事里接受教训！” \n　　徐治功同意了白明川的这个意见。治功知道，不这样也不行。再说，这办法好！福堂虽然做检查，但是代表集体检查，而这就不是他一个人的责任了！ \n　　当文书刘根民把金俊山带到公社时，两个主任都惊讶地问：“俊山你怎来了？福堂？” \n　　金俊山说：“福堂病了……闯这祸是大队领导集体决定的，不是福堂一个人的主意。我来也一样……”金俊山是个比较实在的人，他尽管和田福堂有些矛盾，但在这种事上他不会对别人落井下石……没等公社领导盘问，金俊山就把事情的前后经过都给公社领导老实交待了……金俊山在公社灶上吃过晚饭，在中央人民广播电台的各地人民广播电台联播节目完了以后，就在公社的广播室里，代表双水村大队党支部，向全公社人民检查他们村损人利己的不法行为。俊山在进公社广播室的时候心想：双水村做下成绩，都是田福堂在广播上介绍经验出风头；而这种不光彩的倒霉事，倒轮上他金俊山了…… \n                  第29章\n　　双水村的人谁也没有想到，孙少安这家伙出门一个月，竟然带着一个大眼睛的山西姑娘回来了！ \n　　全村人议论的话题自然从不久前去世的金俊斌转移到了这位新来的姑娘身上。 \n　　太叫人惊讶了！起先谁知道少安出门是去找媳\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
