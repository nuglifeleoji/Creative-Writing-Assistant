户心上也能过得去：在这众多的人里面，我虽然没有能解决瞎眼老头的实际问题，但我是唯一关怀过他，并且用行动为他做了努力的人。 \n　　出于灾些聊以自慰的理由，我觉得自己好像心里踏实了一些。但与此同时，也隐隐感到后脑勺有点不自在。我似乎觉得那个老头的眼睛并瞎，他正在后面那个角落里望着我…… \n　　我终于把一张８０２次的车票拿到手了！这张小小的硬纸片儿，此刻给我带来的喜悦是无法形容的，它意味着我今天将回到亲人们的身边。 \n　　我带着这个充实的收获，站在８０３次的队伍后面。我很愉快：我自己得到了满足并且开始为加紧人做一件崇高的事。 \n　　我当然是这个队伍的最后一名。前面站着一个高大的青年，头发乱蓬蓬的，像故意弄成那个样子的。他穿一条带条格的裤子，一双皮鞋的后跟闪着亮光，右脚在地板上有节奏地敲着锣鼓点” \n　　时髦青年！不要看他的正面，光那后背就叫我反感，其实那后背也并没什么缺陷。的确，我现在已经对当今的年轻人有一种执拗的不信任感。我觉得，他们比我们这一代人来说，的确有许多长处，比如敏锐啦，爱思考啦，等等。但论道德啦，礼貌啦，同情心啦，哼，我敢说，未见得能比得上我们这些老头子！就拿眼前这个魁梧的小伙子来说吧，说不定他连一点教养都没有。我甚至奇怪他竟然能正以八板地站在这个队伍后面排队哩。嗯，他大概是看能买上票才这样哩；要是售票员喊一声“票快完了，后面的人不要排队了”，你再看他吧，他准会如狼似虎地扑过去。 \n　　就在这时，我又发现这队伍的旁边还站着一位青年妇女。她既像是在排队，又不在队里边；眼睛斜视着窗口，像是在索什么，又像是在等待着什么，并且还装出若无其事的样子。我断定她也是一个随时准备浑水摸鱼的人。但愿我是错猜了她！她身边还站着一个四五岁的小姑娘，看来是她的孩子。由于这一男一女两个年轻人站在前面，我有点丧气了。我深知他们会在紧要的时候做出什么事来。 \n　　我怀着一种这安的心情随队伍移动。 \n　　倒霉的事终于出现了：当只留下我们三个人的时候票已经剩最后一张了。我当然没买上。虽然我感到十分遗憾，但还是心安理得，因为这次我没买上票是正常的。 \n　　但我前面的那两个年轻人却像我所预料的那样，为那张票闹起来了。 \n　　当售票员宣布只剩一张票的时候，那青年妇女丢下孩子，猛地把手抢先伸进了售票口。等那个男青年反应过来的时候，票已经到了那\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>老头<|>PERSON<|>The old man is a
