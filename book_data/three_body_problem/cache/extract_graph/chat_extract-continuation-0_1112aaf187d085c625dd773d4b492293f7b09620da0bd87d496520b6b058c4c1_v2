一点儿暖意。他看看已经完全升出地平线的太阳，从那发出银光的巨盘上，他清晰地看到了木纹状的图形，那是固态的山脉。汪淼明白了，它本身不发光，只是反射从另一个方向发出晨光的真太阳的光芒，升起来的不是太阳，而是一个巨型月亮！巨月运行得很快，以肉眼可以察觉的速度掠过长空，在这个过程中，它逐渐由满月融缺成半月，然后又变成了月牙，老人舒缓的小提琴声在寒冷的晨风中飘荡，宇宙中壮丽的景象仿佛就是那音乐的物化，汪淼陶醉于美的震慑之中。巨大月牙在展光中落下，这时它的亮度增长了很多，当它只剩两个银光四射的尖角在地平线之上时，汪淼突然将其想象成一头正在奔向太阳的宇宙巨牛的两只犄角。\n   “尊敬的哥白尼，停一停您匆忙的脚步吧，这样您欣赏一曲莫扎特，我也就有了午饭。”巨月完全落下后，老人抬起头来说：\n   “如果我没认错一一”汪淼看着那张满是皱纹的脸说，那些皱纹都很长，曲线也很柔和，像在努力造就一种和谐：“您没认错，我是爱因斯坦，一个对上帝充满信仰却被他抛弃的可怜人。”\n   “刚才那个大月亮是怎么回事？我前几次来没有见过它。”\n   “它已经凉下来了。”\n   “谁？”\n   “大月亮啊，我小时候它还热着，升到中天时能看到核心平原上的红光，现在凉下来了……你没听说过大撕裂吗？”\n   “没有，怎么回事？”\n   爱因斯坦叹息着摇摇头：“不提了，往事不堪回首，我的过去，文明的过去，宇宙的过去，都不堪回首啊！”\n   “您怎么落到这个地步？”汪淼掏掏口袋，真的掏出了一些零钱，他弯腰将钱放到帽子里。\n   “谢谢哥白尼先生，但愿上帝不抛弃您吧，不过我对此没有信心。我感觉，您和牛顿他们到东方用人列运算的那个模型，已很接近于正确了，但所差的那么一点点，对牛顿或其他的人来说是一道不可逾越的鸿沟。我一直认为，没有我，别人也会发现狭义相对论，但广义相对论却不是这样。牛顿差的那一点，就是广义相对论所描述的行星轨道的引力摄动，它引起的误差虽然但对计算结果却是致命的。在经典方程中加入引力摄动的修正，就得到了正确的数学模型。它的运算量比你们在东方完成的要大得多，但对现代计算机来说，真的不成问题。”\n   “运算结果得到天文观测的证实了吗？”\n   “要那样我会在这里吗？但从美学角度讲，我是没错的，错的是宇宙。上帝抛弃了我，接着所有的人都抛弃了我，哪里都不要我，普林斯顿撤销了我的教授职位，联合国教科文组\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
