Arrakis will become a true desolation—without spice or maker.”\nChani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy pouring from Paul’s lips.\n“He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it,” Paul said. “We can destroy the spice.”\n“What stays the Guild’s hand?” Jessica whispered. “They’re searching for me,” Paul said. “Think of that! The finest Guild navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for the\nfastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me...and unable to find me. How they tremble! They know | have their secret here!” Paul held out his cupped hand. “Without the spice they’re blind!”\nChani found her voice. “You said you see the now!”\nPaul lay back, searching the spread-out present, its limits extended into the future and into the past, holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the spice illumination began to fade.\n“Go do as | commanded,” he said. “The future’s becoming as muddled for the Guild as it is for me. The lines of vision are narrowing. Everything focuses here where the spice is...where they’ve dared not interfere before...because to interfere was to lose what they must have. But now they’re desperate. All paths lead into darkness.”\nAnd that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel poised to spin.\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad W ill you look at that thing!” Stilgar whispered.\nPaul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim, eye fixed to the collector of a Fremen telescope. The oil lens was focused on a starship lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow side still showed yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night. Beyond the ship, the city of Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun.\nIt wasn’t the lighter that excited Stilgar’s awe, Paul knew, but the construction for which the lighter was only the centerpost. A single metal hutment, many Stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle from the base of the lighter—a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves—the temporary lodging place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial Majesty, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\nFrom his position squatting at Paul’s left, Gurney Halleck said: “I count nine levels to it. Must be quite a few Sardaukar in there.”\n“Five legions,” Paul said.\n“It grows light,” Stilgar hissed. “We like it not, your exposing yourself, Muad’Dib. Let us go back into the\nrocks now.”\n“I’m perfectly safe here,” Paul said.\n“That ship mounts projectile weapons,” Gurney said.\n“They believe us protected by shields,” Paul said. “They wouldn’t waste a shot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us.”\nPaul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin, seeing the pockmarked cliffs, the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his father’s troopers. And he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things that the shades of those men should look down on this moment. The Harkonnen forts and towns across the shielded lands lay in Fremen hands or cut away from their source like stalks severed from a plant and left to wither. Only this basin and its city remained to the enemy.\n“They might try a sortie by ‘thopter,” Stilgar said. “If they see us.”\n“Let them,” Paul said. “We’ve 'thopters to burn today...and we know a storm is coming.”\nHe swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field now, to the Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company banner waving gently from its staff on the ground beneath them. And he thought of the desperation that had forced the Guild to permit these two groups to land while all the others were held in reserve. The Guild was like a man testing the sand with his toe to gauge its temperature before erecting a tent.\n“Is there anything new to see from here?” Gurney asked. “We should be getting under cover. The storm\nis coming.”\nPaul returned his attention on the giant hutment. “They've even brought their women,” he said. “And lackeys and servants. Ah-h-h, my dear Emperor, how confident you are.”\n“Men are coming up the secret way,” Stilgar said. “It may be Otheym and Korba returning.”\n“All right, Stil,” Paul said. “We'll go back.”\nBut he took one final look around through the telescope—studying the plain with its tall ships, the gleaming metal hutment, the silent city, the frigates of the Harkonnen mercenaries. Then he slid backward around a scarp of rock. His place at the telescope was taken by a Fedaykin guardsman.\nPaul emerged into a shallow depression in the Shield Wall’s surface. It was a place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep, a natural feature of the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a translucent camouflage cover. Communications equipment was clustered around a hole in the wall to the right. Fedaykin guards deployed through the depression waited for Muad’Dib’s command to attack.\nTwo men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment, spoke to the guards there.\nPaul glanced at Stilgar, nodded in the direction of the two men. “Get their report, Stil.”\nStilgar moved to obey.\nPaul crouched with his back to the rock, stretching his muscles, straightened. He saw Stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the rock, thought\nabout the long climb down that narrow man-made tunnel to the floor of the basin.\nStilgar crossed to Paul.\n“What was so important that they couldn’t send a cielago with the message?” Paul asked.\n“They’re saving their birds for the battle,” Stilgar said. He glanced at the communications equipment, back to Paul. “Even with a tight beam, it is wrong to use those things, Muad’Dib. They can find you by taking a bearing on its emission.”\n“They'll soon be too busy to find me,” Paul said. “What did the men report?”\n“Our pet Sardaukar have been released near Old Gap low on the rim and are on their way to their master. The rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are in place. The people are deployed as you ordered. It was all routine.”\nPaul glanced across the shallow bowl, studying his men in the filtered light admitted by the camouflage cover. He felt time creeping like an insect working its way across an exposed rock.\n“It'll take our Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop carrier,” Paul said. “They are being watched?”\n“They are being watched,” Stilgar said.\nBeside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. “Hadn't we best be getting to a place of safety?”\n“There is no such place,” Paul said. “Is the weather report still favorable?”\n“A great grandmother of a storm coming,” Stilgar said. “Can you not feel it, Muad’Dib?”\n“The air does feel chancy,” Paul agreed. “But | like the certainty of poling the weather.”\n“The storm’Il be here in the hour,” Stilgar said. He nodded toward the gap that looked out on the Emperor’s hutment and the Harkonnen frigates. “They know it there, too. Not a ‘thopter in the sky. Everything pulled in and tied down. They’ve had a report on the weather from their friends in space.”\n“Any more probing sorties?” Paul asked.\n“Nothing since the landing last night,” Stilgar said. “They know we're here. | think now they wait to choose their own time.”\n“We choose the time,” Paul said.\nGurney glanced upward, growled: “If they let us.”\n“That fleet’ll stay in space,” Paul said.\nGurney shook his head.\n“They have no choice,” Paul said. “We can destroy the spice. The Guild dares not risk that.”\n“Desperate people are the most dangerous,” Gurney said.\n“Are we not desperate?” Stilgar asked.\nGurney scowled at him.\n“You haven't lived with the Fremen dream,” Paul cautioned. “Stil is thinking of all the water we’ve spent on bribes, the years of waiting we’ve added before Arrakis can bloom. He’s not—”\n“Arrrgh,” Gurney scowled.\n“Why’s he so gloomy?” Stilgar asked.\n“He’s always gloomy before a battle,” Paul said. “It’s the only form of good humor Gurney allows himself.”\nA slow, wolfish grin spread across Gurney’s face, the teeth showing white above the chip cut of his stillsuit. “It glooms me much to think on all the poor Harkonnen souls we'll dispatch unshriven,” he said.\nStilgar chuckled. “He talks like a Fedaykin.”\n“Gurney was born a death commando,” Paul said. And he thought: Yes, /et them occupy their minds with small talk before we test ourselves against that force on the plain. He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney, found that the troubadour- warrior had resumed a brooding scowl.\n“Worry saps the strength,” Paul murmured. “You told me that once, Gurney.”\n“My Duke,” Gurney said, “my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them to blast a hole in the Shield Wall...”\n“Those people up there won’t use atomics against us,” Paul said. “They don’t dare...and for the same reason that they cannot risk our destroying the source of the spice.”\n“But the injunction against—”\n“The injunction!” Paul barked. “It’s fear, not the injunction that keeps the Houses from hurling atomics against each other. The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: ‘Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration.’ We’re going to blast the Shield Wall, not humans.”\n“It’s too fine a point,” Gurney said.\n“The hair-splitters up there will welcome any point,” Paul said. “Let’s talk no more about it.”\nHe turned away, wishing he actually felt that confident. Presently, he said: “What about the city people? Are they in position yet?”\n“Yes,” Stilgar muttered.\nPaul looked at him. “What’s eating you?”\n“I never knew the city man could be trusted completely,” Stilgar said.\n“I was a city man myself once,” Paul said.\nStilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. “Muad’Dib knows | did not mean—”\n“I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn’t what you think he'll do. It’s what he actually does. These city people have Fremen blood. It’s just that they haven’t yet learned how to escape their bondage. We'll teach them.”\nStilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: “The habits of a lifetime, Muad’Dib. On the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the communities.”\nPaul\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9243846d64930b9affc0a5da769375818ffb05ad8e59fe5dd18455163e422087_v2"}
