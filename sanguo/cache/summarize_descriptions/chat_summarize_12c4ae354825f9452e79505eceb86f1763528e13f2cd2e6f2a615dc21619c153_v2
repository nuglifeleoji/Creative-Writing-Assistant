In the context of the story, Xiao Yu is depicted as a figure who is deeply engaged in the unfolding events and the complex relationships among various characters. \n\nOne notable aspect of Xiao Yu's characterization is his concern regarding the trustworthiness of other characters, specifically Cai Mao and Zhang Yun.
