曹操见玄德背水下寨，心中疑惑，使人来下战书。孔明批来日决战。次日，两军会于中路五界山前，列成阵势。操出马立于门旗下，两行布列龙凤旌旗，擂鼓三通，唤玄德答话。玄德引刘封、孟达并川中诸将而出。操扬鞭大骂曰：“刘备忘恩失义，反叛朝廷之贼！”玄德曰：“吾乃大汉宗亲，奉诏讨贼。汝上弑母后，自立为王，僭用天子銮舆，非反而何？”操怒，命徐晃出马来战，刘封出迎。交战之时，玄德先走入阵。封敌晃不住，拨马便走。操下令：“捉得刘备，便为西川之主。”大军齐呐喊杀过阵来。蜀兵望汉水而逃，尽弃营寨；马匹军器，丢满道上。曹军皆争取。操急鸣金收军。众将曰：“某等正待捉刘备，大王何故收军？”操曰：“吾见蜀兵背汉水安营，其可疑一也；多弃马匹军器，其可疑二也。可急退军，休取衣物。”遂下令曰：“妄取一物者立斩。火速退兵。”曹兵方回头时，孔明号旗举起：玄德中军领兵便出，黄忠左边杀来，赵云右边杀来。曹兵大溃而逃，孔明连夜追赶。\n\n    操传令军回南郑，只见五路火起，原来魏延、张飞得严颜代守阆中，分兵杀来，先得了南郑。操心惊，望阳平关而走。玄德大兵追至南郑褒州。安民已毕，玄德问孔明曰：“曹操此来，何败之速也？”孔明曰：“操平生为人多疑，虽能用兵，疑则多败。吾以疑兵胜之。”玄德曰：“今操退守阳平关，其势已孤，先生将何策以退之？”孔明曰？“亮已算定了。”便差张飞、魏延分兵两路去截曹操粮道，令黄忠、赵云分兵两路去放火烧山。四路军将，各引向导官军去了。\n\n    却说曹操退守阳平关，令军哨探。回报曰：“今蜀兵将远近小路，尽皆塞断；砍柴去处，尽放火烧绝。不知兵在何处。”操正疑惑间，又报张飞、魏延分兵劫粮。操问曰：“谁敢敌张飞？”许褚曰：“某愿往！”操令许褚引一千精兵，去阳平关路上护接粮草。解粮官接着，喜曰：“若非将军到此，粮不得到阳平矣。”遂将车上的酒肉，献与许褚。褚痛饮，不觉大醉，便乘酒兴，催粮车行。解粮官曰：“日已暮矣，前褒州之地，山势险恶，未可过去。”褚曰：“吾有万夫之勇，岂惧他人哉！今夜乘�\n######################\nOutput:",
