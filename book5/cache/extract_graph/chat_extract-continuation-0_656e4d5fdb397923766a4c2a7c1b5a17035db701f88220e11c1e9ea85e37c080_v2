    “教授，这些事现在不用想，这不是你们要考虑的事情。我们要取得的信息关系到人类文明的存亡，会有人做出最后决定的。”常伟思说。\n     散会时，斯坦顿上校把那个精致的雪茄木盒推到史强面前：“警官，上好的哈瓦纳，送给你了。”\n     四天后，巴拿马运河盖拉德水道。\n     汪淼没有一点儿身处异国他乡的感觉。他知道，西面不远处是美丽的加通湖，东面则是壮丽的美洲大桥和巴拿马城，但他都无缘见到，两天前他乘坐飞机从国内直接飞到巴拿马城附近的托库门军用机场，然后就乘直升机直接来到这里。眼前的景色太平常了，正在进行的运河拓宽工程使两岸山坡上的热带雨林变得稀稀拉拉，坡上露出了大片黄土，那色彩真的使江森感到对这里很熟悉。运河看上去也很普通，可能是因为在这一段它十分狭窄的缘故。这段水道是在上世纪初由十万人一锹锹开凿出来的。\n     汪淼和斯坦顿上校坐在半山坡一座凉亭的躺椅上，两人都穿着宽大的花衬衣，大草帽扔在一边，看上去就是两个普通的游客。在这个位置，下面的运河尽收眼底。\n     就在他们下方的运河两岸上，分别平放着两根二十四米长的钢柱，五十根一百六十米的超强度纳米丝已经按约零点五米的间距连接在两根钢柱上，只是每根纳米丝靠右岸的一端还连接了一段普通钢丝，这可以使纳米丝随着系在上面的坠物沉入河底，这样做是为了让其他的船只通过。好在运河上的运输并不像汪淼想象的那么繁忙，平均每天只有四十艘左右的大型船舶通过。两根钢柱的一端都与活动铰结相连，只有等待“审判日”号前面的最后一艘船通过，才能拉回普通钢丝，把纳米丝在右岸钢柱上做最后固定，然后钢柱才能立起来。行动的代号是“古筝”，这是很自然的联想，而纳米丝构成的切割网则被称为  “琴”\n     一小时前，“审判日”号已由加通湖驶人盖拉德水道。\n     斯坦顿问汪淼以前是否来过巴拿马，汪淼说没有。\n     “我在1999年来过。”上校说。\n     ‘是那次战争吧？”\n     “是，但对我来说是最没有印象的一次战争，只记得在梵蒂冈大使馆前为被包围的诺列加总统播放杰克逊的摇滚舞曲《无处可逃》，那是我的主意。”\n     下面的运河中，一艘通体雪白的法国游轮正在缓缓驶过，铺着绿地毯的甲板上，有几名穿得花花绿绿的游客在闲逛。\n     “二号观察哨报告\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The CIA is a
