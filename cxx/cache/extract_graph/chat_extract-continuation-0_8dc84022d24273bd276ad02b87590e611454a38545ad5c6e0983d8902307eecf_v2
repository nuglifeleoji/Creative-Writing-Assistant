�刚睡着，这之前我一直盯着白花花什么也没有的电视屏幕。我扑过去抓起电话，天啊，居然听到一个大人的声音：“你好，孩子，我是FG，我在帮助你。”\n　　我想问他到底是谁，怎么活下来的，现在在什么地方，还有别的大人活下来吗……\n　　等等一大堆问题，但我一个字还没出口，他又接着说：“听着，你所在的大楼已经失火，现在火已蔓延到第5层。”\n　　我放下电话，从窗子探出身向下看。这时东方已亮，玫瑰星云在西边落下去一半，它的蓝光同晨光混合起来，把城市照得十分怪异。我看看下面，街道上空无一人，至于这座大楼的底部，哪有火的影子？我回身抓起电话，告诉FG这里没有失火。\n　　“不，确实失火了，请照我说的做。”\n　　“你怎么知道的，你在哪里？”\n　　“我在北京。你所在大楼中的火警红外传感器检测到火情，并把信号发送到市公安局的中心计算机，我已同那台计算机对话。”\n　　“我不信！”\n　　“你可以出去摸摸电梯的门，但不要打开电梯，那样危险。”\n　　我照FG的话做了，门外没有什么失火的迹象，但一摸电梯门我大吃一惊，门虽说不上很烫手，也是很热的。记得给每个住户发的防火小册子上说：高层建筑底层失火时，电梯井就像一个火炉上的烟囱，迅速把火抽向上层。我跑回房间里，再从窗子向下看，发现底层刚刚冒出了一大股黄烟，紧接着，二三层的窗子中也有黄烟冒出来。我急忙抓起电话：“告诉我，怎么下去？！”\n　　“电梯和楼梯都已无法通行，你只有从消防滑筒下去。”\n　　“消防滑筒？”\n　　“消防滑筒是一条带松紧的长长的布筒，通过一条特制的防火竖管从楼顶垂到楼底，大楼失火时楼上人员可通过这条布筒滑到楼下，在进入布筒向下滑时，如果速度太快，可用手臂撑住布筒的内壁减速。”\n　　“可我们的楼中安装了这东西吗？”\n　　“安装了。在每层的楼梯口，有一个红色的小铁门，看上去像垃圾道，那就是滑筒的入口。”\n　　“可……你肯定那是滑道吗？要真是个垃圾道，我爬进去不是烧死就是摔死！你是怎么知道这些的？也是从公安局的计算机中吗？”\n　　“不。公安消防部门的计算机应该存有这方面的资料，但FG查遍了那里所有的数据库也没有找到，可能是以文书形式记录的。FG又同设计这幢住宅楼的市建筑设计院的计算机对话，查阅了它存贮的图纸，看到确实安装了滑道。”\n　　“那么楼下呢？别的小朋友呢？！”\n　　“FG正在给他们打电话。”\n　　“等你一个个打完电话我们的楼早烧成灰了！我下楼梯去叫他们！”\n　　“不能去，危险！其它的孩子FG已全部\n######################\nOutput:",
