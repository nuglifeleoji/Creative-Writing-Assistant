It was a test of the Bene Gesserit, of course. These new ones were extremely difficult to detect. They still gave off the characteristic smell of their unique pheromones, though. Odrade had sent that datum in her message to Chapter House.\nThe problem now was to keep the Bene Gesserit knowledge secret. Odrade summoned an acolyte messenger. Indicating the ventilator with a flick of her eyes, Odrade spoke silently with her fingers: “Kill those who listen!”\n“You are too interested in Voice, child,” Odrade said, speaking down to Sheeana in the chair. “Silence is a most valuable tool for learning.”\n“But could | learn Voice? | want to learn it.”\n“I am telling you to be silent and to learn by your silence.”\n“I command you to teach me Voice!”\nOdrade reflected on Kipuna’s reports. Sheeana had established effective Voice control over most of those around her. The child had learned it on her own. An intermediate level Voice for a limited audience. She was a natural. Tuek and Cania and the others were frightened by Sheeana. Religious fantasies contributed to that fear, of course, but Sheeana’s mastery of Voice pitch and tone displayed an admirable unconscious selectivity.\nThe indicated response to Sheeana was obvious, Odrade knew. Honesty. It was a most powerful lure and it served more than one purpose.\n“lam here to teach you many things,” Odrade said, “but | do not do this at your command.”\n“Everyone obeys me!” Sheeana said.\nShe’s barely into puberty and already at Aristocrat level, Odrade thought. Gods of our own making! What can she become?\nSheeana slipped out of her chair and stood looking up at Odrade with a questioning expression. The child’s eyes were on a level with Odrade’s shoulders. Sheeana was going to be tall, a commanding presence. If she survived.\n“You answer some of my questions but you won’t answer others,” Sheeana said. “You said you’d been waiting for me but you won’t explain. Why won’t you obey me?”\n“A foolish question, child.”\n“Why do you keep calling me child?”\n“Are you not a child?”\n“I menstruate.”\n“But you're still a child.”\n“The priests obey me.”\n“They’re afraid of you.”\n“You aren't?”\n“No, I’m not.”\n“Good! It gets tiresome when people only fear you.”\n“The priests think you come from God.”\n“Don’t you think that?”\n“Why should I? We—” Odrade broke off as an acolyte messenger entered. The acolyte’s fingers danced in silent communication: “Four priests listened. They have been killed. All were minions of Tuek.”\nOdrade waved the messenger away.\n“She talks with her fingers,” Sheeana said. “How does she do that?”\n“You ask too many of the wrong questions, child. And you haven’t told me why I should consider you an instrument of God.”\n“Shaitan spares me. | walk on the desert and when Shaitan comes, | talk to him.”\n“Why do you call him Shaitan instead of Shai-hulud?”\n“Everybody asks that same stupid question!”\n“Then give me your stupid answer.”\nThe sullen expression returned to Sheeana’s face. “It’s because of how we met.”\n“And how did you meet?”\nSheeana tipped her head to one side and looked up at Odrade for a moment, then: “That’s a secret.”\n“And you know how to keep secrets?”\nSheeana straightened and nodded but Odrade saw uncertainty in the movement. The child knew when she was being led into an impossible position!\n“Excellent!” Odrade said. “The keeping of secrets is one of a Reverend Mother’s most essential teachings. I’m glad we won’t have to bother with that one.”\n“But | want to learn everything!”\nSuch petulance in her voice. Very poor emotional control.\n“You must teach me everything!” Sheeana insisted.\nTime for the whip, Odrade thought. Sheeana had spoken and postured sufficiently that even a fifth-grade acolyte could feel confident of controlling her now.\nUsing the full power of Voice, Odrade said: “Don’t take that tone with me, child! Not if you wish to learn anything!”\nSheeana went rigid. She was more than a minute absorbing what had happened to her and then relaxing. Presently, she smiled, a warm and open expression. “Oh, I’m so glad you came! It’s been so boring lately.”\nNothing surpasses the complexity of the human mind.\n—LETO II: DAR-ES-BALAT RECORDS\nhe Gammu night, often quickly foreboding in this\nlatitude, was almost two hours away. Gathering clouds Shadowed the Keep. At Lucilla’s command, Duncan had returned to the courtyard for an intense session of self- directed practice.\nLucilla observed from the parapet where she had first watched him.\nDuncan moved in the tumbling twists of the Bene Gesserit eightfold combat, hurling his body across the grass, rolling, flipping himself from side to side, darting up and then down.\nIt was a fine display of random dodging, Lucilla thought. She could see no predictable pattern in his movements and the speed was dazzling. He was almost sixteen SY and already coming onto the platform potential of his prana- bindu endowment.\nThe carefully controlled movements of his training exercises revealed so much! He had responded quickly when she first ordered these evening sessions. The initial step of her instructions from Taraza had been accomplished. The ghola loved her. No doubt of it. She was mother-fixed to him. And it had been accomplished without seriously weakening him, although Teg’s anxieties had been aroused.\nMy shadow is on this ghola but he is not a supplicant nor a dependent follower, she reassured herself. Teg worries about it for no reason.\nJust that morning, she had told Teg, “Wherever his strengths dictate, he continues to express himself freely.”\nTeg should see him right now, she thought. These new practice movements were largely Duncan’s own creation.\nLucilla suppressed a gasp of appreciation at a particularly nimble leap, which took Duncan almost to the center of the courtyard. The ghola was developing a nerve-muscle equilibrium that, given time, might be matched to a psychological equilibrium at least equal to Teg’s. The cultural impact of such an achievement would be awesome. Look at all those who gave instinctive allegiance to Teg and, through Teg, to the Sisterhood.\nWe have the Tyrant to thank for much of that, she thought.\nBefore Leto II, no widespread system of cultural adjustments had ever endured long enough to approach the balance that the Bene Gesserit held as an ideal. It was this equilibrium— “flowing along the blade of a sword’—that fascinated Lucilla. It was why she lent herself so unreservedly to a project whose total design she did not know, but which demanded of her a performance that instinct labeled repugnant.\nDuncan is so young!\nWhat the Sisterhood required of her next had been spelled out explicitly by Taraza: the Sexual Imprint. Only that morning, Lucilla had posed naked before her mirror, forming the attitudes and motions of face and body that she knew she would use to obey Taraza’s orders. In artificial repose, Lucilla had seen her own face appear like that of a prehistoric love goddess—opulent with flesh and the promise of softness into which an aroused male might hurl himself.\nIn her education, Lucilla had seen ancient statues from the First Times, little stone figures of human females with wide hips and sagging breasts that assured abundance for a\nsuckling infant. At will, Lucilla could produce a youthful simulation of that ancient form.\nIn the courtyard below Lucilla, Duncan paused a moment and appeared to be thinking out his next movements. Presently, he nodded to himself, leaped high and twisted in the air, landing like a springbok on one leg, which kicked him sideways into gyrations more akin to dance than to combat.\nLucilla drew her mouth into a tight line of resolution.\nSexual Imprint.\nThe secret of sex was no secret at all, she thought. The roots were attached to life itself. This explained, of course, why her first command-seduction for the Sisterhood had planted a male face in her memory. The Breeding Mistress had told her to expect this and not be alarmed by it. But Lucilla had realized then that the Sexual Imprint was a two- edged sword. You might learn to flow along the edge of the blade but you could be cut by it. Sometimes, when that male face of her first command-seduction returned unbidden into her mind, Lucilla felt confounded by it. The memory came so frequently at the peak of an intimate moment, forcing her to great efforts of concealment.\n“You are strengthened thus,” the Breeding Mistresses reassured her.\nStill, there were times when she felt that she had trivialized something better left a mystery.\nA feeling of sourness at what she must do swept over Lucilla. These evenings when she observed Duncan’s training sessions had been her favorite times each day. The lad’s muscular development showed such definite progress —moving in the growth of sensitive muscle and nerve links —all of the prana-bindu marvels for which the Sisterhood was so famous. The next step was almost upon her, though, and she no longer could sink into watchful appreciation of her charge.\nMiles Teg would come out presently, she knew. Duncan’s training would move again into the practice room with its more deadly weapons.\nTeg.\nOnce more, Lucilla wondered about him. She had felt herself more than once attracted to him in a particular way that she recognized immediately. An Imprinter enjoyed some latitude in selecting her own breeding partners, provided she had no prior commitments nor contrary orders. Teg was old but his records suggested he might still be virile. She would not be able to keep the child, of course, but she had learned to deal with that.\nWhy not? she had asked herself.\nHer plan had been simple in the extreme. Complete the Imprint on the ghola and then, registering her intent with Taraza, conceive a child by the redoubtable Miles Teg. Practical introductory seduction had been indicated, but Teg had not succumbed. His Mentat cynicism stopped her one afternoon in the dressing chamber off the Weapons Room.\n“My breeding days are over, Lucilla. The Sisterhood should be satisfied with what | already have given.”\nTeg, clad only in black exercise leotards, finished wiping his sweaty face with a towel and dropped the towel into a hamper. He spoke without looking at her: “Would you please leave me now?”\nSo he saw through her overtures!\nShe should have anticipated that, Teg being who he was. Lucilla knew she might still seduce him. No Reverend Mother of her training should fail, not even with a Mentat of Teg’s obvious powers.\nLucilla stood there a moment undecided, her mind automatically planning how to circumvent this preliminary rejection. Something stopped her. Not anger at the rejection, not the remote possibility that he might indeed be proof against her wiles. Pride and its possible fall (there was always that possibility) had little to do with it.\nDignity.\nThere was a quiet dignity in Teg and she had the certain knowledge of what his courage and prowess had already given to the Sisterhood. Not quite sure of her motives, Lucilla turned away from him. Possibly it was the underlying gratitude that the Sisterhood felt toward him.
