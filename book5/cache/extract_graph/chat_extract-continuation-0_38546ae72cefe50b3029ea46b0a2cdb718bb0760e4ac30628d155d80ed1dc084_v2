以展示她那腐朽的资产阶级生活方式。\n　　叶文洁推开阮雯的家门，发现抄家后混乱的房间变得整洁了，那几幅被撕的油画又贴糊好挂在墙上，歪倒的钢琴也端正地立在原位，虽然已被砸坏不能弹了，但还是擦得很干净，残存的几本精装书籍也被整齐地放回书架上．．．．．．阮雯端坐在写字台前的那把转椅上，安详地闭着双眼。叶文洁站在她身边，摸摸她的额头、脸和手，都是冰凉的，其实文洁在进门后就注意到了写字台上倒放着的那个已空的安眠药瓶。她默默地站了一会儿，转身走去，悲伤已感觉不到了，她现在就像一台盖革计数仪，当置身于超量的辐射中时，反而不再有任何反应，没有声响，读数为零。但当她就要出门时，还是回过头来最后看了阮雯一眼，她发现阮老师很好地上了妆，她抹了口红，也穿上了高跟鞋。\n2．寂静的春天\n　　两年以后，大兴安岭。\n　　“顺山倒咧——”\n　　随着这声嘹亮的号子，一棵如巴特农神庙的巨柱般高大的落叶松轰然倒下，叶文洁感到大地抖动了一下。她拿起斧头和短锯，开始从巨大的树身上去掉枝丫。每到这时，她总觉得自己是在为一个巨人整理遗体。她甚至常常有这样的想象：这巨人就是自己的父亲。两年前那个凄惨的夜晚，她在太平间为父亲整理遗容时的感觉就在这时重现。巨松上那绽开的树皮，似乎就是父亲躯体上累累的伤痕。\n　　内蒙古生产建设兵团的六个师四十一个团十多万人就分布在这辽阔的森林和草原之间。刚从城市来到这陌生的世界时，很多兵团知青都怀着一个浪漫的期望：当苏修帝国主义的坦克集群越过中蒙边境时，他们将飞快地武装起来，用自己的血肉构成共和国的第一道屏障。事实上，这也确实是兵团组建时的战略考虑之一。但他们渴望的战争就像草原天边那跑死马的远山，清晰可见，但到不了眼前，于是他们只有垦荒、放牧和砍伐。这些曾在“大串联”中燃烧青春的年轻人很快发现，与这广阔天地相比，内地最大的城市不过是个羊圈；在这寒冷无际的草原和森林间，燃烧是无意义的，一腔热血喷出来，比一堆牛粪凉得更快，还不如后者有使用价值。但燃烧是他们的命运，他们是燃烧的一代。\n　　于是，在他们的油锯和电锯下，大片的林海化为荒山秃岭；在他们的拖拉机和康拜因(联合收割机)下，大片的草原被犁成\n######################\nOutput:",
