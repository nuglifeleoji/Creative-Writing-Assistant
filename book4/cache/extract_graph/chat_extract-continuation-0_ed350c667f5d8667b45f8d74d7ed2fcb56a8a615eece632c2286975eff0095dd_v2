�前，那场挫折，又瘦了许多，额头上还留着火罐拔下的黑印。他笑着说：“这是好事嘛！还要你给我解释哩？你办这么大的事，别说一个月，两个月三个月也值得！” \n　　田福堂心里十分高兴少安找了个媳妇回来。这样，他就再不要担心他女儿和少安的关系了。他关切地问少安：“准备什么时候办事？” \n　　少安说：“想春节就办。可我那个家，事办得再简单，也很难凑合起来……” \n　　田福堂立刻说“不要怕！要粮食，你就在大队储备粮里拿；要什么粮食你就盘什么粮食，要多少你就盘上多少！” \n　　少安对书记的这个应诺倒很高兴——这总算给他解决了一个大困难。他说：“这就好了，我正为这事犯愁着哩！我也不敢多借，借下还得还嘛！我借一点够过事情就行了……”少安和田福堂临分手时，书记还一再关切地说：“你有什么困难就言传！我帮助你解决！” \n　　现在，少安一个人又匆匆往家里赶去。一路上，他心想：我回去先瞒着家庭里的其他人，和母亲商量一下，把家里的白面拿出一升来，晚上给二爸家拿过去，好让他们撑一下门面。他想到他明天早上还得和秀莲一块去吃这白面时，便又忍不住笑了。 \n                  第30章\n　　第二天早上，当少安和秀莲坐在孙玉亭家的烂席片炕上吃白面片的时候，他父亲正坐在金俊海家的椅子上，心事重重地抽着旱烟。孙玉厚心里高兴的是，他这一趟来的正好，碰巧金俊海今天刚到家！ \n　　俊海两口子到田家圪崂那面公路上搬东西去了——俊海的汽车刚从黄原路过这里。他们安顿让他在家里等一会儿。金波金秀都在学校没回来，因此这个院落现在里里外外静悄悄的没一点声响。孙玉厚可以在这时间里盘算他怎样开口对俊海说他的难肠事。 \n　　他是为儿子的婚事，来向金俊海家开口借钱的。当少安把秀莲带回家门时，孙玉厚高兴得不知如何是好。啊呀，他的儿子有媳妇了！他没想到事情会这么顺利；而且少安带回来的这女娃娃，又体面又精明，真是打上灯笼都找不见的好人材。更使老汉高兴的是，女方果真象他弟媳妇贺凤英说的，连一个财礼钱也不要！ \n　　这几天，尽管这一切都真实地摆在他面前，但他老觉得这好象是做梦：天下哪有这么好的事出现在他孙玉厚的面前呢？ \n　　可这一切又的的确确是事实。而且人家女娃娃主动提出，春节就要和他的少安结婚哩！ \n　　提起结婚的事，这才使高兴得晕晕乎乎的孙玉厚脑子凉了下来。他马上�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂
