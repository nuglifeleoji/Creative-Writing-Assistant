“他那强烈的个性即使事隔多年仍烙印在我的记忆中，否则我也不会察觉到。”\n   “不管怎样，只能说那家伙运气不好。”草S说着开始朝马路走去，但他发现汤川没跟来，立刻停下脚。“不要去‘天亭’吗？”\n    汤川低着头走近草S。\n    “我想提出一个对你来说很残酷哦要求，可以吗？”\n    草S苦笑，“那得看是什么内容。”\n    “你愿意基于朋友的身份听我说吗？你能舍弃刑警的身份吗？”\n

“当然是庆祝那个凶手被捕，这下子你也能摆脱那个案子了。我也不用再小心翼翼地保持距离。既然不用再担心被刑警缠着不放，当然应该举杯庆祝一下。”\n    工藤的声音听起来轻浮又自大。他不知道案情背景当然会有这种反应，但靖子实在提不起兴致配合他。\n    我没那个心情，她说。\n    为什么？工藤问。发现靖子默然不语，他才好像察觉什么似地说：啊，我懂了。\n
