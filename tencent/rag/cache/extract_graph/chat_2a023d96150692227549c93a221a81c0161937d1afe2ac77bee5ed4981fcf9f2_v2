He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: “Hawat told me that house was secure!”\nPaul spoke hesitantly: “I was angry, too—at first. And | blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would’ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others—including Hawat.”\n“Are you defending him?” the Duke demanded.\n“Yes,”\n“He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—”\n“He’s wise with much experience,” Paul said. “How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?”\n“I should be the one defending him,” the Duke said. “Not you.”\nPaul smiled.\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s. “You’ve...matured lately, Son.” He lifted his hand. “It gladdens me.” He matched his son’s smile. “Hawat will punish himself. He’ll direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him.”\nPaul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the night’s blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.\nThe door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more\nleathery than ever. He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.\n“My Lord,” he said, speaking to a point over Leto’s head, “I have just learned how | failed you. It becomes necessary that | tender my resig—”\n“Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,” the Duke said. He waved to the chair across from Paul. “If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn’t count on simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training. You didn’t fail there!” He tapped the back of the empty chair. “Sit down, I say!”\nHawat sank into the chair. “But—”\n“FIL hear no more of it,” the Duke said. “The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?”\n“I asked them to wait outside while |—”\n“Call them in.”\nHawat looked into Leto’s eyes. “Sire, |—”\n“I know who my true friends are, Thufir,” the Duke said. “Call in the men.”\nHawat swallowed. “At once, my Lord.” He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: “Gurney, bring them in.”\nHalleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.\n“There’s coffee for those who want it,” the Duke said.\nHe looked over his men, thinking: They're a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.\nPresently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.\n“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “our civilization appears to’ve fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.”\nDry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.\n“I think first we’d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen,” the Duke said. “Thufir?”\nHawat glanced up. “I’ve some economic matters to go into after my general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need. They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly. They’ve sent us a gift—stillsuits of their own manufacture...maps of certain desert areas Surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind....” He glanced down at the table. “Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with\nthe Judge of the Change. They’ve also sent some incidental things—jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.”\n“You like these people, Thufir?” asked a man down the table.\nHawat turned to face his questioner. “Duncan Idaho says they’re to be admired.”\nPaul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: “Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?”\nHawat looked at Paul. “From food processing and other evidence, Idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We’ve reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.”\n“That’s something new,” Leto said.\n“It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.”\nAnother man down the table cleared his throat, asked: “Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?”\n“A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen- day journey.”\n“It appears,” the Duke said, “that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We Shouldn’t worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet—it’s always done. But to have\nthem completely outside our observation—that’s not good.”\n“You have a plan, Sire,” Hawat asked.\nThe Duke looked at Halleck. “Gurney, | want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them l'Il ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.”\n“What if the Emperor gets wind of this?” Halleck asked. “He’s very jealous of his CHOAM profits, m’Lord.”\nLeto smiled. “We'll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight that! And we'll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system. No more graft!”\nA grin twisted Halleck’s face. “Ahh, m’Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would that | could see the Baron’s face when he learns of this.”\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. “Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?”\n“Yes, my Lord. They’re being examined in detail even now. I’ve skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.”\n“Give it, then.”\n“The Harkonnens took ten billion solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.”\nA muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some\nboredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.\nHalleck murmured: “‘For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.’”\n“You see, gentlemen,” Leto said. “Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?”\nThere was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.\n“We will have to take it at the point of the sword,” Leto said. He turned to Hawat. “This’d be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and Supporting equipment have they left us?”\n“A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord,” Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. “They neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands—that everything the Harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart. We'll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it’s still working six months from now.”\n“Pretty much as we expected,” Leto said. “What’s the firm estimate on basic equipment?”\nHawat glanced at his folder. “About nine hundred and thirty harvester factories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty\nornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation...carryalls, a little under a thousand.”\nHalleck said: “Wouldn’t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?”\nThe Duke looked at Hawat. “Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?”\n“We must pursue other avenues for now,” Hawat said. “The Guild agent wasn’t really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain—one Mentat to another—that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.”\nOne of Halleck’s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: “There’s no justice in this!”\n“Justice?” The Duke looked at the man. “Who asks for justice? We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis—win or die. Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?”\nThe man stared at the Duke, then: “No, Sire. You couldn’t turn and | could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but....” He shrugged. “...we must all feel bitter at times.”\n“Bitterness | understand,” the Duke said. “But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind.”\nHalleck stirred, said: “I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as ‘Leto the Just’ and\npromise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.”\n“They don’t know yet who’s going to win this exchange,” the Duke said. “Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2a023d96150692227549c93a221a81c0161937d1afe2ac77bee5ed4981fcf9f2_v2"}
