Once, just once, the God Emperor had cried out to his majordomo: “Moneo! Sometimes | think you were made by the Ixians!”\nMoneo felt the lift stop. The door opened and he looked out across the crypt at the shadowy bulk on the Royal Cart. There was no indication that Leto had noticed the arrival. Moneo sighed and began the long walk through the echoing gloom. There was a body on the floor near the cart. No need for déja vu. This was merely familiar.\nOnce, in Moneo’s early days of service, Leto had said: “You don’t like this place, Moneo. | can see that.”\n“No, Lord.”\nWith just a little prodding of memory, Moneo could hear his own voice in that naive past. And the voice of the God Emperor responding:\n“You don’t think of a mausoleum as a comforting place, Moneo. | find it a source of infinite strength.”\nMoneo remembered that he had been anxious to get off this topic. “Yes, Lord.”\nLeto had persisted: “There are only a few of my ancestors here. The water of Muad’Dib is here. Ghani and Harg al-Ada are here, of course, but they’re not my ancestors. No, if there’s any true crypt of my ancestors, /am that crypt. This is mostly the Duncans and the products of my breeding program. You'll be here someday.”\nMoneo found that these memories had slowed his pace. He sighed and moved a bit faster. Leto could be violently impatient on occasion but there was still no sign from him. Moneo did not take this to mean that his approach went unobserved.\nLeto lay with his eyes closed and only his other senses to record Moneo’s progress across the crypt. Thoughts of Siona had been occupying Leto’s attention.\nSiona is my ardent enemy, he thought. / do not need Nayla’s words to confirm this. Siona is a woman of action. She lives on the surface of enormous energies which fill me with fantasies of delight. | cannot contemplate those living energies without a feeling of ecstasy. They are my reason for being, the justification for everything | have ever done... even for the corpse of this foolish Duncan in front of me now.\nLeto’s ears told him that Moneo had not yet crossed half the distance to the Royal Cart. The man moved slower and Slower, then picked up his pace.\nWhat a gift Moneo has given me in this daughter, Leto thought. Siona is fresh and precious. She is the new while | am a collection of the obsolete, a relic of the damned, of the lost and strayed. | am the waylaid pieces of history which sank out of sight in all of our pasts. Such an accumulation of riffraff has never before been imagined.\nLeto paraded the past within him then to let them observe what had happened in the crypt.\nThe minutiae are mine!\nSiona, though. . . Siona was like a clean slate upon which great things might yet be written.\n| guard that slate with infinite care. | am preparing it, Cleansing it.\nWhat did the Duncan mean when he called out her name?\nMoneo approached the cart diffidently yet consummately aware. Surely Leto did not sleep.\nLeto opened his eyes and looked down as Moneo came to a stop near the corpse. At this moment, Leto found the majordomo a delight to observe. Moneo wore a white Atreides uniform with no insignia, a subtle comment. His face, almost as well known as Leto’s, was all the insignia he needed. Moneo waited patiently. There was no change of expression on his flat, even features. His thick, sandy hair lay in a neat, equally divided part. Deep within his gray eyes there was that look of directness which went with knowledge of great personal power. It was a look which he modified only in the God Emperor’s presence, and sometimes not even there. Not once did he glance toward the body on the crypt’s floor.\nWhen Leto continued silent, Moneo cleared his throat, then: “I am saddened, Lord.”\nExquisite! Leto thought. He knows | feel true remorse about the Duncans. Moneo has seen their records and has seen enough of them dead. He knows that only nineteen Duncans died what people usually refer to as natural deaths.\n“He had an Ixian lasgun,” Leto said.\nMoneo’s gaze went directly to the gun on the floor of the crypt off to his left, demonstrating that he already had seen it. He returned his attention to Leto, sweeping a glance down the length of the great body.\n“You are injured, Lord?”\n“Inconsequential.”\n“But he hurt you.”\n“Those flippers are useless to me. They will be entirely gone within another two hundred years.”\n“I will dispose of the Duncan’s body personally, Lord,” Moneo said. “Is there...”\n“The piece of me he burned away is entirely ash. We will let it blow away. This is a fitting place for ashes.”\n“As my Lord says.”\n“Before you dispose of the body, disable the lasgun and keep it where | can present it to the Ixian ambassador. As for the Guildsman who warned us about it, present him personally with ten grams of spice. Oh—and our priestesses on Giedi Prime should be alerted to a hidden store of melange there, probably old Harkonnen contraband.”\n“What do you wish done with it when it’s found, Lord?”\n“Use a bit of it to pay the Tleilaxu for the new ghola. The rest of it can go into our stores here in the crypt.”\n“Lord.” Moneo acknowledged the orders with a nod, a gesture which was not quite a bow. His gaze met Leto’s.\nLeto smiled. He thought: We both know that Moneo will not leave without addressing directly the matter which most concerns us.\n“I have seen the report on Siona,” Moneo said.\nLeto’s smile widened. Moneo was such a pleasure in these moments. His words conveyed many things which did not require open discussion between them. His words and actions were in precise alignment, carried on the mutual awareness that he, of course, spied on everything. Now, there was a natural concern for his daughter, but he wished it understood that his concern for the God Emperor remained paramount. From his own traverse through a similar evolution, Moneo knew with precision the delicate nature of Siona’s present fortunes.\n“Have | not created her, Moneo?” Leto asked. “Have | not controlled the conditions of her ancestry and her\nupbringing?”\n“She is my only daughter, my only child, Lord.”\n“In a way, she reminds me of Harq al-Ada,” Leto said. “There doesn’t appear to be much of Ghani in her, although that has to be there. Perhaps she harks back to our ancestors in the Sisterhood’s breeding program.”\n“Why do you say that, Lord?”\nLeto reflected. Was there need for Moneo to know this peculiar thing about his daughter? Siona could fade from the prescient view at times. The Golden Path remained, but Siona faded. Yet... she was not prescient. She was a unique phenomenon... and if she survived. . . Leto decided he would not cloud Moneo’s efficiency with unnecessary information.\n“Remember your own past,” Leto said.\n“Indeed, Lord! And she has such a potential, so much more than | ever had. But that makes her dangerous, too.”\n“And she will not listen to you,” Leto said.\n“No, but | have an agent in her rebellion.”\nThat will be Topri, Leto thought.\nIt required no prescience to know that Moneo would have an agent in place. Ever since the death of Siona’s mother, Leto had known with increasing sureness the course of Moneo’s actions. Nayla’s suspicions pinpointed Topri. And now, Moneo paraded his fears and actions, offering them as the price of his daughter’s continued safety.\nHow unfortunate he fathered only the one child on that mother.\n“Recall how | treated you in similar circumstances,” Leto said. “You know the demands of the Golden Path as well as | do.”\n“But | was young and foolish, Lord.”\n“Young and brash, never foolish.”\nMoneo managed a tight smile at this compliment, his thoughts leaning more and more toward the belief that he now understood Leto’s intentions. The dangers, though!\nFeeding his belief, Leto said: “You know how much | enjoy Surprises.”\nThat is true, Leto thought. Moneo does know it. But even while Siona surprises me, she reminds me of what I fear most—the sameness and boredom which could break the Golden Path. Look at how boredom put me temporarily in the Duncan’s power! Siona is the contrast by which | know my deepest fears. Moneo’s concern for me is well grounded.\n“My agent will continue to watch her new companions, Lord,” Moneo said. “I do not like them.”\n“Her companions? | myself had such companions once long ago.”\n“Rebellious, Lord? You?” Moneo was genuinely surprised.\n“Have | not proved a friend of rebellion?”\n“But Lord...”\n“The aberrations of our past are more numerous than you may think!”\n“Yes, Lord.” Moneo was abashed, yet still curious. And he knew that the God Emperor sometimes waxed loquacious after the death of a Duncan. “You must have seen many rebellions, Lord.”\nInvoluntarily, Leto’s thoughts sank into the memories aroused by these words.\n“Ahhh, Moneo,” he muttered. “My travels in the ancestral mazes have memorized uncounted places and events which | never desire to see repeated.”\n“I can imagine your inward travels, Lord.”\n“No, you cannot. | have seen peoples and planets in such numbers that they lose meaning even in imagination. Ohhh, the landscapes I have passed. The calligraphy of alien roads glimpsed from space and imprinted upon my innermost sight. The eroded sculpture of canyons and cliffs and galaxies has imprinted upon me the certain knowledge that |I am a mote.”\n“Not you, Lord. Certainly not you.”\n“Less than a mote! | have seen people and their fruitless societies in such repetitive posturings that their nonsense fills me with boredom, do you hear?”\n“I did not mean to anger my Lord.” Moneo spoke meekly.\n“You don’t anger me. Sometimes you irritate me, that is the extent of it. You cannot imagine what | have seen— caliphs and mjeeds, rakahs, rajas and bashars, kings and emperors, primitos and presidents—I’ve seen them all. Feudal chieftains, every one. Every one a little pharaoh.”\n“Forgive my presumption, Lord.”\n“Damn the Romans!” Leto cried.\nHe spoke it inwardly to his ancestors: “Damn the Romans!”\nTheir laughter drove him from the inward arena.\n“| don’t understand, Lord,” Moneo ventured.\n“That’s true. You don’t understand. The Romans broadcast the pharaonic disease like grain farmers scattering the seeds of next season’s harvest—Caesars, kaisers, tsars, imperators, caseris ...palatos ... damned pharaohs!”\n“My knowledge does not encompass all of those\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan is a recurring figure in the God Emperor's life, often associated with the breeding program and the crypt of ancestors\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The God Emperor Leto II is a central figure, a ruler with prescient abilities and a vast ancestral memory, guiding the Golden Path\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is the God Emperor's majordomo, a trusted advisor with deep knowledge of Leto's plans and concerns, including his daughter Siona\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is Moneo's daughter and a rebellious figure, seen as both a threat and a vital part of the God Emperor's plans\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixians are a technologically advanced group, known for their dependability and creations like the lasgun\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ROYAL CART<|>GEO<|>The Royal Cart is a significant location in the crypt where the God Emperor resides\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPT<|>GEO<|>The crypt is a mausoleum-like space holding the remains of Duncans and others from the breeding program, a place of strength for Leto\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>A prison mentioned in passing, possibly holding significance in the broader narrative\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is Leto's grand plan for humanity's survival, guiding his actions and decisions\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BREEDING PROGRAM<|>EVENT<|>The breeding program is a key initiative by Leto to shape humanity's future, producing figures like the Duncans and Siona\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Moneo serves as the God Emperor's majordomo, deeply involved in his plans and concerns<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>MONEO<|>Siona is Moneo's daughter, and he is deeply concerned for her safety and role in the God Emperor's plans<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Siona is a key figure in the God Emperor's plans, seen as both a threat and a vital part of the Golden Path<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Duncan is a recurring figure in the God Emperor's life, often associated with the breeding program and the crypt<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIANS<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>The Ixians' technology, like the lasgun, plays a role in the God Emperor's world, sometimes as a threat<|>5)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>CRYPT<|>Moneo frequently visits the crypt, a place of significance in his service to the God Emperor<|>4)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>CRYPT<|>The crypt is a source of strength for the God Emperor, holding the remains of his breeding program<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>The Golden Path is the God Emperor's grand plan for humanity, guiding all his actions<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>BREEDING PROGRAM<|>The breeding program is a key initiative by Leto to shape humanity's future<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
