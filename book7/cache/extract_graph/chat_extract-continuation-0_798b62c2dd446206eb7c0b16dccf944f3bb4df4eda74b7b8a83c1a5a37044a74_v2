不，‘无法相信’这个说法还不够适切，应该说我压根就不相信。他……石神在说谎。他为何要说谎？既然背上杀人犯的污名，照理说就算再撒谎也毫无意义，但他却说了谎。理由只有一个。那就是这个谎，并非为他自己而说，他是为了某人隐瞒真相。”\n    靖子咽下口水，拼命调整呼吸。\n    此人已经隐约察觉真相了，她想。他知道石神只是在包庇某人，真凶另有其人，所以他想救石神。该怎么救呢？最快的方法，当然就是让真凶去自首。让真凶招认一切。\n    靖子提心吊胆的窥视着汤川，没想到他竟然在笑。\n    “你好像以为我是来说服你的。”\n    “不，我没有……”靖子慌忙摇头，“而且说到说服，我有什么可让您说服的？”\n    “说的也是。我的确说错话了，我道歉。”他低头鞠躬，“不过我只是想让你知道一件事，所以才来找你。”\n    “到底是什么事？”\n    “这个嘛，”汤川学停顿了一下才开口，“我想说的是，你对真相毫无所知。”\n    靖子惊讶地瞪大了眼，汤川已经不笑了。\n    “我想你的不在场证明，大概是真的。”他继续说，“你应该真的去过电影院，包括令媛也是，你们母女并未说谎。”\n    “对，没错，我们根本没说谎，那又怎样？”\n    “但你心里应该也在奇怪，为什么你们用不着说谎，为何警方的追查这么松懈？因为他……我是说石神，早已安排好让你们面对刑警的质问时，只要说实话就行了。无论警方怎么步步进逼，他都已安排好让警方无法将你定罪。至于他到底是怎么安排的，我想你大概不知道。你只晓得石神好像用了什么巧妙的障眼法，却不清楚实际内容。我说的对吗？”\n    “您在说什么，我一点也听不懂。”靖子对他一笑，但是连她自己也知道脸颊在抽搐。\n    “他为了保护你们母女做了极大的牺牲，那是你我这种普通人连想都想像不到的壮烈牺牲。我想他大概打从命案一发生，就已做好最坏的打算，决定到时要替你们顶罪了，因为他的所有计划都是以那个为前提设计出来的。反过来说，唯有那个前提绝对不能瓦解。但那个前提实在太残酷，任谁都会退缩，这点石神自己也知道。所以，为了让自己在紧要关头无法反悔，他事先断了自己的退路。同时，那也正是这次最惊人的障眼法。”\n    汤川的话令靖子开始混乱，因为她完全无法理解他在说什么。然而，却又有一种卫击非比寻常的预感。\n    此人说的没错，靖子完全不知道石神设计了什么障眼法。同时，她也的确感到奇怪，为何刑警对自己的攻击没有想像中激烈。老实说她甚至觉得刑警们\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
