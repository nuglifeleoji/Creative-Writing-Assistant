These family members are significant in the narrative, as they represent the support system and emotional connections that the elderly individual relies on. Additionally, the description highlights a tragic aspect of the family dynamic, indicating that the narrator has lost these family members due to the actions of a malevolent force, described as \"魔鬼\" (the devil). This loss has profoundly impacted the narrator, as it not only signifies the physical absence of loved ones but also suggests a deeper emotional and psychological struggle stemming from the violence inflicted upon them.
