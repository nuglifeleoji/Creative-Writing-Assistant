“闭嘴，立刻登舰。你知不知道联邦那些老家伙有多么可怕？难道你想把战神殿的人引来？亦或是唐门或者是史莱克学院的人？你要想死，就自己从楼顶跳下去，不要连累整个罪恶之城。”永夜君王冰冷的声音传来，没有情绪波动，却让詹京机灵灵打了个寒颤。\n\n    永夜君王提到的这几个名字，对他来说，可真的是如雷贯耳啊！\n\n    “没有、没有，我当然没那个意思。那就撤退吧。不过，第四小队失联了。”詹京一边抛向接引光束，一边说道。\n\n    “不管他们，失联了就让他们去死吧。立刻离开。信号封锁时间已经到极限了。”\n\n    光芒一闪，詹京也已经消失在接引光束之中。\n\n    下一瞬，他已经来到了隐形战舰内部。\n\n    这艘战舰体积虽然不大，但速度却奇快无比，能以亚光速飞行。就算是当今联邦之中，小型战舰最快的也就不过如此。\n\n    尤其是隐形魂导器，不但本身先进，还有十位擅长于隐匿能力的魂师来主控，这可是罪恶之城能够来去自如，甚至是在全联邦作恶的重要保障。\n\n    所以，当詹京登上战舰之后，整个人顿时放松下来，这次任务算是圆满完成了。\n\n    其他匪徒们上了战舰也都解除自身微型机甲，当他们看到詹京的时候，每个人脸上都不禁流露出狂热之色。\n\n    詹京本身的个人实力只能说是一般，但却绝对是一位犯罪大师，这次的作战计划实际上就是他完全制定的。哪怕是永夜君王，也是作为整体的指挥者而出现。\n\n    可以说，虽然詹京只是罪恶之城十二使者之一，但他在罪恶之城的地位可是相当之高。就连城主都对他青睐有加。\n\n    淡淡的微笑浮现在面庞上，詹京优哉游哉的在自己的位置上坐了下来。\n\n    “除第四小队失联之外，其他成员全部登船完毕。”驾驶舱内有信息传出。\n\n    “那就走吧。让我们凯旋而归，回去之后，罪恶之都将会张开他的怀抱，迎接所有勇士的归来。哈哈哈哈！”詹京大笑着下达了命令。\n\n    隐形战舰缓缓在原地悬浮掉转，舰首扬起，背后尾焰积蓄能量。下一瞬，两束强盛的光焰骤然喷吐而出，带着这艘长达百米的战舰冲天而起。几乎在瞬间就破开了音障，直奔高空而去。\n\n    战舰表面，扭曲的光芒浮现，即将进入隐形状态。而这一切一旦完成，那可就真的是海阔凭鱼跃、天高任鸟飞了。就算是联邦卫星的雷达都无法锁定它们。更不知道它们会到什么地方去。这可是一艘能够在太空�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
