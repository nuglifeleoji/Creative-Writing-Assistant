。后人有诗曰：“弱草微尘尽达观，夏侯有女义如山。丈夫不及裙钗节，自顾须眉亦汗颜。”却说司马懿斩了曹爽，太尉蒋济曰：“尚有鲁芝、辛敞斩关夺门而出，杨综夺印不与，皆不可纵。”懿曰：“彼各为其主，乃义人也。”遂复各人旧职。辛敞叹曰：“吾若不问于姊，失大义矣！”后人有诗赞辛宪英曰：“为臣食禄当思报，事主临危合尽忠。辛氏宪英曾劝弟，故令千载颂高风。”\n\n    司马懿饶了辛敞等，仍出榜晓谕：但有曹爽门下一应人等，尽皆免死；有官者照旧复职。军民各守家业，内外安堵。何、邓二人死于非命，果应管辂之言。后人有诗赞管辂曰：“传得圣贤真妙诀，平原管辂相通神。鬼幽鬼躁分何邓，未丧先知是死人。”却说魏主曹芳封司马懿为丞相，加九锡。懿固辞不肯受。芳不准，令父子三人同领国事。懿忽然想起：“曹爽全家虽诛，尚有夏侯玄守备雍州等处，系爽亲族，倘骤然作乱，如何提备？必当处置。”即下诏遣使往雍州，取征西将军夏侯玄赴洛阳议事。玄叔夏侯霸听知大惊，便引本部三千兵造反。有镇守雍州刺史郭淮，听知夏侯霸反，即率本部兵来，与夏侯霸交战。淮出马大骂曰：“汝既是大魏皇族，天子又不曾亏汝，何故背反？”霸亦骂曰：“吾祖父于国家多建勤劳，今司马懿何等匹夫，灭吾兄曹爽宗族，又来取我，早晚必思篡位。吾仗义讨贼，何反之有？”淮大怒，挺枪骤马，直取夏侯霸。霸挥刀纵马来迎。战不十合，淮败走，霸随后赶来。忽听的后军呐喊，霸急回马时，陈泰引兵杀来。郭淮复回，两路夹攻。霸大败而走，折兵大半；寻思无计，遂投汉中来降后主。\n\n    有人报与姜维，维心不信，令人体访得实，方教入城。霸拜见毕，哭告前事。维曰：“昔微子去周，成万古之名：公能匡扶汉室，无愧古人也。”遂设宴相待。维就席问曰：“今司马懿父子掌握重权，有窥我国之志否？”霸曰：“老贼方图谋逆，未暇及外。但魏国新有二人，正在妙龄之际，若使领兵马，实吴、蜀之大患也。”维问：“二人是谁？”霸告曰：“一人现为秘书郎，乃颍川长社人，姓钟，名会，字士季，太傅钟繇之子，幼有胆智。繇尝率二子见文帝，会时年七岁，其兄\n######################\nOutput:",
