“是没什么往来，不过花冈小姐――花冈小姐就是我隔壁邻居，我倒是常去她工作的便当店，这点我忘了告诉草S刑警了。”\n    “嗯――便当店啊。”汤川点头。\n    “我不是因为她在那上班才去买，只是她凑巧在我习惯去的店上班，因为那店就在学校附近。”\n    “是吗？不过就算只是点头之交，听说她是嫌疑犯还是会不舒服吧？”\n    “那倒不会，反正跟我无关。”\n    “说的也是。”\n    汤川似乎并未特别起疑。\n    两人在七点半出门。汤川没走向最近的森下车站，却表示要陪石神一起走到高中旁，这样好像可以少换一趟车。\n    汤川已不再提起命案和花冈靖子。他本来还怀疑汤川是受草S支托来刺探什么消息的，不过看来好像是自己多心了。归根究底，草S本来就没有任何理由必须用上这种手段来\n\n刺探石神。\n    “这条上班路线还挺有意思的。”汤川说这话时，他们已经穿过新大桥下，开始沿着隅田川步行。他会这样说，应该是因为看到一整排游民的住处。\n    把花白的头发绑在脑后的男人正在晒衣服。前方，那个被石神称为“罐男”的男人正按照惯例压扁空罐。\n    “这幅景象总是一成不变。”石神说，“这一个月以来，什么都没变，他们活得就像时钟一样正确。”\n    “人一旦摆脱了时钟的束缚反而会变成这样。”\n    “我有同感。”\n    他们在青州桥前走上台阶。办公大楼紧贴一旁而建，石神看着两个映在一楼玻璃门上的身影，微微抬头。\n    “不过话说回来，你看起来永远都这么年轻，跟我差了十万八千里。你的头发也很茂密。”\n    “哪里，别看我这样，其实也老多了。撇开头发不说，脑袋好像都变钝了。”\n    “你太贪心了。”\n    石神虽然嘴上说笑，心理却有点紧张，再这样下去汤川恐怕会一路跟到“天亭”。对于花冈靖子和自己的关系，这个洞察力过人的天才物理学家该不会察觉到什么端倪吧？他\n\n开始有点不安。此外，看到石神和陌生男子一起光顾，也难保靖子不会露出狼狈神色。\n    就在可以看到便当店招牌时，石神开口：“那就是刚才提到的便当店。”\n    “嗯――‘天亭’”啊，店名挺有趣的。”\n    “今天我也要去买便当。”\n    “是吗？那么我就在这跟你分手了。”汤川停下脚。\n    石神虽感意外，但还是暗自庆幸。\n    “没能好好招待你真不好意思。”\n    “我已经享受到最好的招待了。”汤川眯起眼，“你已经不想回大学做研究了吗？”\n    石神摇头。\n
