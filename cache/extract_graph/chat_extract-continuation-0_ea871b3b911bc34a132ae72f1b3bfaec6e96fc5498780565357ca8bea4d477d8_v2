They thought it had been destroyed!”\n“Send down a light so | can explore it,” Odrade called.\n“The priests ask that we leave it undisturbed!”\n“Send me a light!” Odrade insisted.\nPresently, a dark object tumbled down the sandslope ina small spill of sand. Odrade sent Sheeana scampering for it. A touch on the switch and a bright beam went lancing at the dark archway beyond the catchbasin. Yes, more basins there. And beside this basin, a narrow stairway cut into the\nrock. The steps led upward, turning and removing themselves from her view.\nOdrade bent and whispered in Sheeana’s ear. “Watch Waff carefully. If he moves after us, call out.”\n“Yes, Mother. Where are we going?”\n“I must look at this place. | am the one who has been brought here for a purpose.” She raised her voice and addressed Waff: “Waff, please wait there for the rope.”\n“What have you been whispering?” he demanded. “Why must | wait? What are you doing?”\n“| have been praying,” Odrade said. “Now, | must continue this pilgrimage alone.”\n“Why alone?”\nIn the old language of the Islamiyat, she said: “It is written.”\nThat stopped him!\nOdrade led the way at a fast walk toward the rock stairs.\nSheeana, hurrying along beside Odrade, said: “We must tell people about this place. The old Fremen caves are safe from Shaitan.”\n“Be still, child,” Odrade said. She aimed the light up into the stairway. It curved through the rock, angling sharply to the right up there. Odrade hesitated. The warning sense of danger she had felt at the beginning of this venture came back intensified. It was an almost palpable thing within her.\nWhat is up there?\n“Wait here, Sheeana,” Odrade said. “Don’t let Waff follow me.”\n“How can | stop him?” Sheeana glanced fearfully back across the chamber where Waff stood.\n“Tell him it is God’s will that he remain. Say it this way...” Odrade bent close to Sheeana and repeated the words in Waff’s ancient language, then: “Say nothing else. Stand in his way and repeat it if he tries to pass.”\nSheeana mouthed the new words quietly. She had them, Odrade saw. The girl was quick.\n“He’s afraid of you,” Odrade said. “He won’t try to harm you.”\n“Yes, Mother.” Sheeana turned, folded her arms across her breast and looked across the chamber at Waff.\nAiming the light ahead of her, Odrade went up the rock Stairs. Sietch Tabr! What surprise have you left for us here, old worm?\nIn a long low hallway at the top of the stairs, Odrade came on the first desert-mummified bodies. There were five of them, two men and three women, no identifying marks or clothing on them. They had been completely stripped and left for the desert’s dryness to preserve. Dehydration had pulled skin and flesh tightly around the bones. The bodies were propped in a row, their feet extended across the passage. Odrade was forced to step over each of these macabre obstructions.\nShe passed her handlight across each body as she went. They had been stabbed almost identically. A slashing blade had been thrust upward just below the arch of the sternum.\nRitual killings?\nDryly puckered flesh had been withdrawn from the wounds, leaving a dark spot to mark them. These bodies were not from Fremen times, Odrade knew. Fremen death stills made ashes of all flesh to recover a body’s water.\nOdrade probed ahead with her light and paused to consider her position. Discovery of the bodies intensified her sense of peril. / should have brought a weapon. But that would have aroused Waff’s suspicions.\nThe persistence of that inner warning could not be evaded. This relic of Sietch Tabr was perilous.\nThe beam of her light revealed another stairway at the end of this hall. Cautiously, Odrade moved forward. At the first step, she sent the beam of her light probing upward. Shallow steps. Only a little way up, more rock—a wider Space up there. Odrade turned and sent the light stabbing\naround this hallway. Chips and burn marks scarred the rock walls. Once more, she looked up the stairway.\nWhat is up there?\nThe sense of danger was intense.\nOne slow step at a time, pausing often, Odrade climbed. She emerged into a larger passage hewn through the native rock. More bodies greeted her. These had been abandoned in the disarray of their final moments. Again, she saw only mummified flesh stripped of clothing. They lay scattered along this wider passage—twenty of them. She wove her way around them. Some had been stabbed in the same way as the five on the lower level. Some had been slashed and hacked and burned by lasgun beams. One had been beheaded and the skin-masked skull lay against a wall of the passage like a ball abandoned from some terrible game.\nThis new passage led straight ahead past openings into Small chambers on both sides. She saw nothing of value in the small chambers where she sent her probing light: a few scattered strands of spice fiber, small spills of melted rock, melt bubbles occasionally on floors, walls, and ceilings.\nWhat violence was this?\nSuggestive stains could be seen on some of the chamber floors. Spilled blood? One chamber had a tiny mound of brown cloth in a corner. Scraps of torn fabric scattered under Odrade’s foot.\nThere was dust. Dust everywhere. Her feet stirred it up in passing.\nThe passage ended at an archway that gave onto a deep ledge. She sent her light beyond the ledge: an enormous chamber, far larger than the one down below. Its curved ceiling went so high she knew it must extend into the rock base of the great wall. Wide, shallow steps led down from the ledge onto the chamber floor. Hesitantly, Odrade went down the steps and out onto the floor. She sent her light sweeping all around. Other passages led out of the great chamber. Some, she saw, had been blocked by stone and\nthe stones torn away to be left scattered on the ledge and on this great floor.\nOdrade sniffed the air. Carried on the dust stirred up by her feet there was a definite smell of melange. The smell wove through her sense of peril. She wanted to leave, hurry back to the others. But the danger was a beacon. She had to learn where that beacon led.\nShe knew where she was now, though. This was the great gathering chamber of Sietch Tabr, site of countless Fremen spice orgies and tribal convocations. Here, the Naib Stilgar had presided. Gurney Halleck had been here. The Lady Jessica. Paul Muad’Dib. Chani, mother of Ghanima. Here, Muad’Dib trained his fighters. The original Duncan Idaho was here... and the first Idaho ghola!\nWhy have we been brought here? What is the danger?\nIt was here, right here! She could feel it.\nIn this place, the Tyrant had concealed a spice hoard. Bene Gesserit records said the hoard had filled this entire chamber to the ceiling and into many of the surrounding passages as well.\nOdrade pivoted, her gaze following the path of her light. Over there was the ledge of the Naibs. And there, the deeper Royal Ledge Muad’Dib had commissioned.\nAnd there is the archway where I entered.\nShe sent her light along the floor, noting places where searchers had chipped and burned the rock seeking more of the Tyrant’s fabulous hoard. Fish Speakers had taken most of that melange, its hiding place revealed by the Idaho ghola who had been consort of the famed Siona. The records said subsequent searchers had found more caches hidden behind false walls and floors. There were many authenticated accounts and the verifications of Other Memories. The Famine Times had seen violence here when desperate searchers won through to this place. That might explain the bodies. Many had fought just for the chance to search Sietch Tabr.\nAs she had been taught, Odrade tried to use her sense of danger as a guide. Did the miasma of past violence cling to these stones after all of those millennia? That was not her warning. Her warning was something immediate. Odrade’s left foot encountered an uneven place on the floor. Her light picked out a dark line in the dust. She scattered the dust with a foot, revealing a letter and then an entire word burned in a flowing script.\nOdrade read the word silently and then aloud.\n“Arafel.”\nShe knew this word. Reverend Mothers of the Tyrant’s time had impressed it into the Bene Gesserit consciousness, tracing its roots out to the most ancient sources.\n“Arafel: the cloud darkness at the end of the universe.”\nOdrade felt the gasping accumulation of her warning sense. It focused on that single word.\n“The Tyrant’s holy judgment,” the priests called that word. “The cloud darkness of holy judgment!”\nShe moved out along the word, staring down at it, noting the curling at the end that trailed off into a small arrow. She looked where the arrow pointed. Someone else had seen the arrow and had cut into the ledge where it pointed. Odrade crossed to where the searcher’s burner had left a darker pool of melted rock on the chamber floor. Streams of melted stone ran out in fingers away from the ledge, each finger trailing from a deep hole burned into the rock of the ledge.\nBending, Odrade peered into each hole with her light: Nothing. She sensed the treasure hunter’s excitement riding on her warning-fear. The extent of the wealth this chamber had once held staggered imagination. In the worst of the old times, a hand-carried luggage case could hold enough spice to buy a planet. And the Fish Speakers had squandered this hoard, losing it in squabbles and shattering misjudgments and ordinary foolishness too picayune for history to record. They had been glad to accept Ixian alliance when the Tleilaxu broke the melange monopoly.\nDid the searchers find it all? The Tyrant was superbly Clever.\nArafel.\nAt the end of the universe.\nHad he sent a message down the eons to the Bene Gesserit of today?\nShe cast the beam of her light once more around the chamber and then upward.\nThe ceiling described an almost perfect half globe overhead. It had been intended, she knew, as a model of the night sky seen from the entrance to Sietch Tabr. But even by the time of Liet Kynes, the first planetologist here, the original stars painted on that ceiling had been gone, lost in the tiny rock chippings of small quakes and the everyday abrasions of life.\nOdrade’s breath quickened. The sense of peril had never been greater. The danger beacon shone within her! Quickly, she trotted directly across to the steps where she had descended to this floor. Turning there, she cast backward in her mind for Other Memories to limn this place. They came Slowly, forcing past that heart-pounding sense of doom. Pointing the beam of her light upward and peering along it, Odrade placed those ancient memories over the scene in front of her.\nBits of reflected brilliance!\nOther Memories positioned them: indicators of the stars in a long-gone sky and right there! The silvery-yellow half circle of the Arrakeen sun.
