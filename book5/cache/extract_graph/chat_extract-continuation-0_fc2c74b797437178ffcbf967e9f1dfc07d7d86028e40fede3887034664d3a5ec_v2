了，它有着哥特式的塔顶，直插凌晨的天空，使他想起了昨天早晨在王府井看到的罗马式教堂，但那座教堂要是放到金字塔旁边，不过是它的一个小门亭而已。他还看到了远方许多显然是干仓的建筑，但形状也都变成了哥特式建筑，尖顶细长，仿佛是大地长出的许多根刺。\n   汪淼看到了金字塔上一个透出幽幽火光的洞门，就走了进去。洞内的墙壁上，一排已被熏得黝黑的奥林匹斯诸神的雕像举着火炬。走进大殿，发现这里甚至比门洞中还昏暗，只有一张长长的大理石桌上的两枝银烛台上的蜡烛在昏昏欲睡地亮着，桌旁坐着几个人，昏暗的光线使汪淼仅能看清他们面庞的轮廓，他们的双眼都隐藏在深眼窝的阴影中看不到，但汪淼能感觉到聚集到他身上的目光。这些人似乎穿着中世纪的长袍，仔细看，还有一两个人的长袍更简洁一些，是古希腊式的。长桌的一头坐着一个瘦高的男子，他头上戴着的金冠是大殿中除蜡烛外唯一闪亮的东西，汪淼在蜡烛的光亮中很费力地看出，他身上的长袍与其他人不同，是红色的。\n   到此汪淼确定了自己的判断：这个游戏是为每个玩家单开一个进程，现在的欧洲中世纪副本，是软件根据他的ID而选定的。\n   “你来晚了，会议已经开始很久了。”戴金冠穿红袍的人说，“我是格里高利教皇。”\n   汪淼努力回忆着自己并不熟悉的欧洲中世纪史，想从这个名字推断出这个文明进化的程度，但想到三体世界中历史的混乱，又觉得这种努力没有多大意义。\n   “你改了ID，可我们都认识你，在以前的两次文明中，你好像到东方游历过。哦，我是亚历士多德。”穿古希腊长袍的人说，他有一头白色的鬈发：\n   “是的，”汪淼点点头，“我在那里目睹了两次文明的毁灭，一次毁于严寒．一次毁于烈日。我还看到了东方的学者们为掌握太阳运行规律而进行的伟大努力。”\n   “嗤！”一个留着上翘山羊胡，比教皇更瘦的人在阴影中发出声音，“东方学者，企图从冥想、顿悟甚至梦游中参透太阳运行的秘密，可笑之极！\"\n   “这是伽利略。”亚历士多德介绍说，“他主张应该从实验和观测中认识世界，一个工匠式的思想家，但他已取得的成果我们还是不得不正视。”\n   “墨子也进行了实验和观测。”汪淼说。\n   伽利略又嗤了一声，“墨子的思想仍是东方的，他不过是披着科学外衣的玄学家，从来就没有认真对待过自己的观测结果，就凭着主观臆测建立宇宙\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金字塔<|>GEO<|>The pyramid is a
