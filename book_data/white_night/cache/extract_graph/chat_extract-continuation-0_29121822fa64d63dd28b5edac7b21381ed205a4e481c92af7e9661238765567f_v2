计划赶不上变化，他现在只能是原地冥想，尝试着快一点恢复自己的精神力，好在后面的战斗中发挥作用。\n\n    不过，凭借着他的召唤，他们小组已经赢了三场，奠定了坚实的基础。\n\n    光芒一闪，又是三道身影出现在对面。\n\n    没等这三道身影变得凝实，早已有了定计的蓝轩宇和刘锋主动出击，猛的向前冲去。\n\n    蓝轩宇率先起步，右脚跺地，力量全部灌注在小腿之中，下一瞬，整个人已经如同炮弹一般冲出，与此同时，右手金纹蓝银草反卷，覆盖手掌。\n\n    白光一闪，刘锋后发先至，凭借着整个高能少年班首屈一指的速度，瞬间就到了蓝轩宇身前。\n\n    蓝轩宇右手按出，按在刘锋背上，一股巨大推力传来的同时，还有炽热和狂躁的血脉波动。\n\n    刘锋手中白龙枪龙头双眸金光迸射，三寸枪芒喷吐而出，他整个人的精气神在瞬间就已经变得不同。\n\n    整个擂台也不过就三十米而已，两人这一冲一推，刘锋的速度已经达到了极致。\n\n    对面三人才刚刚显现出身影来，刘锋就已经到了近前。\n\n    白龙枪向前甩出，刘锋几乎是手握在长枪最末端，白龙枪横扫接上挑，一下将对面三人全部笼罩在自己的枪势之中。\n\n    擂台战斗，魂师出现到战斗，总需要有一个释放武魂的过程。而对于擂主来说，最大的优势也就是一个先手了。\n\n    而此时蓝轩宇和刘锋，正是借助了这个先手之势，将其发挥到了极致。\n\n    那三名学员才刚刚出现，白龙枪就已经到了，以至于他们还没反应过来，三个人就觉得一股大力传来，同时被卷起上甩，身形失控。\n\n    刘锋的速度太快了，一枪挑起三人，手中白龙枪在空中略微一凝，一股沛然强悍的锋锐之气爆发，白龙枪凌空下劈，化为一道锋芒从天而降，目标所指，正是中央的那名学员。\n\n    受到白龙枪那一挑的影响，可惜这三位学员甚至连武魂都还没来得及释放出来，又怎么可能挡得住刘锋这一枪呢？\n\n    当中学员的身体顿时被枪锋从额头上划下，身体被一分为二，化为光芒消失无踪。\n\n    而此时，后面的蓝轩宇也已经追了上来，腾身而起，撞向空中刘锋。当两人身体接近的瞬间，他右手一推，在空中帮刘锋完成了一个变向，帮他冲向右侧先前被卷起，刚刚在下落过程中勉强释放出武魂的那名学员，而自己则借助反震之力扑向左侧学员。\n\n    刘锋\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
