时正当六月炎天，其热如火。有后人咏南方苦热诗曰：“山泽欲焦枯，火光覆太虚。不知天地外，暑气更何如！”又有诗曰：“赤帝施权柄，阴云不敢生。云蒸孤鹤喘，海热巨鳌惊。忍舍溪边坐？慵抛竹里行。如何沙塞客，擐甲复长征！”孔明统领大军，正行之际，忽哨马飞报：“孟获退往秃龙洞中不出，将洞口要路垒断，内有兵把守；山恶岭峻，不能前进。”孔明请吕凯问之，凯曰：“某曾闻此洞有条路，实不知详细。”蒋琬曰：“孟获四次遭擒，既已丧胆，安敢再出？况今天气炎热，军马疲乏，征之无益；不如班师回国。”孔明曰：“若如此，正中孟获之计也。吾军一退，彼必乘势追之。今已到此，安有复回之理！”遂令王平领数百军为前部；却教新降蛮兵引路，寻西北小径而入。前到一泉，人马皆渴，争饮此水。王平探有此路，回报孔明。比及到大寨之时，皆不能言，但指口而已。孔明大惊，知是中毒，遂自驾小车，引数十人前来看时，见一潭清水，深不见底，水气凛凛，军不敢试。孔明下车，登高望之，四壁峰岭，鸟雀不闻，心中大疑。忽望见远远山冈之上，有一古庙。孔明攀藤附葛而到，见一石屋之中，塑一将军端坐，旁有石碑，乃汉伏波将军马援之庙：因平蛮到此，土人立庙祀之。孔明再拜曰：“亮受先帝托孤之重，今承圣旨，到此平蛮；欲待蛮方既平，然后伐魏吞吴，重安汉室。今军士不识地理，误饮毒水，不能出声。万望尊神，念本朝恩义，通灵显圣，护佑三军！”祈祷已毕，出庙寻土人问之。隐隐望见对山一老叟扶杖而来，形容甚异。孔明请老叟入庙，礼毕，对坐于石上。孔明问曰：“丈者高姓？”老叟曰：“老夫久闻大国丞相隆名，幸得拜见。蛮方之人，多蒙丞相活命，皆感恩不浅。”孔明问泉水之故，老叟答曰：“军所饮水，乃哑泉之水也，饮之难言，数日而死。此泉之外，又有三泉：东南有一泉，其水至冷，人若饮水，咽喉无暖气，身躯软弱而死，名曰柔泉；正南有一泉，人若溅之在身，手足皆黑而死，名曰黑泉；西南有一泉，沸如热汤，人若浴之，皮肉尽脱而死，名曰灭泉。敝处有此四泉，毒气所聚，无药可治，又烟瘴甚起，惟未、申、酉三个时辰可往来\n######################\nOutput:",
