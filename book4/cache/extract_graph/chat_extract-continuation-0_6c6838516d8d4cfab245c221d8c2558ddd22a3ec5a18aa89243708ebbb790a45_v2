炕边上溜下来，走到他面前，大方地帮助他把褡裢从肩胛上卸下来。他丈人贺耀宗和他父亲，正亲热地挤在下炕根一块抽旱烟。后锅台上，母亲、姐姐和妹妹正笼罩在一片蒸气中，忙着给客人做饭。 \n　　一股热流刹那间涌上了少安的胸腔。他激动地问秀莲和老丈人：“你们刚到？路上顺利不顺利？” \n　　贺耀宗说：“顺利着哩！我和秀莲在柳林打问了一辆去黄原的顺车，一直就开到你们家的坡底下！” \n　　秀莲不时用眼睛瞄一下他刚理过的头发，满含着羞涩和喜爱。因为两家的老人都在，她不好表示她的感情，但不时用她那双会说话的眼睛对他表示：我多么想你啊！同时还用这双眼睛询问他：你想我了吗？ \n　　是的，亲爱的人。从今往后，我们就要开始在一块生活罗。但愿你能永远象现在一样，爱我，全心帮助我，和我共同撑扶这个穷家薄业吧……在快要临近春节的一天，孙少安和贺秀莲就在自己家里举行了一个简朴的婚礼。 \n　　婚礼尽管简朴，但也少不了应有的纷乱。亲戚们在前一天下午就先后都来赶事情了。少安的几个姨姨、姨夫、舅舅、妗子，再加上各自带的娃娃，都涌在他家的一孔土窑洞里，脚地上挤得都不能通行了。 \n　　王满银原来准备在举行婚礼这一天再来，但也在前一天的晚饭前赶到了——因为按老乡俗这晚上有一顿荞面合烙。他啃了几天干粮，实在撑架不住饥饿，因此赶来吃上一顿，晚上再返回罐子村睡觉。当然，第二天他一早就又跑来了，生怕误了坐席。 \n　　这天午饭前，少平已经挨门逐户把村里的队干部以及和他们相好人家的主事人都请来了。窑里太挤，这些本村的客人，就都在少安家的院子里一堆一伙拉闲话，等待坐席。少平和金波每人手里拿一盒纸烟，满院子转着给众人散。院子里撑一辆新自行车——这是公社文书刘根民的。他刚从石圪节赶来，也是这个婚礼上唯一的国家干部。 \n　　第一轮坐席的是少安的娘舅亲和村里的队干部。炕上同时开两桌。后炕头是亲戚，前炕头是社队干部。少安他奶被少平临时背到邻居家，否则他老人家的一堆烂被褥要占很大一个炕面。 \n　　在前炕头的干部席上，正中坐着田福堂，他两边坐着公社文书刘根民和队里的副书记金俊山；接下来金俊武、田海民、田福高等人依次围成一圈。孙玉亭虽说也应该坐在这一席上，但\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
