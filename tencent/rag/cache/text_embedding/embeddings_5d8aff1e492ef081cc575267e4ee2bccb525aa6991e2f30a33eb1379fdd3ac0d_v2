the desert.”\nSometimes she used a thumper, sometimes she danced her summons. Far out on the sands beyond the sight of Keen or any other inhabited place, the worms came to her. Sheeana alone in front of a worm talked to it while others listened. Tamalane found the accumulated recordings fascinating as they passed through her hands on their way to Chapter House.\n“I should hate you!”\nWhat a turmoil that caused among the priests! Tuek wanted an open debate: “Should all of us hate the Divided God at the same time we love Him?”\nStiros barely shut off this suggestion with the argument that God’s wishes had not been made clear.\nSheeana asked one of her gigantic visitors: “Will you let me ride you again?”\nWhen she approached, the worm retreated and would not let her mount.\nOn another occasion, she asked: “Must | stay with the priests?”\nThis particular worm proved to be the target of many questions, and among them:\n“Where do people go when you eat them?”\n“Why are people false to me?”\n“Should | punish the bad priests?”\nTamalane laughed at that final question, thinking of the turmoil it would cause among Tuek’s people. Her spies duly reported the dismay of the priests.\n“How does He answer her?” Tuek asked. “Has anyone heard God respond?”\n“Perhaps He speaks directly into her soul,” a councillor ventured.\n“That’s it!” Tuek leaped at this offering. “We must ask her what God tells her to do.”\nSheeana refused to be drawn into such discussions.\n“She has a pretty fair assessment of her powers,” Tamalane reported. “She’s not going into the desert very much now despite Stiros’ proddings. As we might expect, the attraction has waned. Fear and elation will carry her just so far before paling. She has, however, learned an effective command:\n“Go away!”\nThe Sisterhood marked this as an important development. When even the Divided God obeyed, no priest or priestess was about to question her authority to issue such a command.\n“The priests are building towers in the desert,” Tamalane reported. “They want more secure places from which to observe Sheeana when she does go out there.”\nThe Sisterhood had anticipated this development and had even done some of its own prodding to speed up the projects. Each tower had its own windtrap, its own maintenance staff, its own water barrier, gardens and other elements of civilization. Each was a small community spreading the established areas of Rakis farther and farther into the domain of the worms.\nPioneer villages no longer were necessary and Sheeana got the credit for this development.\n“She is our priestess,” the populace said.\nTuek and his councillors spun on the point of a pin: Shaitan and Shai-hulud in one body? Stiros lived in daily fear that Tuek would announce the fact. Stiros’ advisors finally rejected the suggestion that Tuek be translated. Another suggestion that Priestess Sheeana have a fatal accident was greeted with horror by all, even Stiros finding it too great a venture.\n“Even if we remove this thorn, God may visit us with an even more terrible intrusion,” he said. And he warned: “The oldest books say that a little child shall lead us.”\nStiros was only the most recent among those who looked upon Sheeana as something not quite mortal. It was observable that those around her, Cania included, had come to love Sheeana. She was so ingenuous, so bright and responsive.\nMany observed that this growing affection for Sheeana extended even to Tuek.\nFor the people touched by this power, the Sisterhood had an immediate recognition. The Bene Gesserit knew a label for this ancient effect: expanding worship. Tamalane reported profound changes moving through Rakis as people everywhere on the planet began praying to Sheeana instead of to Shaitan or even to Shai-hulud.\n“They see that Sheeana intercedes for the weakest people,” Tamalane reported. “It is a familiar pattern. All goes as ordered. When do you send the ghola?”\nThe outer surface of a balloon is always larger than the center of the damned thing! That’s the whole point of the Scattering!\n—BENE GESSERIT RESPONSE TO AN IXIAN SUGGESTION THAT NEW INVESTIGATIVE PROBES BE SENT OUT AMONG THE LOST ONES\nO ne of the Sisterhood’s swifter lighters took Miles Teg up to the Guild Transport circling Gammu. He did not like leaving the Keep at this moment but the priorities were obvious. He also had a gut reaction about this venture. In his three centuries of experience, Teg had learned to trust his gut reactions. Matters were not going well on Gammu. Every patrol, every report of remote sensors, the accounts of Patrin’s spies in the cities—everything fueled Teg’s disquiet.\nMentat fashion, Teg felt the movement of forces around the Keep and within it. His ghola charge was threatened. The order for him to report aboard the Guild Transport prepared for violence, however, came from Taraza herself with an unmistakable crypto-identifier on it.\nOn the lighter taking him upward, Teg set himself for battle. Those preparations he could make had been made. Lucilla was warned. He felt confident about Lucilla. Schwangyu was another matter. He fully intended to discuss with Taraza a few essential changes in the Gammu Keep. First, though, he had another battle to win. Teg had not the slightest doubt that he was entering combat.\nAs his lighter moved in to dock, Teg looked out a port and saw the gigantic Ixian symbol within the Guild cartouche on the Transport’s dark side. This was a ship the Guild had converted to Ixian mechanism, substituting machines for the traditional navigator. There would be Ixian technicians\naboard to service the equipment. A genuine Guild navigator would be there, too. The Guild had never quite learned to trust a machine even while they paraded these converted Transports as a message to Tleilaxu and Rakians.\n“You see: we do not absolutely require your melange!”\nThis was the announcement contained in that giant symbol of Ix on the spaceship’s side.\nTeg felt the slight lurch of the docking grapples and took a deep, quieting breath. He felt as he always did just before battle: Empty of all false dreams. This was a failure. The talking had failed and now came the contest of blood... unless he could prevail in some other way. Combat these days was seldom a massive thing but death was there nonetheless. That represented a more permanent kind of failure. /f we cannot adjust our differences peacefully we are less than human.\nAn attendant with the unmistakable signs of Ix in his speech guided Teg to the room where Taraza waited. All along the corridors and in the pneumotubes carrying him to Taraza, Teg looked for signs to confirm the secret warning in the Mother Superior’s message. All seemed serene and ordinary—the attendant properly deferential toward the Bashar. “I was a Tireg commander at Andioyu,” the attendant said, naming one of the almost-battles where Teg had prevailed.\nThey came to an ordinary oval hatch in the wall of an ordinary corridor. The hatch opened and Teg entered a white-walled room of comfortable dimensions—sling chairs, low side tables, glowglobes tuned to yellow. The hatch slid into its seals behind him with a solid thump, leaving his guide behind him in the corridor.\nA Bene Gesserit acolyte parted the gossamer hangings that concealed a passage on Teg’s right. She nodded to him. He had been seen. Taraza would be notified.\nTeg suppressed a trembling in his calf muscles.\nViolence?\nHe had not misinterpreted Taraza’s secret warning. Were his preparations adequate? There was a black sling chair at his left, a long table in front of it and another chair at the end of the table. Teg went to this side of the room and waited with his back to the wall. The brown dust of Gammu still clung to his boot toes, he noted.\nPeculiar smell in the room. He sniffed. Shere! Had Taraza and her people armed themselves against an Ixian Probe? Teg had taken his usual shere capsule before embarking on the lighter. Too much knowledge in his head that might be useful to an enemy. The fact that Taraza left the smell of shere around her quarters had another implication: It was a statement to some observer whose presence she could not prevent.\nTaraza entered through the gossamer hangings. She appeared tired, he thought. He found this remarkable because the Sisters were capable of concealing fatigue until almost ready to drop. Was she actually low in energy or was this another gesture for hidden observers?\nPausing just into the room, Taraza studied Teg. The Bashar appeared much older than when she had last seen him, Taraza thought. Duty on Gammu was having its effect, but she found this reassuring. Teg was doing his job.\n“Your quick response is appreciated, Miles,” she said.\nAppreciated! Their agreed word for “We are being watched secretly by a dangerous foe.”\nTeg nodded while his gaze went to the hangings where Taraza had entered.\nTaraza smiled and moved farther into the room. No signs of the melange cycle in Teg, she observed. Teg’s advanced years always raised the suspicion that he might resort to the leavening effect of the spice. Nothing about him revealed even the faintest hint of the melange addiction that even the strongest sometimes turned to when they felt their end approaching. Teg wore his old uniform jacket of Supreme Bashar but without the gold starbursts at shoulder and\ncollar. This was a signal she recognized. He said: “Remember how | earned this in your service. | have not failed you this time, either.”\nThe eyes that studied her were level; no hint of judgment escaped them. His entire appearance spoke of quiet within, everything at variance with what she knew must be occurring in him at this moment. He awaited her signal.\n“Our ghola must be awakened at the first opportunity,” she said. She waved a hand to silence him as he started to respond. “I have seen Lucilla’s reports and | know he is too young. But we are required to act.”\nShe spoke for the watchers, he realized. Were her words to be believed?\n“I now give you the order to awaken him,” she said and she flexed her left wrist in the confirmation gesture of their secret language.\nIt was true! Teg glanced at the hangings that concealed the passage where Taraza had entered. Who was it listening there?\nHe put his Mentat talents to the problem. There were missing pieces but that did not stop him. A Mentat could work without certain pieces if he had enough to create a pattern. Sometimes, the sketchiest outline was enough. It supplied the hidden shape and then he could fit the missing pieces to complete a whole. Mentats seldom had all the data they might desire, but he was trained to sense patterns, to recognize systems and wholeness. Teg reminded himself now that he also had been trained in the ultimate military sense: You trained a recruit to traina weapon, to aim the weapon correctly.\nTaraza was aiming him. His assessment of their situation had been confirmed.\n“Desperate attempts will be made to kill or capture our ghola before you can awaken him,” she said.\nHe recognized her tone: the coldly analytic offering of data to a Mentat. She saw that he was in Mentat mode,\nthen.\nThe Mentat pattern-search rolled through his mind. First, there was the Sisterhood’s design for the ghola, largely unknown to him,", ".

She saw that he was in Mentat mode,\nthen.\nThe Mentat pattern-search rolled through his mind. First, there was the Sisterhood’s design for the ghola, largely unknown to him, but ranging somehow around the presence of a young female on Rakis who (so they said) could command worms. Idaho gholas: charming persona and with something else that had made the Tyrant and the Tleilaxu repeat him countless times. Duncans by the shipload! What service did this ghola provide that the Tyrant had not let him remain among the dead? And the Tleilaxu: They had decanted Duncan Idaho gholas from their axlotl tanks for millennia, even after the death of the Tyrant. The Tleilaxu had sold this ghola to the Sisterhood twelve times and the Sisterhood had paid in the hardest currency: melange from their own precious stores. Why did the Tleilaxu accept in payment something they produced so copiously? Obvious: to deplete the Sisterhood’s supplies. A special form of greed there. The Tleilaxu were buying supremacy—a power game!\nTeg focused on the quietly waiting Mother Superior. “The Tleilaxu have been killing our gholas to control our timing,” he said.\nTaraza nodded but did not speak. So there was more. Once again, he fell into Mentat mode.\nThe Bene Gesserit were a valuable market for the Tleilaxu melange, not the only source because there was always the trickle from Rakis, but valuable, yes; very valuable. It was not reasonable that the Tleilaxu would alienate a valuable market unless they had a more valuable market standing ready.\nWho else had an interest in Bene Gesserit activities? The Ixians without a doubt. But Ixians were not a good market for melange. The Ixian presence on this ship spoke of their independence. Since Ixians and Fish Speakers made common cause, the Fish Speakers could be set aside from this pattern quest.\nWhat great power or assemblage of powers in this universe possessed...\nTeg froze that thought as though he had applied the dive brakes in a ‘thopter, letting his mind float free while he sorted other considerations.\nNot in this universe.\nThe pattern took shape. Wea/th. Gammu assumed a new role in his Mentat computations. Gammu had been gutted long ago by the Harkonnens, abandoned as a festering carcass, which the Danians had restored. There was a time, though, when even Gammu’s hopes were gone. Without hopes there had not even been dreams. Climbing from that cesspool, the population had employed only the basest pragmatism. /f it works, it is good.\nWealth.\nIn his first survey of Gammu he had noted the numbers of banking houses. They were even marked, some of them, as Bene Gesserit-safe. Gammu served as the fulcrum for manipulation of enormous wealth. The bank he had visited to study its use aS an emergency contact came back fully into his Mentat awareness. He had realized at once that the place did not confine itself to purely planetary business. It was a bankers’ bank.\nNot just wealth but WEALTH.\nA Prime Pattern development did not come into Teg’s mind but he had enough for a Testing Projection. Wealth not of this universe. People from the Scattering.\nAll of this Mentat sorting had taken only a few seconds. Having reached a testing point, Teg set himself loose-of- muscle and nerve, glanced once at Taraza and strode across to the concealed entry. He noted that Taraza gave no sign of alarm at his movements. Whipping aside the hangings, Teg confronted a man almost as tall as himself: military-style clothing with crossed spears at the collar tabs. The face was heavy, the jaws wide; green eyes. A look of surprised\nalertness, one hand poised above a pocket that bulged obviously with a weapon.\nTeg smiled at the man, let the hangings fall and returned to Taraza.\n“We are being observed by people from the Scattering,” he said.\nTaraza relaxed. Teg’s performance had been memorable. The hangings swished aside. The tall stranger entered and stopped about two paces from Teg. A glacial expression\nof anger gripped his features.\n“|I warned you not to tell him!” The voice was a grating baritone with an accent new to Teg.\n“And | warned you about the powers of this Mentat Bashar,” Taraza said. A look of loathing flashed across her features.\nThe man subsided and a subtle look of fear came over his face. “Honored Matre, I|—”\n“Don’t you dare call me that!” Taraza’s body tensed ina fighting posture that Teg had never before seen her display.\nThe man inclined his head slightly. “Dear lady, you do not control the situation here. | must remind you that my orders\nTeg had heard enough. “Through me, she does control here,” he said. “Before coming here | set certain protective measures in motion. This...” he glanced around him and returned his attention to the intruder, whose face now bore a wary expression “...is not a no-ship. Two of our no-ship monitors have you in their sights at this moment.”\n“You would not survive!” the man barked.\nTeg smiled amiably. “No one on this ship would survive.” He clenched his jaw to key the nerve signal and activate the tiny pulsetimer in his skull. It played its graphic signals against his visual centers. “And you don’t have much time in which to make a decision.”\n“Tell him how you knew to do this,” Taraza said.\n“The Mother Superior and | have our own private means of communication,” Teg said. “But further than that, there was no need for her to warn me. Her Summons was enough. The Mother Superior on a Guild Transport at a time like this? Impossible!”\n“Impasse,” the man growled.\n“Perhaps,” Teg said. “But neither Guild nor Ix will risk a total and all-out attack by Bene Gesserit forces under the command of a leader trained by me. | refer to the Bashar Burzmali. Your Support has just dissolved and vanished.”\n“I told him nothing of this,” Taraza said. “You have just witnessed the performance of a Mentat Bashar, which | doubt could be equaled in your universe. Think of that if you consider going against Burzmali, a man trained by this Mentat.”\nThe intruder looked from Taraza to Teg and back to Taraza.\n“This is the way out of our seeming impasse,” Teg said. “The Mother Superior Taraza and her entourage leave with me. You must decide immediately. Time is running out.”\n“You're bluffing.” There was no force in the words.\nTeg faced Taraza and bowed. “It has been a great honor to serve you, Reverend Mother Superior. | bid you farewell.” “Perhaps death will not part us,” Taraza said. It was the\ntraditional farewell of a Reverend Mother to a Sister-equal.\n“Go!” The heavy-featured man dashed to the corridor hatchway and flung it open, revealing two Ixian guards, looks of surprise on their faces. His voice hoarse, the man ordered: “Take them to their lighter.”\nStill relaxed and calm, Teg said: “Summon your people, Mother Superior.” To the man standing at the hatchway, Teg said: “You value your own skin too much to be a good soldier. None of my people would have made such an error.”\n“There are true Honored Matres aboard this ship,” the man grated. “I am sworn to protect them.”\nTeg grimaced and turned to where Taraza was leading her people from the adjoining room: two Reverend Mothers and four acolytes. Teg recognized one of the Reverend Mothers: Darwi Odrade. He had seen her before only at a distance but the oval face and lovely eyes were arresting: so like Lucilla.\n“Do we have time for introductions?” Taraza asked.\n“Of course, Mother Superior.”\nTeg nodded and grasped the hand of each woman as Taraza presented them.\nAs they left, Teg turned to the uniformed stranger. “One must always observe the niceties,” Teg said. “Otherwise we are less than human.”\nNot until they were on the lighter, Taraza seated beside him and her entourage nearby, did Teg ask the overriding question.\n“How did they take you?”\nThe lighter was plunging planetward. The screen in front of Teg showed that the Ix-branded Guildship obeyed his command to remain in orbit until his party was safely behind its planetary defenses.\nBefore Taraza could respond, Odrade leaned across the aisle separating them and said: “I have countermanded the Bashar’s orders to destroy that Guildship, Mother.”\nTeg swiveled his head sharply and glared at Odrade. “But they took you captive and . . .” He scowled. “How did you know |—”\n“Miles!”\nTaraza’s voice conveyed overwhelming reproof. He grinned ruefully. Yes, she knew him almost as well as he knew himself... better in some respects.\n“They did not just capture us, Miles,” Taraza said. “We allowed ourselves to be taken. Ostensibly, | was escorting Dar to Rakis. We left our no-ship at Junction and asked for the fastest Guild Transport. All of my Council, including Burzmali, agreed that these intruders from the Scattering\nwould subvert the Transport and take us to you, aiming to pick up all the pieces of the ghola project.”\nTeg was aghast. The risk!\n“We knew you would rescue us,” Taraza said. “Burzmali was standing by in case you failed.”\n“That Guildship you’ve spared,” Teg said, “will summon assistance and attack our—”\n“They will not attack Gammu,” Taraza said. “Too many diverse forces from the Scattering are assembled on Gammu. They would not dare alienate so many.”\n“I wish | were as certain of that as you appear to be,” Teg said.\n“Be certain, Miles. Besides, there are other reasons for not destroying the Guildship. Ix and the Guild have been caught taking sides. That’s bad for business and they need all of the business they can get.”\n“Unless they have more important customers offering greater profits!”\n“Ahhhhh, Miles.” She spoke in a musing voice. “What we latter-day Bene Gesserit really do is try to let matters achieve a calmer tone, a balance. You know this.”\nTeg found this true but he locked on one phrase: “...latter- day...” The words conveyed a sense of Ssummation-at- death. Before he could question this, Taraza continued:\n“We like to settle the most passionate situations off the battlefield. | must admit we have the Tyr", " from the Scattering are assembled on Gammu. They would not dare alienate so many.”\n“I wish | were as certain of that as you appear to be,” Teg said.\n“Be certain, Miles. Besides, there are other reasons for not destroying the Guildship. Ix and the Guild have been caught taking sides. That’s bad for business and they need all of the business they can get.”\n“Unless they have more important customers offering greater profits!”\n“Ahhhhh, Miles.” She spoke in a musing voice. “What we latter-day Bene Gesserit really do is try to let matters achieve a calmer tone, a balance. You know this.”\nTeg found this true but he locked on one phrase: “...latter- day...” The words conveyed a sense of Ssummation-at- death. Before he could question this, Taraza continued:\n“We like to settle the most passionate situations off the battlefield. | must admit we have the Tyrant to thank for that attitude. | don’t suppose you’ve ever thought of yourself as a product of the Tyrant’s conditioning, Miles, but you are.”\nTeg accepted this without comment. It was a factor in the entire spread of human society. No Mentat could avoid it as a datum.\n“That quality in you, Miles, drew us to you in the first place,” Taraza said. “You can be damnably frustrating at times but we wouldn’t have you any other way.”\nBy subtle revelations in tone and manner, Teg realized that Taraza was not speaking solely for his benefit, but was\nalso directing her words at her entourage.\n“Have you any idea, Miles, how maddening it is to hear you argue both sides of an issue with equal force? But your Simpatico is a powerful weapon. How terrified some of our foes have been to find you confronting them where they had not the slightest suspicion you might appear!”\nTeg allowed himself a tight smile. He glanced at the women seated across the aisle from them. Why was Taraza directing such words at this group? Darwi Odrade appeared to be resting, head back, eyes closed. Several of the others were chatting among themselves. None of this was conclusive to Teg. Even Bene Gesserit acolytes could follow several trains of thought simultaneously. He returned his attention to Taraza.\n“You really feel things the way the enemy feels them,” Taraza said. “That is what | mean. And, of course, when you're in that mental frame there is no enemy for you.”\n“Yes, there is!”\n“Don’t mistake my words, Miles. We have never doubted your loyalty. But it’s uncanny how you make us see things we have no other way of seeing. There are times when you are Our eyes.”\nDarwi Odrade, Teg saw, had opened her eyes and was looking at him. She was a lovely woman. Something disturbing about her appearance. As with Lucilla, she reminded him of someone in his past. Before Teg could follow this thought, Taraza spoke.\n“Has the ghola this ability to balance between opposing forces?” she asked.\n“He could be a Mentat,” Teg said.\n“He was a Mentat in one incarnation, Miles.”\n“Do you really want him awakened so young?”\n“It is necessary, Miles. Deadly necessary.”\nThe failure of CHOAM? Quite simple: They ignore the fact that larger commercial powers wait at the edges of their activities, powers that could swallow them the way a slig swallows garbage. This is the true threat of the Scattering—to them and to us all.\n—BENE GESSERIT COUNCIL NOTES, ARCHIVES #SXX90CH\ndrade spared only part of her awareness to the conversation between Teg and Taraza. Their lighter was\na small one, its passenger quarters cramped. It would use atmospherics to dampen its descent, she knew, and she prepared herself for the buffeting. The pilot would be sparing of their suspensors on such a craft, saving energy.\nShe used these moments as she used all such time now to gird herself for the coming necessities. Time pressed; a special calendar drove her. She had looked at a calendar before leaving Chapter House, caught as often happened to her by the persistence of time and its language: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years... Standard Years, to be precise. Persistence was an inadequate word for the phenomenon. Inviolability was more like it. Tradition. Never disturb tradition. She held the comparisons firmly in mind, the ancient flow of time imposed on planets that did not tick to the primitive human clock. A week was seven days. Seven! How powerful that number remained. Mystical. It was enshrined in the Orange Catholic Bible. The Lord made a world in six days “and on the seventh day He rested.”\nGood for Him! Odrade thought. We all should rest after great labors.\nOdrade turned her head slightly and looked across the aisle at Teg. He had no idea how many memories of him she\npossessed. She could mark how the years had treated that strong face. Teaching the ghola had drained his energies, she saw. That child in the Gammu Keep must be a sponge absorbing anything and everything around him.\nMiles Teg, do you know how we use you? she wondered.\nIt was a thought that weakened her but she allowed it to persist in her awareness almost with a feeling of defiance. How easy it would be to love that old man! Not as a mate, of course... but love, nonetheless. She could feel the bond tugging at her and recognized it with the fine edge of her Bene Gesserit abilities. Love, damnable love, weakening love.\nOdrade had felt this tugging with the first mate she had been sent to seduce. Curious sensation. Her years of Bene Gesserit conditioning had made her wary of it. None of her proctors had allowed her the luxury of that unquestioning warmth, and she had learned in time the reasons behind such isolating care. But there she was, sent by the breeding mistresses, ordered to get that close to a single individual, to let him enter her. All of the clinical data lay there in her awareness and she could read the sexual excitement in her partner even as she allowed it in herself. She had, after all, been carefully prepared for this role by men the Breeding Mistresses selected and conditioned with exquisite nicety for just such training.\nOdrade sighed and looked away from Teg, closing her eyes in remembrance. Training Males never let their emotions reflect a bonding abandonment to their students. It was a necessary flaw in the sexual education.\nThat first seduction upon which she had been sent: She had been quite unprepared for the melting ecstasy of a simultaneous orgasm, a mutuality and sharing as old as humankind ... older! And with powers capable of overwhelming the reason. The look on her male companion’s face, the sweet kiss, his total abandonment of all self-protective reserves, unguarded and supremely\nvulnerable. No Training Male had ever done that! Desperately, she grasped for the Bene Gesserit lessons. Through those lessons, she saw the essence of this man on his face, felt that essence in her deepest fibers. For just an instant, she permitted an equal response, experiencing a new height of ecstasy that none of her teachers had hinted might be attainable. For that instant, she understood what had happened to the Lady Jessica and the other Bene Gesserit failures.\nThis feeling was love!\nIts power frightened her (as the Breeding Mistresses had known it would) and she fell back into the careful Bene Gesserit conditioning, allowing a mask of pleasure to take over the brief natural expression on her face, employing calculated caresses where natural caresses would have been easier (but less effective).\nThe male responded as expected, stupidly. It helped to think of him as stupid.\nHer second seduction had been easier. She could still call up the features of that first one, though, doing it sometimes with a calloused sense of wonder. Sometimes, his face came to her of itself and for no reason she could identify immediately.\nWith the other males she had been sent to breed, the memory markers were different. She had to hunt her past for the look of them. The sensory recordings of those experiences did not go as deep. Not so with that first one!\nSuch was the dangerous power of love.\nAnd look at the troubles this hidden force had caused the Bene Gesserit over the millennia. The Lady Jessica and her love for her Duke had been only one example among countless others. Love clouded reason. It diverted the Sisters from their duties. Love could be tolerated only where it caused no immediate and obvious disruptions or where it served the larger purposes of the Bene Gesserit. Otherwise it was to be avoided.\nAlways, though, it remained an object of disquieting watchfulness.\nOdrade opened her eyes and glanced again at Teg and Taraza. The Mother Superior had taken up a new subject. How irritating Taraza’s voice could be at times! Odrade closed her eyes and listened to the conversation, tied to those two voices by some link in her awareness that she could not avoid.\n“Very few people realize how much of the infrastructure in a civilization is dependency infrastructure,” Taraza said. “We have made quite a study of this.”\nLove is a dependency infrastructure, Odrade thought. Why had Taraza hit on this subject at this time? The Mother Superior seldom did anything without deep motives. “Dependency infrastructure is a term that includes all things necessary for a human population to survive at existing or increased numbers,” Taraza said.\n“Melange?” Teg asked.\n“Of course, but most people look at the spice and say, ‘How nice it is that we can have it and it can give us so much longer lives than were enjoyed by our ancestors.’”\n“Providing they can afford it.” Teg’s voice had a bite in it, Odrade noted.\n“As long as no single power controls all of the market, most people have enough,” Taraza said.\n“| learned economics at my mother’s knee,” Teg said. “Food, water, breathable air, living space not contaminated by poisons—there are many kinds of money and the value changes according to the dependency.”\nAs she listened to him, Odrade almost nodded in agreement. His response was her own. Don’t belabor the obvious, Taraza! Get to your point.\n“I want you to remember your mother’s teachings very clearly,” Taraza said. How mild her voice was suddenly! Taraza’s voice changed abruptly then and she snapped: “Hydraulic despotism!”\nShe does that shift of emphasis well, Odrade thought. Memory spewed up the data like a spigot suddenly opened full force. Hydraulic despotism: central control of an essential energy such as water, electricity, fuel, medicines, melange... Obey the central controlling power or the energy is shut off and you die!\nTaraza was talking once more: “There’s another useful concept that I’m sure your mother taught you—the key log.”\nOdrade was very curious now. Taraza was headed somewhere important with this conversation. Key log: a truly ancient concept from the days before suspensors when lumbermen sent their fallen timber rushing down rivers to central mill sites. Sometimes the logs jammed up in the river and an expert was brought in to find the one log, the key log, which would free the jam when removed. Teg, she knew, would have an intellectual understanding of the term but she and Taraza could call up actual witnesses from Other Memories, see the explosion of broken bits of wood and water as a jam was released.\n“The Tyrant was a key log,” Taraza said. “He created the jam and he released it.”\nThe lighter began trembling sharply as it took its first bite of Gammu’s atmosphere. Odrade felt the tight"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_5d8aff1e492ef081cc575267e4ee2bccb525aa6991e2f30a33eb1379fdd3ac0d_v2"}
