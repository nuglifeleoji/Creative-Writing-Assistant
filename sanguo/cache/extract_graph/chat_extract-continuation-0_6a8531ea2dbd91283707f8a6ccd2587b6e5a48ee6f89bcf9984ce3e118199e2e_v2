�把荆州交还东吴。”肃曰：“西川迢递，取之非易。都督此计，莫非不可？”瑜笑曰：“子敬真长者也。你道我真个去取西川与他？我只以此为名，实欲去取荆州，且教他不做准备。东吴军马收川，路过荆州，就问他索要钱粮，刘备必然出城劳军。那时乘势杀之，夺取荆州，雪吾之恨，解足下之祸。”\n\n    鲁肃大喜，便再往荆州来。玄德与孔明商议。孔明曰：“鲁肃必不曾见吴侯，只到柴桑和周瑜商量了甚计策，来诱我耳。但说的话，主公只看我点头，便满口应承。”计会已定。鲁肃入见。礼毕，曰：“吴侯甚是称赞皇叔盛德，遂与诸将商议，起兵替皇叔收川。取了西川，却换荆州，以西川权当嫁资。但军马经过，却望应些钱粮。”孔明听了，忙点头曰：“难得吴侯好心！”玄德拱手称谢曰：“此皆子敬善言之力。”孔明曰：“如雄师到日，即当远接犒劳。”鲁肃暗喜，宴罢辞回。\n\n    玄德问孔明曰：“此是何意？”孔明大笑曰：“周瑜死日近矣！这等计策，小儿也瞒不过！”玄德又问如何，孔明曰：“此乃假途灭虢之计也。虚名牧川，实取荆州。等主公出城劳军，乘势拿下，杀入城来，攻其不备，出其不意也。”玄德曰：“如之奈何？”孔明曰：“主公宽心，只顾准备窝弓以擒猛虎，安排香饵以钓鳌鱼。等周瑜到来，他便不死，也九分无气。”便唤赵云听计：“如此如此，其余我自有摆布。”玄德大喜。后人有诗云：“周瑜决策取荆州，诸葛先知第一筹。指望长江香饵稳，不知暗里钓鱼钩。”\n\n    却说鲁肃回见周瑜，说玄德、孔明欢喜一节，准备出城劳军。周瑜大笑曰：“原来今番也中了吾计！”便教鲁肃禀报吴侯，并遣程普引军接应。周瑜此时箭疮已渐平愈，身躯无事，使甘宁为先锋，自与徐盛、丁奉为第二，凌统、吕蒙为后队，水陆大兵五万，望荆州而来。周瑜在船中，时复欢笑，以为孔明中计。前军至夏口，周瑜问：“荆州有人在前面接否！”人报：“刘皇叔使糜竺来见都督。”瑜唤至，问劳军如何。糜竺曰：“主公皆准备安排下了。”瑜曰：“皇叔何在？”竺曰：“在荆州城门外相等，与都督把盏。”瑜曰：“今为汝家之事，出兵远征；劳军之礼，休得轻易。”糜竺领了言语先回。\n\n
