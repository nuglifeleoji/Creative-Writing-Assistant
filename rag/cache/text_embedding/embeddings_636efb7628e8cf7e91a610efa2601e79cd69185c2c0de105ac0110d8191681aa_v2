robe up around his nose, leaving only the dark eyes and a thin patch of forehead exposed. The veil bulged with the outline of a stillsuit’s catchtube. This told Alia that they’d come in from the desert. Where did they hide out there?\nThe Preacher wore no veil protection from the searing air. He had even dropped the catchtube flap of his stillsuit. His face lay open to the sunlight and the heat shiverings which lifted off the square’s paving blocks in visible waves.\nAt the Temple steps there stood a group of nine pilgrims making their departure obeisance. The shadowed edge of the square held perhaps fifty more persons, mostly pilgrims devoting themselves to various penances imposed by the priesthood. Among the onlookers could be seen messengers and a few merchants who’d not yet made enough sales to close up for the worst of the day’s heat.\nx x x\nVA aching from the open slit, Alia felt the drenching heat and knew herself to be caught between thinking and sensation, the way she’d often seen her brother caught. The\ntemptation to consult within herself rang like an ominous humming in her head. The Baron was there: dutiful, but always ready to play upon her terrors when rational judgment failed and the things around her lost their sense of past, present, and future.\nWhat if that’s Paul down there? she asked herself.\n“Nonsense!” the voice within her said.\nBut the reports of The Preacher’s words could not be doubted. Heresy! It terrified her to think that Paul himself might bring down the structure built on his name.\nWhy not?\nShe thought of what she’d said in Council just that morning, turning viciously upon Irulan, who’d urged acceptance of the gift of clothing from House Corrino.\n“All gifts to the twins will be examined thoroughly, just as always,” Irulan had argued.\n“And when we find the gift harmless?” Alia had cried.\nSomehow that had been the most frightening thing of all: to find that the gift carried no threat.\nIn the end they’d accepted the fine clothing and had gone on to the other issue: Was the Lady Jessica to be given a position on the Council? Alia had managed to delay a vote.\nShe thought of this as she stared down at The Preacher.\nThings which happened to her Regency now were like the underside of that transformation they inflicted upon this planet. Dune had once symbolized the power of ultimate desert. That power dwindled physically, but the myth of its power grew apace. Only the ocean-desert remained, the great Mother Desert of the inner planet, with its rim of thorn bushes, which Fremen still called Queen of Night. Behind the thorn bushes arose soft green hills bending down to the sand. All the hills were man-made. Every last one of them had been planted by men who had labored like crawling insects. The green of those hills was almost overpowering to someone raised, as Alia had been, in the tradition of dun- shaded sand. In her mind, as in the minds of all Fremen, the\nocean-desert still held Dune in a grip which would never relax. She had only to close her eyes and she would see that desert.\nOpen eyes at the desert edge saw now the verdant hills, marsh slime reaching out green pseudopods toward the sand—but the other desert remained as powerful as ever.\nAlia shook her head, stared down at The Preacher.\nHe had mounted the first of the terraced steps below the Temple and turned to face the almost deserted square. Alia touched the button beside her window which would amplify voices from below. She felt a wave of self-pity, seeing herself held here in loneliness. Whom could she trust? She’d thought Stilgar remained reliable, but Stilgar had been infected by this blind man.\n“You know how he counts?” Stilgar had asked her. “l heard him counting coins as he paid his guide. It’s very strange to my Fremen ears, and that’s a terrible thing. He counts ’shuc, ishcai, gimsa, chuascu, picha, sucta, and so on. I’ve not heard counting like that since the old days in the desert.”\nFrom this, Alia knew that Stilgar could not be sent to do the job which must be done. And she would have to be circumspect with her guards where the slightest emphasis from the Regency tended to be taken as absolute command.\nWhat was he doing down there, this Preacher?\nThe surrounding marketplace beneath its protective balconies and arched arcade still presented a gaudy face: merchandise left on display with a few boys to watch over it. Some few merchants remained awake there sniffing for the spice-biscuit money of the back country or the jingle in a pilgrim’s purse.\nAlia studied The Preacher’s back. He appeared poised for speech, but something withheld his voice.\nWhy do I stand here watching that ruin in ancient flesh? she asked herself. That mortal wreckage down there cannot be the “vessel of magnificence” which once was my brother.\nFrustration bordering on anger filled her. How could she find out about The Preacher, find out for certain without finding out? She was trapped. She dared not reveal more than a passing curiosity about this heretic.\nlrulan felt it. She’d lost her famous Bene Gesserit poise and screamed in Council: “We've lost the power to think well of ourselves!”\nEven Stilgar had been shocked.\nJavid had brought them back to their senses: “We don’t have time for such nonsense!”\nJavid was right. What did it matter how they thought of themselves? All that concerned them was holding onto the Imperial power.\nBut Irulan, recovering her poise, had been even more devastating: “We’ve lost something vital, | tell you. When we lost it, we lost the ability to make good decisions. We fall upon decisions these days the way we fall upon an enemy— or wait and wait, which is a form of giving up, and we allow the decisions of others to move us. Have we forgotten that we were the ones who set this current flowing?”\nAnd all over the question of whether to accept a gift from House Corrino.\nlrulan will have to be disposed of, Alia decided.\nWhat was that old man down there waiting for? He called himself a preacher. Why didn’t he preach?\nlrulan was wrong about our decision-making, Alia told herself. / can still make proper decisions! The person with life-and-death decisions to make must make decisions or remain caught in the pendulum. Paul had always said that stasis was the most dangerous of those things which were not natural. The only permanence was fluid. Change was all that mattered.\nlIl show them change! Alia thought.\nThe Preacher raised his arms in benediction.\nA few of those remaining in the square moved closer to him, and Alia noted the slowness of that movement. Yes, the\nrumors were out that The Preacher had aroused Alia’s displeasure. She bent closer to the Ixian speaker beside her spy hole. The speaker brought her the murmurings of the people in the square, the sound of wind, the scratching of feet on sand.\n“I bring you four messages!” The Preacher said.\nHis voice blared from Alia’s speaker, and she turned down the volume.\n“Each message is for a certain person,” The Preacher said. “The first message is for Alia, the suzerain of this place.” He pointed behind him toward her spy hole. “I bring her a warning: You, who held the secret of duration in your loins, have sold your future for an empty purse!”\nHow dare he? Alia thought. But his words froze her.\n“My second message,” The Preacher said, “is for Stilgar, the Fremen Naib, who believes he can translate the power of the tribes into the power of the Imperium. My warning to you, Stilgar: The most dangerous of all creations is a rigid code of ethics. It will turn upon you and drive you into exile!”\nHe has gone too far! Alia thought. / must send the guards for him no matter the consequences. But her hands remained at her sides.\nThe Preacher turned to face the Temple, climbed to the second step and once more whirled to face the square, all the time keeping his left hand upon the shoulder of his guide. He called out now: “My third message is for the Princess Irulan. Princess! Humiliation is a thing which no person can forget. | warn you to flee!”\nWhat’s he saying? Alia asked herself. We humiliated Irulan, but... Why does he warn her to flee? My decision was just made! A thrill of fear shot through Alia. How did The Preacher know?\n“My fourth message is for Duncan Idaho,” he shouted. “Duncan! You were taught to believe that loyalty buys loyalty. Ohh, Duncan, do not believe in history, because\nhistory is impelled by whatever passes for money. Duncan! Take your horns and do what you know best how to do.”\nAlia chewed the back of her right hand. Horns! She wanted to reach out and press the button which would Summon guards, but her hand refused to move.\n“Now | will preach to you,” The Preacher said. “This is a sermon of the desert. | direct it to the ears of Muad’Dib’s priesthood, those who practice the ecumenism of the sword. Ohhh, you believers in manifest destiny! Know you not that manifest destiny has its demoniac side? You cry out that you find yourselves exalted merely to have lived in the blessed generations of Muad’Dib. | say to you that you have abandoned Muad’Dib. Holiness has replaced love in your religion! You court the vengeance of the desert!”\nThe Preacher lowered his head as though in prayer.\nAlia felt herself shivering with awareness. Gods below! That voice! It had been cracked by years in the burning sands, but it could be the remnant of Paul’s voice.\nOnce more The Preacher raised his head. His voice boomed out over the square where more people had begun to gather, attracted by this oddity out of the past.\n“Thus it is written!” The Preacher shouted. “They who pray for dew at the desert’s edge shall bring forth the deluge! They shall not escape their fate through powers of reason! Reason arises from pride that a man may not know in this way when he has done evil.” He lowered his voice. “It was said of Muad’Dib that he died of prescience, that knowledge of the future killed him and he passed from the universe of reality into the alam al-mythal. | say to you that this is the illusion of Maya. Such thoughts have no independent reality. They cannot go out from you and do real things. Muad’Dib said of himself that he possessed no Rihani magic with which to encipher the universe. Do not doubt him.”\nAgain The Preacher raised his arms, lifted his voice in a stentorian bellow: “I warn the priesthood of Muad’Dib! The\nfire on the cliff shall burn you! They who learn the lesson of self-deception too well shall perish by that deception. The blood of a brother cannot be cleansed away!”\nHe had lowered his arms, found his young guide, and was leaving the square before Alia could break herself from the trembling immobility which had overcome her. Such fearless heresy! It must be Paul. She had to warn her guards. They dared not move against this Preacher openly. The evidence in the square below her confirmed this.\nDespite the heresy, no one moved", " the illusion of Maya. Such thoughts have no independent reality. They cannot go out from you and do real things. Muad’Dib said of himself that he possessed no Rihani magic with which to encipher the universe. Do not doubt him.”\nAgain The Preacher raised his arms, lifted his voice in a stentorian bellow: “I warn the priesthood of Muad’Dib! The\nfire on the cliff shall burn you! They who learn the lesson of self-deception too well shall perish by that deception. The blood of a brother cannot be cleansed away!”\nHe had lowered his arms, found his young guide, and was leaving the square before Alia could break herself from the trembling immobility which had overcome her. Such fearless heresy! It must be Paul. She had to warn her guards. They dared not move against this Preacher openly. The evidence in the square below her confirmed this.\nDespite the heresy, no one moved to stop the departing Preacher. No Temple guard leaped to pursue him. No pilgrim tried to stop him. That charismatic blind man! Everyone who Saw or heard him felt his power, the reflection of divine talent.\nIn spite of the day’s heat, Alia felt suddenly cold. She felt the thin edge of her grip on the Imperium as a physical thing. She gripped the edge of her spy hole window as though to hold her power, thinking of its fragility. The balance of Landsraad, CHOAM, and Fremen arms held the core of power, while Spacing Guild and Bene Gesserit dealt silently in the shadows. The forbidden seepage of technological development which came from the edges of humankind’s farthest migrations nibbled at the central power. Products permitted the Ixian and Tleilaxu factories could not relieve the pressure. And always in the wings there stood Farad’n of House Corrino, inheritor of Shaddam IV’s titles and claims.\nWithout the Fremen, without House Atreides’ monopoly on the geriatric spice, her grip would loosen. All the power would dissolve. She could feel it slipping from her right now. People heeded this Preacher. It would be dangerous to silence him; just as dangerous as it was to let him continue preaching such words as he’d shouted across her square today. She could see the first omens of her own defeat and the pattern of the problem stood out clearly in her mind. The Bene Gesserits had codified the problem:\n“A large populace held in check by a small but powerful force is quite a common situation in our universe. And we know the major conditions wherein this large populace may turn upon its keepers—\n“One: When they find a leader. This is the most volatile threat to the powerful; they must retain control of leaders.\n“Two: When the populace recognizes its chains. Keep the populace blind and unquestioning.\n“Three: When the populace perceives a hope of escape from bondage. They must never even believe that escape is possible!”\nAlia shook her head, feeling her cheeks tremble with the force of movement. The signs were here in her populace. Every report she received from her spies throughout the Imperium reinforced her certain knowledge. Unceasing warfare of the Fremen Jihad left its mark everywhere. Wherever “the ecumenism of the sword” had touched, people retained the attitude of a subject population: defensive, concealing, evasive. All manifestations of authority—and this meant essentially re/igious authority— became subject to resentment. Oh, pilgrims still came in their thronging millions, and some among them were probably devout. But for the most part, pilgrimage had other motivations than devotion. Most often it was a canny surety for the future. It emphasized obedience and gained a real form of power which was easily translated into wealth. The Hajji who returned from Arrakis came home to new authority, new social status. The Hajji could make profitable economic decisions which the planet-bound of his homeworld dared not challenge.\nAlia knew the popular riddle: “What do you see inside the empty purse brought home from Dune?” And the answer: “The eyes of Muad’Dib (fire diamonds).”\nThe traditional ways to counter growing unrest paraded themselves before Alia’s awareness: people had to be taught that opposition was always punished and assistance\nto the ruler was always rewarded. Imperial forces must be shifted in random fashion. Major adjuncts to Imperial power had to be concealed. Every movement by which the Regency countered potential attack required delicate timing to keep the opposition off balance.\nHave I lost my sense of timing? she wondered.\n“What idle speculation is this?” a voice within her asked. She felt herself growing calmer. Yes, the Baron’s plan was a good one. We eliminate the threat of the Lady Jessica and, at the same time, we discredit House Corrino. Yes.\nThe Preacher could be dealt with later. She understood his posture. The symbolism was clear. He was the ancient spirit of unbridled speculation, the spirit of heresy alive and functioning in her desert of orthodoxy. That was his strength. It didn’t matter whether he was Paul... as long as that could be kept in doubt. But her Bene Gesserit knowledge told Alia that his strength would contain the key to his weakness.\nThe Preacher has a flaw which we will find. | will have him spied upon, watched every moment. And if the opportunity arises, he will be discredited.\n| will not argue with the Fremen claims that they are divinely inspired to transmit a religious revelation. It is their concurrent claim to ideological revelation which inspires me to shower them with derision. Of course, they make the dual claim in the hope that it will strengthen their mandarinate and help them to endure in a universe which finds them increasingly oppressive. It is in the name of all those oppressed people that | warn the Fremen: short-term expediency always fails in the long term.\n—THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN\neto had come up in the night with Stilgar to the narrow\nledge at the crest of the low rock outcropping which Sietch Tabr called The Attendant. Under the waning light of Second Moon, the ledge gave them a panoramic view—the Shield Wall with Mount Idaho to the north, the Great Flat to the south and rolling dunes eastward toward Habbanya Ridge. Winding dust, the aftermath of a storm, hid the southern horizon. Moonlight frosted the rim of the Shield Wall.\nStilgar had come against his will, joining the secretive venture finally because Leto aroused his curiosity. Why was it necessary to risk a sand crossing in the night? The lad had threatened to sneak away and make the journey alone if Stilgar refused. The way of it bothered him profoundly, though. Two such important targets alone in the night!\nLeto squatted on the ledge facing south toward the flat. Occasionally he pounded his knee as though in frustration.\nStilgar waited. He was good at silent waiting, and stood two paces to one side of his charge, arms folded, his robe moving softly in the night breeze.\nFor Leto, the sand crossing represented a response to inner desperation, a need to seek a new alignment for his life in a silent conflict which Ghanima could no longer risk.\nHe had maneuvered Stilgar into sharing the journey because there were things Stilgar had to know in preparation for the days ahead.\nAgain Leto pounded his knee. It was difficult to know a beginning! He felt, at times, like an extension of those countless other lives, all as real and immediate as his own. In the flow of those lives there was no ending, no accomplishment—only eternal beginning. They could be a mob, too, clamoring at him as though he were a single window through which each desired to peer. And there lay the peril which had destroyed Alia.\nLeto stared outward at the moonlight silvering the storm remnants. Folds and overfolds of dunes spread across the flat: silica grit measured out by the winds, mounded into waves—pea sand, grit sand, pebbles. He felt himself caught in one of those poised moments just before dawn. Time pressed at him. It was already the month of Akkad and behind him lay the last of an interminable waiting time: long hot days and hot dry winds, nights like this one tormented by gusts and endless blowings from the furnace lands of the Hawkbled. He glanced over his shoulder toward the Shield Wall, a broken line in starlight. Beyond that wall in the Northern Sink lay the focus of his problems.\nOnce more he looked to the desert. As he stared into the hot darkness, day dawned, the sun rising out of dust scarves and placing a touch of lime into the storm’s red streamers. He closed his eyes, willing himself to see how this day would appear from Arrakeen, and the city lay there in his consciousness, caught up like a scattering of boxes between the light and the new shadows. Desert... boxes . .. desert . . . boxes...\nWhen he opened his eyes, the desert remained: a spreading curry expanse of wind-kicked sand. Oily shadows along the base of each dune reached out like rays of the night just past. They linked one time with the other. He thought of the night, squatting here with Stilgar restless\nbeside him, the older man worried at the silence and the unexplained reasons for coming to this place. Stilgar must have many memories of passing this way with his beloved Muad’Dib. Even now Stilgar was moving, scanning all around, alert for dangers. Stilgar did not like the open in daylight. He was pure old Fremen in that.\nLeto’s mind was reluctant to leave the night and the clean exertions of a sand crossing. Once here in the rocks, the night had taken on its black stillness. He sympathized with Stilgar’s daylight fears. Black was a single thing even when it contained boiling terrors. Light could be many things. Night held its fear smells and its things which came with slithering sounds. Dimensions separated in the night, everything amplified—thorns sharper, blades more cutting. But terrors of the day could be worse.\nStilgar cleared his throat.\nLeto spoke without turning: “I have a very serious problem, Stil.”\n“So | surmised.” The voice beside Leto came low and wary. The child had sounded disturbingly of the father. It was a thing of forbidden magic which touched a cord of revulsion in Stilgar. Fremen knew the terrors of possession. Those found possessed were rightfully killed and their water cast upon the sand lest it contaminate the tribal cistern. The dead should remain dead. It was correct to find one’s immortality in children, but children had no right to assume too exact a shape from their past.\n“My problem is that my father left so many things undone,” Leto said. “Especially the focus of our lives. The Empire cannot go on this way, Stil, without a proper focus for human life. | am speaking of life, you understand? Life, not death.”\n“Once, when he was troubled by a vision, your father spoke in this vein to me,” Stilgar said.\nLeto found himself tempted to pass off that questioning fear beside him with a light response, perhaps a suggestion\nthat they break their fast. He realized that he was very hungry. They had eaten the previous noon and Leto had insisted on fasting through the night. But another hunger drew him now.\nThe trouble with my life is the trouble with this place, Leto thought. No preliminary creation. | just go back and back and back until distances fade away. | cannot see the horizon; | cannot see Habbanya Ridge. | can’t find the original place of testing.\n“There’s really no substitute for prescience,” Leto said. “Perhaps |", "Especially the focus of our lives. The Empire cannot go on this way, Stil, without a proper focus for human life. | am speaking of life, you understand? Life, not death.”\n“Once, when he was troubled by a vision, your father spoke in this vein to me,” Stilgar said.\nLeto found himself tempted to pass off that questioning fear beside him with a light response, perhaps a suggestion\nthat they break their fast. He realized that he was very hungry. They had eaten the previous noon and Leto had insisted on fasting through the night. But another hunger drew him now.\nThe trouble with my life is the trouble with this place, Leto thought. No preliminary creation. | just go back and back and back until distances fade away. | cannot see the horizon; | cannot see Habbanya Ridge. | can’t find the original place of testing.\n“There’s really no substitute for prescience,” Leto said. “Perhaps | should risk the spice...”\n“And be destroyed as your father was?”\n“A dilemma,” Leto said.\n“Once your father confided in me that knowing the future too well was to be locked into that future to the exclusion of any freedom to change.”\n“The paradox which is our problem,” Leto said. “It’s a subtle and powerful thing, prescience. The future becomes now. To be sighted in the land of the blind carries its own perils. If you try to interpret what you see for the blind, you tend to forget that the blind possess an inherent movement conditioned by their blindness. They are like a monstrous machine moving along its own path. They have their own momentum, their own fixations. | fear the blind, Stil. | fear them. They can so easily crush anything in their path.”\nStilgar stared at the desert. Lime dawn had become steel day. He said: “Why have we come to this place?”\n“Because | wanted you to see the place where | may die.”\nStilgar tensed. Then: “So you have had a vision!”\n“Perhaps it was only a dream.”\n“Why do we come to such a dangerous place?” Stilgar glared down at his charge. “We will return at once.”\n“|I won't die today, Stil.”\n“No? What was this vision?”\n“| saw three paths,” Leto said. His voice came out with the sleepy sound of remembrance. “One of those futures\nrequires me to kill our grandmother.”\nStilgar shot a sharp glance back toward Sietch Tabr, as though he feared the Lady Jessica could hear them across the sandy distance. “Why?”\n“To keep from losing the spice monopoly.”\n“| don’t understand.”\n“Nor do I. But that is the thought of my dream when I use the knife.”\n“Oh.” Stilgar understood the use of a knife. He drew a deep breath. “What is the second path?”\n“Ghani and | marry to seal the Atreides bloodline.”\n“Ghaaa!” Stilgar expelled his breath in a violent expression of distaste.\n“It was uSual in ancient times for kings and queens to do this,” Leto said. “Ghani and | have decided we will not breed.”\n“I warn you to hold fast in that decision!” There was death in Stilgar’s voice. By Fremen Law, incest was punishable by death on the hanging tripod. He cleared his throat, asked: “And the third path?”\n“I am called to reduce my father to human stature.”\n“He was my friend, Muad’Dib,” Stilgar muttered.\n“He was your god! | must undeify him.”\nStilgar turned his back on the desert, stared toward the oasis of his beloved Sietch Tabr. Such talk always disturbed him.\nLeto sensed the sweaty smell of Stilgar’s movement. It was such a temptation to avoid the purposeful things which had to be said here. They could talk half the day away, moving from the specific to the abstract as though drawn away from real decisions, from those immediate necessities which confronted them. And there was no doubt that House Corrino posed a real threat to real lives—his own and Ghani’s. But everything he did now had to be weighed and tested against the secret necessities. Stilgar once had voted to have Farad’n assassinated, holding out for the subtle\napplication of chaumurky: poison administered in a drink. Farad’n was known to be partial to certain sweet liquors. That could not be permitted.\n“If | die here, Stil,” Leto said, “you must beware of Alia. She is no longer your friend.”\n“What is this talk of death and your aunt?” Now Stilgar was truly outraged. Kill the Lady Jessica! Beware of Alia! Die in this place!\n“Small men change their faces at her command,” Leto said. “A ruler need not be a prophet, Stil. Nor even godlike. A ruler need only be sensitive. | brought you here with me to clarify what our Imperium requires. It requires good government. That does not depend upon laws or precedent, but upon the personal qualities of whoever governs.”\n“The Regency handles its Imperial duties quite well,” Stilgar said. “When you come of age—”\n“I am of age! I’m the oldest person here! You’re a puling infant beside me. | can remember times more than fifty centuries past. Hah! | can even remember when we Fremen were on Thurgrod.”\n“Why do you play with such fancies?” Stilgar demanded, his tone peremptory.\nLeto nodded to himself. Why indeed? Why recount his memories of those other centuries? Today’s Fremen were his immediate problem, most of them still only half-tamed savages, prone to laugh at unlucky innocence.\n“The crysknife dissolves at the death of its owner,” Leto said. “Muad’Dib has dissolved. Why are the Fremen still alive?”\nIt was one of those abrupt thought changes which so confounded Stilgar. He found himself temporarily dumb. Such words contained meaning, but their intent eluded him.\n“lam expected to be Emperor, but | must be the servant,” Leto said. He glanced across his shoulder at Stilgar. “My grandfather for whom | was named added new\nwords to his coat of arms when he came here to Dune: ‘Here | am; here | remain.’”\n“He had no choice,” Stilgar said.\n“Very good, Stil. Nor have | any choice. | should be the Emperor by birth, by the fitness of my understanding, by all that has gone into me. | even know what the Imperium requires: good government.”\n“Naib has an ancient meaning,” Stilgar said. “It is ‘servant of the Sietch.’”\n“I remember your training, Stil,” Leto said. “For proper government, the tribe must have ways to choose men whose lives reflect the way a government should behave.”\nFrom the depths of his Fremen soul, Stilgar said: “You'll assume the Imperial Mantle if it’s meet. First you must prove that you can behave in the fashion of a ruler!”\nUnexpectedly, Leto laughed. Then: “Do you doubt my sincerity, Stil?”\n“Of course not.”\n“My birthright?”\n“You are who you are.”\n“And if | do what is expected of me, that is the measure of my sincerity, eh?”\n“It is the Fremen practice.”\n“Then | cannot have inner feelings to guide my behavior?”\n“| don’t understand what—”\n“If | always behave with propriety, no matter what it costs me to suppress my own desires, then that is the measure of me.”\n“Such is the essence of self-control, youngster.”\n“Youngster!” Leto shook his head. “Ahhh, Stil, you provide me with the key to a rational ethic of government. | must be constant, every action rooted in the traditions of the past.”\n“That is proper.”\n“But my past goes deeper than yours!”\n“What difference—”\n“I have no first person singular, Stil. | am a multiple person with memories of traditions more ancient than you could imagine. That’s my burden, Stil. I’m past- directed. I’m abrim with innate knowledge which resists newness and change. Yet Muad’Dib changed all this.” He gestured at the desert, his arm sweeping to encompass the Shield Wall behind him.\nStilgar turned to peer at the Shield Wall. A village had been built beneath the wall since Muad’Dib’s time, houses to shelter a planetology crew helping spread plant life into the desert. Stilgar stared at the man-made intrusion into the landscape. Change? Yes: There was an alignment to the village, a trueness which offended him. He stood silently, ignoring the itching of grit particles under his stillsuit. That village was an offense against the thing this planet had been. Suddenly Stilgar wanted a circular howling of wind to leap over the dunes and obliterate that place. The sensation left him trembling.\nLeto said: “Have you noticed, Stil, that the new stillsuits are of sloppy manufacture? Our water loss is too high.”\nStilgar stopped himself on the point of asking: Have / not said it? Instead he said: “Our people grow increasingly dependent upon the pills.”\nLeto nodded. The pills shifted body temperature, reduced water loss. They were cheaper and easier than stillsuits. But they inflicted the user with other burdens, among them a tendency to slowed reaction time, occasional blurred vision.\n“Is that why we came out here?” Stilgar asked. “To discuss stillsuit manufacture?”\n“Why not?” Leto asked. “Since you will not face what | must talk about.”\n“Why must | beware of your aunt?” Anger edged his voice.\n“Because she plays upon the old Fremen desire to resist change, yet would bring more terrible change than you can imagine.”\n“You make much out of little! She’s a proper Fremen.”\n“Ahhh, then the proper Fremen holds to the ways of the past and | have an ancient past. Stil, were I to give free reign to this inclination, | would demand a closed society, completely dependent upon the sacred ways of the past. | would control migration, explaining that this fosters new ideas, and new ideas are a threat to the entire structure of life. Each little planetary polis would go its own way, becoming what it would. Finally the Empire would shatter under the weight of its differences.”\nStilgar tried to swallow in a dry throat. These were words which Muad’Dib might have produced. They had his ring to them. They were paradox, frightening. But if one allowed any change... He shook his head.\n“The past may show the right way to behave if you live in the past, Stil, but circumstances change.”\nStilgar could only agree that circumstances did change. How must one behave then? He looked beyond Leto, seeing the desert and not seeing it. Muad’Dib had walked there. The flat was a place of golden shadows as the sun climbed, purple shadows, gritty rivulets crested in dust vapors. The dust fog which usually hung over Habbanya Ridge was visible in the far distance now, and the desert between presented his eyes with dunes diminishing, one curve into another. Through the smoky shimmer of heat he saw the plants which crept out from the desert edge. Muad’Dib had caused life to sprout in that desolate place. Copper, gold, red flowers, yellow flowers, rust and russet, grey-green leaves, spikes and harsh shadows beneath bushes. The motion of the day’s heat set shadows quivering, vibrating in the air.\nPresently Stilgar said: “I am only a leader of Fremen;"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_636efb7628e8cf7e91a610efa2601e79cd69185c2c0de105ac0110d8191681aa_v2"}
