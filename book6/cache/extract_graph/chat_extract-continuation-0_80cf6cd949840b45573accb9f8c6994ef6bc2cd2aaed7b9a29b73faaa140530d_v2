存在，能爱就很幸运了。”\n　　这就是罗辑最投入的一次爱情经历，而这种爱一个男人一生只有一次的。以后，罗辑又开始了他那漫不经心的生活，就像他们一同出行时开着的稚阁车，走到哪儿算哪儿。正如那个心理医生所说，她对他的生活的影响越来越小了，当他与一个真实的女性在一起时，她就不会出现。到后来，即使他独处，她也很少出现了。但罗辑知道，自己心灵中最僻静的疆土已经属于她了，她将在那里伴随他一生。他甚至能清晰地看到她所在的世界，那是一片宁静的雪原，那里的天空永远有银色的星星和弯月。但霄也在不停地下着，雪原像白砂糖般洁白平润，静得仿佛能听到雪花落在上面的声音。她就在雪原上一间精致的小木屋中，这个罗辑用自己思想的肋骨造出的夏娃，坐在古老的壁炉前，静静地看着跳动的火焰。\n　　现在，在这凶险莫测的航程中，孤独的罗辑想让她来陪伴，想和她一起猜测航程的尽头有什么，但她没有出现。在心灵的远方，罗辑看到她仍静静地坐在壁炉前，她不会感到寂寞，因为知道自已的世界坐落于何处。\n　　罗辑伸手去章床头的药瓶，想吃一片安眠药强迫自己入睡，就在他的手指接触药瓶前的一刹那，药瓶从床头柜上飞了起来，同时飞起来的还有罗辑扔在椅子上的衣服，它们直上天花板，在那里待了两秒钟后又落了下来。罗辑感到自己的身体也离开了床面，但由于睡袋的固定投有飞起来。在药瓶和衣服落下后，罗辑也感到自己重重地落回床面，有那么几秒钟，他的身体感觉被重物所压，动弹不得。这突然的失重和超重令他头晕目眩，但这现象持续了不到十秒钟，很快一切恢复正常。\n　　罗辑听到了门外脚步踏在地毡上的沙沙声，有好几个人在走动，门开了，史强探进头来：“罗辑，没事吧？”听到罗辑回答没事，他就没有进来，把门关上了，罗辑听到了门外低低的对话声。\n　　“好像是护航交接时出的一点误会，没什么事的。”\n　　“刚才上级来电话又说了什么？”这是史强的声音。\n　　“说是一个半小时后护航编队要空中加油，让我们不要惊慌。”\n　　“计划上没提这茬儿啊，”\n　　“嗨，别提了，就刚才乱那一下子，有七架护航机把副油箱抛了（1）。”\n　　①歼击机在进入空中格斗状态时，要抛弃副油箱减轻重量。\n　　“干吗这么一惊一咋的？算了，你们去睡一会儿吧，别弄得太紧张。”\n　　“现在这状态，哪能睡呀！”\n######################\nOutput:",
