\n　　几天以来，孙少安被各种情况刺激得坐卧不安，同时也在内心升腾一种新的雄心壮志。他感到，由于过去太穷，生活一旦有所改善，就有点心满意足了。现在看来，他应该放开手脚发展自己的事业。他要成为一个真正的“冒尖户”。他暗暗下决心，明年他要理直气壮地来参加这样的会议！ \n　　在别的“冒尖户”们外出逛悠的时候，孙少安就一个人躲在房间里，开始谋算他下一步的宏图远景。他想回去以后，先立刻筹划买一台中型３００型制砖机，多开几个烧砖窑，办它个真正的砖厂！ \n　　当然，要迈出第一步困难就很多。首先是资金问题。一台中型制砖机就得五千元，他个人的钱根本买不起；更不要说扩大生产还得有其它花费。至于人手，现在倒可以雇几个人；虽然雇工还没有明确的政策，但许多地方已经有这样的现象，公家一般都睁一只眼闭一只眼。据他二爸说，报纸上现在对这问题正讨论着哩。 \n　　他首先发愁的是钱。没有办法，看来只能走贷款这条路。 \n　　这一天晚饭后，他找到了公社的徐主任和刘主任，向他们倾吐了自己的心事。 \n　　徐治功和刘根民马上表示支持他的想法，说回去以后立即给他贷款，他要多少就给贷多少。两位主任这次会上也受到了强烈刺激。别的公社都有两名以上的“冒尖户”来参加会议，就他们公社是一户，并且还是个假的！他们来参加这个会实在是脸上无光，因此决心回去也要大干一番，下决心搞出几个真正的“冒尖户”来！ \n　　“四干”会的最后一天，原西县举行了隆重的表彰“冒尖户”大会（当时俗称“夸富”会）。 \n　　这一天，原西县城一片热闹。除过参加会议的一千多名干部外，城里的机关干部和市民也都纷纷涌进了县体育场。县广播站在向全县转播大会实况。体育场挤得人山人海。主席台下，“冒尖户”们全部披红挂花，骑在高头在马上，一个个都被装扮得象状元兼驸马。人们都新奇地想挤前去看看这些光荣的老百姓。 \n　　简短的会议仪式举行完以后“夸富”大游行开始了。总指挥马国雄手里拿着个电喇叭，满头大汗地跑个不停，指挥着游行队伍按顺序出了体育场，浩浩荡荡走向大街。 \n　　游行队伍的最前边是十几班吹鼓手。这些被召来的是全县最著名的乐人，唢呐上挽着红绸花，一个个都大显神通、腮帮子鼓得象拳头一般大。唢呐声和锣鼓声震天价喧吼。四面八方鞭炮声聚起，空气中弥漫着呛人的硝烟味。 \n　　乐队后面，是骑马的“冒尖户”们。他们的�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a character who aspires to develop his own business
