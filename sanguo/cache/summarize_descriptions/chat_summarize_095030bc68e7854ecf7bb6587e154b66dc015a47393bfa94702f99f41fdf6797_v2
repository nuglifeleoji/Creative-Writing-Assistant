He is notably recognized as the owner of 赤兔马 (Red Hare), a legendary horse celebrated for its exceptional qualities. 赤兔马 is not only famous for its speed and endurance but also serves as a symbol of 关公's own virtues, embodying his strength and unwavering loyalty.\n\nIn historical accounts, 关公 acknowledges that 赤兔马 was originally ridden by 吕布 (Lü Bu), another legendary warrior. This acknowledgment highlights 关公's deep understanding and appreciation of the horse's remarkable attributes, as well as his respect for its previous owner. The relationship between 关公 and 赤兔马 is emblematic of the bond between a warrior and his steed, where the horse is seen as an extension of the warrior's own capabilities and character.\n\nOverall, 赤兔马 stands as a significant symbol in the lore surrounding 关公, representing not only the physical prowess of the warrior but also the ideals of loyalty and honor that he embodies.
