Designed to withstand extreme conditions, it serves as a critical tool for conserving and reclaiming body moisture, ensuring the user's hydration in arid climates. The stilltent is often buried in the sand to provide additional insulation and protection from the elements, as evidenced by its mention in a sandslide incident. Notably, the device is not exclusive to the Fremen; figures such as Leto have also utilized it for moisture recycling in the desert.
