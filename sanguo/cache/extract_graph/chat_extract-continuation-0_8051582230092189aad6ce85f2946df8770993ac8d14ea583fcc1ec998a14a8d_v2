�在钟提大设筵宴，会集诸将，商议伐魏之事。令史樊建谏曰：“将军屡出，未获全功；今日洮西之捷，魏人已服威名，何故又欲出也？万一不利，前功尽弃。”维曰：“汝等只知魏国地宽人广，急不可得；却不知攻魏者有五可胜。”众问之，维答曰：“彼洮西一败，挫尽锐气，吾兵虽退，不曾损折：今若进兵，一可胜也。吾兵船载而进，不致劳困，彼兵皆从旱地来迎：二可胜也。吾兵久经训练之众，彼皆乌合之徒，不曾有法度：三可胜也。吾兵自出祁山，掠抄秋谷为食：四可胜也。彼兵须各守备，军力分开，吾兵一处而去，彼安能救：五可胜也。不在此时伐魏，更待何日耶？”夏侯霸曰：“艾年虽幼，而机谋深远；近封为安西将军之职，必于各处准备，非同往日矣。”维厉声曰：“吾何畏彼哉！公等休长他人锐气，灭自己威风！吾意已决，必先取陇西。”众不敢谏。维自领前部，令众将随后而进，于是蜀兵尽离钟提，杀奔祁山来。哨马报说魏兵已先在祁山立下九个寨栅。维不信，引数骑凭高望之，果见祁山九寨势如长蛇，首尾相顾。维回顾左右曰：“夏侯霸之言，信不诬矣。此寨形势绝妙。止吾师诸葛丞相能之；今观邓艾所为，不在吾师之下。”遂回本寨。唤诸将曰：“魏人既有准备，必知吾来矣。吾料邓艾必在此间。汝等可虚张吾旗号，据此谷口下寨；每日令百余骑出哨，每出哨一回，换一番衣甲、旗号、按青、黄、赤、白、黑五方旗帜相换。吾却提大兵偷出董亭，径袭南安去也。”遂令鲍素屯兵于祁山谷口。维尽率大兵，望南安进发。\n\n

却说邓艾知蜀兵出祁山，早与陈泰下寨准备；见蜀兵连日不来搦战，一日五番哨马出寨，或十里或十五里而回。艾凭高望毕。慌入帐与陈泰曰：“姜维不在此间，必取董亭袭南安去了。出寨哨马只是这几匹。更换衣甲，往来哨探，其马皆困乏，主将必无能者。陈将军可引一军攻之，其寨可破也。破了寨栅，便引兵袭董亭之路，先断姜维之后。吾当先引一军救南安，径取武城山。若先占此山头，姜维必取上邽。上邽有一谷，名曰段谷，地狭山险，正好埋伏。彼来争武城山时，吾先伏两军于段谷，破维必矣。”泰曰：“吾守陇西二三十年，未尝如此明察地理。公之\n######################\nOutput:",
