“老师，有些人要报考的大学又不考数学，像这样的，应该已经不用在乎数学成绩了吧？”\n    石神看着发话的人。名叫森刚的同学一边抓着后颈，一边征求周遭的附和说：“对吧？”就连不是班导师的石神也知道，森刚的个头虽小，在班上却是老大。他偷偷骑摩托车上学，已经被校方警告过好几次了。\n    “森刚你要报考那样的大学吗？”石神问。\n    “如果要报考的话我一定会选那种大学。不过，目前我还不想念大学，而且不管怎样等我上了三年级都不会选修数学，所以无所谓啦，我才不在乎数学成绩。其实老师要应付我们这种笨蛋应该也很辛苦吧。所以我们不如彼此……该怎么说呢？像个成年人来处理这件事吧。”\n    “像个成年人”的这种说法似乎很滑稽，引起哄堂大笑，石神也为之苦笑。\n    “如果觉得我辛苦，这次的补考就努力及格。考试范围只有微积分，简单的很。”\n    森刚夸张的念念咋舌，往旁伸出的腿翘起了二郎腿。\n    “微积分到底有什么用处嘛，根本就是浪费时间。”\n    石神本来已面向黑板打算开始讲解期末考的考题，听到森刚这句话顿时转身，这是不容错过的发言时机。\n    “听说森刚你喜欢骑摩托车是吧？你看过摩托车比赛吗？”\n    听到这个唐突的问题，森刚满脸困惑的点点头。\n    “赛车手不能以固定的速度驾驶。不只要配合地形和风向，还得根据战术，不断变换速度。该在哪里忍耐、在哪里怎么加速，胜负全看这一瞬间的判断。你懂吗？”\n    “懂是懂啦，但这和数学有什么关系？”\n “这种加速度的变化，就是将那一刻的速度微分。说得更进一步，所谓的行走距离，就是把不停变化的速度加以积分。比赛时每辆摩托车\n\n跑的当然都是同等距离，所以为了获胜该如何调配速度的微分，就成了重要要素。怎么？这样你还认为微积分毫无用处吗？”\n    也许是无法理解石神说的内容，森刚露出困惑的表情。\n    “可是，赛车手才不会想这种事，谁管你什么微分积分，他们应该是靠经验和直觉取胜。”\n    “他们想必如此，但是从旁协助比赛的工作人员却非如此。该在哪里怎么加速才算赢，他们会反复进行模拟，推演战略，这时就会用到微\n\n积分。或许当事人自己没有意识到，但不可否认的是，他们使用的电脑软体的确应用了微积分。”\n    “既然这样，只要发明那种软体的人念数学不就好了。”\n    “也许吧，但谁也不敢保证你将来不会成为这种人。”\n    森刚夸张的往后仰身。\n
