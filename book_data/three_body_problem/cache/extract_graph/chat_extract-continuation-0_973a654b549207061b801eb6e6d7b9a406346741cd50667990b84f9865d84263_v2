生中飘落的片断，像一片羽毛般飞人自己的生活。这段记忆被浓缩成一幅幅欧洲古典油画，很奇怪，不是中国画，就是油画，中国画上空白太多，但齐家屯的生活是没有空白的，像古典的油画那样，充满着浓郁得化不开的色彩。一切都是浓烈和温热的：铺着厚厚乌拉草的火坑、铜烟锅里的关东烟和莫合烟、厚实的高粱饭、六十五度的高粱酒……但这一切，又都在宁静与平和中流逝着，像电子边上的小溪一样。\n     最令叶文洁难忘的是那些夜晚。齐猎头儿的儿子到城里卖蘑菇去了，他是屯里第一个外出挣钱的人，她就和大凤住在一起。这时齐家屯还没通电，每天晚上，她们俩守在一盏油灯旁，叶文洁看书，大凤做针线活。叶文洁总是不自觉地将书和眼睛凑近油灯，常常刘海被烤得吱啦一下，这时她俩就抬头相视而笑。大凤从来没出过这事儿，她的眼神极好，借着炭火的光也能干细活儿。两个不到半周岁的孩子睡在她身边的炕上，他们的睡相令人陶醉，屋里能听到的，只有他们均匀的呼吸声。叶文洁最初睡不惯火炕，总是上火，后来习惯了，睡梦中，她常常感觉自己变成了婴儿，躺在一个人温暖的怀抱里，这感觉是那么真切，她几次醒后都泪流满面——但那个人不是父亲和母亲，也不是死去的丈夫，她不知道是谁。\n     有一次，她放下书，看到大风把纳着的鞋底放到膝上，呆呆地看着灯花。发现叶文洁在看自己，大风突然问：\n   “姐，你说天上的星星咋的就不会掉下来呢？”\n     叶文洁细看大凤，油灯是一位卓越的画家，创作了这幅凝重色调中又带着明快的古典油画：大凤披着棉袄，红肚兜和一条圆润的胳膊露出来，油灯突出了她的形象，在她最美的部位涂上了最醒目的色彩，将其余部分高明地隐没于黑暗中。背景也隐去了，一切都淹没于一片柔和的黑暗中，但细看还是能看到一片暗红的光晕，这光晕不是来自油灯，而是地上的炭火照出来的，可以看到，外面的严寒已开始用屋里温暖的湿汽在窗户上雕出美丽的冰纹了。\n   “你害怕星星掉下来吗？” 叶文洁轻轻地问。\n     大风笑着摇摇头：“怕啥呢？它们那么小。”\n     叶文洁终于还是没有做出一个天体物理学家的回答，她只是说：“它们都很远很远，掉不下来的。”\n     大凤对这回答已经很满意，又埋头�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
