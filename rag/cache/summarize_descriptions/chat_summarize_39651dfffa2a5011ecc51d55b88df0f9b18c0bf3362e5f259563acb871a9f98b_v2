They serve as custodians of Fremen traditions, guiding their community in both cultural and spiritual matters. As mentors, the Sayyadina are responsible for teaching the ways of the Fremen, ensuring the preservation of their customs and beliefs.  \n\nA key aspect of their role is their connection to the **Reverend Mother**, the highest spiritual authority among the Fremen. The Sayyadina are part of the sacred path toward becoming a Reverend Mother, indicating their importance in the religious hierarchy. While not all Sayyadina attain this highest rank, they are integral to the process, embodying the wisdom and rituals that lead to such transcendence.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight their dual function as both teachers and spiritual guides, emphasizing their revered status. Though slightly varied in phrasing, the core meaning remains consistent: the Sayyadina are central to Fremen spirituality, bridging the gap between the people and the deeper mysteries of their faith.
