The name *Muad’Dib* serves as both a title and an identifier for Paul, reflecting his revered status within their culture. Additionally, Paul observes the constellation *Muad’Dib* in the Arrakeen sky, which symbolizes guidance and direction, further reinforcing the name's importance as a navigational and spiritual emblem. Thus, *Muad’Dib* encompasses multiple layers of meaning—representing Paul’s leadership, his divine role among the Fremen, and a celestial marker of purpose.
