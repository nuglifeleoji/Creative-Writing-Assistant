“没事。反正我有带折叠伞，脚踏车可以放在店里。明天早上，我早点出门就行了。”\n    “我送你回去。”\n    “啊，不用啦。”\n    但工藤已走上人行道，朝着计程车举起手。\n    “改天我们好好吃顿饭吧。”计程车才刚开动，工藤便说，“把你女儿一起带来也没关系。”\n    “那孩子倒是可以不用管她，可是你没问题吗？”\n    “我随时都有时间，现在已经没那么忙了。”\n    “噢。”\n    靖子说的其实是他妻子的事情，但她决定不再多问。因为她觉得他明明很清楚她的意思，只是故意装作不解其意。\n    他问起手机号码，靖子就说了，她没有理由拒绝。\n    工藤让计程车直接开到公寓门口。由于靖子坐在里侧，所以他也下了车。\n    “这样会淋湿，你快上车吧。”一下车她就说。\n    “那么下次见。”\n    “好。”靖子微微点头。\n    钻进计程车的工藤，眼睛看着她的背后。靖子顺着他的目光转头一看，楼梯下方有个男人撑伞而立。黑漆漆的看不清长相，不过她从那人的体型看出是石神。\n    石神缓缓走开了。靖子暗想，刚才工藤会看着他，八成是因为石神目不转睛地看着他们俩。\n    “我再打电话给你。”说完这句话，工藤就让计程车开走了。\n    靖子目送着远去车尾灯，她自觉心情好久没这么亢奋过了。这种和男人在一起为之陶醉的感觉，不知已睽违多少年了。\n    她看到计程车追过了石神。\n    一回到家，美里正在看电视。\n    “今天有什么状况吗？”靖子问。\n    当然不是指上学，魅力应该也很清楚。\n    “完全没有。实香什么也没说，所以我想刑警应该还没去找她。”\n    “喔。”没一会儿她的手机就响了，液晶屏幕显示是从公用电话打来的。\n    “喂？是我。”\n    “我是石神。”预期中的低沉声音传来，“今天有什么状况吗？”\n    “没什么。美里也说，她那边毫无异样。”\n    “是吗？不过请你们别大意，警方应该还没排除对你的怀疑。我想现在，他们可能正在彻底清查周边情报。”\n    “我知道了。”\n    “其他还有什么特别的事吗？”\n    “啊……？”靖子很困惑，“我说过了，没什么特别情况。”\n    “啊……说得也是。不好意思。那么，明天见。”石神挂上了电话。\n    靖子惊讶地放下手机，因为石神似乎难得如此狼狈。\n    该不会是因为看到了工藤吧，靖子想。石神或许在诧异，那个和她亲密交谈的男人究竟是什么人。也许是渴望打听工藤底细的念头，让他说出最后那个奇怪的问题。\n
