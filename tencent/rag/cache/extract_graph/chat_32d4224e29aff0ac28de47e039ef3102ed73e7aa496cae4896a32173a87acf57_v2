And what is this interest in Duncan Idaho?”\n“Dear lady, | have no companions in my loneliness. That answers both questions.” He rubbed absently at his breast where the nullentropy capsule lay concealed.\nWhy does he rub himself there so frequently? It was a gesture she and analysts had puzzled over. No scar, no skin inflammation. Perhaps merely a carryover from childhood. But that was so long ago! A flaw in this reincarnation? No one could say. And that gray skin carried a metallic pigmentation that resisted probing instruments. He was sure to have been sensitized to heavier rays and would know those were used. No... now, it was all diplomacy. Damn this little monster!\nScytale wondered: Did this powindah female have no natural sympathies on which he could play? Typica/s were ambivalent on that question.\n“The Wekht of Jandola is no more,” he said. “Billions of us Slain by those whores. To the farthest reaches of the Yaghist, we are destroyed and only | remain.”\nYaghist, she thought. Land of the unruled. It was a revealing word in Islamiyat, the Bene Tleilax language.\nIn that language, she said: “The magic of our God is our only bridge.”\nOnce more she claimed to share his Great Belief, the Sufi- Zensunni ecumenism that had spawned the Bene Tleilax. She spoke the language flawlessly, knew the proper words, but he saw falsehoods. She calls God’s Messenger “Tyrant” and disobeys the most basic precepts!\nWhere did these women meet in kehl to feel the presence of God? If they truly sooke the Language of God, they would\nalready know what they sought from him with crude bargaining.\nAs they climbed the last slope to the paved landing at Central, Scytale called on God for help. The Bene Tleilax come to this! Why have You put this trial upon us? We are the last legalists of the Shariat and I, the last Master of my people, must seek answers from you, God, when You no longer can speak to me in kehl.\nOnce more in flawless Islamiyat, Odrade said: “You were betrayed by your own people, ones you sent into the Scattering. You have no more Malik brothers, only sisters.”\nThen where is your sagra chamber, powindah deceiver? Where is a deep and windowless place only brothers may enter?\n“This is a new thing for me,” he said. “Malik Sisters? Those two words have always been self-negating. Sisters cannot be Malik.”\n“Waff, your late Mahai and Abdi, had trouble with that. And he led your people almost to extinction.”\n“Almost? You know of survivors?” He could not keep excitement from his voice.\n“No Masters... but we hear of a few Domel and all in Honored Matre hands.”\nShe paused where the edge of a building would cut off their view of the setting sun in the next steps and, still in the secret language of the Tleilaxu, said: “The sun is not God.”\nThe dawn and sunset cry of the Mahai!\nScytale felt faith wavering as he followed her into an arched passage between two squat buildings. Her words were proper but only the Mahai and Abdi should utter them. In the shadowy passage, footsteps of their escort close behind, Odrade confounded him by saying: “Why did you not say the proper words? Are you not the last Master? Does that not make you Mahai and Abdl?”\n“I was not chosen so by Malik brothers.” It sounded weak even to him.\nOdrade summoned a liftfield and paused at the tubeslot. In Other Memory detail, she found kehl and its right of ghufran familiar—words whispered in the night by lovers of long-dead women. “And then we...” “And so if we speak these sacred words. . .” Ghufran! Acceptance and readmission of one who had ventured among powindah, the returned one begging pardon for contact with unimaginable sins of aliens. The Masheikh have met in kehl and felt the presence of their God!\nThe tubeslot opened. Odrade motioned Scytale and two guards ahead. As he passed, she thought: Something must give soon. We cannot play our little game to the end he desires.\nTamalane stood at the bow window, her back to the door, when Odrade and Scytale entered the workroom. Sunset light slanted sharply across the rooftops. The brilliance vanished then and left behind it a sense of contrast, the night darker because of that last glow along the horizon.\nIn the milky gloom, Odrade waved the guards away, noting their reluctance. Bellonda had charged them to stay, obviously, but they would not disobey Mother Superior. She indicated a chairdog across from her and waited for him to sit. He looked back suspiciously at Tamalane before sinking into the 'dog but covered it by saying: “Why are there no lights?”\n“This is a relaxing interlude,” she said. And I know darkness worries you!\nShe stood a moment behind her table, identifying bright patches in the gloom, a luster of artifacts placed around her to make this her setting: the bust of long-dead Chenoeh in its niche beside the window, and there on the wall at her right, a pastoral landscape from the first human migrations into space, a stack of ridulian crystals on the table anda\nsilvery reflection off her lightscribe concentrating faint illuminations from the windows.\nHe has roasted long enough.\nShe touched a plate on her console. Glowglobes set strategically around walls and ceiling came to life. Tamalane turned on cue, her robe swishing deliberately. She stood two paces behind Scytale, the very picture of ominous Bene Gesserit mystery.\nScytale twitched slightly at Tamalane’s movement but now he sat quietly. The chairdog was somewhat too large for him and he looked almost childlike there.\nOdrade said, “Sisters who rescued you say you commanded a no-ship at Junction preparing for the first foldspace leap when Honored Matres attacked. You were coming to your ship in a one-man skitter, they said, and veered away just before the explosions. You detected the attackers?”\n“Yes.” Reluctance in his voice.\n“And knew they might locate the no-ship from your trajectory. So you fled, leaving your brothers to be destroyed.”\nHe spoke with the utter bitterness of a tragic witness: “Earlier, when we were outbound from Tleilax, we saw that attack begin. Our explosions to destroy everything of value to attackers and the burners from space created the holocaust. We fled then, too.”\n“But not directly to Junction.”\n“Everywhere we searched, they had been before us. They had the ashes but | had our secrets.” Remind her that I still have something of value to trade! He tapped a finger against his head.\n“You sought Guild or CHOAM sanctuary at Junction,” she said. “How fortunate our spy ship was there to scoop you up before the enemy could react.”\n“Sister...” How difficult that word! “...if you truly are my sister in kehl, why will you not provide me with Face Dancer\nservants?”\n“Still too many secrets between us, Scytale. Why, for instance, were you leaving Bandalong when attackers came?”\nBandalong!\nNaming the great Tleilax city constricted his chest and he thought he felt the nullentropy capsule pulse, as though it sought release for its precious contents. Lost Bandalong. Never again to see the city of carnelian skies, never to feel the presence of brothers, of patient Domel and...\n“Are you ill?” Odrade asked.\n“lam sick with what I have lost!” He heard fabric slither behind him and sensed Tamalane closer. How oppressive it was in this place! “Why is she behind me?”\n“I am the servant of my Sisters and she is here to observe us both.”\n“You've taken some of my cells, haven’t you? You’re growing a replacement Scytale in your tanks!”\n“Of course we are. You don’t think Sisters would let the last Master end here, do you?”\n“No ghola of me will do anything | would not!” And it will carry no nullentropy tube!\n“We know.” But what is it we do not know?\n“This is not bargaining,” he complained.\n“You misjudge me, Scytale. We know when you lie and when you conceal. We employ senses others do not.”\nIt was true! They detected things from odors of his body, from small movements of muscles, expressions he could not suppress.\nSisters? These creatures are powindah! All of them!\n“You were on lashkar,” Odrade prodded.\nLashkar! How he wished he were here on lashkar. Face Dance warriors. Domel assistants—eliminating this abominable evil! But he dared not lie. The one behind him probably was a Truthsayer. Experience in many lives told him Bene Gesserit Truthsayers were the best.\n“| commanded a force of khasadars. We sought a herd of Futars for our defense.”\nHerd? Did Tleilaxu know something of Futars not revealed to the Sisterhood?\n“You went prepared for violence. Did Honored Matres learn of your mission and cut you off? | think it likely.”\n“Why do you call them Honored Matres?” His voice lapsed almost into a screech.\n“Because that is what they call themselves.” Very calm now. Let him stew in his own mistakes.\nShe is right! We were betrayed. Bitter thought. He held it close, wondering how he should reply. A small revelation? There is never a small revelation with these women.\nA sigh shook his breast. The nullentropy capsule and its contents. His most important concern. Anything to get him access to his own axlotl tanks.\n“Descendants of people we sent into the Scattering returned with captive Futars. A mingling of human and cat, as you doubtless know. But they did not reproduce in our tanks. And before we could determine why, the ones brought to us died.” The betrayers brought us only two! We should have suspected.\n“They didn’t bring you very many Futars, did they? You should have suspected they were bait.”\nSee? That is what they do with small revelations!\n“Why did the Futars not hunt and kill Honored Matres on Gammu?” It was Duncan’s question and deserved an answer.\n“We were told no orders were given. They do not kill without orders.” She knows this. She is testing me.\n“Face Dancers also kill on order,” she said. “They would even kill you if you ordered it. Not so?”\n“That order is reserved for keeping our secrets from the hands of enemies.”\n“Is that why you want your own Face Dancers? Do you consider us enemies?”\nBefore he could compose a response, Bellonda’s projected figure appeared above the table, lifesize and partly translucent, dancing crystals of Archives behind her. “Urgent from Sheeana!” Bellonda said. “The spice blow has occurred. Sandworms!” The figure turned and looked at Scytale, comeyes perfectly coordinating her movements. “So you have lost a bargaining chip, Master Scytale! We have our spice at last!” The projected figure vanished with an audible click and a faint smell of ozone.\n“You're trying to trick me!” he blurted.\nBut the door at Odrade’s left opened. Sheeana entered towing a small Suspensor pod no more than two meters long\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_32d4224e29aff0ac28de47e039ef3102ed73e7aa496cae4896a32173a87acf57_v2"}
