Despite this observation, Jessica ultimately dismisses Mapes after their exchange, asserting her authority in the situation. The dynamic between the two reflects Jessica's position of power, as she both evaluates Mapes' qualities and reinforces her own dominance by ending their interaction on her own terms. This brief but layered encounter highlights Jessica's discernment and command, while also acknowledging Mapes' strength and adaptability as a Fremen.
