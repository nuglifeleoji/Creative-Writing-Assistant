�于殿阶之下。帝赐平身，宣谕慰劳。操曰：“臣向蒙国恩，刻思图报。今傕、汜二贼，罪恶贯盈；臣有精兵二十余万，以顺讨逆，无不克捷。陛下善保龙体，以社稷为重。”帝乃封操领司隶校尉假节钺录尚书事。\n\n    却说李傕、郭汜知操远来，议欲速战。贾诩谏曰：“不可。操兵精将勇，不如降之，求免本身之罪。”傕怒曰：“尔敢灭吾锐气！”拔剑欲斩诩。众将劝免。是夜，贾诩单马走回乡里去了。次日，李傕军马来迎操兵。操先令许褚、曹仁、典韦领三百铁骑，于傕阵中冲突三遭，方才布阵。阵圆处，李傕侄李暹、李别出马阵前，未及开言，许褚飞马过去，一刀先斩李暹；李别吃了一惊，倒撞下马，褚亦斩之，双挽人头回阵。曹操抚许褚之背曰：“子真吾之樊哙也！”随令夏侯惇领兵左出、曹仁领兵右出，操自领中军冲阵。鼓响一声，三军齐进。贼兵抵敌不住，大败而走。操亲掣宝剑押阵，率众连夜追杀，剿戮极多，降者不计其数。傕、汜望西逃命，忙忙似丧家之狗；自知无处容身，只得往山中落草去了。曹操回兵，仍屯于洛阳城外。杨奉、韩暹两个商议：“今曹操成了大功，必掌重权，如何容得我等？”乃入奏天子，只以追杀傕、汜为名，引本部军屯于大梁去了。\n\n    帝一日命人至操营，宣操入宫议事。操闻天使至，请入相见，只见那人眉清目秀，精神充足。操暗想曰：“今东都大荒，官僚军民皆有饥色，此人何得独肥？”因问之曰：“公尊颜充腴，以何调理而至此？”对曰：“某无他法，只食淡三十年矣。”操乃颔之；又问曰：“君居何职？”对曰：“某举孝廉。原为袁绍、张杨从事。今闻天子还都，特来朝觐，官封正议郎。济阴定陶人，姓董，名昭，字公仁。”曹操避席曰：“闻名久矣！幸得于此相见。”遂置酒帐中相待，令与荀彧相会。忽人报曰：“一队军往东而去，不知何人。”操急令人探之。董昭曰：“此乃李傕旧将杨奉，与白波帅韩暹，因明公来此，故引兵欲投大梁去耳。”操曰：“莫非疑操乎？”昭曰：“此乃无谋之辈，明公何足虑也。”操又曰：“李、郭二贼此去若何？”昭曰：“虎无爪，鸟无翼，不久当为明公所擒，无足介意。”\n######################\nOutput:",
