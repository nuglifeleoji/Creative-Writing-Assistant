They have repeatedly created gholas—cloned replicas with restored memories—of Duncan Idaho, a skilled swordsman and loyal retainer, as part of their agreements with powerful entities such as the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the God Emperor Leto II. These gholas are sent to serve Leto, though Idaho himself harbors suspicions about the Tleilaxu's motives and potential tampering with his resurrected form.  \n\nThe Tleilaxu's involvement with Duncan Idaho underscores their role as manipulative bio-engineers, leveraging their ghola technology to fulfill political and strategic obligations while maintaining an air of secrecy. Despite Idaho's wariness, his repeated resurrections highlight his enduring significance in the power struggles of the universe.
