，孙少安拿着这些“文件”进了田福堂家。他向书记详细汇报了一队今年的这新打算、新办法；并且把开会的情况也给书记说了。 \n　　田福堂听了这事，就象耳朵边响了一声炸雷，都懵了！他半天弄不懂倒究发生了什么事！ \n　　但有一点他很快明白了过来：一队长胆大包天，准备带上社员走资本主义道路了！ \n　　他一时不知该对少安说什么。 \n　　本来，他自己可以毫不犹豫地一口否定这无法无天的行为。但听少安汇报说，一队的社员都拥护这样做；并且是全体一致通过的。这样一来，他就先不能忙着表明他的态度了——当然，他就是立即表态反对，他也肯定是正确的！这样做，一队的社员就都会骂他田福堂；而这个队大部分又都是他的同族人。如果田家圪崂的人起来反对他，那他田福堂在双水村就成了孤家寡人。不能！先把少安这小子打发走，让他想一想再说！ \n　　他于是就对等待他表态的少安说：“这么大的事，我田福堂一个人怎敢给你们表态？你先回去，等我和大队其他人开会研究后再答复你们！” \n　　少安就马上从书记家告辞了。 \n　　田福堂手里拿着少安放下的“材料”，就象拿着一颗即将爆炸的手榴弹，慌慌忙忙地把孙玉亭叫到了家里。 \n　　孙玉亭一听这情况，立刻震惊得张大了嘴巴。他激愤地说：“毛主席老人家一去世，人的心胆越来越大了！竟敢明目张胆走资本主义道路！这还了得！没王法了！”田福堂讥讽说：“你们家出了大人物，敢领着群众造社会主义的反！” \n　　孙玉亭坚定地说：“谁反对社会主义，我就反对谁！别说是我的侄儿，就是我父亲现在活着，他反对社会主义，我也坚决不答应！ \n　　田福堂说：“不论怎样，你侄子已经闹腾成了这个样子，你说怎么办？” \n　　“把那小子捆起来！扭送到石圪节去！”孙玉亭气愤地说。“也不必这样。咱是不是先开个支部会，看他们其他人怎说？” \n　　“这还要开什么支部会哩？”孙玉亭说，“这明摆着是走资本主义道路嘛！他们其他领导人还敢支持吗？干脆，别再费这神了，你赶快到公社汇报去！” \n　　孙玉亭一下子提醒了田福堂。对！这么严重的路线斗争，不是双水村能够解决了的，应该马上向上级汇报！田福堂说走就走，骑上自行车很快动身去石圪节公社，找白明川和徐治功汇报去了。 \n　　与此同时，孙玉亭连家也没回，火急火燎地找到他哥孙玉厚，让他赶紧说服孙少安不要再执迷不悟；否则，恐怕公安局的法绳就要套到他娃娃的脖子上了！
