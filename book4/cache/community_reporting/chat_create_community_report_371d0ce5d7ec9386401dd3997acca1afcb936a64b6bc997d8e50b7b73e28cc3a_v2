This river area was the site from which many villagers were relocated, a process that deeply impacted their identity and heritage. The relocation was part of broader initiatives during the Great Leap Forward, a campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China’s economy through industrialization and collectivization.\n\nDuring this period, plans were made to construct a significant reservoir on the Heilong River, which would have altered the landscape and the lives of those living in the vicinity. The proposed reservoir was intended to support agricultural and industrial development, reflecting the ambitious goals of the Great Leap Forward. However, the construction and the associated relocations led to profound changes in the community, as villagers were displaced from their ancestral lands, which were integral to their cultural identity.\n\nThe Heilong River, therefore, is not just a geographical feature; it embodies the struggles and transformations faced by the local population during a tumultuous period in Chinese history.
