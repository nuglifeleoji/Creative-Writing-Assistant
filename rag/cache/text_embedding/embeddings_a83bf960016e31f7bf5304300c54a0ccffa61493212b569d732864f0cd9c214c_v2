She had been required to believe so many things she now knew were nonsense. Myths and chimera, impulses of extremely childish behavior.\n“Our gods should mature as we mature.”\nRebecca suppressed a smile.

She saw that someone was reviewing the catalogue of food stores. The Rabbi watched this with his normal intensity. Others had rolled themselves into blankets and were sleeping on the cots in the darkened end of the chamber. Seeing all of this, Rebecca knew what her function must be. Keep us from boredom.\n“The games master?”\nUnless you have something better to suggest, don’t try to tell me about my own people, Speaker.\nWhatever else she might say about these inner conversations, there was no doubt that all of the pieces were connected—the past with this room, this room with her projections of consequences. And that was a great gift from the Bene Gesserit. Do not think of “The Future.” Predestination? Then what happens to the freedom you are given at birth?\nRebecca looked at her own birth in a new light. It had embarked her on movement toward an unknown destiny. Fraught with unseen perils and joys. So they had come around a bend in the river and found attackers. The next bend might reveal a cataract or a stretch of peaceful beauty. And here lay the magical enticement of prescience, the lure to which Muad’Dib and his Tyrant son had succumbed. The oracle knows what is to come! The horde of Lampadas had taught her not to seek oracles. The known could beleaguer her more than the unknown. The sweetness of the new lay in its surprises. Could the Rabbi see it?\n“Who will tell us what happens next?” he asks.\nIs that what you want, Rabbi? You will not like what you hear. | guarantee it.

Like a runaway tube train in its wormhole, your life will soeed through to its final moment of confrontation.

Don't let the terrible things | have seen come to pass!”\nAbruptly, she saw that this must have been Muad’Dib’s travail. To whom had he muttered his prayers?\n“Rebecca!” It was the Rabbi calling her.\nShe went to where he stood beside Joshua now, looking at the dark world outside of their chamber as it was revealed in the small projection above Joshua’s instruments.\n“There is a storm coming,” the Rabbi said. “Joshua thinks it will make a cement of the ash pit.”\n“That is good,” she said. “It is why we built here and left the cover off the pit when we entered.”\n“But how do we get out?” “We have tools for that,” she said. “And even without tools, there’s always our hands.”\nA major concept guides the Missionaria Protectiva: Purposeful instruction of the masses. This is firmly seated in our belief that the aim of argument should be to change the nature of truth. In such matters, we prefer the use of power rather than force.\n—THE CODA\nT° Duncan Idaho, life in the no-ship had taken on the air of a peculiar game since the advent of his vision and insights into Honored Matre behavior. Entry of Teg into the game was a deceptive move, not just the introduction of another player.\nHe stood beside his console this morning and recognized elements in this game parallel to his own ghola childhood at the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu with the aging Bashar as weapons master-guardian.\nEducation. That had been a primary concern then as it was now. And the guards, mostly unobtrusive in the no-ship but always there as they had been on Gammu. Or their spy devices present, artfully camouflaged and blended into the decor. He had become an adept at evading them on Gammu. Here, with Sheeana’s help, he had raised evasion to a fine art.\nActivity around him was reduced to low background. Guards carried no weapons. But they were mostly Reverend Mothers with a few senior acolytes. They would not believe they needed weapons.\nSome things in the no-ship contributed to an illusion of freedom, chiefly its size and complexity. The ship was large, how large he could not determine but he had access to many floors and to corridors that ran for more than a thousand paces.\nTubes and tunnels, access piping that conveyed him in Suspensor pods, dropchutes and lifts, conventional hallways and wide corridors with hatches that hissed open at a touch (or remained sealed: Forbidden!)—all of it was a place to lock in memory, becoming there his own turf, private to him in a way far different from what it was to guards.\nThe energy required to bring the ship down to the planet and maintain it spoke of a major commitment. The Sisterhood could not count the cost in any ordinary way. The comptroller of the Bene Gesserit treasury did not deal merely in monetary counters. Not for them the Solar or comparable currencies. They banked on their people, on food, on payments due sometimes for millennia, payments often in kind—both materials and loyalties.\nPay up, Duncan! We're calling in your note!\nThis ship was not just a prison. He had considered several Mentat Projections. Prime: it was a laboratory where Reverend Mothers sought a way to nullify a no-ship’s ability to confuse human senses.\nA no-ship gameboard—puzzle and warren. All to confine three prisoners? No. There had to be other reasons.\nThe game had secret rules, some he could only guess. But he had found it reassuring when Sheeana entered into the spirit of it. / Knew she would have her own plans. Obvious when she began practicing Honored Matre techniques. Polishing my trainees!\nSheeana wanted intimate information about Murbella and much more—his memories of people he had known in his many lives, especially memories of the Tyrant.\nAnd I want information about the Bene Gesserit.\nThe Sisterhood kept him in minimal activity. Frustrating him to increase Mentat abilities. He was not at the heart of that larger problem he sensed outside the ship. Tantalizing fragments came to him when Odrade gave him glimpses of their predicament through her questions.\nEnough to offer new premises? Not without access to data that his console refused to display.\nIt was his problem, too, damn them! He was in a box within their box. All of them trapped.\nOdrade had stood beside this console one afternoon a week ago and blandly assured him the Sisterhood’s data sources were “opened wide” to him. Right there she had stood, her back to the counter, leaning on it casually, arms folded across her breast. Her resemblance to the adult Miles Teg was uncanny at times. Even to that need (was it a compulsion?) to stand while talking. She disliked chairdogs, too.\nHe knew he had an extremely loose comprehension of her motives and plans. But he didn’t trust them. Not after Gammu.\nDecoy and bait. That was how they had used him. He was lucky not to have gone the way of Dune—a dead husk. Used up by the Bene Gesserit.\nWhen he fidgeted this way, Idaho preferred to slump into the chair at his console. Sometimes, he sat here for hours, immobile, his mind trying to encompass complexities of the ship’s powerful data resources. The system could identify any human in it. So it has automatic monitors. It had to know who was speaking, making demands, assuming temporary command.\nFlight circuits defy my attempts to break through the locks. Disconnected? That was what his guards said. But the ship’s way of identifying who tapped the circuits—he knew his key lay there.\nWould Sheeana help? It was a dangerous gamble to trust her too much. Sometimes when she watched him at his console he was reminded of Odrade. Sheeana was Odrade’s student. That was a sobering memory.\nWhat was their interest in how he used Shipsystems? As if he needed to ask!\nDuring his third year here he had made the system hide data for him, doing this with his own keys. To thwart the prying comeyes, he hid his actions in plain sight. Obvious insertions for later retrieval but with an encrypted second message. Easy for a Mentat and useful mostly as a trick, exploring the potentials of Shipsystems. He had booby- trapped his data to a random dump without hope of recovery.\nBellonda suspected, but when she questioned him about it, he only smiled.\n| hide my history, Bell. My serial lives as a ghola—all of them back to the original non-ghola. Intimate things | remember about those experiences: a dumping ground for poignant memories.\nSitting now at the console, he experienced mixed feelings. Confinement galled him. No matter the size and richness of his prison, it still was a prison. He had known for some time that he very likely could escape but Murbella and his increasing knowledge about their predicament held him. He felt as much a prisoner of his thoughts as of the elaborate system represented by guards and this monstrous device. The no-ship was a device, of course. A tool. A way to move unseen in a dangerous universe. A means of concealing yourself and your intentions even from prescient searchers.\nWith accumulated skills of many lifetimes, he looked on his surroundings through a screen of sophistication and naivete. Mentats cultivated naivete. Thinking you knew something was a Sure way to blind yourself. It was not growing up that slowly applied brakes to learning (Mentats were taught) but an accumulation of “things | know.”\nNew data sources the Sisterhood had opened to him (if he could rely on them) raised questions. How was opposition to Honored Matres organized in the Scattering? Obviously there were groups (he hesitated to call them powers) who hunted Honored Matres the way Honored Matres hunted the\nBene Gesserit. Killed them, too, if you accepted Gammu evidence.\nFutars and Handlers? He made a Mentat Projection: A Tleilaxu offshoot in the first Scattering had engaged in genetic manipulations. Those two he saw in his vision: were they the ones who created Futars? Could that couple be Face Dancers? Independent of Tleilaxu Masters? All was not singular in the Scattering.\nDammit! He needed access to more data, to potent sources. His present sources were not even remotely adequate. A tool of limited purpose, his console could be adapted to larger requirements but his adaptations limped. He needed to stride out as a Mentat!\nI’ve been hobbled and that’s a mistake. Doesn’t Odrade trust me? She’s an Atreides, damn her! She knows what I owe her family.\nMore than one lifetime and the debt never paid!\nHe knew he was fidgeting. Abruptly, his mind locked on that. Mentat fidgeting! A signal that he stood poised at the edge of breakthrough. A Prime Projection! Something they had not told him about Teg?\nQuestions! There were unasked questions lashing at him.\n| need perspective! Not necessarily a matter of distance. You", " that couple be Face Dancers? Independent of Tleilaxu Masters? All was not singular in the Scattering.\nDammit! He needed access to more data, to potent sources. His present sources were not even remotely adequate.

Mentat fidgeting! A signal that he stood poised at the edge of breakthrough. A Prime Projection! Something they had not told him about Teg?\nQuestions! There were unasked questions lashing at him.\n| need perspective! Not necessarily a matter of distance. You could gain perspective from within if your questions carried few distortions.\nHe sensed that somewhere in Bene Gesserit experiences (perhaps even in Bell’s jealously guarded Archives) lay missing pieces. Bell should appreciate this! A fellow Mentat must know the excitement of this moment. His thoughts were like tesserae, most of the pieces at hand and ready to fit into a mosaic. It was not a matter of solutions.\nHe could hear his first Mentat teacher, the words rumbling in his mind: “Assemble your questions in counterpoise and toss your temporary data onto one side of the scales or the other. Solutions unbalance any situation. Imbalances reveal what you seek.”\nYes! Achieving imbalances with sensitized questions was a Mentat’s juggling act.\nSomething Murbella had said the night before—what? They had been in her bed. He recalled seeing the time projected on the ceiling: 9:47. And he had thought: That projection takes energy.\nHe could almost feel the flow of the ship’s power, this giant enclosure cut out of Time. Frictionless machinery to create a mimetic presence no instrument could distinguish from natural background. Except for now when it was on standby, shielded not from eyes but from prescience.\nMurbella beside him: another kind of power, both aware of the force trying to pull them together. The energy it took to suppress that mutual magnetism! Sexual attraction building and building and building.\nMurbella talking. Yes, that was it. Oddly self-analytic. She approached her own life with a new maturity, a Bene Gesserit—heightened awareness and confidence that something of great strength grew in her.\nEvery time he recognized this Bene Gesserit change, he felt sad. Nearer the day of our parting.\nBut Murbella was talking. “She (Odrade was often ‘she’) keeps asking me to assess my love for you.”\nRemembering this, Idaho allowed it to replay.\n“She has tried the same approach with me.”\n“What do you say?”\n“Odi et amo. Excrucior.”\nShe lifted herself on one elbow and looked down at him. “What language is that?”\n“A very old one Leto had me learn once.”\n“Translate.” Peremptory. Her old Honored Matre self.\n“I hate her and | love her. And | am racked.”\n“Do you really hate me?” Unbelieving.\n“What I hate is being tied this way, not the master of my self.”\n“Would you leave me if you could?”\n“I want the decision to recur moment by moment. | want control of it.”\n“It’s a game where one of the pieces can’t be moved.”\nThere it was! Her words.\nRemembering, Idaho felt no elation but as though his eyes had suddenly been opened after a long sleep. A game where one of the pieces can’t be moved. Game. His view of the no-ship and what the Sisterhood did here.\nThere was more to the exchange.\n“The ship is our own special school,” Murbella said.\nHe could only agree. The Sisterhood reinforced his Mentat Capacities to screen data and display what had not gone through. He sensed where this might lead and felt leaden fear.\n“You Clear the nerve passages. You block off distractions and useless mind-wanderings.”\nYou redirected your responses into that dangerous mode every Mentat was warned to avoid. “You can lose yourself there.”\nStudents were taken to see human vegetables, “failed Mentats,” kept alive to demonstrate the peril.\nHow tempting, though. You could sense the power in that mode. Nothing hidden. All things known.\nIn the midst of that fear, Murbella turning toward him on the bed, he felt the sexual tensions become almost explosive.\nNot yet. Not yet!\nOne of them had said something else. What? He had been thinking about the limits of logic as a tool to expose the Sisterhood’s motives.\n“Do you often try to analyze them?” Murbella asked.\nUncanny how she did that, addressing his unspoken thoughts. She denied she read minds. “I just read you, ghola mine. You are mine, you know.”\n“And vice versa.”\n“Too true.” Almost bantering but it covered something deeper and convoluted.\nThere was a pitfall in any analysis of human psyches and he said this. “Thinking you Know why you behave as you do gives you all sorts of excuses for extraordinary behavior.”\nExcuses for extraordinary behavior! There was another piece in his mosaic. More of the game but these counters were guilt and blame.\nMurbella’s voice was almost musing. “I Suppose you can rationalize almost anything by laying it on some trauma.”\n“Rationalize such things as burning entire planets?”\n“There’s a kind of brutal self-determination in that. She says making determined choices firms up the psyche and gives you a sense of identity you can rely on under stress. Do you agree, Mentat mine?”\n“The Mentat is not yours.” No force in his voice.\nMurbella laughed and slumped back onto her pillow. “You know what the Sisters want of us, Mentat mine?”\n“They want our children.”\n“Oh, much more than that. They want our willing participation in their dream.”\nAnother piece of the mosaic!\nBut who other than a Bene Gesserit knew that dream? The Sisters were actresses, always performing, letting little that was real come through their masks. The real person was walled in and metered out as needed.\n“Why does she keep that old painting?” Murbella asked.\nIdaho felt his stomach muscles tighten. Odrade had brought him a holorecord of the painting she kept in her sleeping chamber. Cottages at Cordeville by Vincent Van Gogh. Awakening him in this bed at some witching hour of the night almost a month ago.\n“You asked for my hold on humanity and here it is.” Thrusting the holo in front of his sleep-fogged eyes. He sat up and stared at the thing, trying to comprehend. What was wrong with her? Odrade sounded so excited.\nShe left the holo in his hands while she turned on all of the lights, giving the room a sense of hard and immediate shapes, everything vaguely mechanical the way you would expect it in a no-ship. Where was Murbella? They had gone to sleep together.\nHe focused on the holo and it touched him in an unaccountable way, as though it linked him to Odrade. Her hold on her humanity? The holo felt cold to his hands. She took it from him and propped it on the side table where he stared at it while she found a chair and sat near his head. Sitting? Something compelled her to be near him!\n“It was painted by a madman on Old Terra,” she said, bringing her cheek close to his while both looked at the copy of the painting. “Look at it! An encapsulated human moment.”\nIn a landscape? Yes, dammit. She was right.\nHe stared at the holo. Those marvelous colors! It was not just the colors. It was the totality.\n“Most modern artists would laugh at the way he created that,” Odrade said.\nCouldn’t she be silent while he looked at it?\n“That was a human being as ultimate recorder,” Odrade said. “The human hand, the human eye, the human essence brought to focus in the awareness of one person who tested the limits.”\nTested the limits! More of the mosaic.\n“Van Gogh did that with the most primitive materials and equipment.” She sounded almost drunk. “Pigments a caveman would have recognized! Painted on a fabric he could have made with his own hands. He might have made the tools himself from fur and wild twigs.”\nShe touched the surface of the holo, her finger placing a shadow across the tall trees. “The cultural level was crude by our standards, but see what he produced?”\nIdaho felt he should say something but words would not come. Where was Murbella? Why wasn’t she here?\nOdrade pulled back and her next words burned themselves into him.\n“That painting says you cannot suppress the wild thing, the uniqueness that will occur among humans no matter how much we try to avoid it.”\nIdaho tore his gaze away from the holo and looked at Odrade’s lips when she spoke.\n“Vincent told us something important about our fellows in the Scattering.”\nThis long-dead painter? About the Scattering?\n“They have done things out there and are doing things we cannot imagine. Wild things! The explosive size of that Scattered population insures it.”\nMurbella entered the room behind Odrade, belting a soft white robe, her feet bare. Her hair was damp from a shower. So that was where she had gone.\n“Mother Superior?” Murbella’s voice was sleepy.\nOdrade spoke over her shoulder without fully turning. “Honored Matres think they can anticipate and control every wildness. What nonsense. They cannot even control it in themselves.”\nMurbella came around to the foot of the bed and stared questioningly at Idaho. “I seem to have come in on the middle of a conversation.”\n“Balance, that’s the key,” Odrade said.\nIdaho kept his attention on Mother Superior.\n“Humans can balance on strange surfaces,” Odrade said. “Even on unpredictable ones. It’s called ‘getting in tune.’ Great musicians know it. Surfers | watched when | was a child on Gammu, they knew it. Some waves throw you but you're prepared for that. You climb back up and go at it once more.”\nFor no reason he could explain, Idaho thought of another thing Odrade had said: “We have no attic storerooms. We recycle everything.”\nRecycle. Cycle. Pieces of the circle. Pieces of the mosaic.\nHe was random hunting and knew better. Not the Mentat way. Recycle, though—Other Memory was not an attic storeroom then but something they considered as recycling. It meant they used their past only to change it and renew it.\nGetting in tune.\nA strange allusion from someone who claimed she avoided music.\nRemembering, he sensed his mental mosaic. It had become a jumble. Nothing fitted anywhere. Random pieces that probably did not go together at all.\nBut they did!\nMother Superior’s voice continued in his memory. So there is more.\n“People who know this go to the heart of it,” Odrade said. “They warn that you cannot think about what you’re doing. That’s a sure way to fail. You just do it!”\nDon’t think. Do it. He sensed anarchy. Her words threw him back onto resources other than Mentat training.\nBene Gesserit trickery! She did this deliberately, knowing the effect. Where was the affection he sometimes felt radiating from her? Could she have concern for the well- being of someone she treated this way?\nWhen Odrade left them (", " It meant they used their past only to change it and renew it.\nGetting in tune.\nA strange allusion from someone who claimed she avoided music.\nRemembering, he sensed his mental mosaic.

Where was the affection he sometimes felt radiating from her? Could she have concern for the well- being of someone she treated this way?\nWhen Odrade left them (he barely noticed her departure), Murbella sat on the bed and straightened the robe around her knees.\nHumans can balance on strange surfaces. Movement in his mind: the pieces of the mosaic trying to find relationships.\nHe felt a new surge in the universe. Those two strange people in his vision? They were part of it. He knew this without being able to say why. What was it the Bene Gesserit claimed? “We modify old fashions and old beliefs.”\n“Look at me!” Murbella said.\nVoice? Not quite but now he was sure she tried it on and she had not told him they were training her in this witchery.\nHe saw the alien look in her green eyes that told him she was thinking about her former associates.\n“Never try to be more clever than the Bene Gesserit, Duncan.”\nSpeaking for the comeyes?\nHe could not be sure. It was the intelligence behind her eyes that gripped him these days. He could feel it growing there, as though her teachers blew into a balloon and Murbella’s intellect expanded the way her abdomen expanded with new life.\nVoice! What were they doing to her?\nThat was a stupid question. He knew what they were doing. They were taking her away from him, making a Sister of her. No longer my lover, my marvelous Murbella. A Reverend Mother then, remotely calculating in everything she did. A witch. Who could love a witch?\n| could. And always will.\n“They grab you from your blind side to use you for their own purposes,” he said.\nHe could see his words take hold. She had awakened to this trap after the fact. The Bene Gesserit were so damnably clever! They had enticed her into their trap, giving her small glimpses of things as magnetic as the force binding her to him. It could only be an enraging realization to an Honored Matre.\nWe trap others! They do not trap us!\nBut this had been done by the Bene Gesserit. They were in a different category. Almost Sisters. Why deny it? And she wanted their abilities. She wanted out of this probation into the full teaching she could sense just beyond the ship’s walls. Didn’t she know why they still kept her on probation?\nThey know she still struggles in their trap.\nMurbella slipped out of her robe and climbed into the bed beside him. Not touching. But keeping that armed sense of nearness between their bodies.\n“They originally intended me to control Sheeana for them,” he said.\n“As you control me?”\n“Do | control you?”\n“Sometimes | think you’re a comic, Duncan.”\n“If | can’t laugh at myself I’m really lost.”\n“Laugh at your pretensions to humor, too?”\n“Those first.” He turned toward her and cupped her left breast in his hand, feeling the nipple harden under his palm. “Did you know I was never weaned?”\n“Never in all of those...”\n“Not once.”\n“I might have guessed.” A smile formed fleetingly on her lips, and abruptly both of them were laughing, clutching each other, helpless with it. Presently, Murbella said, “Damn, damn, damn.”\n“Damn who?” as his laughter subsided and they pulled apart, forcing the separation.\n“Not who, what. Damn fate!”\n“| don’t think fate cares.”\n“| love you and I’m not supposed to do that if I’m to be a proper Reverend Mother.”\nHe hated these excursions so close to self-pity. Joke then! “You've never been a proper anything.” He massaged the pregnant swelling of her abdomen.\n“Lam proper!”\n“That’s a word they left out when they made you.”\nShe pushed his hand away and sat up to look down at him. “Reverend Mothers are never supposed to love.”\n“I know that.” Did my anguish reveal itself?\nShe was too caught up in her own worries. “When | get to the Spice Agony...”\n“Love! | don’t like the idea of agony associated with you in any way.”\n“How can | avoid it? I’m already in the chute. Very soon they'll have me up to speed. l'Il go very fast then.”\nHe wanted to turn away but her eyes held him.\n“Truly, Duncan. | can feel it. In a way, it’s like pregnancy. There comes a point when it’s too dangerous to abort. You must go through with it.”\n“So we love each other!” Forcing his thoughts away from one danger into another.\n“And they forbid it.”\nHe looked up at the comeyes. “The watchdogs are watching us and they have fangs.”\n“I know. l'm talking to them right now. My love for you is not a flaw. Their coldness is the flaw. They’re just like Honored Matres!”\nA game where one of the pieces can’t be moved.\nHe wanted to shout it but listeners behind the comeyes would hear more than spoken words. Murbella was right. It was dangerous to think you could gull Reverend Mothers.\nSomething veiled in her eyes as she looked down at him. “How very strange you looked just then.” He recognized the Reverend Mother she might become.\nVeer away from that thought!\nThinking about the strangeness of his memories sometimes diverted her. She thought his previous incarnations made him somehow similar to a Reverend Mother.\n“I’ve died so many times.”\n“You remember it?” The same question every time.\nHe shook his head, not daring to say anything more for the watchdogs to interpret.\nNot the deaths and reawakenings.\nThose became dulled by repetition. Sometimes he didn’t even bother to put them into his secret data-dump. No... it was the unique encounters with other humans, the long collection of recognitions.\nThat was a thing Sheeana claimed she wanted from him. “Intimate trivia. It’s the stuff all artists want.”\nSheeana did not know what she asked. All of those living encounters had created new meanings. Patterns within patterns. Minuscule things gained a poignancy he despaired of sharing with anyone... even with Murbella.\nThe touch of a hand on my arm. A Cchild’s laughing face. The glitter in an attacker’s eyes.\nMundane things without counting. A familiar voice saying: “Į just want to put my feet up and collapse tonight. Don’t ask me to move.”\nAll had become part of him. They were bound into his character. Living had cemented them inextricably and he could not explain it to anyone.\nMurbella spoke without looking at him. “There were many women in those lives of yours.”\n“I’ve never counted them.”\n“Did you love them?”\n“They’re dead, Murbella. All | can promise is that there are no jealous ghosts in my past.”\nMurbella extinguished the glowglobes. He closed his eyes and felt darkness close in as she crept into his arms. He held her tightly, knowing she needed it, but his mind rolled of its own volition.\nAn old memory produced a Mentat teacher’s saying: “The greatest relevancy can become irrelevant in the space of a heartbeat. Mentats should look upon such moments with joy.”\nHe felt no joy.\nAll of those serial lives continued within him in defiance of Mentat relevancies. A Mentat came at his universe fresh in each instant. Nothing old, nothing new, nothing set in ancient adhesives, nothing truly known. You were the net and you existed only to examine the catch.\nWhat did not go through? How fine a mesh did I use on this lot?\nThat was the Mentat view. But there was no way the Tleilaxu could have included all of those ghola-Idaho cells to\nrecreate him. There had to be gaps in their serial collection of his cells. He had identified many of those gaps.\nBut no gaps in my memory. | remember them all.\nHe was a network linked outside of Time. That is how I can see the people of that vision... the net. It was the only explanation Mentat awareness could provide and if the Sisterhood guessed, they would be terrified. No matter how many times he denied it, they would say: “Another Kwisatz Haderach! Kill him!”\nSo work for yourself, Mentat!\nHe knew he had most of the mosaic pieces but still they did not go together in that Ahh, hah! assembly of questions Mentats prized.\nA game where one of the pieces can’t be moved.\nExcuses for extraordinary behavior.\n“They want our willing participation in their dream.”\nTest the limits!\nHumans can balance on strange surfaces.\nGet in tune. Don’t think. Do it.\nThe best art imitates life in a compelling way. If it imitates a dream, it must be a dream of life. Otherwise, there is no place where we can connect. Our plugs don’t fit.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nA’ they traveled south toward the desert in the early afternoon, Odrade found the countryside disturbingly changed from her previous inspection three months earlier. She felt vindicated in having chosen ground vehicles. Views framed by the thick plaz protecting them from the dust revealed more details at this level.\nMuch drier.\nHer immediate party rode in a relatively light car—only fifteen passengers including the driver. Suspensors and sophisticated jet drive when they were not on ground-effect. Capable of a smooth three hundred klicks an hour on the glaze. Her escort (too large, thanks to an overzealous Tamalane) followed in a bus that also carried changes of clothing, foods and drinks for wayside stops.\nStreggi, seated beside Odrade and behind the driver, said: “Could we not manage a small rain here, Mother Superior?”\nOdrade’s lips thinned. Silence was the best answer.\nThey had been late starting. All of them assembled on the loading dock and were ready to leave when a message came down from Bellonda. Another disaster report requiring Mother Superior’s personal attention at the last minute!\nIt was one of those times when Odrade felt her only possible role was that of official interpreter. Walk to the edge of the stage and tell them what it meant: “Today,\nSisters, we learned that Honored Matres have obliterated four more of our planets. We are that much smaller.”\nOnly twelve planets (including Buzzell) and the faceless hunter with the axe is that much closer.\nOdrade felt the chasm yawning beneath her.\nBellonda had been ordered to contain this latest bad news until a more appropriate moment.\nOdrade looked out the window beside her. What was an appropriate moment for such news?\nThey had been driving south a little more than three hours, the burner-glazed roadway like a green river ahead of them. This passage led them through hillsides of cork oaks that stretched out to ridge-enclosed horizons.
