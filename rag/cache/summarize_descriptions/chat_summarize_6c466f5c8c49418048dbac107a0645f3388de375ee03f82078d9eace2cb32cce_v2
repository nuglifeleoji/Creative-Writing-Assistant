These colossal beings are fiercely territorial and highly dangerous to humans, often attacking those who venture too close. They are intrinsically linked to the production of the valuable substance known as spice, as they defend and inhabit the spice deposits scattered across Arrakis.  \n\nBeyond their ecological significance, sandworms hold deep cultural and religious importance, particularly among the Fremen, who revere them as sacred entities. The creatures are also pivotal to the transformation of Leto Atreides II, who merges with sandworm biology to become the God Emperor, a figure of immense power and longevity. Thus, sandworms are not only formidable predators but also symbols of transformation, spice production, and Fremen spirituality on Arrakis.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the descriptions by emphasizing their dual nature as both physical threats and metaphysical symbols, while clarifying their role in spice ecology and Leto's ascension.
