�叫着后退。除了被蓝轩宇先前冰锥射中眼睛那只之外，整整四十九只熔岩犬围在外面，犬视眈眈，不断的发出嘶吼。但也终于止住了攻击，毕竟，它们也只是十年魂兽而已。\n\n    “哎呦，总算是安全了，吓死我了真是。”钱磊大叫一声，一屁股坐倒在地。\n\n    蓝轩宇没好气的道：“以前你们赢过这初级训练？”\n\n    钱磊道：“赢过一次啊！那次我召唤出一只巨熊，拍的这些熔岩犬哭爹叫娘的。哈哈。就连百年魂兽都挡不住。百年熔岩犬的火球喷吐在它身上都伤害不了它。不过那次我精神力透支，足足休息了两天才恢复过来。”\n\n    “你说什么？”蓝轩宇的表情突然凝固了。因为，他从钱磊的话语中捕捉到了几个重要的状况。\n\n    百年熔岩犬，火球……\n\n    是啊！还有三只百年魂兽没出现呢，竟然也是熔岩犬，还能喷火球……\n\n    普通熔岩犬冲不进冰刺，可是，冰刺是冰啊，会化的啊！普通熔岩犬身上的温度就已经会让冰刺加速融化了，那百年熔岩犬的火球……\n\n    “砰——”冰刺哗啦啦断了几根，外面一片火红。\n\n    远处，三头身长足有一米八开外的巨大熔岩犬缓缓走来，刚才那火球，正是其中一只喷吐的，另外两只嘴里也在冒烟，显而易见，火球将接踵而来。\n\n    完蛋……\n\n    蓝轩宇心头一阵无奈，他这冰刺，顶多再挡住一枚火球就不错了。\n\n    果然，两枚火球呼啸而来。\n\n    “我来！”刘锋动了，他猛的跃起，身体在半空中竟是还有一个悬停，身上的魂环光芒一闪，人就冲了出去。正是第一魂技，白龙闪！\n\n    人随枪走，手中白龙枪上挑，从侧面挑中一枚火球，火球顿时改变方向，居然朝着熔岩犬方向飞去。身上魂环光芒再闪，他居然在空中近乎不可思议的完成了一次变向，但这次明显有点冲过头了，竟是直接撞向了火球。\n\n    一根银纹蓝银草恰到好处的出现在他身后，缠绕住他腰间让他提前停顿，白龙枪刺出，总算是改变了火球的方向。\n\n    “轰、轰！”两声，两枚火球分别炸开，化为无数火花四散纷飞。七、八只十年熔岩犬被牵累，炸的惨叫连连，也让狗群变得有些混乱。\n\n    银纹蓝银草后拉，强行把刘锋从空中拉了回来，但此时他却已经是脸色苍白，双手户口破裂，鲜血直流。眼看是没什么战斗力了。\n------------\n\n第八十九章 银纹�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
