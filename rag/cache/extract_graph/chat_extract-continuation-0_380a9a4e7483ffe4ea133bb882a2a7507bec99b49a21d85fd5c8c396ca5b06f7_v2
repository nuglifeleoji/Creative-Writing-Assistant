He felt the movement of sandtrout as a movement within himself. Fremen had lived with the strange creatures for generations, knowing that if you risked a bit of water as bait, you could lure them into reach. Many a Fremen dying of thirst had risked his last few drops of water in this gamble, knowing that the sweet green syrup teased from a sandtrout might yield a small profit in energy. But the sandtrout were mostly the game of children who caught them for the Huanui. And for play.\nLeto shuddered at the thought of what that play meant to him now.\nHe felt one of the creatures slither across his bare foot. It hesitated, then went on, attracted by the greater amount of\nwater in the qanat.\nFor a moment, though, he’d felt the reality of his terrible decision. The sandtrout glove. It was the play of children. If one held a sandtrout in the hand, smoothing it over your Skin, it formed a living glove. Traces of blood in the skin’s capillaries could be sensed by the creatures, but something mingled with the blood’s water repelled them. Sooner or later, the glove would slip off into the sand, there to be lifted into a spice-fiber basket. The spice soothed them until they were dumped into the deathstill.\nHe could hear sandtrout dropping into the qanat, the swirl of predators eating them. Water softened the sandtrout, made it pliable. Children learned this early. A bit of saliva teased out the sweet syrup. Leto listened to the splashing. This was a migration of sandtrout come up to the open water, but they could not contain a flowing qanat patrolled by predator fish.\nStill they came; still they splashed.\nLeto groped on the sand with his right hand until his fingers encountered the leathery skin of a sandtrout. It was the large one he had expected. The creature didn’t try to evade him, but moved eagerly onto his flesh. He explored its outline with his free hand—roughly diamond-shaped. It had no head, no extremities, no eyes, yet it could find water unerringly. With its fellows it could join body to body, locking one on another by the coarse interlacings of extruded cilia until the whole became one large sack-organism enclosing the water, walling off the “poison” from the giant which the Sandtrout would become: Shai-Hulud.\nThe sandtrout squirmed on his hand, elongating, stretching. As it moved, he felt a counterpart elongating and stretching of the vision he had chosen. This thread, not that one. He felt the sandtrout becoming thin, covering more and more of his hand. No sandtrout had ever before encountered a hand such as this one, every cell supersaturated with spice. No other human had ever before lived and reasoned\nin such a condition. Delicately Leto adjusted his enzyme balance, drawing on the illuminated sureness he'd gained in spice trance. The knowledge from those uncounted lifetimes which blended themselves within him provided the certainty through which he chose the precise adjustments, staving off the death from an overdose which would engulf him if he relaxed his watchfulness for only a heartbeat. And at the same time he blended himself with the sandtrout, feeding on it, feeding it, learning it. His trance vision provided the template and he followed it precisely.\nLeto felt the sandtrout grow thin, spreading itself over more and more of his hand, reaching up his arm. He located another, placed it over the first one. Contact ignited a frenzied squirming in the creatures. Their cilia locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow. The sandtrout adjusted to the living glove of childhood play, but thinner and more sensitive as he lured it into the role of a skin symbiote. He reached down with the living glove, felt sand, each grain distinct to his senses. This was no longer sandtrout; it was tougher, stronger. And it would grow stronger and stronger. . . His groping hand encountered another sandtrout which whipped itself into union with the first two and adapted itself to the new role. Leathery softness insinuated itself up his arm to his shoulder.\nWith a terrible singleness of concentration he achieved the union of his new skin with his body, preventing rejection. No corner of his attention was left to dwell upon the terrifying consequences of what he did here. Only the necessities of his trance vision mattered. Only the Golden Path could come from this ordeal.\nLeto shed his robe and lay naked upon the sand, his gloved arm outstretched into the path of migrating Sandtrout. He remembered that once he and Ghanima had caught a sandtrout, abraded it against the sand until it contracted into the chi/d-worm, a stiff tube, its interior\npregnant with the green syrup. One bit gently upon the end and sucked swiftly before the wound was healed, gaining the few drops of sweetness.\nThey were all over his body now. He could feel the pulse of his blood against the living membrane. One tried to cover his face, but he moved it roughly until it elongated into a thin roll. The thing grew much longer than the child-worm, remaining flexible. Leto bit the end of it, tasted a thin stream of sweetness which continued far longer than any Fremen had ever before experienced. He could feel energy from the sweetness flow through him. A curious excitement suffused his body. He was kept busy for a time rolling the membrane away from his face until he’d built up a stiff ridge circling from jaw to forehead and leaving his ears exposed.\nNow the vision must be tested.\nHe got to his feet, turned to run back toward the hut and, as he moved, found his feet moving too fast for him to balance. He plunged into the sand, rolled and leaped to his feet. The leap took him two meters off the sand and, when he fell back, trying to walk, he again moved too fast.\nStop! he commanded himself. He fell into the prana-bindu forced relaxation, gathering his senses into the pool of consciousness. This focused the inward ripples of the constant-now through which he experienced Time, and he allowed the vision-elation to warm him. The membrane worked precisely as the vision had predicted.\nMy skin is not my own.\nBut his muscles took some training to live with this amplified movement. When he walked, he fell, rolling. Presently he sat. In the quiet, the ridge below his jaw tried to become a membrane covering his mouth. He spat against it and bit, tasting the sweet syrup. It rolled downward to the pressure of his hand.\nEnough time had passed to form the union with his body. Leto stretched flat and turned onto his face. He began to crawl, rasping the membrane against the sand. He could\nfeel the sand distinctly, but nothing abraded his own flesh. With only a few swimming movements he traversed fifty meters of sand. The physical reaction was a friction-induced warming sensation.\nThe membrane no longer tried to cover his nose and mouth, but now he faced the second major step onto his Golden Path. His exertions had taken him beyond the qanat into the canyon where the trapped worm stayed. He heard it hissing toward him, attracted by his movements.\nLeto leaped to his feet, intending to stand and wait, but the amplified movement sent him sprawling twenty meters farther into the canyon. Controlling his reactions with terrible effort, he sat back onto his haunches, straightened. Now the sand began to swell directly in front of him, rising up in a monstrous starlit curve. Sand opened only two body lengths from him. Crystal teeth flashed in the dim light. He saw the yawning mouth-cavern with, far back, the ambient movement of dim flame. The overpowering redolence of the spice swept over him. But the worm had stopped. It remained in front of him as First Moon lifted over the butte. The light reflected off the worm’s teeth outlining the faery glow of chemical fires deep within the creature.\nSo deep was the inbred Fremen fear that Leto found himself torn by a desire to flee. But his vision held him motionless, fascinated by this prolonged moment. No one had ever before stood this close to the mouth of a living worm and survived. Gently Leto moved his right foot, met a sand ridge and, reacting too quickly, was propelled toward the worm’s mouth. He came to a stop on his knees.\nStill the worm did not move.\nIt sensed only the sandtrout and would not attack the deep-sand vector of its own kind. The worm would attack another worm in its territory and would come to exposed spice. Only a water barrier stopped it—and sandtrout, encapsulating water, were a water barrier.\nExperimentally, Leto moved a hand toward that awesome mouth. The worm drew back a full meter.\nConfidence restored, Leto turned away from the worm and began teaching his muscles to live with their new power. Cautiously he walked back toward the qanat. The worm remained motionless behind him. When Leto was beyond the water barrier he leaped with joy, went sailing ten meters across the sand, sprawled, rolled, laughed.\nLight flared on the sand as the hut’s doorseal was breached. Sabiha stood outlined in the yellow and purple glow of the lamp, staring out at him.\nLaughing, Leto ran back across the qanat, stopped in front of the worm, turned and faced her with his arms outstretched.\n“Look!” he called. “The worm does my bidding!”\nAs she stood in frozen shock, he whirled, went racing around the worm and into the canyon. Gaining experience with his new skin, he found he could run with only the lightest flexing of muscles. It was almost effortless. When he put effort into running, he raced over the sand with the wind burning the exposed circle of his face. At the canyon’s dead end instead of stopping, he leaped up a full fifteen meters, clawed at the cliff, scrabbled, climbing like an insect, and came out on the crest above the Tanzerouft.\nThe desert stretched before him, a vast silvery undulance in the moonlight.\nLeto’s manic exhilaration receded.\nHe squatted, sensing how light his body felt. Exertion had produced a slick film of perspiration which a stillsuit would have absorbed and routed into the transfer tissue which removed the salts. Even as he relaxed, the film disappeared now, absorbed by the membrane faster than a stillsuit could have done it. Thoughtfully Leto rolled a length of the membrane beneath his lips, pulled it into his mouth, and drank the sweetness.\nHis mouth was not masked, though. Fremen-wise, he sensed his body’s moisture being wasted with every breath. Leto brought a section of the membrane over his mouth, rolled it back when it tried to seal his nostrils, kept at this until the rolled barrier remained in place. In the desert way, he fell into the automatic breathing pattern: in through his nose, out through his mouth. The membrane over his mouth protruded in a small bubble, but remained in place. No moisture collected on his lips and his nostrils remained open. The adaptation proceeded, then.\nA 'thopter flew between Leto and the moon, banked, and came in for a spread-wing landing on the butte perhaps a hundred meters to his left. Leto glanced at it, turned, and looked back the way he had come up the canyon. Many lights could be seen down there beyond the qanat, a stirring of a multitude. He heard faint outcries, sensed hysteria in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SANATROUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sanatrout is a term used to describe the sandtrout creatures that are central to Fremen life and culture on Arrakis\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a central character undergoing a transformation by merging with sandtrout to achieve his vision of the Golden Path\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are the native inhabitants of Arrakis, known for their survival skills and deep connection with the desert and sandtrout\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shai-Hulud is the Fremen name for the giant sandworms of Arrakis, which are the adult form of sandtrout\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is the desert planet where the events take place, home to the Fremen and the sandworms\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TANZEROUFT<|>GEO<|>The Tanzerouft is a vast desert region on Arrakis\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is Leto's vision for the future, which he achieves by merging with sandtrout\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is Leto's sister, mentioned in his memories of childhood\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SABIHA<|>PERSON<|>Sabiha is a character who witnesses Leto's transformation and is shocked by it\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SANATROUT<|>Leto merges with sandtrout to transform his body and achieve the Golden Path<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>Leto's transformation is part of his vision to achieve the Golden Path<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FREMEN<|>Leto is a member of the Fremen and uses their knowledge to merge with sandtrout<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>Leto's transformation with sandtrout is a step toward becoming like Shai-Hulud<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ARRAKIS<|>Leto's transformation and the events take place on the planet Arrakis<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TANZEROUFT<|>Leto climbs to the crest above the Tanzerouft during his transformation<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GHANIMA<|>Leto remembers his sister Ghanima during his transformation<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SABIHA<|>Sabiha witnesses Leto's transformation and is shocked by it<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>SANATROUT<|>The Fremen have a deep cultural and survival connection with sandtrout<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Fremen are the native inhabitants of Arrakis<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANATROUT<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>Sandtrout are the juvenile form of Shai-Hulud, the giant sandworms<|>9\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
