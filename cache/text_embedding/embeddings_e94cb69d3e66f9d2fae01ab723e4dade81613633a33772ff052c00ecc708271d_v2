From that Holy Hoard, the priesthood possessed God’s own voice, His printed words and even holophotos. Everything was explained and they knew that the desert surface of Rakis reproduced the original form of the planet, the way it looked in the beginning when it was the only known source of the Holy Spice.\n“She asks about God’s family,” Stiros said. “Why should she have to ask about—”\n“She tests us. Do we give Them Their proper places? The Reverend Mother Jessica to her son, Muad’Dib, to his son, Leto II—the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven.”\n“Leto Ill,” Stiros muttered. “What of the other Leto who died at Sardaukar hands? What of him?”\n“Careful, Stiros,” Tuek intoned. “You know my great- grandfather pronounced upon that question from this very bench. Our Divided God was reincarnated with part of Him remaining in heaven to mediate the Ascendancy. That part of Him became nameless then, as the True Essence of God should always be!”\n“Oh?”\nTuek heard the terrible cynicism in the old man’s voice. Stiros’ words seemed to tremble in the incense-laden air, inviting terrible retribution.\n“Then why does she ask how our Leto was transformed into the Divided God?” Stiros demanded.\nDid Stiros question the Holy Metamorphosis? Tuek was aghast. He said: “In time, she will enlighten us.”\n“Our feeble explanations must fill her with dismay,” Stiros sneered.\n“You go too far, Stiros!”\n“Indeed? You do not think it enlightening that she asks how the sandtrout encapsulate most of Rakis’ water and re- create the desert?”\nTuek tried to conceal his growing anger. Stiros did represent a powerful faction in the priesthood, but his tone and his words raised questions that had been answered by High Priests long ago. The Metamorphosis of Leto II had given birth to uncounted sandtrout, each carrying a Bit of Himself. Sandtrout to Divided God: The sequence was known and worshiped. To question this denied God.\n“You sit here and do nothing!” Stiros accused. “We are pawns of—”\n“Enough!” Tuek had heard all he wanted to hear of this old man’s cynicism. Drawing his dignity around him, Tuek spoke the words of God:\n“Your Lord knows very well what is in your heart. Your soul suffices this day as a reckoner against you. | need no witnesses. You do not listen to your soul, but listen instead to your anger and your rage.”\nStiros retired in frustration.\nAfter considerable thought, Tuek enrobed himself in his most suitable finery of white, gold, and purple. He went to visit Sheeana.\nSheeana was in the roof garden atop the central priestly complex, there with Cania and two others—a young priest named Baldik, who was in Tuek’s private service, and an acolyte priestess named Kipuna, who behaved too much like a Reverend Mother for Tuek’s liking. The Sisterhood had its spies here, of course, but Tuek did not like to be aware of it. Kipuna had taken over much of Sheeana’s physical training and there had grown a rapport between child and acolyte priestess that aroused Cania’s jealousy. Even Cania, however, could not stand in the way of Sheeana’s commands.\nThe four of them stood beside a stone bench almost in the shadow of a ventilator tower. Kipuna held Sheeana’s right hand, manipulating the child’s fingers. Sheeana was growing tall, Tuek noted. Six years she had been his charge. He could see the first beginnings of breasts poking out her robe. There was not a breath of wind on the rooftop and the air felt heavy in Tuek’s lungs.\nTuek glanced around the garden to assure himself that his security arrangements were not being ignored. One never knew from what quarter danger might appear. Four of Tuek’s own personal guards, well armed but concealing it, shared the rooftop at a distance—one at each corner. The parapet enclosing the garden was a high one, just the guards’ heads standing above the rim. The only building higher than this priestly tower was Keen’s primary windtrap about a thousand meters to the west.\nDespite the visible evidence that his security orders were being carried out, Tuek sensed danger. Was God warning him? Tuek still felt disturbed by Stiros’ cynicism. Was it wrong to allow Stiros that much latitude?\nSheeana saw Tuek approaching and stopped the odd finger-flexing exercises she was performing at Kipuna’s instructions. Giving every appearance of knowledgeable patience, the child stood silently with her gaze fixed on the High Priest, forcing her companions to turn and watch with her.\nSheeana did not find Tuek a fearsome figure. She rather liked the old man although some of his questions were so bumbling. And his answers! Quite by accident, she had discovered the question that most disturbed Tuek.\n“Why?”\nSome of the attendant priests interpreted her question aloud as: “Why do you believe this?” Sheeana immediately picked up on this and thereafter her probings of Tuek and the others took the unvarying form:\n“Why do you believe this?”\nTuek stopped about two paces from Sheeana and bowed. “Good afternoon, Sheeana.” He twisted his neck nervously against the collar of his robe. The sun felt hot on his shoulders and he wondered why the child chose to be out here so often.\nSheeana maintained her probing stare at Tuek. She knew this gaze disturbed him.\nTuek cleared his throat. When Sheeana looked at him that way, he always wondered: /s it God looking at me through her eyes?\nCania spoke. “Sheeana has been asking today about the Fish Speakers.”\nIn his most unctuous tones, Tuek said: “God’s own Holy Army.”\n“All of them women?” Sheeana asked. She spoke as though she could not believe it. To those at the base of Rakian society, Fish Speakers were a name from ancient history, people cast out in the Famine Times.\nShe is testing me, Tuek thought. Fish Speakers. The modern carriers of the name had only a small trading-spying delegation on Rakis, composed of both men and women. Their ancient origins no longer were significant to their current activities, mostly working as an arm of Ix.\n“Men always served the Fish Speakers in an advisory Capacity,” Tuek said. He watched carefully to see how Sheeana would respond.\n“Then there were always the Duncan Idahos,” Cania said.\n“Yes, yes, of course: the Duncans.” Tuek tried not to scowl. That woman was always interrupting! Tuek did not like being reminded of this aspect to God’s historical presence on Rakis. The recurrent ghola and his position in the Holy Army carried overtones of Bene Tleilax indulgence. But there was no avoiding the fact that Fish Speakers had guarded the Duncans from harm, acting of course at the behest of God. The Duncans were holy, no doubt of it, but in a special category. By God’s own account, He had killed\nsome of the Duncans himself, obviously trans/ating them immediately into heaven.\n“Kipuna had been telling me about the Bene Gesserit,” Sheeana said.\nHow the child’s mind darted around!\nTuek cleared his throat, recognizing his own ambivalent attitude toward the Reverend Mothers. Reverence was demanded for those who were “Beloved of God,” such as the Saintly Chenoeh. And the first High Priest had constructed a logical account of how the Holy Hwi Noree, Bride of God, had been a secret Reverend Mother. Honoring these special circumstances, the priesthood felt an irritating responsibility toward the Bene Gesserit, which was carried out chiefly by selling melange to the Sisterhood at a price ridiculously below that charged by the Tleilaxu.\nIn her most ingenuous tones, Sheeana said: “Tell me about the Bene Gesserit, Hedley.”\nTuek glanced sharply at the adults around Sheeana, trying to catch a smile on their faces. He did not know how to deal with Sheeana calling him by his first name that way. In one sense, it was demeaning. In another sense, she honored him by such intimacy.\nGod tests me sorely, he thought.\n“Are the Reverend Mothers good people?” Sheeana asked.\nTuek sighed. The records all confirmed that God harbored reservations about the Sisterhood. God’s words had been examined carefully and submitted finally to a High Priest’s interpretation. God did not let the Sisterhood threaten his Golden Path. That much was clear.\n“Many of them are good,” Tuek said.\n“Where is the nearest Reverend Mother?” Sheeana asked.\n“At the Sisterhood’s Embassy here in Keen,” Tuek said.\n“Do you know her?”\n“There are many Reverend Mothers in the Bene Gesserit Keep,” he said.\n“What’s a Keep?”\n“That’s what they call their home here.”\n“One Reverend Mother must be in charge. Do you know that one?”\n“I knew her predecessor, Tamalane, but this one is new. She has only just arrived. Her name is Odrade.”\n“That’s a funny name.”\nTuek’s own thought, but he said: “One of our historians tells me it is a form of the name Atreides.”\nSheeana reflected upon this. Atreides. That was the family that had brought Shaitan into being. Before the Atreides there had been only the Fremen and Shai-hulud. The Oral History, which her people preserved against all priestly prohibition, chanted the begats of the most important people on Rakis. Sheeana had heard these names many nights in her village.\n“Muad’Dib begat the Tyrant.”\n“The Tyrant begat Shaitan.”\nSheeana did not feel like arguing truth with Tuek. Anyway, he looked tired today. She said merely: “Bring me this Reverend Mother Odrade.”\nKipuna hid a gloating smile behind her hand.\nTuek stepped back, aghast. How could he comply with such a demand? Even the Rakian priesthood did not command the Bene Gesserit! What if the Sisterhood refused him? Could he offer a gift of melange in exchange? That might be a sign of weakness. The Reverend Mothers might bargain! No harder bargainers lived than the Sisterhood’s cold-eyed Reverend Mothers. This new one, this Odrade, looked to be one of the worst.\nAll of these thoughts fled through Tuek’s mind in an instant.\nCania intruded, giving Tuek the needed approach. “Perhaps Kipuna could convey Sheeana’s invitation,” Cania said.\nTuek darted a glance at the young acolyte priestess. Yes! Many suspected (Cania among them, obviously) that Kipuna\nspied for the Bene Gesserit. Of course, everyone on Rakis spied for someone. Tuek put on his most gracious smile as he nodded to Kipuna.\n“Do you know any of the Reverend Mothers, Kipuna?”\n“Some of them are known to me, My Lord High Priest,” Kipuna said.\nAt least she still shows the proper deference!\n“Excellent,” Tuek said. “Would you be so kind as to start this gracious invitation from Sheeana moving up through the Sisterhood’s embassy.”\n“I will do my poor best, My Lord High", ".\nAll of these thoughts fled through Tuek’s mind in an instant.\nCania intruded, giving Tuek the needed approach. “Perhaps Kipuna could convey Sheeana’s invitation,” Cania said.\nTuek darted a glance at the young acolyte priestess. Yes! Many suspected (Cania among them, obviously) that Kipuna\nspied for the Bene Gesserit. Of course, everyone on Rakis spied for someone. Tuek put on his most gracious smile as he nodded to Kipuna.\n“Do you know any of the Reverend Mothers, Kipuna?”\n“Some of them are known to me, My Lord High Priest,” Kipuna said.\nAt least she still shows the proper deference!\n“Excellent,” Tuek said. “Would you be so kind as to start this gracious invitation from Sheeana moving up through the Sisterhood’s embassy.”\n“I will do my poor best, My Lord High Priest.”\n“I’m sure you will!”\nKipuna began a prideful turn toward Sheeana, the knowledge of success growing within her. Sheeana’s request had been ridiculously easy to ignite, given the techniques provided by the Sisterhood. Kipuna smiled and opened her mouth to speak. A movement at the parapet about forty meters behind Sheeana caught Kipuna’s attention. Something glinted in the sunlight there. Something small and...\nWith a strangled cry, Kipuna grabbed up Sheeana, hurled her at the startled Tuek and shouted: “Run!” With that, Kipuna dashed toward the swiftly advancing brightness—a tiny seeker trailing a long length of shigawire.\nIn his younger days, Tuek had played batball. He caught Sheeana instinctively, hesitated for an instant and then recognized the danger. Whirling with the squirming, protesting girl in his arms, Tuek dashed through the open door of the stair tower. He heard the door slam behind him and Cania’s rapid footsteps close on his heels.\n“What is it? What is it?” Sheeana pounded her fists against Tuek’s chest as she shouted.\n“Hush, Sheeana! Hush!” Tuek paused on the first landing. Both a chute and suspensor-drop led from this landing into the building’s core. Cania stopped beside Tuek, her panting loud in the narrow space.\n“It killed Kipuna and two of your guards,” Cania gasped. “Cut them up! | saw it. God preserve us!”\nTuek’s mind was a maelstrom. Both the chute and the Suspensor-drop system were enclosed wormholes through the tower. They could be sabotaged. The attack on the roof might be only one element in a far more complex plot.\n“Put me down!” Sheeana insisted. “What’s happening?”\nTuek eased her to the floor but kept one of her hands clutched in his hand. He bent over her, “Sheeana, dear, someone is trying to harm us.”\nSheeana’s mouth formed a silent “O,” then: “They hurt Kipuna?”\nTuek looked up at the roof door. Was that an ornithopter he heard up there? Stiros! Conspirators could take three vulnerable people into the desert so easily!\nCania had regained her breath. “I hear a ‘thopter,” she said. “Shouldn't we be getting away from here?”\n“We will go down by the stairs,” Tuek said.\n“But the—”\n“Do as | say!”\nKeeping a firm hold on Sheeana’s hand, Tuek led the way down to the next landing. In addition to the chute and Suspensor access, this landing had a door into a wide curving hall. Only a few short steps beyond the door lay the entrance to Sheeana’s quarters, once Tuek’s own quarters. Again, he hesitated.\n“Something’s happening on the roof,” Cania whispered.\nTuek looked down at the fearfully silent child beside him. Her hand felt sweaty.\nYes, there was some sort of uproar on the roof—shouts, the hiss of burners, much running about. The roof door, now out of sight above them, crashed open. This decided Tuek. He flung open the door into the hallway and dashed out into the arms of a tightly grouped wedge of black-robed women. With an empty sense of defeat, Tuek recognized the woman at the point of the wedge: Odrade!\nSomeone plucked Sheeana away from him and hustled her back into the press of robed figures. Before Tuek or Cania could protest, hands were clapped over their mouths. Other hands pinioned them against a wall of the hallway. Some of the robed figures went through the doorway and up the stairs.\n“The child is safe and that’s all that’s important for the moment,” Odrade whispered. She looked into Tuek’s eyes. “Make no outcry.” The hand was removed from his mouth. Using Voice, she said: “Tell me about the roof!”\nTuek found himself complying without reservation. “A seeker towing a long shigawire. It came over the parapet. Kipuna saw it and—”\n“Where is Kipuna?”\n“Dead. Cania saw it.” Tuek described Kipuna’s brave dash toward the threat.\nKipuna dead! Odrade thought. She concealed a fiercely angry sense of loss. What a waste. There must be admiration for such a brave death, but the loss! The Sisterhood always needed such courage and devotion, but it also required the genetic wealth Kipuna had represented. /t was gone, taken by these stumbling fools!\nAt a gesture from Odrade, the hand was removed from Cania’s mouth. “Tell me what you saw,” Odrade said.\n“The seeker whipped the shigawire around Kipuna’s neck and...” Cania shuddered.\nThe dull thump of an explosion reverberated above them, then silence. Odrade waved a hand. Robed women spread along the hallway, moving silently out of sight beyond the curve. Only Odrade and two others, both chill-eyed younger women with intense expressions, remained beside Tuek and Cania. Sheeana was nowhere to be seen.\n“The Ixians are in this somewhere,” Odrade said.\nTuek agreed. That much shigawire... “Where have you taken the child?” he asked.\n“We are protecting her,” Odrade said. “Be still.” She tipped her head, listening.\nA robed woman sped back around the curve of the hallway and whispered something in Odrade’s ear. Odrade produced a tight smile.\n“It is over,” Odrade said. “We will go to Sheeana.”\nSheeana occupied a softly cushioned blue chair in the main room of her quarters. Black-robed women stood ina protective arc behind her. The child appeared to Tuek quite recovered from the shock of the attack and escape but her eyes glittered with excitement and unasked questions. Sheeana’s attention was directed at something off to Tuek’s right. He stopped and looked there, gasping at what he saw.\nA naked male body lay against the wall in an oddly crumpled position, the head twisted until the chin lay back over the left shoulder. Open eyes stared out with the emptiness of death.\nStiros!\nThe shredded rags of Stiros’ robe, obviously torn from him violently, lay in an untidy heap near the body’s feet.\nTuek looked at Odrade.\n“He was in on it,” she said. “There were Face Dancers with the Ixians.”\nTuek tried to swallow in a dry throat.\nCania shuffled past him toward the body. Tuek could not see her face but Cania’s presence reminded him that there had been something between Stiros and Cania in their younger days. Tuek moved instinctively to place himself between Cania and the seated child.\nCania stopped at the body and nudged it with a foot. She turned a gloating expression on Tuek. “I had to make sure he was really dead,” she said.\nOdrade glanced at a companion. “Get rid of the body.” She looked at Sheeana. It was Odrade’s first chance for a more careful study of the child since leading the assault force here to deal with the attack on the temple complex.\nTuek spoke behind Odrade. “Reverend Mother, could you explain please what—”\nOdrade interrupted without turning. “Later.”\nSheeana’s expression quickened at Tuek’s words. “l thought you were a Reverend Mother!”\nOdrade merely nodded. What a fascinating child. Odrade experienced the sensations she felt while standing in front of the ancient painting in Taraza’s quarters. Some of the fire that had gone into the work of art inspired Odrade now. Wild inspiration! That was the message from the mad Van Gogh. Chaos brought into magnificent order. Was that not part of the Sisterhood’s coda?\nThis child is my canvas, Odrade thought. She felt her hand tingle to the feeling of that ancient brush. Her nostrils flared to the smells of oils and pigments.\n“Leave me alone with Sheeana,” Odrade ordered. “Everybody out.”\nTuek started to protest but stopped when one of Odrade’s robed companions gripped his arm. Odrade glared at him.\n“The Bene Gesserit have served you before,” she said. “This time, we saved your life.”\nThe woman holding Tuek’s arm tugged at him.\n“Answer his questions,” Odrade said. “But do it somewhere else.”\nCania took a step toward Sheeana. “That child is my—”\n“Leave!” Odrade barked, all the powers of Voice in the command.\nCania froze.\n“You almost lost her to a bumbling lot of conspirators!” Odrade said, glaring at Cania. “We will consider whether you get any further opportunity to associate with Sheeana.”\nTears started in Cania’s eyes but Odrade’s condemnation could not be denied. Turning, Cania fled with the others.\nOdrade returned her attention to the watchful child.\n“We've been a long time waiting for you,” Odrade said. “We will not give those fools another opportunity to lose\nyou.\n”\nLaw always chooses sides on the basis of enforcement power. Morality and legal niceties have little to do with it when the real question is: Who has the clout?\n—BENE GESSERIT COUNCIL PROCEEDINGS: ARCHIVES #X0X232\nmmediately after Taraza and her party left Gammu, Teg\nthrew himself into his work. New in-Keep procedures had to be laid out, holding Schwangyu at arm’s length from the ghola. Taraza’s orders.\n“She can observe all she wants. She can’t touch.”\nIn spite of the work pressures, Teg found himself staring into space at odd moments, prey to free-floating anxiety.

It took a moment to relocate himself.\nMidmorning. Taraza and her party had been gone two days. He was alone. Yes, Patrin had taken over this day’s training schedule with Duncan, freeing Teg for the command decisions.\nThe workroom around Teg felt alien. Yet, when he looked at each element in it, he found each thing familiar. Here was his own personal data console. His uniform jacket had been draped neatly across a chair-back beside him. He tried to fall into Mentat mode and found his own mind resisting. He had not encountered that phenomenon since training days.\nTraining days.\nTaraza and Odrade between them had thrown him back into some form of training.\nSelf-training.\nIn a detached way, he felt his memory offering up a long- ago conversation with Taraza. How familiar it was. He was right there, caught in the moments of his own memory- snare.\nBoth he and Taraza had been quite tired after making the decisions and taking the actions to prevent a bloody confrontation—the Barandiko incident. Nothing but a hiccough in history now but at the time it had demanded all of their combined energies.\nTaraza invited him into the small parlor of her quarters on her no-ship after the agreement was signed. She spoke casually, admiring his sagacity, the way he had seen through to the weaknesses that would force a compromise.\nThey had been awake and active for almost thirty hours and Teg was glad for the opportunity to sit while Taraza dialed her foodrink installation. It dutifully produced two tall glasses of creamy brown liquid.\nTeg recognized the smell as she handed him his glass. It was a quick source of energy, a pick-me-up that the Bene Gesserit seldom shared with outsiders. But Taraza no longer considered him an outsider.\nHis head tipped back, Teg took a long swallow of the drink, his gaze on the ornate ceiling of Taraza’s small parlor. This no-ship was an old-fashioned model, built in the days when more care had been taken with decoration—heavily incised cornices, baroque figures carved in every surface.\nThe taste of the drink pushed his memory back into childhood, the heavy infusion of melange...\n“My mother made this for me whenever I was overly strenuous,” he said, looking at the glass in his hand. He already could feel the calming energy flow through his body.\nTaraza took her own drink to a chairdog opposite him, a fluffy white bit of animate furniture that fitted itself to her with the ease of long familiarity. For Teg, she had provided a traditional green upholstered chair, but she saw his glance flick across the chairdog and grinned at him.\n“Tastes differ, Miles.” She sipped her drink and sighed. “My, that was strenuous but it was good work. There were moments when it was right on the edge of getting very nasty.”\nTeg found himself touched by her relaxation. No pose, no ready-made mask to set them apart and define their separate roles in the Bene Gesserit hierarchy. She was being obviously friendly and not even a hint of seductiveness. So this was just what it seemed to be—as much as that could be said about any encounter with a Reverend Mother.\nWith quick elation, Teg realized that he had become quite adept at reading Alma Mavis Taraza, even when she adopted one of her masks.\n“Your mother taught you more than she was told to teach you,” Taraza said. “A wise woman but another heretic. That’s all we seem to be breeding nowadays.”\n“Heretic?” He was caught by resentment.\n“That’s a private joke in the Sisterhood,” Taraza said. “We're supposed to follow a Mother Superior’s orders with absolute devotion. And we do, except when we disagree.”\nTeg smiled and took a deep draught of his drink.\n“It’s odd,” Taraza said, “but while we were in that tight little confrontation | found myself reacting to you as | would to one of my Sisters.”\nTeg felt the drink warming his stomach. It left a tingling in his nostrils. He placed the empty glass on a side table and spoke while looking at it. “My eldest daughter...”\n“That would be Dimela. You should have let us have her, Miles.”\n“It was not my decision.”\n“But one word from you...” Taraza shrugged. “Well, that’s past. What about Dimela?”\n“She thinks I’m often too much like one of you.”\n“Too much?”\n“She is fiercely loyal to me, Mother Superior. She doesn’t really understand our relationship and—”\n“What is our relationship?”\n“You command and | obey.”\nTaraza looked at him over the lip of her glass. When she put down the glass, she said: “Yes, you’ve never really been a heretic, Miles. Perhaps ...someday...”\nHe spoke quickly, wanting to divert Taraza from such ideas. “Dimela thinks the long use of melange makes many people become like you.”\n“Is that so? Isn’t it odd, Miles, that a geriatric potion should have so many side effects?”\n“I don’t find that odd.”\n“No, of course you wouldn’t.” She drained her glass and put it aside. “I was addressing the way a significant life extension has produced in some people, you especially, a profound knowledge of human nature.”\n“We live longer and observe more,” he said.\n“I don’t think it’s quite that simple. Some people never observe anything. Life just happens to them. They get by on little more than a kind of dumb persistence, and they resist with anger and resentment anything that might lift them out of that false serenity.”\n“I’ve never been able to strike an acceptable balance sheet for the spice,” he said, referring to a common Mentat process of data sorting.\nTaraza nodded. Obviously, she found the same difficulty. “We of the Sisterhood tend to be more single-track than Mentats,” she said. “We have routines to shake ourselves out of it but the condition persists.”\n“Our ancestors have had this problem for a long time,” he said.\n“It was different before the spice,” she said.\n“But they lived such short lives.”\n“Fifty, one hundred years; that doesn’t seem very long to us, but still...”\n“Did they compress more into the available time?”\n“Oh, they were frenetic at times.”\nShe was giving him observations from her Other Memories, he realized. Not the first time he had shared in such ancient lore. His mother had produced such memories on occasion, but always as a lesson. Was Taraza doing that now? Teaching him something?\n“Melange is a many-handed monster,” she said.\n“Do you sometimes wish we had never found it?”\n“The Bene Gesserit would not exist without it.”\n“Nor the Guild.”\n“But there would have been no Tyrant, no Muad’Dib. The spice gives with one hand and takes with all of its others.”\n“Which hand contains that which we desire?” he asked. “Isn't that always the question?”\n“You're an oddity, you know that, Miles? Mentats so seldom dip into philosophy. | think it’s one of your strengths. You are supremely able to doubt.”\nHe shrugged. This turn in the conversation disturbed him.\n“You are not amused,” she said. “But cling to your doubts anyway. Doubt is necessary to a philosopher.”\n“So the Zensunni assure us.”\n“All mystics agree on it, Miles. Never underestimate the power of doubts. Very persuasive. S’tori holds up doubt and surety in a single hand.”\nReally quite surprised, he asked: “Do Reverend Mothers practice Zensunni rituals?” He had never even suspected this before.\n“Just once,” she said. “We achieve an exalted form of s’tori, total. It involves every cell.”\n“The spice agony,” he said.\n“I was sure your mother told you. Obviously, she never explained the affinity with the Zensunni.”\nTeg swallowed past a lump in his throat. Fascinating! She gave him a new insight into the Bene Gesserit. This changed his entire concept, including his image of his own mother. They were removed from him into an unattainable place where he could never follow. They might think of him as a comrade on occasion but he could never enter the intimate circle. He could simulate, no more. He would never be like Muad’Dib or the Tyrant.\n“Prescience,” Taraza said.\nThe word shifted his attention. She had changed the subject but not changed it.\n“I was thinking about Muad’Dib,” he said.\n“You think he predicted the future,” she said.\n“That is the Mentat teaching.”\n“I hear the doubt in your voice, Miles. Did he predict or did he create? Prescience can be deadly. The people who demand that the oracle predict for them really want to know next year’s price on whalefur or something equally mundane. None of them wants an instant-by-instant prediction of his personal life.”\n“No surprises,” Teg said.\n“Exactly. If you possessed such fore-knowledge, your life would become an unutterable bore.”\n“You think Muad’Dib’s life was a bore?”\n“And the Tyrant’s, too. We think their entire lives were devoted to trying to break out of chains they themselves created.”\n“But they believed...”\n“Remember your philosopher’s doubts, Miles. Beware! The mind of the believer stagnates. It fails to grow outward into an unlimited, infinite universe.”\nTeg sat silently for a moment. He sensed the fatigue that had been driven beyond his immediate awareness by the drink, sensed also the way his thoughts were roiled by the\nintrusion of new concepts. These were things that he had been taught would weaken a Mentat, yet he felt strengthened by them.\nShe is teaching me, he thought. There is a lesson here.\nAs though projected into his mind and outlined there in fire, he found his entire Mentat-attention fixated on the Zensunni admonition that was taught to every beginning student in the Mentat School:\nBy your belief in granular singularities, you deny all movement—evolutionary or devolutionary. Belief fixes a granular universe and causes that universe to persist. Nothing can be allowed to change because that way your non-moving universe vanishes. But it moves of itself when you do not move. It evolves beyond you and is no longer accessible to you.\n“The oddest thing of all,” Taraza said, sinking into tune with this mood she had created, “is that the scientists of Ix cannot see how much their own beliefs dominate their universe.”\nTeg stared at her, silent and receptive.\n“Ixian beliefs are perfectly submissive to the choices they make on how they will look at their universe,” Taraza said. “Their universe does not act of itself but performs according to the kinds of experiments they choose.”\nWith a start, Teg came out of the memories and awoke to find himself in the Gammu Keep. He still sat in the familiar chair in his workroom. A glance around the room showed nothing moved from where he had put it. Only a few minutes had passed but the room and its contents no longer were alien. He dipped into and out of Mentat mode.
