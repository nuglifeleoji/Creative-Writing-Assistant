�多年精心培养的接班人——接他自己班的人。但由于田福军从省上“杀”回来，高凤阁没有当成专员，当然就更当不成地委书记了。苗凯调离后，高凤阁窝着一肚子不舒服，便开始在暗中鼓动苗凯手上用过的一些对田福军心怀不满的人，大量给田福军制造“罪证”…… \n　　起先的时候，省委并没有特别重视有关田福军的这些告状信。根据一贯的经验，一位新任领导免不了要遭受一些人的反对。后来，告状信越来越多。同时兼任省纪委书记的省委常务副书记吴斌，便指示省纪委派人到黄原去调查田福军的问题。当然，苗凯同志也给这位老上级耳朵里灌了不少田福军的情况”。 \n　　但省纪委的人没有调查出田福军的什么大问题；许多告他的信纯属凭空捏造。事情随之也就不了了之。可是，告田福军的信仍然有增无减；而且后来的告状信都直接寄给了省委书记乔伯年的办公室。 \n　　本来，省委书记乔伯年这两年对南北山区几个地区的工作，还是较为满意的。这些地区大部分都实行了生产责任制。一两年来，实际成果说服了许多怀疑论者。那些地区大规模生产方式的改变，极大地刺激了农民的生产积极性，初步改变了极度贫困的生活状况，使大部分群众解决了基本的温饱问题。 \n　　当然，“冒尖户”还是少数。眼下并不象某些满怀热情的作家用肤浅的文艺作品所宣扬的那样，似乎农民都发了财，动不动就把电视机抱回了家。我们的农民艰难，我们还不清楚吗？他们过去在某种程度上已经穷到了骨头里；新政策的优越性不可能在两年内就把所有人都变成大富翁。对于大多数农民来说，解决了吃饭问题，这就是一件多么了不起的事啊！一切都还是刚刚开头，许许多多的新问题和新矛盾接踵而来，需要迅速而有力地给予解决。 \n　　但是，省委书记感到，这两年来，党的某些基层组织和它的负责人，本身在认识方面都不同程度地存在着一些因循守旧的观念。改革的阻力由此可想而知。毫无疑问，我国整个农村的进步乃至最终走上现代化的道路，有待于一个长时期不断改革的艰难过程。 \n　　无论如何，这个省的南北山区已经迈出了令人鼓舞的一步，并以此昭示了未来多方面的广阔的发展前景——这是任何眼睛没瞎的人都能看得见的。应当指出，在这一方面，最贫困的黄原地区走在了全省的前列；这当然和地委书记田福军同志大胆解放思想是分不开的。 \n　　可是，偏偏他的告状信最多！ \n　　唉，中国呀！什么时候才能把那些诸如“人怕出名猪怕壮”、“枪打出头鸟”、“出头\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福军<|>PERSON<|>田福军 is a political figure who faced
