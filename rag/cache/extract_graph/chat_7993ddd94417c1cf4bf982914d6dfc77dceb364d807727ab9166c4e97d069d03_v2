Did the Bene Gesserit think their design inscrutable? Let her meet a greater power. She thought herself so strong! But the Bene Gesserit could not really know how the Almighty guarded the future of the Shariat!\nTuek was not to be stopped. “It assaults everything we hold sacred! And it’s being spread everywhere!”\n“By the Tleilaxu,” Odrade said.\nWaff lifted his sleeves, directing his weapons at Tuek. He hesitated only because he saw that Odrade had recognized part of his intentions.\nTuek stared from one to the other. Was Odrade’s accusation true? Or was that just another Bene Gesserit trick?\nOdrade saw Waff’s hesitation and guessed its reason. She cast through her mind, seeking an answer to his motivations. What advantage could the Tleilaxu gain by killing Tuek? Obviously, Waff aimed to substitute one of his Face Dancers for the High Priest. But what would that gain him?\nSparring for time, Odrade said: “You should be very cautious, Ambassador Waff.”\n“When has caution ever governed great necessities?” Waff asked.\nTuek lifted himself to his feet and moved heavily to one side, wringing his hands. “Please! These are holy precincts. It is wrong to discuss heresies here unless we plan to destroy them.” He looked down on Waff. “It’s not true, is it? You are not the authors of that terrible document?”\n“It is not ours,” Waff agreed. Damn that fop of a priest! Tuek had moved well to one side and once more presented a moving target.\n“I knew it!” Tuek said, striding around behind Waff and Odrade.\nOdrade kept her gaze on Waff. He planned murder! She was sure of it.\nTuek spoke from behind her. “You do not know how you wrong us, Reverend Mother. Ser Waff has asked that we form a melange cartel. | explained that our price to you must remain unchanged because one of you was the grandmother of God.”\nWaff bowed his head, waiting. The priest would come back into range. God would not permit a failure.\nTuek stood behind Odrade looking down at Waff. A shudder passed through the priest. Tleilaxu were so...SO repellent and amoral. They could not be trusted. How could Waff’s denial be accepted?\nNot wavering from her contemplation of Waff, Odrade said: “But, M’Lord Tuek, was not the prospect of increased income attractive to you?” She saw Waff’s right arm come around slightly, almost aimed at her. His intentions became Clear.\n“M’Lord Tuek,” Odrade said, “this Tleilaxu intends to murder us both.”\nAt her words, Waff jerked both arms up, trying to aim at the two separated and difficult targets. Before his muscles responded, Odrade was under his guard. She heard the faint hiss of dart throwers but felt no sting. Her left arm came up in a Slashing blow to break Waff’s right arm. Her right foot broke his left arm.\nWaff screamed.\nHe had never suspected such speed in the Bene Gesserit. It was almost a match for what he had seen in the Honored Matre on the Ixian conference ship. Even through his pain he realized that he must report this. Reverend Mothers command synaptic bypasses under duress!\nThe door behind Odrade burst open. Waff’s Face Dancers rushed into the chamber. But Odrade already was behind Waff, both hands on his throat. “Stop or he dies!” she shouted.\nThe two froze.\nWaff squirmed under her hands.\n“Be still!” she commanded. Odrade glanced at Tuek sprawled on the floor to her right. One dart had hit its target.\n“Waff has killed the High Priest,” Odrade said, speaking for her own secret listeners.\nThe two Face Dancers continued to stare at her. Their indecision was easy to see. None of them, she saw, had\nrealized how this played into Bene Gesserit hands. Trap the Tleilaxu indeed!\nOdrade spoke to the Face Dancers. “Remove yourselves and that body to the corridor and close the door. Your Master has done a foolish thing. He will have need of you later.” To Waff, she said: “For the moment, you need me more than you need your Face Dancers. Send them away.”\n“Go,” Waff squeaked.\nWhen the Face Dancers continued to stare at her, Odrade said: “If you do not leave immediately, | will kill him and then | will dispatch both of you.”\n“Do it!” Waff screamed.\nThe Face Dancers took this as the command to obey their Master. Odrade heard something else in Waff’s voice. He obviously would have to be talked out of suicidal hysteria.\nOnce she was alone with him, Odrade removed the exhausted weapons from his sleeves and pocketed them. They could be examined in detail later. There was little she could do for his broken bones except render him briefly unconscious and set them. She improvised splints from cushions and torn strips of green fabric from the High Priest’s furnishings.\nWaff reawakened quickly. He groaned when he looked at Odrade.\n“You and | are now allies,” Odrade said. “The things that have transpired in this chamber have been heard by some of my people and by representatives from a faction that wants to replace Tuek with one of their own number.”\nIt was too fast for Waff. He was a moment grasping what she had said. His mind fastened, though, on the most important thing.\n“Allies?”\n“| imagine Tuek was difficult to deal with,” she said. “Offer him obvious benefits and he invariably waffled. You have done some of the priests a favor by killing him.”\n“They are listening now?” Waff squeaked.\n“Of course. Let us discuss your proposed spice monopoly. The late lamented High Priest said you mentioned this. Let me see if | can deduce the extent of your offer.”\n“My arms,” Waff moaned.\n“You're still alive,” she said. “Be thankful for my wisdom. | could have killed you.”\nHe turned his head away from her. “That would have been better.”\n“Not for the Bene Tleilax and certainly not for my Sisterhood,” she said. “Let me see. Yes, you promised to provide Rakis with many new spice harvesters, the new airborne ones, which only touch the desert with their sweeper heads.”\n“You listened!” Waff accused.\n“Not at all. A very attractive proposal, since I’m sure the Ixians are providing them free for their own reasons. Shall | continue?”\n“You said we are allies.”\n“A monopoly would force the Guild to buy more Ixian navigation machines,” she said. “You would have the Guild in the jaws of your crusher.”\nWaff lifted his head to glare at her. The movement sent agony through his broken arms and he groaned. Despite the pain, he studied Odrade through almost lidded eyes. Did the witches really believe that was the extent of the Tleilaxu plan? He hardly dared hope the Bene Gesserit were so misled.\n“Of course that was not your basic plan,” Odrade said.\nWaff’s eyes snapped wide open. She was reading his mind! “I am dishonored,” he said. “When you saved my life you saved a useless thing.” He sank back.\nOdrade inhaled a deep breath. Time to use the results of the Chapter House analyses. She leaned close to Waff and whispered in his ear: “The Shariat needs you yet.”\nWaff gasped.\nOdrade sat back. That gasp said it all. Analysis confirmed.\n“You thought you had better allies in the people from the Scattering,” she said. “Those Honored Matres and other hetairas of that ilk. | ask you: does the slig make alliance with its garbage?”\nWaff had heard that question uttered only in khel. His face pale, he breathed in shallow gasps. The implications in her words! He forced himself to ignore the pain in his arms. Allies, she said. She knew about the Shariat! How could she possibly know?\n“How can either of us be unmindful of the many advantages in an alliance between Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit?” Odrade asked.\nAlliance with the powindah witches? Waff’s mind was filled with turmoil. The agony of his arms was held so tentatively at bay. This moment felt so fragile! He tasted acid bile on the back of his tongue.\n“Ahhhh,” Odrade said. “Do you hear that? The priest, Krutansik, and his faction have arrived outside our door. They will propose that one of your Face Dancers assume the guise of the late Hedley Tuek. Any other course would cause too much turmoil. Krutansik is a fairly wise man who has held himself in the background until now. His Uncle Stiros groomed him well.”\n“What does your Sisterhood gain from alliance with us?” Waff managed.\nOdrade smiled. Now she could speak the truth. That was always much easier and often the most powerful argument.\n“Our survival in the face of the storm that is brewing among the Scattered Ones,” she said. “Tleilaxu survival, too. The farthest thing from our desires is an end to those who preserve the Great Belief.”\nWaff cringed. She spoke it openly! Then he understood. What matter if others heard? They could not see through to the secrets beneath her words.\n“Our breeding mothers are ready for you,” Odrade said. She stared hard into his eyes and made the handsign of a\nZensunni priest.\nWaff felt a tight band release itself from his breast. The unexpected, the unthinkable, the unbelievable thing was true! The Bene Gesserit were not powindah! All the universe would yet follow the Bene Tleilax into the True Faith! God would not permit otherwise. Especially not here on the planet of the Prophet!\nBureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top of the heap look inept.

Except for the night watch and essential services, Chapter House Core Slumbered around her. Only the familiar sounds of maintenance activities penetrated her private chambers. Two glowglobes hovered over her table, bathing the dark wood surface and rows of ridulian paper in yellow light. The window beyond her table was a dark mirror reflecting the room.\nArchives!\nThe holoprojector flickered with its continuing production above the tabletop—more bits and pieces that she had summoned.\nTaraza rather distrusted Archivists, which she knew was an ambivalent attitude because she recognized the underlying necessity for data. But Chapter House Records could only be viewed as a jungle of abbreviations, special notations, coded insertions, and footnotes. Such material often required a Mentat for translation or, what was worse, in times of extreme fatigue demanded that she delve into Other Memories. All Archivists were Mentats, of course, but this did not reassure Taraza. You could never consult Archival Records in a straightforward manner.
