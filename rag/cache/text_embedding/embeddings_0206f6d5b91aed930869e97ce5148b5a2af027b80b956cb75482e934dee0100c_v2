gift?”\n“It was explained to me, my Lord.”\nPaul sat back, hands resting on the arms of the throne.\nWhat debt do I owe Duncan’s flesh? he wondered. The man died saving my life. But this is not Idaho, this is a ghola. Yet, here were body and mind which had taught Paul to fly a ‘thopter as though the wings grew from his own shoulders. Paul knew he could not pick up a sword without leaning on the harsh education Idaho had given him. A ghola. This was flesh full of false impressions, easily misread. Old associations would persist. Duncan Idaho. It wasn’t so much a mask the ghola wore as it was a loose, concealing garment of personality which moved in a way different from whatever the Tleilaxu had hidden here.\n“How might you serve us?” Paul asked.\n“In any way my Lord’s wishes and my capabilities agree.”\nAlia, watching from her vantage point, was touched by the ghola’s air of diffidence. She detected nothing feigned. Something ultimately innocent shone from the new Duncan Idaho. The original had been worldly, devil-may-care. But this flesh had been cleansed of all that. It was a pure surface upon which the Tleilaxu had written... what?\nShe sensed the hidden perils in this gift then. This was a Tleilaxu thing. The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist.\nPaul stirred, looked at Edric. “How has this g/ft been trained?” he asked.\n“If it please my Lord,” Edric said, “it amused the Tleilaxu to train this ghola as a mentat and philosopher of the Zensunni. Thus, they sought to increase his abilities with the sword.”\n“Did they succeed?”\n“I do not know, my Lord.”\nPaul weighed the answer. Truthsense told him Edric sincerely believed the ghola to be Idaho. But there was more. The waters of Time through which this oracular Steersman moved suggested dangers without revealing them. Hayt. The Tleilaxu name spoke of peril. Paul felt himself tempted to reject the gift. Even as he felt the temptation, he knew he couldn’t choose that way. This flesh made demands on House Atreides—a fact the enemy well knew.\n“Zensunni philosopher,” Paul mused, once more looking at the ghola. “You’ve examined your own role and motives?”\n“I approach my service in an attitude of humility, Sire. | am a cleansed mind washed free of the imperatives from my human past.”\n“Would you prefer we called you Hayt or Duncan Idaho?”\n“My Lord may call me what he wishes, for! am nota name.”\n“But do you enjoy the name Duncan Idaho?”\n“I think that was my name, Sire. It fits within me. Yet... it stirs up Curious responses. One’s name, | think, must carry much that’s unpleasant along with the pleasant.”\n“What gives you the most pleasure?” Paul asked.\nUnexpectedly, the ghola laughed, said: “Looking for signs in others which reveal my former self.”\n“Do you see such signs here?”\n“Oh, yes, my Lord. Your man Stilgar there is caught between suspicion and admiration. He was friend to my former self, but this ghola flesh repels him. You, my Lord, admired the man I was . . . and you trusted him.”\n“Cleansed mind,” Paul said. “How can a cleansed mind put itself in bondage to us?”\n“Bondage, my Lord? The cleansed mind makes decisions in the presence of unknowns and without cause and effect. Is this bondage?”\nPaul scowled. It was a Zensunni saying, cryptic, apt— immersed in a creed which denied objective function in all mental activity. Without cause and effect! Such thoughts shocked the mind. Unknowns? Unknowns lay in every decision, even in the oracular vision.\n“You'd prefer we called you Duncan Idaho?” Paul asked.\n“We live by differences, my Lord. Choose a name for me.”\n“Let your Tleilaxu name stand,” Paul said. “Hayt—there’s a name inspires caution.”\nHayt bowed, moved back one step.\nAnd Alia wondered: How did he know the interview was over? | knew it because I know my brother. But there was no\nsign a stranger could read. Did the Duncan Idaho in him know?\nPaul turned toward the Ambassador, said: “Quarters have been set aside for your embassy. It is our desire to have a private consultation with you at the earliest opportunity. We will send for you. Let us inform you further, before you hear it from an inaccurate source, that a Reverend Mother of the Sisterhood, Gaius Helen Mohiam, has been removed from the heighliner which brought you. It was done at our command. Her presence on your ship will be an item in our talks.”\nA wave of Paul’s left hand dismissed the envoy. “Hayt,” Paul said, “stay here.”\nThe Ambassador’s attendants backed away, towing the tank. Edric became orange motion in orange gas—eyes, a mouth, gently waving limbs.\nPaul watched until the last Guildsman was gone, the great doors swinging closed behind them.\nI’ve done it now, Paul thought. /’ve accepted the ghola. The Tleilaxu creation was bait, no doubt of it. Very likely the old hag of a Reverend Mother played the same role. But it was the time of the tarot which he’d forecast in an early vision. The damnable tarot! It muddied the waters of Time until the prescient strained to detect moments but an hour off. Many a fish took the bait and escaped, he reminded himself. And the tarot worked for him as well as against him. What he could not see, others might not detect as well.\nThe ghola stood, head cocked to one side, waiting.\nStilgar moved across the steps, hid the ghola from Paul’s view. In Chakobsa, the hunting language of their sietch days, Stilgar said: “That creature in the tank gives me the shudders, Sire, but this gift! Send it away!”\nIn the same tongue, Paul said: “I cannot.”\n“Idaho’s dead,” Stilgar argued. “This isn’t Idaho. Let me take its water for the tribe.”\n“The ghola is my problem, Stil. Your problem is our prisoner. | want the Reverend Mother guarded most carefully by the men | trained to resist the wiles of Voice.”\n“I like this not, Sire.”\n“I'll be cautious, Stil. See that you are, too.”\n“Very well, Sire.” Stilgar stepped down to the floor of the hall, passed close to Hayt, sniffed him and strode out.\nEvil can be detected by its smell, Paul thought. Stilgar had planted the green and white Atreides banner on a dozen worlds, but remained superstitious Fremen, proof against any sophistication.\nPaul studied the gift.\n“Duncan, Duncan,” he whispered. “What have they done to you?”\n“They gave me life, m’Lord,” Hayt said.\n“But why were you trained and given to us?” Paul asked.\nHayt pursed his lips, then: “They intend me to destroy you.”\nThe statement’s candor shook Paul. But then, how else could a Zensunni-mentat respond? Even in a ghola, a mentat could speak no less than the truth, especially out of Zensunni inner calm. This was a human computer, mind and nervous system fitted to the tasks relegated long ago to hated mechanical devices. To condition him also as a Zensunni meant a double ration of honesty ... unless the Tleilaxu had built something even more odd into this flesh.\nWhy, for example, the mechanical eyes? Tleilaxu boasted their metal eyes improved on the original. Strange, then, that more Tleilaxu didn’t wear them out of choice.\nPaul glanced up at Alia’s spy hole, longed for her presence and advice, for counsel not clouded by feelings of responsibility and debt.\nOnce more, he looked at the ghola. This was no frivolous gift. It gave honest answers to dangerous questions.\nIt makes no difference that | know this is a weapon to be used against me, Paul thought.\n“What should | do to protect myself from you?” Paul asked. It was direct speech, no royal “we,” but a question as he might have put it to the old Duncan Idaho.\n“Send me away, m’Lord.”\nPaul shook his head from side to side. “How are you to destroy me?”\nHayt looked at the guards, who’d moved closer to Paul after Stilgar’s departure. He turned, cast his gaze around the hall, brought his metal eyes back to bear on Paul, nodded.\n“This is a place where a man draws away from people,” Hayt said. “It soeaks of such power that one can contemplate it comfortably only in the remembrance that all things are finite. Did my Lord’s oracular powers plot his course into this place?”\nPaul drummed his fingers against the throne’s arms. The mentat sought data, but the question disturbed him. “l came to this position by strong decisions... not always out of my other... abilities.”\n“Strong decisions,” Hayt said. “These temper a man’s life. One can take the temper from fine metal by heating it and allowing it to cool without quenching.”\n“Do you divert me with Zensunni prattle?” Paul asked.\n“Zensunni has other avenues to explore, Sire, than diversion and display.”\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, drew in a deep breath, set his own thoughts into the counterbalance poise of the mentat. Negative answers arose around him. It wasn’t expected that he’d go haring after the ghola to the exclusion of other duties. No, that wasn’t it. Why a Zensunni-mentat? Philosophy... words... contemplation... inward searching... He felt the weakness of his data.\n“We need more data,” he muttered.\n“The facts needed by a mentat do not brush off onto one as you might gather pollen on your robe while passing\nthrough a field of flowers,” Hayt said. “One chooses his pollen carefully, examines it under powerful amplification.”\n“You must teach me this Zensunni way with rhetoric,” Paul said.\nThe metallic eyes glittered at him for a moment, then: “M’ Lord, perhaps that’s what was intended.”\nTo blunt my will with words and ideas? Paul wondered.\n“Ideas are most to be feared when they become actions,” Paul said.\n“Send me away, Sire,” Hayt said, and it was Duncan Idaho’s voice full of concern for “the young master.”\nPaul felt trapped by that voice. He couldn’t send that voice away, even when it came from a ghola. “You will stay,” he said, “and we'll both exercise caution.”\nHayt bowed in submission.\nPaul glanced up at the spy hole, eyes pleading for Alia to take this gift off his hands and ferret out its secrets. Gholas were ghosts to frighten children. He’d never thought to know one. To know this one", ", examines it under powerful amplification.”\n“You must teach me this Zensunni way with rhetoric,” Paul said.\nThe metallic eyes glittered at him for a moment, then: “M’ Lord, perhaps that’s what was intended.”\nTo blunt my will with words and ideas? Paul wondered.\n“Ideas are most to be feared when they become actions,” Paul said.\n“Send me away, Sire,” Hayt said, and it was Duncan Idaho’s voice full of concern for “the young master.”\nPaul felt trapped by that voice. He couldn’t send that voice away, even when it came from a ghola. “You will stay,” he said, “and we'll both exercise caution.”\nHayt bowed in submission.\nPaul glanced up at the spy hole, eyes pleading for Alia to take this gift off his hands and ferret out its secrets. Gholas were ghosts to frighten children. He’d never thought to know one. To know this one, he had to set himself above all compassion... and he wasn’t certain he could do it. Duncan... Duncan . .. Where was Idaho in this shaped-to- measure flesh? It wasn’t flesh... it was a shroud in fleshly Shape! Idaho lay dead forever on the floor of an Arrakeen cavern. His ghost stared out of metal eyes. Two beings stood side by side in this revenant flesh. One was a threat with its force and nature hidden behind unique veils.\nClosing his eyes, Paul allowed old visions to sift through his awareness. He sensed the spirits of love and hate spouting there in a rolling sea from which no rock lifted above the chaos. No place at all from which to survey turmoil.\nWhy has no vision shown me this new Duncan Idaho? he asked himself. What concealed Time from an oracle? Other oracles, obviously.\nPaul opened his eyes, asked: “Hayt, do you have the power of prescience?”\n“No, m’Lord.”\nSincerity spoke in that voice. It was possible the ghola didn’t know he possessed this ability, of course. But that’d hamper his working as a mentat. What was the hidden design?\nOld visions surged around Paul. Would he have to choose the terrible way? Distorted Time hinted at this ghola in that hideous future. Would that way close in upon him no matter what he did?\nDisengage... disengage... disengage...\nThe thought tolled in his mind.\nIn her position above Paul, Alia sat with chin cupped in left hand, stared down at the ghola. A magnetic attraction about this Hayt reached up to her. Tleilaxu restoration had given him youth, an innocent intensity which called out to her. She’d understood Paul’s unspoken plea. When oracles failed, one turned to real spies and physical powers. She wondered, though, at her own eagerness to accept this challenge. She felt a positive desire to be near this new man, perhaps to touch him.\nHe’s a danger to both of us, she thought.\nTruth suffers from too much analysis.\n—ANCIENT FREMEN SAYING\nll Pe veren Mother, I shudder to see you in such circumstances,” Irulan said.\nShe stood just inside the cell door, measuring the various capacities of the room in her Bene Gesserit way. It was a three-meter cube carved with cutterays from the veined brown rock beneath Paul’s Keep. For furnishings, it contained one flimsy basket chair occupied now by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, a pallet with a brown cover upon which had been spread a deck of the new Dune Tarot cards, a metered water tap above a reclamation basin, a Fremen privy with moisture seals. It was all sparse, primitive. Yellow light came from anchored and caged glowglobes at the four corners of the ceiling.\n“You’ve sent word to the Lady Jessica?” the Reverend Mother asked.\n“Yes, but | don’t expect her to lift one finger against her firstborn,” Irulan said. She glanced at the cards. They spoke of the powerful turning their backs on supplicants. The card of the Great Worm lay beneath Desolate Sand. Patience was counseled. Did one require the tarot to see this? she asked herself.\nA guard stood outside watching them through a metaglass window in the door. Irulan knew there’d be other monitors on this encounter. She had put in much thought and planning before daring to come here. To have stayed away carried its own perils, though.\nThe Reverend Mother had been engaged in prajna meditation interspersed with examinations of the tarot.\nDespite a feeling that she would never leave Arrakis alive, she had achieved a measure of calm through this. One’s oracular powers might be small, but muddy water was muddy water. And there was always the Litany Against Fear.\nShe had yet to assimilate the import of the actions which had precipitated her into this cell. Dark suspicions brooded in her mind (and the tarot hinted at confirmations). Was it possible the Guild had planned this?\nA yellow-robed Qizara, head shaved for a turban, beady eyes of total blue in a bland round face, skin leathered by the wind and sun of Arrakis, had awaited her on the heighliner’s reception bridge. He had looked up from a bulb of spice-coffee being served by an obsequious steward, studied her a moment, put down the coffee bulb.\n“You are the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?”\nTo replay those words in her mind was to bring that moment alive in the memory. Her throat had constricted with an unmanageable spasm of fear. How had one of the Emperor’s minions learned of her presence on the heighliner?\n“It came to our attention that you were aboard,” the Qizara said. “Have you forgotten that you are denied permission to set foot on the holy planet?”\n“Lam not on Arrakis,” she said. “I’m a passenger ona Guild heighliner in free space.”\n“There is no such thing as free space, Madame.”\nShe read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone.\n“Muad’Dib rules everywhere,” he said.\n“Arrakis is not my destination,” she insisted.\n“Arrakis is the destination of everyone,” he said. And she feared for a moment that he would launch into a recital of the mystical itinerary which pilgrims followed. (This very ship had carried thousands of them.)\nBut the Qizara had pulled a golden amulet from beneath his robe, kissed it, touched it to his forehead and placed it to\nhis right ear, listened. Presently, he restored the amulet to its hidden place.\n“You are ordered to gather your luggage and accompany me to Arrakis.”\n“But | have business elsewhere!”\nIn that moment, she suspected Guild perfidy ... or exposure through some transcendant power of the Emperor or his sister. Perhaps the Steersman did not conceal the conspiracy, after all. The abomination, Alia, certainly possessed the abilities of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. What happened when those powers were coupled with the forces which worked in her brother?\n“At once!” the Qizara snapped.\nEverything in her cried out against setting foot once more on that accursed desert planet. Here was where the Lady Jessica had turned against the Sisterhood. Here was where they’d lost Paul Atreides, the kwisatz haderach they’d sought through long generations of careful breeding.\n“At once,” she agreed.\n“There’s little time,” the Qizara said. “When the Emperor commands, all his subjects obey.”\nSo the order had come from Paul!\nShe thought of protesting to the heighliner’s Navigator- Commander, but the futility of such a gesture stopped her. What could the Guild do?\n“The Emperor has said | must die if | set foot on Dune,” she said, making a last desperate effort. “You spoke of this yourself. You are condemning me if you take me down there.”\n“Say no more,” the Qizara ordered. “The thing is ordained.”\nThat was how they always spoke of Imperial commands, she knew. Ordained! The holy ruler whose eyes could pierce the future had spoken. What must be must be. He had seen it, had He not?\nWith the sick feeling that she was caught in a web of her own spinning, she had turned to obey.\nAnd the web had become a cell which Irulan could visit. She saw that Irulan had aged somewhat since their meeting on Wallach IX. New lines of worry spread from the corners of her eyes. Well... time to see if this Sister of the Bene Gesserit could obey her vows.\n“I’ve had worse quarters,” the Reverend Mother said. “Do you come from the Emperor?” And she allowed her fingers to move as though in agitation.\nlrulan read the moving fingers and her own fingers flashed an answer as she spoke, saying: “No—I came as soon as | heard you were here.”\n“Won’t the Emperor be angry?” the Reverend Mother asked. Again, her fingers moved: imperative, pressing, demanding.\n“Let him be angry. You were my teacher in the Sisterhood, just as you were the teacher of his own mother. Does he think | will turn my back on you as she has done?” And lrulan’s finger-talk made excuses, begged.\nThe Reverend Mother sighed. On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan. It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor’s precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument. No matter her beauty, this Princess was flawed. Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions. Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though, and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.\nBeneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister crossbreeding must be explored. (Irulan almost broke at receiving this command.)\n“I must have my chance!” Irulan’s fingers pleaded.\n“You've had your chance,” the Reverend Mother countered. And she was explicit in her instructions: Was the Emperor ever angry with his concubine? His unique powers must make him lonely. To whom could he speak in any hope of being understood? To the sister, obviously. She shared this loneliness. The depth of their communion must be exploited. Opportunities must be created to throw them together in privacy. Intimate encounters must be arranged. The possibility of eliminating the concubine must be explored. Grief dissolved traditional barriers.\nlrulan protested. If Chani were killed, suspicion would fasten immediately upon the Princess-Consort. Besides, there were other problems. Chani had fastened upon an ancient Fremen diet supposed to promote fertility and the diet eliminated all opportunity for administering the contraceptive drugs. Lifting the suppressives would make Chani even more fertile.\nThe Reverend Mother was outraged and concealed it with difficulty while her fingers flashed their demands. Why had this information not been conveyed at the beginning of their conversation? How could Irulan be that stupid? If Chani conceived and bore a son, the Emperor would declare the child his heir!\nlrulan protested that she understood the dangers, but the genes might not be totally lost.\nDamn such stupidity! the Reverend Mother raged. Who knew what suppressions and genetic entanglements Chani might introduce from her wild Fremen strain? The Sisterhood must have only the pure line! And an heir would renew Paul’s ambitions, spur him to new efforts in consolidating his Empire. The conspiracy could not afford such a setback.\nDefensively, Irulan wanted to know how she could have prevented Chani from trying this diet?\nBut the Reverend Mother was in no mood for", " diet eliminated all opportunity for administering the contraceptive drugs.

If Chani conceived, an abortifact must be introduced\ninto her food or drink. Either that, or she must be killed. An heir to the throne from that source must be prevented at all costs.\nAn abortifact would be as dangerous as an open attack on the concubine, Irulan objected. She trembled at the thought of trying to kill Chani.\nWas Irulan deterred by danger? The Reverend Mother wanted to know, her finger-talk conveying deep scorn.\nAngered, Irulan signaled that she knew her value as an agent in the royal household. Did the conspiracy wish to waste such a valuable agent? Was she to be thrown away? In what other way could they keep this close a watch on the Emperor? Or had they introduced another agent into the household? Was that it? Was she to be used now, desperately, and for the last time?\nIn a war, all values acquired new relationships, the Reverend Mother countered. Their greatest peril was that House Atreides should secure itself with an Imperial line. The Sisterhood could not take such a risk. This went far beyond the danger to the Atreides genetic pattern. Let Paul anchor his family to the throne and the Sisterhood could look forward to centuries of disruption for its programs.\nlrulan understood the argument, but she couldn’t escape the thought that a decision had been made to spend the Princess-Consort for something of great value. Was there something she should know about the ghola? Irulan ventured.\nThe Reverend Mother wanted to know if Irulan thought the Sisterhood composed of fools. When had they ever failed to tell Irulan all she should know?\nIt was no answer, but an admission of concealment, Irulan saw. It said she would be told no more than she needed to know.\nHow could they be certain the ghola was capable of destroying the Emperor? Irulan asked.\nShe could just as well have asked if melange were capable of destruction, the Reverend Mother countered.\nIt was a rebuke with a subtle message, Irulan realized. The Bene Gesserit “whip that instructs” informed her that she should have understood long ago this similarity between the spice and the ghola. Melange was valuable, but it exacted a price—addiction. It added years to a life— decades for some—but it was still just another way to die.\nThe ghola was something of deadly value.\nThe obvious way to prevent an unwanted birth was to kill the prospective mother before conception, the Reverend Mother signaled, returning to the attack.\nOf course, Irulan thought. /f you decide to spend a certain sum, get as much for it as you can.\nThe Reverend Mother’s eyes, dark with the blue brilliance of her melange addiction, stared up at Irulan, measuring, waiting, observing minutiae.\nShe reads me clearly, \\rulan thought with dismay. She trained me and observed me in that training. She knows | realize what decision has been taken here. She only observes now to see how I will take this knowledge. Well, | will take it as a Bene Gesserit and a princess.\nlrulan managed a smile, pulled herself erect, thought of the evocative opening passage of the Litany Against Fear:\n“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little- death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear...”\nWhen calmness had returned, she thought: Let them spend me. | will show them what a princess is worth. Perhaps I'll buy them more than they expected.\nAfter a few more empty vocalizations to bind off the interview, Irulan departed.\nWhen she had gone, the Reverend Mother returned to her tarot cards, laying them out in the fire-eddy pattern. Immediately, she got the Kwisatz Haderach of the Major Arcana and the card lay coupled with the Eight of Ships: the sibyl hoodwinked and betrayed. These were not cards of\ngood omen: they spoke of concealed resources for her enemies.\nShe turned away from the cards, sat in agitation, wondering if Irulan might yet destroy them.\nThe Fremen see her as the Earth Figure, a demi-goddess whose special charge is to protect the tribes through her powers of violence. She is Reverend Mother to their Reverend Mothers. To pilgrims who seek her out with demands that she restore virility or make the barren fruitful, she is a form of antimentat. She feeds on that proof that the “analytic” has limits. She represents ultimate tension. She is the virgin-harlot—witty, vulgar, cruel, as destructive in her whims as a coriolis storm.\n—ST. ALIA OF THE KNIFE AS TAKEN FROM THE IRULAN REPORT\nlia stood like a black-robed sentinel figure on the south\nplatform of her temple, the Fane of the Oracle which Paul’s Fremen cohorts had built for her against a wall of his stronghold.\nShe hated this part of her life, but knew no way to evade the temple without bringing down destruction upon them all. The pilgrims (damn them!) grew more numerous every day. The temple’s lower porch was crowded with them. Vendors moved among the pilgrims, and there were minor sorcerers, haruspices, diviners, all working their trade in pitiful imitation of Paul Muad’Dib and his sister.\nRed and green packages containing the new Dune Tarot were prominent among the vendors’ wares, Alia saw. She wondered about the tarot. Who was feeding this device into the Arrakeen market? Why had the tarot sprung to prominence at this particular time and place? Was it to muddy Time? Spice addiction always conveyed some sensitivity to prediction. Fremen were notoriously fey. Was it an accident that so many of them dabbled in portents and omens here and now? She decided to seek an answer at the first opportunity.\nThere was a wind from the southeast, a small leftover wind blunted by the scarp of the Shield Wall which loomed\nhigh in these northern reaches. The rim glowed orange through a thin dust haze underlighted by the late afternoon sun. It was a hot wind against her cheeks and it made her homesick for the sand, for the security of open spaces.\nThe last of the day’s mob began descending the broad greenstone steps of the lower porch, singly and in groups, a few pausing to stare at the keepsakes and holy amulets on the street vendors’ racks, some consulting one last minor sorcerer. Pilgrims, supplicants, townfolk, Fremen, vendors closing up for the day—they formed a straggling line that trailed off into the palm-lined avenue which led to the heart of the city.\nAlia’s eyes picked out the Fremen, marking the frozen looks of superstitious awe on their faces, the half-wild way they kept their distance from the others. They were her strength and her peril. They still captured giant worms for transport, for sport and for sacrifice. They resented the offworld pilgrims, barely tolerated the townfolk of graben and pan, hated the cynicism they saw in the street vendors. One did not jostle a wild Fremen, even in a mob such as the ones which swarmed to Alia’s Fane. There were no knifings in the Sacred Precincts, but bodies had been found... later.\nThe departing swarm had stirred up dust. The flinty odor came to Alia’s nostrils, ignited another pang of longing for the open bled. Her sense of the past, she realized, had been sharpened by the coming of the ghola. There’d been much pleasure in those untrammeled days before her brother had mounted the throne—time for joking, time for small things, time to enjoy a cool morning or a sunset, time...time... time ... Even danger had been good in those days—clean danger from known sources. No need then to strain the limits of prescience, to peer through murky veils for frustrating glimpses of the future.\nWild Fremen said it well: “Four things cannot be hidden— love, smoke, a pillar of fire and a man striding across the open bled.”\nWith an abrupt feeling of revulsion, Alia retreated from the platform into the shadows of the Fane, strode along the balcony which looked down into the glistening opalescence of her Hall of Oracles. Sand on the tiles rasped beneath her feet. Supplicants always tracked sand into the Sacred Chambers! She ignored attendants, guards, postulants, the Qizarate’s omnipresent priest-sycophants, plunged into the Spiral passage which twisted upward to her private quarters. There, amidst divans, deep rugs, tent hangings and mementos of the desert, she dismissed the Fremen amazons Stilgar had assigned as her personal guardians. Watchdogs, more likely! When they had gone, muttering and objecting, but more fearful of her than they were of Stilgar, she stripped off her robe, leaving only the sheathed crysknife on its thong around her neck, strewed garments behind as she made for the bath.\nHe was near, she knew—that shadow-figure of a man she could sense in her future, but could not see. It angered her that no power of prescience could put flesh on that figure. He could be sensed only at unexpected moments while she scanned the lives of others. Or she came upon a smoky outline in solitary darkness when innocence lay coupled with desire. He stood just beyond an unfixed horizon, and she felt that if she strained her talents to an unexpected intensity she might see him. He was there—a constant assault on her awareness: fierce, dangerous, immoral.\nMoist warm air surrounded her in the tub. Here was a habit she had learned from the memory-entities of the uncounted Reverend Mothers who were strung out in her awareness like pearls on a glowing necklace. Water, warm water in a sunken tub, accepted her skin as she slid into it. Green tiles with figures of red fish worked into a sea pattern surrounded the water. Such an abundance of water occupied this space that a Fremen of old would have been outraged to see it used merely for washing human flesh.\nHe was near.\nIt was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend Mother who had presided at the sietch orgies. The tau awareness of her other-se/ves could supply any detail her curiosity required. This feeling of nearness could be nothing other than flesh reaching for flesh.\nNeed for action fought lethargy in the warm water.\nAbruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet and naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom. The chamber, oblong and skylighted, contained the gross and subtle instruments which toned a Bene Gesserit adept"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_0206f6d5b91aed930869e97ce5148b5a2af027b80b956cb75482e934dee0100c_v2"}
