Despite their fearsome origins, they exhibit limited language skills and are primarily used as threats or enforcers by the Honored Matres.  \n\nFutars have been observed interacting with high-ranking figures such as the **Great Honored Matre** and **Lucilla**, suggesting they play a role in the Matres' operations, whether as tools of intimidation or as remnants of a failed experiment turned against their creators. Recently sighted on **Gammu**, their presence underscores the Honored Matres' dominance over these once-dangerous beings.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing their engineered origins, others their subjugation—the consensus is that Futars are formidable yet controlled creatures, repurposed by their former prey.
