Far out on the sands beyond the sight of Keen or any other inhabited place, the worms came to her. Sheeana alone in front of a worm talked to it while others listened. Tamalane found the accumulated recordings fascinating as they passed through her hands on their way to Chapter House.\n“I should hate you!”\nWhat a turmoil that caused among the priests! Tuek wanted an open debate: “Should all of us hate the Divided God at the same time we love Him?”\nStiros barely shut off this suggestion with the argument that God’s wishes had not been made clear.\nSheeana asked one of her gigantic visitors: “Will you let me ride you again?”\nWhen she approached, the worm retreated and would not let her mount.\nOn another occasion, she asked: “Must | stay with the priests?”\nThis particular worm proved to be the target of many questions, and among them:\n“Where do people go when you eat them?”\n“Why are people false to me?”\n“Should | punish the bad priests?”\nTamalane laughed at that final question, thinking of the turmoil it would cause among Tuek’s people. Her spies duly reported the dismay of the priests.\n“How does He answer her?” Tuek asked. “Has anyone heard God respond?”\n“Perhaps He speaks directly into her soul,” a councillor ventured.\n“That’s it!” Tuek leaped at this offering. “We must ask her what God tells her to do.”\nSheeana refused to be drawn into such discussions.\n“She has a pretty fair assessment of her powers,” Tamalane reported. “She’s not going into the desert very much now despite Stiros’ proddings. As we might expect, the attraction has waned. Fear and elation will carry her just so far before paling. She has, however, learned an effective command:\n“Go away!”\nThe Sisterhood marked this as an important development. When even the Divided God obeyed, no priest or priestess was about to question her authority to issue such a command.\n“The priests are building towers in the desert,” Tamalane reported. “They want more secure places from which to observe Sheeana when she does go out there.”\nThe Sisterhood had anticipated this development and had even done some of its own prodding to speed up the projects. Each tower had its own windtrap, its own maintenance staff, its own water barrier, gardens and other elements of civilization. Each was a small community spreading the established areas of Rakis farther and farther into the domain of the worms.\nPioneer villages no longer were necessary and Sheeana got the credit for this development.\n“She is our priestess,” the populace said.\nTuek and his councillors spun on the point of a pin: Shaitan and Shai-hulud in one body? Stiros lived in daily fear that Tuek would announce the fact. Stiros’ advisors finally rejected the suggestion that Tuek be translated. Another suggestion that Priestess Sheeana have a fatal accident was greeted with horror by all, even Stiros finding it too great a venture.\n“Even if we remove this thorn, God may visit us with an even more terrible intrusion,” he said. And he warned: “The oldest books say that a little child shall lead us.”\nStiros was only the most recent among those who looked upon Sheeana as something not quite mortal. It was observable that those around her, Cania included, had come to love Sheeana. She was so ingenuous, so bright and responsive.\nMany observed that this growing affection for Sheeana extended even to Tuek.\nFor the people touched by this power, the Sisterhood had an immediate recognition. The Bene Gesserit knew a label for this ancient effect: expanding worship. Tamalane reported profound changes moving through Rakis as people everywhere on the planet began praying to Sheeana instead of to Shaitan or even to Shai-hulud.\n“They see that Sheeana intercedes for the weakest people,” Tamalane reported. “It is a familiar pattern. All goes as ordered. When do you send the ghola?”\nThe outer surface of a balloon is always larger than the center of the damned thing! That’s the whole point of the Scattering!\n—BENE GESSERIT RESPONSE TO AN IXIAN SUGGESTION THAT NEW INVESTIGATIVE PROBES BE SENT OUT AMONG THE LOST ONES\nO ne of the Sisterhood’s swifter lighters took Miles Teg up to the Guild Transport circling Gammu. He did not like leaving the Keep at this moment but the priorities were obvious. He also had a gut reaction about this venture. In his three centuries of experience, Teg had learned to trust his gut reactions. Matters were not going well on Gammu. Every patrol, every report of remote sensors, the accounts of Patrin’s spies in the cities—everything fueled Teg’s disquiet.\nMentat fashion, Teg felt the movement of forces around the Keep and within it. His ghola charge was threatened. The order for him to report aboard the Guild Transport prepared for violence, however, came from Taraza herself with an unmistakable crypto-identifier on it.\nOn the lighter taking him upward, Teg set himself for battle. Those preparations he could make had been made. Lucilla was warned. He felt confident about Lucilla. Schwangyu was another matter. He fully intended to discuss with Taraza a few essential changes in the Gammu Keep. First, though, he had another battle to win. Teg had not the slightest doubt that he was entering combat.\nAs his lighter moved in to dock, Teg looked out a port and saw the gigantic Ixian symbol within the Guild cartouche on the Transport’s dark side. This was a ship the Guild had converted to Ixian mechanism, substituting machines for the traditional navigator. There would be Ixian technicians\naboard to service the equipment. A genuine Guild navigator would be there, too. The Guild had never quite learned to trust a machine even while they paraded these converted Transports as a message to Tleilaxu and Rakians.\n“You see: we do not absolutely require your melange!”\nThis was the announcement contained in that giant symbol of Ix on the spaceship’s side.\nTeg felt the slight lurch of the docking grapples and took a deep, quieting breath. He felt as he always did just before battle: Empty of all false dreams. This was a failure. The talking had failed and now came the contest of blood... unless he could prevail in some other way. Combat these days was seldom a massive thing but death was there nonetheless. That represented a more permanent kind of failure. /f we cannot adjust our differences peacefully we are less than human.\nAn attendant with the unmistakable signs of Ix in his speech guided Teg to the room where Taraza waited. All along the corridors and in the pneumotubes carrying him to Taraza, Teg looked for signs to confirm the secret warning in the Mother Superior’s message. All seemed serene and ordinary—the attendant properly deferential toward the Bashar. “I was a Tireg commander at Andioyu,” the attendant said, naming one of the almost-battles where Teg had prevailed.\nThey came to an ordinary oval hatch in the wall of an ordinary corridor. The hatch opened and Teg entered a white-walled room of comfortable dimensions—sling chairs, low side tables, glowglobes tuned to yellow. The hatch slid into its seals behind him with a solid thump, leaving his guide behind him in the corridor.\nA Bene Gesserit acolyte parted the gossamer hangings that concealed a passage on Teg’s right. She nodded to him. He had been seen. Taraza would be notified.\nTeg suppressed a trembling in his calf muscles.\nViolence?\nHe had not misinterpreted Taraza’s secret warning. Were his preparations adequate? There was a black sling chair at his left, a long table in front of it and another chair at the end of the table. Teg went to this side of the room and waited with his back to the wall. The brown dust of Gammu still clung to his boot toes, he noted.\nPeculiar smell in the room. He sniffed. Shere! Had Taraza and her people armed themselves against an Ixian Probe? Teg had taken his usual shere capsule before embarking on the lighter. Too much knowledge in his head that might be useful to an enemy. The fact that Taraza left the smell of shere around her quarters had another implication: It was a statement to some observer whose presence she could not prevent.\nTaraza entered through the gossamer hangings. She appeared tired, he thought. He found this remarkable because the Sisters were capable of concealing fatigue until almost ready to drop. Was she actually low in energy or was this another gesture for hidden observers?\nPausing just into the room, Taraza studied Teg. The Bashar appeared much older than when she had last seen him, Taraza thought. Duty on Gammu was having its effect, but she found this reassuring. Teg was doing his job.\n“Your quick response is appreciated, Miles,” she said.\nAppreciated! Their agreed word for “We are being watched secretly by a dangerous foe.”\nTeg nodded while his gaze went to the hangings where Taraza had entered.\nTaraza smiled and moved farther into the room. No signs of the melange cycle in Teg, she observed. Teg’s advanced years always raised the suspicion that he might resort to the leavening effect of the spice. Nothing about him revealed even the faintest hint of the melange addiction that even the strongest sometimes turned to when they felt their end approaching. Teg wore his old uniform jacket of Supreme Bashar but without the gold starbursts at shoulder and\ncollar. This was a signal she recognized. He said: “Remember how | earned this in your service. | have not failed you this time, either.”\nThe eyes that studied her were level; no hint of judgment escaped them. His entire appearance spoke of quiet within, everything at variance with what she knew must be occurring in him at this moment. He awaited her signal.\n“Our ghola must be awakened at the first opportunity,” she said. She waved a hand to silence him as he started to respond. “I have seen Lucilla’s reports and | know he is too young. But we are required to act.”\nShe spoke for the watchers, he realized. Were her words to be believed?\n“I now give you the order to awaken him,” she said and she flexed her left wrist in the confirmation gesture of their secret language.\nIt was true! Teg glanced at the hangings that concealed the passage where Taraza had entered. Who was it listening there?\nHe put his Mentat talents to the problem. There were missing pieces but that did not stop him. A Mentat could work without certain pieces if he had enough to create a pattern. Sometimes, the sketchiest outline was enough. It supplied the hidden shape and then he could fit the missing pieces to complete a whole. Mentats seldom had all the data they might desire, but he was trained to sense patterns, to recognize systems and wholeness. Teg reminded himself now that he also had been trained in the ultimate military sense: You trained a recruit to traina weapon, to aim the weapon correctly.\nTaraza was aiming him. His assessment of their situation had been confirmed.\n“Desperate attempts will be made to kill or capture our ghola before you can awaken him,” she said.\nHe recognized her tone: the coldly analytic offering of data to a Mentat. She saw that he was in Mentat mode,\nthen.\nThe Mentat pattern-search rolled through his mind. First, there was the Sisterhood’s design for the ghola, largely unknown to him,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young girl who can summon and communicate with sandworms, revered by the priests and people of Rakis as a priestess or even a divine figure.
