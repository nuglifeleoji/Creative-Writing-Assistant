To speak of religion was, of course, why they’d risked bringing The Preacher here.\n“Then speak from this religion,” Farad’n said.\n“As My Prince commands.” He turned, looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled\ninto the path which House Corrino would follow. “Church and state, My Prince, even scientific reason and faith, and even more: progress and tradition—all of these are reconciled in the teachings of Muad’Dib. He taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and, sometimes, in their dreams. One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole.”\nIn spite of doubts which he could not dispel, Farad’n found himself impressed by these words. He heard a note of reluctant sincerity in Tyekanik’s voice, as though the man spoke against inner compulsions.\n“And that’s why you bring me this . .. this interpreter of dreams?”\n“Yes, My Prince. Perhaps your dream penetrates Time. You win back your consciousness of your inner being when you recognize the universe as a coherent whole. Your dreams... well...”\n“But | spoke idly of my dreams,” Farad’n protested. “They are a curiosity, no more. | never once suspected that you...”\n“My Prince, nothing you do can be unimportant.”\n“That’s very flattering, Tyvek. Do you really believe this fellow can see into the heart of great mysteries?”\n“I do, My Prince.”\n“Then let my mother be displeased.”\n“You will see him?”\n“Of course—since you've brought him to displease my mother.”\nDoes he mock me? Tyekanik wondered. And he said: “| must warn you that the old man wears a mask. It is an Ixian device which enables the sightless to see with their skin.”\n“He is blind?”\n“Yes, My Prince.”\n“Does he know who | am?”\n“I told him, My Prince.”\n“Very well. Let us go to him.”\n“If My Prince will wait a moment here, | will bring the man to him.”\nFarad’n looked around the fountain garden, smiled. As good a place as any for this foolishness. “Have you told him what | dreamed?”\n“Only in general terms, My Prince. He will ask you fora personal accounting.”\n“Oh, very well. l'II wait here. Bring the fellow.”\nFarad’n turned his back, heard Tyekanik retire in haste. A gardener could be seen working just beyond the hedge, the top of a brown-capped head, the flashing of shears poking above the greenery. The movement was hypnotic.\nThis dream business is nonsense, Farad’n thought. /t was wrong of Tyek to do this without consulting me. Strange that Tyek should get religion at his age. And now it’s dreams.\nPresently he heard footsteps behind him. Tyekanik’s familiar positive stride and a more dragging gait. Farad’n turned, stared at the approaching dream interpreter. The Ixian mask was a black, gauzy affair which concealed the face from the forehead to below the chin. There were no eye Slits in the mask. If one were to believe the Ixian boasts, the entire mask was a single eye.\nTyekanik stopped two paces from Farad’n, but the masked old man approached to less than a pace.\n“The interpreter of dreams,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n nodded.\nThe masked old man coughed in a remote grunting fashion, as though trying to bring something up from his stomach.\nFarad’n was acutely conscious of a sour spice smell from the old man. It emanated from the long grey robe which covered his body.\n“Is that mask truly a part of your flesh?” Farad’n asked, realizing he was trying to delay the subject of dreams.\n“While | wear it,” the old man said, and his voice carried a bitter twang and just a suggestion of Fremen accent. “Your\ndream,” he said. “Tell me.”\nFarad’n shrugged. Why not? That was why Tyek had brought the old man. Or was it? Doubts gripped Farad’n and he asked: “Are you truly a practitioner of oneiromancy?”\n“I have come to interpret your dream, Puissant Lord.”\nAgain Farad’n shrugged. This masked figure made him nervous and he glanced at Tyekanik, who remained where he had stopped, arms folded, staring at the fountain.\n“Your dream, then,” the old man pressed.\nFarad’n inhaled deeply, began to relate the dream. It became easier to talk as he got fully into it. He told about the water flowing upward in the well, about the worlds which were atoms dancing in his head, about the snake which transformed itself into a sandworm and exploded in a cloud of dust. Telling about the snake, he was surprised to discover, required more effort. A terrible reluctance inhibited him and this made him angry as he spoke.\nThe old man remained impassive as Farad’n at last fell silent. The black gauze mask moved slightly to his breathing. Farad’n waited. The silence continued.\nPresently Farad’n asked: “Aren’t you going to interpret my dream?”\n“I have interpreted it,” he said, his voice seeming to come from a long distance.\n“Well?” Farad’n heard his own voice squeaking, telling him the tension his dream had produced.\nStill the old man remained impassively silent.\n“Tell me, then!” The anger was obvious in his tone.\n“I said I'd interpret,” the old man said. “I did not agree to tell you my interpretation.”\nEven Tyekanik was moved by this, dropping his arms into balled fists at his sides. “What?” he grated.\n“| did not say I’d reveal my interpretation,” the old man said.\n“You wish more pay?” Farad’n asked.\n“I did not ask pay when | was brought here.” A certain cold pride in the response softened Farad’n’s anger. This was a brave old man, at any rate. He must know death could follow disobedience.\n“Allow me, My Prince,” Tyekanik said as Farad’n started to speak. Then: “Will you tell us why you won’t reveal your interpretation?”\n“Yes, My Lords. The dream tells me there would be no purpose in explaining these things.”\nFarad’n could not contain himself. “Are you saying | already know the meaning of my dream?”\n“Perhaps you do, My Lord, but that is not my gist.”\nTyekanik moved up to stand beside Farad’n. Both glared at the old man. “Explain yourself,” Tyekanik said.\n“Indeed,” Farad’n said.\n“If | were to speak of this dream, to explore these matters of water and dust, snakes and worms, to analyze the atoms which dance in your head as they do in mine—ahh, Puissant Lord, my words would only confuse you and you would insist upon misunderstanding.”\n“Do you fear that your words might anger me?” Farad’n demanded.\n“My Lord! You're already angry.”\n“Is it that you don’t trust us?” Tyekanik asked.\n“That is very close to the mark, My Lord. | do not trust either of you and for the simple reason that you do not trust yourselves.”\n“You walk dangerously close to the edge,” Tyekanik said. “Men have been killed for behavior less abusive than yours.”\nFarad’n nodded, said: “Don’t tempt us to anger.”\n“The fatal consequences of Corrino anger are well known, My Lord of Salusa Secundus,” the old man said.\nTyekanik put a restraining hand on Farad’n’s arm, asked: “Are you trying to goad us into killing you?”\nFarad’n had not thought of that, felt a chill now as he considered what such behavior might mean. Was this old man who called himself Preacher... was he more than he appeared? What might be the consequences of his death? Martyrs could be dangerous creations.\n“| doubt that you'll kill me no matter what I say,” The Preacher said. “I think you know my value, Bashar, and your Prince now suspects it.”\n“You absolutely refuse to interpret his dream?” Tyekanik asked.\n“| have interpreted it.”\n“And you will not reveal what you see in it?”\n“Do you blame me, My Lord?”\n“How can you be valuable to me?” Farad’n asked.\nThe Preacher held out his right hand. “If | but beckon with this hand, Duncan Idaho will come to me and he will obey me.”\n“What idle boast is this?” Farad’n asked.\nBut Tyekanik shook his head, recalling his argument with Wensicia. He said: “My Prince, it could be true. This Preacher has many followers on Dune.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me he was from that place?” Farad’n asked.\nBefore Tyekanik could answer, The Preacher addressed Farad’n: “My Lord, you must not feel guilty about Arrakis. You are but a product of your times. This is a special pleading which any man may make when his guilts assail him.”\n“Guilts!” Farad’n was outraged.\nThe Preacher only shrugged.\nOddly, this shifted Farad’n from outrage to amusement. He laughed, throwing his head back, drawing a startled glance from Tyekanik. Then: “I like you, Preacher.”\n“This gratifies me, Prince,” the old man said.\nSuppressing a chuckle, Farad’n said: “We'll find you an apartment here in the palace. You will be my official\ninterpreter of dreams—even though you never give me a word of interpretation. And you can advise me about Dune. | have a great curiosity about that place.”\n“This | cannot do, Prince.”\nAn edge of his anger returned. Farad’n glared at the black mask. “And why not, pray tell?”\n“My Prince,” Tyekanik said, again touching Farad’n’s arm.\n“What is it, Tyvek?”\n“We brought him here under bonded agreement with the Guild. He is to be returned to Dune.”\n“lam summoned back to Arrakis,” The Preacher said.\n“Who summons you?” Farad’n demanded.\n“A power greater than thine, Prince.”\nFarad’n shot a questioning glance at Tyekanik. “Is he an Atreides spy?”\n“Not likely, My Prince. Alia has put a price on his head.”\n“If it’s not the Atreides, then who summons you?” Farad’n asked, returning his attention to The Preacher.\n“A power greater than the Atreides.”\nA chuckle escaped Farad’n. This was only mystic nonsense. How could Tyek be fooled by such stuff? This Preacher had been summoned—most likely by a dream. Of what importance were dreams?\n“This has been a waste of time, Tyek,” Farad’n said. “Why did you subject me to this . . . this farce?”\n“There is a double price here, My Prince,” Tyekanik said. “This interpreter of dreams promised me to deliver Duncan Idaho as an agent of House Corrino. All he asked was to meet you and interpret your dream.” And Tyekanik added to himself: Or so he told Wensicia! New doubts assailed the Bashar.\n“Why is my dream so important to you, old man?” Farad’n asked.\n“Your dream tells me that great events move toward a logical conclusion,” The Preacher said. “I must hasten my return.”\nMocking, Farad’n said: “And you will remain ins\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FARAD’N<|>PERSON<|>Farad’n is a prince of House Corrino, engaging with religious and political matters, and is curious about dreams and their interpretations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYEKANIK<|>PERSON<|>Tyekanik is a loyal servant to Farad’n, involved in bringing The Preacher to interpret dreams and discuss religious matters.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>PERSON<|>The Preacher is a blind interpreter of dreams wearing an Ixian mask, with a Fremen accent, and claims to have influence over Duncan Idaho.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Corrino is a noble family with political and religious influence, represented by Farad’n in this context.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune, also known as Arrakis, is a desert planet central to political and religious conflicts, and home to The Preacher.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>GEO<|>Salusa Secundus is a planet associated with House Corrino and Farad’n.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IX<|>GEO<|>Ix is a planet known for its advanced technology, including the mask worn by The Preacher.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a significant figure whom The Preacher claims to influence.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a ruler of Dune who has placed a bounty on The Preacher.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WENSICIA<|>PERSON<|>Wensicia is a member of House Corrino involved in political strategies.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>TYEKANIK<|>Farad’n and Tyekanik have a master-servant relationship, with Tyekanik arranging meetings and advising Farad’n.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>THE PREACHER<|>Farad’n interacts with The Preacher to interpret his dreams and discuss religious matters.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYEKANIK<|>THE PREACHER<|>Tyekanik brings The Preacher to Farad’n and negotiates his involvement in interpreting dreams.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>DUNE<|>The Preacher is from Dune and is summoned back there, indicating a strong connection.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>The Preacher claims to have influence over Duncan Idaho.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>Farad’n is a prince of House Corrino, representing its interests.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>ALIA<|>Alia has placed a bounty on The Preacher, indicating a hostile relationship.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYEKANIK<|>WENSICIA<|>Tyekanik and Wensicia collaborate on political strategies involving The Preacher.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>Farad’n is associated with Salusa Secundus, a planet linked to House Corrino.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>IX<|>The Preacher wears an Ixian mask, indicating a connection to Ixian technology.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
