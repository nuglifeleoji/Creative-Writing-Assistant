，荆州捷报使命，络绎而至。不一日，关兴到，具言水淹七军之事。忽又报马到来，报说关公于江边多设墩台，提防甚密，万无一失。因此玄德放心。\n\n    忽一日，玄德自觉浑身肉颤，行坐不安；至夜，不能宁睡，起坐内室，秉烛看书，觉神思昏迷，伏几而卧；就室中起一阵冷风，灯灭复明，抬头见一人立于灯下。玄德问曰：“汝何人，夤度至吾内室？”其人不答。玄德疑怪，自起视之，乃是关公，于灯影下往来躲避。玄德曰：“贤弟别来无恙！夜深至此，必有大故。吾与汝情同骨肉，因何回避？”关公泣告曰：“愿兄起兵，以雪弟恨！”言讫，冷风骤起，关公不见。玄德忽然惊觉，乃是一梦。时正三鼓。玄德大疑，急出前殿，使人请孔明来。孔明入见，玄德细言梦警。孔明曰：“此乃王上心思关公，故有此梦。何必多疑？”玄德再三疑虑，孔明以善言解之。孔明辞出，至中门外，迎见许靖。靖曰：“某才赴军师府下报一机密，听知军师入宫，特来至此。”孔明曰：“有何机密？”靖曰：“某适闻外人传说，东吴吕蒙已袭荆州，关公已遇害！故特来密报军师。”孔明曰：“吾夜观天象，见将星落于荆楚之地，已知云长必然被祸，但恐王上忧虑，故未敢言。”\n\n    二人正说之间，忽然殿内转出一人，扯住孔明衣袖而言曰：“如此凶信，公何瞒我！”孔明视之，乃玄德也。孔明、许靖奏曰：“适来所言，皆传闻之事，未足深信。愿王上宽怀，勿生忧虑。”玄德曰：“孤与云长，誓同生死；彼若有失，孤岂能独生耶！”孔明、许靖正劝解之间，忽近侍奏曰：“马良、伊籍至。”玄德急召入问之。二人具说荆州已失，关公兵败求救，呈上表章。未及拆观，侍臣又奏荆州廖化至。玄德急召入。化哭拜于地，细奏刘封、孟达不发救兵之事。玄德大惊曰：“若如此，吾弟休矣！”孔明曰：“刘封、孟达如此无礼，罪不容诛！王上宽心，亮亲提一旅之师，去救荆襄之急。”玄德泣曰：“云长有失，孤断不独生！孤来日自提一军去救云长！”遂一面差人赴阆中报知翼德，一面差人会集人马。\n\n    未及天明，一连数次，报说关公夜走临沮，为吴将所获，义不屈节，父子归神。玄德听罢，大叫一声，昏绝于地。正是：为念当年同誓死，忍教今日独捐生！未知玄德性命如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第七\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
