His unwavering dedication to Paul was demonstrated in his ultimate sacrifice, where he gave his life to ensure Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, could escape from the Sardaukar forces. The descriptions confirm that Duncan's heroic act was pivotal in securing Paul's survival, though they vary slightly in phrasingâ€”one emphasizes his role in protecting both Paul and Jessica, while another focuses solely on Paul's escape. Regardless, the core narrative remains consistent: Duncan Idaho died defending Paul Atreides, cementing his legacy as a devoted and selfless ally.
