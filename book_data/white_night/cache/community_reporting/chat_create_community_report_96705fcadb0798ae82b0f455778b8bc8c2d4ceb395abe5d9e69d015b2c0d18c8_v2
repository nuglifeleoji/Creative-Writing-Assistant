During practice sessions, 蓝银草 is released, showcasing its characteristics and abilities.\n\nDespite its importance to 蓝轩宇, 蓝银草 is often regarded as an ordinary martial soul, commonly viewed as a废武魂, which translates to a useless or ineffective martial spirit.

It is characterized by silver and gold colors, which are central to 蓝轩宇's training and development. Notably, 蓝银草 has the innate ability of满魂力, indicating that it has a full soul power from the outset.

The martial soul is visually distinctive, marked by silver patterns that enhance its identity as 蓝轩宇's 武魂.\n\nIn summary, 蓝银草 is a martial spirit that embodies both pride and challenge for 蓝轩宇.
