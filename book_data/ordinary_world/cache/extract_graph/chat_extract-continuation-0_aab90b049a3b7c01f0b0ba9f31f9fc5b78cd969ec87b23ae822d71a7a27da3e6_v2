那年，他和润叶已经在村里的小学上到了四年级。有一次，同学们在校院里玩“找朋友”的游戏。他不敢到人圈里去，因为他屁股后面的补钉又绽开了，肉都露在了外面。他看别人玩，自己脊背紧贴着教室墙，连动也不就动。有一个男孩子大概早发现他裤子破了，这时就串通几个人一扑上来，把他拉在了人圈里。所有的男娃娃都指着他的屁股蛋“噢”一声喊叫起来，并且起哄唱起了那首农村的儿歌：烂裤裤，没媳妇，尻子里吊个水鸪鸪……女娃娃们都已经到了懂得害羞的年龄，红着脸四散跑了。 \n　　他又难受又委屈。下午放学后，也没回家去。他一个人转到金家祖坟后面的一个土圪崂里，睡在地上哭了一鼻子。土圪崂上面就是高高的神仙山。他想起了老人们常说的那个下凡的仙女；也想起了那个痛哭而死的男人——那男人的眼泪就流成了脚下的哭咽河。哭咽河，哭咽河，男人的眼泪流成的河…… \n　　他突然听见润叶轻轻地喊他。他慌忙坐起来，臊得满脸通红。润叶站在他旁边，说：“我回家里拿了针线，让我给你把补钉缝一缝……” \n　　“你不会做针钱！”他不愿让润叶缝那块补钉——因为那是个丢人地方。 \n　　“我学会做针线了，让我试一下！”润叶说着便蹲在他身边，硬掀转他的身子，便笨拙地给他缝起来了。那时润叶才十岁，说不上会做针线，只是胡串了几针，让原来的补钉能遮住羞丑。她的针不时扎在他的屁股蛋上，疼得他直叫唤。她在后面笑个不停。勉强缝完后，她让他站起来走一走。 \n　　他刚站起来走了几步，就听见后面“嘶”的一声——又破了！ \n　　润叶捂住嘴，笑得前伏后仰，说：“没顶事！让我再缝！”他赶忙说：“算了！我回去叫我妈缝……” \n　　小学生活随着童年的逝去而结束了。一九六四年，他和润叶双双考上了石圪节高小。他在全公社的考生中，名列第一。全村人都说他是个念书的好材料。他父亲也很高兴，就让他去了。石圪节离双水村近，可以每天和同村的学生相跟着回家吃饭，花费并不大。那两年，他就象后来的少平和现在的兰香一样，每天下午回家，第二天早上天不明就起身，带一顿干粮，和其他娃娃摸黑赶到石圪节。润叶家里光景好，已经上了学校的大灶，除过星期六，大部分都在学校住宿，不天天受罪跑路了。他们仍然是一个班，还是同桌。他学习好，常给�\n######################\nOutput:",
