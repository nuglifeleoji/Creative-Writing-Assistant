He signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of Paul.\nThe Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers.\n“I think this one’s an officer, m’Lord,” Gurney said.\nPaul nodded, said: “I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that, man?”\nThe Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.\n“Speak up,” Paul said, “or your Emperor may die.”\nThe man blinked, swallowed.\n“Who am I?” Paul demanded.\n“You are the Duke Paul Atreides,” the man husked.\nHe seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been prepared for such happenings as this day. They’d never known anything but victory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness\nin itself. He put that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program.\n“I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor,” Paul said. And he couched his words in the ancient formula: “I, a Duke of a Great House, an Imperial Kinsman, give my word of bond under the Convention. If the Emperor and his people lay down their arms and come to me here | will guard their lives with my own.” Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the Sardaukar to see. “I Swear it by this.”\nThe man wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Gurney.\n“Yes,” Paul said. “Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of Gurney Halleck.”\n“I will carry the message,” the Sardaukar said.\n“Take him to our forward command post and send him in,” Paul said.\n“Yes, m’Lord.” Gurney motioned for the guard to obey, led them out.\nPaul turned back to Stilgar.\n“Chani and your mother have arrived,” Stilgar said. “Chani has asked time to be alone with her grief. The Reverend Mother sought a moment in the weirding room; | Know not why.”\n“My mother’s sick with longing for a planet she may never see,” Paul said. “Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you cannot walk between them.”\n“Water from the sky,” Stilgar whispered.\nIn that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen naib to a creature of\nthe Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it.\n| have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.\nIn a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room, noting how proper and on-review his guards had become in his presence. He sensed the subtle, prideful competition among them—each hoping for notice from Muad’Dib.\nMuad’Dib from whom all blessings flow, he thought, and it was the bitterest thought of his life. They sense that | must take the throne, he thought. But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad.\nStilgar cleared his throat, said: “Rabban, too, is dead.”\nPaul nodded.\nGuards to the right suddenly snapped aside, standing at attention to open an aisle for Jessica. She wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding across sand, but Paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what she had once been here—concubine to a ruling duke. Her presence carried some of its old assertiveness.\nJessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his fatigue and how he hid it, but found no compassion for him. It was as though she had been rendered incapable of any emotion for her son.\nJessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to fit itself snugly in to her memories. It remained a foreign room, as though she had never walked here, never walked here with her\nbeloved Leto, never confronted a drunken Duncan Idaho here—never, never, never....\nThere should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding memory, she thought. There should be a word for memories that deny themselves.\n“Where is Alia?” she asked.\n“Out doing what any good Fremen child should be doing in such times,” Paul said. “She’s killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the water- recovery teams.”\n“Paul!”\n“You must understand that she does this out of kindness,” he said. “Isn’t it odd how we misunderstand the hidden unity of kindness and cruelty?”\nJessica glared at her son, shocked by the profound change in him. Was it his child’s death did this? she wondered. And she said: “The men tell strange Stories of you, Paul. They say you've all the powers of the legend—nothing can be hidden from you, that you see where others cannot see.”\n“A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends?” he asked.\n“I’ve had a hand in whatever you are,” she admitted, “but you mustn’t expect me to—”\n“How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives?” Paul asked. “There’s a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those experiences, the wisdom they’d bring. But wisdom tempers love, doesn’t it? And it puts a new shape on hate. How can you tell what’s ruthless unless you’ve plumbed the depths of\nboth cruelty and kindness? You should fear me, Mother. | am the Kwisatz Haderach.”\nJessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said: “Once you denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach.”\nPaul shook his head. “I can deny nothing anymore.” He looked up into her eyes. “The Emperor and his people come now. They will be announced any moment. Stand beside me. | wish a clear view of them. My future bride will be among them.”\n“Paul!” Jessica snapped. “Don’t make the mistake your father made!”\n“She’s a princess,” Paul said. “She’s my key to the throne, and that’s all she’ll ever be. Mistake? You think because I’m what you made me that | cannot feel the need for revenge?”\n“Even on the innocent?” she asked, and she thought: He must not make the mistakes I made.\n“There are no innocent anymore,” Paul said.\n“Tell that to Chani,” Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from the rear of the Residency.\nChani entered the Great Hall there, walking between the Fremen guards as though unaware of them. Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back, face mask fastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to stand beside Jessica.\nPaul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks— She gives water to the dead. He felt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he could only feel this thing through Chani’s presence.\n“He is dead, beloved,” Chani said. “Our son is dead.”\nHolding himself under stiff control, Paul got to his feet. He reached out, touched Chani’s cheek, feeling the dampness of her tears. “He cannot be replaced,” Paul said, “but there will be other sons. It is Usul who promises this.” Gently, he moved her aside, gestured to Stilgar.\n“Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.\n“They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people,” Paul said. “I will stand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in the center of the room. They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless | command otherwise.”\n“AS you command, Muad’Dib.”\nAs Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen guards: “You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!”\nThe Emperor’s entourage could be heard approaching now, his Sardaukar humming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits. There came a murmur of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the guard, crossed to confer with Stilgar, then moved to Paul’s side, a strange look in his eyes.\nWill | lose Gurney, too? Paul wondered. The way I lost Stilgar—losing a friend to gain a creature?\n“They have no throwing weapons,” Gurney said. “I’ve made sure of that myself.” He glanced around the room, seeing Paul’s preparations. “Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is with them. Shall | cut him out?”\n“Leave him.”\n“There’re some Guild people, too, demanding special privileges, threatening an embargo against Arrakis. | told them I’d give you their message.”\n“Let them threaten.”\n“Paul!” Jessica hissed behind him. “He’s talking about the Guild!”\n“I'll pull their fangs presently,” Paul said.\nAnd he thought then about the Guild—the force that had specialized for so long that it had become a parasite, unable to exist independently of the life upon which it fed. They had never dared grasp the sword...and now they could not grasp it. They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of specializing on the melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators. They could have done this, lived their glorious day and died. Instead, they’d existed from moment to moment, hoping the seas in which they swam might produce a new host when the old one died.\nThe Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal decision: they’d chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward into stagnation.\nLet them look closely at their new host, Paul thought.\n“There’s also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she’s a friend of your mother,” Gurney said.\n“My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends.”\nAgain, Gurney glanced around the Great Hall, then bent close to Paul’s ear. “Thufir Hawat’s with ’em, m’Lord. | had no chance to see him alone, but he used our old hand signs to say he’s been working\nwith the Harkonnens, thought you were dead. Says he’s to be left among ’em.”\n“You left Thufir among those—”\n“He wanted it...and | thought it best. If...there’s something wrong, he’s where we can control him. If not—we’ve an ear on the other side.”\nPaul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this moment—and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the Emperor commanded he use against “this upstart Duke.”\nThe entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short corridor of lances. There came a murmurous swish of garments, feet rasping the sand that had drifted into the Residency.\nThe Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His Burseg helmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His uniform’s left sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without weapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that kept his immediate area open.\nA Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had ordered. The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and of staring faces.\nPaul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of weeping,\n######################\nOutput:",
