On one hand, they are grappling with significant challenges due to drought conditions that have adversely affected their crops and livelihoods. This struggle highlights the difficulties faced by these farmers as they work to sustain their families and maintain their agricultural practices in the face of environmental adversity.\n\nOn the other hand, \"庄稼人\" also describes the same group of farmers who are present at a gathering, where they are partaking in festivities and enjoying moments of camaraderie and celebration. During this event, they engage in social activities, including drinking and reveling in the company of their fellow villagers.
