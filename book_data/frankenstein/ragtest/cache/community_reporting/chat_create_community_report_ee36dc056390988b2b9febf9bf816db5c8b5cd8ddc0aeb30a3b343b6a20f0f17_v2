It is known for its bustling business districts, including the **Semba** area, and is a hub for both personal and professional activities of several key characters.  \n\n大阪 is the hometown of **唐泽雪穗 (Karazawa Yukiho)**, where she spent her childhood in a financially constrained environment that prevented her from attending private school. Though it was once her home, she no longer has family ties there. The city holds significant personal history for her: her biological mother lived and was hospitalized there, and it is also where her mother passed away. Additionally, her adoptive mother, **唐泽礼子 (Karazawa Reiko)**, had her funeral held in 大阪.  \n\nThe city is a focal point for investigations, as it is where **笹垣 (Sasagaki)**, a detective, works and where the murder case he investigates takes place. **今枝 (Imashi)** also conducts inquiries here, and it is the current residence of **手冢江利子 (Tetsuka Eriko)**.  \n\n大阪 is significant to other characters as well. **秋吉雄一 (Akiyoshi Yuichi)** grew up there and later returns with **栗原典子 (Kurihara Noriko)** to visit landmarks like **心斋桥 (Shinsaibashi)** and **道顿堀 (Dotonbori)**. 典子 stays in a hotel in the city and takes photographs during her visit. Meanwhile, **雪穗** is set to open a new branch of her boutique, **\"\"R&Y\"\"**, in 心斋桥.  \n\nThe city also connects to the past through subtle details—some plants in a victim’s garden were brought from 大阪, hinting at familial or historical links. Additionally, **永明大学 (Eimei University)**, where **诚 (Makoto)** spent four years, is located here.  \n\nIn summary, 大阪 is a dynamic urban center intertwined with the lives of multiple characters—serving as a hometown, a site of tragedy, a place of business, and a key location for investigations. It bridges personal histories, criminal events, and future ambitions, making it an essential backdrop for the narrative.\",13\n623,DESIGNMAKE,\"**DESIGNMAKE** is a company based in Osaka, Japan, specializing in interior design and related services.
