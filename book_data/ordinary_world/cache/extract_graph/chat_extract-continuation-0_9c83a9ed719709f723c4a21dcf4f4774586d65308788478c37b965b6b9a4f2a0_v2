�颗欢蹦乱跳的心稍许平静一些。前面不远处就是大街，那里人声沸腾一片纷扰。人们！你们知道吗？知道这城市有个揽工汉和地委书记的女儿恋爱吗？你们也许没人会相信有这样的事；这样的事只能出现在童话里。可这是真的！ \n　　此刻，我为什么要去找金波？是要告诉他这件事？是啊，多么想给朋友说一说，好让他来分享我的幸福！分享，这个字眼用得不恰当……扯到哪儿去啦！ \n　　是的，我当然会把这事告诉金波的，但不应该是现在。正如他和那位藏族姑娘恋爱一样，秘密最好过一段时间再给朋友倾吐。爱情啊，无论是橄榄还是黄莲，得先自己一个人嚼一嚼！ \n　　既然不是去给金波说这事，现在就不应该去他那里——此刻最好一个人慢慢地回味刚刚发生过的那一切……现在，孙少平发现他已经走到东关大桥的人群里了。 \n　　他猛地停住脚步，不由向人行道旁边那个低矮的砖墙瞥了一眼。 \n　　一股冰凉从后脑勺沿着脊背传遍了全身。他顿时象重感冒退过烧似的清醒而软弱无力。刚刚发生的事一下子就似乎遥远了，而现实却又这么近地出现在眼前！ \n　　他的两条腿自动走到那个砖墙下。他初来黄原之时，就是在这地方落下脚，开始等待包工头来买他的力气。以后他又不止一次来到这地方。 \n　　他弯下腰，不由用粗糙得象石板一样的手掌，在那砖墙上面摸了摸——这是他经常搁那卷破行李的地方……一种无限忧伤的情绪即刻便涌上孙少平的心间。 \n　　你有什么可高兴的？你难道现在就比以前好些了吗？你只不过和地委书记的女儿亲热了片刻，有什么可以忘乎所以地乐个没完？瞧，你在实际生活中的一切都没有丝毫的改变。你仍然象一丛飘蓬流落在人间，到处奔波着出卖自己的体力，用无尽的汗水赚几个钱来养家糊口。你未来的一切都没有着落——可岁月却日复一日地流逝了……孙少平立在砖墙边，眼里旋转着两团泪水，街道上的人群和灯火都已经模糊不清。 \n　　爱情的温柔使少平感到自己变得脆弱起来。他现在痛心地认识到，就是他和她已经到了这一步，但他们仍然还在两个世界里！而且随着晓霞的远走高飞，这两个世界只能是越来越远！ \n　　孙少平强迫自己立刻回到现实中来。他，农民孙玉厚的儿子，一个漂泊的揽工汉，岂敢一味地沉醉在一种罗曼谛克的情调中？是的，他和地委书记的女儿拥抱了，亲吻了，但这是否意味着他就能和她\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
