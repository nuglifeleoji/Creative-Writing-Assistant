Pau/ must be cautioned about their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine, yes, but not as wife.\nThen she wondered at herself, thinking: Have / been infected with his schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. / can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet...| was more than concubine.\n“Mother.”\nPaul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.\n“Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?”\nJessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. “I think so.”\n“Chani showed me...because I’m Supposed to see it and give my...permission for the weighing of the water.”\nJessica looked at Chani.\n“They’re recovering Jamis’ water,” Chani said, and her thin voice came out nasal past the nose plugs. “It’s the rule. The flesh belongs to the person, but his water belongs to the tribe...except in the combat.”\n“They say the water’s mine,” Paul said.\nJessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.\n“Combat water belongs to the winner,” Chani said. “It’s because you have to fight in the open without stillsuits. The winner has to get his water back that he loses while fighting.”\n“| don’t want his water,” Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the inner eye. He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was\npositive: he did not want the water distilled out of Jamis’ flesh.\n“It’s...water,” Chani said.\nJessica marveled at the way she said it. “Water.” So much meaning in a simple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica’s mind: “Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.” And Jessica thought: Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters...if we’re to survive.\n“You will accept the water,” Jessica said.\nShe recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once with Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his Support in a questionable venture—because money maintained power for the Atreides.\nOn Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.\nPaul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered—not because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice had forced him to reevaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.\nPresently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh’s O.C. Bible. He said: “From water does all life begin.”\nJessica stared at him. Where did he learn that quotation? she asked herself. He hasn’t studied the mysteries.\n“Thus it is sooken,” Chani said. “Giudichar mantene: It is written in the Shah-Nama that water was the first of all things created.”\nFor no reason she could explain (and this bothered her more than the sensation), Jessica suddenly\nshuddered. She turned away to hide her confusion and was just in time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.\n“It is time!”\nThe voice was Stilgar’s ringing in the cavern. “Jamis’ weapon has been killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained the phases for the moons that daily wane and—in the end— appear as bent and withered twigs.” Stilgar’s voice lowered. “Thus it is with Jamis.”\nSilence fell like a blanket on the cavern.\nJessica saw the gray-shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within the dark inner reaches. She glanced back at the basin, sensing the coolness.\n“The friends of Jamis will approach,” Stilgar said.\nMen moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave. Its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.\nChani took a step away as though pulled by the light.\nJessica bent close to Paul’s ear, speaking in the family code: “Follow their lead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of Jamis.”\nIt will be more than that, Paul thought. And he felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and render it motionless.\nChani glided back to Jessica’s side, took her hand. “Come, Sayyadina. We must sit apart.”\nPaul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt abandoned.\nThe men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.\n“Come, Usul.”\nHe allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.\nThe troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with the movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at his neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar’s feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric.\n“The spirit leaves the body’s water when the first moon rises,” Stilgar intoned. “Thus it is sooken. When we see the first moon rise this night, whom will it summon?”\n“Jamis,” the troop responded.\nStilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of faces. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the hawk plane stooped upon us at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety.”\nHe bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. “I take this robe as a friend of Jamis—leader’s right.” He draped the robe over a shoulder, straightening.\nNow, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center, the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty Sheath, a folded pack, a paracompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of bundled feathers...and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.\nSo Jamis played the baliset, Paul thought. The Instrument reminded him of Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory of the future in the past that some chance-lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the reunions were few and shadowed. They puzzled him. The uncertainty factor touched him with wonder. Does it mean that something I will do...that | may do, could destroy Gurney...or bring him back to life...or....\nPaul swallowed, shook his head.\nAgain, Stilgar bent over the mound.\n“For Jamis’ woman and for the guards,” he said. The small rocks and the book were taken into the folds of his robe.\n“Leader's right,” the troop intoned.\n“The marker for Jamis’ coffee service,” Stilgar said, and he lifted a flat disc of green metal. “That it Shall be given to Usul in suitable ceremony when we return to the sietch.”\n“Leader's right,” the troop intoned.\nLastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it. “For the funeral plain,” he said.\n“For the funeral plain,” the troop responded.\nAt her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the ancient source of the rite, and she thought: The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture—it begins in the dignity with which we treat our dead. She looked across at Paul, wondering: Will he see it? Will he know what to do?\n“We are friends of Jamis,” Stilgar said. “We are not wailing for our dead like a pack of garvarg.”\nA gray-bearded man to Paul’s left stood up. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans. “When our water went below minim at the siege at Two Brids, Jamis shared.” The man returned to his place in the circle.\nAm I supposed to say | was a friend of Jamis? Paul wondered. Do they expect me to take something from that pile? He saw faces turn toward him, turn away. They do expect it!\nAnother man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the paracompass. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the patrol caught us at Bight-of-the-Cliff and | was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved.” He returned to his place in the circle.\nAgain, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them, lowered his eyes. An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: “Would you bring the destruction on us?”\nHow can I say I was his friend? Paul wondered.\nAnother figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded face came into the light, he recognized his mother. She removed a kerchief from\nthe mount. “I was a friend of Jamis,” she said. “When the spirit of spirits within him saw the needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son.” She returned to her place.\nAnd Paul recalled the scorn in his mother’s voice as she had confronted him after the fight. “How does it feel to be a killer?”\nAgain, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in the troop. A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on “The Cult of the Dead” flickered through Paul’s mind. He knew what he had to do.\nSlowly, Paul got to his feet.\nA sigh passed around the circle.\nPaul felt the diminishment of his se/fas he advanced into the center of the circle. It was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here. He bent over the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged softly as it struck against something in the pile.\n“I was a friend of Jamis,” Paul whispered.\nHe felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice. “Jamis taught me...that...when you kill...you pay for it. | wish I’d known Jamis better.”\nBlindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock floor.\nA voice hissed: “He sheds tears!”\nIt was taken up around the ring: “Usul gives moisture to the dead!”\nHe felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.\nJessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears. She focused on the words: “He gives moisture to the dead.” It was a gift to the shadow world—tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.\nNothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate value of water. Not the water- sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a Substance more precious than all others—it was life itself and entwined\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fd9106439ff4d036f104c22d015eaa93b618bea530960601a7bb4a6d1e3c6477_v2"}
