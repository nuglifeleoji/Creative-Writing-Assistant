\n　　大家在人行道上围住省委书记，纷纷问他身体受伤没有？乔伯年笑着说：“没受伤，只受了点气。”他问大家：“现在咱们到什么地方了？” \n　　“快到八路口了！”市交通局长说。 \n　　“那咱们还得走回去两站，才能倒坐电车？” \n　　秦富功满脸愧色，赶忙说：“乔书记！我要为你的安全负责，今天无论如何再不要去挤电车了。我们市上的几个同志心里都很沉重。今天对我们的教育太深刻了！你尽管还没批评我们一句，但实际情况对我们的工作提出了无情的批评。请相信我们一定会尽快改变市内交通状况的……”这时候，一溜小轿车悄无声息地停在了人行道旁。遵照张生民的指示，省市领导的小车一直不远不近地跟着刚才那辆四路公共汽车。现在，生民已经让保卫人员用步话机把车调过来了。 \n　　乔伯年只好说：“那好吧……这算是一次现场办公会。同志们，还要说什么吗？事实已经全说明了！我希望这个问题能得到尽快解决！但不要头疼医头，脚疼医脚，而应该通过交通入手，全面改变市内各种公共服务事业的落后面貌……” \n　　乔伯年做了简短的指示以后，领导们就分别坐车回了省市机关。 \n　　当天晚上，乔伯年参加完省上的一个工业会议，回到家吃了几片药，正准备上二楼去休息，客厅旁的电话间响起了急促的铃声。 \n　　他拿起电话，原来是市委书记秦富功。 \n　　秦书记在电话上告诉他，他已经严肃地处理了今天那几辆捣蛋公共汽车的有关人员，而且开除了他们坐的那辆车上的售票员。为了杀一儆百，他准备将这件事在晚报上公开报道…… \n　　乔伯年握着话筒半天说不出话来了。 \n　　他长叹了一口气，问秦富功：“这就是你们解决问题的办法？请你立即撤销对那些人的处分！也不准见报！”他放下话筒，两只手撑在桌子上，望着窗外满天星斗，陷入到了焦灼的思虑之中…… \n                  第3章\n　　一九七九年，农历有个闰六月。 \n　　阳历六月上旬，也就是农历五月芒种前后，田福军从省城返回黄原。出任了地区行政公署专员。 \n　　这件事立刻在整个黄原地区引起了各方面的强烈反响。半月前，当原任专员调到省第二轻工业局任局长之后，地区各部门和各机关的干部就开始纷纷猜测谁将是专员的继任者。对地区部门的许多干部来说，这样重大的人事问题不关心是不可能的，不议论是不由人的。 \n　　从省里的各种渠道马上传回来了各种小道消息。从这些消息看来，地区除苗凯以外几乎所有的副职，都有担任专员的可能性。也有几个地区部门的领导人和一两位名声突出的县委书记，列入了这个专员继任\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
