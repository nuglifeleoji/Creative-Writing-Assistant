Much depends on what people dream in the secrecy of their hearts. | have always been as concerned with the shaping of dreams as with the shaping of actions. Between the lines of my journals is the struggle with humankind’s view of itself—a sweaty contest on a field where motives from our darkest past can well up out of an unconscious reservoir and become events with which we not only must live but contend. It is the hydra-headed monster which always attacks from your blind side. | pray, therefore, that when you have traversed my portion of the Golden Path you no longer will be innocent children dancing to music you cannot hear.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nN ayla moved in a steady, plodding pace as she climbed the circular stairs to the God Emperor’s audience chamber atop the Citadel’s south tower. Each time she traversed the southwest arc of the tower, the narrow slitted windows drew dust-defined golden lines across her path. She knew that the central wall beside her confined a lift of Ixian make large enough to carry her Lord’s bulk to the upper chamber, certainly large enough to hold her relatively smaller body, but she did not resent the fact that she was required to use the stairs.\nThe breeze through the open slits brought her the burnt- flint smell of blown sand. The low-lying sun ignited the light of red mineral flakes in the inner wall, ruby matches glowing there. Now and then she cast a glance through a slitted window at the dunes. Never once did she pause to admire the things to be seen around her.\n“You have heroic patience, Nayla,” the Lord had once told her.\nRemembrance of those words warmed Nayla now.\nWithin the tower, Leto followed Nayla’s progress up the long circular stairs that spiraled around the Ixian tube. Her progress was transmitted to him by an Ixian device which projected her approaching image quarter-size onto a region of three-dimensional focus directly in front of his eyes.\nHow precisely she moves, he thought.\nThe precision, he knew, came from a passionate Simplicity.\nShe wore her Fish Speaker blues and a cape-robe without the hawk at the breast. Once past the guard station at the foot of the tower, she had thrown back the cibus mask he required her to wear on these personal visits. Her blocky, muscular body was like that of many others among his guardians, but her face was like no other in all of his memory—almost square with a mouth so wide it seemed to extend around the cheeks, an illusion caused by deep creases at the corners. Her eyes were pale green, the closely cropped hair like old ivory. Her forehead added to the square effect, almost flat with pale eyebrows which often went unnoticed because of the compelling eyes. The nose was a Straight, shallow line which terminated close to the thin-lipped mouth.\nWhen Nayla spoke, her great jaws opened and closed like those of some primordial animal. Her strength, known to few outside the corps of Fish Speakers, was legendary there. Leto had seen her lift a one-hundred-kilo man with one hand. Her presence on Arrakis had been arranged originally without Moneo’s intervention, although the majordomo knew Leto employed his Fish Speakers as secret agents.\nLeto turned his head away from the plodding image and looked out the wide opening beside him at the desert to the south. The colors of the distant rocks danced in his awareness—brown, gold, a deep amber. There was a line of pink on a faraway cliff the exact hue of an egret’s feathers. Egrets did not exist anymore except in Leto’s memory, but he could place that pale pastel ribbon of stone against an\ninner eye and it was as though the extinct bird flew past him.\nThe climb, he knew, should be starting to tire even Nayla. She paused at last to rest, stopping at a point two steps past the three-quarter mark, precisely the place where she rested every time. It was part of her precision, one of the reasons he had brought her back from the distant garrison on Seprek.\nA Dune hawk floated past the opening beside Leto only a few wing lengths from the tower wall. Its attention was held on the shadows at the base of the Citadel. Small animals sometimes emerged there, Leto knew. Dimly on the horizon beyond the hawk’s path he could see a line of clouds.\nWhat a strange thing those were to the Old Fremen in him: clouds on Arrakis and rain and open water.\nLeto reminded the inner voices: Except for this last desert, my Sareer, the remodeling of Dune into verdant Arrakis has gone on remorselessly since the first days of my rule.\nThe influence of geography on history went mostly unrecognized, Leto thought. Humans tended to look more at the influence of history on geography.\nWho owns this river passage? This verdant valley? This peninsula? This planet?\nNone of us.\nNayla was climbing once more, her gaze fixed upward on the stairs she must traverse. Leto’s thoughts locked on her.\nIn many ways, she is the most useful assistant I have ever had. I am her God. She worships me quite unquestioningly. Even when I playfully attack her faith, she takes this merely as testing. She knows herself superior to any test.\nWhen he had sent her to the rebellion and had told her to obey Siona in all things, she did not question. When Nayla doubted, even when she framed her doubts in words, her own thoughts were enough to restore faith ... or had been\nenough. Recent messages, however, made it clear that Nayla required the Holy Presence to rebuild her inner strength.\nLeto recalled the first conversation with Nayla, the woman trembling in her eagerness to please.\n“Even if Siona sends you to kill me, you must obey. She must never learn that you serve me.”\n“No one can kill you, Lord.”\n“But you must obey Siona.”\n“Of course, Lord. That is your command.”\n“You must obey her in all things.”\n“I will do it, Lord.”\nAnother test. Nayla does not question my tests. She treats them as flea bites. Her Lord commands? Nayla obeys. I must not let anything change that relationship.\nShe would have made a superb Shadout in the old days, Leto thought. It was one of the reasons he had given Nayla a crysknife, a real one preserved from Sietch Tabr. It had belonged to one of Stilgar’s wives. Nayla wore it ina concealed sheath beneath her robes, more a talisman than a weapon. He had given it to her in the original ritual, a ceremony which had surprised him by evoking emotions he had thought forever buried.\n“This is the tooth of Shai-Hulud.”\nHe had extended the blade to her on his silvery-skinned hands.\n“Take it and you become part of both past and future. Soil it and the past will give you no future.”\nNayla had accepted the blade, then the sheath.\n“Draw the blood of a finger,” Leto had commanded.\nNayla had obeyed.\n“Sheath the blade. Never remove it without drawing blood.”\nAgain, Nayla had obeyed.\nAs Leto watched the three-dimensional image of Nayla’s approach, his reflections on that old ceremony were touched\nby sadness. Unless fixed in the Old Fremen way, the blade would grow increasingly brittle and useless. It would keep its crysknife shape throughout Nayla’s life, but little longer.\n| have thrown away a bit of the past.\nHow sad it was that the Shadout of old had become today’s Fish Speaker. And a true crysknife had been used to bind a servant more strongly to her master. He knew that some thought his Fish Speakers were really priestesses— Leto’s answer to the Bene Gesserit.\n“He creates another religion,” the Bene Gesserit said.\nNonsense! | have not created a religion. lam the religion!\nNayla entered the tower sanctuary and stood three paces from Leto’s cart, her gaze lowered in proper subservience.\nStill in his memories, Leto said: “Look at me, woman!”\nShe obeyed.\n“I have created a holy obscenity!” he said. “This religion built around my person disgusts me!”\n“Yes, Lord.”\nNayla’s green eyes on the gilded cushions of her cheeks stared out at him without questioning, without comprehension, without the need of either response.\nlf | sent her out to collect the stars, she would go and she would attempt it. She thinks | am testing her again. | do believe she could anger me.\n“This damnable religion should end with me!” Leto shouted. “Why should | want to loose a religion upon my people? Religions wreck from within—Empires and individuals alike! It’s all the same.”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“Religions create radicals and fanatics like you!”\n“Thank You, Lord.”\nThe short-lived pseudo-rage sank back out of sight into the depths of his memories. Nothing dented the hard surface of Nayla’s faith.\n“Topri has reported to me through Moneo,” Leto said. “Tell me about this Topri.”\n“Topri is a worm.”\n“Isn't that what you call me when you’re among the rebels?”\n“I obey my Lord in everything.”\nTouché!\n“Topri is not worth cultivating then?” Leto asked.\n“Siona assessed him correctly. He is clumsy. He says things which others will repeat, thus exposing his hand in the matter. Within seconds after Kobat began to speak, she had confirmation that Topri was a spy.”\nEveryone agrees, even Moneo, Leto thought. Jopri is not a good spy.\nThe agreement amused Leto. The petty machinations muddied water which remained completely transparent to him. The performers, however, still suited his designs.\n“Siona does not suspect you?” Leto asked.\n“Tam not clumsy.”\n“Do you know why | summoned you?”\n“To test my faith.”\nAhhh, Nayla. How little you know of testing.\n“I want your assessment of Siona. | want to see it on your face and see it in your movements and hear it in your voice,” Leto said. “Is she ready?”\n“The Fish Speakers need that one, Lord. Why do You risk losing her?”\n“Forcing the issue is the surest way of losing what | treasure most in her,” Leto said. “She must come to me with all of her strengths intact.”\nNayla lowered her gaze. “As my Lord commands.”\nLeto recognized the response. It was a Nayla reaction to whatever she failed to understand.\n“Will she survive the test, Nayla?”\n“As my Lord describes the test...” Nayla lifted her gaze to Leto’s face, shrugged. “I do not know, Lord. Certainly, she is strong. She was the only one to survive the wolves. But she is ruled by hate.”\n“Quite naturally. Tell me, Nayla, what will she do with the things she stole from me?”\n“Did Topri not inform you about the books which they say contain Your Sacred Words?”\nOdd how she can capitalize words only with her voice, Leto thought. He spoke curtly.\n“Yes, yes. The Ixians have a copy and soon the Guild and Sisterhood as well will be hard at work on them.”\n“What are those books, Lord?”\n“They are my words for my people. | want them to be read. What | want to know is what Siona has said about the Citadel charts she took.”\n“She says there is a great hoard of melange beneath Your Citadel, Lord, and the charts will reveal it.”\n“The charts will not reveal it. Will she tunnel?”\n“She seeks Ix", " do not know, Lord. Certainly, she is strong. She was the only one to survive the wolves. But she is ruled by hate.”\n“Quite naturally. Tell me, Nayla, what will she do with the things she stole from me?”\n“Did Topri not inform you about the books which they say contain Your Sacred Words?”\nOdd how she can capitalize words only with her voice, Leto thought. He spoke curtly.\n“Yes, yes. The Ixians have a copy and soon the Guild and Sisterhood as well will be hard at work on them.”\n“What are those books, Lord?”\n“They are my words for my people. | want them to be read. What | want to know is what Siona has said about the Citadel charts she took.”\n“She says there is a great hoard of melange beneath Your Citadel, Lord, and the charts will reveal it.”\n“The charts will not reveal it. Will she tunnel?”\n“She seeks Ixian tools for that.”\n“Ix will not provide them.”\n“Is there such a hoard of spice, Lord?”\n“Yes.”\n“There is a story about how Your hoard is defended, Lord. That Arrakis itself would be destroyed if anyone tried to steal Your melange. Is it true?”\n“Yes. And that would shatter the Empire. Nothing would survive—not Guild or Sisterhood, not Ix or Tleilaxu, not even the Fish Speakers.”\nShe shuddered, then: “I will not let Siona try to get Your spice.”\n“Nayla! | commanded you to obey Siona in everything. Is this how you serve me?”\n“Lord?” She stood in fear of his anger, closer to a loss of faith than he had ever seen her. It was the crisis he had created, knowing how it must end. Slowly, Nayla relaxed. He could see the shape of her thought as though she had laid it out for him in illuminated words.\nThe ultimate test!\n“You will return to Siona and guard her life with your own,” Leto said. “That is the task | set for you and that you accepted. It is why you were chosen. It is why you carry a blade from Stilgar’s household.”\nHer right hand went to the crysknife concealed beneath her robe.\nHow sure it is, Leto thought, that a weapon can lock a person into a predictable pattern of behavior.\nHe stared with fascination at Nayla’s rigid body. Her eyes were empty of everything except adoration.\nThe ultimate rhetorical despotism... and I despise it!\n“Go then!” he barked.\nNayla turned and fled the Holy Presence.\nIs it worth this? Leto wondered.\nBut Nayla had told him what he needed to know. Nayla had renewed her faith and revealed with accuracy the thing which Leto could not find in Siona’s fading image. Nayla’s instincts were to be trusted.\nSiona has reached that explosive moment which I require.\nThe Duncans always think it odd that | choose women for combat forces, but my Fish Speakers are a temporary army in every sense. While they can be violent and vicious, women are profoundly different from men in their dedication to battle. The cradle of genesis ultimately predisposes them to behavior more protective of life. They have proved to be the best keepers of the Golden Path. | reinforce this in my design for their training. They are set aside for a time from ordinary routines. | give them special sharings which they can look back upon with pleasure for the rest of their lives. They come of age in the company of their sisters in preparation for events more profound. What you share in such companionship always prepares you for greater things. The haze of nostalgia covers their days among their sisters, making those days into something different than they were. That’s the way today changes history. All contemporaries do not inhabit the same time. The past is always changing, but few realize it.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nfter sending word to the Fish Speakers, Leto descended\nto the crypt in the late evening. He had found it best to begin the first interview with a new Duncan Idaho ina darkened room where the ghola could hear Leto describe himself before actually seeing the pre-worm body. There was a Small side room carved in black stone off the central rotunda of the crypt which suited this requirement. The chamber was large enough to accommodate Leto on his cart, but the ceiling was low. Illumination came from hidden glowglobes which he controlled. There was only the one door, but it was in two segments—one swinging wide to admit the Royal Cart, the other a small portal in human dimensions.\nLeto rolled his Royal Cart into the chamber, sealed the\nlarge portal and opened the smaller one. He composed himself then for the ordeal.\nBoredom was an increasing problem. The pattern of the Tleilaxu gholas had become boringly repetitious. Once, Leto had sent word warning the Tleilaxu to send no more Duncans, but they had known they could disobey him in this thing.\nSometimes | think they do it just to keep disobedience alive!\nThe Tleilaxu relied on an important thing which they knew protected them in other matters.\nThe presence of a Duncan pleases the Paul Atreides in me.\nAs Leto had explained it to Moneo in the majordomo’s first days at the Citadel:\n“The Duncans must come to me with much more than Tleilaxu preparation. You must see to it that my houris gentle the Duncans and that the women answer some of his questions.”\n“Which questions may they answer, Lord?”\n“They know.”\nMoneo had, of course, learned all about this procedure over the years.\nLeto heard Moneo’s voice outside the darkened room, then the sound of the Fish Speaker escort and the hesitantly distinctive footsteps of the new ghola.\n“Through that door,” Moneo said. “It will be dark inside and we will close the door behind you. Stop just inside and wait for the Lord Leto to speak.”\n“Why will it be dark?” The Duncan's voice was full of aggressive misgivings.\n“He will explain.”\nIdaho was thrust into the room and the door was sealed behind him.\nLeto knew what the ghola saw—only shadows among Shadows and blackness where not even the source of a voice could be fixed. As usual, Leto brought the Paul Muad’Dib voice into play.\n“It pleases me to see you again, Duncan.”\n“I can’t see you!”\nIdaho was a warrior, and the warrior attacks. This reassured Leto that the ghola was a fully restored original. The morality play by which the Tleilaxu reawakened a ghola’s pre-death memories always left some uncertainties in the gholas’ minds. Some of the Duncans believed they had threatened a real Paul Muad’Dib. This one carried such illusions.\n“I hear Paul’s voice but | can’t see him,” Idaho said. He didn’t try to conceal the frustrations, let them all come out in his voice.\nWhy was an Atreides playing this stupid game? Paul was truly dead in some long-ago and this was Leto, the carrier of Paul’s resurrected memories ... and the memories of many others!—if the Tleilaxu stories were to be believed.\n“You have been told that you are only the latest in a long line of duplicates,” Leto said.\n“I have none of those memories.”\nLeto recognized hysteria in the Duncan, barely covered by the warrior bravado. The cursed Tleilaxu post-tank restoration tactics had produced the usual mental chaos. This Duncan had arrived in a state of near shock, strongly suspecting he was insane. Leto knew that the most subtle powers of reassurance would be required now to soothe the poor fellow. This would be emotionally draining for both of them.\n“There have been many changes, Duncan,” Leto said. “One thing, though, does not change. | am still Atreides.”\n“They said your body is...”\n“Yes, that has changed.”\n“The damned Tleilaxu! They tried to make me kill someone |... well, he looked like you. | suddenly remembered who | was and there was this . . . Could that have been a Muad’Dib ghola?”\n“A Face Dancer mimic, | assure you.”\n“He looked and talked so much like... Are you sure?”\n“An actor, no more. Did he survive?”\n“Of course! That’s how they wakened my memories. They explained the whole damned thing. Is it true?”\n“It’s true, Duncan. | detest it, but | permit it for the pleasure of your company.”\nThe potential victims always survive, Leto thought. At least for the Duncans I see. There have been slips, the fake Paul slain and the Duncans wasted. But there are always more cells carefully preserved from the original.\n“What about your body?” Idaho demanded.\nMuad’Dib could be retired now; Leto resumed his usual voice. “| accepted the sandtrout as my skin. They have been changing me ever since.”\n“Why?”\n“I will explain that in due course.”\n“The Tleilaxu said you look like a sandworm.”\n“What did my Fish Speakers say?”\n“They said you're God. Why do you call them Fish Speakers?”\n“An old conceit. The first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams. They learned valuable things that way.”\n“How do you know?”\n“I am those women ...and everything that came before and after them.”\nLeto heard the dry swallowing in Idaho’s throat, then: “I see why the darkness. You’re giving me time to adjust.”\n“You always were quick, Duncan.”\nExcept when you were slow.\n“How long have you been changing?”\n“More than thirty-five hundred years.”\n“Then what the Tleilaxu told me is true.”\n“They seldom dare to lie anymore.”\n“That’s a long time.”\n“Very long.”\n“The Tleilaxu have ... copied me many times?”\n“Many.”\nIt’s time you asked how many, Duncan.\n“How many of me?”\n“I will let you see the records for yourself.”\nAnd so it starts, Leto thought.\nThis exchange always appeared to satisfy the Duncans, but there was no escaping the nature of the question:\n“How many of me?”\nThe Duncans made no distinctions of the flesh even though no mutual memories passed between gholas of the same stock.\n“I remember my death,” Idaho said. “Harkonnen blades, lots of them trying to get at you and Jessica.”\nLeto restored the Muad’Dib voice for momentary play: “| was there, Duncan.”\n“I’m a replacement, is that right?” Idaho asked.\n“That’s right,” Leto said.\n“How did the other... me...I mean, how did he die?”\n“All flesh wears out, Duncan. It’s in the records.”\nLeto waited patiently, wondering how long it would be until the tamed history failed to satisfy this Duncan.\n“What do you really look like?” Idaho asked. “What’s this sandworm body the Tleilaxu described?”\n“It will make sandworms of sorts someday. It’s already far down the road of metamorphosis.”\n“What do you mean of sorts?”\n“It will have more ganglia. It will be aware.”\n“Can't we have some light? I'd like to see you.”\nLeto commanded the floodlights. Brilliant illumination filled the room. The black walls and the lighting had been arranged to focus the illumination on Leto, every visible detail revealed.\nIdaho swept his gaze along the faceted silvery-gray body, noted the beginnings of a sandworm’s ribbed sections, the sinuous flexings .. . the small protuberances which had once", " how did he die?”\n“All flesh wears out, Duncan. It’s in the records.”\nLeto waited patiently, wondering how long it would be until the tamed history failed to satisfy this Duncan.\n“What do you really look like?” Idaho asked. “What’s this sandworm body the Tleilaxu described?”\n“It will make sandworms of sorts someday.

I'd like to see you.”\nLeto commanded the floodlights. Brilliant illumination filled the room. The black walls and the lighting had been arranged to focus the illumination on Leto, every visible detail revealed.\nIdaho swept his gaze along the faceted silvery-gray body, noted the beginnings of a sandworm’s ribbed sections, the sinuous flexings .. . the small protuberances which had once been feet and legs, one of them somewhat shorter\nthan the other. He brought his attention back to the well- defined arms and hands and finally lifted his attention to the cowled face with its pink skin almost lost in the immensity, a ridiculous extrusion on such a body.\n“Well, Duncan,” Leto said. “You were warned.”\nIdaho gestured mutely toward the pre-worm body.\nLeto asked it for him: “Why?”\nIdaho nodded.\n“I’m still Atreides, Duncan, and | assure you with all the honor of that name, there were compelling reasons.”\n“What could possibly .. .”\n“You will learn in time.”\nIdaho merely shook his head from side to side.\n“It’s not a pleasant revelation,” Leto said. “It requires that you learn other things first. Trust the word of an Atreides.”\nOver the centuries, Leto had found that this invocation of Idaho’s profound loyalties to all things Atreides dampened the immediate wellspring of personal questions. Once more, the formula worked.\n“So I’m to serve the Atreides again,” Idaho said. “That sounds familiar. Is it?”\n“In many ways, old friend.”\n“Old to you, maybe, but not to me. How will | serve?”\n“Didn’t my Fish Speakers tell you?”\n“They said | would command your elite Guard, a force chosen from among them. | don’t understand that. An army of women?”\n“| need a trusted companion who can command my Guard. You object?”\n“Why women?”\n“There are behavioral differences between the sexes which make women extremely valuable in this role.”\n“You're not answering my question.”\n“You think them inadequate?”\n“Some of them looked pretty tough, but...”\n“Others were, ahhh, soft with you?”\nIdaho blushed.\nLeto found this a charming reaction. The Duncans were among the few humans of these times who could do this. It was understandable, a product of the Duncans’ early training, their sense of personal honor—very chivalrous.\n“I don’t see why you trust women to protect you,” Idaho said. The blood slowly receded from his cheeks. He glared at Leto.\n“But | have always trusted them as | trust you—with my life.”\n“What do we protect you from?”\n“Moneo and my Fish Speakers will bring you up to date.”\nIdaho shifted from one foot to the other, his body swaying in a heartbeat rhythm. He stared around the small room, his eyes not focusing. With the abruptness of sudden decision, he returned his attention to Leto.\n“What do | call you?”\nIt was the sign of acceptance for which Leto had been waiting. “Will Lord Leto do?”\n“Yes ...m’Lord.” Idaho stared directly into Leto’s Fremen- blue eyes. “Is it true what your Fish Speakers say—you have... memories of...”\n“We're all here, Duncan.” Leto spoke it in the voice of his paternal grandfather, then:\n“Even the women are here, Duncan.” It was the voice of Jessica, Leto’s paternal grandmother.\n“You knew them well,” Leto said. “And they know you.”\nIdaho inhaled a slow, trembling breath. “That will take a little getting used to.”\n“My own initial reaction exactly,” Leto said.\nAn explosion of laughter shook Idaho, and Leto thought it more than the weak jest deserved, but he remained silent.\nPresently, Idaho said: “Your Fish Speakers were supposed to put me in a good mood, weren’t they?”\n“Did they succeed?”\nIdaho studied Leto’s face, recognizing the distinctive Atreides features.\n“You Atreides always did know me too well,” Idaho said.\n“That’s better,” Leto said. “You’re beginning to accept that I’m not just one Atreides. I’m all of them.”\n“Paul said that once.”\n“So | did!” As much as the original personality could be conveyed by tone and accent, it was Muad’Dib speaking.\nIdaho gulped, looked away at the room’s door.\n“You've taken something away from us,” he said. “I can feel it. Those women ... Moneo...”\nUs against you, Leto thought. The Duncans always choose the human side.\nIdaho returned his attention to Leto’s face. “What have you given us in exchange?”\n“Throughout the Empire, Leto’s Peace!”\n“And | can see that everyone's delightfully happy! That’s why you need a personal guard.”\nLeto smiled. “My peace is actually enforced tranquility. Humans have a long history of reacting against tranquility.”\n“So you give us the Fish Speakers.”\n“And a hierarchy you can identify without any mistakes.”\n“A female army,” Idaho muttered.\n“The ultimate male-enticing force,” Leto said. “Sex always was a way of subduing the aggressive male.”\n“Is that what they do?”\n“They prevent or ameliorate excesses which could lead to more painful violence.”\n“And you let them believe you’re a god. | don’t think | like this.”\n“The curse of holiness is as offensive to me as it is to you!”\nIdaho frowned. It was not the response he had expected.\n“What kind of game are you playing, Lord Leto?”\n“A very old one but with new rules.”\n“Your rules!”\n“Would you rather | turned it all back to CHOAM and Landsraad and the Great Houses?”\n“The Tleilaxu say there is no more Landsraad. You don’t allow any real self-rule.”\n“Well then, | could step aside for the Bene Gesserit. Or maybe the Ixians or the Tleilaxu? Would you like me to find another Baron Harkonnen to assume power over the Empire? Say the word, Duncan, and l'Il abdicate!”\nUnder this avalanche of meanings, Idaho again shook his head from side to side.\n“In the wrong hands,” Leto said, “monolithic centralized power is a dangerous and volatile instrument.”\n“And your hands are the right ones?”\n“I’m not certain about my hands, but | will tell you, Duncan, I’m certain about the hands of those who’ve gone before me. | know them.”\nIdaho turned his back on Leto.\nWhat a fascinating, ultimately human gesture, Leto thought. Rejection coupled to acceptance of his vulnerability.\nLeto spoke to Idaho’s back.\n“You object quite rightly that | use people without their full knowledge and consent.”\nIdaho turned his profile to Leto, then turned his head to look up at the cowled face, cocking his head forward a bit to peer into the all-blue eyes.\nHe is studying me, Leto thought, but he has only the face to measure me by.\nThe Atreides had taught their people to know the subtle signals of face and body, and Idaho was good at it, but the realization could be seen coming over him: he was beyond his depth here.\nIdaho cleared his throat. “What’s the worst thing you would ask of me?”\nHow like a Duncan! Leto thought. This one was a classic. Idaho would give his loyalty to an Atreides, to the guardian\nof his oath, but he sent a signal that he would not go beyond the personal limits of his own morality.\n“You will be asked to guard me by whatever means necessary, and you will be asked to guard my secret.”\n“What secret?”\n“That | am vulnerable.”\n“That you’re not God?”\n“Not in that ultimate sense.”\n“Your Fish Speakers talk about rebels.”\n“They exist.”\n“Why?”\n“They are young and | have not convinced them that my way is better. It’s very difficult convincing the young of anything. They’re born knowing so much.”\n“| never before heard an Atreides sneer at the young that way.”\n“Perhaps it’s because I’m so much older—old compounded by old. And my task gets more difficult with each passing generation.”\n“What is your task?”\n“You will come to understand it as we go along.”\n“What happens if | fail you? Do your women eliminate me?”\n“I try not to burden the Fish Speakers with guilt.”\n“But you would burden me?”\n“If you accept it.”\n“If | find that you’re worse than the Harkonnens, l'Il turn against you.”\nHow like a Duncan. They measure all evil against the Harkonnens. How little they know of evil.\nLeto said: “The Baron ate whole planets, Duncan. What could be worse than that?”\n“Eating the Empire.”\n“Lam pregnant with my Empire. l'Il die giving birth to it.”\n“If | could believe that...”\n“Will you command my Guard?”\n“Why me?”\n“You're the best.”\n“Dangerous work, l’d imagine. Is that how my predecessors died, doing your dangerous work?”\n“Some of them.”\n“I wish | had the memories of those others!”\n“You couldn’t have and still be the original.”\n“I want to learn about them, though.”\n“You will.”\n“So the Atreides still need a sharp knife?”\n“We have jobs that only a Duncan Idaho can do.”\n“You say...we...” Idaho swallowed, looked at the door, then at Leto’s face.\nLeto spoke to him as Muad’Dib would have, but still in the Leto-voice.\n“When we climbed to Sietch Tabr for the last time together, you had my loyalty then and | had yours. Nothing of that has really changed.”\n“That was your father.”\n“That was me!” Paul Muad’Dib’s voice of command coming from Leto’s bulk always shocked the gholas.\nIdaho whispered: “All of you. ..in that one... body...” He broke off.\nLeto remained silent. This was the decision moment. Presently, Idaho permitted himself that devil-may-care grin for which he had been so well known. “Then | will speak to the first Leto and to Paul, the ones who know me best.\nUse me well, for | did love you.”\nLeto closed his eyes. Such words always distressed him. He knew it was love to which he was most vulnerable.\nMoneo, who had been listening, came to the rescue. He entered and said: “Lord, shall | take Duncan Idaho to the guards he will command?”\n“Yes.” The one word was all that Leto could manage.\nMoneo took Idaho’s arm and led him away.\nGood Moneo, Leto thought. So good. He knows me so well, but | despair of his ever understanding me.\n| know the evil of my ancestors because | am those people.
