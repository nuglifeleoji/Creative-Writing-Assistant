�。男的原来是个猎户，也采些药材，后来周围的林子越来越少，就种地了，但人们还是叫他齐猎头儿。他们有两儿两女，女孩都嫁出去了，一个儿子在外地当兵，另一个成家后与他们一起过，儿媳妇也是刚生了娃。叶文洁这时还没有平反，基地领导很是为难，但也只有这一个办法了，就让他们用雪橇把叶文洁从镇医院接回了家。\n     叶文洁在这个大兴安岭的农家住了半年多，她产后虚弱，没有奶水，这期间，杨冬吃着百家奶长大了。喂她最多的是齐猎头儿的儿媳妇，叫大风，这个健壮的东北妮子，每天吃着高粱米大渣子，同时奶两个娃，奶水还是旺旺的。屯子里其他处于哺乳期的媳妇们也都来喂杨冬，她们很喜欢她，说这娃儿有她**灵气儿。渐渐地，齐猎头儿家成了屯里女人们的聚集地，老的少的，出嫁了的和大闺女，没事儿都爱向这儿跑，她们对叶文洁充满了羡慕和好奇，她也发现自己与她们有很多女人间的话可谈。记不清有多少个晴朗的日子，叶文洁抱着杨冬同屯子里的女人们坐在白桦树柱围成的院子里，旁边有玩耍的孩子和懒洋洋的大黑狗，温暖的阳光拥抱着这一切。她每次都特别注意看那几个举着铜烟袋锅儿的，她们嘴里悠然吐出的烟浸满了阳光，同她们那丰满肌肤上的汗毛一样，发出银亮的柔光。有一次她们中的一位将长长的白钢烟锅递给她，让她“解解乏”，她只抽了两口，就被冲得头晕脑涨，让她们笑了好几天。\n     同男人们叶文洁倒是没什么话说，他们每天关心的事儿她也听不太明白，大意是想趁着政策松下来种些人参，但又不太敢干。他们对叶文洁都很敬重，在她面前彬彬有礼。她最初对此没有在意，但日子长了后，当她看到那些汉子如何粗暴地打老婆，如何同屯里的寡妇打情骂俏时，说出那些让她听半句都脸红的话，才感到这种敬重的珍贵。隔三差五，他们总有人把打到的野兔山鸡什么的送到齐猎头儿家，还给杨冬带来许多自己做的奇特而古朴的玩具。\n     在叶文洁的记忆中，这段日子不像是属于自己的，仿佛是某片从别的人生中飘落的片断，像一片羽毛般飞人自己的生活。这段记忆被浓缩成一幅幅欧洲古典油画，很奇怪，不是中国画，就是油画，中国画上空白太多，但齐家屯的生活是没有空�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
