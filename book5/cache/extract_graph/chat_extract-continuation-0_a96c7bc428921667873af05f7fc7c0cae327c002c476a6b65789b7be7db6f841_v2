海中的身影叠印到画面上，让她位于山谷的深处，看去很小很小；这时汪淼惊奇地发现，整个画面苏醒过来，仿佛照片中的世界认出了那个身影，仿佛这一切本来就是为她而存在。他又依次在想象中将那个身影叠印到另外几幅作品上，有时还将她那双眼睛作为照片上空旷苍穹的背景，那些画面也都苏醒过来，展现出一种汪淼从未想象过的美。以前，汪淼总觉得自己的摄影作品缺少某种灵魂；现在他知道了，缺的是她。\n　　“名单上的这些物理学家，在不到两个月的时间里，先后自杀。”常伟思说。\n　　晴天霹雳，汪淼的大脑一片空白。后来这空白中渐渐有了图像，那是他那些黑白风景照片，照片中的大地没有了她的身影，天空抹去了她的眼睛，那些世界死了。\n　　“是……什么时候?”汪淼呆呆地问。\n　　“在不到两个月的时间里。”常将军重复道。\n　　“你是指最后一位吧。”坐在汪淼旁边的大史得意地说，然后压低声音，“她是最后一位自杀者，前天晚上，服过量安眠药。她死得很顺溜，没有痛苦。”\n　　刹那间，汪淼居然对大史有了那么一丝感激。\n　　“为什么?”汪淼问，那些照片上死去的风景画仍在他的脑海中幻灯似的循环浮现。\n　　常伟思回答道： “现在能肯定的只有一点：促使他们自杀的原因是相同的。但原因本身在这里很难说清，也可能对我们这些非专业人士根本就说不清。文件中附加了他们遗书的部分内容，各位会后可以仔细看看。”\n　　汪淼翻翻那些遗书的复印件，都是长篇大论。\n　　“丁仪博士，您能否把杨冬的遗书给汪教授看一下?她的最简短，也最有概括性。”\n　　那个一直低着头沉默的人半天才有所反应，掏出一个白色的信封隔着桌子递给汪淼，大史在旁边低声说： “他是杨冬的男友。”汪淼这才想起自己在良湘的高能加速器工地中也见过丁仪，他是理论组的成员，这名物理学家因在对球状闪电(注：此处参见作者本人的《球状闪电》。)的研究中发现宏原子而闻名于世。汪淼从信封中抽出一片散发出清香的东西，形状不规则，不是纸，竟是一片白桦树皮，上面有一行娟秀的字：\n　　一切的一切都导向这样一个结果：物理学从来就没有存在过，将来也不会存在。我知道自己这样做是不负责任的，但别无选择。\n　　连签字都没有，她就走了。\n　　“物理学……不存在?”汪淼茫然四顾。\n　　常将军合上文件夹，
