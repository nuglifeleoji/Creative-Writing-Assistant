对面不见。蒋延曰：“此气乃白虹也，主丧兵之兆。太傅只可回朝，不可伐魏。”恪大怒曰：“汝安敢出不利之言，以慢吾军心！”叱武士斩之。众皆告免，恪乃贬蒋延为庶人，仍催兵前进。丁奉曰：“魏以新城为总隘口，若先取得此城，司马师破胆矣。”恪大喜，即趱兵直至新城。守城牙门将军张特，见吴兵大至，闭门坚守。恪令兵四面围定。早有流星马报入洛阳。主簿虞松告司马师曰：“今诸葛恪困新城，且未可与战。吴兵远来，人多粮少，粮尽自走矣。待其将走，然后击之，必得全胜。但恐蜀兵犯境，不可不防。”师然其言，遂令司马昭引一军助郭淮防姜维；毋丘俭、胡遵拒住吴兵。\n\n    却说诸葛恪连月攻打新城不下，下令众将：“并力攻城，怠慢者立斩。”于是诸将奋力攻打。城东北角将陷。张特在城中定下一计：乃令一舌辩之士，赍捧册籍，赴吴寨见诸葛恪，告曰：“魏国之法：若敌人困城，守城将坚守一百日，而无救兵至，然后出城降敌者，家族不坐罪。今将军围城已九十余日；望乞再容数日，某主将尽率军民出城投降。今先具册籍呈上。”恪深信之，收了军马，遂不攻城。原来张特用缓兵之计，哄退吴兵，遂拆城中房屋，于破城处修补完备，乃登城大骂曰：“吾城中尚有半年之粮，岂肯降吴狗耶！尽战无妨！”恪大怒，催兵打城。城上乱箭射下。恪额上正中一箭，翻身落马。诸将救起还寨，金疮举发。众军皆无战心；又因天气亢炎，军士多病。恪金疮稍可，欲催兵攻城。营吏告曰：“人人皆病，安能战乎？”恪大怒曰：“再说病者斩之！”众军闻知，逃者无数。忽报都督蔡林引本部军投魏去了。恪大惊，自乘马遍视各营，果见军士面色黄肿，各带病容。遂勒兵还吴。早有细作报知毋丘俭。俭尽起大兵，随后掩杀。\n\n    吴兵大败而归，恪甚羞惭，托病不朝。吴主孙亮自幸其宅问安，文武官僚皆来拜见。恪恐人议论，先搜求众官将过失，轻则发遣边方，重则斩首示众。于是内外官僚，无不悚惧。又令心腹将张约、朱恩管御林军。以为牙爪。却说孙峻字子远，乃孙坚弟孙静曾孙，孙恭之子也；孙权存日，甚爱之，命掌御林军马。今闻诸�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
