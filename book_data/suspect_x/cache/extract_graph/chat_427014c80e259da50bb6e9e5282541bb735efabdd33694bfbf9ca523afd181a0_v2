He spoke without looking at her: “Would you please leave me now?”\nSo he saw through her overtures!\nShe should have anticipated that, Teg being who he was. Lucilla knew she might still seduce him. No Reverend Mother of her training should fail, not even with a Mentat of Teg’s obvious powers.\nLucilla stood there a moment undecided, her mind automatically planning how to circumvent this preliminary rejection. Something stopped her. Not anger at the rejection, not the remote possibility that he might indeed be proof against her wiles. Pride and its possible fall (there was always that possibility) had little to do with it.\nDignity.\nThere was a quiet dignity in Teg and she had the certain knowledge of what his courage and prowess had already given to the Sisterhood. Not quite sure of her motives, Lucilla turned away from him. Possibly it was the underlying gratitude that the Sisterhood felt toward him. To seduce Teg now would be demeaning, not only of him but of herself. She could not bring herself to such an action, not without a direct order from a superior.\nAs she stood on the parapet, some of these memories clouded her senses. There was movement in the shadows at the doorway from the Weapons Wing. Teg could be glimpsed there. Lucilla took a firmer grip on her responses and focused on Duncan. The ghola had stopped his controlled tumbling across the lawn. He stood quietly, breathing deeply, his attention aimed upward at Lucilla. She saw perspiration on his face and in dark blotchings on his light blue singlesuit.\nLeaning over the parapet, Lucilla called down to him: “That was very good, Duncan. Tomorrow, | will begin teaching you more of the foot-fist combinations.”\nThe words came out of her without censoring and she knew their source at once. They were for Teg standing in the Shadowed doorway down there, not for the ghola. She was saying to Teg: “See! You aren’t the only one who teaches him deadly abilities.”\nLucilla realized then that Teg had insinuated himself further into her psyche than she should permit. Grimly, she swung her gaze to the tall figure emerging from the doorway’s shadows. Duncan already was running toward the Bashar.\nAs Lucilla focused on Teg, reaction flashed through her ignited by the most elemental Bene Gesserit responses. The steps of this reaction could be defined later: Something wrong! Danger! Teg is not Teg! In the reactive flash,\nhowever, none of this took separate form. She responded, hurling all the volume of Voice she could muster:\n“Duncan! Down!”\nDuncan dropped flat on the grass, his attention riveted to the Teg-figure emerging from the Weapons Wing. There was a field-model lasgun in the man’s hands.\nFace Dancer! Lucilla thought. Only hyperalertness revealed him to her. One of the new ones!\n“Face Dancer!” Lucilla shouted.\nDuncan kicked himself sideways and leaped up, twisting flat in the air at least a meter off the ground. The speed of his reaction shocked Lucilla. She had not known any human could move that fast! The lasgun’s first bolt cut beneath Duncan as he seemed to float in the air.\nLucilla jumped to the parapet and dropped to a handhold on the window ledge of the next lower level. Before she was stopped, her right hand shot out and found the protruding rainspout that memory told her was there. Her body arched sideways and she dropped to a window ledge at the next level. Desperation drove her even though she knew she would be too late.\nSomething crackled on the wall above her. She saw a molten line cut toward her as she flung herself to the left, twisting and dropping onto the lawn. Her gaze captured the scene around her in a flashing deit-grasp as she landed.\nDuncan moved toward the attacker, dodging and twisting in a terrifying replay of his practice session. The speed of his movements!\nLucilla saw indecision in the face of the false Teg.\nShe darted toward the Face Dancer, feeling the creature’s thoughts: Two of them after me!\nFailure was inevitable, though, and Lucilla knew it even as she ran. The Face Dancer had only to shift his weapon into full burn at close range. He could lace the air in front of him. Nothing could penetrate such a defense. As she cast about in her mind, desperately seeking some way to defeat the\nattacker, she saw red smoke appear on the false Teg’s breast. A line of red darted upward at an oblique angle through the muscles of the arm holding the lasgun. The arm fell away like a piece dropping from a statue. The shoulder tipped away from the torso in a spout of blood. The figure toppled, dissolving into more red smoke and blood spray, crumbling into pieces on the steps, all dark tans and blue- tinged reds.\nLucilla smelled the distinctive Face Dancer pheromones as she stopped. Duncan came up beside her. He peered past the dead Face Dancer at movement in the hallway.\nAnother Teg emerged behind the dead one. Lucilla identified the reality: Teg himself.\n“That’s the Bashar,” Duncan said.\nLucilla experienced a small surge of pleasure that Duncan had learned this identity-lesson so well: how to recognize your friends even if you only saw bits of them. She pointed to the dead Face Dancer. “Smell him.”\nDuncan inhaled. “Yes, | have it. But he wasn’t a very good copy. | saw what he was as soon as you did.”\nTeg emerged into the courtyard carrying a heavy lasgun cradled across his left arm. His right hand held a firm grip on the stock and trigger. He swept his gaze around the courtyard, then focused on Duncan and finally on Lucilla.\n“Bring Duncan inside,” Teg said.\nIt was the order of a battlefield commander, depending only on superior knowledge of what should be done in the emergency. Lucilla obeyed without question.\nDuncan did not speak as she led him by the hand past the bloody meat that had been the Face Dancer, then into the Weapons Wing. Once inside, he glanced back at the sodden heap and asked: “Who let him in?”\nNot: “How did he get in?” she observed. Duncan already had seen past the inconsequentials to the heart of their problem.\nTeg strode ahead of them toward his own quarters. He stopped at the door, glanced inside and motioned for Lucilla and Duncan to follow.\nIn Teg’s bedroom there was the thick smell of burned flesh and wisps of smoke dominated by the charred barbecue odor that Lucilla so detested: cooked human meat! A figure in one of Teg’s uniforms lay face down on the floor where it had fallen off his bed.\nTeg rolled the figure over with one boot toe, exposing the face: staring eyes, a rictus grin. Lucilla recognized one of the perimeter guards, one of those who had come to the Keep with Schwangyu, so the Keep’s records said.\n“Their point man,” Teg said. “Patrin took care of him and we put one of my uniforms on him. It was enough to fool the Face Dancers because we didn’t let them see the face before we attacked. They didn’t have time to make a memory print.”\n“You know about that?” Lucilla was startled.\n“Bellonda briefed me thoroughly!”\nAbruptly, Lucilla saw the further significance of what Teg said. She suppressed a swift flare of anger. “How did you let one of them get into the courtyard?”\nHis voice mild, Teg said: “There was rather urgent activity in here. | had to make a choice, which turned out to be the right one.”\nShe did not try to hide her anger. “The choice to let Duncan fend for himself?”\n“To leave him in your care or let other attackers get themselves firmly entrenched inside. Patrin and | had a bad time clearing this wing. We had our hands full.” Teg glanced at Duncan. “He came through very well, thanks to our training.”\n“That... that thing almost got him!”\n“Lucilla!” Teg shook his head. “I had it timed. You two could last at least a minute out there. | knew you would\nthrow yourself in that thing’s path and sacrifice yourself to save Duncan. Another twenty seconds.”\nAt Teg’s words, Duncan turned a shiny-eyed look on Lucilla. “Would you have done that?”\nWhen Lucilla did not respond, Teg said: “She would have done that.”\nLucilla did not deny it. She remembered now, though, the incredible speed with which Duncan had moved, the dazzling shifts of his attack.\n“Battle decisions,” Teg said, looking at Lucilla.\nShe accepted this. As usual, Teg had made the correct choice. She knew, though, that she would have to communicate with Taraza. The prana-bindu accelerations in this ghola went beyond anything she had expected. She stiffened as Teg straightened to full alert, his gaze on the doorway behind her. Lucilla whirled.\nSchwangyu stood there, Patrin behind her, another heavy lasgun over his arm. Its muzzle, Lucilla noted, was aimed at Schwangyu.\n“She insisted,” Patrin said. There was an angry set to the old aide’s face. The deep lines beside his mouth pointed downward.\n“There’s a trail of bodies clear out to the south pillbox,” Schwangyu said. “Your people won’t let me out there to inspect. | command you to countermand those orders immediately.”\n“Not until my clean-up crews are finished,” Teg said.\n“They’re still killing people out there! | can hear it!” A venomous edge had entered Schwangyu’s voice. She glared at Lucilla.\n“We're also questioning people out there,” Teg said.\nSchwangyu shifted her glare to Teg. “If it’s too dangerous here then we will take the . . . the child to my quarters. Now!”\n“We will not do that,” Teg said. His tone was low-key but positive.\nSchwangyu stiffened with displeasure. Patrin’s knuckles went white on the stock of his lasgun. Schwangyu swung her gaze past the gun and up to Lucilla’s appraising stare. The two women looked into each other’s eyes.\nTeg allowed the moment to hold for a beat, then said: “Lucilla, take Duncan into my sitting room.” He nodded toward a door behind him.\nLucilla obeyed, pointedly keeping her body between Schwangyu and Duncan the whole time.\nOnce behind the closed door, Duncan said: “She almost called me ‘the ghola.’ She’s really upset.”\n“Schwangyu has let several things slip past her guard,” Lucilla said.\nShe glanced around Teg’s sitting room, her first view of this part of his quarters: the Bashar’s inner sanctum. It reminded her of her own quarters—that same mixture of orderliness and casual disarray. Reading spools lay ina clutter on a small table beside an old-fashioned chair upholstered in soft gray. The spool reader had been swung aside as though its user had just stepped out for a moment, intending to return soon. A Bashar’s black uniform jacket lay across a nearby hard chair with sewing material in a small open box atop it. The jacket’s cuff showed a carefully patched hole.\nSo he does his own mending.\nThis was an aspect of the famous Miles Teg she had not expected. If she had thought about it, she would have said Patrin would absorb such chores.\n“Schwangyu let the attackers in, didn’t she?” Duncan asked.\n“Her people did.” Lucilla did not hide her anger. “She has gone too far\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_427014c80e259da50bb6e9e5282541bb735efabdd33694bfbf9ca523afd181a0_v2"}
