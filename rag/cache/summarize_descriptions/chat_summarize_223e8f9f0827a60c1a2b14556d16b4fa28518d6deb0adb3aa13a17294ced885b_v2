From a young age, Duke Leto groomed Paul to succeed him, preparing him not only to inherit the title of Duke but also to develop the strategic and analytical skills of a Mentatâ€”a human computer capable of advanced reasoning. Their relationship was one of mentorship and legacy, with Leto ensuring Paul was equipped to lead their House with wisdom and strength.  \n\nFollowing Duke Leto's murder on the desert planet Arrakis, Paul inherited his father's title and the responsibilities of House Atreides, carrying forward his legacy. As the new Duke, Paul faced immense challenges, including political intrigue and warfare, but his upbringing under Leto's guidance helped shape him into a formidable leader. The bond between father and son was central to Paul's development, as Leto's teachings and sacrifices laid the foundation for Paul's eventual rise to power.  \n\nIn summary, Paul Atreides is the rightful heir of Duke Leto Atreides, trained to uphold the honor and leadership of House Atreides.
