从宿舍走向区队办公楼准备下井的时候，一路上望着矿区闪烁的灯火，望着满天繁密的星斗，猛然感到了一种突发的激动，以致都情不自禁地微笑起来了。 \n                  第37章\n　　不久以后，孙少平出人意料地被提拔为班长。不过，不是在他原来干活的采煤一班，而是到采煤二班去当班长。这个班老工人很少，大部分是新招来的协议工。 \n　　协议工可不是好领导的！他们一般合同期为三年，仍然保持农民身份，只不过在煤矿赚三年工资罢了；因此，很多人对煤矿没什么主人翁感，反正三年后就又得回去当农民，能混着赚几个钱就行了；别说为煤矿舍命，最好连一点皮也别擦破！ \n　　副区长雷汉义竭力推荐他当这个班长。理由倒不全是他吃苦精神强，而主要是说他能打架，可能帅住这群踢腿骡子。区队其他领导都同意。也是！没有一种膘悍性，就别想当班长——这向来是煤矿选择班长的传统条件之一。孙少平要调到采煤二班当班长的决定宣布后，一班的人倒都觉得十分正常。这小子是当官的料，大家心服口服。 \n　　只是一班的蛮汉安锁子找区长哭了一鼻子，说他要跟少平到二班去当斧子工。锁子被少平一顿老拳饱打之后，倒打成了真正的师兄弟。这个笨熊一样的家伙，现在舍不得离开孙少平，他感到跟上少平既不受气，又很痛快，也不会被人捉弄——尽管他常捉弄人，但又生怕别人捉弄他；要是井下被人捉弄可不是开玩笑的，常常意味着你得多流汗，甚至一个恶作剧就得让你出点血！ \n　　少平也对这个愚兄有了些感情。在他的请求下，安锁子如愿以偿跟他到了二班。当然，安师兄干活时为他卖力是没有疑问的；同时还可以帮他在掌了面上“镇压”某些调皮捣蛋的协议工。当班长没几个好斧子工相帮，你就别想完成生产任务！ \n　　这煤矿上的班长和军队上的班长一样，实际上不是个啥官，只是个“上等列兵”罢了。同样，又象军队上的班长一样，总是在最激烈的前线冲锋陷阵——这意味着要带头吃苦，带头牺牲。 \n　　人数上，煤矿的班可比军队上的班大得多。孙少平领导的二班就有六十多人。其中协议工占了百分之八十。他们就象部队刚入伍的新兵，需要锻炼才能适应战斗的要求。这无疑给班长增加了大量的工作负担。 \n　　孙少平是个有文化的人，因此他尽量使自己把班长当得文雅一些。但在井下这种紧张激烈，时时充满危险的劳动环境中，他一急，\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
