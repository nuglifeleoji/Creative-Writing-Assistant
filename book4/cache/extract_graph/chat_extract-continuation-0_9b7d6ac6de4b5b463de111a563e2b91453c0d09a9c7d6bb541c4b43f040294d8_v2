\n　　这时候，根据新的行政区划，水库所在地的区域归属了省会所在市。市上决定，在这个一万二千亩的坝地上建立一个国营农场，职工逐步扩大到了六百人。沧海桑田，当年万顷绿波变成了金色的麦浪。这里先后起楼盖房，出现了商店、医院、俱乐部和学校……在这些漫长的年月里，当年那些迁走的老乡，不时从几百里路上来到这里。通常都是一些老者带着一些青年和小孩，在这里转悠几天；晚上，他们就分别露宿在一个固定的地方。这是一种悲伤的“寻根”活动。当年这里搬走的那些老人，几乎都已客死他乡。现在的这些老者，那时还都是青壮年，可是，二十来个年头过去了，他们仍然在怀念这块母土。母土啊！对于一个人来说，永远都不可能在感情上割断；尤其是一个农民，他们对祖辈生息的土地有一种宗教般神圣的感情。现在，他们要带着自己的儿孙来这里寻找他们生命的根。 \n　　所有这些人都能根据周围的环境，准确地追寻到他们当年老住宅的所在地。他们一般都要在那地方露宿几天，才含着泪水带着痛苦，怅然若失地离开了。不用说，他们对这里的农场职工怀着一种仇视的心理。在他们看来，这是自己的地方啊！怎么能让这些陌生人盘踞在自己的土地上耕作和收获呢？ \n　　八○年以后，随着整个国家政策的放宽和改变，一场酝酿已久的危机开始在这里露出了苗头。有个把外迁的乡民，把“寻根”活动放在了农场的收麦季节。他们甚至携儿带女，就在周围搭个窝棚，开始抢收农场的麦子。农场职工劝阻不下，结果发生了多起斗殴事件。 \n　　到了一九八二年夏天，此类事件愈演愈烈，更多的外迁乡民涌到了周围，纷纷安营扎寨，开始哄抢着收割农场的麦子。这一年，农场损失了三分之一的粮食，事件反映到了市委。但市上拿不出行之有效的办法。派去的几个公安人员，被乡民们打得鼻青眼肿回来了。逮捕闹事者吗？闹事者有几百人，该逮捕谁？市委的这种无所作为的态度，终于导致了不可收拾的局面。 \n　　在此期间，从黑龙河库区迁往铜城周围的乡民中，有几位“领袖”人物组成了“返乡委员会”，发起了一个颇有声势的回乡运动。当年迁出的几千口人现已繁衍成了几万，“委员会”的号召如干柴上浇油，立刻燃起了一片大火！今年一入夏，黑龙河农场的麦子还没完全成熟的时候，上千愤怒的人就从铜城涌到了这里，一\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
