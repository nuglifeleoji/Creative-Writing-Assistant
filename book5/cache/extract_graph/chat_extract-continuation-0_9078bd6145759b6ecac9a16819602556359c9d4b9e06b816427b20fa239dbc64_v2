大地已经像一块炉中的铁板一样被烧得通红，发出暗红色光的地面上流淌着一条条明亮的岩浆小溪，织成一张伸向天边的亮丽的火网。红炽的大地上有无数根细长的火柱高高腾起，这是干仓在燃烧，仓中的脱水人使火柱染上了一种奇异的蓝绿色。汪淼看到不远处有十几根同样颜色的小火柱，这是刚从金字塔中跑出来的十几个人：教皇、伽利略、亚历士多德、达·芬奇……包裹他们的蓝绿色火柱是透明的，可以看到他们的面容和躯体在火中缓缓地变形，他们把目光聚焦在刚出来的汪淼身上，都保持着同一个姿势，向着天空举起熊熊燃烧的双臂，用歌唱般的声音齐声颂道：\n   “三日凌空——”\n   汪淼抬头望去，看到三轮巨大的太阳在天空中围绕着一个看不见的原点缓缓地转动着，像一轮巨大的风扇将死亡之风吹向大地。几乎占据全部天空的三日正在向西移去，很快有一半沉到了地平线之下。“风扇”仍在旋转，一片灿烂的叶片不时划出地平线，给这个已经毁灭的世界带来一次次短暂的日出和日落，日落后灼热的大地发出暗红的光芒，转瞬而来的日出又用平射的强光淹没了一切。三日完全落下之后，大地上升腾的水蒸气形成的浓云仍散射着它的光芒，天空在然烧，呈现出一种令人疯狂的地狱之美。当这毁灭的晚霞最后消失，云层中只有被大地的地狱之火抹上的一层血红时，几行大字出现了：\n
