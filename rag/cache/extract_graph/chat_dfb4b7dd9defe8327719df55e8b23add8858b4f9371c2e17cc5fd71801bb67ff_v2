But even by the time of Liet Kynes, the first planetologist here, the original stars painted on that ceiling had been gone, lost in the tiny rock chippings of small quakes and the everyday abrasions of life.\nOdrade’s breath quickened. The sense of peril had never been greater. The danger beacon shone within her! Quickly, she trotted directly across to the steps where she had descended to this floor. Turning there, she cast backward in her mind for Other Memories to limn this place. They came Slowly, forcing past that heart-pounding sense of doom. Pointing the beam of her light upward and peering along it, Odrade placed those ancient memories over the scene in front of her.\nBits of reflected brilliance!\nOther Memories positioned them: indicators of the stars in a long-gone sky and right there! The silvery-yellow half circle of the Arrakeen sun. She knew it for a sunset sign.\nThe Fremen day starts at night.\nArafel!\nKeeping her light on that sunset marker, she mounted the steps backward and went around the chamber on the ledge to the exact position she had seen in Other Memories.\nNothing remained of that ancient sun arc.\nSearchers had chipped at the wall where it had been. Stone bubbles glistened where a burner had been passed\nalong the wall. No breaks entered the original rock.\nBy the tightness in her chest, Odrade knew she teetered on the edge of a dangerous discovery. The beacon had led her here!\nArafel...at the edge of the universe. Beyond the setting sun!\nShe swept her light right and left. Another passage entrance opened on her left. Stones that had blocked it lay scattered on the ledge. Her heart pounding, Odrade slipped through the opening and found a short hall plugged with melted stone at the end. On her right, directly behind where the sunset marker had been, she found a small room thick with the smell of melange. Odrade entered the room and Saw more signs of chipping and burning on walls and ceiling. The danger sense was oppressive here. She chanted the Litany Against Fear silently while she swept the beam of her light over the room. The place was almost square, about two meters on a side. The ceiling was less than half a meter above her head. Cinnamon pulsed in her nostrils. She sneezed and, blinking, saw a tiny discoloration on the floor beside the threshold.\nMore marks of that ancient search?\nBending close with her light held at a sharp angle on one side, she saw that she had glimpsed only the shadow of something etched deeply into the rock. Dust concealed most of it. She knelt and brushed the dust aside. Very thin etching and very deep. Whatever this was, it had been meant to endure. The last message of a lost Reverend Mother? This was a known Bene Gesserit artifice. She pressed sensitive fingertips against the etching and reconstructed its tracery in her mind.\nRecognition leaped into her awareness: one word— inscribed in ancient Chakobsa, “Here.”\nThis was no ordinary “here” to mark an ordinary place but the accented and emphatic “here” that said: “You have found me!” Her hammering heart emphasized it.\nOdrade rested her handlight on the floor near her right knee and let her fingers explore the threshold beside that ancient summons. The stonework appeared unbroken to the eye but her fingers detected a tiny discontinuity. She pressed the discontinuity, twisted, turned, changed the angle of pressure several times and repeated her effort.\nNothing.\nSitting back on her heels, Odrade studied the situation.\n“Here.”\nThe warning sense had grown even more acute. She could feel it as a pressure on her breathing.\nWithdrawing slightly, she pulled her light back and lay full length on the floor to stare narrowly along the base of the threshold. Here! Could she place a tool there beside that word and lever the threshold? No...a tool was not indicated. This thing had the smell of the Tyrant, not of a Reverend Mother. She tried to push the threshold sideways. Nothing moved.\nFeeling the tensions and danger sense accentuated by frustration, Odrade stood and kicked at the threshold beside the etched word. It moved! Something grated roughly against sand over her head.\nOdrade dodged backward as sand cascaded onto the floor in front of her. A deep rumbling sound filled the tiny chamber. The stones shook under her feet. The floor tipped downward in front of her toward the doorway, opening a Space under the door and its wall.\nOnce more, Odrade found herself precipitated forward and down into an unknown. Her light tumbled with her, its beam rolling over and over. She saw mounds of dark reddish brown in front of her. Cinnamon filled her nostrils.\nShe fell beside her light onto a soft mounding of melange. The opening through which she had fallen lay out of reach some five meters overhead. She grabbed up her light. Its beam picked out wide stone steps cut into the rock beside the opening. Something written on the risers but she saw\nonly that there was a way out. Her first panic subsided, but the sense of danger left her almost breathless, forcing the movements of her chest muscles.\nLeft and right she sent the beam of her light into this place where she had fallen. It was a long room directly beneath the passage she had taken from the great chamber. The entire length of it was piled with melange!\nOdrade probed upward with her light and saw why no searcher tapping on that passage floor overhead had detected this chamber. Criss-crossed rock bracings transferred all strain deep into the stone walls. Anyone tapping overhead would get back the sounds of solid rock.\nOnce more, Odrade looked at the melange around her. Even at today’s tank-deflated prices, she knew she was standing on a treasure. This hoard would measure many long tons.\nIs that the danger?\nThe warning sense within her remained just as acute as ever. The Tyrant’s melange was not what she should fear. The triumvirate would make an equitable distribution of this lot and that would be the end of it. A bonus in the ghola project.\nAnother danger remained. She could not avoid the warning.\nAgain, she sent the light beam along the mounded melange. Her attention was drawn to the strip of wall above the spice. More words! Still in Chakobsa, written with a cutter in a fine flowing script, there was another message:\n“A REVEREND MOTHER WILL READ MY WORDS!”\nSomething cold settled in Odrade’s guts. She moved to her right with the light, plowing through an empire’s ransom in melange. There was more to the message:\n“| BEQUEATH TO YOU MY FEAR AND LONELINESS. TO YOU | GIVE THE CERTAINTY THAT THE BODY AND SOUL OF THE BENE GESSERIT WILL MEET THE SAME FATE AS ALL OTHER BODIES AND ALL OTHER SOULS.”\nAnother paragraph of the message backoned to the right of this one. She plowed through the cloying melange and stopped to read.\n“WHAT IS SURVIVAL IF YOU DO NOT SURVIVE WHOLE? ASK THE BENE TLEILAX THAT! WHAT IF YOU NO LONGER HEAR THE MUSIC OF LIFE? MEMORIES ARE NOT ENOUGH UNLESS THEY CALL YOU TO NOBLE PURPOSE!”\nThere was more of it on the narrow end wall of the long chamber. Odrade stumbled through the melange and knelt to read:\n“WHY DID YOUR SISTERHOOD NOT BUILD THE GOLDEN PATH? YOU KNEW THE NECESSITY. YOUR FAILURE CONDEMNED ME, THE GOD EMPEROR, TO MILLENNIA OF PERSONAL DESPAIR.”\nThe words “God Emperor” were not in Chakobsa but in the language of the Islamiyat, where they conveyed an explicit second meaning to any speaker of that tongue:\n“Your God and Your Emperor because you made me so.”\nOdrade smiled grimly. That would drive Waff into a religious frenzy! The higher he went, the easier to shatter his security.\nShe did not doubt the accuracy of the Tyrant’s accusation, nor the potential in his prediction that the Sisterhood could end. The sense of danger had led her to this place unerringly. Something more had been at work, too. The worms of Rakis still moved to the Tyrant’s ancient beat. He might slumber in his endless dream but monstrous life, a pearl in each worm to remind it, carried on as the Tyrant had predicted.\nWhat was it he had told the Sisterhood in his own time? She recalled his words:\n“When | am gone, they must call me Shaitan, Emperor of Gehenna. The wheel must turn and turn along the Golden Path.”\nYes—that was what Taraza had meant. “But don’t you see? The common people of Rakis have been calling him\nShaitan for more than a thousand years!”\nSo Taraza had known this thing. Without ever seeing these words, she had known.\n| see your design, Taraza. And now | know the burden of fear you have carried all these years. | can feel it every bit as deeply as you do.\nOdrade knew then that this warning sense would not leave until she ended, or the Sisterhood vanished from existence, or the peril was resolved.\nOdrade lifted her light, got to her feet and slogged through the melange to the wide steps out of this place. At the steps, she recoiled. More of the Tyrant’s words had been cut into each riser. Trembling, she read them as they moved upward to the opening.\n“MY WORDS ARE YOUR PAST,\n“MY QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLE:\n“WITH WHOM DO YOU ALLY?\n“WITH THE SELF-IDOLATORS OF TLEILAX?\n“WITH MY FISH SPEAKER BUREAUCRACY?\n“WITH THE COSMOS-WANDERING GUILD?\n“WITH HARKONNEN BLOOD SACRIFICERS?\n“WITH A DOGMATIC SINK OF YOUR OWN CREATION?\n“HOW WILL YOU MEET YOUR END?\n“AS NO MORE THAN A SECRET SOCIETY?”\nOdrade climbed past the questions, reading them a second time as she went. Noble purpose? What a fragile thing that always was. And how easily distorted. But the power was there immersed in constant peril. It was all spelled out on the walls and stairs of that chamber. Taraza knew without having it explained. The Tyrant’s meaning was Clear:\n“Join me!”\nAs she emerged into the small room, finding a narrow ledge along which she could swing herself to the door, Odrade looked down at the treasure she had found. She shook her head in wonder at Taraza’s wisdom. So that was\nhow the Sisterhood might end. Taraza’s design was clear, all the pieces in place. Nothing certain. Wealth and power, it was all the same in the end. The noble design had been started and it must be completed even if that meant the death of the Sisterhood.\nWhat poor tools we have chosen!\nThat girl waiting back there in the deep chamber below the desert, that girl and the ghola being prepared on Rakis.\n| speak your language now, old worm. It has no words but | know the heart of it.\nOur fathers ate manna in the desert,\nIn the burning place where whirlwinds came. Lord, save us from that horrible land! Save us, oh-h-h-h-h save us From that dry and thirsty land.\n—SONGS OF GURNEY HALLECK, MUSEUM OF DAR-ES-BALAT\nTa and Duncan, both heavily armed, emerged from the no-globe with Luc\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_dfb4b7dd9defe8327719df55e8b23add8858b4f9371c2e17cc5fd71801bb67ff_v2"}
