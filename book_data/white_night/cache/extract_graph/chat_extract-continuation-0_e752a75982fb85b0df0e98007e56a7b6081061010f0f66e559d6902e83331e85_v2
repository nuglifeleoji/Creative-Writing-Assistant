叶灵瞳原本看着蓝轩宇用手来抓自己的脚，心中顿时一阵不屑，虽然她是女生，可在天罡霸体状态下，她有绝对的信心，别说是蓝轩宇，就算是他们强攻系最有力量的学员在力量上也是远远不如的。\n\n    可是，蓝轩宇的手就那么抓住了，当她的脚掌和蓝轩宇右手碰触的一瞬间。她只觉得自己仿佛踢中的是一块铁板。紧接着，一种发自灵魂深处的颤栗瞬间迸发，从接触到蓝轩宇的左脚开始，酥麻酸软瞬间传遍全身，她只是轻哼一声，整个人就像一条无骨蛇一般瞬间软了下去。\n\n    蓝轩宇原本左手已经抬起来，水元素蓄势待发。可他也没想到，那么强势的叶灵瞳会突然软倒，这会儿就变成他右手抓着叶灵瞳的脚，提着她的身体在那里。\n\n    这突如其来的变化老师们也是吓了一跳，蓝轩宇几乎是下意识的就把自己右手的金纹蓝银草收了回去。\n\n    一切变化都特别快，以至于老师们也没看清楚发生了什么。\n\n    蓝轩宇一松手，已经软倒在地的叶灵瞳总算是全身落地了，但那种强烈的心悸依旧萦绕在心头，令她大口、大口的喘息着。\n\n    龚英豪赶忙跑过去，“灵瞳，你没事吧？”\n\n    秋雨馨也到了近前，她是女老师，更方便一些，立刻检查起叶灵瞳的身体。\n\n    蓝轩宇有些发呆的站在一边，而同学们看着他的眼神都变得有些古怪起来。\n\n    尤其是一年级一班这些强攻系的学生们。\n\n    先前蓝轩宇战胜黄启帆就算了，他们也没觉得什么，可是，叶灵瞳不一样啊！那不但是他们的班长，而且在班里一直非常强势，绝对是打遍全班无敌手的存在。\n\n    更何况，这可不是第一次了啊！输了无所谓，可每一次她输的都显得特别莫名其妙。\n\n    黄启帆这会儿站在同学们身边，喃喃的低声道：“班长不会是喜欢蓝轩宇吧？这是故意让的吧？”\n\n    “班长喜欢蓝轩宇！”旁边立刻就有个女生跟着叫了一句。顿时，一班的同学们立刻有些躁动起来。\n\n    叶灵瞳这会儿终于缓过来了，没有谁比她更郁闷，怎么就输了？凭什么啊！明明自己的力量足够大，那一脚应该可以克敌制胜的，蓝轩宇都已经失去平衡了，一脚踢过去，他被踹飞才正常啊！为什么软倒的又是自己，自己这个天罡龙武\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
