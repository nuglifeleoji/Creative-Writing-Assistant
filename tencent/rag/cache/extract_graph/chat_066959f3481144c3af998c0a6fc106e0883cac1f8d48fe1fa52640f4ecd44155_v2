Not so?”\n“That order is reserved for keeping our secrets from the hands of enemies.”\n“Is that why you want your own Face Dancers? Do you consider us enemies?”\nBefore he could compose a response, Bellonda’s projected figure appeared above the table, lifesize and partly translucent, dancing crystals of Archives behind her. “Urgent from Sheeana!” Bellonda said. “The spice blow has occurred. Sandworms!” The figure turned and looked at Scytale, comeyes perfectly coordinating her movements. “So you have lost a bargaining chip, Master Scytale! We have our spice at last!” The projected figure vanished with an audible click and a faint smell of ozone.\n“You're trying to trick me!” he blurted.\nBut the door at Odrade’s left opened. Sheeana entered towing a small Suspensor pod no more than two meters long. Its transparent sides repeated the glowglobes of the workroom in tiny bursts of yellow light. Something squirmed in the pod!\nSheeana stood aside without speaking, giving them a full view of the contents. So small! The worm was less than half the length of its container but perfect in every detail, stretched out there on a shallow bed of golden sand.\nScytale could not contain a gasp of awe. The Prophet!\nOdrade’s reaction was pragmatic. She bent close to the pod, peering into the miniature mouth. The scorching huff- huff of a great worm’s internal fires reduced to this? What a tiny mimicry!\nCrystal teeth flashed as it lifted its front segments.\nThe worm sent its mouth questing left and right. They all saw behind the teeth the miniature fire in its alien chemistry.\n“Thousands of them,” Sheeana said. “They came to a spice blow as they always do.”\nOdrade remained silent. We have done it! But this was Sheeana’s moment of triumph. Let her make the most of it. Scytale had never looked this defeated.\nSheeana opened the pod and lifted the worm from it, cradling it as though it were an infant. It lay quiescent in her arms.\nOdrade took a deep, satisfied breath. She still controls them.\n“Scytale,” Odrade said. He could not take his gaze from the worm.\n“Do you still serve the Prophet?” Odrade asked. “There he is!”\nHe did not know how to respond. Truly a revenant of the Prophet? He wanted to deny his first awed response but his eyes would not permit it.\nOdrade spoke softly. “While you were out on your foolish mission, your se/fish mission, we were serving the Prophet! We rescued his last revenant and brought him here. Chapterhouse will become another Dune!”\nShe sat back and steepled her hands in front of her. Bell was watching through the comeyes, of course. A Mentat’s observations would be valuable. Odrade wished Idaho were also watching. But he could look at a holo. It was clear to her that Scytale had seen the Bene Gesserit only as tools for restoration of his precious Tleilaxu civilization. Would this development force him to reveal inner secrets of his tanks? What would he offer?\n“I must have time to think.” A tremor in his voice.\n“About what would you think?”\nHe did not answer but kept his attention on Sheeana, who was replacing the tiny worm in its pod. She stroked it once before sealing the lid.\n“Tell me, Scytale,” Odrade insisted. “How can there be anything for you to reconsider? This is our Prophet! You say you serve the Great Belief. Then serve it!”\nShe could see his dreams dissolving. His own Face Dancers to print memories of those they killed, copying each victim’s shape and manner. He had never hoped to gull a Reverend Mother... but acolytes and simple workers of Chapterhouse ... all the secrets he had hoped to acquire, gone! Lost as certainly as the charred husks of Tleilaxu planets.\nOur Prophet, she said. He turned a stricken look toward Odrade but did not focus. What am I to do? These women no longer need me. But | need them!\n“Scytale.” How softly she spoke. “The Great Convention is ended. It’s a new universe out there.”\nHe tried to swallow in a dry throat. The whole concept of violence had taken on a new dimension. In the Old Empire, the Convention had guaranteed retaliation against anyone who dared burn a planet by attacking from space.\n“Escalated violence, Scytale.” Odrade’s voice was almost a whisper. “We Scatter pods of rage.”\nHe focused on her. What is she saying?\n“The hatred being stored up against Honored Matres,” She said. You are not the only one with losses, Scytale. Once, when problems arose in our civilization, the cry went out: “Bring a Reverend Mother!” Honored Matres prevent that. And the myths are recomposed. Golden light is cast upon our past. “It was better in the old days when the Bene Gesserit could help us. Where do you go for reliable Truthsayers these days? Arbitration? These Honored Matres have never heard the word! They were always courteous, the Reverend Mothers. You have to say that for them.”\nWhen Scytale did not respond, she said: “Think of what might happen if that rage were loosed in a Jihad!”\nWhen he still did not speak, she said: “You have seen it. Tleilaxu, Bene Gesserit, priests of the Divided God, and who knows how many more—all hunted like wild game.”\n“They cannot kill us all!” An agonized cry.\n“Can't they? Your Scattered ones made common cause with Honored Matres. Is that a sanctuary you would seek in the Scattering?”\nAnd there goes another dream: Little pods of Tleilaxu, persistent as festering sores, awaiting the day of Scytale’s Great Revival.\n“People grow strong under oppression,” he said, but there was no force in his words. “Even the Priests of Rakis are\nfinding holes in which to hide!” Desperate words.\n“Who says this? Some of your returned friends?”\nHis silence was all the answer she needed.\n“Bene Tleilax have killed Honored Matres and they know it,” she said, hammering at him. “They will be satisfied only with your extermination.”\n“And yours!”\n“We are partners by necessity if not by shared belief.” She said it in purest Islamiyat and saw hope leap into his eyes. Kehl and Shariat may yet take on their old meanings among people who compose their thoughts in the Language of God.\n“Partners?” Faint and extremely tentative.\nShe adopted new bluntness. “In some ways, that’s a more reliable basis for common action than any other. Each of us knows what the other wants. An instrinsic design: Screen everything through that and something reliable can occur.”\n“And what is it you want from me?”\n“You already know.”\n“How to make the finest tanks, yes.” He shook his head, obviously unsure. The changes implied by her demands!\nOdrade wondered if she dared snap at him in open anger. How dense he was! But he was close to panic. Old values had changed. Honored Matres were not the only source of turmoil. Scytale did not even know the extent of changes that had infected his own Scattered Ones!\n“Times are changing,” Odrade said.\nChange, what a disturbing word, he thought.\n“I must have my own Face Dancer attendants! And my own tanks?” Almost begging.\n“My Council and | will consider it.”\n“What is there to consider?” Throwing her own words at her.\n“You need only your own approval. | require approval of others.” She gave him a grim smile. “So you do get time to\nthink.” Odrade nodded to Tamalane, who summoned guards.\n“Back to the no-ship?” He spoke from the doorway, such a diminutive figure amidst burly guards.\n“But tonight you ride all the way.”\nHe gave a last lingering stare at the worm as he left.\nWhen Scytale and guards were gone, Sheeana said: “You were right not to press him. He was ready to panic.”\nBellonda entered. “Perhaps it would be best just to kill him.”\n“Bell! Get the holo and go through our meeting again. This time as a Mentat!”\nThat stopped her.\nTamalane chuckled.\n“You take too much joy in your Sister’s discomfiture, Tam,” Sheeana said.\nTamalane shrugged but Odrade was delighted. No more teasing of Bell?\n“When you spoke of Chapterhouse becoming another Dune, that was when he began to panic,” Bellonda said, her voice Mentat distant.\nOdrade had seen the reaction but had not yet made the association. This was a Mentat’s value: patterns and systems, building blocks. Bell sensed a pattern to Scytale’s behavior.\n“I ask myself: Is it the thing become real once more?” Bellonda said.\nOdrade saw it at once. An odd thing about lost places. As long as Dune had been a known and living planet, there existed a historical firmness about its presence in the Galactic Register. You could point to a projection and say: “That is Dune. Once called Arrakis and, latterly, Rakis. Dune for its total desert character in Muad’Dib’s day.”\nDestroy the place, though, and a mythological patina in- weighed against projected reality. In time, such places became totally mythic. Arthur and his Round Table. Camelot\nwhere it only rains at night. Pretty good Weather Control for those days!\nBut now, a new Dune had appeared.\n“Myth power,” Tamalane said.\nAhhhh, yes. Tam, close to her final departure from flesh, would be more sensitive to workings of myths. Mystery and secrecy, tools of the Missionaria, had been used also on Dune by Muad’Dib and the Tyrant. The seeds were planted. Even with priests of the Divided God gone to their own perdition, myths of Dune proliferated.\n“Melange,” Tamalane said.\nThe other Sisters in the workroom knew immediately what she meant. New hope could be injected into the Bene Gesserit Scattering.\nBellonda said: “Why do they want us dead and not captives? That has always puzzled me.”\nHonored Matres might not want any Bene Gesserit alive... only the spice knowledge, perhaps. But they destroyed Dune. They destroyed the Tleilaxu. It was a cautioning thought to take into any confrontation with the Spider Queen—should Dortujla succeed.\n“No useful hostages?” Bellonda asked.\nOdrade saw the looks on the faces of her Sisters. They were following a single track as though all of them thought with one mind. Object lessons by Honored Matres, leaving few survivors, only made potential opposition more cautious. It invoked a rule of silence within which bitter memories became bitter myths. Honored Matres were like barbarians in any age: blood instead of hostages. Strike with random viciousness.\n“Dar’s right,” Tamalane said. “We've been seeking allies too close to home.”\n“Futars did not create themselves,” Sheeana said.\n“The ones who created them hope to control us,” Bellonda said. There was the clear sound of Prime Projection\nin her voice. “That’s the hesitation Dortujla heard in the Handlers.”\nThere it was and they faced it\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_066959f3481144c3af998c0a6fc106e0883cac1f8d48fe1fa52640f4ecd44155_v2"}
