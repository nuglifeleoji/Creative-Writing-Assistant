Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: “Many people have sought to change Arrakis.”\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served, my Lord.”\nThe Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.\n“The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,” she said, and smiled: “Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?”\nHe spoke coldly: “That seems a goodly custom. We Shall let it stand for now.”\nThe illusion that | suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?\nJessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. /s it\nbecause | moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.\nLeto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: “Sire! | forbid it!”\nA grim smile touched the Duke’s mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head. “I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,” he’d said. “Things move too swiftly on Arrakis. That’s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.”\nPaul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.\n“Her father manufactures stillsuits,” Jessica said. “I'm told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man’s suits.”\n“Who’s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?” the Duke asked. “I don’t place him.”\n“A late addition to the list,” she whispered. “Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.”\n“Gurney arranged?”\n“At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler’s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He’s a\npower among his kind. They all know him here. He’s dined at many of the houses.”\n“Why is he here?”\n“Everyone here will ask that question,” she said. “Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He'll also serve notice that you’re prepared to back up your orders against graft—by enforcement from the smugglers’ end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.”\n“l'm not sure / like it.” He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. “Why didn’t you invite some Fremen?”\n“There’s Kynes,” she said.\n“Yes, there’s Kynes,” he said. “Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?” He led her into step behind the procession.\n“All else is most conventional,” she said.\nAnd she thought: My darling, can’t you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.\nAs they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.\nUneasy silence settled over the room.\nJessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto’s mouth,\nnoted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.\n“Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,” Leto said. “This is my way of telling you that many things will change.”\nEmbarrassed silence settled over the table.\nThey think him drunk, Jessica thought.\nLeto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot beams of reflection off it. “As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,” he said, “I give you a toast.”\nThe others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a Ssuspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke’s hawk features.\n“Here I am and here | remain!” he barked.\nThere was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths—stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. “My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: ‘Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!’”\nHe sipped his water.\nThe others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.\n“Gurney!” the Duke called.\nFrom an alcove at Leto’s end of the room came Halleck’s voice. “Here, my Lord.”\n“Give us a tune, Gurney.”\nA minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the\ntable at the Duke’s gesture releasing them—roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-ole served with sparkling Caladan wine.\nStill, the Duke remained standing.\nAs the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: “In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.” His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. “I cannot sing, but | give you the words of Gurney’s song. Consider it another toast—a toast to all who’ve died bringing us to this station.”\nAn uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.\nJessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her—there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle- faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuek, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.\n“Review, friends—troops long past review,” the Duke intoned. “All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review, friends—troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends—troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we’ll pass the lure of fortune.”\nThe Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, Slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen.\nThe others drank in embarrassed silence.\nAgain, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.\nJessica was first to follow his example.\nThere was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests’ actions revealed—especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions, nervous laughter...and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.\nKynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetologist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.\nHalleck’s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.\n“Let the dinner commence,” the Duke said, and sank into his chair.\nHe’s angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.\nSlowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way. The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.\n“We brought both from Caladan,” she said. “Superb!” he said, tasting the chukka. “Simply superb! And not a hint of melange in it. One gets so\ntired of the spice in everything.”\nThe Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. “I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.”\n“News travels fast,” the Duke said.\n“Then it’s true?” the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.\n“Of course, it’s true!” the Duke snapped. “The blasted carryall disappeared. It shouldn’t be possible for anything that big to disappear!”\n“When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,” Kynes said.\n“It should not be possible!” the Duke repeated.\n“No one saw the carryall leave?” the banker asked.\n“Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,” Kynes said. “They’re primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall’s complement usually is four\nmen—two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one—or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke’s foes—”\n“Ah-h-h, | see,” the banker said. “And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?”\n“I shall have to consider my position carefully,” Kynes said, “and | certainly will not discuss it at table.” And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this ts the kind of infraction | was instructed to ignore.\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy- faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f3ebebf48ac1ad01362b6402162332442ebbf5cecbb14667a307d5fea60ee9a2_v2"}
