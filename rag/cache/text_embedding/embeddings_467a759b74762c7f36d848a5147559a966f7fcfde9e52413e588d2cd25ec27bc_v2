rocks above her, beckoning for speed. She quickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon.\nThe figure above was not one of her own escort. Otheym? she wondered, marking a familiarity of movement and manner. She came up to him, recognized in the growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing out on the desert for only a moment.\n“Hurry,” he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden cave. “It will be light soon,” he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her. “The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region. We dare not chance discovery now.”\nThey emerged into the narrow side-passage entrance to the Cave of Birds. Glowglobes came alight. Otheym pressed past her, said: “Follow me. Quickly, now.”\nThey sped down the passage, through another valve door, another passage and through hangings into what had been the Sayyadina’s alcove in the days when this was an overday rest cave. Rugs and cushions now covered the floor. Woven hangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls. A low field desk at one side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice origin.\nThe Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance. She looked up with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.\nOtheym pressed palms together, said: “I have brought Chani.” He bowed, retreated through the hangings.\nAnd Jessica thought: How do I tell Chani?\n“How is my grandson?” Jessica asked.\nSo it’s to be the ritual greeting, Chani thought, and her fears returned. Where is Muad’Dib? Why isn’t he here to greet me?\n“He is healthy and happy, my mother,” Chani said. “I left him with Alia in the care of Harah.”\nMy mother, Jessica thought. Yes, she has the right to call me that in the formal greeting. She has given me a grandson.\n“| hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch,” Jessica said.\n“It is lovely cloth,” Chani said.\n“Does Alia send a message?”\n“No message. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are beginning to accept the miracle of her status.”\nWhy does she drag this out so? Chani wondered. Something was so urgent that they sent a ‘thopter for me. Now, we drag through the formalities!\n“We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto,” Jessica said.\n“Whatever you wish, my mother,” Chani said. She lowered her gaze. “Is there news of battles?” She held her face expressionless that Jessica might not see the betrayal—that this was a question about Paul-Muad’Dib.\n“New victories,” Jessica said. “Rabban has sent cautious overtures about a truce. His messengers have been returned without their water. Rabban has even lightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages. But he is too late. The people know he does it out of fear of us.”\n“Thus it goes as Muad’Dib said,” Chani said. She Stared at Jessica, trying to keep her fears to herself. / have spoken his name, but she has not responded. One cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face...but she is too frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?\n“I wish we were in the south,” Jessica said. “The oases were so beautiful when we left. Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?”\n“The land is beautiful, true,” Chani said. “But there is much grief in it.”\n“Grief is the price of victory,” Jessica said.\nIs she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herself. She said: “There are so many women without men.\nThere was jealousy when it was learned that I’d been Summoned north.”\n“I Summoned you,” Jessica said.\nChani felt her heart hammering. She wanted to clap her hands to her ears, fearful of what they might hear. Still, she kept her voice even: “The message was signed Muad'’Dib.”\n“I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants,” Jessica said. “It was a subterfuge of necessity.” And Jessica thought: This is a brave woman, my Paul’s. She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her. Yes. She may be the one we need now.\nOnly the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chani’s voice as she said: “Now you may say the thing that must be said.”\n“You were needed here to help me revive Paul,” Jessica said. And she thought: There! I said it in the precisely correct way. Revive. Thus she knows Paul ts alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.\nChani took only a moment to calm herself, then: “What is it | may do?” She wanted to leap at Jessica, Shake her and scream: “Take me to him!” But she waited silently for the answer.\n“I suspect,” Jessica said, “that the Harkonnens have managed to send an agent among us to poison Paul. It’s the only explanation that seems to fit. A most unusual poison. I’ve examined his blood in the most subtle ways without detecting it.”\nChani thrust herself forward onto her knees. “Poison? Is he in pain? Could l....”\n“He is unconscious,” Jessica said. “The processes of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. | shudder to think what could have happened had | not been the one to discover him. He appears dead to the untrained eye.”\n“You have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me,” Chani said. “I know you, Reverend Mother. What is it you think | may do that you cannot do?”\nShe is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive, Jessica thought. She’d have made a fine Bene Gesserit.\n“Chani,” Jessica said, “you may find this difficult to believe, but | do not know precisely why | sent for you. It was an instinct...a basic intuition. The thought came unbidden: ‘Send for Chani.’”\nFor the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica’s expression, the unveiled pain modifying the inward stare.\n“I’ve done all I know to do,” Jessica said. “That all...it is so far beyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty imagining it. Yet...| failed.”\n“The old companion, Halleck,” Chani asked, “is it possible he’s a traitor?”\n“Not Gurney,” Jessica said.\nThe two words carried an entire conversation, and Chani saw the searching, the tests...the memories of old failures that went into this flat denial.\nChani rocked back onto her feet, stood up, smoothed her desert-stained robe. “Take me to him,” she said.\nJessica arose, turned through hangings on the left wall.\nChani followed, found herself in what had been a storeroom, its rock walls concealed now beneath heavy draperies. Paul lay on a field pad against the far wall. A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face. A black robe covered him to the chest, leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides. He appeared to be unclothed under the robe. The skin exposed looked waxen, rigid. There was no visible movement to him.\nChani suppressed the desire to dash forward, throw herself across him. She found her thoughts, instead, going to her son—Leto. And she realized in this instant that Jessica once had faced such a moment—her man threatened by death, forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young son. The realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani reached out and clasped Jessica’s hand. The answering grip was painful in its intensity.\n“He lives,” Jessica said. “I assure you he lives. But the thread of his life is so thin it could easily escape detection. There are some among the leaders already muttering that the mother speaks and not the Reverend Mother, that my son is truly dead and | do not want to give up his water to the tribe.”\n“How long has he been this way?” Chani asked. She disengaged her hand from Jessica’s, moved farther into the room.\n“Three weeks,” Jessica said. “I spent almost a week trying to revive him. There were meetings,\narguments...investigations. Then | sent for you. The Fedaykin obey my orders, else | might not have been able to delay the....” She wet her lips with her tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul.\nChani stood over him now, looking down on the soft beard of youth that framed his face, tracing with her eyes the high browline, the strong nose, the shuttered eyes—the features so peaceful in this rigid repose.\n“How does he take nourishment?” Chani asked.\n“The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food,” Jessica said.\n“How many know of what has happened?” Chani asked.\n“Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of course, whoever administered the poison.”\n“There is no clue to the poisoner?”\n“And it’s not for want of investigating,” Jessica said.\n“What do the Fedaykin say?” Chani asked.\n“They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers before the final battles. This is a thought I’ve cultivated.”\nChani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad, bent close to Paul’s face. She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face...but it was only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in Fremen life. Still....\n“You were not born to the spice as we were,” Chani said. “Have you investigated the possibility\nthat his body has rebelled against too much spice in his diet?”\n“Allergy reactions are all negative,” Jessica said.\nShe closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden realization of fatigue. How long have I been without sleep? she asked herself. Too long.\n“When you change the Water of Life,” Chani said, “you do it within yourself by the inward awareness. Have you used this awareness to test his blood?”\n“Normal Fremen blood,” Jessica said. “Completely adapted to the diet and the life here.”\nChani sat back on her heels, submerging her fears in thought as she studied Paul’s face. This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend Mothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire attention.\nPresently, Chani said: “Is there a maker here?”\n“There are several,” Jessica said with a touch of weariness. “We are never without them these days. Each victory requires its blessing. Each ceremony before a raid—”\n“But Paul-Muad’Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies,” Chani said.\nJessica nodded to herself, remembering her son’s ambivalent feelings toward the spice drug and the prescient awareness it precipitated.\n“How did you know this?” Jessica asked.\n“It is spoken.”\n“Too much is spoken,” Jessica said bitterly.\n“Get me the raw Water of the maker,” Chani said.\nJessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani’s voice, then observed the intense concentration in the younger woman and said: “At once.” She went out through", " Paul’s face. This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend Mothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire attention.\nPresently, Chani said: “Is there a maker here?”\n“There are several,” Jessica said with a touch of weariness. “We are never without them these days.

And it’s the sort of thing he might try....\nJessica knelt beside Chani, holding out a plain camp ewer. The charged odor of the poison was sharp in Chani’s nostrils. She dipped a finger in the fluid, held the finger close to Paul’s nose.\nThe skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled Slightly. Slowly, the nostrils flared.\nJessica gasped.\nChani touched the dampened finger to Paul’s upper lip.\nHe drew in a long, sobbing breath.\n“What is this?” Jessica demanded.\n“Be still,” Chani said. “You must convert a small amount of the sacred water. Quickly!”\nWithout questioning, because she recognized the tone of awareness in Chani’s voice, Jessica lifted the ewer to her mouth, drew in a small sip.\nPaul’s eyes flew open. He stared upward at Chani.\n“It is not necessary for her to change the Water,” he said. His voice was weak, but steady.\nJessica, a sip of the fluid on her tongue, found her body rallying, converting the poison almost automatically. In the light elevation the ceremony always imparted, she sensed the life-glow from Paul— a radiation there registering on her senses.\nIn that instant, she knew.\n“You drank the sacred water!” she blurted.\n“One drop of it,” Paul said. “So small...one drop.”\n“How could you do such a foolish thing?” she demanded.\n“He is your son,” Chani said.\nJessica glared at her.\nA rare smile, warm and full of understanding, touched Paul’s lips. “Hear my beloved,” he said. “Listen to her, Mother. She knows.”\n“A thing that others can do, he must do,” Chani said.\n“When I had the drop in my mouth, when I felt it and smelled it, when I knew what it was doing to me, then I knew I could do the thing that you have done,” he said. “Your Bene Gesserit proctors speak of the Kwisatz Haderach, but they cannot begin to guess the many places | have been. In the few minutes I....” He broke off, looking at Chani with a puzzled frown. “Chani? How did you get here? You’re supposed to be.... Why are you here?”\nHe tried to push himself onto his elbows. Chani pressed him back gently.\n“Please, my Usul,” she said.\n“I feel so weak,” he said. His gaze darted around the room. “How long have | been here?”\n“You’ve been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed to have fled,” Jessica said.\n“But it was.... | took it just a moment ago and....”\n“A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me,” Jessica said.\n“It was only one drop, but | converted it,” Paul said. “I changed the Water of Life.” And before Chani\nor Jessica could stop him, he dipped his hand into the ewer they had placed on the floor beside him, and he brought the dripping hand to his mouth, swallowed the palm-cupped liquid.\n“Paul!” Jessica screamed.\nHe grabbed her hand, faced her with a death’s head grin, and he sent his awareness surging over her.\nThe rapport was not as tender, not as sharing, not as encompassing as it had been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern...but it was a rapport: a sense-sharing of the entire being. It shook her, weakened her, and she cowered in her mind, fearful of him.\nAloud, he said: “You speak of a place where you cannot enter? This place which the Reverend Mother cannot face, show it to me.”\nShe shook her head, terrified by the very thought.\n“Show it to me!” he commanded.\n“No!”\nBut she could not escape him. Bludgeoned by the terrible force of him, she closed her eyes and focused inward—the-direction-that-is-dark.\nPaul’s consciousness flowed through and around her and into the darkness. She glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself away from the terror. Without knowing why, her whole being trembled at what she had seen—a region where a wind blew and sparks glared, where rings of light expanded and contracted, where rows of tumescent white shapes flowed over and under and around the lights, driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere.\nPresently, she opened her eyes, saw Paul staring up at her. He still held her hand, but the terrible rapport was gone. She quieted her trembling. Paul released her hand. It was as though some crutch had been removed. She staggered up and back, would have fallen had not Chani jumped to support her.\n“Reverend Mother!” Chani said. “What is wrong?”\n“Tired,” Jessica whispered. “So...tired.”\n“Here,” Chani said. “Sit here.” She helped Jessica to a cushion against the wall.\nThe strong young arms felt so good to Jessica. She clung to Chani.\n“He has, in truth, seen the Water of Life?” Chani asked. She disengaged herself from Jessica’s grip.\n“He has seen,” Jessica whispered. Her mind still rolled and surged from the contact. It was like stepping to solid land after weeks on a heaving sea. She sensed the old Reverend Mother within her...and all the others awakened and questioning: “What was that? What happened? Where was that place?”\nThrough it all threaded the realization that her son was the Kwisatz Haderach, the one who could be many places at once. He was the fact out of the Bene Gesserit dream. And the fact gave her no peace.\n“What happened?” Chani demanded.\nJessica shook her head.\nPaul said: “There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without\nchanging into something other than man. Fora woman, the situation is reversed.”\nJessica looked up, found Chani was staring at her while listening to Paul.\n“Do you understand me, Mother?” Paul asked.\nShe could only nod.\n“These things are so ancient within us,” Paul said, “that they’re ground into each separate cell of our bodies. We’re shaped by such forces. You can say to yourself, ‘Yes, | see how such a thing may be.’ But when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives. It’s as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking.”\n“And you, my son,” Jessica asked, “are you one who gives or one who takes?”\n“I'm at the fulcrum,” he said. “I cannot give without taking and | cannot take without....” He broke off, looking to the wall at his right.\nChani felt a draft against her cheek, turned to see the hangings close.\n“It was Otheym,” Paul said. “He was listening.”\nAccepting the words, Chani was touched by some of the prescience that haunted Paul, and she knew a thing-yet-to-be as though it already had occurred. Otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard. Others would spread the story until it was a fire over the land. Paul-Muad’Dib is not as other men, they would say. There can be no more doubt. He is a man,\nyet he sees through to the Water of Life in the way of a Reverend Mother. He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib.\n“You have seen the future, Paul,” Jessica said. “Will you say what you've seen?”\n“Not the future,” he said. “I’ve seen the Now.” He forced himself to a sitting position, waved Chani aside as she moved to help him. “The Space above Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild.”\nJessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.\n“The Padishah Emperor himself is there,” Paul said. He looked at the rock ceiling of his cell. “With his favorite Truthsayer and five legions of Sardaukar. The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with Thufir Hawat beside him and seven ships jammed with every conscript he could muster. Every Great House has its raiders above us...waiting.”\nChani shook her head, unable to look away from Paul. His strangeness, the flat tone of voice, the way he looked through her, filled her with awe.\nJessica tried to swallow in a dry throat, said: “For what are they waiting?”\nPaul looked at her. “For the Guild’s permission to land. The Guild will strand on Arrakis any force that lands without permission.”\n“The Guild’s protecting us?” Jessica asked.\n“Protecting us! The Guild itself caused this by Spreading tales about what we do here and by reducing troop transport fares to a point where even the poorest Houses are up there now waiting to loot us.”\nJessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone, wondered at it. She couldn’t doubt his words—they\nhad that same intensity she’d seen in him the night he’d revealed the path of the future that’d taken them among the Fremen.\nPaul took a deep breath, said: “Mother, you must change a quantity of the Water for us. We need the catalyst. Chani, have a scout force sent out...to find a pre-spice mass. If we plant a quantity of the Water of Life above a pre-spice mass, do you know what will happen?”\nJessica weighed his words, suddenly saw through to his meaning. “Paul!” she gasped.\n“The Water of Death,” he said. “It’d be a chain reaction.” He pointed to the floor. “Spreading death among the little makers, killing a vector of the life cycle that includes the spice and the makers. Arrakis will become a true desolation—without spice or maker.”\nChani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy pouring from Paul’s lips.\n“He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it,” Paul said. “We can destroy the spice.”\n“What stays the Guild’s hand?” Jessica whispered. “They’re searching for me,” Paul said. “Think of that! The finest Guild navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for the\nfastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me...and unable to find me. How they tremble! They know | have their secret here!” Paul held out his cupped hand. “Without the spice they’re blind!”\n", " Water of Death,” he said. “It’d be a chain reaction.” He pointed to the floor. “Spreading death among the little makers, killing a vector of the life cycle that includes the spice and the makers. Arrakis will become a true desolation—without spice or maker.”\nChani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy pouring from Paul’s lips.\n“He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it,” Paul said. “We can destroy the spice.”\n“What stays the Guild’s hand?” Jessica whispered. “They’re searching for me,” Paul said. “Think of that! The finest Guild navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for the\nfastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me...and unable to find me. How they tremble! They know | have their secret here!” Paul held out his cupped hand. “Without the spice they’re blind!”\nChani found her voice. “You said you see the now!”\nPaul lay back, searching the spread-out present, its limits extended into the future and into the past, holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the spice illumination began to fade.\n“Go do as | commanded,” he said. “The future’s becoming as muddled for the Guild as it is for me. The lines of vision are narrowing. Everything focuses here where the spice is...where they’ve dared not interfere before...because to interfere was to lose what they must have. But now they’re desperate. All paths lead into darkness.”\nAnd that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel poised to spin.\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad W ill you look at that thing!” Stilgar whispered.\nPaul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim, eye fixed to the collector of a Fremen telescope. The oil lens was focused on a starship lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow side still showed yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night. Beyond the ship, the city of Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun.\nIt wasn’t the lighter that excited Stilgar’s awe, Paul knew, but the construction for which the lighter was only the centerpost. A single metal hutment, many Stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle from the base of the lighter—a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves—the temporary lodging place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial Majesty, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\nFrom his position squatting at Paul’s left, Gurney Halleck said: “I count nine levels to it. Must be quite a few Sardaukar in there.”\n“Five legions,” Paul said.\n“It grows light,” Stilgar hissed. “We like it not, your exposing yourself, Muad’Dib. Let us go back into the\nrocks now.”\n“I’m perfectly safe here,” Paul said.\n“That ship mounts projectile weapons,” Gurney said.\n“They believe us protected by shields,” Paul said. “They wouldn’t waste a shot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us.”\nPaul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin, seeing the pockmarked cliffs, the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his father’s troopers. And he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things that the shades of those men should look down on this moment. The Harkonnen forts and towns across the shielded lands lay in Fremen hands or cut away from their source like stalks severed from a plant and left to wither. Only this basin and its city remained to the enemy.\n“They might try a sortie by ‘thopter,” Stilgar said. “If they see us.”\n“Let them,” Paul said. “We’ve 'thopters to burn today...and we know a storm is coming.”\nHe swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field now, to the Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company banner waving gently from its staff on the ground beneath them. And he thought of the desperation that had forced the Guild to permit these two groups to land while all the others were held in reserve. The Guild was like a man testing the sand with his toe to gauge its temperature before erecting a tent.\n“Is there anything new to see from here?” Gurney asked. “We should be getting under cover. The storm\nis coming.”\nPaul returned his attention on the giant hutment. “They've even brought their women,” he said. “And lackeys and servants. Ah-h-h, my dear Emperor, how confident you are.”\n“Men are coming up the secret way,” Stilgar said. “It may be Otheym and Korba returning.”\n“All right, Stil,” Paul said. “We'll go back.”\nBut he took one final look around through the telescope—studying the plain with its tall ships, the gleaming metal hutment, the silent city, the frigates of the Harkonnen mercenaries. Then he slid backward around a scarp of rock. His place at the telescope was taken by a Fedaykin guardsman.\nPaul emerged into a shallow depression in the Shield Wall’s surface. It was a place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep, a natural feature of the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a translucent camouflage cover. Communications equipment was clustered around a hole in the wall to the right. Fedaykin guards deployed through the depression waited for Muad’Dib’s command to attack.\nTwo men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment, spoke to the guards there.\nPaul glanced at Stilgar, nodded in the direction of the two men. “Get their report, Stil.”\nStilgar moved to obey.\nPaul crouched with his back to the rock, stretching his muscles, straightened. He saw Stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the rock, thought\nabout the long climb down that narrow man-made tunnel to the floor of the basin.\nStilgar crossed to Paul.\n“What was so important that they couldn’t send a cielago with the message?” Paul asked.\n“They’re saving their birds for the battle,” Stilgar said. He glanced at the communications equipment, back to Paul. “Even with a tight beam, it is wrong to use those things, Muad’Dib. They can find you by taking a bearing on its emission.”\n“They'll soon be too busy to find me,” Paul said. “What did the men report?”\n“Our pet Sardaukar have been released near Old Gap low on the rim and are on their way to their master. The rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are in place. The people are deployed as you ordered. It was all routine.”\nPaul glanced across the shallow bowl, studying his men in the filtered light admitted by the camouflage cover. He felt time creeping like an insect working its way across an exposed rock.\n“It'll take our Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop carrier,” Paul said. “They are being watched?”\n“They are being watched,” Stilgar said.\nBeside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. “Hadn't we best be getting to a place of safety?”\n“There is no such place,” Paul said. “Is the weather report still favorable?”\n“A great grandmother of a storm coming,” Stilgar said. “Can you not feel it, Muad’Dib?”\n“The air does feel chancy,” Paul agreed. “But | like the certainty of poling the weather.”\n“The storm’Il be here in the hour,” Stilgar said. He nodded toward the gap that looked out on the Emperor’s hutment and the Harkonnen frigates. “They know it there, too. Not a ‘thopter in the sky. Everything pulled in and tied down. They’ve had a report on the weather from their friends in space.”\n“Any more probing sorties?” Paul asked.\n“Nothing since the landing last night,” Stilgar said. “They know we're here. | think now they wait to choose their own time.”\n“We choose the time,” Paul said.\nGurney glanced upward, growled: “If they let us.”\n“That fleet’ll stay in space,” Paul said.\nGurney shook his head.\n“They have no choice,” Paul said. “We can destroy the spice. The Guild dares not risk that.”\n“Desperate people are the most dangerous,” Gurney said.\n“Are we not desperate?” Stilgar asked.\nGurney scowled at him.\n“You haven't lived with the Fremen dream,” Paul cautioned. “Stil is thinking of all the water we’ve spent on bribes, the years of waiting we’ve added before Arrakis can bloom. He’s not—”\n“Arrrgh,” Gurney scowled.\n“Why’s he so gloomy?” Stilgar asked.\n“He’s always gloomy before a battle,” Paul said. “It’s the only form of good humor Gurney allows himself.”\nA slow, wolfish grin spread across Gurney’s face, the teeth showing white above the chip cut of his stillsuit. “It glooms me much to think on all the poor Harkonnen souls we'll dispatch unshriven,” he said.\nStilgar chuckled. “He talks like a Fedaykin.”\n“Gurney was born a death commando,” Paul said. And he thought: Yes, /et them occupy their minds with small talk before we test ourselves against that force on the plain. He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney, found that the troubadour- warrior had resumed a brooding scowl.\n“Worry saps the strength,” Paul murmured. “You told me that once, Gurney.”\n“My Duke,” Gurney said, “my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them to blast a hole in the Shield Wall...”\n“Those people up there won’t use atomics against us,” Paul said. “They don’t dare...and for the same reason that they cannot risk our destroying the source of the spice.”\n“But the injunction against—”\n“The injunction!” Paul barked. “It’s fear, not the injunction that keeps the Houses from hurling atomics against each other. The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: ‘Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration.’ We’re going to blast the Shield Wall, not humans.”\n“It’s too fine a point,” Gurney said.\n“The hair-splitters up there will welcome any point,” Paul said. “Let’s talk no more about it.”\nHe turned away, wishing he actually felt that confident. Presently, he said: “What about the city people? Are they in position yet?”\n“Yes,” Stilgar muttered.\nPaul looked at him. “What’s eating you?”\n“I never knew the city man could be trusted completely,” Stilgar said.\n“I was a city man myself once,” Paul said.\nStilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. “Muad’Dib knows | did not mean—”\n“I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn’t what you think he'll do. It’s what he actually does. These city people have Fremen blood. It’s just that they haven’t yet learned how to escape their bondage. We'll teach them.”\nStilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: “The habits of a lifetime, Muad’Dib. On the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the communities.”\nPaul"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_467a759b74762c7f36d848a5147559a966f7fcfde9e52413e588d2cd25ec27bc_v2"}
