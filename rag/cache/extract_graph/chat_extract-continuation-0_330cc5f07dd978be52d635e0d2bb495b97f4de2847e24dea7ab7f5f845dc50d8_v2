Removing the barriers. When all else palled, there was still her tangled childhood.\nThere had been a time when Odrade lived as most children lived: in a house with a man and woman who, if not her parents, certainly acted in loco parentis. All of the other children she knew then lived in similar situations. They had\npapas and mamas. Sometimes only papa worked away from home. Sometimes only mama went out to her labors. In Odrade’s case, the woman remained at home and no crèche nurse guarded the child in the working hours. Much later, Odrade learned that her birth-mother had given a large sum of money to provide this for the infant female hidden in plain sight that way.\n“She hid you with us because she loved you,” the woman explained when Odrade was old enough to understand. “That is why you must never reveal that we are not your real parents.”\nLove had nothing to do with it, Odrade learned later. Reverend Mothers did not act from such mundane motives. And Odrade’s birth-mother had been a Bene Gesserit Sister.\nAll of this was revealed to Odrade according to the Original plan. Her name: Odrade. Darwi was what she had always been called when the caller was not being endearing or angry. Young friends naturally shortened it to Dar.\nEverything, however, did not go according to the original plan. Odrade recalled a narrow bed in a room brightened by paintings of animals and fantasy landscapes on the pastel blue walls. White curtains fluttered at the window in the soft breezes of spring and summer. Odrade remembered jumping on the narrow bed—a marvelously happy game: up, down, up, down. Much laughter. Arms caught her in mid leap and hugged her close. They were a man’s arms: a round face with a small mustache that tickled her into giggles. The bed thumped the wall when she jumped and the wall revealed indentations from this movement.\nOdrade played over this memory now, reluctant to discard it into the well of rationality. Marks on a wall. Marks of laughter and joy. How small they were to represent so much.\nOdd how she had been thinking more and more about papa recently. All of the memories were not happy. There had been times when he had been sad-angry, warning\nmama not to become “too involved.” He had a face that reflected many frustrations. His voice barked when he was in his angry mood. Mama moved softly then, her eyes full of worry. Odrade sensed the worry and the fear and resented the man. The woman knew best how to deal with him. She kissed the nape of his neck, stroked his cheek and whispered into his ear.\nThese ancient “natural” emotions had engaged a Bene Gesserit analyst-proctor in much work with Odrade before they were exorcised. But even now there was residual detritus to pick up and discard. Even now, Odrade knew that all of it was not gone.\nSeeing the way Taraza studied the biographical record with such care, Odrade wondered if that was the flaw the Mother Superior saw.\nSurely they know by now that I can deal with the emotions of those early times.\nIt was all so long ago. Still, she had to admit that the memory of the man and woman lay within her, bonded with such force that it might never be erased completely. Especially mama.\nThe Reverend Mother in extremis who had borne Odrade had put her in that hiding place on Gammu for reasons Odrade now understood quite well. Odrade harbored no resentments. It had been necessary for the survival of them both. Problems arose from the fact that the foster mother gave Odrade that thing which most mothers give their children, that thing which the Sisterhood so distrusted— love.\nWhen the Reverend Mothers came, the foster mother had not fought the removal of her child. Two Reverend Mothers came with a contingent of male and female proctors. Afterward Odrade was a long time understanding the significance of that wrenching moment. The woman had known in her heart that the day of parting would come. Only\na matter of time. Still, as the days became years—almost six standards of years—the woman had dared to hope.\nThen the Reverend Mothers came with their burly attendants. They had merely been waiting until it was safe, until they were sure no hunters knew this was a Bene Gesserit-planned Atreides scion.\nOdrade saw a great deal of money passed to the foster mother. The woman threw the money on the floor. But no voice was raised in objection. The adults in the scene knew where the power lay.\nCalling up those compressed emotions, Odrade could still see the woman take herself to a straight-backed chair beside the window onto the street, there to hug herself and rock back and forth, back and forth. Not a sound from her.\nThe Reverend Mothers used Voice and their considerable wiles plus the smoke of drugging herbs and their overpowering presence to lure Odrade into their waiting groundcar.\n“It will be just for a little while. Your real mother sent us.”\nOdrade sensed the lies but curiosity compelled. My real mother!\nHer last view of the woman who had been her only known female parent was of that figure at the window rocking back and forth, a look of misery on her face, arms wrapped around herself.\nLater, when Odrade spoke of returning to the woman, that memory-vision was incorporated into an essential Bene Gesserit lesson.\n“Love leads to misery. Love is a very ancient force, which served its purpose in its day but no longer is essential for the survival of the species. Remember that woman’s mistake, the pain.”\nUntil well into her teens, Odrade adjusted by daydreaming. She would rea//y return after she was a full Reverend Mother. She would go back and find that loving woman, find her even though she had no names except\n“mama” and “Sibia.” Odrade recalled the laughter of adult friends who had called the woman “Sibia.”\nMama Sibia.\nThe Sisters, however, detected the daydreams and searched out their source. That, too, was incorporated into a lesson.\n“Daydreaming is the first awakening of what we call simulflow. It is an essential tool of rational thought. With it you can clear the mind for better thinking.”\nSimulflow.\nOdrade focused on Taraza at the morning room table. Childhood trauma must be placed carefully into a reconstructed memory-place. All of that had been far away on Gammu, the planet that the people of Dan had rebuilt after the Famine Times and the Scattering. The people of Dan—Caladan in those days. Odrade took a firm grip on rational thought, using the stance of the Other Memories that had flooded into her awareness during the spice agony when she had really become a full Reverend Mother.\nSimulflow . . . the filter of consciousness ... Other Memories.\nWhat powerful tools the Sisterhood had given her. What dangerous tools. All of those other lives lay there just beyond the curtain of awareness, tools of survival, not a way to satisfy casual curiosity.\nTaraza spoke, translating from the material that scrolled past her eyes: “You dig too much in your Other Memories. That drains away energies better conserved.”\nThe Mother Superior’s blue-in-blue eyes sent a piercing stare upward at Odrade. “You sometimes go right to the edge of fleshly tolerance. That can lead to your premature death.”\n“lam careful with the spice, Mother.”\n“And well you should be! A body can take only so much melange, only so much prowling in its past!”\n“Have you found my flaw?” Odrade asked.\n“Gammu!” One word but an entire harangue.\nOdrade knew. The unavoidable trauma of those lost years on Gammu. They were a distraction that had to be rooted out and made rationally acceptable.\n“But | am sent to Rakis,” Odrade said.\n“And see that you remember the aphorisms of moderation. Remember who you are!”\nOnce more, Taraza bent to her display.\nlam Odrade, Odrade thought.\nIn the Bene Gesserit schools where first names tended to Slip away, roll call was by last name. Friends and acquaintances picked up the habit of using the roll-call name. They learned early that sharing secret or private names was an ancient device for ensnaring a person in affections.\nTaraza, three classes ahead of Odrade, had been assigned to “bring the younger girl along,” a deliberate association by watchful teachers.\n“Bringing along” meant a certain amount of lording it over the younger but also incorporated essentials better taught by someone closer to peer relationship. Taraza, with access to the private records of her trainee, started calling the younger girl “Dar.” Odrade responded by calling Taraza “Tar.” The two names acquired a certain glue—Dar and Tar. Even after Reverend Mothers overheard and reprimanded them, they occasionally lapsed into error if only for the amusement.\nOdrade, looking down at Taraza now, said: “Dar and Tar.”\nA smile twitched the edges of Taraza’s mouth.\n“What is it in my records that you don’t already know several times over?” Odrade asked.\nTaraza sat back and waited for the chairdog to adjust itself to the new position. She rested her clasped hands on the tabletop and looked up at the younger woman.\nNot much younger, really, Taraza thought.\nSince school, though, Taraza had thought of Odrade as completely removed into a younger age group, creating a gap no passage of years could close.\n“Care at the beginning, Dar,” Taraza said.\n“This project is well past its beginning,” Odrade said.\n“But your part in it starts now. And we are launching ourselves into such a beginning as has never before been attempted.”\n“Am | now to learn the entire design for this ghola?”\n“No.”\nThat was it. All the evidence of high-level dispute and the “need to know” cast away with a single word. But Odrade understood. There was an organizational rubric laid down by the original Bene Gesserit Chapter House, which had endured with only minor changes for millennia. Bene Gesserit divisions were cut by hard vertical and horizontal barriers, divided into isolated groups that converged to a single command only here at the top. Duties (for which read “assigned roles”) were conducted within separated cells. Active participants within a cell did not know their contemporaries within other parallel cells.\nBut I know that the Reverend Mother Lucilla is in a parallel cell, Odrade thought. /t’s the logical answer.\nShe recognized the necessity. It was an ancient design copied from secret revolutionary societies. The Bene Gesserit had always seen themselves as permanent revolutionaries. It was a revolution that had been dampened only in the time of the Tyrant, Leto Il.\nDampened, but not diverted or stopped, Odrade reminded herself.\n“In what you’re about to do,” Taraza said, “tell me if you sense any immediate threat to the Sisterhood.”\nIt was one of Taraza’s peculiar demands, which Odrade had learned to answer out of wordless instinct, which then could be formed into words. Quickly, she said: “If we fail to act, that is worse.”\n“We reasoned that there would be danger,” Taraza said. She spoke in a dry, remote voice. Taraza did not like calling up this talent in Odrade. The younger woman possessed a prescient instinct for detecting threats to the Sisterhood. It came from the wild influence in her genetic line, of course— the Atreides with their dangerous talents.
