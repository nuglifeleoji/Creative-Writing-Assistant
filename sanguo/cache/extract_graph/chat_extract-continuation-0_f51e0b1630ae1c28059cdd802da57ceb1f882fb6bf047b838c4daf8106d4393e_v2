间，忽尚书李福又至；见孔明昏绝，口不能言，乃大哭曰：“我误国家之大事也！”须臾，孔明复醒，开目遍视，见李福立于榻前。孔明曰：“吾已知公复来之意。福谢曰：“福奉天子命，问丞相百年后，谁可任大事者。适因匆遽，失于谘请，故复来耳。”孔明曰：“吾死之后，可任大事者：蒋公琰其宜也。”福曰：“公琰之后，谁可继之？”孔明曰：“费文伟可继之。”福又问：“文伟之后，谁当继者？”孔明不答。众将近前视之，已薨矣。时建兴十二年秋八月二十三日也，寿五十四岁。后杜工部有诗叹曰：“长星昨夜坠前营，讣报先生此日倾。虎帐不闻施号令，麟台惟显著勋名。空余门下三千客，辜负胸中十万兵。好看绿阴清昼里，于今无复雅歌声！”白乐天亦有诗曰：“先生晦迹卧山林，三顾那逢圣主寻。鱼到南阳方得水，龙飞天汉便为霖。托孤既尽殷勤礼，报国还倾忠义心。前后出师遗表在，令人一览泪沾襟。”初，蜀长水校尉廖立，自谓才名宜为孔明之副，尝以职位闲散，怏怏不平，怨谤无已。于是孔明废之为庶人，徒之汶山。及闻孔明亡，乃垂泣曰：“吾终为左衽矣！”李严闻之，亦大哭病死，盖严尝望孔明复收己，得自补前过；度孔明死后，人不能用之故也。后元微之有赞孔明诗曰：“拨乱扶危主，殷勤受托孤。英才过管乐，妙策胜孙吴。凛凛《出师表》，堂堂八阵图。如公全盛德，应叹古今无！”\n\n    是夜，天愁地惨，月色无光，孔明奄然归天。姜维、杨仪遵孔明遗命，不敢举哀，依法成殓，安置龛中，令心腹将卒三百人守护；随传密令，使魏延断后，各处营寨一一退去。\n\n    却说司马懿夜观天文，见一大星，赤色，光芒有角，自东北方流于西南方，坠于蜀营内，三投再起，隐隐有声。懿惊喜曰：“孔明死矣！”即传令起大兵追之。方出寨门，忽又疑虑曰：“孔明善会六丁六甲之法，今见我久不出战，故以此术诈死，诱我出耳。今若追之，必中其计。”遂复勒马回寨不出，只令夏侯霸暗引数十骑，往五丈原山僻哨探消息。\n\n    却说魏延在本寨中，夜作一梦，梦见头上忽生二角，醒来甚是疑异。次日，行军司马赵直至，延请入问曰：“久知足下深明《易》理，吾夜梦头生二角，不知主何吉凶？烦足下为我决之。”赵直想了�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LI
