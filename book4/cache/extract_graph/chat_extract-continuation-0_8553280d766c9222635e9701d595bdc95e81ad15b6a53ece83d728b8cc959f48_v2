\n　　只是老伴一直对这事不高兴。 \n　　不管高兴不高兴，既然这个女孩子要上门来，家里就得准备一下！ \n　　吴斌赶忙给省档案局工作的老伴打了电话——她在那里当个副局长，事也不太多。 \n　　老伴在中午下班前一个小时就回来了。 \n　　她安排保姆去准备晚上的饭菜后，就又和他嘟嘟开了：“农村人！哼，我们家将有个农村来的儿媳妇！” \n　　“农村人怎？我也是农村出身！”吴斌反驳道。“卫生习惯，智力……” \n　　“你连面也没见，就知道人家不讲卫生？至于智力，她考入那个大学就说明她肯定超过了管理档案的水平！”吴斌不由讥讽地对老伴说。 \n　　副局长不敢顶撞副书记，只好一边嘟嘟着，一边提前准备这顿她不乐意的晚餐去了。 \n　　午休起来，老伴继续在做接待客人的准备——她完全按他们家的最高规格来安排这次隆重的晚宴；这在很大程度上是为了让他们的宝贝儿子满意。 \n　　这时候，吴斌就坐在客厅里等待事先约好的两次谈话——一次是别人通过常务副秘书长张生民约的；一次是省纪监委书记苗凯直接和他约的。 \n　　客厅很大，象个小会议室；地上铺着本省黄原出产的地毯，围了一圈大沙发。墙上除过几幅古画外，还有现代书法家舒同写的一首唐诗；看来是书法家的真迹——在这个城市里，到处可以见到此公书写的胖乎乎的毛笔字。客人未到之前，吴斌先将一摞文件和材料拿到茶几上，戴起老花镜，手里握着红蓝铅笔，随时准备在文件和材料上用杠杠或三角形标出要点；看完一份后在自己的名字上画一个圆圈或打一个勾。当然，有时候他还得另换支钢笔，在材料或文件上写几句话——这几句话通常叫做“指示”，立刻就成了某件事权威性的处理意见。 \n　　第一批客人被保姆带进了会客室。 \n　　客人是省作家协会副主席黑白。黑白是名人，吴斌和他很熟悉，两个人见面先耍笑了几句。 \n　　黑老把一支主要用以显示风度的手杖立在墙角，然后给吴书记介绍了随他而来的另外两个年轻人。这两个人我们都已经熟悉了，一位是黄原文联副主席贾冰，一位是省作协《山丹丹》编辑部的现代派诗人古风铃。黑老除介绍了这两个人的职务外，还说明了他们都是全省知名的中青年诗人。 \n　　吴斌和两位诗人握了握手，就让客人们在沙发里入座。“咱们就直截了当说吧！什么事又让老将亲自出马？是不是作协又没钱花了\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>吴斌<|>PERSON<|>吴斌 is a character who is
