Walk to the edge of the stage and tell them what it meant: “Today,\nSisters, we learned that Honored Matres have obliterated four more of our planets. We are that much smaller.”\nOnly twelve planets (including Buzzell) and the faceless hunter with the axe is that much closer.\nOdrade felt the chasm yawning beneath her.\nBellonda had been ordered to contain this latest bad news until a more appropriate moment.\nOdrade looked out the window beside her. What was an appropriate moment for such news?\nThey had been driving south a little more than three hours, the burner-glazed roadway like a green river ahead of them. This passage led them through hillsides of cork oaks that stretched out to ridge-enclosed horizons. The oaks had been allowed to grow gnomelike in less regimented plantations than orchards. There were meandering rows up the hills. The original plantation had been laid out on existing contours, semiterraces now obscured by long brown grass.\n“We grow truffles in there,” Odrade said.\nStreggi had more bad news. “I am told the truffles are in trouble, Mother Superior. Not enough rain.”\nNo more truffles? Odrade hesitated on the edge of bringing a Communications acolyte from the rear and asking Weather if this dryness could be corrected.\nShe glanced back at her attendants. Three rows, four people in each row, specialists to extend her observational powers and carry out orders. And look at that bus following them! One of the larger such vehicles on Chapterhouse. Thirty meters long, at least! Crammed with people! Dust whirled across and around it.\nTamalane rode back there at Odrade’s orders. Mother Superior could be peppery when aroused, everyone thought. Tam had brought too many people but Odrade had discovered it too late for changes.\n“Not an inspection! A damned invasion!” Follow my lead, Tam. A little political drama. Make transition easier.\nShe returned her attention to the driver, only male in this car. Clairby, a vinegary little transport expert. Pinched-up face, skin the color of newly turned damp earth. Odrade’s favorite driver. Fast, safe, and wary of limits of his machine.\nThey crested a hill and cork oaks thinned out, replaced ahead by fruit orchards surrounding a community.\nBeautiful in this light, Odrade thought. Low buildings of white walls and orange-tiled roofs. An arch-shaded entrance street could be seen far down the slope and, in a line behind it, the tall central structure containing regional overview offices.\nThe sight reassured Odrade. The community had a glowing look softened by distance and a haze rising from its ring orchards. Branches still bare up here in this winter belt but surely capable of at least one more crop.\nThe Sisterhood demanded a certain beauty in its surroundings, she reminded herself. A cosseting that provided support for the senses without subtracting from needs of the stomach. Comfort where possible... but not too much!\nSomeone behind Odrade said: “I do believe some of those trees are starting to leaf.”\nOdrade took a more careful look. Yes! Tiny bits of green on dark boughs. Winter had slipped here. Weather Control, struggling to make seasonal shifts, could not prevent occasional mistakes. The expanding desert was creating higher temperatures too early here: odd warming patches that caused plants to leaf or bloom just in time for an abrupt frost. Dieback of plantations was becoming much too common.\nA Field Advisor had dredged up the ancient term “Indian Summer” for a report illustrated by projections of an orchard in full blossom being assaulted by snow. Odrade had felt memory stirring at the advisor’s words.\nIndian Summer. How appropriate!\nHer councillors sharing that little view of their planet’s travail recognized the metaphor of a marauding freeze coming on the heels of inappropriate warmth: an unexpected revival of warm weather, a time when raiders could plague their neighbors.\nRemembering, Odrade felt the chill of the hunter’s axe. How soon? She dared not seek the answer. /’m not a Kwisatz Haderach!\nWithout turning, Odrade spoke to Streggi. “This place, Pondrille, have you ever been here?”\n“It was not my postulant center, Mother Superior, but | presume it is similar.”\nYes, these communities were much alike: mostly low structures set in garden plots and orchards, school centers for specific training. It was a screening system for prospective Sisters, the mesh finer the closer you got to Central.\nSome of these communities such as Pondrille concentrated on toughening their charges. They sent women out for long hours every day to manual labor. Hands that grubbed in dirt and became stained with fruit seldom balked at muckier tasks later in life.\nNow that they were out of the dust, Clairby opened the windows. Heat poured in! What was Weather doing?\nTwo buildings at the edge of Pondrille had been joined one story above the street, forming a long tunnel. All it needed, Odrade thought, was a portcullis to duplicate a town gate out of pre-space history. Armored knights would not find the dusky heat of this entry unfamiliar. It was defined in dark plastone, visually identical to stone. Comeye apertures overhead surely were places where guardians lay in wait.\nThe long, shaded entry to the community was clean, she saw. Nostrils were seldom assailed by rot or other offensive odors in Bene Gesserit communities. No slums. Few cripples hobbling along the walks. Much healthy flesh. Good management took care to keep a healthy population happy.\nWe have our disabled, though. And not all of them physically disabled.\nClairby parked just within the exit from the shaded street and they emerged. Tamalane’s bus pulled to a stop behind them.\nOdrade had hoped the entry passage would provide relief from the heat but perversity of nature had made an oven of the place and the temperature actually increased here. She was glad to pass through into the clear light of the central Square where sweat burning off her body provided a few seconds of coolness.\nThe illusion of relief passed abruptly as the sun scorched her head and shoulders. She was forced to call on metabolic control to adjust her body heat.\nWater splashed in a reflecting circle at the central square, a careless display that soon would have to end.\nLeave it for now. Morale!\nShe heard her companions following, the usual groans against “sitting too long in one position.” A greeting delegation could be seen hurrying from the far side of the square. Odrade recognized Tsimpay, Pondrille’s leader, in the van.\nMother Superior’s attendants moved onto the blue tiles of the fountain plaza—all except Streggi, who stood at Odrade’s shoulder. Tamalane’s group, too, was attracted to splashing water. All part and parcel of a human dream so ancient it could never be completely discarded, Odrade thought.\nFertile fields and open water—clear, potable water you can dip your face into for thirst-quenching relief.\nIndeed, some of her party were doing just that at the fountain. Their faces glistened with dampness.\nThe Pondrille delegation came to a stop near Odrade while still on the blue tiles of the fountain plaza. Tsimpay had brought three other Reverend Mothers and five older acolytes.\nNear the Agony, all of those acolytes, Odrade observed. Showing their awareness of the trial in directness of gaze.\nTsimpay was someone Odrade saw infrequently at Central where she came sometimes as a teacher. She was looking fit: brown hair so dark it appeared reddish-black in this light. The narrow face was almost bleak in its austerity. Her features centered on all-blue eyes under heavy brows.\n“We are glad to see you, Mother Superior.” Sounded as though she meant it.\nOdrade inclined her head, a minimal gesture. / hear you. Why are you so glad to see me?\nTsimpay understood. She gestured to a tall, hollow- cheeked Reverend Mother beside her. “You remember Fali, our Orchard Mistress? Fali has just been to me witha delegation of gardeners. A serious complaint.”\nFali’s weathered face looked a bit gray. Overworked? She had a thin mouth above a sharp chin. Dirt under her fingernails. Odrade noted it with approval. Not afraid to join in the grubbing.\nDelegation of gardeners. So there was an escalation of complaints. Must have been serious. Not like Tsimpay to dump it on Mother Superior.\n“Let’s hear it,” Odrade said.\nWith a glance at Tsimpay, Fali went through a detailed recital, even providing qualifications of delegation leaders. All of them good people, of course.\nOdrade recognized the pattern. There had been conferences concerning this inevitable consequence. Tsimpay in attendance at some of them. How could you explain to your people that a distant sandworm (perhaps not even in existence yet) required this change? How could you explain to farmers that it was nota matter of “just a bit more rain” but went straight to the heart of the planet’s total weather. More rain here could mean a diversion of high-altitude winds. That in its turn would change things elsewhere, cause moisture-laden siroccos where they would\nbe not only upsetting but also dangerous. Too easy to bring on great tornadoes if you inserted the wrong conditions. A planet’s weather was no simple thing to treat with easy adjustments. As / have sometimes demanded. Each time, there was a total equation to be scanned.\n“The planet casts the final vote,” Odrade said. It was an old reminder in the Sisterhood of human fallibility.\n“Does Dune still have a vote?” Fali asked. More bitterness in the question than Odrade had anticipated.\n“| feel the heat. We saw the leaves on your orchards as we arrived,” Odrade said. / know what concerns you, Sister.\n“We will lose part of the crop this year,” Fali said. Accusation in her words: This is your fault!\n“What did you tell your delegation?” Odrade asked.\n“That the desert must grow and Weather no longer can make every adjustment we need.”\nTruth. The agreed response. Inadequate, as truth often was, but all they had now. Something would have to give soon. Meanwhile, more delegations and loss of crops.\n“Will you take tea with us, Mother Superior?” Tsimpay, the diplomat, intervening. You see how it is escalating, Mother Superior? Fali will now go back to dealing with fruits and vegetables. Her proper place. Message delivered.\nStreggi cleared her throat.\nThat damnable gesture will have to be suppressed! But the meaning was clear. Streggi had been put in charge of their schedule. We must be going.\n“We got a late start,” Odrade said. “We stopped only to stretch our legs and see if you have problems you cannot meet on your own.”\n“We can handle the gardeners, Mother Superior.”\nTsimpay’s brisk tone said much more and Odrade almost smiled.\nInspect if you wish, Mother Superior. Look anywhere. You will find Pondrille in Bene Gesserit order.\nOdrade glanced at Tamalane’s bus. Some of the people already were returning to the air-conditioned interior. Tamalane stood by the door, well within earshot.\n“| hear good reports of you, Tsimpay,” Odrade said. “You can do without our interference. | certainly don’t want to intrude on you with an entourage that is far too large\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, responsible for leadership and decision-making in the face of planetary crises and internal dissent)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who has been ordered to contain bad news until an appropriate moment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREGGI<|>PERSON<|>Streggi is an attendant to Mother Superior Odrade, providing updates and managing schedules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Tamalane is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who accompanies Odrade on her travels and oversees a large group of attendants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLAIRBY<|>PERSON<|>Clairby is Odrade's trusted driver, known for his expertise and cautious approach to vehicle limits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TSIMPAY<|>PERSON<|>Tsimpay is the leader of the Pondrille community, responsible for managing local affairs and addressing grievances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALI<|>PERSON<|>Fali is the Orchard Mistress of Pondrille, overseeing agricultural operations and representing the concerns of gardeners)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive Sisterhood with advanced mental and physical training, focused on political and genetic manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a hostile faction that has obliterated several Bene Gesserit planets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapterhouse is the current home planet of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, facing environmental challenges due to desert expansion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PONDRLLE<|>GEO<|>Pondrille is a Bene Gesserit community focused on training and manual labor, located in a region affected by climate shifts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUZZELL<|>GEO<|>Buzzell is one of the remaining planets under Bene Gesserit control, mentioned in the context of planetary losses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune is a legendary desert planet with historical significance to the Bene Gesserit, referenced in discussions about environmental control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN SUMMER<|>EVENT<|>An unexpected warm period followed by frost, used metaphorically to describe the Bene Gesserit's current struggles)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the Sisterhood through crises<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>STREGGI<|>Streggi serves as Odrade's attendant, managing schedules and providing updates<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TAMALANE<|>Tamalane accompanies Odrade on her travels and oversees a large group of attendants<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>CLAIRBY<|>Clairby is Odrade's trusted driver, ensuring safe and efficient travel<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TSIMPAY<|>Tsimpay reports to Odrade as the leader of the Pondrille community<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TSIMPAY<|>FALI<|>Fali is the Orchard Mistress under Tsimpay's leadership, responsible for agricultural concerns<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Honored Matres are a hostile faction that has attacked Bene Gesserit planets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>Chapterhouse is the current home planet of the Bene Gesserit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>PONDRLLE<|>Pondrille is a training community under Bene Gesserit control<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>BUZZELL<|>Buzzell is one of the remaining planets under Bene Gesserit control<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>DUNE<|>Dune holds historical significance for the Bene Gesserit, referenced in discussions about environmental control<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PONDRLLE<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>Pondrille is a community located on Chapterhouse, affected by its environmental changes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FALI<|>PONDRLLE<|>Fali oversees the orchards and agricultural operations in Pondrille<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIAN SUMMER<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>The term 'Indian Summer' is used metaphorically to describe the environmental struggles on Chapterhouse<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
