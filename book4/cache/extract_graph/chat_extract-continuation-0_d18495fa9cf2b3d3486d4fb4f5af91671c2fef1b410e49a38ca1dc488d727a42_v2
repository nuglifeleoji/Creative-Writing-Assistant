买个虚名。再说，你什么情况也不了解，就准备到电视台去赚钱？而要是白扔一两万块钱给电视台，你还不如拿这钱给咱双水村办个什么事……” \n　　“拿一两万块钱白给村里人办事？” \n　　“那又怎样？你不是也准备白扔给人家电视台吗？”“我还准备赚它电视台的钱呢！” \n　　“赚不了呢？” \n　　“那只怪运气不好！” \n　　少平笑了：“说来说去，你这个财主看来并不是象你说的那样，想给社会疏点财……” \n　　“要是白给村里人办事，还不如把这钱咱们一家人分了！”“两回事，哥哥，你对家里人都已尽了责任。父母新建的家院，按你们来信说的情况，我推算我那点钱建不起来这么排场的地方。你出了至少多出我两倍的钱。就是妹妹，她假期回去，你都给了她不少钱。最近又听说你把姐夫也拉扯到了你的砖瓦厂……” \n　　“至于我，你很了解，我现在不会用你的钱。我赚的钱我够用。不够用我也不愿使用你的钱。这不是我和你之间有了隔阂，不，我们永远是亲密的兄弟。我以前就说过，最好的兄弟首先应该是朋友，然后才是弟兄。不知你听说没有，在外国，有些百万富翁或亿万富翁的子女拒绝接受父母的遗产，而靠自己的劳动来度过一生。我理解这些人。如果我处在他们的位置上，我也会这样做。比如说吧，要是爸爸不是个农民，而是个什么大官，有许多钱，我也不会要他的。那是他赚的，他自己情愿怎花哩！花不了扔到河里也可以！反正我不会接受他的馈赠……” \n　　孙少安难以理解弟弟这些“高论”。不过，他也开始认真地检讨起他此次的省城之行是否适当……的确，他什么情况也不了解，就准备拿一两万块钱去冒险。一两万块对于拍《三国演义》来说实在微不足道；但对他个人来说，等于拿自己的一半积蓄去开一次玩笑。他本质上可不属于这种胆大妄为的人！ \n　　可是，现在上了胡永合的钩杆，怎样才能下来呢？他如今已经被这家伙引到了半路上！ \n　　“你倒究欠那家伙多少人情？”少平问哥哥。他已经看出，哥哥对他的行为有点动摇了。 \n　　少安说：“实际上也没什么。我困难时，他给原北县一个熟人写了封信，让我去那里找这人替我贷了点款。可没过几天，那个人就撵来要钱，逼得我几乎要上吊……”“那就去他妈的，你不去省城了！” \n　　“怎找借口哩？” \n　　少平看哥哥真的有了转意，想了一下，出主意说：“你就说今晚上家里打来长途电话，虎子或燕子住了医院，急病！” \n　　少安白了弟弟一眼，嫌他出了这么一个不吉利的主意。少平赶忙笑着改口说：“干\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
