  “我是不知道你怎么想，我只不过是想跟你复合罢了。这样拜托你，真有那么罪大恶极吗？”\n    “我不是说过我毫无意愿吗？就连你自己，应该也不相信我会答应吧。你只不过是借着这个理由来纠缠我。”\n    看来应该是说对了，不过富坚并未回答，径自抓起遥控器打开电视，动画节目开始了。\n    靖子吐出一口气，走向厨房。钱包放在料理台旁边的抽屉，她从里面抽出两张万元大钞。\n    “收下这个就请回吧。”她把钱往暖桌一放。\n    “你这是干嘛？你不是说绝不给钱吗？”\n    “这是最后一次。”\n    “我才不稀罕这种东西。”\n    “你是绝不会空着手走吧？我知道你想要更多，但我们手头也很紧。”\n    富坚凝视这两万元，然后望着靖子。\n    “真拿你没办法。那，我就回去好了。不过我可要声明，我说过我不要钱喔。是你硬要塞给我的。”\n    富坚把两万元大钞往口袋胡乱一塞，将烟蒂扔进空罐中，从暖桌抽身站起。但他没走向玄关，却走近后面房间，突然拉开纸门。美里的惊叫声响起。\n    “你干什么！”靖子尖声大喊。\n    “跟继女打个招呼应该不会怎样吧。”\n    “她现在已经不是你的女儿了，跟你毫无瓜葛。”\n    “没那么严重把，那我走喽。美里，改天见。”富坚对着房间里面说道。靖子看不见美里在做什么。\n    富坚终于走向玄关，“她将来肯定会是个美女，真令人期待。”\n    “你少胡说八道。”\n    “这怎么会是胡说，再过个三年她就能赚钱了，到时候每一家都会很乐意雇用她。”\n    “别开玩笑了！快走！”\n    “我会走啦――至少今天会。”\n    “你绝对不能再来。”\n    “这我就不敢保证了。”\n    “你……”\n    “我可要提醒你，你逃不出我的手掌心，该死心的是你。”富坚低声笑了，然后弯下腰穿鞋。\n    就在这时候。靖子背后传来的声音。当她转头时，只见身穿制服的美里已站在她身边，美里挥起某种东西。\n    靖子来不及阻止，也来不及出声。美里已朝富坚的后脑打了下去。钝重的声音响起，富坚当场倒下。\n
