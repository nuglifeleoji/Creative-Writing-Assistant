What a shock for the gentle Hwi!”\n“I told you the truth about that long ago,” Leto said.\n“Nobody tells the truth,” Malky husked.\n“You often told me the truth,” Leto said. “Even when you didn’t know it.”\n“That’s because you’re cleverer than the rest of us.”\n“Will you tell me about Hwi?”\n“I think you already know it.”\n“I want to hear it from you,” Leto said. “Did you get help from the Tleilaxu?”\n“They gave us knowledge, nothing more. Everything else we did for ourselves.”\n“I thought it was not the Tleilaxu’s doing.”\nMoneo could no longer contain his curiosity. “Lord, what is this of Hwi and Tleilaxu? Why do you...”\n“Here there, old friend Moneo,” Malky said, rolling his gaze toward the majordomo. “Don’t you know what he...”\n“I was never your friend!” Moneo snapped.\n“Companion among the houris then,” Malky said.\n“Lord,” Moneo said, turning toward Leto, “why do you speak of...”\n“Shhh, Moneo,” Leto said. “We are tiring your old companion and | have things to learn from him yet.”\n“Did you ever wonder, Leto,” Malky asked, “why Moneo never tried to take the whole shebang away from you?”\n“The what?” Moneo demanded.\n“Another of Leto’s old words,” Malky said. “She and bang —shebang. It’s perfect. Why don’t you rename your Empire, Leto? The Grand Shebang!”\nLeto raised a hand to silence Moneo. “Will you tell me, Malky? About Hwi?”\n“Just a few tiny cells from my body,” Malky said. “Then the carefully nurtured growth and education—everything an exact opposite to your old friend Malky. We did it all in the no-room where you cannot see!”\n“But | notice when something vanishes,” Leto said.\n“No-room?” Moneo asked, then as the import of Malky’s words sank home: “You? You and Hwi.. .”\n“That is the shape | saw in the shadows,” Leto said.\nMoneo looked full at Leto’s face. “Lord, | will call off the wedding. | will say...”\n“You will do nothing of the kind!”\n“But Lord, if she and Malky are...”\n“Moneo,” Malky husked. “Your Lord commands and you must obey!”\nThat mocking tone! Moneo glared at Malky.\n“The exact opposite of Malky,” Leto said. “Didn’t you hear him?”\n“What could be better?” Malky asked.\n“But surely, Lord, if you now know...”\n“Moneo,” Leto said, “you are beginning to disturb me.”\nMoneo fell into abashed silence.\nLeto said: “That’s better. You know, Moneo, once tens of thousands of years ago when | was another person, | made a mistake.”\n“You, a mistake?” Malky mocked.\nLeto merely smiled. “My mistake was compounded by the beautiful way in which | expressed it.”\n“Tricks with words,” Malky taunted.\n“Indeed! This is what | said: ‘The present is distraction; the future a dream; only memory can unlock the meaning of life.’ Aren’t those beautiful words, Malky?”\n“Exquisite, old worm.”\nMoneo put a hand over his mouth.\n“But my words were a foolish lie,” Leto said. “I knew it at the time, but | was infatuated with the beautiful words. No— memory unlocks no meanings. Without anguish of the spirit, which is a wordless experience, there are no meanings anywhere.”\n“I fail to see the meaning of the anguish caused me by your bloody Fish Speakers,” Malky said.\n“You're suffering no anguish,” Leto said.\n“If you were in this body, you'd...”\n“That’s just physical pain,” Leto said. “It will end soon.”\n“Then when will | know the anguish?” Malky asked.\n“Perhaps later.”\nLeto flexed his front segments away from Malky to face Moneo. “Do you really serve the Golden Path, Moneo?”\n“Ahhh, the Golden Path,” Malky taunted.\n“You know | do, Lord,” Moneo said.\n“Then you must promise me,” Leto said, “that what you have learned here must never pass your lips. Not by word or\nSign can you reveal it.”\n“|I promise, Lord.”\n“He promises, Lord,” Malky sneered.\nOne of Leto’s tiny hands gestured at Malky, who lay staring up at the blunt profile of a face within its gray cowl. “For reasons of old admiration and .. . many other reasons, | cannot kill Malky. | cannot even ask it of you... yet he must be eliminated.”\n“Ohhh, how clever you are!” Malky said.\n“Lord, if you will wait at the other end of the chamber,” Moneo said. “Perhaps when you return Malky no longer will be a problem.”\n“He’s going to do it,” Malky husked. “Gods below! He’s going to do it.”\nLeto squirmed away and went to the shadowed limit of the chamber, keeping his attention on the faint arc of a line which would become an opening into the night if he merely converted the wish into a thought-of-command. What a long drop that would be out there—just roll off the landing-lip. He doubted that even his body would survive it. But there was no water in the sand beneath his tower and he could feel the Golden Path winking in and out of existence merely because he allowed himself to think of such an end.\n“Leto!” Malky called from behind him.\nLeto heard the litter grating on the wind-scattered sand which peppered the floor of his aerie.\nOnce more, Malky called: “Leto, you are the best! There’s no evil in this universe which can surpass...”\nA sodden thump shut off Malky’s voice. A blow to the throat, Leto thought. Yes, Moneo knows that one. There came the sound of the balcony’s transparent shield sliding open, the rasping of the litter on the rail, then silence.\nMoneo will have to bury the body in the sand, Leto thought. There is as yet no worm to come and devour the evidence. Leto turned then and looked across the chamber.\nMoneo stood leaning over the railing, peering down... down...down...\nI cannot pray for you, Malky, nor for you, Moneo, Leto thought. / may be the only religious consciousness in the Empire because I| am truly alone. . . so I cannot pray.\nYou cannot understand history unless you understand its flowings, its currents and the ways leaders move within such forces. A leader tries to perpetuate the conditions which demand his leadership. Thus, the leader requires the outsider. | caution you to examine my career with care. | am both leader and outsider. Do not make the mistake of assuming that I only created the Church which was the State. That was my function as leader and | had many historical models to use as pattern. For a clue to my role as outsider, look at the arts of my time. The arts are barbaric. The favorite poetry? The Epic. The popular dramatic ideal? Heroism. Dances? Wildly abandoned. From Moneo’s viewpoint, he is correct in describing this as dangerous. It stimulates the imagination. It makes people feel the lack of that which I have taken from them. What did | take from them? The right to participate in history.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho, stretched out on his cot with his eyes closed, heard\na weight drop onto the other cot. He sat up into the midafternoon light which slanted through the room’s single window at a sharp angle, reflecting off the white-tiled floor onto the light yellow walls. Siona, he saw, had come in and stretched herself on her cot. She already was reading one of the books she carried around with her in a green fabric pack.\nWhy books? he wondered.\nHe swung his feet to the floor and glanced around the room. How could this high-ceilinged, spacious box be considered even remotely Fremen? A wide table/desk of some dark brown local plastic separated the two cots. There were two doors. One led directly outside across a garden. The other admitted them to a luxurious bath whose pale blue tiles glistened under a broad skylight. The bath contained, among its many functional services, a sunken tub and a shower, each at least two meters square. The\ndoor to this sybaritic space remained open and Idaho could hear water running out of the tub. Siona appeared oddly fond of bathing in an excess of water.\nStilgar, Idaho’s Naib of the ancient days on Dune, would have looked on that room with scorn. “Shameful!” he would have said. “Decadent! Weak!” Stilgar would have used many scornful words about this entire village which dared to compare itself with a true Fremen sietch.\nPaper rustled as Siona turned a page. She lay with her head propped on two pillows, a thin white robe covering her body. The robe still revealed clinging wetness from her bath.\nIdaho shook his head. What was it on those pages which held her interest this way? She had been reading and re- reading since their arrival at Tuono. The volumes were thin but numerous, bearing only numbers on their black bindings. Idaho had seen a number nine.\nSwinging his feet to the floor, he stood and went to the window. There was an old man out there at a distance, digging in flowers. The garden was protected by buildings on three sides. The flowers bore large blossoms—red on the outside but, when they unfolded, white in the center. The old Man’s uncovered gray hair was a kind of blossom waving among the floral white and jeweled buds. Idaho smelled moldering leaves and freshly turned dirt against a background of pungent floral perfume.\nA Fremen tending flowers in the open!\nSiona volunteered nothing about her strange reading matter. She’s taunting me, Idaho thought. She wants me to ask.\nHe tried not to think about Hwi. Rage threatened to engulf him when he did. He remembered the Fremen word for that intense emotion: kanawa, the iron ring of jealousy. Where is Hwi? What is she doing at this moment?\nThe door from the garden opened without a knock and Teishar, an aide to Garun, entered. Teishar had a dead colored face full of dark wrinkles. His eyes were sunken with\npale yellow around the pupils. Teishar wore a brown robe. He had hair like old grass that had been left out to rot. He seemed unnecessarily ugly, like a dark and elemental spirit. Teishar closed the door and stood there looking at them.\nSiona’s voice came from behind Idaho. “Well, what is it?”\nIdaho noticed then that Teishar seemed strangely excited, vibrating with it.\n“The God Emperor...” Teishar cleared his throat and began again. “The God Emperor will come to Tuono!”\nSiona sat upright on the bed, folding her white robe over her knees. Idaho glanced back at her, then once more\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a central figure in the narrative with immense power and influence over the Empire.
