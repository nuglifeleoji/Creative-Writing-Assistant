�天也会看到月亮。对于大气层之外的宇宙，人们有一种深深的麻木感。1987年9月的那次日环食使很多人隔着熏黑的玻璃片儿望了天空十几分钟，但并没有使多少人对大气层外的宇宙有更深的感受。超新星的表演要比日全食壮丽十倍，但人们对大地之外事物的麻木感更是百倍地深，象以前的很多次一样，大多数人准备很快地忘掉昨天夜里的事。超新星固然神奇，但也就是神奇而已，想它干什么呢？赶紧埋头生活吧！\n　　但人们很快发现事情没有那么简单。\n　　广场周围的几个照像服务部首先发现了一件不可思议的事：所有的胶卷全部曝光了！这现象很快在城市的别处也发现了，所有的出售胶卷的商店和电影制片厂都紧急抽查自己的胶卷，结果竟无一例外！事实上，在这一天的世界上，感光摄影已成为不可能.人们还发现了其它许多怪现象：空气中的静电大得惊人，只要用手一摸头发，就会发出一阵噼啪声；许多树木在一两个小时内突然发芽，但长出的叶子奇形怪状；广场上的许多花草发出一种奇异的浓香；所有的动物都急躁不安，鸟群在空中疯狂地翻飞，直到累得摔到地上；\n　　狗在不停地狂吠，在动物园的附近甚至可以听到凄厉的狼嚎。到中午时，公路上竟出现了蛇！\n　　人们在惊叹胶卷曝光造成的损失的同时，终于看到大气层之外的那个无边的宇宙和他们的生活并非毫无关系。\n　　不知不觉到了傍晚，天黑了下来。初降的夜色掩去了城市中平凡的东西，却突出了她不平凡的东西。长安街上伸向远方的两排路灯发出桔红色的柔光，与西天的余辉和谐地相衬着，这路灯与晚霞汇成的柔光，对离家远行的人是一种抚慰；广场周围的建筑在夜色显得古朴而凝重，和脚下的大地紧紧地凝为一体，这时置身于这个宁静的广场就象扑进一个温暖的怀抱，足以使所有骚动不安的心平静下来。黄昏后的北京是一个温暖的城市，这时她的空气中充满一种可信赖的归宿感，这归宿感同古城墙的地基一样古老，时光的潮水涨了又落落了又涨，一代代的人来了又去去了又来，但每天的这时，那古老的归宿感就从城市下面某一层过去的泥土中缓缓地，幽灵般地溢出来，渗入城市的电线网，再从路灯和高层建筑无数个窗口的灯光中，从闪动的霓虹灯中，散发到空气里。\n　　这时，即使是一个流落街头的独孤的流浪者，也像是漫步在自家的庭院中。\n　　但这是古城最后一个这样的傍晚了。\n　　最初的不安迹象是在晚8\n######################\nOutput:",
