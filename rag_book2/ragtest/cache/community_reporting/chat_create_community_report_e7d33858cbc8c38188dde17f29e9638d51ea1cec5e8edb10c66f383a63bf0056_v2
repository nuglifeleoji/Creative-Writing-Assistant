Additionally, the company has been accused of plagiarizing the *Submarine* program, raising concerns about intellectual property violations.  \n\nIn summary, 无限企划 operates as a computer game distribution business but is embroiled in controversy over its alleged involvement in the unauthorized dissemination and possible theft of software, particularly the *Submarine* program. Despite these issues, it remains linked to Kirihara and Tomohiko, with indications that it may have ties to ongoing or revived projects in game development.\",8\n244,SUBMARINE,\"**SUBMARINE** is a computer game program originally developed by students at North Osaka University's Sixth Research Laboratory, under the leadership of Masaharu and his research team.

However, the program was allegedly leaked or stolen by the company \"\"无限企划\"\" (Mugen Kikaku), which later claimed it as their own flagship game. According to some accounts, the game was provided to the company by an individual named Kirihara (桐原), though the circumstances surrounding this transfer remain unclear. The incident has been described as a case of plagiarism, with the original creators accusing \"\"无限企划\"\" of appropriating their work without authorization. Despite the controversy, **SUBMARINE** remains recognized as a student-led project from North Osaka University, highlighting both its innovative origins and the disputed nature of its later commercialization.\",6\n245,MARINE CRASH,\"**MARINE CRASH** is a computer game sold by *Unlimited Planning* (无限企划). The game is similar in concept to *Submarine* and was named by Nami-e, who proposed the title \"\"Marine Crash,\"\" which was later adopted by Kirihara. However, there are allegations that *MARINE CRASH* may have plagiarized the *Submarine* program, raising questions about its originality.  \n\nIn summary, *MARINE CRASH* is a game developed and marketed by *Unlimited Planning*, bearing a name suggested by Nami-e and approved by Kirihara. While it shares similarities with *Submarine*, its legitimacy has been challenged due to suspicions of program plagiarism. The exact nature of its relationship to *Submarine* remains unclear, but the controversy suggests potential unauthorized use of the original game's design or code.\",3\n288,UNLIMITED PLANNING,\"Unlimited Planning is a company that sells computer games via mail order, including a game called 'Marine Crash' which is very similar to the 'Submarine' game created by the students at the university.\",3\n293,MINOBU,Minobu is a graduate student at the Sixth Research Laboratory who is concerned about the potential leak of their 'Submarine' game to Unlimited Planning.,2\n292,NAGATA,Nagata is a student from the Third Research Laboratory who noticed the similarity between 'Marine Crash' and 'Submarine' and brought it to the attention of the Sixth Research Laboratory.,2\n290,SIXTH RESEARCH LABORATORY,The Sixth Research Laboratory is part of the Faculty of Engineering at North Osaka University where Zheng Qing and his colleagues work on their research and develop games like 'Submarine'.,2\n291,THIRD RESEARCH LABORATORY,The Third Research Laboratory is another research group at North Osaka University where students like Nagata are involved in similar projects.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n391,无限企划,SUBMARINE,\"**无限企划 (Mugen Kikaku)** is a company or organization associated with a program or product named **SUBMARINE**.

However, there are conflicting claims regarding the origins of the SUBMARINE program. One source suggests that the program was leaked to 无限企划 (\"\"The 'Submarine' program was allegedly leaked to '无限企划'\"\"), while another alleges that 无限企划 may have plagiarized or misappropriated the SUBMARINE program (“无限企划”涉嫌剽窃“Submarine”程序).  \n\nTo reconcile these contradictions, it appears that SUBMARINE is closely tied to 无限企划, either as a key product developed by the company or as a program acquired or appropriated through disputed means. The exact nature of 无限企划's relationship with SUBMARINE remains unclear, with competing narratives suggesting either legitimate ownership or questionable acquisition. Further clarification would be needed to determine whether the program was internally developed, leaked externally, or improperly taken from another source.  \n\nIn summary, 无限企划 is prominently linked to SUBMARINE, but the circumstances surrounding its association are subject to conflicting claims, ranging from legitimate product development to allegations of plagiarism or unauthorized acquisition.\",14\n392,SUBMARINE,MARINE CRASH,Marine Crash是Submarine游戏的名称,9\n432,MARINE CRASH,SUBMARINE,\"'Marine Crash' is very similar to the 'Submarine' game, suggesting possible plagiarism\",9\n426,UNLIMITED PLANNING,MINOBU,Minobu suspects that someone from their research group leaked the 'Submarine' game to Unlimited Planning.,5\n427,UNLIMITED PLANNING,NAGATA,Nagata discovered the similarity between 'Marine Crash' and 'Submarine' and alerted the Sixth Research Laboratory.,5\n429,SIXTH RESEARCH LABORATORY,MINOBU,Minobu is a graduate student working in the Sixth Research Laboratory.,4\n431,THIRD RESEARCH LABORATORY,NAGATA,Nagata is a student from the Third Research Laboratory.,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
