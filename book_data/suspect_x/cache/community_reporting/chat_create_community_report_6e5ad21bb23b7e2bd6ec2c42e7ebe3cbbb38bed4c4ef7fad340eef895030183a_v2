Spanning from 201 B.G. to 108 B.G., this crusade sought to eradicate artificial intelligence and machines that simulated human cognition, driven by a desire to preserve human autonomy, essence, and judgment. Its aftermath led to the strict prohibition of thinking machines, influencing the Imperium's feudal structure and establishing human-centric governance.  \n\nThe Jihad's cultural and religious impact was profound, embedding deep-seated taboos against artificial intelligence and machine-like thinking. It shaped the Bene Gesserit's doctrines, reinforcing their reliance on human memory (such as their Archives) and their prohibitions against artificial insemination. The conflict also spurred the rise of human mental disciplines, including the Bene Gesserit's mental training and the development of **mentats**—human computers trained to replace mechanical calculation.  \n\nReferences to the Jihad appear in various contexts, from **Leto II's** ambiguous relationship with technology—where he upholds its prohibitions while potentially violating them—to **Waff's** comparisons with the Honored Matres' logic. The event is often cited as a cautionary tale, illustrating the dangers of machine dependency and the ethical dilemmas surrounding artificial intelligence.  \n\nThough some interpretations suggest contradictions—such as whether the Jihad was a rebellion, a crusade, or a war—the consensus remains that it was a defining uprising against machine-logic, leaving lasting repercussions on technology, religion, and societal organization. Its legacy endures in the prohibition of devices like the **Ixian memocorder** and the destruction of libraries, ensuring human dominance over machine intelligence.  \n\nIn summary, the Butlerian Jihad was a transformative historical event that eradicated thinking machines, enforced human supremacy, and laid the foundation for the Imperium's technological and ideological frameworks. Its influence persists across millennia, shaping the ethical and political boundaries of the Dune universe.\",17\n876,HARQ AL-ADA,\"**HARQ AL-ADA** is a multifaceted historical figure, philosopher, and chronicler within the *Dune* universe, renowned for his contributions to Fremen wisdom and Atreides history. He is the author of several significant works, including *\"\"Riddles of Arrakis,\"\"* a text that encapsulates Fremen teachings and intellectual challenges, and *\"\"The Holy Metamorphosis,\"\"* which analyzes the actions and legacy of Leto II. Additionally, he penned *\"\"The Story of Liet-Kynes,\"\"* a referenced account of the famed planetologist, and *\"\"The Testament of Arrakis,\"\"* documenting the achievements of Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides).  \n\nHarq al-Ada is also recognized as a reconstructor and interpreter of Muad'Dib's teachings, providing valuable insights into his father's philosophies. His role as a chronicler extends to familial and political spheres; he is mentioned as an observer of the relationship between Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, as well as Ghanima's mate and an ancestor of the Atreides line. Through his lineage, he is connected to Siona Atreides, further cementing his place in Atreides oral history.  \n\nNotably, Harq al-Ada shares a resemblance to the historical figure Nyshae, revealing a shared Corrino bloodline, which adds another layer to his complex heritage.
