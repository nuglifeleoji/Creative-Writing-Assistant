What if he could not slay her?\n“How dare you keep suggesting a bargain with an Honored Matre?” she demanded. “Know you that we set the price!”\n“I do not Know your ways, Honored Matre,” Waff said. “But | sense in your words that | have offended.”\n“Apology accepted.”\nNo apology intended! He stared at her blandly. Many things could be deduced from her performance. Out of his millennial experiences, Waff reviewed what he had learned here. This female from the Scattering came to him for an essential piece of information. Therefore, she had no other source. He sensed desperation in her. Well masked but definitely there. She needed confirmation or refutation of something she feared.\nHow like a predatory bird she was, sitting there with her claw hands so lightly on the arms of her chair! Rot at the core spreads outward. He had said it and she had not heard. Clearly, atomic humankind continued to explode on its\nScatterings of Scatterings. The people represented by this Honored Matre had not found a way to trace the no-ships. That was it, of course. She hunted the no-ships just as the witches of the Bene Gesserit did.\n“You seek the way to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility,” he said.\nThe statement obviously rocked her. She had not expected this from the elflike manikin seated in front of her. He saw fear, then anger, then resolution pass across her features before she resumed her predatory mask. She knew, though. She knew he had seen.\n“So that is what you do with your ghola,” she said.\n“It is what the witches of the Bene Gesserit seek with him,” Waff lied.\n“I underestimated you,” she said. “Did you make the same mistake with me?”\n“I do not think so, Honored Matre. The breeding scheme that produced you is quite obviously formidable. | think you could kick out a foot and kill me before | blinked an eye. The witches are not in the same league with you.”\nA smile of pleasure softened her features. “Are the Tleilaxu to be our willing servants or compelled?”\nHe did not try to hide outrage. “You offer us slavery?”\n“That is one of your options.”\nHe had her now! Arrogance was her weakness. Submissively, he asked: “What would you command me to do?”\n“You will take back as your guests two younger Honored Matres. They are to be bred with you and... teach you our ways of ecstasy.”\nWaff inhaled and exhaled two slow breaths.\n“Are you sterile?” she asked.\n“Only our Face Dancers are mules.” She would already know that. It was common knowledge.\n“You call yourself Master,” she said, “yet you have not mastered yourself.”\nMore than you, Honored Matre bitch! And | call myself Masheikh, a fact that may yet destroy you.\n“The two Honored Matres | send with you will make an inspection of everything Tleilaxu and return to me with their report,” she said.\nHe sighed as though in resignation. “Are the two younger women comely?”\n“Honored Matres!” she corrected him.\n“Is that the only name you use?”\n“If they choose to give you names, that is their privilege, not yours.” She leaned sideways and rapped a bony knuckle against the floor. Metal gleamed in her hand. She had a way of penetrating this room’s shielding!\nThe hatch opened and two women dressed much like his Honored Matre entered. Their dark capes carried less decoration and both women were younger. Waff stared at them. Were they both... He tried not to show elation but knew he failed. No matter. The older one would think he admired the beauty of these two. By signs known only to the Masters, he saw that one of the two newcomers was a new Face Dancer. A successful exchange had been made and these Scattered Ones could not detect it! The Tleilaxu had successfully passed a hurdle! Would the Bene Gesserit be as blind to these new gholas?\n“You are being sensibly agreeable about this, for which you will be rewarded,” the old Honored Matre said.\n“| recognize your powers, Honored Matre,” he said. That was true. He bowed his head to conceal the resolution that he knew he could not keep from his eyes.\nShe gestured to the newcomers. “These two will accompany you. Their slightest whim is your command. They will be treated with all honor and respect.”\n“Of course, Honored Matre.” Keeping his head bowed, he lifted both arms as though in salutation and submission. A dart hissed from each sleeve. As he released the darts, Waff jerked himself sideways in his chair. The motion was not\nquite rapid enough. The old Honored Matre’s right foot shot out, catching him in the left thigh and hurling him backward on his chair.\nIt was the old Honored Matre’s last living act. The dart from his left sleeve caught her in the back of her throat, entering through her opened mouth, a mouth left gaping in Surprise. Narcotic poison cut off any outcry. The other dart hit the non-Face Dancer of the newcomers in the right eye. His Face Dancer accomplice cut off any warning shout by a blurred chop to the throat.\nTwo bodies slumped in death.\nPainfully, Waff disentangled himself from the chair and righted it as he got to his feet. His thigh throbbed. A fraction of a meter more and she would have broken his thigh! He realized that her reaction had not been mediated by her central nervous system. As with some insects, attack could be initiated by the required muscle system. That development would have to be investigated!\nHis Face Dancer accomplice was listening at the open hatch. She stepped aside to allow the entry of another Face Dancer in the guise of an Ixian guard.\nWaff massaged his injured thigh while his Face Dancers disrobed the dead women. The one who copied the Ixian put her head to that of the dead old Honored Matre. Things moved swiftly after that. Presently, there was no Ixian guard, only a faithful copy of the old Honored Matre and a younger Honored Matre attendant. Another pseudo-lxian entered and copied the younger Honored Matre. Soon, there were only ashes where dead flesh had been. A new Honored Matre scooped the ashes into a bag and concealed it beneath her robe.\nWaff made a careful examination of the room. The consequences of discovery made him shudder. Such arrogance as he had seen here came from obviously awesome powers. Those powers must be probed. He detained the Face Dancer who had copied the old one.\n“You have printed her?”\n“Yes, Master. Her waking memories were still alive when | copied.”\n“Transfer to her.” He gestured to the one who had been an Ixian guard. They touched foreheads for a few heartbeats then parted.\n“It is done,” said the older one.\n“How many other copies of these Honored Matres have we made?”\n“Four, Master.”\n“None of them detected?”\n“None, Master.”\n“Those four must return to the heartland of these Honored Matres and learn all there is to know about them. One of those four must get back to us with what is learned.”\n“That is impossible, Master.”\n“Impossible?”\n“They have cut themselves off from their source. This is their way, Master. They are a new cell and have established themselves on Gammu.”\n“But surely we could...”\n“Your pardon, Master. The coordinates of their place in the Scattering were contained only in a no-ship’s workings and have been erased.”\n“Their tracks are completely covered?” There was dismay in his voice.\n“Completely, Master.”\nDisaster! He was forced to rein in his thoughts from a sudden frenzied darting. “They must not learn what we have done here,” he muttered.\n“They will not learn from us, Master.”\n“What talents have they developed? What powers? Quickly!”\n“They are what you would expect from a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit but without the melange memories.”\n“You're sure?”\n“There is no hint of it. As you Know, Master, we—”\n“Yes, yes. | know.” He waved her to silence. “But the old one was So arrogant, so...”\n“Your pardon, Master, but time presses. These Honored Matres have perfected the pleasures of sex far beyond that developed by any others.”\n“So it’s true what our informants said.”\n“They went back to the primitive Tantric and developed their own ways of sexual stimulation, Master. Through this, they accept the worship of their followers.”\n“Worship.” He breathed the word. “Are they superior to the Breeding Mistresses of the Sisterhood?”\n“The Honored Matres believe so, Master. Shall we demon\n”\n“No!” Waff dropped his elfin mask at this discovery and assumed the expression of a dominant Master. The Face Dancers nodded their heads in submission. A look of glee came over Waff’s face. The returned Tleilaxu of the Scattering reported truthfully! By a simple mind-print he had confirmed this new weapon of his people!\n“What are your orders, Master?” the old one asked.\nWaff resumed his elfin mask. “We will explore these matters only when we have returned to the Tleilaxu core at Bandalong. Meanwhile, even a Master does not give orders to an Honored Matre. You are my masters until we are free of prying eyes.”\n“Of course, Master. Shall | now convey your orders to the others outside?”\n“Yes, and these are my orders: This no-ship must never return to Gammu. It must vanish without a trace. No Survivors.”\n“It will be done, Master.”\nTechnology, in common with many other activities, tends toward avoidance of risks by investors. Uncertainty is ruled out if possible. Capital investment follows this rule, since people generally prefer the predictable. Few recognize how destructive this can be, how it imposes severe limits on variability and thus makes whole populations fatally vulnerable to the shocking ways our universe can throw the dice.\n—ASSESSMENT OF IX, BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nO n the morning after that initial test in the desert, Sheeana awoke in the priestly complex to find her bed surrounded by white-robed people.\nPriests and priestesses!\n“She’s awake,” a priestess said.\nFear gripped Sheeana. She clutched the bed covers close to her chin while she stared out at those intent faces. Were they going to abandon her in the desert again? She had Slept the sleep of exhaustion in the softest bed with the cleanest linen she had experienced in her eight years but she knew everything the priests did could have a double meaning. They were not to be trusted!\n“Did you sleep well?” It was the priestess who had spoken first. She was a gray-haired older woman, her face framed in a white cowl with purple trim. The old eyes were watery but alert. Pale blue. The nose was an upturned stub above a narrow mouth and outjutting chin.\n“Will you speak to us?” the woman persisted. “I am Cania, your night attendant. Remember? | helped you into your bed.”\nAt least, the tone of voice was reassuring. Sheeana sat up and took a better look at these people. They were afraid! A desert child’s nose could detect the telltale pheromones. To\nSheeana, it was a simple, straightforward observation: That smell equals fear.\n“You thought you would hurt me,” she said. “Why did you do that?”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and arrogant group of women from the Scattering who have perfected sexual techniques and demand worship from their followers\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>A Tleilaxu Master who engages in a dangerous negotiation with an Honored Matre, demonstrating his cunning and strategic thinking\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sisterhood of women with advanced mental and physical abilities, often in conflict with the Honored Matres\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive and manipulative group known for their genetic engineering and Face Dancers\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet where the Honored Matres have established themselves\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANDALONG<|>GEO<|>The Tleilaxu core location where Waff plans to return\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>A historical event where humans spread out into the universe, leading to the emergence of groups like the Honored Matres\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl who awakens surrounded by priests and priestesses, showing signs of fear and distrust\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANIA<|>PERSON<|>A priestess who attends to Sheeana and tries to reassure her\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>HONORED MATRE<|>Waff negotiates with an Honored Matre, revealing her desperation and his strategic advantage<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres are compared to the Bene Gesserit but lack their melange memories<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>TLEILAXU<|>Waff is a Master of the Tleilaxu, representing their interests and strategies<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>HONORED MATRE<|>The Tleilaxu create Face Dancers to infiltrate and study the Honored Matres<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRE<|>GAMMU<|>The Honored Matres have established themselves on Gammu<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>BANDALONG<|>Waff plans to return to the Tleilaxu core at Bandalong<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>CANIA<|>Cania is Sheeana's night attendant, trying to reassure her<|>3\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PRIESTS<|>Sheeana is surrounded by priests and priestesses, showing fear and distrust<|>4\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
