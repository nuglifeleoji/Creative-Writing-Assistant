A **minstrel-warrior** by nature, Halleck is renowned for his tactical acumen, often providing security and strategic counsel to the Duke. He is deeply involved in public relations and military decisions, reflecting his dual role as both a fighter and a diplomat.  \n\nHalleck's loyalty extends beyond the Duke to **Lady Jessica**, with whom he communicates secretly using **hand signals**, underscoring his discretion and devotion. He is also deeply protective, as demonstrated when he expresses concern for a boy's safety during a **sandblast storm** and considers unconventional methods like sending a message via a **bat's voice**.  \n\nHis current status is ambiguous; some accounts suggest he may have **escaped during an attack** on House Atreides, while others indicate he is **hiding among smugglers**, possibly after capturing a **sandworm** and seeking shelter. Despite these conflicting reports, his allegiance to House Atreides remains unwavering. Known for his **use of quotations** and his dual identity as both a warrior and a bard, Halleck embodies the blend of intellect and combat prowess that defines his service to the Atreides.  \n\nIn summary, Gurney Halleck is a **skilled warrior, loyal advisor, and resourceful survivor**, whose actions—whether in battle, diplomacy, or evasion—consistently reflect his dedication to House Atreides and its members.\",11\r\n691,SABIHA,\"**Sabiha** is a young Fremen woman, the niece of Namri, trained in harsh survival skills, including knife combat. She is cautious and skeptical, yet intrigued by Leto II's words and actions. Sent to Shuloch as punishment for allowing Leto to escape, she becomes deeply entangled in the events surrounding him. Sabiha plays a key role in the Fremen plan to control Leto, monitoring him during his spice trance and witnessing his shocking transformation.  \n\nHer involvement extends beyond surveillance; she is also a caretaker, preparing food for Bes and participating in the broader narrative of visions and prophecies. At one point, she suggests that Leto may have hidden in the sand using a Fremkit, demonstrating her familiarity with Fremen tactics. However, her story takes a darker turn when she is shamed by Leto and subjected to an Isnad judgment, resulting in her being sent to lose her water—a severe Fremen punishment.  \n\nSabiha’s presence in Shuloch and her connection to the qanat underscore her significance in the unfolding events. She embodies the tension between duty and curiosity, serving as both an enforcer of Fremen discipline and a witness to Leto’s extraordinary destiny. Her multifaceted role—as a survivor, a punished outcast, and an observer of Leto’s metamorphosis—highlights her importance in the narrative.\",9\r\n677,NAMRI,\"**Namri** is a Fremen and a Zensunni Wanderer deeply involved in the events surrounding Leto II. As Sabiha's uncle, he holds a familial connection to her and is implicated in her actions, including her offense against Jacurutu. Namri plays a pivotal role in Leto's fate, initially tasked with potentially killing him as part of a Fremen judgment. He embodies both cultural loyalty and deviousness, wielding a knife during Leto's captivity and interrogation, where he references family marks and visions of Thatta.  \n\nDespite his initial intentions, Namri is swayed by Leto's words, becoming part of the group that ultimately decides Leto's survival. He interacts with Gurney Halleck, discussing Leto's safety and Sabiha's involvement, and later informs Halleck about an incoming storm and a communication blackout that prevents sending messages. Namri also participates in the spice trance process, following Jessica's instructions, further tying him to the broader narrative.  \n\nHis character represents both a threat and a test for Leto, balancing his duties as a Fremen with moments of reconsideration. Namri's actions highlight his role as a key figure in the unfolding events, bridging familial, cultural, and political tensions within the story.\",9\r\n704,SANDBLAST STORM,\"The sandblast storm is an incoming weather event that disrupts communication and poses danger to those caught outside.\"\"\",1\r\n726,TUEEK’S SIETCH,Tuek’s Sietch is a smugglers' hideaway on the inner lip of False Wall,1\r\n723,MELIDES,Melides is a sietch attendant who informs Halleck of his acceptance into the sietch,1\r\n678,JAVALUD-DIN,\"High Shield Wall location where Namri's family marks are carved\"\"\",1\r\n680,THATTA,\"City of tombs seen in a desert vision, tied to Zensunni beliefs\"\"\",1\r\n636,QANAT,\"The **Qanat** is a water channel located in the desert, specifically in the region of **Shuloch**.

Additionally, **Leto and Sabiha** stand by the qanat, using it as a place for reflection on their circumstances and the environment around them. The qanat thus functions both as a practical water source in the desert and as a symbolic setting for contemplation and movement within the story.

Additionally, it is mentioned that Sabiha was sent to **Shuloch** as a form of punishment, though the exact reasons for this disciplinary action are not specified.
