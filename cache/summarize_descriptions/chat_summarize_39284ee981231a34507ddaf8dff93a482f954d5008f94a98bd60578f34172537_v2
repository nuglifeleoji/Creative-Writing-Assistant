One notable instance of their operation includes transporting individuals such as **Duncan Idaho** to destinations like **Arrakis**.  \n\nContrary to the description suggesting the Guild Heighliner is a \"transportation organization,\" it is clarified that the **Heighliner** itself is a **spaceship**, while the **Spacing Guild** is the organization responsible for its operation. The repeated emphasis on their immense size and role in interstellar travel underscores their critical function in the galactic infrastructure.  \n\nIn summary, the **Guild Heighliner** is a gigantic, Guild-operated spacecraft enabling long-distance travel, distinct from the Spacing Guild itself, which manages these vessels and their logistics.
