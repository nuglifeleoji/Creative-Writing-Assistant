和其他娃娃摸黑赶到石圪节。润叶家里光景好，已经上了学校的大灶，除过星期六，大部分都在学校住宿，不天天受罪跑路了。他们仍然是一个班，还是同桌。他学习好，常给润叶帮助。如果考试的时候，润叶不会，他还偷偷给她看自己的答卷。要是哪个男同学敢欺负润叶，他就不怕别人瞎说他和润叶的长长短短，站出来护着润叶。一次，一个男同学在操场上故意把篮球往润叶身上扔，他过去把那家伙打得鼻子口里直淌血，让老师把他狠狠训了一顿……但是当他上完两年高小，却再不能去县城上中学了。那时石圪节还没有中学，要上初中就得到县城去。到那里去上学，对一个农民家庭来说，可不是一件容易事。再不能跑回家吃饭了，要月月交硬正粮食，还要买菜票，更不要说其它花费也大多了。而同时，弟弟少平也在村里上了学。他父亲再也供不起他了。他已经十三岁，不用父亲说，自己也知道不能去城里读书了。他对父亲说：“爸爸，我回来劳动呀。我已经上到了高小，这也不容易了，多少算有了点文化。就是以后在村里劳动，也不睁眼睛受罪了。我回来，咱们两个人劳动，一定要把少平和兰香的书供成。只要他两个有本事，能考到哪里，咱们就把他们供到哪里。哪怕他们出国留洋。咱们也挣命供他们吧！他们念成了，和我念成一样。不过，爸爸，我只是想进一回初中的考场；我要给村里村外的人证明，我不上中学，不是因为我考不上！” \n　　他父亲在他面前抱住头痛哭流涕。他第一次看见刚强的父亲在他面前流泪。他自己也哭了。是的，他将要和学校的大门永远地告别了。他多么不情愿啊！他理解父亲的痛苦——爸爸也不愿意断送他的前程……就这样，他参加了全县升初中的统一考试。在全县几千名考生中，他名列第三被录取了。他的学生生涯随着这张录取通知书的到来，也就完全终结了！尽管润叶跑到他家来，又象他上小学时一样，哭着让他到城里去报名。但这回用不着父母亲给她解释，他自己就象一个成熟的大人那样，给润叶说明他为什么不能再上学了……当润叶坐着金俊海的汽车离开村子的时候，他一个人偷偷地躲在公路上面的土圪崂里，泪流满面地看着她出了村。别了，我童年的朋友！我们将各走各的路了，我会永远记着我们过去的一切…… \n　　他从此便心平气静地开始了自己的农民生涯，并且决心要在双水村做一个出众的庄稼人。 \n　　后来，由于他的精明强悍和可怕的吃苦精神，在十八岁那年，一队的社员就一致推选他当了队长。这多年里，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
