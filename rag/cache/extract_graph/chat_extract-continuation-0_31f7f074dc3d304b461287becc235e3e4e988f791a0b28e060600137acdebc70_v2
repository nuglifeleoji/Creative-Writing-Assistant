Here, he encountered the fact that descendants of Duncan Idaho and Siona, those ancients who had served the Tyrant God Emperor, also were invisible to prophets and prescients. Not even a Guild Steersman deep in melange trance could detect such people. Siona, the accounts told him, was a true-bred Atreides and Duncan Idaho was a ghola.\nGhola?\nHe probed the library for elaborations on this peculiar word. Ghola. The library produced for him no more than bare-boned accounts: “Gholas: humans grown from a cadaver’s cells in Tleilaxu axlotl tanks.”\nAxlotl tanks?\n“A Tleilaxu device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver.”\n“Describe a ghola,” he demanded.\n“Innocent flesh devoid of its original memories. See Axlotl Tanks.”\nDuncan had learned to read the silences, the blank places in what the people of the Keep revealed to him. Revelation swept over him. He knew! Only ten and he knew!\nlam a ghola.\nLate afternoon in the library, all of the esoteric machinery around him faded into a sensory background, and a ten- year-old sat silently before a scanner hugging the knowledge to himself.\nlam a ghola!\nHe could not remember the axlotl tanks where his cells had grown into an infant. His first memories were of Geasa picking him up from his cradle, the alert interest in those adult eyes that had so soon faded into wary lidding.\nIt was as though the information so grudgingly supplied him by the Keep’s people and records had at last defined a central shape: himself.\n“Tell me about the Bene Tleilax,” he demanded of the library.\n“They are a people self-divided into Face Dancers and Masters. Face Dancers are mules, sterile and submissive to the Masters.”\nWhy did they do this to me?\nThe information machines of the library were suddenly alien and dangerous. He was afraid, not that his questions might meet more blank walls, but that he would receive answers.\nWhy am I so important to Schwangyu and the others?\nHe felt that they had wronged him, even Miles Teg and Patrin. Why was it right to take the cells of a human and produce a ghola?\nHe asked the next question with great hesitation. “Can a ghola ever remember who he was?”\n“It can be done.”\n“How?”\n“The psychological identity of ghola to original pre-sets certain responses, which can be ignited by trauma.”\nNo answer at all!\n“But how?”\nSchwangyu intruded at this point, arriving at the library unannounced. So something about his questions had been set to alert her!\n“All will be made clear to you in time,” she said.\nShe talked down to him! He sensed the injustice in it, the lack of truthfulness. Something within him said he carried more human wisdom in his unawakened self than the ones who presumed themselves so superior. His hatred of Schwangyu reached a new intensity. She was the personification of all who tantalized him and frustrated his questions.\nNow, though, his imagination was on fire. He would recapture his original memories! He felt the truth of this. He would remember his parents, his family, his friends... his enemies.\nHe demanded it of Schwangyu: “Did you produce me because of my enemies?”\n“You have already learned silence, child,” she said. “Rely on that knowledge.”\nVery well. That’s how I will fight you, damned Schwangyu. / will be silent and I will learn. | won’t show you how | really feel.\n“You know,” she said, “I think we're raising a stoic.”\nShe patronized him! He would not be patronized. He would fight them all with silence and watchfulness. Duncan ran from the library and huddled in his room.\nIn the following months, many things confirmed that he was a ghola. Even a child knew when things around him were extraordinary. He saw other children occasionally beyond the walls, walking along the perimeter road, laughing and calling. He found accounts of children in the library. Adults did not come to those children and engage\nthem in rigorous training of the sort imposed on him. Other children did not have a Reverend Mother Schwangyu to order every smallest aspect of their lives.\nHis discovery precipitated another change in Duncan’s life. Luran Geasa was called away from him and did not return.\nShe was not supposed to let me know about gholas.\nThe truth was somewhat more complex, as Schwangyu explained to Lucilla on the observation parapet the day of Lucilla’s arrival.\n“We knew the inevitable moment would come. He would learn about gholas and ask the pointed questions.”\n“It was high time a Reverend Mother took over his everyday education. Geasa may have been a mistake.”\n“Are you questioning my judgment?” Schwangyu Snapped.\n“Is your judgment so perfect that it may never be questioned?” In Lucilla’s soft contralto, the question had the impact of a slap.\nSchwangyu remained silent for almost a minute. Presently, she said: “Geasa thought the ghola was an endearing child. She cried and said she would miss him.”\n“Wasn't she warned about that?”\n“Geasa did not have our training.”\n“So you replaced her with Tamalane at that time. | do not know Tamalane but | presume she is quite old.”\n“Quite.”\n“What was his reaction to the removal of Geasa?”\n“He asked where she had gone. We did not answer.”\n“How did Tamalane fare?”\n“On his third day with her, he told her very calmly: ‘I hate you. Is that what I’m supposed to do?’”\n“So quickly!”\n“Right now, he’s watching you and thinking: | hate Schwangyu. Will | have to hate this new one? But he is also\nthinking that you are not like the other old witches. You’re young. He will know that this must be important.”\nHumans live best when each has his place to stand, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things and what he may achieve. Destroy the place and you destroy the person.\n—BENE GESSERIT TEACHING\nMI iles Teg had not wanted the Gammu assignment. Weapons master to a ghola-child? Even such a ghola- child as this one, with all of the history woven around him. It was an unwanted intrusion into Teg’s well-ordered retirement.\nBut he had lived all of that life as a Military Mentat under the will of the Bene Gesserit and could not compute an act of disobedience.\nQuis custodiet ipsos custodiet?\nWho shall guard the guardians? Who shall see that the guardians commit no offenses?\nThis was a question that Teg had considered carefully on many occasions. It formed one of the basic tenets of his loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. Whatever else you might say about the Sisterhood, they displayed an admirable constancy of purpose.\nMoral purpose, Teg labeled it.\nThe Bene Gesserit moral purpose agreed completely with Teg’s principles. That those principles were Bene Gesserit- conditioned in him did not enter into the question. Rational thought, especially Mentat rationality, could make no other judgment.\nTeg boiled it down to an essence: If only one person followed such guiding principles, this was a better universe. It was never a question of justice. Justice required resort to law and that could be a fickle mistress, subject always to\nthe whims and prejudices of those who administered the laws. No, it was a question of fairness, a concept that went much deeper. The people upon whom judgment was passed must feel the fairness of it.\nTo Teg, statements such as “the letter of the law must be observed” were dangerous to his guiding principles. Being fair required agreement, predictable constancy and, above all else, loyalty upward and downward in the hierarchy. Leadership guided by such principles required no outside controls. You did your duty because it was right. And you did not obey because that was predictably correct. You did it because the rightness was a thing of this moment. Prediction and prescience had nothing whatsoever to do with it.\nTeg knew the Atreides reputation for reliable prescience, but gnomic utterances had no place in his universe. You took the universe as you found it and applied your principles where you could. Absolute commands in the hierarchy were always obeyed. Not that Taraza had made it a question of absolute command, but the implications were there.\n“You are the perfect person for this task.”\nHe had lived a long life with many high points and he was retired with honor. Teg knew he was old, slow and with all the defects of age waiting just at the edges of his awareness, but the call to duty quickened him even while he was forced to put down the wish to say “No.”\nThe assignment had come from Taraza personally. The powerful senior of all (including the Missionaria Protectiva) singled him out. Not just a Reverend Mother but the Reverend Mother Superior.\nTaraza came to his retirement sanctuary on Lernaeus. It honored him for her to do this and he knew it. She appeared at his gate unannounced, accompanied only by two acolyte servers and a small guard force, some of whose faces he recognized. Teg had trained them himself. The time of her arrival was interesting. Morning, shortly after his breakfast.\nShe knew the patterns of his life and certainly knew that he was most alert at this hour. So she wanted him awake and at his fullest capabilities.\nPatrin, Teg’s old batman, brought Taraza into the east wing sitting room, a small and elegant setting with only solid furniture in it. Teg’s dislike of chairdogs and other living furniture was well known. Patrin had a sour look on his face as he ushered the black-robed Mother Superior into the room. Teg recognized the look immediately. Patrin’s long, pale face with its many age wrinkles might appear an unmoved mask to others, but Teg was alert to the deepened wrinkles beside the man’s mouth, the set stare in the old eyes. So Taraza had said something on the way in here that had disturbed Patrin.\nTall sliding doors of heavy plaz framed the room’s eastward view down a long sloping lawn to trees beside the river. Taraza paused just inside the room to admire the view.\nWithout being told, Teg touched a button. Curtains slid across the view and glowglobes came alight. Teg’s action told Taraza he had computed a need for privacy. He emphasized this by ordering Patrin: “Please see that we are not disturbed.”\n“The orders for the South Farm, sir,” Patrin ventured.\n“Please see to that yourself. You and Firus know what | want.”\nPatrin closed the door a little too sharply as he left, a tiny Signal but it spoke much to Teg.\nTaraza moved a pace into the room and examined it. “Lime green,” she said. “One of my favorite colors. Your mother had a fine eye.”\nTeg warmed to the remark. He had a deep affection for this building and this land. His family had been here only three generations but their mark was on the place. His mother’s touches had not really been changed in many rooms.\n“It’s safe to love land and places,” Teg said.\n“| particularly liked the burnt orange carpets in the hall and the stained glass fanlight over the entry door,” Taraza said. “That fanlight is a real antique, | am sure.”\n“You did not come here to talk about interior decoration,”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola, a human grown from a cadaver's cells in Tleilaxu axlotl tanks, and a key figure in the Bene Gesserit's plans\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a true-bred Atreides, descendant of the Tyrant God Emperor, and invisible to prescient minds\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Reverend Mother Schwangyu oversees Duncan Idaho's training and education, often frustrating his quest for knowledge\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>A young Reverend Mother assigned to Duncan's education, replacing Geasa\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LURAN GEASA<|>PERSON<|>Geasa was Duncan's initial caretaker, removed after he learned about gholas\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>An older Reverend Mother who replaced Geasa in Duncan's upbringing\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>A retired Military Mentat assigned as weapons master to Duncan Idaho\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Teg's loyal batman, who assists him in retirement\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Reverend Mother Superior who assigns Miles Teg to oversee Duncan Idaho\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive group divided into Face Dancers and Masters, creators of gholas\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The powerful Sisterhood manipulating events, including Duncan Idaho's upbringing\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AXLOTL TANKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tleilaxu devices used to grow gholas from cadaver cells\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Prison where Samuel Namara was held in Tiruzia\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LEARNAEUS<|>GEO<|>Teg's retirement sanctuary where Taraza visits him\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GHOLA CREATION<|>EVENT<|>The process of recreating a human from cadaver cells in axlotl tanks\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HOSTAGE EXCHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Negotiated release of Aurelians held in Firuzabad\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>Duncan is a ghola created by the Bene Tleilax<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Bene Gesserit control Duncan's upbringing and training<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SCHWANGYU<|>Schwangyu supervises Duncan's education and frustrates his quest for knowledge<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MILES TEG<|>Teg is assigned as Duncan's weapons master<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>TARAZA<|>Taraza personally assigns Teg to oversee Duncan<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>LUCILA<|>Lucilla replaces Schwangyu in Duncan's education<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LURAN GEASA<|>Geasa was Duncan's initial caretaker before being removed<|>4\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TAMALANE<|>Tamalane replaces Geasa in Duncan's upbringing<|>3\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SIONA<|>Both are descendants linked to the Tyrant God Emperor and invisible to prescience<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>AXLOTL TANKS<|>The Bene Tleilax use axlotl tanks to create gholas<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PATRIN<|>Patrin serves as Teg's loyal batman<|>7\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
