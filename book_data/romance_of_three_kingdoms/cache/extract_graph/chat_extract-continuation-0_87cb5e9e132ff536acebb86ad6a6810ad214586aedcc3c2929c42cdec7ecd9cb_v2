玄德与孔明亲赴桂阳。云迎接入城，推赵范于阶下。孔明问之，范备言以嫂许嫁之事。孔明谓云曰：“此亦美事，公何如此？”云曰：“赵范既与某结为兄弟，今若娶其嫂，惹人唾骂，一也；其妇再嫁，使失大节，二也；赵范初降，其心难测，三也。主公新定江汉，枕席未安，云安敢以一妇人而废主公之大事？”玄德曰：“今日大事已定，与汝娶之，若何？”云吾：“天下女子不少，但恐名誉不立，何患无妻子乎？”玄德曰：“子龙真丈夫也！”遂释赵范，仍令为桂阳太守，重赏赵云。张飞大叫曰：“偏子龙干得功！偏我是无用之人！只拨三千军与我去取武陵郡，活捉太守金旋来献！”孔明大喜曰：“翼德要去不妨，但要依一件事。”正是：军师决胜多奇策，将士争先立战功。未知孔明说出那一件事来，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第五十三回
