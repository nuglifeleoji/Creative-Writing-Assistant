席上，正中坐着田福堂，他两边坐着公社文书刘根民和队里的副书记金俊山；接下来金俊武、田海民、田福高等人依次围成一圈。孙玉亭虽说也应该坐在这一席上，但他是自家人，这时候得充当“工作人员”，他也做不了什么，就帮兰香在灶火圪崂里烧火。贺凤英参观大寨前几天也回来了，现在正和她嫂子、金波他妈、兰花一起在锅灶上忙着。 \n　　在后炕头亲戚的这一桌上，还坐着一位诸位已熟悉的人物田二。在这样的场所，总是少不了他的。村里不论谁家的红、白喜事，田二都不请自到。在这种时候，别说田二是本村人讨吃上门，就是来个外地的叫化子，事主家除不讨厌，反而乐意接待。结婚是个喜事，还盼来个叫化子哩！按乡俗论，有叫化子参加红白喜事，是吉利的征兆——此奥妙说法有何根据？恐怕已无从查考。 \n　　王满银还没等坐席，就已经自己招呼着自己把肚子撑圆了。现在他正忙着往炕上端盘子。他吃高兴了，象耍杂耍似的用五个手指头顶着一大红油漆盘子炒菜，唱歌一般吆喝着在人群中穿行。做席面菜的是金俊文——他不光杀猪是一把好手，做席面“碗子”在村里也是第一流的。金俊文把八碗主要以肥肉为主的菜放在红油漆盘里，王满银就吼叫着端起来往炕桌上送去。 \n　　少安妈和金波妈在锅上把油糕和白面馍，分别拾到几个盘子里，兰花和贺凤英两个人一前一后往席面上送。炕上的两桌人，吃着，说着，笑着，一个个脸上都汗津津的。少安在干部席上劝酒；而他的秀莲因为这里没地方，此刻正由金秀陪着坐在金家湾那面——等这面坐完席后，她再回来……这顿饭一直从中午吃到晚上。 \n　　当少安和秀莲终于回到一队饲养院的新房后，村里的一些年轻人又混闹了半晚上，这个婚礼才算全部结束了……第二天临近中午，少安和秀莲正准备回家吃饭，书记田福堂突然来到饲养院他们的新房。他拿来两块杭州出的锦花缎被面，说是润叶今天上午捎回来的，让他把这礼物转送给新婚的少安夫妇。 \n　　田福堂把润叶的礼物放下，就告辞走了。 \n　　秀莲马上奇怪地问丈夫：“润叶是个什么人，怎给咱送这么重的礼物？” \n　　少安尽量轻淡地说：“她是刚来的田大叔的女儿，她和我小时候同过学……” \n　　“肯定和你相好过！要不送这么贵的东西？”秀�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂 is a prominent
