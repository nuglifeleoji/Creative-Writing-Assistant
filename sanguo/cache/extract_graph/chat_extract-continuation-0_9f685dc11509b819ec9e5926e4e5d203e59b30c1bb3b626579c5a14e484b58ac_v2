耶！”忠怒曰：“竖子欺吾年老！吾手中宝刀却不老！”遂拍马向前与郃决战。二马相交，约战二十余合，忽然背后喊声起：原来是严颜从小路抄在张郃军后。两军夹攻，张郃大败。连夜赶去，张郃兵退八九十里。黄忠、严颜收兵入寨，俱各按兵不动。\n\n    曹洪听知张郃输了一阵，又欲见罪。郭淮曰：“张郃被迫，必投西蜀；今可遣将助之，就如监临，使不生外心。”曹洪从之，即遣夏侯惇之侄夏侯尚并降将韩玄之弟韩浩，二人引五千兵，前来助战。二将即时起行。到张郃寨中，问及军情，郃言：“老将黄忠，甚是英雄，更有严颜相助，不可轻敌。”韩浩曰：“我在长沙知此老贼利害。他和魏延献了城池，害吾亲兄，今既相遇，必当报仇！”遂与夏侯尚引新军离寨前进。原来黄忠连日哨探，已知路径。严颜曰：“此去有山，名天荡山，山中乃是曹操屯粮积草之地。若取得那个去处，断其粮草，汉中可得也。”忠曰：“将军之言，正合吾意。可与吾如此如此。”严颜依计，自领一枝军去了。\n\n    却说黄忠听知夏侯尚、韩浩来，遂引军马出营。韩浩在阵前，大骂黄忠：“无义老贼！”拍马挺枪，来取黄忠。夏侯尚便出夹攻。黄忠力战二将，各斗十余合，黄忠败走。二将赶二十余里，夺了黄忠寨。忠又草创一营。次日，夏侯尚、韩浩赶来，忠又出阵，战数合，又败走。二将又赶二十余里，夺了黄忠营寨，唤张郃守后寨。郃来前寨谏曰：“黄忠连退二日，于中必有诡计。”夏侯尚叱张郃曰：“你如此胆怯，可知屡次战败！今再休多言，看吾二人建功！”张郃羞赧而退。次日，二将又战，黄忠又败退二十里；二将迤逦赶上。次日，二将兵出，黄忠望风而走，连败数阵，直退在关上。二将扣关下寨，黄忠坚守不出。孟达暗暗发书，申报玄德，说：“黄忠连输数阵，现今退在关上。”玄德慌问孔明。孔明曰：“此乃老将骄兵之计也。”赵云等不信。\n\n    玄德差刘封来关上接应黄忠。忠与封相见，问刘封曰：“小将军来助战何意？”封曰：“父亲得知将军数败，故差某来。”忠笑曰：“此老夫骄兵之计也。看今夜一阵，可尽复诸营，夺其粮食马匹。此是借寨与彼屯辎重耳。今夜留霍峻守关，孟将军可与我搬粮草夺马匹，小将军看我破敌！”\n\n    是夜二更，忠\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
