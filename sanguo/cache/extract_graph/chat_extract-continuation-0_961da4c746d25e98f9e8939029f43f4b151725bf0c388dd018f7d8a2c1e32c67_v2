策。张郃曰：“吾愿引一军去守雍、郿，以拒蜀兵。”懿曰：“吾前军不能独当孔明之众，而又分兵为前后，非胜算也。不如留兵守上邽，余众悉往祁山。公肯为先锋否？”郃大喜曰：“吾素怀忠义，欲尽心报国，惜未遇知己；今都督肯委重任，虽万死不辞！”于是司马懿令张郃为先锋，总督大军。又令郭淮守陇西诸郡，其余众将各分道而进。\n\n    前军哨马报说：孔明率大军望祁山进发，前部先锋王平、张嶷，径出陈仓，过剑阁，由散关望斜谷而来。司马懿谓张郃曰：“今孔明长驱大进认识，“我们对任何一个命题都可以说出相反的命题来”。主，必将割陇西小麦，以资军粮。汝可结营守祁山，吾与郭淮巡略天水诸郡，以防蜀兵割麦。”郃领诺，遂引四万兵守祁山。懿引大军望陇西而去。\n\n    却说孔明兵至祁山，安营已毕，见渭滨有魏军提备，乃谓诸将曰：“此必是司马懿也。即今营中乏粮，屡遣人催并李严运米应付，却只是不到。吾料陇上麦熟，可密引兵割之。”于是留王平、张嶷、吴班、吴懿四将守祁山营，孔明自引姜维、魏延等诸将，前到卤城。卤城太守素知孔明，慌忙开城出降。孔明抚慰毕，问曰：“此时何处麦熟？”太守告曰：“陇上麦已熟。”孔明乃留张翼、马忠守卤城，自引诸将并三军望陇上而来。前军回报说：“司马懿引兵在此。”孔明惊曰：“此人预知吾来割麦也！”即沐浴更衣，推过一般三辆四轮车来，车上皆要一样妆饰。此车乃孔明在蜀中预先造下的。\n\n    当下令姜维引一千军护车，五百军擂鼓，伏在上邽之后；马岱在左，魏延在右，亦各引一千军护车，五百军擂鼓。每一辆车，用二十四人，皂衣跣足，披发仗剑，手执七星皂旙，在左右推车。三人各受计，引兵推车而去。孔明又令三万军皆执镰刀、驮绳，伺候割麦。却选二十四个精壮之士，各穿皂衣，披发跣足，仗剑簇拥四轮车，为推车使者。令关兴结束做天蓬模样，手执七星皂幡，步行于车前。孔明端坐于上，望魏营而来。哨探军见之大惊，不知是人是鬼，火速报知司马懿。懿自出营视之，只见孔明簪冠鹤氅，手摇羽扇，端坐于四轮车上；左右二十四人，披发仗剑；前面一人，手执皂幡，隐隐似天神一般。\n######################\nOutput:",
