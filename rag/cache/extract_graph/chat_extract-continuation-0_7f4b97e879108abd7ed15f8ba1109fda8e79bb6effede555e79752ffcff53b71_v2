A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother sprawled there in shigawire bindings. The captive made no attempt to struggle. Shigawire was excellent for this purpose. Cut her arms off, it would!\nThe chamber where she sat suited Great Honored Matre as much for its dimensions as for the fact that it had been taken from others. Three hundred meters square, it had been designed for convocations of Guild Navigators here on Junction, each Navigator in a monstrous tank. The captive on that yellow floor was a mote in immensity.\nThis weakling took too much joy in revealing what her so- called Superior named me!\nBut it still was a lovely morning, Great Honored Matre thought. Except that no tortures or mental probes worked on these witches. How could you torture someone who might choose to die at any moment? And did! They had ways of suppressing pain, too. Very wily, these primitives.\nShe’s loaded with shere, too! A body infused with that damnable drug deteriorated beyond the reach of probes before it could be examined adequately.\nGreat Honored Matre signaled an aide. That one nudged the sprawled Reverend Mother with a foot and, at a further signal, eased the shigawire bindings to allow minimal movement.\n“What is your name, child?” Great Honored Matre asked. Her voice rasped hoarsely with age and false bonhomie.\n“lam called Sabanda.” Clear young voice, still untouched by the pain of probings.\n“Would you like to watch us capture a weak male and enslave him?” Great Honored Matre asked.\nSabanda knew the proper response to this. They had been warned. “I will die first.” She said it calmly, staring up at that ancient face the color of a dried root left too long in the sun. Those odd orange flecks in the crone’s eyes. A sign of anger, Proctors had told her.\nA loosely hung red-gold robe with black dragon figures down its open face and red leotards beneath it only emphasized the scrawny figure they covered.\nGreat Honored Matre did not change expression even with a recurrent thought about these witches: Damn them! “What was your task on that dirty little planet where we took you?”\n“A teacher of the young.”\n“I’m afraid we didn’t leave any of your young alive.” Now why does she smile? To offend me! That’s why!\n“Did you teach your young ones to worship the witch, Sheeana?” Great Honored Matre asked.\n“Why should | teach them to worship a Sister? Sheeana would not like that.”\n“Would not... Are you saying she has come back to life and you know her?”\n“Is it only the living we know?”\nHow clear and fearless the voice of this young witch. They had remarkable self-control, but even that could not save them. Odd, though, how this cult of Sheeana persisted. It would have to be rooted out, of course, destroyed the way the witches themselves were being destroyed.\nGreat Honored Matre lifted the little finger of her right hand. A waiting aide approached the captive with an injection. Perhaps this new drug would free a witch’s tongue, perhaps not. No matter.\nSabanda grimaced when the injector touched her neck. In seconds she was dead. Servants carried the body away. It would be fed to captive Futars. Not that Futars were much use. Wouldn’t breed in captivity, wouldn’t obey the most ordinary commands. Sullen, waiting.\n“Where Handlers?” one might ask. Or other useless words would spill from their humanoid mouths. Still, Futars provided some pleasures. Captivity also demonstrated they were vulnerable. Just as these primitive witches were. We’// find the witches’ hiding place. It’s only a matter of time.\nThe person who takes the banal and ordinary and illuminates it in a new way can terrify. We do not want our ideas changed. We feel threatened by such demands. “I already know the important things!” we say. Then Changer comes and throws our old ideas away.\n—THE ZENSUFI MASTER\nM iles Teg enjoyed playing in the orchards around Central. Odrade had first taken him here when he could just toddle. One of his earliest memories: hardly more than two years old and already aware he was a ghola, though he did not understand the word’s full meaning.\n“You are a special child,” Odrade said. “We made you from cells taken from a very old man.”\nAlthough he was a precocious child and her words had a vaguely disturbing sound, he was more interested then in running through tall summer grass beneath the trees.\nLater, he added other orchard days to that first one, accumulating as well impressions about Odrade and the others who taught him. He recognized quite early that Odrade enjoyed the excursions as much as he did.\nOne afternoon in his fourth year, he told her: “Spring is my favorite time.”\n“Mine, too.”\nWhen he was seven and already showing the mental brilliance coupled to holographic memory that had caused the Sisterhood to place such heavy responsibilities on his previous incarnation, he suddenly saw the orchards as a place touching something deep inside him.\nThis was his first real awareness that he carried memories he could not recall. Deeply disturbed, he turned to Odrade,\nwho stood outlined in light against the afternoon sun, and said: “There are things | can’t remember!”\n“One day you will remember,” she said.\nHe could not see her face against the bright light and her words came from a great shadow place, as much within him as from Odrade.\nThat year he began studying the life of the Bashar Miles Teg, whose cells had started his new life. Odrade had explained some of this to him, holding up her fingernails. “l took tiny scrapings from his neck—cells of his skin and they held all we needed to bring you to life.”\nThere was something intense about the orchards that year, fruit larger and heavier, bees almost frenetic.\n“It’s because of the desert growing larger down there in the south,” Odrade said. She held his hand as they walked through a dew-fresh morning beneath burgeoning apple trees.\nTeg stared southward through the trees, momentarily mesmerized by leaf-dappled sunlight. He had studied about the desert, and he thought he could feel the weight of it on this place.\n“Trees can sense their end approaching,” Odrade said. “Life breeds more intensely when threatened.”\n“The air is very dry,” he said. “That must be the desert.”\n“Notice how some of the leaves have gone brown and curled at the edges? We've had to irrigate heavily this year.”\nHe liked it that she seldom talked down to him. It was mostly one person to another. He saw curled brown on leaves. The desert did that.\nDeep in the orchard, they listened quietly for a time to birds and insects. Bees working the clover of a nearby pasture came to investigate but he was pheromone-marked, as were all who walked freely on Chapterhouse. They buzzed past him, sensed identifiers and went away about their business with blossoms.\nApples. Odrade pointed westward. Peaches. His attention went where she directed. And yes, there were the cherries east of them beyond the pasture. He saw resin ribbing on the limbs.\nSeeds and young shoots had been brought here on the Original no-ships some fifteen hundred years ago, she said, and had been planted with loving care.\nTeg visualized hands grubbing in dirt, gently patting earth around young shoots, careful irrigation, the fencing to confine the cattle to wild pastures around the first Chapterhouse plantations and buildings.\nBy this time he already had begun learning about the giant sandworm the Sisterhood had spirited from Rakis. Death of that worm had produced creatures called sandtrout. Sandtrout were why the desert grew. Some of this history touched accounts of his previous incarnation—a man they called “The Bashar.” A great soldier who had died when terrible women called Honored Matres destroyed Rakis.\nTeg found such studies both fascinating and troubling. He sensed gaps in himself, places where memories ought to be. The gaps called out to him in dreams. And sometimes when he fell into reverie, faces appeared before him. He could almost hear words. Then there were times he knew the names of things before anyone told him. Especially names of weapons.\nMomentous things grew in his awareness. This entire planet would become desert, a change started because Honored Matres wanted to kill these Bene Gesserit who raised him.\nReverend Mothers who controlled his life often awed him —black-robed, austere, those blue-in-blue eyes with absolutely no white. The spice did that, they said.\nOnly Odrade showed him anything he took for real affection and Odrade was someone very important. Everyone called her Mother Superior and that was what she\ntold him to call her except when they were alone in the orchards. Then he could call her Mother.\nOn a morning walk near harvest time in his ninth year, just over the third rise in the apple orchards north of Central, they came on a shallow depression free of trees and lush with many different plants. Odrade put a hand on his shoulder and held him where they could admire black stepping-stones in a meander track through massed greenery and tiny flowers. She was in an odd mood. He heard it in her voice.\n“Ownership is an interesting question,” she said. “Do we own this planet or does it own us?”\n“I like the smells here,” he said.\nShe released him and urged him gently ahead of her. “We planted for the nose here, Miles. Aromatic herbs. Study them carefully and look them up when you get back to the library. Oh, do step on them!” when he started to avoid a plant runner in his path.\nHe placed his right foot firmly on green tendrils and inhaled pungent odors.\n“They were made to be walked on and give up their savor,” Odrade said. “Proctors have been teaching you how to deal with nostalgia. Have they told you nostalgia often is driven by the sense of smell?”\n“Yes, Mother.” Turning to look back at where he had stepped, he said: “That’s rosemary.”\n“How do you know?” Very intense.\nHe shrugged. “I just know.”\n“That may be an original memory.” She sounded pleased.\nAs they continued their walk in the aromatic hollow, Odrade’s voice once more became pensive. “Each planet has its own character where we draw patterns of Old Earth. Sometimes, it’s only a faint sketch, but here we have succeeded.”\nShe knelt and pulled a twig from an acid-green plant. Crushing it in her fingers, she held it to his nose. “Sage.”\nShe was right but he could not say how he knew.\n“I’ve smelled that in food. Is that like melange?”\n“It improves flavor but won’t change consciousness.” She stood and looked down at him from her full height. “Mark this place well, Miles. Our ancestral worlds are gone, but here we have recaptured part of our origins.”\nHe sensed she was teaching him something important. He asked Odrade: “Why did you wonder if this planet owned us?”\n“My Sisterhood believes we are stewards of the land. Do you know about stewards?”\n“Like Roitiro, my friend Yorgi’s father. Yorgi says his oldest sister will be steward of their plantation someday.”\n“Correct. We have a longer residence on some planets than any other people we know of but we are only stewards.”\n“If you don’t own Chapterhouse, who does?”\n“Perhaps nobody.
