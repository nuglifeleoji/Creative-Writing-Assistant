\n　　本来润叶打算当天晚上再来，但黑天半夜出门，家里人会不放心的。再说，晚上少安一家人都回来了，他们没办法说话。当然，她还不敢晚上把少安约到野场地里去——万一叫村里人看见，风言风雨传播开来，对两个家庭都不好。还是中午好！少安家没什么人，他们可以在他家的院子里情愿说啥就说啥呢！ \n　　第二天中午，她赶忙兴致勃勃地又去了少安家。在上他们家那个小土坡时，她心儿狂跳，气喘嘘嘘，甚至站住等平静了一些才进了院子。 \n　　叫她丧气的是，少安还没有回来！ \n　　她寻思：少安是队长，要安排生产，可能会晚回来一点，她应该耐心等一等。 \n　　少安妈也很急，对她说：“昨晚上我给少安说过好几遍哩，说你让他无论如何今中午回来一趟，有要紧事……”“那他当时答应了没？”她急切地问。 \n　　“他‘嗯’了一声……” \n　　唉！这“嗯”了一声，是答应回来哩，还是说只表示他知道了这件事，而回不回来还不能肯定呢？ \n　　润叶坐在大婶家的前炕边上，一边候少安一边胡思乱想。 \n　　直等到庄稼人吃了午饭的时光，少安还是没有回来！ \n　　润叶已经在炕边上坐不住了，溜下来在少安家的脚地上走来走去，佯装看墙上镜框里的几张照片，但耳朵高度灵敏地捕捉着门外的响动。 \n　　少安妈也急得过一会就到院子里张望一回，嘴里唠叨着一些埋怨儿子的话。真是的！让这个体面人家的女娃娃跑了两回不算，还又等了这么长时间了……少安妈看午饭时分过了好长时间，儿子还不回来，就只好对焦急的润叶说：“看来他不回来了，谁知道这死小子让什么事耽搁住了！你有什么事，能不能给我说一下，让我给他转话？” \n　　润叶的脸红了。她说：“大婶，他没回来就算了。也没什么大事。等我再回村里时给他说……” \n　　她只好又离开少安家，怏怏不快地回到自己家里——她得起身回县城了。 \n　　下午，父母亲把她送上过路的公共车。当汽车经过少安家院子下边的时候，她的眼泪忍不住在眼睛里旋转起来。她感到一种说不出的委屈。她怀揣一颗热腾腾的心，扑回村子来，准备交给她心爱的人，结果却连他的面也没有见上。她想不通少安哥为什么中午不回来见见她？他应该知道她回来找他是为了什么！ \n　　他为什么不理她呢？ \n　　当回到学校，慢慢静下来细盘算的时候，她又猜想：是不是那天中午少安的确山里有事不能回来？这完全有可能！他是队长，管的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少安<|>PERSON<|>少安 is a team leader who
