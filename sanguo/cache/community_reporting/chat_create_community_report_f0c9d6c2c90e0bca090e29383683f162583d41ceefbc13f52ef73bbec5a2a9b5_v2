Initially, he is recognized as a military commander serving under Liu Bei, where he played a significant role in strategic discussions and military planning. His involvement in these discussions highlights his importance in the military hierarchy and his contributions to Liu Bei's campaigns.\n\nHowever, 刘璝's allegiances appear to be conflicted, as he is also noted for opposing Liu Bei's forces. He was actively involved in the defense of 雒城, indicating that he was a key player in the military confrontations of the time. This duality in his role suggests that 刘璝 navigated a complex political landscape, where he was both a supporter and an adversary of Liu Bei at different points.\n\nIn the wake of 邓贤's defeat, 刘璝 sought assistance from 成都, demonstrating his proactive approach to military challenges and his desire to bolster defenses in the face of adversity. His collaboration with 吴懿 in the defense of the city further emphasizes his commitment to protecting his territory and his strategic alliances during critical moments.\n\nAdditionally, 刘璝's political maneuvers extend beyond military engagements. He served as a minister under 季玉 and expressed discontent with his superior, which led him to become involved in a conspiracy against 季玉. This aspect of his character reveals a more intricate side to 刘璝, showcasing his ambitions and willingness to engage in political intrigue.\n\nIn summary, 刘璝 is portrayed as a military leader with a dual role, serving both Liu Bei and opposing him at different times.

This aspect underscores the ongoing conflicts surrounding the city and its role as a focal point in military operations.
