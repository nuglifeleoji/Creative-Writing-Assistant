\n　　哭咽河两岸马上就要开始炸山了！人们匆忙地丢下饭碗，跑出了自己的家门，似乎要经历一生中一次非凡的事件。哭咽河的沟道已经封锁了。除过孙玉亭带领的爆破组外，村里的大人娃娃一律不准进沟。学校以及处于危险区的居民都被撤到了安全地带——其中有些人不断地向冥冥之中的上苍祷告，不要把自己的窑洞震塌！ \n　　田海民带着村里的几个民兵，用学生娃的红领巾扎了几面小红旗，在哭咽河的小桥附近站岗堵人。其实也没人敢进沟去为看热闹而冒生命危险。人们都远远地站在适当的地方，等待那天摇地动的一刻。所有的村民都莫名地感到惶惶不安。这一天西北风刮得正凶，天地间灰漠漠一片混沌。乌鸦落在庙坪光秃秃的枣村上，哇哇地叫唤着，听起来叫人不由得毛骨悚然。此时此刻，空气中似乎能嗅到一种不祥的气息。有些老者论证，这种黄风斗阵天气，往往会出不吉利的凶险事；记得当年斯大林逝世时，就是这种天气……这时候，孙少安正在大队部院子里检查抽水机的马达，以便大爆炸后冲土垫坝基。正在他心不在焉地摸揣机器的时候，他弟少平突然紧张地跑来叫他，说秀莲肚子疼得很厉害，大概要临产了！ \n　　孙少安一听这情况，不顾一切地丢下手中的活，立刻和弟弟一同往家里跑去，半路上，他叫少平赶快去拉一辆队里的架子车回来，好把秀莲送到石圪节医院去。 \n　　少安一口气跑回家后，见他的秀莲正满头大汗在炕上打滚叫喊。 \n　　他立刻叫母亲准备东西，赶紧去石圪节医院！ \n　　但他妈不同意。她平静地对儿子说，说自己完全可以给儿媳妇接生。少安看见，他妈已经从炉灶里挖了许多炉灰，放在了炕上的簸箕里。 \n　　少安生气地说：“这太不卫生了！万一有个三长两短，自家怎么能处理了？” \n　　他妈也生气地说：“你们还不是你奶奶帮我就在这土炕上生养的！生个孩子跑到医院里去干什么？真是的！” \n　　少安多少是个有些文化的人，他不同意由他母亲给秀莲接生，坚持要到石圪节医院去。在和母亲争辩的时候，他已经动手收拾起了东西。母亲一看拗不过儿子，也赶忙帮他收拾开了。 \n　　这时候，少安他奶怎么也不明白他们为什么胡乱拉东西，而把主要的事搁在一边不管？赶快�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>双水村<|>GEO<|>双水村 is a village experiencing a
