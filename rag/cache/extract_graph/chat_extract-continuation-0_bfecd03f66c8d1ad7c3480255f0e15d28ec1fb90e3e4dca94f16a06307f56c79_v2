Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber.\n“Reverend Mother?”\nA woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgar’s wives.\n“What is it, Tharthar?”\n“There is trouble, Reverend Mother.”\nJessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. “Paul...” she gasped.\nTharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at Tharthar—a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars.\n“What is it?” Jessica demanded.\n“There is word from the sand,” Tharthar said. “Usul meets the maker for his test...it is today. The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider by nightfall. The young men are banding for a razzia. They will raid in the north and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then. They say they will force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.”\nGathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely—these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The /ittle raids, the certain raids—these are no longer enough now that Paul and | have trained them. They feel their power. They want to fight.\nTharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.\nWe know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but there’s the core of our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long\ncan do us. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting’s prolonged.\n“The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be afraid,” Tharthar said.\nShe lowered her gaze.\n“So that’s the way of it,” Jessica muttered. And she thought: Well I saw it coming. As did Stilgar.\nAgain, Tharthar cleared her throat. “Even my brother, Shoab, says it,” she said. “They will leave Usul no choice.”\nThen it has come, Jessica thought. And Paul will have to handle it himself. The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.\nAlia freed her hand from her mother’s, said: “I will go with Tharthar and listen to the young men. Perhaps there Is a way.”\nJessica met Tharthar’s gaze, but spoke to Alia: “Go, then. And report to me as soon as you can.”\n“We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother,” Tharthar said.\n“We do not want it,” Jessica agreed. “The tribe needs a//its strength.” She glanced at Harah. “Will you go with them?”\nHarah answered the unspoken part of the question: “Tharthar will allow no harm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to share the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and |.” Harah looked up at Tharthar, back to Jessica. “We have an understanding.”\nTharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: “We must hurry. The young men are leaving.”\nThey pressed through the hangings, the child’s hand in the small woman's hand, but the child seemed to be leading.\n“If Paul-Muad’Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe,” Harah said. “Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed.”\n“Times have changed for you, as well,” Jessica Said.\n“You cannot think | doubt the outcome of such a battle,” Harah said. “Usul could not but win.”\n“That was my meaning,” Jessica said.\n“And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment,” Harah said. She shook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. “How wrong you are. Perhaps you think, as well, that | regret not being the chosen of Usul, that | am jealous of Chani?”\n“You make your own choice as you are able,” Jessica said.\n“| pity Chani,” Harah said.\nJessica stiffened. “What do you mean?”\n“I know what you think of Chani,” Harah said. “You think she is not the wife for your son.”\nJessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. “Perhaps.”\n“You could be right,” Harah said. “If you are, you may find a Surprising ally—Chani herself. She wants whatever is best for Him.”\nJessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. “Chani’s very dear to me,” she said. “She could be no—”\n“Your rugs are very dirty in here,” Harah said. She Swept her gaze around the floor, avoiding Jessica’s\neyes. “So many people tramping through here all the time. You really should have them cleaned more often.”\nYou cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: THE RELIGIOUS ISSUES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul waited on the sand outside the gigantic maker's line of approach. / must not wait like a smuggler—impatient and jittering, he reminded himself. / must be part of the desert.\nThe thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the friction-hissing of its passage. Its great teeth within the cavern-circle of its mouth spread like some enormous flower. The spice odor from it dominated the air.\nPaul’s stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of his nose plugs, the breathing mask. Stilgar’s teaching, the painstaking hours on the sand, overshadowed all else.\n“How far outside the maker’s radius must you Stand in pea sand?” Stilgar had asked him.\nAnd he had answered correctly: “Half a meter for every meter of the maker’s diameter.”\n“Why?”\n“To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount it.”\n“You've ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life,” Stilgar had said. “But what you'll summon for your test is a wild maker, an old man of the desert. You must have proper respect for such a one.”\nNow the thumper’s deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching worm. Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness of sand even through his filters. The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed almost on him. Its cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees.\nCome up, you lovely monster, he thought. Up. You hear me calling. Come up. Come up.\nThe wave lifted his feet. Surface dust swept across him. He steadied himself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand-clouded curving wall, that segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.\nPaul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in. He felt them bite and pull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against the clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the segment, the worm would not roll down and crush him.\nThe worm slowed. It glided across the thumper, silencing it. Slowly, it began to roll—up, up—bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible, away from\nthe sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.\nPaul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like an emperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to turn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.\nSuddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young men who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their backs, removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them.\nLeaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower down the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as it rolled, it turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited.\nPaul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the sensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a triple line behind him, steadied against their hooks.\nStilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul’s hooks, glanced up at Paul’s smiling face.\n“You did it, eh?” Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their passage. “That’s what you think? You did it?” He straightened. “Now | tell you that was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who do better. There was drumsand to your left where you waited. You could not retreat there if the worm turned that way.”\nThe smile slipped from Paul’s face. “I saw the drumsand.”\n“Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to you? It was a thing you could do even in the test.”\nPaul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.\n“You think it bad of me to say this now,” Stilgar said. “It is my duty. | think of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the maker would’ve turned toward you.”\nIn spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth. It took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. “I apologize,” he said. “It will not happen again.”\n“In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take the maker if you cannot,” Stilgar said. “Remember that we work together. That way, we're certain. We work together, eh?”\nHe slapped Paul’s shoulder.\n“We work together,” Paul agreed.\n“Now,” Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, “show me you know how to handle a maker. Which side are we on?”\nPaul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently. As it grew older, the characteristic up-side became an\nalmost constant thing. Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales could be told by size alone on a big worm.\nShifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead. The left-side steersman opened a ring segment there.\nIn a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment. Full around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: “Geyrat!”\nThe steersman released his hook\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARAH<|>PERSON<|>Harah is a woman who speaks about not forgiving and forgetting, and later discusses tribal politics and succession with Jessica)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Reverend Mother who is concerned about her son Paul and the political dynamics within the tribe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THARTHAR<|>PERSON<|>Tharthar is one of Stilgar’s wives who informs Jessica about the young men's plans and escorts Alia to listen to them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a leader of the tribe and a mentor to Paul, teaching him how to ride sandworms and navigate tribal politics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul, also known as Usul and Muad'Dib, is Jessica's son who is undergoing a test to become a sandrider and is central to the tribe's succession struggle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is Jessica's daughter who volunteers to listen to the young men and report back to her mother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Chani is Paul's wife, who is discussed by Harah and Jessica in terms of her suitability for Paul)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHOAB<|>PERSON<|>Shoab is Tharthar's brother who supports the young men's plan to challenge Stilgar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCESS IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>Princess Irulan is the author of a text on the religious and political issues surrounding Muad'Dib)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location mentioned in the text, though its exact context is unclear in this excerpt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDWORM TEST<|>EVENT<|>The sandworm test is a rite of passage for Paul to prove his ability to ride a sandworm and gain respect within the tribe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAZZIA<|>EVENT<|>A razzia is a raid planned by the young men of the tribe, which is part of the political tension surrounding Paul's leadership)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>PAUL<|>Jessica is Paul's mother and is deeply concerned about his safety and political future<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THARTHAR<|>STILGAR<|>Tharthar is one of Stilgar's wives and shares information with Jessica about the tribe's plans<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>STILGAR<|>Paul is being tested and mentored by Stilgar, who is also a potential rival in tribal succession<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARAH<|>THARTHAR<|>Harah and Tharthar have an understanding as future co-wives and discuss tribal politics<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CHANI<|>Paul is married to Chani, and her suitability as his wife is discussed by Harah and Jessica<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>ALIA<|>Jessica is Alia's mother and sends her to gather information about the young men's plans<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SANDWORM TEST<|>Paul undergoes the sandworm test to prove his worth and become a sandrider<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG MEN<|>RAZZIA<|>The young men of the tribe are planning a razzia to challenge Stilgar's leadership<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>SANDWORM TEST<|>Stilgar mentors Paul during the sandworm test and critiques his performance<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
