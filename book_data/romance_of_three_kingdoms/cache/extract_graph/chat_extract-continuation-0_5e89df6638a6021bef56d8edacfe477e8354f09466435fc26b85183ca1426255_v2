�德感伊籍昔日相救之恩，降阶迎之，再三称谢。籍曰：“大公子在江夏，闻荆州已故，蔡夫人与蔡瑁等商议，不来报丧，竟立刘琮为主。公子差人往襄阳探听，回说是实；恐使君不知，特差某赍哀书呈报，并求使君尽起麾下精兵，同往襄阳问罪。”玄德看书毕，谓伊籍曰：“机伯只知刘琮僭立，更不知刘琮已将荆襄九郡献与曹操矣！”籍大惊曰：“使君从何知之？”玄德具言拿获宋忠之事。籍曰：“若如此，使君不如以吊丧为名，前赴襄阳，诱刘琮出迎，就便擒下，诛其党类，则荆州属使君矣。”孔明曰：“机伯之言是也。主公可从之。”玄德垂泪曰：“吾兄临危托孤于我，今若执其子而夺其地，异日死于九泉之下，何面目复见吾兄乎？”孔明曰：“如不行此事，今曹兵已至宛城，何以拒敌？”玄德曰：“不如走樊城以避之。”\n\n
