以为这与昨天的事有关，是将她调离红岸的核心部门，但到监听部后，才发现这里更像红岸的核心。虽然两个部门在设备系统上有重叠之处，比如共用同一个天线，但监听部的技术水平比发射部要先进一个层次。\n　　监听部有套十分先进的电波灵敏接收系统，从巨型天线接收到的信号通过红宝石行波微波激射器放大——为了抑制系统本身的干扰，竟将接收系统的核心部分浸泡于-269℃的液氮中，液氮由直升机定期运来以补充消耗。这使得系统具有极高的灵敏度，能够接收到很微弱的讯号。叶文洁不禁想，如果用这套设备从事射电天文研究，那将是多么美妙的事情啊。\n　　监听部的计算机系统也远比发射部庞大复杂，叶文洁第一次走进主机房时，看到一排阴极射线管显示屏，她惊奇地发现，屏幕上竟滚动着排排程序代码，可以通过键盘随意进行编辑和调试。而她在大学里使用计算机时，代码都写在一张张打格的程序纸上，再通过打字机噼噼啪啪地打到纸带上。她听说过从键盘和屏幕输入这回事，现在竟然真的看到了。但更令她吃惊的是这里的软件技术。她知道了一种叫FORTRAN的东西（注：第一代计算机高级语言），竟能用接近自然语言的代码编写程序。能将数学公式直接写到代码里，它的编程效率比机器码汇编不知高了多少倍。还有一种叫数据库的东西，竟能那样随心所欲地操纵海量数据。\n　　两天后，雷政委又找叶文洁谈话，这次是在监听部的主机房里。在那一排闪着绿光的计算机显示器前。杨卫宁坐在距他们不远处，既不想参加他们的谈话，又不能放心离开，这令叶文洁感到很不自在。\n　　雷政委说：“小叶，现在我向你说明监听部的上作内容，简单地说。就是对敌人的太空活动进行监视，包括监听敌人航天器与地面和航天器间的通讯，与我航天测控部门配合，锁定敌航天器的轨道位置，为红岸系统的作战提供依据。可以说，是红岸的眼睛。”\n　　杨卫宁插进来说：“雷政委，我觉得你这样不好，真的没必要对她说这些。”\n　　叶文洁看看不远处的杨卫宁，不安地说：“政委。如果不适宜让我了解，就……”\n　　“不不，小叶，”雷政委抬起一只手制止叶文洁说下去，转身对杨卫宁说，“杨总，还是那句话，为了工作，要进一步发挥小叶的作用，她该知道的还是得知道。”\n　　杨卫宁站了起来，“我要向上级汇报！”\n　　“这当然是你的权利。不过，杨总，请你放心，对这事，我负一切责任。”雷政委平静地说。\n　　杨卫宁起身悻悻地离去。“你别在意，杨总就这样，过分谨慎。有时工作放不开手脚。”雷政委笑着摇摇头，然后直视着文洁，语气郑重起来，“小叶，最初带你来基地，目的很单\n######################\nOutput:",
