This was only mystic nonsense. How could Tyek be fooled by such stuff? This Preacher had been summoned—most likely by a dream. Of what importance were dreams?\n“This has been a waste of time, Tyek,” Farad’n said. “Why did you subject me to this . . . this farce?”\n“There is a double price here, My Prince,” Tyekanik said. “This interpreter of dreams promised me to deliver Duncan Idaho as an agent of House Corrino. All he asked was to meet you and interpret your dream.” And Tyekanik added to himself: Or so he told Wensicia! New doubts assailed the Bashar.\n“Why is my dream so important to you, old man?” Farad’n asked.\n“Your dream tells me that great events move toward a logical conclusion,” The Preacher said. “I must hasten my return.”\nMocking, Farad’n said: “And you will remain inscrutable, giving me no advice.”\n“Advice, Prince, is a dangerous commodity. But | will venture a few words which you may take as advice or in any other way which pleases you.”\n“By all means,” Farad’n said.\nThe Preacher held his masked face rigidly confronting Farad’n. “Governments may rise and fall for reasons which appear insignificant, Prince. What small events! An argument between two women... which way the wind blows on a certain day ... a sneeze, a cough, the length of a garment or the chance collision of a fleck of sand anda courtier’s eye. It is not always the majestic concerns of Imperial ministers which dictate the course of history, nor is it necessarily the pontifications of priests which move the hands of God.”\nFarad’n found himself profoundly stirred by these words and could not explain his emotion.\nTyekanik, however, had focused on one phrase. Why did this Preacher speak of a garment? Tyekanik’s mind focused on the Imperial costumes dispatched to the Atreides twins, the tigers trained to attack. Was this old man voicing a subtle warning? How much did he know?\n“How is this advice?” Farad’n asked.\n“If you would succeed,” The Preacher said, “you must reduce your strategy to its point of application. Where does one apply strategy? At a particular place and with a particular people in mind. But even with the greatest concern for minutiae, some small detail with no significance attached to it will escape you. Can your strategy, Prince, be reduced to the ambitions of a regional governor’s wife?”\nHis voice cold, Tyekanik interrupted: “Why do you harp upon strategy, Preacher? What is it you think My Prince will have?”\n“He is being led to desire a throne,” The Preacher said. “l wish him good luck, but he will need much more than luck.”\n“These are dangerous words,” Farad’n said. “How is it you dare such words?”\n“Ambitions tend to remain undisturbed by realities,” The Preacher said. “I dare such words because you stand ata crossroad. You could become admirable. But now you are surrounded by those who do not seek moral justifications, by advisors who are strategy-oriented. You are young and strong and tough, but you lack a certain advanced training by which your character might evolve. This is sad because you have weaknesses whose dimensions | have described.”\n“What do you mean?” Tyekanik demanded.\n“Have a care when you speak,” Farad’n said. “What is this weakness?”\n“You’ve given no thought to the kind of society you might prefer,” The Preacher said. “You do not consider the hopes of your subjects. Even the form of the Imperium which you seek has little shape in your imaginings.” He turned his masked face toward Tyekanik. “Your eye is upon the power, not upon its subtle uses and its perils. Your future is filled, thus, with manifest unknowns: with arguing women, with coughs and windy days. How can you create an epoch when you cannot see every detail? Your tough mind will not serve you. This is where you are weak.”\nFarad’n studied the old man for a long space, wondering at the deeper issues implied by such thoughts, at the persistence of such discredited concepts. Morality! Social goals! These were myths to put beside belief in an upward movement of evolution.\nTyekanik said: “We’ve had enough words. What of the price agreed upon, Preacher?”\n“Duncan Idaho is yours,” The Preacher said. “Have a care how you use him. He is a jewel beyond price.”\n“Oh, we've a Suitable mission for him,” Tyekanik said. He glanced at Farad’n. “By your leave, My Prince?”\n“Send him packing before | change my mind,” Farad’n said. Then, glaring at Tyekanik: “I don’t like the way you’ve\nused me, Tyek!”\n“Forgive him, Prince,” The Preacher said. “Your faithful Bashar does God’s will without even knowing it.” Bowing, The Preacher departed, and Tyekanik hurried to see him away.\nFarad’n watched the retreating backs, thought: / must look into this religion which Tyek espouses. And he smiled ruefully. What a dream interpreter! But what matter? My dream was not an important thing.\nAnd he saw a vision of armor. The armor was not his own skin; it was stronger than plasteel. Nothing penetrated his armor—not knife or poison or sand, not the dust of the desert or its desiccating heat. In his right hand he carried the power to make the Coriolis storm, to shake the earth and erode it into nothing. His eyes were fixed upon the Golden Path and in his left hand he carried the scepter of absolute mastery. And beyond the Golden Path, his eyes looked into eternity which he knew to be the food of his soul and of his everlasting flesh.\n—HEIGHIA, MY BROTHER’S DREAM FROM THE BOOK OF GHANIMA\n44 | t'd be better for me never to become Emperor,” Leto\nsaid. “Oh, | don’t imply that I’ve made my father’s mistake and peered into the future with a glass of spice. | say this thing out of selfishness. My sister and | desperately need a time of freedom when we can learn how to live with what we are.”\nHe fell silent, stared questioningly at the Lady Jessica. He’d spoken his piece as he and Ghanima had agreed. Now what would be their grandmother’s response?\nJessica studied her grandson in the low light of glowglobes which illuminated her quarters in Sietch Tabr. It was still early morning of her second day here and she’d already had disturbing reports that the twins had spent a night of vigil outside the sietch. What were they doing? She had not slept well and she felt fatigue acids demanding that she come down from the hyper-level which had sustained her through all the demanding necessities since that crucial performance at the spaceport. This was the sietch of her nightmares—but outside, that was not the desert she remembered. Where have all the flowers come from? And\nthe air around her felt too damp. Stillsuit discipline was lax among the young.\n“What are you, child, that you need time to learn about yourself?” she asked.\nHe shook his head gently, Knowing it to be a bizarre gesture of adulthood on a child’s body, reminding himself that he must keep this woman off balance. “First, | am nota child. Oh...” He touched his chest. “This is a child’s body; no doubt of that. But /am not a child.”\nJessica chewed her upper lip, disregarding what this betrayed. Her Duke, so many years dead on this accursed planet, had laughed at her when she did this. “Your one unbridled response,” he'd called that chewing of the lip. “It tells me that you're disturbed, and I must kiss those lips to still their fluttering.”\nNow this grandson who bore the name of her Duke shocked her into heart-pounding stillness merely by smiling and saying: “You are disturbed; | see it by the fluttering of those lips.”\nIt required the most profound discipline of her Bene Gesserit training to restore a semblance of calm. She managed: “Do you taunt me?”\n“Taunt you? Never. But | must make it clear to you how much we differ. Let me remind you of that sietch orgy so long ago when the Old Reverend Mother gave you her lives and her memories. She tuned herself to you and gave you that... that long chain of sausages, each one a person. You have them yet. So you know something of what Ghanima and | experience.”\n“And Alia?” Jessica asked, testing him.\n“Didn’t you discuss that with Ghani?”\n“I wish to discuss it with you.”\n“Very well. Alia denied what she was and became that which she most feared. The past-within cannot be relegated to the unconscious. That is a dangerous course for any\nhuman, but for us who are pre-born, it is worse than death. And that is all | will say about Alia.”\n“So you’re not a child,” Jessica said.\n“I’m millions of years old. That requires adjustments which humans have never before been called upon to make.”\nJessica nodded, calmer now, much more cautious than she’d been with Ghanima. And where was Ghanima? Why had Leto come here alone?\n“Well, grandmother,” he said, “are we Abominations or are we the hope of the Atreides?”\nJessica ignored the question. “Where is your sister?”\n“She distracts Alia to keep us from being disturbed. It is necessary. But Ghani would say nothing more to you than I’ve said. Didn’t you observe that yesterday?”\n“What | observed yesterday is my affair. Why do you prattle about Abomination?”\n“Prattle? Don’t give me your Bene Gesserit cant, grandmother. l'Il feed it back to you, word for word, right out of your own memories. | want more than the fluttering of your lips.”\nJessica shook her head, feeling the coldness of this... person who carried her blood. The resources at his disposal daunted her. She tried to match his tone, asked: “What do you know of my intentions?”\nHe sniffed. “You needn’t inquire whether I’ve made the mistake my father made. I’ve not looked outside our garden of time—at least not by seeking it out. Leave absolute knowledge of the future to those moments of déjà vu which any human may experience. | know the trap of prescience. My father’s life tells me what I need to know about it. No, grandmother: to know the future absolutely is to be trapped into that future absolutely. It collapses time. Present becomes future. | require more freedom than that.”\nJessica felt her tongue twitch with unspoken words. How could she respond to him with something he didn’t already\nknow? This was monstrous! He’s me! He’s my beloved Leto! This thought shocked her. Momentarily she wondered if the childish mask might not lapse into those dear features and resurrect... No!\nLeto lowered his head, looked upward to study her. Yes, she could be maneuvered after all. He said: “When you think of prescience, which | hope is rarely, you’re probably no different from any other. Most people imagine how nice it would be to know tomorrow’s quotation on the price of whale fur. Or whether a Harkonnen will once more govern their homeworld of Giedi Prime? But of course we know the Harkonnens without prescience, don’t we, grandmother?”\nShe refused to rise to his baiting. Of course he would know about the cursed Hark\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_08878bc5912e902da3a674d1394130d18c55d9f22bed198def9582a9089ba76a_v2"}
