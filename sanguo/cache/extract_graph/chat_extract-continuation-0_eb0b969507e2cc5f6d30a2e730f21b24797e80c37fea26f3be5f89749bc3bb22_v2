�，分兵两骆，徐徐退入西川去了。张郃见蜀兵退去，恐有计策，不敢来追，乃引兵往见司马懿曰：“今蜀兵退去，不知何意？”懿曰：“孔明诡计极多，不可轻动。不如坚守，待他粮尽，自然退去。”大将魏平出曰：“蜀兵拔祁山之营而退，正可乘势追之，都督按兵不动，畏蜀如虎，奈天下笑何？”懿坚执不从。\n\n    却说孔明知祁山兵已回，遂令杨仪、马忠入帐，授以密计，令先引一万弓弩手，去剑阁木门道，两下埋伏；若魏兵追到，听吾炮响，急滚下木石，先截其去路，两头一齐射之。二人引兵去了。又唤魏延、关兴引兵断后，城上四面遍插旌旗，城内乱堆柴草，虚放烟火。大兵尽望木门道而去。\n\n    魏营巡哨军来报司马懿曰：“蜀兵大队已退，但不知城中还有多少兵。”懿自往视之，见城上插旗，城中烟起，笑曰：“此乃空城也。”令人探之，果是空城，懿大喜曰：“孔明已退，谁敢追之？”先锋张郃曰：“吾愿往。”懿阻曰：“公性急躁，不可去。”郃曰：“都督出关之时，命吾为先锋；今日正是立功之际，却不用吾，何也？”懿曰：“蜀兵退去，险阻处必有埋伏，须十分仔细，方可追之。”郃曰：“吾已知得，不必挂虑。”懿曰：“公自欲去，莫要追悔。”郃曰：“大丈夫舍身报国，虽万死无恨。”懿曰：“公既坚执要去，可引五千兵先行；却教魏平引二万马步兵后行，以防埋伏。吾却引三千兵随后策应。”\n\n    张郃领命，引兵火速望前追赶。行到三十余里，忽然背后一声喊起，树林内闪出一彪军，为首大将，横刀勒马大叫曰：“贼将引兵那里去！”郃回头视之，乃魏延也。郃大怒，回马交锋。不十合，延诈败而走。郃又追赶三十余里，勒马回顾，全无伏兵，又策马前追。方转过山坡，忽喊声大起，一彪军闪出，为首大将，乃关兴也，横刀勒马大叫曰：“张郃休赶！有吾在此！”郃就拍马交锋。不十合，兴拨马便走。郃随后追之。赶到一密林内，郃心疑，令人四下哨探，并无伏兵；于是放心又赶。不想魏延却抄在前面；郃又与战十余合，延又败走。郃奋怒追来，又被关兴抄在前面，截住去路。郃大怒，拍马交锋，战有十合，蜀兵尽弃衣甲什物等件，塞满道路，魏军皆下马争取。延、兴二将，轮流交战，张郃奋勇追\n######################\nOutput:",
