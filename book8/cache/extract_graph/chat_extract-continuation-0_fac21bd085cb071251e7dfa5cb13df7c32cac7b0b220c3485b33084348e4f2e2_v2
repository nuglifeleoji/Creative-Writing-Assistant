娜娜走到护栏旁边，目光看向护栏外。\n\n    蓝潇一家也跟了上去，她是要证明什么吗？\n\n    蓝轩宇顺着娜娜注视的目光向外看去，护栏外是一片空旷，卖场的中央空间是一个巨大的挑空，足有数百米的高度。而此时从他们所在的楼层向下看，也有百米左右的高度。\n\n    卖场一层是一个巨大的喷泉池，直径足有五十米开外，每过半个小时，就会有喷泉涌出。是卖场内重要的景观之一。先前蓝轩宇还曾因为看到大喷泉而兴奋呢。\n\n    此时喷泉并没有喷射，水池水面光滑如镜。\n\n    看着那水池，娜娜用只有她自己才能听到的声音喃喃的自言自语道：“我应该能够做一些事情的。”\n\n    一边说着，她缓缓抬起手，按上了面前的玻璃护栏。\n\n    在那一瞬间，下意识的，蓝潇一家都不禁向她看去。\n\n    她要做什么呢？而令他们有些疑惑的是，从娜娜身上，他们并没有感受到任何魂力的波动。\n\n    蓝潇和南澄是完全没有感觉。而就在这时，蓝轩宇却突然感觉到自己的左臂似乎微微有些发热，下意识的，他向娜娜的方向走出两步，心中突然涌出一种特别想要和她亲近的感觉。\n\n    南澄以为儿子是好奇，赶忙一把将他拉住，不让他靠近过去。\n\n    而就在这时，下方水池突然出现了变化。\n------------\n\n第三十四章 九龙戏珠\n\n    平静的水面出现了涟漪，一圈圈旋转的波纹由内而外，几乎只是几次呼吸的时间，那巨大的水池就已经变成了一个漩涡。\n\n    正在进入商场的民众们顿时发现了变化，在惊叹声中驻足观看。\n\n    下一瞬，那一圈圈漩涡缓缓向上攀升，池水竟然脱离了水池缓缓升起。\n\n    “水龙卷？”南澄脱口而出。她是冰元素掌控者，对于水元素自然也是十分亲和，距离百米，让水池中的水元素化为水龙卷，这可不是六阶魂帝层次强者能做到的。\n\n    也就是说，身边这个明显要比自己更年轻的女孩儿，至少也是魂帝以上层次的强者。\n\n    更何况，那水龙卷还在持续攀升，转瞬之间，竟然已经攀升到百米高，旋涡最高处已经到了接近和他们齐平的地方。\n\n    娜娜眼底银光一闪，水龙卷中心水花翻涌，一条水龙缓缓凝聚而出，在低沉的龙吟声中居然就那么飞腾起来。\n\n    因为距离最近，所以蓝潇一家看的最为清楚，那水龙不是只具外表，看上去凝实的宛如真�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
