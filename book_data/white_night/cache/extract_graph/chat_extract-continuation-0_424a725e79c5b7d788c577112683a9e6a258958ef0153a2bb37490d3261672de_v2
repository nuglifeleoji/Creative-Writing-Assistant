不时左手挥出，地面上就会出现那么一两根冰刺。然后后面冲上来的熔岩犬就悲剧了。\n\n    但这毕竟是模拟舱的虚拟世界，熔岩犬被赋予的程序就是要击杀敌人。所以，它们依旧悍不畏死的追上。\n\n    三头百年熔岩犬终于出现了。从三个不同的门走出来。\n\n    看到它们，蓝轩宇嘴角处流露出一丝微笑，突然转身，朝着身后的十年熔岩犬群冲了过去。\n\n    先前考核中的经验在这个时候就完全展现了出来。三头百年熔岩犬，几乎每次出现之后的第一件事都是……，喷火球！\n\n    这次当然也不会改变。三枚火球，从不同的方向飞向蓝轩宇。而此时的蓝轩宇，却已经冲进了后面追来的十年熔岩犬群之中。\n\n    目光凝实，这一瞬，蓝轩宇只觉得自己脑海中的一切突然变得无比清晰，似乎眼前的所有十年熔岩犬动作都变慢了似的，他左一晃、右一晃，速度陡增的同时，宛如鬼魅般切入犬群之中。却总是能从夹缝中掠过。\n\n    这样的战斗过程他也还是第一次，面前是一只只恶形恶状的十年熔岩犬，它们身上带着炽热的温度和恶臭。就是那么的近在咫尺。\n------------\n\n第九十八章 测试战力\n\n

这一下他的速度很快，右手全面发力之下，产生出强有力的爆发力。顿时，只听身后轰鸣声连响，还有一连串的惨叫悲鸣。\n\n    顾不得回看，冲出重围之后，他迅速前冲，直奔其中一只百年熔岩犬的方向冲去。\n\n    此时熔岩犬正在混乱，毫无疑问，十年熔岩犬已经伤亡大半，但最重要的对他来说还是如何解决三头百年熔岩犬。一对一的情况下，他有一定把握，所以一定不能让三头百年熔岩犬会聚在一处。\n\n
