   行至襄阳东门，只见城上遍插旌旗，壕边密布鹿角，玄德勒马大叫曰：“刘琮贤侄，吾但欲救百姓，并无他念。可快开门。”刘琮闻玄德至，惧而不出。蔡瑁、张允径来敌楼上，叱军士乱箭射下。城外百姓，皆望敌楼而哭。城中忽有一将，引数百人径上城楼，大喝：“蔡瑁、张允卖国之贼！刘使君乃仁德之人，今为救民而来投，何得相拒！”众视其人，身长八尺，面如重枣；乃义阳人也，姓魏，名延，字文长。当下魏延轮刀砍死守门将士，开了城门，放下吊桥，大叫：“刘皇叔快领兵入城，共杀卖国之贼！”张飞便跃马欲入，玄德急止之曰：“休惊百姓！”魏延只管招呼玄德军马入城。只见城内一将飞马引军而出，大喝：“魏延无名小卒，安敢造乱！认得我大将文聘么！”魏延大怒，挺枪跃马，便来交战。两下军兵在城边混杀，喊声大震。玄德曰：“本欲保民，反害民也！吾不愿入襄阳！”孔明曰：“江陵乃荆州要地，不如先取江陵为家。”玄德曰：“正合吾心。”于是引着百姓，尽离襄阳大路，望江陵而走。襄阳城中百姓，多有乘乱逃出城来，跟玄德而去。魏延与文聘交战，从已至未，手下兵卒皆已折尽。延�\n######################\nOutput:",
