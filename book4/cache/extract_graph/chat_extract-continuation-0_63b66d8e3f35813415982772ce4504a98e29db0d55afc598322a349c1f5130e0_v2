的滋味”。从地委行署的一般干部到部局长们，谁也没有留意给孩子和他人带来欢乐的孙少平——他已悄悄地回到了他住的那孔窑洞里……当天晚上，在地委大灶上吃完饭后，少平正准备去找晓霞，旁边窑洞的一位干部过来告诉他，说门房打来电活，外面有个人找他，让你出去一下。 \n　　少平忍不住心一缩：谁？是家里的人？出什么事了？谁病了？ \n　　他一边匆促地向地委大门口走，一边还在猜测谁来找他。会不会是家里托人来给他捎话，让他回去、除过老人生病，按说这一段不会有什么大事——唯一的大事就是妹妹兰香考上大学。不过，考上考不上，现在还没到发榜的时候呢！ \n　　快要到大门口时，少平才发现，立在大门外的是阳沟大队的曹书记！他悬在半空中的心踏实了下来。 \n　　不过，曹书记这时候来找他，有什么事呢？没紧事他不会到这里来找他！ \n　　自他在阳沟安下户口后，由于四处奔波着干活，很少能抽出时间回那里去。虽说他成了阳沟人，但实际上只是个名义；除过户口，他在那里一无所有。当然，他仍然很感激曹书记两口子给他办了这么一件大事。几个月来，他已经拿着礼物去看望过他们好几次……孙少平一直不知道曹书记两口早把他当未来的女婿看待了。曹书记两口早就商量好：如果他们的女儿再一次考不上高中，他们就要和少平摊开说这件事。说实话，如果不是要招女婿，他们也不会帮助他把户口落在阳沟大队。 \n　　不久前，曹书记的女儿考高中又没考上。看来这孩子的书不能再念下去了。于是，书记老婆才把少平的事提到了女儿的面前。不料，菊英学习不中用，找对象的眼头倒蛮高。她说她看不上孙少平！话说回来，这也难怪。菊英虽然是农村户口，但一直在黄原城里长大，怎么可能看上一个乡下来的揽工汉呢？她对父母亲表示，她决不可能和这个叫孙少平的乡巴佬结婚；她要在黄原城找个有工作的对象哩！ \n　　曹书记两口子四只眼大瞪。他们决没想到，他们各方面都平庸的女儿，竟然看不上他们精心挑选的孙少平！ \n　　这可怎么办？这不仅使他们的愿望落了空，也把人家娃娃闪在了半路上！如果少平成了他们的上门女婿，那阳沟队其他人有什么，少平就得有什么；如果没这个关系，少平怕连空头户口也落不长久！ \n　　正在曹书记发愁的时候，事情突然有了一个转机。 \n　　根据市上下达的文件，今年铜城矿务局要在黄原市招收二十来名农村户口的煤矿工人。他们公社的领导人是他的酒肉朋友，跑来问他有没有什么亲戚要去。 \n　　曹书记大喜！\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
