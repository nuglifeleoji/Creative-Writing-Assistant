He is noted as an observer of the relationship between Leto II and Ghanima, the twin children of Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib), suggesting his close involvement in the affairs of the Atreides lineage. Additionally, Harq al-Ada plays a pivotal role as the reconstructor of Muad’Dib's words, preserving and disseminating his father's teachings, which underscores his importance as a chronicler of Atreides history.  \n\nFurther cementing his legacy, Harq al-Ada is identified as an ancestor of Siona Atreides, a key figure in the later events of the *Dune* saga.
