The ritual has been observed in various instances, such as between Lucilla and Rebecca, as well as among Odrade, Murbella, and Sheeana, highlighting its role in strengthening the collective wisdom of the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nThe process involves a profound mental and spiritual connection, allowing one individual to share their memories with another, thereby enriching the recipient's understanding and capabilities. While the descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing the exchange of memories and experiences, while others focus on the transfer of knowledge—the core purpose remains consistent: to facilitate the seamless flow of information within the Sisterhood.  \n\nThe ritual is not merely transactional but also serves as a bonding experience, reinforcing the interconnectedness of Bene Gesserit members.
