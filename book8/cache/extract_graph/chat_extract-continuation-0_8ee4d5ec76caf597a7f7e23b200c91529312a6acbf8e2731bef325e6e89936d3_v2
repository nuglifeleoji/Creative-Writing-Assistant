略微思考了一下，蓝轩宇心中一动，脸上顿时露出了笑容。因为他突然发现，自己的运气很好。因为，他出现的这个地方，可是有一条小河的啊！\n\n    这条小河其实说是小溪也差不多，宽不过两米，深度能有两尺就不错了。\n\n    可不管怎么说，这也是一条河啊！水元素要比其他地方更加充沛，而拥有水元素掌控的他，无疑在这里能够发挥出更大的实力。\n\n    老师们上课时早就教导过，魂师的实力，和所处环境呈正相关。譬如，植物系魂师在有植物的地方，就能发挥出更强的实力。火属性魂师在正午发挥出的实力就更强。\n\n    毫无疑问，此时所处的这个环境对于蓝轩宇来说肯定是最有利的。他的武魂是蓝银草，本身就是植物系，再加上这里还有充沛的水元素，无形之中，就让他的整体实力上升了几分。\n\n    不就是活下去吗？在这最适合自己武魂的地方，肯定能活的更好吧。想到这里，蓝轩宇已经做好了决定，直接找了块石头坐了下来。看着周围的美景，不亦乐乎。\n\n    紫萝分院体育馆。\n\n    牧重天和其他几位本院老师站在一个大屏幕前，屏幕一共有是个分屏，呈现出十名学员在虚拟世界森林中不同位置的表现。\n\n    被虚拟出的当然不会是一片普通森林，而是一片魂兽森林，至于学生们会在森林中遭遇什么，都是随机的。但他们的表现都会被记录在案，会根据随意遇到的情况和应变来打分。\n\n    因为蓝轩宇先前惊人的九十九点精神力，所以特别被牧重天所注意，他的分屏显示也被放在了中央。\n\n    当牧重天看到这孩子在河边找了块石头坐了下来的时候，脸上的表情顿时变得古怪起来。\n\n    “现在的孩子，确实是缺乏一些常识啊！”牧重天有些无奈的说道。\n\n    旁边另一名老师笑道：“这不是显而易见的吗？他们从小在城市中长大，又何曾去过魂兽森林这种地方。当然也更不知道魂兽的习性了。魂灵的存在，再加上魂兽被隔绝在专门星球生存，让有关于魂兽的知识变得越来越不重要，甚至在高级学院都是选修课。他才八岁吧，又怎么会知道森林中的水源地一定是最容易遇到魂兽的。”\n\n    牧重天耸了耸肩膀，道：“我们这考核的烈度最强到什么程度？”\n\n    “千年魂兽吧。毕竟这些孩子太小，就算是千年魂兽，秒杀他们的可能性都很强。不过我们做过设定，千年魂兽都是相对来说性格较为温和的。省得给这些孩子们留下心理阴影。”\n\n    牧重天\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
