The Landsraad plays a critical role in balancing the authority of the Emperor, ensuring that no single ruler holds unchecked power within the Imperium. As part of the Imperial power structure, the Landsraad serves as a counterbalance to the Emperor's influence, fostering a system of checks and balances. This arrangement underscores the Imperium's reliance on collaboration between the Emperor and the Great Houses, with the Landsraad acting as a key institution to maintain stability and prevent autocratic rule.
