“比起在你们研究室喝的即溶咖啡，这实在好喝太多了。”草S啜了一口纸杯中的咖啡说，这是为了让常磐放松心情。\n    常磐笑了，但脸颊似乎还是僵着。  \n  本想先闲话家常，但草S判断在这种情况下是白费力气，于是决定直接切入正题。 \n  “我想问的，是汤川副教授的事。”草S说，“他最近有没有哪里不一样？”\n    常磐一脸困惑。大概是我问的方式不对吧，草S想。 \n  “他有没有为了和大学工作无关的事，正在调查什么，或是出门上哪去过？”\n    常磐歪着头，似乎是在认真思考。\n    草S对他一笑。 \n  “当然，这并不表示他和什么案件有关。解释起来可能有点困难，总之我觉得汤川好像在顾忌我，有事瞒着我。我想你也知道，那家伙向来个性偏执。” \n虽然不确定这样的解释对方能理解多少，不过研究生总算略微放松表情点点头，也许只是在同意个性偏执这一点。  \n  “我是不知道老师有没有在调查什么，不过几天前，老师曾经打电话去图书馆。”常磐说。\n    “图书馆？你们大学的？”\n    常磐点头。\n    “好像是问馆里有没有报纸。”\n    “报纸？既然是图书馆，起码都会有报纸吧。”\n    “是没错，不过汤川老师想知道的，好像是旧报纸保管到什么程度。”\n    “旧报纸吗……” \n  “不过，好像也不是非常久之前的报纸。我记得老师好像是问，能不能一次看到这个月的报纸。”\n    “这个月的啊……结果呢？有吗？”\n    “我想图书馆应该有，因为老师后来立刻就去了图书馆了。”\n    草S点点头对常磐道谢，拿着大约还剩一半咖啡的纸杯站起来。  \n  帝都大学的图书馆是栋三层楼的小型建筑，草S以前还在这所大学当学生时，总共只来过图书馆两、三次，所以连是否经过整修都不确定。在他看来，建筑物似乎还很新。\n   一进去就是柜台，里头坐着一名女馆员，于是他试着问起汤川副教授查阅报纸的事。她露出狐疑的表情。\n   草S只好拿出警察手册。 \n  “不是汤川老师怎么样的问题。我只是很想知道，那时他看了什么报道而已。”他知道这样问很不自然，却想不出其他的方式来表达。\n    “在我印象中，他应该是想看三月份的报导。”女馆员慎重地回答。\n    “三月份的？什么报导？” \n  “这我就不太清楚了。”说完，她好像又想起什么似地微微张口，“我记得他好像还说，只要社会版就行了。”\n    “社会版？那么报纸在哪里？”  \n  这边请，说着她带他去的是摆放成排平台架子\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>草S<|>PERSON<|>草S is a character who is inquiring about Professor Takagawa's
