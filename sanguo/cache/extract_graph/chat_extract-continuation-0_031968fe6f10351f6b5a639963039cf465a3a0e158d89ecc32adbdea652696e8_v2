�操。操闻知，急上马，从阵后来。张飞睁圆环眼，隐隐见后军青罗伞盖、旄钺旌旗来到，料得是曹操心疑，亲自来看。飞乃厉声大喝曰：“我乃燕人张翼德也！谁敢与我决一死战？”声如巨雷。曹军闻之，尽皆股栗。曹操急令去其伞盖，回顾左右曰：“我向曾闻云长言：翼德于百万军中，取上将之首，如探囊取物。今日相逢，不可轻敌。”言未已，张飞睁目又喝曰：“燕人张翼德在此！谁敢来决死战？”曹操见张飞如此气概，颇有退心。飞望见曹操后军阵脚移动，乃挺矛又喝曰：“战又不战，退又不退，却是何故！”喊声未绝，曹操身边夏侯杰惊得肝胆碎裂，倒撞于马下。操便回马而走。于是诸军众将一齐望西奔走。正是：黄口孺子，怎闻霹雳之声；病体樵夫，难听虎豹之吼。一时弃枪落盔者，不计其数，人如潮涌，马似山崩，自相践踏。后人有诗赞曰：“长坂桥头杀气生，横枪立马眼圆睁。一声好似轰雷震，独退曹家百万兵。”\n\n

却说曹操惧张飞之威，骤马望西而走，冠簪尽落，披发奔逃。张辽、许褚赶上，扯住辔环。曹操仓皇失措。张辽曰：“丞相休惊。料张飞一人，何足深惧！今急回军杀去，刘备可擒也。”曹操神色方才稍定，乃令张辽、许褚再至长坂桥探听消息。且说张飞见曹军一拥而退，不敢追赶；速唤回原随二十余骑，解去马尾树枝，令将桥梁拆断，然后回马来见玄德，具言断桥一事。玄德曰：“吾弟勇则勇矣，惜失于计较。”飞问其故。玄德曰：“曹操多谋。汝不合拆断桥梁，彼必追至矣。”飞曰：“他被我一喝，倒退数里，何敢再追？”玄德曰：“若不断桥，彼恐有埋伏，不敢进兵，今拆断了桥，彼料我无军而怯，必来追赶。彼有百万之众，虽涉江汉，可填而过，岂惧一桥之断耶？”于是即刻起身，从小路斜投汉津，望沔阳路而走。却说曹操使张辽、许褚探长坂桥消息，回报曰：“张飞已拆断桥梁而去矣。”操曰：“彼断桥而去，乃心怯也。”遂传令差一万军，速搭三座浮桥，只今夜就要过。李典曰：“此恐是诸葛亮之诈谋，不可轻进。”操曰：“张飞一勇之夫，岂有诈谋！”遂传下号令，火速进兵。\n\n
