None of them had seen a Face Dancer replace their High Priest. There had been no body to see. Every bit of evidence was the evidence of human voices saying things that might be lies. Belatedly, several looked at Odrade. Her voice was one of those that had convinced them.\nWaff, too, was looking at Odrade.\nShe smiled and addressed herself to the Tleilaxu Master. “It suits our purposes that the High Priesthood not pass into other hands at this time,” she said.\nWaff immediately saw the advantage to himself. This was a wedge between priests and Bene Gesserit. This removed one of the most dangerous holds the Sisterhood had on the Tleilaxu.\n“It suits my purposes, too,” he said.\nAs the priests once more lifted their voices in anger, Taraza came in right on cue: “Which of you will break our accord?” she demanded.\nTuek thrust two of his counselors aside and strode across the room to the Mother Superior. He stopped only a pace from her.\n“What game is this?” he asked.\n“We support you against those who would replace you,” she said. “The Bene Tleilaxu join us in this. It is our way of demonstrating that we, too, have a vote in selecting the High Priest.”\nSeveral priestly voices were raised in unison: “Is he or is he not a Face Dancer?”\nTaraza looked benignly at the man in front of her: “Are you a Face Dancer?”\n“Of course not!”\nTaraza looked at Odrade, who said: “There seems to have been a mistake.”\nOdrade singled out Albertus among the priests and locked eyes with him. “Sheeana,” Odrade said, “what should the Church of the Divided God do now?”\nAs she had been briefed to do, Sheeana stepped out of her guardian enclosure and spoke with all of the hauteur she had been taught: “They shall continue to serve God!”\n“The business of this meeting appears to have been concluded,” Taraza said. “If you need protection, High Priest Tuek, a squad of our guardians awaits in the hall. They are yours to command.”\nThey could see acceptance and understanding in him. He had become a creature of the Bene Gesserit. He remembered nothing of his Face Dancer origins.\nWhen the priests and Tuek had gone, Waff sent a single word at Taraza, speaking in the language of the Islamiyat: “Explain!”\nTaraza stepped away from her guards, appearing to make herself vulnerable. It was a calculated move they had debated in front of Sheeana. In the same language, Taraza said: “We release our grip on the Bene Tleilax.”\nThey waited while he weighed her words. Taraza reminded herself that the Tleilaxu name for themselves could be translated as “the un-nameable.” That was a label often reserved for gods.\nThis god obviously had not extended the discovery in here to what might be happening with his mimics among Ixians and Fish Speakers. Waff had more shocks coming. He appeared quite puzzled, though.\nWaff confronted many unanswered questions. He was not satisfied with his reports from Gammu. It was a dangerous double game he played now. Did the Sisterhood play a similar game? But the Tleilaxu Lost Ones could not be shunted aside without inviting attack by the Honored Matres. Taraza herself had warned of this. Did the old Bashar on Gammu still represent a force worthy of consideration?\nHe voiced this question.\nTaraza countered with her own question: “How did you change our ghola? What did you hope to gain?” She felt certain she already knew. But the pose of ignorance was necessary.\nWaff wanted to say: “The death of all Bene Gesserit!” They were too dangerous. Yet their value was incalculable. He sank into a sulking silence, looking at the Reverend Mothers with a brooding expression that made his elfin features even more childlike.\nA petulant child, Taraza thought. She warned herself then that it was dangerous to underestimate Waff. You broke the Tleilaxu egg only to find another egg inside—ad infinitum! Everything circled back to Odrade’s suspicions about the contentions that might still lead them to bloody violence in this room. Had the Tleilaxu really revealed what they had learned from the whores and the other Lost Ones? Was the ghola only a potential Tleilaxu weapon?\nTaraza decided to prod him once more, using the approach of her Council’s “Analysis Nine.” Still in the language of the Islamiyat, she said: “Would you dishonor yourself in the land of the Prophet? You have not shared openly as you said you would.”\n“We told you the sexual—”\n“You do not share all!” she interrupted. “It’s because of the ghola and we know this.”\nShe could see his reactions. He was a cornered animal. Such animals were dangerous in the extreme. She had once seen a mongrel hound, a feral and tail-tucked survivor of ancient pets from Dan, cornered by a pack of youths. The animal turned on its pursuers, slashing its way to freedom in totally unexpected savagery. Two youths crippled for life and only one without injuries! Waff was like that animal right now. She could see his hands longing for a weapon, but Tleilaxu and Bene Gesserit had searched one another with exquisite care before coming here. She felt sure he had no weapon. Still...\nWaff spoke, baited suspense in his manner. “You think me unaware of how you hope to rule us!”\n“And there is the rot that the people of the Scattering took with them,” she said. “Rot at the core.”\nWaff’s manner changed. It did not do to ignore the deeper implications of Bene Gesserit thought. But was she sowing discord?\n“The Prophet set a locator ticking in the minds of every human, Scattered or not,” Taraza said. “He has brought\nthem back to us with all of the rot intact.”\nWaff ground his teeth. What was she doing? He entertained the mad thought that the Sisterhood had clogged his mind with some secret drug in the air. They knew things denied to others! He stared from Taraza to Odrade and back to Taraza. He knew he was old with serial ghola resurrections but not old in the way of the Bene Gesserit. These people were old! They seldom looked old but they were old, old beyond anything he dared imagine.\nTaraza was having similar thoughts. She had seen the flash of deeper awareness in Waff’s eyes. Necessity opened new doors of reason. How deep did the Tleilaxu go? His eyes were so old! She had the feeling that whatever had been a brain in these Tleilaxu Masters was now something else—a holo-recording from which all weakening emotions had been erased. She shared the distrust of emotions that she suspected in him. Was that a bond to unite them?\nThe tropism of common thoughts.\n“You say you release your grip on us,” Waff growled, “but | feel your fingers around my throat.”\n“Then here is a grip on our throat,” she said. “Some of your Lost Ones have returned to you. Never has a Reverend Mother come back to us from the Scattering.”\n“But you said you knew all of the—”\n“We have other ways of gaining knowledge. What do you Suppose happened to the Reverend Mothers we sent out into the Scattering?”\n“A common disaster?” He shook his head. This was absolutely new information. None of the returned Tleilaxu had said anything at all about this. The discrepancy fed his suspicions. Whom was he to believe?\n“They were subverted,” Taraza said.\nOdrade, hearing the general suspicion voiced for the first time by the Mother Superior, sensed the enormous power implicit in Taraza’s simple statement. Odrade was cowed by it. She knew the resources, the contingency plans, the\nimprovised ways a Reverend Mother might use to surmount barriers. Something Out There could stop that?\nWhen Waff did not respond, Taraza said: “You come to us with dirty hands.”\n“You dare say this?” Waff asked. “You who continue to deplete our resources in the ways taught you by the Bashar’s mother?”\n“We knew you could afford the losses if you had resources from the Scattering,” Taraza said.\nWaff inhaled a trembling breath. So the Bene Gesserit knew even this. He saw in part how they had learned it. Well, a way would have to be found to bring the false Tuek back under control. Rakis was the prize the Scattered Ones really sought and it might yet be demanded of the Tleilaxu.\nTaraza moved even closer to Waff, alone and vulnerable. She saw her guards grow tense. Sheeana took a small step toward the Mother Superior and was pulled back by Odrade.\nOdrade kept her attention on the Mother Superior and not on potential attackers. Were the Tleilaxu truly convinced that the Bene Gesserit would serve them? Taraza had tested the limits of it, no doubt of that. And in the language of the Islamiyat. But she looked very alone out there away from her guards and so near Waff and his people. Where would Waff’s obvious suspicions lead him now?\nTaraza shivered.\nOdrade saw it. Taraza had been abnormally thin as a child and had never put on an excess ounce of fat. This made her exquisitely sensitive to temperature changes, intolerant of cold, but Odrade sensed no such change in the room. Taraza had made a dangerous decision then, so dangerous that her body betrayed her. Not dangerous to herself, of course, but dangerous to the Sisterhood. There was the most awful Bene Gesserit crime: disloyalty to their own order.\n“We will serve you in all ways except one,” Taraza said. “We will never become receptacles for gholas!”\nWaff paled.\nTaraza continued: “None of us is now nor will ever become...” she paused “...an axlotl tank.”\nWaff raised his right hand in the start of a gesture every Reverend Mother knew: the signal for his Face Dancers to attack.\nTaraza pointed at his upraised hand. “If you complete that gesture, the Tleilaxu will lose everything. The messenger of God—” Taraza nodded over a shoulder toward Sheeana “— will turn her back upon you and the words of the Prophet will be dust in your mouths.”\nIn the language of the Islamiyat, such words were too much for Waff. He lowered his hand but he continued to glower at Taraza.\n“My ambassador said we would share everything we know,” Taraza said. “You said you, too, would share. The messenger of God listens with the ears of the Prophet! What pours forth from the Abdl of the Tleilaxu?”\nWaff’s shoulders sagged.\nTaraza turned her back on him. It was an artful move but both she and the other Reverend Mothers present knew she did it now in perfect safety. Looking across the room at Odrade, Taraza allowed herself a smile that she knew Odrade would interpret correctly. Time for a bit of Bene Gesserit punishment!\n“The Tleilaxu desire an Atreides for breeding,” Taraza said. “I give you Darwi Odrade. More will be supplied.”\nWaff came to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7c6917600a46f4a83e84588eb3adfb224b776551eeb1b4bdbfdf8167c949556d_v2"}
