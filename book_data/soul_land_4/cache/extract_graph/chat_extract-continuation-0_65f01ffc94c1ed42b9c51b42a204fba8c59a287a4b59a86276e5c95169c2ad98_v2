飞的两架直升机也无声无息地掉进大洋，船队指挥部只好放弃救援的努力，两万四千多孩子个葬身于漆黑的太平洋中。剩下的三十八艘船继续在大风浪中进行着艰难的航行。在这之前，孩子们早已领略了航程的严酷：先是受恶劣的舱内条件和晕船的折磨，然后是食品短缺，每人每人的定量只够一顿吃饱。蔬菜更是没有，维生素药片也数量有限，有一半的孩子患了夜盲症，败血病患者也越来越多。在这艰难的条件下，孩子们仍然保持着严明的纪律，大队中队和小队的组织结构仍然完好，各级小领导者们都坚守在自己的岗位上，用前所未有的献身精神行使着自己的职责。到达美洲后，孩子们是否仍能保持这样的组织和纪律，将是中国孩子所面临的第一个严峻考验，这考验比风暴和饥饿可怕得多。但孩子们对此是充满信心的，十多天的航程证实了华华在起航时说的话：\n　　“小朋友们，我们去的不是天堂，而是战场！”\n　　前天，他们在天水相连之处看到了美国孩子的移民船队，两支船队默默地赶着各自的航程，谁也没理谁。\n　　现在，浪小了，为在风浪中采取最安全的迎浪行驶方式，船队已偏离航线行驶了两天，现在整个船队正在试着艰难地转向。雷鸣似的浪击声从船头移向左舷，船体的左右摇摆加剧了。\n　　这时，大洋上空乌云散去，玫瑰星云把光芒撒向洋面，洋浪接住了光芒并把它撕碎，太平洋仿佛变成一片壮观的蓝色火海！孩子们纷纷跑上甲板，晕船和饥饿使他们步履艰难，但他们仍对着眼前壮丽的景象欢呼起来。\n　　今天是十二月三十一日，一九九九年的最后一天，也是公元纪年的最后一天。\n　　刚刚结束的联合国大会上，孩子们同意在明年采用新的人类纪年。\n　　零点到了。\n　　船队中的两艘驱逐舰上的一百五十毫米舰炮响了起来，别的船上也升起了一串串照明弹和焰火，炮声和浪声风声孩子们的欢呼声混为一体，在天空和大洋之间轰响着。\n　　东方已现出第一缕曙光，同玫瑰星云的光芒组成宇宙间最壮丽的色彩。\n　　这是超新星纪元第一年一月一日。\n　　一九九一年十月二日完稿于娘子关\n\n　　小说完成后，第一个问题就是不知把它投给谁，当时我不认识任何出版界的人，对出版社的运作方式也没有最基本的概念。第一个想法就是把它寄给杨潇。由于对科幻世界杂志命运的关注（当时它不叫这个名字），我很早就知道她这个人。自八十年代的那场灾难后，中国科\n######################\nOutput:",
