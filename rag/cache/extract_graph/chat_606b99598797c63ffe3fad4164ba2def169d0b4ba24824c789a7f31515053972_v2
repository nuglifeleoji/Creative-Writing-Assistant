Sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.\nTent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then—silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface.\n“Try the receiver again,” Jessica said.\n“No use,” he said.\nHe found his stillsuit’s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen existence—living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.\nJessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must guard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent’s catchpockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.\nSo much easier to drift back down into sleep.\nBut there had been a dream in this day’s sleep, and she shivered at memory of it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been written: Duke Leto Atreides. The name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.\nThe sand would not stop.\nHer dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing—part of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little more than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.\nMy unknown mother, Jessica thought. The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave me to the Sisters because that’s what she was commanded to do. Was she glad to rid herself of a Harkonnen child?\n“The place to hit them is in the spice,” Paul said.\nHow can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself.\n“An entire planet full of spice,” she said. “How can you hit them there?”\nShe heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor.\n“It was sea power and air power on Caladan,” he said. “Here, it’s desert power. The Fremen are the key.”\nHis voice came from the vicinity of the tent’s sphincter. Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.\nAll his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thought. Now, he finds he is Harkonnen...because of me. How little he knows me! I was my Duke’s only woman. I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene Gesserit orders.\nThe tent’s glowtab came alight under Paul’s hand, filled the domed area with green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desert—forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted. Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away.\n“Secure yourself for the open,” he said, and his voice was blurred behind the filter.\nJessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she watched Paul break the tent seal.\nSand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A\nhole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface.\nWhat will we find out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don’t know?\nShe thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers.\nShe felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter. “Pass up the pack.” It was Paul’s voice, low and\nguarded.\nShe moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.\n“Here,” he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.\nNow she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger Stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.\n“Hurry up,” Paul said. “I want to collapse the tent.”\nA shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. How much sand will the hand hold? she asked herself.\n“Shall | help you?” Paul asked.\n“No.”\nShe swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed sand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took her arm. She stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their basin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther darkness with her trained senses.\nNoise of small animals.\nBirds.\nA fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.\nPaul collapsing their tent, recovering it up the hole.\nStarlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace. She looked at patches of blackness.\nBlack is a blind remembering, she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.\nPresently, Paul stood beside her, said: “Duncan told me that if he was captured, he could hold out... this long. We must leave here now.” He shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert.\nJessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son’s orbit.\nFor now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This world has emptied me of all\nbut the oldest purpose: tomorrow's life. | live now for my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.\nShe felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Paul’s side.\nHe looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.\nThe faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined by stars. The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi- Shaped upthrusting at the stern.\nAn orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare.\nAnother line of purple!\nAnd another upthrusting orange glare!\nIt was like an ancient naval battle, remembered Shellfire, and the sight held them staring.\n“Pillars of fire,” Paul whispered.\nA ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock. Lines of purple laced the sky.\n“Jetflares and lasguns,” Jessica said.\nThe dust-reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their left and they saw a storm trail there—a ribbon of movement over the desert.\n“It must be Harkonnen ‘thopters hunting us,” Paul said. “The way they’re cutting up the desert...it’s as though they were making certain they stamped out whatever’s there...the way you’d stamp out a nest of insects.”\n“Or a nest of Atreides,” Jessica said.\n“We must seek cover,” Paul said. “We’ll head south and keep to the rocks. If they caught us in the\nopen....” He turned, adjusting the pack to his Shoulders. “They’re killing anything that moves.”\nHe took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, heard the low hiss of gliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.\nMy father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. “Something cannot emerge from nothing,” he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable “the truth” can be.\n—FROM “CONVERSATIONS WITH MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad | ‘ve always prided myself on seeing things the\nway they truly are,” Thufir Hawat said. “That’s the curse of being a Mentat. You can’t stop analyzing your data.”\nThe leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke. His sapho-stained lips were drawn into a Straight line with radial creases Spreading upward.\nA robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved by the words.\nThe two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow sink. Dawn was Spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin, touching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and penetrating chill left over from the night. There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him among the few troopers remaining in his force.\nThe man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the sink in the first\nlight of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into the dunes, his movements barely discernible.\nThe Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there. It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. “There are many Harkonnen patrols,” he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.\nHawat nodded.\nMany patrols. Yes.\nBut still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled. Mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.\nThis had been the worst night of Hawat’s life. He had been at Tsimpo, a garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the reports of attack began arriving. At first, he’d thought: /t’s a raid. The Harkonnens are testing.\nBut report followed report—faster and faster.\nTwo legions landed at Carthag.\nFive legions—fifty brigades!—attacking the Duke’s main base at Arrakeen.\nA legion at Arsunt.\nTwo battle groups at Splintered Rock.\nThen the reports became more detailed—there were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers— possibly two legions of them. And it became clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb Intelligence.\nHawat’s shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of his Mentat\ncapabilities. The size of the attack struck his mind like a physical blow.\nNow, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows.\nThe size of the attack.\nHe had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the Guild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of House-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to transport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they’d expected no more than ten brigades.\nBut there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last count—not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_606b99598797c63ffe3fad4164ba2def169d0b4ba24824c789a7f31515053972_v2"}
