神崩溃的，此前，为了满足希恩斯的需要并给自己带来最大的乐趣，这位故事大王穷尽了自己的想象力，把人类的失败描述得尽可能惨重，但现实的残酷还是远超出了他的想象。\n　　当舰队毁灭的影像从二十个天文单位外经过三小时传回地球时，公众的表现就像一群绝望的孩子，世界变成了被噩梦缠绕的幼儿园，群体的精神崩溃现象迅速蔓延，一切都失去了控制。\n　　史强所在的小区里，比他级别高的行政官员要么辞职，要么在崩溃中无所作为，上一级政府紧急任命他接替小区最高行政长官的职务。虽然不是多大的官，但这一冬眠者小区在这场危机中的命运就掌握在他的手中，好在与城市相比，这里的冬眠者社会仍保持着稳定。\n　　“我请大家注意现在的形势，”史强说，“地下城的人工生态系统一旦发生了问题，那儿就成了地狱，里面的人都会拥到地面上来，那样的话这里就不适合生存了。我们应该考虑迁移。”\n　　“向哪儿迁呢？”有人问。\n　　“向人口稀少的地方，比如西北，当然要先派人去考察一下。现在谁也说不好世界会变成什么样，会不会再来一次大低谷，我们得做好完全靠农业生存的准备。”\n　　“水滴会攻击地球吗？”又有人问。\n　　“操那份闲心干什么？”大史摇摇头说，“反正现在谁也拿它没办法，在它把地球撞穿之前，日子还得过，是不是？”\n　　“说得对，操闲心是没用的，我对这点是再清楚不过了。”一直沉默的罗辑说。\n　　人类仅存的七艘太空战舰都在飞离太阳系，它们分成两部分：一部分是“自然选择”号和追击它的舰队，共五艘战舰；另一部分是从水滴大毁灭中幸存的“量子”号和“青铜时代”号。这两支小舰队分别处于太阳系的两端，它们隔着太阳，沿着几乎相反的方向飞向茫茫太空，渐行渐远。\n　　在“自然选择”号上，当章北海听完联合舰队全军覆没的过程汇报后，脸上的表情没有变化，目光仍平静如水，只是淡淡地说了一句：“密集编队是个不可原谅的错误，其他的，都在预料之中。”\n　　“同志们，”章北海的目光越过五位舰长，扫视着由五舰战舰的官兵排成的三层队列，“我对你们用这个古老的称呼，是想说我们所有人今后必须拥有同一个志向。每个人应该明白我们所面对的现实，也应该看到我们将要面对的未来：同志们，我们回不去了。”\n　　是的，回不去了，毁灭了联合舰队的水滴还在太阳系中，另外九个水滴也将于三年后到达，对于这支小舰队，曾经的家园现在是一个死亡陷阱。同时，回去已经没有意义，地球世界的末日已经不远，从收到的信息看，人类文明可能等不到三体主力舰队\n######################\nOutput:",
