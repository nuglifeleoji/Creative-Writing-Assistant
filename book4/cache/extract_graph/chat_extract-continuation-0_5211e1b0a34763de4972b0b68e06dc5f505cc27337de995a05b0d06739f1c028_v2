手里拿着纸做的假花；没有假花的分别在自家的院子里折了一把桃花或杏花。一旦领导人们走过哭咽河的小桥，他们就准备连喊带跳摇动花束表示欢迎。学校大院里已经有了不少没“任务”的村民。大家纷纷转悠着看这摸那，议论的中心话题当然是孙少安干下的这不同凡响的“伟业”。 \n　　贺凤英正领着几个妇女，拿一块红绸子被面，往校舍中间大墙上的一块黑色碑石上蒙盖。这块碑石记述了孙少安新建本学校的经过和情况。因为这是全县第一个由农民个人出资办教育事业，所以县宣传部和教育局都很重视，请文言文功底很深的县文化馆长亲自撰写了碑文；并由石圪节著名的匠人雕刻在碑石上。这可以看作是孙少安夫妇的一块人生纪念碑。 \n　　今天在碑石上蒙红绸子的主意也出自玉亭。他说到时作为“压轴戏”由县领导和少安夫妇亲自揭碑。只是当下急忙找不到单纯的红绸布。玉亭曾建议用当年农业学大寨时的上级奖给双水村的锦旗——把有字的一面压在里面，反蒙到碑石上。结果遭到秀莲的反对，生病的秀莲特别看重今天这个显示他们活人价值的仪式，不让二爸用不三不四的东西蒙盖那个神圣的东西。她咳嗽气喘翻了半天箱柜，拿出了这块红绸被面。她或许已经忘记了，这块被面还是当年她和少安结婚时，润叶送给他们的。 \n　　现在，这块结婚礼品被贺凤英等人庄严地蒙在了碑石上。 \n　　在金家湾这面诸事齐备的时候，田家圪崂那面的公路上传来了热闹的锣鼓声。孙玉亭为了烘托气氛，即兴决定把正月里的秧歌队拉起来了。等乡县领导人一到，就由秧歌队在前领头，从公路上一直迎过庙坪；而在金家湾学校那边，又有学生娃们欢迎队伍——那阵势就很有些蔚为壮观了。 \n　　这阵儿，田五已经腰扭得象摆杨柳，手中伞头转得团团飞旋。几十个男女青年紧跟其后，披红挂绿，甩胳膊扬腿，在公路上预演开了。前一队饲养员，田五他哥田四也捺不住性子，耳朵上拴了两个棉花蛋，装扮成“蛮婆”跟在秧歌队尾拧晃起来，其丢丑神韵足可以和罐子村的王满银相比。在众人的哄笑声中，已故田二的憨小子田牛也手舞足蹈跑到队伍中捣乱去了。在大乐器那边的人堆里，巫神刘玉升接班人田平娃在打鼓。他师傅不会\n######################\nOutput:",
