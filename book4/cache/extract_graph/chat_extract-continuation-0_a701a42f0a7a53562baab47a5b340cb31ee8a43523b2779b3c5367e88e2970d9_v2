\n　　孙玉厚才又反应过来，这次借债和少安结婚借债不一样——这是借本赚利呢！ \n　　不过，他还是忧心忡忡地对儿子说：“这可是一笔大钱！我借钱借怕了，谁知道这事里有没有凶险？另外，几百块钱你向谁借？” \n　　少安再不言语了。他能向谁借这几百块钱呢？他长叹了一口气，把烟屁股一丢，双臂抱住膝盖，深深地埋下了头，他只听见父亲在他旁边“叭、叭”地使劲吸烟。在一片沉寂中，远处东拉河的河道里，传来一声牛的哞叫。 \n　　天色暗下来了。 \n　　过了一会，少安抬起头，对父亲说：“那我明天给根民捎个话，让他另找别人揽这活去。” \n　　父亲无可奈何地说：“就叫人家干吧。没有金刚钻，揽不了磁器活……” \n　　孙少安回到饲养院那边的家里后，秀莲已经躺在被窝里，但还没有入睡，灯一直点着。 \n　　少安一边脱衣服，一边对她说：“你怎睡下还点灯熬油呢？” \n　　“我一个人怕……”妻子说。 \n　　和秀莲躺在一块的时候，少安仍然为丢了有生以来最大的一笔收入而忍不住叹息起来。 \n　　秀莲警觉地瞪起一对大花眼睛，问丈夫：“你怎么啦？”少安于是又把拉砖的事给妻子说了一遍。 \n　　秀莲听他说完，在被窝里抬起半个光身子，高兴地说：“如果能赚这么大一笔钱，那咱们不光能打土窑，就是硬箍几孔石窑洞也够了！” \n　　她一下又想到她的“主题”上了。 \n　　少安亲昵地把妻子扳倒在被窝里，说：“你看你！小心凉了……这都是空说哩！什么地方去借那几百块钱买牲畜？” \n　　兴奋的秀莲又一次爬起来，两只手托在丈夫结实的胸脯上，说：“这事你别熬煎！咱们给山西我爸写个信，让他想办法给咱转借这钱！我知道哩，我姐夫手头有点积攒哩！” \n　　少安听秀莲这么一说，也一闪身从被窝里坐起来，说：“这门路倒能试一下！” \n　　夫妻两个于是光身子坐在被窝里，商量开了从秀莲娘家那里借钱的事。 \n　　“干脆！咱现在就给家里写信，明天就邮出去！”性急的秀莲说着，便身上一条线不挂跳下炕，从对面的土台子上找出少安上学时的那支烂杆钢笔，又把兰香作业本后面写剩的几张白纸撕下来。她回到炕上，把煤油灯往被窝旁边\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
