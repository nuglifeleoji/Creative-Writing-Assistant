不堪的身子，来到井口下面，等待上罐。所有的人脸上看不见一丝笑影，也不说任何话。身上都象墨汁泼过，只有从眼白辨认出这是一群活物。 \n　　少平最后一罐上井。 \n　　当罐笼在井口停下以后，他一下子惊呆了。 \n　　他看见：晓霞正微笑着立在井口！ \n　　少平以为是强烈的阳光刺花了眼，使他产生了幻觉。他赶忙眨巴了几下眼睛，却再一次看清这的确是晓霞啊！她正脑袋转来转去，显然是在寻找他——在这群黑人中找个熟人是不太容易。 \n　　他是在不知不觉中被大家拥挤出罐笼的。他这时才发现，连同先前上井的工人，大家都没有离开井口周围，呆立在旁边有点震惊而诧异地观看晓霞。是呀，谁也反应不过来，在这个女人从不涉足的地方，怎么突然会降落这么个仙女呢？晓霞是太引人注目了，尤其是这样一个特殊的环境里。她已经穿起了裙子，两条赤裸而修长的腿从天蓝色的裙摆中伸出，象刚出水的藕。一根细细的黑色皮带将雪白的衬衫束在裙中。脸庞在六月的阳光下象鲜花般绚丽。 \n　　现在，晓霞认出了他。 \n　　她立刻激动地走过来，立在他面前，看来一时不知该说什么是好。 \n　　亲爱的人！你不会想到，你此刻看见的是这样一个孙少平吧？他又脏又黑，象刚从地狱里爬出来的鬼魂。 \n　　泪水不知什么时间悄悄涌出了他的眼睛，在染满煤尘的脸颊上静静流淌。这热的河流淌过黑色大地，淌过六月金黄的阳光，澎湃激荡地拍打她的胸膛，一直涌向她的心间……她仍然连一句话也说不出来，胸前的山脉在起伏着。他用黑手抹了一把脸上的泪水，使得那张脸更肮脏不堪。他说：“你先到外面等一等，我洗个澡就来了！”他不能忍受井口那一群粗鲁的伙伴这样来“观赏”她。 \n　　晓霞笑着转身就走。她眼中也有泪花在闪烁。 \n　　孙少平匆匆忙忙而又糊里糊涂穿过暗道，把灯盒子“啪”地扔进矿灯房，就冲上了三楼的浴池。 \n　　他十分钟就洗完澡，把干净衣服一换，急速地跑出了大楼。 \n　　她正在门口等他。 \n　　相视一笑。 \n　　无言中表达了双方万千心绪。 \n　　“我在招待所住……咱们走吧！”她轻轻对他说。 \n　　他点点头，两个人就肩并肩相跟着向半山坡的矿招待所走去。少平感到，一路上，所有的人都对着他笑。怎么晓霞也对着他笑？笑什么？他都被人笑得走不成路了！ \n　　到招待所，进\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHAO
