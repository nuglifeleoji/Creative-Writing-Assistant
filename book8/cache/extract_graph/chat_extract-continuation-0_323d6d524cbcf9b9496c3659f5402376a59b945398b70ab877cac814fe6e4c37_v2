足足玩了一个小时，也不见蓝轩宇疲倦。还是南澄叫停，他这才去睡了。\n\n    “你儿子看来真要变成天才了，咋办？”南澄依偎在蓝潇怀中，有些无奈的说道。\n\n    蓝潇轻叹一声，“虽然我也不想让他被注意，可我们也不能压制他的成长，不是吗？一切顺其自然吧。不过，按照他精神力提升的速度，再加上对水元素的控制能力。应该给他在学校之外再找个老师或者是补习班才行了。多参加一些实战演练会对他有帮助。幸好，他的魂力提升速度依旧比较慢。应该很快就会被同龄的孩子超过，才没有那么显眼吧。”\n\n    “等回去看看吧。补习老师也不好找，而且价格不菲呢。我们的经济上承担起来虽然也还行，但生活质量恐怕要下降一些了。”\n\n    蓝潇微微一笑，道：“这些不用你担心。上面有意愿让我去参与星际探索，寻找下一颗行政星，我打算去试试。据说已经发现的这颗行政星，很可能有类似于我们母星远古时代魂兽似的生物。这次探索如果有所成绩，回来之后我应该也能升值加薪了。”\n\n    南澄有些紧张的抓着他的手，“会不会有危险啊？”\n\n    蓝潇失笑道：“你这是关心则乱啊！联邦探索宇宙已经有几千年的历史了，每次都是做足了准备工作，你什么时候见过危险出现了？更何况我也只是后勤保障人员，只是负责一些数据分析、基因对比之类。不会有什么风险的。”\n\n    南澄道：“那要去多久？”\n\n    蓝潇道：“这正是我要跟你说的，恐怕要至少三个月到半年的时间。就是这时间有点长。不过现在星际远程信号通讯技术已经完善了，至少每周我们可以通话一次。”\n\n    南澄搂紧丈夫，“我有点舍不得你去。要不，我调到别的部门去吧。以我魂帝的修为，如果尝试一些主战部门，应该工资会提高很多呢。”\n\n    “不行。我可是很大男子主义的。哪有让老婆出去多赚钱的。你要考虑我的自尊心哦。”蓝潇似笑非笑的说道。\n\n    南澄把头埋在他怀中，“那你什么时候走？”\n\n    蓝潇道：“如果你同意的话，回去之后我就在申请书上签字了。然后等上面的消息。按照之前给我的资料来看，应该很快。探索舰队很需要我这样的研究人员。而且，这次有不少补助，都是先发放的。给儿子找家庭老师足够了。”\n\n    “让我再想想，回去再说吧。”\n------------\n\n第三十一章 斗铠手办\n\n    娜娜呆呆的坐在自己的房间之中。发呆才是她的日常。也是打发时间最好的办法。而绝大多数的时候，她发呆时大脑都是一片空白。没有回忆，没有思考，就是那么简单的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
