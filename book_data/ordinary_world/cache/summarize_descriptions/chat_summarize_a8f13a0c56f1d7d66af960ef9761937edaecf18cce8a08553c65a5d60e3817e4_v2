However, as the situation unfolds, he comes to appreciate 润叶's perspective and ultimately agrees with her stance. Throughout this process, 李登云 is taken aback by 润叶's unwavering support for 向前, which fosters a sense of gratitude within him. He listens attentively to 润叶's reasoning, particularly regarding the importance of supporting her husband in his new career path, which helps him understand her viewpoint better.\n\nIn addition to these dynamics, 李登云's family expresses interest in the possibility of marrying their son, 向前, to 润叶. This interest indicates a deeper connection forming between the families, suggesting that despite initial disagreements, there is potential for a strong familial bond to develop through their children's relationship.
