第1章\n　　１９７５年二、三月间，一个平平常常的日子，细蒙蒙的雨丝夹着一星半点的雪花，正纷纷淋淋地向大地飘洒着。时令已快到惊蛰，雪当然再不会存留，往往还没等落地，就已经消失得无踪无影了。黄土高原严寒而漫长的冬天看来就要过去，但那真正温暖的春天还远远地没有到来。 \n　　在这样雨雪交加的日子里，如果没有什么紧要事，人们宁愿一整天足不出户。因此，县城的大街小巷倒也比平时少了许多嘈杂。街巷背阴的地方。冬天残留的积雪和冰溜子正在雨点的敲击下蚀化，石板街上到处都漫流着肮脏的污水。风依然是寒冷的。空荡荡的街道上，有时会偶尔走过来一个乡下人，破毡帽护着脑门，胳膊上挽一筐子土豆或萝卜，有气无力地呼唤着买主。唉，城市在这样的日子里完全丧失了生气，变得没有一点可爱之处了。 \n　　只有在半山腰县立高中的大院坝里，此刻却自有一番热闹景象。午饭铃声刚刚响过，从一排排高低错落的石窑洞里，就跑出来了一群一伙的男男女女。他们把碗筷敲得震天价响，踏泥带水、叫叫嚷嚷地跑过院坝，向南面总务处那一排窑洞的墙根下蜂涌而去。偌大一个院子，霎时就被这纷乱的人群踩踏成了一片烂泥滩。与此同时，那些家在本城的走读生们，也正三三两两涌出东面学校的大门。他们撑着雨伞，一路说说笑笑，通过一段早年间用横石片插起的长长的下坡路，不多时便纷纷消失在城市的大街小巷中。 \n　　在校园内的南墙根下，现在已经按班级排起了十几路纵队。各班的值日生正在忙碌地给众人分饭菜。每个人的饭菜都是昨天登记好并付了饭票的，因此程序并不复杂，现在值日生只是按饭表付给每人预订的一份。菜分甲、乙、丙三等。甲菜以土豆、白菜、粉条为主，里面有些叫人嘴馋的大肉片，每份三毛钱；乙菜其它内容和甲菜一样，只是没有肉，每份一毛五分钱。丙菜可就差远了，清水煮白萝卜——似乎只是为了掩饰这过分的清淡，才在里面象征性地漂了几点辣子油花。不过，这菜价钱倒也便宜，每份五分钱。 \n　　各班的甲菜只是在小脸盆里盛一点，看来吃得起肉菜的学生没有几个。丙菜也用小脸盆盛一点，说明吃这种下等伙食的人也没有多少。只有乙菜各班都用烧瓷大脚盆盛着，海海漫漫的，显然大部分人都吃这种既不奢侈\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
