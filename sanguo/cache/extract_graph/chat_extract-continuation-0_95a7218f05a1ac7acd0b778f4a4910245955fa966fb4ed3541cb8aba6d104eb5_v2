   次日，姜维尽拔九寨之兵，分布于祁山之前。司马望引兵离了渭南，径到祁山之前，出马与姜维答话。维曰：“汝请吾斗阵法，汝先布与吾看。”望布成了八卦。维笑曰：“此即吾所布八阵之法也，汝今盗袭，何足为奇！”望曰：“汝亦窃他人之法耳！”维曰：“此阵凡有几变？”望笑曰：“吾既能布，岂不会变？此阵有九九八十一变。”维笑曰：“汝试变来。”望入阵变了数番，复出阵曰：“汝识吾变否？”维笑曰：“吾阵法按周天三百六十五变。汝乃井底之蛙，安知玄奥乎！”望自知有此变法，实不曾学全，乃勉强折辩曰：“吾不信，汝试变来。”维曰：“汝教邓艾出来，吾当布与他看。”望曰：“邓将军自有良谋，不好阵法。”维大笑曰：“有何良谋！不过教汝赚吾在此布阵，他却引兵袭吾山后耳！”望大惊，恰欲进兵混战，被维以鞭梢一指，两翼兵先出，杀的那魏兵弃甲抛戈，各逃性命。却说邓艾催督先锋郑伦来袭山后。伦刚转过山角，忽然一声炮响，鼓角喧天，伏兵杀出：为首大将。乃廖化也。二人未及答话，两马交处，被廖化一刀，斩郑伦于马下。邓艾大惊，急勒兵退时，张翼引一军杀到。两下夹攻，魏兵大败。艾舍命突出，身被四箭。奔到谓南寨时，司马望亦到。二人商议退兵之策。望曰：“近日蜀主刘禅，宠幸中贵黄皓，日夜以酒色为乐。可用反间计召回姜维，此危可解。”艾问众\n######################\nOutput:",
