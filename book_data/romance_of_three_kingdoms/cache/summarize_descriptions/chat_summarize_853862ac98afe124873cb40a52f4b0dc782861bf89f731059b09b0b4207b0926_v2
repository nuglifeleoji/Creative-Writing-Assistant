This revered artifact was traditionally passed down through various ruling families, embodying the power and sovereignty of the emperor. Its importance is underscored by its role in legitimizing the rule of the dynasty that possessed it.\n\nIn a notable historical event, the 玉玺 was seized by 徐璆 and subsequently presented to 曹操, a prominent warlord and statesman during the late Eastern Han dynasty. This act not only highlights the seal's value as a political tool but also illustrates the tumultuous power dynamics of the time, where control over the 玉玺 could significantly influence one's claim to authority.\n\nOverall, the 玉玺 represents a critical element of imperial power in China, serving as a tangible connection to the legitimacy of the ruling authority and the continuity of dynastic rule. Its legacy continues to be a symbol of governance and imperial heritage in Chinese history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754984039, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
