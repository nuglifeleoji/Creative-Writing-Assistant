比之上次蓝轩宇在面对这一击的时候，此时的黄金狮子吼威力无疑又要大的多了，凭借着两环修为的支持，吕千寻的黄金狮子吼爆发出恐怖威力，哪怕是远处的钱磊都随之受到了影响。\n\n    可是，已经近在咫尺的蓝轩宇，整个人却像是凝固在了那里似的。然后，吕千寻、叶灵瞳和常剑逸就看到，在他合握的双手之中，一点彩光迸射而出。\n\n    而在那彩光缭绕之中，蓝轩宇就像根本没有受到黄金狮子吼影响半分，只是微笑的看着他们三人，嘴唇嗡动，似乎说了两个字：再见！\n\n    下一瞬，惊天彩光瞬间绽放，在空中化为一个直径五米的彩色光球，将蓝轩宇自己、吕千寻、叶灵瞳和常剑逸全部笼罩其中。\n\n    一切发生的实在是太快了，从蓝轩宇双手合握，到黄金狮子吼爆发，再到这彩光绽放，整个过程也只是一眨眼的工夫。\n\n    刚刚释放出来的黄金狮子吼就像是被掐住了脖子一般嘎然而止。\n\n    彩光足足持续了数秒时间才渐渐收歇。蓝轩宇、吕千寻、叶灵瞳、常剑逸，四人全部消失。\n\n    擂台之上，只剩下摔的七荤八素的刘锋和目瞪口呆的钱磊。\n\n    三三三寝室，胜利！第五场！\n\n    观测屏幕前，老师们一片鸦雀无声。\n\n    谁能预料到，会是这样的结果？\n\n    银天凡和季洪彬又何尝不是目瞪口呆？\n\n    他们只是想要压迫一下蓝轩宇他们，看看他们有多少潜能没发挥出来，可谁曾想却直接压迫出来一个大的，那彩光是什么玩意儿？以至于两环修为的吕千寻，再加上实力不弱的叶灵瞳和常剑逸，根本就没发挥出自己的实力，直接被秒杀了、秒杀了、秒杀了……\n\n    这是一环魂师能使用出来的能力？范围覆盖直径五米，而且攻击力明显极为强悍，这究竟是个什么情况？\n\n    “舍身技还是武魂融合技？”银天凡有些僵硬的转向旁边的季洪彬问道。在魂师魂技方面，季洪彬无疑比他懂得更多。\n\n    季洪彬嘴角抽搐了一下，“不可能是舍身技，从蓝轩宇刚刚使用时的从容就能看出，他以前一定是用过的。这个技能应该耗掉了他全部精力，所以才会被系统默认死亡，离开战场。但应该不会真死，因为他以前必定也尝试过了，要不也不会在这个时候用出来。刘锋的主动出击，不惜代价的应该是为了让吕千寻三人不分开，给他制造这秒杀的机会。所以，我觉得是武魂融合技，自体武魂融合技……”\n######################\nOutput:",
