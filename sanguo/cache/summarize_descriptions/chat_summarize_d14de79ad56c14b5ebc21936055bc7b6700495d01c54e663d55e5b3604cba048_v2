He initially arrives with an army from 陕西, seeking to negotiate peace among the opposing factions during a tumultuous period marked by civil strife. As a supporter of 董卓, 张济 actively participates in various military actions, aligning himself with the political maneuvers of the time.\n\nThroughout his career, 张济 is noted for attending a banquet hosted by 李傕, where he witnesses the execution of 樊稠, an event that underscores the brutal nature of the power struggles during this era. His association with 李傕 is further highlighted by his decision to flee to 陕西 alongside him and other allies, indicating a strategic retreat in response to the shifting dynamics of power.\n\nUltimately, 张济's death holds significant implications within the context of the ongoing conflicts of the late Han dynasty, marking the end of his influence and the impact of his military actions on the broader historical landscape.
