\n　　她象受伤的母牛一般，几乎是小跑着转到公路上，在黎明中出了寂静无声的到罐子村，向石圪节公社走去——她要向公家告那个不要脸的“南洋女人”。 \n　　当兰花气喘吁吁地进了公社院子的时候，公家人刚刚吃完了早饭。公社干部过春节后大部分还没有回来，只有文书和主任涂治功。 \n　　兰花一进徐治功的办公室，就鼻子一把泪一把向主任叙说起了她的苦情。 \n　　徐治功几乎一直笑着听这位农村妇女说完她的不幸。他喷了一口烟，说：“现在这社会，这号事不算事！我们管不了” \n　　“你们连坏人也不管了？”兰花瞪着红肿的眼睛，问徐主任。 \n　　“那你写状子告嘛！”徐主任仍然笑着说。 \n　　“我不识字。”兰花难住了。 \n　　“那你找个人写嘛！” \n　　“你给我找个人……” \n　　“这又不是我的事！”徐治功不耐烦地说，“我把这号事也管了，其它大事谁管呀？” \n　　“你不找个人，我就住在你这里不走！”创伤深重的兰花也不顾一切了。 \n　　“咦呀，你给我耍起了赖！”徐治功叫道。 \n　　“我就不走！”兰花说完，竟然放开声嚎了起来。 \n　　心烦意乱的徐治功只好把公社文书叫来，对他挤挤眼：“你去给她代写个状子！” \n　　文书对主任会意地点点头，便劝说兰花不要哭，跟他到隔壁窑洞写状子。 \n　　兰花立刻顺从地跟文书别了隔壁；接着又向这位年轻的公家人叙说了一遍“南洋女人”和她丈夫的长长短短。不一会，徐主任过来了，声色俱厉地对文书说：“你带两个民兵，立刻到罐子村去，把王银满和那个女人捆到公社来！”文书马上站起来，说：“我这就去！” \n　　兰花瞪大眼，喊叫说：“怎连我男人也绑呀？”徐治功说：“怎不绑你男人？这号事主要是整治男的！”“那不能！”可怜的女人叫道，“我是来叫你们光把那个女人撵跑……” \n　　徐治功对文书挤挤眼：“快去吧！把王满银绑紧些！” \n　　文书一本正经正准备往门外去，兰花一扑起来，从文书手里夺回“状子”，说：“你们不要去，我不告了！” \n　　她说完，便很快起身出了公社大门。徐治功和文书站在门台阶上张开嘴只是个笑。 \n　　可怜的兰花出了石圪节，又折转身往家里走。她原指望公家把那个坏女人赶跑就行了，结果公家要把她男人一齐绑走。她舍不得让男人受罪……当她痛不欲生地返回家里\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
