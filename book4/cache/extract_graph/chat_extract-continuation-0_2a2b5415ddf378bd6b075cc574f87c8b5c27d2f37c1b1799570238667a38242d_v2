\n　　一个她说：不能答应这门亲事！因为你不爱向前！你爱的人是孙少安！ \n　　可另一个她又劝说这个她：少安早已经结婚了，你一生也许不会再碰上一个称心如意的人。你最终如果还要和一个自己不满意的人结婚，那还不如就把这门亲事应承下来。这样，你还能给二爸解个围……润叶干脆不再回学校去了。她把棉大衣放在炕上，一个人背靠着炕拦石，站在脚地上思考着这事，脑子象钻进去一群蚊子，嗡嗡直响。 \n　　她开始动摇了。她的力量使她无法支撑如此巨大的精神压力。当然，除过客观的压力以外，她主观上的素养本来也不够深厚。是的，她现在还不能从更高意义上来理解自身和社会。尽管她是一个正直善良的人，懂事，甚至也有较鲜明的个性，但并不具有深刻的思想和广阔的眼界。因此，最终她还是不能掌握自己的命运。 \n　　于是，她的所有局限性就导致她做出了违背自己心愿的决定：由于对爱情的绝望，加上对二爸的热爱，她最后终于答应了这门亲事…… \n　　徐国强老汉一获知润叶同意和向前结婚，立刻迫不及待地亲自去了一趟李登云的家，把喜讯传给了这家的三口人。 \n　　李登云一家马上喜出望外，紧急动员起来，开始备办婚礼了。向前结婚的东西实际上早已经准备停当，搁在两个大木箱中。现在只是该裁的裁，该缝的缝，该整理的整理；缺什么东西赶快出动去买！ \n　　街上缝纫社两个手艺最好的师傅第二天就进了李主任家。刘志英班也不上了，带着从农村叫来的亲戚忙着里外料理。李登云和儿子一块合计：婚礼该请些什么客人；一共得多少人；几桌饭；多少瓶酒；几箱烟；在什么地方举行；要不要动用车辆；要动用得多少辆……另外，得给女方置办什么东西？润叶需要给买些什么？还有田福军、徐爱云、徐国强；爱云的女儿田晓霞和在省城上学的晓霞她哥田晓光……看来这后一项事宜一会还得向向前妈请示，他父子俩决定不了！ \n　　与此同时，这面的徐爱云也忙活起来了。她紧急地动手准备出嫁侄女的装备。遗撼的是，福军不在家，她爸人又老了，没人给她帮忙。跟前有个晓霞，上学不说，又是个疯丫头——她才不管这号事呢！ \n　　对！赶快让大哥来！真是的，润叶是他的亲生女儿，这时候他不忙让谁忙！\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
