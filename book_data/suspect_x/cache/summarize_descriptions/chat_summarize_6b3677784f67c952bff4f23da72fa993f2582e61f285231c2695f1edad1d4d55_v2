The desert is notably traversed by **Odrade** and **Sheeana**, who journeyed across its expanse aboard a sandworm, highlighting its connection to the planet's ecological and cultural heritage.  \n\nRemnants of an ancient wall can be found within the Sareer, suggesting a long-lost civilization or defensive structure that once stood in the region. This feature adds to the desert's mystique, hinting at a deeper historical narrative beyond its role as a barren wasteland.  \n\nThe Sareer's dual identity—as both a sacred space tied to the God Emperor's reign and a proving ground for those who dare to cross it—underscores its importance in the broader lore of Rakis.
