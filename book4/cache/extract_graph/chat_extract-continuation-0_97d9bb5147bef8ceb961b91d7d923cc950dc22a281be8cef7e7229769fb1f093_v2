\n　　眼睛！眼睛为什么看不见……噢，是蒙着什么东西。眼睛很疼。头很疼。怎么没听见惠英的声音？明明呢？耳朵不疼！应该听见些什么……怎么这样静啊？人呢？世界上为什么突然没有了声音？ \n　　他并不知道这是在深深的夜晚。 \n　　他挣扎着动了一下，并且叫了一声：“惠英嫂……”“哥哥！” \n　　他听见旁边传来一个女孩子的声音。 \n　　哥哥？这是兰香？ \n　　“兰香！”他叫道，并且伸出一只手，试图抓住她的手。一只小巧的手紧紧握住了他的手。 \n　　“哥哥，我是金秀！” \n　　“秀？” \n　　“噢！” \n　　“我……在哪儿？” \n　　“你在省附属医院……” \n　　“我……要紧吗？” \n　　“不要紧！哥哥，你放心！” \n　　他亲切地握了握金秀的手，同时感到有两颗烫热的泪珠滴在了他的手背上…… \n                  第52章\n　　生活中的某种巧合常常使人感到象是天意的安排。金秀怎么能想到，她在这样一个地方和少平哥相遇呢？当她面对受伤的少平时，心中不知是喜还是悲！喜的是，她这样意外地见到了他。悲的是，她见到的是一个受了重伤的孙少平。 \n　　悲喜交加的金秀现在既顾不上喜，也顾不上悲；她要全神贯注、全力以赴护理好亲爱的少平哥哥。也许这的确是一种天意的安排，使她有机会能以这样一种方式接近他……不用说，金秀太熟悉躺在眼前的这个人了。在她童年和少年的全部生活中，他都是她周围少数几个最亲近的人。他是她哥金波的朋友；是她的朋友兰香的哥哥。他们两家人一直亲密无间地生活在双水村，每个人都象自家人一样可亲。 \n　　可是虽然如此，由于年龄的差别，以前她和少平哥之间犹如隔辈之人，不象她和兰香那样交往自如。从她记事开始，她就一直把少平看作是大人，而自己在他面前永远是个小孩子。 \n　　直到她自己感觉到自己也长成了大人后，细细一盘算，才有点惊讶地“发现”：少平哥只比她大四岁呀！ \n　　他们实际上是同代人。只因为少平哥成熟早，她才老早把他看成大人自己好象一直是小孩。就是现在，她也很难完全把这种心理调整过来。自从她考上大学来到大城市，进入另一个生活世界以后，双水村，石圪节，原西城，以及过去生活中亲近的人，似乎渐渐变得遥远而模糊了。新的天地和新的人物占据了她的生活。与此同时，她也告别了孩子时代，进入了成年人的行列。这种急速的变化，使人马上感到过去十几年的一切都成为久远的历史，�\n######################\nOutput:",
