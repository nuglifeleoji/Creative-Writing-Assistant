\n　　晓霞对他说：“这是常委院。”她又指了指旁边一座四层楼，“那是地委家属楼，我们在一单元二楼左手……这样吧，咱们不回家了，在我爸的办公室里好拉话。我爸昨天去了原东县，还没回来……” \n　　常委院是一排做工精细的大石窑洞，三面围墙，有个小门通向家属楼。院子里有几座小花坛，其间的花朵大都已凋谢，竟奇迹般留了一朵红艳艳的玫瑰。墙边的几棵梧桐树下，积了厚厚一层黄叶。 \n　　晓霞收了雨伞，从身上掏出钥匙，打开了中间一孔窑洞的门。她揭起门帘，把少平让进去。 \n　　窑洞面积很大，两孔套在一起；刚进门的这孔显然是办公室，从墙中间的一个小过洞里穿过去，便是书房兼卧室了。她引着他进了里间。 \n　　他拘谨地坐在沙发里，环视着这个非凡的地方。晓霞忙着为他倒茶、削苹果。 \n　　少平在对面墙上的穿衣镜里，看见自己穿着一身烂衣服头发乱得象一团沙蓬，坐在这舒适的全包沙发里，实在有点滑稽。如果不是晓霞在，进来个生人看见他这副样，会以为是个图谋不轨的歹徒呢！ \n　　晓霞把一颗削好的苹果递到他手里，然后也坐在旁边的沙发里，开始询问他这两年的情况。 \n　　少平这才一边吃苹果，一边打开了话匣子，如实地向晓霞叙说他的经历和目前的状况。 \n　　在少平说话的时候，晓霞瞪着一双美丽而惊讶的眼睛，聚精会神地听着。 \n　　少平说完后，晓霞象木雕一般呆坐在沙发里，不再发问，也不再说话。 \n　　少平也沉默了一会。然后他信任地对她说：“你不要对任何熟人或咱们的同学说起我的情况。我知道你能理解我，我才对你说了实情。不愿意我目前的真实情况让别人知道。要是传回原西，我父母一定会着急的。我希望在老人的想象中，我在黄原的一切都是美好的。咱们同学之中，除过金波，谁也不知道我现在的情况；我也不愿意让他们知道。这不是因为虚荣，而是不愿遭受虚荣者的嘲笑；我想默默地、宁静地走自己的路…… \n　　“你得向我保证这一点！”少平强调说。 \n　　晓霞象是从梦中惊醒，随口说：“这你放心！”她站起来，“先不说了，让我去买饭！咱们就不回我家里吃了，我知道你在我家里吃饭不自在。我到大灶上去买……” \n　　晓霞从框子里拿出碗筷，又在桌子抽屉里抓了一把饭票，就很快出去了。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
