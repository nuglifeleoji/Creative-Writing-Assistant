But all of these are as nothing....” She closed her fingers into a fist. “...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!”\nA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat’s puzzled frown.\n“Where were you woolgathering that time?” Hawat asked.\n“Did you meet the Reverend Mother?”\n“That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?” Hawat’s eyes quickened with interest. “I met her.”\n“She....” Paul hesitated, found that he couldn’t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.\n“Yes? What did she?”\nPaul took two deep breaths. “She said a thing.” He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman ’s tone: “‘You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It’s something none of your ancestors learned.’” Paul opened his eyes, said: “That made me angry and | said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, ‘He’s losing it.’ And | said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said, ‘He’ll lose that one, too.’ And | wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he’d already been warned—by you, by Mother, by many people.”\n“True enough,” Hawat muttered.\n“Then why’re we going?” Paul demanded.\n“Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there’s hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?”\nPaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he thought. How?\n“She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,” Paul said. “And | said that one commands. And she said | had some unlearning to do.”\nShe hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.\n“She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.”\n“How'd she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?” Hawat asked.\nPaul shrugged. “Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world’s language, that it’s different for every world. And | thought she meant they didn’t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn’t it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don’t hear just with your ears. And | said that’s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.”\nHawat chuckled. “How’d that sit with her?”\n“I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So | quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: ‘A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.” That seemed to satisfy her.”\nHe seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?\n“Thufir,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as bad as she said?”\n“Nothing could be that bad,” Hawat said and forced a smile. “Take those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, | can tell you there're many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and....” Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. “...they hate Harkonnens with a\nbloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. | tell you only as your father’s helper.”\n“My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,” Paul said. “Do you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis...perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.”\n“We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,” Hawat said. “Only what it was like long ago... mostly. But what is known—you’re right on that score.”\n“Will the Fremen help us?”\n“It’s a possibility.” Hawat stood up. “I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who’s fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It’s not that | think there’s any danger in the castle; it’s just a habit | want you to form.”\nPaul got to his feet, moved around the table. “You're going today?”\n“Today it is, and you'll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it’ll be on the soil of your new world.” He gripped Paul’s right arm at the bicep. “Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.” He released the arm, patted Paul’s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\n“Thufir!” Paul called.\nHawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\n“Don’t sit with your back to any doors,” Paul said.\nA grin spread across the seamed old face. “That | won't, lad. Depend on it.” And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.\nPaul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day here, he\nthought. He looked around the room. We're leaving. The idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things—the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns—the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense of the now. And he wondered: What is the now?\nThe door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons.\n“Well, Gurney Halleck,” Paul called, “are you the new weapons master?”\nHalleck kicked the door shut with one heel. “You'd rather | came to play games, | know,” he said. He glanced around the room, noting that Hawat’s men already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke’s heir. The subtle code signs were all around.\nPaul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung over Gurney’s shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard.\nHalleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up—the rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across the room.\n“So you don’t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,” Halleck said. “And what barb did you\nsink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemy’s funeral.”\nPaul grinned. Of all his father’s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew the man’s moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword.\nHalleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. “If y’ won’t talk, y’ won't,” he said.\nPaul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: “Well, Gurney, do we come prepared for music when it’s fighting time?”\n“So it’s sass for our elders today,” Halleck said. He tried a chord on the instrument, nodded.\n“Where’s Duncan Idaho?” Paul asked. “Isn’t he Supposed to be teaching me weaponry?”\n“Duncan’s gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,” Halleck said. “All you have left is poor Gurney who’s fresh out of fight and spoiling for music.” He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. “And it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we’d best teach you the music trade so’s you won’t waste your life entire.”\n“Maybe you'd better sing me a lay then,” Paul said. “I want to be sure how not to do it.”\n“Ah-h-h, hah!” Gurney laughed, and he swung into “Galacian Girls,” his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:\n“Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls Will do it for pearls,\nAnd the Arrakeen for water! But if you desire dames\nLike consuming flames, Try a Caladanin daughter!”\n“Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick,” Paul said, “but if my mother heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she’d have your ears on the outer wall for decoration.”\nGurney pulled at his left ear. “Poor decoration, too, they having been bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad | know practiced some Strange ditties on his baliset.”\n“So you've forgotten what it’s like to find sand in your bed,” Paul said. He pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. “Then, let’s fight!”\nHalleck’s eyes went wide in mock surprise. “So! It was your wicked hand did that deed! Guard yourself today, young master—guard yourself.” He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. “I’m a hellfiend out for revenge!”\nPaul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the agui/e, one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.\n“What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,” Paul intoned. “This doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded.” Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. “In shield fighting, one moves fast on\ndefense, slow on attack,” Paul said. “Attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!” Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a Slow thrust timed to enter a shield’s mindless defenses.\nHalleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest. “Speed, excellent,” he said. “But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.”\nPaul stepped back, chagrined.\n“I should whap your backside for such carelessness,” Halle\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_875dd8d2b142fd4ba2deeceaec5a564153c10c4bb8e44371cccc8b701dcb8cf9_v2"}
