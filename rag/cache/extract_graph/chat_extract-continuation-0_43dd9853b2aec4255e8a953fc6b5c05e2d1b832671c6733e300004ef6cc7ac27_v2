Slowly, he straightened and only then did he look down at himself. Presently, he lifted his attention to his left arm held in front of him. His gaze went to the ceiling, to each wall in turn. Again, he looked at his body.\n“What in the nether hell . . .” Still childish piping but oddly matured.\n“Welcome, ghola-Bashar,” Sheeana said.\n“You were trying to imprint me!” Angry accusation. “You think my mother didn’t teach me how to prevent that?” A distant expression came over his face. “Ghola?”\n“Some prefer to think of you as a clone.”\n“Who’re ...Sheeana!” He whirled, looking all around the room. It had been selected for its concealed access, no visible hatches. “Where are we?”\n“In the no-ship you took to Dune just before you were killed there.” Still according to the rules.\n“Killed...” Again, he looked at his hands. Watchers could almost see ghola-imposed filters drop from his memories. “l was killed .. . on Dune?” Almost plaintive.\n“Heroic to the end,” Sheeana said.\n“My ...the men I took from Gammu... were they...”\n“Honored Matres made an example of Dune. It’s a lifeless ball, charred to cinders.”\nAnger touched his features. He sat and crossed his legs, placing a clenched fist on each knee. “Yes ...1 learned that in the history of the... of me.” Again, he glanced at Sheeana. She remained seated on the mat, quite still. This was such a plunge into memories as only one who had been through the Agony could appreciate. Utter stillness was required now.\nOdrade whispered: “Don’t interfere, Sheeana. Let it happen. Let him work it out.” She made a hand-signal to the three Proctors. They went to the access hatch, watching her instead of the secret room.\n“I find it odd to consider myself a subject of history,” Teg said. The child’s voice but that recurring sense of maturity in it. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply.\nIn the observation room, Odrade sank back into her chair and asked: “What did you see, Duncan?”\n“When Sheeana pushed him away from her, he turned with a swiftness | have never seen except in Murbella.”\n“Faster even than that.”\n“Perhaps... it's because his body is young and we have given him prana-bindu training.”\n“Something else. You alerted us, Duncan. An unknown in Atreides marker cells.” She glanced at the watchful Proctors and shook her head. No. Not yet. “Damn that mother of his! Hypno-induction to block an Imprinter and she hid it from us.”\n“But look what she gave us,” Idaho said. “A more effective way to restore memories.”\n“We should have seen that on our own!” Odrade felt anger at herself. “Scytale claims Tleilaxu used pain and confrontation. | wonder.”\n“Ask him.”\n“It’s not that simple. Our Truthsayers are not certain of him.”\n“He iS opaque.”\n“When have you studied him?”\n“Dar! | have access to comeye records.”\n“I know, but...”\n“Dammit! Will you keep your eyes on Teg? Look at him! What’s happening?”\nOdrade snapped her attention to the seated child.\nTeg looked at the comeyes, an expression of terrible intensity on his face.\nIt had been for him like awakening from sleep in the stress of conflict, an aide’s hand shaking him. Something needed his attention! He recalled sitting in the no-ship’s command center, Dar standing beside him with a hand on his neck. Scratching him? Something urgent to do. What? His body felt wrong. Gammu... and now they were on Dune and...He remembered different things: childhood on Chapterhouse? Dar as...as...More memories meshed. They tried to imprint me!\nAwareness flowed around this thought like a river spreading itself for a rock.\n“Dar! Are you there? You’re there!”\nOdrade sat back and put a hand to her chin. What now?\n“Mother!” What an accusatory tone!\nOdrade touched a transplate beside her chair. “Hello, Miles. Shall we go for a walk in the orchards?”\n“No more games, Dar. | know why you need me. | warn you, though: Violence projects the wrong kinds of people into power. As if you didn’t know!”\n“Still loyal to the Sisterhood, Miles, in spite of what we just tried?”\nHe glanced at the watchful Sheeana. “Still your obedient dog.”\nOdrade shot an accusatory look at the smiling Idaho. “You and your damned stories!”\n“All right, Miles—no more games but I have to know about Gammu. They say you moved faster than the eye could follow.”\n“True.” Flat, what-the-hell tone.\n“And just now...”\n“This body’s too small to carry the load.”\n“But you...”\n“I used it up in just one burst and I’m starving.”\nOdrade glanced at Idaho. He nodded. Truth.\nShe motioned the Proctors back from the hatch. They hesitated before obeying. What had Bell told them?\nTeg was not through. “Do | have it right, daughter? Since every individual is accountable ultimately to the self, formation of that self demands the utmost care and attention?”\nThat damned mother of his taught him everything!\n“| apologize, Miles. We did not know how your mother prepared you.”\n“Whose idea was it?” He looked at Sheeana as he spoke.\n“My idea, Miles,” Idaho said.\n“Oh, you’re there, too?” More memory trickled back.\n“And | recall the pain you caused me when you restored my memories,” Idaho said.\nThat sobered him. “Point taken, Duncan. No apology needed.” He looked at the speakers relaying their voices. “How’s the air at the top, Dar? Rarefied enough for you?”\nDamned silly idea! she thought. And he knows it. Not rarefied at all. The air was thick with the breathing of those around her, including ones wanting to share her dramatic presence, ones with ideas (sometimes the idea they would be better at her job), ones with offering hands and demanding hands. Rarefied, indeed! She sensed that Teg was trying to tell her something. What?\n“Sometimes | must be the autocrat!”\nShe heard herself saying this to him during one of their orchard walks, explaining “autocrat” to him and adding: “/ have the power and must use it. That drags on me terribly.”\nYou have the power, so use it! That was what this Mentat Bashar was telling her. Ki// me or release me, Dar.\nStill, she stalled for time and knew he would sense it. “Miles, Burzmali’s dead, but he kept a reserve force here he trained himself. The best of—”\n“Don’t bother me with petty details!” What a voice of command! Thin and reedy but all other essentials there.\nWithout being told, the Proctors returned to the hatch. Odrade waved them away with an angry gesture. Only then did she realize that she had reached a decision.\n“Give him back his clothes and bring him out,” she said. “Get Streggi in here.”\nTeg’s first words on emerging alarmed Odrade and made her wonder if she had made a mistake.\n“What if | will not do battle the way you want?”\n“But you said...”\n“I’ve said many things in my... lives. Battle doesn’t reinforce moral sense, Dar.”\nShe (and Taraza) had heard the Bashar on that subject more than once. “Warfare leaves a residue of ‘eat drink and be merry’ that often leads inexorably to moral breakdown.”\nCorrect but she did not know what he had in mind with his reminder. “For every veteran who returns with a new sense of destiny (‘I survived; that must be God’s purpose’) more come home with barely submerged bitterness, ready to take ‘the easy way’ because they saw so much of it in the stresses of war.”\nThey were Teg’s words but her belief.\nStreggi hurried into the room but before she could speak, Odrade motioned her to stand aside and wait silently.\nFor once, the acolyte had the courage to disobey Mother Superior.\n“Duncan should know he has another daughter. Mother and child live and are healthy.” She looked at Teg. “Hello, Miles.” Only then did Streggi remove herself to the rear wall and stand quietly.\nShe is better than | hoped, Odrade thought.\nIdaho relaxed into his chair, feeling now the tensions of worry that had interfered with his appreciation of what he had observed here.\nTeg nodded to Streggi but spoke to Odrade: “Any more words to whisper in God’s ear?” It was essential to control their attention and count on Odrade recognizing it. “If not, I’m really famished.”\nOdrade raised a finger to signal Streggi and heard the acolyte leave.\nShe sensed where Teg was directing her attention and, sure enough, he said: “Perhaps you've really created a scar this time.”\nA barb directed at the Sisterhood’s boast that “We don’t let scars accumulate on our pasts. Scars often conceal more than they reveal.”\n“Some scars revea/ more than they conceal,” he said. He looked at Idaho. “Right, Duncan?” One Mentat to another.\n“I believe I’ve come in on an old argument,” Idaho said.\nTeg looked at Odrade. “See, daughter? A Mentat knows old argument when he hears it. You pride yourselves on knowing what’s required of you at every turn, but the monster at this turning is one of your own making!”\n“Mother Superior!” That was a Proctor who did not want her addressed thus.\nOdrade ignored her. She felt chagrin, harsh and compelling. Taraza Within remembered the dispute: “We are shaped by Bene Gesserit associations. In peculiar ways, they blunt us. Oh, we cut swift and deep when we must, but that’s another kind of blunting.”\n“lII not take part in blunting you,” Teg said. So he remembered.\nStreggi returned with a bowl of stew, brown broth with meat floating in it. Teg sat on the floor and spooned it into his mouth with urgent motions.\nOdrade remained silent, her thoughts moving where Teg had sent them. There was a hard shell Reverend Mothers\nput around themselves against which all things from outside (including emotions) played like projections. Murbella was right and the Sisterhood had to relearn emotions. If they were only observers, they were doomed.\nShe addressed Teg. “You won’t be asked to blunt us.”\nBoth Teg and Idaho heard something else in her voice. Teg put aside his empty bowl but Idaho was first to speak. “Cultivated,” he said.\nTeg agreed. Sisters were seldom impulsive. You got ordered reactions from them even in times of peril. They went beyond what most people thought of as cultivated. They were driven not so much by dreams of power as by their own long view, a thing compounded by immediacy and almost unlimited memory. So Odrade was following a carefully thought out plan. Teg glanced at the watchful Proctors.\n“You were prepared to kill me,” he said.\nNo one answered. There was no need. They all recognized Mentat Projection.\nTeg turned and looked back into the room where he had regained his\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a Bene Gesserit who interacts with the ghola-Bashar and is involved in his memory restoration process>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GHOLA-BASHAR<|>PERSON<|>A clone of the original Bashar, regaining memories and confronting his past>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, overseeing the ghola-Bashar's awakening and making critical decisions>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A Mentat and ghola involved in the memory restoration and strategic discussions>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>The ghola-Bashar, a resurrected military genius with restored memories and unique abilities>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful sisterhood with advanced mental and physical training, involved in political and genetic manipulation>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NO-SHIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A spacecraft used by the Bene Gesserit, capable of evading detection>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>A planet destroyed by the Honored Matres, central to historical conflicts>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet associated with Miles Teg's past and military operations>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>The Bene Gesserit's primary base of operations>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A violent faction that destroyed Dune and opposes the Bene Gesserit>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AGONY<|>EVENT<|>A transformative Bene Gesserit ritual that unlocks ancestral memories>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPRINTER<|>EVENT<|>A Bene Gesserit technique to influence or control others, resisted by Teg>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>GHOLA-BASHAR<|>Sheeana assists in the ghola-Bashar's memory restoration and confronts him about imprinting<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MILES TEG<|>Odrade oversees Teg's awakening and debates his role in the Sisterhood's plans<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MILES TEG<|>Idaho shares insights with Teg about memory restoration and their shared history<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg is a key asset to the Bene Gesserit, but challenges their methods<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOLA-BASHAR<|>DUNE<|>The ghola-Bashar died on Dune and recalls its destruction<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>DUNE<|>The Honored Matres destroyed Dune as an act of dominance<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>GAMMU<|>Teg has significant memories tied to Gammu, including military actions<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>Chapterhouse serves as the Bene Gesserit's stronghold and center of operations<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Odrade and Idaho collaborate on strategic decisions involving Teg<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>AGONY<|>Teg undergoes the Agony, a pivotal event in his memory restoration<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
