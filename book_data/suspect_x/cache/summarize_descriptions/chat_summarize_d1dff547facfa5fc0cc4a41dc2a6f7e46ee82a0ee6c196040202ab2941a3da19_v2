It functions as a critical resource for decision-making and strategy, particularly for individuals such as Bellonda, who works within its confines. The ARCHIVES plays a pivotal role in safeguarding and managing information, ensuring its accessibility for analytical and strategic purposes.  \n\nHowever, its mission has occasionally brought it into conflict with external entities, such as the Bashar, over the handling and control of sensitive or historical information. These clashes highlight the ARCHIVES' commitment to maintaining the integrity and preservation of records, even in the face of opposition.  \n\nIn summary, the ARCHIVES is a multifaceted institution that combines the roles of a knowledge repository, a workplace for key figures like Bellonda, and a guardian of historical data.
