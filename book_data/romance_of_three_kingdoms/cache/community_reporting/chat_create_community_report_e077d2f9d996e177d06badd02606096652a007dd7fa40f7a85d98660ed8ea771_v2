This camp was not only a strategic hub for military planning but also a gathering point for Kongming to assemble and lead his troops effectively.\n\nIn addition to its role in military strategy, 祁山大寨 was vital for logistical support. The camp was equipped with the innovative wooden oxen and flowing horses (木牛流马), which were instrumental in transporting supplies and provisions, ensuring that the Shu forces were well-supplied during their campaigns. This logistical capability underscored the importance of 祁山大寨 as a base of operations for the Shu army, facilitating their movements and enhancing their operational effectiveness in the field.\n\nOverall, 祁山大寨 stands out as a key military installation in the history of the Shu Han, reflecting both the strategic acumen of Kongming and the logistical innovations that supported the Shu forces during their military endeavors.\",2\n2791,高翔,\"高翔 is a prominent military officer associated with the Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period in China.
