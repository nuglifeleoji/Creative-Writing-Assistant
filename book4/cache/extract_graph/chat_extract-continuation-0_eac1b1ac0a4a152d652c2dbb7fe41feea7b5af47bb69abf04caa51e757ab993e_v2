你的机遇。你有了工作；你不再为吃饭和睡觉而熬煎；你还有可以自由支配的金钱。话说回来，就是你和她的爱情，也许还不全是你所想象的一道稍现即逝的彩虹……那么，你，又有什么可伤感的呢？ \n　　自从晓霞离开煤矿后，孙少平就一直纠缠在一团纷乱的思绪中。他对自己和晓霞关系的疑虑是自然的，也不是始于今天。想想他所处的地位和境况，我们完全可以理解他的心情，我们也不必过份担心。少平向来具有说服和开导自己的本领；他不会因此就使自己的精神陷于困顿——直接的结果有时却恰恰相反，他反而奇妙地对生活更加激发起了热情！ \n　　是的，少平每当抬头望见巨塔般雄伟的选煤楼和小山一般的煤堆，或耳听火车和煤溜子隆隆不息的喧吼声，他便会忘记焦虚和痛苦，周身的血液由不得沸扬激荡起来。有时候，在黑暗的井下，他和同伴们在死亡的威胁中完成了一天的任务，然后拖着疲惫的双腿摇摇晃晃走出巷道，升上阳光灿烂的地面，他竟忍不住两眼泪水蒙蒙。是啊，他们有理由为自己的劳动自豪。尽管外面的世界很少有人想到他们的存在，但他们给这世界带来的是力量和光明。生活中真正的勇士向来默默无闻，喧哗不止的永远是自视高贵的一群。只不过，这些满脸黑汗的人，从来不这样想自己，也不这样想别人。劳动对他们来说是一件惯常的事：他们不挖煤叫谁挖呢？而这个世界又离不开这些黑东西……拼命挣扎八九个小时上了地面，有家室的工人马马虎虎洗个澡，连那可爱的太阳都不多瞧几眼，就纷纷走向各个黑户区，钻进了那些低矮的窝棚土窑中——那里有属于他们自己的太阳。他们会安然地坐在小饭桌前，抚摸着孩子，大口大口地喝酒吃菜，那些腰里束着围裙的婆姨们，就象和丈夫久别重逢似地温柔亲热，殷勤地侍候他们吃好、喝好、休息好；然后暖好被窝，周到地给他们性的体贴和关怀。作为一个没有户口、没有工作的煤矿工人的妻子，这就是她们的天职。矿工们正是在妻子温暖的怀抱中，重新恢复了力量和勇气，再一次唤起庄严的生活责任感，几个小时后，又穿上冰凉肮脏的工作衣，从那个“黑口口”里钻入到地层深处……没有家室的光棍们，只好到职工灶上狼吞虎咽吃喝一顿，然后大部分人都回到集体宿舍，倒在自己的床铺上蒙头大睡了。也有一些心神不安的人，出去在矿\n######################\nOutput:",
