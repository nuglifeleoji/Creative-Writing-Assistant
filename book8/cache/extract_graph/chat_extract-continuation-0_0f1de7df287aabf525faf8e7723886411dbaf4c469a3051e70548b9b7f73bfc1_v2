娜娜道：“我的通讯号码刚才你应该有记录了。查一下就可以联系到我。你们什么时候返回天罗星？”\n\n    南澄下意识的道：“明天吧。”\n\n    娜娜点了点头，然后蹲下身体，轻轻的摸了摸蓝轩宇的头，微笑道：“那就明天见喽。”\n\n    直到娜娜的背影完全消失，蓝潇和南澄还有种如在梦中的感觉。\n\n    封号斗罗？如果对方真的是一名封号斗罗的话，那就没什么可值得怀疑得了。封号斗罗别的不说，单是联邦给的供养，就足以让其成为上层人士，有着丰厚的报酬。难怪人家会不计较什么。难道说，真的是和蓝轩宇有缘分？\n\n    蓝潇眉头微蹙，向南澄道：“会不会是发现了什么？”\n\n    南澄摇摇头，道：“咱们不能关心则乱。所有的仪器都查不出什么来，只是外表去看，就算是封号斗罗又能看出什么呢？”\n\n    “爸爸、妈妈，你们在说什么啊？娜娜阿姨是要给我做老师吗？”蓝轩宇睁着大眼睛看着他们。\n\n    南澄道：“那你喜欢娜娜阿姨吗？”\n\n    “喜欢的、喜欢的。”蓝轩宇忙不迭的点头，看看爸爸手中的银龙斗罗手办，他就喜欢的不得了。\n\n    蓝潇道：“看情况再说吧。如果我没记错的话，我们返回的飞船早就没有空位了。她也不知道会如何跟来。我这里确实是有她的通讯号码，可她却没我们的联系方式。如果这样的话都能找来，事实上，我们恐怕连拒绝都做不到。”说到这里，他也不禁苦笑起来。\n\n    被一位封号斗罗看中，想要拒绝也不是什么容易的事情，尤其是在对方是完全善意的情况下。至少从表面上看，娜娜对蓝轩宇是真的喜爱。甚至不惜在人前暴露自己的能力。\n\n    购物的兴趣降低了许多。简单的转了转，聆听着周围顾客们对于先前那场九龙戏珠的惊叹，不久一家三口就回了旅店。\n\n    宇宙飞船可是不等人的，第二天一大早，他们早早的就收拾好行李再次来到天斗星宇航中心，准备乘坐宇宙飞船离开。\n\n    “娜娜阿姨会来吗？”蓝轩宇在候船室内四下张望着，却始终都没看到娜娜的身影。\n\n    “爸爸也不知道。或许，真的要看缘分吧。”蓝潇嘴上这么说着，但实际上心中却并不太希望再看到那绝美的身影。\n\n    南澄却是一副无所谓的心态，如果真的有一位封号斗罗来教导自己的儿子，当然不会是什么坏事。至于吃醋这种事儿，坦白说，自从看到娜娜真容之后，她就根本\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>娜娜<|>PERSON<|>娜娜 is a
