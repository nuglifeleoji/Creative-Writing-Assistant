A scrawny, pinch-faced, and wrinkled older man, he represents a powerful faction within the priesthood that questions Sheeana's divine connection and the Holy Metamorphosis. Skeptical of her significance, Stiros actively opposes Tuek's suggestions to acknowledge her divinity, fearing the consequences of such a decision. He argues for her punishment and seeks to test her claims, reflecting his distrust of the Bene Gesserit's influence.  \n\nDespite his opposition to Sheeana, Stiros is cautious about harming her, recognizing the potential repercussions. His ambitions extend beyond religious doctrine, as he is deeply involved in political conspiracies, including an attack on the temple. This plot ultimately leads to his demise when the Bene Gesserit eliminate him for his role in the scheme. Stiros embodies the tensions within the priesthood—a figure of skepticism, ambition, and defiance, whose actions and beliefs place him at odds with both his peers and the broader power structures of Rakis.\",6\r\n999,HEDLEY TUEK,\"Hedley Tuek is the High Priest and titular ruler of Rakis, serving as both a religious and political leader. As the High Priest of the Divided God, he is deeply involved in the religious and political conflicts of his world, particularly those stemming from the Atreides Manifesto and the influence of the Bene Gesserit. Tuek is an imposing figure, distinguished by his silky gray hair, square face, and striking dark blue pupils. His authority extends to critical decisions regarding Sheeana, a figure of great significance due to her unique abilities, which place her at the center of Rakis's power struggles.  \n\nBalancing his role as a spiritual leader with the complexities of governance, Tuek faces mounting challenges as he navigates the tensions between tradition and the disruptive forces of the Atreides Manifesto and the Bene Gesserit. His leadership is marked by the weight of these conflicts, as he seeks to maintain stability while contending with external pressures and internal divisions. Despite his formidable presence, Tuek's position is precarious, requiring careful diplomacy and decisive action to uphold his authority and the sanctity of his faith.  \n\nIn summary, Hedley Tuek is a pivotal figure on Rakis—a commanding High Priest and ruler whose decisions shape the fate of his people amid religious upheaval and political intrigue. His interactions with Sheeana and his struggles against external influences underscore his central role in the unfolding events of his world.\",6\r\n1002,PRIESTS,\"The priests are young, soft-featured men with uncalloused hands who wear gold and white robes with purple trim.

It serves as a central hub for both the priesthood and the Bene Gesserit, though tensions exist between the two factions, as seen in the argument between High Priest Tuek and Stiros. The city is characterized by its wealth and safety, featuring terraced gardens, windtraps, and a grand temple complex, which starkly contrasts with the harsh desert villages nearby.  \n\nKeen is home to significant landmarks such as the Great Square, where Odrade once observed a dance, and a bustling bazaar. The city also houses the priestly complex and the Bene Gesserit Keep, underscoring its religious and political importance. Despite its grandeur, Keen is not the destination of the sandworms; instead, they are drawn toward the site where the Tyrant died.  \n\nLocated southwest of the desert, Keen is a frequent departure point for Sheeana, who often ventures into the arid wastes and demonstrates her unique ability to summon worms. The city is well-protected by secure barriers like qanats and ring canals, ensuring its safety. It remains a holy and inhabited place on Rakis, where the Bene Gesserit maintain a strong presence despite resistance from the local priesthood. Additionally, Keen is the origin point for arriving VIOs (Visitors, Immigrants, and Observers), further highlighting its significance as a center of activity.  \n\nIn summary, Keen is a thriving, fortified city on Rakis, blending religious authority, Bene Gesserit influence, and cultural vitality, while serving as the backdrop for pivotal events involving Sheeana and other key figures.\",6\r\n1024,DROMIND,\"**Dromind** is a historian-locutor who studied **Sheeana**'s purported divine status and her connection to the ancient **Siona**.

As a result, he faced severe consequences—either being \"\"translated\"\" (a euphemism for execution) or exiled by **Tuek**, depending on the account. Despite the contradictory outcomes described, the core narrative remains consistent: Dromind's dissent against Sheeana's religious authority provoked punitive action from her followers or allied figures like Tuek.
