，却把村里一些人惊得目瞪口呆……从此，刘麻子就成了双水村一个显赫人物。在暗中，人们对他的敬畏已经超过了村中任何一位世俗领袖。新“出马”的神汉刘玉升立即开始为人“治病”。由于几次偶然和巧合，这家伙真的把村里几个人的病“治”了。这下子名声雀起，连外面的地社也不断有人来偷偷请他去治病。 \n　　这大概使得石圪节和米家镇的医院门诊率下降了许多。刘玉升除过躺倒在炕上“闷梦”治病外，还兼着手相，以预测人的祸福和寿数。据刘玉升说，石圪节公社主任徐治功也偷偷让他看过手相，以预测他这辈子的时运和仕途如何。只是治功本人从不承认有过这事。 \n　　刘玉升那纯粹的瞎说有时也会碰巧言中，因此那“神性”竟然越传越玄乎。有些农村的二流子看此道还不错，就想拜他为师学几手——即使不能随意下阴界，光学会看手相就行了。但刘玉升不会将这“秘招”传人。据说，他只给省里慕名而专程来拜访的一位热衷于此道的作家略略指点了一二。 \n　　刘玉升因为和神鬼结了亲缘，又和阎王爷“挂了钩”，无形中对迷信的村民们造成了一种精神压力。人们出于对自己命运的畏惧，谁也不敢再惹这家伙。邻居田海民虽然不信神，但他媳妇银花却怕得要命。经过好言协商，两家人在院当中打起了一堵墙。从此，刘玉升独院里的那两孔破窑洞，就笼罩上一层神秘的色彩，一般人平时谁也不去踏个脚踪……当孙玉厚老汉踏进刘玉升的家门时，这位神汉正坐在后炕头上抽纸烟。他老婆和一群衣衫褴缕的孩子在前炕的一堆破被褥里抢夺着吃什么东西。窑里光线暗淡，给人一种阴森森的感觉。 \n　　孙玉厚简短地向刘玉升说明了来意。 \n　　刘玉升眯着眼沉默了一会，问：“我干妈说啥没有？”“就说梦见一只白狗在肚子上咬了一口……”孙玉厚说。刘玉升又沉默了一会，然后咧开嘴狡狯地笑了笑说：“你家里有玉亭哩……我不能去。但我干妈有病，我也不能不管。你回去，晚上睡觉时，你和我大嫂头蒙住，不要关门，我的魂来呀！” \n　　刘玉升知道孙玉亭的革命性，因此不敢贸然亲自上门去——看来神鬼也有惧怕的东西！ \n　　孙玉厚只好从刘玉升家里出来了。 \n　　晚上睡觉时，玉厚两口子按照刘玉升的指示，没有关门；并且还用被子把头蒙起来。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>刘麻子<|>PERSON<|>刘麻子 is a prominent
