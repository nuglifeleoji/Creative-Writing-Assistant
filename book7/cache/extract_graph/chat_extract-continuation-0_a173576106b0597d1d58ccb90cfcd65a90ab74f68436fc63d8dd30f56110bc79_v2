踏车上写名字的人好像不多了，大概是怕别人摸清底细会有危险。以前，几乎人人都会写上名字，不过时代一变习惯也跟着变了。”\n    “你好像很在意脚踏车。我记得，你之前也说过这种话。”\n    看汤川从刚才到现在的言行举止，草S也开始明白他在意什么了。\n    汤川点点头。\n    “我记得关于现场弃置的脚踏车，之前你曾说那不太可能是故不疑阵，对吧？”\n    “我是说，那种伪装毫无意义。如果要故意将被害者的指纹留在脚踏车上，那就犯不着烧毁尸体的指纹。事实上，我们也根据脚踏车的指纹查出了死者身份。”\n    “问题就在这里了，如果脚踏车上没有指纹怎么办？你们大概就查不出死者身份了吧？”\n    汤川的质疑，令草S沉默了十秒钟，他压根没想过这些问题。\n    “不，”他说：“就结果而言，虽然是因为指纹和那个从出租旅馆失踪的男人的指纹吻合才查明身份，不过就算没有指纹应该也不成问题。我们还做了DNA鉴定，我之前应该也说过了吧？”\n    “我知道。换言之，烧毁尸体指纹一事本身其实毫无意义。可是，如果凶手连这点都已事先计算在内的话怎么办？”\n    “你是说凶手明知多此一举还故意烧掉指纹？”\n    “对凶手来说当然一定有其用意，不过那并不是为了隐瞒死者身份。你有灭有想过，那或许是让你们以为，弃置一旁的脚踏车并非故布疑阵？”\n    这个出人意表的意见，令草S霎时瞠目结舌。\n    “你的意思是，事实上那果然哈市故布疑阵？”\n    “不过，我想不透故布疑阵的目的何在。”汤川从跨坐的脚踏车下来，“凶手想让你们以为死者是自己骑脚踏车去现场，这点应该毫无疑问。问题在于这样故弄玄虚有何意义。”\n    “我的意思是其实死者并非自行前往，而凶手想隐瞒这点。”草S说，“也就是说死者早已遇害，是凶手把尸体搬去那里。我们组长，就主张这个说法。”\n    “而你反对这个说法，是吗？我记得你说过，嫌疑最大的花冈靖子没有驾照。”\n    “如果有共犯那就另当别论了。”草S回答。\n    “好吧，这个姑且不提。我现在更在乎的问题，是脚踏车失窃的时间。你们似乎已确定实在上午十一点至晚间十点之间，但我听了倒是很奇怪。亏你们能把时间锁定得这么清楚。”\n    “你跟我说有什么用，是车主自己这样说的。这应该不是什么复杂问题吧。”\n    “你说到重点了。”汤川拿着咖啡罐朝草S一指，“怎么会这么轻易就找到车主？”\n
