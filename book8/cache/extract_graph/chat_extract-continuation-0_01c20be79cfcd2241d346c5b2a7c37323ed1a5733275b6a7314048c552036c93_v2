每天实在是太忙碌了，总是有种晕头转向的感觉。最初，高能少年班的学员可以一周回家一次，可很快就改成了一个月才可以回家一次。距离第一学期期末考试，只剩下最后一个月了。\n\n    “轩宇，你今晚还要去副院长那里吗？”钱磊问道。\n\n    蓝轩宇点了点头，苦笑道：“肯定要去的啊！”别的不说，单是为了每天老师给他提供的那么多珍稀食材，他就舍不得不去。更何况，他也相信，老师的教导一定是有用的。\n\n    “还有一个月就要期末考试了，咱们是不是也该合练合练了？”钱磊问蓝轩宇愣了一下，点点头：“是啊，是该练练了。那我今天去跟老师说，看看后面能不能给我们留点时间。”\n\n    “好。话说，我魂力十七级了，哈哈！”他们这些被精挑细选出来的学员，魂力等级确实比同龄人要高得多。\n\n    蓝轩宇一脸无奈地道：“我才十五级。你下学期能到二十级吗？”钱磊耸了耸肩膀，道：“够呛吧，还差三级呢。疯子估计下学期末有戏，他比我早达到十七级。不过，我估计下学期我的精神力能破两百。\n\n    我跟你说，咱们天罗星能达到这水平的估计都没几个。厉不厉害?对了，你的精神力最近提升得怎么样？年底考核，咱俩估计还是“十加’吧？”蓝轩宇道：“我也不知道，天天头昏脑涨的。好了，我要赶紧走了。”\n\n    说完，他急匆匆地出了宿舍，直奔银天凡的办公室而去。\n\n    等他来到银天凡的办公室时，意外见到了季洪彬。\n\n    “胖子，你是不是疯了?你怎么能这么教孩子?要是出了意外，你负得起责任吗？”季洪彬正气急败坏地向银天凡叫器着。\n\n    银天凡道：“这不是没出意外吗？你能不能不要这么谨小慎微，你以前可不是这样的。”\n\n    季洪彬怒道：“这叫谨小慎微吗？你那模拟舱是什么级别？是他这修为的人能进的吗？他要是有个好歹，我们怎么跟他父母交代？”银天凡有些不耐烦了：“你烦不烦，如果没有基本判断，我能让他进我的模拟舱吗？他能够在只有一环修为的情况下吼退黄金狮王，这意味着什么？意味着他自身的血脉还在黄金狮王\n\n    之上。\n\n    我仔细观看过录像，他那蓝银草上的纹路分明是龙纹。也就是说，他这蓝银草的变异是和龙有关的，而且绝不是普通的真龙。\n\n    否则的话，怎么可能在混合了蓝银草之后还能震慑黄金狮王？但他的血脉力量显然还没有被完全激发出来，不然他应该能经常发出那龙吟声。\n\n    外界的压力，会催动他的血脉进一步觉醒。“再说了，从星际战机开始体验，会�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a student in the 高能少年班, known for his
