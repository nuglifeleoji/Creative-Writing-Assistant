�同意向全国播放经过翻译的外部新闻。\n　　“播放系统已经打开。”\n　　FG的话音刚落，巨型屏幕上出现了相应的提示。现在是下午五点三十分，不知全国的孩子有多少这时还在睡觉，但醒着的孩子现在都可以从电视上看到华华和小梦。两个孩子立刻紧张起来，在两个月前发布灾情报告时，他们曾向全国孩子广播过，但那是照着现成的文稿念，现在，当他们再次面对这片广阔国土上的所有孩子时，只觉得无数目光从四面八方射来，一时不知该说什么好。\n　　“小朋友们，”小梦说，“我们想告诉大家，世界别处的孩子都在工作，真的！我们这儿能收到全世界的广播和电视，我们看到他们在田地里播下种子，让工厂的机器重新开起来……你们听到了吗？听到了就请你们朝这里挂电话！”\n　　过了三分钟，FG说：“没有回答。”\n　　“一点都没有吗？”华华问。\n　　“只收到十三万个电话。”\n　　数目惊人，但同三亿这个数目相比，确实等于没有回答。这倒使两个孩子松弛下来，他们现在知道看着他们的孩子远没有想像的那么多。\n　　“你把收到的那些广播和电视向小朋友放一些好吗？”\n　　FG答应了，它选了二十分钟的广播录音和电视录像向全国播放，巨型电脑是在出色地配合两个孩子，它选择和剪辑的新闻录音和录像都很有代表性，较真实完整地反映了目前的世界状况。但这次收到的回话也只有不到二十万个。\n　　“他们懒得理我们。”小梦说。\n　　“也许他们都在睡觉，想法叫醒他们。”华华说。\n　　FG开始播放一部在二十世纪未风靡世界的科幻影片，选择的是声音最大的那一段：银河帝国的星际舰队在追逐银河共和国的星际战斗机群，激光炮的轰鸣声和宇宙飞行器的尖啸声响彻整个太空。这段影片放了有五分钟，然后重新播放刚才的国际新闻剪辑，这次收到了二百万个电话。FG把这些回答做了归纳：\n　　“讨厌，人家睡觉呢！”\n　　“那些孩子愿干什么就干什么，关我们什么事儿？现在我们过得比他们舒服多了，谁有我们这么舒服？”\n　　“信息大厦中那些孩子也真是，三亿小朋友都不着急他们着什么急？犯贱！”\n　　随后外界又很快沉睡过去，对什么信息都不再有反应。\n　　华华和小梦叹了口气，放弃了自己的努力。\n　　这是超新星纪元第45天，糖城时代的长长的沉睡时期进入睡得最深的阶段，同时也快结束了。\n　　这天夜里，华华和小梦透过大厦的高大的玻璃窗看着外面的城市。和以前两个月一样，城市里灯光稀少，玫瑰星云把城市罩在一片神秘的蓝光之中，那一群高层建筑在这蓝光中像沉睡的冰山。\n　　“你还记得超新星爆发那天�\n######################\nOutput:",
