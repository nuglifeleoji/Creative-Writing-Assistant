The title denotes supreme battlefield command and is associated with significant authority, potentially leading to higher noble ranks such as Baronies or Earldoms. Teg, both in his original form and as a ghola, is central to Bene Gesserit plans, particularly in relation to **Duncan Idaho's** training and the broader strategic interests of the order.  \n\nThe Bashar is remembered as a legendary figure in Bene Gesserit history, renowned for his reliability, tactical brilliance, and insightful teachings. His original incarnation was a father figure to **Odrade** and died on **Dune**, but his legacy endured through his cells, which were used to create the ghola Teg. This ghola later fled from **Gammu** into the **Scattering** after a violent episode, further cementing the Bashar's controversial yet respected reputation.  \n\nThe title is also referenced in historical and political contexts, with **Odrade** invoking the Bashar as a reminder to reinterpret the past, while the **Tleilaxu** express concerns about his influence. Additionally, the Bashar is tied to familial and ancestral respect, with mentions of family holdings on **Lernaeus**.  \n\nThough some descriptions suggest the Bashar made controversial statements about the destruction of historical records, the overarching narrative emphasizes his role as a strategic leader and a symbol of military excellence. Whether as Teg’s rank, a historical figure, or a ghola, the Bashar remains a pivotal and revered presence in Bene Gesserit lore.\",12\n1551,TEG,\"**Bashar Miles Teg** is a revered military leader, Mentat, and key figure in the Bene Gesserit’s strategic operations. Trained by the Sisterhood and possessing enhanced abilities—possibly due to a T-probe or other external stimuli—he is renowned for his tactical brilliance, combat skills, and heightened perception. Teg serves as a mentor to Duncan Idaho, training him and aiding in the restoration of his original memories, though he finds the process distasteful. His loyalty to the Bene Gesserit is unwavering, and he carries out critical missions, including protecting Duncan’s ghola and leading operations against threats like the Honored Matres and Tleilaxu.  \n\nTeg’s history is marked by gallant stands, such as his last battle on Gammu, where he was hunted and later captured by the Honored Matres. Despite enduring torture and interrogation, he resists using his Mentat and Bene Gesserit training. His strategic assessments, including critiques of Junction’s defenses, are highly valued. Teg is also linked to the Atreides lineage, sharing a resemblance to Duke Leto and demonstrating moral superiority.  \n\nCurrently, his status varies across accounts: some describe him as missing, others as actively leading missions or being restored as Supreme Bashar. A ghola of Teg exists, undergoing memory recovery under Duncan’s guidance, suggesting the Bashar’s legacy continues. Teg is regarded as a father figure by both Duncan and Odrade, further cementing his importance to the Bene Gesserit’s plans. His multifaceted role—strategist, protector, and symbol of resilience—makes him indispensable to the Sisterhood’s survival.\",102\n1718,YSAI,\"**YSAI** is a major metropolis located on the planet **Gammu** (formerly known as **Giedi Prime**), historically significant as the ancient **Harkonnen seat of Barony**. The city is a hub of activity, characterized by its chaotic and disorganized urban structure, featuring mismatched and ancient buildings that reflect its long and turbulent history. Among its most notable landmarks is a **prominent black rectangle of a building**, which **Teg** associates with the \"\"puppet masters,\"\" suggesting a center of power or control.  \n\nYSAI serves as a critical destination for multiple key figures. **Teg** seeks refuge here, aided by allies despite the city's inherent dangers, and it is where he is located after his attack on the **Honored Matres**. The city also acts as a **Bene Gesserit operational hub**, featuring advanced security systems and safe addresses for their activities. Additionally, **Lucilla** and **Burzmali** travel to YSAI under disguise, entering through its **lower-class quarter**, which boasts an active nightlife.  \n\nThe city's outskirts are marked by **overgrown tracks**, and its chaotic layout extends beyond its urban core. **Duncan Idaho** and **Tormsa** traveled through YSAI before their capture, further emphasizing its role as a crossroads for pivotal events. Functionaries with **datacases** are frequently observed here, reinforcing its status as a center of administrative or clandestine operations.  \n\nDespite some discrepancies in naming (occasionally referred to as **Y'sai** or **Ysai**), the descriptions consistently portray YSAI as a **dangerous yet strategically vital city**—a place of refuge, intrigue, and historical weight, deeply tied to the legacies of the **Harkonnens** and the ongoing struggles of the **Bene Gesserit** and their allies.\",3\n1567,FIRUS,\"**FIRUS** is Dimela's husband and plays a key role in managing Teg's estate. Alongside Patrin, he is also privy to Teg's specific intentions and preferences concerning the South Farm, indicating his involvement in both estate management and decision-making related to Teg's agricultural holdings. This dual role highlights FIRUS's trusted position within Teg's affairs, serving as both a familial support to Dimela and a knowledgeable figure in executing Teg's directives.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively portray FIRUS as a reliable and informed individual, entrusted with responsibilities that span both personal and estate-related matters. There are no contradictions in the provided information; rather, the details complement each other to present a cohesive picture of his roles and relationships.\",2\n1803,RENDITAI,\"**Renditai** was a minor skirmish in Teg's military history, where he commanded loyal soldiers and fought alongside others who later became his allies. This past battle or event played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of Teg's followers, as many of those who fought with him eventually settled in Ysai. While the conflict itself was relatively small in scale, its aftermath fostered lasting bonds among the participants, reinforcing Teg's leadership and the loyalty of his companions. The event is remembered as a pivotal moment that contributed to the cohesion of Teg's forces and their subsequent presence in Ysai.  \n\nIn summary, Renditai was a brief but consequential engagement in Teg's career, uniting soldiers who would later support him and establish themselves in Ysai. The skirmish underscores the interconnectedness of Teg's military endeavors and the enduring relationships forged through shared combat.\",2\n1807,IXIAN MANUFACTURE,\"Ixian manufacture refers to the high-quality pre-Scattering technology, including the groundcar Teg is riding in.\",2\n1862,DANIAN MARINETE,\"**Danian Marinete** is a distinguished brandy known for its deep blue hue and its association with notable figures. It is mentioned as the preferred drink of the original Bashar, highlighting its esteemed status among connoisseurs. Additionally, the brandy is also favored by Teg, further cementing its reputation as a choice beverage for discerning individuals. The producers of Danian Marinete are recognized for crafting this unique and high-quality spirit, which stands out for its rich color and refined taste. Overall, Danian Marinete is celebrated as a premium brandy with a legacy of appeal among influential personalities.\",2\n1569,LERNAEUS,\"**LERNAEUS** is a planet that serves as the homeworld of **Firus** and the **Roxbroughs**, as well as the location of **Teg's** expansive research garden. As the primary residence of these individuals, Lernaeus holds significance both as a dwelling place and a site of scientific exploration. The planet's environment supports diverse flora, as evidenced by Teg's dedicated garden, which is used for extensive research purposes. While the descriptions do not provide further details about Lernaeus's climate, geography, or societal structure, it is clear that the planet plays a central role in the lives of its inhabitants, functioning as both a home and a hub for botanical study.  \n\nThe coexistence of residential and research facilities suggests that Lernaeus may have a balanced ecosystem capable of sustaining both natural life and controlled cultivation. Whether Teg's garden is a private endeavor or part of a larger scientific institution remains unspecified, but its presence underscores the planet's importance as a place of learning and discovery alongside its role as a homeworld.  \n\nIn summary, Lernaeus is a multifaceted planet, serving as the native world for Firus and the Roxbroughs while also hosting Teg's research garden, indicating its dual significance as a living space and a center for botanical study.\",1\n1572,LETO ATREIDES I,\"The first Leto Atreides, grandfather of the Tyrant, whom Miles Teg resembles\",1\n1568,SOUTH FARM,\"**SOUTH FARM**  \n\n**SOUTH FARM** is a location within Teg's estate, primarily associated with agricultural activities and management. It is currently under the oversight of Firus, who is responsible for managing replanting efforts on the property. The farm is also referenced in relation to orders issued by Teg, suggesting it plays a significant role in the estate's operations, whether for cultivation, resource management, or other logistical purposes.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provide slightly different contexts—one emphasizing its replanting management and the other its connection to Teg's directives—they collectively depict **SOUTH FARM** as an active and strategically important part of Teg's estate. There are no direct contradictions between the two descriptions; rather, they complement each other by highlighting different aspects of the farm's function and governance.  \n\nIn summary, **SOUTH FARM** serves as a key agricultural site within Teg's estate, managed by Firus for replanting and subject to orders from Teg, indicating its operational and possibly economic significance.\",1\n1679,BASHAR'S QUARTERS,\"Teg's private living and working space within the Keep\"\"\",1\n1702,THE GUILDSHIP,The ship where Taraza and Teg interacted before their current situation,1\n1705,THE FAMINE TIMES,Historical period referenced in Teg's thoughts about Gammu's wilderness,1\n1708,FIVE ATTITUDES,The Five Attitudes are Bene Gesserit combat techniques taught to Teg by his mother,1\n1741,MARKON,The Battle of Markon is a historical event where Teg's reputation caused the enemy to sue for terms.,1\n1742,ARBELOUGH,The Battle of Arbelough is a historical event where Teg shared risks with his troops and spared the enemy.,1\n1743,KROININ,The assault on Kroinin is a historical event where Teg broke the anti-Sisterhood forces.,1\n1788,BATTLE OF PONCIARD,A conflict recalled by Teg involving his woolen clothing and command pod odors>,1\n1624,WINTER SHOW,\"The **WINTER SHOW** is an event referenced by Miles Teg in two distinct contexts. In one instance, Teg recalls it as a childhood performance featuring puppets named **Dit, Dat, and Dot**, suggesting a playful and nostalgic memory. In another, he compares the illusions of Face Dancers to a magician's act from the same show, implying it also included sleight-of-hand or deceptive performances.  \n\nThese descriptions may seem contradictory at first—one emphasizing puppetry and the other magic—but they can be reconciled as a multifaceted event. The **WINTER SHOW** likely combined different acts, such as puppet shows and magic performances, catering to varied entertainment tastes. Teg's references highlight different aspects of the show: the puppets as a personal childhood memory and the magician as a point of comparison for advanced deception.  \n\nIn summary, the **WINTER SHOW** was a versatile event featuring both puppetry (with characters like Dit, Dat, and Dot) and magic acts, leaving a lasting impression on Teg, who drew upon its elements in later reflections. The dual descriptions enrich its portrayal as a memorable spectacle blending whimsy and illusion.\",1\n1806,PLANETARY BANK OF GAMMU,The Planetary Bank of Gammu owns the groundcar Teg is using for transport. It was one of his contact points during his inspection tour.,1\n1810,SOLITZ,\"**SOLITZ** is a trained **Suk doctor** who specializes in medical examinations and treatments. Recognizable by the **orange brand or tattoo** on his forehead—a distinctive mark of his Suk training—he is skilled in assessing and addressing health concerns. In one instance, he examines **Teg**, likely evaluating the aftereffects of a stunner, and prescribes a meal tailored to Teg's specific needs. His expertise and attention to individual requirements highlight his proficiency as a medical professional within the Suk tradition. The descriptions align in portraying him as a competent and attentive healer, with minor variations in terminology (brand vs. tattoo) that do not contradict his identity or role.  \n\n(Word count: 100)\",1\n1851,SCANLYZER CONTROLS,,1\n1855,YSAL,\"Ysai is the city where Teg is currently located, seeking help and refuge\"\"\",1\n1856,ACLINE,\"Acline is another past battle where Teg served, known for saving many lives\"\"\",1\n2045,MARINETE,\"Marinete is referenced by Teg as a drink he desires, possibly an event or significant substance.\"\"\",1\n2071,HAKER,\"**HAKER** serves as **Teg's personal aide**, assisting in various capacities during combat and tactical operations. Primarily, Haker is responsible for providing updates to Teg and executing orders during battles. Additionally, Haker plays a key role in managing **Honored Matre prisoners**, ensuring compliance with Teg's directives. This dual responsibility highlights Haker's importance in both active combat support and post-conflict operations, acting as a trusted subordinate in Teg's command structure.  \n\nThe descriptions align in depicting Haker as a loyal and efficient aide, consistently carrying out Teg's orders in high-stakes situations. There are no contradictions; rather, the details complement each other to form a cohesive role encompassing battlefield coordination and prisoner oversight.\",1\n2072,COMMAND POD,\"Teg's Command Pod is a critical piece of military equipment that was destroyed in the battle\"\"\",1\n2077,SPACE BATTLE,\"Prior conflict where Teg's forces defeated Honored Matre ships\"\"\",1\n2088,HONORED MATRE AERIE,\"The Honored Matre stronghold where Teg was held\"\"\",1\n1785,YAR,\"**YAR** is a male functionary responsible for the interrogation and monitoring of Teg using a T-probe console. Described as having a sullen voice, he operates the advanced interrogation device, adjusting pain levels and closely observing Teg's reactions during the process. YAR is known to suggest extreme measures in the course of his duties, indicating a ruthless or uncompromising approach to his role. His primary function revolves around the use of the T-probe, a tool designed to extract information or manipulate subjects through controlled pain and sensory feedback. Collectively, the descriptions portray YAR as a cold, methodical interrogator, focused on his task with little regard for the subject's well-being.  \n\nThe summaries align in depicting YAR as a key operator of the T-probe, emphasizing his direct involvement in Teg's interrogation. While one description highlights his vocal demeanor (\"\"sullen voice\"\"), another underscores his technical role in adjusting pain levels, reinforcing his hands-on control over the process. The mention of \"\"extreme measures\"\" suggests a willingness to escalate interrogation tactics, further solidifying his reputation as a severe and unyielding figure.  \n\nIn summary, YAR is a male interrogator who employs the T-probe as his primary tool, meticulously monitoring and manipulating Teg's responses. His demeanor is characterized by a sullen tone, and his methods are marked by a readiness to employ harsh measures, painting him as a formidable and relentless functionary in his field.\",5\n1721,NO-GLOBE,\"The **NO-GLOBE** is a hidden and shielded Harkonnen facility designed for concealment, serving multiple strategic and narrative purposes. It is the site where **Duncan Idaho** undergoes reawakening, marking a pivotal moment in his journey. The NO-GLOBE also functions as a refuge for **Duncan**, **Miles Teg**, and **Lucilla**, who reside there in isolation, cut off from the outside world and its temporal flow. The facility is filled with preserved artifacts, suggesting it may have been repurposed or maintained over time for clandestine operations.  \n\nLocated in a remote area, the NO-GLOBE is near where **Burzmali** establishes his command post, indicating its tactical importance. The facility's shielded nature makes it an ideal hiding spot, allowing its occupants to evade detection. At one point, **Teg**, **Duncan**, and **Lucilla** emerge from the NO-GLOBE into a cold night, further emphasizing its secluded and controlled environment.  \n\nIn summary, the NO-GLOBE is a multifunctional Harkonnen stronghold—serving as a reawakening site, a temporal refuge, and a strategic hideout—while remaining concealed from external forces. Its isolation and preservation of artifacts suggest long-term significance in the broader conflict.\",7\n1576,JANET ROXBROUGH,\"**JANET ROXBROUGH**  \n\nJanet Roxbrough was the mother of Teg, a prominent figure associated with the Bene Gesserit order. She held the rank of Reverend Mother and belonged to the Lernaeus Roxbroughs, a lineage or group within the Bene Gesserit. Descriptions of her relationship to Teg vary slightly, with one source identifying her as his birth mother and another simply as his mother, but both confirm her Bene Gesserit affiliation and her status as a Reverend Mother. The reference to \"\"Lernaeus\"\" suggests a possible connection to a specific branch or house within the order, though further details about her role or influence remain unspecified.  \n\nIn summary, Janet Roxbrough was a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother from the Lernaeus Roxbroughs and the mother (or birth mother) of Teg, underscoring her significance within the order and her familial ties to a key individual.\",2\n1565,LEARNAEUS,\"**LEARNAEUS** is a planet known for its association with the Bashar's family holdings and as the home of the prominent figure Miles Teg. It features a stately house situated near a river, serving as both Teg's childhood residence and his later retirement sanctuary. During his youth, Lernaeus was where Teg's mother revealed his Atreides lineage to him while he was on leave from school. In his later years, the planet became a peaceful retreat for Teg, where he was visited by the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Taraza.  \n\nLernaeus thus holds significant personal and historical importance, functioning as a familial stronghold, a site of pivotal personal revelations, and a secluded haven for Teg at different stages of his life. The planet's serene environment, marked by its stately house and river, underscores its dual role as both a place of heritage and solitude.\",2\n1617,LERNEAUS,\"**Lernaeus** is the home planet of **Janet Roxbrough**, the birth-mother of **Miles Teg**, and serves as the setting for key moments in his early life. It was the location of the **Teg family's dining room**, where Miles fondly recalls childhood memories of shared meals with his family. Additionally, Lernaeus was the site of his childhood home, where he encountered **Bene Gesserit acolytes**, including **Carlana**, hinting at early influences that may have shaped his later connections to the order. The planet thus holds personal and formative significance in Teg's life, serving as both a familial anchor and a backdrop for his early interactions with the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively paint Lernaeus as a place of warmth, family ties, and subtle political or religious undertones due to the presence of Bene Gesserit members. There are no direct contradictions in the provided details, only complementary layers that enrich the planet's role in Teg's history. The summary integrates all aspects into a coherent narrative, emphasizing Lernaeus as a foundational setting in Miles Teg's upbringing.\",2\n1769,PIINGITAM,,1\n1787,T-PROBE,\"The **T-PROBE** is a sophisticated and torturous device originating from the Scattering, designed to replicate and manipulate a subject's sensory inputs and bodily functions. It has been notably used on the individual **Teg**, both as a tool for interrogation and as a means of inflicting severe physical and psychological torment. During a previous encounter, the T-probe was employed to extract critical information from Teg, demonstrating its effectiveness as an instrument of coercion.  \n\nBeyond its use as an interrogation device, the T-probe also had a transformative effect on Teg, altering his perception and enhancing his innate abilities—particularly his time sense. However, this enhancement came at a great cost, as the device's manipulations severely affected his physical condition and temporal awareness, leaving lasting repercussions.  \n\nWhile the T-probe's primary function appears to be torture and information extraction, its dual nature—as both a destructive and transformative tool—highlights its advanced and insidious design. The device's capacity to simultaneously inflict pain and induce physiological changes makes it a uniquely dangerous instrument within the technological arsenal of the Scattering.\",2\n1786,FUNCTIONARY,\"The **FUNCTIONARY** is an unnamed official involved in the interrogation of Teg. Tasked with overseeing the process, the Functionary is described as demanding maximum pain to break Teg's resistance, indicating a ruthless and authoritarian approach. Armed with a lasgun, the Functionary actively participates in the interrogation but is ultimately defeated by Teg, suggesting either Teg's superior resilience or combat prowess. Despite the Functionary's aggressive tactics, their efforts prove unsuccessful, highlighting their role as an antagonist who fails to achieve their objective. The descriptions collectively portray the Functionary as a hostile, weapon-carrying official whose authority is undermined by Teg's defiance.\",2\n1808,MUZZAFAR,\"**MUZZAFAR** is a complex and multifaceted figure associated with both the forces of Dur and the Honored Matres during the events of the Scattering. He holds the rank of Field Marshal within Dur’s military hierarchy and serves as a regional commander, demonstrating his significant authority. Muzzafar encounters the Bashar Miles Teg in Ysai, where he acts as both a host and an escort, facilitating Teg’s meeting with an Honored Matre. During their interactions, Muzzafar reveals a personal connection to his homeland by showing Teg a holostat of a frame bush, suggesting a lingering attachment to his origins despite his current allegiances.  \n\nHowever, Muzzafar’s relationship with the Honored Matre complicates his role. While he appears to be a loyal servant—possibly under her psychological or chemical control—he also exhibits a degree of awareness, warning Teg about the Honored Matre’s formidable power and expectations. This duality implies that Muzzafar may be a reluctant subordinate, caught between his military duties and the Honored Matre’s dominance. His submissive behavior toward her contrasts with his otherwise authoritative position, hinting at coercion or manipulation.  \n\nDescriptions of Muzzafar’s personality vary. Some portray him as sharing the Honored Matre’s cruel tendencies and joyless demeanor, aligning him with her ruthless methods. Yet another account claims he was killed by Teg during a counterattack, though this may refer to a different individual or a later event not fully detailed in the provided descriptions. Resolving these contradictions, the most coherent interpretation is that Muzzafar is a high-ranking Dur officer who becomes entangled with the Honored Matres, serving them out of loyalty, fear, or compulsion. His fate remains ambiguous, but his role as an intermediary between Teg and the Honored Matre underscores his strategic importance in their conflict.  \n\nIn summary, **MUZZAFAR** is a Field Marshal of Dur, a military leader with personal depth, who navigates a precarious position between duty and subjugation to the Honored Matres. His actions reveal a blend of authority, vulnerability, and complicity in the power struggles of the Scattering.\",4\n1809,DUR,\"Dur is a force from the Scattering, commanded by Muzzafar, with unknown motives and affiliations\"\"\",2\n1811,FRAME BUSH,\"A frame bush is a plant that can be directed to grow into a residence.
