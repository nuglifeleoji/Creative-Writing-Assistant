Built in a notch of the Shield Wall, it is a bustling hub of political, religious, and ceremonial activity, often visited by Leto’s royal entourage. The city is associated with significant events, including the Decennial Festival, where public rituals like Siaynoq take place in its plaza—a site marked by religious fervor and occasional violence.  \n\nBeneath Onn lies a secret, windowless room where a woman works in secrecy, and deep underground regions house structures such as ramps and service burrows used for rebel meetings. The city is a center of rebellion, known for its mechanical smells and as a base for dissident activities. It is also near the Forbidden Forest and features orchards and gardens that sustain its population.  \n\nOnn’s landscape is cluttered with houses, forests, and remnants of the ancient city of Arrakeen, reflecting Leto’s controlled environment. It is home to the Fish Speakers' School, where Siona studies, and is a destination for off-world visitors. The city is linked to pivotal moments, such as Duncan Idaho’s arrival after his resurrection, Hwi Noree’s summons by Leto, and the Tleilaxu’s planned attack on the God Emperor.  \n\nDespite its ceremonial importance, Onn is also a place of tension—mentioned in the context of Idaho’s \"\"night of alarms\"\" and as a potential trigger for Leto’s transformation into the Worm. While Siona once considered returning to Onn, the royal entourage often diverts to the Citadel instead. The city’s peculiar design, centered around its plaza for public viewing, underscores its role as a stage for Leto’s rule and the empire’s unfolding drama.  \n\nPronounced with a nasal inflection, Onn remains a key location in the empire’s geography, blending grandeur, secrecy, and rebellion beneath its festival-driven facade.\",14\n1186,HOLY METAMORPHOSIS,\"The **Holy Metamorphosis** is a pivotal event or concept tied to **Leto II**, the God Emperor in the *Dune* universe. It encompasses two interconnected aspects: his removal from the evolutionary succession and his transformation into the **Divided God**, which also led to the creation of **sandtrout**.  \n\nInitially, the Holy Metamorphosis marks Leto II's departure from the established path of human evolution, signifying a deliberate break from his role as a guiding force. This shift is not merely physical but also symbolic, representing a fundamental change in his relationship with humanity and the broader cosmic order.  \n\nSimultaneously, the Holy Metamorphosis describes Leto II's physical transformation into the **Divided God**, a state where his consciousness fragments while his body merges with sandtrout—small, worm-like creatures integral to the desert ecosystem of Arrakis. This process ensures his legacy persists in a dispersed form, influencing future events beyond his direct rule.  \n\nWhile the descriptions differ slightly—one emphasizing his removal from evolution and the other focusing on his physical transformation—they are not contradictory. Instead, they reflect different dimensions of the same event: the Holy Metamorphosis represents both an ideological and biological shift, marking the end of Leto II's centralized rule and the beginning of a new phase in the universe's unfolding destiny.  \n\nIn summary, the **Holy Metamorphosis** is the moment when **Leto II** transcends his singular existence, withdrawing from evolutionary guidance while undergoing a profound physical change that disperses his essence into sandtrout, ensuring his enduring influence on the cosmos.\",2\n1395,DURO NUNEPI,\"Duro Nunepi is the Tleilaxu Ambassador, a proud and flinty-faced man who represents the Tleilaxu in negotiations with Leto II.

This era of stability was upheld through a combination of Leto's authoritarian governance, the disciplined enforcement of the Fish Speakers (his elite military force), and other stringent measures designed to suppress rebellion and ensure order across the Empire.  \n\nThe peace was not voluntary but imposed, ensuring that no major conflicts or wars disrupted the Empire for millennia. While descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the coercive nature of this tranquility, attributing its longevity to Leto's unyielding control and the mechanisms he instituted to preserve his reign. The Fish Speakers, as both protectors and enforcers, played a pivotal role in sustaining this peace, acting as both a military and religious order loyal to Leto.  \n\nDespite minor variations in wording, the core concept remains clear: LETO'S PEACE was a rigid, artificial stability, lasting three thousand years, directly tied to Leto II's dominion and the systems he implemented to enforce it. There are no contradictions in the descriptions, only reinforcing the idea of an unchanging, controlled era under his rule.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1938,LETO II,GHANIMA,\"**LETO II and GHANIMA** are the twin children of Paul Atreides and Chani, born with the extraordinary ability to access ancestral memories—a trait inherited from their Bene Gesserit lineage.
