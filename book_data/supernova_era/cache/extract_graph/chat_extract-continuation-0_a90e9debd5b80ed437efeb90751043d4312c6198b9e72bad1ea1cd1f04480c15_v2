“哪里不同？那我问你，你现在有正常工作吗？”\n    “我会去工作的，我已经找到工作了。”\n    “这表示你现在没有工作喽？”\n    “我不是跟你说我找到工作了吗？下个月开始上班。虽然是新公司，等上了轨道，就可以让你们母女过好日子了。”\n    “免了。既然收入那么好，你另找对象应该也没问题吧。算我求你，请你别再纠缠我们了。”\n    “靖子，我真的需要你。”\n    富坚再次伸出手，想握住她拿杯子的手。“别碰我！”她说着甩开那只手。结果杯中的液体顺势洒出一些，溅到富坚手上。“好烫”他喊着缩回手，凝视她的双眼随即露出憎恶之情。\n    “你不用说得这么好听。你以为我会相信这种话吗？之前我也说过了，我一点也不想跟你复合。你就趁早死了这条心吧，听懂了吗？”\n    靖子站起来，富坚无言地盯着她。她对那道视线置之不理，把可可的费用往桌上一摆，径自走向出口。\n    出了餐厅后，她跨上停在旁边的脚踏车，立刻踩的飞快。她怕万一再耗下去让富坚追上来就麻烦了。她沿着清洲桥路直走，过了清洲桥就左转。\n    她自认该说的都已说了，但显然丝毫无法让富坚死心，想必他很快又会在店里出现。他会缠着靖子，直到最后惹出问题给店里带来困扰，也或许会在美里的国中出现。那个男人在等靖子投降，他早已算准靖子迟早会投降给钱。\n    回到公寓，她开始准备晚餐，不过其实也只是把从店里带回来的剩菜热一热。即便如此靖子还是做得有一搭没一搭。因为可怕的想象不断膨胀，令她不由得失魂落魄。\n    美里也差不多该到家了。加入羽毛球社的她，练习结束后，总会和其他社员七嘴八舌的聊上一阵子才踏上归途。所以回到家时，通常都已经过了七点。\n    门铃突然响起。靖子惊讶的走向玄关，美里应该带了钥匙。\n    “来了。”靖子从门内问：“哪位？”\n    隔了一会儿才响起对方的回答：“是我。”\n    靖子感到眼前发黑。不祥的预感果然成真，富坚连这间公寓都找到了。想必他之前曾经从“天亭”一路跟踪过她。\n    看靖子不回答，富坚开始敲门。“喂！”\n    她摇着头打开锁。不过门链依然挂着。\n    一把门打开十公分的缝隙，对面立刻露出富坚那张脸。他嘻嘻一笑，牙齿很黄。\n
