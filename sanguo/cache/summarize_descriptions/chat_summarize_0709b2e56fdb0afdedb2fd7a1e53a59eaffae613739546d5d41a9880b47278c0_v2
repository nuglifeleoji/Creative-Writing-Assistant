This conspiracy is notably linked to Ji Ping's actions, which have raised suspicions and concerns within Cao Cao's circle. During this interrogation, Cao Cao seeks to ascertain the extent of Wang Zifu's knowledge about the conspiracy and his potential involvement in it.\n\nWang Zifu finds himself in a precarious position, as he is implicated in the conspiracy against Cao Cao. This implication suggests a relationship of opposition between the two figures, highlighting the political tensions and rivalries that characterized the era. The nature of their interaction indicates that Wang Zifu may possess information that could either incriminate him further or provide insights into the conspiracy's broader implications.\n\nThe dynamics between Cao Cao and Wang Zifu reflect the intricate web of alliances and enmities that defined the political landscape of the time. As Cao Cao questions Wang Zifu, the stakes are high, with the potential for significant repercussions depending on the revelations that may arise from their exchange.
