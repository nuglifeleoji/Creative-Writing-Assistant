No. But the effects of this union will be profound.”\n“I listened while you were talking to Moneo,” Idaho said. “I thought it must be some kind of joke,a.. .”\n“Careful, Duncan!”\n“Do you Jove her?”\n“More deeply than any man ever loved a woman.”\n“Well, what about her? Does she...”\n“She feels ... a compelling compassion, a need to share with me, to give whatever she can give. It is her nature.”\nIdaho suppressed a feeling of revulsion.\n“Moneo’s right. They'll believe the Tleilaxu stories.”\n“That is one of the profound effects.”\n“And you still want me to... to mate with Siona!”\n“You know my wishes. | leave the choice to you.”\n“Who's that Nayla woman?”\n“You've met Nayla! Good.”\n“She and Siona act like sisters. That big hunk! What’s going on there, Leto?”\n“What would you want to go on? And what does it matter?”\n“I’ve never met such a brute! She reminds me of Beast Rabban. You’d never know she was female if she didn’t...”\n“You have met her before,” Leto said. “You knew her as Friend.”\nIdaho stared at him in quick silence, the silence of a burrowing creature who senses the hawk.\n“Then you trust her,” Idaho said.\n“Trust? What is trust?”\nThe moment arrives, Leto thought. He could see it Shaping in Idaho’s thoughts.\n“Trust is what goes with a pledge of loyalty,” Idaho said.\n“Such as the trust between you and me?” Leto asked.\nA bitter smile touched Idaho’s lips. “So that’s what you’re doing with Hwi Noree? A marriage, a pledge...”\n“Hwi and | already have trust for each other.”\n“Do you trust me, Leto?”\n“If | cannot trust Duncan Idaho, | cannot trust anyone.”\n“And if | can’t trust you?”\n“Then | pity you.”\nIdaho took this as almost a physical shock. His eyes were wide with unspoken demands. He wanted to trust. He wanted the magic which would never come again.\nIdaho indicated his thoughts were taking off in an odd tangent then.\n“Can they hear us out in the anteroom?” he asked.\n“No.” But my journals hear!\n“Moneo was furious. Anyone could see it. But he went away like a docile lamb.”\n“Moneo is an aristocrat. He is married to duty, to responsibilities. When he is reminded of these things, his anger vanishes.”\n“So that’s how you control him,” Idaho said.\n“He controls himself,” Leto said, remembering how Moneo had glanced up from the notetaking, not for reassurances, but to prompt his sense of duty.\n“No,” Idaho said. “He doesn’t control himself. You do it.”\n“Moneo has locked himse/f into his past. | did not do that.”\n“But he’s an aristocrat... an Atreides.”\nLeto recalled Moneo’s aging features, thinking how inevitable it was that the aristocrat would refuse his final duty—which was to step aside and vanish into history. He would have to be driven aside. And he would be. No aristocrat had ever overcome the demands of change.\nIdaho was not through. “Are you an aristocrat, Leto?”\nLeto smiled. “The ultimate aristocrat dies within me.” And he thought: Privilege becomes arrogance. Arrogance promotes injustice. The seeds of ruin blossom.\n“Maybe I will not attend your wedding,” Idaho said. “I never thought of myself as an aristocrat.”\n“But you were. You were the aristocrat of the sword.”\n“Paul was better,” Idaho said.\nLeto spoke in the voice of Muad’Dib: “Because you taught me!” He resumed his normal tones: “The aristocrat’s unspoken duty—to teach, and sometimes by horrible example.”\nAnd he thought: Pride of birth trails out into penury and the weaknesses of interbreeding. The way is opened for pride of wealth and accomplishment. Enter the nouveaux riches, riding to power as the Harkonnens did, on the backs of the ancient régime.\nThe cycle repeated itself with such persistence that Leto felt anyone should have seen how it must be built into long forgotten survival patterns which the species had outgrown, but never lost.\nBut no, we still carry the detritus which | must weed out.\n“Is there some frontier?” Idaho asked. “Is there some frontier where | could go and never again be a part of this?”\n“If there is to be any frontier, you must help me create it,” Leto said. “There is now no place to go where others of us cannot follow and find you.”\n“Then you won't let me go.”\n“Go if you wish. Others of you have tried it. | tell you there is no frontier, no place to hide. Right now, as it has been for a long, long time, humankind is like a single-celled creature, bound together by a dangerous glue.”\n“No new planets? No strange...”\n“Oh, we grow, but we do not separate.”\n“Because you hold us together!” he accused.\n“| do not know if you can understand this, Duncan, but if there is a frontier, any kind of frontier, then what lies behind you cannot be more important than what lies ahead.”\n“You're the past!”\n“No, Moneo is the past. He is quick to raise the traditional aristocratic barriers against all frontiers. You must understand the power of those barriers. They not only enclose planets and land on those planets, they enclose ideas. They repress change.”\n“You repress change!”\nHe will not deviate, Leto thought. One more try.\n“The surest sign that an aristocracy exists is the discovery of barriers against change, curtains of iron or steel or stone or of any substance which excludes the new, the different.”\n“I know there must be a frontier somewhere,” Idaho said. “You're hiding it.”\n“I hide nothing of frontiers. | want frontiers! | want Surprises!”\nThey come right up against it, Leto thought. Then they refuse to enter.\nTrue to this prediction, Idaho’s thoughts darted off ona new tack. “Did you really have Face Dancers perform at your betrothal?”\nLeto felt a surge of anger, followed immediately by a wry enjoyment of the fact that he could experience the emotion in such depth. He wanted to let it shout at Duncan... but that would solve nothing.\n“The Face Dancers performed,” he said.\n“Why?”\n“I want everyone to share in my happiness.”\nIdaho stared at him as though just discovering a repellent insect in his drink. In a flat voice, Idaho said: “That is the most cynical thing | have ever heard an Atreides say.”\n“But an Atreides said it.”\n“You're deliberately trying to put me off! You’re avoiding my question.”\nOnce more into the fray, Leto thought. He said: “The Face Dancers of the Bene Tleilax are a colony organism. Individually, they are mules. This is a choice they made for and by themselves.”\nLeto waited, thinking: / must be patient. They have to discover it for themselves. If I say it, they will not believe. Think, Duncan. Think!\nAfter a long silence, Idaho said: “I have given you my oath. That is important to me. It is still important. | don’t know what you’re doing or why. | can only say | don’t like what’s happening. There! I’ve said it.”\n“Is that why you returned from the Citadel?”\n“Yes!”\n“Will you go back to the Citadel now?”\n“What other frontier is there?”\n“Very good, Duncan! Your anger knows even when your reason does not. Hwi goes to the Citadel tonight. | will join her there tomorrow.”\n“I want to get to know her better,” Idaho said.\n“You will avoid her,” Leto said. “That is an order. Hwi is not for you.”\n“I’ve always known there were witches,” Idaho said. “Your grandmother was one.”\nHe turned on his heel and, not asking leave, strode back the way he had come.\nHow like a little boy he is, Leto thought, watching the stiffness in Idaho’s back. The oldest man in our universe and the youngest—both in one flesh.\nThe prophet is not diverted by illusions of past, present and future. The fixity of language determines such linear distinctions. Prophets hold a key to the lock in a language. The mechanical image remains only an image to them. This is not a mechanical universe. The linear progression of events is imposed by the observer. Cause and effect? That’s not it at all. The prophet utters fateful words. You glimpse a thing “destined to occur.” But the prophetic instant releases something of infinite portent and power. The universe undergoes a ghostly shift. Thus, the wise prophet conceals actuality behind shimmering labels. The uninitiated then believe the prophetic language is ambiguous. The listener distrusts the prophetic messenger. Instinct tells you how the utterance blunts the power of such words. The best prophets lead you up to the curtain and let you peer through for yourself.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nBe addressed Moneo in the coldest voice he had ever used: “The Duncan disobeys me.”\nThey were in the airy room of golden stone atop the Citadel’s south tower, Leto’s third full day back from the Decennial Festival in Onn. An open portal beside him looked out over the harsh noonday of the Sareer. The wind made a deep humming sound through the opening. It stirred up dust and sand which made Moneo squint. Leto seemed not to notice the irritation. He stared out across the Sareer, where the air was alive with heat movements. The distant flow of dunes suggested a mobility in the landscape which only his eyes observed.\nMoneo stood immersed in the sour odors of his own fear, knowing that the wind conveyed the message of these odors to Leto’s senses. The arrangements for the wedding, the upset among the Fish Speakers—everything was paradox. It reminded Moneo of something the God Emperor had said in the first days of their association.\n“Paradox is a pointer telling you to look beyond it. If paradoxes bother you, that betrays your deep desire for absolutes. The relativist treats a paradox merely as interesting, perhaps amusing or even, dreadful thought, educational.”\n“You do not respond,” Leto said. He turned from his examination of the Sareer and focused the weight of his attention on Moneo.\nMoneo could only shrug. How near is the Worm? he wondered. Moneo had noticed that the return to the Citadel from Onn sometimes aroused the Worm. No sign of that awful shift in the God Emperor’s presence had yet betrayed itself, but Moneo sensed it. Could the Worm come without warning?\n“Accelerate arrangements for the wedding,” Leto said. “Make it as soon as possible.”\n“Before you test Siona?”\nLeto was silent fora moment, then: “No. What will you do about the Duncan?”\n“What would you have me do, Lord?”\n“I told him not to see Noree, to avoid her. | told him it was an order.”\n“She has sympathy for him, Lord. Nothing more.”\n“Why would she have sympathy for him?”\n“He is a ghola. He has no connection to our times, no\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a central figure in the narrative who is planning a marriage and discussing profound effects of his actions with Duncan Idaho.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola, a clone of the original Duncan Idaho, who is in a complex relationship with Leto and questions his motives.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWEE NOREE<|>PERSON<|>Hwi Noree is the woman Leto plans to marry, described as having a compelling compassion and a need to share with Leto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is an aristocrat and a loyal servant of Leto, married to duty and responsibilities.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a character who acts like a sister to Nayla and is involved in the events surrounding Leto's plans.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAYLA<|>PERSON<|>Nayla is a brute-like woman who reminds Duncan Idaho of Beast Rabban and is known as Friend.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>GEO<|>The Citadel is a location where significant events take place, including discussions between Leto and Duncan Idaho.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAREE<|>GEO<|>The Sareer is a desert landscape observed by Leto from the Citadel's south tower.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONN<|>GEO<|>Onn is the location of the Decennial Festival, from which Leto returns to the Citadel.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Tleilax are known for their Face Dancers, who performed at Leto's betrothal.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are a group upset by the arrangements for Leto's wedding.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEDDING<|>EVENT<|>The wedding is a significant event being planned by Leto and Moneo, with profound effects anticipated.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Leto and Duncan Idaho have a complex relationship, with Leto trusting Duncan deeply but Duncan questioning Leto's motives.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>HWEE NOREE<|>Leto plans to marry Hwi Noree, describing their relationship as one of deep trust and compassion.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>MONEO<|>Leto and Moneo have a master-servant relationship, with Moneo being loyal to Leto and his duties.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>NAYLA<|>Duncan Idaho has met Nayla before, known as Friend, and finds her brutish.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>HWEE NOREE<|>Duncan Idaho is ordered by Leto to avoid Hwi Noree, indicating a potential conflict.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Moneo is involved in the arrangements for the wedding, which has upset the Fish Speakers.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>BENE TLEILAX<|>Leto had Face Dancers from the Bene Tleilax perform at his betrothal, indicating a relationship.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>WEDDING<|>Leto is the central figure in the wedding event, which is being accelerated.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>CITADEL<|>Duncan Idaho returns from the Citadel and questions Leto about his actions.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SAREE<|>Leto observes the Sareer from the Citadel, indicating a connection to the landscape.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
