忽帐下一老将，厉声而进曰：“我虽年迈，尚有廉颇之勇，马援之雄。此二古人皆不服老，何故不用我耶？”众视之，乃赵云也。孔明曰：“吾自平南回都，马孟起病故，吾甚惜之，以为折一臂也。今将军年纪已高，倘稍有参差，动摇一世英名，减却蜀中锐气。”云厉声曰：“吾自随先帝以来，临阵不退，遇敌则先。大丈夫得死于疆场者，幸也，吾何恨焉？愿为前部先锋！”孔明再三苦劝不住。云曰：“如不教我为先锋，就撞死于阶下！”孔明曰：“将军既要为先锋，须得一人同去。”言未尽，一人应曰：“某虽不才，愿助老将军先引一军前去破敌。”孔明视之，乃邓芝也。孔明大喜，即拨精兵五千。副将十员，随赵云、邓芝去讫。\n\n    孔明出师，后主引百官送于北门外十里。孔明辞了后主，旌旗蔽野，戈戟如林，率军望汉中迤逦进发。却说边庭探知此事，报入洛阳。是日曹睿设朝，近臣奏曰：“边官报称：诸葛亮率领大兵三十余万，出屯汉中，令赵云、邓芝为前部先锋，引兵入境。”睿大惊，问群臣曰：“谁可为将，以退蜀兵？”忽一人应声而出曰：“臣父死于汉中，切齿之恨，未尝得报。今蜀兵犯境，臣愿引本部猛将，更乞陛下赐关西之兵，前往破蜀，上为国家效力，下报父仇，臣万死不恨！”众视之，乃夏侯渊之子夏侯楙也。楙字子休，其性最急，又最吝，自幼嗣与夏侯惇为子。后夏侯渊为黄忠所斩，曹操怜之，以女清河公主招楙为驸马，因此朝中钦敬。虽掌兵权，未尝临阵。当时自请出征，曹睿即命为大都督，调关西诸路军马前去迎敌。司徒王朗谏曰：“不可。夏侯驸马素不曾经战，今付以大任，非其所宜。更兼诸葛亮足智多谋，深通韧略，不可轻敌。”夏侯楙叱曰：“司徒莫非结连诸葛亮，欲为内应耶？吾自幼从父学习韬略，深通兵法。汝何欺我年幼？吾若不生擒诸葛亮，誓不回见天子！”王朗等皆不敢言。夏侯楙辞了魏主，星夜到长安，调关西诸路军马二十余万，来敌孔明。正是：欲秉白旄摩将士，却教黄吻掌兵权。未知胜负如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第九十二回　赵子龙力斩五将　诸葛\n######################\nOutput:",
