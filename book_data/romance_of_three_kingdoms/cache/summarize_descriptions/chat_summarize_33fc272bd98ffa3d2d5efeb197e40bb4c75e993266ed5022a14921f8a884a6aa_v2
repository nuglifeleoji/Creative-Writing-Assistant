As 刘备's chief strategist,孔明 plays a crucial role in advising him on military strategies, which highlights the strong advisor-commander relationship between the two. This partnership is characterized by孔明's deep understanding of military tactics and his ability to provide Liu Bei with insightful counsel that is instrumental in his campaigns.\n\n孔明 is recognized as an important谋士 (military advisor) for 刘备, contributing significantly to Liu Bei's ambitions to restore the Han dynasty. His strategic acumen not only aids in military endeavors but also aligns with Liu Bei's overarching goal of reviving the Han dynasty, which had been fragmented and weakened during the tumultuous period of the Three Kingdoms. This shared vision for the restoration of the Han dynasty solidifies their alliance and underscores孔明's vital role in Liu Bei's quest for power and legitimacy.\n\nIn summary,孔明 serves as a key advisor to刘备, providing essential military strategies that support Liu Bei's aspirations to revive the Han dynasty.
