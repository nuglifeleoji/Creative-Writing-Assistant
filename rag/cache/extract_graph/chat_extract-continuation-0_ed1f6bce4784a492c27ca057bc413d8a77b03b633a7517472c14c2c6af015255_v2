Within the month, Alia had been married to Paul’s swordmaster, Duncan Idaho, a mentat brought back from the dead by the arts of the Tleilaxu. Her mother fled back to Caladan. Paul’s twins were Alia’s legal charge.\nAnd she controlled the Regency.\nPressures of responsibility had driven the old fears away and she had been wide open to the inner lives, demanding their advice, plunging into spice trance in search of guiding visions.\nThe crisis came on a day like many others in the spring month of Laab, a clear morning at Muad’Dib’s Keep with a cold wind blowing down from the pole. Alia still wore the yellow for mourning, the color of the sterile sun. More and more these past few weeks she’d been denying the inner voice of her mother, who tended to sneer at preparation for the coming Holy Days to be centered on the Temple.\nThe inner-awareness of Jessica faded, faded... sinking away at last with a faceless demand that Alia would be\nbetter occupied working on the Atreides Law. New lives began to clamor for their moment of consciousness. Alia felt that she had opened a bottomless pit, and faces arose out of it like a swarm of locusts, until she came at last to focus on one who was like a beast: the old Baron Harkonnen. In terrified outrage she had screamed out against all of that inner clamor, winning a temporary silence.\nOn this morning, Alia took her pre-breakfast walk through the Keep’s roof garden. In a new attempt to win the inner battle, she tried to hold her entire awareness within Choda’s admonition to the Zensunni:\n“Leaving the ladder, one may fall upward!”\nBut morning’s glow along the cliffs of the Shield Wall kept distracting her. Plantings of resilient fuzz-grass filled the garden’s pathways. When she looked away from the Shield Wall she saw dew on the grass, the catch of all the moisture which had passed here in the night. It reflected her own passage as of a multitude.\nThat multitude made her giddy. Each reflection carried the imprint of a face from the inner multitude.\nShe tried to focus her mind on what the grass implied. The presence of plentiful dew told her how far the ecological transformation had progressed on Arrakis. The climate of these northern latitudes was growing warmer; atmospheric carbon dioxide was on the increase. She reminded herself how many new hectares would be put under green plants in the coming year—and it required thirty-seven thousand cubic feet of water to irrigate just one hectare.\nDespite every attempt at mundane thoughts, she could not drive away the sharklike circling of all those others within her.\nShe put her hands to her forehead and pressed.\nHer temple guards had brought her a prisoner to judge at sunset the previous day: one Essas Paymon, a dark little man ostensibly in the pay of a house minor, the Nebiros, who traded in holy artifacts and small manufactured items\nfor decoration. Actually Paymon was known to be a CHOAM spy whose task was to assess the yearly spice crop. Alia had been on the point of sending him into the dungeons when he’d protested loudly “the injustice of the Atreides.” That could have brought him an immediate sentence of death on the hanging tripod, but Alia had been caught by his boldness. She’d spoken sternly from her Throne of Judgment, trying to frighten him into revealing more than he’d already told her inquisitors.\n“Why are our spice crops of such interest to the Combine Honnete?” she demanded. “Tell us and we may Spare you.” “I only collect something for which there is a market,” Paymon said. “I know nothing of what is done with my\nharvest.”\n“And for this petty profit you interfere with our royal plans?” Alia demanded.\n“Royalty never considers that we might have plans, too,” he countered.\nAlia, captivated by his desperate audacity, said: “Essas Paymon, will you work for me?”\nAt this a grin whitened his dark face, and he said: “You were about to obliterate me without a qualm. What is my new value that you should suddenly make a market for it?”\n“You've a simple and practical value,” she said. “You’re bold and you're for hire to the highest bidder. | can bid higher than any other in the Empire.”\nAt which, he named a remarkable sum which he required for his services, but Alia laughed and countered with a figure she considered more reasonable and undoubtedly far more than he’d ever before received. She added: “And, of course, | throw in the gift of your life upon which, | presume, you place an even more inordinate value.”\n“A bargain!” Paymon cried and, at a signal from Alia, was led away by her priestly Master of Appointments, Ziarenko Javid.\nLess than an hour later, as Alia prepared to leave the Judgment Hall, Javid came hurrying to report that Paymon had been overheard to mutter the fateful lines from the Orange Catholic Bible: “Maleficos non patieris vivere.”\n“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,” Alia translated. So that was his gratitude! He was one of those who plotted against her very life! In a flush of rage such as she’d never before experienced, she ordered Paymon’s immediate execution, sending his body to the Temple deathstill where his water, at least, would be of some value in the priestly coffers.\nAnd all night long Paymon’s dark face haunted her.\nShe tried all of her tricks against this persistent, accusing image, reciting the Bu Ji from the Fremen Book of Kreos: “Nothing occurs! Nothing occurs!” But Paymon took her through a wearing night into this giddy new day, where she could see that his face had joined those in the jeweled reflections from the dew.\nA female guard called her to breakfast from the roof door behind a low hedge of mimosa. Alia sighed. She felt small choice between hells: the outcry within her mind or the outcry from her attendants—all were pointless voices, but persistent in their demands, hourglass noises that she would like to silence with the edge of a knife.\nIgnoring the guard, Alia stared across the roof garden toward the Shield Wall. A bahada had left its broad outwash like a detrital fan upon the sheltered floor of her domain. The delta of sand spread out before her gaze, outlined by the morning sun. It came to her that an uninitiated eye might see that broad fan as evidence of a river’s flow, but it was no more than the place where her brother had shattered the Shield Wall with the Atreides Family atomics, opening a path from the desert for the sandworms which had carried his Fremen troops to shocking victory over his Imperial predecessor, Shaddam IV. Now a broad qanat flowed with water on the Shield Wall’s far side to block off\nsandworm intrusions. Sandworms would not cross open water; it poisoned them.\nWould that | had such a barrier within my mind, she thought.\nThe thought increased her giddy sensation of being separated from reality.\nSandworms! Sandworms!\nHer memory presented a collection of sandworm images: mighty Shai-Hulud, the demiurge of the Fremen, deadly beast of the desert’s depths whose outpourings included the priceless spice. How odd it was, this sandworm, to grow from a flat and leathery sandtrout, she thought. They were like the flocking multitude within her awareness. The sandtrout, when linked edge to edge against the planet’s bedrock, formed living cisterns; they held back the water that their sandworm vector might live. Alia could feel the analogy: some of those others within her mind held back dangerous forces which could destroy her.\nAgain the guard called her to breakfast, a note of impatience apparent.\nAngrily Alia turned, waved a dismissal signal.\nThe guard obeyed, but the roof door slammed.\nAt the sound of the slamming door, Alia felt herself caught by everything she had attempted to deny. The other lives welled up within her like a hideous tide. Each demanding life pressed its face against her vision centers— a cloud of faces. Some presented mange-spotted skin, other were callous and full of sooty shadows; there were mouths like moist lozenges. The pressure of the swarm washed over her in a current which demanded that she float free and plunge into them.\n“No,” she whispered. “No...no...no...”\nShe would have collapsed onto the path but for a bench beside her which accepted her sagging body. She tried to sit, could not, stretched out on the cold plasteel, still whispering denial.\nThe tide continued to rise within her.\nShe felt attuned to the slightest show of attention, aware of the risk, but alert for every exclamation from those guarded mouths which clamored within her. They were a cacophony of demand for her attention: “Me! Me!” “No, me!” And she knew that if she once gave her attention, gave it completely, she would be lost. To behold one face out of the multitude and follow the voice of that face would be to be held by the egocentrism which shared her existence.\n“Prescience does this to you,” a voice whispered.\nShe covered her ears with her hands, thinking: /’m not prescient! The trance doesn’t work for me!\nBut the voice persisted: “/t might work, if you had help.”\n“No... no,” she whispered.\nOther voices wove around her mind: “I, Agamemnon, your ancestor, demand audience!”\n“No...no.” She pressed her hands against her ears until the flesh answered her with pain.\nAn insane cackle within her head asked: “What has become of Ovid? Simple. He’s John Bartlett’s ibid!”\nThe names were meaningless in her extremity. She wanted to scream against them and against all the other voices but could not find her own voice.\nHer guard, sent back to the roof by senior attendants, peered once more from the doorway behind the mimosa, saw Alia on the bench, spoke to a companion: “Ahhh, she is resting. You noted that she didn’t sleep well last night. It is good for her to take the zaha, the morning siesta.”\nAlia did not hear her guard. Her awareness was caught by shrieks of singing: “Merry old birds are we, hurrah!” the voices echoed against the inside of her skull and she thought: /’m going insane, I’m losing my mind.\nHer feet made feeble fleeing motions against the bench. She felt that if she could only command her body to run, she might escape. She had to escape lest any part of that inner\ntide sweep her into silence, forever contaminating her soul. But her body would not obey. The mightiest forces in the Imperial universe would obey her slightest whim, but her body would not.\nAn inner voice chuckled. Then: “From one viewpoint, child, each incident of creation represents a catastrophe.” It was a basso voice which rumbled against her eyes, and again that chuckle as though deriding its own pontification. “My dear child, | will help you, but you must help me in return.”\nAgainst the swelling background clamor behind that basso voice, Alia spoke through chattering teeth: “Who... who...”\nA face formed itself upon her awareness. It was a smiling face of such fatness that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit are a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, known for their judgment and influence over the universe\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia Atreides is the sister of Paul Atreides, a pre-born with ancestral memories, and the Regent of the Empire\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, is the Emperor of the known universe and Alia's brother\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a mentat and swordmaster, resurrected by the Tleilaxu, and married to Alia\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and amoral faction known for their genetic engineering and resurrection technologies\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is the ancestral home of House Atreides, where Jessica fled after Alia's marriage\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis, also known as Dune, is the desert planet and the source of the spice melange\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHIELD WALL<|>GEO<|>The Shield Wall is a massive geological feature on Arrakis, shattered by Paul Atreides to secure victory\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>EVENT<|>Shai-Hulud refers to the sandworms of Arrakis, worshipped by the Fremen as demiurges and central to spice production\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HOLY DAYS<|>EVENT<|>The Holy Days are religious observances centered on the Temple, which Alia is preparing for\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ESSAS PAYMON<|>PERSON<|>Essas Paymon is a CHOAM spy captured by Alia, later executed for plotting against her\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHOAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CHOAM is the Combine Honnete, a powerful economic entity controlling trade across the universe\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEBEIROS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Nebiros is a minor house trading in holy artifacts and decorative items\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>PERSON<|>The Baron Harkonnen is a historical enemy of House Atreides, whose memories haunt Alia\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHADDAM IV<|>PERSON<|>Shaddam IV is the deposed Emperor defeated by Paul Atreides\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Alia is a pre-born with Bene Gesserit abilities and ancestral memories<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>PAUL<|>Alia is Paul's sister and serves as his Regent<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Alia is married to Duncan Idaho<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLEILAXU<|>Duncan Idaho was resurrected by the Tleilaxu<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>CALADAN<|>Alia's mother fled back to Caladan<|>4\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>ARRAKIS<|>Alia rules from Arrakis and oversees its ecological transformation<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SHIELD WALL<|>Paul shattered the Shield Wall to win his victory<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SHADDAM IV<|>Paul defeated Shaddam IV to become Emperor<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>ESSAS PAYMON<|>Alia captured and later executed Essas Paymon for treason<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ESSAS PAYMON<|>CHOAM<|>Essas Paymon was a spy for CHOAM<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>Alia is haunted by the memories of the Baron Harkonnen<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>HOLY DAYS<|>Alia is preparing for the Holy Days at the Temple<|>6\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
