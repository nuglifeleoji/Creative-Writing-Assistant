自从那次田福堂看见他和润叶坐在河湾里以后，孙少安就知道，不定什么时候，田福堂就会用拐弯“马”来将他一军。田福堂下这类“棋”，通常都走“马”而不用“车”，因此别人很难防他。他没想到，田福堂果然这么快就给他下了如此厉害的一着“棋”。 \n　　少安站在台子前，尽管头低着，但他还是用眼睛的余光在一片人群中搜寻到了田福堂。少安看他坐在那么一个角落里，心里就更明白了。是的，他心亏，不敢正视他。他得到了一些安慰：从某种意义说，他和田福堂都在接受批判；他接受思想的批判，田福堂接受良心的批判。 \n　　在确认了“犹大”以后，孙少安索性再不想这件事了。不管怎样，田福堂就是田福堂。他不这样就不是田福堂了。谁也不能改变田福堂，连他自己也改变不了自己。 \n　　话说回来，少安知道田福堂对他和润叶那次的会面心中有气。平心静气地想，这种“报复”也情有可原。是呀，他那样体面的人家，自己如花似玉的工作女儿，怎么能让一个泥腿把子去沾染呢？ \n　　少安现在感到欣慰的是，他对润叶的求爱采取了完全正确的态度。田福堂现在又用铁的逻辑进一步给他论证了这件事的不可能性…… \n　　他现在感到难受和丧气的是，这个批判将会把他在全公社扬臭了。他别再指望在这个天地里给自己寻找一个媳妇。哪怕加倍地掏财礼钱，也不会有人把女儿嫁给一个丧失了名誉的人！ \n　　使他更为难受的是，他担心由于他的这件事会影响少平和兰香将来的前途。他终归已经是农民，他不怕什么，难道连老镢把也握不成了吗？但少平和兰香与他不一样，以后要是有个出门的机会，会不会受这件事的“政治影响”呢？如果影响到他两个人，他就会痛苦一辈子的……少安难受地前前后后思量着这件事，在一片闹哄声中总算熬完了批判会。 \n　　好在批判完了也就完了，公社主任白明川还在结束时对他们五个人说了点鼓励话，让他们不要背包袱，回去好好抓生产，将功补过……” \n　　等众人散尽以后，少安才无精打采地出了公社院子，来到石圪节的街上。 \n　　街上的集市已经快接近尾声。少安走过街道的时候，不时感觉有人在指划着议论他。 \n　　他突然看见父亲和妹妹从一个拐角处向他迎面走来。他很快迎上前去对他们说：“你们来干什么哩？我没什么……” \n　　他父亲说：“我在家里心焦得坐不定，跑来看人家倒究怎样处理你呀……” \n　　少安对父亲和妹妹说：“已经完了，再也不会怎样……你们不要�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂 is a
