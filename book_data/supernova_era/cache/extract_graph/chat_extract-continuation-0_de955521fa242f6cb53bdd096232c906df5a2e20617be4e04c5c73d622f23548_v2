“电视连续剧常出现这种画面，本来我不太想这样做，不过也算是一种形式吧。”说着他当着靖子面前打开盒子，是戒指，大大的钻石绽放出细碎璨光。\n    “工藤先生……”靖子愕然凝视着工藤。\n    “用不着现在立刻答复没关系。”他说，“我知道还得考虑美里的感受，当然首先你的想法也很重要。不过我只希望你明白我绝非抱着玩玩的心态。现在的我，绝对有信心让你们母女幸福。”他拉起靖子的手，把盒子放在她掌上。“就算收下了你也不用心理负担，这只是一个礼物。不过如果你决心和我共度下半生，那这枚戒指就有它的意义了。你愿意考虑看看吗？”\n    靖子的掌心感受着小盒子的分量，不禁仓皇失措。她太惊讶了，以致于他的表白连一半都没听进去，但她还是弄懂了他的意图。正因为懂得，所以心理才更混乱。\n    “抱歉，我好像有点太唐突了。”工藤浮现腼腆的笑容，“你真的不用急着回答。跟美里商量一下也好。”说着就把靖子手上的盒子盖起来。“拜托你了。”\n    靖子想不出该说什么，千头万绪在脑中来回穿梭，包括石神的事――不，或许该说那占了大半。\n    “我会……考虑看看。”她费尽力气才挤出这句话。\n    工藤欣然地点点头，靖子这才下车。\n    目送他的车子远去后，她才回家。打开房门时，她瞥向隔壁那扇门。虽然塞满了邮件，却没有报纸。想必是石神去警局投案前就已把报纸停掉了。这点心思，对他来说肯定不算什么。美里还没回来，靖子瘫坐在地，长长吐出一口气。然后突然念头一转，打开旁边的抽屉，取出塞在最里面的点心盒，打开盖子。那是用来装旧邮件的盒子，她从最低下抽出一个信封。信封上什么也没写，里面有一张报告用纸，写满密密麻麻的字迹。\n    那是石神打最后一通电话前，放进靖子家信箱的。除了这张纸本来还有三个信封，里面装的每一封信都足以证明他在疯狂纠缠靖子，现在那三封信在警察手上。\n    这张纸上针对三封信的用法、当刑警来找她时该怎么应答等等，都有详细的说明。不只是对靖子，还写了对美里的指示。在那详细的说明中，缀满了他预估各种状况、好让花冈母女无论受到任何质问都不会动摇的细心顾虑。因此靖子和美里，才能毫不仓皇、理直气壮的与刑警对峙。当时靖子觉得，如果这时候应付得不好让人看穿谎言，就会害石神的一片苦心化为泡影，想必美里也有同样的想法。\n    这些指示的最后，还补上这么一段。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>工藤<|>PERSON<|>工藤 is a character who proposes to 靖子 with a diamond ring, expressing
