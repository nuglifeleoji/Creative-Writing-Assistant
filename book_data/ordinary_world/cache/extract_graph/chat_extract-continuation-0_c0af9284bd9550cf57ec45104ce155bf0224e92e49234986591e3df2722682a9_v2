当钉鞋匠，李登云夫妇尽管心里仍然有些“那个”，最后也都勉强同意了。唉，是呀，对他们来说，仍然还存在个“面子”问题，但只要儿媳妇乐意，他们还再能说什么呢？ \n　　润叶立刻亲自出马，为丈夫办好了营业执照。按市工商局管理规定，鞋匠一律要在二道街熟食摊对面营业。向前在家做各种准备，润叶又跑着为他“买”了个干活的地皮和一个按市容要求而特制的铁框图；铁框图挂上一些醒目的红布条以及写着“李记钉鞋铺”的招牌……这其间，武惠良曾匆匆到他们家来过一次。地委已决定调他去润叶和向前家乡原西县去任县委书记。前团地委书记是来向他们夫妻告别的。惠良已和丽丽办了离婚手续。这对当年的恩爱夫妻终干在时代的大潮中分手了。他们的分手是友好的；因为迄今为止，他们实际上仍然存着相爱的感情。关于他们各自未来的个人生活安排，现在还很难预测，杜丽丽声称，她一辈子准备过独身生活。她举列说，当代中国许多著名女作家都离了婚过独身生活，这有利于创作事业。她和省上“第五代人”诗人古风铃的关系依然照旧；尽管见面不多，但两地书信不断。 \n　　武惠良正是因为家庭关系破裂，才主动要求到下面去工作的——他要离开这伤心之地。他将是黄原地区最年轻的县委书记。最近，据说他读了许多书。他肯定还是一个前程远大的青年。青年，青年！无论怎样的挫折和打击，都要咬着牙关挺住，因为你们完全有机会重建生活；只要不灰心丧气，每一次挫折就只不过是通往新境界的一块普通的绊脚石，而绝不会致人于死命。人啊，忍、韧、仁……润叶最近几天抽不出时间去看望与丈夫离异的丽丽，因为她要忙着让自己的丈夫“出山”。 \n　　一切手续就绪以后，李向前就在二道街重新“就业”了。他旁边是其他十几位钉鞋匠——这将是他以后生活中主要的竞争对手。他斜对面就是诗人贾冰的老婆卖羊杂碎的小饭铺。由于妻子和贾冰是熟人，向前和贾冰的老婆也很快熟悉了；在客不多的时候，这两个个体户生意人还隔街拉呱家常话哩！ \n　　早晨，向前是自己坐着轮椅去“上班”的；他的钉鞋工具通常都寄存在贾冰老婆的饭铺里。 \n　　傍晚，每当下班的贾冰来到对面帮老婆卖羊杂碎的时候，他的润叶也会准时来到这里——她是来接他回家的。 \n　　她把他的钉鞋工具通常都寄存在对面的饭铺，然后就扶他坐上�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
