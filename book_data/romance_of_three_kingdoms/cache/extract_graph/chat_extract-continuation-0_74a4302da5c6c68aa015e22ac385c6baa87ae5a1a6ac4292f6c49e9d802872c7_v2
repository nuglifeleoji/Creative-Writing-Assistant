�六年为炎兴元年，日与宦官黄皓在宫中游乐。忽接姜维之表，即召黄皓问曰：“今魏国遣钟会、邓艾大起人马，分道而来，如之奈何？”皓奏曰：“此乃姜维欲立功名，故上此表。陛下宽心，勿生疑虑。臣闻城中有一师婆，供奉一神，能知吉凶，可召来问之。”后主从其言，于后殿陈设香花纸烛、享祭礼物，令黄皓用小车请入宫中，坐于龙床之上。后主焚香祝毕，师婆忽然披发跣足，就殿上跳跃数十遍，盘旋于案上。皓曰：“此神人降矣。陛下可退左右，亲祷之。”后主尽退侍臣，再拜祝之。师婆大叫曰：“吾乃西川土神也。陛下欣乐太平，何为求问他事？数年之后，魏国疆土亦归陛下矣。陛下切勿忧虑。”言讫，昏倒于地，半晌方苏。后主大喜，重加赏赐。自此深信师婆之说，遂不听姜维之言，每日只在宫中饮宴欢乐。姜维累申告急表文，皆被黄皓隐匿，因此误了大事。却说钟会大军，迤逦望汉中进发。前军先锋许仪，要立头功，先领兵至南郑关。仪谓部将曰：“过此关即汉中矣。关上不多人马，我等便可奋力抢关。”众将领命，一齐并力向前。原来守关蜀将卢逊，早知魏兵将到，先于关前木桥左右，伏下军士，装起武侯所遗十矢连弩；比及许仪兵来抢关时，一声梆子响处，矢石如雨。仪急退时，早射倒数十骑。魏兵大败。仪回报钟会。会自提帐下甲士百余骑来看，果然箭弩一齐射下。会拨马便回，关上卢逊引五百军杀下来。会拍马过桥，桥上土塌，陷住马蹄，争些儿掀下马来。马挣不起，会弃马步行；跑下桥时，卢逊赶上，一枪刺来，却被魏兵中荀恺回身一箭，射卢逊落马。钟会麾众乘势抢关，关上军士因有蜀兵在关前，不敢放箭，被钟会杀散，夺了山关。即以荀恺为护军，以全副鞍马铠甲赐之。\n\n    会唤许仪至帐下，责之曰：“汝为先锋，理合逢山开路，遇水叠桥，专一修理桥梁道路，以便行军。吾方才到桥上，陷住马蹄，几乎堕桥；若非荀恺，吾已被杀矣！汝既违军令，当按军法！”叱左右推出斩之。诸将告曰：“其父许褚有功于朝廷，望都督恕之。”会怒曰：“军法不明，何以令众？”遂令斩首示众。诸将无不骇然。时蜀将王含守乐城，蒋斌守\n######################\nOutput:",
