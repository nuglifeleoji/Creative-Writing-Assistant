"completion_tokens": 0}}, "input": {"input": [" Superior’s personal attention at the last minute!\nIt was one of those times when Odrade felt her only possible role was that of official interpreter. Walk to the edge of the stage and tell them what it meant: “Today,\nSisters, we learned that Honored Matres have obliterated four more of our planets. We are that much smaller.”\nOnly twelve planets (including Buzzell) and the faceless hunter with the axe is that much closer.\nOdrade felt the chasm yawning beneath her.\nBellonda had been ordered to contain this latest bad news until a more appropriate moment.\nOdrade looked out the window beside her. What was an appropriate moment for such news?\nThey had been driving south a little more than three hours, the burner-glazed roadway like a green river ahead of them. This passage led them through hillsides of cork oaks that stretched out to ridge-enclosed horizons. The oaks had been allowed to grow gnomelike in less regimented plantations than orchards. There were meandering rows up the hills. The original plantation had been laid out on existing contours, semiterraces now obscured by long brown grass.\n“We grow truffles in there,” Odrade said.\nStreggi had more bad news. “I am told the truffles are in trouble, Mother Superior. Not enough rain.”\nNo more truffles? Odrade hesitated on the edge of bringing a Communications acolyte from the rear and asking Weather if this dryness could be corrected.\nShe glanced back at her attendants. Three rows, four people in each row, specialists to extend her observational powers and carry out orders. And look at that bus following them! One of the larger such vehicles on Chapterhouse. Thirty meters long, at least! Crammed with people! Dust whirled across and around it.\nTamalane rode back there at Odrade’s orders. Mother Superior could be peppery when aroused, everyone thought. Tam had brought too many people but Odrade had discovered it too late for changes.\n“Not an inspection! A damned invasion!” Follow my lead, Tam. A little political drama. Make transition easier.\nShe returned her attention to the driver, only male in this car. Clairby, a vinegary little transport expert. Pinched-up face, skin the color of newly turned damp earth. Odrade’s favorite driver. Fast, safe, and wary of limits of his machine.\nThey crested a hill and cork oaks thinned out, replaced ahead by fruit orchards surrounding a community.\nBeautiful in this light, Odrade thought. Low buildings of white walls and orange-tiled roofs. An arch-shaded entrance street could be seen far down the slope and, in a line behind it, the tall central structure containing regional overview offices.\nThe sight reassured Odrade. The community had a glowing look softened by distance and a haze rising from its ring orchards. Branches still bare up here in this winter belt but surely capable of at least one more crop.\nThe Sisterhood demanded a certain beauty in its surroundings, she reminded herself. A cosseting that provided support for the senses without subtracting from needs of the stomach. Comfort where possible... but not too much!\nSomeone behind Odrade said: “I do believe some of those trees are starting to leaf.”\nOdrade took a more careful look. Yes! Tiny bits of green on dark boughs. Winter had slipped here. Weather Control, struggling to make seasonal shifts, could not prevent occasional mistakes. The expanding desert was creating higher temperatures too early here: odd warming patches that caused plants to leaf or bloom just in time for an abrupt frost. Dieback of plantations was becoming much too common.\nA Field Advisor had dredged up the ancient term “Indian Summer” for a report illustrated by projections of an orchard in full blossom being assaulted by snow. Odrade had felt memory stirring at the advisor’s words.\nIndian Summer. How appropriate!\nHer councillors sharing that little view of their planet’s travail recognized the metaphor of a marauding freeze coming on the heels of inappropriate warmth: an unexpected revival of warm weather, a time when raiders could plague their neighbors.\nRemembering, Odrade felt the chill of the hunter’s axe. How soon? She dared not seek the answer. /’m not a Kwisatz Haderach!\nWithout turning, Odrade spoke to Streggi. “This place, Pondrille, have you ever been here?”\n“It was not my postulant center, Mother Superior, but | presume it is similar.”\nYes, these communities were much alike: mostly low structures set in garden plots and orchards, school centers for specific training. It was a screening system for prospective Sisters, the mesh finer the closer you got to Central.\nSome of these communities such as Pondrille concentrated on toughening their charges. They sent women out for long hours every day to manual labor. Hands that grubbed in dirt and became stained with fruit seldom balked at muckier tasks later in life.\nNow that they were out of the dust, Clairby opened the windows. Heat poured in! What was Weather doing?\nTwo buildings at the edge of Pondrille had been joined one story above the street, forming a long tunnel. All it needed, Odrade thought, was a portcullis to duplicate a town gate out of pre-space history. Armored knights would not find the dusky heat of this entry unfamiliar. It was defined in dark plastone, visually identical to stone. Comeye apertures overhead surely were places where guardians lay in wait.\nThe long, shaded entry to the community was clean, she saw. Nostrils were seldom assailed by rot or other offensive odors in Bene Gesserit communities. No slums. Few cripples hobbling along the walks. Much healthy flesh. Good management took care to keep a healthy population happy.\nWe have our disabled, though. And not all of them physically disabled.\nClairby parked just within the exit from the shaded street and they emerged. Tamalane’s bus pulled to a stop behind them.\nOdrade had hoped the entry passage would provide relief from the heat but perversity of nature had made an oven of the place and the temperature actually increased here. She was glad to pass through into the clear light of the central Square where sweat burning off her body provided a few seconds of coolness.\nThe illusion of relief passed abruptly as the sun scorched her head and shoulders. She was forced to call on metabolic control to adjust her body heat.\nWater splashed in a reflecting circle at the central square, a careless display that soon would have to end.\nLeave it for now. Morale!\nShe heard her companions following, the usual groans against “sitting too long in one position.” A greeting delegation could be seen hurrying from the far side of the square. Odrade recognized Tsimpay, Pondrille’s leader, in the van.\nMother Superior’s attendants moved onto the blue tiles of the fountain plaza—all except Streggi, who stood at Odrade’s shoulder. Tamalane’s group, too, was attracted to splashing water. All part and parcel of a human dream so ancient it could never be completely discarded, Odrade thought.\nFertile fields and open water—clear, potable water you can dip your face into for thirst-quenching relief.\nIndeed, some of her party were doing just that at the fountain. Their faces glistened with dampness.\nThe Pondrille delegation came to a stop near Odrade while still on the blue tiles of the fountain plaza. Tsimpay had brought three other Reverend Mothers and five older acolytes.\nNear the Agony, all of those acolytes, Odrade observed. Showing their awareness of the trial in directness of gaze.\nTsimpay was someone Odrade saw infrequently at Central where she came sometimes as a teacher. She was looking fit: brown hair so dark it appeared reddish-black in this light. The narrow face was almost bleak in its austerity. Her features centered on all-blue eyes under heavy brows.\n“We are glad to see you, Mother Superior.” Sounded as though she meant it.\nOdrade inclined her head, a minimal gesture. / hear you. Why are you so glad to see me?\nTsimpay understood. She gestured to a tall, hollow- cheeked Reverend Mother beside her. “You remember Fali, our Orchard Mistress? Fali has just been to me witha delegation of gardeners. A serious complaint.”\nFali’s weathered face looked a bit gray. Overworked? She had a thin mouth above a sharp chin. Dirt under her fingernails. Odrade noted it with approval. Not afraid to join in the grubbing.\nDelegation of gardeners. So there was an escalation of complaints. Must have been serious. Not like Tsimpay to dump it on Mother Superior.\n“Let’s hear it,” Odrade said.\nWith a glance at Tsimpay, Fali went through a detailed recital, even providing qualifications of delegation leaders. All of them good people, of course.\nOdrade recognized the pattern. There had been conferences concerning this inevitable consequence. Tsimpay in attendance at some of them. How could you explain to your people that a distant sandworm (perhaps not even in existence yet) required this change? How could you explain to farmers that it was nota matter of “just a bit more rain” but went straight to the heart of the planet’s total weather. More rain here could mean a diversion of high-altitude winds. That in its turn would change things elsewhere, cause moisture-laden siroccos where they would\nbe not only upsetting but also dangerous. Too easy to bring on great tornadoes if you inserted the wrong conditions. A planet’s weather was no simple thing to treat with easy adjustments. As / have sometimes demanded. Each time, there was a total equation to be scanned.\n“The planet casts the final vote,” Odrade said. It was an old reminder in the Sisterhood of human fallibility.\n“Does Dune still have a vote?” Fali asked. More bitterness in the question than Odrade had anticipated.\n“| feel the heat. We saw the leaves on your orchards as we arrived,” Odrade said. / know what concerns you, Sister.\n“We will lose part of the crop this year,” Fali said. Accusation in her words: This is your fault!\n“What did you tell your delegation?” Odrade asked.\n“That the desert must grow and Weather no longer can make every adjustment we need.”\nTruth. The agreed response. Inadequate, as truth often was, but all they had now. Something would have to give soon. Meanwhile, more delegations and loss of crops.\n“Will you take tea with us, Mother Superior?” Tsimpay, the diplomat, intervening. You see how it is escalating, Mother Superior? Fali will now go back to dealing with fruits and vegetables. Her proper place. Message delivered.\nStreggi cleared her throat.\nThat damnable gesture will have to be suppressed! But the meaning was clear. Streggi had been put in charge of their schedule. We must be going.\n“We got a late start,” Odrade said. “We stopped only to stretch our legs and see if you have problems you cannot meet on your own.”\n“We can handle the gardeners, Mother Superior.”\nTsimpay’s brisk tone said much more and Odrade almost smiled.\nInspect if you wish, Mother Superior. Look anywhere. You will find Pondrille in Bene Gesserit order.\nOdrade glanced at Tamalane’s bus. Some of the people already were returning to the air-conditioned interior. Tamalane stood by the door, well within earshot.\n“| hear good reports of you, Tsimpay,” Odrade said. “You can do without our interference. | certainly don’t want to intrude on you with an entourage that is far too large", " her throat.\nThat damnable gesture will have to be suppressed! But the meaning was clear. Streggi had been put in charge of their schedule.

Tamalane stood by the door, well within earshot.\n“| hear good reports of you, Tsimpay,” Odrade said. “You can do without our interference. | certainly don’t want to intrude on you with an entourage that is far too large.” This last loud enough that all would be certain to hear.\n“Where will you spend the night, Mother Superior?”\n“Eldio.”\n“I’ve not been down there for some time but | hear the sea is much smaller.”\n“Overflights confirm what you’ve heard. No need to warn them that we’re coming, Tsimpay. They already know. We had to prepare them for this invasion.”\nOrchard Mistress Fali took a small step forward. “Mother Superior, if we could get just...”\n“Tell your gardeners, Fali, that they have a choice. They can grumble and wait here until Honored Matres arrive to enslave them or they can elect to go Scattering.”\nOdrade returned to her car and sat, eyes closed, until she heard the doors sealed and they were well on their way. Presently, she opened her eyes. They already were out of Pondrille and onto the glassy lane through the southern ring orchards. There was charged silence behind her. Sisters were looking deeply into questions about Mother Superior’s behavior back there. An unsatisfactory encounter. Acolytes naturally picked up the mood. Streggi looked glum.\nThis weather demanded notice. Words no longer could smooth over the complaints. Good days were measured by lower standards. Everyone knew the reason but changes remained a focal point. Visible. You could not complain about Mother Superior (not without good cause!) but you could grumble about the weather.\n“Why did they have to make it so cold today? Why today when I have to be out in it? Quite warm when we came out but look at it now. And me without proper clothing!”\nStreggi wanted to talk. Well, that’s why I brought her. But she had become almost garrulous as enforced intimacy eroded her awe of Mother Superior.\n“Mother Superior, I’ve been searching in my manuals for an explanation of—”\n“Beware of manuals!” How many times in her life had she heard or spoken those words? “Manuals create habits.”\nStreggi had been lectured often about habits. The Bene Gesserit had them—those things the Folk preserved as “Typical of the Witches!” But patterns that allowed others to predict behavior, those must be carefully excised.\n“Then why do we have manuals, Mother Superior?”\n“We have them mainly to disprove them. The Coda is for novices and others in primary training.”\n“And the histories?”\n“Never ignore the banality of recorded histories. As a Reverend Mother, you will relearn history in each new moment.”\n“Truth is an empty cup.” Very proud of her remembered aphorism.\nOdrade almost smiled.\nStreggi is a jewel.\nIt was a cautioning thought. Some precious stones could be identified by their impurities. Experts mapped impurities within the stones. A secret fingerprint. People were like that. You often knew them by their defects. The glittering surface told you too little. Good identification required you to look deep inside and see the impurities. There was the gem quality of a total being. What would Van Gogh have been without impurities?\n“It is comments of perceptive cynics, Streggi, things they say about history, that should be your guides before the Agony. Afterward, you will be your own cynic and you will discover your own values. For now, the histories reveal dates and tell you something occurred. Reverend Mothers\nsearch out the somethings and learn the prejudices of historians.”\n“That’s all?” Deeply offended. Why did they waste my time that way?\n“Many histories are largely worthless because prejudiced, written to please one powerful group or another. Wait for your eyes to be opened, my dear. We are the best historians. We were there.”\n“And my viewpoint will change daily?” Very introspective.\n“That’s a lesson the Bashar reminded us to keep fresh in our minds. The past must be reinterpreted by the present.”\n“I’m not sure | will enjoy that, Mother Superior. So many moral decisions.”\nAhhhh, this jewel saw to the heart of it and spoke her mind like a true Bene Gesserit. There were brilliant facets among Streggi’s impurities.\nOdrade looked sideways at the pensive acolyte. Long ago, the Sisterhood had ruled that each Sister must make her own moral decisions. Never follow a leader without asking your own questions. That was why moral conditioning of the young took such high priority.\nThat is why we like to get our prospective Sisters so young. And it may be why a moral flaw has crept into Sheeana. We got her too late. What do she and Duncan talk about so secretly with their hands?\n“Moral decisions are always easy to recognize,” Odrade said. “They are where you abandon self-interest.”\nStreggi looked at Odrade with awe. “The courage it must take!”\n“Not courage! Not even desperation. What we do is, in its most basic sense, natural. Things done because there is no other choice.”\n“Sometimes you make me feel ignorant, Mother Superior.”\n“Excellent! That’s beginning wisdom. There are many kinds of ignorance, Streggi. The basest is to follow your own\ndesires without examining them. Sometimes, we do it unconsciously. Hone your sensitivity. Be aware of what you do unconsciously. Always ask: ‘When | did that, what was | trying to gain?’”\nThey crested the final hill before Eldio and Odrade welcomed a reflexive moment.\nSomeone behind her murmured, “There’s the sea.”\n“Stop here,” Odrade ordered as they neared a wide turnout at a curve overlooking the sea. Clairby knew the place and was prepared for it. Odrade often asked him to stop here. He brought them to a halt where she wanted. The car creaked as it settled. They heard the bus pull up behind, a loud voice back there calling on companions to “Look at that!”\nEldio lay off to Odrade’s left far down there: delicate buildings, some raised off the ground on slender pipes, wind passing under and through them. This was far enough south and down off the heights where Central perched that it was much warmer. Small vertical-axis windmills, toys from this distance, whirled at the corners of Eldio’s buildings to help power the community. Odrade pointed them out to Streggi.\n“We thought of them as independence from bondage to a complex technology controlled by others.”\nAs she spoke, Odrade shifted her attention to the right. The sea! It was a dreadfully condensed remnant of its once glorious expanse. Sea Child hated what she saw.\nWarm vapor lifted from the sea. The dim purple of dry hills drew a blurred outline of horizon on the far side of the water. She saw that Weather had introduced a wind to disperse saturated air. The result was a choppy froth of waves beating against the shingle below this vantage.\nThere had been a string of fishing villages here, Odrade recalled. Now that the sea had receded, villages lay farther back up the slope. Once, the villages had been a colorful accent along the shore. Much of their population had been\nsiphoned off in the new Scattering. People who remained had built a tram to get their boats to and from the water.\nShe approved of this and deplored it. Energy conservation. The whole situation struck her suddenly as grim—like one of those Old Empire geriatric installations where people waited around to die.\nHow long until these places die?\n“The sea is So small!” It was a voice from the rear of the car. Odrade recognized it. An Archives clerk. One of Bell’s damned spies.\nLeaning forward, Odrade tapped Clairby on the shoulder. “Take us down to the near shore, that cove almost directly below us. | wish to swim in our sea, Clairby, while it still exists.”\nStreggi and two other acolytes joined her in the warm waters of the cove. The others walked along the shore or watched this odd scene from the car and bus.\nMother Superior swimming nude in the sea!\nOdrade felt energizing water around her. Swimming was required because of command decisions she must make.\nHow much of this last great sea could they afford to maintain during these final days of their planet’s temperate life? The desert was coming—total/ desert to match that of lost Dune. /f the axe-bearer gives us time. The threat felt very close and the chasm deep. Damn this wild talent! Why do I have to know?\nSlowly, Sea Child and wave motions restored her sense of balance. This body of water was a major complication— much more important than scattered small seas and lakes. Moisture lifted from here in significant amounts. Energy to charge unwanted deviations in Weather’s barely controlled management. Yet, this sea still fed Chapterhouse. It was a communication and transport route. Sea carriers were cheapest. Energy costs must be balanced against other elements in her decision. But the sea would vanish. That was sure. Whole populations faced new displacements.\nSea Child’s memories interfered. Nostalgia. It blocked paths of proper judgment. How fast must the sea go? That was the question. All of the inevitable relocations and resettlements waited on that decision.\nBest it were done quickly. The pain banished into our past. Let us get on with it!\nShe swam to the shallows and looked up at the puzzled Tamalane. Tam’s robed skirts were dark with splashings from an unexpected wave. Odrade lifted her head clear of the Small surges.\n“Tam! Eliminate the sea as fast as possible. Get Weather to plot a swift dehydration scheme. Food and Transport will have to be brought into it. l'Il approve the final plan after our uSual review.”\nTamalane turned away without speaking. She beckoned appropriate Sisters to accompany her, glancing only once at Mother Superior as she did this. See! / was right to bring along the necessary cadre!\nOdrade climbed from the water. Wet sand gritted under her feet. Soon, it will be dry sand. She dressed without bothering to towel herself. Clothing gripped her flesh uncomfortably, but she ignored this, walking up the strand away from the others, not looking back at the sea.\nSouvenirs of memory must be only that. Things to be taken up and fondled occasionally for evocation of past joys. No joy can be permanent. All is transient. “This, too, shall pass away” applies to all of our living universe.\nWhere the beach became loamy dirt and a few sparse plants, she turned finally and looked back at the sea she had just condemned.\nOnly life itself mattered, she told herself. And life could not endure without an ongoing thrust of procreation.\nSurvival. Our children must survive. The Bene Gesserit must survive!\nNo single child was more important than the totality.", " / was right to bring along the necessary cadre!\nOdrade climbed from the water.

She accepted this, recognizing it as the species talking to her\nfrom her deepest self, the self she had first encountered as Sea Child.\nOdrade allowed Sea Child one last sniff of salt air as they returned to their vehicles and prepared to drive into Eldio. She felt herself grow calm. That essential balance, once learned, did not require a sea to maintain it.\nUproot your questions from their ground and the dangling roots will be seen. More questions!\n— MENTAT ZENSUFI\nD ama was in her element.\nSpider Queen!\nShe liked the witches’ title for her. This was the heart of her web, this new control center on Junction. The exterior of the building still did not suit her. Too much Guild complacency in its design. Conservative. But the interior had begun to take on a familiarity that soothed her. She could almost imagine she had never left Dur, that there had been no Futars and the harrowing flight back into the Old Empire.\nShe stood in the open door of the Assembly Room looking out at the Botanical Garden. Logno waited four paces behind. Not too close behind me, Logno, or I shall have to kill you.\nThere was still dew on the lawn beyond the tiles where, when the sun had risen far enough, servants would distribute comfortable chairs and tables. She had ordered a sunny day and Weather had damned well better produce it. Logno’s report was interesting. So the old witch had returned to Buzzell. And she was angry, too. Excellent. Obviously, she knew she was being watched and she had visited her supreme witch to ask for removal from Buzzell, for sanctuary. And she had been refused.\nThey don’t care that we destroy their limbs just as long as the central body remains hidden.\nSpeaking over her shoulder to Logno, Dama said: “Bring that old witch to me. And all of her attendants.”\nAs Logno turned to obey, Dama added: “And begin starving some Futars. | want them hungry.”\n“Yes, Dama.”\nSomeone else moved into Logno’s attendant position. Dama did not turn to identify the replacement. There were always enough aides to carry out necessary orders. One was much like another except in the matter of threat. Logno was a constant threat. Keeps me alert.\nDama inhaled deeply of the fresh air. It was going to be a good day precisely because that was what she desired. She gathered in her secret memories then and let them soothe her.\nGuldur be blessed! We’ve found the place to rebuild our strength.\nConsolidation of the Old Empire was proceeding as planned. There would not be many witches’ nests left out there and, once that damnable Chapterhouse was found, the limbs could be destroyed at leisure.\nIx, now. There was a problem. Perhaps I should not have killed those two Ixian scientists yesterday.\nBut the fools had dared demand “more information” from her. Demanded! And after saying they still had no solution to rearming The Weapon. Of course, they did not know it was a weapon. Did they? She could not be sure. So it had been a good thing to kill those two after all. Teach them a lesson.\nBring us answers, not questions.\nShe liked the order she and her Sisters were creating in the Old Empire. There had been too much wandering about and too many different cultures, too many unstable religions.\nWorship of Guldur will serve them as it serves us.\nShe felt no mystical affinity to her religion. It was a useful tool of power. The roots were well known: Leto II, the one\nthose witches called “The Tyrant,” and his father, Muad’Dib. Consummate power brokers, both of them. Lots of schismatic cells around but those could be weeded out. Keep the essence. It was a well-lubricated machine.\nThe tyranny of the minority cloaked in the mask of the majority.\nThat was what the witch Lucilla had recognized. No way to let her live after discovering she knew how to manipulate the masses. The witch nests would have to be found and burned. Lucilla’s perceptiveness clearly was not an isolated example. Her actions betrayed the workings of a school. They taught this thing! Fools! You had to manage reality or things really got out of control.\nLogno returned. Dama could always tell the sound of her footsteps. Furtive.\n“The old witch will be brought from Buzzell,” Logno said. “And her attendants.”\n“Don’t forget about the Futars.”\n“I have given the orders, Dama.”\nOily voice! You'd like to feed me to the herd, wouldn't you, Logno?\n“And tighten up security on the cages, Logno. Three more of them escaped last night. They were wandering around in the garden when | awoke.”\n“I was told, Dama. More cage guards have been assigned.”\n“And don’t tell me they’re harmless without a Handler.”\n“I do not believe that, Dama.”\nAnd that’s truth from her, for once. Futars terrify her. Good.\n“| believe we have our power base, Logno.” Dama turned, noting that Logno had encroached at least two millimeters into the danger zone. Logno saw it, too, and retreated. As close as you want in front where I can see you, Logno, but not behind my back.\nLogno saw the orange blaze in Dama’s eyes and almost knelt. Definite bending of the knees. “It is my eagerness to serve you, Dama!”\nYour eagerness to replace me, Logno.\n“What of that woman from Gammu? Odd name. What was it?”\n“Rebecca, Dama. She and some of her companions have... ahhh, temporarily eluded us. We will find them. They cannot get off the planet.”\n“You think | should have kept her here, don’t you?”\n“It was wise to think of her as bait, Dama!”\n“She’s still bait. That witch we found on Gammu did not go to those people by accident.”\n“Yes, Dama.”\nYes, Dama! But the subservient sound in Logno’s voice was enjoyable. “Well, get on with it!”\nLogno scurried away.\nThere were always those little cells of potential violence meeting secretly somewhere. Building up their mutual charges of hate, swarming out to disrupt the orderly lives around them. Someone always had to clean up after those disruptions. Dama sighed. Terror tactics were so... SO temporary!\nSuccess, that was the danger. It had cost them an empire. If you waved your success around like a banner someone always wanted to cut you down. Envy!\nWe will hold our success more cautiously this time.\nShe fell into a semi-reverie, still alert to the sounds behind her, but relishing the evidence of new victories that had been displayed to her this morning. She liked to roll the names of captive planets silently on her tongue.\nWallach, Kronin, Reenol, Ecaz, Bela Tegeuse, Gammu, Gamont, Niushe...\nHumans are born with a susceptibility to that most persistent and debilitating disease of intellect: self-deception. The best of all possible worlds and the worst get their dramatic coloration from it. As nearly as we can determine, there is no natural immunity. Constant alertness is required.\n—THE CODA\nW ith Odrade away from Central (and probably only for a short time) Bellonda knew swift action was required. That damned Mentat-ghola is too dangerous to live!\nMother Superior’s party was barely out of sight into the lowering afternoon before Bellonda was on her way to the no-ship.\nNot for Bellonda a thoughtful approach through ring orchards. She ordered space on a tube, windowless, automatic, and fast. Odrade, too, had observers who might send unwanted messages.\nEn route, Bellonda reviewed her assessment of Idaho’s many lives. A record she had kept in Archives ready for quick retrieval. In the original and early gholas, his character had been dominated by impulsiveness. Quick to hate, quick to give loyalty. Later Idaho-gholas tempered this with cynicism but the underlying impulsiveness remained. The Tyrant had called it to action many times. Bellonda recognized a pattern.\nHe can be goaded by pride.\nHis long service to the Tyrant fascinated her. Not only had he been a Mentat several times but there was evidence he had been a Truthsayer in more than one incarnation.\nIdaho’s appearance reflected what she saw in her records. Interesting character lines, a look around the eyes\nand a set to his mouth that went with complex inner development.\nWhy would Odrade not accept the danger of this man? Bellonda had felt frequent misgivings when Odrade spoke of Idaho with such flaunting of her emotions.\n“He thinks clearly and directly. There’s a fastidious cleanliness about his mind. It’s restorative. | like him and | know that’s a trivial thing to influence my decisions.”\nShe admits his influence!\nBellonda found Idaho alone and seated at his console. His attention was fixed on a linear display she recognized: the no-ship’s operational schematics. He washed the projection when he saw her.\n“Hello, Bell. Been expecting you.”\nHe touched his console field and a door opened behind him. Young Teg entered and took up a position near Idaho, staring silently at Bellonda.\nIdaho did not invite her to sit or find a chair for her, forcing her to bring one from his sleeping chamber and place it facing him. When she was seated, he turned a look of wary amusement to her.\nBellonda remained taken aback by his greeting. Why did he expect me?\nHe answered her unspoken question. “Dar projected earlier, told me she was off to see Sheeana. | knew you'd waste no time getting to me when she was gone.”\nSimple Mentat Projection or... “She warned you!”\n“Wrong.”\n“What secrets do you and Sheeana share?” Demanding.\n“She uses me the way you want her to use me.”\n“The Missionaria!”\n“Bell! Two Mentats together. Must we play these stupid games?”\nBellonda took a deep breath and sought Mentat mode. Not easy under these circumstances, that child staring at her, the amusement on Idaho’s face. Was Odrade displaying\nan unsuspected slyness? Working against a Sister with this ghola?\nIdaho relaxed when he saw Bene Gesserit intensity become that doubled focus of the Mentat. “I’ve known for a long time that you want me dead, Bell.”\nYes ... | have been readable in my fears.\nIt had been very close there, he thought. Bellonda had come to him with death in mind, a little drama to create “the necessity” all prepared. He entertained few illusions about his ability to match her in violence. But Bellonda- Mentat would observe before acting.\n“It"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_cf246bb2c1a1311bc05717b7f708ea79b30ea437428d3a30dbc04db23b3f1022_v2"}
