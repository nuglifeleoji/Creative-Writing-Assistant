\n　　“一个人？” \n　　“嗯。” \n　　“为什么？” \n　　田福军的心一沉。他从侄女那张忧郁而憔悴的脸上，似乎看出了一些不幸的迹象，便皱起了眉头。 \n　　润叶突然脸扭到一边，嘴一咧，哭了。 \n　　她一边哭，一边哽咽着对二爸说：“你给我在外地找个工作！我不愿意在原西呆了……” \n　　“为什么？”田福军从椅子里站起来，又一次问侄女。“我不情愿和李向前……”润叶哭着说。 \n　　田福军从办公桌后面转出来，走到侄女面前，弯下腰亲切地对她说：“润叶，你从小就是个明白娃娃，你给二爸说，倒究发生了什么事？你和向前不是两个人情愿才结婚的吗？现在怎么成了这样？你快给二爸说说！” \n　　润叶用手摸了摸脸上的泪水，说：“我原来心里就不情愿！” \n　　“如果是这样，那你为什么要结婚哩？” \n　　“因为我徐大爷说……” \n　　“他说啥了？” \n　　润叶犹豫了半天，才吞吞吐吐把徐国强当初劝她和向前结婚的那些话，都给二爸叙说了。 \n　　“老糊涂虫！” \n　　田福军听完侄女的叙说，气愤地骂了一声老丈人。 \n　　田福军万万没有想到，爱云她爸不只是在他家的院子里种些杂七杂八的庄稼，而且还干这样一种荒唐和愚蠢的事。这等于把他的侄女和李向前都毁了。 \n　　由于前几天乡下所看到的不幸，他未来心情已经很沉重。 \n　　现在又加上侄女的不幸，使他的心情坏到了极点。 \n　　他垂着两条胳膊，痛苦地在脚地上走来走去，胸口感到隐隐作疼。 \n　　这时候，润叶用手绢揩去脸上的泪水，不哭了。她对二爸说：“你也不要过分为我的事熬煎，二爸。反正现在生米做成了熟饭，没办法了。我也不离婚；我担不起这名声。再说，要是我离婚了，家里两个老人当下就能急死。我现在就这样凑合着。要是以后有机会，你把我调到外地去工作；我实在不想在原西呆下去了……二爸，你从小关心我，把我培养大，我会永远记住你的恩情的……” \n　　田福军一只手按在自己的额头上，一边听侄女说话，一边焦虑地思索着他该如何对待这件事。事情相当复杂。他眼下一筹莫展。他不能一下子就率直地建议侄女离婚——本来这是最合适也是最合理的。不能。归根结底，主意还要润叶本人拿。唉，他只能象一个悲观的哲学家一样想：也许只有时间才能解决\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
