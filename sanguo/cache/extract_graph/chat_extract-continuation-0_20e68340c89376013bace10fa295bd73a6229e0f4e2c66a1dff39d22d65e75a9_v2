玄德大喜，请入后堂高坐，拜问曰：“备自别仙颜，因军务倥偬，有失拜访。今得光降，大慰仰慕之私。”徽曰：“闻徐元直在此，特来一会。”玄德曰：“近因曹操囚其母，似母遣人驰书，唤回许昌去矣。”徽曰：“此中曹操之计矣！吾素闻徐母最贤，虽为操所囚，必不肯驰书召其子；此书必诈也。元直不去，其母尚存；今若去，母必死矣！”玄德惊问其故，徽曰：“徐母高义，必羞见其子也。”玄德曰：“元直临行，荐南阳诸葛亮，其人若何？”徽笑曰：“元直欲去，自去便了，何又惹他出来呕心血也？”玄德曰：“先生何出此言？”徽曰：“孔明与博陵崔州平、颍川石广元、汝南孟公威与徐元直四人为密友。此四人务于精纯，惟孔明独观其大略。尝抱膝长吟，而指四人曰：“公等仕进可至刺史、郡守。众问孔明之志若何，孔明但笑而不答。每常自比管仲、乐毅，其才不可量也。”玄德曰：“何颍川之多贤乎！”徽曰：“昔有殷馗善观天文，尝谓群星聚于颍分，其地必多贤士。”时云长在侧曰：“某闻管仲、乐毅乃春秋、战国名人，功盖寰宇；孔明自比此二人，毋乃太过？”徽笑曰：“以吾观之，不当比此二人；我欲另以二人出之。”云长问：“那二人？”徽曰：“可比兴周八百年之姜子牙、旺汉四百年之张子房也。”众皆愕然。徽下阶相辞欲行，玄德留之不住。徽出门仰天大笑曰：“卧龙虽得其主，不得其时，惜哉！”言罢，飘然而去。玄德叹曰：“真隐居贤士也！”\n\n    次日，玄德同关、张并从人等来隆中。遥望山畔数人，荷锄耕于田间，而作歌曰：“苍天如圆盖，陆地似棋局；世人黑白分，往来争荣辱：荣者自安安，辱者定碌碌。南阳有隐居，高眠卧不足！”玄德闻歌，勒马唤农夫问曰：“此歌何人所作？”答曰：“乃卧龙先生所作也。”玄德曰：“卧龙先生住何处？”农夫曰：“自此山之南，一带高冈，乃卧龙冈也。冈前疏林内茅庐中，即诸葛先生高卧之地。”玄德谢之，策马前行。不数里，遥望卧龙冈，果然清景异常。后人有古风一篇，单道卧龙居处。诗曰：“襄阳城西二十里，一带高冈枕流水：高冈屈曲压云根，流水潺潺飞石髓；势若困龙石上蟠，形如单凤松阴里；柴门半掩闭茅庐，中有高人卧不起。修竹交加列翠屏，四时篱落野花馨；床头堆积\n######################\nOutput:",
