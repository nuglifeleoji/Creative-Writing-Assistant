据靖子表示，第一通电话大约是在三个月前打来的。对方没报上名字，一开口就干涉起靖子的私生活。至于内容，全是些惟有平常就观察她才会知道的琐事。是变态跟踪狂――她赫然惊觉，吓坏了。她毫无头绪。后来对方又打来过很多次，她不再接起。不过有一次，她不小心接起，对方那个男人是这么说的：\n    “我知道你忙得没空接电话。我看就这样吧，我每晚都会打电话，如果你有事找我就接电话。我会让电话至少响五声，你只要在那之前接起就行了。”\n    靖子答应了。从此，电话真的每晚响起，对方似乎是从公用电话打来的。她尽量不接那种电话。\n    “声音听不出来是石神吗？”\n    “因为之前几乎都没交谈过，所以我听不出来。在电话中也只有第一次有讲话，现在连那是怎样的声音我都记不清楚了。况且，我怎么也想不到，那个人会做出这种事，他可是个高中老师耶。”\n    “就算是老师，这年头也什么人都有。”岸谷在草S身旁说道，然后就垂下头像要为插嘴道歉似的。\n    草S想起，这个学弟打从命案发生就一直护着花冈靖子。石神的自首，想必令他很安心。\n    “除了电话还有什么特别的吗？”草S问。\n    请等一下，靖子说着站起，从柜子抽屉取出信封，一共三封。没写寄信人是谁，封面上只写着花冈靖子小姐收，也没写地址。\n    “这是？”\n    “就放在我门上的信箱里。本来还有更多封，都被我i了。不过我看电视上说，万一出了什么事，留着这种证物对打官司比较有利，所以虽然很觉得恶心，还是留下了这三封。”\n    “借我看一下。”草S说着打开信封。\n    每个信封都装了一张便签，是以印表机列印出来的文章，内容都不长。\n    “最近，你的妆好像化得比较浓，服装也很花俏。这样不像你，素雅一点的装扮才适合你，还有你的晚归也令人在意。下班之后，就该立刻回家。”\n    “你是否有什么烦恼？如果有，希望毫不保留地告诉我。我就是为了这个才每晚打电话。以我的条件可以提供你很多建议，别的人都无法新人，也不可信任，你只要听我的话就好。”\n    “我有不详的预感，我担心你会背叛我。虽然我相信这决不可能，但如果真有这种事我绝不会原谅你。因为只有我才是你的战友。只有我能够保护你。”\n    草S看完后，把便签又装回信封。\n    “可以先交给我保管吗？”\n    “请便。”\n    “还有什么类似这样的怪事吗？”\n    “我是没遇过……”靖子吞吞吐吐地说。\n    “是令媛遇到什么麻烦吗？”\n    “不，不是的，是工藤先生……”\n    “工藤邦明先生是吧，他怎么了？”\n    “上次见面时，他说他收到奇怪的信。没\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>靖子<|>PERSON<|>靖子 is a person who has
