明自己的力量足够大，那一脚应该可以克敌制胜的，蓝轩宇都已经失去平衡了，一脚踢过去，他被踹飞才正常啊！为什么软倒的又是自己，自己这个天罡龙武魂到底是怎么回事啊？\n\n    可是，那还不是武魂失灵那么简单，似乎自己的身体都失灵了。\n\n    就在这时，同学们的议论声已经传了过来，“班长喜欢蓝轩宇……，故意让他的吧……”\n\n    叶灵瞳只觉得一股悲愤瞬间冲头，她毕竟还只是个才六岁的小姑娘啊！眼泪一下就下来了，立刻大叫道：“我没有，我才没有喜欢他。”\n\n    从地上跳起来，猛的冲到蓝轩宇面前，一把将他推了个趔趄，拔腿就跑。\n\n    “灵瞳！”一班班主任龚英豪叫了一声，见叶灵瞳没有停下的意思，赶忙追了上去。\n\n    秋雨馨的表情则是变得有些古怪起来，看了一眼蓝轩宇，六岁的小孩子能懂什么男女之情，那显然是不可能的。但喜欢这种事儿，可不只是发生于男女之情，也有欣赏的喜欢啊！\n\n    蓝轩宇这长相，绝对可以吸引到任何人的喜欢。难道说，叶灵瞳真的是因为这个对他手下留情？\n\n    蓝轩宇被推了一把，也是莫名其妙，心里哪能不郁闷，对叶灵瞳的印象也更差了几分。不但针对自己，而且脾气还这么差。\n\n    然后他用有些无辜的大眼睛看向秋雨馨，“秋老师，还打吗？”\n\n    秋雨馨瞥了一眼龚英豪离开的背影，再看看自己的得意弟子，嘴角勾勒起一道优美的弧线，“当然要继续，好了，一年级一班，下一个谁来……”\n\n    为了给龚英豪留点面子，也为了让其他同学有锻炼的机会，当蓝轩宇连胜十场的时候，秋雨馨把他给换下来了。至于一班、二班的对抗赛结果……\n\n    而蓝轩宇也终于在学院一战成名。\n\n    如果说第一次战胜叶灵瞳还是侥幸，那第二次呢？更何况，他还连胜其他学员。他那精妙的水元素控制，给老师们都留下了深刻印象，在一年级二班的地位顿时重了许多。\n\n    以至于放学的时候，秋雨馨语重心长的叮嘱他，一定要加强冥想，争取把魂力提升的速度也快一些。\n\n    回到家，蓝轩宇一进门就叫了起来，“娜娜老师、娜娜老师……”\n\n    娜娜推开房门走了出来，看到蓝轩宇，她的眼神自然而然就会柔化，“回来啦。”\n\n    “嗯呢。娜娜老师，你知道吗？今天我们实战课，我可是十连胜呢……”蓝轩宇跑过去，拉着娜娜的手，就把自己今天上课比赛的事情�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
