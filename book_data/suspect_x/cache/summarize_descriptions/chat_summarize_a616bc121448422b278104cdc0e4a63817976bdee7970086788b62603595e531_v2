Initially the widow of Jamis, she later becomes Stilgar's second wife and one of his favored spouses, known for her loyalty and adherence to Fremen traditions. Harah is deeply integrated into the lives of Paul Atreides and his family, serving as a trusted ally and caretaker. She assists Chani during labor, helps raise Paul and Chani's children—including their son Leto and the twins—and participates in key rituals such as the Water Rite and the naming ceremony for the Atreides heirs.  \n\nSkilled in stillsuit maintenance and Fremen customs, Harah prepares coffee in the traditional manner, a role that underscores her cultural knowledge. She is also a close friend of Chani and a guardian of Alia, advocating for her within the sietch while expressing concern over Alia's unconventional behavior. Harah's strong personality is evident in her discussions of tribal politics, succession, and her firm stance on justice, as seen when she speaks about not forgiving and forgetting.  \n\nHer relationship with Paul is one of mutual respect; she is considered trustworthy by him and serves as a member of his household. Harah also interacts with other key figures, such as announcing Princess Irulan's arrival and engaging with Duncan Idaho.
