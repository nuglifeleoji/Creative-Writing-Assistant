I play the hypocrite even with myself.\n“Will there be something on the Fremen?” Paul asked.\n“The Fremen?” Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.\n“Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,” Paul said.\n“Yes, to be sure,” Yueh said. “There are two general separations of the people—Fremen, they are\none group, and the others are the people of the graben, the sink, and the pan. There’s some intermarriage, I’m told. The women of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives. They have a saying: ‘Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.’”\n“Do you have pictures of them?”\n“I'll see what | can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is their eyes—totally blue, no whites in them.”\n“Mutation?”\n“No; it’s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.”\n“The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.”\n“By all accounts,” Yueh said. “They compose poems to their knives. Their women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous. You'll not be permitted to mingle with them, | daresay.”\nPaul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!\n“And the worms?” Paul asked.\n“What?”\n“ld like to study more about the sandworms.”\n“Ah-h-h, to be sure. I’ve a filmbook on a small specimen, only one hundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been recorded by reliable\nwitnesses, and there’s reason to believe even larger ones exist.”\nPaul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen latitudes spread on the table. “The desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?”\n“And the storms.”\n“But any place can be made habitable.”\n“If it’s economically feasible,” Yueh said. “Arrakis has many costly perils.” He smoothed his drooping mustache. “Your father will be here soon. Before | go, I’ve a gift for you, something | came across in packing.” He put an object on the table between them—black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul’s thumb.\nPaul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought: How cautious he is.\n“It’s a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system.” He picked it up, demonstrated. “The book is held closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the edge—thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens.”\n“It’s so small.”\n“But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge—thus, and so...and the charge moves ahead one page ata time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.” He closed the book, handed it to Paul. “Try it.”\nYueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: / salve my own conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may | say to myself that he has gone where | cannot go.\n“This must’ve been made before filmbooks,” Paul Said.\n“It’s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too valuable for one so young.”\nAnd Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.\n“Well....” Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. “If it’s so valuable....”\n“Indulge an old man’s whim,” Yueh said. “It was given to me when | was very young.” And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. “Open it to four-sixty-seven Kalima—where it says: ‘From water does all life begin.’ There’s a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place.”\nPaul felt the cover, detected two notches, one Shallower than the other. He pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier sliding into place.\n“Read it aloud,” Yueh said.\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, read: “‘Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is there around us that we cannot—’”\n“Stop it!” Yueh barked.\nPaul broke off, stared at him.\nYueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna’s favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him.\n“Is something wrong?” Paul asked.\n“I'm sorry,” Yueh said. “That was...my...dead wife’s favorite passage. It’s not the one | intended you to read. It brings up memories that are...painful.”\n“There are two notches,” Paul said.\nOf course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.\n“You may find the book interesting,” Yueh said. “It has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.”\nPaul looked down at the tiny book in his palm— such a small thing. Yet, it contained a mystery... something had happened while he read from it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose.\n“Your father will be here any minute,” Yueh said. “Put the book away and read it at your leisure.”\nPaul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself. He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him, Paul had feared the man would demand the book’s return.\n“I thank you for the gift, Dr. Yueh,” Paul said, speaking formally. “It will be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not hesitate to ask.”\n“l,..need for nothing,” Yueh said.\nAnd he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this poor lad...though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen beasts! Why did they choose me for their abomination?\nHow do we approach the study of Muad’Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?\n—FROM “MUAD’'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.\nThe Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed only by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded his narrow waist.\nThe Duke said: “Hard at work, Son?”\nHe crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze around the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not showing his fatigue. / must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to Arrakis, he thought. There'll be no rest on Arrakis.\n“Not very hard,” Paul said. “Everything’s so....” He shrugged.\n“Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It’ll be good to get settled in our new home, put all this upset behind.”\nPaul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother’s words: “...for the father, nothing.”\n“Father,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?”\nThe Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind—the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The pattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought:\nThis is my son.\n“It’ll be dangerous,” he admitted.\n“Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,” Paul said. And he wondered: Why don’t I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?\nThe Duke noted his son’s distress, said: “As always, Hawat sees the main chance. But there’s much more. | see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles—the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship...a subtle gain.”\n“CHOAM controls the spice,” Paul said.\n“And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,” the Duke said. “There’s more to CHOAM than melange.”\n“Did the Reverend Mother warn you?” Paul blurted. He clenched his fists, feeling his palms\nSlippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask that question.\n“Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,” the Duke said. “Don’t let a woman’s fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your mother’s. Take this as a sign of her love for us.”\n“Does she know about the Fremen?”\n“Yes, and about much more.”\n“What?”\nAnd the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even dangerous facts are valuable if you've been trained to deal with them. And there’s one place where nothing has been spared for my son—dealing with dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.\n“Few products escape the CHOAM touch,” the Duke said. “Logs, donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur—the most prosaic and the most exotic...even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.”\n“And now we control it?”\n“To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product—the spice.\nImagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production.”\n“Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,” Paul said. “Others would be out in the cold.” The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim\nsatisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f5906941010b1116ebb0c70b07d810655e01b01492569ae5e6e7e4c1b7845183_v2"}
