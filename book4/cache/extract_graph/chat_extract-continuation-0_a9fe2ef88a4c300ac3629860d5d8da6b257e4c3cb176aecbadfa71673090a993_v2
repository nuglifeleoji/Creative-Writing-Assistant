他大吃一惊！他发现，镜子里面竟不是他，而是一个陌生的家伙。瞧他的眼角额头全是皱纹，两鬓角有许多白头发！这是他吗？他奇怪地问。 \n　　不是他又是谁！ \n　　王满银那颗愚顽痴蠢的心，就象被利锥猛戳了一下。 \n　　这是我？我老了？脸上有了皱纹？头发上有了白发？他在这镜子面前久久地发呆。 \n　　在这寂静的深夜里，这样呆坐着的时候，他耳边似乎突然传来远方猫蛋和狗蛋喊“爸爸”的声音；他恍惚地看见儿女们戴着红领巾和他们的母亲一块立在罐子村的公路边上，在等待着他回来…… \n　　他看见镜子里的那个家伙嘴咧了几咧。 \n　　这个逛鬼不由伏在桌子上哭开了，鼻涕涎水泪珠子搅混着糊了一脸…… \n　　王满银似乎从这面破镜子里认识了他是谁，是个什么人，过去曾过着什么样的日子。 \n　　“我得要回去！”他对自己说。 \n　　这个逛鬼猛然间开始想念起了他的孩子，老婆和那个破墙烂院里的家。人啊，真不可思议！ \n　　的确，有时候，往往一个极偶然的因素，就可能会改变一个人的生活。 \n　　王满银得感谢大上海小旅馆里的这面镜子。它不仅照出了他的嘴脸、他的衰老，而且也照出了他前半生荒唐而愚蠢的生活。这是一面《西游记》里的照妖镜，照出了“妖怪”王满银和人的王满银。 \n　　王满银一旦“觉醒”，也没有太多的心理过程。反正他一下子开始对他过去的生活厌倦了，而立刻想回到老婆和孩子们的身边——他甚至都等不得天明了！ \n　　这一夜他无心再睡，他就坐在这张小桌前，尽管脑子很乱，但想的完全是罐子村，老婆，猫蛋，狗蛋……他真奇怪自己不呆在罐子村家里享福，为什么这么多年逛到外面来受罪呢？两个娃娃多亲！听说念书都很能行。老婆也多好！带孩子种地，侍候他好吃好喝；而且他什么时候想和她睡觉都由着他，何必在外面看人家搂抱亲嘴呢？自己的老婆情愿怎亲哩，还不要花钱！ \n　　天一明，王满银便火烧屁股一般急着蹿上了西行的列车。这个一改旧性的人，归心似箭，恨不得马上就回罐子村。 \n　　他下了火车，便跳上汽车。一路上任何新奇事都再不能吸引他了。 \n　　到黄原时，他在东关把那一箱袜子胡乱卖掉，钱全部给老婆和孩子买成衣服，就又蹿上了开往老家的汽车……逛鬼王满银没到年根而\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
