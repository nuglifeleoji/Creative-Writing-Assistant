If the spice goes, what coin do we have to buy our way?”\nSounds of surprise: gasps and startled whispers could be heard spreading across the Great Hall. The Chamber echoed to the sound.\nAlia shrugged. “Superstitious nonsense!”\nAl-Fali lifted his right hand to point at Alia. “I speak to the Mother of Moisture, not to the Coan-Teen!”\nAlia’s hands gripped the arms of her throne, but she remained seated.\nAl-Fali looked at Jessica. “Once it was the land where nothing grew. Now there are plants. They spread like lice upon a wound. There have been clouds and rain along the belt of Dune! Rain, My Lady! Oh, precious mother of Muad’Dib, as sleep is death’s brother, so is rain on the Belt of Dune. It is the death of us all.”\n“We do only what Liet-Kynes and Muad’Dib himself designed for us to do,” Alia protested. “What is all of this superstitious gabble? We revere the words of Liet-Kynes, who told us: ‘I wish to see this entire planet caught up ina net of green plants.’ So it will be.”\n“And what of the worms and the spice?” Jessica asked.\n“There'll always be some desert,” Alia said. “The worms will survive.”\nShe’s lying, Jessica thought. Why does she lie?\n“Help us, Mother of Moisture,” al-Fali pleaded.\nWith an abrupt sensation of double vision, Jessica felt her awareness lurch, propelled by the old Naib’s words. It was the unmistakable adab, the demanding memory which came upon one of itself. It came without qualifications and held her senses immobile while the lesson of the past was impressed upon her awareness. She was caught up in it completely, a fish in the net. Yet she felt the demand of it as a human-most moment, each small part a reminder of creation. Every element of the lesson-memory was real but insubstantial in its constant change, and she knew this was the closest she might ever come to experiencing the prescient dietgrasp which had inflicted itself upon her son.\nAlia lied because she was possessed by one who would destroy the Atreides. She was, in herself, the first destruction. Then al-Fali spoke the truth: the sandworms are doomed unless the course of the ecological transformation is modified.\nIn the pressure of revelation, Jessica saw the people of the audience reduced to slow motion, their roles identified for her. She could pick the ones charged with seeing that she did not leave here alive! And the path through them lay there in her awareness as though outlined in bright light— confusion among them, one of them feinted to stumble into another, whole groups tangled. She saw, also, that she might leave this Great Hall only to fall into other hands. Alia did not care if she created a martyr. No—the thing which possessed her did not care.\nNow, in this frozen time, Jessica chose a way to save the old Naib and send him as messenger. The way through the audience remained indelibly clear. How simple it was! They were buffoons with barricaded eyes, their shoulders held in positions of immovable defense. Each position upon the great floor could be seen as an atrophic collision from which dead flesh might slough away to reveal skeletons. Their bodies, their clothes, and their faces described individual hells—the insucked breast of concealed terrors, the glittering hook of a jewel become substitute armor; the mouths were judgments full of frightened absolutes, cathedral prisms of eyebrows showing lofty and religious sentiments which their loins denied.\nJessica sensed dissolution in the shaping forces loosed upon Arrakis. Al-Fali’s voice had been like a distrans in her soul, awakening a beast from the deepest part of her.\nIn an eyeblink Jessica moved from the adab into the universe of movement, but it was a different universe from the one which had commanded her attention only a second before.\nAlia was starting to speak, but Jessica said: “Silence!” Then: “There are those who fear that | have returned without reservation to the Sisterhood. But since that day in the desert when the Fremen gave the gift of life to me and to my son, | have been Fremen!” And she lapsed into the old tongue which only those in this room who could profit by it\nwould understand: “Onsar akhaka zeliman aw maslumen!” Support your brother in his time of need, whether he be just or unjust!\nHer words had the desired effect, a subtle shifting of positions within the Chamber.\nBut Jessica raged on: “This Ghadhean al-Fali, an honest Fremen, comes here to tell me what others should have revealed to me. Let no one deny this! The ecological transformation has become a tempest out of control!”\nWordless confirmations could be seen throughout the room.\n“And my daughter delights in this!” Jessica said. “Mektub al-mellah! You carve wounds upon my flesh and write there in salt! Why did the Atreides find a home here? Because the Mohalata was natural to us. To the Atreides, government was always a protective partnership: Mohalata, as the Fremen have always known it. Now look at her!” Jessica pointed at Alia. “She laughs alone at night in contemplation of her own evil! Spice production will fall to nothing, or at best a fraction of its former level! And when word of that gets out—”\n“We'll have a corner on the most priceless product in the universe!” Alia shouted.\n“We'll have a corner on hell!” Jessica raged.\nAnd Alia lapsed into the most ancient Chakobsa, the Atreides private language with its difficult glottal stops and clicks: “Now, you know, mother! Did you think a granddaughter of Baron Harkonnen would not appreciate all of the lifetimes you crushed into my awareness before | was even born? When I raged against what you’d done to me, | had only to ask myself what the Baron would’ve done. And he answered! Understand me, Atreides bitch! He answered me!”\nJessica heard the venom and the confirmation of her guess. Abomination! Alia had been overwhelmed within, possessed by that cahueit of evil, the Baron Vladimir\nHarkonnen. The Baron himself spoke from her mouth now, uncaring of what was revealed. He wanted her to see his revenge, wanted her to know that he could not be cast out.\nl'm supposed to remain here helpless in my knowledge, Jessica thought. With the thought, she launched herself onto the path the adab had revealed, shouting: “Fedaykin, follow me!”\nIt turned out there were six Fedaykin in the room, and five of them won through behind her.\nWhen I am weaker than you, | ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, | take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.\n—WORDS OF AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER (ATTRIBUTED BY HARQ AL-ADA TO ONE LOUIS VEUILLOT)\neto leaned out the covert exit from the sietch, saw the\nbight of the cliff towering above his limited view. Late afternoon sunlight cast long shadows in the cliff’s vertical Striations. A skeleton butterfly flew in and out of the shadows, its webbed wings a transparent lacery against the light. How delicate that butterfly was to exist here, he thought.\nDirectly ahead of him lay the apricot orchard, with children working there to gather the fallen fruit. Beyond the orchard was the qanat. He and Ghanima had given the slip to their guards by losing themselves in a sudden crush of incoming workers. It had been a relatively simple matter to worm their way down an air passage to its connection with the steps to the covert exit. Now they had only to mingle themselves with the children, work their way to the qanat and drop into the tunnel. There they could move beside the predator fish which kept sandtrout from encysting the tribe’s irrigation water. No Fremen would yet think of a human risking accidental immersion in water.\nHe stepped out of the protective passages. The cliff stretched away on both sides of him, turned horizontal just by the act of his own movement.\nGhanima moved closely behind him. Both carried small fruit baskets woven of spice-fiber, but each basket carried a\nsealed package: Fremkit, maula pistol, crysknife ... and the new robes sent by Farad’n.\nGhanima followed her brother into the orchard, mingled with the working children. Stillsuit masks concealed every face. They were just two more workers here, but she felt the action drawing her life away from protective boundaries and known ways. What a simple step it was, that step from one danger into another!\nIn their baskets those new garments sent by Farad’n conveyed a purpose well understood by both of them. Ghanima had accented this knowledge by sewing their personal motto, “We Share,” in Chakobsa above the hawk crest at each breast.\nIt would be twilight soon and, beyond the qanat which marked off sietch cultivation, there would come a special quality of evening which few places in the universe could match. It would be that softly lighted desert world with its persistent solitude, its saturated sense that each creature in it was alone in a new universe.\n“We've been seen,” Ghanima whispered, bending to work beside her brother.\n“Guards?”\n“No—others.”\n“Good.”\n“We must move swiftly,” she said.\nLeto acknowledged this by moving away from the cliff through the orchard. He thought with his father’s thoughts: Everything remains mobile in the desert or perishes. Far out on the sand he could see The Attendant’s outcropping, reminder of the need for mobility. The rocks lay static and rigid in their watchful enigma, fading yearly before the onslaught of wind-driven sand. One day The Attendant would be sand.\nAs they neared the qanat they heard music from a high entrance of the sietch. It was an old-style Fremen group— two-holed flutes, tambourines, tympani made on spice-\nplastic drums with skins stretched taut across one end. No one asked what animal on this planet provided that much Skin.\nStilgar will remember what | told him about that cleft in The Attendant, Leto thought. He’// come in the dark when it’s too late—and then he'll know.\nPresently they were at the qanat. They slipped into an open tube, climbed down the inspection ladder to the service ledge. It was dusky, damp, and cold in the qanat and they could hear the predator fish splashing. Any sandtrout trying to steal this water would find its water-softened inner surface attacked by the fish. Humans must be wary of them, too.\n“Careful,” Leto said, moving down the slippery ledge. He fastened his memory to times and places his flesh had never known. Ghanima followed.\nAt the end of the qanat they stripped to their stillsuits and put on the new robes. They left the old Fremen robes behind as they climbed out another inspection tube, wormed their way over a dune and down the far side. There they sat shielded from the sietch, strapped on maula pistols and crysknives, slipped the Fremkit packs onto their shoulders. They no longer could hear the music.\nLeto arose, struck out through the valley between the dunes.\nGhanima fell into step behind him, moving with practiced unrhythmical quiet over the open sand.\nBelow the crest of each dune they bent low and crept across into the hidden lee, there to pause and peer backward seeking pursuit.
