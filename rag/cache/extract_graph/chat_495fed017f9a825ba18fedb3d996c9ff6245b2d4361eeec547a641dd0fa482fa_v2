You might return to suspecting that I’m Abomination. No! Let it happen, Gurney. If you try to force it, you'll only destroy yourself.”\nBut Halleck felt himself overcome by doubts. Jessica had warned him. “They can be very beguiling, these pre-born. They have tricks you’ve never even dreamed.” Halleck shook his head slowly. And Paul! Gods below! Paul alive and in league with this question mark he’d fathered!\nThe Fremen around them could no longer be held back. They pressed between Halleck and Paul, between Leto and Paul, shoving the two to the background. The air was\nshowered with hoarse questions. “Are you Muab’Dib? Are you truly Muad’Dib? Is it true, what he says? Tell us!”\n“You must think of me only as The Preacher,” Paul said, pushing against them. “I cannot be Paul Atreides or Muad’Dib, never again. I’m not Chani’s mate or Emperor.’\nHalleck, fearing what might happen if these frustrated questions found no logical answer, was about to act when Leto moved ahead of him. It was there Halleck first saw an element of the terrible change which had been wrought in Leto. A bull voice roared, “Stand aside!”—and Leto moved forward, thrusting adult Fremen right and left, knocking them down, clubbing them with his hands, wrenching knives from their hands by grasping the blades.\nIn less than a minute those Fremen still standing were pressed back against the walls in silent consternation. Leto stood beside his father. “When Shai-Hulud speaks, you obey,” Leto said.\nAnd when a few of the Fremen had started to argue, Leto had torn a corner of rock from the passage wall beside the room’s exit and crumbled it in his bare hands, smiling all the while.\n“I will tear your sietch down around your faces,” he said.\n“The Desert Demon,” someone whispered.\n“And your qanats,” Leto agreed. “I will rip them apart. We have not been here, do you hear me?”\nHeads shook from side to side in terrified submission.\n“No one here has seen us,” Leto said. “One whisper from you and | will return to drive you into the desert without water.”\nHalleck saw hands being raised in the warding gesture, the sign of the worm.\n“We will go now, my father and I, accompanied by our old friend,” Leto said. “Make our ‘thopter ready.”\nAnd Leto had guided them to Shuloch then, explaining en route that they must move swiftly because “Farad’n will be\nA\nhere on Arrakis very soon. And, as my father has said, then you'll see the real test, Gurney.”\nLooking down from the Shuloch butte, Halleck asked himself once more, as he asked every day: “What test? What does he mean?”\nBut Leto was no longer in Shuloch, and Paul refused to answer.\nChurch and State, scientific reason and faith, the individual and his community, even progress and tradition—all of these can be reconciled in the teachings of Muad’Dib. He taught us that there exist no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men. Anyone can rip aside the veil of Time. You can discover the future in the past or in your own imagination. Doing this, you win back your consciousness in your inner being. You know then that the universe is a coherent whole and you are indivisible from it.\n—THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\nhanima sat far back outside the circle of light from the\nspice lamps and watched this Buer Agarves. She didn’t like his round face and agitated eyebrows, his way of moving his feet when he spoke, as though his words were a hidden music to which he danced.\nHe’s not here to parley with Stil, Ghanima told herself, seeing this confirmed in every word and movement from this man. She moved farther back away from the Council circle.\nEvery sietch had a room such as this one, but the meeting hall of the abandoned djedida struck Ghanima as a cramped place because it was so low. Sixty people from Stilgar’s band plus the nine who'd come with Agarves filled only one end of the hall. Spice-oil lamps reflected against low beams which supported the ceiling. The light cast wavering shadows which danced on the walls, and the pungent smoke filled the place with the smell of cinnamon.\nThe meeting had started at dusk after the moisture prayers and evening meal. It had been going on for more than an hour now, and Ghanima couldn’t fathom the hidden currents in Agarves’s performance. His words appeared\nclear enough, but his motions and eye movements didn’t agree.\nAgarves was speaking now, responding to a question from one of Stilgar’s lieutenants, a niece of Harah’s named Rajia. She was a darkly ascetic young woman whose mouth turned down at the corners, giving her an air of perpetual distrust. Ghanima found the expression satisfying in the circumstances.\n“Certainly | believe Alia will grant a full and complete pardon to all of you,” Agarves said. “I’d not be here with this message otherwise.”\nStilgar intervened as Rajia made to speak once more. “I’m not so much worried about our trusting her as | am about whether she trusts you.” Stilgar’s voice carried growling undertones. He was uncomfortable with this suggestion that he return to his old status.\n“It doesn’t matter whether she trusts me,” Agarves said. “To be candid about it, | don’t believe she does. I’ve been too long searching for you without finding you. But I’ve always felt she didn’t really want you captured. She was—”\n“She was the wife of the man | slew,” Stilgar said. “I grant you that he asked for it. Might just as well’ve fallen on his own knife. But this new attitude smells of—”\nAgarves danced to his feet, anger plain on his face. “She forgives you! How many times must I say it? She had the Priests make a great show of asking divine guidance from—’\n“You've only raised another issue.” It was Irulan, leaning forward past Rajia, blonde head set off against Rajia’s darkness. “She has convinced you, but she may have other plans.”\n“The Priesthood has—”\n“But there are all of these stories,” Irulan said. “That you're more than just a military advisor, that you’re her—”\n“Enough!” Agarves was beside himself with rage. His hand hovered near his knife. Warring emotions moved just below the surface of his skin, twisting his features. “Believe\nA\nwhat you will, but | cannot go on with that woman! She fouls me! She dirties everything she touches! | am used. | am soiled. But | have not lifted my knife against my kin. Now— no more!”\nGhanima, observing this, thought: That, at least, was truth coming out of him.\nSurprisingly, Stilgar broke into laughter. “Ahhhh, cousin,” he said. “Forgive me, but there’s truth in anger.”\n“Then you agree?”\n“I’ve not said that.” He raised a hand as Agarves threatened another outburst. “It’s not for my sake, Buer, but there are these others.” He gestured around him. “They are my responsibility. Let us consider for a moment what reparations Alia offers.”\n“Reparations? There’s no word of reparations. Pardon, but no—”\n“Then what does she offer as surety of her word?”\n“Sietch Tabr and you as Naib, full autonomy as a neutral. She understands now how—”\n“I'll not go back to her entourage or provide her with fighting men,” Stilgar warned. “Is that understood?”\nGhanima could hear Stilgar beginning to weaken and thought: No, Stil! No!\n“No need for that,” Agarves said. “Alia wants only Ghanima returned to her and the carrying out of the betrothal promise which she—”\n“So now it comes out!” Stilgar said, his brows drawing down. “Ghanima’s the price of my pardon. Does she think me—”\n“She thinks you sensible,” Agarves argued, resuming his seat.\nGleefully, Ghanima thought: He won't do it. Save your breath. He won't do it.\nAs she thought this, Ghanima heard a soft rustling behind and to her left. She started to turn, felt powerful hands grab her. A heavy rag reeking of sleep-drugs covered her face\nbefore she could cry out. As consciousness faded, she felt herself being carried toward a door in the hall’s darkest reaches. And she thought: / should have guessed! | should’ve been prepared! But the hands that held her were adult and strong. She could not squirm away from them.\nGhanima’s last sensory impressions were of cold air, a glimpse of stars, and a hooded face which looked down at her, then asked: “She wasn’t injured, was she?”\nThe answer was lost as the stars wheeled and streaked across her gaze, losing themselves in a blaze of light which was the inner core of her selfdom.\nMuad’Dib gave us a particular kind of knowledge about prophetic insight, about the behavior which surrounds such insight and its influence upon events which are seen to be “on line.” (That is, events which are set to occur in a related system which the prophet reveals and interprets.) As has been noted elsewhere, such insight operates as a peculiar trap for the prophet himself. He can become the victim of what he knows—which is a relatively common human failing. The danger is that those who predict real events may overlook the polarizing effect brought about by overindulgence in their own truth. They tend to forget that nothing in a polarized universe can exist without its opposite being present.\n—THE PRESCIENT VISION BY HARQ AL-ADA\nlowing sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring the\nrising sun. The sand was cold in the dune shadows. Leto stood outside the ring of the palmyrie looking into the desert. He smelled dust and the aroma of spiny plants, heard the morning sounds of people and animals. The Fremen maintained no qanat in this place. They had only a bare minimum of hand planting irrigated by the women, who carried water in skin bags. Their windtrap was a fragile thing, easily destroyed by the stormwinds but easily rebuilt. Hardship, the rigors of the spice trade, and adventure were a way of life here. These Fremen still believed heaven was the sound of running water, but they cherished an ancient concept of Freedom which Leto shared.\nFreedom is a lonely state, he thought.\nLeto adjusted the folds of the white robe which covered his living stillsuit. He could feel how the sandtrout membrane had changed him and, as always with this feeling, he was forced to overcome a deep sense of loss. He no longer was completely human. Odd things swam in his blood.
