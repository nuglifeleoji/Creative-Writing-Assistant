We will not weaken him by bringing back his old Commander over him.”\nShe studied him a moment, then: “We have not yet commissioned Burzmali as...”\n“lam well aware of that. My old comrades keep me fully informed of Sisterhood politics. But you and I, Mother Superior, know it’s only a matter of time. Burzmali is the best.”\nShe could only accept this. It was more than a military Mentat’s assessment. It was Teg’s assessment. Another thought struck her.\n“Then you already knew about our dispute in Council!” she accused. “And you letme...”\n“Mother Superior, if | thought you would produce another monster on Rakis, | would have said so. You trust my decisions; | trust yours.”\n“Damn you, Miles, we’ve been apart too long.” Taraza stood. “I feel calmer just Knowing you'll be back in harness.”\n“Harness,” he said. “Yes. Reinstate me as a Bashar on special assignment. That way, when word gets back to Burzmali, there’ll be no silly questions.”\nTaraza produced a sheaf of ridulian papers from beneath her robe and passed them to Teg. “I’ve already signed these. Fill in your own reinstatement. The other authorizations are all there, transport vouchers and so on. | give you these orders personally. You are to obey me. You are my Bashar, do you understand?”\n“Wasn't | always?” he asked.\n“It’s more important than ever now. Keep that ghola safe and train him well. He’s your responsibility. And | will back you in that against anyone.”\n“| hear Schwangyu commands on Gammu.”\n“Against anyone, Miles. Don’t trust Schwangyu.”\n“I see. Will you lunch with us? My daughter has...”\n“Forgive me, Miles, but | must get back soonest. | will send Bellonda at once.”\nTeg saw her to the door, exchanged a few pleasantries with his old students in her party and watched as they left. They had an armored groundcar waiting in the drive, one of the new models that they obviously had brought with them. Sight of it gave Teg an uneasy feeling.\nUrgency!\nTaraza had come in person, the Mother Superior herself on a messenger’s errand, knowing what that would reveal to him. Knowing so intimately how the Sisterhood performed, he saw the revelation in what had just happened. The dispute in the Bene Gesserit Council went far deeper than his informants had suggested.\n“You are my Bashar.”\nTeg glanced through the sheaf of authorizations and vouchers Taraza had left with him. Already carrying her seal and signature. The trust this implied added to the other things he sensed and increased his disquiet.\n“Don't trust Schwangyu.”\nHe slipped the papers into his pocket and went in search of Patrin. Patrin would have to be briefed, and mollified. They would have to discuss whom to call in for this assignment. He began to list some of the names in his mind. Dangerous duty ahead. It called for only the best people. Damn! Everything on the estate here would have to be passed over to Firus and Dimela. So many details! He felt his pulse quicken as he strode through the house.\nPassing a house guard, one of his old soldiers, Teg paused: “Martin, cancel all of my appointments for today. Find my daughter and tell her to meet me in my study.”\nWord spread through the house and, from there, across the estate. Servants and family, knowing that The Reverend Mother Superior had just conversed privately with him, automatically set up a protective screen to keep idle distractions away from Teg. His eldest daughter, Dimela, cut him short when he tried to list details necessary to carry on his experimental farm projects.\n“Father, | am not an infant!”\nThey were in the small greenhouse attached to his study. Remains of Teg’s lunch sat on the corner of a potting bench. Patrin’s notebook was propped against the wall behind the luncheon tray.\nTeg looked sharply at his daughter. Dimela favored him in appearance but not in height. Too angular to be a beauty but she had made a good marriage. They had three fine children, Dimela and Firus.\n“Where is Firus?” Teg asked.\n“He’s out seeing to the replanting of the South Farm.”\n“Oh, yes. Patrin mentioned that.”\nTeg smiled. It had always pleased him that Dimela had refused the Sisterhood’s bid, preferring to marry Firus, a native of Lernaeus, and remain in her father’s entourage.\n“All | Know is that they’re calling you back to duty,” Dimela said. “Is it a dangerous assignment?”\n“You know, you sound exactly like your mother,” Teg said.\n“So it is dangerous! Damn them, haven’t you done enough for them?”\n“Apparently not.”\nShe turned away from him as Patrin entered the far end of the greenhouse. He heard her speak to Patrin as they passed.\n“The older he gets the more he gets like a Reverend Mother himself!”\nWhat else could she expect? Teg wondered. The son of a Reverend Mother, fathered by a minor functionary of the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles, he had matured in a household that moved to the Sisterhood’s beat. It had been apparent to him at an early age that his father’s allegiance to CHOAM'’s interplanetary trading network vanished when his mother objected.\nThis house had been his mother’s house until her death less than a year after his father died. The imprint of her choices lay all around him.\nPatrin stopped in front of him. “I came back for my notebook. Have you added any names?”\n“A few. You'd better get right on it.”\n“Yes, sir!” Patrin did a smart about-face and strode back the way he had come, slapping the notebook against his leg.\nHe feels it, too, Teg thought.\nOnce more, Teg glanced around him. This house was still his mother’s place. After all the years he had lived here, raised a family here! Still her place. Oh, he had built this greenhouse, but the study there had been her private room.\nJanet Roxbrough of the Lernaeus Roxbroughs. The furnishings, the decor, still her place. Taraza had seen that. He and his wife had changed some of the surface objects, but the core remained Janet Roxbrough’s. No question about the Fish Speaker blood in that lineage. What a prize she had been for the Sisterhood! That she had wed Loschy Teg and lived out her life here, that was the oddity. An undigestible fact until you knew how the Sisterhood’s breeding designs worked over the generations.\nThey’ve done it again, Teg thought. They’ve had me waiting in the wings all these years just for this moment.\nHas not religion claimed a patent on creation for all of these millennia?\n—THE TLEILAXU QUESTION, FROM MUAD’DIB SPEAKS\nhe air of Tleilax was crystalline, gripped by a stillness\nthat was part the morning chill and part a sense of fearful crouching, as though life waited out there in the city of Bandalong, life anticipating and ravenous, which would not stir until it received his personal signal. The Mahai, Tylwyth Waff, Master of the Masters, enjoyed this hour more than any other of the day. The city was his now as he looked out through his open window. Bandalong would come alive only at his command. This was what he told himself. The fear that he could sense out there was his hold on any reality that might arise from that incubating reservoir of life: the Tleilaxu civilization that had originated here and then spread its powers afar.\nThey had waited millennia for this time, his people. Waff savored the moment now. All through the bad times of the Prophet Leto II (not God Emperor but God’s Messenger), all through the Famines and the Scattering, through every painful defeat at the hands of lesser creatures, through all of those agonies the Tleilaxu had built their patient forces for this moment.\nWe have come to our moment, O Prophet!\nThe city that lay beneath his high window he saw as a symbol, one strong mark on the page of Tleilaxu design. Other Tleilaxu planets, other great cities, interlinked, interdependent, and with central allegiance to his God and his city, awaited the signal that all of them knew must come soon. The twinned forces of Face Dancers and Masheikh had\ncompressed their powers in preparation for the cosmic leap. The millennia of waiting were about to end.\nWaff thought of it as “the long beginning.”\nYes. He nodded to himself as he looked at the crouching city. From its inception, from that infinitesimal kernel of an idea, Bene Tleilax leaders had understood the perils of a plan so extended, so protracted, so convoluted and subtle. They had known they must surmount near disaster time and again, accept galling losses, submissions and humiliations. All of this and much more had gone into the construction of a particular Bene Tleilax image. By those millennia of pretense they had created a myth.\n“The vile, detestable, dirty Tleilaxu! The stupid Tleilaxu! The predictable Tleilaxu! The impetuous Tleilaxu!”\nEven the Prophet’s minions had fallen prey to this myth. A captive Fish Speaker had stood in this very room and shouted at a Tleilaxu Master: “Long pretense creates a reality! You are truly vile!” So they had killed her and the Prophet did nothing.\nHow little all of those alien worlds and peoples understood Tleilaxu restraint. Impetuosity? Let them reconsider after the Bene Tleilax demonstrated how many millennia they were capable of waiting for their ascendancy.\n“Spannungsbogen!”\nWaff rolled the ancient word on his tongue: The span of the bow! How far back you draw the bow before releasing your arrow. This arrow would strike deep!\n“The Masheikh have waited longer than any other,” Waff whispered. He dared to utter the word to himself here in his tower fastness: “Masheikh.”\nThe rooftops below him glittered as the sun lifted. He could hear the stirrings of the city’s life. The sweet bitterness of Tleilaxu smells drifted on the air coming in his window. Waff inhaled deeply and closed his window.\nHe felt renewed by his moment of solitary observation. Turning away from the window, he donned the white khilat\nrobe of honor to which all Domel were conditioned to bow. The robe completely covered his short body, giving him the distinct feeling that it actually was armor.\nThe armor of God!\n“We are the people of the Yaghist,” he had reminded his councillors only last night. “All else is frontier. We have fostered the myth of our weakness and evil practices for these millennia with only one purpose. Even the Bene Gesserit believe!”\nSeated in the deep, windowless sagra with its no- chamber shield, his nine councillors had smiled in silent appreciation of his words. In the judgment of the ghufran, they knew.
