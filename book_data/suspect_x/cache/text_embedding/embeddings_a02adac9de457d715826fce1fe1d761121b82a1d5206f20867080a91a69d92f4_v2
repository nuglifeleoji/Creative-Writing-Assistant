Where is Hwi? What is she doing at this moment?\nThe door from the garden opened without a knock and Teishar, an aide to Garun, entered. Teishar had a dead colored face full of dark wrinkles. His eyes were sunken with\npale yellow around the pupils. Teishar wore a brown robe. He had hair like old grass that had been left out to rot. He seemed unnecessarily ugly, like a dark and elemental spirit. Teishar closed the door and stood there looking at them.\nSiona’s voice came from behind Idaho. “Well, what is it?”\nIdaho noticed then that Teishar seemed strangely excited, vibrating with it.\n“The God Emperor...” Teishar cleared his throat and began again. “The God Emperor will come to Tuono!”\nSiona sat upright on the bed, folding her white robe over her knees. Idaho glanced back at her, then once more to Teishar.\n“He will be wed here, here in Tuono!” Teishar said. “It will be done in the ancient Fremen way! The God Emperor and his bride will be guests of Tuono!”\nFull in the grip of Kanawa, Idaho glared at him, fists clenched. Teishar bobbed his head briefly, turned and let himself out, shutting the door hard.\n“Let me read you something, Duncan,” Siona said.\nIdaho was a moment understanding her words. Fists still clenched at his sides, he turned and looked at her. Siona sat on the edge of her cot, a book in her lap. She took his attention as agreement.\n“Some believe,” she read, “that you must compromise integrity with a certain amount of dirty work before you can put genius to work. They say the compromise begins when you come out of the sanctus intending to realize your ideals. Moneo says my solution is to stay within the sanctus, sending others to do my dirty work.”\nShe looked up at Idaho. “The God Emperor—his own words.”\nSlowly, Idaho relaxed his fists. He knew he needed this distraction. And it interested him that Siona had emerged from her silence.\n“What is that book?” he asked.\nBriefly, she told him how she and her companions had stolen the Citadel charts and the copies of Leto’s journals.\n“Of course you knew about that,” she said. “My father has made it plain that spies betrayed our raid.”\nHe saw the tears latent in her eyes. “Nine of you killed by the wolves?”\nShe nodded.\n“You're a lousy Commander!” he said.\nShe bristled but before she could speak, he asked: “Who translated them for you?”\n“This is from Ix. They say the Guild found the Key.”\n“We already knew our God Emperor indulged in expedience,” Idaho said. “Is that all he has to say?”\n“Read it for yourself.” She rummaged in her pack beside the cot and came up with the first volume of the translation, which she tossed across to his cot. As Idaho returned to the cot, she demanded: “What do you mean I’m a lousy Commander?”\n“Wasting nine of your friends that way.”\n“You fool!” She shook her head. “You obviously never saw those wolves!”\nHe picked up the book and found it heavy, realizing then that it had been printed on crystal paper. “You should have armed yourselves against the wolves,” he said, opening the volume.\n“What arms? Any arms we could get would’ve been useless!”\n“Lasguns?” he asked, turning a page.\n“Touch a lasgun on Arrakis and the Worm knows it!”\nHe turned another page. “Your friends got lasguns eventually.”\n“And look what it got them!”\nIdaho read a line, then: “Poisons were available.”\nShe swallowed convulsively.\nIdaho looked at her. “You did poison the wolves after all, didn’t you?”\nHer voice was almost a whisper: “Yes.”\n“Then why didn’t you do that in advance?” he asked.\n“We... didn’t...know...we... could.”\n“But you didn’t test it,” Idaho said. He turned back to the open volume. “A lousy Commander.”\n“He’s so devious!” Siona said.\nIdaho read a passage in the volume before returning his attention to Siona. “That hardly describes him. Have you read all of this?”\n“Every word! Some of them several times.”\nIdaho looked at the open page and read aloud: “I have created what | intended—a powerful spiritual tension throughout my Empire. Few sense the strength of it. With what energies did | create this condition? | am not that strong. The only power | possess is the control of individual prosperity. That is the sum of all the things | do. Then why do people seek my presence for other reasons? What could lead them to certain death in the futile attempt to reach my presence? Do they want to be saints? Do they think that thus they gain the vision of God?”\n“He’s the ultimate cynic,” Siona said, tears apparent in her voice.\n“How did he test you?” Idaho asked.\n“He showed mea... he showed me his Golden Path.”\n“That’s convenient...”\n“It’s real enough, Duncan.” She looked up at him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “But if it was evera reason for our God Emperor, it is not reason for what he has become!”\nIdaho inhaled deeply, then: “The Atreides come to this!”\n“The Worm must go!” Siona said.\n“| wonder when he’s arriving?” Idaho said.\n“Garun’s little rat friend didn’t say.”\n“We must ask,” Idaho said.\n“We have no weapons,” Siona said.\n“Nayla has a lasgun,” he said. “We have knives... rope. | Saw rope in one of Garun’s storage rooms.”\n“Against the Worm?” she asked. “Even if we could get Nayla’s lasgun, you know it won’t touch him.”\n“But is his cart proof against it?” Idaho asked.\n“| don’t trust Nayla,” Siona said.\n“Doesn't she obey you?”\n“Yes, but...”\n“We will proceed one step at a time,” Idaho said. “Ask Nayla if she would use her lasgun against the Worm’s cart.”\n“And if she refuses?”\n“Kill her.”\nSiona stood, tossing her book aside.\n“How will the Worm come to Tuono?” Idaho asked. “He’s too big and heavy for an ordinary ‘thopter.”\n“Garun will tell us,” she said. “But | think he will come as he usually travels.” She looked up at the ceiling which concealed the Sareer’s perimeter Wall. “I think he will come on peregrination with his entire crew. He will come along the Royal Road and drop down to here on suspensors.” She looked at Idaho. “What of Garun?”\n“A strange man,” Idaho said. “He wants most desperately to be a real Fremen. He knows he is not anything like what they were in my day.”\n“What were they like in your day, Duncan?”\n“They had a saying which describes it,” Idaho said.\n“You should never be in the company of anyone with whom you would not want to die.”\n“Did you say this to Garun?” she asked.\n“Yes.”\n“And his response?”\n“He said I was the only such person he had ever met.”\n“Garun may be wiser than any of us,” she said.\nYou think power may be the most unstable of all human achievements? Then what of the apparent exceptions to this inherent instability? Some families endure. Very powerful religious bureaucracies have been known to endure. Consider the relationship between faith and power. Are they mutually exclusive when each depends upon the other? The Bene Gesserit have been reasonably secure within the loyal walls of faith for thousands of years. But where has their power gone?\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nM oneo spoke in a petulant tone: “Lord, | wish you had given me more time.”\nHe stood outside the Citadel in the short shadows of noon. Leto lay directly in front of him on the Imperial Cart, its bubble hood retracted. He had been touring the environs with Hwi Noree, who occupied a newly installed seat within the bubble cover’s perimeter and just beside Leto’s face. Hwi appeared merely curious about all the bustle which was beginning to increase around them.\nHow calm she is, Moneo thought. He repressed an involuntary shudder at what he had learned of her from Malky. The God Emperor was right. Hwi was exactly what she appeared to be—an ultimately sweet and sensible human being. Would she really have mated with me? Moneo wondered.\nDistractions drew his attention away from her. While Leto had toured Hwi around the Citadel on the suspensor-borne cart, a great troop of courtiers and Fish Speakers had been assembled here, all the courtiers in celebration finery, brilliant reds and golds dominant. The Fish Speakers wore their best dark blues, distinguished only by the different colors in the piping and hawks. A baggage caravan on suspensor sleds had been drawn up at the rear with Fish\nSpeakers to pull it. The air was full of dust and the sounds and smells of excitement. Most of the courtiers had reacted with dismay when told their destination. Some had immediately purchased their own tents and pavilions. These had been sent on ahead with the other impediments piled now on the sand just outside Tuono’s view. The Fish Speakers in the entourage were not taking this in a festive mood. They had complained loudly when told they could not carry lasguns.\n“Just a /ittle more time, Lord,” Moneo was saying. “I still don’t know how we will...”\n“There’s no substitute for time in solving many problems,” Leto said. “However, you can place too much reliance on it. | can accept no more delays.”\n“We will be three days just getting there,” Moneo complained.\nLeto thought about that time—the swift walk-trot-walk of a peregrination ... one hundred and eighty kilometers. Yes, three days.\n“I’m sure you’ve made good arrangements for the way- stops,” Leto said. “Plenty of hot water for the muscle cramps?”\n“We'll be comfortable enough,” Moneo said, “but | don’t like leaving the Citadel in these times! And you know why!”\n“We have communications devices, loyal assistants. The Guild is suitably chastened. Calm yourself, Moneo.”\n“We could hold the ceremony in the Citadel!”\nFor answer, Leto closed the bubble cover around him, isolating Hwi with him.\n“Is there danger, Leto?” she asked.\n“There’s always danger.”\nMoneo sighed, turned and trotted toward where the Royal Road began its long climb eastward before turning south around the Sareer. Leto set his cart in motion behind the majordomo, heard his motley troop fall into step behind them.\n“Are we all moving?” Leto asked.\nHwi glanced backward around him. “Yes.” She turned toward his face. “Why was Moneo being so difficult?”\n“Moneo has discovered that the instant which has just left him is forever beyond his reach.”\n“He has been very moody and distracted since you returned from the Little Citadel. He’s not the same at all.”\n“He is an Atreides, my love, and you were designed to please an Atreides.”\n“It’s not that. | would know if it were that.”\n“Yes... well, | think Moneo has also discovered the reality of death.”\n“What’s it like at the Little Citadel when you’re there with Moneo?” she asked.\n“It’s the loneliest place in my Empire", " its long climb eastward before turning south around the Sareer. Leto set his cart in motion behind the majordomo, heard his motley troop fall into step behind them.\n“Are we all moving?” Leto asked.\nHwi glanced backward around him. “Yes.” She turned toward his face. “Why was Moneo being so difficult?”\n“Moneo has discovered that the instant which has just left him is forever beyond his reach.”\n“He has been very moody and distracted since you returned from the Little Citadel. He’s not the same at all.”\n“He is an Atreides, my love, and you were designed to please an Atreides.”\n“It’s not that. | would know if it were that.”\n“Yes... well, | think Moneo has also discovered the reality of death.”\n“What’s it like at the Little Citadel when you’re there with Moneo?” she asked.\n“It’s the loneliest place in my Empire.”\n“I think you avoid my questions,” she said.\n“No, love. | share your concern for Moneo, but no explanation of mine will help him now. Moneo is trapped. He has learned that it is difficult to live in the present, pointless to live in the future and impossible to live in the past.”\n“I think it’s you who have trapped him, Leto.”\n“But he must free himself.”\n“Why can’t you free him?”\n“Because he thinks my memories are his key to freedom. He thinks | am building our future out of our past.”\n“Isn't that always the way of it, Leto?”\n“No, dear Hwi.”\n“Then how is it?”\n“Most believe that a satisfactory future requires a return to an idealized past, a past which never in fact existed.”\n“And you with all of your memories know otherwise.”\nLeto turned his face within its cowl to stare at her, probing .. . remembering. Out of the multitudes within him, he could form a composite, a genetic suggestion of Hwi, but the suggestion fell far short of the living flesh. That was it, of course. The past became row-on-row of eyes staring\noutward like the eyes of gasping fish, but Hwi was vibrant life. Her mouth was set in Grecian curves designed for a Delphic chant, but she hummed no prophetic syllables. She was content to live, an opening person like a flower perpetually unfolding into fragrant blossom.\n“Why are you looking at me like that?” she asked.\n“I was basking in the love of you.”\n“Love, yes.” She smiled. “I think that since we cannot Share the love of the flesh, we must share the love of the soul. Would you share that with me, Leto?”\nHe was taken aback. “You ask about my soul?”\n“Surely others have asked.”\nHe spoke shortly: “My soul digests its experiences, nothing more.”\n“Have | asked too much of you?” she asked.\n“I think that you cannot ask too much of me.”\n“Then | presume upon our love to disagree with you. My Uncle Malky talked about your soul.”\nHe found that he could not respond. She took his silence as an invitation to continue. “He said that you were the ultimate artist at probing the soul, your own soul first.”\n“But your Uncle Malky denied that he had a soul of his own!”\nShe heard the harshness in his voice, but was not deterred. “Still, | think he was right. You are the genius of the soul, the brilliant one.”\n“You need only the plodding perseverance of duration,” he said. “No brilliance.”\nThey were well onto the long climb to the top of the Sareer’s perimeter Wall now. He lowered his cart’s wheels and deactivated the suspensors.\nHwi spoke softly, her voice barely audible above the grating sound of the cart’s wheels and the running feet all around them. “May | call you Love, anyway?”\nHe spoke around a remembered tightness in a throat which was no longer completely human. “Yes.”\n“I was born an Ixian, Love,” she said. “Why don’t | share their mechanical view of our universe? Do you know my view, Leto my love?”\nHe could only stare at her.\n“| sense the supernatural at every turning,” she said.\nLeto’s voice rasped, sounding angry even to him: “Each person creates his own supernatural.”\n“Don’t be angry with me, Love.”\nAgain, that awful rasping: “It is impossible for me to be angry with you.”\n“But something happened between you and Malky once,” she said. “He would never tell me what it was, but he said he often wondered why you spared him.”\n“Because of what he taught me.”\n“What happened between you two, Love?”\n“|I would rather not talk about Malky.”\n“Please, Love. | feel that it’s important for me to know.”\n“I suggested to Malky that there might be some things men should not invent.”\n“And that’s all?”\n“No.” He spoke reluctantly. “My words angered him. He said: ‘You think that in a world without birds, men would not invent aircraft! What a fool you are! Men can invent anything!’”\n“He called you a fool?” There was shock in Hwi’s voice.\n“He was right. And although he denied it, he spoke the truth. He taught me that there was a reason for running away from inventions.”\n“Then you fear the Ixians?”\n“Of course | do! They can invent catastrophe.”\n“Then what could you do?”\n“Run faster. History is a constant race between invention and catastrophe. Education helps but it’s never enough. You also must run.”\n“You are sharing your soul with me, Love. Do you know that?”\nLeto looked away from her and focused on Moneo’s back, the motions of the majordomo, the tucked-in pretenses of secrecy so apparent there. The procession had come off the first gentle incline. It turned now to begin the climb onto Ringwall West. Moneo moved as he had always moved, one foot ahead of another, aware of the ground where he would place each step, but there was something new in the majordomo. Leto could feel the man drawing away, no longer content to march beside his Lord’s cowled face, no longer trying to match himself to his master’s destiny. Off to the east, the Sareer waited. Off to the west, there was the river, the plantations. Moneo looked neither left nor right. He had seen another destination.\n“You do not answer me,” Hwi said.\n“You already know the answer.”\n“Yes. | am beginning to understand something of you,” she said. “I can sense some of your fears. And | think | already know where it is that you live.”\nHe turned a startled glance on her and found himself locked in her gaze. It was astonishing. He could not move his eyes away from her. A profound fear coursed through and he felt his hands begin to twitch.\n“You live where the fear of being and the love of being are combined, all in one person,” she said.\nHe could not blink.\n“You are a mystic,” she said, “gentle to yourself only because you are in the middle of that universe looking outward, looking in ways that others cannot. You fear to Share this, yet you want to share it more than anything else.”\n“What have you seen?” he whispered.\n“| have no inner eye, no inner voices,” she said. “But | have seen my Lord Leto, whose soul | love, and | know the only thing that you truly understand.”\nHe broke from her gaze, fearful of what she might say. The trembling of his hands could be felt all through his front\nsegment.\n“Love, that is what you understand,” she said. “Love, and that is all of it.”\nHis hands stopped trembling. A tear rolled down each of his cheeks. When the tears touched his cowl, wisps of blue smoke erupted. He sensed the burning and was thankful for the pain.\n“You have faith in life,” Hwi said. “I know that the courage of love can reside only in this faith.”\nShe reached out with her left hand and brushed the tears from his cheeks. It surprised him that the cowl did not react with its ordinary reflex to prevent the touch.\n“Do you know,” he asked, “that since | have become thus, you are the first person to touch my cheeks?”\n“But | Know what you are and what you were,” she said.\n“What I was ... ahhh, Hwi. What I was has become only this face, and all the rest is lost in the shadows of memory... hidden... gone.”\n“Not hidden from me, Love.”\nHe looked directly at her, no longer afraid to lock gazes. “Is it possible that the Ixians know what they have created in you?”\n“| assure you, Leto, love of my soul, that they do not know. You are the first person, the only person to whom | have ever completely revealed myself.”\n“Then | will not mourn for what might have been,” he said. “Yes, my love, | will share my soul with you.”\nThink of it as plastic memory, this force within you which trends you and your fellows toward tribal forms. This plastic memory seeks to return to its ancient shape, the tribal society. It is all around you—the feudatory, the diocese, the corporation, the platoon, the sports club, the dance troupes, the rebel cell, the planning council, the prayer group... each with its master and servants, its host and parasites. And the swarms of alienating devices (including these very words!) tend eventually to be enlisted in the argument for a return to “those better times.” | despair of teaching you other ways. You have square thoughts which resist circles.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho found he could manage the climb without thinking\nabout it. This body grown by the Tleilaxu remembered things the Tleilaxu did not even suspect. His original youth might be lost in the eons, but his muscles were Tleilaxu- young and he could bury his childhood in forgetfulness while he climbed. In that childhood, he had learned survival by flight into the high rocks of his home planet. It did not matter that these rocks in front of him now had been brought here by men, they also had been shaped by ages of weather.\nThe morning sun was hot on Idaho’s back. He could hear Siona’s efforts to reach the relatively simple support position of a narrow ledge far below him. The position was virtually useless to Idaho, but it had been the argument which had brought Siona finally into agreement that they should attempt this climb.\nThey.\nShe had objected that he might try it alone.\nNayla, three of her Fish Speaker aides, Garun and three chosen from his Museum Fremen waited on the sand at the foot of the barrier Wall which enclosed the Sareer.\nIdaho did not think about the Wall’s height. He thought only about where he would next put a hand or a foot. He thought about the coil of light rope around his shoulders. That rope was the ta//ness of this Wall. He had measured it out on the ground, triangulating across the sand, not counting his steps. When the rope was long enough it was long enough. The Wall was as high as the rope was long. Any other way of thinking could only dull his mind.\nFeeling for handholds which he could not see, Idaho groped his way up the sheer face. . . well, not quite sheer.

Wind and sand and even some rain, the forces of cold and heat, had been at their erosive work here for more than three thousand years. For one full day, Idaho had sat on the sand below the Wall and he had studied what had been accomplished by Time. He had fixed certain patterns in his mind—a slanting shadow, a thin line, a crumbling bulge, a tiny lip of rock here and another over there.\nHis fingers wriggled upward into a sharp crack. He tested his weight gently on the support. Yes. Briefly, he rested, pressing his face against warm rock, not looking up or down. He was simply here. Everything was a matter of the pacing. His shoulders must not be allowed to tire too soon. Weight must be adjusted between feet and arms. Fingers took inevitable damage, but while bone and tendons held, the Skin could be ignored.\nOnce more, he crept upward. A bit of rock broke away from his hand; dust and shards fell across his right cheek, but he did not even feel it. Every bit of his awareness concentrated on the groping hand, the balance of his feet on the tiniest of protrusions. He was a mote, a particle which defied gravity .. . a fingerhold here, a toehold there, clinging to the rock surface at times by the sheer power of his will.\nNine makeshift pitons bulged one of his pockets, but he resisted using them. The equally makeshift hammer dangled\nfrom his belt on a short cord whose knot his fingers had memorized.\nNayla had been difficult. She would not give up her lasgun. She had, however, obeyed Siona’s direct order to accompany them. A strange woman .. . strangely obedient.\n“Have you not sworn to obey me?” Siona had demanded.\nNayla’s reluctance had vanished.\nLater, Siona had said: “She always obeys my direct orders.”\n“Then we may not have to kill her,” Idaho had said.\n“I would rather not attempt it. | don’t think you have even the faintest idea of her strength and quickness.”\nGarun, the Museum Fremen who dreamed of becoming a “true Naib in the old fashion,” had set the stage for this climb by answering Idaho’s question: “How will the God Emperor come to Tuono?”\n“In the same way he chose for a visit during my great- grandfather’s time.”\n“And that was?” Siona had prompted him.\nThey had been sitting in the dusty shadows outside the guest house, sheltering from the afternoon sun on the day of the announcement that the Lord Leto would be wed in Tuono. A semicircle of Garun’s aides squatted around the doorstep where Siona and Idaho sat with Garun. Two Fish Speakers lounged nearby, listening. Nayla was due to arrive momentarily.\nGarun pointed to the high Wall behind the village, its rim glistening distant gold in the sunlight. “The Royal Road runs there and the God Emperor has a device which lowers him gently from the heights.”\n“It’s built into his cart,” Idaho said.\n“Suspensors,” Siona agreed. “I’ve seen them.”\n“My great-grandfather said they came along the Royal Road, a great troop of them. The God Emperor glided down to our village square on his device. The others came down on ropes.”\nIdaho spoke thoughtfully: “Ropes.”\n“Why did they come?” Siona asked.\n“To affirm that the God Emperor had not forgotten his Fremen, so my great-grandfather said. It was a great honor, but not as great as this wedding.”\nIdaho arose while Garun was still talking. There was a clear view of the high Wall from nearby—straight down the central street, a view from the base in the sand to the top in the sunlight. Idaho strode to the corner of the guest house out into the central street. He stopped there, turned and looked at the Wall. The first look told why everyone said it was not possible to climb that face. Even then, he resisted thinking about a measurement of the height. It could be five hundred meters or five thousand. The important thing lay in what a more careful study revealed—tiny transverse cracks, broken places, even a narrow ledge about twenty meters above the drifting sand at the bottom... and another ledge about two-thirds of the way up the face.\nHe knew that an unconscious part of him, an ancient and dependable part, was making the necessary measurements, scaling them to his own body—so many Duncan-lengths to that place, a handgrip here, another there. His own hands. He could already feel himself climbing.\nSiona’s voice came from near his right shoulder as he stood in that first examination. “What’re you doing?” She had come up soundlessly, looking now where he looked.\n“I can climb that Wall,” Idaho said. “If | carried a light rope, | could pull up a heavier rope. The rest of you could climb it easily then.”\nGarun joined them in time to hear this. “Why would you climb the Wall, Duncan Idaho?”\nSiona answered for him, smiling at Garun. “To provide a Suitable greeting for the God Emperor.”\nThis had been before her doubts, before her own eyes and the ignorance of such a climb, had begun to erode that first confidence.\nWith that first elation, Idaho asked: “How wide is the Royal Road up there?”\n“| have never seen it,” Garun said. “But | am told it is very wide. A great troop can march abreast along it, so they say. And there are bridges, places to view the river and... and... oh, itis a marvel.”\n“Why have you never gone up there to see it yourself?” Idaho asked.\nGarun merely shrugged and pointed at the Wall.\nNayla arrived then and the argument about the climb had begun. Idaho thought about that argument as he climbed. How strange, the relationship between Nayla and Siona! They were like two conspirators ... yet not conspirators. Siona commanded and Nayla obeyed. But Nayla was a Fish Speaker, the Friend who was trusted by Leto to make a first examination of the new ghola. She admitted that she had been in the Royal Constabulary since childhood. Such strength in her! Given that strength, there was something awesome about the way she bowed to Siona’s will. It was as though Nayla listened for secret voices which told her what to do. Then she obeyed.\nIdaho groped upward for another handhold. His fingers wriggled along the rock, up and outward to the right, finding at last an unseen crack where they might enter. His memory provided the natural line of ascent, but only his body could learn the way by following that line. His left foot found a toehold...up...up... slowly, testing. Left hand up now ...no crack but a ledge. His eyes, then his chin lifted over the high ledge he had seen from below. He elbowed his way onto it, rolled over and rested, looking only outward, not up or down. It was a sand horizon out there, a breeze with dust in it limiting the view. He had seen many such horizons in the Dune days.\nPresently, he turned to face the Wall, lifted himself onto his knees, hands groping upward, and he resumed the climb. The picture of the Wall remained in his mind as he\nhad seen it from below. He had only to close his eyes and the pattern lay there, fixed the way he had learned to do it as a child hiding from Harkonnen slave raiders. Fingertips found a crack where they could be wedged. He clawed his way upward.\nWatching from below, Nayla experienced a growing affinity for the climber. Idaho had been reduced by distance to such a small and lonely shape upon the Wall. He must know what it was like to be alone with momentous decisions.\n| would like to have his child, she thought. A child from both of us would be strong and resourceful. What is it that God wants from a child of Siona and this man?\nNayla had awakened before dawn and had walked out to the top of a low dune at the village edge to think about this thing that Idaho proposed. It had been a lime dawn with a familiar winding cloth of dust in the distance, then steel day and the baleful immensity of the Sareer. She knew then that these matters certainly had been anticipated by God. What could be hidden from God? Nothing could be hidden, not even the remote figure of Duncan Idaho groping for a pathway up to the edge of heaven.\nAs she watched Idaho climb, Nayla’s mind played a trick on her, tipping the wall to the horizontal. Idaho became a child crawling across a broken surface. How small he looked ... and growing smaller.\nAn aide offered Nayla water which she drank. The water brought the Wall back into its true perspective.\nSiona crouched on the first ledge, leaning out to peer upward. “If you fall, | will try it,” Siona had promised Idaho. Nayla had thought it a strange promise. Why would both of them want to try the impossible?\nIdaho had failed to dissuade Siona from the impossible promise.\nIt is fate, Nayla thought. /t is God’s will.\nThey were the same thing.\nA bit of rock fell from where Idaho clutched at it. That had happened several times. Nayla watched the falling rock. It took a long time coming down, bounding and rebounding from the Wall’s face, demonstrating that the eye did not report truthfully when it said the Wall was sheer.\nHe will succeed or he will not, Nayla thought. Whatever happens, it is God’s will.\nShe could feel her heart hammering, though. Idaho’s venture was like sex, she thought. It was not passively erotic, but akin to rare magic in the way it seized her. She had to keep reminding herself that Idaho was not for her.\nHe is for Siona. If he survives.\nAnd if he failed, then Siona would try. Siona would succeed or she would not. Nayla wondered, though, if she might experience an orgasm should Idaho reach the top. He was so close to it now.\nIdaho took several deep breaths after dislodging the rock. It was a bad moment and he took the time to recover, clinging to a three-point hold on the Wall. Almost of its own accord, his free hand groped upward once more, wriggling past the rotten place into another slender crack. Slowly, he shifted his weight onto that hand. Slowly . . . slowly. His left knee felt the place where a toehold could be achieved. He lifted his foot to that place, tested it. Memory told him the top was near, but he pushed the memory aside. There was only the climb and the knowledge that Leto would arrive tomorrow.\nLeto and Hwi.\nHe could not think about that, either. But it would not go away. The top...Hwi...Leto...tomorrow...\nEvery thought fed his desperation, forced him into the immediate remembrance of the climbs of his childhood.
