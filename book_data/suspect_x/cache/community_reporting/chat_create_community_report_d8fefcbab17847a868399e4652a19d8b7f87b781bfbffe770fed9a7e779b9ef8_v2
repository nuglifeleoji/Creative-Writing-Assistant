Trained by the Sisterhood and possessing enhanced abilities—possibly due to a T-probe or other external stimuli—he is renowned for his tactical brilliance, combat skills, and heightened perception. Teg serves as a mentor to Duncan Idaho, training him and aiding in the restoration of his original memories, though he finds the process distasteful. His loyalty to the Bene Gesserit is unwavering, and he carries out critical missions, including protecting Duncan’s ghola and leading operations against threats like the Honored Matres and Tleilaxu.  \n\nTeg’s history is marked by gallant stands, such as his last battle on Gammu, where he was hunted and later captured by the Honored Matres. Despite enduring torture and interrogation, he resists using his Mentat and Bene Gesserit training. His strategic assessments, including critiques of Junction’s defenses, are highly valued. Teg is also linked to the Atreides lineage, sharing a resemblance to Duke Leto and demonstrating moral superiority.  \n\nCurrently, his status varies across accounts: some describe him as missing, others as actively leading missions or being restored as Supreme Bashar. A ghola of Teg exists, undergoing memory recovery under Duncan’s guidance, suggesting the Bashar’s legacy continues. Teg is regarded as a father figure by both Duncan and Odrade, further cementing his importance to the Bene Gesserit’s plans. His multifaceted role—strategist, protector, and symbol of resilience—makes him indispensable to the Sisterhood’s survival.\",102\n1718,YSAI,\"**YSAI** is a major metropolis located on the planet **Gammu** (formerly known as **Giedi Prime**), historically significant as the ancient **Harkonnen seat of Barony**. The city is a hub of activity, characterized by its chaotic and disorganized urban structure, featuring mismatched and ancient buildings that reflect its long and turbulent history. Among its most notable landmarks is a **prominent black rectangle of a building**, which **Teg** associates with the \"\"puppet masters,\"\" suggesting a center of power or control.  \n\nYSAI serves as a critical destination for multiple key figures. **Teg** seeks refuge here, aided by allies despite the city's inherent dangers, and it is where he is located after his attack on the **Honored Matres**. The city also acts as a **Bene Gesserit operational hub**, featuring advanced security systems and safe addresses for their activities. Additionally, **Lucilla** and **Burzmali** travel to YSAI under disguise, entering through its **lower-class quarter**, which boasts an active nightlife.  \n\nThe city's outskirts are marked by **overgrown tracks**, and its chaotic layout extends beyond its urban core. **Duncan Idaho** and **Tormsa** traveled through YSAI before their capture, further emphasizing its role as a crossroads for pivotal events. Functionaries with **datacases** are frequently observed here, reinforcing its status as a center of administrative or clandestine operations.  \n\nDespite some discrepancies in naming (occasionally referred to as **Y'sai** or **Ysai**), the descriptions consistently portray YSAI as a **dangerous yet strategically vital city**—a place of refuge, intrigue, and historical weight, deeply tied to the legacies of the **Harkonnens** and the ongoing struggles of the **Bene Gesserit** and their allies.\",3\n1567,FIRUS,\"**FIRUS** is Dimela's husband and plays a key role in managing Teg's estate. Alongside Patrin, he is also privy to Teg's specific intentions and preferences concerning the South Farm, indicating his involvement in both estate management and decision-making related to Teg's agricultural holdings. This dual role highlights FIRUS's trusted position within Teg's affairs, serving as both a familial support to Dimela and a knowledgeable figure in executing Teg's directives.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively portray FIRUS as a reliable and informed individual, entrusted with responsibilities that span both personal and estate-related matters. There are no contradictions in the provided information; rather, the details complement each other to present a cohesive picture of his roles and relationships.\",2\n1576,JANET ROXBROUGH,\"**JANET ROXBROUGH**  \n\nJanet Roxbrough was the mother of Teg, a prominent figure associated with the Bene Gesserit order. She held the rank of Reverend Mother and belonged to the Lernaeus Roxbroughs, a lineage or group within the Bene Gesserit. Descriptions of her relationship to Teg vary slightly, with one source identifying her as his birth mother and another simply as his mother, but both confirm her Bene Gesserit affiliation and her status as a Reverend Mother. The reference to \"\"Lernaeus\"\" suggests a possible connection to a specific branch or house within the order, though further details about her role or influence remain unspecified.  \n\nIn summary, Janet Roxbrough was a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother from the Lernaeus Roxbroughs and the mother (or birth mother) of Teg, underscoring her significance within the order and her familial ties to a key individual.\",2\n1787,T-PROBE,\"The **T-PROBE** is a sophisticated and torturous device originating from the Scattering, designed to replicate and manipulate a subject's sensory inputs and bodily functions. It has been notably used on the individual **Teg**, both as a tool for interrogation and as a means of inflicting severe physical and psychological torment. During a previous encounter, the T-probe was employed to extract critical information from Teg, demonstrating its effectiveness as an instrument of coercion.  \n\nBeyond its use as an interrogation device, the T-probe also had a transformative effect on Teg, altering his perception and enhancing his innate abilities—particularly his time sense. However, this enhancement came at a great cost, as the device's manipulations severely affected his physical condition and temporal awareness, leaving lasting repercussions.  \n\nWhile the T-probe's primary function appears to be torture and information extraction, its dual nature—as both a destructive and transformative tool—highlights its advanced and insidious design. The device's capacity to simultaneously inflict pain and induce physiological changes makes it a uniquely dangerous instrument within the technological arsenal of the Scattering.\",2\n1617,LERNEAUS,\"**Lernaeus** is the home planet of **Janet Roxbrough**, the birth-mother of **Miles Teg**, and serves as the setting for key moments in his early life. It was the location of the **Teg family's dining room**, where Miles fondly recalls childhood memories of shared meals with his family. Additionally, Lernaeus was the site of his childhood home, where he encountered **Bene Gesserit acolytes**, including **Carlana**, hinting at early influences that may have shaped his later connections to the order. The planet thus holds personal and formative significance in Teg's life, serving as both a familial anchor and a backdrop for his early interactions with the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively paint Lernaeus as a place of warmth, family ties, and subtle political or religious undertones due to the presence of Bene Gesserit members. There are no direct contradictions in the provided details, only complementary layers that enrich the planet's role in Teg's history. The summary integrates all aspects into a coherent narrative, emphasizing Lernaeus as a foundational setting in Miles Teg's upbringing.\",2\n1803,RENDITAI,\"**Renditai** was a minor skirmish in Teg's military history, where he commanded loyal soldiers and fought alongside others who later became his allies. This past battle or event played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of Teg's followers, as many of those who fought with him eventually settled in Ysai. While the conflict itself was relatively small in scale, its aftermath fostered lasting bonds among the participants, reinforcing Teg's leadership and the loyalty of his companions. The event is remembered as a pivotal moment that contributed to the cohesion of Teg's forces and their subsequent presence in Ysai.  \n\nIn summary, Renditai was a brief but consequential engagement in Teg's career, uniting soldiers who would later support him and establish themselves in Ysai. The skirmish underscores the interconnectedness of Teg's military endeavors and the enduring relationships forged through shared combat.\",2\n1807,IXIAN MANUFACTURE,\"Ixian manufacture refers to the high-quality pre-Scattering technology, including the groundcar Teg is riding in.\",2\n1569,LERNAEUS,\"**LERNAEUS** is a planet that serves as the homeworld of **Firus** and the **Roxbroughs**, as well as the location of **Teg's** expansive research garden. As the primary residence of these individuals, Lernaeus holds significance both as a dwelling place and a site of scientific exploration. The planet's environment supports diverse flora, as evidenced by Teg's dedicated garden, which is used for extensive research purposes. While the descriptions do not provide further details about Lernaeus's climate, geography, or societal structure, it is clear that the planet plays a central role in the lives of its inhabitants, functioning as both a home and a hub for botanical study.  \n\nThe coexistence of residential and research facilities suggests that Lernaeus may have a balanced ecosystem capable of sustaining both natural life and controlled cultivation. Whether Teg's garden is a private endeavor or part of a larger scientific institution remains unspecified, but its presence underscores the planet's importance as a place of learning and discovery alongside its role as a homeworld.  \n\nIn summary, Lernaeus is a multifaceted planet, serving as the native world for Firus and the Roxbroughs while also hosting Teg's research garden, indicating its dual significance as a living space and a center for botanical study.\",1\n1572,LETO ATREIDES I,\"The first Leto Atreides, grandfather of the Tyrant, whom Miles Teg resembles\",1\n1568,SOUTH FARM,\"**SOUTH FARM**  \n\n**SOUTH FARM** is a location within Teg's estate, primarily associated with agricultural activities and management. It is currently under the oversight of Firus, who is responsible for managing replanting efforts on the property. The farm is also referenced in relation to orders issued by Teg, suggesting it plays a significant role in the estate's operations, whether for cultivation, resource management, or other logistical purposes.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provide slightly different contexts—one emphasizing its replanting management and the other its connection to Teg's directives—they collectively depict **SOUTH FARM** as an active and strategically important part of Teg's estate. There are no direct contradictions between the two descriptions; rather, they complement each other by highlighting different aspects of the farm's function and governance.  \n\nIn summary, **SOUTH FARM** serves as a key agricultural site within Teg's estate, managed by Firus for replanting and subject to orders from Teg, indicating its operational and possibly economic significance.\",1\n1679,BASHAR'S QUARTERS,\"Teg's private living and working space within the Keep\"\"\",1\n1702,THE GUILDSHIP,The ship where Taraza and Teg interacted before their current situation,1\n1705,THE FAMINE TIMES,Historical period referenced in Teg's thoughts about Gammu's wilderness,1\n1708,FIVE ATTITUDES,The Five Attitudes are Bene Gesserit combat techniques taught to Teg by his mother,1\n1741,MARKON,The Battle of Markon is a historical event where Teg's reputation caused the enemy to sue for terms.,1\n1742,ARBELOUGH,The Battle of Arbelough is a historical event where Teg shared risks with his troops and spared the enemy.,1\n1743,KROININ,The assault on Kroinin is a historical event where Teg broke the anti-Sisterhood forces.,1\n1788,BATTLE OF PONCIARD,A conflict recalled by Teg involving his woolen clothing and command pod odors>,1\n1624,WINTER SHOW,\"The **WINTER SHOW** is an event referenced by Miles Teg in two distinct contexts. In one instance, Teg recalls it as a childhood performance featuring puppets named **Dit, Dat, and Dot**, suggesting a playful and nostalgic memory. In another, he compares the illusions of Face Dancers to a magician's act from the same show, implying it also included sleight-of-hand or deceptive performances.  \n\nThese descriptions may seem contradictory at first—one emphasizing puppetry and the other magic—but they can be reconciled as a multifaceted event. The **WINTER SHOW** likely combined different acts, such as puppet shows and magic performances, catering to varied entertainment tastes. Teg's references highlight different aspects of the show: the puppets as a personal childhood memory and the magician as a point of comparison for advanced deception.  \n\nIn summary, the **WINTER SHOW** was a versatile event featuring both puppetry (with characters like Dit, Dat, and Dot) and magic acts, leaving a lasting impression on Teg, who drew upon its elements in later reflections. The dual descriptions enrich its portrayal as a memorable spectacle blending whimsy and illusion.\",1\n1806,PLANETARY BANK OF GAMMU,The Planetary Bank of Gammu owns the groundcar Teg is using for transport. It was one of his contact points during his inspection tour.,1\n1810,SOLITZ,\"**SOLITZ** is a trained **Suk doctor** who specializes in medical examinations and treatments. Recognizable by the **orange brand or tattoo** on his forehead—a distinctive mark of his Suk training—he is skilled in assessing and addressing health concerns. In one instance, he examines **Teg**, likely evaluating the aftereffects of a stunner, and prescribes a meal tailored to Teg's specific needs. His expertise and attention to individual requirements highlight his proficiency as a medical professional within the Suk tradition. The descriptions align in portraying him as a competent and attentive healer, with minor variations in terminology (brand vs. tattoo) that do not contradict his identity or role.  \n\n(Word count: 100)\",1\n1851,SCANLYZER CONTROLS,,1\n1855,YSAL,\"Ysai is the city where Teg is currently located, seeking help and refuge\"\"\",1\n1856,ACLINE,\"Acline is another past battle where Teg served, known for saving many lives\"\"\",1\n2045,MARINETE,\"Marinete is referenced by Teg as a drink he desires, possibly an event or significant substance.\"\"\",1\n2071,HAKER,\"**HAKER** serves as **Teg's personal aide**, assisting in various capacities during combat and tactical operations. Primarily, Haker is responsible for providing updates to Teg and executing orders during battles. Additionally, Haker plays a key role in managing **Honored Matre prisoners**, ensuring compliance with Teg's directives. This dual responsibility highlights Haker's importance in both active combat support and post-conflict operations, acting as a trusted subordinate in Teg's command structure.  \n\nThe descriptions align in depicting Haker as a loyal and efficient aide, consistently carrying out Teg's orders in high-stakes situations. There are no contradictions; rather, the details complement each other to form a cohesive role encompassing battlefield coordination and prisoner oversight.\",1\n2072,COMMAND POD,\"Teg's Command Pod is a critical piece of military equipment that was destroyed in the battle\"\"\",1\n2077,SPACE BATTLE,\"Prior conflict where Teg's forces defeated Honored Matre ships\"\"\",1\n2088,HONORED MATRE AERIE,\"The Honored Matre stronghold where Teg was held\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3667,TEG,TARAZA,\"**Summary of TEG and TARAZA:**  \n\nTaraza is a high-ranking Bene Gesserit leader and serves as Teg’s superior, overseeing his actions with a relationship built on trust and strategic collaboration. As a Mentat Bashar, Teg follows Taraza’s orders meticulously, executing her plans with loyalty and precision, particularly in matters concerning the Bene Gesserit. Their partnership is highlighted by their involvement in a crucial mission involving the Duncan Idaho ghola, where Taraza recruits Teg to play a key role. Teg later references Taraza’s predictions about Duncan’s independence, indicating their shared responsibility in shaping the ghola’s training and development.  \n\nTaraza demonstrates her trust in Teg by warning him about the Honored Matres, a dangerous faction threatening the Bene Gesserit. However, their collaboration is cut short when Teg informs Lucilla that Taraza has been killed by the Honored Matres, marking a significant loss for both Teg and the Bene Gesserit. Despite her death, Teg continues to act in accordance with Taraza’s strategic foresight, underscoring the enduring influence of their partnership.  \n\nIn summary, Taraza and Teg share a relationship defined by hierarchy, mutual respect, and strategic coordination. Taraza relies on Teg’s skills as a Mentat Bashar, while Teg remains fiercely loyal to her directives, even after her demise. Their work together—particularly concerning Duncan Idaho and the threat of the Honored Matres—shapes critical events within the Bene Gesserit’s broader schemes.\",151\n4375,YSAI,TEG,\"Teg is currently in Ysai, assessing the city's chaotic structure\",105\n3666,FIRUS,TEG,\"Firus, along with Patrin, knows what Teg wants regarding the South Farm\",104\n3687,TEG,JANET ROXBROUGH,\"**Summary of TEG and JANET ROXBROUGH:**  \n\nTeg is the ghola (a genetically engineered clone) of Janet Roxbrough's child, establishing a profound biological and emotional connection to his birth-mother. As her son, he inherits not only her legacy but also her home, further solidifying their familial bond. While the term \"\"ghola\"\" suggests a cloned or replicated existence, it does not diminish his status as Janet Roxbrough's descendant. Instead, it underscores the unique nature of their relationship, blending traditional familial ties with advanced scientific or cultural practices.  \n\nThe descriptions align in portraying Teg as Janet Roxbrough's offspring, whether through natural birth or ghola creation, and emphasize his role as her heir. There are no direct contradictions, as both statements affirm his lineage and inheritance. The summary reconciles the two perspectives by acknowledging Teg's dual identity—both as a ghola and as a son—while highlighting his connection to Janet Roxbrough's legacy and possessions.  \n\nIn essence, Teg is inextricably linked to Janet Roxbrough as her child, whether by birth or replication, and carries forward her heritage as her rightful successor.\",104\n4324,TEG,T-PROBE,\"**Summary of TEG and T-PROBE:**  \n\nTEG is an entity that has a complex and dynamic relationship with the T-PROBE, a technological or invasive mechanism capable of both extracting information and altering physical and cognitive states. The T-PROBE has been used to subject TEG to intrusive processes, including information extraction, which at times has impaired TEG's time perception and physical condition. Despite these adversarial interactions, TEG demonstrates the ability to analyze and resist the T-PROBE's intrusions, suggesting a degree of resilience or adaptive capability. Paradoxically, the T-PROBE has also played a role in unlocking enhanced abilities within TEG, indicating that its influence is not purely detrimental. This duality implies that the T-PROBE may serve multiple functions—extracting data, inducing impairments, and potentially activating latent capacities within TEG. The relationship between the two entities appears to be one of conflict and forced adaptation, with TEG enduring the T-PROBE's effects while also developing countermeasures and leveraging its enhancements.  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",104\n4325,TEG,LERNEAUS,\"Teg has ancestral ties to Lernaeus through his birth-mother and retains personal memories of childhood experiences on the same planet. This connection suggests a deep-rooted relationship with Lernaeus, both genealogically and emotionally, as Teg’s early life was shaped by time spent there.

Many of his former comrades from Renditai have since settled in Ysai, maintaining ties with him. Among those who remain loyal to Teg is a trusted officer originating from Renditai, further solidifying the bond between Teg and his past allies.
