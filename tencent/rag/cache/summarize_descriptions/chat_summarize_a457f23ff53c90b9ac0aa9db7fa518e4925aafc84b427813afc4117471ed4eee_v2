WAFF prays using the words of this tradition, indicating a deep connection to its linguistic and spiritual heritage. Additionally, WAFF employs the Islamiyat language for secret discussions, suggesting that the language holds both ceremonial and practical significance, possibly serving as a means of communication reserved for specific or confidential contexts.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight WAFF's dual use of the Islamiyat traditionâ€”both as a sacred practice in prayer and as a functional tool for discreet dialogue.
