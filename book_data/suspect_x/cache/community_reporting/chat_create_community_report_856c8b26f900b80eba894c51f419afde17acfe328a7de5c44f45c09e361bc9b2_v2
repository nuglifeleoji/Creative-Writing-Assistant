Once banished to a backwater punishment planet, she aged gracefully despite hardship, bearing shallow wrinkles around her mouth and bright, alert eyes—a testament to her enduring toughness. Dortujla’s rebellious nature and deep insights into the Honored Matres’ motives made her both an outcast and a valuable asset. She was experimented on by the Honored Matres, an experience that granted her critical intelligence for the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nAfter years in exile, Dortujla returned from her punishment post, hardened but unbroken, and resumed her duties. She was stationed at Buzzell, where she dispatched a messenger acolyte with vital information. Her role expanded as a representative for Sisters from surviving Keeps, standing in for them when necessary. Dortujla accompanied Odrade on missions, maintaining vigilance and expecting treachery, a reflection of her strategic mindset.  \n\nHer confrontation with the Spider Queen was a significant achievement, showcasing her courage and tactical prowess. Despite witnessing the horrific fate of her Sisters—some being eaten—she remained composed and resolute. Dortujla’s no-ship, used for smuggling operations, and her hobby of collecting old coins hint at her resourcefulness and layered personality.  \n\nThough initially withdrawn due to her traumatic experiences, Dortujla’s return carried immense importance for Odrade, who relied on her intelligence and resilience. At times, she was used as bait in strategic plans, underscoring her willingness to sacrifice for the Bene Gesserit’s survival. Ultimately, Dortujla embodies the order’s adaptability, blending rebellion with loyalty, and adversity with unyielding strength.\",4\r\n1183,BUZZELL,\"**Buzzell** is a cold, ocean-dominated planet, one of the last sixteen remaining under Bene Gesserit control. Its harsh environment consists of hardscrabble islands, making it a punishment post for the order. The planet is renowned for its valuable **soostones**, jewels produced by the Cholister sea creature, which have made it a hub for smuggling operations.  \n\nBuzzell holds strategic importance in the conflict between the Bene Gesserit and the **Honored Matres**, who covet the planet for its soostones and its potential to house amphibian slaves. The Great Honored Matre suspects Buzzell may be a trap due to its significance. The planet has also been the site of troubling incidents, including the abduction of **Reverend Mothers** by strangers—likely Honored Matres—who later brought them to **Dama**. Additionally, legends speak of an old witch once held on Buzzell before being taken to Dama, further entwining the planet with the power struggles of the era.  \n\nDespite its perilous state, Buzzell remains a key stronghold for the Bene Gesserit, though its future is uncertain amid ongoing losses in their planetary holdings. Its dual role as a resource-rich world and a site of conflict underscores its importance in the broader struggle for dominance.\",6\r\n1228,SOOSTONES,\"Soostones are highly valuable jewels produced by the Cholister sea creature on Buzzell.

Despite her exile, Dortujla has played a pivotal role in orchestrating key maneuvers, including dispatching messengers and managing clandestine activities.  \n\nHer presence on Buzzell is also part of a larger strategic ploy, as she is returning there to execute a plan aimed at baiting the Honored Matres—a dangerous and powerful faction. This suggests that her role extends beyond mere governance or survival, positioning her as a key player in broader political or military schemes.  \n\nBuzzell itself serves as both a place of punishment and a strategic stronghold, reflecting Dortujla’s ability to adapt and wield influence even in exile.
