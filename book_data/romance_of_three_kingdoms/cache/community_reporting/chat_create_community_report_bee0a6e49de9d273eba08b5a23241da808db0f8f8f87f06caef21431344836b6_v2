It was a significant political and military power, renowned for its military strength, strategies, and political maneuvers. Throughout this tumultuous era, 魏 frequently found itself in conflict with the Shu Han dynasty, often becoming the target of military campaigns led by Shu forces. \n\nThe state of 魏 was characterized by its military prowess, which was exemplified by its leadership under figures such as 曹睿 and 司马昭. These leaders were instrumental in orchestrating military campaigns and conquests that solidified 魏's position as a formidable rival to both Shu and Wu. The state was involved in numerous military conflicts, including sieges and battles, such as the besieging of 寿春 and attempts to breach the defenses of strategic locations like the sword pass.\n\nIn addition to its military engagements, 魏 was also known for its political intrigues and influence during the Three Kingdoms period.

Military leaders from 魏, such as 邓艾, played crucial roles in these conflicts, showcasing the state's capability to project military force and engage in complex strategies against its adversaries.\n\nOverall, 魏's legacy during the Three Kingdoms period is marked by its significant military strength and its ongoing rivalry with the Shu Han dynasty, as well as its interactions with Wu.

The yellow flag is associated with two distinct interpretations that reflect its dual significance in warfare.\n\nFirstly, the yellow flag symbolizes the presence of the renowned strategist 诸葛武侯 (Zhuge Liang) during battles, indicating his leadership and strategic prowess. Zhuge Liang, known for his intelligence and military acumen, was a key figure in the Shu Han state, and his presence on the battlefield was often marked by the display of the yellow flag. This representation underscores the importance of leadership in military campaigns and the morale boost that a capable leader can provide to their troops.\n\nConversely, the yellow flag is also recognized as a standard of the 曹军 (Cao army), which was led by Cao Cao, a prominent warlord of the time. In a notable incident, the flag was blown by the wind and fell into the river, an event that 周瑜 (Zhou Yu), a rival commander from the Eastern Wu state, interpreted as an ominous sign. This interpretation highlights the superstitions and beliefs surrounding military symbols in ancient China, where the loss or mishandling of a flag could be seen as a bad omen for the forces it represented.\n\nThe contrasting meanings of the yellow flag illustrate the complexities of its symbolism in the context of warfare. On one hand, it signifies the strategic leadership of Zhuge Liang, while on the other, it serves as a marker of the Cao army, with its misfortune interpreted as a harbinger of doom by their adversaries. This duality reflects the intricate interplay of fate, leadership, and the psychological aspects of warfare in ancient Chinese history.\n\nIn summary, the yellow flag is a multifaceted symbol that represents both the leadership of Zhuge Liang during battles and the standard of the Cao army, with its misfortune interpreted as an ill omen by Zhou Yu. This dual significance encapsulates the themes of leadership, strategy, and superstition that were prevalent in the military conflicts of the Three Kingdoms era.\",2\n1910,蜀,\"蜀, also known as the Shu Han kingdom, is a historical region in China that played a significant role during the Three Kingdoms period.

The kingdom faced constant threats, notably from the forces led by 邓艾 and 钟会, who sought to conquer the region. These military activities were crucial in shaping the political landscape of the time.\n\n蜀 was one of the three rival states, alongside Wei and Wu, and was often involved in complex alliances and conflicts. At various points, 蜀 considered forming alliances with Wu to counter the power of Wei, highlighting the intricate diplomatic maneuvers of the era. The kingdom's struggles against these rival states were marked by significant military engagements, which are well-documented in historical texts.\n\nThe emotional connection of the后主 to 蜀 is also noteworthy, as he longed for the kingdom and its legacy amidst the ongoing threats from the Jin dynasty's military campaigns.
