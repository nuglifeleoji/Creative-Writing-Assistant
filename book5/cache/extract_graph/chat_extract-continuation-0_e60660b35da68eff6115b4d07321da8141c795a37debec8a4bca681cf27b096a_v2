�亲住在这里。\n　　汪淼走到树桩写字台前。上面的陈设很简单，没有与学术有关的东西，也没有与女性有关的东西；也许都已经拿走了，也许从来就没在这里存在过，他首先注意到一张镶在木镜框中的黑白照片，是杨冬母女的合影，照片中的杨冬正值幼年，母亲蹲下正好同她一样高。风很大，将两人的头发吹到一起。照片的背景很奇怪，天空呈网格状，汪淼仔细察看支撑那网络的粗大的钢铁结构，推想那是一个抛物面天线或类似的东西，因为巨大，它的边缘超出了镜头。\n　　照片中，小杨冬的大眼睛中透出一种令汪淼心颤的恐惶，仿佛照片外的世界令她恐惧似的。汪淼注意到的第二件东西是放在写字台一角的一本厚厚的大本子，首先令他迷惑的是本子的材质，他看到封面上有一行稚拙的字：“杨冬的hua(桦)皮本。”这才知道这本子是桦树皮做的，时光已经使银白色的桦皮变成暗黄。他伸手触了一下本子，犹豫了一下又缩了回来。\n　　“你看吧，那是冬冬小时候的画儿。”杨母在门口说。\n　　汪淼捧起桦皮本，轻轻地一页页翻看。每幅画上都有日期，明显是母亲为女儿注上的，就像他刚进门时看到的那样。汪淼又发现了一件多少让他不可理解的事：从画上的日期看，这时的杨冬已经三岁多了，这么大的孩子通常都能够画出比较分明的人或物体的形状；但杨冬的画仍然只是随意纷乱的线条，汪淼从中看出了一种强烈的恼怒和绝望，一种想表达某种东西又无能为力的恼怒和绝望，这种感觉，是这种年龄的普通孩子所不具有的。\n　　杨母缓缓地坐到床沿上，双眼失神地看着汪淼手中的桦皮本，她女儿就是在这里，在安睡中结束自己的生命。汪淼在杨母身边坐下，他从来没有过如此强烈的愿望，要与他人分担痛苦。\n　　杨母从汪淼手中拿过桦皮本，抱在胸前，轻声说：“我对冬冬的教育有些不知深浅，让她太早接触了那些太抽象，太终极的东西。当她第一次表现出对那些抽象理论的兴趣时，我告诉她，那个世界，女人是很难进入的。她说居里夫人不是进入了吗？我告诉她，居里夫人根本没有进入，她的成功只是源于勤奋和执着，没有她，那些工作别人也会完成，倒是像吴健雄(当代最杰出的特理学家之一，在实验物理学研究上取得伟大的成就。她在实验室中首次证明了李政道和杨振宁关于弱相互作用中宇称不守恒的理论推测，推翻了宇称守恒定律。)这样的女人还比她走得\n######################\nOutput:",
