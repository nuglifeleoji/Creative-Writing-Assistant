\n　　“噢……”贾冰看来有点印象。 \n　　孙少平立刻用简短的话说明他的卑微的来意。 \n　　“那先回窑里再说。”贾冰从地上拾起他的黄提包，引着他进了窑。 \n　　窑里一位中年妇女正在一个大盆里翻洗猪肠子。贾冰对她说：“这是咱们县的一位老乡，到黄原来揽工，晚上没处住，找到这里来了。” \n　　那位妇女大概是贾冰的爱人。她既没看一眼少平，也没说话，看来相当不欢迎他这个不速之客，少平并不因此就对贾冰的爱人产生坏看法。他估计这家人已经不知接待了多少象他这样来黄原谋生的亲戚和老乡，天长日久，自然会生出点厌烦情绪来。 \n　　“你吃了饭没？”贾冰问。 \n　　“吃了。”他散谎说。 \n　　“来揽工？” \n　　“嗯。” \n　　“为什么？你不是上过高中吗？” \n　　“嗯。” \n　　“那为什么跑出来揽工？” \n　　“我一时也说不清楚……” \n　　“你喜欢诗歌吗？” \n　　“我……” \n　　“噢……黄原的钱也不好赚！” \n　　少平敏感地意识到，如果他同贾老师说，他喜欢诗歌，并且念出什么人的几句来，说不定他今晚会得到较好的接待。但他谈不到对诗歌有什么特别的爱好。他不愿在这方面撒谎。现在他猜想，诗人大概把他看成了一个纯粹为赚钱而借宿的凡夫俗子，因此不可能对他有什么兴趣。 \n　　不过，看来贾老师念过去的一面交情，还不准备把他拒之门外。他把他引在隔壁一个放杂物的小土窑里，说：“这窑常不生火，可能有点冷，你就凑合着住吧！” \n　　“这就蛮好了！”他感激地说。 \n　　晚上，少平躺在自己单薄的被褥里，很久合不住眼。他想，这里看来只能借宿一个晚上。 \n　　明天一早，他就应该去北关的阳沟大队找那位远门亲戚，争取在那里住下来。然后他得千方百计找个营生干；只要有活做，有个吃住的地方，哪怕先不赚钱都可以…… \n                  第13章\n　　第二天窗户纸刚发亮，少平就悄悄地爬起来。 \n　　他到院子里的时候，贾冰一家人还在熟睡之中。他很快离开这里，转到了街道上。 \n　　从南关通往北关的大街上，除过赶长途汽车的旅客外，此刻还没有什么人。 \n　　他迎着清冷的晨风，在静悄悄的街道上匆忙地走着。城市的一切在他眼里都是模糊的，他现在一心想的只是要找到那位没见过面的亲戚。 \n　　赶到北关的时候，天已经大亮了。 \n　　他从一个扫街道老头那里打问清楚了去阳沟的路。于是在黄原宾�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
