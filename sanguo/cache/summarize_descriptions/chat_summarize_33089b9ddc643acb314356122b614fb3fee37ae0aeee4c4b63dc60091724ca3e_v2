Appointed by Emperor Cao Rui, he played a crucial role in leading the Wei army against the Shu troops, particularly in strategic military engagements at critical locations such as the Yangping Pass. Throughout his military career, Cao Zhen collaborated closely with fellow general Guo Huai, working together on various military strategies to counter the Shu forces.\n\nDespite his initial skepticism regarding the presence of Shu troops, Cao Zhen's attitude shifted as he faced the realities of battle. He experienced significant stress from the ongoing conflict, which ultimately led to his illness. Even while unwell, he remained engaged in discussions about the military situation, demonstrating his commitment to the Wei cause. However, the pressures of warfare took a toll on him, and he faced defeats against the Shu army, particularly under the command of the renowned strategist Zhuge Liang.\n\nCao Zhen's military career was marked by both his strong presence on the battlefield and the challenges he encountered. He was known for his strategic insights and was involved in critical decisions regarding troop movements and engagements. Unfortunately, his life was cut short when he died in the army after a battle, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated and capable general who served the Wei state during a pivotal era in Chinese history. His contributions to the military efforts against Shu and his role in supporting the young Emperor Cao Rui after the death of Cao Pi highlight his importance in the Wei military hierarchy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898887, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 733, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
