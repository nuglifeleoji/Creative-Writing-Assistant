不可思议的是，在跟美里解释的过程中，靖子的心情也逐渐镇定下来了，开始能够冷静地思考，于是她更加觉得自己别无选择，她不想让美里变成杀人犯的女儿，然而这个事\n\n实既而无法逃避，至少得选个比较不会遭到社会冷眼唾骂的方式。\n    靖子瞥向滚落屋内一隅的无线电话，伸手去拿话机。\n    “不行啦！”美里迅速冲过来，企图从母亲手中夺走电话。\n    “放手！”\n    “不行！”美里抓住靖子的手腕，可能是因为平常打羽毛球，她的力气很大。\n    “拜托你放开我。”\n    “不要，我不能让妈妈这么做，不然我去自首好了。”\n    “你在说什么傻话！”\n    “因为最先打他的人是我。妈妈只是想救我。我也中途帮了妈妈，我也是杀人凶手。”\n    美里的话，令靖子悚然一惊，霎时，握着电话的手放松了力气。美里没错过这个机会，立刻夺走了电话，一把抱进怀里藏起来，走到屋里内角落背对靖子。\n    警方会――靖子开始动脑筋。\n    刑警们真的会相信我的话吗？对我一个人杀死富坚的供述不会提出质疑吗？他们会完全相信吗？\n    警方一定会彻底调查。她在看电视连续剧时，曾听过“查证”这个台词。他们会动用各种方法，确认犯人的说词是真是假。例如四处打听、科学侦查、还有其他等等――如果\n\n被刑警查出什么就完了。纵使她哀求警方放过女儿，对方也不可能答应。\n    能不能伪装成是自己一个人杀的呢？靖子想，但立刻就放弃了这个念头。外行人即使动这种拙劣的手脚，肯定也会被轻易识破。\n    话虽如此，但她非保护美里不可，靖子想。只因为有自己这样的母亲，害得女儿从小就几乎没过什么好日子，唯有这个可怜的女儿，就是拼了自己的命也绝不能让她更加不幸\n\n。\n    那么到底该怎么办呢？有什么好办法吗？\n    就在这时。美里抱着的电话响了，她瞪大了眼看着靖子。\n    靖子默默伸出手。美里一脸犹豫，最后还是缓缓地递出电话。\n    靖子调整好呼吸，按下通话键。\n    “喂？您好，我是花冈。”\n    “呃，我是隔壁的石神。”\n    “啊……”又是那个老师，这次又想做什么？“有什么事吗？”\n    “呃，那个，我在想你们不知决定得怎么样了。”\n    她完全听不懂他在问什么。\n    “你说什么？”\n    “我是说，”石神停了一拍才继续说道，“如果要报警的话，那我毫无意见，不过如果没这个打算，我想我或许帮得上忙。”\n
