\n　　刘玉升说：“本来咱们同村邻居，我不能收你们的东四。但这是阴曹下面的规定，不收也不行……” \n　　孙玉厚赶忙说：“那怎能哩！”他随即又揭开那只旧木箱，把一块二尺左右的红布也拿出来，连同粮食一起放到刘玉升面前。 \n　　刘玉升把红布塞在棉襟子里，把那袋小麦扛在肩头，就要起身走了。 \n　　“我拿手电把你送一下。”孙玉厚说。 \n　　“不用了！我们这号人白天和晚上一样，都能看见路哩……噢，我倒忘了！你们今晚上用一斤白面捏成两个猪像，在灶火里烧热，赶天不明时送到田家圪崂下面的河湾里，放在一块干净石头上，周围划一个圆圈。白狗精走时，歪好吃上一点，以后就不会记仇了……” \n　　孙玉厚老两口连连点头应承了下来。 \n　　刘玉升走后，少安妈就用一斤多白面捏了两个“猪像”，在灶火里精心烧烤得焦黄喷香。 \n　　天不明时，孙玉厚按刘玉升指定的地点，把这两块吃食送到东拉河岸边一块干净石头上，用手指头在周围划了一个圈圈。 \n　　玉厚老汉怎能想到，他离开河岸不久，刘玉升就来到这里，把这两块还温热的吃食拿回家，给他的六个小“白狗精”分着吃了…… \n　　第二天早晨，孙玉厚他妈对儿子和媳妇说，她的肚子好些了。孙玉厚两口子在高兴的同时，对刘玉升敬佩得五体投地。 \n　　可是好景不长！中午时分，老人的病情突然加重了——肚子疼得在一堆破棉絮中滚来滚去！ \n　　孙玉厚大惊失色，赶紧把孙玉亭叫下来，弟兄俩不敢再瞎折腾，手忙脚乱把老母亲拉到石圪节医院。 \n　　医生一检查，是肚子里有蛔虫；随即给开了一瓶“驱蛔灵”。 \n　　老人回到家，吃了两次药，就屙出了几条蛔虫，肚子自然也就不再疼了。 \n
