The dancers were overwhelmed by the crush, swept aside like ships caught in a gigantic wave. Odrade saw spots of naked flesh being pummeled and thrust from hand to hand through the screaming chaos. Only by the most intense concentration could Odrade separate the sounds being Carried up to her.\nIt was madness!\nNone of the dancers resisted. Were they being killed? Was it a sacrifice? The Sisterhood’s analyses did not even begin to touch this actuality.\nYellow helmets moved aside beneath Odrade, opening a way for Sheeana and her priestesses to pass into the building, then the Guardians closed ranks. They turned and formed a protective arc around the building’s entrance. They held their staves horizontally and overlapped at waist height.\nThe chaos beyond them began to subside. None of the dancers was visible but there were casualties, people sprawled on the ground, others staggering. Bloody heads could be seen.\nSheeana and the priestesses were out of Odrade’s view in the building. Odrade sat back and tried to sort out what she had just witnessed.\nIncredible.\nAbsolutely none of the Sisterhood’s accounts or holophoto records captured this thing! Part of it was the smells—dust, sweat, an intense concentration of human pheromones. Odrade took a deep breath. She felt herself trembling inside. The mob had become individuals who moved out into the bazaar. She saw weepers. Some cursed. Some laughed.\nThe door behind Odrade burst open. Sheeana entered laughing. Odrade whirled and glimpsed her own guards and some of the priestesses in the hallway before Sheeana closed the door.\nThe girl’s dark brown eyes glittered with excitement. Her narrow face, already beginning to soften with the curves she would display as an adult, was tense with suppressed emotion. The tension dissolved as she focused on Odrade.\nVery good, Odrade thought, as she observed this. Lesson one of the bonding already has begun.\n“You saw the dancers?” Sheeana demanded, whirling and Skipping across the floor to stop in front of Odrade. “Weren't they beautiful? | think they’re so beautiful! Cania didn’t want me to look. She says it’s dangerous for me to take part in Siaynoq. But | don’t care! Shaitan would never eat those dancers!”\nWith a sudden outflowing awareness, which she had experienced before only during the spice agony, Odrade saw through to the total pattern of what she had just witnessed in the Great Square. It had needed only Sheeana’s words and presence to make the thing clear.\nA language!\nDeep within the collective awareness of these people they carried, all unconsciously, a language that could say things to them they did not want to hear. The dancers spoke it. Sheeana spoke it. The thing was composed of voice tones and movements and pheromones, a complex and subtle combination that had evolved the way all languages evolved.\nOut of necessity.\nOdrade grinned at the happy girl standing in front of her. Now, Odrade knew how to trap the Tleilaxu. Now, she knew more of Taraza’s design.\nI must accompany Sheeana into the desert at the first opportunity. We will wait only for the arrival of this Tleilaxu Master, this Waff. We will take him with us!\nLiberty and Freedom are complex concepts. They go back to religious ideas of Free Will and are related to the Ruler Mystique implicit in absolute monarchs. Without absolute monarchs patterned after the Old Gods and ruling by the grace of a belief in religious indulgence, Liberty and Freedom would never have gained their present meaning. These ideals owe their very existence to past examples of oppression. And the forces that maintain such ideas will erode unless renewed by dramatic teaching or new oppressions. This is the most basic key to my life.\n—LETO II, GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE: DAR-ES-BALAT RECORDS\nS ome thirty kilometers into the thick forest northeast of the Gammu Keep, Teg kept them waiting under the cover of a life-shield blanket until the sun dipped behind the high ground to the west.\n“Tonight, we go a new direction,” he said.\nFor three nights now, he had led them through tree- enclosed darkness with a masterful demonstration of Mentat Memory, each step directed precisely along the track that Patrin had laid out for him.\n“I’m stiff from too much sitting,” Lucilla complained. “And it’s going to be another cold night.”\nTeg folded the life-shield blanket and put it in the top of his pack. “You two can start moving around a bit,” he said. “But we won't leave here until full dark.”\nTeg sat up with his back against the bole of a thickly branched conifer, looking out from the deeper shadows as Lucilla and Duncan moved into the glade. The two of them stood there a moment, shivering as the last of the day’s warmth fled into the night’s chill. Yes, it would be cold again tonight, Teg thought, but they would have little chance to think about that.\nThe unexpected.\nSchwangyu would never expect them still to be this close to the Keep and on foot.\nTaraza should have been more emphatic in her warnings about Schwangyu, Teg thought. Schwangyu’s violent and open disobedience of a Mother Superior defied tradition. Mentat logic would not accept the situation without more data.\nHis memory brought up a saying from school days, one of those warning aphorisms by which a Mentat was supposed to rein in his logic.\n“Given a trail of logic, occam’s razor laid out with impeccable detail, the Mentat may follow such logic to personal disaster.”\nSo logic was known to fail.\nHe thought back to Taraza’s behavior on the Guildship and immediately afterward. She wanted me to know | would be completely on my own. | must see the problem in my own way, not in her way.\nSo the threat from Schwangyu had to be a real threat that he discovered and faced and solved on his own.\nTaraza had not known what would happen to Patrin because of all this.\nTaraza did not really care what happened to Patrin. Or to me. Or to Lucilla.\nBut what about the ghola?\nTaraza must care!\nIt was not logical that she would .. . Teg dumped this line of reasoning. Taraza did not want him to act logically. She wanted him to do exactly what he was doing, what he had always done in the tight spots.\nThe unexpected.\nSo there was a species of logic to all of this but it kicked the performers out of the nest into chaos.\nFrom which we must make our own order.\nGrief welled up in his consciousness. Patrin! Damn you, Patrin! You knew and I didn’t! What will | do without you?\nTeg could almost hear the old aide’s response, that stiffly formal voice Patrin always used when he was chiding his commander.\n“You will do your best, Bashar.”\nThe most coldly progressive reasoning said Teg would never again see Patrin in the flesh nor hear the old man’s actual voice. Still... the voice remained. The person persisted in memory.\n“Shouldn’t we be going?”\nIt was Lucilla, standing close in front of his position beneath the tree. Duncan waited beside her. Both of them had shouldered their packs.\nWhile he sat thinking, night had fallen. Rich starlight created vague shadows in the glade. Teg lifted himself to his feet, took his pack and, bending to avoid the low branches, emerged into the glade. Duncan helped Teg shoulder his pack.\n“Schwangyu will consider this eventually,” Lucilla said. “Her searchers will come after us here. You know it.”\n“Not until they have followed out the false trail and found the end of it,” Teg said. “Come.”\nHe led the way westward through an opening in the trees.\nThree nights he had led them along what he called “Patrin’s memory-path.” As he walked on this fourth night, Teg berated himself for not projecting the logical consequences of Patrin’s behavior.\nI understood the depths of his loyalty but I did not project that loyalty into a most obvious result. We were together so many years | thought | knew his mind as | knew my own. Patrin, damn you! There was no need for you to die!\nTeg admitted to himself then that there had been a need. Patrin had seen it. The Mentat had not permitted himself to see it. Logic could move just as blindly as any other faculty.\nAs the Bene Gesserit often said and demonstrated.\nSo we walk. Schwangyu does not expect this.\nTeg was forced to admit that walking the wild places of Gammu created a whole new perspective for him. This entire region had been allowed to overgrow with plant life during the Famine Times and the Scattering. It had been replanted later but mostly as a random wilderness. Secret trails and private landmarks guided today’s access. Teg imagined Patrin as a youth learning this region—that rocky butte visible in starlight through a gap in the trees, that spiked promontory, these lanes through giant trees.\n“They will expect us to make a run for a no-ship,” he and Patrin had agreed, fleshing out their plan. “The decoy must take the searchers in that direction.”\nPatrin had not said that he would be the decoy.\nTeg swallowed past a lump in his throat.\nDuncan could not be protected in the Keep, he justified himself.\nThat was true.\nLucilla had jittered through their first day under the life- Shield that protected them from discovery by the instruments of aerial searchers.\n“We must get word to Taraza!”\n“When we can.”\n“What if something happens to you? | must know all of your escape plan.”\n“If something happens to me, you will not be able to follow Patrin’s path. There isn’t time to put it in your memory.”\nDuncan took little part in the conversation that day. He watched them silently or dozed, awakening fitful and with an angry look in his eyes.\nOn the second day under the shielding blanket, Duncan suddenly demanded of Teg: “Why do they want to kill me?”\n“To frustrate the Sisterhood’s plan for you,” Teg said.\nDuncan glared at Lucilla. “What is that plan?”\nWhen Lucilla did not answer, Duncan said: “She knows. She knows because I’m supposed to depend on her. I’m\nSupposed to love her!”\nTeg thought Lucilla concealed her dismay quite well. Obviously, her plans for the ghola had fallen into disarray, all of the sequencing thrown out of joint by this flight.\nDuncan’s behavior revealed another possibility: Was the ghola a latent Truthsayer? What additional powers had been bred into this ghola by the sly Tleilaxu?\nAt their second nightfall in the wilderness, Lucilla was full of accusations. “Taraza ordered you to restore his original memories! How can you do that out here?”\n“When we reach sanctuary.”\nA silent and acutely alert Duncan accompanied them that night. There was a new vitality in him. He had heard!\nNothing must harm Teg, Duncan thought. Wherever and whatever sanctuary might be, Teg must reach it safely. Then, | will know!\nDuncan was not sure what he would know but now he fully accepted the prize in it. This wilderness must lead to that goal. He recalled staring out at the wild places from the Keep and how he had thought to be free here. That sense of untouched freedom had vanished. The wilderness was only a path to something more important.\nLucilla, bringing up the rear of this march, forced herself to remain\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit sister who witnesses the chaotic events in the Great Square and plans to trap the Tleilaxu<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young girl with dark brown eyes and a narrow face, excited by the events in the Great Square and involved in the bonding process with Odrade<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANIA<|>PERSON<|>Cania is someone who advises Sheeana against participating in Siaynoq, considering it dangerous<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>Waff is a Tleilaxu Master whom Odrade plans to take into the desert with Sheeana<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is a Bene Gesserit Mother Superior whose designs and warnings are referenced by Odrade and Teg<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a Mentat and Bashar who leads Lucilla and Duncan through the wilderness, grieving for Patrin and avoiding Schwangyu's searchers<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a Bene Gesserit sister accompanying Teg and Duncan, concerned about the cold and their safety<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan is a ghola with latent abilities, whose original memories Teg is supposed to restore<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Patrin is Teg's loyal aide who sacrificed himself as a decoy to mislead Schwangyu's searchers<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Schwangyu is a Bene Gesserit who disobeys Taraza and poses a threat to Teg, Lucilla, and Duncan<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood is a powerful organization with plans involving Duncan and other key figures<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a group Odrade plans to trap, with Waff as their representative<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GREAT SQUARE<|>GEO<|>The Great Square is where the chaotic events involving the dancers and the mob occur<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU KEEP<|>GEO<|>Gammu Keep is the starting point of Teg, Lucilla, and Duncan's journey through the wilderness<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIAYNOQ<|>EVENT<|>Siaynoq is an event or ritual that Sheeana is excited about, considered dangerous by Cania<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SPICE AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The spice agony is a transformative experience referenced by Odrade<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade observes Sheeana and plans to accompany her into the desert, initiating a bonding process<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>WAFF<|>Odrade plans to trap the Tleilaxu by taking Waff into the desert<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TARAZA<|>Odrade references Taraza's designs and plans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>LUCILA<|>Teg leads Lucilla through the wilderness, discussing their escape plan<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>DUNCAN<|>Teg is responsible for restoring Duncan's original memories and protecting him<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>PATRIN<|>Teg grieves for Patrin, who sacrificed himself as a decoy for their escape<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>SCHWANGYU<|>Teg avoids Schwangyu's searchers, recognizing her as a threat<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>DUNCAN<|>Lucilla is supposed to bond with Duncan, but their plans are disrupted by the flight<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>TARAZA<|>Duncan is part of the Sisterhood's plan, which Taraza oversees<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE SISTERHOOD<|>THE TLEILAXU<|>The Sisterhood plans to trap the Tleilaxu, with Odrade leading the effort<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>CANIA<|>Cania advises Sheeana against participating in Siaynoq<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>SIAYNOQ<|>Sheeana is excited about Siaynoq and wants to participate<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>THE GREAT SQUARE<|>Odrade witnesses the chaotic events in the Great Square<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GAMMU KEEP<|>Teg and his group flee from Gammu Keep into the wilderness<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
