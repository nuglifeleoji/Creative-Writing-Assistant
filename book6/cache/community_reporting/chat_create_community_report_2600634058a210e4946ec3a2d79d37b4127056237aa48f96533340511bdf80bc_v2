This aspect of the fleet underscores its commitment to the welfare of its personnel, ensuring that they have support even after their active service.\n\nOverall, the \"\"舰队\"\" is a complex organization that balances military operations with scientific exploration and diplomatic engagement, reflecting its critical role in contemporary space operations and international relations.\",19\r\n735,亚当号,亚当号是一艘战舰，隶属于联合舰队，参与了多场太空战斗。作为联合舰队中的最后一艘战舰，亚当号在其服役期间展现了卓越的战斗能力和战略价值。然而，最终它的命运悲惨，亚当号被核火球吞噬，结束了其辉煌的战斗历程。,2\r\n736,恒河号,恒河号是一艘恒星级巨舰，隶属于联合舰队。在战斗中，恒河号正朝向敌方舰队的方向飞行，展现出其作为战舰的积极参与。然而，在激烈的战斗中，恒河号遭遇了攻击，最终被水滴击穿并摧毁。这一事件标志着恒河号在战斗中的悲惨结局，反映了战斗的残酷性和舰船在冲突中的脆弱性。,2\r\n706,历史时刻,\"The historical moment refers to the launch of the United Fleet, which is celebrated as a significant event in human history.\",1\r\n737,战场信息系统,战场信息系统负责记录和分析战斗信息，帮助指挥官做出决策。,1\r\n738,计算机战场决策系统,计算机战场决策系统用于分析战场信息并提供决策支持。,1\r\n760,里萨海战,\"The Battle of Risa was a historical naval battle in 1811, referenced as the last successful use of direct ship collision tactics.\",1\r\n761,甲午海战,\"The First Sino-Japanese War naval battle, noted for the tragedy of the Zhiyuan ship, which led to the abandonment of direct collision tactics.\",1\r\n720,考察队,\"考察队 is the exploration team consisting of four members, including 丁仪 and 东方, tasked with a mission in space.\",6\r\n27,三体世界,\"The Trisolaran world, known as 三体世界, is a fictional universe that serves as the backdrop for a complex narrative involving humanity's interactions with an alien civilization. This extraterrestrial civilization is characterized by its harsh desert environment and the unique challenges it faces, including the threat of being consumed by its three suns. The Trisolaran civilization has a history marked by cycles of disaster, leading them to seek a stable home and sun.\n\nIn the narrative, the Trisolaran world is depicted as a significant entity that humanity is preparing to confront through the formation of the United Fleet. This preparation is underscored by the ongoing communication between the Trisolarans and Earth, which has occurred through low-frequency signals. The interactions between these two civilizations are fraught with tension, as the Trisolarans possess advanced technology but are also depicted as having a slow pace of technological development compared to humanity.\n\nThe Trisolaran civilization is not only a potential adversary but also a participant in peace negotiations with humanity, which could significantly influence the outcome of their interactions. The narrative suggests that the Trisolarans are closely monitoring the research of key human figures, such as 罗辑, indicating a strategic interest in human advancements and potential threats.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the Trisolaran world emerges as a complex civilization with its own strategic goals and existential threats, which may pose a significant risk to humanity. The presence of Trisolaran probes sent to the solar system further emphasizes the urgency of the situation, as these actions are perceived as a direct threat to human existence.\n\nOverall, the Trisolaran world represents a multifaceted alien civilization that embodies both the potential for conflict and the possibility of cooperation, set against the backdrop of a galaxy where survival and stability are paramount.\",19\r\n405,宇宙射线捕捉器,宇宙射线捕捉器是高边疆号任务的一部分，旨在收集宇宙射线。,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1368,罗辑,旧城区,罗辑和史强从旧城区出发，驶向西方,234\r\n1139,水滴,捕获行动,水滴是捕获行动的目标，螳螂号的任务是接触水滴。,57\r\n1176,无限边疆号,水滴,\"The entity known as \"\"水滴\"\" (Water Drop) engaged in a catastrophic collision with \"\"无限边疆号\"\" (Infinite Frontier). This incident occurred at an extremely high velocity, resulting in significant damage to the Infinite Frontier's hull. The impact created a circular hole in the ship's structure, which subsequently triggered a massive explosion.\n\nIn addition to the initial collision, the Water Drop penetrated the hull of the Infinite Frontier, leading to a nuclear fusion reaction. This reaction caused the ship's material to melt, exacerbating the destruction already inflicted by the impact. The combination of the high-speed collision and the ensuing nuclear event resulted in a catastrophic failure of the Infinite Frontier, marking a devastating moment in its operational history. \n\nOverall, the encounter between the Water Drop and the Infinite Frontier was marked by extreme violence and destruction, culminating in the ship's severe structural compromise and the release of immense energy due to the fusion reaction.\",57\r\n1182,远方号,水滴,水滴穿透了远方号并引发核火球。,56\r\n1183,雾角号,水滴,水滴穿透了雾角号并引发核火球。,56\r\n1184,南极洲号,水滴,水滴穿透了南极洲号并引发核火球。,56\r\n1237,夏号,水滴,夏号在水滴的攻击中未能逃脱，最终被摧毁。,56\r\n1161,中校,水滴,中校参与了对水滴的接触和观察，表现出对其特性的惊奇,55\r\n1185,极限号,水滴,水滴穿透了极限号并引发核火球。,54\r\n1195,哥伦比亚号,水滴,水滴击穿了哥伦比亚号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1196,正义号,水滴,水滴击穿了正义号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1197,马萨达号,水滴,水滴击穿了马萨达号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1198,质子号,水滴,水滴击穿了质子号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1199,炎帝号,水滴,水滴击穿了炎帝号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1200,大西洋号,水滴,水滴击穿了大西洋号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1201,天狼号,水滴,水滴击穿了天狼号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1202,感恩节号,水滴,水滴击穿了感恩节号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1203,前进号,水滴,水滴击穿了前进号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1204,汉号,水滴,水滴击穿了汉号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1205,暴风雨号,水滴,水滴击穿了暴风雨号并导致其摧毁,54\r\n1206,第二队列,水滴,水滴在战斗中摧毁了第二队列,54\r\n1207,第三队列,水滴,水滴在战斗中攻击了第三队列中的战舰,54\r\n1208,第一队列,水滴,水滴在战斗中与第一队列的战舰发生冲突,54\r\n1209,牛顿号,水滴,水滴穿透了牛顿号战舰,54\r\n1210,启蒙号,水滴,水滴穿透了启蒙号战舰,54\r\n1211,白垩纪号,水滴,水滴穿透了白垩纪号战舰,54\r\n1227,水滴,纳尔逊号,纳尔逊号在太空战争中遭受水滴的攻击，并尝试进行拦截。,54\r\n1228,水滴,绿号,绿号使用电磁动能武器向水滴射击以进行防御。,54\r\n1247,水滴,大毁灭,大毁灭是水滴对人类太空武装力量的攻击事件,54\r\n1380,北半球,水滴,水滴的减速现象在北半球被观察到，提醒人们注意这一天文事件。,54\r\n366,丁仪,泰勒,\"丁仪 and 泰勒 are engaged in a discussion about space and nuclear technology, with 泰勒 proposing a plan that 丁仪 is skeptical about.\",49\r\n1109,自然选择号,太阳系联合舰队,太阳系联合舰队的行动可能与自然选择号的安全有关,38\r\n1113,量子号,联合舰队,\"量子号 is a significant vessel within the 联合舰队, playing a crucial role in military operations conducted in space.
