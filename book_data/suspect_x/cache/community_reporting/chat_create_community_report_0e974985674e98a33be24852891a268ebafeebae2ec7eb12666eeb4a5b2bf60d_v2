They are a technocracy known for producing advanced devices such as navigation tools, satellites, the cibus hood, Leto II's Royal Cart, and the lift in the Citadel's tower. Their creations often blur ethical boundaries, with rumors of experiments in artificial intelligence and automation, earning them both fear and suspicion.  \n\nDespite their technological prowess, the Ixians are politically manipulative, engaging in espionage and concealing their endeavors from others, including Leto II. They oppose his rule, employing unconventional tactics such as emotional manipulation through Hwi Noree, a paradoxically anti-mechanical individual they engineered to influence the God Emperor. Their involvement in political machinations extends to collaborations with the Tleilaxu and Face Dancers, as well as thefts of Leto’s sacred books.  \n\nWhile distrusted, the Ixians are tolerated for their dependability in manufacturing critical machinery, such as the lasgun and dictatel. They are implicated in conflicts like the attack on the temple and the struggle over Malky’s secrets. Their dual role as both innovators and subversives places them at odds with ruling powers, yet their technological contributions remain indispensable.  \n\nIn summary, the Ixians are a secretive, ambitious faction whose mastery of technology is matched only by their penchant for intrigue, making them a persistent and complex force in the empire’s political and technological landscape.\",21\r\n374,TLEILAX,\"Tleilax is a lone planet in the Thalim system, renowned as both a renegade training center for Mentats and the homeworld of the Bene Tleilax.

The Bene Tleilax, a powerful and enigmatic faction, are known for their mastery of genetic engineering and biological manipulation, further cementing Tleilax's reputation as a planet of both intellectual and scientific intrigue.
