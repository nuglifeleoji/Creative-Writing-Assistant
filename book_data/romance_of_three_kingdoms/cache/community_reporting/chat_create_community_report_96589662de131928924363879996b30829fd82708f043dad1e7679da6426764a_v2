In response to this peril, 王允 actively seeks to gather support from other officials and military leaders to oppose 董卓's rule.\n\nA key aspect of 王允's strategy involves orchestrating a plan to offer the beautiful courtesan 貂蝉 (Diao Chan) to 董卓, which serves as a pivotal element in his broader scheme to eliminate the tyrant. This plan is part of a larger conspiracy that ultimately leads to the assassination of 董卓, marking a significant turning point in the political landscape of the time. 王允's actions reflect his loyalty to the state and his commitment to restoring the Han dynasty's authority.\n\nDespite his efforts, 王允's political maneuvers place him in a precarious position, as he becomes a target himself.

The significance of 受禅台 extends beyond its immediate function as a platform; it represents the intersection of ritual, politics, and the delicate balance of power within the imperial court.\n\nIn summary, 受禅台 serves as a pivotal site for the ceremonial transfer of power, marking a key moment in the political landscape of the Han dynasty, particularly in relation to 董卓's ambitions to dominate the imperial authority.\",2\n362,江都,\"江都 is a location where孙策,孙坚's son, gathers support and consolidates power after his father's death.\",1\n376,宴,\"The entity \"\"宴\"\" refers to various banquets that played significant roles in the social and political landscapes of their respective contexts.

This smaller gathering was intended to facilitate discussions regarding the arrangement involving the famed beauty 貂蝉. The banquet's purpose was to navigate the complex political dynamics of the time, particularly in relation to the influence of women in political machinations and the manipulation of personal relationships for power gains.\n\nBoth banquets illustrate the multifaceted nature of social gatherings in ancient China, where food and hospitality were intertwined with political maneuvering and the establishment of alliances.
