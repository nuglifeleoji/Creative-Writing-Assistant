\n　　虽然这样时断时续地学，但他实际上早可以独立开汽车了。每当跟父亲外出时，路上都是由他来驾驶。只是临近城市的公路监理站，才把方向盘交到父亲手里。这当然是违章行为。但这类事也许永远不可能从公路上杜绝。 \n　　少平走罢不久，金波有点烦闷，很想再跟父亲外出跑一回。刚学会开车，有一种瘾，过段时间不摸方向盘，简直难以忍耐。另外，给少平叙说罢自己的心事，很想出去散淡两天……这心情就象大病初愈的人想到户外去走一走一样。这一天，他好不容易跟父亲上路了。 \n　　象往常一样，出黄原城不久，父亲就把车停在路边。两个人换了一下座位，他便接替父亲驾驶汽车，从公路上飞驰起来。他异常兴奋，那种把自己的身体和飞奔的汽车完全融为一体的快感是外人难以知晓的！ \n　　金俊海坐在儿子身边，一边抽烟，一边机警地注视着前方，看来随时都准备为儿子排除紧急事故。他是个容貌和内心都很和善的人，不象有些山区的汽车司机那样傲气十足。多少年来，他在公路上没出过什么大差错，年年都能在单位上领一张奖状。大半辈子了，无论是他本人还是他的家庭，日子过得都很平静。作为一个普通汽车司机，生活虽然不很富裕，但也不紧巴；老婆娃娃吃穿不缺，家里的木箱里面，还常压着千二八百的积蓄。 \n　　但金俊海现在心里却有了大熬煎。他发愁儿子的工作。他知道，儿子不愿回双水村劳动。他也舍不得，可是他又有什么能耐给他在黄原找工作呢？幸亏他在单位上人缘好，要不金波的临时工也怕干不了几天，就让单位上打发了。可是“临时”下去怎么办呀？这总不是个长远之计。 \n　　唯一的办法就是他提前退休，让金波顶班招工。可是儿子不让他这样做。想想也是，他今年还没满五十岁，闲呆着也的确不是个滋味。但不这样做，儿子的前程眼看要耽搁了。多少日子来，他白天黑夜都在为此而发愁。 \n　　现在，他不由地又和儿子说起了这件事。他一边两眼盯着挡风玻璃外的公路，一边咄咄呐呐说：“我看还是让我退了职，你顶我的班。” \n　　“你怎又说这事……”金波放慢了车速。 \n　　“要不你怎办呀？” \n　　“我慢慢想我的办法。”“你还是听爸爸的话。你已经二十三岁，没时间拖了……” \n　　“再等一等看。” \n　　“要是公家政策变了，不再让顶班招工，这就麻烦了！”金波不再言传。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
