Odrade thought. Dortujla is the kind of advisor | like to have near me. | wonder how many more such buried treasures are out there, tucked away for mean motives? Why do we so often shunt our talented ones aside? It’s an ancient weakness the Sisterhood has not exorcised.\n“I think we have learned something valuable about Honored Matres,” Dortujla said.\nThere was no need to nod agreement. This was the core of what had brought Dortujla to Chapterhouse. The ravening hunters had come swarming into the Old Empire, killing and burning wherever they suspected the presence of Bene Gesserit establishments. But the hunters had not touched Buzzell even though its location must be known.\n“Why?” Odrade asked, voicing what was in their minds.\n“Never damage your own nest,” Dortujla said.\n“You think they’re already on Buzzell?”\n“Not yet.”\n“But you believe Buzzell is a place they want.”\n“Prime projection.”\nOdrade merely stared at her. So Dortujla had another hobby! She burrowed into Other Memory, revived and perfected talents stored there. Who could blame her? Time must drag on Buzzell.\n“A Mentat summation,” Odrade accused.\n“Yes, Mother Superior.” Very meek. Reverend Mothers were supposed to dig into Other Memory this way only with Chapterhouse permission and then only with guidance and Support from companion Sisters. So Dortujla remained a rebel. She followed her own desires the way she had with her forbidden lover. Good! The Bene Gesserit needed such rebels.\n“They want Buzzell undamaged,” Dortujla said.\n“A water world?”\n“It would make a suitable home for amphibian servants. Not the Futars or Handlers. | studied them carefully.”\nThe evidence suggested a plan by Honored Matres to bring in enslaved servants, amphibians perhaps, to harvest soostones. Honored Matres could have amphibian slaves. Knowledge that produced Futars might create many forms of sentient life.\n“Slaves, dangerous imbalance,” Odrade said.\nDortujla showed her first strong emotion, deep revulsion that drew her mouth into a tight line.\nIt was a pattern the Sisterhood had long recognized: the inevitable failure of slavery and peonage. You created a reservoir of hate. Implacable enemies. If you had no hope of exterminating all of these enemies, you dared not try. Temper your efforts by the sure awareness that oppression will make your enemies strong. The oppressed will have their day and heaven help the oppressor when that day comes. It was a two-edged blade. The oppressed always learned from and copied the oppressor. When the tables were turned, the stage was set for another round of revenge and violence—roles reversed. And reversed and reversed ad nauseam.\n“Will they never mature?” Odrade asked.\nDortujla had no answer but she did have an immediate suggestion. “I must return to Buzzell.”\nOdrade considered this. Once more, the banished Reverend Mother was ahead of Mother Superior. As\ndisagreeable as the decision was, they both knew it as their best move. Futars and Handlers would return. More important, with a planet Honored Matres desired, odds were high that visitors from the Scattering had been observed. Honored Matres would have to make a move and that move could reveal much about them.\n“Of course, they think Buzzell is bait for a trap,” Odrade said.\n“I could let it be known that | was banished by my Sisters,” Dortujla said. “It can be verified.”\n“Use yourself as bait?”\n“Mother Superior, what if they could be tempted into a parley?”\n“With us?” What a startling idea!\n“I know their history is not one of reasonable negotiations but still...”\n“It’s brilliant! But let us make it even more enticing. Say | am convinced | must come to them with a proposal for submission of the Bene Gesserit.”\n“Mother Superior!”\n“I have no intention of surrendering. But what better way to get them to talk?”\n“Buzzell is not a good place for a meeting. Our facilities are very poor.”\n“They are on Junction in force. If they suggested Junction as a meeting place, could you let yourself be persuaded?”\n“It would take careful planning, Mother Superior.”\n“Oh, very careful.” Odrade’s fingers flickered in her console. “Yes, tonight,” she said answering a visible question, and then, speaking to Dortujla across the cluttered worktable: “I want you to meet with my Council and others before you return. We will brief you thoroughly but | give you my personal assurance you will have an open assignment. The important thing is to get them to a meeting on Junction... and |I hope you know how much | dislike using you as bait.”\nWhen Dortujla remained deep in thought and not responding, Odrade said: “They may ignore our overtures and wipe you out. Still, you’re the best bait we have.”\nDortujla showed she still had her sense of humor. “I don’t much like the idea of dangling on a hook myself, Mother Superior. Please keep a firm grip on the line.” She stood and, with a worried look at the work on Odrade’s table, said: “You have so much to do and | fear | have kept you far past lunch.”\n“We will dine here together, Sister. For the moment, you are more important than anything else.”\nAll states are abstractions.\n—OCTUN POLITICUS, BG ARCHIVES\nucilla cautioned herself not to assume too familiar a\nfeeling about this acid-green room and the recurring presence of Great Honored Matre. This was Junction, stronghold of the ones who sought extermination of the Bene Gesserit. This was the enemy. Day seventeen.\nThe infallible mental clock that had been set ticking during the Spice Agony told her she had adapted to the planet’s circadian rhythms. Awake at dawn. No telling when she would be fed. Honored Matre confined her to one meal a day.\nAnd always that Futar in its cage. A reminder: Both of you in cages. This is how we treat dangerous animals. We may let them out occasionally to stretch their legs and give us pleasure but back to the cage afterward.\nMinimal amounts of melange in the food. Not being parsimonious. Not with their wealth. A small show of “what could be yours if you would only be reasonable.”\nWhen will she come today?\nGreat Honored Matre arrivals had no set time. Random appearances to confuse the captive? Probably. There would be other demands on a commander’s time. Fit the dangerous pet into the regular schedule wherever you could.\nI may be dangerous, Spider Lady, but |! am not your pet.\nLucilla felt the presence of scanning devices, things that did more than provide stimulus for eyes. These looked into flesh, probing for concealed weapons, for the functioning of\norgans. Does she have strange implants? What about additional organs surgically added to her body?\nNone of those, Madame Spider. We rely on things that come with birth.\nLucilla knew her greatest immediate danger—that she would feel inadequate in such a setting. Her captors had her at a terrible disadvantage but they had not destroyed her Bene Gesserit capabilities. She could will herself to die before the shere in her body was depleted to the point of betrayal. She still had her mind... and the horde from Lampadas.\nThe Futar panel opened and it came sliding out in its cage. So Spider Queen was on her way. Displaying threat ahead of her as usual. Early today. Earlier than ever.\n“Good morning, Futar.” Lucilla sooke with a merry lilt.\nThe Futar looked at her but did not speak.\n“You must hate it in that cage,” Lucilla said.\n“Not like cage.”\nShe had already determined that these creatures possessed a degree of language facility but the extent of it still eluded her.\n“I suppose she keeps you hungry, too. Would you like to eat me?”\n“Eat.” Definite show of interest.\n“I wish | were your Handler.”\n“You Handler?”\n“Would you obey me if | were?”\nSpider Queen’s heavy chair lifted from its concealment under the floor. No sign of her yet but it had to be assumed She listened to these conversations.\nThe Futar stared at Lucilla with peculiar intensity.\n“Do Handlers keep you caged and hungry?”\n“Handler?” Clear inflections of a question.\n“I want you to kill Great Honored Matre.” That would be no surprise to them.\n“Kill Dama!”\n“And eat her.”\n“Dama poison.” Dejected.\nOoooh. Isn't that an interesting bit of information!\n“She’s not poison. Her meat is the same as mine.”\nThe Futar approached her to the cage’s limits. The left hand peeled down its lower lip. Angry redness of a scar there, appearance of a burn.\n“See poison,” it said, dropping its hand.\nI wonder how she did that? No smell of poison about her. Human flesh plus adrenaline-based drug to produce orange eyes in response to anger... and those other responses Murbella revealed. A sense of absolute superiority.\nHow far did Futar comprehension go? “Was it a bitter poison?”\nThe Futar grimaced and spat.\nAction faster and more powerful than words.\n“Do you hate Dama?”\nBared canines.\n“Do you fear her?”\nSmile.\n“Then why don’t you kill her?”\n“You not Handler.”\nIt requires a kill command from a Handler!\nGreat Honored Matre entered and sank into her chair.\nLucilla pitched her voice in the merry lilt: “Good morning, Dama.”\n“I did not give you permission to call me that.” Low and with beginning flecks of orange in the eyes.\n“Futar and | have been having a conversation.”\n“I know.” More orange in the eyes. “And if you have spoiled him forme...”\n“But Dama—”\n“Don’t call me that!” Out of her chair, eyes blazing orange.\n“Do sit down,” Lucilla said. “This is no way to conduct an interrogation.” Sarcasm, a dangerous weapon. “You said\nyesterday you wanted to continue our discussion of politics.”\n“How do you know what time it is?” Sinking back in her chair but eyes still flaming.\n“All Bene Gesserit have this ability. We can feel the rhythms of any planet after a short time on it.”\n“A strange talent.”\n“Anyone can do it. A matter of being sensitized.”\n“Could | learn this?” Orange fading.\n“I said anyone. You're still human, aren’t you?” A question not yet fully answered.\n“Why do you say you witches have no government?”\nWants to change the subject. Our abilities worry her. “That’s not what I said. We have no conventional government.”\n“Not even a social code?”\n“There’s no such thing as a social code to meet all necessities. A crime in one society can be a moral requirement in another society.”\n“People always have government.” Orange completely faded. Why does this interest her so much?\n“People have politics. | told you that yesterday. Politics: the art of appearing candid and completely open while concealing as much as possible.”\n“So you witches conceal.”\n“I did not say that. When we Say ‘politics,’ that’s a warning to our Sisters.”\n“I don’t believe you. Humans always create some form Olena\n“Accord?”\n“As good a word as any!” It angers her.\nWhen Lucilla made no further response, Great Honored Matre leaned forward. “You're concealing!”\n“Isn't it my right to hide from you things that might help you defeat us?” There’s a juicy morsel of bait!\n“I thought so!” Leaning back with a look of satisfaction.\n“However\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, a powerful and strategic leader who makes key decisions for the Sisterhood, including negotiations with the Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORTUJLA<|>PERSON<|>Dortujla is a banished Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, known for her rebellious nature and deep insights into the Honored Matres' motives.
