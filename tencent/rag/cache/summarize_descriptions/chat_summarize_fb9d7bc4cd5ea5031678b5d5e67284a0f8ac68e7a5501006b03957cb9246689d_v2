Some accounts describe the Handlers as individuals who accompany and manage the Futars, while others emphasize their role as commanders, directing the Futars to kill.  \n\nThough their origins and true intentions are ambiguous, the Handlers are consistently portrayed as a significant force from the Scattering, operating in conjunction with the Futars to challenge or undermine the Honored Matres.
