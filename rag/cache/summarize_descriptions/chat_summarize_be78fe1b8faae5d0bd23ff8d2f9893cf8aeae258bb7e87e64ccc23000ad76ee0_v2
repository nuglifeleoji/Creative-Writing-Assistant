Originally designed to hunt **Honored Matres**, the Futar are now kept caged and controlled by them, serving as threats or enforcers. They possess limited language skills, indicating a constrained intelligence, and are often deployed in interactions involving high-ranking Honored Matres, such as the **Great Honored Matre** and **Lucilla**.  \n\nRecently observed on **Gammu**, the Futar are described as fierce, animalistic beings, reflecting their engineered purpose as hunters. Despite their initial role as adversaries of the Honored Matres, they have been subjugated and repurposed by the same group they were meant to oppose. This reversal suggests either a failure in their original design or the Honored Matres' superior ability to dominate even engineered predators.  \n\nIn summary, the **Futar** are a manipulated species, caught between their origins as hunters and their current status as tools of the Honored Matres.
