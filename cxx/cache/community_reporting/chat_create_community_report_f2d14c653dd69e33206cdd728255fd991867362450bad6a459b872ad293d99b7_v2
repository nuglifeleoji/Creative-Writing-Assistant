Despite their involvement in such serious topics, many of them remain largely unaware of the broader concepts of war and national survival, often influenced by media portrayals that shape their understanding of the world.

During these events, they interact with holographic photos and engage in various forms of entertainment, although some express feelings of boredom despite the abundance of food and drink. Their participation in ceremonies, such as watching the raising of flags and signing important documents, highlights their role in the societal fabric, bridging the gap between tradition and the future.\n\nThe children aboard the 武藏号 are particularly notable for their involvement in military activities, such as shooting at seabirds and using military weapons, which reflects the harsh realities they face. They also play a crucial role in the economic recovery and agricultural production within their communities, showcasing their resilience and adaptability in times of crisis. Amidst a food crisis, these urban residents are depicted as struggling for survival, often searching for healthy adults in their environment, which underscores their vulnerability and the hope they cling to for a better future.\n\nThe children represent a new generation in both China and the United States, embodying the hopes and aspirations for change and progress.
