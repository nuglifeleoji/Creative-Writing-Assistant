A traditionalist deeply rooted in Fremen customs, he serves as a mentor, advisor, and loyal follower of Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib), guiding him in sandworm riding, tribal politics, and Fremen rituals. Stilgar initially welcomes Paul and Lady Jessica into his sietch, overseeing their integration into Fremen society and testing their authenticity during the Water of Life ceremony. As Paul’s Minister of State and a key leader of the Fedaykin, Stilgar plays a central role in battle planning, treaty negotiations, and upholding Fremen law, such as during Korba’s interrogation.  \n\nDespite his unwavering loyalty to the Atreides, Stilgar struggles with the empire’s transformation, often longing for the simplicity of desert life. He is conflicted over Alia’s rule, the twins Leto and Ghanima’s safety, and the erosion of Fremen traditions. His internal tensions manifest in moments of resistance—questioning Paul’s decisions, distrusting outsiders like the ghola, and even briefly contemplating rebellion. Yet, he remains a trusted protector, assigning guardians to Alia and later safeguarding Ghanima during unrest.  \n\nStilgar’s relationships are multifaceted: he is Chani’s uncle, Harah’s husband, and a moral guide to Leto II. His leadership blends authority with pragmatism, mediating conflicts (e.g., Paul vs. Jamis) and navigating neutrality amid political strife. Described as honorable yet superstitious, he embodies Fremen resilience, though Jessica notes his \"thin layer of civilization\" over primal instincts. By Leto II’s reign, Stilgar symbolizes the fading old ways, wary of the God Emperor’s radical changes.  \n\nIn summary, Stilgar is a complex leader—fervent in battle, devout in tradition, and torn between duty and dissent—whose legacy endures as both a pillar of Fremen culture and a reluctant architect of the Atreides empire.
