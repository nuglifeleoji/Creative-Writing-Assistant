As the Baron's chief strategist, De Vries played a critical role in Harkonnen schemes, leveraging his expertise in poisons and psychological manipulation. His most infamous creation, the residual poison, became a tool of controlâ€”later employed by the Baron to subjugate Thufir Hawat, the Duke Leto Atreides' former Mentat.  \n\nDe Vries met his end when Duke Leto, using a poison-capsule tooth, assassinated him during a confrontation. Despite his death, his legacy endured through the Baron's continued use of his residual poison. De Vries' contributions to Harkonnen machinations, particularly in the realm of biochemical coercion, solidified his reputation as a cunning and dangerous figure in the political landscape of the Imperium.
