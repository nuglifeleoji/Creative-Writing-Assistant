\n　　润叶真痛苦。她最近不愿回这个家，就是想躲避他们说这事。想不到她刚踏进家门，这就又来了。不过，这徐大爷一大把年纪，平时对她也好，再说又是二爸二妈的老人，她不能伤徐大爷的脸。她就很礼貌地说：“大爷，我知道你的好意，但我……” \n　　润叶急忙不知该怎么说。自少安找了山西姑娘开始，这已经一年多了，她慢慢恢复了一些正常。她真不愿意再把这伤口抓得血淋淋的。 \n　　徐国强看她还是原来的老样子，就只好把这件事背后的“那种意思”往明挑了！ \n　　他说：“你可能不知情，你二爸和向前他爸关系不怎么好。就是因为向前看上了你，这一年多来，他们的关系才缓和了一些。你还不知情，你二爸在这县上工作很困难，人家许多人合在一起整他！其中最关键的是向前他爸。因此上说，你如果和向前成了亲，你登云叔和你二爸就成了亲戚，他就再不好意思和你二爸作对了；那你二爸的日子也会好过一些……可是现在，登云一家人都对你这么热心，你要是拒绝了这门亲事，那后果我不说你也知道……唉，你二爸真是困难啊！”徐国强说完后，长长地叹了一口气。 \n　　润叶一下子被徐大爷的话震住了。天啊，她没想到，在这门亲事的后面还有这么严重的情况呢！ \n　　她一下子不知如何是好，脑子重新被搅得天昏地暗！ \n　　徐国强见她被他的话慑服了，并且陷入到深思之中，就说：“润叶，我先走了，你好好考虑一下。考虑好了，你就给大爷打一声招呼……” \n　　徐老引着黑猫退出了这孔窑洞——让娃娃一个人想想吧，这婚姻大事又不能逼迫！ \n　　徐国强出了门以后，润叶还手里抱着自己的棉大衣呆立在脚地上。 \n　　啊啊！事情原来这么严重！她早就觉得二爸情绪一直不好，原来有这么多人都反对他哩！而且作对的主要是向前他爸！ \n　　这可叫她怎么办呢？在她的心中，她最尊敬和爱戴的就是二爸。他爱护她，供她上学，又给她找了工作。平时，就是买一毛钱的水果糖，也是给她和晓霞各分一半……现在，他竟然有这么大的困难！她心疼二爸。她愿意为他分担忧患。可是，她又并不爱李向前啊！ \n　　她内心又象狂风暴雨一般翻腾起来。她想：让她和向前结婚，这大概也是二爸的意思！他不好给她说，只好让徐大爷出面给她做工作……怎么办？她不断问自己。 \n　　一个她说：不能答应这门亲事！因为你不爱向前！你爱的人是孙少安！\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>润叶<|>PERSON<|>润叶 is a character who is facing pressure regarding
