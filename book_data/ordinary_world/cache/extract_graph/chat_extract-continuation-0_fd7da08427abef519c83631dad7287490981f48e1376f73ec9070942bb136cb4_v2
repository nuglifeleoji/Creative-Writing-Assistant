\n　　阎生华走后，田福军想笑，又笑不出来，反而陷入了长久的深思之中。是呀，这个地区经济文化的落后，造成了人的意识的落后。瞧，我们的生华同志竟然把精神文明”搞到了何种程度！黄原，需要现代文明的大冲击——但这只能在经济大发展的基础上发生。唉，如果铁路能通到这里就好了。铁路的到来，必然会使这里的经济极大地发展起来，随之也会把外面各种新鲜的思想，观念和生活方式带进来，虽然可能要付出丧失某些优良传统的代价，但黄原历史前进的步伐将无疑会大大地加快……铁路！铁路！这次去北京搞这个汇报会，哪怕其它方面一无所获，只要能争得中央和省上的支持，把铁路从铜城修到黄原就是最大的收获了！这不是他田福军一个人的梦想，而是全区一百多万人民的梦想……在地区的人马准备向首都进发的时候，北京那里诸方面的工作也接近就绪了。 \n　　十多天里，冯世宽带着地委行署的两个秘书长，以及地区经委、计委和财政局的负责人，以省驻京办事处为大本营，中纪委常委高步杰为总顾问，没明没黑为汇报会的召开而奔波…… \n　　实在可以这样说：如果没有高老的帮助和支持，这个汇报会也许开不出什么样子；甚至开成开不成都很难说。 \n　　冯世宽一到北京，就首先带着黄原来的所有干部集体拜见了高老。我们知道，高老和世宽也是熟人了。那年老汉回家乡时，曾经批评过原西的工作——那时正是世宽当县革委会主任。老头对此事记忆犹新，不过倒没对世宽本人产生什么隔阂。尤其是此次世宽作为急先锋赶来北京为黄原的建设奔忙，高老更是全力以赴帮助他做工作。 \n　　高老不愧为高老；他经验丰富，熟人又多，大部分事情很快就被处理的妥妥贴贴。 \n　　高老首先用政治智慧，把此次活动正式定名为“振兴黄原经济汇报会”。接下来，他让冯世宽等人以黄原地委和行署的名义，给中央写了个报告——因为在人民大会堂开会需要中共中央办公厅批准。 \n　　等冯世宽写好报告，高老就去了一趟中南海，亲手将报告送给他的老战友、籍贯是本省中部平原的一位中共中央政治局委员。这位政治局委员二话没说，立刻指示同意，并请另一位中共中央政治局委员，也就是前不久去黄原视察过工作的那位国务院副总理出席。同时，会议定在人民大会堂西大厅举行。 \n　　最主要的事定下后，冯世宽这才松了几口。他用长途电话向田福军和呼正文作了汇报。
