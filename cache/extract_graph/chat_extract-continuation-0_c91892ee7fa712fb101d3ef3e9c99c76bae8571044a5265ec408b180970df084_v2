Each is planted most tenderly in its own little pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns them white. You can see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high place. White reflects. But when Old Father Sun departs, the chromoplastic reverts to transparency in the dark. It cools with extreme rapidity. The surface condenses moisture out of the air. That moisture trickles down to keep our plants alive.”\n“Dew collectors,” he muttered, enchanted by the simple beauty of such a scheme.\n“FIL mourn Jamis in the proper time for it,” she said, aS though her mind had not left his other question. “He was a good man, Jamis, but quick to anger. A good provider, Jamis, and a wonder with the children. He made no separation between Geoff’s boy, my firstborn, and his own true son. They were equal in his eyes.” She turned a questing stare on Paul. “Would it be that way with you, Usul?”\n“We don’t have that problem.”\n“But if—”\n“Harah!”\nShe recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice.\nThey passed another brightly lighted room visible through an arch on their left. “What’s made there?” he asked.\n“They repair the weaving machinery,” she said. “But it must be dismantled by tonight.” She gestured at a tunnel branching to their left. “Through there and beyond, that’s food processing and stillsuit maintenance.” She looked at Paul. “Your suit looks new. But if it needs work, I’m good with suits. | work in the factory in season.”\nThey began coming on knots of people now and thicker clusterings of openings in the tunnel’s sides. A file of men and women passed them carrying packs that gurgled heavily, the smell of spice strong about them.\n“They'll not get our water,” Harah said. “Or our Spice. You can be sure of that.”\nPaul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled cushions. People in the openings fell silent at their approach, followed Paul with untamed stares.\n“The people find it strange you bested Jamis,” Harah said. “Likely you’ll have some proving to do when we're settled in a new sietch.”\n“I don’t like killing,” he said.\n“Thus Stilgar tells it,” she said, but her voice betrayed her disbelief.\nA shrill chanting grew louder ahead of them. They came to another side opening wider than any of the others Paul had seen. He slowed his pace, staring in at a room crowded with children sitting cross-legged on a maroon-carpeted floor.\nAt a chalkboard against the far wall stood a woman in a yellow wraparound, a projecto-stylus in one hand. The board was filled with designs—circles, wedges and curves, snake tracks and squares, flowing arcs split by parallel lines. The woman pointed to the designs one after the other as fast as She could move the stylus, and the children chanted in rhythm with her moving hand.\nPaul listened, hearing the voices grow dimmer behind as he moved deeper into the sietch with Harah.\n“Tree,” the children chanted. “Tree, grass, dune, wind, mountain, hill, fire, lightning, rock, rocks, dust, sand, heat, shelter, heat, full, winter, cold, empty, erosion, summer, cavern, day, tension, moon, night, caprock, sandtide, slope, planting, binder....”\n“You conduct classes at a time like this?” Paul asked.\nHer face went somber and grief edged her voice: “What Liet taught us, we cannot pause an instant in that. Liet who is dead must not be forgotten. It’s the Chakobsa way.”\nShe crossed the tunnel to the left, stepped up onto a ledge, parted gauzy orange hangings and stood aside: “Your yali is ready for you, Usul.”\nPaul hesitated before joining her on the ledge. He felt a sudden reluctance to be alone with this woman. It came to him that he was surrounded by a way of life that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and values. He felt that this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare him in its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare—the wild jihad, the religious war he felt he should avoid at any cost.\n“This is your yali,” Harah said. “Why do you hesitate?”\nPaul nodded, joined her on the ledge. He lifted the hangings across from her, feeling metal fibers in the fabric, followed her into a short entrance way and then into a larger room, square, about six meters to a side—thick blue carpets on the floor, blue and green fabrics hiding the rock walls, glowglobes tuned to yellow overhead bobbing against draped yellow ceiling fabrics.\nThe effect was that of an ancient tent.\nHarah stood in front of him, left hand on hip, her eyes studying his face. “The children are with a\nfriend,” she said. “They will present themselves later.”\nPaul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room. Thin hangings to the right, he saw, partly concealed a larger room with cushions piled around the walls. He felt a soft breeze from an air duct, saw the outlet cunningly hidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead of him.\n“Do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit?” Harah asked.\n“No...thank you.”\n“Shall | bring food?”\n“Yes.”\n“There is a reclamation chamber off the other room.” She gestured. “For your comfort and convenience when you’re out of your stillsuit.”\n“You said we have to leave this sietch,” Paul said. “Shouldn't we be packing or something?”\n“It will be done in its time,” she said. “The butchers have yet to penetrate to our region.”\nStill she hesitated, staring at him.\n“What is it?” he demanded.\n“You've not the eyes of the Ibad,” she said. “It’s strange but not entirely unattractive.”\n“Get the food,” he said. “I’m hungry.”\nShe smiled at him—a knowing, woman’s smile that he found disquieting. “I am your servant,” she said, and whirled away in one lithe motion, ducking behind a heavy wall hanging that revealed another passage before falling back into place.\nFeeling angry with himself, Paul brushed through the thin hanging on the right and into the larger\nroom. He stood there a moment caught by uncertainty. And he wondered where Chani was... Chani who had just lost her father.\nWe're alike in that, he thought.\nA wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors, its volume muffled by the intervening hangings. It was repeated, a bit more distant. And again. Paul realized someone was calling the time. He focused on the fact that he had seen no clocks.\nThe faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils, riding on the omnipresent stink of the sietch. Paul saw that he had already suppressed the odorous assault on his senses.\nAnd he wondered again about his mother, how the moving montage of the future would incorporate her...and the daughter she bore. Mutable time- awareness danced around him. He shook his head Sharply, focusing his attention on the evidences that spoke of profound depth and breadth in this Fremen culture that had swallowed them.\nWith its subtle oddities.\nHe had seen a thing about the caverns and this room, a thing that suggested far greater differences than anything he had yet encountered.\nThere was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use anywhere in the cave warren. Yet he could smell poisons in the sietch stench— strong ones, common ones.\nHe heard a rustle of hangings, thought it was Harah returning with food, and turned to watch her. Instead, from beneath a displaced pattern of hangings, he saw two young boys—perhaps aged\nnine and ten—staring out at him with greedy eyes. Each wore a small kindjal-type of crysknife, rested a hand on the hilt.\nAnd Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen—that their children fought as ferociously as the adults.\nThe hands move, the lips move— Ideas gush from his words,\nAnd his eyes devour!\nHe is an island of Selfdom.\n—DESCRIPTION FROM “A MANUAL OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhosphor tubes in the faraway upper reaches of\nthe cavern cast a dim light onto the thronged interior, hinting at the great size of this rock-enclosed Space...larger, Jessica saw, than even the Gathering Hall of her Bene Gesserit school. She estimated there were more than five thousand people gathered out there beneath the ledge where she stood with Stilgar.\nAnd more were coming.\nThe air was murmurous with people.\n“Your son has been summoned from his rest, Sayyadina,” Stilgar said. “Do you wish him to share in your decision?”\n“Could he change my decision?”\n“Certainly, the air with which you speak comes from your own lungs, but—”\n“The decision stands,” she said.\nBut she felt misgivings, wondering if she should use Paul as an excuse for backing out of a dangerous course. There was an unborn daughter to think of as well. What endangered the flesh of the mother endangered the flesh of the daughter.\nMen came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them, stirring up dust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge.\nStilgar took her arm, led her back into the acoustical horn that formed the rear limits of the ledge. He indicated a rock bench within the horn. “The Reverend Mother will sit here, but you may rest yourself until she comes.”\n“| prefer to stand,” Jessica said.\nShe watched the men unroll the carpets, covering the ledge, looked out at the crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor now.\nAnd still they came.\nOut on the desert, she knew, it already was red nightfall, but here in the cavern hall was perpetual twilight, a gray vastness thronged with people come to see her risk her life.\nA way was opened through the crowd to her right, and she saw Paul approaching flanked by two small boys. There was a swaggering air of self-importance about the children. They kept hands on knives, scowled at the wall of people on either side.\n“The sons of Jamis who are now the sons of Usul,” Stilgar said. “They take their escort duties seriously.” He ventured a smile at Jessica.\nJessica recognized the effort to lighten her mood and was grateful for it, but could not take her mind from the danger that confronted her.\n| had no choice but to do this, she thought.
