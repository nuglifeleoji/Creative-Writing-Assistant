为了避免前面花钱太多以至于影响到后面的旅行，南澄和蓝潇商量之后，就决定最后一天再大采购。\n\n    联邦的物价非常稳定，不存在不同星球有着巨大差价从而被人牟利的情况。所以对于这种跨星球的购买，并没什么限制。\n\n    天斗购物是一家大型连锁商场，遍布于天斗星各大城市之中。\n\n    无疑，在天斗城的总店乃是规模最大的一个。以至于南澄在来到这里，看到商场巨大的面积就后悔没有多留一些时间给自己购物了。\n\n    女人购物其实并不一定非要给自己买东西，最重要的是购买过程中的快感。\n\n    一会儿给蓝轩宇买身新衣服，一会儿给蓝潇买双鞋子。南澄给自己买的东西倒是很少。\n\n    “老公，你看这个怎么样？护身符哦。说是精神控制大师清光寒的作品呢。可以让你时刻保持清醒。你要出远门，带着它比较好，有利于你工作。虽然贵了点，但咱们还是买了吧。”南澄看着面前橱窗中一颗用蓝水晶雕琢而成的挂件向身边的蓝潇说道。\n\n    “你同意我去了？”蓝潇有些惊讶的看着她。\n\n    南澄瞥了他一眼，“虽然舍不得。可你明明那么有本事，这些年升职的速度却那么慢。你自己虽然不说，但我能感觉得到，在工作上其实你并不是那么开心的。你需要更大的舞台。我能不支持你吗？我只有一个要求，无论如何，平平安安回来。其实，我只是希望，咱们一家能够平安快乐的生活在一起就足够了。”\n\n    蓝潇眼中闪过一抹感动，握住她的手，道：“要不，我还是……”\n\n    南澄抬手捂住他的嘴，“好啦，别说这些。我能感觉得到，你是想去的。去吧，不就是最多半年么，我们在家等着你。”\n\n    “嗯。”蓝潇深吸口气，眼中闪过一抹坚定之色，他绝不会让妻子失望的，这次，一定要作出一些成绩来，不能再高傲，更不能懒散。\n\n    “那护身符买了，这可是对你安全的保障。服务员，麻烦你，这个护身符我要了。给我结账吧。轩宇，你在这儿跟爸爸等着妈妈……，咦，轩宇呢？”\n------------\n\n第三十二章 再遇娜娜\n\n    南澄正准备去结账，可低头一看，先前还在他们身边的蓝轩宇却不见了。\n\n    蓝潇笑道：“没事儿，丢不了，你去结账，我找他去。”\n\n    这种先进的大卖场都有非常完善的监控设备，丢孩子这种情况是根本不可能存在的。肯定是蓝轩宇贪玩儿，不知道跑到什么地方去了。\n\n    蓝轩宇确实是有些贪玩儿，他这会儿正站在一个卖手办的店里，看着一个特别漂亮的手办，小脸上满是�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
