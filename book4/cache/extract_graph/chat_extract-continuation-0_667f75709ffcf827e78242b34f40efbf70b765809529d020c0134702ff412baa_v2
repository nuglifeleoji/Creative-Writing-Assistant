\n　　但这个身体略嫌发胖的青年，心肠倒并不坏。他不象他这个行道的有些青年，动不动打架生事，或者时不时在公路上演出一些恶作剧来。李向前本质上是个本份人。他只是在吃、穿、住和开汽车这几个范围内兢兢业业而又精精明明地奔波操劳，其它范围的事他没什么兴趣。 \n　　但是，这一切方面所用的心思加起来再乘以二，也抵不上他对田润叶所用的心思。这没有办法，一个男人一旦迷上了一个女人，就觉得这女人是他的生命，他的太阳。除过这个女人，世界上所有的女人都暗淡失色了。为了得到这女人的爱，他可以付出令人难以想象的牺牲。甚至得到的不是爱，而是鄙视和污辱，心里也很难为此而悔恨自己。正如两句信天游唱的—— \n　　我爱我的干妹妹，狼吃了我也不后悔……经过很长时间的不屈不挠的追求，李向前终于如愿以偿地和润叶结了婚。就象当年他终于开上了汽车一样，他觉得这又是把一个美梦变成了现实。 \n　　他是多么爱她啊！她身上的一切在他看来都是完善无缺的，简直可以说是个天仙。 \n　　但这位“天仙”虽然已经和他同宿一房，可好象仍然还在天上。现实又无情地变成了一个美梦——他不能把自己所爱的人搂进自己的怀抱！ \n　　当他耐下心安分守己地睡在床上好多天以后，他的妻子还没有“克服羞怯”，仍然独个儿睡在墙角的小床上不理他。李向前苦恼得实在没办法了。 \n　　他突然想：干脆让我离家一段时间，让润叶一个人呆着。在她这段独处的时间里，也许就会开始想念他，盼他回来。当他再返回家时，不要他去找她，她自己说不定就会迫不及待地扑入他的怀抱。 \n　　这个带有浪漫色彩的想法，使李向前很兴奋。就象要实行一个精心的计划一样，他打点了一点行装，找了个借口，就一个人走了北京。他父母直到现在，也并不太清楚自己儿子的不幸，只是觉得儿子新婚不久，就一个人去外地出差，多少有些不合情理。他们曾劝说他把润叶也一块带上去玩；但向前说他妻子身体不舒服，就不一块去了……李向前到了北京以后，找了个旅馆住下。他也没开车，又没什么具体事，几乎完全是要白白地熬过一段时光。他就象自己给自己判了个有期徒刑，在这里屈指计算着刑满释放的那一天到来。日子过得多么平静，什么事情都没有。可他的心如火焚，如油煎，真的就象一个囚犯坐牢一般难熬，白天，他拿着一张\n######################\nOutput:",
