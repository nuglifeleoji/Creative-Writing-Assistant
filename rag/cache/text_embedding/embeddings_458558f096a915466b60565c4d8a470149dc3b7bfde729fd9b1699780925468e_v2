That was why this rushing around and the Suk.\nBut who were all those others? Bene Gesserit robes in an abundance he had never before seen here. Not just acolytes. Reverend Mothers outnumbered the others he saw rushing about down there. They reminded him of great carrion birds. There went an acolyte at last, carrying a child on her shoulders. Very mysterious. /f only | had a link to Shipsystems!\nHe leaned against a wall and waited but the people vanished into various hatches and doorways. Some destinations he could place with fair certainty, others remained a mystery.\nBy the Holy Prophet! There went Mother Superior herself! She went through a wider doorway where most of the others\nhad gone.\nUseless to ask Odrade when next he saw her. She had him in her trap now.\nThe Prophet is here and in powindah hands!\nWhen no more people appeared in the corridor, Scytale returned to his quarters. The Identification monitor at his doorway flickered at his passage but he forced himself not to look at it. /D is the key. With his knowledge, this flaw in the Ixian ship’s control system beckoned like a siren.\nWhen | move, they will not give me much time.\nIt would be an act of desperation with ship and contents hostage. Seconds in which to succeed. Who knew what false panels might have been built, what secret hatches where those awful women could leap out at him. He dared not gamble before exhausting all other avenues. Especially now ... with the Prophet restored.\nTricky witches. What else did they change in this ship? A disquieting thought. Does my knowledge still apply?\nThe presence of Scytale beyond the barrier had not escaped Odrade’s notice but she had other matters to concern her. Murbella’s accouchement (she liked the ancient term) had come at an opportune moment. Odrade wanted a distracted Idaho with her for Sheeana’s attempt at restoring the Bashar’s memories. Idaho was often distracted by thoughts of Murbella. And Murbella obviously could not be with him here, not just now.\nOdrade maintained prudent watchfulness in his presence. He was, after all, a Mentat.\nShe had found him at his console again. As she emerged from the dropchute into the access corridor to his quarters, she heard the clicking of relays and that characteristic buzzing of the comfield and knew immediately where to find him.\nHe revealed an odd mood when she took him into the observation room where they would monitor Sheeana and the child.\nWorry about Murbella? Or about what they would presently see?\nThe observation room was long and narrow. Three rows of chairs faced the seewall common with the secret room where the experiment would occur. The observation area had been left in gray gloom with only two tiny glowglobes at upper corners behind the chairs.\nTwo Suks were present . . . although Odrade worried that they might be ineffective. Jalanto, the Suk Idaho considered their best, was with Murbella.\nDemonstrate our concern. It’s real enough.\nSlingchairs had been set up along the seewall. An emergency access hatch into the other room was near at hand.\nStreggi brought the child down the outer passage where he would not see the watchers and took him into the room. It had been prepared under Murbella’s directions: a bedroom, some of his own things brought from his quarters and some things from the rooms shared by Idaho and Murbella.\nAn animal’s cave, Odrade thought. There was a Shabbiness about the place that came from the deliberate disarray often found in Idaho’s chambers: discarded clothing on a slingchair, sandals in a corner. The sleeping mat was one Idaho and Murbella had used. Inspecting it earlier, Odrade had noted that smell akin to saliva, an intimate sexual odor. That, too, would work unconsciously on Teg.\nHere is where the wild things originate, the things we cannot suppress. What daring, to think we can control this. But we must.\nAs Streggi undressed the boy and left him naked on the mat, Odrade found her pulse quickening. She shifted her chair forward, noticing her Bene Gesserit companions imitate the same hitching motion.\nDear me, she thought. Are we nothing but voyeurs?\nSuch thoughts were necessary at this moment but she felt them demean her. She lost something in that intrusion. Extremely non-Bene Gesserit thinking. But very human!\nDuncan had lapsed into a studied air of indifference, an easily recognized pretense. Too much subjectivity in his thoughts for him to function well as a Mentat. And that was precisely how she wanted him now. Participation Mystique. Orgasm as energizer. Bell had recognized it correctly.\nTo one of three nearby Proctors, all chosen for strength and here ostensibly as observers, Odrade said: “The ghola wants his original memories restored and fears that utterly. That’s the major barrier to be sundered.”\n“Bullcrap!” Idaho said. “You know what we have working for us right now? His mother was one of you and she gave him the deep training. How likely is it she failed to protect him against your Imprinters?”\nOdrade turned sharply toward him. Mentat? No, he was back in his immediate past, reliving and making comparisons. That reference to Imprinters, though... Was that how the first “sexual collision” with Murbella restored memories of other ghola-lifetimes? Deep resistance against imprinting?\nThe Proctor Odrade had addressed chose to ignore this impertinent interruption. She had read the Archives material when Bellonda briefed her. All three of them knew they might be called on to kill the ghola-child. Did he have powers dangerous to them? The watchers would not know until (or unless) Sheeana succeeded.\nTo Idaho, Odrade said: “Streggi told him why he is here.”\n“What did she tell him?” Very peremptory with Mother Superior. The Proctors glared at him.\nOdrade held her voice to deliberate mildness. “Streggi told him Sheeana would restore his memories.”\n“What did he say?”\n“Why isn’t Duncan Idaho doing it?”\n“She answered him honestly?” Getting some of his own back.\n“Honestly but revealing nothing. Streggi told him Sheeana had a better way. And that you approved.”\n“Look at him! He isn’t even moving. You haven’t drugged him, have you?”\nIdaho glared back at the Proctors.\n“We wouldn’t dare. But he is focused inward. You do recall the necessity for that, don’t you?”\nIdaho sank back into his chair, shoulders slumping. “Murbella keeps saying: ‘He’s just a child. He’s just a child.’ You know we had a fight over it.”\n“I thought your argument pertinent. The Bashar was not a child. It’s the Bashar we're awakening.”\nHe raised crossed fingers. “I hope.”\nShe drew back, looking at the crossed fingers. “I didn’t know you were superstitious, Duncan.”\n“I’d pray to Dur if | thought it would help.”\nHe remembers his own re-awakening pains.\n“Don’t reveal compassion,” he muttered. “Turn it back on him. Keep him focused inward. You want his anger.”\nThose were words from his own practique.\nAbruptly, he said: “This may be the stupidest thing | ever suggested. | should go and be with Murbella.”\n“You're in good company, Duncan. And there’s nothing you can do for Murbella right now. Look!” As Teg leaped off the mat and stared up at the ceiling comeyes.\n“Isn't someone coming to help me?” Teg demanded. More desperation in his voice than predicted for this stage. “Where’s Duncan Idaho?”\nOdrade put a hand on Idaho’s arm as he hitched forward. “Stay where you are, Duncan. You can’t help him, either. Not yet.”\n“Isn't someone going to tell me what to do?” The young voice had a lonely, piping sound. “What're you going to do?”\nSheeana’s cue and she entered the room through a hidden hatch behind Teg. “Here | am.” She wore only a gossamer robe of pale blue, almost transparent. It clung to her as she strode around to face the boy.\nHe gawked. This was a Reverend Mother? He had never seen one robed that way. “You’re going to give me back my memories?” Doubt and desperation.\n“I will help you give them back to yourself.” As she spoke, she slipped out of the robe and tossed it aside. It floated to the floor like a great blue butterfly.\nTeg stared at her. “What're you doing?”\n“What do you think I’m doing?” She sat down beside him and put a hand on his penis.\nHis head tipped forward as though pushed from behind and he stared at her hand as an erection formed in it.\n“Why’re you doing that?”\n“Don’t you know?”\n“No!”\n“The Bashar would know.”\nHe looked up at her face so close to his. “You know! Why won't you tell me?”\n“I’m not your memory!”\n“Why’re you humming like that?”\nShe put her lips against his neck. The humming was clear to the watchers. Murbella called it an intensifier, feedback keyed to the sexual response. It grew louder.\n“What’re you doing?” Almost a shriek as she sat him astraddle of her. She swayed, massaging the small of his back.\n“Answer me, damn you!” A definite shriek.\nWhere did that “damn you!” come from? Odrade wondered.\nSheeana slipped him into her. “Here’s your answer!”\nHis mouth formed a soundless “Ohhhhhhhhh.”\nThe watchers saw her concentration on Teg’s eyes but Sheeana watched him with other senses as well.\n“Feel the tensing of his thighs, the telltale vagus pulse and especially note the darkening of his nipples. When you have him at that point, sustain it until his pupils dilate.”\n“Imprinter!” Teg’s scream made the watchers jump.\nHe beat his fists against Sheeana’s shoulders. All of them at the seewall observed an inner flickering of his eyes as he twisted back and forth, something new peering out of him.\nOdrade was on her feet. “Has something gone wrong?”\nIdaho remained in his chair. “What | predicted.”\nSheeana thrust Teg away to escape his clawing fingers.\nHe sprawled to the floor and whirled with a speed that shocked the watchers. Sheeana and Teg confronted each other for several long heartbeats. Slowly, he straightened and only then did he look down at himself. Presently, he lifted his attention to his left arm held in front of him. His gaze went to the ceiling, to each wall in turn. Again, he looked at his body.\n“What in the nether hell . . .” Still childish piping but oddly matured.\n“Welcome, ghola-Bashar,” Sheeana said.\n“You were trying to imprint me!” Angry accusation. “You think my mother didn’t teach me how to prevent that?” A distant expression came over his face. “Ghola?”\n“Some prefer to think of you as a clone.”\n“Who’re ...Sheeana!” He whirled, looking all around the room. It had been selected for its concealed access, no visible hatches. “Where are we?”\n“In the no-ship you took to Dune just before you were killed there", " confronted each other for several long heartbeats. Slowly, he straightened and only then did he look down at himself. Presently, he lifted his attention to his left arm held in front of him. His gaze went to the ceiling, to each wall in turn. Again, he looked at his body.\n“What in the nether hell . . .” Still childish piping but oddly matured.\n“Welcome, ghola-Bashar,” Sheeana said.\n“You were trying to imprint me!” Angry accusation. “You think my mother didn’t teach me how to prevent that?” A distant expression came over his face. “Ghola?”\n“Some prefer to think of you as a clone.”\n“Who’re ...Sheeana!” He whirled, looking all around the room. It had been selected for its concealed access, no visible hatches. “Where are we?”\n“In the no-ship you took to Dune just before you were killed there.” Still according to the rules.\n“Killed...” Again, he looked at his hands. Watchers could almost see ghola-imposed filters drop from his memories. “l was killed .. . on Dune?” Almost plaintive.\n“Heroic to the end,” Sheeana said.\n“My ...the men I took from Gammu... were they...”\n“Honored Matres made an example of Dune. It’s a lifeless ball, charred to cinders.”\nAnger touched his features. He sat and crossed his legs, placing a clenched fist on each knee. “Yes ...1 learned that in the history of the... of me.” Again, he glanced at Sheeana. She remained seated on the mat, quite still. This was such a plunge into memories as only one who had been through the Agony could appreciate. Utter stillness was required now.\nOdrade whispered: “Don’t interfere, Sheeana. Let it happen. Let him work it out.” She made a hand-signal to the three Proctors. They went to the access hatch, watching her instead of the secret room.\n“I find it odd to consider myself a subject of history,” Teg said. The child’s voice but that recurring sense of maturity in it. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply.\nIn the observation room, Odrade sank back into her chair and asked: “What did you see, Duncan?”\n“When Sheeana pushed him away from her, he turned with a swiftness | have never seen except in Murbella.”\n“Faster even than that.”\n“Perhaps... it's because his body is young and we have given him prana-bindu training.”\n“Something else. You alerted us, Duncan. An unknown in Atreides marker cells.” She glanced at the watchful Proctors and shook her head. No. Not yet. “Damn that mother of his! Hypno-induction to block an Imprinter and she hid it from us.”\n“But look what she gave us,” Idaho said. “A more effective way to restore memories.”\n“We should have seen that on our own!” Odrade felt anger at herself. “Scytale claims Tleilaxu used pain and confrontation. | wonder.”\n“Ask him.”\n“It’s not that simple. Our Truthsayers are not certain of him.”\n“He iS opaque.”\n“When have you studied him?”\n“Dar! | have access to comeye records.”\n“I know, but...”\n“Dammit! Will you keep your eyes on Teg? Look at him! What’s happening?”\nOdrade snapped her attention to the seated child.\nTeg looked at the comeyes, an expression of terrible intensity on his face.\nIt had been for him like awakening from sleep in the stress of conflict, an aide’s hand shaking him. Something needed his attention! He recalled sitting in the no-ship’s command center, Dar standing beside him with a hand on his neck. Scratching him? Something urgent to do. What? His body felt wrong. Gammu... and now they were on Dune and...He remembered different things: childhood on Chapterhouse? Dar as...as...More memories meshed. They tried to imprint me!\nAwareness flowed around this thought like a river spreading itself for a rock.\n“Dar! Are you there? You’re there!”\nOdrade sat back and put a hand to her chin. What now?\n“Mother!” What an accusatory tone!\nOdrade touched a transplate beside her chair. “Hello, Miles. Shall we go for a walk in the orchards?”\n“No more games, Dar. | know why you need me. | warn you, though: Violence projects the wrong kinds of people into power. As if you didn’t know!”\n“Still loyal to the Sisterhood, Miles, in spite of what we just tried?”\nHe glanced at the watchful Sheeana. “Still your obedient dog.”\nOdrade shot an accusatory look at the smiling Idaho. “You and your damned stories!”\n“All right, Miles—no more games but I have to know about Gammu. They say you moved faster than the eye could follow.”\n“True.” Flat, what-the-hell tone.\n“And just now...”\n“This body’s too small to carry the load.”\n“But you...”\n“I used it up in just one burst and I’m starving.”\nOdrade glanced at Idaho. He nodded. Truth.\nShe motioned the Proctors back from the hatch. They hesitated before obeying. What had Bell told them?\nTeg was not through. “Do | have it right, daughter? Since every individual is accountable ultimately to the self, formation of that self demands the utmost care and attention?”\nThat damned mother of his taught him everything!\n“| apologize, Miles. We did not know how your mother prepared you.”\n“Whose idea was it?” He looked at Sheeana as he spoke.\n“My idea, Miles,” Idaho said.\n“Oh, you’re there, too?” More memory trickled back.\n“And | recall the pain you caused me when you restored my memories,” Idaho said.\nThat sobered him. “Point taken, Duncan. No apology needed.” He looked at the speakers relaying their voices. “How’s the air at the top, Dar? Rarefied enough for you?”\nDamned silly idea! she thought. And he knows it. Not rarefied at all. The air was thick with the breathing of those around her, including ones wanting to share her dramatic presence, ones with ideas (sometimes the idea they would be better at her job), ones with offering hands and demanding hands. Rarefied, indeed! She sensed that Teg was trying to tell her something. What?\n“Sometimes | must be the autocrat!”\nShe heard herself saying this to him during one of their orchard walks, explaining “autocrat” to him and adding: “/ have the power and must use it. That drags on me terribly.”\nYou have the power, so use it! That was what this Mentat Bashar was telling her. Ki// me or release me, Dar.\nStill, she stalled for time and knew he would sense it. “Miles, Burzmali’s dead, but he kept a reserve force here he trained himself. The best of—”\n“Don’t bother me with petty details!” What a voice of command! Thin and reedy but all other essentials there.\nWithout being told, the Proctors returned to the hatch. Odrade waved them away with an angry gesture. Only then did she realize that she had reached a decision.\n“Give him back his clothes and bring him out,” she said. “Get Streggi in here.”\nTeg’s first words on emerging alarmed Odrade and made her wonder if she had made a mistake.\n“What if | will not do battle the way you want?”\n“But you said...”\n“I’ve said many things in my... lives. Battle doesn’t reinforce moral sense, Dar.”\nShe (and Taraza) had heard the Bashar on that subject more than once. “Warfare leaves a residue of ‘eat drink and be merry’ that often leads inexorably to moral breakdown.”\nCorrect but she did not know what he had in mind with his reminder. “For every veteran who returns with a new sense of destiny (‘I survived; that must be God’s purpose’) more come home with barely submerged bitterness, ready to take ‘the easy way’ because they saw so much of it in the stresses of war.”\nThey were Teg’s words but her belief.\nStreggi hurried into the room but before she could speak, Odrade motioned her to stand aside and wait silently.\nFor once, the acolyte had the courage to disobey Mother Superior.\n“Duncan should know he has another daughter. Mother and child live and are healthy.” She looked at Teg. “Hello, Miles.” Only then did Streggi remove herself to the rear wall and stand quietly.\nShe is better than | hoped, Odrade thought.\nIdaho relaxed into his chair, feeling now the tensions of worry that had interfered with his appreciation of what he had observed here.\nTeg nodded to Streggi but spoke to Odrade: “Any more words to whisper in God’s ear?” It was essential to control their attention and count on Odrade recognizing it. “If not, I’m really famished.”\nOdrade raised a finger to signal Streggi and heard the acolyte leave.\nShe sensed where Teg was directing her attention and, sure enough, he said: “Perhaps you've really created a scar this time.”\nA barb directed at the Sisterhood’s boast that “We don’t let scars accumulate on our pasts. Scars often conceal more than they reveal.”\n“Some scars revea/ more than they conceal,” he said. He looked at Idaho. “Right, Duncan?” One Mentat to another.\n“I believe I’ve come in on an old argument,” Idaho said.\nTeg looked at Odrade. “See, daughter? A Mentat knows old argument when he hears it. You pride yourselves on knowing what’s required of you at every turn, but the monster at this turning is one of your own making!”\n“Mother Superior!” That was a Proctor who did not want her addressed thus.\nOdrade ignored her. She felt chagrin, harsh and compelling. Taraza Within remembered the dispute: “We are shaped by Bene Gesserit associations. In peculiar ways, they blunt us. Oh, we cut swift and deep when we must, but that’s another kind of blunting.”\n“lII not take part in blunting you,” Teg said. So he remembered.\nStreggi returned with a bowl of stew, brown broth with meat floating in it. Teg sat on the floor and spooned it into his mouth with urgent motions.\nOdrade remained silent, her thoughts moving where Teg had sent them. There was a hard shell Reverend Mothers\nput around themselves against which all things from outside (including emotions) played like projections. Murbella was right and the Sisterhood had to relearn emotions. If they were only observers, they were doomed.\nShe addressed Teg. “You won’t be asked to blunt us.”\nBoth Teg and Idaho heard something else in her voice. Teg put aside his empty bowl but Idaho was first to speak. “Cultivated,” he said.\nTeg agreed. Sisters were seldom impulsive. You got ordered reactions from them even in times of peril. They went beyond what most people thought of as cultivated. They were driven not so much by dreams of power as by their own long view, a thing compounded by immediacy and almost unlimited memory. So Odrade was following a carefully thought out plan. Teg glanced at the watchful Proctors.\n“You were prepared to kill me,” he said.\nNo one answered. There was no need. They all recognized Mentat Projection.\nTeg turned and looked back into the room where he had regained his", " like projections. Murbella was right and the Sisterhood had to relearn emotions.

They would speak in their own time. This diminutive body. That was difficult. And Streggi .. . He focused on Odrade. “You were more clever than you thought. But my mother...”\n“| don’t think she anticipated this,” Odrade said.\n“No ...she was not that much Atreides.”\nAn electrifying word in these circumstances, it charged a special silence in the room. The Proctors moved closer.\nThat mother of his!\nTeg ignored the hovering Proctors. “In answer to the questions you have not asked, | cannot explain what happened to me on Gammu. My physical and mental speed defies explanation. Given the size and energy, in one of your heartbeats | could be clear of this room and well on my way out of the ship. Ohhh...” Hand upraised. “I’m still your\nobedient dog. l'Il do what you require, but perhaps not in the way you imagine.”\nOdrade saw consternation in the faces of her Sisters. What have I loosed upon us?\n“We can prevent any living thing from leaving this ship,” she said. “You may be fast but | doubt you are faster than the fire that would engulf you should you try to leave without our permission.”\n“I will leave in my own good time and with your permission. How many of Burzmali’s special troops do you have?”\n“Almost two million.” Startled out of her.\n“So many!”\n“He had more than twice that number with him at Lampadas when Honored Matres obliterated them.”\n“We shall have to be more clever than poor Burzmali. Would you leave me to discuss this with Duncan? That is why you keep us around, isn’t it? Our specialty?” He aimed a smiling look at the overhead comeyes. “I’m sure you'll review our discussion thoroughly before approving.”\nOdrade and her Sisters exchanged glances. They shared an unspoken question: What else can we do?\nAs she stood, Odrade looked at Idaho. “Here’s a real job for a Truthsayer-Mentat!”\nWhen the women were gone, Teg pulled himself up onto one of the chairs and looked into the empty room visible beyond the seewall. It had been close there and he still felt his heart pumping hard from the effort. “Quite a show,” he said.\n“I’ve seen better.” Extremely dry.\n“What I'd like right now is a large glass of Marinete, but | doubt this body could take it.”\n“Bell will be waiting for Dar when she gets back to Central,” Idaho said.\n“To the nethermost hell with Bell! We have to defuse those Honored Matres before they find us.”\n“And our Bashar has just the plan.”\n“Damn that title!”\nIdaho inhaled a sharp breath restricted by shock.\n“Tell you something, Duncan!” Intense. “Once when I was arriving for an important meeting with potential enemies, | heard an aide announce me. ‘The Bashar is here.’ | damned near stumbled, caught by the abstraction.”\n“Mentat blur.”\n“Of course it was. But | knew the title removed me from something | did not dare lose. Bashar? | was more than that! | was Miles Teg, the name given me by my parents.”\n“You were on the name-chain!”\n“Certainly, and | realized my name stood at a distance from something more primal. Miles Teg? No, | was more basic than that. | could hear my mother saying, ‘Oh, what a beautiful baby.’ So there | was with another name: ‘Beautiful Baby.’”\n“Did you go deeper?” Idaho found himself fascinated.\n“I was caught. Name leads to name leads to names leads to nameless. When | walked into that important room, | was nameless. Did you ever risk that?”\n“Once.” A reluctant admission.\n“We all do it at least once. But there | was. I’d been briefed. | had a reference for everyone at that table—face, name, title, plus all of the backgrounding.”\n“But you weren’t really there.”\n“Oh, | could see the expectant faces measuring me, wondering, worrying. But they did not know me!”\n“That gave you a feeling of great power?”\n“Exactly aS we were warned in Mentat school. | asked myself: ‘Is this Mind at its beginning?’ Don’t laugh. It’s a tantalizing question.”\n“So you went deeper?” Caught by Teg’s words, Idaho ignored tugs of warning at the edge of his awareness.\n“Oh, yes. And | found myself in the famous ‘Hall of Mirrors’ they described and warned us to flee.”\n“So you remembered how to get out and...”\n“Remembered? You’ve obviously been there. Did memory get you out?”\n“It helped.”\n“Despite the warnings, | lingered, seeing my ‘self of selves’ and infinite permutations. Reflections of reflections ad infinitum.”\n“Fascination of the ‘ego core.’ Damn few ever escape from that depth. You were lucky.”\n“I’m not sure it should be called luck. | knew there must be a First Awareness, an awakening...”\n“Which discovers it is not the first.”\n“But | wanted a self at the root of the self!”\n“Didn't the people at this meeting notice anything odd about you?”\n“I found out later | sat down with a wooden expression that concealed these mental gymnastics.”\n“You didn’t speak?”\n“I was struck dumb. This was interpreted as ‘the Bashar’s expected reticence.’ So much for reputation.”\nIdaho started to smile and remembered the comeyes. He Saw at once how the watchdogs would interpret such revelations. Wild talent in a dangerous descendant of the Atreides! Sisters knew about the mirrors. Anyone who escaped must be suspect. What did the mirrors show him?\nAs though he heard the dangerous question, Teg said: “| was caught and knew it. | could visualize myself as a bedridden vegetable but | didn’t care. The mirrors were everything until, like something floating up out of water, | Saw my mother. She looked more or less the way she had just before she died.”\nIdaho inhaled a trembling breath. Didn’t Teg know what he had just said for the comeyes to record?\n“The Sisters will now imagine I’m at least a potential Kwisatz Haderach,” Teg said. “Another Muad’Dib. Bullcrap!\nAs you're so fond of saying, Duncan. Neither of us would risk that. We know what he created and we're not stupid!”\nIdaho could not swallow. Would they accept Teg’s words? He spoke the truth but still...\n“She took my hand,” Teg said. “I could feel it! And she led me right out of the Hall. | expected her to be with me when | felt myself seated at the table. My hand still tingled from her touch but she was gone. | knew that. | just brought myself to attention and took over. The Sisterhood had important advantages to gain there and | gained them.”\n“Something your mother planted in—”\n“No! | saw her the same way Reverend Mothers see Other Memory. It was her way of saying: ‘Why the hell are you wasting time here when there’s work to do?’ She has never left me, Duncan. The past never leaves any of us.”\nIdaho abruptly saw the purpose behind Teg’s recital. Honesty and candor, indeed!\n“You have Other Memory!”\n“No! Except what anyone has in emergencies. The Hall of Mirrors was an emergency and it also let me see and feel the source of help. But I’m not going back there!”\nIdaho accepted this. Most Mentats risked one dip into Infinity and learned the transient nature of names and titles but Teg’s account was much more than a statement about Time as flow and tableau.\n“I figured it was time we introduced ourselves fully to the Bene Gesserit,” Teg said. “They should know how far they can trust us. There’s work to do and we've wasted enough time on stupidities.”\nSpend energies on those who make you strong. Energy spent on weaklings drags you to doom. (HM rule) Bene Gesserit Commentary: Who judges?\n—THE DORTUJLA RECORD\nhe day of Dortujla’s return did not go well for Odrade. A\nweapons conference with Teg and Idaho ended without decision. She had sensed the hunter’s axe all during the meeting and knew this colored her reactions.\nThen the afternoon session with Murbella—words, words, words. Murbella was tangled in questions of philosophy. A dead end if Odrade had ever encountered one.\nNow she stood in the early evening at the westernmost edge of Central’s perimeter paving. It was one of her favorite places, but Bellonda beside her deprived Odrade of the anticipated quiet enjoyment.\nSheeana found them there and asked: “Is it true you have given Murbella the freedom of the ship?”\n“There!” This was one of Bellonda’s deepest fears.\n“Bell,” Odrade cut her off and pointed at the ring orchards. “That little rise over there where we’ve planted no trees. | want you to order a Folly in that place, built to my requirements. A gazebo with lattice framing for the views.”\nNo stopping Bellonda now. Odrade had seldom seen her this incensed. And the more Bellonda ranted, the more adamant Odrade became.\n“You wanta...a Folly? In that orchard? What else will you waste our substance on? Folly! A most appropriate label for another of your...”\nIt was a silly argument. Both of them knew it twenty words into the thing. Mother Superior could not unbend first and Bell seldom unbent for anything. Even when Odrade fell silent, Bellonda charged onward into empty ramparts. At the end, when Bellonda ran out of energy, Odrade said: “You owe me a fine dinner, Bell. See that it’s the best you can arrange.”\n“Owe you...” Bellonda started to splutter.\n“A peace offering,” Odrade said. “I want it served in my gazebo... my Fancy Folly.”\nWhen Sheeana laughed, Bellonda was forced to join but with an icy edge. She knew when she had been out-faced.\n“Everyone will see it and say: ‘See how confident Mother Superior is,’” Sheeana said.\n“So you want it for morale!” At this point, Bellonda would have accepted almost any justification.\nOdrade beamed at Sheeana. My clever little darling! Not only had Sheeana ceased teasing Bellonda, she had taken to reinforcing the older woman’s self-esteem wherever possible. Bell knew it, of course, and there remained an inevitable Bene Gesserit question: Why?\nRecognizing the suspicion, Sheeana said:"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_458558f096a915466b60565c4d8a470149dc3b7bfde729fd9b1699780925468e_v2"}
