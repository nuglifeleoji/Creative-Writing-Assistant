Known as Leto II, the God Emperor, he underwent a metamorphosis into a sandworm hybrid, ruling with an iron grip akin to his predecessor, Muad'Dib. His rule was defined by manipulation of the Group Soul and the preservation of the Sisterhood for his own purposes, ensuring their survival while bending them to his will.  \n\nA master strategist, the Tyrant concealed a vast spice hoard in Sietch Tabr and may have allowed the construction of the no-globe complex to drain the Harkonnens' wealth, demonstrating his foresight and economic cunning. His legacy is deeply intertwined with the Bene Gesserit, as his words, warnings, and the concept of the Golden Path remain influential, guiding their actions long after his death.  \n\nThe Tyrant's philosophy and designs persist through time, with his messages and symbols—such as the term *Arafel*, representing judgment—echoing in contemporary events. Though often remembered as a despotic ruler (referred to as Shaitan), his reign was also one of calculated necessity, ensuring humanity's survival through his harsh but prescient vision.
