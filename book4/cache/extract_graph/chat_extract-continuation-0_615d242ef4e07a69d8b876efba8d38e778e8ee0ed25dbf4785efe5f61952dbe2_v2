足，他要干什么事，就干成了，而过去，就是能干成的事，也常常干不成！在劳力缺乏的时候，少安突然想起了田二的小子憨牛。责任制后，憨牛没人管了。老憨汉一死，小憨汉尽管有一身好力气，但自己料理不了生活，几乎顿顿饭都生吃。少安想，让憨牛到他的烧砖窑来做活，他给管饭，并且一天给开一点工钱；这样既解决了憨牛的问题，也解决了他的问题。至于憨牛那点地，他相帮着捎带就做了。 \n　　少安无法和田牛“商量”这件事，他索性把这个憨后生领到砖窑来干活了——就象领回来一只无主的狗。村里人对此也没什么非议，舆论一般还认为是积德行为。这样一来，少安的劳力危机就缓和许多。憨牛力大无比，还专爱干重活，担水，和泥，从早到晚象牲畜一样，除过干活，连句话也不说。只是他饭量大了一点，一个人几乎吃两个人的；但算算帐，用这个劳力只有好处没有坏处。在这样顺心的时候，孙少安也隐隐地有一些另外的不安，他总觉得，他和秀莲独占这一院新地方不太合适，应该把父母亲也搬过来。 \n　　但他又知道，秀莲不情愿这样，他的妻子搬到了新地方以后，分家的意识表现得越来越强烈。现在，她自己有时候甚至不回父母那里去吃饭；而利用一点简单的炊具在新居这面做着吃。这使少安十分难堪。更不象话的是，秀莲对待老人的态度也不象前几年那样乖顺；回到家里，常常闷着头不言不语。很明显，在老人和秀莲之间，已经出现了一种危险的裂痕；作为儿子又作为丈夫的他，手足无措地被推到了这个令人尴尬的夹缝中间。 \n　　生活啊……叫人怎么说呢？ \n　　尽管秀莲不会欢迎父母迁入新居，但少安意识到他不能对这件事装聋作哑——他要主动请求父母也搬到新窑来住。老人钻了一辈子黑窑洞，现在修起新地方不让他们过来，实在说不过去呀！ \n　　种麦之前，少安在山里单独和父亲劳动时，便直截了当表示了他的心愿。 \n　　父亲半天没有说话。 \n　　他抽完一锅烟以后，才思思虑虑地说：“你的心意爸爸理解。爸爸也正准备和你拉谈拉谈……“我们不能搬过去住。我和你妈已经商量过了，从今往后，你和秀莲应该单独过日子。” \n　　“你说分家？不！”少安叫道。 \n　　“你听爸爸说，如今分开家，我和你妈除不难过，心里还乐意哩！看见你整修起一院新地方，我们高兴得一夜合不住眼啊！你爷爷和我，苦熬了一辈子又一辈子，谁也没能在双水�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少安<|>PERSON<|>少安
