娜娜略微沉默了一下，内心之中，难以名状的情绪上涌，“不行的，这个空间之门太不稳定了。我如果过去，会导致空间紊乱，会很麻烦。”\n------------\n\n第九十四章 召唤试验\n\n    蓝轩宇顿时大为失望，不过能和娜娜说话，他还是很开心，“娜娜老师，哎，您等一下。”\n\n    不能不暂时停下来，因为周围的熔岩犬已经冲上来了。\n\n    “你跟老师说话吧，这些交给我。”一边说着，冻千秋已经冲了出去，手中深蓝色冰枪横扫，大战熔岩犬。得到蓝轩宇增幅的刘锋紧随其后，也跟着她一起冲了出去。\n\n    “轩宇，你先听我说。你能召唤千秋这个事儿有些奇怪。老师需要你配合我做一些试验。”娜娜的声音再次响起。\n\n    “好啊！我也不知道是怎么回事儿呢。正好可以问问您。”\n\n    娜娜道：“接下来我需要你分别在每十分钟后尝试一次召唤，你们那边能够做到吗？”\n\n    蓝轩宇看向钱磊。\n\n    钱磊道：“如果战斗结束的快，应该是没问题的。”\n\n    娜娜道：“那好，先进行尝试吧。然后我再给你解释。”\n\n    “哦哦。”\n\n    有了冻千秋的加入，对付那些熔岩犬自然不在话下。而且通过实验，刘锋也发现，蓝轩宇每次对自己的增幅，只能持续的让自己完成一次攻击。但如果是用金纹蓝银草缠绕在自己身上，他的攻击力就会一直被增强。白龙枪就像是苏醒了一般，会附带有龙吟声，攻击力比之前增强许多，就连他对速度的控制也要强得多了。实力增加何止一筹。\n\n    完成考核，再进入，再召唤。\n\n    连续三次尝试，两次成功，一次失败。\n\n    第四次召唤，成功。\n\n    “千秋，暂时别杀光那些熔岩犬，我有话对轩宇说。”另一边再次传来娜娜的声音。\n\n    “好的，老师。”\n\n    “娜娜老师，究竟是怎么回事啊？”蓝轩宇好奇的问道。\n\n    娜娜道：“你们能够通过这召唤之门和我进行联系，最重要的原因在于空间同位共振所导致。所谓空间同位共振，就是在不同空间出现同频率的空间震荡，这两个频率就有可能产生共鸣，随之形成空间通道进行连接。”\n\n    “但是，这种情况几乎是不太可能出现的，因为概率太低。所以，你们现在的召唤，是非常特殊的情况。所以，轩宇你接下来要跟老师做几次试验，让我确定一下同位共振究竟是从何而来。”\n\n    “好的。”蓝轩宇连连点头。\n\n    旁边的钱磊和刘锋都看傻了，这是什么情况，钱磊的召唤之门另一边，居然有蓝轩宇的老师？\n\n    两人疑惑的看着蓝轩宇，一�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
