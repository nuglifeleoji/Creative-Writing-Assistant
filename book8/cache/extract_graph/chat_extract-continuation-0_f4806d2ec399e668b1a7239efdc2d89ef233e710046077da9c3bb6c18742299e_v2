那是一个高约三十厘米的手办，是一名身穿金色甲胄的男子。蓝潇告诉他，那可不是普通的甲胄，而是斗铠。是特别厉害的魂师才能拥有的一种存在。而买给他的这个手办更是很有意义，乃是在人类历史上，几位最强大的魂师之一的模型。\n\n    整个手办制作非常精细，足有七十多个组成部分，最多的就是那些金色的斗铠配件，极为精美。相当的炫酷。\n\n    手办一身金色斗铠护体，相貌上却有些模糊，据说是联邦专门规定，这种大能不允许把相貌完全模拟出来。也可能是因为当初的那位根本就没有特别完整的相貌留存下来。毕竟已经过去了万年。\n\n    他的称号叫龙皇斗罗，他的那身金色斗铠，叫做金龙月语！\n\n    “妈妈，你说我以后能拥有斗铠吗？我会有什么样的斗铠啊？”蓝轩宇转移着话题，雀跃的问着。同样的问题，他都不知道问过多少次了。斗铠实在是让他这个小小魂师太感兴趣了。\n\n    “会的、会的。只要你努力修炼，一定会成为斗铠师的。每一条路径都能走向巅峰。最强大的斗铠师，可是能够媲美战舰战斗力的哦。”蓝潇笑道。\n\n    “爸爸、妈妈，那你们都是魂师，为什么不是斗铠师啊？”蓝轩宇好奇的问道。\n\n    南澄苦笑道：“斗铠师哪有那么容易，那需要巨大的资源支持。只有主战的魂师，才有资格申请。而且审批极其严格。每一位斗铠师的耗费都太大了。而想要自己去打造斗铠成为斗铠师，那需要的财富可是天文数字。所以，你只有成为最优秀的那一类，才有可能成为斗铠师哦。”\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“那怎么才算是最优秀的呢？”\n\n    南澄捏了捏他粉嫩嫩的面颊，“儿子你今天的疑问好多哦。想要成为最优秀的，你初级学院毕业时先考上天罗学院本院的中级学院吧。那样的话就有机会了。”\n\n    “嗯呢。我一定要成为斗铠师！”蓝轩宇信誓旦旦的道。\n\n    蓝潇挪揄道：“前些天还有人说要成为战舰驾驶员呢。这就变啦？”\n\n    蓝轩宇小脸微微有些涨红，“我都做呀！”\n\n    “哈哈。”蓝潇和南澄不约而同的笑了起来。\n\n    “走啦，最后一站，大购物。今天陪你妈妈买痛快了。回去咱们爷俩的日子才能好过。”\n\n    为了避免前面花钱太多以至于影响到后面的旅行，南澄和蓝潇商量之后，就决定最后一天再大采购。\n\n    联邦的物价非常稳定，不存在不同星球有着�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
