And he said: “Goodbye, beloved.”\nShe did not hear the finality in his voice, even kissed him lightly as he left.\nAnd all the way down through the sietchlike maze of Temple corridors, Idaho brushed at his eyes. Tleilaxu eyes were not immune to tears.\nYou have loved Caladan And lamented its lost host— But pain discovers New lovers cannot erase Those forever ghost.\n—REFRAIN FROM THE HABBANYA LAMENT\ntilgar quadrupled the sietch guard around the twins, but\nhe knew it was useless. The lad was like his Atreides namesake, the grandfather Leto. Everyone who'd known the original Duke remarked on it. Leto had the measuring look about him, and caution, yes, but all of it had to be evaluated against that latent wildness, the susceptibility to dangerous decisions.\nGhanima was more like her mother. There was Chani’s red hair, the set of Chani’s eyes, and a calculating way about her when she adjusted to difficulties. She often said that she only did what she had to do, but where Leto led she would follow.\nAnd Leto was going to lead them into danger.\nNot once did Stilgar think of taking his problem to Alia. That ruled out Irulan, who ran to Alia with anything and everything. In coming to his decision, Stilgar realized he had accepted the possibility that Leto judged Alia correctly.\nShe uses people in a casual and callous way, he thought. She even uses Duncan that way. It isn’t so much that she’d turn on me and kill me. She’d discard me.\nMeanwhile the guard was strengthened and Stilgar stalked his sietch like a robed specter, prying everywhere. All the time, his mind seethed with the doubts Leto had\nplanted there. If one could not depend upon tradition, then where was the rock upon which to anchor his life?\nOn the afternoon of the Convocation of Welcome for the Lady Jessica, Stilgar spied Ghanima standing with her grandmother at the entrance lip to the sietch’s great assembly chamber. It was early and Alia had not yet arrived, but people already were thronging into the chamber, casting surreptitious glances at the child and adult as they passed.\nStilgar paused in a shadowed alcove out of the crowd flow and watched the pair of them, unable to hear their words above the murmuring throb of an assembling multitude. The people of many tribes would be here today to welcome back their old Reverend Mother. But he stared at Ghanima. Her eyes, the way they danced when she spoke! The movement fascinated him. Those deep blue, steady, demanding, measuring eyes. And that way of throwing her red-gold hair off her shoulder with a twist of the head: that was Chani. It was a ghostly resurrection, an uncanny resemblance.\nSlowly Stilgar drew closer and took up his station in another alcove.\nHe could not associate Ghanima’s observing manner with any other child of his experience—except her brother. Where was Leto? Stilgar glanced back up the crowded passage. His guards would have spread an alarm if anything were amiss. He shook his head. These twins assaulted his sanity. They were a constant abrasion against his peace of mind. He could almost hate them. Kin were not immune from one’s hatred, but blood (and its precious water) carried demands for one’s countenance which transcended most other concerns. These twins existed as his greatest responsibility.\nDust-filtered brown light came from the cavernous assembly chamber beyond Ghanima and Jessica. It touched the child’s shoulders and the new white robe she wore, backlighting her hair as she turned to peer into the passage at the people thronging past.\nWhy did Leto afflict me with these doubts? he wondered. There was no doubt that it had been done deliberately. Perhaps Leto wanted me to have a small share of his own mental experience. Stilgar knew why the twins were different, but had always found his reasoning processes unable to accept what he knew. He had never experienced the womb as prison to an awakened consciousness—a living awareness from the second month of gestation, so it was said.\nLeto had once said that his memory was like “an internal holograph, expanding in size and in detail from that original shocked awakening, but never changing shape or outline.”\nFor the first time, as he watched Ghanima and the Lady Jessica, Stilgar began to understand what it must be like to live in such a scrambled web of memories, unable to retreat or find a sealed room of the mind. Faced with such a condition, one had to integrate madness, to select and reject from a multitude of offerings in a system where answers changed as fast as the question.\nThere could be no fixed tradition. There could be no absolute answers to double-faced questions. What works? That which does not work. What does not work? That which works. He recognized this pattern. It was the old Fremen game of riddles. Question: “It brings death and life.” Answer: “The Coriolis wind.”\nWhy did Leto want me to understand this? Stilgar asked himself. From his cautious probings, Stilgar knew that the twins shared a common view of their difference: they thought of it as affliction. The birth canal would be a draining place to such a one, he thought. Ignorance reduces the shock of some experiences, but they would have no ignorance about birth. What would it be like to live a life where you knew all of the things that could go wrong? You would face a constant war with doubts. You would resent your difference from your fellows. It would be pleasant to\ninflict others with even a taste of that difference. “Why me?” would be your first unanswered question.\nAnd what have I been asking myself? Stilgar thought. A wry smile touched his lips. Why me?\nSeeing the twins in this new way, he understood the dangerous chances they took with their uncompleted bodies. Ghanima had put it to him succinctly once after he’d berated her for climbing the precipitous west face to the rim above Sietch Tabr.\n“Why should | fear death? I’ve been there before—many times.”\nHow can I presume to teach such children? Stilgar wondered. How can anyone presume?\nx x OX\nddly, Jessica’s thoughts were moving in a similar vein as\nshe talked to her granddaughter. She’d been thinking how difficult it must be to carry mature minds in immature bodies. The body would have to learn what the mind already knew it could do—aligning responses and reflexes. The old Bene Gesserit prana-bindu regimen would be available to them, but even there the mind would run where the flesh could not. Gurney had a supremely difficult task carrying out her orders.\n“Stilgar is watching us from an alcove back there,” Ghanima said.\nJessica did not turn. But she found herself confounded by what she heard in Ghanima’s voice. Ghanima loved the old Fremen as one would love a parent. Even while she spoke lightly of him and teased him, she loved him. The realization forced Jessica to see the old Naib in a new light, understanding in a gestalten revelation what the twins and Stilgar shared. This new Arrakis did not fit Stilgar well, Jessica realized. No more than this new universe fitted her grandchildren.\nUnwanted and undemanded, a Bene Gesserit saying flowed through Jessica’s mind: “7o suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror; to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror.”\nYes, death would not be a hard yoke to wear, but life was a slow fire to Stilgar and the twins. Each found an ill-fitting world and longed for other ways where variations might be known without threat. They were children of Abraham, learning more from a hawk stooping over the desert than from any book yet written.\nLeto had confounded Jessica only that morning as they’d stood beside the qanat which flowed below the sietch. He’d said: “Water traps us, grandmother. We'd be better off living like dust because then the wind could carry us higher than the highest cliffs of the Shield Wall.”\nAlthough she was familiar with such devious maturity from the mouths of these children, Jessica had been caught by this utterance, but had managed: “Your father might’ve said that.”\nAnd Leto, throwing a handful of sand into the air to watch it fall: “Yes, he might’ve. But my father did not consider then how quickly water makes everything fall back to the ground from which it came.”\nNow, standing beside Ghanima in the sietch, Jessica felt the shock of those words anew. She turned, glanced back at the still-flowing throng, let her gaze wander across Stilgar’s Shadowy shape in the alcove. Stilgar was no tame Fremen, trained only to carry twigs to the nest. He was still a hawk. When he thought of the color red, he did not think of flowers but of blood.\n“You're so quiet, suddenly,” Ghanima said. “Is something wrong?”\nJessica shook her head. “It’s something Leto said this morning, that’s all.”\n“When you went out to the plantings? What'd he say?”\nJessica thought of the curious look of adult wisdom which had come over Leto’s face out there in the morning. It was the same look which came over Ghanima’s face right now. “He was recalling the time when Gurney came back from the smugglers to the Atreides banner,” Jessica said.\n“Then you were talking about Stilgar,” Ghanima said.\nJessica did not question how this insight occurred. The twins appeared capable of reproducing each other’s thought trains at will.\n“Yes, we were,” Jessica said. “Stilgar didn’t like to hear Gurney calling ... Paul his Duke, but Gurney’s presence forced this upon all of the Fremen. Gurney kept saying ‘My Duke.’”\n“I see,” Ghanima said. “And of course, Leto observed that he was not yet Stilgar’s Duke.”\n“That’s right.”\n“You know what he was doing to you, of course,” Ghanima said.\n“I’m not sure | do,” Jessica admitted, and she found this admission particularly disturbing because it had not occurred to her that Leto was doing anything at all to her.\n“He was trying to ignite your memories of our father,” Ghanima said. “Leto’s always hungry to know our father from the viewpoints of others who knew him.”\n“But... doesn’t Leto have...”\n“Oh, he can listen to the inner life. Certainly. But that’s not the same. You spoke about him, of course. Our father, | mean. You spoke of him as your son.”\n“Yes.” Jessica clipped it off. She did not like the feeling that these twins could turn her on and off at will, open her memories for observation, touch any emotion which attracted their interest. Ghanima might be doing that right now!\n“Leto said something to disturb you,” Ghanima said.\nJessica found herself shocked at the necessity to suppress anger. “Yes... he did.”\n“You don’t like the fact that he knows our father as our mother knew him, and knows our mother as our father knew her,” Ghanima said. “You don’t like what that implies—what we may know about you.”\n“I'd never really thought about it that way before,” Jessica said, finding her voice stiff.\n“It’s the knowledge of sensual things which usually disturbs,” Ghanima said. “It’s your", ". Certainly. But that’s not the same. You spoke about him, of course. Our father, | mean. You spoke of him as your son.”\n“Yes.” Jessica clipped it off. She did not like the feeling that these twins could turn her on and off at will, open her memories for observation, touch any emotion which attracted their interest. Ghanima might be doing that right now!\n“Leto said something to disturb you,” Ghanima said.\nJessica found herself shocked at the necessity to suppress anger. “Yes... he did.”\n“You don’t like the fact that he knows our father as our mother knew him, and knows our mother as our father knew her,” Ghanima said. “You don’t like what that implies—what we may know about you.”\n“I'd never really thought about it that way before,” Jessica said, finding her voice stiff.\n“It’s the knowledge of sensual things which usually disturbs,” Ghanima said. “It’s your conditioning. You find it extremely difficult to think of us as anything but children. But there’s nothing our parents did together, in public or in private, that we would not know.”\nFor a brief instant Jessica found herself returning to the reaction which had come over her out there beside the qanat, but now she focused that reaction upon Ghanima.\n“He probably spoke of your Duke’s ‘rutting sensuality,’” Ghanima said. “Sometimes Leto needs a bridle on his mouth!”\nIs there nothing these twins cannot profane? Jessica wondered, moving from shock to outrage to revulsion. How dared they speak of her Leto’s sensuality? Of course a man and woman who loved each other would share the pleasure of their bodies! It was a private and beautiful thing, not to be paraded in casual conversation between a child and an adult.\nChild and adult!\nAbruptly Jessica realized that neither Leto nor Ghanima had done this casually.\nAs Jessica remained silent, Ghanima said: “We've shocked you. | apologize for both of us. Knowing Leto, | know he didn’t consider apologizing. Sometimes when he’s following a particular scent, he forgets how different we are... from you, for instance.”\nJessica thought: And that is why you both do this, of course. You are teaching me! And she wondered then: Who else are you teaching? Stilgar? Duncan?\n“Leto tries to see things as you see them,” Ghanima said. “Memories are not enough. When you try the hardest, just then, you most often fail.”\nJessica sighed.\nGhanima touched her grandmother’s arm. “Your son left many things unsaid which yet must be said, even to you. Forgive us, but he loved you. Don’t you know that?”\nJessica turned away to hide the tears glistening in her eyes.\n“He knew your fears,” Ghanima said. “Just as he knew Stilgar’s fears. Dear Stil. Our father was his ‘Doctor of Beasts’ and Stil was no more than the green snail hidden in its shell.” She hummed the tune from which she’d taken these words. The music hurled the lyrics against Jessica’s awareness without compromise:\nO Doctor of Beasts,\nTo a green snail shell With its timid miracle Hidden, awaiting death, You come as a deity! Even snails know\nThat gods obliterate, And cures bring pain, That heaven is seen Through a door of flame. O Doctor of Beasts,\nlam the man-snail\nWho sees your single eye Peering into my shell! Why, Muad’Dib? Why?\nGhanima said: “Unfortunately, our father left many man- Snails in our universe.”\nThe assumption that humans exist within an essentially impermanent universe, taken as an operational precept, demands that the intellect become a totally aware balancing instrument. But the intellect cannot react thus without involving the entire organism. Such an organism may be recognized by its burning, driving behavior. And thus it is with a society treated as organism. But here we encounter an old inertia. Societies move to the goading of ancient, reactive impulses. They demand permanence. Any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns, fear, anger, and despair. Then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience? Simply: the giver of prescient visions, because he speaks of an absolute (permanent) realization, may be greeted with joy by humankind even while predicting the most dire events.\n—THE BOOK OF LETO AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\n44 | t's like fighting in the dark,” Alia said.\nShe paced the Council Chamber in angry strides, moving from the tall silvery draperies which softened the morning sun at the eastern windows to the divans grouped beneath decorated wall panels at the room’s opposite end. Her sandals crossed spice-fiber rugs, parquet wood, tiles of giant garnet and, once more, rugs. At last she stood over lrulan and Idaho, who sat facing each other on divans of grey whale fur.\nIdaho had resisted returning from Tabr, but she had sent peremptory orders. The abduction of Jessica was more important than ever now, but it had to wait. Idaho’s mentat perceptions were required.\n“These things are cut from the same pattern,” Alia said. “They stink of a far-reaching plot.”\n“Perhaps not,” Irulan ventured, but she glanced questioningly at Idaho.\nAlia’s face lapsed into an undisguised sneer. How could lrulan be that innocent? Unless... Alia bent a sharp and questioning stare onto the Princess. Irulan wore a simple black aba robe which matched the shadows in her spice- indigo eyes. Her blonde hair was tied in a tight coil at the nape of her neck, accenting a face thinned and toughened by years on Arrakis. She still retained the haughtiness she’d learned in the court of her father, Shaddam IV, and Alia often felt that this prideful attitude could mask the thoughts of a conspirator.\nIdaho lounged in the black-and-green uniform of an Atreides House Guard, no insignia. It was an affectation which was secretly resented by many of Alia’s actual guards, especially the amazons, who gloried in insignia of office. They did not like the plain presence of the ghola- swordmaster-mentat, the more so because he was the husband of their mistress.\n“So the tribes want the Lady Jessica reinstated into the Regency Council,” Idaho said. “How can that—”\n“They make unanimous demand!” Alia said, pointing to an embossed sheet of spice-paper on the divan beside lrulan. “Farad’n is one thing, but this . . . this has the stink of other alignments!”\n“What does Stilgar think?” Irulan asked.\n“His signature’s on that paper!” Alia said.\n“But if he...”\n“How could he deny the mother of his god?” Alia sneered.\nIdaho looked up at her, thinking: That’s awfully close to the edge with Irulan! Again he wondered why Alia had brought him back here when she knew that he was needed at Sietch Tabr if the abduction plot were to be carried off. Was it possible she’d heard about the message sent to him by The Preacher? This thought filled his breast with turmoil. How could that mendicant mystic know the secret signal by which Paul Atreides had always summoned his\nswordmaster? Idaho longed to leave this pointless meeting and return to the search for an answer to that question.\n“There’s no doubt that The Preacher has been off-planet,” Alia said. “The Guild wouldn’t dare deceive us in sucha thing. | will have him—”\n“Careful!” Irulan said.\n“Indeed, have a care,” Idaho said. “Half the planet believe him to be—” He shrugged. “—your brother.” And Idaho hoped he had carried this off with a properly casual attitude. How had the man known that signal?\n“But if he’s a courier, or a spy of the—”\n“He’s made contact with no one from CHOAM or House Corrino,” Irulan said. “We can be sure of—”\n“We can be sure of nothing!” Alia did not try to hide her scorn. She turned her back on Irulan, faced Idaho. He knew why he was here! Why didn’t he perform as expected? He was in Council because Irulan was here. The history which had brought a Princess of House Corrino into the Atreides fold could never be forgotten. Allegiance, once changed, could change again. Duncan’s mentat powers should be searching for flaws, for subtle deviations in Irulan’s behavior.\nIdaho stirred, glanced at Irulan. There were times when he resented the straight-line necessities imposed on mentat performance. He knew what Alia was thinking. Irulan would know it as well. But this Princess-wife to Paul Muad’Dib had overcome the decisions which had made her less than the royal concubine, Chani. There could be no doubt of Irulan’s devotion to the royal twins. She had renounced family and Bene Gesserit in dedication to the Atreides.\n“My mother is part of this plot!” Alia insisted. “For what other reason would the Sisterhood send her back here at a time such as this?”\n“Hysteria isn’t going to help us,” Idaho said.\nAlia whirled away from him, as he’d known she would. It helped him that he did not have to look at that once- beloved face which was now so twisted by alien possession.\n“Well,” Irulan said, “the Guild can’t be completely trusted for—”\n“The Guild!” Alia sneered.\n“We can’t rule out the enmity of the Guild or the Bene Gesserit,” Idaho said. “But we must assign them special categories as essentially passive combatants. The Guild will live up to its basic rule: Never Govern. They’re a parasitic growth, and they know it. They won’t do anything to kill the organism which keeps them alive.”\n“Their idea of which organism keeps them alive may be different from ours,” Irulan drawled. It was the closest she ever came to a sneer, that lazy tone of voice which said: “You missed a point, mentat.”\nAlia appeared puzzled. She had not expected Irulan to take this tack. It was not the kind of view which a conspirator would want examined.\n“No doubt,” Idaho said. “But the Guild won’t come out overtly against House Atreides. The Sisterhood, on the other hand, might risk a certain kind of political break which—”\n“If they do, it'll be through a front: someone or some group they can disavow,” Irulan said. “The Bene Gesserit haven’t existed all of these centuries without knowing the value of self-effacement. They prefer being behind the throne, not on it.”\nSelf-effacement? Alia wondered. Was that Irulan’s choice?\n“Precisely the point | make about the Guild,” Idaho said. He found the necessities of argument and explanation helpful. They kept his mind from other problems.\nAlia strode back toward the sunlit windows. She knew Idaho’s blind spot; every mentat had it. They had to make pronouncements. This brought about a tendency to depend upon absolutes, to see finite limits. They knew this about themselves. It was part of their training. Yet they continued to act beyond self-limiting parameters. / should’ve left him at Sietch Tabr, Alia thought. /t would’ve been better to just turn Irulan over to Javid for questioning.\nWithin her skull, Alia heard a rumbling voice: “Exactly!”\nShut up! Shut up! Shut up! she thought. A dangerous mistake beckoned her in these moments and she", " behind the throne, not on it.”\nSelf-effacement? Alia wondered.

Shut up! Shut up! she thought. A dangerous mistake beckoned her in these moments and she could not recognize its outlines. All she could sense was the danger. Idaho had to help her out of this predicament. He was a mentat. Mentats were necessary. The human-computer replaced the mechanical devices destroyed by the Butlerian Jihad. Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind! But Alia longed now for a compliant machine. They could not have suffered from Idaho’s limitations. You could never distrust a machine.\nAlia heard Irulan’s drawling voice.\n“A feint within a feint within a feint within a feint,” Irulan said. “We all know the accepted pattern of attack upon power. | don’t blame Alia for her suspicions. Of course she suspects everyone—even us. Ignore that for the moment, though. What remains as the prime arena of motives, the most fertile source of danger to the Regency?”\n“CHOAM,” Idaho said, his voice mentat-flat.\nAlia allowed herself a grim smile. The Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles! But House Atreides dominated CHOAM with fifty-one percent of its shares. The Priesthood of Muad’Dib held another five percent, pragmatic acceptance by the Great Houses that Dune controlled the priceless melange. Not without reason was the spice often called “the secret coinage.” Without melange, the Spacing Guild’s heighliners could not move. Melange precipitated the “navigation trance” by which a translight pathway could be “seen” before it was traveled. Without melange and its amplification of the human immunogenic system, life expectancy for the very rich degenerated by a factor of at least four. Even the vast middle class of the Imperium ate diluted melange in small sprinklings with at least one meal a day.\nBut Alia had heard the mentat sincerity in Idaho’s voice, a sound which she’d been awaiting with terrible expectancy.\nCHOAM. The Combine Honnete was much more than House Atreides, much more than Dune, much more than the Priesthood or melange. It was inkvines, whale fur, shigawire, Ixian artifacts and entertainers, trade in people and places, the Hajj, those products which came from the borderline legality of Tleilaxu technology; it was addictive drugs and medical techniques; it was transportation (the Guild) and all of the supercomplex commerce of an empire which encompassed thousands of known planets plus some which fed secretly at the fringes, permitted there for services rendered. When Idaho said CHOAM, he spoke of a constant ferment, intrigue within intrigue, a play of powers where the shift of one duodecimal point in interest payments could change the ownership of an entire planet.\nAlia returned to stand over the two seated on the divans. “Something specific about CHOAM bothers you?” she asked.\n“There’s always the heavy speculative stockpiling of spice by certain Houses,” Irulan said.\nAlia slapped her hands against her own thighs, then gestured at the embossed spice-paper beside Irulan. “That demand doesn’t intrigue you, coming as it does—”\n“All right!” Idaho barked. “Out with it. What’re you withholding? You know better than to deny the data and still expect me to function as—”\n“There has been a recent very significant increase in trade for people with four specific specialties,” Alia said. And she wondered if this would be truly new information for this pair.\n“Which specialties?” Irulan asked.\n“Swordmasters, twisted mentats from Tleilax, conditioned medics from the Suk school, and fincap accountants, most especially the latter. Why would questionable bookkeeping be in demand right now?” She directed the question at Idaho.\nFunction as a mentat, he thought. Well, that was better than dwelling on what Alia had become. He focused on her\nwords, replaying them in his mind mentat fashion. Swordmasters? That had been his own calling once. Swordmasters were, of course, more than personal fighters. They could repair force shields, plan military campaigns, design military support facilities, improvise weapons. Twisted mentats? The Tleilaxu persisted in this hoax, obviously. As a mentat himself, Idaho knew the fragile insecurity of Tleilaxu twisting. Great Houses which bought such mentats hoped to control them absolutely. Impossible! Even Piter de Vries, who'd served the Harkonnens in their assault on House Atreides, had maintained his own essential dignity, accepting death rather than surrender his inner core of selfdom at the end. Suk doctors? Their conditioning Supposedly guaranteed them against disloyalty to their owner-patients. Suk doctors came very expensive. Increased purchase of Suks would involve substantial exchanges of funds.\nIdaho weighed these facts against an increase in fincap accountants.\n“Prime computation,” he said, indicating a heavily weighted assurance that he spoke of inductive fact. “There’s been a recent increase in wealth among Houses Minor. Some have to be moving quietly toward Great House status. Such wealth could only come from some specific shifts in political alignments.”\n“We come at last to the Landsraad,” Alia said, voicing her own belief.\n“The next Landsraad session is almost two standard years away,” Irulan reminded her.\n“But political bargaining never ceases,” Alia said. “And I'll warrant some among those tribal signatories—” She gestured at the paper beside Irulan. “—are among the Houses Minor who’ve shifted their alignment.”\n“Perhaps,” Irulan said.\n“The Landsraad,” Alia said. “What better front for the Bene Gesserits? And what better agent for the Sisterhood\nthan my own mother?” Alia planted herself directly in front of Idaho. “Well, Duncan?”\nWhy not function as a mentat? Idaho asked himself. He saw the tenor of Alia’s suspicions now. After all, Duncan Idaho had been personal house guard to the Lady Jessica for many years.\n“Duncan?” Alia pressed.\n“You should inquire closely after any advisory legislation which may be under preparation for the next session of the Landsraad,” Idaho said. “They might take the legal position that a Regency can’t veto certain kinds of legislation— specifically, adjustments of taxation and the policing of cartels. There are others, but...”\n“Not a very good pragmatic bet on their part if they take that position,” Irulan said.\n“I agree,” Alia said. “The Sardaukar have no teeth and we still have our Fremen legions.”\n“Careful, Alia,” Idaho said. “Our enemies would like nothing better than to make us appear monstrous. No matter how many legions you command, power ultimately rides on popular sufferance in an empire as scattered as this one.”\n“Popular sufferance?” Irulan asked.\n“You mean Great House sufferance,” Alia said.\n“And how many Great Houses will we face under this new alliance?” Idaho asked. “Money is collecting in strange places!”\n“The fringes?” Irulan asked.\nIdaho shrugged. It was an unanswerable question. All of them suspected that one day the Tleilaxu or technological tinkerers on the Imperial fringes would nullify the Holtzmann Effect. On that day, shields would be useless. The whole precarious balance which maintained planetary feudatories would collapse.\nAlia refused to consider that possibility. “We'll ride with what we have,” she said. “And what we have is a certain\nknowledge throughout the CHOAM directorate that we can destroy the spice if they force us to it. They won’t risk that.”\n“Back to CHOAM again,” Irulan said.\n“Unless someone has managed to duplicate the sandtrout-sandworm cycle on another planet,” Idaho said. He looked speculatively at Irulan, excited by this question. “Salusa Secundus?”\n“My contacts there remain reliable,” Irulan said. “Not Salusa.”\n“Then my answer stands,” Alia said, staring at Idaho. “We ride with what we have.”\nMy move, Idaho thought. He said: “Why’d you drag me away from important work? You could’ve worked this out yourself.”\n“Don’t take that tone with me!” Alia snapped.\nIdaho’s eyes went wide. For an instant, he’d seen the alien on Alia’s face, and it was a disconcerting sight. He turned his attention to Irulan, but she had not seen—or gave that appearance.\n“| don’t need an elementary education,” Alia said, her voice still edged with alien anger.\nIdaho managed a rueful smile, but his breast ached.\n“We never get far from wealth and all of its masks when we deal with power,” Irulan drawled. “Paul was a social mutation and, as such, we have to remember that he shifted the old balance of wealth.”\n“Such mutations are not irreversible,” Alia said, turning away from them as though she’d not exposed her terrible difference. “Wherever there’s wealth in this empire, they know this.”\n“They also know,” Irulan said, “that there are three people who could perpetuate that mutation: the twins and...” She pointed at Alia.\nAre they insane, this pair? |\\daho wondered.\n“They will try to assassinate me!” Alia rasped.\nAnd Idaho sat in shocked silence, his mentat awareness whirling. Assassinate Alia? Why? They could discredit her too easily. They could cut her out of the Fremen pack and hunt her down at will. But the twins, now... He knew he was not in the proper mentat calm for such an assessment, but he had to try. He had to be as precise as possible. At the same time, he knew that precise thinking contained undigested absolutes. Nature was not precise. The universe was not precise when reduced to his scale; it was vague and fuzzy, full of unexpected movements and changes. Humankind as a whole had to be entered into this computation as a natural phenomenon. And the whole process of precise analysis represented a chopping off, a remove from the ongoing current of the universe. He had to get at that current, see it in motion.\n“We were right to focus on CHOAM and the Landsraad,” lrulan drawled. “And Duncan’s suggestion offers a first line of inquiry for—”\n“Money as a translation of energy can’t be separated from the energy it expresses,” Alia said. “We all know this. But we have to answer three specific questions: When? Using what weapons? Where?”\nThe twins... the twins, Idaho thought. /t’s the twins who're in danger, not Alia.\n“You're not interested in who or how?” Irulan asked.\n“If House Corrino or CHOAM or any other group employs human instruments on this planet,” Alia said, “we stand a better than sixty percent chance of finding them before they act. Knowing when they'll act and where gives us a bigger leverage on those odds.
