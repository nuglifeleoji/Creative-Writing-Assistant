He is primarily recognized for his military service and political roles in the region of 益州 (Yizhou).\n\nInitially, 黄权 is sent by 张鲁 (Zhang Lu) to assist in ongoing conflicts, indicating his involvement in the military strategies and operations of the time. He is also known for his opposition to the surrender of 刘璋 (Liu Zhang), demonstrating his loyalty to his cause and his commitment to resisting external pressures during a tumultuous period.\n\n黄权 serves under 汉中王 (Han Zhongwang), which highlights his position within the political hierarchy and his influence in the governance of the region. His military capabilities are further acknowledged when he is appointed as the 右将军 (Right General), a title that signifies his rank and responsibilities in the military structure, particularly under the leadership of 玄德 (Xuande), also known as 刘备 (Liu Bei).\n\nDespite his earlier military successes and political affiliations, 黄权's fate takes a turn when he ultimately faces defeat in battle. This leads to his surrender to the rival state of 魏国 (Wei), marking a significant shift in his allegiance and reflecting the broader struggles and shifting loyalties characteristic of the era.\n\nIn summary, 黄权 is a complex figure who navigates the intricate political and military landscape of his time, serving various leaders and ultimately facing the consequences of war. His journey from a military officer assisting 张鲁 to an official opposing 刘璋, and finally to a general under 汉中王, encapsulates the challenges and dynamics of loyalty, power, and conflict during the Three Kingdoms period.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "protected_material_text": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898812, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 583, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
