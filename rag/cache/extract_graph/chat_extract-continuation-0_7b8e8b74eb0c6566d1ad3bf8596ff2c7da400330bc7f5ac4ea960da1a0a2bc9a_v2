It would be so familiar, so Supportive... and so deadly. Anteac was trying to lure him once more.\nShe spoke: “The machine cannot anticipate every problem of importance to humans. It is the difference between serial bits and an unbroken continuum. We have the one; machines are confined to the other.”\n“You still have the power of reason,” he said.\n“Share!” Luyseyal said. It was a command to Anteac and it revealed with sharp abruptness who really dominated this pair—the younger over the older.\nExquisite, Leto thought.\n“Intelligence adapts,” Anteac said.\nParsimonious with her words, too, Leto thought, hiding his amusement.\n“Intelligence creates,” Leto said. “That means you must deal with responses never before imagined. You must confront the new.”\n“Such as the possibility of the Ixian Machine,” Anteac said. It was not a question.\n“Isn't it interesting,” Leto asked, “that being a superb Reverend Mother is not enough?”\nHis acute senses detected the sudden fearful tightening in both of the women. Truthsayers, indeed!\n“You are right to fear me,” he said. Raising his voice, he demanded: “How do you know you’re even alive?”\nAs Moneo had done so many times, they heard in his voice the deadly consequences of failure to answer him correctly. It fascinated Leto that both women glanced at Moneo before either responded.\n“lam the mirror of myself,” Luyseyal said, a pat Bene Gesserit answer which Leto found offensive.\n“| don’t need pre-set tools to deal with my human problems,” Anteac said. “Your question is sophomoric!”\n“Hah, hah!” Leto laughed. “How would you like to quit the Bene Gesserit and join me?”\nHe could see her consider and then reject the invitation, but she did not hide her amusement.\nLeto looked at the puzzled Luyseyal. “If it falls outside your yardsticks, then you are engaged with intelligence, not with automation,” he said. And he thought: That Luyseyal will never again dominate old Anteac.\nLuyseyal was angry now and not bothering to conceal it. She said: “The Ixians are rumored to have provided you with machines that simulate human thinking. If you have such a low opinion of them, why...”\n“She should not be let out of the Chapter House without a guardian,” Leto said, addressing Anteac. “Is she afraid to address her own memories?”\nLuyseyal paled, but remained silent.\nLeto studied her coldly. “Our ancestors’ long unconscious relationship with machines has taught us something, don’t you think?”\nLuyseyal merely glared at him, not ready yet to risk death through open defiance of the God Emperor.\n“Would you say we at least know the attraction of machines?” Leto asked.\nLuyseyal nodded.\n“A well-maintained machine can be more reliable than a human servant,” Leto said. “We can trust machines not to indulge in emotional distractions.”\nLuyseyal found her voice. “Does this mean you intend to remove the Butlerian prohibition against abominable machines?”\n“| swear to you,” Leto said, speaking in his icy voice of disdain, “that if you display further such stupidity, | will have you publicly executed. | am not your Oracle!”\nLuyseyal opened her mouth and closed it without speaking.\nAnteac touched her companion’s arm, sending a quick tremor through Luyseyal’s body. Anteac spoke softly in an exquisite demonstration of Voice: “Our God Emperor will never openly defy the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad.”\nLeto smiled at her, a gentle commendation. It was such a pleasure to see a professional performing at her best.\n“That should be obvious to any conscious intelligence,” he said. “There are limits of my own choosing, places where | will not interfere.”\nHe could see both women absorbing the multi-pronged thrust of his words, weighing the possible meanings and intents. Was the God Emperor distracting them, focusing their attention on the Ixians while he maneuvered elsewhere? Was he telling the Bene Gesserit that the time had come to choose sides against the Ixians? Was it possible his words had no more than their surface motivations? Whatever his reasons, they could not be ignored. He was undoubtedly the most devious creature the universe had ever spawned.\nLeto scowled at Luyseyal, knowing he could only add to their confusion. “I point out to you, Marcus Claire Luyseyal, a lesson from past over-machined societies which you appear not to have learned. The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.”\nHe turned his attention to Moneo. “Moneo?”\n“I see him, Lord.”\nMoneo craned his neck to peer over the Bene Gesserit entourage. Duncan Idaho had entered the far portal, and strode across the open floor of the chamber toward Leto. Moneo did not relax his wariness, his distrust of the Bene Gesserit, but he recognized the nature of Leto’s lecture. He is testing, always testing.\nAnteac cleared her throat. “Lord, what of our reward?”\n“You are brave,” Leto said. “No doubt that’s why you were chosen for this Embassy. Very well, for the next decade | will continue your spice allotment at its present level. As for the rest, | will ignore what you really intended with the spice- essence. Am | not generous?”\n“Most generous, Lord,” Anteac said, and there was not the slightest hint of bitterness in her voice.\nDuncan Idaho brushed past the women then and stopped beside Moneo to peer up at Leto. “M’Lord, there’s .. .” He broke off and glanced at the two Reverend Mothers.\n“Speak openly,” Leto commanded.\n“Yes, m’Lord.” There was reluctance in him, but he obeyed. “We were attacked at the southeast edge of the City, a distraction | believe because there now are reports of more violence in the City and in the Forbidden Forest—many scattered raiding parties.”\n“They are hunting my wolves,” Leto said. “In the forest and in the City, they are hunting my wolves.”\nIdaho’s brows contracted into a puzzled frown. “Wolves in the City, m’Lord?”\n“Predators,” Leto said. “Wolves—to me there is no essential difference.”\nMoneo gasped.\nLeto smiled at him, thinking how beautiful it was to observe a moment of realization—a veil pulled away from the eyes, the mind opened.\n“| have brought a large force of guards to protect this place,” Idaho said. “They are posted through the...”\n“I knew you would,” Leto said. “Now pay close attention while I tell you where to send the rest of your forces.”\nAs the Reverend Mothers watched in awe, Leto laid out for Idaho the exact points for ambushes, detailing the size of each force and even some of the specific personnel, the timing, the necessary weapons, the precise deployments at each place. Idaho’s capacious memory catalogued each instruction. He was too caught up in the recital to question it until Leto fell silent, but a look of puzzled fear came over Idaho then.\nFor Leto, it was as though he peered directly into Idaho’s most essential awareness to read the thoughts there. / was a trusted soldier of the original Lord Leto, |\\daho was thinking. That Leto, the grandfather of this one, saved me and took me into his household like a son. But even though that Leto still has some kind of existence in this one... this is not him.\n“M’Lord, why do you need me?” Idaho asked.\n“For your strength and loyalty.”\nIdaho shook his head. “But...”\n“You obey,” Leto said, and he noted the way these words were being absorbed by the Reverend Mothers. Truth, only truth, for they are Truthsayers.\n“Because | owe a debt to the Atreides,” Idaho said.\n“That is where we place our trust,” Leto said. “And Duncan?”\n“M’Lord?” Idaho’s voice said he had found ground where he could stand.\n“Leave at least one survivor at each place,” Leto said. “Otherwise, our efforts are wasted.”\nIdaho nodded once, curtly, and left, striding back across the hall the way he had come. And Leto thought it would take an extremely sensitive eye indeed to see that it was a\ndifferent Idaho leaving, far different from the one who had entered.\nAnteac said: “This comes of flogging that Ambassador.”\n“Exactly,” Leto agreed. “Recount this carefully to your Superior, the admirable Reverend Mother Syaksa. Tell her for me that | prefer the company of predators above that of the prey.” He glanced at Moneo, who drew himself to attention. “Moneo, the wolves are gone from my forest. They must be replaced by human wolves. See to it.”\nThe trance-state of prophecy is like no other visionary experience. It is not a retreat from the raw exposure of the senses (as are many trance-states) but an immersion in a multitude of new movements. Things move. It is an ultimate pragmatism in the midst of Infinity, a demanding consciousness where you come at last into the unbroken awareness that the universe moves of itself, that it changes, that its rules change, that nothing remains permanent or absolute throughout all such movement, that mechanical explanations for anything can work only within precise confinements and, once the walls are broken down, the old explanations shatter and dissolve, blown away by new movements. The things you see in this trance are sobering, often shattering. They demand your utmost effort to remain whole and, even so, you emerge from that state profoundly changed.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhat night of Audience Day, while others slept and fought\nand dreamed and died, Leto took his repose in the isolation of his audience chamber, only a few trusted Fish Speaker guards at the portals.\nHe did not sleep. His mind whirled with necessities and disappointments.\nHwi! Hwi!\nHe knew why Hwi Noree had been sent to him now. How well he knew!\nMy most secret secret is exposed.\nThey had discovered his secret. Hwi was the evidence of it.\nHe thought desperate thoughts. Could this terrible metamorphosis be reversed? Could he return to a human state?\nNot possible.\nEven if it were possible, the process would take him just as long as it had taken to reach this point. Where would Hwi\nbe in more than three thousand years? Dry dust and bones in the crypt.\n! could breed something like her and prepare that one for me... but that would not be my gentle Hwi.\nAnd what of the Golden Path while he indulged in such selfish goals?\nTo hell with the Golden Path! Have these folly-bound idiots ever thought once of me? Not once!\nBut that was not true. Hwi thought of him. She shared his torture.\nThese were thoughts of madness and he tried to put them away while his senses reported the soft movement of the guards and the flow of water beneath his chamber.\nWhen I made this choice, what were my expectations?\nHow the mob within laughed at that question! Did he not have a task to complete? Was that not the very essence of the agreement which kept the mob in check?\n“You have a task to complete,” they said. “You have but one purpose.”\nSingle purpose is the mark of the fanatic and! am not a fanatic!\n“You must be cynical and cruel. You cannot break the trust.”\nWhy not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANTEAC<|>PERSON<|>Anteac is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, skilled in Voice and reasoning, and part of an embassy to the God Emperor Leto II>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUYSEYAL<|>PERSON<|>Luyseyal is a younger Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, initially dominant over Anteac but later revealed as less experienced>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO II<|>PERSON<|>The God Emperor of the known universe, a hybrid of human and sandworm, possessing vast prescience and political cunning>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a loyal servant and advisor to Leto II, wary of the Bene Gesserit and deeply attuned to Leto's intentions>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A ghola of the original Duncan Idaho, a trusted military commander and recurring figure in Atreides service>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful matriarchal order specializing in political manipulation, genetic breeding, and psychic abilities like Voice>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A technologically advanced faction rumored to create thinking machines, defying the Butlerian Jihad's prohibitions>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leto II's all-female military force, fiercely loyal and tasked with enforcing his rule>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>A historical crusade against thinking machines, whose prohibitions Leto II upholds despite his complex relationship with technology>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>Leto II's millennia-spanning plan to ensure humanity's survival by teaching it to resist stagnation and dependency>  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORBIDDEN FOREST<|>GEO<|>A protected area near Leto's city, home to his symbolic wolves and a site of rebel attacks>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTEAC<|>LUYSEYAL<|>Anteac and Luyseyal are Reverend Mothers on a joint embassy, with Luyseyal initially dominating but later exposed as less competent<|>7>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Leto II tests and manipulates the Bene Gesserit, granting them limited concessions while undermining their schemes<|>8>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Leto relies on Duncan's loyalty and military prowess but acknowledges his ghola's unresolved identity crisis<|>9>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>MONEO<|>Moneo serves as Leto's confidant and enforcer, interpreting his subtle commands with near-perfect understanding<|>9>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIANS<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Both factions vie for influence under Leto's rule, with the Bene Gesserit suspecting Ixian technological heresy<|>6>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Duncan coordinates with Fish Speaker guards to suppress rebellions, though their loyalty lies primarily with Leto<|>5>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>IXIANS<|>The Ixians defy the Jihad's machine prohibitions, creating tension with Leto's enforced orthodoxy<|>8>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>LETO II<|>The Golden Path is Leto's self-imposed duty, though he occasionally resents its sacrifices<|>10>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBIDDEN FOREST<|>LETO II<|>The forest and its wolves symbolize Leto's predatory philosophy, now under attack by rebels<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
