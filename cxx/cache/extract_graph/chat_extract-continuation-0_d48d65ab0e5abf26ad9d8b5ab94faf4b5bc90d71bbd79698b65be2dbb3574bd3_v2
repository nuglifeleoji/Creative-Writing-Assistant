说治疗，就是起码的护理也谈不上。当时我负责照看的伤员有28人，他们在两天内全死了。那些人刚死，我就离开广岛到横滨去了。做为核袭击的救护者，先后有很多人向我调查过广岛的伤亡情况。最先找我的是当时陆军参谋本部的人，天皇发布投降诏书后，第一批到广岛去的美国人也找过我，再后来，外务省和厚生省的人都找过我，具体年份我记不清了。我告诉他们所有的人，我所看护的那些伤员都死于原子弹，事实上我说了假话：那些人虽然被烧得厉害，身上黑乎乎的，但却是死于一种奇怪的病。我虽在医院干活但不是医生，对医学方面的事知道得不多，只记得那些人是死于可怕的高烧，烧到什么程度现在可能没人相信，他们的身体就象煮过了一样，皮肤滚烫，一碰就掉！ 更奇怪的是，那些人死后体温还在升高，比活着时烧得都厉害！ 我怕染上那病，连他们的尸首都没收，就离开了那里。现在我看出来，那病好象和原子弹没有什么关系，死于原子弹的人很多，大家都知道他们是怎么样死的……其时当时我就看出这一点，但仍对陆军参谋本部的人说那些人死于原子弹。当时我不敢说别的，到横滨后我亲眼看到一群女人用搓衣板打死了我对门的一个寡妇，原因是有人在她住的木屋顶上找到一盏小油灯，说那是给美国人的B--52打信号，其实那盏小油灯起码是明治时代以前的东西，灰乎乎的，灯蕊又细又干，那阵子夜风那么大，哪点得着呢！ 我以前在教会医院有几个英国朋友，人家都知道，所以不敢说别的……以后再有别人问起我我所看护过的那28个可怜的人，我就将错就错了。现在我自己也躺在医院里活不长了，回想这一辈子，就说了这么一句假话，总是过意不去。我知道那个纪念日快到了，在孩子们往那个小女孩塑像前献纸鹄的时侯，我说这些实在不好，但现在不说怕来不及说了。原子弹炸死了十几万人，那笔帐不会因为这28个人就被勾掉的。\n　　松岛老人万万没有想到，“那笔帐”不仅差点因他的这一段话而勾掉，而且差点因此而成为善行！那封信在《朝日新闻》上只登了简短得不能再简短的摘要，而且混在最后一版角落里的一大堆花边新闻中，但还是被一个美国人的锐利眼光捕捉到了，这个美国人叫戴维?克拉伦斯，是一位新泽西洲的畅销书作家。他看到这封信的摘要后如获至宝，立刻打了一个跨越大洋的电话索取了信的全文。然后，他以惊人的速度出了一本书：《善良的小男孩》（投在广岛的原子弹代号为“小男孩”）。\n######################\nOutput:",
