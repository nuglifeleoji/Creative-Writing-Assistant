“嗯呢。娜娜老师，你知道吗？今天我们实战课，我可是十连胜呢……”蓝轩宇跑过去，拉着娜娜的手，就把自己今天上课比赛的事情讲了一遍。\n\n    娜娜只是微笑的听着，看着他那兴奋的样子，不知道为什么，就连自己一直空洞的心仿佛都被装满了似的。\n\n    “娜娜老师，为什么我一抓住叶灵瞳的脚她就摔倒了啊？我没有做什么啊？”\n\n    娜娜愣了愣，眉头微蹙想了想，道：“应该是你的武魂对她比较克制吧，所以才会出现这种情况。反过来说，如果她对你没有恶意，你们共同对敌的时候，她应该也会得到增幅。”\n\n    蓝轩宇撇了撇嘴，“她脾气好差的，我才不要跟她做伙伴。娜娜老师，今天您教我什么啊？您教我的步法好厉害，他们都碰不到我呢。”\n\n

另一边的叶锋听了女儿的讲述也有些发懵，眉头微蹙，道：“不应该啊！你已经基本掌握了天罡霸体内蕴护身的操控方式，就算武魂压制，也不应该出现这么大的反应。刚开始的时候不是还没事吗？这个确实有些奇怪，爸爸也不好猜测。你别哭。你的天罡龙武魂肯定是没问题的。问题应该还是在轩宇身上。等爸爸执行完任务回去之后，再详细了解一下。”\n\n    “爸爸，我要赢他啊！你一定要教我一个赢他的办法啊！”叶灵瞳不依的叫着。\n\n    “爸爸马上要开会了。等我回去再说吧。”说完这句话，叶锋就挂断了通讯。\n\n    “团长，到齐了。”一名挂着中尉军衔的军官快步走到叶锋身边，行礼汇报。\n\n    “走，开会。”叶锋脸色一整，此时的他，一身戎装。脸色沉凝。\n\n
