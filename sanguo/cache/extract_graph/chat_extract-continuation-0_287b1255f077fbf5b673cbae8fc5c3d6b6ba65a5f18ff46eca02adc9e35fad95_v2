�时？”懿曰：“四千里之地，往百日，攻百日，还百日，休息六十日，大约一年足矣。”睿曰：“倘吴、蜀入寇，如之奈何？”懿曰：“臣已定下守御之策，陛下勿忧。”睿大喜，即命司马懿兴师征讨公孙渊。\n\n    懿辞朝出城，令胡遵为先锋，引前部兵先到辽东下寨。哨马飞报公孙渊。渊令卑衍，杨祚分八万兵屯于辽隧，围堑二十余里，环绕鹿角，甚是严密。胡遵令人报知司马懿。懿笑曰：“贼不与我战，欲老我兵耳。我料贼众大半在此，其巢穴空虚，不若弃却此处，径奔襄平；贼必往救，却于中途击之，必获全功。”于是勒兵从小路向襄平进发。\n\n    却说卑衍与杨祚商议曰：“若魏兵来攻，休与交战。彼千里而来，粮草不继，难以持久，粮尽必退；待他退时，然后出奇兵击之，司马懿可擒也。昔司马懿与蜀兵相拒，坚守渭南，孔明竟卒于军中：今日正与此理相同。”二人正商议间，忽报：“魏兵往南去了。”卑衍大惊曰：“彼知吾襄平军少，去袭老营也。若襄平有失，我等守此处无益矣。”遂拔寨随后而起。早有探马飞报司马懿。懿笑曰：“中吾计矣！”乃令夏侯霸、夏侯威，各引一军伏于辽水之滨：“如辽兵到，两下齐出。”二人受计而往。早望见卑衍、杨祚引兵前来。一声炮响，两边鼓噪摇旗：左有夏侯霸、右有夏侯威，一齐杀出。卑、杨二人，无心恋战，夺路而走；奔至首山，正逢公孙渊兵到，合兵一处，回马再与魏兵交战。卑衍出马骂曰：“贼将休使诡计！汝敢出战否？”夏侯霸纵马挥刀来迎。战不数合，被夏侯霸一刀斩卑衍于马下，辽兵大乱。霸驱兵掩杀，公孙渊引败兵奔入襄平城去，闭门坚守不出。魏兵四面围合。\n\n    时值秋雨连绵，一月不止，平地水深三尺，运粮船自辽河口直至襄平城下。魏兵皆在水中，行坐不安。左都督裴景入帐告曰：“雨水不住，营中泥泞，军不可停，请移于前面山上。”懿怒曰：“捉公孙渊只在旦夕，安可移营？如有再言移营者斩！”裴景喏喏而退。少顷，右都督仇连又来告曰：“军土苦水，乞太尉移营高处。”懿大怒曰：“吾军令已发，汝何敢故违！”即命推出斩之，悬首于辕门外。于是军心震慑。\n\n
