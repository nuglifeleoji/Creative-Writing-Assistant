She took her hand away from the knife, asked: “Why do you say my brother was destroying himself?”\n“Oh, come now, child! Where are these vaunted powers? Have you no ability to reason?”\nControlling anger, she said: “Reason for me, mentat.”\n“Very well.” He glanced around at their escort, returned his attention to their course. The plain of Arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern rim of the Shield Wall. The pattern of the pan and graben villages remained indistinct beneath a dust pall, but the distant gleam of Arrakeen could be discerned.\n“Symptoms,” he said. “Your brother keeps an official Panegyrist who—”\n“Who was a gift of the Fremen Naibs!”\n“An odd gift from friends,” he said. “Why would they surround him with flattery and servility? Have you really listened to this Panegyrist? ‘The people are illuminated by Muad’Dib. The Umma Regent, our Emperor, came out of darkness to shine resplendently upon all men. He is our Sire. He is precious water from an endless fountain. He spills joy for all the universe to drink,’ Pah!”\nSpeaking softly, Alia said: “If | but repeated your words for our Fremen escort, they’d hack you into bird feed.”\n“Then tell them.”\n“My brother rules by the natural law of heaven!”\n“You don’t believe that, so why say it?”\n“How do you know what | believe?” She experienced trembling that no Bene Gesserit powers could control. This ghola was having an effect she hadn’t anticipated.\n“You commanded me to reason as a mentat,” he reminded her.\n“No mentat knows what | believe!” She took two deep, shuddering breaths. “How dare you judge us?”\n“Judge you? | don’t judge.”\n“You've no idea how we were taught!”\n“Both of you were taught to govern,” he said. “You were conditioned to an overweening thirst for power. You were imbued with a shrewd grasp of politics and a deep understanding for the uses of war and ritual. Natural law? What natural law? That myth haunts human history. Haunts! It’s a ghost. It’s insubstantial, unreal. Is your Jihad a natural law?”\n“Mentat jabber,” she sneered.\n“I’m a servant of the Atreides and | speak with candor,” he said.\n“Servant? We've no servants; only disciples.”\n“And | am a disciple of awareness,” he said. “Understand that, child, and you—”\n“Don’t call me child!” she snapped. She slipped her crysknife half out of its sheath.\n“| stand corrected.” He glanced at her, smiled, returned his attention to piloting the 'thopter. The cliffsided structure of the Atreides Keep could be made out now, dominating the northern suburbs of Arrakeen. “You are something ancient in flesh that is little more than a child,” he said. “And the flesh is disturbed by its new womanhood.”\n“I don’t know why | listen to you,” she growled, but she let the crysknife fall back into its sheath, wiped her palm on her robe. The palm, wet with perspiration, disturbed her\nsense of Fremen frugality. Such a waste of the body’s moisture!\n“You listen because you know I’m devoted to your brother,” he said. “My actions are clear and easily understood.”\n“Nothing about you is clear and easily understood. You’re the most complex creature I’ve ever seen. How do | know what the Tleilaxu built into you?”\n“By mistake or intent,” he said, “they gave me freedom to mold myself.”\n“You retreat into Zensunni parables,” she accused. “The wise man molds himself—the fool lives only to die.” Her voice was heavy with mimicry. “Disciple of awareness!”\n“Men cannot separate means and enlightenment,” he said.\n“You speak riddles!”\n“I speak to the opening mind.”\n“I’m going to repeat all this to Paul.”\n“He’s heard most of it already.”\nShe found herself overwhelmed by curiosity. “How is it you're still alive... and free? What did he say?”\n“He laughed. And he said, ‘People don’t want a bookkeeper for an Emperor; they want a master, someone who'll protect them from change.’ But he agreed that destruction of his Empire arises from himself.”\n“Why would he say such things?”\n“Because | convinced him | understand his problem and will help him.”\n“What could you possibly have said to do that?”\nHe remained silent, banking the ‘thopter into the downwind leg for a landing at the guard complex on the roof of the Keep.\n“| demand you tell me what you said!”\n“I’m not sure you could take it.”\n“I'll be the judge of that! | command you to speak at once!”\n“Permit me to land us first,” he said. And not waiting for her permission, he turned onto the base leg, brought the wings into optimum lift, settled gently onto the bright orange pad atop the roof.\n“Now,” Alia said. “Speak.”\n“I told him that to endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe.”\nShe shook her head. “That’s...that’s...”\n“A bitter pill,” he said, watching the guards run toward them across the roof, taking up their escort positions.\n“Bitter nonsense!”\n“The greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the same problem. You cannot hire a mentat or any other intellect to solve it for you. There’s no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No servant—or disciple—can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see.”\nShe whirled away from him, realizing in the instant of action what this betrayed about her own feelings. Without wile of voice or witch-wrought trickery, he had reached into her psyche once more. How did he do this?\n“What have you told him to do?” she whispered.\n“I told him to judge, to impose order.”\nAlia stared out at the guard, marking how patiently they waited—how orderly. “To dispense justice,” she murmured. “Not that!” he snapped. “I suggested that he judge, no\nmore, guided by one principle, perhaps...”\n“And that?”\n“To keep his friends and destroy his enemies.”\n“To judge unjustly, then.”\n“What is justice? Two forces collide. Each may have the right in his own sphere. And here’s where an Emperor commands orderly solutions. Those collisions he cannot prevent—he solves.”\n“How?”\n“In the simplest way: he decides.”\n“Keeping his friends and destroying his enemies.”\n“Isn't that stability? People want order, this kind or some other. They sit in the prison of their hungers and see that war has become the sport of the rich. That’s a dangerous form of sophistication. It’s disorderly.”\n“I will suggest to my brother that you are much too dangerous and must be destroyed,” she said, turning to face him.\n“A solution I’ve already suggested,” he said.\n“And that’s why you are dangerous,” she said, measuring out her words. “You’ve mastered your passions.”\n“That is not why I’m dangerous.” Before she could move, he leaned across, gripped her chin in one hand, planted his lips on hers.\nIt was a gentle kiss, brief. He pulled away and she stared at him with a shock leavened by glimpses of spasmodic grins on the faces of her guardsmen still standing at orderly attention outside.\nAlia put a finger to her lips. There’d been such a sense of familiarity about that kiss. His lips had been flesh of a future she’d seen in some prescient byway. Breast heaving, she said: “I should have you flayed.”\n“Because I’m dangerous?”\n“Because you presume too much!”\n“| presume nothing. | take nothing which is not first offered to me. Be glad | did not take all that was offered.” He opened his door, slid out. “Come along. We've dallied too long on a fool’s errand.” He strode toward the entrance dome beyond the pad.\nAlia leaped out, ran to match his stride. “lII tell him everything you've said and everything you did,” she said.\n“Good.” He held the door for her.\n“He will order you executed,” she said, slipping into the dome.\n“Why? Because | took the kiss | wanted?” He followed her, his movement forcing her back. The door slid closed behind\nhim.\n“The kiss you wanted!” Outrage filled her.\n“All right, Alia. The kiss you wanted, then.” He started to move around her toward the drop field.\nAs though his movement had propelled her into heightened awareness, she realized his candor—the utter truthfulness of him. The kiss I wanted, she told herself. True.\n“Your truthfulness, that’s what’s dangerous,” she said, following him.\n“You return to the ways of wisdom,” he said, not breaking his stride. “A mentat could not’ve stated the matter more directly. Now: what is it you saw in the desert?”\nShe grabbed his arm, forcing him to a halt. He’d done it again: shocked her mind into sharpened awareness.\n“I can’t explain it,” she said, “but | keep thinking of the Face Dancers. Why is that?”\n“That is why your brother sent you to the desert,” he said, nodding. “Tell him of this persistent thought.”\n“But why?” She shook her head. “Why Face Dancers?”\n“There’s a young woman dead out there,” he said. “Perhaps no young woman is reported missing among the Fremen.”\n| think what a joy it is to be alive, and | wonder if l'Il ever leap inward to the root of this flesh and know myself as once | was. The root is there. Whether any act of mine can find it, that remains tangled in the future. But all things a man can do are mine. Any act of mine may do it.\n—THE GHOLA SPEAKS ALIA’S COMMENTARY\nA? he lay immersed in the screaming odor of the spice, staring inward through the oracular trance, Paul saw the moon become an elongated sphere. It rolled and twisted, hissing—the terrible hissing of a star being quenched in an infinite sea—down...down... down... like a ball thrown by a child.\nIt was gone.\nThis moon had not set. Realization engulfed him. It was gone: no moon. The earth quaked like an animal shaking its Skin. Terror swept over him.\nPaul jerked upright on his pallet, eyes wide open, staring. Part of him looked outward, part inward. Outwardly, he saw the plasmeld grillwork which vented his private room, and he knew he lay beside a stonelike abyss of his Keep. Inwardly, he continued to see the moon fall.\nOut! Out!\nHis grillwork of plasmeld looked onto the blazing light of noon across Arrakeen. Inward—there lay blackest night. A shower of sweet odors from a garden roof nibbled at his senses, but no floral perfume could roll back that fallen moon.\nPaul swung his feet to the cold surface of the floor, peered through the grillwork.
