\n　　省委领导在他的套间里坐下后，张生民先对苗凯说：“本来省委乔书记也要来看你，但今天下午要坐飞机到中央去开会，走前专门吩咐我尽快给你在省医院安排床位，让你安心养病……我已经把床位联系好了，你明天就可以搬进省医院。” \n　　吴斌和石钟也关切地询问他的病情。苗凯只好说他血压最近情况不好，整天头昏脑涨的。 \n　　两位省委书记看来主要是礼节性探望他的病情，因此不谈工作方面的事。 \n　　说闲话的时候，张生民对苗凯说：“黄原办事处还空着一大块地，你们为什么不搞个贸易中心，专门经营黄原特产呢？比如你们那里的红枣、木耳、黄花都很有名……我家都说咱山西人会做生意，你老兄怎忘了咱们的拿手好戏呢？”生民也是山西人，他和苗凯是老乡，也是多年的老熟人。苗凯转而对吴斌和石钟说：“你们两个知道我有多少钱！只要省上给钱，我们就可以盖座贸易大楼，可是我两手空空，拿什么盖楼？” \n　　吴斌开玩笑说：“你山西人都是九毛九！我不信你连这点钱也拿不出来！” \n　　在座的人都哈哈大笑了。 \n　　省委领导临走的时候，石钟才对苗凯说：“关于黄原行署的领导班子，我们考察后，高凤阁同志在干部中意见很大，根据民意测验看，大部分干部都拥护让田福军当专员。省委也认真考虑了你提出的意见。但根据考察的情况，还是决定提拔田福军同志。省委希望你们能很好地配合，使黄原的工作尽快出现好的局面……” \n　　“我完全拥护省委的决定！福军同志是个有能力、有魄力的干部！黄原的工作现在我想让他多管一些。我年纪大了，再说，身体也不太好……” \n　　省委领导们临走时，再一次嘱咐让他好好安心治病。 \n　　第二天，苗凯就住进了省人民医院的高干病房……一个月以后，黄原地委副书记高凤阁借到省里来办事的机会，赶到医院来看望了他。高凤阁不是来汇报的，而是描绘了苗书记离开后这段时间里黄原地区风云变幻的形势。 \n　　高凤阁告诉苗凯，他刚一走，田福军就大刀阔斧地干开了。目前，全区农村正在搞生产责任制，上上下下一片混乱。有的地方已经包产到户，走了资本主义道路，但田福军指示不准拒挡。据他看，大部分县的领导还是不完全按田福军的那一套来。他对苗书记说，不论怎样，黄原整个社会舆论都认为田福军就要当一把手呀，而且都传说苗书记已经免了职，要调回省里…… \n　　“那地区其他领导的态度呢？”苗凯尽量沉\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>苗凯<|>PERSON<|>苗凯 is a local leader who is currently hospitalized and is
