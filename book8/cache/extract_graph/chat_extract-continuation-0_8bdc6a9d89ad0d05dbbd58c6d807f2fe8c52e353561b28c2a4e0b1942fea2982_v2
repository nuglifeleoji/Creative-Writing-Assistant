吕千寻小组、金翔小组，都败在了他们手中。最让老师们看得目瞪口呆的是，怎么看，这两个小组都输得有点冤啊！对于副院长和季洪彬来说，他们却看到了不一样的东西。\n\n    副院长的小眼睛眯起，眼中充满好奇。\n\n    季洪彬则露出了惊讶之色，口中喃喃地念叨着什么。\n\n    和其他老师更注重结果不同，他们看重的是其他的东西。\n\n    从召唤之门中召唤出一个人来?而且明显是有智慧的人，看穿着也是联邦中人，使用的语言也和人类的一样。\n\n    这是从哪里召唤来的?蓝轩宇能够增幅刘锋，这不奇怪，毕竟，武魂之间存在契合的情况，辅助系魂师增幅战斗系魂师的情况也是很常见的。\n\n    可关键是，在被黄金狮子吼影响之后，蓝轩宇发出的那一声龙吟是怎么回事?没有那一声龙吟，他们根本不可能赢下那场战斗。\n\n    可以说，那一声龙吟改变了最终的结局。\n\n    蓝轩宇的魂力只有十四级，那一声龙吟的作用，远远不是他自身的修为所能达到的。\n\n    也就是说，在黄金狮子吼的压迫之下，他自身的血脉爆发出了特殊的力量，才导致了这种情况的出现。\n\n    在黄金狮王的怒吼声中，他依旧展现出不屈的信念，甚至爆发出更强的反击，而且是在双方修为有差距的情况下。\n\n    这意味着，他的武魂很可能比对手的黄金狮王更强。他的武魂，是变异的蓝银草。可是，变异的蓝银草能够拥有超越黄金狮王的能力?这就十分奇特了，他的武魂不仅值得研究，更充满了潜能。\n\n    副院长点了点头，道：“结束考核吧，立刻检查孩子们的身体，看看有没有在考核中受到影响的。\n\n    成绩进行综合评定。”“是。”牧重天赶忙答应一声。事实上，身为高能少年班的班主任，又是当初面试蓝轩宇的负责人，看到蓝轩宇陷入昏迷，牧重天都吓得不行了。\n\n    他最担心的，就是蓝轩宇的身体再出现问题啊！真的是千算万算也算不到会出现这样的变数。\n\n    剩余的三组学员结束考核，所有的模拟舱缓缓开启。牧重天第一时间就来到了蓝轩宇的模拟舱前。\n\n    然后他就看到，脸色有些苍白的蓝轩宇从模拟舱之中坐了起来。他的目光有些茫然，摇了摇头，似乎要摆脱什么。\n\n    “轩宇，轩宇你没事吧？”牧重天的手掌在他面前晃了晃。\n\n    蓝轩宇这才抬头看向他，牧重天顿时捕捉到，在蓝轩宇眼底深处，有一抹金光一闪而过。\n\n    “牧老师，我没事。”蓝轩宇挣扎着从模拟舱中爬出来\n######################\nOutput:",
