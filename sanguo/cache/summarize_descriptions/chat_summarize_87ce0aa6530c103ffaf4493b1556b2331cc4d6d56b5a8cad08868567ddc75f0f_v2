As the central figure of authority, the emperor held the highest position in the imperial court and was pivotal in the political landscape of the time. The emperor's favor was sought by military leaders such as Sima Yi, who aimed to gain support for their endeavors.\n\nIn this context, the emperor is depicted as a figure of significant importance, not only as a ruler but also as a symbol of legitimacy and power. He is protected by loyal subjects, including 杨奉, who are dedicated to ensuring his safety amidst the political chaos.
