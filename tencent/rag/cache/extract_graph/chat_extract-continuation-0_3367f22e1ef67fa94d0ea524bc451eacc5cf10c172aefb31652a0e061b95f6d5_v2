The Oral History does not disagree with the Formal History on important matters.”\n“Then why doesn’t the Worm act against you?”\nShe pointed to the package under Kobat’s arm. “Perhaps the answer is in there.”\n“Or you and these cryptic volumes are no real threat to him!” Kobat was not concealing his anger. He did not like being forced into decisions.\n“Perhaps. Tell me why you mentioned the Oral History.”\nOnce more, Kobat heard the menace.\n“It says the Worm is incapable of human emotions.”\n“That is not the reason,” she said. “You will get one more chance to tell me the reason.”\nNayla moved two steps closer to Kobat.\n“I... Iwas told to review the Oral History before coming here, that your people . . .” He shrugged.\n“That we chant it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Who told you this?”\nKobat swallowed, cast a fearful glance at Topri, then back to Siona.\n“Topri?” Siona asked.\n“I thought it would help him to understand us,” Topri said.\n“And you told him the name of your leader,” Siona said.\n“He already knew!” Topri’s voice had found its squeak.\n“What particular parts of the Oral History were you told to review?” Siona asked.\n“The ... uhhh, the Atreides line.”\n“And now you think you know why people join me in rebellion.”\n“The Oral History tells exactly how he treats everyone in the Atreides line!” Kobat said.\n“He gives us a little rope and then he hauls us in?” Siona asked. Her voice was deceptively flat.\n“That’s what he did with your own father,” Kobat said.\n“And now he’s letting me play at rebellion?”\n“I’m just a messenger,” Kobat said. “If you kill me, who will carry your message?”\n“Or the message of the Worm,” Siona said.\nKobat remained silent.\n“I do not think you understand the Oral History,” Siona said. “I think also you do not Know the Worm very well, nor do you understand his messages.”\nKobat’s face flushed with anger. “What’s to prevent you from becoming like all the rest of the Atreides, a nice obedient part of .. .” Kobat broke off, aware suddenly of what anger had made him Say.\n“Just another recruit for the Worm’s inner circle,” Siona said. “Just like the Duncan Idahos?”\nShe turned and looked at Nayla. The two aides, Anouk and Taw, became suddenly alert, but Nayla remained impassive.\nSiona nodded once to Nayla.\nAs they were sworn to do, Anouk and Taw moved to positions blocking the door. Nayla went around to stand at Topri’s shoulder.\n“What’s ... what's happening?” Topri asked.\n“We wish to know everything of importance that the ex- Ambassador can share with us,” Siona said. “We want the entire message.”\nTopri began to tremble. Perspiration started from Kobat’s forehead. He glanced once at Topri, then returned his attention to Siona. That one glance was like a veil pulled aside for Siona to peer into the relationship between these two.\nShe smiled. This merely confirmed what she had already learned.\nKobat became very still.\n“You may begin,” Siona said.\n“I... what do you...”\n“The Worm gave you a private message for your masters. | will hear it.”\n“He... he wants an extension for his cart.”\n“Then he expects to grow longer. What else?”\n“We are to send him a large supply of ridulian crystal paper.”\n“For what purpose?”\n“He never explains his demands.”\n“This smacks of things he forbids to others,” she said.\nKobat spoke bitterly. “He never forbids himself anything!”\n“Have you made forbidden toys for him?”\n“I do not know.”\nHe’s lying, she thought, but she chose not to pursue this. It was enough to know the existence of another chink in the Worm’s armor.\n“Who will replace you?” Siona asked.\n“They are sending a niece of Malky,” Kobat said. “You may remember that he...”\n“We remember Malky,” she said. “Why does a niece of Malky become the new Ambassador?”\n“I don’t know. But it was ordered even before the Go... the Worm dismissed me.”\n“Her name?”\n“Hwi Noree.”\n“We will cultivate Hwi Noree,” Siona said. “You were not worth cultivating. This Hwi Noree may be something else. When do you return to |x?”\n“Immediately after the Festival, the first Guild ship.”\n“What will you tell your masters?”\n“About what?”\n“My message!”\n“They will do as you ask.”\n“I know. You may go, ex-Ambassador Kobat.”\nKobat almost collided with the door guards in his haste to leave. Topri made to follow him, but Nayla caught Topri’s arm and held him. Topri swept a fearful glance across Nayla’s muscular body, then looked at Siona, who waited for the door to shut behind Kobat before speaking.\n“The message was not merely to the Ixians, but to us as well,” she said. “The Worm challenges us and tells us the rules of the combat.”\nTopri tried to wrest his arm from Nayla’s grip. “What do you...”\n“Topri!” Siona said. “I, too, can send a message. Tell my father to inform the Worm that we accept.”\nNayla released his arm. Topri rubbed the place where she had gripped him. “Surely you don’t...”\n“Leave while you can and never come back,” Siona said.\n“You can’t possibly mean that you sus...”\n“I told you to leave! You are clumsy, Topri. | have been in the Fish Speaker schools for most of my life. They taught me\nto recognize clumsiness.”\n“Kobat is leaving. What harm was there in...”\n“He not only knew me, he knew what | had stolen from the Citadel! But he did not know that | would send that package to Ix with him. Your actions have told me that the Worm wants me to send those volumes to Ix!”\nTopri backed away from Siona toward the door. Anouk and Taw opened a passage for him, swung the door wide. Siona followed him with her voice.\n“Do not argue that it was the Worm who spoke of me and my package to Kobat! The Worm does not send clumsy messages. Tell him | said that!”\nSome say | have no conscience. How false they are, even to themselves. | am the only conscience which has ever existed. As wine retains the perfume of its cask, | retain the essence of my most ancient genesis, and that is the seed of conscience. That is what makes me holy. | am God because | am the only one who really knows his heredity!\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nThe Inquisitors of Ix having assembled in the Grand Palais with the candidate for Ambassador to the Court of the Lord Leto, the following questions and answers were recorded:\nINQUISITOR: You indicate that you wish to speak to us of the Lord Leto’s motives. Speak.\nHWI NOREE: Your Formal Analyses do not satisfy the questions | would raise.\nINQUISITOR: What questions?\nHWI NOREE: | ask myself what would motivate the Lord Leto to accept this hideous transformation, this worm-body, this loss of his humanity? You suggest merely that he did it for power and for long life.\nINQUISITOR: Are those not enough?\nHWI NOREE: Ask yourselves if one of you would make such payment for so paltry a return?\nINQUISITOR: From your infinite wisdom then, tell us why the Lord Leto chose to become a worm.\nHWI NOREE: Does anyone here doubt his ability to predict the future?\nINQUISITOR: Now then! Is that not payment enough for his transformation?\nHWI NOREE: But he already had the prescient ability as did his father before him. No! | propose that he made this desperate choice because he saw in our future something that only such a sacrifice would prevent.\nINQUISITOR: What was this peculiar thing which only he saw in our future?\nHWI NOREE: | do not know, but | propose to discover it.\nINQUISITOR: You make the tyrant appear a selfless servant of the people!\nHWI NOREE: Was that not a prominent characteristic of his Atreides Family?\nINQUISITOR: SO the official histories would have us believe.\nHWI NOREE: The Oral History affirms it.\nINQUISITOR: What other good character would you give to the tyrant Worm?\nHWI NOREE: Good character, sirra?\nINQUISITOR: Character, then?\nHWI NOREE: My Uncle Malky often said that the Lord Leto was given to moods of great tolerance for selected companions.\nINQUISITOR: Other companions he executes for no apparent reason.\nHWI NOREE: | think there are reasons and my Uncle Malky deduced some of those reasons.\nINQUISITOR: Give US One such deduction.\nHWI NOREE: Clumsy threats to his person.\nINQUISITOR: Clumsy threats now!\nHWI NOREE: And he does not tolerate pretensions. Recall the execution of the historians and the destruction of their works.\nINQUISITOR: He does not want the truth known!\nHWI NOREE: He told my Uncle Malky that they lied about the past. And mark you! Who would know this better than he? We all know the subject of his introversion.\nINQUISITOR: What proof have we that all of his ancestors live in him?\nHWI NOREE: | will not enter that bootless argument. | will merely say that | believe it on the evidence of my Uncle Malky’s belief, and his reasons for that belief.\nINQUISITOR: We have read your uncle’s reports and interpret them otherwise. Malky was overly fond of the Worm.\nHWI NOREE: My uncle accounted him the most supremely artful diplomat in the Empire, a master conversationalist and expert in any subject you could name.\nINQUISITOR: Did your uncle not speak of the Worm’s brutality?\nHWI NOREE: My uncle judged him ultimately civilized.\nINQUISITOR: | asked about brutality.\nHWI NOREE: Capable of brutality, yes.\nINQUISITOR: Your uncle feared him.\nHWI NoREE: The Lord Leto lacks all innocence and naiveté. He is to be feared only when he pretends these traits. That was what my uncle said.\nINQUISITOR: Those were his words, yes.\nHWI NOREE: More than that! Malky said, “The Lord Leto delights in the surprising genius and diversity of humankind. He is my favorite companion.”\nINQUISITOR: Giving us the benefit of your supreme wisdom, how do you interpret these words of your uncle?\nHWI NOREE: Do not mock me!\nINQUISITOR: We do not mock. We seek enlightenment.\nHWI NOREE: These words of Malky, and many other things that he wrote directly to me, suggest that the Lord Leto is always seeking after newness and originality but that he is wary of the destructive potential in such things. So my uncle believed.\nINQUISITOR: Is there more which you wish to add to these beliefs which you share with your uncle?\nHWI NOREE: | See no point in adding to what I’ve already said. | am sorry to have wasted the Inquisitors’\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORAL HISTORY<|>EVENT<|>The Oral History is a historical record that
