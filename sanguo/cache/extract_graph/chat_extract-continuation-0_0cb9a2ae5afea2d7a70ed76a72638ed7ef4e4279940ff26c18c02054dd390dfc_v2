�立陈留王，何如？”李儒曰：“今朝廷无主，不就此时行事，迟则有变矣。来日于温明园中，召集百官，谕以废立；有不从者斩之，则威权之行，正在今日。”卓喜。次日大排筵会，遍请公卿。公卿皆惧董卓，谁敢不到。卓待百官到了，然后徐徐到园门下马，带剑入席。酒行数巡，卓教停酒止乐，乃厉声曰：“吾有一言，众官静听。”众皆侧耳。卓曰：“天子为万民之主，无威仪不可以奉宗庙社稷。今上懦弱，不若陈留王聪明好学，可承大位。吾欲废帝，立陈留王，诸大臣以为何如？”诸官听罢，不敢出声。\n\n    座上一人推案直出，立于筵前，大呼：“不可！不可！汝是何人，敢发大语？天子乃先帝嫡子，初无过失，何得妄议废立！汝欲为篡逆耶？”卓视之，乃荆州刺史丁原也。卓怒叱曰：“顺我者生，逆我者死！”遂掣佩剑欲斩丁原。时李儒见丁原背后一人，生得器宇轩昂，威风凛凛，手执方天画戟，怒目而视。李儒急进曰：“今日饮宴之处，不可谈国政；来日向都堂公论未迟。”众人皆劝丁原上马而去。\n\n    卓问百官曰：“吾所言，合公道否？”卢植曰：“明公差矣。昔太甲不明，伊尹放之于桐宫；昌邑王登位方二十七日，造恶三千余条，故霍光告太庙而废之。今上虽幼，聪明仁智，并无分毫过失。公乃外郡刺史，素未参与国政，又无伊、霍之大才，何可强主废立之事？圣人云：有伊尹之志则可，无伊尹之志则篡也。”卓大怒，拔剑向前欲杀植。侍中蔡邕、议郎彭伯谏曰：“卢尚书海内人望，今先害之，恐天下震怖。”卓乃止。司徒王允曰：“废立之事，不可酒后相商，另日再议。”于是百官皆散。卓按剑立于园门，忽见一人跃马持戟，于园门外往来驰骤。卓问李儒：“此何人也？”儒曰：“此丁原义儿：姓吕，名布，字奉先者也。主公且须避之。”卓乃入园潜避。次日，人报丁原引军城外搦战。卓怒，引军同李儒出迎。两阵对圆，只见吕布顶束发金冠，披百花战袍，擐唐猊铠甲，系狮蛮宝带，纵马挺戟，随丁建阳出到阵前。建阳指卓骂曰：“国家不幸，阉官弄权，以致万民涂炭。尔无尺寸之功，焉敢妄言废立，欲乱朝廷！”董卓未及回言，吕布飞马直杀过来。董卓慌走，建阳率军掩杀。卓兵大败，退三十余里下�\n######################\nOutput:",
