As the former imperial house, they held significant political power and influence across the known universe. Following Muad'Dib's rise, the Corrinos became a prominent opposition force against the Atreides, with key members such as **Farad'n** and **Wensicia** actively resisting the new regime. Their legacy reflects both their former dominance as galactic rulers and their subsequent role as adversaries in the shifting power dynamics of the empire.
