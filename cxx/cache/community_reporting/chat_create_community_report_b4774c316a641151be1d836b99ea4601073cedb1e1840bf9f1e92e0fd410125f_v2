The aircraft is currently engaged in a challenging flight over melting ice, highlighting the precarious conditions associated with climate change and its impact on polar regions. 博卡77's unique capabilities make it well-suited for navigating the harsh and dynamic landscapes of the Arctic, where it plays a crucial role in facilitating scientific exploration and data collection in these rapidly changing environments.\",3\r\n18,死星,\"The \"\"死星\"\" (Death Star) is a multifaceted entity that encompasses both a catastrophic event and a cosmic phenomenon, significantly impacting the lives of individuals, particularly children. This event has led to widespread chaos and necessitated the development of survival strategies among those affected. \n\nIn a cosmic context, the \"\"死星\"\" refers to a celestial body that, after illuminating the universe for approximately three hours, abruptly vanished, leaving behind a neutron star. This phenomenon is characterized by intense lightning and atmospheric disturbances, particularly in the polar regions, which contribute to the overall sense of panic and confusion among humanity. \n\nThe term \"\"死星\"\" is also commonly used to describe a supernova, a stellar explosion marking the end of a star's life cycle. Specifically, it denotes a star that has reached the final stages of its evolution, boasting a diameter 23 times that of the Sun and a mass 67 times greater. This immense scale and the dramatic nature of its lifecycle contribute to the fear and disorder experienced by people when such cosmic events occur.\n\nAdditionally, the \"\"死星\"\" is associated with misunderstandings related to bright lights and nuclear attacks, further complicating the public's perception of the event. The sudden appearance of this cosmic phenomenon in the night sky has not only instigated fear but has also led to a broader discourse on the implications of such stellar occurrences on human life and the environment.\n\nIn summary, the \"\"死星\"\" represents a significant cosmic event with profound effects on humanity, characterized by its sudden emergence, the chaos it incites, and its scientific implications as a supernova and a massive star nearing the end of its life cycle.\",15\r\n19,银河系,银河系是一个包含众多恒星和星云的星系，死星的诞生与其中心的辐射扰动有关。,1\r\n20,星际尘埃,星际尘埃是漂浮在宇宙中的微小颗粒，可能由碳微粒组成，影响了死星的光线传播。,1\r\n21,光谱,光谱是通过紫外探测器对星际尘埃进行分析时发现的吸收峰，帮助科学家推测尘埃的组成。,1\r\n22,星云,星云是由气体和尘埃组成的天体，死星的母亲是另一片星云。,1\r\n72,河北平原,河北平原是故事发生的地理位置，描述了事件发生时的环境和景象。,1\r\n85,冰原,冰原是北极地区的自然环境，故事中描述了冰原的状态和变化。,1\r\n24,氦闪,氦闪是死星中心的氦在高温下发生核聚变，产生强光的事件。,2\r\n25,太阳,太阳是一个比死星小得多的普通恒星，受到死星发出的红光影响。,10\r\n26,冥王星,冥王星是被太阳引力抓住的宇宙灰尘之一。,1\r\n27,海王星,海王星是被太阳引力抓住的宇宙灰尘之一。,1\r\n28,天王星,天王星是被太阳引力抓住的宇宙灰尘之一。,1\r\n29,土星,土星是被太阳引力抓住的宇宙灰尘之一。,1\r\n30,木星,木星是被太阳引力抓住的宇宙灰尘之一。,1\r\n33,水星,水星是被太阳引力抓住的宇宙灰尘之一。,1\r\n83,北极,\"The 北极, or Arctic, is a polar region characterized by its extreme weather conditions and unique ecological features.
