The Harkonnens held Yueh’s wife. He hated the Harkonnens! | cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the carnage?”\nShe is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a shock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.\n“Do not try to forgive me,” Yueh had written. “I do not want your forgiveness. | already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without malice or hope of another’s understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my ultimate test. | give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that | write truly. By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead. Take consolation from my assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with him.”\nIt had not been addressed or signed, but there’d been no mistaking the familiar scrawl—Yueh’s.\nRemembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment—a thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mental alertness. He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words, but had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.\n| loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. / should mourn him. | should feel something.\nBut he felt nothing except: Here’s an important fact.\nIt was one with all the other facts.\nAll the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating, computing.\nHalleck’s words came back to Paul: “Mood’s a thing for cattle or for making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood.”\nPerhaps that’s it, Paul thought. /’// mourn my father later...when there’s time.\nBut he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that his new awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing. The sense of terrible purpose he’d first experienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam pervaded him. His right hand—the hand of remembered pain— tingled and throbbed.\nIs this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.\n“For a while, | thought Hawat had failed us again,” Jessica said. “I thought perhaps Yueh wasn’t a Suk doctor.”\n“He was everything we thought him...and more,” Paul said. And he thought: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, “If Idaho doesn’t get through to Kynes, we'll be—”\n“He’s not our only hope,” she said.\n“Such was not my suggestion,” he said.\nShe heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across the gray darkness of the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette against moon- frosted rocks seen through the tent’s transparent end.\n“Others among your father’s men will have escaped,” she said. “We must regather them, find—” “We will depend upon ourselves,” he said. “Our immediate concern is our family atomics. We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them\nout.”\n“Not likely they'll be found,” she said, “the way they were hidden.”\n“It must not be left to chance.”\nAnd she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet and its spice—that’s what he has in mind. But all he can hope for then is escape into renegade anonymity.\nHis mother’s words had provoked another train of thought in Paul—a duke’s concern for all the people they’d lost this night. People are the true strength of a Great House, Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat’s words: “Parting with people is a sadness; a place is only a place.”\n“They’re using Sardaukar,” Jessica said. “We must wait until the Sardaukar have been withdrawn.”\n“They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar,” Paul said. “They intend that there be no Atreides survivors—total extermination. Do not count on any of our people escaping.”\n“They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperor's part in this.”\n“Can't they?”\n“Some of our people are bound to escape.”\n“Are they?”\nJessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son’s voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did. She had helped train the intelligence which did this, but now she found herself fearful of it. Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.\nThis is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought. “A time of love and a time of grief.” She rested her hand\non her abdomen, awareness focused on the embryo there. / have the Atreides daughter | was ordered to produce, but the Reverend Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldn’t have saved my Leto. This child ts only life reaching for the future in the midst of death. I conceived out of instinct and not out of obedience.\n“Try the communinet receiver again,” Paul said.\nThe mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.\nJessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch. A green light glowed on the instrument’s face. Tinny screeching came from its speaker. She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands. A voice speaking Atreides battle language came into the tent.\n“...back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no Survivors in Carthag and the Guild Bank has been sacked.”\nCarthag! Jessica thought. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.\n“They’re Sardaukar,” the voice said. “Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides uniforms. They’re....”\nA roaring filled the speaker, then silence.\n“Try the other bands,” Paul said.\n“Do you realize what that means?” Jessica asked.\n“I expected it. They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their bank. With the Guild against us, we’re trapped on Arrakis. Try the other bands.”\nShe weighed his words: / expected it. What had happened to him? Slowly, Jessica returned to the instrument. As she moved the bandslide, they caught glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in\nmod\nAtreides battle language: “...fall back.... regroup at....” “...trapped in a cave at....”\nAnd there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen gibberish that poured from the other bands. Sharp commands, battle reports. There wasn’t enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but the tone was obvious.\nHarkonnen victory.\nPaul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle there. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His left hand felt the sphincter-seal of the tent’s entrance. “It’ll be dawn soon,” he said. “We can wait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night. In the desert, you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day.”\nRemembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica’s mind: Without a stillsuit, a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to maintain body weight. She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.\n“If we leave here, Idaho can’t find us,” she said.\n“There are ways to make any man talk,” he said. “If Idaho hasn’t returned by dawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured. How long do you think he could hold out?”\nThe question required no answer, and she sat in silence.\n„try to\nPaul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab and magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages: “literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit repkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt-plugs, paracompass, maker hooks, thumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar....”\nSo many things for survival on the desert.\nPresently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor.\n“Where can we possibly go?” Jessica asked.\n“My father spoke of desert power,” Paul said. “The Harkonnens cannot rule this planet without it. They’ve never ruled this planet, nor shall they. Not even with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar.”\n“Paul, you can’t think that—”\n“We've all the evidence in our hands,” he said. “Right here in this tent—the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites. We know that—”\n“What’ve weather satellites to do with it?” she asked. “They couldn’t possibly....” She broke off.\nPaul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing on minutiae. “You see it now,” he said. “Satellites watch the terrain below. There are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection.”\n“You're suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?”\nShe was so slow.\n“No!” he said. “The Fremen! They’re paying the Guild for privacy, paying in a coin that’s freely available to anyone with desert power—spice. This is more than a second-approximation answer; it’s the Straight-line computation. Depend on it.”\n“Paul,” Jessica said, “you're not a Mentat yet; you can’t know for sure how—”\n“I'll never be a Mentat,” he said. “I’m something else...a freak.”\n“Paul! How can you say such—”\n“Leave me alone!”\nHe turned away from her, looking out into the night. Why can’t I mourn? he wondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it would be denied him forever.\nJessica had never heard such distress tn her son’s voice. She wanted to reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him—but she sensed there was nothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.\nThe glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught her eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: “Manual of ‘The Friendly Desert,’ the place full of life. Here are the ayat and burhan of Life. Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you.”\nIt reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?\nPaul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: “Think of all these special- application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled\nsophistication. Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected.”\nHesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: “Muad’Dib: The Mouse,” and noted that the tail pointed north.\nPaul stared into the tent’s darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his mother revealed by the manual’s glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my father’s wish, he thought. / must\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is the son of Duke Leto Atreides and Jessica, showing signs of emerging powers and leadership qualities.
