They are deeply involved in the creation of gholas—cloned individuals with restored memories—and wield significant control over the production of melange, the invaluable spice central to the political and economic power structures of their universe. Currently, the Bene Tleilaxu are engaged in negotiations with the Bene Gesserit, another powerful and enigmatic group, though the exact nature of these discussions remains undisclosed.

He is deeply involved in negotiations, alliances, and espionage, particularly with the Bene Gesserit, the Honored Matres, and other factions like the Fish Speakers and Ixians. A cunning strategist, Waff demonstrates both religious fanaticism and shrewd political maneuvering, often balancing suspicion of others with his own long-term ambitions for Tleilaxu ascendancy.  \n\nWaff accompanies Bene Gesserit leaders like Odrade and Sheeana on critical missions, including a desert venture on Rakis, where he represents Tleilaxu interests in a triumvirate. His interactions with Odrade are marked by tension, as he both reveals and conceals information about Tleilaxu practices, wary of Bene Gesserit manipulation.
