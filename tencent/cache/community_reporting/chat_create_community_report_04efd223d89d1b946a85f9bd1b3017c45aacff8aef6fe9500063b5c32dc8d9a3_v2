He collaborates with Felix to devise a strategy for his escape, indicating a level of trust and partnership between them. This involvement suggests that the Turkish merchant is not only concerned with his own interests but also with the well-being and future of Felix.\n\nAdditionally, the Turkish merchant is revealed to be the father of Shafi. He has intentions to return to Turkey and has issued a directive to his daughter, instructing her to cease any thoughts of Felix. This command highlights the merchant's protective nature towards Shafi and his desire to distance her from Felix, possibly due to concerns about the implications of their relationship or the dangers associated with Felix's situation.\n\nIn summary, the Turkish merchant plays a dual role in the story: he is both a facilitator of Felix's escape and a father who seeks to guide his daughter away from a potentially tumultuous relationship.
