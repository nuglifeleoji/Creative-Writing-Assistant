却说李傕之军，大半是西凉人氏，更赖羌兵为助。却被皇甫郦扬言于西凉人曰：“李傕谋反，从之者即为贼党，后患不浅。”西凉人多有听郦之言，军心渐涣。傕闻郦言，大怒，差虎贲王昌追之。昌知郦乃忠义之士，竟不往追，只回报曰：“郦已不知何往矣。”贾诩又密谕羌人曰：“天子知汝等忠义，久战劳苦，密诏使汝还郡，后当有重赏。”羌人正怨李傕不与爵赏，遂听诩言，都引兵去。诩又密奏帝曰：“李傕贪而无谋，今兵散心怯，可以重爵饵之。”帝乃降诏，封傕为大司马。傕喜曰：“此女巫降神祈祷之力也！”遂重赏女巫，却不赏军将。骑都尉杨奉大怒，谓宋果曰：“吾等出生入死，身冒矢石，功反不及女巫耶！”宋果曰：“何不杀此贼，以救天子？”奉曰：“你于中军放火为号，吾当引兵外应。”二人约定是夜二更时分举事。不料其事不密，有人报知李傕。傕大怒，令人擒宋果先杀之。杨奉引兵在外，不见号火。李傕自将兵出，恰遇杨奉，就寨中混战到四更。奉不胜，引军投西安去了。李傕自此军势渐衰。更兼郭汜常来攻击，杀死者甚多。忽人来报：“张济统领大军，自陕西来到，欲与二公解和；声言如不从者，引兵击之。”傕便卖个人情，先遣人赴张济军中许和。郭汜亦只得许诺。张济上表，请天子驾幸弘农。帝喜曰：“朕思东都久矣。今乘此得还，乃万幸也！”诏封张济为骠骑将军。济进粮食酒肉，供给百官。汜放公卿出营。傕收拾车驾东行，遣旧有御林军数百，持戟护送。\n\n
