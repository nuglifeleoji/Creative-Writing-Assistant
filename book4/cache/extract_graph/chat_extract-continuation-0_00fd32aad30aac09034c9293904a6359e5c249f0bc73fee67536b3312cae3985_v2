\n　　接连问了几家旅社，都已经客满了。孙少安这才有点紧张起来。啊呀，大地方的确不是土包子来的，有钱连个住处也找不到！ \n　　孙少安惊惶失措地从黄原街上走过来，一直都快到北关，还没找到个住的地方。 \n　　他无意中瞥见了“黄原宾馆”的牌子。他知道这是个高级地方，不知道老百姓能不能住？ \n　　因为再没有其它办法，少安就冒出个颇有气魄的念头：干脆到“黄原宾馆”去碰碰运气！ \n　　他于是鼓足勇气，心“咚咚”地跳弹着，走进了这个富丽堂皇的“宫殿”。 \n　　孙少安运气不错！“黄原宾馆”最近会议不多，接待零散客人。 \n　　“我住旅社……”他胆怯地走到登记室的柜台前，结结巴巴对里面一位“办公”的姑娘说。 \n　　“旅社”二字显然使搞登记的姑娘好奇地抬起头来，瞟了他一眼。 \n　　那姑娘问：“几个人？” \n　　“就我一个。”少安陪着笑脸说。 \n　　姑娘一边开票，一边说：“证件。” \n　　“证件？”少安吃惊地问。 \n　　那姑娘抬起头来，停止了开票，说：“你是哪儿的？什么单位？” \n　　“我是个农民，来这里找我弟弟，因此没证……件。”他老老实实说。 \n　　这姑娘看出他不是撒谎，又问：“那你带着介绍信吗？” \n　　去他的！走时都忘记在田海民那里开个介绍信了。他只好又照实说：“我走得忙，忘记在队里开介绍信了。”“按规定，没介绍信我们不能让你住。”那姑娘把笔搁在了一边。 \n　　“啊呀，好同志哩！我这是初出远门，人生地不熟，一条街走过来也没找下个住处，你就行行好，让我住一晚上……”少安可怜巴巴地央求这位搞登记的姑娘。 \n　　那姑娘看他这么恳切，犹豫了一下，就把票开了，说：“那你明天得另找地方去住。交十八元钱。” \n　　我的天！住一晚上就得十八块？ \n　　如果原来知道贵得这么惊人，那他宁愿在街上蹲一夜也不来这里！ \n　　但现在他不好再退缩了。人家“破例”让你住，你再不识抬举，那就不象话了。 \n　　去他的！男子汉大丈夫，不能说熊话，十八块就十八块！ \n　　少安于是很有气魄地解开外衣，从贴身衬衣的口袋上取下别着的领针，掏出两张硬铮铮的“大团结”，递给了开票的姑娘。 \n　　办完手续后，他根据发票上的房号，上了中楼第三层。 \n　　服务员把票据和他本人反复打量了半天，才把他引到了房间里。 \n　　少安进得房间来\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
