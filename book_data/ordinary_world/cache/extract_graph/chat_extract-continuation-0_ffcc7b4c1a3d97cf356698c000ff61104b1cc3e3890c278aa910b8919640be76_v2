现最动摇的小伙子手里塞。这人犹豫了一下，把烟接住，很快装进了自己的衣袋里——现在不敢抽，等到歇工时，谁能知道这烟是他的还是王满银的？另外两个一看这个已当了“叛徒”，他们也照样做了。当然，满银没敢给老丈人。他看见老丈人狠狠瞪了他一眼。王满银也不在乎，心想：瞪什么眼哩？你老人家没看见，你这个女婿精能着哩！这时候，孙玉厚已经痛苦得有些麻木了。 \n　　当知道不成器的女婿被拉到工地上“劳教”，并且污辱性地让他来给王满银装土的时候，孙玉厚老汉恨这地上为什么不马上裂开一条缝，让他钻进去呢？他在这个世界上已经活够了。从一生下到现在，五十二年来，他没有过几天快活日子。他之所以还活着，不是指望自己今生一世享什么福，而完全是为了自己的几个子女。只要儿女们能活得好一些，他受罪一辈子也心甘情愿。他是个没本事的农民，不可能让孩子们在这世界上生活得更体面。他只是拼老命挣扎，让后人们象一般庄稼人那样不缺吃少穿就心满意足了。但是，这年头，他在这土地上都快把自己的血汗洒干了，家里的光景还是象筛子一样到处是窟窿眼。两个小点的娃娃硬撑着上学，烂衣薄裳，少吃没喝，在学堂里遭白眼，受委屈。大儿子本来是念书的好材料，结果初中也没上，十三岁就回来受了苦，帮扶他支撑这个家。儿子算算已经二十三岁了，还没个媳妇——象他这样的农村青年，大部分都已经娶过家了。但他拿什么给孩子娶呢？现在娶个媳妇，尽管公家反对出财礼，哪个又能少了千二八百？唉，话说回来，人家养大一个女儿也不容易，千二八百又算个什么！谁家的女儿能象他的兰花一样，白白扔给了二流子！当然，话又说回来，这样一笔娶亲钱对他来说，大得简直太可怕了！另外，就是能娶回来个媳妇，又往哪里住呢？全家一眼土窑，他老两口和快八十岁的老母亲住着；少安就在窑旁边戳了个小土窝窝安身。两个念书娃娃星期六回来，只好到河对面金俊海家里借宿。没力气再打几孔土窑洞啊！本来他家占有一块多好的崖势——米家镇的米阴阳当年在罗盘上看过这地方，说土脉、风水，都是双水村最好的！可是少安当个生产队长，没什么空子。如果父子俩因为打窑误了冬工，一年下来又要出粮钱。再说，就是钻下两个土洞子，做门窗的钱又从哪里来？这穷山穷水长不起来树，木料贵得怕\n######################\nOutput:",
