Their positioning and tactics are designed to surprise and overwhelm the enemy, which can lead to decisive victories in military engagements. The effectiveness of these hidden troops relies heavily on their ability to remain undetected until the moment of attack, thereby maximizing the element of surprise. This strategy has historical significance, as it has been employed in various conflicts to turn the tide in favor of the ambushing forces. The relationship between 伏兵 and 城上 highlights the strategic importance of location in executing ambushes, as the city walls provide a vantage point for planning and executing military actions.
