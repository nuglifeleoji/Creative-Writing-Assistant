A Jewish woman from Gammu, she temporarily evaded capture by Dama's forces but later found herself interrogated by the Great Honored Matre, demonstrating her knowledge of Truthsay and the Bene Gesserit. She was mated to a Truthsayer named Shoel, further tying her to these traditions.  \n\nHaving undergone the Agony, Rebecca is a wild Reverend Mother, marked by spice-addicted eyes and endowed with Bene Gesserit Other Memory. She carries the knowledge of Lampadas and its Reverend Mothers, and she shares her memories—often painful truths—with others, including Lucilla and the Rabbi. Her interactions with the Rabbi and Joshua reveal her as a leader or key figure within her community, deeply concerned with their well-being and future. She engages in philosophical reflections, defending the Sisterhood's actions and beliefs, particularly regarding governance and the leveling drift.  \n\nRebecca is a member of a hidden Jewish group with Bene Gesserit awareness, providing guidance and bridging the two traditions.
