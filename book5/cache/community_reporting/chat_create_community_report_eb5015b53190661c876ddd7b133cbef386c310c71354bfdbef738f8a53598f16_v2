This personal tragedy adds a layer of complexity to his narrative, intertwining his professional struggles with his familial connections.\n\nOverall, 叶哲泰's life and career are marked by his unwavering dedication to his scientific principles, his role as an educator, and the personal sacrifices he has made amidst a backdrop of political turmoil and ideological conflict.\",8\r\n5,红卫兵,\"The Red Guards, known in Chinese as 红卫兵, were a mass student-led paramilitary social movement that emerged during the Cultural Revolution in China, which lasted from 1966 to 1976. This group was characterized by its fervent revolutionary zeal and radical ideology, as well as its active involvement in political and ideological struggles during a tumultuous period in Chinese history.\n\nThe Red Guards were primarily composed of young revolutionaries who passionately criticized and denounced perceived bourgeois elements within society. They were known for their fervent political activism, which included the public denunciation and persecution of intellectuals and those deemed counter-revolutionary. This often manifested in violent actions and campaigns against individuals who were seen as enemies of the state or as representatives of the \"\"Four Olds\"\" (old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas).\n\nThe movement was marked by its radical actions, which included the mobilization of students to challenge authority and traditional societal norms. The Red Guards played a significant role in the Cultural Revolution, as they sought to enforce Mao Zedong's vision of a classless society and to eliminate any opposition to the Communist Party's ideology. Their activities contributed to widespread chaos and upheaval across China, leading to significant social and political changes.\n\nOverall, the Red Guards were emblematic of the intense ideological fervor of the Cultural Revolution, representing a generation of youth deeply engaged in the revolutionary cause and willing to take extreme measures to achieve their goals.
