This organization is dedicated to the transformation of human civilization through the influence of the Trisolaran civilization, which originates from the science fiction series \"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin. Members of the Earth Trisolaris Organization are spread across various countries, united by their common goal of facilitating the intervention of the Trisolaran civilization in human affairs.\n\nThe organization’s primary objective is to advocate for the reformation of humanity under the guidance of the Trisolaran civilization, which they believe possesses superior knowledge and capabilities.
