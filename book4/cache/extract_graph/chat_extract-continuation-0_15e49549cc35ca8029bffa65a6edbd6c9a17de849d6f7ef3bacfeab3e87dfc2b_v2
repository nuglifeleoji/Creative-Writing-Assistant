方建起来，心里一直很难过。现在，少平已经把箍窑的钱攒得差不多了，我们怎能拿这钱办砖场呢？爸爸，你把钱拿回去。我欠缺的，由我来想办法。再说，我们不言不传用了这钱，也对不起少平……” \n　　“少平已经回了信，叫你们用去。还说有困难，叫你们给他写信，他还可以在煤矿给你们转借……”玉厚老汉把钱拿起来，揭开对面的小木匣，给他们放了进去。 \n　　少安背过脸，久久地站立着没有说话，眼里不由旋转起两团泪水。他深深地感激亲爱的父亲和弟弟，秀莲也在锅台那边用围裙揩眼泪。他们再一次感受到了骨肉深情；同时为有少平这样强有力的弟弟而无比骄傲！是呀，有什么必要灰心丧气呢？孙家有的是力量！他们还有一个让整个东拉河流域都羡慕的妹妹——她正在中国最“高级”的学堂里念书哩！孙少安立刻感到身体轻盈得象能飞翔一般。他马不停蹄，调头向北，到米家镇去打问先前给他烧过砖的河南师傅。 \n　　他很快知道了这个人的下落——就在镇子北头的那个村子里。 \n　　在穿过米家镇红火热闹的集市时，他还没忘了到那个铁匠铺的门口停留了片刻。那年他给队里的牲口治病，晚上没个住处，曾在这铁匠铺过了一夜——也是一个好心的河南师傅让他在这里留宿的。铁匠铺仍然锤声叮当，火花飞溅，但不再是当年那两位师傅了。 \n　　孙少安穿过街道，在那个村子里很快就找到了他原来的烧砖师傅。巧的是，这师傅正好要在这里结工。但不巧的是，他准备拾掇着回河南老家去呀。孙少安几乎央告着求他，让他再为自己帮一段忙；哪怕几个月都行。他为了打动师傅，还详细给他叙说了他近一年来的悲惨遭遇。 \n　　这位河南人终于被他说动了心，跟着他返回了双水村。 \n　　孙少安接着又跑到石圪节街上，雇用了外村的几个农民来当小工。本村人他不敢再雇用，而且眼下也没人再来为他干活——干过活的工钱到现在还都欠着哩！ \n　　秋天的一个下午，双水村南头又响起了制砖机轰隆隆的吼叫声——这声音已经整整沉寂了一年。 \n　　双水村的人再一次被震惊了！谁能想到，滚到黑水沟里的孙少安怎又爬蜒起来呢？ \n　　是的，他又站起来了。尽管他已碰得头破血流，却再一次挣扎着迈开脚步，重新踏上了创业的征程。人，常常是脆弱的；但人又是最顽强的！ \n　　十天之后，第一批砖窑开始点火。 \n　　滚\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
