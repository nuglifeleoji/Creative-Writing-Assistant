封匿名信，告他抗拒地委的决定，竟然在南马河公社不学习“哈尔套经验”，不搞“社会主义大集”；说这公社的自由市场不但依然如故，而且更加变本加厉；资本主义活动现在到处泛滥。这封信断然下结论说，这个公社已经变成地地道道的“资本主义王国”了，而这个“王国”的“国王”就是冯国斌。 \n　　地委在接信的第二天就派出了工作组，没给县委打招呼就驾临南马河公社。正好当天南马河逢集，立即印证了匿名信所说的情况。工作组立即代表地委命令冯国斌停职检查，然后才把这个决定通知了县委。 \n　　“黑煞神”才不尿这一套哩！他的老脾气是错了也只在沉默中改正；何况他认为这事并没有做错，凭什么要他在大会上作检查呢？ \n　　在工作组召集的全公社干部大会上，他既不检查，也不辩解；一言不发，只是一锅又一锅地抽他的旱烟。工作组对他实在没办法，只好回地委汇报去了。 \n　　停了他的职，他毫不在乎。饭量比以往更大了，睡觉照样咎声如雷。他每天打着工具，去参加南马河大队的劳动。对于公社的事他一样也不少管。他还是这里的当家人！ \n　　就在这个当口，他又听说了关于吴月琴的一件事，还是杨立孝告诉他的。杨立孝说，吴月琴最近越来越不像话了，竟然和南马河三队的队长运生搞不正当关系；现在全公社到处都在风一股雨一股地议论，影响坏极了。 \n　　冯国斌听了这话感到非常震惊。本来，通过上次谈话，这个女孩子的形象在他的脑子里已经有所改变，尤其是她的那种不屈服的性格给他留下了满不错的印象。尽管他没明说，但他喜欢她的这一点。想不到现在又发生了这等歪事！ \n　　现在，他隐隐约约感觉到。他以前对这个女孩子关心不够。何止是关心不够！他实际上从来就没关心过她。他现在才认真地考虑到，生活在他所领导的土地上的这个女青年，遭遇和处境是多么不幸啊！她什么依靠也没有；有那么多的本事和特长，又哪里也去不了，多少年来就屈在这个乡山圪劳里；二十大几的人，根本没法考虑较满意的婚烟。如此险恶的遭遇和鸽运，难道不能逼得一个人堕落吗？他想，如果这个女孩子真的堕落了，实际上他也有责任。他以前是有可能帮助她一点什么的，但他没有这样做。想到自己对一个不幸的人这样不关心，他难受极了。所以，尽管他目前的处境也不佳，但还是准备和她谈一次话。这次他不准备叫她到公社来，他要亲自找上她的门去谈，这也包含了一种对不种她的意思。
