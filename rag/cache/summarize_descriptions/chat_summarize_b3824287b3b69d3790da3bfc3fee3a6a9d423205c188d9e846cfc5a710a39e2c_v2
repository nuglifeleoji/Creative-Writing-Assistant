These immense creatures are both destructive and unpredictable, embodying the harsh and untamed nature of the desert world.

While the term \"Shaitan\" broadly refers to the sandworms as a whole, it also carries a dual meaningâ€”representing both the awe-inspiring power of these beasts and their role as formidable, almost mythical entities in the lives of the desert inhabitants.
