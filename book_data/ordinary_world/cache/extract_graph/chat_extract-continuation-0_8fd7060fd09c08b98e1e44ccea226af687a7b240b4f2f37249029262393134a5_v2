�绸带的黄吉普车正等待新娘的到来。本来县革委会商县招待所只有几百米远，但为了排场，李登云动用了全县所有三辆吉普车中的两辆——当时吉普车就是县上最高级的车，准备专车把新娘新郎接到招待所。 \n　　现在，李向前穿一身崭新的银灰色的卡制服，皮鞋擦得能照见人影子，胸前戴着一朵大红花，正喜气洋洋坐在吉普车的后座上。这位司机今天不用开车，自在地坐在小车里面，胖胖的脸上带着幸福的微笑。 \n　　这时，在县招待所的大餐厅里，已经是一片热闹非凡的景象了。几十张大圆桌铺上了干净雪白的台布，每张圆桌上都摆满了瓜子、核桃、红枣、苹果、梨、纸烟和茶水。早到的客人已经十人一桌，围成一圈，吃水果，嗑瓜子，抽纸烟，喝茶水，拉闲话。说话声和笑声嗡嗡地响成一片。这些县社干部们，今天不见明天见，相互之间都是熟人，凑到一起就有许多话可说。 \n　　这期间，仍然有新到的客人从餐厅门口走了进来。李登云两口子衣冠楚楚，分别立在大门两边，脸上堆着笑容，和进来的客人热情握手，表示欢迎光临他们儿子的婚礼。招待所的院子里停了许多汽车——这是向前的司机朋友们前来参加婚礼；他们有的是本县的，有的是从外地赶来的。不时还有一辆大型拖拉机震耳欲聋般吼叫着开了进来，从驾驶楼里跳下来一些公社的负责人——他们的专车就是这大型拖拉机。 \n　　在餐厅后面的厨房里，十几个炊事员正忙着准备婚礼上的酒菜和饭菜。全县几个著名的厨师都被请来了，其中有石圪节食堂的胖炉头胡得福——胡师有几个拿手菜名扬全县，尤其是红烧肘子。 \n　　人已经越来越多了，站在门口迎接宾客的李登云夫妇惊慌地发现，除过主宾席外，几十张圆桌已经快挤满了人，而客人到现在还没有来完呢！李登云一边对进来的客人满面笑容地说一声“欢迎”的时候，头上就渗出几粒冷汗——把人家“欢迎”进去让坐在哪儿呢？ \n　　就在这时候，被邀请来参加婚礼的石圪节公社主任白明川发现了李主任面临的尴尬局面。他站起来，把旁边他们公社的文书、润叶的同学刘根民拉上，又叫了田福堂的小子润生，到后面的房间里拉出一些椅子来，给每一张圆桌前又加了一把，立刻就把问题解决了。李登云看见了，马上松了一口气，心里说，这小伙子脑子就是好！倒说田福军那么器重地。本来，他\n######################\nOutput:",
