��着——他身上的伤已经够多了……在风门口，雷汉义自己背起了王世才，他叫几个人跟他上井，然后打发少平和其余的人都回掌子面继续干活。区长的话就是不容违抗的命令。 \n　　是的，生产不能停——这就是煤矿！ \n　　安锁子不服从区长的决定，非要护送师傅上井不行。 \n　　雷汉义对安锁子说：“你它妈的吊着锤子怎上去？”这时，大家和安锁子本人都才发现，他连裤子也没穿，还光着屁股。 \n　　当师傅的尸体在井口的报警铃声中升上地面的时候，他刚刚淌过血的掌子面上，煤溜子又隆隆价转动了…… \n                  第18章\n　　对于煤矿来说，死人是常有的事。这不会引起过份的震动，更不会使生产和生活的节奏有半点停顿。 \n　　当医院后边的山坡上又堆起一座新坟的时候，大牙湾的一切依然在轰隆隆地进行。煤溜子滚滚不息地转动，运煤车喧吼着驶向远方；夜晚，一片片灯火照样灿若星海……王世才却和这个世界永别了。不久，青草就会埋住他的坟头，这个普通人的名字也会在人们的记忆中消失。 \n　　只是他近二十年间的劳动所创造的财富。依然会在这个世界上无形地存在；他挖出的煤所变成的力量永远不会在活人的生活里消失。 \n　　我们承认伟人在历史过程中的贡献。可人类生活的大厦从本质上说，是由无数普通人的血汗乃至生命所建造的。伟人们常常企图用纪念碑或纪念堂来使自己永世流芳。真正万古长青的却是普通人的无人纪念碑——生生不息的人类生活自身。是的，生活之树常青。 \n　　这就是我们对一个平凡世界的死者所能做的祭文。 \n　　一个普通人的消失对世界来说，的确象什么事也没有发生。 \n　　可是，对大牙湾煤矿黑户区这个小院落来说，这似乎就是世界的末日。我们知道，这里曾有过一个多么温暖而幸福的家。现在，妻子失去了丈夫，儿子没有了父亲。他们的太阳永远殒落了…… \n　　几天来，不幸的惠英一直在床上躺着。 \n　　直到现在，她还不相信丈夫已经死了。她披头散发，两只眼睛象蜂蛰了那般红肿。即是风摇动一下门环，她也要疯狂地跳下床，看是不是丈夫回来了？面对空荡荡的院落，她只能伏在门框上大哭一场。可怜的明明抱着她的腿，跟她一起啼哭。 \n　　她自己水米难咽，但总得要给孩子吃饭。 \n　　饭桌上，她象往日一样把丈夫的筷子和酒杯给他摆好。这是一种无望的期待。但她又相信，丈夫一定会象过去那样罗着�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>雷汉义<|>PERSON<|>雷汉义 is a character who
