“找我干什么？”蓝轩宇有些好奇的问道。\n\n    叶灵瞳抿了抿红唇，“我是来告诉你，我一定会找到击败你的办法的。一定会赢你的。”\n\n    蓝轩宇眉头皱了皱，“哦。还有别的事吗？没有我就走了。”\n\n    叶灵瞳似乎是有些生气了，“你怎么也不问问我这几个月去哪里了？你这人真讨厌。”\n\n    蓝轩宇没好气的道：“咱们俩是谁讨厌啊？每次都是你来招惹我。你才讨厌呢。你去哪里了和我有什么关系。我要回家了。”说完，他转身就走了。\n\n    看着他大步离开的背影，叶灵瞳突然鼻子一酸，眼泪就流了下来。这几个月，她真的好不开心啊！\n\n    她其实哪里都没去，一直都在家里，家里还来了许多外人，说是要保护她和妈妈的安全。可这几个月来，爸爸却一直都没回来。\n\n    直到昨天，这个所谓的“保护”才结束。爸爸也终于回来了。可是，从叶锋的脸上，她看到了深深的疲惫。\n\n    更重要的是，爸爸肩膀上的肩章变了，原本的四个星星变成了三个。她不知道发生了什么，只是看到妈妈搂着爸爸一个劲的哭。\n\n    今天，她终于可以来到学院了，她自己都不明白是为什么，第一时间就来找蓝轩宇。就说了那样的话。潜意识中，她只是想要找一个倾诉的对象，向他说说自己这几个月来有多么不开心。可是，倔强的性格却依旧让她说出了要击败他的话，然后，那个家伙、那个家伙竟然就这么走了。我就那么讨厌的吗？\n\n    如果让蓝轩宇听到叶灵瞳的疑问，那他一定会毫不犹豫的回答她：是的。\n\n    他确实是不喜欢叶灵瞳的，准确的说，他就不喜欢性格强势的人。\n\n    无论是蓝潇、南澄，甚至是娜娜老师，每个人都对他很温和。和他们在一起，蓝轩宇就特别开心。无疑，叶灵瞳是与众不同的，可是，蓝轩宇却并不欣赏这种与众不同啊！\n\n    “蓝轩宇，你给我等着！我跟你没完！”\n\n    “灵瞳，你总算回来了。家里一切都好吗？对了，有件事情龚老师要告诉你，下个学期啊！本校要开一个高能少年班……，名额十分有限，我听说，一班报了蓝轩宇……”\n\n    蓝轩宇并不知道，自己在不知不觉间再次树敌，而且，还是叶灵瞳这个从未战胜过他，却明明比他强的对手。\n\n    “妈妈，我回来啦！”蓝轩宇一进门就习惯叫了起来。今天是南澄的休息日，应该是在家的。\n\n
