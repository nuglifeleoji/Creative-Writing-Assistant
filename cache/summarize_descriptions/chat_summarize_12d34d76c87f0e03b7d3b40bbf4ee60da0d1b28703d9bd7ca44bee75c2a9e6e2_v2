Their role extended beyond mere soldiers; they were instrumental in maintaining the God Emperor's authority through both force and ceremonial practices. Though their prominence was tied to Leto II's rule, their legacy suggests they may have retained influence even after his time.  \n\nThe relationship between Leto II and the Fish Speakers was one of absolute devotion—they were his unwavering enforcers, embodying his will through service, ritual, and military discipline.
