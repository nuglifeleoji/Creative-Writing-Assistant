\n　　到街上的时候，少平对她说：“你先回去，我一个人慢慢后边走……” \n　　昏暗的路灯下，红梅无限感激地看着他，嘴唇颤动着，一句话也说不出来。 \n　　她这样久久地站了一阵，然后就低着头，抹着眼泪，在前面先走了。 \n　　少平一直目送着红梅的身影消失在远处的黑暗中，然后才长长地叹了一口气，一个人慢慢向学校走去。严厉的寒风象碎针扎在脸上一般刺疼，但他心里感到很烫贴。好了，一切都平息了。红梅又能正常地生活在人们之间，生活在阳光之下。把黑夜留给鬼魅吧，白天应该是属于人的……第二天，城里的学生们已经纷纷离校了。乡里的学生将在母校住宿最后的一天，明天一大早就要各自东西，各回各家。 \n　　学校大门口，同学们依依不舍地在相互送别。有的女同学都哭了。 \n　　是的，两年共同的生活，相互之间也许发生过口角、误会，甚至龋龊；但是，一旦到了分别的时刻，一切过去的不愉快就都烟消云散了，只留下美好而温暖的回忆和难分难舍的感情。在人的一生中，最美好的时光也许正是在自己的中学时代。那时我们多么年轻、纯洁、真挚、内心充满了生活的诗情…… \n　　少平和大家一样，不时簇拥着一位离校的同学，走出了学校的大门口——他们的结束与开始之门！他和乡里的同学们一块相约，什么时候到各自的村子里看望对方……下午快吃饭时，侯玉英肩膀上挎个黄书包，又一瘸一跛来找他。她怪不好意思地给少平送来一个非常精致的大笔记本，外面还用两条红丝线束着。她说：“咱们就要分别了，这点礼品送给你。你要是进城来，希望一定到我们家串串门……” \n　　侯玉英说完，就很快转过身走了。走了几步以后，又很不自然地回过头向他笑了笑。 \n　　孙少平这才想起，他还一直没接到侯玉英回赠的毕业礼物；原来她在最后的一刻，才把这么一个漂亮笔记本送给他——这个心眼很稠的人，送东西都是三等两样。少平见她前几天送给别人的笔记本根本不如这个好。 \n　　现在，侯玉英已经走出了校门口。孙少平奇怪：这笔记本上怎还缠着两条红丝线？ \n　　他好奇地把这两条丝线解开，翻开笔记本的破皮，突然从里面掉出一张折起来的纸片。 \n　　他打开纸片，原来是一封信——亲爱的少平： \n　　自从你昌（冒）着生命危险，奋不过（顾）身地抢救了我的生命后\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
