These tanks are intricately linked to both organic and mechanical components, utilizing female flesh as a biological substrate within metal containers to facilitate the growth and regeneration of gholas. The Tleilaxu employ this technology to resurrect the dead, manipulating cellular material to produce exact or modified replicas of the original beings. The process underscores the Tleilaxu's mastery of genetic engineering and their controversial methods, which often involve ethically ambiguous practices. Together, these descriptions highlight the Axolotl Tanks as a fusion of biological and technological systems, central to the Tleilaxu's ghola production.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754986075, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 124}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
