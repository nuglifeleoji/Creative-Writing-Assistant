操染病，服药无愈。适太史丞许芝，自许昌来见操。操令芝卜易。芝曰：“大王曾闻神卜管辂否？”操曰：“颇闻其名，未知其术。汝可详言之。”芝曰：“管辂字公明，平原人也。容貌粗丑，好酒疏狂。其父曾为琅琊即丘长。辂自幼便喜仰视星辰，夜不肯寐，父母不能禁止。常云家鸡野鹄，尚自知时，何况为人在世乎？与邻儿共戏，辄画地为天文，分布日月星辰。及稍长，即深明《周易》，仰观风角，数学通神，兼善相术。琅琊太守单子春闻其名，召辂相见。时有坐客百余人，皆能言之士。辂谓子春曰：辂年少胆气未坚，先请美酒三升，饮而后言。子春奇之，遂与酒三升。饮毕，辂问子春：今欲与辂为对者，若府君四座之士耶？子春曰：吾自与卿旗鼓相当。于是与辂讲论易理。辂亹亹而谈，言言精奥。子春反覆辩难，辂对答如流。从晓至暮，酒食不行。子春及众宾客，无不叹服。于是天下号为神童。后有居民郭恩者，兄弟三人，皆得躄疾，请辂卜之。辂曰：卦中有君家本墓中女鬼，非君伯母即叔母也。昔饥荒之年，谋数升米之利，推之落井，以大石压破其头，孤魂痛苦，自诉于天，故君兄弟有此报。不可禳也。郭恩等涕泣伏罪。安平太守王基，知辂神卜，延辂至家。适信都令妻常患头风，其子又患心痛，因请辂卜之。辂曰：此堂之西角有二死尸：一男持矛，一男持弓箭。头在壁内，脚在壁外。持矛者主刺头，故头痛；持弓箭者主刺胸腹，故心痛。乃掘之。入地八尺，果有二棺。一棺中有矛，一棺中有角弓及箭，木俱已朽烂。辂令徙骸骨去城外十里埋之，妻与子遂无恙。馆陶令诸葛原，迁新兴太守，辂往送行。客言辂能覆射。诸葛原不信，暗取燕卵、蜂窠、蜘蛛三物，分置三盒之中，令辂卜之。卦成，各写四句于盒上。其一曰：含气须变，依乎宇堂；雌雄以形，羽翼舒张：此燕卵也。其二曰：家室倒悬，门户众多；藏精育毒，得秋乃化：此蜂窠也。其三曰：觳觫长足，吐丝成罗；寻网求食，利在昏夜：此蜘蛛也。满座惊骇。乡中有老妇失牛，求卜之。辂判曰：北溪之滨，七人宰烹；急往追寻，皮肉尚存。\n######################\nOutput:",
