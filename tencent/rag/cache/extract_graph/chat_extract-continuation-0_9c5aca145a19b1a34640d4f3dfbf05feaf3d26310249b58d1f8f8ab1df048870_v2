Idaho felt that he had never before seen such rapture in human faces—not in the ecstasy of sex, not in glorious victory-at-arms—nowhere had he seen anything to approach this intense adulation.\n“Duncan Idaho stands beside me today,” Leto said. “Duncan is here to declare his loyalty that all may hear it. Duncan?”\nIdaho felt a physical chill shoot through his intestines. Leto gave him a simple choice: Declare your loyalty to the God Emperor or die!\nlf | sneer, vacillate or object in any way, the women will kill me with their own hands.\nA deep anger suffused Idaho. He swallowed, cleared his throat, then: “Let no one question my loyalty. | am loyal to the Atreides.”\nHe heard his own voice booming out over the room, amplified by Leto’s Ixian device.\nThe effect startled Idaho.\n“We share!” the women screamed. “We share! We share!”\n“We share,” Leto said.\nYoung Fish Speaker trainees, identifiable by their short green robes, swarmed into the hall from all sides, little knots of movement which eddied throughout the pattern of the adoring faces. Each trainee carried a tray piled high with tiny brown wafers. As the trays moved through the throng, hands reached out in waves of graceful grasping, an undulant dancing of the arms. Each hand took a wafer and held it aloft. When a tray bearer came to the ledge and lifted her burden toward Idaho, Leto said:\n“Take two and pass one into my hand.”\nIdaho knelt and took two wafers. The things felt crisp and fragile. He stood and passed one gently to Leto.\nIn a stentorian voice, Leto asked: “Has the new Guard been chosen?”\n“Yes, Lord!” the women shouted.\n“Do you keep my faith?”\n“Yes, Lord!”\n“Do you walk the Golden Path?”\n“Yes, Lord!”\nThe vibration of the women’s shouts sent shock waves through Idaho, stunning him.\n“Do we Share?” Leto asked.\n“Yes, Lord!”\nAs the women responded, Leto popped his wafer into his mouth. Each mother below the ledge took a bite from her wafer and offered the rest to her child. The massed Fish Speakers behind the whiteclad women lowered their arms and ate their wafers.\n“Duncan, eat your wafer,” Leto said.\nIdaho slipped the thing into his mouth. His ghola body had not been conditioned to the spice but memory spoke to his senses. The wafer tasted faintly bitter with a soft undertone of melange. The taste swept old memories through Idaho’s awareness—meals in sietch, banquets at the Atreides Residency .. . the way spice flavors permeated everything in the old days.\nAs he swallowed the wafer, Idaho grew conscious of the stillness in the hall, a breath-held quiet into which came a loud click from Leto’s cart. Idaho turned and sought the source of the sound. Leto had opened a compartment in the bed of his cart and was removing a crystal box from it. The box glowed with a blue-gray inner light. Leto placed the box on the bed of his cart, opened the glowing lid and removed a crysknife. Idaho recognized the blade immediately—the hawk engraved on the handle’s butt, the green jewels at the hilt.\nThe crysknife of Paul Muad’Dib!\nIdaho found himself deeply moved at the sight of this blade. He stared at it as though the image in his eyes might reproduce the original owner.\nLeto lifted the blade and held it high, revealing the elegant curve and milky iridescence.\n“The talisman of our lives,” Leto said.\nThe women remained silent, raptly attentive.\n“The knife of Muad’Dib,” Leto said. “The tooth of Shai- Hulud. Will Shai-Hulud come again?”\nThe response was a subdued murmur made deeply powerful by contrast with the previous shouting.\n“Yes, Lord.”\nIdaho returned his attention to the enraptured faces of the Fish Speakers.\n“Who is Shai-Hulud?” Leto asked.\nAgain, that deep murmur: “You, Lord.”\nIdaho nodded to himself. Here was undeniable evidence that Leto had tapped into a monstrous reservoir of power never before unleashed in quite this way. Leto had said it but the words were a meaningless noise compared to the thing seen and felt in this great hall. Leto’s words came back to Idaho, though, as if they had waited for this moment to cloak themselves in their true meaning. Idaho recalled that they had been in the crypt, that dank and shadowy place which Leto seemed to find so attractive but which Idaho found so repellent—the dust of centuries there and the odors of ancient decay.\n“I have been forming this human society, shaping it for more than three thousand years, opening a door out of adolescence for the entire species,” Leto had said.\n“Nothing you say explains a female army!” Idaho had protested.\n“Rape is foreign to women, Duncan. You ask for a sex- rooted behavioral difference? There’s one.”\n“Stop changing the subject!”\n“I do not change it. Rape was always the pay-off in male military conquest. Males did not have to abandon any of their adolescent fantasies while engaging in rape.”\nIdaho recalled the glowering anger which had come over him at this thrust.\n“My houris tame the males,” Leto said. “It is domestication, a thing that females know from eons of necessity.”\nIdaho stared wordlessly at Leto’s cowled face.\n“To tame,” Leto said. “To fit into some orderly survival pattern. Women learned it at the hands of men; now men learn it at the hands of women.”\n“But you said...”\n“My houris often submit to a form of rape at first only to convert this into a deep and binding mutual dependence.”\n“Dammit! You're...”\n“Binding, Duncan! Binding.”\n“| don’t feel bound to...”\n“Education takes time. You are the ancient norm against which the new can be measured.”\nLeto’s words momentarily flushed Idaho of all emotion except a deep sense of loss.\n“My houris teach maturation,” Leto said. “They know that they must supervise the maturation of males. Through this they find their own maturation. Eventually, houris merge into wives and mothers and we wean the violent drives away from their adolescent fixations.”\n“I'll have to see it to believe it!”\n“You will see it at the Great Sharing.”\nAs he stood beside Leto in the hall of Siaynog, Idaho admitted to himself that he had seen something of enormous power, something which might create the kind of human universe Leto’s words projected.\nLeto was restoring the crysknife to its box, returning the box to its compartment in the bed of the Royal Cart. The women watched in silence, even the small children quiet—\neveryone subdued by the force which could be felt in this great hall.\nIdaho looked down at the children, knowing from Leto’s explanation that these children would be rewarded with positions of power—male or female, each in a puissant niche. The male children would be female-dominated throughout their lives, making (in Leto’s words) “an easy transition from adolescence into breeding males.”\nFish Speakers and their progeny lived lives “possessed of a certain excitement not available to most others.”\nWhat will happen to Irti’s children? idaho wondered. Did my predecessor stand here and watch his whiteclad wife share in Leto’s ritual?\nWhat does Leto offer me here?\nWith that female army, an ambitious commander could take over Leto’s Empire. Or could he? No... not while Leto lived. Leto said the women were not militarily aggressive “by nature.”\nHe said: “I do not foster that in them. They know a cyclical pattern with a Royal Festival every ten years, a changing of the Guard, a blessing for the new generation, a silent thought for fallen sisters and loved ones gone forever. Siaynog after Siaynog marches onward in predictable measure. The change itself becomes non-change.”\nIdaho lifted his gaze from the women in white and their children. He looked across the mass of silent faces, telling himself that this was only a small core of that enormous female force which spread its feminine web across the Empire. He could believe Leto’s words:\n“The power does not weaken. It grows stronger every decade.”\nTo what end? Idaho asked himself.\nHe glanced at Leto who was lifting his hands in benediction over the hall of his houris.\n“We will move among you now,” Leto said.\nThe women below the ledge opened a path, pressing backward. The path opened deeper into the throng like a fissure spreading through the earth after some tremendous natural upheaval.\n“Duncan, you will precede me,” Leto said.\nIdaho swallowed in a dry throat. He put a palm on the lip of the ledge and dropped down into the open space, moving out into the fissure because he knew only that could end this trial.\nA quick glance backward showed him Leto’s cart drifting majestically down on its Suspensors.\nIdaho turned and quickened his pace.\nThe women narrowed the path through their ranks. It was done in an odd stillness, with fixity of attention—first on Idaho and then on that gross pre-worm body riding behind Idaho on the Ixian cart.\nAs Idaho marched stoically ahead, women reached from all sides to touch him, to touch Leto, or merely to touch the Royal Cart. Idaho felt the restrained passion in their touch and knew the deepest fear in his experience.\nThe problem of leadership is inevitably: Who will play God? —MUAD’DIB, FROM THE ORAL HISTORY\nwi Noree followed a young Fish Speaker guide down a\nwide ramp which spiraled into the depths of Onn. The summons from the Lord Leto had come in late evening of the Festival’s third day, interrupting a development which had taxed her ability to maintain emotional balance.\nHer first assistant, Othwi Yake, was not a pleasant man—a sandy-haired creature with a long, narrow face and eyes which never looked long at anything and never ever looked directly into the eyes of someone he addressed. Yake had presented her with a single sheet of memerase paper containing what he described as “a summation of recently reported violence in the Festival City.”\nStanding close to the desk at which she was seated, he had stared down somewhere to her left and said: “Fish Speakers are slaughtering Face Dancers throughout the City.” He did not appear particularly moved by this.\n“Why?” she demanded.\n“It is said that the Bene Tleilax made an attempt on the God Emperor's life.”\nA thrill of fear shot through her. She sat back and glanced around the ambassadorial office—a round room with a single half-circle desk which concealed the controls for many Ixian devices beneath its highly polished surface. The room was a darkly important-appearing place with brown wood panels covering instruments which shielded it from spying. There were no windows.\nTrying not to show her upset, Hwi looked up at Yake. “And the Lord Leto is...”\n“The attempt on his life appears to have been totally without effect. But it might explain that flogging.”\n“Then you think there was such an attempt?”\n“Yes.”\nThe Fish Speaker from the Lord Leto entered at that moment, hard on the announcement of her presence in the outer office. She was followed by a Bene Gesserit crone, a person she introduced as “The Reverend Mother Anteac.” Anteac stared intently at Yake while the Fish Speaker, a young woman with smooth, almost childlike features, delivered her message:\n“He told me to remind you: ‘\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a powerful and enigmatic ruler who has shaped human society for over three thousand years. He commands absolute loyalty and adoration from his followers, particularly the Fish Speakers, and wields immense political and religious power. His physical form is grotesque, resembling a pre-worm, and he uses advanced technology like the Ixian device and the Royal Cart. Leto's philosophy revolves around the Golden Path, a long-term plan for humanity's survival and maturation, which involves taming violent male tendencies through female-dominated structures like the Fish Speakers. He is deeply connected to the spice melange and the cultural legacy of Paul Muad'Dib, as evidenced by his possession of Paul's crysknife. Leto's rule is characterized by ritualistic ceremonies like the Great Sharing, where he reinforces his divine status and the communal bonds of his followers.

Idaho's ghola body lacks spice conditioning, but he retains vivid memories of his past lives, including his time with the Atreides. He is deeply moved by the sight of Paul Muad'Dib's crysknife, indicating his emotional ties to the Atreides legacy. Idaho is forced to publicly declare his loyalty to Leto during the Great Sharing ceremony, where he participates in the ritual consumption of spice-laced wafers.

The Fish Speakers oversee rituals like the Great Sharing, where they distribute spice wafers to the populace, symbolizing communal unity under Leto's rule. They are not militarily aggressive but maintain a cyclical, ritualistic structure with events like the Royal Festival every decade.

The event underscores Leto's connection to the spice melange and the cultural legacy of the Atreides.
