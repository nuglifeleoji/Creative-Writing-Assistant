She is depicted as a supportive partner to her husband, 希恩斯 (Heins), reflecting a profound understanding of his struggles and emotional state. Their relationship is characterized by a blend of personal and professional interactions, as she assists him at the Faith Center and engages in discussions about advanced computing technology, including the capabilities of a supercomputer.\n\nAs a member of the Earth Trisolaris organization, 山杉惠子 holds a special status that allows her to participate in significant meetings, despite not being a wall-facer. Her involvement extends to the realm of psychological research, where she holds a degree in psychology and collaborates with 希恩斯 on various projects, including the study of brain imaging and the implications of thought control technologies. She is portrayed as a dedicated researcher, contributing to the understanding of memory disorders and mental health, which has earned her and 希恩斯 a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work in treating amnesia and psychiatric conditions.\n\n山杉惠子 is also depicted in a domestic setting, where she reflects on her relationship with 希恩斯 and observes the interactions of young military officers, showcasing her ability to empathize with others. Her stoic demeanor during meetings contrasts with her emotional depth, as she grapples with the complexities of her life and the pressures surrounding her.\n\nTragically, 山杉惠子’s story culminates in a poignant moment when she takes her own life in the quiet room of the United Nations conference hall, cursing 希恩斯 before her death. This act underscores the intense emotional turmoil she experienced, despite her outward support for him and their shared ambitions. Throughout her narrative, she is portrayed as a figure of strength and vulnerability, navigating the challenges of her personal and professional life while grappling with the weight of her decisions and the impact of her environment.\n\nIn summary, 山杉惠子 is a character marked by her intelligence, emotional complexity, and dedication to both her husband and her research.
