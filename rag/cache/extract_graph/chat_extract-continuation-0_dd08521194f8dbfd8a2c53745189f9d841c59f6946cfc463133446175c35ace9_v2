They both knew what she wanted.\n“Excellent!” she agreed and went into the required performance. “But it must be treated gently, Placido, the oysters not overcooked. Some of our own powdered dry celery in the broth.”\n“And perhaps a bit of paprika?”\n“I always prefer it that way. Be extremely careful with the melange. A breath of it and no more.”\n“Of course, Mother Superior!” Eyes rolling in horror at the thought he might use too much melange. “So easy for the\nspice to dominate.”\n“Cook the oysters in clam nectar, Placido. | would prefer you watch over them yourself, stirring gently until the edges of the oysters just start to curl.”\n“Not a second longer, Mother Superior.”\n“Heat some quite creamy milk on the side. Don’t boil it!”\nPlacido displayed astonishment that she might suspect him of boiling the milk for her oyster stew.\n“A small pat of butter in the serving bowl,” Odrade said. “Pour the combined broth over it.”\n“No sherry?”\n“How glad | am that you are taking personal charge of my special dish, Placido. | forgot the sherry.” (Mother Superior never forgot anything and they all knew it but this was a required step in the dance.)\n“Three ounces of sherry in the cooking broth,” he said.\n“Heat it to get rid of the alcohol.”\n“Of course! But we must not bruise the flavors. Would you like croutons or saltines?”\n“Croutons, please.”\nSeated at an alcove table, Odrade ate two bowls of oyster stew, remembering how Sea Child had savored it. Papa had introduced her to this dish when she was barely capable of conveying spoon to mouth. He had made the stew himself, his own specialty. Odrade had taught it to Salat.\nShe complimented Salat on the wine.\n“| particularly enjoyed your choice of a chablis for accompaniment.”\n“A flinty chablis with a sharp edge on it, Mother Superior. One of our better vintages. It sets off the oyster flavors admirably.”\nTamalane found her in the alcove. They always knew where to find Mother Superior when they wanted her.\n“We are ready.” Was that displeasure on Tam’s face?\n“Where will we stop tonight?”\n“Eldio.”\nOdrade smiled. She liked Eldio.\nTam catering to me because I’m in a critical mood? Perhaps we have the makings of a small diversion.\nFollowing Tamalane to the transport docks, Odrade thought how characteristic it was that the older woman preferred to travel by tube. Surface trips annoyed her. “Who wants to waste time at my age?”\nOdrade disliked tubes for personal transport. You were so closed in and helpless! She preferred surface or air and used tubes only when speed was urgent. She had no hesitation about using smaller tubes for chits and notes. Notes don’t care just as long as they get there.\nThis thought always made her conscious of the network that adjusted to her movements wherever she went.\nSomewhere in the heart of things (there was always a “heart of things”) an automated system routed communications and made sure (most of the time) that important missives arrived where addressed.\nWhen Private Dispatch (they all called it PD) was not needed, stat or viz was available along scrambled sorters and lightlines. Off-planet was another matter, especially in these hunted times. Safest to send a Reverend Mother with memorized message or distrans implant. Every messenger took heavier doses of shere these days. T-probes could read even a dead mind not guarded by shere. Every off-planet message was encrypted but an enemy might hit on the one- time cover concealing it. Great risk off-planet. Perhaps that was why the Rabbi remained silent.\nNow why am I thinking such things at this moment?\n“No word yet from Dortujla?” she asked as Tamalane prepared to enter the Dispatch roundelay where the others in their party waited. So many people. Why so many?\nOdrade saw Streggi up ahead at the edge of the dock talking to a Communications acolyte. There were at least six other people from Communications nearby.\nTamalane turned in obvious pique. “Dortujla! We have all said we will notify you the instant we hear!”\n“I was just asking, Tam. Just asking.”\nMeekly, Odrade followed Tamalane into Dispatch. / should put a monitor on my mind and question everything that rises there. Mental intrusions always had good reason behind them. That was the Bene Gesserit way, as Bellonda often reminded her.\nOdrade felt surprise at herself then, realizing she was more than a little sick of Bene Gesserit ways.\nLet Bell worry about such things for a change!\nThis was a time for floating free, for responding like a will o’ the wisp to the currents moving around her.\nSea Child knew about currents.\nTime does not count itself. You have only to look at a circle and this is apparent.\n—LETO II (THE TYRANT)\nfd Fas Look what we have come to!” the Rabbi wailed.\nHe sat cross-legged on the cold curved floor with his Shawl pulled up over his head and almost concealing his face.\nThe room around him was gloomy and resonating with Small machinery sounds that made him feel weak. If those sounds should stop!\nRebecca stood in front of him, hands on her hips, a look of weary frustration on her face.\n“Do not stand there like that!” the Rabbi commanded. He peered up at her from beneath the shawl.\n“If you despair, then are we not lost?” she asked.\nThe sound of her voice angered him and he was a moment putting this unwanted emotion aside.\nShe dares to instruct me? But was it not said by wiser men that knowledge can come from a weed? A great shuddering sigh shook him and he dropped the shawl to his shoulders. Rebecca helped him stand.\n“A no-chamber,” the Rabbi muttered. “In here, we hide from...” His gaze searched upward at a dark ceiling. “Better left unspoken even here.”\n“We hide from the unspeakable,” Rebecca said.\n“The door cannot even be left open at Passover,” he said. “How will the Stranger enter?”\n“Some strangers we do not want,” she said.\n“Rebecca.” He bowed his head. “You are more than a trial and a problem. This little cell of Secret Israel shares your exile because we understand that—”\n“Stop saying that! You understand nothing of what has happened to me. My problem?” She leaned close to him. “It is to remain human while in contact with all of those past lives.”\nThe Rabbi recoiled.\n“So you are no longer one of us? Are you a Bene Gesserit then?”\n“You will know when I’m Bene Gesserit. You will see me looking at myself as | look at myself.”\nHis brows drew down in a scowl. “What are you saying?”\n“What does a mirror look at, Rabbi?”\n“Hmmmmph! Riddles now.” But a faint smile twitched at his mouth. A look of determination returned to his eyes. He stared around him at the room. There were eight of them here—more than this space should hold. A no-chamber! It had been assembled painstakingly with smuggled bits and pieces. So small. Twelve and a half meters long. He had measured it himself. A shape like an ancient barrel laid on its side, oval in cross section and with half-globe closures at the ends. The ceiling was no more than a meter above his head. The widest point here at the center was only five meters and the curve of floor and ceiling made it seem even narrower. Dried food and recycled water. That was what they must live on and for how long? One SY maybe if they were not found. He did not trust the security of this device. Those peculiar sounds in the machinery.\nIt had been late in the day when they crept into this hole. Darkness up there now for sure. And where were the rest of his people? Fled to whatever sanctuary they could find, drawing on old debts and honorable commitments for past services. Some would survive. Perhaps they would survive better than this remnant in here.\nThe entrance to the no-chamber lay concealed beneath an ash pit with a free-standing chimney beside it. The reinforcing metal of the chimney contained threads of ridulian crystal to relay exterior scenes into this place. Ashes! The room still smelled of burned things and it already had begun to take on a sewer stink from the small recycling chamber. What a euphemism for a toilet!\nSomeone came up behind the Rabbi. “The searchers are leaving. Lucky we were warned in time.”\nIt was Joshua, the one who had built this chamber. He was a short, slender man with a sharply triangular face narrowing to a thin chin. Dark hair swept over his broad forehead. He had widely spaced brown eyes that looked out at his world with a brooding inwardness the Rabbi did not trust. He looks too young to know so much about these things.\n“So they are leaving,” the Rabbi said. “They will be back. You will not think us lucky then.”\n“They will not guess we hid so near the farm,” Rebecca said. “The searchers were mostly looting.”\n“Listen to the Bene Gesserit,” the Rabbi said.\n“Rabbi.” What a chiding sound in Joshua’s voice! “Have | not heard you say many times that the blessed ones are they who hide the flaws of others even from themselves?”\n“Everybody’s a teacher now!” the Rabbi said. “But who can tell us what will happen next?”\nHe had to admit the truth of Joshua’s words, though. /t is the anguish of our flight that troubles me. Our little diaspora. But we do not scatter from Babylon. We hide in a...acyclone cellar!\nThis thought restored him. Cyclones pass.\n“Who is in charge of the food?” he asked. “We must ration ourselves from the start.”\nRebecca heaved a sigh of relief. The Rabbi was at his worst in the wide oscillations—too emotional or too intellectual. He had himself in hand once more. He would\nbecome intellectual next. That would have to be dampened, too. Bene Gesserit awareness gave her a new view of the people around her. Our Jewish susceptibility. Look at the intellectuals!\nIt was a thought peculiar to the Sisterhood. The drawbacks of anyone placing considerable reliance on intellectual achievements were large. She could not deny all of that evidence from the Lampadas horde. Speaker paraded it for her whenever she wavered.\nRebecca had come almost to enjoy the pursuit of memory fancies, as she thought of them. Knowing earlier times forced her to deny her own earlier times. She had been required to believe so many things she now knew were nonsense. Myths and chimera, impulses of extremely childish behavior.\n“Our gods should mature as we mature.”\nRebecca suppressed a smile. Speaker did that to her often —a little nudge in the ribs from someone who knew you would appreciate it.\nJoshua had gone back to his instruments. She saw that someone was reviewing the catalogue of food stores. The Rabbi watched this with his normal intensity. Others had rolled themselves into blankets and were sleeping on the cots in the darkened end of the chamber. Seeing all of this, Rebecca knew what her function must be. Keep us from boredom.\n“The games master?”\nUnless you have something better to suggest, don’t try to tell me about my own people, Speaker.\nWhatever else she might say about these inner conversations, there was no doubt that all of the pieces were connected—the past with this room, this room with her projections\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, known for her strategic thinking and leadership)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLACIDO<|>PERSON<|>Placido is a cook who prepares meals for Odrade, demonstrating careful attention to her preferences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Tamalane is a senior member of the Bene Gesserit who assists Odrade in her duties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit who often reminds Odrade of their ways and traditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREGGI<|>PERSON<|>Streggi is an acolyte seen talking to a Communications acolyte at the transport docks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORTUJLA<|>PERSON<|>Dortujla is a person whose status or message Odrade is concerned about)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBI<|>PERSON<|>The Rabbi is a leader of a hidden Jewish group, struggling with the challenges of their situation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REBECCA<|>PERSON<|>Rebecca is a member of the hidden Jewish group with Bene Gesserit awareness, providing guidance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSHUA<|>PERSON<|>Joshua is the builder of the no-chamber, a key figure in the group's survival)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive organization with deep influence and strict traditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECRET ISRAEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Secret Israel is a hidden group of Jews trying to survive in hostile conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELDIO<|>GEO<|>Eldio is a location where Odrade and her party will stop during their travels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location where Samuel Namara was held, mentioned in a previous context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NO-CHAMBER<|>EVENT<|>The no-chamber is a hidden refuge built to evade detection, a critical event for the group's survival)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>PLACIDO<|>Odrade gives detailed cooking instructions to Placido, showing trust in his skills<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TAMALANE<|>Odrade and Tamalane work closely together, with Tamalane assisting in logistics<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BELLONDA<|>Odrade and Bellonda have a relationship marked by mutual respect and occasional frustration<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>DORTUJLA<|>Odrade is concerned about Dortujla's status, indicating a significant relationship<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABBI<|>REBECCA<|>The Rabbi and Rebecca have a complex relationship, with Rebecca providing guidance and support<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABBI<|>JOSHUA<|>The Rabbi relies on Joshua for the no-chamber's construction and maintenance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REBECCA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Rebecca has Bene Gesserit awareness, influencing her actions and thoughts<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECRET ISRAEL<|>NO-CHAMBER<|>Secret Israel uses the no-chamber to hide from threats, a critical survival strategy<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>ELDIO<|>Odrade likes Eldio, indicating a personal preference for the location<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
