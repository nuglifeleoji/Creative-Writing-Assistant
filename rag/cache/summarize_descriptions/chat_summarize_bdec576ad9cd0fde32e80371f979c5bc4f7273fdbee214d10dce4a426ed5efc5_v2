This exchange is typically conducted among Sisters, often under life-threatening conditions or in preparation for death, ensuring the preservation of vital wisdom. The ritual has been performed in various contexts, such as when **Murbella** engaged in Sharing with **Odrade's corpse**, or when **Lucilla** and **Rebecca** participated in the process. Similarly, **Odrade**, **Murbella**, and **Sheeana** were involved in Sharing to exchange critical insights.  \n\nWhile primarily a Bene Gesserit practice, the concept of Sharing extends beyond the Sisterhood, as seen in discussions between **Waff** and **Taraza**, where it refers more broadly to the exchange of knowledge or experiences. However, the core function remains rooted in the Bene Gesserit tradition—a ceremonial transfer of memories that strengthens the order’s collective intelligence and ensures continuity.  \n\nThe ritual is not limited to living participants; it can also involve the deceased, as demonstrated by Odrade’s posthumous memory transfer. Whether performed as a pre-death rite or an active exchange between living Sisters, Sharing serves as a crucial mechanism for preserving the Bene Gesserit’s accumulated wisdom and reinforcing their intricate web of influence. The descriptions consistently emphasize its role in memory transmission, though the specifics of participants and circumstances may vary.  \n\nIn summary, **SHARING** is a deeply ingrained Bene Gesserit practice that facilitates the transfer of memories and experiences, often under urgent or solemn conditions, ensuring the perpetuation of their knowledge across generations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251858, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 345, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 702, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 293}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
