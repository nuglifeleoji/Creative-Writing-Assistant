\n　　少平把铺盖卷仍然搁在砖墙边上，用两只烂手卷起一支旱烟棒，圪蹴在墙边抽起来。他现在看起来完全成了个老练的出门人。再也没有了初来乍到时的那种紧张和慌乱。当然，更踏实的是，他身上装着赚来的六十元工钱，十天八天不必为生计而担心。再说，天气也暖和起来，不用再为住宿发愁。夏天啊，这是揽工汉的黄金季节！ \n　　他这样平静地一直坐到满城灯火辉煌。这时候，他心里猛一下想起了他的朋友金波，他现在很想去见见他——自从金波到黄原后，他们还一直没有见过面。 \n　　是呀，他们再不是小孩子，已经各自开始到社会上谋生；尽管内心仍然象过去一样情深义重，但顾不得在一块相处了。 \n　　少平知道，金波就在东关邮政局跟他父亲学开车——金俊海已经从地区运输公司调出来开了邮车。两月前初到黄原时，他不愿意去找金波，以免让朋友看见他一副流落样子而难为情。那时他仍然没有克服掉中学生那种自尊自爱的心理。两个月来，石头和钢铁已经把那层羞涩的面纱撕得粉碎！但少平为了不使他这身破烂行装“惊吓”了他的朋友，还是决定在见金波之前，先收拾和“化装”一番。 \n　　他想了一下，便即刻带上行李，从大桥头走到长途汽车站的候车室。 \n　　他接着又进了候车室的男厕所。 \n　　孙小平在厕所里把他那身新买的的卡衣服换在身上，而把原来身上的烂衣服又塞进破提包。 \n　　他从厕所出来，花了二毛钱，把自己那卷破被褥连同烂提包，一起在车站的寄存处寄存了——可以存放到明天早晨八点钟。 \n　　现在，他象换了一个人似的，一身轻快地出了候车室。他借着一家商店被路灯光照亮的玻璃窗，用五个手指头把自己乱蓬蓬的头发匆匆梳理了一下。他满意地冲着玻璃中那个模糊的他笑了笑：看这身打份，你象一个在黄原城里混得蛮不错的家伙哩！ \n　　于是，他撩开两条修长壮实的腿，迫不及待地向东关邮政局那里走去。 \n                  第17章\n　　少平的突然出现，显然使金波大吃一惊。 \n　　金波仍然没变模样，细皮嫩肉，浓眉大眼，穿一身干净的黄军装，一看就是个退伍军人。他好象刚洗过澡，头发梳得整整齐齐，脸上泛出光滑的红润。 \n　　他兴奋地问少平：“刚从家里来？” \n　　“我到黄原已经两个月了！” \n　　“啊？你在什么地方哩？”金波惊讶了。 \n　　“我在阳沟给人家做活……刚结工。” \n　　“那你为\n######################\nOutput:",
