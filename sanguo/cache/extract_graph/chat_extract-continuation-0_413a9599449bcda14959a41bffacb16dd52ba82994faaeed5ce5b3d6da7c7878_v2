�。中平六年夏四月，灵帝病笃，召大将军何进入宫，商议后事。那何进起身屠家；因妹入宫为贵人，生皇子辩，遂立为皇后。进由是得权重任。帝又宠幸王美人，生皇子协。何后嫉妒，鸩杀王美人。皇子协养于董太后宫中。董太后乃灵帝之母，解渎亭侯刘苌之妻也。初因桓帝无子，迎立解渎亭侯之子，是为灵帝。灵帝入继大统，遂迎养母氏于宫中，尊为太后。董太后尝劝帝立皇子协为太子。帝亦偏爱协，欲立之。当时病笃，中常侍蹇硕奏曰：“若欲立协，必先诛何进，以绝后患。”帝然其说，因宣进入宫。进至宫门，司马潘隐谓进曰：“不可入宫。蹇硕欲谋杀公。”进大惊，急归私宅，召诸大臣，欲尽诛宦官。座上一人挺身出曰：“宦官之势，起自冲、质之时；朝廷滋蔓极广，安能尽诛？倘机不密，必有灭族之祸：请细详之。”进视之，乃典军校尉曹操也。进叱曰：“汝小辈安知朝廷大事！”正踌躇间，潘隐至，言：“帝已崩。今赛硕与十常侍商议，秘不发丧，矫诏宣何国舅入宫，欲绝后患，册立皇子协为帝。”说未了，使命至，宣进速入，以定后事。操曰：“今日之计，先宜正君位，然后图贼。”进曰：“谁敢与吾正君讨贼？”一人挺身出曰：“愿借精兵五千，斩关入内，册立新君，尽诛阉竖，扫清朝廷，以安天下！”进视之，乃司徒袁逢之子，袁隗之侄：名绍，字本初，现为司隶校尉。何进大喜，遂点御林军五千。绍全身披挂。何进引何顒、荀攸、郑泰等大臣三十余员，相继而入，就灵帝柩前，扶立太子辩即皇帝位。\n\n

百官呼拜已毕，袁绍入宫收蹇硕。硕慌走入御园，花阴下为中常侍郭胜所杀。硕所领禁军，尽皆投顺。绍谓何进曰：“中官结党。今日可乘势尽诛之。”张让等知事急，慌入告何后曰：“始初设谋陷害大将军者，止赛硕一人，并不干臣等事。今大将军听袁绍之言，欲尽诛臣等，乞娘娘怜悯！”何太后曰：“汝等勿忧，我当保汝。”传旨宣何进入。太后密谓曰：“我与汝出身寒微，非张让等，焉能享此富贵？今蹇硕不仁，既已伏诛，汝何听信人言，欲尽诛宦官耶？”何进听罢，出谓众官曰：“蹇硕设谋害我，可族灭其家。其余不必妄加残害。”袁绍曰：“若不斩草除根，必为�\n######################\nOutput:",
