一彪军到，门旗开处，只见一队军马，打龙凤日月旗幡，四斗五方旌帜，金瓜银斧，黄钺白旄，黄罗销金伞盖之下，袁术身披金甲，腕悬两刀，立于阵前，大骂：“吕布，背主家奴！”布怒，挺戟向前。术将李丰挺枪来迎；战不三合，被布刺伤其手，丰弃枪而走。吕布麾兵冲杀，术军大乱。吕布引军从后追赶，抢夺马匹衣甲无数。袁术引着败军，走不上数里，山背后一彪军出，截住去路。当先一将乃关云长也，大叫：“反贼！”还不受死！”袁术慌走，余众四散奔逃，被云长大杀了一阵。袁术收拾败军，奔回淮南去了。吕布得胜，邀请云长并杨奉、韩暹等一行人马到徐州，大排筵宴管待，军士都有犒赏。次日，云长辞归。布保韩暹为沂都牧、杨奉为琅琊牧，商议欲留二人在徐州。陈珪曰：“不可。韩、杨二人据山东，不出一年，则山东城敦皆属将军也。”布然之，遂送二将暂于沂都、琅琊二处屯扎，以候恩命。陈登私问父曰：“何不留二人在徐州，为杀吕布之根？”珪曰：“倘二人协助吕布，是反为虎添爪牙也。”登乃服父之高见。\n\n    却说袁术败回淮南，遣人往江东问孙策借兵报仇。策怒曰：“汝赖吾玉玺，僭称帝号，背反汉室，大逆不道！吾方欲加兵问罪，岂肯反助叛贼乎！”遂作书以绝之。使者赍书回见袁术。术看毕，怒曰：“黄口孺子，何敢乃尔！吾先伐之！”长史杨大将力谏方止。却说孙策自发书后，防袁术兵来，点军守住江口。忽曹操使至，拜策为会稽太守，令起兵征讨袁术。策乃商议。便欲起兵。长史张昭曰：“术虽新败，兵多粮足，未可轻敌。不如遗书曹操，劝他南征，吾为后应：两军相援，术军必败。万一有失，亦望操救援。”策从其言，遣使以此意达曹操。\n\n    却说曹操至许都，思幕典韦，立祀祭之；封其子典满为中郎，收养在府。忽报孙策遣使致书，操览书毕；又有人报袁术乏粮，劫掠陈留。欲乘虚攻之，遂兴兵南征。令曹仁守许都，其余皆从征：马步兵十七万，粮食辎重千余车。一面先发人会合孙策与刘备、吕布。兵至豫州界上，玄德早引兵来迎，操命请入营。相见毕，玄德献上首级二颗。操惊曰：“此是何人首级？”玄德曰：“此韩暹、杨奉之首级也。”操�\n######################\nOutput:",
