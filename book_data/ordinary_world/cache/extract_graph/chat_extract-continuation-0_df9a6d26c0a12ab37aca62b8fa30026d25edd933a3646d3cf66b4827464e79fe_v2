\n　　在很大程度上，他正是被家庭接二连三的灾难彻底击倒在这块破碾盘上的。当润生突然提出要和一个有孩子的寡妇成亲时，他就对这打击招架不住了。在此之前，女儿和女婿的不幸婚姻已经使他痛苦不堪。紧接着，如同当空响了一声炸雷，他的女婿双腿被汽车砸断。女儿重新回到废物般的女婿身边并没有给他带来什么安慰——尽管盼望他们和好一直是他最大的心愿。润叶最终和一个残废在一块过日子，这还不如当初就和李向前一刀两断！他知道，对于他的女儿来说，真正的灾难才“正式”开始了……对田福堂来说，灾难绝不仅来自女儿女婿，最使他老两口痛心的，是他们视为掌上明珠的儿子，竟然鬼迷心窍，一心要和远路上那个该死的寡妇结亲。他们好说歪说，说是说不转这小子。结果，不知是真的神经出了问题，还是装疯卖傻，这润生整天哭哭笑笑，东转西游，几乎快成了死去的田二的接班人。更为可怕的是，儿子在前几天终于跑了——他给他妈留话说，他要去找那个寡妇，而且永远不再回这个家来…… \n　　命运啊，如此残酷无情！这叫他老两口怎样在这世界上活下去呢？ \n　　他如今躺在这里，尽管嘴里还出气，但确实象死人一般。他活过了今天，而不知道明天该怎么办……田福堂不是不知道孙少安今天要大耍一回排场。昨天，孙玉亭还拖拉着当年送给他的那双破鞋，来到这碾盘前，请他今天去“出席”哩。去你的蛋！老子现在这摊场，有什么心思去赶你们的红火热闹？ \n　　但玉亭溅着唾沫星子，不屈不挠地要他代表双水村党支部为他侄儿致”祝词”。他连眼皮也没往起抬，说：“我病成这个样子，怎去？你是不是眼睛瞎得看不见了？你叫金俊山去！” \n　　“你终归是咱村里的一把手！”玉亭继续打劝他。“一把手是个屁！我现在只剩一把干骨头了！”他厌恶地对他的前助手说。 \n　　“县上的周县长要亲自来出席哩！”孙玉亭又提醒他。“我没见过县长？我家里地委书记都有！你赶快拍县长的马屁去吧！看他能不能把你也提拔一下！”他恶毒地挖苦孙玉亭说。 \n　　孙玉亭不敢和他顶嘴，只好悻悻然走了。 \n　　田福堂知道，在这种时候，你把孙玉亭骂成个龟子孙，他也不在乎。他现在什么也不顾，只顾跑烂鞋地张这宗“喜事”。他会拖拉着烂鞋，一时三刻就趟过东拉河，兴奋地出现在金俊山的院子里……“狗改不了吃屎\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
