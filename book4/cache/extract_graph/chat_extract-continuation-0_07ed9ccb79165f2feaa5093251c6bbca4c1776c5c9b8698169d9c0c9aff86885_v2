长中间抽一个人担任副总指挥。因为会战在双水村，这差事当然就落在了孙玉亭的身上。立刻，他在工地上跑前跑后，动不动还在高音喇叭上发布各种通知和命令；他哥当年没把他造就成个人物，革命已经俨然使他成为一个人物了。连他老婆这一段也开始尊敬地称呼他“玉亭”，前面不再带那个“孙”字。而最使他满意的是，他现在还可以在民工大灶上吃饭，重温当年太原钢厂的享受——由于他是副总指挥，做饭的人都巴结他，碗里的肥肉明显比别人多。过个两三天，他还可以和治功和高虎钻在灶房后面的小土窑里，混着一块吃几盘炒菜，喝两口烧酒哩！今晚上，指挥部又要在学校院子里开批判大会。不用说，这会议还得要他主持。治功是总指挥，他要在开头和结尾讲话；高虎虽说也是个副总指挥，但年轻，只管民兵小分队的事，开这种会一般只负责维持会场秩序，以防阶级敌人捣乱破坏。 \n　　玉亭本来吃完饭就准备和凤英一起过金家湾那边去。但他想起要给他哥打个“政治招呼”。因为满银被“劳教”了，他哥今晚上的批判会一定要去，好让公社领导看见他拥护对女婿实行无产阶级专政。 \n　　他一想起王满银的事，心里就不痛快。无论如何，这小子也算和他沾点亲，这使他这个副总指挥多少有点不光彩。如果他哥能正确对待这事，也许他在台上还能站得踏实一些。可是，他专门去提醒他哥要识时务，他哥却死牛顶墙，不给他带这个面子。唉，他孙玉亭总不能对他哥也实行无产阶级专政…… \n　　现在，玉亭抽着刚从他哥烟布袋里挖来的旱烟，已经过了东拉河，走到庙坪枣树林的小土路上了。他现在还不能直接到小学去。他要去找一回他们大队的副书记金俊山，商量一点事。本来这种事要是书记田福堂在，他就不会去找金俊山。书记去公社开会，不在村里，他现在只能去找金俊山商量。 \n　　这事说起来也不大，但是件伤人事，最好不要叫他孙玉亭一个人当鬼子孙！ \n　　事情是这样的：今天下午收工时，总指挥徐治功对他说，晚上的批判会，各村都有批判对象，就是双水村没有。难道双水村连一个阶级敌人也没有吗？徐主任说的也是。毛主席说阶级斗争无处不有处处有，他们双水村怎么能没有呢？但双水村谁是阶级敌人，他一时又想不出来。 \n　　“哼，叫金俊山去想吧！”玉亭在心里说。 \n　　他现在一路走，心里还在盘算这事。他想他得先在心中有个数。万一老狐狸金俊山耍滑头，这事归根结底还得他来办。他是副总指挥，金俊山又\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙玉亭<|>PERSON<|>孙玉亭 is the deputy
