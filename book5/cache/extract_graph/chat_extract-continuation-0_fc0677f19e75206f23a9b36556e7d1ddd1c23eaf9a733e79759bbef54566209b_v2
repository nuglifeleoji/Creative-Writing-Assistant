想像的要复杂得多。”汪淼说。\n　　“相反，你得出这个印象，是因为‘科学边界’涉及的东西比你想象的更基础。”\n　　绝望的汪淼没有告辞起身就走，申玉菲默默地一直送他到庭院的大门处，并看着他坐进出租车。正在这时，另一辆汽车疾驰而来，在门前刹住了。一个男人下车，借着别墅中透出的灯光，汪淼一眼就认出了他。\n　　这人是潘寒，是“科学边界”里最著名的人物之一。作为一名生物学家，他成功地预言了长期食用转基因农产品造成的后代遗传畸形，还预言了转基因作物可能造成的生态灾难。与那些空洞地危言耸听的学者不同，他的预言充满了具体的细节，且都一一精确兑现，其准确度达到令人震惊的程度，以至于有传言说他来自未来。\n　　他使自己闻名于世的另一个创举，是创建了国内第一个实验社会。与西方那些旨在回归自然的乌托邦社团不同，他的“中华田园”不是处于荒野之地，而是置身于最大的城市中。社团没有一分钱财产，包括食物在内的所有生活用品，均来自城市垃圾。与人们最初的预想不同， “中华田园”不但生存下来，而且迅速壮大，其固定成员已达三千多人，不定期到其中体验生活的人更是不计其数。\n　　以这两个成功为基础，潘寒的社会思想也日益具有影响力。他认为，科技革命是人类社会的一种病变，技术的爆炸性发展与癌细胞的飞速扩散相当，最终的结果都是耗尽有机体的养分，破坏器官，导致其寄宿体的死亡。他主张废除那些“粗暴的”技术，如化石能源和核电，保留“温和的”技术，如太阳能和小水电。将大城市逐步解散，人口均匀分布于自给自足的小村镇中，以“温和技术”为基础，建立“新农业社会”。\n　　“他在吗?”潘寒指指别墅的二楼问。\n　　申玉菲没有回答，沉默地挡在他面前。\n　　“我要警告他，当然也要警告你，别逼我们!”潘寒冷冷地说。\n　　申玉菲仍没回答他，只是对出租车里的汪淼说： “走吧，没事。”然后示意司机开车。车发动后，汪淼再也没有听到他们说什么，他回头远远地看到，灯光下申玉菲一直没让潘寒走进别墅。\n　　回到家已是深夜，汪淼在小区的门口走下出租车，一辆黑色桑塔纳紧贴着他刹住，车窗摇下，一股烟喷了出来，是大史，粗壮的身躯将驾驶座挤得满满的。\n　　“哇，汪教授，汪院士!这两天过得可好?”\n　　“你在跟踪我?真无聊!”\n　　“别误会，我要是直直开过去不就完了，讲个礼貌打个招呼你还当成驴肝肺了。”大史露出他的特色傻笑，一副无赖相，\n######################\nOutput:",
