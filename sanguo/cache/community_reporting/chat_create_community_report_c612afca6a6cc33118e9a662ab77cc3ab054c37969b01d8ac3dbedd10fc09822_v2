He is primarily recognized for his alleged plot against Cao Cao, which included an attempt to poison him. This act of defiance ultimately led to Ji Ping's capture, where he was subjected to torture before facing execution.\n\nIn addition to his political entanglements, Ji Ping is also noted for his medical expertise, hailing from Luoyang. His skills as a physician contributed to his prominence, allowing him to navigate the complex social and political landscape of the era. Despite his medical background, Ji Ping's legacy is heavily overshadowed by his controversial actions against Cao Cao, marking him as a significant yet tragic figure in the historical narrative. \n\nOverall, Ji Ping embodies the duality of a skilled healer and a political conspirator, illustrating the intricate interplay between medicine and power during a tumultuous period in history.\",5\n943,QIN QINGTONG,,2\n948,EXECUTION,\"The term \"\"EXECUTION\"\" refers to pivotal events in the historical context of political power struggles, particularly during the Three Kingdoms period in China. Two notable executions are highlighted: the execution of Cao Shuang and his associates, and the execution of Ji Ping.\n\nThe execution of Cao Shuang, a prominent figure in the court of the Cao Wei state, marks a critical turning point in the political landscape of the time. This event signifies the end of Cao Shuang's political influence and the subsequent rise of Sima Yi, who would become a key player in the power dynamics of the era. The downfall of Cao Shuang illustrates the intense rivalries and the often brutal nature of political maneuvering during this period, as factions vied for control over the state.\n\nSimilarly, the execution of Ji Ping serves as another significant event that underscores the harsh political climate of the time. Ji Ping's execution reflects the ruthless measures taken by those in power to eliminate threats and consolidate their authority. This event, like that of Cao Shuang, highlights the perilous nature of political life in the Three Kingdoms, where loyalty could swiftly turn to betrayal, and the consequences of political rivalry could be fatal.\n\nTogether, these executions exemplify the tumultuous and often violent nature of political life during the Three Kingdoms period, illustrating how power struggles led to significant shifts in influence and authority. The narratives surrounding these events reveal the lengths to which individuals would go to secure their positions and the dire consequences that could follow for those who fell from favor.\",2\n944,QIN QING TONG,Qin Qing Tong is a character who is brought forth as a witness in the political conflict involving Cao Cao and his adversaries.,3\n942,YUN YING,Yun Ying is a concubine who was involved in a private conversation with Qin Qingtong.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1400,JI PING,QIN QINGTONG,\"Ji Ping ordered the capture of Qin Qingtong after discovering him in a private conversation, indicating a relationship of authority and punishment.\",7\n1407,JI PING,EXECUTION,Ji Ping's execution is a direct consequence of his defiance against Cao Cao and the political machinations at play,7\n1408,QIN QING TONG,COURT,Qin Qing Tong's testimony is presented in the context of the court's proceedings against Ji Ping,7\n1402,YUN YING,QIN QINGTONG,\"Qin Qingtong and Yun Ying were involved in a private conversation, suggesting a relationship of intimacy or secrecy.\",3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
