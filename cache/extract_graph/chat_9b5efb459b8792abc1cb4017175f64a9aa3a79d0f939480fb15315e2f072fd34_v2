Why couldn’t a Mentat Reverend Mother act from that knowledge?\n“Do you refuse counsel?” That was Tamalane. Was she siding with Bell?\n“When have | ever refused counsel?” Odrade let her outrage show. “I am refusing another of Bell’s Archival merry-go-rounds.”\nBellonda intruded. “Then, in reality—”\n“Bell! Don’t talk to me about reality!” Let her simmer in that! Reverend Mother and Mentat! There is no reality. Only our own order imposed on everything. A basic Bene Gesserit dictum.\nThere were times (and this was one of them) when Odrade wished she had been born in an earlier era—a Roman matron in the long pax of the aristocrats, or a much- pampered Victorian. But she was trapped by time and circumstances.\nTrapped forever?\nMust face that possibility. The Sisterhood might have only a future confined to secret hideaways, always fearing discovery. The future of the hunted. And here at Central we may be allowed no more than one mistake.\n“I’ve had enough of this inspection!” Odrade called for private transport and hurried them back to her workroom.\nWhat will we do if the hunters come upon us here?\nEach of them had her own scenario, a little playlet full of planned reactions. But every Reverend Mother was sufficiently a realist to know her playlet might be more hindrance than help.\nIn the workroom, morning light harshly revealing on everything around them, Odrade sank into her chair and waited for Tamalane and Bellonda to take their seats.\nNo more of those damned analysis sessions. She really needed access to something better than Archives, better than anything they had ever used before. Inspiration. Odrade rubbed her legs, feeling muscles tremble. She had not slept well for days. This inspection left her feeling frustrated.\nOne mistake could end us and I am about to commit us to a no-return decision.\nAm I being too tricky?\nHer advisors argued against tricky solutions. They said the Sisterhood must move with steady assurance, the ground ahead known in advance. Everything they did lay counterpoised by the disaster awaiting them at the slightest misstep.\nAnd I am on the tightrope over the chasm.\nDid they have room to experiment, to test possible solutions? They all played that game. Bell and Tam screened a constant flow of suggestions but nothing more effective than their atomic Scattering.\n“We must be prepared to kill Idaho at the slightest sign he is a Kwisatz Haderach,” Bellonda said.\n“Don’t you have work to do? Get out of here, both of you!”\nAs they stood, the workroom around Odrade took on an alien feeling. What was wrong? Bellonda stared down at her with that awful look of censure. Tamalane appeared more wise than she could possibly be.\nWhat is it about this room?\nThe workroom would have been recognized for its function by humans from pre-space history. What felt so alien? A worktable was a worktable and the chairs were in convenient positions. Bell and Tam preferred chairdogs. Those would have seemed odd to the early human in Other Memory she suspected was coloring her view. The ridulian crystals might glisten strangely, the light pulsing in them and blinking. Messages dancing above the table might be Surprising. Instruments of her labors could appear strange to an early human sharing her awareness.\nBut it felt alien to me.\n“Are you all right, Dar?” Tam spoke with concern.\nOdrade waved her away but neither woman moved.\nThings were happening in her mind that could not be blamed on the long hours and insufficient rest. This was not the first time she had felt she worked in alien surroundings. The previous night while eating a snack at this table, the surface littered with assignment orders as it was now, she had found herself just sitting and staring at uncompleted work.\nWhich Sisters could be spared from what posts for this terrible Scattering? How could they improve survival chances of the few sandtrout the Scattered Sisters took? What was a proper allotment of melange? Should they wait before sending more Sisters into the unknown? Wait for the possibility that Scytale could be induced to tell them how axlotl tanks produced the spice?\nOdrade recalled that the alien feeling had occurred to her as she chewed on a sandwich. She had looked at it, opening\nit slightly. What is this thing I’m eating? Chicken liver and onions on some of the best Chapterhouse bread.\nQuestioning her own routines, that was part of this alien sensation.\n“You look ill,” Bellonda said.\n“Just fatigue,” Odrade lied. They knew she was lying but would they challenge her? “You both must be equally tired.” Affection in her tone.\nBell was not satisfied. “You set a bad example!”\n“What? Me?” The jesting was not lost on Bell.\n“You know damned well you do!”\n“It’s your displays of affection,” Tamalane said.\n“Even for Bell.”\n“|I don’t want your damned affection! It’s wrong.”\n“Only if I let it rule my decisions, Bell. Only then.”\nBellonda’s voice fell to a husky whisper. “Some think you're a dangerous romantic, Dar. You know what that could do.”\n“Ally Sisters with me for other than our survival. Is that what you mean?”\n“Sometimes you give me a headache, Dar!”\n“It’s my duty and right to give you a headache. When your head fails to ache, you become careless. Affections bother you but hates don’t.”\n“I know my flaw.”\nYou couldn’t be a Reverend Mother and not know it.\nThe workroom once more had become a familiar place but now Odrade knew a source of her alien feelings. She was thinking of this place as part of ancient history, viewing it as she might when it was long gone. As it certainly would be if her plan succeeded. She knew what she had to do now. Time to reveal the first step.\nCareful.\nYes, Tar, I’m as cautious as you were.\nTam and Bell might be old but their minds were sharp when necessity required it.\nOdrade fixed her gaze on Bell. “Patterns, Bell. It is our pattern not to offer violence for violence.” Raising a hand to stop Bell’s response. “Yes, violence builds more violence and the pendulum swings until the violent ones are shattered.”\n“What are you thinking?” Tam demanded.\n“Perhaps we should consider baiting the bull more strongly.”\n“We dare not. Not yet.”\n“But we also dare not sit here witlessly waiting for them to find us. Lampadas and our other disasters tell us what will happen when they come. When, not if.”\nAs she spoke, Odrade sensed the chasm beneath her, the nightmare hunter with the axe ever nearer. She wanted to sink into the nightmare, turning there to identify the one who stalked them, but dared not. That had been the mistake of the Kwisatz Haderach.\nYou do not see that future, you create it.\nTamalane wanted to know why Odrade raised this issue. “Have you changed your mind, Dar?”\n“Our ghola-Teg is ten years old.”\n“Much too young for us to attempt restoring his original memories,” Bellonda said.\n“Why have we recreated Teg if not for violent uses?” Odrade asked. “Oh, yes!” As Tam started to object. “Teg did not always solve our problems with violence. The peaceful Bashar could deflect enemies with reasonable words.”\nTam spoke musingly. “But Honored Matres may never negotiate.”\n“Unless we can drive them to extremis.”\n“I think you are proposing to move too fast,” Bellonda said. Trust Bell to reach a Mentat summation.\nOdrade drew in a deep breath and looked down at her worktable. It had come at last. On that morning when she had removed the baby ghola from his obscene “tank,” she had sensed this moment waiting for her. Even then she had\nknown she would put this ghola into the crucible before his time. Ties of blood notwithstanding.\nReaching beneath her table, Odrade touched a call field. Her two councillors stood silently waiting. They knew she was about to say something important. One thing a Mother Superior could be sure of—her Sisters listened to her with great care, with an intensity that would have gratified someone more ego-bound than a Reverend Mother.\n“Politics,” Odrade said.\nThat snapped them to attention! A loaded word. When you entered Bene Gesserit politics, marshaling your powers for the rise to eminence, you became a prisoner of responsibility. You saddled yourself with duties and decisions that bound you to the lives of those who depended on you. This was what really tied the Sisterhood to their Mother Superior. That one word told councillors and the watchdogs the First-Among-Equals had reached a decision.\nThey all heard the small scuffling sound of someone arriving outside the workroom door. Odrade touched the white plate in the near right corner of her table. The door behind her opened and Streggi stood there awaiting the Mother Superior’s orders.\n“Bring him,” Odrade said.\n“Yes, Mother Superior.” Almost emotionless. A very promising acolyte, that Streggi.\nShe stepped out of sight and returned leading Miles Teg by the hand. The boy’s hair was quite blond but streaked with darker lines that said the light coloration would go dark when he matured. His face was narrow, nose just beginning to show that hawkish angularity so characteristic of Atreides males. His blue eyes moved alertly taking in room and occupants with expectant curiosity.\n“Wait outside, please, Streggi.”\nOdrade waited for the door to close.\nThe boy stood looking at Odrade with no sign of impatience.\n“Miles Teg, ghola,” Odrade said. “You remember Tamalane and Bellonda, of course.”\nHe favored the two women with a short glance but remained silent, apparently unmoved by the intensity of their inspection.\nTamalane frowned. She had disagreed from the first with calling this child a ghola. Gholas were grown from cells of a cadaver. This was a clone, just as Scytale was a clone.\n“lam going to send him into the no-ship with Duncan and Murbella,” Odrade said. “Who better than Duncan to restore Miles to his original memories?”\n“Poetic justice,” Bellonda agreed. She did not speak her objections although Odrade knew they would come out when the boy had gone. Too young!\n“What does she mean, poetic justice?” Teg asked. His voice had a piping quality.\n“When the Bashar was on Gammu, he restored Duncan’s original memories.”\n“Is it really painful?”\n“Duncan found it so.”\nSome decisions must be ruthless.\nOdrade thought that a great barrier to accepting the fact that you could make your own decisions. Something she would not be required to explain to Murbella.\nHow do I soften the blow?\nThere were times when you could not soften it; in fact when it was kinder to rip off the bandages in one swift shot of agony.\n“Can this .. . this Duncan Idaho really give me back my memories from... before?”\n“He can and he will.”\n“Are we not being too precipitous?” Tamalane asked.\n“I’ve been studying accounts of the Bashar,” Teg said. “He was a famous military man and a Mentat.”\n“And you’re proud of that, | suppose?” Bell was taking out her objections on the boy.\n“Not especially.” He returned her gaze without flinching. “I think of him as someone else. Interesting, though.”\n“Someone else,” Bellonda muttered. She looked at Odrade with ill-concealed disagreement. “\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9b5efb459b8792abc1cb4017175f64a9aa3a79d0f939480fb15315e2f072fd34_v2"}
