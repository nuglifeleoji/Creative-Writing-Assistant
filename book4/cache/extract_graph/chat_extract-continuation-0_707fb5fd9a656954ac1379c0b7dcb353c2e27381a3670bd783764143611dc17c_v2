\n　　于是，孙玉厚老汉“叭叭”两下把烟灰在鞋帮子上磕掉，开门去找他弟孙玉亭；他要让玉亭给少平写封信，然后托开邮车的金俊海顺路捎到黄原，让少平赶快回家来！ \n                  第19章\n　　黄原揽工的孙少平，已经又换到了另一个地方干活。 \n　　这次他是在城里一个单位的建筑工地上当小工——这单位要修建几十孔“驳壳窑洞”，因此几个月内他不会“失业”。他仍然背石头。 \n　　他本以为，他的脊背经过几个月的考验，不再怕重压；而没想到又一次溃烂了——旧伤虽然结痂，但不是痊愈，因此经不住重创，再一次被弄得皮破肉绽！ \n　　这是私人承包的国营单位建筑，工程大，人员多，包工头为赚大钱，恨不得拿工匠当牛马使用；天不明就上工，天黑得看不见才收工。因为工期长，所有的大工小工都是经过激烈竞争才上了这工程的。没有人敢偷懒。谁要稍不合工头的心意，立刻就被打发了。在这样的工程上要站住脚，每一个工匠都得证明自己是最强壮最能干的。 \n　　少平尽管脊背的皮肉已经稀巴烂，但他忍受着疼痛，拼命支撑这超强度的劳动，每一回给箍窑的大工背石头，他狠心地比别的小工都背得重。这使他赢得了站场工头的好感。不久，总包工头宣布给他和另外两个小工每天增加二毛工钱。 \n　　晚上收工以后，年纪大的匠人碗一撂就倒头睡了。年轻的小工们还有精力跑到街上去看一场电影。 \n　　少平倒不急着睡，也不去街上；他通常都蹲在院子里的路灯下看一会书。上次他给诗人贾冰还那本《牛虻》时，贾老师主动帮助给他在黄原图书馆办了临时借书证，这使他能象以前那样重新又和书生活在一起。只不过现在除过熬苦不说，也没有多少闲时间，一天只能看一二十页。一本书常常得一个星期才能看完。 \n　　但无论如何，这使他无比艰辛的生活有了一个安慰。书把他从沉重的生活中拉出来，使他的精神不致被劳动压得麻木不仁。通过不断地读书，少平认识到，只有一个人对世界了解得更广大，对人生看得更深刻，那么，他才有可能对自己所处的艰难和困苦有更高意义的理解；甚至也会心平气静地对待欢乐和幸福。 \n　　孙少平现在迷上了一些传记文学，他已经读完了《马克思传》、《斯大林传》、《居里夫人传》和世界上一些作家的传记。 \n　　他读这些书，并不是指望自己也成为伟人。但他从这些书中体会到，连伟人的一生都充满了那么大的艰辛，一个平凡的人吃点苦又算得了什么呢？他一生不可能做\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙玉厚<|>PERSON<|>孙玉厚 is an
