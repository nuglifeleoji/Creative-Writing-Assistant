曾是她和杨卫宁的家，现在空荡荡的，只有腹中的孩子陪伴着她。外面的寒夜中，大兴安岭的寒风呼啸着，风中隐隐传来远处齐家屯的鞭炮声。孤寂像一只巨掌压着叶文洁，她觉得自己被越压越小，最后缩到这个世界看不到的一个小角落去了……就在这时，响起了敲门声，开门后叶文洁首先看到哨兵，他身后有几支松明子的火光在寒风中摇曳着，举火把的是一群孩子，他们脸冻得通红，狗皮帽上有冰碴子，进屋后带着一股寒气。有两个男孩子冻得最厉害，他们穿得很单薄，却用两件厚棉衣裹着一个什么东西抱在怀里，把棉衣打开来，是一个大瓷盆，里面的酸菜猪肉馅饺子还冒着热汽。\n     那一年，在向太阳发出信号八个月后，叶文洁临产了，由于胎位不正，她的身体又很弱，基地卫生所没有条件接生，就把她送到了最近的镇医院。\n     这竟是叶文洁的一个鬼门关，她遇到了难产，在剧痛和大出血后陷人昏迷，冥冥中只看到三个灼热刺眼的太阳围绕着她缓缓转动，残酷地炙烤着她。这情景持续了很长时间后，她在朦胧中想到，这可能就是她永恒的归宿了，这就是她的地狱，三个太阳构成的地狱之火将永远灼烧着她，这是她因那个超级背叛受到的惩罚。她陷入强烈的恐惧中，不是为自己，而是为孩子——孩子还在腹中吗？还是随着她来到这地狱中蒙受永恒的痛苦？不知过了多久，三个太阳渐渐后退了，退到一定距离后突然缩小，变成了晶莹的飞星，周围凉爽了，痛疼也在减轻，她终于醒了过来。\n     叶文洁听到耳边的一声啼哭，她吃力地转过脸，看到了婴儿粉嘟嘟、湿乎乎的小睑儿。\n     医生告诉叶文洁，她出血达两千多毫升，齐家屯的几十位农民来给她献血，他们中很多人的孩子她都辅导过，但更多的是素昧平生，只是听孩子和他们的父母说起过她，要不是他们的话，她死定了。\n     以后的日子成了问题，叶文洁产后虚弱，在基地自己带孩子是不可能的，她又无亲无故。这时，齐家屯的一对老两口来找基地领导，说他们可以把叶文洁和孩子带回家去照顾。男的原来是个猎户，也采些药材，后来周围的林子越来越少，就种地了，但人们还是叫他齐猎头儿。他们有两儿两女，女孩都嫁出去了，一个儿子在外地当兵，另一个成家\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
