This group targeted him for his teachings, which they deemed counter-revolutionary and reactionary. Specifically, 叶哲泰 was criticized for incorporating concepts of relativity into his educational materials, as well as for his discussions on quantum mechanics and the Big Bang theory. The 红卫兵 viewed these scientific ideas as reflective of bourgeois views that contradicted the revolutionary ideology they were promoting.\n\nThe Red Guards' campaign against 叶哲泰 included public denunciations and threats, which were common tactics used during this tumultuous period to suppress intellectuals and dissenting voices. Their actions were part of a broader effort to eliminate perceived enemies of the state and to enforce a strict adherence to Maoist principles. As a result, 叶哲泰's academic contributions were overshadowed by the political climate of fear and repression, leading to a significant impact on his career and personal safety during the Cultural Revolution.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754801732, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 445, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
