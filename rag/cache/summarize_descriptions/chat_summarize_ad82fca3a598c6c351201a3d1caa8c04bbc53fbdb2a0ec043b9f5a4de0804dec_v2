His eagerness contrasts with the skepticism or disapproval of others, further emphasizing his divergence from traditional Fremen ideals. While his exact motivations remain ambiguous, his actions and appearance suggest he may serve as a harbinger of significant—and potentially unsettling—developments in the story.  \n\nCombining these descriptions, Teishar emerges as a complex figure: a loyal aide whose devotion to authority (whether to Garun or the God Emperor) marks him as a symbol of cultural shift, while his eerie presence foreshadows deeper narrative consequences.
