The interactions between 罗辑 and the 三体人 delve into profound themes, including discussions about the universe, existence, and the concept of love, highlighting the stark differences in worldview between the two species.\n\nThe 三体人 are not merely antagonists; they also serve as a lens through which human nature and societal issues are examined. Their presence in the narrative raises questions about morality, survival, and the future of humanity in the face of superior intelligence.
