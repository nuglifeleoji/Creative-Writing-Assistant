�人马座星系生存下去，避免其对太阳系的人侵，是两全其美的理想结局。他们天真地以为，解决物理上的三体问题就能达到这一目标，同时拯救三体和地球两个世界。其实这一想法也未必天真，三体文明本身在相当漫长的时间里也抱有这个想法，解决三体问题的努力贯穿于三体文明的几百次轮回之中。拯救派中有较深物理学和数学背景的人，都有过解决三体问题的尝试，即使在得知三体问题从数学本质上不可解后，仍然没有停止努力，解决三体问题的努力已成为三体教的一种宗教仪式。虽然拯救派中不乏一流的物理学家和数学家，但这种研究一直没有重大成果，倒是像魏成这样与三体叛军和三体教无关的天才，无意中取得了令他们产生很大希望的突破。\n     降临派和拯救派一直处于尖锐的对立状态，降临派认为，拯救派是对地球三体运动重大的威胁。这种看法也不是没有道理，正是通过拯救派中一些有责任心的人士，各国政府才逐渐得知三体叛军令人震惊的背景。两派在组织中实力相当，双方的武装力量已经发展到兵戎相见的程度。叶文洁运用自己的威信极力弥合组织中的裂痕，但效果不大。\n     随着三体运动的发展，三体叛军中出现了第三个派别：幸存派。当人侵太阳系的外星舰队的存在被确切证实后，在那场终极战争中幸存下来是人们最自然的愿望。当然，战争是四百五十年之后的事了，与自己的此生无关，但很多人希望如果人类战败，自己在四个半世纪后的子孙能幸存下来。现在就为三体侵略者服务，显然有利于这个目标的实现。与另外两个主流派别比较，幸存派成员都来自较低的社会阶层，且东方人（特别是中国人）居多，他们目前的数量还很少，但人数在急剧增长，在三体文化日益普及的未来，将会成为一支不可忽视的力量。\n     人类文明自身缺陷产生的异化力量、对更高等文明的向往和崇拜、让子孙在终极战争后幸存的强烈欲望，这三股强大的动力推动地球三体运动迅速发展，当它被察觉时，已成燎原之势。\n     而这时，外星文明还远在四光年之外的太空深处，与人类世界还隔着四个半世纪的漫漫航程，它们送到地球的，只有那一束电波。\n     比尔·马修的“接触符号”理论，得到了令人心悸的完美证实。\n     30．两个质子\n     审问者：现在开始今天的调查。希望你能像上次一样配合。\n     叶文洁：我知道的你们都知道了，有许多事情反而需要你来告诉我。\n     审问者：不是这样，我们首先想知道的是，在三体世界发往地球的信息中，降临派所截留的那部分内容是什么？\n     叶文洁：不知道，他\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
