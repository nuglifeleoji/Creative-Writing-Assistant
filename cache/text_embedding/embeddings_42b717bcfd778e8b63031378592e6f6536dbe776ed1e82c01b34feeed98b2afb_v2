it was still there catching things to be digested. Twitch a trigger strand and Bell came running, mandibles flexing in anticipation. The twitch-words were “Archives” and “Analysis.”\nSeeing Bellonda in this light, Murbella saw the wisdom in the ways Odrade had employed her, flaws as valuable as the strengths. When Murbella finished the report, Bellonda still stood there in characteristic attitude.\nMurbella recognized that Bellonda looked on all who Summoned her as ones who had not measured up, people who called on Archives for frivolous reasons and had to be set straight. Frivolity: Bellonda’s béte noire. Murbella found this amusing.\nMurbella kept amusement masked while enjoying Bellonda. The way to deal with her was to be scrupulous. Nothing to subtract from strengths. This report was a model of concise and pertinent argument. She made her points with few embellishments, just enough to reveal her own conclusions.\n“Does it amuse you to summon me?” Bellonda asked.\nShe’s sharper than she was! Did I summon her? Not in so many words but she knows when she’s needed. She says here our Sisters must be models of meekness. Mother Superior may be anything she needs to be but not so the rest of the Sisterhood.\nMurbella touched the report. “A starting point.”\n“Then we should start before your friends find the comeye center.” Bellonda sank into her chairdog with familiar confidence. “Tam’s gone but | could send for Sheeana.”\n“Where is she?”\n“At the ship. Studying a collection of worms in the Great Hold, says any of us can be taught to control them.”\n“Valuable if true. Leave her. What of Scytale?”\n“Still in the ship. Your friends haven’t found him yet. We're keeping him under wraps.”\n“Let’s continue that. He’s a good reserve bargaining chip. And they’re not my friends, Bell. How are the Rabbi and his party?”\n“Comfortable but worried. They Know Honored Matres are here.”\n“Keep them under wraps.”\n“It’s uncanny. A different voice but | hear Dar.”\n“An echo in your head.”\nBellonda actually laughed.\n“Now here’s what you must spread among the Sisters. We act with extreme delicacy while showing ourselves as people to admire and emulate. ‘You Honored Matres may not choose to live as we live but you can learn our strengths.’”\n“Ahhhhhh.”\n“It comes down to ownership. Honored Matres are owned by things. ‘I want that place, that bauble, that person.’ Take what you want. Use it until you tire of it.”\n“While we go along our path admiring what we see.”\n“And there’s our flaw. We don’t give ourselves easily. Fear of love and affection! To be self-possessed has its own greed. ‘See what | have? You can’t have it unless you follow my ways!’ Never take that attitude with Honored Matres.”\n“Are you telling me we have to love them?”\n“How else can we make them admire us? That was Jessica’s victory. When she gave, she gave it all. So much bottled up by our ways and then that overwhelming wash: everything given. It’s irresistible.”\n“We don’t compromise that easily.”\n“No more do Honored Matres.”\n“That’s the way of their bureaucratic origins!”\n“Yet, theirs is a training ground for following the path of least resistance.”\n“You're confusing me, Da... Murbella.”\n“Have | said we should compromise? Compromise weakens us, and we know there are problems compromise cannot solve, decisions we must make no matter how bitter.”\n“Pretend to love them?”\n“That’s a beginning.”\n“It’ll be a bloody union, this joining of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre.”\n“I suggest we Share as widely as possible. We may lose people while Honored Matres are learning.”\n“A marriage made on the battlefield.”\nMurbella stood, thinking of Duncan in the no-ship, remembering the ship as she had seen it last. There it was finally, not hidden to any sense. A lump of strange machinery, oddly grotesque. A wild conglomeration of protrusions and juttings with no apparent purpose. Hard to imagine the thing lifting on its own power, enormous as that was, and vanishing into space.\nVanishing into space!\nShe saw the shape of Duncan’s mental mosaic.\nA piece that cannot be moved! Get in tune... Don’t think; do it!\nWith an abruptness that chilled her, she knew his decision.\nWhen you think to take determination of your fate into your own hands, that is the moment you can be crushed. Be cautious. Allow for surprises. When we create, there are always other forces at work.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nfd MI ove with extreme care,” Sheeana had warned him. Idaho did not think he needed warning but appreciated it nonetheless.\nPresence of Honored Matres on Chapterhouse eased his task. They made the ship’s Proctors and other guards nervous. Murbella’s orders kept her former Sisters out of the ship but everyone knew the enemy was here. Scanner relays showed a seemingly endless stream of lighters disgorging Honored Matres on the Flat. Most of the new arrivals appeared curious about that monstrous no-ship sitting there but no one disobeyed Great Honored Matre.\n“Not while she’s alive,” Idaho muttered where Proctors could hear him. “They have a tradition of assassinating their leaders to replace them. How long can Murbella hold out?”\nComeyes did his work for him. He knew his muttering would spread through the ship.\nSheeana came to him in his workroom shortly afterward and made a show of disapproval. “What are you trying to do, Duncan? You’re upsetting people.”\n“Go back to your worms!”\n“Duncan!”\n“Murbella’s playing a dangerous game! She’s all that stands between us and disaster.”\nHe already had voiced this worry to Murbella. It was not new to the watchers but reinforcement made everyone who\nheard him edgy—comeye monitors in Archives, ship guards, everyone.\nExcept Honored Matres. Murbella was keeping them out of Bellonda’s Archives.\n“Time for that later,” she said.\nSheeana had her cue. “Duncan, either stop feeding our worries or tell us what we should do. You’re a Mentat. Function for us.”\nAhhh, the Great Mentat performs for all to see.\n“What you should do is obvious but it’s not up to me. | can’t leave Murbella.”\nBut I can be taken away.\nNow it was up to Sheeana. She left him and went to spread her own brand of change.\n“We have the Scattering for our example.”\nBy evening, she had the Reverend Mothers in the ship neutralized and gave him a hand-signal that they could take the next step.\n“They will follow my lead.”\nWithout intending it, the Missionaria had set the stage for Sheeana’s ascendancy. Most Sisters knew the power latent in her. Dangerous. But it was there.\nUnused power was like a marionette with visible strings, nobody holding them. A compelling attraction: / could make it dance.\nFeeding the deception, he called Murbella.\n“When will | see you?”\n“Duncan, please.” Even in projection, she looked harried. “I’m busy. You know the pressures. l'Il be out in a few days.”\nProjection showed Honored Matres in the background scowling at this odd behavior in their leader. Any Reverend Mother could read their faces.\n“Has Great Honored Matre gone soft? That’s nothing but a man out there!”\nWhen he broke off, Idaho emphasized what every monitor on the ship had seen. “She’s in danger! Doesn’t she know\nit?”\nAnd now, Sheeana, it’s up to you.\nSheeana had the key to reinstate the ship’s flight controls. The mines were gone. No one could destroy the ship at the last instant with a signal to hidden explosives. There was only the human cargo to consider, Teg especially.\nTeg will see my choices. The others—the Rabbi's party and Scytale—will have to take their chances with us.\nThe Futars in their security cells did not worry him. Interesting animals but not significant at the moment. For that matter, he gave only a passing thought to Scytale. The little Tleilaxu remained under the eyes of guards, who were not relaxing their watch on him no matter their other worries.\nHe went to bed with a nervousness that had ready explanation for any watchdog in Archives.\nHis precious Murbella is in peril.\nAnd she was in peril but he could not protect her.\nMy very presence is a danger to her now.\nHe was up at dawn, back to the armory dismantling a weapons factory. Sheeana found him there and asked him to join her in the guard section.\nA handful of Proctors greeted them. The leader they had chosen did not surprise him. Garimi. He had heard about her performance at the Convocation. Suspicious. Worried. Ready to make her own gamble. She was a sober-faced woman. Some said she seldom smiled.\n“We have diverted the comeyes in this room,” Garimi said. “They show us having a snack and questioning you about weapons.”\nIdaho felt a knot in his stomach. Bell’s people would spot a simulation quickly. Especially a projected mock-up of himself.\nGarimi responded to his frown. “We have allies in Archives.”\nSheeana said: “We are here to ask if you wish to leave before we escape in this ship.”\nHis surprise was genuine.\nStay behind?\nHe had not considered it. Murbella was no longer his. The bond had been broken in her. She did not accept it. Not yet. But she would the first time she was asked to make a decision putting him in danger for Bene Gesserit purposes. Now, she merely stayed away from him more than was necessary.\n“You're going to Scatter?” he asked, looking at Garimi.\n“We'll save what we can. Voting with our feet, it was called once. Murbella is subverting the Bene Gesserit.”\nThere was the unspoken argument he had trusted to win them. Disagreement over Odrade’s gamble.\nIdaho took a deep breath. “I will go with you.”\n“No regrets!” Garimi warned.\n“That’s stupid!” he said, venting his repressed grief.\nGarimi would not have been surprised by that response from a Sister. Idaho shocked her and she was several seconds recovering. Honesty compelled her.\n“Of course it’s stupid. I’m sorry. You're sure you won’t stay? We owe you the chance to make your own decision.”\nBene Gesserit fastidiousness with those who served them loyally!\n“lll join you.”\nThe grief they saw on his face was not simulated. He wore it openly when he returned to his console.\nMy assigned position.\nHe did not try to hide his actions when he coded for the Ship’s ID circuits.\nAllies in Archives.\nThe circuits came flashing up on his projections—colored ribbons with a broken link into flight systems. The way around that breakage was visible after only a few moments’ study. Mentat observations had been prepared for it.\nMultiples through the core!\nIdaho sat back and waited.\nLift-off was a skull-rattling moment of blankness that stopped abruptly when they were far enough clear of the surface to engage nullfields and enter foldspace.\nIdaho watched his projection. There they were: the old couple in their garden setting! He saw the net shimmering in front of them, the man gest", " own decision.”\nBene Gesserit fastidiousness with those who served them loyally!\n“lll join you.”\nThe grief they saw on his face was not simulated.

There they were: the old couple in their garden setting! He saw the net shimmering in front of them, the man gesturing at it, smiling in round- faced satisfaction. They moved in a transparent overlay that revealed ship circuits behind them. The net grew larger—not lines but ribbons thicker than the projected circuits.\nThe man’s lips shaped words but there was no sound. “We expected you.”\nIdaho’s hands went to his console, fingers splayed in the comfield to grasp required elements of the circuit control. No time for niceties. Gross disruption. He was into the core within a second. From there, it was a simple matter to dump entire segments. Navigation went first. He saw the net begin to thin, the look of surprise on the man’s face. Nullfields were next. Idaho felt the ship lurching in foldspace. The net tipped, becoming elongated with the two watchers foreshortened and thinned. Idaho wiped out star-memory circuits, taking his own data with them.\nNet and watchers vanished.\nHow did I know they would be there?\nHe had no answer except a certainty rooted in the repeated visions.\nSheeana did not look up when he found her at the temporary flight-control board in the guard quarters. She was bent over the board, staring at it in consternation. The projection above her showed they had emerged from foldspace. Idaho recognized none of the visible star patterns but he had expected that.\nSheeana swiveled and looked at Garimi standing over her. “We've lost all data storage!”\nIdaho tapped his temple with a forefinger. “No we haven't.”\n“But it'll take years to recover even the essentials!” Sheeana protested. “What happened?”\n“We're an unidentifiable ship in an unidentifiable universe,” Idaho said. “Isn’t that what we wanted?”\nThere’s no secret to balance. You just have to feel the waves.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nM urbella felt that an age had passed since she recognized Duncan’s decision.\nVanish into space! Leave me!\nThe unvarying time sense of the Agony told her only seconds had elapsed since awareness of his intentions but she felt she had known this from the first.\nHe must be stopped!\nShe was reaching for her comboard when Central began to shudder. The quaking continued for an interminable time and subsided slowly.\nBellonda was on her feet. “What...”\n“The no-ship at the Flat has just lifted,” Murbella said.\nBellonda reached for the comboard but Murbella stopped her.\n“It's gone.” She must not see my pain. “But who...” Bellonda fell silent. She had her own\nassessments of consequences and saw then what Murbella Saw.\nMurbella sighed. She had all of the curses of history at her disposal and wanted none of them.\n“At lunchtime, | will eat in my private dining room with councillors and | want you present,” Murbella said. “Tell Duana oyster stew again.”\nBellonda started to protest but all that came out was: “Again?”\n“You will recall | ate alone downstairs last night?” Murbella resumed her seat.\nMother Superior has duties!\nThere were maps to change and rivers to follow and Honored Matres to domesticate.\nSome waves throw you, Murbella. But you get back up and go on with it. Seven times down, eight times up. You can balance on strange surfaces.\n| know, Dar. Willing participation in your dream.\nBellonda stared at her until Murbella said, “I made my councillors sit at a distance from me at dinner last night. It was strange—only the two tables in the whole dining room.”\nWhy do I continue this inane chatter? What excuses do | have for my extraordinary behavior?\n“We wondered why none of us were permitted in our own dining room,” Bellonda said.\n“To save your lives! But you should have seen their interest. | read their lips. Angelika said: ‘She’s eating some kind of stew. | heard her discussing it with the chef. Isn’t this a marvelous world we've acquired? We must sample that stew she ordered.’”\n“Samples,” Bellonda said. “I see.” Then: “You know, don’t you, Sheeana took the Van Gogh painting from. . . your sleeping chamber?”\nWhy does that hurt?\n“I noticed it was missing.”\n“Said she was borrowing it for her room in the ship.”\nMurbella’s lips went thin.\nDamn them! Duncan and Sheeana! Teg, Scytale... all of them gone and no way to follow. But we still have axlotl tanks and Idaho cells from our children. Not the same... but close. He thinks he’s escaped!\n“Are you all right, Murbella?” Concern in Bell’s voice.\nYou warned me about wild things, Dar, and I didn’t listen.\n“After we've eaten, | will take my councillors on an inspection tour of Central. Tell my acolyte l'Il want cider\nbefore retiring.”\nBellonda left, muttering. That was more like her.\nHow do you guide me now, Dar?\nYou want guidance? A guided tour of your life? Is that why | died?\nBut they took the Van Gogh, too!\nIs that what you’ll miss?\nWhy did they take it, Dar?\nCaustic laughter greeted this and Murbella was glad no one else heard.\nCan’t you see what she intends?\nThe Missionaria scheme!\nOh, more than that. It’s the next phase: Muad’Dib to Tyrant to Honored Matres to us to Sheeana... to what? Can’t you see it? The thing is right here at the lip of your thoughts. Accept it as you would swallow a bitter drink.\nMurbella shuddered.\nSee it? The bitter medicine of a Sheeana future? We once thought all medicines had to be bitter or they were not effective. No healing power in the sweet.\nMust it happen, Dar?\nSome will choke on that medicine. But the survivors may create interesting patterns.\nPaired opposites define your longings and those longings imprison you.\n— THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\nmm oe deliberately let them get away, Daniel!”\nThe old woman rubbed her hands down the stained front of her garden apron. It was a Summer morning around her, flowers blooming, birds calling from nearby trees. There was a misty look to the sky, a yellow radiance near the horizon.\n“Now, Marty, it was not deliberate,” Daniel said. He took off his porkpie hat and rubbed the bushy stubble of gray hair before replacing the hat. “He surprised me. | knew he Saw us but | didn’t suspect he saw the net.”\n“And | had such a nice planet picked out for them,” Marty said. “One of the best. A real test of their abilities.”\n“No use moaning about it,” Daniel said. “They're where we can’t touch them now. He was spread so thin, though, | expected to catch him easy.”\n“They had a Tleilaxu Master, too,” Marty said. “I saw him when they went under the net. | would have so liked to study another Master.”\n“Don’t see why. Always whistling at us, always making it necessary to stomp them down. | don’t like treating Masters that way and you know it! If it weren’t forthem.. .”\n“They’re not gods, Daniel.”\n“Neither are we.”\n“I still think you let them escape. You’re so anxious to prune your roses!”\n“What would you have said to the Master, anyway?” Daniel asked.\n“I was going to joke when he asked who we were. They always ask that. | was going to say: ‘What did you expect, God Himself with a flowing beard?’”\nDaniel chuckled. “That would’ve been funny. They have such a hard time accepting that Face Dancers can be independent of them.”\n“I don’t see why. It’s a natural consequence. They gave us the power to absorb the memories and experiences of other people. Gather enough of those and...”\n“It’s personas we take, Marty.”\n“Whatever. The Masters should’ve known we would gather enough of them one day to make our own decisions about our own future.”\n“And theirs?”\n“Oh, I'd have apologized to him after putting him in his place. You can do just so much managing of others, isn’t that right, Daniel?”\n“When you get that look on your face, Marty, | go prune my roses.” He went back to a line of bushes with verdant leaves and black blooms as large as his head.\nMarty called after him: “Gather up enough people and you get a big ball of knowledge, Daniel! That’s what I’d have told him. And those Bene Gesserit in that ship! I’d have told them how many of them | have. Ever notice how alienated they feel when we peek at them?”\nDaniel bent to his black roses.\nShe stared after him, hands on her hips.\n“Not to mention Mentats,” he said. “There were two of them on that ship—both gholas. You want to play with them?”\n“The Masters always try to control them, too,” she said.\n“That Master is going to have trouble if he tries to mess with that big one,” Daniel said, snipping off a ground shoot from the root stock of his roses. “My, this is a pretty one.”\n“Mentats, too!” Marty called. “I’d have told them. Dime a dozen, they are.”\n“Dimes? | don’t think they’d have understood that, Marty. The Reverend Mothers, yes, but not that big Mentat. He didn’t thin out that far back.”\n“You know what you let get away, Daniel?” she demanded, coming up beside him. “That Master had a nullentropy tube in his chest. Full of ghola cells, too!”\n“Tl saw it.”\n“That’s why you let them get away!”\n“Didn’t let them.” His pruning shears went snick-snick. “Gholas. He’s welcome to them.”\nHere is another book dedicated to Bev, friend, wife, dependable helper and the person who gave this one its title. The dedication is posthumous and the words below, written the morning after she died, should tell you something of her inspiration.\nO ne of the best things | can say about Bev is there was nothing in our life together | need forget, not even the graceful moment of her death. She gave me then the ultimate gift of her love, a peaceful passing she had spoken of without fear or tears, allaying thereby my own fears. What greater gift is there than to demonstrate you need not fear death?\nThe formal obituary would read: Beverly Ann Stuart Forbes Herbert, born October 20, 1926, Seattle, Washington; died 5:05 pm. February 7, 1984, at Kawaloa, Maui. | know that is as much", " went snick-snick. “Gholas.

February 7, 1984, at Kawaloa, Maui. | know that is as much formality as she would tolerate. She made me promise there would be no conventional funeral “with a preacher’s sermon and my body on display.” As she said: “l will not be in that body then but it deserves more dignity than such a display provides.”\nShe insisted | go no further than to have her cremated and scatter her ashes at her beloved Kawaloa “where | have felt so much peace and love.” The only ceremony—friends and loved ones to watch the scattering of her ashes during the singing of “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”\nShe knew there would be tears then as there are tears while | write these words but in her last days she often spoke of tears as futile. She recognized tears as part of our animal origins. The dog howls at the loss of its master.\nAnother part of human awareness dominated her life: Spirit. Not in any mawkish religious sense nor in anything\nmost Spiritualists would associate with the word. To Bev, it was the light shining from awareness onto everything she encountered. Because of this, | can say despite my grief and even within grief that joy fills my spirit because of the love she gave and continues to give me. Nothing in the sadness at her death is too high a price to pay for the love we shared.\nHer choice of a song to sing at the scattering of her ashes went to what we often said to each other—that she was my bridge and | was hers. That epitomizes our married life.\nWe began that sharing with a ceremony before a minister in Seattle on June 20, 1946. Our honeymoon was spent on a firewatch lookout atop Kelley Butte in Snoqualmie National Forest. Our quarters were twelve feet square with a cupola above only six feet square and most of that filled by the firefinder with which we located any smoke we saw.\nIn cramped quarters with a spring-powered Victrola and two portable typewriters taking up considerable space on the one table, we pretty well set the pattern of our life together: work to support music, writing and the other joys living provides.\nNone of this is to say we experienced constant euphoria. Far from it. We had moments of boredom, fears, and pains. But there was always time for laughter. Even at the end, Bev still could smile to tell me | had positioned her correctly on her pillows, that | had eased the aching of her back with a gentle massage and the other things necessary because she could no longer do them for herself.\nIn her final days, she did not want anyone but me to touch her. But our married life had created such a bond of love and trust she often said the things | did for her were as though she did them. Though | had to provide the most intimate care, the care you would give an infant, she did not feel offended nor that her dignity had been assaulted. When | picked her up in my arms to make her more comfortable or bathe her, Bev’s arms always went around my shoulders\nand her face nestled as it often had in the hollow of my neck.\nIt is difficult to convey the joy of those moments but | assure you it was there. Joy of the spirit. Joy of life even at death. Her hand was in mine when she died and the attending doctor, tears in his eyes, said the thing | and many others had said of her.\n“She had grace.”\nMany of those who saw that grace did not understand. | remember when we entered the hospital in the pre-dawn hours for the birth of our first son. We were laughing. Attendants looked at us with disapproval. Birth is painful and dangerous. Women die giving birth. Why are these people laughing?\nWe were laughing because the prospect of new life that was part of both of us filled us with such happiness. We were laughing because the birth was about to occur ina hospital built on the site of the hospital where Bev was born. What a marvelous continuity!\nOur laughter was infectious and soon others we met on the way to the delivery room were smiling. Disapproval became approval. Laughter was her grace note in moments of stress.\nHers was also the laughter of the constantly new. Everything she encountered had something new in it to excite her senses. There was a naivete about Bev that was, in its own way, a form of sophistication. She wanted to find what was good in everything and everyone. As a result, she brought out that response in others.\n“Revenge is for children,” she said. “Only people who are basically immature want it.”\nShe was known to call people who had offended her and plead with them to put away destructive feelings. “Let us be friends.” The source of none of the condolences that poured in after her death surprised me.\nIt was typical of her that she wanted me to call the radiologist whose treatment in 1974 was the proximate cause of her death and thank him “for giving me these ten beautiful years. Make sure he understands | know he did his best for me when I was dying of cancer. He took the state of the art to its limits and | want him to know my appreciation.”\nIs it any wonder that | look back on our years together with a happiness transcending anything words can describe? Is it any wonder I do not want or need to forget one moment of it? Most others merely touched her life at the periphery. | shared it in the most intimate ways and everything she did strengthened me. It would not have been possible for me to do what necessity demanded of me during the final ten years of her life, strengthening her in return, had she not given of herself in the preceding years, holding back nothing. | consider that to be my great good fortune and most miraculous privilege.\nFrank Herbert Port Townsend, WA April 6, 1984\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nFrank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga.
