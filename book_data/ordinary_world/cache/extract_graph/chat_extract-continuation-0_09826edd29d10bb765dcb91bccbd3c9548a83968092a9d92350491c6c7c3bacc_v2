\n　　郝红梅在往自己的书包装那五块手帕的一刹那间，产生了邪念——她没有时间来检讨她这行为的全部危险与可怕，便很快瞥了一眼那个封火炉的售货员，见他脊背朝着她，就闪电般伸出手在柜台上的那叠手帕上面抓了一把。在她还没来得及将手中的赃物塞进自己书包的时候，那售货员大概是凭第六感觉也闪电般转过身来！ \n　　于是，一切都完了……这个叫金光明的售货员，把贼娃子很快带到门市后面，交给了主任侯生才。 \n　　侯生才立即进行了审问。郝红梅痛哭流涕如实招了。 \n　　侯主任一听她是自己女儿一个班的同学，倒动了恻隐之心——说不定是他玉英的好朋友呢！ \n　　他于是让金光明先把这女娃娃引到他的办公室去，他自己要到家里向女儿问问这姑娘的情况。 \n　　侯主任走了以后，金光明也要回去吃饭，就把郝红梅领进他的办公室，门一锁，屁股一拧就回了家。 \n　　侯主任回到家里，一问女儿，才知道这个女贼平时就不是个好东西！又听说她还把玉英的救命恩人孙少平哄闪了一回，这就更不能轻饶她了！ \n　　他打发女儿到学校去，立刻把领导找到这儿来。哼！什么东西！这种贼娃子，干脆甭给发毕业证书，还要给档案里写上一笔！听说还是地主成份，这不是阶级斗争的新动向吗？ \n　　女儿跛着脚走了以后，侯生才匆忙地扒了几口饭又返回到门市后面。 \n　　他来到门市后面一看，金光明办公室的门锁了。锁了？他狐疑地想：是不是金光明把这女贼放了？ \n　　可能哩！光明也出身地主家庭，一个阶级的嘛！ \n　　侯生才不由自主地走到金光明门上，想在门缝里看一看人在不在里面。他还没弯下腰，就听见里面有哭声。在哩！就是的，他金光明岂敢把贼娃子放了！他不想端公家的饭碗子了？ \n　　侯生才这才又回到自己的办公室，洗了几个茶杯，等中学的领导人来处理这个行窃的女贼……这时候，侯玉英正领着孙少平往这里赶来了。 \n　　一路上，少平内心波涛汹涌。他没有想到，红梅在这即将离校的时候，给自己招致了如此严重的灾祸。他知道，这事一旦公开处理，红梅的一生就要被彻底毁灭了。他无法目睹活人的这种惨状。在他看来，一个人哪怕让汽车压得当场断气，也比背着个贼名活一辈子强。尤其对一个女人来说，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
