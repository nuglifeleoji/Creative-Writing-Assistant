Removing the barriers. When all else palled, there was still her tangled childhood.\nThere had been a time when Odrade lived as most children lived: in a house with a man and woman who, if not her parents, certainly acted in loco parentis. All of the other children she knew then lived in similar situations. They had\npapas and mamas. Sometimes only papa worked away from home. Sometimes only mama went out to her labors. In Odrade’s case, the woman remained at home and no crèche nurse guarded the child in the working hours. Much later, Odrade learned that her birth-mother had given a large sum of money to provide this for the infant female hidden in plain sight that way.\n“She hid you with us because she loved you,” the woman explained when Odrade was old enough to understand. “That is why you must never reveal that we are not your real parents.”\nLove had nothing to do with it, Odrade learned later. Reverend Mothers did not act from such mundane motives. And Odrade’s birth-mother had been a Bene Gesserit Sister.\nAll of this was revealed to Odrade according to the Original plan. Her name: Odrade. Darwi was what she had always been called when the caller was not being endearing or angry. Young friends naturally shortened it to Dar.\nEverything, however, did not go according to the original plan. Odrade recalled a narrow bed in a room brightened by paintings of animals and fantasy landscapes on the pastel blue walls. White curtains fluttered at the window in the soft breezes of spring and summer. Odrade remembered jumping on the narrow bed—a marvelously happy game: up, down, up, down. Much laughter. Arms caught her in mid leap and hugged her close. They were a man’s arms: a round face with a small mustache that tickled her into giggles. The bed thumped the wall when she jumped and the wall revealed indentations from this movement.\nOdrade played over this memory now, reluctant to discard it into the well of rationality. Marks on a wall. Marks of laughter and joy. How small they were to represent so much.\nOdd how she had been thinking more and more about papa recently. All of the memories were not happy. There had been times when he had been sad-angry, warning\nmama not to become “too involved.” He had a face that reflected many frustrations. His voice barked when he was in his angry mood. Mama moved softly then, her eyes full of worry. Odrade sensed the worry and the fear and resented the man. The woman knew best how to deal with him. She kissed the nape of his neck, stroked his cheek and whispered into his ear.\nThese ancient “natural” emotions had engaged a Bene Gesserit analyst-proctor in much work with Odrade before they were exorcised. But even now there was residual detritus to pick up and discard. Even now, Odrade knew that all of it was not gone.\nSeeing the way Taraza studied the biographical record with such care, Odrade wondered if that was the flaw the Mother Superior saw.\nSurely they know by now that I can deal with the emotions of those early times.\nIt was all so long ago. Still, she had to admit that the memory of the man and woman lay within her, bonded with such force that it might never be erased completely. Especially mama.\nThe Reverend Mother in extremis who had borne Odrade had put her in that hiding place on Gammu for reasons Odrade now understood quite well. Odrade harbored no resentments. It had been necessary for the survival of them both. Problems arose from the fact that the foster mother gave Odrade that thing which most mothers give their children, that thing which the Sisterhood so distrusted— love.\nWhen the Reverend Mothers came, the foster mother had not fought the removal of her child. Two Reverend Mothers came with a contingent of male and female proctors. Afterward Odrade was a long time understanding the significance of that wrenching moment. The woman had known in her heart that the day of parting would come. Only\na matter of time. Still, as the days became years—almost six standards of years—the woman had dared to hope.\nThen the Reverend Mothers came with their burly attendants. They had merely been waiting until it was safe, until they were sure no hunters knew this was a Bene Gesserit-planned Atreides scion.\nOdrade saw a great deal of money passed to the foster mother. The woman threw the money on the floor. But no voice was raised in objection. The adults in the scene knew where the power lay.\nCalling up those compressed emotions, Odrade could still see the woman take herself to a straight-backed chair beside the window onto the street, there to hug herself and rock back and forth, back and forth. Not a sound from her.\nThe Reverend Mothers used Voice and their considerable wiles plus the smoke of drugging herbs and their overpowering presence to lure Odrade into their waiting groundcar.\n“It will be just for a little while. Your real mother sent us.”\nOdrade sensed the lies but curiosity compelled. My real mother!\nHer last view of the woman who had been her only known female parent was of that figure at the window rocking back and forth, a look of misery on her face, arms wrapped around herself.\nLater, when Odrade spoke of returning to the woman, that memory-vision was incorporated into an essential Bene Gesserit lesson.\n“Love leads to misery. Love is a very ancient force, which served its purpose in its day but no longer is essential for the survival of the species. Remember that woman’s mistake, the pain.”\nUntil well into her teens, Odrade adjusted by daydreaming. She would rea//y return after she was a full Reverend Mother. She would go back and find that loving woman, find her even though she had no names except\n“mama” and “Sibia.” Odrade recalled the laughter of adult friends who had called the woman “Sibia.”\nMama Sibia.\nThe Sisters, however, detected the daydreams and searched out their source. That, too, was incorporated into a lesson.\n“Daydreaming is the first awakening of what we call simulflow. It is an essential tool of rational thought. With it you can clear the mind for better thinking.”\nSimulflow.\nOdrade focused on Taraza at the morning room table. Childhood trauma must be placed carefully into a reconstructed memory-place. All of that had been far away on Gammu, the planet that the people of Dan had rebuilt after the Famine Times and the Scattering. The people of Dan—Caladan in those days. Odrade took a firm grip on rational thought, using the stance of the Other Memories that had flooded into her awareness during the spice agony when she had really become a full Reverend Mother.\nSimulflow . . . the filter of consciousness ... Other Memories.\nWhat powerful tools the Sisterhood had given her. What dangerous tools. All of those other lives lay there just beyond the curtain of awareness, tools of survival, not a way to satisfy casual curiosity.\nTaraza spoke, translating from the material that scrolled past her eyes: “You dig too much in your Other Memories. That drains away energies better conserved.”\nThe Mother Superior’s blue-in-blue eyes sent a piercing stare upward at Odrade. “You sometimes go right to the edge of fleshly tolerance. That can lead to your premature death.”\n“lam careful with the spice, Mother.”\n“And well you should be! A body can take only so much melange, only so much prowling in its past!”\n“Have you found my flaw?” Odrade asked.\n“Gammu!” One word but an entire harangue.\nOdrade knew. The unavoidable trauma of those lost years on Gammu. They were a distraction that had to be rooted out and made rationally acceptable.\n“But | am sent to Rakis,” Odrade said.\n“And see that you remember the aphorisms of moderation. Remember who you are!”\nOnce more, Taraza bent to her display.\nlam Odrade, Odrade thought.\nIn the Bene Gesserit schools where first names tended to Slip away, roll call was by last name. Friends and acquaintances picked up the habit of using the roll-call name. They learned early that sharing secret or private names was an ancient device for ensnaring a person in affections.\nTaraza, three classes ahead of Odrade, had been assigned to “bring the younger girl along,” a deliberate association by watchful teachers.\n“Bringing along” meant a certain amount of lording it over the younger but also incorporated essentials better taught by someone closer to peer relationship. Taraza, with access to the private records of her trainee, started calling the younger girl “Dar.” Odrade responded by calling Taraza “Tar.” The two names acquired a certain glue—Dar and Tar. Even after Reverend Mothers overheard and reprimanded them, they occasionally lapsed into error if only for the amusement.\nOdrade, looking down at Taraza now, said: “Dar and Tar.”\nA smile twitched the edges of Taraza’s mouth.\n“What is it in my records that you don’t already know several times over?” Odrade asked.\nTaraza sat back and waited for the chairdog to adjust itself to the new position. She rested her clasped hands on the tabletop and looked up at the younger woman.\nNot much younger, really, Taraza thought.\nSince school, though, Taraza had thought of Odrade as completely removed into a younger age group, creating a gap no passage of years could close.\n“Care at the beginning, Dar,” Taraza said.\n“This project is well past its beginning,” Odrade said.\n“But your part in it starts now. And we are launching ourselves into such a beginning as has never before been attempted.”\n“Am | now to learn the entire design for this ghola?”\n“No.”\nThat was it. All the evidence of high-level dispute and the “need to know” cast away with a single word. But Odrade understood. There was an organizational rubric laid down by the original Bene Gesserit Chapter House, which had endured with only minor changes for millennia. Bene Gesserit divisions were cut by hard vertical and horizontal barriers, divided into isolated groups that converged to a single command only here at the top. Duties (for which read “assigned roles”) were conducted within separated cells. Active participants within a cell did not know their contemporaries within other parallel cells.\nBut I know that the Reverend Mother Lucilla is in a parallel cell, Odrade thought. /t’s the logical answer.\nShe recognized the necessity. It was an ancient design copied from secret revolutionary societies. The Bene Gesserit had always seen themselves as permanent revolutionaries. It was a revolution that had been dampened only in the time of the Tyrant, Leto Il.\nDampened, but not diverted or stopped, Odrade reminded herself.\n“In what you’re about to do,” Taraza said, “tell me if you sense any immediate threat to the Sisterhood.”\nIt was one of Taraza’s peculiar demands, which Odrade had learned to answer out of wordless instinct, which then could be formed into words. Quickly, she said: “If we fail to act, that is worse.”\n“We reasoned that there would be danger,” Taraza said. She spoke in a dry, remote voice. Taraza did not like calling up this talent in Odrade. The younger woman possessed a prescient instinct for detecting threats to the Sisterhood. It came from the wild influence in her genetic line, of course— the Atreides with their dangerous talents. There was a special mark", " had always seen themselves as permanent revolutionaries. It was a revolution that had been dampened only in the time of the Tyrant, Leto Il.\nDampened, but not diverted or stopped, Odrade reminded herself.\n“In what you’re about to do,” Taraza said, “tell me if you sense any immediate threat to the Sisterhood.”\nIt was one of Taraza’s peculiar demands, which Odrade had learned to answer out of wordless instinct, which then could be formed into words.

The younger woman possessed a prescient instinct for detecting threats to the Sisterhood. It came from the wild influence in her genetic line, of course— the Atreides with their dangerous talents. There was a special mark on Odrade’s breeding file: “Careful examination of all offspring.” Two of those offspring had been quietly put to death.\n| should not have awakened Odrade’s talent now, not even for a moment, Taraza thought. But sometimes temptation was very great.\nTaraza sealed the projector into her tabletop and looked at the blank surface while speaking. “Even if you find a perfect sire, you are not to breed without our permission while you are away from us.”\n“The mistake of my natural mother,” Odrade said.\n“The mistake of your natural mother was to be recognized while she was breeding!”\nOdrade had heard this before. There was that thing about the Atreides line that required the most careful monitoring by the breeding mistresses. The wild talent, of course. She knew about the wild talent, that genetic force which had produced the Kwisatz Haderach and the Tyrant. What did the breeding mistresses seek now, though? Was their approach mostly negative? No more dangerous births! She had never seen any of her babies after they were born, not necessarily a curious thing for the Sisterhood. And she never saw any of the records in her own genetic file. Here, too, the Sisterhood operated with careful separation of powers.\nAnd those earlier prohibitions on my Other Memories!\nShe had found the blank spaces in her memories and opened them. It was probable that only Taraza and perhaps two other councillors (Bellonda, most likely, and one other\nolder Reverend Mother) shared the more sensitive access to such breeding information.\nHad Taraza and the other really sworn to die before revealing privileged information to an outsider? There was, after all, a precise ritual of succession should a key Reverend Mother die while away from her Sisters and with no chance to pass along her encapsulated lives. The ritual had been called into play many times during the reign of the Tyrant. A terrible period! Knowing that the revolutionary cells of the Sisterhood were transparent to him! Monster! She knew that her sisters had never deluded themselves that Leto Il refrained from destroying the Bene Gesserit out of some deep-seated loyalty to his grandmother, the Lady Jessica.\nAre you there, Jessica?\nOdrade felt the stirring far within. The failure of one Reverend Mother: “She allowed herself to fall in love!” Such a small thing but how great the consequences. Thirty-five hundred years of tyranny!\nThe Golden Path. Infinite? What of the lost megatrillions gone into the Scattering? What threat was posed by those Lost Ones returning now?\nAs though she read Odrade’s mind, which sometimes she appeared to do, Taraza said: “The Scattered ones are out there ... just waiting to pounce.”\nOdrade had heard the arguments: Danger on the one hand and on the other, something magnetically attractive. So many magnificent unknowns. The Sisterhood with its talents honed by melange over the millennia—what might they not do with such untapped resources of humanity? Think of the uncounted genes out there! Think of the potential talents floating free in universes where they might be lost forever!\n“It’s the not knowing that conjures up the greatest terrors,” Odrade said.\n“And the greatest ambitions,” Taraza said.\n“Then do | go to Rakis?”\n“In due course. | find you adequate to the task.”\n“Or you would not have assigned me.”\nIt was an old exchange between them, going right back to their school days. Taraza realized, though, that she had not entered it consciously. Too many memories tangled the two of them: Dar and Tar. Have to watch that!\n“Remember where your loyalties are,” Taraza said.\nThe existence of no-ships raises the possibility of destroying entire planets without retaliation. A large object, asteroid or equivalent, may be sent against the planet. Or the people can be set against each other by sexual subversion, and then can be armed to destroy themselves. These Honored Matres appear to favor this latter technique.\n—BENE GESSERIT ANALYSIS\nF rom his position in the courtyard and even when not appearing to do so, Duncan Idaho kept his attention on the observers above him. There was Patrin, of course, but Patrin did not count. It was the Reverend Mothers across from Patrin who bore watching. Seeing Lucilla, he thought: That’s the new one. This thought filled him with a surge of excitement, which he took out in renewed exercise.\nHe completed the first three patterns of the training-play Miles Teg had ordered, vaguely aware that Patrin would report on how well he did. Duncan liked Teg and old Patrin and sensed that the feeling was reciprocated. This new Reverend Mother, though—her presence suggested interesting changes. For one thing, she was younger than the others. Also, this new one did not try to hide the eyes that were a first clue to her membership in the Bene Gesserit. His first glimpse of Schwangyu had confronted him with eyes concealed behind contact lenses that simulated non-addict pupils and slightly bloodshot whites. He had heard one of the Keep’s acolytes say Schwangyu’s lenses also corrected for “an astigmatic weakness that has been accepted in her genetic line as a reasonable exchange for the other qualities she transmits to her offspring.”\nAt the time, most of this remark was unintelligible to Duncan but he had looked up the references in the Keep’s\nlibrary, references both scarce and severely limited in content. Schwangyu herself parried all of his questions on the subject, but the subsequent behavior of his teachers told him she had been angry. Typically, she had taken out her anger on others.\nWhat really upset her, he suspected, was his demand to know whether she was his mother.\nFor a long time now Duncan had known he was something special. There were places in the elaborate compound of this Bene Gesserit Keep where he was not permitted. He had found private ways to evade such prohibitions and had stared out often through thick plaz and open windows at guards and wide reaches of cleared ground that could be enfiladed from strategically positioned pillboxes. Miles Teg himself had taught the significance of enfilade positioning.\nGammu, the planet was called now. Once, it had been known as Giedi Prime but someone named Gurney Halleck had changed that. It was all ancient history. Dull stuff. There still remained a faint smell of bitter oil in the planet’s dirt from its pre-Danian days. Millennia of special plantations were changing that, his teachers explained. He could see part of this from the Keep. Forests of conifers and other trees surrounded them here.\nStill covertly watching the two Reverend Mothers, Duncan did a series of cartwheels. He flexed his striking muscles as he moved, just the way Teg had taught him.\nTeg also instructed in planetary defenses. Gammu was ringed by orbiting monitors whose crews could not have their families aboard. The families remained down here on Gammu, hostage to the vigilance of those guardian orbiters. Somewhere among the ships in space, there were undetectable no-ships whose crews were composed entirely of the Bashar’s people and Bene Gesserit Sisters.\n“I would not have taken this assignment without full charge of all defensive arrangements,” Teg explained.\nDuncan realized that he was “this assignment.” The Keep was here to protect him. Teg’s orbiting monitors, including the no-ships, protected the Keep.\nIt was all part of a military education whose elements Duncan found somehow familiar. Learning how to defend a seemingly vulnerable planet from attacks originating in Space, he knew when those defenses were correctly placed. It was extremely complicated as a whole but the elements were identifiable and could be understood. There was, for instance, the constant monitoring of atmosphere and the blood serum of Gammu’s inhabitants. Suk doctors in the pay of the Bene Gesserit were everywhere.\n“Diseases are weapons,” Teg said. “Our defense against diseases must be finely tuned.”\nFrequently, Teg railed against passive defenses. He called them “the product of a siege mentality long known to create deadly weaknesses.”\nWhen it came to military instructions from Teg, Duncan listened carefully. Patrin and the library records confirmed that the Mentat Bashar Miles Teg had been a famous military leader for the Bene Gesserit. Patrin often referred to their service together and always Teg was the hero.\n“Mobility is the key to military success,” Teg said. “If you're tied down in forts, even whole-planet forts, you are ultimately vulnerable.”\nTeg did not much care for Gammu.\n“I see that you already know this place was called Giedi Prime once. The Harkonnens who ruled here taught us a few things. We have a better idea, thanks to them, of how terrifyingly brutal humans can become.”\nAs he recalled this, Duncan observed that the two Reverend Mothers watching from the parapet obviously were discussing him.\nAm I the new one’s assignment?\nDuncan did not like being watched and he hoped the new one would allow him some time to himself. She did not look\nlike a tough one. Not like Schwangyu.\nAs he continued his exercises, Duncan timed them to a private litany: Damn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!\nHe had hated Schwangyu from the age of nine—four years now. She did not know his hate, he thought. She had probably forgotten all about the incident where his hate had been ignited.\nBarely nine and he had managed to slip through the inner guards out into a tunnel that led to one of the pillboxes. Smell of fungus in the tunnel. Dim lights. Dampness. He peered out through the box’s weapons slits before being caught and hustled back into the core of the Keep.\nThis escapade occasioned a stern lecture from Schwangyu, a remote and threatening figure whose orders must be obeyed. That was how he still thought of her, although he had since learned about the Bene Gesserit Voice-of-Command, that vocal subtlety which could bend the will of an untrained listener.\nShe must be obeyed.\n“You have occasioned the disciplining of an entire guard unit,” Schwangyu said. “They will be severely punished.”\nThat had been the most terrible part of her lecture. Duncan liked some of the guards and occasionally lured some of them into real play with laughter and tumbling. His prank, sneaking out to the pillbox, had hurt his friends.\nDuncan knew what it was to be punished.\nDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\nAfter Schwangyu’s lecture, Duncan ran to his chief instructor of the moment, Reverend Mother Tamalane, another of the wizened old ones with a cool and aloof manner, snowy hair above a narrow face and a leather skin. He demanded of Tamalane to know about the punishment of his guards. Tamalane fell into a surprising pensive mood, her voice like", "-Command, that vocal subtlety which could bend the will of an untrained listener.\nShe must be obeyed.\n“You have occasioned the disciplining of an entire guard unit,” Schwangyu said. “They will be severely punished.”\nThat had been the most terrible part of her lecture. Duncan liked some of the guards and occasionally lured some of them into real play with laughter and tumbling. His prank, sneaking out to the pillbox, had hurt his friends.\nDuncan knew what it was to be punished.\nDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\nAfter Schwangyu’s lecture, Duncan ran to his chief instructor of the moment, Reverend Mother Tamalane, another of the wizened old ones with a cool and aloof manner, snowy hair above a narrow face and a leather skin. He demanded of Tamalane to know about the punishment of his guards. Tamalane fell into a surprising pensive mood, her voice like sand rasping against wood.”\n“Punishments? Well, well.”\nThey were in the small teaching room off the larger practice floor where Tamalane went each evening to prepare the next day’s lessons. It was a place of bubble and spool readers and other sophisticated means for information storage and retrieval. Duncan far preferred it to the library but he was not allowed in the teaching room unattended. It was a bright room lighted by many suspensor-buoyed glowglobes. At his intrusion, Tamalane turned away from where she laid out his lessons.\n“There’s always something of a sacrificial banquet about our major punishments,” she said. “The guards will, of course, receive major punishment.”\n“Banquet?” Duncan was puzzled.\nTamalane swung completely around in her swivel seat and looked directly into his eyes. Her steely teeth glittered in the bright lights. “History has seldom been good to those who must be punished,” she said.\nDuncan flinched at the word “history.” It was one of Tamalane’s signals. She was going to teach a lesson, another boring lesson.\n“Bene Gesserit punishments cannot be forgotten.”\nDuncan focused on Tamalane’s old mouth, sensing abruptly that she spoke out of painful personal experience. He was going to learn something interesting!\n“Our punishments carry an inescapable lesson,” Tamalane said. “It is much more than the pain.”\nDuncan sat on the floor at her feet. From this angle, Tamalane was a black-shrouded and ominous figure.\n“We do not punish with the ultimate agony,” she said. “That is reserved for a Reverend Mother’s passage through the spice.”\nDuncan nodded. Library records referred to “spice agony,” a mysterious trial that created a Reverend Mother.\n“Major punishments are painful, nonetheless,” she said. “They are also emotionally painful. Emotion evoked by punishment is always that emotion we judge to be the\npenitent’s greatest weakness, and thus we strengthen the punished.”\nHer words filled Duncan with unfocused dread. What were they doing to his guards? He could not speak but there was no need. Tamalane was not finished.\n“The punishment always ends with a dessert,” she said and she clapped her hands against her knees.\nDuncan frowned. Dessert? That was part of a banquet. How could a banquet be punishment?\n“It is not really a banquet but the idea of a banquet,” Tamalane said. One clawlike hand described a circle in the air. “The dessert comes, something totally unexpected. The penitent thinks: Ahhh, | have been forgiven at last! You understand?”\nDuncan shook his head from side to side. No, he did not understand.\n“It is the sweetness of the moment,” she said. “You have been through every course of a painful banquet and come out at the end to something you can savor. But! As you savor it, then comes the most painful moment of all, the recognition, the understanding that this is not pleasure-at- the-end. No, indeed. This is the ultimate pain of the major punishment. It locks in the Bene Gesserit lesson.”\n“But what will she do to those guards?” The words were wrenched from Duncan.\n“I cannot say what the specific elements of the individual punishments will be. | have no need to know. | can only tell you it will be different for each of them.”\nTamalane would say no more. She returned to laying out the next day’s lessons. “We will continue tomorrow,” she said, “teaching you to identify the sources of the various accents of spoken Galach.”\nNo one else, not even Teg or Patrin, would answer his questions about the punishments. Even the guards, when he saw them afterward, refused to speak of their ordeals. Some reacted curtly to his overtures and none would play with\nhim anymore. There was no forgiveness among the punished. That much was clear.\nDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\nThat was where his deep hatred of her began. All of the old witches shared in his hatred. Would the new young one be the same as the old ones?\nDamn Schwangyu!\nWhen he demanded of Schwangyu: “Why did you have to punish them?” Schwangyu took some time before answering, then: “It is dangerous for you here on Gammu. There are people who wish you harm.”\nDuncan did not ask why. This was another area where his questions were never answered. Not even Teg would answer, although Teg’s very presence emphasized the fact of that danger.\nAnd Miles Teg was a Mentat who must know many answers. Duncan often saw the old man’s eyes glisten while his thoughts went far away. But there was no Mentat response to such questions as:\n“Why are we here on Gammu?”\n“Who do you guard against? Who wants to harm me?”\n“Who are my parents?”\nSilence greeted such questions or sometimes Teg would growl: “I cannot answer you.”\nThe library was useless. He had discovered this when he was only eight and his chief instructor was a failed Reverend Mother named Luran Geasa—not quite as ancient as Schwangyu but well along in years, more than a hundred, anyway.\nAt his demand, the library produced information about Gammu/Giedi Prime, about the Harkonnens and their fall, about various conflicts where Teg had commanded. None of those battles came through as very bloody; several commentators referred to Teg’s “Superb diplomacy.” But, one datum leading to another, Duncan learned about the time of the God Emperor and the taming of his people. This\nperiod commanded Duncan’s attention for weeks. He found an old map in the records and projected it on the focus wall. The commentator’s superimpositions told him that this very Keep had been a Fish Speaker Command Center abandoned during the Scattering.\nFish Speakers!\nDuncan wished then that he had lived during their time, serving as one of the rare male advisors in the female army that had worshiped the great God Emperor.\nOh, to have lived on Rakis in those days!\nTeg was surprisingly forthcoming about the God Emperor, calling him always “the Tyrant.” A library lock was opened and information about Rakis came pouring out for Duncan.\n“Will | ever see Rakis?” he asked Geasa.\n“You are being prepared to live there.”\nThe answer astonished him. Everything they taught him about that faraway planet came into new focus.\n“Why will | live there?”\n“I cannot answer that.”\nWith renewed interest, he returned to his studies of that mysterious planet and its miserable Church of Shai-hulud, the Divided God. Worms. The God Emperor had become those worms! The idea filled Duncan with awe. Perhaps here was something worthy of worship. The thought touched a chord in him. What had driven a man to accept that terrible metamorphosis?\nDuncan knew what his guards and the others in the Keep thought about Rakis and the core of priesthood there. Sneering remarks and laughter told it all. Teg said: “We'll probably never know the whole truth of it, but | tell you, lad, that’s no religion for a soldier.”\nSchwangyu capped it: “You are to learn about the Tyrant but you are not to believe in his religion. That is beneath you, contemptible.”\nIn every spare study moment, Duncan pored over whatever the library produced for him: the Holy Book of the\nDivided God, the Guard Bible, the Orange Catholic Bible and even the Apocrypha. He learned about the long defunct Bureau of the Faith and “The Pearl that IS the Sun of Understanding.”\nThe very idea of the worms fascinated him. Their size! A big one would stretch from one end of the Keep to the other. Men had ridden the pre-Tyrant worms but the Rakian priesthood forbade this now.\nHe found himself gripped by accounts from the archeological team that had found the Tyrant’s primitive no- chamber on Rakis. Dar-es-Balat, the place was called. The reports by Archeologist Hadi Benotto were marked “Suppressed by orders of the Rakian Priesthood.” The file number on the accounts from Bene Gesserit Archives was a long one and what Benotto revealed was fascinating.\n“A kernel of the God Emperor’s awareness in each worm?” he asked Geasa.\n“So it’s said. And even if true, they are not conscious, not aware. The Tyrant himself said he would enter an endless dream.”\nEach study session occasioned a special lecture and Bene Gesserit explanations of religion until finally he encountered those accounts called “The Nine Daughters of Siona” and “The Thousand Sons of Idaho.”\nConfronting Geasa, he demanded: “My name is Duncan Idaho, too. What does that mean?”\nGeasa always moved as though standing in the shadow of her failure, her long head bent forward and her watery eyes aimed at the ground. The confrontation occurred near evening in the long hall outside the practice floor. She paled at his question.\nWhen she did not answer, he demanded: “Am | descended from Duncan Idaho?”\n“You must ask Schwangyu.” Geasa sounded as though the words pained her.\nIt was a familiar response and it angered him. She meant he would be told something to shut him up, little information in the telling. Schwangyu, however, was more open than expected.\n“You carry the authentic blood of Duncan Idaho.”\n“Who are my parents?”\n“They are long dead.”\n“How did they die?”\n“I do not know. We received you as an orphan.”\n“Then why do people want to harm me?”\n“They fear what you may do.”\n“What is it | may do?”\n“Study your lessons. All will be made clear to you in time.”\nShut up and study! Another familiar answer.\nHe obeyed because he had learned to recognize when the doors were closed on him. But now his questing intelligence met other accounts of the Famine Times and the Scattering, the no-chambers and no-ships that could not be traced, not even by the most powerful prescient minds in their universe. Here, he encountered the fact that descendants of Duncan Idaho and Siona, those ancients who had served the Tyrant God Emperor, also were invisible to prophets and prescients. Not even a Guild Steersman deep in melange trance could detect such people. Siona, the accounts told him, was a true-bred Atreides and Duncan Idaho was a ghola.\nGhola?\nHe probed the library for elaborations on this peculiar word. Ghola. The library produced for him no more than bare-boned accounts: “Gholas: humans grown from a cadaver’s cells in Tleilaxu axlotl tanks.”\nAxlotl tanks?\n“A Tleilaxu device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver.”\n“Describe a"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_afe445569c0ede705c67ac468ad0da6fb04c5ba5a9eaf9ea55804d436b56ebaf_v2"}
