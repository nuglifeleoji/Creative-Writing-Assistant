上重新演绎的中国现代史，讲述一个文明二百次毁灭与重生的传奇。\n　　朋友们将会看到，连载的这第一期，几乎不是科幻，但这本书并不是这一期显示出来的这个样子，它不是现实科幻，比《球状闪电》更空灵，希望您能耐心地看下去，后面的故事变化会很大。\n　　在以后的一段时光中，读者朋友们将走过我在过去的一年中走过的精神历程，坦率地说，我不知道你们将在这条黑暗诡异的迷途上看到什么，我很不安。但科幻写到今天，能够与大家同行这么长一段，也是缘份。\n后记\n     如果存在外星文明，那么宇宙中有共同的道德准则吗？往小处说，这是科幻迷很感兴趣的一个问题；往大处说，它可能关乎人类文明的生死存亡。\n     二十世纪八十年代的国内科幻作家们是倾向于肯定的回答的，那时的科幻小说中，外星人都以慈眉善目的形象出现，以天父般的仁慈和宽容，指引着人类这群迷途的羔羊，金涛的《月光岛》中，外星人抚慰着人类受伤的心灵；童恩正《遥远的爱》中人类与外星人的爱情凄美而壮丽；郑文光的《地球镜像》中，人类道德的低下，甚至把技术水平高出几个数量级但却怀有菩萨心肠的外星文明吓跑了！\n \n     但是，“人之初，性本善”之说在人类世界都很可疑，放之宇宙更不可能皆准。\n     要回答宇宙道德的问题，只有通过科学的理性思维才能让人信服。这里我们能很自然地想到，可以通过人类世界各种不同文明的演化史来对宇宙大文明系统进行类比，但前者的研究也是十分困难的，有太多的无法定量的因素纠结在一起。相比之下，对宇宙间各文明关系的研究却有可能更定量更数学化一些，因为星际间遥远的距离使各个文明点状化了，就像在体育场的最后一排看足球，球员本身的复杂技术动作已经被距离隐去，球场上出现的只是由二十三个点构成的不断变化的矩阵（有一个特殊的点是球，球类运动中只有足球赛呈现出如此清晰的数学结构，这也可能是这门运动的魅力之一）。我曾经陷入宇宙文明点状化的这种思维游戏中不可自拔，上世纪九十年代初，为打发时间，我常常编些无聊但自觉有趣的软件，现在网上重新流行的电子诗人就是那时的产物。那个时期，我还编过一个宇宙点状文明体系总体状态的模拟软件，将宇宙间的智慧文明简化为点，每个点只具有描述该文明基本特征的十几个简单参数，然后将文明的数量设置得十分巨大，在软件中模拟这个体系的整体演化过程。为此我请教了一位可敬的学者，他是研究电网理论的，是建立教学模型的高手，算不上科幻迷但也是爱好者，他对我那个错误百出的模型进行了修正。软件运行时最多的一次\n######################\nOutput:",
