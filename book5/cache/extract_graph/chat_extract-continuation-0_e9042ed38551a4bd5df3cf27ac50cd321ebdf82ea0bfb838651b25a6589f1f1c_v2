“这事真的发生了，是吗?”\n　　丁仪将手中的两杯酒都仰头灌下去，两眼直勾勾地看着台球桌，仿佛那是个魔鬼，“是的，发生了。近年来，基础理论研究的实验验证条件渐渐成熟，有三个昂贵的‘台球桌’被造了出来，一个在北美，一个在欧洲，还有一个你当然知道，在中国良湘，你们纳米中心从那里赚了不少钱。\n　　“这些高能加速器将实验中粒子对撞的能量提高了一个数量级，这是人类以前从未达到过的。在新的对撞能级下，同样的粒子，同样的撞击能量，一切试验条件都相同，结果却不一样。不但在不同的加速度上不一样，在同一加速器不同时间的试验中也不一样，物理学家们慌了，把这种相同条件的超高能撞击试验一次次地重复，但每次的结果都不同，也没有规律。”\n　　“这意味着什么呢?”汪淼问，看到丁仪盯着自己不做声，他又补充道，“哦，我搞纳米，也接触物质微观结构，但比起你们来要浅好几个层次，请指教一下。”\n　　“这意味着物理规律在时间和空间上不均匀。”\n　　“这又意味着什么呢?”\n　　“往下您应该能推论出来吧，那个将军都想出来了，他真是个聪明人。”\n　　汪淼看着窗外沉思着，外面城市的灯海一片灿烂，夜空中的星星被淹没得看不见了。\n　　“这就意味着宇宙普适的物理规律不存在，那物理学……也不存在了。”汪淼从窗外收回目光说。\n　　“‘我知道自己这样做是不负责任的，但别无选择。’”丁仪紧接着说，“这是她遗书的后半部分，您无意中刚说出了前半部分，现在多少能够理解她吧。”\n　　汪淼从台球桌上拿起刚才他打过五次的那个白球，抚摸了一会儿轻轻放下， “这对一个前沿理论的探索者确实是个灾难。”\n　　“在理论物理这个领域要想有所建树，需要一种宗教般的执著，这很容易把人引向深渊。”\n　　告辞时，丁仪给了汪淼一个地址。\n　　“你如果有空，拜托去看看杨冬的母亲。杨冬一直和她住在一起，女儿是她生活的全部，现在就一个人了，很可怜。”\n　　汪淼说：“丁仪，你知道得显然比我多，就不能再透露一点吗?你真的相信物理规律在时空上不均匀?”\n　　“我什么都不知道……”\n　　丁仪与汪淼对视了好长时间，最后说： “这是个问题。”\n　　汗淼知道，他不过是接下了那位英军上校的话：生存还是死亡，这是个问题。\n6．射手和农场主\n　　第二天是周末，汪淼反而起得很早，带上相机骑着自行车出去了。作为一名摄影爱好者，他最向往的题材是人迹罕至的荒野，但人到中年，已经没有精力进行这种奢侈的享受了，大多数时间只能在城市里拍风景了。他有意无意地选取城\n######################\nOutput:",
