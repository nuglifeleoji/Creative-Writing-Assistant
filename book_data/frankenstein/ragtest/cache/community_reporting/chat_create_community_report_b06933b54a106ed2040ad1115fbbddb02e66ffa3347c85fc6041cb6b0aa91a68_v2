She worked part-time jobs, including at **菊屋**, and took on home-based piecework to make ends meet. Her life was marked by hardship, and she was described as having a gloomy demeanor.  \n\n西本文代 became entangled in the investigation surrounding the murder of **桐原洋介**, a pawnshop owner. She was interrogated by the police due to her connection with the case, particularly after a **登喜路 (Dunhill) lighter** linked to the crime was found in **寺崎忠夫's** truck. Though she was considered a suspect, she had a nearly **perfect alibi**, having been seen at **丸金屋超市** and a **park** on the day of the murder. There were suspicions that she may have had a male accomplice, but no conclusive evidence was found.  \n\nHer death occurred when **雪穗** was in the sixth grade. She was discovered deceased in her home due to **gas poisoning**, which was initially ruled as a possible **suicide or accident**. However, detective **笹垣** harbored suspicions that her death might not have been natural and could have been connected to **雪穗**, renewing his scrutiny of the case.  \n\n西本文代's relationship with **桐原洋介** involved **financial transactions**, though the exact nature remains unclear. Her demise further complicated the unresolved mysteries surrounding both her own death and the **桐原洋介 murder case**, leaving lingering questions about potential foul play and her daughter's involvement.\",22\n93,寺崎忠夫,\"**寺崎忠夫** was a suspect in a murder case that ultimately went cold following his death in a car accident. He died when his truck, which was carrying soap and cleaning supplies, crashed on the **阪神高速公路大阪守口线 (Hanshin Expressway Osaka Moriguchi Line)**.\n\nHe was the operator of **扬羽商事 (Ageha Shōji)** and had a romantic relationship with **西本文代 (Nishimoto Fumiyo)**. Additionally, there were allegations that he may have engaged in pedophilic behavior, though these claims remain unresolved due to his untimely death. \n\nThe combination of his suspicious involvement in the murder case, his relationship with Nishimoto Fumiyo, and the unresolved allegations contributed to the lingering mystery surrounding his actions and the unresolved criminal investigation. His death prevented further legal proceedings, leaving many questions unanswered.\",5\n63,菊屋,\"**菊屋** is a well-known udon (乌龙面) restaurant located in the Imazato (今里) area. Described as a clean and refreshing establishment, it is known for its bustling business and popularity among customers. The restaurant is also notable as the workplace of **Nishimoto Fumiyo (西本文代)**, further adding to its recognition in the local community. Combining all descriptions, 菊屋 is a thriving udon eatery with a tidy and inviting atmosphere, serving as both a culinary destination and a key setting in the narrative involving Nishimoto Fumiyo.  \n\n(Word count: 90)\",3\n80,乌龙面店,\"**乌龙面店（菊屋）**  \n\n乌龙面店名为“菊屋”，是一家经营乌龙面的餐饮店。西本文代曾在此工作，该店是她生前的工作地点。菊屋的经济状况不佳，可能面临经营困难或财务压力。西本文代与这家店的关系较为紧密，她的就业经历和经济环境都与菊屋的状况相关联。  \n\n综合来看，菊屋作为一家乌龙面店，不仅是西本文代的职场，也反映了她生前所处的经济困境。尽管描述中没有更多细节，但可以推断该店在西本文代的生活中扮演了重要角色。\",2\n111,西本秀夫,\"西本秀夫 was the deceased husband of 西本文代 and father of 西本雪穗, who previously lived in 吉田公寓\",2\n52,吉田公寓,\"**吉田公寓** is a thirty-year-old, poorly maintained apartment building where **西本文代 (Fumiyo Nishimoto)** and her daughter **西本雪穗 (Yukiho Nishimoto, later known as Karasawa Yukiho)** once lived. The apartment, specifically unit 103, was the site of a tragic gas poisoning incident that resulted in 西本文代's death.  \n\nThe building is described as old and dilapidated, primarily housing elderly residents in later years. It served as the residence for 西本雪穗 during her childhood before she moved out and eventually took on the surname **唐泽 (Karasawa)**. The gas poisoning event at 吉田公寓 is a significant incident tied to the lives of both 西本文代 and 西本雪穗.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its current state as a rundown building mostly occupied by older residents, others focus on its historical role in the lives of the Nishimoto family. There are no major contradictions in the descriptions, only varying emphases on different aspects—its condition, its residents, and the pivotal event that occurred there.  \n\nIn summary, **吉田公寓** is an aging, poorly maintained apartment complex known for being the former home of 西本文代 and 西本雪穗, as well as the site of 西本文代's fatal gas poisoning.
