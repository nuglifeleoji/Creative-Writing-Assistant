\n　　一道土塄坎挡住了去路。少平敏捷地一扑就跳上去了。晓霞立在塄坎下，笑着摇了摇头；然后向他伸出一只手，要让他拉她。少平顿时有点慌乱，脸红得象水萝卜一样。晓霞被他的窘态逗得大笑，手却固执地伸着，非让他拉不行。 \n　　少平只好伸出一只颤抖的手，把她拉上了土塄坎。这是他第一次拉一个姑娘的手。他感到自己的那条胳膊僵硬得象条棍子；手掌如同被烧红的铁烫过一般。 \n　　到山顶了。两个人在一个斜坡上坐下来。 \n　　黄原城就在他们眼皮底下。街道上熙熙攘攘的行人象忙碌的蚁群。他们的背后，太阳正在沉落。对面的九级古塔在夕阳中闪耀着光辉，看起来似乎象发射架上的一枚巨型火箭，格外雄伟。初春蓝色的黄原河将城市分割成两半后，弯弯曲曲地流向远方的群山深谷之中……两个人先顾不上说话，惊奇而兴奋地观赏夕阳晚照中的大自然景象。 \n　　城市渐渐沉浸在阴暗中，景物开始模糊起来。黄原河上新老两座大桥首先亮起了灯火；紧接着，全城的灯火一批跟着一批亮了。 \n　　这时候，晓霞才转过脸，问少平看过《白轮船》后，有什么感想。 \n　　少平断断续续，结结巴巴说了一些，好象也没能把自己的感受充分表达出来。 \n　　说实话吧，这会儿他思想不能集中起来！是呀，黄昏中，在一个荒山野地里，单独和一个姑娘呆在一块，使他浑身的血液由不得沸沸扬扬……内心的骚动让他坐立不安，他索性仰面躺在一片枯草上，两只手垫在脑后，茫然地望着暮色中的天空。天空已经亮出几颗星星。 \n　　晓霞也就不再出声，静静地坐在离他不远的地方，两只手抱着膝头，凝望着远方的山峦。这是一个美妙的时光。小树林中，归窠的鸟雀扇动着扑棱棱的羽翅。没有风，空气中流布着微微的温暖。春天的黄昏呀，使人产生无尽的遐思和深远的联想，也常常叫人感到一种无以名状的忧伤！躺在地上的孙少平，不知为什么突然眼里涌满了泪水。他深深地向夜空中吐出一声叹息，嘴里竟然喃喃地念起了《白轮船》中吉尔吉斯人的那首古歌——有没有比你更宽阔的河流，爱耐塞，有没有比你更亲切的土地，爱耐塞，有没有比你更深重的苦难，爱耐塞，有没有比你更自由的意志，爱耐塞，晓霞仍然保持着她那雕像\n######################\nOutput:",
