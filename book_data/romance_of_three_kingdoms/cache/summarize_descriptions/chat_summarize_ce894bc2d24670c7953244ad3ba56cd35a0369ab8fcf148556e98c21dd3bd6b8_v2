Zhang Jiao gained a substantial following by claiming to possess healing abilities, particularly during a devastating plague that affected the population. His reputation as a healer contributed to his influence and the growth of his movement.\n\nIn addition to his healing claims, Zhang Jiao was noted for his use of sorcery and military tactics, which he employed to rally his followers and challenge the authority of the Han dynasty. The Yellow Turban Rebellion, which he led, was characterized by its grassroots nature, drawing support from various social classes discontented with the ruling regime. The rebellion was marked by its distinctive yellow headbands worn by the insurgents, symbolizing their cause and unity.\n\nZhang Jiao's leadership and the ideologies he espoused were rooted in a blend of religious and political motivations, aiming to address the widespread suffering and corruption prevalent in society at the time. His movement not only sought to overthrow the Han dynasty but also aimed to establish a new order based on his teachings and beliefs.\n\nOverall, Zhang Jiao's legacy is intertwined with the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which played a crucial role in the decline of the Han dynasty and set the stage for subsequent power struggles in China.
