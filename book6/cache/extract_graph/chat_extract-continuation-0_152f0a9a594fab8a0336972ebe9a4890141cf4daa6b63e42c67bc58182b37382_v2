海军的作战模式和理论与太空战争最接近。”\n　　“这是对的。”父亲又点点头。\n　　“那我该怎么办？”\n　　爸，我终于问出这句话了，这句我整夜未眠才最后下决心问出来的话，刚才见到您时我又犹豫了，我知道这是最让您失望的一句话。记得研究生毕业后，我作为一名上尉见习官进入舰队时，您说：“北海啊，你还差得远，这么说是因为我现在还能轻易地理解你。能让我理解，说明你的思想还简单，还不够深，等到我看不透搞不懂你，而你能轻易理解我的那一天，你才算真正长大了了。”后来，我照您说的长大了您再也不可能那样轻易地理解自己的儿子了，说您丝毫没有对此感到悲哀我不信，但儿子确实正在成为您能寄以希望的那种人，那种虽不可爱，但在海军这个复杂艰险的领域有可能成功的人。现在，儿子问出了这句话，无疑标志着您对我这三十多年的培育，在最关键的时候失败了。可是爸，您还是告诉我吧，儿子还没有您想的那样强大，反正就这一次了，求求您告诉我吧。\n　　“要多想。”父亲说。\n　　好的。爸，您已经回答了我，说了很多很多的话，真的很多，这三个字的内容用三万字都说不完，请相信儿子，我用自己的心听到了这些话，但求您再说清楚一些吧，因为这太重要了。\n　　“想了以后呢？”章北海问，他的双手紧紧攥着床单，手心和额头都潮湿了。\n　　爸，原谅我，如果说前次发问让您失望，那这一次我变回孩子了。\n　　“北海，我只能告诉你那以前要多想。”父亲回答。\n　　爸，谢谢您。您说得很清楚了，我的心都听懂了。\n　　章北海松开攥着床单的手，握住父亲一只瘦削的手说：“爸，以后不出海了，我会常来看您。”\n　　父亲微笑着摇摇头，“我这儿没什么了，忙工作去吧。”\n　　他们又谈了一会儿，先是说了些家里的事，后来又谈到太空军的建设，父亲说了自己的很多想法，以及对章北海以后工作的建议。他们共同想象未来太空战舰的外形和体积，兴趣盎然地讨论太空战的武器，甚至还谈到了马汉的制海权理论是否适用于太空战场但他们之间的这些话语已经没有太多意义，只不过是章北海陪着父亲用语言散步而已，真正有意义的，是父子间心对心交流的那三句：“要多想。”\n　　“想了以后呢？”\n　　“北海，我只能告诉你那以前要多想。”\n　　章北海告别父亲后走出病房，透过门上的小窗又凝视了父亲一会儿。这时，夕阳的光缕已离开了父亲，把他遗弃在一片朦胧中，但他的目光穿透这朦胧，看着投在对面墙上的最后一小片余晖。虽然即将消逝\n######################\nOutput:",
