�诞入帐，赐以印绶，加为镇东大将军，都督扬州诸路军马；一面班师回许昌。师目痛不止，每夜只见李丰、张缉、夏侯玄三人立于榻前。师心神恍惚，自料难保，遂令人往洛阳取司马昭到。昭哭拜于床下。师遗言曰：“吾今权重，虽欲卸肩，不可得也。汝继我为之，大事切不可轻托他人，自取灭族之祸。”言讫，以印绶付之，泪流满面。昭急欲问时，师大叫一声，眼睛迸出而死。时正元二年二月也。于是司马昭发丧，申奏魏主曹髦。\n\n    髦遣使持诏到许昌，即命暂留司马昭屯军许昌，以防东吴。昭心中犹豫未决。钟会曰：“大将军新亡，人心未定，将军若留守于此。万一朝廷有变，悔之何及？”昭从之，即起兵还屯洛水之南。髦闻之大惊。太尉王肃奏曰：“昭既继其兄掌大权，陛下可封爵以安之。”髦遂命王肃持诏，封司马昭为大将军、录尚书事。昭入朝谢恩毕。自此，中外大小事情，皆归于昭。却说西蜀细作哨知此事，报入成都。姜维奏后主曰：“司马师新亡，司马昭初握重权，必不敢擅离洛阳。臣请乘间伐魏，以复中原。”后主从之，遂命姜维兴师伐魏。维到汉中，整顿人马。征西大将军张翼曰：“蜀地浅狭，钱粮鲜薄，不宜远征；不如据险守分，恤军爱民：此乃保国之计也。”维曰：“不然。昔丞相未出茅庐，已定三分天下，然且六出祁山以图中原；不幸半途而丧，以致功业未成。今吾既受丞相遗命，当尽忠报国以继其志，虽死而无恨也。今魏有隙可乘，不就此时伐之，更待何时？”夏侯霸曰：“将军之言是也。可将轻骑先出枹罕。若得洮西南安，则诸郡可定。”张翼曰：“向者不克而还，皆因军出甚迟也。兵法云：攻其无备，出其不意。今若火速进兵，使魏人不能提防，必然全胜矣。”\n\n    于是姜维引兵五万，望枹罕进发。兵至洮水，守边军士报知雍州刺史王经、征西将军陈泰。王经先起马步兵七万来迎。姜维分付张翼如此如此，又分付夏侯霸如此如此：二人领计去了；维乃自引大军背洮水列阵。王经引数员牙将出而问曰：“魏与吴、蜀，已成鼎足之势；汝累次入寇，何也？”维曰：“司马师无故废主，邻邦理宜问罪，何况仇敌之国乎？”经回顾张明、花永、刘达、朱芳四将曰：“蜀兵背水为阵。败则皆没于水�\n######################\nOutput:",
