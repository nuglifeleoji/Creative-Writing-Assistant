Beverly Herbert, the wife of acclaimed science fiction author Frank Herbert, passed away in Hawaii in 1984. During their time in Hawaii, Frank Herbert wrote much of the first draft of *Heretics of Dune*, a key installment in his renowned *Dune* series. The islands thus hold significance as both a place of personal loss for the Herbert family and a creative hub for Frank Herbert's literary work. These events highlight Hawaii's role as a setting for both personal and professional milestones in the lives of the Herberts.\",2\n1528,MAUI,\"Maui is an island in Hawaii, renowned for its natural beauty and cultural significance. It is the location of Kawaloa, a place closely associated with Frank Herbert, the acclaimed author of *Dune*, and his wife, Beverly Ann Stuart Forbes Herbert. The couple resided on Maui, where Beverly ultimately passed away at Kawaloa. This connection underscores Maui's role as both a personal retreat and a place of historical importance for the Herbert family. The island's serene landscapes and tranquil environment likely contributed to its appeal as their home.  \n\nIn summary, Maui is a Hawaiian island that served as the residence of Frank and Beverly Herbert, with Kawaloa being the specific location where Beverly died. The descriptions collectively highlight Maui's significance in their lives without contradiction, emphasizing its dual role as a scenic haven and a place of personal history.\",2\n619,BEVERLY HERBERT,\"**Beverly Herbert** was the wife of renowned author **Frank Herbert** and a pivotal figure in his life and creative work.

She also served as the inspiration for the character **Lady Jessica** in Frank Herbert's iconic *Dune* series, and many of the aphorisms familiar to *Dune* fans originated from her insights.  \n\nBeverly Herbert passed away in **1984 in Hawaii**, leaving behind a lasting influence on her husband's work and the science fiction genre as a whole.

While the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they agree on the core relationship: Beverly Herbert was the real-life model for the fictional Lady Jessica, with her traits directly influencing the character's portrayal. The summary consolidates these details into a coherent account, confirming that Lady Jessica's attributes—particularly her grace and foresight—were derived from Beverly Herbert.
