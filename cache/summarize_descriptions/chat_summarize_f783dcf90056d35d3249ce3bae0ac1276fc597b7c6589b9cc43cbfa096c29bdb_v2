It serves as the primary meeting place for the Bene Gesserit Council, where key conspirators and leaders convene to strategize. The planet is renowned for hosting the **Mother School**, the foremost training ground for Bene Gesserit acolytes, including notable figures such as **Lady Jessica** and **Princess Irulan**. Both Jessica and Irulan were educated here, alongside other high-ranking members like the **Reverend Mother**, who also met with Irulan on Wallach IX.  \n\nThe planet is the ninth in the **Laoujin system** and is frequently referenced in historical accounts, such as those involving **Duncan Idaho**, who visited a Bene Gesserit house on Wallach IX. The planet’s significance extends beyond education, as it is a political and spiritual center for the sisterhood, deeply embedded in their traditions and power structures.  \n\nWhile some descriptions vary slightly—mentioning either a \"school,\" \"Mother School,\" or \"Bene Gesserit house\"—they all consistently emphasize Wallach IX’s role as the heart of Bene Gesserit training and governance.
