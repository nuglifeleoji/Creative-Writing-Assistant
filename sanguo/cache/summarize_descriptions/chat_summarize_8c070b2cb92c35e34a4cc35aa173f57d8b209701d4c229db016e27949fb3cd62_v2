Initially, they were rivals engaged in intense power struggles, often clashing as they vied for control and influence within the court. Their conflicts were marked by a fierce competition for dominance, particularly against other powerful figures such as Cao Cao.\n\nDespite their rivalry, circumstances led to a temporary alliance between Li Jue and Guo Zhi. This partnership emerged during their joint efforts to counteract the growing power of Cao Cao, a formidable adversary in the political landscape of the time. In this context, Li Jue and Guo Zhi collaborated in their corrupt practices and manipulation of the court, leveraging their combined influence to further their interests and undermine their common enemy.\n\nThe duality of their relationship—oscillating between rivalry and alliance—highlights the tumultuous nature of the political environment during the late Eastern Han dynasty. Their actions and strategies were driven by the need to navigate the treacherous waters of court politics, where shifting loyalties and power dynamics were the norm.
