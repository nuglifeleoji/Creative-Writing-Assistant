These immense creatures are central to the planet's ecology, the production of the spice melange, and the spiritual beliefs of the Fremen people.  \n\nShai-Hulud is worshipped as a demiurge, often referred to as the \"\"God of the Sands\"\" or the \"\"Divided God\"\" by the Fremen and the priests of Rakis. The sandworms are deeply intertwined with Fremen survival, as their life cycle produces the spice melange, a substance critical to interstellar travel, longevity, and political power in the universe. Their movements shape the desert, and their presence is seen as a harbinger of change, with some prophecies marking their arrival as the beginning of a new cycle of spice abundance and desert dominance.  \n\nIn Fremen mythology, Shai-Hulud is also linked to Leto II Atreides' divine transformation, as he merged with the sandworm biology to become the God Emperor. The sandworms symbolize both destruction and creation, embodying the harsh duality of Arrakis itself. Their spiritual significance is further highlighted in Fremen rituals and personal narratives, such as the context of Lichna's mother's death, where they represent both mortality and transcendence.  \n\nDespite slight variations in terminology—whether described as \"\"giant sandworms,\"\" \"\"the coming of the great sandworm,\"\" or \"\"the Divided God\"\"—the core understanding remains consistent: Shai-Hulud is an omnipresent force on Arrakis, governing the planet's physical and metaphysical realms.
