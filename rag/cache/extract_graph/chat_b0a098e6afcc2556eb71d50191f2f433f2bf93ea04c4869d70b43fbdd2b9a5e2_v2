He could not bring himself to call this\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. | may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—\n“My lungs taste the air of Time Blown past falling sands....”\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert—barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.\nProvided the Harkonnens hadn't managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nA scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms. Blast Shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.\nShuttle’s coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to\nremain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their soacebags over their shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.\n“Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That’s gravity, man!” “How many G’s does this place pull? Feels heavy.” “Nine-tenths of a G by the book.”\nThe crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.\n“Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where’s all the loot this place’s supposed to have?” “The Harkonnens took it with ’em!” “Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!” “Haven’t you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You scrub your ass with sand!” “Hey! Can it! The Duke!”\nThe Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.\nGurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine- string baliset clutched in the other hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.\nThe Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had called him? “Gurney, the valorous.”\nHalleck’s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip Slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed.\n“Gurney,” Leto said.\n“My Lord.” He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. “This is the last of them. I’d have preferred coming in with the first wave, but....”\n“There are still some Harkonnens for you,” the Duke said. “Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk.”\n“Yours to command, my Lord.”\nThey moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.\n“How many men can you let Hawat have?” the Duke asked.\n“Is Thufir in trouble, Sire?”\n“He’s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare—men who won't balk at a little knife work.”\n“I can let him have three hundred of my best,” Halleck said. “Where shall | send them?”\n“To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.”\n“Shall | get about it at once, Sire?”\n“In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttle’s Supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice.”\n“Our spice, m’Lord?”\n“Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime. They’ve opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us.”\n“How strong a persuasion, Sire?”\n“| want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and skills we need. The fact that they’re leaving suggests they’re not part of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.”\n“Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m’Lord.”\n“And there are some he hasn’t found. But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.”\n“Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?”\n“Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. | Suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer\ntwenty per cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens.”\n“No more than that, Sire? | know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them...well, Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.”\nLeto spoke impatiently: “Then use your own discretion in particular cases. Just remember that the treasury isn’t bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men—any with open sand experience.”\n“I understand, Sire. ‘They shall come all for violence: their faces shall Sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.’”\n“A very moving quotation,” the Duke said. “Turn your crew over to a lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will direct them. And don’t forget the men for Hawat.”\n“Three hundred of the best, Sire.” He took up his Spacebag. “Where shall | report to you when I’ve completed my chores?”\n“I’ve taken over a council room topside here. We'll hold staff there. | want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first.”\nHalleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto’s eye. “Are you anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? | thought there was a Judge of the Change here.”\n“Both open battle and secret,” the Duke said. “There'll be blood aplenty spilled here before we're through.”\n““And the water which thou takest out of the river Shall become blood upon the dry land,’” Halleck quoted.\nThe Duke sighed. “Hurry back, Gurney.”\n“Very good, m’Lord.” The whipscar rippled to his grin. “‘Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go | forth to my work.’” He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.\nLeto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual amazement—a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases...and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.\nPresently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were Safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men.\nThe Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a Signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.\nCommand must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nOver the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad’Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father’s first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They said: “O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.”\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n“Trs whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,” the Duke said, “but when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged in...other things.”\nHe knew he wasn’t holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.\nThe Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old- fashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: “Hawat told me that house was secure!”\nPaul spoke hesitantly: “I was angry, too—at first. And | blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would’ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others—including Hawat.”\n“Are you defending him?” the Duke demanded.\n“Yes,”\n“He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—”\n“He’s wise with much experience,” Paul said. “How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?”\n“I should be the one defending him,” the Duke said. “Not you.”\nPaul smiled.\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b0a098e6afcc2556eb71d50191f2f433f2bf93ea04c4869d70b43fbdd2b9a5e2_v2"}
