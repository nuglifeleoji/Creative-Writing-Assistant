Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n842,张鲁,\"张鲁 is a significant historical figure and warlord who ruled over the region of Nanzheng during the late Han dynasty. He is often discussed in the context of military strategies and alliances, particularly concerning his threats to the territory of 刘璋. As a powerful local leader, 张鲁 is recognized for his ambitions and military preparations, notably gearing up his troops for an attack on the strategic location of 葭萌关.\n\n张鲁's relationship with 刘璋 is marked by animosity, as he is seen as a considerable danger to 刘璋's domain. His actions and decisions are pivotal in the ongoing conflicts of the time, and he is involved in military strategies that could alter the balance of power in the region. Additionally, 张鲁 is noted for his aspirations to establish himself as the King of 汉宁, indicating his desire for greater authority and influence.\n\nDespite his military prowess and ambitions, 张鲁 is also mentioned among those considered insignificant in the broader context of heroism, suggesting a complex legacy that intertwines both power and perceived lack of valor. Furthermore, he is recognized as the ruler of 西川 and has attempted to recruit the formidable warrior 马超 to bolster his forces, reflecting his strategic mindset in seeking alliances to enhance his military capabilities.\n\nIn summary, 张鲁 emerges as a multifaceted character whose ambitions, military strategies, and conflicts with 刘璋 define his role in the tumultuous landscape of the late Han dynasty. His preparations for war and attempts to consolidate power illustrate his significance as a warlord, while his portrayal in various contexts reveals the complexities of his character and legacy.\",11\n1990,杨柏,\"杨柏 is a military officer appointed by 张鲁 to oversee the troops during a campaign. In his role, 杨柏 demonstrates a strong sense of duty and loyalty to 张鲁, actively participating in military strategies and operations. He is particularly noted for his opposition to the recruitment of 马超, expressing concerns about 马超's actions and intentions. This apprehension indicates 杨柏's cautious approach to military alliances and his commitment to maintaining the integrity and stability of 张鲁's forces. Through his leadership, 杨柏 plays a crucial role in navigating the complexities of military command and the challenges posed by potential threats within the ranks.\",2\n1998,杨松,\"杨松 is a significant figure in the context of the political and military dynamics involving 张鲁 and 马超. He serves as a strategist for 张鲁, where his role is pivotal in shaping decisions that impact the relationship between 张鲁 and 马超. Notably, 杨松 is known for spreading rumors that sway 张鲁's decisions, particularly those that are detrimental to 马超. This manipulation of information suggests that 杨松 plays a crucial role in the psychological warfare between the two factions.\n\nAdditionally, 杨松's involvement in the strategic planning against 马超 is further complicated by allegations of corruption, specifically regarding his acceptance of bribes. This aspect of his character indicates that his motivations may not solely be based on loyalty or strategic advantage, but also on personal gain. The combination of his strategic influence and questionable ethics paints a complex picture of 杨松 as both a cunning advisor and a potentially self-serving individual.\n\nIn summary, 杨松 is a key strategist for 张鲁, whose actions, including the dissemination of rumors and engagement in corrupt practices, significantly affect the strategies employed against 马超. His dual role as a manipulator of information and a participant in unethical dealings highlights the intricate and often morally ambiguous nature of political maneuvering in this historical context.\",2\n1999,张卫,张卫是张鲁的部下，负责守卫关隘，防止马超的军队进入。,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3157,张鲁,曹操,曹操的势力强大，张鲁可能会受到威胁。,289\n3473,马超,杨柏,杨柏反对张鲁招募马超，二者存在对立关系,41\n3498,杨松,张鲁,杨松是张鲁的谋士，参与了对马超的策略制定，二者关系紧密。,13\n3500,张鲁,张卫,张卫是张鲁的部下，负责守卫关隘，二者关系密切。,12\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
