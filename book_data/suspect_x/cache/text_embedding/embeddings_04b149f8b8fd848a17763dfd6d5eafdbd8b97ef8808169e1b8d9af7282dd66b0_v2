Will you become another Alia?”\nAt last Ghanima leaned against him, whispered: “She has accepted it. She’s gone.”\nHe stroked her head. “Ghani, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. l'II never ask you to do that again. | was selfish. Forgive me.”\n“There’s nothing to forgive,” she said, and her voice came panting as though after great physical exertion. “We've learned much that we needed to know.”\n“She spoke to you of many things,” he said. “We’ll share it later when—”\n“No! We'll do it now. You were right.”\n“My Golden Path?”\n“Your damned Golden Path!”\n“Logic’s useless unless it’s armed with essential data,” he said. “But I—”\n“Grandmother came back to guide our education and to see if we’d been... contaminated.”\n“That’s what Duncan says. There’s nothing new in—”\n“Prime computation,” she agreed, her voice strengthening. She pulled away from him, looked out at the desert which lay in a predawn hush. This battle... this knowledge, had cost them a night. The Royal Guard beyond the moisture seal must have had much to explain. Leto had charged that nothing disturb them.\n“People often learn subtlety as they age,” Leto said. “What is it we’re learning with all of this agedness to draw upon?”\n“The universe as we see it is never quite the exact physical universe,” she said. “We mustn’t perceive this grandmother just as a grandmother.”\n“That'd be dangerous,” he agreed. “But my ques—”\n“There’s something beyond subtlety,” she said. “We must have a place in our awareness to perceive what we can’t preconceive. That’s why ... my mother spoke to me often of Jessica. At the last, when we were both reconciled to the inner exchange, she said many things.” Ghanima sighed.\n“We know she’s our grandmother,” he said. “You were with her for hours yesterday. Is that why—”\n“If we allow it, our knowing will determine how we react to her,” Ghanima said. “That’s what my mother kept warning me. She quoted our grandmother once and—” Ghanima touched his arm. “—I heard the echo of it within me in our grandmother’s voice.”\n“Warning you,” Leto said. He found this thought disturbing. Was nothing in this world dependable?\n“Most deadly errors arise from obsolete assumptions,” Ghanima said. “That’s what my mother kept quoting.”\n“That’s pure Bene Gesserit.”\n“If... if Jessica has gone back to the Sisterhood completely...”\n“That'd be very dangerous to us,” he said, completing the thought. “We carry the blood of their Kwisatz Haderach— their male Bene Gesserit.”\n“They won’t abandon that search,” she said, “but they may abandon us. Our grandmother could be the instrument.”\n“There’s another way,” he said.\n“Yes—the two of us... mated. But they know what recessives might complicate that pairing.”\n“Its a gamble they must've discussed.”\n“And with our grandmother, at that. | don’t like that way.”\n“Nor I.”\n“Still, it’s not the first time a royal line has tried to...”\n“It repels me,” he said, shuddering.\nShe felt the movement, fell silent.\n“Power,” he said.\nAnd in that strange alchemy of their similarities she knew where his thoughts had been. “The power of the Kwisatz Haderach must fail,” she agreed.\n“Used in their way,” he said.\nIn that instant, day came to the desert beyond their vantage point. They sensed the heat beginning. Colors leaped forth from the plantings beneath the cliff. Grey-green leaves sent spiked shadows along the ground. The low morning light of Dune’s silvery sun revealed the verdant oasis full of golden and purple shadows in the well of the Sheltering cliffs.\nLeto stood, stretched.\n“The Golden Path, then,” Ghanima said, and she spoke as much to herself as to him, knowing how their father’s last vision met and melted into Leto’s dreams.\nSomething brushed against the moisture seals behind them and voices could be heard murmuring there.\nLeto reverted to the ancient language they used for privacy: “L’ii ani howr samis sm’kwi owr samit sut.”\nThat was where the decision lodged itself in their awareness. Literally: We will accompany each other into deathliness, though only one may return to report it.\nGhanima stood then and, together, they returned through the moisture seals to the sietch, where the guards roused themselves and fell in behind as the twins headed toward their own quarters. The throngs parted before them with a difference on this morning, exchanging glances with the guards. Spending the night alone above the desert was an old Fremen custom for the holy sages. All the Uma had practiced this form of vigil. Paul Muad’Dib had done it... and Alia. Now the royal twins had begun.\nLeto noted the difference, mentioned it to Ghanima.\n“They don’t know what we’ve decided for them,” she said. “They don’t really know.”\nStill in the private language, he said: “It requires the most fortuitous beginning.”\nGhanima hesitated a moment to form her thoughts. Then: “In that time, mourning for the sibling, it must be exactly real—even to the making of the tomb. The heart must follow the sleep lest there be no awakening.”\nIn the ancient tongue it was an extremely convoluted statement, employing a pronominal object separated from the infinitive. It was a syntax which allowed each set of internal phrases to turn upon itself, becoming several different meanings, all definite and quite distinct but subtly interrelated. In part, what she had said was that they risked death with Leto’s plan and, real or simulated, it made no difference. The resultant change would be like death, literally: “funeral murder.” And there was an added meaning to the whole which pointed accusatively at whoever survived to report, that is: act out the living part. Any misstep there would negate the entire plan, and Leto’s Golden Path would become a dead end.\n“Extremely delicate,” Leto agreed. He parted the hangings for them as they entered their own anteroom.\nActivity among their attendants paused only for a heartbeat as the twins crossed to the arched passage which led into the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica.\n“You are not Osiris,” Ghanima reminded him.\n“Nor will I try to be.”\nGhanima took his arm to stop him. “Alia darsatay haunus m’smow,” she warned.\nLeto stared into his sister’s eyes. Indeed, Alia’s actions did give off a foul smell which their grandmother must have noted. He smiled appreciatively at Ghanima. She had mixed the ancient tongue with Fremen superstition to call up a most basic tribal omen. M’smow, the foul odor of a summer night, was the harbinger of death at the hands of demons. And Isis had been the demon-goddess of death to the people whose tongue they now spoke.\n“We Atreides have a reputation for audacity to maintain,” he said.\n“So we'll take what we need,” she said.\n“It’s that or become petitioners before our own Regency,” he said. “Alia would enjoy that.”\n“But our plan...” She let it trail off.\nOur plan, he thought. She shared it completely now. He said: “I think of our plan as the toil of the shaduf.”\nGhanima glanced back at the anteroom through which they’d passed, smelling the furry odors of morning with their sense of eternal beginning. She liked the way Leto had employed their private language. Toil of the shaduf. It was a pledge. He’d called their plan agricultural work of a very menial kind: fertilizing, irrigating, weeding, transplanting, pruning—yet with the Fremen implication that this labor occurred simultaneously in Another World where it symbolized cultivating the richness of the soul.\nGhanima studied her brother as they hesitated here in the rock passage. It had grown increasingly obvious to her that he was pleading on two levels: one, for the Golden Path of his vision and their father’s, and two, that she allow him free\nreign to carry out the extremely dangerous myth-creation which the plan generated. This frightened her. Was there more to his private vision that he had not shared? Could he see himself as the potentially deified figure to lead humankind into a rebirth—like father, like son? The cult of Muad’Dib had turned sour, fermenting in Alia’s mismanagement and the unbridled license of a military priesthood which rode the Fremen power. Leto wanted regeneration.\nHe’s hiding something from me, she realized.\nShe reviewed what he had told her of his dream. It held such iridescent reality that he might walk around for hours afterward in a daze. The dream never varied, he said.\n“Lam on sand in bright yellow daylight, yet there is no sun. Then I realize that |! am the sun. My light shines out as a Golden Path. When I realize this, | move out of myself. | turn, expecting to see myself as the sun. But I am not the sun; l am a stick figure, a child’s drawing with zigzag lightning lines for eyes, stick legs and stick arms. There Is a scepter in my left hand, and it’s a real scepter—much more detailed in its reality than the stick figure which holds it. The scepter moves, and this terrifies me. As it moves, | feel myself awaken, yet I know I’m still dreaming. | realize then that my skin is encased in something—an armor which moves as my skin moves. | cannot see this armor, but I feel it. My terror leaves me then, for this armor gives me the strength of ten thousand men.”\nAs Ghanima stared at him, Leto tried to pull away, to continue their course toward Jessica’s quarters. Ghanima resisted.\n“This Golden Path could be no better than any other path,” she said.\nLeto looked at the rock floor between them, feeling the strong return of Ghanima’s doubts. “I must do it,” he said.\n“Alia is possessed,” she said. “That could happen to us. could already have happened and we might not know it.”\nt\n“No.” He shook his head, met her gaze. “Alia resisted. That gave the powers within her their strength. By her own strength she was overcome. We've dared to search within, to seek out the old languages and the old knowledge. We’re already amalgams of those lives within us. We don’t resist; we ride with them. This was what I learned from our father last night. It’s what | had to learn.”\n“He said nothing of that within me.”\n“You listened to our mother. It’s what we—”\n“And | almost lost.”\n“Is she still strong within you?” Fear tightened his face.\n“Yes ... but now | think she guards me with her love. You were very good when you argued with her.” And Ghanima thought about the reflected mother-within, said: “Our mother exists now for me in the alam al-mythal with the others, but she has tasted the fruit of hell. Now I can listen to her without fear. As to the others...”\n“Yes,” he said. “And | listened to my father, but I think I’m really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom | was named. Perhaps the name makes it easy.”\n“Are you", " knowledge. We’re already amalgams of those lives within us. We don’t resist; we ride with them. This was what I learned from our father last night. It’s what | had to learn.”\n“He said nothing of that within me.”\n“You listened to our mother. It’s what we—”\n“And | almost lost.”\n“Is she still strong within you?” Fear tightened his face.\n“Yes ... but now | think she guards me with her love. You were very good when you argued with her.” And Ghanima thought about the reflected mother-within, said: “Our mother exists now for me in the alam al-mythal with the others, but she has tasted the fruit of hell. Now I can listen to her without fear. As to the others...”\n“Yes,” he said. “And | listened to my father, but I think I’m really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom | was named. Perhaps the name makes it easy.”\n“Are you counseled to speak to our grandmother of the Golden Path?”\nLeto waited while an attendant pressed past them with a basket-tray carrying the Lady Jessica’s breakfast. A strong smell of spice filled the air as the attendant passed.\n“She lives in us and in her own flesh,” Leto said. “Her counsel can be consulted twice.”\n“Not by me,” Ghanima protested. “I’m not risking that again.”\n“Then by me.”\n“I thought we agreed that she’s gone back to the Sisterhood.”\n“Indeed. Bene Gesserit at her beginning, her own creature in the middle, and Bene Gesserit at the end. But remember that she, too, carries Harkonnen blood and is\ncloser to it than we are, that she has experienced a form of this inner sharing which we have.”\n“A very shallow form,” Ghanima said. “And you haven't answered my question.”\n“I don’t think l'Il mention the Golden Path.”\n“| may.”\n“Ghani!”\n“We don’t need any more Atreides gods! We need a space for some humanity!”\n“Have | ever denied it?”\n“No.” She took a deep breath and looked away from him. Attendants peered in at them from the anteroom, hearing the argument by its tone but unable to understand the ancient words.\n“We have to do it,” he said. “If we fail to act, we might just as well fall upon our knives.” He used the Fremen form which carried the meaning of “spill our water into the tribal cistern.”\nOnce more Ghanima looked at him. She was forced to agree. But she felt trapped within a construction of many walls. They both knew a day of reckoning lay across their path no matter what they did. Ghanima knew this with a certainty reinforced by the data garnered from those other memory-lives, but now she feared the strength which she gave those other psyches by using the data of their experiences. They lurked like harpies within her, shadow demons waiting in ambush.\nExcept for her mother, who had held the fleshly power and had renounced it. Ghanima still felt shaken by that inner struggle, Knowing she would have lost but for Leto’s persuasiveness.\nLeto said his Golden Path led out of this trap. Except for the nagging realization that he withheld something from his vision, she could only accept his sincerity. He needed her fertile creativity to enrich the plan.\n“We'll be tested,” he said, knowing where her doubts led.\n“Not in the spice.”\n“Perhaps even there. Surely, in the desert and in the Trial of Possession.”\n“You never mentioned the Trial of Possession!” she accused. “Is that part of your dream?”\nHe tried to swallow in a dry throat, cursed this betrayal. “Yes.”\n“Then we will be... possessed?”\n“No.”\nShe thought about the Trial—that ancient Fremen examination whose ending most often brought hideous death. Then this plan had other complexities. It would take them onto an edge where a plunge to either side might not be countenanced by the human mind and that mind remain sane.\nKnowing where her thoughts meandered, Leto said: “Power attracts the psychotics. Always. That’s what we have to avoid within ourselves.”\n“You're sure we won't be. . . possessed?” “Not if we create the Golden Path.” Still doubtful, she said: “l'Il not bear your children, Leto.”\nHe shook his head, suppressing the inner betrayals, lapsed into the royal-formal form of the ancient tongue: “Sister mine, | love you more dearly than myself, but that is not the tender of my desires.”\n“Very well, then let us return to another argument before we join our grandmother. A knife slipped into Alia might settle most of our problems.”\n“If you believe that, you believe we can walk in mud and leave no tracks,” he said. “Besides, when has Alia ever given anyone an opportunity?”\n“There is talk about this Javid.”\n“Does Duncan show any signs of growing horns?”\nGhanima shrugged. “One poison, two poison.” It was the common label applied to the royal habit of cataloguing\ncompanions by their threat to your person, a mark of rulers everywhere.\n“We must do it my way,” he said.\n“The other way might be cleaner.”\nBy her reply, he knew she had finally suppressed her doubts and come around to agreement with his plan. The realization brought him no happiness. He found himself looking at his own hands, wondering if the dirt would cling.\nThis was Muad’Dib’s achievement: He saw the subliminal reservoir of each individual as an unconscious bank of memories going back to the primal cell of our common genesis. Each of us, he said, can measure out his distance from that common origin. Seeing this and telling of it, he made the audacious leap of decision. Muad’Dib set himself the task of integrating genetic memory into ongoing evaluation. Thus did he break through Time’s veils, making a single thing of the future and the past. That was Muad’Dib’s creation embodied in his son and his daughter.\n—TESTAMENT OF ARRAKIS BY HARQ AL-ADA\nF arad’n strode through the garden compound of his grandfather’s royal palace, watching his shadow grow shorter as the sun of Salusa Secundus climbed toward noon. He had to stretch himself a bit to keep step with the tall Bashar who accompanied him.\n“| have doubts, Tyekanik,” he said. “Oh, there’s no denying the attractions of a throne, but—” He drew ina deep breath. “—I have so many interests.”\nTyekanik, fresh from a savage argument with Farad’n’s mother, glanced sidelong at the Prince, noting how the lad’s flesh was firming as he approached his eighteenth birthday. There was less and less of Wensicia in him with each passing day and more and more of old Shaddam, who had preferred his private pursuits to the responsibilities of royalty. That was what had cost him the throne in the end, of course. He’d grown soft in the ways of command.\n“You have to make a choice,” Tyekanik said. “Oh, doubtless there’ll be time for some of your interests, but...”\nFarad’n chewed his lower lip. Duty held him here, but he felt frustrated. He would far rather have gone to the rock\nenclave where the sandtrout experiments were being conducted. Now there was a project with enormous potential: wrest the spice monopoly from the Atreides and anything might happen.\n“You're sure these twins will be... eliminated?”\n“Nothing absolutely certain, My Prince, but the prospects are good.”\nFarad’n shrugged. Assassination remained a fact of royal life. The language was filled with the subtle permutations of ways to eliminate important personages. By a single word, one could distinguish between poison in drink or poison in food. He presumed the elimination of the Atreides twins would be accomplished by a poison. It was not a pleasant thought. By all accounts the twins were a most interesting pair.\n“Would we have to move to Arrakis?” Farad’n asked.\n“It’s the best choice, put us at the point of greatest pressure.” Farad’n appeared to be avoiding some question and Tyekanik wondered what it might be.\n“I’m troubled, Tyekanik,” Farad’n said, speaking as they rounded a hedge corner and approached a fountain surrounded by giant black roses. Gardeners could be heard snipping beyond the hedges.\n“Yes?” Tyekanik prompted.\n“This, ah, religion which you've professed .. .”\n“Nothing strange about that, My Prince,” Tyekanik said and hoped his voice remained firm. “This religion speaks to the warrior in me. It’s a fitting religion for a Sardaukar.” That, at least, was true.\n“Yesss ... But my mother seems so pleased by it.” Damn Wensicia! he thought. She’s made her son suspicious.\n“I care not what your mother thinks,” Tyekanik said. “A man’s religion is his own affair. Perhaps she sees something in this that may help to put you on the throne.”\n“That was my thought,” Farad’n said.\nAhhh, this is a sharp lad! Tyekanik thought. He said: “Look into the religion for yourself; you’ll see at once why | chose it.”\n“Still... Muad’Dib’s preachings? He was an Atreides, after all.”\n“I can only say that the ways of God are mysterious,” Tyekanik said.\n“I see. Tell me, Tyvek, why’d you ask me to walk with you just now? It’s almost noon and usually you're off to someplace or other at my mother’s command this time of day.”\nTyekanik stopped at a stone bench which looked upon the fountain and the giant roses beyond. The splashing water soothed him and he kept his attention upon it as he spoke. “My Prince, I’ve done something which your mother may not like.” And he thought: /f he believes that, her damnable scheme will work. Tyekanik almost hoped Wensicia’s scheme would fail. Bringing that damnable Preacher here. She was insane. And the cost!\nAs Tyekanik remained silent, waiting, Farad’n asked: “All right, Tyek, what’ve you done?”\n“I’ve brought a practitioner of oneiromancy,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n shot a sharp glance at his companion. Some of the older Sardaukar played the dream-interpretation game, had done so increasingly since their defeat by that “Supreme Dreamer,” Muad’Dib. Somewhere within their dreams, they reasoned, might lay a way back to power and glory. But Tyekanik had always eschewed this play.\n“This doesn’t sound like you, Tyek,” Farad’n said.\n“Then I can only speak from my new religion,” he said, addressing the fountain. To speak of religion was, of course, why they’d risked bringing The Preacher here.\n“Then speak from this religion,” Farad’n said.\n“As My Prince commands.” He turned, looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled\ninto the path which House Corrino would follow. “Church and state, My Prince, even scientific reason and faith, and even more: progress and tradition—all of these are reconciled in the teachings of Muad’Dib. He taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and, sometimes, in their dreams. One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole.”\nIn spite of doubts which he could not dispel, Farad’n found himself impressed by these words. He heard a note of reluctant sincerity in Tyekan", ",” Farad’n said.\n“Then I can only speak from my new religion,” he said, addressing the fountain. To speak of religion was, of course, why they’d risked bringing The Preacher here.\n“Then speak from this religion,” Farad’n said.\n“As My Prince commands.” He turned, looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled\ninto the path which House Corrino would follow. “Church and state, My Prince, even scientific reason and faith, and even more: progress and tradition—all of these are reconciled in the teachings of Muad’Dib. He taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and, sometimes, in their dreams. One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole.”\nIn spite of doubts which he could not dispel, Farad’n found himself impressed by these words. He heard a note of reluctant sincerity in Tyekanik’s voice, as though the man spoke against inner compulsions.\n“And that’s why you bring me this . .. this interpreter of dreams?”\n“Yes, My Prince. Perhaps your dream penetrates Time. You win back your consciousness of your inner being when you recognize the universe as a coherent whole. Your dreams... well...”\n“But | spoke idly of my dreams,” Farad’n protested. “They are a curiosity, no more. | never once suspected that you...”\n“My Prince, nothing you do can be unimportant.”\n“That’s very flattering, Tyvek. Do you really believe this fellow can see into the heart of great mysteries?”\n“I do, My Prince.”\n“Then let my mother be displeased.”\n“You will see him?”\n“Of course—since you've brought him to displease my mother.”\nDoes he mock me? Tyekanik wondered. And he said: “| must warn you that the old man wears a mask. It is an Ixian device which enables the sightless to see with their skin.”\n“He is blind?”\n“Yes, My Prince.”\n“Does he know who | am?”\n“I told him, My Prince.”\n“Very well. Let us go to him.”\n“If My Prince will wait a moment here, | will bring the man to him.”\nFarad’n looked around the fountain garden, smiled. As good a place as any for this foolishness. “Have you told him what | dreamed?”\n“Only in general terms, My Prince. He will ask you fora personal accounting.”\n“Oh, very well. l'II wait here. Bring the fellow.”\nFarad’n turned his back, heard Tyekanik retire in haste. A gardener could be seen working just beyond the hedge, the top of a brown-capped head, the flashing of shears poking above the greenery. The movement was hypnotic.\nThis dream business is nonsense, Farad’n thought. /t was wrong of Tyek to do this without consulting me. Strange that Tyek should get religion at his age. And now it’s dreams.\nPresently he heard footsteps behind him. Tyekanik’s familiar positive stride and a more dragging gait. Farad’n turned, stared at the approaching dream interpreter. The Ixian mask was a black, gauzy affair which concealed the face from the forehead to below the chin. There were no eye Slits in the mask. If one were to believe the Ixian boasts, the entire mask was a single eye.\nTyekanik stopped two paces from Farad’n, but the masked old man approached to less than a pace.\n“The interpreter of dreams,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n nodded.\nThe masked old man coughed in a remote grunting fashion, as though trying to bring something up from his stomach.\nFarad’n was acutely conscious of a sour spice smell from the old man. It emanated from the long grey robe which covered his body.\n“Is that mask truly a part of your flesh?” Farad’n asked, realizing he was trying to delay the subject of dreams.\n“While | wear it,” the old man said, and his voice carried a bitter twang and just a suggestion of Fremen accent. “Your\ndream,” he said. “Tell me.”\nFarad’n shrugged. Why not? That was why Tyek had brought the old man. Or was it? Doubts gripped Farad’n and he asked: “Are you truly a practitioner of oneiromancy?”\n“I have come to interpret your dream, Puissant Lord.”\nAgain Farad’n shrugged. This masked figure made him nervous and he glanced at Tyekanik, who remained where he had stopped, arms folded, staring at the fountain.\n“Your dream, then,” the old man pressed.\nFarad’n inhaled deeply, began to relate the dream. It became easier to talk as he got fully into it. He told about the water flowing upward in the well, about the worlds which were atoms dancing in his head, about the snake which transformed itself into a sandworm and exploded in a cloud of dust. Telling about the snake, he was surprised to discover, required more effort. A terrible reluctance inhibited him and this made him angry as he spoke.\nThe old man remained impassive as Farad’n at last fell silent. The black gauze mask moved slightly to his breathing. Farad’n waited. The silence continued.\nPresently Farad’n asked: “Aren’t you going to interpret my dream?”\n“I have interpreted it,” he said, his voice seeming to come from a long distance.\n“Well?” Farad’n heard his own voice squeaking, telling him the tension his dream had produced.\nStill the old man remained impassively silent.\n“Tell me, then!” The anger was obvious in his tone.\n“I said I'd interpret,” the old man said. “I did not agree to tell you my interpretation.”\nEven Tyekanik was moved by this, dropping his arms into balled fists at his sides. “What?” he grated.\n“| did not say I’d reveal my interpretation,” the old man said.\n“You wish more pay?” Farad’n asked.\n“I did not ask pay when | was brought here.” A certain cold pride in the response softened Farad’n’s anger. This was a brave old man, at any rate. He must know death could follow disobedience.\n“Allow me, My Prince,” Tyekanik said as Farad’n started to speak. Then: “Will you tell us why you won’t reveal your interpretation?”\n“Yes, My Lords. The dream tells me there would be no purpose in explaining these things.”\nFarad’n could not contain himself. “Are you saying | already know the meaning of my dream?”\n“Perhaps you do, My Lord, but that is not my gist.”\nTyekanik moved up to stand beside Farad’n. Both glared at the old man. “Explain yourself,” Tyekanik said.\n“Indeed,” Farad’n said.\n“If | were to speak of this dream, to explore these matters of water and dust, snakes and worms, to analyze the atoms which dance in your head as they do in mine—ahh, Puissant Lord, my words would only confuse you and you would insist upon misunderstanding.”\n“Do you fear that your words might anger me?” Farad’n demanded.\n“My Lord! You're already angry.”\n“Is it that you don’t trust us?” Tyekanik asked.\n“That is very close to the mark, My Lord. | do not trust either of you and for the simple reason that you do not trust yourselves.”\n“You walk dangerously close to the edge,” Tyekanik said. “Men have been killed for behavior less abusive than yours.”\nFarad’n nodded, said: “Don’t tempt us to anger.”\n“The fatal consequences of Corrino anger are well known, My Lord of Salusa Secundus,” the old man said.\nTyekanik put a restraining hand on Farad’n’s arm, asked: “Are you trying to goad us into killing you?”\nFarad’n had not thought of that, felt a chill now as he considered what such behavior might mean. Was this old man who called himself Preacher... was he more than he appeared? What might be the consequences of his death? Martyrs could be dangerous creations.\n“| doubt that you'll kill me no matter what I say,” The Preacher said. “I think you know my value, Bashar, and your Prince now suspects it.”\n“You absolutely refuse to interpret his dream?” Tyekanik asked.\n“| have interpreted it.”\n“And you will not reveal what you see in it?”\n“Do you blame me, My Lord?”\n“How can you be valuable to me?” Farad’n asked.\nThe Preacher held out his right hand. “If | but beckon with this hand, Duncan Idaho will come to me and he will obey me.”\n“What idle boast is this?” Farad’n asked.\nBut Tyekanik shook his head, recalling his argument with Wensicia. He said: “My Prince, it could be true. This Preacher has many followers on Dune.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me he was from that place?” Farad’n asked.\nBefore Tyekanik could answer, The Preacher addressed Farad’n: “My Lord, you must not feel guilty about Arrakis. You are but a product of your times. This is a special pleading which any man may make when his guilts assail him.”\n“Guilts!” Farad’n was outraged.\nThe Preacher only shrugged.\nOddly, this shifted Farad’n from outrage to amusement. He laughed, throwing his head back, drawing a startled glance from Tyekanik. Then: “I like you, Preacher.”\n“This gratifies me, Prince,” the old man said.\nSuppressing a chuckle, Farad’n said: “We'll find you an apartment here in the palace. You will be my official\ninterpreter of dreams—even though you never give me a word of interpretation. And you can advise me about Dune. | have a great curiosity about that place.”\n“This | cannot do, Prince.”\nAn edge of his anger returned. Farad’n glared at the black mask. “And why not, pray tell?”\n“My Prince,” Tyekanik said, again touching Farad’n’s arm.\n“What is it, Tyvek?”\n“We brought him here under bonded agreement with the Guild. He is to be returned to Dune.”\n“lam summoned back to Arrakis,” The Preacher said.\n“Who summons you?” Farad’n demanded.\n“A power greater than thine, Prince.”\nFarad’n shot a questioning glance at Tyekanik. “Is he an Atreides spy?”\n“Not likely, My Prince. Alia has put a price on his head.”\n“If it’s not the Atreides, then who summons you?” Farad’n asked, returning his attention to The Preacher.\n“A power greater than the Atreides.”\nA chuckle escaped Farad’n. This was only mystic nonsense. How could Tyek be fooled by such stuff? This Preacher had been summoned—most likely by a dream. Of what importance were dreams?\n“This has been a waste of time, Tyek,” Farad’n said. “Why did you subject me to this . . . this farce?”\n“There is a double price here, My Prince,” Tyekanik said. “This interpreter of dreams promised me to deliver Duncan Idaho as an agent of House Corrino. All he asked was to meet you and interpret your dream.” And Tyekanik added to himself: Or so he told Wensicia! New doubts assailed the Bashar.\n“Why is my dream so important to you, old man?” Farad’n asked.\n“Your dream tells me that great events move toward a logical conclusion,” The Preacher said. “I must hasten my return.”\nMocking, Farad’n said: “And you will remain ins"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_04b149f8b8fd848a17763dfd6d5eafdbd8b97ef8808169e1b8d9af7282dd66b0_v2"}
