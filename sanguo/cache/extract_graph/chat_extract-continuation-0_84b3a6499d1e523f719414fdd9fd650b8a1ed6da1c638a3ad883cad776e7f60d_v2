还我头来，然则颜良、文丑，五关六将等众人之头，又将向谁索耶？“于是关公恍然大悟，稽首皈依而去。后往往于玉泉山显圣护民，乡人感其德，就于山顶上建庙，四时致祭。后人题一联于其庙云：“赤面秉赤心、骑赤兔追风，驰驱时无忘赤帝，青灯观青史、仗青龙偃月，隐微处不愧青天。”\n\n    却说孙权既害了关公，遂尽收荆襄之地，赏稿三军，设宴大会诸将庆功；置吕蒙于上位，顾谓众将曰：“孤久不得荆州，今唾手而得，皆子明之功也。”蒙再三逊谢。权曰：“昔周郎雄略过人，破曹操于赤壁，不幸早夭，鲁子敬代之。子敬初见孤时，便及帝王大略，此一快也；曹操东下，诸人皆劝孤降，子敬独劝孤召公瑾逆而击之，此二快也；惟劝吾借荆州与刘备，是其一短。今子明设计定谋，立取荆州，胜子敬、周郎多矣！”于是亲酌酒赐吕蒙。吕蒙接酒欲饮，忽然掷杯于地，一手揪住孙权，厉声大骂曰：“碧眼小儿！紫髯鼠辈！还识我否？”众将大惊，急救时，蒙推倒孙权，大步前进，坐于孙权位上，两眉倒竖，双眼圆睁，大喝曰：“我自破黄巾以来，纵横天下三十余年，今被汝一旦以奸计图我，我生不能啖汝之肉，死当追吕贼之魂！我乃汉寿亭侯关云长也。”权大惊，慌忙率大小将士，皆下拜。只见吕蒙倒于地上，七窍流血而死。众将见之，无不恐惧。权将吕蒙尸首，具棺安葬，赠南郡太守、孱陵侯；命其子吕霸袭爵。孙权自此感关公之事，惊讶不已。\n\n    忽报张昭自建业而来。权召入问之。昭曰：“今主公损了关公父子，江东祸不远矣！此人与刘备桃园结义之时，誓同生死。今刘备已有两川之兵；更兼诸葛亮之谋，张、黄、马、赵之勇。备若知云长父子遇害，必起倾国之兵，奋力报仇，恐东吴难与敌也。”权闻之大惊，跌足曰：“孤失计较也！似此如之奈何？”昭曰：“主公勿忧。某有一计，令西蜀之兵不犯东吴，荆州如磐石之安。”权问何计。昭曰：“今曹操拥百万之众，虎视华夏，刘备急欲报仇，必与操约和。若二处连兵而来，东吴危矣。不如先遣人将关公首级，转送与曹操，明教刘备知是操之所使，必痛恨于操，西蜀之兵，不向吴而向魏矣。吾乃观其胜负，于中取事。此为上策。”\n\n
