刘锋看了他一眼，没再说什么，就是低下头吃饭。\n\n    而接下来的几分钟，刘锋和钱磊对于蓝轩宇的认知开始出现变化了，因为，这家伙实在是太能吃了。\n\n    在蓝轩宇第一次盛饭的时候，钱磊还提醒他说，学院决不允许浪费，取的饭菜一定要都吃完才行，因为那会儿他看蓝轩宇盛的饭菜实在是太多。\n\n    可是，当蓝轩宇去盛第三盘子的时候，他已经目瞪口呆的说不出话来了。这家伙也太能吃了吧？\n\n    蓝轩宇现在确实是越来越能吃了，学院的珍稀食材还是相对少一些的，他就算都一扫而光竟是还有些吃不饱，而普通食物带来的能量自然要差得多了，不知不觉就吃多了。\n\n    “这新来的可真能吃啊！”其他桌的学生们也看到了这边的情况，实在是蓝轩宇去盛饭的次数有点频繁，每次都是冒尖的一大盘子。\n\n    “喂，差不多行了啊！学院的资源是属于大家的，你一个人都吃了好几个人的份了。”一名男生站起身，挡住了准备第四次盛饭的蓝轩宇。\n\n    钱磊立刻就要站起来过来，却被身边的刘锋拉住了，刘锋向他轻轻的摇了摇头。\n\n    蓝轩宇被拦住也是有些发愣，“我吃饭怎么了？学院说可以吃饱的啊！而且，这都是已经做好的饭菜，剩了不久浪费了吗？”\n\n    那男生哼了一声，“我说不让吃就不让你吃。”\n\n    “金翔，你别欺生啊！轩宇是我以前的同学。”叶灵瞳突然站起身，怒气冲冲的说道。\n\n    这叫金翔的男生看了一眼她身边那名身材高大的男生，“吕千寻，这是你的意思？”\n\n    那高大男生淡淡的道：“我不认识他。”说完，站起身就向外走去。\n\n    叶灵瞳愣了一下，而那叫金翔的男生却笑了。\n\n    “让开。”蓝轩宇向金翔说道。\n------------\n\n第八十二章

蓝轩宇抬头看了他一眼，这次没说话，托盘交到左手，右手抬起，向金翔抓去。\n\n    金翔哼了一声，身体微微一侧，让开了蓝轩宇的右手，肩膀一沉，向他胸前撞去。\n\n    能够考上高能少年班的，无不是年轻一代的精\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
