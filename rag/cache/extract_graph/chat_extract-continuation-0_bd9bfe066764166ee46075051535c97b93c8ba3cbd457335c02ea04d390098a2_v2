Bedrock lay exposed in a long narrow avenue of giant boulders, which lay scattered and upturned like the broken building blocks of a mad promethean. Through this wild maze, the sand had poured like a river, leaving its signature in deep scratches and gouges, then plunging off a low escarpment to lose itself in more dunes.\n“Down there,” Sheeana said, pointing at the avenue of bedrock. Off their dune she went, sliding and scrambling in spilled sand. At the bottom, she stopped beside a boulder at least twice her height.\nWaff and Odrade paused just behind her.\nThe slipface of another giant barracan, sinuous as the back of a sporting whale, lifted into the silver-blue sky beside them.\nOdrade used the pause to recompose her oxygen balance. That mad run had made great demands on flesh.\nWaff, she noted, was red-faced and breathing deeply. The flinty cinnamon smell was oppressive in the confined passage. Waff sniffed and rubbed at his nose with the back of a hand. Sheeana lifted herself on one toe, pivoted and darted ten paces across the rocky avenue. She put one foot up on the sandy incline of the outer dune and lifted both arms to the sky. Slowly at first and then with increasing tempo, she began to dance, moving up onto the sand.\nThe ‘thopter sounds grew louder overhead.\n“Listen!” Sheeana called, not pausing in her dance.\nIt was not to the ‘thopters that she called their attention. Odrade turned her head to present both ears to a new sound intruding on their rock-tumbled maze.\nA sibilant hiss, subterranean and muted by sand—it became louder with shocking swiftness. There was heat in it, a noticeable warming of the breeze that twisted down their rocky avenue. The hissing swelled to a crescendo roar. Abruptly, the crystal-ringed gaping of a gigantic mouth lifted over the dune directly above Sheeana.\n“Shaitan!” Sheeana screamed, not breaking the rhythm of her dance. “Here | am, Shaitan!”\nAs it crested the dune, the worm dipped its mouth downward toward Sheeana. Sand cascaded around her feet, forcing her to stop her dance. The smell of cinnamon filled the rocky defile. The worm stopped above them.\n“Messenger of God,” Waff breathed.\nHeat dried the perspiration on Odrade’s exposed face and made the automatic insulation of her stillsuit puff outward perceptibly. She inhaled deeply, sorting the components behind that cinnamon assault. The air around them was Sharp with ozone and swiftly oxygen rich. Her senses at full alert, Odrade stored impressions.\nIf I survive, she thought.\nYes, this was valuable data. The day might come when others would use it.\nSheeana backed out of the spilled sand onto the exposed rock. She resumed her dance, moving more wildly, flinging her head at each turn. Hair whipped across her face and each time she whirled to confront the worm, she screamed “Shaitan!”\nDaintily, like a child on unfamiliar ground, the worm once more moved forward. It slid across the dune crest, curled itself down onto the exposed rock and presented its burning mouth slightly above and about two paces from Sheeana.\nAs it stopped, Odrade became conscious of the deep furnace rumbling of the worm. She could not tear her gaze away from the reflections of lambent orange flames within the creature. It was a cave of mysterious fire.\nSheeana stopped her dance. She clenched both fists at her sides and stared back at the monster she had summoned.\nOdrade took timed breaths, the controlled pacing of a Reverend Mother gathering all of her powers. If this was the end—well, she had obeyed Taraza’s orders. Let the Mother Superior learn what she would from the watchers overhead.\n“Hello, Shaitan,” Sheeana said. “I have brought a Reverend Mother and a man of the Tleilaxu with me.”\nWaff slumped to his knees and bowed.\nOdrade slipped past him to stand beside Sheeana.\nSheeana breathed deeply. Her face was flushed.\nOdrade heard the click-ticking of their overworked stillsuits. The hot, cinnamon-drenched air around them was charged with the sounds of this meeting, all dominated by the murmurous burning within the quiescent worm.\nWaff came up beside Odrade, his trancelike gaze fixed on the worm.\n“lam here,” he whispered.\nOdrade silently cursed him. Any unwarranted noise could attract this beast onto them. She knew what Waff was thinking, though: No other Tleilaxu had ever stood this close\nto a descendant of his Prophet. Not even the Rakian priests had ever done this!\nWith her right hand, Sheeana made a sudden downward gesture. “Down to us, Shaitan!” she said.\nThe worm lowered its gaping mouth until the internal firepit filled the rocky defile in front of them.\nHer voice little more than a whisper, Sheeana said: “See how Shaitan obeys me, Mother?”\nOdrade could feel Sheeana’s control over the worm, a pulse of hidden language between child and monster. It was uncanny.\nHer voice rising in impudent arrogance, Sheeana said: “I will ask Shaitan to let us ride him!” She scrambled up the Slipface of the dune beside the worm.\nImmediately, the great mouth lifted to follow her movements. “Stay there!” Sheeana shouted. The worm stopped.\nIt’s not her words that command it, Odrade thought. Something else... something else...\n“Mother, come with me,” Sheeana called.\nThrusting Waff ahead of her, Odrade obeyed. They scrambled up the sandy slope behind Sheeana. Dislodged sand spilled down beside the waiting worm, piling up in the defile. Ahead of them, the worm’s tapering tail curved along the dune crest. Sheeana led them at a sand-clotted trot to the very tip of the thing. There, she gripped the leading edge of a ring in the corrugated surface and scrambled up onto her desert beast.\nMore slowly, Odrade and Waff followed. The worm’s warm surface felt non-organic to Odrade, as though it were some Ixian artifact.\nSheeana skipped forward along the back and squatted just behind its mouth where the rings bulged thick and wide.\n“Like this,” Sheeana said. She leaned forward and clutched beneath the leading edge of a ring, lifting it slightly to expose pink softness underneath.\nWaff obeyed her immediately but Odrade moved with more caution, storing impressions. The ring surface was as hard as plascrete and covered with tiny encrustations. Odrade’s fingers probed the softness under the leading edge. It pulsed faintly. The surface around them lifted and fell with an almost imperceptible rhythm. Odrade heard a tiny rasping with each movement.\nSheeana kicked the worm surface behind her.\n“Shaitan, go!” she said.\nThe worm did not respond.\n“Please, Shaitan,” Sheeana pleaded.\nOdrade heard the desperation in Sheeana’s voice. The child was so confident of her Shaitan but Odrade knew that the girl had been allowed to ride only that first time. Odrade had the full story from death-wish to priestly confusion but none of it told her what would happen next.\nAbruptly, the worm lurched into motion. It lifted sharply, twisted to the left and made a tight curve out of the rocky defile, then moved directly away from Dar-es-Balat into the open desert.\n“We go with God!” Waff shouted.\nThe sound of his voice shocked Odrade. Such wildness! She sensed the power in his faith. The thwock-thwock of following ornithopters came from overhead. The wind of their passage whipped past Odrade full of ozone and the hot furnace odors stirred up by the friction of the rushing behemoth.\nOdrade glanced over her shoulders at the ’thopters, thinking how easy it would be for enemies to rid this planet of a troublesome child, an equally troublesome Reverend Mother and a despised Tleilaxu—all in one violently vulnerable moment on the open desert. The priestly cabal might attempt it, she knew, hoping that Odrade’s own watchers up there would be too late to prevent it.\nWould curiosity and fear hold them back?\nOdrade admitted to a mighty curiosity herself.\nWhere is this thing taking us?\nCertainly, it was not headed toward Keen. She lifted her head and peered past Sheeana. On the horizon directly ahead lay that telltale indentation of fallen stones, that place where the Tyrant had been spilled from the surface of his faery bridge.\nThe place of Other Memory warning.\nAbrupt revelation locked Odrade’s mind. She understood the warning. The Tyrant had died at a place of his own choosing. Many deaths had left their imprint on that place but his the greatest. The Tyrant chose his peregrination route with purpose. Sheeana had not told her worm to go there. It moved that way of its own volition. The magnet of the Tyrant’s endless dream drew it back to the place where the dream began.\nThere was this drylander who was asked which was more important, a literjon of water or a vast pool of water? The drylander thought a moment and then said: “The literjon is more important. No single person could own a great pool of water. But a literjon you could hide under your cloak and run away with it. No one would know.”\n—THE JOKES OF ANCIENT DUNE, BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nt was a long session in the no-globe’s practice hall,\nDuncan in a mobile cage driving the exercise, adamant that this particular training series would continue until his new body had adapted to the seven central attitudes of combat response against attack from eight directions. His green singlesuit was dark with perspiration. Twenty days they had been at this one lesson!\nTeg knew the ancient lore that Duncan revived here but knew it by different names and sequencing. Before they had been into it five days, Teg doubted the superiority of modern methods. Now, he was convinced that Duncan did something completely new—mixing the old with what he had learned in the Keep.\nTeg sat at his own control console, as much an observer as a participant. The consoles that guided the dangerous shadow forces in this practice had required mental adjustment by Teg, but he felt familiar with them now and moved the attack with facility and frequent inspiration.\nA simmering Lucilla glanced into the hall occasionally. She watched and then left without comment. Teg did not know what Duncan was doing about the Imprinter but there was a feeling that the reawakened ghola played a delaying game with his seductress. She would not allow that to continue long, Teg knew, but it was out of his hands. Duncan no\nlonger was “too young” for the Imprinter. That young body carried a mature male mind with experiences from which to make his own decisions.\nDuncan and Teg had been on the floor with only one break all morning. Hunger pangs gnawed at Teg but he felt reluctant to halt the session. Duncan’s abilities had climbed to a new level today and he was still improving.\nTeg, seated in a fixed console’s cage seat\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANA<|>PERSON<|>Ana is a character whose attention is fixed on the events unfolding in the desert, likely observing the interaction with the sandworm and Sheeana's dance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young girl who demonstrates an uncanny ability to summon and control a sandworm, referred to as Shaitan, through a dance and commands.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>Waff is a Tleilaxu man who is deeply moved by the encounter with the sandworm, viewing it as a religious experience and a connection to his Prophet.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother who observes and analyzes the interaction between Sheeana and the sandworm, storing valuable data for the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, deeply involved in the events on the desert planet.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and genetically manipulative group, represented by Waff, who has a profound religious experience with the sandworm.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAR-ES-BALAT<|>GEO<|>Dar-es-Balat is a location on the desert planet from which the sandworm departs into the open desert with Sheeana, Odrade, and Waff.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEEN<|>GEO<|>Keen is a location on the horizon, not the destination of the sandworm, which instead heads toward the place where the Tyrant died.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRANT'S DEATH PLACE<|>GEO<|>The place where the Tyrant died, marked by fallen stones, is a significant location with imprints of many deaths, drawing the sandworm there.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDWORM ENCOUNTER<|>EVENT<|>The encounter with the sandworm, Shaitan, is a pivotal event where Sheeana demonstrates her control over the creature, leading to a ride on its back.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan is a ghola undergoing intense combat training, reviving ancient methods and adapting them with modern techniques under Teg's guidance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a mentor and observer in Duncan's combat training, operating the control console and recognizing the value of Duncan's mixed methods.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILLA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is an Imprinter who occasionally observes Duncan's training, seemingly impatient with his delaying tactics regarding her seduction.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>SHARKS<|>Sheeana is under the observation and potential control of the Bene Gesserit, who are interested in her ability to command the sandworm.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>TLEILAXU<|>Waff is a member of the Tleilaxu, representing their religious and genetic interests in the sandworm encounter.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHARKS<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, tasked with gathering data on Sheeana and the sandworm.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>SANDWORM ENCOUNTER<|>Sheeana is the central figure in the sandworm encounter, summoning and controlling the creature through her dance.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>SANDWORM ENCOUNTER<|>Waff experiences a profound religious moment during the sandworm encounter, connecting it to his Prophet.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SANDWORM ENCOUNTER<|>Odrade observes and analyzes the sandworm encounter, storing valuable data for the Bene Gesserit.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>TEG<|>Duncan is undergoing combat training under Teg's guidance, mixing ancient and modern methods.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>LUCILLA<|>Teg observes Lucilla's impatience with Duncan's delaying tactics regarding her seduction.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>LUCILLA<|>Duncan is delaying Lucilla's seduction, playing a waiting game with the Imprinter.<|>7\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
