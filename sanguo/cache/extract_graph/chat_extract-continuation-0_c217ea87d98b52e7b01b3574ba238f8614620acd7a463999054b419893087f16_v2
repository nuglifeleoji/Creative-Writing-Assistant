瑾不得已，只得回东吴见孙权，具言前事。孙权大怒曰：“子瑜此去，反覆奔走，莫非皆是诸葛亮之计？”瑾曰：“非也。吾弟亦哭告玄德，方许将三郡先还，又无奈云长恃顽不肯，”孙权曰：“既刘备有先还三郡之言，便可差官前去长沙、零陵、桂阳三郡赴任，且看如何。”瑾曰：“主公所言极善。”权乃令瑾取回老小，一面差官往三郡赴任。不一日，三郡差去官吏，尽被逐回，告孙权曰：“关云长不肯相容，连夜赶逐回吴。迟后者便要杀。”\n\n    孙权大怒，差人召鲁肃责之曰：“子敬昔为刘备作保，借吾荆州；今刘备已得西川，不肯归还，子敬岂得坐视？”肃曰：“肃已思得一计，正欲告主公。”权问：“何计？”肃曰：“今屯兵于陆口，使人请关云长赴会。若云长肯来，以善言说之；如其不从，伏下刀斧手杀之。如彼不肯来，随即进兵，与决胜负，夺取荆州便了。”孙权曰：“正合吾意。可即行之。”阐泽进曰：“不可，关云长乃世之虎将，非等闲可及。恐事不谐，反遭其害。”孙权怒曰：“若如此，荆州何日可得！”便命鲁肃速行此计。肃乃辞孙权，至陆口，召吕蒙、甘宁商议，设宴于陆口寨外临江亭上，修下请书，选帐下能言快语一人为使，登舟渡江。江口关平问了，遂引使者入荆州，叩见云长，具道鲁肃相邀赴会之意，呈上请书。云长看书毕，谓来人曰：“既子敬相请，我明日便来赴宴。汝可先回。”\n\n
