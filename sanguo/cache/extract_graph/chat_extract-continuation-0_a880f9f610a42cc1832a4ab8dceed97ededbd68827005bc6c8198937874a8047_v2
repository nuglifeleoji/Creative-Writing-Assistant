�，奏辞归乡养病。炎间曰：“卿有何安邦之策，以教寡人？”祜曰：“孙皓暴虐已甚，于今可不战而克。若皓不幸而殁，更立贤君，则吴非陛下所能得也。”炎大悟曰：“卿今便提兵往伐，若何？”祜曰：“臣年老多病，不堪当此任。陛下另选智勇之士可也。”遂辞炎而归。\n\n    是年十一月，羊祜病危，司马炎车驾亲临其家问安。炎至卧榻前，祜下泪曰：“臣万死不能报陛下也！”炎亦泣曰：“朕深恨不能用卿伐吴之策。今日谁可继卿之志？”祜含泪而言曰：“臣死矣，不敢不尽愚诚：右将军杜预可任；劳伐吴，须当用之。”炎曰：“举善荐贤，乃美事也；卿何荐人于朝，即自焚奏稿，不令人知耶？”祜曰：“拜官公朝，谢恩私门，臣所不取也。”言讫而亡。炎大哭回宫，敕赠太傅、巨平侯。南州百姓闻羊祜死，罢市而哭。江南守边将士，亦皆哭泣。襄阳人思祜存日，常游于岘山，遂建庙立碑，四时祭之。往来人见其碑文者，无不流涕，故名为堕泪碑。后人有诗叹曰：“晓日登临感晋臣，古碑零落岘山春。松间残露频频滴，疑是当年堕泪人。”晋主以羊祜之言，拜杜预为镇南大将军都督荆州事。杜预为人，老成练达，好学不倦，最喜读左丘明《春秋传》，坐卧常自携，每出入必使人持《左传》于马前，时人谓之“《左传》癖”。及奉晋主之命，在襄阳抚民养兵，准备伐吴。\n\n    此时吴国丁奉、陆抗皆死，吴主皓每宴群臣，皆令沉醉；又置黄门郎十人为纠弹官。宴罢之后，各奏过失，有犯者或剥其面，或凿其眼。由是国人大惧。晋益州刺史王濬上疏请伐吴。其疏曰：“孙皓荒淫凶逆，宜速征伐。若一旦皓死，更立贤主，则强敌也；臣造船七年，日有朽败；臣年七十，死亡无日：三者一乖，则难图矣。愿陛下无失事机。”晋主览疏，遂与群臣议曰：“王公之论，与羊都督暗合。朕意决矣。”侍中王浑奏曰：“臣闻孙皓欲北上，军伍已皆整备，声势正盛，难与争锋。更迟一年以待其疲，方可成功。”晋主依其奏，乃降诏止兵莫动，退入后宫，与秘书丞张华围棋消遣。近臣奏边庭有表到。晋主开视之，乃杜预表也。表略云：“往者，羊祜不博谋于朝臣，而密与陛下计，故令朝臣多异同之议。凡事当以利害相�\n######################\nOutput:",
