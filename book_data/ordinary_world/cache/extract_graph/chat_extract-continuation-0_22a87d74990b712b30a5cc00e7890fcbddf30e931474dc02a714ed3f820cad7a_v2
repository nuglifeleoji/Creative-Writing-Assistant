\n　　少平看见，晓霞已经完全是一副大学生的派头了，个码似乎也比中学高了许多。一头黑发散乱地披在肩头，上面沾着碎银屑似的水珠。合身的风雨衣用一根带子束着腰，脚上是一双棕色旅游鞋。 \n　　但是，站在这个人的面前，不知为什么，少平并不为自己的一身破衣服而感到害躁。相反，他觉得穿这身衣服见她正“合适”。 \n　　“何去何从？”她笑着把手中的票晃了晃。 \n　　“我当然放弃了‘复仇’！”少平脸上的燥热渐渐消退了。 \n　　晓霞嘿嘿一笑，她很快把那张票向旁边“钓鱼”的人处理掉，便引着孙少平向地委走去。 \n　　“你为什么不给我回信？”晓霞一边走，一边问他。少平无言以对。 \n　　他听见“蓬”一声，心一惊。扭头一看，晓霞手中撑开了一把湖蓝色的自动伞。 \n　　她向他挨近了一些，把雨伞遮在两个人的头上。他顿时感到自己沉浸在一片迷朦的湖蓝色的梦幻之中……近两年了，他没有见晓霞的面，他原来想，一年前他没有答理她最后的那封信，他们的联系也就随之永远地断绝了。她将会变成自己记忆里的一个人，而在现实中他们再不可能见面。是呀，人家是大学生，他是一个乡巴佬。相差如同天上人间……可是，现在却猛然和她相遇在了这秋雨绵绵的黄原街头…… \n　　“你怎不回答我的问话呢？”她在雨伞下转过脸，瞅着他。“一切都很明白……”他说。 \n　　“是因为我上了大学，你仍然是个农民吧？看来，你还是世俗的！”晓霞不客气地说。 \n　　少平心里不同意老同学对他的评价。其实，他在灵魂深处并没有低看自己。她显然不了解他这两年的变化。他之所以不愿和她再联系。的确是因为两个人在生活中的处境差异太大。但这并不是说，他认为所走的道路就比上大学低贱。是的，他是在社会的最低层挣扎，为了几个钱而受尽折磨；但他已不仅仅将此看作是谋生活命——职业的高贵与低贱，不能说明一个人生活的价值。恰恰相反，他现在倒很“热爱”自己的苦难。通过一段血火般的洗礼，他相信，自己历尽千辛万苦而酿造出的生活之蜜，肯定比轻而易举拿来的更有滋味——他自嘲地把自己的这种认识叫做“关于苦难的学说”……晓霞把他引进了地委大门。看门房的老头在玻璃后面满脸堆笑向晓霞点了点头，他们就径直穿过一个大院，又通过一道小门，来到一个安静的小院落。 \n　　晓霞对他说：“这是常委院。”她又指了指旁边一座四层楼，“那是地委家属楼，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少平<|>PERSON<|>少平 is a character who feels a sense of
