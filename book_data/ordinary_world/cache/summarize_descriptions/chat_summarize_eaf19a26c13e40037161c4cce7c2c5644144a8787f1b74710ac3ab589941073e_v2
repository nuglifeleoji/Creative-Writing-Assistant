It is a place where individuals, such as 孙少平 and 明明, go to collect coal while also enjoying the natural surroundings. This dual function highlights the area's importance not only as a resource for coal but also as a space for leisure and connection with nature.\n\nAdditionally, 矸石山 holds deeper symbolic meaning, particularly for coal miners. It represents the struggles and hardships faced by those in the mining industry, as it is a site where miners gather to collect leftover coal. This aspect underscores the challenges and resilience of coal miners, who often work under difficult conditions to extract valuable resources from the earth.\n\nOverall, 矸石山 embodies both a practical resource for coal collection and a poignant reminder of the labor and perseverance associated with the mining community.
