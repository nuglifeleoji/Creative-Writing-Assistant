What are your orders?”\nPiter spoke to Jessica. “I’d thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but | begin to see that would not have worked. | let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: “Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found.”\n“You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?” Scarface asked.\nHe reads lips, Jessica thought.\n“I follow my Baron’s example,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor said.”\nJessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.\nPiter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out without turning.\n“Me, | wouldn’t like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this night’s work,” Scarface said.\n“You ain’t likely ever to run into that old witch,” one of the other troopers said. He went around to Jessica’s head, bent over her. “It ain’t getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and—”\n“Why’n’t we kill ’em here?” Scarface asked.\n“Too messy,” the first one said. “Unless you wants to strangle ’em. Me, | likes a nice straightforward job. Drop ’em on the desert like that traitor said, cut ’em once or twice, leave the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up afterwards.”\n“Yeah...well, | guess you’re right,” Scarface said.\nJessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.\nScarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor- buoyed litter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter, she saw her companion’s face—Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.\nIs he drugged? she wondered.\nThe troopers lifted the litter, and Paul’s eyes opened the smallest fraction—dark slits staring at her.\nHe mustn't try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!\nPaul’s eyes closed.\nHe had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.\nPaul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother’s face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though.\nHe wondered who could've captured her. His own captivity was plain enough—to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it —a Suk doctor a traitor.\nThe litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A ’thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground.\nPaul’s eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the ‘thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.\n“This the ‘thopter we're supposed to use?” he asked, and turned to watch his companion’s lips.\n“It’s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,” the other said.\nScarface nodded. “But—it’s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain’t room in there for more’n them an’\ntwo of us.”\n“Two’s enough,” said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading. “We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.”\n“The Baron, he told me to make sure what happened to them two,” Scarface said.\n“What you so worried about?” asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer.\n“She is a Bene Gesserit witch,” the deaf one said. “They have powers.”\n“Ah-h-h....” The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. “One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.”\nThe trooper behind him grunted. “She'll be worm meat soon enough. Don’t suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?” He nudged the litter-bearer.\n“Yee-up,” the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica’s shoulders. “C’mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens.”\n“It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,” Scarface said.\nJessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning —stars. She was pushed into the rear of the 'thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope.\nScarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat.\nKinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The ‘thopter took off in a wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his companion’s shoulder, said: “Whyn’t you turn around and keep an eye on them two?”\n“Sure you know the way to go?” Kinet watched Czigo’s lips.\n“I listened to the traitor same’s you.”\nKinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of Starlight on a lasgun in his hand. The ‘thopter’s light- walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guard’s scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would Snap at a sudden jerk.\nHas someone been at this ’thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul’s.\n“Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this,” Scarface said. “You ever have any highborn types?” He turned to look at the pilot.\n“Bene Gesserit ain’t all highborn,” the pilot said.\n“But they all looks heighty.”\nHe can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.\n“Real pretty, she is,” Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. “Sure do seem a shame.” He looked at Czigo.\n“You thinking what I think you’re thinking?” the pilot asked.\n“Who'd be to know?” the guard asked. “Afterwards....” He shrugged. “I just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again.”\n“You lay a hand on my mother....” Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.\n“Hey!” the pilot laughed. “Cub’s got a bark. Ain’t got no bite, though.”\nAnd Jessica thought: Paul’s pitching his voice too high. It may work, though.\nThey flew on in silence.\nThese poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron’s words. They'll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.\nThe ‘thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.\n“This oughta be far enough,” the pilot said. “The traitor said to put ’em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.” He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.\nJessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn’t mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails....\nThe ‘thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, Saw a Shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.\nSomeone’s following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there’ll\nbe watchers for the watchers, too.\nCzigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.\nJessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.\nPaul cleared his throat.\nThe pilot said: “Now, Kinet?”\n“| dunno, Czigo.”\nCzigo turned, said: “Ah-h-h, look.” He reached out for Jessica’s skirt.\n“Remove her gag,” Paul commanded.\nJessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent—imperative, very sharp. A Slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man’s spectrum.\nCzigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica’s mouth, slipped the knot on the gag.\n“Stop that!” Kinet ordered.\n“Ah, shut your trap,” Czigo said. “Her hands’re tied.” He freed the knot and the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.\nKinet put a hand on the pilot’s arm. “Look, Czigo, no need to....”\nJessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. “Gentlemen! No need to fight over me.” At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet’s benefit.\nShe saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over\nher. Their disagreement required no other reason. In their minds, they were fighting over her.\nShe held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: “You mustn’t disagree.” They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other. “Is any woman worth fighting over?” she asked.\nBy uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.\nPaul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now—everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.\n“Yeah,” Scarface said. “No need to fight over....”\nHis hand flashed toward the pilot’s neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet’s chest.\nScarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.\n“Thought | was some dummy didn’t know that trick,” Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\n“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.\n“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.\nCzigo hesitated.\n“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5be0108847dcf48b94a4eea5ac4b206704ce60413d095f1d55dfe58477766fc4_v2"}
