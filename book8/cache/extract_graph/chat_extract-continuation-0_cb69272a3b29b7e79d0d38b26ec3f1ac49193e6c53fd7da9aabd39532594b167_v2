虽然她很多记忆都不在了，可伴随着时间的推移，尤其是对自身能力方面的记忆，她还是恢复了一些。空间同位共振，尤其是如此远距离的共振，这需要空间波动极其相似才有可能联系上。是轩宇和千秋之间的共振？亦或是跟自己之间的？\n\n    这必须要通过一些实验才能验证了，现在就等，下次看什么时候，他们会再尝试召唤千秋时看看情况。\n\n    而此时，天罗城，天罗学院。\n\n    模拟舱缓缓开启，蓝轩宇三人从里面钻了出来。\n\n    三人面面相觑，着实是都有些震撼。\n\n    蓝轩宇显得比较疲惫，他吃惊的发现，在用了金龙升天之后，哪怕是在模拟世界里，也没法完全恢复他的消耗。魂力是基本恢复了的，但精神力层面的消耗却只能恢复很小一部分。所以也就只能是先结束斗罗世界中的活动退出来。当然，那一枚斗罗币是又赢了的。\n\n    这是蓝轩宇第一次尝试使用金龙升天，效果比想象中还要好。\n\n    “轩宇。好像你也能增强我啊！”刘锋第一个跳出模拟舱，主动来到蓝轩宇这边，把他扶着走了出来。\n\n    他的洞察力相当不弱，所以，他完全可以肯定，在自己先前挥出那一枪的时候，是蓝轩宇增强了他的攻击力，否则那样的距离，根本不可能把三头熔岩犬挑起来，而且那可是三头百年魂兽，正常情况下，就算他能挑起来，自己也会因为反震力受到重创。可刚刚那一下，他却毫发无伤，而且他明显感觉到，这可能是自己有史以来用出过的最完美的一枪。\n\n    蓝轩宇自己也是十分好奇，自己和两位室友连接在一起时，竟然都莫名其妙的会增强他们。而这样的情况他以前并没有尝试过，也没有发现过。只是曾经压制过叶灵瞳。\n\n    阵阵虚弱感传来，打断了他的思路。\n\n    “走吧，先回去休息会儿，我需要吃点东西。饿了。”\n\n    此时距离吃饭的时间也差不多了，刘锋和钱磊搀扶着精神虚弱的蓝轩宇索性直接去了食堂。\n\n    他们是第一个来的，厨师们还在给高能少年班的学生们准备晚餐。\n\n    一进门，钱磊就嚷嚷起来，“师傅们，有没有什么补脑的好吃的？”\n\n    “又是你这小子，看你都胖成这样了，还惦记着吃补品吗？哈哈。”一名身材壮硕的厨师忍不住取笑道。\n\n    钱磊呵呵一笑，“我哪里胖了，我这不跟您一样吗？这叫壮硕。中午我们没怎么吃饭，这不是饿了吗？啥时候能开饭啊？”\n\n
