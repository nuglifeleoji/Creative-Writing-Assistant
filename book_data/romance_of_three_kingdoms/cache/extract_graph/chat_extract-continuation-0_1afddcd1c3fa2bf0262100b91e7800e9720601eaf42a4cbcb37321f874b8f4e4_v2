�单枪，来到天水城下叫门。城上军见是姜维，慌报马遵。遵曰：“此是姜维来赚我城门也。”令城上乱箭射下。姜维回顾蜀兵至近，遂飞奔上邽城来。城上梁虔见了姜维，大骂曰：“反国之贼，安敢来赚我城池！吾已知汝降蜀矣！”遂乱箭射下。姜维不能分说，仰天长叹，两眼泪流，拨马望长安而走。行不数里，前至一派大树茂林之处，一声喊起，数千兵拥出：为首蜀将关兴，截住去路。\n\n    维人困马乏，不能抵当，勒回马便走。忽然一辆小车从山坡中转出。其人头戴纶巾，身披鹤氅，手摇羽扇，乃孔明也。孔明唤姜维曰：“伯约此时何尚不降？”维寻思良久，前有孔明，后有关兴，又无去路，只得下马投降。孔明慌忙下车而迎，执维手曰：“吾自出茅庐以来，遍求贤者，欲传授平生之学，恨未得其人。今遇伯约，吾愿足矣。”维大喜拜谢。\n\n    孔明遂同姜维回寨，升帐商议取天水、上邽之计。维曰：“天水城中尹赏、梁绪，与某至厚；当写密书二封，射入城中，使其内乱，城可得矣。”孔明从之。姜维写了二封密书，拴在箭上，纵马直至城下，射入城中。小校拾得，呈与马遵。遵大疑，与夏侯楙商议曰：“梁绪、尹赏与姜维结连，欲为内应，都督宜早决之。”楙曰：“可杀二人。”尹赏知此消息，乃谓梁绪曰：“不如纳城降蜀，以图进用。”是夜，夏侯楙数次使人请梁、尹二人说话。二人料知事急，遂披挂上马，各执兵器，引本部军大开城门，放蜀兵入。夏侯楙、马遵惊慌，引数百人出西门，弃城投羌胡城而去。梁绪、尹赏迎接孔明入城。安民已毕，孔明问取上邽之计。梁绪曰：“此城乃某亲弟梁虚守之，愿招来降。”孔明大喜。绪当日到上都唤梁虔出城来降孔明。孔明重加赏劳，就令梁绪为天水太守，尹赏为冀城令，梁虔为上邽令。孔明分拨已毕，整兵进发。诸将问曰：“丞相何不去擒夏侯楙？”孔明曰：“吾放夏侯楙，如放一鸭耳。今得伯约，得一凤也！”孔明自得三城之后，威声大震，远近州郡，望风归降。孔明整顿军马，尽提汉中之兵，前出祁山，兵临渭水之西。细作报入洛阳。时魏主曹睿太和元年，升殿设朝。近臣奏曰：“夏侯驸马已失三郡，逃窜羌中去了。今蜀兵已到祁山，前军临渭水之西，乞早发兵\n######################\nOutput:",
