As the highest authority in the imperial court, the emperor is the ruler whose favor is sought by various military leaders, including Sima Yi, who aims to gain support for his endeavors. The emperor is also depicted as a figure of protection, being safeguarded by loyal subjects such as 杨奉 and others.\n\nIn the context of political machinations, the emperor is manipulated by powerful figures like 董卓, highlighting the precarious nature of his position. Despite being the ultimate authority in the realm, the emperor faces significant threats, including the risk of being kidnapped, which underscores the dangers inherent in his role. This vulnerability is further illustrated by the actions of loyal generals like 黄忠, who serve the emperor and demonstrate their commitment to the imperial authority.\n\nThe emperor, referred to as 天子, is not only a figure of power but also a symbol of aspiration for others, such as 袁术, who seeks to elevate his own status to that of the emperor. The emperor's authority is further emphasized by acts of trust, such as when he grants 董承 a royal robe and belt, signaling a call to action against the formidable warlord Cao Cao.\n\nOverall, the emperor, as 天子, embodies the complexities of leadership during a tumultuous period in Chinese history, where loyalty, manipulation, and the struggle for power intertwine. His role is pivotal, as he navigates the treacherous waters of political intrigue while remaining the focal point of loyalty and ambition among his subjects.\",22\n571,安邑,\"安邑 is a significant location in historical context, particularly noted for its role in political and military affairs.

He was an ally of 韩暹, sharing a common goal of restoring the Han dynasty to its former glory. As a general, 杨奉 took on the critical role of protecting the emperor during a tumultuous period marked by internal strife and external threats.\n\nIn his military endeavors, 杨奉 fought valiantly against enemy forces led by 郭汜 and 李傕, who posed significant challenges to the stability of the Han regime. His commitment to the emperor and the Han dynasty was evident in his alliances, including a partnership with 袁术, although this alliance ultimately led to his demise amidst the ongoing conflicts.\n\n杨奉 also collaborated with 董承, another military leader, to safeguard the emperor and navigate the complex political landscape of the time. Despite his efforts and dedication, 杨奉 felt a deep sense of frustration due to the lack of recognition for his contributions. This discontent fueled his desire to take action against 李傕, whom he viewed as a significant threat to the Han dynasty and his own ambitions.\n\nIn summary, 杨奉 was a military officer deeply invested in the protection of the Han emperor and the restoration of the Han dynasty.
