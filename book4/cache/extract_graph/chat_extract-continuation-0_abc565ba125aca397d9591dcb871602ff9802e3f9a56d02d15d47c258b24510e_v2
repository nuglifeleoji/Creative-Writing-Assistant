\n　　孙少平伏在泥水中，绝望地呻吟着。大雨在头顶哗哗浇泼，满天黑色的云朵，潮水般向北涌去。铁道那面的黑水河，发出呜咽似的声响。远处，矸石山那里，矸石噼噼啪啪在向深沟中滚落。滚落！整个大地都在向深渊滚落……不知过了多少时候，当孙少平满身泥浆返回宿舍，那神态已经完全象一个疯子或纯粹的白痴。同宿舍的人看他这副样子，都吓住了，谁也没敢问他个长短。 \n　　他换了身衣服，便倒在床铺中，两眼呆呆地望着雪白的蚊帐顶。他无法相信一切是真实的，这是报纸的失实报道——这张报纸经常干这种事！ \n　　下午，同宿舍的人给他捎回一份电报。他从床上跳起来，手抖得象筛糠一般，打开了这份电报——他希望这是田晓霞打来的！他相信会有奇迹出现！ \n　　可是，电报竟是她父亲的——铜城大牙湾煤矿采五区孙少平请速来我处田福军。 \n　　孙少平两眼一阵发黑，把电报纸丢在床铺上。是的，晓霞的死是真实的。 \n　　可是，谁让她父亲给他拍电报呢？他根本不知道他和晓霞的事，他怎么知道他在这里？他为什么给他拍电报？速来？ \n　　孙少平神神魔魔，赤手空拳走出了宿舍。他很快赶到矿部前的小广场。每隔一小时发往铜城的公共车正在往上挤人。 \n　　他扑进车门，夹在人缝里，胸膛象压了一块大矸石。呼吸困难而急促，一个多钟头后，他在铜城下了汽车，上了当天开往省城的最后一趟火车。火车在茫茫大雨中驶过绿色的中部平原。 \n　　孙少平坐在靠窗户的座位上，也不看车窗外流逝的原野。他伏在茶几上，闭住眼睛。巨浪在心头一排排掀起，又猝然间落下，波浪中浮现出她美丽的脸庞。你不可能死，晓霞！你会活着的——这也许只是一场恶作剧。 \n　　你会发出那银铃般的笑声，不知会从什么地方突然出现在我面前，你那么鲜活而蓬勃的生命，怎么可能在这个世界上消失了呢？ \n　　不，你绝不会死！也许你已经在什么地方上岸了！是你让父亲给我打了这封电报。你或许只受了点伤，正躺在某个医院的病床上。你一定在等着我的到来……孙少平内心紧张地作各种设想。所有这些设想的前提都是晓霞还活着。是的，她怎么能死呢？她怎么会死呢？活着，是的，活着！亲爱的人，你只不过受了点伤，受了点惊吓，说不定我们还会明天从省城出发，赶到黄原去——因为后天，下午一点四十五分，我们还要在古�\n######################\nOutput:",
