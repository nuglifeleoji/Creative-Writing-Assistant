入考虑怎样实施这个计划。他越想越兴奋。弟弟文化程度高，说不定很快就能独立操持制砖机，不用再掏大工钱雇这位河南师傅了。弟兄俩一个照料砖厂，一个出去办“外交”，说不定还能把事干得更大哩！ \n　　孙少安鼻子口里喷着烟雾，在制砖机旁吸了一支旱烟卷后，就决定明天条自去黄原找少平。 \n　　少平会不会回来呢？这倒是个问题。 \n　　少安觉得，少平在吃苦方面和他一样，但另外一些方面和他有很大区别。弟弟脑子里常有一些怪想法。唉，也许是书念得太多了！ \n　　不过，他想他还是有些把握把弟弟叫回来的。他知道少平在外面也赚不了多少钱。当初他不愿意和他一块办砖厂，想到外面去闯荡一番——年轻人嘛，这也是可以理解的。他当年要不是家境无法维持，说不定也要出去闯荡一回哩。少平闯不出去，自然就会回头的。至于他迁出的户口，那好办，迁回来就是了；双水村不会把老根扎在家乡的人拒之门外的。 \n　　孙少安想好以后，决定明天早晨就搭班车走一趟黄原——这也将是他有生以来走得最远的地方。 \n　　晚上睡觉的时候，他就把走黄原的事对秀莲说了。当然他没说是去找少平。他对妻子撒谎说，有个熟人告诉他，黄原一个下马单位有台便宜处理的旧电机，他想去看看，行不行一两天就回来了。他现在不能对妻子说明他的打算。等少平回来了，他再和她商量这件事——反正到时生米做成熟饭，她同意不同意都无济于事了。 \n　　本来少安想先和父亲商量一下，但觉得也没必要。只要少平愿意回来和他一块干，父亲肯定不反对，还会很高兴的。他先要说服的只是少平。 \n　　第二天早晨，他换上了秀莲为他洗干净的“外交”制服，便在家门口下面的公路上，举起庄稼人僵硬的胳膊，挥手挡住了去黄原的班车。 \n　　他有点兴奋地踏进车厢，在车窗玻璃前向送行的妻子和儿子招招手，就被汽车拉着向远方的城市奔驰而去了……下午两点钟左右，孙少安到了黄原。 \n　　当他斜背着那个落满灰土的黑人造革皮包从汽车站走出来的时候，立刻被城市的景象弄得眼花缭乱，头晕目眩。他连东南西北也搞不清楚了。他抬头望了望城市上空的太阳，觉得和双水村的太阳位置都是相反的——太阳朝东边往下落了？我的天！这就是黄原？这么大的城？一条街恐怕比双水村到罐子村都远吧？ \n　　他现在得打问东关邮政所在什么地方，他走时就准备先找金俊海父子。少平是揽工的，谁知他在什么地方。找到俊海�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a character who is
