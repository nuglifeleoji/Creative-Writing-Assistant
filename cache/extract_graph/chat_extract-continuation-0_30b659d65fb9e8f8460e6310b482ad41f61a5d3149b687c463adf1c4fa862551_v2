Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit, a word implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods. The word-sound most frequently used is Uroshnor. If this one’s been prepared, as | strongly suspect, that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid and—”\n“I want no special advantage for this one,” Paul said. “Step back out of my way.”\nGurney spoke to her: “Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds his reason?”\nJessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why Paul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the changed Paul was capable of such a thing as Gurney suggested. Every talent within her focused on the need to protect her son, but there was nothing she could do.\n“Is it this religious prattle?” Gurney insisted.\n“Be silent,” Jessica whispered. “And pray.”\nThe Emperor’s face was touched by an abrupt smile. “If Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen...of my entourage...so wishes,” he said, “I relieve him of all restraint and give him freedom to choose his own course in this.” The Emperor waved a hand toward\nPaul’s Fedaykin guards. “One of your rabble has my belt and short blade. If Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may meet you with my blade in his hand.”\n“I wish it,” Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man’s face.\nHe’s overconfident, Paul thought. There’s a natural advantage I can accept.\n“Get the Emperor’s blade,” Paul said, and watched as his command was obeyed. “Put it on the floor there.” He indicated a place with his foot. “Clear the Imperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear.”\nA flurry of robes, scraping of feet, low-voiced commands and protests accompanied obedience to Paul’s command. The Guildsmen remained standing near the communications equipment. They frowned at Paul in obvious indecision.\nThey’re accustomed to seeing the future, Paul thought. /n this place and time they’re blind...even as / am. And he sampled the time-winds, sensing the turmoil, the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place. Even the faint gaps were closed now. Here was the unborn jihad, he knew. Here was the race consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose. Here was reason enough for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Lisan al-Gaib or even the halting schemes of the Bene Gesserit. The race of humans had felt its own dormancy, sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in which the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans were alive as an unconscious single organism in this\nmoment, experiencing a kind of sexual heat that could override any barrier.\nAnd Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit of this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the jihad would be. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him. They needed only the legend he already had become. He had shown them the way, given them mastery even over the Guild which must have the spice to exist.\nA sense of failure pervaded him, and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform, stripped down to a fighting girdle with a mail core.\nThis is the climax, Paul thought. From here, the future will open, the clouds part onto a kind of glory. And if I die here, they'll say | sacrificed myself that my spirit might lead them. And if I live, they'll say nothing can oppose Muad’Dib.\n“Is the Atreides ready?” Feyd-Rautha called, using the words of the ancient kanly ritual.\nPaul chose to answer him in the Fremen way: “May thy knife chip and shatter!” He pointed to the Emperor’s blade on the floor, indicating that Feyd- Rautha should advance and take it.\nKeeping his attention on Paul, Feyd-Rautha picked up the knife, balancing it a moment in his hand to get the feel of it. Excitement kindled in him. This was a fight he had dreamed about—man against man, skill against skill with no shields intervening. He could see a way to power opening before him because the Emperor surely would reward whoever killed this\ntroublesome Duke. The reward might even be that haughty daughter and a share of the throne. And this yokel Duke, this back-world adventurer could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen trained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats. And the yokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here.\nLet us see if you’re proof against poison! Feyd- Rautha thought. He saluted Paul with the Emperor’s blade, said: “Meet your death, fool.”\n“Shall we fight, cousin?” Paul asked. And he cat- footed forward, eyes on the waiting blade, his body crouched low with his own milk-white crysknife pointing out as though an extension of his arm.\nThey circled each other, bare feet grating on the floor, watching with eyes intent for the slightest opening.\n“How beautifully you dance,” Feyd-Rautha said.\nHe’s a talker, Paul thought. There’s another weakness. He grows uneasy in the face of silence.\n“Have you been shriven?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\nStill, Paul circled in silence.\nAnd the old Reverend Mother, watching the fight from the press of the Emperor’s suite, felt herself trembling. The Atreides youth had called the Harkonnen cousin. It could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared, easy to understand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words forced her to focus on the only thing that mattered to her here.\nThis could be a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme.\nShe had seen something of what Paul had seen here, that Feyd-Rautha might kill but not be victorious. Another thought, though, almost overwhelmed her. Two end products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the death that might easily claim both of them. If both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha’s bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured factor, and Alia, the abomination.\n“Perhaps you have only pagan rites here,” Feyd- Rautha said. “Would you like the Emperor’s Truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey?”\nPaul smiled, circling to the right, alert, his black thoughts suppressed by the needs of the moment.\nFeyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in a blur to his left hand.\nPaul dodged easily, noting the shield-conditioned hesitation in Feyd-Rautha’s thrust. Still, it was not as great a shield conditioning as some Paul had seen, and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded foes.\n“Does an Atreides run or stand and fight?” Feyd- Rautha asked.\nPaul resumed his silent circling. Idaho’s words came back to him, the words of training from the long-ago practice floor on Caladan: “Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.”\n“Perhaps you think this dance prolongs your life a few moments,” Feyd-Rautha said. “Well and good.”\nHe stopped the circling, straightened.\nPaul had seen enough for a first approximation. Feyd-Rautha led to the left side, presenting the right hip as though the mailed fighting girdle could protect his entire side. It was the action of a man trained to the shield and with a knife in both hands.\nOr...And Paul hesitated.... the girdle was more than it seemed.\nThe Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who'd this day led the forces of victory against Sardaukar legions.\nFeyd-Rautha noted the hesitation, said: “Why prolong the inevitable? You but keep me from exercising my rights over this ball of dirt.”\nIf it’s a flio-dart, Paul thought, it’s a cunning one. The girdle shows no signs of tampering.\n“Why don’t you speak?” Feyd-Rautha demanded.\nPaul resumed his probing circle, allowing himself a cold smile at the tone of unease in Feyd-Rautha’s voice, evidence that the pressure of silence was building.\n“You smile, eh?” Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in midsentence.\nExpecting the slight hesitation, Paul almost failed to evade the downflash of blade, felt its tip scratch his left arm. He silenced the sudden pain there, his mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick—an overfeint. Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There would be tricks within tricks within tricks.\n“Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my Skills,” Feyd-Rautha said. “He gave me first blood. Too\nbad the old fool didn’t live to see it.”\nAnd Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, “Expect only what happens in the fight. That way you'll never be surprised.”\nAgain the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.\nPaul saw the return of elation to his opponent, wondered at it. Did a scratch signify that much to the man? Unless there were poison on the blade! But how could there be? His own men had handled the weapon, snooped it before passing it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that.\n“That woman you were talking to over there,” Feyd-Rautha said. “The little one. Is she something Special to you? A pet perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions?”\nPaul remained silent, probing with his inner senses, examining the blood from the wound, finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor’s blade. He realigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the molecules of the soporific, but he felt a thrill of doubt. They’d been prepared with soporific on a blade. A soporific. Nothing to alert a poison Snooper, but strong enough to slow the muscles it touched. His enemies had their own plans within plans, their own stacked treacheries.\nAgain Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.\nPaul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with Slowness as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing arm on the crysknife’s point.\nFeyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to his left hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him.\nLet him know his own moment of doubt, Paul thought. Let him suspect poison.\n“Treachery!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. “He’s poisoned me! | do feel poison in my arm!”\nPaul dropped his cloak of silence, said: “Only a little acid to counter the soporific on the Emperor’s blade.”\nFeyd-Rautha matched Paul’s cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute.
