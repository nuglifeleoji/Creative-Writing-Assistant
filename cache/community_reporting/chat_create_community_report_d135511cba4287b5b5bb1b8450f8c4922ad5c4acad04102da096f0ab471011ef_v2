Their ability to carry equipment and assist climbers in traversing difficult terrain is vital for the success of climbing expeditions. The relationship between mules and the peak highlights the interdependence of climbers and their means of support. Without mules, many climbers would struggle to manage the physical demands of the ascent, especially in challenging conditions.
