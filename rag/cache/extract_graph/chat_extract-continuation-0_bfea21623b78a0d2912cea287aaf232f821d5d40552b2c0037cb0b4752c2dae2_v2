He lowered his hand but he continued to glower at Taraza.\n“My ambassador said we would share everything we know,” Taraza said. “You said you, too, would share. The messenger of God listens with the ears of the Prophet! What pours forth from the Abdl of the Tleilaxu?”\nWaff’s shoulders sagged.\nTaraza turned her back on him. It was an artful move but both she and the other Reverend Mothers present knew she did it now in perfect safety. Looking across the room at Odrade, Taraza allowed herself a smile that she knew Odrade would interpret correctly. Time for a bit of Bene Gesserit punishment!\n“The Tleilaxu desire an Atreides for breeding,” Taraza said. “I give you Darwi Odrade. More will be supplied.”\nWaff came to a decision. “You may know much about the Honored Matres,” he said, “but you—”\n“Whores!” Taraza whirled on him.\n“As you will. But there is a thing from them that your words reveal you do not know. | seal our bargain by telling you this. They can magnify the sensations of the orgasmic platform, transmitting this throughout a male body. They elicit the total sensual involvement of the male. Multiple orgasmic waves are created and may be continued by the ... the female for an extended period.”\n“Total involvement?” Taraza did not try to hide her astonishment.\nOdrade, too, listened with a sense of shock that she saw was Shared by her Sisters present, even the acolytes. Only Sheeana seemed not to understand.\n“I tell you, Mother Superior Taraza,” Waff said, a gloating smile on his face, “that we have duplicated this with our own people. Myself even! In my anger, | caused the Face Dancer who played the. . . female part to destroy itself. No one... I say, no one! may have such a hold on me!”\n“What hold?”\n“If it had been one of these . . . these whores, as you call them, | would have obeyed her without question in anything.” He shuddered. “I barely had the will to... to destroy .. .” He shook his head in bewilderment at the memory. “Anger saved me.”\nTaraza tried to swallow in a dry throat. “How...”\n“How is it done? Very well! But before | share this knowledge | warn you: If one of you ever tries to use this power over one of us, bloody slaughter will follow! We have prepared our Domel and all of our people to respond by killing all Reverend Mothers they can find at the slightest sign that you seek this power over us!”\n“None of us would do that, but not because of your threat. We are restrained by the knowledge that this would destroy us. Your bloody slaughter would not be necessary.”\n“Oh? Then why does it not destroy these... these whores?”\n“It does! And it destroys everyone they touch!”\n“It has not destroyed me!”\n“God protects you, my Abdl,” Taraza said. “As He protects all of the faithful.”\nConvinced, Waff glanced around the room and back to Taraza. “Let all know that | fulfill my bond in the land of the Prophet. This is the way of it, then...” He waved a hand to two of his Face Dancer guards. “We will demonstrate.”\nMuch later, alone in the penthouse room, Odrade wondered if it had been wise to let Sheeana see the whole performance. Well, why not? Sheeana already was committed to the Sisterhood. And it would have aroused Waff’s suspicions to send Sheeana away.\nThere had been obvious sensual arousal in Sheeana as she watched the Face Dancer performance. The Training Proctors would have to call in their male assistants earlier than usual for Sheeana. What would Sheeana do then? Would she try this new knowledge on the men? Inhibitions must be raised in Sheeana to prevent that! She must be taught the dangers to herself.\nThe Sisters and acolytes present had controlled themselves well, storing what they learned firmly in memory. Sheeana’s education must be built on that observation. Others mastered such internal forces.\nThe Face Dancer observers had remained inscrutable, but there had been things to see in Waff. He said he would destroy the two demonstrators but what would he do first? Would he succumb to temptation? What thoughts went through his mind as he watched the Face Dancer male squirm in mind-blanking ecstasy?\nIn a way, the demonstration reminded Odrade of the Rakian dance she had seen in the Great Square of Keen. In the short term, the dance had been deliberately unrhythmic but the progression created a long-term rhythm that repeated itself in some two hundred .. . steps. The dancers had stretched out their rhythm to a remarkable degree.\nAs had the Face Dancer demonstrators.\nSiaynog become a sexual grip on uncounted billions in the Scattering!\nOdrade thought about the dance, the long rhythm followed by chaotic violence. Siaynoq’s glorious focusing of religious energies had devolved into a different kind of exchange. She thought about Sheeana’s excited response to her glimpses of that dance in the Great Square. Odrade\nremembered asking Sheeana: “What did they share down there?”\n“The dancers, silly!”\nThat response had not been permissible. “I’ve warned you about that tone, Sheeana. Do you wish to learn immediately what a Reverend Mother can do to punish you?”\nThe words played themselves like ghost messages in Odrade’s mind as she looked at the gathering darkness outside the Dar-es-Balat penthouse. A great loneliness welled up in her. All the others had gone from this room.\nOnly the punished one remains!\nHow bright-eyed Sheeana had been in that room above the Great Square, her mind so full of questions. “Why do you always talk about hurting and punishment?”\n“You must learn discipline. How can you control others when you cannot control yourself?”\n“I don’t like that lesson.”\n“None of us does very much... until later when we’ve learned the value of it by experience.”\nAs intended, that response had festered long in Sheeana’s awareness. In the end, she had revealed all she knew about the dance.\n“Some of the dancers escape. Others go directly to Shaitan. The priests say they go to Shai-hulud.”\n“What of the ones who survive?”\n“When they recover, they must join a great dance in the desert. If Shaitan comes there, they die. If Shaitan does not come, they are rewarded.”\nOdrade had seen the pattern. Sheeana’s explanatory words had not been necessary beyond that point, even though the recital had been allowed to continue. How bitter Sheeana’s voice had been!\n“They get money, space in a bazaar, that kind of reward. The priests say they have proved that they are human.”\n“Are the ones who fail not human?”\nSheeana had remained silent for a long time in deep thought. The track was clear to Odrade, though: the Sisterhood’s test of humanity! Her own passage into the acceptable humanity of the Sisterhood had already been duplicated by Sheeana. How soft that passage seemed in comparison to the other pains!\nIn the dim light of the museum penthouse, Odrade held up her right hand, looking at it, remembering the agony box, and the gom jabbar poised at her neck ready to kill her if she flinched or cried out.\nSheeana had not cried out, either. But she had known the answer to Odrade’s question even before the agony box.\n“They are human but different.”\nOdrade spoke aloud in the empty room with its displays from the Tyrant’s no-chamber hoard.\n“What did you do to us, Leto? Are you only Shaitan talking to us? What would you force us to share now?”\nWas the fossil dance to become fossil sex?\n“Who are you talking to, Mother?”\nIt was Sheeana’s voice from the open doorway across the room. Her gray postulant’s robe was only a faint shape there, growing larger as she approached.\n“Mother Superior sent me for you,” Sheeana said as she came to a stop near Odrade.\n“| was talking to myself,” Odrade said. She looked at the strangely quiet girl, remembering the gut-wrenching excitement of that moment when the Fulcrum Question had been asked of Sheeana.\n“Do you wish to be a Reverend Mother?”\n“Why are you talking to yourself, Mother?” There was a load of concern in Sheeana’s voice. The Teaching Proctors would have their hands full removing those emotions.\n“I was remembering when | asked you if you wished to be a Reverend Mother,” Odrade said. “It prompted other thoughts.”\n“You said | must give myself to your direction in all things, holding back nothing, disobeying you in nothing.”\n“And you said: ‘Is that all?’”\n“| didn’t know very much, did |? | still don’t know very much.”\n“None of us does, child. Except that we’re all in the dance together. And Shaitan will certainly come if the least of us fails.”\nWhen strangers meet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training.\n—THE LADY JESSICA, FROM “WISDOM OF ARRAKIS”\nhe last greenish line of light fell out of the horizon before\nBurzmali gave the signal for them to move. It was dark by the time they reached the far side of Ysai and the perimeter road that was to lead them to Duncan. Clouds covered the sky, reflecting the city’s lights downward onto the shapes of the urban hovels through which their guides directed them.\nThese guides bothered Lucilla. They appeared out of side streets and from suddenly opened doorways to whisper new directions.\nToo many people knew about the fugitive pair and their intended rendezvous!\nShe had come to grips with her hatred but the residue was a profound distrust of every person they saw. Hiding this behind the mechanical attitudes of a playfem with her customer had become increasingly difficult.\nThere was slush on the pedestrian way beside the road, most of it scattered there by the passage of groundcars. Lucilla’s feet were cold before they had gone half a kilometer and she was forced to expend energy compensating for the added bloodflow in her extremities.\nBurzmali walked silently, his head down, apparently lost in his own worries. Lucilla was not fooled. He heard every sound around them, saw every approaching vehicle. He hustled them off the pathway each time a groundcar approached. The cars went swishing past on their\nsuspensors, the dirty slush flying from under their fanskirts and peppering the bushes along the road. Burzmali held her down beside him in the snow until he was sure the cars were out of sight and sound. Not that anyone riding in them could hear much except their own whirling passage.\nThey had been walking for two hours before Burzmali stopped and took stock of the way ahead. Their destination was a perimeter community that had been described to them as “completely safe.” Lucilla knew better. No place on Gammu was completely safe.\nYellow lights cast an undershot glow on the clouds ahead of them, marking the location of the community. Their slushy progress took them through a tunnel under the perimeter road and up a low hill planted to some sort of orchard. The limbs were stark in the dim light.\nLucilla glanced upward. The clouds\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ISLAMIYAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Islamiyat is a religious or cultural group mentioned in the context of the conversation between Waff and Taraza.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>Waff is a Tleilaxu representative involved in negotiations with the Bene Gesserit, demonstrating knowledge of Honored Matres' techniques.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior Taraza is a leader of the Bene Gesserit, engaging in high-stakes negotiations with the Tleilaxu.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, deeply involved in political and genetic manipulations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLIELAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and genetically advanced faction, known for their Face Dancers and dealings with the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Darwi Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, involved in the negotiations and training of Sheeana.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a feared group known for their sensual control over males, mentioned as a threat by Waff.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a postulant of the Bene Gesserit, undergoing training and showing curiosity about the Sisterhood's ways.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACE DANCERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Face Dancers are shape-shifting agents of the Tleilaxu, used in demonstrations and as guards.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEEN<|>GEO<|>Keen is a location mentioned in the context of a dance observed by Odrade in the Great Square.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAR-ES-BALAT<|>GEO<|>Dar-es-Balat is the location of a penthouse where Odrade reflects on recent events.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIAN DANCE<|>EVENT<|>The Rakian dance is a ritualistic performance observed by Odrade, with deep cultural and possibly religious significance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIYANOQ<|>EVENT<|>Siyanoq is a term referring to a sexual grip or control method used by the Honored Matres, as discussed by Waff.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is a planet where Lucilla and Burzmali are traveling, marked by urban hovels and perimeter roads.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILLA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a Bene Gesserit sister traveling with Burzmali, distrustful of their surroundings and guides.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURZMALI<|>PERSON<|>Burzmali is a companion to Lucilla, guiding her through the dangers of Gammu to reach Duncan.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>TLIELAXU<|>Waff is a representative of the Tleilaxu, involved in negotiations with the Bene Gesserit.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the Sisterhood in critical negotiations.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, involved in training Sheeana.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Sheeana is a postulant undergoing training to become a Reverend Mother.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Waff warns Taraza about the Honored Matres' techniques and their dangers.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>WAFF<|>Taraza negotiates with Waff, exchanging information and making agreements.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARWI ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade is responsible for Sheeana's training and education within the Bene Gesserit.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACE DANCERS<|>TLIELAXU<|>Face Dancers are agents of the Tleilaxu, used in demonstrations and as guards.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILLA<|>BURZMALI<|>Lucilla and Burzmali are traveling together to reach Duncan, navigating the dangers of Gammu.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BURZMALI<|>GAMMU<|>Burzmali guides Lucilla through the urban and perimeter areas of Gammu.<|>6\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
