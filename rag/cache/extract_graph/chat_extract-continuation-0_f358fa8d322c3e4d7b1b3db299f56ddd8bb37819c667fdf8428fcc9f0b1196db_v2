She watched and then left without comment. Teg did not know what Duncan was doing about the Imprinter but there was a feeling that the reawakened ghola played a delaying game with his seductress. She would not allow that to continue long, Teg knew, but it was out of his hands. Duncan no\nlonger was “too young” for the Imprinter. That young body carried a mature male mind with experiences from which to make his own decisions.\nDuncan and Teg had been on the floor with only one break all morning. Hunger pangs gnawed at Teg but he felt reluctant to halt the session. Duncan’s abilities had climbed to a new level today and he was still improving.\nTeg, seated in a fixed console’s cage seat, twisted the attack forces into a complex maneuver, striking from left, right, and above.\nThe Harkonnen armory had produced an abundance of these exotic weapons and training instruments, some of which Teg had known only from historical accounts. Duncan knew them all, apparently, and with an intimacy that Teg admired. Hunter-seekers geared to penetrate a force shield were part of the shadow system they used now.\n“They automatically slow down to go through the shield,” Duncan explained in his young-old voice. “Too fast a strike, of course, and the shield repels.”\n“Shields of that type have almost gone out of fashion,” Teg said. “A few societies maintain them as a kind of sport but otherwise...”\nDuncan executed a riposte of blurred speed that dropped three hunter-seekers to the floor damaged enough to require the no-globe’s maintenance services. He removed the cage and damped the system but left it idling while he came over to Teg, breathing deeply but easily. Looking past Teg, Duncan smiled and nodded. Teg whirled but there was only the flick of Lucilla’s gown as she left them.\n“It’s like a duel,” Duncan said. “She tries to thrust through my guard and | counterattack.”\n“Have a care,” Teg said. “That’s a full Reverend Mother.”\n“I’ve known a few of them in my time, Bashar.”\nOnce more, Teg found himself confounded. He had been warned that he would have to readjust to this different Duncan Idaho but he had not fully anticipated the constant\nmental demands of that readjustment. The look in Duncan’s eyes right now was disconcerting.\n“Our roles are changed a bit, Bashar,” Duncan said. He picked up a towel from the floor and mopped his face.\n“I’m no longer sure of what I can teach you,” Teg admitted. He wished, though, that Duncan would take his warning about Lucilla. Did Duncan imagine that the Reverend Mothers of those ancient days were identical with the women of today? Teg thought that highly unlikely. In the way of all other life, the Sisterhood evolved and changed.\nIt was obvious to Teg that Duncan had come to a decision about his place in Taraza’s machinations. Duncan was not merely biding his time. He was training his body to a personally chosen peak and he had made a judgment about the Bene Gesserit.\nHe has made that judgment on insufficient data, Teg thought.\nDuncan dropped the towel and looked at it for a moment. “Let me be the judge of what you can teach me, Bashar.” He turned and stared narrowly at Teg seated in the cage.\nTeg inhaled deeply. He smelled the faint ozone from all of this durable Harkonnen equipment ticking away in readiness for Duncan’s return to action. The ghola’s perspiration carried a bitter dominant.\nDuncan sneezed.\nTeg sniffed, recognizing the omnipresent dust of their activities. It could be more tasted than smelled at times. Alkaline. Over it all was the fragrance of the air scrubbers and oxy regenerators. There was a distinct floral aroma built into the system but Teg could not identify the flower. In the month of their occupation, the globe also had taken on human odors, slowly insinuated into the original composite —perspiration, cooking smells, the never-quite-suppressed acridity of waste reclamation. To Teg, these reminders of their presence were oddly offensive. And he found himself sniffing and listening for sounds of intrusion—something\nmore than the echoing passage of their own footsteps and the subdued metallic clashings from the kitchen area.\nDuncan’s voice intruded: “You’re an odd man, Bashar.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“There’s your resemblance to the Duke Leto. The facial identity is weird. He was a bit shorter than you but the identity .. .” He shook his head, thinking of the Bene Gesserit designs behind those genetic markers in Teg’s face —that hawk look, the crease lines and that inner thing, that certainty of moral superiority.\nHow moral and how superior?\nAccording to the records he had seen at the Keep (and Duncan was sure they had been placed there especially for him to discover) Teg’s reputation was an almost universal thing throughout human society of this age. At the Battle of Markon, it had been enough for the enemy to know that Teg was there opposite them in person. They sued for terms. Was that true?\nDuncan looked at Teg in the console cage and put this question to him.\n“Reputation can be a beautiful weapon,” Teg said. “It often spills less blood.”\n“At Arbelough, why did you go to the front with your troops?” Duncan asked.\nTeg showed surprise. “Where did you learn that?”\n“At the Keep. You might have been killed. What would that have served?”\nTeg reminded himself that this young flesh standing over him held unknown knowledge, which must guide Duncan’s quest for information. It was in that unknown area, Teg suspected, that Duncan was most valuable to the Sisterhood.\n“We took severe losses at Arbelough on the preceding two days,” Teg said. “I failed to make a correct assessment of the enemy’s fear and fanaticism.”\n“But the risk of...”\n“My presence at the front said to my own people: ‘I share your risks.’”\n“The Keep’s records said Arbelough had been perverted by Face Dancers. Patrin told me you vetoed your aides when they urged you to sweep the planet clean, sterilize it and—”\n“You were not there, Duncan.”\n“lam trying to be. So you spared your enemy against all advice.”\n“Except for the Face Dancers.”\n“But then you walked unarmed through the enemy ranks and before they had laid down their weapons.”\n“To assure them they would not be mistreated.”\n“That was very dangerous.”\n“Was it? Many of them came over to us for the final assault on Kroinin where we broke the anti-Sisterhood forces.”\nDuncan stared hard at Teg. Not only did this old Bashar resemble Duke Leto in appearance, but he also had that same Atreides charisma: a legendary figure even among his former enemies. Teg had said he was descended from Ghanima of the Atreides, but there had to be more in it than that. The ways of the Bene Gesserit breeding mastery awed him.\n“We will go back to the practice now,” Duncan said.\n“Don’t damage yourself.”\n“You forget, Bashar. | remember a body as young as this one and right here on Giedi Prime.”\n“Gammu!”\n“It was properly renamed but my body still recalls the Original. That is why they sent me here. | know it.”\nOf course he would know it, Teg thought.\nRestored by the brief respite, Teg introduced a new element in the attack and sent a sudden burn-line against Duncan’s left side.\nHow easily Duncan parried the attack!\nHe was using an oddly mixed variation on the five attitudes, each response seemingly invented before it was required.\n“Each attack is a feather floating on the infinite road,” Duncan said. His voice gave no hint of exertion. “As the feather approaches, it is diverted and removed.”\nAs he spoke, he parried the shifting attack and countered.\nTeg’s Mentat logic followed the movements into what he recognized as dangerous places. Dependencies and key logs!\nDuncan shifted over to attack, moving ahead of it, pacing his movements rather than responding. Teg was forced to his utmost abilities as the shadow forces burned and flickered across the floor. Duncan’s weaving figure in its mobile cage danced along the space between them. Not one of Teg’s hunter-seekers or burn-line counters touched the moving figure. Duncan was over them, under them, seeming totally unafraid of the real pain that this equipment could bring him.\nOnce more, Duncan increased the speed of his attack.\nA bolt of pain shot up Teg’s left arm from his hand on the controls to his shoulder.\nWith a sharp exclamation, Duncan shut down the equipment. “Sorry, Bashar. That was superb defense on your part but I’m afraid age defeated you.”\nOnce more, Duncan crossed the floor and stood over Teg.\n“A little pain to remind me of the pain | caused you,” Teg said. He rubbed his tingling arm.\n“Blame the heat of the moment,” Duncan said. “We have done enough for now.”\n“Not quite,” Teg said. “It is not enough to strengthen only your muscles.”\nAt Teg’s words, Duncan felt an alerting sensation throughout his body. He sensed the disorganized touch of that uncompleted thing that the reawakening had failed to\narouse. Something crouched within him, Duncan thought. It was like a coiled spring waiting for release.\n“What more would you do?” Duncan asked. His voice sounded hoarse.\n“Your survival is in the balance here,” Teg said. “All of this is being done to save you and get you to Rakis.”\n“For Bene Gesserit reasons, which you say you do not know!”\n“| don’t know them, Duncan.”\n“But you're a Mentat.”\n“Mentats require data to make projections.”\n“Do you think Lucilla knows?”\n“I’m not sure but let me warn you again about her. She has orders to get you to Rakis prepared for what you must do there.”\n“Must?” Duncan shook his head from side to side. “Am | not my own person with rights to make my own choices? What do you think you’ve reawakened here, a damned Face Dancer capable only of obeying orders?”\n“Are you telling me you will not go to Rakis?”\n“I’m telling you I will make my own decisions when | know what it is I’m to do. I’m not a hired assassin.”\n“You think | am, Duncan?”\n“I think you’re an honorable man, someone to be admired. Give me credit for having my own standards of duty and honor.”\n“You've been given another chance at life and—”\n“But you are not my father and Lucilla is not my mother. Imprinter? For what does she hope to prepare me?”\n“It may be that she does not know, Duncan. Like me, she may have only part of the design. Knowing how the Sisterhood works, that is highly likely.”\n“So the two of you just train me and deliver me to Arrakis. Here’s the package you ordered!”\n“This is a far different universe than the one where you were originally born,” Teg said. “As it was in your day, we\nstill have a Great Convention against atomics and the pseudo-atomics of lasgunshield interaction. We still say that sneak attacks are forbidden. There are pieces of paper scattered around to which we have put our names and we\n“But the no-ships have changed the basis for all of those treaties,” Duncan said. “I think | learned my\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a Bashar and a Mentat who is training Duncan Idaho.
