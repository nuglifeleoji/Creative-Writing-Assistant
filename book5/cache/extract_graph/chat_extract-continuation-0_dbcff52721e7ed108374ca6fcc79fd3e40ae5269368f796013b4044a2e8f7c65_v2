“来，拍完这卷。”\n　　“拍什么?”妻子惊诧地看着丈夫。以前，他是绝不允许其他人碰自己的相机，当然她和儿子对那玩意儿也没兴趣，在他们眼里，那是一个两万多元买来的乏味的老古董。\n　　“什么都行，随便拍。”汪淼把相机塞到妻子手中，一头钻进了暗室。\n　　“那，豆豆，我给你拍吧。”妻子把镜头对准了儿子。\n　　汪淼的脑海中突然浮现出幽灵般的数字像一条张开的绞索横在孩子面容前的幻象，他不由微微战栗了一下。“不，别拍儿子，随便拍别的什么吧。”\n　　快门“咔嚓”一声，妻子拍了第一张，然后叫道：“这怎么按不动了?”汪淼教妻子扳了一个手柄， “这样，每次都要倒卷。”然后钻进了暗室。\n　　“真麻烦。”身为医生的妻子不能理解，在千万级像素的数码相机已经普及的今天，还有人用这种过时的昂贵玩意儿，而且拍的还是黑白胶卷。\n　　胶卷冲出来后，对着晕暗的红灯，汪淼看到那幽灵倒计时仍在继续，在一张张随意拍出的混乱画面上，包括那几张扣着镜头盖拍的，清晰地显示出：1l87:19:06、1187:19:03、1187:l8:59、1187:18:56……\n　　妻子敲了两下暗室的门，告诉他拍完了。汪淼出门抓过相机，取胶�\n######################\nOutput:",
