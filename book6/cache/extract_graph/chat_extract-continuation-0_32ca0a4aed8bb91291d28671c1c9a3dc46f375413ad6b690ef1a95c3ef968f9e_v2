�惊奇地互相对视着，舰长问：“为什么？”\n　　丁仪的两手又乱舞起来，头发在舰队的光芒中发出白光，正像一上舰时就有人发现的那样，他真的很像爱因斯坦。“嗯……反正这样做也没什么大的损失，对吧……你们知道，我感觉不好。”\n　　丁仪说完这话就沉默了，两眼茫然地看着无限远方，最后伸手把飘浮的烟斗抓过来装到衣袋中，也不道别，笨拙地操纵着超导腰带向舱门飘去。军官们一直目送着他，当他的半个身体已经出门时，又慢慢地转过身来：“孩子们，你们知道我这些年都在于什么吗？在大学里教物理，还带博士生。”他遥望着外面的星河，脸上露出莫测的笑容，军官们发现，那笑容竟有些凄惨，“孩子们啊，我这两个世纪前的人了，现在居然还能在大学里教物理。”他说完，转身离去。\n　　舰长想对丁仪说什么，但见到他已经离去就没有说出来，神色严峻地思索着。\n　　军官们中有人看着水滴的影像。更多的人把目光集中在舰长身上。\n　　“舰长，你不会章他的话当真吧？”一名上校问。\n　　“他是个睿智的科学家，但毕竟是个古人，思考现代的事儿，总是……”有人附和道。\n　　“可是在他的领域里，人类一直没有进步，还停留在他的时代。”\n　　“他提到直觉，想想他的直觉都发现过些什么吧。”说话的军官语气里充满着敬畏。\n　　“而且……”西子脱口而出，但看看周围军衔比她高的一群人，把话又咽了回去。\n　　“少校，说吧。”舰长说。\n　　“而且像他说的，也没什么损失。”西子说。\n　　“可以从其他方面想想……一位副舰长说，”按目前的作战计划，如果捕获失败，水滴意外逃脱，舰队部署的追踪力量只有歼击机，但如果长途追踪就必须依靠恒星级战舰，舰队中应该有舰只做好这方面的准备，这应该看做计划的一个疏漏。“\n　　“向舰队打一个报告吧。”舰长说。\n　　舰队很快批复：在考察队出发后，“量子”号和在编队中与其相邻的“青铜时代”号两艘恒星级战舰进入深海状态。\n　　在对水滴进行捕获时，联合舰队的编队与目标的距离保持在一千公里，这是经过审慎计算后确定的。对于水滴可能的自毁方式有着多种猜测，所能设想的产生最大能量的自毁就是正反物质湮灭，水滴的质量小于十吨，那么在留有充分冗余量的情况下，所需考虑的最大的能量爆发就是由质量各为五吨的正反物质湮灭产生的。如果这样的湮灭发生在地球上，足以毁灭这颗行星表面的所有生命，但在太空中发生，其能量全部以光辐射的形式出现，对于拥有超强防\n######################\nOutput:",
