This instrument serves as a tool for instant death, wielded during the ritual to assess whether the subject possesses the necessary self-control and awareness to be considered truly human. The test itself is a critical rite, emphasizing the Bene Gesserit's focus on discipline, mental fortitude, and the distinction between humans and animals. While the descriptions vary slightly—one emphasizing the physical device (the needle) and the other the broader test—they are complementary, as the Gom Jabbar is both the instrument and the symbolic centerpiece of the Bene Gesserit's evaluation.
