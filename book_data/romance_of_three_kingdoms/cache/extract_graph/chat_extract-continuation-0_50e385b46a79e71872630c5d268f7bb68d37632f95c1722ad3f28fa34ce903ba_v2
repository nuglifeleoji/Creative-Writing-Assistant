�甫嵩、朱儁皆不肯与，赵忠等俱奏罢其官。帝又封赵忠等为车骑将军，张让等十三人皆封列侯。朝政愈坏，人民嗟怨。于是长沙贼区星作乱；渔阳张举、张纯反：举称天子，纯称大将军。表章雪片告急，十常侍皆藏匿不奏。\n\n    一日，帝在后园与十常侍饮宴，谏议大夫刘陶，径到帝前大恸。帝问其故。陶曰：“天下危在旦夕，陛下尚自与阉宦共饮耶！”帝曰：“国家承平，有何危急？”陶曰：“四方盗贼并起，侵掠州郡。其祸皆由十常侍卖官害民，欺君罔上。朝廷正人皆去，祸在目前矣！”十常侍皆免冠跪伏于帝前曰：“大臣不相容，臣等不能活矣！愿乞性命归田里，尽将家产以助军资。”言罢痛哭。帝怒谓陶曰：“汝家亦有近侍之人，何独不容朕耶？”呼武士推出斩之。刘陶大呼：“臣死不惜！可怜汉室天下，四百余年，到此一旦休矣！”\n\n    武士拥陶出，方欲行刑，一大臣喝住曰：“勿得下手，待我谏去。”众视之，乃司徒陈耽，径入宫中来谏帝曰：“刘谏议得何罪而受诛？”帝曰：“毁谤近臣，冒渎朕躬。”耽曰：“天下人民，欲食十常侍之肉，陛下敬之如父母，身无寸功，皆封列侯；况封谞等结连黄巾，欲为内乱：陛下今不自省，社稷立见崩摧矣！”帝曰：“封谞作乱，其事不明。十常侍中，岂无一二忠臣？”陈耽以头撞阶而谏。帝怒，命牵出，与刘陶皆下狱。是夜，十常侍即于狱中谋杀之；假帝诏以孙坚为长沙太守，讨区星，不五十日，报捷，江夏平，诏封坚为乌程侯。\n\n    封刘虞为幽州牧，领兵往渔阳征张举、张纯。代州刘恢以书荐玄德见虞。虞大喜，令玄德为都尉，引兵直抵贼巢，与贼大战数日，挫动锐气。张纯专一凶暴，士卒心变，帐下头目刺杀张纯，将头纳献，率众来降。张举见势败，亦自缢死。渔阳尽平。刘虞表奏刘备大功，朝廷赦免鞭督邮之罪，除下密丞，迁高堂尉。公孙瓒又表陈玄德前功，荐为别部司马，守平原县令。玄德在平原，颇有钱粮军马，重整旧日气象。刘虞平寇有功，封太尉。中平六年夏四月，灵帝病笃，召大将军何进入宫，商议后事。那何进起身屠家；因妹入宫为贵人，生皇子辩，遂立为皇后。进由是得权重任。帝又宠幸王美人，生皇\n######################\nOutput:",
