The planet is also a hub for smuggling operations, further complicating its political and economic significance. Historically, Buzzell was the site of an incident involving the abduction of Reverend Mothers by strangers, likely Honored Matres, and it is rumored to be a location where an old witch was once held before being brought to Dama.  \n\nDespite its perilous status and the ongoing struggle for dominance between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, Buzzell remains a critical stronghold.
