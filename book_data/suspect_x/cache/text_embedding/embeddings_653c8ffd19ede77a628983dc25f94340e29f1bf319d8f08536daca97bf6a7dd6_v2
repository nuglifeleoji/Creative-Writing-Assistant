forget,” and whipped his own flesh with it.\nShe crossed to his side, stared past him at an angle. The growing heat of the day had begun pulling the north wind out of these protected latitudes. The wind painted a false sky full of ochre plumes and sheets of crystal, strange designs in rushing gold and red. High and cold, the wind broke against the Shield Wall with fountains of dust.\nPaul felt Chani’s warmth beside him. Momentarily, he lowered a curtain of forgetfulness across his vision. He might just be standing here with his eyes closed. Time refused to stand still for him, though. He inhaled darkness— starless, tearless. His affliction dissolved substance until all that remained was astonishment at the way sounds condensed his universe. Everything around him leaned on his lonely sense of hearing, falling back only when he touched objects: the drapery, Chani’s hand. . . He caught himself listening for Chani’s breaths.\nWhere was the insecurity of things that were only probable? he asked himself. His mind carried such a burden\nof mutilated memories. For every instant of reality there existed countless projections, things fated never to be. An invisible self within him remembered the false pasts, their burden threatening at times to overwhelm the present.\nChani leaned against his arm.\nHe felt his body through her touch: dead flesh carried by time eddies. He reeked of memories that had glimpsed eternity. To see eternity was to be exposed to eternity’s whims, oppressed by endless dimensions. The oracle’s false immortality demanded retribution: Past and Future became simultaneous.\nOnce more, the vision arose from its black pit, locked onto him. It was his eyes. It moved his muscles. It guided him into the next moment, the next hour, the next day... until he felt himself to be always there!\n“It’s time we were going,” Chani said. “The Council...”\n“Alia will be there to stand in my place.”\n“Does she know what to do?”\n“She knows.”\nAlia’s day began with a guard squadron swarming into the parade yard below her quarters. She stared down at a scene of frantic confusion, clamorous and intimidating babble. The scene became intelligible only when she recognized the prisoner they’d brought: Korba, the Panegyrist.\nShe made her morning toilet, moving occasionally to the window, keeping watch on the progress of impatience down there. Her gaze kept straying to Korba. She tried to remember him as the rough and bearded commander of the third wave in the battle of Arrakeen. It was impossible. Korba had become an immaculate fop dressed now ina Parato silk robe of exquisite cut. It lay open to the waist, revealing a beautifully laundered ruff and embroidered undercoat set with green gems. A purple belt gathered the waist. The sleeves poking through the robe’s armhole slits had been tailored into rivulet ridges of dark green and black velvet.\nA few Naibs had come out to observe the treatment accorded a fellow Fremen. They’d brought on the clamor, exciting Korba to protest his innocence. Alia moved her gaze across the Fremen faces, trying to recapture memories of the original men. The present blotted out the past. They’d all become hedonists, samplers of pleasures most men couldn’t even imagine.\nTheir uneasy glances, she saw, strayed often to the doorway into the chamber where they would meet. They were thinking of Muad’Dib’s blind-sight, a new manifestation of mysterious powers. By their law, a blind man should be abandoned in the desert, his water given up to Shai-hulud. But eyeless Muad’Dib saw them. They disliked buildings, too, and felt vulnerable in space built above the ground. Give them a proper cave cut from rock, then they could relax—but not here, not with this new Muad’Dib waiting inside.\nAs she turned to go down to the meeting, she saw the letter where she'd left it on a table by the door: the latest message from their mother. Despite the special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul’s birth, the Lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj.\n“No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history,” she’d written, “but | cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion.”\nAlia touched the letter, experienced an odd sensation of mutual contact. This paper had been in her mother’s hands. Such an archaic device, the letter—but personal in a way no recording could achieve. Written in the Atreides battle tongue, it represented an almost invulnerable privacy of communication.\nThinking of her mother afflicted Alia with the usual inward blurring. The spice change that had mixed the psyches of mother and daughter forced her at times to think of Paul as a son to whom she had given birth. The capsule-complex of\noneness could present her own father as a lover. Ghost shadows cavorted in her mind, people of possibility.\nAlia reviewed the letter as she walked down the ramp to the antechamber where her guard amazons waited.\n“You produce a deadly paradox,” Jessica had written. “Government cannot be religious and self-assertive at the same time. Religious experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress. And you cannot govern without laws. Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience, replace even the religion by which you think to govern. Sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality. Government, on the other hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions and contentions. | see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replaces morality.”\nThe smell of spice-coffee greeted Alia in the antechamber. Four guard amazons in green watch-robes came to attention as she entered. They fell into step behind her, striding firmly in the bravado of their youth, eyes alert for trouble. They had zealot faces untouched by awe. They radiated that special Fremen quality of violence: they could kill casually with no sense of guilt.\nIn this, | am different, Alia thought. The Atreides name has enough dirt on it without that.\nWord preceded her. A waiting page darted off as she entered the lower hall, running to summon the full guard detail. The hall stretched out windowless and gloomy, illuminated only by a few subdued glowglobes. Abruptly, the doors to the parade yard opened wide at the far end to admit a glaring shaft of daylight. The guard with Korba in their midst wavered into view from the outside with the light behind them.\n“Where is Stilgar?” Alia demanded.\n“Already inside,” one of her amazons said.\nAlia led the way into the chamber. It was one of the Keep’s more pretentious meeting places. A high balcony with rows of soft seats occupied one side. Across from the balcony, orange draperies had been pulled back from tall windows. Bright sunlight poured through from an open space with a garden and a fountain. At the near end of the chamber on her right stood a dais with a single massive chair.\nMoving to the chair, Alia glanced back and up, saw the gallery filled with Naibs.\nHousehold guardsmen packed the open space beneath the gallery, Stilgar moving among them with a quiet word here, a command there. He gave no sign that he’d seen Alia enter.\nKorba was brought in, seated at a low table with cushions beside it on the chamber floor below the dais. Despite his finery, the Panegyrist gave the appearance now of a Surly, sleepy old man huddled up in his robes as against the outer cold. Two guardsmen took up positions behind him.\nStilgar approached the dais as Alia seated herself.\n“Where is Muad’Dib?” he asked.\n“My brother has delegated me to preside as Reverend Mother,” Alia said.\nHearing this, the Naibs in the gallery began raising their voices in protest.\n“Silence!” Alia commanded. In the abrupt quiet, she said: “Is it not Fremen law that a Reverend Mother presides when life and death are at issue?”\nAs the gravity of her statement penetrated, stillness came over the Naibs, but Alia marked angry stares across the rows of faces. She named them in her mind for discussion in Council—Hobars, Rajifiri, Tasmin, Saajid, Umbu, Legg ... The names carried pieces of Dune in them: Umbu Sietch, Tasmin Sink, Hobars Gap...\nShe turned her attention to Korba.\nObserving her attention, Korba lifted his chin, said: “1 protest my innocence.”\n“Stilgar, read the charges,” Alia said.\nStilgar produced a brown spicepaper scroll, stepped forward. He began reading, a solemn flourish in his voice as though to hidden rhythms. He gave the words an incisive quality, clear and full of probity:\n“that you did conspire with traitors to accomplish the destruction of our Lord and Emperor; that you did meet in vile secrecy with diverse enemies of the realm; that you...”\nKorba kept shaking his head with a look of pained anger.\nAlia listened broodingly, chin planted on her left fist, head cocked to that side, the other arm extended along the chair arm. Bits of the formal procedure began dropping out of her awareness, screened by her own feelings of disquiet.\n“venerable tradition ... support of the legions and all Fremen everywhere ... violence met with violence according to the Law... majesty of the Imperial Person... forfeit all rights to...”\nIt was nonsense, she thought. Nonsense! All of it— nonsense ... nonsense ... nonsense...\nStilgar finished: “Thus the issue is brought to judgment.”\nIn the immediate silence, Korba rocked forward, hands gripping his knees, veined neck stretched as though he were preparing to leap. His tongue flicked between his teeth as he spoke.\n“Not by word or deed have | been traitor to my Fremen vows! | demand to confront my accuser!”\nA simple enough protest, Alia thought.\nAnd she saw that it had produced a considerable effect on the Naibs. They knew Korba. He was one of them. To become a Naib, he’d proved his Fremen courage and caution. Not brilliant, Korba, but reliable. Not one to lead a Jihad, perhaps, but a good choice as supply officer. Not a\ncrusader, but one who cherished the old Fremen virtues: The Tribe is paramount.\nOtheym’s bitter words as Paul had recited them swept through Alia’s mind. She scanned the gallery. Any of those men might see himself in Korba’s place—some for good reason. But an innocent Naib was as dangerous as a guilty one here.\nKorba felt it, too. “Who accuses me?” he demanded. “l have a Fremen right to confront my accuser.”\n“Perhaps you accuse yourself,” Alia said.\nBefore he could mask it, mystical terror lay briefly on Korba’s face. It was there for anyone to read: With her powers, Alia had but to accuse him herself, saying she brought the evidence from the shadow region, the alam al- mythal.\n“Our enemies have Fremen allies,” Alia pressed. “Water traps have been destroyed, qanats blasted, plantings poisoned and storage basins plundered...”\n“And now—they’ve stolen a worm from the desert, taken it to another world!”\nThe voice of this intrusion was known to all of the m— Muad’Dib. Paul came through the doorway from the hall, pressed through", " Korba’s place—some for good reason. But an innocent Naib was as dangerous as a guilty one here.\nKorba felt it, too. “Who accuses me?” he demanded. “l have a Fremen right to confront my accuser.”\n“Perhaps you accuse yourself,” Alia said.\nBefore he could mask it, mystical terror lay briefly on Korba’s face.

Paul came through the doorway from the hall, pressed through the guard ranks and crossed to Alia’s side. Chani, accompanying him, remained on the sidelines.\n“M’Lord,” Stilgar said, refusing to look at Paul’s face.\nPaul aimed his empty sockets at the gallery, then down to Korba. “What, Korba—no words of praise?”\nMuttering could be heard in the gallery. It grew louder, isolated words and phrases audible: “...law for the blind... Fremen way ...in the desert . .. who breaks...”\n“Who says I’m blind?” Paul demanded. He faced the gallery. “You, Rajifiri? | see you’re wearing gold today, and that blue shirt beneath it which still has dust on it from the streets. You always were untidy.”\nRajifiri made a warding gesture, three fingers against evil.\n“Point those fingers at yourself!” Paul shouted. “We know where the evil is!” He turned back to Korba. “There’s guilt on your face, Korba.”\n“Not my guilt! | may’ve associated with the guilty, but no...” He broke off, shot a frightened look at the gallery.\nTaking her cue from Paul, Alia arose, stepped down to the floor of the chamber, advanced to the edge of Korba’s table. From a range of less than a meter, she stared down at him, silent and intimidating.\nKorba cowered under the burden of eyes. He fidgeted, shot anxious glances at the gallery.\n“Whose eyes do you seek up there?” Paul asked.\n“You cannot see!” Korba blurted.\nPaul put down a momentary feeling of pity for Korba. The man lay trapped in the vision’s snare as securely as any of those present. He played a part, no more.\n“| don’t need eyes to see you,” Paul said. And he began describing Korba, every movement, every twitch, every alarmed and pleading look at the gallery.\nDesperation grew in Korba.\nWatching him, Alia saw he might break any second. Someone in the gallery must realize how near he was to breaking, she thought. Who? She studied the faces of the Naibs, noting small betrayals in the masked faces... angers, fears, uncertainties .. . guilts.\nPaul fell silent.\nKorba mustered a pitiful air of pomposity to plead: “Who accuses me?”\n“Otheym accuses you,” Alia said.\n“But Otheym’s dead!” Korba protested.\n“How did you know that?” Paul asked. “Through your spy system? Oh, yes! We know about your spies and couriers. We know who brought the stone burner here from Tarahell.”\n“It was for the defense of the Qizarate!” Korba blurted.\n“Is that how it got into traitorous hands?” Paul asked.\n“It was stolen and we .. .” Korba fell silent, swallowed. His gaze darted left and right. “Everyone knows I’ve been the voice of love for Muad’Dib.” He stared at the gallery. “How can a dead man accuse a Fremen?”\n“Otheym’s voice isn’t dead,” Alia said. She stopped as Paul touched her arm.\n“Otheym sent us his voice,” Paul said. “It gives the names, the acts of treachery, the meeting places and the times. Do you miss certain faces in the Council of Naibs, Korba? Where are Merkur and Fash? Keke the Lame isn’t with us today. And Takim, where is he?”\nKorba shook his head from side to side.\n“They’ve fled Arrakis with the stolen worm,” Paul said. “Even if | freed you now, Korba, Shai-hulud would have your water for your part in this. Why don’t | free you, Korba? Think of all those men whose eyes were taken, the men who cannot see as | see. They have families and friends, Korba. Where could you hide from them?”\n“It was an accident,” Korba pleaded. “Anyway, they’re getting Tleilaxu...” Again, he subsided.\n“Who knows what bondage goes with metal eyes?” Paul asked.\nThe Naibs in their gallery began exchanging whispered comments, speaking behind raised hands. They gazed coldly at Korba now.\n“Defense of the Qizarate,” Paul murmured, returning to Korba’s plea. “A device which either destroys a planet or produces J-rays to blind those too near it. Which effect, Korba, did you conceive as a defense? Does the Qizarate rely on stopping the eyes of all observers?”\n“It was a Curiosity, m’Lord,” Korba pleaded. “We knew the Old Law said that only Families could possess atomics, but the Qizarate obeyed... obeyed...”\n“Obeyed you,” Paul said. “A curiosity, indeed.”\n“Even if it’s only the voice of my accuser, you must face me with it!” Korba said. “A Fremen has rights.”\n“He speaks truth, Sire,” Stilgar said.\nAlia glanced sharply at Stilgar.\n“The law is the law,” Stilgar said, sensing Alia’s protest. He began quoting Fremen Law, interspersing his own comments on how the Law pertained.\nAlia experienced the odd sensation she was hearing Stilgar’s words before he spoke them. How could he be this credulous? Stilgar had never appeared more official and conservative, more intent on adhering to the Dune Code. His chin was outthrust, aggressive. His mouth chopped. Was there really nothing in him but this outrageous pomposity?\n“Korba is a Fremen and must be judged by Fremen Law,” Stilgar concluded.\nAlia turned away, looked out at the day shadows dropping down the wall across from the garden. She felt drained by frustration. They’d dragged this thing along well into midmorning. Now, what? Korba had relaxed. The Panegyrist’s manner said he’d suffered an unjust attack, that everything he’d done had been for love of Muad’Dib. She glanced at Korba, surprised a look of sly self-importance Sliding across his face.\nHe might almost have received a message, she thought. He acted the part of a man who'd heard friends shout: “Hold fast! Help is on its way!”\nFor an instant, they’d held this thing in their hands—the information out of the dwarf, the clues that others were in the plot, the names of informants. But the critical moment had flown. Stilgar? Surely not Stilgar. She turned, stared at the old Fremen.\nStilgar met her gaze without flinching.\n“Thank you, Stil,” Paul said, “for reminding us of the Law.”\nStilgar inclined his head. He moved close, shaped silent words in a way he knew both Paul and Alia could read. /’// wring him dry and then take care of the matter.\nPaul nodded, signaled the guardsmen behind Korba.\n“Remove Korba to a maximum security cell,” Paul said. “No visitors except counsel. As counsel, | appoint Stilgar.”\n“Let me choose my own counsel!” Korba shouted.\nPaul whirled. “You deny the fairness and judgment of Stilgar?”\n“Oh, no, m’Lord, but...”\n“Take him away!” Paul barked.\nThe guardsmen lifted Korba off the cushions, herded him out.\nWith new mutterings, the Naibs began quitting their gallery. Attendants came from beneath the gallery, crossed to the windows and drew the orange draperies. Orange gloom took over the chamber.\n“Paul,” Alia said.\n“When we precipitate violence,” Paul said, “it’ll be when we have full control of it. Thank you, Stil; you played your part well. Alia, I’m certain, has identified the Naibs who were with him. They couldn’t help giving themselves away.”\n“You cooked this up between you?” Alia demanded.\n“Had | ordered Korba slain out of hand, the Naibs would have understood,” Paul said. “But this formal procedure without strict adherence to Fremen Law—they felt their own rights threatened. Which Naibs were with him, Alia?”\n“Rajifiri for certain,” she said, voice low. “And Saajid, but...”\n“Give Stilgar the complete list,” Paul said.\nAlia swallowed in a dry throat, sharing the general fear of Paul in this moment. She knew how he moved among them without eyes, but the delicacy of it daunted her. To see their forms in the air of his vision! She sensed her person shimmering for him in a sidereal time whose accord with reality depended entirely on his words and actions. He held them all in the palm of his vision!\n“It’s past time for your morning audience, Sire,” Stilgar said. “Many people—curious ... afraid...”\n“Are you afraid, Stil?”\nIt was barely a whisper: “Yes.”\n“You're my friend and have nothing to fear from me,” Paul said.\nStilgar swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Alia, take the morning audience,” Paul said. “Stilgar, give the signal.”\nStilgar obeyed.\nA flurry of movement erupted at the great doors. A crowd was pressed back from the shadowy room to permit entrance of officials. Many things began happening all at once: the household guard elbowing and shoving back the press of Supplicants, garishly robed Pleaders trying to break through, shouts, curses. Pleaders waved the papers of their calling. The Clerk of the Assemblage strode ahead of them through the opening cleared by the guard. He carried the List of Preferences, those who'd be permitted to approach the Throne. The Clerk, a wiry Fremen named Tecrube, carried himself with weary cynicism, flaunting his shaven head, clumped whiskers.\nAlia moved to intercept him, giving Paul time to slip away with Chani through the private passage behind the dais. She experienced a momentary distrust of Tecrube at the prying curiosity in the stare he sent after Paul.\n“I speak for my brother today,” she said. “Have the Supplicants approach one at a time.”\n“Yes, m’Lady.” He turned to arrange his throng.\n“I can remember a time when you wouldn’t have mistaken your brother’s purpose here,” Stilgar said.\n“I was distracted,” she said. “There’s been a dramatic change in you, Stil. What is it?”\nStilgar drew himself up, shocked. One changed, of course. But dramatically? This was a particular view of himself that he’d never encountered. Drama was a questionable thing. Imported entertainers of dubious loyalty and more dubious virtue were", "ube, carried himself with weary cynicism, flaunting his shaven head, clumped whiskers.\nAlia moved to intercept him, giving Paul time to slip away with Chani through the private passage behind the dais.

Imported entertainers of dubious loyalty and more dubious virtue were dramatic. Enemies of the Empire employed drama in their attempts to sway the fickle populace. Korba\nhad slipped away from Fremen virtues to employ drama for the Qizarate. And he’d die for that.\n“You're being perverse,” Stilgar said. “Do you distrust me?”\nThe distress in his voice softened her expression, but not her tone. “You know | don’t distrust you. I’ve always agreed with my brother that once matters were in Stilgar’s hands we could safely forget them.”\n“Then why do you Say I’ve... changed?”\n“You're preparing to disobey my brother,” she said. “I can read it in you. | only hope it doesn’t destroy you both.”\nThe first of the Pleaders and Supplicants were approaching now. She turned away before Stilgar could respond. His face, though, was filled with the things she’d sensed in her mother’s letter—the replacement of morality and conscience with law.\n“You produce a deadly paradox.”\nTibana was an apologist for Socratic Christianity, probably a native of IV Anbus who lived between the eighth and ninth centuries before Corrino, likely in the second reign of Dalamak. Of his writings, only a portion survives from which this fragment is taken: “The hearts of all men dwell in the same wilderness.”\n—FROM THE DUNEBUK OF IRULAN\nee are Bijaz,” the ghola said, entering the small chamber where the dwarf was held under guard. “l am called Hayt.”\nA strong contingent of the household guard had come in with the ghola to take over the evening watch. Sand carried by the sunset wind had stung their cheeks while they crossed the outer yard, made them blink and hurry. They could be heard in the passage outside now exchanging the banter and ritual of their tasks.\n“You are not Hayt,” the dwarf said. “You are Duncan Idaho. | was there when they put your dead flesh into the tank and | was there when they removed it, alive and ready for training.”\nThe ghola swallowed in a throat suddenly dry. The bright glowglobes of the chamber lost their yellowness in the room’s green hangings. The light showed beads of perspiration on the dwarf’s forehead. Bijaz seemed a creature of odd integrity, as though the purpose fashioned into him by the Tleilaxu were projected out through his skin. There was power beneath the dwarf’s mask of cowardice and frivolity.\n“Muad’Dib has charged me to question you to determine what it is the Tleilaxu intend you to do here,” Hayt said.\n“Tleilaxu, Tleilaxu,” the dwarf sang. “I am the Tleilaxu, you dolt! For that matter, so are you.”\nHayt stared at the dwarf. Bijaz radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observer think of ancient idols.\n“You hear that guard outside?” Hayt asked. “If | gave them the order, they’d strangle you.”\n“Hai! Hai!” Bijaz cried. “What a callous lout you’ve become. And you said you came seeking truth.”\nHayt found he didn’t like the look of secret repose beneath the dwarf’s expression. “Perhaps | only seek the future,” he said.\n“Well spoken,” Bijaz said. “Now we know each other. When two thieves meet they need no introduction.”\n“So we're thieves,” Hayt said. “What do we steal?”\n“Not thieves, but dice,” Bijaz said. “And you came here to read my spots. I, in turn, read yours. And lo! You have two faces!”\n“Did you really see me go into the Tleilaxu tanks?” Hayt asked, fighting an odd reluctance to ask that question.\n“Did I not say it?” Bijaz demanded. The dwarf bounced to his feet. “We had a terrific struggle with you. The flesh did not want to come back.”\nHayt felt suddenly that he existed in a dream controlled by some other mind, and that he might momentarily forget this to become lost in the convolutions of that mind.\nBijaz tipped his head slyly to one side, walked all around the ghola, staring up at him. “Excitement kindles old patterns in you,” Bijaz said. “You are the pursuer who doesn’t want to find what he pursues.”\n“You're a weapon aimed at Muad’Dib,” Hayt said, swiveling to follow the dwarf. “What is it you’re to do?”\n“Nothing!” Bijaz said, stopping. “I give you a common answer to a common question.”\n“Then you were aimed at Alia,” Hayt said. “Is she your target?”\n“They call her Hawt, the Fish Monster, on the out-worlds, Bijaz said. “How is it | hear your blood boiling when you speak of her?”\n”\n“So they call her Hawt,” the ghola said, studying Bijaz for any clue to his purpose. The dwarf made such odd responses.\n“She is the virgin-harlot,” Bijaz said. “She is vulgar, witty, knowledgeable to a depth that terrifies, cruel when she is most kind, unthinking while she thinks, and when she seeks to build she is as destructive as a coriolis storm.”\n“So you came here to speak out against Alia,” Hayt said.\n“Against her?” Bijaz sank to a cushion against the wall. “1 came here to be captured by the magnetism of her physical beauty.” He grinned, a saurian expression in the big- featured face.\n“To attack Alia is to attack her brother,” Hayt said.\n“That is so clear it is difficult to see,” Bijaz said. “In truth, Emperor and sister are one person back to back, one being half male and half female.”\n“That is a thing we’ve heard said by the Fremen of the deep desert,” Hayt said. “And those are the ones who've revived the blood sacrifice to Shai-hulud. How is it you repeat their nonsense?”\n“You dare say nonsense?” Bijaz demanded. “You, who are both man and mask? Ahh, but the dice cannot read their own spots. | forget this. And you are doubly confused because you serve the Atreides double-being. Your senses are not as close to the answer as your mind is.”\n“Do you preach that false ritual about Muad’Dib to your guards?” Hayt asked, his voice low. He felt his mind being tangled by the dwarf’s words.\n“They preach to me!” Bijaz said. “And they pray. Why should they not? All of us should pray. Do we not live in the shadow of the most dangerous creation the universe has ever seen?”\n“Dangerous creation...”\n“Their own mother refuses to live on the same planet with them!”\n“Why don’t you answer me straight out?” Hayt demanded. “You know we have other ways of questioning you. We’ll get our answers... one way or another.”\n“But | have answered you! Have | not said the myth is real? Am | the wind that carries death in its belly? No! | am words! Such words as the lightning which strikes from the sand in a dark sky. | have said: ‘Blow out the lamp! Day is here!’ And you keep saying: ‘Give me a lamp so | can find the day.’”\n“You play a dangerous game with me,” Hayt said. “Did you think | could not understand these Zensunni ideas? You leave tracks as clear as those of a bird in mud.”\nBijaz began to giggle.\n“Why do you laugh?” Hayt demanded.\n“Because | have teeth and wish | had not,” Bijaz managed between giggles. “Having no teeth, | could not gnash them.”\n“And now | know your target,” Hayt said. “You were aimed at me.”\n“And I've hit it right on!” Bijaz said. “You made such a big target, how could | miss?” He nodded as though to himself. “Now I will sing to you.” He began to hum, a keening, whining monotonous theme, repeated over and over.\nHayt stiffened, experiencing odd pains that played up and down his spine. He stared at the face of the dwarf, seeing youthful eyes in an old face. The eyes were the center of a network of knobby white lines which ran to the hollows below his temples. Such a large head! Every feature focused on the pursed-up mouth from which that monotonous noise issued. The sound made Hayt think of ancient rituals, folk memories, old words and customs, half-forgotten meanings in lost mutterings. Something vital was happening here—a bloody play of ideas across Time. Elder ideas lay tangled in the dwarf’s singing. It was like a blazing light in the distance, coming nearer and nearer, illuminating life across a span of centuries.\n“What are you doing to me?” Hayt gasped.\n“You are the instrument | was taught to play,” Bijaz said. “I am playing you. Let me tell you the names of the other traitors among the Naibs. They are Bikouros and Cahueit. There is Djedida, who was secretary to Korba. There is Abumojandis, the aide to Bannerjee. Even now, one of them could be sinking a blade into your Muad’Dib.”\nHayt shook his head from side to side. He found it too difficult to talk.\n“We are like brothers,” Bijaz said, interrupting his monotonous hum once more. “We grew in the same tank: | first and then you.”\nHayt’s metal eyes inflicted him with a sudden burning pain. Flickering red haze surrounded everything he saw. He felt he had been cut away from every immediate sense except the pain, and he experienced his surroundings through a thin separation like windblown gauze. All had become accident, the chance involvement of inanimate matter. His own will was no more than a subtle, shifting thing. It lived without breath and was intelligible only as an inward illumination.\nWith a clarity born of desperation, he broke through the gauze curtain with the lonely sense of sight. His attention focused like a blazing light under Bijaz. Hayt felt that his eyes cut through layers of the dwarf, seeing the little man as a hired intellect, and beneath that, a creature imprisoned by hungers and cravings which lay huddled in the eyes— layer after layer, until finally, there was only an entity- aspect being manipulated by symbols.\n“We are upon a battleground,” Bijaz said. “You may speak of it.”\nHis voice freed by the command, Hayt said: “You cannot force me to slay Muad’Dib.”\n“I have heard the Bene Gesserit say,” Bijaz said, “that there is nothing firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_653c8ffd19ede77a628983dc25f94340e29f1bf319d8f08536daca97bf6a7dd6_v2"}
