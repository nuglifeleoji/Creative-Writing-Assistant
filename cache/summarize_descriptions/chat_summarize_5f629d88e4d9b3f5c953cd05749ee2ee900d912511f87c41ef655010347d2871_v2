The Landsraad serves as a political body representing the noble houses, while CHOAM (Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles) functions as the primary economic entity overseeing trade and commerce across the universe.  \n\nThese organizations are frequently aligned in their interests, collaborating to uphold the stability and balance of power within the Imperium. Their partnership ensures that political decisions and economic policies are mutually reinforcing, preventing disruptions that could threaten the established order. By working together, the Landsraad and CHOAM help maintain the intricate system of governance that defines the Imperium, blending aristocratic influence with economic oversight to sustain its structure.  \n\nWhile their functions differ—the Landsraad focusing on legislative and diplomatic matters, and CHOAM on trade and resource distribution—their cooperation underscores their shared goal of preserving the Imperium's unity and prosperity.
