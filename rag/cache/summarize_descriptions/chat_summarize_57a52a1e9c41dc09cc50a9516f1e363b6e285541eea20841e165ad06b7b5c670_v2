The Bene Tleilax created Duncan's ghola form, replicating his original body and memories through their advanced axlotl tank technology. This process ensured that Duncan Idaho's physical and mental attributes were preserved, though the implications of his resurrection—such as the potential restoration of his full memories or hidden conditioning—remain subjects of intrigue. The Bene Tleilax's involvement highlights their role as manipulators of life and death, often serving their own inscrutable agendas.  \n\nBoth descriptions agree on the core fact that Duncan Idaho was reborn as a ghola through the Bene Tleilax's intervention, emphasizing their pivotal role in his posthumous existence.
