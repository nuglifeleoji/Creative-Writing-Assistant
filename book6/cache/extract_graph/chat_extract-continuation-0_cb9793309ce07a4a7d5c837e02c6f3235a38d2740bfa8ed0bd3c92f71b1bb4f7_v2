心凉了半截的话。“你是我在这两天里接待的第四个救世主了，还有几十个在外面等着，但我实在没有精力见他们了。”\n　　“市长，他和他们不一样，两个世纪前……”\n　　“两个世纪前他被从几十亿人中选出来，正因为如此我才打算见你们，当然，”市长指指史强，“我找你还有事，咱们完了再谈。现在说你们的事吧，不过我有一个小小的请求：能不能先别谈你们的救世方案，那一般都很长，先说你们想让我做什么，”\n　　罗辑和史强说明来意后，市长立刻摇摇头，“就是我想帮你们也做不到，我自己目前都有一大堆事情要向高层反映，这个高层比你们想见的要低，只是省和国家的领导人，但连这都很困难，你们应该知道，现在最高层在处理更大的麻烦。”\n　　罗辑和史强一直在关注新闻，当然知道市长说的更大的麻烦是什么。\n　　在联合舰队全军覆没后，沉寂了两个世纪的逃亡主义迅速复活。欧洲联合体甚至制定了一个初步的逃亡方案，用全民抽签方式决定首批十万名逃亡人选，这个方案居然在全民投票中被通过了。但在抽签结果出来后，大多数没有抽中的人都反悔了，由此发生了大规模的骚乱，公众转而一致认为逃亡主义是反人类的罪恶。\n　　当外太空中幸存的战舰之间的黑暗战役发生后，对逃亡主义的指控又有了新的内容：事实证明，当与地球世界的精神纽带中断后，太空中的人在精神上将会发生彻底的异化，即使逃亡成功，那么幸存下来的也不再是人类文明，而是另一种黑暗邪恶的东西，和三体世界一样，这东西是人类文明的对立面和敌人，它还得到了一个名称——负文明。\n　　随着水滴向地球的逼近，公众对逃亡主义的敏感也达到了顶峰，舆论警告说很可能有人在水滴攻击地球前出逃。所有太空电梯的基点和航天发射基地周围都有大量的人群在聚集，扬言要关闭所有进入太空的通道。他们确实有这个能力，这个时代全球公民都有拥有武器的自由，民用武器大部分是小型激光枪。一支激光手枪当然不会对太空电梯的运载舱和起飞中的航天器构成威胁，但与传统枪支不同的是，大量的激光枪可以使光束在一个点上聚集，一万支手枪如果同时照射一点，将无坚不摧。聚集在太空电梯基点和航天基地周围的人少则几万，多则上百万，他们中至少有三分之一的人携带武器，当发现运载舱上升或航天器起飞时，这些人会同时拔抢照射，激光的直线弹道使瞄准很精确，大部分的光束都会聚集在目标上并将其摧毁。在这种情况下，地球与太空的交通联系几乎中断了。\n　　骚乱在发展，近两天，攻击的目标转向了同步轨道上\n######################\nOutput:",
