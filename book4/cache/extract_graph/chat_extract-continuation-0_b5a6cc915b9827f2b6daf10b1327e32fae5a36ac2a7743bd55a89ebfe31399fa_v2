\n　　玉厚老汉给老伴使了个眼色。少安妈立刻解下腰里的围裙，急急忙忙出了门——她要赶到新地方去看个究竟。不一会，少安他妈就回来了，生气地责备儿子：“你太不象话了！” \n　　“怎啦？”玉厚老汉已经认定是儿子欺负了秀莲，火气十足地问老伴。 \n　　“秀莲说少安今儿个出了一天砖，怕他熬坏了身子，给他在那面单另做了点吃的，死小子不吃就算了，还把人家骂了一顿……” \n　　少安妈说着，便收拾起一点饭，又出门给秀莲送去了。孙玉厚对低头吃饭的儿子吼着骂道：“鬼子孙！人家好心待你，你为什么要骂人家？” \n　　孙玉厚索性丢下碗不吃饭了。他手颤抖着挖了一锅旱烟。勾着头蹲在脚地上，象遭受了一次沉重的打击，脸痛苦地抽搐着。少安仍然一句话也没说，狼吞虎咽地吃完饭后，就悄无声息地出了门。他也没回新居去，径直走到烧砖窑的土场子里，闷着头打起了砖坯。 \n　　月亮从东拉河对面的山上探出了头，静静地凝视着大地。时令已经快要到白露，冷嗖嗖的风从川道里吹过来，把黄了的庄稼叶子摇得飒飒价响。暮色中，从远处的山梁上传来一阵飘忽的信天游——这是贪心劳动的田五，还在山里磨蹭着不回来…… \n　　孙少安拼命地往木模子里捧着泥巴，然后用一个小片一刮，就端起来把砖坯扣在了撒了干土的场子上。他头上冒着汗气，索性把长衫子也脱掉甩在一边，光膀子干起来了——似乎要用这挣命般的劳动把他心中的烦闷舒散出去……在少安不声不响走了以后，孙玉厚老汉还倒勾着头蹲在脚地上抽旱烟。他明白，少安和秀莲实际上还是为分家的事闹别扭。 \n　　老汉左思右想，觉得这件事不能再拖了。 \n　　他当机立断，决定马上就分家，不管儿子愿意不愿意，这家得尽快分——这事既然已经提出来，就不能再迁就着在一块过日子！现在分开还为时不晚；再拖下去，说不定一家人还要结冤仇哩！ \n　　玉厚老汉随即又想：这事应该让少平也回来一下；二小子已经长大成人了，这实际上等于是他和他哥分家，他不回来不合情理！ \n　　于是，孙玉厚老汉“叭叭”两下把烟灰在鞋帮子上磕掉，开门去找他弟孙玉亭；他要让玉亭给少平写封\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a character who is involved
