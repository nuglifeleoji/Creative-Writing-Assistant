And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica’s latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n—FROM “ANALYSIS: THE ARRAKEEN CRISIS” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN (PRIVATE CIRCULATION: B.G. FILE NUMBER AR- 81088587)\nll around the Lady Jessica—piled in corners of the\nArrakeen great hall, mounded in the open spaces —stood the packaged freight of their lives: boxes, trunks, cartons, cases—some partly unpacked. She could hear the cargo handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.\nJessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a Slow turn, looking up and around at shadowed Carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters’ Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the\nschool the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone.\nSome architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood.\nShe thought not.\nThis had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their new megalopolis of Carthag—a cheap and brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.\nAgain there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica sighed.\nAgainst a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke’s father. Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was still clutched in Jessica’s left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull’s head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull’s shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room.\nJessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things first—the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke’s buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself.\nThe head and the picture.\nThey heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these latitudes the sky looked black and cold—so much darker than the warm blue of Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.\nSo far away, Caladan.\n“Here we are!”\nThe voice was Duke Leto’s.\nShe whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall. His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked dusty and rumpled.\n“I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,” he said.\n“It is a cold house,” she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of sharp angles and planes.\nA sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage, driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor’s command.\n“The whole city feels cold,” she said.\n“It’s a dirty, dusty little garrison town,” he agreed. “But we'll change that.” He looked around the hall. “These are public rooms for state occasions. I’ve just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They’re much nicer.” He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.\nAnd again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry —a renegade House, perhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor’s own blood.\nUnder the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile. And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.\nHe remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her.\n“Where's Paul?” he asked.\n“Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.”\n“Probably in the south wing,” he said. “I thought | heard Yueh’s voice, but | couldn’t take time to look.” He glanced down at her, hesitating. “I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.”\nShe caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the key—there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for comforting. “I Saw our banner over the house as we came in,” she said.\nHe glanced at the painting of his father. “Where were you going to hang that?”\n“Somewhere in here.”\n“No.” The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.\n“My Lord,” she said, “if you’d only....”\n“The answer remains no. | indulge you shamefully in most things, not in this. I’ve just come from the dining hall where there are—”\n“My Lord! Please.”\n“The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear,” he said. “They will hang in the dining hall.”\nShe sighed. “Yes, my Lord.”\n“You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. | shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.”\n“Thank you, my Lord.”\n“And don’t go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that | never married you, my dear. Then it’d be your duty to join me at table for every meal.”\nShe held her face immobile, nodded.\n“Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,” he said. “There’s a portable in your\nroom.”\n“You anticipated this...disagreement,” she said.\n“My dear, | think also of your comfort. I’ve engaged servants. They’re locals, but Hawat has cleared them—they’re Fremen all. They'll do until our own people can be released from their other duties.”\n“Can anyone from this place be truly safe?”\n“Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.”\n“Shadout,” Jessica said. “A Fremen title?”\n“I’m told it means ‘well-dipper,’ a meaning with rather important overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan’s report. They’re convinced she wants to serve—specifically that she wants to serve you.”\n“Me?”\n“The Fremen have learned that you’re Bene Gesserit,” he said. “There are legends here about the Bene Gesserit.”\nThe Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.\n“Does this mean Duncan was successful?” she asked. “Will the Fremen be our allies?”\n“There’s nothing definite,” he said. “They wish to observe us for a while, Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period. That’s a more important gain than it might seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It\nwouldn’t have helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.”\n“A Fremen housekeeper,” Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the Shadout Mapes. “She’ll have the all-blue eyes.”\n“Don’t let the appearance of these people deceive you,” he said. “There’s a deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they'll be everything we need.”\n“It’s a dangerous gamble,” she said.\n“Let’s not go into that again,” he said.\nShe forced a smile. “We are committed, no doubt of that.” She went through the quick regimen of calmness—the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then: “When I assign rooms, is there anything special | should reserve for you?”\n“You must teach me someday how you do that,” he said, “the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.”\n“It’s a female thing,” she said.\nHe smiled. “Well, assignment of rooms: make certain | have large office space next to my sleeping quarters. There'll be more paper work here than on Caladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don’t worry about security of the house. Hawat’s men have been over it in depth.”\n“I’m sure they have.”\nHe glanced at his wristwatch. “And you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for Arrakeen local. I’ve assigned a tech to take care of it. He’ll be along presently.” He brushed a strand of her hair\nback from her forehead. “I must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle’s due any minute with my staff reserves.”\n“Couldn’t Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.”\n“The good Thufir is even busier than | am. You know this planet’s infested with Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, | must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change of fief—and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He’s allowing the opt. About eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there’s a Guild cargo ship standing by.”\n“My Lord....” She broke off, hesitating.\n“Yes?”\nHe will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n“At what time will you be expecting dinner?” she asked.\nThat’s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place—alone, the two of us, without a care.\n“I'll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late. And...ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. | want him to attend our strategy conference.”\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out,\nheaded for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the Great Hall.
