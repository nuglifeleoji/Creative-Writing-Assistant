勇气斩钉截铁地断绝和顾养民的关系。初恋中类似的犹豫不决是允许的，也常常是不可避免的。这肯定是暂时现象，事情到最后总会有个难一不二的结局。因此，我们先不必匆忙地责备我们亲爱的秀！ \n　　现在，一次意外的事故，终于把孙少平送到了她面前。 \n　　不过，尽管看起来这似乎是一种天意的安排，但事情究竟会怎样发展，我们还很难预料……得要顺便交待一下：顾养民已经在去年夏末的时候，考上了上海医科大学的硕士研究生，恋恋不舍地离开了他亲爱的姑娘，到那个庞大而杂乱的大城市深造去了。半年来，几乎每星期都要给金秀一封情意绵绵的信。他也能不断收到金秀的回信。但是，他并不知道，他所热爱的姑娘，很大一部分心思早已飞到了铜城那条小山沟的煤矿上……秀是不久前来医院实习的。这次实习的同学分散在城内各大医院，他们宿舍只有她一个人留在附属医院。白天在医院搞实习，晚上要回去照门。 \n　　今天晚上，她不能回宿舍睡觉去了。她要守护在亲爱的少平哥身边…… \n　　现在，天色已经发白。 \n　　远处传来车辆行驶的隆隆声。她没有一丝睡意，手一直握着少平的手。她知道，他此刻需要一个亲人在自己的身边。她为他的伤痛焦急难过，又为她能在这样的时候守护在他身边感到幸福…… \n　　孙少平慢慢才弄清楚了他自己发生了什么事。 \n　　伤势不轻，这他心里明白。他庆幸他还活着。 \n　　但这伤将给他留下什么后遗症，他估摸不来。头剧烈地疼。右眼象戳进了一颗铁钉。会不会成为白痴或至少会成为“独眼龙”？如果是这样，那还不如死掉！象师傅和晓霞那样干干脆脆离开这世界。 \n　　是的，他才二十七岁，还没好好活几天人。但他不愿以白痴或残疾人的身份在这个世界上活一辈子。秀说“不要紧”，这多半安慰他。如果“不要紧”，为什么要把他弄到省城来治疗？ \n　　现在，他紧紧握着秀的手不愿放开。在这样的时刻，他承认自己的精神是脆弱的。他感谢命运把秀及时地安排在他身旁，使他有个依托。 \n　　“现在……是什么时候？”他问秀。 \n　　“天已经明了。” \n　　“太阳出来了吗？” \n　　金秀抬起头，透过落地式大玻璃窗户，看见远方亮起大片的玫瑰红。 \n　　她对他说：“快了！” \n　　“太阳……”他叹息了一声。“以后还能看见太阳吗？”“怎么不能？哥哥！一切都会象过去一样。等你好了，咱们一块到郊外\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character who
