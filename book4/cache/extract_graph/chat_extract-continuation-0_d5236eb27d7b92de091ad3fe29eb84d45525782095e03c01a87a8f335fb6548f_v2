命性很强，他怎么可能让卫红和一个“阶级敌人”的子弟结婚呢？再说，那年为玉亭叔和他三妈王彩娥的事，两家人结仇太深…… \n　　金强伤心地叹了一口气，对自己亲爱的人说：“你先回去，罢了叫我想个办法。” \n　　卫红走后，悲喜交加的金强先硬劝说着让他妈喝了一碗米汤。 \n　　此后，他就一个人蹲在院墙角里，困难地咽着吐沫，不知该怎样给玉亭叔说他和卫红的亲事。 \n　　他突然想起了他二爸。二爸尽管和他们家、玉亭叔家的关系都不好，但这终究是个“大人”。他知道，二爸二妈对他一直都是好心相待，不象对父母和哥哥那样心怀敌意。事到如今，也许只能依靠二爸为他作主……金俊武听完侄儿给他叙说了他和卫红的事后，震惊得目瞪口呆，一时倒不知说什么是好。 \n　　金俊武能料到他哥他嫂和大侄子的下场，但万万料不到二侄子和孙玉亭的女儿粘到了一搭。 \n　　他首先气愤地想起孙玉亭和俊斌媳妇的“麻糊”事件。虽然那事过了好几年，一想起来仍然叫人怒不可遏。 \n　　不过，另有一股热流随即淌过了这个硬汉的心头，他为孙玉亭的女儿如此深明大义而感动不已。不简单啊！一个十九岁的女娃娃，能在这样的关头做出这样的抉择，能不叫人眼窝发热吗？ \n　　金俊武没有往下考虑，就一口答应了侄儿的请求。 \n　　金俊武同时意识到，他将要负起的是一个大家庭主事人的责任。弟弟俊斌那门人，死的死，走的走，已经断了根，哥哥俊文一家三口虽然活着，但基本上也完蛋了，只留下金强一条完整的根苗。他金俊武不能让这家人也绝了门。金强已经二十六岁，如果不是卫红这么好的孩子，那个女娃娃还愿意和贼门人家结亲？要是金强打了光棍，大哥那门人也就断了后代，金家的后世不堪设想！要是这样，他怎能对得起死去的父亲？ \n　　但是，金俊武答应了侄儿之后，才感到这事十分棘手。他和孙玉亭多年来一直势不两立，怎么可能做通他的工作呢？再说，上玉亭的门本身就令他万分为难！ \n　　唉，事到如今，他金俊武只能抹下脸去为侄儿求亲——金家再有什么资本逞强斗性哩！ \n　　金俊武突然出现在孙玉亭家的黑窑洞里，也着实让玉亭两口子大吃一惊。 \n　　虽然金俊文一家已经臭不可闻，但金俊武仍然是金俊武。对金家湾事实上的领袖登门拜访，感情上敌对的孙玉亭夫妻也不能不流露出某种�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金强<|>PERSON<|>金强 is a character
