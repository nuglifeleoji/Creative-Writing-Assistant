He felt a momentary pang for the real daughter of Otheym—dead now, a corpse in the sand. There was no time for such emotions, though. He scowled.\nBannerjee kept his attention on the girl.\n“| was told to deliver my message in secret,” she said.\n“Why?” Bannerjee demanded, voice harsh, probing.\n“Because it is my father’s wish.”\n“This is my friend,” Paul said. “Am | not a Fremen? Then my friend may hear anything | hear.”\nScytale composed the girl-shape. Was this a true Fremen custom... or was it a test?\n“The Emperor may make his own rules,” Scytale said. “This is the message: My father wishes you to come to him, bringing Chani.”\n“Why must I bring Chani?”\n“She is your woman and a Sayyadina. This is a Water matter, by the rules of our tribes. She must attest it that my father speaks according to the Fremen Way.”\nThere truly are Fremen in the conspiracy, Paul thought. This moment fitted the shape of things to come for sure. And he had no alternative but to commit himself to this course.\n“Of what will your father speak?” Paul asked.\n“He will speak of a plot against you—a plot among the Fremen.”\n“Why doesn’t he bring that message in person?” Bannerjee demanded.\nShe kept her gaze on Paul. “My father cannot come here. The plotters suspect him. He’d not survive the journey.”\n“Could he not divulge the plot to you?” Bannerjee asked. “How came he to risk his daughter on such a mission?”\n“The details are locked in a distrans carrier that only Muad’Dib may open,” she said. “This much I know.”\n“Why not send the distrans, then?” Paul asked.\n“It is a human distrans,” she said.\n“I'll go, then,” Paul said. “But l'Il go alone.”\n“Chani must come with you!”\n“Chani is with child.”\n“When has a Fremen woman refused to...”\n“My enemies fed her a subtle poison,” Paul said. “It will be a difficult birth. Her health will not permit her to accompany me now.”\nBefore Scytale could still them, strange emotions passed over the girl-features: frustration, anger. Scytale was reminded that every victim must have a way of escape—\neven such a one as Muad’Dib. The conspiracy had not failed, though. This Atreides remained in the net. He was a creature who had developed firmly into one pattern. He’d destroy himself before changing into the opposite of that pattern. That had been the way with the Tleilaxu kwisatz haderach. It’d be the way with this one. And then... the ghola.\n“Let me ask Chani to decide this,” she said.\n“| have decided it,” Paul said. “You will accompany me in Chani’s stead.”\n“It requires a Sayyadina of the Rite!”\n“Are you not Chani’s friend?”\nBoxed! Scytale thought. Does he suspect? No. He’s being Fremen-cautious. And the contraceptive is a fact. Well— there are other ways.\n“My father told me I was not to return,” Scytale said, “that | was to seek asylum with you. He said you’d not risk me.”\nPaul nodded. It was beautifully in character. He couldn’t deny this asylum. She’d plead Fremen obedience to a father’s command.\n“I'll take Stilgar’s wife, Harah,” Paul said. “You'll tell us the way to your father.”\n“How do you know you can trust Stilgar’s wife?”\n“I know it.”\n“But | don’t.”\nPaul pursed his lips, then: “Does your mother live?”\n“My true mother has gone to Shai-hulud. My second mother still lives and cares for my father. Why?”\n“She’s of Sietch Tabr?”\n“Yes.”\n“| remember her,” Paul said. “She will serve in Chani’s place.” He motioned to Bannerjee. “Have attendants take Otheym’s Lichna to suitable quarters.”\nBannerjee nodded. Attendants. The key word meant that this messenger must be put under special guard. He took\nher arm. She resisted.\n“How will you go to my father?” she pleaded.\n“You'll describe the way to Bannerjee,” Paul said. “He is my friend.”\n“No! My father has commanded it! | cannot!”\n“Bannerjee?” Paul said.\nBannerjee paused. Paul saw the man searching that encyclopedic memory which had helped bring him to his position of trust. “I Know a guide who can take you to Otheym,” Bannerjee said.\n“Then l'Il go alone,” Paul said.\n“Sire, if you...”\n“Otheym wants it this way,” Paul said, barely concealing the irony which consumed him.\n“Sire, it’s too dangerous,” Bannerjee protested.\n“Even an Emperor must accept some risks,” Paul said. “The decision is made. Do as I’ve commanded.”\nReluctantly, Bannerjee led the Face Dancer from the room.\nPaul turned toward the blank screen behind his desk. He felt that he waited for the arrival of a rock on its blind journey from some height.\nShould he tell Bannerjee about the messenger’s true nature? he wondered. No! Such an incident hadn’t been written on the screen of his vision. Any deviation here carried precipitate violence. A moment of fulcrum had to be found, a place where he could will himself out of the vision.\nIf such a moment existed...\nNo matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.\n—FROM THE TLEILAXU GODBUK\nA? he crossed over on the high footbridge from his Keep to the Qizarate Office Building, Paul added a limp to his walk. It was almost sunset and he walked through long shadows that helped conceal him, but sharp eyes still might detect something in his carriage that identified him. He wore a Shield, but it was not activated, his aides having decided that the shimmer of it might arouse suspicions.\nPaul glanced left. Strings of sandclouds lay across the sunset like slatted shutters. The air was hiereg dry through his stillsuit filters.\nHe wasn’t really alone out here, but the web of Security hadn’t been this loose around him since he’d ceased walking the streets alone in the night. Ornithopters with night scanners drifted far overhead in seemingly random patterns, all of them tied to his movements through a transmitter concealed in his clothing. Picked men walked the streets below. Others had fanned out through the city after seeing the Emperor in his disguise—Fremen costume down to the stillsuit and temag desert boots, the darkened features. His cheeks had been distorted with plastene inserts. A catchtube ran down along his left jaw.\nAs he reached the opposite end of the bridge, Paul glanced back, noted a movement beside the stone lattice that concealed a balcony of his private quarters. Chani, no\ndoubt. “Hunting for sand in the desert,” she’d called this venture.\nHow little she understood the bitter choice. Selecting among agonies, he thought, made even lesser agonies near unbearable.\nFor a blurred, emotionally painful moment, he relived their parting. At the last instant, Chani had experienced a tau-glimpse of his feelings, but she had misinterpreted. She had thought his emotions were those experienced in the parting of loved ones when one entered the dangerous unknown.\nWould that I did not know, he thought.\nHe had crossed the bridge now and entered the upper passageway through the office building. There were fixed glowglobes here and people hurrying on business. The Qizarate never slept. Paul found his attention caught by the signs above doorways, as though he were seeing them for the first time: Speed Merchants. Wind Stills and Retorts. Prophetic Prospects. Tests of Faith. Religious Supply. Weaponry ... Propagation of the Faith...\nA more honest label would’ve been Propagation of the Bureaucracy, he thought.\nA type of religious civil servant had sprung up all through his universe. This new man of the Qizarate was more often a convert. He seldom displaced a Fremen in the key posts, but he was filling all the interstices. He used melange as much to show he could afford it as for the geriatric benefits. He stood apart from his rulers—Emperor, Guild, Bene Gesserit, Landsraad, Family or Qizarate. His gods were Routine and Records. He was served by mentats and prodigious filing systems. Expediency was the first word in his catechism, although he gave proper lip-service to the precepts of the Butlerians. Machines could not be fashioned in the image of a man’s mind, he said, but he betrayed by every action that he preferred machines to men, statistics to individuals, the\nfaraway general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and initiative.\nAs Paul emerged onto the ramp at the far side of the building, he heard the bells calling the Evening Rite at Alia’s Fane.\nThere was an odd feeling of permanence about the bells.\nThe temple across the thronged square was new, its rituals of recent devising, but there was something about this setting in a desert sink at the edge of Arrakeen— something in the way wind-driven sand had begun to weather stones and plastene, something in the haphazard way buildings had gone up around the Fane. Everything conspired to produce the impression that this was a very old place full of traditions and mystery.\nHe was down into the press of people now—committed. The only guide his Security force could find had insisted it be done this way. Security hadn’t liked Paul’s ready agreement. Stilgar had liked it even less. And Chani had objected most of all.\nThe crowd around him, even while its members brushed against him, glanced his way unseeing and passed on, gave him a curious freedom of movement. It was the way they’d been conditioned to treat a Fremen, he knew. He carried himself like a man of the inner desert. Such men were quick to anger.\nAs he moved into the quickening flow to the temple steps, the crush of people became even greater. Those all around could not help but press against him now, but he found himself the target for ritual apologies: “Your pardon, noble sir. | cannot prevent this discourtesy.” “Pardon, sir; this crush of people is the worst I’ve ever seen.” “I abase myself, holy citizen. A lout shoved me.”\nPaul ignored the words after the first few. There was no feeling in them except a kind of ritual fear. He found himself, instead, thinking that he had come a long way from his boyhood days in Caladan Castle. Where had he put his foot\non the path that led to this journey across a crowded square on a planet so far from Caladan? Had he really put his foot on a path? He could not say he had acted at any point in his life for one specific reason. The motives and impinging forces had been complex—more complex possibly than any other set of goads in human history. He had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid the fate he could see so clearly along this path. But the crowd pushed him forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way, lost personal direction over his life.\nThe crowd flowed with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f8f8287cef3d3692eaeef1c69de8de7fa808d0f8d00bf8e5a21c22e73df4956b_v2"}
