Yes, it will be.\nArrakis, give me strength, he prayed. His planet remained strong and alive beneath him and around him. Its sand pressed close against the stilltent. Dune was a giant\ncounting its massed riches. It was a beguiling entity, both beautiful and grossly ugly. The only coin its merchants really knew was the bloodpulse of their own power, no matter how that power had been amassed. They possessed this planet the way a man might possess a captive mistress, or the way the Bene Gesserits possessed their Sisters.\nNo wonder Stilgar hated the merchant-priests.\nThank you, Stilgar.\nLeto recalled then the beauties of the old sietch ways, the life lived before the coming of the Imperium’s technocracy, and his mind flowed as he knew Stilgar’s dreams flowed. Before the glowglobes and lasers, before the ornithopters and spice-crawlers, there’d been another kind of life: brown- skinned mothers with babies on their hips, lamps which burned spice-oil amidst a heavy fragrance of cinnamon, Naibs who persuaded their people while knowing none could be compelled. It had been a darkswarming of life in rocky burrows...\nA terrible glove will restore the balance, Leto thought.\nPresently, he slept.\n| saw his blood and a piece of his robe which had been ripped by sharp claws. His sister reports vividly of the tigers, the sureness of their attack. We have questioned one of the plotters, and others are dead or in custody. Everything points to a Corrino plot. A Truthsayer has attested to this testimony.\n—STILGAR’S REPORT TO THE LANDSRAAD COMMISSION\nF arad’n studied Duncan Idaho through the spy circuit, seeking a clue to that strange man’s behavior. It was Shortly after noon and Idaho waited outside the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica, seeking audience with her. Would she see him? She’d know they were spied upon, of course. But would she see him?\nAround Farad’n lay the room where Tyekanik had guided the training of the Laza tigers—an illegal room, really, filled as it was with forbidden instruments from the hands of the Tleilaxu and Ixians. By the movement of switches at his right hand, Farad’n could look at Idaho from six different angles, or shift to the interior of the Lady Jessica’s suite where the spying facilities were equally sophisticated.\nIdaho’s eyes bothered Farad’n. Those pitted metal orbs which the Tleilaxu had given their ghola in the regrowth tanks marked their possessor as profoundly different from other humans. Farad’n touched his own eyelids, feeling the hard surfaces of the permanent contact lenses which concealed the total blue of his spice addiction. Idaho’s eyes must record a different universe. How could it be otherwise. It almost tempted Farad’n to seek out the Tleilaxu surgeons and answer that question himself.\nWhy did Idaho try to kill himself?\nWas that really what he’d tried? He must’ve known we wouldn’t permit it.\nIdaho remained a dangerous question mark.\nTyekanik wanted to keep him on Salusa or kill him. Perhaps that would be best.\nFarad’n shifted to a frontal view. Idaho sat on a hard bench outside the door to the Lady Jessica’s suite. It was a windowless foyer with light wood walls decorated by lance pennants. Idaho had been on that bench more than an hour and appeared ready to wait there forever. Farad’n bent close to the screen. The loyal swordmaster of the Atreides, instructor of Paul Muad’Dib, had been treated kindly by his years on Arrakis. He’d arrived with a youthful spring in his step. A steady spice diet must have helped him, of course. And that marvelous metabolic balance which the Tleilaxu tanks always imparted. Did Idaho really remember his past before the tanks? No other whom the Tleilaxu had revived could claim this. What an enigma this Idaho was!\nThe reports of his death were in the library. The Sardaukar who'd slain him reported his prowess: nineteen of their number dispatched by Idaho before he’d fallen. Nineteen Sardaukar! His flesh had been well worth sending to the regrowth tanks. But the Tleilaxu had made a mentat out of him. What a strange creature lived in that regrown flesh. How did it feel to be a human computer in addition to all of his other talents?\nWhy did he try to kill himself?\nFarad’n knew his own talents and held few illusions about them. He was a historian-archaeologist and judge of men. Necessity had forced him to become an expert on those who would serve him—necessity and a careful study of the Atreides. He saw it as the price always demanded of aristocracy. To rule required accurate and incisive judgments about those who wielded your power. More than one ruler had fallen through mistakes and excesses of his underlings.\nCareful study of the Atreides revealed a superb talent in choosing servants. They’d known how to maintain loyalty, how to keep a fine edge on the ardor of their warriors.\nIdaho was not acting in character.\nWhy?\nFarad’n squinted his eyes, trying to see past the skin of this man. There was a sense of duration about Idaho, a feeling that he could not be worn down. He gave the impression of being self-contained, an organized and firmly integrated whole. The Tleilaxu tanks had set something more than human into motion. Farad’n sensed this. There was a Self-renewing movement about the man, as though he acted in accordance with immutable laws, beginning anew at every ending. He moved in a fixed orbit with an endurance about him like that of a planet around a star. He would respond to pressure without breaking—merely shifting his orbit slightly but not really changing anything basic.\nWhy did he cut his wrist?\nWhatever his motive, he had done it for the Atreides, for his ruling House. The Atreides were the star of his orbit.\nSomehow he believes that my holding the Lady Jessica here strengthens the Atreides.\nAnd Farad’n reminded himself: A mentat thinks this.\nIt gave the thought an added depth. Mentats made mistakes, but not often.\nHaving come to this conclusion, Farad’n almost summoned his aides to have them send the Lady Jessica away with Idaho. He poised himself on the point of acting, withdrew.\nBoth of those people—the ghola-mentat and the Bene Gesserit witch—remained counters of unknown denomination in this game of power. Idaho must be sent back because that would certainly stir up troubles on Arrakis. Jessica must be kept here, drained of her strange knowledge to benefit House Corrino.\nFarad’n knew it was a subtle and deadly game he played. But he had prepared himself for this possibility over the years, ever since he’d realized that he was more intelligent, more sensitive than those around him. It had been a frightening discovery for a child, and he knew the library had been his refuge as well as his teacher.\nDoubts ate at him now, though, and he wondered if he was quite up to this game. He’d alienated his mother, lost her counsel, but her decisions had always been dangerous to him. Tigers! Their training had been an atrocity and their use had been stupidity. How easy they were to trace! She Should be thankful to suffer nothing more than banishment. The Lady Jessica’s advice had fitted his needs with a lovely precision there. She must be made to divulge the way of that Atreides thinking.\nHis doubts began to fade away. He thought of his Sardaukar once more growing tough and resilient through the rigorous training and the denial of luxury which he commanded. His Sardaukar legions remained small, but once more they were a man-to-man match for the Fremen. That served little purpose as long as the limits imposed by the Treaty of Arrakeen governed the relative size of the forces. Fremen could overwhelm him by their numbers— unless they were tied up and weakened by civil war.\nIt was too soon for a battle of Sardaukar against Fremen. He needed time. He needed new allies from among the discontented Houses Major and the newly powerful from the Houses Minor. He needed access to CHOAM financing. He needed the time for his Sardaukar to grow stronger and the Fremen to grow weaker.\nAgain Farad’n looked at the screen which revealed the patient ghola. Why did Idaho want to see the Lady Jessica at this time? He would know they were spied upon, that every word, every gesture would be recorded and analyzed.\nWhy?\nFarad’n glanced away from the screen to the ledge beside his control console. In the pale electronic light he could make out the spools which contained the latest reports from Arrakis. His spies were thorough; he had to give them credit. There was much to give him hope and pleasure in those reports. He closed his eyes, and the high points of those reports passed through his mind in the oddly editorial form to which he’d reduced the spools for his own uses:\nAs the planet is made fertile, Fremen are freed of land pressures and their new communities lose the traditional sietch-stronghold character. From infancy, in the old sietch culture, the Fremen was taught by the rota: “Like the knowledge of your own being, the sietch forms a firm base from which you move out into the world and into the universe.”\nThe traditional Fremen says: “Look to the Massif,” meaning that the master science is the Law. But the new social structure is loosening those old legal restrictions; discipline grows lax. The new Fremen leaders know only their Low Catechism of ancestry plus the history which is camouflaged in the myth structure of their songs. People of the new communities are more volatile, more open; they quarrel more often and are less responsive to authority. The old sietch folk are more disciplined, more inclined to group actions and they tend to work harder; they are more careful of their resources. The old folk still believe that the orderly society is the fulfillment of the individual. The young grow away from this belief. Those remnants of the older culture which remain look at the young and say: “The death wind has etched away their past.”\nFarad’n liked the pointedness of his own summary. The new diversity on Arrakis could only bring violence. He had the essential concepts firmly etched into the spools:\nThe religion of Muad’Dib is based firmly in the old Fremen sietch cultural tradition while the new culture moves farther and farther from those disciplines.\nNot for the first time, Farad’n asked himself why Tyekanik had embraced that religion. Tyekanik behaved oddly in his new morality. He seemed utterly sincere, but carried along as though against his will. Tyekanik was like one who had stepped into the whirlwind to test it and had been caught up by forces beyond his control. Tyekanik’s conversion annoyed Farad’n by its characterless completeness. It was a reversion to very old Sardaukar ways. He warned that the young Fremen might yet revert in a similar way, that the inborn, ingrained traditions would prevail.\nOnce more Farad’n thought about those report spools. They told of a disquieting thing: the persistence of a cultural remnant from the most ancient Fremen times—“The Water of Conception.” The amniotic fluid of the newborn was saved at birth, distilled into the first water fed to that child. The traditional form required a godmother to serve the water, saying: “Here is the water of thy conception.” Even the young Fremen still followed this tradition with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet, also known as Dune, rich in spice and central to the power struggles of the universe\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a character who reflects on the old sietch ways and the changes brought by the Imperium's technocracy\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen leader who reports to the Landsraad Commission about a Corrino plot involving tigers\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with deep political and genetic influence\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPERIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Imperium is a vast political entity that enforces technocracy and controls the known universe\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LANDSRAAD COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Landsraad Commission is a political body that receives reports and governs inter-House relations\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FARAD’N<|>PERSON<|>Farad’n is a historian-archaeologist and a key player in the power struggles, allied with House Corrino\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola-mentat, a revived warrior with mentat abilities, loyal to the Atreides\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and mother of Paul Muad’Dib, held captive by Farad’n\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TYEKANIK<|>PERSON<|>Tyekanik is a Sardaukar leader who converted to the religion of Muad’Dib and trains Laza tigers\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive group known for their genetic engineering and ghola technology\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixians are a technologically advanced group that collaborates with the Tleilaxu\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SARDauKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are the elite military force of House Corrino\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are the native people of Arrakis, known for their fierce independence and martial skills\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Corrino is a powerful noble house, historically the rulers of the Imperium\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Atreides is a noble house, rivals of House Corrino, and central to the power struggles\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TREATY OF ARRAKEEN<|>EVENT<|>The Treaty of Arrakeen is a historical agreement that limits military forces and governs interstellar relations\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LAZA TIGERS<|>EVENT<|>The Laza tigers are trained creatures used in assassination attempts, linked to a Corrino plot\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ARRAKIS<|>Leto reflects on the strength and life of Arrakis, his home planet<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>LANDSRAAD COMMISSION<|>Stilgar reports to the Landsraad Commission about a Corrino plot<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Farad’n studies Duncan Idaho, seeking to understand his motives and loyalty<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>LADY JESSICA<|>Farad’n holds Lady Jessica captive to extract Bene Gesserit knowledge<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LADY JESSICA<|>Duncan Idaho seeks audience with Lady Jessica, likely to strategize for the Atreides<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TYEKANIK<|>LAZA TIGERS<|>Tyekanik trained the Laza tigers for use in a Corrino plot<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD’N<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>Farad’n is a key figure in House Corrino’s power struggles<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>Duncan Idaho is fiercely loyal to House Atreides<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>LADY JESSICA<|>Lady Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>The Tleilaxu revived Duncan Idaho as a ghola and gave him mentat abilities<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SARDauKAR<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>The Sardaukar are the elite military force of House Corrino<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Fremen are the native people of Arrakis, deeply tied to its culture and environment<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPERIUM<|>HOUSE CORRINO<|>The Imperium is historically ruled by House Corrino<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TREATY OF ARRAKEEN<|>FREMEN<|>The Treaty of Arrakeen limits the military power of the Fremen<|>6\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
