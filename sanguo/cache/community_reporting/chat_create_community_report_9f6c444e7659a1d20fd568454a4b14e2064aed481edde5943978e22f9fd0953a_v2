He became the first emperor of the state of Cao Wei, a position he attained through a series of political maneuvers and military campaigns aimed at consolidating power and expanding his territory.\n\nCao Pi's ascension to the throne was marked by the abdication ceremony at the Shouchan Altar (受禅坛), where he officially took over the leadership of Wei. His reign was characterized by his efforts to usurp the Han dynasty, positioning himself as a central figure in the power struggles that defined the era. As the ruler of Wei, he was involved in various political strategies and military confrontations against rival states, particularly Shu Han and Eastern Wu. His ambitions included plans to launch military campaigns against Shu Han to further extend Wei's influence and territory.\n\nThroughout his rule, Cao Pi was recognized not only for his political acumen but also for his military leadership. He engaged in multiple military confrontations with the other kingdoms, showcasing his determination to solidify Wei's power in a fragmented China. His governance was marked by a focus on succession and the establishment of a stable regime following his father's legacy.\n\nIn summary, Cao Pi was a pivotal figure in the establishment of the state of Wei, known for his ambition, political maneuvering, and military strategies during the Three Kingdoms period. His legacy includes his role as the first emperor of Wei and his efforts to expand the state’s territory through military action against rival kingdoms.\",19\r\n1621,受禅坛,\"The \"\"受禅坛\"\" is a significant ceremonial platform in Chinese history, specifically associated with the transfer of power during the abdication and succession process. This platform is most notably recognized for its role in the historic event where the Han Emperor (汉帝) formally abdicated his throne to Cao Pi (曹丕). The ceremony that took place on the 受禅坛 marked a pivotal moment in the transition of power, symbolizing the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Cao Wei state during the Three Kingdoms period. The 受禅坛 thus serves as a crucial site for understanding the dynamics of power transfer in ancient China, highlighting the ceremonial and political significance of such events in the context of imperial succession.\",2\r\n813,甄氏,\"Zhen Shi was the wife of Yuan Xi, who remained behind during the conflict and was later encountered by Cao Pi.\",1\r\n1608,汉王,\"汉王 refers to the emperor of the Han dynasty, who is being pressured to abdicate in favor of 曹丕.\",1\r\n1611,凤凰,The appearance of the 凤凰 (phoenix) is considered a celestial sign indicating the rise of Wei and the fall of Han.,1\r\n1612,麒麟,The appearance of the 麒麟 (qilin) is another celestial sign interpreted as a sign of Wei's legitimacy to rule.,1\r\n1613,黄龙,The appearance of the 黄龙 (yellow dragon) is seen as a divine sign that supports the transition of power from Han to Wei.,1\r\n1620,汉帝,\"汉帝 is the emperor who established the ceremony of abdication at the受禅坛, transferring power to 曹丕.\",1\r\n1622,大魏,大魏 is the new state established by 曹丕 after receiving the throne.,1\r\n1370,黄权,\"黄权 is a notable military officer and official associated with the historical context of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the subsequent Three Kingdoms period in China.

His allegiance to 张鲁 suggests that he was involved in the broader political and military maneuvers characteristic of the era.\n\nIn addition to his military duties, 黄权 held an official position in 益州, where he notably opposed the surrender of 刘璋 (Liu Zhang). This opposition highlights his commitment to the defense of his region and his resistance against external pressures, particularly from rival factions seeking to gain control over 益州.\n\n黄权 also served under 汉中王 (Han Zhongwang), further emphasizing his status as a significant official within the political hierarchy of the time. His service under such a prominent figure indicates his influence and the trust placed in him to manage military and administrative responsibilities.\n\nHowever, despite his earlier efforts and positions of authority, 黄权 ultimately faced defeat in battle, which led to his surrender to the rival state of 魏国 (Wei). This turn of events marks a significant shift in his fortunes, illustrating the volatile nature of loyalty and power during the tumultuous period of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nIn summary, 黄权 is depicted as a complex figure who navigated the intricate political and military landscape of his time. He was a military officer sent by 张鲁, an official in 益州 who opposed 刘璋's surrender, and a servant under 汉中王. His eventual defeat and surrender to 魏国 encapsulate the challenges faced by military leaders in an era marked by conflict and shifting allegiances.\",6\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2830,曹丕,受禅坛,曹丕 received the throne at the受禅坛 during the abdication ceremony,21\r\n1227,曹丕,甄氏,\"Cao Pi encountered Zhen Shi during the conflict, indicating a personal connection amidst the chaos\",20\r\n2808,曹丕,汉王,\"汉王 is being pressured by his ministers to abdicate in favor of 曹丕, who is seen as the rightful ruler.\",20\r\n2812,曹丕,凤凰,The appearance of the 凤凰 is interpreted as a sign that supports 曹丕's claim to the throne.,20\r\n2813,曹丕,麒麟,The appearance of the 麒麟 is seen as a divine endorsement of 曹丕's rule.,20\r\n2814,曹丕,黄龙,The 黄龙's appearance is viewed as a celestial sign favoring 曹丕's ascension to power.,20\r\n2829,汉帝,曹丕,汉帝 transferred the throne to 曹丕 during the abdication ceremony at the受禅坛,20\r\n2831,曹丕,大魏,曹丕 established the state of 大魏 after receiving the throne,20\r\n2297,张鲁,黄权,黄权 is sent by 张鲁 to assist in the military efforts against 刘璋,14\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
