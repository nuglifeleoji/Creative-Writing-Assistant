福堂一起回到了双水村。互相不能说服对方的父子俩，都把胜利的希望寄托在润生他妈身上。田福堂指望他老婆能劝解儿子放弃这宗荒唐的亲事——润生向来听他妈的话。而润生又盼望母亲能理解他，站在他一边劝解父亲，帮助他成全自己的婚姻。 \n　　可他妈一听这事，先一鼻子哭得连话也说不成了。她实际上比父亲还要坚决地反对这亲事。她痛不欲生地絮叨说：“润叶的婚姻是那么个样子，你现在又要找个二婚女人，带着前家的娃娃……” \n　　“还是地主成分！”田福堂加添说，“咱里亲外戚中连个中农成分也没，你却要把地主的后代引到家里来。田家的门风叫你糟塌完了！ \n　　绝望的田润生丢下哭啼的母亲和咆哮的父亲，一个人踉踉跄跄从家里走出来。他感到东拉河对面的庙坪山和神仙山，都在疯狂地旋转过来；虽然天晴日丽，但他眼前一片黑暗！ \n　　他不知不觉竟走到孙玉亭家里。他知道玉亭叔和父亲关系比较好，就想让他给父亲做点工作。这真是病急乱救医！ \n　　孙玉亭正圪蹴在院子的磨盘上看报纸。当他听完润生的陈述之后，把报纸卷起别在胸前仅有的那两颗钮扣中间，拖拉起两只烂鞋就和润生一块到他家里来了。 \n　　玉亭总算念过几天书，又在太原钢厂当了几年工人，经见过世面，因此对这事倒能理解。他赶到田福堂家里，象位敢对“圣上”谏言的忠臣一样，对书记夫妇说：“福堂哥，嫂子，你们要尊重润生这感情哩。既然润生和那寡妇有爱情，你们就要理解娃娃哩！二婚女人又怎？当然，农村对这事有说法，可那是封建主义！”孙玉亭说得倒振振有辞。“你懂个屁！谁叫你来骚这杨柳情？”田福堂气愤地对他的助手出言不恭地喝骂道，他讨厌玉亭到他家里来火上加油。 \n　　孙玉亭立刻被田福堂骂得张口结舌，说不上话来了。他再一次意识到，田福堂已经不再把他孙玉亭当一回事。 \n　　玉亭一看他说话等于放屁，啥事也不顶，就知趣地拖拉着鞋离开了田福堂的家……田福堂一家三口人同时陷入到了深深的痛苦之中。田润生在几天内就好象变成了另外一个人。他目光呆滞，神情恍惚，本来就很瘦弱的身体又瘦了几圈；袖简和裤管里伸出来的胳膊腿，竟象麻杆般纤细。他再也不跟他姐夫去开汽车了，整天神神\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
