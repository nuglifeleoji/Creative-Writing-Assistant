it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It’s a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are children to train that the tribe’s strength may never be lost.”\n“Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?” he asked.\n“The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food. Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on.”\n“My sister, Alla—is she accepted yet by the people?”\nChani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight. Her eyes bored into him. “It’s a thing to be discussed another time, beloved.”\n“Let us discuss it now.”\n“You should conserve your energies for the test,” she said.\nHe saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal in her voice. “The unknown brings its own worries,” he said.\nPresently she nodded, said, “There is yet... misunderstanding because of Alia’s strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more than an infant talks...of things that only an adult should know.\nThey do not understand the...change in the womb that made Alia...different.”\n“There is trouble?” he asked. And he thought: /’ve seen visions of trouble over Alia.\nChani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise. “Some of the women banded to appeal to the Reverend Mother. They demanded she exorcise the demon in her daughter. They quoted the scripture: ‘Suffer not a witch to live among us.’”\n“And what did my mother say to them?”\n“She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: ‘If Alia incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing the trouble.’ And she tried to explain how the change had worked on Alia in the womb. But the women were angry because they had been embarrassed. They went away muttering.”\nThere will be trouble because of Alia, he thought.\nA crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face, bringing the scent of the pre- spice mass. “El-Sayal, the rain of sand that brings the morning,” he said.\nHe looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the landscape beyond pity, the sand that was form absorbed in itself. Dry lightning streaked a dark corner to the south—sign that a storm had built up its static charge there. The roll of thunder boomed long after.\n“The voice that beautifies the land,” Chani said.\nMore of his men were stirring out of their tents. Guards were coming in from the rims. Everything\naround him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that required no orders.\n“Give as few orders as possible,” his father had told him...once...long ago. “Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that Subject.”\nThe Fremen knew this rule instinctively.\nThe troop’s watermaster began the morning chanty, adding to it now the call for the rite to initiate a sandrider.\n“The world is a carcass,” the man chanted, his voice wailing across the dunes. “Who can turn away the Angel of Death? What Shai-hulud has decreed must be.”\nPaul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the death chant of his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they hurled themselves into battle.\nWill there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another soul? Paul asked himself. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add another stone and think on Muad’Dib who died in this place?\nHe knew this was among the alternatives today, a fact along lines of the future radiating from this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued him. The more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of the jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His entire future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm—the violent nexus beyond which all was fog and clouds.\n“Stilgar approaches,” Chani said. “I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, | must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the Chronicles.” She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then she had herself under control. “When this is past, | shall prepare thy breakfast with my own hands,” she said. She turned away.\nStilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, Stirring up little dust puddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed Stare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the lines of craggy cheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock for all their movement.\nThe man carried Paul’s banner on its staff—the green and black banner with a water tube in the staff —that already was a legend in the land. Half pridefully, Paul thought: / cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a legend. They will mark how I parted from Chani, how I greet Stilgar—every move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. | must not die. Then it will be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad.\nStilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his sides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought how his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice.\n“They denied us the Hajj,” Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.\nAs Chani had taught him, Paul responded: “Who can deny a Fremen the right to walk or ride where he wills?”\n“Lam a Naib,” Stilgar said, “never to be taken alive. | am a leg of the death tripod that will destroy our foes.”\nSilence settled over them.\nPaul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar, the way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer. And he thought of how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing, an entire people who had lived with rage and grief all of their days, never once considering what might take the place of either— except for a dream with which Liet-Kynes had infused them before his death.\n“Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?” Stilgar asked.\n“He is ever with us,” the Fremen chanted.\nStilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice. “Now, remember what | told you. Do it simply and directly—nothing fancy. Among our people, we ride the maker at the age of twelve. You are more than six years beyond that age and not born to this life. You don’t have to impress anyone with your courage. We know you are brave. All you must do is call the maker and ride him.”\n“I will remember,” Paul said.\n“See that you do. l'Il not have you shame my teaching.”\nStilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe. The thing was pointed at one\nend, had a spring-wound clapper at the other end. “l prepared this thumper myself. It’s a good one. Take it.”\nPaul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.\n“Shishakli has your hooks,” Stilgar said. “He'll hand them to you as you step out onto that dune over there.” He pointed to his right. “Call a big maker, Usul. Show us the way.”\nPaul marked the tone of Stilgar’s voice—half ritual and half that of a worried friend.\nIn that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took on the silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and dryness even for Arrakis.\n“It is the time of the scalding day,” Stilgar said, and now his voice was entirely ritual. “Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader of men.”\nPaul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply now that the dawn wind had died. He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated —a dirty tan slope with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving out in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their camp.\nOne robed figure remained in Paul’s path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the Fedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask.\nShishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The shafts were about a meter and\na half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end, roughened at the other end for a firm grip.\nPaul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.\n“They are my own hooks,” Shishakli said in a husky voice. “They never have failed.”\nPaul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and up the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like a flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy ridge with only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a good dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the viewpoint vantage.\nStooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming. Then he hesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death necessities that faced him.\nWhen he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the sand, a giant worm—a maker—would hear and come to the drumming. With the whiplike hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker’s high curving back. For as long as a forward edge of a worm’s ring segment was held open by a hook, open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior, the creature would not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact, roll its gigantic body to bring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible.\nlam a sandrider, Paul told himself.\nHe glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only to shift those hooks down the curve of a maker’s immense side to make the creature roll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it done. He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.\nOnce he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland—to rest and restore himself—into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.\nHe lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.\n“You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,” Stilgar had explained. “You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you.”\nWith abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper’s latch. The clapper began", " He had seen it done. He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.\nOnce he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland—to rest and restore himself—into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.\nHe lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.\n“You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,” Stilgar had explained. “You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you.”\nWith abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper’s latch. The clapper began revolving and the summons drummed through the sand, a measured “lump... lump...lump....”\nHe straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar’s words: “Judge the line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an unseen approach to a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it before you see it.”\nAnd Chanit’s words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him overcame her, filled his mind: “When you take your stand along the maker’s path, you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand. Hide beneath your cloak and become a little dune in your very essence.”\nSlowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had been taught.\nIt came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently he saw the faraway outline of the creature’s track against the dawnlight and realized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of one this size. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the rise of the sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain.\nThis is nothing | have seen by vision or in life, Paul cautioned himself. He hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand, caught up entirely by the rushing needs of this moment.\n“Control the coinage and the courts—let the rabble have the rest.” Thus the Padishah Emperor advised you. And he tells you: “If you want profits, you must rule.” There is truth in these words, but | ask myself: “Who are the rabble and who are the ruled?”\n—MUAD'DIB’S SECRET MESSAGE TO THE LANDSRAAD FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA thought came unbidden to Jessica’s mind: Paul will be undergoing his sandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but it’s obvious.\nAnd Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.\nJessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the night’s classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had enjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place had thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand, multicolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that she had come to associate with a sense of security.\nYet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place. It was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.\nA faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber. Jessica knew it for a birth\ncelebration, probably Subiay’s. Her time was near. And Jessica knew she'd see the baby soon enough—a blue-eyed cherub brought to the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would be at the celebration and would report on it.\nIt was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn't have started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave raids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.\nJessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and the dangers he faced— the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural dangers of the desert—makers and thirst and dust chasms.\nShe thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen endured.\nA dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup upon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.\nAn offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.\nShe took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society of our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? | could alter any poison now before it did me harm, of course, but the donor doesn’t realize this.\nShe drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents—hot and delicious.\nAnd she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift—with only a slight tinge of fear.\nAnother element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had thought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism.\nAnd the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.\nHas Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He’s capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable.\nThe waiting.\nIt’s the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the dreariness of the waiting overcomes you.\nThere was all manner of waiting in their lives.\nMore than two years we’ve been here, she thought, and twice that number at least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.\n“Reverend Mother?”\nThe voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other woman in Paul’s menage.\n“Yes, Harah.”\nThe hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch sandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders. Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an insect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were drawn into an intense frown.\nBehind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.\nSeeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia’s resemblance to Paul at that age—the same wide-eyed solemnity to her questing look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle differences, too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child—little more than a toddler—carried herself with a calmness and awareness beyond her years. Adults were Shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of words\nbetween the sexes. Or they’d catch themselves listening to her half-lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two-year-old had ever encountered.\nHarah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.\n“Alia.” Jessica motioned to her daughter.\nThe child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her mother’s hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had shared since before Alia’s birth. It wasn’t a matter of shared thoughts—although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing the spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate awareness of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-simpatico that made them emotionally one.\nIn the formal manner that befitted a member of her son’s household, Jessica said: “Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?”\nWith the same traditional formality, she said: “Subakh un nar. | am well.” The words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.\nJessica sensed amusement from Alia.\n“My brother’s ghanima is annoyed with me,” Alia said in her half-lisp.\nJessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah—ghanima. In the subtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant “something acquired in battle” and with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its original\npurpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.\nHarah scowled at the child. “Don’t try to insult me, child. | know my place.”\n“What have you done this time, Alia?” Jessica asked.\nHarah answered: “Not only has she refused to play with the other children today, but she intruded where....”\n“I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay’s child being born,” Alia said. “It’s a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he’d cried long enough—”\n“She came out and touched him,” Harah said, “and he stopped crying. Everyone knows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he’s in sietch because he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr.”\n“He'd cried enough,” Alia said. “I just wanted to feel his spark, his life. That’s all. And when he felt me he didn’t want to cry anymore.”\n“It’s just made more talk among the people,” Harah said.\n“Subiay’s boy is healthy?” Jessica asked. She saw that something was troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.\n“Healthy as any mother could ask,” Harah said. “They know Alia didn’t hurt him. They didn’t so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and was happy. | was....” Harah shrugged.\n“It’s the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?” Jessica asked. “It’s the way she speaks of things\nbeyond her years and of things no child her age could know—things of the past.”\n“How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?” Harah demanded.\n“But he does!” Alia said. “Subiay’s boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting.”\n“Alia!” Jessica said. “I warned you.”\n“But, Mother, | saw it and it was true and....”\nJessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah’s face. What have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth everything that I knew...and more: everything revealed to her out of", " know Alia didn’t hurt him. They didn’t so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and was happy. | was....” Harah shrugged.\n“It’s the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?” Jessica asked. “It’s the way she speaks of things\nbeyond her years and of things no child her age could know—things of the past.”\n“How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?” Harah demanded.\n“But he does!” Alia said. “Subiay’s boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting.”\n“Alia!” Jessica said. “I warned you.”\n“But, Mother, | saw it and it was true and....”\nJessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah’s face. What have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth everything that I knew...and more: everything revealed to her out of the corridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.\n“It’s not just the things she says,” Harah said. “It’s the exercises, too: the way she sits and stares ata rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose, or a muscle on the back of a finger, or—”\n“Those are the Bene Gesserit training,” Jessica said. “You know that, Harah. Would you deny my daughter her inheritance?”\n“Reverend Mother, you know these things don’t matter to me,” Harah said. “It’s the people and the way they mutter. | feel danger in it. They say your daughter’s a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that she’s—”\n“She has so little in common with the other children,” Jessica said. “She’s no demon. It’s just the\n“Of course she’s not!”\nJessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah’s tone, glanced down at Alia. The child\nappeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of... waiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.\n“I respect the fact that you’re a member of my son’s household,” Jessica said. (Alia stirred against her hand.) “You may speak openly with me of whatever's troubling you.”\n“I will not be a member of your son’s household much longer,” Harah said. “I’ve waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they receive as the children of Usul. It’s little enough | could give them since it’s known | don’t share your son’s bed.”\nAgain Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.\n“You'd have made a good companion for my son, though,” Jessica said. And she added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion...not a wife. Jessica’s thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came from the common talk in the sietch that her son’s companionship with Chani had become a permanent thing, the marriage.\n| love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have to step aside for royal necessity. Royal marriages had other reasons than love.\n“You think | don’t know what you plan for your son?” Harah asked.\n“What do you mean?” Jessica demanded.\n“You plan to unite the tribes under Him,” Harah Said.\n“Is that bad?”\n“I see danger for him...and Alia is part of that danger.”\nAlia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.\n“I’ve watched you two together,” Harah said, “the way you touch. And Alia is like my own flesh because she’s sister to one who is like my brother. I’ve watched over her and guarded her from the time she was amere baby, from the time of the razzia when we fled here. I’ve seen many things about her.”\nJessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.\n“You know what | mean,” Harah said. “The way she knew from the first what we were saying to her. When has there been another baby who knew the water discipline so young? What other baby’s first words to her nurse were: ‘I love you, Harah’?”\nHarah stared at Alia. “Why do you think | accept her insults? | know there’s no malice in them.”\nAlia looked up at her mother.\n“Yes, | have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother,” Harah said. “I could have been of the Sayyadina. | have seen what I have seen.”\n“Harah....” Jessica shrugged. “I don’t know what to say.” And she felt surprise at herself, because this literally was true.\nAlia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.\n“We made a mistake,” Alia said. “Now we need Harah.”\n“It was the ceremony of the seed,” Harah said, “when you changed the Water of Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.”\nNeed Harah? Jessica asked herself.\n“Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?” Alia asked.\n“What would you have her do?” Jessica asked.\n“She already knows what to do,” Alia said.\n“I will tell them the truth,” Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old and sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp features. “I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that she has never been a little girl.”\nAlia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.\n“I know I’m a freak,” Alia whispered. The adult Summation coming from the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation.\n“You're not a freak!” Harah snapped. “Who dared Say you're a freak?”\nAgain, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah’s voice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly—they did need Harah. The tribe would understand Harah—both her words and her emotions—for it was obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child.\n“Who said it?” Harah repeated.\n“Nobody.”\nAlia used a corner of Jessica’s aba to wipe the tears from her face. She smoothed the robe where She had dampened and crumpled it.\n“Then don’t you Say it,” Harah ordered.\n“Yes, Harah.”\n“Now,” Harah said, “you may tell me what it was like so that | may tell the others. Tell me what it is that happened to you.”\nAlia swallowed, looked up at her mother.\nJessica nodded.\n“One day | woke up,” Alia said. “It was like waking from sleep except that | could not remember going to Sleep. | was in a warm, dark place. And | was frightened.”\nListening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that day in the big cavern.\n“When I was frightened,” Alia said, “I tried to escape, but there was no way to escape. Then | saw a Spark...but it wasn’t exactly like seeing it. The spark was just there with me and | felt the spark’s emotions...soothing me, comforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was my mother.”\nHarah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a look of wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too, were trying to hear Alia’s words.\nAnd Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks...out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?\n“Just when I felt safe and reassured,” Alia said, “there was another spark with us...and everything was happening at once. The other spark was the old Reverend Mother. She was...trading lives with my mother...everything...and | was there with them, seeing it all...everything. And it was over, and | was them and all the others and myself...only it took mea\nlong time to find myself again. There were so many others.”\n“It was a cruel thing,” Jessica said. “No being should wake into consciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to you.”\n“I couldn’t do anything else!” Alia said. “I didn’t know how to reject or hide my consciousness...or Shut it off...everything just happened...everything....”\n“We didn’t know,” Harah murmured. “When we gave your mother the Water to change, we didn’t know you existed within her.”\n“Don’t be sad about it, Harah,” Alia said. “l Shouldn’t feel sorry for myself. After all, there’s cause for happiness here: I’m a Reverend Mother. The tribe has two Rev....”\nShe broke off, tipping her head to listen.\nHarah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia, bringing her attention then up to Jessica’s face.\n“Didn’t you suspect?” Jessica asked.\n“Sh-h-h-h,” Alia said.\nA distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated them from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now: “Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!”\nThe chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to the inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.\nWhen the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the sadness in her voice: “It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse.”\n“My family sat in their pool courtyard,” Harah said, “in air bathed by the moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree of portyguls, round and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket with mish-mish and baklawa and mugs of liban—all manner of good things to eat. In our gardens and in our flocks, there was peace...peace in all the land.”\n“Life was full with happiness until the raiders came,” Alia said.\n“Blood ran cold at the scream of friends,” Jessica said. And she felt the memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.\n“La, la, la, the women cried,” said Harah.\n“The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives dripping red from the lives of our men,” Jessica said.\nSilence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the sietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.\nPresently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.\n“We will never forgive and we will never forget,” Harah said.\nIn the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of people, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber.\n“Reverend Mother?”\nA woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgar’s wives.\n“What is it, Tharthar?”\n“There is trouble, Reverend Mother.”\nJessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. “Paul...” she gasped.\nTharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at Tharthar—a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_cebbdbcdeb67588897a5bc1d80e22acafdded27a1c3953c52364904d3177fd7a_v2"}
