\n　　不客气地说，田福军这样做对不起他深情热爱的原西人民。他的错误是不能原谅的……福军调进省城后，黄原新任地委书记呼正文一上任，第一个重大的人事变动就是改换原西县委书记。正文过去长时间当过地委管组织工作的副书记，他很熟悉全区的干部情况。客观地说，个人能力田福军要胜过呼正文；但在用人方面，正文比田福军水平高。 \n　　呼正文一上任就撤换张有智不是和福军唱对台戏。实际上，他和福军、有智的个人关系都不错。但不能因个人的关系就把一个县交给亲朋好友去糟践嘛！连自己的父亲和儿子也没这种权利！作为多年搞组织工作的正文，他最反感和痛心现在某些高级干部千方百计利用权力安插自己的亲信和子女当官。这是一切社会风气不正的总根源。上梁不正下梁歪！如果我们自己胡作非为，还在喋喋不休地谈论纠正不正之风，谁都会知道这是庄严的谎话……张有智的下台和新县委书记的任命，在原西县引起了极大的震动。无论干部还是群众，都由衷地欢迎县委“改朝换代”。 \n　　下台的有智同志这次是真的生了病——不幸的是，这病又是药吃出来的。 \n　　张有智今年五十四岁。 \n　　五十岁左右是人生一个极其重要的时期。俗话说，岁数不饶人，一到这个年龄，人都有一种衰老的感觉，随之生理上也会产生一些重大变化；生理上的变化又会影响心理上的变化。因此，人们通常把这一时期称作男人的“更年期”。我们常常在生活中可以感觉到，并不是进入“更年期”的男人就一定要“变态”。相反，一些进入老年期，却由原来的不可爱变为可爱了。这是一个对自己一生的总结期。人往往到此时才心平气静地回顾自己已经走过的生命历程，洞若观火地审视自己半个世纪生活中的那些失误和不当；同时更广阔和透彻地认识了人生的意义——即所谓“知天命”。因此，这样的人就能在这样的时期极好地调整自己，用更宽容、善良、豁达和优雅的态度对待生活。甚至一个恶人，到此年龄真正总结了他的人生，也可能一改前非，而生出对人和世界的慈爱之心。五十岁六十岁实际上是一个人重新开始生活的另一个起点。 \n　　但也有些人一到这个年龄，却变得不可爱了，甚至叫周围的人感到越来越讨厌。这些人到此年龄，便觉得自己的一生已“大势已去”。想过去，尽是遗撼；望未来，满目黄昏，夕阳西下。因此，他们一方面悲观厌世，做出看透了一切、一切都没意思的超然于世的姿态；另一方面又怀着阴暗的心理妒嫉一切年轻的生命——年轻的人，年轻的生活，年轻\n######################\nOutput:",
