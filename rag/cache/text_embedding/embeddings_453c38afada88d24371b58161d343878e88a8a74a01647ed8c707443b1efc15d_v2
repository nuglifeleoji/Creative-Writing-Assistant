It might be argued that a Naib had but protected the honor of his name, avenging the threat to his promised neutrality. But this dead man was Duncan Idaho. No matter the arguments available, no matter the “extenuating circumstances,” nothing could erase such an act. Even were Alia to approve privately, she would be forced to respond publicly in revenge. She was, after all, Fremen. To rule Fremen, she could be nothing else, not even to the smallest degree.\nOnly then did it occur to Stilgar that this situation was precisely what Idaho had intended to buy with his “second death.”\nStilgar looked up, saw the shocked face of Harah, his second wife, peering at him in an enclosing throng. Everywhere Stilgar turned there were faces with identical expressions: shock and an understanding of the consequences.\nSlowly Stilgar drew himself erect, wiped the blade on his sleeve and sheathed it. Speaking to the faces, his tone casual, he said: “Those who'll go with me should pack at once. Send men to summon worms.”\n“Where will you go, Stilgar?” Harah asked.\n“Into the desert.”\n“I will go with you,” she said.\n“Of course you'll go with me. All of my wives will go with me. And Ghanima. Get her, Harah. At once.”\n“Yes, Stilgar... at once.” She hesitated. “And Irulan?”\n“If she wishes.”\n“Yes, husband.” Still she hesitated. “You take Ghani as hostage?”\n“Hostage?” He was genuinely startled by the thought. “Woman...” He touched Idaho’s body softly with a toe. “If this mentat was right, I’m Ghani’s only hope.” And he remembered then Leto’s warning: “Beware of Alia. You must take Ghani and flee.”\nAfter the Fremen, all Planetologists see life as expressions of energy and look for the overriding relationships. In small pieces, bits and parcels which grow into general understanding, the Fremen racial wisdom is translated into a new certainty. The thing Fremen have as a people, any people can have. They need but develop a sense for energy relationships. They need but observe that energy soaks up the patterns of things and builds with those patterns.\n—THE ARRAKEEN CATASTROPHE AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\nt was Tuek’s Sietch on the inner lip of False Wall. Halleck stood in the shadow of the rock buttress which shielded the high entrance to the sietch, waiting for those inside to decide whether they would shelter him. He turned his gaze\noutward to the northern desert and then upward to the grey-blue morning sky. The smugglers here had been astonished to learn that he, an off-worlder, had captured a worm and ridden it. But Halleck had been equally astonished at their reaction. The thing was simple for an agile man who’d seen it done many times.\nHalleck returned his attention to the desert, the silver desert of shining rocks and grey-green fields where water had worked its magic. All of this struck him suddenly as an enormously fragile containment of energy, of life— everything threatened by an abrupt shift in the pattern of change.\nHe knew the source of this reaction. It was the bustling scene on the desert floor below him. Containers of dead sandtrout were being trundled into the sietch for distillation and recovery of their water. There were thousands of the creatures. They had come to an outpouring of water. And it was this outpouring which had set Halleck’s mind racing.\nHalleck stared downward across the sietch fields and the qanat boundary which no longer flowed with precious water. He had seen the holes in the qanat’s stone walls, the rending of the rock liner which had spilled water into the sand. What had made those holes? Some stretched along twenty meters of the qanat’s most vulnerable sections, in places where soft sand led outward into water-absorbing depressions. It was those depressions which had swarmed with sandtrout. The children of the sietch were killing them and capturing them.\nRepair teams worked on the shattered walls of the qanat. Others carried minims of irrigation water to the most needy plants. The water source in the gigantic cistern beneath Tuek’s windtrap had been closed off, preventing the flow into the shattered qanat. The sun-powered pumps had been disconnected. The irrigation water came from dwindling pools at the bottom of the qanat and, laboriously, from the cistern within the sietch.\nThe metal frame of the doorseal behind Halleck crackled in the growing warmth of the day. As though the sound moved his eyes, Halleck found his gaze drawn to the farthest curve of the qanat, to the place where water had reached most impudently into the desert. The garden- hopeful planners of the sietch had planted a special tree there and it was doomed unless the water flow could be restored soon. Halleck stared at the silly, trailing plumage of a willow tree there shredded by sand and wind. For him, that tree symbolized the new reality for himself and for Arrakis.\nBoth of us are alien here.\nThey were taking a long time over their decision within the sietch, but they could use good fighting men. Smugglers always needed good men. Halleck had no illusions about them, though. The smugglers of this age were not the Smugglers who’d sheltered him so many years ago when he’d fled the dissolution of his Duke’s fief. No, these were a new breed, quick to seek profit.\nAgain he focused on the silly willow. It came to Halleck then that the stormwinds of his new reality might shred these smugglers and all of their friends. It might destroy Stilgar with his fragile neutrality and take with him all of the tribes who remained loyal to Alia. They’d all become colonial peoples. Halleck had seen it happen before, knowing the bitter taste of it on his own homeworld. He saw it clearly, recalling the mannerisms of the city Fremen, the pattern of the suburbs, and the unmistakable ways of the rural sietch which rubbed off even on this smugglers’ hideaway. The rural districts were colonies of the urban centers. They’d learned how to wear a padded yoke, led into it by their greed if not their superstitions. Even here, especially here, the people had the attitude of a subject population, not the attitude of free men. They were defensive, concealing, evasive. Any manifestation of authority was subject to resentment—any authority: the Regency’s, Stilgar’s, their own Council...\n| can’t trust them, Halleck thought. He could only use them and nurture their distrust of others. It was sad. Gone was the old give and take of free men. The old ways had been reduced to ritual words, their origins lost to memory.\nAlia had done her work well, punishing opposition and rewarding assistance, shifting the Imperial forces in random fashion, concealing the major elements of her Imperial power. The spies! Gods below, the spies she must have!\nHalleck could almost see the deadly rhythm of movement and countermovement by which Alia hoped to keep her opposition off balance.\nIf the Fremen remain dormant, she'll win, he thought.\nThe doorseal behind him crackled as it was opened. A sietch attendant named Melides emerged. He was a short man with a gourd-like body which dwindled into spindly legs whose ugliness was only accented by a stillsuit.\n“You have been accepted,” Melides said.\nAnd Halleck heard the sly dissimulation in the man’s voice. What that voice revealed told Halleck there was sanctuary here for only a limited time.\nJust until | can steal one of their ‘thopters, he thought.\n“My gratitude to your Council,” he said. And he thought of Esmar Tuek, for whom this sietch had been named. Esmar, long dead of someone’s treachery, would have slit the throat of this Melides on sight.\nAny path which narrows future possibilities may become a lethal trap. Humans are not threading their way through a maze; they scan a vast horizon filled with unique opportunities. The narrowing viewpoint of the maze should appeal only to creatures with their noses buried in sand. Sexually produced uniqueness and differences are the life-protection of the species.\n—THE SPACING GUILD HANDBOOK\nad hy do | not feel grief?” Alia directed the question at\nthe ceiling of her small audience chamber, a room she could cross in ten paces one way and fifteen the other. It had two tall and narrow windows which looked out across the Arrakeen rooftops at the Shield Wall.\nIt was almost noon. The sun burned down into the pan upon which the city had been built.\nAlia lowered her gaze to Buer Agarves, the former Tabrite and now aide to Zia who directed the Temple guards. Agarves had brought the news that Javid and Idaho were dead. A mob of sycophants, aides and guards had come in with him and more crowded the areaway outside, revealing that they already knew Agarves’s message.\nBad news traveled fast on Arrakis.\nHe was a small man, this Agarves, with a round face fora Fremen, almost infantile in its roundness. He was one of the new breed who had gone to water-fatness. Alia saw him as though he had been split into two images: one with a serious face and opaque indigo eyes, a worried expression around the mouth, the other image sensuous and vulnerable, excitingly vulnerable. She especially liked the thickness of his lips.\nAlthough it was not yet noon, Alia felt something in the shocked silence around her that spoke of sunset.\nIdaho should’ve died at sunset, she told herself.\n“How is it, Buer, that you’re the bearer of this news?” she asked, noting the watchful quickness which came into his expression.\nAgarves tried to swallow, spoke in a hoarse voice hardly more than a whisper. “I went with Javid, you recall? And when... Stilgar sent me to you, he said for me to tell you that | carried his final obedience.”\n“Final obedience,” she echoed. “What'd he mean by that?”\n“I don’t know, Lady Alia,” he pleaded.\n“Explain to me again what you saw,” she ordered, and she wondered at how cold her skin felt.\n“Isaw...” He bobbed his head nervously, looked at the floor in front of Alia. “I saw the Holy Consort dead upon the floor of the central passage, and Javid lay dead nearby ina side passage. The women already were preparing them for Huanui.”\n“And Stilgar summoned you to this scene?”\n“That is true, My Lady. Stilgar summoned me. He sent Modibo, the Bent One, his messenger in sietch. Modibo gave me no warning. He merely told me Stilgar wanted me.”\n“And you saw my husband’s body there on the floor?”\nHe met her eyes with a darting glance, returned his attention once more to the floor in front of her before nodding. “Yes, My Lady. And Javid dead nearby. Stilgar told me .. . told me that the Holy Consort had slain Javid.”\n“And my husband, you say Stilgar—”\n“He said it to me with his own mouth, My Lady. Stilgar said he had done this. He said the Holy Consort provoked him to rage.”\n“Rage,” Alia repeated. “How was that done?”\n“He didn’t say. No one said. | asked and no one said.”\n“And that", " Stilgar summoned you to this scene?”\n“That is true, My Lady. Stilgar summoned me. He sent Modibo, the Bent One, his messenger in sietch. Modibo gave me no warning. He merely told me Stilgar wanted me.”\n“And you saw my husband’s body there on the floor?”\nHe met her eyes with a darting glance, returned his attention once more to the floor in front of her before nodding. “Yes, My Lady. And Javid dead nearby. Stilgar told me .. . told me that the Holy Consort had slain Javid.”\n“And my husband, you say Stilgar—”\n“He said it to me with his own mouth, My Lady. Stilgar said he had done this. He said the Holy Consort provoked him to rage.”\n“Rage,” Alia repeated. “How was that done?”\n“He didn’t say. No one said. | asked and no one said.”\n“And that’s when you were sent to me with this news?”\n“Yes, My Lady.”\n“Was there nothing you could do?”\nAgarves wet his lips with his tongue, then: “Stilgar commanded, My Lady. It was his sietch.”\n“I see. And you always obeyed Stilgar.”\n“I always did, My Lady, until he freed me from my bond.”\n“When you were sent to my service, you mean?”\n“| obey only you now, My Lady.”\n“Is that right? Tell me, Buer, if | commanded you to slay Stilgar, your old Naib, would you do it?”\nHe met her gaze with a growing firmness. “If you commanded it, My Lady.”\n“I do command it. Have you any idea where he’s gone?”\n“Into the desert; that’s all | know, My Lady.”\n“How many men did he take?”\n“Perhaps half the effectives.”\n“And Ghanima and Irulan with him!”\n“Yes, My Lady. Those who left are burdened with their women, their children and their baggage. Stilgar gave everyone a choice—go with him or be freed of their bond. Many chose to be freed. They will select a new Naib.”\n“I'll select their new Naib! And it'll be you, Buer Agarves, on the day you bring me Stilgar’s head.”\nAgarves could accept selection by battle. It was a Fremen\nway. He said: “As you command, My Lady. What forces may |\n“See Zia. | can’t give you many ‘thopters for the search. They’re needed elsewhere. But you'll have enough fighting men. Stilgar has defamed his honor. Many will serve with you gladly.”\n“I'll get about it, then, My Lady.”\n“Wait!” She studied him a moment, reviewing whom she could send to watch over this vulnerable infant. He would need close watching until he’d proved himself. Zia would know whom to send.\n“Am | not dismissed, My Lady?”\n“You are not dismissed. | must consult you privately and at length on your plans to take Stilgar.” She put a hand to her face. “l'Il not grieve until you’ve exacted my revenge. Give me a few minutes to compose myself.” She lowered her hand. “One of my attendants will show you the way.” She gave a subtle hand signal to one of her attendants, whispered to Shalus, her new Dame of Chamber: “Have him washed and perfumed before you bring him. He smells of worm.”\n“Yes, mistress.”\nAlia turned then, feigning the grief she did not feel, and fled to her private chambers. There, in her bedroom, she slammed the door into its tracks, cursed and stamped her foot.\nDamn that Duncan! Why? Why? Why?\nShe sensed a deliberate provocation from Idaho. He’d Slain Javid and provoked Stilgar. It said he knew about Javid. The whole thing must be taken as a message from Duncan Idaho, a final gesture.\nAgain she stamped her foot and again, raging across the bedchamber.\nDamn him! Damn him! Damn him!\nStilgar gone over to the rebels and Ghanima with him. lrulan, too.\nDamn them all!\nHer stamping foot encountered a painful obstacle, descending onto metal. Pain brought a cry from her and she peered down, finding that she’d bruised her foot on a metal buckle. She snatched it up, stood frozen at the sight of it in her hand. It was an old buckle, one of the silver-and- platinum originals from Caladan awarded originally by the Duke Leto Atreides | to his swordmaster, Duncan Idaho. She’d seen Duncan wear it many times. And he’d discarded it here.\nAlia’s fingers clutched convulsively on the buckle. Idaho had left it here when... when...\nTears sprang from her eyes, forced out against the great Fremen conditioning. Her mouth drew down into a frozen grimace and she sensed the old battle begin within her Skull, reaching out to her fingertips, to her toes. She felt that she had become two people. One looked upon these fleshly contortions with astonishment. The other sought submission to an enormous pain spreading in her chest. The tears flowed freely from her eyes now, and the Astonished One within her demanded querulously: “Who cries? Who is it that cries? Who is crying now?”\nBut nothing stopped the tears, and she felt the painfulness which flamed through her breast as it moved her flesh and hurled her onto the bed.\nStill something demanded out of that profound astonishment: “Who cries? Who is that...”\nBy these acts Leto II removed himself from the evolutionary succession. He did it with a deliberate cutting action, saying: “To be independent is to be removed.” Both twins saw beyond the needs of memory as a measuring process, that is, a way of determining their distance from their human origins. But it was left to Leto II to do the audacious thing, recognizing that a real creation is independent of its creator. He refused to reenact the evolutionary sequence, saying, “That, too, takes me farther and farther from humanity.” He saw the implications in this: that there can be no truly closed systems in life.\n—THE HOLY METAMORPHOSIS BY HARQ AL-ADA\nhere were birds thriving on the insect life which teemed\nin the damp sand beyond the broken ganat: parrots, magpies, jays. This had been a djedida, the last of the new towns, built on a foundation of exposed basalt. It was abandoned now. Ghanima, using the morning hours to study the area beyond the original plantings of the abandoned sietch, detected movement and saw a banded gecko lizard. There’d been a gila woodpecker earlier, nesting in a mud wall of the djedida.\nShe thought of it as a sietch, but it was really a collection of low walls made of stabilized mud brick surrounded by plantings to hold back the dunes. It lay within the Tanzerouft, six hundred kilometers south of Sihaya Ridge. Without human hands to maintain it, the sietch already was beginning to melt back into the desert, its walls eroded by sandblast winds, its plants dying, its plantation area cracked by the burning sun.\nYet the sand beyond the shattered qanat remained damp, attesting to the fact that the squat bulk of the windtrap still functioned.\nIn the months since their flight from Tabr the fugitives had sampled the protection of several such places made uninhabitable by the Desert Demon. Ghanima didn’t believe in the Desert Demon, although there was no denying the visible evidence of the qanat’s destruction.\nOccasionally they had word from the northern settlements through encounters with rebel spice-hunters. A few ‘thopters—some said no more than six—carried out search flights seeking Stilgar, but Arrakis was large and its desert was friendly to the fugitives. Reportedly there was a search-and-destroy force charged with finding Stilgar’s band, but the force which was led by the former Tabrite Buer Agarves had other duties and often returned to Arrakeen.\nThe rebels said there was little fighting between their men and the troops of Alia. Random depredations of the Desert Demon made Home Guard duty the first concern of Alia and the Naibs. Even the smugglers had been hit, but they were said to be scouring the desert for Stilgar, wanting the price on his head.\nStilgar had brought his band into the djedida just before dark the previous day, following the unerring moisture sense of his old Fremen nose. He’d promised they would head south for the palmyries soon, but refused to put a date on the move. Although he carried a price on his head which once would have bought a planet, Stilgar seemed the happiest and most carefree of men.\n“This is a good place for us,” he’d said, pointing out that the windtrap still functioned. “Our friends have left us some water.”\nThey were a small band now, sixty people in all. The old, the sick, and the very young had been filtered south into the palmyries, absorbed there by trusted families. Only the toughest remained, and they had many friends to the north and the south.\nGhanima wondered why Stilgar refused to discuss what was happening to the planet. Couldn’t he see it? As qanats\nwere shattered, Fremen pulled back to the northern and southern lines which once had marked the extent of their holdings. This movement could only signal what must be happening to the Empire. One condition was the mirror of the other.\nGhanima ran a hand under the collar of her stillsuit and resealed it. Despite her worries she felt remarkably free here. The inner lives no longer plagued her, although she sometimes felt their memories inserted into her consciousness. She knew from those memories what this desert had been once, before the work of the ecological transformation. It had been drier, for one thing. That unrepaired windtrap still functioned because it processed moist air.\nMany creatures which once had shunned this desert ventured to live here now. Many in the band remarked how the daylight owls proliferated. Even now, Ghanima could see antbirds. They jigged and danced along the insect lines which swarmed in the damp sand at the end of the shattered qanat. Few badgers were to be seen out here, but there were kangaroo mice in uncounted numbers.\nSuperstitious fear ruled the new Fremen, and Stilgar was no better than the rest. This djedida had been given back to the desert after its qanat had been shattered a fifth time in eleven months. Four times they’d repaired the ravages of the Desert Demon, then they’d no longer had the surplus water to risk another loss.\nIt was the same all through the djedidas and in many of the old sietches. Eight out of nine new settlements had been abandoned. Many of the old sietch communities were more crowded than they had ever been before. And while the desert entered this new phase, Fremen reverted to their old ways. They saw omens in everything. Were worms increasingly scarce except in the Tanzerouft? It was the judgment of Shai-Hulud! And dead worms had been seen with nothing to say why they died. They went back to desert\ndust swiftly after death, but those crumbling hulks which Fremen chanced upon filled the observers with terror.\nStilgar’s band had encountered such a hulk the previous month and it had taken four days for them to shake off the feeling of evil. The thing had reeked of sour and poisonous putrefaction. Its moldering hulk had been found sitting on top", " water to risk another loss.\nIt was the same all through the djedidas and in many of the old sietches.

The thing had reeked of sour and poisonous putrefaction. Its moldering hulk had been found sitting on top of a giant spiceblow, the spice mostly ruined.\nGhanima turned from observing the qanat and looked back at the djedida. Directly in front of her lay a broken wall which once had protected a mushtamal, a small garden annex. She’d explored the place with a firm dependence upon her own curiosity and had found a store of flat, unleavened spicebread in a stone box.\nStilgar had destroyed it, saying: “Fremen would never leave good food behind them.”\nGhanima had suspected he was mistaken, but it hadn’t been worth the argument or the risk. Fremen were changing. Once they’d moved freely across the bled, drawn by natural needs: water, spice, trade. Animal activities had been their alarm clocks. But animals moved to strange new rhythms now while most Fremen huddled close in their old cave-warrens within the shadow of the northern Shield Wall. Spice-hunters in the Tanzerouft were rare, and only Stilgar’s band moved in the old ways.\nShe trusted Stilgar and his fear of Alia. Irulan reinforced his arguments now, reverting to odd Bene Gesserit musings. But on faraway Salusa, Farad’n still lived. Someday there would have to be a reckoning.\nGhanima looked up at the grey-silver morning sky, questing in her mind. Where was help to be found? Where was there someone to listen when she revealed what she Saw happening all around them? The Lady Jessica stayed on Salusa, if the reports were to be believed. And Alia was a creature on a pedestal, involved only in being colossal while she drifted farther and farther from reality. Gurney Halleck was nowhere to be found, although he was reported seen\neverywhere. The Preacher had gone into hiding, his heretical rantings only a fading memory.\nAnd Stilgar.\nShe looked across the broken wall to where Stilgar was helping repair the cistern. Stilgar reveled in his role as the will-o’-the-desert, the price upon his head growing monthly.\nNothing made sense anymore. Nothing.\nWho was this Desert Demon, this creature able to destroy qanats as though they were false idols to be toppled into the sand? Was it a rogue worm? Was it a third force in rebellion—many people? No one believed it was a worm. The water would kill any worm venturing against a qanat. Many Fremen believed the Desert Demon was actually a revolutionary band bent on overthrowing Alia’s Mahdinate and restoring Arrakis to its old ways. Those who believed this said it would be a good thing. Get rid of that greedy apostolic succession which did little else than uphold its own mediocrity. Get back to the true religion which Muad’Dib had espoused.\nA deep sigh shook Ghanima. Oh, Leto, she thought. /’m almost glad you didn’t live to see these days. I’d join you myself, but I’ve a knife yet unblooded. Alia and Farad’n. Farad’n and Alia. The Old Baron’s her demon, and that can’t be permitted.\nHarah came out of the djedida, approaching Ghanima with a steady sand-swallowing pace. Harah stopped in front of Ghanima, demanded, “What do you alone out here?”\n“This is a strange place, Harah. We should leave.”\n“Stilgar waits to meet someone here.”\n“Oh? He didn’t tell me that.”\n“Why should he tell you everything? Maku?” Harah Slapped the water pouch which bulged the front of Ghanima’s robe. “Are you a grown woman to be pregnant?”\n“I’ve been pregnant so many times there’s no counting them,” Ghanima said. “Don’t play those adult-child games with me!”\nHarah took a backward step at the venom in Ghanima’s voice.\n“You're a band of stupids,” Ghanima said, waving her hand to encompass the djedida and the activities of Stilgar and his people. “I should never have come with you.”\n“You'd be dead by now if you hadn't.”\n“Perhaps. But you don’t see what’s right in front of your faces! Who is it that Stilgar waits to meet here?”\n“Buer Agarves.”\nGhanima stared at her.\n“He is being brought here secretly by friends from Red Chasm Sietch,” Harah explained.\n“Alia’s little plaything?”\n“He is being brought under blindfold.”\n“Does Stilgar believe that?”\n“Buer asked for the parley. He agreed to all of our terms.”\n“Why wasn’t I told about this?”\n“Stilgar Knew you would argue against it.”\n“Argue against... This is madness!”\nHarah scowled. “Don’t forget that Buer is...”\n“He’s Family!” Ghanima snapped. “He’s the grandson of Stilgar’s cousin. | know. And the Farad’n whose blood I'll draw one day is as close a relative to me. Do you think that’ll stay my knife?”\n“We've had a distrans. No one follows his party.”\nGhanima spoke in a low voice: “Nothing good will come of this, Harah. We should leave at once.”\n“Have you read an omen?” Harah asked. “That dead worm we saw! Was that—”\n“Stuff that into your womb and give birth to it elsewhere!” Ghanima raged. “I don’t like this meeting nor this place. Isn’t that enough?”\n“PI tell Stilgar what you—”\n“FIIL tell him myself!” Ghanima strode past Harah, who made the sign of the worm horns at her back to ward off evil.\nBut Stilgar only laughed at Ghanima’s fears and ordered her to look for sandtrout as though she were one of the children. She fled into one of the djedida’s abandoned houses and crouched in a corner to nurse her anger. The emotion passed quickly, though; she felt the stirring of the inner lives and remembered someone saying: “If we can immobilize them, things will go as we plan.”\nWhat an odd thought.\nBut she couldn’t recall who'd said those words.\nMuad’Dib was disinherited and he spoke for the disinherited of all time. He cried out against that profound injustice which alienates the individual from that which he was taught to believe, from that which seemed to come to him as a right.\n—THE MAHDINATE, AN ANALYSIS BY HARQ AL-ADA\nG urney Halleck sat on the butte at Shuloch with his baliset beside him on a spice-fiber rug. Below him the enclosed basin swarmed with workers planting crops. The sand ramp up which the Cast Out had lured worms on a spice trail had been blocked off with a new qanat. Plantings moved down the slope to hold it.\nIt was almost time for the noon meal and Halleck had been on the butte for more than an hour, seeking privacy in which to think. Humans did the labor below him, but everything he saw was the work of melange. Leto’s personal estimate was that spice production would fall soon to a stabilized one-tenth of its peak in the Harkonnen years. Stockpiles throughout the empire doubled in value at every new posting. Three hundred and twenty-one liters were said to have bought half of Novebruns Planet from the Metulli Family.\nThe Cast Out worked like men driven by a devil, and perhaps they were. Before every meal, they faced the Tanzerouft and prayed to Shai-Hulud personified. That was how they saw Leto and, through their eyes, Halleck saw a future where most of humankind shared that view. Halleck wasn’t sure he liked the prospect.\nLeto had set the pattern when he’d brought Halleck and The Preacher here in Halleck’s stolen 'thopter. With his bare\nhands Leto had breached the Shuloch qanat, hurling large stones more than fifty meters. When the Cast Out had tried to intervene, Leto had decapitated the first to reach him, using no more than a blurred sweep of his arm. He’d hurled others back into their companions and had laughed at their weapons. In a demon-voice he’d roared at them: “Fire will not touch me! Your knives will not harm me! | wear the skin of Shai-Hulud!”\nThe Cast Out had recognized him then and recalled his escape, leaping from the butte “directly to the desert.” They’d prostrated themselves before him and Leto had issued his orders. “I bring you two guests. You will guard them and honor them. You will rebuild your qanat and begin planting an oasis garden. One day l'Il make my home here. You will prepare my home. You will sell no more spice, but you will store every bit you collect.”\nOn and on he’d gone with his instructions, and the Cast Out had heard every word, seeing him through fear-glazed eyes, through a terrifying awe.\nHere was Shai-Hulud come up from the sand at last!\nThere’d been no intimation of this metamorphosis when Leto had found Halleck with Ghadhean al-Fali in one of the Small rebel sietches at Gare Ruden. With his blind companion, Leto had come up from the desert along the old spice route, traveling by worm through an area where worms were now a rarity. He’d spoken of several detours forced upon him by the presence of moisture in the sand, enough water to poison a worm. They’d arrived shortly after noon and had been brought into the stone-walled common room by guards.\nThe memory haunted Halleck now.\n“So this is The Preacher,” he'd said.\nStriding around the blind man, studying him, Halleck recalled the stories about him. No stillsuit mask hid the old face in sietch, and the features were there for memory to make its comparisons. Yes, the man did look like the old\nDuke for whom Leto had been named. Was it a chance likeness?\n“You know the stories about this one?” Halleck asked, speaking in an aside to Leto. “That he’s your father come back from the desert?”\n“I’ve heard the stories.”\nHalleck turned to examine the boy. Leto wore an odd stillsuit with rolled edges around his face and ears. A black robe covered it and sandboots sheathed his feet. There was much to be explained about his presence here—how he’d managed to escape once more.\n“Why do you bring The Preacher here?” Halleck asked. “In Jacurutu they said he"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_453c38afada88d24371b58161d343878e88a8a74a01647ed8c707443b1efc15d_v2"}
