防护罩对哭声的隔绝还是有一定效果的，哭声减小了一些，所有人都有种松口气的感觉。除了驾驶员需要继续保持清醒以免巡航出现问题之外，不一会儿的工夫，其他人就都先后进入了梦乡。\n\n    这几天实在是有些太疲倦了，再加上主要工作已经完成，心情一放松下来，自然也很容易进入休息状态，很快，包括蓝潇在内，众人基本就沉沉的睡了过去。\n\n    “哇哇哇……”婴儿哭声持续，他那双漂亮的大眼睛里满含着委屈。\n\n    剩余十分之一的蛋壳同样也被安放在试验台上的另一个护罩内，护罩内隔绝了空气，以真空低温状态保存，以确保它的品质不会改变。等到返回古魂兽研究所之后，再使用大型仪器全方位化验、研究。\n\n    哭声中冥想实在是有点难，而且有走火入魔的危险，所以蓝潇、南澄他们都选择了睡觉。睡的很沉，飞机内也渐渐安静了起来，只有那哭声依旧嘹亮，若隐若现。\n\n    飞行员驾驶着飞机，巡航系统工作正常。离开极北之地后立刻拔升到万米高空平流层巡航，按照这个速度，大约需要七、八个小时，就能返回驻地机场。他们这次的考察之旅也将结束。\n\n    驾驶员打了个哈欠，他也一直在被哭声骚扰啊，也是疲惫的不行了。再次检查了一遍巡航系统以及防护系统，确认没问题之后，他也双眼闭合，渐渐睡了过去。\n\n    现在的魂导侦察飞机都十分先进，就算巡航系统出现故障也会在第一时间报警。更何况，一般是绝不会出现什么问题的。\n\n    飞机内的呼吸声明显平缓起来，当然，那个依旧在大哭不止的小婴儿是个例外。仅存的十分之一蛋壳上，金银花纹若隐若现，这时候也没有人能注意到的是，伴随着小婴儿的哭声，那剩余的蛋壳上光芒闪烁的频率开始出现了细微的变化。\n\n    每当哭声最嘹亮的时候，那金、银色纹路就会变得最为璀璨，而当哭声减弱时，它的光芒就会随之收敛。\n\n    渐渐的，那蛋壳就在和哭声的呼应之中，变得透明起来，而那透明的蛋壳表面，轻微的出现了一些裂痕，刚开始十分细微，但却持续发展。\n\n    “叮”的一声脆响，蛋壳悄然破碎，不是碎成一块块，而是碎成一片齑粉，碎成一道光芒。\n\n    金银双色光晕就那么轻而易举的钻出了防护罩，又钻入了防护罩，当它涌入小婴儿口鼻的时候，哭声\n######################\nOutput:",
