This covert form of warfare primarily involves targeted killings, sabotage, and subterfuge, designed to minimize large-scale destruction while allowing rival houses to settle disputes.  \n\nA notable instance of this conflict occurred between **House Atreides** and **House Harkonnen**, where the two noble houses engaged in a clandestine struggle marked by assassinations and strategic strikes. Rather than open warfare, the War of Assassins allowed them to pursue their vendettas within the bounds of Imperial law, ensuring that broader stability was maintained under the Guild Peace.  \n\nBy operating within these constraints, the War of Assassins exemplifies a controlled yet deadly form of rivalry, balancing the need for political maneuvering with the prohibition against full-scale war.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251758, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 123}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
