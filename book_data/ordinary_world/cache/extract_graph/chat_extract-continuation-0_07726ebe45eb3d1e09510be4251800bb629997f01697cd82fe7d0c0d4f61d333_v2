关键是李登云！登云虽然表面上看来粗粗笨笨，但这人有心计，办事能下手！面子上对人都哈哈一笑，可办事的时候，心象块铁一样硬，说老实话，不是登云撑台，他冯世宽那主任也不好当！ \n　　他真没想到，他一手栽培起来的李登云，现在竟然成了他女婿的对手。 \n　　唉，说来说去，他现在已经没权了。就是和登云挑明谈一次，让他不要和福军作对，登云表面上会说一堆“那怎还能”的哄人话，但背过他徐国强，该怎干还怎干！他知道登云这人哩！ \n　　这样看，他女婿目前的处境很困难了。他知道福军处理许多事都是正确的。但正确的不一定就是时下吃香的。虽说“四人帮”已经打倒了，但颠倒事不一定马上就能再颠倒过来！你不看冯世宽，“四人帮”时候紧跟着跑，现在又积极喊叫着批判“四人帮”哩！ \n　　徐国强想来想去，没有个好办法给他女婿帮点忙。按说，他在原西县当了多年领导，上下左右都很熟悉，应该为福军解点围。但这不是在街上的门市后面买两瓶好酒，只要他开口就能办到。这是政治！而实际上只有一个关键——那就是李登云！可登云现在位置高了，他成了个下台干部，已经没办法这家伙了！ \n　　他突然灵机一动，把田润叶纳到了这“棋盘”上来。他想：这是一步好棋！润叶要是和向前结了婚，那他李登云就成了福军的亲戚，再好意思和福军作对吗？ \n　　对！他竟然多少时没认真朝这方面想！真是老糊涂了！ \n　　徐国强就象一个即将被将死的棋手，突然有了一着起死回生的妙棋，兴奋得从这个墙根下一闪身站了起来。老黑猫不知发生了什么意外，也赶忙站了起来，惊慌地看着它的主人。 \n　　徐国强激动地又点着一锅烟，然后立刻盘算：他要恨快再和润叶谈一次话，千方百计要说服她答应这门亲事！ \n　　这天下午，爱云和晓霞先后都走了，润叶回家来取她的棉大衣。 \n　　好机会！徐国强立刻走到润叶和晓霞住的那孔窑洞里，着急地马上就进入了主题。 \n　　他和蔼地问润叶：“你和向前的事考虑得怎么样了？”润叶见徐大爷又问她这事，只好仍旧回答：“我还没考虑好……” \n　　“这么个事，还考虑一年哩？你听徐大爷一句话！这亲事再好不过了！你千万不敢耽搁。据我知道，人家向前一家人都很着急，现在就等你一句话哩！” \n　　润叶真痛苦。她最近不愿回这个家，就是想躲避他们说这事。想不到她刚踏进家门，这就又来了。不过，这徐大爷一大�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
