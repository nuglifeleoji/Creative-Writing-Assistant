Odrade holds the higher rank as Mother Superior, with Bellonda acting as her subordinate, though their relationship is marked by frequent disagreements and mutual, if reluctant, respect.  \n\nBellonda consistently challenges Odrade’s decisions, particularly regarding ethical dilemmas such as cyborg transformation and the influence of Murbella, whom she views with suspicion. At times, Bellonda’s opposition is so vehement that she even considers Odrade a traitor to the Sisterhood’s principles. Despite these conflicts, she acknowledges Odrade’s authority and supports her in critical duties, including overseeing Murbella’s Agony and analyzing the behaviors of key figures like Duncan Idaho and Murbella.  \n\nTheir collaboration extends to strategic planning against the Honored Matres, with Bellonda managing internal communications and providing detailed reports while Odrade makes final decisions.
