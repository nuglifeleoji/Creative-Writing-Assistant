He is characterized by his dual role as both a farmer and a businessman, having achieved prosperity through his son’s skills, particularly in running a clothing stall at the material exchange meeting. Despite his wealth and influence, which have made him a notable figure in the village, 金俊文's family is also embroiled in a series of troubling issues, including theft and a negative reputation stemming from their actions.\n\n金俊文 is closely related to several family members, including his brothers, 金俊武 and 金俊斌. He is currently grieving the loss of 金俊斌 and is involved in the funeral arrangements, reflecting his deep familial ties. His relationship with 金俊武 is particularly significant; while he tries to support his brother, he also faces disappointment regarding the actions of his sons, 金富 and 金强. 金俊文 feels guilt over their foolish behaviors, which have contributed to the family's struggles.\n\nIn addition to his familial responsibilities, 金俊文 is actively engaged in the community. He is known for his skills in cooking and is responsible for preparing meals for gatherings, such as the celebratory meal for 金二锤. He also plays a role in the village's agricultural activities, being recognized as a skilled expert in digging earth pits and as a pig butcher for local festivities.\n\n金俊文's family is currently facing a difficult situation, including a trial related to theft, which has further complicated their standing in the village. He is anxiously awaiting the arrival of 田海民, indicating his involvement in ongoing events that may affect the family's future. Despite the challenges, he remains a protective figure, particularly towards his son, 金富, who has been missing for six months, and he is also trying to persuade his mother, 金老太太, to relocate to a new house.\n\nOverall, 金俊文 embodies the struggles and complexities of a family caught between prosperity and adversity, navigating the challenges of reputation, familial loyalty, and community expectations in 双水村. His character reflects the intricate web of relationships and responsibilities that define his life and the lives of those around him.\",25\r\n1916,公安人员,\"The term \"\"公安人员\"\" refers to police personnel who play a crucial role in maintaining public order and safety. In the context of recent events, these officers have been dispatched by the city to manage conflicts that have arisen due to the return of displaced villagers. Their involvement is essential in ensuring a peaceful reintegration process and addressing any tensions that may emerge from the situation.\n\nAdditionally, \"\"公安人员\"\" encompasses police officers engaged in the investigation and apprehension of criminals in the area known as 双水村. This highlights their dual responsibilities: not only do they work to resolve community conflicts, but they also actively pursue criminal activities to uphold the law and protect the residents.\n\nOverall, \"\"公安人员\"\" serves as a vital force in both conflict management and law enforcement, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining stability and safety within the community.\",2\r\n808,二小子金强,二小子金强 is 金俊文's second son who helps with heavy work while 金俊文 does lighter tasks.,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1218,金俊武,彩娥,金俊武对彩娥的行为感到愤怒和无能为力，因其与孙玉亭的关系而感到困扰。,63\r\n659,金俊文,金富,\"金俊文 and 金富 are closely linked through familial ties and a complex web of circumstances. 金俊文 is identified as the father of 金富, and his status has notably risen due to the wealth and reputation that his son has garnered. However, this relationship is fraught with tension, as 金俊文 feels a sense of guilt regarding 金富's actions, which have led to a series of criminal activities.\n\n金富 is described as the leader of a theft gang that includes members of 金俊文's family, indicating a troubling connection between their familial bonds and criminal endeavors. This duality complicates 金俊文's feelings towards his son; while he benefits from 金富's skills that have contributed to the family's prosperity, he is also embroiled in the shame and conflict arising from his son's illicit activities.\n\nAdding to the complexity, 金富 has gone missing after leaving the village, which has likely intensified 金俊文's feelings of guilt and concern. The descriptions suggest that 金俊文's role is not only that of a father but also as a participant in a family conflict that has broader implications for their reputation and safety.\n\nIn summary, 金俊文 is a father grappling with the duality of pride and shame regarding his son, 金富, whose leadership in a theft gang has intertwined their fates in both prosperity and criminality.
