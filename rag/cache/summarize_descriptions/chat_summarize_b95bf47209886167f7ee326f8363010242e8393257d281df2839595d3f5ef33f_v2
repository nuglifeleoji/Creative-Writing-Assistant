The Tleilaxu have extensively modified Duncan, though the full extent of these alterations remains unclear, even to the Bene Gesserit, who are typically well-informed about such matters. Among these modifications, Duncan has been implanted with **forbidden knowledge and abilities**, suggesting that the Tleilaxu have enhanced him beyond standard ghola capabilities for purposes yet to be fully revealed.  \n\nThe Tleilaxu have a long-standing arrangement to supply Duncan gholas to **Leto II**, the God Emperor, indicating Duncan's recurring importance in political and genetic schemes. At one point, Duncan is even **disguised as a Tleilaxu Master** to facilitate an escape, demonstrating his role as both a pawn and a key player in their intricate plots.  \n\nWhile the exact nature of the Tleilaxu's modifications to Duncan remains shrouded in secrecy, it is evident that they have imbued him with unique traits, possibly to serve hidden agendas.
