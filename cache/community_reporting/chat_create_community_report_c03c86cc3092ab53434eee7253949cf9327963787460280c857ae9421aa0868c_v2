Originally ruling the oceanic world of Caladan, the house was later assigned by Emperor Shaddam IV to govern Arrakis (Dune), a desert planet vital for its monopoly on the geriatric spice melange—a resource crucial to interstellar travel and the Imperium’s power. Led by the honorable Duke Leto Atreides, the house was renowned for its integrity, military prowess, and popularity among the Landsraad, though it faced fierce rivalry from House Harkonnen and suspicion from the Emperor, who secretly supported its enemies.  \n\nHouse Atreides' relocation to Arrakis was a trap orchestrated by the Harkonnens and the Emperor, culminating in a devastating attack that destroyed the house and killed Duke Leto. However, his son, Paul Atreides, survived and later rose to power among the Fremen, becoming the prophesied leader Muad’Dib. Under Paul’s rule, House Atreides reclaimed dominance over Arrakis and the Imperium, though internal strife and external threats persisted. After Paul’s reign, leadership passed to his sister Alia and later to his children, Leto II and Ghanima, who continued the Atreides legacy amid political and religious turmoil.  \n\nThe house’s history is marked by its conflicts with House Harkonnen, its alliance with House Ginaz, and its complex relationship with the Bene Gesserit. Though temporarily believed extinct, the Atreides line endured through Paul and his descendants, shaping the fate of the universe. Their legacy is defined by honor, resilience, and their deep ties to the Fremen, spice trade, and the broader power struggles of the Imperium.\",53\n3,CALADAN,\"**Caladan** is the lush, water-rich ancestral homeworld of **House Atreides**, known for its jungles, rice paddies, and abundant ecosystems. A planet of great natural beauty, it contrasts sharply with the arid desert of **Arrakis**, serving as a poignant symbol of the Atreides' lost past. Caladan is famed for its exports, including **Pundi Rice**, a mutated rice high in natural sugar, as well as **whale fur** and fine **wine**. It is also the birthplace of **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)**, where he spent his childhood under the care of his mother, **Lady Jessica**, and trained in combat with **Duncan Idaho**.  \n\nBefore their forced relocation to Arrakis, **Duke Leto Atreides** ruled Caladan with **sea and air power**, and the planet was central to the family's heritage, featuring ancient castles and long-standing traditions. After the Atreides' departure, **Gurney Halleck** later governed Caladan as a regent. The planet holds deep sentimental value for its former inhabitants—**Idaho** reminisces about its **sunlit waters** and **sea markets**, while **Jessica** returned there in exile after Paul's death.  \n\nCaladan is referenced in historical toasts, songs, and **Other Memories**, underscoring its cultural significance. Though a paradise of rainstorms, rivers, and **jungle flowers**, it also represents a fallen legacy, now lost to the Atreides. The planet's softer environment, including its famed **vine eucalyptus** and **paradan melon**, stands in stark contrast to the harshness of Arrakis, making it a recurring motif of nostalgia and longing in the Atreides saga.  \n\n(Word count: 249)\",24\n148,SPICE HARVESTING,\"The harvesting of melange, a valuable spice unique to Arrakis, which is central to the economy and politics of the universe\",2\n290,DOCTOR YUEH,\"Doctor Yueh was the true betrayer of House Atreides, though the Baron plans to conceal this from Hawat.\"\"\",1\n403,WARMASTERS,\"Military trainers of House Atreides, including Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho\",1\n674,HARKONNEN WAR,The Harkonnen War refers to the conflict where Paul's father was killed>,1\n988,REGGENCY COUNCIL,\"The Regency Council governs in the name of the Atreides twins.\"\"\",1\n519,MUAHD QURAN,A religious text preserved among the pundi rice farmers of Caladan>,1\n27,CASTLE CALADAN,\"**Castle Caladan** is the ancestral home of House Atreides on the planet Caladan. It served as a significant residence for key members of the Atreides family, including Lady Jessica and her son Paul, before their departure to Arrakis. Known for its peaceful and moist environment, the castle stands as a symbol of the family's legacy and power on Caladan. It was the setting for pivotal events involving Jessica and Paul, underscoring its importance in the political and personal history of House Atreides. The descriptions collectively emphasize its role as both a familial stronghold and a tranquil retreat, reflecting the duality of its significance—both as a seat of governance and a place of personal refuge.\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10,HOUSE ATREIDES,HOUSE HARKONNEN,\"**House Atreides and House Harkonnen** are historic and mortal enemies, locked in a long-standing, bitter feud marked by deep blood vendettas and central to the conflicts of the *Dune* saga. Their rivalry is one of the most intense in the universe, with House Harkonnen harboring a relentless desire to destroy House Atreides, exemplified by their role in the death of Duke Leto Atreides.  \n\nThe Harkonnens previously controlled—and ruled over—the desert planet Arrakis, a position of immense strategic and economic importance due to its production of the spice melange. Their dominance over Arrakis was a key point of contention between the two houses, further fueling their enmity. While the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing—some stating the Harkonnens \"\"recently controlled\"\" Arrakis while others say \"\"previously\"\"—the consensus is clear: House Harkonnen once held power over the planet before their conflict with House Atreides escalated.  \n\nThe feud between the two houses is not merely political but deeply personal, rooted in generations of betrayal, violence, and vengeance. Their clashes are driven by mutual hatred, with House Harkonnen actively seeking the downfall of House Atreides, and House Atreides resisting with equal determination. This animosity defines much of their interactions, making their rivalry one of the most iconic in science fiction.  \n\nIn summary, House Atreides and House Harkonnen are inextricably linked by a vicious, generations-long feud, with control over Arrakis serving as a critical flashpoint in their conflict. Their enmity is relentless, shaping the fate of empires and the broader narrative of the *Dune* universe.\",82\n6,CALADAN,HOUSE ATREIDES,\"**CALADAN and HOUSE ATREIDES**  \n\nCaladan is the ancestral home planet of House Atreides, serving as their primary seat of power before their relocation to Arrakis. A water-rich world, Caladan stands in stark contrast to the arid desert landscape of Arrakis, also known as Dune. House Atreides ruled over Caladan for generations, establishing it as a prosperous and influential fiefdom within the Imperium. The planet's lush environment, abundant with oceans and temperate climates, reflects the noble and disciplined nature of House Atreides, which governed it with fairness and strength.  \n\nThe move to Arrakis marked a significant transition for House Atreides, as they were entrusted with the stewardship of the desert planet and its valuable spice production. Despite this shift, Caladan remains an integral part of their legacy, symbolizing their origins and the values they carried forward. The descriptions uniformly emphasize Caladan's role as the original homeworld of House Atreides, underscoring its importance in their history and identity.  \n\nIn summary, Caladan is a verdant, oceanic planet that was the long-standing dominion of House Atreides before their forced migration to Arrakis. The planet’s natural abundance and the House’s rule over it are central to understanding their heritage and the dramatic changes they later faced.\",77\n276,HOUSE ATREIDES,SPICE HARVESTING,House Atreides now controls the spice harvesting operations on Arrakis,55\n682,HOUSE ATREIDES,DOCTOR YUEH,\"Doctor Yueh betrayed House Atreides, leading to their downfall.\",54\n969,HOUSE ATREIDES,WARMASTERS,Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho trained forces for House Atreides,54\n1440,HOUSE ATREIDES,HARKONNEN WAR,The Harkonnen War resulted in the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis,54\n2219,HOUSE ATREIDES,REGGENCY COUNCIL,The Regency Council governs in the name of the Atreides twins.,54\n1257,MUAHD QURAN,CALADAN,The Muadh Quran is preserved among the pundi rice farmers of Caladan,25\n2256,CASTLE CALADAN,GUILD HEIGHLINER,Guild heighliners provided transportation to and from Castle Caladan,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
