Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded Suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\n“They're certainly dead, Baron,” the man repeated.\nThe Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud’s eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep\nwithin the drug’s rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.\n“I have a full report,” Nefud said.\nLet him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear—sharp and ready.\n“Have you seen their bodies?” the Baron rumbled.\nNefud hesitated.\n“Well?”\n“M’Lord...they were seen to dive into a sandstorm...winds over eight hundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m’Lord. Nothing! One of our own craft was destroyed in the pursuit.”\nThe Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the man’s jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.\n“You have seen the bodies?” the Baron asked.\n“M’Lord—”\n“For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?” the Baron roared. “To tell me a thing is certain when it is not? Do you think lIl praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?”\nNefud’s face went bone pale.\nLook at the chicken, the Baron thought. / am surrounded by such useless clods. If | scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he’d peck at it.\n“The man Idaho led us to them, then?” the Baron asked.\n“Yes, m’Lord!”\nLook how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought. He said: “They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Is there more to this...report?”\n“The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, m’Lord. Idaho joined this Kynes under mysterious circumstances...| might even say suspicious circumstances.”\n“Soe”\n“They...ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it’s apparent the boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement of the chase, several of our groups were caught In a lasgun-shield explosion.”\n“How many did we lose?”\n“l’m...ah, not sure yet, m’Lord.”\nHe’s lying, the Baron thought. /t must’ve been pretty bad.\n“The Imperial lackey, this Kynes,” the Baron said. “He was playing a double game, eh?”\n“I'd stake my reputation on it, m’Lord.”\nHis reputation!\n“Have the man killed,” the Baron said.\n“M'Lord! Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majesty’s own serv—”\n“Make it look like an accident, then!”\n“M'Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now.”\n“Get him away from them. Say | wish to question him.”\n“If they demur?”\n“They will not if you handle it correctly.”\nNefud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“The man must die,” the Baron rumbled. “He tried to help my enemies.”\nNefud shifted from one foot to the other.\n“Well?”\n“M’Lord, the Sardaukar have...two persons in custody who might be of interest to you. They’ve caught the Duke’s Master of Assassins.”\n“Hawat? Thufir Hawat?”\n“I’ve seen the captive myself, m’Lord. ’Tis Hawat.”\n“I'd not’ve believed it possible!”\n“They say he was knocked out by a stunner, m’Lord. In the desert where he couldn’t use his Shield. He’s virtually unharmed. If we can get our hands on him, he'll provide great sport.”\n“This is a Mentat you speak of,” the Baron growled. “One doesn’t waste a Mentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat? Could he know the extent of...but no.”\n“He has spoken only enough, m’Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady Jessica was his betrayer.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h.”\nThe Baron sank back, thinking; then: “You’re sure? It’s the Lady Jessica who attracts his anger?”\n“He said it in my presence, m’Lord.”\n“Let him think she’s alive, then.”\n“But, m’Lord—”\n“Be quiet. | wish Hawat treated kindly. He must be told nothing of the late Doctor Yueh, his true betrayer. Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending his\nDuke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, feed his suspicions against the Lady Jessica.\n“M’Lord, | don’t—”\n“The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information. False information—false results.”\n“Yes, m’Lord, but...”\n“Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?”\n“M’Lord, Hawat’s still in the hands of the Sardaukar!”\n“Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from Hawat as | am. I’ve noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud. They’re not very devious...politically. | do believe this is a deliberate thing; the Emperor wants it that way. Yes. | do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.”\nNefud looked unhappy. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“You will tell the Sardaukar commander that | wish to question both Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other. He can understand that much, I think.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“And once we have them in our hands....” The Baron nodded.\n“M’Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any...questioning.”\n“I’m sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud.”\n“I understand, m’Lord. That’s when Kynes can have his accident.”\nn\n“Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will have a real accident. It’s Hawat | want. Yes. Ah, yes.”\nNefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.\n“Hawat will be given both food and drink,” the Baron said. “Treated with kindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries. And you will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawat’s diet from this point on...unless | say otherwise.”\n“The antidote, yes.” Nefud shook his head. “But—”\n“Don’t be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter. | need a replacement.”\n“Hawat?”\n“Hawat.”\n“But—”\n“You're going to say Hawat’s completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he’s not to blame for the Duke’s demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable Thufir Hawat.”\n“Woo him. Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat’s right. Hawat will see a certain element of\ntruth in this. The Duke couldn’t afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information.” The Baron stared at Nefud. “Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud. The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.”\n“With wealth. Yes, m’Lord.”\n“We will woo Hawat,” the Baron said. “We will hide him from the Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve... the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison. There’s no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never suspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.”\nNefud’s eyes opened wide with understanding.\n“The absence of a thing,” the Baron said, “this can be as deadly as the presence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything else we're addicted to.” The Baron nodded. “You understand me, Nefud?”\nNefud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.”\n“At once, m’Lord.” Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.\nHawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If they suspect anything at all it’s that | wish to destroy the Mentat. And this suspicion l'Il confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they'll toss him to me like some\nsilly toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.\nThe Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his Suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.\nAnd all the Atreides dead!\nThe stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter...or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet...all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor's ears alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.\nPower and fear—fear and power!\nThe Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this Rabban he’d summoned, of course. But Rabban’s younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a Sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed...a ferocity.\nA lovely boy, the Baron thought. A year or two more—say, by the time he’s seventeen, l'Il know for certain whether he’s the tool that House Harkonnen requires to gain the throne.\n“M’Lord Baron.”\nThe man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron’s bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line’s narrow-set eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some\nrigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that he’d come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.\nA muscle\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>The Baron is a powerful and manipulative leader, focused on maintaining control through fear and strategic alliances.
