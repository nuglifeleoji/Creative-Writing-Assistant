\n　　丽丽也走过来，躺在他身边，说：“你冷静点。哭解决什么问题？我们一起谈谈……对你，我一直真诚地爱着。可现在我也真诚的爱古风铃。如果我不说出这一点，那才真是对不起你了。 \n　　“当然，在感情上，你们两个都有权力要求我，但问题是你的确受了伤害。我也不知该怎么办……虽然我知道你无法原谅我，但我还想和你一块生活下去。最少咱们应该试一试，看我们能不能还生活在一起……” \n　　武惠良不哭了。他开口说：“你要试你试吧，反正我没有多少信心。归根结底，对你来说，我将会是多余的人。到目前这种局面，我承认这是必然的。因为你成了诗人，你瞧不起我的工作。我自己永远都成不了什么诗人……既然是这样，你去寻找和你相般配的艺术家去吧！如果我仍然赖着和你在一块，最后不高尚的反而是我了……” \n　　“你在讽刺我，我承认，是我不高尚，从一开始就不高尚……” \n　　“那么，最伟大最光辉最高尚的就只有古风铃了？”他刻毒地讽刺说。 \n　　丽丽不再言传。 \n　　沉默。久久地沉默。 \n　　丽丽酒喝得太多，已经睡着了。 \n　　但武惠良却睡不着。他恨自己太软弱，为什么一再在丽丽面前哭鼻子呢？他即使失去了她，也不能在她面前失去男子汉的尊严！ \n　　他实在是太累了。想睡，但又睡不着。他爬起来，摸进厨房，另外找出一瓶白酒，接连喝了几杯，又回来躺下，还是睡不着，又起来喝了五六杯，倒在床上昏昏然然，仍然没有完全入睡。 \n　　夜，一个彻夜不眠的夜……天亮以后，丽丽出门上班去了。但他却爬不起来，心跳每分钟达到一百几十下。 \n　　他没有按时上班去。 \n　　武惠良灰心丧气地躺在床上，屋顶似乎在头上面旋转——生活的信心粉碎了，崩溃了！ \n　　他昏乱地想，也许人生正如某些人所说，就是一场疯狂的角逐，一切都不过是逢场作戏罢了！既然是这样，也就索性宽容地看待一切，包括宽容地看待自己。为什么要那么认真呢？是的，世界上怕就怕认真二字。他太认真了！人和社会，一切斗争的总结局也许都是中庸而已。与其认真，不如随便，采菊东篱下，悠然见南山；有钱就寻一醉，无钱就寻一睡；与过无争，随遇而安……这样想的时候，他浑身不免冒出一身冷汗。这还象一个团地委书记吗？这是一种彻底的堕落！纯粹的市侩哲学！
