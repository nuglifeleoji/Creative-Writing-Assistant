拉呱起了家常。他东拉西扯，询问她家里的各种情况。小陈是位初中毕业的农村姑娘，刚到他家来，大概因为他是“大官”吧，这孩子一直克服不了拘谨。他想尽量使她很快随便起来，就象自家人一样，比方说，他在家里做错了什么，她也敢批评和纠正他，就象他的小女儿虹虹对他一样。 \n　　当他把第二遍中药掺好凉水重新放在火上后，突然记起了一件事。 \n　　他很快出了厨房，来到电话间，迅速要到了张生民。他让生民通知市委和市上一些部门的负责人，明天早晨上班前都到省委来。他告诉生民地要这些负责同志来干什么。不过他让生民先不要给市上的领导说明。 \n　　明天要做的“文章”，是他刚才在汽车上“构思”的。 \n　　乔伯年打完电话后，先看着让秀英吃完中药，然后自己才开始吃晚饭。 \n　　他还没吃完饭，门铃就响了。他知道，今晚的第一批客人已经登门了。 \n　　小陈领进来的是省委副书记石钟。老石是来和他谈南北几个地区领导班子调配问题的。同来的还有省委组织部长和组织部干部一处的处长，他们见他还端着碗，就劝他吃完饭再说。 \n　　乔伯年一边吃，一边把他们领进会客室，说：“吃着谈着！形象是有点对不起大家，但这是在家里，你们都不是生人嘛！”几个人都和他一起笑了。 \n　　当老石他们给他谈起黄原地区领导班子的考察情况时，提起一个叫田福军的人，说这个干部威信很高，而且很有能力。 \n　　“田福军？”乔伯年停下筷子，瞪住眼睛想了半天，说：“这个人我好象熟悉，但一时又想不起来了……几位管组织的同志谈完情况后，他接着指示他们再做详细的考察工作，以便很快提交省委党委会讨论。 \n　　老石他们告辞后，他家里先后又来了四五批客人。有谈工作的，有反映问题的，也有来告状的。有些是他事先约好的，有些谁知是从什么门道里闯进来的……直到十二点，他才从烟雾腾腾的会客室出来，摇摇晃晃地上了二楼，走进自己的卧室。 \n　　太累了！他躺倒在床上，顾不得和秀英打个招呼，头一挨枕头就迷糊了。他隐约地听见自己在呻吟。他感觉到了那只温热的手关切地放在了他的额头上。他只来得及在心里对老伴说：“我没发烧……”就睡得什么也不知道了。 \n
