As a military representative in the intermediate court's military management committee, she plays a crucial role in the adjudication of 叶文洁's case.

This advocacy suggests that she views 叶文洁's actions as serious offenses that warrant significant consequences.\n\nConversely, 程丽华 also takes on a more supportive role, trying to reassure 叶文洁 that certain documents are not related to her case. This indicates a level of empathy or understanding towards 叶文洁, suggesting that she may recognize the complexities of the situation and the pressures that 叶文洁 faces. Furthermore, 程丽华 attempts to persuade 叶文洁 to sign documents related to her father, which adds another layer to her character, showcasing her involvement in the personal and familial aspects of 叶文洁's life.\n\nOverall, 程丽华 embodies the duality of a military representative who is torn between her duty to enforce the law and her desire to provide support to an individual caught in a difficult predicament.
