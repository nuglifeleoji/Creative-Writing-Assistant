These FACE DANCERS, though terrified, demonstrated bravery as they were organized by LETO to perform in ceremonial events. Their involvement in these performances highlights their dual role as both captives granted temporary freedom and key participants in LETO's orchestrated spectacles. Despite their fear, they carried out their duties, underscoring their significance in the ceremonial and Festive activities under LETO's directive. The combination of amnesty and forced performance paints a complex picture of their relationship with LETOâ€”one of controlled liberation and ceremonial obligation.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the descriptions by presenting the FACE DANCERS as both beneficiaries of LETO's amnesty and performers bound to his will, emphasizing their courage amid apprehension.
