These creatures are both feared and revered, serving as central figures in Fremen culture, religion, and survival.  \n\nShai-Hulud is worshipped by the Fremen as sacred deities, embodying both spiritual significance and ecological necessity. The sandworms are integral to the production of **spice melange**, a substance vital to the Fremen's survival and the broader galactic economy. Beyond their economic role, Shai-Hulud is deeply embedded in Fremen religious practices, with rituals including **blood sacrifices** to honor and appease them.  \n\nThe Fremen view the sandworms as divine manifestations, central to their **theology and way of life**. Their reverence is intertwined with fear, as the creatures are immensely powerful and dangerous. Ecologically, Shai-Hulud maintains the delicate balance of Arrakis’ desert ecosystem, further cementing their indispensability.  \n\nIn summary, the Fremen’s relationship with Shai-Hulud is one of **worship, dependence, and awe**, encompassing cultural, religious, and ecological dimensions.
