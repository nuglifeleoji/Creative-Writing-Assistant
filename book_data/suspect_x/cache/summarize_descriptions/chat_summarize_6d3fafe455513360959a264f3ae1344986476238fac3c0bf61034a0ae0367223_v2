His responsibilities extend beyond mere protection, as he is also involved in critical decision-making processes, demonstrating his importance within Paul's inner circle.  \n\nBannerjee's loyalty and competence are evident in his interactions with key figures such as Chani and Stilgar, who place their trust in him.
