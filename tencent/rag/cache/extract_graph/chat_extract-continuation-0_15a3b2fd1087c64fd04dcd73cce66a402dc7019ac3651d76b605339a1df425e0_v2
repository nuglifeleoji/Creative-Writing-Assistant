Siona and Idaho stood shoulder- to-shoulder in the roadway about twenty meters to Nayla’s right. They were deep in conversation, looking at each other occasionally, nodding.\nPresently, Idaho touched Siona’s arm—an oddly possessive gesture. He nodded once and strode off toward the bridge, stopping at the buttress corner directly in front of Nayla. He peered down, then crossed to the other near corner of the bridge. Again, he peered downward, standing there for several minutes before returning to Siona.\nWhat a strange creature, that ghola, Nayla thought. After that awesome climb, she no longer thought of him as quite human. He was something else, a demiurge who stood next to God. But he could breed.\nA distant shout caught Nayla’s attention. She turned and looked across the bridge. The cortege had been in the familiar trot of a royal peregrination. Now, they were slowing to a sedate walk only a few minutes away from the bridge. Nayla recognized Moneo marching in the van, his uniform brilliant white, the even, undeviating stride with his gaze\nstraight ahead. The cover of the Emperor’s cart had been sealed. It glittered in mirror-opacity as it rolled behind Moneo on its wheels.\nThe mystery of it all filled Nayla.\nA miracle was about to happen!\nNayla glanced to the right at Siona. Siona returned her gaze and nodded once. Nayla drew the lasgun from its holster and rested it against the rock pillar as she sighted along it. The cable on the left first, then the cable on the right, then the faery trellis of plasteel on the left. The lasgun felt cold and alien against Nayla’s hand. She took a trembling breath to restore calm.\nI must obey. It is a test.\nShe saw Moneo lift his gaze from the roadway and, not changing stride, turn to shout something at the cart or the ones behind it. Nayla could not make out the words. Moneo faced front once more. Nayla steadied herself, a part of the rock pillar which concealed most of her body.\nA test.\nMoneo had seen the people on the bridge and at the far end. He identified Fish Speaker uniforms and his first thought was to wonder who had ordered these greeters. He turned and shouted a question at Leto, but the God Emperor’s cart cover remained opaque, hiding Hwi and Leto within it.\nMoneo was onto the bridge, the cart rasping in blown sand behind him, before he recognized Siona and Idaho standing well back from the far end. He identified four Museum Fremen seated on the roadway. Doubts began squirming through Moneo’s mind, but he could not change the pattern. He ventured a glance down at the river—a platinum world there caught in the noonday light. The sound of the cart was loud behind him. The flow of the river, the flow of the cortege, the sweeping importance of these things in which he played a role—all of it caught up his mind in a dizzying sensation of the inevitable.\nWe are not people passing this way, he thought. We are primal elements linking one piece of Time to another. And when we have passed, everything behind us will drop off into no-sound, a place like the no-room of the Ixians, yet never again the same as it was before we came.\nA bit from one of the lute-player’s songs wafted through Moneo’s memory and his eyes went out of focus in the remembrance. He knew that song for its wishfulness, a wish that all of this were ended, all past, all doubts banished, tranquility returned. The plaintive song drifted through his awareness like smoke, twisting and compelling:\n“Insect cries in roots of pampas grass.”\nMoneo hummed the song to himself:\n“Insect cries mark the end. Autumn and my song are the color Of the last leaves\nIn roots of pampas grass.”\nMoneo nodded his head to the refrain:\n“Day is ended, Visitors gone.\nDay is ended.\nIn our Sietch,\nDay is ended. Storm wind sounds. Day is ended. Visitors gone.”\nMoneo decided that the lute-player’s song had to be a really old one, an Old Fremen song, no doubt of it. And it told him something about himself. He wished the visitors truly gone, the excitements ended, peace once more. Peace was so near... yet he could not leave his duties. He thought of all that impedimenta piled out there on the sand\njust beyond visibility range from Tuono. They would see it all soon—tents, food, tables, golden plates and jeweled knives, glowglobes fashioned in the arabesque shapes of ancient lamps... everything rich and full of expectations from completely different lives.\nThey will never be the same in Tuono.\nMoneo had spent two nights in Tuono once on an inspection tour. He remembered the smells of their cooking fires—aromatic bushes kindled and flaming in the dark. They would not use sunstoves because “that is not the most ancient way.”\nMost ancient!\nThere was little smell of melange in Tuono. A sweet acridity and the musky oils of oasis shrubs, these dominated the odors. Yes ... and the cesspools and the stink of rotting garbage. He recalled the God Emperor’s comment when Moneo had finished reporting on that tour.\n“These Fremen do not know what is lost from their lives. They think they keep the essence of the old ways. This is a failure of all museums. Something fades; it dries out of the exhibits and is gone. The people who administer the museum and the people who come to bend over the cases and stare—few of them sense this missing thing. It drove the engine of life in earlier times. When the life is gone, it is gone.”\nMoneo focused on the three Fish Speakers who stood just ahead of him on the bridge. They lifted their arms high and began to dance, whirling and skipping away from him only a few paces distant.\nHow odd, he thought. /’ve seen the other people dance in the open, but never Fish Speakers. They only dance in the privacy of their quarters, in the intimacy of their own company.\nThis thought was still in his mind when he heard the first awful humming of the lasgun and felt the bridge lurch beneath him.\nThis is not happening, his mind told him.\nHe heard the Royal Cart scrape sideways across the roadbed, then the snap-si/ap of the cart’s cover slamming open. A bedlam of screams and cries arose from behind him, but he could not turn. The bridge’s roadbed had tipped steeply to Moneo’s right, spilling him onto his face while he went sliding toward the abyss. He clutched a severed strand of cable to stop himself. The cable went with him, everything grating in the spilling film of sand which had covered the roadbed. He clutched the cable with both hands, turning with it. He saw the Royal Cart then. It skewed sideways toward the edge of the bridge, its cover open. Hwi stood there, one hand steadying her on the folding seat while she stared past Moneo.\nA horrible screaming of metal filled the air as the roadbed tipped even farther. He saw people from the cortege falling, their mouths open, arms waving. Something had caught Moneo’s cable. His arms were stretched out over his head as he turned once more, twisting. He felt his hands, greased by the perspiration of fear, slipping along the cable.\nOnce more, his gaze came around to the Royal Cart. It lay jammed against the stubs of broken girders. Even as Moneo looked, the God Emperor’s futile hands groped for Hwi Noree, but failed to reach her. She fell from the cart’s open end, silently, the golden gown whipping upward to reveal her body stretched out as straight as an arrow.\nA deep, rumbling groan came from the God Emperor.\nWhy doesn’t he activate the suspensors? Moneo wondered. The suspensors will support him.\nBut the lasgun was still humming and, as Moneo’s hands Slipped from the cable’s severed end, he saw lancing flame strike the cart’s suspensor bubbles, piercing one after another in eruptions of golden smoke. Moneo stretched his hands over his head as he fell.\nThe smoke! The golden smoke!\nHis robe whipped upward, turning him until his face was directed downward into the abyss. With his gaze on the depths, he recognized a maelstrom of boiling rapids there, the mirror of his life—precipitous currents and plunges, all movement gathering up all substance. Leto’s words wound through his mind on a path of golden smoke: “Caution is the path to mediocrity. Gliding, passionless mediocrity is all that most people think they can achieve.” Moneo fell freely then in the ecstasy of awareness. The universe opened for him like clear glass, everything flowing in a no-Time.\nThe golden smoke!\n“Leto!” he screamed. “Siaynoq! | believe!”\nThe robe tore away from his shoulders then. He turned in the wind of the canyon—one last glimpse of the Royal Cart tipping .. . tipping from the shattered roadbed. The God Emperor slid out of the open end.\nSomething solid smashed into Moneo’s back—his last sensation.\nLeto felt himself sliding from the cart. His awareness held only the image of Hwi striking the river—the distant pearly fountain which marked her plunge into the myths and dreams of termination. Her last words, calm and steady, rolled through all of his memories: “I shall go on ahead, Love.”\nAs he slipped from the cart, he saw the scimitar arc of the river, a silver-edged thing which shimmered in its mottled shadows, a vicious blade of a river honed through Eternity and ready now to receive him into its agony.\n| cannot cry, nor even shout, he thought. Tears are no longer possible. They're water. l'Il have water enough in a moment. | can only moan in my grief. | am alone, more alone than ever before.\nHis great ridged body flexed as it fell, twisting him about until his amplified vision revealed Siona standing at the broken brink of the bridge.\nNow, you will learn! he thought.\nThe body continued to turn. He watched the river approach. The water was a dream inhabited by glimpses of fish which ignited an ancient memory of a banquet beside a granite pool—pink flesh dazzling his hungers.\n/ join you, Hwi, in the banquet of the gods!\nA bursting flash of bubbles enclosed him in agony. Water, vicious currents of it, buffeted him all around. He felt the gnashing of rocks as he struggled upward to broach ina torrential cascade, his body flexing in a paroxysm of involuntary, writhing splashes. The canyon Wall, wet and black, sped past his frantic gaze. Shattered spangles of what had been his skin exploded away from him, a rain of silver all around him darting away into the river, a ring of dazzling movement, brittle sequins—the scale-glitter of sandtrout leaving him to begin their own colony lives.\nThe agony continued. Leto marveled that he could remain conscious, that he had a body to feel.\nInstinct drove him. He clutched at a rock around which the torrent spilled him, felt a clutching finger torn from his hand before he could release his grip. The sensation of it was only a minor\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SARER<|>GEO<|>The Sareer is a location where the events take place, possibly a desert or significant geographical area in the narrative.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAYLA<|>PERSON<|>Nayla is a character who observes and participates in the events, wielding a lasgun and following orders.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a key figure involved in the events on the bridge, interacting with Nayla and Idaho.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Idaho is a ghola, a clone or recreated person, who plays a significant role in the narrative.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a senior official in the Emperor's cortege, involved in the events leading to the bridge disaster.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The God Emperor is a central figure, a ruler with significant power and influence, who meets his end in the river.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>PERSON<|>Hwi Noree is a companion of the God Emperor, who falls to her death during the bridge collapse.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are a military or ceremonial group associated with the God Emperor.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSEUM FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Museum Fremen are a group preserving ancient Fremen customs and ways.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROYAL CART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Royal Cart is the vehicle transporting the God Emperor and his entourage.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIDGE COLLAPSE<|>EVENT<|>The bridge collapse is a catastrophic event leading to the deaths of several key characters.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAYLA<|>SIONA<|>Nayla follows Siona's orders and interacts with her during the bridge events.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>IDAHO<|>Siona and Idaho are deep in conversation and collaborate during the events.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Moneo serves the God Emperor and is part of his cortege.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>HWI NOREE<|>The God Emperor and Hwi Noree are companions, with the God Emperor grieving her death.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>The Fish Speakers are associated with the God Emperor's regime.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Moneo observes and interacts with the Fish Speakers during the bridge events.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAYLA<|>BRIDGE COLLAPSE<|>Nayla's actions with the lasgun contribute to the bridge collapse.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>BRIDGE COLLAPSE<|>The God Emperor's death is a direct result of the bridge collapse.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>BRIDGE COLLAPSE<|>Hwi Noree dies as a result of the bridge collapse.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>BRIDGE COLLAPSE<|>Moneo dies during the bridge collapse.<|>9\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
