\n　　他看见他哥站在朦胧的月光下，神色很不对头。他紧张地问：“出了什么事？” \n　　“金富和金强把孙玉亭那小子扣在俊斌家里了。”金俊文平静而有些高兴地说。 \n　　一刹那间，金俊武就感到了事态的严重性。他在心里抱怨他哥做事太鲁莽——但嘴里又说不出来。 \n　　“把人打了没？”金俊武先问最主要的事。他怕遭下人命，就得要去吃官司了。 \n　　“没。把外面的门关子挂住了。那小子就在窑里面。俗话说，捉贼捉脏，捉奸捉双。这下看他小子怎么办！”金俊文对他弟说。 \n　　一听还没遭人命，金俊武先松了一口气。但他意识到事态仍然包含着一时都说不清楚的危险性——这种事弄不好很容易出人命！ \n　　他先顾不得说什么，和他哥赶快向俊斌家的院子走去。 \n　　金俊武和他哥进了俊斌家的院子，见中间彩娥住的那孔窑洞，窗户上已经亮起了灯光，里面不断传来彩娥恶毒的叫骂声。两个侄子金富和金强在门外立着，显然不知道该如何处理这事。 \n　　俊武进了院子，用手势示意两个侄子不要出声。他放轻脚步来到彩娥的窗户下，听见弟媳妇在窑里叫骂声不断。不是骂孙玉亭，而是骂他们家的人；甚至把他家祖宗三代翻出来臭骂。他还听见孙玉亭在窑里嘟囔说：“总有个组织哩……” \n　　金俊武一看这情况，就知道事情复杂了。这类事，只要女的不承认，天王老子也没办法。他的心不由“咚咚”地狂跳起来。依他的想法，最好赶快把人放出来再说。可他又知道，他哥和两个侄子肯定不让，说不定先要和他遭一回人命哩！但就这样下去，万一出个什么事，王彩娥或孙玉亭还会反过来咬一口，就象田五的“链子嘴”说的；拿起个狗，打石头，石头反过来咬了个手……金俊武对金富招了招手，示意让大侄子跟他到院子外面去。 \n　　金俊武把金富和俊文一起引出院子，来到院墙外的硷畔上。他对这父子俩说：“既然事情到了这个地步，那就要经组织处理！金富，你先去叫田海民；海民是村里的民兵队长，这事先要报告他。你就对田海民说，孙玉亭深更半夜强奸良家妇女，被你和金强捉住了，让他来处理！” \n　　金富立即遵照二爸的指示，跑到田家圪崂那边叫田海民去了。 \n　　金俊武对他哥说：“咱两个得赶快各回各的家去，假装这事是金富和金强捉住的，咱们不知道。等田海民来了，处理事\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金俊武<|>PERSON<|>金俊武 is a character who is
