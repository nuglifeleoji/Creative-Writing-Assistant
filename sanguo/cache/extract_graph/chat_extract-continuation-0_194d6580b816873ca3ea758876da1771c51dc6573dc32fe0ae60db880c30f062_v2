张鲁大喜，即召庞德至，厚加赏劳；点一万军马，令庞德出。离城十余里，与曹兵相对，庞德出马搦战。曹操在渭桥时，深知庞德之勇，乃嘱诸将曰：“庞德乃西凉勇将，原属马超；今虽依张鲁，未称其心。吾欲得此人。汝等须皆与缓斗，使其力乏，然后擒之。”张郃先出，战了数合便退。夏侯渊也战数合退了。徐晃又战三五合也退了。临后许褚战五十余合亦退。庞德力战四将，并无惧怯。各将皆于操前夸庞德好武艺。曹操心中大喜，与众将商议：“如何得此人投降？”贾诩曰：“某知张鲁手下，有一谋士杨松。其人极贪贿赂。今可暗以金帛送之，使谮庞德于张鲁，便可图矣。”操曰：“何由得人入南郑？”诩曰：“来日交锋，诈败佯输，弃寨而走，使庞德据我寨。我却于夤夜引兵劫寨，庞德必退入城。却选一能言军士，扮作彼军，杂在阵中，便得入城。”操听其计，选一精细军校，重加赏赐，付与金掩心甲一副，今披在贴肉，外穿汉中军士号衣，先于半路上等候。\n\n    次日，先拨夏侯渊；张郃两枝军，远去埋伏；却教徐晃挑战，不数合败走。庞德招军掩杀，曹兵尽退。庞德却夺了曹操寨栅。见寨中粮草极多，大喜，即时申报张鲁；一面在寨中设宴庆贺。当夜二更之后，忽然三路火起：正中是徐晃、许褚，左张郃，右夏侯渊。三路军马，齐来劫寨。庞德不及提备，只得上马冲杀出来，望城而走。背后三路兵追来。庞德急唤开城门，领兵一拥而入。\n\n
