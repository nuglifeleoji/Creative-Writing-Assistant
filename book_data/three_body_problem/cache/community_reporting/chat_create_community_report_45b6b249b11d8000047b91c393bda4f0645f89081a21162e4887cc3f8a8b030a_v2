She actively engages in discussions about this topic and offers the narrator access to valuable computing resources for research. Her involvement in a national key project highlights her significance in the scientific community, where she collaborates with colleagues, including 汪淼 (Wang Miao), and navigates the challenges associated with their work.\n\nShen Yufei's character is also marked by her ideological conflicts, particularly with 潘寒 (Pan Han), with whom she argues about their differing views and the implications of their actions. This tension underscores her role as a critical thinker who is not afraid to voice her opinions. Additionally, she is depicted as a supportive figure, silently backing 汪淼 and providing him with encouragement during moments of uncertainty about the future.\n\nDespite her professional achievements, Shen Yufei's life takes a darker turn when she becomes a victim found at a crime scene, previously seen engaging with a game called 《三体》 (The Three-Body Problem). This incident suggests her involvement in a mysterious situation that intertwines her personal and professional life. Furthermore, she is implicated in a narrative where she is accused of being a traitor by 潘寒, adding layers of complexity to her character.\n\nIn her personal life, Shen Yufei is the wife of 魏成 (Wei Cheng), which adds another dimension to her character as she balances her relationships with her professional responsibilities.
