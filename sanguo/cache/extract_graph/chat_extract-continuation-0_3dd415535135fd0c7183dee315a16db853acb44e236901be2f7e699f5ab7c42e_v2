大夫刘晔谏曰：“今孙权惧蜀兵之势，故来请降。以臣愚见：蜀、吴交兵，乃天亡之也；今若遣上将提数万之兵，渡江袭之，蜀攻其外，魏攻其内，吴国之亡，不出旬日。吴亡则蜀孤矣。陛下何不早图之？”丕曰：“孙权既以礼服朕，朕若攻之，是沮天下欲降者之心；不若纳之为是。”刘晔又曰：“孙权虽有雄才，乃残汉骠骑将军、南昌侯之职。官轻则势微，尚有畏中原之心；若加以王位，则去陛下一阶耳。今陛下信其诈降，崇其位号以封殖之，是与虎添翼也。”丕曰：“不然。朕不助吴，亦不助蜀。待看吴、蜀交兵，若灭一国，止存一国，那时除之，有何难哉？朕意已决，卿勿复言。”遂命太常卿邢贞同赵咨捧执册锡，径至东吴。\n\n    却说孙权聚集百官，商议御蜀兵之策。忽报魏帝封主公为王，礼当远接，顾雍谏曰：“主公宜自称上将军、九州伯之位，不当受魏帝封爵。”权曰：“当日沛公受项羽之封，盖因时也；何故却之？”遂率百官出城迎接。邢贞自恃上国天使，入门不下车。张昭大怒，厉声曰：“礼无不敬，法无不肃，而君敢自尊大，岂以江南无方寸之刃耶？”邢贞慌忙下车，与孙权相见，并车入城。忽车后一人放声哭曰：“吾等不能奋身舍命，为主并魏吞蜀，乃令主公受人封爵，不亦辱乎！”众视之，乃徐盛也。邢贞闻之，叹曰：“江东将相如此，终非久在人下者也！”却说孙权受了封爵，众文武官僚拜贺已毕，命收拾美玉明珠等物，遣人赍进谢恩。早有细作报说蜀主引本国大兵，及蛮王沙摩柯番兵数万，又有洞溪汉将杜路、刘宁二枝兵，水陆并进，声势震天。水路军已出巫口，旱路军已到秭归。时孙权虽登王位，奈魏主不肯接应，乃问文武曰：“蜀兵势大，当复如何？”众皆默然。权叹曰：“周郎之后有鲁肃，鲁肃之后有吕蒙，今吕蒙已亡，无人与孤分忧也！”言未毕，忽班部中一少年将，奋然而出，伏地奏曰：“臣虽年幼，颇习兵书。愿乞数万之兵，以破蜀兵。”权视之，乃孙桓也。桓字叔武，其父名河，本姓俞氏，孙策爱之，赐姓孙，因此亦系吴�\n######################\nOutput:",
