Odrade’s interpretation of that message in the stones of Rakis conveyed an old warning:\nThis, too, shall pass away.\nAre we to end now, crushed by ravenous hordes from the Scattering?\nBut the secret of the axlotl tanks was almost within the Sisterhood’s grasp.\nIf we gain that, nothing can stop us!\nTaraza swung her gaze around the details of her room. The Bene Gesserit power was still here. Chapter House remained concealed behind a moat of no-ships, its location unrecorded except in the minds of her own people. Invisibility.\nTemporary invisibility! Accidents occurred.\nTaraza squared her shoulders. Take precautions but don’t live in their shadows, constantly furtive. The Litany Against Fear served a useful purpose when avoiding shadows.\nFrom anyone but Odrade, the warning message with its disturbing implications that the Tyrant still guided his Golden Path would have been far less fearsome.\nThat damnable Atreides talent!\n“No more than a secret society?”\nTaraza gritted her teeth in frustration.\n“Memories are not enough unless they call you to noble purpose!”\nAnd what if it was true that the Sisterhood no longer heard the music of life?\nDamn him! The Tyrant could still touch them.\nWhat is he trying to tell us? His Golden Path could not be in peril. The Scattering had seen to that. Humans had spread their kind outward on uncounted courses like the spines of a hedgehog.\nHad he seen a vision of the Scattered Ones returning? Could he possibly have anticipated this bramble patch at the foot of his Golden Path?\nHe knew we would suspect his powers. He knew it!\nTaraza thought about the mounting reports of the Lost Ones who were returning to their roots. A remarkable diversity of people and artifacts accompanied by a remarkable degree of secrecy and wide evidence of conspiracy. No-ships of a peculiar design, weapons and artifacts of breathtaking sophistication. Diverse peoples and diverse ways.\nSome, astonishingly primitive. At least on the surface.\nAnd they wanted much more than melange. Taraza recognized the peculiar form of mysticism that drove the Scattered Ones back: “We want your elder secrets!”\nThe message of the Honored Matres was clear enough, too: “We will take what we want.”\nOdrade has it all right in her hands, Taraza thought. She had Sheeana. Soon, if Burzmali succeeded, she would have the ghola. She had the Tleilaxu Master of Masters. She could have Rakis itself!\nIf only she were not an Atreides.\nTaraza glanced at the projected words still dancing above her tabletop: a comparison of this newest Duncan Idaho with all of the slain ones. Each new ghola had been slightly different from its predecessors. That was clear enough. The Tleilaxu were perfecting something. But what? Was the clue hidden in these new Face Dancers? The Tleilaxu obviously sought an undetectable Face Dancer, mimics whose mimicry\nreached perfection, shape-copiers who copied not only the\nsurface memories of their victims but the deepest thoughts and identity as well. It was a form of immortality even more enticing than the one the Tleilaxu Masters used at present.\nThat obviously was why they followed this course.\nHer own analysis agreed with the majority of her advisors: Such a mimic would become the copied person. Odrade’s reports on the Face Dancer-Tuek were highly suggestive. Even the Tleilaxu Masters might not be able to Shake such a Face Dancer out of its mimic shape and behavior.\nAnd its beliefs.\nDamn Odrade! She had painted her Sisters into a corner. They had no choice except to follow Odrade’s lead and Odrade knew it!\nHow did she know it? Was it that wild talent again?\n| cannot act blindly. | must know.\nTaraza went through the well-remembered regimen to restore a sense of calm. She dared not make momentous decisions in a frustrated mood. A long look at the statuette of Chenoeh helped. Lifting herself from the chairdog, Taraza returned to her favorite window.\nIt often soothed her to stare out at this landscape, observing how the distances changed with the daily movement of sunlight and shifts in the planet’s well- managed weather.\nHunger prodded her.\nI| will eat with the acolytes and lay Sisters today.\nIt helped at times to gather the young around her and remember the persistence of the eating rituals, the daily timing—morning, noon, and evening. That formed a reliable cement. She enjoyed watching her people. They were like a tide speaking of deeper things, of unseen forces and greater powers that persisted because the Bene Gesserit had found the ways of flowing with that persistence.\nThese thoughts renewed Taraza’s balance. Nagging questions could be placed temporarily at a distance. She could look at them without passion.\nOdrade and the Tyrant were right: Without noble purpose we are nothing.\nOne could not escape, though, the fact that critical decisions were being made on Rakis by a person who suffered from those recurring Atreides flaws. Odrade had always displayed typical Atreides weakness. She had been positively benevolent to erring acolytes. Affections developed out of such behavior!\nDangerous and mind-clouding affections.\nThis weakened others, who then were required to compensate for such laxity. More competent Sisters were called upon to take erring acolytes in hand and correct the weaknesses. Of course, Odrade’s behavior had exposed these flaws in acolytes. One must admit this. Perhaps Odrade reasoned thus.\nWhen she thought this way, something subtle and powerful shifted in Taraza’s perceptions. She was forced to put down a deep sense of loneliness. It rankled. Melancholy could be quite as mind-clouding as affection... or even love. Taraza and her watchful Memory Sisters ascribed such emotional responses to awareness of mortality. She was forced to confront the fact that one day she would be no more than a set of memories in someone else’s living flesh.\nMemories and accidental discoveries, she saw, had made her vulnerable. And just when she needed every available faculty!\nBut I am not yet dead.\nTaraza knew how to restore herself. And she knew the consequences. Always after these bouts of melancholy she regained an even firmer grip on her life and its purposes. Odrade’s flawed behavior was a source of her Mother Superior’s strength.\nOdrade knew it. Taraza smiled grimly at this awareness. The Mother Superior’s authority over her Sisters always became stronger when she returned from melancholy. Others had observed this but only Odrade knew about the rage.\nThere!\nTaraza realized that she had confronted the distressful seeds of her frustration.\nOdrade had clearly recognized on several occasions what sat at the core of the Mother Superior’s behavior. A giant howl of rage against the uses others had made of her life. The power of that suppressed rage was daunting even though it could never be expressed in a way that vented it. That rage must never be allowed to heal. How it hurt! Odrade’s awareness made the pain even more intense.\nSuch things did what they were supposed to do, of course. Bene Gesserit impositions developed certain mental muscles. They built up layers of callousness that could never be revealed to outsiders. Love was one of the most dangerous forces in the universe. They had to protect themselves against it. A Reverend Mother could never become intimately personal, not even in the services of the Bene Gesserit.\nSimulation: We play the necessary role that saves us. The Bene Gesserit will persist!\nHow long would they be subservient this time? Another thirty-five hundred years? Well, damn them all! It would still be only a temporary thing.\nTaraza turned her back on the window and its restorative view. She did feel restored. New strength flowed into her. There was strength enough to overcome that gnawing reluctance which had kept her from making the essential decision.\n/ will go to Rakis.\nShe no longer could evade the source of her own reluctance.\n| may have to do what Bellonda wants.\nSurvival of self, of species, and of environment, these are what drive humans. You can observe how the order of importance changes in a lifetime. What are the things of immediate concern at a given age? Weather? The state of the digestion? Does she (or he) really care? All of those various hungers that flesh can sense and hope to satisfy. What else could possibly matter?\n—LETO II TO HWI NOREE, HIS VOICE: DAR-ES-BALAT\nMI iles Teg awoke in darkness to find himself being carried on a litter sling supported by suspensors. By their faint energy glow, he could see the tiny suspensor bulbs in an updangling row around him.\nThere was a gag in his mouth. His hands were securely tied behind his back. His eyes remained uncovered.\nSo they don’t care what I see.\nWho they were he could not tell. The bobbing motions of the dark shapes around him suggested they were descending uneven terrain. A trail? The litter sling rode smoothly on its suspensors. He could sense the faint humming from the suspensors when his party stopped to negotiate the turn of a difficult passage.\nNow and then through some intervening obstruction, he saw the flickering of a light ahead. They entered the lighted area presently and stopped. He saw a single glowglobe about three meters off the ground, tethered on a pole and moving gently in a cold breeze. By its yellow glow he discerned a shack in the center of a muddy clearing, many tracks in trampled snow. He saw bushes and a few sparse trees around the clearing. Someone passed a brighter handlight across his face. Nothing was said but Teg saw a hand gesture toward the shack. He had seldom seen such a\ndilapidated structure. It looked ready to collapse at the slightest touch. He bet himself that the roof leaked.\nOnce more, his party lurched into motion, swinging him toward the shack. He studied his escort in the dim light— faces muffled to the eyes in a cover that obscured mouths and chins. Hoods hid their hair. The clothing was bulky and concealed body details except for the general articulation of arms and legs.\nThe pole-tethered glowglobe went dark.\nA door opened in the shack, sending a brilliant glare across the clearing. His escort hustled him inside and left him there. He heard the door close behind them.\nIt was almost blindingly bright inside after the darkness. Teg blinked until his eyes adapted to the change. With an odd sense of displacement, he looked around him. He had expected the shack’s interior to match its exterior but here was a neat room almost bare of furnishings—only three chairs, a small table and... he drew in a sharp breath: an Ixian Probe! Couldn’t they smell the shere on his breath?\nIf they were that unaware, let them use the probe. It would be agony for him but they would get nothing from his mind.\nSomething clicked behind him and he heard motion. Three people came into his field of vision and ranged themselves around the foot of the litter. They stared at him silently. Teg moved his attention across the three. The one on his left wore a dark singlesuit with open lapels. Male. He had the squarish face Teg had seen on some Gammu natives—small, beady eyes that stared straight through Teg. It was the face of an inquisitor, one who would not be moved by your agony. The Harkonnens had imported a lot of those in their day. Single-purpose types who could create pain without the slightest change of expression.\nThe one directly at Teg’s feet wore bulky clothing of black and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, focused on political manipulation and genetic breeding programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, a leader who struggles with emotional and strategic decisions, particularly concerning Odrade and the Tyrant's legacy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother with Atreides lineage, known for her benevolence and strategic insights, currently handling critical missions on Rakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is a desert planet, formerly known as Arrakis, central to the Bene Gesserit's plans and the Tyrant's Golden Path)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>The Scattering refers to the mass migration of humans away from the known universe, leading to diverse and advanced civilizations returning with unknown motives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is the Tyrant Leto II's long-term plan to ensure humanity's survival, involving enforced diversity and resilience against stagnation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and dominant faction returning from the Scattering, seeking to conquer and control the Bene Gesserit's secrets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLIELAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and genetically advanced society, known for creating gholas and Face Dancers, with their own agenda in the Bene Gesserit's plans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a key figure on Rakis, possibly connected to the sandworms and the Bene Gesserit's plans for the planet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURZMALI<|>PERSON<|>Burzmali is a Bene Gesserit operative tasked with securing the ghola, a clone of Duncan Idaho, for the Sisterhood's purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a recurring ghola, a clone with each iteration showing slight differences, central to the Bene Gesserit's and Tleilaxu's experiments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACE DANCERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Face Dancers are shape-shifting agents created by the Tleilaxu, capable of mimicking others perfectly, now evolving into undetectable mimics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTER HOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapter House is the hidden and heavily defended base of the Bene Gesserit, protected by no-ships and secrecy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the sisterhood with strategic and emotional challenges<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, handling critical missions and displaying Atreides traits that influence her decisions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>ODRADE<|>Taraza and Odrade have a complex relationship, with Taraza relying on Odrade's insights but wary of her Atreides weaknesses<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>RAKIS<|>Odrade is currently on Rakis, managing critical Bene Gesserit operations and interacting with Sheeana and the ghola<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>TLIELAXU<|>The Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu are engaged in a tense alliance, with the Sisterhood seeking control over Tleilaxu creations like gholas and Face Dancers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit are in conflict with the Honored Matres, who seek to dominate and take the Sisterhood's secrets<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>SCATTERING<|>The Golden Path led to the Scattering, ensuring humanity's survival by forcing diversity and resilience<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLIELAXU<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola created by the Tleilaxu, with each iteration showing slight improvements and unknown purposes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FACE DANCERS<|>TLIELAXU<|>Face Dancers are creations of the Tleilaxu, evolving into perfect mimics under the Masters' direction<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>RAKIS<|>Sheeana is a central figure on Rakis, possibly connected to the sandworms and the planet's ecological transformation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BURZMALI<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Burzmali is tasked with securing the ghola of Duncan Idaho for the Bene Gesserit's plans<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
