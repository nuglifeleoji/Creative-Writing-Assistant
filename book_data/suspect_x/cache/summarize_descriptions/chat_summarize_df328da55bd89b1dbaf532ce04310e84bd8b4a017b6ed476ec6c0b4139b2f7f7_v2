It is known for its strict adherence to preserving ancient Tleilaxu language, traditions, and beliefs, resisting external influences and maintaining its doctrines without alteration. The group wields considerable power, operating with a level of secrecy that underscores its enigmatic nature.  \n\nRecently, the Shariat has been thrown into turmoil following the death of **Tuek**, a significant event that has disrupted its internal stability. Despite this upheaval, the organization remains steadfast in its commitment to its foundational principles, continuing to uphold its religious and cultural mandates. The Shariat's resilience in the face of crisis highlights its enduring role as a guardian of Tleilaxu orthodoxy, even as it navigates periods of uncertainty.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its current instability, others underscore its unwavering conservatism and influence. Together, these portrayals depict the Shariat as a formidable yet internally complex entity, balancing tradition with the challenges of leadership transitions.
