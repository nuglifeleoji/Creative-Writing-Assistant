There was Teg on Streggi’s shoulders. He took a moment to stare up at the façade confronting them about half a klick away. She chose a projection that looked where he looked. Motion behind windows there.\nWhere were the mysterious last-ditch weapons Honored Matres were supposed to possess?\nWhat will he do now?\nTeg had lost his Command Pod to a laser hit outside the main engagement area. The pod lay on its side behind him and he sat astride Streggi’s shoulders in a patch of screening bushes, some still smoldering. He had lost his comboard with the pod but retained the silvery horseshoe of his comlink, although it was crippled without the pod’s amplifiers. Communications specialists crouched nearby, jittering because they had lost close contact with the action.\nThe battle beyond the buildings grew louder. He heard hoarse shouts, the high hissing of burners and the lower buzz of large lasguns mingled with tinny zip-zips of hand weapons. Somewhere off there to his left was a thrum- thrum he recognized as heavy armor in trouble. A scraping sound with it, metal agony. Energy system damaged in that one. It was dragging itself over the ground, probably making a mess of the gardens.\nHaker, Teg’s personal aide, came dodging down the lane behind the Bashar.\nStreggi noticed him first and turned without warning, forcing Teg to look at the man. Haker, dark and muscular, with heavy eyebrows (sweat-dampened now) stopped directly in front of Teg and spoke before fully regaining his breath.\n“We have the last pockets bottled up, Bashar.”\nHaker raised his voice to override the battle sounds and a buzzing squawker over his left shoulder producing low conversations, battle urgency in clipped tones.\n“The far perimeter?” Teg demanded.\n“Mop up in half an hour, no more. You should get out of here, Bashar. Mother Superior warned us to keep you out of needless danger.”\nTeg gestured at his useless pod. “Why don’t! have a Communications backup?”\n“A big laze got both backups in the same burn as they were coming in.”\n“They were together?”\nHaker heard the anger. “Sir, they were...”\n“No important equipment is sent in together. l'II want to know who disobeyed orders.” The quiet voice from immature vocal cords carried more menace than a shout.\n“Yes, Bashar.” Strictly obedient and no sign from Haker that the mistake was his own.\nDamn! “How soon will replacements arrive?”\n“Five minutes.”\n“Get my reserve pod in here as fast as you can.” Teg touched Streggi’s neck with a knee.\nHaker spoke before she could turn. “Bashar, they got the reserve, too. I’ve ordered another.”\nTeg repressed a sigh. These things happened in battle but he didn’t like depending on primitive coms. “We'll set up here. Get more squawkers.” They, at least, had the range.\nHaker glanced at the greenery around them. “Here?”\n“I don’t like the look of those buildings up ahead. That tower commands this area. And they must have underground access. | would.”\n“There’s nothing on the...”\n“My memory layout doesn’t include that tower. Get sonics in here to check the ground. | want our plan brought up to the minute with secure information.”\nHaker’s squawker came alive with an override voice: “Bashar! Is the Bashar available?”\nStreggi moved him next to Haker without being told. Teg took the squawker, whistling his code as he grabbed it.\n“Bashar, it’s a mess at the Flat. About a hundred of them tried to lift and ran into our screen. No survivors.”\n“Any sign of Mother Superior or her Spider Queen?”\n“Negative. We can’t tell. | mean it’s a real mess. Shall | screen a view?”\n“Get me a dispatch. And keep looking for Odrade!”\n“| tell you nothing survived here, Bashar.” There was a click and a low hum, then another voice: “Dispatch.”\nTeg brought his voice-print coder from beneath his chin and barked quick orders. “Scramble a hammership over the Citadel. Put the scene at the Landing Flat and their other disasters on open relay. All bands. Make sure they can see it. Announce no survivors at the Flat.”\nThe double click of received-confirmed broke the link. Haker said: “Do you really think you can terrify them?”\n“Educate them.” He repeated Odrade’s parting words: “Their education has been sadly neglected.”\nWhat had happened to Odrade? He felt sure she must be dead, perhaps the first casualty here. She had expected that. Dead but not lost if Murbella could restrain her impetuosity.\nOdrade, at that moment, had Teg in direct sight from the tower. Logno had silenced her vital signs transmissions with a countersignal shield and had brought her to the tower Shortly after the arrival of the first refugees from Gammu.\nNo one questioned Logno’s supremacy. A dead Great Honored Matre and a live one could only be something familiar.\nExpecting to be killed at any moment, Odrade still gathered data as she went up in a nulltube with guards. The tube was an artifact from the Scattering, a transparent piston in a transparent cylinder. Few obstructing walls at the floors they passed. Mostly views of living areas and esoteric hardware Odrade surmised had military purposes. Lush evidence of comfort and quiet increased the higher they went.\nPower climbs physically as well as psychologically.\nHere they were at the top. A section of the tube cylinder swung outward and a guard pushed her roughly onto a thickly carpeted floor.\nThe workroom Dama showed me down there was another set piece.\nOdrade recognized secrecy. Equipment and furnishings here would have been almost unrecognizable were it not for Murbella’s knowledge. So other action centers were for show. Potemkin villages built for Reverend Mother.\nLogno lied about Dama’s intentions. | was expected to leave unharmed... carrying no useful information.\nWhat other lies had they paraded in front of her?\nLogno and all but one guard went to a console on Odrade’s right. Pivoting on one foot, Odrade looked around. This was the real center. She studied it with care. Odd place. An aura of the sanitary. Treated with chemicals to make it clean. No bacterial or viral contaminants. No strangers in the blood. Everything debugged like a showcase for rare viands. And Dama showed interest in Bene Gesserit immunity to diseases. There was bacterial warfare in the Scattering.\nThey want one thing from us!\nAnd just one surviving Reverend Mother would satisfy them if they could wrest information from her.\nA full Bene Gesserit cadre would have to examine the strands of this web and see where they led.\nIf we win.\nThe operations console where Logno concentrated her attention was smaller than the showcase ones. Fingerfield manipulation. The hood on a low table beside Logno was smaller and transparent, revealing the medusa tangle of probes.\nShigawire for sure.\nThe hood showed a close affinity to T-probes from the Scattering Teg and others had described. Did these women possess more technological marvels? They must.\nA glittering wall behind Logno, windows on her left opening onto a balcony, a far vista of Junction visible out there with movement of troops and armor. She recognized Teg in the distance, a figure on the shoulders of an adult, but gave no sign she saw anything extraordinary. She continued her slow study. Door to a passage with another nulltube partly visible in a separate area to her immediate left. More green tile on the floor there. Different functions in that space.\nA sudden burst of noises erupted beyond the wall. Odrade identified some of them. Boots of soldiers made a distinctive sound on tiles. Swish of exotic fabrics. Voices. She distinguished accents of Honored Matres responding to each other in tones of shock.\nWe're winning!\nShock was to be expected when the invincible were brought low. She studied Logno. Would it be a plunge into despair?\nIf so, | may survive.\nMurbella’s role might be changed. Well, that could wait. Sisters had been briefed on what to do in the event of victory. Neither they nor anyone else in the attack force would lay rough hands on an Honored Matre—erotic or\notherwise. Duncan had prepared the men, making the perils of sexual entrapment thoroughly known.\nRisk no bondage. Raise no new antagonisms.\nThe new Spider Queen was revealed now as someone even stranger than Odrade had suspected. Logno left her console and came to within a pace of Odrade. “You have won this battle. We are your prisoners.”\nNo orange in her eyes. Odrade swept her gaze around at the women who had been her guards. Blank expressions, clear eyes. Was this how they showed despair? It did not feel right. Logno and the others revealed no expected emotional responses.\nEverything under wraps?\nEvents of the past hours should create emotional crisis. Logno gave no sign of it. Not a twitch of revealing nerve or muscle. Perhaps a casual concern and that was all.\nA Bene Gesserit mask!\nIt had to be unconscious, something automatic ignited by defeat. So they did not really accept defeat.\nWe are still in there with them. Latent... but there! No wonder Murbella almost died. She was confronting her own genetic past as a supreme prohibition.\n“My companions,” Odrade said. “The three women who came with me. Where are they?”\n“Dead.” Logno’s voice was as dead as the word.\nOdrade suppressed a pang for Suipol. Tam and Dortujla had lived long and useful lives, but Suipol... dead and never Shared.\nAnother good one lost. And isn’t that a bitter lesson!\n“I will identify the ones responsible if you desire revenge,” Logno said.\nLesson two.\n“Revenge is for children and the emotionally retarded.”\nA small return of orange in Logno’s eyes.\nHuman self-delusion took many forms, Odrade reminded herself. Aware that the Scattering would produce the\nunexpected, she had armed herself accordingly with a protective remoteness that would allow her a space to assess new places, new things and new people. She had known she would be forced to put many things in different categories to serve her or deflect threats. She took Logno’s attitude as a threat.\n“You do not seem disturbed, Great Honored Matre.”\n“Others will avenge me.” Flat, very self-composed.\nThe words were even stranger than her composure. She held everything under that close cover, bits and pieces revealed now in flickering movements aroused by Odrade’s observation. Deep and intense things, but buried. It was all inside there, masked the way a Reverend Mother would mask it. Logno appeared to have no power at all and yet she spoke as though nothing essential had changed.\n“Lam your captive but that makes no difference.”\nWas she truly powerless? No/ But that was the impression she wished to convey and all of the other Honored Matres around her mirrored this response.\n“See us? Powerless except for the loyalty of our Sisters and the followers they have bonded to us.”\nWere Honored Matres that confident of their vengeful legions? Possible only if they had never before suffered a defeat of this kind. Yet someone had driven them back into the Old Empire. Into the Million Planets.\nTeg found Odrade and her captives while seeking a place to assess victory. Battle always required its analytical aftermath, especially from a Mentat commander. It was a comparison test this battle demanded of him more", " observation. Deep and intense things, but buried. It was all inside there, masked the way a Reverend Mother would mask it.

Into the Million Planets.\nTeg found Odrade and her captives while seeking a place to assess victory. Battle always required its analytical aftermath, especially from a Mentat commander. It was a comparison test this battle demanded of him more than any other in his experience. This conflict would not be lodged in memory until assessed and shared as far as possible among those who depended on him. It was his invariable pattern and he did not care what it revealed about him. Break that link of interlocking interests and you prepared yourself for defeat.\n| need a quiet place to assemble the threads of this battle and make a preliminary summary.\nIn his estimation, a most difficult problem of battle was to conduct it in a way that did not release human wildness. A Bene Gesserit dictum. Battle must be conducted to bring out the best in those who survived. Most difficult and sometimes all but impossible. The more remote the soldier from carnage, the more difficult. It was one reason Teg always tried to move to the battle scene and examine it personally. If you did not see the pain, you could easily cause greater pain without second thoughts. That was the Honored Matre pattern. But their pains had been brought home. What would they make of this?\nThat question was in his mind as he and aides emerged from the tube to see Odrade confronting a party of Honored Matres.\n“Here is our commander, the Bashar Miles Teg,” Odrade said, gesturing.\nHonored Matres stared at Teg.\nA child riding on the shoulders of an adult? This is their commander?\n“Ghola,” Logno muttered.\nOdrade spoke to Haker. “Take these prisoners somewhere nearby where they can be comfortable.”\nHaker did not move until Teg nodded, then politely indicated that captives should precede him into the tiled area on their left. Teg’s dominance was not lost on Honored Matres. They glowered at him as they obeyed Haker’s invitation.\nMen ordering women about!\nWith Odrade beside him, Teg touched a knee to Streggi’s neck and they went onto the balcony. There was an oddity to the scene that he was a moment identifying. He had viewed many battle scenes from high vantages, most often from a scout ‘thopter. This balcony was fixed in space, giving him a sense of immediacy. They stood about one\nhundred meters above the botanical gardens where much of the fiercest conflict had taken place. Many bodies lay sprawled in final dislodgment—dolls thrown aside by departing children. He recognized uniforms of some of his troops and felt a pang.\nCould | have done something to prevent this?\nHe had known this feeling many times and called it “Command Guilt.” But this scene was different, not just in that uniqueness found in any battle but in a way that nagged at him. He decided it was partly the landscaped setting, a place better suited to garden parties, now torn by an ancient pattern of violence.\nSmall animals and birds were returning, nervously furtive after the upset of all that noisy human intrusion. Little furry creatures with long tails sniffed at casualties and scampered up neighboring trees for no apparent reason. Colorful birds peered from screening foliage or flitted across the scene— lines of blurred pigmentation that became camouflage when they ducked abruptly under leaves. Feathered accents to the scene, trying to restore that non-tranquility human observers mistook for peace in such settings. Teg knew better. In his pre-ghola life, he had grown up surrounded by wilderness: farm life close by but wild animals just beyond cultivation. It was not tranquil out there.\nWith that observation he recognized what had tugged at his awareness. Considering the fact they had stormed a well-manned defensive emplacement occupied by heavily armed defenders, the number of casualties down there was extremely small. He had seen nothing to explain this since entering the Citadel. Were they caught off-balance? Their losses in Space were one thing—his ability to see defender ships produced a devastating advantage. But this complex held prepared positions where defenders could have fallen back and made the assault more costly. Collapse of Honored Matre resistance had been abrupt and now it remained unexplained.\n| was wrong to assume they responded to display of their disasters.\nHe glanced at Odrade. “That Great Honored Matre in there, did she give the command for defense to stop?”\n“That’s my assumption.”\nCautious and a typical Bene Gesserit answer. She, too, was subjecting the scene to careful observation.\nWas her assumption a reasonable explanation for the abruptness with which defenders threw down their arms?\nWhy would they do it? To prevent more bloodshed?\nGiven the callousness Honored Matres usually demonstrated, that was unlikely. The decision had been made for reasons that plagued him.\nA trap?\nNow that he thought about it, there were other strange things about the battle scene. None of the usual calls from wounded, no scurrying about with cries for stretchers and medics. He could see Suks moving among the bodies. That, at least, was familiar, but every figure they examined was left where it had fallen.\nAll dead? No wounded?\nHe experienced gripping fear. Not an unusual fear in battle but he had learned to read it. Something profoundly wrong. Noises, things within his view, the smells took on a new intensity. He felt himself acutely attuned, a predatory animal in the jungle, knowing his terrain but aware of something intrusive that must be identified lest he become hunted instead of hunter. He registered his surroundings at a different level of consciousness, reading himself as well, searching out arousal patterns that had achieved this response. Streggi trembled beneath him. So she felt his distress.\n“Something’s very wrong here,” Odrade said.\nHe pushed a hand at her, demanding silence. Even in this tower surrounded by victorious troops, he felt exposed to a threat his clamoring senses failed to reveal.\nDanger!\nHe was sure of it. The unknown frustrated him. It required every bit of his training to keep from falling into a nervous fugue.\nNudging Streggi to turn, Teg barked an order to an aide standing in the balcony doorway. The aide listened quietly and ran to obey. They must get casualty figures. How many wounded compared to deaths? Reports on captured weapons. Urgent!\nWhen he returned to his examination of the scene, he saw another disturbing thing, a basic oddity his eyes had tried to report. Very little blood on those fallen figures in Bene Gesserit uniforms. You expected battle casualties to show that ultimate evidence of common humanity—flowing red that darkened on exposure but always left its indelible mark in the memories of those who Saw it. Lack of bloody Carnage was an unknown and, in warfare, unknown had a history of bringing extreme peril.\nHe spoke softly to Odrade. “They have a weapon we have not discovered.”\nDo not be quick to reveal judgment. Hidden judgment often is more potent. It can guide reactions whose effects are felt only when too late to divert them.\n—BENE GESSERIT ADVICE TO POSTULANTS\nheeana smelled worms at a distance: cinnamon\nundertones of melange mingled with bitter flint and brimstone, the crystal-banked inferno of the great Rakian sand-eaters. But she sensed these tiny descendents only because they existed out there in such numbers.\nThey are so small.\nIt had been hot here at Desert Watch today and now in late afternoon she welcomed the artifically cooled interior. There was a tolerable temperature adjustment in her old quarters although the window on the west had been left open. Sheeana went to that window and stared out at glaring sand.\nMemory told her what this vantage would be tonight: starlight bright in dry air, thin illumination on sand waves that reached to a darkly curved horizon. She remembered Rakian moons and missed them. Stars alone did not satisfy her Fremen heritage.\nShe had thought of this as retreat, a place and time to think about what was happening to her Sisterhood.\nAxlotl tanks, Cyborgs, and now this.\nOdrade’s plan held no mysteries since their Sharing. A gamble? And if it succeeded?\nWe will know perhaps tomorrow and then what will we become?\nShe admitted to a magnet in Desert Watch, more than a place to consider consequences. She had walked in sun- scorched heat today, proving to herself she could still call worms with her dance, emotion expressed as action.\nDance of Propitiation. My language of the worms.\nShe had gone dervish-whirling on a dune until hunger shattered her memory-trance. And little worms were spread all around in gaping watchfulness, remembered flames within the frames of crystal teeth.\nBut why so small?\nThe words of investigators explained but did not satisfy. “It is the dampness.”\nSheeana recalled giant Shai-hulud of Dune, “the Old Man of the Desert,” large enough to swallow spice factories, ring surfaces hard as plastrete. Masters in their own domain. God and devil in the sands. She sensed the potential from her window vantage.\nWhy did the Tyrant choose symbiotic existence in a worm?\nDid those tiny worms carry his endless dream?\nSandtrout inhabitated this desert. Accept them as a new Skin and she might follow the Tyrant’s path.\nMetamorphosis. The Divided God.\nShe knew the lure.\nDo | dare?\nMemories of her last moments of ignorance came over her—barely eight then, the month of Igat on Dune.\nNot Rakis. Dune, as my ancestors named it.\nNot difficult to recall herself as she had been: a slender, dark-skinned child, streaked brown hair. Melange hunter (because that was a task for children) running into open desert with childhood companions. How dear it felt in memory.\nBut memory had its darker side. Focusing attention into the nostrils, a girl detected intense odors—a pre-spice mass!\nThe Blow!\nMelange explosion brought Shaitan. No sandworm could resist a spice blow in its territory.\nYou ate it all, Tyrant, that miserable collection of shacks and hovels we called “home” and all of my friends and family. Why did you spare me?\nWhat a rage had shaken that slender child. Everything she loved taken by a giant worm that refused her attempts to sacrifice herself in its flames and carried her into the hands of Rakian priests, thence to the Bene Gesserit.\n“She talks to the worms and they spare her.”\n“They who spared me are not spared by me.” That was what she had told Odrade.\nAnd now Odrade knows what I must do. You cannot suppress the wild thing, Dar. | dare call you Dar now that you are within me.\nNo response.\nWas there a pearl of Leto II’Ss awareness in each of the new sandworms? Her Fremen ancestors insisted on it.\nSomeone handed her a sandwich. Walli, the senior acolyte assistant who had assumed command of Desert Watch.\nAt my insistence when Odrade elevated me to the Council. But not just because Walli learned my immunity to Honored Matre sexual bonding. And", " Why did you spare me?\nWhat a rage had shaken that slender child.

But not just because Walli learned my immunity to Honored Matre sexual bonding. And not because she Is sensitive to my needs. We speak a secret language, Walli and l.\nWalli’s large eyes no longer were entrances to her soul. They were filmed barriers giving evidence she already knew how to block probing stares; a light blue pigmentation that soon would be all blue if she survived the Agony. Almost albino and a questionable genetic line for breeding. Walli’s Skin reinforced this judgment: pale and freckled. A skin you Saw as a Surface transparency. You did not focus on the skin itself but on what lay beneath: pink, blood-suffused flesh unprotected from a desert sun. Only here in the shade could Walli expose that sensitive surface to questioning eyes.\nWhy this one in command over us?\nBecause I trust her best to do what must be done. Sheeana ate the sandwich absently while she returned her attention to the sandscape. The whole planet thus one day. Another Dune? No... similar but different. How many such places are we creating in an infinite universe?\nSenseless question.\nDesert vagary placed a small black dot in the distance. Sheeana squinted. Ornithopter. It grew slowly larger and then smaller. Quartering the sand. Inspecting.\nWhat are we really creating here?\nWhen she looked at encroaching dunes, she sensed hubris.\nLook upon my works, tiny human, and despair.\nBut we did this, my Sisters and I.\nDid you?\n“| can feel a new dryness in the heat,” Walli said.\nSheeana agreed. No need to speak. She went to the large worktable while she still had daylight to study the topomap spread out there: little flags sticking in it, green thread on pushpins just as she had designed it.\nOdrade had asked once: “Is this really preferable to a projection?”\n“I need to touch it.”\nOdrade accepted that.\nProjections palled. Too far removed from dirt. You could not draw a finger down a projection and say, “We will go down here.” A finger in a projection was a finger in empty air.\nEyes are never enough. The body must feel its world.\nSheeana detected pungency of male perspiration, a musty smell of exertion. She lifted her head and saw a dark young man standing in the doorway, arrogant pose, arrogant look.\n“Oh,” he said. “I thought you would be alone, Walli. l'Il come back later.”\nOne piercing stare at Sheeana and he was gone.\nThere are many things the body must feel to know them.\n“Sheeana, why are you here?” Walli asked.\nYou who are so busy on the Council, what do you seek? Don’t you trust me?\n“I came to consider what the Missionaria still thinks | may do. They see a weapon—the myths of Dune. Billions pray to me: ‘The Holy One who spoke to the Divided God.’”\n“Billions is not an adequate number,” Walli said.\n“But it measures the force my Sisters see in me. Those worshipers believe | died with Dune. I’ve become ‘a powerful spirit in the pantheon of the oppressed.’”\n“More than a missionary?”\n“What might happen, Walli, if | appeared in that waiting universe, a Sandworm beside me? The potential of such a thing fills some of my Sisters with hope and misgivings.”\n“Misgivings | understand.”\nIndeed. The very kind of religious implant Muad’Dib and his Tyrant son set loose on unsuspecting humankind.\n“Why do they even consider it?” Walli insisted.\n“With me as fulcrum, what a lever they would have to move the universe!”\n“But how could they control such a force?”\n“That is the problem. Something so inherently unstable. Religions are never really controllable. But some Sisters think they could aim a religion built around me.”\n“And if their aim is poor?”\n“They say the religions of women always flow deeper.”\n“True?” Questioning a superior source.\nSheeana could only nod. Other Memory confirmed it.\n“Why?”\n“Because within us, life renews itself.”\n“That’s all of it?” Openly doubting.\n“Women often bear the aura of underdog. Humans reserve a special sympathy for ones at the bottom. | am a\nwoman and if Honored Matres want me dead then | must be blessed.”\n“You sound as though you agree with the Missionaria.”\n“When you're one of the hunted, you consider any path of escape. | am revered. | cannot ignore the potential.”\nNor the danger. So my name has become a shining light in the darkness of Honored Matre oppression. How easy for that light to become a consuming flame!\nNo ...the plan she and Duncan had worked out was better. Escape from Chapterhouse. It was a death trap not only for its inhabitants but for Bene Gesserit dreams.\n“I still don’t understand why you’re here. We may no longer be hunted.”\n“May?”\n“But why just now?”\n| cannot speak it openly because then the watchdogs would know.\n“I have this fascination with worms. It’s partly because one of my ancestors led the original migration to Dune.”\nYou remember this, Walli. We spoke of it once out there on the sand with only the two of us to hear. And now you know why | have come visiting.\n“| remember you saying she was a proper Fremen.”\n“And a Zensunni Master.”\nI| will lead my own migration, Walli. But | will need worms only you can provide. And it must be done quickly. The reports from Junction urge speed. And the first ships will return soon. Tonight... tomorrow. | fear what they bring.\n“Are you still interested in taking a few worms back to Central where you can study them closely?”\nOh, yes, Walli! You do remember.\n“It might be interesting. | don’t have much time for such things but any knowledge we gain may help us.”\n“It will be too wet for them back there.”\n“The great Hold of the no-ship on the Flat could be reconverted into a desert lab. Sand, controlled atmosphere.\nThe essentials are there from when we brought the first worm.”\nSheeana glanced at the western window. “Sunset. | would like to go down again and walk on the sand.”\nWill the first ships return tonight?\n“Of course, Reverend Mother.” Walli stood aside, opening the way to the door.\nSheeana spoke as she was leaving. “Desert Watch will have to be moved before long.”\n“We are prepared.”\nThe sun was dipping below the horizon when Sheeana emerged from the arched street at the edge of the community. She strode into starlit desert, exploring with her senses as she had done as a child. Ahhh, there was the cinnamon essence. Worms near.\nShe paused and, turning northeast away from the last sunglow, placed her palms flat above and below her eyes in the old Fremen way, confining view and light. She stared out of a horizontal frame. Whatever fell from heaven must pass this narrow slit.\nTonight? They will come just after dark to delay the moment of explanation. A full night for reflection.\nShe waited with Bene Gesserit patience.\nAn arc of fire drew a thin line above the northern horizon. Another. Another. They were positioned right for the Landing Flat.\nSheeana felt her heart beating fast.\nThey have come!\nAnd what would be their message for the Sisterhood? Returning warriors triumphant or refugees? There could be little difference, given the evolution of Odrade’s plan.\nShe would know by morning.\nSheeana lowered her hands and found she was trembling. Deep breath. The Litany.\nPresently, she walked the desert, sandwalking in the remembered stride of Dune. She had almost forgotten how\nthe feet dragged. As though they carried extra weight. Seldom-used muscles were called into play but the random walk, once learned, was never forgotten.\nOnce, | never dreamed | would ever again walk this way.\nIf watchdogs detected that thought they might wonder about their Sheeana.\nIt was a failure in herself, she thought. She had grown into the rhythms of Chapterhouse. This planet talked to her at a subterranean level. She felt earth, trees, and flowers, every growing thing as though all were part of her. And now, here was disturbing movement, something in a language from a different planet. She sensed the desert changing and that, too, was an alien tongue. Desert. Not lifeless but living in a way profoundly different from once-verdant Chapterhouse.\nLess life but more intense.\nShe heard the desert: small slitherings, creaking chirps of insects, a dark rustle of hunting wings overhead and the quickest of ploppings on the sand—kangaroo mice brought here in anticipation of this day when worms would once more begin their rule.\nWalli will remember to send flora and fauna from Dune.\nShe stopped atop a tall barracan. In front of her, darkness blurring its edges, was an ocean caught in stop motion, a shadow surf beating on a shadow beach of this changing land. It was a limitless desert-sea. It had originated far away and it would go to stranger places than this.\nI| will take you there if |! am able.\nA night breeze from drylands to moister places behind her deposited a film of dust on her cheeks and nose, lifting the edges of her hair as it passed. She felt saddened.\nWhat might have been.\nThat no longer was important.\nThe things that are—they matter.\nShe took a deep breath. Cinnamon stronger. Melange. Spice and worms near. Worms aware of her presence. How\nsoon would this air be dry enough for the sandworms to grow great and work their crop as they had on Dune?\nThe planet and the desert.\nShe saw them as two halves of the same saga. Just as the Bene Gesserit and the humankind they served. Matched halves. Either without the other was diminished, an emptiness with lost purpose. Not better dead, perhaps, but moving aimlessly. There lay the threat of Honored Matre victory. Aimed by blind violence!\nBlind in a hostile universe.\nAnd there was why the Tyrant had preserved the Sisterhood.\nHe knew he only gave us the path without direction. A paper chase laid down by a jokester and left empty at the end.\nA poet in his own right, though.\nShe recalled his “Memory Poem” from Dar-es-Balat, a bit of jetsam the Bene Gesserit preserved.\nAnd for what reason do we preserve it? So I can fill my mind with it now? Forgetting for the moment what I may confront tomorrow?\nThe fair night of the poet,\nFill it with innocent stars.\nA pace apart Orion stands. His glare sees everything, Marking our genes forever.
