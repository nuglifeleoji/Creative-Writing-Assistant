Humans must be wary of them, too.\n“Careful,” Leto said, moving down the slippery ledge. He fastened his memory to times and places his flesh had never known. Ghanima followed.\nAt the end of the qanat they stripped to their stillsuits and put on the new robes. They left the old Fremen robes behind as they climbed out another inspection tube, wormed their way over a dune and down the far side. There they sat shielded from the sietch, strapped on maula pistols and crysknives, slipped the Fremkit packs onto their shoulders. They no longer could hear the music.\nLeto arose, struck out through the valley between the dunes.\nGhanima fell into step behind him, moving with practiced unrhythmical quiet over the open sand.\nBelow the crest of each dune they bent low and crept across into the hidden lee, there to pause and peer backward seeking pursuit. No hunters had emerged upon the desert by the time they reached the first rocks.\nIn the shadows of the rocks they worked their way around The Attendant, climbed to a ledge looking out upon the desert. Colors blinked far out on the bled. The darkening air held the fragility of fine crystal. The landscape which met their gaze was beyond pity, nowhere did it pause—no\nhesitations in it at all. The gaze stayed upon no single place in its scanning movements across that immensity.\nIt is the horizon of eternity, Leto thought.\nGhanima crouched beside her brother, thinking: The attack will come soon. She listened for the slightest sound, her whole body transformed into a single sense of taut probing.\nLeto sat equally alert. He knew now the culmination of all the training which had gone into the lives he shared so intimately. In this wilderness one developed a firm dependence upon the senses, a// of the senses. Life became a hoard of stored perceptions, each one linked only to momentary survival.\nPresently Ghanima climbed up the rocks and peered through a notch at the way they had come. The safety of the sietch seemed a lifetime away, a bulk of dumb cliffs rising out of the brown-purple distance, dust-blurred edges at the rim where the last of the sunlight cast its silver streaks. Still no pursuit could be seen in the intervening distance. She returned to Leto’s side.\n“It'll be a predatory animal,” Leto said. “That’s my tertiary computation.”\n“I think you stopped computing too soon,” Ghanima said. “It'll be more than one animal. House Corrino has learned not to put all of its hopes into a single bag.”\nLeto nodded agreement.\nHis mind felt suddenly heavy with the multitude of lives which his difference provided him: all of those lives, his even before birth. He was saturated with living and wanted to flee from his own consciousness. The inner world was a heavy beast which could devour him.\nRestlessly he arose, climbed to the notch Ghanima had used, peered at the cliffs of the sietch. Back there, beneath the cliff, he could see how the qanat drew a line between life and death. On the oasis edge he could see camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa. In the last of the\nlight he could make out the black movements of birds pick- hopping in the alfalfa. The distant grain tassels were ruffled by a wind which drew shadows that moved right up to the orchard. The motion caught at his awareness, and he saw that the shadows hid within their fluid form a larger change, and that larger change gave ransom to the turning rainbows of a silver-dusted sky.\nWhat will happen out here? he asked himself.\nAnd he knew it would either be death or the play of death, himself the object. Ghanima would be the one to return, believing the reality of a death she had seen or reporting sincerely from a deep hypnotic compulsion that her brother was, indeed, slain.\nThe unknowns of this place haunted him. He thought how easy it would be to succumb to the demand for prescience, to risk launching his awareness into an unchanging, absolute future. The small vision of his dream was bad enough, though. He knew he dared not risk the larger vision.\nPresently, he returned to Ghanima’s side.\n“No pursuit yet,” he said.\n“The beasts they send for us will be large,” Ghanima said. “We may have time to see them coming.”\n“Not if they come in the night.”\n“It'll be dark very soon,” she said.\n“Yes. It’s time we went down into our place.” He indicated the rocks to their left and below them where windsand had eaten a tiny cleft in the basalt. It was large enough to admit them, but small enough to keep out large creatures. Leto felt himself reluctant to go there, but knew it must be done. That was the place he’d pointed out to Stilgar.\n“They may really kill us,” he said.\n“This is the chance we have to take,” she said. “We owe it to our father.”\n“l'm not arguing.”\nAnd he thought: This is the correct path; we do the right thing. But he knew how dangerous it was to be right in this\nuniverse. Their survival now demanded vigor and fitness and an understanding of the limitations in every moment. Fremen ways were their best armor, and the Bene Gesserit knowledge was a force held in reserve. They were both thinking now as Atreides-trained battle veterans with no other defenses than a Fremen toughness which was not even hinted at by their childish bodies and their formal attire.\nLeto fingered the hilt of the poison-tipped crysknife at his waist. Unconsciously Ghanima duplicated the gesture.\n“Shall we go down now?” Ghanima asked. As she spoke she saw the movement far below them, small movement made less threatening by distance. Her stillness alerted Leto before she could utter a warning.\n“Tigers,” he said.\n“Laza tigers,” she corrected him.\n“They see us,” he said.\n“We'd better hurry,” she said. “A maula would never stop those creatures. They will’ve been well trained for this.”\n“They'll have a human director somewhere around,” he said, leading the way at a fast lope down the rocks to the left.\nGhanima agreed, but kept it to herself, saving her strength. There’d be a human around somewhere. Those tigers couldn’t be allowed to run free until the proper moment.\nThe tigers moved fast in the last of the light, leaping from rock to rock. They were eye-minded creatures and soon it would be night, the time of the ear-minded. The bell-call of a nightbird came from The Attendant’s rocks to emphasize the change. Creatures of the darkness already were hustling in the shadows of the etched crevasses.\nStill the tigers remained visible to the running twins. The animals flowed with power, a rippling sense of golden sureness in every movement.\nLeto felt that he had stumbled into this place to free himself from his soul. He ran with the sure knowledge that he and Ghanima could reach their narrow notch in time, but his gaze kept returning with fascination to the oncoming beasts.\nOne stumble and we're lost, he thought.\nThat thought reduced the sureness of his knowledge, and he ran faster.\nYou Bene Gesserit call your activity of the Panoplia Prophetica a “Science of Religion.” Very well. |, a seeker after another kind of scientist, find this an appropriate definition.

Around her were the bare rocks of an old and poor sietch, one of the original settlements. It lay below the rim of Red Chasm, sheltered from the westerlies of the desert. Al-Fali and his brothers had brought her here; now they awaited word from Stilgar. The Fedaykin had moved cautiously in the matter of communication, however. Stilgar was not to know their location.\nThe Fedaykin already knew they were under a procès- verbal, an official report of crimes against the Imperium. Alia was taking the tack that her mother had been suborned by enemies of the realm, although the Sisterhood had not yet been named. The high-handed, tyrannical nature of Alia’s power was out in the open, however, and her belief that because she controlled the Priesthood she controlled the Fremen was about to be tested.\nJessica’s message to Stilgar had been direct and simple: “My daughter is possessed and must be put to the trial.”\nFears destroyed values, though, and it already was known that some Fremen would prefer not to believe this accusation. Their attempts to use the accusation as a\npassport had brought on two battles during the night, but the ornithopters al-Fali’s people had stolen had brought the fugitives to this precarious safety: Red Chasm Sietch. Word was going out to the Fedaykin from here, but fewer than two hundred of them remained on Arrakis. The others held posts throughout the Empire.\nReflecting upon these facts, Jessica wondered if she had come to the place of her death. Some of the Fedaykin believed it, but the death commandos accepted this easily enough. Al-Fali had merely grinned at her when some of his young men voiced their fears.\n“When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature’s wants to direct him to that place,” the old Naib had said.\nThe patched curtains at her doorway rustled; al-Fali entered. The old man’s narrow, windburned face appeared drawn, his eyes feverish. Obviously he had not rested.\n“Someone comes,” he said.\n“From Stilgar?”\n“Perhaps.” He lowered his eyes, glanced leftward in the manner of the old Fremen who brought bad news.\n“What is it?” Jessica demanded.\n“We have word from Tabr that your grandchildren are not there.” He spoke without looking at her.\n“Alia...”\n“She has ordered that the twins be given over to her custody, but Sietch Tabr reports that the children are not there. That is all we know.”\n“Stilgar’s sent them into the desert,” Jessica said.\n“Possibly, but it is known that he was searching for them all through the night. Perhaps it was a trick on his part... .”\n“That’s not Stilgar’s way,” she said, and thought: Unless the twins put him up to it. But that didn’t feel right either. She wondered at herself: no sensations of panic to suppress, and her fears for the twins were tempered by what Ghanima had revealed. She peered up at al-Fali, found him studying\nher with pity in his eyes. She said: “They’ve gone into the desert by themselves.”\n“Alone? Those two children!”\nShe did not bother to explain that “those two children” probably knew more about desert survival than most living Fremen. Her thoughts were fixed, instead, on Leto’s odd behavior when he’d insisted that she allow herself to be abducted. She’d put the memory aside, but this moment demanded it. He’d said she would know the moment to obey him.\n“The messenger should be in the sietch by now,” al-Fali said. “I will bring him to you.” He let\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_268a4dd13770d2ca3599433a3b25c772400b3d8fd1e39cf3a761c67af51aee9f_v2"}
