Moneo feared a universe where there was no God Emperor. He would rather die than see such a universe.\n“What will happen today?” Moneo demanded.\nIt was a question directed not to the God Emperior but to the prophet.\n“A seed blown on the wind could be tomorrow’s willow tree,” Leto said.\n“You know our future! Why won’t you share it?” Moneo was close to hysteria. . . refusing anything his immediate senses did not report.\nLeto turned to glare at the majordomo, a gaze so obviously filled with pent-up emotions that Moneo recoiled from it.\n“Take charge of your own existence, Moneo!”\nMoneo took a deep, trembling breath. “Lord, | meant no offense. | sought only...”\n“Look upward, Moneo!”\nInvoluntarily, Moneo obeyed, peering into the cloudless sky where morning light was increasing. “What is it, Lord?”\n“There’s no reassuring ceiling over you, Moneo. Only an open sky full of changes. Welcome it. Every sense you\npossess is an instrument for reacting to change. Does that tell you nothing?”\n“Lord, | only came out to inquire when you would be ready to proceed.”\n“Moneo, | beg you to be truthful with me.”\n“lam truthful, Lord!”\n“But if you live in bad faith, lies will appear to you like the truth.”\n“Lord, if I lie... then I| do not know it.”\n“That has the ring of truth. But | know what you dread and will not speak.”\nMoneo began to tremble. The God Emperor was in the most terrible of moods, a deep threat in every word.\n“You dread the imperialism of consciousness,” Leto said, “and you are right to fear it. Send Hwi out here immediately!”\nMoneo whirled and fled back into the guest house. It was as though his entrance stirred up an insect colony. Within seconds, Fish Speakers emerged and spread around the Royal Cart. Courtiers peered from the guest house windows or came out and stood under deep eaves, afraid to approach him. In contrast to this excitement, Hwi emerged presently from the wide central doorway and strode out of the shadows, moving slowly toward Leto, her chin up, her gaze seeking his face.\nLeto felt himself becoming calm as he looked at her. She wore a golden gown he had not seen before. It had been piped with silver and jade at the neck and the cuffs of its long sleeves. The hem, almost dragging on the ground, had heavy green braid to outline deep red crenelations.\nHwi smiled as she stopped in front of him.\n“Good morning, Love.” She spoke softly. “What have you done to get poor Moneo so upset?”\nSoothed by her presence and her voice, he smiled. “I did what | always hope to do. | produced an effect.”\n“You certainly did. He told the Fish Speakers you were in an angry and terrifying mood. Are you terrifying, Love?”\n“Only to those who refuse to live by their own strengths.”\n“Ahhh, yes.” She pirouetted for him then, displaying her new gown. “Do you like it? Your Fish Speakers gave it to me. They decorated it themselves.”\n“My love,” he said, a warning note in his voice, “decoration! That is how you prepare the sacrifice.”\nShe came up to the edge of the cart and leaned on it just below his face, a mock solemn expression on her lips. “Will they sacrifice me, then?”\n“Some of them would like to.”\n“But you will not permit it.”\n“Our fates are joined,” he said.\n“Then I shall not fear.” She reached up and touched one of his silver-skinned hands, but jerked away as his fingers began to tremble.\n“Forgive me, Love. | forget that we are joined in soul and not in flesh,” she said.\nThe sandtrout skin still shuddered from Hwi’s touch. “Moisture in the air makes me overly sensitive,” he said. Slowly, the shuddering subsided.\n“| refuse to regret what cannot be,” she whispered.\n“Be strong, Hwi, for your soul is mine.”\nShe turned at a sound from the guest house. “Moneo returns,” she said. “Please, Love, do not frighten him.”\n“Is Moneo your friend, too?”\n“We are friends of the stomach. We both like yogurt.”\nLeto was still chuckling when Moneo stopped beside Hwi. Moneo ventured a smile, casting a puzzled glance at Hwi. There was gratitude in the majordomo’s manner and some of the subservience he was accustomed to show to Leto he now directed at Hwi. “Is it well with you, Lady Hwi?”\n“It is well with me.”\nLeto said: “In the time of the stomach, friendships of the stomach are to be nurtured and cultivated. Let us be on our\nway, Moneo. Tuono awaits.”\nMoneo turned and shouted orders to the Fish Speakers and courtiers.\nLeto grinned at Hwi. “Do | not play the impatient bridegroom with a certain style?”\nShe leaped lightly up to the bed of his cart, her skirt gathered in one hand. He unfolded her seat. Only when she was Seated, her eyes level with Leto’s, did she respond, and then it was in a voice pitched for his ears alone.\n“Love of my soul, | have captured another of your secrets.”\n“Release it from your lips,” he said, joking in this new intimacy between them.\n“You seldom need words,” she said. “You speak directly to the senses with your own life.”\nA shudder flexed its way through the length of his body. It was a moment before he could speak and then it was ina voice she had to strain to hear above the hubbub of the assembling cortege.\n“Between the superhuman and the inhuman,” he said, “l have had little space in which to be human. I thank you, gentle and lovely Hwi, for this little space.”\nIn all of my universe | have seen no /aw of nature, unchanging and inexorable. This universe presents only changing relationships which are sometimes seen as laws by short-lived awareness. These fleshly sensoria which we call se/fare ephemera withering in the blaze of infinity, fleetingly aware of temporary conditions which confine our activities and change as our activities change. If you must label the absolute, use its proper name: Temporary.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nN ayla was the first to glimpse the approaching cortege. Perspiring heavily in the midday heat, she stood near one of the rock pillars which marked the edges of the Royal Road. A sudden flash of distant reflection caught her attention. She peered in that direction, squinting, realizing with a thrill of awareness that she saw sun-dazzle on the cover of the God Emperor’s cart.\n“They come!” she called.\nShe felt hunger then. In their excitement and singleness of purpose, none of them had brought food. Only the Fremen had brought water and that because “Fremen always carry water when they leave sietch.” They did it by rote.\nNayla touched one finger to the butt of the lasgun holstered at her hip. The bridge lay no more than twenty meters ahead of her, its faery structure arching across the chasm like an alien fantasy joining one barren surface to another.\nThis is madness, she thought.\nBut the God Emperor had reinforced his command. He required his Nayla to obey Siona in all things.\nSiona’s orders were explicit, leaving no way for evasions. And Nayla had no way here to query her God Emperor. Siona\nhad said: “When his cart is in the middle of the bridge— then!”\n“But why?”\nThey had been standing well away from the others in the chill dawn atop the barrier Wall, Nayla feeling precariously isolated here, remote and vulnerable.\nSiona’s grim features, her low, intense voice, could not be denied. “Do you think you can harm God?”\n“I...” Nayla could only shrug.\n“You must obey me!”\n“I must,” Nayla agreed.\nNayla studied the approach of the distant cortege, noting the colors of the courtiers, the thick masses of blue marking her sisters of the Fish Speakers... the shiny surface of her Lord’s cart.\nIt was another test, she decided. The God Emperor would know. He would know the devotion in His Nayla’s heart. It was a test. The God Emperor’s commands must be obeyed in all things. That was the earliest lesson of her Fish Speaker childhood. The God Emperor had said that Nayla must obey Siona. It was a test. What else could it be?\nShe looked toward the four Fremen. They had been positioned by Duncan Idaho directly in the roadway and blocking part of the exit from this end of the bridge. They sat with their backs to her and looked out across the bridge, four brown-robed mounds. Nayla had heard Idaho’s words to them.\n“Do not leave this place. You must greet him from here. Stand when he nears you and bow low.”\nGreet, yes.\nNayla nodded to herself.\nThe three other Fish Speakers who had climbed the Barrier Wall with her had been sent to the center of the bridge. All they knew was what Siona had told them in Nayla’s presence. They were to wait until the Royal Cart was only a few paces from them, then they were to turn and\ndance away from the cart, leading it and the procession toward the vantage point above Tuono.\nIf | cut the bridge with my lasgun, those three will die, Nayla thought. And all the others who come with our Lord.\nNayla craned her neck to peer down into the gorge. She could not see the river from here, but she could hear its distant rumblings, a movement of rocks.\nThey would all die!\nUnless He performs a Miracle.\nThat had to be it. Siona had set the stage for a Holy Miracle. What else could Siona intend now that she had been tested, now that she wore the uniform of Fish Speaker Command? Siona had given her oath to the God Emperor. She had been tested by God, the two of them alone in the Sareer.\nNayla turned only her eyes to the right, peering at the architects of this greeting. Siona and Idaho stood shoulder- to-shoulder in the roadway about twenty meters to Nayla’s right. They were deep in conversation, looking at each other occasionally, nodding.\nPresently, Idaho touched Siona’s arm—an oddly possessive gesture. He nodded once and strode off toward the bridge, stopping at the buttress corner directly in front of Nayla. He peered down, then crossed to the other near corner of the bridge. Again, he peered downward, standing there for several minutes before returning to Siona.\nWhat a strange creature, that ghola, Nayla thought. After that awesome climb, she no longer thought of him as quite human. He was something else, a demiurge who stood next to God. But he could breed.\nA distant shout caught Nayla’s attention.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is the majordomo of the God Emperor, fearful of a universe without his rule and often anxious about his duties\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The God Emperor is a powerful and prophetic ruler, feared and revered, who speaks directly to the senses and emotions of those around him\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI<|>PERSON<|>Hwi is a close companion of the God Emperor, wearing a golden gown and sharing a deep, soulful connection with him\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are a group of loyal guards and courtiers who serve the God Emperor, often seen in blue uniforms\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROYAL CART<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Royal Cart is the vehicle of the God Emperor, a symbol of his power and presence\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUONO<|>GEO<|>Tuono is a destination mentioned by the God Emperor, possibly a place of significance\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAYLA<|>PERSON<|>Nayla is a Fish Speaker who is conflicted about her duties and the commands given to her by Siona\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a Fish Speaker Command who gives orders to Nayla and is involved in a plot involving the God Emperor\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola, a demiurge who stands next to God, involved in the events surrounding the God Emperor\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a group of desert-dwellers who carry water by rote and are positioned near the bridge\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROYAL ROAD<|>GEO<|>The Royal Road is a path marked by rock pillars, leading to the bridge where the God Emperor's cortege approaches\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIDGE<|>GEO<|>The bridge is a faery structure arching across a chasm, a critical location in the plot\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Moneo serves as the majordomo to the God Emperor and fears a universe without him<|>8)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Hwi shares a deep, soulful connection with the God Emperor, calming him with her presence<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>The Fish Speakers are loyal guards and courtiers who serve the God Emperor<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAYLA<|>SIONA<|>Nayla is conflicted about obeying Siona's orders, which involve a plot against the God Emperor<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Siona and Duncan Idaho are deep in conversation, planning something involving the God Emperor<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>The Fremen are positioned by Duncan Idaho near the bridge, following his orders<|>6)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAYLA<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Nayla is a Fish Speaker who is devoted to the God Emperor but is conflicted about her duties<|>5)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>TUONO<|>The God Emperor mentions Tuono as a destination, indicating its significance<|>4)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
