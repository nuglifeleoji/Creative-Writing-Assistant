\n　　他突然发现郝红梅在前面走。她大概没有看见他在后面。他真想喊一声她，问问那本书的事。 \n　　他这时看见前面走着的郝红梅，弯下腰把一个什么东西放在了路边的一个土台子上，仍然头也不回地走了，身影即刻就消失在女生宿舍的拐弯处。 \n　　孙少平感到有点惊奇。在走过她刚才弯腰的地方，他眼睛猛地一亮：这不正是他那本《创业史》吗？好，你还记得这件事！唉，你为什么不直接交给我，何必用这种办法……他拿起那本书，却在暮黑中感觉一些什么东西从书页中掉在了地上。 \n　　他一惊，赶忙低头到地上去摸。他抬起了一块软软的东西，凑到眼前一看：天啊，原来是块白面饼！ \n　　他什么也没顾上想，赶忙摸着在地上把散落的饼都拾起来。饼上沾了土，他用嘴分别吹干净。 \n　　他拿着这几块白面饼，站在黑暗的学校院子里，眼里含满了泪水。不，他不只是拾起了几块饼，而是又重新找回了他那已经失去了好些日子的友谊和温暖！ \n　　……就是因为这些原因，孙少平才重新又对这学校充满了热爱。于是，这学期报名日子一到，他就一天也没误赴忙来了学校，甚至都有些迫不及待哩…… \n                  第17章\n　　开学已经两个多星期，孙少平还没有机会和郝红梅单独说话。 \n　　他看见红梅换了一件半旧的红格子布衫，好象变了另外一个人似的。大概由于一个假期在家里，这个季节吃的东西又比较多一些，她原来很瘦削的脸颊现在看起来丰满了许多。已经度过了半年的城市生活，她也懂得把自己农村式的“家娃”头，象城市姑娘一样扎起了两个短辫；加上自做的、手工精细的方口鞋和一条看起来是新买的天蓝色裤子，简直让人都认不出来这就是郝红梅了。其实她无非就是把原来的一身补钉衣服换成了没有补钉的衣服。这个小小的变化，就使一个本来不显眼的人，一下子很引人注目了。同时也应该承认，郝红梅本来就具备那种漂亮姑娘的脸型和身段。如果有一身比现在更漂亮的衣服，就很难看出这姑娘是来自农村了。 \n　　孙少平看见她，心中就会荡起一股热辣辣的激流，有时甚至感到呼吸都有了困难。 \n　　当然，他自己的衣服还是老模样。一身家织的老粗布，尽管金波妈给他裁剪成制服式样，但仍然不能掩饰它本质上的土气；加上暑假给家里砍柴，被活柴活草染得肮肮脏脏，开学前快�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
