\n　　高中毕业以后，郝红梅和所有农村学生一样，回到了村子里。临毕业时因为贫穷和虚荣，她曾在原西城百货二门市干了那件蠢事——几块手帕几乎就断送了她的生活。幸亏孙少平的帮助，否则她当时就无脸见世人，说不定会寻了短见。好在一切都暗中平息了。她终于保全了名誉，象逃跑一样离开了原西县城。 \n　　回到村子以后，她慢慢才把心平静下来。她竭力使自己忘掉那件丑陋事。不久以后，在公社教育专干的帮助下，她在村里教了书。生活似乎再一次被太阳照亮了。 \n　　这期间，她一直和城里的顾养民保持着通信关系。他们的信件来往十分频繁，每个星期都各写一封。在信中，相互间的恋爱已经公开了。她每个星期都在等待那封甜蜜的信，沉浸在无比的幸福之中。她看来似乎真的已经忘记了那件刺伤她心灵的偷窃事件。 \n　　过了不久，她按捺不住自己的激动，就把她和顾养民的关系向父母亲说了。 \n　　当然，两个老人比她还激动。和大名鼎鼎的顾健翎老先生的后人结亲，对一个地主成份的农民家庭来说，那简直是一种荣耀。如果在旧社会，红梅她爸发达的时候，这亲事也可以说门当户对。可如今他们是什么光景！和顾家比较，人家在天上，自家在地下，差别太大了！两个老人快慰的是，他们含辛茹苦供养女儿上学，一番苦心终于没有白操。 \n　　由于这件事的出现，这个多年破败和晦气的家庭一下子有了生气。在亲人们的眼里，红梅成了全家的大救星。 \n　　但是，命运常常捉弄人。一九七八年春天，灾难重新降临在了郝红梅的头上。 \n　　她自己并不知道，“偷手帕事件”败露在了她亲爱的人面前。传播这件丑闻的是跛女子的父亲侯生才。因为顾健翎是全县的知名人士，他孙子的婚事也就会有许多人关心。当养民和红梅的关系在县城有了传闻后，侯生才不久就知道，顾先生的孙媳妇竟然就是在他门市偷过手帕的女学生。小市民拨弄事非的劣根性，使他迫不及待向顾老先生告了密。侯生才一家人身体都不好，常到顾先生那里去看病；在侯生才想来，给顾先生揭穿这个“西洋镜”，往后先生给他们家的人看病就会更认真了，说不定老人家还会拿出什么祖传秘方。把女儿侯玉英的那条跛腿治成好腿哩！ \n　　顾健翎一生修身养性，崇尚《朱子治家格言》，岂能容一个偷鸡摸狗者成为自己的孙媳妇？他将养民叫到跟前\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>郝红梅<|>PERSON<|>郝红梅 is a rural student who
