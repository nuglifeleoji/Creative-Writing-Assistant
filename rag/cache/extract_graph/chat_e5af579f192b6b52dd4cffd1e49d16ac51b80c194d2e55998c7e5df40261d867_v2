The blade trembled in his hand, but his gnome fingers still curled inward around it as though clasping a throat.\n“Treachery, Lady? Oh, no. But it occurred to us that we asked too little for this copy. Poor as it is, making it and selling it this way puts us in dreadful peril.”\nSiona glared at him, thinking of the old Fremen words from the Oral History: “Once you acquire a marketplace soul, the suk is the totality of existence.”\n“How much do you want?” she demanded.\nHe named a sum twice his original figure.\nTopri gasped.\nSiona looked at Topri. “Do you have that much?”\n“Not quite, but we agreed on...”\n“Give him what you have, all of it,” Siona said.\n“All of it?”\n“Isn't that what | said? Every coin in that bag.” She faced the Museum Fremen. “You will accept this payment.” It was not a question and the old man heard her correctly. He wrapped the blade in its cloth and passed it to her.\nTopri handed over the pouch of coins, muttering under his breath.\nSiona addressed herself to the Museum Fremen. “We know your name. You are Teishar, aide to Garun of Tuono. You have a suk mentality and you make me shudder at what Fremen have become.”\n“Lady, we all have to live,” he protested.\n“You are not alive,” she said. “Be gone!”\nTeishar had turned and scurried away, clutching the money pouch close to his chest.\nMemory of that night did not sit well in Siona’s mind as she watched Topri wave the crysknife copy in their rebel ceremony. We're no better than Teishar, she thought. A copy is worse than nothing. Topri brandished the stupid blade over his head as he neared the ceremony’s conclusion.\nSiona looked away from him and stared at Nayla seated off to her left. Nayla was looking first one direction and now another. She paid special attention to the new cadre of recruits at the back of the room. Nayla did not give her trust easily. Siona wrinkled her nose as a stirring of the air brought the smell of lubricants. The depths of Onn always smelled dangerously mechanical! She sniffed. And this room! She did not like their meeting place. It could easily be a trap. Guards could seal off the outer corridors and send in armed searchers. This could be too easily the place where their rebellion ended. Siona was made doubly uneasy by the fact that this room had been Topri’s choice.\nOne of Ulot’s few mistakes, she thought. Poor dead Ulot had approved Topri’s admission to the rebellion.\n“He is a minor functionary in city services,” Ulot had explained. “Topri can find us many useful places to meet and arm ourselves.”\nTopri had reached almost the end of his ceremony. He placed the knife in an ornate case and put the case on the floor beside him.\n“My face is my pledge,” he said. He turned his profile to the room, first one side and then the other. “I show my face that you may know me anywhere and know that | am one of you.”\nStupid ceremony, Siona thought.\nBut she dared not break the pattern of it. And when Topri pulled a black gauze mask from a pocket and placed it over his head, she took out her own mask and donned it. Everyone in the room did the same thing. There was a stirring around the room now. Most of the people here had been alerted that Topri had brought a special visitor. Siona secured her mask’s tie behind her neck. She was anxious to see this visitor.\nTopri moved to the room’s one door. There was a clattering bustle as everyone stood and the chairs were folded and stacked against the wall opposite the door. At a signal from Siona, Topri tapped three times on the door panel, waited for a two-count, then tapped four times.\nThe door opened and a tall man in a dark brown official singlet slipped into the room. He wore no mask, his face open for all of them to see—thin and imperious with a narrow mouth, a skinny blade of a nose, dark brown eyes deeply set under bushy brows. It was a face recognized by most of the room’s occupants.\n“My friends,” Topri said, “I present Iyo Kobat, Ambassador from Ix.”\n“Ex-Ambassador,” Kobat said. His voice was guttural and tightly controlled. He took a position with his back to the\nwall facing the masked people in the room. “I have this day received orders from our God Emperor to leave Arrakis in disgrace.”\n“Why?”\nSiona snapped the question at him without formality.\nKobat jerked his head around, a quick movement which fixed his gaze on her masked face. “There has been an attempt on the God Emperor's life. He traced the weapon to me.”\nSiona’s companions opened a space between her and the ex-Ambassador, clearly signaling that they deferred to her.\n“Then why didn’t he kill you?” she demanded.\n“I think he is telling me that | am not worth killing. There is also the fact that he uses me now to carry a message to Ix.”\n“What message?” Siona moved through the cleared space to stop within two paces of Kobat. She recognized the sexual alertness in him as he studied her body.\n“You are Moneo’s daughter,” he said.\nSoundless tension exploded across the room. Why did he reveal that he recognized her? Who else did he recognize here? Kobat did not appear the fool. Why had he done this?\n“Your body, your voice and your manner are well known here in Onn,” he said. “That mask is a foolishness.”\nShe ripped the mask from her head and smiled at him. “I agree. Now answer my question.”\nShe heard Nayla move up close on her left; two more aides chosen by Nayla came up beside her.\nSiona saw the moment of realization come over Kobat— his death if he failed to satisfy her demands. His voice did not lose its tight control but he spoke slower, choosing his words more carefully.\n“The God Emperor has told me that he knows about an agreement between Ix and the Guild. We are attempting to make a mechanical amplifier of . . . those Guild navigational talents which presently rely on melange.”\n“In this room we call him the Worm,” Siona said. “What would your Ixian machine do?”\n“You are aware that Guild Navigators require the spice before they can see the safe path to traverse?”\n“You would replace the navigators with a machine?”\n“It may be possible.”\n“What message do you carry to your people concerning this machine?”\n“I am to tell my people that they may continue the project only if they send him daily reports on their progress.”\nShe shook her head. “He needs no such reports! That’s a stupid message.”\nKobat swallowed, no longer concealing nervousness.\n“The Guild and the Sisterhood are excited by our project,” he said. “They are participating.”\nSiona nodded once. “And they pay for their participation by sharing spice with Ix.”\nKobat glared at her. “It’s expensive work and we need the spice for comparative testing by Guild Navigators.”\n“It is a lie and a cheat,” she said. “Your device will never work and the Worm knows it.”\n“How dare you accuse us of...”\n“Be still! | have just told you the real message. The Worm is telling you Ixians to continue cheating the Guild and the Bene Gesserit. It amuses him.”\n“It could work!” Kobat insisted.\nShe merely smiled at him. “Who tried to kill the Worm?”\n“Duncan Idaho.”\nNayla gasped. There were other small signs of surprise around the room, a frown, an indrawn breath.\n“Is Idaho dead?” Siona asked.\n“| presume so, but the... ahhh, Worm refuses to confirm it.”\n“Why do you presume him dead?”\n“The Tleilaxu have sent another Idaho ghola.”\n“| see.”\nSiona turned and signaled to Nayla, who went to the side of the room and returned with a slim package wrapped in pink Suk paper, the kind of paper shopkeepers used to enclose small purchases. Nayla handed the package to Siona.\n“This is the price of our silence,” Siona said, extending the package to Kobat. “This is why Topri was permitted to bring you here tonight.”\nKobat took the package without removing his attention from her face.\n“Silence?” he asked.\n“We undertake not to inform the Guild and Sisterhood that you are cheating them.”\n“We are not cheat...”\n“Don’t be a fool!”\nKobat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her meaning had become plain to him: true or not, if the rebellion spread\nsuch a story it would be believed. It was “common sense” as\nTopri was fond of saying. Siona glanced at Topri who stood just behind Kobat. No\none joined this rebellion for reasons of “common sense.” Did\nTopri not realize that his “common sense” might betray him? She returned her attention to Kobat.\n“What’s in this package?” he asked.\nSomething in the way he asked it told Siona he already knew.\n“That is something | am sending to Ix. You will take it there for me. That is copies of two volumes we removed from the Worm’s fortress.”\nKobat stared down at the package in his hands. It was obvious that he wanted to drop the thing, that his venture into rebellion had loaded him with a burden more deadly than he had expected. He shot a scowling glance at Topri which said as though he had spoken it: “Why didn’t you warn me?”\n“What...” He brought his gaze back to Siona, cleared his throat. “What’s in these... . volumes?”\n“Your people may tell us that. We think they are the Worm’s own words, written in a cipher which we cannot read.”\n“What makes you think we...”\n“You Ixians are clever at such things.”\n“And if we fail?”\nShe shrugged. “We will not blame you for that. However, should you use those volumes for any other purpose or fail to report a success fully...”\n“How can anyone be Sure we...”\n“We will not depend only on you. Others will get copies. | think the Sisterhood and the Guild will not hesitate to try deciphering those volumes.”\nKobat slipped the package under his arm and pressed it against his body.\n“What makes you think the... the Worm doesn’t know about your intentions ... even about this meeting?”\n“I think he knows many such things, that he may even know who took those volumes. My father believes he is truly prescient.”\n“Your father believes the Oral History!”\n“Everyone in this room believes it. The Oral History does not disagree with the Formal History on important matters.”\n“Then why doesn’t the Worm act against you?”\nShe pointed to the package under Kobat’s arm. “Perhaps the answer is in there.”\n“Or you and these cryptic volumes are no real threat to him!” Kobat was not concealing his anger. He did not like being forced into decisions.\n“Perhaps. Tell me why you mentioned the Oral History.”\nOnce more, Kobat heard the menace.\n“It says the Worm is incapable of human emotions.”\n“That is not the reason,” she said. “You will get one more chance to tell me the reason.”\nNayla moved two steps closer to Kobat.\n“I... Iwas told to review the Oral History before coming here, that your people . . .” He shrugged.\n“That we chant it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Who told\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e5af579f192b6b52dd4cffd1e49d16ac51b80c194d2e55998c7e5df40261d867_v2"}
