\n　　经中央同意，省委决定改组市委。秦富功同志被免去了省委副书记兼市委书记职务，等人大会议召开时，拟增补为省人大常委会副主任……田福军正是在这个背景上接替了秦富功的职务。 \n　　现在，他已经在市委上任了。爱云和岳父要等一段时间才能搬下来，因此他就在办公室里间临时支了一张床。从家庭方面来说，全家将团圆了。儿子晓晨和女儿晓霞已经兴奋地来看了他；见他忙，都坐一坐就回了各自的单位。可就工作来说，却比黄原更沉重了；因为所面临的许多事，都是他原来所不熟悉的。 \n　　田福军上任还没有几天，黑龙河农场事件又旧病复发了。那里的问题因为没有从根本上得到解决，农场职工们不满意，又开始聚集闹事。这次闹事的方式和上次一样，许多人再次坐着汽车来到市委要求解决遗留问题。不过，这次规模没有上次大，老人儿童没有来——孩子们的校舍已经腾出来，下学期上课没什么问题。 \n　　规模虽然小，但影响照样很大。省城又顿时为之哗然。市委大门前的小广场上重新变得象闹市一般乱。 \n　　田福军紧急采取了措施。他先让办公室安排了这些人的吃饭和住宿。不能再把事情摆到大街上解决！通过和电视台与电影制片厂联系，把许多电影和电视录像片拿到了这些人住宿的地方。田福军指示：要武打片！要情节曲折热闹的录像！一部接着一部放！ \n　　这样，闹事的农场职工总算先安顿了下来。 \n　　市委同时召开紧急扩大会议，研究解决问题的办法。田福军先提了两点意见让大家讨论：一是农场退出一部分地给农民；二是农场出租土地给农民。他说这只是他的一些不成熟想法，让常委们和政府部门的同志充分发表看法，提出意见和方案。 \n　　会议从天黑一直开到了天明。伴随会议室吵嚷气氛的是外面哗哗的大雨。雨已经不断线的下了好几天。看来，一年一度的雨季提前到来了；而且雨量异常地大，据说全省所有江河的洪水都已经到了危险的程度。好在市区周围没有大河，这方面他们不必过分操心。只是市内某些街区的危房恐怕难以招架如此凶猛的雨水。田福军在会前就已宣布，等这个会一开完，市委和市政府的领导立刻分头市内各处视察水灾情况。 \n　　会议临近结束的时候，秘书进来让田福军接省委副书记吴斌的电话。 \n　　田福军赶忙走出会议室，来到隔壁电话间。 \n　　当他听完吴斌的电话后，话筒从手里滑落下来，“\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
