、松花菜，以待孔明。隐者告曰：“此间蛮洞多毒蛇恶蝎，柳花飘入溪泉之间，水不可饮；但掘地为泉，汲水饮之方可。”孔明求薤叶芸香，隐者令众军尽意采取：“各人口含一叶，自然瘴气不侵。”孔明拜求隐者姓名，隐者笑曰：“某乃孟获之兄孟节是也。”孔明愕然。隐者又曰：“丞相休疑，容伸片言：某一父母所生三人：长即老夫孟节，次孟获，又次孟优。父母皆亡。二弟强恶，不归王化。某屡谏不从，故更名改姓，隐居于此。今辱弟造反，又劳丞相深入不毛之地，如此生受，孟节合该万死，故先于丞相之前请罪。”孔明叹曰：“方信盗跖、下惠之事，今亦有之。”遂与孟节曰：“吾申奏天子，立公为王，可乎？”节曰：“为嫌功名而逃于此，岂复有贪富贵之意！”孔明乃具金帛赠之。孟节坚辞不受。孔明嗟叹不已，拜别而回。后人有诗曰：“高士幽栖独闭关，武侯曾此破诸蛮。至今古木无人境，犹有寒烟锁旧山。”\n\n    孔明回到大寨之中，令军士掘地取水。掘下二十余丈，并无滴水；凡掘十余处，皆是如此。军心惊慌。孔明夜半焚香告天曰：“臣亮不才，仰承大汉之福，受命平蛮。今途中乏水，军马枯渴。倘上天不绝大汉，即赐甘泉！若气运已终，臣亮等愿死于此处！”是夜祝罢，平明视之，皆得满井甘泉。后人有诗曰：“为国平蛮统大兵，心存正道合神明。耿恭拜井甘泉出，诸葛虔诚水夜生。”孔明军马既得甘泉，遂安然由小径直入秃龙洞前下寨。蛮兵探知，来报孟获曰：“蜀兵不染瘴疫之气，又无枯渴之患，诸泉皆不应。”朵思大王闻知不信，自与孟获来高山望之。只见蜀兵安然无事，大桶小担，搬运水浆，饮马造饭。朵思见之，毛发耸然，回顾孟获曰：“此乃神兵也！”获曰：“吾兄弟二人与蜀兵决一死战，就殒于军前，安肯束手受缚！”朵思曰：“若大王兵败，吾妻子亦休矣。当杀牛宰马，大赏洞丁，不避水火，直冲蜀寨，方可得胜。”于是大赏蛮兵。\n\n    正欲起程，忽报洞后迤西银冶洞二十一洞主杨锋引三万兵来助战。孟获大喜曰：“邻兵助我，我必胜矣！”即与朵思大王出洞迎接。杨锋引兵入曰：“吾有精兵三万，皆披铁甲，能飞山越岭，足以敌蜀�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
