见魏军远去，抚掌而笑。众官无不骇然，乃问孔明曰：“司马懿乃魏之名将，今统十五万精兵到此，见了丞相，便速退去，何也？”孔明曰：“此人料吾生平谨慎，必不弄险；见如此模样，疑有伏兵，所以退去。吾非行险，盖因不得已而用之。此人必引军投山北小路去也。吾已令兴、苞二人在彼等候。”众皆惊服曰：“丞相之机，神鬼莫测。若某等之见，必弃城而走矣。”孔明曰：“吾兵止有二千五百，若弃城而走，必不能远遁。得不为司马懿所擒乎？”后人有诗赞曰：“瑶琴三尺胜雄师，诸葛西城退敌时。十五万人回马处，土人指点到今疑。”言讫，拍手大笑，曰：“吾若为司马懿，必不便退也。”遂下令，教西城百姓，随军入汉中；司马懿必将复来。于是孔明离西城望汉中而走。天水、安定、南安三郡官吏军民，陆续而来。\n\n    却说司马懿望武功山小路而走。忽然山坡后喊杀连天，鼓声震地。懿回顾二子曰：“吾若不走，必中诸葛亮之计矣。”只见大路上一军杀来，旗上大书“右护卫使虎冀将军张苞”。魏兵皆弃甲抛戈而走。行不到一程，山谷中喊声震地，鼓角喧天，前面一杆大旗，上书“左护卫使龙骧将军关兴”。山谷应声，不知蜀兵多少；更兼魏军心疑，不敢久停，只得尽弃辎重而去。兴、苞二人皆遵将令，不敢追袭，多得军器粮草而归。司马懿见山谷中皆有蜀兵，不敢出大路，遂回街亭。\n\n    此时曹真听知孔明退兵，急引兵追赶。山背后一声炮响，蜀兵漫山遍野而来：为首大将，乃是姜维、马岱。真大惊，急退军时，先锋陈造已被马岱所斩。真引兵鼠窜而还。蜀兵连夜皆奔回汉中。却说赵云、邓芝伏兵于箕谷道中。闻孔明传令回军，云谓芝曰：“魏军知吾兵退，必然来追。吾先引一军伏于其后，公却引兵打吾旗号，徐徐而退。吾一步步自有护送也。\n\n    却说郭淮提兵再回箕谷道中，唤先锋苏顒分付曰：“蜀将赵云，英勇无敌。汝可小心提防，彼军若退，必有计也。”苏顒欣然曰：“都督若肯接应，某当生擒赵云。”遂引前部三千兵，奔入箕谷。看看赶上蜀兵，只见山坡后闪出红旗白字，上书“赵云”。苏顒急收兵退走。行不到数里，喊声大震，一彪军撞出：为首大将，挺枪跃马，大喝曰：“汝识赵\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
