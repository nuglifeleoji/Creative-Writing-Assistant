\n　　润叶撒完这个谎后，她二妈遗撼地说：“你刘阿姨昨天就给我安顿，让你明天一定到她家里去吃饭！” \n　　“以后再吃吧！你知道我和莉莉的关系，现在她得病住了院，我不去看一下，就太不近人情！” \n　　她二妈无话可说，只好同意了。 \n　　第二天一打早，田润叶就提了一个小提包，买了一张去黄原的长途汽车票，动身到她的同学杜莉莉那里去了。 \n　　当汽车一从公路上奔驰起来，车窗外辽阔的山野，山野里火红的桃花和雪白的杏花从眼前扑过时，润叶顿时觉得呼吸舒畅了一些。她想：唉，要是我此去再不回原西来，那该多好啊！原来她一直深深依恋故土，从来也没想过在外地呆个三年五载的。但现在她很愿意离开故乡，离开原西县城，到外地去不再回来！ \n　　汽车下午两点才到黄原城。她二爸当年在黄原工作的时候，她曾到这城市来过几次。她自己工作以后，也来这里为学校办过几回公务，因此对这城市并不陌生。不过，地区文化馆她可不知道在什么地方——自莉莉调到黄原后，她还没来过呢！ \n　　她出了汽车站，提着那个小提包，一路打问着，终于来到了二道街上的地区文化馆。 \n　　杜莉莉正准备到男朋友家去过节，但一看老朋友来了，高兴地喊叫说：“你怎突然从天上掉下来了？怎？给学校办事？”润叶对她说：“我没什么公事。我想你了，就来看看你。”莉莉说：“我也想你想得要命！我还梦见过你几次呢！而且在梦中，还不光是咱们两个人！” \n　　“还有谁呢”润叶问她的女朋友。 \n　　“还有你的男朋友和我的男朋友！不过，你的男朋友可不是那个李向前！怎么样？没答应那个开车的吧？” \n　　润叶苦笑着摇摇头。她本来此刻就想顺情一头扑在莉莉的怀里，向好朋友哭叙一番自己的不幸遭遇，但想她刚到，应该忍耐一下。她只是勉强装出笑脸，开玩笑问莉莉：“你的男朋友怎么样？敢不敢让姐看一下？” \n　　莉莉调皮地扬了一下头，说：“他晚上准保来！你尽管看！也帮助我审查一下！” \n　　润叶说：“我相信你的眼光……” \n　　莉莉不到朋友家吃饭去了，开始忙着自己动手做饭。润叶也想上手，但被莉莉拒挡了，说：“现在你成了客人，不象咱们在原西县了！”在原西的时候，她两个经常一块做着吃饭，有时在小学她的宿舍，有时在县文\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
