\n　　如果中午不在山里吃饭，他回家吃完饭，碗一撂，就到自留地去了。他要利用中午别人睡觉的时间来营务自己的庄稼。这一点自留地，他宝贵得不知种什么好，从庄稼到蔬菜，互相套作，边边畔畔，见缝插针。种什么都是精心谋划的——有些要补充口粮，有些要换成零用钱……他一年不知要在这块土地上洒多少汗水。不管他怎样劳累，一旦进了这个小小的天地，浑身的劲就来了。有时简直不是在劳动，而是在倾注一腔热情。是的，这里的每一种收获，都将全部属于自己。只要能切实地收获，劳动者就会在土地上产生一种艺术创作般的激情…… \n　　孙少安疯狂而贪婪地干一天活，一到晚上，如果大队不开什么会，他就倒在自己那个小土洞里睡得象死过去一般…… \n　　但一段时间来，这样劳累一天以后，他忽然睡不着了。润叶在他的眼前扰来扰去，使他无法入眠。他不时在黑暗中发出一声叹息，或者拳头在土炕上狠狠捣一下。 \n　　一切都不知如何是好。他原来想，只要他不给她回话，她就会知道他不同意——不，不是不同意，是不敢同意，她就不会再提这事了。可没想到她三一回五一回托少平捎话，让他再到城里去。他的确没功夫去城里。但主要的是，这是一件不可能的事，何必再化功夫跑那么多路去谈论呢？而且他不愿意当润叶的面说出那个“不”字来，以免让他目睹她伤心而使自己也心碎！他想他不去城里，润叶大概就会明白他的意思，不再提这事了。 \n　　可他万万没有想到，她却又跑回村子里来找他！ \n　　那天中午，他尽管内心充满矛盾和痛苦，但硬是忍着没回去。他当时想，他可能有点残忍，但一切将会因此而结束。等他们在这个问题上彻底解脱了，有机会他会慢慢给她说明一切的。 \n　　他越来越清楚，他要是答应了润叶，实际上等于把她害了。象她这样的家庭和个人条件，完全应该找个在城里工作的人，她现在年轻，一时头脑热了，要和他好。但真正要和他这样一个农民开始生活，那苦恼将会是无尽的。她会苦恼，他也会苦恼。而那时的苦恼就要比现在的苦恼不知要苦恼多少倍！ \n　　不要这样，亲爱的人！让我们还是象过去那样友爱。我会永远在心间保持对你的温暖的感情，并且象爱妹妹、爱姐姐、爱母亲一样热爱你。原谅我吧……那天，他象“受戒”一样熬过了这一个中午。中午一过，他和大家又一块开始锄地。锄了一会儿地后，他突然感觉\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
