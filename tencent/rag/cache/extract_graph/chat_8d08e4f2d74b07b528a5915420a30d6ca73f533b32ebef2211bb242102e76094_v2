The actions we have taken—”\n“Actions? What actions?” The words were pressed from Tuek with a hoarse grunting. These terrible Bene Gesserit witches! Tleilaxu behind him and a Reverend Mother in front! Tuek felt like a ball in a fearsome game, bounced back and forth between terrifying energies. Peaceful Rakis, the secure place of his daily routines, had vanished and he had been projected into an arena whose rules he did not fully understand.\n“| have sent for the Bashar Miles Teg,” Odrade said. “That is all. His advance party should arrive soon. We are going to reinforce your planetary defenses.”\n“You dare to take over—”\n“We take over nothing. At your own father’s request, Teg’s people redesigned your defenses. The agreement under which this was done contains, at your father’s insistence, a clause requiring our periodic review.”\nTuek sat in dazed silence. Waff, that ominous little Tleilaxu, had heard all of this. There would be conflict! The Tleilaxu wanted a secret agreement setting melange prices. They would not permit Bene Gesserit interference.\nOdrade had spoken of Tuek’s father and now Tuek wished only that his long-dead father sat here. A hard man. He would have known how to deal with these opposing forces. He had always handled the Tleilaxu quite well. Tuek recalled listening (just as Waff listened now!) to a Tleilaxu envoy named Wose...and another one named Pook. Ledden Pook. What odd names they had.\nTuek’s confused thoughts abruptly offered up another name. Odrade had just mentioned it: 7eg/ Was that old monster still active?\nOdrade was speaking once more. Tuek tried to swallow in a dry throat as he leaned forward, forcing himself to pay attention.\n“Teg will also look into your on-planet defenses. After that rooftop fiasco—”\n“| officially forbid this interference with our internal affairs,” Tuek said. “There is no need. Our Priest Guardians are adequate to—”\n“Adequate?” Odrade shook her head sadly. “What an inadequate word, given the new circumstances on Rakis.”\n“What new circumstances?” There was terror in Tuek’s voice.\nOdrade merely sat there staring at him.\nTuek tried to force some order into his thoughts. Could she know about the Tleilaxu listening back there? Impossible! He inhaled a trembling breath. What was this about the defenses of Rakis? The defenses were excellent, he reassured himself. They had the best Ixian monitors and no-ships. More than that, it was to the advantage of all independent powers that Rakis remain equally independent as another source of the spice.\nTo the advantage of everyone except the Tleilaxu with the damnable melange overproduction from their axlotl tanks!\nThis was a shattering thought. A Tleilaxu Master had heard every word spoken in this audience chamber!\nTuek called on Shai-hulud, the Divided God, to protect him. That terrible little man back there said he spoke also for Ixians and Fish Speakers. He produced documents. Was that the “new circumstances” of which Odrade spoke? Nothing remained long hidden from the witches!\nThe High Priest could not repress a shudder at the thought of Waff: that round little head, those glittering eyes; that pug nose and those sharp teeth in that brittle smile.\nWaff looked like a slightly enlarged child until you met those eyes and heard him speak in his squeaky voice. Tuek recalled that his own father had complained of those voices: “The Tleilaxu say such terrible things in their childish voices!”\nOdrade shifted on her cushions. She thought of Waff listening out there. Had he heard enough? Her own secret listeners certainly would be asking themselves that question now. Reverend Mothers always replayed these verbal contests, seeking improvements and new advantages for the Sisterhood.\nWaff has heard enough, Odrade told herself. Time to shift the play.\nIn her most matter-of-fact tones, Odrade said: “M’Lord Tuek, someone important is listening to what we say here. Is it polite that such a person listen secretly?”\nTuek closed his eyes. She knows!\nHe opened his eyes and met Odrade’s unrevealing stare. She looked like someone who might wait through eternity for his response.\n“Polite? 1...1...”\n“Invite the secret listener to come sit with us,” Odrade said.\nTuek passed a hand across his damp forehead. His father and grandfather, High Priests before him, had laid down ritual responses for most occasions, but nothing for a moment such as this. Invite the Tleilaxu to sit here? In this chamber with ... Tuek was reminded suddenly that he did not like the smell of Tleilaxu Masters. His father had complained of that: “They smell of disgusting food!”\nOdrade got to her feet. “I would much rather look upon those who hear my words,” she said. “Shall | go myself and invite the hidden listener to—”\n“Please!” Tuek remained seated but lifted a hand to stop her. “I had little choice. He comes with documents from Fish\nSpeakers and Ixians. He said he would help us to return Sheeana to our—”\n“Help you?” Odrade looked down at the sweating priest with something akin to pity. This one thought he ruled Rakis?\n“He is of the Bene Tleilax,” Tuek said. “He is called Waff and—”\n“I know what he is called and | know why he is here, M’Lord Tuek. What astonishes me is that you would allow him to spy on—”\n“It is not spying! We were negotiating. | mean, there are new forces to which we must adjust our—”\n“New forces? Oh, yes: the whores from the Scattering. Does this Waff bring some of them with him?”\nBefore Tuek could respond, the audience chamber’s side door opened. Waff entered right on cue, two Face Dancers behind him.\nHe was told not to bring Face Dancers! Odrade thought.\n“Just you!” Odrade said, pointing. “Those others were not invited, were they, M’Lord Tuek?”\nTuek lifted himself heavily to his feet, noting the nearness of Odrade, remembering all of the terrible stories about the Reverend Mothers’ physical prowess. The presence of Face Dancers added to his confusion. They always filled him with such terrible misgivings.\nTurning toward the door and trying to compose his features into a look of invitation, Tuek said: “Only... only Ambassador Waff, please.”\nSpeech hurt Tuek’s throat. This was worse than terrible! He felt naked before these people.\nOdrade gestured to a cushion near her. “Waff is it? Please come and sit down.”\nWaff nodded to her as though he had never seen her before. How polite! With a gesture to his Face Dancers that they remain outside, he crossed to the indicated cushion but stood waiting beside it.\nOdrade saw a flux of tensions move through the little Tleilaxu. Something like a snarl flickered across his lips. He still had those weapons in his sleeves. Was he about to break their agreement?\nIt was time, Odrade knew, for Waff’s suspicions to regain all of their original strength and more. He would be feeling trapped by Taraza’s maneuverings. Waff wanted his breeding mothers! The reek of his pheromones announced his deepest fears. He carried in his mind, then, his part of their agreement—or at least a form of that sharing. Taraza did not expect Waff really to share all of the knowledge he had gained from the Honored Matres.\n“M’Lord Tuek tells me you have been... ahhh, negotiating,” Odrade said. Let him remember that word! Waff knew where the real negotiation must be concluded. As she spoke, Odrade sank to her knees, then back onto her cushion, but her feet remained positioned to throw her out of any line of attack from Waff.\nWaff glanced down at her and at the cushion she had indicated for him. Slowly, he sank onto his cushion but his arms remained on his knees, the sleeves directed at Tuek.\nWhat is he doing? Odrade wondered. Waff’s movements said he was embarked on a plan of his own.\nOdrade said: “I have been trying to impress upon the High Priest the importance of the Atreides Manifesto to our mutual—”\n“Atreides!” Tuek blurted. He almost collapsed onto his cushion. “It cannot be Atreides.”\n“A very persuasive manifesto,” Waff said, reinforcing Tuek’s obvious fears.\nAt least that was according to plan, Odrade thought. She said: “The promise of s’tori cannot be ignored. Many people equate s’tori with the presence of their god.”\nWaff sent a surprised and angry stare at her.\nTuek said: “Ambassador Waff tells me that Ixians and Fish Speakers are alarmed by that document, but | have\nreassured him that—”\n“I think we may ignore the Fish Speakers,” Odrade said. “They hear the noise of god everywhere.”\nWaff recognized the cant in her words. Was she jibing at him? She was right about the Fish Speakers, of course. They had been so far weaned from their old devotions that they influenced very little and whatever they did influence could be guided by the new Face Dancers who now led them. Tuek tried to smile at Waff. “You spoke of helping us tO”\n“Time for that later,” Odrade interrupted. She had to keep Tuek’s attention on the document that disturbed him so much. She paraphrased from the Manifesto: “Your will and your faith—your belief system—dominate your universe.”\nTuek recognized the words. He had read the terrible document. This Manifesto said God and all of His works were no more than human creations. He wondered how he should respond. No High Priest could let such a thing go unchallenged.\nBefore Tuek could find words, Waff locked eyes with Odrade and responded in a way he knew she would interpret correctly. Odrade could do no less, being who she was.\n“The error of prescience,” Waff said. “Isn’t that what this document calls it? Isn’t that where it says the mind of the believer stagnates?”\n“Exactly!” Tuek said. He felt thankful for the Tleilaxu intervention. That was precisely the core of this dangerous heresy!\nWaff did not look at him, but continued to stare at Odrade. Did the Bene Gesserit think their design inscrutable? Let her meet a greater power. She thought herself so strong! But the Bene Gesserit could not really know how the Almighty guarded the future of the Shariat!\nTuek was not to be stopped. “It assaults everything we hold sacred! And it’s being spread everywhere!”\n“By the Tleilaxu,” Odrade said.\nWaff lifted his sleeves, directing his weapons at Tuek. He hesitated only because he saw that Odrade had recognized part of his intentions.\nTuek stared from one to the other. Was Odrade’s accusation true? Or was that just another Bene Gesserit trick?\nOdrade saw Waff’s hesitation and guessed its reason. She cast through her mind, seeking an answer to his motivations.
