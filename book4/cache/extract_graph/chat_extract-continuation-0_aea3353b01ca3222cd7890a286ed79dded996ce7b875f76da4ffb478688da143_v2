面办公。徐治功在往县委走的路上，又遇到好多人和他打招呼。他支吾着应付一下，慌忙地只顾朝前走。他感觉人们都用一种异样的眼光看他。唉，说不定事情已经在城里传成一窝蜂了！ \n　　他在县委家属院张有智的家里，一直等到书记下班回来——他不能跑到机关去把徐国强的信交给他。 \n　　让徐治功大吃一惊的是，张有智一见他，热情地和他握手，并向他询问石圪节物资交流大会的情况。书记还表扬他这件事搞得很有气魄哩！ \n　　是不是张书记先稳住他，给他来点和风细雨，然后再吼雷打闪呢？徐治功在吃惊之余暗暗思忖。但他又想，张有智向来心中有事脸上就带出来了——他没有这么深的城府。治功就大胆试探着问：“张书记怎知道我们交易会的情况呢？你又没去。是不是石圪节谁来告诉你的？”“石圪节没来谁。我是听县上去过的干部回来说的。”张有智扭头对老伴说：“炒几个菜，我要和治功喝几盅！” \n　　徐治功提在喉眼的一颗心，又慢慢跌进了胸膛里。现在看，胡得福没来告他？ \n　　徐治功并不知道，对他钟情的王彩娥与他同时采取了行动，这个厉害的女人在治功走后不久——也就是他蹲在厕所里的那阵儿，立刻到后街头的食堂里找到了胡得福。她声色俱厉地警告“红烧肘子专家”；如果他要把她和徐主任的事传出去，她就马上和他弟胡得禄离婚；并且会一口咬定她和徐主任什么也没！ \n　　胖炉头屈服了。他知道弟弟对这个风骚女人爱得象宝贝蛋一样。再说，得禄年近五十，已经打了多年光榻，而这女人才三十来岁，有什么资本赌气哩！话说回来，徐治功是公社主任，也不是好惹的！ \n　　王彩娥大将风度，三称二码就把一场危机化为乌有！平心而论，我们不能不佩服又麻又辣的女人！ \n　　不过，狼狈不堪的治功同志要等回到石圪节，才能知道他已经完全摆脱了危机……现在，他正惴惴不安地和县委书记一块喝酒。当然，徐国强老汉的那封救急信眼下还不必掏出来。 \n　　乘着一点酒劲，治功便巧妙地把话题扯到了自己的工作调动上。他很动感情地对张书记诉苦说，他把老婆孩子丢到县城，已经在石圪节干了整整七年，组织应该考虑他的情况，把他调回县城工作。说到难受之处，他竟然哭了起来！张有智见状，立刻安慰这位下级说，县委知道这情况，罢了恨快会考虑他的问题……从县委书记家里出来，徐治功又立刻马不停蹄地返回到石圪节。
