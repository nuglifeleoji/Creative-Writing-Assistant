Additionally, STIROS seeks to manipulate TUEK into further testing SHEEANA, indicating a strategic effort to influence decisions regarding her role or significance. These actions collectively portray STIROS as a disruptive force, questioning established doctrines while attempting to sway TUEK's judgment for his own faction's agenda.
