He could not bring himself to call this\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. | may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—\n“My lungs taste the air of Time Blown past falling sands....”\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert—barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.\nProvided the Harkonnens hadn't managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nA scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms. Blast Shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.\nShuttle’s coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to\nremain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their soacebags over their shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.\n“Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That’s gravity, man!” “How many G’s does this place pull? Feels heavy.” “Nine-tenths of a G by the book.”\nThe crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.\n“Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where’s all the loot this place’s supposed to have?” “The Harkonnens took it with ’em!” “Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!” “Haven’t you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You scrub your ass with sand!” “Hey! Can it! The Duke!”\nThe Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.\nGurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine- string baliset clutched in the other hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.\nThe Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had called him? “Gurney, the valorous.”\nHalleck’s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip Slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed.\n“Gurney,” Leto said.\n“My Lord.” He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. “This is the last of them. I’d have preferred coming in with the first wave, but....”\n“There are still some Harkonnens for you,” the Duke said. “Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk.”\n“Yours to command, my Lord.”\nThey moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.\n“How many men can you let Hawat have?” the Duke asked.\n“Is Thufir in trouble, Sire?”\n“He’s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare—men who won't balk at a little knife work.”\n“I can let him have three hundred of my best,” Halleck said. “Where shall | send them?”\n“To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.”\n“Shall | get about it at once, Sire?”\n“In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttle’s Supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice.”\n“Our spice, m’Lord?”\n“Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime. They’ve opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us.”\n“How strong a persuasion, Sire?”\n“| want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and skills we need. The fact that they’re leaving suggests they’re not part of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.”\n“Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m’Lord.”\n“And there are some he hasn’t found. But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.”\n“Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?”\n“Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. | Suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer\ntwenty per cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens.”\n“No more than that, Sire? | know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them...well, Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.”\nLeto spoke impatiently: “Then use your own discretion in particular cases. Just remember that the treasury isn’t bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men—any with open sand experience.”\n“I understand, Sire. ‘They shall come all for violence: their faces shall Sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.’”\n“A very moving quotation,” the Duke said. “Turn your crew over to a lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will direct them. And don’t forget the men for Hawat.”\n“Three hundred of the best, Sire.” He took up his Spacebag. “Where shall | report to you when I’ve completed my chores?”\n“I’ve taken over a council room topside here. We'll hold staff there. | want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first.”\nHalleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto’s eye. “Are you anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? | thought there was a Judge of the Change here.”\n“Both open battle and secret,” the Duke said. “There'll be blood aplenty spilled here before we're through.”\n““And the water which thou takest out of the river Shall become blood upon the dry land,’” Halleck quoted.\nThe Duke sighed. “Hurry back, Gurney.”\n“Very good, m’Lord.” The whipscar rippled to his grin. “‘Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go | forth to my work.’” He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.\nLeto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual amazement—a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases...and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.\nPresently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were Safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men.\nThe Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a Signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.\nCommand must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nOver the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad’Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father’s first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They said: “O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.”\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n“Trs whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,” the Duke said, “but when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged in...other things.”\nHe knew he wasn’t holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.\nThe Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old- fashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: “Hawat told me that house was secure!”\nPaul spoke hesitantly: “I was angry, too—at first. And | blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would’ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others—including Hawat.”\n“Are you defending him?” the Duke demanded.\n“Yes,”\n“He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—”\n“He’s wise with much experience,” Paul said. “How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?”\n“I should be the one defending him,” the Duke said. “Not you.”\nPaul smiled.\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s.", " near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: “Hawat told me that house was secure!”\nPaul spoke hesitantly: “I was angry, too—at first. And | blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would’ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others—including Hawat.”\n“Are you defending him?” the Duke demanded.\n“Yes,”\n“He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—”\n“He’s wise with much experience,” Paul said. “How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?”\n“I should be the one defending him,” the Duke said. “Not you.”\nPaul smiled.\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s. “You’ve...matured lately, Son.” He lifted his hand. “It gladdens me.” He matched his son’s smile. “Hawat will punish himself. He’ll direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him.”\nPaul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the night’s blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.\nThe door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more\nleathery than ever. He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.\n“My Lord,” he said, speaking to a point over Leto’s head, “I have just learned how | failed you. It becomes necessary that | tender my resig—”\n“Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,” the Duke said. He waved to the chair across from Paul. “If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn’t count on simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training. You didn’t fail there!” He tapped the back of the empty chair. “Sit down, I say!”\nHawat sank into the chair. “But—”\n“FIL hear no more of it,” the Duke said. “The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?”\n“I asked them to wait outside while |—”\n“Call them in.”\nHawat looked into Leto’s eyes. “Sire, |—”\n“I know who my true friends are, Thufir,” the Duke said. “Call in the men.”\nHawat swallowed. “At once, my Lord.” He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: “Gurney, bring them in.”\nHalleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.\n“There’s coffee for those who want it,” the Duke said.\nHe looked over his men, thinking: They're a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.\nPresently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.\n“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “our civilization appears to’ve fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.”\nDry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.\n“I think first we’d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen,” the Duke said. “Thufir?”\nHawat glanced up. “I’ve some economic matters to go into after my general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need. They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly. They’ve sent us a gift—stillsuits of their own manufacture...maps of certain desert areas Surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind....” He glanced down at the table. “Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with\nthe Judge of the Change. They’ve also sent some incidental things—jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.”\n“You like these people, Thufir?” asked a man down the table.\nHawat turned to face his questioner. “Duncan Idaho says they’re to be admired.”\nPaul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: “Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?”\nHawat looked at Paul. “From food processing and other evidence, Idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We’ve reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.”\n“That’s something new,” Leto said.\n“It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.”\nAnother man down the table cleared his throat, asked: “Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?”\n“A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen- day journey.”\n“It appears,” the Duke said, “that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We Shouldn’t worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet—it’s always done. But to have\nthem completely outside our observation—that’s not good.”\n“You have a plan, Sire,” Hawat asked.\nThe Duke looked at Halleck. “Gurney, | want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them l'Il ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.”\n“What if the Emperor gets wind of this?” Halleck asked. “He’s very jealous of his CHOAM profits, m’Lord.”\nLeto smiled. “We'll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight that! And we'll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system. No more graft!”\nA grin twisted Halleck’s face. “Ahh, m’Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would that | could see the Baron’s face when he learns of this.”\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. “Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?”\n“Yes, my Lord. They’re being examined in detail even now. I’ve skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.”\n“Give it, then.”\n“The Harkonnens took ten billion solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.”\nA muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some\nboredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.\nHalleck murmured: “‘For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.’”\n“You see, gentlemen,” Leto said. “Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?”\nThere was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.\n“We will have to take it at the point of the sword,” Leto said. He turned to Hawat. “This’d be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and Supporting equipment have they left us?”\n“A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord,” Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. “They neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands—that everything the Harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart. We'll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it’s still working six months from now.”\n“Pretty much as we expected,” Leto said. “What’s the firm estimate on basic equipment?”\nHawat glanced at his folder. “About nine hundred and thirty harvester factories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty\nornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation...carryalls, a little under a thousand.”\nHalleck said: “Wouldn’t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?”\nThe Duke looked at Hawat. “Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?”\n“We must pursue other avenues for now,” Hawat said. “The Guild agent wasn’t really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain—one Mentat to another—that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.”\nOne of Halleck’s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: “There’s no justice in this!”\n“Justice?” The Duke looked at the man. “Who asks for justice? We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis—win or die. Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?”\nThe man stared at the Duke, then: “No, Sire. You couldn’t turn and | could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but....” He shrugged. “...we must all feel bitter at times.”\n“Bitterness | understand,” the Duke said. “But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind.”\nHalleck stirred, said: “I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as ‘Leto the Just’ and\npromise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.”\n“They don’t know yet who’s going to win this exchange,” the Duke said. “Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few", ", but....” He shrugged. “...we must all feel bitter at times.”\n“Bitterness | understand,” the Duke said. “But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind.”\nHalleck stirred, said: “I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as ‘Leto the Just’ and\npromise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.”\n“They don’t know yet who’s going to win this exchange,” the Duke said. “Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery?”\nHawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.\nA solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get a better look at it.\nPaul leaned forward, staring at the machine.\nScaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was basically a long, buglike body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.\n“This is a harvester factory,” Hawat said. “We chose one in good repair for this projection. There’s one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it’s still running... although I don’t know how...or why.”\n“If that’s the one they call ‘Old Maria,’ it belongs in a museum,” an aide said. “I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over their workers’ heads. Be good or you'll be assigned to Old Maria.”\nChuckles sounded around the table.\nPaul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the table, said: “Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?”\nQuick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No—they have to face the realities here.\n“There’re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp,” Hawat said. “Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicing’s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.”\n“Why don’t we shield them?” Paul asked.\n“According to Idaho’s report,” Hawat said, “shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We’ve the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho Saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.”\n“None at all?” Paul asked.\n“It'd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people,” Hawat said. “Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw no Shields or any indication of their use.”\n“It’s a puzzle,” the Duke said.\n“The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,” Hawat said. “They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.”\n“Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?” Paul asked.\n“It doesn’t seem likely,” Hawat said. “It’s theoretically possible, of course—a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one’s ever been able to put it to the test.”\n“We'd have heard about it before now,” Halleck said. “The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would’ve acquired such a device if it were available. And they’d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.”\n“I don’t like an unanswered question of this importance,” Leto said. “Thufir, | want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.”\n“We're already working on it, my Lord.” He cleared his throat. “Ah-h, Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn’t mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.”\nThe Duke frowned, then: “The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.”\nHawat gestured to his aide at the projector.\nThe solido-image of the harvester factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. “This is a Carryall,” Hawat said. “It’s essentially a large ‘thopter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to Spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a Sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.”\n“Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,” the Duke said.\nLaughter was abrupt and too loud.\nAn ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.\n“These ‘thopters are fairly conventional,” Hawat said. “Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded—possibly discarding the shield generator’s weight for greater range.”\n“I don’t like this de-emphasis on shields,” the Duke muttered. And he thought: /s this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won't even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: “Let’s get to the working estimate. What’ll our profit figure be?”\nHawat turned two pages in his notebook. “After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we’ve worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It’s based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear Safety margin.” He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: “Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We'll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.” He opened his eyes. “Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.”\n“We're working for a solid and permanent planetary base,” the Duke said. “We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy—especially the Fremen.”\n“Most especially the Fremen,” Hawat agreed.\n“Our supremacy on Caladan,” the Duke said, “depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it’s possible it may not. | call your attention to the lack of ‘thopter shields.” He Shook his head. “The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don’t dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.”\n“Then we'll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,” Hawat said. “Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.”\n“There it is,” the Duke said, “exactly as we expected. We’ll have to move fast with the Fremen. I'd like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.”\n“That’s not much time, Sire,” Hawat said.\n“We don’t have much time, as you well know. They'll be here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they'll ship in, Thufir?”\n“Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more, Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.”\n“Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council\nand matters will be much different—profits or no profits.”\n“We'll do our best, Sire.”\nPaul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat’s great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides. Aged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored Stain of sapho juice.\nSo much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.\n“We're presently in a war of assassins,” the Duke said, “but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what’s the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?”\n“We've eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain—perhaps a hundred people in all.”\n“These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,” the Duke said, “were they propertied?”\n“Most were well situated, my Lord—in the entrepreneur class.”\n“I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them,” the Duke said. “File copies with the Judge of the Change. We'll take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.”\nThufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. “A move worthy of your grandsire,\nmy Lord. It shames me | didn’t think of it first.”\nHalleck frowned across the table, noticing a deep scowl on Paul’s face. The others were smiling and nodding.\nIt’s wrong, Paul thought. This’// only make the others fight all the harder. They’ve nothing to gain by surrendering.\nHe knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.\n“| have been a stranger in a strange land,’” Halleck quoted.\nPaul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?\nThe Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. “Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?”\n“Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. | think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They’re all in useful categories.”\n“No more?” The Duke pursed his lips, then: “Well, pass the word along to—”\nA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke’s ear.\nLeto waved him back, said: “Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff.”\nPaul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho’s dark round face\nturned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\nIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: “We've taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band.
