The term is exemplified by figures such as Ghadhean al-Fali, who held this position of authority. Naibs govern their respective sietches, overseeing the social, political, and military affairs of their people. Their leadership is deeply rooted in Fremen tradition, and their allegiance to Leto underscores their role within the broader hierarchy of power on Arrakis. As sietch leaders, Naibs are responsible for maintaining order, enforcing tribal customs, and ensuring the survival of their communities in the harsh desert environment.
