\n　　起风了，水面的波浪涌起来；涛声和山林的喧哗响成一片。武惠良挥动双臂，发狠地用力划着，既和风浪搏斗，也好象在和命运搏斗……一直到晚上十一点钟，他才把小船泊在岸边，从土路上摸索着走下古塔山，来到清冷的黄原街头。 \n　　夜晚的大街上行人稀疏；地上的灯火和天上的星月组成了一个迷乱的世界。 \n　　他拖着沉重的步伐向家里走。他不知前面等待他的是什么。现在，他和丽丽都是硬着头皮走自己的路。也许他们都不知道接下来该怎么办。 \n　　进家之后，屋里弥漫着一股烟气和烧酒味。 \n　　丽丽也没有睡，一个人头发散乱地坐在小桌旁，正在抽烟——她是这两天才开始抽烟的。桌上还放一瓶烈性西风酒。 \n　　她对他的进来没有反应，端起酒杯仰头又灌了一口。 \n　　武惠良一言未发，也坐在小桌边。他只觉得心中一片凄苦。几天以前，这个家还是那么温暖和谐，现在却象低等旅馆的房间一般乱成一团。 \n　　乱的不是房间，是人，是人的心。 \n　　他默默无语地抽了一支烟，又接上了另一支。 \n　　丽丽站起来，从厨房里寻出一个酒杯，给他放在面前，满满倒起一杯。 \n　　他端起酒一展脖子喝了个净光。 \n　　她也喝了自己的一杯。 \n　　第三杯时，她说：“咱们干一杯吧！” \n　　他拿起酒杯，两个人当啷一碰，各自都一饮而尽。武惠良眼泪象断线的珠子一般从脸上淌下来。 \n　　“别哭……也许以后我们不会在一起吃饭了。本来我不希望那种结局，可你……我求你别哭了……” \n　　武惠良还是没说话，又灌了一杯酒。 \n　　酒没有了。 \n　　两个人木然地呆坐着。 \n　　城市已经完全寂静下来，只有春汛期的黄原河在远处发出雄浑的声响。隔壁的房里，传来男人的深沉的鼾声。 \n　　武惠良站起来，想要离开这个小桌，丽丽却伸手拽住了他的胳膊。他索性伏在饭桌上，出声地哭起来。几天里，他第一次这样无拘无束地痛哭。他哭他自己的悲惨命运；他也受不了丽丽折磨她自己！ \n　　酒力猛烈地挥发了。他离开小桌，跌跌撞撞走过去，一头倒在床上，继续哭着。 \n　　丽丽也走过来，躺在他身边，说：“你冷静点。哭解决什么问题？我们一起谈谈……对你，我一直真诚地爱�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>武惠良<|>PERSON<|>武惠良 is a character who is
