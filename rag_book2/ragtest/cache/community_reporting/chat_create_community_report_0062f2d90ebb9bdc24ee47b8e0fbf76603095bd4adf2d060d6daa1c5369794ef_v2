He was the husband of **桐原弥生子** and the father of **桐原亮司**, whom he reportedly doted on. As the proprietor of **Kirihara Pawnshop (桐原当铺)**, he was found stabbed to death in an abandoned, unfinished building in the autumn of 1973. The case remains unresolved, with key evidence including a missing **Dunhill (登喜路) lighter** and the theft of **one million yen in cash** that he had withdrawn from his bank account shortly before his death.  \n\nPrior to his murder, **桐原洋介** had financial dealings with **西本文代**, and there are allegations that he may have had inappropriate intentions toward her. Additionally, he was implicated in disturbing behavior, including **pedophilic tendencies** and an attempt to **adopt 雪穗 (Yukiho)** through a monetary transaction, which contributed to significant emotional trauma for his son, **亮司**.  \n\nThe circumstances of his death suggest premeditation, as he was discovered with **multiple stab wounds**, and the large sum of money he carried was stolen. His funeral was held shortly after the discovery of his body. Despite ongoing investigations, the case remains open, with his murder serving as a pivotal event that deeply affected those connected to him.\",26\n21,桐原当铺,\"**桐原当铺**是一家位于大阪旧街区的当铺，招牌上明确标注“桐原当铺”字样。该当铺最初由桐原家族经营，具体由桐原洋介负责运营，但其土地所有权归属于洋介的哥哥，属于借用性质，这一事实直到后来才被洋介的妻子弥生子知晓。桐原当铺与桐原亮司（洋介之子）有密切关联，亮司曾在此居住直至初中毕业。  \n\n该当铺是案件调查的重要地点，不仅因桐原洋介在此遇害，还因其与犯罪现场相距约一公里。案发当天傍晚，曾有顾客上门，但发现当铺门锁紧闭，无人回应呼叫铃。此外，当铺与西本家可能存在某种联系，西本文代（西本雪穗的母亲）偶尔会光顾，而店主桐原洋介与西本家的关系也成为调查的一部分。  \n\n洋介遇害后，当铺由店长松浦勇和老板娘弥生子暂时接管，但后续已由他人接手经营。秋吉（可能为相关人物）对桐原当铺似乎怀有特殊记忆或联系。案件调查中还涉及当铺的顾客信息，进一步凸显其关键性。  \n\n目前，桐原洋介的葬礼正在举行，标志着这一事件的后续发展。综合来看，桐原当铺不仅是家族经营的商业场所，更因凶案、人际关系及调查线索成为故事的核心地点之一。\",15\n36,松浦,\"松浦是桐原洋介典当行（桐原当铺）的一名员工，负责管理客户名册和典当品，并曾参与店铺的日常运营。他早年受雇于桐原家，对桐原家有一定恩情，曾协助桐原亮司及其母亲弥生子生活，甚至被亮司称为“恩人”。然而，松浦与桐原家的关系复杂且存在争议：一方面，他可能曾因盗用资金离职；另一方面，他后来又以生意合作者的身份重新接触桐原家。  \n\n松浦在桐原洋介命案中扮演了关键但可疑的角色。他出席了洋介的葬礼，并向侦探提供了信息，但笹垣警官怀疑他与弥生子有不正当关系，并可能在命案中提供虚假的不在场证明。此外，松浦还涉及盗版软件交易，作为中间商活动，后因行踪不明而脱离警方视线。  \n\n后续情节暗示，松浦可能曾试图勒索亮司，最终被亮司杀害。这一行为与他早期对桐原家的“恩情”形成矛盾，但也揭示了他在故事中的阴暗面——既是协助者，也是背叛者。总体而言，松浦是一个多面且充满秘密的角色，其行为动机与桐原家的悲剧紧密交织。\",14\n19,弥生子,\"**弥生子** is the wife of **桐原洋介** (the victim) and the mother of **桐原亮司**. She was married to **桐原洋介**, the owner of a pawnshop, and together they had a son, **亮司**, who was in the fifth grade at the time of the incident.  \n\nUpon discovering her husband's body, **弥生子** had a dramatic reaction, which drew attention during the investigation. She provided information to detectives but was also implicated in the family's dysfunction. Her relationship with her son, **亮司**, was strained and distant; she never fulfilled her maternal responsibilities, contributing to the family's breakdown.  \n\n**弥生子** had previously run a café, but after the business failed, she switched to operating a small eatery. Additionally, she was involved in an extramarital affair with **松浦勇**, and at the time of **桐原洋介**'s murder, she was with **松浦**, further complicating her role in the case.  \n\nIn summary, **弥生子** was a complex figure—**桐原洋介**'s wife, **亮司**'s neglectful mother, and a woman entangled in personal and financial struggles, including infidelity. Her actions and relationships played a significant role in the family's turmoil and the events surrounding the crime.\",16\n47,葬礼,\"The funeral is for **唐泽礼子 (Karasawa Reiko)**, organized and hosted by **雪穗 (Yukiho)**, who is seen dressed in mourning attire while receiving mourners. Although there is a mention of **桐原洋介 (Kirihara Yosuke)**'s funeral taking place, the primary focus of the descriptions is on **唐泽礼子**'s funeral, which is either in the preparation stage or already underway. The details suggest that **雪穗** plays a central role in the proceedings, overseeing the arrangements and attending to guests.  \n\nTo resolve any contradictions: while **桐原洋介**'s funeral is noted as occurring, the majority of the information pertains to **唐泽礼子**'s funeral, with **雪穗** as the key figure managing the event. Thus, the primary subject is **唐泽礼子**'s funeral, with **雪穗** as the organizer and host. Any reference to **桐原洋介**'s funeral appears to be incidental or concurrent but unrelated to the main event.  \n\nIn summary, the funeral is primarily for **唐泽礼子**, organized by **雪穗**, who is actively involved in receiving mourners. The mention of **桐原洋介**'s funeral does not alter the central focus on **唐泽礼子**'s service.\",5\n50,亮司,\"亮司（Ryoji）是桐原洋介和桐原弥生子的儿子，曾居住在桐原当铺直至初中毕业，后离家出走并与母亲关系疏远。高中毕业后，他彻底离开家庭，再未返回。亮司作为核心人物，曾目睹涉及父亲的 disturbing events，并在此后卷入暴力行为。  \n\n在桐原洋介遇害的案件中，亮司当时在家但未参与看店。调查期间，他被提及身处二楼，且经常通过窗户进出房屋。这一细节暗示他可能对事件知情或涉入其中。尽管部分描述强调他仅是 witness，其他信息则间接关联他与后续的暴力 acts，反映出其复杂角色。  \n\n综合来看，亮司的早年经历（如家庭疏离、离家出走）与案件中的行为（如回避看店、频繁通过窗户行动）共同勾勒出一个疏离且 potentially troubled 的形象。矛盾点集中于他在事件中的参与程度，但所有描述均确认他是桐原夫妇之子，案发时在场，且与家庭关系逐渐破裂。  \n\n（Word count: 199 / 500）\",15\n31,松浦勇,\"松浦勇是桐原当铺的店长，已在该当铺工作五年，同时也是桐原家的员工。他与桐原洋介的妻子弥生子有不正当关系，是她的情郎，并在命案发生时与她在一起。松浦勇知晓桐原洋介的恋童癖行为，并曾向弥生子透露相关信息。此外，他是一名被通缉的游戏软件盗版嫌疑犯，与笹垣的调查有关，并涉嫌盗用桐原当铺的资金。  \n\n松浦勇已失踪多年，其尸体后来在唐泽家庭院被发现，右手小指戴有一枚白金戒指。关于他的行踪存在矛盾：他声称桐原当铺当天营业至晚上七点，但有顾客证词质疑这一说法。这些矛盾可能与他的涉案行为及最终死亡有关。  \n\n综合来看，松浦勇是一个关键人物，涉及桐原家的秘密、金融犯罪、盗版活动以及一起命案，其死亡与生前行为存在密切联系。\",14\n55,布施车站,\"布施车站（布施駅）是大阪府东大阪市的一个重要交通枢纽，与多起关键事件相关联。该车站是桐原洋介生前最后一次被目击的地点，随后他遭遇谋杀。此外，布施车站也是今枝在大阪搭乘列车的地点，显示其在当地交通网络中的重要性。同时，该车站毗邻真澄公园，不仅是区域交通的核心节点，还是一张重要照片的拍摄地点。  \n\n综合来看，布施车站作为连接多个事件的地理坐标，既服务于日常通勤，也在相关案件中扮演了关键角色。其位置靠近真澄公园，进一步凸显了其在社区中的中心地位。\",2\n38,嵯峨野屋,\"嵯峨野屋 is a soba noodle restaurant frequently visited by Kirihara Yosuke, who was a regular customer. It is notably the establishment where Kirihara dined before his death. According to confirmed reports, he visited the restaurant on a Friday afternoon, around 4:00 p.m., for a meal. The restaurant thus holds significance in the timeline of events leading to Kirihara's demise.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize that 嵯峨野屋 was Kirihara's preferred soba noodle shop and the last known place he was seen dining. The details do not contradict but instead complement each other, reinforcing the restaurant's connection to Kirihara's final activities. The summary remains concise, factual, and written in the third person.\",1\n40,布施车站商店街,\"桐原洋介常去的商业区，嵯峨野屋位于此处\"\"\",1\n57,大江西六丁目,大江西六丁目 is the location of the second 和音蛋糕店 where 桐原洋介 bought fruit puddings,1\n66,第四次中东战争,\"第四次中东战争是桐原洋介与西本文代讨论的话题，涉及石油危机和经济影响\"\"\",1\n82,药店,\"药店老板曾目击桐原洋介在遇害当天傍晚独自行走\"\"\",1\n842,西本母女的公寓,,1\n840,那栋大楼,\"桐原洋介带西本雪穗进入的地点，案件发生的关键场所\"\"\",1\n498,桐原父亲的命案,\"桐原的父亲被杀害的事件，警方曾多次调查松浦、桐原亮和他母亲的不在场证明。\"\"\",4\n85,保险库,\"桐原当铺内用于存放贵重物品的坚固仓库\"\"\",2\n824,洋介,\"洋介是弥生子的丈夫，亮司的父亲。他的土地在哥哥名下，并非自己所有。洋介被杀害，案件由笹垣负责侦办。\"\"\",1\n827,小吃店,\"弥生子在天王寺经营的小吃店，条件优越无需权利金，现成装潢设备，支撑了她十四年的生活。\"\"\",1\n828,进口杂货店,\"弥生子曾与经营进口杂货的男子同居两年，后因对方需回归堺市的家庭而分手。\"\"\",1\n845,圣诞老人,,2\n48,钟表行,附近曾被小偷光顾的钟表行,1\n494,当铺,\"The **当铺** (Pawnshop) is a shop that appears to be permanently closed, with its doors shut and an atmosphere resembling ruins. It was previously operated by the **桐原家 (Kirihara family)** and employed **松浦 (Matsura)** at some point in the past. The establishment now stands inactive, carrying a sense of abandonment from its former days as a functioning business.  \n\nThis summary combines both descriptions, clarifying that the pawnshop was once run by the Kirihara family and had Matsura as an employee, but is currently non-operational with a desolate appearance. No contradictions exist between the two statements, as one describes its present state while the other provides historical context. The final description remains concise while preserving all key details.
