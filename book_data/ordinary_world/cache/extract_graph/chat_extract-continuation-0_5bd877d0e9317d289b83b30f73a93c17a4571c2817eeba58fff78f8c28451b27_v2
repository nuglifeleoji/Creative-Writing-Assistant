他竭力争取的。明摆着嘛！这会战在哪个村搞，哪个村就沾光——其它村出人出粮，给这个村子白修地！田福堂能对他徐治功不感激吗？不用说，双水村搞好了，首先是他田福堂的光荣！ \n　　治功现在盘腿坐在黑羊毛毡上，听着外面沸腾的喧闹声，情绪特别亢奋。这会战开始没多少天，他就把工作搞得如此有声有色。前几天，县革委会主任冯世宽亲自带队检查各公社的会战，在全县总结大会上，专门表扬了石圪节公社——这使得他劲头更大了！ \n　　徐主任捏灭了一个纸烟头，突然象记起了什么，扭过头问孙玉亭：“玉亭，你们村批判的那个人确定了没？”孙玉亭正修改一个民工的批判稿，赶紧停下来，说：“确定下来了！” \n　　“谁？” \n　　“田二。” \n　　“田二？”徐主任一时想不起双水村这个人是谁。 \n　　在旁边给杨高虎倒茶水的金成已经忍不住偷着笑了。 \n　　“这人平时爱说反动话！他到处散布说，世事要变了……”玉亭给徐主任解释说。 \n　　“那这当然要狠狠批判！什么成份？” \n　　“成份倒是贫下中农……平时也不好好参加劳动……”玉亭说。 \n　　“那你们以前为什么不好好批判？”徐主任有点生气了。 \n　　“这人平时疯疯魔魔的，村里人也不把他算个数……” \n　　“你说这个人名字叫什么？田二？他名字就叫田二？”“不是，名字叫田福顺。不过村里人谁也不叫他名字，就叫田二……”玉亭端起茶缸喝了一口水。他今天下午在民工灶上吃了一碗肥肉，渴得口干舌燥。 \n　　“田福顺？那和田福堂是什么关系？”徐治功敏感地问。“没什么关系，只是一个老先人，现在都不知隔多少代了……因此没什么关系！”孙玉亭说。 \n　　“那就把田二算上一个！现在人哩？”徐治功问。这时，旁边喝茶的武装专干杨高虎插嘴说：“玉亭刚给我一说，我就派民兵把这老汉带来了，现在和那十几个人关在一起，都在隔壁窑洞里。听民兵说，这老汉就是喊叫世事要变了，刚才一路上还说这话……” \n　　“时候不早了，咱们开会吧！”徐治功从炕沿上溜下来，把鞋穿上。 \n　　金成先一步把这几个人的茶缸拿到院子外面，摆在主席台上。 \n　　徐治功几个随后就出来了。等徐主任在主席台中央的一把椅子上坐定后，高虎和玉亭也共同坐在旁边的一条长板凳上。这时候，人群的嘈杂声还没有停下来。 \n　　为了让大家安静，准备大发脾气的杨高虎立刻站起来——没想到坐在另一头的孙玉亭，由\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
