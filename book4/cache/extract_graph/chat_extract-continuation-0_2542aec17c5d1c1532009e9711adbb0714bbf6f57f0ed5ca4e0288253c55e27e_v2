�股后面欠一堆帐债，有什么资格教导老子？“你甭再为金俊武小子说情了！你自己连自己屙下的都拾掇不了，你先甭说其它事，你二妈的四十块工钱我们还等着用哩！你最好先把钱给我们开了，再去管两旁世人的事！” \n　　孙玉亭俨然以一副债主的神态对他以前敬畏的侄儿说话。 \n　　孙少安气得嘴唇直哆嗦。他没想到，连无能的二爸也不把他当一回事了。 \n　　唉，也许在所有人的眼里，已认定他孙少安这辈子再也爬不起来。既然是这样，人们有什么必要尊重一个在生活中软弱无力的人呢？ \n　　孙少安一看他没本事再说服张狂的二爸，只好沉着脸从这个破墙烂院里走出来。他难受地咽着吐沫，喉骨结在不停地上下滑动。他并不计较二爸那些过分刺人的话，而更多的是为自己的处境悲哀。唉，他孙少安现在竟手无缚鸡之力了！少安下了二爸家的小土坡，半路正好碰见担水的孙卫红。他拦住妹妹，询问了她本人对自己婚事的态度。卫红很有主见地告诉大哥，她坚决要和金强成亲。 \n　　孙少安大受感动。他以前没有想到，他二爸二妈那样的人，竟生下这么个好娃娃。少安感到，卫红妹妹在骨子里有孙家的那种硬劲。 \n　　他于是给妹妹出主意说：“这是你自己的事，不管你爸你妈是什么态度，只要你本人坚决，你就按你的想法去行事！你知道，婚姻是自由的，到时候谁也挡不住你们！” \n　　卫红抹去眼角的泪水，严肃地对大哥点了点头。孙少安走出田家圪崂，淌过东拉河，直接去金家湾向俊武报告了他的努力没有任何结果。 \n　　于是，这宗亲事就暂时被搁置起来……冬至过后不久，阳历一九八二年快要结束的几天，随着西伯利亚大规模寒流的到来，黄土高原落了第一场雪。雪下了一天两夜，大地和村庄全被厚厚的积雪埋盖。田野里鸟兽绝迹，万般寂静。家家封门闭户，只有窑顶烟囱中升起一柱柱沉重呆滞的炊烟。野狗吐着血红的舌头，嘴里喷着白雾，在雪地上奔蹿。无处觅食的麻雀挤在窑檐下，饿得叽叽喳喳叫个不停…… \n　　大雪停歇的那个无风的早晨，村里人出门以后，就见金俊武和侄儿金强，黑棉袄钮扣上挂着红布条，从白雪皑皑的庙坪走过来，不管碰上大人还是娃娃，都双膝跪地磕上一头。人们朝金家湾北头望去，见俊武家的院墙上，插起一嘟噜白色\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
