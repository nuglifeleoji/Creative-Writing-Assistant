�，十年过去了，所有人的生活都发生了多么大的变化。就拿他们几个说吧，养民已经到上海去读研究生；而前不久他震惊地获悉，郝红梅带着前夫留下的孩子，竟然和他同村的另一个同学田润生结了婚，现在就生活在双水村。而他，当了一名干粗活的煤矿工人，现在受了伤，住了院，却被养民爱着的金秀爱上了……直到现在，他也不知如何与金秀谈这件事。他能感觉来，秀对他的爱是多么强烈！他不能用简单的三言两语来拒绝她，这样会伤害孩子……是的，孩子。他现在还认为秀是个孩子！但是，他又不能简单地响应她爱情的呼唤。如果是那样，那伤害的不仅是秀，还有他自己的心灵。 \n　　孙少平左思右想，不知他该怎么办。 \n　　想不出个妥当的结果，他就不能轻易对她表示什么。好在他很快就要离开省城；等离开时，说不定他能对这件事做出结论性的决定…… \n　　区长雷汉义帮他结完手续后，他就算和医院告别了。他让区长先回去，他自己还想在省城逗留几天；他知道，他还有些“事”需要处理。 \n　　雷汉义临走时，才迟疑着从衣袋里摸出两份矿上的文件给了他。 \n　　孙少平一看，这两份文件都是有关他自己的。一份是通报表彰他舍己救人的献身精神；另一份是批评他作为班长，元旦那天让喝醉酒的工人下井，违反了规章制度，决定给他记大过一次。 \n　　孙少平把两份文件揉成一团，塞进了自己的衣袋里。雷汉义安慰他说：“不管是表彰，还是处分，都是些球！回去只管掏咱的炭！” \n　　但孙少平的心情却是沉重的。这是一种永远不能互相抵消的存在，就象他五官正常的脸上那道丑陋的疤痕。他倒并不特别看重这两份让他哭笑不得的文件，而是由此伤感地想到，这正好说明了他那负重前行的生存处境。 \n　　仲平竭力要求出院后的少平到他家去。但他谢绝了。兰香理解二哥的心情，也没有再坚持。少平随即住进了一家个体户开办的小旅店。 \n　　他住进旅店后的第一件事，就是给惠英和明明写了一封信，告诉他什么时候回大牙湾煤矿。 \n　　几天之后，在少平即将离开省城的时刻，金秀和兰香相跟着来旅店找他，想陪他出去到街上转转。但少平推诿着不想去。最少在眼下，他不愿带着脸上的疤痕，和任何女性相跟着逛大街，他无法忍受陌生人用异样的目光看他和身边两个漂亮的妹妹。说实话，对脸上的那道疤痕，尽管他显得不在乎，但内心却为此而万般痛苦，爱美之心人人有，更何况，他正当青春年华！至于他的�\n######################\nOutput:",
