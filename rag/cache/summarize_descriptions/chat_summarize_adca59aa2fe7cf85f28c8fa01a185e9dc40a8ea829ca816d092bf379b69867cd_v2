The cave also provided refuge, acting as a **hideout during sandstorms** and a **secure shelter** to evade Harkonnen patrols.  \n\nDuring Paul Atreides' time with the Fremen, the Cave of Birds became a **strategic command post** where he planned his campaign against the Harkonnens. It also served as a **hidden sanctuary** where Paul was kept safe from enemy forces. Additionally, the cave held spiritual significance as the site where Paul underwent the **test of the Water of Life**, a pivotal moment in his transformation.  \n\nThough some accounts suggest the cave **no longer exists**, its legacy endures as a key location in Fremen history and Paul’s rise to power.
