一将，手提大刀，引着千余军。乃曹仁部将淳于导，拿住糜竺，正要解去献功。赵云大喝一声，挺枪纵马，直取淳于导。导抵敌不住，被云一枪刺落马下，向前救了糜竺，夺得马二匹。云请甘夫人上马，杀开条大路，直送至长坂城。只见张飞横矛立马于桥上，大叫：“子龙！你如何反我哥哥？”云曰：“我寻不见主母与小主人，因此落后，何言反耶？”飞曰：“若非简雍先来报信，我今见你，怎肯干休也！”云曰：“主公在何处？”飞曰：“只在前面不远。”云谓糜竺曰：“糜子仲保甘夫人先行，待我仍往寻糜夫人与小主人去。”言罢，引数骑再回旧路。\n\n    正走之间，见一将手提铁枪，背着一口剑，引十数骑跃马而来。赵云更不打话，直取那将。交马只一合，把那将一枪刺倒，从骑皆走。原来那将乃曹操随身背剑之将夏侯恩也。曹操有宝剑二口：一名“倚天”，一名“青釭”；倚天剑自佩之，青釭剑令夏侯恩佩之。那青釭剑砍铁如泥，锋利无比。当时夏侯恩自恃勇力，背着曹操，只顾引人抢夺掳掠。不想撞着赵云，被他一枪刺死，夺了那口剑，看靶上有金嵌“青釭”二字，方知是宝剑也。云插剑提枪，复杀入重围，回顾手下从骑，已没一人，只剩得孤身。云并无半点退心，只顾往来寻觅；但逢百姓，便问糜夫人消息。忽一人指曰：“夫人抱着孩儿，左腿上着了枪，行走不得，只在前面墙缺内坐地。”\n\n    赵云听了，连忙追寻。只见一个人家，被火烧坏土墙，糜夫人抱着阿斗，坐于墙下枯井之傍啼哭。云急下马伏地而拜。夫人曰：“妾得见将军，阿斗有命矣。望将军可怜他父亲飘荡半世，只有这点骨血。将军可护持此子，教他得见父面，妾死无恨！”云曰：“夫人受难，云之罪也。不必多言，请夫人上马。云自步行死战，保夫人透出重围。”糜夫人曰：“不可！将军岂可无马！此子全赖将军保护。妾已重伤，死何足惜！望将军速抱此子前去，勿以妾为累也。”云曰：“喊声将近，追兵已至，请夫人速速上马。”糜夫人曰：“妾身委实难去。休得两误。”乃将阿斗递与赵云曰：“此子性命全在将军身上！”赵云三回五次请夫人上马，夫人只不肯上马。四边喊声又起。云厉声曰：“夫人不听吾言，追军若至，为之奈何？”糜�\n######################\nOutput:",
