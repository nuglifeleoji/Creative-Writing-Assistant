She serves as a key advisor to **Mother Superior Odrade**, participating in strategic discussions, internal politics, and critical decision-making within the Sisterhood. As a **Mentat-Archivist**, she oversees sensitive records, including breeding programs and historical data, and enforces discipline among the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nBellonda is deeply skeptical and conservative, frequently opposing Odrade’s leadership and expressing concerns about the Sisterhood’s future. She distrusts **Duncan Idaho**, suspecting him of hidden motives, and questions alliances with the **Tleilaxu**. Her interactions with Idaho are tense, marked by accusations and logical scrutiny. She also harbors reservations about **Murbella**, doubting her commitment to the Sisterhood, though she assists in Murbella’s **Agony** and transition to power, administering transformative substances and guiding her through Bene Gesserit teachings.  \n\nDespite her contentious nature, Bellonda is loyal to the Sisterhood.

Her role extends to administrative duties, delaying orders when necessary and monitoring dissent. She is part of the **triumvirate** and accompanies Odrade on inspections, acting as a **Senior Watchdog** to ensure operational integrity.  \n\nBellonda’s personality is caustic and no-nonsense, with a penchant for admonishing others and upholding tradition. However, under **Sheeana’s** influence, she undergoes personal changes, improving her appearance and tempering some of her rigidity. Though often at odds with Odrade, she remains a vital figure in the Bene Gesserit, balancing her viciousness with a deep commitment to the Sisterhood’s survival.  \n\nIn summary, Bellonda is a complex, formidable presence—simultaneously a **strategist, archivist, enforcer, and skeptic**—whose actions and decisions shape the Bene Gesserit’s path amid political and existential threats.\",20\r\n1221,FOLDSPACE,\"A theoretical or technological concept related to space travel and multiple universes, discussed by Bellonda.\"\"\",1\r\n1255,TERSIUS HELEN ANTEAC,\"Tersius Helen Anteac is an ancestor of Bellonda and a Bene Gesserit who guided Bellonda through simulflow.\"\"\",1\r\n1277,TAM,\"**Summary of TAM:**  \n\nTAM is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, actively involved in overseeing and evaluating Odrade’s meetings and decisions within the order.

At times, Bellonda’s opposition is so vehement that she even considers Odrade a traitor to the Sisterhood’s principles.
