和斗铠相关的副职业课程怎么选你也要想好了，以你的精神力，我建议你选择斗铠设计。好了，老师先走了。下学期，你们的斗铠课也是我上。”\n\n    “哦，谢谢季老师。”不知道为什么，听到斗铠课是这位季老师上的时候，蓝轩宇心中有些为同学们感到悲哀。\n\n    魂兽知识相对来说还不是那么重要的，可斗铠知识的重要性可想而知，要知道，几乎全班学员都选择了双甲流啊。\n\n    而他们心目中的大魔王，却正是斗铠课的任教老师，那么……\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百一十四章 再次测试\n\n    季洪彬没再理会银天凡，扭头就走了。\n\n    银天凡气得在房间里转了三圈，然后目光灼灼地看向蓝轩宇。\n\n    “老师……”蓝轩宇被他看得有些心虚。\n\n    银天凡突然笑了，笑眯眯地道：“你看，老师们都这么看好你，所以，你要更加努力才行。以后，一定要给老师争脸啊！老师这辈子是完蛋了，你是我这些年来遇到的最好的苗子，就靠你了。”\n\n    蓝轩宇虽然不明白银天凡说的“争脸”是什么意思，但还是懵懂地点了点头。\n\n    “今天我们加练，再来一次。”银天凡一边说着，一边将蓝轩宇按回了模拟舱。\n\n    蓝轩宇心头颤抖，一天两次啊，这还从来没有过啊！此时此刻，他心中在想：季老师，您可别再来了，大魔王还有这样的作用……\n\n    时间过得飞快，转瞬就到了期末，期末考试也随之到来。\n\n    和期中考试相比，期末考试无疑是更加重要的。原因很简单：将会有一个小组在本学期期末考试后被淘汰出局。\n\n    也就是说，高能少年班原本的三十人，将只剩下二十七人。\n\n    而且根据早就已经宣布的淘汰制，被淘汰的将是一整个小组。\n\n    也就是说，哪怕在小组之中，有谁的个人实力很强，但因为另外两名队友不够强，也有被连累从而一起被淘汰的可能。\n\n    这个规则看起来有些不近人情，可对于培养高能少年班学员们的团队精神，无疑是非常有意义的。\n\n    原本这第一学期，其他学员都不怎么紧张，实在是因为钱磊、刘锋那组太差了，是有很大的可能性被淘汰的。\n\n    可谁能想到，随着蓝轩宇的到来，在期中考试中，人家就“上岸”了。无论如何，这第一学期，他们都不会被淘汰了。\n\n    于是，问题就来了—一哪个小组会成为第一个被淘汰的小组?因此，到了期末考试前的最后一个月，大家几乎都拼了命在修炼，在努力提升实力。\n\n    谁都不想被淘汰啊！能够被选拔进高能少年班的，都是同龄人中最优秀的，他们从\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a student in the high-energy youth class,
