时，不见一人，急回报司马懿曰：“蜀兵已尽退矣。”懿跌足曰：“孔明真死矣！可速追之！”夏侯霸曰：“都督不可轻追。当令偏将先往。”懿曰：“此番须吾自行。”遂引兵同二子一齐杀奔五丈原来；呐喊摇旗，杀入蜀寨时，果无一人。懿顾二子曰：“汝急催兵赶来，吾先引军前进。”于是司马师、司马昭在后催军；懿自引军当先，追到山脚下，望见蜀兵不远，乃奋力追赶。忽然山后一声炮响，喊声大震，只见蜀兵俱回旗返鼓，树影中飘出中军大旗，上书一行大字曰：“汉丞相武乡侯诸葛亮”。懿大惊失色。定睛看时，只见中军数十员上将，拥出一辆四轮车来；车上端坐孔明：纶巾羽扇，鹤氅皂绦。懿大惊曰：“孔明尚在！吾轻入重地，堕其计矣！”急勒回马便走。背后姜维大叫：“贼将休走！你中了我丞相之计也！”魏兵魂飞魄散，弃甲丢盔，抛戈撇戟，各逃性命，自相践踏，死者无数。司马懿奔走了五十余里，背后两员魏将赶上，扯住马嚼环叫曰：“都督勿惊。”懿用手摸头曰：“我有头否？”二将曰：“都督休怕，蜀兵去远了。”懿喘息半晌，神色方定；睁目视之，乃夏侯霸、夏侯惠也；乃徐徐按辔，与二将寻小路奔归本寨，使众将引兵四散哨探。\n\n

过了两日，乡民奔告曰：“蜀兵退入谷中之时，哀声震地，军中扬起白旗：孔明果然死了，止留姜维引一千兵断后。前日车上之孔明，乃木人也。”懿叹曰：“吾能料其生，不能料其死也！”因此蜀中人谚曰：“死诸葛能走生仲达。”后人有诗叹曰：“长星半夜落天枢，奔走还疑亮未殂。关外至今人冷笑，头颅犹问有和无！”司马懿知孔明死信已确，乃复引兵追赶。行到赤岸坡，见蜀兵已去远，乃引还，顾谓众将曰：“孔明已死，我等皆高枕无忧矣！”遂班师回。一路上见孔明安营下寨之处，前后左右，整整有法，懿叹曰：“此天下奇才也！”于是引兵回长安，分调众将，各守隘口，懿自回洛阳面君去了。\n\n
