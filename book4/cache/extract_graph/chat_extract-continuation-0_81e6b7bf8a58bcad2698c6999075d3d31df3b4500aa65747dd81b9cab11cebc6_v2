就是他的骄傲！当然，他还并不满足这些。一旦有了转机，他孙少安还会把这个家营务得更好；他在这方面雄心勃勃，希望将来能和田福堂、金俊山那样的光景争个高低！至于他个人的婚姻，他这两年并不是没有考虑——他终究已经二十三岁了，象他这个年龄的农民大都已结了婚，没结婚的也基本都有了对象。他想他要找一个能吃苦的农村姑娘，和他一起创立家业。但并不是眼下就解决——这不是说现在不想娶媳妇，而是现在还娶不起。他想等少平高中毕业，不论弟弟能找个临时性工作，或者回来劳动，他就多了一个帮手，到那时再考虑自己的婚姻也不迟。最使他熬煎的是，他打闹不起上千元的财礼钱。这两年也有人给他说媳妇，可没人给他说不要钱的媳妇。 \n　　现在倒好！有个拿着工资的媳妇要跟他，他可又不敢娶了…… \n　　孙少安思来想去，真想找个没人的地方，一个人抱住头痛哭一场！他多么幸福，亲爱的润叶竟然给他写了这样一封信。可他又多么不幸，他不能答应和这个爱他的也是他爱的人一块生活！ \n　　但是，他连哭鼻子的功夫也没有。家里、队里和村里的事交织在一起，乱得象“三国”一样。 \n　　他天不明就得爬起来，先要把家里的两个大水瓮担满——父亲年纪大了，已经做不成这类重活。担完水后，他又帮母亲给妹妹做饭——兰香要赶着到石圪节上第一节课。等妹妹吃完饭，金秀来叫她的时候，他还要把这两个孩子往罐子村那边送一段路。天不明，两个孩子害怕，金秀家也没个男人在家，这护卫工作只能由他承担。 \n　　送完兰香和金秀，他就赶紧折身回来，到一队饲养室院子安排全队的生产。实际上，在他到饲养室之前，就要把当天四、五十个劳力的各种活路都考虑好，然后在很短的时间里就得布置完——不能推迟出山时间！秋天的收成和几十户人家下一年的生计，就在这每一天的分分秒秒中！ \n　　队里几乎所有的社员，都常抱怨他把他们扣得太紧，简直到了残酷的程度——山里休息往往连烟瘾都过不了就又被他赶起来干活。有人甚至背后叫他“孙阎王”。但他不管这些。他想，如果不这样下苦，秋后一分粮食，你们就要骂我是“龟孙子”了。他自己先不偷懒，都是抢重头子活干。至于庄稼行里的技术，更是样样拔尖，连一些自认为老行家的人也佩服得五体投地。他在队里的权威是自然形成的。 \n　　如果中午不在山里吃饭，他回家吃完饭，碗一撂，就到自留地去了。他要利用中午别人睡觉的时间\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a hardworking farmer who
