。目光似乎失去了往日的光亮，象不起波浪的水潭一般沉静；上唇上的那一撇髭须似乎也更明显了。从那松散的腿胯可以看出，他已经成为地道的揽工汉了，和别的工匠混在一起，完全看不出差别。 \n　　两个月来，少平一直在阳沟大队曹书记家做活。书记两口子知道他原来是个教师后，对他比一般工匠都要尊重一些，还让他们领工的亲戚不要给他安排最重的活。这使孙少平对他做活的这家人产生了某种爱戴之情。一般说来，主家对自己雇用的工匠不会有什么温情——我掏钱，你干活，这没有什么可说的；而且要想办法让干活的人把力气都出尽！ \n　　既然主家对自己这么好，少平就不愿意白白领受人家这份情意。他反而主动去干最重的活，甚至还表现出了一种主人公的态度来。除过份内的事，他还帮助这家人干另外一些活。比如有时捎着担一两回水；扫扫院子，给书记家两个上学的娃娃补习功课，他一直称呼曹书记两口子叔叔婶婶。所有这一切，换来了这家人对他更多的关照。有时候，在大灶上吃完饭后，书记的老婆总设法把他留在家里，单另给他吃一点好饭食。孙少平在这期间更强烈地认识到，只要自己诚心待人，别人也才可能对自己以诚相待。体会如此重大的人生经验，对一个刚入世的青年来说，也许要比赚许多钱更为重要。 \n　　这家人一线五孔大石窑眼看就要箍起来了。 \n　　合拢口的这一天，除过雇用的工匠，阳沟队的一些村民也来给书记帮忙。少平他舅马顺也来了。 \n　　少平看见，他舅带着巴结书记的热情，争抢着背最重的合口石；由于太卖劲，不小心把手上的一块皮擦破了，赶快抓了一把黄土按在手上。 \n　　上中窑的合口石时，少平发现他舅扛上来的一块出面子料石糊了一丝血迹。按老乡俗，一般人家对新宅合拢口的石头是很讲究的，决不能沾染什么不吉利的东西，尤其是忌血。少平虽然不迷信，但出于对书记一家人的好感，觉得把一块沾血的石头放在一个最“敏感”的地方，心理上总是不美气的。 \n　　可这血迹是他舅糊上去的，而且众人谁也没有看见！ \n　　他要不要提醒一下正在旁边指手划脚的主人呢？如果说出这事来，他舅肯定会不高兴；而不说出来，他良心上对主人又有点过不去。 \n　　这时候，一个大工匠已经把那块石头抱起来，准备安放到位置上。少平不由自主地对书记说：“这石头上有点血迹……” \n　　曹书记的脸色一下子变得很难看——他显然知道这块石头是谁背上来的。他立刻喊叫下面的人提\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUN SHAOPING<|>PERSON<|>Sun Shaoping is a young man
