Historically, they are remnants of **Jacurutu**, a group infamous for its brutal practices, including water-stealing and violent rituals. While some sources suggest they act under **Leto’s orders**, others depict them as an independent and dangerous sect driven by vengeance.  \n\nTheir notoriety stems from their involvement in targeting **Paul Atreides**, whom they allegedly contaminated with **spice essence**, intensifying his prescient visions. This act underscores their hostility toward established authority and their adherence to radical Fremen ideologies. Despite conflicting accounts—some framing them as Leto’s operatives and others as outright rebels—their association with **Shuloch** and their ruthless methods remain consistent.  \n\nIn summary, the **Cast Out** are a feared Fremen offshoot, rooted in Jacurutu’s legacy, known for their extremism, revenge-driven agenda, and ties to Shuloch. Whether aligned with Leto or acting autonomously, their actions reflect a fanatical commitment to the \"\"old ways,\"\" marking them as a significant threat within the Fremen cultural and political landscape.  \n\n*(Word count: 178)*\",7\n13,FREMEN,\"The **Fremen** are the native inhabitants of **Arrakis** (also called **Dune** or **Rakis**), a fiercely independent and resilient desert-dwelling people renowned for their mastery of survival in the planet's harsh environment. Organized into tight-knit communities called **sietches** (such as **Sietch Tabr**), they adhere to strict cultural and religious traditions centered around **water conservation**, **discipline**, and **warrior codes**. Their society is deeply rooted in **Zensunni philosophy**, with rituals like the **Water Rite**, **Trial of Possession**, and reverence for **Shai-Hulud** (the sandworms).  \n\nUnder the leadership of **Naibs** like **Stilgar** and later **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)**, the Fremen became a formidable military and political force, instrumental in overthrowing the **Padishah Emperor** and the **Harkonnens**. They deified Paul as the prophesied **Mahdi**, fueling a **jihad** that reshaped the Imperium. Their guerrilla tactics, combat prowess—rivaling even the **Sardaukar**—and skills in **sandworm riding** were key to their dominance.  \n\nEcologically attuned, the Fremen possess advanced survival techniques, including **stillsuit** technology, **sandwalking**, and deep knowledge of **spice melange** production. Their long-term goal of **terraforming Arrakis** reflects their connection to the land. Over time, their society evolved under **Leto II's rule**, with some traditions fading into ceremonial roles as **Museum Fremen**, while others became divided in loyalty—some cursing the Atreides, others remaining devoted.  \n\nA people of **strict honor**, **loyalty**, and **brutal pragmatism**, the Fremen are central to the **Dune** saga—symbolizing resistance, adaptation, and the intersection of religion and power. Though their culture underwent significant changes, their legacy endures in ancestral memories and the philosophies of figures like **Duncan Idaho** and **Siona**. Their fierce independence, warrior ethos, and deep ties to the desert remain defining traits, even as their role shifts from conquerors to a people grappling with transformation.\",196\n260,STILLTENT,\"The **STILLTENT** is a portable shelter primarily used by the Fremen for survival in the harsh desert environment. Designed to withstand extreme conditions, it serves as a critical tool for conserving and reclaiming body moisture, ensuring the user's hydration in arid climates. The stilltent is often buried in the sand to provide additional insulation and protection from the elements, as evidenced by its mention in a sandslide incident. Notably, the device is not exclusive to the Fremen; figures such as Leto have also utilized it for moisture recycling in the desert. Combining functionality and portability, the stilltent remains an essential survival apparatus in desert settings, enabling its users to endure prolonged exposure to unforgiving terrain.\",3\n378,CHAKOBSA,\"**CHAKOBSA** is an ancient language primarily associated with the Fremen and the Bene Gesserit, often employed for secretive or ritualistic communication. It serves as a linguistic tool for conveying hidden meanings, as demonstrated when Jessica uses it to communicate covertly with Alia during a confrontation. Additionally, Chakobsa is integral to Fremen culture, particularly in their educational practices, where it is taught to children through rhythmic chanting. This language embodies both practical and ceremonial functions, bridging everyday communication and deeper, esoteric exchanges within Fremen and Bene Gesserit traditions.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight Chakobsa's dual role: as a means of clandestine dialogue among the Bene Gesserit and as a foundational element of Fremen pedagogy and cultural identity. Despite its varied applications, the language remains consistent in its purpose—facilitating secrecy, ritual, and cultural preservation.\",3\n500,CRYSKNIVES,\"Fremen ceremonial weapons, marking significant cultural events>\",2\n776,RASIR,\"Rasir is an old Fremen companion from the sietch days who recognizes Paul in the crowd.\"\"\",2\n894,THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN,The Preacher at Arrakeen is a figure who speaks about the Fremen's need to return to their original faith,2\n57,ALIA-OF-THE-KNIFE,\"St. Alia-of-the-Knife is a religious figure referenced in the text, possibly tied to Fremen culture.\"\"\",1\n163,ADVANCE BASES,\"Abandoned bases from the Desert Botanical Testing Station period, potentially holding valuable resources for the Atreides>\",1\n164,TIRUK,Turok is the deceased Fremen whose crysknife becomes a bond between the Atreides and Fremen>,1\n279,BYZANTINE,\"The Byzantine corruption refers to a system of bribery and deceit that the Fremen claim to reject.\"\"\",1\n307,STIL,\"Stil is a Fremen who confronts Paul and Jessica, demonstrating the Fremen's predatory nature and focus on water conservation\",1\n309,THE PILLARS OF THE UNIVERSE,\"A Fremen religious adaptation, central to their cultural and spiritual identity\",1\n317,CIELAGO,\"**CIELAGO** refers to a communication method employed by the Fremen, utilizing bat-like creatures known as *cielagos* to relay important messages. These creatures, often described as resembling bats, serve as a vital tool for the Fremen, functioning both as messengers and for surveillance purposes. While one description inaccurately refers to them as \"\"messenger birds,\"\" the consistent theme across all descriptions confirms that *cielagos* are winged, bat-like animals used for distrans messaging—a specialized form of communication. The term may also encompass the broader system of messaging involving these creatures. The Fremen rely on *cielagos* for efficient and discreet information transfer in their harsh desert environment, highlighting their adaptability and resourcefulness.  \n\nIn summary, *cielago* is a Fremen communication method centered on bat-like creatures, not birds, and includes both messaging and surveillance applications. Any discrepancies regarding their avian nature are resolved in favor of their established bat-like characteristics.\",1\n321,CAVE OF THE RIDGES,\"A temporary shelter for the Fremen, reached after a night's journey, used as a hiding place during daylight\"\"\",1\n327,FREE TRADERS,\"The free traders are intermediaries who receive spice quotas from the Fremen for trade with the Guild.\"\"\",1\n376,DEW COLLECTORS,\"Dew collectors are Fremen devices used for harvesting moisture in the desert, critical for survival.\"\"\",1\n377,PLASTICS SHOP,\"The plastics shop is a Fremen workshop where they manufacture essential items like dew collectors.\"\"\",1\n381,CRYSNIFE,\"Fremen sacred knife made from sandworm tooth, bonded to its owner.\",1\n387,NILOTIC AL-OUROUBA,\"The land from which the Fremen's Sunni ancestors fled, per Reverend Mother Ramallo.\"\"\",1\n393,BELA TEGEUSE,\"**BELA TEGEUSE**  \n\nBela Tegeuse is a planet historically linked to the Fremen, particularly as a site where Fremen slaves were forcibly relocated by Imperial raiders.

The planet is also mentioned in the Fremen prayer of parting, further cementing its association with these tragic events. While the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize Bela Tegeuse's role as a destination for Fremen slaves and its place in Fremen collective memory as a symbol of oppression and displacement. The planet serves as a reminder of the Fremen's struggles under Imperial subjugation.\",1\n422,POGROM,\"The pogrom refers to the Harkonnen raids and oppression on Arrakis.\"\"\nThe pogrom refers to the violent Harkonnen raids and oppression on Arrakis.\"\"\",1\n455,CIELAGOS,Cielagos are messenger bats used by the Fremen for communication across the desert>,1\n456,SANDWALKERS,Sandwalkers are Fremen scouts or patrols sent to traverse the desert>,1\n505,STILLSUITS,\"Fremen suits that recycle bodily water, enabling desert survival>\",1\n527,ABU ZIDE,\"Abu Zide was a Fremen mythological figure whose frigate defied the Guild.\"\"\",1\n267,AL-LAT,\"Al-Lat is a deity mentioned in the text, associated with protection from burning.\"\"\",1\n529,SHAITAN,\"Shaitan (Iblis/Satan) is a figure in Fremen mythology associated with the hurtfulness of speed.\"\"\",1\n544,SPICE MINING,,1\n639,NAVAJO INDIANS,\"The Navajo Indians are referenced as inspiration for Fremen psychedelic rituals\"\"\",1\n704,LORD LIET-KYNES,\"Liet-Kynes was the planetologist who changed Fremen traditions and promised them a paradise on Arrakis\"\"\",1\n727,SACRED PRECINCTS,\"The holy grounds around Alia's temple where violence is forbidden, yet bodies are sometimes found.\"\"\",1\n729,SIETCH ORGIES,\"Sietch orgies are Fremen communal gatherings involving rituals and ceremonies, often overseen by Reverend Mothers.\"\"\",1\n770,WATER MATTER,\"The term **\"\"Water Matter\"\"** refers to a Fremen ritual or negotiation deeply tied to the cultural and survival practices of the indigenous people of Arrakis. Water, being an extremely scarce and precious resource on the desert planet, holds immense significance in Fremen traditions. The ritual often serves as a formal means of resolving disputes, forging alliances, or conducting sacred ceremonies, all centered around the exchange or acknowledgment of water.  \n\nLichna's message invokes this tradition, highlighting its continued relevance in Fremen society. The **\"\"Water Matter\"\"** underscores the Fremen's reverence for water, not just as a physical necessity but as a spiritual and communal symbol. Whether used in tribal negotiations or sacred rites, the ritual reinforces the collective values of conservation, respect, and survival that define Fremen culture.  \n\nIn summary, the **\"\"Water Matter\"\"** is a cornerstone of Fremen tradition, embodying both practical and ceremonial aspects of water's role in their harsh environment.

It functions by generating rhythmic vibrations in the sand, mimicking the natural movements that attract the colossal creatures. The device typically consists of a short stake equipped with a spring-driven clapper, which produces the distinct thumping sounds essential for luring sandworms to the surface.  \n\nThe THUMPER's design and purpose are consistent across descriptions, emphasizing its role as a vital tool for the Fremen, who rely on sandworms for transportation, spice harvesting, and cultural rituals. While some descriptions refer to it simply as a vibration-generating device, others provide additional mechanical details, such as the spring-driven clapper. These variations do not contradict but rather complement one another, offering a more complete understanding of the THUMPER's functionality.  \n\nIn summary, the THUMPER is a compact, mechanically efficient instrument used to manipulate the behavior of sandworms through controlled vibrations, serving as an indispensable tool in Fremen society.\",3\n294,MAKER HOOKS,\"Tools mentioned in the Fremkit manual for controlling sandworms\"\"\",2\n109,CRYSKNIFE,\"The **crysknife** is a sacred and deadly weapon of the Fremen, deeply rooted in their culture and martial traditions.

Her actions reflect both her reverence for Fremen prophecies and her protective instincts toward the Atreides.  \n\nThough described in various contexts—as a servant, a cultural intermediary, and a wary informant—Shadout Mapes is consistently portrayed as a figure of wisdom and tradition, bridging Fremen customs with the political intrigues of the Atreides household.
