Aged 5 and above, they are actively involved in national conferences, where they provide input and directives to the FG system, reflecting their desires for an ideal state and responding to proposals put forth by the government. This engagement highlights their significance as citizens who express their aspirations and concerns for the future.\n\nIn the aftermath of a disaster, children under 11 years old are particularly affected, as they are scattered across a vast territory and face various crises without effective leadership or support. This situation underscores their vulnerability and the challenges they encounter in a rapidly changing environment. Despite these hardships, children over the age of eight are emerging as a crucial part of the workforce, learning quickly and contributing to recovery efforts, showcasing their resilience and adaptability.\n\nChildren also play a symbolic role in the narrative of societal change. They are depicted as witnesses to significant events, such as the observation of the Rose Nebula from the A-type building, representing the next generation that is experiencing profound transformations in the universe. This imagery emphasizes their position as both participants and observers in a world marked by loss and change.\n\nIn discussions about the future of their country, children are divided into groups with differing opinions, reflecting a spectrum of perspectives on national issues. This division illustrates their active engagement in civic matters, as they contribute suggestions for the national five-year plan, particularly advocating for the development of entertainment facilities that cater to their needs and interests.\n\nMoreover, children like Hua Hua and Xiao Meng serve as representatives of innocence and vulnerability, embodying the emotional weight of their experiences in the face of adversity. They are not only the audience for the capabilities of the FG system but also symbolize the hope and potential of the younger generation as they navigate the complexities of their environment.\n\nIn summary, children are a significant and multifaceted group within society, actively participating in national dialogues, contributing to recovery efforts, and embodying both the challenges and hopes of their generation.
