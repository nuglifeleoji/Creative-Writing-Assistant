\n　　吴月琴向来对这个人是反感的。他像《创业史》里的孙水嘴一样叫人恶心。她轻藐地一笑，指着这位文书的白衬衫说：“你在镜子里照照你自己吧！”说完便匆匆出了大门洞。杨立孝莫名其妙地看了看自己的胸前，立即脸臊得通红。他那件白衬衫是进口化肥口袋改裁的，尽管不知洗了多少遍，上面还隐隐约约看见“日本产尿素”几个字。他尴尬地对她走去的背影喊： \n　　“你不要笑话咱。咱这是延安作风！艰苦朴素……”三

\n　　几年前，她的父亲——省美术学院的副院长，被人从四层楼的隔离室推下去，然后宣布“畏罪自杀”。母亲在疾病和痛苦的折磨中也在前不久去世了。她在生活上和政治上都成了孤儿。前年考了一回大学，名列全地区第一，她高兴了一阵。但出了个张铁生，很快使她的生活又都恢复了原来的样子。祖国在受难，她也在受难。一颗孤伶仃的心又经常被社会的谗言瓷意践踏……看不见的雨丝轻柔地落在她的肩头，像有一只无形的手在轻轻地抚摸着她。夜幕垂落了，一切都隐匿在黑暗之中。雨水浸泡了的青草散发出一股甜丝丝的味道，直往鼻子里钻。这里那里，归窝的鸟儿扑楞楞地扇动着翅膀。她在熟悉的路径\n######################\nOutput:",
