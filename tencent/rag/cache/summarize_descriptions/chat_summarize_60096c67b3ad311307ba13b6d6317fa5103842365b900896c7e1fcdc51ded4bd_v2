Their relationship is multifaceted, encompassing mentorship, supervision, and strategic planning within the Sisterhood. Odrade oversees Sheeana’s development, assessing her readiness for leadership roles and potential induction into the Bene Gesserit. She carefully observes Sheeana’s reactions, curbs her impulses, and tests her abilities, reflecting both a protective and evaluative role.  \n\nOdrade has entrusted Sheeana with significant responsibilities, including leadership of Chapterhouse and the task of monitoring Waff to prevent him from following her.
