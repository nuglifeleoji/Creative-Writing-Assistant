With God’s help, | may surprise her yet.\nHe knew his body was proof against an Ixian Probe, although she obviously did not have such a cumbersome device on her person. But it was the strength of his own will and confidence in God’s grace that reassured Waff.\nAnd what if the hand they hold out to us is held out in sincerity?\nThat, too, would be God’s doing.\nAlliance with the Bene Gesserit, firm control of Rakis: What a dream that was! The Shariat ascendant at last and the Bene Gesserit as missionaries.\nWhen Sheeana again missed her footing and uttered another small sound of complaint, Odrade said: “Don’t favor yourself, child!”\nOdrade saw Waff’s shoulders stiffen. He did not like that peremptory manner with his “Blessed One.” There was backbone in the little man. Odrade recognized it as the strength of fanaticism. Even if the worm came to kill him, Waff would not flee. Faith in God’s will would carry him directly into his own death—unless he were shaken out of his religious security.\nOdrade suppressed a smile. She could follow his thinking process: God will soon reveal His Purpose.\nBut Waff was thinking about his cells growing in the slow renewal at Bandalong. No matter what happened here, his cells would carry on for the Bene Tleilax .. . and for God—a serial-Waff always serving the Great Belief.\n“I can smell Shaitan, you know,” Sheeana said.\n“Right now?” Odrade looked up at the causeway ahead of them. Waff already was a few steps onto that arching surface.\n“No, only when he comes,” Sheeana said.\n“Of course you can, child. Anyone could.”\n“I can smell him a long way off.”\nOdrade inhaled deeply through her nose, sorting the smells from the background of burnt flint: faint whiffs of melange... ozone, something distinctly acid. She motioned\nfor Sheeana to precede her single-file onto the causeway. Waff was holding his steady twenty paces ahead. The Causeway dipped down to the desert some sixty meters ahead of him.\n| will taste the sand at the first opportunity, Odrade thought. That will tell me many things.\nAs she mounted the causeway over the water moat, she looked off to the southwest at a low barrier along the horizon. Abruptly, Odrade was confronted by a compelling Other Memory. There was none of the crispness in it of actual vision, but she recognized it—a mingling of images from the deepest sources within her.\nDamn! she thought. Not now!\nThere was no escape. Such intrusions came with purpose, an unavoidable demand upon her awareness.\nWarning!\nShe squinted at the horizon, allowing the Other Memory to superimpose itself: a long-ago high barrier far away out there .. . people moving along the top of it. There was a faery bridge in that memory-distance, insubstantial and beautiful. It linked one part of that vanished barrier to another part and she knew without seeing it that a river ran beneath that long-gone bridge. The Idaho River! Now, the Superimposed image provided movement: objects falling from the bridge. They were too far away to identify but she had the labels for this image projection now. With a sense of horror and elation, she identified that scene.\nThe faery bridge was collapsing! Tumbling into the river below it.\nThis vision was not some random destruction. This was classical violence carried in many memories, which had come down to her in the moments of spice agony. Odrade could classify the finely tuned components of the image: Thousands of her ancestors had watched that scene in imaginative reconstruction. Not a real visual memory but an assemblage of accurate reports.\nThat is where it happened!\nOdrade stopped and let the image projections have their way with her awareness. Warning! Something dangerous had been identified. She did not try to dig out the warning’s substance. If she did that, she knew it could fall apart in skeins, any one of which might be relevant, but the original certainty would vanish.\nThis thing out there was fixed in the Atreides history. Leto Il, the Tyrant, had fallen to his dissolution from that faery bridge. The great worm of Rakis, the Tyrant God Emperor himself, had been tumbled from that bridge on his wedding peregrination.\nThere! Right there in the Idaho River beneath his destroyed bridge, the Tyrant had been submerged in his own agony. Right there, the transubstantiation from which the Divided God was born—it all began there.\nWhy is that a warning?\nBridge and river had vanished from this land. The high wall that had enclosed the Tyrant’s dryland Sareer was eroded into a broken line on a heat-shimmering horizon.\nIf a worm came now with its encapsulated pearl of the Tyrant’s forever-dreaming memory, would that memory be dangerous? So Taraza’s opposition in the Sisterhood argued.\n“He will awaken!”\nTaraza and her advisors denied even the possibility.\nStill, this claxon from Odrade’s Other Memories could not be shunted aside.\n“Reverend Mother, why have we stopped?”\nOdrade felt her awareness lurch back into an immediate present that demanded her attention. Out there in that warning vision was where the Tyrant’s endless dream began but other dreams intruded. Sheeana stood in front of her with a puzzled expression.\n“I was looking out there.” Odrade pointed. “That was where Shai-hulud began, Sheeana.”\nWaff stopped at the end of the causeway, one step short of the encroaching sand and now about forty paces ahead of Odrade and Sheeana. Odrade’s voice brought him to stiff alertness but he did not turn. Odrade could feel the displeasure in his posture. Waff would not like even a hint of cynicism directed at his Prophet. He always suspected cynicism from Reverend Mothers. Especially where religious matters were concerned. Waff was not yet ready to accept that the long-detested and feared Bene Gesserit might Share his Great Belief. That ground would have to be filled in with care—as was always the way with the Missionaria Protectiva.\n“They say there was a big river,” Sheeana said.\nOdrade heard the lilting note of derision in Sheeana’s voice. The child learned quickly!\nWaff turned and scowled at them. He heard it, too. What was he thinking about Sheeana now?\nOdrade held Sheeana’s shoulder with one hand and pointed with the other. “There was a bridge right there. The great wall of the Sareer was left open there to permit the passage of the Idaho River. The bridge spanned that break.”\nSheeana sighed. “A real river,” she whispered.\n“Not a qanat and too big for a canal,” Odrade said.\n“I’ve never seen a river,” Sheeana said.\n“That was where they dumped Shai-hulud into the river,” Odrade said. She gestured to her left. “Over on this side, many kilometers in that direction, he built his palace.”\n“There’s nothing over there but sand,” Sheeana said.\n“The palace was torn down in the Famine Times,” Odrade said. “People thought there was a hoard of spice in it. They were wrong, of course. He was much too clever for that.”\nSheeana leaned close to Odrade and whispered: “There is a great treasure of the spice, though. The chantings tell about it. I’ve heard it many times. My... they say it’s ina Cave.”\nOdrade smiled. Sheeana referred to the Oral History, of course. And she had almost said: “My father...” meaning her real father who had died in this desert. Odrade already had lured that story from the girl.\nStill whispering close to Odrade’s ear, Sheeana said: “Why is that little man with us? | don’t like him.”\n“It is necessary for the demonstration,” Odrade said.\nWaff took that moment to step off the causeway onto the first soft slope of open sand. He moved with care but no visible hesitation. Once on the sand, he turned, his eyes glistening in the hot sunlight, and stared first at Sheeana and then at Odrade.\nStill that awe in him when he looks at Sheeana, Odrade thought. What great things he believes he will discover here. He will be restored. And the prestige!\nSheeana sheltered her eyes with one hand and studied the desert.\n“Shaitan likes the heat,” Sheeana said. “People hide inside when it’s hot but that’s when Shaitan comes.”\nNot Shai-hulud, Odrade thought. Shaitan! You predicted it well, Tyrant. What else did you know about our times?\nWas it really the Tyrant out there dormant in all of his worm descendants?\nNone of the analyses Odrade had studied gave a sure explanation of what had driven one human being to make himself into a symbiote with that original worm of Arrakis. What went through his mind in the millennia of that awful transformation? Was any of that, even the smallest fragment, preserved in today’s Rakian worms?\n“He is near, Mother,” Sheeana said. “Do you smell him?”\nWaff peered apprehensively at Sheeana.\nOdrade inhaled deeply: a rich swelling of cinnamon on the bitter flint undertones. Fire, brimstone—the crystal-banked inferno of the great worm. She stooped and brought up a pinch of blown sand to her tongue. All of the background\nwas there: the Dune of Other Memory and the Rakis of this day.\nSheeana pointed at an angle to her left, directly into the light breeze from the desert. “Out there. We must hurry.”\nWithout waiting for permission from Odrade, Sheeana ran lightly down the causeway, past Waff and out onto the first dune. She stopped there until Odrade and Waff caught up with her. Off the dune face she led them, up another with sand clogging their passage, out along a great curving barracan with wisps of dusty saltation blowing from its crest. Soon, they had put almost a kilometer between themselves and the water-girded security of Dar-es-Balat.\nAgain, Sheeana stopped.\nWaff came to a panting halt behind her. Perspiration glistened where his stillsuit hood crossed his brow.\nOdrade stopped a pace behind Waff. She took deep, calming breaths while she peered past Waff to where Sheeana’s attention was fixed.\nA furious tide of sand had poured across the desert beyond the dune where they stood, driven by a storm wind. Bedrock lay exposed in a long narrow avenue of giant boulders, which lay scattered and upturned like the broken building blocks of a mad promethean. Through this wild maze, the sand had poured like a river, leaving its signature in deep scratches and gouges, then plunging off a low escarpment to lose itself in more dunes.\n“Down there,” Sheeana said, pointing at the avenue of bedrock. Off their dune she went, sliding and scrambling in spilled sand. At the bottom, she stopped beside a boulder at least twice her height.\nWaff and Odrade paused just behind her.\nThe slipface of another giant barracan, sinuous as the back of a sporting whale, lifted into the silver-blue sky beside them.\nOdrade used the pause to recompose her\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d3962bfb86b44706031a0af9d74da1d4b30ae533d3ba04cff4ee90427569cc77_v2"}
