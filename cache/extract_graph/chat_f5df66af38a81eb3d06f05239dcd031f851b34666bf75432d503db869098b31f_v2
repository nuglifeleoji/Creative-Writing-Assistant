Either without the other was diminished, an emptiness with lost purpose. Not better dead, perhaps, but moving aimlessly. There lay the threat of Honored Matre victory. Aimed by blind violence!\nBlind in a hostile universe.\nAnd there was why the Tyrant had preserved the Sisterhood.\nHe knew he only gave us the path without direction. A paper chase laid down by a jokester and left empty at the end.\nA poet in his own right, though.\nShe recalled his “Memory Poem” from Dar-es-Balat, a bit of jetsam the Bene Gesserit preserved.\nAnd for what reason do we preserve it? So I can fill my mind with it now? Forgetting for the moment what I may confront tomorrow?\nThe fair night of the poet,\nFill it with innocent stars.\nA pace apart Orion stands. His glare sees everything, Marking our genes forever. Welcome darkness and stare, Blinded in the afterglow. There’s barren eternity!\nSheeana felt abruptly that she had won a chance to become the ultimate artist, filled to overflowing and presented with a blank surface where she might create as she wished.\nAn unrestricted universe!\nOdrade’s words from those first childhood exposures to Bene Gesserit purpose came back to her. “Why did we fasten onto you, Sheeana? It’s really simple. We recognized in you a thing we had long awaited. You arrived and we saw it happen.”\n“It?” How naive | was!\n“Something new lifting over the horizon.”\nMy migration will seek the new. But... | must find a planet with moons.\nLooked at one way, the universe is Brownian movement, nothing predictable at the elemental level. Muad’Dib and his Tyrant son closed the cloud chamber where movement occurred.\n—STORIES FROM GAMMU\nurbella entered a time of incongruent experiences. It\nbothered her at first, seeing her own life with multiple vision. Chaotic events at Junction had ignited this, creating a jumble of immediate necessities that would not leave her, not even when she returned to Chapterhouse.\nI warned you, Dar. You can’t deny it. | said they could turn victory into defeat. And look at the mess you dumped in my lap! | was lucky to save as many as |! did.\nThis inner protest always immersed her in the events that had elevated her to this awful prominence.\nWhat else could | have done?\nMemory displayed Streggi slumping to the floor in bloodless death. The scene had played on the no-ship’s relays like a fictional drama. The projection framework in the ship’s command bay added to the illusion that this was not really happening. The actors would arise and take their bows. Teg’s comeyes, humming away automatically, missed none of it until someone silenced them.\nShe was left with images, an eerie afterglow: Teg sprawled on the floor of that Honored Matre aerie. Odrade staring in shock.\nLoud protests greeted Murbella’s declaration that she must rush groundside. The Proctors were adamant until she laid out the details of Odrade’s gamble and demanded: “Do you want total disaster?”\nOdrade Within won that argument. But you were prepared for it from the first, weren’t you, Dar? Your plan!\nThe Proctors said: “There’s still Sheeana.” They gave Murbella a one-man lighter and sent her to Junction alone.\nEven though she transmitted her Honored Matre identity ahead of her, there were touchy moments at the Landing Flat.\nA squad of armed Honored Matres confronted her as she emerged from the lighter beside a smoking pit. The smoke smelled of exotic explosives.\nWhere Mother Superior’s lighter was destroyed.\nAn ancient Honored Matre led the squad, her red robe stained, some of its decorations gone and a rip down the left shoulder. She was like some dried-up lizard, still poisonous, still with a bite but running on well-used angers, most of her energy gone. Disarrayed hair like the outer skin of a fresh- dug ginger root. There was a demon in her. Murbella saw it peering from orange-flecked eyes.\nFor all the fact that a full squad backed up the old one, the two of them faced each other as though isolated at the foot of the lighter’s drop, wild animals cautiously sniffing, trying to judge the extent of danger.\nMurbella watched the old one carefully. This lizard would dart her tongue a bit, testing the air, giving vent to her emotions, but she was sufficiently shocked to listen.\n“Murbella is my name. | was taken captive by the Bene Gesserit on Gammu. | am an adept of the Hormu.”\n“Why are you wearing a witch’s robes?” The old one and her squad stood ready to kill.\n“I have learned everything they had to teach and have brought that treasure to my Sisters.”\nThe old one studied her a moment. “Yes, | recognize your type. You're a Roc, one we chose for the Gammu project.”\nThe squad behind her relaxed slightly.\n“You did not come all the way in that lighter,” the old one accused.\n“| escaped from one of their no-ships.”\n“Do you know where their nest is?”\n“I do.”\nA wide smile spread on the old one’s lips. “Well! You area prize! How did you escape?”\n“Do you have to ask?”\nThe old one considered this. Murbella could read the thoughts on her face as though they were spoken: These ones we brought from Roc—deadlly, all of them. They can kill with hands, feet, or any other movable part of their bodies. They all should carry a sign: “Dangerous in any position.”\nMurbella moved away from the lighter, displaying the sinewy grace that was a mark of her identity.\nSpeed and muscle, Sisters. Beware.\nSome of the squad pressed forward, curious. Their words were full of Honored Matre comparisons, eager questions Murbella was forced to parry.\n“Did you kill many of them? Where is their planet? Is it rich? Have you bonded many males there? You were trained on Gammu?”\n“I was on Gammu for the third stage. Under Hakka.”\n“Hakka! I’ve met her. Did she have that injured left foot when you knew her?”\nStill testing.\n“It was the right foot and | was with her when she took the injury!”\n“Oh, yes, the right foot. | remember now. How was she injured?”\n“Kicking a lout in the rear. He had a sharp knife in his hip pocket. Hakka was so angry she killed him.”\nLaughter swept through the squad.\n“We will go to Great Honored Matre,” the old one said.\nSo I’ve passed first inspection.\nMurbella sensed reservations, though.\nWhy is this Hormu adept wearing those enemy robes? And she has a strange look to her.\nBest face that one at once.\n“I took their training and they accepted me.”\n“The fools! Did they really?”\n“You question my word?” How easy it was to revert, adopting touchy Honored Matre ways.\nThe old one bristled. She did not lose hauteur but she sent a warning look to her squad. All of them took a moment to digest what Murbella had said.\n“You became one of them?” someone behind her asked.\n“How else could | steal their knowledge? Know this! | was the personal student of their Mother Superior.”\n“Did she teach you well?” That same challenging voice from behind.\nMurbella identified the questioner: middle echelon and ambitious. Anxious for notice and advancement.\nThis is the end of you, anxious one. And little loss to the universe.\nA Bene Gesserit feint drifted the feather that was her foe into range. One Hormu-style kick for them to recognize. The questioner lay dead on the ground.\nMarriage of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre abilities creates a danger you should all recognize and envy.\n“She taught me admirably,” Murbella said. “Any other questions?”\n“Ehhhhh!” the old one said.\n“How are you called?” Murbella demanded.\n“lam a Senior Dame, Honored Matre of the Hormu. | am called Elpek.”\n“Thank you, Elpek. You may call me Murbella.”\n“lam honored, Murbella. It is indeed a treasure you have brought us.”\nMurbella studied her a moment with Bene Gesserit watchfulness before smiling without humor.\nThe exchange of names! You in your red robe that marks you as one of the powerful surrounding Great Honored\nMatre, do you know what you have just accepted into your circle?\nThe squad remained shocked and looked at Murbella with wariness. She saw this with her new sensitivity. The Old Girl network had never gained a foothold in the Bene Gesserit but it performed for Honored Matres. Simulflow amused her with a parade of confirmation. How subtle the power transfers: right school, right friends, graduation and transfer onto the first rungs of the ladder—all guided by relatives and their connections, mutual back-scratching that managed alliances, including marriages. Simulflow told her it led into the pit but ones on the ladder, the ones in controlling niches, never let that worry them.\nToday is sufficient unto today, and that is how Elpek sees me. But she does not see what I have become, only that I am dangerous but potentially useful.\nTurning slowly on one foot, Murbella studied Elpek’s squad. No bonded males here. This was too sensitive a duty for any but trusted women. Good.\n“Now, you will listen to me, all of you. If you have any loyalty to our Sisterhood, which | will judge on future performance, you will honor what | have brought. | intend it as a gift for those who deserve it.”\n“Great Honored Matre will be pleased,” Elpek said.\nBut Great Honored Matre did not appear pleased when Murbella was presented.\nMurbella recognized the tower setting. Almost sunset now but Streggi’s body still lay where it had fallen. Some of Teg’s specialists had been killed, mostly the comeye crew who doubled as his guard.\nNo, we Honored Matres do not like others spying on us.\nTeg still lived, she saw, but he was swathed in shigawire and shoved disdainfully into a corner. Most surprising of all: Odrade stood unfettered near Great Honored Matre. It was a gesture of contempt.\nMurbella felt she had lived through such a scene many times—aftermath of Honored Matre Victory: swaths of their enemies’ bodies left where they had been brought down. Honored Matre attack with the bloodless weapon had been swift and deadly, a typical viciousness that killed when killing no longer was required. She suppressed a shudder at the memory of this deadly reversal. There had been no warning, only the troops dropping in wide lines—a domino effect that left the survivors in shock. And Great Honored Matre obviously enjoyed the shock.\nLooking at Murbella, Great Honored Matre said, “So this is the bag of insolence you say you trained in your ways.”\nOdrade almost smiled at the description.\nBag of insolence?\nA Bene Gesserit would accept it without rancor. This rheumy-eyed Great Honored Matre faced a quandary and could not call on her weapon that killed without blood. Very delicate balance of power. Agitated conversations among Honored Matres had revealed their problem.\nAll of their secret weapons had been exhausted and could not be reloaded, something they had lost when driven back here.\n“Our weapon of last resort and we wasted it!”\nLogno, who thought herself supreme, stood in a different arena now. And she had just learned of the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f5df66af38a81eb3d06f05239dcd031f851b34666bf75432d503db869098b31f_v2"}
