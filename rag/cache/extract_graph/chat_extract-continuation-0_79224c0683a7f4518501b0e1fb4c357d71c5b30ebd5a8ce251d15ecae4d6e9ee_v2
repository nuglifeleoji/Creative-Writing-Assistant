Schwangyu would feel her world falling in around her. The fugitives had been gone four nights! People who could elude a Reverend Mother this way might do anything! Of course, the fugitives probably were off-planet by now. A no-ship. But what if...\nSchwangyu’s thoughts would be full of what-ifs.\nPatrin had been the fragile link but Patrin had been well trained in the removal of fragile links, trained by a master— Miles Teg.\nTeg dashed dampness from his eyes with a quick shake of his head. Immediate necessity required that core of internal honesty which he could not avoid. Teg had never been a good liar, not even to himself. Quite early in his training, he had realized that his mother and the others involved in his upbringing had conditioned him to a deep sense of personal honesty.\nAdherence to a code of honor.\nThe code itself, as he recognized its shape in him, attracted Teg’s fascinated attention. It began with recognition that humans were not created equal, that they possessed different inherited abilities and experienced different events in their lives. This produced people of different accomplishments and different worth.\nTo obey this code, Teg realized early that he must place himself accurately into the flow of observable hierarchies accepting that a moment might come when he could evolve no further.\nThe code’s conditioning went deep. He could never find its ultimate roots. It obviously was attached to something intrinsic to his humanity. It dictated with enormous power\nthe limits of behavior permitted to those above as well as to those below him in the hierarchical pyramid.\nThe key token of exchange: loyalty.\nLoyalty went upward and downward, lodging wherever it found a deserving attachment. Such loyalties, Teg knew, were securely locked into him. He felt no doubts that Taraza would support him in everything except a situation demanding that he be sacrificed to the survival of the Sisterhood. And that was right in itself. That was where the loyalties of all of them eventually lodged.\nlam Taraza’s Bashar. That is what the code says.\nAnd this was the code that had killed Patrin.\n| hope you suffered no pain, old friend.\nOnce more, Teg paused under the trees. Taking his fighting knife from its boot sheath, he scratched a small mark in a tree beside him.\n“What are you doing?” Lucilla demanded.\n“This is a secret mark,” Teg said. “Only the people | have trained know about it. And Taraza, of course.”\n“But why are you...”\n“I will explain later.”\nTeg moved forward, stopping at another tree where he made the tiny mark, a thing which an animal might make with a claw, something to blend into the natural forms of this wilderness.\nAs he worked his way ahead, Teg realized he had come to a decision about Lucilla. Her plans for Duncan must be deflected. Every Mentat projection Teg could make about Duncan’s safety and sanity required this. The awakening of Duncan’s pre-ghola memories must come ahead of any Imprint by Lucilla. It would not be easy to block her, Teg knew. It required a better liar than he had ever been to dissemble for a Reverend Mother.\nIt must be made to appear accidental, the normal outcome of the circumstances. Lucilla must never suspect opposition. Teg held few illusions about succeeding against\nan aroused Reverend Mother in close quarters. Better to kill her. That, he thought he could do. But the consequences! Taraza could never be made to see such a bloody act as obedience to her orders.\nNo, he would have to bide his time, wait and watch and listen.\nThey emerged into a small open area with a high barrier of volcanic rock close ahead of them. Scrubby bushes and low thorn trees grew close against the rock, visible as dark blotches in the starlight.\nTeg saw the blacker outline of a crawl space under the bushes.\n“It’s belly crawling from here in,” Teg said.\n“I smell ashes,” Lucilla said. “Something’s been burned here.”\n“This is where the decoy came,” Teg said. “He left a charred area just down to our left—simulating the marks of a no-ship’s take-off burn.”\nLucilla’s quickly indrawn breath was audible. The audacity! Should Schwangyu dare bring in a prescient searcher to follow Duncan’s tracks (because Duncan alone among them had no Siona blood in his ancestry to shield him) all of the marks would agree that they had come this way and fled off-planet in a no-ship ... provided...\n“But where are you taking us?” she asked.\n“It’s a Harkonnen no-globe,” Teg said. “It has been here for millennia and now it’s ours.”\nQuite naturally, holders of power wish to suppress wild research. Unrestricted questing after knowledge has a long history of producing unwanted competition. The powerful want a “safe line of investigations,” which will develop only those products and ideas that can be controlled and, most important, that will allow the larger part of the benefits to be captured by inside investors. Unfortunately, a random universe full of relative variables does not insure such a “safe line of investigations.”\n—ASSESSMENT OF IX, BENE GESSERIT ARCHIVES\nH edley Tuek, High Priest and titular ruler of Rakis, felt himself inadequate to the demands just imposed upon him.\nDust-fogged night enveloped the city of Keen, but here in his private audience chamber the brilliance of many glowglobes dispelled shadows. Even here, in the heart of the Temple, though, the wind could be heard, a distant moan, this planet’s periodic torment.\nThe audience chamber was an irregular room seven meters long and four meters at its widest end. The opposite end was almost imperceptibly narrower. The ceiling, too, made a gentle slope in that direction. Spice fiber hangings and clever shadings in light yellows and grays concealed these irregularities. One of the hangings covered a focusing horn that carried even the smallest sounds to listeners outside the room.\nOnly Darwi Odrade, the new commander of the Bene Gesserit Keep on Rakis, sat with Tuek in the audience chamber. The two of them faced each other across a narrow space defined by their soft green cushions.\nTuek tried to conceal a grimace. The effort twisted his normally imposing features into a revealing mask. He had taken great care in preparing himself for this night’s\nconfrontations. Dressers had smoothed his robe over his tall, rather stout figure. Golden sandals covered his long feet. The stillsuit under his robe was only for display: no pumps or catchpockets, no uncomfortable and time- consuming adjustments required. His silky gray hair was combed long to his shoulders, a suitable frame for his square face with its wide thick mouth and heavy chin. His eyes fell abruptly into a look of benevolence, an expression he had copied from his grandfather. This was how he had looked on entering the audience chamber to meet Odrade. He had felt himself altogether imposing, but, now, he suddenly felt naked and disheveled.\nHe’s really a rather empty-headed fellow, Odrade thought.\nTuek was thinking: / cannot discuss that terrible Manifesto with her! Not with a Tleilaxu Master and those Face Dancers listening in the other room. What ever possessed me to allow that?\n“It is heresy, pure and simple,” Tuek said.\n“But you are only one religion among many,” Odrade countered. “And with people returning from the Scattering, the proliferation of schisms and variant beliefs .. .”\n“We are the only true belief!” Tuek said.\nOdrade hid a smile. He said it right on cue. And Waff surely heard him. Tuek was remarkably easy to lead. If the Sisterhood was right about Waff, Tuek’s words would enrage the Tleilaxu Master.\nIn a deep and portentous tone, Odrade said: “The Manifesto raises questions that all must address, believers and non-believers alike.”\n“What has all this to do with the Holy Child?” Tuek demanded. “You told me we must meet on matters concerning—”\n“Indeed! Don’t try to deny that you know there are many people who are beginning to worship Sheeana. The Manifesto implicates—”\n“Manifesto! Manifesto! It is a heretical document, which will be obliterated. As for Sheeana, she must be returned to our exclusive care!”\n“No.” Odrade spoke softly.\nHow agitated Tuek was, she thought. His stiff neck moved minimally as he turned his head from side to side. The movements pointed to a wall hanging on Odrade’s right, defining the place as though Tuek’s head carried an illuminating beam to reveal that particular hanging. What a transparent man, this High Priest. He might just as well announce that Waff listened to them somewhere behind that hanging.\n“Next, you will spirit her away from Rakis,” Tuek said.\n“She stays here,” Odrade said. “Just as we promised you.”\n“But why can’t she...”\n“Come now! Sheeana has made her wishes clear and I’m sure her words have been reported to you. She wishes to be a Reverend Mother.”\n“She already is the—”\n“M’Lord Tuek! Don’t try to dissemble with me. She has stated her wishes and we are happy to comply. Why should you object? Reverend Mothers served the Divided God in the Fremen times. Why not now?”\n“You Bene Gesserit have ways of making people say things they do not want to say,” Tuek accused. “We should not be discussing this privately. My councillors—”\n“Your councillors would only muddy our discussion. The implications of the Atreides Manifesto—”\n“I will discuss only Sheeana!” Tuek drew himself up in what he thought of as his posture of adamant High Priest.\n“We are discussing her,” Odrade said.\n“Then let me make it clear that we require more of our people in her entourage. She must be guarded at all—”\n“The way she was guarded on that rooftop?” Odrade asked.\n“Reverend Mother Odrade, this is Holy Rakis! You have no rights here that we do not grant!”\n“Rights? Sheeana has become the target, yes the target! of many ambitions and you wish to discuss rights?”\n“My duties as High Priest are clear. The Holy Church of the Divided God will—”\n“M’Lord Tuek! | am trying very hard to maintain the necessary courtesies. What | do is for your benefit as well as our own. The actions we have taken—”\n“Actions? What actions?” The words were pressed from Tuek with a hoarse grunting. These terrible Bene Gesserit witches! Tleilaxu behind him and a Reverend Mother in front! Tuek felt like a ball in a fearsome game, bounced back and forth between terrifying energies. Peaceful Rakis, the secure place of his daily routines, had vanished and he had been projected into an arena whose rules he did not fully understand.\n“| have sent for the Bashar Miles Teg,” Odrade said. “That is all. His advance party should arrive soon. We are going to reinforce your planetary defenses.”\n“You dare to take over—”\n“We take over nothing. At your own father’s request, Teg’s people redesigned your defenses. The agreement under which this was done contains, at your father’s insistence, a clause requiring our periodic review.”\nTuek sat\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Patrin was a trained individual who was a fragile link, trained by Miles Teg in the removal of fragile links.
