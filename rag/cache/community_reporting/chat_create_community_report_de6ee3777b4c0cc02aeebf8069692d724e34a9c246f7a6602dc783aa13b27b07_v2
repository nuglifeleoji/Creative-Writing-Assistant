The son of **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)**, Leto II undergoes a profound physical and metaphysical transformation, merging with **sandtrout** to become a hybrid of human and sandworm. This metamorphosis grants him immense strength, longevity, and near-immortality, allowing him to rule his multigalactic empire for over **3,500 years**.  \n\nAs the **God Emperor**, Leto II enforces an era of **enforced peace** and absolute control, particularly over the **spice melange**, which is crucial to his empire's power. His rule is often perceived as tyrannical, yet it is driven by a deeper purpose: the **Golden Path**, a grand strategy designed to ensure humanity's survival and prevent stagnation. Through his **ancestral memories** and prescient vision, Leto II commits himself to this difficult course, reshaping the future of the **Fremen** and all of humankind.  \n\nContradictory accounts mention his assassination by tigers, but the dominant narrative portrays him as an enduring, nearly invulnerable ruler who willingly sacrifices his humanity to guide the universe toward a predetermined destiny.

He played a key role in approving Topri’s admission to the rebellion, though his decisions have been occasionally questioned after his death. A close and trustworthy friend of Siona, Ulot shared her enthusiasm for cryptic volumes, reflecting his intellectual curiosity.  \n\nDespite his strategic acumen, Ulot was not physically agile—described as a slow runner—which proved fatal during a mission in the Forbidden Forest. While part of a team attempting to traverse the dangerous terrain, he was ultimately caught and killed by D-wolves. His death marked the loss of a respected rebel leader and a loyal companion, leaving behind a legacy of both admiration and posthumous scrutiny.  \n\nUlot’s character was defined by his leadership, friendship, and intellectual passion, though his physical limitations led to his demise.

He is described as a tall, slender individual with black hair, embodying silent resilience. Named after an ancient Fremen title, Kwuteg demonstrates his bravery by confronting a pack of wolves (referred to as D-wolves in one account) to ensure Siona's escape. Despite suffering from an injured knee, he fights valiantly, ultimately sacrificing himself to protect her. While one description emphasizes his physical attributes—black hair and silent strength—the other highlights his role as a runner and his Fremen-inspired name. These details coalesce into a portrait of a devoted and formidable figure whose actions underscore his deep loyalty to Siona. The minor discrepancy in the description of the wolves (wolf pack vs. D-wolves) does not detract from the consistent portrayal of Kwuteg as a heroic and sacrificial guardian.\",6\n1248,RADI,\"Radi was a member of Siona's team and one of her close friends.
