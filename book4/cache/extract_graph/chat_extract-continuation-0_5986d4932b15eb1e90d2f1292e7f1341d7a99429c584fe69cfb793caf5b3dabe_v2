\n　　老汉狡猾地想起，少安还欠贺凤英的五十块工钱，要是玉亭知道少安手头有了钱，说不定会戳弄着让贺凤英向少安讨债去哩。哼！这两个没良心的东西！看不见我娃的一点死活！兄弟和儿子相比，他当然更亲自己的儿子！ \n　　这样，玉厚老汉经过一番盘算后，便趟过东拉河，在二队原来的饲养院找到了小学教师金成——原来学校的窑洞因田福堂那年打坝炸山震坏了，因此搬到了这个当年喂驴拴马的地方。他口授内容，让金成给少平写那封信。老汉当时想，金成父子有的是钱，不会为他有一千块钱就大惊小怪，传播的满村刮风下雨。再说，人家父子都是正相人家，不会干这种事…… \n　　现在，孙玉厚老汉正神不守舍地等待少平的回信。同时，他也担心：少安能不能在外县贷回那三千块钱来？几天之后，少平的回信到了。 \n　　和老汉的预料一样，懂事的娃娃满口答应了这件事；还说如果紧急，让他哥直接写信给他，他还可以在周围矿工中再给他哥转借一些钱。 \n　　这可再不敢了！怎能再逼得让二小子也欠债呢？ \n　　孙玉厚老汉立刻又跑去找到金成，给少平写信说，这里都好了。千万不敢再借人家的钱；这几个月里，也不要给家里寄钱了。老汉还在信上询问；他不是说夏天要回一趟家吗？为什么又没回来？ \n　　巧的是，少平的信刚到的第二天，少安也从原北县回来了，儿子前脚刚进门，玉厚老汉后脚就跟着进来，赶忙问：“怎样？” \n　　“贷到了！”儿子高兴地说。 \n　　“多少？”他问。 \n　　“三千。”少安说。 \n　　“还得另转借一千块……”秀莲补充说。 \n　　“这一千块钱我给你们拿来了。” \n　　玉厚老汉说着，便从衣服大襟的口袋里颤颤巍巍拿出了一捆子人民币，放在儿子家的炕席片上，他的钱从来不存银行，都在粮食囤里埋着，手伸进去就取出来了。 \n　　少安和秀莲看着父亲和炕席片上的那一捆子钱，都呆住了。 \n　　少安似乎反应过来是怎么一回事。他赶紧说：“爸爸！这钱是少平给你们箍窑的，我们怎能使用呢？” \n　　“本来，我应该领料着给你们营造地方。一来少平执意不让，说要一个人负责为你们箍窑；二来我也忙忙乱乱，紧接着又出了事，因此，至今没能为你把新地方建起来，心里一直很难过。现在，少平已经把箍窑的钱攒得差不多了，我们怎能拿这钱办砖场呢？爸爸，你把钱拿回去。我欠缺的，由我来想办法。再说，我们不言不传用了这\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
