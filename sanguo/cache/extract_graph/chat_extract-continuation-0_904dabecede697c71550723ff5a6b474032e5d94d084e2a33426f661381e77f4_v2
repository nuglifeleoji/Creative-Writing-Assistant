时有心腹将丘建在侧。建乃护军胡烈部下旧人也，时胡烈亦被监在宫。建乃密将钟会所言，报知胡烈。烈大惊，泣告曰：“吾儿胡渊领兵在外，安知会怀此心耶？汝可念何日之情，透一消息，虽死无恨。”建曰：“恩主勿忧，容某图之。”遂出告会曰：“主公软监诸将在内，水食不便，可令一人往来传递。”会素听丘建之言，遂令丘建监临。会分付曰：“吾以重事托汝，休得泄漏。”建曰：“主公放心，某自有紧严之法。”建暗令胡烈亲信人入内，烈以密书付其人。其人持书火速至胡渊营内，细言其事，呈上密书。渊大惊，遂遍示诸营知之。众将大怒，急来渊营商议曰：“我等虽死，岂肯从反臣耶？”渊曰：“正月十八日中，可骤入内，如此行之。”监军卫瓘深喜胡渊之谋，即整顿了人马，令丘建传与胡烈。烈报知诸将。\n\n    却说钟会请姜维问曰：“吾夜梦大蛇数千条咬吾，主何吉凶？”维曰：“梦龙蛇者，皆吉庆之兆也。”会喜，信其言，乃谓维曰：“器伏已备，放诸将出问之，若何？”维曰：“此辈皆有不服之心，久必为害，不如乘早戮之。”会从之，即命姜维领武士往杀众魏将。维领命，方欲行动，忽然一阵心疼，昏倒在地；左右扶起，半晌方苏。忽报宫外人声沸腾。会方令人探时，喊声大震，四面八方，无限兵到。维曰：“此必是诸将作恶，可先斩之。”忽报兵已入内。会令闭上殿门，使军士上殿屋以瓦击之，互相杀死数十人。宫外四面火起，外兵砍开殿门杀入。会自掣剑立杀数人，却被乱箭射倒。众将枭其首。维拔剑上殿，往来冲突，不幸心疼转加。维仰天大叫曰：“吾计不成，乃天命也！”遂自刎而死。时年五十九岁。宫中死者数百人。卫瓘曰：“众军各归营所，以待王命。”魏兵争欲报仇，共剖维腹，其胆大如鸡卵。众将又尽取姜维家属杀之。邓艾\n######################\nOutput:",
