What was a healthy mind, anyway?\n“Mother Superior?”\nThat damned Communications acolyte again!\n“Yes?”\n“Bellonda says to tell you immediately there has been a messenger from Buzzell. Strangers came and took all of the Reverend Mothers away.”\nOdrade whirled. “Her entire message?”\n“No, Mother Superior. The strangers are described as commanded by a woman. The messenger says she had the look of an Honored Matre but was not wearing one of their robes.”\n“Nothing from Dortujla or the others?”\n“They were not given the opportunity, Mother Superior. The messenger is a First-Stage acolyte. She came in the Small no-ship following explicit orders from Dortujla.”\n“Tell Bell that acolyte must not be allowed to leave. She has dangerous information. | will brief a messenger when | return. It must be a Reverend Mother. Do you have that?”\n“Of course, Mother Superior.” Hurt at the suggestion of doubt.\nIt was happening! Odrade contained her excitement with difficulty.\nThey have taken the bait. Now... are they on the hook?\nDortujla did a dangerous thing depending on an acolyte that way. Knowing Dortujla, that must be an extremely reliable acolyte. Prepared to kill herself if captured. | must see this acolyte. She may be ready for the Agony. And perhaps that’s a message Dortujla sends me. It would be like her.\nBell would be incensed, of course. Foolish to depend on someone from a punishment station!\nOdrade summoned a Communications team. “Set up a link with Bellonda.”\nThe portable projector was not as clear as a fixed installation but Bell and her setting were recognizable.\nSitting at my table as though she owned it. Excellent!\nNot giving Bellonda time for one of her outbursts, Odrade said: “Determine if that messenger acolyte is ready for the Agony.”\n“She is.” Gods below! That was terse for Bell.\n“Then see to it. Perhaps she can be our messenger.”\n“Already have.”\n“Is she resourceful?”\n“Very.”\nWhat in the name of all the devils has happened to Bell? She’s acting extremely odd. Not like her usual self at all. Duncan!\n“Oh, and Bell, | want Duncan to have an open link with Archives.”\n“Did that this morning.”\nWell, well. Contact with Duncan Is having its effect.\n“lII talk to you after I’ve seen Sheeana.”\n“Tell Tam she was right.”\n“About what?”\n“Just tell her.”\n“Very well. | must say, Bell, | couldn’t be more satisfied with the way you’re handling matters.”\n“After the way you've handled me, how could | fail?”\nBellonda was actually smiling as they broke the connection. Odrade turned to find Tamalane standing behind her.\n“Right about what, Tam?”\n“That there’s more to contacts between Idaho and Sheeana than we’ve suspected.” Tamalane moved close to Odrade and lowered her voice. “Don’t put her in my chair without discovering what they keep secret.”\n“I’m aware you knew my intentions, Tam. But... am | that transparent?”\n“In some things, Dar.”\n“I’m fortunate to have you as a friend.”\n“You have other supporters. When the Proctors voted, it was your creativity that worked for you. ‘Inspired’ is the way one of your defenders put it.”\n“Then you know l'Il have Sheeana on the coals quite thoroughly before | make one of my inspired decisions.”\n“Of course.”\nOdrade signaled Communications to remove the projector and went to wait at the edge of the glassy area.\nCreative imagination.\nShe knew the mixed feelings of her associates.\nCreativity!\nAlways dangerous to entrenched power. Always coming up with something new. New things could destroy the grip of authority. Even the Bene Gesserit approached creativity with misgivings. Maintaining an even keel inspired some to shunt boat-rockers aside. That was an element behind Dortujla’s posting. The trouble was that creative ones tended to welcome backwaters. They called it privacy. It had taken quite a force to bring Dortujla out.\nBe well, Dortujla. Be the best bait we ever used.\nThe ‘thopters came then—sixteen of them, pilots showing displeasure at this added assignment after all the trouble they had been through. Moving whole communities!\nIn a fragile mood, Odrade watched the ’thopters settle to the hard-glazed surface, wing fans folding back into pod sleeves—each craft like a sleeping insect.\nAn insect designed in its own likeness by a mad robot.\nWhen they were airborne, Streggi once more seated beside Odrade, Streggi asked: “Will we see sandworms?”\n“Possibly. But there are no reports of them yet.”\nStreggi sat back, disappointed by the answer but unable to lever it into another question. Truth could be upsetting at\ntimes and they had such high expectations invested in this evolutionary gamble, Odrade thought.\nElse why destroy everything we loved on Chapterhouse?\nSimulflow intruded with an image of a long-ago sign arching over a narrow entry to a pink brick building: HOSPITAL FOR INCURABLE DISEASES.\nWas that where the Sisterhood found itself? Or was it that they tolerated too many failures? Intrusive Other Memory had to have its purpose.\nFailures?\nOdrade searched it out: /f it comes, we must think of Murbella as a Sister. Not that their captive Honored Matre was an incurable failure. But she was a misfit and undergoing the deep training at a very late age.\nHow quiet they were all around her, everyone looking out at windswept sand—whaleback dunes giving way at times to dry wavelets. Early afternoon sun had just begun to provide sufficient sidelighting to define near vistas. Dust obscured the horizon ahead.\nOdrade curled up in her seat and slept. /’ve seen this before. | survived Dune.\nThe stir as they came down and circled over Sheeana’s Desert Watch Center awakened her.\nDesert Watch Center. We're at it again. We haven't really named it...no more than we gave a name to this planet. Chapterhouse! What kind of a name is that? Desert Watch Center! Description, not a name. Accent on the temporary.\nAs they descended, she saw confirmations of her thought. The sense of temporary housing was amplified by spartan abruptness in all junctures. No softness, no rounding of any connection. This attaches here and that goes over there. All joined by removable connectors.\nIt was a bumpy landing, the pilot telling them that way: “Here you are and good riddance.”\nOdrade went immediately to the room always set aside for her and summoned Sheeana. Temporary quarters:\nanother spartan cubicle with hard cot. Two chairs this time. A window looked westward onto desert. The temporary nature of these rooms grated on her. Anything here could be dismantled in hours and carted away. She washed her face in the adjoining bathroom, getting the most out of movement. She had slept in a cramped position on the ‘thopter and her body complained.\nRefreshed, she went out to a window, thankful that the erection crew had included this tower: ten floors, and this the ninth. Sheeana occupied the top floor, a vantage for doing what the name of the place described.\nWhile waiting, Odrade made necessary preparations.\nOpen the mind. Shed preconceptions.\nFirst impressions when Sheeana arrived must be seen with naive eyes. Ears must not be prepared for a particular voice. Nose must not expect remembered odors.\n| chose this one. I, her first teacher, am susceptible to mistakes.\nOdrade turned at a sound from the doorway. Streggi.\n“Sheeana has just returned from the desert and is with her people. She asks Mother Superior to meet her in the upper quarters, which are more comfortable.”\nOdrade nodded.\nSheeana’s quarters on the top floor still had that prefab look at the edges. Quick shelter ahead of the desert. A large room, six or seven times the size of the guest cubicle, but then it was both workroom and sleeping chamber. Windows on two sides—west and north. Odrade was struck by the mixture of functional and non-functional.\nSheeana had managed to make her rooms reflect herself. A standard Bene Gesserit cot had been covered with a bright orange and umber spread. A black-on-white line drawing of a sandworm, head-on with all of its crystal teeth displayed, filled an end wall. Sheeana had drawn it, relying on Other Memory and her Dune childhood to guide her hand.\nIt said something about Sheeana that she had not attempted a more ambitious rendering—full color, perhaps, and in traditional desert setting. Just the worm and a hint of sand beneath it, a tiny robed human in the foreground.\nHerself?\nAdmirable restraint and a constant reminder of why she was here. A deep impression of nature.\nNature makes no bad art?\nIt was a statement too glib to accept.\nWhat do we mean by “nature”?\nShe had seen atrocious natural wilderness: brittle trees looking as though they had been dipped in faulty green pigment and left on a tundra’s edge to dry into ugly parodies. Repellent. Hard to imagine such trees having any purpose. And blindworms . . . slimy yellow skins. Where was the art in them? Temporary stopping place on evolution’s journey elsewhere. Did the intervention of humans always make a difference? Sligs! The Bene Tleilax had produced something disgusting there.\nAdmiring Sheeana’s drawing, Odrade decided certain combinations offended particular human senses. Sligs as food were delectable. Ugly combinations touched early experiences. Experiences judged.\nBad thing!\nMuch of what we think of as ART caters to desires for reassurance. Don’t offend me! I know what I can accept.\nHow did this drawing reassure Sheeana?\nSandworm: blind power guarding hidden riches. Artistry in mystic beauty.\nIt was reported that Sheeana joked about her assignment. “I am shepherd to worms that may never exist.”\nAnd even if they did appear, it would be years before any achieved the size indicated by her drawing. Was it her voice from the tiny figure in front of the worm?\n“This will come in time.”\nAn odor of melange pervaded the room, stronger than usual in a Reverend Mother’s quarters. Odrade passed a searching look across the furnishings: chairs, worktable, illumination from anchored glowglobes—everything placed where it would serve to advantage. But what was that oddly Shaped mound of black plaz in the corner? More of Sheeana’s work?\nThese rooms fitted Sheeana, Odrade decided. Little other than the drawing to recall her origins but the view out any window might have been from Dar-es-Balat deep in Dune’s dry-lands.\nA small rustling sound at the doorway alerted Odrade. She turned and there was Sheeana. Almost shy the way she peered around the door before entering Mother Superior’s presence.\nMotion as words: “So she did come to my rooms. Good. Someone might have been careless with my invitation.”\nOdrade’s readied senses tingled with Sheeana’s presence. The youngest-ever Reverend Mother. You often thought of Quiet Little Sheeana. She was not always quiet nor was she small but the label stuck. She was not even mousy, but frequently quiet like a rodent waiting at the edge of a field for the farmer to leave. Then the mouse would come darting out to glean fallen grains.\nSheeana", " work?\nThese rooms fitted Sheeana, Odrade decided.

She was not always quiet nor was she small but the label stuck. She was not even mousy, but frequently quiet like a rodent waiting at the edge of a field for the farmer to leave. Then the mouse would come darting out to glean fallen grains.\nSheeana came fully into the room and stopped less than a pace from Odrade. “We've been too long apart, Mother Superior.”\nOdrade’s first impression was oddly jumbled.\nCandor and concealment?\nSheeana stood quietly receptive.\nThis descendant of Siona Atreides had developed an interesting face under the Bene Gesserit patina. Maturity working on her according to both Sisterhood and Atreides designs. Marks of many decisions firmly taken. The slender, dark-skinned waif with sun-streaked brown hair had become this poised Reverend Mother. Skin still dark from long hours\nin the open. Hair still sun-streaked. The eyes, though—the steely total blue that said: “I have been through the Agony.”\nWhat is it | sense in her?\nSheeana saw the look on Odrade’s face (Bene Gesserit naivete!) and knew this was the long-feared confrontation.\nThere can be no defense except my truth and I hope she stops short of a full confession!\nOdrade watched her former student with exquisite care, every sense open.\nFear! What do I sense? Something when she spoke?\nThe steadiness of Sheeana’s voice had been shaped into the powerful instrument Odrade had anticipated at their first meeting. Sheeana’s original nature (a Fremen nature if there ever was one!) had been curbed and redirected. That core of vindictiveness smoothed out. Her capacity for love and hatred brought under tight reins.\nWhy do I get the impression she wants to hug me?\nOdrade felt suddenly vulnerable.\nThis woman has been inside my defenses. No way to exclude her totally ever again.\nTamalane’s judgment came to mind: “She is one of those who keeps herself to herself Remember Sister Schwangyu? Like that one but better at it. Sheeana knows where she is going. We'll have to watch her carefully. Atreides blood, you know.”\n“I’m Atreides, too, Tam.”\n“Don't think we ever forget it! You think we’d just stand idly by if Mother Superior chose to breed on her own? There are limits to our tolerance, Dar.”\n“Indeed, this visit is long overdue, Sheeana.”\nOdrade’s tone alerted Sheeana. She stared back suddenly with that look the Sisterhood called “BG placid,” than which there probably was nothing more placid in the universe, nothing more completely a mask of what occurred behind it. This was not just a barrier, it was a nothing. Anything on this mask would be transgression. This, in itself, was betrayal.\nSheeana realized it immediately and responded with laughter.\n“I knew you would come probing! The hand-talk with Duncan, right?” Please, Mother Superior! Accept this.\n“All of it, Sheeana.”\n“He wants someone to rescue them if Honored Matres attack.”\n“That’s all?” Does she think me a complete fool?\n“No. He wants information about our intentions ... and what we're doing to meet the Honored Matre threat.”\n“What have you told him?”\n“Everything | could.” Truth is my only weapon. | must divert her!\n“Are you his friend at court, Sheeana?”\n“Yes!”\n“So am |.”\n“But not Tam and Bell?”\n“My informants tell me Bell now tolerates him.”\n“Bell? Tolerant?”\n“You misjudge her, Sheeana. It’s a flaw in you.” She is hiding something. What have you done, Sheeana?\n“Sheeana, do you think you could work with Bell?”\n“Because | tease her?” Work with Bell? What does she mean? Not Bell to head that damnable Missionaria project!\nA faint twitching lifted the corners of Odrade’s mouth. Another prank? Could that be it?\nSheeana was a prime gossip subject in Central’s dining rooms. Stories of how she teased Breeding Mistresses (especially Bell) and elaborately detailed accounts of seductions fleshed out with Honored Matre comparisons from Murbella spiced more than the food. Odrade had heard snatches of the latest story only two days ago. “She said, ‘I used the Let-him-misbehave method. Very effective with men who think they’re leading you down the garden path.\n“Tease? Is that what you do, Sheeana?”\nmu\n“An appropriate word: reshape by going against the natural inclination.” The instant the words were out of her mouth, Sheeana knew she had made a mistake.\nOdrade felt warning stillness. Reshape? Her gaze went to that odd black mound in the corner. She stared at it with a fixity that surprised her. It drank vision. She kept probing for coherence, something that spoke to her. Nothing responded, not even when she probed to her limits. And that’s its purpose!\n“It’s called ‘Void,’” Sheeana said.\n“Yours?” Please, Sheeana. Say someone else did it. The one who did this has gone where I cannot follow.\n“I did it one night about a week ago.”\nIs black plaz the only thing you reshape? “A fascinating comment on art in general.”\n“And not on art specific?”\n“I have a problem with you, Sheeana. You alarm some Sisters.” And me. There’s a wild place in you we have not found. Atreides gene markers Duncan told us to seek are in your cells. What have they given you?\n“Alarm my Sisters?”\n“Especially when they recall that you’re the youngest ever to survive the Agony.”\n“Except for Abominations.”\n“Is that what you are?”\n“Mother Superior!” She has never deliberately hurt me except as a lesson.\n“You went through the Agony as an act of disobedience.”\n“Wouldn’t you say rather that | went against mature advice?” Humor sometimes distracts her.\nPrester, Sheeana’s acolyte aide, came to the door and rapped lightly on the wall beside it until she had their attention. “You said | was to tell you immediately when the search teams returned.”\n“What do they report?”\nRelief in Sheeana’s voice?\n“Team eight wants you to look at their scans.”\n“They always want that!”\nSheeana spoke with forced frustration. “Do you want to look at the scans with me, Mother Superior?”\n“PI wait here.”\n“This won’t take long.”\nWhen they had gone, Odrade went to the western window: a clear view across rooftops to the new desert. Small dunes here. Almost sunset and that dry heat so reminiscent of Dune.\nWhat is Sheeana hiding?\nA young man, hardly more than a boy, had been sunning nude on a neighboring rooftop, face-up on a sea-green mattress with a golden towel across his face. His skin was a sun-warmed gold to match towel and pubic hair. A breeze touched a corner of the towel and lifted it. One languid hand came up and restored the cover.\nHow can he be idle? Night worker? Probably.\nIdleness was not encouraged and this was flaunting it. Odrade smiled to herself. Anyone could be excused for assuming he was a night worker. He might be depending on that specific guess. The trick would be to remain unseen by those who knew otherwise.\n/ will not ask. Intelligence deserves some rewards. And, after all, he could be a night worker.\nShe lifted her gaze. A new pattern emerging here: exotic sunsets. Narrow band of orange drawn along the horizon, bulging where the sun had just dipped below the land. Silvery blue above the orange went darker overhead. She had seen this many times on Dune. Meteorological explanations she did not care to explore. Better to let eyes absorb this transient beauty; better to permit ears and skin to feel sudden stillness descend upon this land in the quick darkness after the orange vanished.\nFaintly, she saw the young man pick up mattress and towel and vanish behind a ventilator.\nA sound of running in the corridor behind her. Sheeana entered almost breathless. “They found a spice mass thirty klicks northeast of us! Small but compact!”\nOdrade did not dare hope. “Could it be wind accumulation?”\n“Not likely. I’ve set a round-the-clock watch on it.” Sheeana glanced at the window where Odrade stood. She has seen Trebo. Perhaps...\n“I asked you earlier, Sheeana, if you could work with Bell. It was an important question. Tam is getting very old and must be replaced soon. There must be a vote, of course.”\n“Me?” It was totally unexpected.\n“My first choice.” /mperative now. | want you close where | can keep watch on you.\n“But | thought... I mean, the Missionaria’s plan...” “That can wait. And there must be someone else who can shepherd worms... if that spice mass is what we hope.”\n“Oh? Yes... several of our people but no one who... Don’t you want me to test whether the worms still respond to me?”\n“Work on the Council should not interfere with that.”\n“I... you can see I’m surprised.”\n“| would have said shocked. Tell me, Sheeana, what really interests you these days?”\nStill probing. Trebo, serve me now! “Making sure the desert grows well.” Truth! “And my sex life, of course. You saw the young man on the roof next door? Trebo, a new one Duncan sent me for polishing.”\nEven after Odrade had gone, Sheeana wondered why those words had aroused such merriment. Mother Superior had been deflected, though.\nNo need even to waste her fallback position—truth: “We've been discussing the possibility that | might imprint Teg and restore the Bashar’s memories that way.”\nFull confession avoided. Mother Superior did not learn that | have weaseled out the way to reactivate our no-ship\nprison and defuse the mines Bellonda put in it.\nNo sweeteners will cloak some forms of bitterness.

Them and their damned suggestions about Scytale and... and everything! They precipitated motion she could not control.\nTonight, she was lost in an insane world of words. The cause was Clear. Bellonda that morning had learned Murbella spoke nine languages and had aimed the Suspicious acolyte down a mental path called “Linguistic Heritage.” But Bell’s influence on this nighttime madness provided no escape.\nNightmare. She was a creature of microscopic size trapped in an enormous echoing place labeled in giant letters wherever she turned: “Data Reservoir.” Animated words with grimacing jaws and fearsome tentacles surrounded her.\nPredatory beasts and she was their prey!\nAwake and knowing she sat on the edge of her bed with Duncan’s arm on her legs, she still saw the beasts. They herded her backward. She knew she was going backward although her body did not move. They pressed her toward a terrible disaster she could not see. Her head would not turn! Not only did she see these creatures (they hid parts of her sleeping chamber) but she heard them in a cacophony of her nine languages.\nThey will tear me apart!\nAlthough she could not turn, she sensed what lay behind her: more teeth and claws. Threat all around! If they cornered her, they would pounce and she was doomed.\nDone for. Dead. Victim. Torture-captive. Fair game.\nDespair filled her. Why would Duncan not awaken and save her? His arm was a lead weight, part of the force holding her and allowing these creatures to herd her into their bizarre trap. She trembled. Perspiration poured from her body. Awful words! They united into giant combinations. A creature with knife-fanged mouth came directly toward her and she saw more words in the gaping blackness between its jaws.\nSee above.\nMurbella began to laugh. She had no control of it. See above. Done for. Dead. Victim...\nThe laughter awakened Duncan. He sat up, activated a low glowglobe, and stared at her. How tousled he looked after their earlier sexual collision.\nHis expression hovered between amusement and upset at being awakened. “Why are you laughing?”\nLaughter subsided in gasps. Her sides ached. She was afraid his tentative smile would ignite a new spasm. “Oh... oh! Duncan! Sexual collision!”\nHe knew this was their mutual term for the addiction that bound them but why would it make her laugh?\nHis puzzled expression struck her as ludicrous.\nBetween gasps, she said: “Two more words.” And she had to clamp her mouth closed to prevent another outburst.\n“What?”\nHis voice was the funniest thing she had ever heard. She thrust a hand at him and shook her head. “Ohhh... ohhh...”\n“Murbella, what’s wrong with you?”\nShe could only continue shaking her head.\nHe tried a tentative smile. It gentled her and she leaned against him. “No!” When his right hand wandered. “I just want to be close.”\n“Look what time it is.” He lifted his chin toward the ceiling projection. “Almost three.”\n“It was so funny, Duncan.”\n“So tell me about it.”\n“When | catch my breath.”\nHe eased her down onto her pillow. “We're like a damned old married couple. Funny stories in the middle of the night.”\n“No, darling, we're different.”\n“A question of degree, nothing else.”\n“Quality,” she insisted.\n“What was so funny?”\nShe recounted her nightmare and Bellonda’s influence.\n“Zensunni. Very ancient technique. The Sisters use it to rid you of trauma connections. Words that ignite unconscious responses.”\nFear returned.\n“Murbella, why are you trembling?”\n“Honored Matre teachers warned us terrible things would happen if we fell into Zensunni hands.”\n“Bullcrap! | went through the same thing as a Mentat.”\nHis words conjured another dream fragment. A beast with two heads. Both mouths open. Words in there. On the left, “One word,” and on the right, “leads to another.”\nMirth displaced fear. It subsided without laughter. “Duncan!”\n“Mmmmmmm.” Mentat distance in the sound.\n“Bell said the Bene Gesserit use words as weapons— Voice. ‘Tools of control,’ she called them.”\n“A lesson you must learn almost as instinct. They'll never trust you into the deeper training until you learn this.”\nAnd I won't trust you afterward.\nShe rolled away from him and looked at the comeyes glittering in the ceiling around the time projection.\nI’m still on probation.\nShe was aware her teachers discussed her privately. Conversations were choked off when she approached. They stared at her in their special way, as though she were an interesting specimen.\nBellonda’s voice cluttered her mind.\nNightmare tendrils. Midmorning then and the sweat of her own exertions a stink in her nostrils. Probationer a dutiful three paces from Reverend Mother. Bell’s voice:\n“Never be an expert. That locks you up tight.”\nAll of this because | asked if there were no words to guide the Bene Gesserit.\n“Duncan, why do they mix mental and physical teaching?”\n“Mind and body reinforce each other.” Sleepy. Damn him! He’s going back to sleep.\nShe shook Duncan’s shoulder. “If words are so damned unimportant, why do they talk about disciplines so much?”\n“Patterns,” he mumbled. “Dirty word.”\n“What?” She shook him more roughly.\nHe turned onto his back, moving his lips, then: “Discipline equals pattern equals bad way to go. They say we're all\nnatural pattern creators ... means ‘order’ to them, | think.” “Why is that so bad?” “Gives others handle to destroy us or traps usin... in\nthings we won’t change.”\n“You're wrong about mind and body.”\n“Hmmmmph?”\n“It’s pressures locking one to the other.”\n“Isn't that what I said? Hey! Are we going to talk or sleep or what?”\n“No more ‘or what.’ Not tonight.”\nA deep sigh lifted his chest.\n“They’re not out to improve my health,” she said.\n“Nobody said they were.”\n“That comes later, after the Agony.” She knew he hated reminders of that deadly trial but there was no avoiding it. The prospect filled her mind.\n“All right!” He sat up, punched his pillow into shape and leaned back against it to study her. “What’s up?”\n“They’re so damned clever with their word-weapons! She brought Teg to you and said you were fully responsible for him.”\n“You don’t believe it?”\n“He thinks of you as his father.”\n“Not really.”\n“No, but... did you think that about the Bashar?”\n“When he restored my memories? Yeah.”\n“You're a pair of intellectual orphans, always looking for parents who aren’t there. He hasn’t the faintest idea of how much you will hurt him.”\n“That tends to split up the family.”\n“So you hate the Bashar in him and you're glad you'll hurt him.”\n“Didn’t say that.”\n“Why is he so important?”\n“The Bashar? Military genius. Always doing the unexpected. Confounds his foes by appearing where they never expect him to be.”\n“Can't anyone do that?”\n“Not the way he does it. He invents tactics and strategies. Just like that!” Snapping his fingers.\n“More violence. Just like Honored Matres.”\n“Not always. Bashar had a reputation for winning without battle.”\n“I’ve seen the histories.”\n“Don’t trust them.”\n“But you just said...”\n“Histories focus on confrontations. Some truth in that but it hides more persistent things that go on in spite of upheavals.”\n“Persistent things?”\n“What history touches the woman in the rice paddy driving her water buffalo ahead of her plow while her husband is off somewhere, most likely a conscript, carrying a weapon?”\n“Why is that persistent and more important than.. .”\n“Her babies at home need food. Man’s away on this perennial madness? Someone has to do the plowing. She’s a true image of human persistence.”\n“You sound so bitter... I find that odd.”\n“Considering my military history?”\n“That, yes, the Bene Gesserit emphasis on... on their Bashar and elite troops and...”\n“You think they’re just more self-important people going on about their self-important violence? They'll ride right over the woman with her plow?”\n“Why not?”\n“Because very little escapes them. The violent ones ride past the plowing woman and seldom see they have touched basic reality. A Bene Gesserit would never miss such a thing.”\n“Again, why not?”\n“The self-important have limited vision because they ride a death-reality. Woman and plow are life-reality. Without life- reality there’d be no humankind. My Tyrant saw this. The Sisters bless him for it even while they curse him.”\n“So you’re a willing participant in their dream.”\n“I guess | am.” He sounded surprised.\n“And you’re being completely honest with Teg?”\n“He asks, | give him candid answers. | don’t believe in doing violence to curiosity.”\n“And you have full responsibility for him?”\n“That isn’t exactly what she said.”\n“Ahhhhh, my love. Not exact/y what she said. You call Bell hypocrite and don’t include Odrade. Duncan, if you only knew...”\n“As long as we're ignoring the comeyes, spit it out!”\n“Lies, cheating, vicious...”\n“Hey! The Bene Gesserit?”\n“They have that hoary old excuse: Sister A does it so if | do it that’s not so bad. Two crimes cancel each other.”\n“What crimes?”\nShe hesitated. Should I tell him? No. But he expects some answer. “Bell’s delighted the roles are reversed between you and Teg! She’s looking forward to his pain.”\n“Maybe we should disappoint her.” He knew it was a mistake to say this as soon as it was out. 7oo soon.\n“Poetic justice!” Murbella was delighted.\nDivert them! “They aren't interested in justice. Fairness, yes. They have this homily: ‘Those against whom judgment is passed must accept the fairness of it.’”\n“So they condition you to accept their judgment.”\n“There are loopholes in any system.”\n“You know, darling, acolytes learn things.”\n“That’s why they’re acolytes.”\n“I mean we talk to one another.”\n“We? You're an acolyte? You’re a proselyte!”\n“Whatever | am, I’ve heard stories. Your Teg may not be what he seems.”\n“Acolyte gossip.”\n“There are stories out of Gammu, Duncan.”\nHe stared at her. Gammu? He could never think of it by any name other than the original: Giedi Prime. Harkonnen\nhell hole.\nShe took his silence as an invitation to continue. “They say Teg moved faster than the eye could see, that he...”\n"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_cbd4bd6913fffd9f2e8ff8982111d460935912a583a3cec19eda29907aca4ec5_v2"}
