\n　　好在不论怎样选择坝址，看来还不会伤到金家祖坟；如果让那一片死人“搬家”，整个姓金的人家都会出来反对的。但让那几家活人搬家又谈何容易！ \n　　这山嘴上的两大家中，金光亮弟兄三家还好说。他们是地主成份，恐怕不敢胡龊。难说的是金俊武弟兄三家——实际上最难对付的是金俊武一个人！要撬动这个人可不是一件轻而易举的事。 \n　　这样一想，田福堂的情绪有点低落下来；他的宏图大计一开始就遇到了严重的障碍。可他又不甘心放弃这个可以一鸣惊人的壮举…… \n　　在焦虑之中，田福堂想到了他的高参孙玉亭。 \n　　他马上打发放学回家的润生去叫孙玉亭到他家里来。 \n　　玉亭刚到，田福堂就很快把他引到隔壁窑洞去共同谋划这件事。 \n　　孙玉亭听了田福堂的宏伟设想，马上击节叫好，对书记的雄才大略佩服得五体投地；同时意识到在这样一场大战中，他自己也能大显一番身手了。 \n　　紧接着，当书记把此举的困难之处一一给玉亭摆出之后，这位高参倒没把这些问题当个问题。 \n　　他先对自己的统帅说：“革命事业从来不会一帆风顺。我们要与天斗，与地斗，与人斗，才能把农业学大寨搞好。大寨还不是斗出来的吗？” \n　　田福堂说：“这些道理我也懂。毛主席大概说过，具体问题要具体解决。首先这搬家问题就很具体。” \n　　“这问题不难解决。”孙玉亭说，“咱们在金家湾北头给他们几家箍新窑洞不就行了？一孔旧窑洞换一孔新窑洞，他们又不吃亏！” \n　　“人在老地方住惯了，恐怕不情愿倒腾。” \n　　“咦呀！革命还能管他情愿不情愿呢？蒋介石情愿到台湾去吗？” \n　　田福堂笑了，说：“话可以这样说，但这几家人又不是蒋介石。” \n　　“怎？他金光亮弟兄几个都是地主成份，难道他们敢拒挡农业学大寨运动？” \n　　“光亮弟兄几个估计不敢反对，俊武和俊文的工作恐怕就难做了。关键是俊武！只要他同意了，俊文没什么能耐。彩娥是个妇道人家，主不了大事。再说，俊斌就是活着，也是听两个哥哥的话……” \n　　“金俊武他有什么理由反对？他自己是个共产党员，又是大队党支部委员，本来就应该积极支持革命事业！”“你又不是不知道金俊武这个人。”田福堂提醒雄辩的玉亭说。 \n　　“我看他不敢拒挡。破坏农业学大寨这顶帽子他金俊武不敢戴！”孙玉\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
