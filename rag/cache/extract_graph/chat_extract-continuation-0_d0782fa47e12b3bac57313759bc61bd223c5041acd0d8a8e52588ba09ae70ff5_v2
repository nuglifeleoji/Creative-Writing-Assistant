He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they fought well, indeed.”\nThe captured ‘thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\nSo these Fremen can handle ‘thopters, too, Hawat thought.\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once...twice.\n“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. Il’d hoped to have us away without more inconvenience.”\nInconvenience! Hawat thought.\nHe saw two more 'thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue—the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms— remained at the scene of violence.\nAnother ‘thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it—a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load—like a giant bird coming to its nest.\nIn the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving ‘thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.\n“The cowards!” the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.\nThe troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue- clad bodies. Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.\nHawat’s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a ‘thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the Sky. It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving ‘thopter plunged.\nA flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion ‘thopters had been—everything there caught in the flame.\nIt was the Fremen who took off in that captured ‘thopter, Hawat thought. He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are these Fremen?\n“A reasonable exchange,” said the Fremen beside Hawat. “There must’ve been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and\nmake plans to get another aircraft.” He started to step out of their rock-shadowed concealment.\nA rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.\nA thrown knife caught Hawat’s Fremen companion in the throat, hurling him backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.\nMuad’Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad’Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us “The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.” And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning “That path leads ever down into stagnation.”\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mother’s arm, snapped: “Don’t move!”\nThen he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.\n“It’s Idaho,” he breathed.\nThe craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest. Idaho was out of his ‘thopter and running toward them before the dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy-bearded Kynes.\n“This way!” Kynes called and he veered left.\nBehind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.\nIdaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. “M’Lord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we—”\n“What about that back there?”\nPaul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff —the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.\nA rare smile touched Idaho’s round, placid face. “M’Lord...Sire, I’ve left them a little sur—”\nGlaring white light filled the desert—bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had Paul’s arm in one hand, Jessica’s shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated.\nIdaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.\n“Not the family atomics!” Jessica said. “I thought\n”\n“You planted a shield back there,” Paul said.\n“A big one turned to full force,” Idaho said. “A lasgun beam touched it and....” He shrugged.\n“Subatomic fusion,” Jessica said. “That’s a dangerous weapon.”\n“Not weapon, m’Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time.”\nThe Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low voice: “We should get\nunder cover, friends.”\nPaul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.\n“That blast wi// attract considerable attention, Sire,” Idaho said.\nSire, Paul thought.\nThe word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been his father.\nHe felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools.\n“May | take your pack, Sire?” Idaho asked.\n“It’s not heavy, Duncan,” Paul said.\n“You have no body shield,” Idaho said. “Do you wish mine?” He glanced at the distant cliff. “Not likely there'll be any more lasgun activity about.”\n“Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me.”\nJessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.\nThe Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.\n“This way,” one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.\nBehind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner, found another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.\nKynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.\nIn the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping these people? It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done. It could doom me with them.\nThen he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be assumed—the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth—and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.\nJessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way —a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.\n“This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases,” Paul said.\nHis father wanted! Kynes thought.\nAnd again Kynes wondered at himself: Am / foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It'd be so\neasy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with them.\nPaul followed his mother’s example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the bench— dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them. An ozone smell permeated the place.\nSome of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds Started there—machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives.\nPaul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with Small animals in them stacked against the wall.\n“You've recognized this place correctly,” Kynes said. “For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?”\n“To make this planet a fit place for humans,” Paul said.\nPerhaps that’s why I help them, Kynes thought.\nThe machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.\nPaul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.\nA Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: “Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working. | am unable to mask us from proximity detectors.”\n“Can you repair it?” Kynes asked.\n“Not quickly. The parts....” The man shrugged.\n“Yes,” Kynes said. “Then we'll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the Surface.”\n“Immediately.” The man hurried away.\nKynes turned back to Paul. “You gave a good answer.”\nJessica marked the easy rumble of the man’s voice. It was a royal voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.\n“We're most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,” she said.\n“Mm-m-m, we'll see,” Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. “Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.”\n“At once, Liet,” the man said.\nKynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. “If you please?”\nJessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a native group on Arrakis known for their combat skills and ability to survive in the desert\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HAWAT<|>PERSON<|>Hawat is a character involved in the conflict on Arrakis, observing Fremen tactics and Sardaukar forces\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SARDAUKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are elite soldiers of the Padishah Emperor, often disguised in Harkonnen uniforms\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>A desert planet central to the conflict, home to the Fremen and the spice Melange\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MUAD’DIB<|>PERSON<|>A prophetic figure with prescient abilities, later revealed to be Paul Atreides\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCESS IRULAN<|>PERSON<|>A royal figure who authored historical accounts of Muad’Dib and Arrakis\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>PERSON<|>The son of Duke Leto Atreides, who becomes a leader among the Fremen and gains prescient powers\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Paul’s mother and a Bene Gesserit adept, skilled in perception and influence\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A loyal retainer of House Atreides, skilled in combat and strategy\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYNES<|>PERSON<|>The planetologist of Arrakis, also known as Liet among the Fremen, who aids Paul and Jessica\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rival house to the Atreides, responsible for the attack on Arrakis\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPERIAL ECOLOGICAL TESTING STATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facilities used to study and terraform Arrakis\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BATTLE OF ARRAKIS<|>EVENT<|>A conflict involving Fremen, Sardaukar, and House Atreides forces on the desert planet\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HAWAT<|>FREMEN<|>Hawat observes and interacts with the Fremen during the battle<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>SARDAUKAR<|>The Fremen and Sardaukar are engaged in combat<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>MUAD’DIB<|>Paul Atreides is revealed to be Muad’Dib, the prophetic leader<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>JESSICA<|>Paul is Jessica’s son and they are fleeing together<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Duncan Idaho is a loyal protector of Paul<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>FREMEN<|>Kynes is also known as Liet, a leader among the Fremen<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>PAUL ATREIDES<|>Kynes aids Paul and Jessica, seeing potential in Paul’s leadership<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HARKONNEN<|>SARDAUKAR<|>The Harkonnens employ Sardaukar forces in disguise<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPERIAL ECOLOGICAL TESTING STATIONS<|>ARRAKIS<|>The stations are used to study and transform Arrakis<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BATTLE OF ARRAKIS<|>FREMEN<|>The Fremen are key participants in the battle<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BATTLE OF ARRAKIS<|>SARDAUKAR<|>The Sardaukar are involved in the conflict on Arrakis<|>7\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
