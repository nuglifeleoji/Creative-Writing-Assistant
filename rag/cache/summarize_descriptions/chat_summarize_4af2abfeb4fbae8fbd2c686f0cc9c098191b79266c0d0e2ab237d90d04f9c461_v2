As a recurring ghola, Duncan Idaho plays a pivotal role in the project, serving as both a subject of experimentation and a key asset in the Bene Gesserit's broader plans. His repeated resurrection allows the order to analyze his combat skills, loyalty, and genetic traits, making him an invaluable resource in their pursuit of power and knowledge.  \n\nThe Ghola Project itself revolves around the manipulation of genetic memory and the potential for gholas to regain past-life experiences. Duncan Idaho's prominence in this endeavor underscores his unique importance, as his multiple iterations provide critical insights into the limits and possibilities of ghola technology. Whether referred to as part of the \"Bene Gesserit's Ghola Project\" or simply the \"Ghola Project,\" the initiative remains intrinsically tied to Duncan Idaho, whose legacy and recurring presence shape its objectives and outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, Duncan Idaho is the central figure in the Ghola Project, a program led by the Bene Gesserit to explore the capabilities of gholas. His repeated resurrections and the study of his genetic and psychological traits make him indispensable to the project's success.
