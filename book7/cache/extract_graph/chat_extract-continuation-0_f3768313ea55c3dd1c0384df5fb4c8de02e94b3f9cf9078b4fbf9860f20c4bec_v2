“啊？”靖子陷入混乱，这个男人到底在说什么？\n    “总之，”石神用压抑的声音说道：“我现在可以过去一趟吗？”\n    “啊？不，这个……呃，不太方便。”靖子全身冒出冷汗。\n    “花冈小姐，”石神喊她，“光靠女人是无法处理尸体的。”\n    靖子愕然失声，这个男人怎会知道？\n    他听见了，她想。刚才她和美里的争执，隔壁一定都听见了。不，说不定，打从和富坚打斗时就已经听见了。\n    没救了，她认命的想。已经无路可逃了，只能向警方自首：至于美里涉案的事，不管如何都得隐瞒到底。\n    “花冈小姐，你在听吗？”\n    “啊。我在听。”\n    “我可以过去你那边吗？”\n    “啊？可是……”话筒依旧贴在耳上的靖子看着女儿，美里正带着满脸的畏惧与不安。大概是难以理解，母亲到底在和谁谈些什么。\n    倘若石神真的在隔壁竖着耳朵偷听，那他必然也知道美里涉及这起命案。如果他把这件事告诉警方，那么就算靖子再怎么否认，想必刑警也不会相信。\n    靖子下定决心。\n    “我知道了。我也有事想拜托您，那，就请您来一下好吗？”\n    “好，我现在马上过去。”石神说。\n    靖子挂断电话的同时，美里立刻开口问：“谁打来的？”\n    “隔壁的老师。石神先生。”\n        “那个人怎么会……”\n    “这个待会再解释，你先去房间待着，门也要拉上。快点。”\n    美里一脸莫名其妙地走进里屋。几乎就在她拉上纸门的同时，也传来石神走出隔壁房间的动静。\n    门铃终于响起了，靖子走下门口脱鞋处，打开门锁和门链。\n    门一开，只见石神肃然而立。不知为何穿着深蓝色运动服，刚才他并非这般打扮。\n    “请进。”\n    “打扰了。”石神行个礼走进来。\n    靖子锁门的时候他已进了房间，毫不迟疑地掀开暖桌的被子，看他的动作似乎确信那里一定有尸体。\n    他单膝跪地望着富坚的尸体，那副表情似乎在定定思索什么。靖子这才发现，他手上戴着粗线手套。\n    靖子战战兢兢地将目光移向死尸。富坚的脸上已了无生气，嘴唇下方凝结着既非口水又不像呕吐物的干涸痕迹。\n    “请问……果然让您听见了吗？”靖子试问。\n    “听见了？听见什么？”\n    “我是说，我们的对话，所以您才会打电话来吧？”\n    石神听了立刻毫无表情地转向靖子。\n    “不，我完全没听见什么说话的声音。这栋公寓的好处只有隔音效果出乎\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>石神<|>PERSON<|>石神
