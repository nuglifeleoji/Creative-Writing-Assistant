安他妈不计较他。因为她从小把玉亭抚养大，心中对他有一种疼爱的感情。人常说，老嫂为母，这话可一点也不假……“噢——哥！噢——哥！” \n　　玉亭仍然一声接一声地在公路下面喊叫。 \n　　玉厚听见他弟这样喊叫，又不上他家来，不知出了什么事，就一边从院子里往外走，一边给下面的玉亭答应了一声。在院子外的小土坡上往下走的时候，玉厚心里才恍然大悟：他弟弟今晚上不上他家来，是因为他女婿今天被“劳教”了。玉亭现在公社正看得起，让他当了会战指挥部的副总指挥。现在他家里出了“阶级敌人”，玉亭怕人家说他划不清界线，因而连累了他，所以才不上他家里来了。玉厚来到公路上，半天才看清他弟站在路边一棵树影下。他走过去，问：“什么事？” \n　　“唉，也没什么事。想和你拉两句话……你心放宽些！” \n　　玉亭脸上是一副同情他哥的神色。这同情是真诚的，因为这终究是他哥嘛！ \n　　玉厚没有说什么话，沉默地从自己的烟布袋里挖了一锅烟，点着抽起来。 \n　　玉亭也从身上掏出自己的烟锅，在他哥的烟布袋里挖了一锅，又用他哥的火柴点着，说：“满银一脑子的资本主义。劳教两天是小事，再不学习和改正，说不定要进班房。亲戚都要为这小子在政治上受影响……” \n　　玉厚还是一声不吭。他现在已经懒得再说他女婿的长长短短。他心里只是为他的女儿和两个外孙难受。 \n　　“今晚上公社要在学校开批判会，少安没回来，你家里其他人参加不成，你歪好要去一下，不要叫人家说，你们家抵制批判亲属的资本主义倾向……”玉亭对他哥说。“我不去！不劳动不行，不开会还不行！” \n　　“哥，你不敢这样。咱们是贫下中农，毛主席号召的事，咱怎能不积极哩？”玉亭劝他哥说。 \n　　“反正我不参加！我的气已经受够了！哪怕明天让我也劳教哩！” \n　　玉厚说完，气恼地转过身就往回去。他心里烦乱，有什么心思站在公路上讨论这号事情哩！ \n　　玉亭看他哥这样犟，也无可奈何了。要是村里其他人敢这样“反动”，他早就给会战总指挥部汇报了；恐怕今晚上也得上批判台。唉！玉亭心里烦透了，正在他被公社重用的时候，亲属中间突然出现这么一件叫他尴尬的事！ \n　　玉亭失望地见他哥快上了土坡，就又轻轻喊叫了一声：“哥，你先等一等……” \n　　玉厚以为他还要叫他去参加批判会，站住吼叫说：“你走你的！不要管我！” \n　　玉亭走过来说：“……给我抓一把�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>玉亭<|>PERSON<|>玉亭 is a character who has
