generations.” His gaze swept the room. “And we don’t even have a minyan here.”\nRebecca wiped tears from her eyes. “Rabbi, you misjudge the Sisterhood. They wish only to perfect humans and their governments.”\n“So they say.”\n“So /say. Government, to them, is an art form. You find that amusing?”\n“You arouse my curiosity. Are these women self-deluded by dreams of their own importance?”\n“They think of themselves as watchdogs.”\n“Dogs?”\n“Watchdogs, alert to when a lesson may be taught. That is what they seek. Never try to teach someone a lesson he cannot absorb.”\n“Always these bits of wisdom.” He sounded sad. “And they govern themselves artistically?”\n“They think of themselves as a jury with absolute powers that no law can veto.”\nHe waved the scroll in front of her nose. “I thought so!”\n“No human law, Rabbi.”\n“You tell me these women who make religions to suit themselves believe ina... in a power greater than themselves.”\n“Their belief would not accord with ours, Rabbi, but | do not think it evil.”\n“What is this... this belief?”\n“They call it the ‘leveling drift.” They see it genetically and as instinct. Brilliant parents are likely to have children closer to the average, for example.”\n“A drift. This is a belief?”\n“That is why they avoid prominence. They are advisors, even king-makers on occasion, but they do not want to be in the target foreground.”\n“This drift... do they believe there is a Drift-Maker?”\n“They don’t assume there is. Only that there is this observable movement.”\n“So what do they do in this drift?”\n“They take precautions.”\n“In the presence of Satan, | should think so!”\n“They don’t oppose the current but seem only to move across it, making it work for them, using the back eddies.”\n“Oyyy!\"\n“Ancient sailing masters understood this quite well, Rabbi. The Sisterhood has what amounts to current charts telling them places to avoid and where to make their greatest efforts.”\nAgain, he waved the scroll. “This is no current chart.”\n“You misinterpret, Rabbi. They know the fallacies about overwhelming machines.” She glanced at the laboring\nmachinery. “They see us in currents machinery cannot breast.”\n“These little wisdoms. | do not know, daughter. Meddling in politics, | accept. But in holy matters...”\n“A leveling drift, Rabbi. Mass influence on brilliant innovators who move out of the pack and produce new things. Even when the new helps us, the drift catches the innovator.”\n“Who is to say what helps, Rebecca?”\n“I merely tell what they believe. They see taxation as evidence of the drift, taking away free energy that might create more new things. A sensitized person detects it, they Say.”\n“And these . . . these Honored Matres?”\n“They fit the pattern. Power-closed government intent on making all potential challengers ineffectual. Screen out the bright ones. Blunt intelligence.”\nA tiny beeping sound came from the machinery area. Joshua was past them before they could stand. He bent over the screen that revealed events on the surface.\n“They are back,” he said. “See! They dig in the ashes directly above us.”\n“Have they found us?” The Rabbi sounded almost relieved.\nJoshua watched the screen.\nRebecca placed her head beside his, studying the diggers —ten men with that dreaming look in their eyes of those who had been bonded to Honored Matres.\n“They only dig at random,” Rebecca said, straightening.\n“You're sure?” Joshua stood and looked into her face, seeking secret confirmation.\nAny Bene Gesserit could see it.\n“Look for yourself.” She gestured at the screen. “They are leaving. They go to the sligsty now.”\n“Where they belong,” the Rabbi muttered.\nMaking workable choices occurs in a crucible of informative mistakes. Thus Intelligence accepts fallibility. And when absolute (infallible) choices are not known, Intelligence takes chances with limited data in an arena where mistakes are not only possible but also necessary.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nMI other Superior did not just board an outgoing lighter and transfer to any convenient no-ship. There were plans, arrangements, strategies—contingencies on contingencies.\nIt took eight hectic days. Timing with Teg had to be precise. Consultations with Murbella ate up hours. Murbella had to know what she faced.\nDiscover their Achilles’ heel, Murbella, and you have it all. Stay on the observation ship when Teg attacks but watch carefully.\nOdrade took detailed advice from all who could help. Then came the vital-signs implant with encrypting to transmit her secret observations. A no-ship and long-range lighter had to be refitted, crew chosen by Teg.\nBellonda muttered and growled until Odrade intervened.\n“You are distracting me! Is that your intent? Weaken me?” It was late morning four days before departure and they were temporarily alone in the workroom. Weather clear but unseasonably cold and air an ochre tinge from a dust storm that had blown across Central in the night.\n“Convocation was a mistake!” Bellonda needed her parting shot.\nOdrade found herself snapping back at Bellonda, who had become a bit too caustic. “Necessary!”\n“To you, maybe! Saying goodbye to your family. Now, you leave us here taking in each other’s laundry.”\n“Did you just come up here to complain about the Convocation?”\n“I don’t like your latest comments on Honored Matres! You should have consulted us before spreading—”\n“They’re parasites, Bell! It’s time we made that clear: a known weakness. And what does a body do when afflicted by parasites?” Odrade delivered this with a broad grin.\n“Dar, when you assume this. . . this pseudo-humorous pose, | would like to throttle you!”\n“Would you smile as you did it, Bell?”\n“Damn you, Dar! One of these days...”\n“We don’t have many more days together, Bell, and that’s what’s eating you. Answer my question.”\n“Answer it yourself!”\n“The body welcomes periodic delousing. Even addicts dream of freedom.”\n“Ahhhhh.” A Mentat peered from Bellonda’s eyes. “You think addiction to Honored Matres could be made painful?”\n“In spite of your dreadful inability at humor, you still can function.”\nA cruel smile flexed Bellonda’s mouth.\n“I’ve managed to amuse you,” Odrade said.\n“Let me discuss this with Tam. She has a better head for strategy. Although. . . Sharing softened her.”\nWhen Bellonda had gone, Odrade leaned back and laughed quietly. Softened! “Don’t go soft tomorrow, Dar, when you Share.” The Mentat stumbles on logic and misses the heart. She sees the process and worries about failure. What do we do if... We open windows, Bell, and let in common sense. Even hilarity. Puts more serious matters in perspective. Poor Bell, my flawed Sister. Always something to occupy your nervousness.\nOdrade left Central on departure morning much entangled in her thinking—an introspective mood, worried\nby what she had learned Sharing with Murbella and Sheeana.\nI’m being self-indulgent.\nThat offered no relief. Her thoughts were framed by Other Memory and almost cynical fatalism.\nQueen bees swarming?\nThat had been suggested of Honored Matres.\nBut Sheeana? And Tam approves?\nThis carried more in it than a Scattering.\nI cannot follow into your wild place, Sheeana. My task is to produce order. | cannot risk what you have dared. There are different kinds of artistry. Yours repels me.\nAbsorbing lifetimes of Murbella’s Other Memory helped. Murbella’s knowledge was a powerful leverage on Honored Matres but full of disturbing nuances.\nNot hypnotrance. They use cellular induction, a byproduct of their damned T-probes! Unconscious compulsion! How tempting to use it for ourselves. But this is where Honored Matres are most vulnerable—enormous unconsciousness content locked in by their own decisions. Murbella’s key only emphasizes its danger to us.\nThey arrived at the Landing Flat in the midst of a windstorm that buffeted them when they emerged from their car. Odrade had vetoed a walk through what remained of orchards and vineyards.\nLeaving for the last time? The question in Bellonda’s eyes as she said goodbye. In Sheeana’s worried frown.\nDoes Mother Superior accept my decision?\nProvisionally, Sheeana. Provisionally. But | have not warned Murbella. So... perhaps | do share Tam’s judgment.\nDortujla, in the van of Odrade’s party, was withdrawn.\nUnderstandable. She has been there... and watched her Sisters eaten. Courage, Sister! We are not yet defeated.\nOnly Murbella had appeared to take this in stride but she was thinking ahead to Odrade’s encounter with the Spider Queen.\nHave I armed Mother Superior sufficiently? Does she know in her guts how very dangerous this will be?\nOdrade pushed such thoughts aside. There were things to do on the crossing. None of them more important than gathering her energies. Honored Matres could be analyzed almost out of reality, but the actual confrontation would be played as it came—a jazz performance. She liked the idea of jazz although the music distracted her with its antique flavors and the dips into wildness. Jazz spoke about life, though. No two performances ever identical. Players reacted to what was received from the others: jazz.\nFeed us with jazz.\nAir and space travel did not often concern itself with weather. Bludgeon your way through transitory interferences. Depend on Weather Control to provide launch windows through storms and cloud cover. Desert planets were an exception and that would have to be entered into Chapterhouse equations before long. Many changes, including return to Fremen mortuary practices. Bodies rendered for water and potash.\nOdrade spoke of this as they waited for transport up to the ship. That wide cummerbund of hot, dry land expanding around the planet’s equator would begin generating dangerous winds before long. One day, there would be coreolis storms: a blast-furnace from the desert interior with speeds in hundreds of kilometers an hour. Dune had seen winds of more than seven hundred kmh. Even space lighters took notice of such force. Air travel would be subject to the constant whims of surface conditions. And frail human flesh must find whatever shelter it could.\nAs we always have.\nThe lounge at the Flat was old. Stone inside and out, their first major building material here. Spartan slingchairs and low tables of molded plaz were more recent. Economy could not be ignored even for Mother Superior.\nThe lighter arrived in a dusty maelstrom. No nonsense about suspensor cushioning. This would be a quick lift with uncomfortable gees but not high enough to damage flesh.\nOdrade felt almost disembodied as she said her final farewells and turned Chapterhouse over to a triumvirate of Sheeana, Murbella, and Bellonda. One last word: “Don’t interfere with Teg. And | don’t want anything nasty happening to Duncan. Hear me", " kilometers an hour. Dune had seen winds of more than seven hundred kmh. Even space lighters took notice of such force. Air travel would be subject to the constant whims of surface conditions.

One last word: “Don’t interfere with Teg. And | don’t want anything nasty happening to Duncan. Hear me, Bell?”\nAll of the wonderful technological things they could accomplish and they still could not keep a thick sandstorm from almost blinding them as they lifted. Odrade closed her eyes and accepted the fact that she was not to get a last low-level overview of her beloved planet. She awoke to the thump of docking. Buzzcar waiting in a corridor just beyond the lock. Ahumming traverse to their quarters. Tamalane, Dortujla, and the acolyte servant maintained silence, respecting Mother Superior’s desire to be with her own thoughts.\nThe quarters, at least, were familiar, standard on Bene Gesserit ships: a small sitting-dining room in elemental plaz of uniform light green; smaller sleeping chamber with walls in the same color and a single hard cot. They knew Mother Superior’s preferences. Odrade glanced into a usiform bath and toilet. Standard facilities. Adjoining quarters for Tam and Dortujla were similar. Time later to look at the ship’s refittings.\nAll essentials had been provided. Including unobtrusive elements of psychological support: subdued colors, familiar furnishings, a setting to disturb none of her mental processes. She gave orders for departure before returning to her sitting-dining room.\nFood was waiting on a low table—blue fruit, sweet and plummy, a savory yellow spread on bread tailored to her energy needs. Very good. She watched the assigned acolyte at her self-effacing work arranging Mother Superior’s effects. The name evaded Odrade for a second, then: Su/pol.\nA dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient.\nIt struck Odrade suddenly that these assignments had an element of callousness in them. A small entourage, not to offend Honored Matres. And keep our losses to a minimum.\n“Have you unpacked all of my things, Suipol?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior.” Very proud of having been chosen for this important assignment. It showed in her walk as she left.\nThere are some things you cannot unpack for me, Suipol. | carry those in my head.\nNo Bene Gesserit from Chapterhouse ever left the planet without taking along a certain amount of chauvinism. Other places were never quite as beautiful, never quite as serene, never as pleasant a habitat.\nBut this is the Chapterhouse that was.\nIt was an aspect of the desert transformation she had never before viewed in quite that way. Chapterhouse was removing itself. Going away, never to return, at least not in the lifetimes of those who knew it now. It was like being abandoned by a beloved parent—disdainfully and with malice.\nYou are no longer important to me, child.\nOn the way to becoming a Reverend Mother, they were taught early that travel could provide a peaceful byway for rest. Odrade fully intended to take advantage of this and told her companions immediately after eating, “Spare me details.”\nSuipol was sent to summon Tamalane. Odrade spoke in Tam’s own terse meter. “Inspect the refitting and tell me what I should see. Take Dortujla.”\n“Good head, that one.” High praise from Tam.\n“When we're through, isolate me as much as possible.”\nDuring part of the crossing, Odrade strapped herself into the webbing of her cot and occupied herself composing what she thought of as a last will and testament.\nWho would be executor?\nMurbella was her personal choice, especially after the Sharing with Sheeana. Still... the Dune waif remained a potent candidate if this venture to Junction failed.\nSome assumed any Reverend Mother could serve if responsibility fell on her. But not in these times. Not with this trap set. Honored Matres were unlikely to avoid the pitfall.\nIf we've judged them correctly. And Murbella’s data says we’ve done our best. The opening is there for Honored Matres to enter, and oh, how inviting it will appear. They won't see the dead end until they're well into it. Too late!\nBut what if we fail?\nSurvivors (if any) would hold Odrade in contempt.\n| have often felt diminished but never an object of contempt. Yet the decisions | made may never be accepted by my Sisters. At least, |! make no excuses... not even to the ones with whom I Shared. They know my response comes from the darkness before a human dawn. Any of us may do a futile thing, even a stupid thing. But my plan can give us victory. We will not “just survive.” Our grail requires us to persist together. Humans need us! Sometimes, they need religions. Sometimes, they need merely know their beliefs are as empty as their hopes for nobility. We are their source. After the masks are removed, that remains: Our Niche.\nShe felt then that this ship was taking her into the pit. Closer and closer to awful threat.\n| go to the axe; it does not come to me.\nNo thoughts of exterminating this foe. Not since the Scattering magnified human population had that been possible. A flaw in Honored Matre schemes.\nThe high-pitched beep and flashing orange light that signaled arrival brought her out of repose. She struggled from her sling straps and, with Tam, Dortujla, and Suipol close behind, followed a guide to the transport lock where a\nlongrange lighter clung to its shiptit. Odrade looked at the lighter visible in bulkhead scanners. Incredibly small!\n“It’ll only be nineteen hours,” Duncan had said. “But that’s as close as we dare bring the no-ship. They’re sure to have foldspace sensors close around Junction.”\nBell, for once, had agreed. Don’t risk the ship. It’s there to plot outer defenses and receive your transmissions, not just to deliver Mother Superior. The lighter was the no-ship’s forward sensor, signaling what it encountered.\nAnd I am the foremost sensor, a fragile body with delicate instruments.\nThere were guide arrows at the lock. Odrade led the way. They went through a small tube in free-fall. She found herself in a surprisingly rich cabin. Suipol, tumbling behind, recognized it and went up a notch in Odrade’s estimation.\n“This was a smuggler ship.”\nOne person awaited them. Male by his smell but an opaque pilot’s hood bristling with connectors concealed his face.\n“Everyone strap in.”\nMale voice within that instrumentation.\nTeg chose him. He'll be the best.\nOdrade slipped into a seat behind a landing port and found the lumpy protrusions that unreeled into web harness. She heard the others obeying the pilot’s command.\n“All secure? Stay strapped in unless | say otherwise.” His voice came from a floating speaker behind his seat at the drive console.\nThe umbilicus went “Bap!” Odrade felt gentle motions, but the view in the relay beside her showed the no-ship receding at a remarkable rate. It winked out of existence.\nGoing about its business before anyone can come out to investigate.\nThe lighter had surprising speed. Scanners reported planetary stations and transition barriers at eighteen-plus hours but winking dots identifying them were visible only\nbecause they had been enhanced. A window in the scanner said the stations would be naked-eye visible in a little more than twelve of those hours.\nThe sense of motion ceased abruptly and Odrade no longer felt the acceleration her eyes reported. Suspensor cabin. Ixian technology for a nullfield this small. Where had Teg acquired it?\nNot necessary for me to know. Why tell Mother Superior where every oak plantation is located?\nShe watched sensor contacts begin within the hour and gave silent thanks for Idaho’s astuteness.\nWe're beginning to know these Honored Matres. Junction’s defensive pattern was apparent even without scanner analysis. Overlapping planes! Just as Teg predicted. With knowledge of how barriers were spaced, Teg’s people\ncould weave another globe around the planet.\nSurely it’s not that simple.\nWere Honored Matres so confident of overwhelming power that they ignored elementary precautions?\nPlanetary Station Four began calling when they were just under three hours out. “Identify yourself!”\nOdrade heard an “or else” in that command.\nThe pilot’s response obviously surprised the watchers. “You come in a little smuggler ship?”\nSo they recognize it. Teg is right once more.\n“I’m about to burn the sensor equipment in the drive,” the pilot announced. “It will add to our thrust. Make sure you're all securely harnessed.”\nStation Four noticed. “Why are you increasing velocity?”\nOdrade leaned forward. “Repeat the countersign and say our party is fatigued from too long in cramped quarters. Add that | have equipped myself with a precautionary vital-signs transmitter to alert my people should | die.”\nThey won't find the encryption! Clever Duncan. And wasn’t Bell surprised to discover what he hid in Shipsystems. “More romantics!”\nThe pilot relayed her words. Back came the order: “Reduce velocity and lock onto those coordinates for landing. We are taking over your ship control at this point.”\nThe pilot touched a yellow field on his board. “Just the way the Bashar said they would.” A gloating sound in his voice. He lifted the hood off his head and turned.\nOdrade was shocked.\nCyborg!\nThe face was a metal mask with two glittering silver balls for eyes.\nWe enter dangerous ground.\n“They didn’t tell you?” he asked. “Waste no pity. | was dead and this gave me life. It’s Clairby, Mother Superior. And when | die this time, that will buy me life as a ghola.”\nDamn! We're trading in coin that may be denied us. Too late to change. And that was Teg’s plan. But... Clairby?\nThe lighter landed with a smoothness that spoke of superb control by Station Four. Odrade knew the moment because a manicured landscape visible in her scanner no longer moved. The nullfield was turned off and she felt gravity. The hatch directly in front of her opened. Temperature pleasantly warm. Noise out there. Children playing some competitive game?\nLuggage floating behind, she stepped onto a short flight of steps and saw that the noise did indeed come from a large group of children in a nearby field. In their high teens and female. They were butting a suspensor float-ball back and forth, shouting and screaming as they played.\nStaged for our benefit?\nOdrade thought it likely. There probably were two thousand young women on that field.\nLook how many recruits we have coming along!\nNo one to greet her but Odrade saw a familiar structure down a paved lane to her left. Obvious Spacing Guild artifact with a recent tower added. She spoke of the tower as she glanced around her, giving the implaned transmitter\ndata on a change from Teg’s groundplan.
