个人心里都明白这是永别了。\n　　增援未来的政工特遣队将前往冬眠地，常伟思同太空军的几名高级将领一起到机场送行，他把一封信交给章北海。\n　　“这是给我未来继任者的信，我在信中介绍了你们的情况，并向未来的太空军司令部做出郑重推荐。你们苏醒的时间最早是五十年后，还可能更长，那时你们可能面临更加严峻的工作环境，首先要适应未来，同时要保持我们这个时代军人的灵魂，要弄明白我们现在的和作方法，哪些是过时的，哪些是需要坚持的，这都有可能成为你们在未来的巨大优势。”\n　　章北海说：“首长，我第一次为无神论者感到一些遗憾，否则我们就可以怀着希望在某个时间某个地方晟后相聚。”\n　　一贯冷峻的他说出这样的话，让常伟思有些意外，这话也在所有人的心中再次掀起了波澜，但作为军人，他们都把内心的悸动深深隐藏起来。\n　　“此生能相聚已经很幸运了，代我们向未来的同志问好吧。”常伟思说。\n　　敬过最后的军礼，特遣队开始登机。\n　　常伟思的目光一直没有离开章北海的背影，这个坚定的战士走了，可能不会再有第二个他这样的人。他那种坚定的信念是从哪里来的？这个问题一直藏在常伟思心底，有时想到这个甚至令他有些嫉妒。一个拥有胜利信念的军人是幸运的，在这场终极战争中，能有这种幸运的人少之又少。章北海挺拔的身影消失在舱门中，常伟思不得不承认，到最后，自己也没能彻底了解他。\n　　飞机起飞了，载着这些有机会看到人类最后结局的人，消失在苍白的薄云后面。这是一个萧瑟的冬日，太阳在这层灰纱般的薄云后面发出无力的白光，寒风吹过空荡荡的机场，寒冷使空气像一块凝固的水晶，此景使人怀疑春天真的还会到来。常伟思拉紧了军大衣的领口，今天是他五十四岁生日，在这凄凉的冬风中，他同时看到了自己和人类的尽头。危机纪年第20 年，三体舰队距太阳系4.15 光年雷迪亚兹和希恩斯被同时从冬眠中唤醒，他们被告知，等待的技术已经出现了。\n　　“这么快？”当两人得知时间仅仅过去了八年时，都发出了这样的感叹。\n　　他们接着被告知，由于前所未有的大量投入，这几年的技术进步确实神速，但这没有什么值得乐观的，人类不过是在他们和智子障碍之间的最后距离上加速冲刺而已。进步的只是技术，前沿物理学如一池死水般停滞不前。理论的储备正在被消耗完，人类的技术进步将出现减速，直至完全停止，但目前人们仍不清楚技术的尽头将在何时出现。\n　　希恩斯拖着冬眠后仍然僵硬的脚步，走进了一个外形像体育馆的建筑物。\n######################\nOutput:",
