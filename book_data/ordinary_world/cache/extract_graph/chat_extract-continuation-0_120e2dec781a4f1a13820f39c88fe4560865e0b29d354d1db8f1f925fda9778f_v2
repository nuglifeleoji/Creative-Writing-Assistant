苦……这是不言而喻的。这双重的打击，就是搁在饱经世故的成年人身上，也够沉重的了，何况他才十九岁——严格说来，还是一个孩子哩。 \n　　他原来就为多说话，现在完全沉默了，像个哑巴，一声不吭地跟着父亲和哥哥，开始了艰辛的劳动生涯。好在村里已经包产到户，大家不在一块干活了，他的不快了只有家里人才知道。他尽量躲避着外人。 \n　　黑夜，他大睁着眼睛睡不着觉。于是就披上冬天才穿的棉袄，偷偷从家里溜出来，独自一个人在村前的河湾里漫无目的地走动，活像一个夜游神，小丽的影子无时无刻不在纠缠他。他想恨，但又恨不起来，因为过去那些无限美妙的感情仍然在他心头温柔地盘缠着，一丝儿也剪不断。 \n　　但是，更痛苦的是，他觉得他愧对了一个好时代。眼下国家正需要有知识的人才，而他又多想为祖国做一番大事业呀！四个现代化对有些人来说，只不过是个口号罢了，但对他这样的热血青年来说，却是一件实实在在的事。他知道，未来一个极其重要的时期，需要他们这一代人充当祖国的脊梁，可是他却在这个时候遭受了不幸！ \n　　“我太痛苦了……”他想。 \n　　“但是”，他又想，“难道我就这样甘愿让痛苦的火焰把自己给毁了？不该啊！正因为我如此痛苦，我才要争一口气！不仅要好好劳动，还应该好好学习！小丽，我总有一天还要此见到你，你等着看吧，当我再见到你的时候……”他这样想着，牙齿便在嘴里咬得格崩崩价响，两只物也不由得握成了两只拳头。年轻人的血液又在他周身沸沸扬扬，一种新的意识终于在他的头脑中苏醒了。 \n　　他仍然沉默寡言，拚命劳动。 \n　　不久，高仁山老汉发现在他们出山干活的路上，到处栽着一些小石片，上面用白粉笔写着一些“洋字码”。老汉认出这不是中国字，而又写在这山野里，弄得心惊肉跳，以为是出了外国特务，他把这件神氦的事告诉了老婆却不以为然地对他说：“你没看咱们茅而里的石头上也写着？”大儿子忍不住笑了，对父亲说：“你真可笑！外国特务路到咱这里干啥呀？‘特务’就在咱家里。那是大年写的英语单词。” \n　　“那是怎啦？”父亲问大儿子。 \n　　“怎啦，他还想考大学！” \n　　老两口惊讶地张开了嘴巴，仁山老汉摇摇他那已经苍白了的头，说：“还是好好劳动吧，咱先人的坟墓没得着好风水！” \n　　不管怎样，大年重新奋发起来。他首先从他考得最糟的英语开始复习。他不愿意呆在家里埋头学习\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
