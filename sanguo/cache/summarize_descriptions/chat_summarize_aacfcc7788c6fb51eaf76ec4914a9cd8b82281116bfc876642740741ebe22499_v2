He served the Shu Han kingdom and is notably recognized as the elder brother of the renowned strategist Zhuge Liang (诸葛亮). Throughout his career, Zhuge Jin was involved in various diplomatic missions and military campaigns, showcasing his multifaceted talents and deep understanding of political dynamics.\n\nAs a diplomat, Zhuge Jin was sent to negotiate peace with Sun Quan (孙权) on behalf of Liu Bei (刘备), reflecting his significant role in the intricate relationships between the kingdoms of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. His diplomatic efforts were not limited to peace negotiations; he also acted as an envoy from Wu, tasked with persuading Guan Yu (关羽) to align with Eastern Wu, demonstrating his influence and the trust placed in him by his leaders.\n\nIn addition to his diplomatic endeavors, Zhuge Jin was a military leader who coordinated external attacks, notably against Cao Zhen (曹真) during the siege of Nan Jun (南郡). Despite his military capabilities, he faced challenges on the battlefield, including defeats that prompted him to seek communication with Lu Xun (陆逊) regarding the evolving military situation. His ability to adapt and seek counsel during difficult times highlights his strategic mindset.\n\nZhuge Jin was also known for his wisdom and scholarly nature. He advised Sun Quan against forming an alliance with Yuan Shao (袁绍), showcasing his foresight in political alliances and the potential consequences of such decisions. His insights were valued by key figures in Eastern Wu, including Zhou Yu (周瑜), who hoped that Zhuge Jin could persuade his brother, Zhuge Liang, to support the Eastern Wu cause.\n\nThroughout his life, Zhuge Jin remained a representative of Shu Han, advocating for peace and strategic alliances rather than unnecessary conflict. He attempted to dissuade Guan Yu from being overly fixated on warfare with their enemies, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy and unity in the face of adversity.\n\nIn summary, Zhuge Jin was a distinguished diplomat and military leader whose contributions to the Shu Han kingdom and his interactions with Eastern Wu were pivotal during a tumultuous period in Chinese history.
