She holds a leadership role as their Commander, though her authority is currently limited in scope. Her position ties her directly to Leto’s military structure, reflecting her importance in his broader plans.  \n\nSiona’s connection to the Fish Speakers runs deep—she was educated in their schools, which honed her skills and political awareness, shaping her into a capable leader. Despite her distinct role, she is often mistaken for a Fish Speaker, underscoring their pervasive influence and her integration into their ranks. The Fish Speakers have also informed her about Leto’s breeding program and her own origins, further binding her to their organization.  \n\nWhile she commands the Fish Speakers, her relationship with them extends beyond mere authority. She is escorted by them to the Citadel and remains part of their broader community, suggesting both mutual respect and interdependence. Her oath to lead them solidifies her place within Leto’s regime, even as her unique role sets her apart.  \n\nIn summary, Siona is both a product and a leader of the Fish Speakers, deeply embedded in their structure while fulfilling a specialized function in Leto’s designs.
