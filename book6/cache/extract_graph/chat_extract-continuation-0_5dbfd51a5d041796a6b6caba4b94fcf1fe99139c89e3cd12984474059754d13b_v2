空无一人，看上去是客机的样子，有四排空空的座椅。但当进入中舱后，罗辑看到这里有一间相当宽敞的办公室，还有一个套间，透过半开的门，罗辑看到那是一间卧室。这里的陈设都很普通，干净整洁，如果不是看到沙发和椅子上的绿色安全带，感觉不到是在飞机上。罗辑知道，像这样的专机，国内可能没有几架。\n　　带他们进来的三人中，两人径直穿过另一个门向尾舱去了，留下的最年轻的那位说：“请你们随便坐，但一定要系好安全带，千万要注意，不只是在起飞降落时，全程都要系安全带，睡觉时也要把床上的安全睡袋扣好；不要在外面放不固定的小物品；尽量不要离开座位或床，如果需要起来活动，请一定先通知机长。\n　　这样的按钮就是送话器开关，座位和床边都有，按下后就能通话。有什么其他需要，也可以通过它呼叫我们。“\n　　罗辑疑惑地看看史强，后者解释说：“这飞机有可能做特技飞行。”\n　　那人点点头，“是的，有事请叫我，叫小张就行，起飞后我会给你们送晚饭的。”\n　　小张走后，罗辑和史强坐到沙发上，各自系好安全带。罗辑四下看看，除了窗子是圆的，有窗的那面墙有些弧度外，一切都是那么普通和熟悉，以至于他们俩系着安全带坐在这问普通办公室里感觉怪怪的。但很快引擎的轰鸣和微微的震动提醒他们是在一架飞机上，飞机正在向起飞跑道滑行，几分钟后，随着引擎声音的变化，超重使两人陷进沙发中。来自地面的震动消失后，办公室的地板在他们面前倾斜了。随着飞机的上升，在地面已经落下去的夕阳又把一束光从舷窗投进来，就在十分钟前，同一个太阳也把今天的最后一束夕照投进章北海父亲的病房中。\n　　当罗辑所乘的飞机飞越海岸时，在他一万米的下方，吴岳和章北海再次注视着建造中的“唐”号。在以前和以后所有的时间里，这是罗辑距这两位军人最近的一次。\n　　像上次一样，“唐”号巨大的船体笼罩在刚刚降临的暮色中，船壳中国科上的焊花似乎不像上次那么密了，照在上面的灯光也暗了许多。而这时，吴岳和章北海已经不属于海军了。\n　　“听说，总装备部已经决定停止‘唐’号工程了。”章北海说。\n　　“这与我们还有关系吗？”吴岳冷漠地回答，目光从“唐”号上移开，遥望着西天残存的那一抹晚霞。\n　　“自从进入太空军后，你的情绪一直很低落。”\n　　“你应该知道原因吧，你总是能轻易看到我的思想，有时候看得比我还透彻，经你提醒，我才知道自己真正想的是什么。”\n　　章北海转身直视着吴岳：“对于投身于一场注定要失败的战争，\n######################\nOutput:",
