Already, | feel myself being tied to bits of you. Ah-h-h, you’ve a mind filled with interesting things. So many things I’d never imagined.”\nAnd the memory-mind encapsulated within her opened itself to Jessica, permitting a view down a wide corridor to other Reverend Mothers until there seemed no end to them.\nJessica recoiled, fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness. Still, the corridor remained, revealing to Jessica that the Fremen culture was far older than she had suspected.\nThere had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an easy planet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on Bela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus.\nOh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting.\nFar down the corridor, an image-voice screamed: “They denied us the Hajj!”\nJessica saw the slave cribs on Bela Tegeuse down that inner corridor, saw the weeding out and the selecting that soread men to Rossak and\nHarmonthep. Scenes of brutal ferocity opened to her like the petals of a terrible flower. And she saw the thread of the past carried by Sayyadina after Sayyadina—first by word of mouth, hidden in the sand chanteys, then refined through their own Reverend Mothers with the discovery of the poison drug on Rossak...and now developed to subtle strength on Arrakis in the discovery of the Water of Life.\nFar down the inner corridor, another voice screamed: “Never to forgive! Never to forget!”\nBut Jessica’s attention was focused on the revelation of the Water of Life, seeing its source: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm, a maker. And as she saw the killing of itin her new memory, she Suppressed a gasp.\nThe creature was drowned!\n“Mother, are you all right?”\nPaul’s voice intruded on her, and Jessica struggled out of the inner awareness to stare up at him, conscious of duty to him, but resenting his presence.\nl'm like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the first moment of awareness—until one day the ability to feel is forced into them.\nThe thought hung in her mind, an enclosing awareness.\nAnd I say: “Look! | have no hands!” But the people all around me say: “What are hands?”\n“Are you all right?” Paul repeated.\n“Yes,”\n“Is this all right for me to drink?” He gestured to the sack in Chani’s hands. “They want me to drink it.”\nShe heard the hidden meaning in his words, realized he had detected the poison in the original, unchanged substance, that he was concerned for her. It occurred to Jessica then to wonder about the limits of Paul’s prescience. His question revealed much to her.\n“You may drink it,” she said. “It has been changed.” And she looked beyond him to see Stilgar staring down at her, the dark-dark eyes studying.\n“Now, we know you cannot be false,” he said.\nShe sensed hidden meaning here, too, but the muzziness of the drug was overpowering her senses. How warm it was and soothing. How beneficent these Fremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship.\nPaul saw the drug take hold of his mother.\nHe searched his memory—the fixed past, the flux- lines of the possible futures. It was like scanning through arrested instants of time, disconcerting to the lens of the inner eye. The fragments were difficult to understand when snatched out of the flux.\nThis drug—he could assemble knowledge about it, understand what it was doing to his mother, but the knowledge lacked a natural rhythm, lacked a system of mutual reflection.\nHe realized suddenly that it was one thing to see the past occupying the present, but the true test of prescience was to see the past in the future.\nThings persisted in not being what they seemed.\n“Drink it,” Chani said. She waved the hornspout of a watersack under his nose.\nPaul straightened, staring at Chani. He felt carnival excitement in the air. He knew what would happen if he drank this spice drug with its quintessence of the substance that brought the change onto him. He would return to the vision of pure time, of time- become-space. It would perch him on the dizzying summit and defy him to understand.\nFrom behind Chani, Stilgar said: “Drink it, lad. You delay the rite.”\nPaul listened to the crowd then, hearing the wildness in their voices—“Lisan al-Gaib,” they said. “Muad’Dib!” He looked down at his mother. She appeared peacefully asleep in a sitting position—her breathing even and deep. A phrase out of the future that was his lonely past came into his mind: “She sleeps in the Waters of Life.”\nChani tugged at his sleeve.\nPaul took the hornspout into his mouth, hearing the people shout. He felt the liquid gush into his throat as Chani pressed the sack, sensed giddiness in the fumes. Chani removed the spout, handed the sack into hands that reached for it from the floor of the cavern. His eyes focused on her arm, the green band of mourning there.\nAs she straightened, Chani saw the direction of his gaze, said: “I can mourn him even in the happiness of the waters. This was something he gave us.” She put her hand into his, pulling him along the ledge. “We are alike in a thing, Usul: We have each lost a father to the Harkonnens.”\nPaul followed her. He felt that his head had been separated from his body and restored with odd connections. His legs were remote and rubbery.\nThey entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by spaced-out glowglobes. Paul felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him, opening time like a flower. He found need to steady himself against Chani as they turned through another Shadowed tunnel. The mixture of whipcord and softness he felt beneath her robe stirred his blood. The sensation mingled with the work of the drug, folding future and past into the present, leaving him the thinnest margin of trinocular focus.\n“I know you, Chani,” he whispered. “We've sat upon a ledge above the sand while | soothed your fears. We’ve caressed in the dark of the sietch. We've....” He found himself losing focus, tried to Shake his head, stumbled.\nChani steadied him, led him through thick hangings into the yellow warmth of a private apartment—low tables, cushions, a sleeping pad beneath an orange spread.\nPaul grew aware that they had stopped, that Chani stood facing him, and that her eyes betrayed a look of quiet terror.\n“You must tell me,” she whispered.\n“You are Sihaya,” he said, “the desert spring.”\n“When the tribe shares the Water,” she said, “we're together—all of us. We...share. | can...sense the others with me, but I’m afraid to share with you.”\n“Why?”\nHe tried to focus on her, but past and future were merging into the present, blurring her image. He saw her in countless ways and positions and settings.\n“There’s something frightening in you,” she said. “When I took you away from the others...| did it because | could feel what the others wanted. You... press on people. You...make us see things!”\nHe forced himself to speak distinctly: “What do you see?”\nShe looked down at her hands. “I see a child...in my arms. It’s our child, yours and mine.” She put a hand to her mouth. “How can | know every feature of you?”\nThey’ve a little of the talent, his mind told him. But they suppress it because it terrifies.\nIn a moment of clarity, he saw how Chani was trembling.\n“What is it you want to say?” he asked.\n“Usul,” she whispered, and still she trembled.\n“You cannot back into the future,” he said.\nA profound compassion for her swept through him. He pulled her against him, stroked her head. “Chani, Chani, don’t fear.”\n“Usul, help me,” she cried.\nAs she spoke, he felt the drug complete its work within him, ripping away the curtains to let him see the distant gray turmoil of his future.\n“You're so quiet,” Chani said.\nHe held himself poised in the awareness, seeing time stretch out in its weird dimension, delicately balanced yet whirling, narrow yet spread like a net gathering countless worlds and forces, a tightwire\nthat he must walk, yet a teeter-totter on which he balanced.\nOn one side he could see the Imperium, a Harkonnen called Feyd-Rautha who flashed toward him like a deadly blade, the Sardaukar raging off their planet to spread pogrom on Arrakis, the Guild conniving and plotting, the Bene Gesserit with their scheme of selective breeding. They lay massed like a thunderhead on his horizon, held back by no more than the Fremen and their Muad’Dib, the sleeping giant Fremen poised for their wild crusade across the universe.\nPaul felt himself at the center, at the pivot where the whole structure turned, walking a thin wire of peace with a measure of happiness, Chani at his side. He could see it stretching ahead of him, a time of relative quiet in a hidden sietch, a moment of peace between periods of violence.\n“There’s no other place for peace,” he said.\n“Usul, you’re crying,” Chani murmured. “Usul, my strength, do you give moisture to the dead? To whose dead?”\n“To ones not yet dead,” he said.\n“Then let them have their time of life,” she said.\nHe sensed through the drug fog how right she was, pulled her against him with savage pressure. “Sihaya!” he said.\nShe put a palm against his cheek. “I’m no longer afraid, Usul. Look at me. | see what you see when you hold me thus.”\n“What do you see?” he demanded.\n“| see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It’s what we were meant to do.”\nThe drug had him again and he thought: So many times you’ve given me comfort and forgetfulness. He felt anew the hyperillumination with its high-relief imagery of time, sensed his future becoming memories—the tender indignities of physical love, the sharing and communion of selves, the softness and the violence.\n“You're the strong one, Chani,” he muttered. “Stay with me.”\n“Always,” she said, and kissed his cheek.\nBOOK THREE THE PROPHET\nNo woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father. The closest anyone ever came to casual cameraderie with the Padishah Emperor was the relationship offered by Count Hasimir Fenring, a companion from childhood. The measure of Count Fenring’s friendship may be seen first in a positive thing: he allayed the Landsraad’s suspicions after the Arrakis Affair. It cost more than a billion solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were other gifts as well: slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank. The second major evidence of the Count’s friendship was negative. He refused to kill a man even though it was within his capabilities and my father commanded it. | will relate this presently.\n—FROM “COUNT FENRING: A PROFILE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen raged down the corridor from his private apartments, flitting through patches of late afternoon sunlight that poured down from high windows.
