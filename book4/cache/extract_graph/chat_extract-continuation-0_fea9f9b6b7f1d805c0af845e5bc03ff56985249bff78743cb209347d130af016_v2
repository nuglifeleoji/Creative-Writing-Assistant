�走；呻吟般的“嗯哟”声象来自大地深处……在这令人痛苦的呻吟中，那只下行的船已经漂到了一片平静的水面上；接着便传来了艄公那无拘无束的歌声—— \n　　你晓得， \n　　天下黄河几十几道湾？ \n　　几十几道湾里几十几条船？ \n　　几十几条船上几十几根杆？ \n　　几十几个艄工来把船扳？ \n　　船工们的应合声如同闷雷一般——我晓得， \n　　天下黄河九十九道湾，九十九道湾里九十九条船，九十九条船上九十九根杆，九十九个艄工来把船扳！ \n　　船和歌声都渐渐远去了……孙少安立在大桥边上，两只手紧紧抠着桥栏杆，十个指头似乎都要钳进水泥柱中，他感到胸腔里火烧火燎，口也有点干渴。他的心中腾跃起一股难以抑制的激情，似乎那奔涌不息的河水已经流进了他的血管！ \n　　他离开桥边，走过去解开牲口的缰绳，一翻身骑上去，风一般迅疾地穿过大桥，向黄河西岸奔去…… \n                  第8章\n　　九月下旬，在一个秋雨蒙蒙的日子里，孙少安带着自己的畜力车，来到了原西县城。 \n　　雨中的原西城非常寂静。雨水洗过的青石板街上，看起来没有多少行人，商店的门都开着，但顾客寥寥无几；售货员坐在柜台后面，寂寞地打着深长的哈欠。街道两边一些低矮的老式房顶上，水迹明光，立着一行行翠绿的瓦葱。到处都能听见淙淙的流水声。空气中满含着土腥味。原西河涨宽了，城内也能听见远处河水有力的喧哗声。天空灰暗的云朵一直低垂下来，和城外山顶上蓝色的雾气溶接在一起，缓慢上升着向北方涌动，偶尔传来一声公鸡的啼鸣和几声狗的吠叫，那声音听起来是湿漉漉的……一年一度的秋雨季节开始了。在农村，庄稼人现在都一头倒在热炕上，拉着沉重的鼾声，没明没黑，除过吃饭就是睡觉似乎要把一年里积攒下来的疲乏，都在这雨天舒散出去。多么好啊！朦胧的睡梦中闻着小米南瓜饭的香甜味，听着自己的老婆在锅灶上把盆盆罐罐碰得叮当响……但是，孙少安享不成这福了。他现在浑身攒着劲，准备要在县城大动干戈。这是他的一次命运之战。 \n　　找到根民的表兄后，他才得知，由于等不到根民的回话，他表兄前不久已把这活包给了别人。听说他要来，根民的表兄费了好大劲才又把原来包活的人辞退了。 \n　　孙少安倒抽了一口冷�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YELLOW
