，香烟飘绕，如同仙境一般。此寺相传建于唐。据现有清嘉庆八年碑志记载，系肇自金统四年，即公元一一四四年，迄今已有八百多年的历史。历经各代兵匪战乱之后，从外观看，这座著名的古迹只留下了一片瓦砾和枯草中立着的一座石牌坊——“文化革命”初期，这座石牌坊也被破“四旧”的红卫兵推倒了。不过，这里还留有一个千佛洞。基本上保持完好。 \n　　走过一片瓦砾草滩，来到石崖下，就被石洞门口一副石刻大幅对联吸引住了：石山石洞石佛像天下第一，泓寺泓庙泓佛堂世界无二。石洞高三十多米、宽六十多米；洞顶齐平，雕刻有各种图案、书法。洞中央坐着一个特大的石佛像；左右站着两个。洞两边有两道走廊，走廊上又分别立十八个大石佛像。气派之大甚至可以和杭州灵隐寺“大雄宝殿”里泥塑大佛像比美。另外，洞内周围三十多米高的石墙壁上，雕刻着一排排不同姿态，涂着各种颜色的密密麻麻的小佛像，简直难以数清。遗憾的是，有些石碑和佛像已经残缺不全了。 \n　　田福军和张有智从洞中转出来，走到瓦砾场被推倒的石牌坊前面，共同坐在一根锈着绿斑的石柱上。陪他们转游的田福军的秘书白元，也坐在他们对面，胳膊上小心翼翼地挽着地委书记的外套。 \n　　苗凯调走以后，白元就又当了田福军的秘书。一般情况下，新任领导都不用前任的秘书。田福军不“忌讳”这个常规，仍然让白元当他的秘书。白元因为在前任书记面前迫不及待要了一回官，反而什么官也没当成。但这位秘书在心里还是敬畏他的前任领导，而对田福军有点瞧不起（当然不敢表现丝毫）。他瞧不起田福军主要是因为新任地委书记太不象个“大官”了，动不动就泥手泥脚和老百姓混在一起，象个公社干部。作为秘书，白元断定：大领导就应该有大领导的威严和威风。田福军太没架子了！太随和了！这哪象个地委书记？ \n　　白元就是这样理解“大官”的。生活中有那么一种人，你蔑视甚至污辱他，他不仅视为正常，还对你挺佩服；你要是在人格上对他平等相待，他反而倒小看你！这种人的情况，在伟在鲁迅的不朽著作中有详尽诠释，这里就不再累赘。 \n　　现在，这位秘书装出一副谦恭的样子，听田福军博学地和张有智谈古论今。他惊讶地看见，地委书记象个农民一样，竟然脱掉鞋�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福军<|>PERSON<|>田福军 is a local
