(See Ikhut-eigh!)\nSPACING GUILD: see Guild.\nSPICE: see Melange.\nSPICE DRIVER: any Dune man who controls and directs movable machinery on the desert surface of Arrakis.\nSPICE FACTORY: see Sandcrawler.\nSPOTTER CONTROL: the light ornithopter in a spice- hunting group charged with control of watch and protection.\nSTILLSUIT: body-enclosing garment invented on Arrakis. Its fabric is a micro-sandwich performing functions of heat dissipation and filter for bodily wastes. Reclaimed moisture is made available by tube from catchpockets.\nSTILLTENT: small, sealable enclosure of micro- Sandwich fabric designed to reclaim as potable water the ambient moisture discharged within it by the breath of its occupants.\nSTUNNER: slow-pellet projectile weapon throwing a poison- or drug-tipped dart. Effectiveness limited by variations in shield settings and relative motion between target and projectile.\nSUBAKH UL KUHAR: “Are you well?”: a Fremen greeting.\nSUBAKH UN NAR: “I am well. And you?”: traditional reply.\nSUSPENSOR: secondary (low-drain) phase of a Holtzman field generator. It nullifies gravity within certain limits prescribed by relative mass and energy consumption.\nT TAHADDI AL-BURHAN: an ultimate test from which there can be no appeal (usually because it brings\ndeath or destruction).\nTAHADDI CHALLENGE: Fremen challenge to mortal combat, usually to test some primal issue.\nTAQWA: literally: “The price of freedom.” Something of great value. That which a deity demands of a mortal (and the fear provoked by the demand).\nTAU, THE: in Fremen terminology, that oneness of a sietch community enhanced by spice diet and especially the tau orgy of oneness elicited by drinking the Water of Life.\nTEST-MASHAD: any test in which honor (defined as Spiritual standing) is at stake.\nTHUMPER: short stake with spring-driven clapper at one end. The purpose: to be driven into the sand and set “thumping” to summon shai-hulud.

(Note: “awareness spectrum” narcotics are frequently fatal except to desensitized individuals capable of transforming the poison-configuration within their own bodies.)\nTUPILE: so-called “sanctuary planet” (probably several planets) for defeated Houses of the Imperium. Location(s) known only to the Guild and maintained inviolate under the Guild Peace.\nU ULEMA: a Zensunni doctor of theology.\nUMMA: one of the brotherhood of prophets. (A term of scorn in the Imperium, meaning any “wild” person given to fanatical prediction.)\nUROSHNOR: one of several sounds empty of general meaning and which Bene Gesserit implant within the psyches of selected victims for purposes of control. The sensitized person, hearing the sound, is temporarily immobilized.\nUSUL: Fremen: “The base of the pillar.”\nV\nVAROTA: famed maker of balisets; a native of Chusuk.\nVERITE: one of the Ecaz will-destroying narcotics.

The aim is to reduce involvement of innocent bystanders. Rules prescribe formal declaration of intent and restrict permissible weapons.\nWATER BURDEN: Fremen: a mortal obligation.\nWATERCOUNTERS: metal rings of different size, each designating a specific amount of water payable out of Fremen stores. Watercounters have profound significance (far beyond the idea of money) especially in birth, death, and courtship ritual.\nWATER DISCIPLINE: that harsh training which fits the inhabitants of Arrakis for existence there without wasting moisture.\nWATERMAN: a Fremen consecrated for and charged with the ritual duties surrounding water and the Water of Life.\nWATER OF LIFE: an “illuminating” poison (see Reverend Mother). Specifically, that liquid exhalation of a sandworm (see Shai-hulud) produced at the moment of its death from drowning which is changed within the body of a Reverend Mother to become the narcotic used in the sietch tau orgy. An “awareness spectrum” narcotic.\nWATERTUBE: any tube within a stillsuit or stilltent that carries reclaimed water into a catchpocket or from the catchpocket to the wearer.\nWAY, BENE GESSERIT: use of the minutiae of observation.\nWEATHER SCANNER: a person trained in the special methods of predicting weather on Arrakis, including ability to pole the sand and read the wind patterns.\nWEIRDING: idiomatic: that which partakes of the mystical or of witchcraft.\nWINDTRAP: a device placed in the path of a prevailing wind and capable of precipitating moisture from the air caught within it, usually by a\nSharp and distinct drop in temperature within the trap.\nY\nYA HYA CHOUHADA: “Long live the fighters!” The Fedaykin battle cry. Ya (now) in this cry is augmented by the hya form (the ever-extended now). Chouhada (fighters) carries this added meaning of fighters against injustice. There is a distinction in this word that specifies the fighters are not struggling for anything, but are consecrated against a specific thing—that alone.\nYALI: a Fremen’s personal quarters within the sietch.\nYA! YA! YAWM!: Fremen chanting cadence used in time of deep ritual significance. Ya carries the root meaning of “Now pay attention!” The yawm form is a modified term calling for urgent immediacy. The chant is usually translated as “Now, hear this!”\nZ\nZENSUNNI: followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of Maometh (the so-called “Third Muhammed”) about 1381 B.G. The Zensunni religion is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to “the ways of the fathers.” Most scholars name Ali Ben Ohashi as leader of the original schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male spokesman for his second wife, Nisai.\nCARTOGRAPHIC NOTES\nBaseline for altitude determination: the Great Bled.\nBasis for latitude: meridian through Observatory Mountain.\nPolar Sink: 500 m. below Bled level.\nCarthag;: about 200 km. northeast of Arrakeen.\nCave of Birds: in Habbanya Ridge.\nFuneral Plain: open erg.\nGreat Bled: open, flat desert, as opposed to the erg- dune area. Open desert runs from about 60° north to 70° south. It is mostly sand and rock, with occasional outcroppings of basement complex.\nGreat Flat: an open depression of rock blending into erg. It lies about 100 m. above the Bled. Somewhere in the Flat is the salt pan which Pardot Kynes (father of Liet-Kynes) discovered. There are rock outcroppings rising to 200 m. from Sietch Tabr south to the indicated sietch communities.\nHarg Pass: the Shrine of Leto’s skull overlooks this pass.\nOld Gap: a crevasse in the Arrakeen Shield Wall down to 2240 m.; blasted out by Paul-Muad’Dib.\nPalmaries of the South: do not appear on this map. They lie at about 40° south latitude.\nRed Chasm: 1582 m. below Bled level.\nRimwall West: a high scarp (4600 m.) rising out of the Arrakeen Shield Wall.\nWind Pass: cliff-walled, this opens into the sink villages.\nWormline: indicating farthest north points where worms have been recorded.

He was a magnificent human being, a man of great honor and distinction, and the most interesting person at any gathering, drawing listeners around him like a magnet. To say he was an intellectual giant would be an understatement, since he seemed to contain all of the knowledge of the universe in his marvelous mind. He was my father, and | loved him deeply.\nNonetheless, a son’s journey to understand the legendary author was not always a smooth one, as | described in my biography of him, Dreamer of Dune. Growing up in Frank Herbert’s household, | did not understand his need for absolute silence so that he could concentrate, the intense desire he had to complete his important writing projects, or the confidence he had that one day his writing would be a success, despite the steady stream of rejections that he received. To my young eyes, the characters he created in Dune and his other stories were the children of his mind, and they competed with me for his affections. In the years it took him to write his magnum opus, he spent more time with Paul Atreides than he did with me. Dad’s study was off-limits to me, to my sister Penny, and to my brother Bruce. In\nthose days, only my mother Beverly really understood Dad’s complexities.
