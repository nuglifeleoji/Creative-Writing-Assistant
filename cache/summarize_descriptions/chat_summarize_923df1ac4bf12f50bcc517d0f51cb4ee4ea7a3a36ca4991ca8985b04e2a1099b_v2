The Sardaukar, the elite military forces of the Padishah Emperor, operate in disguise as Harkonnen troops during the attack on Arrakeen, concealing the Emperor's direct involvement in the conflict. This collaboration demonstrates a strategic alliance between the Harkonnens and the Emperor, with the Harkonnens employing the Sardaukar's combat prowess to strengthen their assault. The disguised Sardaukar highlight the covert nature of the Emperor's support for the Harkonnens, ensuring plausible deniability while decisively opposing Paul's forces.
