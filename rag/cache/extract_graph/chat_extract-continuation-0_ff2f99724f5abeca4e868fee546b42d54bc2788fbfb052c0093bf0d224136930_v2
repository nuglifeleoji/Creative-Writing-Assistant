He blew himself up in that decoy ship. They identified him from bits of two fingers and one intact eye. There was nothing left big enough to probe.”\n“But you have doubts! Get to them!”\n“Schwangyu left a message that only we might read.”\n“In the wear marks on furniture?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior, and—”\n“Then she knew she would be attacked and had time to leave a message. | saw your earlier report on the devastation of the attack.”\n“It was quick and totally overpowering. The attackers did not try to take captives.”\n“What did she say?”\n“Whores.”\nTaraza tried to contain her shock, although she had been expecting that word. The effort to remain calm almost drained her energies. This was very bad. Taraza permitted herself a deep sigh. Schwangyu’s opposition had persisted to the end. But then, seeing disaster, she had made a proper decision. Knowing she would die without the opportunity to transfer her Memory Lives to another Reverend Mother, she had acted from the most basic loyalty. If you can do nothing else, arm your Sisters and frustrate the enemy.\nSo the Honored Matres have acted!\n“Tell me about your search for the ghola,” Taraza ordered.\n“We were not the first searchers over that ground, Mother Superior. There was much additional burning of trees and rocks and underbrush.”\n“But it was a no-ship?”\n“The marks of a no-ship.”\nTaraza nodded to herself. A silent message from Old Reliability?\n“How closely did you examine the area?”\n“I flew over it but on a routine trip from one place to another.”\nTaraza motioned Burzmali to a chair near the foot of her cot. “Sit down and relax. | want you to do some guessing for me.”\nBurzmali lowered himself carefully onto the chair. “Guessing?”\n“You were his favorite student. | want you to imagine that you are Miles Teg. You know you must get the ghola out of the Keep. You do not place your full trust in anyone around you, not even in Lucilla. What will you do?”\n“An unexpected thing, of course.”\n“Of course.”\nBurzmali rubbed his narrow chin. Presently, he said: “l trust Patrin. | trust him fully.”\n“All right, you and Patrin. What do you do?”\n“Patrin is a native of Gammu.”\n“I have been wondering about that myself,” she said.\nBurzmali looked at the floor in front of him. “Patrin and | will make an emergency plan long before it is needed. | always prepare secondary ways of dealing with problems.”\n“Very good. Now—the plan. What do you do?”\n“Why did Patrin kill himself?” Burzmali asked.\n“You're sure that’s what he did.”\n“You saw the reports. Schwangyu and several others were sure of it. | accept it. Patrin was loyal enough to do that for his Bashar.”\n“For you! You are Miles Teg now. What plan have you and Patrin concocted?”\n“| would not deliberately send Patrin to certain death.”\n“Unless?” “Patrin did that on his own. He might if the plan Originated with him and not with... me. He might do it to\nprotect me, to make sure no one discovered the plan.” “How could Patrin summon a no-ship without our learning of it?”\n“Patrin was a Gammu native. His family goes back to the Giedi Prime days.”\nTaraza closed her eyes and turned her head away from Burzmali. So Burzmali followed the same suggestive tracks that she had been probing in her mind. We knew Patrin’s origins. What was the significance of that Gammu association? Her mind refused to speculate. This was what came of allowing herself to become too tired! She looked once more at Burzmali.\n“Did Patrin find a way to make secret contact with family and old friends?”\n“We've explored every contact we could find.”\n“Depend on it; you haven’t traced them all.”\nBurzmali shrugged. “Of course not. | have not acted on that assumption.”\nTaraza took a deep breath. “Go back to Gammu. Take with you as much help as our Security can spare. Tell Bellonda those are my orders. You must insinuate agents into every walk of life. Find out who Patrin knew. What of his surviving family? Friends? Winkle them out.”\n“That will cause a stir no matter how careful we are. Others will know.”\n“That cannot be helped. And Burzmali!”\nHe was on his feet. “Yes, Mother Superior?”\n“The other searchers: You must stay ahead of them.”\n“May | use a Guild navigator?”\n“No!”\n“Then how—”\n“Burzmali, what if Miles and Lucilla and our ghola are still on Gammu?”\n“I’ve already told you that | do not accept the idea of their leaving in a no-ship!”\nFor a long silent period, Taraza studied the man standing at the foot of her cot. Trained by Miles Teg. The old Bashar’s favorite student. What was Burzmali’s trained instinct suggesting.\nIn a low voice, she prompted: “Yes?”\n“Gammu was Giedi Prime, a Harkonnen place.” “What does that suggest to you?”\n“They were rich, Mother Superior. Very rich.”\n“So?” “Rich enough to accomplish the secret installation of a no-room.. . even of a large no-globe.”\n“There are no records! Ix has never even vaguely suggested such a thing. They have not probed on Gammu for...”\n“Bribes, third-party purchases, many transshipments,” Burzmali said. “The Famine Times were very disruptive and before that there were all those millennia of the Tyrant.”\n“When the Harkonnens kept their heads down or lost them. Still, | will admit the possibility.”\n“Records could have been lost,” Burzmali said.\n“Not by us or the other governments that survived. What prompts this line of speculation?”\n“Patrin.”\n“Ahhhhh.”\nHe spoke quickly: “If such a thing were discovered, a Gammu native might know about it.”\n“How many of them would know? Do you think they could have kept such a secret for... Yes! | see what you mean. If it were a secret of Patrin’s family .. .”\n“| have not dared question any of them about it.”\n“Of course not! But where would you look... . without alerting...”\n“That place on the mountain where the no-ship marks were left.”\n“It would require you to go there in person!”\n“Very hard to conceal from spies,” he agreed. “Unless | went with a very small force and seemingly on another purpose.”\n“What other purpose?”\n“To place a funeral marker in memory of my old Bashar.”\n“Suggesting that we know he is dead? Yes!”\n“You've already asked the Tleilaxu to replace our ghola.”\n“That was a simple precaution and does not bearon... Burzmali, this is extremely dangerous. | doubt we can mislead the kinds of people who will observe you on Gammu.”\n“The mourning of myself and the people | take with me will be dramatic and believable.”\n“The believable does not necessarily convince a wary observer.”\n“Do you not trust my loyalty and the loyalty of the people | will take with me?”\nTaraza pursed her lips in thought. She reminded herself that fixed loyalty was a thing they had learned to improve upon from the Atreides pattern. How to produce people who command the utmost devotion. Burzmali and Teg both were fine examples.\n“It might work,” Taraza agreed. She stared speculatively at Burzmali. Teg’s favorite student could be right!\n“Then l'Il go,” Burzmali said. He turned to leave.\n“One moment,” Taraza said.\nBurzmali turned. “You will saturate yourselves with shere, all of you. And if you’re captured by Face Dancers—these new ones!—you must burn your own heads or shatter them completely. Take the necessary precautions.”\nThe suddenly sobered expression on Burzmali’s face reassured Taraza. He had been proud of himself for a moment there. Better to dampen his pride. No need for him to be reckless.\nWe have long known that the objects of our palpable sense experiences can be influenced by choice—both conscious choice and unconscious. This is a demonstrated fact that does not require that we believe some force within us reaches out and touches the universe. | address a pragmatic relationship between belief and what we identify as “real.” All of our judgments carry a heavy burden of ancestral beliefs to which we of the Bene Gesserit tend to be more susceptible than most. It is not enough that we are aware of this and guard against it. Alternative interpretations must always receive our attention.\n—MOTHER SUPERIOR TARAZA: ARGUMENT IN COUNCIL\ndd e od will judge us here,” Waff gloated.\nHe had been doing that at unpredictable moments all during this long ride across the desert. Sheeana appeared not to notice but Waff’s voice and comments had begun to wear on Odrade.\nThe Rakian sun had moved far down to the west but the worm that carried them appeared untiring in its drive across the ancient Sareer toward the remnant mounds of the Tyrant’s barrier wall.\nWhy this direction? Odrade wondered.\nNo answer Satisfied. The fanaticism and renewed danger from Waff, though, demanded immediate response. She called up the cant of the Shariat that she knew drove him.\n“Let God do the judging and not men.”\nWaff scowled at the taunting note in her voice. He looked at the horizon ahead and then up at the ‘thopters, which kept pace with them.\n“Men must do God’s work,” he muttered.\nOdrade did not answer. Waff had been deflected into his doubts and now would be asking himself: Did these Bene Gesserit witches really share the Great Belief?\nHer thoughts dove back into the unanswered questions, tumbling through all she knew about the worms of Rakis. Personal memories and Other Memories wove a mad montage. She could visualize robed Fremen atop a worm even larger than this one, each rider leaning back against a long hooked pole that dug into a worm’s rings as her hands now gripped this one. She felt the wind against her cheeks, the robe whipping against her shanks. This ride and others merged into a long familiarity.\nIt has been a long time since an Atreides rode this way.\nWas there a clue to their destination back in Dar-es-Balat? How could there be? But it had been so hot and her mind had been questing forward to what might happen on this venture into the desert. She had not been as alert as she might have been.\nIn common with every other community on Rakis, Dar-es- Balat pulled inward from its edges during the heat of the early afternoon. Odrade recalled the chafing of her new stillsuit while she waited in a building’s shadows near the western limits of Dar-es-Balat. She waited for the separate escorts to bring Sheeana and Waff from the safe houses where Odrade had installed them.\nWhat a tempting target she had made. But they had to be certain of Rakian compliance. The Bene Gesserit escorts delayed deliberately.\n“Shaitan likes the heat,” Sheeana had said.\nRakians hid from the heat but the worms came out then. Was that a significant fact, revealing the reason for this worm to take them in a particular direction?\nMy mind is bouncing around like a child’s ball\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Schwangyu was a Reverend Mother who opposed Taraza and left a message before her death<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>Patrin was a loyal associate of Miles Teg who blew himself up in a decoy ship<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, strategizing to recover the ghola and counter the Honored Matres<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURZMALI<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg's favorite student, tasked with finding the ghola on Gammu<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>Bashar and military leader, mentor to Burzmali, involved in the ghola's escape<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILIA<|>PERSON<|>A Bene Gesserit involved in the ghola's escape, not fully trusted by Miles Teg<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl with a unique connection to the worms of Rakis<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>A Tleilaxu Master, fanatical and dangerous, accompanying Odrade and Sheeana<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, strategizing and observing during the desert journey<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A violent and dominant group opposing the Bene Gesserit<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive and manipulative group known for genetic engineering<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIEDI PRIME<|>GEO<|>Former name of Gammu, a Harkonnen stronghold<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet with a Harkonnen history, now a key location in the search for the ghola<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>A desert planet, home to the worms and the Tyrant's legacy<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAR-ES-BALAT<|>GEO<|>A city on Rakis where Odrade and others prepared for their journey<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAREER<|>GEO<|>An ancient desert on Rakis, traversed by the worm carrying Odrade and Sheeana<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSTAGE EXCHANGE<|>EVENT<|>The negotiation and exchange involving the ghola and other key figures<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>TARAZA<|>Schwangyu opposed Taraza but left a loyal message before her death<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATRIN<|>MILES TEG<|>Patrin was a loyal associate of Miles Teg and sacrificed himself<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BURZMALI<|>MILES TEG<|>Burzmali was Miles Teg's favorite student and is continuing his mission<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BURZMALI<|>Taraza trusts Burzmali to find the ghola on Gammu<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres are a violent opposition to the Bene Gesserit<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Tleilaxu are manipulative and often oppose the Bene Gesserit<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIEDI PRIME<|>GAMMU<|>Giedi Prime is the former name of Gammu<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade is observing and strategizing with Sheeana during the desert journey<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>WAFF<|>Odrade is wary of Waff's fanaticism and danger<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>RAKIS<|>Sheeana has a unique connection to the worms of Rakis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>TLEILAXU<|>Waff is a Tleilaxu Master<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
