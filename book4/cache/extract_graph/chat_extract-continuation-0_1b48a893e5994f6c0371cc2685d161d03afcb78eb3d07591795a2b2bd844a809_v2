的人，现在也亲热得象兄弟一样并肩战斗了……天完全黑严以后，双水村顿时乱得象一座兵营。鸡叫狗咬，人声嘈杂，村中纵横交叉的道路上，都走着一串一串手拿各种工具的人。有的家庭已经全家大人娃娃一齐出动，把门也锁了。大队部的院子里，田万有的儿子田海民已经把拖拉机发动得轰隆隆价响。海民是大队会计兼拖拉机手，也是村里党支部的委员之一。孙玉亭站在拖拉机一边，正在发动机的吼叫声中，给他挑选的十几个年轻后生交待任务。为了行走干练，玉亭脱掉了自己缀麻绳的烂布鞋，换上了福堂送给他的那双黄胶鞋。那十几个后生一个个腰圆膀粗，摩拳擦掌，象战场上的“敢死队员”一样。这些后生一队二队的都有，既有姓金的，也有姓田的，今晚他们已把户族之见搁在一边，也不分一队二队，而站在同一个行列里，为他们绝望的双水村拼命了！他们现在正等待公窑里的“总指挥”田福堂下达命令，就准备立刻向石圪节进军！ \n　　与此同时，在村前米家镇方向的东拉河里，已经亮起了几十盏马灯。金俊山正指挥着村里大部分劳力和自动跑来的许许多多其他男女老少，开始加高坝梁。所有参战的人都紧张而激动。村里能出动的人都来了，连金波他妈这样的家属婆姨，也都拿起工具到了工地。虽然她们的男人在门外工作，但她们和自己的娃娃都在村中吃粮，因此她们和村里的人一样而为水焦急。 \n　　少平拿一把铁锨往架子车上装土，推车的是田五大叔——他爱和这个活泼的土艺术家一块干活。自从哥哥去了山西，他就一直在村里劳动，而没有回县城的学校去。本来他二爸孙玉亭让他到石圪节去放水，但他考虑他在石圪节上过两年初中，熟人多，而石圪节的坝就在学校前面，万一这行动被石圪节的人发现了，说不定要干一架——而这里面就可能有他当年的同学。他怎么好意思和同学去打架呢？因此他没答应二爸，就到这坝梁工地上来了。 \n　　所有参加劳动的人今晚上都兴奋得有说有笑。大家不久才发现，连“半脑壳”田二也跑来了。他不劳动，只是在河边捡些碎柴烂草往坝中剩下的那点水里扔。他一边“嘿嘿”憨笑着，一边嘴思念着“世事要变了”的那句老经。在他那混乱的意识中，大概把水当成了火，因此才把捡来的柴草往水里扔呢！ \n　　这时，推土的田五倒罢一架子车土，就站在坝梁上说了几句“链子嘴”——
