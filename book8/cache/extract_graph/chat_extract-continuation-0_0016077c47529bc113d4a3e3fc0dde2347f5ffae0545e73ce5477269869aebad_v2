蓝轩宇盛好饭，在钱磊的带领下来到角落的一张桌子，这里几乎是整个食堂中最偏僻的位置了，此时已经坐了一个人，正埋头吃饭。\n\n    “疯子，咱们室友来了，认识一下。”钱磊在那男学生身边坐了下来，用肩膀碰了碰他。\n\n    被他叫做疯子的男生抬起头，看向蓝轩宇，蓝轩宇这才看清，这名男生看上去和自己身材相仿，双眸狭长，面部也略长，说不上好看，但却有种锋锐的感觉，和钱磊总是一脸笑容截然不同。\n\n    “你好，我是蓝轩宇。”蓝轩宇主动打招呼。\n\n    “我叫刘锋，你魂力多少级？”刘锋开门见山的问道。\n\n    “十四级吧。”蓝轩宇回答道。\n\n    “十四？”刘锋嘴角处流露出一丝讥笑，扭头看向钱磊，“估计跟你水平也差不多吧。呵呵。”\n\n    钱磊一脸的无奈，“才十四啊！哎……”\n\n    蓝轩宇眉头微蹙，“十四怎么啦？很低么？”\n\n    刘锋道：“不是很低，应该是最低吧。钱磊都是十五，虽然他也没啥用。”\n\n    蓝轩宇有些摸不着头脑，“魂力也不代表一切吧。还有，这等级和上学有什么关系么？”\n\n    钱磊道：“我来说吧。咱们班一共三十人，按照老师们最早的计划，每三个人一间宿舍，然后也就是一个小组。无论是修炼、战斗，甚至是选择辅助职业都会是一组。相辅相成，三为一体。因为魂师除了个体战斗之外，配合也是很重要的。班里内部会有排行，越靠前，得到的待遇也就越好。而且也越有机会留下来。可谁知道，招生的时候出了点问题，是二十名男生和十名女生。女生总不能和男生同宿舍啊！你来之前，二十九人，其中十九名男生，先是分成了五组，最后剩余两组都是两个人，而女生组则多了一人。我跟刘锋就是那两组之一。老师让我们两组比了一下，谁赢了，那名女生就加入谁的那一组。显而易见我们输了，而且输的很惨。所以，那名女生就加入他们那一组了，就是你认识的叶灵瞳。而我们俩因为只有两人，这俩月以来，自然是什么都垫底。”\n\n    “今天听说你来，我们心中可都是报以很大希望的，可谁知道，你也只有十四级。我十五级，疯子十六级。反正在班里咱们绝对是很靠后的了。咱们高能少年班，竞争无处不在啊！”\n\n    蓝轩宇这才明白，为什么钱磊刚见到自己的时候会那么热情了，“我会尽力的。”\n\n    刘锋看了他一眼，没再说什么，就是低下头吃饭。\n\n
