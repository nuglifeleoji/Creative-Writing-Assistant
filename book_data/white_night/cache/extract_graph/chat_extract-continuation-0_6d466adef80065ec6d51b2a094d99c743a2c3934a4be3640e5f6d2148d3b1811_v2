   “哦。”蓝轩宇乖巧的答应一声。\n\n    看着儿子听话的样子，蓝潇心中暗叹，蓝轩宇什么都好，就是有点太乖巧了，有的时候，性格中还更多了几分胆怯。心理承受力略微有些脆弱。在同龄孩子中，绝对算不上坚强的。而这一切，都显得是那么正常而普通。可是，他心中却知道，自己这个儿子绝不是普通和正常的角色啊！\n\n    “嗖！”车载导航精准的驱动着魂导飞车驶出了空中高速，减速后再转个弯，一扇金属门已经提前开启。进入到一栋大楼的内部通道。\n\n    蓝潇操作着显示屏上的设置，按照指示抵达位于大楼之中的停车位。\n\n    车稳稳停下，解开安全带，蓝潇摸了摸儿子的头，道：“到了，我们走吧。”\n\n    父子二人下了车，蓝轩宇主动拉住蓝潇的手，抬头看向他，大眼睛中略微流露出一丝紧张。\n\n    “儿子，没事的。你忘了吗？在任何地方你都是最受欢迎的啊！”蓝潇蹲下身体，在蓝轩宇白嫩的面颊上轻轻的捏了捏，给他一个鼓励的微笑。\n\n    “嗯呢。”蓝轩宇点了点头，在幼儿园的时候，他可是全班的宠儿，无论是老师还是同学们都很喜欢他呢。这就是相貌带来的天赋。\n\n    连续换了两部电梯，他们终于来到了此行的目的地，位于大楼九层的报名处。事实上，这座高达三十二层，全部金属结构的大楼，都是紫萝城分院的。\n\n    此时前面已经有一些家长带着孩子在排队进行报名登记了。蓝潇带着儿子排在后面。他习惯性的穿着军装，但中校军衔显然在家长中不算什么。就在他们前面，一名有着两杠四星的大校就牵着一个小女孩儿，看上去，年纪也就和蓝潇差不多的样子。\n\n    登记进行的很快，主要就是核实身份，并且进行简单的魂力测试。然后就是孩子进去，家长离开。家长唯一能得到的，就是晚上接孩子的时间而已。\n\n    很快就轮到前面那名大校带着的小女孩儿了。\n\n    负责登记的老师可能是看到了她父亲的军衔，对她的态度格外和蔼，微笑着问道：“小美女，你叫什么名字啊！”\n\n    小姑娘确实很漂亮，一头浅棕色的长发略带自来卷，肌肤白皙，在同龄孩子中身高中等，眼瞳是漂亮的浅绿色，瞳孔还有些发祖母绿的深蓝。\n\n    看着登记老师，她甜甜的一笑，“老师好，我叫叶灵瞳。”\n\n    “名字真好听。老师要和你核实一下身\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
