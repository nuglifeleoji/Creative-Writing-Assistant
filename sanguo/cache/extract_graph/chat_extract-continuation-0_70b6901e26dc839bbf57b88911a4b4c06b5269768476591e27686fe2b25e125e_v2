��然。斩魏延者，乃马岱也。原来孔明临终之时，授马岱以密计，只待魏延喊叫时，便出其不意斩之；当日，杨仪读罢锦囊计策，已知伏下马岱在彼，故依计而行，果然杀了魏延。后人有诗曰：“诸葛先机识魏延，已知日后反西川。锦囊遗计人难料，却见成功在马前。”\n\n    却说董允未及到南郑，马岱已斩了魏延，与姜维合兵一处。杨仪具表星夜奏闻后主。后主降旨曰：“既已名正其罪，仍念前功，赐棺椁葬之。”杨仪等扶孔明灵柩到成都，后主引文武官僚，尽皆挂孝，出城二十里迎接。后主放声大哭。上至公卿大夫，下及山林百姓，男女老幼，无不痛哭，哀声震地。后主命扶柩入城，停于丞相府中。其子诸葛瞻守孝居丧。\n\n    后主还朝，杨仪自缚请罪。后主令近臣去其缚曰：“若非卿能依丞相遗教，灵柩何日得归，魏延如何得灭。大事保全，皆卿之力也。”遂加杨仪为中军师。马岱有讨逆之功，即以魏延之爵爵之。仪呈上孔明遗表。后主览毕，大哭，降旨卜地安葬。费祎奏曰：“丞相临终，命葬于定军山，不用墙垣砖石，亦不用一切祭物。”后主从之。择本年十月吉日，后主自送灵柩至定军山安葬。后主降诏致祭，谥号忠武侯；令建庙于沔阳，四时享祭。后杜工部有诗曰：“丞相祠堂何处寻，锦官城外柏森森。映阶碧草自春色，隔叶黄鹏空好音。三顾频烦天下计，两朝开济老臣心。出师未捷身先死，长使英雄泪满襟！”又杜工部诗曰：“诸葛大名垂宇宙，宗臣遗像肃清高。三分割据纡筹策，万古云霄一羽毛。伯仲之间见伊吕，指挥若定失萧曹。运移汉祚终难复，志决身歼军务劳。”\n\n    却说后主回到成都，忽近臣奏曰：“边庭报来，东吴令全琮引兵数万，屯于巴丘界口，未知何意。”后主惊曰：“丞相新亡，东吴负盟侵界，如之奈何？”蒋琬奏曰：“臣敢保王平、张嶷引兵数万屯于永安，以防不测。陛下再命一人去东吴报丧，以探其动静。”后主曰：“须得一舌辩之士为使。”一人应声而出曰：“微臣愿往。”众视之，乃南阳安众人，姓宗，名预，字德艳，官任参军、右中郎将。后主大喜，即命宗预往东吴报丧，兼探虚实。宗预领命，径到金陵，入见吴主孙权。礼毕，只见左右人皆着素衣。权作色而言曰：“�\n######################\nOutput:",
