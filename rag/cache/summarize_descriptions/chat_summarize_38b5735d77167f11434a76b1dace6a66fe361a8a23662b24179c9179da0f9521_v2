This anxiety stems from the Face Dancer's ability to assume his identity, potentially undermining his relationships and mission. The threat is not merely theoreticalâ€”the Face Dancer has already attempted to assassinate Duncan, demonstrating its lethal intent and the danger it poses.  \n\nThe attempted assassination underscores the Face Dancer's hostility and its role as a direct adversary to Duncan. At the same time, Duncan's fear of being misidentified highlights the psychological toll of their conflict, as he must remain vigilant against both external attacks and the possibility of being falsely accused.
