Follow the arrows like that one on the floor. They'll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to another exit where I’ve secreted a ‘thopter. There’s a storm across the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing ‘thopters. If you stay high in the storm you'll survive.”\n“What of you?” Paul asked.\n“I'll try to escape another way. If I’m captured... well, I’m still Imperial Planetologist. | can say | was your captive.”\nRunning like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can l live to avenge my father? He turned to face the door.\nJessica heard him move, said, “Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.”\n“FII take full payment for them all one day,” Paul said.\n“Not unless you hurry now,” Kynes said.\nPaul felt the man’s hand on his shoulder.\n“Where will we meet, Kynes?” Paul asked.\n“FIL send Fremen searching for you. The storm’s path is known. Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.”\nThey heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.\nJessica found Paul’s hand, pulled him gently. “We must not get separated,” she said.\n“Yes.”\nHe followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.\nThey crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.\nThey were running now.\nPlans within plans within plans within plans, Jessica thought. Have we become part of someone else’s plan now?\nThe arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up. They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its center.\nPaul pressed the handle.\nThe wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft.\n“Where did Kynes go?” Jessica asked.\n“He did what any good guerrilla leader would,” Paul said. “He separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldn’t reveal where we are if he’s captured. He won't really know.”\nPaul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor.\n“No one’s been here for a long time,” he said.\n“He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,” she said.\n“I share that confidence.”\nPaul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter’s left door, opened it, and secured his pack in the rear. “This ship’s proximity masked,” he said. “Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the Harkonnens taught them to be thorough.”\nJessica leaned against the craft’s other side, catching her breath.\n“The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area,” she said. “They’re not stupid.” She considered her direction sense, pointed right. “The storm we saw Is that way.”\nPaul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the here-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.\n“The longer we wait the better prepared they'll be,” Jessica said.\n“Get in and strap yourself down,” he said.\nHe joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this was blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.\n“If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.” It was a Bene Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into that trap...if he lived through this.\nPaul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate metal interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten for jet-boost takeoff the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were armed. Turbines began their low hissing.\n“Ready?” he asked.\n“Yes.”\nHe touched the remote control for lights.\nDarkness blanketed them.\nHis hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul’s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure.\nA wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door-wall had\nbeen. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.\nPaul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings snapped back and down, hurling the ‘thopter out of its nest. Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.\nJessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the sureness of her son’s movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated. Now, Paul’s training is our only hope, she thought. His youth and swiftness.\nPaul fed more power to the jetpods. The ‘thopter banked, sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave the craft more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining the ribbon trail of the storm.\nPaul’s hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. G-force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.\n“Jetflares behind us!” Jessica said.\n“I saw them.”\nHe slammed the power arm forward.\nTheir ‘thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking beneath the\ndunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows —dunes diminishing one into another.\nAnd above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars.\nSomething jarred the 'thopter.\n“Shellburst!” Jessica gasped. “They’re using some kind of projectile weapon.”\nShe saw a sudden animal grin on Paul’s face. “They seem to be avoiding their lasguns,” he said.\n“But we've no shields!”\n“Do they know that?”\nAgain the ‘thopter shuddered.\nPaul twisted to peer back. “Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us.”\nHe returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.\n“Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry—that’s one thing we'll give the Fremen,” Paul whispered.\n“The storm,” Jessica said. “Hadn’t you better turn?”\n“What about the ship behind us?”\n“He’s pulling up.”\n“Now!”\nPaul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.\nThey appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft became a long,\nhorizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel.\nThrough Jessica’s mind flashed all the warnings about such storms—that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones. She felt the buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls. She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled.\n“Sand!” Jessica shouted.\nShe saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. “Not much sand this high.”\nBut she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.\nPaul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.\nThe sound of their passage diminished.\nThe ‘thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.\nJessica had the eerie feeling that they were Standing still, that all motion was external. A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.\nWinds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour, she thought. Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her. I must not fear, she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer.\nSlowly her long years of training prevailed.\nCalmness returned.\n“We have the tiger by the tail,” Paul whispered. “We can’t go down, can’t land...and | don’t think | can lift us out of this. We'll have to ride it out.”\nCalmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together. Then she heard Paul’s voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:\n“Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me | will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only | will remain.”\nWhat do you despise? By this are you truly known.\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n“ T hey are dead, Baron,” said lakin Nefud, the guard captain. “Both the woman and the boy are certainly dead.”\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep Suspensors of his private quarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters, though, the ship’s harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects.\n“It is a certainty,” the guard captain said. “They are dead.”\nThe Baron shifted his gross body in the Suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline Statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded Suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\n“They're certainly dead, Baron,” the man repeated.\nThe Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud’s eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep\nwithin the drug’s rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.\n“I have a full report,” Nefud said.\nLet him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear—sharp and", " art objects.\n“It is a certainty,” the guard captain said. “They are dead.”\nThe Baron shifted his gross body in the Suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline Statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded Suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\n“They're certainly dead, Baron,” the man repeated.\nThe Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud’s eyes.

One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear—sharp and ready.\n“Have you seen their bodies?” the Baron rumbled.\nNefud hesitated.\n“Well?”\n“M’Lord...they were seen to dive into a sandstorm...winds over eight hundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m’Lord. Nothing! One of our own craft was destroyed in the pursuit.”\nThe Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the man’s jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.\n“You have seen the bodies?” the Baron asked.\n“M’Lord—”\n“For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?” the Baron roared. “To tell me a thing is certain when it is not? Do you think lIl praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?”\nNefud’s face went bone pale.\nLook at the chicken, the Baron thought. / am surrounded by such useless clods. If | scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he’d peck at it.\n“The man Idaho led us to them, then?” the Baron asked.\n“Yes, m’Lord!”\nLook how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought. He said: “They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Is there more to this...report?”\n“The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, m’Lord. Idaho joined this Kynes under mysterious circumstances...| might even say suspicious circumstances.”\n“Soe”\n“They...ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it’s apparent the boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement of the chase, several of our groups were caught In a lasgun-shield explosion.”\n“How many did we lose?”\n“l’m...ah, not sure yet, m’Lord.”\nHe’s lying, the Baron thought. /t must’ve been pretty bad.\n“The Imperial lackey, this Kynes,” the Baron said. “He was playing a double game, eh?”\n“I'd stake my reputation on it, m’Lord.”\nHis reputation!\n“Have the man killed,” the Baron said.\n“M'Lord! Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majesty’s own serv—”\n“Make it look like an accident, then!”\n“M'Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now.”\n“Get him away from them. Say | wish to question him.”\n“If they demur?”\n“They will not if you handle it correctly.”\nNefud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“The man must die,” the Baron rumbled. “He tried to help my enemies.”\nNefud shifted from one foot to the other.\n“Well?”\n“M’Lord, the Sardaukar have...two persons in custody who might be of interest to you. They’ve caught the Duke’s Master of Assassins.”\n“Hawat? Thufir Hawat?”\n“I’ve seen the captive myself, m’Lord. ’Tis Hawat.”\n“I'd not’ve believed it possible!”\n“They say he was knocked out by a stunner, m’Lord. In the desert where he couldn’t use his Shield. He’s virtually unharmed. If we can get our hands on him, he'll provide great sport.”\n“This is a Mentat you speak of,” the Baron growled. “One doesn’t waste a Mentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat? Could he know the extent of...but no.”\n“He has spoken only enough, m’Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady Jessica was his betrayer.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h.”\nThe Baron sank back, thinking; then: “You’re sure? It’s the Lady Jessica who attracts his anger?”\n“He said it in my presence, m’Lord.”\n“Let him think she’s alive, then.”\n“But, m’Lord—”\n“Be quiet. | wish Hawat treated kindly. He must be told nothing of the late Doctor Yueh, his true betrayer. Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending his\nDuke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, feed his suspicions against the Lady Jessica.\n“M’Lord, | don’t—”\n“The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information. False information—false results.”\n“Yes, m’Lord, but...”\n“Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?”\n“M’Lord, Hawat’s still in the hands of the Sardaukar!”\n“Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from Hawat as | am. I’ve noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud. They’re not very devious...politically. | do believe this is a deliberate thing; the Emperor wants it that way. Yes. | do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.”\nNefud looked unhappy. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“You will tell the Sardaukar commander that | wish to question both Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other. He can understand that much, I think.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“And once we have them in our hands....” The Baron nodded.\n“M’Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any...questioning.”\n“I’m sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud.”\n“I understand, m’Lord. That’s when Kynes can have his accident.”\nn\n“Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will have a real accident. It’s Hawat | want. Yes. Ah, yes.”\nNefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.\n“Hawat will be given both food and drink,” the Baron said. “Treated with kindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries. And you will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawat’s diet from this point on...unless | say otherwise.”\n“The antidote, yes.” Nefud shook his head. “But—”\n“Don’t be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter. | need a replacement.”\n“Hawat?”\n“Hawat.”\n“But—”\n“You're going to say Hawat’s completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he’s not to blame for the Duke’s demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable Thufir Hawat.”\n“Woo him. Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat’s right. Hawat will see a certain element of\ntruth in this. The Duke couldn’t afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information.” The Baron stared at Nefud. “Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud. The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.”\n“With wealth. Yes, m’Lord.”\n“We will woo Hawat,” the Baron said. “We will hide him from the Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve... the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison. There’s no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never suspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.”\nNefud’s eyes opened wide with understanding.\n“The absence of a thing,” the Baron said, “this can be as deadly as the presence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything else we're addicted to.” The Baron nodded. “You understand me, Nefud?”\nNefud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.”\n“At once, m’Lord.” Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.\nHawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If they suspect anything at all it’s that | wish to destroy the Mentat. And this suspicion l'Il confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they'll toss him to me like some\nsilly toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.\nThe Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his Suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.\nAnd all the Atreides dead!\nThe stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter...or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet...all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor's ears alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.\nPower and fear—fear and power!\nThe Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this Rabban he’d summoned, of course. But Rabban’s younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a Sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed...a ferocity.\nA lovely boy, the Baron thought. A year or two more—say, by the time he’s seventeen, l'Il know for certain whether he’s the tool that House Harkonnen requires to gain the throne.\n“M’Lord Baron.”\nThe man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron’s bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line’s narrow-set eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some\nrigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that he’d come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.\nA muscle", " One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor.

There was yet some\nrigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that he’d come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.\nA muscle-minded tank-brain, the Baron thought. No Mentat, my nephew...not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he'll grind over everything in his path. Oh, how he'll be hated here on Arrakis!\n“My dear Rabban,” the Baron said. He released the doorfield, but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe.\n“You summoned me,” Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a Suspensor chair, found none.\n“Stand closer where | can see you easily,” the Baron said.\nRabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.\n“The Atreides are dead,” the Baron said. “The last of them. That’s why | summoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again yours.”\nRabban blinked. “But | thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the—”\n“Piter, too, is dead.”\n“Piter?”\n“Piter.”\nThe Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration.\n“You finally tired of him, eh?” Rabban asked.\nHis voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy- blanketed room.\n“I will say a thing to you just this once,” the Baron rumbled. “You insinuate that | obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle.” He snapped fat fingers. “Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. | will take it unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that | am so stupid.”\nFear showed in the squinting of Rabban’s eyes. He knew within certain limits how far the old Baron would go against family. Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments could be painful.\n“Forgive me, m’Lord Baron,” Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience.\n“You do not fool me, Rabban,” the Baron said.\nRabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.\n“| make a point,” the Baron said. “Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for an overriding purpose—and know your purpose!”\nAnger spoke in Rabban: “But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! | saw his body being carried out as | arrived last night.”\nRabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.\nBut the Baron smiled. “I’m very careful about dangerous weapons,” he said. “Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke.” Strength poured into the Baron’s voice. “/suborned a doctor of the Suk\nSchool! The /nner School! You hear, boy? But that’s a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. | didn’t obliterate him casually.”\n“Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?”\nThis was a penetrating question, the Baron thought. Have I misjudged this nephew?\n“The Emperor doesn’t know it yet,” the Baron said. “But his Sardaukar are sure to report it to him. Before that happens, though, l'Il have my own report in his hands through CHOAM Company channels. | will explain that | /ucki/y discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you understand? Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk School, this will be accepted.”\n“Ah-h-h, | see,” Rabban murmured.\nAnd the Baron thought: /ndeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret. The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. Why did | do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine—the nephew I must use and discard? The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.\n“It must be kept secret,” Rabban said. “I understand.”\nThe Baron sighed. “I give you different instructions about Arrakis this time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, | held you in strong rein. This time, | have only one requirement.”\n“M’Lord?”\n“Income.”\n“Income?”\n“Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?”\n“Expensive, eh?”\n“Expensive!”\nThe Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. “If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, you'll just barely repay us!”\nRabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.\n“Expensive,” the Baron sneered. “The damnable Guild monopoly on space would've ruined us if | hadn’t planned for this expense long ago. You should know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar.”\nAnd not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were insidious—bleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and pay and pay.\nAlways, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. “Hazard rates,” the oily Guild agents explained. And for every agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.\nInsufferable!\n“Income then,” Rabban said.\nThe Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. “You must squeeze.”\n“And | may do anything I wish as long as | Squeeze?”\n“Anything.”\n“The cannons you brought,” Rabban said. “Could |\n”\n“l'm removing them,” the Baron said.\n“But you—”\n“You won’t need such toys. They were a special innovation and are now useless. We need the metal. They cannot go against a shield, Rabban. They were merely the unexpected. It was predictable that the Duke’s men would retreat into cliff caves on this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them In.”\n“The Fremen don’t use shields.”\n“You may keep some lasguns if you wish.”\n“Yes, m’Lord. And | have a free hand.”\n“AS long as you squeeze.”\nRabban’s smile was gloating. “I understand perfectly, m’Lord.”\n“You understand nothing perfectly,” the Baron growled. “Let us have that clear at the outset. What you do understand is how to carry out my orders. Has it occurred to you, Nephew, that there are at least five million persons on this planet?”\n“Does m’Lord forget that | was his regent-siridar here before? And if m’Lord will forgive me, his estimate may be low. It’s difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the Fremen of\n”\n“The Fremen aren’t worth considering!”\n“Forgive me, m’Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.”\nThe Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. “You know something?”\n“M'Lord had retired when | arrived last night. I... ah, took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from...ah, before. They’ve been acting as guides to the Sardaukar. They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar force somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out.”\n“Wiped out a Sardaukar force?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Impossible!”\nRabban shrugged.\n“Fremen defeating Sardaukar,” the Baron sneered.\n“I repeat only what was reported to me,” Rabban said. “It is said this Fremen force already had captured the Duke’s redoubtable Thufir Hawat.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h-h.”\nThe Baron nodded, smiling.\n“I believe the report,” Rabban said. “You’ve no idea what a problem the Fremen were.”\n“Perhaps, but these weren’t Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must’ve been Atreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as Fremen. It’s the only possible answer.”\nAgain, Rabban shrugged. “Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen. The Sardaukar already have launched a program to wipe out all Fremen.”\n“Good!”\n“But—”\n“It'll keep the Sardaukar occupied. And we’ll soon have Hawat. | know it! I can feel it! Ah, this has been a day! The Sardaukar off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize!”\n“M’Lord....” Rabban hesitated, frowning. “I’ve always felt that we underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in—”\n“Ignore them, boy! They’re rabble. It’s the populous towns, cities, and villages that concern us. A great many people there, eh?”\n“A great many, m’Lord.”\n“They worry me, Rabban.”\n“Worry you?”\n“Oh...ninety per cent of them are of no concern. But there are always a few...Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who might try a dangerous thing. If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what happened here, I’d be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I'd be?”\nRabban swallowed.\n“You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor,” the Baron said. “As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was straightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though. That is the Story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.”\n“As the Emperor wishes it,” Rabban said.\n“As the Emperor wishes it.”\n“What about the smugglers?”\n“No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At any rate, you'll be Spreading some bribes in that quarter...and taking other measures which I’m sure you can think of.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are—slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel.
