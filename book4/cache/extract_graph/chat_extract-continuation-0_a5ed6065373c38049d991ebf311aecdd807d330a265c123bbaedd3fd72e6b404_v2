\n　　“慢慢碰吧……爸爸，天不早了，咱们回去吧！家里人一定心焦得不知咱两个出了什么事。” \n　　于是，孙少安父子俩就站起来，拍了拍身上的土，出了高粱地，在月光下顺着公路回家去了…… \n                  第24章\n　　晚上，当孙少安在自己的那个小土窑里睡着以后，孙玉厚老汉还大睁着眼睛望着黑暗的窑顶。老汉睡不着，爬起来点着一锅旱烟，坐在炕上吧嗒吧嗒地抽着。 \n　　少安他妈欠起身子，问丈夫：“怎啦？” \n　　“不怎……你睡你的。”孙玉厚继续抽着旱烟。后炕头上，老母亲在睡梦中发出一阵阵呻吟——唉，老人浑身都是病，睡梦中都是疼痛的…… \n　　孙玉厚仍然想着给孙少安娶媳妇的事。 \n　　他现在越来越感到太对不起儿子了。人家的儿子到这般年龄，都已经有了娃娃，可少安至今还单身一人。二十三岁，对公家人来说，还不算大；可一个农民，岁数已经到山梁上了。再不抓紧，眼看着就误了娃娃一辈子的大事。 \n　　不行！得赶紧办这件事。出财礼就出财礼！他在六○年那么困难的时候，都给玉亭娶了媳妇，而今他为什么不能给少安娶媳妇呢？他发现他年纪的确大了，已经丧失尽了魄力。 \n　　他现在应该重新鼓起劲来，打闹着也要给儿子娶媳妇！ \n　　他盘腿坐在炕上，一边抽烟，一边想他得赶紧出动——甚至都等不得天明了。 \n　　他一夜没有合眼。 \n　　第二天早晨，他先没忙着出山，一个人心急火燎地去了他弟玉亭家。他昨夜盘算：玉亭去冬今春在公社的农田基建工地上负责，各村基建队来了不少女娃娃，玉亭大概都认识，说不定里面有比较合适的，看能不能给他提供个线索，他好再央人去说媒。 \n　　他在玉亭和贺凤英出山之前，进了他从前居住过的这个院落。自从他搬出这里以后，没事他很少再来这里。现在他看见玉亭两口子把这院地方住得象庙坪那座破庙一般败落，连墙都倒塌了，心里忍不住咒骂这两个败家子：什么懒东西！把好好一个地方弄得象驴圈一样。 \n　　他进了玉亭家的门，窑里黑咕隆咚，弥漫着湿柴烧出的死烟，呛得他咳嗽起来。唉！当年他住在这窑洞的时候，尽管穷得没什么摆设，但少安妈收拾得汤清水利，亮亮堂堂的，这现在完全成了个黑\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
