Central to this project is the resurrection of **Duncan Idaho**, a key historical figure, whose ghola form is tied to the Bene Gesserit's political and economic power struggles. The project involves not only the awakening of these gholas but also their training and protection, with notable figures such as **Miles Teg** and **Lucilla** tasked with safeguarding and guiding them.  \n\nThe project's objectives appear multifaceted: it serves as a means to resurrect influential figures from the past, potentially for strategic or ideological purposes, while also playing a role in the Bene Gesserit's broader, long-term plans. Duncan Idaho's ghola, in particular, is emphasized as a critical component, suggesting his unique importance to the sisterhood. However, the project has encountered complications, including the reported disappearance of the ghola alongside Teg and Lucilla, indicating potential instability or external interference.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing the resurrection of Duncan Idaho specifically, others referencing gholas more generally—the overarching theme remains consistent: the **GHOLA PROJECT** is a high-stakes endeavor by the Bene Gesserit to harness the power of gholas, with Duncan Idaho's resurrection serving as a focal point. The project underscores the Bene Gesserit's manipulation of genetic memory, political influence, and clandestine operations to further their goals.\",7\n1757,ARAFEL,\"Arafel is the 'cloud darkness at the end of the universe,' a concept tied to the Tyrant's holy judgment. It is a word burned into the floor of Sietch Tabr, signifying danger and historical significance.\"\"\",3\n1892,GHOLA-TEG,\"**GHOLA-TEG** is a cloned recreation of the renowned military commander Miles Teg, engineered to preserve his unique abilities and knowledge. This ghola, currently in a childlike state, is undergoing preparation for memory restoration to reclaim the skills and experiences of the original Miles Teg. Notably, GHOLA-TEG is recognized for inheriting prescient abilities, a trait associated with the Bene Gesserit breeding program and the original Teg's extraordinary talents. The cloning process ensures the preservation of these capabilities, positioning GHOLA-TEG as a pivotal figure in future events. While still young, the ghola's development is carefully managed to facilitate the eventual awakening of its full potential, blending the legacy of Miles Teg with new possibilities.\",2\n1547,MILES TEG,\"**Miles Teg** is a complex and multifaceted figure in Bene Gesserit history, embodying roles as a military leader, Mentat, ghola, and key strategist. A ghola clone of the original Bashar Miles Teg, he was raised by the Bene Gesserit, displaying exceptional intelligence, memory, and latent Mentat abilities. He is the son of Janet and Loschy Teg, with Atreides ancestry, and the father of Odrade, whose memories and last words hold significance for the Sisterhood.  \n\nTeg serves as a retired Bashar and Military Mentat, often recalled for critical missions. He is a trusted weapons master and guardian tasked with protecting and training the ghola Duncan Idaho, employing brutal methods to reawaken Duncan's memories. His strategic brilliance and unexpected tactics earn him the nickname \"\"Old Reliability,\"\" drawing comparisons to Duke Leto Atreides. Teg mentors Duncan and Burzmali, shaping their military acumen with his deep understanding of human nature and improvisational combat skills.  \n\nHis relationship with the Bene Gesserit is nuanced; while loyal, he occasionally challenges their doctrines, forcing revisions to historical records. As a philosopher and commander, he balances opposing forces, reflecting on strategy and honor. Teg leads pivotal battles, such as the defense of Junction against the Honored Matres, and oversees fugitive operations with tactical precision.  \n\nAt times, Teg appears as a young boy—either as a ghola in early training or in flashbacks to his childhood, where his mother’s influence is evident. His legacy spans generations, from his role in the ghola project to his posthumous recreation in *Chapterhouse: Dune*. Whether as a historical figure, a resurrected genius, or a ten-year-old prodigy, Miles Teg remains a cornerstone of Bene Gesserit military and philosophical endeavors.\",39\n1670,BARANDIKO INCIDENT,\"The Barandiko incident was a historical event where Miles Teg and Taraza worked together to prevent a violent confrontation, showcasing their strategic partnership.\"\"\",2\n1618,JANET ROXBROUGH-TEG,,8\n1546,PATRIN,\"**Patrin** is a loyal and trusted aide, batman, and former comrade of **Bashar Miles Teg**, deeply involved in Teg's operations and the defense against threats such as the **Face Dancers** and **Tleilaxu**. A native of **Gammu** and a seasoned soldier, Patrin first discovered the **no-globe complex** in his youth and kept it secret, later playing a key role in safeguarding the hidden sanctuary. He is described as Teg's tactical expert and squad leader, though he refused formal rank despite being entitled to the pay and courtesies of a **colonel-aide**.  \n\nPatrin assists Teg in training **Duncan Idaho**, overseeing schedules and conveying orders, though he, like Teg, avoids answering Duncan's questions about punishments. He is noted for his keen observations, frequently remarking on Teg's \"\"**Gammu look**,\"\" hinting at a shared genetic lineage. Patrin's loyalty is unwavering—he meticulously follows Teg's commands, manages **South Farm orders**, and serves as a spy on Gammu, providing critical intelligence.  \n\nHis most defining act is his **self-sacrifice** during the attack on the **Keep**, where he detonated a decoy ship to mislead **Schwangyu's searchers**, ensuring the group's escape. This heroic death underscores his role as a fragile yet vital link in Teg's plans, having been trained by Teg himself in the removal of such vulnerabilities.  \n\nPatrin is remembered as a historical figure tied to Teg, symbolizing both Teg's past and Duncan's potential. Whether as a guard, recruiter, or tactical advisor, his legacy is one of steadfast service, sacrifice, and quiet competence. Though now deceased, his contributions to Teg's missions and Duncan's training remain pivotal.\",6\n1669,MENTAT SCHOOL,\"The Mentat School trains individuals like Miles Teg to become human computers, capable of advanced data processing and strategic thinking.\"\"\",1\n1650,TYRANT,\"**Summary of the Entity \"\"TYRANT\"\" (Leto II, the God Emperor):**  \n\nThe Tyrant, also known as Leto II Atreides or the God Emperor, was a prescient ruler who governed the known universe for millennia, wielding absolute control and shaping humanity’s destiny through his Golden Path—a grand vision designed to ensure humanity’s survival. His reign was marked by despotic rule, earning him epithets like \"\"Shaitan,\"\" yet his actions were deeply calculated. He transformed into a hybrid sandworm symbiote, embodying both myth and absolute power, and his legacy persists long after his death.  \n\nA master manipulator, Leto II influenced the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, preserving them for his own purposes while他们也试图摆脱他的预言影响。他的话语和哲学继续指导着他们的审议，尤其是关于人类本性和未来战略的讨论。他被称为“关键原木”（key log），操纵着集体灵魂（Group Soul），并通过隐藏的香料储备（如在Sietch Tabr）和经济策略（如消耗哈克南家族的财富）施加间接控制。  \n\nThe Golden Path, his most enduring contribution, involved reshaping humanity through sexual forces, enforced migration, and the suppression of predictable futures to ensure物种的多样性。他的统治还留下了象征性遗产，如“Arafel”（审判的象征）和散布的警告信息。尽管他的方法残酷，但Bene Gesserit承认他对人性的深刻理解，甚至在他的设计中发现了持久的价值。  \n\n矛盾之处（如“暴君”与“救世主”的二元性）反映了他复杂的遗产：既是压迫者，又是必要的引导者。他的神话构建策略和沙虫形态进一步巩固了他作为历史与传说交织的人物地位。总之，Leto II的统治和Golden Path在《沙丘》宇宙中留下了不可磨灭的印记，持续影响着政治、宗教和人类进化。  \n\n（Word count: 298）\",25\n1761,FISH SPEAKER BUREAUCRACY,\"The Fish Speaker Bureaucracy is a historical political structure referenced by the Tyrant in his accusatory messages.\"\"\",1\n2083,MEMORY POEM,\"A poetic work by the Tyrant preserved by the Bene Gesserit\"\"\",1\n1615,SABINE TEG,\"Sabine Teg is Miles Teg's younger brother who was present during the family dinner.\"\"\",3\n1723,NO-GLOBE COMPLEX,\"A hidden, fossilized structure preserved from the time of the Tyrant, containing advanced technology and historical records.\"\"\",5\n1616,BENE GESSERIT TEACHER,\"A Bene Gesserit teacher, exemplified by Janet Roxbrough-Teg, who instructs her family even while on special duty.\"\"\",1\n1577,LOSCHY TEG,\"**LOSCHY TEG** is the father of Miles Teg, described as a thin man with a high forehead and dark eyes. He is portrayed as an observant and amused figure, particularly in his interactions with his wife, whose instructions he follows with a sense of humor. Professionally, Loschy Teg held a position within the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles (CHOAM), though the exact nature of his role varies slightly across descriptions. Some sources identify him as a **CHOAM station factor**, implying a managerial or administrative role, while others refer to him as a **minor functionary**, suggesting a less prominent position. Despite this discrepancy, it is clear that he was involved in CHOAM's business dealings, including interactions with the Bene Tleilax.  \n\nLoschy Teg’s character combines personal warmth with professional engagement, though his exact rank within CHOAM remains ambiguous. His physical appearance—marked by a high forehead and dark eyes—is consistently noted, as is his relationship with his son, Miles Teg. The descriptions collectively paint a picture of a man who balanced familial dynamics with corporate responsibilities, albeit in a role that may not have been among CHOAM’s highest echelons.  \n\nIn summary, **LOSCHY TEG** was a thin, observant man with a high forehead, known both for his amused compliance with his wife’s instructions and his work with CHOAM, either as a station factor or a minor functionary.

Additionally, she has drawn the attention of the Bene Gesserit, likely due to her genetic lineage, which may make her a candidate for their breeding programs. This combination of personal skepticism, familial responsibility, and strategic interest from the Bene Gesserit paints Dimela as a complex figure navigating competing loyalties and pressures.  \n\nHer role as both a caretaker of the estate and a person of interest to the Bene Gesserit highlights her dual significance—pragmatic in her daily responsibilities yet entangled in the broader political and genetic machinations of her universe. While her marriage to Firus suggests stability, her unease with Bene Gesserit influence introduces an undercurrent of conflict, making her a compelling character within the narrative.\",3\n1619,SABINE,\"Sabine is the younger brother of Miles Teg, who hero-worships his brother and later succumbs to poisoning on Romo.\"\"\",2\n1623,ROMO,\"Romo is the planet where Sabine was poisoned many years after the events described.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3873,GHOLA PROJECT,DUNCAN IDAHO,Duncan Idaho's ghola is the focal point of the Bene Gesserit's project,159\n4206,ODRADE,ARAFEL,\"Odrade discovers the word 'Arafel' in Sietch Tabr, recognizing its significance and feeling its ominous warning.\",112\n4556,ODRADE,GHOLA-TEG,Odrade is wary of ghola-Teg’s prescient talents,111\n3662,MILES TEG,TARAZA,\"**Miles Teg and Taraza** share a close and strategic working relationship, defined by mutual trust and professional reliance.
