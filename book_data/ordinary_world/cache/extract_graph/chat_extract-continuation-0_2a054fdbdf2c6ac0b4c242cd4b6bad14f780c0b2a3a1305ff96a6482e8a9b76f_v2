\n　　莉莉不到朋友家吃饭去了，开始忙着自己动手做饭。润叶也想上手，但被莉莉拒挡了，说：“现在你成了客人，不象咱们在原西县了！”在原西的时候，她两个经常一块做着吃饭，有时在小学她的宿舍，有时在县文化馆莉莉的宿舍。 \n　　两个好朋友吃完饭，一直到九点钟的时候，莉莉的男朋友武惠良才来了。 \n　　莉莉赶忙介绍润叶和她的惠良认识。 \n　　润叶一搭眼就知道，莉莉挑了个称心女婿。惠良人模样英俊不说，一副诚实相，看来是个很可靠的人。“你怎才来？”莉莉问她的男朋友。 \n　　“我一直在家等你呢！”惠良说。 \n　　莉莉笑了，说：“润叶来了，我就没去你那里……”惠良马上对润叶说：“莉莉常说起你。虽然没见过面，我已经很熟悉你了。不知道你来，否则咱们一块去我家吃饭……” \n　　“莉莉也在信上常说你的情况。”润叶对惠良说。他们正随便说话，武惠良却突然变了脸色，说：“你们知道不？今天天安门出事了！我刚听完联播节目，说天安门成千上万的人借悼念总理，进行‘反革命活动’，说公安局都出动了，看样子抓了许多人……其实，这再明白不过了！我刚还和几个同学议论，这是一场正义的群众运动被残酷地镇压了！我们的国家现在正如国歌里唱的，已经‘到了最危险的时候’！人民都成了反革命，而真正的反革命都戴着马克思主义的面具，在人民头上舞棍弄棒……”武惠良激动地说着，手在空中挥着，和刚才沉稳的模样判若两人。 \n　　这惊心动魄的消息，使润叶和杜莉莉都感到无比震惊。听着武惠良激动地议论，润叶早已把自己的不幸搁在了一边。是啊，只要是一个有良知的公民，当国家出现不幸的时候，个人的不幸马上就会自己退到次要的位置。 \n　　他们三个立刻开始议论起眼前国家的不幸状况来。他们正当年轻之时，一个个热血沸腾；甚至指名道姓骂起了江青！ \n　　正在他们愤怒地议论的时候，门里突然进来一个戴黑边眼镜的人。这人三十多岁，脸色黝黑，穿一身邋遢的衣服，头发零乱地飘散在额头。他进门以后，先打量了一眼润叶。 \n　　莉莉和惠良马上招呼来人坐在椅子上。莉莉对润叶介绍说：“这就是我们馆的贾老师！” \n　　“贾冰。”戴黑边眼镜的人向润叶点点头，自我介绍\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
