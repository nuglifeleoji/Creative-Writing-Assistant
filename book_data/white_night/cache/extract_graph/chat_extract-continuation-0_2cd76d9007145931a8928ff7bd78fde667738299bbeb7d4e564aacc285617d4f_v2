“轩宇不哭。没事的。有老师在，都会没事的。”娜娜轻轻的拍着他的背，安慰着他惊恐的心灵。\n\n    “你很勇敢，你保护在妈妈身前，你已经是男子汉了。”娜娜轻轻的抚摸着他的背，安抚着他的心。\n\n    而也就在这时，她随之转过身，看向那台黑色机甲，还有那在空中飞行过程中停顿下来的光束。\n\n    她的目光冰冷而沉静，下一瞬，那台机甲表面却开始出现了裂痕，“叮”的一声脆响。整台机甲就已经为之破碎，连同里面的驾驶员，也连同那道原本要吞噬南澄、蓝轩宇母子的魂导光束全部消失的一干二净。\n\n    “叮叮叮叮叮叮……”一声声脆响，就在这样的情况下纷纷响起，一道道悬浮在半空之中的匪徒，就那么一个个爆开，一个个泯灭。\n\n    蓝轩宇听到声音，想要抬头去看，却被娜娜用手掌挡住了眼睛。她只是默默的搂着他。\n\n    “全员撤退？”娜娜眼底再次闪过一抹冷意。一层淡银色的光芒闪过，周围原本的静止消失了，一切都在刹那间恢复了正常。\n\n    “轩宇——”南澄凄厉的呼喊声这时才从喉中冲出。\n\n    “妈妈！”蓝轩宇大叫一声，赶忙从娜娜怀中挣脱出来，向南澄跑了过去。\n\n    看着跑向南澄的蓝轩宇，娜娜呆了呆，眼底莫名的闪过一抹失落。\n\n    蓝轩宇一把抱住南澄，南澄嘴角处却是鲜血流淌不停，刚刚那一锤，她着实是受了重创啊！\n\n    娜娜缓步来到南澄身边，蹲下身子，一只手按在她背上，轻声道：“你很好。”\n\n    南澄愣了愣，有点没明白她的意思，但下一瞬，一股清凉的气息却已经迅速涌入全身，说不出的舒爽。伤痛竟是大大的降低了。\n\n    一圈圈银色光晕也随之从娜娜身上荡漾开来，已经死去的人没有变化，可那些受伤的民众们，却在银光的照耀下伤势快速的恢复着。一时间，呻吟声和痛叫声顿时大大的减少了。而所有人的目光，都不约而同的集中在了那银色的身影之上。\n\n    就在刚刚，他们虽然不能移动，可是，视觉和听觉还在，他们清楚的看到那一幕的发生。\n\n    他们完全不清楚，这有着一头银发的女子究竟是怎样的存在，而匪徒们却如同纸糊的一般，在她面前甚至连动手的机会都没有。\n\n    最重要的是，他们得救了！\n\n    南澄的情况很快稳定了下来，娜娜低头对她说道：“伤害\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
