�琦在江夏，知父病危，来至荆州探病，方到外门，蔡瑁当住曰：“公子奉父命镇守江夏，其任至重；今擅离职守，倘东吴兵至，如之奈何？若入见主公，主公必生嗔怒，病将转增，非孝也。宜速回。”刘琦立于门外，大哭一场，上马仍回江夏。刘表病势危笃，望刘琦不来；至八月戊申日，大叫数声而死。后人有诗叹刘表曰：“昔闻袁氏居河朔，又见刘君霸汉阳。总为牝晨致家累，可怜不久尽销亡！”\n\n    刘表既死，蔡夫人与蔡瑁、张允商议，假写遗嘱，令次子刘琮为荆州之主，然后举哀报丧。时刘琮年方十四岁，颇聪明，乃聚众言曰：“吾父弃世，吾兄现在江夏，更有叔父玄德在新野。汝等立我为主。倘兄与叔兴兵问罪，如何解释？”众官未及对，幕官李珪答曰：“公子之言甚善。今可急发哀书至江夏，请大公子为荆州之主，就命玄德一同理事：北可以敌曹操，南可以拒孙权。此万全之策也。”蔡瑁叱曰：“汝何人，敢乱言以逆主公遗命！”李珪大骂曰：“汝内外朋谋，假称遗命，废长立幼，眼见荆襄九郡，送于蔡氏之手！故主有灵，必当殛汝！”蔡瑁大怒，喝令左右推出斩之。李珪“至死大骂不绝。于是蔡瑁遂立刘琮为主。蔡氏宗族，分领荆州之兵；命治中邓义、别驾刘先守荆州；蔡夫人自与刘琮前赴襄阳驻扎，以防刘琦、刘备。就葬刘表之柩于襄阳城东汉阳之原，竟不讣告刘琦与玄德。\n\n    刘琮至襄阳，方才歇马，忽报曹操引大军径望襄阳而来。琮大惊，遂请蒯越、蔡瑁等商议。东曹掾傅巽进言曰：“不特曹操兵来为可忧；今大公子在江夏，玄德在新野，我皆未往报丧，若彼兴兵问罪，荆襄危矣。巽有一计，可使荆襄之民，安如泰山，又可保全主公名爵。”琮曰：“计将安出？”巽曰：“不如将荆襄九郡，献与曹操，操必重待主公也。”琮叱曰：“是何言也！孤受先君之基业，坐尚未稳，岂可便弃之他人？”蒯越曰：“傅公悌之言是也。夫逆顺有大体，强弱有定势。今曹操南征北讨，以朝廷为名，主公拒之，其名不顺。且主公新立，外患未宁，内忧将作。荆襄之民，闻曹兵至，未战而胆先寒，安能与之敌哉？”琮曰：“诸公善言，非我不从；但以先君之业，一旦弃与他人，恐贻笑\n######################\nOutput:",
