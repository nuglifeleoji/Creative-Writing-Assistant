Little other than the drawing to recall her origins but the view out any window might have been from Dar-es-Balat deep in Dune’s dry-lands.\nA small rustling sound at the doorway alerted Odrade. She turned and there was Sheeana. Almost shy the way she peered around the door before entering Mother Superior’s presence.\nMotion as words: “So she did come to my rooms. Good. Someone might have been careless with my invitation.”\nOdrade’s readied senses tingled with Sheeana’s presence. The youngest-ever Reverend Mother. You often thought of Quiet Little Sheeana. She was not always quiet nor was she small but the label stuck. She was not even mousy, but frequently quiet like a rodent waiting at the edge of a field for the farmer to leave. Then the mouse would come darting out to glean fallen grains.\nSheeana came fully into the room and stopped less than a pace from Odrade. “We've been too long apart, Mother Superior.”\nOdrade’s first impression was oddly jumbled.\nCandor and concealment?\nSheeana stood quietly receptive.\nThis descendant of Siona Atreides had developed an interesting face under the Bene Gesserit patina. Maturity working on her according to both Sisterhood and Atreides designs. Marks of many decisions firmly taken. The slender, dark-skinned waif with sun-streaked brown hair had become this poised Reverend Mother. Skin still dark from long hours\nin the open. Hair still sun-streaked. The eyes, though—the steely total blue that said: “I have been through the Agony.”\nWhat is it | sense in her?\nSheeana saw the look on Odrade’s face (Bene Gesserit naivete!) and knew this was the long-feared confrontation.\nThere can be no defense except my truth and I hope she stops short of a full confession!\nOdrade watched her former student with exquisite care, every sense open.\nFear! What do I sense? Something when she spoke?\nThe steadiness of Sheeana’s voice had been shaped into the powerful instrument Odrade had anticipated at their first meeting. Sheeana’s original nature (a Fremen nature if there ever was one!) had been curbed and redirected. That core of vindictiveness smoothed out. Her capacity for love and hatred brought under tight reins.\nWhy do I get the impression she wants to hug me?\nOdrade felt suddenly vulnerable.\nThis woman has been inside my defenses. No way to exclude her totally ever again.\nTamalane’s judgment came to mind: “She is one of those who keeps herself to herself Remember Sister Schwangyu? Like that one but better at it. Sheeana knows where she is going. We'll have to watch her carefully. Atreides blood, you know.”\n“I’m Atreides, too, Tam.”\n“Don't think we ever forget it! You think we’d just stand idly by if Mother Superior chose to breed on her own? There are limits to our tolerance, Dar.”\n“Indeed, this visit is long overdue, Sheeana.”\nOdrade’s tone alerted Sheeana. She stared back suddenly with that look the Sisterhood called “BG placid,” than which there probably was nothing more placid in the universe, nothing more completely a mask of what occurred behind it. This was not just a barrier, it was a nothing. Anything on this mask would be transgression. This, in itself, was betrayal.\nSheeana realized it immediately and responded with laughter.\n“I knew you would come probing! The hand-talk with Duncan, right?” Please, Mother Superior! Accept this.\n“All of it, Sheeana.”\n“He wants someone to rescue them if Honored Matres attack.”\n“That’s all?” Does she think me a complete fool?\n“No. He wants information about our intentions ... and what we're doing to meet the Honored Matre threat.”\n“What have you told him?”\n“Everything | could.” Truth is my only weapon. | must divert her!\n“Are you his friend at court, Sheeana?”\n“Yes!”\n“So am |.”\n“But not Tam and Bell?”\n“My informants tell me Bell now tolerates him.”\n“Bell? Tolerant?”\n“You misjudge her, Sheeana. It’s a flaw in you.” She is hiding something. What have you done, Sheeana?\n“Sheeana, do you think you could work with Bell?”\n“Because | tease her?” Work with Bell? What does she mean? Not Bell to head that damnable Missionaria project!\nA faint twitching lifted the corners of Odrade’s mouth. Another prank? Could that be it?\nSheeana was a prime gossip subject in Central’s dining rooms. Stories of how she teased Breeding Mistresses (especially Bell) and elaborately detailed accounts of seductions fleshed out with Honored Matre comparisons from Murbella spiced more than the food. Odrade had heard snatches of the latest story only two days ago. “She said, ‘I used the Let-him-misbehave method. Very effective with men who think they’re leading you down the garden path.\n“Tease? Is that what you do, Sheeana?”\nmu\n“An appropriate word: reshape by going against the natural inclination.” The instant the words were out of her mouth, Sheeana knew she had made a mistake.\nOdrade felt warning stillness. Reshape? Her gaze went to that odd black mound in the corner. She stared at it with a fixity that surprised her. It drank vision. She kept probing for coherence, something that spoke to her. Nothing responded, not even when she probed to her limits. And that’s its purpose!\n“It’s called ‘Void,’” Sheeana said.\n“Yours?” Please, Sheeana. Say someone else did it. The one who did this has gone where I cannot follow.\n“I did it one night about a week ago.”\nIs black plaz the only thing you reshape? “A fascinating comment on art in general.”\n“And not on art specific?”\n“I have a problem with you, Sheeana. You alarm some Sisters.” And me. There’s a wild place in you we have not found. Atreides gene markers Duncan told us to seek are in your cells. What have they given you?\n“Alarm my Sisters?”\n“Especially when they recall that you’re the youngest ever to survive the Agony.”\n“Except for Abominations.”\n“Is that what you are?”\n“Mother Superior!” She has never deliberately hurt me except as a lesson.\n“You went through the Agony as an act of disobedience.”\n“Wouldn’t you say rather that | went against mature advice?” Humor sometimes distracts her.\nPrester, Sheeana’s acolyte aide, came to the door and rapped lightly on the wall beside it until she had their attention. “You said | was to tell you immediately when the search teams returned.”\n“What do they report?”\nRelief in Sheeana’s voice?\n“Team eight wants you to look at their scans.”\n“They always want that!”\nSheeana spoke with forced frustration. “Do you want to look at the scans with me, Mother Superior?”\n“PI wait here.”\n“This won’t take long.”\nWhen they had gone, Odrade went to the western window: a clear view across rooftops to the new desert. Small dunes here. Almost sunset and that dry heat so reminiscent of Dune.\nWhat is Sheeana hiding?\nA young man, hardly more than a boy, had been sunning nude on a neighboring rooftop, face-up on a sea-green mattress with a golden towel across his face. His skin was a sun-warmed gold to match towel and pubic hair. A breeze touched a corner of the towel and lifted it. One languid hand came up and restored the cover.\nHow can he be idle? Night worker? Probably.\nIdleness was not encouraged and this was flaunting it. Odrade smiled to herself. Anyone could be excused for assuming he was a night worker. He might be depending on that specific guess. The trick would be to remain unseen by those who knew otherwise.\n/ will not ask. Intelligence deserves some rewards. And, after all, he could be a night worker.\nShe lifted her gaze. A new pattern emerging here: exotic sunsets. Narrow band of orange drawn along the horizon, bulging where the sun had just dipped below the land. Silvery blue above the orange went darker overhead. She had seen this many times on Dune. Meteorological explanations she did not care to explore. Better to let eyes absorb this transient beauty; better to permit ears and skin to feel sudden stillness descend upon this land in the quick darkness after the orange vanished.\nFaintly, she saw the young man pick up mattress and towel and vanish behind a ventilator.\nA sound of running in the corridor behind her. Sheeana entered almost breathless. “They found a spice mass thirty klicks northeast of us! Small but compact!”\nOdrade did not dare hope. “Could it be wind accumulation?”\n“Not likely. I’ve set a round-the-clock watch on it.” Sheeana glanced at the window where Odrade stood. She has seen Trebo. Perhaps...\n“I asked you earlier, Sheeana, if you could work with Bell. It was an important question. Tam is getting very old and must be replaced soon. There must be a vote, of course.”\n“Me?” It was totally unexpected.\n“My first choice.” /mperative now. | want you close where | can keep watch on you.\n“But | thought... I mean, the Missionaria’s plan...” “That can wait. And there must be someone else who can shepherd worms... if that spice mass is what we hope.”\n“Oh? Yes... several of our people but no one who... Don’t you want me to test whether the worms still respond to me?”\n“Work on the Council should not interfere with that.”\n“I... you can see I’m surprised.”\n“| would have said shocked. Tell me, Sheeana, what really interests you these days?”\nStill probing. Trebo, serve me now! “Making sure the desert grows well.” Truth! “And my sex life, of course. You saw the young man on the roof next door? Trebo, a new one Duncan sent me for polishing.”\nEven after Odrade had gone, Sheeana wondered why those words had aroused such merriment. Mother Superior had been deflected, though.\nNo need even to waste her fallback position—truth: “We've been discussing the possibility that | might imprint Teg and restore the Bashar’s memories that way.”\nFull confession avoided. Mother Superior did not learn that | have weaseled out the way to reactivate our no-ship\nprison and defuse the mines Bellonda put in it.\nNo sweeteners will cloak some forms of bitterness. If it tastes bitter, spit it out. That’s what our earliest ancestors did.\n—THE CODA\nurbella found herself arising in the night to continue a\ndream although quite awake and aware of her Surroundings: Duncan asleep beside her, faint ticking of machinery, the chronoprojection on the ceiling. She insisted on Duncan’s presence at night lately, fearful when alone. He blamed the fourth pregnancy.\nShe sat on the edge of the bed. The room was ghostly in the dim light of the chrono. Dream images persisted.\nDuncan grumbled and rolled toward her. An outflung arm draped itself across her legs.\nShe felt that this mental intrusion was not dreamstuff but it had some of those characteristics. Bene Gesserit teachings did this. Them and their damned suggestions about Scytale and... and everything! They precipitated motion she could not control.\nTonight, she was lost\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is the youngest-ever Reverend Mother, a descendant of Siona Atreides, with a Fremen nature and Atreides blood.
