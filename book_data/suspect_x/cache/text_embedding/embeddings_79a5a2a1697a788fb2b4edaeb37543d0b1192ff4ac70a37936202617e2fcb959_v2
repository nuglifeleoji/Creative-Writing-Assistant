Be warned. Understand nothing. All comprehension is temporary.\n—MENTAT FIXE (ADACTO)\ndaho, seated alone at his console, encountered an entry\nhe had stored in Shipsystems during his first days of confinement, and found himself dumped (he applied the word later) into attitudes and sensory awareness of that earlier time. It no longer was afternoon of a frustrating day in the no-ship. He was back there, stretched between then and now the way serial ghola lives linked this incarnation to his original birth.\nImmediately, he saw what he had come to call “the net” and the elderly couple defined by criss-crossed lines, bodies visible through a shimmering of jeweled ropes—green, blue, gold, and a silver so brilliant it made his eyes ache.\nHe sensed godlike stability in these people, but something common about them. The word ordinary came to mind. The by-now-familiar garden landscape stretched out behind them: floral bushes (roses, he thought), rolling lawns, tall trees.\nThe couple stared back at him with an intensity that made Idaho feel naked.\nNew power in the vision! It no longer was confined to the Great Hold, an increasingly compulsive magnet drawing him down there so frequently he knew the watchdogs were alerted.\nIs he another Kwisatz Haderach?\nThere was a level of suspicion the Bene Gesserit could achieve that would kill him if it grew. And they were watching him now! Questions, worried speculations. Despite this, he could not turn away from the vision.\nWhy did that elderly couple look so familiar? Someone from his past? Family?\nMentat riffling of his memories produced nothing to fit the speculation. Round faces. Abbreviated chins. Fat wrinkles at the jowls. Dark eyes. The net obscured their color. The woman wore a long blue and green dress that concealed her feet. A white apron stained with green covered the dress from ample bosom to just below her waist. Garden tools dangled from apron loops. She carried a trowel in her left hand. Her hair was gray. Wisps of it had escaped a confining green scarf and blew around her eyes, emphasizing laughter lines there. She appeared . . . grandmotherly.\nThe man suited her as though created by the same artist as a perfect match. Bib overalls over a mounded stomach. No hat. Those same dark eyes with reflections twinkling in them. A brush of close-cropped wiry gray hair.\nHe had the most benign expression Idaho had ever seen. Upcurved smile creases at the corners of his mouth. He held a small shovel in his left hand, and on his extended right palm he balanced what appeared to be a small metal ball. The ball emitted a piercing whistle that made Idaho clap his hands over his ears. This did not stop the sound. It faded away of itself. He lowered his hands.\nReassuring faces. That thought aroused Idaho’s suspicions because now he recognized the familiarity. They looked somewhat like Face Dancers, even to the pug noses.\nHe leaned forward but the vision kept its distance. “Face Dancers,” he whispered.\nNet and elderly couple vanished.\nThey were replaced by Murbella in practice-floor leotards of glistening ebony. He had to reach out and touch her before he could believe she really stood there.\n“Duncan? What is it? You’re all sweaty.”\n“L... think it’s something the damned Tleilaxu planted in me. | keep seeing... . I think they're Face Dancers. They... they look at me and just now... . a whistle. It hurt.”\nShe glanced up at the comeyes but did not appear worried. This was something the Sisters could know without it presenting immediate dangers . . . except possibly to Scytale.\nShe sank to her haunches beside him and put a hand on his arm. “Something they did to your body in the tanks?”\n“No!”\n“But you said...”\n“My body’s not just a piece of new baggage for this trip. It has all of the chemistry and substance | ever had. It’s my mind that’s different.”\nThat worried her. She knew the Bene Gesserit concern over wild talents. “Damn that Scytale!”\n“I'll find it,” he said.\nHe closed his eyes and heard Murbella stand. Her hand went away from his arm.\n“Maybe you shouldn’t do that, Duncan.”\nShe sounded far away.\nMemory. Where did they hide the secret thing? Deep in the original cells? Until this moment, he had thought of his memory as a Mentat tool. He could call up his own images from long-ago moments in front of mirrors. Close up, examining an age wrinkle. Looking at a woman behind him —two faces in the mirror and his face full of questions.\nFaces. A succession of masks, different views of this person he called myself. Slightly imbalanced faces. Hair sometimes gray, sometimes the jet karakul of his current life. Sometimes humorous, sometimes grave and seeking inward for wisdom to meet a new day. Somewhere in all of that lay a consciousness that observed and deliberated. Someone who made choices. The Tleilaxu had tampered with that.\nIdaho felt his blood pumping hard and knew danger was present. This was what he was intended to experience... but not by the Tleilaxu. He had been born with it.\nThis ts what it means to be alive.\nNo memory from his other lives, nothing the Tleilaxu had done to him, none of that changed his deepest awareness one whit.\nHe opened his eyes. Murbella still stood near but her expression was veiled. So that’s how she will look as a Reverend Mother.\nHe did not like this change in her.\n“What happens if the Bene Gesserit fail?” he asked.\nWhen she did not reply, he nodded. Yes. That’s the worst assumption. The Sisterhood down history’s sewerpipe. And you don’t want that, my beloved.\nHe could see it in her face when she turned and left him.\nLooking up at the comeyes, he said: “Dar. | must talk to you, Dar.”\nNo response from any of the mechanisms around him. He had not expected one. Still, he knew he could talk to her and she would have to listen.\n“I’ve been coming at our problem from the other direction,” he said. And he imagined the busy whirring of recorders as they spun the sounds of his voice into ridulian crystals. “I’ve been getting into the minds of Honored Matres. | know I’ve done it. Murbella resonates.”\nThat would alert them. He had an Honored Matre of his own. But had was not the proper word. He did not have Murbella. Not even in bed. They had each other. Matched the way those people in his vision appeared to be matched. Was that what he saw there? Two older people sexually trained by Honored Matres?\n“I look at another issue now,” he said. “How to overcome the Bene Gesserit.”\nThat threw down the gauntlet.\n“Episodes,” he said. A word Odrade was fond of using.\n“That’s how we have to see what’s happening to us. Little episodes. Even the worst-case assumption has to be screened against that background. The Scattering has a magnitude that dwarfs anything we do.”\nThere! That demonstrated his value to the Sisters. It put Honored Matres in a better perspective. They were back here in the Old Empire. Fellow dwarves. He knew Odrade would see it. Bell would make her see it.\nSomewhere out there in the Infinite Universe, a jury had brought in a verdict against Honored Matres. Law and its managers had not prevailed for the hunters. He suspected that his vision had shown him two of the jurors. And if they were Face Dancers, they were not Scytale’s Face Dancers. Those two people behind the shimmering net belonged to no one but themselves.\nMajor flaws in government arise from a fear of making radical internal changes even though a need is clearly seen.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nor Odrade, the first melange of the morning was always\ndifferent. Her flesh responded like a starveling who clutched at sweet fruit. Then followed the slow, penetrating and painful restoration.\nThis was the fearful thing about melange addiction.\nShe stood at the window of her sleeping chamber waiting for the effect to run its course. Weather Control, she noted, had achieved another morning rain. The landscape was washed clean, everything immersed in a romantic haze, all edges blurred and reduced to essences like old memories. She opened the window. Damp cold air blew across her face, drawing recollections around her the way one put ona familiar garment.\nShe inhaled deeply. Smells after a rain! She remembered the essentials of life amplified and smoothed by falling water but these rains were different. They left a flinty aftersmell she could taste. Odrade did not like it. The message was not of things washed clean but of life resentful, wanting all rain stopped and locked away. This rain no longer gentled and brought fullness. It carried inescapable awareness of change.\nOdrade closed the window. At once, she was back in the familiar odors of her quarters, and that constant smell of shere from the metering implants required of everyone who knew the location of Chapterhouse. She heard Streggi enter, the slip-slip sounds of the desert map being changed.\nAn efficient sound in Streggi’s movements. Weeks of close association had confirmed Odrade’s first judgment. Reliable. Not brilliant but supremely sensitive to Mother Superior’s needs. Look how quietly she moved. Transfer Streggi’s sensitivity to the needs of young Teg and they had his required height and mobility. A horse? Much more.\nOdrade’s melange assimilation reached its peak and subsided. Streggi’s reflection in the window showed her waiting for assignment. She knew these moments were given over to the spice. At her stage, she would be looking forward to the day when she entered this mysterious enhancement.\n| wish her well of it.\nMost Reverend Mothers followed the teaching and seldom thought of their spice as addiction. Odrade knew it every morning for what it was. You took your spice during the day as your body demanded, following a pattern of early training: dosage minimal, just enough to whet the metabolic system and drive it into peak performance. Biological necessities meshed more smoothly with melange. Food tasted better. Barring accident or fatal assault, you lived much longer than you could without it. But you were addicted.\nHer body restored, Odrade blinked and considered Streggi. Curiosity about the morning’s long ritual was plain in her. Speaking to Streggi’s reflection in the window, Odrade said: “Have you learned about melange withdrawal?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior.”\nDespite warnings to keep awareness of addiction low key, it was never more than an eyeblink away from Odrade and she felt the accumulated resentments. Mental preparations as an acolyte (firmly impressed in the Agony) had been eroded by Other Memory and accumulations of time. The admonition: “Withdrawal removes an essential of your life\nand, if it occurs in late middle age, can kill you.” How little that meant now.\n“Withdrawal has intense meaning for me,” Odrade said. “l am one of those for whom the morning melange is painful. I’m sure they told you this happens.”\n“I’m sorry, Mother Superior.”\nOdrade studied the map. It showed a longer finger of desert thrusting northward and a pronounced widening of drylands to the southeast of Central where Sheeana had her station. Presently, Odrade returned her attention to Streggi, who was watching", "\n“Yes, Mother Superior.”\nDespite warnings to keep awareness of addiction low key, it was never more than an eyeblink away from Odrade and she felt the accumulated resentments.

It showed a longer finger of desert thrusting northward and a pronounced widening of drylands to the southeast of Central where Sheeana had her station. Presently, Odrade returned her attention to Streggi, who was watching Mother Superior with new interest.\nBrought up short by thoughts of the spice’s darker side!\n“The uniqueness of melange is seldom considered in our age,” Odrade said. “All of the old narcotics in which humans have indulged possess a remarkable factor in common—all except the spice. They all brought shorter life and pain.”\n“We were told, Mother Superior.”\n“But you probably were not told that a fact of governance could be obscured by our concern with Honored Matres. There’s an energy greed in governments (yes, even in ours) that can dump you into a trap. If you serve me, you will feel it in your guts because every morning you will watch me suffer. Let knowledge of it sink into you, this deadly trap. Don’t become uncaring pushers, caught in a system that displaces life with careless death as Honored Matres do. Remember: Acceptable narcotics can be taxed to pay salaries or otherwise create jobs for uncaring functionaries.”\nStreggi was puzzled. “But melange extends our lives, increases health and arouses appetites for—”\nShe was stopped by Odrade’s scowl.\nRight out of the Acolyte Manual!\n“It has this other side, Streggi, and you see it in me. The Acolyte Manual does not lie. But melange is a narcotic and we are addicted.”\n“I know it’s not gentle with everyone, Mother Superior. But you said Honored Matres don’t use it.”\n“The substitute they employ replaces melange with few benefits except to prevent withdrawal agonies and death. It is parallel addictive.”\n“And the captive?”\n“Murbella used it and now she uses melange. They are interchangeable. Interesting?”\n“I... Suppose we will learn more of this. | notice, Mother Superior, that you never call them whores.”\n“As acolytes do? Ahh, Streggi, Bellonda has been a bad influence. Oh, | recognize the pressures.” As Streggi started to protest. “Acolytes feel the threat. They look at Chapterhouse and think of it as their fortress for the long night of the whores.”\n“Something like that, Mother Superior.” Extremely hesitant.\n“Streggi, this planet is only another temporary place. Today we go south and impress that upon you. Find Tamalane, please, and tell her to make the arrangements we discussed for our visit to Sheeana. Speak to no one else about it.”\n“Yes, Mother Superior. Do you mean | will accompany you?”\n“I want you by my side. Tell the one you are training that she now has full charge of my map.”\nAs Streggi left, Odrade thought of Sheeana and Idaho. She wants to talk to him and he wants to talk to her.\nComeye analysis noted that these two sometimes conversed by hand-signals while hiding most of the movements with their bodies. It had the look of an old Atreides battle language. Odrade recognized some of it but not enough to determine content. Bellonda wanted an explanation from Sheeana. “Secrets!” Odrade was more cautious. “Let it go a bit. Perhaps something interesting will come of it.”\nWhat does Sheeana want?\nWhatever Duncan had in mind it concerned Teg. Creating the pain required for Teg to recover his original memories went against Duncan’s grain.\nOdrade had noted this when she interrupted Duncan at his console yesterday.\n“You're late, Dar.” Not looking up from whatever it was he did there. Late? It was early evening.\nHe had been calling her Dar frequently for several years, a goad, a reminder that he resented his fishtank existence. The goad irritated Bellonda, who argued against “his damned familiarities.” He called Bellonda “Bell,” of course. Duncan was generous with his needle.\nRemembering this, Odrade paused before entering her workroom. Duncan had slammed a fist into the counter beside his console. “There’s got to be a better way for Teg!”\nA better way? What does he have in mind?\nMovement down the corridor beyond the workroom brought her out of this reflection. Streggi returning from Tamalane. Streggi entered the Acolyte Ready Room. Giving the word to her replacement on the desert map.\nA stack of Archival records waited on Odrade’s table. Bellonda! Odrade stared at the pile. No matter how much she tried to delegate there was always this organized residue that her councillors insisted only Mother Superior could handle. Much of this new lot came from Bellonda’s demand for “suggestions and analyses.”\nOdrade touched her console. “Bell!”\nThe voice of an Archives clerk responded: “Mother Superior?”\n“Get Bell up here! | want her in front of me as fast as her fat legs can move!”\nIt was less than a minute. Bellonda stood in front of the worktable like a chastened acolyte. They all knew that tone in Mother Superior’s voice.\nOdrade touched the stack on her table and jerked her hand back as though shocked. “What in the name of Shaitan\nis all of that?”\n“We judged it significant.”\n“You think | have to see everything and anything? Where’s the keynoting? This is sloppy work, Bell! I’m not stupid and neither are you. But this... in the face of this...”\n“| delegate as much as—”\n“Delegate? Look at this! Which must I see and which may | delegate? Not one keynote!”\n“I'll see that it’s corrected immediately.”\n“Indeed you will, Bell. Because Tam and | are going south today, an unannounced inspection tour and a visit with Sheeana. And while I’m gone, you will sit in my chair. See how you like this daily deluge!”\n“Will you be out of touch?”\n“I'll have a lightline and Ear-C at all times.”\nBellonda breathed easier.\n“I suggest, Bell, that you get back to Archives and put someone in charge who will take responsibility. l'm damned if you’re not beginning to act like bureaucrats. Covering your asses!”\n“Real boats rock, Dar.”\nWas that Bell attempting humor? All was not lost!\nOdrade waved a hand over her projector and there was Tamalane in the Transport Hall. “Tam?”\n“Yes?” Without turning from an assignment list.\n“How soon can we leave?”\n“About two hours.”\n“Call me when you're ready. Oh, and Streggi goes with us. Make room for her.” Odrade blanked the projection before Tamalane could respond.\nThere were things she should be doing, Odrade knew. Tam and Bell were not the only sources of Mother Superior’s concerns.\nSixteen planets remaining to us...and that includes Buzzell, definitely a place in peril. Only sixteen! She pushed\nthat thought aside. No time for it.\nMurbella. Should I call her and... No. That can wait. The new Board of Proctors? Let Bell deal with that. Community disbandings?\nSiphoning personnel into a new Scattering had forced consolidations. Staying ahead of the desert! It was depressing and she did not feel she could face it today. /’m always fidgety before a trip.\nAbruptly, Odrade fled the workroom and went stalking the corridors, looking into how her charges were performing, pausing in doorways, noting what the students read, how they behaved in their everlasting prana-bindu exercises.\n“What are you reading there?” demanded of a young second-stage acolyte at a projector in a semi-darkened room.\n“The diaries of Tolstoy, Mother Superior.”\nThat knowing look in the acolyte’s eyes said: “Do you have his words directly in Other Memory?” The question was right there on the edge of the girl’s tongue! They were always trying such petty gambits when they caught her alone.\n“Tolstoy was a family name!” Odrade snapped. “By your mention of diaries, | presume you refer to Count Leo\nNikolayevich.” “Yes, Mother Superior.” Abashedly aware of censure. Softening, Odrade threw a quotation at the girl: “ʻI am not\na river, | am a net.’ He spoke those words at Yasnaya Polyana when he was only twelve. You'll not find them in his diaries but they are probably the most significant words he ever uttered.”\nOdrade turned away before the acolyte could thank her. Always teaching!\nShe wandered down to the main kitchens then and inspected them, tracing inner edges of racked pots for grease, noting the cautious way even the teaching chef observed her progress.\nThe kitchen was steamy with good smells from lunch preparations. There was a restorative sound of chopping and stirring but the usual banter stopped at her entrance.\nShe went around the long counter with its busy cooks to the teaching chef’s raised platform. He was a great beefy man with prominent cheekbones, his face as florid as the meats over which he ministered. Odrade had no doubts he was one of history’s great chefs. His name suited him: Placido Salat. He was assured of a warm place in her thoughts for several reasons, including the fact that he had trained her personal chef. Important visitors in the days before Honored Matres had received a kitchen tour and a taste of specialties.\n“May | introduce our senior chef, Placido Salat?”\nHis beef placido (low case his choice) was the envy of many. Almost raw and served with an herbed and spicy mustard sauce that did not obscure the meat.\nOdrade thought the dish too exotic but never judged it aloud.\nWhen she had Salat’s full attention (after a slight interruption to correct a sauce) Odrade said: “I’m hungry for something special, Placido.”\nHe recognized the opening. This was how she always began a request for her “special dish.”\n“Perhaps an oyster stew,” he suggested.\nIt’s a dance, Odrade thought. They both knew what she wanted.\n“Excellent!” she agreed and went into the required performance. “But it must be treated gently, Placido, the oysters not overcooked. Some of our own powdered dry celery in the broth.”\n“And perhaps a bit of paprika?”\n“I always prefer it that way. Be extremely careful with the melange. A breath of it and no more.”\n“Of course, Mother Superior!” Eyes rolling in horror at the thought he might use too much melange. “So easy for the\nspice to dominate.”\n“Cook the oysters in clam nectar, Placido. | would prefer you watch over them yourself, stirring gently until the edges of the oysters just start to curl.”\n“Not a second longer, Mother Superior.”\n“Heat some quite creamy milk on the side. Don’t boil it!”\nPlacido displayed astonishment that", " oyster stew,” he suggested.\nIt’s a dance, Odrade thought. They both knew what she wanted.\n“Excellent!” she agreed and went into the required performance. “But it must be treated gently, Placido, the oysters not overcooked. Some of our own powdered dry celery in the broth.”\n“And perhaps a bit of paprika?”\n“I always prefer it that way. Be extremely careful with the melange. A breath of it and no more.”\n“Of course, Mother Superior!” Eyes rolling in horror at the thought he might use too much melange. “So easy for the\nspice to dominate.”\n“Cook the oysters in clam nectar, Placido. | would prefer you watch over them yourself, stirring gently until the edges of the oysters just start to curl.”\n“Not a second longer, Mother Superior.”\n“Heat some quite creamy milk on the side. Don’t boil it!”\nPlacido displayed astonishment that she might suspect him of boiling the milk for her oyster stew.\n“A small pat of butter in the serving bowl,” Odrade said. “Pour the combined broth over it.”\n“No sherry?”\n“How glad | am that you are taking personal charge of my special dish, Placido. | forgot the sherry.” (Mother Superior never forgot anything and they all knew it but this was a required step in the dance.)\n“Three ounces of sherry in the cooking broth,” he said.\n“Heat it to get rid of the alcohol.”\n“Of course! But we must not bruise the flavors. Would you like croutons or saltines?”\n“Croutons, please.”\nSeated at an alcove table, Odrade ate two bowls of oyster stew, remembering how Sea Child had savored it. Papa had introduced her to this dish when she was barely capable of conveying spoon to mouth. He had made the stew himself, his own specialty. Odrade had taught it to Salat.\nShe complimented Salat on the wine.\n“| particularly enjoyed your choice of a chablis for accompaniment.”\n“A flinty chablis with a sharp edge on it, Mother Superior. One of our better vintages. It sets off the oyster flavors admirably.”\nTamalane found her in the alcove. They always knew where to find Mother Superior when they wanted her.\n“We are ready.” Was that displeasure on Tam’s face?\n“Where will we stop tonight?”\n“Eldio.”\nOdrade smiled. She liked Eldio.\nTam catering to me because I’m in a critical mood? Perhaps we have the makings of a small diversion.\nFollowing Tamalane to the transport docks, Odrade thought how characteristic it was that the older woman preferred to travel by tube. Surface trips annoyed her. “Who wants to waste time at my age?”\nOdrade disliked tubes for personal transport. You were so closed in and helpless! She preferred surface or air and used tubes only when speed was urgent. She had no hesitation about using smaller tubes for chits and notes. Notes don’t care just as long as they get there.\nThis thought always made her conscious of the network that adjusted to her movements wherever she went.\nSomewhere in the heart of things (there was always a “heart of things”) an automated system routed communications and made sure (most of the time) that important missives arrived where addressed.\nWhen Private Dispatch (they all called it PD) was not needed, stat or viz was available along scrambled sorters and lightlines. Off-planet was another matter, especially in these hunted times. Safest to send a Reverend Mother with memorized message or distrans implant. Every messenger took heavier doses of shere these days. T-probes could read even a dead mind not guarded by shere. Every off-planet message was encrypted but an enemy might hit on the one- time cover concealing it. Great risk off-planet. Perhaps that was why the Rabbi remained silent.\nNow why am I thinking such things at this moment?\n“No word yet from Dortujla?” she asked as Tamalane prepared to enter the Dispatch roundelay where the others in their party waited. So many people. Why so many?\nOdrade saw Streggi up ahead at the edge of the dock talking to a Communications acolyte. There were at least six other people from Communications nearby.\nTamalane turned in obvious pique. “Dortujla! We have all said we will notify you the instant we hear!”\n“I was just asking, Tam. Just asking.”\nMeekly, Odrade followed Tamalane into Dispatch. / should put a monitor on my mind and question everything that rises there. Mental intrusions always had good reason behind them. That was the Bene Gesserit way, as Bellonda often reminded her.\nOdrade felt surprise at herself then, realizing she was more than a little sick of Bene Gesserit ways.\nLet Bell worry about such things for a change!\nThis was a time for floating free, for responding like a will o’ the wisp to the currents moving around her.\nSea Child knew about currents.\nTime does not count itself. You have only to look at a circle and this is apparent.\n—LETO II (THE TYRANT)\nfd Fas Look what we have come to!” the Rabbi wailed.\nHe sat cross-legged on the cold curved floor with his Shawl pulled up over his head and almost concealing his face.\nThe room around him was gloomy and resonating with Small machinery sounds that made him feel weak. If those sounds should stop!\nRebecca stood in front of him, hands on her hips, a look of weary frustration on her face.\n“Do not stand there like that!” the Rabbi commanded. He peered up at her from beneath the shawl.\n“If you despair, then are we not lost?” she asked.\nThe sound of her voice angered him and he was a moment putting this unwanted emotion aside.\nShe dares to instruct me? But was it not said by wiser men that knowledge can come from a weed? A great shuddering sigh shook him and he dropped the shawl to his shoulders. Rebecca helped him stand.\n“A no-chamber,” the Rabbi muttered. “In here, we hide from...” His gaze searched upward at a dark ceiling. “Better left unspoken even here.”\n“We hide from the unspeakable,” Rebecca said.\n“The door cannot even be left open at Passover,” he said. “How will the Stranger enter?”\n“Some strangers we do not want,” she said.\n“Rebecca.” He bowed his head. “You are more than a trial and a problem. This little cell of Secret Israel shares your exile because we understand that—”\n“Stop saying that! You understand nothing of what has happened to me. My problem?” She leaned close to him. “It is to remain human while in contact with all of those past lives.”\nThe Rabbi recoiled.\n“So you are no longer one of us? Are you a Bene Gesserit then?”\n“You will know when I’m Bene Gesserit. You will see me looking at myself as | look at myself.”\nHis brows drew down in a scowl. “What are you saying?”\n“What does a mirror look at, Rabbi?”\n“Hmmmmph! Riddles now.” But a faint smile twitched at his mouth. A look of determination returned to his eyes. He stared around him at the room. There were eight of them here—more than this space should hold. A no-chamber! It had been assembled painstakingly with smuggled bits and pieces. So small. Twelve and a half meters long. He had measured it himself. A shape like an ancient barrel laid on its side, oval in cross section and with half-globe closures at the ends. The ceiling was no more than a meter above his head. The widest point here at the center was only five meters and the curve of floor and ceiling made it seem even narrower. Dried food and recycled water. That was what they must live on and for how long? One SY maybe if they were not found. He did not trust the security of this device. Those peculiar sounds in the machinery.\nIt had been late in the day when they crept into this hole. Darkness up there now for sure. And where were the rest of his people? Fled to whatever sanctuary they could find, drawing on old debts and honorable commitments for past services. Some would survive. Perhaps they would survive better than this remnant in here.\nThe entrance to the no-chamber lay concealed beneath an ash pit with a free-standing chimney beside it. The reinforcing metal of the chimney contained threads of ridulian crystal to relay exterior scenes into this place. Ashes! The room still smelled of burned things and it already had begun to take on a sewer stink from the small recycling chamber. What a euphemism for a toilet!\nSomeone came up behind the Rabbi. “The searchers are leaving. Lucky we were warned in time.”\nIt was Joshua, the one who had built this chamber. He was a short, slender man with a sharply triangular face narrowing to a thin chin. Dark hair swept over his broad forehead. He had widely spaced brown eyes that looked out at his world with a brooding inwardness the Rabbi did not trust. He looks too young to know so much about these things.\n“So they are leaving,” the Rabbi said. “They will be back. You will not think us lucky then.”\n“They will not guess we hid so near the farm,” Rebecca said. “The searchers were mostly looting.”\n“Listen to the Bene Gesserit,” the Rabbi said.\n“Rabbi.” What a chiding sound in Joshua’s voice! “Have | not heard you say many times that the blessed ones are they who hide the flaws of others even from themselves?”\n“Everybody’s a teacher now!” the Rabbi said. “But who can tell us what will happen next?”\nHe had to admit the truth of Joshua’s words, though. /t is the anguish of our flight that troubles me. Our little diaspora. But we do not scatter from Babylon. We hide in a...acyclone cellar!\nThis thought restored him. Cyclones pass.\n“Who is in charge of the food?” he asked. “We must ration ourselves from the start.”\nRebecca heaved a sigh of relief. The Rabbi was at his worst in the wide oscillations—too emotional or too intellectual. He had himself in hand once more. He would\nbecome intellectual next. That would have to be dampened, too. Bene Gesserit awareness gave her a new view of the people around her. Our Jewish susceptibility. Look at the intellectuals!\nIt was a thought peculiar to the Sisterhood. The drawbacks of anyone placing considerable reliance on intellectual achievements were large. She could not deny all of that evidence from the Lampadas horde. Speaker paraded it for her whenever she wavered.\nRebecca had come almost to enjoy the pursuit of memory fancies, as she thought of them. Knowing earlier times forced her to deny her own earlier times. She had been required to believe so many things she now knew were nonsense. Myths and chimera, impulses of extremely childish behavior.\n“Our gods should mature as we mature.”\nRebecca suppressed a smile. Speaker did that to her often —a little nudge in the ribs from someone who knew you would appreciate it.\nJoshua had gone back to his instruments. She saw that someone was reviewing the catalogue of food stores. The Rabbi watched this with his normal intensity. Others had rolled themselves into blankets and were sleeping on the cots in the darkened end of the chamber. Seeing all of this, Rebecca knew what her function must be. Keep us from boredom.\n“The games master?”\nUnless you have something better to suggest, don’t try to tell me about my own people, Speaker.\nWhatever else she might say about these inner conversations, there was no doubt that all of the pieces were connected—the past with this room, this room with her projections"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_79a5a2a1697a788fb2b4edaeb37543d0b1192ff4ac70a37936202617e2fcb959_v2"}
