She looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand.\n“You look a mess,” he said.\n“You're not so pretty yourself,” she said.\nThey started to laugh, then sobered.\n“That shouldn’t have happened,” Paul said. “I was careless.”\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.\n“I'll put up the tent,” he said. “Better slip off that robe and shake it out.” He turned away, taking the pack.\nJessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.\n“There’s anchor holes in the rock,” Paul said. “Someone's tented here before.”\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place—deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away—far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.\nShe turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere blending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the oil lenses on the other cliff, lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand.\nJessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons.\n“There are growing things over there,” he said.\nJessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul.\n“There,” he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other.\nShe looked where he pointed.\n“Saguaro,” she said. “Scrawny stuff.”\n“There may be people nearby,” Paul said.\n“That could be the remains of a botanical testing Station,” she warned.\n“This is pretty far south into the desert,” he said. He lowered his binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. “This has the feeling of a Fremen place,” he said.\n“Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?” she asked.\n“Kynes promised their help.”\nBut there’s desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. / felt some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.\nShe closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan—she and the Duke Leto, before Paul’s birth. They’d flown over the southern jungles, above the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery—man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder\npoles. And in the sea reaches there’d been the white petals of trimaran dhows.\nAll of it gone.\nJessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass.\nA spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sand-fall was gone, she still heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.\n“Worm,” Paul whispered.\nIt came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored. A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of vision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then it was gone, coursing off to the left.\nThe sound diminished, died.\n“I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,” Paul whispered.\nShe nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of Skyline.\n“When we've rested,” Jessica said, “we should continue with your lessons.”\nHe suppressed a sudden anger, said: “Mother, don’t you think we could do without....”\n“Today you panicked,” she said. “You know your mind and bindu-nervature perhaps better than I do, but you’ve much yet to learn about your body’s prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and | can teach you about this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body. You need review of the hands. We'll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and tip sensitivity.” She turned away. “Come, into the tent, now.”\nHe flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination...that he must agree.\nWhatever has been done to me, I’ve been a party to it, he thought.\nReview of the hand!\nHe looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.\nWe came from Caladan—a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind—we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life—we went soft, we lost our edge.\n—FROM “MUAD'DIB: CONVERSATIONS” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad S o you're the great Gurney Halleck,” the man Said.\nHalleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes that told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space frigate’s master control center—communications and viewscreens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk formed as a wall projection—part of the remaining curve.\n“I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek,” the Smuggler said.\n“Then you're the one | owe thanks for the help we've received,” Halleck said.\n“Ah-h-h, gratitude,” the smuggler said. “Sit down.”\nA ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler\nand scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.\nHalleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family resemblance in the smuggler now —the father’s heavy, overhanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose.\n“Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens,” Halleck said.\n“By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people,” Tuek said.\nAnger overcame part of Halleck’s fatigue. He straightened, said: “Can you name the traitor?”\n“We are not sure.”\n“Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.”\n“Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch...perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive.”\n“I heard.” Halleck took a deep breath. “It appears we've a deal more killing ahead of us.”\n“We will do nothing to attract attention to us,” Tuek said.\nHalleck stiffened. “But—”\n“You and those of your men we’ve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,” Tuek said. “You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can always use good men. We'll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the slightest open move against the Harkonnens.”\n“But they killed your father, man!”\n“Perhaps. And if so, l'Il give you my father’s answer to those who act without thinking: ‘A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool’s wrath Is heavier than them both.’”\n“You mean to do nothing about it, then?” Halleck sneered.\n“You did not hear me say that. | merely say | will protect our contract with the Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other ways of destroying a foe.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h.”\n“Ah, indeed. If you’ve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But | warn you that you’re probably too late...and we doubt she’s the one you want, anyway.”\n“Hawat made few mistakes.”\n“He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.”\n“You think he’s the traitor?”\nTuek shrugged. “This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the Harkonnens believe it.”\n“You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.”\n“Hints and suggestions...rumors and hunches.”\n“We are seventy-four men,” Halleck said. “If you seriously wish us to enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead.”\n“His body has been seen.”\n“And the boy, too—young Master Paul?” Halleck tried to swallow, found a lump in his throat.\n“According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found.”\n“So the witch is dead then...all dead.”\nTuek nodded. “And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune.”\n“The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?”\n“Yes.”\nIt took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him. He spoke with panting breath: “I’ve a score of my own against Rabban. | owe him for the lives of my family....” He rubbed at the scar along his jaw. “...and for this....”\n“One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely,” Tuek said. He frowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck’s jaw, the sudden withdrawal in the man’s shed-lidded eyes.\n“I know...| know.” Halleck took a deep breath.\n“You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us. There are many places to\n“I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With Rabban here—|I stay.”\n“In your mood, I’m not sure we want you to stay.”\nHalleck stared at the smuggler. “You doubt my word?”\n“NO-O-0....”\n“You’ve saved me from the Harkonnens. | gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no greater reason. III stay on Arrakis—with you...or with the Fremen.”\n“Whether a thought is spoken or not it Is a real thing and it has power,” Tuek said. “You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.”\nHalleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him. “Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?” he murmured.\n“Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,” Tuek said. “Speed is a device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart—water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.”\nHalleck opened his eyes. “I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”\n“I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e2984f42bebb824686008a88a3c8ba2c7d3b173193813d692d5eb00d67286e26_v2"}
