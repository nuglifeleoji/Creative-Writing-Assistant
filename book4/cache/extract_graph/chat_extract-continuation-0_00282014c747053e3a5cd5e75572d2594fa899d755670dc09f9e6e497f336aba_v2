\n　　淑芳马上对大哥和嫂子说：“三锤作文太差，少平很关心他，专门到咱家给他辅导来了！” \n　　金光亮夫妇听弟媳妇这么一说，才明白了过来。夫妻俩立刻忙乱起来。尽管他们对孙家的人有一种别扭情绪，但还是热情欢迎“敌方”来的这位友好使者。光亮先用大碗给孙老师泡了一碗茶水；他老婆忙着到锅上给孙老师炒南瓜籽去了。 \n　　淑芳和三锤引着少平来到他们家的中窑。少平便开始给三锤讲解如何写记叙文。金光亮看少平如此认真地点化他的儿子，便在旁边虔诚地拨弄着照明的煤油灯。他不时惊讶地张开嘴巴，打量着孙玉厚家的这个二小子；除过内心为这小伙子的大度行为大受震动以外，同时还不断揣摸思量；孙家的这小子为什么要这样？是他自己作主来他们家，还是受大人的唆使来给他们设什么圈套？ \n　　不用说，当这件事在村子里传开以后，人们在惊讶之余，很是议论了一阵子。当然，对此最为恼火的是孙玉亭。他几次找到侄儿，埋怨他竟然丧失阶级立场，跑到金光亮家帮助地主的孙子学文化去了！ \n　　孙少平对二爸说：“我的事你不要管！” \n　　玉亭对侄儿的态度大吃一惊。他这才发现，侄儿已经再不是个毛头小子了！他同时还隐约地意识到，他不论是作为长辈或者领导人的权威，已经受到了下一代的严重挑战。他觉得，他还是他，但世事似乎已经发生了某些令他不解的变化…… \n　　在阳历年前的一天，田晓霞象她说过的那样，如期地回到了双水村。 \n　　她到了大爹家的当天，就让润生把少平叫来了。田福堂两口子都为弟弟的这位千金到来而高兴，他们忙碌地为侄女备办乡下的稀罕吃食。而田晓霞却在另外一孔窑洞里，和少平天南海北谈了个热火。润生才学平庸，插不上多少话，只是似懂非懂地在一边认真听他俩说。 \n　　在晓霞和田福堂一家人的热情挽留下，少平在润生家里吃了一顿午饭。吃完饭后，他和润生又带着晓霞到山上转了一下午。城里长大的田晓霞，对山野里的一切都感到新鲜和激动。因为跟着个呆板的润生，他们也没放开乐。要是把润生换成金波，那他们一定会忘情地疯一疯的。 \n　　第二天，少平给家里人打招呼说，他要请晓霞到他们家来吃饭。
