\n　　至于队里的事，那就更多了。冬小麦已经返青，需要除草和施肥，尿素和硫酸铵比较简单，撒在地里就行了，但碳酸铵要用土埋住，否则肥效发挥不了作用。需要好好把这些事安顿给副队长田福高，不敢让社员应应付付了事。另外，还要赶紧开始种黑豆和小日月玉米……直到他坐在过路回家的金波父亲的汽车上往县城去的时候，还觉得有许多事没有安排妥当……现在，他已经到润叶的宿舍里了。 \n　　这是他头一次到城里单位来找她。尽管是老熟人，总还觉得有些拘束。 \n　　润叶已经给他打好了一盆洗脸水，水盆里泡了一条雪白的毛巾。 \n　　他犹豫地笑笑，说：“我不洗了……” \n　　“快洗！坐了半天车，洗洗脸清朗！”润叶命令他说。“这么白的毛巾，我一次就给你洗黑了。”他只好走到脸盆前。 \n　　“你看你！这有个什么哩！黑了我再洗嘛！干脆，让我再提些水，你把头也洗一下！” \n　　“不了，不了。”少安一边洗脸，赴忙拒绝让他洗头。他的头在这点脸盆里能洗干净吗？ \n　　少安洗完脸后，润叶立刻说：“走，咱们到街上食堂吃饭去！” \n　　“我已经吃过了。” \n　　“你大概早上吃过了！” \n　　少安不好意思地笑了。她太熟悉他了，什么事也别想瞒她。 \n　　他们一块相跟着往街上走。少安现在才发现润叶身上有些变化，似乎一下子老成多了。他半天才留意到润叶已经不梳辫子，变成了剪发头。这倒使他感到对她有点陌生。是的，随着光阴荏苒，每个人都在变化。这又一次使他强烈地感到，他们的童年早已经流逝，两个人都成大人了。不知为什么，他猛然间又记起了那时候她给他补破裤子的情形，便忍不住“嘿嘿”地笑出了声。 \n　　“少安哥，你笑什么哩？”走在旁边的润叶问他。她白净的脸蛋上泛出兴奋的红晕，腼腆地微笑着。 \n　　“没什么……”他的脸也热烘烘的。 \n　　少安和润叶走在一起，就象他有时引着兰香在山里劳动一样，心中充满了亲切的兄妹感情。真的，他看待润叶就象看待自己的亲妹妹一样。人活着，这种亲人之间的感情是多么重要，即使人的一生充满了坎坷和艰辛，只要有这种感情存在，也会感到一种温暖的慰藉。假如没有这种感情，我们活在这世界上会有多么悲哀啊……他跟着润叶进了县城最大的国营食堂。午饭时间已经过了，食堂\n######################\nOutput:",
