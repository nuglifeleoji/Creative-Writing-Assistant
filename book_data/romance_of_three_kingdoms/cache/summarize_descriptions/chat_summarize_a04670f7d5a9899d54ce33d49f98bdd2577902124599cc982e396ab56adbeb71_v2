He was the son of 刘备 and 甘夫人, born during a pivotal time that marked the continuation of 刘备's legacy. As the designated heir of the先主, 刘禅 was expected to assume leadership after his father's death.\n\nThroughout his reign, 刘禅 demonstrated a tendency towards indulgence and often depended heavily on his advisor 黄皓. This reliance on advisors shaped his leadership style and decision-making processes. Notably, he sent a messenger to congratulate after the execution of 孙綝, indicating his engagement in the political dynamics of the time.\n\n刘禅 is recognized as the last emperor of the Shu Han state, a role that came with significant challenges as the Three Kingdoms period was marked by political strife and military conflicts. His reign is characterized by a blend of inherited authority and the complexities of governance during a tumultuous era. Despite his lineage and the expectations placed upon him, 刘禅's leadership is often viewed through the lens of his dependence on others, which ultimately influenced the fate of Shu Han.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898685, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 568, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
