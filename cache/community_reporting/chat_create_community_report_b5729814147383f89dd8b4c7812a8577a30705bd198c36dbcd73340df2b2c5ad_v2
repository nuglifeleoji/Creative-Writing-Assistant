Located in the Sareer on Arrakis, it is a massive, fortified structure featuring towers, advanced Ixian technology, and extensive underground catacombs housing Fish Speaker facilities, melange hoards, and hidden secrets. The Citadel functions as a hub for political, military, and historical affairs, where Leto holds court, conducts state business, and meets with key figures like Duncan Idaho and Siona.  \n\nIt is a secure stronghold where Leto stores valuable resources, including vast spice reserves, and where damaged items—such as his canopy—are repaired. The Citadel also serves as an archive, preserving records of Leto’s transformation and the empire’s history. Significant events unfold here, from strategic discussions between Leto and Idaho to confrontations with rebels like Siona, who once stole plans or items from the fortress. The Fish Speakers operate within its corridors, overseeing detainees like Siona and escorting figures such as Idaho to and from locations like Tuono Village or Goygoa.  \n\nAt times, the Citadel is a focal point of conflict, whether as the Honored Matres' last stand at Junction or the starting point for desert journeys. Despite its impregnable reputation, it remains a center of intrigue, with rebels targeting its secrets and Leto’s courtiers departing for missions. The Citadel’s perimeter is routinely inspected, reinforcing its status as the God Emperor’s unassailable bastion and the symbolic core of his rule.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",14\n1457,TOWER,\"Leto's tower is his residence and observation point, featuring an aerie and a balcony with a view of the surrounding land.\"\"\",3\n1243,SARER,\"**Summary of the Sareer:**  \n\nThe **Sareer** is a vast, barren desert region on **Arrakis (Dune)**, serving as the last remnant of the planet's once-dominant deserts. It is a place of extreme desolation, characterized by scorching heat, mirages, and a fluid horizon, symbolizing both the harshness of the landscape and the transformative nature of the events that unfold within it. The Sareer is closely associated with **Leto II, the God Emperor**, who rules over it as his sanctuary and testing ground.  \n\nLocated near **Leto’s Citadel**, the Sareer is enclosed by high cliffs, ridges, and man-made barriers, including a massive wall constructed from materials taken from a former mountain named after **Duncan Idaho**. The region is strategically significant, functioning as a controlled environment where weather patterns—such as rare rainfall at its edges—are regulated by satellite controllers. Despite its aridity, cool air is drawn into the Citadel from the desert, sustaining the fortress.  \n\nThe Sareer holds deep personal and political importance. It is a place of **memory and testing**, where Leto and his followers, including **Siona Atreides**, undergo pivotal experiences. Siona, in particular, is tested here as part of her preparation for leadership. The desert also contrasts sharply with the lush landscapes observed elsewhere on Arrakis, emphasizing its role as a relic of the planet’s past.  \n\nGeographically, the Sareer lies opposite **the Wall**, where Idaho peers down, and is bordered by the **Idaho River**. It is home to **Tabur Village** and serves as the last refuge for those fleeing the Citadel, including the runners who escape its confines. The region is frequently referenced in **charts studied by Idaho and Leto**, reinforcing its centrality to the empire’s governance.  \n\nIn summary, the **Sareer** is more than just a desert—it is a **symbol of Leto’s rule**, a **testing ground for survival and leadership**, and the **last vestige of Arrakis’s ancient identity**. Its stark, unforgiving landscape mirrors the challenges faced by those who navigate its sands, making it a cornerstone of the narrative’s setting and themes.\",10\n1266,DISPLAY SIETCH,\"**Display Sietch** is a recreated Fremen cave village located in the Sareer region, designed to showcase traditional Fremen culture and way of life.
