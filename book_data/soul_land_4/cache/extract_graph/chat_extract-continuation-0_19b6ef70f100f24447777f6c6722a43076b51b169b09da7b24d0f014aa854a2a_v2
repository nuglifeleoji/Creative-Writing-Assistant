的残骸在它爆发后的51小时开始辐射电脉冲时，太阳系所接收到的能量是巨大的，而地球，就淹没在这能量的海洋中。这种能量是以电磁脉冲形式出现的，脉冲的每秒钟出现54次，所以，地球表层空间里充满了频率为54赫兹的强大的交变磁场，世界电力网的所有线路均处于这个交变磁场中，所以感应出了强大的交流电。电流感应主要发生在较长的高压输电线上，经各级变电系统变换后输送到世界的每一个角落。有很多变电系统烧毁了，但大部分都适应了超新星送来的电流，重新驱动了这个世界。强大的电流向所有的发电厂反送，把这些人类在过去百年间建成并赖以生存的能源设施大部分烧毁了。但这实在算不上什么损失，以后的世界再也用不着发电机了，只要架设一条足够长的线路，就可直接从空间取得电能。死星杀死了地球上三分之二的人，却给以后的人类带来了无尽的能源。\n　　但这充满空间的强大交变磁场也带来了很大的问题，虽然这些问题与它带给人类的利益相比微不足道，也足以让孩子们头疼很多年。比如铁路，同高压输电线一样是很长的感应体，在1999A的电磁脉冲到来之时，铁轨立刻变成两条携带着强电流的导线，铁轨接头处迸出的电火花使漫长的铁路线变成一条望不到头的火龙，在各个车站中，通入强电流的内燃机车相继起火爆炸……当两个孩子走近透明屏幕向外看去时，这场由超新星奏起的宇宙交响乐最后一个，也是最壮丽的一个乐章出现了：在两天前超新星爆发的那片空间，出现了一片巨大的发光星云！这是超新星爆发后留下的尘埃，这尘埃在1999A 出现后就已存在，但直到现在1999A的残骸发出的高能电脉冲激发了它，使其在可见光波长发出同步加速辐射，人类才能看到它。这个突然出现在宇宙中的大星云呈放射状，形状像一朵玫瑰花，以后人们就把它称为玫瑰星云。它十分巨大，一端在半空中，另一端已接近地平线。玫瑰星云在苍穹中发出庄严而神秘的蓝光，这光芒照到大地上后就变成月光那样的银色，但有两个满月那样亮，照亮了雨后大地上的每一个细节，使下面城市的灯海暗淡了许多。\n　　两个孩子站在这座A型建筑高高的顶端，凝视着宇宙中发着蓝光的大星云，这是古老恒星庄严的坟墓和孕育着新恒星的壮丽的胚胎。两个小身躯被镀上了一层梦幻般的银光。\n　　从此，玫瑰星云将照耀着人类历史，直至这个继恐龙之后用智慧统治地球的物种毁灭或永生。\n　　玫瑰星云很快达\n######################\nOutput:",
