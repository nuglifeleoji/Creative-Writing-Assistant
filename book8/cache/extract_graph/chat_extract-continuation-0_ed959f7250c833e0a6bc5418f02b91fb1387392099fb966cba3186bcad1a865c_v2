“吼——”吞马暴怒大吼，三枚冰球在空中瞬间被震碎成齑粉，然后它那硕大的身躯就从河里站了起来，张着血盆大口就朝着三头幽冥狼冲了过去。\n\n    “嗷嗷嗷！”巨大的声浪带着气流吹的三头幽冥狼就地翻滚，恐惧的尖叫声中，夹着尾巴掉头就跑。\n\n    如果它们会说话，此时一定很想大喊一声：冤枉啊！\n\n    吞马虽然体型庞大、行动缓慢，但它能够被大多数食肉魂兽放过除了皮糙肉厚之外，肯定也有着它足以威慑的一面。\n\n    吞马本身是吃草的，但急了也一样能吃肉。天赋技能吞噬，拥有恐怖的吞吸之力。那巨大的大嘴张开，一口就能吃掉半头幽冥狼毫无问题。它一发怒，顿时吓得三头幽冥狼屁滚尿流。\n\n    蓝轩宇落在河的另一边，呼吸有些急促，小脸微红，眼中的惊惧之色并未减退，但看着三头幽冥狼就这么跑了，这才大大的松了口气，背后的衣襟却已经被汗水浸透了。\n\n    果然好危险啊这里！\n\n    紫萝分院体育馆。\n\n    众位本院老师面面相觑，就连牧重天心中都是极其震惊的。\n\n    驱马吞狼？这是一个年仅八岁的孩童能够做到的？尤其是蓝轩宇那冰球的控制，可谓妙到毫颠。最后三个带有回旋之力的冰球可以说是决定性的，祸水东引，借助吞马之力吓跑了幽冥狼。\n\n    无论是应变速度、反应速度再加上自身对于武魂的控制力，都是可圈可点。简直可以说是教科书一般的应对方式啊！\n\n    牧重天一拍大腿，“这孩子要了。”\n------------\n\n第六十八章 三眼魔猿\n\n    他们选的就是天才，毫无疑问，蓝轩宇绝对符合天才的一切特质。\n\n    “现在把他弄出来吗？”坐在屏幕前的老师问道，他们又何尝不是惊艳呢？考核的学校紫萝分院当然不是第一个，他们这次考核，几乎覆盖了天罗星多座分院，但一下就能让人眼前一亮的孩子可不多啊！蓝轩宇刚刚的表现，虽然武魂没有多强，可他的反应、应变还有对于局面的判断，无不妙到毫颠。就算是成年魂师遇到这种情况恐怕都很难有他处理的这么好了。\n\n    这怎能不让人感到惊喜呢？\n\n    “继续，看看他还能做到多少。这对他来说也是一次历练。”\n\n    蓝轩宇这会儿的反应还是挺大的，这是他第一次面对魂兽，虽然吓跑了三头幽冥狼，可他自己也被吓得够�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>吞马<|>PERSON<|>吞马
