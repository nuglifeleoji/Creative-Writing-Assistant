Terror swept over him.\nPaul jerked upright on his pallet, eyes wide open, staring. Part of him looked outward, part inward. Outwardly, he saw the plasmeld grillwork which vented his private room, and he knew he lay beside a stonelike abyss of his Keep. Inwardly, he continued to see the moon fall.\nOut! Out!\nHis grillwork of plasmeld looked onto the blazing light of noon across Arrakeen. Inward—there lay blackest night. A shower of sweet odors from a garden roof nibbled at his senses, but no floral perfume could roll back that fallen moon.\nPaul swung his feet to the cold surface of the floor, peered through the grillwork. He could see directly across to the gentle arc of a footbridge constructed of crystal- stabilized gold and platinum. Fire jewels from far Cedon\ndecorated the bridge. It led to the galleries of the inner city across a pool and fountain filled with waterflowers. If he stood, Paul knew, he could look down into petals as clean and red as fresh blood whirling, turning there—disks of ambient color tossed on an emerald freshet.\nHis eyes absorbed the scene without pulling him from spice thralldom.\nThat terrible vision of a lost moon.\nThe vision suggested a monstrous loss of individual security. Perhaps he’d seen his civilization fall, toppled by its own pretensions.\nAmoon...amoon...a falling moon.\nIt had taken a massive dose of the spice essence to penetrate the mud thrown up by the tarot. All it had shown him was a falling moon and the hateful way he’d known from the beginning. To buy an end for the Jihad, to silence the volcano of butchery, he must discredit himself.\nDisengage... disengage... disengage...\nFloral perfume from the garden roof reminded him of Chani. He longed for her arms now, for the clinging arms of love and forgetfulness. But even Chani could not exorcise this vision. What would Chani say if he went to her with the statement that he had a particular death in mind? Knowing it to be inevitable, why not choose an aristocrat’s death, ending life on a secret flourish, squandering any years that might have been? To die before coming to the end of willpower, was that not an aristocrat’s choice?\nHe stood, crossed to the lapped opening in the grillwork, went out onto a balcony which looked upward to flowers and vines trailing from the garden. His mouth held the dryness of a desert march.\nMoon... moon—where is that moon?\nHe thought of Alia’s description, the young woman’s body found in the dunes. A Fremen addicted to semuta! Everything fitted the hateful pattern.\nYou do not take from this universe, he thought. /t grants what it will.\nThe remains of a conch shell from the seas of Mother Earth lay on a low table beside the balcony rail. He took its lustrous smoothness into his hands, tried to feel backward in Time. The pearl surface reflected glittering moons of light. He tore his gaze from it, peered upward past the garden to a sky become a conflagration—trails of rainbow dust shining in the silver sun.\nMy Fremen call themselves “Children of the Moon,” he thought.\nHe put down the conch, strode along the balcony. Did that terrifying moon hold out hope of escape? He probed for meaning in the region of mystic communion. He felt weak, Shaken, still gripped by the spice.\nAt the north end of his plasmeld chasm, he came in sight of the lower buildings of the government warren. Foot traffic thronged the roof walks. He felt that the people moved there like a frieze against a background of doors, walls, tile designs. The people were tiles! When he blinked, he could hold them frozen in his mind. A frieze.\nA moon falls and is gone.\nA feeling came over him that the city out there had been translated into an odd symbol for his universe. The buildings he could see had been erected on the plain where his Fremen had obliterated the Sardaukar legions. Ground once trampled by battles rang now to the rushing clamor of business.\nKeeping to the balcony’s outer edge, Paul strode around the corner. Now, his vista was a suburb where city structures lost themselves in rocks and the blowing sand of the desert. Alia’s temple dominated the foreground; green and black hangings along its two-thousand-meter sides displayed the moon symbol of Muad’Dib.\nA falling moon.\nPaul passed a hand across his forehead and eyes. The symbol-metropolis oppressed him. He despised his own thoughts. Such vacillation in another would have aroused his anger.\nHe loathed his city!\nRage rooted in boredom flickered and simmered deep within him, nurtured by decisions that couldn’t be avoided. He knew which path his feet must follow. He’d seen it enough times, hadn’t he? Seen it! Once... long ago, he’d thought of himself as an inventor of government. But the invention had fallen into old patterns. It was like some hideous contrivance with plastic memory. Shape it any way you wanted, but relax for a moment, and it snapped into the ancient forms. Forces at work beyond his reach in human breasts eluded and defied him.\nPaul stared out across the rooftops. What treasures of untrammeled life lay beneath those roofs? He glimpsed leaf- green places, open plantings amidst the chalk-red and gold of the roofs. Green, the gift of Muad’Dib and his water. Orchards and groves lay within his view—open plantings to rival those of fabled Lebanon.\n“Muad’Dib spends water like a madman,” Fremen said.\nPaul put his hands over his eyes.\nThe moon fell.\nHe dropped his hands, stared at his metropolis with Clarified vision. Buildings took on an aura of monstrous imperial barbarity. They stood enormous and bright beneath the northern sun. Colossi! Every extravagance of architecture a demented history could produce lay within his view: terraces of mesa proportion, squares as large as some cities, parks, premises, bits of cultured wilderness.\nSuperb artistry abutted inexplicable prodigies of dismal tastelessness. Details impressed themselves upon him: a postern out of most ancient Baghdad... a dome dreamed in mythical Damascus... an arch from the low gravity of\nAtar . .. harmonious elevations and queer depths. All created an effect of unrivaled magnificence.\nA moon! A moon! A moon!\nFrustration tangled him. He felt the pressure of mass- unconscious, that burgeoning sweep of humankind across his universe. They rushed upon him with a force like a gigantic tidal bore. He sensed the vast migrations at work in human affairs: eddies, currents, gene flows. No dams of abstinence, no seizures of impotence nor maledictions could stop it.\nMuad’Dib’s Jihad was less than an eye-blink in this larger movement. The Bene Gesserit swimming in this tide, that corporate entity trading in genes, was trapped in the torrent as he was. Visions of a falling moon must be measured against other legends, other visions in a universe where even the seemingly eternal stars waned, flickered, died...\nWhat mattered a single moon in such a universe?\nFar within his fortress citadel, so deep within that the sound sometimes lost itself in the flow of city noises, a ten- string rebaba tinkled with a song of the Jihad, a lament for a woman left behind on Arrakis:\nHer hips are dunes curved by the wind, Her eyes shine like summer heat.\nTwo braids of hair hang down her back— Rich with water rings, her hair!\nMy hands remember her skin,\nFragrant as amber, flower-scented. Eyelids tremble with memories...\n| am stricken by love’s white flame!\nThe song sickened him. A tune for stupid creatures lost in sentimentality! As well sing to the dune-impregnated corpse Alia had seen.\nA figure moved in shadows of the balcony’s grillwork. Paul whirled.\nThe ghola emerged into the sun’s full glare. His metal eyes glittered.\n“Is it Duncan Idaho or the man called Hayt?” Paul asked.\nThe ghola came to a stop two paces from him. “Which would my Lord prefer?”\nThe voice carried a soft ring of caution.\n“Play the Zensunni,” Paul said bitterly. Meanings within meanings! What could a Zensunni philosopher say or do to change one jot of the reality unrolling before them at this instant?\n“My Lord is troubled.”\nPaul turned away, stared at the Shield Wall’s distant scarp, Saw wind-carved arches and buttresses, terrible mimicry of his city. Nature playing a joke on him! See what I can build! He recognized a slash in the distant massif, a place where sand spilled from a crevasse, and thought: There! Right there, we fought Sardaukar!\n“What troubles my lord?” the ghola asked.\n“A vision,” Paul whispered.\n“Ahhhhh, when the Tleilaxu first awakened me, | had visions. | was restless, lonely .. . not really Knowing | was lonely. Not then. My visions revealed nothing! The Tleilaxu told me it was an intrusion of the flesh which men and gholas all suffer, a sickness, no more.”\nPaul turned, studied the ghola’s eyes, those pitted, steely balls without expression. What visions did those eyes see?\n“Duncan...Duncan...” Paul whispered.\n“I am called Hayt.”\n“I saw a moon fall,” Paul said. “It was gone, destroyed. | heard a great hissing. The earth shook.”\n“You are drunk on too much time,” the ghola said.\n“I ask for the Zensunni and get the mentat!” Paul said. “Very well! Play my vision through your logic, mentat. Analyze it and reduce it to mere words laid out for burial.”\n“Burial, indeed,” the ghola said. “You run from death. You strain at the next instant, refuse to live here and now.\nAugury! What a crutch for an Emperor!”\nPaul found himself fascinated by a well-remembered mole on the ghola’s chin.\n“Trying to live in this future,” the ghola said, “do you give substance to such a future? Do you make it real?”\n“If | go the way of my vision-future, l'Il be alive then,” Paul muttered. “What makes you think | want to live there?”\nThe ghola shrugged. “You asked me for a substantial answer.”\n“Where is there substance in a universe composed of events?” Paul asked. “Is there a final answer? Doesn’t each solution produce new questions?”\n“You’ve digested so much time you have delusions of immortality,” the ghola said. “Even your Empire, my lord, must live its time and die.”\n“Don’t parade smoke-blackened altars before me,” Paul growled. “I’ve heard enough sad histories of gods and messiahs. Why should | need special powers to forecast ruins of my own like all those others? The lowliest servant of my kitchens could do this.” He shook his head. “The moon fell!”\n“You’ve not brought your mind to rest at its beginning,” the ghola said.\n“Is that how you destroy me?” Paul demanded. “Prevent me from collecting my thoughts?”\n“Can you collect chaos?” the ghola asked. “We Zensunni say: ‘Not collecting, that is the ultimate gathering.’ What can you gather without gathering yourself?”\n“I’m deviled by a vision and you sp", "? Doesn’t each solution produce new questions?”\n“You’ve digested so much time you have delusions of immortality,” the ghola said. “Even your Empire, my lord, must live its time and die.”\n“Don’t parade smoke-blackened altars before me,” Paul growled. “I’ve heard enough sad histories of gods and messiahs. Why should | need special powers to forecast ruins of my own like all those others? The lowliest servant of my kitchens could do this.” He shook his head. “The moon fell!”\n“You’ve not brought your mind to rest at its beginning,” the ghola said.\n“Is that how you destroy me?” Paul demanded. “Prevent me from collecting my thoughts?”\n“Can you collect chaos?” the ghola asked. “We Zensunni say: ‘Not collecting, that is the ultimate gathering.’ What can you gather without gathering yourself?”\n“I’m deviled by a vision and you spew nonsense!” Paul raged. “What do you know of prescience?”\n“I’ve seen the oracle at work,” the ghola said. “I’ve seen those who seek signs and omens for their individual destiny. They fear what they seek.”\n“My falling moon is real,” Paul whispered. He took a trembling breath. “It moves. It moves.”\n“Men always fear things which move by themselves,” the ghola said. “You fear your own powers. Things fall into your head from nowhere. When they fall out, where do they go?”\n“You comfort me with thorns,” Paul growled.\nAn inner illumination came over the ghola’s face. For a moment, he became pure Duncan Idaho. “I give you what comfort | can,” he said.\nPaul wondered at that momentary spasm. Had the ghola felt grief which his mind rejected? Had Hayt put down a vision of his own?\n“My moon has a name,” Paul whispered.\nHe let the vision flow over him then. Though his whole being shrieked, no sound escaped him. He was afraid to speak, fearful that his voice might betray him. The air of this terrifying future was thick with Chani’s absence. Flesh that had cried in ecstasy, eyes that had burned him with their desire, the voice that had charmed him because it played no tricks of subtle control—all gone, back into the water and the sand.\nSlowly, Paul turned away, looked out at the present and the plaza before Alia’s temple. Three shaven-headed pilgrims entered from the processional avenue. They wore grimy yellow robes and hurried with their heads bent against the afternoon’s wind. One walked with a limp, dragging his left foot. They beat their way against the wind, rounded a corner and were gone from his sight.\nJust as his moon would go, they were gone. Still, his vision lay before him. Its terrible purpose gave him no choice.\nThe flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? | occurred. | am not... yet, | occurred.\nYou do not beg the sun for mercy.\n—MUAD’DIB’S TRAVAIL FROM THE STILGAR COMMENTARY\nO ne moment of incompetence can be fatal, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam reminded herself.\nShe hobbled along, apparently unconcerned, within a ring of Fremen guards. One of those behind her, she knew, was a deaf-mute immune to any wiles of Voice. No doubt he’d been charged to kill her at the slightest provocation.\nWhy had Paul summoned her? she wondered. Was he about to pass sentence? She remembered the day long ago when she'd tested him... the child kwisatz haderach. He was a deep one.\nDamn his mother for all eternity! It was her fault the Bene Gesserit had lost their hold on this gene line.\nSilence surged along the vaulted passages ahead of her entourage. She sensed the word being passed. Paul would hear the silence. He’d know of her coming before it was announced. She didn’t delude herself with ideas that her powers exceeded his.\nDamn him!\nShe begrudged the burdens age had imposed on her: the aching joints, responses not as quick as once they’d been, muscles not as elastic as the whipcords of her youth. A long day lay behind her and a long life. She’d spent this day with the Dune Tarot in a fruitless search for some clue to her own fate. But the cards were sluggish.\nThe guards herded her around a corner into another of the seemingly endless vaulted passages. Triangular meta- glass windows on her left gave a view upward to trellised vines and indigo flowers in deep shadows cast by the\nafternoon sun. Tiles lay underfoot—figures of water creatures from exotic planets. Water reminders everywhere. Wealth ... riches.\nRobed figures passed across another hall in front of her, cast covert glances at the Reverend Mother. Recognition was obvious in their manner—and tension.\nShe kept her attention on the sharp hairline of the guard immediately in front: young flesh, pink creases at the uniform collar.\nThe immensity of this ighir citadel began to impress her. Passages... passages... They passed an open doorway from which emerged the sound of timbur and flute playing soft, elder music. A glance showed her blue-in-blue Fremen eyes staring from the room. She sensed in them the ferment of legendary revolts stirring in wild genes.\nThere lay the measure of her personal burden, she knew. A Bene Gesserit could not escape awareness of the genes and their possibilities. She was touched by a feeling of loss: that stubborn fool of an Atreides! How could he deny the jewels of posterity within his loins? A kwisatz haderach! Born out of this time, true, but real—as real as his abomination of a sister... and there lay a dangerous unknown. A wild Reverend Mother spawned without Bene Gesserit inhibitions, holding no loyalty to orderly development of the genes. She shared her brother’s powers, no doubt—and more.\nThe size of the citadel began to oppress her. Would the passages never end? The place reeked of terrifying physical power. No planet, no civilization in all human history had ever before seen such man-made immensity. A dozen ancient cities could be hidden in its walls!\nThey passed oval doors with winking lights. She recognized them for Ixian handiwork: pneumatic transport orifices. Why was she being marched all this distance, then? The answer began to shape itself in her mind: to oppress her in preparation for this audience with the Emperor.\nA small clue, but it joined other subtle indications—the relative suppression and selection of words by her escort, the traces of primitive shyness in their eyes when they called her Reverend Mother, the cold and bland, essentially odorless nature of these halls—all combined to reveal much that a Bene Gesserit could interpret.\nPaul wanted something from her!\nShe concealed a feeling of elation. A bargaining lever existed. It remained only to find the nature of that lever and test its strength. Some levers had moved things greater than this citadel. A finger’s touch had been known to topple civilizations.\nThe Reverend Mother reminded herself then of Scytale’s assessment: When a creature has developed into one thing, he will choose death rather than change into his opposite.\nThe passages through which she was being escorted grew larger by subtle stages—tricks of arching, graduated amplification of pillared supports, displacement of the triangular windows by larger, oblong shapes. Ahead of her, finally, loomed double doors centered in the far wall of a tall antechamber. She sensed that the doors were very large, and was forced to suppress a gasp as her trained awareness measured out the true proportions. The doorway stood at least eighty meters high, half that in width.\nAs she approached with her escort, the doors swung inward—an immense and silent movement of hidden machinery. She recognized more Ixian handiwork. Through that towering doorway she marched with her guards into the Grand Reception Hall of the Emperor Paul Atreides —“Muad’Dib, before whom all people are dwarfed.” Now, she saw the effect of that popular saying at work.\nAs she advanced toward Paul on the distant throne, the Reverend Mother found herself more impressed by the architectural subtleties of her surroundings than she was by the immensities. The space was large: it could’ve housed the entire citadel of any ruler in human history. The open\nsweep of the room said much about hidden structural forces balanced with nicety. Trusses and supporting beams behind these walls and the faraway domed ceiling must surpass anything ever before attempted. Everything spoke of engineering genius.\nWithout seeming to do so, the hall grew smaller at its far end, refusing to dwarf Paul on his throne centered on a dais. An untrained awareness, shocked by surrounding proportions, would see him at first as many times larger than his actual size. Colors played upon the unprotected psyche: Paul’s green throne had been cut from a single Hagar emerald. It suggested growing things and, out of the Fremen mythos, reflected the mourning color. It whispered that here sat he who could make you mourn—life and death in one symbol, a clever stress of opposites. Behind the throne, draperies cascaded in burnt orange, curried gold of Dune earth, and cinnamon flecks of melange. To a trained eye, the symbolism was obvious, but it contained hammer blows to beat down the uninitiated.\nTime played its role here.\nThe Reverend Mother measured the minutes required to approach the Imperial Presence at her hobbling pace. You had time to be cowed. Any tendency toward resentment would be squeezed out of you by the unbridled power which focused down upon your person. You might start the long march toward that throne as a human of dignity, but you ended the march as a gnat.\nAides and attendants stood around the Emperor in a curiously ordered sequence—attentive household guardsmen along the draped back wall; that abomination, Alia, two steps below Paul and on his left hand; Stilgar, the Imperial lackey, on the step directly below Alia; and on the right, one step up from the floor of the hall, a solitary figure: the fleshly revenant of Duncan Idaho, the ghola. She marked older Fremen among the guardsmen, bearded Naibs with stillsuit scars on their noses, sheathed crysknives at\ntheir waists, a few maula pistols, even some lasguns. Those must be trusted men, she thought, to carry lasguns in Paul’s presence when he obviously wore a shield generator. She could see the shimmering of its field around him. One burst of a lasgun into that field and the entire citadel would be a hole in the ground.\nHer guard stopped ten paces from the foot of the dais, parted to open an unobstructed view of the Emperor. She noted now the absence of Chani and Irulan, wondered at it. He held no important audience without them, so it was said.\nPaul nodded to her, silent, measuring.\nImmediately, she decided to take the offensive, said: “So, the great Paul Atreides deigns to see the one he banished.”\nPaul smiled wryly, thinking: She knows | want something from her. That knowledge had been inevitable, she being who she was. He recognized her powers. The Bene Gesserit didn’t become Reverend Mothers by chance.\n“Shall we dispense with fencing?” he asked.\nWould it be this easy? she wondered. And she said: “Name the thing you want", " field around him. One burst of a lasgun into that field and the entire citadel would be a hole in the ground.\nHer guard stopped ten paces from the foot of the dais, parted to open an unobstructed view of the Emperor.

The Bene Gesserit didn’t become Reverend Mothers by chance.\n“Shall we dispense with fencing?” he asked.\nWould it be this easy? she wondered. And she said: “Name the thing you want.”\nStilgar stirred, cast a sharp glance at Paul. The Imperial lackey didn’t like her tone.\n“Stilgar wants me to send you away,” Paul said.\n“Not kill me?” she asked. “I would’ve expected something more direct from a Fremen Naib.”\nStilgar scowled, said: “Often, | must speak otherwise than | think. That is called diplomacy.”\n“Then let us dispense with diplomacy as well,” she said. “Was it necessary to have me walk all that distance? | am an old woman.”\n“You had to be shown how callous | can be,” Paul said. “That way, you'll appreciate magnanimity.”\n“You dare such gaucheries with a Bene Gesserit?” she asked.\n“Gross actions carry their own messages,” Paul said.\nShe hesitated, weighed his words. So—he might yet dispense with her... grossly, obviously, if she... if she what?\n“Say what it is you want from me,” she muttered.\nAlia glanced at her brother, nodded toward the draperies behind the throne. She knew Paul’s reasoning in this, but disliked it all the same. Call it wild prophecy: She felt pregnant with reluctance to take part in this bargaining.\n“You must be careful how you speak to me, old woman,” Paul said.\nHe called me old woman when he was a Stripling, the Reverend Mother thought. Does he remind me now of my hand in his past? The decision | made then, must I remake it here? She felt the weight of decision, a physical thing that set her knees to trembling. Muscles cried their fatigue.\n“It was a long walk,” Paul said, “and | can see that you’re tired. We will retire to my private chamber behind the throne. You may sit there.” He gave a hand-signal to Stilgar, arose.\nStilgar and the ghola converged on her, helped her up the steps, followed Paul through a passage concealed by the draperies. She realized then why he had greeted her in the hall: a dumb-show for the guards and Naibs. He feared them, then. And now—now, he displayed kindly benevolence, daring such wiles on a Bene Gesserit. Or was it daring? She sensed another presence behind, glanced back to see Alia following. The younger woman’s eyes held a brooding, baleful cast. The Reverend Mother shuddered.\nThe private chamber at the end of the passage was a twenty-meter cube of plasmeld, yellow glowglobes for light, the deep orange hangings of a desert stilltent around the walls. It contained divans, soft cushions, a faint odor of melange, crystal water flagons on a low table. It felt cramped, tiny after the outer hall.\nPaul seated her on a divan, stood over her, studying the ancient face—steely teeth, eyes that hid more than they\nrevealed, deeply wrinkled skin. He indicated a water flagon. She shook her head, dislodging a wisp of gray hair.\nIn a low voice, Paul said: “I wish to bargain with you for the life of my beloved.”\nStilgar cleared his throat.\nAlia fingered the handle of the crysknife sheathed at her neck.\nThe ghola remained at the door, face impassive, metal eyes pointed at the air above the Reverend Mother’s head.\n“Have you had a vision of my hand in her death?” the Reverend Mother asked. She kept her attention on the ghola, oddly disturbed by him. Why should she feel threatened by the ghola? He was a tool of the conspiracy.\n“I know what it is you want from me,” Paul said, avoiding her question.\nThen he only suspects, she thought. The Reverend Mother looked down at the tips of her shoes exposed by a fold of her robe. Black... black... shoes and robe showed marks of her confinement: stains, wrinkles. She lifted her chin, met an angry glare in Paul’s eyes. Elation surged through her, but she hid the emotion behind pursed lips, slitted eyelids.\n“What coin do you offer?” she asked.\n“You may have my seed, but not my person,” Paul said. “Irulan banished and inseminated by artificial—”\n“You dare!” the Reverend Mother flared, stiffening.\nStilgar took a half step forward.\nDisconcertingly, the ghola smiled. And now Alia was studying him.\n“We'll not discuss the things your Sisterhood forbids,” Paul said. “I will listen to no talk of sins, abominations or the beliefs left over from past Jihads. You may have my seed for your plans, but no child of Irulan’s will sit on my throne.”\n“Your throne,” she sneered.\n“My throne.”\n“Then who will bear the Imperial heir?”\n“Chani.”\n“She is barren.”\n“She is with child.”\nAn involuntary indrawn breath exposed her shock. “You lie!” she snapped.\nPaul held up a restraining hand as Stilgar surged forward.\n“We've known for two days that she carries my child.”\n“But Irulan.. .”\n“By artificial means only. That’s my offer.”\nThe Reverend Mother closed her eyes to hide his face. Damnation! To cast the genetic dice in such a way! Loathing boiled in her breast. The teaching of the Bene Gesserit, the lessons of the Butlerian Jinad—all proscribed such an act. One did not demean the highest aspirations of humankind. No machine could function in the way of a human mind. No word or deed could imply that men might be bred on the level of animals.\n“Your decision,” Paul said.\nShe shook her head. The genes, the precious Atreides genes—only these were important. Need went deeper than proscription. For the Sisterhood, mating mingled more than sperm and ovum. One aimed to capture the psyche.\nThe Reverend Mother understood now the subtle depths of Paul’s offer. He would make the Bene Gesserit party to an act which would bring down popular wrath... were it ever discovered. They could not admit such paternity if the Emperor denied it. This coin might save the Atreides genes for the Sisterhood, but it would never buy a throne.\nShe swept her gaze around the room, studying each face: Stilgar, passive and waiting now; the ghola frozen at some inward place; Alia watching the ghola ... and Paul—wrath beneath a shallow veneer.\n“This is your only offer?” she asked.\n“My only offer.”\nShe glanced at the ghola, caught by a brief movement of muscles across his cheeks. Emotion? “You, ghola,” she said.\n“Should such an offer be made? Having been made, should it be accepted? Function as the mentat for us.”\nThe metallic eyes turned to Paul.\n“Answer as you will,” Paul said.\nThe ghola returned his gleaming attention to the Reverend Mother, shocked her once more by smiling. “An offer is only as good as the real thing it buys,” he said. “The exchange offered here is life-for-life, a high order of business.”\nAlia brushed a strand of coppery hair from her forehead, said: “And what else is hidden in this bargain?”\nThe Reverend Mother refused to look at Alia, but the words burned in her mind. Yes, far deeper implications lay here. The sister was an abomination, true, but there could be no denying her status as a Reverend Mother with all the title implied. Gaius Helen Mohiam felt herself in this instant to be not one single person, but all the others who sat like tiny congeries in her memory. They were alert, every Reverend Mother she had absorbed in becoming a Priestess of the Sisterhood. Alia would be standing in the same situation here.\n“What else?” the ghola asked. “One wonders why the witches of the Bene Gesserit have not used Tleilaxu methods.”\nGaius Helen Mohiam and all the Reverend Mothers within her shuddered. Yes, the Tleilaxu did loathsome things. If one let down the barriers to artificial insemination, was the next step a Tleilaxu one—controlled mutation?\nPaul, observing the play of emotion around him, felt abruptly that he no longer knew these people. He could see only strangers. Even Alia was a stranger.\nAlia said: “If we set the Atreides genes adrift in a Bene Gesserit river, who knows what may result?”\nGaius Helen Mohiam’s head snapped around, and she met Alia’s gaze. For a flashing instant, they were two Reverend Mothers together, communing on a single\nthought: What lay behind any Tleilaxu action? The ghola was a Tleilaxu thing. Had he put this plan into Paul’s mind? Would Paul attempt to bargain directly with the Bene Tleilax?\nShe broke her gaze from Alia’s, feeling her own ambivalence and inadequacies. The pitfall of Bene Gesserit training, she reminded herself, lay in the powers granted: such powers predisposed one to vanity and pride. But power deluded those who used it. One tended to believe power could overcome any barrier... including one’s own ignorance.\nOnly one thing stood paramount here for the Bene Gesserit, she told herself. That was the pyramid of generations which had reached an apex in Paul Atreides... and in his abomination of a sister. A wrong choice here and the pyramid would have to be rebuilt . . . starting generations back in the parallel lines and with breeding specimens lacking the choicest characteristics.\nControlled mutation, she thought. Did the Tleilaxu really practice it? How tempting! She shook her head, the better to rid it of such thoughts.\n“You reject my proposal?” Paul asked.\n“I’m thinking,” she said.\nAnd again, she looked at the sister. The optimum cross for this female Atreides had been lost... killed by Paul. Another possibility remained, however—one which would cement the desired characteristic into an offspring. Paul dared offer animal breeding to the Bene Gesserit! How much was he really prepared to pay for his Chani’s life? Would he accept a cross with his own sister?\nSparring for time, the Reverend Mother said: “Tell me, oh flawless exemplar of all that’s holy, has Irulan anything to say of your proposal?”\n“Irulan will do what you tell her to do,” Paul growled.\nTrue enough, Mohiam thought. She firmed her jaw, offered a new gambit: “There are two Atreides.”\nPaul, sensing something of what lay in the old witch’s mind, felt blood darken his face. “Careful what you suggest,” he said.\n“You'd just use Irulan to gain your own ends, eh?” she asked.\n“Wasn't she trained to"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_6df0b13c4e372e3b47ff8664fbad4a1651f9ed9d9d0019c1556f3fedcc30c367_v2"}
