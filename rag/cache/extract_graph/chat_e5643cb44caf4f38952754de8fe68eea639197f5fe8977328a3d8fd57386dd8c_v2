And now she lived only for the children given to Paul by his Fremen concubine, Chani.\nJessica spoke first: “Where are my grandchildren?”\n“At Sietch Tabr.”\n“Too dangerous for them here; | understand.”\nlrulan permitted herself a faint nod. She had observed the interchange between Jessica and Alia, but put upon it an interpretation for which Alia had prepared her. “/essica has returned to the Sisterhood and we both know they have plans for Paul’s children.” \\rulan had never been the most accomplished adept in the Bene Gesserit—valuable more for the fact that she was a daughter of Shaddam IV than for any other reason; often too proud to exert herself in extending her capabilities. Now she chose sides with an abruptness which did no credit to her training.\n“Really, Jessica,” Irulan said, “the Royal Council should have been consulted. It was wrong of you to work only through—”\n“Am | to believe none of you trust Stilgar?” Jessica asked.\nlrulan possessed the wit to realize there could be no answer to such a question. She was glad that the priestly delegates, unable to contain their impatience any longer, pressed forward. She exchanged a glance with Alia, thinking: /essica’s as haughty and certain of herself as ever! A Bene Gesserit axiom arose unbidden in her mind, though: “The haughty do but build castle walls behind which they try to hide their doubts and fears.” Could that be true of Jessica? Surely not. Then it must be a pose. But for what purpose? The question disturbed Irulan.\nThe priests were noisy in their possession of Muad’Dib’s mother. Some only touched her arms, but most bowed low and spoke greetings. At last the leaders of the delegation took their turn with the Most Holy Reverend Mother, accepting the ordained role—“The first shall be last”—with practiced smiles, telling her that the official Lustration ceremony awaited her at the Keep, Paul’s old fortress- stronghold.\nJessica studied the pair, finding them repellent. One was called Javid, a young man of surly features and round cheeks, shadowed eyes which could not hide the suspicions lurking in their depths. The other was Zebataleph, second son of a Naib she’d known in her Fremen days, as he was quick to remind her. He was easily classified: jollity linked with ruthlessness, a thin face with blond beard, an air about him of secret excitements and powerful knowledge. Javid she judged far more dangerous of the two, a man of private counsel, simultaneously magnetic and—she could find no other word— repellent. She found his accents strange, full of old Fremen pronunciations, as though he’d come from some isolated pocket of his people.\n“Tell me, Javid,” she said, “whence come you?”\n“lam but a simple Fremen of the desert,” he said, every syllable giving the lie to the statement.\nZebataleph intruded with an offensive deference, almost mocking: “We have much to discuss of the old days, My\nLady. | was one of the first, you Know, to recognize the holy nature of your son’s mission.”\n“But you weren’t one of his Fedaykin,” she said.\n“No, My Lady. | possessed a more philosophic bent; | studied for the priesthood.”\nAnd insured the preservation of your skin, she thought.\nJavid said: “They await us at the Keep, My Lady.”\nAgain she found the strangeness of his accent an open question demanding an answer. “Who awaits us?” she asked.\n“The Convocation of the Faith, all those who keep bright the name and the deeds of your holy son,” Javid said.\nJessica glanced around her, saw Alia smiling at Javid, asked: “Is this man one of your appointees, daughter?”\nAlia nodded. “A man destined for great deeds.”\nBut Jessica saw that Javid had no pleasure in this attention, marked him for Gurney’s special study. And there came Gurney with five trusted men, signaling that they had the suspicious laggards under interrogation. He walked with the rolling stride of a powerful man, glance flicking left, right, all around, every muscle flowing through the relaxed alertness she had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit prana-bindu manual. He was an ugly lump of trained reflexes, a killer, and altogether terrifying to some, but Jessica loved him and prized him above all other living men. The scar of an inkvine whip rippled along his jaw, giving him a sinister appearance, but a smile softened his face as he saw Stilgar.\n“Well done, Stil,” he said. And they gripped arms in the Fremen fashion.\n“The Lustration,” Javid said, touching Jessica’s arm.\nJessica drew back, chose her words carefully in the controlled power of Voice, her tone and delivery calculated for a precise emotional effect upon Javid and Zebataleph: “l returned to Dune to see my grandchildren. Must we take time for this priestly nonsense?”\nZebataleph reacted with shock, his mouth dropping open, eyes alarmed, glancing about at those who had heard. The eyes marked each listener. Priestly nonsense! What effect would such words have, coming from the mother of their messiah?\nJavid, however, confirmed Jessica’s assessment. His mouth hardened, then smiled. The eyes did not smile, nor did they waver to mark the listeners. Javid already knew each member of this party. He had an earshot map of those who would be watched with special care from this point onward. Only seconds later, Javid stopped smiling with an abruptness which said he knew how he had betrayed himself. Javid had not failed to do his homework: he knew the observational powers possessed by the Lady Jessica. A Short, jerking nod of his head acknowledged those powers.\nIn a lightning flash of mentation, Jessica weighed the necessities. A subtle hand signal to Gurney would bring Javid’s death. It could be done here for effect, or in quiet later, and be made to appear an accident.\nShe thought: When we try to conceal our innermost drives, the entire being screams betrayal. Bene Gesserit training turned upon this revelation—raising the adepts above it and teaching them to read the open flesh of others. She saw Javid’s intelligence as valuable, a temporary weight in the balance. If he could be won over, he could be the link she needed, the line into the Arrakeen priesthood. And he was Alia’s man.\nJessica said: “My official party must remain small. We have room for one addition, however. Javid, you will join us. Zebataleph, | am sorry. And, Javid ... I will attend this—this ceremony—if you insist.”\nJavid allowed himself a deep breath and a low-voiced “As Muad’Dib’s mother commands.” He glanced to Alia, to Zebataleph, back to Jessica. “It pains me to delay the reunion with your grandchildren, but there are, ahhh, reasons of state...”\nJessica thought: Good. He’s a businessman above all else. Once we’ve determined the proper coinage, we'll buy him. And she found herself enjoying the fact that he insisted on his precious ceremony. This little victory would give him power with his fellows, and they both knew it. Accepting his Lustration could be a down payment on later services.\n“| presume you've arranged transportation,” she said.\n| give you the desert chameleon, whose ability to blend itself into the background tells you all you need to know about the roots of ecology and the foundations of a personal identity.\n—BOOK OF DIATRIBES FROM THE HAYT CHRONICLE\neto sat playing a small baliset which had been sent to\nhim on his fifth birthday by that consummate artist of the instrument, Gurney Halleck. In four years of practice, Leto had achieved a certain fluency, although the two bass side Strings still gave him trouble. He had found the baliset soothing, however, for particular feelings of upset—a fact which had not escaped Ghanima. He sat now in twilight on a rock shelf at the southernmost extremity of the craggy outcropping which sheltered Sietch Tabr. Softly he strummed the baliset.\nGhanima stood behind him, her small figure radiating protest. She had not wanted to come here into the open after learning from Stilgar that their grandmother was delayed in Arrakeen. She particularly objected to coming here with nightfall near. Attempting to hurry her brother, She asked: “Well, what is it?”\nFor an answer, he began another tune.\nFor the first time since accepting the gift, Leto felt intensely aware that this baliset had originated with a master craftsman on Caladan. He possessed inherited memories which could inflict him with profound nostalgia for that beautiful planet where House Atreides had ruled. Leto had but to relax his inner barriers in the presence of this music and he would hear memories from those times when Gurney had employed the baliset to beguile his friend and\ncharge, Paul Atreides. With the baliset sounding in his own hands, Leto felt himself more and more dominated by his father’s psychical presence. Still he played, relating more strongly to the instrument with every second that passed. He sensed the absolute idealized summation within himself which knew how to play this baliset, though nine-year-old muscles had not yet been conditioned to that inner awareness.\nGhanima tapped her foot impatiently, unaware that she matched the rhythm of her brother’s playing.\nSetting his mouth in a grimace of concentration, Leto broke from the familiar music and tried a song more ancient than any even Gurney had played. It had been old when Fremen migrated to their fifth planet. The words echoed a Zensunni theme, and he heard them in his memory while his fingers elicited a faltering version of the tune.\nNature’s beauteous form Contains a lovely essence Called by some—decay.\nBy this lovely presence New life finds its way. Tears shed silently\nAre but water of the soul: They bring new life\nTo the pain of being—\nA separation from that seeing Which death makes whole.\nGhanima spoke behind him as he strummed the final note. “There’s a mucky old song. Why that one?”\n“Because it fits.”\n“Will you play it for Gurney?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“He'll call it moody nonsense.”\n“I know.”\nLeto peered back over his shoulder at Ghanima. There was no Surprise in him that she knew the song and its lyrics,\nbut he felt a sudden onset of awe at the singleness of their twinned lives. One of them could die and yet remain alive in the other’s consciousness, every shared memory intact; they were that close. He found himself frightened by the timeless web of that closeness, broke his gaze away from her. The web contained gaps, he knew. His fear arose from the newest of those gaps. He felt their lives beginning to separate and wondered: How can I tell her of this thing which has happened only to me?\nHe peered out over the desert, seeing the deep shadows behind the barachans—those high, crescent-shaped migratory dunes which moved like waves around Arrakis. This was Kedem, the inner desert, and its dunes were rarely marked these days by the irregularities of a giant worm’s progress. Sunset drew bloody streaks over the dunes, imparting a fiery light to the shadow edges. A hawk falling from the crimson sky captured his awareness as it captured a rock partridge in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e5643cb44caf4f38952754de8fe68eea639197f5fe8977328a3d8fd57386dd8c_v2"}
