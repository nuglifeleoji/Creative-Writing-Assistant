�已危，乃告庞德曰：“军士折伤大半，四下无路，不如投降。”庞德大怒曰：“吾受魏王厚恩，岂肯屈节于人！”遂亲斩董衡、董超于前，厉声曰：“再说降者，以此二人为例！”于是众皆奋力御敌。自平明战至日中，勇力倍增。关公催四面急攻，矢石如雨。德令军士用短兵接战。德回顾成何曰：“吾闻勇将不怯死以苟免，壮士不毁节而求生。今日乃我死日也。汝可努力死战。”成何依令向前，被关公一箭射落水中。众军皆降，止有庞德一人力战。正遇荆州数十人，驾小船近堤来，德提刀飞身一跃，早上小船，立杀十余人，余皆弃船赴水逃命。庞德一手提刀，一手使短棹，欲向樊城而走。只见上流头，一将撑大筏而至，将小船撞翻，庞德落于水中。船上那将跳下水去，生擒庞德上船。众视之，擒庞德者，乃周仓也。仓素知水性，又在荆州住了数年，愈加惯熟；更兼力大，因此擒了庞德。于禁所领七军，皆死于水中。其会水者料无去路，亦皆投降。后人有诗曰：“夜半征鼙响震天，襄樊平地作深渊。关公神算谁能及，华夏威名万古传。”\n\n    关公回到高阜去处，升帐而坐。群刀手押过于禁来。禁拜伏于地，乞哀请命。关公曰：“汝怎敢抗吾？”禁曰：“上命差遣，身不由己。望君侯怜悯，誓以死报。”公绰髯笑曰：“吾杀汝，犹杀狗彘耳，空污刀斧！”令人缚送荆州大牢内监候：“待吾回，别作区处。”发落去讫。关公又令押过庞德。德睁眉怒目，立而不跪，关公曰：“汝兄现在汉中；汝故主马超，亦在蜀中为大将。汝如何不早降？”德大怒曰：“吾宁死于刀下，岂降汝耶！”骂不绝口。公大怒，喝令刀斧手推出斩之。德引颈受刑。关公怜而葬之。于是乘水势未退，复上战船，引大小将校来攻樊城。却说樊城周围，白浪滔天，水势益甚，城垣渐渐浸塌，男女担土搬砖，填塞不住。曹军众将，无不丧胆，慌忙来告曹仁曰：“今日之危，非力可救；可趁敌军未至，乘舟夜走，虽然失城，尚可全身。”仁从其言。方欲备船出走，满宠谏曰：“不可。山水骤至，岂能长存？不旬日即当自退。关公虽未攻城，已遣别将在郏下。其所以不敢轻进者，虑吾军袭其后也。今若弃城而去，黄河以南，非国家之有矣。”愿将军�\n######################\nOutput:",
