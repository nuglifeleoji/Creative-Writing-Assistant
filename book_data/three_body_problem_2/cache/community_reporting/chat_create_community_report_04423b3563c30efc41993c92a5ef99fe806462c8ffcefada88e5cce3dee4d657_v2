The organization is dedicated to maintaining international peace and security, and it coordinates global affairs, including proposals for technological public ownership.\n\nThe United Nations has also been recognized for its historical significance, such as receiving a sculpture titled \"\"Èì∏Ââë‰∏∫ÁäÅ\"\" (Turning Swords into Plowshares) from the former Soviet government. Additionally, it has conferred the title of Wallfacer upon individuals like ÁΩóËæë (Luo Ji), who has sought to engage with the UN through video systems and has previously declined missions assigned to him.\n\nDespite its many responsibilities, the United Nations has faced criticism, including accusations of being responsible for the release of Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ (Radiance). Nonetheless, it remains a pivotal entity in the management of global affairs and the continuation of human civilization, striving to enhance resource scrutiny and limitations for strategic plans through legislative revisions.\n\nIn summary, the United Nations is a multifaceted organization that plays a vital role in international diplomacy, crisis management, and the promotion of global peace and cooperation, while also navigating complex challenges and criticisms in its mission to serve humanity.\",30\r\n260,Âà´Â¢Ö,ËøôÂ∫ßÂà´Â¢ÖÂª∫‰∫éÂçÅ‰πù‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∏≠Âè∂Ôºå‰Ωç‰∫éÊπñËæπÔºåÂÜÖÈÉ®Áé∞‰ª£ÂåñÔºåÂ§ñË°®Âè§ËÄÅ„ÄÇ,10\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n302,ÁΩóËæë,ÂßîÂëò‰ºö,ÁΩóËæëÁöÑËÆ°ÂàíÈúÄË¶ÅÁªèËøáÂßîÂëò‰ºöÁöÑÂÆ°Ê†∏ÔºåÂßîÂëò‰ºöË¥üË¥£ËØÑ‰º∞Èù¢Â£ÅËÄÖÁöÑÂä®Êú∫ÂíåËµÑÊ∫ê‰ΩøÁî®,234\r\n602,ÁΩóËæë,ËΩªÊµÅÊÑü,\"ÁΩóËæë expresses concern about the flu that is affecting those around him, including his colleague\",234\r\n350,Ëâæ‰º¶,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ,\"Ëâæ‰º¶‰∏éÈõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπÂú®Ê†∏ÂºπÈ°πÁõÆ‰∏äÂ±ïÂºÄ‰∫ÜÊ∑±ÂÖ•ÁöÑËÆ®ËÆ∫ÔºåÂ±ïÁé∞‰∫Ü‰ªñ‰ª¨Âú®ÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂È¢ÜÂüüÁöÑÂêà‰ΩúÂÖ≥Á≥ª„ÄÇ‰∏§‰∫∫ÂÖ±ÂêåÊé¢ËÆ®‰∫ÜÊ†∏ÂºπÁöÑËÆæËÆ°ÂíåÂ§çÊùÇÊÄßÔºåÊ∑±ÂÖ•ÂàÜÊûê‰∫ÜÊ†∏Ê≠¶Âô®Âú®Â§™Á©∫Êàò‰∫â‰∏≠ÁöÑÊïàËÉΩÔºåÂπ∂ÂàÜ‰∫´‰∫ÜÂêÑËá™ÁöÑËßÇÁÇπ„ÄÇËâæ‰º¶Âú®ËÆ®ËÆ∫‰∏≠Ë°®Áé∞Âá∫ÂØπÊ†∏Ê≠¶Âô®ÊäÄÊúØÁöÑÁÉ≠ÊÉÖÂíå‰∏ì‰∏öÁü•ËØÜÔºåËÄåÈõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπÂàôÂØπÊ†∏ÂºπÈ°πÁõÆÊåÅÊúâ‰∏ÄÂÆöÁöÑÊÄÄÁñëÊÄÅÂ∫¶ÔºåÊèêÂá∫‰∫ÜÂØπËÆæËÆ°ÂíåÊäÄÊúØË¶ÅÊ±ÇÁöÑË¥®Áñë„ÄÇ\n\nÂú®‰ªñ‰ª¨ÁöÑ‰∫§ÊµÅ‰∏≠ÔºåËâæ‰º¶Âº∫Ë∞É‰∫ÜÊ†∏Ê≠¶Âô®Âú®Áé∞‰ª£Êàò‰∫â‰∏≠ÁöÑÊΩúÂú®Â∫îÁî®ÔºåÂ∞§ÂÖ∂ÊòØÂú®Â§™Á©∫È¢ÜÂüüÁöÑÊàòÁï•ÊÑè‰πâ„ÄÇ‰ªñËÆ§‰∏∫ÔºåÈöèÁùÄÁßëÊäÄÁöÑÂèëÂ±ïÔºåÊ†∏Ê≠¶Âô®ÁöÑËÆæËÆ°ÈúÄË¶Å‰∏çÊñ≠Êõ¥Êñ∞Ôºå‰ª•ÈÄÇÂ∫îÊñ∞ÁöÑÊàòÊñóÁéØÂ¢ÉÂíåÊàòÊúØÈúÄÊ±Ç„ÄÇÈõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπÂàô‰ªé‰∏Ä‰∏™Êõ¥Ë∞®ÊÖéÁöÑËßíÂ∫¶Âá∫ÂèëÔºåÂÖ≥Ê≥®Ê†∏Ê≠¶Âô®ÁöÑÂÆâÂÖ®ÊÄßÂíå‰º¶ÁêÜÈóÆÈ¢òÔºåËÆ§‰∏∫Âú®ËøΩÊ±ÇÊäÄÊúØËøõÊ≠•ÁöÑÂêåÊó∂ÔºåÂøÖÈ°ªËÄÉËôëÂÖ∂ÂèØËÉΩÂ∏¶Êù•ÁöÑÈ£éÈô©ÂíåÂêéÊûú„ÄÇ\n\nÂ∞ΩÁÆ°‰∏§‰∫∫Âú®Êüê‰∫õËßÇÁÇπ‰∏äÂ≠òÂú®ÂàÜÊ≠ßÔºå‰ΩÜ‰ªñ‰ª¨ÁöÑËÆ®ËÆ∫‰ªçÁÑ∂ÂØåÊúâÂª∫ËÆæÊÄßÔºå‰ΩìÁé∞‰∫ÜÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂‰∏≠‰∏çÂêåÊÑèËßÅÁ¢∞ÊíûÊâÄÂ∏¶Êù•ÁöÑÂêØÂèë„ÄÇËâæ‰º¶‰∏éÈõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπÁöÑÂêà‰Ωú‰∏ç‰ªÖÈôê‰∫éÁêÜËÆ∫Êé¢ËÆ®ÔºåËøòÂèØËÉΩÊ∂âÂèäÂÆûÈôÖÁöÑÊäÄÊúØÂºÄÂèëÂíåÁ†îÁ©∂È°πÁõÆÔºåÊòæÁ§∫Âá∫‰ªñ‰ª¨Âú®Ê†∏Ê≠¶Âô®È¢ÜÂüüÁöÑ‰∏ì‰∏öËÉΩÂäõÂíåÂØπÊú™Êù•ÁßëÊäÄÂèëÂ±ïÁöÑÂÖ≥Ê≥®„ÄÇ\",52\r\n365,Ê≥∞Âãí,‰∏Å‰ª™,Ê≥∞ÂãíÂíå‰∏Å‰ª™Âú®È´òËÉΩÁ≤íÂ≠êÁ†îÁ©∂ÁöÑÂΩ±ÂìçÂèäÈù¢Â£ÅËÆ°ÂàíÁöÑÂøÖË¶ÅÊÄßÊñπÈù¢ËøõË°å‰∫ÜÊ∑±ÂÖ•ËÆ®ËÆ∫„ÄÇ‰ªñ‰ª¨Êé¢ËÆ®‰∫ÜËøô‰∏ÄÈ¢ÜÂüüÁöÑÊúÄÊñ∞ËøõÂ±ïÂèäÂÖ∂ÂØπÁßëÂ≠¶ÂíåÊäÄÊúØÁöÑÊΩúÂú®ÂΩ±Âìç„ÄÇÊ≠§Â§ñÔºåÊ≥∞Âãí‰∏é‰∏Å‰ª™ÂçöÂ£´Âú®Ëà™Â§©È£ûÊú∫‚Äú‰∫îÊúàËä±‚ÄùÂè∑ÁöÑ‰ªªÂä°‰∏≠‰πüÊúâÁõ¥Êé•ÁöÑ‰∫íÂä®ÔºåËøôË°®Êòé‰ªñ‰ª¨Âú®ÂÆûÈôÖÂ∫îÁî®‰∏≠ÂØÜÂàáÂêà‰ΩúÔºåÂÖ±ÂêåÊé®Âä®ÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÁöÑÂâçÊ≤ø„ÄÇÈÄöËøáËøô‰∫õ‰∫§ÊµÅ‰∏éÂêà‰ΩúÔºåÊ≥∞ÂãíÂíå‰∏Å‰ª™‰∏ç‰ªÖÂú®ÁêÜËÆ∫‰∏äÊé¢ËÆ®‰∫ÜÈ´òËÉΩÁ≤íÂ≠êÁ†îÁ©∂ÁöÑÈáçË¶ÅÊÄßÔºåËøòÂú®ÂÆûË∑µ‰∏≠ÁßØÊûÅÂèÇ‰∏éÁõ∏ÂÖ≥ÁöÑËà™Â§©‰ªªÂä°Ôºå‰ΩìÁé∞‰∫Ü‰ªñ‰ª¨Âú®ÁßëÂ≠¶Êé¢Á¥¢‰∏≠ÁöÑÈáçË¶ÅËßíËâ≤„ÄÇ,49\r\n244,ÂßîÂÜÖÁëûÊãâ,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπÈ¢ÜÂØºÂßîÂÜÖÁëûÊãâËøõË°åÂÜõ‰∫ãÂíåÁ§æ‰ºöÊîπÈù©ÔºåÊèêÂçáÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂÆûÂäõ,48\r\n345,Ê¥õÊñØÈòøÊãâËé´ÊñØÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂÆûÈ™åÂÆ§,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ,\"Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ is visiting Ê¥õÊñØÈòøÊãâËé´ÊñØÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂÆûÈ™åÂÆ§, which is a significant location for nuclear weapons simulation\",45\r\n536,PDCÁßëÂ≠¶È°æÈóÆÂõ¢,Â∏åÊÅ©ÊñØ,Â∏åÊÅ©ÊñØÂèÇ‰∏é‰∫ÜPDCÁßëÂ≠¶È°æÈóÆÂõ¢ÂØπËß£ÊûêÊëÑÂÉèÊú∫ÊäÄÊúØÁöÑÂèØË°åÊÄßÁ†îÁ©∂„ÄÇ,45\r\n724,Â∏åÊÅ©ÊñØ,Ëã±ÂõΩ,Â∏åÊÅ©ÊñØ‰∏éËã±ÂõΩ‰ª£Ë°®Âú®‰ºöËÆÆ‰∏äËÆ®ËÆ∫ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÊéßÂà∂ÁöÑËÆÆÊ°àÔºåÊòæÁ§∫Âá∫ÂØπËØ•ÈóÆÈ¢òÁöÑÂÖ±ÂêåÂÖ≥Ê≥®„ÄÇ,45\r\n735,Â∏åÊÅ©ÊñØ,Êó•Êú¨‰ª£Ë°®,Â∏åÊÅ©ÊñØ‰∏éÊó•Êú¨‰ª£Ë°®Âú®‰ºöËÆÆ‰∏≠ËÆ®ËÆ∫ÊÄùÊÉ≥Èí¢Âç∞ÁöÑÊÄßË¥®,45\r\n220,ÂùéÁâπ,Âè≤Âº∫,ÂùéÁâπ‰∏éÂè≤Âº∫ËÆ®ËÆ∫Ë°åÂä®ÁöÑÂÆâÂÖ®ÂíåÁéØËäÇÁÆÄÊ¥ÅÊÄßÔºåË°®Êòé‰ªñ‰ª¨‰πãÈó¥ÁöÑÂêà‰ΩúÂÖ≥Á≥ª„ÄÇ,43\r\n760,Ê∞¥ÊòüÂü∫Âú∞,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπÊèêÂá∫‰∫ÜÂú®Ê∞¥ÊòüÂª∫Á´ãÂü∫Âú∞ÁöÑËÆ°ÂàíÔºåÂº∫Ë∞ÉÂÖ∂ÈáçË¶ÅÊÄß„ÄÇ,43\r\n762,Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ,Ê≥ïÂõΩ,\"The entity \"\"Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ\"\" has been the subject of scrutiny from representatives of \"\"Ê≥ïÂõΩ.\"\" These representatives have expressed concerns regarding Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ's plans, suggesting that they are aligned with Èõ∑Ëø™‰∫öÂÖπ's character traits.
