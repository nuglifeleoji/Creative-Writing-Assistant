盔一个。廖化取盔捎在马上，一直望东追赶。原来司马懿把金盔弃于林东，却反向西走去了。廖化追了一程，不见踪迹，奔出谷口，遇见姜维，同回寨见孔明。张嶷早驱木牛流马到寨，交割已毕，获粮万余石。廖化献上金盔，录为头功。魏延心中不悦，口出怨言。孔明只做不知。\n\n    且说司马懿逃回寨中，心甚恼闷。忽使命赍诏至，言东吴三路入寇，朝廷正议命将抵敌，令懿等坚守勿战。懿受命已毕，深沟高垒，坚守不出。\n\n    却说曹睿闻孙权分兵三路而来，亦起兵三路迎之：令刘劭引兵救江夏，田豫引兵救襄阳，睿自与满宠率大军救合淝。满宠先引一军至巢湖口，望见东岸战船无数，旌旗整肃。宠入军中奏魏主曰：“吴人必轻我远来，未曾提备；今夜可乘虚劫其水寨，必得全胜。”魏主曰：“汝言正合朕意。”即令骁将张球领五千兵，各带火具，从湖口攻之；满宠引兵五千，从东岸攻之。是夜二更时分，张球、满宠各引军悄悄望湖口进发；将近水寨，一齐呐喊杀入。吴兵慌乱，不战而走；被魏军四下举火，烧毁战船、粮草、器具不计其数。诸葛瑾率败兵逃走沔口。魏兵大胜而回。\n\n    次日，哨军报知陆逊。逊集诸将议曰：“吾当作表申奏主上，请撤新城之围，以兵断魏军归路，吾率众攻其前：彼首尾不敌，一鼓可破也。”众服其言。陆逊即具表，遣一小校密地赍往新城。小校领命，赍着表文，行至渡口，不期被魏军伏路的捉住，解赴军中见魏主曹睿。睿搜出陆逊表文，览毕，叹曰：“东吴陆逊真妙算也！”遂命将吴卒监下，令刘劭谨防孙权后兵。却说诸葛瑾大败一阵，又值暑天，人马多生疾病；乃修书一封，令人转达陆逊，议欲撤兵还国。逊看书毕，谓来人曰：“拜上将军：吾自有主意。”使者回报诸葛瑾。瑾问：“陆将军作何举动？”使者曰：“但见陆将军催督众人于营外种豆菽，自与诸将在辕门射戏。”瑾大惊，亲自往陆逊营中，与逊相见，问曰：“今曹睿亲来，兵势甚盛，都督何以御之？”逊曰：“吾前遣人奉表于主上，不料为敌人所获。机谋既泄，彼必知备；与战无益，不如且退。已差人奉表约主上缓缓退兵矣。”瑾曰：“都督既有此意，即宜速退，何又迟延？”�\n######################\nOutput:",
