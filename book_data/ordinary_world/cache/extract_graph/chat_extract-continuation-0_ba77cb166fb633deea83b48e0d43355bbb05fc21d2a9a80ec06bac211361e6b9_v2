�军和爱云中午都不回家来，他自己也无心吃饭；于是就把这个小木匣装进一个破提包，又拿了一把挖炉灰的小铁铲，一个人静悄悄地出了门。 \n　　他踏着厚茸茸的积雪出了家属楼后边的小门，蹒跚着来到街道上。满天雪花象无数只纷飞的白蝴蝶。徐国强老汉脸绷得紧紧的，路上偶尔有认识他的人热情地给他打招呼，他只是严峻地点点头。 \n　　他到离地委不远处的一个小山沟里，在马路旁边瞅了个向阳的小山坡，用小铁铲在土崖根下掘个小洞，把那个小木匣放进去；然后用土掩埋起来，并且象真正的坟墓一样，弄起一个小土包。 \n　　殡葬全部结束后，他蹲在这个小土包旁边，又抽起了旱烟，雪花悄无声息地降落着，天地间一片寂静。他的双肩和栽绒棉帽很快白了。他痴呆呆地望着对面白皑皑的雪山和不远处的一大片建筑物，一缕白烟从嘴里喷出来，在头顶上的雪花间缭绕。 \n　　徐国强老汉突然感到这个世界空落落的；许多昨天还记忆犹新的事情，好象一下子变得很遥远了。这时候，他并不感到生命短促，反而觉得他活得太长久。 \n　　毫无疑问，老黑猫的死对徐国强老汉的打击是沉重的。只有他自己才能体验到这件事的残酷性。他也并不指望别人理解他，包括他家里的人。 \n　　几天来，他的情绪一直很低。他也不愿给别人叙说他的不幸。要是说出他为一只死去的猫而悲伤，也许别人会笑掉牙的。只是在星期天的饭桌上，爱云突然提念说：“这几天怎不见猫呢？” \n　　“猫已经死了。”他对女儿说。 \n　　“死了？也是的，这只猫太老了……”爱云轻淡地说了一句，然后便去盛汤。晓霞只顾低头吃饭，福军一边吃，一边和旁边的一位干部说话。谁也没有再说起这只死去的牲灵。 \n　　徐国强勉强吃了一小碗米饭，连汤也没喝，就回到了自己的房间。他木然地立在门后边，泪水盈满了一双昏花的老眼。他好象听见房间的什么地方传来“喵呜”一声叫唤，赶忙把脑袋转了一圈。一无所有，是他的耳朵产生了错觉……在以后的日子里，每过一两天，徐国强老汉总要在临近黄昏的时候，一个人悄然地走出家门，穿过那条街道，来到那个小山湾里，在那个小土包前徘徊一段时光。人的感情有时候真是不可思议，他也许对人是冷漠的，但可以对一个动物怀着永远的眷恋。 \n　　又是一个黄昏，城市的灯火和山坡\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>徐国强<|>PERSON<|>徐国强 is an elderly man mourning the death of his cat, feeling a
