\n　　他身上最重要的东西也许不是那个红布烟袋，而是用白线缀在前衣襟上的那个大衣袋。人各有爱好。田二有田二的爱好。田二最大的爱好，就是在村庄的各处和公路上转悠着，捡各种有用和无用的东西：铁丝头，废铁钉，烂布条，断麻绳，坏螺丝帽，破碗碴，碎纸片……捡到什么，就往这个大口袋里一装。这口袋经常鼓鼓囊囊；行走起来，里面叮当作响。他捡满一口袋，就倒在自家不铺席片的光土炕上。常年累月，除过父子俩睡觉的地方，他的土炕上已经堆满了这些破烂玩艺，连窗户都快要堵住了。他成天在村里转悠着，嘴角时常浮着一种不正常的微笑——这微笑看起来很神秘。他除过捡破烂，还爱凑到什么地方，说他那句“永恒的格言”——世事要变了！他不知在什么年代里学会了这句话，也已经不知说多少年了。除这话外，他很少说其它话。如果有个过路的陌生人碰见我们的田二，看见他那伟人似的额头，又听见他说出这样一句预言家式的高论，大概会大吃一惊的……现在，批判田二的人已经下了台，双水村小学院子里的批判会，看来也已经接近尾声了！ \n　　谢天谢地，打哈欠的人们终于听完了徐主任的批判总结。现在高虎正高举起拳头，带领大家呼口号。口号声中，“阶级敌人”已经一个个滚下了场。田二是本村人，因年纪太大，被革命宽恕免于“劳教”。他完成使命以后，也就没人管了。 \n　　宣布散会以后，众人立刻纷纷离场。住在田家圪崂那边的人，有的早提前溜了，现在已过了哭咽河的小桥，走到庙坪的枣树林里了。甚至有更早溜走的人，已经淌过了东拉河，上了公路，脚步声和人的嘈杂声，使这夜晚寂静的山村陷入到一片骚乱之中。全村的狗吠声彼起此伏。谁家的吃奶娃娃被惊醒了，哇哇地哭叫着，在这清冷的夜晚听起来叫人心慌意乱……赶快回家吧！瞌睡得抬不起眼皮的庄稼人，摇晃着疲劳的身躯，迷迷糊糊穿过村中交错的小路，纷纷回家去了…… \n　　小学院子里刹那间就一片空空荡荡了。学校下面的哭咽河，在残破的冰面下发出轻轻的呜咽声。 \n　　当孙玉亭收拾停当会场，最后一个离开学校的院子，走到土坡下面的时候，突然发现田二父子俩还立在哭\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
