烧了半锅热水，让他把满头的土垢洗干净，然后亲自拿那把破木梳给他把头发梳理了一下。少安一边照镜子，一边耍笑说：“你把我打扮成个新女婿了！” \n　　秀莲说：“等咱们有了自己的新窑，就再结婚一次！” \n　　秀莲的话使少安的心情沉重起来。是的，什么时候，他们才有自己的新窑呢？从他们结婚到现在，就一直住在饲养院的破窑洞里，但他又想，只要政策就这样宽下去，他有信心在这几年里给自己营造个新家。 \n　　两口子相跟着回到家里吃过早饭，少安就准备起身到石圪节去赶集。在他们回家之前，父亲已经吃过饭出去了——老人劳动心劲越来越大。 \n　　少安临起身前，他妈对他说：“你赶一回集，身上也不带几个钱，干脆把咱们刚摘下的老南瓜带几个卖了，你好花销……”少安想也是，大人倒没什么，但回来总得给虎子买点什么。 \n　　于是，他就在羊毛口袋里装了几个南瓜，扛在肩上去了石圪节。 \n　　石圪节的集市和往常不大相同了——庄稼人挤得脑袋插脑袋。大部分人都带着点什么，来这里换两个活钱，街道显然太小了，连东拉河的河道两边和附近的山坡上，都涌满了人。到处都是吆喝叫卖声。土街上空飘浮着庄稼人淌起的黄尘。 \n　　不时有一个穿花格衬衫、戴蛤蟆镜的青年人在人群中招摇而过，手里提的黑匣子象弹棉花似的响个不停，引得花百姓张大嘴巴看新奇。 \n　　孙少安挤到南街头食堂旁边的菜市场上，几个老南瓜不多时就卖了。 \n　　他把毛口袋卷夹在胳膊窝时，准备去给虎子买几毛钱的水果糖，给秀莲买一块揩汗的手帕，再拣绵软一点的吃食，给老祖母买一点。他的老南瓜卖了三块五毛八分钱，足够置办这些东西。如果还有剩余的话，他还准备给父亲买一块包头的羊肚子毛巾——他头上的那块已经肮脏得象从炭灰里捡出来似的。 \n　　孙少安正从南街的人群里挤的时候，突然感觉有人似乎拉扯他的衣服。他心一惊，以为是小偷——听说操这行当的人现在多起来了。 \n　　他赶忙回过头，才发现是他的同学刘根民。根民的手里提着个黑人造革提包，笑嘻嘻地对他说：“我从背影上就认出来是你！” \n　　少安问他：“你到哪里去呀？” \n　　“我刚下乡回来。走，跟我到公社去。我正准备捎话叫你来呢！现在走，我有事要给你说！” \n　　少安只好和根民一块挤过人群，跟他往公\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a character who is preparing to go to the market and is
