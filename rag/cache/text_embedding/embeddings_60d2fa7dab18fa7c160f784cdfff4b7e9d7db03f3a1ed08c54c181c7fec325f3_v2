enough data for a mentat computation? That was possible. And what if he said something to give her away? Would he do that if he shared her reason for being here? He must know their every movement, every word was being spied upon by Farad’n or his servants.\n“House Atreides has come to a bitter crossroads,” she said. “Family turned against itself. You were among my Duke’s most loyal men, Duncan. When the Baron Harkonnen\n“Let us not speak of Harkonnens,” he said. “That was another age and your Duke is dead.” And he wondered: Can’t she guess that Paul revealed the Harkonnen blood in the Atreides? What a risk that had been for Paul, but it had bound Duncan Idaho even more firmly to him. The trust in the revelation had been a coin almost too great to imagine. Paul had known what the Baron’s people had done to Idaho.\n“House Atreides is not dead,” Jessica said.\n“What is House Atreides?” he asked. “Are you House Atreides? Is it Alia? Ghanima? Is it the people who serve this House? | look at those people and they bear the stamp of a travail beyond words! How can they be Atreides? Your son said it rightly: ‘Travail and persecution are the lot of all who follow me.’ | would break myself away from that, My Lady.”\n“Have you really gone over to Farad’n?”\n“Isn't that what you’ve done, My Lady? Didn’t you come here to convince Farad’n that a marriage to Ghanima would solve all of our problems?”\nDoes he really think that? she wondered. Or is he talking for the watchful spies?\n“House Atreides has always been essentially an idea,” she said. “You know that, Duncan. We bought loyalty with loyalty.”\n“Service to the people,” Idaho sneered. “Ahhh, many’s the time I’ve heard your Duke say it. He must lie uneasy in his grave, My Lady.”\n“Do you really think us fallen that low?”\n“My lady, did you not know that there are Fremen rebels —they call themselves ‘Maquis of the Inner Desert’—who curse House Atreides and even Muad’Dib?”\n“| heard Farad’n’s report,” she said, wondering where he was leading this conversation and to what point.\n“More than that, My Lady. More than Farad’n’s report. I’ve heard their curse myself. Here’s the way of it: ‘Burning be on you, Atreides! You shall have no souls, nor spirits, nor bodies, nor shades nor magic nor bones, nor hair nor utterances nor words. You shall have no grave, nor house nor hole nor tomb. You shall have no garden, nor tree nor bush. You shall have no water, nor bread nor light nor fire. You shall have no children, nor family nor heirs nor tribe. You Shall have no head, nor arms nor legs nor gait nor seed. You Shall have no seats on any planet. Your souls shall not be permitted to come up from the depths, and they shall never be among those permitted to live upon the earth. On no day\nShall you behold Shai-Hulud, but you shall be bound and fettered in the nethermost abomination and your souls shall never enter into the glorious light for ever and ever.’ That’s the way of the curse, My Lady. Can you imagine such hatred from Fremen? They consign all Atreides to the left hand of the damned, to the Woman-Sun which is full of burning.”\nJessica allowed herself a shudder. Idaho undoubtedly had delivered those words with the same voice in which he’d heard the original curse. Why did he expose this to House Corrino? She could picture an outraged Fremen, terrible in his anger, standing before his tribe to vent that ancient curse. Why did Idaho want Farad’n to hear it?\n“You make a strong argument for the marriage of Ghanima and Farad’n,” she said.\n“You always did have a single-minded approach to problems,” he said. “Ghanima’s Fremen. She can marry only one who pays no fai, no tax for protection. House Corrino gave up its entire CHOAM holdings to your son and his heirs. Farad’n exists on Atreides sufferance. And remember when your Duke planted the Hawk flag on Arrakis, remember what he said: ‘Here | am; here | remain!’ His bones are still there. And Farad’n would have to live on Arrakis, his Sardaukar with him.”\nIdaho shook his head at the very thought of such an alliance.\n“There’s an old saying that one peels a problem like an onion,” she said, her voice cold. How dare he patronize me? Unless he’s performing for Farad’n’s watchful eyes...\n“Somehow, | can’t see Fremen and Sardaukar sharing a planet,” Idaho said. “That’s a layer which doesn’t come off the onion.”\nShe didn’t like the thoughts which Idaho’s words might arouse in Farad’n and his advisors, and spoke sharply: “House Atreides is still the law in this Empire!” And she thought: Does Idaho want Farad’n to believe he can regain the throne without the Atreides?\n“Oh, yes,” Idaho said. “I almost forgot. Atreides Law! As translated, of course, by the Priests of the Golden Elixir. | have but to close my eyes and | hear your Duke telling me that real estate is always gained and held by violence or the threat of it. Fortune passes everywhere, as Gurney used to sing it. The end justifies the means? Or do | have my proverbs mixed up? Well, it doesn’t matter whether the mailed fist is brandished openly by Fremen legions or Sardaukar, or whether it’s hidden in the Atreides Law—the fist is still there. And the onion layer won’t come off, My Lady. You know, | wonder which fist Farad’n will demand?”\nWhat is he doing? Jessica wondered. House Corrino would soak up this argument and gloat over it!\n“So you think the Priests wouldn’t let Ghanima marry Farad’n?” Jessica ventured, probing to see where Idaho’s words might be leading.\n“Let her? Gods below! The Priests will let Alia do whatever She decrees. She could marry Farad’n herself!”\nIs that where he’s fishing? Jessica wondered.\n“No, My Lady,” Idaho said. “That’s not the issue. This Empire’s people cannot distinguish between Atreides government and the government of Beast Rabban. Men die every day in Arrakeen’s dungeons. | left because | could not give my sword arm another hour to the Atreides! Don’t you understand what I’m saying, why | came here to you as the nearest Atreides representative? The Atreides Empire has betrayed your Duke and your son. | loved your daughter, but she went one way and I went another. If it comes down to it, l'Il advise Farad’n to accept Ghanima’s hand—or Alia’s—only on his own terms!”\nAhhh, he sets the stage for a formal withdrawal with honor from Atreides service, she thought. But these other matters of which he spoke, could he possibly know how well they did her work for her? She scowled at him. “You know spies are listening to every word, don’t you?”\n“Spies?” He chuckled. “They listen as | would listen in their place. Don’t you know how my loyalties move ina different way? Many’s the night I’ve spent alone in the desert, and the Fremen are right about that place. In the desert, especially at night, you encounter the dangers of hard thinking.”\n“Is that where you heard Fremen curse us?”\n“Yes. Among the al-Ourouba. At The Preacher’s bidding | joined them, My Lady. We call ourselves the Zarr Sadus, those who refuse to submit to the Priests. | am here to make formal announcement to an Atreides that I’ve removed myself to enemy territory.”\nJessica studied him, looking for betrayals of minutiae, but Idaho gave no indication that he spoke falsely or with hidden plans. Was it really possible that he’d gone over to Farad’n? She was reminded of her Sisterhood’s maxim: /n human affairs, nothing remains enduring; all human affairs revolve in a helix, moving around and out. If Idaho had really left the Atreides fold, that would explain his present behavior. He was moving around and out. She had to consider this as a possibility.\nBut why had he emphasized that he did The Preacher’s bidding?\nJessica’s mind raced and, having considered alternatives, she realized she might have to kill Idaho. The plan upon which she had staked her hopes remained so delicate that nothing could be allowed to interfere with it. Nothing. And Idaho’s words hinted that he knew her plan. She gauged their relative positions in the room, moving and turning to place herself in position for a lethal blow.\n“I’ve always considered the normalizing effect of the faufreluches to be a pillar of our strength,” she said. Let him wonder why she shifted their conversation to the system of class distinction. “The Landsraad Council of the Great Houses, the regional Sysselraads, all deserve our—”\n“You do not distract me,” he said.\nAnd Idaho wondered at how transparent her actions had become. Was it that she had grown lax in concealment, or had he finally breached the walls of her Bene Gesserit training? The latter, he decided, but some of it was in herself—a changing as she aged. It saddened him to see the Small ways the new Fremen differed from the old. The passing of the desert was the passing of something precious to humans and he could not describe this thing, no more than he could describe what had happened to the Lady Jessica.\nJessica stared at Idaho in open astonishment, not trying to conceal her reaction. Could he read her that easily?\n“You will not slay me,” he said. He used the Fremen words of warning: “Don’t throw your blood upon my knife.” And he thought: /’ve become very much the Fremen. It gave hima wry sense of continuity to realize how deeply he had accepted the ways of the planet which had harbored his second life.\n“I think you’d better leave,” she said.\n“Not until you accept my withdrawal from Atreides service.”\n“Accepted!” She bit it off. And only after she’d uttered the word did she realize how much pure reflex had gone into this exchange. She needed time to think and reconsider. How had Idaho known what she would do? She did not believe him capable of leaping Time in the spice way.\nIdaho backed away from her until he felt the door behind him. He bowed. “Once more | call you My Lady, and then never again. My advice to Farad’n will be to send you back to Wallach, quietly and quickly, at the earliest practical moment. You are too dangerous a toy to keep around. Although I don’t believe he thinks of you as a toy. You are working for the Sisterhood, not for the Atreides. | wonder now if you ever worked for the Atreides. You witches move too deeply and darkly for mere mortals ever to trust.”\n“A ghola considers himself a mere mortal,” she jibed.\n“Compared to you,” he said.\n“Leave!” she ordered.\n“Such is my intention.” He slipped out the door, passing the curious stare of the servant who'd obviously been listening.\nIt’s done, he thought. And they can read it in only one way.\n", " in the spice way.\nIdaho backed away from her until he felt the door behind him. He bowed. “Once more | call you My Lady, and then never again.

And they can read it in only one way.\nOnly in the realm of mathematics can you understand Muad’Dib’s precise view of the future. Thus: first, we postulate any number of point- dimensions in space. (This is the classic n-fold extended aggregate of n dimensions.) With this framework, Time as commonly understood becomes an aggregate of one-dimensional properties. Applying this to the Muad’Dib phenomenon, we find that we either are confronted by new properties of Time or (by reduction through the infinity calculus) we are dealing with separate systems which contain n body properties. For Muad’Dib, we assume the latter. As demonstrated by the reduction, the point dimensions of the n-fold can only have separate existence within different frameworks of Time. Separate dimensions of Time are thus demonstrated to coexist. This being the inescapable case, Muad’Dib’s predictions required that he perceive the n-fold not as extended aggregate but as an operation within a single framework. In effect, he froze his universe into that one framework which was his view of Time.\n—PALIMBASHA: LECTURES AT SIETCH TABR\n| lay at the crest of a dune, peering across open sand at a sinuous rock outcropping. The rock lay like an immense worm atop the sand, flat and threatening in the morning sunlight. Nothing stirred there. No bird circled overhead; no animal scampered among the rocks. He would see the slots of a windtrap almost at the center of the “worm’s” back. There’d be water here. The rock-worm held the familiar appearance of a sietch shelter, except for the absence of living things. He lay quietly, blending with sand, watching.\nOne of Gurney Halleck’s tunes kept flowing through his mind, monotonously persistent:\nBeneath the hill where the fox runs lightly, A dappled sun shines brightly\nWhere my one love’s still.\nBeneath the hill in the fennel brake\n| soy my love who cannot wake. He hides in a grave Beneath the hill.\nWhere was the entrance to that place? Leto wondered.\nHe felt the certainty that this must be Jacurutu/ Fondak, but there was something wrong here beyond the lack of animal movement. Something flickered at the edges of conscious perception, warning him.\nWhat hid beneath the hill?\nLack of animals was bothersome. It aroused his Fremen sense of caution: The absence says more than the presence when it comes to desert survival. But there was a windtrap. There would be water and humans to use it. This was the tabu place which hid behind Fondak’s name, its other identity lost even to the memories of most Fremen. And no birds or animals could be seen there.\nNo humans—yet here the Golden Path began.\nHis father had once said: “There’s unknown all around at every moment. That’s where you seek knowledge.”\nLeto glanced out to his right along the dunecrests. There’d been a mother storm recently. Lake Azrak, the gypsum plain, had been exposed from beneath its sandy cover. Fremen superstition said that whoever saw the Biyan, the White Lands, was granted a two-edged wish, a wish which might destroy you. Leto saw only a gypsum plain which told him that open water had existed once here on Arrakis.\nAs it would exist once more.\nHe peered upward, swinging his gaze all around in the search for movement. The sky was porous after the storm. Light passing through it generated a sensation of milky presence, of a silver sun lost somewhere above the dust veil which persisted in the high altitudes.\nOnce more Leto brought his attention back to the sinuous rock. He slipped the binoculars from his Fremkit, focused\ntheir motile lenses and peered at the naked greyness, this outcropping where once the men of Jacurutu had lived. Amplification revealed a thorn bush, the one called Queen of Night. The bush nestled in shadows at a cleft which might be an entrance into the old sietch. He scanned the length of the outcropping. The silver sun turned reds into grey, casting a diffuse flatness over the long expanse of rock.\nHe rolled over, turning his back on Jacurutu, scanned the circle of his surroundings through the binoculars. Nothing in that wilderness preserved the marks of human passage. The wind already had obliterated his tracks, leaving only a vague roundness where he had dropped from his worm in the night.\nAgain he looked at Jacurutu. Except for the windtrap, there was no sign that men had ever passed this way. And without that sinuous length of rock, there was nothing here to subtract from the bleached sand, a wilderness from horizon to horizon.\nLeto felt suddenly that he was in this place because he had refused to be confined in the system which his ancestors bequeathed him. He thought of how people looked at him, that universal mistake in every glance except Ghanima’s.\nExcept for that ragged mob of other memories, this child was never a Child.\nI must accept responsibility for the decision we made, he thought.\nOnce more he scanned the length of rock. By all the descriptions this had to be Fondak, and no other place could be Jacurutu. He felt a strange resonant relationship with the tabu of this place. In the Bene Gesserit Way, he opened his mind to Jacurutu, seeking to know nothing about it. Knowing was a barrier which prevented learning. For a few moments he allowed himself merely to resonate, making no demands, asking no questions.\nThe problem lay within the lack of animal life, but it was a particular thing which alerted him. He perceived it then: there were no scavenger birds—no eagles, no vultures, no hawks. Even when other life hid, these remained. Every watering place in this desert held its chain of life. At the end of the chain were the omnipresent scavengers. Nothing had come to investigate his presence. How well he knew the “watchdogs of the sietch,” that line of crouched birds on the cliff’s edge at Tabr, primitive undertakers waiting for flesh. As the Fremen said: “Our competitors.” But they said it with no sense of jealousy because questing birds often told when strangers approached.\nWhat if this Fondak has been abandoned even by the smugglers?\nLeto paused to drink from one of his catchtubes.\nWhat if there’s truly no water here?\nHe reviewed his position. He’d run two worms into the sand getting here, riding them with his flail through the night, leaving them half dead. This was the Inner Desert where the smugglers’ haven was to be found. If life existed here, if it cou/d exist, it would have to be in the presence of water.\nWhat if there’s no water? What if this isn’t Fondak/ Jacurutu?\nOnce more he aimed his binoculars at the windtrap. Its outer edges were sand-etched, in need of maintenance, but enough of it remained. There should be water.\nBut what if there isn’t?\nAn abandoned sietch might lose its water to the air, to any number of catastrophes. Why were there no scavenger birds? Killed for their water? By whom? How could all of them be eliminated? Poison?\nPoisoned water.\nThe legend of Jacurutu contained no story of the cistern poisoned, but it might have been. If the original flocks were slain, would they not have been renewed by this time? The\nIduali were wiped out generations ago and the stories never mentioned poison. Again he examined the rock with his binoculars. How could an entire sietch have been wiped out? Certainly some must have escaped. All of the inhabitants of a sietch were seldom at home. Parties roamed the desert, trekked to the towns.\nWith a sigh of resignation Leto put away his binoculars. He slipped down the hidden face of the dune, took extra care to dig in his stilltent and conceal all sign of his intrusion as he prepared to spend the hot hours. The sluggish currents of fatigue stole along his limbs as he sealed himself in the darkness. Within the tent’s sweaty confines he spent much of the day drowsing, imagining mistakes he could have made. His dreams were defensive, but there could be no self-defense in this trial he and Ghanima had chosen. Failure would scald their souls. He ate spice-biscuits and Slept, awakened to eat once more, to drink and return to Sleep. It had been a long journey to this place, a severe test for the muscles of a child.\nToward evening he awoke refreshed, listened for signs of life. He crept out of his sandy shroud. There was dust high up in the sky blowing one way, but he could feel sand stinging his cheek from another direction—sure sign there would be a weather change. He sensed a storm coming.\nCautiously he crept to the crest of his dune, peered once more at those enigmatic rocks. The intervening air was yellow. The signs spoke of a Coriolis storm approaching, the wind that carried death in its belly. There’d be a great winding sheet of wind-driven sand that might stretch across four degrees of latitude. The desolate emptiness of the gypsum pan was a yellow surface now, reflecting the dust clouds. The false peace of evening enfolded him. Then the day collapsed and it was night, the quick night of the Inner Desert. The rocks were transformed into angular peaks frosted by the light of First Moon. He felt sandthorns stinging his skin. A peal of dry thunder sounded like an echo from\ndistant drums and, in the space between moonlight and darkness he saw sudden movement: bats. He could hear the stirring of their wings, their tiny squeaks.\nBats.\nBy design or accident, this place conveyed a sense of abandoned desolation. It was where the half-legendary smuggler stronghold should be: Fondak. But what if it were not Fondak? What if the tabu still ruled and this were only the shell of ghostly Jacurutu?\nLeto crouched in the lee of his dune and waited for the night to settle into its own rhythms. Patience and caution— caution and patience. For a time he amused himself by reviewing Chaucer’s route from London to Canterbury, listing the places from Southwark: two miles to the watering-place of St. Thomas, five miles to Deptford, six miles to Greenwich, thirty miles to Rochester, forty miles to Sittingbourne, fifty-five miles to Boughton under Blean, fifty- eight miles to Harbledown, and sixty miles to Canterbury. It gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall Chaucer or know any London except the village on Gansireed. St. Thomas was preserved in the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar", " be: Fondak. But what if it were not Fondak? What if the tabu still ruled and this were only the shell of ghostly Jacurutu?\nLeto crouched in the lee of his dune and waited for the night to settle into its own rhythms. Patience and caution— caution and patience.

It gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall Chaucer or know any London except the village on Gansireed. St. Thomas was preserved in the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar Book, but Canterbury was gone from the memories of men, as was the planet which had known it. There lay the burden of his memories, of all those lives which threatened to engulf him. He had made that trip to Canterbury once.\nHis present trip was longer, though, and more dangerous.\nPresently he crept over the dune’s crest and made his way toward the moonlit rocks. He blended with shadows, slid across the crests, made no sounds that might signal his presence.\nThe dust had gone as it often did just before a storm, and the night was brilliant. The day had revealed no movement, but he heard small creatures hustling in the darkness as he neared the rocks.\nIn a valley between two dunes he came upon a family of jerboa which scampered away at his approach. He eased over the next crest, his emotions beset by salty anxieties. That cleft he had seen—did it lead up to an entrance? And there were other concerns: the old-time sietch had always been guarded by traps—poisoned barbs in pits, poisoned spines on plants. He felt himself caught up in the Fremen agrapha: The earminded night. And he listened for the Slightest sound.\nThe grey rocks towered above him now, made giant by his nearness. As he listened, he heard birds invisible in that cliff, the soft calling of winged prey. They were the sounds of daybirds, but abroad by night. What had turned their world around? Human predation?\nAbruptly Leto froze against the sand. There was fire on the cliff, a ballet of glittering and mysterious gems against the night’s black gauze, the sort of signal a sietch might send to wanderers across the bled. Who were these occupants of this place? He crept forward into the deepest shadows at the cliff’s base, felt along the rock with a hand, Sliding his body behind the hand as he sought the fissure he’d seen by daylight. He located it on his eighth step, slipped the sandsnorkel from his kit and probed the darkness. As he moved, something tight and binding dropped over his shoulders and arms, immobilizing him.\nTrapvine!\nHe resisted the urge to struggle; that only made the vine pull tighter. He dropped the snorkel, flexed the fingers of his right hand, trying for the knife at his waist. He felt like a bare innocent for not throwing something into that fissure from a distance, testing the darkness for its dangers. His mind had been too occupied by the fire on the cliff.\nEach movement tightened the trapvine, but his fingers at last touched the knife hilt. Stealthily, he closed his hand around the hilt, began to slip it free.\nFlaring light enveloped him, arresting all movement.\n“Ahhh, a fine catch in our net.” It was a heavy masculine voice from behind Leto, something vaguely familiar in the tone. Leto tried to turn his head, aware of the vine’s dangerous propensity to crush a body which moved too freely.\nA hand took his knife before he could see his captor. The hand moved expertly over his body, extracting the small devices he and Ghanima carried as a matter of survival. Nothing escaped the searcher, not even the shigawire garrote concealed in his hair.\nLeto still had not seen the man.\nFingers did something with the trapvine and he found he could breathe easier, but the man said: “Do not struggle, Leto Atreides. | have your water in my cup.”\nBy supreme effort Leto remained calm, said: “You know my name?”\n“Of course! When one baits a trap, it’s for a purpose. One aims for a specific quarry, not so?”\nLeto remained silent, but his thoughts whirled.\n“You feel betrayed!” the heavy voice said. Hands turned him around, gently but with an obvious show of strength. An adult male was telling the child what the odds were.\nLeto stared up into the glare from twin floater flares, saw the black outline of a stillsuit-masked face, the hood. As his eyes adjusted he made out a dark strip of skin, the utterly shadowed eyes of melange addiction.\n“You wonder why we went to all this trouble,” the man said. His voice issued from the shielded lower part of his face with a curious muffled quality, as though he tried to conceal an accent.\n“| long ago ceased to wonder at the numbers of people who want the Atreides twins dead,” Leto said. “Their reasons are obvious.”\nAs he spoke, Leto’s mind flung itself against the unknown as against a cage, questing wildly for answers. A baited trap? But who had known except Ghanima? Impossible!\nGhanima wouldn’t betray her own brother. Then did someone know him well enough to predict his actions? Who? His grandmother? How could she?\n“You could not be permitted to go on as you were,” the man said. “Very bad. Before ascending the throne, you need to be educated.” The whiteless eyes stared down at him. “You wonder how one could presume to educate such a person as yourself? You, with the knowledge of a multitude held there in your memories? That’s just it, you see! You think yourself educated, but all you are is a repository of dead lives. You don’t yet have a life of your own. You're just a walking surfeit of others, all with one goal—to seek death. Not good in a ruler, being a death seeker. You’d strew your Surroundings with corpses. Your father, for example, never understood the—”\n“You dare speak of him that way?”\n“Many’s the time I’ve dared it. He was only Paul Atreides, after all. Well, boy, welcome to your school.”\nThe man brought a hand from beneath his robe, touched Leto’s cheek. Leto felt the jolt of a slapshot and found himself winding downward into a darkness where a green flag waved. It was the green banner of the Atreides with its day and night symbols, its Dune staff which concealed a water tube. He heard the water gurgling as unconsciousness enfolded him. Or was it someone chuckling?\nWe can still remember the golden days before Heisenberg, who showed\nhumans the walls enclosing our predestined arguments. The lives within me find this amusing. Knowledge, you see, has no uses without purpose, but purpose is what builds enclosing walls.\n—LETO ATREIDES II HIS VOICE\nlia found herself speaking harshly to the guards she\nconfronted in the Temple foyer. There were nine of them in the dusty green uniforms of the suburban patrol, and they were still panting and sweating with their exertions. The light of late afternoon came in the door behind them. The area had been cleared of pilgrims.\n“So my orders mean nothing to you?” she demanded.\nAnd she wondered at her own anger, not trying to contain it but letting it run. Her body trembled with unleashed tensions. Idaho gone... the Lady Jessica...noreports... only rumors that they were on Salusa. Why hadn’t Idaho sent a message? What had he done? Had he learned finally about Javid?\nAlia wore the yellow of Arrakeen mourning, the color of the burning sun from Fremen history. In a few minutes she would be leading the second and final funeral procession to Old Gap, there to complete the stone marker for her lost nephew. The work would be completed in the night, fitting homage to one who'd been destined to lead Fremen.\nThe priestly guards appeared defiant in the face of her anger, not shamed at all. They stood in front of her, outlined by the waning light. The odor of their perspiration was easily detected through the light and inefficient stillsuits of city dwellers. Their leader, a tall blond Kaza with the bourka\nsymbols of the Cadelam family, flung his stillsuit mask aside to speak more clearly. His voice was full of the prideful intonations to be expected from a scion of the family which once had ruled at Sietch Abbir.\n“Certainly we tried to capture him!”\nThe man was obviously outraged at her attack. “He speaks blasohemy! We know your orders, but we heard him with our own ears!”\n“And you failed to catch him,” Alia said, her voice low and accusing.\nOne of the other guards, a short young woman, tried to defend them. “The crowds were thick there! | swear people interfered with us!”\n“We'll keep after him,” the Cadelam said. “We’ll not always fail.”\nAlia scowled. “Why won’t you understand and obey me?”\n“My Lady, we—”\n“What will you do, scion of the Cade Lamb, if you capture him and find him to be, in truth, my brother?”\nHe obviously did not hear her special emphasis on his name, although he could not be a priestly guard without some education and the wit to go with it. Did he want to sacrifice himself?\nThe guardsman swallowed, then: “We must kill him ourselves, for he breeds disorder.”\nThe others stood aghast at this, but still defiant. They knew what they had heard.\n“He calls upon the tribes to band against you,” the Cadelam said.\nAlia knew how to handle him now. She spoke in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone: “I see. Then if you must sacrifice yourself this way, taking him openly for all to see who you are and what you do, then | guess you must.”\n“Sacrifice my...” He broke off, glanced at his companions. As Kaza of this group, their appointed leader, he had the right to speak for them, but he showed signs\nthat he wished he’d remained silent. The other guards stirred uncomfortably. In the heat of the chase they’d defied Alia. One could only reflect now upon such defiance of the “Womb of Heaven.” With obvious discomfort the guards opened a small space between themselves and their Kaza.\n“For the good of the Church, our official reaction would have to be severe,” Alia said. “You understand that, don’t you?”\n“But he—”\n“I’ve heard him myself,” she said. “But this is a special case.”\n“He cannot be Muad’Dib, My Lady!”\nHow little you know! she thought. She said: “We cannot risk taking him in the open, harming him where others could see it. If another opportunity presents itself, of course.”\n“He’s always surrounded by crowds these days!”\n“Then | fear you must be patient. Of course, if you insist on defying me... .” She left the consequences hanging in the air, unspoken, but well understood. The Cadelam was ambitious, a shining career before him.\n“We didn’t mean defiance, My Lady.” The"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_60d2fa7dab18fa7c160f784cdfff4b7e9d7db03f3a1ed08c54c181c7fec325f3_v2"}
