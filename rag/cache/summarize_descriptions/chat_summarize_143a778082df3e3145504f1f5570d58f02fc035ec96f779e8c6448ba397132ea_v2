The Fremen are deeply tied to Dune’s harsh desert environment, which shapes their culture, traditions, and way of life. Their identity is inseparable from the planet, as their customs, survival techniques, and societal structures have evolved in response to Dune’s arid climate and scarce resources.  \n\nAcross all descriptions, the Fremen are consistently portrayed as native to Dune, with their existence and cultural practices intrinsically linked to the planet’s desert landscape. Whether referred to as \"indigenous,\" \"native inhabitants,\" or simply \"the people of Dune,\" the Fremen’s connection to their home is emphasized as fundamental to their identity. Their adaptation to Dune’s extreme conditions underscores their resilience and deep-rooted bond with the planet.  \n\nIn summary, the Fremen are the original and enduring inhabitants of Dune, with their culture, traditions, and survival strategies inextricably tied to the planet’s desert environment.
