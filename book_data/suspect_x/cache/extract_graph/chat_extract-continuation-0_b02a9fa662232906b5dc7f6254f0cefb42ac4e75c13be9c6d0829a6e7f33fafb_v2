Great deeds and foul ones have been done at the goading of sexual forces. We speak of ‘sexual strength’ and ‘sexual energies’ and such things as ‘the overmounting urge of desire.’ | don’t deny that such things are observable. But what we are looking at here is a force so powerful that it can destroy you and everything you hold worthwhile.”\n“That’s what I’m trying to understand. What is it the whores are doing wrong?”\n“They ignore the species at its work, Sheeana. | think you can already sense this. The Tyrant certainly knew about it. What was his Golden Path but a vision of sexual forces at work recreating humankind endlessly?”\n“And the whores don’t create?”\n“They mostly try to control their worlds with this force.”\n“They seem to be doing that.”\n“Ahhh, but what counterforces do they call forth?”\n“| don’t understand.”\n“You know about Voice and how it can control some people?”\n“But not control everybody.”\n“Exactly. A civilization subjected to Voice over a long period develops ways of adapting to this force, preventing manipulation by those who use Voice.”\n“So there are people who know how to resist the whores?”\n“We see unmistakable signs of it. And that is one of the reasons we are here on Rakis.”\n“Will the whores come here?”\n“I’m afraid so. They want to control the core of the Old Empire because they see us as an easy conquest.”\n“Aren't you afraid they'll win?”\n“They won't win, Sheeana. Depend on it. But they are good for us.”\n“How is that?”\nSheeana’s tone echoed Taraza’s own shock at hearing such words from Odrade. How much did Odrade suspect? In the next instant, Taraza understood and she wondered if the lesson was equally understandable to the young girl.\n“The core is static, Sheeana. We have been almost at a standstill for thousands of years. Life and movement are ‘out there’ with the people of the Scattering who resist the whores. Whatever we do, we must make that resistance even stronger.”\nThe sound of approaching ‘thopters broke Taraza from her reverie of remembrance. The VIOs were arriving from Keen. Still at some distance, but the sound carried far in the clear air.\nOdrade’s teaching method was a good one, Taraza had to admit as she scanned the sky for a first glimpse of the 'thopters. Apparently they were coming in low and from the other side of the building. That was the wrong direction but perhaps they had taken the VIOs on a short excursion over the remains of the Tyrant’s wall. Many people were curious about the place where Odrade had found the spice hoard.\nSheeana, Odrade, Waff, and Tulushan went back into the long meeting room. They had heard the 'thopters, too. Sheeana was anxious to show her power over the worms. Taraza hesitated. There was a laboring sound in the\napproaching ‘thopters. Were they overloaded? How many observers had they brought?\nThe first 'thopter lifted over the penthouse roof and Taraza saw the armored cockpit. She recognized treachery even before the first beam arced out of the machine, slicing through her legs below the knees. She fell heavily against a potted tree, her legs completely severed. Another beam slashed out at her, slicing at an angle across her hip. The ‘thopter swept over her in an abrupt roar of booster jets and banked away to the left.\nTaraza clung to the tree, shunting the agony aside. She managed to cut off most of the bloodflow from her wounds but the pain was great. Not as great as the spice agony, though, she reminded herself. That helped but she knew she was doomed. She heard shouts and the multiple sounds of violence all around the museum now.\n| have won! Taraza thought.\nOdrade darted from the penthouse and bent over Taraza. They said nothing but Odrade showed that she understood by putting her forehead to Taraza’s temple. It was the ages- old cue of the Bene Gesserit. Taraza began pouring her life into Odrade—Other Memories, hopes, fears... everything.\nOne of them might yet escape.\nSheeana watched from the penthouse, staying where she had been ordered to wait. She knew what was happening out there in the roof garden. This was the ultimate mystery of the Bene Gesserit and every postulant was aware of it.\nWaff and Tulushan, already out of the room when the attack came, did not return.\nSheeana shuddered with apprehension.\nAbruptly, Odrade stood and ran back into the penthouse. There was a wild look in her eyes but she moved with purpose. Leaping up, she gathered glowglobes, grabbing them in bundles by their toggle cords. She thrust several bundles into Sheeana’s hands and Sheeana felt her body grow lighter with the lift of the globes’ suspensor fields.\nTrailing more clusters of the globes beyond their field range, Odrade hurried across to the narrow end of the room where a grill in the wall indicated what she sought. With Sheeana’s help, she lifted the grill out of its slots, revealing a deep airshaft. The light of the clustered glowglobes showed rough walls inside.\n“Hold the globes close to get the maximum field effect,” Odrade said. “Push them away to lower yourself. In you go.”\nSheeana clutched the toggle cords in a sweaty hand and hopped over the sill. She let herself fall, then fearfully clutched the globes close. Light from above told her Odrade was following.\nAt the bottom, they emerged into a pump room, the susurrations of many fans a background for the sounds of violence from outside.\n“We must get to the no-room and then to the desert,” Odrade said. “All of these machinery systems are interconnected. There will be a passage.”\n“Is she dead?” Sheeana whispered.\n“Yes.”\n“Poor Mother Superior.”\n“I am the Mother Superior now, Sheeana. At least temporarily.” She pointed upward. “Those were the whores attacking us. We must hurry.”\nThe world is for the living. Who are they? We dared the dark to reach the white and warm. She was the wind when the wind was in my way.\nAlive at noon, | perished in her form. Who rise from the flesh to spirit know the fall: The word outleaps the world and light is all.\n—THEODORE ROETHKE (HISTORICAL QUOTATIONS: DAR-ES-BALAT)\nt required little conscious volition for Teg to become the\nwhirlwind. He had recognized at last the nature of the threat from the Honored Matres. Recognition fitted itself into the blurred requirements made upon him by the new Mentat awareness that went with his magnified speed.\nMonstrous threat required monstrous countermeasures. Blood spattered him as he drove himself through the headquarters building, slaughtering everyone he met.\nAs he had learned from his Bene Gesserit teachers, the great problem of the human universe lay in how you managed procreation. He could hear the voice of his first teacher as he carried destruction through the building.\n“You may think of this only as sexuality but we prefer the more basic term: procreation. It has many facets and offshoots and it has apparently unlimited energy. The emotion called ‘love’ is only one small aspect.”\nTeg crushed the throat of a man standing rigidly in his path and, at last, found the control room for the building’s defenses. Only one man was seated in it, his right hand almost touching a red key on the console in front of him.\nWith a slashing left hand, Teg almost decapitated the man. The body tipped backward in slow motion, blood welling from the gaping neck.\nThe Sisterhood ts right to call them whores!\nYou could drag humankind almost anywhere by manipulating the enormous energies of procreation. You could goad humans into actions they would never have believed possible. One of his teachers had said it directly:\n“This energy must have an outlet. Bottle it up and it becomes monstrously dangerous. Redirect it and it will sweep over anything in its path. This is an ultimate secret of all religions.”\nTeg was conscious of leaving more than fifty bodies behind him as he left the building. The last fatality was a soldier in camouflage uniform standing in the open doorway, apparently about to enter.\nAs he ran past apparently unmoving people and vehicles, Teg’s revved-up mind had time to reflect on what he had left behind him. Was there any consolation, he wondered, in the fact that the old Honored Matre’s last living expression was one of real surprise? Could he congratulate himself that Muzzafar would never again see his frame bush home?\nThe necessity for what he had accomplished in a few heartbeats was very clear, though, to one trained by the Bene Gesserit. Teg knew his history. There were many paradise planets in the Old Empire, probably many more among the people of the Scattering. Humans always seemed capable of trying that foolish experiment. People in such places mostly lazed along. A quick-smart analysis said this was because of the easy climates on such planets. He knew this for stupidity. It was because sexual energy was easily released in such places. Let the Missionaries of the Divided God or some denominational construct enter one of these paradises and you got outrageous violence.\n“We of the Sisterhood know,” one of Teg’s teachers had said. “We have put a flame to that fuse more than once with our Missionaria Protectiva.”\nTeg did not stop running until he was in an alley at least five kilometers from the abattoir that had been the\nheadquarters for the old Honored Matre. He knew that very little time had passed but there was something much more important upon which he had to focus. He had not killed every occupant of that building. There were eyes back there belonging to people who knew now what he could do. They had seen him kill Honored Matres. They had seen Muzzafar topple dead at his hands. The evidence of the bodies left behind and the slowed replay of recordings would tell it all.\nTeg leaned against a wall. Skin was torn from his left palm. He let himself return to normal time as he watched blood oozing from the wound. The blood was almost black.\nMore oxygen in my blood?\nHe was panting but not as much as these exertions would seem to require.\nWhat has happened to me?\nIt was something from his Atreides ancestry, he knew. Crisis had tipped him over into another dimension of human possibilities. Whatever the transformation, it was profound. He could see outward now into many necessities. And the people he had passed on his run to this alley had seemed like statues.\nWill | ever think of them as muck?\nIt could only happen if he let it happen, he knew. But the temptation was there and he allowed himself a brief commiseration for the Honored Matres. Great Temptation had toppled them into their own muck.\nWhat to do now?\nThe main line lay open to him. There was a man here in Ysai, one man who would be sure to know everyone Teg required. Teg looked around the alley. Yes, that man was near.\nThe fragrance of flowers and herbs wafted to Teg from somewhere down this alley. He moved toward this fragrance, aware that it led him where he needed to go and that no\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young girl being taught by Odrade and Taraza, showing potential power over worms and understanding Bene Gesserit mysteries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit who teaches Sheeana and becomes the temporary Mother Superior after Taraza's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit who is killed in an attack, transferring her memories to Odrade)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>Waff is a Tleilaxu present during the attack but does not return to help)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TULUSHAN<|>PERSON<|>Tulushan is another individual present during the attack but does not return to help)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with deep knowledge of human nature and procreation, involved in political and social manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a group referred to as 'whores' who attack the Bene Gesserit and seek control over the Old Empire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is the planet where the Bene Gesserit are located during the events described)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEEN<|>GEO<|>Keen is the location from which the VIOs are arriving)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YSAI<|>GEO<|>Ysai is the city where Teg is located after his attack on the Honored Matres)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTACK ON THE MUSEUM<|>EVENT<|>The attack on the museum by the Honored Matres results in Taraza's death and Odrade's escape with Sheeana)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG'S COUNTERATTACK<|>EVENT<|>Teg's violent counterattack against the Honored Matres in their headquarters building)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>ODRADE<|>Odrade is teaching Sheeana about Bene Gesserit mysteries and helps her escape<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TARAZA<|>Odrade receives Taraza's memories and becomes the temporary Mother Superior after her death<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a member of the Bene Gesserit and becomes the temporary Mother Superior<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres attack the Bene Gesserit, seeking control<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Teg counterattacks the Honored Matres, killing many in their headquarters<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg was trained by the Bene Gesserit and acts in their defense<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>TARAZA<|>Sheeana witnesses Taraza's death and understands the Bene Gesserit mysteries<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>TULUSHAN<|>Waff and Tulushan are present during the attack but do not return to help<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAKIS<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Bene Gesserit are located on Rakis during the events<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEEN<|>VIOs<|>The VIOs are arriving from Keen during the attack<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
