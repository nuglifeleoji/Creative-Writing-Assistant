“这个我也无法断言，不过或许能作为参考。能够证明两位在那天去了电影院当然是最好……后来您还有想起什么吗？”\n    “没有，上次能说的我都说了。”\n    “是吗？”岸谷瞥向室内。\n    “天气还是这么冷呢，府上每年都使用电暖桌吗？”\n    “你说暖桌？对……”靖子转头向后看，努力不让刑警察觉她的动摇，他会提起暖桌似乎不是偶然。\n    “您是从什么时候开始用这个暖桌的？”\n    “这个嘛……应该四、五年了吧。有什么不对吗？”\n    “不，没什么。”岸谷摇头，“对了，今天您下班后，又去了什么地方吗？因为您好像很晚才回来。”\n    这个出其不意的问题，令靖子大为狼狈，同时她也察觉刑警似乎一直在公寓前守着。如此说来，说不定也看到了她下计程车的那一幕。\n    不能扯拙劣的谎话，她想。\n    “我和朋友去吃饭了。”\n     她极力想用三言两语简短交代，但这样的答复显然无法说服刑警。\n    “是那位坐计程车送您回来的男士吧。是什么样的朋友？如果方便的话我想请教一下。”岸谷一脸抱歉的说。\n    “连这种事都非说不可吗？”\n    “我说过了，如果您方便的话。我知道这样很失礼，可是我如果不问就走，事后一定会被上司骂的很惨。我们绝不会骚扰对方，所以能否请您透露一下。”\n    靖子叹了一口大气。\n    “那是工藤先生。他以前常去我工作的店里捧场，发生命案之后，他怕我受到打击所以来看我。”\n    “请问他是做什么的？”\n    “听说他经营印刷公司，不过我不清楚详情。”\n    “您知道怎么联络他吗？”\n    岸谷的问题，令靖子再次皱眉，刑警看了拼命鞠躬哈腰。\n    “除非迫不得已，否则我们绝不会跟他联络，就算真有必要，我们也会尽量不冒犯他。”\n    靖子毫不掩饰不悦，默然取出自己的手机，连珠炮似的报出工藤给的号码。刑警连忙抄下来。\n    之后岸谷虽然满脸惶恐，还是针对工藤的事盘根究底地问了老半天。结果靖子只好连工藤第一次在“天亭”现身时的事也和盘托出。\n    岸谷走后，靖子锁上门，就一屁股跌坐在地。她觉得元气大伤、筋疲力尽。\n    传来纸门拉开的声音，美里从里屋出来了。\n    “看电影的事，他们好像还在怀疑什么。”她说，“一切果然都如石神先生所料。那个老师，实在太厉害了。”\n    “是啊。”靖子站起来，撩起刘海走回客厅。\n    “妈，你不是跟“天亭”的人去吃饭吗？”\n    被美里一问，靖子赫然抬起头，她看到女儿谴责的表情。\n    “你听见了？”\n    “�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
