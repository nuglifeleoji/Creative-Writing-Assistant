Somehow, | cannot see this in them, nor do | believe the Tyrant saw it.”\nWhen Rebecca started to reply, he stopped her with an upraised hand. “Mature humanity? That is their grail? Is it not the mature fruit that is plucked and eaten?”\nOn the floor of Junction’s Great Hall, Rebecca remembered these words, seeing the personification of them not in the lives she preserved but in the actions of her captors.\nGreat Honored Matre had finished eating. She wiped her hands on the gown of an attendant.\n“Let her approach,” Great Honored Matre said.\nPain lanced Rebecca’s left shoulder and she lurched forward on her knees. The one called Logno had come up behind with the stealth of a hunter and had jabbed a shuntgoad into the captive’s flesh.\nLaughter echoed through the room.\nRebecca staggered to her feet and, staying just ahead of the goad, arrived at the foot of the steps leading up to the Great Honored Matre where the goad stopped her.\n“Down!” Logno emphasized the command with another jab.\nRebecca sank to her knees and stared straight ahead at the risers of the steps. The yellow tiles displayed tiny scratches. Somehow, these flaws reassured her.\nGreat Honored Matre said: “Let her be, Logno. | wish answers, not screams.” Then to Rebecca: “Look at me, woman!”\nRebecca raised her eyes and stared up at the face of death. What an unremarkable face it was to have that threat in it. So ... so evenly featured. Almost plain. Such a small figure. This amplified the peril Rebecca sensed. What powers the small woman must have to rule these terrible people.\n“Do you know why you are here?” Great Honored Matre demanded.\nIn her most obsequious tones, Rebecca said: “I was told, O Great Honored Matre, that you wished me to recount the lore of Truthsay and other matters of Gammu.”\n“You were mated to a Truthsayer!” It was accusation.\n“He is dead, Great Honored Matre.”\n“No, Logno!” This was directed at the aide who lunged forward with the goad. “This wretch does not know our ways. Now, go stand at the side, Logno, where | will not be annoyed by your impetuosity.”\n“You will soeak to me only in response to questions or when | command it, wretch!” Great Honored Matre shouted.\nRebecca cringed.\nSpeaker whispered in Rebecca’s head: That was almost Voice. Be warned.\n“Have you ever known any of the ones who call themselves Bene Gesserit?” Great Honored Matre asked.\nReally now! “Everyone has encountered the witches, Great Honored Matre.”\n“What do you know of them?”\nSo this is why they brought me here.\n“Only what | have heard, Great Honored Matre.”\n“Are they brave?”\n“It is said they always try to avoid risks, Great Honored Matre.”\nYou are worthy of us, Rebecca. That is the pattern of these whores. The marble rolls down the incline in its proper channel. They think you dislike us.\n“Are these Bene Gesserit rich?” Great Honored Matre asked.\n“I think the witches are poor beside you, Honored Matre,” Rebecca said.\n“Why do you say that? Do not speak just to please me!”\n“But Honored Matre, could the witches send a great ship from Gammu to here just to carry me? And where are the witches now? They hide from you.”\n“Yes, where are they?” Honored Matre demanded.\nRebecca shrugged.\n“Were you on Gammu when the one they called Bashar fled us?” Honored Matre asked.\nShe knows you were. “| was there, Great Honored Matre, and heard the stories. | do not believe them.”\n“Believe what we tell you to believe, wretch! What are the stories you heard?”\n“That he moved with a speed the eye could not see. That he killed many .. . people with only his hands. That he stole a no-ship and fled into the Scattering.”\n“Believe that he fled, wretch.” See how she fears! She cannot hide the trembling.\n“Speak of the Truthsay,” Great Honored Matre commanded.\n“Great Honored Matre, | do not understand the Truthsay. | know only the words of my Sholem, my husband. | can repeat his words if you wish.”\nGreat Honored Matre considered this, glancing from side to side at her aides and councillors, who were beginning to show signs of boredom. Why doesn’t she just kill this wretch?\nRebecca, seeing the violence in eyes that glared orange at her, shrank into herself. She thought of her husband by his love-name, Shoel, now, and his words comforted. He had shown the “proper talent” while still a child. Some called it an instinct but Shoel had never used that word. “Trust your gut feelings. That’s what my teachers always said.”\nIt was such a down-to-earth expression that he said it usually threw off the ones who came seeking “the esoteric mystery.”\n“There is no secret,” Shoel had said. “It’s training and hard work like anything else. You exercise what they call ‘petit perception,’ the ability to detect very small variations in human reactions.”\nRebecca could see such small reactions in those who stared down at her. They want me dead. Why?\nSpeaker had advice. The great one likes to show off her power over the others. She does not do what others want but what she thinks they do not want.\n“Great Honored Matre,” Rebecca ventured, “you are so rich and powerful. Surely you must have a place of menial\nemployment where | may be of service to you.”\n“You wish to enter my service?” What a feral grin!\n“It would make me happy, Great Honored Matre.”\n“lam not here to make you happy.”\nLogno took a step forward onto the floor. “Then make us happy, Dama. Let us have some sport with—”\n“Silence!” Ahhh, that was a mistake, calling her by the intimate name here among the others.\nLogno drew back and almost dropped the goad.\nGreat Honored Matre stared down at Rebecca with an orange glare. “You will go back to your miserable existence on Gammu, wretch. | will not kill you. That would be a mercy. Having seen what we could give you, live your life without it.”\n“Great Honored Matre!” Logno protested. “We have Suspicions about—”\n“| have suspicions about you, Logno. Send her back and alive! Hear me? Do you think us incapable of finding her if we ever have need of her?”\n“No, Great Honored Matre.”\n“We are watching you, wretch,” Great Honored Matre said.\nBait! She thinks of you as something to capture larger game. How interesting. This one has a head and uses it in spite of her violent nature. So that’s how she came to power.\nAll the way back to Gammu, confined to stinking quarters in a ship that had once served the Guild, Rebecca considered her predicament. Surely, those whores had not expected her to mistake their intent. But... perhaps they did. Subservience, cringing. They revel in such things.\nShe knew this came from a bit of her Shoel’s Truthsay as much as from the Lampadas advisors.\n“You accumulate a lot of small observations, sensed but never brought to consciousness,” Shoel had said.\n“Cumulatively, they say things to you but not in a language anyone speaks. Language isn’t necessary.”\nShe had thought this one of the oddest things she had ever heard. But that was before her own Agony. In bed at night, comforted by darkness and the touch of loving flesh, they had acted wordlessly but had shared words, too.\n“Language obstructs you,” Shoel had said. “What you do is learn to read your own reactions. Sometimes, you can find words to describe this... sometimes... not.”\n“No words? Not even for the questions?”\n“Words you want, is it? How are these? Trust. Belief. Truth. Honesty.”\n“Those are good words, Shoel.”\n“But they miss the mark. Don’t depend on them.”\n“Then what do you depend on?”\n“My own internal reactions. | read myself, not the person in front of me. | always know a lie because | want to turn my back on the liar.”\n“So that’s how you do it!” Pounding his bare arm.\n“Others do it differently. One person | heard say she knew a lie because she wanted to put her arm through the liar’s arm and walk a ways, comforting the liar. You may think that’s nonsense, but it works.”\n“I think it’s very wise, Shoel.” Love speaking. She did not really know what he meant.\n“My precious love,” he said, cradling her head on his arm, “Truthsayers have a Truthsense that, once awakened, works all the time. Please don’t tell me I’m wise when it’s your love speaking.”\n“I’m sorry, Shoel.” She liked the smell of his arm and buried her head in the crook of it, tickling him. “But | want to know everything you know.”\nHe pushed her head into a more comfortable position. “You know what my Third Stage instructor said? ‘Know nothing! Learn to be totally naive.’”\nShe was astonished. “Nothing at all?”\n“You approach everything with a clean slate, nothing on you or in you. Whatever comes is written there by itself.”\nShe began to see it. “Nothing to interfere.”\n“Correct. You are the original ignorant savage, completely unsophisticated to the point where you back right into ultimate sophistication. You find it without looking for it, you might say.”\n“Now, that is wise, Shoel. l'Il bet you were the best student they ever had, the quickest and the—”\n“I thought it was interminable nonsense.”\n“You didn’t!”\n“Until one day | read a little twitch in me. It wasn’t the movement of a muscle or something someone else might detect. Justa. ..a twitch.”\n“Where was it?”\n“Nowhere I could describe. But my Fourth Stage instructor had prepared me for it. ‘Grab that thing with gentle hands. Delicately.” One of the students thought he meant your real hands. Oh, how we laughed.”\n“That was cruel.” She touched his cheek and felt the beginning of his dark stubble. It was late but she did not feel Sleepy.\n“I suppose it was cruel. But when the twitch came, | knew it. | had never felt such a thing before. | was surprised by it, too, because knowing it then, | knew it had been there all along. It was familiar. It was my Truthsense twitching.”\nShe thought she could feel Truthsense stirring within herself. The feeling of wonder in his voice aroused something.\n“It was mine then,” he said. “It belonged to me and | belonged to it. No separation ever again.”\n“How wonderful that must be.” Awe and envy in her voice.\n“No! Some of it | hate. Seeing some people this way is like seeing them eviscerated, their guts hanging out.”\n“That’s disgusting!”\n“Yes, but there are compensations, love. These are people you meet, people who are like beautiful flowers extended to you by an innocent child. Innocence. My own innocence responds and my Truthsense is strengthened. That is what you do\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>REBECCA<|>PERSON<|>Rebecca is a captive who is interrogated by the Great Honored Matre.
