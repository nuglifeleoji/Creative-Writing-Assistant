particular survival adaptations in its prey which, through the circular operation of feedback, produce changes in the predator which again change the prey—etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. ... Many powerful forces do the same thing. You can count religions among such forces.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\na (pes Lord has commanded me to tell you that your daughter lives.”\nNayla delivered the message to Moneo in a singsong voice, looking down across the workroom table at his figure seated there amidst a chaos of notes and papers and communications instruments.\nMoneo pressed his palms together firmly and looked down at the elongated shadow drawn on his table by late afternoon sunlight across the jeweled tree of his paperweight.\nWithout looking up at Nayla’s stocky figure standing at proper attention in front of him, he asked: “Both of them have returned to the Citadel?”\n“Yes.”\nMoneo looked out the window to his left, not really seeing the flinty borderline of darkness hanging on the Sareer’s horizon nor the greedy wind collecting sand grains from every dunetop.\n“That matter which we discussed earlier?” he asked.\n“It has been arranged.”\n“Very well.” He waved to dismiss her, but Nayla remained standing in front of him. Surprised, Moneo actually focused on her for the first time since she had entered.\n“Is it required that | personally attend this”—she swallowed—“wedding?”\n“The Lord Leto has commanded it. You will be the only one there armed with a lasgun. It is an honor.”\nShe remained in position, her gaze fixed somewhere over Moneo’s head.\n“Yes?” he prompted.\nNayla’s great lantern jaw worked convulsively, then: “He is God and | am mortal.” She turned on one heel and left the workroom.\nMoneo wondered vaguely what was bothering that hulking Fish Speaker, but his thoughts turned like a compass arrow to Siona.\nShe has survived as I did. Siona now had an inner sense which told her that the Golden Path remained unbroken. As / have. He found no sense of sharing in this, nothing to make him feel closer to his daughter. It was a burden and it would inevitably curb her rebellious nature. No Atreides could go against the Golden Path. Leto had seen to that!\nMoneo remembered his own rebel days. Every night a new bed and the constant urge to run. The cobwebs of his past clung to his mind, sticking there no matter how hard he tried to shake away troublesome memories.\nSiona has been caged. As | was caged. As poor Leto was caged.\nThe tolling of the nightfall bell intruded on his thoughts and activated his workroom’s lights. He looked down at the work still undone in preparation for the God Emperor’s wedding to Hwi Noree. So much work! Presently, he pressed a call-button and asked the Fish Speaker acolyte who appeared at the summons to bring him a tumbler of water and then call Duncan Idaho to the workroom.\nShe returned quickly with the water and placed the tumbler near his left hand on the table. He noted the long fingers, a lute-player’s fingers, but did not look up at her face.\n“I have sent someone for Idaho,” she said.\nHe nodded and went on with his work. He heard her leave and only then did he look up to drink the water.\nSome live lives like summer moths, he thought. But / have burdens without end.\nThe water tasted flat. It weighed down his senses, making his body feel torpid. He looked out at the sunset colors on the Sareer as they shaded away into darkness, thinking that he should recognize beauty in that familiar sense, but all he could think was that the light changed in its own patterns. /t is not moved by me at all.\nWith the full darkness, the light level of his workroom increased automatically, bringing a clarity of thought with it. He felt himself quite prepared for Idaho. This one had to be taught the necessities, and quickly.\nMoneo’s door opened, the acolyte again. “Will you eat now?”\n“Later.” He raised a hand as she started to leave. “I would like the door left open.”\nShe frowned.\n“You may practice your music,” he said. “I want to listen.”\nShe had a smooth, round, almost childlike face which became radiant when she smiled. The smile still on her lips, she turned away.\nPresently, he heard the sounds of a biwa lute in the outer office. Yes, that young acolyte had a talent. The bass strings were like rain drumming on a rooftop, a whisper of middle strings underneath. Perhaps she could move up to the baliset someday. He recognized the song: a deeply humming memory of autumn wind from some faraway planet where they had never known a desert. Sad music, pitiful music, yet marvellous.\nIt is the cry of the caged, he thought. The memory of freedom. This thought struck him as odd. Was it always the case that freedom required rebellion?\nThe lute fell silent. There came the sound of low voices. Idaho entered the workroom. Moneo watched him enter. A trick of light gave Idaho a face like a grimacing mask with pitted eyes. Without invitation, he sat down across from Moneo and the trickery was gone. Just another Duncan. He had changed into a plain black uniform without insignia.\n“I have been asking myself a peculiar question,” Idaho said. “I’m glad you summoned me. | want to ask this question of you. What is it, Moneo, that my predecessor did not learn?”\nStiff with surprise, Moneo sat up straight. What an un- Duncan question! Could there be a peculiar Tleilaxu difference in this one after all?\n“What prompts this question?” Moneo asked.\n“I’ve been thinking like a Fremen.”\n“You weren't a Fremen.”\n“Closer to it than you think. Stilgar the Naib once said | was probably born Fremen without knowing it until | came to Dune.”\n“What happens when you think like a Fremen?”\n“You remember that you should never be in company that you wouldn’t want to die with.”\nMoneo put his hands palms down on the surface of his table. A wolfish smile came over Idaho’s face.\n“Then what are you doing here?” Moneo asked.\n“I suspect that you may be good company, Moneo. And | ask myself why Leto would choose you as his closest companion.”\n“I passed the test.”\n“The same one your daughter passed?”\nSo he has heard they are back. It meant some of the Fish\nSpeakers were reporting things to him... unless the God Emperor had summoned the Duncan. ... No, I would have heard.\n“The tests are never identical,” Moneo said. “I was made to go alone into a cavern maze with nothing but a bag of\nfood and a vial of spice-essence.”\n“Which did you choose?”\n“What? Oh... if you are tested, you will learn.”\n“There’s a Leto | don’t know,” Idaho said.\n“Have I not told you this?”\n“And there’s a Leto you don’t know,” Idaho said.\n“Because he’s the loneliest person this universe has ever seen,” Moneo said.\n“Don’t play mood games trying to arouse my sympathy,” Idaho said.\n“Mood games, yes. That’s very good,” Moneo nodded. “The God Emperor’s moods are like a river—smooth where nothing obstructs him, foaming and violent at the least suggestion of a barrier. He is not to be obstructed.”\nIdaho looked around at the brightly lighted workroom, turned his gaze to the outside darkness and thought about the tamed course of the /daho River somewhere out there. Bringing his attention back to Moneo, he asked: “What do you know of rivers?”\n“In my youth, I traveled for him. | have even trusted my life to a floating shell of a vessel on a river and then ona sea whose shores were lost in the crossing.”\nAs he spoke, Moneo felt that he had brushed against a clue to some deep truth in the Lord Leto. The sensation dropped Moneo into reverie, thinking of that far planet where he had crossed a sea from one shore to another. There had been a storm on the first evening of that passage and, somewhere deep within the ship, an irritating non- directional “sug-sug-sug-sug-sug” of laboring engines. He had stood on deck with the captain. His mind had kept focusing on the engine sound, retreating and coming back to it like the oversurging of the watery green-black mountains which passed and came, repeating and repeating. Each down crash of the keel opened the sea’s flesh like a fist smashing. It was insane motion, a sodden Shaking, up... up, down! His lungs had ached with\nrepressed fear. The lunging of the ship and the sea trying to put them down—wild explosions of solid water, hour after hour, white blisters of water spilling off the decks, then another sea and another...\nAll of this was a clue to the God Emperor.\nHe is both the storm and the ship.\nMoneo focused on Idaho seated across the table from him in the workroom’s cold light. Not a tremor in the man, but a hungering was there.\n“So you will not help me learn what the other Duncan Idahos did not learn,” Idaho said.\n“But | will help you.”\n“Then what have | always failed to learn?”\n“How to trust.”\nIdaho pushed himself back from the table and glared at Moneo. When Idaho’s voice came, it was harsh and rasping: “I'd say | trusted too much.”\nMoneo was implacable. “But how do you trust?”\n“What do you mean?”\nMoneo put his hands in his lap. “You choose male companions for their ability to fight and die on the side of right as you see it. You choose females who can complement this masculine view of yourself. You allow for no differences which can come from good will.”\nSomething moved in the doorway to Moneo’s workroom. He looked up in time to see Siona enter. She stopped, one hand on her hip.\n“Well, father, up to your old tricks, | see.”\nIdaho jerked around to stare at the speaker.\nMoneo studied her, looking for signs of the change. She had bathed and put on a fresh uniform, the black and gold of Fish Speaker command, but her face and hands still betrayed the evidence of her desert ordeal. She had lost weight and her cheekbones stood out. Unguent did little to conceal cracks in her lips. Veins stood out on her hands. Her\neyes looked ancient and her expression was that of someone who had tasted bitter dregs.\n“I’ve been listening to you two,” she said. She dropped her hand from her hip and moved farther into the room. “How dare you speak of good will, father?”\nIdaho had noted the uniform. He pursed his lips in thought. Fish Speaker Command? Siona?\n“| understand your bitterness,” Moneo said. “I had similar feelings once.”\n“Did you really?” She came closer, stopping just beside Idaho, who continued to regard her with a look of speculation.\n“lam filled with joy to see you alive,” Moneo said.\n“How gratifying for you to see me safely into the God Emperor’s Service,” she said. “You waited", " face and hands still betrayed the evidence of her desert ordeal.

See how successful | am.” She turned slowly to display her uniform. “Commander of the Fish Speakers. A commander with a troop of one, but nonetheless a commander.”\nMoneo forced his voice to be cold and professional. “Sit down.”\n“| prefer to stand.” She looked down at Idaho’s upturned face. “Ahhh, Duncan Idaho, my intended mate. Don’t you find this interesting, Duncan? The Lord Leto tells me | will be fitted into the command structure of the Fish Speakers in time. Meanwhile, | have one attendant. Do you know the one called Nayla, Duncan?”\nIdaho nodded.\n“Really? | think perhaps | don’t know her.” Siona looked at Moneo. “Do | know her, father?”\nMoneo shrugged.\n“But you speak of trust, father,” Siona said. “Who does the powerful minister, Moneo, trust?”\nIdaho turned to see the effect of these words on the majordomo. The man’s face appeared brittle with repressed emotion. Anger? No... something else.\n“I trust the God Emperor,” Moneo said. “And, in the hope that it will teach both of you something, | am here to convey his wishes to you.”\n“His wishes!” Siona taunted. “Hear that, Duncan? The God Emperor’s commands are now wishes.”\n“Speak your piece,” Idaho said. “I know we have little choice in whatever it is.”\n“You always have a choice,” Moneo said.\n“Don’t listen to him,” Siona said. “He’s full of tricks. They expect us to fall into each other’s arms and breed more like my father. Your descendant, my father!”\nMoneo’s face went pale. He gripped the edge of his worktable with both hands and leaned forward. “You are both fools! But | will try to save you. In spite of yourselves, | will try to save you.”\nIdaho saw Moneo’s cheeks tremble, the intensity of the man’s stare, and felt oddly moved by this. “I’m not his stud, but l'Il listen to you.”\n“Always a mistake,” Siona said.\n“Be still, woman,” Idaho said.\nShe glared at the top of Idaho’s head. “Don’t address me that way or l'Il wrap your neck around your ankles!”\nIdaho stiffened and started to turn.\nMoneo grimaced and waved a hand for Idaho to remain seated. “I caution you, Duncan, that she could probably do it. |I am no match for her and you do recall your attempt at violence against me?”\nIdaho inhaled a deep, quick breath, let it out slowly, then: “Say what you have to Say.”\nSiona moved to perch at the end of Moneo’s table and looked down at both of them. “Much better,” she said. “Let him have his say, but don’t listen.”\nIdaho pressed his lips tightly together.\nMoneo released his grip on the edge of his desk. He sat back and looked from Idaho to Siona. “I have almost completed the arrangements for the God Emperor’s\nwedding to Hwi Noree. During those festivities, | want you both out of the way.”\nSiona turned a questioning look on Moneo. “Your idea or his?”\n“Mine!” Moneo returned his daughter’s glare. “Have you no sense of honor and duty? Have you learned nothing from being with him?”\n“Oh, | learned what you learned, father. And | gave my word, which | will keep.”\n“Then you'll command the Fish Speakers?”\n“Whenever he trusts me with command. You know, father, he’s ever so much more devious than you are.”\n“Where are you sending us?” Idaho asked.\n“Provided we agree to go,” Siona said.\n“There is a small village of Museum Fremen at the edge of the Sareer,” Moneo said. “It is called Tuono. The village is relatively pleasant. It’s in the shadow of the Wall with the river just beyond the Wall. There is a well and the food is good.”\nTuono? Idaho wondered. The name sounded familiar. “There was a Tuono Basin on the way to Sietch Tabr,” he said.\n“And the nights are long and there’s no entertainment,” Siona said.\nIdaho shot a sharp glance at her. She returned it. “He wants us breeding and the Worm satisfied,” she said. “He wants babies in my belly, new lives to warp and twist. I'll see him dead before I'll give him that!”\nIdaho looked back at Moneo with a bemused expression. “And if we refuse to go?”\n“I think you’ll go,” Moneo said.\nSiona’s lips twitched. “Duncan, have you even seen one of these little desert villages? No comforts, no...”\n“I have seen Tabur Village,” Idaho said.\n“I’m sure that is a metropolis beside Tuono. Our God Emperor would not celebrate his nuptials in any cluster of\nmud hovels! Oh, no. Tuono will be mud hovels and no amenities, as close to the original Fremen as possible.”\nIdaho kept his attention on Moneo while speaking: “Fremen did not live in mud huts.”\n“Who cares where they conducted their cultish games?” she sneered.\nStill looking at Moneo, Idaho said: “Real Fremen had only one cult, the cult of personal honesty. | worry more about honesty than about comfort.”\n“Don’t expect comfort from me!” Siona snapped.\n“| don’t expect anything from you,” Idaho said. “When would we leave for this Tuono, Moneo?”\n“You're going?” she asked.\n“lam considering an acceptance of your father’s kindness,” Idaho said.\n“Kindness!” She looked from Idaho to Moneo.\n“You would leave immediately,” Moneo said. “I have detailed a detachment of Fish Speakers under Nayla to escort you and provide for you at Tuono.”\n“Nayla?” Siona asked. “Really? Will she stay with us there?”\n“Until the day of the wedding.”\nSiona nodded slowly. “Then we accept.”\n“Accept for yourself!” Idaho snapped.\nSiona smiled. “Sorry. May | formally request that the great Duncan Idaho join me at this primitive garrison where he will keep his hands off my person?”\nIdaho peered up at her from under his brows. “Have no fears about where | will put my hands.” He looked at Moneo. “Are you being kind, Moneo? Is that why you’re sending me away?”\n“It’s a question of trust,” Siona said. “Who does he trust?”\n“Will | be forced to go with your daughter?” Idaho insisted.\nSiona stood. “We either accept or the troopers will bind us and carry us out in a most uncomfortable fashion. You can\nsee it in his face.”\n“So | really have no choice,” Idaho said.\n“You have the choice anyone has,” Siona said. “Die now or later.”\nStill, Idaho stared at Moneo. “Your real intentions, Moneo? Won't you satisfy my curiosity?”\n“Curiosity has kept many people alive when all else failed,” Moneo said. “I am trying to keep you alive, Duncan. | have never done that before.”\nIt required almost a thousand years before the dust of Dune’s old planet- wide desert left the atmosphere to be bound up in soil and water. The wind called sandblaster has not been seen on Arrakis for some twenty-five hundred years. Twenty billion tons of dust could be carried suspended in the wind of just one of those storms. The sky often had a silvery look to it then. Fremen said: “The desert is a surgeon cutting away the skin to expose what’s underneath.” The planet and the people had layers. You could see them. My Sareer is but a weak echo of what was. | must be the sandblaster today.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nae os sent them to Tuono without consulting me? How surprising of you, Moneo! You’ve not done such an independent thing in a long while.”\nMoneo stood about ten paces from Leto in the gloomy center of the crypt, head bowed, using every artifice he knew to keep from trembling, aware that even this could be seen and interpreted by the God Emperor. It was almost midnight. Leto had kept his majordomo waiting and waiting.\n“| pray | have not offended my Lord,” Moneo said.\n“You have amused me, but take no heart from that. Lately, | cannot separate the comic from the sad.”\n“Forgive me, Lord,” Moneo whispered.\n“What is this forgiveness you ask? Must you always require judgment? Can’t your universe merely be?”\nMoneo lifted his gaze to that awful cowled face. He is both ship and storm. The sunset exists in itself. Moneo felt that he stood on the brink of terrifying revelations. The God Emperor’s eyes bored into him, burning, probing. “Lord, what would you have of me?”\n“That you have faith in yourself.”\nFeeling that something might explode in him, Moneo said: “Then the fact that | did not consult you before .. .”\n“How enlightened of you, Moneo! Small souls who seek power over others first destroy the faith those others might have in themselves.”\nThe words were shattering to Moneo. He sensed accusation in them, confession. He felt his hold on a fearsome but infinitely desirable thing weakening. He tried to find words to call it back, but his mind remained blank. Perhaps if he asked the God Emperor...\n“Lord, if you would but tell me your thoughts on...”\n“My thoughts vanish on contact!”\nLeto stared down at Moneo. How strange were the majordomo’s eyes perched there above that hawkish Atreides nose—free-verse eyes in a metronome face. Did Moneo hear that rhythmic pulsebeat: Malky is coming! Malky is coming! Malky is coming!?\nMoneo wanted to cry out in anguish. The thing he had felt —all gone! He put both his hands over his mouth.\n“Your universe is a two-dimensional hourglass,” Leto accused. “Why do you try to hold back the sand?”\nMoneo lowered his hands and sighed. “Do you wish to hear about the wedding arrangements, Lord?”\n“Don’t be tiresome! Where is Hwi?”\n“The Fish Speakers are preparing her for...”\n“Have you consulted her about the arrangements?”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“She approved?”\n“Yes, Lord, but she accused me of living for the quantity of", "\nLeto stared down at Moneo.

Does she see the unrest among the Fish Speakers?”\n“I think so, Lord.”\n“The idea of my marriage disturbs them.”\n“It’s why | sent the Duncan away, Lord.”\n“Of course it is, and Siona with him to...”\n“Lord, | Know you have tested her and she...”\n“She senses the Golden Path as deeply as you do, Moneo.”\n“Then why do | fear her, Lord?”\n“Because you raise reason above all else.”\n“But | do not know the reason for my fear!”\nLeto smiled. This was like playing bubble dice in an infinite bowl. Moneo’s emotions were a marvelous play performed only on this stage. How near the edge he walked without ever seeing it!\n“Moneo, why do you insist on taking pieces out of the continuum?” Leto asked. “When you see a spectrum, do you desire one color there above all the others?”\n“Lord, | don’t understand you!”\nLeto closed his eyes, remembering the countless times he had heard this cry. The faces were an unseparated blend. He opened his eyes to erase them.\n“As long as one human remains alive to see them, the colors will not suffer a linear mortis even if you die, Moneo.”\n“What is this thing of colors, Lord?”\n“The continuum, the neverending, the Golden Path.”\n“But you see things which we do not, Lord!”\n“Because you refuse!”\nMoneo sank his chin to his chest. “Lord, | know you have evolved beyond the rest of us. That is why we worship you and...”\n“Damn you, Moneo!”\nMoneo jerked his head up and stared at Leto in terror.\n“Civilizations collapse when their powers outrun their religions!” Leto said. “Why can’t you see this? Hwi does.”\n“She is Ixian, Lord. Perhaps she...”\n“She’s a Fish Speaker! She has been from birth, born to serve me. No!” Leto raised one of his tiny hands as Moneo tried to speak. “The Fish Speakers are disturbed because | called them my brides, and now they see a stranger not trained in Siaynog who knows it better than they.”\n“How can that be, Lord, when your Fish...”\n“What are you saying? Each of us comes into being knowing who he is and what he is supposed to do.”\nMoneo opened his mouth but closed it without speaking. “Small children know,” Leto said. “It’s only after adults have confused them that children hide this knowledge even\nfrom themselves. Moneo! Uncover yourself!”\n“Lord, | cannot!” The words were torn from Moneo. He trembled with anguish. “I do not have your powers, your knowledge of...”\n“Enough!”\nMoneo fell silent. His body shook.\nLeto spoke soothingly to him. “It’s all right, Moneo. | asked too much of you and | can see your fatigue.”\nSlowly, Moneo’s trembling subsided. He drew in deep, gulping breaths.\nLeto said: “There will be some change in my Fremen wedding. We will not use the water rings of my sister, Ghanima. We will use, instead, the rings of my mother.”\n“The Lady Chani, Lord? But where are her rings?”\nLeto twisted his bulk on the cart and pointed to the intersection of two cavernous spokes on his left where the dim light revealed the earliest burial niches of the Atreides on Arrakis. “In her tomb, the first niche. You will remove those rings, Moneo, and bring them to the ceremony.”\nMoneo stared across the gloomy distance of the crypt. “Lord... is it not a desecration to...”\n“You forget, Moneo, who lives in me.” He spoke then in Chani’s voice: “I can do what | want with my water rings!”\nMoneo cowered. “Yes, Lord. | will bring them with me to Tabur Village when...”\n“Tabur Village?” Leto asked in his usual voice. “But | have changed my mind. We will be wed at Tuono Village!”\nMost civilization is based on cowardice. It’s so easy to civilize by teaching cowardice. You water down the standards which would lead to bravery. You restrain the will. You regulate the appetites. You fence in the horizons. You make a law for every movement. You deny the existence of chaos. You teach even the children to breathe slowly. You tame.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho stood aghast at his first close glimpse of Tuono\nVillage. That was the home of Fremen?\nThe Fish Speaker troop had taken them from the Citadel at daybreak, Idaho and Siona bundled into a large ornithopter, accompanied by two smaller guard ships. And the flight had been slow, almost three hours. They had landed at a flat, round plastone hangar almost a kilometer from the village, separated from it by old dunes locked in Shape with plantings of poverty grasses and a few scrubby bushes. As they came down, the wall directly behind the village had seemed to grow taller and taller, the village shrinking beneath such immensity.\n“The Museum Fremen are kept generally uncontaminated by off-planet technology,” Nayla had explained as the escort sealed the ’thopters into the low hangar. One of the troop already had been sent trotting off toward Tuono with the announcement of their arrival.\nSiona had remained mostly silent all during the flight, but she had studied Nayla with covert intensity.\nFor a time during the march across the morning-lighted dunes, Idaho had tried to imagine that he was back in the old days. Sand was visible in the plantings and, in the valleys between dunes, there was parched ground, yellow grass, the sticklike shrubs. Three vultures, their gap-tipped\nwings spread wide, circled in the vault of sky—“ the soaring search,” Fremen had called it. Idaho had tried to explain this to Siona walking beside him. You worried about the carrion- eaters only when they began to descend.\n“I have been told about vultures,” she said, her voice cold.\nIdaho had noted the perspiration on her upper lip. There was a Spicy smell of sweat in the troop pressed close around them.\nHis imagination was not equal to the task of defocusing the differences between the past and this time. The issue stillsuits they wore were more for show than for efficient collection of the body’s water. No true Fremen would have trusted his life to one of them, not even here, where the air smelled of nearby water. And the Fish Speakers of Nayla’s troop did not walk in Fremen silence. They chattered among themselves like children.\nSiona trudged beside him in sullen withdrawal, her attention frequently on the broad muscular back of Nayla, who strode along a few paces ahead of the troop.\nWhat was between those two women? Idaho wondered. Nayla appeared devoted to Siona, hanging on Siona’s every word, obeying every whim Siona uttered... except that Nayla would not deviate from the orders which brought them to Tuono Village. Still, Nayla deferred to Siona and called her “Commander.” There was something deep between those two, something which aroused awe and fear in Nayla.\nThey came at last to a slope which dropped down to the village and the wall behind it. From the air, Tuono had been a cluster of glittering rectangles just outside the shadow of the wall. From this close vantage, though, it had been reduced to a cluster of decaying huts made even more pitiful by attempts to decorate the place. Bits of shiny minerals and scraps of metal picked out scroll designs on the building walls. A tattered green banner fluttered from a\nmetal pole atop the largest structure. A fitful breeze brought the smell of garbage and uncovered cesspools to Idaho’s nostrils. The central street of the village extended out across the sparsely planted sand toward the troop, ending in a ragged edge of broken paving.\nA robed delegation waited near the building of the green flag, standing there expectantly with the Fish Speaker messenger Nayla had sent on ahead. Idaho counted eight in the delegation, all men in what appeared to be authentic Fremen robes of dark brown. A green headband could be glimpsed beneath the hood on one of the delegation—the Naib, no doubt. Children waited to one side with flowers. Black-hooded women could be seen peering from side- streets in the background. Idaho found the whole scene distressing.\n“Let’s get it over with,” Siona said.\nNayla nodded and led the way down the slope onto the street. Siona and Idaho stayed a few paces behind her. The rest of the troop straggled along after them, silent now and peering around with undisguised curiosity.\nAs Nayla neared the delegation, the one with the green headband stepped forward and bowed. He moved like an old man but Idaho saw that he was not old, barely into his middle years, the cheeks smooth and unwrinkled, a stubby nose with no scars from breath-filter tubes, and the eyes! The eyes revealed definite pupils, not the all-blue of spice addiction. They were brown eyes. Brown eyes in a Fremen!\n“lam Garun,” the man said as Nayla stopped in front of him. “I am Naib of this place. | give you a Fremen welcome to Tuono.”\nNayla gestured over her shoulder at Siona and Idaho, who had stopped just behind her. “Are quarters prepared for your guests?”\n“We Fremen are noted for our hospitality,” Garun said. “All is ready.”\nIdaho sniffed at the sour smells and sounds of this place. He glanced through open windows of the flag-topped building on his right. The Atreides banner flying over that? The window opened into an auditorium with a low ceiling, a bandshell at the far end enclosing a small platform. He saw rows of seats, maroon carpeting on the floor. It had all the look of a stage setting, a place to entertain tourists.\nThe sound of shuffling feet brought Idaho’s attention back to Garun. Children were pressing forward around the delegation, extending clumps of garish red flowers in their grimy hands. The flowers were wilted.\nGarun addressed himself to Siona, correctly identifying the gold piping of Fish Speaker Command in her uniform.\n“Will you wish a performance of our Fremen rituals?” he asked. “The music, perhaps? The dance?”\nNayla accepted a bunch of flowers from one of the children, sniffed them and sneezed.\n"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_bd3a11ab3fedc4432167d7e7db09be608750bededf3199a10b8b170e70c24bb7_v2"}
