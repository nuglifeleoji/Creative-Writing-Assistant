她写的几首诗，对她的写诗才能给予极高的评价，并且答应在《山丹丹》上接连用头条位置发她的几组诗；说一定要把她推向全国去！ \n　　杜丽丽兴奋得神魂颠倒。她把古风铃比作她的“启明星”。两个人立刻成了相互高度理解的知音。一个晚上的半夜时分，古风铃敲开了杜丽丽的房门，丽丽丝毫没有拒绝，两个人就在黄原宾馆睡到了一块。 \n　　几个晚上的云来雾去，杜丽丽就彻底爱上了古风铃。 \n　　这一天中午，杜丽丽正和古风铃在她房间的床边上抱在一起亲吻，听见有人敲门。两个人赶紧分开。古风铃坐在沙发上，丽丽前去开门。 \n　　丽丽打开门，看见是她的丈夫武惠良。 \n　　一直等到惠良手里提着洗澡的东西和换洗衣服走进来后，杜丽丽才想起她原先约好让惠良中午来这里洗澡。 \n　　丽丽有点慌张地介绍古风铃和惠良认识。两个男人握了握手。古风铃搪塞了几句，就过他房间去了。武惠良先坐进了沙发。 \n　　丽丽为了使自己平静下来，钻进卫生间替丈夫收拾澡盆去了。 \n　　武惠良虽说是个行政领导，但也读了不少书，因此头脑极其聪慧。他一进来，就感觉这房子里有一种令人疑惑的气氛。他发现妻子和那个怪模怪样的诗人，脸上的神色都很不自然，丈夫对妻子的敏感几乎要胜过雷达对空中飞行物的敏感。 \n　　但是，没有什么直接的证据来证实他的猜疑是有道理的。不过，他相信他的直觉。没有错！在他妻子和刚离开的那个人之间，已经发生了一些不可言传的事！ \n　　卫生间的水在哗哗地响着，看来那个澡盆还得收拾一段时间！ \n　　是的，丽丽得让自己平静下来，恢复到一种“正常”状态才露面，卫生间成了掩饰她的庇护所。 \n　　他要不要现在立刻走进去？ \n　　不！这样反而会降低了他自己的人格。 \n　　武惠良呆呆地坐在沙发里，手里还提着换洗的内衣。他内心狂涛骤起，思维在闪电般排除或肯定各种可能和不可能。他多么希望一切都是他的错觉啊！ \n　　但是，他在无意间却找到了该死的“证据”。他看见，那个平展展的床铺边上，竟有两个挨得很近的塌陷的窝。这分明是两个人一块坐过的地方！ \n　　武惠良感到两眼一阵发黑。 \n　　他索性闭住眼仰靠在沙发背上，困难地咽了一口唾沫。 \n　　“都好了，你快去洗吧。”他听见妻子在说话。他睁开眼，没有马上起来。 \n　　“你怎啦\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>杜丽丽<|>PERSON<|>杜丽丽 is a poet who is excited about her
