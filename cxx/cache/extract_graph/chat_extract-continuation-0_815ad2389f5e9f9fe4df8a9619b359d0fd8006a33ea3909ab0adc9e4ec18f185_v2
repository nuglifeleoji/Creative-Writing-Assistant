日本航空自卫队的战斗机，相当于美国防卫其本土战斗机的总和。而且，九十年代大量引进的空中加油机，使F15J的作战半径扩大了一倍，使日本的空中战斗力远超过保卫本土的需要，跻身于空中强国的行列。\n　　那么这把利剑的在新星纪元的继承者是什么样的人呢？现在，日本孩子除了像别国的孩子一样努力恢复经济外，还在以惊人的速度组建军队，目前日本组建的孩子军队的数量尚不明确，但肯定大大超过了前自卫队的人数。这时的日本列岛已成了一座大兵营，到处都可以看见高唱着《拨刀曲》进行队列训练的男孩子，他们有的装备着真正的步兵轻武器，有的只是扛着木枪木棒，华华和小梦从电视中看到的那个雪仗场面就是其中之一。戴维从电视新闻中看到的一个场面更加惊人，那新闻是从太平洋上空的美国通讯卫星转发过来的。电视中首先出现了日本广岛的那尊著名的塑像。广岛曾有一个在核袭击中染上放射病的小女孩，在医院中经常叠纸鸢玩。一位女护士安慰她：当她叠够一千只纸鸢时，病就会好。女孩以后每天都埋头叠着一只又一只纸鸢，终于叠够了一千只，但她还是死了。后来在广岛立了一座塑像：一个女孩高举着一只大纸鸢。后来塑像的脚下经常有孩子们献上的纸鸢。现在，那些纸鸢堆得高高的，像女孩脚下的一堆洁白的雪。这情景戴维本来是熟悉的，但觉得那些纸鸢有些异样，仔细一看，那哪是什么纸鸢，是无数架纸叠的战斗机！不断有孩子把叠好的战斗机向塑像掷去，那些纸飞机像白色的幽灵一样在小女孩儿的周围上下翻飞，并在她脚下越堆越高，迟早要把她埋住……\n　　军国主义的幽灵已飞出了靖国神社，日本孩子不再甘心像爸爸妈妈们那样呆在那一串贫瘠的大岛之上，他们向世界复仇的战争已不可避免。\n　　日本孩子虽然令戴维心神不安，但说到底他并不怕同日本再打一次太平洋战争。如果日本孩子敢于向美国宣战，美国那庞大的战争机器将立刻开动起来，那些现在空谈和平的美国孩子将全力支持战争，就像六十多年前珍珠港事件发生时那样。戴维甚至想过诱使日本孩子进攻美国，以使美国孩子接受战争，从而达到急剧扩军的目的。他有把握打败日本孩子，自卫队留下来的装备固然不少，但同美军的武库相比就微不足道了。战端一开，美国孩子根本不需要像大人们六十年前那样同日本人在太平洋上苦战，只需\n######################\nOutput:",
