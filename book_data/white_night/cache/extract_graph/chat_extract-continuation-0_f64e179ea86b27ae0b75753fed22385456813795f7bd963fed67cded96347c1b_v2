�宫之中，我们也不知道接下来会遇到多少对手。如果同时遇到两组人呢？我们是班里最强的，万一他们围攻我们怎么办?大家实力虽有差距，但也没差太多。所以，还是缓一缓，以保持最佳状态，这样，遇到什么情况都好处理。”\n\n    “嗯，听剑逸的。我们要保证能拿到最终的冠军。”吕千寻做出了正确选择。他能够成为高能少年班班长，可不仅仅是因为实力。\n\n    叶灵瞳虽然有些心不甘情不愿，但还是点了点头：“咦，那边有一堆石头，还是死胡同，就去那边好了。”\n\n    吕千寻和常剑逸顺着她手指的方向看去，果然，在他们所在的这个路口的一端，有一堆石头在那里。\n\n    “嗯，就去那边。”\n\n    石堆后。\n\n    蓝轩宇、钱磊和刘锋三人面面相觑。他们距离十字路口并不远，吕千寻三人的谈话他们当然都听到了。这是什么运气？\n\n    躲着都能遇到全班最强的对手……\n\n    虽然刘锋和钱磊现在对自己很有信心，或者说对蓝轩宇很有信心，可是，那毕竟是吕千寻啊，魂力接近二十级，比他们高了可不止一点，更何况他们组还有叶灵瞳和常剑逸。\n\n    三对三，有点悬。\n\n    可是，对方三人已经朝这边走过来了，而且是很警惕地走过来了。\n\n    怎么办?\n\n    蓝轩宇深吸一口气，双手食指向钱磊勾勒出一扇门的形状，示意他开始召唤，同时向身边的刘锋点了点头。\n\n    金纹蓝银草和银纹蓝银草同时释放，反卷覆盖双手。\n\n    躲不过，就只有战斗了！\n\n    钱磊不敢迟疑，立刻释放出自己的召唤金钱，开始召唤。召唤之门再次出现，蓝轩宇左手抓住门框，辅助他召唤。\n\n    另一边，刘锋也释放出了自己的白龙枪，在蓝轩宇的增幅下，龙眸明召唤完成，吕千寻三人也已经走近了。\n\n    就在这时，召唤之门内，传来一个熟悉又清脆的声音。\n\n    “没空！”\n\n    蓝轩宇、刘锋和钱磊三人瞬间石化。而石堆另一边的吕千寻、叶灵瞳和常剑逸自然也听到了这个声音，三人的脚步立刻停了下来。\n\n    没空…….居然没空……\n\n    毫无疑问，这声音来自冻千秋。还有什么比召唤出二十级以上的冻千秋更稳妥吗?四对三，他们还是有极大的把握战胜吕千寻三人的。\n\n    可是，冻千秋这一声“没空”，让他们的希望破灭了。别说是偷袭了，\n\n    他们甚至还直接暴露了。而且，没能召唤成功，也意味着，钱磊起不到什么作用了。\n\n    计划中的四对三，立刻就变成了二对三。\n\n
