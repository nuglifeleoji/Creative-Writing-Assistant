The organization plays a crucial role in coordinating military actions and strategies among member states, as well as overseeing significant projects such as the Wallfacer Project, which involves the management of the 面壁法案 (Wallfacer legislation) to ensure the privileges of the Wallfacers in formulating and executing their plans.\n\nThe United Nations is also engaged in discussions and negotiations regarding pressing global threats, including the Trisolaran presence, and has passed resolutions addressing critical issues, such as resolution 117, which classifies escapeism as a crime against humanity. The organization is responsible for the supervision and control of the operations of the 思想钢印 (Thought Steel Stamp) and ensures strict oversight during its use.\n\nIn times of crisis, the United Nations takes action involving legal and resource management, and it has been involved in the preparation of peace negotiations with fleets. The organization is dedicated to maintaining international peace and security, and it coordinates global affairs, including proposals for technological public ownership.\n\nThe United Nations has also been recognized for its historical significance, such as receiving a sculpture titled \"\"铸剑为犁\"\" (Turning Swords into Plowshares) from the former Soviet government. Additionally, it has conferred the title of Wallfacer upon individuals like 罗辑 (Luo Ji), who has sought to engage with the UN through video systems and has previously declined missions assigned to him.\n\nDespite its many responsibilities, the United Nations has faced criticism, including accusations of being responsible for the release of 雷迪亚兹 (Radiance).
