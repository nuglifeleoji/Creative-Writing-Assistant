This expertise also places Kynes in a position of strategic importance, as seen in their role in blocking escape routes for House Atreides during conflicts on the planet.  \n\nDespite their profound connection to Arrakis, Kynes ultimately dies on the planet, underscoring their inextricable bond with its environment.
