\n　　领导们即刻在刘志英和登云的引导下，在主宾席上落了坐。登云把亲家介绍给领导们时田福堂慌得抖着胳膊和众位领导们握手。李登云同时硬把老首长徐国强也拉到了这桌上。 \n　　不一时，徐爱云就带着新娘新郎进来了。餐厅里立刻掀起一阵欢愉的喧哗和骚乱。有些爱开玩笑的年轻人都不由自主地喊叫起来了。 \n　　特邀司仪马国雄宣布婚礼开始。为了给李登云带面子而亲自担任主婚人的冯世宽，即席发表了简短而热情的祝福词，勉励两个新人继承毛主席的遗志，在革命大道上携手并进…… \n　　接着餐厅里就响起了一阵乒乒乓乓的碰杯声和吆喝声，整个大厅顿时象一锅煮沸了的水一般开始喧腾了……田润叶低着头，和李向前并排坐在主宾席前面的两把椅子上。她感到头晕目眩，甚至不知道自己身在何地。命运啊，多么无情！这不是婚礼，而是她青春的葬礼……她低倾着头，两只眼睛微微闭合着。她在这一片嗡嗡的嘈杂声中，仿佛又听见了那亲切而熟悉的声音从远方传来…… \n　　此刻，她那页想象的白帆又驶回了遥远的童年，在记忆中的每一个温暖的港湾里停泊了一下。她想起在双水村解冻的阳土坡上，她和少安用肮脏的小手一块刨“蛮蛮草”吃；想起夏日里的东拉河，水流一片碧澄，她和少安浑身不挂一条线，嬉闹着互相往光身子上糊泥巴；秋天的神仙山崖畔上缀满一串串红艳艳的酸枣，少安哥赤脚爬上去，给她搞了那么多；冬天虽然寒冷而荒凉，但他们心里热乎乎的，手拉着手走过东拉河的冰面，穿过庙坪落光了叶子的枣树林，跨过哭咽河上的小桥，在金家湾的草丛里寻找那些破碎的瓷片。是的，破碎。一切都破碎了……“让路！油啊……” \n　　“六的六呀，五魁手……” \n　　“喝！” \n　　“吃！好好吃！” \n　　“夹菜！” \n　　“咦呀，哈哈哈……” \n　　………… \n　　在这一片洪水般喧嚣的声音之上，她似乎又听见了那令人心碎的信天游—— \n　　正月里冻冰呀立春消，二月里鱼儿水上漂，水呀上漂来想起我的哥！ \n　　想起我的哥哥， \n　　想起我的哥哥， \n　　想起我的哥哥呀你等一等我…… \n
