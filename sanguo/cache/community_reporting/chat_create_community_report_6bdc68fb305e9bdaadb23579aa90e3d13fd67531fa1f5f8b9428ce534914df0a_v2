He ascended to the throne as the son of Sun Xiu, adopting the era name Yuanxing. His reign was marked by a combination of ambition and controversy, as he sought to expand Wu's territory and restore its former glory. However, his rule is often characterized by tyrannical governance and poor administration, which led to significant discontent among his subjects.\n\nThroughout his reign,孙皓 was particularly concerned about the military actions of the Jin dynasty, which posed a significant threat to his kingdom. Despite his ambitions, his inability to effectively manage the state and respond to external pressures ultimately culminated in his surrender to the Jin dynasty, marking the end of Eastern Wu's sovereignty. This surrender not only signified the fall of his rule but also the dissolution of the Eastern Wu kingdom itself, which had been a significant player in the power dynamics of the Three Kingdoms era.\n\nIn summary, 孙皓's legacy is a complex one, reflecting both his aspirations for expansion and the harsh realities of his tyrannical rule, which ultimately led to the downfall of Eastern Wu.\",27\n3031,建业,\"建业, known as the capital city of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period, played a crucial role in the political and military landscape of the time.
