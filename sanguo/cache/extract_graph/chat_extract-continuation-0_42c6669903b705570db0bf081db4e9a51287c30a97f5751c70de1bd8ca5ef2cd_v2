起一妇人尸首，虽然日久，其尸不烂：宫样装束，项下带一锦囊。取开看时，内有朱红小匣，用金锁锁着。启视之，乃一玉玺：方圆四寸，上镌五龙交纽；傍缺一角，以黄金镶之；上有篆文八字云：“受命于天，既寿永昌。”坚得玺，乃问程普。普曰：“此传国玺也。此玉是昔日卞和于荆山之下，见凤凰栖于石上，载而进之楚文王。解之，果得玉。秦二十六年，令良工琢为玺，李斯篆此八字于其上。二十八年，始皇巡狩至洞庭湖。风浪大作，舟将覆，急投玉玺于湖而止。至三十六年，始皇巡狩至华阴，有人持玺遮道，与从者曰：‘持此还祖龙。’言讫不见，此玺复归于秦。明年，始皇崩。后来子婴将玉玺献与汉高祖。后至王莽篡逆，孝元皇太后将玺打王寻、苏献，崩其一角，以金镶之。光武得此宝于宜阳，传位至今。近闻十常侍作乱，劫少帝出北邙，回宫失此宝。今天授主公，必有登九五之分。此处不可久留，宜速回江东，别图大事。”坚曰：“汝言正合吾意。明日便当托疾辞归。”商议已定，密谕军士勿得泄漏。\n\n
