These beings possess unique physiological characteristics and abilities that allow them to adapt to harsh natural environments. Originating from the Trisolaran world, they are intelligent life forms that communicate with the universe through listening stations.\n\nThe Trisolaran civilization is advanced, with a technology level that can be compared to that of Earth. However, their societal structure is notably different; they do not tolerate idleness within their community. Individuals who lose their ability to work are subjected to a process known as \"\"dehydration,\"\" which is a form of enforced removal from society. The lifespan of a Trisolaran is typically between 700,000 to 800,000 Trisolaran years, indicating a vastly different temporal perception compared to humans.\n\nIn summary, the 三体人 are a complex and formidable species from the Trisolaran world, characterized by their adaptability, advanced technology, and a strict societal framework that prioritizes productivity and efficiency. Their impending interaction with humanity poses a critical challenge, as they bring with them not only their technological prowess but also a fundamentally different worldview shaped by their unique biological and social characteristics.\",11\r\n530,低频电波,低频电波是三体人监测的信号，可能来自远距离的高功率发射源或近距离的低功率发射源。,2\r\n586,地球人,地球人是指生活在地球上的人类，他们与三体人进行技术水平的比较。,2\r\n587,蝗虫,蝗虫是指一种昆虫，地球人正在与其进行长期的灭绝战争。,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n768,三体人,1379号监听站,三体人通过1379号监听站接收和发送宇宙信息,16\r\n777,三体人,低频电波,三体人监测低频电波以寻找外星生命的迹象。,13\r\n869,地球人,三体人,地球人与三体人之间存在技术水平的比较，地球人认为与蝗虫的技术差距更大。,13\r\n870,地球人,蝗虫,地球人与蝗虫之间存在长期的灭绝战争。,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
