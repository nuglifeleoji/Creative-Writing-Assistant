The sweet bitterness of Tleilaxu smells drifted on the air coming in his window. Waff inhaled deeply and closed his window.\nHe felt renewed by his moment of solitary observation. Turning away from the window, he donned the white khilat\nrobe of honor to which all Domel were conditioned to bow. The robe completely covered his short body, giving him the distinct feeling that it actually was armor.\nThe armor of God!\n“We are the people of the Yaghist,” he had reminded his councillors only last night. “All else is frontier. We have fostered the myth of our weakness and evil practices for these millennia with only one purpose. Even the Bene Gesserit believe!”\nSeated in the deep, windowless sagra with its no- chamber shield, his nine councillors had smiled in silent appreciation of his words. In the judgment of the ghufran, they knew. The stage upon which the Tleilaxu determined their own destiny had always been the kehl with its right of ghufran.\nIt was proper that even Waff, the most powerful of all Tleilaxu, could not leave his world and be readmitted without abasing himself in the ghufran, begging pardon for contact with the unimaginable sins of aliens. To go out among the powindah could soil even the mightiest. The khasadars who policed all Tleilaxu frontiers and guarded the selamliks of the women were right to suspect even Waff. He was of the people and the kehl, yes, but he must prove it each time he left the heartland and returned, and certainly every time he entered the selamlik for the distribution of his sperm.\nWaff crossed to his long mirror and inspected himself and his robe. To the powindahs, he knew, he appeared an elfin figure barely a meter and a half tall. Eyes, hair, and skin were shades of gray, all a stage for the oval face with its tiny mouth and line of sharp teeth. A Face Dancer might mimic his features and pose, might dissemble at a Masheikh’s command, but no Masheikh or khasadar would be fooled. Only the powindahs would be gulled.\nExcept for the Bene Gesserit!\nThis thought brought a scowl to his face. Well, the witches had yet to encounter one of the new Face Dancers.\nNo other people have mastered the genetic language as well as have the Bene Tleilax, he reassured himself. We are right to call it “the language of God,” for God Himself has given us this great power.\nWaff strode to his door and waited for the morning bell. There was no way, he thought, to describe the richness of emotion he felt now. Time unfolded for him. He did not ask why the Prophet’s true message had been heard only by the Bene Tleilax. It had been God’s doing and, in that, the Prophet had been the Arm of God, worthy of respect as God’s Messenger.\nYou prepared them for us, O Prophet.\nAnd the ghola on Gammu, this ghola at this time, was worth all of the waiting.\nThe morning bell sounded and Waff strode out into the hall, turned with other emerging white-robed figures and went onto the eastern balcony to greet the sun. As the Mahai and Abdi of his people, he now could identify himself with all Tleilaxu.\nWe are the legalists of the Shariat, the last of our kind in the universe.\nNowhere outside the sealed chambers of his malik- brothers could he reveal such a secret thought but he knew it was a thought shared in every mind around him now, and the workings of that thought were visible in Masheikh, Domel and Face Dancer alike. The paradox of kinship ties and a sense of social identity that permeated the khel from Masheikh down to the lowliest Domel was not a paradox to Waff.\nWe work for the same God.\nA Face Dancer in the guise of Domel had bowed and opened the balcony doors. Waff, emerging into sunlight with his many companions close around, smiled at recognition of the Face Dancer. A Domel yet! It was a kin-joke but Face\nDancers were not kin. They were constructs, tools, just as the ghola on Gammu was a tool, all designed with the language of God spoken only by Masheikhs.\nWith the others who pressed close around him Waff made obeisance to the sun. He uttered the cry of the Abdl and heard it echoed by countless voices from the farthest reaches of the city.\n“The sun is not God!” he shouted.\nNo, the sun was only a symbol of God's infinite powers and mercy—another construct, another tool. Feeling cleansed by his passage through the ghufran the previous night, renewed by the morning ritual, Waff could think now about the trip outward to powindah places and the return just completed, which had made ghufran necessary. Other worshipers made way for him as he went back to the inner corridors and entered the slide passage that dropped him to the central garden where he had asked his councillors to meet him.\nIt was a successful foray among the powindah, he thought.\nEvery time he left the inner worlds of the Bene Tleilax Waff felt himself to be on lashkar, a war party seeking that ultimate revenge which his people named secretly as Bodal (always capitalized and always the first thing reaffirmed in ghufran or khel). This most recent lashkar had been exquisitely successful.\nWaff emerged from the slide into a central garden filled with sunlight by prismatic reflectors on the surrounding rooftops. A small fountain played its visual fugue at the heart of a graveled circle. A low fence of white palings at one side enclosed a closely cropped lawn, a space near enough to the fountain that the air would be moist but not so close that the splashing water would intrude on low- voiced conversation. Around the grassy enclosure, ten narrow benches of an ancient plastic were arranged—nine of them in a semicircle facing a tenth bench set slightly apart.\nPausing at the edge of the grassy enclosure, Waff glanced around him, wondering why he had never before felt quite this intense pleasure at sight of the place. The dark blue of the benches was intrinsic to the material. Centuries of use had worn the benches into soft curves along the arm rests and where countless bottoms had planted themselves, but the color was just as strong in the worn places as it was elsewhere.\nWaff sat down facing his nine councillors, marshaling the words he knew he must use. The document he had brought back from his latest lashkar, indeed, the very reason for that excursion, could not have been more exquisitely timed. The label on it and the words carried a mighty message for the Tleilaxu.\nFrom an inner pocket Waff removed the thin sheaf of ridulian crystal. He noted the quickened interest of his councillors: nine faces similar to his own, Masheikhs of the innermost kehl. All reflected expectancy. They had read this document in kehl: “The Atreides Manifesto.” They had spent a night of reflection on the manifesto’s message. Now, the words must be confronted. Waff placed the document on his lap.\n“| propose to spread these words far and wide,” Waff said.\n“Without change?” That was Mirlat, the councillor closest to ghola-transformation among all of them. Mirlat no doubt aspired to Abdl and Mahai. Waff focused on the councillor’s wide jaws where the cartilage had grown over the centuries as a visible mark of his current body’s great age.\n“Exactly as it has come into our hands,” Waff said.\n“Dangerous,” Mirlat said.\nWaff turned his head to the right, his childlike profile outlined against the fountain for his councillors to observe. God’s hand is on my right! The sky above him was polished carnelian as though Bandalong, the most ancient city of the Tleilaxu, had been built under one of those gigantic artificial covers erected to protect pioneers on the harsher planets.\nWhen he returned his attention to his councillors, Waff’s features remained bland.\n“Not dangerous to us,” he said.\n“A matter of opinion,” Mirlat said.\n“Then let us consider opinions,” Waff said. “Have we a need to fear Ix or the Fish Speakers? Indeed not. They are ours, although they do not know it.”\nWaff let this sink in; all of them knew that new Face Dancers sat in the highest councils of Ix and Fish Speakers, the exchange undetected.\n“The Guild will not move against us or oppose us because we are their only secure source of melange,” Waff said.\n“Then what of these Honored Matres returned from the Scattering?” Mirlat demanded.\n“We will deal with them when it is required of us,” Waff said. “And we will be helped by the descendants of our own people who voluntarily went out into the Scattering.”\n“The time does appear opportune,” one of the other councillors murmured.\nIt was Torg the Younger who had spoken, Waff observed. Good. There was a vote secured.\n“The Bene Gesserit!” Mirlat snapped.\n“I think the Honored Matres will remove the witches from our path,” Waff said. “Already they growl against each other like animals in the fighting pit.”\n“What if the author of that manifesto is identified?” Mirlat demanded. “What then?”\nSeveral heads nodded among the councillors. Waff marked them: people to be won over.\n“It is dangerous to be called Atreides in this age,” he said.\n“Except perhaps on Gammu,” Mirlat said. “And the name Atreides has been signed to that document!”\nHow odd, Waff thought. The CHOAM representative at the powindah conference that had taken Waff away from the inner planets of Tleilax had emphasized that very point. But most of CHOAM’s people were secret atheists who looked on\nall religion as suspect, and certainly the Atreides had been a potent religious force. CHOAM worries had been almost palpable.\nWaff recounted this CHOAM reaction now.\n“This CHOAM hireling, damn his Godless soul, is right,” Mirlat insisted. “The document’s insidious.”\nMirlat will have to be dealt with, Waff thought. He lifted the manifesto from his lap and read the first line aloud:\n“In the beginning was the word and the word was God.”\n“Directly from the Orange Catholic Bible,” Mirlat said. Once more, heads nodded in worried agreement.\nWaff showed the points of his canines in a brief smile. “Do you suggest that there are those among the powindah who suspect the existence of the Shariat and the Masheikhs?”\nIt felt good to speak these words openly, reminding his listeners that only here among the innermost Tleilaxu were the old words and the old language preserved without change. Did Mirlat or any of the others fear that Atreides words could subvert the Shariat?\nWaff posed this question, too, and saw the worried frowns.\n“Is there one among you,” Waff asked, “who believes that a single powindah knows how we use the language of God?”\nThere! Let them think on that! Every one of them here had been wakened time after time in ghola flesh. There was a fleshly continuity in this Council that no other people had ever achieved. Mirlat himself had seen the Prophet with his own eyes. Scytale had spoken to Muad’Dib! Learning how the flesh could be", " those among the powindah who suspect the existence of the Shariat and the Masheikhs?”\nIt felt good to speak these words openly, reminding his listeners that only here among the innermost Tleilaxu were the old words and the old language preserved without change. Did Mirlat or any of the others fear that Atreides words could subvert the Shariat?\nWaff posed this question, too, and saw the worried frowns.\n“Is there one among you,” Waff asked, “who believes that a single powindah knows how we use the language of God?”\nThere! Let them think on that! Every one of them here had been wakened time after time in ghola flesh. There was a fleshly continuity in this Council that no other people had ever achieved. Mirlat himself had seen the Prophet with his own eyes. Scytale had spoken to Muad’Dib! Learning how the flesh could be renewed and the memories restored, they had condensed this power into a single government whose potency was confined lest it be demanded everywhere. Only the witches had a similar storehouse of experience upon which to draw and they moved with fearful caution, terrified that they might produce another Kwisatz Haderach!\nWaff said these things to his councillors, adding: “The time for action has come.”\nWhen no one spoke disagreement, Waff said: “This manifesto has a single author. Every analysis agrees. Mirlat?”\n“Written by one person and that person a true Atreides, no doubt of it,” Mirlat agreed.\n“All at the powindah conference affirmed this,” Waff said. “Even a third-stage Guild steersman agrees.”\n“But that one person has produced a thing that excites violent reactions among diverse peoples,” Mirlat argued.\n“Have we ever questioned the Atreides talent for disruption?” Waff asked. “When the powindah showed me this document | knew God had sent us a signal.”\n“Do the witches still deny authorship?” Torg the Younger asked.\nHow alertly apt he is, Waff thought.\n“Every powindah religion is called into question by this manifesto,” Waff said. “Every faith except ours is left hanging in limbo.”\n“Exactly the problem!” Mirlat pounced.\n“But only we know this,” Waff said. “Who else even suspects the existence of the Shariat?”\n“The Guild,” Mirlat said.\n“They have never spoken of it and they never will. They know what our response would be.”\nWaff lifted the sheaf of papers from his lap and again read aloud:\n“Forces that we cannot understand permeate our universe. We see the shadows of those forces when they are projected upon a screen available to our senses, but understand them we do not.”\n“The Atreides who wrote that knows of the Shariat,” Mirlat muttered.\nWaff continued reading as though there had been no interruption:\n“Understanding requires words. Some things cannot be reduced to words. There are things that can only be\nexperienced wordlessly.”\nAs though he handled a holy relic, Waff returned the document to his lap. Softly, so that his listeners were required to bend toward him and some cupped a hand behind an ear, Waff said: “This says our universe is magical. It says all arbitrary forms are transient and subject to magical changes. Science has led us to this interpretation as though it placed us on a track from which we cannot deviate.”\nHe allowed these words to fester for a moment, then: “No Rakian priest of the Divided God nor any other powindah charlatan can accept that. Only we know it because our God is a magical God whose language we speak.”\n“We will be accused of the authorship,” Mirlat said. The moment he had spoken, Mirlat shook his head sharply from side to side. “No! | see it. | see what you mean.”\nWaff held his silence. He could see that all of them were reflecting on their Sufi origins, recalling the Great Belief and the Zensunni ecumenism that had spawned the Bene Tleilax. The people of this kehl knew the God-given facts of their origins but generations of secrecy assured that no powindah shared their knowledge.\nWords flowed silently through Waff’s mind: “Assumptions based on understanding contain belief in an absolute ground out of which all things spring like plants growing from seeds.”\nKnowing that his councillors also recalled this catechism of the Great Belief, Waff reminded them of the Zensunni admonition.\n“Behind such assumptions lies a faith in words that the powindah do not question. Only the Shariat question and we do so silently.”\nHis councillors nodded in unison.\nWaff inclined his head slightly and continued: “The act of saying that things exist that cannot be described in words Shakes a universe where words are the supreme belief.”\n“Powindah poison!” his councillors shouted.\nHe had them all now and Waff hammered home his victory by demanding: “What is the Sufi-Zensunni Credo?”\nThey could not speak it but all reflected on it: 70 achieve s’torino understanding is needed. S’tori exists without words, without even a name.\nIn a moment, all of them looked up and exchanged knowing glances. Mirlat took it upon himself to recite the Tleilaxu pledge:\n“I can say God, but that is not my God. That is only a noise and no more potent than any other noise.”\n“|I now see,” Waff said, “that you all sense the power that has fallen into our hands through this document. Millions upon millions of copies already are being circulated among the powindah.”\n“Who does this?” Mirlat asked.\n“Who cares?” Waff countered. “Let the powindah chase after them, seeking their origin, trying to suppress them, preaching against them. With each such action, the powindah inject more power into these words.”\n“Should we not preach against these words, too?” Mirlat asked.\n“Only if the occasion demands it,” Waff said. “See you!” He slapped the papers against his knees. “The powindah have constricted their awareness to its tightest purpose and that is their weakness. We must insure that this manifesto gains as wide a circulation as possible.”\n“The magic of our God is our only bridge,” the councillors intoned.\nAll of them, Waff observed, had been restored to the central security of their faith. It had been easily managed. No Masheikh shared the powindah stupidity that whined: “In thy infinite grace, God, why me?” In one sentence, the powindah invoked infinity and denied it, never once observing their own foolishness.\n“Scytale,” Waff said.\nThe youngest and most baby-faced of the councillors, seated at the far left as was fitting, leaned forward eagerly.\n“Arm the faithful,” Waff said.\n“I marvel that an Atreides has given us this weapon,” Mirlat said. “How can it be that the Atreides always fasten upon an ideal that enlists the billions who must follow?”\n“It is not the Atreides, it is God,” Waff said. He lifted his arms then and spoke the closing ritual: “The Masheikh have met in kehl and felt the presence of their God.”\nWaff closed his eyes and waited for the others to leave. Masheikh! How good it was to name themselves in kehl, speaking the language of Islamiyat, which no Tleilaxu spoke outside his own secret councils; not even to Face Dancers did they speak it. Nowhere in the Wekht of Jandola, not to the farthest reaches of the Tleilaxu Yaghist, was there a living powindah who knew this secret.\nYaghist, Waff thought, rising from his bench. Yaghist, the land of the unruled.\nHe thought he could feel the document vibrating in his hand. This Atreides Manifesto was the very kind of thing the masses of powindah would follow to their doom.\nSome days it’s melange; some days it’s bitter dirt.\n—RAKIAN APHORISM\nn her third year with the priests of Rakis, the girl Sheeana\nlay full length atop a high curving dune. She peered into the morning distance where a great rumbling friction could be heard. The light was a ghostly silver that frosted the horizon with filmy haze. The night’s chill still lay on the sand.\nShe knew the priests were watching her from the safety of their water-girded tower some two kilometers behind her, but this gave her little concern. The trembling of the sand beneath her body demanded full attention.\nIt’s a big one, she thought. Seventy meters at least. A beautiful big one.\nThe gray stillsuit felt slick and smooth against her skin. It had none of the abrasive patches of the old hand-me-down she had worn before the priests took her into their care. She felt thankful for the fine stillsuit and the thick robe of white and purple that covered it, but most of all she felt the excitement of being here. Something rich and dangerous filled her at moments such as this.\nThe priests did not understand what happened here. She knew this. They were cowards. She glanced over her shoulder at the distant tower and saw sunglint on lenses.\nA precocious child of eleven standard years, slender and dark-skinned with sun-streaked brown hair, she could visualize clearly what the priests saw through their spying lenses.\nThey see me doing what they do not dare. They see me in the path of Shaitan. | look very small on the sand and Shaitan looks very big. They can see him already.\nFrom the rasping sound, she knew that she, too, would soon see the giant worm. Sheeana did not think of the approaching monster as Shai-hulud, God of the sands, a thing the priests chanted each morning in obeisance to the pearl of Leto Il’s awareness that lay encapsulated in each of the multi-ridged rulers of the desert. She thought of the worms mainly as “they who spared me,” or as Shaitan.\nThey belonged to her now.\nIt was a relationship begun slightly more than three years ago during the month of her eighth birthday, the Month Igat by the old calendar. Her village had been a poor one, a pioneer venture built far beyond more secure barriers such as the qanats and ring canals of Keen. Only a moat of damp sand guarded such pioneer places. Shaitan avoided water but the sandtrout vector soon took away any dampness. Precious moisture captured in windtraps had to be expended each day to renew the barrier. Her village was a miserable cluster of shacks and hovels with two small windtraps, adequate for drinking water but with only a sporadic surplus that could be apportioned to the worm barrier.\nThat morning—much like this morning, the night’s chill Sharp in her nose and lungs, the horizon constricted by a ghostly haze—most of the village children had fanned out into the desert, there to seek bits and fragments of melange, which Shaitan sometimes left behind in his passage. Two big ones had been heard nearby in the night. Melange, even at modern deflated prices, could buy the glazed bricks to line a third windtrap.\nEach searching child not only looked for the spice but also sought those signs which would reveal one of the old Fremen sietch strongholds. There were only remnants of such places now but the rock barriers provided a greater\nsecurity against Shaitan. And some of the remnant sietch places were reputed to contain lost hoards of melange. Every villager dreamed of such a discovery.\nSheeana, wearing", " drinking water but with only a sporadic surplus that could be apportioned to the worm barrier.\nThat morning—much like this morning, the night’s chill Sharp in her nose and lungs, the horizon constricted by a ghostly haze—most of the village children had fanned out into the desert, there to seek bits and fragments of melange, which Shaitan sometimes left behind in his passage.

There were only remnants of such places now but the rock barriers provided a greater\nsecurity against Shaitan. And some of the remnant sietch places were reputed to contain lost hoards of melange. Every villager dreamed of such a discovery.\nSheeana, wearing her patched stillsuit and flimsy robe, went alone to the northeast, toward the faraway smoky mound of air that told of the great city of Keen with its moisture richness lifting into the sun-warmed breezes.\nHunting scraps of melange in the sand was largely a matter of focusing attention into the nostrils. It was a form of concentration that left only bits of awareness attuned to the rasping sand that told of Shaitan’s approach. Leg muscles moved automatically in the non-rhythmic walk that blended with the desert’s natural sounds.\nAt first, Sheeana did not hear the screaming. It fitted intimately into the saltated friction of windblown sand across the barracans that concealed the village from her sight. Slowly the sound penetrated her consciousness and then it demanded her attention.\nMany voices screaming!\nSheeana discarded the desert precaution of random strides. Moving swiftly as her childish muscles would carry her, she scrambled up the slipface of the barracan and stared along it toward that terrifying sound. She was in time to see that which cut off the last of the screams.\nWind and sandtrout had dried a wide arc of the barrier at the far side of her village. She could see the gap by the color difference. A wild worm had penetrated the opening. It circled close inside the remaining dampness. The gigantic flame-shadowed mouth scooped up people and hovels ina swiftly tightening circle.\nSheeana saw the last survivors huddled at the center of this destruction, a space already cleared of its rude hovels and tumbled with the remains of the windtraps. Even as she watched, some of the people tried to break away into the desert. Sheeana recognized her father among the frantic\nrunners. None escaped. The great mouth engulfed all before turning to level the last of the village.\nSmoking sand remained and nothing else of the puny village that had dared to claim a scrap of Shaitan’s domain. The place where the village had been was as unmarked by human habitation as it had been before anyone walked there.\nSheeana took a gasping breath, inhaling through her nose to preserve the moisture of her body as any good child of the desert would do. She scanned the horizon for a sign of the other children but Shaitan’s track had left great curves and loops all around the far side of the village. Not a single human remained in view. She shouted, the high-pitched cry that would carry far through the dry air. No response came back to her.\nAlone.\nShe moved trancelike along the ridge of the dune toward where her village had been. As she neared the place a great wave of cinnamon odor filled her nostrils, carried on the wind that still dusted the tops of the dunes. She realized then what had happened. The village had been sited disastrously atop a pre-spice blow. As the great hoard far under the sand came to fruition, expanding in an explosion of melange, Shaitan had come. Every child knew Shaitan could not resist a spiceblow.\nRage and wild desperation began to fill Sheeana. Mindlessly, she raced down the dune toward Shaitan, coming up behind the worm as it turned back through the dry place where it had entered the village. Without thought, she dashed along beside the tail, scrambled onto it and ran forward along the great ridged back. At the hump behind its mouth, she crouched and beat her fists against the unyielding surface.\nThe worm stopped.\nHer anger suddenly converted to terror, Sheeana broke off pounding on the worm. She realized only then that she\nhad been screaming. A terrible sense of lonely exposure filled her. She did not Know how she had come here. She knew only where she was and this gripped her with an agony of fear.\nThe worm continued quiescent on the sand.\nSheeana did not know what to do. At any moment, the worm could roll over and crush her. Or it could burrow beneath the sand, leaving her on the surface to be scooped up at leisure.\nAbruptly, a long tremor worked its way down the worm’s length from its tail to Sheeana’s position behind the mouth. The worm began to move ahead. It turned in a wide arc and gathered speed on a course to the northeast.\nSheeana leaned forward and gripped the leading edge of a ring ridge on the worm’s back. She feared that any second it would slide beneath the sand. What could she do then? But Shaitan did not burrow. As minutes passed without any deviation from that straight and swift passage across the dunes, Sheeana found her mind working once more. She knew about this ride. The priests of the Divided God forbade it but the histories, both written and oral, said Fremen rode thus in the ancient days. Fremen stood tall atop Shaitan’s back supported by slender poles with hooked ends. The priests decreed that this had been done before Leto II shared His consciousness with the God of the desert. Now, nothing was permitted that might demean the scattered bits of Leto Il.\nWith a speed that astonished her, the worm carried Sheeana toward the mist-dazzled shape of Keen. The great city lay like a mirage on the distorted horizon. Sheeana’s threadbare robe whipped against the thin surface of her patched stillsuit. Her fingers ached where she gripped the leading edge of the giant ring. The cinnamon, burnt-rock and ozone of the worm’s heat exchange swept over her on Shifts in the wind.\nKeen began to gain definition ahead of her.\nThe priests will see me and be angry, she thought.\nShe identified the low brick structures that marked the first line of qanats and, beyond them, the enclosed barrel- curve of a surface aqueduct. Above these structures rose the walls of terraced gardens and the high profiles of giant windtraps, then the temple complex within its own water barriers.\nA day’s march across open sand in little more than an hour!\nHer parents and village neighbors had made this journey many times for trade and to join in the dancing but Sheeana had only accompanied them twice. She remembered mostly the dancing and the violence that followed. The size of Keen filled her with awe. So many buildings! So many people! Shaitan could not harm such a place as that.\nBut the worm plunged straight ahead as though it would ride over qanat and aqueduct. Sheeana stared at the city rising higher and higher in front of her. Fascination subdued her terror. Shaitan was not going to stop!\nThe worm ground to a halt.\nThe tubular surface vents of the qanat lay no more than fifty meters in front of its gaping mouth. She smelled the hot cinnamon exhalations, heard the deep rumblings of Shaitan’s interior furnace.\nIt became apparent to her at last that the journey had ended. Slowly, Sheeana released her grip on the ring. She stood, expecting any moment the worm would renew its motion. Shaitan remained quiescent. Moving cautiously, she Slid off her perch and dropped to the sand. She paused there. Would it move now? She held a vague idea of dashing for the qanat but this worm fascinated her. Slipping and Sliding in the disturbed sand, Sheeana moved around to the front of the worm and stared into the fearsome mouth. Within the frame of crystal teeth flames rolled forward and backward. A searing exhalation of spice odors swept over her.\nThe madness of that first dash down off the dune and onto the worm came back to Sheeana. “Damn you, Shaitan!” she shouted, shaking a fist at the awful mouth. “What did we ever do to you?”\nThese were words she had heard her mother use at the destruction of a tuber garden. No part of Sheeana’s awareness had ever questioned that name, Shaitan, nor her mother’s fury. She was of the poorest dregs at the bottom of the Rakian heap and she knew it. Her people believed in Shaitan first and Shai-hulud second. Worms were worms and often much worse. There was no justice on the open sand. Only danger lurked there. Poverty and fear of priests might drive her people onto the perilous dunes but they moved even then with the same angry persistence that had driven the Fremen.\nThis time, however, Shaitan had won.\nIt entered Sheeana’s awareness that she stood in the deadly path. Her thoughts, not yet fully formed, recognized only that she had done a crazy thing. Much later, as the Sisterhood’s teachings rounded her consciousness, she would realize that she had been overcome by the terror of loneliness. She had wanted Shaitan to take her into the company of her dead.\nA grating sound issued from beneath the worm.\nSheeana stifled a scream.\nSlowly at first, then faster, the worm backed off several meters. It turned there and gathered speed beside the twin- mounded track it had created coming from the desert. The grating of its passage diminished in the distance. Sheeana grew aware of another sound. She lifted her gaze to the sky. The thwock-thwock of a priestly ornithopter swept over her, brushing her with its shadow. The craft glistened in the morning sunlight as it followed the worm into the desert.\nSheeana felt a more familiar fear then.\nThe priests!\nShe kept her gaze on the 'thopter. It hovered in the distance, then returned to settle gently onto a patch of worm-smoothed sand nearby. She could smell the lubricants and the sickly acridity of the 'thopter’s fuel. The thing was a giant insect nestled on the sand, waiting to pounce upon her.\nA hatch popped open.\nSheeana threw back her shoulders and stood her ground. Very well; they had caught her. She knew what to expect now. Nothing could be gained by flight. Only the priests used ‘thopters. They could go anywhere and see anything.\nTwo richly robed priests, their garments all gold and white with purple trim, emerged and ran toward her across the sand. They knelt in front of Sheeana so close she could smell their perspiration and the musky melange incense which permeated their clothing. They were young but much like all the priests she could remember: soft of features, uncalloused hands, careless of their moisture losses. Neither of them wore a stillsuit under those robes.\nThe one on her left, his eyes on a level with Sheeana’s, spoke.\n“Child of Shai-hulud, we saw your Father bring you from His lands.”\nThe words made no sense to Sheeana. Priests were men to be feared. Her parents and all the adults she had ever known had impressed this upon her by words and actions."], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_69e66175d4262aced0813e50e6074d6455cb8cd4dd3c5a44fa2ae12388ef2525_v2"}
