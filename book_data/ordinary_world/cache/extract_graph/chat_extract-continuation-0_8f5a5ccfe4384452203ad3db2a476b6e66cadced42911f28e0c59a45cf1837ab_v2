�天，我和大家一样焦急。眼看庄稼都晒干了，就好象把我的心也晒干了。现在就指望川道里的这点庄稼，可东拉河里的水都叫上游几个村子霸占了……” \n　　“我们就等死呀？不能把他们的坝给豁了？”一队副队长田福高打断田福堂的话，插嘴说。 \n　　有许多人立刻附合田福高的意见。 \n　　田福堂满意地笑了。他等众人的声音平息下来，说：“我也正盘算这样干哩！你们和我想到一块了！如果大家意见一致，那咱们干脆今晚上就动手！ \n　　“不过，为了避免村子之间的公开冲突，防止混战一场，咱们要暗暗地做这事。等他们知道了，水已经到了咱村里，他们也只能干瞪眼！到时公社追究这事，咱有话可说。就是的嘛！东拉河是大家的东拉河，他们几个村已经把庄稼浇了好几遍，难道就让咱们等死吗？东拉河的水本来就有我们的一份，又不是他们几个村出钱买下的！” \n　　由于严重的灾难和对上游几个村霸水的愤慨，所有的队干部都一致拥护这个做法。除此之外，危难中的双水村别无选择。连平时谨慎的金俊山也气势磅礴地说：“干就干！不能让人家这样欺负了！只是能救活川道里的庄稼，咱们担什么风险都不怕！真是没王法了！” \n　　孙玉亭大声嚷着说：“共产党员和队干部要站在这场斗争的前头！” \n　　福堂太满意这个气氛了，觉得他适时地把双水村这条大船的舵又牢牢地握在了手中。他兴奋地说：“要是大家再没什么意见，咱们就很快安排一下，马上行动！” \n　　这时，二队长金俊武从后脚地的灶火圪崂里，转到炕桌前面来。他不慌不忙用手把煤油灯罩拿起来，点着了一锅旱烟。 \n　　他把玻璃灯罩又放到灯上，就开口说：“我同意大家的意见。不过，在做这事的时候，尽量周到一些。我们不敢把人家坝里的水都放完。下山村路太远，不要动这个村子的坝。要豁就豁石圪节的坝。但只在石圪节的坝梁旁边开个口子，水放出来以后，就到了罐子村的坝里。然后把罐子村的坝再豁开一个口子，把水放到咱们村里。这样，咱们的问题解决了，他们两个村也还有水，就是他们发现了，也不会有大问题。估计第二天天明，这两个村就会发现他们的坝上有个豁口，那他们自己就会堵住的。可这时咱们的水已经有了。“如果这样，咱们从石圪节坝上动手挖开豁口起，水就要流大半夜。那么，咱们村现在那个坝又太小，怕盛不下这么多水。因此，得分三股人马：一股去石圪节，人\n######################\nOutput:",
