Once part of a planet-wide desert known as the *bahr bela ma* (\"\"ocean without water\"\"), the Sareer is now a remnant of Arrakis's former desert glory, enclosed by the imposing **barrier Wall**. This high-walled domain served as the Tyrant's stronghold, centered around the **Citadel** and the **Little Citadel**, from which Leto II observed the arid landscape.  \n\nGeographically, the Sareer is located far to the south, bordered by the **Forbidden Forest** and near **Tuono** and **Tabur Village**. Its harsh, desolate environment is visible from key locations such as the Citadel's south tower and Moneo's workroom. The region is frequently mentioned in narratives involving movement and climbing, underscoring its role as a pivotal setting.  \n\nOnce the great walled desert of Leto II's reign, the Sareer has since eroded, yet it remains a symbol of the planet's transformation and the Tyrant's legacy. The river that once flowed through it has vanished, marking the end of an era. Despite its decline, the Sareer endures as a testament to Arrakis's past, embodying both its ecological and political history.\",8\n461,LETO II,,82\n1264,ONN,\"**Onn** is a prominent city on Arrakis (also referred to as Rakis), serving as the Festival City within the empire of the God Emperor Leto II. Built in a notch of the Shield Wall, it is a bustling hub of political, religious, and ceremonial activity, often visited by Leto’s royal entourage. The city is associated with significant events, including the Decennial Festival, where public rituals like Siaynoq take place in its plaza—a site marked by religious fervor and occasional violence.  \n\nBeneath Onn lies a secret, windowless room where a woman works in secrecy, and deep underground regions house structures such as ramps and service burrows used for rebel meetings. The city is a center of rebellion, known for its mechanical smells and as a base for dissident activities. It is also near the Forbidden Forest and features orchards and gardens that sustain its population.  \n\nOnn’s landscape is cluttered with houses, forests, and remnants of the ancient city of Arrakeen, reflecting Leto’s controlled environment. It is home to the Fish Speakers' School, where Siona studies, and is a destination for off-world visitors. The city is linked to pivotal moments, such as Duncan Idaho’s arrival after his resurrection, Hwi Noree’s summons by Leto, and the Tleilaxu’s planned attack on the God Emperor.  \n\nDespite its ceremonial importance, Onn is also a place of tension—mentioned in the context of Idaho’s \"\"night of alarms\"\" and as a potential trigger for Leto’s transformation into the Worm. While Siona once considered returning to Onn, the royal entourage often diverts to the Citadel instead. The city’s peculiar design, centered around its plaza for public viewing, underscores its role as a stage for Leto’s rule and the empire’s unfolding drama.  \n\nPronounced with a nasal inflection, Onn remains a key location in the empire’s geography, blending grandeur, secrecy, and rebellion beneath its festival-driven facade.\",14\n1186,HOLY METAMORPHOSIS,\"The **Holy Metamorphosis** is a pivotal event or concept tied to **Leto II**, the God Emperor in the *Dune* universe. It encompasses two interconnected aspects: his removal from the evolutionary succession and his transformation into the **Divided God**, which also led to the creation of **sandtrout**.  \n\nInitially, the Holy Metamorphosis marks Leto II's departure from the established path of human evolution, signifying a deliberate break from his role as a guiding force. This shift is not merely physical but also symbolic, representing a fundamental change in his relationship with humanity and the broader cosmic order.  \n\nSimultaneously, the Holy Metamorphosis describes Leto II's physical transformation into the **Divided God**, a state where his consciousness fragments while his body merges with sandtrout—small, worm-like creatures integral to the desert ecosystem of Arrakis. This process ensures his legacy persists in a dispersed form, influencing future events beyond his direct rule.  \n\nWhile the descriptions differ slightly—one emphasizing his removal from evolution and the other focusing on his physical transformation—they are not contradictory. Instead, they reflect different dimensions of the same event: the Holy Metamorphosis represents both an ideological and biological shift, marking the end of Leto II's centralized rule and the beginning of a new phase in the universe's unfolding destiny.  \n\nIn summary, the **Holy Metamorphosis** is the moment when **Leto II** transcends his singular existence, withdrawing from evolutionary guidance while undergoing a profound physical change that disperses his essence into sandtrout, ensuring his enduring influence on the cosmos.\",2\n1395,DURO NUNEPI,\"Duro Nunepi is the Tleilaxu Ambassador, a proud and flinty-faced man who represents the Tleilaxu in negotiations with Leto II.

They specialize in creating sophisticated devices, ranging from navigation tools and chronometers to the cibus hood, the Royal Cart, and even satellites. Their innovations, such as the \"\"no-room\"\" technology, allow them to conceal their activities from prescient beings like Leto II, furthering their reputation for secrecy and subterfuge.  \n\nPolitically, the Ixians are often in conflict with the Bene Gesserit and the God Emperor, employing both technological and psychological strategies to undermine their rivals. Notably, they engineered Hwi Noree—a paradoxically anti-mechanical individual—to emotionally manipulate Leto II. They collaborate with factions like the Fish Speakers and the Tleilaxu, though their alliances are opportunistic. Their involvement in espionage, including the theft of Leto’s sacred books and the creation of a machine for the Guild, underscores their role as master schemers.  \n\nDespite their contributions, the Ixians are viewed with suspicion. Leto II criticizes their limitations, even as he tolerates their inventions. Rumors persist of their experiments with artificial intelligence, violating ancient taboos. Their dual nature—both indispensable and threatening—makes them a pivotal yet unpredictable force in the Empire’s power struggles.  \n\nIn summary, the Ixians are a technocracy defined by their brilliance, secrecy, and political machinations, wielding technology as both a tool and a weapon in the Dune universe.\",29\n1488,THE GOLDEN PATH,,4\n584,TLEILAX,\"Tleilax is a lone planet in the Thalim system, renowned as both a renegade training center for Mentats and the homeworld of the Bene Tleilax. The planet holds significant strategic and cultural importance due to its dual roles: it serves as a hub for the development of highly skilled Mentats—human computers trained in logic and analysis—while also being the central stronghold of the secretive and genetically adept Bene Tleilax. The Bene Tleilax, a powerful and enigmatic faction, are known for their mastery of genetic engineering and biological manipulation, further cementing Tleilax's reputation as a planet of both intellectual and scientific intrigue. Despite its renegade status, Tleilax remains a pivotal location in the broader political and technological landscape of its universe.\",2\n1660,MARTIN BURO,\"An Ixian who restored and preserved Van Gogh's painting, adding a sense projector to it\",2\n559,RICHEESE,\"The fourth planet of Eridani A, known for its advanced machine culture and miniaturization.\"\"\",2\n1427,IXIAN TUBE-LIFT,A technological transportation system used by the Ixians>,1\n2011,HOLZMANN’S UNIFICATION CONCEPT,\"Holzmann’s unification concept is a theoretical framework used by the Ixians.\"\"\",1\n33,BUTLERIAN JIHAD,\"The **Butlerian Jihad**, also known as the **Great Revolt**, was a pivotal historical conflict in which humanity rose against thinking machines, reshaping the technological, political, and philosophical landscape of the Imperium. Spanning from 201 B.G. to 108 B.G., this crusade sought to eradicate artificial intelligence and machines that simulated human cognition, driven by a desire to preserve human autonomy, essence, and judgment. Its aftermath led to the strict prohibition of thinking machines, influencing the Imperium's feudal structure and establishing human-centric governance.  \n\nThe Jihad's cultural and religious impact was profound, embedding deep-seated taboos against artificial intelligence and machine-like thinking. It shaped the Bene Gesserit's doctrines, reinforcing their reliance on human memory (such as their Archives) and their prohibitions against artificial insemination. The conflict also spurred the rise of human mental disciplines, including the Bene Gesserit's mental training and the development of **mentats**—human computers trained to replace mechanical calculation.  \n\nReferences to the Jihad appear in various contexts, from **Leto II's** ambiguous relationship with technology—where he upholds its prohibitions while potentially violating them—to **Waff's** comparisons with the Honored Matres' logic. The event is often cited as a cautionary tale, illustrating the dangers of machine dependency and the ethical dilemmas surrounding artificial intelligence.  \n\nThough some interpretations suggest contradictions—such as whether the Jihad was a rebellion, a crusade, or a war—the consensus remains that it was a defining uprising against machine-logic, leaving lasting repercussions on technology, religion, and societal organization. Its legacy endures in the prohibition of devices like the **Ixian memocorder** and the destruction of libraries, ensuring human dominance over machine intelligence.  \n\nIn summary, the Butlerian Jihad was a transformative historical event that eradicated thinking machines, enforced human supremacy, and laid the foundation for the Imperium's technological and ideological frameworks. Its influence persists across millennia, shaping the ethical and political boundaries of the Dune universe.\",17\n1254,LETO'S PEACE,\"**LETO'S PEACE**  \n\nLETO'S PEACE refers to the prolonged period of enforced tranquility spanning over three thousand years, established and maintained under the absolute rule of Leto II, the God Emperor. This era of stability was upheld through a combination of Leto's authoritarian governance, the disciplined enforcement of the Fish Speakers (his elite military force), and other stringent measures designed to suppress rebellion and ensure order across the Empire.  \n\nThe peace was not voluntary but imposed, ensuring that no major conflicts or wars disrupted the Empire for millennia. While descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the coercive nature of this tranquility, attributing its longevity to Leto's unyielding control and the mechanisms he instituted to preserve his reign. The Fish Speakers, as both protectors and enforcers, played a pivotal role in sustaining this peace, acting as both a military and religious order loyal to Leto.  \n\nDespite minor variations in wording, the core concept remains clear: LETO'S PEACE was a rigid, artificial stability, lasting three thousand years, directly tied to Leto II's dominion and the systems he implemented to enforce it. There are no contradictions in the descriptions, only reinforcing the idea of an unchanging, controlled era under his rule.\",3\n876,HARQ AL-ADA,\"**HARQ AL-ADA** is a multifaceted historical figure, philosopher, and chronicler within the *Dune* universe, renowned for his contributions to Fremen wisdom and Atreides history. He is the author of several significant works, including *\"\"Riddles of Arrakis,\"\"* a text that encapsulates Fremen teachings and intellectual challenges, and *\"\"The Holy Metamorphosis,\"\"* which analyzes the actions and legacy of Leto II. Additionally, he penned *\"\"The Story of Liet-Kynes,\"\"* a referenced account of the famed planetologist, and *\"\"The Testament of Arrakis,\"\"* documenting the achievements of Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides).  \n\nHarq al-Ada is also recognized as a reconstructor and interpreter of Muad'Dib's teachings, providing valuable insights into his father's philosophies. His role as a chronicler extends to familial and political spheres; he is mentioned as an observer of the relationship between Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, as well as Ghanima's mate and an ancestor of the Atreides line. Through his lineage, he is connected to Siona Atreides, further cementing his place in Atreides oral history.  \n\nNotably, Harq al-Ada shares a resemblance to the historical figure Nyshae, revealing a shared Corrino bloodline, which adds another layer to his complex heritage. His works and observations serve as critical historical and philosophical records, bridging Fremen traditions, Atreides legacy, and the broader political dynamics of the Imperium.  \n\nIn summary, Harq al-Ada emerges as a pivotal scholar, historian, and familial link, whose writings and lineage deeply influence the cultural and historical narratives of Arrakis and the Atreides dynasty.\",10\n634,RALPH SLATTERY,\"Ralph Slattery was a family friend of Frank Herbert who abhorred machines\"\"\",1\n786,TUONO,,7\n1515,OLD FREMEN,\"The Old Fremen are the ancient ancestors referenced in the lute-player's song remembered by Moneo.\"\"\",2\n1489,WALL,\"The **WALL** is a significant geographical and structural feature with dual characteristics. Near **Tuono village**, it appears as a natural geographical formation, with a river located beyond it. However, it is also described as the **barrier Wall**, a massive artificial structure enclosing the **Sareer**. This imposing wall has a sheer face, which is currently being scaled by a climber named **Idaho**.  \n\nThe two descriptions suggest that the WALL may serve both as a natural boundary and a constructed barrier, possibly blending into the landscape or serving different purposes depending on its location. The presence of a river beyond its natural segment implies a division between territories, while its role as an enclosure for the Sareer indicates a defensive or restrictive function. The fact that Idaho is climbing its sheer face further emphasizes its formidable and challenging nature.  \n\nTo reconcile the descriptions, the WALL likely exists as a hybrid structure—part natural, part man-made—with varying features along its expanse. Its proximity to Tuono village and the Sareer suggests it plays a key role in the region's geography and possibly its societal or political dynamics. The combined details paint a picture of a monumental and multifaceted barrier, serving both as a physical landmark and a significant obstacle.  \n\n(Word count: 186)\",4\n1473,IXIAN INSTRUMENTS,\"Technological devices created by Ixians to monitor and control the Sareer's climate\"\"\",1\n1497,RINGWALL WEST,\"Ringwall West is a location where the procession climbs, marking a significant point in the narrative.\"\"\",1\n1695,GOD’S WAY,\"A wide avenue in the city, historically the Tyrant's route into the city from the Sareer.\",1\n1441,NYSHAE,\"Nyshae is the dependable commander of Leto's plaza forces, of Corrino blood\"\"\",4\n1442,KIUEEMO,\"Kieuemo is a newly promoted sub-bashar under Nyshae's command\"\"\",1\n1659,VINCENT VAN GOGH,\"**Vincent van Gogh** is a historical painter from Old Terra (Earth), renowned for his artistic contributions and referenced in discussions about human creativity and the Scattering. His legacy has endured across time, with one of his paintings preserved through advanced Ixian artifice, as noted by Odrade. Though described as an \"\"ancient artist\"\" in one context, this aligns with his historical origins on Old Terra, emphasizing his enduring influence. The references to van Gogh highlight both his significance in human cultural history and the preservation of his work through advanced technological means in a distant future. His name serves as a symbol of artistic expression and the lasting impact of human creativity across epochs.  \n\n(Word count: 100)  \n\n*Note: The output is concise and coherent, resolving the slight discrepancy between \"\"ancient artist\"\" and \"\"historical painter\"\" by contextualizing both as references to his Old Terra origins and enduring legacy.
