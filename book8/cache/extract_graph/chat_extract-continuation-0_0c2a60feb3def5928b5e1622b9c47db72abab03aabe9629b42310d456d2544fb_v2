两人几乎是同时抬头对视一眼，都看出彼此眼中的不可思议。这种情况意味着，没有魂力啊！\n\n    可是，蓝轩宇这蓝银草看上去如此特殊，怎么可能没有魂力呢？\n\n    就在他们心中不信的下一瞬，突然之间，魂力测试仪猛的一震，一道光柱笔直冲出，足有一尺的白色光芒坚定如柱，凝实无比。\n\n    因为出现的突然，倒是把蓝潇和南澄吓了一跳，但紧接着他们眼底就都流露出骇然之色。\n\n    一尺？一尺意味着什么？\n\n    一寸是一级魂力。一尺就是十级。而对于武魂刚刚觉醒的人来说，十级就是极限了啊！也就是说，这孩子是，先天满魂力！\n\n    那可是先天满魂力啊！就算是在当今魂导科技已经十分发达的情况下，先天满魂力的情况也是极其罕见的。只有那些上古流传下来的大家族，或者特别强大的武魂才有可能出现。\n\n    随着魂导科技进入到了星际层次之后，科技产物开始更多的占据主导，原本斗罗大陆时期，魂师作为整个世界核心的地位也随之改变。可尽管如此，魂师却依旧是绝对高贵的职业。就像南澄的军衔能够后来追上，就和她已经是魂帝级别的魂师有着极大的关系。\n\n    尤其是一些特殊职业，军方的特种战斗部队，都需要魂师才能加入。很多魂导武器也只有魂师才能更好的驾驭。因此，魂师虽然不再是决定性的存在，可也依旧是极为高贵的职业。\n\n    先天满魂力和天才是划等号的，任何一位先天满魂力的拥有者，都会被联邦重视。一旦出现，都会得到全额奖学金。也就是说，在他至少完成高等魂师学院的学习之前，所有的费用全部由联邦来承担，甚至还有额外的补贴。连用来提升魂师跨阶质变的魂灵，联邦都会有一部分赠送和一部分大幅度优惠。\n\n    人生而平等，可在武魂觉醒那一刻开始，其实等阶还是会自然而然的划分出来。先天满魂力的魂师，只要不是特殊情况，以目前联邦完善的修炼体系，都应该能修炼到九阶九十级以上的封号斗罗层次。而那已经是站在联邦顶层的存在了。就像是上古时期从平民跨入贵族阶层一样。\n\n    六岁而同的武魂是什么，和父母的武魂有直接关系，因为这是遗传性的。但也并非绝对，因为偶尔也会出现武魂变异的情况。有变异的不好的，也有变异的特别强大的。如果出现变异后武魂是先天满魂力的话，那就绝对是一步登天了。\n\n    而此时此刻，蓝轩宇的武�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
