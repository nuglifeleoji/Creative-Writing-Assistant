第43章\n　　郝红梅象一只兔子被猎人关进了笼子。惊慌。绝望。痛不欲人。她在二门市后面的这个窑洞里，哭得死去活来。她在心里喊叫说：一切都完了……本来，眼看就要高中毕业，她心中充满了无限的快乐。她终于熬到了头。另外，更让她心花怒放的是，她和养民的关系也眼看快要成功了。虽然他们还没有具体谈论婚姻的事，但她相信顾养民确实爱上了她。尽管毕业后，她要回农村去劳动，但未来的生活已在她面前展示了灿烂的前景。她知道，她不会在农村呆很长时间的。养民的父母亲都是黄原地区象样的人物，他们怎么能让他们的儿媳妇在农村劳动呢？他们一定会想办法在黄原给她找工作！她将在那个梦想中的城市和养民一块幸福而荣耀地生活。这并不是梦想，养民实际上已经给她暗示过这一切。因此，当毕业来临，农村来的同学都心神不安、忧郁惆怅的时候，红梅心里却象五月的阳光照耀着一般，亮堂堂，暖洋洋。太阳就是顾养民。这位高贵人家的子弟给她的生活带来了无限美好的希望。最使她感动的是，养民不嫌她的地主成份；说他们家文化革命中父亲也被打成了“反动学术权威”，挨过整，受过批判；他说成份不能决定一个人是好是坏。多有水平的见识啊！亲爱的养民是世界上最好的男人！ \n　　当郝红梅在毕业的这几天里万般欢乐的时候，却遇到了一个让她扫兴的情况：班里所有的同学在分别之际，都互相赠送礼物，以作留念。原来她想大概是相互要好的同学之间才这样呢——她初中毕业时就是相好的同学才互赠礼物。但这里却兴这样一种人人都送的风气！这也难怪，人一上点岁数，就变得世故了，不管平时关系怎样，这种时候好象都成了兄弟姐妹。 \n　　既然大家都是这样，她也只得随俗入俗。
