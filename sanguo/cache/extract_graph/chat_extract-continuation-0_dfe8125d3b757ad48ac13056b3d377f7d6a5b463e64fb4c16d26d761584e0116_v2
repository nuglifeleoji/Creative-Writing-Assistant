，后军报说：“甘松诸寨，尽被金城太守杨欣烧毁了。”维大惊，急令副将虚立旗号，与邓艾相拒。维自撤后军，星夜来救甘松，正遇杨欣。欣不敢交战，望山路而走。维随后赶来。将至山岩下，岩上木石如雨，维不能前进。比及回到半路，蜀兵已被邓艾杀败。魏兵大队而来，将姜维围住。\n\n    维引众骑杀出重围，奔入大寨坚守，以待救兵。忽然流星马到，报说：“钟会打破阳安关，守将蒋舒归降，傅佥战死，汉中已属魏矣。乐城守将王含，汉城守将蒋斌，知汉中已失，亦开门而降。胡济抵敌不住，逃回成都求援去了。”维大惊，即传令拔寨。\n\n    是夜兵至疆川口，前面一军摆开，为首魏将，乃是金城太守杨欣。维大怒，纵马交锋，只一合，杨欣败走，维拈弓射之，连射三箭皆不中。维转怒，自折其弓，挺枪赶来。战马前失，将维跌在地上。杨欣拨回马来杀姜维。维跃起身，一枪刺去，正中杨欣马脑。背后魏兵骤至，救欣去了。维骑上从马，欲待追时，忽报后面邓艾兵到。维首尾不能相顾，遂收兵要夺汉中。哨马报说：“雍州刺史诸葛绪已断了归路。”维乃据山险下寨。魏兵屯于阴平桥头。维进退无路，长叹曰：“天丧我也！”副将宁随曰：“魏兵虽断阴平桥头，雍州必然兵少，将军若从孔函谷，径取雍州，诸葛绪必撤阴平之兵救雍州，将军却引兵奔剑阁守之，则汉中可复矣。”维从之，即发兵入孔函谷，诈取雍州。细作报知诸葛绪。绪大惊曰：“雍州是吾合守之地，倘有疏失，朝廷必然问罪。”急撤大兵从南路去救雍州，只留一枝兵守桥头。姜维入北道，约行三十里，料知魏兵起行，乃勒回兵，后队作前队，径到桥头，果然魏兵大队已去，只有些小兵把桥，被维一阵杀散，尽烧其寨栅。诸葛绪听知桥头火起，复引兵回，姜维兵已过半日了，因此不敢追赶。却说姜维引兵过了桥头，正行之间，前面一军来到，乃左将军张翼、右将军廖化也。维问之，翼曰：“黄皓听信师巫之言，不肯发兵。翼闻汉中已危，自起兵来，时阳安关已被钟会所取。今闻将军受困，特来接应。”遂合兵一处，前赴白水关。化曰：“今四面受敌，粮道不通，不如退守剑阁，再作良图。”维疑虑未决。\n######################\nOutput:",
