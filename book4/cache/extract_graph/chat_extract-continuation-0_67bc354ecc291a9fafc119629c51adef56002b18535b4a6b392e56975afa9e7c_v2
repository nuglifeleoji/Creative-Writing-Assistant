\n　　顺便说说，高朗的父亲是这个省会城市的副市长；他爷爷就是中央那位大名鼎鼎的高老。高步杰老汉现在是中纪委常委。这样说来，高朗实际上也是原西人，和晓霞是同乡。不过，他在北京爷爷膝下长大，上大学时才考到这个城市。但他从来没有回过原西县，故乡观念十分淡薄。他可以说是一个“完整”的北京人。 \n　　晓霞现在已经和高朗握过了手。他们相跟着出了候机室，来到外面的广场上。 \n　　高朗是带着市政府的小车来接她的。他看来情绪很高涨，似乎专意为接她而打扮了一下，皮凉鞋闪闪发光；笔挺的西裤，雪白的短袖衫，脖项里打一条深红色领带。晓霞看他这一身装束忍不住想笑——他几乎象国际旅行社的导游或高级宾馆的侍应生了！ \n　　小车飞快地驶出机场内那条足有五华里长的林荫大道，然后加入到大街上洪流一般的汽车和行人之中。 \n　　车速慢下来了，透过车窗，都市五光十色的景象在缓缓流动。两边商店的大玻璃橱窗中，假时装模特儿带着永远不变的微笑，在机械地作三百六十度的旋转。大街上行走的人们都已经换上了夏装；浓密的中国槐下，姑娘们五彩斑斓的花裙子飘飘曳曳，象孔雀尾巴一般耀眼夺目。四面八方传来录音机播放的刺耳的流行歌和电子音乐。 \n　　“我算得很准，知道你今天回来，而且是坐飞机回来！”高朗仰靠在后车座舒适的椅背上，用略带北京土味的普通话说。“谢谢……最近有什么重要新闻？我可是几天没看报了！”她岔开了话题。 \n　　“国内新闻嘛，总就是那些工农业简报！最重要的新闻是，六月十四号世界杯足球赛开幕式上，比利时队以一比零战胜了上届冠军阿根廷队。唉，阿根廷算上倒霉透顶了！就在输球的同一天，他们驻马尔维纳斯群岛的军事长官梅嫩德斯将军打起白旗，向英国军队投降了！” \n　　“是吗？还有什么重要新闻？” \n　　“另外嘛……红色高棉又在磅湛省打死了十几个越军。”他们都笑了。 \n　　汽车驶过繁华的解放大道，在鼓楼旁他们熟悉的“黑天鹅”酒店前停下来，高朗已经在这里请她吃过两次饭——他看来今天又要在这里款待她了。说实话，她现在可没什么兴致在这里吞咽这顿山珍海味。 \n　　但她不好拒绝热忱的高朗。她隐隐地感到，她是否应该和他进行一次不很愉快的谈话了？当然不是今天！ \n　　她尽量不使高朗看出她的\n######################\nOutput:",
