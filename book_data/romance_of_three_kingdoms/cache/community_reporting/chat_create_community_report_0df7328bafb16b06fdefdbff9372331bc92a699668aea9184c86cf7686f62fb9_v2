This connection to Cao Cao places 曹璜 within a significant lineage, as Cao Cao was a key player in the events leading to the fragmentation of the Han dynasty and the rise of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nCao Huan's ascension to the throne was orchestrated by Sima Zhao, who sought to consolidate power and legitimize his rule through the establishment of a puppet emperor. This political maneuvering was characteristic of the tumultuous era in which they lived, marked by shifting allegiances and the struggle for control over the remnants of the Han dynasty. As emperor, 曹璜's reign was largely influenced by Sima Zhao, who effectively controlled the government while 曹璜 occupied the ceremonial role of emperor.\n\nIn summary, 曹璜 is a significant historical figure as the grandson of Cao Cao and the emperor established by Sima Zhao, reflecting the intricate power dynamics of his time.\",2\r\n2309,景元元年,\"景元元年 marks the year when 曹璜 was established as emperor, following the events of 曹髦's assassination.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4102,姜维,铁笼山,姜维's forces besieged 司马昭 at 铁笼山,71\r\n4211,东吴,石头城,石头城 is the location where Eastern Wu leaders meet to discuss military support for 诸葛诞,55\r\n4228,寿春,魏,\"魏 is besieging 寿春, aiming to capture the city\",37\r\n4203,诸葛诞,魏,诸葛诞 served as a general in Wei and was involved in the political dynamics of the state,36\r\n4226,全祎,司马昭,\"全祎 surrenders to 司马昭, indicating a shift in loyalty from Wu to Wei\",31\r\n4056,司马昭,胡遵,\"司马昭 appointed 胡遵 as the vanguard in the military campaign against Wu, showing a command relationship.\",30\r\n4232,司马昭,文虎,\"文虎, alongside文鸯, opposed司马昭's military actions, showing their resistance\",30\r\n4292,司马昭,晋公,司马昭's actions are aimed at consolidating power to become 晋公,30\r\n4458,司马昭,晋王,司马昭 is granted the title of晋王 for his military achievements,30\r\n4461,司马昭,司马攸,\"司马攸 is the younger son of司马昭, indicating a direct familial relationship\",30\r\n237,洛阳,迁都,\"迁都 signifies the political shift from 洛阳, which has been the capital for over two centuries, to 长安\",24\r\n4202,贾充,诸葛诞,\"贾充's visit to 诸葛诞 was a covert operation to assess his loyalty, indicating a relationship of suspicion\",13\r\n4293,曹髦,贾充,\"曹髦 confronts 贾充, who is aligned with 司马昭, indicating a direct conflict\",12\r\n4216,王基,朱异,王基 leads the Wei forces against 朱异's Wu forces in battle,11\r\n4229,寿春,粮食,The lack of 粮食 in 寿春 is a critical factor affecting the defense against Wei,10\r\n4295,曹髦,潜龙诗,潜龙诗 reflects 曹髦's predicament and the political atmosphere of his reign,8\r\n4298,成济,曹髦,\"成济 was the warrior who executed the order to kill 曹髦, leading to his own demise.\",8\r\n4300,曹髦,太傅司马孚,\"太傅司马孚 mourned 曹髦's death and sought to honor him, indicating his loyalty and respect for the emperor.\",8\r\n4301,曹髦,偏殿,\"曹髦's body was kept in 偏殿 after his assassination, indicating the aftermath of the coup.\",8\r\n4217,王基,陈骞,陈骞 serves as the deputy vanguard under 王基 in the battle,7\r\n4220,朱异,安丰,朱异's forces retreat to 安丰 after facing defeat,7\r\n4303,王经,东市,王经 and his family were executed in 东市 as a consequence of their loyalty to 曹髦.,4\r\n4304,曹璜,景元元年,\"曹璜's ascension to the throne marked the beginning of 景元元年, following the political upheaval.\",3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
