\n　　在孙少安意气风发干“大事业”的时候，他的生意人朋友胡永合路过石圪节，听说了他的情况，就专门来拜访他。永合看了这个砖厂的阵势，问：“这砖厂赚了钱，你还准备干什么？” \n　　少安还没来得及想更长远的事，就说：“到时再看吧，说不定还可以办个什么罐头加工厂……” \n　　胡永合不以为然地笑了，说：“那算个什么气派？咱们农民不能光满足办个什么小厂子；咱们应该干更大的事。别看现在把政策给咱放宽了，其实呀，咱们土包子农民在这社会上还没什么地位！钱赚到一定的程度，拿一把票子活着也没滋味！” \n　　“那你的意思哩！”少安一时倒不能明白永合说的这些话。“咱们要出大名！要往外面扬！叫全中国都知道有你我这样的农民！” \n　　“怎个扬法？” \n　　“比如，咱们也可以参加它文化上的事。文化上容易出名。只要出了名，手里又有钱，咱们就不能在它政府里坐一把交椅？哼，说不定将来县委县政府都叫咱承包了呢！”少安对抱负非凡的永合笑了笑，问他：“你说文化上的事咱怎么能插进去腿？” \n　　“我最近在省电视台认识了一位导演，请他在最好的馆子里吃了一顿，成了朋友。我们已经商量好，由我牵头找些农民企业家出钱，拍电视连续剧《三国演义》！刘备，关公，张飞，鲁智深，曹操，这些人你又都知道，红火着哩！你要是愿意，也入个股！” \n　　“我那点钱……”少安难为情地说着，用手掌揩了揩永合溅在他脸上的唾沫星子。 \n　　“钱主要有我哩！你多少出点，在电视剧后面挂个名字，全中国也就知道你了……你如果同意，今冬我带你去一趟省城，见见那位电视台的导演。这也是见世面嘛！怎样？”胡永合问他。 \n　　尽管听起来是些云里雾里的事，但少安又不好拒绝胡永合的好意。他忘不了，在他最倒霉的关键时刻，正是这个人为他伸出了救援之手。哪怕这纯粹是件吃亏事，他也得答应他——他向来是个讲义气的人！ \n　　少安只好为胡永合应承下来。说实话，他自己也被胡永合煽得心里怪热乎的。如果真的投上点资，参加拍《三国演义》电视剧，自己的名字也就能上电视台。再说，电视剧不一定就是赔钱生意！如果赔钱，精明人胡永合也不会白把票子扔给电视台的！ \n　　胡永合和他说定这件事后，声称还要给县委书记张有智汇报他的“计划”，就坐进那辆大卡车的驾驶楼去了原西县城。 \n
