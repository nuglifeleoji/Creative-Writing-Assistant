He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.\nOnce he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland—to rest and restore himself—into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.\nHe lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.\n“You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,” Stilgar had explained. “You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you.”\nWith abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper’s latch. The clapper began revolving and the summons drummed through the sand, a measured “lump... lump...lump....”\nHe straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar’s words: “Judge the line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an unseen approach to a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it before you see it.”\nAnd Chanit’s words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him overcame her, filled his mind: “When you take your stand along the maker’s path, you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand. Hide beneath your cloak and become a little dune in your very essence.”\nSlowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had been taught.\nIt came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently he saw the faraway outline of the creature’s track against the dawnlight and realized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of one this size. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the rise of the sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain.\nThis is nothing | have seen by vision or in life, Paul cautioned himself. He hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand, caught up entirely by the rushing needs of this moment.\n“Control the coinage and the courts—let the rabble have the rest.” Thus the Padishah Emperor advised you. And he tells you: “If you want profits, you must rule.” There is truth in these words, but | ask myself: “Who are the rabble and who are the ruled?”\n—MUAD'DIB’S SECRET MESSAGE TO THE LANDSRAAD FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA thought came unbidden to Jessica’s mind: Paul will be undergoing his sandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but it’s obvious.\nAnd Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.\nJessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the night’s classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had enjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place had thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand, multicolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that she had come to associate with a sense of security.\nYet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place. It was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.\nA faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber. Jessica knew it for a birth\ncelebration, probably Subiay’s. Her time was near. And Jessica knew she'd see the baby soon enough—a blue-eyed cherub brought to the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would be at the celebration and would report on it.\nIt was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn't have started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave raids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.\nJessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and the dangers he faced— the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural dangers of the desert—makers and thirst and dust chasms.\nShe thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen endured.\nA dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup upon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.\nAn offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.\nShe took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society of our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? | could alter any poison now before it did me harm, of course, but the donor doesn’t realize this.\nShe drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents—hot and delicious.\nAnd she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift—with only a slight tinge of fear.\nAnother element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had thought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism.\nAnd the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.\nHas Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He’s capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable.\nThe waiting.\nIt’s the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the dreariness of the waiting overcomes you.\nThere was all manner of waiting in their lives.\nMore than two years we’ve been here, she thought, and twice that number at least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.\n“Reverend Mother?”\nThe voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other woman in Paul’s menage.\n“Yes, Harah.”\nThe hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch sandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders. Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an insect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were drawn into an intense frown.\nBehind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.\nSeeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia’s resemblance to Paul at that age—the same wide-eyed solemnity to her questing look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle differences, too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child—little more than a toddler—carried herself with a calmness and awareness beyond her years. Adults were Shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of words\nbetween the sexes. Or they’d catch themselves listening to her half-lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two-year-old had ever encountered.\nHarah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.\n“Alia.” Jessica motioned to her daughter.\nThe child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her mother’s hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had shared since before Alia’s birth. It wasn’t a matter of shared thoughts—although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing the spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate awareness of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-simpatico that made them emotionally one.\nIn the formal manner that befitted a member of her son’s household, Jessica said: “Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?”\nWith the same traditional formality, she said: “Subakh un nar. | am well.” The words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.\nJessica sensed amusement from Alia.\n“My brother’s ghanima is annoyed with me,” Alia said in her half-lisp.\nJessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah—ghanima. In the subtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant “something acquired in battle” and with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its original\npurpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.\nHarah scowled at the child. “Don’t try to insult me, child. | know my place.”\n“What have you done this time, Alia?” Jessica asked.\nHarah answered: “Not only has she refused to play with the other children today, but she intruded where....”\n“I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay’s child being born,” Alia said. “It’s a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he’d cried long enough—”\n“She came out and touched him,” Harah said, “and he stopped crying. Everyone knows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he’s in sietch because he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr.”\n“He'd cried enough,” Alia said. “I just wanted to feel his spark, his life. That’s all. And when he felt me he didn’t want to cry anymore.”\n“It’s just made more talk among the people,” Harah said.\n“Subiay’s boy is healthy?” Jessica asked. She saw that something was troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.\n“Healthy as any mother could ask,” Harah said. “They know Alia didn’t hurt him. They didn’t so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and was happy. | was....” Harah shrugged.\n“It’s the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?” Jessica asked. “It’s the way she speaks of things\nbeyond her years and of things no child her age could know—things of the past.”\n“How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?” Harah demanded.\n“But he does!” Alia said. “Subiay’s boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting.”\n“Alia!” Jessica said. “I warned you.”\n“But, Mother, | saw it and it was true and....”\nJessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah’s face. What have I borne? Jessica asked herself.
