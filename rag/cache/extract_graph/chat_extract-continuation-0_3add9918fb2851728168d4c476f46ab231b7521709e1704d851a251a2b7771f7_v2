All of this is truth, as you well know.”\n“Yes, Lord.”\nMemory supplied the fanatic emphasis in Nayla’s response. She would obey.\n“If possible, provide opportunities for Siona and Duncan Idaho to be alone together,” he said.\n“Yes, Lord.”\nLet propinguity take its usual course, he thought.\nHe broke contact with Nayla, thought for a moment, then sent for the commander of his plaza forces. The bashar\narrived presently, her dark uniform stained and dusty, evidence of gore still on her boots. She was a tall, bone-thin woman with age lines which gave her aquiline features an air of powerful dignity. Leto recalled her troop-name, lylyo, which meant “Dependable” in Old Fremen. He called her, however, by her matronymic, Nyshae, “Daughter of Shae,” which set a tone of subtle intimacy for this meeting.\n“Rest yourself on a cushion, Nyshae,” he said. “You have been working hard.”\n“Thank you, Lord.”\nShe sank onto the red cushion which Hwi had used. Leto noted the fatigue lines around Nyshae’s mouth, but her eyes remained alert. She stared up at him, eager to hear his words.\n“Matters are once more tranquil in my City.” He made it not quite a question, leaving the interpretation to Nyshae.\n“Tranquil but not good, Lord.”\nHe glanced at the gore on her boots.\n“The street in front of the Ixian Embassy?”\n“It is being cleansed, Lord. Repairs already are under way.”\n“The plaza?”\n“By morning, it will appear as it has always appeared.”\nHer gaze remained steady on his face. Both of them knew he had not yet reached the nubbin of this interview. But Leto now identified a thing lurking within Nyshae’s expression.\nPride in her Lord!\nFor the first time, she had seen the God Emperor kill. The seeds of a terrible dependency had been planted. /f disaster threatens, my Lord will come. That was how it appeared in her eyes. She would no longer act with complete independence, taking her power from the God Emperor and being personally responsible for the use of that power. There was something possessive in her expression. A terrible death-machine waited in the wings, available at her summons.\nLeto did not like what he saw, but the damage had been done. Any remedies would require slow and subtle pressures.\n“Where did the attackers get lasguns?” he asked.\n“From our own stores, Lord. The Arsenal Guard has been replaced.”\nReplaced. It was a euphemism with a certain nicety. Errant Fish Speakers were isolated and reserved until Leto found a problem which required Death Commandos. They would die gladly, of course, believing that thus they expiated their sin. And even the rumor that such berserkers had been dispatched could quiet a trouble spot.\n“The arsenal was breached by explosives?” he asked.\n“Stealth and explosives, Lord. The Arsenal Guard was careless.”\n“The source of the explosives?”\nSome of Nyshae’s fatigue was visible in her shrug.\nLeto could only agree. He knew he could search out and identify those sources, but it would serve little purpose. Resourceful people could always find the ingredients for homemade explosives—common things such as sugar and bleaches, quite ordinary oils and innocent fertilizers, plastics and solvents and extracts from the dirt beneath a manure pile. The list was virtually endless, growing with each addition to human experience and knowledge. Even a society such as the one he had created, one which tried to limit the admixture of technology and new ideas, had no real hope of totally eliminating dangerously violent small weapons. The whole idea of controlling such things was chimera, a dangerous and distracting myth. The key was to limit the desire for violence. In that respect, this night had been a disaster.\nSo much new injustice, he thought.\nAs though she read his thought, Nyshae sighed.\nOf course. Fish Speakers were trained from childhood to avoid injustice wherever possible.\n“We must see to the survivors in the populace,” he said. “See to it that their needs are met. They must be brought to the realization that the Tleilaxu were to blame.”\nNyshae nodded. She had not reached bashar rank while remaining ignorant of the drill. By now, she believed it. Merely by hearing Leto say it, she believed in the Tleilaxu guilt. And there was a certain practicality in her understanding. She knew why they did not slay a// of the Tleilaxu.\nYou do not eliminate every scapegoat.\n“And we must provide a distraction,” Leto said. “Luckily, there may be one ready at hand. | will send word to you after conferring with the Lady Hwi Noree.”\n“The Ixian Ambassador, Lord? Is she not implicated in...”\n“She is entirely guiltless,” he said.\nHe saw belief settle into Nyshae’s features, a readymade plastic underlayment which could lock her jaw and glaze her eyes. Even Nyshae. He knew the reasons because he had created those reasons, but sometimes he felt a bit awed by his creation.\n“I hear the Lady Hwi arriving in my anteroom,” he said. “Send her in as you leave. And, Nyshae.. .”\nShe already was on her feet, but she stood expectantly silent.\n“Tonight, | have elevated Kieuemo to sub-bashar,” he said. “See that it is made official. As for yourself, | am pleased. Ask and you shall receive.”\nHe saw the formula send a wave of pleasure through Nyshae, but she tempered it immediately, proving once more her worth to him.\n“I shall test Kieuemo, Lord,” she said. “If she suits, | may take a holiday. | have not seen my family on Salusa Secundus for many years.”\n“At a time of your own choosing,” he said.\nAnd he thought: Sa/usa Secundus. Of course!\nThat one reference to her origins reminded him of who she resembled: Harq al-Ada. She has Corrino blood. We are Closer relatives than I had thought.\n“My Lord is generous,” she said.\nShe left him then, a new spring in her stride. He heard her voice in the anteroom: “Lady Hwi, our Lord will see you now.”\nHwi entered, backlighted and framed in the archway for a moment, hesitancy in her step until her eyes adjusted to the inner chamber. She came like a moth to the brightness around Leto’s face, looking away only to seek along his shadowy length for signs of injury. He knew that no such sign was visible, but there were still aches and interior tremblings.\nHis eyes detected a slight limp, Hwi favoring her right leg, but a long gown of jade green concealed the injury. She stopped at the edge of the declivity which held his cart, looking directly into his eyes.\n“They said you were wounded, Hwi. Are you in pain?”\n“A cut on my leg below the knee, Lord. A small piece of masonry from the explosion. Your Fish Speakers treated it with a salve which removed the pain. Lord, | feared for you.”\n“And | feared for you, gentle Hwi.”\n“Except for that first explosion, | was not in danger, Lord. They rushed me into a room deep beneath the Embassy.”\nSo she did not see my performance, he thought. / can be thankful for that.\n“| sent for you to ask your forgiveness,” he said.\nShe sank onto a golden cushion. “What is there to forgive, Lord? You are not the reason for...”\n“lam being tested, Hwi.”\n“You?”\n“There are those who wish to know the depths of my concern for the safety of Hwi Noree.”\nShe pointed upward. “That... was because of me?”\n“Because of us.”\n“Oh. But who...”\n“You have agreed to wed me, Hwi, and I...” He raised a hand to silence her as she started to speak. “Anteac has told us what you revealed to her, but this did not originate with Anteac.”\n“Then whois...”\n“The who is not important. It is important that you reconsider. | must give you this opportunity to change your mind.”\nShe lowered her gaze.\nHow sweet her features are, he thought.\nIt was possible for him to create only in his imagination an entire human lifetime with Hwi. Enough examples lay in the welter of his memories upon which to build a fantasy of wedded life. It gathered nuances in his fancy—small details of mutual experience, a touch, a kiss, all of the sweet Sharings upon which arose something of painful beauty. He ached with it, a pain far deeper than the physical reminders of his violence at the Embassy.\nHwi lifted her chin and looked into his eyes. He saw there a compassionate longing to help him.\n“But how else may | serve you, Lord?”\nHe reminded himself that she was a primate, while he no longer was fully primate. The differences grew deeper by the minute.\nThe ache remained within him.\nHwi was an inescapable reality, something so basic that no word could ever fully express it. The ache within him was almost more than he could bear.\n“|I love you, Hwi. | love you as a man loves a woman... but it cannot be. That will never be.”\nTears flowed from her eyes. “Should | leave? Should | return to |x?”\n“They would only hurt you, trying to find out what went wrong with their plan.”\nShe has seen my pain, he thought. She knows the futility and frustration. What will she do? She will not lie. She will not say she returns my love as a woman to a man. She recognizes the futility. And she knows her own feelings for me—compassion, awe, a questioning which ignores fear.\n“Then | will stay,” she said. “We will take such pleasure as we can from being together. | think it is best that we do this. If it means we should wed, so be it.”\n“Then | must share knowledge with you which I have Shared with no other person,” he said. “It will give you a power over me which...”\n“Do not do this, Lord! What if someone forced me to...”\n“You will never again leave my household. My quarters here, the Citadel, the safe places of the Sareer—these will be your home.”\n“As you will.”\nHow gentle and open her quiet acceptance, he thought.\nThe aching pulse within him had to be calmed. In itself, it was a danger to him and to the Golden Path.\nThose clever Ixians!\nMalky had seen how the all-powerful were forced to contend with a constant siren song—the will to self-delight.\nConstant awareness of the power in your slightest whim.\nHwi took his silence to be uncertainty. “Will we wed, Lord?”\n“Yes.”\n“Should anything be done about the Tleilaxu stories which...”\n“Nothing.”\nShe stared at him, remembering their earlier conversation. The seeds of dissolution were being planted.\n“It is my fear, Lord, that | will weaken you,” she said.\n“Then you must find ways to strengthen me.”\n“Can it strengthen you if we diminish belief in the God Leto?”\nHe heard a hint of Malky in her voice, that measured weighing which had made him so revoltingly charming. We never completely escape the teachers of our childhood.\n“Your question begs the answer,” he said. “Many will continue to worship according to my design. Others will believe the lies.”\n“Lord... would you ask me to lie for you?”\n“Of course not. But I will ask you to remain silent when you\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NAYLA<|>PERSON<|>Nayla is a fanatically loyal follower of Leto, willing to obey his commands without question\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a person of interest to Leto, who wants her to interact with Duncan Idaho\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a key figure in Leto's plans, to be paired with Siona\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto, the God Emperor, is the central authority figure with immense power and influence\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NYSHAE<|>PERSON<|>Nyshae is the dependable commander of Leto's plaza forces, of Corrino blood\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>PERSON<|>Hwi Noree is the Ixian Ambassador and Leto's love interest, whom he plans to wed\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIUEEMO<|>PERSON<|>Kieuemo is a newly promoted sub-bashar under Nyshae's command\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN EMBASSY<|>GEO<|>The Ixian Embassy is a location where an explosion occurred, linked to a plot against Leto\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>GEO<|>Salusa Secundus is the homeworld of Nyshae's family\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>GEO<|>The Citadel is one of Leto's secure residences where Hwi will live\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARER<|>GEO<|>The Sareer is a safe region under Leto's control\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are blamed for the attack and used as scapegoats by Leto\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's loyal military force, trained from childhood\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEATH COMMANDOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Death Commandos are used by Leto for high-risk missions\")  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBASSY ATTACK<|>EVENT<|>The attack on the Ixian Embassy involved explosives and lasguns, leading to casualties\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAYLA<|>LETO<|>Nayla is a fanatically obedient follower of Leto<|>9\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Leto wants Siona and Duncan Idaho to interact closely<|>7\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NYSHAE<|>LETO<|>Nyshae is a trusted commander under Leto, with Corrino blood ties<|>8\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>LETO<|>Hwi Noree is Leto's love interest and future bride, despite their differences<|>9\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIUEEMO<|>NYSHAE<|>Kieuemo is a newly promoted sub-bashar under Nyshae's command<|>6\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIAN EMBASSY<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Tleilaxu are blamed for the attack on the Ixian Embassy<|>5\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NYSHAE<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>Nyshae's family resides on Salusa Secundus<|>4\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TLEILAXU<|>Leto uses the Tleilaxu as scapegoats for the attack<|>6\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>LETO<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's loyal military force<|>8\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEATH COMMANDOS<|>LETO<|>The Death Commandos are used by Leto for dangerous missions<|>7\")  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>IXIAN EMBASSY<|>Hwi Noree was present at the Ixian Embassy during the attack<|>5\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
