It is cited by Leto II in discussions about societal structures, highlighting its role as a philosophical and theological foundation for governance and cultural norms. Additionally, the text holds influence over the Bene Gesserit, shaping their traditions and even their methods of timekeeping, suggesting its deep integration into their practices. The Orange Catholic Bible is also weaponized rhetorically, as seen when Paymon quotes it against Alia, demonstrating its use as a tool for ideological confrontation.  \n\nDespite these varied applications, the text remains a cohesive religious and cultural artifact, serving as both a spiritual guide and a political instrument. Its multifaceted role underscores its importance in shaping belief systems, power dynamics, and societal frameworks within the *Dune* saga.
