\n　　本来已经没一点力气了，但她仍然拼命把这死沉沉的躯体，拉到了房中的脚地上。李向前已经醉得不省人事，身上、脸上和头发上都糊满了肮脏的呕吐物，发出一股刺鼻的臭味。 \n　　她现在开始连扯带剥，把他的脏外衣扔在一边。但她无论如何再没有力气把他弄到床上去。她干脆把他大床上的被褥拉到地下铺开，把这个沉重而失去知觉的人硬拖进去。她给他盖好被子，又看见他脸上也糊满了泥土和脏物，就拿热毛巾给他擦干净。她安顿他睡下后，就拉灭电灯，回到她的小床上睡了…… \n　　第二天早晨，李向前醒来后，看见他睡在脚地上，身上还盖着被子。老半天，他才回忆起这以前的种种事情。他现在明白，他躺着的这个舒适而暖和的安乐窝，是润叶为他搞的。 \n　　他的心“呼”一下热了！ \n　　他立刻从地上跳起来，冲动地向妻子扑了过去。 \n　　在他还没来得及搂住她的时候，他的脸上就“啪”地又挨了一记耳光。 \n　　他象木雕一般呆立在脚地上，看见妻子把收拾好的一个提包拎在手上，连看也没看他一眼，就打开门头也不回地走了…… \n                  第46章\n　　如果不查看有关的统计数字，谁能想象来黄土高原的千山万壑中，究竟有多少个村落和人家呢？旅人们！你们也许跑了不少路，但对这块和阳光同色的土地所留下的印象，恐怕仍然是豹之一斑。 \n　　黄土，这个名词在中国的史籍中早已有之。地质学研究表明，黄土是第四纪陆相黄色含石英、长石、云母等六十多种矿物的钙质胶结而成的粉砂质土状沉积物。在占全球陆地十分之一的黄土覆盖面积中，我国包括陕西、山西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、河南、内蒙七省（区）面积就达五十九万平方公里；分布之广，堆积厚度之大，类型之完整，为世界所罕见。在我国，自西北向东南，戈壁——沙漠——黄土，依次呈带状序列分布，因而在黄土成因史上，被认为是由风力远距离搬运而来。另外还有水成和成土作用的不同学说。由于黄土堆积物中蕴含着丰富的第四纪信息，有关的科学工作者往往有意识地把黄土作为一个独特的研究对象——第四纪代表地球发展史上最新的一个纪。
