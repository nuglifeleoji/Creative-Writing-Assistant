The library: holophotos and triphotos of the Atreides Duke, Leto |. Teg’s resemblance was not an accident: a bit taller but otherwise it was all there—that long, thin face with its high- bridged nose, the renowned Atreides charisma...\nTeg!\nHe remembered the old Bashar’s last gallant stand in the Gammu night.\nWhere am I?\nTormsa had brought him here. They had been moving along an overgrown track on the outskirts of Ysai. Barony. It started to snow before they were two hundred meters up the track. Wet snow that clung to them. Cold, miserable snow that set their teeth chattering within a minute. They paused to bring up their hoods and close the insulated jackets. That was better. But it would be night soon. Much colder.\n“There is a shelter of sorts up ahead,” Tormsa said. “We will wait there for the night.”\nWhen Duncan did not speak, Tormsa said: “It won’t be warm but it will be dry.”\nDuncan saw the gray outline of the place in about three hundred paces. It stood out against the dirty snow some two stories tall. He recognized it immediately: a Harkonnen counting outpost. Observers here had counted (and sometimes killed) the people who passed. It was built of native dirt turned into one giant brick by the simple expedient of preforming it in mud bricks and then superheating it with a wide-bore burner, the kind the Harkonnens had used to control mobs.\nAs they came up to it, Duncan saw the remains of a full- field defensive screen with fire-lance gaps aimed at the approaches. Someone had smashed the system a long time ago. Twisted holes in the field net were partly overgrown with bushes. But the fire-lance gaps remained open. Oh, yes —to allow people inside a view of the approaches.\nTormsa paused and listened, studying their surroundings with care.\nDuncan looked at the counting station. He remembered them well. What confronted him was a thing that had sprouted like a deformed growth from an original tubular seed. The surface had been baked to a glassine finish. Warts\nand protrusions betrayed where it had been superheated. The erosion of eons had left fine scratches in it but the Original shape remained. He looked upward and identified part of the old suspensor lift system. Someone had jury- rigged a block and tackle to the outbar.\nSo the opening through the full-field screen was of recent making.\nTormsa disappeared into this opening.\nAs though a switch had been thrown, Duncan’s memory vision changed. He was in the no-globe’s library with Teg. The projector was producing a series of views through modern Ysai. The idea of modern took on an odd overtone for him. Barony had been a modern city, if you thought of modern as meaning technologically uniform up to the norms of its time. It had relied exclusively on suspensor guide- beams for transport of people and material—all of them high up. No ground-level openings. He was explaining this to Teg.\nThe plan translated physically into a city that used every possible square meter of vertical and horizontal space for things other than movement of goods and humans. The guide-beam openings required only enough head room and elbow room for the universal transport pods.\nTeg spoke: “The ideal shape would be tubular with a flat top for the ‘thopters.”\n“The Harkonnens preferred squares and rectangles.”\nThat was true.\nDuncan remembered Barony with a clearness that made him shiver. Suspensor tracks shot through it like worm holes —straight, curved, flipping off at oblique angles... up, down, sideways. Except for the rectangular absolute imposed by Harkonnen whim, Barony was built to a particular population-design criterion: maximum stuffing with minimum expenditure of materials.\n“The flat top was the only human-oriented space in the damned thing!” He remembered telling that to Teg and\nLucilla both.\nUp there on top were penthouses, guard stations at all the edges, at the ’thopter pads, at all the entries from below, around all of the parks. People living on the top could forget about the mass of flesh squirming in close proximity just below them. No smell or noise from that jumble was allowed on top. Servants were forced to bathe and change into sanitary clothing before emerging.\nTeg had a question: “Why did that massed humanity permit itself to live in such a crush?”\nThe answer was obvious and he explained it. The outside was a dangerous place. The city’s managers made it appear even more dangerous than it actually was. Besides, few in there knew anything about a better life Outside. The only better life they knew about was on top. And the only way up there was through an absolutely abasing servility.\n“It will happen and there’s nothing you can do about it!”\nThat was another voice echoing in Duncan’s skull. He heard it clearly.\nPaul!\nHow odd it was, Duncan thought. There was an arrogance in the prescient like the arrogance of the Mentat seated in his most brittle logic.\nI never before thought of Paul as arrogant.\nDuncan stared at his own face in a mirror. He realized with part of his mind that this was a pre-ghola memory. Abruptly, it was another mirror, his own face but different. That darkly rounded face had begun to shape into the harsher lines it could have if it matured. He looked into his own eyes. Yes, those were his eyes. He had heard someone describe his eyes once as “cave sitters.” They were deeply inset under the brows and riding atop high cheeks. He had been told it was difficult to determine if his eyes were dark blue or dark green unless the light were just right.\nA woman said that. He could not remember the woman.\nHe tried to reach up and touch his hair but his hands would not obey. He remembered then that his hair had been bleached. Who did that? An old woman. His hair was no longer a cap of dark ringlets.\nThere was the Duke Leto staring at him in the doorway to the dining room on Caladan.\n“We will eat now,” the Duke said. It was a royal command saved from arrogance by a faint grin that said: “Somebody had to say it.”\nWhat is happening to my mind?\nHe remembered following Tormsa to the place where Tormsa said the no-ship would meet them.\nIt was a large building bulking in the night. There were several smaller outbuildings below the larger structure. They appeared to be occupied. Voices and machine sounds could be heard in them. No faces showed at the narrow windows. No door opened. Duncan smelled cooking as they passed the larger of the outbuildings. This reminded him that they had only eaten dry strips of leathery stuff that Tormsa called “travel food” that day.\nThey entered the dark building.\nLight flared.\nTormsa’s eyes exploded in blood.\nDarkness.\nDuncan looked at a woman’s face. He had seen a face like this one before: a single tride taken from a longer holo sequence. Where was that? Where had he seen that? It was an almost oval face with just a small widening at the brow to mar its curved perfection.\nShe spoke: “My name is Murbella. You will not remember that but | share it now as | mark you. | have selected you.”\nI do remember you, Murbella.\nGreen eyes set wide under arched brows gave her features a focal region that left chin and small mouth for later examination. The mouth was full-lipped and he knew it could become pouting in repose.\nThe green eyes stared into his eyes. How cold that look. The power in it.\nSomething touched his cheek.\nHe opened his eyes. This was no memory! This was happening to him. It was happening now!\nMurbella! She had been here and she had left him. Now she was back. He remembered awakening naked on a soft surface ...a sleeping pad. His hands recognized it. Murbella unclothed just above him, green eyes staring at him with a terrible intensity. She touched him simultaneously in many places. A soft humming issued from between her lips.\nHe felt the swift erection, painful in its rigidity.\nNo power of resistance remained in him. Her hands moved over his body. Her tongue. The humming! All around him, her mouth touching him. The nipples of her breasts grazed his cheeks, his chest. When he saw her eyes, he saw conscious design.\nMurbella had returned and she was doing it once more!\nOver her right shoulder, he glimpsed a wide plaz window —Lucilla and Burzmali behind that barrier. A dream? Burzmali pressed his palms against the plaz. Lucilla stood with folded arms, a look of mingled rage and curiosity on her face.\nMurbella murmured in his right ear: “My hands are fire.”\nHer body hid the faces behind the plaz. He felt the fire wherever she touched him.\nAbruptly, the flame engulfed his mind. Hidden places within him came alive. He saw red capsules like a string of gleaming sausages passing before his eyes. He felt feverish. He was an engorged capsule, excitement flaring throughout his awareness. Those capsules! He knew them! They were himself... they were...\nAll of the Duncan Idahos, original and the serial gholas flowed into his mind. They were like bursting seedpods\ndenying all other existence except themselves. He saw himself crushed beneath a great worm with a human face.\n“Damn you, Leto!”\nCrushed and crushed and crushed... time and again.\n“Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!.. .”\nHe died under a Sardaukar sword. Pain exploded into a bright glare swallowed by darkness.\nHe died in a ‘thopter crash. He died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin. He died and died and died.\nAnd he lived.\nThe memories flooded him until he wondered how he could hold them all. The sweetness of a newborn daughter held in his arms. The musky odors of a passionate mate. The cascade of flavors from a fine Danian wine. The panting exertions of the practice floor.\nThe axlotl tanks!\nHe remembered emerging time after time: bright lights and padded mechanical hands. The hands rotated him and, in the unfocused blurs of the newborn, he saw a great mound of female flesh—monstrous in her almost immobile grossness...a maze of dark tubes linked her body to giant metal containers.\nAxlotl tank?\nHe gasped in the grip of the serial memories that cascaded into him. Al/ of those lives! All of those lives!\nNow, he remembered what the Tleilaxu had planted in him, the submerged awareness that awaited only this moment of seduction by a Bene Gesserit Imprinter.\nBut this was Murbella and she was not Bene Gesserit.\nShe was here, though, ready at hand and the Tleilaxu pattern took over his reactions.\nDuncan hummed softly and touched her, moving with an agility that shocked Murbella. He should not be this responsive! Not this way! His right hand fluttered against the lips of her vagina while his left hand caressed the base of her spine. At the same time, his mouth moved gently\nover her nose, down to her lips, down to the crease of her left armpit.\nAnd all the time he hummed softly in a rhythm that pulsed through her body, lulling ... weakening...\nShe tried to push away from him as he increased the pace of her responses.\nHow did he know to touch me there at just that instant? And there! And there! Oh, Holy Rock of Dur, how does he know this?\nDuncan marked the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the Atreides Duke, known for his long, thin face, high-bridged nose, and renowned Atreides charisma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is an old Bashar who made a last gallant stand in the Gammu night)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TORMSA<|>PERSON<|>Tormsa is a guide who brought Duncan to a shelter and planned to meet a no-ship)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola with multiple past lives, remembering events from his previous incarnations and current experiences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YSAI<|>GEO<|>Ysai is a city on Gammu with overgrown tracks and outskirts where Duncan and Tormsa traveled)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARONY<|>GEO<|>Barony is a modern city with suspensor guide-beams for transport, built to maximize population density)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNEN COUNTING OUTPOST<|>GEO<|>A Harkonnen structure used for counting and sometimes killing people, built of native dirt turned into brick)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is a planet where Duke Leto commanded Duncan to eat in a dining room)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a woman with green eyes who selected Duncan and triggered his serial memories through seduction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILLA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a woman who observed Duncan and Murbella with a look of mingled rage and curiosity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURZMALI<|>PERSON<|>Burzmali is a person who pressed his palms against a plaz window while observing Duncan and Murbella)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is a prescient figure remembered by Duncan, described as having arrogance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AXLOTL TANKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Axlotl tanks are Tleilaxu devices used for creating gholas, linked to female flesh and metal containers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is an organization whose Imprinters can trigger submerged memories in gholas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a group known for creating gholas and planting submerged awareness in them)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LETO<|>Duncan remembers Duke Leto commanding him to eat on Caladan<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TEG<|>Duncan shared memories and explanations with Teg about Barony and Harkonnen structures<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TORMSA<|>Tormsa guided Duncan to a shelter and planned to meet a no-ship with him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MURBELLA<|>Murbella triggered Duncan's serial memories through seduction<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LUCILLA<|>Lucilla observed Duncan and Murbella with mixed emotions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BURZMALI<|>Burzmali observed Duncan and Murbella through a plaz window<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PAUL<|>Duncan remembered Paul as a prescient figure with arrogance<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>AXLOTL TANKS<|>Duncan remembered emerging from axlotl tanks multiple times<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Bene Gesserit Imprinters can trigger submerged memories in gholas like Duncan<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Tleilaxu created Duncan as a ghola and planted submerged awareness in him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Murbella is not Bene Gesserit but performed an Imprinter's role on Duncan<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARKONNEN COUNTING OUTPOST<|>BARONY<|>The Harkonnen counting outpost is a remnant of Harkonnen control in Barony<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
