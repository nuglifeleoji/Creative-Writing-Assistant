\n　　等众人先后回到窑里后，见全家的主事人金光亮一声不吭地把一些纸钱和黄表纸放在一个竹蓝里，并且拾起了两碟祭坟的茶饭。 \n　　一家人看这情景，一个个都面面相觑。 \n　　金光亮脸色阴沉地扫视了一下全家老少，然后开言道：“今天是咱们家的高兴日子，应该让地下的祖先也长出上一口气，自从老人入土之后，我们这些活着的不孝子孙，怕连累自己，还没到坟上去祭奠一次呢。现在二锤要去参军我们什么也不再怕了，今天咱们到祖坟上去，给老人们敬供上一点心意，让他们在地下也平一平心！另外，也给田福堂和孙玉亭这些人看看！二锤，你过来把篮子提上，咱们一块到你爷坟上去！” \n　　金二锤立在门前，抠着手指甲，为难地看着父亲，嗫嚅着说：“爸，咱们不要这样……” \n　　“怎？”金光亮歪着嘴巴问。 \n　　“我爷旧社会的确剥削过穷人，我现在参加了解放军，借此再去祭奠他，政治影响不好……” \n　　金二锤话还没说完，金光亮就走前一步，伸出巴掌在儿子脸上打了一记耳光，喝问道：“你说你去不去？”金二锤眼里旋转泪水，说：“不……” \n　　金光亮眼里闪着凶光，问：“那是不是你爷？”“是……” \n　　“那你为什么不上他的坟？” \n　　“……” \n　　金光亮又伸开巴掌朝儿子脸上抡过来，结果被光明和光辉挡住了。二锤他妈已经和几个娃娃在锅台后面哭成了一堆。 \n　　金光亮怒气冲冲，扑着还要过来打儿子，他的两个弟弟一人扯着他的一条胳膊，在旁边好言相劝。金光明说：“大哥，你的心情我们都能理解，但你也要理解二锤呢。虽说现在政策宽了，我们也还得谨慎一些为好……”金光辉也凑话说：“老人已经是入土的人了，也不在乎咱们这些事。他们在地下也能体谅活人的难处哩……” \n　　“放你们的臭屁！”情绪疯狂的金光亮对两个弟弟破口大骂，他甩开这两个捉他的人，提起那个篮子，一个人恼悻悻地出了门。 \n　　临近中午的时候，在小学后面金家祖坟那里，金光亮一个人跪在老地主的坟前，哭丧着脸开始了他的祭祖仪式。与此同时，他的儿子不听家人的劝说，强行骑着他二爸的自行车，提前回了原西县武装部。几天来弥漫在这一大家人中的欢乐情绪顿时烟消云散，而重新被一种不愉快的气氛笼罩了……
