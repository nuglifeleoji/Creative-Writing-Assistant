蓝轩宇给自己制定了一个目标，首先就是要在这一个半月之内把魂力突破到十四级。然后就是全方位的提升。\n\n    家庭修炼室最多能够提供三倍重力，娜娜在当初教导蓝轩宇的时候，就已经开始让他尝试一倍重力的练习了。蓝轩宇决定在这个假期，至少要增加到一点五倍重力。让自己的体魄变得更强。\n\n    之前这一个学期，可能是那些珍稀食材的原因，他长高了也健壮了。比同龄孩子都要高大一些。所以，他的魂力虽然提升的并不快，可他却能明显感觉到自己的身体素质提高的非常迅速。尤其是力量、速度这些方面。而且，他对水元素的控制也越来越熟练了，已经可以做一些十分精细的事情。\n\n    他十分严格的按照计划在度过这个假期，因为有了丈夫准确的回归时间，南澄的心情自然也就好得多了，假期带着蓝轩宇出去玩了几次，虽然时间都不长，但过得也还快乐。\n\n    一个半月的时间，很快就要到了。\n\n    蓝轩宇顺利的晋升了十四级魂力，而且是在假期后不久就晋升成功了。实际年龄只有七岁的他，这还是一个相当可以的成绩。\n\n    可是，眼看着就要开学了，蓝潇却还没回来。时间的度过，让南澄又开始有些焦躁了。\n\n    蓝轩宇听到最多的，就是妈妈在念叨着，怎么还不回来、怎么还不回来……\n\n    “明天就要开学了，东西都收拾好了吗？”南澄收拾完厨房，来到蓝轩宇的卧室问道。\n\n    只是一个假期，她就觉得儿子似乎又长高了一点。这变化的速度可着实是很快啊！\n\n    “都收拾好了。妈妈，我今晚打算在修炼室冥想呢。”蓝轩宇现在已经不经常睡觉了。按照娜娜的教导，冥想的时间越长，尤其是能够进入深度冥想的话，会对修炼有非常大的帮助作用。对于娜娜的教导，他都记得特别清楚。\n\n    “嗯，那就好。那你早点去吧。”南澄微笑着摸了摸儿子的面颊。\n\n    “嗯呢。”\n\n    “咔嚓、咔嚓！”正在这时，门响传来。\n\n    母子俩不约而同的都向外面看去，然后再面面相觑。\n\n    下一刻，蓝轩宇已经率先大叫起来：“爸爸——”一个纵跃，他就从床上跳了下来，就连南澄都只是觉得眼前一花，蓝轩宇就已经冲出了房间。\n\n    蓝潇才刚刚进门，就觉得一道黑影扑了上来，再加上那一声呼唤，自然不用去认真看就张开了双臂。\n\n    蓝轩宇像个猴子似的瞬间挂在了蓝潇身上，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a seven-year-old boy who is focused on improving his soul
