That suited his needs. They must not learn the full extent of my abilities. Not yet.\n“You would disguise an attack force?”\nBellonda came through the door as Odrade was speaking and growled an objection while sitting: “Impossible! They'll have recognition codes and secret signals for—”\n“Let me decide that, Bell, or remove me from command.”\n“This is the Council!” Bellonda said. “You don’t—”\n“Mentat?” He looked fully at her, the Bashar apparent in his gaze.\nWhen she fell silent, he said: “Don’t question my loyalty! If you would weaken me, replace me!”\n“Let him have his say.” That was Tam. “This isn’t the first Council where the Bashar has appeared as our equal.”\nBellonda lowered her chin a fractional millimeter.\nTo Odrade, Teg said, “Avoiding warfare is a matter of intelligence—the gathered variety and intellectual power.”\nThrowing our own cant at us! She heard Mentat in his voice and Bellonda obviously heard this as well. Intelligence and intelligence: the doubled view. Without it, warfare often occurred as an accident.\nThe Bashar sat silently, letting them stew in their own historical observations. The urge to conflict went far deeper than consciousness. The Tyrant had been right. Humankind acted as “one beast.” The forces impelling that great collective animal went back to tribal days and beyond, as did so many forces to which humans responded without thinking.\nMix the genes.\nExpand Lebensraum for your own breeders.\nGather the energies of others: collect slaves, peons, servants, serfs, markets, workers... The terms often were interchangeable.\nOdrade saw what he was doing. Knowledge absorbed from the Sisterhood helped make him the incomparable Mentat Bashar. He held these things as instincts. Energy- eating drove war’s violence. This was described as “greed, fear (that others will take your hoard), power hunger” and on and on into futile analyses. Odrade had heard these even from Bellonda who obviously was not taking it well that a subordinate should remind them of what they already knew.\n“The Tyrant knew,” Teg said. “Duncan quotes him: ‘War is behavior with roots in the single cell of the primeval seas. Eat whatever you touch or it will eat you.’”\n“What do you propose?” Bellonda at her most snappish.\n“A feint at Gammu, then strike their base on Junction. For that we need first-hand observations.” He stared steadily at Odrade.\nHe knows! The thought flared in Odrade’s mind.\n“You think your studies of Junction when it was a Guild base are still accurate?” Bellonda demanded.\n“They haven't had time to change the place much from what | stored here.” He tapped his forehead in an odd parody of the Sisterhood’s gesture.\n“Englobement,” Odrade said.\nBellonda looked at her sharply. “The cost!”\n“Losing everything is more costly,” Teg said.\n“Foldspace sensors don’t have to be large,” Odrade said. “Duncan would set them to create a Holzmann explosion on contact?”\n“The explosions would be visible and would give us a trajectory.” He sat back and looked at an indefinite area on Odrade’s rear wall. Would they accept it? He dared not frighten them with another display of wild talent. If Bell knew he could see the no-ships!\n“Do it!” Odrade said. “You have the command. Use it.”\nThere was a distinct sense of chuckling from Taraza in Other Memories. Give him his head! That’s how | got such a great reputation!\n“One thing,” Bellonda said. She looked at Odrade. “You're going to be his spy?”\n“Who else can get in there and transmit observations?”\n“They'll be monitoring every means of transmission!”\n“Even the one that tells our waiting no-ship we have not been betrayed?” Odrade asked.\n“An encrypted message hidden in the transmission,” Teg said. “Duncan has devised an encryption that would take months to break but we doubt they'll detect its presence.”\n“Madness,” Bellonda muttered.\n“I met an Honored Matre military commander on Gammu,” Teg said. “Slack when it came to necessary\ndetails. | think they’re overconfident.”\nBellonda stared at him and there was the Bashar staring back at her out of a child’s innocent eyes. “Abandon all sanity ye who enter here,” he said.\n“Get out of here, all of you!” Odrade ordered. “You have work to do. And Miles...”\nHe already had slid off the chair but he stood there looking much as he always had when waiting for Mother to tell him something important.\n“Did you refer to the lunacy of dramatic events that warfare always amplifies?”\n“What else? Surely you didn’t think | referred to your Sisterhood!”\n“Duncan plays this game sometimes.”\n“| don’t want us catching the Honored Matre madness,” Teg said. “It is contagious, you know.”\n“They've tried to control the sex drive,” Odrade said. “That always gets away from you.”\n“Runaway lunacy,” he agreed. He leaned against the table, his chin barely above the surface. “Something drove those women back here. Duncan’s right. They’re looking for something and running away at the same time.”\n“You have ninety Standard days to get ready,” she said. “Not one day more.”\nIsh yara al-ahdab hadbat-u. (A hunchback does not see his own hunch.— Folk Saying.) Bene Gesserit Commentary: The hunch may be seen with the aid of mirrors but mirrors may show the whole being.\n—THE BASHAR TEG\nt was a weakness in the Bene Gesserit that Odrade knew\nthe entire Sisterhood soon must recognize. She gained no consolation from having seen it first. Denying our deepest resource when we need it most! The Scatterings had gone beyond the ability of humans to assemble the experiences in manageable form. We can only extract essentials, and that is a matter of judgment. Vital data would remain dormant in great and small events, accumulations called instinct. So that was it finally—they must fall back on unspoken knowledge.\nIn this age, the word “refugees” took on the color of its pre-space meaning. Small bands of Reverend Mothers sent out by the Sisterhood held something in common with old scenes of displaced stragglers trudging down forgotten roads, pitiful belongings bound in bits of cloth, wheeled on decrepit prams and toy wagons, or piled atop lopsided vehicles, remnant humanity clinging to the outsides and densely packed within, every face blank with despair or heated by desperation.\nSo we repeat history and repeat it and repeat it.\nAs she entered a tubeslot shortly before lunch, Odrade’s thoughts clung to her Scattered Sisters: political refugees, economic refugees, pre-battle refugees.\nIs this your Golden Path, Tyrant?\nVisions of her Scattered ones haunted Odrade as she entered Central’s Reserved Dining Room, a place only Reverend Mothers might enter. They served themselves here at cafeteria lines.\nIt had been twenty days since she had released Teg to the cantonment. Rumors were flying in Central, especially among Proctors, although there still was no sign of another vote. New decisions must be announced today and they would have to be more than naming the ones who would accompany her to Junction.\nShe glanced around the dining room, an austere place of yellow walls, low ceiling, small square tables that could be latched in rows for larger groups. Windows along one side revealed a garden court under a translucent cover. Dwarf apricots in green fruit, lawn, benches, small tables. Sisters ate outside when sunlight poured into the enclosed yard. No sunlight today.\nShe ignored a cafeteria line where a place was being made for her. Later, Sisters.\nAt the corner table near the windows reserved for her, she deliberately moved the chairs. Bell’s brown chairdog pulsed faintly at this unaccustomed disturbance. Odrade sat with her back to the room, Knowing this would be interpreted correctly: Leave me to my own thoughts.\nWhile she waited, she stared out at the courtyard. An enclosing hedge of exotic purple-leaved shrubs was in red flower—giant blossoms with delicate stamens of deep yellow.\nBellonda arrived first, dropping into her chairdog with no comment on its new position. Bell frequently appeared untidy, belt loose, robe wrinkled, bits of food on the bosom. Today, she was neat and clean.\nNow, why is that?\nBellonda said, “Tam and Sheeana will be late.”\nOdrade accepted this without stopping her study of this different Bellonda. Was she a bit slimmer? There was no way\nto insulate a Mother Superior completely from what went on within her sensory area of concerns but sometimes pressures of work distracted her from small changes. These were a Reverend Mother’s natural habitat, though, and negative evidence was as illuminating as positive. On reflection, Odrade realized that this new Bellonda had been with them for several weeks.\nSomething had happened to Bellonda. Any Reverend Mother could exercise reasonable control over weight and figure. A matter of internal chemistry—banking fires or letting them burn high. For years now, rebellious Bellonda had flaunted a gross body.\n“You've lost weight,” Odrade said.\n“Fat was beginning to slow me too much.”\nThat had never been sufficient reason for Bell to change her ways. She had always compensated with speed of mind, with projections and faster transport.\n“Duncan really got to you, didn’t he?”\n“I’m not a hypocrite nor criminal!”\n“Time to send you to a punishment Keep, | guess.”\nThis recurrent humorous thrust usually annoyed Bellonda. Today, it did not arouse her. But under pressure of Odrade’s stare, she said: “If you must know, it’s Sheeana. She has been after me to improve my appearance and broaden my circle of associates. Annoying! I’m doing it to shut her up.”\n“Why are Tam and Sheeana late?”\n“Reviewing your latest meeting with Duncan. | have severely limited who has access to it. No telling what will happen when it becomes general knowledge.”\n“As it will.”\n“Inevitable. | only buy us time to prepare.”\n“| did not want it suppressed, Bell.”\n“Dar, what are you doing?”\n“I will announce that at a Convocation.”\nNo words but Bellonda glared her surprise.\n“A Convocation is my right,” Odrade said.\nBellonda leaned back and stared at Odrade, assessing, questioning . . . all without words. The last Convocation of the Bene Gesserit had been at the Tyrant’s death. And before that, at the Tyrant’s seizure of power. A Convocation had not been thought possible since Honored Matres attacked. Too much time taken from desperate labors.\nPresently, Bellonda asked: “Will you risk bringing Sisters from our surviving Keeps?”\n“No. Dortujla will represent them. There is precedent, as you know.”\n“First, you free Murbella; now it’s a Convocation.”\n“Free? Murbella is tied by chains of gold. Where would she go without her Duncan?”\n“But you've given Duncan freedom to leave the ship!”\n“Has he?”\nBellonda said, “You think that information from the ship’s armory is all he’ll take?”\n“I know it.”\n“lam reminded of Jessica turning her back on the Mentat who would have killed her.”\n“The Mentat was immobilized by his own beliefs.”\n“Sometimes the bull gores the matador, Dar.”\n“More often he does not.”\n“Our survival\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Reverend Mother in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, known for her sharp objections and rebellious nature.
