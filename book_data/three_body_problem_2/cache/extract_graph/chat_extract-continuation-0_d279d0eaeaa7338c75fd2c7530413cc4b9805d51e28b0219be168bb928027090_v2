们只能等待，即使队形都排好了，摄影师还要等待航天服推进器喷出的白雾散去。但目标毕竟是悬浮在太空中的，位置很容易在失重中漂移，这时子弹不但会错过目标，还可能伤及无辜。\n　　无辜，他要杀的这三个人也是无辜的，在三体危机出现前的岁月里，他们用现在看来十分微薄的投入，小心翼翼如履薄冰地开启了太空时代的黎明……然而正是那段经历禁锢了他们的思想，为了得到能够在恒星际航行的飞船，必须消灭他们！而他们的死，也应该看作为人类太空事业做出的最后贡献。\n　　事实上，章北海故意使几颗子弹稍稍走偏，期望能击中目标之外的人，最理想的情况是致伤，但如果真的多死一两个人，他也不在意，这样做的目的是为了减少可能出现的怀疑。\n　　章北海举着已经打空的枪，透过瞄准镜冷静地观察着，他做好了失败的准备，如果那样，他将若无其事地开始寻找第二次机会。\n　　时间在一秒一秒地流逝，终于，目标被击中的迹象出现了。章北海并没有看到航天服上的弹洞，但有白色的气体喷出。紧接着，在第一排和第二排之间，爆发出了一团更大的白汽，可能是子弹穿透目标后又击穿了背后的喷射推进器。对子弹的威力他是有信心的，丝毫没有减速的陨石子弹击中目标时，就如同枪口顶着目标开枪一样。他看到，一个目标的头盔面罩突然布满了裂纹，变得不透明了，但能看到血从内部飞溅在上面，然后血随着从弹洞中泄漏的气体喷到外面，很快冷凝成雪花状的冰晶。章北海在观察中很快确定，被击中的有包括那三个目标在内的五人，每个目标的中弹至少在五发以上。\n　　透过几个人的透明面罩，章北海看到他们都在惊叫，从口型上看出他们喊的话中肯定有一个他期待的词：“陨石雨！”\n　　合影者们的喷射推进器都全功率打开，他们拖着条条白雾迅速返回，很快由那个圆形人口进入了黄河站。章北海注意到，那五名中弹者是被别人拖回去的。\n　　章北海开动喷射推进器，向一号基地方向加速，此时他的心就像周围空寂的太空一般寒冷而平静。他知道，航天界那咕个关键人物的死，并不能保证无工质辐射推进飞船成为主要研究方向，但他做了自己能做的，不管以后发生什么。在父亲从冥冥中投下的目光中，他可以安心了。\n　　几乎就在章北海返回一号基地的同时，在地球上的互联网中，三体虚拟世界的荒漠上很快聚集起一群人，讨论刚刚发生的事。\n　　“智子这一次传回的信息很完整，否则我们真不敢相信他真那么做了。”秦始皇说，同时用长剑在地上随意地划着，显示出他心里的不安\n######################\nOutput:",
