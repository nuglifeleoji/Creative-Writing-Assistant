The relationship between the two is characterized by mutual respect and affection, with Futars actively seeking out their Handlers. Together, they form a formidable partnership, possibly aligned against the **Honored Matres**, a group that fears the Futars. The Futars' presence is known to attract Handlers, suggesting a deep, possibly instinctual bond between the two. While their exact purpose remains unclear, their collaboration implies a strategic alliance, with the Handlers overseeing the Futars' actions, whether for combat, tracking, or other specialized roles.
