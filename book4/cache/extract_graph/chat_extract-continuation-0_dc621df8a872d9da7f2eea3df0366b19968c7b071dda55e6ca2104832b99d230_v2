干家务活——担水、劈柴，到矸石山上去捡煤。每当进入这个小院，他就象回到自己家。王世才一家人也把他当自家人看待，有个什么活，就不见外也让他帮助做；有个什么好吃的，也吼喊着非让他吃不行。 \n　　少平后来才知道，师傅也是三十岁上才成家的。当地找不下老婆，他只好回到老家河南，在亲戚的带助下，费了好大的劲，才找到了惠英。惠英尽管比师傅小八岁，结婚后一直实心疼爱师傅。她出身农家，里外活都很麻利。虽然识字不多，可人很精明。至于漂亮，那在整个黑户区都是很出名的。 \n　　孙少平感到庆幸的是，他来煤矿半年多，就结识了如此好的一家人。也许这是命里有缘，使他不论走到何处，都会遇上对他特别关照的人家。在黄原时，有阳沟曹书记两口子，在这里，又有王世才一家人。是啊，在他艰难的生活历程中，如果没有这些好人，他的日子将会更加难过！ \n　　这一天他回宿舍，屋里其他几个人都挤眉弄眼对他说，昨夜他下井后，来个很俊的“娘们”，把他床头和搭在铁丝上的脏衣服都收拾走了。 \n　　和他同屋的这些家伙都开始下井劳动，因此现在敢用粗言俗语对他说话。 \n　　少平发现，他脱下的脏衣服就是不见了踪影。不过，他立刻明白，同屋人所说的“娘们”就是惠英嫂。是的，是她拿走给他洗去了。 \n　　他心里不由一热。 \n　　“这个骚娘们是谁？”有人用脏话问他。 \n　　“少放臭屁！她是我们班长的老婆！”少平瞪了一眼那个问话的小子。 \n　　“噢……王世才那么个狗熊样，能找了这么个俊老婆，比他妈唱戏的都漂亮！” \n　　少平无法阻止这些人用肮脏的粗话评说惠英嫂，说粗话是这个行道的家常便饭。他自己尽管反感，有时嘴里也会不由冒出一句来…… \n　　转眼就到了六月。 \n　　山野里的绿色越来越深了。碧蓝的天空通常没有一丝云彩，人的视野可及十分遥远的地平线。地面上，人们已经身着很单薄的衣衫了。 \n　　不过，井下一年四季都是潮湿阴冷的。即是二伏天，不干活还得披上棉袄。 \n　　这天因为发生了冒顶，少平他们直至上午十点钟才把活干完。尽管大家累得半死不活，好在还没造成什么伤亡。 \n　　他们几十个人，象苦役犯一般拖着疲惫不堪的身子，来到井口下面，等待上罐。所有的人脸上看不见一丝笑影，也不说任何话。身上都象墨汁泼过，只有从眼白辨认出这是一群活物。 \n　　少平最后一罐上井。
