She is also a close friend of Chani and a guardian of Alia, advocating for her within the sietch while expressing concern over Alia's unconventional behavior. Harah's strong personality is evident in her discussions of tribal politics, succession, and her firm stance on justice, as seen when she speaks about not forgiving and forgetting.  \n\nHer relationship with Paul is one of mutual respect; she is considered trustworthy by him and serves as a member of his household.
