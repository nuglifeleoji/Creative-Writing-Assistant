\n　　米家镇已故米阴阳的儿子继承了父业，现在是周围最有名气的阴阳——此时他手拿切菜刀，走到棺木前象征性的在鸡头旁砍了砍，然后把那只将属于自己的老公鸡扔在地上，背过身嘴里念了一会咒语，喊道：“起殡！” \n　　三声铳炮轰鸣，吹鼓手奏起哀乐，棺木被八个人抬起来。金强扛着引魂幡打头，后面是举课幡和童男童女的孝子。接下来是吹手，然后直系孝子手扯棺木上的纤帐，一路哭说着出了院门。岁数纸和老太太生前的枕头在院畔上点燃了。与此同时，双水村所有人家的院畔上都点起一堆避邪的火。 \n　　棺木在坡下作程式性停留，女孝子们在这里烧过纸磕过头后，就返回家不再去坟地。 \n　　重新起棺后，只留了男性孝子。吹鼓手也停止了奏乐。人们在雪地上艰难地行进着，好不容易才把这分量很重的柏木棺抬到金家祖坟。 \n　　在墓地上，阴阳成了主要角色。孝子们都怀着敬畏的感情，由年轻的米阴阳用罗盘指导着将棺木吊入墓穴。这里的一招一式，稍有不慎，按迷信说法，都会给后辈人招致灾祸。坟堆起后，米阴阳念招魂曲：“……每日儿烧香在佛前，三载父母早升天。千千诸佛生喜欢，万万菩萨授香烟……啊哈！朱砂硼砂磨合砂……磨合钵罗啊，钵弥罗……罗罗罗饭钵……钵钵罗饭罗……”米阴阳一念完，在坟旁划一十字，再划一圆圈，又向坟堆撒了五谷，葬礼就全部结束了。 \n　　母亲的丧事全部办完后，金俊武夫妇累得睡了两天两夜。从大哥一家三口被捕到母亲去世，使他们处于一连串的事变之中，身体和精神全有点撑不住了。他们知道，老母亲正是因为俊文家的祸事才一病不起的。 \n　　现在，这一切都完结了。在这对夫妇的内心深处，倒象是收割完一季庄稼，可以长长地出一口气，他们剩下的唯一心病，就是侄儿金强的婚姻问题。在这件事上，李玉玲和丈夫的熬煎是一致的——他们都喜爱和同情可怜的强娃。 \n　　但是，俊武夫妇并不知道，事情在孙家那里有了突破性的转机。 \n　　春节前的几天，孙卫红又一次向父母提出她要和金强结婚；而且强硬地表示，不管大人同意不同意，他们赶春节就到石圪节乡政府去领结婚证呀！\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>米家镇<|>GEO<|>米家镇 is a location
