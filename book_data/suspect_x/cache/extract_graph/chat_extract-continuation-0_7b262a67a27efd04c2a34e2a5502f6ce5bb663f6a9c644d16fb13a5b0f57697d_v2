We do not have time to consider all ramifications of our plight. We no longer can Say, ‘If this happens, then that must surely follow, and in such a case, our moves must be so andsoandso...’”\nBellonda actually chuckled. “Oh, my! The ordinary mind is such a clutter. And | must not demand what we all need and cannot have—sufficient time for every plan.”\nIt was Bellonda-Mentat speaking, telling them she knew she was flawed by pride in her ordinary mind. What a badly organized, untidy place that was. /magine what the non- Mentat puts up with, imposing so little order. She reached across the aisle and patted Odrade’s shoulder.\n“It’s all right, Dar. l'II behave.”\nWhat would an outsider think, seeing that exchange? Odrade wondered. All four of them acting in concert for the needs of one Sister.\nFor the needs of Murbella’s Agony, as well.\nPeople saw only the outside of this Reverend Mother mask they wore.\nWhen we must (which is most of the time these days) we function at astonishing levels of competence. No pride in that; a simple fact. But let us relax and we hear gibberish at the edges as ordinary folk do. Ours merely has more volume. We live our lives in little congeries like anyone else. Rooms of the mind, rooms of the body.\nBellonda had composed herself, hands clasped in her lap. She knew what Odrade planned and kept it to herself. It was a trust that went beyond Mentat Projection into something more basically human. Projection was a marvelously adaptable tool but a tool nonetheless. Ultimately, all tools depended on the ones who used them. Odrade was at a loss how to show her thanks without reducing trust.\nI must walk my tightrope in silence.\nShe sensed the chasm beneath her, the nightmare image conjured by these reflections. The unseen hunter with an axe was closer. Odrade wanted to turn and identify the stalker but resisted. / will not make Muad’Dib’s mistake! The prescient warning she had first sensed on Dune in the ruins of Sietch Tabr would not be exorcised until she ended or the Sisterhood ended. Did I create this terrible threat by my\nfears? Surely not! Still, she felt she had stared at Time in that ancient Fremen stronghold as though all past and all future were frozen into a tableau that could not be changed. I must break free of you utterly, Muad’Dib!\nTheir arrival at the Landing Flat pulled her from these fearful musings.\nMurbella waited in rooms Proctors had prepared. At the center was a small amphitheater about seven meters along its enclosing back wall. Padded benches were stepped upward in a steep arc, seating for no more than twenty observers. Proctors had left her without explanation on the lowest bench staring at a suspensor-buoyed table. Straps hung over the sides to confine whoever lay on it.\nMe.\nAn astonishing series of rooms, she thought. She had never before been permitted into this part of the ship. She felt exposed here, even more so than she had under open sky. The smaller rooms through which they had brought her to this amphitheater were clearly designed for medical emergencies: resuscitation equipment, sanitary odors, antiseptics.\nHer removal to this room had been peremptory, none of her questions answered. Proctors had taken her from an advanced acolyte class in prana-bindu exercises. They said only: “Mother Superior’s orders.”\nThe quality of her guardian Proctors told her much. Gentle but firm. They were here to prevent flight and to make sure she went where ordered. / won’t try to escape!\nWhere was Duncan?\nOdrade had promised he would be with her for the Agony. Did his absence mean this was not to be her ultimate trial? Or had they concealed him behind some secret wall through which he could see and not be seen?\nI want him at my side!\nDidn’t they know how to rule her? Certainly they did!\nThreaten to deprive me of this man. That’s all it takes to hold me and satisfy me. Satisfy! What a useless word. Complete me. That’s better. | am less when we're apart. He knows it, too, damn him.\nMurbella smiled. How does he know it? Because he is completed in the same way.\nHow could this be love? She felt no weakening from the tugs of desire. Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres alike said love weakened. She felt strenghened by Duncan. Even his Small attentions were strengthening. When he brought her a steaming cup of stimtea in the morning, it was better coming from his hands. Perhaps we have something more than love.\nOdrade and companions entered the amphitheater at the uppermost tier and stood a moment looking down at the figure seated below them. Murbella wore the white-trimmed long robe of a senior acolyte. She sat with elbow on knee, chin resting on fist, her attention concentrated on the table.\nShe knows.\n“Where is Duncan?” Odrade asked.\nAt her words, Murbella stood and turned. The question confirmed what she had suspected.\n“lIl find out,” Sheeana said and left them.\nMurbella waited in silence, matching Odrade stare for stare.\nWe must have her, Odrade thought. Never had the Bene Gesserit need been greater. What an insignificant figure Murbella was down there to carry so much in her person. The almost oval face with its widening at the brows revealed new Bene Gesserit composure. Widely set green eyes, arched brows—no squinting—no more orange. Small mouth —no more pouting.\nShe is ready.\nSheeana returned with Duncan at her side.\nOdrade spared him a brief glance. Nervous. So Sheeana had told him. Good. That was an act of friendship. He might\nneed friends here.\n“You will sit up here and remain here unless | call you,” Odrade said. “Stay with him, Sheeana.”\nWithout being told, Tamalane flanked Duncan, one of them on each side. At a gentle gesture from Sheeana, they sat.\nBellonda beside her, Odrade descended to Murbella’s level and went to the table. Oral syringes on the far side were ready to lift into position but remained empty. Odrade gestured at the syringes and nodded to Bellonda, who went out a side door in search of the Suk Reverend Mother in charge of spice essence.\nMoving the table away from the back wall, Odrade began laying out straps and adjusting pads. She moved methodically, checking that everything had been provided on the small ledge beneath the table. Mouth pad to keep the Agonized One from biting her tongue. Odrade felt it to be Sure it was strong. Murbella had a muscular jaw.\nMurbella watched Odrade work, keeping silent, trying to make no disturbing noises.\nBellonda returned with spice essence and proceeded to fill the syringes. The poisonous essence had a pungent odor —bitter cinnamon.\nCatching Odrade’s attention, Murbella said, “I’m grateful that you’re supervising this yourself.”\n“She’s grateful!” Bellonda sneered, not looking up from her work.\n“Leave this to me, Bell.” Odrade kept her attention on Murbella.\nBellonda did not pause but something withdrawn took over her movements. Bellonda effacing herself? It never ceased to astonish Murbella how acolytes effaced themselves when they entered Mother Superior’s presence. There but not there. Murbella had never quite achieved this even when she left probation and entered advanced status. Bellonda, too?\nStaring hard at Murbella, Odrade said: “I know what reservations you hold in your breast, limits you place on your commitment to us. Well and good. | make no argument about that because, by and large, your reservations are very little different from those held by any of us.”\nCandor. “The difference, if you would know it, is in the sense of responsibility. | am responsible for my Sisterhood... as\nmuch of it as still survives. They are a deep responsibility and one | sometimes look at with a jaundiced eye.”\nBellonda sniffed.\nOdrade appeared not to notice this as she continued. “The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood has gone somewhat sour since the Tyrant. Our contact with your Honored Matres has not improved matters. Honored Matres have the stench of death and decadence about them, going downhill into the great silence.”\n“Why do you tell me these things now?” Fear in Murbella’s voice.\n“Because, somehow, the worst of Honored Matre decadence did not touch you. Your spontaneous nature, perhaps. Although that has been dampened somewhat since Gammu.”\n“Your doing!”\n“We've just taken a little wildness out of you, given you a better balance. You can live longer and healthier because of it.”\n“If | survive this!” Jerk of her head toward the table behind her.\n“Balance is what | want you to remember, Murbella. Homeostasis. Any group choosing suicide when it has other options does so out of insanity. Homeostasis gone haywire.”\nWhen Murbella looked at the floor, Bellonda snapped: “Listen to her, fool! She’s doing her best to help you.”\n“All right, Bell. This is between us.”\nWhen Murbella continued to stare at the floor, Odrade said: “This is Mother Superior giving you an order. Look at me!”\nMurbella’s head snapped up and she stared into Odrade’s eyes.\nIt was a tactic Odrade had used infrequently but with excellent results. Acolytes could be reduced to hysteria by it and then taught how to deal with their excessive response to emotions. Murbella appeared to be more angered than fearful. Excellent! But now was a time for caution.\n“You have complained about the slow pacing of your education,” Odrade said. “It was done with your needs foremost in our minds. Your key teachers all were chosen for steadiness, none of them impulsive. My instructions were explicit: ‘Don’t give you too many abilities too rapidly. Don’t open a floodgate of powers that might be more than she can handle.’”\n“How do you know what I can handle?” Still angry.\nOdrade only smiled.\nWhen Odrade continued silent, Murbella appeared flustered. Had she made a fool of herself before Mother Superior, before Duncan and these others? How humiliating.\nOdrade reminded herself it was not good to make Murbella too conscious of her vulnerability. A bad tactic just now. No need to provoke her. She had a sharp sense of the german\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Sister who often engages in accusatory behavior and has a Mentat's logical mind, though she acknowledges its flaws.
