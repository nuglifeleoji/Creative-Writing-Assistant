�边问他。“它还没名字。你给它起个名字吧！”他一边说，一边在垒好的狗窝时填进一层柔软的麦秸。惠英嫂也高兴地拿了一些旧棉絮，帮他垫在麦秸上。 \n　　“就叫它小黑子吧！”明明喊叫说。“好，就叫小黑子！这名字很好听！”少平对明明说。这一天，因为家庭增加了一个新成员，三个人的情绪都很好。饭桌上，他们一直在谈论着这个被命名为“小黑子”的家伙。明明顾不得吃自己的饭，蹲在地上为小狗喂食。 \n　　就在这天晚上，少平下井后，却遭遇了一件极不愉快的事。 \n　　当头一茬炮放完，又支护好了顶棚，大伙刚开始攉煤时候，他旁边的安锁子突然大声喊叫说：“哈呀，王世才死了还没多日子，他老婆就撑不住了！” \n　　“那你去解决一下问题嘛！”有人下流地说。 \n　　“轮不上咱！少平比咱年轻足劲，早顶王世才的班了！”掌子面的黑暗中传来一片哄笑声。 \n　　孙少平头“嗡”地响了一声。一种无言的愤怒使他掼下铁锹，走过去几拳就把那个不穿裤子的家伙打倒在了煤堆里。安锁子哇哇乱叫，少平只管在他的光身子上又踢又踏，所有干活的人都笑着，谁也不制止这种殴打——打架在煤矿就象是玩游戏，谁还把这当一回事！ \n　　他扯着他的两条腿，颠倒着把安锁子悬在那个黑色深渊的口上。 \n　　煤溜子在轰隆隆地转动着，煤流象瀑布似地从安锁子身边跌入了那个不见底的黑窟窿里。安锁子吓得杀猪般嚎叫起来——要是少平一松手，他顷刻间就会掉入那个可怕的黑色地狱之中！ \n　　这时候，带班的副区长雷汉义过来了。他也没制止这危险的“把戏”，反而嘿嘿地笑着在旁边说：“好！我还正愁没人顶替王世才当班长哩！孙少平这小子能打架，就能当个好班长！好！把那小子撂下去！” \n　　雷汉义立在一边，乐得只管笑。 \n　　孙少平把安锁子从漏煤眼上拉出来，象死狗一般把他扔在一边…… \n　　少平并没意识到，对安锁子的这次暴力行动，使他无形中在矿工中提高了威信。拳头和力气在井下向来是受尊重的。能打就能干，也就能统帅这群粗野的汉子。雷汉义说的是事实。有一些班长和区队干部就是打架打出来的！ \n　　但是，孙少平虽然打倒了安锁子，可他自己受伤的却是心灵——安锁子的话严重地伤害了他。不仅如此，这也是对惠英嫂和死去的师傅的侮辱。 \n　　在澡堂里换衣服的时候，安锁子\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
