然踏上了进军省城之路，心情倒很有些激动。已经到了这个地步，我们也应该公正地赞扬他的勇敢的进取精神；不管盲目还是失败，只要敢出征的将士，就应该受到敬重。 \n　　胡永合和他商定，到黄原时两个人在他哥胡永州那里住一夜；到铜城时，再拐到大牙湾捎带着看看少安的弟弟。少安也很想见见少平了——弟兄俩见罢面已有好长时间。胡永州如今还当他的包工头，在北关为一家公司盖楼。我们知道的那个可怜的女孩小翠已被他一腿踢到东关暗娼的行列中，最近又为自己物色了一个仍然只有十六岁的小女孩陪他睡觉。 \n　　胡永州大方地在黄原街上最好的餐馆请弟弟和少安吃了一顿酒席。席间，少安从胡氏兄弟的言谈中，才知道他们在南面一个地区当专员的表兄弟凤阁，因为水灾问题，官被撤得一干二净。这兄弟俩在饭桌上大骂了一通他们双水村当大官的田福军。少安当然不解其中之意，只是吃菜喝酒，不插一句话。 \n　　第二天，他们就坐汽车下了铜城；然后在车站广场又买票搭乘东去的一辆运煤车的闷罐客箱。拐到了大牙湾……哥哥意外地来到煤矿，使少平大吃一惊。 \n　　不过，他很快弄明自，不是家里出了什么灾祸。那个家时至今日也常叫人提心吊胆——对突降灾变的心理恐惧象遗传病一样在他身上扎下了根。 \n　　随哥哥而来的另外一个人也叫孙少平吃了一惊；因为他把这个人认成了他曾揍过的包工头胡永州。他也很快弄明白这不是胡永州，而是胡永州的弟弟胡永合。尽管如此，他对这个胡永合一见面就反感。因为是哥哥的朋友，他才竭力克制着厌恶情绪，装出一副热情的样子，请他们吃了饭，又把这家伙安排在矿招待所的一个单间客房里。他和哥哥晚上要拉话，就共同住了一间两张床位的房子。 \n　　吃过晚饭，胡永合早早就睡了。尽管一路上孙少安一再吹嘘他这个弟弟如何有本事，但胡永合连和少平拉两句闲话的兴趣都没有。有个屁本事！有本事还要到煤矿来掏炭？ \n　　少平首先领哥哥到浴池洗了一回澡，他知道哥哥虽然腰缠万贯，但一年也不洗几次澡。一来原西县也没个公众洗澡的地方，二来农村人习惯认为洗澡不只是讲卫生，而是一种不属于他们的奢侈行为，因此平时连想也不想。 \n　　洗澡时正好下井的工人还没上来，一大池水就他们两个人，少平直把他哥的脊背搓得象水萝卜一样红。洗完澡，少平照\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>胡永合<|>PERSON<|>胡永合 is a character who is
