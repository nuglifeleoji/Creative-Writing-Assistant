辐射性质和强度的测量。以下公布的调查结果主要根据以上调查资料综合而成。所公布的调查结果还参考了中国人民解放军各军区医疗机构和医学研究机构的调查结果。在调查过程中，委员会同联合国卫生组织取得了联系，并在该组织的协调下，同74个会员国交换了部分调查资料，所公布的调查结果也参考了这些资料。现在简要播送调查结果：\n　　在1999A出现后的24小时内，我国平均每人所受的电离辐射剂量为146 拉德，辐射的主要成分是来自1999A的高能粒子在大气对流层中产生的次级粒子流，以及直接穿过大气层的γ射线。抽样调查表明，在此剂量的电离辐照下，现有人口的77.94% 已患SLER病。\n　　病情在现有人口的各年龄组分布如下：患者的年龄不低于12岁，在12岁年龄组，患病率为89.26%，13岁以上年龄组全部患SLER病，患病率为100%，在此年龄范围内尚未发现任何幸存者。但在11岁以下的年龄范围，患病率为零，未发现此年龄组的SLER病患者。\n　　灾情在全国地理位置上呈均匀分布。\n　　世界各国的灾情与我国相同。\n　　（以上部分均为中文打字，以下部分为铅笔书写，可能是由于书写者当时的身体状况，字迹模糊，极难辩认。以下的内容已超出了灾情报告的范围）\n　　时间紧迫！没有时间了（无法辩认）……来不及（无法辩认）……11岁以下（无法辩认）……集中孩子在他们中建立各级领导机构以（无法辩认）……各地保持通讯（无法辩认）……以后只（以下全部无法辩认）……\n　　华华念完了，他的声音以光速传向外面的世界。\n　　两个孩子沉默着，他们无法全部理解灾情报告的内容，所能理解的那部分他们的理智也无法接受。至于后面那段神秘的铅笔字，华华把能看清的断断续续地念出来了，但无论是华华还是小梦都竭力不敢猜测它意味着什么。这时计算机在提示：\n　　以上输入已全部以特级功率在本系统所有波段播出。\n　　若继续播出请继续输入，否则在2号终端上键入OFF关闭系统。华华在2号终端上打入了OFF，大屏幕黑了下来，播放系统关闭，计算机对这个大厅中的声音不再有反应了。\n　　“他们都是得的上面说的那种病吗？”小梦看着大厅中的四具尸体说。\n　　“是的。在去年我好象在报纸上看到过介绍这种病的文章，只知道它是很可怕的不治之症。”\n　　“这里能打电话吗，也许咱们能问问医生们。”\n　　“谁知现在还有没有能说话的医生？……看看这些亮着的电脑，也许知道该怎么和外面联系。”\n　　两个孩子挨个儿看那一排计算机终端屏幕，前面三个上显示着天书似的程序代码，但第四个终端屏幕上显示的内容却吸引了他们，上面的显示是这样的：\n　　请输入通行字——\n######################\nOutput:",
