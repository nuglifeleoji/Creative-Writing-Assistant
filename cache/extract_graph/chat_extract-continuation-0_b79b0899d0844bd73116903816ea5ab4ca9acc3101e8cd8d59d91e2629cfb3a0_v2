In the landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say: “I am | because I am here.”\nHis mother had said once: “The people are divided, some of them, in how they think of you.”\nI must be waking from the dream, Paul told himself. For this had happened—these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of the Fremen, these words had passed through reality.\nJessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the Fremen, Paul knew. She didn’t like the fact that people of both sietch and graben referred to Muad’Dib as Him. And she went questioning among the tribes, sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.\nShe had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: “When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong—faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it’s too late.”\nPaul recalled that he had sat there in his mother’s quarters, in the inner chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns out of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her out, noting the way she was always observing—even when her eyes were lowered. Her oval face had new lines in it at the corners of the mouth, but the hair was still like polished bronze. The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their overcasting of spice-imbued blue.\n“The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,” he Said.\n“Nothing about religion is simple,” she warned.\nBut Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: “Religion unifies our forces. It’s our mystique.”\n“You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,” she charged. “You never cease indoctrinating.”\n“Thus you yourself taught me,” he said.\nBut she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been the day of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had understood some of the reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his liaison—the “marriage of youth”—with Chani. But Chani had produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had found herself unable to reject the child with the mother.\nJessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: “You think me an unnatural mother.”\n“Of course not.”\n“| see the way you watch me when I’m with your sister. You don’t understand about your sister.”\n“I know why Alia is different,” he said. “She was unborn, part of you, when you changed the Water of Life. She—”\n“You know nothing of it!”\nAnd Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time, said only: “I don’t think you unnatural.”\nShe saw his distress, said: “There is a thing, Son.”\n“Yes?”\n“I do love your Chani. | accept her.”\nThis was real, Paul told himself. This wasn’t the imperfect vision to be changed by the twistings out of\ntime’s own birth.\nThe reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality began to dip through the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly that he was in a hiereg, a desert camp. Chani had planted their stilltent on flour sand for its softness. That could only mean Chani was nearby—Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.\nNow, he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep.\n“O my soul,\nHave no taste for Paradise this night, And | swear by Shai-hulud\nYou will go there,\nObedient to my love.”\nAnd she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm like the drag of the dunes against the feet:\n“Tell me of thine eyes\nAnd | will tell thee of thy heart. Tell me of thy feet\nAnd | will tell thee of thy hands. Tell me of thy sleeping\nAnd | will tell thee of thy waking. Tell me of thy desires\nAnd | will tell thee of thy need.”\nHe had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent. And he’d thought then of Gurney Halleck. Reminded by the familiar instrument, he had\nthought of Gurney whose face he had seen ina smuggler band, but who had not seen him, could not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the Harkonnens to the son of the Duke they had killed.\nBut the style of the player in the night, the distinctiveness of the fingers on the baliset’s strings, brought the real musician back to Paul’s memory. It had been Chatt the Leaper, captain of the Fedaykin, leader of the death commandos who guarded Muad’Dib.\nWe are in the desert, Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond the Harkonnen patrols. | am here to walk the sand, to lure a maker and mount him by my own cunning that | may be a Fremen entire.\nHe felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the silence surrounding him.\nIt was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the day creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.\n“You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see and know you have no fear,” Stilgar had said. “Thus we turn our time around and set ourselves to sleep this night.”\nQuietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a Slacked stillsuit around his body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So softly he moved, yet Chani heard him.\nShe spoke from the tent’s gloom, another shadow there: “It’s not yet full light, beloved.”\n“Sihaya,” he said, speaking with half a laugh in his voice.\n“You call me your desert spring,” she said, “but this day I’m thy goad. | am the Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed.”\nHe began tightening his stillsuit. “You told me once the words of the Kitab al-lbar,” he said. “You told me: ‘Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and till it.’”\n“lam the mother of thy firstborn,” she agreed.\nHe saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement, securing her stillsuit for the open desert. “You should get all the rest you can,” she said.\nHe recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: “The Sayyadina of the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate.”\nShe slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. “Today, | am both the watcher and the woman.”\n“You should’ve left this duty to another,” he said.\n“Waiting is bad enough at best,” she said. “ld sooner be at thy side.”\nHe kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned and cracked the seal of the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill not-quite- dryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn. With it came the smell of a pre-spice mass, the mass they had detected off to the northeast, and that told them there would be a maker nearby.\nPaul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and stretched the sleep from his muscles. A faint green-pearl luminescence etched the eastern horizon. The tents of his troop were small\nfalse dunes around him in the gloom. He saw movement off to the left—the guard, and knew they had seen him.\nThey knew the peril he faced this day. Each Fremen had faced it. They gave him this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself.\nIt must be done today, he told himself.\nHe thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom—the old men who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle, the old men who listened to him now in council and followed his plans, the men who returned to pay him that highest Fremen compliment: “Your plan worked, Muad’Dib.”\nYet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing that he had never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them.\nHe had not ridden the maker.\nOh, he’d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had not made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the abilities of others. No true Fremen could permit this. Until he did this thing himself, even the great southlands—the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg—were denied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one of the sick and wounded.\nMemory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the night. He saw a strange\nparallel here—if he mastered the maker, his rule was strengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this carried its own measure of command. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great Unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled.\nThe differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him—accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it in situ. Yet, when it was born, when it came into the pressures of reality, the now had its own life and grew with its own subtle differences. Terrible purpose remained. Race consciousness remained. And over all loomed the jihad, bloody and wild.\nChani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him from the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.\n“Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul,” she said.\nHe saw that she was trying to distract him, ease his mind of tensions before the deadly test. It was growing lighter, and he noted that some of his Fedaykin were already striking their tents.\n“I'd rather you told me about the sietch and about our son,” he said. “Does our Leto yet hold my mother in his palm?”\n“It’s Alia he holds as well,” she said. “And he grows rapidly. He’ll be a big man.”\n“What’s it like in the south?” he asked.\n“When you ride the maker you'll see for yourself,” she said.\n“But | wish to see it first through your eyes.”\n“It’s powerfully lonely,” she said.\nHe touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her stillsuit cap. “Why will you not talk about the sietch?”\n“I have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It’s a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are children to train that the tribe’s strength may never be lost.”\n“Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?” he asked.\n“The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food. Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on.”\n“My sister, Alla—is she accepted yet by the people?”\nChani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight.
