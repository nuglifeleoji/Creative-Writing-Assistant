天下之事，孔明曰：“曹操于冀州作玄武池以练水军，必有侵江南之意。可密令人过江探听虚实。”玄德从之，使人往江东探听。\n\n    却说孙权自孙策死后，据住江东，承父兄基业，广纳贤士，开宾馆于吴会，命顾雍、张纮延接四方宾客。连年以来，你我相荐。时有会稽阚泽，字德润；彭城严畯，字曼才；沛县薛综，字敬文；汝阳程秉，字德枢；吴郡朱桓，字休穆；陆绩，字公纪；吴人张温，字惠恕；乌伤骆统，字公绪；乌程吾粲，字孔休：此数人皆至江东，孙权敬礼甚厚。又得良将数人：乃汝南吕蒙，字子明；吴郡陆逊，宇伯言；琅琊徐盛，字文向；东郡潘璋，字文珪；庐江丁奉，字承渊。文武诸人，共相辅佐，由此江东称得人之盛。\n\n    建安七年，曹操破袁绍，遣使往江东，命孙权遣子入朝随驾。权犹豫未决。吴太夫人命周瑜、张昭等面议。张昭曰：“操欲令我遣子入朝，是牵制诸侯之法也。然若不令去，恐其兴兵下江东，势必危矣。”周瑜曰：“将军承父兄遗业，兼六郡之众，兵精粮足，将士用命，有何逼迫而欲送质于人？质一入，不得不与曹氏连和；彼有命召，不得不往：如此，则见制于人也。不如勿遣，徐观其变，别以良策御之。”吴太夫人曰：“公瑾之言是也。”权遂从其言，谢使者，不遣子。自此曹操有下江南之意。但正值北方未宁，无暇南征。\n\n    建安八年十一月，孙权引兵伐黄祖，战于大江之中。祖军败绩。权部将凌操，轻舟当先，杀入夏口，被黄祖部将甘宁一箭射死。凌操子凌统，时年方十五岁，奋力往夺父尸而归。权见风色不利，收军还东吴。\n\n    却说孙权弟孙翊为丹阳太守，翊性刚好酒，醉后尝鞭挞士卒。丹阳督将妫览、郡丞戴员二人，常有杀翊之心；乃与翊从人边洪结为心腹，共谋杀翊。时诸将县令，皆集丹阳，翊设宴相待。翊妻徐氏美而慧，极善卜《易》，是日卜一卦，其象大凶，劝翊勿出会客。翊不从，遂与众大会。至晚席散，边洪带刀跟出门外，即抽刀砍死孙翊。妫览、戴员乃归罪边洪，斩之于市。二人乘势掳翊家资侍妾。妫览见徐氏美貌，乃谓之曰：“吾为汝夫报仇，汝当从我；不从则死。”徐氏曰：“夫死未几，不忍便相从；可待至�\n######################\nOutput:",
