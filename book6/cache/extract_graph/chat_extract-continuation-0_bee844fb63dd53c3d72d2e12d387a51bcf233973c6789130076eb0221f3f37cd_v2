他的话立刻引起了众多军官的附和。\n　　章北海说：“我知道，自己的这番发言有违组织原则，我本人愿意就此承担一切责任，但我认为，不管用什么方式，必须使我们意识到目前情况的严重性。”\n　　常伟思抬起手制止了更多人的发言：“首先，应该肯定章北海同志在工作中表现出来的责任心和忧患意识。失败主义在部队中的存在是事实，我们应该理性地面对，只要敌我双方悬殊的技术差距存在，失败主义就不会消失，靠简单的工作方法是解决不了问题的。这是一项长期细致的工作，应该有更多的沟通和交流。\n　　另外，我也同意刚才有同志提出的：涉及到个人思想方面的问题，以沟通和交流为主。如果有必要反映，还是要通过组织渠道。“\n　　在场的很多军官都橙了一口气，至少在这次会议上，章北海不会提到他们了。\n　　罗辑想象着外面云层之上无边的暗夜，艰难地整理着自己的思绪。不知不觉间，他的思想集中到她身上，她的音容笑貌出现在昏暗中，一种前所未有的悲哀冲击着他的心扉，接踵而来的，是对自己的鄙视，这种鄙视以前多次出现过，但从没有现在这么强烈。你为什么现在才想到她？这之前，对于她的死你除了震惊和恐惧就是为自己开脱，直到现在你发现整个事情与她关系不大，才把自己那比金子还贵重的悲哀给了她一点儿，你算什么东西‘可没办法，我就是这么一个人。\n　　飞机在气流中微微起伏着。罗辑躺在床上有在摇篮中的感觉。他知道自己在婴儿时睡过摇篮，那天，在父母家的地下室，他看到了一张落满灰尘的童床，床的下面就安装有摇篮的弧橇。现在，他闭起双眼想象着那两个为自己轻推摇篮的人，同时自问：自你从那张摇篮中走出来直到现在，除了那两个人，你真在乎过谁吗？你在心灵中真的为谁留下过一块小小的但永久的位置吗？\n　　是的，留下过。有一次，罗辑的心被金色的爱情完全占据，但那却是一次不可思议的经历。\n　　所有那一切都是由白蓉引起的，她是一名写青春小说的作家，虽是业余的但已经小有名气，至少她拿的版税比工资要多。在认识的所有异性中，罗辑与向蓉的交往时间是最长的，最后甚至到了考虑婚姻的阶段。他们之间的感情属于比较昔通常见的那类，谈不上多么投入和铭心刻骨，但他们认为对方适合自己，在一起轻松愉快，尽管两人对婚姻都有一种恐惧感，但也都觉得负责的做法是尝试一下。\n　　在白蓉的要求下，罗辑看过了她的所有作品。虽谈不上是一种享受，但也不像他瞄过几眼的其他此类小说那么折磨人。白蓉\n######################\nOutput:",
