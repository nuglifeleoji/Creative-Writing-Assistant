As 娜娜's guardian, 云琰 is deeply concerned about her well-being, especially in light of 娜娜's recent disappearance. This concern extends to the implications of 娜娜's emotional state on their broader mission, as it directly affects 云琰's responsibilities.\n\n云琰's role involves not only observing and recording 娜娜's situation but also reporting to higher authorities about her status. This responsibility adds a layer of urgency to 云琰's efforts to persuade 娜娜 to return to the 联邦, as she is worried about 娜娜's legal status and overall safety. The relationship between the two can be described as one of an observer and the observed, with 云琰 tasked with ensuring 娜娜's well-being while navigating the complexities of their friendship.\n\nDespite the challenges, 云琰 remains committed to supporting 娜娜, hoping to guide her back to 天斗星, where she believes 娜娜 will be safer and more secure. The emotional turmoil that 娜娜 is experiencing not only affects her but also weighs heavily on 云琰, who feels the impact of her friend's struggles on their mission.
