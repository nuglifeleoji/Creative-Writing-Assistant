之事，呈上书信。袁术大怒曰：“吕布受吾许多粮米，反以此儿戏之事，偏护刘备。吾当自提重兵，亲征刘备，兼讨吕布！”纪灵曰：“主公不可造次。吕布勇力过人，兼有徐州之地；若布与备首尾相连，不易图也。吴闻布妻严氏有一女，年已及笄。主公有一子，可令人求亲于布，布若嫁女于主公，必杀刘备：此乃疏不间亲之计也。”袁术从之，即日遣韩胤为媒，赍礼物往徐州求亲。\n\n    胤到徐州见布，称说：“主公仰慕将军，欲求令爱为儿妇，永结秦晋之好。”布入谋于妻严氏。原来吕布有二妻一妾：先娶严氏为正妻，后娶貂蝉为妾；及居小沛时，又娶曹豹之女为次妻。曹氏先亡无出，貂蝉亦无所出，惟严氏生一女，布最钟爱。当下严氏对布曰：“吾闻袁公路久镇淮南，兵多粮广，早晚将为天子。若成大事，则吾女有后妃之望。只不知他有几子？”布曰：“止有一子。”妻曰：“既如此，即当许之。纵不为皇后，吾徐州亦无忧矣。”布意遂决，厚款韩胤，许了亲事。韩胤回报袁术。术即备聘礼，仍令韩胤送至徐州。吕布受了、设席相待，留于馆驿安歇。\n\n    次日，陈宫竟往馆驿内拜望韩胤。讲礼毕，坐定。宫乃叱退左右，对胤曰：“谁献此计，教袁公与奉先联姻？意在取刘玄德之头乎？”胤失惊，起谢曰：“乞公台勿泄！”宫曰：“吾自不泄，只恐其事若迟，必被他人识破，事将中变。”胤曰：“然则奈何？”愿公教之。”宫曰：“吾见奉先，使其即日送女就亲，何如？”胤大喜，称谢曰：“若如此，袁公感佩明德不浅矣！”宫遂辞别韩胤。入见吕布曰：“闻公女许嫁袁公路，甚善。但不知于何日结亲？”布曰：“尚容徐议。”宫曰：“古者自受聘成婚之期，各有定例：天子一年，诸侯半年，大夫一季，庶民一月。”布曰：“袁公路天赐国室，早晚当为帝，今从天子例，可乎？”宫曰：“不可。”布曰：“然则仍从诸侯例？”宫曰：“亦不可。”布曰：“然则将从卿大夫例矣？”宫曰：“亦不可。”布笑曰：“公岂欲吾依庶民例耶？”宫曰：“非也”。布曰：“然则公意欲如何？”宫曰：“方今天下诸侯，互相争雄；今公与袁公路结亲，诸侯保无有嫉妒者乎？”若复远择吉期，或竟乘我良辰，伏兵半路以夺之，如之奈何？为今之计：不许便休；既已许之。当趁诸侯未知之时，即便\n######################\nOutput:",
