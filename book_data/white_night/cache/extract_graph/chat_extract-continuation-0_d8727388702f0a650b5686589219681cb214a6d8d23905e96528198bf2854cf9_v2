�。”南澄虽然不是主战斗的魂师，但毕竟也是六环层次的修为，身体素质要比普通人强得多。第一下没抓住还有情可原，第二次没抓住就让她有些惊讶了。\n\n    转过身，明显加快了速度，而且还晃动了一下肩膀，声东击西的向蓝轩宇扑去。\n\n    蓝轩宇脚下一错，在快要被她抓住前的瞬间，身体一个巧妙的旋转，刚好从南澄反关节的方向滑了出去，让她这一抓又落在了空处。\n\n    “哈哈，没抓到。抓不到我，就让我亲你一口哦，妈妈。”连续三次闪开母亲的“抓捕”，蓝轩宇得意极了。\n\n    南澄没有再继续，而是惊讶的看着儿子，虽然她不知道蓝轩宇是如何做到的，但那显然不是简单的闪避，而是有着一些特殊韵律的。\n\n    “轩宇，你这闪避的方法是跟谁学的？”\n\n    “跟娜娜老师呀！”蓝轩宇理所当然的说道，“您不是说让我把学的都告诉您吗？”\n\n    “跟娜娜老师学的？什么时候？我怎么不知道？”南澄顿时惊了。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“在梦里学的。哦，不，娜娜老师说，是在意识之中。”\n\n    南澄大吃一惊，赶忙询问，蓝轩宇这才把一路回程，自己在冥想时娜娜教导他步法的事情讲了一遍。\n\n    听了他的描述，南澄心中震撼可想而知。\n\n    能够入侵他人的精神世界，还不伤害到对方，并且能够教导，这要何等强大的精神力才能做到啊？恐怕灵海境都不行吧？很可能是更高层次的存在。那可是她可望不可及的境界了。\n\n    这位娜娜冕下的实力，真的是太强大了。\n\n    南澄自从进入六阶之后，无论怎么修炼，魂力提升都可以用龟速来形容，她知道，自己的天赋可能就到这里了。但她毕竟是魂帝，对于魂师的见识还是有的。\n\n    “轩宇，我们可以开始学习了吗？”门外传来娜娜悦耳的声音。\n\n    南澄走过去打开门，再看到那绝色容颜时，不自觉的，心中莫名产生出几分敬畏。她现在已经完全可以肯定，娜娜对蓝轩宇是绝对没有恶意的，否则以这位的实力，想要对他们一家如何，实在是再简单不过了。\n\n    要知道，封号斗罗层次强者是有很大豁免权的，就像是古时候的贵族，只要不是什么十恶不赦的大罪，一般来说，联邦对他们的约束都会很小。\n\n    “冕下。”南澄有些恭敬的向娜娜微微躬身。\n\n    娜娜道：“不用担心，我会好好教他的。你也来旁听吧。你的武魂是冰，有借鉴的地方。”\n\n    南澄赶忙点点头，她虽然对实力没那么�\n######################\nOutput:",
