一分钟的时间，很快就要到了。而接下来，就是他们将目标天文数字的联邦货币劫掠一空。而最可怕的是，叶锋完全不知道接下来这些疯狂的家伙会不会依旧引爆整个大厦啊！这才是他最担心的事情。\n\n    这里有上万条生命。大爆炸固然未必能够要自己的命，可是，上万人的惨死，这个责任没有人承担得起。\n\n    无疑，情报部门失误了，可作为这次行动的指挥官，他也责无旁贷。更重要的是，这所有的责任都不算什么，关键是那是成千上万的生命啊！\n\n    叶锋有生以来第一次感觉到自己是如此的无力。无论他自身实力多么强大，现在却是什么都做不了。\n\n    詹京摇头晃脑的在那里等待着，从一开始，他就知道己方一定会成功。联邦情报部门之中本就有他们的人，更何况，这天际大厦最核心的安保主管也是他们的人。不然的话，那么多炸弹是怎么带进来的？\n\n    所有的准备早在两年前，天际大厦刚刚开始建造的时候就已经开始了。他们的目标本就是天际大厦背后的那个家族。\n\n    罪恶之城的犯罪行动一向是雷霆万钧，不动则已，一旦发动，那必然是顷刻之间席卷完毕。\n\n    这次整个行动过程其实也不过就半个小时的时间。可他们调动的资源也是非常庞大的。想要隔绝天际大厦的所有信号，侵入军方信号，再加上屏蔽卫星。这又谈何容易。可他们就是做好了一切准备，和所收获的天文数字金钱相比，付出的这些自然就不算什么了。\n\n    至于会否引爆天际大厦？答案当然是否定的。罪恶之城是疯狂，可也不至于为了一时之快彻底的惹怒联邦。联邦可是有些特别恐怖存在的，万一把那些人惹出来，罪恶之城也承受不住。\n\n    可炸弹却是真实的，因为拆弹、排查总需要时间。这个要比追击他们甚至更重要。\n\n    詹京此时心中充满了满足感。事实上，身为一名精神控制大师，他对钱根本没什么概念，他喜欢的是那个过程，是那个一切尽在掌控的过程。那种成就感是任何其他东西所无法比拟的。\n\n    “滴……”传输完成。\n\n    一个小小的模块也随之从主脑中退出，被詹京捏在手中。\n\n    ……\n------------\n\n第五十四章 别怕\n\n
