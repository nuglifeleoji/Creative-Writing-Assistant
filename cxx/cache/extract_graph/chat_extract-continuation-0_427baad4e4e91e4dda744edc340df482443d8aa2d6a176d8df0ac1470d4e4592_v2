事实。特别是本世纪以来，他们掌握了核裂变和核聚变的巨大能量，虽然这只是爱因斯坦和费米这类盗火者从恒星的大火中偷来的一粒小小的火星，但人们自以为他们已掌握了征服宇宙的力量。没有人知道，死星的能量正以光速日夜兼程地扑向这个小小的蓝色行星。\n　　死星的强光越过了人马座三星后，又在冷寂的而广漠的外太空走了四年，终于到达了太阳系的外围。（这时，那两个中国孩子乘坐的火车刚刚启程。）在那只有不带慧尾的慧星游荡的空间中，死星的能量同人类进行了第一次间接的接触。在那距地球十亿公里的远方，有一个人造的物体在向银河系的星海孤独地跋涉着，这就是七十年代从地球启程的“旅行者”号星际探测器。它象一把形状奇怪的伞，伞面是对准地球的抛物面天线。探测器上带着一块人类的名片，那是一块画有两个裸体人类的铅合金板，还有一张唱片，上面录有联合国秘书长对外星文明的问候，还录有地球大海的涛声，小鸟的鸣叫和中国古曲《流水》等。这个人类向银河系派出的使者首先领略了宇宙的严酷，在它进入死星光海后，立刻变成了一堆炽热的金属，伞状天线因温度从接近绝对零度的低温突然升高而变形扭曲，检测高能射线的盖革计数仪因射线强度过大而呈饱和状态，读数反而为零；只有紫外光探测器，射线探测器和磁场仪正常地工作了两秒钟，在集成电路被高能射线摧毁之前，\"旅行者\"号上的计算机向地球发回了一串令它的制造者难以置信的观测数据。由于发射天线的损坏，设在内华达和澳大利亚的高灵敏度天线阵列永远也不会收到这串数据，但这已无关紧要，人类很快可以亲自测量他们无法相信的一切了。\n　　死星的强光越过了太阳系的边界——冥王星，在它那固态氮的蓝色晶体大地上激起一片蒸气；很快，强光又越过了天王星和海王星，使它们的星环变得晶莹透明；越过了土星和木星，高能粒子的狂风在它们的液体表面掀起一阵磷光；死星的能量又以光速飞行了一个半小时，到达月球，哥白尼环形山和雨海平原发出一片剌目的白光，死星的光芒也照亮了雨海平原上的一排人类脚印，那是阿姆斯特朗和奥尔德林在30年前留下的，当时不远处的蓝色行星上有上亿人在电视中看着他们，所有的人在那一激动人心的时刻都认为宇宙是为他们而存在的。\n　　又过了一秒钟，在太空中行走了八年的死星的光芒到达地球。
