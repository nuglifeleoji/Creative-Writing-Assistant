It is a river crossed by the **Royal Road**, near which a confrontation with the **Museum Fremen** occurs, and is also part of a journey's route, traversed via a **faery bridge**. The river flows near **Onn** and shares its name with **Duncan Idaho**, linking it to the broader lore of the setting.  \n\nFlowing **southward beyond the Sareer's boundary wall**, the Idaho River is described as visible in the moonlight and audible through the ground, suggesting a mystical or heightened sensory presence. It also serves as a **sanctuary**, symbolizing safety from the **D-wolves**, as evidenced by **Kwuteg's** hope to reach it. Additionally, **Siona** crosses the river to escape a wolf pack, marking the boundary of the **Forbidden Forest**, further emphasizing its role as a transitional or protective space.  \n\nThe river is noted as a landmark near where **Lord Leto's entourage** travels, reinforcing its importance in the narrative's geography. Some descriptions characterize it as a **man-made waterway** flowing through a canyon, symbolizing the planet's transformation under **Leto's rule**. However, another account describes it as a **vanished feature on Rakis**, where **Leto II met his fate**, suggesting a historical or post-historical perspective.  \n\nWhile some details may appear contradictory—such as its man-made nature versus its natural or vanished state—these can be reconciled by interpreting the Idaho River as a feature that evolved or was altered over time, reflecting the shifting landscapes and regimes of its world. Its multifaceted roles—as a boundary, sanctuary, symbol, and historical landmark—underscore its enduring significance across different epochs and narratives.  \n\nIn summary, the **Idaho River** is a dynamic and richly symbolic entity, embodying themes of transition, safety, and transformation, while serving as a critical geographical marker in the stories it inhabits.\",6\r\n767,SARER,\"**SARER** is a vast, barren desert region on Arrakis, serving as the last remnant of the planet's once-dominant arid landscape. It lies near the God Emperor Leto II's Citadel fortress, functioning as both his sanctuary and a place of profound significance, tied to past memories and transformative encounters. The Sareer is characterized by extreme heat, mirages, and a distinct, fluid horizon, creating an environment of desolation and harsh beauty.  \n\nHigh cliffs and towering walls, constructed from material taken from a former mountain named after Idaho, encircle the region, marking its boundaries and reinforcing its isolation. The Sareer is a controlled environment where cool air is drawn into the Citadel, and its edges experience rare, satellite-regulated rainfall during the warm season. This starkly contrasts with the lush landscapes observed elsewhere on Arrakis, emphasizing its role as a testing ground for those like Siona, who undergo trials under Leto's rule.  \n\nThe region is also associated with the charts studied by Idaho and Leto, further underscoring its strategic and symbolic importance. Despite its inhospitable nature, the Sareer is a safe zone under Leto's dominion, home to settlements like Tabur Village. It remains a place of myth and memory—a final desert sanctuary bordered by man-made barriers and the Idaho River, preserving the legacy of Dune's past while shaping its future.\",8\r\n897,TABUR VILLAGE,\"**Tabur Village** is a water-rich settlement located near the boundary wall of the Sareer region, inhabited by Museum Fremen who cultivate plants and date palms. Initially, it was planned as the location for Leto's wedding ceremony, but the venue was later changed to Tuono Village. Despite this change, earlier descriptions indicate that Tabur Village was once the intended site for the event in the Sareer. The village's fertile environment and proximity to the Sareer's boundary wall make it a notable location, though its role in the wedding plans was ultimately revised.  \n\nThe conflicting descriptions about the wedding's location are resolved by clarifying that while Tabur Village was originally selected, the final decision shifted to Tuono Village. This adjustment does not diminish Tabur Village's significance as a thriving agricultural community tended by the Museum Fremen. The village remains an important part of the Sareer's landscape, even if it no longer serves as the wedding venue.\",4\r\n902,TOWER,\"Leto's tower is his residence and observation point, featuring an aerie and a balcony with a view of the surrounding land.\"\"\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1648,SIONA,IDAHO RIVER,Siona crosses the Idaho River to escape the wolf pack.,54\r\n1986,SARER,IDAHO RIVER,\"The Sareer is bordered by the Idaho River, which flows beyond its boundary wall\",14\r\n1970,TABUR VILLAGE,SARER,Tabur Village is located within the Sareer region.,12\r\n1985,TOWER,SARER,\"The tower overlooks the Sareer, the last desert sanctuary on Dune\",10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
