Central to this project is the resurrection of **Duncan Idaho**, a key historical figure, whose ghola form is tied to the Bene Gesserit's political and economic power struggles. The project involves not only the awakening of these gholas but also their training and protection, with notable figures such as **Miles Teg** and **Lucilla** tasked with safeguarding and guiding them.  \n\nThe project's objectives appear multifaceted: it serves as a means to resurrect influential figures from the past, potentially for strategic or ideological purposes, while also playing a role in the Bene Gesserit's broader, long-term plans. Duncan Idaho's ghola, in particular, is emphasized as a critical component, suggesting his unique importance to the sisterhood. However, the project has encountered complications, including the reported disappearance of the ghola alongside Teg and Lucilla, indicating potential instability or external interference.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing the resurrection of Duncan Idaho specifically, others referencing gholas more generally—the overarching theme remains consistent: the **GHOLA PROJECT** is a high-stakes endeavor by the Bene Gesserit to harness the power of gholas, with Duncan Idaho's resurrection serving as a focal point. The project underscores the Bene Gesserit's manipulation of genetic memory, political influence, and clandestine operations to further their goals.\",7\n1892,GHOLA-TEG,\"**GHOLA-TEG** is a cloned recreation of the renowned military commander Miles Teg, engineered to preserve his unique abilities and knowledge. This ghola, currently in a childlike state, is undergoing preparation for memory restoration to reclaim the skills and experiences of the original Miles Teg. Notably, GHOLA-TEG is recognized for inheriting prescient abilities, a trait associated with the Bene Gesserit breeding program and the original Teg's extraordinary talents. The cloning process ensures the preservation of these capabilities, positioning GHOLA-TEG as a pivotal figure in future events. While still young, the ghola's development is carefully managed to facilitate the eventual awakening of its full potential, blending the legacy of Miles Teg with new possibilities.\",2\n1547,MILES TEG,\"**Miles Teg** is a complex and multifaceted figure in Bene Gesserit history, embodying roles as a military leader, Mentat, ghola, and key strategist. A ghola clone of the original Bashar Miles Teg, he was raised by the Bene Gesserit, displaying exceptional intelligence, memory, and latent Mentat abilities. He is the son of Janet and Loschy Teg, with Atreides ancestry, and the father of Odrade, whose memories and last words hold significance for the Sisterhood.  \n\nTeg serves as a retired Bashar and Military Mentat, often recalled for critical missions. He is a trusted weapons master and guardian tasked with protecting and training the ghola Duncan Idaho, employing brutal methods to reawaken Duncan's memories. His strategic brilliance and unexpected tactics earn him the nickname \"\"Old Reliability,\"\" drawing comparisons to Duke Leto Atreides. Teg mentors Duncan and Burzmali, shaping their military acumen with his deep understanding of human nature and improvisational combat skills.  \n\nHis relationship with the Bene Gesserit is nuanced; while loyal, he occasionally challenges their doctrines, forcing revisions to historical records. As a philosopher and commander, he balances opposing forces, reflecting on strategy and honor. Teg leads pivotal battles, such as the defense of Junction against the Honored Matres, and oversees fugitive operations with tactical precision.  \n\nAt times, Teg appears as a young boy—either as a ghola in early training or in flashbacks to his childhood, where his mother’s influence is evident. His legacy spans generations, from his role in the ghola project to his posthumous recreation in *Chapterhouse: Dune*.

Despite her familial ties to Teg, Dimela harbors reservations about her father's alignment with Bene Gesserit practices, suggesting a degree of ideological tension within their relationship. Additionally, she has drawn the attention of the Bene Gesserit, likely due to her genetic lineage, which may make her a candidate for their breeding programs. This combination of personal skepticism, familial responsibility, and strategic interest from the Bene Gesserit paints Dimela as a complex figure navigating competing loyalties and pressures.  \n\nHer role as both a caretaker of the estate and a person of interest to the Bene Gesserit highlights her dual significance—pragmatic in her daily responsibilities yet entangled in the broader political and genetic machinations of her universe.
