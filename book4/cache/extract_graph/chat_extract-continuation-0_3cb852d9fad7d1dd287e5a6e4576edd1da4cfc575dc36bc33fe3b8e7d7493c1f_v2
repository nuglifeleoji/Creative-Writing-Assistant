\n　　因为还有七八天时间，田福军很快插空到黄原周围几个县转了一圈。从某种意义上说，这带有告别的性质。直到临近动身去北京的前一天，他才返回黄原。 \n　　当天晚上，他正在办公室整理文件，地区公安处一位副处长突然进了门。这是原西籍干部，也是他的老熟人。 \n　　田福军以为哪里发生了恶性案件，便紧张地等待这位副处长向他汇报案情。 \n　　副处长阎生华不是来汇报什么恶性案件的，他是来报喜的。他告诉地委书记：黄原地区公安处，已经被省上评为全省精神文明的先进集体了！ \n　　“这很好。地区公安处这几年确实做了许多工作。”田福军鼓励说。 \n　　“咱们地区的刑事案件，这几年一直保持全省最低程度！”生华有点自满地说。他接着还举了个例子：某偏僻村庄的村民外出赶集走亲戚从来不锁门，只挂上门关子，以防猎狗钻进去就行了；下地劳动，工具也不往家里拿，就在地里搁着；可多少年来，全村没有发生一次失盗事件……“这有点远古文明的味道。”田福军微笑着说。“你还有什么具体事？”阎生华一本正经坐在他对面，说：“既然咱们成了精神文明的先进集体，就应该好上加好，多做一些工作，我有个想法，不知……”阎生华迟疑地望了一眼田福军。“你说！”田福军有点烦。这位副处长如果要谈他的工作，本来应该去找分管政法的副书记。 \n　　阎生华见书记有耐心，就赶忙谈起了他自己有关精神文明的“想法”。他说：“近来，外面的坏风气传到黄原不少。比如，现在街上留长头发的青年越来越多，流里流气的，许多老同志都看不惯。我在处里是分管治安的，因此，我想派些人到街上去，劝说这些青年把头发剪短一些。咱们也不强迫！只是作说服工作……” \n　　田福军惊讶地张开嘴巴，将这位副处长看了大半天，才说：“你再没个干的了？管这些事干啥嘛！头发长短和你公安处有何关系？精神文明不文明，其标志就是头发长短吗？老弟呀，现在都是我们这些短头发的人掌权；要是有一天留长头发的人掌了权，说我们这些留短头发的人不文明，不留长发不准许我们上街，我们该怎么办？人家留长头发，我们好办，拿剪子一剪就行了，可到时我们的短头发要往长留，那可是得一些日子罗！” \n　　田福军挪揄生华的话，倒先把自己逗的仰头笑起来。阎生华大概也意识到他已把精神文明搞得有点庸俗了，便红着脸尴尬地起身告退。 \n　　阎生华走后，田福军想笑，又笑不出来，反而陷入了长久的深思之中。是�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
