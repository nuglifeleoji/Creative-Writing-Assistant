His own daughter!”\n“In his day, Moneo too was a rebel.”\n“See what | mean? Did you test him, too?”\n“Yes.”\n“Will you test me?”\n“I am testing you.”\nIdaho glared at him, then: “I don’t understand your government, your Empire, anything. The more | find out, the more | realize that | don’t know what’s going on.”\n“How fortunate that you have discovered the way of wisdom,” Leto said.\n“What?” Idaho’s baffled outrage raised his voice to a battlefield roar which filled the small room.\nLeto smiled. “Duncan, have | not told you that when you think you know something, that is a most perfect barrier against learning?”\n“Then tell me what’s going on.”\n“My friend Duncan Idaho is acquiring a new habit. He is learning always to look beyond what he thinks he knows.”\n“All right, all right.” Idaho nodded his head slowly in time to the words. “Then what’s beyond letting me take part in that Siaynog thing?”\n“lam binding the Fish Speakers to the Commander of my Guard.”\n“And | have to fight them off! The escort that took me out to the Citadel wanted to stop for an orgy. And the ones who\nbrought me back here when you...”\n“They know how much it pleases me to see children of Duncan Idaho.”\n“Damn you! I’m not your stud!”\n“No need to shout, Duncan.”\nIdaho took several deep breaths, then: “When | tell them ‘no,’ they act hurt at first and then they treat me like some damned”—he shook his head—“holy man or something.”\n“Don’t they obey you?”\n“They don’t question anything . .. unless it’s contrary to your orders. | didn’t want to come back here.”\n“Yet they brought you.”\n“You know damned well they won’t disobey you!”\n“I’m glad you came, Duncan.”\n“Oh, | can see that!”\n“The Fish Speakers know how special you are, how fond | am of you, how much | owe you. It’s never a question of obedience and disobedience where you and | are concerned.”\n“Then what is it a question of?”\n“Loyalty.”\nIdaho fell into pensive silence.\n“You felt the power of Siaynog?” Leto asked.\n“Mumbo jumbo.”\n“Then why are you disturbed by it?”\n“Your Fish Speakers aren’t an army, they’re a police force.”\n“By my name, | assure you that’s not so. Police are inevitably corrupted.”\n“You tempted me with power,” Idaho accused.\n“That’s the test, Duncan.”\n“You don’t trust me?”\n“I trust your loyalty to the Atreides implicitly, without question.”\n“Then what’s this talk of corruption and testing?”\n“You were the one who accused me of having a police force. Police always observe that criminals prosper. It takes a pretty dull policeman to miss the fact that the position of authority is the most prosperous criminal position available.”\nIdaho wet his lips with his tongue and stared at Leto with obvious puzzlement. “But the moral training of ... I mean, the legal...the prisons to...”\n“What good are laws and prisons when the breaking of a law is not a sin?”\nIdaho cocked his head slightly to the right. “Are you trying to tell me that your damned religion is...”\n“Punishment of sins can be quite extravagant.”\nIdaho hooked a thumb over his shoulder toward the world outside the door. “All this talk about death penalties .. . that flogging and...”\n“I try to dispense with casual laws and prisons wherever possible.”\n“You have to have some prisons!”\n“Do I? Prisons are needed only to provide the illusion that courts and police are effective. They’re a kind of job insurance.”\nIdaho turned slightly and thrust a pointing finger toward the door through which he had entered the small room. “You’ve got whole planets that are nothing but prisons!”\n“I guess you could think of anywhere as a prison if that’s the way your illusions go.”\n“Illusions!” Idaho dropped his hand to his side and stood dumbfounded.\n“Yes. You talk of prisons and police and legalities, the perfect illusions behind which a prosperous power structure can operate while observing, quite accurately, that it is above its own laws.”\n“And you think crimes can be dealt with by...”\n“Not crimes, Duncan, sins.”\n“So you think your religion can...”\n“Have you noted the primary sins?”\n“What?”\n“Attempting to corrupt a member of my government, and corruption by a member of my government.”\n“And what is this corruption?”\n“Essentially, it’s the failure to observe and worship the holiness of the God Leto.”\n“You?”\n“Me.”\n“But you told me right at the beginning that...”\n“You think I don’t believe in my own godhead? Be careful, Duncan.”\nIdaho’s voice came with angry flatness. “You told me that one of my jobs was to help keep your secret, that you...”\n“You don’t know my secret.”\n“That you’re a tyrant? That’s no...”\n“Gods have more power than tyrants, Duncan.”\n“I don’t like what I’m hearing.”\n“When has an Atreides ever asked you to //ke your job?”\n“You ask me to command your Fish Speakers who are judge, jury and executioner...” Idaho broke off.\n“And what?”\nIdaho remained silent.\nLeto stared across the chill distance between them, so short a space yet so far.\nIt’s like playing a fish on a line, Leto thought. You must calculate the breaking point of every element in the contest.\nThe problem with Idaho was that bringing him to the net always hastened his end. And it was happening too rapidly this time. Leto felt sadness.\n“I won’t worship you,” Idaho said.\n“The Fish Speakers recognize that you have a special dispensation,” Leto said.\n“Like Moneo and Siona?”\n“Much different.”\n“So rebels are a special case.”\nLeto grinned. “All of my most trusted administrators were rebels at one time.”\n“|wasn’'ta...”\n“You were a brilliant rebel! You helped the Atreides wrest an Empire from a reigning monarch.”\nIdaho’s eyes went out of focus with introspection. “So | did.” He shook his head sharply as though tossing something out of his hair. “And look what you’ve done with that Empire!”\n“I have set up a pattern in it, a pattern of patterns.”\n“So you Say.”\n“Information is frozen in patterns, Duncan. We can use one pattern to solve another pattern. Flow patterns are the hardest to recognize and understand.”\n“More mumbo jumbo.”\n“You made that mistake once before.”\n“Why do you let the Tleilaxu keep bringing me back to life —one ghola after another? Where’s the pattern in that?”\n“Because of the qualities which you possess in abundance. | will let my father say it.”\nIdaho’s mouth drew into a grim line.\nLeto spoke in Muad’Dib’s voice, and even the cowled face fell into a semblance of the paternal features. “You were my truest friend, Duncan, better even than Gurney Halleck. But | am the past.”\nIdaho swallowed hard. “The things you’re doing!”\n“They cut against the Atreides grain?”\n“You're damned right!”\nLeto resumed his ordinary tones. “Yet I’m still Atreides.”\n“Are you really?”\n“What else could | be?”\n“I wish | knew!”\n“You think | play tricks with words and voices?”\n“What in all the seven hells are you really doing?”\n“| preserve life while setting the stage for the next cycle.”\n“You preserve it by killing?”\n“Death has often been useful to life.”\n“That’s not Atreides!”\n“But it is. We often saw the value of death. The Ixians, however, have never seen that value.”\n“What’ve the Ixians got to do with...”\n“Everything. They would make a machine to conceal their other machinations.”\nIdaho spoke in a musing tone. “Is that why the Ixian Ambassador was here?”\n“You've seen Hwi Noree,” Leto said.\nIdaho pointed upward. “She was leaving as | arrived.”\n“You spoke to her?”\n“I asked her what she was doing here. She said she was choosing sides.”\nA burst of laughter erupted from Leto. “Oh, my,” he said. “She is so good. Did she reveal her choice?”\n“She said she serves the God Emperor now. | didn’t believe her, of course.”\n“But you should believe her.”\n“Why?”\n“Ahhh, yes; | forgot that you once doubted even my grandmother, the Lady Jessica.”\n“| had good reason!”\n“Do you also doubt Siona?”\n“I’m beginning to doubt everyone!”\n“And you say you don’t know your value to me,” Leto accused.\n“What about Siona?” Idaho demanded. “She says you want us... | mean, dammit...”\n“The thing you must always trust about Siona is her creativity. She can create the new and beautiful. One always trusts the truly creative.”\n“Even the machinations of the Ixians?”\n“That is not creative. You always know the creative because it is revealed openly. Concealment betrays the existence of another force entirely.”\n“Then you don’t trust this Hwi Noree, but you...”\n“| do trust her, and precisely for the reasons | have just given you.”\nIdaho scowled, then relaxed and sighed. “I had better cultivate her acquaintance. If she is someone you...”\n“No! You will stay away from Hwi Noree. | have something special in mind for her.”\n| have isolated the city-experience within me and have examined it closely. The idea of a city fascinates me. The formation of a biological community without a functioning, supportive social community leads to havoc. Whole worlds have become single biological communities without an interrelated social structure and this has always led to ruin. It becomes dramatically instructive under overcrowded conditions. The ghetto is lethal. Psychic stresses of overcrowding create pressures which will erupt. The city is an attempt to manage these forces. The social forms by which cities make the attempt are worth study. Remember that there exists a certain malevolence about the formation of any social order. It is the struggle for existence by an artificial entity. Despotism and slavery hover at the edges. Many injuries occur and, thus, the need for laws. The law develops its own power structure, creating more wounds and new injustices. Such trauma can be healed by cooperation, not by confrontation. The summons to cooperate identifies the healer.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nMI oneo entered Leto’s small chamber with evident agitation. He actually preferred this meeting place because the God Emperor’s cart lay in a depression from which a deadly attack by the Worm would be more difficult, and there was the undeniable fact that Leto allowed his majordomo to descend in an Ixian tube-lift rather than via that interminable ramp. But Moneo felt that the news he brought this morning was guaranteed to arouse The Worm Who Is God.\nHow to present it?\nDawn lay only an hour past, the fourth Festival Day, a fact Moneo could greet with equanimity only because it brought him that much nearer the end of these tribulations.\nLeto stirred as Moneo entered the small chamber. Illumination came on at his signal, focusing only on his face.\n“Good morning, Moneo,” he said. “My guard tells me you insisted on entering immediately. Why?”\nThe danger, Moneo knew from experience, lay in the temptation to reveal too much too soon.\n“I have", " this meeting place because the God Emperor’s cart lay in a depression from which a deadly attack by the Worm would be more difficult, and there was the undeniable fact that Leto allowed his majordomo to descend in an Ixian tube-lift rather than via that interminable ramp.

Illumination came on at his signal, focusing only on his face.\n“Good morning, Moneo,” he said. “My guard tells me you insisted on entering immediately. Why?”\nThe danger, Moneo knew from experience, lay in the temptation to reveal too much too soon.\n“I have spent some time with the Reverend Mother Anteac,” he said. “Although she keeps it well hidden, I’m sure she is a Mentat.”\n“Yes. The Bene Gesserit were bound to disobey me sometime. This form of disobedience amuses me.”\n“Then you will not punish them?”\n“Moneo, | am ultimately the only parent my people have. A parent must be generous as well as severe.”\nHe’s in a good mood, Moneo thought. A small sigh escaped Moneo, at which Leto smiled.\n“Anteac objected when | told her you had ordered an amnesty for a selected few Face Dancers among our Captives.”\n“I have a Festive use for them,” Leto said.\n“Lord?”\n“ĮI will tell you later. Let’s get to the news which brings you bursting in upon me at this hour.”\n“I... ahhh...” Moneo chewed at his upper lip. “The Tleilaxu have been quite garrulous in the attempt to ingratiate themselves with me.”\n“Of course they have. And what have they revealed?”\n“They ... ahhh, provided the Ixians with sufficient advice\nand equipment to make a... uhhh, not exactly a ghola, and not even a clone. Perhaps we should use the Tleilaxu term: a cellular restructuring. The... ahhh, experiment was\nconducted within some sort of shielding device which the Guildsmen assured them your powers could not penetrate.”\n“And the result?” Leto felt that he was asking the question in a cold vacuum.\n“They are not certain. Tleilaxu were not permitted to witness. However, they did observe that Malky entered this... ahhh, chamber and that he emerged later with an infant.”\n“Yes! | know!”\n“You do?” Moneo was puzzled.\n“By inference. And all of this happened some twenty-six years ago?”\n“That is correct, Lord.”\n“They identify the infant as Hwi Noree?”\n“They are not certain, Lord, but...” Moneo shrugged.\n“Of course. And what do you deduce from this, Moneo?”\n“There is a deep purpose built into the new Ixian Ambassador.”\n“Certainly there is. Moneo, has it not struck you as odd how much Hwi, the gentle Hwi, represents a mirror of the redoubtable Malky? His opposite in everything, including sex.”\n“I had not thought of that, Lord.”\n“I have.”\n“I will have her sent back to Ix immediately,” Moneo said.\n“You will do nothing of the kind!”\n“But, Lord, if they...”\n“Moneo, | have observed that you seldom turn your back on danger. Others often do, but you—seldom. Why would you have me engage in such an obvious stupidity?”\nMoneo swallowed.\n“Good. | like it when you recognize the error of your ways,” Leto said.\n“Thank you, Lord.”\n“Il also like it when you express your gratitude sincerely, as you have just done. Now, Anteac was with you when you heard these revelations?”\n“As you ordered, Lord.”\n“Excellent. That will stir things up a bit. You will leave now and go to the Lady Hwi. You will tell her that | desire to see her immediately. This will disturb her. She is thinking that we will not meet again until | summon her to the Citadel. | want you to quiet her fears.”\n“In what way, Lord?”\nLeto spoke sadly: “Moneo, why do you ask advice on something at which you are an expert? Calm her and bring her here reassured of my kindly intentions toward her.”\n“Yes, Lord.” Moneo bowed and backed away a step.\n“One moment, Moneo!”\nMoneo stiffened, his gaze fixed on Leto’s face.\n“You are puzzled, Moneo,” Leto said. “Sometimes you do not know what to think of me. Am | all-powerful and all- prescient? You bring me these little dibs and dabs and you wonder: Does he already know this? If he does, why do I bother? But | have ordered you to report such things, Moneo. Is your obedience not instructive?”\nMoneo started to shrug and thought better of it. His lips trembled.\n“Time can also be a place, Moneo,” Leto said. “Everything depends upon where you are standing, on where you look or what you hear. The measure of it is found in consciousness itself.”\nAfter a long silence, Moneo ventured: “Is that all, Lord?”\n“No, itis not all. Siona will receive today a package delivered to her by a Guild courier. Nothing is to interfere with delivery of that package. Do you understand?”\n“What is... what is in the package, Lord?”\n“Some translations, reading matter which | wish her to see. You will do nothing to interfere. There is no melange in the package.”\n“How ... how did you know what | feared was in the...” “Because you fear the spice. It could extend your life, but you avoid it.”\n“| fear its other effects, Lord.”\n“A bountiful nature has decreed that melange will unveil for some of us unexpected depths of the psyche, yet you fear this?”\n“lam Atreides, Lord!”\n“Ahhh, yes, and for the Atreides, melange may roll the mystery of Time through a peculiar process of internal\nrevelation.”\n“I have only to remember the way you tested me, Lord.”\n“Do you not see the necessity for you to sense the Golden Path?”\n“That is not what | fear, Lord.”\n“You fear the other astonishment, the thing which made me make my choice.”\n“I have only to look at you, Lord, and know that fear. We Atreides . . .” He broke off, his mouth dry.\n“You do not want all of these memories of ancestors and the others who flock within me!”\n“Sometimes... Sometimes, Lord, | think the spice is the Atreides curse!”\n“Do you wish that / had never occurred?”\nMoneo remained silent.\n“But melange has its values, Moneo. The Guild navigators need it. And without it, the Bene Gesserit would degenerate into a helpless band of whining females!”\n“We must live with it or without it, Lord. | know that.”\n“Very perceptive, Moneo. But you choose to live without it.”\n“Do | not have that choice, Lord?”\n“For now.”\n“Lord, what do you...”\n“There are twenty-eight different words for melange in common Galach. They describe it by its intended use, by its dilution, by its age, by whether it came through honest purchase, through theft or conquest, whether it was the dower gift for a male or for a female, and in many other ways is it named. What do you make of this, Moneo?”\n“We are offered many choices, Lord.”\n“Only where the spice is concerned?”\nMoneo’s brow wrinkled in thought, then: “No.”\n“You so seldom say ‘no’ in my presence,” Leto said. “l enjoy watching your lips form around the word.”\nMoneo’s mouth twitched in an attempted smile.\nLeto spoke briskly: “Well! You must go now to the Lady Hwi. | will give you one parting piece of advice which may help.”\nMoneo paid studious attention to Leto’s face.\n“Drug knowledge originated mostly with males because they tend to be more venturesome—an outgrowth of male aggression. You’ve read your Orange Catholic Bible, thus you know the story of Eve and the apple. Here’s an interesting fact about that story: Eve was not the first to pluck and sample the apple. Adam was first and he learned by this to put the blame on Eve. My story tells you something about how our societies find a structural necessity for sub-groups.”\nMoneo tipped his head slightly to the left. “Lord, how does this help me?”\n“It will help you with the Lady Hwi!”\nThe singular multiplicity of this universe draws my deepest attention. It is a thing of ultimate beauty.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nBe heard Moneo in the antechamber just before Hwi entered the small audience room. She wore voluminous pale green pantaloons tightly tied at the ankles with darker green bows to match her sandals. A loose blouse of the same dark green could be seen under her black cloak.\nShe appeared calm as she approached Leto and sat without being invited, choosing a golden cushion rather than the red one she had occupied earlier. It had taken less than an hour for Moneo to bring her. Leto’s acute hearing detected Moneo fidgeting in the anteroom and Leto sent a signal which sealed the arched doorway there.\n“Something has disturbed Moneo,” Hwi said. “He tried very hard not to reveal this to me, but the more he tried to soothe me the more he aroused my curiosity.”\n“He did not frighten you?”\n“Oh, no. He did say something very interesting, though. He said that | must remember it at all times, that the God Leto is a different person to each of us.”\n“How is this interesting?” Leto asked.\n“The interesting thing is the question for which this was the preface. He said he often wonders what part we play in creating that difference in you.”\n“That /s interesting.”\n“I think it is a truthful insight,” Hwi said. “Why have you summoned me?”\n“At one time, your masters on Ix...”\n“They are no longer my masters, Lord.”\n“Forgive me. | will refer to them hereafter as the Ixians.”\nShe nodded gravely, prompting: “At one time...”\n“The Ixians contemplated making a weapon—a type of hunter-seeker, self-propelled death with a machine mind. It was to be designed as a self-improving thing which would seek out life and reduce that life to its inorganic matter.”\n“I have not heard of this thing, Lord.”\n“I know that. The Ixians do not recognize that machine- makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine. This is ultimate sterility. Machines always fail... given time. And when these machines failed there would be nothing left, no life at all.”\n“Sometimes | think they are mad,” she said.\n“Anteac’s opinion. That is the immediate problem. The Ixians are now engaged in an endeavor which they are concealing.”\n“Even from you?”\n“Even from me. | am sending the Reverend Mother Anteac to investigate for me. To help her, | want you to tell her everything you can about the place where you spent your childhood. Omit no", " making a weapon—a type of hunter-seeker, self-propelled death with a machine mind.

To help her, | want you to tell her everything you can about the place where you spent your childhood. Omit no detail, no matter how small. Anteac will help you remember. We want every sound, every smell, the shapes and names of visitors, the colors and even the tinglings of your skin. The slightest thing may be vital.”\n“You think it is the place of concealment?”\n“I know it is.”\n“And you think they are making this weapon in...”\n“No, but this will be our excuse for investigating the place where you were born.”\nShe opened her mouth and gradually formed a smile, then: “My Lord is devious. | will soeak to the Reverend Mother immediately.” Hwi started to rise, but he stopped her with a gesture.\n“We must not give the appearance of haste,” he said.\nShe sank back onto the cushion.\n“Each of us is different in the way of Moneo’s observation,” he said. “Genesis does not stop. Your god continues creating you.”\n“What will Anteac find? You know, don’t you?”\n“Let us say that | have a strong conviction. Now, you have not once mentioned the subject which | broached earlier. Have you no questions?”\n“You will provide the answers as | require them.” It was a statement full of such trust that it stopped Leto’s voice. He could only look at her, realizing how extraordinary was this accomplishment of the Ixians—this human. Hwi remained precisely true to the dictates of her personally chosen morality. She was comely, warm and honest and possessed of an emphatic sense which forced her to share every anguish in those with whom she identified. He could imagine the dismay of her Bene Gesserit teachers when confronted by this immovable core of self-honesty. The teachers obviously had been reduced to adding a touch here, an ability there, everything strengthening that power which prevented her from becoming a Bene Gesserit. How that must have rankled!\n“Lord,” she said, “I would know the motives which forced you to choose your life.”\n“First, you must understand what it is like to see our future.”\n“With your help, | will try.”\n“Nothing is ever separated from its source,” he said. “Seeing futures is a vision of a continuum in which all things take shape like bubbles forming beneath a waterfall. You see them and then they vanish into the stream. If the stream ends, it is as though the bubbles never were. That stream is my Golden Path and | saw it end.”\n“Your choice”—she gestured at his body—“changed that?”\n“It is changing. The change comes not only from the manner of my life but from the manner of my death.”\n“You know how you will die?”\n“Not how. | know only the Golden Path in which it will occur.”\n“Lord, | donot...”\n“It is difficult to understand, | know. | will die four deaths —the death of the flesh, the death of the soul, the death of the myth and the death of reason. And all of these deaths contain the seed of resurrection.”\n“You will return from...”\n“The seeds will return.”\n“When you are gone, what will happen to your religion?”\n“All religions are a single communion. The spectrum remains unbroken within the Golden Path. It is only that humans see first one part and then another. Delusions can be called accidents of the senses.”\n“People will still worship you,” she said.\n“Yes.”\n“But when forever ends, there will be anger,” she said. “There will be denial. Some will say you were just an ordinary tyrant.”\n“Delusion,” he agreed.\nA lump in her throat prevented her from speaking for a moment, then: “How does your life and your death change the ...” She shook her head.\n“Life will continue.”\n“|I believe that, Lord, but how?”\n“Each cycle is a reaction to the preceding cycle. If you think about the shape of my Empire, then you know the shape of the next cycle.”\nShe looked away from him. “Everything I learned about your Family told me that you would do this”—she gestured blindly in his direction without looking at him—“only with a selfless motive. | do not think I truly know the shape of your Empire, though.”\n“Leto’s Golden Peace?”\n“There is less peace than some would have us believe,” she said, looking back at him.\nThe honesty of her! he thought. Nothing deterred it.\n“This is the time of the stomach,” he said. “This is the time when we expand as a single cell expands.”\n“But something is missing,” she said.\nShe is like the Duncans, he thought. Something is missing and they sense it immediately.\n“The flesh grows, but the psyche does not grow,” he said.\n“The psyche?”\n“That reflexive awareness which tells us how very alive we can become. You know it well, Hwi. It is that sense which tells you how to be true to yourself.”\n“Your religion is not enough,” she said.\n“No religion can ever be enough. It is a matter of choice— a single, lonely choice. Do you understand now why your friendship and your company mean so much to me?”\nShe blinked back tears, nodding, then: “Why don’t people know this?”\n“Because the conditions don’t permit it.”\n“The conditions which you dictate?”\n“Precisely. Look throughout my Empire. Do you see the Shape?”\nShe closed her eyes, thinking.\n“One wishes to sit by a river and fish every day?” he asked. “Excellent. That is this life. You desire to sail a small boat across an island sea and visit strangers? Superb! What else is there to do?”\n“Travel in space?” she asked and there was a defiant note in her voice. She opened her eyes.\n“You have observed that the Guild and | do not allow this.”\n“You do not allow it.”\n“True. If the Guild disobeys me, it gets no spice.”\n“And holding people planetbound keeps them out of mischief.”\n“It does something more important than that. It fills them with a longing to travel. It creates a need to make far voyages and see strange things. Eventually, travel comes to mean freedom.”\n“But the spice dwindles,” she said.\n“And freedom becomes more precious every day.”\n“This can only lead to desperation and violence,” she said.\n“A wise man in my ancestry—I was actually that person, you know? Do you understand that there are no strangers in my past?”\nShe nodded, awed.\n“This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom. But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.”\n“The Guild and the Sisterhood enslave themselves!”\n“And the Ixians and the Tleilaxu and all the others. Oh, they ferret out a bit of hidden melange from time to time and that keeps the attention fixed. A very interesting game, don’t you think?”\n“But when the violence comes .. .”\n“There will be famines and hard thoughts.”\n“Here on Arrakis, too?”\n“Here, there, everywhere. People will look back on my tyranny as the good old days. | will be the mirror of their future.”\n“But it will be terrible!” she objected.\nShe could have no other reaction, he thought.\nHe said: “As the land refuses to support the people, the survivors will crowd into smaller and smaller refuges. A terrible selection process will be repeated on many worlds— explosive birthrates and dwindling food.”\n“But couldn’t the Guild...”\n“The Guild will be largely helpless without sufficient melange to operate available transports.”\n“Won't the rich escape?”\n“Some of them.”\n“Then you haven’t really changed anything. We will just go on struggling and dying.”\n“Until the sandworm reigns once more on Arrakis. We will have tested ourselves by then with a profound experience Shared by all. We will have learned that a thing which can happen on one planet can happen on any planet.”\n“So much pain and death,” she whispered.\n“Don’t you understand about death?” he asked. “You must understand. The species must understand. All life must understand.”\n“Help me, Lord,” she whispered.\n“It is the most profound experience of any creature,” he said. “Short of death come the things which risk and mirror it—life-threatening diseases, injuries and accidents... childbirth for a woman... and once it was combat for the males.”\n“But your Fish Speakers are...”\n“They teach about survival,” he said.\nHer eyes went wide with understanding. “The survivors. Of course!”\n“How precious you are,” he said. “How rare and precious. Bless the Ixians!”\n“And curse them?”\n“That, too.”\n“I did not think | could ever understand about your Fish Speakers,” she said.\n“Not even Moneo sees it,” he said. “And | despair of the Duncans.”\n“You have to appreciate life before you want to preserve it,” she said.\n“And it’s the survivors who maintain the most light and poignant hold upon the beauties of living. Women know this more often than men because birth is the reflection of death.”\n“My Uncle Malky always said you had good reasons for denying combat and casual violence to men. What a bitter\nlesson!”\n“Without readily available violence, men have few ways of testing how they will meet that final experience,” he said. “Something is missing. The psyche does not grow. What is it people say about Leto’s Peace?”\n“That you make us wallow in pointless decadence like pigs in our own filth.”\n“Always recognize the accuracy of folk wisdom,” he said. “Decadence.”\n“Most men have no principles,” she said. “The women of Ix complain about it constantly.”\n“When I need to identify rebels, | look for men with principles,” he said.\nShe stared at him silently, and he thought how that simple reaction spoke so deeply of her intelligence.\n“Where do you think | find my best administrators?” he asked.\nA small gasp escaped her.\n“Principles,” he said, “are what you fight for. Most men go through a lifetime unchallenged, except at the final moment. They have so few unfriendly arenas in which to test themselves.”\n“They have you,” she said.\n“But | am so powerful,” he said. “I am the equivalent of suicide. Who would seek certain death?”\n“Madmen... or desperate ones. Rebels?”\n“I am their equivalent of war,” he said. “The ultimate predator. | am the cohesive force which shatters them.”\n“I’ve never thought of myself as a rebel,” she said.\n“You are something far better.”\n“And you would use me in some way?”\n“| would.”\n“Not as an administrator,” she said.\n“I already have good administrators—uncorruptible, sagacious, philosophical and open about their errors, quick to see decisions.”\n“They were rebels?”\n“Most of them.”\n“How are they chosen?”\n“I could say they chose themselves.”\n“By surviving?”\n“That, too. But there’s more.
