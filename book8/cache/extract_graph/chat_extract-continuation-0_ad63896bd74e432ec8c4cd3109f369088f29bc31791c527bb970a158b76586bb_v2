�力。其次，必须要有足够强的精神力做基础。经过联邦科学院研究，人类的精神力强弱和悟性呈正相关，所以，精神力越强，在复杂的战舰驾驶之中能够融会贯通的可能性就会更大。学习战舰驾驶基础的精神力要求是五十点。真正成为战舰驾驶员的精神力要求是二百点。这个也是你们需要考虑的。”\n\n    “从咱们高能少年班的情况来看，老师们其实并不是太希望你们选择战舰驾驶基础作为副职业，因为这会消耗你们极大的精力，而对个人战斗力增强并没有太多的好处。这并非我们高能少年班的初衷。但学院也同样会尊重你们的选择，最终的决定权还是在你们手中。”\n\n    接下来，老师又开始讲述有关战舰驾驶基础的一些其他注意事项。\n\n    绝大多数学员听的都不是很认真，因为对他们来说，心中早就已经有了决定要选择什么。而蓝轩宇却听的津津有味。他的目标就是希望能够成为一名战舰驾驶员啊！双甲流他也很喜欢，可是，他更喜欢那种操控一个大战舰飞行的感觉。尤其是经历了宇宙航行之后，他对于宇宙的好奇心就更是大增。\n\n    “你喜欢这个？”身边的钱磊碰了碰他。\n\n    “嗯嗯。”蓝轩宇点了点头。\n------------\n\n第八十五章 精神力第一的钱磊\n\n    钱磊嘿嘿一笑，“我还以为你会选择双甲流呢。咱班估计绝大部分都会选择双甲流的。未来能够成为斗铠师，可是相当了不得的实情。你不考虑一下吗？”\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“斗铠我也很喜欢的，我还有金龙月语和银龙舞麟两个手办呢。可是，战舰驾驶我从小就特别喜欢，我不想放过。我打算选斗铠师和战舰驾驶基础两门副职业，你觉得怎么样？”\n\n    钱磊道：“不怎么样啊！双甲流因为机甲和斗铠有共通之处，譬如锻造什么的。可战舰驾驶与斗铠可是南辕北辙的，这必定需要更多的时间和努力，你可要想好了啊！老师刚才不是还在说，副职业如果选错了也很难更改。你魂力本来就不算太高的，要是选两个南辕北辙的副职业，估计就会消耗你更多的时间，不太好吧。”\n\n    “谢谢你，那我再想想。你呢？你选什么？”蓝轩宇好奇的问道。\n\n    “战舰驾驶基础啊！”钱磊很自然的说道。\n\n    “……”蓝轩宇嘴角抽搐了一下，“你刚才不是还劝我来着？”\n\n    钱磊嘿嘿一笑，“我不一样啊！你别看我武魂不靠谱，可是，我学东西特别快的呀。我精神力可是全班第一的。不然的话，你以为我是怎么被录取进来的？真的只是不靠谱的召唤啊？\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
