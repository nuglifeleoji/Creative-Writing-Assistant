\n　　“啊？你在什么地方哩？”金波惊讶了。 \n　　“我在阳沟给人家做活……刚结工。” \n　　“那你为什么不来找我？” \n　　“抽不开身……” \n　　“你先坐着，叫我给你弄饭去！” \n　　金波给他冲了一杯茶，也不再说什么，就匆忙地出了门。 \n　　少平也不阻挡金波为他张罗，他到了这里，就象回到家里一样，不必作假说他吃过饭了；实际上，他现在肚子里空空如也。 \n　　不到半个钟头，金波就端回大半脸盆手提白面片，里面还泡五六个荷包蛋。他从桌斗里拿出碗筷，一边给他盛面，一边说：“你来我太高兴了！我早听说你已经不教书……我也想过，你不会死守在双水村！” \n　　“你也吃！”少平端起一大碗面片，先把一颗鸡蛋扒拉在嘴边。 \n　　“我吃过了。”金波坐在一边开始抽烟，满意地看着少平吃得狼吞虎咽。 \n　　“我大概吃不了这么多……” \n　　“我知道你的饭量哩！” \n　　少平噙一嘴饭，笑了。是的，他一个人完全可以消灭这半脸盆面片。 \n　　这时候，少平才注意到，金波已经换了一身破烂工装，整齐的头发抖弄得乱蓬蓬地耷拉在额头。他心里立刻明白，敏感的金波猜出他目前的真实处境是什么样，因此，为不刺激他，才故意换上这身破衣服，显得和他处在一种同等的地位。他们相互太了解了，任何细微的心理反应都瞒哄不了对方。“你现在的情况怎样？”少平端起第二碗面片，问他的朋友。 \n　　“我实际上也是个揽工小子。参加工作不可能，只好临时给人家扛邮包；因此，也上不了车，只能偷偷摸摸跟我爸跑出去学两天。话说回来，没有正式工作，学会开车又能怎样？”“那你爸再没办法了？” \n　　“有什么办法？他是个普通工人，唯一的办法就是他提前退休，让我顶替他招工。可我又不忍心。他才四十九岁，没工作闲呆着，也难受啊……” \n　　少平不再言语了。他现在明白，他的朋友的处境的确也不比他强多少。只是他父亲在这城里有工作，他不至于象他一样动不动就得流落街头罢了。少平看见，这房子里搁两张床，显然是金波父子俩一块住着；房子里另外也没什么摆设。在双水村人的想象中，金俊海不知在黄原享什么福。但出门人很快就能知道，在这个城市里，金俊海就是个“穷人”。“你现在出了门，你就知道，外面并不是天堂。但一个男子汉，老守在咱双水村那个土圪崂里，又有什么意思？人就得闯世事！安安稳稳活一辈子，还不如�\n######################\nOutput:",
