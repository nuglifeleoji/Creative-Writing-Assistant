漫长的半个小时过去了，叶文洁在这期间重设了发射频率，将其置于太阳能量镜面反射的最优值上．将发射功率设为最大值，然后，她将双限凑近光学定位系统的目镜．看到太阳正在升出地平线。她启动了天线定位系统，缓缓转动方向杆使其对准太阳。巨型天线转动时产生的隆隆震动传进主控室，有一名值班员又看了叶文洁一眼，但也没说什么。\n     太阳完全升出了天边连绵的山脊．红岸天线定位器的十字丝的中心对在它的上缘．这是考虑了电渡运行的提前量，发射系统已处于就绪状态。发射按钮呈长方形．很像电脑键盘上的空格键，-但是红色的。这时．叶文洁的手指悬在它上面两厘米处。\n     人类文明的命运．就系于这纤细的两指之上。\n     毫不犹豫地．叶文洁按下了发射键。\n  “干什么?”一名值班员带着睡意问。\n     叶文洁冲他笑了笑，没有说话。随即按下另一个黄键中止了发射，又转动方向杆改变了天线的指向然后离开控制台向外走去。\n     那个值班员看看表，也该下班了，他拿起日志，想把叶文洁刚才启动发射系统的操作记下来，这多少有些异常，但他看看一条记录纸带．发现她只将发射系统启动了不到三秒钟，于是将日志扔回原位，打了个哈欠，戴上军帽走了。正在飞向太阳的信息是：\n     到这里来吧，我将帮助你们获得这个世界．我的文明已无力解决自己的问题，需要你们的力量来介入。\n     初升的太阳使叶文洁头晕目眩，出门后没有走出多远．她就昏倒在草地上。\n     睡来后，她发现自己躺在医务室中，扬卫宁在床边关切地看着她，像多年前在飞机上那样。医生让叶文洁以后注意休息，因为她怀孕了。\n24．叛乱\n     叶文洁讲述完这段历史后，大厅陷入一片静默，在场的许多人显然也是第一次听到这么完整的讲述．汪淼也被深深地吸引了，暂时忘记了目前的危险和恐惧，不由问道：\n     “那么，三体组织是如何发展到这个规模的呢?”\n     叶文洁回答：  “这要从我认识伊文斯说起……不过，这段历史在场的同志们都知道，我们就不要在这上面浪费时间了．以后我可以单独为你讲，但是否有这个机会，就要看你自己了……小汪，我们还是谈谈你的纳米材料吧，”\n     “你们所说的……主。为什么这样害怕纳米材料呢?”汪淼问。\n     “因为它能够使人类摆脱地球引力，大规模进入太空。”\n     “太空电梯?”汪淼立刻想到了。\n     “是的，那种超高强度的材料一旦能够大规模生产，建设从地表直达地球同步轨道的太空电梯就有了技术基础。对主而言，这只是一项很小的发明，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>叶文洁<|>PERSON<|>叶文洁 is a key
