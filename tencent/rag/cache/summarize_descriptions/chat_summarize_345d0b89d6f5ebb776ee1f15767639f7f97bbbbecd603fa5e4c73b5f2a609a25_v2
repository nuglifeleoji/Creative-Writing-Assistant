As Paul's weapons master, Duncan played a critical role in training and safeguarding him, embodying both mentorship and fierce loyalty. His dedication extended beyond duty, as he was also a close companion to Paul, sharing a bond of mutual respect and camaraderie.  \n\nDuncan's loyalty was most starkly demonstrated when he sacrificed his life to ensure the escape of Paul and Jessica, rescuing them and hiding them in the desert during a time of dire peril. Even in captivity, Duncan resisted his captors, a testament to his unyielding allegiance to House Atreides, as later referenced by Paul.  \n\nThough descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing his role as a swordmaster, others as a protector or companion—the consistent thread is Duncan's profound loyalty and self-sacrifice for Paul and the Atreides family.
