\n　　家里人吃惊之余，又看她这样认真，就向他们所有在门外的亲戚和熟人委托，让这些人给他们的秀莲在外地寻个对象…… \n　　本来秀莲只是随便这么说说；她并没指望真能在外地找个合适的男人。她想，一定不行了，过两年也就在本地挑选个人——反正不能一辈子老呆在娘家的门上。 \n　　可是，突然在她面前出现了个外地人孙少安！ \n　　秀莲一见少安的面，就惊喜得心嘣嘣乱跳：天啊，这就是她要找的那个人嘛！他长得多帅！本地她还没见过这么展扬的后生！再说，这人身上有一股很强的悍性，叫一个女人觉得，跟上这种男人，讨吃要饭都是放心的；只要拉着他的手，就对任何事不怯心了。相比之下，本地那些想和她相好的小伙子，一个个都成了毛手毛脚的猴球小子！ \n　　她马上把自己一颗年轻而热情的心，交给了这个远路上来的小伙子。当少安一再说他家如何如何穷的时候，她连听也不想听。穷怕什么！只要你娶我，再穷我也心甘情愿跟你走！ \n　　她爱上少安后，就舍不得离开他了。依她的想法，她即刻就准备跟少安回去结婚。但亲爱的少安哥说这太仓促了，他歪好得回去准备一下，最早看明年后半年能不能办事。 \n　　她只好收回了马上结婚的打算，但绝对不同意明年后半年才结婚！她提出：最迟在春节就办事！ \n　　少安拗不过她烈火似的感情，也就同意了。 \n　　当她把他强留了一个月，他不回家再不行的时候，她就又撵着他来了。她生怕他象一只鹰似的飞去再不返回来……现在，她来到双水村少安家里，就象回到了她自己的家。由于她热爱自己的心上人，对这个穷家的确没一点不满意，反而觉得一切都很亲切、很入眼……有文化的城里人，往往不能想象农村姑娘的爱情生活。在他们看来，也许没有文化就等于没有头脑；没有头脑就不懂得多少感情。可是实际也许和这种偏见恰恰相反。真的，正由于她们知识不多，精神不会太分散，对于两性之间的感情非常专注，所以这种感情实际上更丰富，更强烈。 \n　　秀莲到少安家，转眼间七八天就过去了，但她还是不愿意走。少安背转他家里的人，偷偷对她说：“你走时给家里人说，你住四五天就回来了，因此你也不要耽搁太久，要不你爸和你姐他们要操心的。” \n　　她只是不好意思地抠着手指头，红着脸说：“我……舍不得离开你……” \n　　少安亲热地对她说：“你先回去，春节前我就寻你来！”“再让我住\n######################\nOutput:",
