Initially a Fremen **Naib** and **lieutenant**, he serves as a loyal follower of Paul, participating in security, combat operations, and administrative duties. As a member of the **Fedaykin**, he is deeply involved in military planning, including strategies against the Harkonnens.  \n\nKorba also holds significant religious and political roles. He is a **Qizara**, a high-ranking religious official in the **Qizarate**, and a member of the **Imperial Council**. In this capacity, he engages in ceremonial duties, delivers historical records to Paul and Stilgar, and voices strong opinions on matters such as the Guild's influence. His fanatical devotion to Muad'Dib is evident in his reverence for religious constitutions and his involvement in the empire's power structures.  \n\nHowever, Korba's legacy is marked by controversy. As the **Panegyrist**, he wields considerable religious authority but is later accused of **treason** and brought before the Grand Council for judgment. He is linked to the destruction of **water traps** and **qanats**, the theft of a **sandworm**, and the possession of a **stone burner** from Tarahell. Some accounts describe him as an enemy of the empire who exploited religious drama for the Qizarate, ultimately leading to his **execution**.  \n\nDespite these contradictions, Korba remains a pivotal figure—both a devoted lieutenant and a zealous priest whose ambitions and actions contribute to his downfall. His dual roles as a **military leader** and **religious official** underscore the tensions between loyalty and power within Paul’s regime.\",23\n669,QIZARATE,\"The **Qizarate** is a powerful religious and political organization within the Fremen hierarchy, serving as the primary religious bureaucracy of **Paul Muad'Dib's (Atreides)** empire. It enforces and administers the worship of Paul as a divine figure, spreading his religious doctrines and overseeing ceremonies. The Qizarate played a central role in the **Jihad**, acting as missionaries to expand Paul's influence across the Imperium.  \n\nInitially, the Qizarate was a priestly order within the **Fremen religious hierarchy**, present in **Alia's Fane of the Oracle**, but it evolved into a vast religious government that replaced traditional civil services with bishoprics. While its primary function was to uphold Paul's godhead, the organization was not without internal strife. Under **Korba's** leadership, factions within the Qizarate plotted against Paul and **Chani**, leading to treachery and internal treason. Some, like **Edric**, questioned the sincerity of its members, suspecting political motives behind their religious fervor.  \n\nDespite its role in enforcing orthodoxy, the Qizarate was implicated in **Korba's rebellion**, revealing fractures within the organization. It was also involved in the defense of **Arrakis**, though its political ambitions sometimes clashed with Paul's rule. The **Zabulon computations** further highlight its missionary activities during Paul's campaigns.  \n\nIn summary, the Qizarate was both a unifying and destabilizing force—officially the religious arm of Muad'Dib's empire, yet plagued by dissent and conspiracy. It shaped the empire's spiritual and political landscape, though its loyalty remained contested.\",6\n821,DJEDIDA,\"Djedida is named as one of the traitors among the Naibs, formerly secretary to Korba.\",3\n804,RAJIFIRI,\"Rajifiri is a Naib in the gallery, implicated in Korba's treachery by his reactions during the interrogation.\"\"\",1\n805,SAAJID,\"Saajid is another Naib implicated in Korba's treachery.\"\"\",1\n806,MERKUR,\"Merkur is a Naib who fled Arrakis with the stolen worm.\"\"\",1\n807,FASH,\"Fash is a Naib who fled Arrakis with the stolen worm.\"\"\",1\n808,KEKE THE LAME,\"Keke the Lame is a Naib absent from the Council, implicated in the plot.\"\"\",1\n809,TAKIM,\"Takim is a Naib who fled Arrakis with the stolen worm.\"\"\",1\n812,WORM THEFT,\"The theft of a sandworm from Arrakis is a central event in the plot, implicating Korba and others.\"\"\",1\n798,STONE BURNER,\"The **Stone Burner** is a forbidden weapon of mass destruction, infamous for its catastrophic capabilities and association with treachery. Linked to **Korba's betrayal**, it is capable of annihilating entire planets or inflicting severe harm, such as blinding individuals. Notably, the weapon was used to blind **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)** and others, marking a pivotal event with far-reaching consequences.  \n\nIts deployment violates the **Great Convention**, the universal law prohibiting the use of such devastating arms, and has incited widespread fear and political upheaval across the Imperium.
