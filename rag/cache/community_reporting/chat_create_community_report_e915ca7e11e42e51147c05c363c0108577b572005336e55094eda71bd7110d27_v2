As a ghola, he possesses the potential to restore the memories of his original self, making him a pivotal figure in Bene Gesserit schemes and broader narrative events. Trained as a mentat and a skilled warrior, he serves Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib) with loyalty, offering both strategic insight and philosophical challenges to Paul’s rule.  \n\nGHOLA’s role is multifaceted: he is both a servant and a destabilizing force. His presence unsettles Alia, who perceives him as mysterious and potentially dangerous, while his interactions with Paul serve as an emotional and ideological counterpoint. His metal eyes mark him as a Tleilaxu creation, and he is often entangled in political conspiracies, including negotiations and covert missions.  \n\nAt times, GHOLA is captured or controlled by factions such as Murbella’s group, highlighting his value as a strategic asset. Under the Bene Gesserit’s supervision—particularly by Lucilla and Teg—he undergoes rigorous training, further honing his abilities. Whether as a weapon, a philosophical provocateur, or a pawn in larger schemes, GHOLA remains a central and enigmatic figure whose restored memories and actions drive key events in the narrative.  \n\nIn summary, GHOLA is a clone of Duncan Idaho, embodying his original skills and memories while serving as a tool, a mentor, and a wildcard in the power struggles surrounding Paul Muad’Dib and the Bene Gesserit. His existence blurs the line between resurrection and manipulation, making him a source of tension, intrigue, and pivotal narrative developments.\",11\r\n951,LUCILA,\"**Lucilla** is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Imprinter, a highly trained operative of the Sisterhood with expertise in seduction, psychological manipulation, and Voice. She is primarily tasked with the conditioning and protection of the ghola Duncan Idaho, using advanced imprinting techniques to bond him to the Bene Gesserit. Her role involves teaching Duncan about love in all its forms, employing both emotional and sexual manipulation as tools for his training. Lucilla is cautious, perceptive, and skilled in combat, with access to Other Memories, which inform her decisions.  \n\nAssigned to replace Geasa in Duncan’s education, Lucilla exhibits a cold demeanor and seductive eyes, resembling Odrade due to careful Bene Gesserit breeding. She is involved in political maneuvers around Duncan, often clashing with figures like Schwangyu over alliances with the Tleilaxu. Her loyalty to the Sisterhood is generally unwavering, though her actions are sometimes scrutinized, and she faces conflicting orders regarding Duncan’s conditioning.  \n\nAt times, Lucilla works alongside Miles Teg to safeguard Duncan, though she questions his methods and remains suspicious of his behavioral changes. She is also associated with Gammu Keep, where she operates in disguise, navigating the planet’s dangers with Burzmali while carrying critical intelligence for the Sisterhood. Her mission occasionally extends beyond Duncan’s training, including involvement in strategic operations against the Honored Matres.  \n\nLucilla’s story takes darker turns: she is captured by the Honored Matres on Junction, enduring interrogation and deprivation as leverage against the Bene Gesserit. In some accounts, she is killed by the Great Honored Matre, highlighting the violent conflict between the two groups. Other narratives place her missing alongside Teg and Duncan or in hiding on Gammu, hunted by a Guild Navigator.  \n\nDespite her disciplined exterior, Lucilla experiences emotional turmoil, including hatred toward the people of Rakis. She is a complex figure—ruthless yet strategic, manipulative yet devoted—embodying the Bene Gesserit’s calculated approach to power and survival. Whether as a teacher, captive, or fugitive, her actions remain pivotal to the Sisterhood’s plans.\",27\r\n1105,TANTRUS,\"Tantrus is a religious group that worships through sex, considered dangerous by Sirafa\",1\r\n1209,LAMPADAS HORDE,\"A Bene Gesserit group urging Lucilla to endure and gather tactical information\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2317,TEG,GHOLA,\"Teg is involved in the training and supervision of the ghola, ensuring its progress under Bene Gesserit directives.\",86\r\n2119,LUCILA,TARAZA,\"**LUCILA and TARAZA**  \n\nTaraza, the Mother Superior, has issued a directive to Lucilla, instructing her to imprint the ghola Duncan Idaho.

The phrasing differs slightly—one mentions \"\"restoring memories\"\" while the other specifies \"\"imprinting\"\"—but both emphasize Taraza's authority and Lucilla's role in executing this pivotal operation.  \n\nIn summary, Taraza, as the Mother Superior, has tasked Lucilla with the responsibility of imprinting Duncan Idaho's ghola, which includes restoring his memories to complete her assigned duty.
