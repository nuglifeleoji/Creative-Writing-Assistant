Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: “Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it’s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\nOval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.\nThrough the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the hall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.\nJessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her sliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.\nSurely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one individual’s hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And\nthere were ways to open any palm lock—as she had learned at school.\nJessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the lines—a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the surface.\nShe felt the click.\nBut there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.\n“There are men in the great hall say they’ve been sent by the Duke to get young master Paul,” Mapes said. “They've the ducal signet and the guard has identified them.” She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.\nA cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That’s a good sign.\n“He’s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,” Jessica said. “If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next room. Paul may require a wakeshot.”\nAgain, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.\nHawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can’t be anything too terrible in here.\nShe pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.\nAn airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, Saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat’s personal mark. The door was left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.\nShe stepped over the lip into the little room.\nWhy an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in Special climates.\nSpecial climate!\nThat would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing things had to be irrigated. The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open securely with the stick\nHawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She recognized Galach words, read:\n“O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God’s Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.”\nJessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.\nA yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Fi/ter glass!\nShe stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.\n“A wet-planet conservatory,” she breathed.\nPotted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso...roses....\nEven roses!\nShe bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room.\nRhythmic noise invaded her senses.\nShe parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a- gallop onto the metal bowl.\nJessica sent herself through the quick sense- clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the room’s perimeter. It appeared to be about ten meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original building’s completion.\nShe stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock- set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.\nWater everywhere in this room—on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life. Water being\nwasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness.\nShe glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting Known as the Shield Wall.\nFilter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn’t been time. And he’s been busy with more serious problems.\nShe recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust.\nBut this room embodied a statement far more Significant than the lack of waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis— possibly more.\nJessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat’s daysigns on it, studied a message written on the pad:\n“TO THE LADY JESSICA—\nMay this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.\nMy kindest wishes, MARGOT LADY FENRING”\nJessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor’s former proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count married his Lady.\nEven as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: “On that path lies danger.”\nJessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots. Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.\nSomething in the position of the pad? she wondered.\nBut Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:\n“Your son and the Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection.” Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots: “l do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that | cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.”\nJessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.\n“Paul!” She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. “What is that?”\nHe spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: “Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my\nroom and smashed its nose, but | want to be Sure. Water should short it out.”\n“Immerse it!” she commanded.\nHe obeyed.\nPresently, she said: “Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.”\nHe brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.\nIt was dead.\nShe dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized—the B.G. Way.\n“This place could conceal anything,” he said.\n“I’ve reason to believe it’s safe,” she said.\n“My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said—”\n“It was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.”\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: ^“... defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n“Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,” he said. “That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.”\n“The Shadout Mapes,” Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. “A summons from your father to—”\n“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c936c681e29abe89c10ca97f243009605a5158f75afd18f0fbb6c963526c58f9_v2"}
