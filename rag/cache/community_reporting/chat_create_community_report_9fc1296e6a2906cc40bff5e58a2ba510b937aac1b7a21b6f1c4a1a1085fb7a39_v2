It stands in stark contrast to the surrounding desert, symbolizing the transformative changes brought by **Leto II's** rule. The forest is bordered by the **Sareer** and is visible from **Moneo's workroom**, emphasizing its proximity to Leto's city.  \n\nA place of both ecological and symbolic significance, the Forbidden Forest is filled with the scents of **resin and damp duff**, and its terrain is marked by **moon shadows**. It is home to **Leto's symbolic D-wolves**, which patrol the area, guarding the Sareer and pursuing runners. The forest has been a site of **rebel attacks**, adding to its dangerous reputation.  \n\nThe forest holds deep personal meaning for **Siona Atreides**, who once endured a desperate run through its depths and made a solemn oath at the edge of a river. This event underscores the forest's role as a place of trial and transformation.  \n\nMentioned in the context of the **Royal Road**, the Forbidden Forest is a recurring landmark in the narratives of Arrakis, blending natural beauty with lurking peril. Its lush greenery against the harsh desert backdrop serves as a testament to Leto's engineered ecological shifts, making it a powerful symbol of his reign.\",6\n1253,CITADEL,\"**The Citadel** is the formidable seat of power for Leto II, the God Emperor, serving as both his primary residence and the administrative heart of his empire. Located in the Sareer on Arrakis, it is a massive, fortified structure featuring towers, advanced Ixian technology, and extensive underground catacombs housing Fish Speaker facilities, melange hoards, and hidden secrets. The Citadel functions as a hub for political, military, and historical affairs, where Leto holds court, conducts state business, and meets with key figures like Duncan Idaho and Siona.  \n\nIt is a secure stronghold where Leto stores valuable resources, including vast spice reserves, and where damaged items—such as his canopy—are repaired. The Citadel also serves as an archive, preserving records of Leto’s transformation and the empire’s history. Significant events unfold here, from strategic discussions between Leto and Idaho to confrontations with rebels like Siona, who once stole plans or items from the fortress. The Fish Speakers operate within its corridors, overseeing detainees like Siona and escorting figures such as Idaho to and from locations like Tuono Village or Goygoa.  \n\nAt times, the Citadel is a focal point of conflict, whether as the Honored Matres' last stand at Junction or the starting point for desert journeys. Despite its impregnable reputation, it remains a center of intrigue, with rebels targeting its secrets and Leto’s courtiers departing for missions. The Citadel’s perimeter is routinely inspected, reinforcing its status as the God Emperor’s unassailable bastion and the symbolic core of his rule.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",14\n1247,MUSEUM FREMEN,\"**Summary of the Museum Fremen:**  \n\nThe **Museum Fremen** are a cultural group descended from the original Fremen, now dedicated to preserving the traditions, artifacts, and history of their ancestors under the rule of the God Emperor Leto II. They reside in various locations, including **Tabur Village**, **Tuono**, **False Sietch**, and areas near the **Sareer** and the **Wall**, where they tend to plants, date palms, and maintain remnants of Fremen life. While they strive to uphold ancient customs—such as crafting and selling contraband items like crysknife replicas—they are often criticized as mere imitators who lack true understanding of their forebears' warrior ethos. Some view them as degenerate descendants, having lost the original Fremen values, while others see them as caretakers of Leto II’s legacy on **Rakis**.  \n\nTheir role is complex: they submit petitions, interact with travelers, and are occasionally encountered during significant events, such as the **God Emperor’s visit** or the **climb of the Wall**. However, their authenticity has been compromised; they were once impersonated by **Face Dancers** disguised as pilgrims on the **Royal Road**, leading to suspicion about their true nature. Despite this, they remain a preserved institution, maintained by Leto II, and are distinct from traditional Fremen—though still feared by figures like **Duncan Idaho**, who encountered their artifacts in his quarters.  \n\nLed by **Garun**, the Museum Fremen function as modern practitioners, performing and safeguarding Fremen traditions as cultural relics rather than living them. Their existence reflects both reverence for the past and the inevitable dilution of their heritage under the God Emperor’s rule.\",13\n1450,TABUR VILLAGE,\"**Tabur Village** is a settlement located in the Sareer region, near the boundary wall, known for its relatively developed infrastructure compared to neighboring Tuono Village. It is a water-rich area inhabited by Museum Fremen, who cultivate plants and date palms. Initially, Tabur Village was planned as the location for Leto II's wedding ceremony, but the venue was later changed to Tuono Village. Despite this change, some sources still refer to Tabur as the intended or primary location for the event, highlighting its significance within the Sareer. The village's abundance of water and agricultural activity distinguishes it as a vital and thriving community in the region.\",6\n1243,SARER,\"**Summary of the Sareer:**  \n\nThe **Sareer** is a vast, barren desert region on **Arrakis (Dune)**, serving as the last remnant of the planet's once-dominant deserts. It is a place of extreme desolation, characterized by scorching heat, mirages, and a fluid horizon, symbolizing both the harshness of the landscape and the transformative nature of the events that unfold within it. The Sareer is closely associated with **Leto II, the God Emperor**, who rules over it as his sanctuary and testing ground.  \n\nLocated near **Leto’s Citadel**, the Sareer is enclosed by high cliffs, ridges, and man-made barriers, including a massive wall constructed from materials taken from a former mountain named after **Duncan Idaho**. The region is strategically significant, functioning as a controlled environment where weather patterns—such as rare rainfall at its edges—are regulated by satellite controllers. Despite its aridity, cool air is drawn into the Citadel from the desert, sustaining the fortress.  \n\nThe Sareer holds deep personal and political importance. It is a place of **memory and testing**, where Leto and his followers, including **Siona Atreides**, undergo pivotal experiences. Siona, in particular, is tested here as part of her preparation for leadership. The desert also contrasts sharply with the lush landscapes observed elsewhere on Arrakis, emphasizing its role as a relic of the planet’s past.  \n\nGeographically, the Sareer lies opposite **the Wall**, where Idaho peers down, and is bordered by the **Idaho River**. It is home to **Tabur Village** and serves as the last refuge for those fleeing the Citadel, including the runners who escape its confines. The region is frequently referenced in **charts studied by Idaho and Leto**, reinforcing its centrality to the empire’s governance.  \n\nIn summary, the **Sareer** is more than just a desert—it is a **symbol of Leto’s rule**, a **testing ground for survival and leadership**, and the **last vestige of Arrakis’s ancient identity**. Its stark, unforgiving landscape mirrors the challenges faced by those who navigate its sands, making it a cornerstone of the narrative’s setting and themes.\",10\n1246,IDAHO RIVER,\"The **Idaho River** is a significant geographical and symbolic feature on the planet Rakis, closely tied to the legacy of Duncan Idaho and the reign of the Tyrant Leto II. It served as a key landmark along the Royal Road, near which confrontations with the Museum Fremen occurred, and was crossed by a faery bridge as part of a journey's route. Flowing near the settlement of Onn, the river shares its name with Duncan Idaho, reflecting his enduring influence.  \n\nThe Idaho River flowed southward beyond the Sareer's boundary wall, visible under moonlight and audible through the ground, suggesting its presence was both seen and felt. For Kwuteg, it represented a sanctuary, symbolizing safety from the predatory D-wolves. Duncan Idaho himself reflected upon the river during a conversation with Moneo, noting its tamed nature within the Sareer region. Siona later crossed it to escape a wolf pack, marking the boundary of the Forbidden Forest.  \n\nThe river was also a man-made waterway, flowing through a canyon, embodying the planet's transformation under Leto II's rule. However, its fate shifted dramatically over time. Once a vital feature on Rakis, it eventually vanished, leaving only dry remnants near the Sareer. It was here that the Tyrant met his end, falling from his bridge into what was once the riverbed.  \n\nDespite contradictions in its state—described both as flowing and later dry—the Idaho River's significance remains clear. It was a place of passage, conflict, and reflection, deeply intertwined with the planet's history and the figures who shaped it. Whether as a sanctuary, a boundary, or a symbol of Leto's rule, the Idaho River played a pivotal role in the events of Rakis before its eventual disappearance.\",9\n1398,FALSE SIETCH,\"False Sietch is a large, free-form building at the edge of Onn, serving as a school and historical site for the Museum Fremen>\",2\n1457,TOWER,\"Leto's tower is his residence and observation point, featuring an aerie and a balcony with a view of the surrounding land.\"\"\",3\n1266,DISPLAY SIETCH,\"**Display Sietch** is a recreated Fremen cave village located in the Sareer region, designed to showcase traditional Fremen culture and way of life.
