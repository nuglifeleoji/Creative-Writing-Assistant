own decisions. Something she would not be required to explain to Murbella.\nHow do I soften the blow?\nThere were times when you could not soften it; in fact when it was kinder to rip off the bandages in one swift shot of agony.\n“Can this .. . this Duncan Idaho really give me back my memories from... before?”\n“He can and he will.”\n“Are we not being too precipitous?” Tamalane asked.\n“I’ve been studying accounts of the Bashar,” Teg said. “He was a famous military man and a Mentat.”\n“And you’re proud of that, | suppose?” Bell was taking out her objections on the boy.\n“Not especially.” He returned her gaze without flinching. “I think of him as someone else. Interesting, though.”\n“Someone else,” Bellonda muttered. She looked at Odrade with ill-concealed disagreement. “You're giving him the deep teaching!”\n“As his birth-mother did.”\n“Will | remember her?” Teg asked.\nOdrade gave him a conspiratorial smile, one they had Shared often in their orchard walks. “You will.”\n“Everything?”\n“You'll remember all of it—your wife, your children, the battles. Everything.”\n“Send him away!” Bellonda said.\nThe boy smiled but looked to Odrade, awaiting her command.\n“Very well, Miles,” Odrade said. “Tell Streggi to take you to your new quarters in the no-ship. l'II come along later and introduce you to Duncan.”\n“May I ride on Streggi’s shoulders?”\n“Ask her.”\nImpulsively, Teg dashed up to Odrade, lifted himself onto his toes and kissed her cheek. “I hope my real mother was like you.”\nOdrade patted his shoulder. “Very much like me. Run along now.”\nWhen the door closed behind him, Tamalane said: “You haven't told him you’re one of his daughters!”\n“Not yet.”\n“Will Idaho tell him?”\n“If it’s indicated.”\nBellonda was not interested in petty details. “What are you planning, Dar?”\nTamalane answered for her. “A punishment force commanded by our Mentat Bashar. It’s obvious.”\nShe took the bait!\n“Is that it?” Bellonda demanded.\nOdrade favored them both with a hard stare. “Teg was the best we ever had. If anyone can punish our enemies .. .”\n“We'd better start growing another one,” Tamalane said.\n“I don’t like the influence Murbella may have on him,” Bellonda said.\n“Will Idaho cooperate?” Tamalane asked.\n“He will do what an Atreides asks of him.”\nOdrade spoke with more confidence than she felt but the words opened her mind to another source of the alien feelings.\nI’m seeing us as Murbella sees us! I can think like at least one Honored Matre!\nWe do not teach history; we recreate the experience. We follow the chain of consequences—the tracks of the beast in its forest. Look behind our words and you see the broad sweep of social behavior that no historian has ever touched.\n—BENE GESSERIT PANOPLIA PROPHETICUS\nS cytale whistled while he walked down the corridor fronting his quarters, taking his afternoon exercise. Down and back. Whistling.\nGet them accustomed to me whistling.\nAs he whistled, he composed a ditty to go with the sound: “Tleilaxu sperm does not talk.” Over and over, the words rolled in his mind. They could not use his cells to bridge the genetic gap and learn his secrets.\nThey must come to me with gifts.\nOdrade had stopped by to see him earlier “on my way to confer with Murbella.” She mentioned the captive Honored Matre to him frequently. There was a purpose but he had no idea what it might be. Threat? Always possible. It would be revealed eventually.\n“| hope you are not fearful,” Odrade had said.\nThey had been standing at his food slot while he waited for lunch to appear. The menu was never quite to his liking but acceptable. Today, he had asked for seafood. No telling what form it would take.\n“Fearful? Of you? Ahhh, dear Mother Superior, | am priceless to you alive. Why should | fear?”\n“My Council reserves judgment on your latest requests.”\n| expected that.\n“It’s a mistake to hobble me,” he said. “Limits your choices. Weakens you.”\nThose words had taken several days of planning for him to compose. He waited for their effect.\n“It depends on how one intends to employ the tool, Master Scytale. Some tools break when you don’t use them properly.”\nDamn you, witch!\nHe smiled, showing his sharp canines. “Testing to extinction, Mother Superior?”\nShe made one of her rare sallies into humor. “Do you really expect me to strengthen you? For what do you bargain now, Scytale?”\nSo I’m no longer Master Scytale. Strike her with the flat of the blade!\n“You Scatter your Sisters, hoping some will escape destruction. What are the economic consequences of your hysterical reaction?”\nConsequences! They always talk about consequences.\n“We trade for time, Scytale.” Very solemn.\nHe gave this a silent moment of reflection. The comeyes were watching them. Never forget it! Economics, witch! Who and what do we buy and sell? This alcove by the food slot was a Strange place for bargaining, he thought. Bad management of the economy. The management hustle, the planning and strategy session, should occur behind closed doors, in high rooms with views that did not distract the occupants from the business at hand.\nThe serial memories of his many lives would not accept that. Necessity. Humans conduct their merchant affairs wherever they can—on the decks of sailing ships, in tawdry streets full of bustling clerks, in the spacious halls of a traditional bourse with information flowing above their heads for all to see.\nPlanning and strategy might come from those high rooms but the evidence of it was like the common information of the bourse—there for all to see.\nSo let the comeyes watch.\n“What are your intentions toward me, Mother Superior?”\n“To keep you alive and strong.”\nCareful, careful.\n“But not give me a free hand.”\n“Scytale! You speak of economics and then want something free?”\n“But my strength is important to you?”\n“Believe it!”\n“| do not trust you.”\nThe food slot took that moment to disgorge his lunch: a white fish sauteed in a delicate sauce. He smelled herbs. Water in a tall glass, faint aroma of melange. A green salad. One of their better efforts. He felt himself salivating.\n“Enjoy your lunch, Master Scytale. There is nothing in it to harm you. Is that not a measure of trust?”\nWhen he did not respond, she said: “What does trust have to do with our bargaining?”\nWhat game is she playing now?\n“You tell me what you intend for Honored Matres but you do not say what you intend for me.” He knew he sounded plaintive. Unavoidable.\n“I intend to make the Honored Matres aware of their mortality.”\n“As you do with me!”\nWas that satisfaction in her eyes?\n“Scytale.” How soft her voice. “People thus made aware truly listen. They hear you.” She glanced at his tray. “Would you like something special?”\nHe drew himself up as best he could. “A small stimulant drink. It helps when I must think.”\n“Of course. l'Il see that it’s sent down at once.” She turned her attention out of the alcove toward the main room of his quarters. He watched where she paused, her gaze Shifting from place to place, item to item.\nEverything in its place, witch. | am not an animal in its cave. Things must be convenient, where | can find them\nwithout thinking. Yes, those are stimpens beside my chair. So I use ‘pens. But I avoid alcohol. You notice?\nThe stimulant, when it came, tasted of a bitter herb he was a moment identifying. Casmine. A genetically modified blood strengthener from the Gammu pharmacopoeia.\nDid she intend to remind him of Gammu? They were so devious, these witches!\nPoking fun at him over the question of economics. He felt the sting of this as he turned at the end of his corridor and continued his exercise in a brisk walk back to his quarters. What glue had actually held the Old Empire together? Many things, some small and some large, but mostly economic. Lines of connection thought of often as conveniences. And what kept them from blasting one another out of existence? The Great Convention. “You blast anyone and we unite to blast you.”\nHe stopped outside his door, brought up short by a thought.\nWas that it? How could punishment be enough to stop the greedy powindah? Did it come down to a glue composed of intangibles? The censure of your peers? But what if your peers balked at no obscenity? You could do anything. And that said something about Honored Matres. It certainly did.\nHe longed for a sagra chamber in which to bare his soul.\nThe Yaghist is gone! Am | the last Masheikh?\nHis chest felt empty. It was an effort to breathe. Perhaps it would be best to bargain more openly with the women of Shaitan.\nNo! That is Shaitan himself tempting me!\nHe entered his chambers in a chastened mood.\nI must make them pay. Make them pay dearly. Dearly, dearly, dearly. Each dearly accompanied a step toward his chair. When he sat, his right hand reached out automatically for a ’pen. Soon, he felt his mind driving at speed, thoughts pouring through in marvelous array.\nThey do not guess how well I know the Ixian ship. It’s here in my head.\nHe spent the next hour deciding how he would record these moments when it came time to tell his fellows how he had triumphed over the powindah. With God’s help!\nThey would be glittering words, filled with drama and the tensions of his testing. History, after all, was always written by the victors.\nThey say Mother Superior can disregard nothing—a meaningless aphorism until you grasp its other significance: | am the servant of all my Sisters. They watch their servant with critical eyes. | cannot spend too much time on generalities nor on trivia. Mother Superior must display insightful action else a sense of disquiet penetrates to the farthest corners of our order.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nS omething of what Odrade called “my servant-self” went with her as she walked the halls of Central this morning, making this her exercise rather than take time on a practice floor.

Nothing else would serve.\nSo what am |?\n“Who asks that question?” It was a skewering thrust from Other Memory.\nOdrade laughed aloud and a passing Proctor named Praska stared at her in astonishment. Odrade waved to Praska and said: “It’s good to be alive. Remember that.”\nPraska produced a faint smile before going on about her business.\nSo who asks: What am I?\nDangerous question. Asking it put her in a universe where nothing was quite human. Nothing matched the undefined thing she sought. All around her, clowns, wild animals and puppets reacted to the pull of hidden strings. She sensed the strings that jerked her into movement.\nOdrade continued along the corridor toward the tube that would take her up to her quarters.\nStrings. What came with the egg? We speak glibly of “the mind at its beginning.” But what was I before the pressures of living shaped me?\nIt wasn’t enough to seek something “natural.” No “Noble Savage.” She had seen plenty of those in her lifetime. The strings jerking them were quite visible to a Bene Gesserit.\nShe felt the taskmaster within her. Strong today. It was a force she sometimes disobeyed or avoided. Taskmaster said: “Strengthen your talents. Do not flow gently in the current. Swim! Use it or lose it.”\nWith a gasping sensation of near panic, she realized she had barely retained her humanity, that she had been on the point of losing it.\nI’ve been trying too hard to think like an Honored Matre! Manipulating and maneuvering anyone I could. And all in the name of Bene Gesserit survival!\nBell said there were no limits beyond which the Sisterhood would refuse to go in preserving the Bene Gesserit. A modicum of truth in this boast but it was the\ntruth of all boasting. There were indeed things a Reverend Mother would not do to save the Sisterhood.\nWe would not block the Tyrant’s Golden Path.\nSurvival of humankind took precedence over survival of the Sisterhood. Else our grail of human maturity is meaningless.\nBut oh, the perils of leadership in a species so anxious to be told what to do. How little they knew of what they created by their demands. Leaders made mistakes. And those mistakes, amplified by the numbers who followed without questioning, moved inevitably toward great disasters.\nLemming behavior.\nIt was right that her Sisters watched her carefully. All governments needed to remain under suspicion during their time of power including that of the Sisterhood itself. Trust no government! Not even mine!\nThey are watching me this very instant. Very little escapes my Sisters. They will know my plan in time.\nIt required constant mental cleansing to face up to the fact of her great power over the Sisterhood. / did not seek this power. It was thrust upon me. And she thought: Power attracts the corruptible. Suspect all who seek it. She knew the chances were great that such people were susceptible to corruption or already lost.\nOdrade made a mental note to scribe and transmit a Coda memo to Archives. (Let Bell sweat this one!) “We should grant power over our affairs only to those who are reluctant to hold it and then only under conditions that increase the reluctance.”\nPerfect description of the Bene Gesserit!\n“Are you well, Dar?” It was Bellonda’s voice from the tube door beside Odrade. “You look... strange.”\n“I just thought of something to do. You getting off?”\nBellonda stared at her as they exchanged places. The tube-field caught Odrade and whisked her away from that\nquestioning gaze.\nOdrade entered the workroom and saw her table piled with things her aides thought only she could resolve.\nPolitics, she recalled as she sat at her table and prepared to deal with responsibilities. Tam and Bell had heard her clearly the other day but they had only the vaguest idea of what they would be asked to support. They were worried and increasingly watchful. As they should be.\nAlmost any subject had political elements, she thought. As emotions were whipped up, political forces came more and more into the foreground. This put //e/ to that old nonsense about “separation of church and state.” Nothing more susceptible to emotional heat than religion.\nNo wonder we distrust emotions.\nNot all emotions, of course. Only the ones you could not escape in moments of necessity: love, hate. Let in a little anger sometimes but keep it on a short leash. That was the Sisterhood’s belief. Utter nonsense!\nThe Tyrant’s Golden Path made their mistake no longer tolerable. The Golden Path left the Bene Gesserit in a perpetual backwater. You could not minister to Infinity!\nBell’s recurrent question had no answer. “What did he really want us to do?” /nto what actions was he manipulating us? (As we manipulate others!)\nWhy look for meaning where there is none? Would you follow a path you knew led nowhere?\nGolden Path! A track laid down in one imagination. /nfinity is nowhere! And the finite mind balked. Here was where Mentats found mutable projections, always producing more questions than answers. It was the empty grail of those who, noses close to an endless circle, looked for “the one answer to all things.”\nLooking for their own kind of god.\nShe found it hard to censure them. The mind recoiled in the face of infinity. The Void! Alchemists of any age were like\nrag pickers bent over their bundles, saying: “There must be order in here somewhere. If | keep on, I’m sure to find it.”\nAnd all the time, the only order was the order they themselves created.\nAhhh, Tyrant! You droll fellow. You saw it. You said: “I will create order for you to follow. Here is the path. See it? No! Don’t look over there. That is the way of the Emperor- Without-Clothes (a nakedness apparent only to children and the insane). Keep your attention where I direct it. This is my Golden Path. Isn't that a pretty name? It’s all there is and all there ever will be.”\nTyrant, you were another clown. Pointing us into endless recycling of cells from that lost and lonely ball of dirt in our common past.\nYou knew the human universe could never be more than communities and weak glue binding us when we Scattered. A common birth tradition so far away in our past that pictures of it carried by descendants are mostly distorted. Reverend Mothers carry the original, but we cannot force it onto unwilling people. You see, Tyrant? We heard you: “Let them come asking for it! Then, and only then...”\nAnd that was why you preserved us, you Atreides bastard! That’s why I must get to work.\nDespite the peril to her sense of humanity, she knew she would continue to insinuate herself into the ways of Honored Matres. / must think as they think.\nThe hunters’ problem: predator and prey shared it. Not quite needle-in-the-haystack. More a question of tracking across a terrain littered with the familiar and the unfamiliar. Bene Gesserit deceptions insured that the familiar would cause Honored Matres at least as much difficulty as the unfamiliar.\nBut what have they done for us?\nInterplanetary communication worked for the hunted. Limited by economics for millennia. Not much of it except among Important People and Traders. Important meant what\nit had always meant: rich, powerful; bankers, officials, couriers. Military. “Important” labeled many categories— negotiators, entertainers, medical personnel, skilled technicians, spies, and other specialists. It was not much different in kind from the days of the Master Masons on Old Terra. Mainly a difference in numbers, quality and sophistication. Boundaries were transparent to some as they had always been.\nShe felt it important to review this occasionally, looking for flaws.\nThe great mass of planet-bound humanity spoke of “the silence of space,” meaning they could not afford the cost of such travel or communication. Most people knew the news they received across this barrier was managed for special interests. It had always been that way.\nOn a planet, terrain and avoiding telltale radiation dictated the communications systems used: tubes, messengers, light-lines, nerve riders and many permutations. Secrecy and encryption were important, not only between planets but on them.\nOdrade saw it as a system Honored Matres could tap if they found an entry point. Hunters had to begin by deciphering the system, but then: Where did a trail to Chapterhouse originate?\nUntrackable no-ships, Ixian machines, and Guild Navigators—all contributed to the blanket of silence between planets except for the privileged few. Give hunters no starting points!\nIt came as a Surprise then when an aging Reverend Mother from a Bene Gesserit punishment planet appeared at Mother Superior’s workroom shortly before the lunch break. Archives identified her: Name: Dortujla. Sent to special perdition years ago for an unforgivable infraction. Memory said it had been a love affair of some kind. Odrade did not ask for details. Some of them were displayed anyway. (Bellonda interfering again!) Emotional upheaval at\nthe time of Dortujla’s banishment, Odrade noted. Futile attempts by the lover to prevent separation.\nOdrade recalled gossip about Dortujla’s disgrace. “The Jessica crime!” Much valuable information arrived via gossip. Where the devil had Dortujla been posted? Never mind. Not important at the moment. More important: Why is she here? Why did she dare a trip that might lead the hunters to us?\nOdrade asked Streggi when she announced the arrival. Streggi did not know. “She says what she must reveal is for your ears alone, Mother Superior.”\n“Alone?” Odrade almost chuckled, considering the constant monitoring (surveillance was a better term) of her every action. “This Dortujla has not said why she is here?”\n“The ones who told me to interrupt you, Mother Superior, said they thought you should see her.”\nOdrade pursed her lips. The fact that the banished Reverend Mother had penetrated this far aroused Odrade’s curiosity. A persistent Reverend Mother could cross ordinary barriers but these barriers were not ordinary. Dortujla’s reason for coming already had been told. Others had heard and passed her. It was apparent that Dortujla had not relied on Bene Gesserit wiles to persuade her Sisters. That would have brought immediate rejection. No time for such nonsense! So she had observed the chain of command. Her action spoke of careful assessment, a message within whatever message she brought.\n“Bring her.”\nDortujla had aged smoothly on her backwater planet. She revealed her years mostly in shallow wrinkles around her mouth. The hood of her robe concealed her hair but the eyes peering from beneath it were bright", "ujla has not said why she is here?”\n“The ones who told me to interrupt you, Mother Superior, said they thought you should see her.”\nOdrade pursed her lips.

She revealed her years mostly in shallow wrinkles around her mouth. The hood of her robe concealed her hair but the eyes peering from beneath it were bright and alert.\n“Why are you here?” Odrade’s tone said: “This had damned well better be important.”\nDortujla’s story was straightforward enough. She and three Reverend Mother associates had spoken to a band of\nFutars from the Scattering. Dortujla’s post had been searched out and asked to get a message to Chapterhouse. Dortujla had filtered the request through Truthsense, she said, reminding Mother Superior that even in backwaters there could be some talent. Judging the message truthful, her Sisters concurring, Dortujla had acted with speed, not unmindful of caution.\n“All due dispatch in our own no-ship,” was the way she put it. The ship, she said, was small, a smuggler type.\n“One person can operate it.”\nThe heart of the message was fascinating. Futars wished to ally themselves with Reverend Mothers in opposition to Honored Matres. How much of a force these Futars commanded was difficult to assess, Dortujla said.\n“They refused to say when | asked.”\nOdrade had assessed many stories about Futars. Killers of Honored Matres? There were reasons to believe it but Futar performance was confusing, especially in accounts from Gammu.\n“How many in this party?”\n“Sixteen Futars and four Handlers. That’s what they called themselves: Handlers. And they say Honored Matres have a dangerous weapon they can use only once.”\n“You only mentioned Futars. Who are these Handlers? And what is this about a secret weapon?”\n“| reserved mention of them. They appear to be human within variables noted from the Scattering: three men and a woman. As to the weapon, they would not say more.”\n“Appear to be human?”\n“There you have it, Mother Superior. | had the odd first impression they were Face Dancers. None of the criteria applied. Pheromones negative. Gestures, expressions— everything negative.”\n“Just that first impression?”\n“I cannot explain it.”\n“What of the Futars?”\n“They matched the descriptions. Human in outward appearance but with unmistakable ferocity. Cat family origins, | would judge.”\n“So others have said.”\n“They speak but it’s an abbreviated Galach. Word bursts, | thought them. ‘When eat?’ ‘You nice lady.’ ‘Want head scratch.’ ‘Sit here?’ They appeared immediately responsive to the Handlers but not fearful. Between Futars and Handlers | had the impression there was mutual respect and liking.”\n“Knowing the risks, why did you think this important enough to bring immediately?”\n“These are people from the Scattering. Their offer of alliance is an opening into places where Honored Matres originate.”\n“You asked about them, of course. And about conditions in the Scattering.”\n“No answers.”\nThe fact, simply stated. One could not sneer at the banished Sister no matter how much of a cloud she carried over her past. More questions were indicated. Odrade asked them, observing closely as answers came, watching the old mouth like a withered fruit opening purple and closing pink.\nSomething in Dortujla’s service, the long years of penitence perhaps, had gentled her but left the core of Bene Gesserit toughness untouched. She spoke with natural hesitancy. Her gestures were softly fluid. She looked at Odrade with kindness. (There was the flaw her Sisters condemned: Bene Gesserit cynicism held at bay.)\nDortujla interested Odrade. Sister to Sister, she spoke, a strong and well-composed mind behind her words. A mind toughened by adversity in the years at a punishment post. Doing what she could now to make up for that lapse of her youth. No attempt to appear some time-server not up on current affairs. An account pared to essentials. Let it be known that she had as full as possible an awareness of\nnecessities. Bowed to Mother Superior’s decisions and caution about the dangerous visit but still felt that “you should have this information.”\n“I’m convinced it’s not a trap.”\nDortujla’s demeanor was above reproach. Direct gaze, eyes and face held in proper composure but no attempts at concealment. A Sister could read through this mask for a proper assessment. Dortujla acted from a sense of urgency. She had been a fool once but she no longer was a fool.\nWhat was the name of her punishment planet?\nThe worktable’s projector produced it: Buzzell.\nThat name brought an alertness to Odrade. Buzzell! Her fingers danced in the console, confirming memories. Buzzell: mostly ocean. Cold. Very cold. Hardscrabble islands, none bigger than a large no-ship. The Bene Gesserit once had considered Buzzell a punishment. Object lesson: “Careful, girl, or you’ll be sent to Buzzell.” Odrade recalled the other key then: soostones. Buzzell was a place where they had naturalized the monoped sea creature, Cholister, whose abraded carapace produced marvelous tumors, one of the most valued jewels in the universe.\nSoostones.\nDortujla was wearing one of the things just visible above the tuck of her neckline. The workroom light turned it an elegant blend of deeply glowing sea-green and mauve. It was larger than a human eyeball, flaunted there like a declaration of wealth. They probably thought little of such decorations on Buzzell. Pick them up on the beaches.\nSoostones. That was significant. By Bene Gesserit design, Dortujla had frequent dealings with smugglers. (Witness her possession of that no-ship.) This must be addressed with care. No matter the Sister-to-Sister discussion, it was still Mother Superior and Reverend Mother from a punishment planet.\nSmuggling. A major crime to Honored Matres and others who had not faced the fact of unenforceable laws. Foldspace\nhad not changed it for smuggling, just made small intrusions easier if anything. Tiny no-ships. How small could you make one of them? A gap in Odrade’s knowledge. Archives corrected it: “Diameter, meters 140.”\nSmall enough, then. Soostones were a cargo with natural attraction. Foldspace was a critical economic barrier: How valuable a cargo compared to size and mass? You could spend many Solars moving massive stuff. Soostones— magnetic to smugglers. They had special interest to Honored Matres as well. Simple economics? Always a big market. As attractive to smugglers as melange now that the Guild was being so free with it. The Guild had always stockpiled with generations of spice in scattered storage and (doubtless) many hidden backups.\nThey think they can buy immunity from Honored Matres! But that offered something she sensed might be turned to advantage. In their wild anger, Honored Matres had destroyed Dune, only known natural source of melange. Still unthinking of consequences (odd, that), they had eliminated the Tleilaxu, whose axlotl tanks had flooded the Old Empire with spice.\nAnd we have creatures capable of recreating Dune. We also may have the only living Tleilaxu Master. Locked in Scytale’s mind—the way to turn axlotl tanks into a melange cornucopia. If we can get him to reveal it.\nThe immediate problem was Dortujla. The woman conveyed her ideas with a conciseness that did her credit. Handlers and their Futars, she said, were disturbed by something they would not reveal. Dortujla had been wise not to attempt Bene Gesserit persuasives. No telling how people from the Scattering might react. But what disturbed them?\n“Some threat other than Honored Matres,” Dortujla suggested. She would not venture more but the possibility was there and had to be considered.\n“The essential thing is that they say they want an alliance,” Odrade said.\n“Common cause for a common problem,” was the way they had put it. Despite Truthsense, Dortujla advised only a cautious exploration of the offer.\nWhy go to Buzzell at all? Because Honored Matres had missed Buzzell or judged it insignificant in their angry sweeps?\n“Not likely,” Dortujla said.\nOdrade agreed. Dortujla, no matter how grubby her Original posting, now commanded a valuable property and, much more important, she was a Reverend Mother with a no-ship to take her to Mother Superior. She knew the location of Chapterhouse. Useless to the hunters, of course. They knew a Reverend Mother would kill herself before betraying that secret.\nProblems compounded problems. But first, some Sisterly Sharing. Dortujla was sure to make a correct interpretation of Mother Superior’s motives. Odrade shifted the conversation into personal matters.\nIt went well. Dortujla was clearly amused but willing to talk.\nReverend Mothers on lonely posts tended to have what Sisters called “other interests.” An earlier age had called them hobbies but attention devoted to interests often was extreme. Odrade thought most interests boring but found it significant that Dortujla called hers a hobby. She collected old coins, did she?\n“What kind?”\n“I have two early Greek in silver and a perfect gold obol.”\n“Authentic?”\n“They're real.” Meaning she had done a self-scan of Other Memory to authenticate them. Fascinating. She exercised her abilities in a strengthening way, even with her hobby. Inner history and exterior coincided.\n“This is all very interesting, Mother Superior,” Dortujla said finally. “I appreciate your reassurance that we are still Sisters and find your interest in ancient paintings a parallel hobby. But we both know why I risked coming here.”\n“The smugglers.”\n“Of course. Honored Matres cannot have overlooked my presence on Buzzell. Smugglers will sell to the high bidders. We must assume they have profited from their valuable knowledge about Buzzell, the soostones, and a resident Reverend Mother with attendants. And we must not forget that Handlers found me.”\nDamn! Odrade thought. Dortujla is the kind of advisor | like to have near me. | wonder how many more such buried treasures are out there, tucked away for mean motives? Why do we so often shunt our talented ones aside? It’s an ancient weakness the Sisterhood has not exorcised.\n“I think we have learned something valuable about Honored Matres,” Dortujla said.\nThere was no need to nod agreement. This was the core of what had brought Dortujla to Chapterhouse. The ravening hunters had come swarming into the Old Empire, killing and burning wherever they suspected the presence of Bene Gesserit establishments. But the hunters had not touched Buzzell even though its location must be known.\n“Why?” Odrade asked, voicing what was in their minds.\n“Never damage your own nest,” Dortujla said.\n“You think they’re already on Buzzell?”\n“Not yet.”\n“But you believe"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_7ab167f275b5343962850e223e06f19a46f83c48c36a628e9a28c02700c738a7_v2"}
