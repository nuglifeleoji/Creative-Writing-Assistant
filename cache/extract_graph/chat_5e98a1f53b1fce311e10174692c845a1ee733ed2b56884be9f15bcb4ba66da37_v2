Not as good as old Gurney Halleck would do it but good enough to prepare for a little bedsport.”\n“You find this amusing?” she asked.\n“Amusing? No, but | am reminded of Gurney. Tell me, Bashar, have you brought him back from the dead, too?”\n“Not to my knowledge,” Teg said.\n“Ahhhh, there was a singing man!” Duncan said. “He could be killing you while he sang and never miss a note.”\nHer manner still icy, Lucilla said: “We of the Bene Gesserit have learned to avoid music. It evokes too many confusing emotions. Memory-emotions, of course.”\nIt was meant to awe him with a reminder of all those Other Memories and the Bene Gesserit powers these implied but Duncan only laughed louder.\n“What a shame that is,” he said. “You miss so much of life.” And he began humming an old Halleck refrain:\n“Review friends, troops long past review...”\nBut his mind whirled elsewhere with the rich new flavor of these reborn moments and once more he felt the eager touch of something powerful that remained buried within him. Whatever it was, it was violent and it concerned Lucilla, the Imprinter. In imagination, he saw her dead and her body awash in blood.\nPeople always want something more than immediate joy or that deeper sense called happiness. This is one of the secrets by which we shape the fulfillment of our designs. The something more assumes amplified power with people who cannot give it a name or who (most often the case) do not even suspect its existence. Most people only react unconsciously to such hidden forces. Thus, we have only to call a calculated something more into existence, define it and give it shape, then people will follow.\n—LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF THE BENE GESSERIT\nW ith a silent Waff about twenty paces ahead of them, Odrade and Sheeana walked down a weed-fringed road beside a spice-storage yard. All of them wore new desert robes and glistening stillsuits. The gray nulplaz fence that defined the yard beside them held bits of grass and cottony seedpods in its meshes. Looking at the seedpods, Odrade thought of them as life trying to break through a human intervention.\nBehind them, the blocky buildings that had arisen around Dar-es-Balat baked in the sunlight of early afternoon. Hot dry air burned her throat when she inhaled too quickly. Odrade felt dizzy and at war within herself. Thirst nagged at her. She walked as though balanced on the edge of a precipice. The situation she had created at Taraza’s command might explode momentarily.\nHow fragile it is!\nThree forces balanced, not really supporting each other but joined by motives that could shift in an instant and topple the whole alliance. The military people sent by Taraza did not reassure Odrade. Where was Teg? Where was Burzmali? For that matter, where was the ghola? He should be here by now. Why had she been ordered to delay matters?\nToday’s venture would certainly delay matters! Although it had Taraza’s blessing, Odrade thought this excursion into the desert of the worms might be a permanent delay. And there was Waff. If he survived, would there be any pieces for him to pick up?\nDespite the healing applications of the Sisterhood’s best quicknit amplifiers, Waff said his arms still ached where Odrade had broken them. He was not complaining, merely providing information. He appeared to accept their fragile alliance, even the modifications that incorporated the Rakian priestly cabal. No doubt he was reassured that one of his own Face Dancers occupied the High Priest’s bench in the guise of Tuek. Waff spoke forcefully when he demanded his “breeding mothers” from the Bene Gesserit and, consequently, withheld his part of their bargain.\n“Only a small delay while the Sisterhood reviews the new agreement,” Odrade explained. “Meanwhile. . .”\nToday was “meanwhile.”\nOdrade put aside her misgivings and began to enter the mood of this venture. Waff’s behavior fascinated her, especially his reaction on meeting Sheeana: quite plainly fearful and more than a little in awe.\nThe minion of his Prophet.\nOdrade glanced sideways at the girl walking dutifully beside her. There was the real leverage for shaping these events into the Bene Gesserit design.\nThe Sisterhood’s breakthrough into the reality behind Tleilaxu behavior excited Odrade. Waff’s fanatic “true faith” gained shape with each new response from him. She felt fortunate just to be here studying a Tleilaxu Master in a religious setting. The very grit under Waff’s feet ignited behavior that she had been trained to identify.\nWe should have guessed, Odrade thought. The manipulations of our own Missionaria Protectiva should have told us how the Tleilaxu did it: keeping themselves to\nthemselves, blocking off every intrusion for all of those plodding millennia.\nThey did not appear to have copied the Bene Gesserit structure. And what other force could do such a thing? It was a religion. The Great Belief!\nUnless the Tleilaxu are using their ghola system as a kind of immortality.\nTaraza could be right. Reincarnated Tleilaxu Masters would not be like Reverend Mothers—no Other Memories, only personal memories. But prolonged!\nFascinating!\nOdrade looked ahead at Waff’s back. Plodding. It appeared to come naturally to him. She recalled that he called Sheeana “Alyama.” Another confirming linguistic insight into Waff’s Great Belief. It meant “Blessed One.” The Tleilaxu had kept an ancient language not only alive but unchanged.\nDid Waff not know that only powerful forces such as religions did that?\nWe have the roots of your obsession in our grasp, Waff! It is not unlike some that we have created. We know how to manipulate such things for our own purposes.\nTaraza’s communication burned in Odrade’s awareness: “The Tleilaxu plan is transparent: Ascendancy. The human universe must be made into a Tleilaxu universe. They could not hope to achieve such a goal without help from the Scattering. Ergo.”\nThe Mother Superior’s reasoning could not be denied. Even the opposition within that deep schism that threatened to shatter the Sisterhood agreed. But the thought of those human masses in the Scattering, their numbers exploding exponentially, produced a lonely sense of desperation in Odrade.\nWe are so few compared to them.\nSheeana stooped and picked up a pebble. She looked at it a moment and then threw it at the fence beside them. The\npebble sailed through the meshes without touching them.\nOdrade took a firmer grip on herself. The sounds of their footsteps on the blown sand that drifted across this little- used roadway seemed suddenly over-loud. The spindly causeway leading out over the Dar-es-Balat ring-qanat and moat lay no more than two hundred paces ahead at the end of this narrow road.\nSheeana spoke: “I am doing this because you ordered it, Mother. But I still don’t know why.”\nBecause this is the crucible where we test Waff and, through him, reshape the Tleilaxu!\n“It is a demonstration,” Odrade said.\nThat was true. It was not the whole truth, but it served. Sheeana walked head down, gaze intent on where she placed each step. Was this how she always approached her\nShaitan? Odrade wondered. Thoughtful and remote?\nOdrade heard a faint thwocking sound high up behind her. The watchful ornithopters were arriving. They would keep their distance, but many eyes would observe this demonstration.\n“I will dance,” Sheeana said. “That usually calls a big one.”\nOdrade felt her heartbeat quicken. Would the “big one” continue to obey Sheeana despite the presence of two companions?\nThis is suicidal madness!\nBut it had to be done: Taraza’s orders.\nOdrade glanced at the fenced spice yard beside them. The place appeared oddly familiar. More than déjà vu. Inner certainty informed by Other Memories told her this place remained virtually unchanged from ancient times. The design of the spice silos in the yard was as old as Rakis: oval tanks on tall legs, metal and plaz insects waiting stilt-legged to leap upon their prey. She suspected an unconscious message from the original designers: Melange is both boon and bane.\nBeneath the silos, a sandy wasteland where no growth was permitted spread out beside mud-walled buildings, an amoeba arm of Dar-es-Balat reaching almost to the qanat edge. The Tyrant’s long-hidden no-globe had produced a teeming religious community that hid most of its activities behind windowless walls and underground.\nThe secret working of our unconscious desires!\nOnce more, Sheeana spoke: “Tuek is different.”\nOdrade saw Waff’s head lift sharply. He had heard. He would be thinking: Can we conceal things from the Prophet’s messenger?\nToo many people already knew that a Face Dancer masqueraded as Tuek, Odrade thought. The priestly cabal, of course, believed they were giving the Tleilaxu enough netting in which to snare not only the Bene Tleilax but the Sisterhood as well.\nOdrade smelled the biting odors of chemicals that had been used to kill wild growth in the spice storage yard. The odors forced her attention back to necessities. She did not dare indulge in mental wanderings out here! It would be so easy for the Sisterhood to become caught in its own trap.\nSheeana stumbled and emitted a small cry, more irritation than pain. Waff turned his head sharply and looked at Sheeana before returning his attention to the roadway. The child had merely stumbled on a break in the road surface, he saw. Drifted sand concealed places where the roadway had been cracked. The faery structure of the Causeway ahead of him appeared sound, however. Not substantial enough to support one of the Prophet’s descendants, but more than enough for a supplicant human to cross it into the desert.\nWaff thought of himself chiefly as a supplicant.\n| come as a beggar into the land of thy messenger, God.\nHe had his suspicions about Odrade. The Reverend Mother had brought him here to drain him of his knowledge before killing him. With God’s help, | may surprise her yet.\nHe knew his body was proof against an Ixian Probe, although she obviously did not have such a cumbersome device on her person. But it was the strength of his own will and confidence in God’s grace that reassured Waff.\nAnd what if the hand they hold out to us is held out in sincerity?\nThat, too, would be God’s doing.\nAlliance with the Bene Gesserit, firm control of Rakis: What a dream that was! The Shariat ascendant at last and the Bene Gesserit as missionaries.\nWhen Sheeana again missed her footing and uttered another small sound of complaint, Odrade said: “Don’t favor yourself, child!”\nOdrade saw Waff’s shoulders stiffen. He did not like that peremptory manner with his “Blessed One.” There was backbone in the little man. Odrade recognized it as the strength of fanatic\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5e98a1f53b1fce311e10174692c845a1ee733ed2b56884be9f15bcb4ba66da37_v2"}
