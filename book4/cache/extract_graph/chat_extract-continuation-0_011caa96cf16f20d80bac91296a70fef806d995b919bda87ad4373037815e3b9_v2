\n　　父亲挖坑就象母亲纳鞋底，行行道道，疏密有致，远看如同工艺美术家精心设计的图案。少平耐着性子，尽量把籽种不偏不露点在土坑中间，再补一个不轻不重的脚印。终于休息了。父亲蹲在地上抽烟，少平就凑到他跟前，也学着他哥的样，卷了一支旱烟棒。 \n　　他用父亲的打火机点着烟抽了几口，然后才鼓起勇气，和父亲谈起了他走黄原的打算。 \n　　孙玉厚老汉惊得目瞪口呆。 \n　　他“吱吱”地用劲吸着烟锅。思谋了好一阵，才说：“你还小哩！出那么远的门，人生地不熟，我和你妈怎能放心？你怎猛然想起要出门哩？” \n　　少平一时难以给父亲说清楚自己的心思。 \n　　“我呆在家里不痛快，想出去跑一跑……” \n　　父亲低倾下头，手指头抠着脚指头，说：“我能想来哩。你从学校回来劳了动，心里难过。没办法啊！世事就是这样。爸爸看见你一天灰土满面的，心里也难过……不过，而今政策宽了，劳动虽说熬苦一些，但吃饭不要再受熬煎。你刚开始出山，爸爸晓得你不习惯。过上一两年，也就习惯了。外面的世界不是咱们的，你出去，还不是要受苦？再说，有个什么事，也没有人帮扶你……” \n　　“爸爸，这你不要操心。我二十几的人了。自个儿能管得了自个儿，你就让我出上几天门！你年轻时不是也吆牲灵跑过山西吗。我不到外面闯荡一回，一辈子心里平不下来，你就让我走吧！咱们家现在有你和我哥，这点土地你们能耕务过来。我出去，也不是去瞎逛！我也长两只手，兴许还能给家里赚几个活钱，爸爸，你放心……” \n　　孙少平几乎要哭了。 \n　　父亲看出儿子为他的行动经过了长时间的准备，显然很难再说服他放弃这种冒险念头，他只好犹豫地说：“那这事你要和你哥商量哩！唉，我老了，世事要看你们闹。不过，爸爸生怕你们有个闪失……” \n　　少平严肃而感动地对父亲点了点头。 \n　　玉米地半后晌就种完了——种完就回家，不必象生产队，只要不磨到天黑，就收不了工。 \n　　父子俩回家后，离吃晚饭还有很长一段时间。于是他们又收拾了一下，赶到后村头烧砖窑那里给少安两口子帮忙。孙少安夫妇正忙得不可开交。第三窑砖正烧到紧要关头，少安既要加炭漏灰，还要刁空抢着打下一窑的土坯，还不到热天，他就光穿了件小布褂，脸熏得如同\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
