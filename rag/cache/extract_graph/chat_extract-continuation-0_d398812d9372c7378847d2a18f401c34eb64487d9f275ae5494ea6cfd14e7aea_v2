She felt her spirit go out to them: they had a place to hide; she had none.\n“M’Lady, the wind comes!”\nShe turned, saw the ghola calling to her outside the upper entrance to the sietch. Fremen fears gripped her. Clean death and the body’s water claimed for the tribe, these she understood. But... something brought back from death...\nWindblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the storm had taken ona tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She\nhesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert’s transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs.\nThe storm out there had become a universal thing for her —all the animals hiding from it... nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds: blown sand scraping along rock, a wind-surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill—then! somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths.\nIt was only a moment as her life measured time, but in that moment she felt this planet being swept away—cosmic dust, part of other waves.\n“We must hurry,” the ghola said from right beside her.\nShe sensed fear in him then, concern for her safety.\n“It'll shred the flesh from your bones,” he said, as though he needed to explain such a storm to her.\nHer fear of him dispelled by his obvious concern, Chani allowed the ghola to help her up the rock stairway to the sietch. They entered the twisting baffle which protected the entrance. Attendants opened the moisture seals, closed them behind.\nSietch odors assaulted her nostrils. The place was a ferment of nasal memories—the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work... and through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere.\nShe took a deep breath. “Home.”\nThe ghola took his hand from her arm, stood aside, a patient figure now, almost as though turned off when not in use. Yet... he watched.\nChani hesitated in the entrance chamber, puzzled by something she could not name. This was truly her home. As a child, she’d hunted scorpions here by glowglobe light. Something was changed, though...\n“Shouldn’t you be going to your quarters, m’Lady?” the ghola asked.\nAs though ignited by his words, a rippling birth constriction seized her abdomen. She fought against revealing it.\n“M’Lady?” the ghola said.\n“Why is Paul afraid for me to bear our children?” she asked.\n“It is a natural thing to fear for your safety,” the ghola said.\nShe put a hand to her cheek where the sand had reddened it. “And he doesn’t fear for the children?”\n“M’Lady, he cannot think of a child without remembering that your firstborn was slain by the Sardaukar.”\nShe studied the ghola—flat face, unreadable mechanical eyes. Was he truly Duncan Idaho, this creature? Was he friend to anyone? Had he spoken truthfully now?\n“You should be with the medics,” the ghola said.\nAgain, she heard the fear for her safety in his voice. She felt abruptly that her mind lay undefended, ready to be invaded by shocking perceptions.\n“Hayt, I’m afraid,” she whispered. “Where is my Usul?”\n“Affairs of state detain him,” the ghola said.\nShe nodded, thinking of the government apparatus which had accompanied them in a great flight of ornithopters. Abruptly, she realized what puzzled her about the sietch: outworld odors. The clerks and aides had brought their own perfumes into this environment, aromas of diet and clothing, of exotic toiletries. They were an undercurrent of odors here.\nChani shook herself, concealing an urge to bitter laughter. Even the smells changed in Muad’Dib’s presence!\n“There were pressing matters which he could not defer,” the ghola said, misreading her hesitation.\n“Yes... yes, | understand. | came with that swarm, too.”\nRecalling the flight from Arrakeen, she admitted to herself now that she had not expected to survive it. Paul had insisted on piloting his own ‘thopter. Eyeless, he had guided the machine here. After that experience, she knew nothing he did could surprise her.\nAnother pain fanned out through her abdomen.\nThe ghola saw her indrawn breath, the tightening of her cheeks, said: “Is it your time?”\n“Tr... yes, it is.”\n“You must not delay,” he said. He grasped her arm, hurried her down the hall.\nShe sensed panic in him, said: “There’s time.”\nHe seemed not to hear. “The Zensunni approach to birth,” he said, urging her even faster, “is to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension. Do not compete with what is happening. To compete is to prepare for failure. Do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything. This way, you achieve everything.”\nWhile he spoke, they reached the entrance to her quarters. He thrust her through the hangings, cried out: “Harah! Harah! It is Chani’s time. Summon the medics!”\nHis call brought attendants running. There was a great bustling of people in which Chani felt herself an isolated island of calm... until the next pain came.\nHayt, dismissed to the outer passage, took time to wonder at his own actions. He felt fixated at some point of time where all truths were only temporary. Panic lay beneath his actions, he realized. Panic centered not on the possibility that Chani might die, but that Paul should come to him afterward... filled with grief... his loved one... gone...gone...\nSomething cannot emerge from nothing, the ghola told himself. From what does this panic emerge?\nHe felt that his mentat faculties had been dulled, let out a long, shuddering breath. A psychic shadow passed over him.\nIn the emotional darkness of it, he felt himself waiting for some absolute sound—the snap of a branch in a jungle.\nA sigh shook him. Danger had passed without striking.\nSlowly, marshaling his powers, shedding bits of inhibition, he sank into mentat awareness. He forced it—not the best way—but somehow necessary. Ghost shadows moved within him in place of people. He was a trans-shipping station for every datum he had ever encountered. His being was inhabited by creatures of possibility. They passed in review to be compared, judged.\nPerspiration broke out on his forehead.\nThoughts with fuzzy edges feathered away into darkness —unknown. Infinite systems! A mentat could not function without realizing he worked in infinite systems. Fixed knowledge could not surround the infinite. Everywhere could not be brought into finite perspective. Instead, he must become the infinite—momentarily.\nIn one gestalten spasm, he had it, seeing Bijaz seated before him blazing from some inner fire.\nBijaz!\nThe dwarf had done something to him!\nHayt felt himself teetering on the lip of a deadly pit. He projected the mentat computation line forward, seeing what could develop out of his own actions.\n“A compulsion!” he gasped. “I’ve been rigged with a compulsion!”\nA blue-robed courier, passing as Hayt spoke, hesitated. “Did you say something, sirra?”\nNot looking at him, the ghola nodded. “I said everything.”\nThere was a man so wise, He jumped into A sandy place And burnt out both his eyes! And when he knew his eyes were gone, He offered no complaint. He summoned up a vision And made himself a saint.\n—CHILDREN’S VERSE FROM HISTORY OF MUAD’DIB\npau! stood in darkness outside the sietch. Oracular vision told him it was night, that moonlight silhouetted the Shrine atop Chin Rock high on his left. This was a memory- saturated place, his first sietch, where he and Chani...\nI must not think of Chani, he told himself.\nThe thinning cup of his vision told him of changes all around—a cluster of palms far down to the right, the black- silver line of a qanat carrying water through the dunes piled up by that morning’s storm.\nWater flowing in the desert! He recalled another kind of water flowing in a river of his birthworld, Caladan. He hadn’t realized then the treasure of such a flow, even the murky slithering in a qanat across a desert basin. Treasure.\nWith a delicate cough, an aide came up from behind.\nPaul held out his hands for a magnabord with a single sheet of metallic paper on it. He moved as sluggishly as the qanat’s water. The vision flowed, but he found himself increasingly reluctant to move with it.\n“Pardon, Sire,” the aide said. “The Semboule Treaty—your signature?”\n“I can read it!” Paul snapped. He scrawled “Atreides Imper.” in the proper place, returned the board, thrusting it\ndirectly into the aide’s outstretched hand, aware of the fear this inspired.\nThe man fled.\nPaul turned away. Ugly, barren land! He imagined it sun- soaked and monstrous with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools, blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals. But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places with vistas of storm-trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges.\nAll it required was water... and love.\nLife changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life— all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together!\nThey wouldn’t understand. In the desert, they were endlessly desert. Growing things performed no green ballet for them.\nHe clenched his fists at his sides, trying to halt the vision. He wanted to flee from his own mind. It was a beast come to devour him! Awareness lay in him, sodden, heavy with all the living it had sponged up, saturated with too many experiences.\nDesperately, Paul squeezed his thoughts outward.\nStars!\nAwareness turned over at the thought of all those stars above him—an infinite volume. A man must be half mad to imagine he could rule even a teardrop of that volume. He couldn’t begin to imagine the number of subjects his Imperium claimed.\nSubjects? Worshippers and enemies, more likely. Did any among them see beyond rigid beliefs? Where was one man who’d escaped the narrow destiny of his prejudices? Not\neven an Emperor escaped. He’d lived a take-everything life, tried to create a universe in his own image. But the exultant universe was breaking across him at last with its silent waves.\n| spit on Dune! he thought. / give it my moisture!\nThis myth he’d made out of intricate movements and imagination, out of moonlight and love, out of prayers older than Adam, and gray cliffs and crimson shadows, laments and rivers of martyrs—what had it come to at last?
