Appointed by Emperor Cao Rui, he played a crucial role in leading the Wei army against the Shu troops, particularly during a time of significant military conflict. His strategic involvement included collaborating with fellow general Guo Huai to devise military strategies aimed at countering the Shu forces, which were led by the renowned strategist Zhuge Liang.\n\nDespite his initial skepticism regarding the threat posed by the Shu troops, Cao Zhen's complacency ultimately contributed to the Wei army's challenges on the battlefield. He faced considerable stress from the ongoing military engagements, which led to his declining health.
