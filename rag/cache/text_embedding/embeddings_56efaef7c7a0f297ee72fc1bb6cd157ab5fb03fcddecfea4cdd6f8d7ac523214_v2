The ones we send to him must be chosen with extreme care. He must never suspect that he is part of our bait.\nHis elfin features composed, Waff stared back at her.\nHow bland he looked, Taraza thought. But he could be trapped! An alliance between Sisterhood and Tleilaxu offered new attractions. But on our terms!\n“Until Rakis,” she said.\nWhat social inheritances went outward with the Scattering? We know those times intimately. We know both the mental and physical settings. The Lost Ones took with them a consciousness confined mostly to manpower and hardware. There was a desperate need for room to expand driven by the myth of Freedom. Most had not learned the deeper lesson of the Tyrant, that violence builds its own limits. The Scattering was wild and random movement interpreted as growth (expansion). It was goaded by a profound fear (often unconscious) of stagnation and death.\n—THE SCATTERING: BENE GESSERIT ANALYSIS (ARCHIVES)\ndrade lay full length on her side along the ledge of the\nbow window, her cheek lightly touching the warm plaz through which she could see the Great Square of Keen. Her back was supported by a red cushion, which smelled of melange as did many things here on Rakis. Behind her lay three rooms, small but efficient and well removed from both Temple and Bene Gesserit Keep. This removal had been a requirement of the Sisterhood’s agreement with the priests.\n“Sheeana must be guarded more securely,” Odrade had insisted.\n“She cannot become the ward of only the Sisterhood!” Tuek had objected.\n“Nor of the priests,” Odrade countered.\nSix stories below Odrade’s bow window vantage, an enormous bazaar spread out in loosely organized confusion, almost filling the Great Square. The silvered yellow light of a lowering sun washed the scene with brilliance, picking out the bright colors of canopies, drawing long shadows across the uneven ground. There was a dusty radiance about the light where scattered clumps of people milled about patched umbrellas and the jumbled alignments of wares.\nThe Great Square was not actually square. It stretched out around the bazaar a full kilometer across from Odrade’s window and easily twice that distance to the left and right— a giant rectangle of packed earth and old stones, which had been churned into bitter dust by daytime shoppers braving the heat in hopes of gaining a bargain then.\nAs evening advanced, a different sense of activity unfolded beneath Odrade—more people arriving, a quickening and more frenetic pulse to the movement.\nOdrade tipped her head to peer down sharply at the ground near her building. Some of the merchants directly beneath her window had wandered off to their nearby quarters. They would return soon, after a meal and short siesta, ready to make full use of those more valuable hours when people in the open could breathe air that did not burn their throats.\nSheeana was overdue, Odrade noted. The priests dared not delay much longer. They would be working frantically now, firing questions at Sheeana, admonishing her to remember that she was God’s own emissary to His Church. Reminding Sheeana of many contrived allegiances that Odrade would have to ferret out and make humorous before dispatching such trivia into proper perspective.\nOdrade arched her back and went through a silent minute of tiny exercises to relieve tensions. She admitted to a certain sympathy for Sheeana. The girl’s thoughts would be chaos right now. Sheeana knew little or nothing about what to expect once she came fully under a Reverend Mother’s tutelage. There was little doubt that the young mind was cluttered with myths and other misinformation.\nAs my mind was, Odrade thought.\nShe could not avoid remembrance at a moment such as this. Her immediate task was clear: exorcism, not only for Sheeana but for herself.\nShe thought the haunting thoughts of a Reverend Mother in her memories: Odrade, age five, the comfortable house\non Gammu. The road outside the house is lined with what pass for middle-echelon mansions in the planet’s seacoast cities—low one-story buildings on wide avenues. The houses reach far down to an outcurving sea frontage where they are much wider than along the avenues. Only on the sea side do they become more expansive and less jealous of every square meter.\nOdrade’s Bene Gesserit-honed memory rolled through that faraway house, its occupants, the avenue, the playmates. She felt the tightness in her breast that told her such memories were attached to later events.\nThe Bene Gesserit creche on Al Dhanab’s artificial world, one of the original Sisterhood safe planets. (Later, she learned that the Bene Gesserit once considered making the entire planet into a no-chamber. Energy requirements defeated this plan.)\nThe crèche was a cascade of variety to a child from Gammu’s comforts and friendships. Bene Gesserit education included intense physical training. There were regular admonishments that she could not hope to become a Reverend Mother without passage through much pain and frequent periods of seemingly hopeless muscular exercises.\nSome of her companions failed at this stage. They left to become nurses, servants, laborers, casual breeders. They filled niches of necessity wherever the Sisterhood required them. There were times when Odrade felt longingly that this failure might not be a bad life—fewer responsibilities, lesser goals. That had been before she emerged from Primary Training.\n| thought of it as emerging, coming through victorious. | came out the other side.\nOnly to find herself immersed in new and harsher demands.\nOdrade sat up on her Rakian window ledge and pushed her cushion aside. She turned her back on the bazaar. It was\nbecoming noisier out there. Damned priests! They were stretching delay to its absolute limits!\nI must think about my own childhood because that will help me with Sheeana, she thought. Immediately, she sneered at her own weakness. Another excuse!\nIt took some postulants at least fifty years to become Reverend Mothers. This was ground into them during Secondary Training: a lesson of patience. Odrade showed an early penchant for deep study. There was consideration that she might become one of the Bene Gesserit Mentats and probably an Archivist. This idea was dropped on the discovery that her talents lay in a more profitable direction. She was aimed at more sensitive duties in Chapter House.\nSecurity.\nThat wild talent among the Atreides often had this employment. Care with details, that was Odrade’s hallmark. She knew her sisters could predict some of her actions simply from their deep knowledge of her. Taraza did it regularly. Odrade had overheard the explanation from Taraza’s own lips:\n“Odrade’s persona is exquisitely reflected in her performance of duties.”\nThere was a joke in Chapter House: “Where does Odrade go when she’s off duty? She goes to work.”\nChapter House imposed little need to adopt the covering masks that a Reverend Mother used automatically on the Outside. She might show emotions momentarily, deal openly with mistakes of her own and of others, feel sad or bitter or even, sometimes, happy. Men were available—not for breeding, but for occasional solace. All such Bene Gesserit Chapter House males were quite charming and a few were even sincere in their charm. These few, of course, were much in demand.\nEmotions.\nRecognition twisted through Odrade’s mind.\nSo I come to it as | always do.\nOdrade felt the warm evening sunlight of Rakis on her back. She knew where her body sat, but her mind opened itself to the coming encounter with Sheeana.\nLove!\nIt would be so easy and so dangerous.\nIn this moment, she envied the Station Mothers, the ones allowed to live out a lifetime with a mated breeding partner. Miles Teg came from such a union. Other Memories told her how it had been for the Lady Jessica and her Duke. Even Muad’Dib had chosen that form of mating.\nIt is not for me.\nOdrade admitted to a bitter jealousy that she had not been permitted such a life. What were the compensations of the life into which she had been guided?\n“A life without love can be devoted more intensely to the Sisterhood. We provide our own forms of support to the initiated. Do not worry about sexual enjoyment. That is available whenever you feel the need.”\nWith charming men!\nSince the days of the Lady Jessica, through the Tyrant’s times and beyond, many things had changed .. . including the Bene Gesserit. Every Reverend Mother knew it.\nA deep sigh shuddered through Odrade. She glanced back over her shoulder at the bazaar. Still no sign of Sheeana.\nI must not love this child!\nIt was done. Odrade knew she had played out the mnemonic game in its required Bene Gesserit form. She swiveled her body and sat cross-legged on the ledge. It was a commanding view of the bazaar and over the rooftops of the city and its basin. Those few remnant hills out there south of here were, she knew, the last of what had been the Shield Wall of Dune, the high ramparts of basement rock breached by Muad’Dib and his sandworm-mounted legions.\nHeat danced from the ground beyond the qanat and canal that protected Keen from intrusions by the new worms. Odrade smiled softly. The priests found nothing strange in\nmoating their communities to keep their Divided God from intruding upon them.\nWe will worship you, God, but don’t bother us. This is our religion, our city. You see, we no longer call this place Arrakeen. Now, It’s Keen. The planet no longer is Dune or Arrakis. Now, It’s Rakis. Keep your distance, God. You are the past and the past is an embarrassment.\nOdrade stared at those distant hills dancing in the heat shimmer. Other Memories could superimpose the ancient landscape. She knew that past.\nIf the priests delay bringing Sheeana much longer I will punish them.\nHeat still filled the bazaar below her, held there by storage in the ground and the thick walls surrounding the Great Square. Temperature diffusion was amplified by the smoke of many small fires lighted in the surrounding buildings and among the tent-sheltered congeries of life scattered through the bazaar. It had been a hot day, well above thirty-eight degrees. This building, though, had been a Fish Speaker Center in the old days and was cooled by Ixian machinery with evaporation pools on the roof.\nWe will be comfortable here.\nAnd they would be as secure as Bene Gesserit protective measures could make them. Reverend Mothers walked those halls out there. The priests had their representatives in the building but none of those would intrude where Odrade did not want them. Sheeana would meet with them here on occasion but the occasions would be only as Odrade permitted.\nIt is happening, Odrade thought. Taraza’s plan moves ahead.\nFresh in Odrade’s mind was the latest communication from Chapter House. What that revealed about the Tleilaxu filled Odrade with excitement that she carefully dampened. This Waff, this Tleilaxu Master, would be a fascinating study.\nZensunni! And Sufi!\n“A ritual pattern frozen for millennia,” Taraza said.\nUnspoken in Taraza’s report was another message. Taraza is placing her complete confidence in me. Odrade felt strength flow into her from this awareness.\nSheeana is the fulcrum. We are the lever. Our strength will come from many sources.\nOdrade relaxed. She knew that Sheeana would not permit the priests to delay much longer. Odrade’s own", " did not want them. Sheeana would meet with them here on occasion but the occasions would be only as Odrade permitted.\nIt is happening, Odrade thought. Taraza’s plan moves ahead.\nFresh in Odrade’s mind was the latest communication from Chapter House. What that revealed about the Tleilaxu filled Odrade with excitement that she carefully dampened.

Our strength will come from many sources.\nOdrade relaxed. She knew that Sheeana would not permit the priests to delay much longer. Odrade’s own patience had suffered the assaults of anticipation. It would be worse for Sheeana.\nThey had become conspirators, Odrade and Sheeana. The first step. It was a marvelous game to Sheeana. She had been born and bred to distrust priests. What fun to have an ally at last!\nSome form of activity stirred the people directly below Odrade’s window. She peered downward, curious. Five naked men there had linked arms in a circle. Their robes and stillsuits lay in a pile at one side watched over by a dark- Skinned young girl in a long brown dress of spice fiber. Her hair was bound by a red rag.\nDancers!\nOdrade had seen many reports of this phenomenon but this was her first personal view of it since arriving. The onlookers included a trio of tall Priest Guardians in yellow helmets with high crests. The Guardians wore short robes that freed their legs for action, and each carried a metal- clad staff.\nAs the dancers circled, the watchful crowd grew predictably restive. Odrade knew the pattern. Soon, there would be a chanting outcry and a great melee. Heads would be cracked. Blood would flow. People would scream and run about. Eventually, it would all subside without official intervention. Some would go away weeping. Some would depart laughing. And the Priest Guardians would not interfere.\nThe pointless insanity of this dance and its consequences had fascinated the Bene Gesserit for centuries. Now it held Odrade’s rapt attention. The devolution of this ritual had been followed by the Missionaria Protectiva. Rakians called it “Dance Diversion.” They had other names for it, as well, and the most significant was “Siaynog.” This dance was what had become of the Tyrant’s greatest ritual, his moment of sharing with his Fish Speakers.\nOdrade recognized and respected the energy in this phenomenon. No Reverend Mother could fail to see that. The waste of it, however, disturbed her. Such things should be channeled and focused. This ritual needed some useful employment. All it did now was drain away forces that might prove destructive to the priests if left untapped.\nA sweet fruit odor wafted into Odrade’s nostrils. She sniffed and looked at the vents beside her window; heat from the mob and the warmed earth created an updraft. This carried odors from below through the Ixian vents. She pressed her forehead and nose against the plaz to peer directly downward. Ahhh, the dancers or the mob had tipped over a merchant’s stall. The dancers were stomping in the fruit. Yellow pulp spurted up to their thighs.\nOdrade recognized the fruit merchant among the onlookers, a familiar wizened face she had seen several times at his stall beside her building’s entrance. He appeared unconcerned by his loss. Like all the others around him, he concentrated his attention on the dancers. The five naked men moved with a disjointed high lift of their feet, an unrhythmic and seemingly uncoordinated display, which came around periodically to a repeated pattern—three of the dancers with both feet on the ground and the other two held aloft by their partners.\nOdrade recognized it. This was related to the ancient Fremen way of sandwalking. This curious dance was a fossil with roots in the need to move without signaling your presence to a worm.\nPeople began to crowd nearer the dancers out of the bazaar’s great rectangle, hopping upward like children’s toys to raise their eyes above the throng for a glimpse of the five naked men.\nOdrade saw Sheeana’s escort then, movement far off to the right where a wide avenue entered the square. Animal- track symbols on a building there said the wide avenue was God’s Way. Historical awareness said the avenue had been Leto Il’s route into the city from his high-walled Sareer far off to the south. With a care for details, one could still discern some of the forms and patterns that had been the Tyrant’s city of Onn, the festival center built around the more ancient city of Arrakeen. Onn had obliterated many marks of Arrakeen but some avenues persisted: some buildings were too useful to replace. Buildings inevitably defined streets.\nSheeana’s escort came to a stop where the avenue debouched into the bazaar. Yellow-helmeted Guardians probed ahead, clearing a path with their staves. The guards were tall: When grounded, the thick, two-meter staff would come only to the shoulders of the shortest among them. Even in the most disordered crowd you could not miss a Priest Guardian, but Sheeana’s protectors were the tallest of the tall.\nThey were in motion once more leading their party toward Odrade. Their robes swung open at each stride revealing the slick gray of the best stillsuits. They walked straight ahead, fifteen of them in a shallow vee which skirted the thicker clusters of stalls.\nA loose band of priestesses with Sheeana at their center marched behind the guards. Odrade caught glimpses of Sheeana’s distinctive figure, that sun-streaked hair and proudly upthrust face, within her escort. It was the yellow- helmeted Priest Guardians, though, who attracted Odrade’s attention. They moved with an arrogance conditioned into them from infancy. These guards knew they were better\nthan the ordinary folk. And the ordinary folk reacted predictably by opening a way for Sheeana’s party.\nIt was all done so naturally that Odrade could see the ancient pattern of it as though she watched another ritual dance, which had not changed in millennia.\nAs she had often done, Odrade thought of herself now as an archeologist, not one who sifted the dusty detritus of the ages but rather a person who focused where the Sisterhood frequently concentrated its awareness: on the ways people carried their past within them. The Tyrant’s own design was apparent here. Sheeana’s approach was a thing laid down by the God Emperor himself.\nBeneath Odrade’s window the five naked men continued to dance. Among the onlookers, however, Odrade saw a new awareness. Without any concerted turning of heads toward the approaching phalanx of Priest Guardians, the watchers below Odrade knew.\nAnimals always know when the herders arrive.\nNow, the crowd’s restiveness produced a quicker pulse. They would not be denied their chaos! A clod of dirt flew from the throng’s outskirts and struck the ground near the dancers. The five men did not miss a step in their extended pattern but their speed increased. The length of the series between repetitions spoke of remarkable memories.\nAnother clod of dirt flew from the crowd and struck a dancer’s shoulder. None of the five men faltered.\nThe crowd began to scream and chant. Some shouted curses. The chanting became a hand-clapping intrusion onto the dancers’ movements.\nStill, the pattern did not change.\nThe mob’s chanting became a harsh rhythm, repeated shouts that echoed against the Great Square’s wails. They were trying to break the dancers’ pattern. Odrade sensed a profound importance in the scene below her.\nSheeana’s party had come more than halfway across the bazaar. They moved through the wider lanes between stalls\nand turned now directly toward Odrade. The crowd was at its densest about fifty meters ahead of the Priest Guardians. The Guardians moved at a steady pace, disdainful of those who scurried aside. Under the yellow helmets, eyes were fixed straight ahead, staring over the mob. Not one of the advancing Guardians gave any outward sign that he saw mob or dancers or any other barrier that might impede him.\nThe mob stopped its chanting abruptly as though an invisible conductor had waved his hand for silence. The five men continued to dance. The silence below Odrade was charged with a power that made her neck hairs stand up. Directly below Odrade, the three Priest Guardians among the onlookers turned as one man and moved out of view into her building.\nDeep within the crowd, a woman shouted a curse.\nThe dancers gave no sign that they heard.\nThe mob crowded forward, diminishing the space around the dancers by at least half. The girl who guarded the dancers’ stillsuits and robes no longer was visible.\nOnward, Sheeana’s phalanx marched, the priestesses and their young charge directly behind.\nViolence erupted off to Odrade’s right. People there began striking each other. More missiles arced toward the five dancing men. The mob resumed its chant in a quicker beat.\nAt the same time, the rear of the crowd parted for the Guardians. Watchers there did not take their attention from the dancers, did not pause in their contributions to the growing chaos, but a way was opened through them.\nAbsolutely captivated, Odrade stared downward. Many things occurred simultaneously: the melee, the people cursing and striking each other, the continuing chant, the implacable advance of the Guardians.\nWithin the shield of priestesses, Sheeana could be seen darting her gaze from side to side, trying to see the excitement around her.\nSome within the crowd produced clubs and struck out at the people around them, but nobody threatened the Guardians or any other member of Sheeana’s party.\nThe dancers continued to prance within a tightening circle of watchers. Everyone crowded close against Odrade’s building, forcing her to press her head against the plaz and peer at a sharp angle downward.\nThe Guardians leading Sheeana’s party advanced through a widening lane amidst this chaos. The priestesses looked neither left nor right. Yellow-helmeted Guardians stared straight ahead.\nDisdain was too feeble a word for this performance, Odrade decided. And it was not correct to say that the swirling mob ignored the incoming party. Each was aware of the other but they existed in separate worlds, observing the strict rules of that separation. Only Sheeana ignored the secret protocol, hopping upward to try for a glimpse past the bodies shielding her.\nDirectly beneath Odrade, the mob surged forward. The dancers were overwhelmed by the crush, swept aside like ships caught in a gigantic wave. Odrade saw spots of naked flesh being pummeled and thrust from hand to hand through the screaming chaos. Only by the most intense concentration could Odrade separate the sounds being Carried up to her.\nIt was madness!\nNone of the dancers resisted. Were they being killed? Was it a sacrifice? The Sisterhood’s analyses did not even begin to touch this actuality.\nYellow helmets moved aside beneath Odrade, opening a way for Sheeana and her priestesses to pass into the building, then the Guardians closed ranks. They turned and formed a protective arc around the building’s entrance. They held their staves horizontally and overlapped at waist height.\nThe chaos beyond them began to subside. None of the dancers was visible but there were casualties, people sprawled on the ground, others staggering. Bloody heads could be seen.\nSheeana and", " the mob surged forward.

None of the dancers was visible but there were casualties, people sprawled on the ground, others staggering. Bloody heads could be seen.\nSheeana and the priestesses were out of Odrade’s view in the building. Odrade sat back and tried to sort out what she had just witnessed.\nIncredible.\nAbsolutely none of the Sisterhood’s accounts or holophoto records captured this thing! Part of it was the smells—dust, sweat, an intense concentration of human pheromones. Odrade took a deep breath. She felt herself trembling inside. The mob had become individuals who moved out into the bazaar. She saw weepers. Some cursed. Some laughed.\nThe door behind Odrade burst open. Sheeana entered laughing. Odrade whirled and glimpsed her own guards and some of the priestesses in the hallway before Sheeana closed the door.\nThe girl’s dark brown eyes glittered with excitement. Her narrow face, already beginning to soften with the curves she would display as an adult, was tense with suppressed emotion. The tension dissolved as she focused on Odrade.\nVery good, Odrade thought, as she observed this. Lesson one of the bonding already has begun.\n“You saw the dancers?” Sheeana demanded, whirling and Skipping across the floor to stop in front of Odrade. “Weren't they beautiful? | think they’re so beautiful! Cania didn’t want me to look. She says it’s dangerous for me to take part in Siaynoq. But | don’t care! Shaitan would never eat those dancers!”\nWith a sudden outflowing awareness, which she had experienced before only during the spice agony, Odrade saw through to the total pattern of what she had just witnessed in the Great Square. It had needed only Sheeana’s words and presence to make the thing clear.\nA language!\nDeep within the collective awareness of these people they carried, all unconsciously, a language that could say things to them they did not want to hear. The dancers spoke it. Sheeana spoke it. The thing was composed of voice tones and movements and pheromones, a complex and subtle combination that had evolved the way all languages evolved.\nOut of necessity.\nOdrade grinned at the happy girl standing in front of her. Now, Odrade knew how to trap the Tleilaxu. Now, she knew more of Taraza’s design.\nI must accompany Sheeana into the desert at the first opportunity. We will wait only for the arrival of this Tleilaxu Master, this Waff. We will take him with us!\nLiberty and Freedom are complex concepts. They go back to religious ideas of Free Will and are related to the Ruler Mystique implicit in absolute monarchs. Without absolute monarchs patterned after the Old Gods and ruling by the grace of a belief in religious indulgence, Liberty and Freedom would never have gained their present meaning. These ideals owe their very existence to past examples of oppression. And the forces that maintain such ideas will erode unless renewed by dramatic teaching or new oppressions. This is the most basic key to my life.\n—LETO II, GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE: DAR-ES-BALAT RECORDS\nS ome thirty kilometers into the thick forest northeast of the Gammu Keep, Teg kept them waiting under the cover of a life-shield blanket until the sun dipped behind the high ground to the west.\n“Tonight, we go a new direction,” he said.\nFor three nights now, he had led them through tree- enclosed darkness with a masterful demonstration of Mentat Memory, each step directed precisely along the track that Patrin had laid out for him.\n“I’m stiff from too much sitting,” Lucilla complained. “And it’s going to be another cold night.”\nTeg folded the life-shield blanket and put it in the top of his pack. “You two can start moving around a bit,” he said. “But we won't leave here until full dark.”\nTeg sat up with his back against the bole of a thickly branched conifer, looking out from the deeper shadows as Lucilla and Duncan moved into the glade. The two of them stood there a moment, shivering as the last of the day’s warmth fled into the night’s chill. Yes, it would be cold again tonight, Teg thought, but they would have little chance to think about that.\nThe unexpected.\nSchwangyu would never expect them still to be this close to the Keep and on foot.\nTaraza should have been more emphatic in her warnings about Schwangyu, Teg thought. Schwangyu’s violent and open disobedience of a Mother Superior defied tradition. Mentat logic would not accept the situation without more data.\nHis memory brought up a saying from school days, one of those warning aphorisms by which a Mentat was supposed to rein in his logic.\n“Given a trail of logic, occam’s razor laid out with impeccable detail, the Mentat may follow such logic to personal disaster.”\nSo logic was known to fail.\nHe thought back to Taraza’s behavior on the Guildship and immediately afterward. She wanted me to know | would be completely on my own. | must see the problem in my own way, not in her way.\nSo the threat from Schwangyu had to be a real threat that he discovered and faced and solved on his own.\nTaraza had not known what would happen to Patrin because of all this.\nTaraza did not really care what happened to Patrin. Or to me. Or to Lucilla.\nBut what about the ghola?\nTaraza must care!\nIt was not logical that she would .. . Teg dumped this line of reasoning. Taraza did not want him to act logically. She wanted him to do exactly what he was doing, what he had always done in the tight spots.\nThe unexpected.\nSo there was a species of logic to all of this but it kicked the performers out of the nest into chaos.\nFrom which we must make our own order.\nGrief welled up in his consciousness. Patrin! Damn you, Patrin! You knew and I didn’t! What will | do without you?\nTeg could almost hear the old aide’s response, that stiffly formal voice Patrin always used when he was chiding his commander.\n“You will do your best, Bashar.”\nThe most coldly progressive reasoning said Teg would never again see Patrin in the flesh nor hear the old man’s actual voice. Still... the voice remained. The person persisted in memory.\n“Shouldn’t we be going?”\nIt was Lucilla, standing close in front of his position beneath the tree. Duncan waited beside her. Both of them had shouldered their packs.\nWhile he sat thinking, night had fallen. Rich starlight created vague shadows in the glade. Teg lifted himself to his feet, took his pack and, bending to avoid the low branches, emerged into the glade. Duncan helped Teg shoulder his pack.\n“Schwangyu will consider this eventually,” Lucilla said. “Her searchers will come after us here. You know it.”\n“Not until they have followed out the false trail and found the end of it,” Teg said. “Come.”\nHe led the way westward through an opening in the trees.\nThree nights he had led them along what he called “Patrin’s memory-path.” As he walked on this fourth night, Teg berated himself for not projecting the logical consequences of Patrin’s behavior.\nI understood the depths of his loyalty but I did not project that loyalty into a most obvious result. We were together so many years | thought | knew his mind as | knew my own. Patrin, damn you! There was no need for you to die!\nTeg admitted to himself then that there had been a need. Patrin had seen it. The Mentat had not permitted himself to see it. Logic could move just as blindly as any other faculty.\nAs the Bene Gesserit often said and demonstrated.\nSo we walk. Schwangyu does not expect this.\nTeg was forced to admit that walking the wild places of Gammu created a whole new perspective for him. This entire region had been allowed to overgrow with plant life during the Famine Times and the Scattering. It had been replanted later but mostly as a random wilderness. Secret trails and private landmarks guided today’s access. Teg imagined Patrin as a youth learning this region—that rocky butte visible in starlight through a gap in the trees, that spiked promontory, these lanes through giant trees.\n“They will expect us to make a run for a no-ship,” he and Patrin had agreed, fleshing out their plan. “The decoy must take the searchers in that direction.”\nPatrin had not said that he would be the decoy.\nTeg swallowed past a lump in his throat.\nDuncan could not be protected in the Keep, he justified himself.\nThat was true.\nLucilla had jittered through their first day under the life- Shield that protected them from discovery by the instruments of aerial searchers.\n“We must get word to Taraza!”\n“When we can.”\n“What if something happens to you? | must know all of your escape plan.”\n“If something happens to me, you will not be able to follow Patrin’s path. There isn’t time to put it in your memory.”\nDuncan took little part in the conversation that day. He watched them silently or dozed, awakening fitful and with an angry look in his eyes.\nOn the second day under the shielding blanket, Duncan suddenly demanded of Teg: “Why do they want to kill me?”\n“To frustrate the Sisterhood’s plan for you,” Teg said.\nDuncan glared at Lucilla. “What is that plan?”\nWhen Lucilla did not answer, Duncan said: “She knows. She knows because I’m supposed to depend on her. I’m\nSupposed to love her!”\nTeg thought Lucilla concealed her dismay quite well. Obviously, her plans for the ghola had fallen into disarray, all of the sequencing thrown out of joint by this flight.\nDuncan’s behavior revealed another possibility: Was the ghola a latent Truthsayer? What additional powers had been bred into this ghola by the sly Tleilaxu?\nAt their second nightfall in the wilderness, Lucilla was full of accusations. “Taraza ordered you to restore his original memories! How can you do that out here?”\n“When we reach sanctuary.”\nA silent and acutely alert Duncan accompanied them that night. There was a new vitality in him. He had heard!\nNothing must harm Teg, Duncan thought. Wherever and whatever sanctuary might be, Teg must reach it safely. Then, | will know!\nDuncan was not sure what he would know but now he fully accepted the prize in it. This wilderness must lead to that goal. He recalled staring out at the wild places from the Keep and how he had thought to be free here. That sense of untouched freedom had vanished. The wilderness was only a path to something more important.\nLucilla, bringing up the rear of this march, forced herself to remain"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_56efaef7c7a0f297ee72fc1bb6cd157ab5fb03fcddecfea4cdd6f8d7ac523214_v2"}
