里路，为了省粮省钱，都是在家里吃饭——晚上回去，第二天早上到校，顺便带着一顿中午饭。每天来回二十里路，与他一块上学的金波和大队书记田福堂的儿子润生都有自行车，只有他是两条腿走路。金波就和他共骑一辆车子。两年下来，润生的车子还是新的，金波的车子已经破烂不堪了。他父亲只好又给他买了一辆新的。现在到了县城，离家六、七十里路，每星期六回家，他更是离不开金波的自行车了。另外，到这里来以后，金波还好几次给他塞过白面票。不过，他推让着没有要——因为这年头谁的白面票也不宽裕；再说，几个白面馍除顶不了什么事，还会惯坏他的胃口的……唉，尽管上这学是如此艰难，但孙少平内心深处还是有一种说不出的高兴滋味。他现在已经从山乡圪崂里来到了一个大世界。对于一个贫困农民的儿子来说，这本身就是一件多么了不起的事啊！ \n　　每天，只要学校没什么事，孙少平就一个人出去在城里的各种地方转：大街小巷，城里城外，角角落落，反正没去过的地方都去。除过几个令人敬畏的机关——如县革委会、县武装部和县公安局外，他差不多在许多机关的院子里都转过了——大多是假装上厕所而哄过门房老头进去的。由于人生地不熟，他也不感到这身破衣服在公众场所中的寒酸，自由自在地在这个城市的四面八方逛荡。他在这其间获得了无数新奇的印象，甚至觉得弥漫在城市上空的炭烟味闻起来都是别具一格的。当然，许许多多新的所见所识他都还不能全部理解，但所有的一切无疑都在他的精神上产生了影响。透过城市生活的镜面，他似乎更清楚地看见了他已经生活过十几年的村庄——在那个位所熟悉的古老的世界里，原来许多有意义的东西，现在看起来似乎有点平淡无奇了。而那里许多本来重要的事物过去他却并没有留心，现在倒突然如此鲜活地来到了他的心间。 \n　　除过这种漫无目的的转悠，他现在还养成了一种看课外书的习惯。这习惯还是在上初中的最后一年开始的。有一次他去润生家，发现他们家的箱盖上有一本他妈夹鞋样的厚书，名字叫《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。起先他没在意——一本炼钢的书有什么意思呢？他随便翻了翻，又觉得不对劲。明明是一本炼钢的书，可里面却不说炼钢炼铁，说的全是一个叫保尔·柯察金的苏联人的长长短短。他突然对这本奇怪的书产生了强烈的好奇心。他想看看这本书倒究是怎么回事。润生说这书是他姐的——润生他姐在县城教书，很少回家来；这书是润生他妈从城里拿回来夹鞋样的。\n######################\nOutput:",
