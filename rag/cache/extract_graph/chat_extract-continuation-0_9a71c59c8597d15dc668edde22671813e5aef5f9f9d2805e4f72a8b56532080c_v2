Theories had been articulated, alternatives carefully worked out, and subordinates deployed, all thoroughly briefed. His key squad leaders had committed Gammu to memory—where partisan help might be available, every bolt hole, every known strongpoint and which access routes were most vulnerable. He had warned them especially about Futars. The possibility that humanoid beasts might be allies could not be overlooked. Rebels who had helped ghola-ldaho escape from Gammu had insisted Futars were created to hunt and kill Honored Matres. Knowing the accounts of Dortujla and others, you could almost pity Honored Matres if this were true, except that no pity could be spared for those who never showed it to others.\nThe attack was taking its designed shape—scout ships laying down a decoy barrage and heavy carriers moving into strike position. Teg became now what he thought of as “the instrument of my instruments.” It was difficult to determine which commanded and which responded.\nNow, the delicate part.\nUnknowns were to be feared. A good commander kept that firmly in mind. There were always unknowns.\nDecoys were nearing the defensive perimeter. He saw enemy no-ships and foldspace sensors—bright dots arrayed through his awareness. Teg superimposed this onto the positions of his force. Every order he gave must appear to originate from a battle-plot they all shared.\nHe felt thankful Murbella had not joined him. Any Reverend Mother might see through his deception. But no one had questioned Odrade’s order that Murbella wait with her party at a safe distance.\n“Potential Mother Superior. Guard this one well.”\nExplosive demolition of decoys began with a random display of brilliant flashes around the planet. He leaned forward, staring at projections.\n“There’s the pattern!”\nThere was no such pattern but his words created belief and pulses quickened. No one questioned that the Bashar had seen vulnerability in the defenses. His hands flashed over the comboard, sending his ships forward in a blazing display that littered space behind them with enemy fragments.\n“All right! Let’s go!”\nHe fed the flagship’s course directly into Navigation, then turned full attention to Fire Control. Silent explosions dotted Space around them as the flagship mopped up surviving elements of Gammu’s perimeter guardians.\n“More decoys!” he ordered.\nGlobes of white light blinked in the projection fields.\nAttention in the command bay concentrated on the fields, not on their Bashar. The unexpected! Teg, justly famous for that, was confirming his reputation.\n“I find this oddly romantic,” Streggi said.\nRomantic? No romance in this! The time for romance was past and yet to come. A certain aura might surround plans\nfor violence. He accepted that. Historians created their own brand of drama-cum-romance. But now? This was adrenaline time! Romance distracted you from necessities. You had to be cold inside, a clear and unimpaired line between mind and body.\nAs his hands moved in the comboard’s field, Teg realized what had driven Streggi to speak. Something primitive about the death and destruction being created here. This was a moment cut out of normal order. A disturbing return to ancient tribal patterns.\nShe sensed a tom-tom in her breast and voices chanting: “Kill! KIN! KIN!”\nHis vision of guardian no-ships showed survivors fleeing in panic.\nGood! Panic has a way of spreading and weakening your enemies.\n“There’s Barony.”\nIdaho had converted him to the old Harkonnen name for the sprawling city with its giant black centerpiece of plasteel.\n“We'll land on the Flat to the north.”\nHe spoke the words but his hands gave the orders.\nQuickly now!\nFor brief moments when they disgorged troops, no-ships were visible and vulnerable. He held elements of the entire force responsive to his comboard and responsibility was heavy.\n“This is only a feint. We go in and out after inflicting serious damage. Junction is our real target.”\nOdrade’s parting admonition lay there in memory. “Honored Matres must be taught a lesson such as never before. Attack us and you get hurt badly. Press us and the pain can be enormous. They’ve heard about Bene Gesserit punishments. We're notorious. No doubt Spider Queen Sniggered a bit. You must shove that snigger down her throat!”\n“Quit ship!”\nThis was the vulnerable moment. Space above them remained empty of threat but fire lances arced inward from the east. His gunners could handle those. He concentrated on the possibility that enemy no-ships might return for a suicide attack. Command bay projections showed his hammerships and troop carriers pouring from the holds. The shock force, an armored elite on suspensors, already had the perimeter secured.\nThere went the portable comeyes to spread his field of observation and relay the intimate details of violence. Communication, the key to responsive command, but it also displayed bloody destruction.\n“All clear!”\nThe signal rang through the bay.\nHe lifted off the Flat and repositioned in full invisibility. Now, only the comlinks gave defenders a clue to his position and that was masked by decoy relays.\nProjection displayed the monstrous rectangle of the ancient Harkonnen center. It had been built as a block of light-absorbing metal to confine slaves. The elite had lived in garden mansions on top. Honored Matres had returned it to its former oppression.\nThree of his giant hammerships came into view.\n“Clear the top of that thing!” he ordered. “Wipe it clean but do as little damage as possible to the structure.”\nHe knew his words were superfluous but spoke for the release. Everyone in the attack force knew what he wanted.\n“Relay reports!” he ordered.\nInformation began flowing from the horseshoe on his shoulders. He brought it up on secondary. Comeyes showed his troops clearing the perimeter. Battle overhead and on the ground was well in hand for at least fifty klicks out. Going far better than he had expected. So Honored Matres kept their heavy stuff off-planet, not anticipating bold\nattack. A familiar attitude and he had Idaho to thank for predicting it.\n“They're power-blind. They think heavy armor is for space and only light stuff for the ground. Heavy weapons are brought down as needed. No sense keeping them on planet. Takes too much energy. Besides, awareness of all that heavy stuff up there has a quieting effect on captive populations.”\nIdaho’s concepts of weaponry were devastating.\n“We tend to fix our minds on what we believe we know. A projectile is a projectile even when miniaturized to contain poisons or biologicals.”\nInnovations in protective equipment improved mobility. Built into uniforms where possible. And Idaho had brought back the shield with its awesome destruction when struck by a lasgun beam. Shields on suspensors hidden in what appeared to be soldiers (but were actually inflated uniforms) spread out ahead of troops. Lasgun fire at them produced clean atomics to clear large areas.\nWill Junction be this easy?\nTeg doubted it. Necessity enforced quick adaptation to new methods.\nThey could have shields on Junction in two days.\nAnd no inhibitions about how to employ them.\nShields had dominated the Old Empire, he knew, because of that oddly important set of words called “Great Convention.” Honorable people did not misuse weapons of their feudal society. If you dishonored the Convention, your peers turned against you with united violence. More than that, there had been the intangible, “Face,” that some called “Pride.”\nFace! My position in the pack.\nMore important to some than life itself.\n“This is costing us very little,” Streggi said.\nShe was becoming quite the battle analyst and much too banal for Teg’s liking. Streggi meant they were losing few lives but perhaps she spoke truer than she knew.\n“It’s difficult to think of cheap devices doing the job,” Idaho had said. “But that’s a powerful weapon.”\nIf your weapons cost only a small fraction of the energy your enemy spent, you had a potent lever that could prevail against seemingly overwhelming odds. Prolong the conflict and you wasted enemy substance. Your foe toppled because control of production and workers was lost.\n“We can begin to pull out,” he said turning away from the projections as his hands repeated the order. “I want casualty reports as soon as—” He broke off and turned at a sudden Stir.\nMurbella?\nHer projection was repeated in all of the bay’s fields. Her voice blared from the images: “Why are you disregarding reports from your perimeter?” She overrode his board and the projections displayed a field commander caught in mid- sentence: “...orders, | will have to deny their request.”\n“Repeat,” Murbella said.\nThe field commander’s sweaty features turned toward his mobile comeye. The comsystem compensated and he appeared to look directly into Teg’s eyes.\n“Repeating: | have self-styled refugees here asking for asylum. Their leader says he has an agreement requiring the Sisterhood to honor his request but without orders...”\n“Who is he?” Teg demanded.\n“He calls himself Rabbi.”\nTeg moved to resume control of his comboard. “I don’t know of any—”\n“Wait!” Murbella overrode his board.\nHow does she do that?\nAgain her voice filled the bay. “Bring him and his party to the flagship. Make it quick.” She silenced the perimeter relay.\nTeg was outraged but at a disadvantage. He chose one of the multiple images and glared at it. “How dare you interfere?”\n“Because you don’t have the proper data. The Rabbi is within his rights. Prepare to receive him with honors.”\n“Explain.”\n“No! There’s no need for you to know. But it was proper for me to make this decision when | saw you were not responding.”\n“That commander was in a diversionary area! Not important to—”\n“But the Rabbi’s request has priority.”\n“You're as bad as Mother Superior!”\n“Perhaps worse. Now hear me! Get those refugees into your flagship. And prepare to receive me.”\n“Absolutely not! You are to stay where you are!”\n“Bashar! There’s something about this request that demands a Reverend Mother’s attention. He says they are in peril because they gave temporary sanctuary to the Reverend Mother Lucilla. Accept this or step down.”\n“Then let me get my people aboard and pull back first. We'll rendezvous when we're clear.”\n“Agreed. But treat those refugees with courtesy.”\n“Now, get off my projections. You’ve blinded me and that was foolish!”\n“You have everything well in hand, Bashar. During this hiatus another of our ships accepted four Futars. They came asking that we take them to Handlers but | ordered them confined. Treat them with extreme caution.”\nThe bay’s projections resumed battle status. Teg once more called in his force. He was seething and it was minutes before he restored a sense of command. Did Murbella know how she undermined his authority? Or should he take this as a measure of the importance she attached to the refugees?\nWhen the situation was secure, he turned the bay over to an aide and, riding on Streggi’s shoulders, went to see these important refugees. What was so vital about them that Murbella risked interference?\nThey were in a troop-carrier hold, a congealed party held apart by a cautious commander.\nWho knows what may be concealed among these unknowns?\nThe Rabbi, identifiable because he was being deferred to by the field commander, stood with a brown-robed woman at the near side of his people. He was a small, bearded man wearing a white skullcap. Cold light made him appear ancient. The woman shielded her eyes with a hand. The Rabbi was speaking and his words became audible as Teg approached.\nThe woman was under verbal attack!\n“The prideful one will be brought low\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is a planet where partisan help might be available, with known strongpoints and vulnerable access routes.
