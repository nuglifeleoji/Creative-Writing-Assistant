He often finds himself in conversations with other significant figures, such as 破壁人, 井上宏一, 章北海, and 罗辑博士, where he questions the implications of their statements and seeks insights on complex issues.\n\nIn the realm of scientific inquiry, 泰勒 is involved in discussions about high-energy particle detection and the potential applications of nuclear fusion as a weapon. His strategic discussions also extend to military forces, where he contemplates self-sacrifice in a futuristic context and the necessity of human involvement in combat scenarios. He is portrayed as a political figure who has lived a reclusive life as a 面壁者 (Wallfacer), focusing on the development of space technologies like space elevators and chemical propulsion rockets.\n\n泰勒's character is marked by a sense of introspection and emotional complexity. He stands in the rain in 鹿儿岛, reflecting on his life choices, which evokes feelings of happiness and longing. He also grapples with moral and strategic dilemmas that significantly impact the future of Earth, showcasing his role as a decision-maker in critical situations. Despite his serious engagements, he sometimes expresses a sense of disinterest in those around him, viewing many as inconsequential.\n\nIn his interactions, 泰勒 demonstrates respect and politeness, especially when meeting with an elderly figure, where he strives to overcome physical pain. He is also depicted as a long-distance traveler, engaging in dialogues that explore external matters and the broader implications of his actions. His role as the flight commander of the space shuttle \"\"Mayflower\"\" underscores his leadership capabilities in high-stakes environments.\n\nMoreover, 泰勒's involvement in the 面壁者 initiative is significant, as his suicide profoundly affects the Wallfacer plan, highlighting the weight of his decisions. He actively participates in discussions that challenge the plans of others, such as 希恩斯, and seeks to persuade the elderly figure to preserve his organization.\n\nOverall, 泰勒 emerges as a complex character navigating the intersections of science, military strategy, and personal reflection, embodying the struggles and responsibilities of leadership in a tumultuous world.
