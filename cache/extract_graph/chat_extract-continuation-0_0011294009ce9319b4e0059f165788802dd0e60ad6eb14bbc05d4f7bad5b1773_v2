The next step is obvious.”\nSeeing Waff’s reaction to her bold lie, Taraza continued to watch him carefully. He was at his most dangerous right\nnow.\nA look of rage came over Waff’s face. The things the witches knew were too dangerous! He did not doubt Taraza’s claim in the slightest. / must kill her no matter the consequences to me! We must kill them all. Abominations! It’s their word and it describes them perfectly.\nTaraza correctly interpreted his expression. She spoke quickly: “You are in absolutely no danger from us as long as you do not injure our designs. Your religion, your way of life, those are your business.”\nWaff hesitated, not so much from what Taraza said as from the reminder of her powers. What else did they know? To continue in a subservient position, though! After rejecting such an alliance with the Honored Matres. And with ascendancy so near after all of those millennia. Dismay filled him. The minority among his councillors had been right after all: “There can be no bond between our peoples. Any accord with powindah forces is a union based upon evil.”\nTaraza still sensed the potential violence in him. Had she pushed him too far? She held herself in defensive readiness. An involuntary jerking of his arms alerted her. Weapons in his sleeves! Tleilaxu resources were not to be underestimated. Her snoopers had detected nothing.\n“We know about the weapons you carry,” she said. Another bold lie suggested itself. “If you make a mistake now, the whores will also learn how you use those weapons.”\nWaff took three shallow breaths. When he spoke, he had himself under control: “We will not be Bene Gesserit satellites!”\nTaraza responded in an even-toned, soothing voice: “l have not by word or action suggested such a role for you.”\nShe waited. There was no change in Waff’s expression, no slightest shift in the unfocused glare he directed at her.\n“You threaten us,” he muttered. “You demand that we Share everything we—”\n“Share!” she snapped. “One does not share with unequal partners.”\n“And what would you share with us?” he demanded.\nShe spoke with the chiding tone she would use to a child: “Ser Waff, ask yourself why you, a ruling member of your oligarchy, came to this meeting?”\nHis voice still firmly controlled, Waff countered: “And why did you, Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, come here?”\nShe spoke mildly: “To strengthen us.”\n“You did not say what you would share,” he accused. “You still hope for advantage.”\nTaraza continued to watch him carefully. She had seldom sensed such suppressed rage in a human. “Ask me openly what you want,” she said.\n“And you will give it out of your great generosity!”\n“I will negotiate.”\n“Where was the negotiation when you ordered me... ORDERED ME! to—”\n“You came here firmly resolved to break any agreement we made,” she said. “Not once have you tried to negotiate! You sit in front of someone willing to bargain with you and you can only—”\n“Bargain?” Waff’s memory was hurled back to the Honored Matre’s anger at that word.\n“| said it,” Taraza said. “Bargain.”\nSomething like a smile twitched the corners of Waff’s mouth. “You think | have authority to bargain with you?”\n“Have a care, Ser Waff,” she said. “You have the ultimate authority. It resides in that final ability to destroy an opponent utterly. | have not threatened that, but you have.” She glanced at his sleeves.\nWaff sighed. What a quandary. She was powindah! How could one bargain with a powindah?\n“We have a problem that cannot be resolved by rational means,” Taraza said.\nWaff hid his surprise. Those were the very words the Honored Matre had used! He cringed inwardly at what that might signify. Could Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres make common cause? Taraza’s bitterness argued otherwise, but when were the witches to be trusted?\nOnce more, Waff wondered if he dared sacrifice himself to eliminate this witch. What would it serve? Others among them surely knew what she knew. It would only precipitate the disaster. There was that internal dispute among the witches, but, again, that might just be another ruse.\n“You ask us to share something,” Taraza said. “What if | were to offer you some of our prize human bloodlines?”\nThere was no mistaking how Waff’s interest quickened.\nHe said: “Why should we come to you for such things? We have our tanks and we can pick up genetic examples almost anywhere.”\n“Examples of what?” she asked.\nWaff sighed. You could never escape that Bene Gesserit incisiveness. It was like a sword thrust. He guessed that he had revealed things to her that led naturally to this subject. The damage already had been done. She correctly deduced (or spies had told her!) that the wild pool of human genes held little interest for the Tleilaxu with their more sophisticated knowledge of life’s innermost language. It never paid to underestimate either the Bene Gesserit or the products of their breeding programs. God Himself knew they had produced Muad’Dib and the Prophet!\n“What more would you demand in exchange for this?” he asked.\n“Bargaining at last!” Taraza said. “We both know, of course, that | am offering breeding mothers of the Atreides line.” And she thought: “Let him hope for that! They will look like Atreides but they will not be Atreides!”\nWaff felt his pulse quicken. Was this possible? Did she have the slightest idea what the Tleilaxu might learn from an examination of such source material?\n“We would want first selection of their offspring,” Taraza said.\n“No!”\n“Alternate first selection, then?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“What do you mean, perhaps?” She leaned forward. Waff’s intensity told her she was on a hot trail.\n“What else would you ask of us?”\n“Our breeding mothers must have unfettered access to your genetic laboratories.”\n“Are you mad?” Waff shook his head in exasperation. Did She think the Tleilaxu would give away their strongest weapon just like that?\n“Then we will accept a fully operational axlotl tank.”\nWaff merely stared at her.\nTaraza shrugged. “I had to try.”\n“I Suppose you did.”\nTaraza sat back and reviewed what she had learned here. Waff’s reaction to that Zensunni probe had been interesting. “A problem that cannot be resolved by rational means.” The words had produced a subtle effect on him. He had seemed to rise out of some place within himself, a questioning look in his eyes. Gods preserve us all! ls Waff a secret Zensunni?\nNo matter the dangers, this had to be explored. Odrade must be armed with every possible advantage on Rakis.\n“Perhaps we have done all we can for now,” Taraza said. “There is time to complete our bargain. God alone in His infinite mercy has given us infinite universes where anything may happen.”\nWaff clapped his hands once without thinking. “The gift of Surprises is the greatest gift of all!” he said.\nNot just Zensunni, Taraza thought. Sufi also. Sufi! She began to readjust her perspective on the Tleilaxu. How long have they been holding this close to their breasts?\n“Time does not count itself,” Taraza said, probing. “One has only to look at any circle.”\n“Suns are circles,” Waff said. “Each universe is a circle.” He held his breath waiting for her response.\n“Circles are enclosures,” Taraza said, picking the proper response out of her Other Memories. “Whatever encloses and limits must expose itself to the infinite.”\nWaff raised his hands to show her his palms then dropped his arms into his lap. His shoulders lost some of their tense upward thrust. “Why did you not say these things at the beginning?” he asked.\nI must exercise great care, Taraza cautioned herself. The admissions in Waff’s words and manner required careful review.\n“What has passed between us reveals nothing unless we speak more openly,” she said. “Even then, we would only be using words.”\nWaff studied her face, trying to read in that Bene Gesserit mask some confirmation of the things implied by her words and manner. She was powindah, he reminded himself. The powindah could never be trusted ... but if she shared the Great Belief...\n“Did God not send His Prophet to Rakis, there to test us and teach us?” he asked.\nTaraza delved deep into her Other Memories. A Prophet on Rakis? Muad’Dib? No... that did not square with either Sufi or Zensunni beliefs in...\nThe Tyrant! She closed her mouth into a grim line. “What one cannot control one must accept,” she said.\n“For surely that is God’s doing,” Waff replied.\nTaraza had seen and heard enough. The Missionaria Protectiva had immersed her in every known religion. Other Memories reinforced this knowledge and filled it out. She felt a great need to get herself safely away from this room. Odrade must be alerted!\n“May | make a suggestion?” Taraza asked.\nWaff nodded politely.\n“Perhaps there is here the substance of a greater bond between us than we imagined,” she said. “I offer you the hospitality of our Keep on Rakis and the services of our commander there.”\n“An Atreides?” he asked.\n“No,” Taraza lied. “But I will, of course, alert our Breeding Mistresses to your needs.”\n“And | will assemble the things you require in payment,” he said. “Why will the bargain be completed on Rakis?”\n“Is that not the proper place?” she asked. “Who could be false in the home of the Prophet?”\nWaff sat back in his chair, his arms relaxed in his lap. Taraza certainly knew the proper responses. It was a revelation he had never expected.\nTaraza stood. “Each of us listens to God personally,” she said.\nAnd together in the kehl, he thought. He looked up at her, reminding himself that she was powindah. None of them could be trusted. Caution! This woman was, after all, a Bene Gesserit witch. They were known to create religions for their own ends. Powindah!\nTaraza went to the hatch, opened it and gave her security signal. She turned once more toward Waff who still sat in his chair. He has not penetrated our true design, she thought. The ones we send to him must be chosen with extreme care. He must never suspect that he is part of our bait.\nHis elfin features composed, Waff stared back at her.\nHow bland he looked, Taraza thought. But he could be trapped! An alliance between Sisterhood and Tleilaxu offered new attractions. But on our terms!\n“Until Rakis,” she said.\nWhat social inheritances went outward with the Scattering? We know those times intimately. We know both the mental and physical settings. The Lost Ones took with them a consciousness confined mostly to manpower and hardware. There was a desperate need for room to expand driven by the myth of Freedom. Most had not learned the deeper lesson of the Tyrant, that violence builds its own limits. The Scattering was wild and random movement interpreted as growth (expansion). It was goaded by a profound fear (often unconscious) of stagnation and death.\n—THE SCATTERING:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN PROBE<|>EVENT<|>A mechanical device or process used by the Ixians, contrasted with the Tleilaxu's biological methods\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive and genetically advanced group known for their manipulation of nerves and flesh\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAFF<|>PERSON<|>A ruling member of the Tleilaxu oligarchy, involved in negotiations with the Bene Gesserit\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, skilled in negotiation and manipulation\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced genetic and mental abilities\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A violent and dominant group that the Tleilaxu and Bene Gesserit are wary of\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>A planet significant to both the Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu, associated with the Prophet\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A noble bloodline highly valued by both the Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AXLOTL TANK<|>EVENT<|>A Tleilaxu technology used for genetic manipulation and reproduction\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Bene Gesserit division focused on manipulating religions for their benefit\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>A historical event involving mass migration and expansion driven by fear of stagnation\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>WAFF<|>Taraza negotiates with Waff, representing the Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu respectively<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>TLEILAXU<|>Waff is a ruling member of the Tleilaxu oligarchy<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu are negotiating a potential alliance<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit are wary of the Honored Matres and their violent methods<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Tleilaxu have previously rejected an alliance with the Honored Matres<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>RAKIS<|>Taraza plans to complete the bargain with the Tleilaxu on Rakis<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>RAKIS<|>Waff is intrigued by the significance of Rakis in their negotiations<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ATREIDES<|>The Bene Gesserit value the Atreides bloodline for their breeding programs<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ATREIDES<|>The Tleilaxu are interested in the Atreides bloodline for genetic study<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>Taraza uses knowledge from the Missionaria Protectiva to manipulate Waff<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAFF<|>AXLOTL TANK<|>Waff is protective of the Tleilaxu's axlotl tank technology<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>THE SCATTERING<|>Taraza reflects on the historical event of The Scattering and its implications<|>5\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
