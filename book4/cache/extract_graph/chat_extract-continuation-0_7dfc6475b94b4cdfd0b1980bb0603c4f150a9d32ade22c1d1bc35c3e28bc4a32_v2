\n　　孙兰香站在这悲伤的人群中哭着。她想起奶奶和爸爸常给她说的，是毛主席把他们这样的穷人从旧社会的苦海中救了出来。从她记事开始，要是哪一年有了灾害，他们家都要吃国家的救济粮。奶奶和爸爸说，这都是毛主席老人家给他们的！要是旧社会，遇到年馑，不知要饿死多少人呢！他们全家都深深热爱大救星毛主席。每年过春节，穷得哪怕什么也不买，但总要买一张毛主席像贴在墙壁上。现在，没有了毛主席，以后可怎么办呀？ \n　　此刻，大概所有的中国人都象这孩子一样，从不同的角度，象她一样问：以后怎么办呀？ \n　　……一个月以后，十月二十一日，从北京传来了一个爆炸性的消息：“四人帮”被抓起来了！ \n　　中国，再一次显示了它的伟大无比；显示了它的镇静、自信、成熟和历史的不可逆转性。这是人民的胜利！ \n　　干怀！中国历史上灾难性的一页终于翻过去了。 \n　　十月。在这欢腾的日子里，全中国的人都好象住了十年医院；现在大病初愈，重新走到灿烂的阳光下面来啦！ \n　　当然，人们现在还不能预料未来；但一个不能再让人忍受的年代已经结束，这就应该大声地欢呼！谁也不会天真地认为，积了十年的垃圾，就能在一夜之间清理干净。但是人们坚信：尽管在原轨道上刹住的车子还要在惯性中滑一段路程，但中国历史的大轮必将重新启动，进入到一个转折性的弯道上…… \n                  第39章\n　　十一月初，田福军到省上去听传达粉碎“四人帮”的中央文件，完了还要参加省党校理论班的学习，据说要到明年初才能回来。 \n　　白天大部分时间里，田福军家里除过徐国强老汉照门外，就再没什么人了。院子里经常静悄悄的；偶尔传来徐老的一声咳嗽和他对那只老黑猫的几句溺爱的训斥话。只是在中午和晚饭时分，他女儿徐爱云才从医院回来，给他和晓霞做点饭。福军的侄女润叶最近不知为什么，也常不回家来。 \n　　徐国强虽说年龄早已过了花甲，但身板还硬朗。我们已经知道，日常没事的时候，这老汉就在院子花坛的那一小块土地上，营务各种庄稼。对他来说，这已经不是劳动，恰恰是一种休息。他觉得，要是一整天闲呆着，身子骨反而疼痛。只要劳动一会，立刻就感到筋脉舒展多了。 \n　　可是现在，气候已经寒冷，再没什么活可干了。那个花坛早已经没有了任何植物，变得一片荒凉。 \n　　这时候，徐国强老汉也象那花坛一样，荒凉而寂寞。太无聊了！一整天象\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>毛主席<|>PERSON<|>毛主席, also known as Chairman Mao, is a
