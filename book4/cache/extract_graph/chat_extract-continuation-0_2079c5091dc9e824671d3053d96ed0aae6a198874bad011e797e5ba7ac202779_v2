冬天没见一片雪，麦子旱干不说，开春动农怕也没办法下籽种。今年要象去年就好了，一年雨水不断，秋夏都是好收成……一个要死的人坐在水井边，手里捏着几包致命的毒药，心里还在盘算着日月和天年——这就是我们的兰花！ \n　　唉，可怜的人儿，对你来说，好象死是一回事，日月天年是另一回事。你也不想想，你死了以后，这一切对你又有什么意义？可你不会把这两件事混为一谈！因为你相信你死了以后还会转生到这个世界上来。是的，你怎能不再来这个世界呢？不管活在这世界上有多苦，但你总归还是那么爱这世界！你在黄土地上劳动惯了，再说，你也舍不得离开亲爱的猫蛋和狗蛋——你还要来看他们；哪怕转生成猪狗，也要再和他们生活在一起……兰花将那几包老鼠药打开，把那些灰土一样的药粉倒进手心里，头扬起来，瞥了一眼阴沉沉的天空，然后就把药粉全部倒进了自己的嘴巴。 \n　　她用两只手在冰冷的水井中捧了一掬凉水，低下头喝一口，把药粉冲下了肚子。 \n　　现在她坐在水井边的石头上，闭住眼睛，静静地等待死神的来临…… \n                  第30章\n　　孙玉厚老两口起床后刚倒罢尿盆，看见他们的外孙女猫蛋突然推门进来了。孩子的两个小脸蛋冻得通红，一见他们就哭。
