   青鹏最擅长远距离飞行，本身战斗力只是中等，但在飞行类武魂之中名列前茅。\n\n    青光一闪，一道青色光影从李鹏斌身上射出。那是一道鸟形光影，当它从李鹏斌身上飞射而出时，甚至有种是他分身飞出的感觉。\n\n    青鹏影，李鹏斌的第一魂技。\n\n    这一道青光后发先至，覆盖向刘锋，目的是让刘锋无法加入战斗，让金翔和唐月葛完成这一次打断钱磊的召唤的合作。\n\n    无疑，金翔、唐月葛、李鹏斌这一上来就发动的全面攻击，配合得相当默契，计划也非常完善。\n\n    唐月葛的双尖短枪几乎是须臾之间就到了蓝轩宇面前，速度奇快无比。\n\n    蓝轩宇右手此时还抓着召唤之门，自然只能用左手抵挡。他脚下一动，尝试闪避，但那双尖短枪像是长了眼睛一般，也略微转向，枪尖所指，依旧是蓝轩宇，眼看他已经避无可避。\n\n    青鹏影此时也已经落下，压制刘锋，让他无法回身支援蓝轩宇，金翔此时也已经接近召唤之门上空。\n\n    怎么看，三三三小组的三人都像是遭受到了全面的压制。\n\n    蓝轩宇出手了，他猛然抬起左手，手掌闪电般探出，就在那双尖短枪临身的刹那，竟一把抓住枪尖，让它停在自己面前。他手掌表面冰雾缭绕，令那短枪无法前进分毫。\n\n    唐月葛面露惊讶，要知道，他这一下投掷不只是全力以赴，更带着破风的魂技效果。破风几乎能够将他的投掷之力增强一倍，速度也增加一倍，还能锁定对手。\n\n    想要在这种情况下抓住他投掷的短枪，谈何容易？可蓝轩宇就是做到了。难道说，他的魂技还有阻隔作用？还有他的力量，也必须得十分强大。\n\n    这时候，唐月葛才突然想起来，在进行身体素质测试的时候，蓝轩宇的力量可是“十加”的成绩啊！而刘锋的动作更是出人意料，他根本没有硬挡的意思，身体迅速后撤，根本没有回身去看，用自己的后背撞向蓝轩宇。\n\n    被蓝轩宇抓住的双尖短枪突然消失，回到了唐月葛手中。\n\n    刘锋撞来，蓝轩宇的左手改抓为推，一掌按在刘锋的后背上。\n\n    直到此时，刘锋才举起手中的白龙枪，带着淡淡的冰雾，刺出白龙枪，瞬间将那片青影化解。他的行动\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LI PENGBIN<|>PERSON<|>Li Pengbin is a character
