�哥把她狠狠揍了一顿，打得鼻子口里直淌血，她后来才停止了对他们家这种放肆的辱骂。后来，他们弟兄都大了，哥哥又当了生产队长，在村里也成了一条汉子，她和二爸就更有点怯火了。二爸二妈两个人穷积极，在队里都负点责，一个是大队支委，一个是妇女主任，黑天半夜开会，三个娃娃撂在家里没人管。他们光景一烂包，二爸经常穿着烂衣薄裳，饿着肚子还常给别人讲革命大道理。村里人明不说，背后谁不耻笑他们！ \n　　现在，妇女主任已经从哭咽河的小桥上过来了，少平看见她头发梳得油光——通常都是用木梳蘸着自己的吐沫梳成这个样子的。而且又穿起了结婚时的那件已经很旧的红绸袄；因为罩衣太短，那棉袄的红边在下面露出一圈，非常扎眼，二妈这身打扮，说明她今晚上又要在公众面前露脸了。果然，她站定对少平说：“今晚上，公社会战指挥部要在学校院子里开批判会，你不参加？……人家叫我领导着布置会场，我刚把碗搁下就……唉，你姐夫……”她叹了一口气，表示了一种同情和痛惜，让少平知道她终究也是自家人。少平对她说：“你忙你的，我要到金波家去哩。” \n　　他冷淡地对他二妈打了个招呼，就转过身走了。 \n                  第8章\n　　“噢——哥！噢——哥！” \n　　孙玉厚老汉刚把自己的铺盖卷儿搬到隔壁少安的小土窑里，就听见公路下面他弟玉亭喊叫他的声音。 \n　　玉厚奇怪：玉亭为什么不上家里来？往常他有事没事吃完饭总要到他家里来坐一阵——穿着麻绳子捆绑的烂鞋，往他家前炕的铺盖卷上一靠，没命地在他的烟布袋里挖得抽半天烟。他热心公家的事，庄稼行里又不行，因此管务不起来旱烟，满年四季都是他供着。每当玉亭来的时候，他老婆也总要把家里刚吃过而剩下的饭，给玉亭热得端上来一碗。玉亭嘴里推让着，两只手一把就接住了。少安他妈知道玉亭在家里吃不饱，总要牵挂着给他吃一点。父亲去世早，玉亭从五岁起，实际上就是他两口子一手把他带大的。尽管玉亭成家以后，他老婆贺凤英那些年把少安妈欺负上一回又一回，怕老婆的玉亭连一声也不敢吭，但少安他妈不计较他。因为她从小把玉亭抚养大，心中对他有一种疼爱的感情。人常说，老嫂为母，这话可一点也不假……“噢——哥！噢——哥！”
