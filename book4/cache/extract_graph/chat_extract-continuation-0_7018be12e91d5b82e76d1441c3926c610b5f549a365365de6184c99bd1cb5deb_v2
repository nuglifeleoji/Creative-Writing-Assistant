\n　　可是，汽车甩站而过，风驰电掣般走了。人们只好朝着远去的汽车连声叫苦。 \n　　乔伯年不言不语立在人行道的一棵中国槐下。秦富功就象挤过一趟车似的，拿手帕不断揩自己汗津津的脸。市交通局长掏出圆珠笔，把刚才甩站的那辆四路车牌号记在了本子上，脸上的表情似乎说：哼，鬼子孙，等着瞧吧！五分钟以后，四路车终于来了。 \n　　这下一家伙就来了四辆，像蜻蜓交尾似的亲密地连在一起，徐徐进站了。 \n　　尽管这个站的人都能上车，但人群还是进行了一番疯狂的拥挤，以便上去抢占座位。有时候两个胖子别在车门上互不相让，后面的人就象古代士兵抬杠攻城门似的，齐心合力拥上前去打通阻塞。 \n　　等乔伯年一行人上了第三辆车的时候，已经没有座位了。张生民指着乔伯年对旁边一位坐着的姑娘说：“请你给这位老同志让个座。” \n　　那姑娘嘴一撇，扭过头去看街道上的景致，把张生民的话没当话。 \n　　“算了，算了，”乔伯年用一只手抓住悬空的扶手杠，“就站一会好了。” \n　　因为一下子来了四辆空车，车内现在还不挤，他们后面的第四辆车甚至空无一人，好象是跟着前面的三辆车跑龙套。“你们为什么四辆车跟在一块跑呢？”乔伯年问他身边售票的小伙子。 \n　　“不为什么。”售票员连看也没看他一眼。 \n　　“为什么不间隔时间一辆一辆放车？这样不是更好一些吗？” \n　　“为什么你嘴这么多？”售票员斜瞪了乔伯年一眼。 \n　　“你服务态度怎这么不好！”秦富功气得脸煞白。“态度不好又怎样？你要什么态度？” \n　　市委书记气得张口结舌，一时竟不知该说什么。根据“规定”，他不能让这位态度蛮横的售票员知道他现在在顶撞的是些什么人。 \n　　“你叫什么名字？”市交通局长在旁边恼怒地问。售票员冷笑了一声，理也不理。 \n　　交通局长正准备掏圆珠笔和笔记本，这时车已经到了下一站。车门“哗拉”一声打开，上面的人还没下完，下面的人就象决堤的洪水一般涌进了车厢。一刹那间。几位领导就被挤得一个找不见一个了。 \n　　乔伯年一下子被涌到了一排座位中间，两条腿被许多条腿夹住纹丝不能移动。他赶忙躬下腰将两手托在车窗旁的扶手杠上。幸亏他身后有两个小伙子顶着压力，否则他就根本招架不住了。
