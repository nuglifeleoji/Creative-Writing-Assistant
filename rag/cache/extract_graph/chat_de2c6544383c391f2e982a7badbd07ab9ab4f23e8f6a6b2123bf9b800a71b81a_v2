A disgusting excuse! “The ghola has been treated according to standard Bene Gesserit training practices.” Inadequate and untrue. And this ghola was not a standard object of education. There were depths in him that could only be matched by a potential Reverend Mother. And that was the problem!\n“| have made mistakes,” Schwangyu said.\nThere! That was a double-pronged answer that another Reverend Mother could appreciate.\n“You made no mistake when you damaged him,” Lucilla said.\n“But | failed to anticipate that another Reverend Mother might expose the flaws in him,” Schwangyu said.\n“He wants our powers only to escape us,” Lucilla said. “He’s thinking: Someday l'Il know as much as they do and then l'Il run away.”\nWhen Schwangyu did not respond, Lucilla said: “That was clever. If he runs, we will have to hunt him down and destroy him ourselves.”\nSchwangyu smiled.\n“I will not make your mistake,” Lucilla said. “I tell you openly what I know you would see anyway. | now understand why Taraza sent an Imprinter to one so young.”\nSchwangyu’s smile vanished. “What are you doing?”\n“I am bonding him to me the way we bond all of our acolytes to their teachers. | am treating him with candor and loyalty as one of our own.”\n“But he’s male!”\n“So the spice agony will be denied him, but nothing else. He is, | think, responding.”\n“And when the time comes for the ultimate stage of imprinting?” Schwangyu asked.\n“Yes, that will be delicate. You think it will destroy him. That, of course, was your plan.”\n“Lucilla, the Sisterhood is not unanimous in following Taraza’s designs for this ghola. Certainly, you know this.”\nIt was Schwangyu’s most powerful argument and the fact that it had been reserved for this moment said much. The fears that they might produce another Kwisatz Haderach were deep-seated and the dissension in the Bene Gesserit comparably powerful.\n“He is primitive genetic stock and not bred to be a Kwisatz Haderach,” Lucilla said.\n“But the Tleilaxu have interfered with his genetic inheritance!”\n“Yes; at our orders. They have sped up his nerve and muscle responses.”\n“Is that all they have done?” Schwangyu asked.\n“You've seen the cell studies,” Lucilla said.\n“If we could do as much as the Tleilaxu we would not need them,” Schwangyu said. “We would have our own axlotl tanks.”\n“You think they have hidden something from us,” Lucilla said.\n“They had him completely outside our observation for nine months!”\n“I have heard all of these arguments,” Lucilla said.\nSchwangyu threw up her hands in a gesture of capitulation. “He’s all yours, then, Reverend Mother. And the consequences are on your head. But you will not remove me from this post no matter what you report to Chapter House.”\n“Remove you? Certainly not. | don’t want your faction sending someone unknown to us.”\n“There is a limit to the insults | will take from you,” Schwangyu said.\n“And there’s a limit to how much treachery Taraza will accept,” Lucilla said.\n“If we get another Paul Atreides or, the Gods forbid, another Tyrant, it will be Taraza’s doing,” Schwangyu said. “Tell her | said so.”\nLucilla stood. “You may as well know that Taraza left entirely at my discretion how much melange | feed this ghola. | have already begun increasing his intake of the Spice.”\nSchwangyu pounded both fists on her desk. “Damn you all! You will destroy us yet!”\nThe Tleilaxu secret must be in their sperm. Our tests prove that their sperm does not carry forward in a straight genetic fashion. Gaps occur. Every Tleilaxu we have examined has hidden his inner self from us. They are naturally immune to an Ixian Probe! Secrecy at the deepest levels, that is their ultimate armor and their ultimate weapon.\n—BENE GESSERIT ANALYSIS, ARCHIVES CODE: BTXX441WOR\nO n a morning of Sheeana’s fourth year in priestly sanctuary, the reports of their spies brought a gleam of special interest to the Bene Gesserit watchers on Rakis.\n“She was on the roof, you say?” the Mother Commander of the Rakian Keep asked.\nTamalane, the commander, had served previously on Gammu and knew more than most about what the Sisterhood hoped to conjoin here. The spies’ report had interrupted Tamalane’s breakfast of cifruit confit laced with melange. The messenger stood at ease beside the table while Tamalane resumed eating as she reread the report.\n“On the roof, yes, Reverend Mother,” the messenger said.\nTamalane glanced up at the messenger, Kipuna, a Rakian native acolyte being groomed for sensitive local duties. Swallowing a mouthful of her confit, Tamalane said: “ ‘Bring them back!’ Those were her exact words?”\nKipuna nodded curtly. She understood the question. Had Sheeana spoken with preemptory command?\nTamalane resumed scanning the report, looking for the sensitive signals. She was glad they had sent Kipuna herself. Tamalane respected the abilities of this Rakian woman. Kipuna had the soft round features and fuzzy hair common among much of the Rakian priestly class, but there was no fuzzy brain under that hair.\n“Sheeana was displeased,” Kipuna said. “The ‘thopter passed nearby the rooftop and she saw the two manacled prisoners in it quite clearly. She knew they were being taken to death in the desert.”\nTamalane put down the report and smiled. “So she ordered the prisoners brought back to her. | find her choice of words fascinating.”\n“Bring them back?” Kipuna asked. “That seems a simple enough order. How is it fascinating?”\nTamalane admired the directness of the acolyte’s interest. Kipuna was not about to pass up a chance at learning how a real Reverend Mother’s mind worked.\n“It was not that part of her performance that interested me,” Tamalane said. She bent to the report, reading aloud: ““You are servants unto Shaitan, not servants unto servants.’” Tamalane looked up at Kipuna. “You saw and heard all of this yourself?”\n“Yes, Reverend Mother. It was judged important that | report to you personally should you have other questions.” “She still calls him Shaitan,” Tamalane said. “How that must gall them! Of course, the Tyrant himself said it: ‘They\nwill call me Shaitan.’”\n“| have seen the reports out of the hoard found at Dar-es- Balat,” Kipuna said.\n“There was no delay in bringing back the two prisoners?” Tamalane asked.\n“As quickly as a message could be transmitted to the ‘thopter, Reverend Mother. They were returned within minutes.”\n“So they are watching her and listening all the time. Good. Did Sheeana give any sign that she knew the two prisoners? Did any message pass between them?”\n“lam sure they were strangers to her, Reverend Mother. Two ordinary people of the lower orders, rather dirty and poorly clothed. They smelled of the unwashed from the perimeter hovels.”\n“Sheeana ordered the manacles removed and then she spoke to this unwashed pair. Her exact words now: What did she say?”\n““You are my people.’”\n“Lovely, lovely,” Tamalane said. “Sheeana then ordered that these two be taken away, bathed and given new clothes before being released. Tell me in your own words what happened next.”\n“She summoned Tuek who came with three of his councillor-attendants. It was... almost an argument.”\n“Memory-trance, please,” Tamalane said. “Replay the exchange for me.”\nKipuna closed her eyes, breathed deeply and fell into memory-trance. Then: “Sheeana says, ‘I do not like it when you feed my people to Shaitan.’ Councillor Stiros says, ‘They are sacrificed to Shai-hulud!’ Sheeana says, ‘To Shaitan!’ Sheeana stamps her foot in anger. Tuek says, ‘Enough, Stiros. | will not hear more of this dissension.’ Sheeana says, ‘When will you learn?’ Stiros starts to speak but Tuek silences him with a glare and says, ‘We have learned, Holy Child.” Sheeana says, ‘I want—’”\n“Enough,” Tamalane said.\nThe acolyte opened her eyes and waited silently.\nPresently, Tamalane said, “Return to your post, Kipuna. You have done very well, indeed.”\n“Thank you, Reverend Mother.”\n“There will be consternation among the priests,” Tamalane said.\n“Sheeana’s wish is their command because Tuek believes in her. They will stop using the worms as instruments of punishment.”\n“The two prisoners,” Kipuna said.\n“Yes, very observant of you. The two prisoners will tell what happened to them. The story will be distorted. People will say that Sheeana protects them from the priests.”\n“Isn't that exactly what she’s doing, Reverend Mother?”\n“Ahhhh, but consider the options open to the priests. They will increase their alternative forms of punishment— whippings and certain deprivations. While fear of Shaitan eases because of Sheeana, fear of the priests will increase.”\nWithin two months, Tamalane’s reports to Chapter House contained confirmation of her own words.\n“Short rations, especially short water rations, have become the dominant form of punishment,” Tamalane reported. “Wild rumors have penetrated the farthest reaches of Rakis and soon will find lodging on many other planets as well.”\nTamalane considered the implications of her report with care. Many eyes would see it, including some not in sympathy with Taraza. Any Reverend Mother would be able to call up an image of what must be happening on Rakis. Many on Rakis had seen Sheeana’s arrival atop a wild worm from the desert. The priestly response of secrecy had been flawed from the beginning. Curiosity unsatisfied tended to create its own answers. Guesses were often more dangerous than facts.\nPrevious reports had told of the children brought to play with Sheeana. The much-garbled stories of such children were repeated with increasing distortions and those distortions had been dutifully sent on to Chapter House. The two prisoners, returned to the streets in their new finery, only compounded the growing mythology. The Sisterhood, artists in mythology, possessed on Rakis a ready-made energy to be subtly amplified and directed.\n“We have fed a wish-fulfillment belief into the populace,” Tamalane reported. She thought of the Bene Gesserit- originated phrases as she reread her latest report.\n“Sheeana is the one we have long awaited.”\nIt was a simple enough statement that its meaning could be spread without unacceptable distortion.\n“The Child of Shai-hulud comes to chastise the priests!”\nThat one had been a bit more complicated. A few priests died in dark alleys as a result of popular fervency. This had fed a new alertness into the corps of priestly enforcers with predictable injustices inflicted upon the populace.\nTamalane thought of the priestly delegation that had waited upon Sheeana as a result of turmoil\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_de2c6544383c391f2e982a7badbd07ab9ab4f23e8f6a6b2123bf9b800a71b81a_v2"}
