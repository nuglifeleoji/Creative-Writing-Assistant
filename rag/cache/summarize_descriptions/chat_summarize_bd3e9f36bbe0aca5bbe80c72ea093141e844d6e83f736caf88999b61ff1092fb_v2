This era of stability was upheld through a combination of Leto's authoritarian governance, the disciplined enforcement of the Fish Speakers (his elite military force), and other stringent measures designed to suppress rebellion and ensure order across the Empire.  \n\nThe peace was not voluntary but imposed, ensuring that no major conflicts or wars disrupted the Empire for millennia. While descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the coercive nature of this tranquility, attributing its longevity to Leto's unyielding control and the mechanisms he instituted to preserve his reign. The Fish Speakers, as both protectors and enforcers, played a pivotal role in sustaining this peace, acting as both a military and religious order loyal to Leto.  \n\nDespite minor variations in wording, the core concept remains clear: LETO'S PEACE was a rigid, artificial stability, lasting three thousand years, directly tied to Leto II's dominion and the systems he implemented to enforce it.
