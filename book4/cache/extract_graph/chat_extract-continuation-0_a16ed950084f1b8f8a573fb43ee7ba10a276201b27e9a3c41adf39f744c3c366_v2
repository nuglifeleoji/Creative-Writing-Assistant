\n　　最为得意的当然要数金光亮！这几天，他已经不出山劳动，专门在家里操持以等待儿子回来。实际上这些家务事都由老婆忙碌，他帮不了多少忙；他只是兴奋地在家里碍手碍脚出出进进，没干什么活，倒打破了两只碗。 \n　　后来，金光亮干脆穿了一身过节的新衣裳，剃得光亮的头上包了一条白羊肚子新毛巾，衣袋里装了几盒带锡纸烟，到村里转悠去了。前地主的大儿子挺胸凸肚，迈着雄壮的步伐，专门往村中各处闲话中心热闹处走；那神气就象他本人已经成了解放军。他见人就散发纸烟，心满意足地接受村民们的恭维和道喜。受了多少年的冷落，金光亮现在要借此机会去寻找人们的尊重。 \n　　唉，几十年经受过的过分对待，看来把这人也弄得有点不正常了。瞧他！尊严和荣耀得几乎到了滑稽的地步……这天上午，金二锤在他二爸金光明的陪同下回到了双水村。二锤身穿不戴领章帽徽的黄军装，脸上挂着喜气。金光明在他们的侯生才主任被提拔到县百货公司当了副主任后，就成了我们已经知道的那个百货二门市的主任。金主任戴了一副装饰性的金丝边眼镜，胸前挂个借来的照相机，满面春风地引着侄儿进了金家湾前村的新家。 \n　　金光亮弟兄三家就象过婚嫁喜事一样，大人娃娃都穿起了新衣裳。他们在外村的亲戚也都赴来为金二锤送行。三家人的院子里飘散着油糕和小炒猪肉的香味；合烙床子咯巴巴价响个不停。邻居金俊文和金俊武两家人，也被叫去吃了一顿喜庆饭。金家湾的一些门中人都纷纷去看望了即将离家的金二锤。本来这种事，大队领导也该上门去看望，但田福堂、孙玉亭等人怎么可能向他们以前的敌人致敬呢？更何况，就是他们想去，金光亮一家人此时也未见得欢迎。金俊山是个例外，他虽然是队里的领导，但往年没有过分地伤害过同族这家成份不好的人。因此副书记按常规去金光亮家表示了祝贺之意，并被主人强行留下喝了几盅烧酒。 \n　　金二锤离家的前一天，道喜的亲戚们都先后走了。这家人仍然沉浸在喜庆的气氛中。弟兄三家人几天来都在一块吃饭；吃完饭就挤在一孔窑里兴奋地，没完没了地拉家常。 \n　　上午，金光明在院子里分别给家人照相留念，闹腾了半天。 \n　　等众人先后回到窑里后，见全家的主事人金光亮一声不吭地把一\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
