他点点头，两个人就肩并肩相跟着向半山坡的矿招待所走去。少平感到，一路上，所有的人都对着他笑。怎么晓霞也对着他笑？笑什么？他都被人笑得走不成路了！ \n　　到招待所，进了晓霞住的房子，她第一件事就是从洗漱包里拿出一面小圆镜，笑着递到他手里。 \n　　少平对着镜子一照，自己也忍不住笑了。他的脸在忙乱中根本没洗净，两个眼圈周围全是黑的，象熊猫一样可笑！ \n　　这期间，晓霞已经给他对好了半脸盆热水，拿出自己雪白的毛巾和一块圆圆的小香皂，让他重新洗一下脸。 \n　　他对着那块白毛巾踌躇了一下，便开始再一次洗脸。那块小香皂小得太秀溜，在他的大手里象一只小泥鳅，不知怎么一下子就从脖项滑进衣领中。 \n　　听见晓霞在身后“咯咯”地笑着，他立刻感到那只亲爱的小手从他脊背后面伸进来。 \n　　他的整个身子都僵直了。 \n　　她从他脊背后面抓出那块小香皂，递给他，笑得前伏后仰。 \n　　他两把洗完脸，然后猛地转过身，用一双火辣辣的眼睛盯着她，问：“我还漂亮吗？” \n　　晓霞不笑了，嘴里喃喃地说：“是的，还和原来一样漂亮……”她说着，欣喜的泪水涌出了她那双美丽的眼睛。 \n　　少平大步向她走去。两个人张开双臂，紧紧地拥抱在一起。 \n　　一切都静下来了。只有两颗年轻而火热的心脏在骤烈地搏动。外面火车汽笛的鸣叫以及各种机器的嘈杂声，都好象来自遥远的天边…… \n　　“想我了吗？”她问。 \n　　回答她的是拼命的吻。 \n　　这也是她所需要的回答。 \n　　不知过了多久，他们才手拉着手坐到床边上。 \n　　“我做梦都想不到你会来。” \n　　“为什么想不到呢？我早就准备着这次会面了，只是一直没有到铜城出差的机会。” \n　　“刚到吗？” \n　　“刚刚到。” \n　　“矿上知道你来吗？” \n　　“已经和你们矿宣传部打了招呼。” \n　　“来采访我们矿？” \n　　“采访你！” \n　　“真的……别误你的事。”“我这次到铜城，主要了解矿务局和铁路部门的矛盾。为车皮的事，他们一直在扯皮！我已经写了个公开报道的稿子，同时还写了个内参。到这里来主要是看你。公私兼顾嘛！” \n　　少平再一次抱住她，拼命在她脸上和头发上亲吻着。所有关于他和她关系的悲观想法，此刻都随着她的到来而烟消云散了。或者说，他根本不想他们以后的事，只是拥抱着这个并非梦幻中的亲爱的姑娘，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
