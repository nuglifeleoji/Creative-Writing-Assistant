Their prescient capabilities allow them to safely guide ships through **foldspace**, a method of travel that remains poorly understood by outsiders. Once convening on **Junction**, they were a dominant force in galactic commerce and transportation, wielding significant political and economic influence due to their monopoly on space travel.  \n\nHowever, their power has waned over time, particularly after being **subjugated by the Honored Matres**, a formidable sisterhood that reshaped the balance of power in the universe. Despite this, the Guild Navigators remain essential for interstellar travel, relying heavily on **melange (spice)** to sustain their mutated forms and prescient abilities. Their dependence on the spice is both a strength and a vulnerability, tying their fate to the control of Arrakis, the sole source of melange.  \n\nIn later conflicts, the Guild Navigators are perceived as a **threat to secrecy**, particularly concerning the **no-ship**—a vessel designed to evade prescient detection. Their ability to foresee hidden movements makes them dangerous to fugitives like **Duncan Idaho**, who rely on concealment. Despite their diminished autonomy, their navigational expertise ensures their continued relevance, even as they navigate a universe where their once-uncontested dominance has been eroded.  \n\nIn summary, the Guild Navigators are a **highly specialized, mutated faction** whose mastery of space travel once made them indispensable rulers of commerce and transit. Though now under the control of the Honored Matres, their prescience and reliance on melange keep them at the heart of interstellar dynamics, even as they pose risks to those seeking to evade their foresight.\",7\n680,EDRIC,\"**Edric** is a powerful and enigmatic **Guild Navigator**—also referred to as a **Guild Steersman** or **Guild Steersman-Ambassador**—deeply entrenched in the political conspiracies of the empire. A key conspirator against **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)**, Edric plays multiple roles in the machinations surrounding Paul’s rule, leveraging his prescient abilities, which are sustained by **melange (spice)**.\n\nEdric is involved in a **tense dialogue with Paul**, probing the limits of his godlike status and prescience, while simultaneously **shielding the conspiracy** from Paul’s foresight. He serves as both an ambassador and a provocateur, engaging in **manipulative conversations** that test Paul’s tolerance and potentially incite dissent among his followers. Notably, Edric **presents the ghola as a \"\"gift\"\" to Paul**, a calculated move tied to broader political schemes.  \n\nHis involvement extends to **persuading Princess Irulan** to join the conspiracy, showcasing his strategic and persuasive nature. However, his understanding of the full implications of these plots is **limited**, suggesting a degree of shortsightedness despite his power.  \n\nEdric is also **instrumental in the search for Lucilla on Gammu**, further highlighting his influence in covert operations. His **distinctive appearance**, marked by immersion in **melange gas**, underscores his otherworldly nature as a Navigator.  \n\nIn summary, Edric is a **mysterious, politically astute, and highly influential figure** whose actions are driven by the Guild’s interests, melange dependency, and a complex interplay of manipulation and foresight.

Additionally, Edric is involved in the intricate political dynamics surrounding the **ghola**, further highlighting the Guild’s vested interest in manipulating power structures for its own ends.  \n\nCollectively, Edric embodies the Guild’s dual nature: a technologically advanced entity dependent on spice, and a shrewd political player maneuvering behind the scenes.
