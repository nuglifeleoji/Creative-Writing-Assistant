He plays a significant role in worship practices at the broken temple and is involved in rituals that include food offerings, providing guidance to villagers on these spiritual matters.\n\nIn addition to his leadership in temple activities, 刘玉升 is known for his healing abilities, treating illnesses and providing assistance to individuals like 孙玉厚 and his wife. His reputation as a folk healer has made him a sought-after figure in the surrounding villages, where he has gained financial stability through his practices, including palm reading and fortune-telling.\n\nHowever, 刘玉升's influence is not without controversy.
