没地方住，白白在人家门上住了好几年。以后虽说他们把家搬到了这里，但少平和兰香晚上没地方住，还不是在人家那里借宿！再说，平时金秀对兰香，金波对少平，经常拿吃拿喝的，金波他妈也对这两个孩子没少操过心——两个念书娃娃的制服少安妈不会做，还不是金波他妈在他们家的缝纫机上给做吗？人家对他们这样好，他们又给人家回报不上什么。除过分粮分土豆和一些重劳动活他们能带上忙外，其余就只是他们沾人家的光了。现在，他们又要开口向人家借这么多的钱，而且不能肯定什么时候还人家……真难开口啊！ \n　　但没有办法。为了使儿子的婚事体面一些，他们只有这一条路可走。孙玉厚当晚决定，他第二天就去金俊海家借钱——他们唯一担心的是，俊海不在家，借这么大一笔钱，金波他妈敢不敢承担……钱的事拉完后，鸡已经叫了两遍，但为儿子婚事操心的两位老人，还是睡不着。他们又从被窝里伸出胳膊，扳着手指头计算了半天应待的客人：少安的两个姨家和三个舅家这不必说，婚丧事娘舅亲向来都是上宾；兰花一家；玉亭一家；金俊海一家；大队的领导人，村里和孙玉厚、少安相好的村民；少安在公社当文书的同学刘根民；当然还要请润叶——不管人家顾上顾不上回村来……现在，孙玉厚坐在金俊海家的椅子上，一边抽旱烟，一边忍不住打着哈欠，等着俊海两口子回家来。他想了半天，准备拐弯抹角地开口向俊海借钱，但又觉得没必要。还是直截了当说吧！弯拐来拐去，最后还不是向人家借钱吗？ \n　　孙玉厚坐在这里，心里忍不住感慨万端：十五年前，他为弟弟的婚事，就是这样难肠地到别人门上去借钱。十五年后的今天，他又为儿子的婚事来向别人借钱了，庄稼人的生活啊，什么时候才能有个改变呢？ \n　　唉，如果就按现在这样一村人在一个锅里搅稠稀，这光景还会一年不如一年的！庄稼人现在谁有心劲受苦？反正一天把工分混上就行了——因为你就是挣命劳动，到头来还不是和耍奸溜滑的人一样分粮分红吗？谁愿意再当这号瓷脑？ \n　　不一刻，金俊海夫妇把汽车上的东西搬回家来，搁在旁边窑里，就赶忙过他这边来了。俊海很快给他递上一根纸烟。玉厚推让着说：“我还是抽旱烟。纸烟抽不惯，一抽就咳嗽。”
