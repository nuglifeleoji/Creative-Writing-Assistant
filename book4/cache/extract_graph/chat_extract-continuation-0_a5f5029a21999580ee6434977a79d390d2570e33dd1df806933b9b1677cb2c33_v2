\n　　顾养民很有礼貌地回答说：“是一个班的，阿姨。”“这就是润生他爸。”爱云指着田福堂说。她然后又告诉大哥，这是顾老先生的孙子，和润生一个班。 \n　　顾养民亲热地过来叫了一声田叔叔。 \n　　田福堂问顾养民：“我润生在学校怎样？” \n　　顾养民当然不好说其它的，就说：“都好着哩！”“你好好帮助他！那娃娃慌慌张张的……你下午去不去学校？”他问顾老先生的孙子。 \n　　“去哩。” \n　　“那你叫润生晚上回他二妈家来，你给他说我来了……”顾养民满口答应说他一定把话给润生捎到。 \n　　田福堂随后提了几包顾老先生开的中药，就先回爱云家去了。 \n　　他在爱云家住了一个晚上，和徐国强把话拉到实在没什么可说的程度，第二天吃完早饭就骑着车子往回走了。原来他估计在城里得多呆几天，但事情很快都办完了。给爱云吩咐了润叶的事；让顾老先生看了气管炎；又和徐国强老汉拉完了话；加上福军也不在，他就再没心思在县城继续逗留。 \n　　临近中午时分，田福堂就骑着车子回到了石圪节。
