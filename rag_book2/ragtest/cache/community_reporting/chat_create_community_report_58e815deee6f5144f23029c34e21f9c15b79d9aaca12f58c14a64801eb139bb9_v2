He is primarily associated with the long-standing investigation into the murder of **桐原洋介**, the owner of a pawnshop, and the interconnected cases involving **桐原亮司** and **唐泽雪穗**, which span nearly two decades.  \n\nInitially assigned to **桐原洋介's murder case**, 笹垣 meticulously examines testimonies, including that of a young boy, and suspects the involvement of a child. Over the years, he becomes increasingly convinced that **亮司** and **雪穗** are central figures in the crime, maintaining contact with **筱冢一成** to uncover the truth. His investigation extends to related cases, such as the disappearance of detective **今枝** and the death of **寺崎忠夫**, where he demonstrates his ability to connect seemingly disparate events.  \n\n笹垣 is portrayed as a persistent and skeptical officer, often revisiting old leads and questioning alibis, including those of **亮司**, his mother **弥生子**, and **松浦**. He suspects **弥生子** and **松浦** of having an illicit relationship and harbors deep suspicions about **雪穗**, even warning others against marrying her due to her potential involvement in criminal activities.  \n\nAfter retiring, 笹垣 continues to assist in investigations, particularly those tied to **雪穗** and **亮司**, whom he has pursued for 19 years. He frequents **弥生子's bar**, subtly probing for information, and remains haunted by the unsolved aspects of the pawnshop murder, believing the true culprit was never apprehended. His dedication culminates in witnessing **亮司's death**, a pivotal moment in the case.  \n\n笹垣's career reflects a blend of traditional policing and psychological insight, making him a key figure in unraveling the complex web of crimes tied to **亮司** and **雪穗**.

He places a strong emphasis on evidence collection, maintaining a cautious and reserved attitude toward speculative theories, as seen in his interactions with colleagues like **笹垣**, whose deductions he reviews critically. While he listens to reports and input from his team, he prioritizes concrete proof over unverified hypotheses, underscoring his disciplined and detail-oriented investigative style.  \n\nBalancing leadership with analytical rigor, **中冢** embodies a composed yet assertive figure in the investigative process, guiding his team with a focus on thoroughness and precision. His role as the case's central coordinator highlights his ability to manage complex inquiries while upholding procedural integrity.  \n\n*(Word count: 199)*\",4\n446,新宿,\"**新宿** is a bustling commercial and administrative district in Tokyo, known for its vibrant atmosphere and diverse attractions.
