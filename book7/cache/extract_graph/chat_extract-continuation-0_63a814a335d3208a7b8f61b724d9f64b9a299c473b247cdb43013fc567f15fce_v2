在自己的位子坐下后，他探头看着桌下，取出放在那里的几本档案夹。里面的东西和授课内容完全无关，是他针对某个数学难题，这几年\n\n研究出来的部分成果。\n    把档案夹塞进包包后，他走出办公室。\n  \n\n    “之前我不也说过吗？所谓的考察，就是思考之后仔细省察所得到的结论。如果只因为实验得到预期的结果就感到庆幸，那纯粹只是感想\n\n。更何况，本来就不可能完全如你所预期。我希望你能从实验中自己去发现一些道理。总之你好好想一想再重写。”\n    汤川难得发脾气。他把报告塞回给悄然肃立的学生，然后大大摇头。学生鞠个躬，走出研究室。\n    “没想到你也会生气”草S说。\n    “我没有生气。只是看学生的做法太草率，所以指导一下。”汤川起身，开始拿马克杯冲泡即溶咖啡。“喂，后来查出了什么吗？”\n    “我查了石神的不在场证明。应该说，我直接去问了他本人。”\n    “正面攻击吗？”汤川拿着大大的马克杯，背对着流理台。“那么，他有何反应？”\n    “他说那晚一直在家。”\n    汤川皱起脸，摇摇头。\n    “我是在问你他有何反应，不是问你他怎么回答。”\n    “反应啊……看起来倒也不慌张。大概是听说刑警来了，在某种程度上已经先做好心理准备了。”\n    “对于你打听不在场证明的举动，他看起来像是有所疑问吗？”\n    “不，他没问我理由，况且我也不是开门见山地直接逼问。”\n    “以他的个性，说不定早就料到你们会问他不在场证明了。”汤川自言自语地说着，啜了一口咖啡。“他说那晚一直在家？”\n    “而且还说什么发了烧，所以隔天上午请假。”草S把从学校事务室拿来的石神出勤表往桌上一放。\n    汤川走过来，坐下，拿起出勤表。\n    “隔天上午……是吗？”\n    “犯案后，想必有很多事需要善后处理，所以才无法去学校。”\n    “那便当店小姐那边呢？”\n    “当然也仔细查过了。十一号，花冈靖子像平时一样上班。顺便说出来供你参考，她女儿也照常上学，甚至没迟到。”\n    汤川把出勤表放回桌上，双臂交抱。\n    “所谓的善后处理，到底需要做些什么呢？”\n    “那当然是扔掉凶器之类的。”\n    “做那种事需要耗费十个小时以上吗？”\n    “为什么说十个小时以上？”\n    “因为犯案是在十号晚上。如果翌日上午请假，就表示善后处理需要十个小时以上。”\n    “大概是需要时间睡觉吧。”\n    “没有人犯案后在做完善后处理前睡觉的，而且就算真的因此没时间睡觉，也不会请假，照理说就算勉强硬撑也会去上班。”\n    “……大概是有什么理由\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>石神<|>PERSON<|>石神 is a
