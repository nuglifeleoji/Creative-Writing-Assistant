   “不会吧，我当然也会感冒。”\n    “您的意思是，只是凑巧是那天吗？”\n    “‘凑巧’是什么意思？对我来说那天没什么特别的。”\n    “说的也是。”草S盖起记事本，起身说道，“您这么忙还来打扰，真是不好意思。”\n    “是我不好意思，没帮上忙。”\n    “哪里，这样就足够了。”\n    两人一起走出会客室，石神决定送刑警到玄关。\n

 “是吗？那我静候佳音。”\n    “一定。”草S说着从正面玄关走出去。\n    石神回到走廊后，从窗口望着刑警的背影。草S正拿着手机说话，表情倒是看不清楚。\n    他在思考刑警前来调查不在场证明的意义，照理说应该有什么根据才会把矛头指向他。但那到底是什么根据？之前和草S见面时，他看起\n\n来不像有这种想法。\n    不过，就今天的质问听来，草S尚未察觉案情的本质，他感到草S还在距离真相很远的地方徘徊，那个刑警对于石神缺乏不在场证明，肯\n\n定以为逮到了他的小辫子。不过这样也好，到此为止都还在石神的计算之中。\n    问题是――\n    汤川学的脸孔倏然闪过，那个男人察觉到了什么地步？又打算把本案的真相揭发到什么程度？\n    前几天，靖子在电话中提到一件怪事。据说汤川去找她，问她对石神有什么想法。而且，他似乎连石神暗恋靖子的心事都看穿了。\n    石神回想和汤川的几次对话，但他完全不记得自己曾经迂回地泄露对她的情愫，那么又怎么会被那个物理学家发现？\n    石神转身，朝办公室迈步走去。半路上，和那个男事务员在走廊相遇。\n    “咦？刑警先生呢？”\n    “好像没事了，刚刚才走。”\n    “石神老师还不回去吗？”\n    “对，我想起一点事要办。”\n    撇下似乎很想知道刑警问话内容的事务员，石神快步走回办公室。\n    在自己的位子坐下后，他探头看着桌下，取出放在那里的几本档案夹。里面的东西和授课内容完全无关，是他针对某个数学难题，这几\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
