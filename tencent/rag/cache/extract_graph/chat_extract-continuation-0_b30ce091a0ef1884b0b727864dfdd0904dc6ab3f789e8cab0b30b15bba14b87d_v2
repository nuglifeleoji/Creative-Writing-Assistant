They knew how the warp and weft created the fabric. A better word than Family, it was the fabric of the Bene Gesserit that formed the Sisterhood but it was the ancient instinct of Family that provided the warp.\nLucilla thought of her sisters only as Family now. The Family needed what she carried.\n| was a fool to seek refuge on Gammu!\nBut her damaged no-ship would limp no farther. How diabolically extravagant Honored Matres had been! The hatred this implied terrified her.\nStrewing the escape lanes around Lampadas with deathtraps, the Foldspace perimeter seeded with small no- globes, each containing a field projector and a lasgun to fire\non contact. When the laser hit the Holzmann generator in the no-globe, a chain reaction released the nuclear energy. Bzzz into the trap field and a devastating explosion spread silently across you. Costly but efficient! Enough such explosions and even a giant Guildship would become a crippled derelict in the void. Her ship’s system of defensive analyses had penetrated the nature of the trap only when it was too late, but she had been lucky, she supposed.\nShe did not feel lucky as she looked out the second-story window of this isolated Gammu farmhouse. The window was open and an afternoon breeze carried the inevitable smell of oil, something dirty in the smoke of a fire out there. The Harkonnens had left their oily mark on this planet so deep it might never be removed.\nHer contact here was a retired Suk doctor but she knew him as much more, something so secret that only a limited number in the Bene Gesserit shared it. The knowledge lay in a special classification: The secrets of which we do not speak, even among ourselves, for that would harm us. The secrets we do not pass from Sister to Sister in the sharing of lives for there is no open path. The secrets we dare not know until a need arises. Lucilla had stumbled into it because of a veiled remark by Odrade.\n“You know an interesting thing about Gammu? Mmmmm, there’s a whole society there that bands itself on the basis that they all eat consecrated foods. A custom brought in by immigrants who have never been assimilated. Keep to themselves, frown on outbreeding, that sort of thing. They ignite the usual mythic detritus, of course: whispers, rumors. Serves to isolate them even more. Precisely what they want.”\nLucilla knew of an ancient society that fitted itself neatly into this description. She was curious. The society she had in mind supposedly had died out shortly after the Second Inter-space Migrations. Judicious browsing in Archives whetted her curiosity even more. Living styles, rumor-\nfogged descriptions of religious rituals—especially the candelabra—and the keeping of special holy days with a proscription against any work on those days. And they were not just on Gammu!\nOne morning, taking advantage of an uncommon lull, Lucilla entered the workroom to test her “projective surmise,” something not as reliable as a Mentat’s equivalent but more than theory.\n“You have a new assignment for me, | Suspect.”\n“I see you’ve been spending time in Archives.”\n“It seemed a profitable thing to do just now.”\n“Making connections?”\n“A surmise.” That secret society on Gammu—they’re Jews, aren't they?\n“You may have need of special information because of where we are about to post you.” Extremely casual.\nLucilla sank into Bellonda’s chairdog without invitation.\nOdrade picked up a stylus, scribbled on a sheet of disposable and passed it to Lucilla in a way that hid it from the comeyes.\nLucilla took the hint and bent over the message, holding it close beneath the shield of her head.\n“Your surmise is correct. You must die before revealing it. That is the price of their cooperation, a mark of great trust.” Lucilla shredded the message.\nOdrade used eye and palm identification to unseal a panel on the wall behind her. She removed a small ridulian crystal and handed it to Lucilla. It was warm but Lucilla felt a chill. What could be so secret? Odrade swung the security hood from beneath her worktable and pivoted it into position.\nLucilla dropped the crystal into its receptacle with a trembling hand and pulled the hood over her head. Immediately, words formed in her mind, an oral sense of extremely old accents clipped for recognition: “The people to whom your attention has been called are the Jews. They\nmade a defensive decision eons ago. The solution to recurrent pogroms was to vanish from public view. Space travel made this not only possible but attractive. They hid on countless planets—their own Scattering—and they probably have planets where only their people live. This does not mean they have abandoned age-old practices in which they excelled out of survival necessity. The old religion is sure to persist even though somewhat altered. It is probable that a rabbi from ancient times would not find himself out of place behind the Sabbath menorah of a Jewish household in your age. But their secrecy is such that you could work a lifetime beside a Jew and never suspect. They call it ‘Complete Cover,’ although they know its dangers.”\nLucilla accepted this without question. That which was so secret would be perceived as dangerous by anyone who even suspected its presence. “E/se why do they keep it secret, eh? Answer me that!”\nThe crystal continued to pour its secrets into her awareness: “At the threat of discovery, they have a standard reaction, ‘We seek the religion of our roots. It is a revival, bringing back what is best from our past.’”\nLucilla knew this pattern. There were always “nutty revivalists.” It was guaranteed to blunt most curiosity. “Them? Oh, they’re another bunch of revivalists.”\n“The masking system (the crystal continued) did not succeed with us. We have our own well-recorded Jewish heritage and a fund of Other Memory to tell us reasons for secrecy. We did not disturb the situation until |], Mother Superior during and after the battle of Corrin (Very old, indeed!), saw that our Sisterhood had need of a secret society, a group responsive to our requests for assistance.”\nLucilla felt a surge of skepticism. Requests?\nThe long-ago Mother Superior had anticipated skepticism. “On occasion, we make demands they cannot avoid. But they make demands on us as well.”\nLucilla felt immersed in the mystique of this underground society. It was more than ultra-secret. Her clumsy questions in Archives had elicited mostly rejections. “Jews? What’s that? Oh, yes—an ancient sect. Look it up for yourself. We don’t have time for idle religious research.”\nThe crystal had more to impart: “Jews are amused and sometimes dismayed at what they interpret as our copying them. Our breeding records dominated by the female line to control the mating pattern are seen as Jewish. You are only a Jew if your mother was a Jew.”\nThe crystal came to its conclusion: “The Diaspora will be remembered. Keeping this secret involves our deepest honor.”\nLucilla lifted the hood from her head.\n“You are a very good choice for an extremely touchy assignment on Lampadas,” Odrade had said, restoring the crystal to its hiding place.\nThat is the past and likely dead. Look where Odrade’s “touchy assignment” has brought me!\nFrom her vantage in the Gammu farmhouse, Lucilla noted a large produce carrier had entered the grounds. There was a bustle of activity below her. Workers came from all sides to meet the big carrier with towbins of vegetables. She smelled the pungent juices from the cut stems of marrows.\nLucilla did not move from the window. Her host had supplied her with local garments—a long gown of drab gray everwear and a bright blue headscarf to confine her sandy hair. It was important to do nothing calling undue attention to herself. She had seen other women pause to watch the farm work. Her presence here could be taken as curiosity.\nIt was a large carrier, its suspensors laboring under the load of produce already piled in its articulated sections. The operator stood in a transparent house at the front, hands on the steering lever, eyes straight ahead. His legs were spread wide and he leaned into the web of sloping supports, touching the power bar with his left hip. He was a large\nman, face dark and deeply wrinkled, hair laced with gray. His body was an extension of the machinery—guiding ponderous movement. He flicked his gaze up to Lucilla as he passed, then back to the track into the wide loading area defined by buildings below her.\nBuilt into his machine, she thought. That said something about the way humans were fitted to the things they did. Lucilla sensed a weakening force in this thought. If you fitted yourself too tightly to one thing, other abilities atrophied. We become what we do.\nShe pictured herself suddenly as another operator in some great machine, no different from that man in the Carrier.\nThe big machine trundled past her out of the yard, its operator not sparing her another glance. He had seen her once. Why look twice?\nHer hosts had made a wise choice in this hiding place, she thought. A sparsely populated area with trustworthy workers in the immediate vicinity and little curiosity among the people who passed. Hard work dulled curiosity. She had noted the character of the area when she was brought here. Evening then and people already trudging toward their homes. You could measure the urban density of an area by when work stopped. Early to bed and you were in a loosely packed region. Night activity said people remained restless, twitchy with inner awareness of others active and vibrating too near.\nWhat has brought me to this introspective state?\nEarly in the Sisterhood’s first retreat, before the worst onslaughts of the Honored Matres, Lucilla had experienced difficulty coming to grips with belief that “someone out there is hunting us with intent to kill.”\nPogrom! That was what the Rabbi had called it before going off that morning “to see what | can do for you.”\nShe knew the Rabbi had chosen his word from long and bitter memory, but not since her first experience of Gammu\nbefore this pogrom had Lucilla felt such confinement to circumstances she could not control.\n| was a fugitive then, too.\nThe Sisterhood’s present situation bore similarities to what they had suffered under the Tyrant, except that the God Emperor obviously (in retrospect) never intended to exterminate the Bene Gesserit, only to rule them. And he certainly ruled!\nWhere is that damned Rabbi?\nHe was a large, intense man with old-fashioned spectacles. A broad face browned by much sunlight. Few wrinkles despite the age she could read in his voice and movements. The spectacles focused attention on deeply set brown eyes that watched her with peculiar intensity.\n“Honored Matres,” he had said (right here in this bare- walled upper room) when she explained her predicament. “Oh, my! That is difficult.”\nLucilla had expected that response and, what was more, she could see he knew it.\n“There is a Guild Navigator on Gammu helping the search for you,” he said. “It is one of the Edrics, very powerful, | am told.”\n“I have Siona blood. He cannot see me.”\n“Nor me nor any of my people and for the same reason. We Jews adjust to many necessities, you know.”\n“This Edric is a gesture,” she said. “He can do little.”\n“But they have brought him. I’m afraid there is no way we can get you Safely off the planet.”\n“Then what can we do?”\n“We will see. My people are not entirely helpless, you understand?”\nShe recognized sincerity and concern for her. He spoke quietly of resisting the sexual blandishments of Honored Matres, “doing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a secretive and powerful sisterhood with deep knowledge and influence, known for their breeding programs and political maneuvering>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a member of the Bene Gesserit, currently in hiding on Gammu, carrying important information for the Sisterhood>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is a planet with a history of Harkonnen influence, now a refuge for Lucilla and home to a secretive Jewish society>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and aggressive faction hunting the Bene Gesserit, known for their destructive tactics>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMPADAS<|>GEO<|>Lampadas is a planet where the Honored Matres set deathtraps, including no-globes with explosive devices>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit leader who provided Lucilla with critical information about the secret Jewish society>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive ancient society on Gammu and other planets, maintaining their traditions and identity through strict secrecy>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBI<|>PERSON<|>A leader within the Jewish society on Gammu, assisting Lucilla in her time of need>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD NAVIGATOR<|>PERSON<|>A powerful Navigator from the Spacing Guild, aiding in the search for Lucilla>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDRIC<|>PERSON<|>A specific Guild Navigator of great power, involved in the hunt for Lucilla>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A historically influential and oppressive family that left a lasting mark on Gammu>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Lucilla is a member of the Bene Gesserit, carrying out a critical mission for the Sisterhood<|>9>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>GAMMU<|>Lucilla is hiding on Gammu, seeking refuge from the Honored Matres<|>7>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Lucilla is being hunted by the Honored Matres<|>8>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>ODRADE<|>Odrade provided Lucilla with secret information and her current assignment<|>7>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>RABBI<|>The Rabbi is assisting Lucilla in her hiding and survival on Gammu<|>6>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>JEWS<|>The Bene Gesserit and the Jews have a secretive and cooperative relationship, sharing deep historical knowledge<|>6>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit are in conflict with the Honored Matres, who seek to exterminate them<|>9>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAMMU<|>HARKONNENS<|>Gammu bears the deep and lasting influence of the Harkonnens<|>7>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEWS<|>RABBI<|>The Rabbi is a leader within the Jewish society on Gammu<|>8>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUILD NAVIGATOR<|>EDRIC<|>Edric is a specific and powerful Guild Navigator involved in the search for Lucilla<|>8>)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
