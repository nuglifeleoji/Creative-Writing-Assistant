“能将前面的曲线打印出来吗？”汪淼问。沙瑞山抹了一把头上的冷汗，点点头，移动鼠标启动了打印程序。汪淼迫不及待地抓过激光打印机吐出的第一张纸。用一枝铅笔划过曲线，将波峰间的距离与他刚拿出来的那张莫尔斯电码表对照起来。\n　　短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短、长长长短短、长长短短长长、短短长长长、短短短短长、长长短短长长、短短短长长、长长短短短，这是1108:21:37。\n　　短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短，长长长短长长、短短短长长、长短短短短，这是1108:21:36。\n　　短长长长长、短长长长长、短短短短短、长长长短短、长长短短长长、短短长长长、短短短短长、长长短短长长、短短短长长、短短短短短，这是1108:21:35。\n　　……\n　　倒计时在宇宙尺度上继续，已经过去了78小时，还剩1108小时？
