年，渐渐地对这座城市有了热情——可是，他现在就要向这一切告别了。再见吧，原西。记得我初来之时，对你充满了怎样的畏怯和恐惧。现在当我要离开你的时候，不知为什么，又对你充满了如此的不舍之情！是的，你曾打开窗户，让我向外面的世界张望。你还用生硬的手拍打掉我从乡里带来的一身黄土，把你充满炭烟味的标志印烙在我的身上。老实说，你也没有能拍打净我身上的黄土；但我身上也的确烙下了你的印记。可以这样说，我还没有能变成一个纯粹的城里人，但也不完全是一个乡巴佬了。再见吧，亲爱的原西……孙少平怀着愉快而又伤感的情绪，用脚步，用心灵，一个下午回溯了自己两年的历程。 \n　　当他回到学校以后，见田晓霞正在他宿舍里。她显然是在等他。 \n　　“你到哪儿去了？”她问他。 \n　　“我出去走了走。”他说。 \n　　“现在咱们走吧！”她穿着一件带帽子的“棉猴”大衣，已经出了门。 \n　　他只好跟出来，问：“到哪儿去？” \n　　“我请你吃饭！”她说。 \n　　孙少平不愿到她家里去，就说：“我在大灶上报饭了……” \n　　“啊呀，都快毕业了，你还舍不得丢你那两个黑面馍？”她开玩笑说。 \n　　少平没吭声。其实，他今天下午报的是白馍——他把几张“欧洲”票一直攒到了这几天。 \n　　少平原来以为晓霞让他到她家去吃饭，但她却把他引到了街上的国营食堂。万幸！ \n　　她把饭菜买齐后，对他说：“咱们就要分别了，我应该请你吃一顿饭。家里人多，这里咱们清静一点，还可以拉话。” \n　　少平第一次单独和一个女同学一块下馆子，因此他有点不好意思。好在晓霞是个大方姑娘，他们也熟悉，才使他心里不特别慌。他说：“我也应该请你一次。礼尚往来！”“别，”晓霞说，“等我回咱们双水村的时候，你在你家里请我吃一顿饭，也许更有意思！” \n　　“你会到双水村来吗？”少平问她。 \n　　“肯定会的！我还从没回去看大爹大妈呢！再说，就是没他们，我也会去看你的！你要是到县城来，也一定要来找我！行不行？” \n　　“行……” \n　　少平一边吃饭，一边心里非常激动地想：他竟然这么大方地和一个女的坐在一起吃饭，拉话，这简直不可思议！ \n　　话说回来，他也只有和晓霞在一起的时候，他这个年龄和女同学交往的羞怯心理，才不至于成为一种严重的障碍。他们常常象两个大人一样探讨一些“大问题”，这使他们的关系限定在友谊和严肃的范围内。 \n　　“毕业后你准备怎办呀？”晓霞一边给他碗里扒拉菜，一边问他。 \n　　“一切都\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
