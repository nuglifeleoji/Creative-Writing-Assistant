Dune did not really answer those questions: it merely raised new questions which Leto and the Sisterhood may attempt to answer over the next five hundred generations.\n—THE DUNE CATASTROPHE AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\nhe bare brown rocks of the Shield Wall loomed in the\ndistance, visible to Ghanima as the embodiment of that apparition which threatened her future. She stood at the edge of the roof garden atop the Keep, the setting sun at her back. The sun held a deep orange glow from intervening dust clouds, a color as rich as the rim of a worm’s mouth. She sighed, thinking: Alia... Alia . . . IS your fate to be my fate?\nThe inner lives had grown increasingly clamorous of late. There was something about female conditioning in a Fremen society—perhaps it was a real sexual difference, but whatever—the female was more susceptible to that inner tide. Her grandmother had warned about it as they’d schemed, drawing on the accumulated wisdom of the Bene Gesserit but awakening that wisdom’s threats within Ghanima.\n“Abomination,” the Lady Jessica had said, “our term for the pre-born, has a long history of bitter experiences behind it. The way of it seems to be that the inner lives divide. They split into the benign and the malignant. The benign remain\ntractable, useful. The malignant appear to unite in one powerful psyche, trying to take over the living flesh and its consciousness. The process is known to take considerable time, but its signs are well known.”\n“Why did you abandon Alia?” Ghanima asked.\n“I fled in terror of what I’d created,” Jessica said, her voice low. “I gave up. And my burden now is that... perhaps | gave up too soon.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I cannot explain yet, but... maybe... no! lIl not give you false hopes. Ghafla, the abominable distraction, has a long history in human mythology. It was called many things, but chiefly it was called possession. That’s what it seems to be. You lose your way in the malignancy and it takes possession of you.”\n“Leto... feared the spice,” Ghanima said, finding that she could talk about him quietly. The terrible price demanded of them!\n“And wisely,” Jessica had said. She would say no more.\nBut Ghanima had risked an explosion of her inner memories, peering past an odd blurred veil and futilely expanding on the Bene Gesserit fears. To explain what had befallen Alia did not ease it one bit. The Bene Gesserit accumulation of experience had pointed to a possible way out of the trap, though, and when Ghanima ventured the inner sharing, she first called upon the Mohalata, a partnership of the benign which might protect her.\nShe recalled that sharing as she stood in the sunset glow at the edge of the Keep’s roof garden. Immediately she felt the memory-presence of her mother. Chani stood there, an apparition between Ghanima and the distant cliffs.\n“Enter here and you will eat the fruit of the Zaqquum, the food of hell!” Chani said. “Bar this door, my daughter: it is your only safety.”\nThe inner clamor lifted itself around the vision and Ghanima fled, sinking her consciousness into the\nSisterhood’s Credo, reacting out of desperation more than trust. Quickly she recited the Credo, moving her lips, letting her voice rise to a whisper:\n“Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the ultimate unspoken commandment ts ‘Thou shalt not question!’ But we question. We break that commandment as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind’s deepest sense of creativity.”\nSlowly a sense of order returned to Ghanima’s thoughts. She felt her body trembling, though, and knew how fragile was this peace she had attained—and that blurring veil remained in her mind.\n“Leb Kamai,” she whispered. “Heart of my enemy, you Shall not be my heart.”\nAnd she called up a memory of Farad’n’s features, the saturnine young face with its heavy brows and firm mouth.\nHate will make me strong, she thought. /n hate, I can resist Alia’s fate.\nBut the trembling fragility of her position remained, and all she could think about was how much Farad’n resembled his uncle, the late Shaddam IV.\n“Here you are!”\nIt was Irulan coming up from Ghanima’s right, striding along the parapet with movements reminiscent of a man. Turning, Ghanima thought: And she’s Shaddam’s daughter.\n“Why will you persist in sneaking out alone?” Irulan demanded, stopping in front of Ghanima and towering over her with a scowling face.\nGhanima refrained from saying that she was not alone, that guards had seen her emerge onto the roof. Irulan’s\nanger went to the fact that they were in the open here and that a distant weapon might find them.\n“You're not wearing a stillsuit,” Ghanima said. “Did you know that in the old days someone caught outside the sietch without a stillsuit was automatically killed. To waste water was to endanger the tribe.”\n“Water! Water!” Irulan snapped. “I want to know why you endanger yourself this way. Come back inside. You make trouble for all of us.”\n“What danger is there now?” Ghanima asked. “Stilgar has purged the traitors. Alia’s guards are everywhere.”\nlrulan peered upward at the darkening sky. Stars were already visible against a grey-blue backdrop. She returned her attention to Ghanima. “I won’t argue. | was sent to tell you we have word from Farad’n. He accepts, but for some reason he wishes to delay the ceremony.”\n“How long?”\n“We don’t know yet. It’s being negotiated. But Duncan is being sent home.”\n“And my grandmother?”\n“She chooses to stay on Salusa for the time being.”\n“Who can blame her?” Ghanima asked.\n“That silly fight with Alia!”\n“Don’t try to gull me, Irulan! That was no silly fight. I’ve heard the stories.”\n“The Sisterhood’s fears—”\n“Are real,” Ghanima said. “Well, you’ve delivered your message. Will you use this opportunity to have another try at dissuading me?”\n“I’ve given up.”\n“You should know better than to try lying to me,” Ghanima said.\n“Very well! l'Il keep trying to dissuade you. This course is madness.” And Irulan wondered why she let Ghanima become so irritating. A Bene Gesserit didn’t need to be irritated at anything. She said: “I’m concerned by the\nextreme danger to you. You know that. Ghani, Ghani... you're Paul’s daughter. How can you—”\n“Because I’m his daughter,” Ghanima said. “We Atreides go back to Agamemnon and we know what’s in our blood. Never forget that, childless wife of my father. We Atreides have a bloody history and we're not through with the blood.”\nDistracted, Irulan asked: “Who’s Agamemnon?”\n“How sparse your vaunted Bene Gesserit education proves itself,” Ghanima said. “I keep forgetting that you\nforeshorten history. But my memories go back to...” She broke off; best not to arouse those shades from their fragile Sleep.\n“Whatever you remember,” Irulan said, “you must know how dangerous this course is to—”\n“PI kill him,” Ghanima said. “He owes me a life.”\n“And l'Il prevent it if | can.”\n“We already know this. You won’t get the opportunity. Alia is sending you south to one of the new towns until after it’s done.”\nlrulan shook her head in dismay. “Ghani, | took my oath that I’d guard you against any danger. l'Il do it with my own life if necessary. If you think I’m going to languish in some brickwalled djedida while you...”\n“There’s always the Huanui,” Ghanima said, speaking softly. “We have the deathstill as an alternative. I’m sure you couldn’t interfere from there.”\nlrulan paled, put a hand to her mouth, forgetting for a moment all of her training. It was a measure of how much care she had invested in Ghanima, this almost complete abandonment of everything except animal fear. She spoke out of that shattering emotion, allowing it to tremble on her lips. “Ghani, | don’t fear for myself. I’d throw myself into the worm’s mouth for you. Yes, I’m what you call me, the childless wife of your father, but you’re the child | never\nhad. | beg you...” Tears glistened at the corners of her eyes.\nGhanima fought down a tightness in her throat, said: “There is another difference between us. You were never Fremen. I’m nothing else. This is a chasm which divides us. Alia knows. Whatever else she may be, she knows this.”\n“You can’t tell what Alia knows,” Irulan said, speaking bitterly. “If | didn’t know her for Atreides, I’d swear she has set herself to destroy her own Family.”\nAnd how do you know she’s still Atreides? Ghanima thought, wondering at this blindness in Irulan. This was a Bene Gesserit, and who knew better than they the history of Abomination? She would not let herself even think about it, let alone believe it. Alia must have worked some witchery on this poor woman.\nGhanima said: “| owe you a water debt. For that, l'Il guard your life. But your cousin’s forfeit. Say no more of that.”\nlrulan stilled the trembling of her lips, wiped her eyes. “1 did love your father,” she whispered. “I didn’t even know it until he was dead.”\n“Perhaps he isn’t dead,” Ghanima said. “This Preacher...”\n“Ghani! Sometimes | don’t understand you. Would Paul attack his own family?”\nGhanima shrugged, looked out at the darkening sky. “He might find amusement in such a—”\n“How can you speak so lightly of this—”\n“To keep away the dark depths,” Ghanima said. “I don’t taunt you. The gods know | don’t. But I’m just my father’s daughter. I’m every person who’s contributed seed to the Atreides. You won’t think of Abomination, but I can’t think of anything else. I’m the pre-born. | know what’s within me.”\n“That foolish old superstition about—”\n“Don’t!” Ghanima reached a hand toward Irulan’s mouth. “I’m every Bene Gesserit of their damnable breeding program up to and including my grandmother. And I’m very\nmuch more.” She tore at her left palm, drawing blood with a fingernail. “This is a young body, but its experiences... Oh, gods, Irulan! My experiences! No!” She put out her hand once more as Irulan moved closer. “I Know all of those futures which my father explored. I’ve the wisdom of so many lifetimes, and all the ignorance, too... all the", "’t taunt you. The gods know | don’t. But I’m just my father’s daughter.

I’ve the wisdom of so many lifetimes, and all the ignorance, too... all the frailties. If you’d help me, Irulan, first learn who | am.”\nInstinctively Irulan bent and gathered Ghanima into her arms, holding her close, cheek against cheek.\nDon’t let me have to kill this woman, Ghanima thought. Don’t let that happen.\nAs this thought swept through her, the whole desert passed into night.\nOne small bird has called thee From a beak streaked crimson. It cried once over Sietch Tabr\nAnd thou went forth unto Funeral Plain.\n—LAMENT FOR LETO Il\nBae awoke to the tinkle of water rings in a woman’s hair. He looked to the open doorway of his cell and saw Sabiha sitting there. In the half-immersed awareness of the spice he saw her outlined by all that his vision revealed about her. She was two years past the age when most Fremen women were wed or at least betrothed. Therefore her family was saving her for something ... or someone. She was nubile... obviously. His vision-shrouded eyes saw her as a creature out of humankind’s Terranic past: dark hair and pale skin, deep sockets which gave her blue-in-blue eyes a greenish cast. She possessed a small nose and a wide mouth above a sharp chin. And she was a living signal to him that the Bene Gesserit plan was known—or suspected— here in Jacurutu. So they hoped to revive Pharaonic Imperialism through him, did they? Then what was their design to force him into marrying his sister? Surely Sabiha could not prevent that.\nHis captors knew the plan, though. And how had they learned it? They’d not shared its vision. They’d not gone with him where life became a moving membrane in other dimensions. The reflexive and circular subjectivity of the visions which revealed Sabiha were his and his alone.\nAgain the water rings tinkled in Sabiha’s hair and the sound stirred up his visions. He knew where he had been and what he had learned. Nothing could erase that. He was\nnot riding a great Maker palanquin now, the tinkle of water rings among the passengers a rhythm for their passage songs. No. ... He was here in the cell of Jacurutu, embarked on that most dangerous of all journeys: away from and back to the Ah/ as-sunna wal-jamas, from the real world of the senses and back to that world.\nWhat was she doing there with the water rings tinkling in her hair? Oh, yes. She was mixing more of the brew which they thought held him captive: food laced with spice essence to keep him half in and half out of the real universe until either he died or his grandmother’s plan succeeded. And every time he thought he’d won, they sent him back. The Lady Jessica was right, of course—that old witch! But what a thing to do. The total recall of all those lives within him was of no use at all until he could organize the data and remember it at will. Those lives had been the raw stuff of anarchy. One or all of them could have overwhelmed him. The spice and its peculiar setting here in Jacurutu had been a desperate gamble.\nNow Gurney waits for the sign and | refuse to give it to him. How long will his patience last?\nHe stared out at Sabiha. She’d thrown her hood back and revealed the tribal tattoos at her temples. Leto did not recognize the tattoos at first, then remembered where he was. Yes, Jacurutu still lived.\nLeto did not know whether to be thankful toward his grandmother or hate her. She wanted him to have conscious-level instincts. But instincts were only racial memories of how to handle crises. His direct memories of those other lives told him far more than that. He had it all organized now, and could see the peril of revealing himself to Gurney. No way of keeping the revelation from Namri. And Namri was another problem.\nSabiha entered the cell with a bowl in her hands. He admired the way the light from outside made rainbow circles at the edges of her hair. Gently she raised his head\nand began feeding him from the bowl. It was only then he realized how weak he was. He allowed her to feed him while his mind went roving, recalling the session with Gurney and Namri. They believed him! Namri more than Gurney, but even Gurney could not deny what his senses had already reported to him about the planet.\nSabiha wiped his mouth with a hem of her robe.\nAhhh, Sabiha, he thought, recalling that other vision which filled his heart with pain. Many nights have | dreamed beside the open water, hearing the winds pass overhead. Many nights my flesh lay beside the snake’s den and | dreamed of Sabiha in the summer heat. | saw her storing spice-bread baked on red-hot sheets of plasteel. | saw the clear water in the qanat, gentle and shining, but a stormwind ran through my heart. She sips coffee and eats. Her teeth shine in the shadows. | see her braiding my water rings into her hair. The amber fragrance of her bosom strikes through to my innermost senses. She torments me and oppresses me by her very existence.\nThe pressure of his multi-memories exploded the time- frozen englobement which he had tried to resist. He felt twining bodies, the sounds of sex, rhythms laced in every sensory impression: lips, breathing, moist breaths, tongues. Somewhere in his vision there were helix shapes, coal- colored, and he felt the beat of those shapes as they turned within him. A voice pleaded in his skull: “Please, please, please, please...” There was an adult beefswelling in his loins and he felt his mouth open, holding, clinging to the girder-shape of ecstasy. Then a sigh, a lingering groundswelling sweetness, a collapse.\nOh, how sweet to let that come into existence!\n“Sabiha,” he whispered. “Oh, my Sabiha.”\nWhen her charge had clearly gone deeply into the trance after his food, Sabiha took the bowl and left, pausing at the doorway to speak to Namri. “He called my name again.”\n“Go back and stay with him,” Namri said. “I must find Halleck and discuss this with him.”\nSabiha deposited the bowl beside the doorway and returned to the cell. She sat on the edge of the cot, staring at Leto’s shadowed face.\nPresently he opened his eyes and put a hand out, touching her cheek. He began to talk to her then, telling her about the vision in which she had lived.\nShe covered his hand with her own as he spoke. How sweet he was... how very swee— She sank onto the cot, cushioned by his hand, unconscious before he pulled the hand away. Leto sat up, feeling the depths of his weakness. The spice and its visions had drained him. He searched through his cells for every spare spark of energy, climbed from the cot without disturbing Sabiha. He had to go, but he knew he’d not get far. Slowly he sealed his stillsuit, drew the robe around him, slipped through the passage to the outer shaft. There were a few people about, busy at their own affairs. They knew him, but he was not their responsibility. Namri and Halleck would know what he was doing; Sabiha could not be far away.\nHe found the kind of side passage he needed and walked boldly down it.\nBehind him Sabiha slept peacefully until Halleck roused her.\nShe sat up, rubbed her eyes, saw the empty cot, saw her uncle standing behind Halleck, the anger on their faces.\nNamri answered the expression on her face: “Yes, he’s gone.”\n“How could you let him escape?” Halleck raged. “How is this possible?”\n“He was seen going toward the lower exit,” Namri said, his voice oddly calm.\nSabiha cowered in front of them, remembering.\n“How?” Halleck demanded.\n“I don’t know. | don’t know.”\n“It’s night and he’s weak,” Namri said. “He won’t get far.” Halleck whirled on him. “You want the boy to die!”\n“It wouldn’t displease me.”\nAgain Halleck confronted Sabiha. “Tell me what\nhappened.” “He touched my cheek. He kept talking about his vision... . us together.” She looked down at the empty cot.\n“He made me sleep. He put some magic on me.”\nHalleck glanced at Namri. “Could he be hiding inside somewhere?”\n“Nowhere inside. He’d be found, seen. He was headed for the exit. He’s out there.”\n“Magic,” Sabiha muttered.\n“No magic,” Namri said. “He hypnotized her. Almost did it to me, you remember? Said | was his friend.”\n“He’s very weak,” Halleck said.\n“Only in his body,” Namri said. “He won’t go far, though. | disabled the heel pumps of his stillsuit. He’ll die with no water if we don’t find him.”\nHalleck almost turned and struck Namri, but held himself in rigid control. Jessica had warned him that Namri might have to kill the lad. Gods below! What a pass they’d come to, Atreides against Atreides. He said: “Is it possible he just wandered away in the spice trance?”\n“What difference does it make?” Namri asked. “If he escapes us he must die.”\n“We'll start searching at first light,” Halleck said. “Did he take a Fremkit?”\n“There’re always a few beside the doorseal,” Namri said. “He’d’'ve been a fool not to take one. Somehow he has never struck me as a fool.”\n“Then send a message to our friends,” Halleck said. “Tell them what’s happened.”\n“No messages this night,” Namri said. “There’s a storm coming. The tribes have been tracking it for three days now.\nIt'll be here by midnight. Already communication’s blanked out. The satellites signed off this sector two hours ago.”\nA deep sigh shook Halleck. The boy would die out there for sure if the sandblast storm caught him. It would eat the flesh from his bones and sliver the bones to fragments. The contrived false death would become real. He slapped a fist into an open palm. The storm could trap them in the sietch. They couldn’t even mount a search. And storm static had already isolated the sietch.\n“Distrans,” he said, thinking they might imprint a message onto a bat’s voice and dispatch it with the alarm.\nNamri shook his head. “Bats won't fly in a storm. Come on,", " a message to our friends,” Halleck said. “Tell them what’s happened.”\n“No messages this night,” Namri said. “There’s a storm coming. The tribes have been tracking it for three days now.\nIt'll be here by midnight. Already communication’s blanked out. The satellites signed off this sector two hours ago.”\nA deep sigh shook Halleck.

And storm static had already isolated the sietch.\n“Distrans,” he said, thinking they might imprint a message onto a bat’s voice and dispatch it with the alarm.\nNamri shook his head. “Bats won't fly in a storm. Come on, man. They're more sensitive than we are. They'll cower in the cliffs until it’s past. Best to wait for the satellites to pick us up again. Then we can try to find his remains.”\n“Not if he took a Fremkit and hid in the sand,” Sabiha said.\nCursing under his breath, Halleck whirled away from them, strode out into the sietch.\nPeace demands solutions, but we never reach living solutions; we only work toward them. A fixed solution is, by definition, a dead solution. The trouble with peace is that it tends to punish mistakes instead of rewarding brilliance.\n—THE WORDS OF MY FATHER: AN ACCOUNT OF MUAD’DIB RECONSTRUCTED BY HARQ AL-ADA\n4l he’s training him? She’s training Farad’n?”\nAlia glared at Duncan Idaho with a deliberate mix of anger and incredulity. The Guild heighliner had swung into orbit around Arrakis at noon local. An hour later the lighter had put Idaho down at Arrakeen, unannounced, but all casual and open. Within minutes a ‘thopter had deposited him atop the Keep. Warned of his impending arrival, Alia had greeted him there, coldly formal before her guards, but now they stood in her quarters beneath the north rim. He had just delivered his report, truthfully, precisely, emphasizing each datum in mentat fashion.\n“She has taken leave of her senses,” Alia said.\nHe treated the statement as a mentat problem. “All the indicators are that she remains well balanced, sane. | should say her sanity index was—”\n“Stop that!” Alia snapped. “What can she be thinking of?”\nIdaho, who knew that his own emotional balance depended now upon retreat into mentat coldness, said: “| compute she is thinking of her granddaughter’s betrothal.” His features remained carefully bland, a mask for the raging grief which threatened to engulf him. There was no Alia here. Alia was dead. For a time he’d maintained a myth-Alia before his senses, someone he’d manufactured out of his\nown needs, but a mentat could carry on such self-deception for only a limited time. This creature in human guise was possessed; a demon-psyche drove her. His steely eyes with their myriad facets available at will reproduced upon his vision centers a multiplicity of myth-Alias. But when he combined them into a single image, no Alia remained. Her features moved to other demands. She was a shell within which outrages had been committed.\n“Where’s Ghanima?” he asked.\nShe waved the question aside. “I’ve sent her with Irulan to stay in Stilgar’s keeping.”\nNeutral territory, he thought. There’s been another negotiation with rebellious tribes. She’s losing ground and doesn’t know it... or does she? Is there another reason? Has Stilgar gone over to her?\n“The betrothal,” Alia mused. “What are conditions in the Corrino House?”\n“Salusa swarms with outrine relatives, all working upon Farad’n, hoping for a share in his return to power.”\n“And she’s training him in the Bene Gesserit...”\n“Is it not fitting for Ghanima’s husband?”\nAlia smiled to herself, thinking of Ghanima’s adamant rage. Let Farad’n be trained. Jessica was training a corpse. It would all work out.\n“I must consider this at length,” she said. “You’re very quiet, Duncan.”\n“I await your questions.”\n“I see. You Know, | was very angry with you. Taking her to Farad’n!”\n“You commanded me to make it real.”\n“| was forced to put out the report that you’d both been taken captive,” she said.\n“| obeyed your orders.”\n“You're so literal at times, Duncan. You almost frighten me. But if you hadn’t, well...”\n“The Lady Jessica’s out of harm’s way,” he said. “And for Ghanima’s sake we should be grateful that—”\n“Exceedingly grateful,” she agreed. And she thought: He’s no longer trustworthy. He has that damnable Atreides loyalty. | must make an excuse to send him away... and have him eliminated. An accident, of course.\nShe touched his cheek.\nIdaho forced himself to respond to the caress, taking her hand and kissing it.\n“Duncan, Duncan, how sad it is,” she said. “But | cannot keep you here with me. Too much is happening and I’ve so few | can completely trust.”\nHe released her hand, waited.\n“I was forced to send Ghanima to Tabr,” she said. “Things are in deep unrest here. Raiders from the Broken Lands breached the ganats at Kagga Basin and spilled all of their waters into the sands. Arrakeen was on short rations. The Basin’s alive with sandtrout yet, reaping the water harvest. They’re being dealt with, of course, but we’re spread very thin.”\nHe’d already noted how few amazons of Alia’s guard were to be seen in the Keep. And he thought: The Maquis of the Inner Desert will keep on probing her defenses. Doesn’t she know that?\n“Tabr is still neutral territory,” she said. “Negotiations are continuing there right now. Javid’s there with a delegation from the Priesthood. But I'd like you at Tabr to watch them, especially Irulan.”\n“She /s Corrino,” he agreed.\nBut he saw in her eyes that she was rejecting him. How transparent this Alia-creature had become!\nShe waved a hand. “Go now, Duncan, before | soften and keep you here beside me. I’ve missed you so...”\n“And I’ve missed you,” he said, allowing all of his grief to flow into his voice.\nShe stared at him, startled by the sadness. Then: “For my sake, Duncan.” And she thought: Joo bad, Duncan. She said: “Zia will take you to Tabr. We need the ‘thopter back here.”\nHer pet amazon, he thought: / must be careful of that one.\n“I understand,” he said, once more taking her hand and kissing it. He stared at the dear flesh which once had been his Alia’s. He could not bring himself to look at her face as he left. Someone else stared back at him from her eyes.\nAs he mounted to the Keep’s roofpad, Idaho probed a growing sense of unanswered questions. The meeting with Alia had been extremely trying for the mentat part of him which kept reading data signs. He waited beside the ‘thopter with one of the Keep’s amazons, stared grimly southward. Imagination took his gaze beyond the Shield Wall to Sietch Tabr. Why does Zia take me to Tabr? Returning a ‘thopter is a menial task. What is the delay? Is Zia getting special instructions?\nIdaho glanced at the watchful guard, mounted to the pilot’s position in the ’thopter. He leaned out, said: “Tell Alia l'Il send the ‘thopter back immediately with one of Stilgar’s men.”\nBefore the guard could protest he closed the door and started the 'thopter. He could see her standing there indecisively. Who could question Alia’s consort? He had the ‘thopter airborne before she could make up her mind what to do.\nNow, alone in the 'thopter, he allowed his grief to spend itself in great wracking sobs. Alia was gone. They had parted forever. Tears flowed from his Tleilaxu eyes and he whispered: “Let all the waters of Dune flow into the sand. They will not match my tears.”\nThis was a non-mentat excess, though, and he recognized it as such, forcing himself to sober assessment of present necessities. The ‘thopter demanded his attention. The\nreactions of flying brought him some relief, and he had himself once more in hand.\nGhanima with Stilgar again. And Irulan.\nWhy had Zia been designated to accompany him? He made it a mentat problem and the answer chilled him. / was to have a fatal accident.\nThis rocky shrine to the skull of a ruler grants no prayers. It has become the grave of lamentations. Only the wind hears the voice of this place. The cries of night creatures and the passing wonder of two moons, all say his day has ended. No more supplicants come. The visitors have gone from the feast. How bare the pathway down this mountain.\n—LINES AT THE SHRINE OF AN ATREIDES DUKE ANON.\nhe thing had the deceptive appearance of simplicity to\nLeto: avoiding the vision, do that which has not been seen. He knew the trap in his thought, how the casual threads of a locked future twisted themselves together until they held you fast, but he had a new grip on those threads. Nowhere had he seen himself running from Jacurutu. The thread to Sabiha must be cut first.\nHe crouched now in the last daylight at the eastern edge of the rock which protected Jacurutu. His Fremkit had produced energy tablets and food. He waited now for strength. To the west lay Lake Azrak, the gypsum plain where once there’d been open water in the days before the worm. Unseen to the east lay the Bene Sherk, a scattering of new settlements encroaching upon the open bled. To the south lay the Tanzerouft, the Land of Terror: thirty-eight hundred kilometers of wasteland broken only by patches of grass-locked dunes and windtraps to water them—the work of the ecological transformation remaking the landscape of Arrakis. They were serviced by airborne teams and no one stayed for long.\nI| will go south, he told himself. Gurney will expect me to do that. This was not the moment to do the completely unexpected.\nIt would be dark soon and he could leave this temporary hiding place. He stared at the southern skyline. There was a whistling of dun sky along that horizon, rolling there like smoke, a burning line of undulant dust—a storm. He watched the high center of the storm rising up out of the Great Flat like a questing worm. For a full minute he watched the center, saw that it did not move to the right or the left. The old Fremen saying leaped into his mind: When the center does not move, you are in its path.\nThat storm changed matters.\nFor a moment he stared back westward the direction of Tabr, feeling the deceptive grey-tan peace of the desert evening, seeing the white gypsum pan edged by wind- rounded pebbles, the desolate emptiness with its unreal surface of glaring white reflecting dust clouds. Nowhere in any vision had he seen himself surviving the"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_010a94b790b927eef308a51389d429824c06d2a9971dd6c5efd115edb51cfc11_v2"}
