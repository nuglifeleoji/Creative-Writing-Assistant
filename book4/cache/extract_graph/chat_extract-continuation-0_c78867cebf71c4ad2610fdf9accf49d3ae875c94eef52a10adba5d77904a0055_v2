\n　　他家里只有一孔窑洞，挤着一家三辈人。至于少安现在住的那个小土窑，根本不能算个窑，只能算个放柴草的地方。怎么能让一对新人住在这样一个小土洞里呢？ \n　　那就只能又向别人借窑洞住了。这就是说，他，孙玉厚，又要象十五年前玉亭结婚时一样，得要去寄人篱下了。 \n　　唉，那时难是难，但他比现在年轻气盛，也不在乎这种穷折腾。可现在他老俩口先不说，少安他奶半瘫在炕上，大小便都不能自理；住在人家门上，肮肮脏脏的，怎么能行呢？ \n　　可是话又说回来，就是他乐意再搬迁一次，可谁家又有闲窑让他们去住呢！他们早年间住过俊海家的窑洞，可现在人家的孩子都已经大了，儿女各住一孔窑洞，另一孔闲窑又堆满了东西。再说，他的少平和兰香已经一年四季基本就住在人家家里——孩子大了再不能和父母亲同炕，自家人没地方，只好挤在人家那里。 \n　　村里大部分人家，没有几户住宿宽裕的。有个把人家倒有闲窑，可他们和这些人家交情不深，没办法开口。就是人家勉强让你住下，也别扭啊！ \n　　当然，闲在最多的是地主成份的金光亮弟兄几家。但他弟玉亭文革开始那年，带着贫下中农造反队在人家家里刨元宝和“变天帐”，把弟兄几家的院子挖了个稀巴烂，现在有什么脸再开口问人家借窑洞住呢？ \n　　孙玉厚一下子又陷入到无限的苦恼之中。他先前只忙着借钱借粮，没把这件最大的事当一回事！现在眼看婚期已到，这可怎么办呢？唉，对于农村穷家薄业的人来说，要娶一个儿媳妇，真不容易啊！幸亏秀莲还不要财礼钱，否则，这笔帐债他孙玉厚临死前都不一定能还完！ \n　　正在孙玉厚愁得束手无策的时候，少安已经把这问题解决了。 \n　　少安先是给副队长田福高诉说了他的难处。他本没指望福高能解决这困难。不料福高却让他别发愁，说这事有他哩！田福高当下把一队的一些主要劳力找来，和他们商量说，队长结婚没地方住，能不能把一队饲养室边那孔放籽种的窑洞，借给他住一两年？福高说籽种先可以倒腾到饲养员田万江住的窑洞。 \n　　大家一听是这事，都说：这有个啥哩！就让少安住去吧，三年五年都可以！饲养员田万江老汉还开玩笑说：“这下我也有个伴了。要不一个人住下，狼吃了都没人晓得！”田福高咧开大嘴对这个远门老哥说：“狼来了先吃牲灵呀，你那\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
