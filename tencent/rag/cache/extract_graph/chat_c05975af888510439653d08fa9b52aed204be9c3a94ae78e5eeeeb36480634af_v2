She had lost weight and her cheekbones stood out. Unguent did little to conceal cracks in her lips. Veins stood out on her hands. Her\neyes looked ancient and her expression was that of someone who had tasted bitter dregs.\n“I’ve been listening to you two,” she said. She dropped her hand from her hip and moved farther into the room. “How dare you speak of good will, father?”\nIdaho had noted the uniform. He pursed his lips in thought. Fish Speaker Command? Siona?\n“| understand your bitterness,” Moneo said. “I had similar feelings once.”\n“Did you really?” She came closer, stopping just beside Idaho, who continued to regard her with a look of speculation.\n“lam filled with joy to see you alive,” Moneo said.\n“How gratifying for you to see me safely into the God Emperor’s Service,” she said. “You waited so long to have a child and look! See how successful | am.” She turned slowly to display her uniform. “Commander of the Fish Speakers. A commander with a troop of one, but nonetheless a commander.”\nMoneo forced his voice to be cold and professional. “Sit down.”\n“| prefer to stand.” She looked down at Idaho’s upturned face. “Ahhh, Duncan Idaho, my intended mate. Don’t you find this interesting, Duncan? The Lord Leto tells me | will be fitted into the command structure of the Fish Speakers in time. Meanwhile, | have one attendant. Do you know the one called Nayla, Duncan?”\nIdaho nodded.\n“Really? | think perhaps | don’t know her.” Siona looked at Moneo. “Do | know her, father?”\nMoneo shrugged.\n“But you speak of trust, father,” Siona said. “Who does the powerful minister, Moneo, trust?”\nIdaho turned to see the effect of these words on the majordomo. The man’s face appeared brittle with repressed emotion. Anger? No... something else.\n“I trust the God Emperor,” Moneo said. “And, in the hope that it will teach both of you something, | am here to convey his wishes to you.”\n“His wishes!” Siona taunted. “Hear that, Duncan? The God Emperor’s commands are now wishes.”\n“Speak your piece,” Idaho said. “I know we have little choice in whatever it is.”\n“You always have a choice,” Moneo said.\n“Don’t listen to him,” Siona said. “He’s full of tricks. They expect us to fall into each other’s arms and breed more like my father. Your descendant, my father!”\nMoneo’s face went pale. He gripped the edge of his worktable with both hands and leaned forward. “You are both fools! But | will try to save you. In spite of yourselves, | will try to save you.”\nIdaho saw Moneo’s cheeks tremble, the intensity of the man’s stare, and felt oddly moved by this. “I’m not his stud, but l'Il listen to you.”\n“Always a mistake,” Siona said.\n“Be still, woman,” Idaho said.\nShe glared at the top of Idaho’s head. “Don’t address me that way or l'Il wrap your neck around your ankles!”\nIdaho stiffened and started to turn.\nMoneo grimaced and waved a hand for Idaho to remain seated. “I caution you, Duncan, that she could probably do it. |I am no match for her and you do recall your attempt at violence against me?”\nIdaho inhaled a deep, quick breath, let it out slowly, then: “Say what you have to Say.”\nSiona moved to perch at the end of Moneo’s table and looked down at both of them. “Much better,” she said. “Let him have his say, but don’t listen.”\nIdaho pressed his lips tightly together.\nMoneo released his grip on the edge of his desk. He sat back and looked from Idaho to Siona. “I have almost completed the arrangements for the God Emperor’s\nwedding to Hwi Noree. During those festivities, | want you both out of the way.”\nSiona turned a questioning look on Moneo. “Your idea or his?”\n“Mine!” Moneo returned his daughter’s glare. “Have you no sense of honor and duty? Have you learned nothing from being with him?”\n“Oh, | learned what you learned, father. And | gave my word, which | will keep.”\n“Then you'll command the Fish Speakers?”\n“Whenever he trusts me with command. You know, father, he’s ever so much more devious than you are.”\n“Where are you sending us?” Idaho asked.\n“Provided we agree to go,” Siona said.\n“There is a small village of Museum Fremen at the edge of the Sareer,” Moneo said. “It is called Tuono. The village is relatively pleasant. It’s in the shadow of the Wall with the river just beyond the Wall. There is a well and the food is good.”\nTuono? Idaho wondered. The name sounded familiar. “There was a Tuono Basin on the way to Sietch Tabr,” he said.\n“And the nights are long and there’s no entertainment,” Siona said.\nIdaho shot a sharp glance at her. She returned it. “He wants us breeding and the Worm satisfied,” she said. “He wants babies in my belly, new lives to warp and twist. I'll see him dead before I'll give him that!”\nIdaho looked back at Moneo with a bemused expression. “And if we refuse to go?”\n“I think you’ll go,” Moneo said.\nSiona’s lips twitched. “Duncan, have you even seen one of these little desert villages? No comforts, no...”\n“I have seen Tabur Village,” Idaho said.\n“I’m sure that is a metropolis beside Tuono. Our God Emperor would not celebrate his nuptials in any cluster of\nmud hovels! Oh, no. Tuono will be mud hovels and no amenities, as close to the original Fremen as possible.”\nIdaho kept his attention on Moneo while speaking: “Fremen did not live in mud huts.”\n“Who cares where they conducted their cultish games?” she sneered.\nStill looking at Moneo, Idaho said: “Real Fremen had only one cult, the cult of personal honesty. | worry more about honesty than about comfort.”\n“Don’t expect comfort from me!” Siona snapped.\n“| don’t expect anything from you,” Idaho said. “When would we leave for this Tuono, Moneo?”\n“You're going?” she asked.\n“lam considering an acceptance of your father’s kindness,” Idaho said.\n“Kindness!” She looked from Idaho to Moneo.\n“You would leave immediately,” Moneo said. “I have detailed a detachment of Fish Speakers under Nayla to escort you and provide for you at Tuono.”\n“Nayla?” Siona asked. “Really? Will she stay with us there?”\n“Until the day of the wedding.”\nSiona nodded slowly. “Then we accept.”\n“Accept for yourself!” Idaho snapped.\nSiona smiled. “Sorry. May | formally request that the great Duncan Idaho join me at this primitive garrison where he will keep his hands off my person?”\nIdaho peered up at her from under his brows. “Have no fears about where | will put my hands.” He looked at Moneo. “Are you being kind, Moneo? Is that why you’re sending me away?”\n“It’s a question of trust,” Siona said. “Who does he trust?”\n“Will | be forced to go with your daughter?” Idaho insisted.\nSiona stood. “We either accept or the troopers will bind us and carry us out in a most uncomfortable fashion. You can\nsee it in his face.”\n“So | really have no choice,” Idaho said.\n“You have the choice anyone has,” Siona said. “Die now or later.”\nStill, Idaho stared at Moneo. “Your real intentions, Moneo? Won't you satisfy my curiosity?”\n“Curiosity has kept many people alive when all else failed,” Moneo said. “I am trying to keep you alive, Duncan. | have never done that before.”\nIt required almost a thousand years before the dust of Dune’s old planet- wide desert left the atmosphere to be bound up in soil and water. The wind called sandblaster has not been seen on Arrakis for some twenty-five hundred years. Twenty billion tons of dust could be carried suspended in the wind of just one of those storms. The sky often had a silvery look to it then. Fremen said: “The desert is a surgeon cutting away the skin to expose what’s underneath.” The planet and the people had layers. You could see them. My Sareer is but a weak echo of what was. | must be the sandblaster today.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nae os sent them to Tuono without consulting me? How surprising of you, Moneo! You’ve not done such an independent thing in a long while.”\nMoneo stood about ten paces from Leto in the gloomy center of the crypt, head bowed, using every artifice he knew to keep from trembling, aware that even this could be seen and interpreted by the God Emperor. It was almost midnight. Leto had kept his majordomo waiting and waiting.\n“| pray | have not offended my Lord,” Moneo said.\n“You have amused me, but take no heart from that. Lately, | cannot separate the comic from the sad.”\n“Forgive me, Lord,” Moneo whispered.\n“What is this forgiveness you ask? Must you always require judgment? Can’t your universe merely be?”\nMoneo lifted his gaze to that awful cowled face. He is both ship and storm. The sunset exists in itself. Moneo felt that he stood on the brink of terrifying revelations. The God Emperor’s eyes bored into him, burning, probing. “Lord, what would you have of me?”\n“That you have faith in yourself.”\nFeeling that something might explode in him, Moneo said: “Then the fact that | did not consult you before .. .”\n“How enlightened of you, Moneo! Small souls who seek power over others first destroy the faith those others might have in themselves.”\nThe words were shattering to Moneo. He sensed accusation in them, confession. He felt his hold on a fearsome but infinitely desirable thing weakening. He tried to find words to call it back, but his mind remained blank. Perhaps if he asked the God Emperor...\n“Lord, if you would but tell me your thoughts on...”\n“My thoughts vanish on contact!”\nLeto stared down at Moneo. How strange were the majordomo’s eyes perched there above that hawkish Atreides nose—free-verse eyes in a metronome face. Did Moneo hear that rhythmic pulsebeat: Malky is coming! Malky is coming! Malky is coming!?\nMoneo wanted to cry out in anguish. The thing he had felt —all gone! He put both his hands over his mouth.\n“Your universe is a two-dimensional hourglass,” Leto accused. “Why do you try to hold back the sand?”\nMoneo lowered his hands and sighed. “Do you wish to hear about the wedding arrangements, Lord?”\n“Don’t be tiresome! Where is Hwi?”\n“The Fish Speakers are preparing her for...”\n“Have you consulted her about the arrangements?”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“She approved?”\n“Yes, Lord, but she accused me of living for the quantity of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c05975af888510439653d08fa9b52aed204be9c3a94ae78e5eeeeb36480634af_v2"}
