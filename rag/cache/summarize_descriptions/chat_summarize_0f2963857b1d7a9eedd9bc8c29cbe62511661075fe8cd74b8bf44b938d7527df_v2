It is a secure facility with restricted areas, including Forbidden Windows, and is where Duncan learns his history before being sent elsewhere. Miles Teg meets with Schwangyu here and obtains a modern lasgun. The Keep also houses Teg, Lucilla, and Duncan at times, functioning as a residence and training ground.  \n\nOn **Arrakis (Dune)**, the Keep is Paul Atreides' former fortress-stronghold in Arrakeen, serving as a center of power, governance, and official ceremonies. It contains private and secure areas, monitors threats like Sardaukar infiltrators, and is near the Temple. Duncan Idaho is deposited here by 'thopter, and Ghanima is seen standing atop it, overlooking the Shield Wall.  \n\nThere are conflicting references to the Keep being on **Rakis** (a later name for Arrakis) during Bene Gesserit negotiations with the Tleilaxu, but this may be a contextual or timeline discrepancy. The most consistent interpretations place the Keep on Gammu (for Duncan’s training) and Arrakis (as Paul’s stronghold).  \n\nIn summary, the Keep is a multi-planetary stronghold with strategic, political, and training purposes, deeply tied to the Bene Gesserit, Duncan Idaho’s conditioning, and Paul Atreides’ legacy. Its exact nature depends on the planet and era, but it consistently functions as a secure, high-stakes location.
