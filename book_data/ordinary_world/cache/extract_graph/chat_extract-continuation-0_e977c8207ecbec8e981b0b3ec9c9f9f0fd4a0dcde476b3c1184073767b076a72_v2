\n　　孙玉厚和老伴叹息着，默默无语地回了他们的住处；他们担心那边早已睡熟的老母亲和小孙子。 \n　　父母亲走后，少安和秀莲都没有脱衣服就倒在了他们的土炕上。这对患难夫妻忍不住紧紧搂抱在一起。他们浑身酸疼，好象走了好长时间的路。唉唉！在灾难面前，他们尤其感到了相互间的恩爱是多么宝贵。 \n　　明天，他们将怎么办？ \n　　少安抱着妻子，难受地絮叨说：“村里人的工钱，赶种麦前无论如何得给他们开一点。要不，咱还有什么脸活在双水村？众人是信任我，才投到了咱门下。如果他们去黄原打一个短工，也把种麦的化肥钱赚回来了……可是，咱拿什么给人家开工钱呀！” \n　　秀莲沉默了一地，突然严肃地对丈夫说：“事到如今，我也想过了，只能让我回一次娘家，看能不能让姐夫先给咱们借一点钱。有林在村里办醋厂，多了拿不出来，一千来块估计还可以……” \n　　少安听妻子这么说，便“腾”起坐起来。他感激地望着仰面而卧的秀莲，似乎在完全的绝望中获得了一点生机。他说：“有个一千多元，咱先给众人都开上点工资，这样他们就能凑合着把种麦子的化肥买回来……干脆，咱两个一块回你们家！” \n　　“你不能走。咱歪好还有个烂摊场，需要照料。再说，马上要收秋，爸爸一个人也忙不过来。”懂事的秀莲劝丈夫。 \n　　少安想不到在这种时候，秀莲的头脑倒比他冷静。“那你什么时候动身？”他问妻子。 \n　　“还等什么时候哩！我天一明就准备挡车走。” \n　　少安温柔地俯下身子，再一次紧紧抱住亲爱的人，在她那零乱得象沙蓬一样的头发上亲了又亲。 \n　　两口子一时无法入睡。他们索性爬起来，为秀莲收拾起了去山西的行囊。 \n　　为了不使虎子缠磨着撵秀莲，他们先不准备给父母那边打招呼；等秀莲走了，少安再没法编个谎话哄儿子。秀莲也不会在山西久留，无论能否向姐夫借到钱，她都会很快返回来的——她惦记着这个烂包了的家庭。 \n　　一打早，夫妻俩就出了门。 \n　　外面三分曙色，七分黑夜。 \n　　公路上已经有汽车开过。 \n　　太阳冒花时分，他们终于挡住了一辆去柳林的汽车。当少安看着妻子一个人坐车走了的时候，难受得抱住头在公路边上蹲了好长时间……几天之后，一些给他干过活的村民，结伴来到\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
