His tragic past includes a scar from Beast Rabban on Giedi Prime, fueling his deep-seated vendetta against the Harkonnens.  \n\nHalleck served as Duke Leto Atreides' trusted lieutenant, participating in military strategy, security operations, and diplomatic missions. He was rescued by Duke Leto from a Harkonnen slave pit, reinforcing his fierce loyalty. A skilled baliset player, his music and poetry became part of Atreides cultural heritage, with his songs preserved in the Museum of Dar-es-Balat.  \n\nAfter the fall of House Atreides, Halleck survived by hiding among smugglers, later rejoining Paul during his rise as Muad'Dib.
