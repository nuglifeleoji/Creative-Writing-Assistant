Both kingdoms were deeply involved in the larger struggle for power and territory that characterized this era.\n\n东吴, known for its strategic military prowess and naval strength, provided crucial military assistance to the Shu kingdom during its crises. This support was vital for Shu, which faced numerous challenges and threats from rival factions. The alliance between these two kingdoms was marked by mutual interests, as they both sought to counter the dominance of the northern kingdom, 曹魏 (Cao Wei), and to secure their own territories and influence.\n\nThe relationship between 蜀 and 东吴 was not merely one of convenience; it was a strategic partnership that emerged from the necessity of survival in a fragmented and hostile political landscape. Their collaboration included joint military campaigns and coordinated efforts to defend against common enemies, showcasing the importance of alliances in the power dynamics of the time.\n\nIn summary, 蜀 and 东吴 were integral players in the larger conflict of the Three Kingdoms period, with 东吴 providing essential military support to 蜀 during critical moments.
