Did this inept fool really expect the God Emperor to speak openly of the recent Face Dancer attack?\n“It has come to my attention,” Leto said, “that you and your people have been spreading lies about what you call my ‘disgusting sexual habits.’”\nNunepi gaped. The accusation was a bold lie, completely unexpected. But Nunepi realized that if he denied it, no one would believe him. The God Emperor had said it. This was an attack of unknown dimensions. Nunepi started to speak while looking at Idaho.\n“Lord, if we...”\n“Look at me!” Leto commanded.\nNunepi jerked his gaze up to Leto’s face.\n“I will inform you only this once,” Leto said. “I have no sexual habits whatsoever. None.”\nPerspiration rolled off Nunepi’s face. He stared at Leto with the fixed intensity of a trapped animal. When Nunepi found his voice, it no longer was the low, controlled instrument of a diplomat, but a trembling and fearful thing.\n“Lord, |... there must be a mistake of...”\n“Be still, you Tleilaxu sneak!” Leto roared. Then: “I am a metamorphic vector of the holy sandworm— Shai-Hulud! | am your God!”\n“Forgive us, Lord,” Nunepi whispered.\n“Forgive you?” Leto’s voice was full of sweet reason. “Of course | forgive you. That is your God’s function. Your crime is forgiven. However, your stupidity requires a response.”\n“Lord, if | could but...”\n“Be still! The spice allotment passes over the Tleilaxu for this decade. You get nothing. As for you personally, my Fish Speakers will now take you into the plaza.”\nTwo burly guardswomen moved in and held Nunepi’s arms. They looked up to Leto for instructions.\n“In the plaza,” Leto said, “his clothing is to be stripped from him. He is to be publicly flogged—fifty lashes.”\nNunepi struggled against the grip of his guards, consternation on his face mingled with rage.\n“Lord, | remind you that | am the Ambassador of...”\n“You are a common criminal and will be treated as such.” Leto nodded to the guards, who began dragging Nunepi away.\n“I wish they’d killed you!” Nunepi raged. “I wish...”\n“Who?” Leto called. “You wish who had killed me? Don’t you know I cannot be killed?”\nThe guards dragged Nunepi out of the chamber as he still raged: “I am innocent! | am innocent!” The protest faded away.\nIdaho leaned close to Leto.\n“Yes, Duncan?” Leto asked.\n“M’Lord, all the envoys will feel fear at this.”\n“Yes. | teach a lesson in responsibility.”\n“M’Lord?”\n“Membership in a conspiracy, as in an army, frees people from the sense of personal responsibility.”\n“But this will cause trouble, m’Lord. I’d best post extra guards.”\n“Not one additional guard!”\n“But you invite...”\n“I invite a bit of military nonsense.”\n“That’s what !l.. .”\n“Duncan, | am a teacher. Remember that. By repetition, | impress the lesson.”\n“What lesson?”\n“The ultimately suicidal nature of military foolishness.”\n“M’Lord, | don’t...”\n“Duncan, consider the inept Nunepi. He is the essence of this lesson.”\n“Forgive my denseness, m’Lord, but | do not understand this thing about military...”\n“They believe that by risking death they pay the price of any violent behavior against enemies of their own choosing. They have the invader mentality. Nunepi does not believe himself responsible for anything done against a/iens.”\nIdaho looked at the portal where the guards had taken Nunepi. “He tried and he lost, m’Lord.”\n“But he cut himself loose from the restraints of the past and he objects to paying the price.”\n“To his people, he’s a patriot.”\n“And how does he see himself, Duncan? As an instrument of history.”\nIdaho lowered his voice and leaned closer to Leto.\n“How are you different, m’Lord?”\nLeto chuckled. “Ahhh, Duncan, how | love your perceptiveness. You have observed that | am the ultimate alien. Do you not wonder if | also can be a loser?”\n“The thought has crossed my mind.”\n“Even losers can shroud themselves in the proud mantle of ‘the past,’ old friend.”\n“Are you and Nunepi alike in that?”\n“Militant missionary religions can share this illusion of the ‘proud past,’ but few understand the ultimate peril to humankind—that false sense of freedom from responsibility for your own actions.”\n“These are strange words, m’Lord. How do | take their meaning?”\n“Their meaning is whatever speaks to you. Are you incapable of listening?”\n“| have ears, m’Lord!”\n“Do you now? | cannot see them.”\n“Here, m’lord. Here and here!” Idaho pointed at his own ears as he spoke.\n“But they do not hear. Therefore you have no ears, neither here nor hear.”\n“You make a joke of me, m’Lord?”\n“To hear is to hear. That which exists cannot be made into itself for it already exists. To be is to be.”\n“Your strange words...”\n“Are but words. | spoke them. They are gone. No one heard them, therefore they no longer exist. If they no longer\nexist, perhaps they can be made to exist again and then perhaps someone will hear them.”\n“Why do you poke fun at me, m’Lord?”\n“| poke nothing at you except words. | do it without fear of offending because | have learned that you have no ears.”\n“| don’t understand you, m’Lord.”\n“That is the beginning of knowledge—the discovery of something we do not understand.”\nBefore Idaho could respond, Leto gave a hand signal to a nearby guard who waved a hand in front of a crystalline control panel on the wall behind the God Emperor’s dais. A three-dimensional view of Nunepi’s punishment appeared in the center of the chamber.\nIdaho stepped down to the floor of the chamber and peered closely at the scene. It was shown from a slight elevation looking down on the plaza, and was complete with sounds of the swelling throng who had run to the scene at the first signs of excitement.\nNunepi was bound to two legs of a tripod, his feet spread wide, his arms tied together above him almost at the apex of the tripod. His clothing had been ripped from his body and lay around him in rags. A bulky, masked Fish Speaker stood nearby holding an improvised whip fashioned of elacca rope which had been frayed at the end into wirelike fine strands. Idaho thought he recognized the masked woman as the Friend of his first interview.\nAt a signal from a Guard officer, the masked Fish Speaker stepped forward and brought the elacca whip down ina Slashing arc onto Nunepi’s exposed back.\nIdaho winced. The crowd gasped.\nWelts appeared where the whip had struck, but Nunepi remained silent.\nAgain, the whip descended. Blood betrayed the lines of this second stroke.\nOnce more, the whip flayed Nunepi’s back. More blood appeared.\nLeto felt remote sadness. Nayla is too ardent, he thought. She will kill him and that will cause problems.\n“Duncan!” Leto called.\nIdaho turned from his fascinated examination of the projected scene just as a shout lifted from the crowd— response to a particularly bloody stroke.\n“Send someone to stop the flogging after twenty lashes,” Leto said. “Have it announced that the magnanimity of the God Emperor has reduced the punishment.”\nIdaho raised a hand to one of the guards, who nodded and ran from the chamber.\n“Come here, Duncan,” Leto said.\nStill smarting under what he believed was Leto’s poking fun at him, Idaho returned to Leto’s side.\n“Whatever | do,” Leto said, “it is to teach a lesson.”\nIdaho rigidly willed himself not to look back at the scene of Nunepi’s punishment. Was that the sound of Nunepi groaning? The shouts of the crowd pierced Idaho. He stared up into Leto’s eyes.\n“There is a question in your mind,” Leto said.\n“Many questions, m’Lord.”\n“Speak them.”\n“What is the lesson in that fool’s punishment? What do we say when asked?”\n“We say that no one is permitted to blaspheme against the God Emperor.”\n“A bloody lesson, m’'Lord.”\n“Not as bloody as some I’ve taught.”\nIdaho shook his head from side to side in obvious dismay. “Nothing good’s going to come of this!”\n“Precisely!”\nSafaris through ancestral memories teach me many things. The patterns, ahhh, the patterns. Liberal bigots are the ones who trouble me most. | distrust the extremes. Scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefers the past over any future. Scratch a liberal and find a closet aristocrat. It’s true! Liberal governments always develop into aristocracies. The bureaucracies betray the true intent of people who form such governments. Right from the first, the //ttle people who formed the governments which promised to equalize the social burdens found themselves suddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies. Of course, all bureaucracies follow this pattern, but what a hypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner. Ahhh, well, if patterns teach me anything it’s that patterns are repeated. My oppressions, by and large, are no worse than any of the others and, at least, | teach a new lesson.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nt was well into the darkness of Audience Day before Leto could meet with the Bene Gesserit delegation. Moneo had prepared the Reverend Mothers for the delay, repeating the God Emperor’s reassurances. Reporting back to his Emperor, Moneo had said: “They expect a rich reward.” “We shall see,” Leto had said. “We shall see. Now, tell me what it was the Duncan demanded of you as you entered.” “He wished to know if you had ever before had someone flogged.” “And you replied?” “That there was no record of, nor had | ever before witnessed, such a punishment.” “His response?” “This is not Atreides.” “Does he think I’m insane?” “He did not say that.”\n“There was more to your encounter. What else troubles our new Duncan?”\n“He has met the Ixian Ambassador, Lord. He finds Hwi Noree attractive. He inquired of...”\n“That must be prevented, Moneo!\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor, a metamorphic vector of the holy sandworm Shai-Hulud, who rules with absolute authority and teaches lessons through harsh punishments and cryptic words>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NUNEPI<|>PERSON<|>Nunepi is the Tleilaxu Ambassador who is publicly flogged by Leto for spreading lies and demonstrating the God Emperor's displeasure with the Tleilaxu>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola and loyal servant of Leto, often questioning the God Emperor's methods but remaining obedient>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto's elite guardswomen who enforce his will, including carrying out punishments like Nunepi's flogging>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and manipulative faction known for their ghola technology and axlotl tanks, currently in disfavor with Leto>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit are a powerful sisterhood with political and genetic ambitions, awaiting an audience with Leto>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>EVENT<|>Shai-Hulud is the Fremen term for the sandworms of Arrakis, central to Leto's divine mythology and physical transformation>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FLOGGING OF NUNEPI<|>EVENT<|>A public punishment ordered by Leto to demonstrate the consequences of defying the God Emperor, reduced from fifty to twenty lashes>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>NUNEPI<|>Leto orders Nunepi's flogging for blasphemy and to teach a lesson about responsibility<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Leto engages Duncan in philosophical dialogue, testing his loyalty and perception<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TLEILAXU<|>Leto punishes the Tleilaxu by withholding spice allotments and humiliating their ambassador<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>NUNEPI<|>Duncan witnesses Nunepi's punishment and questions Leto's motives<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>NUNEPI<|>The Fish Speakers carry out Nunepi's flogging under Leto's command<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>LETO<|>The Bene Gesserit seek an audience with Leto, anticipating a reward<|>4>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>Leto identifies as a metamorphic vector of Shai-Hulud, embodying its divine power<|>9>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
