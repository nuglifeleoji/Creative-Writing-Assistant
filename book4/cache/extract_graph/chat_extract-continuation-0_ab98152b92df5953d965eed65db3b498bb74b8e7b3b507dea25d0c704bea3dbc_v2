\n　　田润叶这样忙碌地收拾着，精心地划算着，倒象是为自己布置新婚的洞房！ \n                  第50章\n　　日子过得快如飞箭！算一算，田福军从省里回到黄原任职已经有两年的时光；他在这个贫困的家乡所在地区任一把手也已经有一年多了。 \n　　两年之间，不仅黄原地区，整个中国发生了多么大的变化呀！许多不久前人们连想也不敢想的事，现在却成了我们生活中最一般的现象。中国的变化震动了资本主义国家，震动了社会主义国家，也震动了中国自己。 \n　　阐述这个变化的深远历史意义也许不是小说所能胜任的。我们只是在描绘这个历史大背景下人们的生活时，不由地感叹：我们这一代人经历了如此深刻而又富于戏剧性的历程！现在还是孩子的人们，将不会全部理解我们这代人对生活的那种复杂的体验。 \n　　是的，我们经历了一个大时代。我们穿越过各种历史的暴风骤雨。上至领袖人物，下至普通老百姓，身上和心上都不同程度地留下了伤痕。甚至在我们生命结束之前，也许还不会看到这个社会的完全成熟，而大概只能看出一个大的趋势来。但我们仍然有理由为自己生活过的土地和岁月而感到自豪！我们这代人所做的可能仅仅是，用我们的经验、教训、泪水、汗水和鲜血掺合的混凝土，为中国光辉的未来打下一个基础。毫无疑问，在这一历史进程中，社会和我们自身的局限以及种种缺陷弊端是不可避免的。但这决不能成为倒退的口实。应该明白，这些局限和缺陷是社会进步到更高阶段上产生的。 \n　　可是，在具体的现实生活中，坚持前行的人们，步履总是十分艰难的。中国式的改革就会遇到中国式的阻力。 \n　　近一年多来，有关田福军的告状信不断头地从黄原飞向省城和北京。中国的其它事干起来不容易。但告状倒相当简便——八分人民币买一张邮票就可以了。这些信件寄到了中央纪委、省纪委、中组部、省组织部和中央以及省的人民来信来访办公室。更多的信直接寄给了省委正副书记个人手里。告状信的内容五花八门，从政治错误，经济犯罪一直到男女关系。如果这些问题都能落实，田福军恐怕够判死刑了。 \n　　福军知道有人告他。他也知道省纪委和省委组织部来调查过他的“问题”。但他不知道告他告得如此猛烈；也不知道这场“倒田运动”的幕后人物是他的副手高凤阁。 \n　　地委副书记高凤阁是黄原前地委书记苗凯多年精心培养的接班人——接他自己班的人。但由于田福军从省上“杀”回来，高凤阁没有当成专员，当然就更当不成地委书记了。苗凯调离后，高凤阁窝着一肚子不舒服，便开始\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
