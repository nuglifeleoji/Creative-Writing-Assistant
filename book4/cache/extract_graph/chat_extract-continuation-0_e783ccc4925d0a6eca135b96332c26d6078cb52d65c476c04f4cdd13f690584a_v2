\n　　“不过，我们的驻地旁边有一个军马场，这使环境稍微有一些生机。日出的时候，出牧的马群象一团团彩云向茫茫的草原上奔去，日落的时候，又从地平线那边涌涌地漫过来。马的嘶鸣声打破了草原上梦境一般的寂寥。这时候，人的心就不由地激动起来。尤其是我们这些刚来的新兵，在每天日出日落的时候，总要跑出去站在土坯房的屋脊上，观看这壮丽的一幕，到了后来，大部分人慢慢也就厌倦了，在军马场，马群出牧和归牧的时光里，没有人再有兴趣跑出来观看。“可是我永远对一天中这短暂而美妙的景象着迷。尽管早晨马群出牧的时候我也不再出房间了，可我总不放过观看晚间马群归牧时的那个场面。唉，你没有身临其境，你就无法想象那景象是如何激动人心。那时候，太阳正在西边的地平线上下沉。草原上的落日又红又大，把山、湖、原野都染成了一片绛红。就在这一片绛红色中，归牧的马群在地平线上出现了。起先，那只是一条细细的黑线，在圆圆的红日里蠕动。这条黑线慢慢地变得粗大起来。不久，你的眼前就滚动起一片奔涌的彩潮。马群越来越近，绛红色的草原上象卷起了一团狂风。你感到脚下的土地都被马蹄敲得颤动起来。隆隆的马蹄声伴随着马的警号般的嘶鸣；马鬃象燃烧的火焰似地飞扬。牧马人套杆上的绳圈在空中划出一轮轮弧线。咸水湖上惊起了一片又一片的飞鸟。与此同时，军写场的马驹欢叫着冲出棚栏，去迎接它们的父母亲归来……“每天傍晚，我总要立在营房的屋脊后面，观看这一幕——这几乎成了我的一个‘保留节日’。 \n　　“不知是哪一天，从那远方归牧的马群中，突然传来一个女孩子的歌唱声。那是用藏语在歌唱。虽然听不懂歌词，但我知道唱的是那首有名的青海民歌《在那遥远的地方》。那歌声一下子就迷住了我。说实话，我从来没听过一个人能把歌唱得这么嘹亮和美妙，嗓音如同金属一般辉煌。当然，这副嗓子显然不是调教出来的，完全是一种野腔野调。仅凭她声音的本色，就会使人听得神魂颠倒……“从此以后，这歌声就再也没有中断。我每天傍晚也不仅仅是去观看马群的归牧了，主要是想去听那迷人的歌声。我的心激动地沉浸在这动人的歌声中，久久地不能平静下\n######################\nOutput:",
