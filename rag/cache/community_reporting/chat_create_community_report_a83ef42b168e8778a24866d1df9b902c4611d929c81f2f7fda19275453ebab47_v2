It serves as a central hub for their operations, housing a heavily defended and labyrinthine complex, including the Great Hall where prisoners like Rebecca and Lucilla are held. The planet has become a focal point of conflict between the Honored Matres and the Bene Gesserit, with the latter targeting it for military operations, including a planned strike centered around the Citadel.  \n\nJunction functions as both a transit hub and a control center for Dama, though its facilities appear neglected under Honored Matre rule. It is a site of chaotic events, including troop movements and battles, visible from Odrade’s vantage point in a tower. The planet is also a key meeting place, where Odrade and the Bene Gesserit intend to negotiate with Honored Matre leadership—though the situation may be a trap.  \n\nMilitary engagements are frequent, with Teg’s forces redirecting their focus to Junction after a feint on Gammu. The Bene Gesserit deploy devices to track enemy movements, highlighting Junction’s role as a battleground. Additionally, Scytale once sought sanctuary here before being intercepted by the Bene Gesserit, further underscoring its contested nature.  \n\nIn summary, Junction is a volatile and strategically vital planet, serving as the Honored Matres' base of power while remaining the primary target of Bene Gesserit offensives, negotiations, and intelligence operations. Its history as a Guild stronghold adds to its significance in the ongoing conflict.\",8\r\n1290,BATTLE OF JUNCTION,\"The Battle of Junction is a major conflict between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, led by Miles Teg.
