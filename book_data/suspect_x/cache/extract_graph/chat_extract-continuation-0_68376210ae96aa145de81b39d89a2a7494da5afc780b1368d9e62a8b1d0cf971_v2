It had become a jumble. Nothing fitted anywhere. Random pieces that probably did not go together at all.\nBut they did!\nMother Superior’s voice continued in his memory. So there is more.\n“People who know this go to the heart of it,” Odrade said. “They warn that you cannot think about what you’re doing. That’s a sure way to fail. You just do it!”\nDon’t think. Do it. He sensed anarchy. Her words threw him back onto resources other than Mentat training.\nBene Gesserit trickery! She did this deliberately, knowing the effect. Where was the affection he sometimes felt radiating from her? Could she have concern for the well- being of someone she treated this way?\nWhen Odrade left them (he barely noticed her departure), Murbella sat on the bed and straightened the robe around her knees.\nHumans can balance on strange surfaces. Movement in his mind: the pieces of the mosaic trying to find relationships.\nHe felt a new surge in the universe. Those two strange people in his vision? They were part of it. He knew this without being able to say why. What was it the Bene Gesserit claimed? “We modify old fashions and old beliefs.”\n“Look at me!” Murbella said.\nVoice? Not quite but now he was sure she tried it on and she had not told him they were training her in this witchery.\nHe saw the alien look in her green eyes that told him she was thinking about her former associates.\n“Never try to be more clever than the Bene Gesserit, Duncan.”\nSpeaking for the comeyes?\nHe could not be sure. It was the intelligence behind her eyes that gripped him these days. He could feel it growing there, as though her teachers blew into a balloon and Murbella’s intellect expanded the way her abdomen expanded with new life.\nVoice! What were they doing to her?\nThat was a stupid question. He knew what they were doing. They were taking her away from him, making a Sister of her. No longer my lover, my marvelous Murbella. A Reverend Mother then, remotely calculating in everything she did. A witch. Who could love a witch?\n| could. And always will.\n“They grab you from your blind side to use you for their own purposes,” he said.\nHe could see his words take hold. She had awakened to this trap after the fact. The Bene Gesserit were so damnably clever! They had enticed her into their trap, giving her small glimpses of things as magnetic as the force binding her to him. It could only be an enraging realization to an Honored Matre.\nWe trap others! They do not trap us!\nBut this had been done by the Bene Gesserit. They were in a different category. Almost Sisters. Why deny it? And she wanted their abilities. She wanted out of this probation into the full teaching she could sense just beyond the ship’s walls. Didn’t she know why they still kept her on probation?\nThey know she still struggles in their trap.\nMurbella slipped out of her robe and climbed into the bed beside him. Not touching. But keeping that armed sense of nearness between their bodies.\n“They originally intended me to control Sheeana for them,” he said.\n“As you control me?”\n“Do | control you?”\n“Sometimes | think you’re a comic, Duncan.”\n“If | can’t laugh at myself I’m really lost.”\n“Laugh at your pretensions to humor, too?”\n“Those first.” He turned toward her and cupped her left breast in his hand, feeling the nipple harden under his palm. “Did you know I was never weaned?”\n“Never in all of those...”\n“Not once.”\n“I might have guessed.” A smile formed fleetingly on her lips, and abruptly both of them were laughing, clutching each other, helpless with it. Presently, Murbella said, “Damn, damn, damn.”\n“Damn who?” as his laughter subsided and they pulled apart, forcing the separation.\n“Not who, what. Damn fate!”\n“| don’t think fate cares.”\n“| love you and I’m not supposed to do that if I’m to be a proper Reverend Mother.”\nHe hated these excursions so close to self-pity. Joke then! “You've never been a proper anything.” He massaged the pregnant swelling of her abdomen.\n“Lam proper!”\n“That’s a word they left out when they made you.”\nShe pushed his hand away and sat up to look down at him. “Reverend Mothers are never supposed to love.”\n“I know that.” Did my anguish reveal itself?\nShe was too caught up in her own worries. “When | get to the Spice Agony...”\n“Love! | don’t like the idea of agony associated with you in any way.”\n“How can | avoid it? I’m already in the chute. Very soon they'll have me up to speed. l'Il go very fast then.”\nHe wanted to turn away but her eyes held him.\n“Truly, Duncan. | can feel it. In a way, it’s like pregnancy. There comes a point when it’s too dangerous to abort. You must go through with it.”\n“So we love each other!” Forcing his thoughts away from one danger into another.\n“And they forbid it.”\nHe looked up at the comeyes. “The watchdogs are watching us and they have fangs.”\n“I know. l'm talking to them right now. My love for you is not a flaw. Their coldness is the flaw. They’re just like Honored Matres!”\nA game where one of the pieces can’t be moved.\nHe wanted to shout it but listeners behind the comeyes would hear more than spoken words. Murbella was right. It was dangerous to think you could gull Reverend Mothers.\nSomething veiled in her eyes as she looked down at him. “How very strange you looked just then.” He recognized the Reverend Mother she might become.\nVeer away from that thought!\nThinking about the strangeness of his memories sometimes diverted her. She thought his previous incarnations made him somehow similar to a Reverend Mother.\n“I’ve died so many times.”\n“You remember it?” The same question every time.\nHe shook his head, not daring to say anything more for the watchdogs to interpret.\nNot the deaths and reawakenings.\nThose became dulled by repetition. Sometimes he didn’t even bother to put them into his secret data-dump. No... it was the unique encounters with other humans, the long collection of recognitions.\nThat was a thing Sheeana claimed she wanted from him. “Intimate trivia. It’s the stuff all artists want.”\nSheeana did not know what she asked. All of those living encounters had created new meanings. Patterns within patterns. Minuscule things gained a poignancy he despaired of sharing with anyone... even with Murbella.\nThe touch of a hand on my arm. A Cchild’s laughing face. The glitter in an attacker’s eyes.\nMundane things without counting. A familiar voice saying: “Į just want to put my feet up and collapse tonight. Don’t ask me to move.”\nAll had become part of him. They were bound into his character. Living had cemented them inextricably and he could not explain it to anyone.\nMurbella spoke without looking at him. “There were many women in those lives of yours.”\n“I’ve never counted them.”\n“Did you love them?”\n“They’re dead, Murbella. All | can promise is that there are no jealous ghosts in my past.”\nMurbella extinguished the glowglobes. He closed his eyes and felt darkness close in as she crept into his arms. He held her tightly, knowing she needed it, but his mind rolled of its own volition.\nAn old memory produced a Mentat teacher’s saying: “The greatest relevancy can become irrelevant in the space of a heartbeat. Mentats should look upon such moments with joy.”\nHe felt no joy.\nAll of those serial lives continued within him in defiance of Mentat relevancies. A Mentat came at his universe fresh in each instant. Nothing old, nothing new, nothing set in ancient adhesives, nothing truly known. You were the net and you existed only to examine the catch.\nWhat did not go through? How fine a mesh did I use on this lot?\nThat was the Mentat view. But there was no way the Tleilaxu could have included all of those ghola-Idaho cells to\nrecreate him. There had to be gaps in their serial collection of his cells. He had identified many of those gaps.\nBut no gaps in my memory. | remember them all.\nHe was a network linked outside of Time. That is how I can see the people of that vision... the net. It was the only explanation Mentat awareness could provide and if the Sisterhood guessed, they would be terrified. No matter how many times he denied it, they would say: “Another Kwisatz Haderach! Kill him!”\nSo work for yourself, Mentat!\nHe knew he had most of the mosaic pieces but still they did not go together in that Ahh, hah! assembly of questions Mentats prized.\nA game where one of the pieces can’t be moved.\nExcuses for extraordinary behavior.\n“They want our willing participation in their dream.”\nTest the limits!\nHumans can balance on strange surfaces.\nGet in tune. Don’t think. Do it.\nThe best art imitates life in a compelling way. If it imitates a dream, it must be a dream of life. Otherwise, there is no place where we can connect. Our plugs don’t fit.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nA’ they traveled south toward the desert in the early afternoon, Odrade found the countryside disturbingly changed from her previous inspection three months earlier. She felt vindicated in having chosen ground vehicles. Views framed by the thick plaz protecting them from the dust revealed more details at this level.\nMuch drier.\nHer immediate party rode in a relatively light car—only fifteen passengers including the driver. Suspensors and sophisticated jet drive when they were not on ground-effect. Capable of a smooth three hundred klicks an hour on the glaze. Her escort (too large, thanks to an overzealous Tamalane) followed in a bus that also carried changes of clothing, foods and drinks for wayside stops.\nStreggi, seated beside Odrade and behind the driver, said: “Could we not manage a small rain here, Mother Superior?”\nOdrade’s lips thinned. Silence was the best answer.\nThey had been late starting. All of them assembled on the loading dock and were ready to leave when a message came down from Bellonda. Another disaster report requiring Mother Superior’s personal attention at the last minute!\nIt was one of those times when Odrade felt her only possible role was that of official interpreter. Walk to the edge of the stage and tell them what it meant: “Today,\nSisters, we learned that Honored Matres have obliterated four more of our planets. We are that much smaller.”\nOnly twelve planets (including Buzzell) and the faceless hunter with the axe is that much closer.\nOdrade felt the chasm yawning beneath her.\nBellonda had been ordered to contain this latest bad news until a more appropriate moment.\nOdrade looked out the window beside her. What was an appropriate moment for such news?\nThey had been driving south a little more than three hours, the burner-glazed roadway like a green river ahead of them. This passage led them through hillsides of cork oaks that stretched out to ridge-enclosed horizons. The oaks had been allowed to grow gnomelike\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, known for their political and genetic manipulations>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother and the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, known for her strategic mind and leadership>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a former Honored Matre undergoing training to become a Reverend Mother, and she is pregnant with Duncan Idaho's child>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola with memories of past lives, a skilled fighter, and a key figure in Bene Gesserit plans>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a young woman with a mysterious connection to sandworms, sought after by the Bene Gesserit for her unique abilities>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mentats are human computers trained in logical analysis and strategic thinking, often serving as advisors>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and dominant faction opposed to the Bene Gesserit, known for their aggression and sexual dominance>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The Spice Agony is a transformative and often deadly ritual undergone to become a Reverend Mother>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a secretive and genetically manipulative faction known for creating gholas and other biological constructs>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the sisterhood<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Murbella is being trained by the Bene Gesserit to become a Reverend Mother<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan Idaho is a key asset and sometimes a pawn in Bene Gesserit schemes<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Murbella and Duncan Idaho are lovers, and she is pregnant with his child<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Sheeana is of great interest to the Bene Gesserit due to her unique abilities<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres and the Bene Gesserit are enemies, with the former seeking to destroy the latter<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>SPICE AGONY<|>Murbella is preparing to undergo the Spice Agony to become a Reverend Mother<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLEILAXU<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola created by the Tleilaxu, with memories of past lives<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
