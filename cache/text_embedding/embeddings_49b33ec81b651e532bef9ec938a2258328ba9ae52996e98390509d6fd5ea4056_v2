But—”\n“I should not have asked,” he said.\n“No.” She shrugged. “There’s good political reason —as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And....” She sighed. “...motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It\ndegrades everything it touches. If | made him do... this, then it would not be his doing.”\n“It’s a thing my Wanna might have said,” he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. “Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men. One of them | love very much. He’s charming, witty, considerate... tender—everything a woman could desire. But the other man is...cold, callous, demanding, selfish—as harsh and cruel as a winter wind. That’s the man Shaped by the father.” Her face contorted. “If only that old man had died when my Duke was born!”\nIn the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds. Presently, she took a deep breath, said, “Leto’s\nright—these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.” She turned, sweeping the room with her gaze. “If you’ll excuse me, Wellington, | want another look through this wing before | assign quarters.”\nHe nodded. “Of course.” And he thought: /f only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.\nJessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out. A// the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no doubt. He’s a good man. Again, She hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh\nand drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn he’s so easily read. | should place more trust in my friends.\nMany have remarked the speed with which Muad’Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.\n—FROM “THE HUMANITY OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh’s sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his mother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn’t approve. Things were too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.\nIf I slip out without asking I haven’t disobeyed orders. And I will stay in the house where it’s safe.\nHe heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were indistinct—something about the spice...the Harkonnens. The conversation rose and fell.\nPaul’s attention went to the carved headboard of his bed—a false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room’s functions. A\nleaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He knew if he pushed the fish’s one visible eye that would turn on the room’s Suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another changed the temperature.\nQuietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side. The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.\nIt was as though the room had been designed to entice him.\nThe room and this planet.\nHe thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him —\"“Arrakis: His Imperial Majesty’s Desert Botanical Testing Station.” It was an old filmbook from before discovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul’s mind, each with its picture imprinted by the book’s mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush...kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse....\nNames and pictures, names and pictures from man’s terranic past—and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.\nSo many new things to learn about—the spice.\nAnd the sandworms.\nA door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother’s footsteps retreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and remain in the other room.\nNow was the moment to go exploring.\nPaul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet. He Stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.\nFrom behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter- seeker no more than five centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once—a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some nearby hand and eye. It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.\nThe seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.\nThrough Paul’s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the room to reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion—anything that moved. A shield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance—and there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.\nNow, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat.\nThe hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.\nI must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom. | must grip tightly.\nThe thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.\nWho is operating that thing? Paul wondered. /t has to be someone near. | could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.\nThe hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.\nThe hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.\nPaul’s right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing’s nose against the metal doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand.\nStill, he held it—to be certain.\nPaul’s eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes.\n“Your father has sent for you,” she said. “There are men in the hall to escort you.”\nPaul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sacklike dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand.\n“I’ve heard of suchlike,” she said. “It would’ve killed me, not so?”\nHe had to swallow before he could speak. “I...was its target.”\n“But it was coming for me.”\n“Because you were moving.” And he wondered: Who is this creature?\n“Then you saved my life,” she said.\n“I saved both our lives.”\n“Seems like you could’ve let it have me and made your own escape,” she said.\n“Who are you?” he asked.\n“The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.”\n“How did you know where to find me?”\n“Your mother told me. | met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall.” She pointed to her right. “Your father’s men are still waiting.”\nThose will be Hawat’s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this thing.\n“Go to my father’s men,” he said. “Tell them I’ve caught a hunter-seeker in the house and they’re to Spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately. They’ll know how to go about it. The operator’s sure to be a stranger among us.”\nAnd he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn’t. The seeker had been under control when she entered.\n“Before | do your bidding, manling,” Mapes said, “l must cleanse the way between us. You’ve put a water burden on me that I’m not sure I care to Support. But we Fremen pay our debts—be they black debts or\nwhite debts. And it’s known to us that you’ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we’re certain sure of it. Mayhap there’s the hand guided that flesh-cutter.”\nPaul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.\nHe thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it. She’d told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat’s men in a minute.\nHis mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memory— prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.\nStill gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.\nShe’d said his mother was someplace down here— Stairs...a weirding room.\nWhat had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: “Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it’s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\nOval? she wondered.

She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\nOval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.\nThrough the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the hall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.\nJessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her sliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.\nSurely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one individual’s hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And\nthere were ways to open any palm lock—as she had learned at school.\nJessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the lines—a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the surface.\nShe felt the click.\nBut there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.\n“There are men in the great hall say they’ve been sent by the Duke to get young master Paul,” Mapes said. “They've the ducal signet and the guard has identified them.” She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.\nA cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That’s a good sign.\n“He’s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,” Jessica said. “If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next room. Paul may require a wakeshot.”\nAgain, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.\nHawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can’t be anything too terrible in here.\nShe pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.\nAn airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, Saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat’s personal mark. The door was left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.\nShe stepped over the lip into the little room.\nWhy an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in Special climates.\nSpecial climate!\nThat would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing things had to be irrigated. The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open securely with the stick\nHawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She recognized Galach words, read:\n“O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God’s Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.”\nJessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.\nA yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Fi/ter glass!\nShe stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.\n“A wet-planet conservatory,” she breathed.\nPotted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso...roses....\nEven roses!\nShe bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room.\nRhythmic noise invaded her senses.\nShe parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a- gallop onto the metal bowl.\nJessica sent herself through the quick sense- clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the room’s perimeter. It appeared to be about ten meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original building’s completion.\nShe stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock- set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.\nWater everywhere in this room—on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life. Water being\nwasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness.\nShe glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting Known as the Shield Wall.\nFilter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn’t been time. And he’s been busy with more serious problems.\nShe recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust.\nBut this room embodied a statement far more Significant than the lack of waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis— possibly more.\nJessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat’s daysigns on it, studied a message written on the pad:\n“TO THE LADY JESSICA—\nMay this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.\nMy kindest wishes, MARGOT LADY FENRING”\nJessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor’s former proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count married his Lady.\nEven as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: “On that path lies danger.”\nJessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots. Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.\nSomething in the position of the pad? she wondered.\nBut Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:\n“Your son and the Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection.” Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots: “l do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that | cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.”\nJessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.\n“Paul!” She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. “What is that?”\nHe spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: “Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my\nroom and smashed its nose, but | want to be Sure. Water should short it out.”\n“Immerse it!” she commanded.\nHe obeyed.\nPresently, she said: “Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.”\nHe brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.\nIt was dead.\nShe dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized—the B.G. Way.\n“This place could conceal anything,” he said.\n“I’ve reason to believe it’s safe,” she said.\n“My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said—”\n“It was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.”\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: ^“... defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n“Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,” he said. “That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.”\n“The Shadout Mapes,” Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. “A summons from your father to—”\n“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe", " place could conceal anything,” he said.\n“I’ve reason to believe it’s safe,” she said.\n“My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said—”\n“It was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.”\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: ^“... defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n“Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,” he said. “That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.”\n“The Shadout Mapes,” Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. “A summons from your father to—”\n“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe relaxed slightly.\nBut Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.\nPaul spoke matter-of-factly: “It’s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them.”\nA rapping sounded at the airlock door—the code knock of one of Hawat’s corps.\n“Come in,” Paul called.\nThe door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room. “There you are, sir,” he said. “The housekeeper said you'd be here.” He glanced around the room. “We found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console.”\n“I'll want to take part in the interrogation,” Jessica said.\n“Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.”\n“Nothing to identify him?” she asked.\n“We've found nothing yet, my Lady.”\n“Was he an Arrakeen native?” Paul asked.\nJessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.\n“He has the native look,” the man said. “Put into that cairn more’n a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday. l'Il stake my reputation on it.”\n“No one questions your thoroughness,” Jessica said.\n“I question it, my Lady. We should’ve used sonic probes down there.”\n“|I presume that’s what you’re doing now,” Paul said.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Send word to my father that we'll be delayed.”\n“At once, sir.” He glanced at Jessica. “It’s Hawat’s order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.” Again, his eyes swept the room. “What of this place?”\n“I’ve reason to believe it safe,” she said. “Both Hawat and I have inspected it.”\n“Then l'Il mount guard outside here, m’Lady, until we've been over the house once more.” He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door closed behind him.\nPaul broke the sudden silence, saying: “Had we better go over the house later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss.”\n“This wing was the only place | hadn’t examined,” She said. “I put it off to last because....”\n“Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,” he said.\nShe darted a quick look at his face, questioning.\n“Do you distrust Hawat?” she asked.\n“No, but he’s getting old...he’s overworked. We could take some of the load from him.”\n“That'd only shame him and impair his efficiency,” She said. “A stray insect won’t be able to wander into\nthis wing after he hears about this. He’ll be shamed that....”\n“We must take our own measures,” he said.\n“Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,” she said. “He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him...many times over.”\nPaul said: “When my father is bothered by something you’ve done he says ‘Bene Gesserit!’ like a swear word.”\n“And what is it about me that bothers your father?”\n“When you argue with him.”\n“You are not your father, Paul.”\nAnd Paul thought: /t’// worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.\n“What're you holding back?” Jessica asked. “This isn’t like you, Paul.”\nHe shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.\nAnd Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.\n“My father must learn of this at once,” he said. “I'll radiograph it in code and get it off.”\n“No,” she said. “You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it.”\n“Do you mean we should trust no one?”\n“There’s another possibility,” she said. “This message may have been meant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it’s true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.”\nPaul’s face remained sturdily somber. “To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way,” he said.\n“You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it,” she said.\n“I understand.”\nShe turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking—a yellowed ball above the cliffs.\nPaul turned with her, said: “I don’t think it’s Hawat, either. Is it possible it’s Yueh?”\n“He’s not a lieutenant or companion,” she said. “And | can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.”\nPaul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn’t be Gurney...or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible. They're all from families that’ve been loyal to us for generations —for good reason.\nJessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here! She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard— lines of spice silos in it with stilt-legged watchtowers Standing around it like so many startled spiders. She could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall—silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.\nSlowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear,\nprecise rhythm—a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink- blink-blink...\nPaul stirred beside her in the dusky room.\nBut Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.\nSomeone signaling!\nShe tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.\nOther lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff—very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!\nAnd it was gone.\nThe false star in the cliff winked out immediately.\nSignals...and they filled her with premonition.\nWhy were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why couldn’t they use the communications network?\nThe answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemies—between Harkonnen agents.\nThere came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat’s man: “All clear, sir...m’Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his father.”\nIt is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet\nof the landing control tower outside Arrakeen. The night’s first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze—yellow...white...blue.\nHe thought of the notices posted now above his Signature all through the populous places of the planet: “Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.”\nThe ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis... and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe rage was difficult to suppress.\nHe saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawat’s lieutenant.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nHe shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries.\nBetter a cautious delay than...\nThe lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.\n“Our Sublime Padishah Emperor....”\nIf the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor’s private note to his “Noble Duke”—the disdainful allusions to veiled men and women: “...but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?”\nThe Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles Caladan...but l'Il never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. | may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—\n“My lungs taste the air of Time Blown past falling sands....”\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert—barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_49b33ec81b651e532bef9ec938a2258328ba9ae52996e98390509d6fd5ea4056_v2"}
