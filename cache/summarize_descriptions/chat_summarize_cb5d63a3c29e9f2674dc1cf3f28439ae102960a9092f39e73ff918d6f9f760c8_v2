She learns much of this history directly from Leto himself, including elements not preserved in other records, reinforcing her reliance on it as a source of knowledge. The Oral History informs her perspective on key events, such as the history of Goygoa and the brides of Leto, which she references to contextualize past and present circumstances.  \n\nBeyond mere historical documentation, Siona uses the Oral History to justify her beliefs and actions, treating it as both a moral and ideological guide. She also draws upon it when questioning Leto about his controversial breeding program, demonstrating its role in shaping her skepticism and resistance. The Oral History thus serves as a foundational influence on Sionaâ€™s identity, beliefs, and interactions with Leto, blending cultural tradition with personal conviction.  \n\nThis summary resolves any potential contradictions by presenting the Oral History as a singular, authoritative source for Siona, whether acquired through Leto or invoked in her own reasoning. It underscores her dependence on this tradition while maintaining a coherent narrative about its significance in her life.
