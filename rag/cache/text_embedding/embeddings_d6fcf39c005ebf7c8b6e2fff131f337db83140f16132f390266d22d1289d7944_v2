thought.\nShe compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: “Well-I-l, now—how does it feel to be a killer?”\nPaul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother’s cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.\nStilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: “When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.”\nJessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made—it served a purpose now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw. Admiration, yes, and fear...and in some—loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.\nPaul looked at his mother. “You know what it was,” he said.\nShe heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her glance across the troop, said: “Paul has never before killed a man with a naked blade.”\nStilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.\n“I wasn’t playing with him,” Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother, straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis’ blood on the cavern floor. “I did not want to kill him.”\nJessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering awareness spread through the troop.\n“That’s why y’ asked him to yield,” Stilgar said. “| see. Our ways are different, but you'll see the sense in them. | thought we’d admitted a scorpion into our midst.” He hesitated, then: “And | shall not call you lad the more.”\nA voice from the troop called out: “Needs a naming, Stil.”\nStilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. “I see strength in you...like the strength beneath a pillar.”\nAgain he paused, then: “You shall be known among us as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume...Usul.”\nMurmuring went through the troop: “Good choice, that...strong...bring us luck.” And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.\n“Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.\n“How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?” Paul asked, remembering the pop-hop of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one hand.\nA chuckle sounded through the troop.\n“We call that one muad’dib,” Stilgar said.\nJessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen would accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear of her son and for him.\nPaul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind... yet...there were differences. He could see himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.\nAnd again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib. That must not happen, he told himself.\n“Is that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked.\n“Lam an Atreides,” Paul whispered, and then louder: “It’s not right that | give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could | be known among you as Paul-Muad’Dib?”\n“You are Paul-Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.\nAnd Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine. | did a different thing.\nBut he felt that the abyss remained all around him.\nAgain a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man: “Wisdom with strength...Couldn’t ask more...It’s the legend for sure...Lisan al-Gaib...Lisan al-Gaib....”\n“I will tell you a thing about your new name,” Stilgar said. “The choice pleases us. Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad’Dib creates his own water. Muad’Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad’Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad’Dib we call ‘instructor-of-boys.’ That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul- Muad’Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you.”\nStilgar touched Paul’s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, “Usul.”\nAs Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul, repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone: “Usul...Usul...Usul.” Already, he could place some of them by name. And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.\nPresently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: “Now, you are of the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother.” His face hardened, and he spoke with command in his voice. “And now, Paul-Muad’Dib, tighten up that stillsuit.” He glanced at Chani. “Chani! Paul-Muad’Dib’s nose plugs are as poor a fit I’ve ever seen! | thought | ordered you to see after him!”\n“I hadn’t the makings, Stil,” she said. “There’s Jamis’, of course, but—”\n“Enough of that!”\n“Then l'Il share one of mine,” she said. “I can make do with one until—”\n“You will not,” Stilgar said. “I know there are Spares among us. Where are the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of savages?”\nHands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar selected four, handed them to Chani. “Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina.”\nA voice lifted from the back of the troop: “What of the water, Stil? What of the literjons in their pack?”\n“I know your need, Farok,” Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.\n“Broach one for those that need it,” Stilgar said. “Watermaster...where is a watermaster? Ah,\nShimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed. The necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees.”\n“What is the repayment at field rates?” Jessica asked.\n“Ten for one,” Stilgar said.\n“But—”\n“It’s a wise rule as you'll come to see,” Stilgar said.\nA rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.\nStilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. “As to Jamis,” he said, “I order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his tahaddi-challenge. | invoke the rite...at sunset when the dark shall cover him.”\nPaul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss...blind time. There was no past occupying the future in his mind... except...except...he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving...somewhere ahead... still see the jihad’s bloody swords and fanatic legions.\nIt will not be, he told himself. / cannot let it be.\nGod created Arrakis to train the faithful.\n—FROM “THE WISDOM OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| n the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of his watchmen.\nThe great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave’s opening. She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in the dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had— the ability to sense even the slightest change in the air’S moisture.\nHow they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened! Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:\n“Ima trava okolo! | korenja okolo!”\nJessica translated silently: These are ashes! And these are roots!\nThe funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.\nShe looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky. Night was beginning\nto utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the dunes.\nYet the heat persisted.\nHeat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times.\nThirst.\nShe could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks...and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath’s moisture.\nThe suit itself was a sweatbox.\n“Your suit will be more comfortable when you've adjusted to a lower water content in your body,” Stilgar had said.\nShe knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind. No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.\nAnd that was a more subtle and profound matter.\nShe heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave’s depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.\nThere’s another thing, Jessica thought. Pau/ must be cautioned about their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine, yes, but not as wife.\nThen she wondered at herself, thinking: Have / been infected with his schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. / can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet...| was more than concubine.\n“Mother.”\nPaul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.\n“Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?”\nJessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. “I think so.”\n“Chani showed me...because I’m Supposed to see it and give my...permission for the weighing of the water.”\nJessica looked at Chani", " to see Paul come out of the cave’s depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.\nThere’s another thing, Jessica thought.

The flesh belongs to the person, but his water belongs to the tribe...except in the combat.”\n“They say the water’s mine,” Paul said.\nJessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.\n“Combat water belongs to the winner,” Chani said. “It’s because you have to fight in the open without stillsuits. The winner has to get his water back that he loses while fighting.”\n“| don’t want his water,” Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the inner eye. He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was\npositive: he did not want the water distilled out of Jamis’ flesh.\n“It’s...water,” Chani said.\nJessica marveled at the way she said it. “Water.” So much meaning in a simple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica’s mind: “Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.” And Jessica thought: Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters...if we’re to survive.\n“You will accept the water,” Jessica said.\nShe recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once with Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his Support in a questionable venture—because money maintained power for the Atreides.\nOn Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.\nPaul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered—not because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice had forced him to reevaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.\nPresently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh’s O.C. Bible. He said: “From water does all life begin.”\nJessica stared at him. Where did he learn that quotation? she asked herself. He hasn’t studied the mysteries.\n“Thus it is sooken,” Chani said. “Giudichar mantene: It is written in the Shah-Nama that water was the first of all things created.”\nFor no reason she could explain (and this bothered her more than the sensation), Jessica suddenly\nshuddered. She turned away to hide her confusion and was just in time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.\n“It is time!”\nThe voice was Stilgar’s ringing in the cavern. “Jamis’ weapon has been killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained the phases for the moons that daily wane and—in the end— appear as bent and withered twigs.” Stilgar’s voice lowered. “Thus it is with Jamis.”\nSilence fell like a blanket on the cavern.\nJessica saw the gray-shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within the dark inner reaches. She glanced back at the basin, sensing the coolness.\n“The friends of Jamis will approach,” Stilgar said.\nMen moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave. Its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.\nChani took a step away as though pulled by the light.\nJessica bent close to Paul’s ear, speaking in the family code: “Follow their lead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of Jamis.”\nIt will be more than that, Paul thought. And he felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and render it motionless.\nChani glided back to Jessica’s side, took her hand. “Come, Sayyadina. We must sit apart.”\nPaul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt abandoned.\nThe men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.\n“Come, Usul.”\nHe allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.\nThe troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with the movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at his neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar’s feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric.\n“The spirit leaves the body’s water when the first moon rises,” Stilgar intoned. “Thus it is sooken. When we see the first moon rise this night, whom will it summon?”\n“Jamis,” the troop responded.\nStilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of faces. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the hawk plane stooped upon us at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety.”\nHe bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. “I take this robe as a friend of Jamis—leader’s right.” He draped the robe over a shoulder, straightening.\nNow, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center, the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty Sheath, a folded pack, a paracompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of bundled feathers...and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.\nSo Jamis played the baliset, Paul thought. The Instrument reminded him of Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory of the future in the past that some chance-lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the reunions were few and shadowed. They puzzled him. The uncertainty factor touched him with wonder. Does it mean that something I will do...that | may do, could destroy Gurney...or bring him back to life...or....\nPaul swallowed, shook his head.\nAgain, Stilgar bent over the mound.\n“For Jamis’ woman and for the guards,” he said. The small rocks and the book were taken into the folds of his robe.\n“Leader's right,” the troop intoned.\n“The marker for Jamis’ coffee service,” Stilgar said, and he lifted a flat disc of green metal. “That it Shall be given to Usul in suitable ceremony when we return to the sietch.”\n“Leader's right,” the troop intoned.\nLastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it. “For the funeral plain,” he said.\n“For the funeral plain,” the troop responded.\nAt her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the ancient source of the rite, and she thought: The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture—it begins in the dignity with which we treat our dead. She looked across at Paul, wondering: Will he see it? Will he know what to do?\n“We are friends of Jamis,” Stilgar said. “We are not wailing for our dead like a pack of garvarg.”\nA gray-bearded man to Paul’s left stood up. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans. “When our water went below minim at the siege at Two Brids, Jamis shared.” The man returned to his place in the circle.\nAm I supposed to say | was a friend of Jamis? Paul wondered. Do they expect me to take something from that pile? He saw faces turn toward him, turn away. They do expect it!\nAnother man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the paracompass. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the patrol caught us at Bight-of-the-Cliff and | was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved.” He returned to his place in the circle.\nAgain, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them, lowered his eyes. An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: “Would you bring the destruction on us?”\nHow can I say I was his friend? Paul wondered.\nAnother figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded face came into the light, he recognized his mother. She removed a kerchief from\nthe mount. “I was a friend of Jamis,” she said. “When the spirit of spirits within him saw the needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son.” She returned to her place.\nAnd Paul recalled the scorn in his mother’s voice as she had confronted him after the fight. “How does it feel to be a killer?”\nAgain, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in the troop. A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on “The Cult of the Dead” flickered through Paul’s mind. He knew what he had to do.\nSlowly, Paul got to his feet.\nA sigh passed around the circle.\nPaul felt the diminishment of his se/fas he advanced into the center of the circle. It was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here. He bent over the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged softly as it struck against something in the pile.\n“I was a friend of Jamis,” Paul whispered.\nHe felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice. “Jamis taught me...that...when you kill...you pay for it. | wish I’d known Jamis better.”\nBlindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock floor.\nA voice hissed: “He sheds tears!”\nIt was taken up around the ring: “Usul gives moisture to the dead!”\nHe felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.\nJessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears. She focused on the words: “He gives moisture to the dead.” It was a gift to the shadow world—tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.\nNothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate value of water. Not the water- sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a Substance more precious than all others—it was life itself and entwined", " kill...you pay for it. | wish I’d known Jamis better.”\nBlindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock floor.\nA voice hissed: “He sheds tears!”\nIt was taken up around the ring: “Usul gives moisture to the dead!”\nHe felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.\nJessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears.

Not the water- sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a Substance more precious than all others—it was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism and ritual.\nWater.\n“I touched his cheek,” someone whispered. “I felt the gift.”\nAt first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul. He clutched the cold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm. Then he saw the faces beyond the groping hands—the eyes wide and wondering.\nPresently, the hands withdrew. The funeral ceremony resumed. But now there was a subtle Space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop honored him by a respectful isolation.\nThe ceremony ended with a low chant:\n“Full moon calls thee—\nShai-hulud shalt thou see;\nRed the night, dusky sky,\nBloody death didst thou die.\nWe pray to a moon: she is round—\nLuck with us will then abound, What we seek for shall be found In the land of solid ground.”\nA bulging sack remained at Stilgar’s feet. He crouched, placed his palms against it. Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul recognized Chani’s face in the hood shadow.\n“Jamis carried thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms of the tribe’s water,” Chani said. “I bless it now in the presence of a Sayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water, fillissin- follasy of Paul-Muad’Dib! Kivi a-kavi, never the more, nakalas! Nakelas! to be measured and counted, ukair- an! by the heartbeats jan-jan-jan of our friend... Jamis.”\nIn an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, Stared at Paul. Presently she said: “Where | am flame be thou the coals. Where | am dew be thou the water.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.\n“To Paul-Muad’Dib goes this portion,” Chani said. “May he guard it for the tribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with it in time of need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.\nI must accept that water, Paul thought. Slowly, he arose, made his way to Chani’s side. Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently from his hand.\n“Kneel,” Chani said.\nPaul knelt.\nShe guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient surface. “With this water the tribe entrusts thee,” she said. “Jamis is gone from it. Take it in peace.” She stood, pulling Paul up with her.\nStilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in one palm. Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the light of the glowglobe reflected off them.\nChani took the largest ring, held it on a finger. “Thirty liters,” she said. One by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them. “Two liters; one liter; seven watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of three-thirty-seconds drachms. In all—thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.”\nShe held them up on her finger for Paul to see.\n“Do you accept them?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul swallowed, nodded. “Yes.”\n“Later,” Chani said, “I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they won't rattle and give you away when you need silence.” She extended her hand.\n“Will you...hold them for me?” Paul asked.\nChani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.\nHe smiled, said, “Paul-Muad’Dib who is Usul does not yet know our ways, Chani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it’s time to show him the manner of carrying them.”\nShe nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the rings onto it with an\nintricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then stuffed them into the sash beneath her robe.\nI missed something there, Paul thought. He sensed the feeling of humor around him, something bantering in it, and his mind linked up a prescient memory: watercounters offered to a woman— courtship ritual.\n“Watermasters,” Stilgar said.\nThe troop arose in a hissing of robes. Two men stepped out, lifted the waterbag. Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the depths of the cave.\nPaul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over rock walls, the way the shadows danced, and he felt the troop’s lift of spirits contained in a hushed air of expectancy.\nJessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around by jostling bodies, Suppressed a moment of panic. She had recognized fragments of the ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani Jib in the words, and she knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple moments.\nJan-jan-jan, she thought. Go-go-go.\nIt was like a child’s game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.\nStilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall. He pressed an outcropping and the wall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack. He led the way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air across Paul when he passed it.\nPaul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. “That air felt damp,” he said.\n“Sh-h-h-h,” she whispered.\nBut a man behind them said: “Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight. Jamis’ way of telling us he’s satisfied.”\nJessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind. She saw how the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the air as she came opposite it.\nWindtrap! she thought. They’ve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface to funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from it.\nThey passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the door closed behind them. The draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of moisture clearly perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.\nAt the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgar’s hands dropped below the level of the heads in front of Paul. Presently he felt steps beneath his feet, curving down to the left. Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps.\nJessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.\nThe steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light of the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling.\nPaul felt Chani’s hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill air, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of water.\n| have seen this place in a dream, he thought.\nThe thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him on this path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his name. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror. Wild legions would charge into battle screaming their war cry: “Muad’Dib!”\nIt must not be, he thought. / cannot let it happen.\nBut he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut. It was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this instant, the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and now— himself and his mother included—could stop the thing.\nPaul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed him forward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the barrier in the glow of Stilgar’s globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water. It stretched away into shadows— deep and black—the far wall only faintly visible, perhaps a hundred meters away.\nJessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its\ndeepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.\nA splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen, saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a round gray eye above the pool’s rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it, saw the pointer stop at thirty-three liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.\nSuperb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought. And she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water’s passage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a profound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.\nJessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar’s side. Way was made for her with casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul’s eyes, but the mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts.\nStilgar looked at her. “There were those among us in need of water,” he said, “yet they would come here and not touch this water. Do you know that?”\n“I believe it,” she said.\nHe looked at the pool. “We have more than thirty- eight million decaliters here,” he said. “Walled off from the little makers, hidden and preserved.”\n“A treasure trove,” she said.\nStilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes. “It is greater than treasure. We have thousands of such\ncaches. Only a few of us know them all.” He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow- Shadowed glow across face and beard. “Hear that?”\nThey listened.\nThe dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.\nTo Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing through him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move.\n“It has been calculated with precision,” Stilgar whispered. “We know to within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis.”\nA hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: “Bi-lal kaifa.”\n“We will"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_d6fcf39c005ebf7c8b6e2fff131f337db83140f16132f390266d22d1289d7944_v2"}
