不。他在这孔贫寒的窑洞里，那么多地体验了从来没有体验过的温暖。是的，温暖。心灵的温暖。他每次坐到这个土炕上，一路奔波所带来的紧张和劳累立刻就会消失得一干二净，耳朵里再也听不见呼呼的风声和马达的轰鸣；疲倦的眼睛视线可以放心地重迭在一起，甚至可以闭目养神。僵直的胳膊腿松驰了下来；浑身的骨头也可以一块一块散乱地堆垒着——那种舒坦和轻松，就象躺在澡盆的热水里一般……唉，一旦他坐在这个热炕头上，他就不想再离开这里了！他清楚这一切意味着什么。 \n　　是的，不必隐讳，他在心里开始爱上了他的同学——这个苦命的寡妇！ \n　　我们知道，从田润生的家境来说，虽然不可能找个端公家饭碗的城里姑娘，但要在农村找个对象，那的确不必发愁；甚至可以有挑有拣。远处不说，东拉河一道沟的村庄，谁家不愿把女儿嫁给赫赫有名的田福堂的儿子呢？ \n　　可是，人的感情，尤其男女之间的感情，是世界上最难解释的一种现象。 \n　　现在，在田润生的眼里，只有这个寡妇才是他最可心的女人。 \n　　在高中上学的几年里，润生尽管和她是同班，但相互间的交往倒很一般。他是一个晚熟的青年，那时还对男女之间的事并不敏感。至于郝红梅，他只知道她家成份是地主，但光景很穷，本人常面黄饥瘦，穿身破衣服，连个丙菜也吃不起。后来他隐隐地听别人说，他们村的少平和这个女同学有“关系”…… \n　　以后他又听说，他们班的班长顾养民爱上了红梅。这倒使他大吃一惊。他想不到家庭和本人都很出众的班长竟然看上了这个成分不好、家境又困苦的女生。那时他才稍微留意了一下这个郝红梅。他似乎也发现，她是班里女生中最漂亮的……毕业以后，同学们都各自东西，他也就不再记得这些事了…… \n　　至于他自己，是这两年才多少懂到了一点所谓“爱情”——在很大程度上是由于姐姐和姐夫之间的不幸婚姻，迫使他也考虑起了他自己的事。是的，男大当婚，他也将要面临这件人生大事了。姐姐和姐夫的教训是深刻的，他决不能象他们一样。 \n　　润生在姑娘面前生性腼腆和胆怯，加之目睹了姐夫的不幸与痛苦，使他对女性产生了某种恐惧心理，他在有女人的地方立刻感到一种不自在，因此经常回避和女的接触。这同时造成了一种逆反心理；越是躲避女人，就越觉得女人的神秘；越是感到神秘，内心就越强烈地渴望得到女人的温�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
