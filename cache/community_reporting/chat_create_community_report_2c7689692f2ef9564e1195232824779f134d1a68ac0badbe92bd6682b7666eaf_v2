He is seven years younger than the narrator, which adds a layer of complexity to their relationship. The narrator expresses a deep concern for his brother's safety, indicating that he perceives him as a vulnerable figure within their family context. This concern is heightened by the belief that the brother is under threat, which suggests a protective instinct from the narrator.\n\nTragically, the younger brother is killed, an event that profoundly impacts the narrator. The narrator attributes this act to a malevolent force, specifically referring to it as the work of a \"\"魔鬼\"\" (devil), which underscores the emotional turmoil and horror surrounding the incident. This narrative aligns with a significant plot point in the story of \"\"弗兰肯斯坦\"\" (Frankenstein), where the creature, often referred to as a monster, is responsible for the death of the brother. This event is pivotal in the storyline, marking a turning point that drives the narrator's actions and emotions throughout the tale.\n\nIn summary, the younger brother is a vital character whose life and untimely death are central to the narrator's experiences and the overarching themes of vulnerability, familial bonds, and the struggle against malevolent forces.
