\n　　福堂自己也说不清这碾盘的历史，在他记事的时候，他们家用的就是这块碾盘。据他早已死去的父亲说，他也不知道这碾盘最早在什么时候使用的。那么，其历史最少可以追溯到福堂爷爷的手里。 \n　　不过，关于这块碾盘，福堂还记得，四七年国民党军队进攻到这里，胡宗南将军的士兵曾在这碾盘上用美国人的面粉烙过饼子。这件事是后来听他爷爷说的。那时他二十一岁，和父母都跑到哭咽河后沟的山崖窑躲避战乱。爷爷和奶奶死活不走，他们非要留下看家不行。记得老奶奶还用灶里的炉灰把脸抹得看了叫人恶心——她怕白军欺负。听爷爷说，那些军队就在这碾盘下烧起火，在上面烙了一整天洋面饼子，还给爷爷吃过几块，当这些士兵用他们家的尿盆盛菜时，爷爷对他们说，这是尿盆。结果一个戴大盖帽的军官扇了他一记耳光，吼叫道：“老子还没吃饭，你就要盆……” \n　　十几年前，这块碾盘终于在他手里用坏了。碾盘的一边掉了一大块——也许这碾盘的毁坏应该由胡宗南将军负责。 \n　　碾盘坏了后，福堂只好把它搬弃到现在这地方，另外又请米家镇的石匠打了块新的——原来的滚石仍然可以用，他现在用的碾子是新旧配套而成。 \n　　自从他的身体彻底垮掉以后，这块当年丢弃在这里的破碾盘，就成了他生活中的重要伙伴，他本人的境况似乎和这破碾盘差不多，也是被丢弃在这里的。 \n　　在白天悠长的日子里，只要有太阳，他就一直躺在这碾盘上，即是冬天，外面天气稍微暖和一些，他也要拿块狗皮褥子垫到上面，长久地仰卧在这里……此刻，一轮咳嗽刚刚平息，他发了一会呆，便又躺在了碾盘上。他半闭着眼睛，在阳光热烘烘的烤晒下，似乎进入了一种无意识状态。 \n　　其实，在他瘦弱胸脯下面，心潮却在滚滚不息地涌动着。外动内静，外静内动，永远如此。只要咳嗽平息，思绪接着便会活跃起来。现有，反来覆去思考的不再是“革命运动”。而是自己儿女的事。 \n　　在很大程度上，他正是被家庭接二连三的灾难彻底击倒在这块破碾盘上的。当润生突然提出要和一个有孩子的寡妇成亲时，他就对这打击招架不住了。在此之前，女�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>福堂<|>PERSON<|>福堂 is a
