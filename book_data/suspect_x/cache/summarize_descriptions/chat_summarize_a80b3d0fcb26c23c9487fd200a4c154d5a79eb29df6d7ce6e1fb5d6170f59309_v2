She actively amplifies Teg's Mentat capabilities to serve the Sisterhood's strategic objectives, leveraging his talents for their broader plans. However, Taraza is also wary of Teg's unpredictable behavior, which introduces uncertainty into his role within the Bene Gesserit's carefully orchestrated schemes.  \n\nRecognizing the grave threat posed by the Honored Matres, Taraza meticulously instructs and manipulates Teg to ensure he comprehends the dangers they present. Her guidance is both calculated and necessary, as Teg's unique skills make him a critical asset in confronting this existential threat. Despite her concerns about his unpredictability, Taraza remains committed to refining Teg's abilities and aligning his actions with the Sisterhood's long-term goals.  \n\nIn summary, Taraza's relationship with Teg is one of mentorship, manipulation, and cautious reliance.
