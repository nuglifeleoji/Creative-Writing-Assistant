靖子很困惑，她做梦也没想过这个问题。\n    “您为何要问这种事？”\n    “这个嘛……”汤川边走边凝视着她，“因为他是我的朋友，很重要的朋友，所以我想知道发生了什么事。”\n    “可是他和我的接触，根本没什么大不了――”\n    “对他来说应该很重要，”汤川说，“非常重要。这点您应该也明白。”\n    看到他真挚的眼神，靖子莫名所以地起了鸡皮疙瘩。她终于醒悟，此人知道石神对她怀有好感，所以他想弄清楚是什么起因让石神喜欢上她。\n    想到这里，靖子才发觉自己一次也没想过这个问题。不过她比任何人都清楚，她并非那种美得足以令人一见钟情的绝色美女。\n    靖子摇摇头。\n    “我什么也想不起来，因为我真的没和石神先生说过几句话。”\n    “是吗？说不定，还真的就是这样。”汤川的语气变得比较柔和了，“您觉得他怎么样？”\n    “啊……？”\n    “您应该不至于没察觉他的心意吧？关于这点，您有什么想法？”\n    这个唐突的问题令她困惑，当下的气氛也不容她笑着敷衍了事。\n    “我对他倒是没什么特别想法……只是觉得他是个好人，头脑非常聪明。”\n    “您是说，您知道他头脑聪明，是个好人？”汤川停下脚。\n
