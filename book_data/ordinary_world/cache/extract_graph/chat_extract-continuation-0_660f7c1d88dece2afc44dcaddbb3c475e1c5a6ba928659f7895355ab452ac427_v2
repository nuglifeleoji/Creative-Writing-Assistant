\n　　两口子半天才反应过来，紧接着把那二十五元工钱和他让出来的五元钱拿起来，争抢着给他手里塞。 \n　　但孙少平说什么也没有接。 \n　　少平带着六十元工钱，带着一种心灵上的满足，象其他工匠一样，即刻就去收拾自己的铺盖。书记两口子撵到那个敞口子烂窑里，硬要挽留他再做几天活——少平知道，这家人实际上已经不需工匠了；他们留他“干活”，无非是想借此多给他开一些工钱。但他再不会在此逗留，他觉得现在这样离开这家人最好了！ \n　　当天下午，孙少平就告别了曹书记一家人。因为他当时还没个去处，只好又来到他的远亲舅舅马顺家里。但是，他舅一家人接待他太勉强了。两口子都黑丧着脸，几乎把他看成了上门讨吃的叫化子。 \n　　唉，出门人不仅要忍受熬苦，还得要忍受屈辱，他为讨得他舅和他妗子的欢心，又故伎重演，赶忙提了桶担去给这家人担水。 \n　　他舅他妗子对他的殷勤照样没有表现出什么好感来；也许他们认为，一个揽工小子就应该在他们的白眼中见活就干！ \n　　少平怀着一种难言的痛苦来到沟底的水井上。绞水的时候，由于他一只手有伤，没把握住，辘轳把一下子脱手而飞，把他的另一只手也打破了！他顾不得擦手上的血，先拼命把两桶水提上来。 \n　　手上的疼痛使他的心中涌起了一股愤怒的情绪。为了止血，他竟忍不住把那只流血的手猛一下插进了一桶水中。血止住后，他索性赌气担起这担水往他舅家走去。哼，让他们喝他的血吧！ \n　　爬到半坡上时，少平感觉自己太过份了。他所具有的文化素养使他意识到他的行为是野蛮的，一刹那间，对别人的不满意和对自己的不满意，使他忍不住两眼噙满了泪水。 \n　　他随即把那担掺和着他的血的水倒掉，重新到沟底的水井上担了两桶。 \n　　少平把他舅家的水瓮担满后，天已经快黑了。 \n　　但他看见，他舅家没有给他管饭的迹象，而且也不提让他晚上住在什么地方。第一次来的时候，尽管他妗子对他的态度象这次一样恶劣，但他舅还勉强过得去。可是现在，他舅和他妗子一样厌恶他了。 \n　　孙少平知道，这是因为书记家合拢口的时候，他曾经“揭发”过他，让他失了面子。 \n　　很明显，他不能在这家亲戚家住下去了。而且凑合一个晚上都不行——现在就得马上离开！ \n　　这没有什么可伤心的。他\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character who
