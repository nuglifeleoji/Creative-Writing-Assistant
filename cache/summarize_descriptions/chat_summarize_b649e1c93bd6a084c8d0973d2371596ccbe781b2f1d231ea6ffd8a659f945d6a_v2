Operated by the **Fremen**, the indigenous people of Arrakis, the vehicle is a mobile spice harvester capable of traversing the harsh desert terrain.  \n\nTo evade detection and protect against hostile forces, the **FACTORY CRAWLER** is often concealed during **windstorms**, leveraging the planet's extreme weather conditions as cover. This stealth tactic ensures the Fremen can harvest spice without interference from rival factions or imperial forces.  \n\nCombining its roles as both a **mining vehicle** and a **strategic asset**, the **FACTORY CRAWLER** plays a crucial part in the Fremen's spice-gathering operations, enabling them to sustain their society while remaining hidden from enemies.
