His expertise in military strategies and campaigns was instrumental in shaping the defenses and offensive tactics of Wu, particularly in their efforts to counter the formidable warlord Cao Cao.\n\n周瑜's relationship with 孙权 was characterized by close collaboration and strategic discussions. One significant topic of their conversations was the implications of the marriage between 孙夫人 and 玄德, which highlighted the importance of alliances in their political landscape. This marriage was seen as a strategic alliance that could influence the balance of power among the rival states.\n\nAs a key military leader, 周瑜 was deeply involved in the decision-making processes that affected the Eastern Wu state. His contributions were not limited to battlefield tactics; he also engaged in high-level discussions with 孙权 regarding military strategies to effectively confront Cao Cao's forces. This partnership was vital for the survival and expansion of Wu during a tumultuous period marked by constant warfare and shifting allegiances.\n\nIn summary, 周瑜 served under 孙权 as a critical figure in military leadership, providing strategic insights and guidance that were essential for the Eastern Wu kingdom's military endeavors.
