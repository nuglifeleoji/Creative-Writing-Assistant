操起军四十万来报赤壁之仇。孙权大惊，且按下荆州，商议拒敌曹操。人报长史张纮辞疾回家，今已病故，有哀书上呈。权拆视之，书中劝孙权迁居秣陵，言秣陵山川有帝王之气，可速迁于此，以为万世之业。孙权览书大哭，谓众官曰：“张子纲劝吾迁居秣陵，吾如何不从！”即命迁治建业，筑石头城。吕蒙进曰：“曹操兵来，可于濡须水口筑坞以拒之。”诸将皆曰：“上岸击贼，跣足入船，何用筑城？”蒙曰：“兵有利钝，战无必胜。如猝然遇敌，步骑相促，人尚不暇及水，何能入船乎？”权曰：“人无远虑，必有近忧。子明之见甚远。”便差军数万筑濡须坞。晓夜并工，刻期告竣。\n\n    却说曹操在许都，威福日甚。长史董昭进曰：“自古以来，人臣未有如丞相之功者，虽周公、吕望，莫可及也。栉风沐雨，三十余年，扫荡群凶，与百姓除害，使汉室复存。岂可与诸臣宰同列乎？合受魏公之位，加九锡以彰功德。”你道那九锡？一，车马（大辂、戎辂各一。大辂，金车也。戎辂，兵车也。玄牡二驷，黄马八匹。）二，衣服（衮冕之服，赤舄副焉。衮冕，王者之服。赤舄，朱履也。）三，乐悬（乐悬，王者之乐也。）四，朱户（居以朱户，红门也。）五，纳陛（纳陛以登。陛，阶也。）六，虎贲（虎贲三百人，守门之军也。）七，鈇钺（鈇钺各一。鈇，即斧也。钺，斧属。）八，弓矢（彤弓一，彤矢百。彤，赤色也。【左玄右旅去方】弓十，【左玄右旅去方】矢千。【左玄右旅去方】，黑色也。）九，秬鬯圭瓒（秬鬯一卣，圭瓒副焉。秬，黑黍也。鬯，香酒，灌地以求神于阴。卣，中樽也。圭瓒，宗庙祭器，以祀先王也。）侍中荀彧曰：“不可。丞相本兴义兵，匡扶汉室，当秉忠贞之志，守谦退之节。君子爱人以德，不宜如此。”曹操闻言，勃然变色。董昭曰：“岂可以一人而阻众望？”遂上表请尊操为魏公，加九锡。荀彧叹曰：“吾不想今日见此事！”操闻，深恨之，以为不助己也。建安十七年冬十月，曹操兴兵下江南，就命荀彧同行。彧已知操有杀己之心，托病止于寿春。忽曹操使人送饮食一盒至。盒上有操亲笔封记。开盒视之，并无一物。彧会其意，遂服毒而亡。年五十岁。后人\n######################\nOutput:",
