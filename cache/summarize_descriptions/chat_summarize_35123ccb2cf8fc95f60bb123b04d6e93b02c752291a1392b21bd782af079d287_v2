As part of Penguin Random House, BERKLEY has contributed to the publication of both past and current editions of Frank Herbert's acclaimed science fiction saga. The imprint is associated with the distribution and promotion of these titles, ensuring their availability to readers. While some descriptions note that BERKLEY \"published\" the *Dune* series (indicating past involvement), others clarify that it \"publishes\" the series (suggesting ongoing activity). This discrepancy likely reflects BERKLEY's continued role in reissuing or distributing editions of the *Dune* books over time. The imprint's connection to *God Emperor of Dune*, a specific installment in the series, further underscores its engagement with Herbert's universe.
