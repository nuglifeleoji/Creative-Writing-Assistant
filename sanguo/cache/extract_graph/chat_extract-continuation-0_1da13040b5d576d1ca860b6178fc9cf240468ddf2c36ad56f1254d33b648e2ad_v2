。两阵对圆，赵云出马唤彼将答话。曹仁命李典出阵，与赵云交锋。约战十数合，李典料敌不过，拨马回阵。云纵马追赶，两翼军射住，遂各罢兵归寨。李典回见曹仁，言：“彼军精锐，不可轻敌，不如回樊城。”曹仁大怒曰：“汝未出军时，已慢吾军心；今又卖阵，罪当斩首！”便喝刀斧手推出李典要斩；众将苦告方免。乃调李典领后军，仁自引兵为前部。次日鸣鼓进军，布成一个阵势，使人问玄德曰：“识吾阵势？”单福便上高处观看毕，谓玄德曰：“此八门金锁阵也。八门者：休、生、伤、杜、景、死、惊、开。如从生门、景门、开门而入则吉；从伤门、惊门、休门而入则伤；从杜门、死们而人则亡。今八门虽布得整齐，只是中间通欠主持。如从东南角上生门击人，往正西景门而出，其阵必乱。”玄德传令，教军士把住阵角，命赵云引五百军从东南而入，径往西出。云得令，挺枪跃马，引兵径投东南角上，呐喊杀入中军。曹仁便投北走。云不追赶，却突出西门，又从西杀转东南角上来。曹仁军大乱。玄德麾军冲击，曹兵大败而退。单福命休追赶，收军自回。却说曹仁输了一阵，方信李典之言；因复请典商议，言：“刘备军中必有能者，吾阵竟为所破。”李典曰：“吾虽在此，甚忧樊城。”曹仁曰：“今晚去劫寨。如得胜，再作计议；如不胜，便退军回樊城。”李典曰：“不可。刘备必有准备。”仁曰：“若如此多疑，何以用兵！”遂不听李典之言。自引军为前队，使李典为后应，当夜二更劫寨。\n\n
