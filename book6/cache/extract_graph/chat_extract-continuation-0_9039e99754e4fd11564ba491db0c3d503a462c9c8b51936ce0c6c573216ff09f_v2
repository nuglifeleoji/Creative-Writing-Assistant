雪地工程部署在太阳轨道上的三千六百一十四枚核弹。\n　　信号每秒钟发射一次，维持着这些核弹的非触发状态。如果我死去，摇篮系统的维持信号将消失，所有的核弹将被引爆，包裹核弹的油膜物质将在爆炸中形成围绕太阳的三千六百一十四团星际尘埃，从远方观察，在这些尘埃云团的遮挡下，太阳将在可见光和其他高频渡段发生闪烁。太阳轨道上所有核弹的位置都是经过精心布置的，使得太阳闪烁形成的信号发送出三张简单的图形，就像我两个世纪前发出的那三张图一样，每张上面有三十个点的排列，并标注其中一个点，它们可以组合成一个三维坐标图。但与那次不同的是，这次发送的，是三体世界与周围三十颗恒星的相对位置。太阳将变成银河系中的一座灯塔，把这咒语发送出去，当然，太阳系和地球的位置也会同时暴露。从银河系中的一点看，图形发射完成需要一年多的时间，但应该有很多技术发展到这样程度的文明，可以从多个方向同时观测太阳，那样的话，只需几天甚至几个小时，他们就能得到全部信息。“\n　　随着天光渐明，星星在一颗颗消失，仿佛无数只眼睛渐次闭上；而东方正在亮起的晨空，则像一只巨大的眼睛在慢慢睁开。蚂蚁继续在叶文洁的墓碑上攀爬着，穿行在她的名字构成的迷宫中。早在这个靠碑而立的豪赌者出现前的一亿年，它的种族已经生活在地球上，这个世界有它的一份，但对正在发生的事，它并不在意。\n　　罗辑离开墓碑，站到他为自己挖掘的墓穴旁，将手枪顶到自己的心脏位置，说：“现在，我将让自己的心脏停止跳动，与此同时我也将成为两个世界有史以来最大的罪犯。对于所犯下的罪行，我对两个文明表示深深的歉意，但不会忏悔，因为这是唯一的选择。我知道智子就在身边，但你们对人类的呼唤从不理睬，无言是最大的轻蔑，我们忍受这种轻蔑已经两个世纪了，现在，如果你们愿意，可以继续保持沉默，我只给你们三十秒钟时间。”\n　　罗辑按照自己的心跳来计时，由于现在心跳很急促。他把两次算一秒钟，在极度的紧张中他一开始就数错了，只好从头数起，所以当智子出现时他并不能确定到底过了多少时间，客观时间大约流逝了不到十秒钟，主观时间长得像一生。\n　　这时他看到世界在眼前分成了四份，一份是周围的现实世界，另外三份是变形的映像。映像来自他前上方突然出现的三个球体，它们都有着全反射的镜面，就像他在最后一个梦中见到的墓碑那样。他不知道这是智子的几维展开，那三个球体都很大，在他的前方遮住了半个天空，挡住了正在亮起来的东方天际，在球体中映出的西方天\n######################\nOutput:",
