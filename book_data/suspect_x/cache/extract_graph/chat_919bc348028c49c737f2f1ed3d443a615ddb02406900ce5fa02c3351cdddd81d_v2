There had been no warning, only the troops dropping in wide lines—a domino effect that left the survivors in shock. And Great Honored Matre obviously enjoyed the shock.\nLooking at Murbella, Great Honored Matre said, “So this is the bag of insolence you say you trained in your ways.”\nOdrade almost smiled at the description.\nBag of insolence?\nA Bene Gesserit would accept it without rancor. This rheumy-eyed Great Honored Matre faced a quandary and could not call on her weapon that killed without blood. Very delicate balance of power. Agitated conversations among Honored Matres had revealed their problem.\nAll of their secret weapons had been exhausted and could not be reloaded, something they had lost when driven back here.\n“Our weapon of last resort and we wasted it!”\nLogno, who thought herself supreme, stood in a different arena now. And she had just learned of the fearful ease with which Murbella could kill one of the elect.\nMurbella cast a measuring gaze over Great Honored Matre’s entourage, gauging their potentials. They recognized this situation, of course. Familiar. How did they vote?\nNeutral?\nSome were wary and all were waiting.\nAnticipating a diversion. No concern over who triumphed as long as power continued to flow in their direction.\nMurbella let her muscles flow into the waiting stance of combat she had learned from Duncan and the Proctors. She\nfelt as cool as though standing on the practice floor, running through responses. Even as she reacted, she knew she moved in ways for which Odrade had prepared her— mentally, physically, and emotionally.\nVoice first. Give them a taste of inner chill.\n“I see you have assessed the Bene Gesserit quite poorly. The arguments of which you are so proud, these women have heard them so many times your words go beyond boredom.”\nThis was delivered with scathing vocal control, a tone that brought orange to Logno’s eyes but held her motionless.\nMurbella was not through with her. “You consider yourself powerful and clever. One begets the other, eh? What idiocy! You're a consummate liar and you lie to yourself.”\nAs Logno remained motionless in the face of this attack, those around her began moving away, opening space that said, “She is all yours.”\n“Your fluency in these lies does not hide them,” Murbella said. She swept a scornful gaze across the ones behind Logno. “Like the ones I know in Other Memory, you are headed for extinction. The problem is that you take so infernally long dying. Inevitable but oh, the boredom meanwhile. You dare call yourself Great Honored Matre!” Returning her attention to Logno. “Everything about you is a cesspool. You have no style.”\nIt was too much. Logno attacked, left foot slashing outward with blinding speed. Murbella grasped the foot as she would catch a wind-blown leaf and, continuing the flow of it, levered Logno into a threshing club that ended with her head pulped on the floor. Without pausing, Murbella pirouetted, left foot almost decapitating the Honored Matre who had stood at Logno’s right, the right hand crushing the throat of the one who had stood at Logno’s left. It was over in two heartbeats.\nExamining the scene without breathing hard (to show how easy it was, Sisters), Murbella experienced a sense of shock\nand recognition of the inevitable. Odrade lay on the floor in front of Elpek, who obviously had chosen sides without hesitation. The twisted position of Odrade’s neck and flaccid appearance of her body said she was dead.\n“She tried to interfere,” Elpek said.\nHaving killed a Reverend Mother, Elpek expected Murbella (a Sister, after all!) to applaud. But Murbella did not react as expected. She knelt beside Odrade and put her head against that of the corpse, staying there an interminable time.\nThe surviving Honored Matres exchanged questioning looks but dared not move.\nWhat is this?\nBut they were immobilized by Murbella’s terrifying abilities.\nWhen she had Odrade’s recent past, all of the new added to previous Sharing, Murbella stood.\nElpek saw death in Murbella’s eyes and took one backward step before trying to defend herself. Elpek was dangerous but no match for this demon in the black robe. It was over with the same shocking abruptness that had taken Logno and her aides: a kick to the larynx. Elpek sprawled across Odrade.\nOnce more, Murbella studied the survivors, then stood a moment looking down at Odrade’s body.\nIn a way, that was my doing, Dar. And yours!\nShe shook her head from side to side, absorbing consequences.\nOdrade is dead. Long live Mother Superior! Long live Great Honored Matre! And may the heavens protect us all.\nShe gave her attention then to what must be done. These deaths had created an enormous debt. Murbella took a deep breath. This was another Gordian knot.\n“Release Teg,” she said. “Clean up in here as quickly as possible. And somebody get me a proper robe!”\nIt was Great Honored Matre giving orders but those who leaped to obey sensed the Other in her.\nThe one who brought her a red robe elaborate with soostone dragons held it deferentially from a distance. Large woman with heavy bones and square face. Cruel eyes.\n“Hold it for me,” Murbella said and when the woman tried to take advantage of proximity to attack her, Murbella dumped the woman hard. “Try again?”\nThis time there were no tricks.\n“You are the first member of my Council,” Murbella said. “Name?”\n“Angelika, Great Honored Matre.” See! / was first to call you by your proper title. Reward me.\n“Your reward is that | promote you and let you live.”\nProper Honored Matre response. Accepted as such.\nWhen Teg came to her rubbing his arms where the shigawire had bitten deep, some Honored Matres tried to caution Murbella. “Do you know what this one can—”\n“He serves me now,” Murbella interrupted. Then in Odrade’s mocking tones: “Isn’t that right, Miles?”\nHe gave her a rueful smile, an old man on a child’s face. “Interesting times, Murbella.”\n“Dar liked apples,” Murbella said. “See to that.”\nHe nodded. Return her to a cemetery orchard. Not that prized Bene Gesserit orchards would endure long ina desert. Still, some traditions were worth perpetuating while you could.\nWhat do Holy Accidents teach? Be resilient. Be strong. Be ready for change, for the new. Gather many experiences and judge them by the steadfast nature of our faith.\n—TLEILAXU DOCTRINE\nWe\"! within Teg’s original timetable, Murbella picked her Honored Matre entourage and returned to Chapterhouse. She expected certain problems and the messages she sent ahead paved the way for solutions.\n“I bring Futars to attract Handlers. Honored Matres fear a biological weapon from the Scattering that made vegetables of them. Handlers may be the source.”\n“Prepare to keep Rabbi and party in no-ship. Honor their secrecy. And remove the protective mines from the ship!” (That went in keeping of a Proctor messenger.)\nShe was tempted to ask for her children but that was non-Bene Gesserit. Someday . .. maybe.\nImmediately on returning, she had Duncan to accommodate and this confused Honored Matres. They were as bad as the Bene Gesserit. “What’s so special about one man?”\nNo longer a reason for him to remain in the ship but he refused to leave. “I’ve a mental mosaic to assemble: a piece that cannot be moved, extraordinary behavior, and willing participation in their dream. | must find limits to test. That’s missing. | know how to find it. Get in tune. Don’t think; do it.”\nIt made no sense. She humored him although he was changed. A stability to this new Duncan that she accepted as a challenge. By what right did he assume a self-satisfied\nair? No... not self-satisfied. It was more being at peace with a decision. He refused to share it!\n“I’ve accepted things. You must do the same.”\nShe had to admit this described what she was doing.\nOn her first morning back, she arose at dawn and entered the workroom. Wearing the red robe, she sat in Mother Superior’s chair and summonded Bellonda.\nBell stood at one end of the worktable. She knew. The design became clear in execution. Odrade had imposed a debt on her as well. Thus, the silence: assessing how she must pay.\nService to this Mother Superior, Bell! That is how you pay. No Archival declension of these events will put them into proper perspective. Action Is required.\nBellonda spoke finally. “The only crisis I’d care to compare with this one is the advent of the Tyrant.”\nMurbella reacted sharply. “Hold your tongue, Bell, unless you've something useful to say!”\nBellonda took the reprimand calmly (uncharacteristic response). “Dar had changes in mind. This what she expected?”\nMurbella softened her tone. “We'll rehash ancient history later. This is an opening chapter.”\n“Bad news.” That was the old Bellonda.\nMurbella said: “Admit the first group. Be cautious. They are Great Honored Matre’s High Council.”\nBell left to obey.\nShe knows I have every right to this position. They all know it. No need for a vote. No room for a vote!\nNow was the time for the historical art of politics she had learned from Odrade.\n“In all things you must appear important. No minor decisions pass through your hands unless they are quiet acts called ‘favors’ done for people whose loyalty can be earned.”\nEvery reward came from on high. Not a good policy with the Bene Gesserit but this group entering the workroom, they were familiar with a Patroness Great Honored Matre; they would accept “new political necessities.” Temporarily. It was always temporary, especially with Honored Matres.\nBell and watchdogs knew she would be a long time sorting this out. Even with amplified Bene Gesserit abilities.\nIt would require extremely demanding attention from all of them. And the first thing was the sharply discerning gaze of innocence.\nThat is what Honored Matres lost, and we must restore it before they can fade into the background where “we” belong.\nBellonda ushered in the Council and retired silently.\nMurbella waited until they were seated. A mixed lot: some aspirants to supreme power. Angelika there smiling so prettily. Some waiting (not even daring to hope yet) but gathering what they could.\n“Our Sisterhood was acting with stupidity,” Murbella accused. She noted the ones who took this angrily. “You would have killed the goose!”\nThey did not understand. She dredged up the parable. They listened with proper attention, even when she added: “Don’t you realize how desperately we need every one of these witches? We outnumber them so greatly that each of them will carry an enormous teaching burden!”\nThey considered this and, bitter though it was, they were forced to a qualified acceptance because she said it.\nMurbella hammered it home. “Not only am I your Great Honored Matre ... Does anyone question that?”\nNo one questioned.\n“but | am Bene Gesserit Mother Superior. They can do little else but confirm me in office.”\nTwo of them\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_919bc348028c49c737f2f1ed3d443a615ddb02406900ce5fa02c3351cdddd81d_v2"}
