隐匿在黑暗之中。雨水浸泡了的青草散发出一股甜丝丝的味道，直往鼻子里钻。这里那里，归窝的鸟儿扑楞楞地扇动着翅膀。她在熟悉的路径上慢慢踱着步。她什么也不怕：不怕狼，不怕鬼，不怕黑暗。 \n　　她的遭遇已经够坏的了。还怕什么更坏的遭遇吗？她走着，在黑暗中惆怅地张望着。她总想看见点什么，但什么也看不见，她站在住了，索性闭上眼睛。她最怕回忆过去，但过去的生活画面总是在这样的时候就出现在眼前，初春明丽的阳光，那么和煦地照耀着绿茵茵的草地，她依偎在妈妈的怀中，脚搁在爸爸的膝盖上，在画夹的宣纸上写生——嫩黄的柳丝，碧澄的湖水，白的耀眼的塔尖……雨渐渐大起来，并且起风了。黑暗中，风雨无情地抽打着她发烫的脸颊，湿透了的衣服冰凉地贴在身上，痛苦难耐。她对着黑洞洞的天地绝望地狂喊了一声：“啊——啊——啊——啊——”黑暗中的千山万壁，久久地回应着她的呼号。“小吴！” \n　　背后突然有人叫她。她的脊背骨一阵冰凉，下意识地猛转过身，紧张地问：“谁？” \n　　“我……运生。你快回喀！天这么黑，又下雨……” \n　　当她确实听清了这是队长的声音，全身才松弛下来。“给，把我的草帽戴上。”运生在黑暗中把草帽递过来，又一次央求似地说：“快回喀……” \n　　她接过草帽，无言地迈动了脚步。接着，她后面也响起了“扑踏扑踏”的脚步声。 \n　　这时候，她才突然感到这黑暗的荒沟恐怖极了，好像四面八方都埋伏着龇牙咧嘴的魔鬼在伺机向她扑来。但她觉得有一种力量在保护着她。这就是身后“扑踏扑踏”的脚步声，它像避邪的战鼓那般有神威。她那顶草帽一直没往头上戴，紧紧地捏在手里；她觉得这不是草帽，而是运生交给她的一把护身剑。 \n　　风雨越来越猛烈了，整个天地间就只有风雨这单调而复杂的声音。不久，渠渠沟沟里响起了淙淙的流水声。村前河道里的涛声也陡然间涨高了。她一边跌跌撞撞地走着，一边问：“运生，你怎知道我在这里呢？” \n　　运生在离她不远的背后回答：“不光今天，你每次来这荒沟我都知道。我常在那小土梁梁后面哩，怕你……小吴，你可千万、千万不要往窄处想哇！今天我知道冯书记叫你去了\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>小吴<|>PERSON<|>小吴
