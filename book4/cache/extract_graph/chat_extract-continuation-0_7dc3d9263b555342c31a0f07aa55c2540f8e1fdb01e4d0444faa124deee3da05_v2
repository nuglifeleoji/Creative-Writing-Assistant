\n　　“咱们就那么几双鞋，破了再买新的，何必专门买个工具钉呢！” \n　　“我不是要钉咱们的鞋。我准备学会钉鞋后，办个营业执照，到街上去做这营生……” \n　　啊啊，原来是这样！ \n　　润叶这才恍然大悟。她走过来，手托在丈夫轮椅的扶手上，惊讶地看着他，问：“你这是为什么？” \n　　向前仍然低垂着头，说：“看咱们的乐乐出生后，我感到幸福，又感到痛苦。幸福在于我有了儿子。我想不到自己成了这个样子，还会有这么大的福气……“可是我心里又太痛苦了，我是这样一个废物父亲！叶，一个不能养活自己孩子的父亲，有什么脸面对孩子！有什么脸活在这世上？再说，我父母亲总有一天会离开人世间，到时，怎么能让你一个人养活我和孩子呢？想到这些，我的心就象锥扎一般！”因此，我盘算来盘算去，总得要学着做个什么，赚点钱，也减轻你的一些负担。我寻思，其它活我干不成，但钉鞋主要靠两只手而不需要动腿；我的两只手劲大着哩，这你也知道……所以我瞒着你和父母，偷着让人买了钉鞋工具，在家里先练着……” \n　　润叶蹲在他面前，两只手搭在他的断腿上，静静地听他说。她看见，丈夫说话的时候，眼里噙着泪水。“你不要这样，”她说。“到任何时候，我都能养活了你和孩子。你现在身体不行，能帮我料理点家务就满好了。”“我知道，你和我父母亲都不愿我去干这营生！你们都是领导人，有身份的人，而我却蹲在街头当个钉鞋匠，会给你们丢脸的……可是，我再干不了其它活哇！叶，让我一辈子这样闲呆着，还不如让我一死了事！”向前的脸在骤烈地抽搐着，扭向了一边。 \n　　润叶被他的痛苦深深触动了。她完全能理解丈夫的心情。他感到这样活着是一种屈辱，他是个男人，不劳动而靠老婆养活，便失去了活人的尊严。是的，尊严，只有劳动才能使人尊严地活着啊！ \n　　她应该支持他？ \n　　还用说吗？当然应该支持！这劳动对他来说，已不仅是一般意义上的生存需要，而是在体现一个人生命的价值！她用手拢了拢他额前的头发，说：“别担心，我给他们做工作……” \n　　这时候，她站起来，说：“走，让我看看你把我那双鞋破坏成啥样了！” \n　　向前抬起头不好意思地笑了，说：“你要是迟回来十分钟，我就会把你的鞋重新钉好的。” \n　　于是，润叶推着丈夫，来到了客厅。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
