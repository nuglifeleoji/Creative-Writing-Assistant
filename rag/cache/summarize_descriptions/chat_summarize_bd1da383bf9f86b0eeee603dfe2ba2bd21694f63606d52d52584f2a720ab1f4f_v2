This technology was later adopted and repurposed by the Bene Gesserit, who integrated it into their own genetic and breeding programs. The Axolotl Tanks played a significant role in the potential origins of Duncan Idaho, a recurring figure in Bene Gesserit schemes, as they enabled the resurrection and manipulation of his genetic line. While initially a Tleilaxu innovation, the tanks became a shared tool between the two factions, reflecting the complex interplay of power and knowledge in their universe.
