\n　　这是一个伤感而断魂的季节……孙少平上井以后，洗完澡换好衣服，便一个人走出喧腾不息的矿区。他看起来比过去消瘦了一些，眼神和脸色却更加严峻，头发总是被汗水卷曲得零零乱乱。他匆忙而专注地走着。似乎要摆脱什么，抑或在寻找什么；又象是有谁在召唤他。 \n　　象通常那样，他从矿部那个小坡上走下来，走过黑水河上摇曳着绿枝的树桥，爬上了对面的山，不停留地一直走向山野深处。然后，他随意在某个无人处停下来，或坐，或躺，或久久地驻足而立。 \n　　多少日子来，他天天都是如此。 \n　　现在，已是下午了。他斜躺在一片草地上，出神地看着眼前几朵碎金似的小黄花。偏西的太阳温暖地照耀着山野。春风柔得似乎让人感觉不到。周围没有任何一点声响。过分的寂静中，他耳朵里产生了一种嗡嗡的声音。这声音好象来自宇宙深处，或沉闷，或尖锐，但从不间隔，象某种高速旋转的飞行器在运行。而且似乎就是向他飞来了。 \n　　他久久地躺着，又象往日那样，痛不欲生地想着他亲爱的晓霞，思维陷入到深远的冥想之中，眼前的景色渐渐变成了模糊的缤纷的一片，无数桔红色的光晕在这缤纷中静无声息地旋转。他看见了一些光点在其间聚集成线；点线又组成色块；这些色块在堆垒，最后渐渐显出了一张脸。他认出了这是晓霞的脸。她头稍稍偏歪着，淘气地对他笑。这张脸是有动感的，甚至眼睫毛的颤动都能感觉到。嘴在说着什么？但没有声音。这好象是她过去某个瞬间的形象……对了，是古塔山杜梨树下那次……他拼命向她喊叫，但发不出声音来。不然，她肯定会看见他的泪水了。无论怎样无声地喊叫，那张亲爱的笑脸随着色块的消失，最后消失在了那片缤纷之中…… \n　　不久，连这片缤纷也消失了。天空，山野，又恢复了原来的样子，他还斜躺在这块草地上。寂静。耳朵里又传来了那嗡嗡声。不过，这嗡嗡声似乎越来越近，并且夹带着哨音的尖锐呼啸。他猛然看见，山坳那边亮起一片橙光。那嗡嗡声正是发自那橙光。橙光在向他这边移来。他渐渐看清，橙光中有个象圆盘一样的物体，外表呈金属质�\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
