{"input": ["J'y suis, j'y reste!”\nThe Preacher sighed deeply. “How far has it gone, this thing you’ve done to yourself?”\n“My skin is not my own, father.”\nThe Preacher shuddered. “Then | know how you found me here.”\n“Yes, | fastened my memory to a place my flesh had never known,” Leto said. “I need an evening with my father.”\n“I’m not your father. I’m only a poor copy, a relic.” He turned his head toward the sound of the approaching guide. “I no longer go to the visions for my future.”\nAs he spoke, darkness covered the desert. Stars leaped out above them and Leto, too, turned toward the approaching guide. “Wubakh ul kuhar!” Leto called to the youth. “Greetings!”\nBack came the response: “Subakh un nar!”\nSpeaking in a hoarse whisper, The Preacher said: “That young Assan Tarig is a dangerous one.”\n“All of the Cast Out are dangerous,” Leto said. “But not to me.” He spoke in a low, conversational tone.\n“If that’s your vision, | will not share it,” The Preacher said.\n“Perhaps you have no choice,” Leto said. “You are the fil- haquiga, The Reality. You are Abu Dhur, Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time.”\n“I’m no more than bait in a trap,” The Preacher said, and his voice was bitter.\n“And Alia already has eaten that bait,” Leto said. “But | don’t like its taste.”\n“You cannot do this!” The Preacher hissed.\n“I’ve already done it. My skin is not my own.”\n“Perhaps it’s not too late for you to—”\n“It is too late.” Leto bent his head to one side. He could hear Assan Tarig trudging up the duneslope toward them, coming to the sound of their voices. “Greetings, Assan Tariq of Shuloch,” Leto said.\nThe youth stopped just below Leto on the slope, a dark shadow there in the starlight. There was indecision in the set of his shoulders, the way he tipped his head.\n“Yes,” Leto said, “I’m the one who escaped from Shuloch.”\n“When | heard...” The Preacher began. And again: “You cannot do this!”\n“I am doing it. What matter if you’re made blind once more?”\n“You think | fear that?” The Preacher asked. “Do you not see the fine guide they have provided for me?”\n“I see him.” Again Leto faced Tariq. “Didn’t you hear me, Assan? I’m the one who escaped from Shuloch.”\n“You're a demon,” the youth quavered.\n“Your demon,” Leto said. “But you are my demon.” And Leto felt the tension grow between himself and his father. It\nwas a Shadow play all around them, a projection of unconscious forms. And Leto felt the memories of his father, a form of backward prophecy which sorted visions from the familiar reality of this moment.\nTarig sensed it, this battle of the visions. He slid several paces backward down the slope.\n“You cannot control the future,” The Preacher whispered, and the sound of his voice was filled with effort as though he lifted a great weight.\nLeto felt the dissonance between them then. It was an element of the universe with which his entire life grappled. Either he or his father would be forced to act soon, making a decision by that act, choosing a vision. And his father was right: trying for some ultimate control of the universe, you only built weapons with which the universe eventually defeated you. To choose and manage a vision required you to balance on a single, thin thread—playing God on a high tightwire with cosmic solitude on both sides. Neither contestant could retreat into death-as- surcease-from- paradox. Each knew the visions and the rules. All of the old illusions were dying. And when one contestant moved, the other might countermove. The only real truth that mattered to them now was that which separated them from the vision background. There was no place of safety, only a transitory shifting of relationships, marked out within the limits which they now imposed and bound for inevitable changes. Each of them had only a desperate and lonely courage upon which to rely, but Leto possessed two advantages: he had committed himself upon a path from which there was no turning back, and he had accepted the terrible consequences to himself. His father still hoped there was a way back and had made no final commitment.\n“You must not! You must not!” The Preacher rasped.\nHe sees my advantage, Leto thought.\nLeto spoke in a conversational tone, masking his own tensions, the balancing effort this other-level contest\nrequired. “I have no passionate belief in truth, no faith other than what | create,” he said. And he felt then a movement between himself and his father, something with granular characteristics which touched only Leto’s own passionately subjective belief in himself. By such belief he knew that he posted the markers of the Golden Path. Someday such markers could tell others how to be human, a strange gift from a creature who no longer would be human on that day. But these markers were always set in place by gamblers. Leto felt them scattered throughout the landscape of his inner lives and, feeling this, poised himself for the ultimate gamble.\nSoftly he sniffed the air, seeking the signal which both he and his father knew must come. One question remained: Would his father warn the terrified young guide who waited below them?\nPresently Leto sensed ozone in his nostrils, the betraying odor of a shield. True to his orders from the Cast Out, young Tariq was trying to kill both of these dangerous Atreides, not knowing the horrors which this would precipitate.\n“Don’t,” The Preacher whispered.\nBut Leto knew the signal was a true one. He sensed ozone, but there was no tingling in the air around them. Tariq used a pseudo-shield in the desert, a weapon developed exclusively for Arrakis. The Holtzmann Effect would summon a worm while it maddened that worm. Nothing would stop such a worm—not water, not the presence of sandtrout... nothing. Yes, the youth had planted the device in the duneslope and was beginning to edge away from the danger zone.\nLeto launched himself off the dunetop, hearing his father scream in protest. But the awful impetus of Leto’s amplified muscles threw his body like a missile. One outflung hand caught the neck of Tariq’s stillsuit, the other slapped around to grip the doomed youth’s robe at the waist. There came a single snap as the neck broke. Leto rolled, lifting his body\nlike a finely balanced instrument which dove directly into the sand where the pseudo-shield had been hidden. Fingers found the thing and he had it out of the sand, throwing it in a looping arc far out to the south of them.\nPresently there came a great hissing-thrashing din out on the desert where the pseudo-shield had gone. It subsided, and silence returned.\nLeto looked up to the top of the dune where his father stood, still defiant, but defeated. That was Paul Muad’Dib up there, blind, angry, near despair as a consequence of his flight from the vision which Leto had accepted. Paul’s mind would be reflecting now upon the Zensunni Long Koan: “/n the one act of predicting an accurate future, Muad’Dib introduced an element of development and growth into the very prescience through which he saw human existence. By this, he brought uncertainty onto himself. Seeking the absolute of orderly prediction, he amplified disorder, distorted prediction.”\nReturning to the dunetop in a single leap, Leto said: “Now I’m your guide.”\n“Never!”\n“Would you go back to Shuloch? Even if they’d welcome you when you arrived without Tarig, where has Shuloch gone now? Do your eyes see it?”\nPaul confronted his son then, aiming the eyeless sockets at Leto. “Do you really know the universe you have created here?”\nLeto heard the particular emphasis. The vision which both of them knew had been set into terrible motion here had required an act of creation at a certain pointin time. For that moment, the entire sentient universe shared a linear view of time which possessed characteristics of orderly progression. They entered this time as they might step onto a moving vehicle, and they could only leave it the same way.\nAgainst this, Leto held the multi-thread reins, balanced in his own vision-lighted view of time as multilinear and multilooped. He was the sighted man in the universe of the blind. Only he could scatter the orderly rationale because his father no longer held the reins. In Leto’s view, a son had altered the past. And a thought as yet undreamed in the farthest future could reflect upon the now and move his hand.\nOnly his hand.\nPaul knew this because he no longer could see how Leto might manipulate the reins, could only recognize the inhuman consequences which Leto had accepted. And he thought: Here is the change for which I prayed. Why do I fear it? Because it’s the Golden Path!\n“I’m here to give purpose to evolution and, therefore, to give purpose to our lives,” Leto said.\n“Do you wish to live those thousands of years, changing as you now know you will change?”\nLeto recognized that his father was not speaking about physical changes. Both of them knew the physical consequences: Leto would adapt and adapt; the skin-which- was-not-his-own would adapt and adapt. The evolutionary thrust of each part would melt into the other and a single transformation would emerge. When metamorphosis came, if it came, a thinking creature of awesome dimensions would emerge upon the universe—and that universe would worship him.\nNo... Paul was referring to the inner changes, the thoughts and decisions which would inflict themselves upon the worshipers.\n“Those who think you dead,” Leto said, “you know what they say about your last words.”\n“Of course.”\n“Now I do what all life must do in the service of life,” Leto said. “You never said that, but a Priest who thought you\ncould never return and call him liar put those words into your mouth.”\n“l’d not call him liar.” Paul took in a deep breath. “Those are good last words.”\n“Would you stay here or return to that hut in the basin of Shuloch?” Leto asked.\n“This is your universe now,” Paul said.\nThe words filled with defeat cut through Leto. Paul had tried to guide the last strands of a personal vision, a choice he’d made years before in Sietch Tabr. For that, he’d accepted his role as an instrument of revenge for the Cast Out, the remnants of Jacurutu. They had contaminated him, but he’d accepted this rather than his view of this universe which Leto had chosen.\nThe sadness in Leto was so great he could not speak for several minutes. When he could manage his voice, Leto said: “So you baited Alia, tempted her and confused her into inaction and the wrong decisions. And now she knows who you are.”\n“She knows... Yes, she knows.”\nPaul’s voice was old then and filled with hidden protests. There was a reserve of defiance in him, though. He said: “IIl take the vision away from you if | can.”\n“Thousands of peaceful years,” Leto said. “That’s what l'Il give them.”\n“Dormancy! Stagnation!”\n“Of course. And those forms of violence which | permit. It'll be a lesson which humankind will never", " accepted his role as an instrument of revenge for the Cast Out, the remnants of Jacurutu.

And those forms of violence which | permit. It'll be a lesson which humankind will never forget.”\n“I spit on your lesson!” Paul said. “You think I’ve not seen a thing similar to what you choose?”\n“You saw it,” Leto agreed.\n“Is your vision any better than mine?”\n“Not one whit better. Worse, perhaps,” Leto said.\n“Then what can | do but resist you?” Paul demanded.\n“Kill me, perhaps?”\n“I’m not that innocent. | know what you’ve set in motion. | know about the broken qanats and the unrest.”\n“And now Assan Tariq will never return to Shuloch. You must go back with me or not at all because this is my vision now.”\n“I choose not to go back.”\nHow old his voice sounds, Leto thought, and the thought was a wrenching pain. He said: “I’ve the hawk ring of the Atreides concealed in my dishdasha. Do you wish me to return it to you?”\n“If I'd only died,” Paul whispered. “I truly wanted to die when I went into the desert that night, but | knew | could not leave this world. | had to come back and—”\n“Restore the legend,” Leto said. “I know. And the jackals of Jacurutu were waiting for you that night as you knew they would be. They wanted your visions! You knew that.”\n“| refused. | never gave them one vision.”\n“But they contaminated you. They fed you spice essence and plied you with women and dreams. And you did have visions.”\n“Sometimes.” How sly his voice sounded.\n“Will you take back your hawk ring?” Leto asked.\nPaul sat down suddenly on the sand, a dark blotch in the Starlight. “No!”\nSo he knows the futility of that path, Leto thought. This revealed much, but not enough. The contest of the visions had moved from its delicate plane of choices down to a gross discarding of alternates. Paul knew he could not win, but he hoped yet to nullify that single vision to which Leto clung.\nPresently Paul said: “Yes, | was contaminated by the Jacurutu. But you contaminate yourself.”\n“That’s true,” Leto admitted. “I am your son.”\n“And are you a good Fremen?”\n“Yes.”\n“Will you permit a blind man to go into the desert finally? Will you let me find peace on my own terms?” He pounded the sand beside him.\n“No, l'Il not permit that,” Leto said. “But it’s your right to fall upon your knife if you insist upon it.”\n“And you would have my body!”\n“True.”\n“No!”\nAnd so he knows that path, Leto thought. The enshrining of Muad’Dib’s body by his son could be contrived as a form of cement for Leto’s vision.\n“You never told them, did you, father?” Leto asked.\n“I never told them.”\n“But | told them,” Leto said. “I told Muriz. Kralizec, the Typhoon Struggle.”\nPaul’s shoulders sagged. “You cannot,” he whispered. “You cannot.”\n“lam a creature of this desert now, father,” Leto said. “Would you speak thus to a Coriolis storm?”\n“You think me coward for refusing that path,” Paul said, his voice husky and trembling. “Oh, | understand you well, son. Augury and haruspication have always been their own torments. But | was never lost in the possible futures because this one is unspeakable!”\n“Your Jihad will be a summer picnic on Caladan by comparison,” Leto agreed. “l'Il take you to Gurney Halleck now.”\n“Gurney! He serves the Sisterhood through my mother.”\nAnd now Leto understood the extent of his father’s vision. “No, father. Gurney no longer serves anyone. | Know the place to find him and | can take you there. It’s time for the new legend to be created.”\n“I see that | cannot sway you. Let me touch you, then, for you are my son.”\nLeto held out his right hand to meet the groping fingers, felt their strength, matched it, and resisted every shift of\nPaul’s arm. “Not even a poisoned knife will harm me now,” Leto said. “I’m already a different chemistry.”\nTears slipped from the sightless eyes and Paul released his grip, dropped his hand to his side. “If l’d chosen your way, I'd have become the bicouros of shaitan. What will you become?”\n“For a time they'll call me the missionary of sha/tan, too,” Leto said. “Then they'll begin to wonder and, finally, they'll understand. You didn’t take your vision far enough, father. Your hands did good things and evil.”\n“But the evil was known after the event!”\n“Which is the way of many great evils,” Leto said. “You crossed over only into a part of my vision. Was your strength not enough?”\n“You know | couldn’t stay there. | could never do an evil act which was known before the act. I’m not Jacurutu.” He clambered to his feet. “Do you think me one of those who laughs alone at night?”\n“It is sad that you were never really Fremen,” Leto said. “We Fremen know how to commission the arifa. Our judges can choose between evils. It’s always been that way for us.”\n“Fremen, is it? Slaves of the fate you helped to make?” Paul stepped toward Leto, reached out in an oddly shy movement, touched Leto’s sheathed arm, explored up it to where the membrane exposed an ear, then the cheek and, finally, the mouth. “Ahhhh, that is your own flesh yet,” he said. “Where will that flesh take you?” He dropped his hand.\n“Into a place where humans may create their futures from instant to instant.”\n“So you say. An Abomination might say the same.”\n“I’m not Abomination, though | might’ve been,” Leto said. “I saw how it goes with Alia. A demon lives in her, father. Ghani and | know that demon: it’s the Baron, your grandfather.”\nPaul buried his face in his hands. His shoulders shook for a moment, then he lowered his hands and his mouth was\nset in a harsh line. “There is a curse upon our House. | prayed that you would throw that ring into the sand, that you’d deny me and run away to make... another life. It was there for you.”\n“At what price?”\nAfter a long silence, Paul said: “The end adjusts the path behind it. Just once | failed to fight for my principles. Just once. | accepted the Mahdinate. | did it for Chani, but it made me a bad leader.”\nLeto found he couldn’t answer this. The memory of that decision was there within him.\n“| cannot lie to you any more than | could lie to myself,” Paul said. “I know this. Every man should have such an auditor. | will only ask this one thing: is the Typhoon Struggle necessary?”\n“It’s that or humans will be extinguished.”\nPaul heard the truth in Leto’s words, spoke in a low voice which acknowledged the greater breadth of his son’s vision. “I did not see that among the choices.”\n“I believe the Sisterhood suspects it,” Leto said. “I cannot accept any other explanation of my grandmother’s decision.”\nThe night wind blew coldly around them then. It whipped Paul’s robe around his legs. He trembled. Seeing this, Leto said: “You’ve a kit, father. l'Il inflate the tent and we can spend this night in comfort.”\nBut Paul could only shake his head, knowing he would have no comfort from this night or any other. Muad’Dib, The Hero, must be destroyed. He’d said it himself. Only The Preacher could go on now.\nFremen were the first humans to develop a conscious/unconscious symbology through which to experience the movements and relationships of their planetary system. They were the first people anywhere to express climate in terms of a semi-mathematic language whose written symbols embody (and internalize) the external relationships. The language itself was part of the system it described. Its written form carried the shape of what it described. The intimate local knowledge of what was available to support life was implicit in this development. One can measure the extent of this language/system interaction by the fact that Fremen accepted themselves as foraging and browsing animals.\n—THE STORY OF LIET-KYNES BY HARQ AL-ADA\ndd Kaveh wahid,” Stilgar said. Bring coffee. He signaled\nwith a raised hand to an aide who stood at one side near the single door to the austere rock-walled room where he had spent this wakeful night. This was the place where the old Fremen Naib usually took his spartan breakfast, and it was almost breakfast time, but after such a night he did not feel hungry. He stood, stretching his muscles.\nDuncan Idaho sat on a low cushion near the door, trying to suppress a yawn. He had just realized that, while they talked, he and Stilgar had gone through an entire night.\n“Forgive me, Stil,” he said. “I’ve kept you up all night.”\n“To stay awake all night adds a day to your life,” Stilgar said, accepting the tray with coffee as it was passed in the door. He pushed a low bench in front of Idaho, placed the tray on it and sat across from his guest.\nBoth men wore the yellow robes of mourning, but Idaho’s was a borrowed garment worn because the people of Tabr had resented the Atreides green of his working uniform.\nStilgar poured the dark brew from the fat copper carafe, sipped first, and lifted his cup as a signal to Idaho—the\nancient Fremen custom: “It is safe; I have taken some of it.”\nThe coffee was Harah’s work, done just as Stilgar preferred it: the beans roasted to a rose-brown, ground to a fine powder in a stone mortar while still hot, and boiled immediately; a pinch of melange added.\nIdaho inhaled the spice-rich aroma, sipped carefully but noisily. He still did not know if he had convinced Stilgar. His mentat faculties had begun to work sluggishly in the early hours of the morning, all of his computations confronted at last by the inescapable datum supplied in the message from Gurney Halleck.\nAlia had known about Leto! She’d known.\nAnd Javid had to be a part of that knowing.\n“I must be freed of your restraints,” Idaho said at last, taking up the arguments once more.\nStilgar stood his", " cup as a signal to Idaho—the\nancient Fremen custom: “It is safe; I have taken some of it.”\nThe coffee was Harah’s work, done just as Stilgar preferred it: the beans roasted to a rose-brown, ground to a fine powder in a stone mortar while still hot, and boiled immediately; a pinch of melange added.\nIdaho inhaled the spice-rich aroma, sipped carefully but noisily.

She’d known.\nAnd Javid had to be a part of that knowing.\n“I must be freed of your restraints,” Idaho said at last, taking up the arguments once more.\nStilgar stood his ground. “The agreement of neutrality requires me to make hard judgments. Ghani is safe here. You and Irulan are safe here. But you may not send messages. Receive messages, yes, but you may not send them. I’ve given my word.”\n“This is not the treatment usually accorded a guest and an old friend who has shared your dangers,” Idaho said, knowing he’d used this argument before.\nStilgar put down his cup, setting it carefully into its place on the tray and keeping his attention on it as he spoke. “We Fremen don’t feel guilt for the same things that arouse such feelings in others,” he said. He raised his attention to Idaho’s face.\nHe must be made to take Ghani and flee this place, |\\daho thought. He said: “It was not my intention to raise a storm of guilt.”\n“I understand that,” Stilgar said. “I raise the question to impress upon you our Fremen attitude, because that is what we are dealing with: Fremen. Even Alia thinks Fremen.”\n“And the Priests?”\n“They are another matter,” Stilgar said. “They want the people to swallow the grey wind of sin, taking that into the everlasting. This is a great blotch by which they seek to know their own piety.” He spoke in a level voice, but Idaho heard the bitterness and wondered why that bitterness could not sway Stilgar.\n“It’s an old, old trick of autocratic rule,” Idaho said. “Alia knows it well. Good subjects must feel guilty. The guilt begins as a feeling of failure. The good autocrat provides many opportunities for failure in the populace.”\n“I’ve noticed.” Stilgar spoke dryly. “But you must forgive me if | mention to you once more that this is your wife of whom you speak. It is the sister of Muad’Dib.”\n“She’s possessed, | tell you!”\n“Many say it. She will have to undergo the test one day. Meanwhile there are other considerations more important.”\nIdaho shook his head sadly. “Everything I’ve told you can be verified. The communication with Jacurutu was always through Alia’s Temple. The plot against the twins had accomplices there. Money for the sale of worms off-planet goes there. All of the strings lead to Alia’s office, to the Regency.”\nStilgar shook his head, drew in a deep breath. “This is neutral territory. I’ve given my word.”\n“Things can’t go on this way!” Idaho protested.\n“| agree.” Stilgar nodded. “Alia’s caught inside the circle and every day the circle grows smaller. It’s like our old custom of having many wives. This pinpoints male sterility.” He bent a questioning gaze on Idaho. “You say she deceived you with other men—‘using her sex aS a weapon’ is the way | believe you’ve expressed it. Then you have a perfectly legal avenue available to you. Javid’s here in Tabr with messages from Alia. You have only to—”\n“On your neutral territory?”\n“No, but outside in the desert... .”\n“And if | took that opportunity to escape?”\n“You'll not be given such an opportunity.”\n“Still, | swear to you, Alia’s possessed. What do | have to do to convince you of—”\n“A difficult thing to prove,” Stilgar said. It was the argument he’d used many times during the night.\nIdaho recalled Jessica’s words, said: “But you’ve ways of proving it.”\n“A way, yes,” Stilgar said. Again he shook his head. “Painful, irrevocable. That is why | remind you about our attitude toward guilt. We can free ourselves from guilts which might destroy us in everything except the Trial of Possession. For that, the tribunal, which is all of the people, accepts complete responsibility.”\n“You've done it before, haven’t you?”\n“I’m sure the Reverend Mother didn’t omit our history in her recital,” Stilgar said. “You well know we've done it before.”\nIdaho responded to the irritation in Stilgar’s voice. “I wasn’t trying to trap you in a falsehood. It’s just—”\n“It’s the long night and the questions without answers,” Stilgar said. “And now it’s morning.”\n“I must be allowed to send a message to Jessica,” Idaho said.\n“That would be a message to Salusa,” Stilgar said. “| don’t make evening promises. My word is meant to be kept; that is why Tabr’s neutral territory. | will hold you in silence. | have pledged this for my entire household.”\n“Alia must be brought to your Trial!”\n“Perhaps. First, we must find out if there are extenuating circumstances. A failure of authority, possibly. Or even bad luck. It could be a case of that natural bad tendency which all humans share, and not possession at all.”\n“You want to be sure I’m not just the husband wronged, seeking others to execute his revenge,” Idaho said.\n“The thought has occurred to others, not to me,” Stilgar said. He smiled to take the sting out of his words. “We\nFremen have our science of tradition, our hadith. When we fear a mentat or a Reverend Mother, we revert to the hadith. It is said that the only fear we cannot correct is the fear of our own mistakes.”\n“The Lady Jessica must be told,” Idaho said. “Gurney says\n“That message may not come from Gurney Halleck.”\n“It comes from no other. We Atreides have our ways of verifying messages. Stil, won’t you at least explore some of\n“Jacurutu is no more,” Stilgar said. “It was destroyed many generations ago.” He touched Idaho’s sleeve. “In any event, | cannot spare the fighting men. These are troubled times, the threat to the qanat... you understand?” He sat back. “Now, when Alia—”\n“There is no more Alia,” Idaho said.\n“So you say.” Stilgar took another sip of coffee, replaced the cup. “Let it rest there, friend Idaho. Often there’s no need to tear off an arm to remove a splinter.”\n“Then let’s talk about Ghanima.”\n“There’s no need. She has my countenance, my bond. No one can harm her here.”\nHe cannot be that naive, Idaho thought.\nBut Stilgar was rising to indicate that the interview was ended.\nIdaho levered himself to his feet, feeling the stiffness in his knees. His calves felt numb. As Idaho stood, an aide entered and stood aside. Javid came into the room behind him. Idaho turned. Stilgar stood four paces away. Without hesitating, Idaho drew his knife in one swift motion and drove its point into the breast of the unsuspecting Javid. The man staggered backward, pulling himself off the knife. He turned, fell onto his face. His legs kicked and he was dead.\n“That was to silence the gossip,” Idaho said.\nThe aide stood with drawn knife, undecided how to react. Idaho had already sheathed his own knife, leaving a trace of\nblood on the edge of his yellow robe.\n“You have defiled my honor!” Stilgar cried. “This is neutral—”\n“Shut up!” Idaho glared at the shocked Naib. “You wear a collar, Stilgar!”\nIt was one of the three most deadly insults which could be directed at a Fremen. Stilgar’s face went pale.\n“You are a servant,” Idaho said. “You’ve sold Fremen for their water.”\nThis was the second most deadly insult, the one which had destroyed the original Jacurutu.\nStilgar ground his teeth, put a hand on his crysknife. The aide stepped back away from the body in the doorway.\nTurning his back on the Naib, Idaho stepped into the door, taking the narrow opening beside Javid’s body and speaking without turning, delivered the third insult. “You have no immortality, Stilgar. None of your descendants carry your blood!”\n“Where do you go now, mentat?” Stilgar called as Idaho continued leaving the room. Stilgar’s voice was as cold asa wind from the poles.\n“To find Jacurutu,” Idaho said, still not turning.\nStilgar drew his knife. “Perhaps | can help you.”\nIdaho was at the outer lip of the passage now. Without stopping, he said: “If you’d help me with your knife, water- thief, please do it in my back. That’s the fitting way for one who wears the collar of a demon.”\nWith two leaping strides Stilgar crossed the room, stepped on Javid’s body and caught Idaho in the outer passage. One gnarled hand jerked Idaho around and to a stop. Stilgar confronted Idaho with bared teeth and a drawn knife. Such was his rage that Stilgar did not even see the curious smile on Idaho's face.\n“Draw your knife, mentat scum!” Stilgar roared.\nIdaho laughed. He cuffed Stilgar sharply—left hand, right hand—two stinging slaps to the head.\nWith an incoherent screech, Stilgar drove his knife into Idaho’s abdomen, striking upward through the diaphragm into the heart.\nIdaho sagged onto the blade, grinned up at Stilgar, whose rage dissolved into sudden icy shock.\n“Two deaths for the Atreides,” Idaho husked. “The second for no better reason than the first.” He lurched sideways, collapsed to the stone floor on his face. Blood spread out from his wound.\nStilgar stared down past his dripping knife at the body of Idaho, took a deep, trembling breath. Javid lay dead behind him. And the consort of Alia, the Womb of Heaven, lay dead at Stilgar’s own hands. It might be argued that a Naib had but protected the honor of his name, avenging the threat to his promised neutrality. But this dead man was Duncan Idaho. No matter the arguments available, no matter the “extenuating circumstances,” nothing could erase such an act. Even were Alia to approve privately, she would be forced to respond publicly in revenge. She was, after all, Fremen. To rule Fremen, she could be nothing else, not even to the smallest degree.\nOnly then did it occur to Stilgar that this situation was precisely what Idaho had intended to buy with his “second death.”\nStilgar looked up, saw the shocked face of Harah, his second wife, peering at him in an enclosing throng. Everywhere Stilgar turned there were faces with identical expressions: shock and an understanding of the consequences.\nSlowly Stilgar drew himself erect, wiped the blade on his sleeve and sheathed"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_e772dee294aa10695bed6e07646cab36f70474041c88829a379dde41af79172b_v2"}
