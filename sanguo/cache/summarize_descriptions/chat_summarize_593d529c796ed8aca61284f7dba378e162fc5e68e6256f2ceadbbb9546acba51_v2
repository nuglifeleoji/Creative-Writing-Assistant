He is depicted as a figure who has usurped power in the region, engaging in various political maneuvers that reflect his ambitions and the turbulent nature of the times. His actions are marked by a sense of hesitation, particularly when it comes to opening the gates of 襄阳 to 玄德, a decision that carries substantial implications for the power dynamics in the area.\n\nAdditionally, 刘琮 is identified as another son of 刘备, which adds a layer of familial complexity to his character. His presence during the meeting to welcome 玄德 indicates his involvement in the broader political and familial alliances that are crucial to the narrative. This duality of being both a son of a prominent leader and a power player in his own right illustrates the intricate relationships and conflicts that define the story.\n\nOverall, 刘琮 embodies the themes of ambition, hesitation, and the struggle for power within the context of his familial ties and the political landscape of Jingzhou.
