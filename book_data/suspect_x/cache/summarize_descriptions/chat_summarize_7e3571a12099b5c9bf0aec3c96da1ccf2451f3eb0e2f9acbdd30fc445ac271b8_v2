Primarily tasked with defending the Tleilaxu from external threats, they also function as frontier enforcers, regulating interactions with outsiders and maintaining internal order. Their duties include policing the **selamliks**—restricted areas of Tleilaxu society—and ensuring strict adherence to the Bene Tleilax's rigid societal rules.  \n\nOperating as both a defensive military unit and a frontier police force, the Khasadars play a dual role: protecting the Tleilaxu from external incursions while rigorously controlling access to their secluded domains. Their presence reinforces the insular and secretive nature of the Bene Tleilax, preventing unauthorized contact with outsiders and upholding the faction's stringent cultural and legal codes.  \n\nThough described with slight variations—either as a broader defensive force or a more localized police unit—their core function remains consistent: safeguarding the Tleilaxu's interests through a combination of military vigilance and authoritarian oversight. Their authority extends across both external borders and internal sanctums, making them indispensable to the Bene Tleilax's security and societal structure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251844, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 480, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 159}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
