她的门。她一把将碗撂在炉灶上，也不管闪手撒了一炉灶菜，就跑过去开门。还没等她把门打开，她妹妹晓霞就咯咯地笑着闯进来了。润叶心一凉，说：“死女子！象个土匪！” \n　　晓霞毛衣外面披个衫子，风风火火地走进来，看了看撒了一炉台的土豆块，说：“啊呀，姐，你是不是对我们有意见了，不回家吃饭，在这里赌气吃这种烂菜？” \n　　润叶拿过扫帚，把倒在炉台上的土豆块扫在铁簸箕里，说：“这几天学校事多，我不得回去。家里没什么事吧？”“你不记得了？今天是我外爷的生日，六十五大寿，不摆一桌还行？我妈让我来叫你快回去吃饭。幸亏我赶来了，要不你把这碗土豆块早吃光了。快走吧！”晓霞催她说。 \n　　润叶想：徐大爷过生日，是个吉庆事，她不回去对老人不尊重。 \n　　她只好把自己的门一锁，跟晓霞回她二妈家去了。 \n                  第13章\n　　田福军和他爱人徐爱云正在厨房里忙着炒菜。因为老丈人过生日，福军今天破例亲自下厨房执起了炒瓢。 \n　　徐国强老汉就爱云一个女儿，以前福军和爱云又一直在外地工作，这几年回到本县，他们要弥补以前的不足，因此对老人格外体贴。老汉前几年刚退休，接着老伴也病故了，女儿女婿就劝老人搬到了他们家。 \n　　老岳父是个老粗干部，识字不多，一旦不工作，闲得很寂寞。他不读书，也不看报，整天没事，就在院子的那个花坛里修修整整。也不正经务什么花，种一点牵牛花和能染指甲的那种小红花。花坛里大部分种的是庄稼。地块虽小，样数倒不少。几棵玉米，几棵红薯和土豆，还栽几棵辣椒和茄子。玉米旁边带着豆角，花坛转边还种了一圈南瓜。一年四季，这花坛里倒也另有一番情趣。夏秋之间，南瓜蔓子扯得满院子都是，绊得人都走不利索，田福军有时下班回来，看见这番景象，都忍不住想笑。 \n　　老丈人每年的生日，在田福军家里就是一件大事。老人年纪大了，又很孤单，一家人借此专为他热闹一番，老汉心里也高兴。田福军常忙得顾不上吃饭，更不用说做饭了，平时不是他爱人做，就是他侄女润叶做。但老丈人过生日的菜，他年年都要亲自上手。他过去学着做过几样菜，还比较拿手，另一方面，也表示了他对丈人生日的重视。
