\n　　田福军带着某种安慰的口吻说：“黑老，有一点是肯定的，以后的人们绝对不会怀疑你当年的讴歌完全出于真诚。至于你当时的认识判断，那不可能超越时代的局限性。这种现象古今中外的大作家也不乏其例。我好象记得列宁在评价列夫·托尔斯泰时，也指出了他在这方面的局限性。但列宁并没有因此而否定托尔斯泰，反而称赞他的作品是俄国革命的一面镜子。我是外行，胡说八道！不过，你的《太阳正当头》的确细致地描写了当时农村的社会生活，这一点就足以使以后的读者仍然要读这本书。我认为，不能因作家对当时的生活做出不准确的认识和结论，就连他所描写的生活本身也丧失了价值。这方面最典型的例子就是托尔斯泰……” \n　　田福军的“文艺理论”尽管过于牵强，却一下把黑老说高兴了。他竟然竖起一只拇指，对田福军说：“啊呀，谁说你是个外行？你比内行还内行！你要是搞文学艺术，一定能成大事业！” \n　　田福军仰头大笑了，说：“我根本吃不了那碗饭！”他看黑老情绪高涨起来，乘机转了话题，说：“你到黄原来，一定要对咱们地区的文化事业给予指导！”他指了指旁边的杜正贤和贾冰，“他两个负责这方面的事，有什么你就对他们说！你也知道，咱们山区文化落后，人才留不住……”杜正贤赶忙插话说：“我们已经安排黑老为全区文化艺术界做一次报告！” \n　　黑白同志也就不客气地指导起黄原的文化工作来了。他建议田福军办个戏剧学校；搞个诗社；等条件成熟后，还应该成立文联；并把《黄原文艺》从文化馆分出来归文联领导，他回去找省委宣传部长，争取让这刊物公开向全国发行……田福军一一点头赞许，指示杜正贤和贾冰认真研究黑老的建议；说过一段时间，他要专门召集个会议，解决文化艺术部门的问题。 \n　　本来田福军准备以地委的名义中午在黄原宾馆宴请黑老，但诗人贾冰已经专门买了一只羊，要在家里款待黑老，请他吃羊肉荞面圪凸。地委的宴会只好推到黑老离开时举行。 \n　　众人和田福军在办公室告辞后，贾冰硬拉福军的侄女润叶也到他家里去陪黑老吃饭。和贾冰一个单位的杜丽丽已经和她的男朋友武惠良在贾冰家帮他老婆准备这顿饭了，因此他想让润叶也去凑个热闹。田福军鼓动让侄女去，润叶就答应下来。杜正贤因为女儿和女婿都已经在贾冰家，因此\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
