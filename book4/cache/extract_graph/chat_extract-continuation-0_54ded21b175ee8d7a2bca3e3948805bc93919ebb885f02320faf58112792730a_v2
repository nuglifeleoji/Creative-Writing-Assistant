\n　　尽管这是复习过去的功课，但和从头学没什么区别。我们知道，他们上学的时候，基本没有学什么文化，大部分时间都搞了“革命”。 \n　　整整一代人知识素质的低落，也许是文化革命最为严重的后果。教育的断层造成当今国家中生代人才的断层。其消极痕迹，到处斑驳可见。而迅猛发展的生活进程又对人的知识提出了严厉的要求。被贻误了的一代只能痛苦地在以下二者中选择：要么被生活淘汰；要么走“在职进修”的道路。好在国家也认识到了问题的严重性，到处在开办”电大”、“业大”和“自修大学”，为这些人创造学习条件。 \n　　少平上井后，尽量抓紧时间演习功课。这是一件相当沉重吃力的事，甚至比挖煤都要艰难。不过，这种艰难带给人的是心灵的充实。人处在这种默默奋斗的状态，精神就会从琐碎生活中得到升华。 \n　　正当孙少平沉缅于各种公式、定理和化学分子的时候，晓霞的一封信却把这一切打断了。 \n　　这封信看起来和往常的信没有什么不同，信中除过海阔天空，谈东论西，也同往日一样表达了她对他的炽热感情和无尽的思念。只是在信的后面，她隐约地提到和她一块工作的一个男人似乎在追求她。而最使他震惊的是，她竟然没有“攻击”这个人。她并且坦率地告诉他，这个人的名字叫高朗，也是原西籍人，还是什么中央某个“老”的后人等等……一刹那间，少平感到就象一块矸石砸在了他的脑袋上，眼里火星乱飞！ \n　　他随手把信扔进箱子，一个人脚步趔趄地走出宿舍。 \n　　他糊里糊涂穿过矿区，而又不知道他该去哪里，眼前一切都是朦胧迷茫的；矿区各种建筑物象顽皮的儿童胡乱堆垒的积木。高耸的井架倾斜了；不是天轮在旋转，而是整个天空在旋转。 \n　　“天啊……”他嘴里喃喃地叫道。他自己并不清楚，他正沿着铁道的枕木，一直走出了矿区，已经来到了东头的山野里。 \n　　他呆立在一块收割过小麦的地边上，茫然地望着遥远的山峦和模糊的地平线。他牙齿咬着嘴唇，眼里旋转着泪水，喉咙上堵塞着哽咽。此刻，他又想起了早年间的那个傍晚，他从原西中学的篮球场上走出去，恍惚地立在原西河边的情景。现在，他再一次为了爱情的伤痛，而难过地立在这里。生活使他重新扮演了往日的角色。生活，生活，这就是生活！ \n　　随着一声汽笛的长嚎，一辆自东而西的运煤专列隆隆地驶过旁边的铁道。气�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character who is struggling with his
