This project involves the selection of four individuals, referred to as 面壁者 (Wallfacers), who are tasked with developing complex and secretive plans to protect humanity. The essence of the project lies in the Wallfacers' ability to engage in closed personal thinking, allowing them to devise strategies without the risk of external surveillance, particularly from the advanced Trisolaran intelligence known as 智子.\n\nThe initiative is characterized by its reliance on the inner thoughts and decision-making processes of the selected Wallfacers, who must navigate significant challenges and make sacrifices in their efforts to counter the enemy. The project is not only a military strategy but also a historical reference, as highlighted by 罗辑 (Luo Ji), who discusses its implications and the burdens it places on those involved. The Wallfacer Project is portrayed as a unique mission in history, emphasizing the importance of secrecy and the innovative leadership structure it introduces.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the Wallfacer Project is depicted as a critical meeting point for discussions on defense strategies, including the development and deployment of advanced weaponry such as hydrogen bombs. It serves as a platform for the Wallfacers to share their insights and collaborate on solutions to the Trisolaran crisis. Notably, 罗辑 is identified as a key figure within this initiative, having been designated as the sole Wallfacer at one point, although he later expresses a desire to distance himself from the identity and responsibilities associated with the project.\n\nThe project also highlights the interplay between personal lives and the overarching mission, as seen in the connections between 罗辑 and 庄颜 (Zhuang Yan), which are intricately linked to the challenges posed by the Wallfacer Project. The initiative is framed as a vital effort to safeguard human existence, requiring the Wallfacers to confront not only external threats but also the moral and ethical dilemmas that arise from their roles.\n\nIn summary, the Wallfacer Project is a historic and strategic endeavor aimed at protecting humanity from the Trisolaran invasion, involving a select group of individuals who must engage in secretive and strategic thinking to devise effective countermeasures. The project encapsulates themes of sacrifice, leadership, and the complexities of human decision-making in the face of existential threats.\",24\r\n203,联合国行星防御理事会,\"The United Nations Planetary Defense Council is a crucial entity tasked with overseeing the Wallfacers, a group of individuals designated to develop strategies for planetary defense.
