却说袁绍欲斩玄德。玄德从容进曰：“明公只听一面之词，而绝向日之情耶？备自徐州失散，二弟云长未知存否；天下同貌者不少，岂赤面长须之人，即为关某也？明公何不察之？”袁绍是个没主张的人，闻玄德之言，责沮授曰：“误听汝言，险杀好人。”遂仍请玄德上帐坐，议报颜良之仇。帐下一人应声而进曰：“颜良与我如兄弟，今被曹贼所杀，我安得不雪其恨？”玄德视其人，身长八尺，面如獬豸，乃河北名将文丑也。袁绍大喜曰：“非汝不能报颜良之仇。吾与十万军兵，便渡黄河，追杀曹贼！”沮授曰：“不可。今宜留屯延津，分兵官渡，乃为上策。若轻举渡河，设或有变，众皆不能还矣。”绍怒曰：“皆是汝等迟缓军心，迁延日月，有妨大事！岂不闻兵贵神速乎？”沮授出，叹曰：“上盈其志，下务其功；悠悠黄河，吾其济乎！”遂托疾不出议事。玄德曰：“备蒙大恩，无可报效，意欲与文将军同行：一者报明公之德，二者就探云长的实信。”绍喜，唤文丑与玄德同领前部。文丑曰：“刘玄德屡败之将，于军不利。既主公要他去时，某分三万军，教他为后部。”于是文丑自领七万军先行，令玄德引三万军随后。\n\n    且说曹操见云长斩了颜良，倍加钦敬，表奏朝廷，封云长为汉寿亭侯，铸印送关公。忽报袁绍又使大将文丑渡黄河，已据延津之上。操乃先使人移徙居民于西河，然后自领兵迎之；传下将令：以后军为前军，以前军为后军；粮草先行，军兵在后。吕虔曰：“粮草在先，军兵在后，何意也？”操曰：“粮草在后，多被剽掠，故令在前。”虔曰：“倘遇敌军劫去，如之奈何？”操曰：“且待敌军到时，却又理会。”虚心疑未决。操令粮食辎重沿河堑至延津。操在后军，听得前军发喊，急教人看时，报说：“河北大将文丑兵至，我军皆弃粮草，四散奔走。后军又远，将如之何？”操以鞭指南阜曰：“此可暂避。”人马急奔土阜。操令军士皆解衣卸甲少歇，尽放其马。文丑军掩至。众将曰：“贼至矣！可急收马匹，退回白马！”荀攸急止之曰：“此正可以饵敌，何故反退？”操急以目视荀攸而笑。攸知其意，不复言。文丑军既得粮草车仗，又来抢马。军士不依队伍，自相杂乱。�\n######################\nOutput:",
