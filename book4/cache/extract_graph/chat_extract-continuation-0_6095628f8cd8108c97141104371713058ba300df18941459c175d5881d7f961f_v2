\n　　所有与会的人，都纷纷争抢着说话。几乎所有的人都支持这么做，并且一个个情绪非常激昂。庄稼人都明白，只要这样做，那今年下来，一队家家户户恐怕都要大囤冒尖小囤流了！ \n　　这群泥腿把子穷得都濒临绝境，因此没有那么多患得患失；这么严重的离经叛道行为，甚至连后果也考虑得不多。这样做，个人、集体都增加了粮食，为什么要拒挡他们呢？干！头脑热烘烘的庄稼人，已经沉浸在一片激动之中。他们已经纷纷议论起怎样分组；分组后怎样劳动；有的甚至描画这样一年下来，他们的光景日月将会如何美气……干脆！一不做，二不休，趁热打铁，现在就研究着往开分！ \n　　在众人的闹哄声中，小队会计田平娃已经在炕桌上铺开了几页白纸，准备记录大家的意见。众人立刻你一句我一句地吵开了。 \n　　弄了大半夜，庄稼人还连一点瞌睡也没。这些没文化的农民，竟然搞出了一份叫人大为惊呀的“文件”——田平娃给它起了个正确的名字：合同。 \n　　现将其中的一份抄录于后，无兴趣的读者可以跳过不读，有兴趣的不妨浏览一下——双水村大队第一生产队一九七八年农业作业组生产合同经协商，第一生产队（甲方）与第三农业组（乙方）订签七八年生产合同如下：一、生产任务：定土地２２０亩。夏田１０３亩，其中小麦８３亩，复种荞麦１０亩；秋田１１７亩，其中玉米６０亩、谷子１５亩、糜子２５亩、蔓豆１０亩、其它豆类７亩。二、交队产量：小麦１２９４０斤、玉米１７７００斤、糜子３５５０斤、谷子３３００斤、蔓豆１７００斤、荞麦８００斤、其它豆类１１９０斤。 \n　　三、定工：按照各种作物的工序和组内社员投肥，共定工３１４０个。其中工序工（见附表）２３４０个；组内社员投肥工２８００个。 \n　　四、投资：投化肥２３００斤、农药款１０元。 \n　　五、奖赔：全奖全赔。所定工序如有一道工序未搞，除扣本工序定工外，再扣总定工的１０％。 \n　　六、说明：组内搞副业需经生产队批准。其收入队、组各半；队按１．５０元一个工给组记工。 \n　　队长：孙少安（签名） \n　　第三农业组长：田福林（签名） \n　　第二天上午，孙少安拿着这些“文件”进了田福堂家。他向书记详细汇报了一队今年的这新打算、新办法；并且把开会的情况也给书记说了。 \n　　田福堂听了这事，就象耳朵边响了一声炸雷，都\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
