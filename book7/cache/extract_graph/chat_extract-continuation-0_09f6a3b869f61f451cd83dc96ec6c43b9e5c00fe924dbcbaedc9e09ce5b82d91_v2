石神转着这样的念头一回到公寓，就发现他的房门前站了一个男人，是个身穿黑色薄外套的高个男子。大概是听到石神的脚步声，男人朝\n\n他转过脸。眼镜的镜片冷光一闪。\n    是刑警吗？这是他第一个念头，但他立刻推翻这个想法。男人的鞋子像新的一样，保养的干干净净。\n    正当他怀着戒心走近时，对方开口了，“是石神吧？”\n    那个声音令石神仰望对方的脸，那张脸上浮现笑容，而且是个眼熟的笑容。\n    石神吸了一口大气，瞪大了眼，“你是汤川学？”\n    二十多年前的记忆，清新地缓缓复生。\n\n------------------------------------------------\n第六章\n那天教室还是一样空荡荡，虽然空间足以容纳百人，在座的却顶多只有二十人。而且几乎所有的学生，都坐在后面的位子，以便一点完名就立刻开溜，或是可以在底下做自己\n\n的事。\n    有心专攻数学的学生尤其少得可怜，甚至可说除了石神没有别人。这堂课谈来谈去都是应用物理学的历史背景，所以学生很不捧场。\n    石神遂也对那堂课没什么兴趣，但他还是按照惯例，坐在第一排从左边数第二个位子。无论什么课他都坐在那个位置或附近。之所以不坐正中间，是因为他有意已客观的态度\n\n看待讲课。他知道，即使是再怎么优秀的教授，说出来的话也不见得永远正确。\n    他通常都很孤独，那天却难得地有人坐在后面那个位子，不过他并未太在意这点。在讲师进教室前，他还有事要做。他取出笔记本，开始解答某个题目。\n    “你也是厄多斯的信徒吗？”\n    起先，石神没发觉那个声音是在对自己说话。过了一会儿他之所以抬起脸，是因为他很好奇居然会有人提起厄多斯这个名字，他转头向后看。\n    一个长发披肩，敞着衬衫胸口的男人正托着腮，脖子上还挂着金色项链。他常看到那张脸，之前他就知道对方是打算专攻物理的学生。\n    跟他说话的，不可能是这个人――石神才刚闪过这个念头，长发男子就保持托腮的姿势说道：“纸笔是有局限的，不过尝试本身或许就自有意义吧。”\n    是同一个声音，让石神有点惊讶。\n    “你知道我正在做什么？”\n    “我稍微瞄到一眼，不是故意要偷看的。”长发男子指着石神的桌子。\n    石神的视线回到自己的笔记本。上面虽然写着数式，但才写到一半，只是其中一小部分。只看一眼，就能知道他在做什么题目，表示此人也曾演算过这个题目。\n    “你也做过吗？”石神问。\n    长发男子终于放下托腮的手，浮现苦笑。\n    “我向来主张不做不必要的事。毕竟我将来想专攻物理，只是运用数学家提出的定理\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>石神<|>PERSON<|>石神 is a character who is engaged in mathematical
