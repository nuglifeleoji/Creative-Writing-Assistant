那身衣服套在她粗笨的身体上扣不上扣子，她头发蓬乱，脸黑黑的，显然已被艰难的生活磨去了所有女性的精致，只剩下粗鲁和麻木了；第三个女人身上倒还有些年轻时的影子，但她的一只袖管是空的，走路时荡来荡去。\n     三个老红卫兵走到叶文洁面前，面对着她站成了一排—一当年，她们也是这样面对叶哲泰的——试图再现那早已忘却的尊严，但她们当年那魔鬼般的精神力量显然已荡然无存。瘦小女人的脸上有一种老鼠的表情，粗壮女人的脸上只有麻木，独臂女人的两眼望着天空。\n     “你以为我们不敢来？”粗壮女人挑衅似的问道。\n     “我觉得我们应该见见面，过去的事情总该有个了结的。”叶文洁说。\n     “已经了结了，你应该听说过的。”瘦小女人说，她的声音尖尖的，仿佛时刻都带着一种不知从何而来的惊恐。\n     “我是说从精神上。”\n     “那你是准备听我们仔悔了？”粗壮女人问。\n     “你们不该忏悔吗？”\n     “那谁对我们仟悔呢？”一直沉默的独臂女M。\n     粗壮女人说：“我们四个人中，有三个在清华附中的那张大字报上签过名，从大串联、大检阅到大武斗，从‘一司’、‘二司’、‘三司’到‘联动’、‘西纠’、‘东纠’，再到‘新北大公社’、‘红旗战斗队’和 东方红’，我们经历过红卫兵从生到死的全过程。”\n     独臂女人接着说：“在清华校园的百日大武斗中，我们四个人，两个在‘井冈山’，两个在  ‘四·一四’。我曾经举着手榴弹冲向‘井冈山’的土造坦克，这只手被坦克轮子压碎了，当时血肉和骨头在地上和成了泥——那年我才十五 岁啊。”\n     “后来我们走向广阔天地了！”粗壮女人扬起双手说，“我0］四个，两个去了陕西，两个去  了河南，都是最偏僻最穷的地方。刚去的时候还  意气风发呢，可日子久了，干完一天的农活，累得连衣服都洗不动；躺在漏雨的草屋里，听着远处的狼叫，慢慢从梦里回到现实。我们待在穷乡僻壤里，真是叫天天不语，叫地地不应啊。”\n     独臂女人呆呆地看着地面说：‘有时，在荒山小径上，遇到了昔日的红卫兵战友，或是武斗中的敌人，双方互相看看，一样的衣衫破烂，一样的满身尘上和牛粪，相视无语啊。”\n     “唐红静，”粗壮女人盯着叶文洁说，“就是那个朝你父亲的头抽了最要命一皮带的女孩儿，在黄河中淹死了。洪水把队里的羊冲走几只，队支书就冲知青们喊：革命小将们，考验你们的时候到\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
