一个学期，他一直在努力练习自己第一魂技对于水元素的控制。可不知道为什么，却总是有种瓶颈的感觉。似乎水元素与他自身有些格格不入似的。只能是简单的掌控，但威力真的不算大，比一般的十年魂技还有不如。\n\n    可就是这样的魂技，今天他却赢了叶灵瞳。以至于回到家了，蓝轩宇自己还有些莫名其妙。\n\n    他今天是坐校车回来的，除了最初入学时候有父亲接送之外，学院有专门的校车接送学生。\n\n    考试结束就放学了，他战胜了叶灵瞳，出乎意料的实战考试得了高分。但蓝轩宇其实对自己并不满意，他很不喜欢自己面对叶灵瞳冲过来时那种恐惧感。\n\n    家里的修炼室有十平米大，内部有防护罩，可以进行魂技练习，冥想时也能模拟魂师所需要的相应环境，从而起到辅助作用。\n\n    蓝轩宇一进门就进了修炼室。\n\n    他坐在地上，抬左手释放出自己的银纹蓝银草，清新的草叶芬芳，带着那一颗颗水珠，依旧是那令人舒服的生命气息。\n\n    看着自己手心上的蓝银草，蓝轩宇自言自语的道：“蓝银草啊蓝银草，你到底是怎么控制的水啊！为什么会那么弱呢？可是，为什么你又能让叶灵瞳的魂技失效呢？”\n\n    他用手指捻起一颗水珠送到自己面前。水珠本身是无色的，在蓝银草上的银色花纹映衬之下，才会呈现出淡银色。\n\n    事实上，他一直都没有过南澄说的那种和水元素十分亲近的感觉，从来都没有过。\n\n    “我已经很努力的在练习了啊！可为什么就是效果不好呢？”蓝轩宇皱着眉头，“怎么才算是亲近啊？”\n\n    拉过一片蓝银草的叶子，含在自己口中，叶片清清凉凉的。让他的大脑也随之清醒了几分。吸吮了几滴叶片上的水珠，水珠微甜，倒是挺好喝的。\n\n    都喝了，这算不算亲近？\n\n    没什么反应，也没什么变化。一切都和之前一样。\n\n    “滴滴、滴滴、滴滴！”正在这时，家里的魂导通讯器响了起来。\n\n    蓝轩宇赶忙跑出修炼室接通了通信，“您好。”\n\n    “蓝轩宇，我在你家门外，你开门。”听筒里传来十分熟悉又带着几分愤怒的声音。\n\n    “叶灵瞳？”蓝轩宇有些不确定的说道。\n\n    “快开门！”叶灵瞳的声音明显带着几分愤怒。\n\n    “你干嘛呀？”蓝轩宇疑惑的道，“你怎么知道我家通讯号码的，还有，你怎么知道我家在哪里的？”\n\n    叶灵瞳道：“我让爸爸管老师要的。爸爸带我来的。”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is
