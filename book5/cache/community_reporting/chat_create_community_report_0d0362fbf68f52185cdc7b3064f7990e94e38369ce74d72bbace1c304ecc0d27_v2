This system serves as a crucial technological means through which 叶文洁 seeks to establish contact with extraterrestrial entities, specifically targeting the sun as a point of transmission. This act of sending a signal is pivotal in the storyline, as it represents a significant moment of human endeavor to reach out beyond Earth and engage with the cosmos.\n\nSecondly, \"\"信号\"\" also refers to the messages that are received from the 三体世界 (Trisolaran world) and other celestial bodies. These messages indicate various communication attempts from these distant worlds, suggesting an ongoing dialogue or interaction between humanity and extraterrestrial civilizations. The signals received from the 三体世界 are particularly important, as they reveal the complexities and challenges of interstellar communication, highlighting the potential for both understanding and conflict between different forms of life.\n\nIn summary, \"\"信号\"\" embodies both the proactive efforts of 叶文洁 to communicate with the sun through the 红岸发射系统 and the subsequent reception of messages from the 三体世界 and other celestial entities. This duality of sending and receiving signals underscores the themes of exploration, connection, and the quest for knowledge that permeate the narrative.\",3\r\n1008,几何体,,2\r\n900,宇宙航行,宇宙航行是三体世界的一项技术，涉及到其飞船的速度和航行能力,1\r\n901,大型宇宙飞船,大型宇宙飞船是三体世界的舰队组成部分，具有巨大的质量和缓慢的加速能力,1\r\n972,金属般的三体精神,金属般的三体精神是三体世界的特征，象征着其文明的坚硬和冷酷。,1\r\n1051,三号智子,,1\r\n1049,四号智子,四号智子是三体世界的另一个高能加速器，留在三体世界以接收地球智子发回的信息。,1\r\n1050,虫子科学家,虫子科学家是三体世界的科学家，面临智子制造的巨型神迹的威胁。,1\r\n1053,虫子,虫子是三体世界中对人类的贬称，反映了三体文明对人类的看法,1\r\n725,太阳系,\"The 太阳系, or solar system, is a celestial system that encompasses the Sun and a variety of other celestial bodies, including the planets Jupiter and Earth.
