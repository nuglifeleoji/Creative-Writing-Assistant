Originally wielded by the Fremen in their harsh desert environment, crysknives symbolized their connection to the sandworms and their warrior traditions. Over time, some of these revered weapons have been preserved by the Museum Fremen, who now display them in cases as artifacts of historical and spiritual importance.
