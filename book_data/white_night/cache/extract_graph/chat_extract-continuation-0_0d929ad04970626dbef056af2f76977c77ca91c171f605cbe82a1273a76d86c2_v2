最可怕的是他的精神力，早在一年多前，他的精神力就突破到了五百，顺利进入到灵海境层次。按学校记载，还不到十二岁的他，现在精神力已经超过了八百，这个纪录早就打破了天罗学院的同龄人。\n\n    同样以精神力见长的钱磊，现在精神力也不过刚刚突破六百而已。\n\n    可是，蓝轩宇什么都好，唯独他这魂力却成了大问题。\n\n    三年时间，学员们成长的都很快，整个高能少年班经过了几轮淘汰之后，最终保留下来的学员现在还有二十一位，而且也取消了淘汰制度，不再继续淘汰了。\n\n    而在这二十一人之中，其他二十人早就已经突破了两环，吕千寻现在甚至都已经突破到三环境界了。当之无愧的魂力第一人。\n\n    绝大多数学生的魂力都在二十七级以上，最多再有一年左右，整个高能少年班整体魂力就能都突破到三十级以上。\n\n    可是，蓝轩宇呢？他的魂力是多少？\n\n    十九级！是的，三年了，整整三年的时间了，他都还没突破二十级。\n\n    这在普通初级学院里，也算是个正常的魂力等级，十二岁左右，二十级本来就是个门槛。\n\n    可是，这是高能少年班啊！更重要的是，蓝轩宇这三年多不知道吃了多少珍稀食材。这些珍稀食材可不只是增强身体素质的，对魂力修炼也有着相当的帮助，但进了他的肚子，却宛如泥牛入海一般，无影无踪……\n\n    对于魂师来说，魂力是基础，其他方面再怎么优秀，如果没有魂力的支持也没法变得强大啊！\n\n    就像现在，蓝轩宇对于自身武魂的控制已经到了极为精妙的程度，事实上，连季洪彬都挑不出什么问题了。可是，一对一的情况下，不用他那奇葩的自体武魂融合技，他是绝对打不过吕千寻的。就是因为双方魂力等级差了两个大阶。人家有三个魂技，他只有一个，这怎么打？\n\n    季洪彬也着急啊！眼看着蓝轩宇就要十二岁了，这个年纪尤为重要，如果十二岁之前没有达到二十级，他甚至连去那个地方的资格都没有。\n\n    “季老师，我……”蓝轩宇有些可怜巴巴的看着季洪彬。\n\n    “怎么了？男子汉大丈夫有话就说，你扭扭捏捏的干嘛呢？”季洪彬没好气的道，他绝对是严师，尽管很喜欢蓝轩宇，平时也是非常严肃。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“季老师，我能不能请个假，考试也完了，马上假期了，我想请假一个月，跟爸爸妈妈去旅行。”\n\n    “不……”不准两个字几乎是差一点就从季洪彬口中脱口而出。\n\n
