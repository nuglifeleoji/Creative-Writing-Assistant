��离演唱会开始还有两个小时，场馆外已经是万人空巷。不只是有门票的，还有很多没买到票的歌迷们在观望。这会儿最吃香的就是黄牛党了。只要有渠道能拿到票的人，现在都赚的盆满钵满。\n\n    蓝轩宇一家把车停在较远的停车场，一路走过来，人流实在是太密集了，着实是有些困难。\n\n    “真是麻烦啊！澄澄，下次咱们别看了好不好？”蓝潇有些无奈的看着一望无尽的人群。\n\n    南澄扭头瞪了他一眼，“我就这么点爱好，你还不支持吗？”\n\n    蓝潇摊了摊手，道：“可我连这点爱好都没有。”\n\n    南澄道：“你的爱好应该是我和儿子，有了我们，你还想爱好什么？”\n\n    “……，你赢了！”\n\n    排队绝对是一件痛苦的事情，幸好，主办方在维持秩序方面还是相当有经验的。整个秩序维护过程非常顺利。入场的速度还是相当不错的。\n\n    好不容易轮到蓝轩宇一家了，南澄把票取出来递了过去。\n\n    工作人员接过票看了一眼，有些惊讶的道：“您这票不对啊！”\n\n    南澄一愣，急道：“不对？怎么不对了？分明写着演唱会门票啊！”她心中突然想到一个可能性，这不会是有人故意恶作剧的吧？他们排了好久的队才排到的，这要是恶作剧，可就太可恶了。\n\n    “您这票不是在这边检票的。这是贵宾票有专门通道。不需要排队的。我带您们过去吧。”工作人员恭谨的说道。\n\n    现在乐公子可是炙手可热的大明星，能拿到他演唱会的贵宾票可都不是一般人。\n\n    交代了另一名工作人员继续检票，他赶忙在前引导，带着蓝轩宇一家朝着另一个方向走去。\n\n    南澄有些发懵，贵宾票？贵宾票多少钱来的？不对，好像有钱也买不到吧。居然有人给了贵宾票？这实在是太不可思议了。\n\n    “会不会是天罗学院本院那边给的？为了补偿我们？”蓝潇提出了一个可能性。\n------------\n\n第七十六章 她在哪一世\n\n    南澄眼睛一亮，“还真有可能，估计是看我们也不要钱，所以就想要从其他方面进行一下补偿。老公，我有点后悔了，我们应该要了那笔钱的。儿子现在也没事儿了，你说我们是不是应该向他们索赔一下啊！”\n\n    蓝潇有些无奈的点点头，“等回去再说吧，学院方面应该也会给我们个交代的。毕竟出了这么大的事情。”\n\n    贵宾票果然有一个专门的检票处，门很小也不引人注意。但进门之后，却有红地毯一路向前，直接就进入了场馆之中。\n\n    第二排！\n\n    当蓝轩宇一家找到位置的时候，惊喜的发现，竟是在第二排的。而且，贵宾席的座位要宽敞的多，还有一瓶水和一个纸袋。纸袋里赫然是一个手办，正是乐公子的样子，一身银\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
