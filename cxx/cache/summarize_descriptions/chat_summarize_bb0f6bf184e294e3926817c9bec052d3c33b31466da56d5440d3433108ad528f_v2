It serves as a central hub for a national conference involving over 100 million children, facilitating communication and decision-making across the country. FG is designed as a fifth-generation electronic computer that mimics the human brain's neural structure, developed by thousands of scientists and engineers over nearly a decade.\n\nAs a broadcasting organization, FG communicates important information to the public through nationwide broadcasts, specifically targeting children. It provides news and updates, including external news from other regions, and holds daily public votes to decide television programming in a festive environment. FG also connects children through various communication technologies, allowing them to interact and engage with a large audience.\n\nIn its capacity as a supercomputer, FG plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and stability of the nation, particularly as perceived by the children in the information building. It operates under a complex life-support system, equipped with numerous power sources and a sophisticated cooling system, enabling it to function even in extreme conditions, such as a nuclear attack. FG processes millions of calls and gathers information from various sensors across the country, facilitating discussions and decision-making among citizens regarding national issues.\n\nFG is responsible for compiling and approving the national five-year plan based on children's suggestions for entertainment facilities and implementing educational and labor contributions from citizens. It aims to operate the country according to the majority opinion of its citizens, focusing on creating a fun and engaging society. The organization oversees the well-being and activities of children in a post-apocalyptic setting, providing them with food, shelter, and guidance.\n\nAdditionally, FG manages a large database where children's expressions and reactions are stored, attempting to understand and categorize their experiences. It also provides emergency information reports and operates satellites for monitoring purposes.
