蓝潇微微一笑，“存在即合理。星唐传媒无疑是聪明的，他们越是这样，这位新人就越是引人瞩目，等单曲发行的时候，自然会是让人期待。只要水平不太差，成名应该是没什么问题的。而且，星唐传媒的这个新人，一定是有什么特殊的地方。”\n\n    南澄有些不屑的道：“我就不喜欢这些男明星，都是绣花枕头，一点深度都没有。尤其是那些长得比女人还好看的男明星，更是让人看不出性别都，一点意思都没有。”\n\n    蓝潇笑道：“你就喜欢我这种有深度的，我知道的。”\n\n    南澄白了他一眼，“你的脸皮呢？”\n\n    蓝潇哈哈一笑，“不要了、不要了。有你就足够了。”\n\n    南澄俏脸一红，但眼神之中，明显还是带着几分满意的，轻声道：“当着孩子别瞎说。”\n\n    蓝潇笑道：“爸爸爱妈妈，这是多好的正能量教育啊！怎么就是瞎说了。”\n\n    正在这是，蓝轩宇突然抬手指向屏幕，道：“爸爸、妈妈，你们看。”\n\n    蓝潇和南澄说话的工夫，发布会当然还在继续。\n\n    记者们的好奇心都已经被提升到了极致，已经很多人都在叫着，“北总，让我们看看唐乐先生的真容呗。”\n\n    北天鸿微微一笑，“当然。今天的发布会，就是为了让唐乐第一次和大家见面。唐乐，麻烦你了。”\n\n    “嗯。”那个身体周围围绕着星光的男子缓缓站起身，虽然只是出了一个声音，但全场却出奇的安静了下来。无形之中，似乎在他身上有着一种特殊的气场，就那么自然而然的会产生吸引力。\n\n    北天鸿很满意下面记者们的表现，事实上，他自己当初又何尝不是被震撼了？\n\n    他还清楚地记得，当下面人向他汇报说有一名极为优秀新人的时候，他还是有些不屑的。他见过的大明星太多、太多了。哪一个不是极为优秀？一个新人，用得着他亲自去看？\n\n    幸好，那天他的心情不错，抱着随便看看的心态去了。\n\n    然后，他就震惊了、震撼了。甚至不惜和对方那个明显也是菜鸟的经纪人一起，不惜代价的签下了他。\n\n    相貌上，无可挑剔就算了。最重要的就是他那种特殊的气质，无论在什么地方、什么场合。他只要出现在那里，自然而然就是万众瞩目的焦点。\n\n    用北天鸿自己的话来说，他，是天生的明星。必将成为当代最优秀的存在。\n------------\n\n第二十八章 唐乐和轩宇\n\n    本来唐乐这个名字北天鸿是不太满意的，但自从见过本人之后，他就觉得，名字对于这位来说已经不重要了。只要签下他就好。\n\n    乐灵卿看了一眼北天鸿，北天鸿向她点了下头。\n\n    乐灵卿有些骄傲的按动\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
