The Bashar was present on Gammu at some point before departing into the Scattering, a significant event implying a retreat or strategic withdrawal. The descriptions suggest that the Bashar held a position of authority or influence within Gammu's military structure, though the exact nature of their role remains unspecified. The departure into the Scattering indicates a broader narrative involving movement or exile, possibly due to conflict, political upheaval, or other forces.  \n\nThe two descriptions do not contradict but rather complement each other, with the first establishing the Bashar's military ties to Gammu and the second providing context about their eventual departure.
