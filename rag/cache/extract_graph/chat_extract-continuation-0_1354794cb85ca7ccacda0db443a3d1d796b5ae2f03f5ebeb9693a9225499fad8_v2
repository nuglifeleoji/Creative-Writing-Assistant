Couldn’t they smell the shere on his breath?\nIf they were that unaware, let them use the probe. It would be agony for him but they would get nothing from his mind.\nSomething clicked behind him and he heard motion. Three people came into his field of vision and ranged themselves around the foot of the litter. They stared at him silently. Teg moved his attention across the three. The one on his left wore a dark singlesuit with open lapels. Male. He had the squarish face Teg had seen on some Gammu natives—small, beady eyes that stared straight through Teg. It was the face of an inquisitor, one who would not be moved by your agony. The Harkonnens had imported a lot of those in their day. Single-purpose types who could create pain without the slightest change of expression.\nThe one directly at Teg’s feet wore bulky clothing of black and gray similar to that of the escort but the hood was thrown back to reveal a bland face under closely cropped\ngray hair. The face gave nothing away and the clothing revealed little. No telling if this one was male or female. Teg recorded the face: wide forehead, square chin, large green eyes above a knife-ridged nose; a tiny mouth pursed around a moue of distaste.\nThe third member of this group held Teg’s attention longest: tall, a tailored black singlesuit with a severe black jacket over it. Perfectly fitted. Expensive. No decorations or insignia. Male definitely. The man affected boredom and this gave Teg a tag for him. Narrow, supercilious face, brown eyes, thin-lipped mouth. Bored, bored, bored! All of this in here was an unwarranted demand on his very important time. He had vital business elsewhere and these other two, these underlings, must be made to realize that.\nThat one, Teg thought, /s the official observer.\nThe bored one had been sent by the masters of this place to watch and report what he saw. Where was his datacase? Ahhhh, yes: There it was, propped against a wall behind him. Those cases were like a badge for such functionaries. On his inspection tour, Teg had seen these people walking the streets of Ysai and other Gammu cities. Small, thin cases. The more important the functionary, the smaller the case. This one’s case would barely contain a few dataspools and a tiny comeye. He would never be without an ‘eye to link him with his superiors. Thin case: This was an important functionary.\nTeg found himself wondering what the observer would say if Teg asked: “What will you tell them about my composure?”\nThe answer was already there on that bored face. He would not even answer. He was not here to answer. When this one leaves, Teg thought, he will walk with long strides. His attention will be on distances where only he knows what powers await him. He will slap that case against his leg to remind himself of his importance and to call the attention of these others to his badge of authority.\nThe bulky figure at Teg’s feet spoke, a compelling voice and definitely female in those vibrant tones.\n“See how he holds himself and watches us? Silence will not break him. | told you that before we entered. You are wasting our time and we do not have all that much time for such nonsense.”\nTeg stared at her. Something vaguely familiar in the voice. It had some of that compelling quality found in a Reverend Mother. Was that possible?\nThe heavy-faced Gammu type nodded. “You are right, Materly. But | do not give the orders here.”\nMaterly? Teg wondered. Name or title?\nBoth of them looked at the functionary. That one turned and bent to his datacase. He removed a small comeye from it and stood with the screen concealed from his companions and Teg. The ‘eye came alight with a green glow, which cast a sickly illumination over the observer’s features. His self- important smile vanished. He moved his lips silently, words formed only for someone on that ‘eye to see.\nTeg hid his ability to read lips. Anyone trained by the Bene Gesserit could read lips from almost any angle where they were visible. This man spoke a version of Old Galach.\n“It is the Bashar Teg for sure,” he said. “I have made identification.”\nThe green light danced on the functionary’s face while he stared into the ’eye. Whoever communicated with him was in agitated movement if that light meant anything.\nAgain, the functionary’s lips moved soundlessly: “None of us doubts that he has been conditioned against pain and | can smell shere on him. He will...”\nHe fell silent as the green light once more danced on his face.\n“I do not make excuses.” His lips shaped the Old Galach words with care. “You know we will do our best but | recommend that we pursue with vigor all other means of intercepting the ghola.”\nThe green light winked off.\nThe functionary clipped the ’eye to his waist, turned toward his companions and nodded once.\n“The T-probe,” the woman said.\nThey swung the probe over Teg’s head.\nShe called it a T-probe, Teg thought. He looked up at the hood as they brought it over him. There was no Ixian stamp on the thing.\nTeg experienced an odd sense of déja vu. He had the feeling that his own captivity here had occurred many times before. No single-incident déja vu, it was a deeply familiar recognition: the captive and the interrogators—these three ... the probe. He felt emptied. How could he know this moment? He had never personally employed a probe but he had studied their use thoroughly. The Bene Gesserit often used pain but relied mostly on Truthsayers. Even more than that, the Sisterhood believed that some equipment could put them too much under Ixian influence. It was an admission of weakness, a sign that they could not do without such despicable devices. Teg had even suspected there was something in this attitude of a hangover from the Butlerian Jihad, rebellion against machines that could copy out the essence of a human’s thoughts and memories.\nDéja vu!\nMentat logic demanded of him: How do I know this moment? He knew that he had never before been a captive. It was such a ridiculous switch of roles. The great Bashar Teg a captive? He could almost smile. But that deep sense of familiarity persisted.\nHis captors positioned the hood directly over his head and began releasing the medusa contacts one at a time, fixing them to his scalp. The functionary watched his companions work, producing small signs of impatience on an otherwise emotionless face.\nTeg moved his attention across the three faces. Which one of these would act the part of “friend”? Ahhhh, yes: the\none called Materly. Fascinating. Was it a form of Honored Matre? But neither of the others deferred to her as one would expect from what Teg had heard of those returning Lost Ones.\nThese were people from the Scattering, though— except possibly for the square-faced male in the brown singlesuit. Teg studied the woman with care: the mat of gray hair, the quiet composure in those widely spaced green eyes, the Slightly protruding chin with its sense of solidity and reliability. She had been chosen well for “friend.” Materly’s face was a map of respectability, someone you could trust. Teg saw a withdrawn quality in her, though. She was one who would also observe carefully to catch the moment when she must become involved. Surely, she was Bene Gesserit- trained at the very least.\nOr trained by the Honored Matres.\nThey finished attaching the contacts to his head. The Gammu type swung the probe’s console into position where all three could watch the display. The probe’s screen was concealed from Teg.\nThe woman removed Teg’s gag, confirming his judgment. She would be the source of comfort. He moved his tongue around in his mouth, restoring sensation. His face and chest still felt a bit numb from the stunner that had brought him down. How long ago had that been? But if he was to believe the silent words of the functionary, Duncan had escaped.\nThe Gammu type looked to the observer.\n“You may begin, Yar,” the functionary said.\nYar? Teg wondered. Curious name. Almost had a Tleilaxu sound. But Yar was not a Face Dancer... or a Tleilaxu Master. Too big for one and no stigmata of the other. As one trained by the Sisterhood, Teg felt confident of this.\nYar touched a control on the probe’s console.\nTeg heard himself grunt with pain. Nothing had prepared him for that much pain. They must have turned their devil’s machine to maximum for the first thrust. No question about\nit! They knew he was a Mentat. A Mentat could remove himself from some demands of flesh. But this was excruciating! He could not escape it. Agony shivered through his entire body, threatening to blank out his consciousness. Could shere shield him from this?\nThe pain diminished gradually and went away, leaving only quivering memories.\nAgain!\nHe thought suddenly that the spice agony must be like this for a Reverend Mother. Surely, there could be no greater pain. He fought to remain silent but heard himself grunting, moaning. Every ability he had ever learned, Mentat and Bene Gesserit, was called into play, keeping him from forming words, from begging for surcease, from promising to tell them anything if they would only stop.\nOnce more the agony receded and then surged back.\n“Enough!” That was the woman. Teg groped for her name. Materly?\nYar spoke in a sullen voice: “He’s loaded with shere, enough to last him a year at least.” He gestured at his console. “Blank.”\nTeg breathed in shallow gasps. The agony! It continued to increase despite Materly’s demand.\n“I said enough!” Materly snapped.\nSuch sincerity, Teg thought. He felt the pain recede, withdrawing as though every nerve were being removed from his body, pulled out like threads of the remembered agony.\n“It is wrong what we're doing,” Materly said. “This man is\n”\n“He is like any other man,” Yar said. “Shall | attach the special contact to his penis?”\n“Not while I’m here!” Materly said.\nTeg felt himself almost taken in by her sincerity. The last of the agony threads left his flesh and he lay there with a feeling that he had been suspended off the surface that\nsupported him. The sense of déja vu remained. He was here and not here. He had been here and he had not.\n“They will not like it if we fail,” Yar said. “Are you prepared to face them with another failure?”\nMaterly shook her head sharply. She bent over to bring her face into Teg’s line of vision through the medusa tangle of probe contacts. “Bashar, | am sorry for what we do. Believe me. This is not of my making. Please, | find all of this disgusting. Tell us what we need to know and let me make you comfortable.”\nTeg formed a smile for her. She was good! He shifted his gaze to the watchful functionary. “Tell your masters for me. She is very good at this.”\nBlood darkened the functionary’s face. He scowled. “Give him the maximum, Yar.” His voice was a clipped tenor without any of the deep training apparent in Materly’s voice.\n“Please!” Materly said. She straightened but kept her attention on Teg’s eyes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN PROBE<|>EVENT<|>An interrogation device used to extract information through extreme pain, possibly of Ixian origin\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Bashar Teg, a Mentat and Bene Gesserit-trained captive undergoing interrogation with an Ixian Probe\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MATERLY<|>PERSON<|>A female interrogator with a compelling voice, possibly Bene Gesserit or Honored Matre-trained, acting as the 'friend' in the interrogation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>YAR<|>PERSON<|>A male interrogator with a sullen voice, operating the T-probe and suggesting extreme measures\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet or region where Teg's captors may have origins, referenced by the 'Gammu natives'\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>YSAI<|>GEO<|>A city on Gammu where functionaries with datacases are observed\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A historical group known for importing interrogators, referenced in Teg's thoughts\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful Sisterhood that trained Teg in Mentat and Truthsayer techniques\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A feared group from the Scattering, possibly connected to Materly\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A faction known for Face Dancers and genetic manipulation, referenced in Teg's analysis of Yar\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>IXIAN PROBE<|>Teg is subjected to extreme pain by the Ixian Probe during interrogation<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>MATERLY<|>Materly acts as the 'friend' in the interrogation, attempting to gain Teg's trust<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>YAR<|>Yar operates the T-probe and inflicts pain on Teg<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg was trained by the Bene Gesserit, giving him resistance to interrogation<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MATERLY<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Materly's behavior suggests possible training by the Honored Matres<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>YAR<|>TLEILAXU<|>Yar's name and methods hint at possible Tleilaxu connections<|>4\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GAMMU<|>Teg analyzes his captors, including a Gammu-native interrogator<|>3\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>HARKONNENS<|>Teg recalls the Harkonnens' historical use of interrogators<|>2\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
