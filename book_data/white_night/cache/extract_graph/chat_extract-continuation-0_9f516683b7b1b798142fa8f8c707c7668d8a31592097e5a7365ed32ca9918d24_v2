金银双色光晕就那么轻而易举的钻出了防护罩，又钻入了防护罩，当它涌入小婴儿口鼻的时候，哭声终于停滞下来。\n\n    整个机舱，也终于平静了。小婴儿就在那金银色光晕涌入之后，最后一个沉沉睡去。\n\n    不知道过了多少时间……\n\n    “嗡、嗡、嗡！”低沉的嗡鸣声震荡着机舱内部，令沉睡中的众人渐渐苏醒过来。\n\n    “唔，这一觉睡的好舒服啊！这是开始下降的提示？我们难道快要到了吗？”南澄迷迷糊糊的睁开双眼，有些惊讶的看向机舱前端的提示信号。\n\n    驾驶员已经先一步醒过来，笑道：“是的，马上就要到了。正在下降中。”\n\n    南澄突然觉得好像有什么不一样，下意识的，她向身边不远处的试验台看去。\n\n    那小小的婴儿蜷缩在一起，粉嫩嫩的肌肤仿佛泛着柔和的光晕，他小小的，却又有些孤独的样子。\n\n    南澄下意识的就想到，他的爸爸、妈妈在哪里啊？他们也一定会很想念他吧。\n\n    “咦！”她突然意识到不对是什么了，这小家伙竟是不哭了吗？\n\n    南澄赶忙站起身，来到婴儿身边。他那小胸脯因为呼吸而轻微的欺负着，粉嫩的小脸蛋不时还动动，小脸上甚至还带着几分甜甜的微笑。\n\n

“蛋壳？蛋壳呢？”他猛然回过身，目光盯视向南澄。\n\n    “啊？”南澄愣了一下，同样看向存放蛋壳的地方，是的，鸿飞冥冥。没有留下任何痕迹，蛋壳，消失了。\n\n    “不是我，我没有啊！”南澄赶忙慌张的解释道。\n\n    此时，其他几人也都已经醒了过来，发现蛋壳没有了，赶忙围拢了过来。\n\n
