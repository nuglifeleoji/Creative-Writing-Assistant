The老师 enforces discipline on 金翔 by taking measures such as ending meals early, which directly impacts his experience and enjoyment. This action reflects the老师's authority and the expectations placed upon 金翔 within the educational environment.\n\nFurthermore, the老师 punishes 金翔 for his involvement in a fight, highlighting the disciplinary focus of their relationship. This punishment serves as a corrective measure aimed at guiding 金翔's behavior and ensuring adherence to the rules set within the classroom or school setting. The actions of the老师 indicate a commitment to maintaining order and discipline, which is essential in fostering a conducive learning environment.\n\nOverall, the relationship between 金翔 and his老师 is characterized by a clear emphasis on discipline, with the老师 taking proactive steps to address and correct behaviors that deviate from expected norms.
