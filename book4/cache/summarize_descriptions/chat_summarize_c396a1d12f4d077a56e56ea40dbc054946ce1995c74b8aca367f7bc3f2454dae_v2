These modest buildings primarily house individual vendors who sell food and beverages, contributing to the market's lively atmosphere. The market is not only a place for dining but also a venue for commerce, where local entrepreneurs engage in trade.\n\nAdditionally, 自由市场 is the site where 王银满 and a woman from 南洋 began selling toy watches, highlighting the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives within this marketplace.
