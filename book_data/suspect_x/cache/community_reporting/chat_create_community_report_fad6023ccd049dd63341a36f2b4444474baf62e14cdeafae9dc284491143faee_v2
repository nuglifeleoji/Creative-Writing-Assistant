The house is led by Duke Leto Atreides, with key members including his concubine Jessica, their son Paul (later known as Muad'Dib), and their twins Leto II and Ghanima. The Atreides are renowned for their discipline, resilience, and military prowess, often relying on shields, strategic wit, and a silent battle language. Their emblem, the hawk, and their green banner symbolize their influence and legacy.  \n\nFormerly rulers of Caladan, the Atreides were tasked with governing Arrakis but faced betrayal and annihilation by their rivals, House Harkonnen, with Sardaukar assistance. Despite their near-destruction, Paul emerged as the leader of the Fremen resistance, waging a jihad against the Harkonnens and establishing his rule over Arrakis. The Atreides' genetic lineage is highly valued, particularly by the Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu, due to traits like spice sensitivity and prescient abilities.  \n\nThe house's legacy endures through figures like Leto II, the God Emperor, who manipulates bloodlines and enforces control through military and psychological means. Duncan Idaho, a loyal retainer, harbors conflicted feelings toward the Atreides, having served them as a skilled pilot. The family's artifacts, such as Paul’s crysknife, and their historical ties to Rakis are preserved, reinforcing their enduring influence. Though once scattered or believed destroyed, the Atreides remain central to the Imperium's power struggles, embodying leadership, conflict, and a complex legacy of survival.\",50\n227,LASGUN SHIPMENT,\"A Harkonnen attempt to smuggle lasguns onto Arrakis, intercepted by the Atreides>\",2\n43,GIEDI PRIME,\"**Giedi Prime (Gammu)** is the harsh and industrial homeworld of House Harkonnen, a brutal and oppressive regime led by the Baron. Once a dominant Harkonnen stronghold, the planet was later renamed **Gammu**, though its dark legacy persists. Known for its oil-soaked terrain and archaic customs, Giedi Prime is marked by militarism, slave pits, and historical betrayals—such as Gurney Halleck’s scarring at the hands of Beast Rabban.  \n\nThe planet holds significant cultural and strategic importance. It influenced Harkonnen speech patterns and mannerisms, including those of figures like Sirafa. Duncan Idaho retains fragmented pre-ghola memories of Giedi Prime, though its current landscape no longer matches his recollections. The planet is also tied to Duncan’s past, serving as a backdrop for historical conflicts, including raids by House Atreides and potential Sardaukar targets.  \n\nGiedi Prime harbors remnants of its violent history, including suspected **spice (melange) hoards**—possibly old Harkonnen contraband—which have drawn the attention of the Sisterhood and priestesses. Additionally, the planet is home to **inkvine**, a native plant used as a whip. Once a site of lost investments, Giedi Prime’s economic failures have since been written off.  \n\nIn later years, the planet became a base for the **Cult of Alia**, further entwining its legacy with religious and political intrigue. Despite its rebranding as Gammu, the planet remains synonymous with Harkonnen tyranny, a hellish world of oppression and hidden secrets. Its dual identity—both as a remembered battleground and a contemporary locus of power—cements its role as a pivotal location in the Imperium’s turbulent history.\",17\n266,ATTACK ON HOUSE ATREIDES,\"The Harkonnens, with Sardaukar support, launched a devastating attack on House Atreides on Arrakis, resulting in Duke Leto's death and the scattering of his forces.\"\"\",3\n20,HARKONNENS,\"The **Harkonnens** are a powerful, ruthless, and historically influential noble house, infamous for their brutality, political machinations, and oppressive rule.

The Harkonnens were the former rulers of **Arrakis**, controlling the planet and its invaluable **spice trade** before being replaced by the Atreides. Their rule was characterized by cruelty, particularly toward the **Fremen**, whom they oppressed and exploited, demanding water tributes and engaging in past conflicts with them.  \n\nLed by **Baron Vladimir Harkonnen**, the family orchestrated the betrayal and downfall of **Duke Leto Atreides**, including his torture and death, as well as the near-destruction of his household. They are implicated in **Dr. Yueh's betrayal** and are suspected of planting discord, conducting assassination attempts (including on **Paul Atreides** and his mother, **Jessica**), and stockpiling spice to manipulate **CHOAM** profits. The Harkonnens allied with the **Sardaukar** in their war against the Atreides, further cementing their reputation as treacherous and power-hungry.  \n\nTheir legacy is one of tyranny and violence, deeply hated by figures like **Duncan Idaho**, whose family they tortured and killed. The Fremen also despise them, suspecting them of poisoning **Paul-Muad'Dib**. Known for their **spice hoarding** and oppressive tactics, the Harkonnens remain a benchmark for evil in the universe, their name synonymous with cruelty and political ruthlessness.
