�工的劳动局副局长，神秘地问她，这个孙少平是他们家的什么人？晓霞说是她大爹的儿子——她干脆糊弄着把少平换到了田润生的位置上！ \n　　既然是地委书记大哥的儿子，劳动局长哪敢怠慢！一定是田书记本人不好出现，才让女儿来找他办的。办！ \n　　给地委书记办事心切，劳动局长都没顾上想想田书记的大哥竟然姓孙。 \n　　田晓霞知道，要是父亲知道她背着他搞这些名堂，一定会狠狠收拾她一通！ \n　　事情很快就妥当了，孙少平以“一号种子选手”列在了市劳动局副局长的私人笔记本上——这比写在公文上都可靠！ \n　　孙少平兴奋不已，都没心思继续搞这个夏令营——好在也快结束了。 \n　　晓霞和他一样兴奋。她说铜城市已经到了中部平原的边上，每天有两趟到省城的火车，他们以后见面也容易多了。 \n　　两个同时准备远行的人，沉浸在他们未来生活的美好向往中…… \n　　填完招工表不多几天，孙少平就被通知正式录取了；九月上旬，他们就要离开黄原到煤矿去报到。 \n　　还有近半个月时间——他得准备一下！ \n　　他身上还有近二百元钱。他先给家里奇回去一百元。他自己不准备添置什么。只买一套零碎生活用品就行了——到时拿上工资，再从根本上为自己搞点“建设”！这一天，他在百货门市上买了一把梳子和一支牙膏后，突然在十字街头碰见了过去揽工时结识的“萝卜花”。几个月没见面，“萝卜花”似乎又老了许多，腰弯得象一张弓。两个人用城里人的礼节紧紧握住了手。我们记得，在工艺厂做法时，为了胡永州欺负小翠的事，“萝卜花”说了几句“怪话”，少平就扇了他一记耳光。此刻，那件事已经在他们之间不存在了。揽工汉之间的友谊常常在经受了拳脚的洗礼后，变得更加热烈和深沉。此时相见，少平还亲热地把“萝卜花”引到地委他住的地方，并且买了二斤猪头肉和十几个油饼子，两个人用揽工汉的方式大吃了一顿。 \n　　最后，少平索性把他那卷破烂铺盖也送给了“萝卜花”——可怜的“老萝”就一领老羊皮袄伴随他度夏过冬，连个被褥也没有。当然，晓霞送他的那床被子和那条床单，他不会给他人；他要留下来永远漫暖自己的身体和抚慰自己的心灵。 \n　　送走“萝卜花”后，孙少平就兴奋地跑到东关，向他的好朋友金波报告了他被招工的喜讯。金波立刻炒了三十颗鸡蛋，买回一瓶白酒，两个人一下午喝得面\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a
