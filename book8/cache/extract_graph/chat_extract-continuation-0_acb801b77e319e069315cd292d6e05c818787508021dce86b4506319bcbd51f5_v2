刘锋嘴角抽搐了一下，“我这不是修为不够，攻击力较弱吗？可要论速度，我可是全班第一，实至名归。”\n\n    钱磊道：“我还精神力第一呢！”\n\n    “好了、好了，别吵了。反正大家齐心协力就是了。”蓝轩宇眼看两人有点要急，赶忙做起和事老。\n\n    刘锋从床上跳了下来，“吃饭还有会儿，咱们到训练场练会儿，大家熟悉一下彼此的战斗方式，以后也好配合。”\n\n    “好啊！”蓝轩宇虽然有点饿，但他也挺想看看，自己这两位室友的战斗力究竟达到了怎样的程度，毕竟，之后大家还要一直配合呢。\n\n    但是，等他来到训练场的时候就傻眼了。和他想象中一个开阔的大训练场，或者是一个个擂台的形式完全不一样。这是一个不大的空间，也就比他们上课的教室大一点，然后，让他记忆犹新的模拟舱就整齐的摆放在这里，不多不少，刚好三十台。\n\n    模拟舱……\n\n    这玩意儿实在是给蓝轩宇留下了极为深刻的音响啊！要说没有心理阴影那是不可能的。不过，幸好他年纪小，也没想的太多，所以还算好。\n\n    “在模拟舱训练啊？”蓝轩宇表情有些古怪的向身边的刘锋说道。\n\n    钱磊抢着道：“可不是嘛，在别的学校初级学院可没这待遇，模拟舱都是要中级学院才给用，还要额外支付费用呢。咱们高能少年班就是不一样。模拟舱既安全又方便，多好啊！”\n\n    他和刘锋自然不知道蓝轩宇和模拟舱的故事。\n\n    “你第一次来，要去登记一下，你的模拟舱早就空着呢。走吧。”刘锋说道。\n\n    登记很简单，高能少年班的身份核实后蓝轩宇就拥有了自己的模拟舱，没错，是自己的，专属于他自己。\n\n    训练场每一台模拟舱都专属于一名学员，配有详细的记录仪器来记录学员们使用模拟舱的情况。\n\n    这里随时都有专门老师负责，高能少年班的学员也可以时刻前来使用。这就是特殊待遇了，天罗学院为了培养这批精英学员，付出的不可谓不多。\n\n    初始化，和当初考核时用的模拟舱并没有什么太大区别，和上次的新奇相比，这次蓝轩宇多少有些紧张。\n\n    “连线、连线，轩宇，你收到了吗？”耳边突然传来钱磊的声音。原本一片漆黑的眼前也亮起一道光芒，显示着钱磊接入的信号。蓝轩宇意念一动，连接自然完成。\n\n    下一刻，刘锋也完成了接入，耳边响起提示音，“三人小队连接完毕。准入。”\n\n    光芒一闪，蓝轩宇只觉得身体一轻，人就出现在了一个地方。一切都显得那么真实，可却不\n######################\nOutput:",
