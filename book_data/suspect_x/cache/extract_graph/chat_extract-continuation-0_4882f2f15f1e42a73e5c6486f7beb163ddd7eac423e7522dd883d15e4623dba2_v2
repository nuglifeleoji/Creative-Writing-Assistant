Now, | rushed the\nwarning out to Rabban only because the courier had to leave on that Heighliner. You said there could be no delay. Well and good. But now | will have an explanation.”\nHe babbles too much, Hawat thought. He’s not like Leto who could tell me a thing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand. Nor like the Old Duke who could express an entire sentence in the way he accented a single word. This is a clod! Destroying him will be a service to mankind.\n“You will not leave here until I’ve had a full and complete explanation,” the Baron said.\n“You speak too casually of Salusa Secundus,” Hawat said.\n“It’s a penal colony,” the Baron said. “The worst riff-raff in the galaxy are sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to know?”\n“That conditions on the prison planet are more oppressive than anywhere else,” Hawat said. “You hear that the mortality rate among new prisoners is higher than sixty per cent. You hear that the Emperor practices every form of oppression there. You hear all this and do not ask questions?”\n“The Emperor doesn’t permit the Great Houses to inspect his prison,” the Baron growled. “But he hasn't seen into my dungeons, either.”\n“And curiosity about Salusa Secundus Is...ah....” Hawat put a bony finger to his lips. “...discouraged.”\n“So he’s not proud of some of the things he must do there!”\nHawat allowed the faintest of smiles to touch his dark lips. His eyes glinted in the glowtube light as he\nStared at the Baron. “And you’ve never wondered where the Emperor gets his Sardaukar?”\nThe Baron pursed his fat lips. This gave his features the look of a pouting baby, and his voice carried a tone of petulance as he said: “Why...he recruits...that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists from—”\n“Faaa!” Hawat snapped. “The stories you hear about the exploits of the Sardaukar, they’re not rumors, are they? Those are first-hand accounts from the limited number of survivors who’ve fought against the Sardaukar, eh?”\n“The Sardaukar are excellent fighting men, no doubt of it,” the Baron said. “But I think my own legions—”\n“A pack of holiday excursionists by comparison!” Hawat snarled. “You think | don’t know why the Emperor turned against House Atreides?”\n“This is not a realm open to your speculation,” the Baron warned.\nIs it possible that even he doesn’t know what motivated the Emperor in this? Hawat asked himself.\n“Any area is open to my speculation if it does what you’ve hired me to do,” Hawat said. “I am a Mentat. You do not withhold information or computation lines from a Mentat.”\nFor a long minute, the Baron stared at him, then: “Say what you must say, Mentat.”\n“The Padishah Emperor turned against House Atreides because the Duke’s Warmasters Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho had trained a fighting force —a small fighting force—to within a hair as good as\nthe Sardaukar. Some of them were even better. And the Duke was in a position to enlarge his force, to make it every bit as strong as the Emperor’s.”\nThe Baron weighed this disclosure, then: “What has Arrakis to do with this?”\n“It provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest survival training.”\nThe Baron shook his head. “You cannot mean the Fremen?”\n“I mean the Fremen.”\n“Hah! Then why warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left after the Sardaukar pogrom and Rabban’s oppression.”\nHawat continued to stare at him silently.\n“Not more than a handful!” the Baron repeated. “Rabban killed six thousand of them last year alone!”\nStill, Hawat stared at him.\n“And the year before it was nine thousand,” the Baron said. “And before they left, the Sardaukar must’ve accounted for at least twenty thousand.”\n“What are Rabban’s troop losses for the past two years?” Hawat asked.\nThe Baron rubbed his jowls. “Well, he has been recruiting rather heavily, to be sure. His agents make rather extravagant promises and—”\n“Shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers?” Hawat asked.\n“That would seem a little high,” the Baron said.\n“Quite the contrary,” Hawat said. “I can read between the lines of Rabban’s reports as well as you can. And you certainly must’ve understood my reports from our agents.”\n“Arrakis is a fierce planet,” the Baron said. “Storm losses can—”\n“We both know the figure for storm accretion,” Hawat said.\n“What if he has lost thirty thousand?” the Baron demanded, and blood darkened his face.\n“By your own count,” Hawat said, “he killed fifteen thousand over two years while losing twice that number. You say the Sardaukar accounted for another twenty thousand, possibly a few more. And I’ve seen the transportation manifests for their return from Arrakis. If they killed twenty thousand, they lost almost five for one. Why won't you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they mean?”\nThe Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: “This is your job, Mentat. What do they mean?”\n“| gave you Duncan Idaho’s head count on the sietch he visited,” Hawat said. “It all fits. If they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities, their population would be about five million. My best estimate is that they had at least twice that many communities. You scatter your population on such a planet.”\n“Ten million?”\nThe Baron’s jowls quivered with amazement.\n“At least.”\nThe Baron pursed his fat lips. The beady eyes stared without wavering at Hawat. /s this true Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this be and no one suspect?\n“We haven't even cut heavily into their birth-rate- growth figure,” Hawat said. “We’ve just weeded out\nsome of their less successful specimens, leaving the strong to grow stronger—just like on Salusa Secundus.”\n“Salusa Secundus!” the Baron barked. “What has this to do with the Emperor’s prison planet?”\n“A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most others,” Hawat said. “When you add the very best of military training—”\n“Nonsense! By your argument, / could recruit from among the Fremen after the way they’ve been oppressed by my nephew.”\nHawat spoke in a mild voice: “Don’t you oppress any of your troops?”\n“Well...1...but—”\n“Oppression is a relative thing,” Hawat said. “Your fighting men are much better off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant alternative to being soldiers of the Baron, heh?”\nThe Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities—had Rabban unwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon?\nPresently he said: “How could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits?”\n“I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength,” Hawat said. “I’d remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a training cadre of people who understood their background, preferably people who had preceded them from the same oppressive situation. Then I'd fill them with the mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to produce just such Superior beings as themselves. And all the while, I’d\nshow them what such superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine mansions... whatever they desired.”\nThe Baron began to nod. “The way the Sardaukar live at home.”\n“The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa Secundus is justified because it produced them—the elite. The commonest Sardaukar trooper lives a life, in many respects, as exalted as that of any member of a Great House.”\n“Such an idea!” the Baron whispered.\n“You begin to share my suspicions,” Hawat said.\n“Where did such a thing start?” the Baron asked.\n“Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa Secundus before the Emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there? Even the Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions are not encouraged.”\nThe Baron’s eyes glazed with thought. “Yes, a very carefully kept secret. They’d use every device of—”\n“Besides, what’s there to conceal?” Hawat asked. “That the Padishah Emperor has a prison planet? Everyone knows this. That he has—”\n“Count Fenring!” the Baron blurted.\nHawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. “What of Count Fenring?”\n“At my nephew’s birthday several years ago,” the Baron said. “This Imperial popinjay, Count Fenring, came as official observer and to...ah, conclude a business arrangement between the Emperor and myself.”\n“So?”\n“|,..ah, during one of our conversations, | believe | said something about making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring—”\n“What did you say exactly?” Hawat asked.\n“Exactly? That was quite a while ago and—”\n“My Lord Baron, if you wish to make the best use of my services, you must give me adequate information. Wasn't this conversation recorded?”\nThe Baron’s face darkened with anger. “You're as bad as Piter! | don’t like these—”\n“Piter is no longer with you, my Lord,” Hawat said. “As to that, whatever did happen to Piter?”\n“He became too familiar, too demanding of me,” the Baron said.\n“You assure me you don’t waste a useful man,” Hawat said. “Will you waste me by threats and quibbling? We were discussing what you said to Count Fenring.”\nSlowly, the Baron composed his features. When the time comes, he thought, l'II remember his manner with me. Yes. | will remember.\n“One moment,” the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his great hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood. “I said something like this,” the Baron said. “‘The Emperor knows a certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business.’ | was referring to our work force losses. Then | said something about considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem and | said the Emperor’s prison planet inspired me to emulate him.”\n“Witch blood!” Hawat snapped. “What did Fenring say?”\n“That’s when he began questioning me about you.”\nHawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. “So that’s why they started looking into Arrakis,” he said. “Well, the thing’s done.” He opened his eyes. “They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!”\n“But certainly my innocent suggestion that—”\n“Nothing is innocent in an Emperor’s eyes! What were your instructions to Rabban?”\n“Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.”\nHawat shook his head. “You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill off the natives, wipe them out entirely, or—”\n“Waste an entire work force?”\n“Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a cure\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The Emperor is the ruler of the galaxy, concerned about associations between Arrakis and his prison planet Salusa Secundus, and uses the Sardaukar as his elite forces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>A desert planet known for its harsh conditions and the Fremen population, also a key location in the political and military strategies of the Great Houses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>GEO<|>The Emperor's prison planet with oppressive conditions, used as a secret training ground for the elite Sardaukar forces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBAN<|>PERSON<|>Baron Harkonnen's nephew, responsible for oppressing the Fremen on Arrakis and reporting high Fremen casualties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAWAT<|>PERSON<|>A Mentat serving the Baron, analyzing the situation on Arrakis and the potential of the Fremen as a military force)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON<|>PERSON<|>The Baron Harkonnen, a powerful figure in the galaxy, involved in political and military strategies, including the oppression of Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Duke Leto Atreides, a cousin of the Emperor, known for his leadership and military strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD DUKE<|>PERSON<|>A previous Duke of House Atreides, known for his expressive communication style)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARDauKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Emperor's elite fighting force, trained under oppressive conditions on Salusa Secundus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The native population of Arrakis, known for their resilience and potential as a military force)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Great House opposed by the Emperor, known for training a force rivaling the Sardaukar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE HARKONNEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Baron's Great House, involved in the oppression of Arrakis and political maneuvering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNT FENRING<|>PERSON<|>An Imperial observer who questioned the Baron about Arrakis, potentially spying for the Emperor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>PERSON<|>A Warmaster of House Atreides, involved in training a force to rival the Sardaukar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A Warmaster of House Atreides, involved in training a force to rival the Sardaukar)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPEROR<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>The Emperor uses Salusa Secundus as a prison planet and secret training ground for the Sardaukar<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPEROR<|>SARDauKAR<|>The Emperor commands the Sardaukar, his elite military force<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPEROR<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>The Emperor turned against House Atreides due to their military advancements<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAWAT<|>BARON<|>Hawat serves as a Mentat to the Baron, providing strategic analysis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>RABBAN<|>Rabban is the Baron's nephew, tasked with oppressing Arrakis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARON<|>FREMEN<|>The Baron oppresses the Fremen through Rabban's actions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABBAN<|>FREMEN<|>Rabban is responsible for high Fremen casualties on Arrakis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAWAT<|>FREMEN<|>Hawat analyzes the Fremen's potential as a military force<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Fremen are the native population of Arrakis, adapted to its harsh conditions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SARDauKAR<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>The Sardaukar are trained on Salusa Secundus under oppressive conditions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNT FENRING<|>EMPEROR<|>Count Fenring acts as an observer and potential spy for the Emperor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNT FENRING<|>BARON<|>Count Fenring questioned the Baron about Arrakis, possibly spying for the Emperor<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>Gurney Halleck is a Warmaster of House Atreides<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>Duncan Idaho is a Warmaster of House Atreides<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
