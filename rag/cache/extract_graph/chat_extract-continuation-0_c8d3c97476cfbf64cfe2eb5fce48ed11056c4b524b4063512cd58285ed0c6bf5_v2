He settled down right away and was happy. | was....” Harah shrugged.\n“It’s the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?” Jessica asked. “It’s the way she speaks of things\nbeyond her years and of things no child her age could know—things of the past.”\n“How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?” Harah demanded.\n“But he does!” Alia said. “Subiay’s boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting.”\n“Alia!” Jessica said. “I warned you.”\n“But, Mother, | saw it and it was true and....”\nJessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah’s face. What have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth everything that I knew...and more: everything revealed to her out of the corridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.\n“It’s not just the things she says,” Harah said. “It’s the exercises, too: the way she sits and stares ata rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose, or a muscle on the back of a finger, or—”\n“Those are the Bene Gesserit training,” Jessica said. “You know that, Harah. Would you deny my daughter her inheritance?”\n“Reverend Mother, you know these things don’t matter to me,” Harah said. “It’s the people and the way they mutter. | feel danger in it. They say your daughter’s a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that she’s—”\n“She has so little in common with the other children,” Jessica said. “She’s no demon. It’s just the\n“Of course she’s not!”\nJessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah’s tone, glanced down at Alia. The child\nappeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of... waiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.\n“I respect the fact that you’re a member of my son’s household,” Jessica said. (Alia stirred against her hand.) “You may speak openly with me of whatever's troubling you.”\n“I will not be a member of your son’s household much longer,” Harah said. “I’ve waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they receive as the children of Usul. It’s little enough | could give them since it’s known | don’t share your son’s bed.”\nAgain Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.\n“You'd have made a good companion for my son, though,” Jessica said. And she added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion...not a wife. Jessica’s thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came from the common talk in the sietch that her son’s companionship with Chani had become a permanent thing, the marriage.\n| love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have to step aside for royal necessity. Royal marriages had other reasons than love.\n“You think | don’t know what you plan for your son?” Harah asked.\n“What do you mean?” Jessica demanded.\n“You plan to unite the tribes under Him,” Harah Said.\n“Is that bad?”\n“I see danger for him...and Alia is part of that danger.”\nAlia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.\n“I’ve watched you two together,” Harah said, “the way you touch. And Alia is like my own flesh because she’s sister to one who is like my brother. I’ve watched over her and guarded her from the time she was amere baby, from the time of the razzia when we fled here. I’ve seen many things about her.”\nJessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.\n“You know what | mean,” Harah said. “The way she knew from the first what we were saying to her. When has there been another baby who knew the water discipline so young? What other baby’s first words to her nurse were: ‘I love you, Harah’?”\nHarah stared at Alia. “Why do you think | accept her insults? | know there’s no malice in them.”\nAlia looked up at her mother.\n“Yes, | have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother,” Harah said. “I could have been of the Sayyadina. | have seen what I have seen.”\n“Harah....” Jessica shrugged. “I don’t know what to say.” And she felt surprise at herself, because this literally was true.\nAlia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.\n“We made a mistake,” Alia said. “Now we need Harah.”\n“It was the ceremony of the seed,” Harah said, “when you changed the Water of Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.”\nNeed Harah? Jessica asked herself.\n“Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?” Alia asked.\n“What would you have her do?” Jessica asked.\n“She already knows what to do,” Alia said.\n“I will tell them the truth,” Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old and sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp features. “I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that she has never been a little girl.”\nAlia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.\n“I know I’m a freak,” Alia whispered. The adult Summation coming from the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation.\n“You're not a freak!” Harah snapped. “Who dared Say you're a freak?”\nAgain, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah’s voice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly—they did need Harah. The tribe would understand Harah—both her words and her emotions—for it was obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child.\n“Who said it?” Harah repeated.\n“Nobody.”\nAlia used a corner of Jessica’s aba to wipe the tears from her face. She smoothed the robe where She had dampened and crumpled it.\n“Then don’t you Say it,” Harah ordered.\n“Yes, Harah.”\n“Now,” Harah said, “you may tell me what it was like so that | may tell the others. Tell me what it is that happened to you.”\nAlia swallowed, looked up at her mother.\nJessica nodded.\n“One day | woke up,” Alia said. “It was like waking from sleep except that | could not remember going to Sleep. | was in a warm, dark place. And | was frightened.”\nListening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that day in the big cavern.\n“When I was frightened,” Alia said, “I tried to escape, but there was no way to escape. Then | saw a Spark...but it wasn’t exactly like seeing it. The spark was just there with me and | felt the spark’s emotions...soothing me, comforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was my mother.”\nHarah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a look of wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too, were trying to hear Alia’s words.\nAnd Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks...out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?\n“Just when I felt safe and reassured,” Alia said, “there was another spark with us...and everything was happening at once. The other spark was the old Reverend Mother. She was...trading lives with my mother...everything...and | was there with them, seeing it all...everything. And it was over, and | was them and all the others and myself...only it took mea\nlong time to find myself again. There were so many others.”\n“It was a cruel thing,” Jessica said. “No being should wake into consciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to you.”\n“I couldn’t do anything else!” Alia said. “I didn’t know how to reject or hide my consciousness...or Shut it off...everything just happened...everything....”\n“We didn’t know,” Harah murmured. “When we gave your mother the Water to change, we didn’t know you existed within her.”\n“Don’t be sad about it, Harah,” Alia said. “l Shouldn’t feel sorry for myself. After all, there’s cause for happiness here: I’m a Reverend Mother. The tribe has two Rev....”\nShe broke off, tipping her head to listen.\nHarah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia, bringing her attention then up to Jessica’s face.\n“Didn’t you suspect?” Jessica asked.\n“Sh-h-h-h,” Alia said.\nA distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated them from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now: “Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!”\nThe chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to the inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.\nWhen the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the sadness in her voice: “It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse.”\n“My family sat in their pool courtyard,” Harah said, “in air bathed by the moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree of portyguls, round and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket with mish-mish and baklawa and mugs of liban—all manner of good things to eat. In our gardens and in our flocks, there was peace...peace in all the land.”\n“Life was full with happiness until the raiders came,” Alia said.\n“Blood ran cold at the scream of friends,” Jessica said. And she felt the memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.\n“La, la, la, the women cried,” said Harah.\n“The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives dripping red from the lives of our men,” Jessica said.\nSilence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the sietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.\nPresently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.\n“We will never forgive and we will never forget,” Harah said.\nIn the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of people, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber.\n“Reverend Mother?”\nA woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgar’s wives.\n“What is it, Tharthar?”\n“There is trouble, Reverend Mother.”\nJessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. “Paul...” she gasped.\nTharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at Tharthar—a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a young girl with extraordinary knowledge and abilities, having gained consciousness and memories from her mother and other Reverend Mothers while still in the womb.
