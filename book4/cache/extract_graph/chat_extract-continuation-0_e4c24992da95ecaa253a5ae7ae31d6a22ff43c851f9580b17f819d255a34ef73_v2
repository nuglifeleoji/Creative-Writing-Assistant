\n　　这就是他生命的全部意义。这就是他活着的全部价值。 \n　　现在，天已经麻糊糊的了。少平他妈突然惊慌地在锅台边叫道：“哎呀，我的天！我这死人咋忘了喂猪了！” \n　　孙玉厚一听就火了，正要开口数落老婆，就听见女儿兰香在灶火圪崂里说：“妈，猪我已经喂过了……” \n　　窑里所有人的目光，一齐投向这个他们谁也没有留意的十三岁的孩子。她正从筐子里往外倒柴禾。她不知什么时间已经捡回来好几筐柴禾了，足够一两天烧的。可爱的兰香默默地做着她能做的一切活。 \n　　孙玉厚老两口大受感动地看着他们这个最小的孩子，连一句话也说不出来了。按说，她是家里最小的娃娃，应该娇惯一些。可孩子长了这么大，还没给她扯过一件象样的衣服。现在她已经到石圪节上了初中，身上还七长八短地穿着前两年的旧衣服。 \n　　孙玉厚难受地从窑里走出来，站在自家的院子里，不停地挖着旱烟袋。他佝偻着高大的身躯，失神地望着东拉河对面黑乎乎的庙坪山。山依然象他年轻时一样，没高一尺，也没低一尺。可他已经老了，也更无能了…… \n                  第7章\n　　一家人匆匆吃喝了一点饭以后，少平他妈就装起一罐高粱黑豆钱钱稀饭。她心疼女婿，又在饭罐上面的碗里，放了几个早上吃剩的黑面馍和几筷子酸白菜。 \n　　少平即刻提起饭罐，扛着一小捆铺盖卷出了家门，去村中的小学把这些东西送给他那个落难的姐夫。为了好拿，他把一点粮食卷在了铺盖卷里。 \n　　他出了院子，下了一个小坡，来到了公路上。月亮已经从神仙山和庙坪山那边升起来，隐隐约约地照出模糊的村庄和大地。 \n　　少平他们家在最南面的村头，独家独院，和村里其他人家不相连。 \n　　走出一小段路后，就是田家圪崂——一个山窝里，土窑石窑，挨家挨户；高低错落，层层叠叠。双水村田姓人家大都住在这里，因此才叫田家圪崂。他二爸孙玉亭也住在这里，和大队书记田福堂家离得不远。本来，他们当年也住在这里，在他两岁的时候搬了。那是一九六○年，正是困难时期，在山西是太原钢厂当工人的二爸，突然不干了，跑回家让他哥给他娶媳妇。二爸娶过二妈后，住的首先成了问题。老人手里就留下一孔窑洞，爸爸只好�\n######################\nOutput:",
