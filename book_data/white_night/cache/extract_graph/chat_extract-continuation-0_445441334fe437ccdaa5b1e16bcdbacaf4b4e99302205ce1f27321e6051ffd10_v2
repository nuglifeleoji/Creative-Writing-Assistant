“怎么释放啊，爸爸！”蓝轩宇懵懂的问道。\n\n    蓝潇道：“你集中精神，想着之前那曾经出现的草叶，感受着自己身体里是不是有什么奇特的存在。”\n\n    蓝轩宇眨了眨眼睛，默默的去感受着身体的变化，他的精神才刚一集中，身体里似乎就痒了一下，吓得他顿时放松了精神。\n\n    但那痒的感觉突然变成一股温暖的气息流淌全身，痒没有了，取而代之的是一种特别舒服的感觉，下意识的，他抬起了双手。\n\n    淡淡的幽蓝色光晕闪烁，两簇草叶已经从他掌心之中钻出，扶摇直上，一直生长到接近两米长才停顿下来。\n\n    这次蓝潇来得及仔细观察了。蓝色的草叶，带着淡淡的光泽，用手触摸有些柔韧，但确实是和蓝银草没什么区别。就是大，要比一般的蓝银草大得多。\n\n    “确实不太一样。好大啊！”南澄也是做古魂兽研究的，对于蓝银草的知识自然是知道的。\n\n    蓝潇道：“你把魂力测试仪拿过来，给轩宇测试一下。”\n\n    “好。”\n\n    南澄到房间里把魂力测试仪取了过来，对于拥有魂师的家庭来说，这几乎是家庭必备的小型魂导器。\n\n    自从万年前，斗罗大陆乃至于整颗斗罗星进化以来，魂力等级上限就从原本的一百级变成了一百二十级。超过九十九级以上的存在，就被称之为神阶。\n\n    这种家用的魂力测试仪足以测试七十级以下的魂力等级。\n\n    “儿子，你抓住两侧的握柄，然后就像释放武魂那样去调动你身体里那种特殊的存在。”南澄把魂力测试仪递给蓝轩宇。\n\n    魂力测试仪是个球形的，上面有一个圆形屏幕向上，两侧有握柄。这玩意儿甚至不需要再额外使用魂导电池，因为在魂力测试的时候自然会有魂力注入，而这注入的过程，自然就是测试完成的过程了。\n\n    蓝潇握住两侧把手，因为先前痒过之后的舒爽感觉还不错，和先前相比，就少了几分恐惧。\n\n    当那痒的感觉再次出现时，他顿时感觉到，那种令他十分舒爽的特殊能量顺着手臂流淌而出，似乎就是钻进了自己手中的测试仪内。\n\n    蓝潇和南澄都聚精会神的盯视着测试仪。\n\n    测试仪上方屏幕略微闪烁了一下，似乎有些数字要出现，可只是一闪就消失了。\n\n    两人几乎是同时抬头对视一眼，都看出彼此眼中的不可思议。这种情况意味着，没有魂力啊！\n\n
