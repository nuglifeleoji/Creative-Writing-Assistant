��着外部的一台台机器，这是FG的外围设备，它们包括两台高速打印机，一台大型磁带机和三台UPS不间断电源。FG介绍说，除了这些能看到的设备，它还有一个庞大的“生命维持”系统，这系统包括数量众多的电源，复杂的空气调节机构等。这其中最复杂的是一套液氦冷却系统，这个系统保证FG主机的机体内每时每刻都充满流动着的超低温液氦，以保证其超导集成电路的超导性。这套维持系统还包括一组高能同位素电池，可以独立供给FG十五年的电能。所有这一切，都深置于地下200米的坚硬岩层中，整个机室被坚固的防护层包裹着，而防护层同周围岩石又用1500个液压弹簧隔开，以消除可能出现的冲击波。这样，即使地面处于核袭击的爆心，FG仍能正常工作。\n　　“这么说，停电的那一阵子，你一直开着的？”华华问。\n　　“是的，FG的备用电源一直在工作。”\n　　“那当时大厦中为什么是黑的呢？”\n　　“因为FG的备用电源不对大厦供电。但我在大厦中的传感器一直在工作，所以FG能一直看着你们。”\n　　“你……你一直看着我们？！”\n　　“是的，FG在大厦中有1800个视觉传感器，可以看到各个角落。是FG帮助你们播放了灾情报告，但在停电后FG无法帮助你们，因为FG无法给外部执行机构提供电能。”\n　　两个孩子呆呆地听着，200米地下的这一切令他们震惊，这套不寻常的设施无疑耗资巨大，它们都是为FG建起来的，这似乎暗示着这台超级计算机惊人的力量。\n　　“你很能干，是吗？”华华问。\n　　“是的，FG有你们难以想像的强大力量。”\n　　“那你为什么不帮助外面的小朋友呢？”小梦问。\n　　FG没有回答她，只是让他们从主机室出去，乘电梯回大厦顶端的通讯中心大厅。两个孩子也惦记着那些来电话的小朋友，就转身向外走去。主机室的大钢门在他们出去后又隆隆地闭上了。他们脱下了大大的白色工作服和拖鞋，穿上自己的鞋，走进电梯。电梯飞快上升，层数显示板上的数字从-4跳到99，他们又回到了大厦的顶层。\n　　超新星纪元第4小时\n　　大屏幕上那布满红线的全国地图消失了，显示出一行大字：播放系统开始工作……\n　　然后大字也消失了，屏幕上出现了一幅华华和小梦都熟悉的图像，那是他们刚才在FG的地下机室中看到的一切：巨大的“肥皂泡”式透明防护罩，顶部的一束光照着那个神秘的圆柱体，那束光在穿过“肥皂泡”时发生了多彩的折射的散射，如同在圆柱体的上方悬了一片晶莹的亮云。现在，这幅图像和FG的声音，正由各个波段的电波传遍全国，三亿孩子们惊喜地发现白花花的\n######################\nOutput:",
