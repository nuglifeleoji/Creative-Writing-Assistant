\n　　正因为这样，他才舍不得误一天工；他才在沉重的牛马般的劳动中一直保持着巨大的热情。 \n　　瞧，又到发工资的日子了——这是煤矿工人的盛大节日。 \n　　孙少平上完八点班，从井下上到地面，洗了一个舒服的热水澡，就到区队办公室领了工资。 \n　　他揣着一摞硬铮铮的票子，穿过一楼掘进队办公室黑暗的楼道，出了大门。 \n　　五月灿烂的阳光晃得他闭了好一会眼睛。 \n　　从昨夜到现在，他已经十几个小时没见太阳了。阳光对煤矿工人来说，常有一种亲切的陌生感。 \n　　他睁开眼睛，深深地吸了一口气。他真想把那新鲜的空气连同金黄的阳光一起吸进他灌满煤尘的肺腑中！ \n　　他看见，远山已经是一片翠绿了。对面的崖畔上，开满了五彩斑斓的野花。这是一个美妙的季节——春天将尽，炎热的盛夏还没有到来。 \n　　少平把两根纸烟接在一起，贪婪地吸着，走回了他的宿舍。

\n　　少平已经有一床全宿舍最漂亮的铺盖。他还买了一顶坟帐，几个月前就撑起来——现在没有蚊子，他只是想给自己创一个独立的天地，以便躺进去不受干扰地看书。另外，他还买了一双新皮鞋。皮鞋是工作人的标志；再说，穿上也确实带劲！ \n　　少平回到这个乱七八糟的住处后，看见其他人都在床上躺着。他知道，大\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
