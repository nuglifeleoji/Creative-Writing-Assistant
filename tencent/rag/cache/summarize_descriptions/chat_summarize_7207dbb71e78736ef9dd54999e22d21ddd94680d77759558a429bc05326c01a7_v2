This attribute is highly valued in his universe, as it provides a strategic advantage against forces reliant on prescience.  \n\nSonia is connected to Duncan Idaho through her role as the consort of his ghola (a cloned replica). In this capacity, she played a pivotal role in uncovering a hidden spice hoard, a discovery of great importance given the central role of melange (spice) in their society. The relationship between Sonia and Duncan Idahoâ€™s ghola suggests a deeper involvement in the political and resource-driven conflicts of their time.  \n\nTogether, these details paint a picture of Duncan Idaho as a genetically unique individual with critical strategic value, while Sonia emerges as a key figure in uncovering vital resources, further intertwining their roles in the broader narrative.
