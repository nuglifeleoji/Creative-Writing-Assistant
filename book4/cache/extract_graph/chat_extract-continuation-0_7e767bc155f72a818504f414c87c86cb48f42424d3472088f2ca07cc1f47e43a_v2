可是少安当个生产队长，没什么空子。如果父子俩因为打窑误了冬工，一年下来又要出粮钱。再说，就是钻下两个土洞子，做门窗的钱又从哪里来？这穷山穷水长不起来树，木料贵得怕死人……但所有这些愁肠事加起来，也没有他大女儿兰花的熬煎大了。死女子当初不听他的话，硬是跟了罐子村这个二流子，家里经常吃了上顿没下顿。他想起女儿拉扯着两个孩子，一个人在门里门外操劳，嘴唇一年四季缀着白疱，手象男人的手一样铺满老茧的时候，常常忍不住在山里抱住头哭半天。他更心疼两个小外孙——这是孙家的第三代人啊！为了不让娃娃们受苦，他几乎满年四季让这两个亲爱的小东西住在他家。这当然又给地增加了大负担，可这没有办法啊！如果这两个孩子有个好父亲，还要他操这么大的心吗？ \n　　他现在机械地拿着铁锨往架子车上装土，驼了背的高大身躯尽量弯下来。他不愿让众人看他，他也无脸看众人。他真想抡起铁锨，把眼前这个不知羞耻的女婿砍倒在地上！不要脸的东西！你成这个熊样子了，还能什么哩！你不想想，你那老婆娃娃这阵儿在家里硒惶成个甚了！ \n　　孙玉厚想：等收工以后，他回家吃点饭，就到罐子村走一趟，把猫蛋和狗蛋接回来——他并不知道，他女儿抱着两个娃娃已经到他家里了。 \n                  第6章\n　　孙玉厚的家里现在乱成了一团。兰花正哭得鼻子一把泪一把，给她妈叙说扛枪的人怎样把她男人从家里拉走了。这个善良的，不识字的女人，根本不能判断这种事的深浅。起先，她以为人家要把男人拉出去枪毙呀。直到后来，村里人才告诉她，王满银被拉到她娘家村里“劳教”去了。她于是在公路边把放学回家的兰香挡住，让妹妹看住她的家门，自己拉扯着两个孩子赶到了娘家的门上，打问看公家如何处置她男人。她现在其它事什么也不考虑，只关心她男人的命运。听双水村的人说，现在四个人装土，让她男人推着车子跑，还有扛枪的人跟在屁股后面照着。她的心都要碎了！娃娃的老子没受过苦，这不几天就把他的命要了吗？还听说人家强迫她父亲给满银装土；父亲是个爱面子人，说不定会臊得寻了短见。 \n　　兰花现在最着急的是，她大弟弟少安不在家。家里出了这么大的事，如果少安在，众人心里还有个依托。可是少安到米家镇办事去了。 \n　　顺便说说，这米家镇虽属外县，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
