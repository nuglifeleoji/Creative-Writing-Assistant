His animosity stems from memories of being tortured by the Harkonnens on Giedi Prime, an ordeal that left deep psychological scars. These experiences have shaped his perception of the Harkonnens as ruthless oppressors, fueling his resentment toward them.  \n\nBeyond his personal suffering, Duncan also preserves the historical memory of past wars against the Harkonnens, speaking of their long-standing conflicts with a sense of solemnity. His recollections serve as a reminder of the brutal tactics employed by the Harkonnens and their enduring legacy of violence.  \n\nWhile Duncanâ€™s hatred is deeply personal, it is also intertwined with a broader historical narrative, reflecting the enduring enmity between his people and the Harkonnens. His perspective underscores the lasting impact of their cruelty, both on individuals like himself and on the collective memory of those who have opposed them.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751252033, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 75}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
