Does he suggest they have spies among...”\n“He swears not. | taxed him with this and he said that a successful ghola would be sure to create a visible disturbance among us.”\n“What visible disturbance? What is he...”\n“He will not say. He returns each time to the claim that they have met their contractual obligations. Where is the ghola, Tar?”\n“What... oh. On Gammu.”\n“I hear rumors of...”\n“Burzmali has the situation well in hand.” Taraza closed her mouth tightly, hoping that was the truth. The most recent report did not fill her with confidence.\n“You obviously are debating whether to have the ghola killed,” Odrade said.\n“Not just the ghola!”\nOdrade smiled. “Then it’s true that Bellonda wants me permanently eliminated.”\n“How did you...”\n“Friendships can be a very valuable asset at times, Tar.”\n“You tread on dangerous ground, Reverend Mother Odrade.”\n“But | am not stumbling, Mother Superior Taraza. | am thinking long hard thoughts about the things Waff has revealed about those Honored Matres.”\n“Tell me some of your thoughts.” There was implacable determination in Taraza’s voice.\n“Let us make no mistakes about this,” Odrade said. “They have surpassed the sexual skills of our Imprinters.”\n“Whores!”\n“Yes, they employ their skills in a way ultimately fatal to themselves and others. They have been blinded by their own power.”\n“Is that the extent of your long hard thoughts?”\n“Tell me, Tar, why did they attack and obliterate our Keep on Gammu?”\n“Obviously they were after our Idaho ghola, to capture him or kill him.”\n“Why would that be so important to them?”\n“What are you trying to say?” Taraza demanded.\n“Could the whores have been acting upon information revealed to them by the Tleilaxu? Tar, what if this secret thing Waff’s people have introduced into our ghola is something that would make the ghola a male equivalent of the Honored Matres?”\nTaraza put a hand to her mouth and dropped it quickly when she saw how much the gesture revealed. It was too late. No matter. They were still two Reverend Mothers together.\nOdrade said: “And we have ordered Lucilla to make him irresistible to most women.”\n“How long have the Tleilaxu been dealing with those whores?” Taraza demanded.\nOdrade shrugged. “A better question is this: How long have they been dealing with their own Lost Ones returned\nfrom the Scattering? Tleilaxu speak to Tleilaxu and many secrets could be revealed.”\n“A brilliant projection on your part,” Taraza said. “What probability value do you attach to it?”\n“You know that as well as | do. It would explain many things.”\nTaraza spoke bitterly. “What do you think of your alliance with the Tleilaxu now?”\n“More necessary than ever. We must be on the inside. We must be where we can influence those who contend.”\n“Abomination!” Taraza snapped.\n“What?”\n“This ghola is like a recording device in human shape. They have planted him in our midst. If the Tleilaxu get their hands on him they will know many things about us.”\n“That would be clumsy.”\n“And typical of them!”\n“I agree that there are other implications in our situation,” Odrade said. “But such arguments only tell me that we dare not kill the ghola until we have examined him ourselves.”\n“That might be too late! Damn your alliance, Dar! You gave them a hold on us... and us a hold on them—and neither of us dares let go.”\n“Is that not the perfect alliance?”\nTaraza sighed. “How soon must we give them access to our breeding records?”\n“Soon. Waff is pressing the matter.”\n“Then, will we see their axlotl . . . tanks?”\n“That is, of course, the lever | am using. He has given his reluctant agreement.”\n“Deeper and deeper into each other’s pockets,” Taraza growled.\nHer tone all innocence, Odrade said: “A perfect alliance, just as | said.”\n“Damn, damn, damn,” Taraza muttered. “And Teg has reawakened the ghola’s original memories!”\n“But has Lucilla...”\n“I don’t know!” Taraza turned a grim expression on Odrade and recounted the most recent reports from Gammu: Teg and his party located, the briefest of accounts about them and nothing from Lucilla; plans made to bring them out.\nHer own words produced an unsettling picture in Taraza’s mind. What was this ghola? They had always known the Duncan Idahos were not ordinary gholas. But now, with augmented nerve and muscle capabilities plus this unknown thing the Tleilaxu had introduced—it was like holding a burning club. You knew you might have to use the club for your own survival but the flames approached at a terrifying speed.\nOdrade spoke in a musing tone: “Have you ever tried to imagine what it must be like for a ghola suddenly to awaken in renewed flesh?”\n“What? What are you...”\n“Realizing that your flesh was grown from the cells of a cadaver,” Odrade said. “He remembers his own death.”\n“The Idahos were never ordinary people,” Taraza said.\n“The same may be said for these Tleilaxu Masters.”\n“What are you trying to say?”\nOdrade rubbed her own forehead, taking a moment to review her thoughts. This was so difficult with someone who rejected affection, with someone who thrust outward from a core of rage. Taraza had no...no simpatico. She could not assume the flesh and senses of another except as an exercise in logic.\n“A ghola’s awakening must be a shattering experience,” Odrade said, lowering her hand. “Only the ones with enormous mental resilience would survive.”\n“We assume that the Tleilaxu Masters are more than they appear to be.”\n“And the Duncan Idahos?”\n“Of course. Why else would the Tyrant keep buying them from the Tleilaxu?”\nOdrade saw that the argument was pointless. She said: “The Idahos were notoriously loyal to the Atreides and we must remember that | am Atreides.”\n“You think loyalty will bind this one to you?”\n“Especially after Lucilla—”\n“That may be too dangerous!”\nOdrade sat back into a corner of the divan. Taraza wanted certainty. And the lives of the serial gholas were like melange, presenting a different taste in different Surroundings. How could they be sure of their ghola?\n“The Tleilaxu meddle with the forces that produced our Kwisatz Haderach,” Taraza muttered.\n“You think that’s why they want our breeding records?”\n“| don’t know! Damn you, Dar! Don’t you see what you’ve done?”\n“I think | had no choice,” Odrade said.\nTaraza produced a cold smile. Odrade’s performance remained superb but she needed to be put in her place.\n“You think | would have done the same?” Taraza asked.\nShe still does not see what has happened to me, Odrade thought. Taraza had expected her pliant Dar to act with independence but the extent of that independence had Shaken the High Council. Taraza refused to see her own hand in this.\n“Customary practice,” Odrade said.\nThe words struck Taraza like a slap in the face. Only the hard training of a Bene Gesserit lifetime prevented her from Striking out violently at Odrade.\nCustomary practice!\nHow many times had Taraza herself revealed this as a source of irritation, a constant goad to her carefully capped rage? Odrade had heard it often.\nOdrade quoted the Mother Superior now: “Immovable custom is dangerous. Enemies can find a pattern and use it\nagainst you.”\nThe words were forced from Taraza: “That is a weakness, yes.”\n“Our enemies thought they knew our way,” Odrade said. “Even you, Mother Superior, thought you knew the limits within which | would perform. | was like Bellonda. Before she even spoke, you knew what Bellonda would say.”\n“Have we made a mistake, not elevating you above me?” Taraza asked. She spoke from her deepest allegiance.\n“No, Mother Superior. We walk a delicate path but both of us can see where we must go.”\n“Where is Waff now?” Taraza asked.\n“Asleep and well guarded.”\n“Summon Sheeana. We must decide whether to abort that part of the project.”\n“And take our lumps?”\n“AS you Say, Dar.”\nSheeana was still sleepy and rubbing her eyes when she appeared in the common room but she obviously had taken the time to splash water on her face and dress in a clean white robe. Her hair was still damp.\nTaraza and Odrade stood near an eastern window with their backs to the light.\n“This is Sheeana, Mother Superior,” Odrade said.\nSheeana came fully alert with an abrupt stiffening of her back. She had heard of this powerful woman, this Taraza, who ruled the Sisterhood from a distant citadel called Chapter House. Sunlight was bright in the window behind the two women, shining full into Sheeana’s face, dazzling her. It left the faces of the two Reverend Mothers partly obscured, the black outlines of their figures fuzzy in the brilliance.\nAcolyte instructors had prepared her against this encounter: “You stand at attention before the Mother Superior and speak respectfully. Respond only when she speaks to you.”\nSheeana stood at rigid attention the way she had been told.\n“lam informed that you may become one of us,” Taraza said.\nBoth women could see the effect of this on the girl. By now, Sheeana was more fully aware of a Reverend Mother’s accomplishments. The powerful beam of truth had been focused on her. She had begun to grasp at the enormous body of knowledge the Sisterhood had accumulated over the millennia. She had been told about selective memory transmission, about the workings of Other Memories, about the spice agony. And here before her stood the most powerful of all Reverend Mothers, one from whom nothing was hidden.\nWhen Sheeana did not respond, Taraza said: “Have you nothing to say, child?”\n“What is there to say, Mother Superior? You have said it all.”\nTaraza sent a searching glance at Odrade. “Have you any other little surprises for me, Dar?”\n“I told you she was superior,” Odrade said.\nTaraza returned her attention to Sheeana. “Are you proud of that opinion, child?”\n“It frightens me, Mother Superior.”\nStill holding her face as immobile as she could, Sheeana breathed more easily. Say only the deepest truth you can sense, she reminded herself. Those warning words from a teacher carried more meaning now. She kept her eyes Slightly unfocused and aimed at the floor directly in front of the two women, avoiding the worst of the brilliant sunlight. She still felt her heart beating too rapidly and knew the Reverend Mothers would detect this. Odrade had demonstrated it many times.\n“Well it should frighten you,” Taraza said.\nOdrade asked: “Do you understand what is being said to you, Sheeana?”\n“The Mother Superior wishes to know if | am fully committed to the Sisterhood,” Sheeana said.\nOdrade looked at Taraza and shrugged. There was no need for more discussion of this between them. That was the way of it when you were part of one family as they were in the Bene Gesserit.\nTaraza continued her silent study of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_40c8af1d5551fc0f838490e6cab7daf6e2188393d08ad3e5ff5d71769626dc3e_v2"}
