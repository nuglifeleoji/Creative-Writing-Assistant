The Gom Jabbar serves as both a test and a tool, administered by the Bene Gesserit to evaluate an individual's humanity. This deadly device is used to determine whether a subject possesses the self-control and awareness required to transcend primal instincts. By subjecting individuals to the Gom Jabbar, the Bene Gesserit assess their capacity for higher reasoning and discipline, key traits the sisterhood values. The test is a defining moment in their interactions with outsiders, reflecting the Bene Gesserit's overarching influence and their meticulous approach to shaping human evolution.  \n\nIn summary, the Gom Jabbar is an essential element of Bene Gesserit doctrine, functioning as a lethal yet purposeful mechanism to separate true humans from mere animals.
