就儿子，他老两口才奔跑着调到黄原来工作了。因为“儿媳妇”调到了团地委，老两口划算他们调上来后，再活动着把向前也调到黄原，这样，向前和润叶在一个城市里，就能多见面，多接触，时间一长，兴许两个人还能过在一块哩。为了儿子的幸福，登云宁愿放弃当原西县一把手，而屈驾到地区当了个“无足轻重”的卫生局长。他多年的愿望就是独挡一面领导一个县。为了儿子，他只能牺牲了自己的政治理想。 \n　　但所有这一切都没能改变向前和润叶的关系。向前说什么也不来黄原工作。他说他在原西长大，那里熟人多，县运输公司对他又好；要是到了黄原，他急忙习惯不了。实际上，主要是润叶和他闹别扭，他就索性离她远一点，躲个眼不见，也少点烦恼。这个窝囊废儿子能把他们活活气死；既然是这样，为什么又不离婚呢？ \n　　可话说回来，他老两口也太幼稚了；就是向前调到黄原，向前和润叶就能过在一块吗？当年他们不都在原西县城吗？两口子只要合心，天南海北又有什么关系！ \n　　几年来，他们夫妇俩已经被儿子的婚姻问题折磨得心衰力竭。 \n　　可谁又能想到，还有这么大的灾祸在等待他们！天啊，要是志英知道了眼前的惨祸该怎么办？ \n　　“志英，志英，志英……”李登云象死人一般堆瘫在椅子里，嘴里喃喃地念叨着老伴的名字。 \n　　“李局长，我看还是把刘书记也接来……”卫生局的干事嗫嚅着说。 \n　　李登云闭住眼痛苦地咧了咧嘴。是呀，纸里包不住火，这事迟早要让他妈知道。应该把志英接来……他仍然闭着眼，说：“侯师，你去接向前他妈……”卫生局的司机立刻出去了。 \n　　时间不知不觉过了四个钟头……现在，已经是夜里十一点钟。 \n　　不久，穿白大褂的医院院长走出急诊室，一看李局长这副模样，竟不知怎样安慰他。他迟疑了一下，对局长说：“手术已经完了。情况都很好……” \n　　“很好？什么叫情况很好？两条腿都保住了？”李登云嘴角象受了委屈的儿童那般抽动着；痛苦已使他不能自己，竟用一种刻薄的语言极没水平地讥讽院长。 \n　　院长不敢计较局长的混帐话。当然，如果普通病人的家属丧失理智对他如此出言不逊，他会立刻拂袖而去。院长尴尬地苦笑了一下，说：“孩子已经进入单间病房，特级护理。你现在可以去看看了。” \n　　院长说着，便和卫生局的干事搀扶起垮掉的李登云，出了急诊室，来到住院部的单间�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
