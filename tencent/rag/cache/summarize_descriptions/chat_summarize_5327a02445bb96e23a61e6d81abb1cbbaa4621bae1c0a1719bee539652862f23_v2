Referenced by **Siona** and others, it contains critical information about **Leto II’s breeding program**, the **Bene Gesserit’s religious engineering**, and the **Fremen’s deification of Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib)**. While sometimes considered an unofficial or mythological record, it does not fundamentally contradict the **Formal History** on major events, particularly regarding the **Atreides lineage**, the **Worm (Shai-Hulud)**, and the effects of **spice-essence on sandworms**.  \n\nThe Oral History includes **mythological accounts** discovered at **Dar-es-Balat**, such as the **history of Shuloch**, the **brides of Leto**, and the **caliphate of Muad’Dib’s heirs**. It also preserves the **Voice of Shai-Hulud**, **Fremen songs**, and **knowledge of spice treasures**, some of which were omitted from official records. Despite **priestly prohibitions**, it maintains the lineage of key figures on **Rakis (Arrakis)**.  \n\nFunctioning as both a **rebel ideological foundation** and a **counterpoint to the God Emperor’s narrative**, the Oral History underscores the Fremen practice of **oral transmission**, ensuring that their traditions, **sayings**, and **legends** endure across generations.
