Without melange, the Sisterhood’s Reverend Mothers could not perform their feats of observation and human control. Without melange, the Guild’s Steersmen could not navigate across space. Without melange, billions upon billions of Imperial citizens would die of addictive withdrawal.\nWithout melange, Paul-Muad’Dib could not prophesy.\nWe know this moment of supreme power contained failure. There can be only one answer, that completely accurate and total prediction is lethal.\nOther histories say Muad’Dib was defeated by obvious plotters—the Guild, the Sisterhood and the scientific amoralists of the Bene Tleilax with their Face-Dancer disguises. Other histories point out the spies in Muad’Dib’s household. They make much of the Dune Tarot which clouded Muad’Dib’s powers of prophecy. Some show how\nMuad’Dib was made to accept the services of a ghola, the flesh brought back from the dead and trained to destroy him. But certainly they must know this ghola was Duncan Idaho, the Atreides lieutenant who perished saving the life of the young Paul.\nYet, they delineate the Qizarate cabal guided by Korba the Panegyrist. They take us step by step through Korba’s plan to make a martyr of Muad’Dib and place the blame on Chani, the Fremen concubine.\nHow can any of this explain the facts as history has revealed them? They cannot. Only through the lethal nature of prophecy can we understand the failure of such enormous and far-seeing power.\nHopefully, other historians will learn something from this revelation.\n—Analysis of History: Muad’Dib by Bronso of Ix\nThere exists no separation between gods and men; one blends softly casual into the other.\n—PROVERBS OF MUAD'DIB\nespite the murderous nature of the plot he hoped to devise, the thoughts of Scytale, the Tleilaxu Face Dancer, returned again and again to rueful compassion.\n| shall regret causing death and misery to Muad’Dib, he told himself.\nHe kept this benignity carefully hidden from his fellow conspirators. Such feelings told him, though, that he found it easier to identify with the victim than with the attackers— a thing characteristic of the Tleilaxu.\nScytale stood in bemused silence somewhat apart from the others. The argument about psychic poison had been going on for some time now. It was energetic and vehement, but polite in that blindly compulsive way adepts of the Great Schools always adopted for matters close to their dogma.\n“When you think you have him skewered, right then you'll find him unwounded!”\nThat was the old Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, Gaius Helen Mohiam, their hostess here on Wallach IX. She was a black-robed stick figure, a witch crone seated ina floater chair at Scytale’s left. Her aba hood had been thrown back to expose a leathery face beneath silver hair. Deeply pocketed eyes stared out of skull-mask features.\nThey were using a mirabhasa language, honed phalange consonants and joined vowels. It was an instrument for conveying fine emotional subtleties. Edric, the Guild Steersman, replied to the Reverend Mother now with a vocal curtsy contained in a sneer—a lovely touch of disdainful politeness.\nScytale looked at the Guild envoy. Edric swam ina container of orange gas only a few paces away. His container sat in the center of the transparent dome which the Bene Gesserit had built for this meeting. The Guildsman was an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membranous hands—a fish in a strange sea. His tank’s vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange.\n“If we go on this way, we'll die of stupidity!”\nThat was the fourth person present—the potential member of the conspiracy—Princess Irulan, wife (but not mate, Scytale reminded himself) of their mutual foe. She stood at a corner of Edric’s tank, a tall blond beauty, splendid in a robe of blue whale fur and matching hat. Gold buttons glittered at her ears. She carried herself with an aristocrat’s hauteur, but something in the absorbed smoothness of her features betrayed the controls of her Bene Gesserit background.\nScytale’s mind turned from nuances of language and faces to nuances of location. All around the dome lay hills mangy with melting snow which reflected mottled wet blueness from the small blue-white sun hanging at the meridian.\nWhy this particular place? Scytale wondered. The Bene Gesserit seldom did anything casually. Take the dome’s open plan: a more conventional and confining space might've inflicted the Guildsman with claustrophobic nervousness. Inhibitions in his psyche were those of birth and life off-planet in open space.\nTo have built this place especially for Edric, though—what a sharp finger that pointed at his weakness.\nWhat here, Scytale wondered, was aimed at me?\n“Have you nothing to say for yourself, Scytale?” the Reverend Mother demanded.\n“You wish to draw me into this fools’ fight?” Scytale asked. “Very well. We’re dealing with a potential messiah.\nYou don’t launch a frontal attack upon such a one. Martyrdom would defeat us.”\nThey all stared at him.\n“You think that’s the only danger?” the Reverend Mother demanded, voice wheezing.\nScytale shrugged. He had chosen a bland, round-faced appearance for this meeting, jolly features and vapid full lips, the body of a bloated dumpling. It occurred to him now, as he studied his fellow conspirators, that he had made an ideal choice—out of instinct perhaps. He alone in this group could manipulate fleshly appearance across a wide spectrum of bodily shapes and features. He was the human chameleon, a Face Dancer, and the shape he wore now invited others to judge him too lightly.\n“Well?” the Reverend Mother pressed.\n“I was enjoying the silence,” Scytale said. “Our hostilities are better left unvoiced.”\nThe Reverend Mother drew back, and Scytale saw her reassessing him. They were all products of profound prana- bindu training, capable of muscle and nerve control that few humans ever achieved. But Scytale, a Face Dancer, had muscles and nerve linkages the others didn’t even possess plus a special quality of sympatico, a mimic’s insight with which he could put on the psyche of another as well as the other’s appearance.\nScytale gave her enough time to complete the reassessment, said: “Poison!” He uttered the word with the atonals which said he alone understood its secret meaning.\nThe Guildsman stirred and his voice rolled from the glittering speaker globe which orbited a corner of his tank above Irulan. “We're discussing psychic poison, not a physical one.”\nScytale laughed. Mirabhasa laughter could flay an opponent and he held nothing back now.\nlrulan smiled in appreciation, but the corners of the Reverend Mother’s eyes revealed a faint hint of anger.\n“Stop that!” Mohiam rasped.\nScytale stopped, but he had their attention now, Edric in a silent rage, the Reverend Mother alert in her anger, Irulan amused but puzzled.\n“Our friend Edric suggests,” Scytale said, “that a pair of Bene Gesserit witches trained in all their subtle ways have not learned the true uses of deception.”\nMohiam turned to stare out at the cold hills of her Bene Gesserit homeworld. She was beginning to see the vital thing here, Scytale realized. That was good. Irulan, though, was another matter.\n“Are you one of us or not, Scytale?” Edric asked. He stared out of tiny rodent eyes.\n“My allegiance is not the issue,” Scytale said. He kept his attention on Irulan. “You are wondering, Princess, if this was why you came all those parsecs, risked so much?”\nShe nodded agreement.\n“Was it to bandy platitudes with a humanoid fish or dispute with a fat Tleilaxu Face Dancer?” Scytale asked.\nShe stepped away from Edric’s tank, shaking her head in annoyance at the thick odor of melange.\nEdric took this moment to pop a melange pill into his mouth. He ate the spice and breathed it and, no doubt, drank it, Scytale noted. Understandable, because the spice heightened a Steersman’s prescience, gave him the power to guide a Guild heighliner across space at translight speeds. With spice awareness he found that line of the Ship’s future which avoided peril. Edric smelled another kind of peril now, but his crutch of prescience might not find it.\n“I think it was a mistake for me to come here,” Irulan said.\nThe Reverend Mother turned, opened her eyes, closed them, a curiously reptilian gesture.\nScytale shifted his gaze from Irulan to the tank, inviting the Princess to share his viewpoint. She would, Scytale knew, see Edric as a repellent figure: the bold stare, those\nmonstrous feet and hands moving softly in the gas, the smoky swirling of orange eddies around him. She would wonder about his sex habits, thinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one. Even the field-force generator which recreated for Edric the weightlessness of space would set him apart from her now.\n“Princess,” Scytale said, “because of Edric here, your husband’s oracular sight cannot stumble upon certain incidents, including this one. . . presumably.”\n“Presumably,” Irulan said.\nEyes closed, the Reverend Mother nodded. “The phenomenon of prescience is poorly understood even by its initiates,” she said.\n“lam a full Guild Navigator and have the Power,” Edric said.\nAgain, the Reverend Mother opened her eyes. This time, she stared at the Face Dancer, eyes probing with that peculiar Bene Gesserit intensity. She was weighing minutiae.\n“No, Reverend Mother,” Scytale murmured, “Il am not as simple as | appeared.”\n“We don’t understand this Power of second sight,” Irulan said. “There’s a point. Edric says my husband cannot see, know or predict what happens within the sphere of a Navigator’s influence. But how far does that influence extend?”\n“There are people and things in our universe which | know only by their effects,” Edric said, his fish mouth held ina thin line. “I know they have been here...there... somewhere. As water creatures stir up the currents in their passage, so the prescient stir up Time. | have seen where your husband has been; never have | seen him nor the people who truly share his aims and loyalties. This is the concealment which an adept gives to those who are his.”\n“Irulan is not yours,” Scytale said. And he looked sideways at the Princess.\n“We all know why the conspiracy must be conducted only in my presence,” Edric said.\nUsing the voice mode for describing a machine, Irulan said: “You have your uses, apparently.”\nShe sees him now for what he is, Scytale thought. Good!\n“The future is a thing to be shaped,” Scytale said. “Hold that thought, Princess.”\nlrulan glanced at the Face Dancer.\n“People who share Paul’s aims and loyalties,” she said. “Certain of his Fremen legionaries, then, wear his cloak. | have seen him prophesy for them, heard\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5eacc63e461677e69022be0545af3ac431c954cf0fcf28442d9b9fbba105271a_v2"}
