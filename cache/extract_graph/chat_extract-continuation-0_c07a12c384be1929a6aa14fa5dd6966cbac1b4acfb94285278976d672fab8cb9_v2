The two prisoners, returned to the streets in their new finery, only compounded the growing mythology. The Sisterhood, artists in mythology, possessed on Rakis a ready-made energy to be subtly amplified and directed.\n“We have fed a wish-fulfillment belief into the populace,” Tamalane reported. She thought of the Bene Gesserit- originated phrases as she reread her latest report.\n“Sheeana is the one we have long awaited.”\nIt was a simple enough statement that its meaning could be spread without unacceptable distortion.\n“The Child of Shai-hulud comes to chastise the priests!”\nThat one had been a bit more complicated. A few priests died in dark alleys as a result of popular fervency. This had fed a new alertness into the corps of priestly enforcers with predictable injustices inflicted upon the populace.\nTamalane thought of the priestly delegation that had waited upon Sheeana as a result of turmoil among Tuek’s councillors. Seven of them led by Stiros had intruded upon Sheeana’s luncheon with a child from the streets. Knowing that this would happen, Tamalane had been prepared and a secret recording of the incident had been brought to her, the words audible, every expression visible, the thoughts quite apparent to a Reverend Mother’s trained eye.\n“We were sacrificing to Shai-hulud!” Stiros protested.\n“Tuek told you not to argue with me about that,” Sheeana said.\nHow the priestesses smiled at the discomfiture of Stiros and the other priests!\n“But Shai-hulud—” Stiros began.\n“Shaitan!” Sheeana corrected him and her expression was easily read: Did these stupid priests know nothing?\n“But we have always thought—”\n“You were wrong!” Sheeana stamped a foot.\nStiros feigned the need for instruction. “Are we to believe that Shai-hulud, the Divided God, is also Shaitan?”\nWhat a complete fool he was, Tamalane thought. Even a pubescent girl could confound him, as Sheeana proceeded to do.\n“Any child of the streets knows this almost as soon as she can walk!” Sheeana ranted.\nStiros spoke slyly: “How do you know what is in the minds of street children?”\n“You are evil to doubt me!” Sheeana accused. It was an answer she had learned to use often, Knowing it would get back to Tuek and cause trouble.\nStiros knew this only too well. He waited with downcast eyes while Sheeana, speaking with heavy patience as one\ntelling an old fable to a child, explained to him that either god or devil or both could inhabit the worm of the desert. Humans had only to accept this. It was not left to humans to decide such things.\nStiros had sent people into the desert for speaking such heresy. His expression (so carefully recorded for Bene Gesserit analysis) said such wild concepts were always springing up from the muck at the bottom of the Rakian heap. But now! He had to contend with Tuek’s insistence that Sheeana spoke gospel truth!\nAs she looked at the recording, Tamalane thought the pot was boiling nicely. This she reported to Chapter House. Doubts flogged Stiros; doubts everywhere except among the populace in their devotion to Sheeana. Spies close to Tuek said he was even beginning to doubt the wisdom of his decision to translate the historian-locutor, Dromind.\n“Was Dromind right to doubt her?” Tuek demanded of those around him.\n“Impossible!” the sycophants said.\nWhat else could they say? The High Priest could make no mistake in such decisions. God would not allow it. Sheeana clearly confounded him, though. She put the decisions of many previous High Priests into a terrible limbo. Reinterpretation was being demanded on all sides.\nStiros kept pounding at Tuek: “What do we really know about her?”\nTamalane had a full account of the most recent such confrontation. Stiros and Tuek alone, debating far into the night, just the two of them (they thought) in Tuek’s quarters, comfortably ensconced in rare blue chairdogs, melange- laced confits close at hand. Tamalane’s holophoto record of the meeting showed a single yellow glowglobe drifting on its suspensors close above the pair, the light dimmed to ease the strain on tired eyes.\n“Perhaps that first time, leaving her in the desert with a thumper, was not a good test,” Stiros said.\nIt was a sly statement. Tuek was noted for not having an excessively complicated mind. “Not a good test? Whatever do you mean?”\n“God might wish us to perform other tests.”\n“You have seen her yourself! Many times in the desert talking to God!”\n“Yes!” Stiros almost pounced. Clearly, it was the response he wanted. “If she can stand unharmed in the presence of God, perhaps she can teach others how this is accomplished.”\n“You know this angers her when we suggest it.”\n“Perhaps we have not approached the problem in quite the right way.”\n“Stiros! What if the child is right? We serve the Divided God. | have been thinking long and earnestly upon this. Why would God divide? Is this not God’s ultimate test?”\nThe expression on Stiros’ face said this was exactly the kind of mental gymnastics his faction feared. He tried to divert the High Priest but Tuek was not to be shifted from a single-track plunge into metaphysics.\n“The ultimate test,” Tuek insisted. “To see the good in evil and the evil in good.”\nStiros’ expression could only be described as consternation. Tuek was God’s Supreme Anointed. No priest was allowed to doubt that! The thing that might now arise if Tuek went public with such a concept would shake the foundations of priestly authority! Clearly, Stiros was asking himself if the time had not come to trans/ate his High Priest.\n“|I would never suggest that | might debate such profound ideas with my High Priest,” Stiros said. “But perhaps | can offer a proposal that might resolve many doubts.”\n“Propose then,” Tuek said.\n“Subtle instruments could be introduced in her clothing. We might listen when she talks to—”\n“Do you think God would not know what we did?”\n“Such a thought never crossed my mind!”\n“I will not order her taken into the desert,” Tuek said.\n“But if it is her own idea to go?” Stiros assumed his most ingratiating expression. “She has done this many times.”\n“But not recently. She appears to have lost her need to consult with God.”\n“Could we not offer suggestions to her?” Stiros asked.\n“Such as?”\n“Sheeana, when will you speak again with your Father? Do you not long to stand once more in His presence?”\n“That has more the sound of prodding than suggestion.”\n“Lam only proposing that—”\n“This Holy Child is no simpleton! She talks to God, Stiros. God might punish us sorely for such presumption.”\n“Did God not put her here for us to study?” Stiros asked.\nThis was too close to the Dromind heresy for Tuek’s liking. He sent a baleful stare at Stiros.\n“What | mean,” Stiros said, “is that surely God means us to learn from her.”\nTuek himself had said this many times, never hearing in his own words a curious echo of Dromind’s words.\n“She is not to be prodded and tested,” Tuek said.\n“Heaven forbid!” Stiros said. “I will be the soul of holy caution. And everything | learn from the Holy Child will be reported to you immediately.”\nTuek merely nodded. He had his own ways to be sure Stiros spoke the truth.\nThe subsequent sly proddings and testings were reported immediately to Chapter House by Tamalane and her subordinates.\n“Sheeana has a thoughtful look,” Tamalane reported.\nAmong the Reverend Mothers on Rakis and those to whom they reported, this thoughtful look had an obvious interpretation. Sheeana’s antecedents had been deduced long ago. Stiros’ intrusions were making the child homesick. Sheeana kept a wise silence but she clearly thought much about her life in a pioneer village. Despite all of the fears\nand perils, those obviously had been happy times for her. She would remember the laughter, poling the sand for its weather, hunting scorpions in the crannies of the village hovels, smelling out spice fragments in the dunes. From Sheeana’s repeated trips to the area, the Sisterhood had made a reasonably accurate guess as to the location of the lost village and what had happened to it. Sheeana often stared at one of Tuek’s old maps on the wall of her quarters.\nAs Tamalane expected, one morning Sheeana stabbed a finger at the place on the wall map where she had gone many times. “Take me there,” Sheeana commanded her attendants.\nA 'thopter was summoned.\nWhile priests listened avidly in a ‘thopter hovering far overhead, Sheeana once more confronted her nemesis in the sand. Tamalane and her advisors, tuned into the priestly circuits, observed just as avidly.\nNothing even remotely suggesting a village remained on the duneswept waste where Sheeana ordered herself deposited. She used a thumper this time, however. Another of Stiros’ sly suggestions accompanied by careful instructions on use of the ancient means to summon the Divided God.\nA worm came.\nTamalane watched on her own relay projector, thinking the worm only a middling monster. Its length she estimated at about fifty meters. Sheeana stood only about three meters in front of the gaping mouth. The huffing of the worm’s interior fires was clearly audible to the observers.\n“Will you tell me why you did it?” Sheeana demanded.\nShe did not flinch from the worm’s hot breath. Sand crackled beneath the monster but she gave no sign that she heard.\n“Answer me!” Sheeana commanded.\nNo voice came from the worm but Sheeana appeared to be listening, her head cocked to one side.\n“Then go back where you came from,” Sheeana said. She waved the worm away.\nObediently, the worm backed off and returned beneath the sands.\nFor days, while the Sisterhood spied upon them with glee, the priests debated that sparse encounter. Sheeana could not be questioned lest she learn that she had been overheard. As before, she refused to discuss anything about her visits to the desert.\nStiros continued his sly prodding. The result was precisely what the Sisterhood expected. Without any warning, Sheeana would awaken some days and Say: “Today, | will go into the desert.”\nSometimes she used a thumper, sometimes she danced her summons. Far out on the sands beyond the sight of Keen or any other inhabited place, the worms came to her. Sheeana alone in front of a worm talked to it while others listened. Tamalane found the accumulated recordings fascinating as they passed through her hands on their way to Chapter House.\n“I should hate you!”\nWhat a turmoil that caused among the priests! Tuek wanted an open debate: “Should all of us hate the Divided God at the same time we love Him?”\nStiros barely shut off this suggestion with the argument that God’s wishes had not been made clear.\nSheeana asked one of her gigantic visitors: “Will you let me ride you again?”\nWhen she approached, the worm retreated and would not let her mount.\nOn another occasion, she asked: “Must | stay with the priests?”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTER HOUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chapter House is the central hub of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, where reports and decisions are made)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, a powerful and secretive organization that manipulates events and beliefs for their own purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>A Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, responsible for overseeing operations on Rakis and reporting to Chapter House)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl known as the Holy Child, who can communicate with the sandworms and is a central figure in the religious and political turmoil on Rakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STIROS<|>PERSON<|>A priest on Rakis who is skeptical of Sheeana's divine connection and seeks to test her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUEK<|>PERSON<|>The High Priest of Rakis, who is conflicted about Sheeana's role and the implications for the priesthood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DROMIND<|>PERSON<|>A historian-locutor who doubted Sheeana's divine status and was translated (killed) for his heresy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>The desert planet where the events take place, home to the sandworms and the priesthood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>EVENT<|>The sandworms of Rakis, worshipped as the Divided God by the local populace)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHATTAN<|>EVENT<|>Another name for the sandworms, used by Sheeana to correct the priests)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMALANE<|>CHAPTER HOUSE<|>Tamalane reports to Chapter House about the events on Rakis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMALANE<|>SHEEANA<|>Tamalane monitors and manipulates Sheeana's actions for the Bene Gesserit's purposes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>Sheeana can communicate with and command the sandworms, which are worshipped as Shai-hulud<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>STIROS<|>Sheeana confounds and frustrates Stiros, who seeks to test her divine connection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>TUEK<|>Sheeana's actions and statements cause Tuek to doubt the priesthood's doctrines<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STIROS<|>TUEK<|>Stiros attempts to manipulate Tuek into testing Sheeana further<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUEK<|>DROMIND<|>Tuek had Dromind killed for doubting Sheeana, but now questions his own decision<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE SISTERHOOD<|>RAKIS<|>The Bene Gesserit manipulate events and beliefs on Rakis for their own ends<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>RAKIS<|>Sheeana is a central figure in the religious and political turmoil on Rakis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STIROS<|>RAKIS<|>Stiros is a priest on Rakis who seeks to maintain the priesthood's authority<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TUEK<|>RAKIS<|>Tuek is the High Priest of Rakis, struggling with the implications of Sheeana's actions<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
