常伟恩将军说：“同志们，这次与会的所有人，对目前形势都有了基本的了解，用大史的话说，信息对等了。人类与外星侵略者的战争已经开始，虽然在四个半世纪后，我们的子孙才会真正面对来自异星的三体人侵者，我们现在与之作战的仍是人类；但从本质上讲，这些人类的背叛者也可以看成来自地球文明之外的敌人，我们是第一次面对这样的敌人。下一步的作战目标十分明确，就是要夺取‘审判日’号上被截留的三体信息，这些信息，可能对人类文明的存亡具有重要意义。\n     “我们还没有惊动‘审判日’号，这艘巨轮目前仍以合法的身份行驶在大西洋上，它已向巴拿马运河管理局提出申请，将于四天后通过运河。这是我们采取行动的一次绝好的机会，随着形势的发展，很可能不会再有这样的机会了。现在，全球的各个作战中心都在制定行动方案，这些方案将由总部在十小时之内选择并确定一个。我们这次会议的任务，就是讨论行动方案，最后确定一至三个最可行的上报总部。各位，时间很紧，我们必须以最高效率工作。”\n     “请注意，所有方案都要确保一点：保证  ‘审判日’号上三体信息的安全并夺取得它。  ‘审判日’号是由油轮改装的，船体上层和内部都增加了复杂的结构，据说即使是船员，在进人不常去的区域时也要凭借地图认路，我们对其结构的了解就更少了。目前，我们甚至不知道‘审判日’号计算机中心的确切位置，也不知道被截留的三体信息是否存贮于计算机中心的服务器上、有几个备份。我们要达到目标的唯一途径，就是全面占领和控制‘审判日’号，这中间最困难的，就是在攻击行动中避免敌人删除三体信息。删除这些信息极其容易，敌人在紧急时刻不太可能进行常规删除，因为以目前的技术很容易恢复，但只需对服务器硬盘或其他存贮装置打上一梭子，一切就都完了，这前后在十秒钟内就能完成。而我们\n######################\nOutput:",
