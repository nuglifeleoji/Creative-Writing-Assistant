His objective in evaluating 蜀寨 is to gain insights into the movements of the蜀兵, the military forces of Shu. This intelligence is vital for planning his military strategies and operations.\n\nIn addition to gathering intelligence, 司马懿 also aims to launch an offensive to capture 蜀寨. This endeavor is part of his broader strategy to expand the territory of the Wei Kingdom, which he serves. By seizing control of 蜀寨, 司马懿 seeks to weaken the Shu forces and enhance Wei's strategic position in the ongoing power struggles of the era.\n\nOverall, 司马懿's actions reflect his dual focus on intelligence gathering and military conquest, highlighting his role as a key figure in the complex dynamics of the Three Kingdoms period.
