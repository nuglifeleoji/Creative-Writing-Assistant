Giant worms. And you're really thinking about the Tyrant, Leto II, whose endless dream is carried as a pearl of awareness in each of those worms. Or so we are led to believe.\nSchwangyu nodded toward the child on the lawn below them. “Do you think their ghola will be able to influence the girl who controls the worms?”\nWe’re peeling away the skin at last, Lucilla thought. She said: “I have no need for the answer to such a question.”\n“You are a cautious one,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla arched her back and stretched. Cautious? Yes, indeed! Taraza had warned her: “Where Schwangyu is concerned, you must act with extreme caution but with speed. We have a very narrow window of time within which we can succeed.”\nSucceed at what? Lucilla wondered. She glanced sideways at Schwangyu. “I don’t see how the Tleilaxu could succeed in killing eleven of these gholas. How could they get through our defenses?”\n“We have the Bashar now,” Schwangyu said. “Perhaps he can prevent disaster.” Her tone said she did not believe this. Mother Superior Taraza had said: “You are the Imprinter, Lucilla. When you get to Gammu you will recognize some of the pattern. But for your task you have no need for the full\ndesign.”\n“Think of the cost!” Schwangyu said, glaring down at the ghola, who now squatted, pulling at tufts of grass.\nCost had nothing to do with it, Lucilla knew. The open admission of failure was much more important. The Sisterhood could not reveal its fallibility. But the fact that an Imprinter had been summoned early—that was vital. Taraza had known the Imprinter would see this and recognize part of the pattern.\nSchwangyu gestured with one bony hand at the child, who had returned to his solitary play, running and tumbling on the grass.\n“Politics,” Schwangyu said.\nNo doubt Sisterhood politics lay at the core of Schwangyu’s heresy, Lucilla thought. The delicacy of the internal argument could be deduced from the fact that\nSchwangyu had been put in charge of the Keep here on Gammu. Those who opposed Taraza refused to sit on the sidelines.\nSchwangyu turned and looked squarely at Lucilla. Enough had been said. Enough had been heard and screened through minds trained in Bene Gesserit awareness. The Chapter House had chosen this Lucilla with great care.\nLucilla felt the older woman’s careful examination but refused to let this touch that innermost sense of purpose upon which every Reverend Mother could rely in times of stress. Here. Let her look fully upon me. Lucilla turned and set her mouth in a soft smile, passing her gaze across the rooftop opposite them.\nA uniformed man armed with a heavy-duty lasgun appeared there, looked once at the two Reverend Mothers and then focused on the child below them.\n“Who is that?” Lucilla asked\n“Patrin, the Bashar’s most trusted aide. Says he’s only the Bashar’s batman but you'd have to be blind and a fool to believe that.”\nLucilla examined the man across from them with care. So that was Patrin. A native of Gammu, Taraza had said. Chosen for this task by the Bashar himself. Thin and blond, much too old now to be soldiering, but then the Bashar had been called back from retirement and had insisted Patrin must share this duty.\nSchwangyu noted the way Lucilla shifted her attention from Patrin to the ghola with real concern. Yes, if the Bashar had been called back to guard this Keep, then the ghola was in extreme peril.\nLucilla started in sudden surprise. “Why... he’s...”\n“Miles Teg’s orders,” Schwangyu said, naming the Bashar. “All of the ghola’s play is training play. Muscles are to be prepared for the day when he is restored to his original self.”\n“But that’s no simple exercise he’s doing down there,” Lucilla said. She felt her own muscles respond\nsympathetically to the remembered training.\n“We hold back only the Sisterhood’s arcana from this ghola,” Schwangyu said. “Almost anything else in our storehouse of knowledge can be his.” Her tone said she found this extremely objectionable.\n“Surely, no one believes this ghola could become another Kwisatz Haderach,” Lucilla objected.\nSchwangyu merely shrugged.\nLucilla held herself quite still, thinking. Was it possible the ghola could be transformed into a male version of a Reverend Mother? Could this Duncan Idaho learn to look inward where no Reverend Mother dared?\nSchwangyu began to speak, her voice almost a growling mutter: “The design of this project... they havea dangerous plan. They could make the same mistake .. .” She broke off.\nThey, Lucilla thought. Their ghola.\n“I would give anything to know for sure the position of Ix and the Fish Speakers in this,” Lucilla said.\n“Fish Speakers!” Schwangyu shook her head at the very thought of the remnant female army that had once served only the Tyrant. “They believe in truth and justice.”\nLucilla overcame a sudden tightness in her throat. Schwangyu had all but declared open opposition. Yet, she commanded here. The political rule was a simple one: Those who opposed the project must monitor it that they might abort it at the first sign of trouble. But that was a genuine Duncan Idaho ghola down there on the lawn. Cell comparisons and Truthsayers had confirmed it.\nTaraza had said: “You are to teach him love in all of its forms.”\n“He’s so young,” Lucilla said, keeping her attention on the ghola.\n“Young, yes,” Schwangyu said. “So, for now, | presume you will awaken his childish responses to maternal affection. Later...” Schwangyu shrugged.\nLucilla betrayed no emotional reaction. A Bene Gesserit obeyed. / am an /lmprinter. So... Taraza’s orders and the Imprinter’s specialized training defined a particular course of events.\nTo Schwangyu, Lucilla said: “There is someone who looks like me and speaks with my voice. | am Imprinting for her. May | ask who that is?”\n“No.”\nLucilla held her silence. She had not expected revelation but it had been remarked more than once that she bore a striking resemblance to Senior Security Mother Darwi Odrade. “A young Odrade.” Lucilla had heard this on several occasions. Both Lucilla and Odrade were, of course, in the Atreides line with a strong backbreeding from Siona descendants. The Fish Speakers had no monopoly on those genes! But the Other Memories of a Reverend Mother, even with their linear selectivity and confinement to the female side, provided important clues to the broad shape of the ghola project. Lucilla, who had come to depend on her experiences of the Jessica persona buried some five thousand years back in the Sisterhood’s genetic manipulations, felt a deep sense of dread from that source now. There was a familiar pattern here. It gave off such an intense feeling of doom that Lucilla fell automatically into the Litany Against Fear as she had been taught it in her first introduction to the Sisterhood’s rites:\n“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little- death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\nCalm returned to Lucilla.\nSchwangyu, sensing some of this, allowed her guard to drop slightly. Lucilla was no dullard, no specia/ Reverend Mother with an empty title and barely sufficient background to function without embarrassing the Sisterhood. Lucilla was\nthe real thing and some reactions could not be hidden from her, not even reactions of another Reverend Mother. Very well, let her know the full extent of the opposition to this foolish, this dangerous project!\n“I do not think their ghola will survive to see Rakis,” Schwangyu said.\nLucilla let this pass. “Tell me about his friends,” she said.\n“He has no friends; only teachers.”\n“When will | meet them?” She kept her gaze on the opposite parapet where Patrin leaned idly against a low pillar, his heavy lasgun at the ready. Lucilla realized with an abrupt shock that Patrin was watching her. Patrin was a message from the Bashar! Schwangyu obviously saw and understood. We guard him!\n“| presume it’s Miles Teg you’re so anxious to meet,” Schwangyu said.\n“Among others.”\n“Don’t you want to make contact with the ghola first?”\n“I’ve already made contact with him.” Lucilla nodded toward the enclosed yard where the child once more stood almost motionless and looking up at her. “He’s a thoughtful one.”\n“I’ve only the reports on the others,” Schwangyu said, “but | suspect this is the most thoughtful one of the series.”\nLucilla suppressed an involuntary shudder at the readiness for violent opposition in Schwangyu’s words and attitude. There was not one hint that the child below them shared a common humanity.\nWhile Lucilla was thinking this, clouds covered the sun as they often did here at this hour. A cold wind blew in over the Keep’s walls, swirling around the courtyard. The child turned away and picked up the speed of his exercises, getting his warmth from increased activity.\n“Where does he go to be alone?” Lucilla asked.\n“Mostly to his room. He has tried a few dangerous escapades, but we have discouraged this.”\n“He must hate us very much.”\n“I’m sure of it.”\n“I will have to deal with that directly.”\n“Surely, an Imprinter has no doubts about her ability to overcome hate.”\n“I was thinking of Geasa.” Lucilla sent a knowing look at Schwangyu. “I find it astonishing that you let Geasa make such a mistake.”\n“| don’t interfere with the normal progress of the ghola’s instructions. If one of his teachers develops a real affection for him, that is not my problem.”\n“An attractive child,” Lucilla said.\nThey stood a bit longer watching the Duncan Idaho ghola at his training-play. Both Reverend Mothers thought briefly of Geasa, one of the first teachers brought here for the ghola project. Schwangyu’s attitude was plain: Geasa was a providential failure. Lucilla thought only: Schwangyu and Geasa complicated my task. Neither woman gave even a passing moment to the way these thoughts reaffirmed their loyalties.\nAs she watched the child in the courtyard, Lucilla began to have a new appreciation of what the Tyrant God Emperor had actually achieved. Leto II had employed this ghola-type through uncounted lifetimes—some thirty-five hundred years of them, one after another. And the God Emperor Leto Il had been no ordinary force of nature. He had been the biggest juggernaut in human history, rolling over everything: over social systems, over natural and unnatural hatreds, over governmental forms, over rituals (both taboo and mandatory), over religions casual and religions intense. The crushing weight of the Tyrant’s passage had left nothing unmarked, not even the Bene Gesserit.\nLeto Il had called it “The Golden Path” and this Duncan Idaho-type ghola below her now had figured prominently in that awesome passage. Lucilla had studied the Bene Gesserit accounts, probably the best in the universe. Even\ntoday on most of the old Imperial Planets, newly married couples still scattered dollops of water east and west, mouthing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d626182eef8bed775b301273a65f06b418ce58033cf2c77ac050b8400d9f32b0_v2"}
