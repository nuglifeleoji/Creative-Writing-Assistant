The Great Honored Matre suspects Buzzell may be a trap due to its significance. The planet has also been the site of troubling incidents, including the abduction of **Reverend Mothers** by strangers—likely Honored Matres—who later brought them to **Dama**. Additionally, legends speak of an old witch once held on Buzzell before being taken to Dama, further entwining the planet with the power struggles of the era.  \n\nDespite its perilous state, Buzzell remains a key stronghold for the Bene Gesserit, though its future is uncertain amid ongoing losses in their planetary holdings.
