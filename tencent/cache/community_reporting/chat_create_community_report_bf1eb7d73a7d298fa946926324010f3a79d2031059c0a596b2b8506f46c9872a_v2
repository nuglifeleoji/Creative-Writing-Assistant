This creature, initially innocent and endowed with life and thought, embodies the narrator's inner turmoil and self-loathing. As the narrative unfolds, the monster struggles with its identity and yearns for acceptance within human society, yet it is met with fear and rejection due to its terrifying appearance and misunderstood intentions.\n\nThe monster represents a duality of threat and promise, symbolizing both the narrator's deep-seated fears and the potential for connection and understanding. It is described as a sinister figure that embodies evil and manipulation, reflecting the darker aspects of the narrator's psyche. The creature's existence serves as a constant reminder of the consequences of Victor's ambition and the moral implications of playing God.\n\nInitially, the monster sought virtue and happiness, but societal rejection and misunderstanding transformed it into a being of despair and destruction. This transformation is marked by a profound sense of alienation, as the monster becomes a representation of what happens when one is cast out by society. The narrator, who also identifies as a monster, expresses feelings of self-loathing and isolation, suggesting a deep connection between creator and creation.\n\nThe monster is not merely a physical threat; it symbolizes the narrator's internal struggles and the emotional turmoil stemming from guilt and responsibility. It is portrayed as a potential danger to Victor's family, highlighting the consequences of Victor's actions and the monster's desire for revenge against its creator. The creature's pursuit of Victor culminates in a tragic cycle of violence and despair, as both are trapped in their respective roles of creator and creation.\n\nIn summary, the \"\"怪物\"\" is a profound symbol of the complexities of human emotion, the quest for acceptance, and the consequences of isolation. It serves as a reflection of Victor Frankenstein's own fears and failures, ultimately representing the darker aspects of humanity and the struggle for identity in a world that often rejects those who are different.

This particular detail intensifies the horror of the scene, as the moonlight not only serves as a source of illumination but also accentuates the grim reality of the situation. The juxtaposition of the serene beauty of moonlight with the stark and unsettling imagery of death creates a compelling contrast that deepens the emotional impact.\n\nOverall, \"\"月光\"\" is portrayed as a dual force—while it brings light into darkness, it simultaneously reveals the chilling truths hidden within that light, thus establishing a haunting atmosphere that resonates throughout the narrative.\",4\r\n685,弗兰肯斯坦先生,\"The father of the little boy, a municipal official, and an enemy of the narrator.\",3\r\n733,村落,村落是山间若隐若现的小型居住区，展现了人类与自然的和谐共处。这些村落通常由少数居民组成，形成一个紧密的社区，提供信息和支持。村落不仅是居住的地方，更是人们生活、交流和相互帮助的空间，体现了人与自然之间的平衡与共生关系。,3\r\n274,法兰绒寿衣,法兰绒寿衣是主角梦中与死去的母亲相关的物品，象征着死亡和失去。,1\r\n276,宿舍楼,宿舍楼是主角在噩梦后躲避怪物的地方，象征着安全与恐惧的对立。,1\r\n281,窗幔,窗幔是主角梦中怪物掀起的物品，象征着恐惧的显现。,1\r\n282,声音,声音是怪物发出的含糊不清的声音，增加了梦境的恐怖感。,1\r\n287,街,街道是叙述者在恐惧中漫无目的行走的地方，象征着他内心的迷茫,1\r\n379,塞拉维山,塞拉维山是一个位于普兰帕里斯南边的小山，具有重要的象征意义。在叙述中，塞拉维山被描绘为一个显著的障碍，怪物能够轻松攀爬这座山，反映出其强大的能力和对追逐者的威胁。此外，文中提到的凶手在塞拉维山上攀爬并最终消失，这一情节进一步强调了这座山在故事中的关键角色。塞拉维山不仅是物理上的障碍，也象征着追求与逃避之间的斗争，成为叙述中不可或缺的一部分。,1\r\n381,痛苦的回忆,\"The emotional turmoil and painful memories that the narrator experiences, reflecting on the consequences of creating the monster.\",1\r\n810,承诺,,1\r\n809,山洞,\"The cave serves as another potential hiding place for the monster, symbolizing isolation and the depths of fear that the narrator experiences.\",1\r\n1012,肯斯坦,肯斯坦是一个能言善辩的人，曾因其所作所为而被他人指责为虚伪的魔鬼。,1\r\n1041,盲爷爷,,1\r\n1039,青年男女,\"The young couple are characters who initially encounter the monster and react with fear and aggression, impacting the monster's perception of humanity.\",1\r\n1040,《少年维特之烦恼》,\"The Sorrows of Young Werther is a literary work that the monster reads, influencing his understanding of art and love.\",1\r\n807,大海,\"The entity \"\"大海\"\" (the sea) serves as a multifaceted symbol within the narrative, embodying both tranquility and a significant emotional landscape for the characters involved.
