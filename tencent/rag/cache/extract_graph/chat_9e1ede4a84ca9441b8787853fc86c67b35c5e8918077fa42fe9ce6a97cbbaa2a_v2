A lout shoved me.”\nPaul ignored the words after the first few. There was no feeling in them except a kind of ritual fear. He found himself, instead, thinking that he had come a long way from his boyhood days in Caladan Castle. Where had he put his foot\non the path that led to this journey across a crowded square on a planet so far from Caladan? Had he really put his foot on a path? He could not say he had acted at any point in his life for one specific reason. The motives and impinging forces had been complex—more complex possibly than any other set of goads in human history. He had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid the fate he could see so clearly along this path. But the crowd pushed him forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way, lost personal direction over his life.\nThe crowd flowed with him up the steps now into the temple portico. Voices grew hushed. The smell of fear grew stronger—acrid, sweaty.\nAcolytes had already begun the service within the temple. Their plain chant dominated the other sounds—whispers, rustle of garments, shuffling feet, coughs—telling the story of the Far Places visited by the Priestess in her holy trance.\nShe rides the sandworm of space! She guides through all storms Into the land of gentle winds. Though we sleep by the snake’s den, She guards our dreaming souls. Shunning the desert heat,\nShe hides us in a cool hollow.\nThe gleaming of her white teeth Guides us in the night.\nBy the braids of her hair\nWe are lifted up to heaven! Sweet fragrance, flower-scented, Surrounds us in her presence.\nBalak! Paul thought, thinking in Fremen. Look out! She can be filled with angry passion, too.\nThe temple portico was lined with tall, slender glow-tubes simulating candle flame. They flickered. The flickering stirred ancestral memories in Paul even while he knew that was the intent. This setting was an atavism, subtly contrived, effective. He hated his own hand in it.\nThe crowd flowed with him through tall metal doors into the gigantic nave, a gloomy place with the flickering lights far away overhead, a brilliantly illuminated altar at the far end. Behind the altar, a deceptively simple affair of black wood encrusted with sand patterns from the Fremen mythology, hidden lights played on the field of a pru-door to create a rainbow borealis. The seven rows of chanting acolytes ranked below that spectral curtain took on an eerie quality: black robes, white faces, mouths moving in unison.\nPaul studied the pilgrims around him, suddenly envious of their intentness, their air of listening to truths he could not hear. It seemed to him that they gained something here which was denied to him, something mysteriously healing.\nHe tried to inch his way closer to the altar, was stopped by a hand on his arm. Paul whipped his gaze around, met the probing stare of an ancient Fremen—blue-blue eyes beneath overhanging brows, recognition in them. A name flashed into Paul’s mind: Rasir, a companion from the sietch days.\nIn the press of the crowd, Paul knew he was completely vulnerable if Rasir planned violence.\nThe old man pressed close, one hand beneath a sand- grimed robe—grasping the hilt of a crysknife, no doubt. Paul set himself as best he could to resist attack. The old man moved his head toward Paul’s ear, whispered: “We will go with the others.”\nIt was the signal to identify his guide. Paul nodded.\nRasir drew back, faced the altar.\n“She comes from the east,” the acolytes chanted. “The sun stands at her back. All things are exposed. In the full glare of light—her eyes miss no thing, neither light nor dark.”\nA wailing rebaba jarred across the voices, stilled them, receded into silence. With an electric abruptness, the crowd surged forward several meters. They were packed into a\ntight mass of flesh now, the air heavy with their breathing and the scent of spice. “Shai-hulud writes on clean sand!” the acolytes shouted. Paul felt his own breath catch in unison with those around him. A feminine chorus began singing faintly from the Shadows behind the shimmering pru-door: “Alia... Alia... Alia...” It grew louder and louder, fell to a sudden silence. Again—voices beginning vesper-soft:\nShe stills all storms—\nHer eyes kill our enemies, And torment the unbelievers. From the spires of Tuono Where dawnlight strikes\nAnd clear water runs,\nYou see her shadow.\nIn the shining summer heat She serves us bread and milk— Cool, fragrant with spices.\nHer eyes melt our enemies, Torment our oppressors\nAnd pierce all mysteries.\nShe is Alia... Alia . . . Alia...\nSlowly, the voices trailed off.\nPaul felt sickened. What are we doing? he asked himself. Alia was a child witch, but she was growing older. And he thought: Growing older is to grow more wicked.\nThe collective mental atmosphere of the temple ate at his psyche. He could sense that element of himself which was one with those all around him, but the differences formed a deadly contradiction. He stood immersed, isolated in a personal sin which he could never expiate. The immensity of the universe outside the temple flooded his awareness. How could one man, one ritual, hope to knit such immensity into a garment fitted to all men?\nPaul shuddered.\nThe universe opposed him at every step. It eluded his grasp, conceived countless disguises to delude him. That\nuniverse would never agree with any shape he gave it.\nA profound hush spread through the temple.\nAlia emerged from the darkness behind the shimmering rainbows. She wore a yellow robe trimmed in Atreides green —yellow for sunlight, green for the death which produced life. Paul experienced the sudden surprising thought that Alia had emerged here just for him, for him alone. He stared across the mob in the temple at his sister. She was his sister. He knew her ritual and its roots, but he had never before stood out here with the pilgrims, watched her through their eyes. Here, performing the mystery of this place, he saw that she partook of the universe which opposed him.\nAcolytes brought her a golden chalice.\nAlia raised the chalice.\nWith part of his awareness, Paul knew that the chalice contained the unaltered melange, the subtle poison, her sacrament of the oracle.\nHer gaze on the chalice, Alia sooke. Her voice caressed the ears, flower sound, flowing and musical:\n“In the beginning, we were empty,” she said.\n“Ignorant of all things,” the chorus sang.\n“We did not know the Power that abides in every place,” Alia said.\n“And in every Time,” the chorus sang.\n“Here is the Power,” Alia said, raising the chalice slightly.\n“It brings us joy,” sang the chorus.\nAnd it brings us distress, Paul thought.\n“It awakens the soul,” Alia said.\n“It dispels all doubts,” the chorus sang.\n“In worlds, we perish,” Alia said.\n“In the Power, we survive,” sang the chorus.\nAlia put the chalice to her lips, drank.\nTo his astonishment, Paul found he was holding his breath like the meanest pilgrim of this mob. Despite every shred of personal knowledge about the experience Alia was\nundergoing, he had been caught in the tao-web. He felt himself remembering how that fiery poison coursed into the body. Memory unfolded the time-stopping when awareness became a mote which changed the poison. He reexperienced the awakening into timelessness where all things were possible. He knew Alia’s present experience, yet he saw now that he did not know it. Mystery blinded the eyes.\nAlia trembled, sank to her knees.\nPaul exhaled with the enraptured pilgrims. He nodded. Part of the veil began to lift from him. Absorbed in the bliss of a vision, he had forgotten that each vision belonged to all those who were still on-the-way, still to become. In the vision, one passed through a darkness, unable to distinguish reality from insubstantial accident. One hungered for absolutes which could never be.\nHungering, one lost the present.\nAlia swayed with the rapture of spice change.\nPaul felt that some transcendental presence spoke to him, saying: “Look! See there! See what you’ve ignored?” In that instant, he thought he looked through other eyes, that he Saw an imagery and rhythm in this place which no artist or poet could reproduce. It was vital and beautiful, a glaring light that exposed all power-gluttony ... even his own.\nAlia spoke. Her amplified voice boomed across the nave.\n“Luminous night,” she cried.\nA moan swept like a wave through the crush of pilgrims.\n“Nothing hides in such a night!” Alia said. “What rare light is this darkness? You cannot fix your gaze upon it! Senses cannot record it. No words describe it.” Her voice lowered. “The abyss remains. It is pregnant with all the things yet to be. Ahhhhh, what gentle violence!”\nPaul felt that he waited for some private signal from his sister. It could be any action or word, something of wizardry and mystical processes, an outward streaming that would fit\nhim like an arrow into a cosmic bow. This instant lay like quivering mercury in his awareness.\n“There will be sadness,” Alia intoned. “I remind you that all things are but a beginning, forever beginning. Worlds wait to be conquered. Some within the sound of my voice will attain exalted destinies. You will sneer at the past, forgetting what | tell you now: within all differences there is unity.”\nPaul suppressed a cry of disappointment as Alia lowered her head. She had not said the thing he waited to hear. His body felt like a dry shell, a husk abandoned by some desert insect.\nOthers must feel something similar, he thought. He sensed the restlessness about him. Abruptly, a woman in the mob, someone far down in the nave to Paul’s left, cried out, a wordless noise of anguish.\nAlia lifted her head and Paul had the giddy sensation that the distance between them collapsed, that he stared directly into her glazed eyes only inches away from her.\n“Who summons me?” Alia asked.\n“I do,” the woman cried. “I do, Alia. Oh, Alia, help me. They say my son was killed on Muritan. Is he gone? Will | never see my son again... never?”\n“You try to walk backward in the sand,” Alia intoned. “Nothing is lost. Everything returns later, but you may not recognize the changed form that returns.”\n“Alia, | don’t understand!” the woman wailed.\n“You live in the air but you do not see it,” Alia said, sharpness in her voice. “Are you a lizard? Your voice has the Fremen accent. Does a Fremen try to bring back the dead? What do we need from our dead except their water?”\nDown in the center of the nave, a man in a rich red cloak lifted both hands, the sleeves falling to expose white-clad arms. “Alia,” he shouted, “I have had a business proposal. Should | accept?”\n“You come here like a beggar,” Alia said. “You look for the golden bowl but you will find only a dagger.”\n“I have been asked to kill a man!” a voice shouted from off to the right—a deep voice with si\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9e1ede4a84ca9441b8787853fc86c67b35c5e8918077fa42fe9ce6a97cbbaa2a_v2"}
