Everything returns later, but you may not recognize the changed form that returns.”\n“Alia, | don’t understand!” the woman wailed.\n“You live in the air but you do not see it,” Alia said, sharpness in her voice. “Are you a lizard? Your voice has the Fremen accent. Does a Fremen try to bring back the dead? What do we need from our dead except their water?”\nDown in the center of the nave, a man in a rich red cloak lifted both hands, the sleeves falling to expose white-clad arms. “Alia,” he shouted, “I have had a business proposal. Should | accept?”\n“You come here like a beggar,” Alia said. “You look for the golden bowl but you will find only a dagger.”\n“I have been asked to kill a man!” a voice shouted from off to the right—a deep voice with sietch tones. “Should | accept? Accepting, would | succeed?”\n“Beginning and end are a single thing,” Alia snapped. “Have | not told you this before? You didn’t come here to ask that question. What is it you cannot believe that you must come here and cry out against it?”\n“She’s in a fierce mood tonight,” a woman near Paul muttered. “Have you ever seen her this angry?”\nShe knows I’m out here, Paul thought. Did she see something in the vision that angered her? Is she raging at me?\n“Alia,” a man directly in front of Paul called. “Tell these businessmen and faint-hearts how long your brother will rule!”\n“| permit you to look around that corner by yourself,” Alia snarled. “You carry your prejudice in your mouth! It is because my brother rides the worm of chaos that you have roof and water!”\nWith a fierce gesture, clutching her robe, Alia whirled away, strode through the shimmering ribbons of light, was lost in the darkness behind.\nImmediately, the acolytes took up the closing chant, but their rhythm was off. Obviously, they’d been caught by the unexpected ending of the rite. An incoherent mumbling arose on all sides of the crowd. Paul felt the stirring around him—restless, dissatisfied.\n“It was that fool with his stupid question about business,” a woman near Paul muttered. “The hypocrite!”\nWhat had Alia seen? What track through the future?\nSomething had happened here tonight, souring the rite of the oracle. Usually, the crowd clamored for Alia to answer their pitiful questions. They came as beggars to the oracle, yes. He had heard them thus many times as he’d watched,\nhidden in the darkness behind the altar. What had been different about this night?\nThe old Fremen tugged Paul’s sleeve, nodded toward the exit. The crowd already was beginning to push in that direction. Paul allowed himself to be pressed along with them, the guide’s hand upon his sleeve. There was the feeling in him then that his body had become the manifestation of some power he could no longer control. He had become a non-being, a stillness which moved itself. At the core of the non-being, there he existed, allowing himself to be led through the streets of his city, following a track so familiar to his visions that it froze his heart with grief.\n| should know what Alia saw, he thought. / have seen it enough times myself. And she didn’t cry out against it... she saw the alternatives, too.\nProduction growth and income growth must not get out of step in my Empire. That is the substance of my command. There are to be no balance- of-payment difficulties between the different spheres of influence. And the reason for this is simply because | command it. | want to emphasize my authority in this area. | am the supreme energy-eater of this domain, and will remain so, alive or dead. My Government is the economy.\n—ORDER IN COUNCIL THE EMPEROR PAUL MUAD’DIB\n44 | will leave you here,” the old man said, taking his hand\nfrom Paul’s sleeve. “It is on the right, second door from the far end. Go with Shai-hulud, Muad’Dib... and remember when you were Usul.”\nPaul’s guide slipped away into the darkness.\nThere would be Security men somewhere out there waiting to grab the guide and take the man to a place of questioning, Paul knew. But Paul found himself hoping the old Fremen would escape.\nThere were stars overhead and the distant light of First Moon somewhere beyond the Shield Wall. But this place was not the open desert where a man could sight on a star to guide his course. The old man had brought him into one of the new suburbs; this much Paul recognized.\nThis street now was thick with sand blown in from encroaching dunes. A dim light glowed from a single public suspensor globe far down the street. It gave enough illumination to show that this was a dead-end street.\nThe air around him was thick with the smell of a reclamation still. The thing must be poorly capped for its fetid odors to escape, loosing a dangerously wasteful amount of moisture into the night air. How careless his people had grown, Paul thought. They were millionaires of water—forgetful of the days when a man on Arrakis could\nhave been killed for just an eighth share of the water in his body.\nWhy am I hesitating? Paul wondered. /t is the second door from the far end. | knew that without being told. But this thing must be played out with precision. So... I hesitate.\nThe noise of an argument arose suddenly from the corner house on Paul’s left. A woman there berated someone: the new wing of their house leaked dust, she complained. Did he think water fell from heaven? If dust came in, moisture got out.\nSome remember, Paul thought.\nHe moved down the street and the quarrel faded away behind.\nWater from heaven! he thought.\nSome Fremen had seen that wonder on other worlds. He had seen it himself, had ordered it for Arrakis, but the memory of it felt like something that had occurred to another person. Rain, it was called. Abruptly, he recalled a rainstorm on his birthworld—clouds thick and gray in the sky of Caladan, an electric storm presence, moist air, the big wet drops drumming on skylights. It ran in rivulets off the eaves. Storm drains took the water away to a river which ran muddy and turgid past the Family orchards. . . trees there with their barren branches glistening wetly.\nPaul’s foot caught in a low drift of sand across the street. For an instant, he felt mud clinging to the shoes of his childhood. Then he was back in the sand, in the dust- clotted, wind-muffled darkness with the Future hanging over him, taunting. He could feel the aridity of life around him like an accusation. You did this! They'd become a civilization of dry-eyed watchers and taletellers, people who solved all problems with power...and more power... and still more power—hating every erg of it.\nRough stones came underfoot. His vision remembered them. The dark rectangle of a doorway appeared on his right—black in black: Otheym’s house, Fate’s house, a place\ndifferent from the ones around it only in the role Time had chosen for it. It was a strange place to be marked down in history.\nThe door opened to his knock. The gap revealed the dull green light of an atrium. A dwarf peered out, ancient face on a child’s body, an apparition prescience had never seen.\n“You've come then,” the apparition said. The dwarf stepped aside, no awe in his manner, merely the gloating of a slow smile. “Come in! Come in!”\nPaul hesitated. There’d been no dwarf in the vision, but all else remained identical. Visions could contain such disparities and still hold true to their original plunge into infinity. But the difference dared him to hope. He glanced back up the street at the creamy pearl glistening of his moon swimming out of jagged shadows. The moon haunted him. How did it fall?\n“Come in,” the dwarf insisted.\nPaul entered, heard the door thud into its moisture seals behind. The dwarf passed him, led the way, enormous feet Slapping the floor, opened the delicate lattice gate into the roofed central courtyard, gestured. “They await, Sire.”\nSire, Paul thought. He knows me, then.\nBefore Paul could explore this discovery, the dwarf Slipped away down a side passage. Hope was a dervish wind whirling, dancing in Paul. He headed across the courtyard. It was a dark and gloomy place, the smell of sickness and defeat in it. He felt daunted by the atmosphere. Was it defeat to choose a lesser evil? he wondered. How far down this track had he come?\nLight poured from a narrow doorway in the far wall. He put down the feeling of watchers and evil smells, entered the doorway into a small room. It was a barren place by Fremen standards with hiereg hangings on only two walls. Opposite the door, a man sat on carmine cushions beneath the best hanging. A feminine figure hovered in shadows behind another doorway in a barren wall to the left.\nPaul felt vision-trapped. This was the way it’d gone. Where was the dwarf? Where was the difference?\nHis senses absorbed the room in a single gestalten sweep. The place had received painstaking care despite its poor furnishings. Hooks and rods across the barren walls showed where hangings had been removed. Pilgrims paid enormous prices for authentic Fremen artifacts, Paul reminded himself. Rich pilgrims counted desert tapestries as treasures, true marks of a hajj.\nPaul felt that the barren walls accused him with their fresh gypsum wash. The threadbare condition of the two remaining hangings amplified the sense of guilt.\nA narrow shelf occupied the wall on his right. It held a row of portraits—mostly bearded Fremen, some in stillsuits with their catchtubes dangling, some in Imperial uniforms posed against exotic offworld backgrounds. The most common scene was a seascape.\nThe Fremen on cushions cleared his throat, forcing Paul to look at him. It was Otheym precisely as the vision had revealed him: neck grown scrawny, a bird thing which appeared too weak to support the large head. The face was a lopsided ruin—networks of crisscrossed scars on the left cheek below a drooping, wet eye, but clear skin on the other side and a Straight, blue-in-blue Fremen gaze. A long kedge of a nose bisected the face.\nOtheym’s cushion sat in the center of a threadbare rug, brown with maroon and gold threads. The cushion fabric betrayed splotches of wear and patching, but every bit of metal around the seated figure shone from polishing—the portrait frames, shelf lip and brackets, the pedestal of a low table on the right.\nPaul nodded to the clear half of Otheym’s face, said: “Good luck to you and your dwelling place.” It was the greeting of an old friend and sietch mate.\n“So | see you once more, Usul.”\nThe voice speaking his tribal name whined with an old man’s quavering. The dull drooping eye on the ruined side of the face moved above the parchment skin and scars. Gray bristles stubbled that side and the jawline there hung with scabrous peelings. Otheym’s mouth twisted as he spoke, the gap exposing silvery metal teeth.\n“Muad’Dib always answers the call of a Fedaykin,” Paul said.\nThe woman in the doorway shadows moved, said: “So Stilgar boasts.”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a mysterious and fierce oracle figure who answers questions and provides cryptic wisdom to the people.
