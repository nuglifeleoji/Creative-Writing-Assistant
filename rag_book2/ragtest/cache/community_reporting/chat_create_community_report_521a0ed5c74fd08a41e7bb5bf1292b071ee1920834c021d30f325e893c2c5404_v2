Currently, he lives with **典子**, with whom he shares an intimate relationship, though his motives for being with her may be questionable—some suggest he deliberately sought her out.  \n\n秋吉 is described as a busy individual, often occupied with gathering materials and returning late, appearing exhausted and in poor spirits. He has a shadowy past, which he conceals, and is suspected of involvement in illicit activities, including the potential use of cyanide in a planned crime or as part of a murder method for a novel, as he is also rumored to be a writer. His professional background includes working at **Memorix Software Company**, though his current occupation remains ambiguous.  \n\nAdditionally, he has been observed engaging in suspicious behavior, such as being followed near **Shimokitazawa Station**, where he appeared to be surveilling someone or a residence. His personal history includes growing up near a park in **Osaka**, where he has strong emotional ties and childhood memories, including recounting a story about a murder.  \n\n秋吉 has also been implicated in morally dubious actions, such as being accused by **雪穗** of secretly photographing female students from **Seika High School**.
