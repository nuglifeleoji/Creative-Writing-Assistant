It is known for its bustling business districts, including the **Semba** area, and is a hub for both personal and professional activities of several key characters.  \n\n大阪 is the hometown of **唐泽雪穗 (Karazawa Yukiho)**, where she spent her childhood in a financially constrained environment that prevented her from attending private school. Though it was once her home, she no longer has family ties there. The city holds significant personal history for her: her biological mother lived and was hospitalized there, and it is also where her mother passed away. Additionally, her adoptive mother, **唐泽礼子 (Karazawa Reiko)**, had her funeral held in 大阪.  \n\nThe city is a focal point for investigations, as it is where **笹垣 (Sasagaki)**, a detective, works and where the murder case he investigates takes place. **今枝 (Imashi)** also conducts inquiries here, and it is the current residence of **手冢江利子 (Tetsuka Eriko)**.  \n\n大阪 is significant to other characters as well. **秋吉雄一 (Akiyoshi Yuichi)** grew up there and later returns with **栗原典子 (Kurihara Noriko)** to visit landmarks like **心斋桥 (Shinsaibashi)** and **道顿堀 (Dotonbori)**. 典子 stays in a hotel in the city and takes photographs during her visit. Meanwhile, **雪穗** is set to open a new branch of her boutique, **\"\"R&Y\"\"**, in 心斋桥.  \n\nThe city also connects to the past through subtle details—some plants in a victim’s garden were brought from 大阪, hinting at familial or historical links. Additionally, **永明大学 (Eimei University)**, where **诚 (Makoto)** spent four years, is located here.  \n\nIn summary, 大阪 is a dynamic urban center intertwined with the lives of multiple characters—serving as a hometown, a site of tragedy, a place of business, and a key location for investigations. It bridges personal histories, criminal events, and future ambitions, making it an essential backdrop for the narrative.\",13\n684,典子,,21\n720,婚介所,\"The 婚介所 (matchmaking service) played a significant role in the interactions between several individuals, including 栗原典子 (Noriko Kurihara) and 藤井保 (Tamotsu Fujii), as it was the platform through which they initially met. The service provided Noriko with introductions to six potential male partners, though none ultimately resulted in a successful match. Additionally, the 婚介所 served as the platform where Noriko submitted her personal details, which may have been accessed by 秋吉 (Akihoshi) through the Memorix system. This suggests that the service not only facilitated introductions but also potentially exposed users' data to third-party access.  \n\nIn summary, the 婚介所 functioned as both a matchmaking intermediary and a repository of personal information, connecting individuals like Noriko and Tamotsu while also presenting privacy risks due to possible unauthorized data access. Despite its efforts to arrange introductions, it did not lead to a lasting partnership for Noriko. The service's dual role highlights its importance in facilitating social connections while also raising concerns about data security.\",5\n726,岳父,,1\n722,妻子,典子情人的合法配偶，曾为家庭经济状况向丈夫道歉,1\n723,上班族,与典子约会三次的四十多岁男性，希望寻找能照顾痴呆母亲的伴侣,1\n724,中年女人,婚介所工作人员，负责为典子输入择偶条件,1\n192,难波站,难波站（Namba Station）是日本大阪市的一个地铁站，主要服务于地铁御堂筋线和千日前线，是这两条线路的重要换乘站。该站不仅提供便捷的交通服务，还设有商业设施，乘客可以在此购买车票以及其他商品，例如拍立得相机。难波站作为大阪市重要的交通枢纽之一，既满足了乘客的出行需求，也为日常生活提供了便利。,1\n730,大楼,\"大楼是一栋用途不明的大楼，老朽得厉害。\"\"\",1\n782,藤井,藤井是典子的朋友，曾偷看典子并注意到秋吉的行为，对典子有爱慕之情,1\n623,DESIGNMAKE,\"**DESIGNMAKE** is a company based in Osaka, Japan, specializing in interior design and related services.
