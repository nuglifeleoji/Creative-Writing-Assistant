\n　　两个好朋友久别重逢，高兴地握住手，四只眼睛忍不住泪花闪闪。 \n　　金波看来情绪很正常，忙着把给他和兰香带的礼物拿出来，又让着叫抽纸烟；少平对好朋友说他还没学会。金波于是自己一支接一支地抽，给他叙说青海的民情风俗。他外表看来没什么大变化，仍然细皮嫩肉的；只不过两颊有点发红——这是青海粗狂的风沙给他留下的唯一印记。他一边说青海的事，一边也向少平询问班里其他同学这一年多的情况。两个人一直拉谈到夜半更深，才象当年那样挤在一块睡了……金波回来后，一直没有对他解释为什么服役未满就从部队回来了。少平已是一个接近成熟的青年，也不向朋友打问这一点。 \n　　不久，谁知从什么地方传到村里一股风言，说金俊海的儿子在青海和一个藏民女子谈恋爱，叫部队打发回来了。村民们大为惊叹：这小子怎么爱上了一个外路货？啊呀，听说那些藏民女子连衣服也不穿，用手抓着吃饭，更不用说操一口谁也听不懂的卷舌头话了！金波这娃娃真是鬼迷了心窍！ \n　　少平听到这个浪漫的传闻后，倒没有过分惊讶。他了解自己的朋友。是的，金波是个不凡俗的人，而且情感又非常丰富，这传闻也许有很大程度的真实性。不过，既然朋友不愿提及这事，他也不好问他。也许金波为此事而受了精神上的创伤，内心很痛苦，不应该再去打扰他的心灵。 \n　　金波似乎对这一切都若无其事。他也变得成熟多了，看来已经脱尽了少年之气，和村里人交谈时，完全是一副大人的骨架。 \n　　只是每天临近黄昏的时候，这位复员军人却常常一个人穿上那件军大衣，神秘地爬上金家湾后面的神仙山，在山野里孤魂一般游荡着；并且反复忘情地唱那支青海民歌——在那遥远的地方，有位好姑娘； \n　　人们走过了她的帐房，都要回头留恋地张望。 \n　　她那粉红的笑脸，好象是红太阳； \n　　她那活泼动人的眼睛，好象晚上明媚的月亮。 \n　　我愿抛弃了财产，跟她去牧羊； \n　　每天看着她粉红的笑脸，和那美丽金边的衣裳。 \n　　我愿做一只小羊，跟在她身旁； \n　　我愿她拿着细细的皮鞭，不断轻轻地打在我身上……从金波的歌声中，少平已经全部体会到了朋友心中的伤感情绪。他知道，金波在唱这歌的时候，一定是满\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
