�使他忍不住泪水盈眶。他停在路边的一棵白杨树下，把烫热的脸颊贴在冰凉的树干上，两只粗糙的手抚摸着光滑的杨树皮，透过朦胧的泪眼惆怅地望着黑糊糊的远山。公路下面，东拉河的细流发出耳语似的声响。夏夜凉爽的风从川道里吹过来，摇曳着树梢和庄稼。月亮升高了，在清朗的夜空冷淡地微笑着。星星越来越繁密，象在一块巨大的青石板上缀满了银钉……孙少安在白杨树下站了一会，又开始往回走。走不多远，他就看见了双水村星星点点的灯火。 \n　　一股温暖的激流刹那间漫过了他的心间。那灯光下，有他亲爱的家——亲人们的脸庞都在他的眼前浮现出来了。 \n　　于是，头脑中迷茫的云雾顷刻间消散，滚烫的额头重新又凉了下来。他顿时感到他刚才的情绪充满了危险。是的！一家老老少少都依靠和指望着他，他怎么能这样胡思乱想呢？不，他应该象往常一样，精神抖擞地跳上这辆生活的马车，坐在驾辕的位置上，绷紧全身的肌肉和神经，吆喝着，呐喊着，继续走向前去。如果他垮了，说不定人仰马翻，一切都完了…… \n　　他弯下腰在路边拾起一块石头，抡起胳膊，狠狠地甩向了东拉河对面的山洼上，好象要把他的一切烦恼都随着这块石头抛出去。 \n　　他匆匆把外衣穿上，也没扣钮扣，就向村子里走去。 \n　　临进村子时，他为了使自己的心情平静下来，想在什么地方坐一坐。公路边不合适，万一村里有人看见他黑天半夜坐在野地里，会乱猜测的。 \n　　他于是就顺路走进一片高粱地，找了一块空地方坐下来，两只手开始麻利地卷起一支旱烟卷。 \n　　他刚抽了两口烟，就听见前面的高粱地传来一片沙沙的响声，接着，一个黑乎乎的人影向他走过来。少安仔细一瞧：竟然是父亲！ \n　　他父亲走过来，在他面前怔了一下，也没言传，就在他身边坐下来，掏出自己的旱烟锅，在烟布袋里挖来挖去。“你怎到这儿来了？你怎知道我在这里呢？”少安迷惑地望着父亲。 \n　　孙玉厚半天才咄讷地说：“我就在你后头走着……我让兰香先回去了。我怕你万一想不开……” \n　　少安鼻子一酸，竟冲动地趴在高粱地上出声地哭了。在这一刻里，在父亲的面前，他才又一次感到自己是个孩子！他需要大人的保护和温情，他也得到了这一切——唉，让他哭一阵吧，�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
