的供给完全来自前者，两者间有着繁忙的交通。随着对太空环境的适应，人们渐渐习惯了只身穿行于太空中，这时，航天服就像太空自行车，喷射推进器可以使它的时速达到五百公里，在电梯周围几百公里范围内是最方便的交通工具，现在，几乎每时每刻都有人穿着航天服在电梯和周围的空间站之间飞行。\n　　但此时，在章北海的感觉中，周围的太空是十分空旷的，除了地球——在同步轨道上已经可以看到完整的球形——和将要在其边缘落下的太阳，其他的方向都是漆黑的深渊，无数星星似乎只是闪亮的尘埃，改变不了宇宙的空虚。他知道，航天服中的生命维持系统只能维持十二个小时，这之前，他必须回到八十公里外的一号基地中去，虽然现在它看上去只是远方太空深渊上一个几乎没有形状的点。而一号基地本身，如果离开了太空电梯这条脐带，也生存不了太长的时间。\n　　但此时，他飘浮在这广大的虚空中，在感觉上已经斩断了与下面那个蓝色世界的联系，感觉自己就是宇宙中的一个独立的存在，不依附于任何世界，脚下没有大地，四周只有空间，同地球、太阳和银河系一样悬浮于宇宙中，没有从哪里来，也不想到哪里去，只是存在着，他喜欢这种感觉。\n　　他甚至想到，父亲的在天之灵可能也是这种感觉。\n　　这时，太阳开始接触地球的边缘了。\n　　章北海举起一只手，航天服手套中握着一个瞄准镜，他用这东西当望远镜观察着十公里外黄河站的一个出口，看到在宽大的弧形金属外壁上，圆形密封门仍紧闭着。\n　　他扭头看看太阳，它已经沉下去一半，成了地球的一个光芒四射的戒指。\n　　冉通过瞄准镜远望黄河站，章北海看到出口旁边的标志灯由红变绿。表示后面过渡舱中的空气已经抽空。紧接着，出口滑开了，一群穿着白色航天服的身影鱼贯而出，有三十人左右。他们集体向外飞行，投在黄河站外壁上的影子越来越大，他们需飞出一段距离，才能把背景上的空间站拍全。很快，所有人都减速停了下来，在摄影师的指挥下开始在失重环境下排队。\n　　这时，太阳已经沉下去三分之二，剩下的部分看上去像是镶嵌在地球上的一个发光体，夕照下的海洋像一面光滑的镜子，一半深蓝一半橘红，而浸透了阳光的云层像一大片覆盖在镜面上的粉红色羽毛。\n　　随着光照度的降低，远方合影的人们开始纷纷把自己的面罩调成透明，在头盔中露出自己的面容。章北海拉大了瞄准镜的焦距，很快找到了三目标，正如他所料，由于这三人的级别，他们都在最前排\n######################\nOutput:",
