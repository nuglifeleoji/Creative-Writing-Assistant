\n　　按金波说好的时间，兰香和金秀今天就要到达黄原。 \n　　一吃过早饭，少平就提着为妹妹准备好生活用品的那只花条格人造革箱子，来到东关俊海叔那里，等待他们的到来。 \n　　金俊海和少平一样兴奋。这位提前退休以便让儿子顶班的老司机，高兴得连嘴也合不拢。是啊，应该高兴！儿子招了工，女儿上了大学，作为一个普通工人，这辈子也算功成业就了…… \n　　上午十点半，金波和妹妹们就如期地到达了！少平高兴的是，他哥少安也跟车一起来了！ \n　　两家六口人热热闹闹地挤在金俊海的一间小坊里，互相激动地说个没完。 \n　　少平发现妹妹虽然穿了一身新衣服，但显然比金秀的衣服土气——金秀是时新式样的成衣，妹妹的衣服大概是嫂子给裁缝的。另外，金秀是一只大皮箱，妹妹带的是家里那只唯一的木箱——这还是当年母亲出嫁时带来的陪妆；年长日久，红油漆都脱离得斑斑驳驳。 \n　　他立刻把他买的人造革箱子和其它用品给兰香和大哥看。他同时对哥哥说：“把东西腾出来放在这只皮箱里，你把家里的箱子带回去，那箱子太旧了……” \n　　少安没想到弟弟为妹妹置办了这么多东西。他有点惭愧地说：“时间紧，我们家里来不及准备；再说，也不晓得城里过日子需要些什么……” \n　　兰香看见二哥为她考虑得这么周全，几乎都要掉眼泪了。但她是个很能克制自己感情的孩子，立在一边只是低头抠手指头。另外，她也不能过分地对二哥表示她的感激——这样会使大哥伤心的。实际上，在她离家之前，大哥也跑前扑后为她的出门操尽了心……这时候，金俊海已经开始忙碌地准备午饭了。 \n　　少安立刻跑过去制止了他。这位“冒尖户”很有气魄地宣布：为了庆贺，他要出钱在黄原最好的饭馆请两家人一块吃一桌酒席！ \n　　这样，他们就一起相跟着来到了街上。在金波的指点下，他们走进了南关的“黄原酒楼”——这正是上次少平请晓霞吃饭的地方。 \n　　不多时间，两家六口人就在摆满酒菜的圆桌前坐下来了。 \n　　少安捏着玻璃酒杯，手微微地有些抖，说：“太高兴了……，真不知该说些什么。几年前，咱们做梦也想不到有这一天……”他的眼睛里闪着泪光，困难地咽了一口吐沫。”是因为世事变了，咱们才有这样的好前程。如今，少平和金波都当了工人，兰香和金秀又考上了大学。真是双喜临\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
