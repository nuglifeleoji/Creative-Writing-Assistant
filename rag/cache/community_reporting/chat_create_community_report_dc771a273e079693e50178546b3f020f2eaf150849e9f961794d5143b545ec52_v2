It was a center of advanced training, where notable figures such as Miles Teg received Mentat schooling and military instruction under the protection of Bene Gesserit troops. The planet was also a hub for preparing initiates for the Scattering, with millions being Shared and dispatched from its facilities.  \n\nHowever, Lampadas is equally remembered for its tragic history. It was the site of a devastating massacre by the Honored Matres, who killed four million Bene Gesserit members and set deadly traps, including no-globes rigged with explosives. The planet was ultimately destroyed by the Honored Matres, marking a catastrophic loss for the order. Despite this, some references suggest Lampadas may have survived in some capacity or remained a symbolic home for certain characters.  \n\nThe planet's terrain included wetlands, where ornithopter training courses were conducted, and it played a pivotal role in Bene Gesserit conflicts, particularly in events involving Burzmali, a Bene Gesserit operative who met his death there. Lampadas is also tied to Bene Gesserit knowledge and memories, as evidenced by Rebecca’s advisors and the \"\"horde\"\" of ancestral recollections carried by Lucilla.  \n\nWhile some descriptions hint at Lampadas being under threat or associated with past disasters, its legacy endures as both a revered educational center and a grim reminder of the Bene Gesserit’s struggles against the Honored Matres.
