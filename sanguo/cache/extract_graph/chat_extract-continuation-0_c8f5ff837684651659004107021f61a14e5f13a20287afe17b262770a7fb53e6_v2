   却说张飞饮了数杯闷酒，乘马从馆驿前过，见五六十个老人，皆在门前痛哭。飞问其故，众老人答曰：“督邮逼勒县吏，欲害刘公；我等皆来苦告，不得放入，反遭把门人赶打！”张飞大怒，睁圆环眼，咬碎钢牙，滚鞍下马，径入馆驿，把门人那里阻挡得住，直奔后堂，见督邮正坐厅上，将县吏绑倒在地。飞大喝：“害民贼！认得我么？”督邮未及开言，早被张飞揪住头发，扯出馆驿，直到县前马桩上缚住；攀下柳条，去督邮两腿上着力鞭打，一连打折柳条十数枝。玄德正纳闷间，听得县前喧闹，问左右，答曰：“张将军绑一人在县前痛打。”玄德忙去观之，见绑缚者乃督邮也。玄德惊问其故。飞曰：“此等害民贼，不打死等甚！”督邮告曰：“玄德公救我性命！”玄德终是仁慈的人，急喝张飞住手。傍边转过关公来，曰：“兄长建许多大功，仅得县尉，今反被督邮侮辱。吾思枳棘丛中，非栖鸾凤之所；不如杀督邮，弃官归乡，别图远大之计。”玄德乃取印绶，挂于督邮之颈，责之曰：据汝害民，本当杀却；今姑饶汝命。吾缴还印绶，从此去矣。”督邮归告定州太守，太守申文省府，差人捕捉。玄德、关、张三人往代州投刘恢。恢见玄德乃汉室宗亲，留匿在家不题。\n\n
