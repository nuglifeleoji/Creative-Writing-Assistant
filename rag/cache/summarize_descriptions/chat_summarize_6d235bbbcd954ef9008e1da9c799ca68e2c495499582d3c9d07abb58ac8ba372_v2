His suspicion stems from intercepted Harkonnen communications, which he interprets as evidence of her treachery. Convinced of her guilt, Hawat vows vengeance against Lady Jessica for her alleged role in the downfall of House Atreides.  \n\nWhile Hawat's conviction is firm, the descriptions do not provide conclusive proof of Lady Jessica's betrayal, leaving room for ambiguity. The intercepted communications may have been deliberately misleading or part of a Harkonnen plot to sow discord within House Atreides. Nevertheless, Hawat's belief in her guilt drives his actions and motivations, framing Lady Jessica as a traitor in his eyes.
