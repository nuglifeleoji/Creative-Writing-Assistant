He appoints 马岱, a capable general, to manage logistics and supply, ensuring that the troops are well-equipped and prepared for battle. Under孔明's leadership, 马岱 is entrusted with significant responsibilities, including assisting in troop movements and developing strategies that align with孔明's overarching military objectives.\n\n孔明 commands 马岱 to execute various military strategies, demonstrating a strong trust in his capabilities. One of the key operations involves 马岱 leading troops to set fire to the Wei army's supplies, a tactical maneuver aimed at crippling the enemy's resources. This operation highlights 马岱's role not only as a subordinate but also as a critical player in the execution of孔明's plans.\n\nIn addition to offensive strategies,孔明 instructs 马岱 to prepare supplies and troops for the defense of 盘蛇谷, showcasing the dual nature of their military efforts—both offensive and defensive. 马岱's involvement extends to participating in military strategies against 孟获, further solidifying his position as a general under孔明's command. His execution of tactical plans and military orders reflects a deep commitment to孔明's vision and objectives.\n\nThe relationship between孔明 and 马岱 is characterized by mutual trust and collaboration.孔明 provides 马岱 with a secret plan, indicating a level of confidence in his judgment and abilities. As a result, 马岱 is not only a subordinate but also a key strategist who supports孔明's military actions against the魏兵. His role as the vanguard for military campaigns underscores his importance in the overall strategy and execution of military operations.\n\nIn summary,孔明 and 马岱 work closely together in a dynamic military partnership, with孔明 providing strategic direction and 马岱 executing those strategies on the battlefield.
