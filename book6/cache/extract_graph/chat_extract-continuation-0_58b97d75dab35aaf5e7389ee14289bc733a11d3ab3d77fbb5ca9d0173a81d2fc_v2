病毒就操纵一切可能的外部硬件进行谋杀，具体表现就是你们今天经历的，好像这世界上的所有东西都想杀你，所以当时有人把这东西叫现代魔咒。有一段时间KILLER软件甚至商业化了，从网络黑市买来后，只要输人目标的身份特征，把病毒放到网上，那这人就是逃脱一死，在社会上也很难生活下去。”\n　　“这个行当已经进化到这种程度了，高！”大史感叹道。\n　　“一个世纪前的软件现在还能运行？”罗辑感到很不可思议。\n　　“可以的，计算机技术早就停止进步了，一个世纪前的软件现在的系统都能兼容。KILLER 病毒在刚出现时杀死了不少人，包括一位国家元首，但后来被杀毒软件和防火墙抑制住了，渐渐消失。可这一版KILLER 是专为攻击罗辑博士编制的，由于目标一直处于冬眠状态，所以它从来没有机会进行显性的动作和表现，一直处于潜伏状态，没有被信息安全系统发现和记录。直到罗辑博士今天在外界出现，KILLER5.2 才激活了自己并完成使命，只是，现在它的创造者已经灭亡了一个世纪。”\n　　“直到一个世纪前，他们还在追杀我？”罗辑说，已经消失的某种思绪又回来了，他极力摆脱了它。\n　　“是的，关键是这个版本的KILLER 病毒是为您专门编制的，从未被激活过，所以才能潜伏到今天。”\n　　“那我们以后怎么办？”大史问。\n　　“正在全系统清理KILLER5.2，但这需要时间，完成之前有两个选择：一是暂时给罗辑博士一个虚假的身份，但这并不能绝对保证安全，还可能造成其他更严重的后果。因为ETO 的软件技术十分高明，KILLER5.2 有可能已经记录了目标更多的特征。一个世纪前曾经有过一个轰动一时的案例：在被保护人使用假身份后，KILLER 进行模糊识别，同时杀死了包括目标在内的上百人；另一个选择是我建议的：你们到地面上去生话一段，在那里，KILLER5.2 没有硬件可以操纵。”\n　　大史说：“同意，即使没有这事，我也想到地面上去。”\n　　“地面上有什么？”罗辑间。\n　　大史解释说：“冬眠苏醒者大部分都生活在地面上，在这里很难适应的。”\n　　“是这样，至少应该去过菠一段时间。”郭警官说，“现代社会的方方面面，政治、经济、文化‘生活习惯和两性关系等等，与两个世纪前相比已经变化很大，我们很难一下子适应的。”\n　　“可你适应得很好。”大史打量着郭警官说，他和罗辑都注意到了他说“我们”。\n　　“我是因自血病冬眠的，苏醒的时候年龄小，才十三岁。”郭正明笑笑说，“不过后来的难处别人也很难体会，仅仅精神治疗我就不知道经历过多少次。”\n　　“在冬眠者中，像你这样真正适应现代生话的人多吗？”罗辑问。\n######################\nOutput:",
