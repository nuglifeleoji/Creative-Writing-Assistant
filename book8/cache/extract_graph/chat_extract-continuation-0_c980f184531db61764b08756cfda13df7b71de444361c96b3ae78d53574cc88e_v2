他们甚至还直接暴露了。而且，没能召唤成功，也意味着，钱磊起不到什么作用了。\n\n    计划中的四对三，立刻就变成了二对三。\n\n    吕千寻的双眸一下就亮了起来，口中发出一声咆哮，身体瞬间变大，一个黄色魂环从脚下升起。\n\n    他的武魂，黄金狮王！\n\n    膨胀成成人大小的壮硕身躯瞬间前冲，悍然撞向石堆，双拳同时轰出。\n\n    叶灵瞳也释放出了自己的武魂天罡龙，天霸体释放，紧随其后。\n\n    他们配合训练已经有三个月了，吕千寻一动，叶灵瞳就知道他要干什么。另一边情况不明，但石块是近在眼前的，他们可以先撞击石块，以石块为武器，压制对方，然后再决定之后的攻击方式。\n\n    而另一边的蓝轩宇在意识到不妙的下一刻，就做出了反应，一拉身边的刘锋，将他的身体向上抛去，右手金纹蓝银草赋予的力量让刘锋直接越过石堆，到了雨道的顶部。而蓝轩宇扔出他之后，立刻改为双手握住巨斧，猛然向上挑起。\n\n    “轰—”\n\n    撞击而来的石块被巨斧硬生生地击飞。空中的刘锋则如同一道白色闪电般瞬间落下，没有攻击最前面的吕千寻和叶灵瞳，而是直接找上了后面的常剑逸。\n\n    刘锋和蓝轩宇都很清楚，二对三，他们的胜算绝对不大，吕千寻可不是等闲之辈，因此他们只能先解决一个再说。刘锋在金纹蓝银草的增幅下，可谓是全力以赴。\n\n    常剑逸只看到一道白光从天而降，白龙枪就已经到了他面前。就在这个时候，常剑逸身上的魂环也爆发了。\n\n    能够成为高能少年班最强三人组的一员，他又岂会普通？在常剑逸背后，一个人偶模样的虚影出现，看上去和他自身有点像，但显得十分僵硬。一层淡淡的白色光晕从人偶身上释放出来，直接覆盖在了常剑逸身上。\n\n    刘锋只觉得自己眼前的一切都变得缓慢了几分。虽然下一瞬间就恢复正常了，但也给了常剑逸时间。\n\n    常剑逸的头勉强避开白龙枪，脚向侧面跨出半步。可下一刻，白龙枪已经从他肩头刺入，直接将他钉在了地面上。\n\n    好疼啊！\n\n    考核中，痛觉被调整到了百分之五，尽管这样，这种贯穿伤带来的疼痛还是不弱，疼得常剑逸眼泪都快流下来了。\n\n    刘锋正准备再补一下，但此时他听到了一声宛如雷鸣般的怒吼。\n\n    “嗷—\n\n
