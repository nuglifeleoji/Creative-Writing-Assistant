around the blind man, studying him, Halleck recalled the stories about him. No stillsuit mask hid the old face in sietch, and the features were there for memory to make its comparisons. Yes, the man did look like the old\nDuke for whom Leto had been named. Was it a chance likeness?\n“You know the stories about this one?” Halleck asked, speaking in an aside to Leto. “That he’s your father come back from the desert?”\n“I’ve heard the stories.”\nHalleck turned to examine the boy. Leto wore an odd stillsuit with rolled edges around his face and ears. A black robe covered it and sandboots sheathed his feet. There was much to be explained about his presence here—how he’d managed to escape once more.\n“Why do you bring The Preacher here?” Halleck asked. “In Jacurutu they said he works for them.”\n“No more. | bring him because Alia wants him dead.”\n“So? You think this is a sanctuary?”\n“You are his sanctuary.”\nAll this time The Preacher stood near them, listening but giving no sign that he cared which turn their discussion took.\n“He has served me well, Gurney,” Leto said. “House Atreides has not lost all sense of obligation to those who serve us.”\n“House Atreides?”\n“lam House Atreides.”\n“You fled Jacurutu before | could complete the testing which your grandmother ordered,” Halleck said, his voice cold. “How can you assume—”\n“This man’s life is to be guarded as though it were your own.” Leto spoke as though there were no argument and he met Halleck’s stare without flinching.\nJessica had trained Halleck in many of the Bene Gesserit refinements of observation and he’d detected nothing in Leto which spoke of other than calm assurance. Jessica’s orders remained, though. “Your grandmother charged me to complete your education and be sure you’re not possessed.”\n“I’m not possessed.” Just a flat statement.\n“Why did you run away?”\n“Namri had orders to kill me no matter what | did. His orders were from Alia.”\n“Are you a Truthsayer, then?”\n“Tam.” Another flat statement filled with self-assurance.\n“And Ghanima as well?”\n“No.”\nThe Preacher broke his silence then, turning his blind sockets toward Halleck but pointing at Leto. “You think you can test him?”\n“Don’t interfere when you know nothing of the problem or its consequences,” Halleck ordered, not looking at the man.\n“Oh, | Know its consequences well enough,” The Preacher said. “I was tested once by an old woman who thought she knew what she was doing. She didn’t know, as it turned out.”\nHalleck looked at him then. “You’re another Truthsayer?” “Anyone can be a Truthsayer, even you,” The Preacher said. “It’s a matter of self-honesty about the nature of your own feelings. It requires that you have an inner agreement\nwith truth which allows ready recognition.”\n“Why do you interfere?” Halleck asked, putting hand to crysknife. Who was this Preacher?\n“I’m responsive to these events,” The Preacher said. “My mother could put her own blood upon the altar, but | have other motives. And | do see your problem.”\n“Oh?” Halleck was actually curious now.\n“The Lady Jessica ordered you to differentiate between the wolf and the dog, between ze’eb and ke’/eb. By her definition a wolf is someone with power who misuses that power. However, between wolf and dog there is a dawn period when you cannot distinguish between them.”\n“That’s close to the mark,” Halleck said, noting how more and more people of the sietch had entered the common room to listen. “How do you know this?”\n“Because | know this planet. You don’t understand? Think how it is. Beneath the surface there are rocks, dirt, sediment, sand. That’s the planet’s memory, the picture of its history. It’s the same with humans. The dog remembers the wolf. Each universe revolves around a core of being, and outward from that core go all of the memories, right out to the surface.”\n“Very interesting,” Halleck said. “How does that help me carry out my orders?”\n“Review the picture of your history which is within you. Communicate as animals would communicate.”\nHalleck shook his head. There was a compelling directness about this Preacher, a quality which he’d recognized many times in the Atreides, and there was more than a little hint that the man was employing the powers of Voice. Halleck felt his heart begin to hammer. Was it possible?\n“Jessica wanted an ultimate test, a stress by which the underlying fabric of her grandson exposed itself,” The Preacher said. “But the fabric’s always there, open to your gaze.”\nHalleck turned to stare at Leto. The movement came of itself, compelled by irresistible forces.\nThe Preacher continued as though lecturing an obstinate pupil. “This young person confuses you because he’s not a singular being. He’s a community. As with any community under stress, any member of that community may assume command. This command isn’t always benign, and we get our stories of Abomination. But you’ve already wounded this community enough, Gurney Halleck. Can’t you see that the transformation already has taken place? This youth has achieved an inner cooperation which is enormously powerful, that cannot be subverted. Without eyes | see this. Once | opposed him, but now | do his bidding. He is the Healer.”\n“Who are you?” Halleck demanded.\n“I’m no more than what you see. Don’t look at me, look at this person you were ordered to teach and test. He has been formed by crisis. He survived a lethal environment. He is here.”\n“Who are you?” Halleck insisted.\n“| tell you only to look at this Atreides youth! He is the ultimate feedback upon which our species depends. He'll reinsert into the system the results of its past performance. No other human could know that past performance as he knows it. And you consider destroying such a one!”\n“I was ordered to test him and I’ve not—”\n“But you have!”\n“Is he Abomination?”\nA weary laugh shook The Preacher. “You persist in Bene Gesserit nonsense. How they create the myths by which men sleep!”\n“Are you Paul Atreides?” Halleck asked.\n“Paul Atreides is no more. He tried to stand as a supreme moral symbol while he renounced all moral pretensions. He became a saint without a god, every word a blasphemy. How can you think—”\n“Because you speak with his voice.”\n“Would you test me, now? Beware, Gurney Halleck.”\nHalleck swallowed, forced his attention back to the impassive Leto who still stood calmly observant. “Who’s being tested?” The Preacher asked. “Is it, perhaps, that the Lady Jessica tests you, Gurney Halleck?”\nHalleck found this thought deeply disturbing, wondering why he let this Preacher’s words move him. But it was a deep thing in Atreides servants to obey that autocratic mystique. Jessica, explaining this, had made it even more mysterious. Halleck now felt something changing within himself, a something whose edges had only been touched by the Bene Gesserit training Jessica had pressed upon him. Inarticulate fury arose in him. He did not want to change!\n“Which of you plays God and to what end?” The Preacher asked. “You cannot rely on reason alone to answer that question.”\nSlowly, deliberately, Halleck raised his attention from Leto to the blind man. Jessica kept saying he should achieve the balance of kairits—“thou shalt-thou shalt not.” She called it a discipline without words and phrases, no rules or arguments. It was the sharpened edge of his own internal truth, all-engrossing. Something in the blind man’s voice, his tone, his manner, ignited a fury which burned itself into blinding calmness within Halleck.\n“Answer my question,” The Preacher said.\nHalleck felt the words deepen his concentration upon this place, this one moment and its demands. His position in the universe was defined only by his concentration. No doubt remained in him. This was Paul Atreides, not dead, but returned. And this non-child, Leto. Halleck looked once more at Leto, really saw him. He saw the signs of stress around the eyes, the sense of balance in the stance, the passive mouth with its quirking sense of humor. Leto stood out from his background as though at the focus of a blinding light. He had achieved harmony simply by accepting it.\n“Tell me, Paul,” Halleck said. “Does your mother know?”\nThe Preacher sighed. “To the Sisterhood, all achieved harmony simply by accepting it.\n“Tell me, Paul,” Halleck said. “Does your mother know?”\nThe Preacher sighed. “To the Sisterhood, all of it, | am dead. Do not try to revive me.”\nStill not looking at him, Halleck asked: “But why does she\n“She does what she must. She makes her own life, thinking she rules many lives. Thus we all play god.”\n“But you're alive,” Halleck whispered, overcome now by his realization, turning at last to stare at this man, younger than himself, but so aged by the desert that he appeared to carry twice Halleck’s years.\n“What is that?” Paul demanded. “Alive?”\nHalleck peered around them at the watching Fremen, their faces caught between doubt and awe.\n“My mother never had to learn my lesson.” It was Paul’s voice! “To be a god can ultimately become boring and degrading. There’d be reason enough for the invention of free will! A god might wish to escape into sleep and be alive only in the unconscious projections of his dream-creatures.”\n“But you're alive!” Halleck spoke louder now.\nPaul ignored the excitement in his old companion’s voice, asked: “Would you really have pitted this lad against his sister in the test-Mashhad? What deadly nonsense! Each would have said: ‘No! Kill me! Let the other live!’ Where would such a test lead? What is it then to be alive, Gurney?”\n“That was not the test,” Halleck protested. He did not like the way the Fremen pressed closer around them, studying Paul, ignoring Leto.\nBut Leto intruded now. “Look at the fabric, father.”\n“Yes...yes...” Paul held his head high as though sniffing the air. “It’s Farad’n, then!”\n“How easy it is to follow our thoughts instead of our senses,” Leto said.\nHalleck had been unable to follow this thought and, about to ask, was interrupted by Leto’s hand upon his arm. “Don’t ask, Gurney. You might return to suspecting that I’m Abomination. No! Let it happen, Gurney. If you try to force it, you'll only destroy yourself.”\nBut Halleck felt himself overcome by doubts. Jessica had warned him. “They can be very beguiling, these pre-born. They have tricks you’ve never even dreamed.” Halleck shook his head slowly. And Paul! Gods below! Paul alive and in league with this question mark he’d fathered!\nThe Fremen around them could no longer be held back. They pressed between Halleck and Paul, between Let", "...” Paul held his head high as though sniffing the air. “It’s Farad’n, then!”\n“How easy it is to follow our thoughts instead of our senses,” Leto said.\nHalleck had been unable to follow this thought and, about to ask, was interrupted by Leto’s hand upon his arm. “Don’t ask, Gurney. You might return to suspecting that I’m Abomination. No! Let it happen, Gurney. If you try to force it, you'll only destroy yourself.”\nBut Halleck felt himself overcome by doubts. Jessica had warned him. “They can be very beguiling, these pre-born. They have tricks you’ve never even dreamed.” Halleck shook his head slowly. And Paul! Gods below! Paul alive and in league with this question mark he’d fathered!\nThe Fremen around them could no longer be held back. They pressed between Halleck and Paul, between Leto and Paul, shoving the two to the background. The air was\nshowered with hoarse questions. “Are you Muab’Dib? Are you truly Muad’Dib? Is it true, what he says? Tell us!”\n“You must think of me only as The Preacher,” Paul said, pushing against them. “I cannot be Paul Atreides or Muad’Dib, never again. I’m not Chani’s mate or Emperor.’\nHalleck, fearing what might happen if these frustrated questions found no logical answer, was about to act when Leto moved ahead of him. It was there Halleck first saw an element of the terrible change which had been wrought in Leto. A bull voice roared, “Stand aside!”—and Leto moved forward, thrusting adult Fremen right and left, knocking them down, clubbing them with his hands, wrenching knives from their hands by grasping the blades.\nIn less than a minute those Fremen still standing were pressed back against the walls in silent consternation. Leto stood beside his father. “When Shai-Hulud speaks, you obey,” Leto said.\nAnd when a few of the Fremen had started to argue, Leto had torn a corner of rock from the passage wall beside the room’s exit and crumbled it in his bare hands, smiling all the while.\n“I will tear your sietch down around your faces,” he said.\n“The Desert Demon,” someone whispered.\n“And your qanats,” Leto agreed. “I will rip them apart. We have not been here, do you hear me?”\nHeads shook from side to side in terrified submission.\n“No one here has seen us,” Leto said. “One whisper from you and | will return to drive you into the desert without water.”\nHalleck saw hands being raised in the warding gesture, the sign of the worm.\n“We will go now, my father and I, accompanied by our old friend,” Leto said. “Make our ‘thopter ready.”\nAnd Leto had guided them to Shuloch then, explaining en route that they must move swiftly because “Farad’n will be\nA\nhere on Arrakis very soon. And, as my father has said, then you'll see the real test, Gurney.”\nLooking down from the Shuloch butte, Halleck asked himself once more, as he asked every day: “What test? What does he mean?”\nBut Leto was no longer in Shuloch, and Paul refused to answer.\nChurch and State, scientific reason and faith, the individual and his community, even progress and tradition—all of these can be reconciled in the teachings of Muad’Dib. He taught us that there exist no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men. Anyone can rip aside the veil of Time. You can discover the future in the past or in your own imagination. Doing this, you win back your consciousness in your inner being. You know then that the universe is a coherent whole and you are indivisible from it.\n—THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\nhanima sat far back outside the circle of light from the\nspice lamps and watched this Buer Agarves. She didn’t like his round face and agitated eyebrows, his way of moving his feet when he spoke, as though his words were a hidden music to which he danced.\nHe’s not here to parley with Stil, Ghanima told herself, seeing this confirmed in every word and movement from this man. She moved farther back away from the Council circle.\nEvery sietch had a room such as this one, but the meeting hall of the abandoned djedida struck Ghanima as a cramped place because it was so low. Sixty people from Stilgar’s band plus the nine who'd come with Agarves filled only one end of the hall. Spice-oil lamps reflected against low beams which supported the ceiling. The light cast wavering shadows which danced on the walls, and the pungent smoke filled the place with the smell of cinnamon.\nThe meeting had started at dusk after the moisture prayers and evening meal. It had been going on for more than an hour now, and Ghanima couldn’t fathom the hidden currents in Agarves’s performance. His words appeared\nclear enough, but his motions and eye movements didn’t agree.\nAgarves was speaking now, responding to a question from one of Stilgar’s lieutenants, a niece of Harah’s named Rajia. She was a darkly ascetic young woman whose mouth turned down at the corners, giving her an air of perpetual distrust. Ghanima found the expression satisfying in the circumstances.\n“Certainly | believe Alia will grant a full and complete pardon to all of you,” Agarves said. “I’d not be here with this message otherwise.”\nStilgar intervened as Rajia made to speak once more. “I’m not so much worried about our trusting her as | am about whether she trusts you.” Stilgar’s voice carried growling undertones. He was uncomfortable with this suggestion that he return to his old status.\n“It doesn’t matter whether she trusts me,” Agarves said. “To be candid about it, | don’t believe she does. I’ve been too long searching for you without finding you. But I’ve always felt she didn’t really want you captured. She was—”\n“She was the wife of the man | slew,” Stilgar said. “I grant you that he asked for it. Might just as well’ve fallen on his own knife. But this new attitude smells of—”\nAgarves danced to his feet, anger plain on his face. “She forgives you! How many times must I say it? She had the Priests make a great show of asking divine guidance from—’\n“You've only raised another issue.” It was Irulan, leaning forward past Rajia, blonde head set off against Rajia’s darkness. “She has convinced you, but she may have other plans.”\n“The Priesthood has—”\n“But there are all of these stories,” Irulan said. “That you're more than just a military advisor, that you’re her—”\n“Enough!” Agarves was beside himself with rage. His hand hovered near his knife. Warring emotions moved just below the surface of his skin, twisting his features. “Believe\nA\nwhat you will, but | cannot go on with that woman! She fouls me! She dirties everything she touches! | am used. | am soiled. But | have not lifted my knife against my kin. Now— no more!”\nGhanima, observing this, thought: That, at least, was truth coming out of him.\nSurprisingly, Stilgar broke into laughter. “Ahhhh, cousin,” he said. “Forgive me, but there’s truth in anger.”\n“Then you agree?”\n“I’ve not said that.” He raised a hand as Agarves threatened another outburst. “It’s not for my sake, Buer, but there are these others.” He gestured around him. “They are my responsibility. Let us consider for a moment what reparations Alia offers.”\n“Reparations? There’s no word of reparations. Pardon, but no—”\n“Then what does she offer as surety of her word?”\n“Sietch Tabr and you as Naib, full autonomy as a neutral. She understands now how—”\n“I'll not go back to her entourage or provide her with fighting men,” Stilgar warned. “Is that understood?”\nGhanima could hear Stilgar beginning to weaken and thought: No, Stil! No!\n“No need for that,” Agarves said. “Alia wants only Ghanima returned to her and the carrying out of the betrothal promise which she—”\n“So now it comes out!” Stilgar said, his brows drawing down. “Ghanima’s the price of my pardon. Does she think me—”\n“She thinks you sensible,” Agarves argued, resuming his seat.\nGleefully, Ghanima thought: He won't do it. Save your breath. He won't do it.\nAs she thought this, Ghanima heard a soft rustling behind and to her left. She started to turn, felt powerful hands grab her. A heavy rag reeking of sleep-drugs covered her face\nbefore she could cry out. As consciousness faded, she felt herself being carried toward a door in the hall’s darkest reaches. And she thought: / should have guessed! | should’ve been prepared! But the hands that held her were adult and strong. She could not squirm away from them.\nGhanima’s last sensory impressions were of cold air, a glimpse of stars, and a hooded face which looked down at her, then asked: “She wasn’t injured, was she?”\nThe answer was lost as the stars wheeled and streaked across her gaze, losing themselves in a blaze of light which was the inner core of her selfdom.\nMuad’Dib gave us a particular kind of knowledge about prophetic insight, about the behavior which surrounds such insight and its influence upon events which are seen to be “on line.” (That is, events which are set to occur in a related system which the prophet reveals and interprets.) As has been noted elsewhere, such insight operates as a peculiar trap for the prophet himself. He can become the victim of what he knows—which is a relatively common human failing. The danger is that those who predict real events may overlook the polarizing effect brought about by overindulgence in their own truth. They tend to forget that nothing in a polarized universe can exist without its opposite being present.\n—THE PRESCIENT VISION BY HARQ AL-ADA\nlowing sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring the\nrising sun. The sand was cold in the dune shadows. Leto stood outside the ring of the palmyrie looking into the desert. He smelled dust and the aroma of spiny plants, heard the morning sounds of people and animals. The Fremen maintained no qanat in this place. They had only a bare minimum of hand planting irrigated by the women, who carried water in skin bags. Their windtrap was a fragile thing, easily destroyed by the stormwinds but easily rebuilt. Hardship, the rigors of the spice trade, and adventure were a way of life here. These Fremen still believed heaven was the sound of running water, but they cherished an ancient concept of Freedom which Leto shared.\nFreedom is a lonely state, he thought.\nLeto adjusted the folds of the white robe which covered his living stillsuit.

He could feel how the sandtrout membrane had changed him and, as always with this feeling, he was forced to overcome a deep sense of loss. He no longer was completely human. Odd things swam in his blood. Sandtrout cilia had penetrated every organ,\nadjusting, changing. The sandtrout itself was changing, adapting. But Leto, knowing this, felt himself torn by the old threads of his lost humanity, his life caught in primal anguish with its ancient continuity shattered. He knew the trap of indulging in such emotion, though. He knew it well.\nLet the future happen of itself, he thought. The only rule governing creativity is the act of creation itself.\nIt was difficult to take his gaze away from the sands, the dunes—the great emptiness. Here at the edge of the sand lay a few rocks, but they led the imagination outward into the winds, the dust, the sparse and lonely plants and animals, dune merging into dune, desert into desert.\nBehind him came the sound of a flute playing for the morning prayer, the chant for moisture which now was a subtly altered serenade to the new Shai-Hulud. This knowledge in Leto’s mind gave the music a sense of eternal loneliness.\n| could just walk away into that desert, he thought.\nEverything would change then. One direction would be as good as another. He had already learned to live a life free of possessions. He had refined the Fremen mystique to a terrible edge: everything he took with him was necessary, and that was all he took. But he carried nothing except the robe on his back, the Atreides hawk ring hidden in its folds, and the skin-which-was-not-his-own.\nIt would be easy to walk away from here.\nMovement high in the sky caught his attention: the splayed-gap wingtips identified a vulture. The sight filled his chest with aching. Like the wild Fremen, vultures lived in this land because this was where they were born. They knew nothing better. The desert made them what they were.\nAnother Fremen breed was coming up in the wake of Muad’Dib and Alia, though. They were the reason he could not let himself walk away into the desert as his father had done. Leto recalled Idaho’s words from the early days:\n“These Fremen! They're magnificently alive. I’ve never met a greedy Fremen.”\nThere were plenty of greedy Fremen now.\nA wave of sadness passed over Leto. He was committed to a course which could change all of that, but at a terrible price. And the management of that course became increasingly difficult as they neared the vortex.\nKralizec, the Typhoon Struggle, lay ahead . . . but Kralizec or worse would be the price of a misstep.\nVoices sounded behind Leto, then the clear piping sound of a child speaking: “Here he is.”\nLeto turned.\nThe Preacher had come out of the palmyrie, led by a child.\nWhy do I still think of him as The Preacher? Leto wondered.\nThe answer lay there on the clean tablet of Leto’s mind: Because this is no longer Muad’Dib, no longer Paul Atreides. The desert had made him what he was. The desert and the jackals of Jacurutu with their overdoses of melange and their constant betrayals. The Preacher was old before his time, old not despite the spice but because of it.\n“They said you wanted to see me now,” The Preacher said, speaking as his child guide stopped.\nLeto looked at the child of the palmyrie, a person almost as tall as himself, with awe tempered by an avaricious curiosity. The young eyes glinted darkly above the child- sized stillsuit mask.\nLeto waved a hand. “Leave us.”\nFor a moment there was rebellion in the child’s shoulders, then the awe and native Fremen respect for privacy took over. The child left them.\n“You know Farad’n is here on Arrakis?” Leto asked.\n“Gurney told me when he flew me down last night.”\nAnd The Preacher thought: How coldly measured his words are. He’s like | was in the old days.\n“| face a difficult choice,” Leto said.\n“I thought you'd already made all the choices.”\n“We know that trap, father.”\nThe Preacher cleared his throat. The tensions told him how near they were to the shattering crisis. Now Leto would not be relying on pure vision, but on vision management.\n“You need my help?” The Preacher asked.\n“Yes. I’m returning to Arrakeen and | wish to go as your guide.”\n“To what end?”\n“Would you preach once more in Arrakeen?”\n“Perhaps. There are things I’ve not said to them.”\n“You will not come back to the desert, father.”\n“If | go with you?”\n“Yes.”\n“VIL do whatever you decide.”\n“Have you considered? With Farad’n there, your mother will be with him.”\n“Undoubtedly.”\nOnce more, The Preacher cleared his throat. It was a betrayal of nervousness which Muad’Dib would never have permitted. This flesh had been too long away from the old regimen of self-discipline, his mind too often betrayed into madness by the Jacurutu. And The Preacher thought that perhaps it wouldn’t be wise to return to Arrakeen.\n“You don’t have to go back there with me,” Leto said. “But my sister is there and | must return. You could go with Gurney.”\n“And you’d go to Arrakeen alone?”\n“Yes. | must meet Farad’n.”\n“I will go with you,” The Preacher sighed.\nAnd Leto sensed a touch of the old vision madness in The Preacher’s manner, wondered: Has he been playing the prescience game? No. He’d never go that way again. He knew the trap of a partial commitment. The Preacher’s every word confirmed that he had handed over the visions\nto his son, knowing that everything in this universe had been anticipated.\nIt was the old polarities which taunted The Preacher now. He had fled from paradox into paradox.\n“We'll be leaving in a few minutes, then,” Leto said. “Will you tell Gurney?”\n“Gurney’s not going with us?”\n“I want Gurney to survive.”\nThe Preacher opened himself to the tensions then. They were in the air around him, in the ground under his feet, a motile thing which focused onto the non-child who was his son. The blunt scream of his old visions waited in The Preacher's throat.\nThis cursed holiness!\nThe sandy juice of his fears could not be avoided. He knew what faced them in Arrakeen. They would play a game once more with terrifying and deadly forces which could never bring them peace.\nThe child who refuses to travel in the father’s harness, this is the symbol of man’s most unique capability. “I do not have to be what my father was. | do not have to obey my father’s rules or even believe everything he believed. It is my strength as a human that | can make my own choices of what to believe and what not to believe, of what to be and what not to be.”\n—LETO ATREIDES II THE HARQ AL-ADA BIOGRAPHY\nP ilgrim women were dancing to drum and flute in the Temple plaza, no coverings on their heads, bangles at their necks, their dresses thin and revealing. Their long black hair was thrown straight out, then straggled across their faces as they whirled.\nAlia looked down at the scene from her Temple aerie, both attracted and repelled. It was mid-morning, the hour when the aroma of spice-coffee began to waft across the plaza from the vendors beneath the shaded arches. Soon she would have to go out and greet Farad’n, present the formal gifts and supervise his first meeting with Ghanima.\nIt was all working out according to plan. Ghani would kill him and, in the shattering aftermath, only one person would be prepared to pick up the pieces. The puppets danced when the strings were pulled. Stilgar had killed Agarves just as she’d hoped. And Agarves had led the kidnappers to the djedida without knowing it, a secret signal transmitter hidden in the new boots she’d given him. Now Stilgar and lrulan waited in the Temple dungeons. Perhaps they would die, but there might be other uses for them. There was no harm in waiting.\nShe noted that two Fremen were watching the pilgrim dancers below her, their eyes intense and unwavering. A\nbasic sexual equality had come out of the desert to persist in Fremen town and city, but social differences between male and female already were making themselves felt. That, too, went according to plan. Divide and weaken. Alia could sense the subtle change in the way the two Fremen watched those off-planet women and their exotic dance.\nLet them watch. Let them fill their minds with ghafla.\nThe louvers of Alia’s window had been opened and she could feel a sharp increase in the heat which began about sunrise in this season and would peak in mid- afternoon. The temperature on the stone floor of the plaza would be much higher. It would be uncomfortable for those dancers, but still they whirled and bent, swung their arms and their hair in the frenzy of their dedication. They had dedicated their dance to Alia, the Womb of Heaven. An aide had come to whisper this to Alia, sneering at the off-world women and their peculiar ways. The aide had explained that the women were from Ix, where remnants of the forbidden science and technology remained.\nAlia sniffed. Those women were as ignorant, as superstitious and backward as the desert Fremen... just as that sneering aide had said, trying to curry favor by reporting the dedication of the dance. And neither the aide nor the Ixians even knew that Ix was merely a number in a forgotten language.\nLaughing lightly to herself, Alia thought: Let them dance. The dancing wasted energy which might be put to more destructive uses. And the music was pleasant, a thin wailing played against flat tympani from gourd drums and clapped hands.\nAbruptly the music was drowned beneath a roaring of many voices from the plaza’s far side. The dancers missed a step, recovered in a brief confusion, but they had lost their sensuous singleness, and even their attention wandered to the far gate of the plaza, where a mob could be seen\nspreading onto the stones like water rushing through the opened valve of a qanat.\nAlia stared at that oncoming wave.\nShe heard words now, and one above all others: “Preacher! Preacher!”\nThen she saw him, striding with the first spread of the wave, one hand on the shoulder of his young guide.\nThe pilgrim dancers gave up their whirling, retired to the terraced steps below Alia. They were joined by their audience, and Alia sensed awe in the watchers.
