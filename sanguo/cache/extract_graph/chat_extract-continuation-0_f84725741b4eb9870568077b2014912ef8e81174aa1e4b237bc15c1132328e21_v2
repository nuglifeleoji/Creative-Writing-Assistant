�是二人卧于草畔。庄主问曰：“二少年谁家之子？”帝不敢应。陈留王指帝曰：“此是当今皇帝，遭十常侍之乱，逃难到此。吾乃皇弟陈留王也。”庄主大惊，再拜曰：“臣先朝司徒崔烈之弟崔毅也。因见十常侍卖官嫉贤，故隐于此。”遂扶帝入庄，跪进酒食。却说闵贡赶上段珪，拿住问：“天子何在？”珪言：“已在半路相失，不知何往。”贡遂杀段珪，悬头于马项下，分兵四散寻觅；自己却独乘一马。随路追寻，偶至崔毅庄，毅见首级，问之，贡说详细，崔毅引贡见帝，君臣痛哭。贡曰：“国不可一日无君，请陛下还都。”崔毅庄上止有瘦马一匹，备与帝乘。贡与陈留王共乘一马。离庄而行，不到三里，司徒王允，太尉杨彪、左军校尉淳于琼、右军校尉赵萌、后军校尉鲍信、中军校尉袁绍，一行人众，数百人马，接着车驾。君臣皆哭。先使人将段珪首级往京师号令，另换好马与帝及陈留王骑坐，簇帝还京。先是洛阳小儿谣曰：“帝非帝，王非王，千乘万骑走北邙。”至此果应其谶。\n\n    车驾行不到数里，忽见旌旗蔽日，尘土遮天，一枝人马到来。百官失色，帝亦大惊。袁绍骤马出问：“何人？”绣旗影里，一将飞出，厉声问：“天子何在？”帝战栗不能言。陈留王勒马向前，叱曰：“来者何人？”卓曰：“西凉刺史董卓也。”陈留王曰：“汝来保驾耶，汝来劫驾耶？”卓应曰：“特来保驾。”陈留王曰：“既来保驾，天子在此，何不下马？”卓大惊，慌忙下马，拜于道左。陈留王以言抚慰董卓，自初至终，并无失语。卓暗奇之，已怀废立之意。是日还宫，见何太后，俱各痛哭。检点宫中，不见了传国玉玺。\n\n    董卓屯兵城外，每日带铁甲马军入城，横行街市，百姓惶惶不安。卓出入宫庭，略无忌惮。后军校尉鲍信，来见袁绍，言董卓必有异心，可速除之。绍曰：“朝廷新定，未可轻动。”鲍信见王允，亦言其事。允曰：“且容商议。”信自引本部军兵，投泰山去了。董卓招诱何进兄弟部下之兵，尽归掌握。私谓李儒曰：“吾欲废帝立陈留王，何如？”李儒曰：“今朝廷无主，不就此时行事，迟则有变矣。来日于温明园中，召集百官，谕以废立；有不从者斩之，则威权之行，正在今日。”卓喜。次日大排筵会\n######################\nOutput:",
