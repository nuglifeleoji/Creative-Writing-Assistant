�营中。郭汜领兵入官，尽抢掳宫嫔采女入营，放火烧宫殿。次日，郭汜知李傕劫了天子，领军来营前厮杀。帝后都受惊恐。后人有诗叹之曰：“光武中兴兴汉世，上下相承十二帝。桓灵无道宗社堕，阉臣擅权为叔季。无谋何进作三公，欲除社鼠招奸雄。豺獭虽驱虎狼入，西州逆竖生淫凶。王允赤心托红粉，致令董吕成矛盾。渠魁殄灭天下宁，谁知李郭心怀愤。神州荆棘争奈何，六宫饥馑愁干戈。人心既离天命去，英雄割据分山河。后王规此存兢业，莫把金瓯等闲缺。生灵糜烂肝脑涂，剩水残山多怨血。我观遗史不胜悲，今古茫茫叹黍离。人君当守苞桑戒，太阿谁执全纲维。\n\n    却说郭汜兵到，李傕出营接战。汜军不利，暂且退去。傕乃移帝后车驾于郿坞，使侄李暹监之，断绝内使，饮食不继，侍臣皆有饥色。帝令人问傕取米五斛，牛骨五具，以赐左右。傕怒曰：“朝夕上饭，何又他求？”乃以腐肉朽粮与之，皆臭不可食。帝骂曰：“逆贼直如此相欺！”侍中杨琦急奏曰：“傕性残暴。事势至此，陛下且忍之，不可撄其锋也。”帝乃低头无语，泪盈袍袖。忽左右报曰：“有一路军马，枪刀映日，金鼓震天，前来救驾。”帝教打听是谁，乃郭汜也。帝心转忧。只闻坞外喊声大起，原来李傕引兵出迎郭汜，鞭指郭汜而骂曰：“我待你不薄，你如何谋害我！”汜曰：“尔乃反贼，如何不杀你！”傕曰：“我保驾在此，何为反贼？”汜曰：“此乃劫驾，何为保驾？”傕曰：“不须多言！我两个各不许用军士，只自并输赢。赢的便把皇帝取去罢了。”二人便就阵前厮杀。战到十合。不分胜负。只见杨彪拍马而来，大叫：“二位将军少歇！老夫特邀众官，来与二位讲和。”傕、汜乃各自还营。\n\n    杨彪与朱儁会合朝廷官僚六十余人，先诣郭汜营中劝和。郭汜竟将众官尽行监下。众官曰：“我等为好而来，何乃如此相待？”汜曰：“李傕劫天子，偏我劫不得公卿！”杨彪曰：“一劫天子，一劫公卿，意欲何为？”汜大怒，便拔剑欲杀彪。中郎将杨密力劝，汜乃放了杨彪、朱儁，其余都监在营中。彪谓儁曰：“为社稷之臣，不能匡君\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
