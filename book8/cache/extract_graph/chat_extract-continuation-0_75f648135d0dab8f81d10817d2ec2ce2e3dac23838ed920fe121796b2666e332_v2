“轩宇，有个事儿老师要告诉你一下。这次假期你也可以好好做准备。”秋雨馨低声说道。\n\n    “什么事啊？”蓝轩宇好奇的问道。\n------------\n\n第五十九章 高能少年班\n\n    秋雨馨微微一笑，“当然是好事了。我得到消息，下个学期，咱们天罗学院本院将会开办高能少年班。将会在所有附属学院之中选拔最优秀的人才加入。”\n\n    蓝轩宇惊讶的道：“高能少年班是什么？”\n\n    秋雨馨道：“就是选择一些品学兼优又有潜质的学生组成一个特殊的班级，这个班级将不会按照教学大纲教学，而是会超前教学。全部由本院最优秀的老师来教导。所以也可以称之为天才班。天才班的招生标准是十岁以下，由各分院推荐。咱们学院一、二、三年级都有机会报名。你这不才八岁么。刚好也合适。考核会按照综合素质来进行。要是考进去，几乎就注定了未来可以报送高级魂师学院，而且还有年龄上的优势，未来不可限量。所以，这个假期你一定不能懈怠，要好好修炼。到时候充分展现出自身的综合素质。一旦被录取了，那可就了不得了，老师都要羡慕了。”\n\n    “高能少年班！谢谢秋老师，那我可以告诉我妈妈吗？”蓝轩宇问道。\n\n    “那当然是可以的。还需要她帮你多做准备。反正你记住，自身条件越好，就越有机会。咱们学院一共只有十个参加考核的名额，反正咱们班我报了你。加油哦！”\n\n    “谢谢秋老师，我一定努力。”蓝轩宇用力的点了点头。\n\n    他虽然还是个孩子，可经历了一些事情之后，这半年来他的成长速度明显要比以前快得多。至少他找到了一些努力修炼的意义。无论是娜娜老师，还是保护妈妈，都在他心中留下了很深刻的印象。\n\n    秋雨馨欣慰的点了点头，“好，那你快回去吧。”\n\n    走出一年级一班教室，蓝轩宇脑海中还回味着高能少年班这几个字。可才一出教师门，一个声音却在他耳边响起。\n\n    “蓝轩宇。”\n\n    听到有人叫他，蓝轩宇赶忙回身看去。他惊讶的看到，叫自己的不是别人，正是那曾经不止一次想要欺负自己，又十分强势的叶灵瞳。\n\n    “叶灵瞳？你回来了？”蓝轩宇惊讶的看着她。\n\n    叶灵瞳贝齿轻咬红唇，看着蓝轩宇点了点头。\n\n    和几个月前相比，她的俏脸看上去多了一抹苍白，眼神似乎也不像之前那么明亮了。\n\n    “我是来找你的。”叶灵瞳走到蓝轩宇面前。\n\n    “找我干什么？”蓝轩宇有些好奇的问道。\n\n    叶灵瞳抿了抿红唇，“我是来告诉你，我一定会找到击败你的�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>天罗学院<|>ORGANIZATION<|>天罗学院 is an educational
