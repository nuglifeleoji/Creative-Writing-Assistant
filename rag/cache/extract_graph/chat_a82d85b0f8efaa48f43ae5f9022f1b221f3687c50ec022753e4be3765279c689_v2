She focused on the words: “He gives moisture to the dead.” It was a gift to the shadow world—tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.\nNothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate value of water. Not the water- sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a Substance more precious than all others—it was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism and ritual.\nWater.\n“I touched his cheek,” someone whispered. “I felt the gift.”\nAt first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul. He clutched the cold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm. Then he saw the faces beyond the groping hands—the eyes wide and wondering.\nPresently, the hands withdrew. The funeral ceremony resumed. But now there was a subtle Space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop honored him by a respectful isolation.\nThe ceremony ended with a low chant:\n“Full moon calls thee—\nShai-hulud shalt thou see;\nRed the night, dusky sky,\nBloody death didst thou die.\nWe pray to a moon: she is round—\nLuck with us will then abound, What we seek for shall be found In the land of solid ground.”\nA bulging sack remained at Stilgar’s feet. He crouched, placed his palms against it. Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul recognized Chani’s face in the hood shadow.\n“Jamis carried thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms of the tribe’s water,” Chani said. “I bless it now in the presence of a Sayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water, fillissin- follasy of Paul-Muad’Dib! Kivi a-kavi, never the more, nakalas! Nakelas! to be measured and counted, ukair- an! by the heartbeats jan-jan-jan of our friend... Jamis.”\nIn an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, Stared at Paul. Presently she said: “Where | am flame be thou the coals. Where | am dew be thou the water.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.\n“To Paul-Muad’Dib goes this portion,” Chani said. “May he guard it for the tribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with it in time of need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.\nI must accept that water, Paul thought. Slowly, he arose, made his way to Chani’s side. Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently from his hand.\n“Kneel,” Chani said.\nPaul knelt.\nShe guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient surface. “With this water the tribe entrusts thee,” she said. “Jamis is gone from it. Take it in peace.” She stood, pulling Paul up with her.\nStilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in one palm. Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the light of the glowglobe reflected off them.\nChani took the largest ring, held it on a finger. “Thirty liters,” she said. One by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them. “Two liters; one liter; seven watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of three-thirty-seconds drachms. In all—thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.”\nShe held them up on her finger for Paul to see.\n“Do you accept them?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul swallowed, nodded. “Yes.”\n“Later,” Chani said, “I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they won't rattle and give you away when you need silence.” She extended her hand.\n“Will you...hold them for me?” Paul asked.\nChani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.\nHe smiled, said, “Paul-Muad’Dib who is Usul does not yet know our ways, Chani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it’s time to show him the manner of carrying them.”\nShe nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the rings onto it with an\nintricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then stuffed them into the sash beneath her robe.\nI missed something there, Paul thought. He sensed the feeling of humor around him, something bantering in it, and his mind linked up a prescient memory: watercounters offered to a woman— courtship ritual.\n“Watermasters,” Stilgar said.\nThe troop arose in a hissing of robes. Two men stepped out, lifted the waterbag. Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the depths of the cave.\nPaul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over rock walls, the way the shadows danced, and he felt the troop’s lift of spirits contained in a hushed air of expectancy.\nJessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around by jostling bodies, Suppressed a moment of panic. She had recognized fragments of the ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani Jib in the words, and she knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple moments.\nJan-jan-jan, she thought. Go-go-go.\nIt was like a child’s game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.\nStilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall. He pressed an outcropping and the wall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack. He led the way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air across Paul when he passed it.\nPaul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. “That air felt damp,” he said.\n“Sh-h-h-h,” she whispered.\nBut a man behind them said: “Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight. Jamis’ way of telling us he’s satisfied.”\nJessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind. She saw how the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the air as she came opposite it.\nWindtrap! she thought. They’ve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface to funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from it.\nThey passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the door closed behind them. The draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of moisture clearly perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.\nAt the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgar’s hands dropped below the level of the heads in front of Paul. Presently he felt steps beneath his feet, curving down to the left. Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps.\nJessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.\nThe steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light of the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling.\nPaul felt Chani’s hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill air, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of water.\n| have seen this place in a dream, he thought.\nThe thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him on this path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his name. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror. Wild legions would charge into battle screaming their war cry: “Muad’Dib!”\nIt must not be, he thought. / cannot let it happen.\nBut he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut. It was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this instant, the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and now— himself and his mother included—could stop the thing.\nPaul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed him forward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the barrier in the glow of Stilgar’s globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water. It stretched away into shadows— deep and black—the far wall only faintly visible, perhaps a hundred meters away.\nJessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its\ndeepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.\nA splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen, saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a round gray eye above the pool’s rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it, saw the pointer stop at thirty-three liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.\nSuperb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought. And she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water’s passage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a profound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.\nJessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar’s side. Way was made for her with casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul’s eyes, but the mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts.\nStilgar looked at her. “There were those among us in need of water,” he said, “yet they would come here and not touch this water. Do you know that?”\n“I believe it,” she said.\nHe looked at the pool. “We have more than thirty- eight million decaliters here,” he said. “Walled off from the little makers, hidden and preserved.”\n“A treasure trove,” she said.\nStilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes. “It is greater than treasure. We have thousands of such\ncaches. Only a few of us know them all.” He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow- Shadowed glow across face and beard. “Hear that?”\nThey listened.\nThe dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.\nTo Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing through him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move.\n“It has been calculated with precision,” Stilgar whispered. “We know to within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis.”\nA hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: “Bi-lal kaifa.”\n“We will\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a82d85b0f8efaa48f43ae5f9022f1b221f3687c50ec022753e4be3765279c689_v2"}
