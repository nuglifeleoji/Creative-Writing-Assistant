\n　　当售票员宣布只剩一张票的时候，那青年妇女丢下孩子，猛地把手抢先伸进了售票口。等那个男青年反应过来的时候，票已经到了那个姑娘的手里。那男青年刚要找售票员算帐，那小门却“啪”一声关了，小门板上“票已售完”四个字嘲开似地对着他（当然也对着我）。 \n　　那个男青年马上把全部的愤怒转向了那个青年妇女。他两只拳头紧捏着，开始用很维听的话斥责她，并强硬地让她把那张票交出来；说如果不交出来的话，她今天无论如何走不成。 \n　　说实话，我这时候在感情上毫无保留地站在那个男青年的一边。这并不是说我倒喜欢起他来了。尽管我对当今的年轻人反感，但我更反感不讲道理的人。 \n　　我看见那青年妇女在男青年暴风雨一般的攻击下，眼帘低垂着，嘴唇微微在颤抖，却说不出一句话来。 \n　　大概是她自己也认识到做了一件不太光彩的事吧？我内心里对她厚着脸皮插队买票虽然的反感的，但这时候对她的这种认错的表现却产生了某种好感。而且，我看见那个小女孩正紧紧依偎在她那理短发的妈妈怀里，一双眼睛望着那个可怕的“叔叔”，害怕得直哭。我很快把自己的同情心完全转到了这母子一边，反过来又对那个男青年咄咄逼人的态度生气了：你有理是有理，但在这妇幼面前逞好汉，不觉得害臊吗？ \n　　那个青年妇女牙咬着嘴唇，看来有点受不了，她不知嘟囔了句什么。结果，那个男青年更愤怒了。他凶狠地斥责她，并且胳膊也开始在空中一抡一抡的。坏了！看来他恐怕要动武了！ \n　　正在这时，我看见那个小姑娘却很勇敢地站在了那个横眉竖眼的男青年面前，两条小胳膊像小鸟的翅膀一样张开，护着她那理短发的妈妈，脸蛋上吊着两颗大泪珠，小嘴一张一张地说： \n　　“叔叔，求求你，不要打妈妈！” \n　　这小人儿的非凡举动，使那个男青年像一架疯狂转动着的机器突然切断了电源；那张暴怒的年轻有脸渐渐地缓和了下来。他有点吃惊地盯着那个胖胖的小姑娘，皱了一下眉头，随后，竟然举丐一只僵硬的手，在那小女孩的头上轻轻摩挲了一下，并且用一种极温柔的语调不连贯地说：“你……别怕！叔叔……不打人……” \n　　说完这句话后，他不知所措地把头扭到一边去，沉默了。
