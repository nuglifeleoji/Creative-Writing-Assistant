竟产生了如此复杂的大东西！欧洲人骂朕独裁暴政，扼杀了社会的创造力，其实在严格纪律约束下的大量的人，合为一个整体后也能产生伟大的智慧。”\n   “伟大的始皇帝，这是机器的机械运行，不是智慧。这些普通卑贱的人都是一个个0，只有在最前面加上您这样一个1，他们的整体才有意义。”牛顿带着奉承的微笑说。\n   “恶心的哲学。”冯·诺伊曼瞥了牛顿一眼说，“如果到时候，按你的理论和数学模型计算出的结果与预测不符，你我可就连零都不是了。”\n   “对，那时你们可真的什么都不是了！”秦始皇说着，拂袖而去。\n   \n   时光飞逝，人列计算机运行了一年零四个月，除去程序的调试时间，实际计算时间约一年两个月，这期间，只因乱纪元过分恶劣的气候中断过两次，但计算机存贮了中断现场数据，都成功地从断点恢复了运行。当秦始皇和欧洲学者们再次登上金字塔顶部时，第一阶段的计算已经完成，这批结果数据，精确地描述了以后两年太阳运行的轨道状况。\n   这是一个寒冷的黎明，彻夜照耀着巨大主板的无数火炬已经熄灭，计算机完成后，“秦1.0”进入待机状态，主板表面汹涌的浪涛变成了平静的微波。\n   冯·诺伊曼和牛顿将记录着运行结果的长卷呈献给秦始皇，牛顿说：“伟大的始皇帝，本来计算在三天前就已完成，之所以今天才将结果献给您，是因为按照计算结果，这一段漫长的寒夜就要结束，我们将迎来一个长恒纪元的第一次日出，这个恒纪元将持续一年之久，从太阳轨道参数看，气候宜人，请让您的王国从脱水中复活吧。”\n   “朕的国家自计算开始后从来就没有脱水过！”秦始皇一把抓过纸卷，没好气地说，“朕倾大秦之国力来维持计算机的运行，已经耗尽了所有储备，到现在，为此饿死累死和冻死热死的人不计其数。”秦始皇用纸卷指指远方，晨光中，可以看到从主板各个边缘，有几十条白线在大地上辐射向各个方向，消失在遥远的天边，那是全国各地向主板运送供给品的道路。\n   “陛下，您将发现这是值得的，在掌握了太阳的运行规律后，秦国将飞速发展，很快会比计算开始之前强大许多倍。”冯．诺伊曼说。\n   “按照计算，太阳就要升起来了，陛下，享受您的荣耀吧！”\n   仿佛是回应牛顿的话，一轮红日升出地平线，将金字塔和人列计算机笼罩在一片金光中。主板上爆发出一阵海潮般的欢呼声。\n   这时，一个人急匆匆地跑来，可能跑得太急了，下跪时气喘吁吁地趴到了地上，这是秦国的天文大臣。\n   “圣上，不好了，计算有误！大难将临！！”他哭喊道。\n   “你胡说\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
