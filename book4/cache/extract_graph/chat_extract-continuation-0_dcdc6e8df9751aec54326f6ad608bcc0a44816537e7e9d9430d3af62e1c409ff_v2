\n　　他看见润叶一直难受地低着头，急忙不知怎样安慰她，就急躁地说：“唉，要是小时候，谁敢欺负你，我就早把拳头伸出去了！你不记得，那年咱们在石圪节上高小，有个男同学专意给你身上扔篮球，我把那小子打得鼻子口里直淌血……再说，那时候，你要是看哪个土崖上有朵山丹丹花，或者一钵红酸枣，要我上去给你摘，那我都能让你满意……可现在，可这事……” \n　　润叶听他说着，突然用手捂住自己的脸哭了。 \n　　少安慌得不知如何是好，把半支没抽完的烟卷扔掉，又赶快卷另一支。 \n　　过了一会，润叶用手绢把脸上的泪痕抹去，不再哭了。刚才少安的话又使她深切地记起她和他过去那难以忘却的一切…… \n　　唉，她因为少女难以克服的羞怯，眼下一时不知怎样才能把她的心里话给少安哥说清楚。她原来看小说里的人谈恋爱，女的给男的什么话都敢说，而且说得那么自然。可是，当她自己面对心爱的人，一切话却又难以启唇。她对少安麻木不仁感到又急又气。多聪明的人，现在怎笨成这个样子？可话说回来，这又怎能怨他呢！她说的是别人追她，又没给他说明她对他的心意。 \n　　她看来不能继续用这种少安听不明白的话和他交谈了。但她又不能一下子鼓起勇气和他明说。 \n　　她只好随便问：“你家里最近都好吧？” \n　　这下可把少安解脱了！他赶忙说：“好着哩，就是……”他突然想，现在正可以给她说说姐夫的事了，就接着说：“只是我姐夫出了点事……” \n　　“什么事？”她认真地扬起脸问他。 \n　　“贩了几包老鼠药，让公社拉在咱们村的会战工地劳教，还让我爸跟着陪罪。一家人现在大哭小叫，愁得我没有办法……” \n　　“这真是胡闹！现在这社会太不象话了，把老百姓不当人看待……干脆，我让我二爸给咱们公社的白叔叔和徐叔叔写封信，明天我和你一起回石圪节找他们去！” \n　　润叶有点激动了。少安哥的事就是她的事。再说，有这事也好！这样她还可以和少安哥多呆一会时间，并且有借口和他一块坐汽车回去呢！ \n　　这也正是少安的愿望。不过他原来并没有想麻烦润叶亲自去石圪节，他只要她二爸出一下面就行了。 \n　　他对润叶说：“你不要回去了。只要你二爸有句话，我回去找白主任和徐主任。” \n　　“反正我明天没课。只要明晚上赶回来就行了。一整天到�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
