Twitch a trigger strand and Bell came running, mandibles flexing in anticipation. The twitch-words were “Archives” and “Analysis.”\nSeeing Bellonda in this light, Murbella saw the wisdom in the ways Odrade had employed her, flaws as valuable as the strengths. When Murbella finished the report, Bellonda still stood there in characteristic attitude.\nMurbella recognized that Bellonda looked on all who Summoned her as ones who had not measured up, people who called on Archives for frivolous reasons and had to be set straight. Frivolity: Bellonda’s béte noire. Murbella found this amusing.\nMurbella kept amusement masked while enjoying Bellonda. The way to deal with her was to be scrupulous. Nothing to subtract from strengths. This report was a model of concise and pertinent argument. She made her points with few embellishments, just enough to reveal her own conclusions.\n“Does it amuse you to summon me?” Bellonda asked.\nShe’s sharper than she was! Did I summon her? Not in so many words but she knows when she’s needed. She says here our Sisters must be models of meekness. Mother Superior may be anything she needs to be but not so the rest of the Sisterhood.\nMurbella touched the report. “A starting point.”\n“Then we should start before your friends find the comeye center.” Bellonda sank into her chairdog with familiar confidence. “Tam’s gone but | could send for Sheeana.”\n“Where is she?”\n“At the ship. Studying a collection of worms in the Great Hold, says any of us can be taught to control them.”\n“Valuable if true. Leave her. What of Scytale?”\n“Still in the ship. Your friends haven’t found him yet. We're keeping him under wraps.”\n“Let’s continue that. He’s a good reserve bargaining chip. And they’re not my friends, Bell. How are the Rabbi and his party?”\n“Comfortable but worried. They Know Honored Matres are here.”\n“Keep them under wraps.”\n“It’s uncanny. A different voice but | hear Dar.”\n“An echo in your head.”\nBellonda actually laughed.\n“Now here’s what you must spread among the Sisters. We act with extreme delicacy while showing ourselves as people to admire and emulate. ‘You Honored Matres may not choose to live as we live but you can learn our strengths.’”\n“Ahhhhhh.”\n“It comes down to ownership. Honored Matres are owned by things. ‘I want that place, that bauble, that person.’ Take what you want. Use it until you tire of it.”\n“While we go along our path admiring what we see.”\n“And there’s our flaw. We don’t give ourselves easily. Fear of love and affection! To be self-possessed has its own greed. ‘See what | have? You can’t have it unless you follow my ways!’ Never take that attitude with Honored Matres.”\n“Are you telling me we have to love them?”\n“How else can we make them admire us? That was Jessica’s victory. When she gave, she gave it all. So much bottled up by our ways and then that overwhelming wash: everything given. It’s irresistible.”\n“We don’t compromise that easily.”\n“No more do Honored Matres.”\n“That’s the way of their bureaucratic origins!”\n“Yet, theirs is a training ground for following the path of least resistance.”\n“You're confusing me, Da... Murbella.”\n“Have | said we should compromise? Compromise weakens us, and we know there are problems compromise cannot solve, decisions we must make no matter how bitter.”\n“Pretend to love them?”\n“That’s a beginning.”\n“It’ll be a bloody union, this joining of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre.”\n“I suggest we Share as widely as possible. We may lose people while Honored Matres are learning.”\n“A marriage made on the battlefield.”\nMurbella stood, thinking of Duncan in the no-ship, remembering the ship as she had seen it last. There it was finally, not hidden to any sense. A lump of strange machinery, oddly grotesque. A wild conglomeration of protrusions and juttings with no apparent purpose. Hard to imagine the thing lifting on its own power, enormous as that was, and vanishing into space.\nVanishing into space!\nShe saw the shape of Duncan’s mental mosaic.\nA piece that cannot be moved! Get in tune... Don’t think; do it!\nWith an abruptness that chilled her, she knew his decision.\nWhen you think to take determination of your fate into your own hands, that is the moment you can be crushed. Be cautious. Allow for surprises. When we create, there are always other forces at work.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nfd MI ove with extreme care,” Sheeana had warned him. Idaho did not think he needed warning but appreciated it nonetheless.\nPresence of Honored Matres on Chapterhouse eased his task. They made the ship’s Proctors and other guards nervous. Murbella’s orders kept her former Sisters out of the ship but everyone knew the enemy was here. Scanner relays showed a seemingly endless stream of lighters disgorging Honored Matres on the Flat. Most of the new arrivals appeared curious about that monstrous no-ship sitting there but no one disobeyed Great Honored Matre.\n“Not while she’s alive,” Idaho muttered where Proctors could hear him. “They have a tradition of assassinating their leaders to replace them. How long can Murbella hold out?”\nComeyes did his work for him. He knew his muttering would spread through the ship.\nSheeana came to him in his workroom shortly afterward and made a show of disapproval. “What are you trying to do, Duncan? You’re upsetting people.”\n“Go back to your worms!”\n“Duncan!”\n“Murbella’s playing a dangerous game! She’s all that stands between us and disaster.”\nHe already had voiced this worry to Murbella. It was not new to the watchers but reinforcement made everyone who\nheard him edgy—comeye monitors in Archives, ship guards, everyone.\nExcept Honored Matres. Murbella was keeping them out of Bellonda’s Archives.\n“Time for that later,” she said.\nSheeana had her cue. “Duncan, either stop feeding our worries or tell us what we should do. You’re a Mentat. Function for us.”\nAhhh, the Great Mentat performs for all to see.\n“What you should do is obvious but it’s not up to me. | can’t leave Murbella.”\nBut I can be taken away.\nNow it was up to Sheeana. She left him and went to spread her own brand of change.\n“We have the Scattering for our example.”\nBy evening, she had the Reverend Mothers in the ship neutralized and gave him a hand-signal that they could take the next step.\n“They will follow my lead.”\nWithout intending it, the Missionaria had set the stage for Sheeana’s ascendancy. Most Sisters knew the power latent in her. Dangerous. But it was there.\nUnused power was like a marionette with visible strings, nobody holding them. A compelling attraction: / could make it dance.\nFeeding the deception, he called Murbella.\n“When will | see you?”\n“Duncan, please.” Even in projection, she looked harried. “I’m busy. You know the pressures. l'Il be out in a few days.”\nProjection showed Honored Matres in the background scowling at this odd behavior in their leader. Any Reverend Mother could read their faces.\n“Has Great Honored Matre gone soft? That’s nothing but a man out there!”\nWhen he broke off, Idaho emphasized what every monitor on the ship had seen. “She’s in danger! Doesn’t she know\nit?”\nAnd now, Sheeana, it’s up to you.\nSheeana had the key to reinstate the ship’s flight controls. The mines were gone. No one could destroy the ship at the last instant with a signal to hidden explosives. There was only the human cargo to consider, Teg especially.\nTeg will see my choices. The others—the Rabbi's party and Scytale—will have to take their chances with us.\nThe Futars in their security cells did not worry him. Interesting animals but not significant at the moment. For that matter, he gave only a passing thought to Scytale. The little Tleilaxu remained under the eyes of guards, who were not relaxing their watch on him no matter their other worries.\nHe went to bed with a nervousness that had ready explanation for any watchdog in Archives.\nHis precious Murbella is in peril.\nAnd she was in peril but he could not protect her.\nMy very presence is a danger to her now.\nHe was up at dawn, back to the armory dismantling a weapons factory. Sheeana found him there and asked him to join her in the guard section.\nA handful of Proctors greeted them. The leader they had chosen did not surprise him. Garimi. He had heard about her performance at the Convocation. Suspicious. Worried. Ready to make her own gamble. She was a sober-faced woman. Some said she seldom smiled.\n“We have diverted the comeyes in this room,” Garimi said. “They show us having a snack and questioning you about weapons.”\nIdaho felt a knot in his stomach. Bell’s people would spot a simulation quickly. Especially a projected mock-up of himself.\nGarimi responded to his frown. “We have allies in Archives.”\nSheeana said: “We are here to ask if you wish to leave before we escape in this ship.”\nHis surprise was genuine.\nStay behind?\nHe had not considered it. Murbella was no longer his. The bond had been broken in her. She did not accept it. Not yet. But she would the first time she was asked to make a decision putting him in danger for Bene Gesserit purposes. Now, she merely stayed away from him more than was necessary.\n“You're going to Scatter?” he asked, looking at Garimi.\n“We'll save what we can. Voting with our feet, it was called once. Murbella is subverting the Bene Gesserit.”\nThere was the unspoken argument he had trusted to win them. Disagreement over Odrade’s gamble.\nIdaho took a deep breath. “I will go with you.”\n“No regrets!” Garimi warned.\n“That’s stupid!” he said, venting his repressed grief.\nGarimi would not have been surprised by that response from a Sister. Idaho shocked her and she was several seconds recovering. Honesty compelled her.\n“Of course it’s stupid. I’m sorry. You're sure you won’t stay? We owe you the chance to make your own decision.”\nBene Gesserit fastidiousness with those who served them loyally!\n“lll join you.”\nThe grief they saw on his face was not simulated. He wore it openly when he returned to his console.\nMy assigned position.\nHe did not try to hide his actions when he coded for the Ship’s ID circuits.\nAllies in Archives.\nThe circuits came flashing up on his projections—colored ribbons with a broken link into flight systems. The way around that breakage was visible after only a few moments’ study. Mentat observations had been prepared for it.\nMultiples through the core!\nIdaho sat back and waited.\nLift-off was a skull-rattling moment of blankness that stopped abruptly when they were far enough clear of the surface to engage nullfields and enter foldspace.\nIdaho watched his projection. There they were: the old couple in their garden setting! He saw the net shimmering in front of them, the man gest\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a character who works in the Archives and is known for her sharpness and no-nonsense attitude.
