\n　　不料，田晓霞马上说：“我去！你带车了没有？”“带了。”吴仲平说。他没想到一个姑娘要去冒这种险。他并不知道，这个姑娘的冒险精神闻名全报社。 \n　　田晓霞在说话之间便冲进自己的房子，不到两分钟就穿好衣服，肩上挂了个黄书包走出来，抓起楼道的电话，给值夜班的副总编打了招呼，就旋风一般跟吴仲平下了楼梯。她一边气喘吁吁往大门外跑，一边对吴仲平说：“谢谢你给了我一个机会！”勇敢的女记者情绪异常激动。他们此时还不知道双方都热恋着同一个家庭的兄妹俩。 \n　　小汽车在夜晚的风雨中驶过省城空无人迹的大街，在西郊转了一个急弯，箭似地冲进了飞机场。 \n　　省委书记乔伯年等人都已经在候机室的大厅里。没有人坐，他们站着等待最后一个人——副省长万国帮，他正最后一次和兰州空军部队联系。 \n　　停机坪上，一架直升飞机隆隆地响着，红色的信号灯在雨夜里一明一灭。 \n　　田晓霞奔进候机大厅，直接对省上几个主要领导说：“我是省报记者。请允许我和你们一同前往灾区……” \n　　省上的领导都非常惊讶：她怎么知道他们要搭机去南部灾区？ \n　　“飞机上没座位了！”省委常务副秘书长张生民不客气地说。 \n　　“报道这次特大洪水是我们的职责。如果误了事，你怕负不了这责任！”田晓霞语气强硬地对副秘书长说。在场的领导没有人知道她是田福军的女儿，但她的记者风度使所有的领导都注意到了这个姑娘。 \n　　“挤出一个位置，让她去！”乔伯年对张生民说。生民无话可说了。但他显然很不满意。在秘书长看来，这么大的事，记者去能解决个屁问题！ \n　　副省长万国帮一到，田晓霞就跟着省上的领导们钻进了已经发动起来的直升飞机机舱中。 \n　　飞机轰鸣着升上天空，在漆黑的雨夜向南部飞去。 \n　　黎明时分，飞机位临被水淹没的城市上空。从舷窗望下去，满眼黄水茫茫。城市的房屋半淹半露，一片极其悲惨的景象。所有的领导都不由紧捏着双拳；省委书记的眼里闪烁着泪花。 \n　　一个高地升起了一堆大火。这是地面上要求飞机降落的地方。 \n　　直升机掠过浪涛翻滚的水面，降落在地区师专的大操场上。 \n　　成千上万的人包围了飞机。省上的领导在一片恸哭声中走下来。地市领导象一群孤儿找到了爹娘，流着硒惶的泪水和上级领导紧紧握手。 \n　　于是\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
