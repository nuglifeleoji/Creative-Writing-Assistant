\n　　他后来的头发也再不用田海民理了，而固定在胡得禄和王彩娥的专业“夫妻店”理。通常他一到，两口子都一齐上，得禄理，彩娥洗，把其他顾客撇在一边不管，以此显出对他这颗头的特别关照。有几次，少安觉得王彩娥为他洗头时，曾用手在他头上明显地传达过一些“肉麻”的意思，这使得他以后尽量瞅胡得禄一个人在时，才进这个理发店。这个王彩娥！谁都敢下手！ \n　　现在，孙少安感到，门里门外的事都十分顺心。不久前，妻子如愿以偿生了个女儿。虽然因计划外生育，还没上了户口，但夫妻俩再不管它个户口不户口！要是几天不回去看看女儿，他就心慌意乱，甚事也干不成！妻子奶水和生虎子时一样旺，麻烦事也不是太多。少安只生气的是，孩子有个小病，父母亲和秀莲不好好到石圪节医院来看，常常把神汉刘玉升和他的徒弟田平娃叫到家里瞎折腾……父母亲已经搬回了新建的家院。少安满意的是，这院地方现在成了双水村最有气派的。新窑新门窗，还圈了围墙，盖了门楼，样样活都精细而讲究，他还打算在他不忙的时候，请米家镇的著名石匠雕打两只狮子蹲在门楼的两边。据村里的人回忆，旧社会只有金光亮他爸大门口有过石狮子。而那时，他父亲就在这老地主门上揽工种地，现在，孙玉厚的大门口要有威风凛凛的石狮子了……正在孙少安的事业炙手可热的时候，有一天，胡永合突然到石圪节来找他。老朋友上门，他赶紧在胡得福的食堂里为他摆了一桌。 \n　　永合是叫他一同去省里和电视台“洽谈”合资拍《三国演义》的事。 \n　　孙少安这才想起，他曾给永合承过这么一档子事。说实话：他早把这事忘了。他原来以为胡永合不过说说而已，没料到他却这样认真！ \n　　他被这家伙逼入了死角。这也许是一件相当没把握的事，他根本摸不着深浅。但是他既然给这家伙承了下来，就不好推辞。再说，这个有恩于自己的人，他怎么能不讲信义？经胡永合又一番鼓动之后，少安的心再一次热起来。 \n　　去它妈的，什么事倒不是人干的！几年前，他能想到他弄起这么大的摊场？可是现在不是弄得轰隆隆价把石圪节都震了？也许永合说得对！不能满足一辈子当个土财主，也不能只在石圪节有点名声；而应该把事干得响州震罢！。 \n　　于是，他马上回去对妻子说了他要去省城的事。秀莲一个妇道人家，她会把要卖的砖瓦数得一块不差\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
