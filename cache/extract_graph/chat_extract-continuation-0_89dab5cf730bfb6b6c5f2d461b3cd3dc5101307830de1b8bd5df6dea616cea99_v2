Be warned. Understand nothing. All comprehension is temporary.\n—MENTAT FIXE (ADACTO)\ndaho, seated alone at his console, encountered an entry\nhe had stored in Shipsystems during his first days of confinement, and found himself dumped (he applied the word later) into attitudes and sensory awareness of that earlier time. It no longer was afternoon of a frustrating day in the no-ship. He was back there, stretched between then and now the way serial ghola lives linked this incarnation to his original birth.\nImmediately, he saw what he had come to call “the net” and the elderly couple defined by criss-crossed lines, bodies visible through a shimmering of jeweled ropes—green, blue, gold, and a silver so brilliant it made his eyes ache.\nHe sensed godlike stability in these people, but something common about them. The word ordinary came to mind. The by-now-familiar garden landscape stretched out behind them: floral bushes (roses, he thought), rolling lawns, tall trees.\nThe couple stared back at him with an intensity that made Idaho feel naked.\nNew power in the vision! It no longer was confined to the Great Hold, an increasingly compulsive magnet drawing him down there so frequently he knew the watchdogs were alerted.\nIs he another Kwisatz Haderach?\nThere was a level of suspicion the Bene Gesserit could achieve that would kill him if it grew. And they were watching him now! Questions, worried speculations. Despite this, he could not turn away from the vision.\nWhy did that elderly couple look so familiar? Someone from his past? Family?\nMentat riffling of his memories produced nothing to fit the speculation. Round faces. Abbreviated chins. Fat wrinkles at the jowls. Dark eyes. The net obscured their color. The woman wore a long blue and green dress that concealed her feet. A white apron stained with green covered the dress from ample bosom to just below her waist. Garden tools dangled from apron loops. She carried a trowel in her left hand. Her hair was gray. Wisps of it had escaped a confining green scarf and blew around her eyes, emphasizing laughter lines there. She appeared . . . grandmotherly.\nThe man suited her as though created by the same artist as a perfect match. Bib overalls over a mounded stomach. No hat. Those same dark eyes with reflections twinkling in them. A brush of close-cropped wiry gray hair.\nHe had the most benign expression Idaho had ever seen. Upcurved smile creases at the corners of his mouth. He held a small shovel in his left hand, and on his extended right palm he balanced what appeared to be a small metal ball. The ball emitted a piercing whistle that made Idaho clap his hands over his ears. This did not stop the sound. It faded away of itself. He lowered his hands.\nReassuring faces. That thought aroused Idaho’s suspicions because now he recognized the familiarity. They looked somewhat like Face Dancers, even to the pug noses.\nHe leaned forward but the vision kept its distance. “Face Dancers,” he whispered.\nNet and elderly couple vanished.\nThey were replaced by Murbella in practice-floor leotards of glistening ebony. He had to reach out and touch her before he could believe she really stood there.\n“Duncan? What is it? You’re all sweaty.”\n“L... think it’s something the damned Tleilaxu planted in me. | keep seeing... . I think they're Face Dancers. They... they look at me and just now... . a whistle. It hurt.”\nShe glanced up at the comeyes but did not appear worried. This was something the Sisters could know without it presenting immediate dangers . . . except possibly to Scytale.\nShe sank to her haunches beside him and put a hand on his arm. “Something they did to your body in the tanks?”\n“No!”\n“But you said...”\n“My body’s not just a piece of new baggage for this trip. It has all of the chemistry and substance | ever had. It’s my mind that’s different.”\nThat worried her. She knew the Bene Gesserit concern over wild talents. “Damn that Scytale!”\n“I'll find it,” he said.\nHe closed his eyes and heard Murbella stand. Her hand went away from his arm.\n“Maybe you shouldn’t do that, Duncan.”\nShe sounded far away.\nMemory. Where did they hide the secret thing? Deep in the original cells? Until this moment, he had thought of his memory as a Mentat tool. He could call up his own images from long-ago moments in front of mirrors. Close up, examining an age wrinkle. Looking at a woman behind him —two faces in the mirror and his face full of questions.\nFaces. A succession of masks, different views of this person he called myself. Slightly imbalanced faces. Hair sometimes gray, sometimes the jet karakul of his current life. Sometimes humorous, sometimes grave and seeking inward for wisdom to meet a new day. Somewhere in all of that lay a consciousness that observed and deliberated. Someone who made choices. The Tleilaxu had tampered with that.\nIdaho felt his blood pumping hard and knew danger was present. This was what he was intended to experience... but not by the Tleilaxu. He had been born with it.\nThis ts what it means to be alive.\nNo memory from his other lives, nothing the Tleilaxu had done to him, none of that changed his deepest awareness one whit.\nHe opened his eyes. Murbella still stood near but her expression was veiled. So that’s how she will look as a Reverend Mother.\nHe did not like this change in her.\n“What happens if the Bene Gesserit fail?” he asked.\nWhen she did not reply, he nodded. Yes. That’s the worst assumption. The Sisterhood down history’s sewerpipe. And you don’t want that, my beloved.\nHe could see it in her face when she turned and left him.\nLooking up at the comeyes, he said: “Dar. | must talk to you, Dar.”\nNo response from any of the mechanisms around him. He had not expected one. Still, he knew he could talk to her and she would have to listen.\n“I’ve been coming at our problem from the other direction,” he said. And he imagined the busy whirring of recorders as they spun the sounds of his voice into ridulian crystals. “I’ve been getting into the minds of Honored Matres. | know I’ve done it. Murbella resonates.”\nThat would alert them. He had an Honored Matre of his own. But had was not the proper word. He did not have Murbella. Not even in bed. They had each other. Matched the way those people in his vision appeared to be matched. Was that what he saw there? Two older people sexually trained by Honored Matres?\n“I look at another issue now,” he said. “How to overcome the Bene Gesserit.”\nThat threw down the gauntlet.\n“Episodes,” he said. A word Odrade was fond of using.\n“That’s how we have to see what’s happening to us. Little episodes. Even the worst-case assumption has to be screened against that background. The Scattering has a magnitude that dwarfs anything we do.”\nThere! That demonstrated his value to the Sisters. It put Honored Matres in a better perspective. They were back here in the Old Empire. Fellow dwarves. He knew Odrade would see it. Bell would make her see it.\nSomewhere out there in the Infinite Universe, a jury had brought in a verdict against Honored Matres. Law and its managers had not prevailed for the hunters. He suspected that his vision had shown him two of the jurors. And if they were Face Dancers, they were not Scytale’s Face Dancers. Those two people behind the shimmering net belonged to no one but themselves.\nMajor flaws in government arise from a fear of making radical internal changes even though a need is clearly seen.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nor Odrade, the first melange of the morning was always\ndifferent. Her flesh responded like a starveling who clutched at sweet fruit. Then followed the slow, penetrating and painful restoration.\nThis was the fearful thing about melange addiction.\nShe stood at the window of her sleeping chamber waiting for the effect to run its course. Weather Control, she noted, had achieved another morning rain. The landscape was washed clean, everything immersed in a romantic haze, all edges blurred and reduced to essences like old memories. She opened the window. Damp cold air blew across her face, drawing recollections around her the way one put ona familiar garment.\nShe inhaled deeply. Smells after a rain! She remembered the essentials of life amplified and smoothed by falling water but these rains were different. They left a flinty aftersmell she could taste. Odrade did not like it. The message was not of things washed clean but of life resentful, wanting all rain stopped and locked away. This rain no longer gentled and brought fullness. It carried inescapable awareness of change.\nOdrade closed the window. At once, she was back in the familiar odors of her quarters, and that constant smell of shere from the metering implants required of everyone who knew the location of Chapterhouse. She heard Streggi enter, the slip-slip sounds of the desert map being changed.\nAn efficient sound in Streggi’s movements. Weeks of close association had confirmed Odrade’s first judgment. Reliable. Not brilliant but supremely sensitive to Mother Superior’s needs. Look how quietly she moved. Transfer Streggi’s sensitivity to the needs of young Teg and they had his required height and mobility. A horse? Much more.\nOdrade’s melange assimilation reached its peak and subsided. Streggi’s reflection in the window showed her waiting for assignment. She knew these moments were given over to the spice. At her stage, she would be looking forward to the day when she entered this mysterious enhancement.\n| wish her well of it.\nMost Reverend Mothers followed the teaching and seldom thought of their spice as addiction. Odrade knew it every morning for what it was. You took your spice during the day as your body demanded, following a pattern of early training: dosage minimal, just enough to whet the metabolic system and drive it into peak performance. Biological necessities meshed more smoothly with melange. Food tasted better. Barring accident or fatal assault, you lived much longer than you could without it. But you were addicted.\nHer body restored, Odrade blinked and considered Streggi. Curiosity about the morning’s long ritual was plain in her. Speaking to Streggi’s reflection in the window, Odrade said: “Have you learned about melange withdrawal?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior.”\nDespite warnings to keep awareness of addiction low key, it was never more than an eyeblink away from Odrade and she felt the accumulated resentments. Mental preparations as an acolyte (firmly impressed in the Agony) had been eroded by Other Memory and accumulations of time. The admonition: “Withdrawal removes an essential of your life\nand, if it occurs in late middle age, can kill you.” How little that meant now.\n“Withdrawal has intense meaning for me,” Odrade said. “l am one of those for whom the morning melange is painful. I’m sure they told you this happens.”\n“I’m sorry, Mother Superior.”\nOdrade studied the map. It showed a longer finger of desert thrusting northward and a pronounced widening of drylands to the southeast of Central where Sheeana had her station. Presently, Odrade returned her attention to Streggi, who was watching\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MENTAT FIXE<|>PERSON<|>Mentat Fixe is referenced as a source of wisdom or warning in the text, possibly a revered figure or title within the Bene Gesserit or related groups.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola, a cloned individual with memories of past lives, currently experiencing visions and suspected of being another Kwisatz Haderach.
