Alia and the Advocate stood frozen in their exposure.\nA disturbance toward the middle of the room caught Jessica’s attention and she forced a way through the throng, saw four supplicants holding the Priest official. His black cloth of intercession lay near his feet, a maula pistol exposed in its folds.\nAl-Fali thrust his way past Jessica, looked from the pistol to the Priest. The Fremen let out a cry of rage, came up from his belt with an achag blow, the fingers of his left hand rigid. They caught the Priest in the throat and he collapsed, strangling. Without a backward glance at the man he had killed, the old Naib turned an angry face toward the dais.\n“Dalal-il ’an-nubuwwa!” al-Fali called, placing both palms against his forehead, then lowering them. “The Qadis as- Salaf will not let me be silenced! If | do not slay those who interfere, others will slay them!”\nHe thinks he was the target, Jessica realized. She looked down at her sleeve, put a finger in the neat hole left by the\nmaula pellet. Poisoned, no doubt.\nThe supplicants had dropped the Priest. He lay writhing on the floor, dying with his larynx crushed. Jessica motioned to a pair of shocked courtiers standing at her left, said: “l want that man saved for questioning. If he dies, you die!” As they hesitated, peering toward the dais, she used Voice on them: “Move!”\nThe pair moved.\nJessica thrust herself to al-Fali’s side, nudged him: “You are a fool, Naib! They were after me, not you.”\nSeveral people around them heard her. In the immediate shocked silence, al-Fali glanced at the dais with its one toppled throne and Alia still seated on the other. The look of realization which came over his face could’ve been read by a novice.\n“Fedaykin,” Jessica said, reminding him of his old service to her family, “we who have been scorched know how to stand back to back.”\n“Trust me, My Lady,” he said, taking her meaning immediately.\nA gasp behind Jessica brought her whirling, and she felt al-Fali move to stand with his back to her. A woman in the gaudy garb of a city Fremen was straightening from beside the Priest on the floor. The two courtiers were nowhere to be seen. The woman did not even glance at Jessica, but lifted her voice in the ancient keening of her people—the call for those who serviced the deathstills, the call for them to come and gather a body’s water into the tribal cistern. It was a curiously incongruous noise coming from one dressed as this woman was. Jessica felt the persistence of the old ways even as she saw the falseness in this city woman. The creature in the gaudy dress obviously had killed the Priest to make sure he was silenced.\nWhy did she bother? Jessica wondered. She had only to wait for the man to die of asphyxiation. The act was a desperate one, a sign of deep fear.\nAlia sat forward on the edge of her throne, her eyes aglitter with watchfulness. A slender woman wearing the braid knots of Alia’s own guards strode past Jessica, bent over the Priest, straightened, and looked back at the dais. “He is dead.”\n“Have him removed,” Alia called. She motioned to guards below the dais. “Straighten the Lady Jessica’s chair.”\nSo you'll try to brazen it out! Jessica thought. Did Alia think anyone had been fooled? Al-Fali had spoken of the Qadis as-Salaf, calling on the holy fathers of Fremen mythology as his protectors. But no supernatural agency had brought a maula pistol into this room where no weapons were permitted. A conspiracy involving Javid’s people was the only answer, and Alia’s unconcern about her own person told everyone she was a part of that conspiracy.\nThe old Naib spoke over his shoulder to Jessica: “Accept my apologies, My Lady. We of the desert come to you as our last desperate hope, and now we see that you still have need of us.”\n“Matricide does not sit well on my daughter,” Jessica said.\n“The tribes will hear of this,” al-Fali promised.\n“If you have such desperate need of me,” Jessica asked, “why did you not approach me at the Convocation in Sietch Tabr?”\n“Stilgar would not permit it.”\nAhhh, Jessica thought, the rule of the Naibs! In Tabr, Stilgar’s word was law.\nThe toppled throne had been straightened. Alia motioned for her mother to return, said: “All of you please note the death of that traitor-Priest. Those who threaten me die.” She glanced at al-Fali. “My thanks to you, Naib.”\n“Thanks for a mistake,” al-Fali muttered. He looked at Jessica. “You were right. My rage removed one who Should’ve been questioned.”\nJessica whispered: “Mark those two courtiers and the woman in the colorful dress, Fedaykin. | want them taken\nand questioned.”\n“It will be done,” he said.\n“If we get out of here alive,” Jessica said. “Come, let us go back and play our parts.”\n“AS you say, My Lady.”\nTogether, they returned to the dais, Jessica mounting the steps and resuming her position beside Alia, al-Fali remaining in the supplicant’s position below.\n“Now,” Alia said.\n“One moment, daughter,” Jessica said. She held up her sleeve, exposed the hole with a finger through it. “The attack was aimed at me. The pellet almost found me even as | was dodging. You will all note that the maula pistol is no longer down there.” She pointed. “Who has it?”\nThere was no response.\n“Perhaps it could be traced,” Jessica said.\n“What nonsense!” Alia said. “/ was the—”\nJessica half turned toward her daughter, motioned with her left hand. “Someone down there has that pistol. Don’t you have a fear that—”\n“One of my guards has it!” Alia said.\n“Then that guard will bring the weapon to me,” Jessica said.\n“She’s already taken it away.”\n“How convenient,” Jessica said.\n“What are you saying?” Alia demanded.\nJessica allowed herself a grim smile. “I am saying that two of your people were charged with saving that traitor-Priest. | warned them that they would die if he died. They will die.”\n“I forbid it!”\nJessica merely shrugged.\n“We have a brave Fedaykin here,” Alia said, motioning toward al-Fali. “This argument can wait.”\n“It can wait forever,” Jessica said, speaking in Chakobsa, her words double-barbed to tell Alia that no argument would stop the death command.\n“We shall see!” Alia said. She turned to al-Fali. “Why are you here, Ghadhean al-Fali?”\n“To see the mother of Muad’Dib,” the Naib said. “What is left of the Fedaykin, that band of brothers who served her son, pooled their poor resources to buy my way in here past the avaricious guardians who shield the Atreides from the realities of Arrakis.”\nAlia said: “Anything the Fedaykin require, they have only\n“He came to see me,” Jessica interrupted. “What is your desperate need, Fedaykin?”\nAlia said: “I speak for the Atreides here! What is—”\n“Be silent, you murderous Abomination!” Jessica snapped. “You tried to have me killed, daughter | say it for all here to know. You can’t have everyone in this hall killed to silence them—as that Priest was silenced. Yes, the Naib’s blow would’ve killed the man, but he could’ve been saved. He could’ve been questioned! You have no concern that he was silenced. Spray your protests upon us as you will, your guilt is written in your actions!”\nAlia sat in frozen silence, face pale. And Jessica, watching the play of emotions across her daughter’s face, saw a terrifyingly familiar movement of Alia’s hands, an unconscious response which once had identified a deadly enemy of the Atreides. Alia’s fingers moved in a tapping rhythm—little finger twice, index finger three times, ring finger twice, little finger once, ring finger twice... and back through the tapping in the same order.\nThe old Baron!\nThe focus of Jessica’s eyes caught Alia’s attention and she glanced down at her hand, held it still, looked back at her mother to see the terrible recognition. A gloating smile locked Alia’s mouth.\n“So you have your revenge upon us,” Jessica whispered.\n“Have you gone mad, mother?” Alia asked.\n“I wish | had,” Jessica said. And she thought: She knows | will confirm this to the Sisterhood. She knows. She may even suspect I'll tell the Fremen and force her into a Trial of Possession. She cannot let me leave here alive.\n“Our brave Fedaykin waits while we argue,” Alia said.\nJessica forced her attention back to the old Naib. She brought her responses under control, said: “You came to see me, Ghadhean.”\n“Yes, My Lady. We of the desert see terrible things happening. The Little Makers come out of the sand as was foretold in the oldest prophecies. Shai-Hulud no longer can be found except in the deeps of the Empty Quarter. We have abandoned our friend, the desert!”\nJessica glanced at Alia, who merely motioned for Jessica to continue. Jessica looked out over the throng in the Chamber, saw the shocked alertness on every face. The import of the fight between mother and daughter had not been lost on this throng, and they must wonder why the audience continued. She returned her attention to al-Fali.\n“Ghadhean, what is this talk of Little Makers and the scarcity of sandworms?”\n“Mother of Moisture,” he said, using her old Fremen title, “we were warned of this in the Kitab al-lbar. We beseech thee. Let it not be forgotten that on the day Muad’Dib died, Arrakis turned by itself! We cannot abandon the desert.”\n“Hah!” Alia sneered. “The superstitious riffraff of the Inner Desert fear the ecological transformation. They—”\n“| hear you, Ghadhean,” Jessica said. “If the worms go, the spice goes. If the spice goes, what coin do we have to buy our way?”\nSounds of surprise: gasps and startled whispers could be heard spreading across the Great Hall. The Chamber echoed to the sound.\nAlia shrugged. “Superstitious nonsense!”\nAl-Fali lifted his right hand to point at Alia. “I speak to the Mother of Moisture, not to the Coan-Teen!”\nAlia’s hands gripped the arms of her throne, but she remained seated.\nAl-Fali looked at Jessica. “Once it was the land where nothing grew. Now there are plants. They spread like lice upon a wound. There have been clouds and rain along the belt of Dune! Rain, My Lady! Oh, precious mother of Muad’Dib, as sleep is death’s brother, so is rain on the Belt of Dune. It is the death of us all.”\n“We do only what Liet-Kynes and Muad’D\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is the daughter of Jessica and a key figure in the political and religious hierarchy, involved in a conspiracy and conflict with her mother.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is the mother of Alia and a powerful figure with deep ties to the Fremen, known as the Mother of Moisture.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AL-FALI<|>PERSON<|>Ghadhean al-Fali is a Naib and Fedaykin, a loyal servant to Jessica and her family, involved in the political struggles on Arrakis.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIEST<|>PERSON<|>The Priest is a conspirator involved in an assassination attempt on Jessica, later killed to silence him.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Naib who rules Sietch Tabr and prevented al-Fali from approaching Jessica earlier.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are the native people of Arrakis, deeply tied to its culture and ecology, and loyal to the Atreides.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEDAYKIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fedaykin are a elite group of Fremen warriors who served Muad'Dib and remain loyal to his family.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QADIS AS-SALAF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Qadis as-Salaf are holy figures in Fremen mythology, invoked by al-Fali for protection.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen settlement ruled by Stilgar, where a Convocation was held.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is the desert planet, also known as Dune, undergoing ecological transformation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPTY QUARTER<|>GEO<|>The Empty Quarter is a deep desert region on Arrakis where sandworms can still be found.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELT OF DUNE<|>GEO<|>The Belt of Dune is a region on Arrakis experiencing unexpected rain and ecological changes.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVOCATION<|>EVENT<|>The Convocation was a gathering at Sietch Tabr where al-Fali attempted to meet Jessica.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIAL OF POSSESSION<|>EVENT<|>A Trial of Possession is a Fremen legal and combat ritual Jessica considers invoking against Alia.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>ALIA<|>Jessica is the mother of Alia, but they are in conflict over political and personal issues, including an assassination attempt.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AL-FALI<|>JESSICA<|>Al-Fali is a loyal Fedaykin to Jessica, seeking her help for the Fremen and protecting her from threats.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AL-FALI<|>PRIEST<|>Al-Fali killed the Priest in rage, removing a conspirator but also a potential source of information.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>PRIEST<|>Jessica was the target of the Priest's assassination attempt, which was orchestrated by Alia's conspiracy.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>PRIEST<|>Alia was part of the conspiracy involving the Priest, who was silenced to prevent questioning.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>AL-FALI<|>Stilgar prevented al-Fali from approaching Jessica at the Convocation in Sietch Tabr.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>JESSICA<|>The Fremen are loyal to Jessica, known as the Mother of Moisture, and seek her help.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEDAYKIN<|>JESSICA<|>The Fedaykin are loyal to Jessica and her family, pooling resources to help al-Fali reach her.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>FREMEN<|>Alia is in conflict with the traditional Fremen, who oppose her actions and the ecological changes.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>SIETCH TABR<|>Jessica attended a Convocation at Sietch Tabr, where Stilgar prevented al-Fali from meeting her.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AL-FALI<|>ARRAKIS<|>Al-Fali is deeply concerned about the ecological changes on Arrakis and their impact on the Fremen.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>TRIAL OF POSSESSION<|>Jessica considers invoking a Trial of Possession against Alia to challenge her rule.<|>7\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
