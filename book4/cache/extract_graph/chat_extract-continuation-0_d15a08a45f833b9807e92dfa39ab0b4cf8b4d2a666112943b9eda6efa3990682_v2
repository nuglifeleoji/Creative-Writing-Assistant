�群山包围的城市了。他恍惚地立在汽车站外面，愕然地看着这个令人眼花缭乱的世界。他虽然上高中时曾因参加故事调讲会到这里来过一次，但此刻呈现在眼前的一切对他来说，仍然是陌生的。 \n　　一刹那间，他被庞大的城市震慑住了，甚至忘记了自己的存在。 \n　　这就是我要开始生活的地方吗？他在心里对自己发出了疑问。你，身上带着十几块钱，背着一点烂被褥，赤手空拳来到这里，你怎样才能生活下去呢？ \n　　这一切他自己全然不知道。 \n　　他此刻唯一意识到的是，他已经来到了一个“新大陆”。至于到这里怎么办，他一时的确还难以想象。 \n　　孙少平发了一会愣怔，便迈着沉重的脚步，往前走去。 \n　　到东关大桥的时候，他看见街道两边的人行道上，挤满了许多衣衫不整或穿戴破烂的人。他们身边都放着一卷象他一样可怜的行李；有的行李上还别着锤、钎、刨、錾、方尺、曲尺、墨斗和破蓝球改成的工具包。这些人有的心慌意乱地走来走去；有的麻木不仁地坐着；有的听天由命地干脆枕着行李睡在人行道上，少平马上知道，这就是他的世界。他将象这些人一样，要在这里等待人来买他的力气。 \n　　他便自然地加入了这个杂乱的阵营。找了一块空地方把行李搁下。周围没有人注意他参加到他们的队伍中来。和这些同行比起来，他除过皮肤还不算粗糙外，穿戴和行李没有什么异样的。 \n　　不过，他发现，他和他周围的所有人，也并不被街上行走的其他人所注意。由汽车、自行车和行人组成的那条长河，虽然就在他们身边流动，但实际上却是另外一个天地。街上走动的干部和市民们，没什么人认真地看一眼这些流落街头的外乡人。少平原来还担心碰见晓霞和金波，现在他才知道这种担心是多余的——这不象原西县和石圪节，熟人低头不见抬头见。再说，他们也不会想到他来黄原。 \n　　他不熟练地卷起一根旱烟棒，靠着自己的铺盖卷抽起来。此时已经是下午，黄原河被西斜的太阳照耀得一片金光灿烂。河西大片的楼房已经沉浸在麻雀山的阴影中。刚从寂静的山庄来到这里，城市千奇百怪的噪音听起来象洪水一般喧嚣。尽管满眼都是人群，但他感觉自己象置身于一片荒无人烟的旷野里。一种孤单和恐慌使他忍不住把眼睛闭起来。 \n　　现实的景象消失了。他通过心灵的视觉，却看见了炊烟袅袅的双水村；看见夕阳染红的东拉河边，饮饱水的黄牛抬起头来，静静地\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少平<|>PERSON<|>孙少平 is a character who
