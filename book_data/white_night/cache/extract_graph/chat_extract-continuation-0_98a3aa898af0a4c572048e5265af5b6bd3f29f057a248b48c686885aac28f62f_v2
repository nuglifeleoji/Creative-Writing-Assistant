银发扫过，水柱产生的水元素竟是完全被它吸附的一干二净，而蓝轩宇已经灵巧无比的到了侧面，身体旋转，就想要绕到娜娜身后。\n\n    娜娜一矮身，突然蹲了下来，她似乎也没调整什么角度，可蓝轩宇冲上去却像是正好正面撞上似的。\n\n    一个水涡从左手搓出，转瞬间向娜娜罩去，蓝轩宇立刻就想要再转身形。\n\n    娜娜张口一吸，那水涡竟是瞬间被她吸摄的一分不剩，更可怕的是，蓝轩宇只觉得一股吸力传来，他的身体已经不受控制的向前扑跌了过去。\n\n    双手赶忙抬起，试图抵挡，但娜娜却是红唇轻吹再吸。轻柔的吹开了他的双臂却把他的身体吸摄了过去。\n\n    “吧唧”一声，娜娜的红唇已经在蓝轩宇还有点婴儿肥的面颊上亲了一口。\n------------\n\n第四十七章 金龙惊天\n\n

 “学什么啊？”一说学习新东西，蓝轩宇顿时感兴趣起来。\n\n    娜娜道：“学一招古武战技吧。你的水元素控制已经相当不错，威力未来也会随着你的魂力提升而提升。近战有步法，至少不容易吃亏，但还欠缺一些近战的攻击手段。你是双生武魂，未来的方向就是左右配合，水元素和力量相结合。以你现在的魂力，自然还远不足以驾驭，所以先学一招相对简单一些的战技。”\n\n    “好啊、好啊！”男孩子哪有不喜欢进攻的。这几个月来，蓝轩宇一直在和娜娜学习步法，虽然也很有趣，但毕竟不那么霸气。\n\n    “娜娜老师，你要教我什么战技呀？”蓝轩宇充满期待的问道。\n\n    娜娜想了想，道：“这战技的名字，好像叫……，金龙惊天？”\n\n    “您也记不清了吗？”蓝轩宇有些好奇。\n\n
