少女看向他，四目相对，她微微一呆，“是你，是你的气息引导的我。不是他，他说谎对不对？”一边说着，她指了指身边的钱磊。\n\n    “没有啊！就是我、就是我啊！”钱磊顿时大叫起来。同龄美少女啊这可是，眼前这少女绝对是他见过的所有同龄女孩子中最漂亮的一个，男孩子在女孩子面前哪能没有表现欲望。\n\n    “不、不是你。”\n\n    “熔岩犬来了。”刘锋的声音响起。\n\n    果然，不只是十年熔岩犬，就连三只身材壮硕的百年熔岩犬都朝着这边缓缓的走了过来，口中烟雾缭绕，显然它们的火球又准备的差不多了。\n\n    少女眉头微蹙，深蓝色的双眸光芒一闪，突然变成了冰蓝色，紧接着，一黄一紫两个魂环已经从脚下升起。二环，大魂师！\n\n    蓝轩宇心中吃惊，从这少女的话语再加上她此时释放出的魂环来看，这哪里是什么异世界生物啊！分明就是一名二环魂师。\n\n    “爆！”少女右手一指，先前挡住熔岩犬的冰墙瞬间炸裂，不仅如此，那炸开的冰墙居然化为一道道冰刃四散纷飞，宛如一片冰雪风暴一般肆虐在他们身前半径五米范围内。\n\n    超过一半的十年熔岩犬被笼罩在内，顿时纷纷化为光芒消失不见，攻击力之强，竟至如斯。\n\n    少女脚下第一魂环亮起，一柄深蓝色长枪出现在掌握之中，脚尖点地，人就冲了出去。\n\n    她的动作曼妙自然，全身仿佛都有一层深蓝色的光晕伴随着身体的前冲而荡漾，每一枪刺出，都自然带起一片深蓝色枪芒，所过之处，那一只只十年熔岩犬竟是没有丝毫阻挡之力。纷纷被她刺中要害。她这枪法不止迅疾，更是精准无比，那些靠近她的熔岩犬，自然而然速度都会随之降低。\n\n    “好强啊！”同样是用枪，刘锋忍不住赞叹出声。人家这才是速度与力量的结合。\n\n    蓝轩宇眼看刘锋和钱磊都失去战斗力，也不能让人家孤身奋战，深吸口气，略微调整了一下自身，立刻就跟在后面冲了出去。\n\n    “嗷嗷！”三只百年熔岩犬发动了，又是三枚火球，呈品字形直奔那少女激射而去。\n\n    少女枪尾点地，娇躯纵身而起，身在空中，以手中长枪为前端骤然旋转起来，顿时，在她身体周围，带起一片深蓝色涟漪，宛如旋涡一般。三枚火球靠近，直接被那深蓝色旋涡带飞向周围。而她那旋转中的身形却是\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
