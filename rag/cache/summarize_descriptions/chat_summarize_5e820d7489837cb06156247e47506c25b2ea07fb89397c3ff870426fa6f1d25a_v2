It was the location of the **Teg family's dining room**, where Miles fondly recalls childhood memories of shared meals with his family. Additionally, Lernaeus was the site of his childhood home, where he encountered **Bene Gesserit acolytes**, including **Carlana**, hinting at early influences that may have shaped his later connections to the order. The planet thus holds personal and formative significance in Teg's life, serving as both a familial anchor and a backdrop for his early interactions with the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively paint Lernaeus as a place of warmth, family ties, and subtle political or religious undertones due to the presence of Bene Gesserit members. There are no direct contradictions in the provided details, only complementary layers that enrich the planet's role in Teg's history.
