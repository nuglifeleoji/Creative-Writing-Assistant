Certainly, she is strong. She was the only one to survive the wolves. But she is ruled by hate.”\n“Quite naturally. Tell me, Nayla, what will she do with the things she stole from me?”\n“Did Topri not inform you about the books which they say contain Your Sacred Words?”\nOdd how she can capitalize words only with her voice, Leto thought. He spoke curtly.\n“Yes, yes. The Ixians have a copy and soon the Guild and Sisterhood as well will be hard at work on them.”\n“What are those books, Lord?”\n“They are my words for my people. | want them to be read. What | want to know is what Siona has said about the Citadel charts she took.”\n“She says there is a great hoard of melange beneath Your Citadel, Lord, and the charts will reveal it.”\n“The charts will not reveal it. Will she tunnel?”\n“She seeks Ixian tools for that.”\n“Ix will not provide them.”\n“Is there such a hoard of spice, Lord?”\n“Yes.”\n“There is a story about how Your hoard is defended, Lord. That Arrakis itself would be destroyed if anyone tried to steal Your melange. Is it true?”\n“Yes. And that would shatter the Empire. Nothing would survive—not Guild or Sisterhood, not Ix or Tleilaxu, not even the Fish Speakers.”\nShe shuddered, then: “I will not let Siona try to get Your spice.”\n“Nayla! | commanded you to obey Siona in everything. Is this how you serve me?”\n“Lord?” She stood in fear of his anger, closer to a loss of faith than he had ever seen her. It was the crisis he had created, knowing how it must end. Slowly, Nayla relaxed. He could see the shape of her thought as though she had laid it out for him in illuminated words.\nThe ultimate test!\n“You will return to Siona and guard her life with your own,” Leto said. “That is the task | set for you and that you accepted. It is why you were chosen. It is why you carry a blade from Stilgar’s household.”\nHer right hand went to the crysknife concealed beneath her robe.\nHow sure it is, Leto thought, that a weapon can lock a person into a predictable pattern of behavior.\nHe stared with fascination at Nayla’s rigid body. Her eyes were empty of everything except adoration.\nThe ultimate rhetorical despotism... and I despise it!\n“Go then!” he barked.\nNayla turned and fled the Holy Presence.\nIs it worth this? Leto wondered.\nBut Nayla had told him what he needed to know. Nayla had renewed her faith and revealed with accuracy the thing which Leto could not find in Siona’s fading image. Nayla’s instincts were to be trusted.\nSiona has reached that explosive moment which I require.\nThe Duncans always think it odd that | choose women for combat forces, but my Fish Speakers are a temporary army in every sense. While they can be violent and vicious, women are profoundly different from men in their dedication to battle. The cradle of genesis ultimately predisposes them to behavior more protective of life. They have proved to be the best keepers of the Golden Path. | reinforce this in my design for their training. They are set aside for a time from ordinary routines. | give them special sharings which they can look back upon with pleasure for the rest of their lives. They come of age in the company of their sisters in preparation for events more profound. What you share in such companionship always prepares you for greater things. The haze of nostalgia covers their days among their sisters, making those days into something different than they were. That’s the way today changes history. All contemporaries do not inhabit the same time. The past is always changing, but few realize it.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nfter sending word to the Fish Speakers, Leto descended\nto the crypt in the late evening. He had found it best to begin the first interview with a new Duncan Idaho ina darkened room where the ghola could hear Leto describe himself before actually seeing the pre-worm body. There was a Small side room carved in black stone off the central rotunda of the crypt which suited this requirement. The chamber was large enough to accommodate Leto on his cart, but the ceiling was low. Illumination came from hidden glowglobes which he controlled. There was only the one door, but it was in two segments—one swinging wide to admit the Royal Cart, the other a small portal in human dimensions.\nLeto rolled his Royal Cart into the chamber, sealed the\nlarge portal and opened the smaller one. He composed himself then for the ordeal.\nBoredom was an increasing problem. The pattern of the Tleilaxu gholas had become boringly repetitious. Once, Leto had sent word warning the Tleilaxu to send no more Duncans, but they had known they could disobey him in this thing.\nSometimes | think they do it just to keep disobedience alive!\nThe Tleilaxu relied on an important thing which they knew protected them in other matters.\nThe presence of a Duncan pleases the Paul Atreides in me.\nAs Leto had explained it to Moneo in the majordomo’s first days at the Citadel:\n“The Duncans must come to me with much more than Tleilaxu preparation. You must see to it that my houris gentle the Duncans and that the women answer some of his questions.”\n“Which questions may they answer, Lord?”\n“They know.”\nMoneo had, of course, learned all about this procedure over the years.\nLeto heard Moneo’s voice outside the darkened room, then the sound of the Fish Speaker escort and the hesitantly distinctive footsteps of the new ghola.\n“Through that door,” Moneo said. “It will be dark inside and we will close the door behind you. Stop just inside and wait for the Lord Leto to speak.”\n“Why will it be dark?” The Duncan's voice was full of aggressive misgivings.\n“He will explain.”\nIdaho was thrust into the room and the door was sealed behind him.\nLeto knew what the ghola saw—only shadows among Shadows and blackness where not even the source of a voice could be fixed. As usual, Leto brought the Paul Muad’Dib voice into play.\n“It pleases me to see you again, Duncan.”\n“I can’t see you!”\nIdaho was a warrior, and the warrior attacks. This reassured Leto that the ghola was a fully restored original. The morality play by which the Tleilaxu reawakened a ghola’s pre-death memories always left some uncertainties in the gholas’ minds. Some of the Duncans believed they had threatened a real Paul Muad’Dib. This one carried such illusions.\n“I hear Paul’s voice but | can’t see him,” Idaho said. He didn’t try to conceal the frustrations, let them all come out in his voice.\nWhy was an Atreides playing this stupid game? Paul was truly dead in some long-ago and this was Leto, the carrier of Paul’s resurrected memories ... and the memories of many others!—if the Tleilaxu stories were to be believed.\n“You have been told that you are only the latest in a long line of duplicates,” Leto said.\n“I have none of those memories.”\nLeto recognized hysteria in the Duncan, barely covered by the warrior bravado. The cursed Tleilaxu post-tank restoration tactics had produced the usual mental chaos. This Duncan had arrived in a state of near shock, strongly suspecting he was insane. Leto knew that the most subtle powers of reassurance would be required now to soothe the poor fellow. This would be emotionally draining for both of them.\n“There have been many changes, Duncan,” Leto said. “One thing, though, does not change. | am still Atreides.”\n“They said your body is...”\n“Yes, that has changed.”\n“The damned Tleilaxu! They tried to make me kill someone |... well, he looked like you. | suddenly remembered who | was and there was this . . . Could that have been a Muad’Dib ghola?”\n“A Face Dancer mimic, | assure you.”\n“He looked and talked so much like... Are you sure?”\n“An actor, no more. Did he survive?”\n“Of course! That’s how they wakened my memories. They explained the whole damned thing. Is it true?”\n“It’s true, Duncan. | detest it, but | permit it for the pleasure of your company.”\nThe potential victims always survive, Leto thought. At least for the Duncans I see. There have been slips, the fake Paul slain and the Duncans wasted. But there are always more cells carefully preserved from the original.\n“What about your body?” Idaho demanded.\nMuad’Dib could be retired now; Leto resumed his usual voice. “| accepted the sandtrout as my skin. They have been changing me ever since.”\n“Why?”\n“I will explain that in due course.”\n“The Tleilaxu said you look like a sandworm.”\n“What did my Fish Speakers say?”\n“They said you're God. Why do you call them Fish Speakers?”\n“An old conceit. The first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams. They learned valuable things that way.”\n“How do you know?”\n“I am those women ...and everything that came before and after them.”\nLeto heard the dry swallowing in Idaho’s throat, then: “I see why the darkness. You’re giving me time to adjust.”\n“You always were quick, Duncan.”\nExcept when you were slow.\n“How long have you been changing?”\n“More than thirty-five hundred years.”\n“Then what the Tleilaxu told me is true.”\n“They seldom dare to lie anymore.”\n“That’s a long time.”\n“Very long.”\n“The Tleilaxu have ... copied me many times?”\n“Many.”\nIt’s time you asked how many, Duncan.\n“How many of me?”\n“I will let you see the records for yourself.”\nAnd so it starts, Leto thought.\nThis exchange always appeared to satisfy the Duncans, but there was no escaping the nature of the question:\n“How many of me?”\nThe Duncans made no distinctions of the flesh even though no mutual memories passed between gholas of the same stock.\n“I remember my death,” Idaho said. “Harkonnen blades, lots of them trying to get at you and Jessica.”\nLeto restored the Muad’Dib voice for momentary play: “| was there, Duncan.”\n“I’m a replacement, is that right?” Idaho asked.\n“That’s right,” Leto said.\n“How did the other... me...I mean, how did he die?”\n“All flesh wears out, Duncan. It’s in the records.”\nLeto waited patiently, wondering how long it would be until the tamed history failed to satisfy this Duncan.\n“What do you really look like?” Idaho asked. “What’s this sandworm body the Tleilaxu described?”\n“It will make sandworms of sorts someday. It’s already far down the road of metamorphosis.”\n“What do you mean of sorts?”\n“It will have more ganglia. It will be aware.”\n“Can't we have some light? I'd like to see you.”\nLeto commanded the floodlights. Brilliant illumination filled the room. The black walls and the lighting had been arranged to focus the illumination on Leto, every visible detail revealed.\nIdaho swept his gaze along the faceted silvery-gray body, noted the beginnings of a sandworm’s ribbed sections, the sinuous flexings .. . the small protuberances which had once\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor with a sandworm-like body, carrying the memories of Paul Atreides and others, ruling the Empire and guiding the Golden Path\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NAYLA<|>PERSON<|>Nayla is a loyal servant of Leto, tasked with guarding Siona and carrying a crysknife from Stilgar’s household\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a rebel who stole Leto’s Citadel charts and seeks Ixian tools to tunnel for melange\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A ghola of the original Duncan Idaho, restored by the Tleilaxu, serving Leto as a warrior and confidant\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a historical figure whose household provided Nayla’s crysknife\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is Leto’s majordomo, managing the Citadel and the Duncan gholas\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leto’s all-female army, dedicated to protecting the Golden Path\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ix is a technological power, known for its advanced tools and machinery\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Spacing Guild, a powerful faction in the Empire, controls interstellar travel\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, a secretive and influential order\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TLEILAXU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tleilaxu are a faction known for their ghola technology and genetic manipulation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>GEO<|>Leto’s fortress, rumored to hold a vast hoard of melange\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>The desert planet, source of melange, and home to Leto’s Citadel\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>A prison in Tiruzia where hostages were held\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>Leto’s grand plan to ensure humanity’s survival, guarded by the Fish Speakers\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>NAYLA<|>Leto commands Nayla to obey Siona, testing her loyalty<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SIONA<|>Leto monitors Siona’s rebellion as part of his plan for the Golden Path<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Leto values Duncan’s companionship and uses him as a confidant<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>Leto created and leads the Fish Speakers to protect the Golden Path<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>IX<|>Leto interacts with Ix for technology but restricts their tools<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GUILD<|>Leto’s actions could destabilize the Guild’s control over space travel<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SISTERHOOD<|>Leto’s rule challenges the Bene Gesserit’s influence<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TLEILAXU<|>Leto tolerates the Tleilaxu’s ghola production despite their disobedience<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>CITADEL<|>Leto resides in the Citadel, which holds his melange hoard<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ARRAKIS<|>Leto’s transformation is tied to Arrakis and its melange<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>Leto orchestrates the Golden Path to ensure humanity’s future<|>10\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>NAYLA<|>Nayla is tasked with guarding Siona, despite her hatred for her<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SIONA<|>IX<|>Siona seeks Ixian tools to tunnel for Leto’s melange<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TLEILAXU<|>The Tleilaxu restore Duncan’s memories and provide him to Leto<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>The Fish Speakers are dedicated to protecting the Golden Path<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CITADEL<|>ARRAKIS<|>The Citadel is located on Arrakis, the source of melange<|>8\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
