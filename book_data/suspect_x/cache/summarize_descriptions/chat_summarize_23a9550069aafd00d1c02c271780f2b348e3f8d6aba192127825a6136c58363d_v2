Her death and the consecration of her water are noted as instrumental in Leto's transformation, underscoring her spiritual and symbolic importance. Ghani is revered as a precious figure within the Atreides family, embodying hope for the future, as acknowledged by Leto himself.  \n\nHer role extends beyond familial ties, as she is mentioned in the context of potential marriage to secure the Atreides bloodline, highlighting her strategic value in dynastic politics. Ghani is also deeply involved in philosophical and political discussions with Leto, engaging with factions such as the Bene Gesserit and contributing to broader schemes within the narrative.  \n\nA key moment in her arc includes a conversation with Leto about prescient dreams and their shared search for The Preacher, demonstrating her intellectual and mystical engagement with the unfolding events. Additionally, Ghani is privy to the dark secret of Alia's possession by a demon, further cementing her role as a confidante and ally to Leto.  \n\nHer presence is also tied to ceremonial significance, particularly in relation to water rings intended for a wedding, suggesting her involvement in rituals that blend tradition with deeper metaphysical meaning.  \n\nIn summary, GHANI is a multifaceted character whose influence spans familial, political, philosophical, and spiritual realms.
