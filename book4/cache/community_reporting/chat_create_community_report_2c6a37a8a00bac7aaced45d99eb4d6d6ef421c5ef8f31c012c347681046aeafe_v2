However, her approach has not been without controversy; she faces criticism from some community members, including 冯国斌, who question her methods and the content she introduces to her students. Despite this, she remains determined to defend her teaching style and the value it brings to her students.\n\n吴月琴's life is further complicated by her romantic relationship, which is subject to societal scrutiny and rumors, particularly regarding her connection with the team leader of the 三队. This relationship adds to her emotional struggles, as she navigates the pressures and expectations of her community while expressing vulnerability and a desire for connection with 运生.\n\nAs she prepares to leave her village, 吴月琴 reflects on her emotional ties to the people there, especially to 冯国斌 and her students.
