\n　　唉，身体垮了，儿女的婚事又是那么叫人不顺心，他田福堂在这世界上活得还有什么乐趣？ \n　　想不通啊！过去毛主席讲的革命道理他一下子就理解了，但他现在却怎么也理解不了自己儿女的所作所为。 \n　　女儿润叶先前不和女婿一块生活，他理解不了；后来女婿断了双腿，成了终身残废，她偏偏又和他生活在一块，他也理解不了。更叫他难以理解的是，死小子润生丢下他老两口，竟然撵到外县农村，和那个拉扯着前夫孩子的寡妇结婚了…… \n　　他理解不了归他理解不了，现在生米都做成了熟饭，他这个为老人的又有什么办法！ \n　　不过，外人并不了解，最近一些日子，田福堂在无限的酸楚之中，心头似乎多少产生了一点温热之情，女儿和儿子先后给他们来了信，说身边都有了孩子。女儿生了个男孩，儿子添了女孩。噢，不论怎说，一丝欣慰之感油然而生。他田福堂有了孙子？这可终究是田家的骨血啊！ \n　　为此，他老两口不由心热地哭了一鼻子。老伴提出，让他到儿子和女儿那里走一趟，看看他们的小孙孙。同时，她还小心翼翼试探着问他：能不能把润生一家人接回双水村来？他当时尽管没言传，心也不由一动。当然，所有这些也许还得要过段时间，让他把自己的别扭情绪理一理再说。去女儿那里问题不大。虽说向前成了残废，可他和女婿在感情上一直好着哩。腿砸断不由人啊，正如他的肺气肿一样。现在，他只不过为女儿一辈子的不幸命运感到难过罢了。但他无法原谅润生。啊，不孝之子！哪里找不下个媳妇，为什么偏偏和一个寡妇结婚呢？再说，这女人还带着前夫的娃娃，成份也不好！ \n　　可是，想来想去，儿子还是自己的，并且就这么一个儿子，他亲他。而今，他和老伴都老了，身边没个人照料，日子也难过。唉，也许润生他妈说得对，不论他们怎样反对这门亲事。可现在既然豆蔓子缠在玉米杆上，他最终不得不承认这个不愿承认的事实……田福堂一整天卷曲在那个破碾盘上，一边合住眼晒太阳，一边在心里反反复复地盘算儿女好的事，至于村中大大小小的“工作”，一般他都推给金俊山去处理了。现在这村里还有什么正经工作可做？都是些民事纠纷！让不嫌麻烦的金俊山和爱管闲事的孙玉亭这些人调解去吧！
