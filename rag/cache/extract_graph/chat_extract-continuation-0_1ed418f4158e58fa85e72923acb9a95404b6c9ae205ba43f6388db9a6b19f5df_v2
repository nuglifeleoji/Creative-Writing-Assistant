But Moneo felt that the news he brought this morning was guaranteed to arouse The Worm Who Is God.\nHow to present it?\nDawn lay only an hour past, the fourth Festival Day, a fact Moneo could greet with equanimity only because it brought him that much nearer the end of these tribulations.\nLeto stirred as Moneo entered the small chamber. Illumination came on at his signal, focusing only on his face.\n“Good morning, Moneo,” he said. “My guard tells me you insisted on entering immediately. Why?”\nThe danger, Moneo knew from experience, lay in the temptation to reveal too much too soon.\n“I have spent some time with the Reverend Mother Anteac,” he said. “Although she keeps it well hidden, I’m sure she is a Mentat.”\n“Yes. The Bene Gesserit were bound to disobey me sometime. This form of disobedience amuses me.”\n“Then you will not punish them?”\n“Moneo, | am ultimately the only parent my people have. A parent must be generous as well as severe.”\nHe’s in a good mood, Moneo thought. A small sigh escaped Moneo, at which Leto smiled.\n“Anteac objected when | told her you had ordered an amnesty for a selected few Face Dancers among our Captives.”\n“I have a Festive use for them,” Leto said.\n“Lord?”\n“ĮI will tell you later. Let’s get to the news which brings you bursting in upon me at this hour.”\n“I... ahhh...” Moneo chewed at his upper lip. “The Tleilaxu have been quite garrulous in the attempt to ingratiate themselves with me.”\n“Of course they have. And what have they revealed?”\n“They ... ahhh, provided the Ixians with sufficient advice\nand equipment to make a... uhhh, not exactly a ghola, and not even a clone. Perhaps we should use the Tleilaxu term: a cellular restructuring. The... ahhh, experiment was\nconducted within some sort of shielding device which the Guildsmen assured them your powers could not penetrate.”\n“And the result?” Leto felt that he was asking the question in a cold vacuum.\n“They are not certain. Tleilaxu were not permitted to witness. However, they did observe that Malky entered this... ahhh, chamber and that he emerged later with an infant.”\n“Yes! | know!”\n“You do?” Moneo was puzzled.\n“By inference. And all of this happened some twenty-six years ago?”\n“That is correct, Lord.”\n“They identify the infant as Hwi Noree?”\n“They are not certain, Lord, but...” Moneo shrugged.\n“Of course. And what do you deduce from this, Moneo?”\n“There is a deep purpose built into the new Ixian Ambassador.”\n“Certainly there is. Moneo, has it not struck you as odd how much Hwi, the gentle Hwi, represents a mirror of the redoubtable Malky? His opposite in everything, including sex.”\n“I had not thought of that, Lord.”\n“I have.”\n“I will have her sent back to Ix immediately,” Moneo said.\n“You will do nothing of the kind!”\n“But, Lord, if they...”\n“Moneo, | have observed that you seldom turn your back on danger. Others often do, but you—seldom. Why would you have me engage in such an obvious stupidity?”\nMoneo swallowed.\n“Good. | like it when you recognize the error of your ways,” Leto said.\n“Thank you, Lord.”\n“Il also like it when you express your gratitude sincerely, as you have just done. Now, Anteac was with you when you heard these revelations?”\n“As you ordered, Lord.”\n“Excellent. That will stir things up a bit. You will leave now and go to the Lady Hwi. You will tell her that | desire to see her immediately. This will disturb her. She is thinking that we will not meet again until | summon her to the Citadel. | want you to quiet her fears.”\n“In what way, Lord?”\nLeto spoke sadly: “Moneo, why do you ask advice on something at which you are an expert? Calm her and bring her here reassured of my kindly intentions toward her.”\n“Yes, Lord.” Moneo bowed and backed away a step.\n“One moment, Moneo!”\nMoneo stiffened, his gaze fixed on Leto’s face.\n“You are puzzled, Moneo,” Leto said. “Sometimes you do not know what to think of me. Am | all-powerful and all- prescient? You bring me these little dibs and dabs and you wonder: Does he already know this? If he does, why do I bother? But | have ordered you to report such things, Moneo. Is your obedience not instructive?”\nMoneo started to shrug and thought better of it. His lips trembled.\n“Time can also be a place, Moneo,” Leto said. “Everything depends upon where you are standing, on where you look or what you hear. The measure of it is found in consciousness itself.”\nAfter a long silence, Moneo ventured: “Is that all, Lord?”\n“No, itis not all. Siona will receive today a package delivered to her by a Guild courier. Nothing is to interfere with delivery of that package. Do you understand?”\n“What is... what is in the package, Lord?”\n“Some translations, reading matter which | wish her to see. You will do nothing to interfere. There is no melange in the package.”\n“How ... how did you know what | feared was in the...” “Because you fear the spice. It could extend your life, but you avoid it.”\n“| fear its other effects, Lord.”\n“A bountiful nature has decreed that melange will unveil for some of us unexpected depths of the psyche, yet you fear this?”\n“lam Atreides, Lord!”\n“Ahhh, yes, and for the Atreides, melange may roll the mystery of Time through a peculiar process of internal\nrevelation.”\n“I have only to remember the way you tested me, Lord.”\n“Do you not see the necessity for you to sense the Golden Path?”\n“That is not what | fear, Lord.”\n“You fear the other astonishment, the thing which made me make my choice.”\n“I have only to look at you, Lord, and know that fear. We Atreides . . .” He broke off, his mouth dry.\n“You do not want all of these memories of ancestors and the others who flock within me!”\n“Sometimes... Sometimes, Lord, | think the spice is the Atreides curse!”\n“Do you wish that / had never occurred?”\nMoneo remained silent.\n“But melange has its values, Moneo. The Guild navigators need it. And without it, the Bene Gesserit would degenerate into a helpless band of whining females!”\n“We must live with it or without it, Lord. | know that.”\n“Very perceptive, Moneo. But you choose to live without it.”\n“Do | not have that choice, Lord?”\n“For now.”\n“Lord, what do you...”\n“There are twenty-eight different words for melange in common Galach. They describe it by its intended use, by its dilution, by its age, by whether it came through honest purchase, through theft or conquest, whether it was the dower gift for a male or for a female, and in many other ways is it named. What do you make of this, Moneo?”\n“We are offered many choices, Lord.”\n“Only where the spice is concerned?”\nMoneo’s brow wrinkled in thought, then: “No.”\n“You so seldom say ‘no’ in my presence,” Leto said. “l enjoy watching your lips form around the word.”\nMoneo’s mouth twitched in an attempted smile.\nLeto spoke briskly: “Well! You must go now to the Lady Hwi. | will give you one parting piece of advice which may help.”\nMoneo paid studious attention to Leto’s face.\n“Drug knowledge originated mostly with males because they tend to be more venturesome—an outgrowth of male aggression. You’ve read your Orange Catholic Bible, thus you know the story of Eve and the apple. Here’s an interesting fact about that story: Eve was not the first to pluck and sample the apple. Adam was first and he learned by this to put the blame on Eve. My story tells you something about how our societies find a structural necessity for sub-groups.”\nMoneo tipped his head slightly to the left. “Lord, how does this help me?”\n“It will help you with the Lady Hwi!”\nThe singular multiplicity of this universe draws my deepest attention. It is a thing of ultimate beauty.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nBe heard Moneo in the antechamber just before Hwi entered the small audience room. She wore voluminous pale green pantaloons tightly tied at the ankles with darker green bows to match her sandals. A loose blouse of the same dark green could be seen under her black cloak.\nShe appeared calm as she approached Leto and sat without being invited, choosing a golden cushion rather than the red one she had occupied earlier. It had taken less than an hour for Moneo to bring her. Leto’s acute hearing detected Moneo fidgeting in the anteroom and Leto sent a signal which sealed the arched doorway there.\n“Something has disturbed Moneo,” Hwi said. “He tried very hard not to reveal this to me, but the more he tried to soothe me the more he aroused my curiosity.”\n“He did not frighten you?”\n“Oh, no. He did say something very interesting, though. He said that | must remember it at all times, that the God Leto is a different person to each of us.”\n“How is this interesting?” Leto asked.\n“The interesting thing is the question for which this was the preface. He said he often wonders what part we play in creating that difference in you.”\n“That /s interesting.”\n“I think it is a truthful insight,” Hwi said. “Why have you summoned me?”\n“At one time, your masters on Ix...”\n“They are no longer my masters, Lord.”\n“Forgive me. | will refer to them hereafter as the Ixians.”\nShe nodded gravely, prompting: “At one time...”\n“The Ixians contemplated making a weapon—a type of hunter-seeker, self-propelled death with a machine mind. It was to be designed as a self-improving thing which would seek out life and reduce that life to its inorganic matter.”\n“I have not heard of this thing, Lord.”\n“I know that. The Ixians do not recognize that machine- makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine. This is ultimate sterility. Machines always fail... given time. And when these machines failed there would be nothing left, no life at all.”\n“Sometimes | think they are mad,” she said.\n“Anteac’s opinion. That is the immediate problem. The Ixians are now engaged in an endeavor which they are concealing.”\n“Even from you?”\n“Even from me. | am sending the Reverend Mother Anteac to investigate for me. To help her, | want you to tell her everything you can about the place where you spent your childhood.
