Dune had seen winds of more than seven hundred kmh. Even space lighters took notice of such force. Air travel would be subject to the constant whims of surface conditions. And frail human flesh must find whatever shelter it could.\nAs we always have.\nThe lounge at the Flat was old. Stone inside and out, their first major building material here. Spartan slingchairs and low tables of molded plaz were more recent. Economy could not be ignored even for Mother Superior.\nThe lighter arrived in a dusty maelstrom. No nonsense about suspensor cushioning. This would be a quick lift with uncomfortable gees but not high enough to damage flesh.\nOdrade felt almost disembodied as she said her final farewells and turned Chapterhouse over to a triumvirate of Sheeana, Murbella, and Bellonda. One last word: “Don’t interfere with Teg. And | don’t want anything nasty happening to Duncan. Hear me, Bell?”\nAll of the wonderful technological things they could accomplish and they still could not keep a thick sandstorm from almost blinding them as they lifted. Odrade closed her eyes and accepted the fact that she was not to get a last low-level overview of her beloved planet. She awoke to the thump of docking. Buzzcar waiting in a corridor just beyond the lock. Ahumming traverse to their quarters. Tamalane, Dortujla, and the acolyte servant maintained silence, respecting Mother Superior’s desire to be with her own thoughts.\nThe quarters, at least, were familiar, standard on Bene Gesserit ships: a small sitting-dining room in elemental plaz of uniform light green; smaller sleeping chamber with walls in the same color and a single hard cot. They knew Mother Superior’s preferences. Odrade glanced into a usiform bath and toilet. Standard facilities. Adjoining quarters for Tam and Dortujla were similar. Time later to look at the ship’s refittings.\nAll essentials had been provided. Including unobtrusive elements of psychological support: subdued colors, familiar furnishings, a setting to disturb none of her mental processes. She gave orders for departure before returning to her sitting-dining room.\nFood was waiting on a low table—blue fruit, sweet and plummy, a savory yellow spread on bread tailored to her energy needs. Very good. She watched the assigned acolyte at her self-effacing work arranging Mother Superior’s effects. The name evaded Odrade for a second, then: Su/pol.\nA dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient.\nIt struck Odrade suddenly that these assignments had an element of callousness in them. A small entourage, not to offend Honored Matres. And keep our losses to a minimum.\n“Have you unpacked all of my things, Suipol?”\n“Yes, Mother Superior.” Very proud of having been chosen for this important assignment. It showed in her walk as she left.\nThere are some things you cannot unpack for me, Suipol. | carry those in my head.\nNo Bene Gesserit from Chapterhouse ever left the planet without taking along a certain amount of chauvinism. Other places were never quite as beautiful, never quite as serene, never as pleasant a habitat.\nBut this is the Chapterhouse that was.\nIt was an aspect of the desert transformation she had never before viewed in quite that way. Chapterhouse was removing itself. Going away, never to return, at least not in the lifetimes of those who knew it now. It was like being abandoned by a beloved parent—disdainfully and with malice.\nYou are no longer important to me, child.\nOn the way to becoming a Reverend Mother, they were taught early that travel could provide a peaceful byway for rest. Odrade fully intended to take advantage of this and told her companions immediately after eating, “Spare me details.”\nSuipol was sent to summon Tamalane. Odrade spoke in Tam’s own terse meter. “Inspect the refitting and tell me what I should see. Take Dortujla.”\n“Good head, that one.” High praise from Tam.\n“When we're through, isolate me as much as possible.”\nDuring part of the crossing, Odrade strapped herself into the webbing of her cot and occupied herself composing what she thought of as a last will and testament.\nWho would be executor?\nMurbella was her personal choice, especially after the Sharing with Sheeana. Still... the Dune waif remained a potent candidate if this venture to Junction failed.\nSome assumed any Reverend Mother could serve if responsibility fell on her. But not in these times. Not with this trap set. Honored Matres were unlikely to avoid the pitfall.\nIf we've judged them correctly. And Murbella’s data says we’ve done our best. The opening is there for Honored Matres to enter, and oh, how inviting it will appear. They won't see the dead end until they're well into it. Too late!\nBut what if we fail?\nSurvivors (if any) would hold Odrade in contempt.\n| have often felt diminished but never an object of contempt. Yet the decisions | made may never be accepted by my Sisters. At least, |! make no excuses... not even to the ones with whom I Shared. They know my response comes from the darkness before a human dawn. Any of us may do a futile thing, even a stupid thing. But my plan can give us victory. We will not “just survive.” Our grail requires us to persist together. Humans need us! Sometimes, they need religions. Sometimes, they need merely know their beliefs are as empty as their hopes for nobility. We are their source. After the masks are removed, that remains: Our Niche.\nShe felt then that this ship was taking her into the pit. Closer and closer to awful threat.\n| go to the axe; it does not come to me.\nNo thoughts of exterminating this foe. Not since the Scattering magnified human population had that been possible. A flaw in Honored Matre schemes.\nThe high-pitched beep and flashing orange light that signaled arrival brought her out of repose. She struggled from her sling straps and, with Tam, Dortujla, and Suipol close behind, followed a guide to the transport lock where a\nlongrange lighter clung to its shiptit. Odrade looked at the lighter visible in bulkhead scanners. Incredibly small!\n“It’ll only be nineteen hours,” Duncan had said. “But that’s as close as we dare bring the no-ship. They’re sure to have foldspace sensors close around Junction.”\nBell, for once, had agreed. Don’t risk the ship. It’s there to plot outer defenses and receive your transmissions, not just to deliver Mother Superior. The lighter was the no-ship’s forward sensor, signaling what it encountered.\nAnd I am the foremost sensor, a fragile body with delicate instruments.\nThere were guide arrows at the lock. Odrade led the way. They went through a small tube in free-fall. She found herself in a surprisingly rich cabin. Suipol, tumbling behind, recognized it and went up a notch in Odrade’s estimation.\n“This was a smuggler ship.”\nOne person awaited them. Male by his smell but an opaque pilot’s hood bristling with connectors concealed his face.\n“Everyone strap in.”\nMale voice within that instrumentation.\nTeg chose him. He'll be the best.\nOdrade slipped into a seat behind a landing port and found the lumpy protrusions that unreeled into web harness. She heard the others obeying the pilot’s command.\n“All secure? Stay strapped in unless | say otherwise.” His voice came from a floating speaker behind his seat at the drive console.\nThe umbilicus went “Bap!” Odrade felt gentle motions, but the view in the relay beside her showed the no-ship receding at a remarkable rate. It winked out of existence.\nGoing about its business before anyone can come out to investigate.\nThe lighter had surprising speed. Scanners reported planetary stations and transition barriers at eighteen-plus hours but winking dots identifying them were visible only\nbecause they had been enhanced. A window in the scanner said the stations would be naked-eye visible in a little more than twelve of those hours.\nThe sense of motion ceased abruptly and Odrade no longer felt the acceleration her eyes reported. Suspensor cabin. Ixian technology for a nullfield this small. Where had Teg acquired it?\nNot necessary for me to know. Why tell Mother Superior where every oak plantation is located?\nShe watched sensor contacts begin within the hour and gave silent thanks for Idaho’s astuteness.\nWe're beginning to know these Honored Matres. Junction’s defensive pattern was apparent even without scanner analysis. Overlapping planes! Just as Teg predicted. With knowledge of how barriers were spaced, Teg’s people\ncould weave another globe around the planet.\nSurely it’s not that simple.\nWere Honored Matres so confident of overwhelming power that they ignored elementary precautions?\nPlanetary Station Four began calling when they were just under three hours out. “Identify yourself!”\nOdrade heard an “or else” in that command.\nThe pilot’s response obviously surprised the watchers. “You come in a little smuggler ship?”\nSo they recognize it. Teg is right once more.\n“I’m about to burn the sensor equipment in the drive,” the pilot announced. “It will add to our thrust. Make sure you're all securely harnessed.”\nStation Four noticed. “Why are you increasing velocity?”\nOdrade leaned forward. “Repeat the countersign and say our party is fatigued from too long in cramped quarters. Add that | have equipped myself with a precautionary vital-signs transmitter to alert my people should | die.”\nThey won't find the encryption! Clever Duncan. And wasn’t Bell surprised to discover what he hid in Shipsystems. “More romantics!”\nThe pilot relayed her words. Back came the order: “Reduce velocity and lock onto those coordinates for landing. We are taking over your ship control at this point.”\nThe pilot touched a yellow field on his board. “Just the way the Bashar said they would.” A gloating sound in his voice. He lifted the hood off his head and turned.\nOdrade was shocked.\nCyborg!\nThe face was a metal mask with two glittering silver balls for eyes.\nWe enter dangerous ground.\n“They didn’t tell you?” he asked. “Waste no pity. | was dead and this gave me life. It’s Clairby, Mother Superior. And when | die this time, that will buy me life as a ghola.”\nDamn! We're trading in coin that may be denied us. Too late to change. And that was Teg’s plan. But... Clairby?\nThe lighter landed with a smoothness that spoke of superb control by Station Four. Odrade knew the moment because a manicured landscape visible in her scanner no longer moved. The nullfield was turned off and she felt gravity. The hatch directly in front of her opened. Temperature pleasantly warm. Noise out there. Children playing some competitive game?\nLuggage floating behind, she stepped onto a short flight of steps and saw that the noise did indeed come from a large group of children in a nearby field. In their high teens and female. They were butting a suspensor float-ball back and forth, shouting and screaming as they played.\nStaged for our benefit?\nOdrade thought it likely. There probably were two thousand young women on that field.\nLook how many recruits we have coming along!\nNo one to greet her but Odrade saw a familiar structure down a paved lane to her left. Obvious Spacing Guild artifact with a recent tower added. She spoke of the tower as she glanced around her, giving the implaned transmitter\ndata on a change from Teg’s groundplan.
