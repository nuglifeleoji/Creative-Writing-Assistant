He is known for his loyalty and counsel, particularly in the context of the tumultuous political landscape of the time. As an advisor to Liu Zhang, he played a significant role in the strategies concerning military campaigns and the potential dangers posed by rival factions, including Liu Bei and Cao Cao.\n\n张松 conspired with Liu Bei, which ultimately led to his execution by Liu Zhang for treason.
