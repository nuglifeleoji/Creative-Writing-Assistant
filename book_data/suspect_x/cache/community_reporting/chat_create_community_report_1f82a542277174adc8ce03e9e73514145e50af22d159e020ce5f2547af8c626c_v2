Initially known only by the alias \"\"FRIEND,\"\" her true identity is later revealed by Leto to be Nayla, a trusted follower. This revelation ties her previous role as an enigmatic evaluator to her broader significance within Leto's inner circle. As Nayla, she continues to operate under Leto's command, embodying both secrecy and loyalty in her duties. The dual identity underscores her transition from a mysterious observer to a named and pivotal figure in Leto's plans.  \n\nThe descriptions, while seemingly distinct, are complementary: the first establishes her function and appearance (a masked servant evaluating Duncan), while the second clarifies her identity (Nayla) and her connection to Leto. Together, they paint a coherent picture of a character who begins as an anonymous agent but is later unveiled as a key player in Leto's regime. No contradictions exist; the second description simply expands on the first by providing her true name and contextualizing her role further.  \n\nIn summary, **FRIEND (Nayla)** is a loyal operative of Leto II, initially concealed behind a mask and tasked with monitoring Duncan Idaho, whose true identity is disclosed to Duncan by Leto himself, linking her covert role to her deeper narrative purpose.\",2\n1396,NUNEPI,Nunepi is the Tleilaxu Ambassador who is publicly flogged by Leto for spreading lies and demonstrating the God Emperor's displeasure with the Tleilaxu>,4\n1280,NAYLA,\"**Summary of Nayla:**  \n\nNayla is a complex and multifaceted Fish Speaker, a warrior class fiercely loyal to the God Emperor Leto II. She serves in multiple capacities, often embodying contradictions in her roles and allegiances. Physically, she is a muscular woman with closely cropped blonde hair, described as brutish and reminiscent of Beast Rabban, yet she is also a disciplined and precise operative.  \n\nAssigned as an escort and guardian to Siona and Duncan Idaho at Tuono Village, Nayla outwardly appears devoted to Siona, even earning her trust as a trusted aide in rebel activities. However, her true allegiance lies with Leto, for whom she acts as a spy, reporting to Moneo and monitoring Siona and Idaho. She carries a crysknife from Stilgar’s household as a talisman and wields a lasgun, tools that underscore her dual role as both protector and enforcer.  \n\nNayla is fanatically obedient to Leto, executing his commands without hesitation, including secret missions and delivering messages. Yet, she exhibits moments of conflict, particularly when following Siona’s orders, which sometimes clash with her loyalty to the God Emperor. Her brutality is evident in actions like administering excessive flogging to Nunepi, showcasing her unwavering adherence to Leto’s will.  \n\nDespite her loyalty to Leto, Nayla influences Siona’s perceptions, particularly in fostering distrust toward Topri. Her relationship with Duncan Idaho is marked by tension; he views her with suspicion, and their dynamic culminates in violence when she kills Hwi, leading to her own death at Idaho’s hands.  \n\nIn summary, Nayla is a paradoxical figure—simultaneously a devoted Fish Speaker, a ruthless enforcer, and a covert operative. Her strength, loyalty, and internal conflicts make her a pivotal yet tragic character in the unfolding power struggles surrounding Leto II, Siona, and Duncan Idaho.\",23\n1334,CRYSKNIFE CEREMONY,\"The crysknife ceremony is an old Fremen ritual where Leto gifts Nayla a crysknife, binding her to him.
