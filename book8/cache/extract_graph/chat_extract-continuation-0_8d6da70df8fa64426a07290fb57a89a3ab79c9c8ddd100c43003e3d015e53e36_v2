站在后台，主办方的工作人员们都已经彻底傻眼了，原本他们都已经绝望了，一场演唱会，演员离开了近一个小时的时间，这可是数万人的场地啊！一旦失控，后果不堪设想。他们根本就没想过在这种情况下还能圆回来，主办方已经完全乱了阵脚，可就在这时，乐公子归来，他只用了一首歌就把整个局面完全扭转。事实上，这场演唱会他一共也就唱了一首半啊！这种奇葩演唱会在联邦有史以来恐怕都是第一次。但人家就是成功了，瞬间力挽狂澜，不但解决了歌迷的骚动，甚至还让歌迷们感激涕零，以庄子建为首的主办方现在只想说一句：什么鬼？\n\n    别说主办方了，就连乐卿灵此时都震惊的无与伦比。\n\n    新歌，他竟然出新歌了。刚刚的失踪，是为了去写新歌吗？如果是这样的话，那一切就说得通了啊！\n\n    太好听了，真的是太好听了，这是一首充满了希望的新歌。而且，似乎在结束之后，新歌还给歌迷们带来了一句口号，一句只属于乐公子的口号。\n\n    守护时光守护你，多美啊！这么多歌迷都要守护乐公子的吗？\n\n

有些痛苦的皱起眉头，唐乐怎么都想不明白这是因为什么，自己自从醒转过来之后，就一直记不起以前的事情了，难道说，那个孩子和自己有什么关系吗？\n\n    “唐乐，太棒了，你知道吗？歌迷们都要为你疯狂了。今天这首新歌真的是太棒了。大家都高喊守护时光守护你呢。”乐卿灵兴冲冲的冲了过来。\n\n
