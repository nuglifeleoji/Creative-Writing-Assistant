\n　　她二妈说：“快走吧！你刘阿姨让你到她家里去吃饭，她没来过你们学校，我陪她来找你，结果宿舍没人，旁边一位女老师说看见你到这里来了……” \n　　“快走！尝尝阿姨的手艺怎样！你没到过我们家，怕你认生，我让你二妈也陪你去！”向前妈用领导人那种不容置疑的口气对她说。 \n　　田润叶太为难了！她为什么要去一个外人家吃一顿毫无理由的饭呢？但这样两个人找到这地方来请她，她怎么又能一口拒绝了呢？她要是拒绝了，叫这两个有身份的长辈怎么样下台？她还再在她二妈家的门上呆不呆了？ \n　　啊啊！人活一生，风雨雷电和寒霜雨雪，有时候会在同一个时辰向你的头上倾倒下来！ \n　　可怜的润叶没有办法，心里反对着这件事，可两条腿已经跟着她们起身了。 \n　　归根结底，她不敢伤这两个人的脸。她要是给她们难堪，带来的后果她现在都无法全部想象得来。 \n　　她一路象一只羊羔般跟着她们走，心里想：我去他们家吃一顿饭，难道就成他们家的人了吗？再说，刘阿姨和她二妈，李叔叔和她二爸，都是老同事，谁家的人到另外一家去吃个饭，这都是一件很普通的事……她走着，心中竭力找一些正常的理由来冲淡这次明显不正常的赴会……三个人进了向前家，李登云父子俩立刻热情地迎接了她们。向前慌忙解掉腰里的围裙——显然刚在厨房忙毕，接着便给她和她二妈倒茶，两只手抖得把茶水倒了一桌子。他妈眼疾手快，抓来一块抹布就揩桌子。向前红着脸退回了厨房。李登云乐呵呵地坐在她们对面，对她二妈说：“我不如你们福军，文武双全！我只会吃，不会做！家里来个客人，都是我们向前炒菜，他比他妈的手艺还高一截！” \n　　李主任似乎无意但实际有意把儿子夸赞了一番。伶俐的刘阿姨接上丈夫的话碴，说：“人各有所长嘛！向前干活心灵，可人家润叶这娃娃爱学习，一晚上熬夜把眼睛都看肿了！” \n　　“爱学习好！”李登云说，“爱云你大概知道，你爸常指教我们说，好好学习，书念到肚子里沤不烂！” \n　　徐大夫笑着说：“可他自己连一本书也不看！”“那也不能那样说！徐老把社会这本书念精通了！这可是一本大书啊！”管政工宣传的李主任不管怎样说，都让人感觉到他说的有道理。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
