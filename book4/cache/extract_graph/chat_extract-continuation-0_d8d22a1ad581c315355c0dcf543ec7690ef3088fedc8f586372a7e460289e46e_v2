批出现在公众面前的是他们的亲戚。王满银全家人都从罐子村赶来，专门参加他们家的这场光荣活动。满银拉着狗蛋的手，兰花拉着猫蛋的手，一家四口人穿戴得象过节一样来到人群里。和他们一块相跟的是秀莲他爸贺耀宗、姐夫常有林——他们倒不是专门为此而来。他们是来看望生病的秀莲却正好碰上了这件喜庆事。 \n　　现在，孙玉厚老汉也出了门，他脸上倒看不出特别的激动和愉快。这个活动他非去不行——这是儿子出钱为孙家几代买来的荣耀啊！不用说，老汉今天将是村中最受尊重的老者。少安他妈去不了，她要留下照看生病的少安他奶。另外，她把小孙女燕子也抱过来了——儿子和儿媳是今天这场大戏的主角，他们要双双出门。 \n　　在孙少安家里，秀莲和少安还在为穿衣服的事亲切而友好地拌嘴。 \n　　生病很长时间而显得有些瘦弱的秀莲，今天情绪格外地好。她已经细心地把自己打扮穿戴得象新媳妇一样。我们知道，秀莲结婚时是多么硒惶。她似乎说过，等光景闹好了，还要和亲爱的丈夫举行一次象样的“结婚仪式”。那么，秀莲，你的愿望在今天实现了！ \n　　秀莲精心地打扮完自己后，坚持要少安把最好的衣服穿上。少安本来对二爸将事情闹得如此铺排而心烦意乱，根本不愿再穿一身新衣服去显能。他已经够荣耀了，何必再用衣服去表现自己的浅薄呢？他在某种程度上已对人生有了新的理解——这是生活不断教育的自然结果。但他不能不迁就亲爱的妻子。为了不使生病的秀莲生气，他只得换了一身新衣服。他让秀莲先走一步，但秀莲坚持要和他相跟着一块出门——这可是一次最荣耀的露脸呀！当我们的秀莲和丈夫一块相跟着出现在村民们面前的时候，他内心骄傲的程度也许与南希·里根无差别……上午九点多钟，一行小汽车鱼贯相随从南头的公路上开过来，一摆溜停在了原大队部下边的路边上。锣鼓唢呐立刻响成一片，秧歌队在田五的带领下手舞足蹈，应声而起。 \n　　我们看见，第一个从小车中走出的是年轻的县委书记武惠良——他去年就从黄原来这里上任了。乡县有关部门的领导都纷纷走下车来。新成立的黄原电视台的几位记者一下车，就扛着摄像机乱跑着忙开了。 \n　　在乡县领导中我们熟悉的人有：县乡镇企业局局长徐治功——该同志双水村的老百姓也很熟悉；本乡乡长刘根民，副乡长杨高\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
