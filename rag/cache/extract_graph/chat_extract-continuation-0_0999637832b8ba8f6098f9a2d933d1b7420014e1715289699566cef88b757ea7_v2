The growing heat of the day had begun pulling the north wind out of these protected latitudes. The wind painted a false sky full of ochre plumes and sheets of crystal, strange designs in rushing gold and red. High and cold, the wind broke against the Shield Wall with fountains of dust.\nPaul felt Chani’s warmth beside him. Momentarily, he lowered a curtain of forgetfulness across his vision. He might just be standing here with his eyes closed. Time refused to stand still for him, though. He inhaled darkness— starless, tearless. His affliction dissolved substance until all that remained was astonishment at the way sounds condensed his universe. Everything around him leaned on his lonely sense of hearing, falling back only when he touched objects: the drapery, Chani’s hand. . . He caught himself listening for Chani’s breaths.\nWhere was the insecurity of things that were only probable? he asked himself. His mind carried such a burden\nof mutilated memories. For every instant of reality there existed countless projections, things fated never to be. An invisible self within him remembered the false pasts, their burden threatening at times to overwhelm the present.\nChani leaned against his arm.\nHe felt his body through her touch: dead flesh carried by time eddies. He reeked of memories that had glimpsed eternity. To see eternity was to be exposed to eternity’s whims, oppressed by endless dimensions. The oracle’s false immortality demanded retribution: Past and Future became simultaneous.\nOnce more, the vision arose from its black pit, locked onto him. It was his eyes. It moved his muscles. It guided him into the next moment, the next hour, the next day... until he felt himself to be always there!\n“It’s time we were going,” Chani said. “The Council...”\n“Alia will be there to stand in my place.”\n“Does she know what to do?”\n“She knows.”\nAlia’s day began with a guard squadron swarming into the parade yard below her quarters. She stared down at a scene of frantic confusion, clamorous and intimidating babble. The scene became intelligible only when she recognized the prisoner they’d brought: Korba, the Panegyrist.\nShe made her morning toilet, moving occasionally to the window, keeping watch on the progress of impatience down there. Her gaze kept straying to Korba. She tried to remember him as the rough and bearded commander of the third wave in the battle of Arrakeen. It was impossible. Korba had become an immaculate fop dressed now ina Parato silk robe of exquisite cut. It lay open to the waist, revealing a beautifully laundered ruff and embroidered undercoat set with green gems. A purple belt gathered the waist. The sleeves poking through the robe’s armhole slits had been tailored into rivulet ridges of dark green and black velvet.\nA few Naibs had come out to observe the treatment accorded a fellow Fremen. They’d brought on the clamor, exciting Korba to protest his innocence. Alia moved her gaze across the Fremen faces, trying to recapture memories of the original men. The present blotted out the past. They’d all become hedonists, samplers of pleasures most men couldn’t even imagine.\nTheir uneasy glances, she saw, strayed often to the doorway into the chamber where they would meet. They were thinking of Muad’Dib’s blind-sight, a new manifestation of mysterious powers. By their law, a blind man should be abandoned in the desert, his water given up to Shai-hulud. But eyeless Muad’Dib saw them. They disliked buildings, too, and felt vulnerable in space built above the ground. Give them a proper cave cut from rock, then they could relax—but not here, not with this new Muad’Dib waiting inside.\nAs she turned to go down to the meeting, she saw the letter where she'd left it on a table by the door: the latest message from their mother. Despite the special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul’s birth, the Lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj.\n“No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history,” she’d written, “but | cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion.”\nAlia touched the letter, experienced an odd sensation of mutual contact. This paper had been in her mother’s hands. Such an archaic device, the letter—but personal in a way no recording could achieve. Written in the Atreides battle tongue, it represented an almost invulnerable privacy of communication.\nThinking of her mother afflicted Alia with the usual inward blurring. The spice change that had mixed the psyches of mother and daughter forced her at times to think of Paul as a son to whom she had given birth. The capsule-complex of\noneness could present her own father as a lover. Ghost shadows cavorted in her mind, people of possibility.\nAlia reviewed the letter as she walked down the ramp to the antechamber where her guard amazons waited.\n“You produce a deadly paradox,” Jessica had written. “Government cannot be religious and self-assertive at the same time. Religious experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress. And you cannot govern without laws. Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience, replace even the religion by which you think to govern. Sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality. Government, on the other hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions and contentions. | see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replaces morality.”\nThe smell of spice-coffee greeted Alia in the antechamber. Four guard amazons in green watch-robes came to attention as she entered. They fell into step behind her, striding firmly in the bravado of their youth, eyes alert for trouble. They had zealot faces untouched by awe. They radiated that special Fremen quality of violence: they could kill casually with no sense of guilt.\nIn this, | am different, Alia thought. The Atreides name has enough dirt on it without that.\nWord preceded her. A waiting page darted off as she entered the lower hall, running to summon the full guard detail. The hall stretched out windowless and gloomy, illuminated only by a few subdued glowglobes. Abruptly, the doors to the parade yard opened wide at the far end to admit a glaring shaft of daylight. The guard with Korba in their midst wavered into view from the outside with the light behind them.\n“Where is Stilgar?” Alia demanded.\n“Already inside,” one of her amazons said.\nAlia led the way into the chamber. It was one of the Keep’s more pretentious meeting places. A high balcony with rows of soft seats occupied one side. Across from the balcony, orange draperies had been pulled back from tall windows. Bright sunlight poured through from an open space with a garden and a fountain. At the near end of the chamber on her right stood a dais with a single massive chair.\nMoving to the chair, Alia glanced back and up, saw the gallery filled with Naibs.\nHousehold guardsmen packed the open space beneath the gallery, Stilgar moving among them with a quiet word here, a command there. He gave no sign that he’d seen Alia enter.\nKorba was brought in, seated at a low table with cushions beside it on the chamber floor below the dais. Despite his finery, the Panegyrist gave the appearance now of a Surly, sleepy old man huddled up in his robes as against the outer cold. Two guardsmen took up positions behind him.\nStilgar approached the dais as Alia seated herself.\n“Where is Muad’Dib?” he asked.\n“My brother has delegated me to preside as Reverend Mother,” Alia said.\nHearing this, the Naibs in the gallery began raising their voices in protest.\n“Silence!” Alia commanded. In the abrupt quiet, she said: “Is it not Fremen law that a Reverend Mother presides when life and death are at issue?”\nAs the gravity of her statement penetrated, stillness came over the Naibs, but Alia marked angry stares across the rows of faces. She named them in her mind for discussion in Council—Hobars, Rajifiri, Tasmin, Saajid, Umbu, Legg ... The names carried pieces of Dune in them: Umbu Sietch, Tasmin Sink, Hobars Gap...\nShe turned her attention to Korba.\nObserving her attention, Korba lifted his chin, said: “1 protest my innocence.”\n“Stilgar, read the charges,” Alia said.\nStilgar produced a brown spicepaper scroll, stepped forward. He began reading, a solemn flourish in his voice as though to hidden rhythms. He gave the words an incisive quality, clear and full of probity:\n“that you did conspire with traitors to accomplish the destruction of our Lord and Emperor; that you did meet in vile secrecy with diverse enemies of the realm; that you...”\nKorba kept shaking his head with a look of pained anger.\nAlia listened broodingly, chin planted on her left fist, head cocked to that side, the other arm extended along the chair arm. Bits of the formal procedure began dropping out of her awareness, screened by her own feelings of disquiet.\n“venerable tradition ... support of the legions and all Fremen everywhere ... violence met with violence according to the Law... majesty of the Imperial Person... forfeit all rights to...”\nIt was nonsense, she thought. Nonsense! All of it— nonsense ... nonsense ... nonsense...\nStilgar finished: “Thus the issue is brought to judgment.”\nIn the immediate silence, Korba rocked forward, hands gripping his knees, veined neck stretched as though he were preparing to leap. His tongue flicked between his teeth as he spoke.\n“Not by word or deed have | been traitor to my Fremen vows! | demand to confront my accuser!”\nA simple enough protest, Alia thought.\nAnd she saw that it had produced a considerable effect on the Naibs. They knew Korba. He was one of them. To become a Naib, he’d proved his Fremen courage and caution. Not brilliant, Korba, but reliable. Not one to lead a Jihad, perhaps, but a good choice as supply officer. Not a\ncrusader, but one who cherished the old Fremen virtues: The Tribe is paramount.\nOtheym’s bitter words as Paul had recited them swept through Alia’s mind. She scanned the gallery. Any of those men might see himself in Korba’s place—some for good reason. But an innocent Naib was as dangerous as a guilty one here.\nKorba felt it, too. “Who accuses me?” he demanded. “l have a Fremen right to confront my accuser.”\n“Perhaps you accuse yourself,” Alia said.\nBefore he could mask it, mystical terror lay briefly on Korba’s face. It was there for anyone to read: With her powers, Alia had but to accuse him herself, saying she brought the evidence from the shadow region, the alam al- mythal.\n“Our enemies have Fremen allies,” Alia pressed. “Water traps have been destroyed, qanats blasted, plantings poisoned and storage basins plundered...”\n“And now—they’ve stolen a worm from the desert, taken it to another world!”\nThe voice of this intrusion was known to all of the m— Muad’Dib. Paul came through the doorway from the hall, pressed through\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a desert-dwelling people with a strong cultural identity and strict codes of conduct, including the maxim 'Never to forgive—never to forget.'\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul, also known as Muad'Dib, is a blind leader with mysterious powers and a central figure in Fremen society.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Chani is a Fremen woman who is close to Paul, providing him with warmth and support.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is Paul's sister, a Reverend Mother with significant influence and responsibilities in Fremen society.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KORBA<|>PERSON<|>Korba is a Fremen Naib and Panegyrist, accused of treason and brought before the council for judgment.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen leader who assists in the proceedings against Korba and maintains order among the guards.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Lady Jessica is the mother of Paul and Alia, a Bene Gesserit with significant influence and a complex relationship with her children.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIELD WALL<|>GEO<|>The Shield Wall is a geographical feature in the desert, acting as a barrier against the wind and dust.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKEEN<|>GEO<|>Arrakeen is a location where significant battles have taken place, including the battle in which Korba participated.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is the birthplace of Paul and a place of special reverence, though Lady Jessica refuses to make it a stop on the hajj.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNCIL<|>EVENT<|>The Council is a gathering where important decisions are made, including the judgment of Korba.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAJJ<|>EVENT<|>The hajj is a pilgrimage, which Lady Jessica refuses to allow Caladan to be a part of.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CHANI<|>Paul and Chani share a close personal relationship, with Chani providing him comfort and support.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>ALIA<|>Paul and Alia are siblings, with Alia often standing in for Paul in official capacities.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>KORBA<|>Alia presides over the judgment of Korba, who is accused of treason.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>LADY JESSICA<|>Alia and Lady Jessica share a complex mother-daughter relationship, influenced by the spice change.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KORBA<|>STILGAR<|>Korba is brought before Stilgar, who reads the charges against him.<|>4\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>FREMEN<|>Paul is a central figure in Fremen society, with significant influence and power.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>FREMEN<|>Alia holds a position of authority among the Fremen, presiding over important decisions.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY JESSICA<|>CALADAN<|>Lady Jessica refuses to allow Caladan to become a stop on the hajj, despite its significance.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KORBA<|>ARRAKEEN<|>Korba participated in the battle of Arrakeen, a significant event in his past.<|>4\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
