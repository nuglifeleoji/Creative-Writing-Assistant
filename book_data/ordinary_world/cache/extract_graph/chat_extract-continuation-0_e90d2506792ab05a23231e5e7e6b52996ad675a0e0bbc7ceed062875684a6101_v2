我是高一〈２〉班的，听润生说过咱村还来了两个同学，都分在高一〈１〉班了，也没去认识你们。你看，我这个老乡真是太不象话了！” \n　　晓霞用一口标准的普通话连笑带说。她的性格很开朗，一看就知道人家是见过大世面的人！少平同时发现，田晓霞外面的衫子竟然象男生一样披着，这使他感到无比惊讶。 \n　　他立在脚地上，仍然紧张得火烧火燎。等润叶把他的碗筷送到厨房重新返回来的时候，他赶快对她说：“姐，没什么事我就走呀……” \n　　润叶大概也看出了他的窘迫，笑着说：“我还没跟你说话呢！” \n　　少平这才想起，润叶姐不光是叫他来吃饭的，她还有事要给他说哩！ \n　　润叶姐看来很理解他的难处，马上又说：“那好，我去送送你，咱们路上再说。” \n　　“喝点水再走吧！”晓霞把水杯往他面前挪了挪。“我不渴！”他象农民一样笨拙地说。 \n　　晓霞露出两排白牙齿笑了，说：“那我这杯水算是给你白倒了！” \n　　少平立刻意识到这是一句略带揶揄意味的玩笑话。这种玩笑话实际上是一种亲切的表示。不过，这却使他更拘束了，竟然满脸通红，无言对答。 \n　　晓霞看他这样难为情，赶忙笑着给他点了点头，就出去了。 \n　　他于是就和润叶姐相跟着起身回学校去。 \n　　当他们走到县革委会大门口的时候，迎面碰上了回家的田主任。少平认识润叶她二爸——他有时路过常回村子里来。“你还没吃饭哩？”润叶问她二爸。 \n　　“刚开完会……”这位县领导五官很象他哥田福堂，只是头发背梳着，脸面也比他哥和善多了。 \n　　“这是谁家的娃娃？”田主任指着他问润叶。 \n　　“这就是咱村少安他弟弟嘛！也是今年才上的高中……”润叶说。 \n　　“噢……孙玉厚的二小子！都长这么大了。和你爸一样，大个子！……是不是和晓霞一个班？他扭头问润叶。 \n　　“和晓霞不一个班，和润生是一个班。”润叶回答他。“咱村里还有谁家的娃娃来上高中了？”田主任又问少平。少平拘束地抠着手指头，说：“还有金波。” \n　　“金波？他的娃娃……” \n　　少平头“轰”地响了一声，知道他回答问题不准确。润叶嘿嘿笑了，赶忙对二爸说：“金波是金俊海的小子。”田主任也笑了，说：“噢噢，俊海在地区运输公司开车……天这么黑了，到家里吃饭去嘛！”他招呼少平说。润叶说：“已经吃过了。我去送送他！” \n　　“那好。常来啊……”田主任竟然伸出了手要和少平握手。
