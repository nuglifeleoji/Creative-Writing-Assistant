枪入寨之时，只叫得一声苦，连人带马，跌在陷坑里。陈泰兵从后面杀来，郭淮从左边杀来，羌兵大乱，自相践踏，死者无数，生者尽降。俄何烧戈自刎而死。郭淮、陈泰引兵直杀到羌人寨中，迷当大王急出帐上马时，被魏兵生擒活捉，来见郭淮。淮慌下马，亲去其缚，用好言抚慰曰：“朝廷素以公为忠义，今何故助蜀人也？”迷当惭愧伏罪。淮乃说迷当曰：“公今为前部，去解铁笼山之围，退了蜀兵，吾奏准天子，自有厚赐。”\n\n    迷当从之，遂引羌兵在前，魏兵在后，径奔铁笼山。时值三更，先令人报知姜维。维大喜，教请入相见。魏兵多半杂在羌人部内；行到蜀寨前，维令大兵皆在寨外屯扎，迷当引百余人到中军帐前。姜维、夏侯霸二人出迎。魏将不等迷当开言，就从背后杀将起来。维大惊，急上马而走。羌、魏之兵，一齐杀入。蜀兵四分五落，各自逃生。维手无器械，腰间止有一副弓箭，走得慌忙，箭皆落了，只有空壶。维望山中而走，背后郭淮引兵赶来；见维手无寸铁，乃骤马挺枪追之。看看至近，维虚拽弓弦，连响十余次。淮连躲数番，不见箭到，知维无箭，乃挂住钢枪，拈弓搭箭射之。维急闪过，顺手接了，就扣在弓弦上；待淮追近，望面门上尽力射去，淮应弦落马。维勒回马来杀郭淮，魏军骤至。维下手不及，只掣得淮枪而去。魏兵不敢追赶，急救淮归寨，拔出箭头，血流不止而死。司马昭下山引兵追赶，半途而回。夏侯霸随后逃至，与姜维一齐奔走。维折了许多人马，一路收扎不住，自回汉中。虽然兵败，却射死郭淮，杀死徐质，挫动魏国之威，将功补罪。却说司马昭犒劳羌兵，发遣回国去讫，班师还洛阳，与兄司马师专制朝权，群臣莫敢不服。魏主曹芳每见师入朝，战栗不已，如针刺背。一日，芳设朝，见师带剑上殿，慌忙下榻迎之。师笑曰：“岂有君迎臣之礼也，请陛下稳便。”须臾，群臣奏事，司马师俱自剖断，并不启奏魏主。少时朝退，师昂然下殿，乘车出内，前遮后拥，不下数千人马。\n\n
