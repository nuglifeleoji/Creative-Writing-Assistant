\n　　孙少平坐在低矮的长条铁凳上，和一群新老工人挤在一起。学习室烟雾大罩。新工人都瞪大眼睛惊恐地听雷区长讲话。老工人们谁也不听，正抓紧时间在下井前过烟瘾；他们一边抽烟，一边说笑，屋子里一片嗡嗡声。 \n　　雷区长从前面一个老工人手里要过一支带嘴纸烟，点着吸了几口，然后让区队办事员点新工人的名字。点到谁，谁就站起来答个到。 \n　　点完名，雷区长继续讲话。 \n　　“……世事不一样了，你们的名字也和我们这些隔辈人叫得不一样！什么文军，少平，永生……永生是叫对了！来煤矿都想活，还没叫短命的。有没有结过婚的？站起来！”有两三个新工人红着脸从人堆里立起来。 \n　　“嘿嘿，娃娃们，你们想老婆的日子在后边哩！” \n　　学习室“嗡”一声都笑了。那几个结过婚的新工人赶忙坐在铁凳上，低倾下头。“不要紧，等挣下两个票票，土崖上戳几个窑窑，就把你们的花骨朵接来吧……我还要说第二点……” \n　　雷区长正要往下说，有几个老工人已经站起来，走过去在区长的光头上不恭敬地摸了摸，说：“对了，不要再放屁了！” \n　　雷区长咧开大嘴笑着，从台子上退下来。会议也随之结束了。 \n　　这就是煤矿生活最初的一课。 \n　　在以后紧接着的日子里，矿上先组织新工人集中学习，由矿上和区队的工程师、技术员，分别讲井下的生产和安全常识。另外，工会还来全面介绍了这个矿的情况。十天以后，他们第一次下井参观。 \n　　这一天，新工人们都有点莫名地激动。在此之前，他们的工作衣、作衣箱和矿灯都已经分好了。 \n　　在浴池换衣服的作衣柜前，大伙说笑着穿上了簇新的蓝色的工作服，脖项里围上了雪白的毛巾。每个人的屁股上都吊着电池盒子，矿灯明晃晃地别在钢盔似的矿帽上。就象新演员第一次出台，有的人甚至拿出小圆镜，端详着自己的英武风貌。一切看起来都象电影电视里的矿工一样整洁潇洒。 \n　　出现了第一件不妙的事——一律不准带烟火！尽管大家在学习时就知道了这一点，但此刻仍然有点愕然。这些人穿戴完毕，就在区队领导和安全检查员的带领下，通过连接浴池的一条长长的暗道，蜂涌着来到井口。一个老头又分别在众人身上摸一遍，看是不是有人违章带了烟火。
