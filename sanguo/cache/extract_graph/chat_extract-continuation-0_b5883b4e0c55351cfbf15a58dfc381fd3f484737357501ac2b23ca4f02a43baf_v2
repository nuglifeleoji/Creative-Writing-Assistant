��知祢衡受害，笑曰：“腐儒舌剑，反自杀矣！”因不见刘表来降，便欲兴兵问罪。荀彧谏曰：“袁绍未平，刘备未灭，而欲用兵江汉，是犹舍心腹而顺手足也。可先灭袁绍，后灭刘备，江汉可一扫而平矣。”操从之。\n\n    且说董承自刘玄德去后，日夜与王子服等商议，无计可施。建安五年，元旦朝贺，见曹操骄横愈甚，感愤成疾。帝知国舅染病，令随朝太医前去医治。此医乃洛阳人，姓吉，名太，字称平，人皆呼为吉平，当时名医也。平到董承府用药调治，旦夕不离；常见董承长吁短叹，不敢动问。\n\n    时值元宵，吉平辞去，承留住，二人共饮。饮至更余，承觉困倦，就和衣而睡。忽报王子服等四人至，承出接入。服曰：“大事谐矣！”承曰：“愿闻其说。”服曰：“刘表结连袁绍，起兵五十万，共分十路杀来。马腾结连韩遂，起西凉军七十二万，从北杀来。曹操尽起许昌兵马，分头迎敌，城中空虚。若聚五家僮仆，可得千余人。乘今夜府中大宴，庆赏元宵，将府围住，突入杀之。不可失此机会！”承大喜，即唤家奴各人收拾兵器，自己披挂绰枪上马，约会都在内门前相会，同时进兵。夜至二鼓，众兵皆到。董承手提宝剑，徒步直入，见操设宴后堂，大叫：“操贼休走！”一剑剁去，随手而倒。霎时觉来，乃南柯一梦，口中犹骂“操贼”不止。\n\n    吉平向前叫曰：“汝欲害曹公乎？”承惊惧不能答。吉平曰：“国舅休慌。某虽医人，未尝忘汉。某连日见国舅嗟叹，不敢动问。恰才梦中之言，已见真情，幸勿相瞒。倘有用某之处，虽灭九族，亦无后悔！”承掩面而哭曰：“只恐汝非真心！”平遂咬下一指为誓。承乃取出衣带诏，令平视之；且曰：“今之谋望不成者，乃刘玄德、马腾各自去了，无计可施，因此感而成疾。”平曰：“不消诸公用心。操贼性命，只在某手中。”承问其故。平曰：“操贼常患头风，痛入骨髓；才一举发，便召某医治。如早晚有召，只用一服毒药，必然死矣，何必举刀兵乎？”承曰：“若得如此，救汉朝社稷者，皆赖君也！”时吉平辞归。承心中暗喜，步入后堂，忽见家奴秦庆童同侍妾云英在暗处私语。承大怒，唤左右捉下，欲杀之。夫人劝免其死，各人杖脊\n######################\nOutput:",
