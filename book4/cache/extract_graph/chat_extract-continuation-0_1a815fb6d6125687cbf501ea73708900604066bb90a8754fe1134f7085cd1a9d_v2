��们调了三万吨。当然……我们把所有带的名贵土特产都送给了这位女同志……”农业局长叙述完这个买化肥的“故事”后，脸通红。 \n　　“那你们从哪里弄的土特产？”田福军惊讶地问。“我们让市郊一个县农业局筹办的。说好搞到化肥以后，可以多给他们县拨一些……”农办主任说完后又尴尬地补充说：“这是我出的主意……” \n　　田福军坐在椅子里，半天不知该说什么。 \n　　是该表扬他们呢？还是批评他们？ \n　　唉，这就是我们面对的现实。就连到中央部门办点事，也得来这一套！ \n　　但他能说什么呢？不管怎样，他们今年的化肥问题已经基本解决了！ \n　　他最后只好对两个下属说：“那就尽快组织力量，把化肥及时送到基层……” \n　　农办主任和农业局长走后，田福军的心情仍然难以平静下来，在改革开放的新形势下，社会各个环节存在着许多令人忧虑的问题；而这些问题又在直接威胁和瓦解着改革本身。从宏观上来说，一个国家和民族的真正强大，不仅依赖于经济的发展，同时也应该整个地提高公民素质的水准……田福军发了一会愣，又叹了一口气，便在文件堆积如山的办公桌前坐下来，准备处理一些紧急事务。这时候，却听见有人又在敲门。 \n　　他极不乐意地打开门，却惊讶而高兴地看见，他过去多年共事的冯世宽笑呵呵地从门外走进来了。 \n　　他有点激动地握住了世宽的手，问：“刚到？”“昨天到的。一个钟头后就得起飞！” \n　　“往北还是往南？” \n　　“当然只能是往南罗！” \n　　“那么说，你就要去上任了？” \n　　“省委催的紧嘛，黄原那面刚办完手续，就赶下来了。”“世宽，你的担子不轻松啊！” \n　　田福军亲切地拉冯世宽坐进沙发，喊叫通讯员弄来两杯茶水。 \n　　高凤阁被撤销了南部那个地区的专员职务后，省委就任命冯世宽去那里当行署专员。在省委常委会上，田福军竭力推荐冯世宽出任那个地区的行政首脑。为重建这座被水毁灭的城市，中央拨了几亿人民币。这样一大笔钱，需要一个认真负责的人去使用。冯世宽是合适的，省委经过考察，便任命了他。 \n　　有趣的是，高凤阁和冯世宽都是从黄原提拔到那里去任专员。这两个人过去又都曾反对过田福军。田福军并没有因世宽过去和他闹过别扭，就对他存有偏见；我们知道，他们在黄原时就已合作得很好了……“连一顿饭也顾不上吃？”田福军遗撼地问世宽。“没时间了！我抽点空就是来看看你。你们可得要好好支援我们那个地区啊！再说，你也是省委领导，我们一块共\n######################\nOutput:",
