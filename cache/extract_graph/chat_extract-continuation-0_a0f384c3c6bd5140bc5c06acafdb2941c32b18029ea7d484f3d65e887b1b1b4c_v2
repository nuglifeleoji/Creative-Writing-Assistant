Did Murbella know how she undermined his authority? Or should he take this as a measure of the importance she attached to the refugees?\nWhen the situation was secure, he turned the bay over to an aide and, riding on Streggi’s shoulders, went to see these important refugees. What was so vital about them that Murbella risked interference?\nThey were in a troop-carrier hold, a congealed party held apart by a cautious commander.\nWho knows what may be concealed among these unknowns?\nThe Rabbi, identifiable because he was being deferred to by the field commander, stood with a brown-robed woman at the near side of his people. He was a small, bearded man wearing a white skullcap. Cold light made him appear ancient. The woman shielded her eyes with a hand. The Rabbi was speaking and his words became audible as Teg approached.\nThe woman was under verbal attack!\n“The prideful one will be brought low!”\nWithout removing her hand from its defensive position, the woman said: “I am not proud of what | carry.”\n“Nor of the powers this knowledge may bring you?”\nWith knee pressure, Teg ordered Streggi to stop them about ten paces away. His commander glanced at Teg but stayed in position, ready to act defensively if this should prove to be a diversion.\nGood man.\nThe woman bent her head even lower and pressed her hand against her eyes when she spoke. “Are we not offered knowledge that we might use it in holy service?”\n“Daughter!” The Rabbi held himself stiffly erect. “Whatever we may learn that we may better serve, it never can be a great thing. All we call knowledge, were it to encompass everything a humble heart could hold, all of that would be no more than one seed in the furrows.”\nTeg felt reluctant to interfere. What an archaic way of speaking. This pair fascinated him. The other refugees listened to the exchange with rapt attention. Only Teg’s field commander appeared aloof, keeping his attention on the strangers and giving an occasional hand-signal to aides.\nThe woman kept her head respectfully lowered and the Shielding hand in place but she still defended herself. “Even\na seed lost in the furrows may bring forth life.”\nThe Rabbi's lips tightened into a grim line, then: “Without water and care, which is to say, without the blessing and the word, there is no life.”\nA great sigh shook the woman’s shoulders but she held herself in that oddly submissive position when she responded: “Rabbi, | hear and obey. Still, | must honor this knowledge that has been thrust upon me because it contains the very admonition you have just voiced.”\nThe Rabbi placed a hand on her shoulder. “Then convey it to those who want it and may no evil enter where you go.”\nSilence told Teg the argument had ended. He urged Streggi forward. Before she could move, Murbella strode past and nodded to the Rabbi while keeping her gaze on the woman.\n“In the name of the Bene Gesserit and our debt to you, | welcome you and give you sanctuary,” Murbella said.\nThe brown-robed woman lowered her hand and Teg saw contact lenses glittering in the palm. She lifted her head then and there were gasps all around. The woman’s eyes were the total blue of spice addiction but they also held that inner force marking one who had survived the Agony.\nMurbella made instant identification. A wild Reverend Mother! Not since Dune’s Fremen days had one of these been known.\nThe woman curtsied to Murbella. “I am called Rebecca. And | am filled with joy to be with you. The Rabbi thinks | am a silly goose but I have a golden egg for | carry Lampadas: seven million six hundred twenty-two thousand and fourteen Reverend Mothers and they are rightfully yours.”\nAnswers are a perilous grip on the universe. They can appear sensible yet explain nothing.\n—THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\ns the wait for their promised escort lengthened, Odrade\nbecame first angry and then amused. Finally, she began following lobby robos, interfering with their movements. Most were small and none appeared humanoid.\nFunctional. Hallmark of Ixian servos. Busy, busy, busy little accompaniments to a sojourn at Junction or its equivalent anywhere.\nThey were so commonplace that few people noticed them. Since they were not capable of dealing with deliberate interference, they subsided into motionless humming.\n“Honored Matres have little or no sense of humor.” | know, Murbella. | know. But do they get my message?\nDortujla obviously did. She came out of her funk and watched these antics with a wide grin. Tam looked disapproving but tolerant. Suipol was delighted. Odrade had to restrain her from helping to immobilize the devices.\nLet me do the antagonizing, child. | know what is in store for me.\nWhen she was sure she had made her point, Odrade took a position under one of the chandeliers.\n“Attend me, Tam,” she said.\nTamalane obediently placed herself in front of Odrade with an attentive expression.\n“Have you noticed, Tam, that modern lobbies tend to be quite small?”\nTamalane spared a glance for her surroundings.\n“Lobbies once were large,” Odrade said. “To provide a prestigious feeling of space for the powerful, and impressing others with your importance, of course.”\nTamalane caught the spirit of Odrade’s playlet and said: “These days you’re important if you travel at all.”\nOdrade looked at the immobilized robos scattered across the lobby floor. Some hummed and jittered. Others waited quietly for someone or some thing to restore order.\nThe autoreceptionist, a phallic tube of black plaz with a single glittering comeye, came out from behind its cage and picked its way through the stalled robos to confront Odrade.\n“Much too humid today.” It had a soupy feminine voice. “Don’t know what Weather is thinking of.”\nOdrade spoke past it to Tamalane. “Why do they have to program these mechanicals to simulate friendly humans?”\n“It’s obscene,” Tamalane agreed. She forcibly shouldered the autoreceptionist aside and it swiveled to study the source of this intrusion but made no other move.\nOdrade was suddenly aware she had touched on the force that had powered the Butlerian Jinhad—mob motivation.\nMy own prejudice!\nShe studied the mechanical confronting them. Was it waiting for instructions or must she address the thing directly?\nFour more robos entered the lobby and Odrade recognized her party’s luggage piled on them.\nAll of our things carefully inspected, I’m sure. Search where you will. We carry no hint of our legions.\nThe four scurried along the edge of the room and found their passage blocked by the ones rendered motionless. The luggage robos stopped and waited for this unique state of affairs to be sorted out. Odrade smiled at them. “There go the signs of the transient concealing our secret selves.”\nConcealing and secret.\nWords to annoy the watchers.\nCome on, Tam! You know the ploy. Confuse that enormous content of unconsciousness, arouse feelings of guilt they will be incapable of recognizing. Give them the jitters the way | did with the robos. Make them wary. What are the real powers of these Bene Gesserit witches?\nTamalane took her cue. Transients and secret selves. She explained for the comeyes in tones one used with children. “What do you carry when you leave your nest? Are you one who tries to pack it all? Or do you prune to necessities?”\nWhat would the watchers classify as necessities? Tools of hygiene and washable or replaceable clothing? Weapons? They sought those in our luggage. But Reverend Mothers tend not to carry visible weapons.\n“What an ugly place this is,” Dortujla said, joining Tamalane in front of Odrade and picking up on the drama. “You would almost think it deliberate.”\nAhhh, you nasty watchers. Observe Dortujla. Remember her? Why has she returned when she must know what you might do to her? Food for Futars? See how little that concerns her?\n“A transition point, Dortujla,” Odrade said. “Most people would never want this as their destination. An inconvenience, and the small discomforts serve only to remind you of that.”\n“A wayside stop, and it will never be much more unless they completely rebuild,” Dortujla said.\nWould they hear? Odrade aimed a look of utter composure at the selected comeye.\nThis is ugliness that betrays intent. It says to us: “We will provide something for the stomach, a bed, a place to evacuate bladder and bowels, a place to conduct the little maintenance rituals flesh requires, but you will be gone quickly because all we really want is the energy you leave behind.”\nThe autoreceptionist backed around Tamalane and Dortujla, once more trying to make contact with Odrade.\n“You will send us to our quarters immediately!” Odrade said, glaring into the cyclopean eye.\n“Dear me! We’ve been inconsiderate.”\nWhere had they found that syrupy voice? Repulsive. But Odrade was on her way out of the lobby in less than a minute, luggage on its robos ahead of them, Suipol close behind, Tamalane and Dortujla following.\nThere was an air of neglect to one wing clearly visible as they passed it. Did that mean Junction’s traffic had declined? Interesting. Shutters had been sealed along an entire corridor. Hiding something? In the resulting gloom she detected dust on floor and ledges with only a few tracks of maintenance mechs. Concealment of what lay outside those windows? Unlikely. This had been closed off for some time.\nShe detected a pattern in what was being maintained. Very little traffic. Honored Matre effect. Who dared move around much when it felt safer to dig in and pray you would not be noticed by dangerous prowlers? Access lanes to elite private quarters were being kept up. Only the best was being maintained at its best.\nWhen Gammu’s refugees arrive, there will be room.\nIn the lobby, a robo had handed Suipol a guide pulser. “To find your way later.” Round blue ball with a yellow arrow floating in it to point your chosen way. “Rings a tiny bell when you arrive.”\nThe pulser’s tiny bell rang.\nAnd where have we arrived?\nAnother place where their hosts had provided “every luxury” while keeping it repellent. Rooms with soft yellow floors, pale mauve walls, white ceilings. No chairdogs. Be thankful for that even though the absence spoke of economics rather than care for a guest’s preferences. Chairdogs required sustenance and expensive staff. She saw furnishings with permaflox fabrics. And behind the fabrics She felt plastic resilience. Everything done in the other colors of the rooms.\nThe bed was a small shock. Someone had taken the request for a hard mat too literally. Flat surface of black plaz without cushion. No bedding.\nSuipol, seeing this, started to object but Odrade silenced her. Despite Bene Gesserit resources, comfort sometimes fell by the wayside. Get the job done! That was their first order. If Mother Superior had to sleep occasionally on a hard surface without covers, this could be passed off in the name of duty. Besides, the Bene Gesserit had ways of adjusting to such inconsequentials. Odrade steeled herself to discomfort, aware that if she objected she might find another deliberate insult.\nLet them add this to all of that unconscious content and worry about it.\nHer summons came while she was inspecting the rest of their\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a Bene Gesserit leader who orchestrates the rescue and sanctuary of refugees, including a wild Reverend Mother named Rebecca.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a military commander who oversees the security of the refugees and interacts with Murbella and the Rabbi.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBI<|>PERSON<|>The Rabbi is a religious leader among the refugees, engaged in a theological debate with Rebecca.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REBECCA<|>PERSON<|>Rebecca is a wild Reverend Mother with spice-addicted eyes, carrying knowledge of Lampadas and its Reverend Mothers.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREGGI<|>PERSON<|>Streggi is a subordinate who carries Teg on her shoulders and follows his commands.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood offering sanctuary and wielding political influence, led by Murbella.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMPADAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lampadas is referenced as a place or group associated with 7,622,014 Reverend Mothers, now under Bene Gesserit control.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a rival faction to the Bene Gesserit, known for their lack of humor and oppressive tactics.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location in Tiruzia where hostages like Samuel Namara were held.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNCTION<|>GEO<|>Junction is a transit hub with neglected facilities, reflecting the Honored Matres' influence.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is the origin of refugees expected to arrive at Junction.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The Agony is a transformative ordeal survived by Reverend Mothers, marking their ascension.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>The Butlerian Jihad was a historical uprising against thinking machines, referenced in the context of mob motivation.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Murbella leads the Bene Gesserit and makes key decisions like offering sanctuary.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REBECCA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Rebecca is a wild Reverend Mother now under Bene Gesserit protection.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REBECCA<|>LAMPADAS<|>Rebecca carries knowledge of Lampadas' Reverend Mothers.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>MURBELLA<|>Teg follows Murbella's orders regarding refugee security.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RABBI<|>REBECCA<|>The Rabbi debates Rebecca's possession of forbidden knowledge.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres are rival factions.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit leader strategizing against the Honored Matres.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>JUNCTION<|>Odrade critiques Junction's neglected state as a reflection of Honored Matre rule.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAMMU<|>JUNCTION<|>Refugees from Gammu are expected to arrive at Junction.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
