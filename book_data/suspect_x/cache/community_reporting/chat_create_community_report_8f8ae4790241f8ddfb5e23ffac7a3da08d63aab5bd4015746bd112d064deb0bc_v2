Led by the cunning and oppressive **Baron Vladimir Harkonnen**, the Harkonnens are sworn enemies of the Atreides, responsible for orchestrating the attack on **Arrakis**, the death of **Duke Leto Atreides**, and the capture of **Jessica and Paul Atreides**. Their seat of power is **Giedi Prime**, though they also ruled **Arrakis** with an iron fist, exploiting its resources—particularly the valuable spice—and oppressing the native **Fremen**, whom they frequently clashed with.  \n\nThe Harkonnens are known for their military prowess, employing advanced weaponry like **lasguns** and mercenaries, sometimes disguised as Fremen, to further their schemes. Their cruelty extends beyond warfare; they are infamous for their oppressive governance, conducting raids, and eliminating threats such as **Liet-Kynes**. Their influence persists even in later eras, as remnants of their legacy linger in places like **Gammu** and the **no-globe**.  \n\nHistorically, the Harkonnens have been a dominant force in imperial politics, engaging in vendettas, betrayals, and manipulations to secure power, including ambitions for the imperial throne. Key figures like **Feyd-Rautha** exemplify their ruthless nature. Their enmity with the Atreides is deeply personal, rooted in blood feuds and strategic rivalries, making them central antagonists in the conflicts surrounding **Arrakis** and the rise of **Muad'Dib**.
