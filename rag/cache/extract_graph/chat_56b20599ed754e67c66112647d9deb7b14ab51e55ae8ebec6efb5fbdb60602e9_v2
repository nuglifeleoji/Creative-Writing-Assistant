Jus’ once, we’re gonna do th’ thing my way.\n“After you drink this,” Yueh said. “It’s just caffeine.”\n“\"Sprolly like all res’ uh this place! Damn’ sun ’stoo brighd. Nothin’ has uh righd color. Ever’thing’s wrong Ofiri”\n”\n“Well, it’s nighttime now,” Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. “Drink this like a good lad. It'll make you feel better.”\n“Don’ wanna feel bedder!”\n“We can’t argue with him all night,” Jessica said. And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.\n“There’s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,” Yueh said. “I can take care of this.”\nJessica shook her head. She stepped forward, Slapped Idaho sharply across the cheek.\nHe stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.\n“This is no way to act in your Duke’s home,” she said. She snatched the cup from Yueh’s hands, Spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. “Now drink this! That’s an order!”\nIdaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with careful and precise enunciation: “I do not take orders from a damn’ Harkonnen spy.”\nYueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.\nHer face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her—the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze flickering.\nThey were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!\nShe shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.\n“You knew this?” she demanded.\n“l,..heard rumors, my Lady. But | didn’t want to add to your burdens.”\n“Hawat!” she snapped. “I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!”\n“But, my Lady....”\n“Immediately!”\nIt has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately.\nIdaho shook his head, mumbled. “Chuck th’ whole damn thing.”\nJessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents across Idaho’s face. “Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing,” she ordered. “Let him sleep it off.”\nThe two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: “Perhaps we should take him someplace else, m’Lady. We could....”\n“He’s supposed to be here!” Jessica snapped. “He has a job to do here.” Her voice dripped bitterness. “He’s so good at watching the ladies.”\nThe guard swallowed.\n“Do you know where the Duke is?” she demanded.\n“He’s at the command post, my Lady.”\n“Is Hawat with him?”\n“Hawat’s in the city, my Lady.”\n“You will bring Hawat to me at once,” Jessica said. “I will be in my sitting room when he arrives.”\n“But, my Lady....”\n“If necessary, | will call the Duke,” she said. “I hope it will not be necessary. | would not want to disturb him with this.”\n“Yes, my Lady.”\nJessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes’ hands, met the questioning stare of the blue-within-blue eyes. “You may return to bed, Mapes.”\n“You're sure you'll not need me?”\nJessica smiled grimly. “I’m sure.”\n“Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow,” Yueh said. “I could give you a sedative and....”\n“You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,” she said. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. “This is the only Way.”\nAbruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her rooms. Cold walls... passages...a familiar door.... She jerked the door open, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the shield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought? We shall see.\nJessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once more, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight\nchairs along the wall, the two low tables, her stand- mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.\nPale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat down in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair’s regal heaviness for this occasion.\nNow, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating patience, saving her strength.\nSooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at her command.\nShe watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath. Hawat’s rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the room’s light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm.\nShe smelled blood there.\nJessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: “Bring that chair and sit facing me.”\nHawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He studied Jessica’s face, wondering how he could save this situation.\n“It’s long past time to clear the air between us,” Jessica said.\n“What troubles my Lady?” He sat down, placed hands on knees.\n“Don’t play coy with me!” she snapped. “If Yueh didn’t tell you why | summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at least that honest with each other?”\n“As you wish, my Lady.”\n“First, you will answer me one question,” she said. “Are you now a Harkonnen agent?”\nHawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: “You dare insult me so?”\n“Sit down,” she said. “You insulted me so.”\nSlowly, he sank back into the chair.\nAnd Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed herself a deep breath. /t isn’t Hawat.\n“Now | know you remain loyal to my Duke,” she said. “I’m prepared, therefore, to forgive your affront to me.”\n“Is there something to forgive?”\nJessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the Duke’s daughter I’ve carried within me these few weeks? No...Leto himself doesn’t know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when he must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.\n“A Truthsayer would solve this,” she said, “but we have no Truthsayer qualified by the High Board.”\n“AS you say. We've no Truthsayer.”\n“Is there a traitor among us?” she asked. “I’ve Studied our people with great care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It’s not you, Thufir. It cannot be Paul. | know it’s not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him in and put him to the test?”\n“You know that’s an empty gesture,” Hawat said. “He’s conditioned by the High College. That | know\nfor certain.”\n“Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit Slain by the Harkonnens,” Jessica said.\n“So that’s what happened to her,” Hawat said.\n“Haven't you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?”\n“You know | don’t have the ear,” Hawat said.\n“What brought this base suspicion on me?” she asked.\nHawat frowned. “My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first loyalty is to the Duke.” “I’m prepared to forgive much because of that\nloyalty,” she said.\n“And again | must ask: Is there something to forgive?”\n“Stalemate?” she asked.\nHe shrugged.\n“Let us discuss something else for a minute, then,” she said. “Duncan Idaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer. | hear reports that others among our people have been Stupefied by this concoction. Is that true?”\n“You have your reports, my Lady.”\n“So | do. Don’t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?”\n“My Lady speaks riddles.”\n“Apply your Mentat abilities to it!” she snapped. “What’s the problem with Duncan and the others? | can tell you in four words—they have no home.”\nHe jabbed a finger at the floor. “Arrakis, that’s their home.”\n“Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we’ve uprooted them. They have no home. And they fear the Duke’s failing them.”\nHe stiffened. “Such talk from one of the men would be cause for—”\n“Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.”\n“The Duke gives me charge over such matters.”\n“But you understand | have a certain natural concern over the progress of this disease,” she said. “And perhaps you'll grant | have certain abilities along these lines.”\nWill I have to shock him severely? she wondered. He needs shaking up—something to break him from routine.\n“There could be many interpretations for your concern,” Hawat said. He shrugged.\n“Then you've already convicted me?”\n“Of course not, my Lady. But | cannot afford to take any chances, the situation being what it is.”\n“A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,” she said. “Who took that chance?”\nHis face darkened. “I offered my resignation to the Duke.”\n“Did you offer your resignation to me...or to Paul?”\nNow he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.\n“I’m the Duke’s man,” he said, biting off the words.\n“There is no traitor,” she said. “The threat’s something else. Perhaps it has to do with the lasguns. Perhaps they'll risk secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they’ll....”\n“And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn’t atomic?” he asked. “No, my Lady. They'll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers. The evidence is hard to erase. No. They'll observe most of the forms. It has to be a traitor.”\n“You're the Duke’s man\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_56b20599ed754e67c66112647d9deb7b14ab51e55ae8ebec6efb5fbdb60602e9_v2"}
