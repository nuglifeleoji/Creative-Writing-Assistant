It was under threat from Cao Cao's advancing troops, which led 刘备 to contemplate abandoning the city to ensure the safety of his people. The city was besieged multiple times, notably during the military campaigns involving notable generals such as 云长 (Guan Yu) and 曹仁 (Cao Ren). Reports indicate that 樊城 was under siege from 云长's forces, which were overwhelming, and it served as a defensive stronghold for 曹仁 against these attacks.\n\n樊城 was also a site of significant military victories, including a notable triumph for 刘备, which underscored its importance in the power struggles of the era. The city was a strategic location targeted by various military leaders, including 孙坚 (Sun Jian), who engaged in battles there. It served as a military stronghold and a place of refuge, where strategies were devised against enemy forces.\n\nThe city was not only a battleground but also a location where troop movements were closely monitored. 曹操's forces were stationed in 樊城 to observe 刘备's movements, highlighting its strategic value in the broader context of the Three Kingdoms conflicts. The ongoing military actions and the presence of reinforcements from the Wei army further complicated the situation, as 樊城 became a critical point of contention between the opposing forces.\n\nIn summary, 樊城 is a city marked by its strategic significance during the Three Kingdoms period, characterized by its involvement in numerous military campaigns, sieges, and battles.
