These colossal Guild ships are essential for facilitating travel and trade across the universe, functioning as the major carriers within the Guild’s transportation network. Heighliners rely on **melange-fueled Navigators** to safely traverse the vast distances of space, making them indispensable for interstellar travel.  \n\nWhile primarily used for commercial and logistical purposes, Heighliners have also been employed for specific high-profile missions, such as transporting the remains of **Duncan Idaho** to the **Tleilaxu**. The Guild maintains strict neutrality in all operations, ensuring that Heighliners remain impartial conduits for travel and transport, regardless of political or factional conflicts.  \n\nDescriptions of Heighliners consistently emphasize their immense size, Guild ownership, and critical role in enabling interstellar mobility. Whether for cargo, passengers, or specialized deliveries, these ships are the backbone of the Spacing Guild’s infrastructure, underpinning the economic and social connectivity of the known universe.\",5\n156,HARVESTER FACTORY,\"The **Harvester Factory** is a large, mobile mining unit designed to extract the valuable spice known as melange from the sands of Arrakis. A critical component of the spice trade, it operates primarily on rich, uncontaminated spice deposits, often referred to as \"\"blows.\"\" These massive machines, sometimes called \"\"crawlers,\"\" are essential for efficiently gathering melange, a resource of immense economic and strategic importance.  \n\nFunctioning as both a mining and processing facility, the Harvester Factory traverses the desert landscape, sifting through the sand to collect spice while filtering out contaminants. Its mobility allows it to relocate to new spice-rich areas as needed, maximizing yield. Due to the harsh conditions of Arrakis and the ever-present threat of sandworms, Harvester Factories are heavily fortified and equipped with defensive measures to protect both the machinery and the crew operating it.  \n\nIn summary, the Harvester Factory is a vital industrial asset on Arrakis, enabling large-scale spice extraction and playing a central role in sustaining the interstellar spice trade. Its dual function as a mobile mining and processing unit makes it indispensable for harvesting melange efficiently and safely from the planet's treacherous desert environment.\",4\n157,CARRYALL,\"The **CARRYALL** is a large aircraft designed for heavy transport operations, primarily used to move harvester factories across spice-rich desert terrains.
