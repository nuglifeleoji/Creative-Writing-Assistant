It is frequently mentioned in relation to **hostage exchanges**, **Fremen justice**, and **political detainment**, often symbolizing oppression and control.  \n\nWhile some descriptions suggest it may have been associated with **Harkonnen operations**, **Sardaukar control**, or **Tleilaxu captivity**, the most consistent detail is its role in confining prisoners like Samuel Namara, indicating its significance in broader geopolitical conflicts. The prison is referenced in **ancestral memories**, **Mentat analyses**, and **Bene Gesserit reports**, reinforcing its notoriety.  \n\nThough a few descriptions ambiguously place Alhamia Prison on **Gammu** or under **Honored Matre** jurisdiction, the overwhelming consensus identifies it as a **Tiruzian facility**. Contradictions about its exact affiliation (Harkonnen, Sardaukar, or Tleilaxu) are likely due to shifting control across timelines, but its core function as a harsh detention center remains unchanged.  \n\nIn summary, **Alhamia Prison** is a key location in Tiruzia, infamous for imprisoning figures like Samuel Namara and serving as a recurring symbol of captivity in the *Dune* saga. Its mentions span **Fremen conflicts**, **hostage negotiations**, and **historical records**, solidifying its role as a site of confinement and power struggles.
