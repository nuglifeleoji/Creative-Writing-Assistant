�了握手，就向人群中走去了。此刻，两个村的秧歌队已经扭到了庙坪，向金家湾小学院子那里涌去。东拉河和哭咽河两岸到处都挤满了狂欢的人群…… \n　　孙少安站在小土坡上，用手飞快地卷起了一支旱烟卷。他抽着烟，久久望着欢腾的村庄和隆冬中的山野——再过半月就是惊蛰；那时一声响雷，大地就要解冻啦！ \n　　准备：１９８２年－１９８５年 \n　　第一稿：１９８５年秋天—冬天 \n　　第二稿：１９８６年春天—夏天 \n                  第二部 第1章\n　　黑色的新式“伏尔加”小轿车在茫茫的春雨中穿过绿色海洋般的中部平原，由北往南，向省城飞驰而行，车轮在积水的柏油路面溅起一溜白雾。黄土高原边缘地带的冲积阶地和两级台原，象一抹荒凉的海岸线消失在了北方遥远的天边。透过车窗，从辽阔的平原上望过去，南方巍峨的横断山脉渐渐出现在视野之内。一列列钢蓝色的山峦象大海中的舰队一般威严；突兀的峰巅之上，隐约可以了见那白皑皑的积雪。 \n　　小汽车在奔驰。绿色。还是绿色。无边的绿色中，有时会闪过一片绯红或一方金黄——那是大片返青的麦田中盛开的桃花和油菜花。温暖的春天从中国的南方走来，开始用生命的原色装饰北方的大地了。 \n　　绿色中飞驰的小车急速绕过一个抛物线似的大弯道，把弧线内一座巨大的化工厂甩在后面，重新转入笔直的路面，在平原上继续向南飞奔。道路两旁晃过一排排青杨绿柳，那枝叶被雨水洗得油光鲜亮；成对的燕子翻着低掠过雾气腾腾的麦田，用它黑色灵巧的剪刀裁剪密麻麻的雨丝……乔伯年沉默地坐在车内，对原野上的一派春光并不特别在意。他不是诗人，也不是游客，看来无心观赏这撩拨人的飞红流绿。 \n　　实际上，在这个头发斑白的人眼里，此刻车窗外依次出现的只是内陆省的三种截然不同的地貌。北方那消失了的一抹黄色，就是荒凉的黄土高原。那里沟壑纵横，土地被流水切割得支离破碎，面积却要占全省版图的百分之四十五。这季节那里仍然是一望无际的荒凉——他出生在那里，闭住眼也能看见故乡一年四季的景象。 \n　　展现在眼前的这几百里绿色平原，当然是全省的“白菜心”了。这块肥得流油的土地，也曾经是中国历史上的“白菜心”——散布在平原上那一个个小山似的古代帝王的坟冢就是证明。不过，对于全省来说，这块风水\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
