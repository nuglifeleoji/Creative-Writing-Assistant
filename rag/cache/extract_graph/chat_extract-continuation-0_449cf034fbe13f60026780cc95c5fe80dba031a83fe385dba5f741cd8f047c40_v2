What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over more land.”\nWhat is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She said: “Stilgar, | underestimated you.”\n“Such was my suspicion,” he said.\n“Each of us apparently underestimated the other,” she said.\n“I should like an end to this,” he said. “I should like friendship with you...and trust. | should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.”\n“I understand,” she said.\n“Do you trust me?”\n“| hear your sincerity.”\n“Among us,” he said, “the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders, hold a special place of honor. They teach. They maintain the strength of God here.” He touched his breast.\nNow I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery, She thought. And she said: “You spoke of your Reverend Mother...and I’ve heard words of legend and prophecy.”\n“It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our future,” he said.\n“Do you believe | am that one?”\nShe watched his face, thinking: The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings are times of such great peril.\n“We do not know,” he said.\nShe nodded, thinking: He’s an honorable man. He wants a sign from me, but he'll not tip fate by telling me the sign.\nJessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows, the purple shadows, the vibrations of dust-mote air across the lip of their cave. Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence. She knew the cant of the Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear and hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes here...as though someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria Protectiva’s imprint.\nStilgar cleared his throat.\nShe sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to seal off this opening. This was a time for boldness on her part, and she realized what she needed: some dar al- hikman, some school of translation that would give her....\n“Adab,” she whispered.\nHer mind felt as though it had rolled over within her. She recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse. Nothing in all the Bene Gesserit training carried such a signal of recognition. It could be only the adab, the demanding memory that comes upon you of itself. She gave herself up to it, allowing the words to flow from her.\n“Ibn qgirtaiba,” she said, “as far as the spot where the dust ends.” She stretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgar’s eyes go wide. She heard a\nrustling of many robes in the background. “I see a... Fremen with the book of examples,” she intoned. “He reads to al-Lat, the sun whom he defied and subjugated. He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads:\n“Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down That did stand in the path of the tempest.\nHast thou not seen what our Lord did?\nHe sent the pestilence among them\nThat did lay schemes against us.\nThey are like birds scattered by the huntsman. Their schemes are like pellets of poison\nThat every mouth rejects.”\nA trembling passed through her. She dropped her arm.\nBack to her from the inner cave’s shadows came a whispered response of many voices: “Their works have been overturned.”\n“The fire of God mount over thy heart,” she said. And she thought: Now, it goes in the proper channel. “The fire of God set alight,” came the response.\nShe nodded. “Thine enemies shall fall,” she said.\n“Bi-la kaifa,” they answered.\nIn the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her. “Sayyadina,” he said. “If the Shai-hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to become a Reverend Mother.”\nPass within, she thought. An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it fitted into the cant well enough. And She felt a cynical bitterness at what she had done. Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was\nprepared for us in this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place. Now...! must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God...Sayyadina to rogue peoples who’ve been so heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they even call their Chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.\nPaul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave. He could still taste the morsel she had fed him—bird flesh and grain bound with spice honey and encased in a leaf. In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten such a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear. He knew what this essence could do to him—the spice change that pushed his mind into prescient awareness.\n“Bi-la kaifa,” Chani whispered.\nHe looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept his mother’s words. Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand aloof from the ceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.\n“Duy yakha hin mange,” Chani whispered. “Duy punra hin mange. | have two eyes. | have two feet.”\nAnd she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.\nPaul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him. His mother’s words had locked onto the working of the spice essence, and he had felt her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire. Through it all, he had sensed the edge of cynicism in her—he knew her so well!—but nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food.\nTerrible purpose!\nHe sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape. There was the sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of his awareness. He sank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it. Awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing the available paths, the winds of the future...the winds of the past: the one-eyed vision of the past, the one-eyed vision of the present and the one-eyed vision of the future—all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to see time-become-space.\nThere was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto his awareness of the present, sensing the blurred deflection of experience, the flowing moment, the continual solidification of that- which-is into the perpetual-was.\nIn grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of time’s movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges, and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs. It gave him a new understanding of his prescience, and he saw the source of blind time, the source of error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.\nThe prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealed—at once a source of accuracy and meaningful error. A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.\nAnd what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—the wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.\nThe vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.\nThe countless consequences—lines fanned out from this cave, and along most of these consequence-lines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a gaping knife wound.\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg’s black helmet with the Imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though. When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but | often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. | think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nof Fremen around her, smelling the acrid stillsuit odor. Her inner timesense told her it would soon be night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space. She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this\n] essica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir\nsuggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within Stilgar’s troop. She turned in the hammock that had been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots.\nI must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit’s pumping action, she thought. There are so many things to remember.\nShe could still taste their morning meal—the morsel of bird flesh and grain bound within a leaf with spice honey—and it came to her that the use of time was turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of rest.\nNight conceals; night is safest.\nShe unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with the fabric in the dark until she found the top, slipped into it.\nHow to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit? she wondered. They would have to be told of the two Strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.\nGlowglobes came alight farther into the cave. She Saw people moving there, Paul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the aquiline Atreides profile.\nHe had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought. Withdrawn. He was like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his eyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare. It made her think of his warning about the spice-impregnated diet: addictive.\nAre there side effects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with his prescient faculty, but he\nhas been strangely silent about what he sees.\nStilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat-stalking look of him.\nAbrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around Paul—the stiff movements, the ritual positions.\n“They have my countenance!” Stilgar rumbled.\nJessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted— Jamis! She saw then the rage in Jamis—the tight set of his shoulders.\nJamis, the man Paul bested! she thought.\n“You know the rule, Stilgar,” Jamis said\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen leader who seeks friendship and trust with Jessica, and holds a special place of honor among the Sayyadina.
