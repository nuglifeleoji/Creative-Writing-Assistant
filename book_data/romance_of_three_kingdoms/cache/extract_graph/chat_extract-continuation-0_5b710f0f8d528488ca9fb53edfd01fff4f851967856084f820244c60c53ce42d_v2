   费诗方出王旨，令云长领兵取樊城。云长领命，即时便差傅士仁、糜芳二人为先锋，先引一军于荆州城外屯扎；一面设宴城中，款待费诗。饮至二更，忽报城外寨中火起。云长急披挂上马，出城看时，乃是傅士仁、糜芳饮酒，帐后遗火，烧着火炮，满营撼动，把军器粮草，尽皆烧毁。云长引兵救扑，至四更方才火灭。云长入城，召傅士仁、糜芳责之曰：“吾令汝二人作先锋，不曾出师，先将许多军器粮草烧毁，火炮打死本部军人。如此误事，要你二人何用？”叱令斩之。费诗告曰：“未曾出师，先斩大将，于军不利。可暂免其罪。”云长怒气不息，叱二人曰：“吾不看费司马之面，必斩汝二人之首！”乃唤武士各杖四十，摘去先锋印绶，罚糜芳守南郡，傅士仁守公安；且曰：“若吾得胜回来之日，稍有差池，二罪俱罚！”二人满面羞惭，喏喏而去。\n\n

且说关公是日祭了“帅”字大旗，假寐于帐中。忽见一猪，其大如牛，浑身黑色，奔入帐中，径咬云长之足。云长大怒，急拔剑斩之，声如裂帛。霎然惊觉，乃是一梦。便觉左足阴阴疼痛，心中大疑。唤关平至，以梦告之。平对曰：“猪亦有龙象。龙附足，乃升腾之意，不必疑忌。”云长聚多官于帐下，告以梦兆。或\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
