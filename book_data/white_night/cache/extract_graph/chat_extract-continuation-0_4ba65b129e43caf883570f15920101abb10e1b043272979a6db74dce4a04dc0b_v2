“要有礼貌。”蓝潇眉头微蹙。\n\n    蓝轩宇吐了吐舌头，这才从娜娜怀中滑落。\n\n    南澄此时也走了出来，看到娜娜同样惊讶，和丈夫对视一眼，“冕下，您吃过早餐了吗？”\n\n    娜娜愣了一下，事实上，她其实对饥饿并没有谁什么感觉，甚至平时都很少吃东西。\n\n    看她的表情，南澄赶忙道：“那就一起吃吧，我刚做好了早餐。”\n\n    “好。”\n\n    或许是因为娜娜的到来，小轩宇这顿早餐吃的格外香甜，娜娜吃的很少，看着身边的轩宇大口、大口的吃着，那狼吞虎咽的模样不禁让她的眼神中多了几分迷惘。不知道为什么，她总觉得这一幕很熟悉，似乎是在很久远的曾经，应该是看到过得。\n\n    “这小家伙最近越来越能吃了。冕下，这会不会不正常？”当着一位封号斗罗，南澄忍不住问道。\n\n    娜娜摇摇头，道：“没关系的。吃应该是因为他的身体需要营养，需要能量来帮助自身的成长。不过，普通的食物中蕴含的能量终究是有限的。”\n\n    蓝潇心中一动，“您说的是，那些药膳和珍稀食材？”\n\n    “嗯。那些会好很多，对身体比较滋补。”娜娜说道。\n\n    蓝潇苦笑一下，“我们还真没这个条件。我也只是听说过。高等学院好像才有药膳的配额。”\n\n    娜娜看了他一眼，道：“高等学院有吗？为什么呢？”\n\n    蓝潇道：“药膳价值高昂，尤其是那些珍稀食材，更不是普通人能吃得起的。据说只有高等学院的精英班级才有一些搭配，但也需要自己花钱买。像我们这些普通人，连买的资格都没有。联邦对珍稀食材的管控非常严格。最好的珍稀食材只有母星和两颗魂兽星才有。单是运送成本就是很大的数字了。”\n\n    “哦。紫萝城有高等学院么？”娜娜问道。\n\n    蓝潇道：“有几所。魂师高等学院却只有一所，天罗高等魂师学院紫萝城分院。轩宇现在上的是他们的附属初级学院。”\n\n    “哦，我知道了。”娜娜点了点头。\n\n    南澄道：“冕下，您真的准备教轩宇吗？让您教他真的是太大材小用了。而且，我们确实是负担不起费用。”别说是他们这种中上层次的家庭，就算是那些很有钱的富人，恐怕也请不起一位封号斗罗做家庭老师。唯有大家族或者财团才有可能。\n\n
