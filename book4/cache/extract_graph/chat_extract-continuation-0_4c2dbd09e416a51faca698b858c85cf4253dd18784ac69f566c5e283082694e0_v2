\n　　只有田二是个例外。“半脑壳”今天不捡别的，光捡枣子。他一边嘴里嚼着枣子，一边手里把捡起的枣子往他前襟上的那两个大口袋里塞着；这两个塞满枣子的大口装吊在他胸前，象个袋鼠似的，累得他都走不干练了。他一边捡，一边吃，一边嘿嘿笑着，还没忘了嘟囔说：“世事要变了……” \n　　人们还发现，连爱红火的老家伙田万有也能俏得爬到枣树上去了！他拿一根五短三粗的磨棍；一边打枣，一边嘴里还唱着信天游，把《打樱桃》随心所欲地改成了《打红枣》——太阳下来丈二高，小小（的呀）竹竿扛起就跑，哎噫哟！叫一声妹妹呀，咱们快来打红枣……地上的妇女们立刻向枣树上的田万有喊道：“田五，亮开嗓子唱！”爱耍笑的金俊文的老婆张桂兰还喊叫说：“来个酸的！” \n　　田五的兴致来了，索性把磨棍往树杈上一横，仰起头，眯起眼，嘴巴咧了多大，放开声唱开了——叫一声干妹子张桂兰，你爱个酸来我就来个酸！ \n　　绿格铮铮清油炒鸡蛋，笑格嘻嘻干妹子你硷畔上站；绒格墩墩褥子软格溜溜毡，不如你干妹子胳膊弯里绵……妇女们都笑得前伏后仰，张桂兰朝树上笑骂道：“把你个挨刀子的……” \n　　田五咧开嘴正准备继续往下唱，可马上又把脸往旁边一扭，拿起磨棍只管没命地打起枣来，再不言传了——他猛然看见，他儿媳妇银花正在不远的枣树下捡枣哩！年轻的儿媳妇臊得连头也抬不起来。 \n　　众人马上发现田五为啥不唱了，于是一边继续起哄，一边快乐地仰起头，朝枣树上面秋天的蓝空哈哈大笑了——啊呀，这比酸歌都让人开心！田五满脸通红——唉，要不是儿媳妇在场，他今天可能把酸歌唱美哩！只要银花不在，就是他儿子海民在他也不在乎！ \n　　他儿子田海民现在正和书记田福堂、副书记金俊山几个人在河对面一队的禾场上——那里已经堆起了一堆小山一样的枣子。两个生产队的队长少安和俊武也在那里。几个队干部正在过斤称，大队会计田海民旁边记数字。枣子打完后，就要在这里给各家各户往开分了。 \n　　孙玉亭在庙坪这面负责。他不上树，在地上和妇女们一块捡枣，大部分时间要跑前跑后吆喝着\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田二<|>PERSON<|>田二 is a character in the village who is
