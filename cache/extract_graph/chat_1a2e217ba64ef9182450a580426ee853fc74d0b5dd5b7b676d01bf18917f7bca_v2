A shower of small stones and Sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.\nPaul crowded his mother farther back.\nCinnamon!\nThe smell of it flooded across him.\nWhat has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice.\n“Barrrroooom!”\nIt was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.\nAgain: “Barrrroooom!”\nThe worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes.\n“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”\nAnother thumper! Paul thought.\nAgain it sounded off to their right.\nA shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand. Only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of a tunnel rearing above the dunes.\nSand rasped.\nThe creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes.\nPaul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons.\nJessica followed, listening: “Lump...lump...lump... lump...lump....”\nPresently the sound stopped.\nPaul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.\nJessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the aftermath of terror. “Has it gone for sure?” she whispered.\n“Somebody called it,” Paul said. “Fremen.”\nShe felt herself recovering. “It was so big!”\n“Not as as big as the one that got our ’thopter.”\n“Are you Sure it was Fremen?”\n“They used a thumper.”\n“Why would they help us?”\n“Maybe they weren’t helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm.”\n“Why?”\nAn answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come. He had a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks in their packs—the “maker hooks.”\n“Why would they call a worm?” Jessica asked.\nA breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from his mother, to look up the cliff. “We'd better find a way up there before daylight.” He pointed. “Those poles we passed—there are more of them.”\nShe looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles—wind-scratched markers—made out the Shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high above them.\n“They mark a way up the cliff,” Paul said. He settled his shoulders into the pack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward.\nJessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.\nUp they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.\nPaul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to slow caution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched away upward, open to the stars at the top. His ears searched, found only sounds he could expect —a tiny spill of sand, an insect brrr, the patter of a Small running creature. He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock beneath a gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for his mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her around.\nThey looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement. “If we could only risk a light,” he whispered.\n“We have other senses than eyes,” she said.\nPaul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other foot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled himself up onto it. He reached back, felt his mother’s arm, tugged at her robe for her to follow.\nAnother step.\n“It goes on up to the top, | think,” he whispered.\nShallow and even steps, Jessica thought. Man- carved beyond a doubt.\nShe followed the shadowy movement of Paul’s progress, feeling out the steps. Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them. The steps\nended in a slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto a shallow, moonlit basin.\nPaul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: “What a beautiful place.”\nJessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him.\nIn spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest, this basin’s beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.\n“Like a fairyland,” Paul whispered.\nJessica nodded.\nSpreading away in front of her stretched desert growth—bushes, cacti, tiny clumps of leaves—all trembling in the moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her left, moon-frosted on her right.\n“This must be a Fremen place,” Paul said.\n“There would have to be people for this many plants to survive,” she agreed. She uncapped the tube to her stillsuit’s catchpockets, sipped at it. Warm, faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how it refreshed her. The tube’s cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it.\nMovement caught Paul’s attention—to his right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them. He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump, pop-hop of tiny motion.\n“Mice!” he hissed.\nPop-hop-hop! they went, into shadows and out.\nSomething fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice. There came a thin screech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.\nWe needed that reminder, Jessica thought.\nPaul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night. The predatory bird—he thought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a stillness to the basin so unuttered that the blue- milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbush. There was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.\n“We'd better find a place to pitch the tent,” he said. “Tomorrow we can try to find the Fremen who—” “Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!”\nIt was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the moment. The voice came from above them and to their right.\n“Please do not run, intruders,” the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into the defile. “If you run you'll only waste your body’s water.”\nThey want us for the water of our flesh! Jessica thought. Her muscles overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal. She pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: Such stealth! | didn’t hear him. And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the Small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.\nAnother voice called from the basin’s rim to their left. “Make it quick, Stil. Get their water and let’s be on our way. We've little enough time before dawn.”\nPaul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic. He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, then fall into the semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction.\nStill, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was blind time, no future he had seen...and they were caught between wild Fremen whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.\nThis Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as “The Pillars of the Universe,” whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by “The Old Man’s Hymn’?\n| drove my feet through a desert\nWhose mirage fluttered like a host.\nVoracious for glory, greedy for danger,\n| roamed the horizons of al-Kulab.\nWatching time level mountains\nIn its search and its hunger for me.\nAnd | saw the sparrows swiftly approach,\nBolder than the onrushing wolf.\nThey spread in the tree of my youth.\n| heard the flock in my branches\nAnd was caught on their beaks and claws!\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe man crawled across a dune top. He was a\nmote caught in the glare of the noon sun. He was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak, his Skin bare to the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows. Beneath the blue-within-blue\neyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks. A matted depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to catchpockets.\nThe man stopped half across the dune crest, arms stretched down the slipface. Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs. Patches of yellow- gray sand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself to his feet, stood there swaying. And even in this almost-random action there remained a trace of once-precise movement.\n“lam Liet-Kynes,” he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known. “I am His Imperial Majesty’s Planetologist,” he whispered, “planetary ecologist for Arrakis. | am steward of this land.”\nHe stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face. His hands dug feebly into the sand.\nI am steward of this sand, he thought.\nHe realized that he was semidelirious, that he should dig himself into the sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it. But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre- Spice pocket somewhere underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.\nHis hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.\nA thought spread across his mind—clear, distinct: The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization— agriculture.\nAnd he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single track, could not get off that track.
