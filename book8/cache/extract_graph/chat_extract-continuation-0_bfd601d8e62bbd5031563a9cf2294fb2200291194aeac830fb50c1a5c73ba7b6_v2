�嘿嘿一笑，“我不一样啊！你别看我武魂不靠谱，可是，我学东西特别快的呀。我精神力可是全班第一的。不然的话，你以为我是怎么被录取进来的？真的只是不靠谱的召唤啊？”\n\n    蓝轩宇一愣，“那你也是想要选斗铠师加战舰驾驶基础了？你多少精神力？”\n\n    钱磊道：“最近没测，估计有一百三、四十了吧。嘿嘿嘿。”\n\n    蓝轩宇估计自己的精神力也差不多有一百了，却没想到钱磊的精神力要比自己还高，这确实是奇葩的。高能少年班果然就没有一个普通的。\n\n    “我精神力应该也有差不多一百了，学这两门够不够？”蓝轩宇说道。\n\n    “啥？你也有一百？这么强的？双生武魂这么厉害吗？”钱磊惊讶的道，因为吃惊，所以他的声音有点大，顿时引起了老师的注意。\n\n    “你们两个，起立。”老师抬手朝着他们这边点了点。\n\n    钱磊这才意识到自己声音太大了，赶忙一把捂住嘴站了起来。\n\n    蓝轩宇也很无奈，这才来第一天，已经是第二次被老师点名了……\n\n    两人站起身，面对的是老师灼灼目光。\n\n    “你们俩有什么问题吗？这么迫不及待的就在课上讨论。”老师淡淡的说道。\n\n    钱磊和蓝轩宇对视一眼，刚要开口，却被老师抬手制止了，“你不要说，让新来的这位同学说。你叫蓝轩宇是吧？”\n\n    “是的。”蓝轩宇点点头。\n\n    看着他漂亮的大眼睛，老师严肃的表情略微舒缓了几分，“说吧，你们刚才在讨论什么？”\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“老师，我们刚才在讨论副职业选择的问题，战舰驾驶基础是否可以和斗铠兼修。钱磊说这二者兼修会消耗很大的精力，不容易学得好。但我确实二者都喜欢，我和钱磊也都想兼修它们。”\n\n    老师愣了愣，“兼修战舰驾驶基础和斗铠？”他顿时有了些兴趣，“那你们的底气何在呢？正如钱磊所说，这二者都会消耗大量的精力，而且绝不是有决心就一定能学得好的。这需要天赋和能力，缺一不可。”\n\n    钱磊忍不住道：“老师，您刚才不是说了吗？悟性和精神力正相关。我俩精神力高，所以兼修应该是可以的吧。”\n\n    老师眼睛一亮，“你们俩的精神力都已经过五十了？”\n\n    此言一出，其他高能少年班的学员们目光顿时向二人投射过来。要知道，以他们的年纪，精神力如果能过五十，可不是一件容易的事情。\n\n    “过一百了。嘿嘿。”钱磊有些嘚瑟的说道。\n\n    他在班里一向是最后一名，就是因为他那不靠谱的武魂，而精神力异于常人可以说是他最值得骄�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a student with a high spiritual
