安置。布自引军投山东兖州境上，留高顺、张辽守小沛。此时孙乾已逃出城外。关、张二人亦各自收得些人马，往山中住扎。\n\n    且说玄德匹马逃难，正行间，背后一人赶至，视之乃孙乾也。玄德曰：“吾今两弟不知存亡，妻小失散，为之奈何？”孙乾曰：“不若且投曹操，以图后计。”玄德依言，寻小路投许都。途次绝粮，尝往村中求食。但到处，闻刘豫州，皆争进饮食。一日，到一家投宿，其家一少年出拜，问其姓名，乃猎户刘安也。当下刘安闻豫州牧至，欲寻野味供食，一时不能得，乃杀其妻以食之。玄值曰：“此何肉也？”安曰：“乃狼肉也。”玄德不疑，乃饱食了一顿，天晚就宿。至晓将去，往后院取马，忽见一妇人杀于厨下，臂上肉已都割去。玄德惊问，方知昨夜食者，乃其妻之肉也。玄德不胜伤感，洒泪上马。刘安告玄德曰：“本欲相随使君，因老母在堂，未敢远行。”玄德称谢而别，取路出梁城。忽见尘头蔽日，一彪大军来到。玄德知是曹操之军，同孙乾径至中军旗下，与曹操相见，具说失沛城、散二弟、陷妻小之事。操亦为之下泪。又说刘安杀妻为食之事，操乃令孙乾以金百两往赐之。\n\n    军行至济北，夏侯渊等迎接入寨，备言兄夏侯惇损其一目，卧病未痊。操临卧处视之，令先回许都调理。一面使人打探吕布现在何处。探马回报云：“吕布与陈宫、臧霸结连泰山贼寇，共攻兖州诸郡。”操即令曹仁引三千兵打沛城；操亲提大军，与玄德来战吕布。前至山东，路近萧关，正遇泰山寇孙观、吴敦、尹礼、昌豨领兵三万余拦住去路。操令许褚迎战，四将一齐出马。许褚奋力死战，四将抵敌不住，各自败走。操乘势掩杀，追至萧关。探马飞报吕布。\n\n    时布已回徐州，欲同陈登往救小沛，令陈珪守徐州。陈登临行，珪谓之曰：“昔曹公曾言东方事尽付与汝。今布将败，可便图之。”登曰：“外面之事，儿自为之；倘布败回，父亲便请糜竺一同守城，休放布入，儿自有脱身之计。”珪曰：“布妻小在此，心腹颇多，为之奈何？”登曰：“儿亦有计了。”乃入见吕布曰：“徐州四面受敌，操必力攻，我当先思退步：可将钱粮移于下邳，倘徐州被围，下邳有粮可救。主公盍早为计？”布曰：“元龙之言甚善。吾当\n######################\nOutput:",
