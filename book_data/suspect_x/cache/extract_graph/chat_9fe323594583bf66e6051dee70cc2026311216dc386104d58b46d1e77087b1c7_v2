He’s not to be trusted. There are too many signs...”\n“I fail to see them,” she said.\nHe was suddenly angry with her denseness. “Take my word for it, mother! The signs are there; l'Il explain later.”\n“I’m afraid | must agree,” Tyekanik said.\nWensicia lapsed into hurt silence. How dared they push her out of Council like this? As though she were some light- headed fancy woman with no—\n“We mustn't forget that Idaho was once a ghola,” Farad’n said. “The Tleilaxu .. .” He glanced sidelong at Tyekanik.\n“That avenue will be explored,” Tyekanik said. He found himself admiring the way Farad’n’s mind worked: alert, questing, sharp. Yes, the Tleilaxu, in restoring life to Idaho, might have planted a powerful barb in him for their own use.\n“But | fail to apprehend a Tleilaxu motive,” Farad’n said.\n“An investment in our fortunes,” Tyekanik said. “A small insurance for future favors?”\n“Large investment, I'd call it,” Farad’n said.\n“Dangerous,” Wensicia said.\nFarad’n had to agree with her. The Lady Jessica’s Capabilities were notorious in the Empire. After all, she’d been the one who'd trained Muad’Dib.\n“If it became known that we hold her,” Farad’n said.\n“Yes, that’d be a two-edged sword,” Tyekanik said. “But it need not be known.”\n“Let us assume,” Farad’n said, “that we accept this offer. What’s her value? Can we exchange her for something of greater importance?”\n“Not openly,” Wensicia said.\n“Of course not!” He peered expectantly at Tyekanik.\n“That remains to be seen,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n nodded. “Yes. | think if we accept, we should consider the Lady Jessica as money banked for indeterminate use. After all, wealth doesn’t necessarily have to be spent on any particular thing. It’s just... potentially useful.”\n“She'd be a very dangerous captive,” Tyekanik said.\n“There is that to consider, indeed,” Farad’n said. “I’m told that her Bene Gesserit Ways permit her to manipulate a person just by the subtle employment of her voice.”\n“Or her body,” Wensicia said. “Irulan once divulged to me some of the things she’d learned. She was showing off at the time, and | saw no demonstrations. Still the evidence is pretty conclusive that Bene Gesserits have their ways of achieving their ends.”\n“Were you suggesting,” Farad’n asked, “that she might seduce me?”\nWensicia merely shrugged.\n“I’d say she’s a little old for that, wouldn’t you?” Farad’n asked.\n“With a Bene Gesserit, nothing’s certain,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n experienced a shiver of excitement tinged with fear. Playing this game to restore House of Corrino’s high seat of power both attracted and repelled him. How attractive it remained, the urge to retire from this game into his preferred pursuits—historical research and learning the manifest duties for ruling here on Salusa Secundus. The restoration of his Sardaukar forces was a task in itself... and for that job, Tyek was still a good tool. One planet was, after all, an enormous responsibility. But the Empire was an even greater responsibility, far more attractive as an instrument of power. And the more he read about Muad’Dib/Paul Atreides, the more fascinated Farad’n became with the uses of power. As titular head of House Corrino, heir of Shaddam IV, what a great achievement it would be to restore his line to the Lion Throne. He wanted that! He wanted it. Farad’n had found that, by repeating this\nenticing litany to himself several times, he could overcome momentary doubts.\nTyekanik was speaking: “...and of course, the Bene Gesserit teach that peace encourages aggressions, thus igniting war. The paradox of—”\n“How did we get on this subject?” Farad’n asked, bringing his attention back from the arena of speculation.\n“Why,” Wensicia said sweetly, having noted the wool- gathering expression on her son’s face, “I merely asked if Tyek was familiar with the driving philosophy behind the Sisterhood.”\n“Philosophy should be approached with irreverence,” Farad’n said, turning to face Tyekanik. “In regard to Idaho’s offer, | think we should inquire further. When we think we know something, that’s precisely the moment when we should look deeper into the thing.”\n“It will be done,” Tyekanik said. He liked this cautious streak in Farad’n, but hoped it did not extend to those military decisions which required speed and precision.\nWith seeming irrelevancy, Farad’n asked: “Do you know what | find most interesting about the history of Arrakis? It was the custom in primitive times for Fremen to kill on sight anyone not clad in a stillsuit with its easily visible and characteristic hood.”\n“What is your fascination with the stillsuit?” Tyekanik asked.\n“So you've noticed, eh?”\n“How could we not notice?” Wensicia asked.\nFarad’n sent an irritated glance at his mother. Why did She interrupt like that? He returned his attention to Tyekanik.\n“The stillsuit is the key to that planet’s character, Tyek. It’s the hallmark of Dune. People tend to focus on the physical characteristics: the stillsuit conserves body moisture, recycles it, and makes it possible to exist on such a planet. You know, the Fremen custom was to have one\nstillsuit for each member of a family, except for food gatherers. They had spares. But please note, both of you—” He moved to include his mother in this. “—how garments which appear to be stillsuits, but really aren’t, have become high fashion throughout the Empire. It’s such a dominant characteristic for humans to copy the conqueror!”\n“Do you really find such information valuable?” Tyekanik asked, his tone puzzled.\n“Tyek, Tyvek—without such information, one cannot govern. | said the stillsuit was the key to their character and it is! It’s a conservative thing. The mistakes they make will be conservative mistakes.”\nTyekanik glanced at Wensicia, who was staring at her son with a worried frown. This characteristic of Farad’n’s both attracted and worried the Bashar. It was so unlike old Shaddam. Now, there had been an essential Sardaukar: a military killer with few inhibitions. But Shaddam had fallen to the Atreides under that damnable Paul. Indeed, what he read of Paul Atreides revealed just such characteristics as Farad’n now displayed. It was possible that Farad’n might hesitate less than the Atreides over brutal necessities, but that was his Sardaukar training.\n“Many have governed without using this kind of information,” Tyekanik said.\nFarad’n merely stared at him for a moment. Then: “Governed and failed.”\nTyekanik’s mouth drew into a stiff line at this obvious allusion to Shaddam’s failure. That had been a Sardaukar failure, too, and no Sardaukar could recall it easily.\nHaving made his point, Farad’n said: “You see, Tyek, the influence of a planet upon the mass unconscious of its inhabitants has never been fully appreciated. To defeat the Atreides, we must understand not only Caladan but Arrakis: one planet soft and the other a training ground for hard decisions. That was a unique event, that marriage of\nAtreides and Fremen. We must know how it worked or we won't be able to match it, let alone defeat it.”\n“What does this have to do with Idaho’s offer?” Wensicia demanded.\nFarad’n glanced pityingly down at his mother. “We begin their defeat by the kinds of stress we introduce into their society. That’s a very powerful tool: stress. And the lack of it is important, too. Did you not mark how the Atreides helped things grow soft and easy here?”\nTyekanik allowed himself a curt nod of agreement. That was a good point. The Sardaukar could not be permitted to grow too soft. This offer from Idaho still bothered him, though. He said: “Perhaps it’d be best to reject the offer.”\n“Not yet,” Wensicia said. “We’ve a spectrum of choices open to us. Our task is to identify as much of the spectrum as we can. My son is right: we need more information.”\nFarad’n stared at her, measuring her intent as well as the surface meaning of her words. “But will we know when we’ve passed the point of no alternate choice?” he asked.\nA sour chuckle came from Tyekanik. “If you ask me, we’re long past the point of no return.”\nFarad’n tipped his head back to laugh aloud. “But we still have alternate choices, Tyek! When we come to the end of our rope, that’s an important place to recognize!”\nIn this age when the means of human transport include devices which can span the deeps of space in transtime, and other devices which can carry men swiftly over virtually impassable planetary surfaces, it seems odd to think of attempting long journeys afoot. Yet this remains a primary means of travel on Arrakis, a fact attributed partly to preference and partly to the brutal treatment which this planet reserves for anything mechanical. In the strictures of Arrakis, human flesh remains the most durable and reliable resource for the Hajj. Perhaps it is the implicit awareness of this fact which makes Arrakis the ultimate mirror of the soul.\n—HANDBOOK OF THE HAJJ\nlowly, cautiously, Ghanima made her way back to Tabr,\nholding herself to the deepest shadows of the dunes, crouching in stillness as the search party passed to the south of her. Terrible awareness gripped her: the worm which had taken the tigers and Leto’s body, the dangers ahead. He was gone; her twin was gone. She put aside all tears and nurtured her rage. In this, she was pure Fremen. And she knew this, reveling in it.\nShe understood what was said about Fremen. They were not supposed to have a conscience, having lost it ina burning for revenge against those who had driven them from planet to planet in the long wandering. That was foolishness, of course. Only the rawest primitive had no conscience. Fremen possessed a highly evolved conscience which centered on their own welfare as a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9fe323594583bf66e6051dee70cc2026311216dc386104d58b46d1e77087b1c7_v2"}
