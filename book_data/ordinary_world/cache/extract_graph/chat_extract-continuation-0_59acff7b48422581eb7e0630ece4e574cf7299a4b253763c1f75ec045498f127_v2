子们的心情。孙家穷困潦倒几辈子，孩子们现在为他们修建这院地方，多半是给村里人证明：孙家再不是过去的孙家了！这些日子里，全家人都忙得不可开交。尤其是他的少安，真是八下里忙啊！又要为他箍窑，还要照料砖场的事。最近几天，听说他还要谈什么“判”，准备承包乡上的砖瓦厂，另外，儿媳妇马上就要生娃娃，行动不方便，因此，一些具体事，他和老伴能做到的，尽量不麻烦少安和秀莲……入夏以来，孙少安也的确是太忙了。砖场正走上坡路，他得特别经心，以免再导致一次意外的灾难。同时，他还要招呼着为父亲营造新地方。 \n　　为老人建新家，这是孙少安多年的心愿。他决心要把父亲住的地方修建得比他自己现在住的那院地方更好。他要瞒着好强的弟弟，再添进双倍的钱，把这院地方搞漂亮，正如少平说的，某种意义上，这是为孙家立一块“纪念碑”。他不仅要用细錾出窑面石料，还要戴砖帽！另外，除过围墙，再用一色青砖砌个有气派的门楼——他有得是砖！ \n　　卫红的女婿金强给他站场任总指挥，金强在村里年轻一代匠人中，石活水平是最高的。另外，又是为妻子的大爹干活，因此特别经心。 \n　　尽管有金强在现场总料理，但少安在大的方面还得分出好多精力来管这件事。 \n　　他里里外外忙得一塌糊涂，一天跑下来，腿都疼得瘸了。糟糕的是，他最得力的助手秀莲马上就要临产，不能象过去那样给他强有力的帮扶。尽管如此，妻子腆着大肚子，仍然一阵儿也不闲着。 \n　　自父亲那边开始新建地方，老祖母和父母亲都暂时搬到他这边来住了。另外一孔窑洞腾出来给两面的工匠做饭。母亲和妻子一块上手都忙不过来，没办法只好又把妹妹卫红叫过来帮忙。 \n　　一年多来命运的升降沉浮，使秀莲和老人的关系一下子变得特别亲密。只是因为父母亲坚决不愿再连累他们，才使秀莲放弃了这打算。不过，实际上他们现在又象一家人了。 \n　　如今秀莲除不干涉他给老人使用钱，还常提醒他应该给老人们买个什么东西或添置衣物铺盖。在为父母建新家垫钱的问题上，他们的认识高度一致；而且筑院门楼的建议就是秀莲提出来的。 \n　　生活如此叫人感慨万端！贫困时，这家人风雨同舟；日子稍有好转，便产生了矛盾，导致了分家的局面。而经过一次又一次生活风暴的冲刷，这个家又变得这样亲密无间了。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUN
