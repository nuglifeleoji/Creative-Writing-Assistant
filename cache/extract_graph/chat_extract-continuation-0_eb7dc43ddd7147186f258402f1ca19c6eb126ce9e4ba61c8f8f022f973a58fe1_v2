Most historical accounts divert attention from the secret influences around the recorded events.”\nThat was the one that had brought down Bellonda. She had taken it up on her own, admitting: “The few histories that escape this restrictive process vanish into obscurity through obvious processes.”\nTeg had listed some of the processes: “Destruction of as many copies as possible, burying the too revealing accounts in ridicule, ignoring them in the centers of education, insuring that they are not quoted elsewhere and, in some cases, elimination of the authors.”\nNot to mention the scapegoat process that brought death to more than one messenger bearing unwelcome news,\nOdrade thought. She recalled an ancient ruler who kept a pikestaff handy with which to kill messengers who brought bad news.\n“We have a good base of information upon which to build a better understanding of our past,” Odrade had argued. “We've always known that what was at stake in conflicts was the determination of who would control the wealth or its equivalent.”\nMaybe it was not a real “noble purpose” but it would do for the time being.\nl am avoiding the central issue, she thought.\nSomething would have to be done about Duncan Idaho and they all knew it.\nWith a sigh, Odrade summoned a ‘thopter and prepared herself for the short trip to the no-ship.\nDuncan’s prison was at least comfortable, Odrade thought when she entered it. This had been the ship commander’s quarters lately occupied by Miles Teg. There were still signs of his presence here—a small holostat projector revealing a scene of his home on Lernaeus; the stately old house, the long lawn, the river. Teg had left a sewing kit behind on a bedside table.\nThe ghola sat in a sling chair staring at the projection. He looked up listlessly when Odrade entered.\n“You just left him back there to die, didn’t you?” Duncan asked.\n“We do what we must,” she said. “And | obeyed his orders.”\n“I know why you’re here,” Duncan said. “And you’re not going to change my mind. I’m not a damned stud for the witches. You understand me?”\nOdrade smoothed her robe and sat on the edge of the bed facing Duncan. “Have you examined the record my father left for us?” she asked.\n“Your father?”\n“Miles Teg was my father. | commend his last words to you. He was our eyes there at the end. He had to see the death on Rakis. The ‘mind at its beginning’ understood dependencies and key logs.”\nWhen Duncan looked puzzled, she explained: “We were trapped too long in the Tyrant’s oracular maze.”\nShe saw how he sat up more alertly, the feline movements that spoke of muscles well conditioned to attack.\n“There is no way you can escape alive from this ship,” She said. “You know why.”\n“Siona.”\n“You are a danger to us but we would prefer that you lived a useful life.”\n“I’m still not going to breed for you, especially not with that little twit from Rakis.”\nOdrade smiled, wondering how Sheeana would respond to that description.\n“You think it’s funny?” Duncan demanded.\n“Not really. But we’ll still have Murbella’s child, of course. | guess that will have to satisfy us.”\n“I’ve been talking to Murbella on the com,” Duncan said. “She thinks she’s going to be a Reverend Mother, that you're going to accept her into the Bene Gesserit.”\n“Why not? Her cells pass the proof of Siona. | think she will make a superb Sister.”\n“Has she really taken you in?”\n“You mean, have we failed to observe that she thinks she will go along with us until she learns our secrets and then she will escape? Oh, we know that, Duncan.”\n“You don’t think she can get away from you?”\n“Once we get them, Duncan, we never really lose them.”\n“You don’t think you lost the Lady Jessica?”\n“She came back to us in the end.”\n“Why did you really come out here to see me?”\n“| thought you deserved an explanation of the Mother Superior’s design. It was aimed at the destruction of Rakis, you see. What she really wanted was the elimination of almost all of the worms.”\n“Great Gods below! Why?”\n“They were an oracular force holding us in bondage. Those pearls of the Tyrant’s awareness magnified that hold. He didn’t predict events, he created them.”\nDuncan pointed toward the rear of the ship. “But what about...”\n“That one? It’s just one now. By the time it reaches sufficient numbers to be an influence once more, humankind will have gone its own way beyond him. We'll be too numerous by then, doing too many different things on our own. No single force will rule all of our futures completely, never again.”\nShe stood.\nWhen he did not respond, she said: “Within the imposed limits, which | know you appreciate, please think about the kind of life you want to lead. | promise to help you in any way | can.”\n“Why would you do that?”\n“Because my ancestors loved you. Because my father loved you.”\n“Love? You witches can’t feel love!”\nShe stared down at him for almost a minute. The bleached hair was growing out dark at the roots and curling once more into ringlets, especially at his neck, she saw.\n“I feel what | feel,” she said. “And your water is ours, Duncan Idaho.”\nShe saw the Fremen admonition have its effect on him and then turned away and was passed out of the room by the guards.\nBefore leaving the ship, she went back to the hold and stared down at the quiescent worm on its bed of Rakian sand. Her viewport looked down from some two hundred\nmeters onto the captive. As she looked, she shared a silent laugh with the increasingly integrated Taraza.\nWe were right and Schwangyu and her people were wrong. We knew he wanted out. He had to want that after what he did.\nShe spoke aloud in a soft whisper, as much for herself as for the nearby observers stationed there to watch for the moment when metamorphosis began in that worm.\n“We have your language now,” she said.\nThere were no words in the language, only a moving, dancing adaptation to a moving, dancing universe. You could only speak the language, not translate it. To know the meaning you had to go through the experience and even then the meaning changed before your eyes. “Noble purpose” was, after all, an untranslatable experience. But when she looked down at the rough, heat-immune hide of that worm from the Rakian desert, Odrade knew what she saw: the visible evidence of noble purpose.\nSoftly, she called down to him: “Hey! Old worm! Was this your design?”\nThere was no answer but then she had not really expected an answer.\nCHAPTERHGUSE:\n \nFRANK HERBERT\nCHAPTERHOUSE: DUNE\nFRANK HERBERT\nneliow by Brian Herk\nACE Published by Berkley An imprint of Penguin Random House LLC 1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10019\nCopyright © 1985 by Herbert Properties LLC\n“Introduction” by Brian Herbert copyright © 2009 by DreamStar, Inc.\nPenguin Random House supports copyright.

It is a fascinating milieu, populated by gholas grown from dead human cells, as well as shape-shifting Face Dancers, half-human Futars, cloned humans, and mutant, conspiratorial Guild Navigators. There are immense Heighliners that fold space to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye, along with nearly invisible no-ships and no- chambers that contain mysterious machinery.\nAs the novel opens, the planet Dune has already been destroyed by Honored Matres, powerful, enigmatic women who emerged from the Scattering that the God Emperor set into motion long ago in order to spread humankind across uncounted star systems. On planet Chapterhouse, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood has a giant sandworm, obtained surreptitiously, that is metamorphosing into sandtrout. Thus the Sisters have initiated a desertification process that could result in a new Dune, and a new source of the priceless spice melange, a finite resource that they need and hope to control...\nThis is the sixth novel in Frank Herbert’s classic, wildly popular science fiction series, and the last story in the highly imaginative Dune universe that he wrote. He typed much of the novel at his home in Hawaii, where he tended to the serious medical needs of my mother, Beverly Herbert. A professional writer herself, she helped with the plotting of the book and provided him with the title before she passed\naway in 1984. My father did not complete the writing task, however, until after her death, when he returned to Washington State.\nIt is impossible for me to read Chapterhouse: Dune, or to even think about it, without experiencing powerful reminders of my mother and the relationship she had with my father for almost four decades. An extraordinary woman, she was the basis of the literary character Lady Jessica in the first three novels of the Dune series, and the source of many of the aphorisms that are so familiar to Dune fans. The strong presence of women later in the epic saga— particularly in the fifth and sixth novels—stemmed from her as well.\nAs their son, | watched my parents interact and strengthen each other in countless ways. | can honestly say that | never heard them raise their voices to each other, though they did have\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARCHIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Archives is an organization that preserves historical records and has clashed with the Bashar over the handling of information.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASHAR<|>PERSON<|>The Bashar is a figure who made a controversial statement about the destruction of historical records.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a person who challenged the Bashar's views on historical records and was affected by the resulting controversy.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a person who listed methods used to suppress historical accounts.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit leader who engages in strategic discussions and decisions regarding the future of the Sisterhood.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola and a key figure in the Bene Gesserit's plans, resistant to their breeding programs.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is Odrade's father and a military leader whose last words are significant to the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is the planet Dune, which was destroyed, and its worms are a central focus of the Bene Gesserit's plans.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEARNAEUS<|>GEO<|>Lernaeus is the home of Miles Teg, featuring a stately house and a river.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapterhouse is the planet where the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood is based and where they are creating a new desert.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with advanced abilities, engaged in long-term genetic and political strategies.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a person from Rakis, involved in the Bene Gesserit's breeding plans.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a person who is being considered for induction into the Bene Gesserit and is carrying Duncan Idaho's child.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a powerful group of women who emerged from the Scattering and destroyed Dune.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESTRUCTION OF RAKIS<|>EVENT<|>The destruction of Rakis was an event orchestrated by the Bene Gesserit to eliminate the worms and the Tyrant's influence.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a leader of the Bene Gesserit, making key decisions for the Sisterhood.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan Idaho is a key figure in the Bene Gesserit's breeding programs, though he resists their plans.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>ODRADE<|>Miles Teg is Odrade's father and a significant influence on her decisions.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Odrade is trying to persuade Duncan Idaho to cooperate with the Bene Gesserit's plans.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>RAKIS<|>The Bene Gesserit orchestrated the destruction of Rakis to eliminate the worms and the Tyrant's influence.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit are in conflict with the Honored Matres, who destroyed Dune.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MURBELLA<|>Duncan Idaho and Murbella have a child together, which is significant to the Bene Gesserit.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MILES TEG<|>Odrade respects and follows the last words of her father, Miles Teg.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BASHAR<|>ARCHIVES<|>The Bashar made a controversial statement that clashed with the Archives' mission.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>BASHAR<|>Bellonda challenged the Bashar's views on historical records.<|>5\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
