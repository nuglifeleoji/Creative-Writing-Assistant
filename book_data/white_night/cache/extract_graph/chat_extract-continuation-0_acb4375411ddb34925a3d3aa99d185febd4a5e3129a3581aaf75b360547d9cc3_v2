娜娜惊醒过来，“我也不知道。就是好像突然想到了一些什么。轩宇，那你现在最想学什么呢？老师也要想想，看看怎么教你。”\n\n    蓝轩宇歪着头，道：“娜娜老师，我有点不敢打人，有没有什么不被别人打的办法啊？”\n\n    娜娜笑了，“为什么不敢打人啊？”\n\n    “我有点胆小呀。”蓝轩宇有些扭捏着道。\n\n    娜娜顿时笑的更加灿烂了，哪怕只是小孩子，看着她那宛如春花烂漫般的笑容，蓝轩宇也不禁呆了呆。\n\n    “在这里也没法教你操控元素。不如，老师教你一个步法吧。这个你学的好了，别人就打不到你了。好不好？”\n\n    “好啊！好啊！”蓝轩宇笑道。\n\n    “那你来抓我试试。”娜娜微笑着道。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“抓你干嘛啊？”\n\n    娜娜道：“抓住我，老师就给你奖励。抓不住就有惩罚哦。”\n\n    蓝轩宇惊喜的道：“奖励？”\n\n    娜娜笑道：“抓住我，老师就让你亲一下，要是抓不住，就惩罚你让我亲一下，好不好？”当她说出这句话的时候，自己也不禁呆了呆。因为自从从冰冻中苏醒过来之后，她从来都不让人亲近到身边，哪怕是女性都不行。可面对眼前这个孩子，却不知道为什么，所有的一切似乎都不再设防。\n\n    “好吧。那我来喽。”蓝轩宇一边说着，猛的向前一扑，扑向娜娜。\n\n    娜娜只是后退一步，几乎就在他手指接触到自己身体前的一瞬，退开半分。蓝轩宇顿时抓在空处。\n\n    他赶忙一个垫步又扑了过去。娜娜略微一拧身，脚步也很自然的横移半分，又让开了他这一抓。\n\n    蓝轩宇下意识的就想要释放自己的武魂，但他马上发现，在这里他根本就没法释放。只能是追逐着去抓。\n\n    娜娜看上去只是在方寸之地移动，速度也不快，可脚下却始终循着一种玄奥的至理，无论他怎么去抓，却就是无法接近到她身边。\n\n    精神的世界中，同样会感到疲惫。一会儿的工夫，蓝轩宇就停了下来。\n\n    眼前的一切似乎都变得虚幻了几分，“老师，我抓不到你呀。我好困。”\n\n
