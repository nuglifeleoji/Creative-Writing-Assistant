wings. She felt her spirit go out to them: they had a place to hide; she had none.\n“M’Lady, the wind comes!”\nShe turned, saw the ghola calling to her outside the upper entrance to the sietch. Fremen fears gripped her. Clean death and the body’s water claimed for the tribe, these she understood. But... something brought back from death...\nWindblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the storm had taken ona tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She\nhesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert’s transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs.\nThe storm out there had become a universal thing for her —all the animals hiding from it... nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds: blown sand scraping along rock, a wind-surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill—then! somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths.\nIt was only a moment as her life measured time, but in that moment she felt this planet being swept away—cosmic dust, part of other waves.\n“We must hurry,” the ghola said from right beside her.\nShe sensed fear in him then, concern for her safety.\n“It'll shred the flesh from your bones,” he said, as though he needed to explain such a storm to her.\nHer fear of him dispelled by his obvious concern, Chani allowed the ghola to help her up the rock stairway to the sietch. They entered the twisting baffle which protected the entrance. Attendants opened the moisture seals, closed them behind.\nSietch odors assaulted her nostrils. The place was a ferment of nasal memories—the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work... and through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere.\nShe took a deep breath. “Home.”\nThe ghola took his hand from her arm, stood aside, a patient figure now, almost as though turned off when not in use. Yet... he watched.\nChani hesitated in the entrance chamber, puzzled by something she could not name. This was truly her home. As a child, she’d hunted scorpions here by glowglobe light. Something was changed, though...\n“Shouldn’t you be going to your quarters, m’Lady?” the ghola asked.\nAs though ignited by his words, a rippling birth constriction seized her abdomen. She fought against revealing it.\n“M’Lady?” the ghola said.\n“Why is Paul afraid for me to bear our children?” she asked.\n“It is a natural thing to fear for your safety,” the ghola said.\nShe put a hand to her cheek where the sand had reddened it. “And he doesn’t fear for the children?”\n“M’Lady, he cannot think of a child without remembering that your firstborn was slain by the Sardaukar.”\nShe studied the ghola—flat face, unreadable mechanical eyes. Was he truly Duncan Idaho, this creature? Was he friend to anyone? Had he spoken truthfully now?\n“You should be with the medics,” the ghola said.\nAgain, she heard the fear for her safety in his voice. She felt abruptly that her mind lay undefended, ready to be invaded by shocking perceptions.\n“Hayt, I’m afraid,” she whispered. “Where is my Usul?”\n“Affairs of state detain him,” the ghola said.\nShe nodded, thinking of the government apparatus which had accompanied them in a great flight of ornithopters. Abruptly, she realized what puzzled her about the sietch: outworld odors. The clerks and aides had brought their own perfumes into this environment, aromas of diet and clothing, of exotic toiletries. They were an undercurrent of odors here.\nChani shook herself, concealing an urge to bitter laughter. Even the smells changed in Muad’Dib’s presence!\n“There were pressing matters which he could not defer,” the ghola said, misreading her hesitation.\n“Yes... yes, | understand. | came with that swarm, too.”\nRecalling the flight from Arrakeen, she admitted to herself now that she had not expected to survive it. Paul had insisted on piloting his own ‘thopter. Eyeless, he had guided the machine here. After that experience, she knew nothing he did could surprise her.\nAnother pain fanned out through her abdomen.\nThe ghola saw her indrawn breath, the tightening of her cheeks, said: “Is it your time?”\n“Tr... yes, it is.”\n“You must not delay,” he said. He grasped her arm, hurried her down the hall.\nShe sensed panic in him, said: “There’s time.”\nHe seemed not to hear. “The Zensunni approach to birth,” he said, urging her even faster, “is to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension. Do not compete with what is happening. To compete is to prepare for failure. Do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything. This way, you achieve everything.”\nWhile he spoke, they reached the entrance to her quarters. He thrust her through the hangings, cried out: “Harah! Harah! It is Chani’s time. Summon the medics!”\nHis call brought attendants running. There was a great bustling of people in which Chani felt herself an isolated island of calm... until the next pain came.\nHayt, dismissed to the outer passage, took time to wonder at his own actions. He felt fixated at some point of time where all truths were only temporary. Panic lay beneath his actions, he realized. Panic centered not on the possibility that Chani might die, but that Paul should come to him afterward... filled with grief... his loved one... gone...gone...\nSomething cannot emerge from nothing, the ghola told himself. From what does this panic emerge?\nHe felt that his mentat faculties had been dulled, let out a long, shuddering breath. A psychic shadow passed over him.\nIn the emotional darkness of it, he felt himself waiting for some absolute sound—the snap of a branch in a jungle.\nA sigh shook him. Danger had passed without striking.\nSlowly, marshaling his powers, shedding bits of inhibition, he sank into mentat awareness. He forced it—not the best way—but somehow necessary. Ghost shadows moved within him in place of people. He was a trans-shipping station for every datum he had ever encountered. His being was inhabited by creatures of possibility. They passed in review to be compared, judged.\nPerspiration broke out on his forehead.\nThoughts with fuzzy edges feathered away into darkness —unknown. Infinite systems! A mentat could not function without realizing he worked in infinite systems. Fixed knowledge could not surround the infinite. Everywhere could not be brought into finite perspective. Instead, he must become the infinite—momentarily.\nIn one gestalten spasm, he had it, seeing Bijaz seated before him blazing from some inner fire.\nBijaz!\nThe dwarf had done something to him!\nHayt felt himself teetering on the lip of a deadly pit. He projected the mentat computation line forward, seeing what could develop out of his own actions.\n“A compulsion!” he gasped. “I’ve been rigged with a compulsion!”\nA blue-robed courier, passing as Hayt spoke, hesitated. “Did you say something, sirra?”\nNot looking at him, the ghola nodded. “I said everything.”\nThere was a man so wise, He jumped into A sandy place And burnt out both his eyes! And when he knew his eyes were gone, He offered no complaint. He summoned up a vision And made himself a saint.\n—CHILDREN’S VERSE FROM HISTORY OF MUAD’DIB\npau! stood in darkness outside the sietch. Oracular vision told him it was night, that moonlight silhouetted the Shrine atop Chin Rock high on his left. This was a memory- saturated place, his first sietch, where he and Chani...\nI must not think of Chani, he told himself.\nThe thinning cup of his vision told him of changes all around—a cluster of palms far down to the right, the black- silver line of a qanat carrying water through the dunes piled up by that morning’s storm.\nWater flowing in the desert! He recalled another kind of water flowing in a river of his birthworld, Caladan. He hadn’t realized then the treasure of such a flow, even the murky slithering in a qanat across a desert basin. Treasure.\nWith a delicate cough, an aide came up from behind.\nPaul held out his hands for a magnabord with a single sheet of metallic paper on it. He moved as sluggishly as the qanat’s water. The vision flowed, but he found himself increasingly reluctant to move with it.\n“Pardon, Sire,” the aide said. “The Semboule Treaty—your signature?”\n“I can read it!” Paul snapped. He scrawled “Atreides Imper.” in the proper place, returned the board, thrusting it\ndirectly into the aide’s outstretched hand, aware of the fear this inspired.\nThe man fled.\nPaul turned away. Ugly, barren land! He imagined it sun- soaked and monstrous with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools, blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals. But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places with vistas of storm-trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges.\nAll it required was water... and love.\nLife changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life— all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together!\nThey wouldn’t understand. In the desert, they were endlessly desert. Growing things performed no green ballet for them.\nHe clenched his fists at his sides, trying to halt the vision. He wanted to flee from his own mind. It was a beast come to devour him! Awareness lay in him, sodden, heavy with all the living it had sponged up, saturated with too many experiences.\nDesperately, Paul squeezed his thoughts outward.\nStars!\nAwareness turned over at the thought of all those stars above him—an infinite volume. A man must be half mad to imagine he could rule even a teardrop of that volume. He couldn’t begin to imagine the number of subjects his Imperium claimed.\nSubjects? Worshippers and enemies, more likely. Did any among them see beyond rigid beliefs? Where was one man who’d escaped the narrow destiny of his prejudices? Not\neven an Emperor escaped. He’d lived a take-everything life, tried to create a universe in his own image. But the exultant universe was breaking across him at last with its silent waves.\n| spit on Dune! he thought. / give it my moisture!\nThis myth he’d made out of intricate movements and imagination, out of moonlight and love, out of prayers older than Adam, and gray cliffs and crimson shadows, laments and rivers of martyrs—what had it come to at last?

When the waves receded, the shores of Time would spread out there clean, empty, shining with infinite grains of memory and little else. Was this the golden genesis of man?\nSand scuffed against rocks told him that the ghola had joined him.\n“You've been avoiding me today, Duncan,” Paul said.\n“It’s dangerous for you to call me that,” the ghola said.\n“I know.”\n“I... Came to warn you, m’Lord.”\n“I know.”\nThe story of the compulsion Bijaz had put on him poured from the ghola then.\n“Do you know the nature of the compulsion?” Paul asked.\n“Violence.”\nPaul felt himself arriving at a place which had claimed him from the beginning. He stood suspended. The Jihad had seized him, fixed him onto a glidepath from which the terrible gravity of the Future would never release him.\n“There'll be no violence from Duncan,” Paul whispered.\n“But, Sire...”\n“Tell me what you see around us,” Paul said.\n“M’Lord?”\n“The desert—how is it tonight?”\n“Don’t you see it?”\n“I have no eyes, Duncan.”\n“But...”\n“I’ve only my vision,” Paul said, “and wish I didn’t have it. I’m dying of prescience, did you know that, Duncan?”\n“Perhaps... what you fear won’t happen,” the ghola said.\n“What? Deny my own oracle? How can | when I’ve seen it fulfilled thousands of times? People call it a power, a gift. It’s an affliction! It won’t let me leave my life where | found it!”\n“M’Lord,” the ghola muttered, “I... it isn’t... young master, you don’t... I...” He fell silent.\nPaul sensed the ghola’s confusion, said: “What’d you call me, Duncan?”\n“What? What!...foramoment...” “You called me ‘young master.’” “I did, yes.”\n“That’s what Duncan always called me.” Paul reached out, touched the ghola’s face. “Was that part of your Tleilaxu training?”\n“No.” Paul lowered his hand. “What, then?” “It came from... me.”\n“Do you serve two masters?” “Perhaps.”\n“Free yourself from the ghola, Duncan.” “How?”\n“You’re human. Do a human thing.” “I’m a ghola!”\n“But your flesh is human. Duncan’s in there.”\n“Something’s in there.”\n“I care not how you do it,” Paul said, “but you'll do it.”\n“You've foreknowledge?”\n“Foreknowledge be damned!” Paul turned away. His vision hurtled forward now, gaps in it, but it wasn’t a thing to be stopped.\n“M’Lord, if you’ve—”\n“Quiet!” Paul held up a hand. “Did you hear that?”\n“Hear what, m’Lord?”\nPaul shook his head. Duncan hadn't heard it. Had he only imagined the sound? It’d been his tribal name called from the desert—far away and low: “Usul...\nUuuussssuuuullll.. .”\n“What is it, m’Lord?”\nPaul shook his head. He felt watched. Something out there in the night shadows knew he was here. Something? No—someone.\n“It was mostly sweet,” he whispered, “and you were the sweetest of all.”\n“What'd you say, m’Lord?”\n“It’s the future,” Paul said.\nThat amorphous human universe out there had undergone a spurt of motion, dancing to the tune of his vision. It had struck a powerful note then. The ghost-echoes might endure.\n“| don’t understand, m’Lord,” the ghola said.\n“A Fremen dies when he’s too long from the desert,” Paul said. “They call it the ‘water sickness.’ Isn’t that odd?”\n“That’s very odd.”\nPaul strained at memories, tried to recall the sound of Chani breathing beside him in the night. Where is there comfort? he wondered. All he could remember was Chani at breakfast the day they’d left for the desert. She’d been restless, irritable.\n“Why do you wear that old jacket?” she’d demanded, eyeing the black uniform coat with its red hawk crest beneath his Fremen robes. “You’re an Emperor!”\n“Even an Emperor has his favorite clothing,” he’d said.\nFor no reason he could explain, this had brought real tears to Chani’s eyes—the second time in her life when Fremen inhibitions had been shattered.\nNow, in the darkness, Paul rubbed his own cheeks, felt moisture there. Who gives moisture to the dead? he wondered. It was his own face, yet not his. The wind chilled the wet skin. A frail dream formed, broke. What was this\nswelling in his breast? Was it something he’d eaten? How bitter and plaintive was this other self, giving moisture to the dead. The wind bristled with sand. The skin, dry now, was his own. But whose was the quivering which remained?\nThey heard the wailing then, far away in the sietch depths. It grew louder... louder...\nThe ghola whirled at a sudden glare of light, someone flinging wide the entrance seals. In the light, he saw a man with a raffish grin—no! Not a grin, but a grimace of grief! It was a Fedaykin lieutenant named Tandis. Behind him came a press of many people, all fallen silent now that they saw Muad’Dib.\n“Chani...” Tandis said.\n“Is dead,” Paul whispered. “I heard her call.”\nHe turned toward the sietch. He knew this place. It was a place where he could not hide. His onrushing vision illuminated the entire Fremen mob. He saw Tandis, felt the Fedaykin’s grief, the fear and anger.\n“She is gone,” Paul said.\nThe ghola heard the words out of a blazing corona. They burned his chest, his backbone, the sockets of his metal eyes. He felt his right hand move toward the knife at his belt. His own thinking became strange, disjointed. He was a puppet held fast by strings reaching down from that awful corona. He moved to another’s commands, to another’s desires. The strings jerked his arms, his legs, his jaw. Sounds came squeezing out of his mouth, a terrifying repetitive noise—\n“Hraak! Hraak! Hraak!”\nThe knife came up to strike. In that instant, he grabbed his own voice, shaped rasping words: “Run! Young master, run!”\n“We will not run,” Paul said. “We’ll move with dignity. We’ll do what must be done.”\nThe ghola’s muscles locked. He shuddered, swayed.\n“...what must be done!” The words rolled in his mind like a great fish surfacing. “...what must be done!” Ahhh, that had sounded like the old Duke, Paul’s grandfather. The young master had some of the old man in him. “...what must be done!”\nThe words began to unfold in the ghola’s consciousness. A sensation of living two lives simultaneously spread out through his awareness: Hayt / Idaho / Hayt / Idaho... He became a motionless chain of relative existence, singular, alone. Old memories flooded his mind. He marked them, adjusted them to new understandings, made a beginning at the integration of a new awareness. A new persona achieved a temporary form of internal tyranny. The masculating synthesis remained charged with potential disorder, but events pressed him to the temporary adjustment. The young master needed him.\nIt was done then. He knew himself as Duncan Idaho, remembering everything of Hayt as though it had been stored secretly in him and ignited by a flaming catalyst. The corona dissolved. He shed the Tleilaxu compulsions.\n“Stay close to me, Duncan,” Paul said. “lIl need to depend on you for many things.” And, as Idaho continued to stand entranced: “Duncan!”\n“Yes, |am Duncan.”\n“Of course you are! This was the moment when you came back. We’ll go inside now.”\nIdaho fell into step beside Paul. It was like the old times, yet not like them. Now that he stood free of the Tleilaxu, he could appreciate what they had given him. Zensunni training permitted him to overcome the shock of events. The mentat accomplishment formed a counterbalance. He put off all fear, standing above the source. His entire consciousness looked outward from a position of infinite wonder: he had been dead; he was alive.\n“Sire,” the Fedaykin Tandis said as they approached him, “the woman, Lichna, says she must see you. | told her to\nwait.”\n“Thank you,” Paul said. “The birth...”\n“I spoke to the medics,” Tandis said, falling into step. “They said you have two children, both of them alive and sound.”\n“Two?” Paul stumbled, caught himself on Idaho’s arm.\n“A boy and a girl,” Tandis said. “I saw them. They're good Fremen babies.”\n“How ... how did she die?” Paul whispered.\n“M’Lord?” Tandis bent close.\n“Chani?” Paul said.\n“It was the birth, m’Lord,” Tandis husked. “They said her body was drained by the speed of it. | don’t understand, but that is what they said.”\n“Take me to her,” Paul whispered.\n“M’Lord?”\n“Take me to her!”\n“That’s where we're going, m’Lord.” Again, Tandis bent close to Paul. “Why does your ghola carry a bared knife?”\n“Duncan, put away your knife,” Paul said. “The time for violence is past.”\nAs he spoke, Paul felt closer to the sound of his voice than to the mechanism which had created the sound. Two babies! The vision had contained but one. Yet, these moments went as the vision went. There was a person here who felt grief and anger. Someone. His own awareness lay in the grip of an awful treadmill, replaying his life from memory.\nTwo babies?\nAgain he stumbled. Chani, Chani, he thought. There was no other way. Chani, beloved, believe me that this death was quicker for you... and kinder. They’d have held our children hostage, displayed you in a cage and slave pits, reviled you with the blame for my death. This way... this way we destroy them and save our children.\nChildren?\nOnce more, he stumbled.\n| permitted this, he thought. / should feel guilty.\nThe sound of noisy confusion filled the cavern ahead of them. It grew louder precisely as he remembered it growing louder. Yes, this was the pattern, the inexorable pattern, even with two children.\n", " mechanism which had created the sound. Two babies!

It grew louder precisely as he remembered it growing louder. Yes, this was the pattern, the inexorable pattern, even with two children.\nChani is dead, he told himself.\nAt some faraway instant in a past which he had shared with others, this future had reached down to him. It had chivvied him and herded him into a chasm whose walls grew narrower and narrower. He could feel them closing in on him. This was the way the vision went.\nChani is dead. | should abandon myself to grief.\nBut that was not the way the vision went.\n“Has Alia been summoned?” he asked.\n“She is with Chani’s friends,” Tandis said.\nPaul sensed the mob pressing back to give him passage. Their silence moved ahead of him like a wave. The noisy confusion began dying down. A sense of congested emotion filled the sietch. He wanted to remove the people from his vision, found it impossible. Every face turning to follow him carried its special imprint. They were pitiless with curiosity, those faces. They felt grief, yes, but he understood the cruelty which drenched them. They were watching the articulate become dumb, the wise become a fool. Didn’t the clown always appeal to cruelty?\nThis was more than a deathwatch, less than a wake.\nPaul felt his soul begging for respite, but still the vision moved him. Just a /ittle farther now, he told himself. Black, visionless dark awaited him just ahead. There lay the place ripped out of the vision by grief and guilt, the place where the moon fell.\nHe stumbled into it, would’ve fallen had Idaho not taken his arm in a fierce grip, a solid presence knowing how to Share his grief in silence.\n“Here is the place,” Tandis said.\n“Watch your step, Sire,” Idaho said, helping him over an entrance lip. Hangings brushed Paul’s face. Idaho pulled him to a halt. Paul felt the room then, a reflection against his cheeks and ears. It was a rock-walled space with the rock hidden behind tapestries.\n“Where is Chani?” Paul whispered.\nHarah’s voice answered him: “She is right here, Usul.”\nPaul heaved a trembling sigh. He had feared her body already had been removed to the stills where Fremen reclaimed the water of the tribe. Was that the way the vision went? He felt abandoned in his blindness.\n“The children?” Paul asked.\n“They are here, too, m’Lord,” Idaho said.\n“You have beautiful twins, Usul,” Harah said, “a boy anda girl. See? We have them here in a creche.”\nTwo children, Paul thought wonderingly. The vision had contained only a daughter. He cast himself adrift from Idaho’s arm, moved toward the place where Harah had spoken, stumbled into a hard surface. His hands explored it: the metaglass outlines of a creche.\nSomeone took his left arm. “Usul?” It was Harah. She guided his hand into the creche. He felt soft-soft flesh. It was so warm! He felt ribs, breathing.\n“That is your son,” Harah whispered. She moved his hand. “And this is your daughter.” Her hand tightened on his. “Usul, are you truly blind now?”\nHe knew what she was thinking. The blind must be abandoned in the desert. Fremen tribes carried no dead weight.\n“Take me to Chani,” Paul said, ignoring her question.\nHarah turned him, guided him to the left.\nPaul felt himself accepting now the fact that Chani was dead. He had taken his place in a universe he did not want, wearing flesh that did not fit. Every breath he drew bruised his emotions. Two children! He wondered if he had\ncommitted himself to a passage where his vision would never return. It seemed unimportant.\n“Where is my brother?”\nIt was Alia’s voice behind him. He heard the rush of her, the overwhelming presence as she took his arm from Harah.\n“I must speak to you!” Alia hissed.\n“In a moment,” Paul said.\n“Now! It’s about Lichna.”\n“I know,” Paul said. “In a moment.”\n“You don’t have a moment!”\n“I have many moments.”\n“But Chani doesn’t!”\n“Be still!” he ordered. “Chani is dead.” He put a hand across her mouth as she started to protest. “I order you to be still!” He felt her subside and removed his hand. “Describe what you see,” he said.\n“Paul!” Frustration and tears battled in her voice.\n“Never mind,” he said. And he forced himself to inner stillness, opened the eyes of his vision to this moment. Yes —it was still here. Chani’s body lay on a pallet within a ring of light. Someone had straightened her white robe, smoothed it trying to hide the blood from the birth. No matter; he could not turn his awareness from the vision of her face: such a mirror of eternity in the still features!\nHe turned away, but the vision moved with him. She was gone...never to return. The air, the universe, all vacant— everywhere vacant. Was this the essence of his penance? he wondered. He wanted tears, but they would not come. Had he lived too long a Fremen? This death demanded its moisture!\nNearby, a baby cried and was hushed. The sound pulled a curtain on his vision. Paul welcomed the darkness. This is another world, he thought. Two children.\nThe thought came out of some lost oracular trance. He tried to recapture the timeless mind-dilation of the melange, but awareness fell short. No burst of the future came into\nthis new consciousness. He felt himself rejecting the future —any future.\n“Goodbye, my Sihaya,” he whispered.\nAlia’s voice, harsh and demanding, came from somewhere behind him. “I’ve brought Lichna!”\nPaul turned. “That’s not Lichna,” he said. “That’s a Face Dancer. Lichna’s dead.”\n“But hear what she says,” Alia said.\nSlowly, Paul moved toward his sister’s voice.\n“I’m not surprised to find you alive, Atreides.” The voice was like Lichna’s, but with subtle differences, as though the speaker used Lichna’s vocal cords, but no longer bothered to control them sufficiently. Paul found himself struck by an odd note of honesty in the voice.\n“Not surprised?” Paul asked.\n“I am Scytale, a Tleilaxu of the Face Dancers, and | would know a thing before we bargain. Is that a ghola | see behind you, or Duncan Idaho?”\n“It’s Duncan Idaho,” Paul said. “And | will not bargain with you.”\n“I think you’ll bargain,” Scytale said.\n“Duncan,” Paul said, speaking over his shoulder, “will you kill this Tleilaxu if | ask it?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.” There was the suppressed rage of a berserker in Idaho’s voice.\n“Wait!” Alia said. “You don’t know what you’re rejecting.”\n“But | do know,” Paul said.\n“So it’s truly Duncan Idaho of the Atreides,” Scytale said. “We found the lever! A ghola can regain his past.” Paul heard footsteps. Someone brushed past him on the left. Scytale’s voice came from behind him now. “What do you remember of your past, Duncan?”\n“Everything. From my childhood on. | even remember you at the tank when they removed me from it,” Idaho said.\n“Wonderful,” Scytale breathed. “Wonderful.”\nPaul heard the voice moving. / need a vision, he thought. Darkness frustrated him. Bene Gesserit training warned him of terrifying menace in Scytale, yet the creature remained a voice, a shadow of movement—entirely beyond him.\n“Are these the Atreides babies?” Scytale asked.\n“Harah!” Paul cried. “Get her away from there!”\n“Stay where you are!” Scytale shouted. “All of you! | warn you, a Face Dancer can move faster than you suspect. My knife can have both these lives before you touch me.”\nPaul felt someone touch his right arm, then move off to the right.\n“That’s far enough, Alia,” Scytale said.\n“Alia,” Paul said. “Don’t.”\n“It’s my fault,” Alia groaned. “My fault!”\n“Atreides,” Scytale said, “shall we bargain now?”\nBehind him, Paul heard a single hoarse curse. His throat constricted at the suppressed violence in Idaho’s voice. Idaho must not break! Scytale would kill the babies!\n“To strike a bargain, one requires a thing to sell,” Scytale said. “Not so, Atreides? Will you have your Chani back? We can restore her to you. A ghola, Atreides. A ghola with full memory! But we must hurry. Call your friends to bring a cryological tank to preserve the flesh.”\nTo hear Chani’s voice once more, Paul thought. To feel her presence beside me. Ahhh, that’s why they gave me Idaho as a ghola, to let me discover how much the re-creation is like the original. But now—full restoration... at their price. ld be a Tleilaxu tool forevermore. And Chani... chained to the same fate by a threat to our children, exposed once more to the Qizarate’s plotting...\n“What pressures would you use to restore Chani’s memory to her?” Paul asked, fighting to keep his voice calm. “Would you condition her to... to kill one of her own children?”\n“We use whatever pressures we need,” Scytale said. “What say you, Atreides?”\n“Alia,” Paul said, “bargain with this thing. | cannot bargain with what | cannot see.”\n“A wise choice,” Scytale gloated. “Well, Alia, what do you offer me as your brother’s agent?”\nPaul lowered his head, bringing himself to stillness within stillness. He’d glimpsed something just then—like a vision, but not a vision. It had been a knife close to him. There!\n“Give me a moment to think,” Alia said.\n“My knife is patient,” Scytale said, “but Chani’s flesh is not. Take a reasonable amount of time.”\nPaul felt himself blinking. It could not be... but it was! He felt eyes! Their vantage point was odd and they moved in an erratic way. There! The knife swam into his view. With a breath-stilling shock, Paul recognized the viewpoint. It was that of one of his children! He was seeing Scytale’s knife hand from within the creche! It glittered only inches from him. Yes—and he could see himself across the room, as well —head down, standing quietly, a figure of no menace, ignored by the others in"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_3546d61452bac76f442be280a4ccc66061e64baaa6c6ddaf33ee6f7aa042ebd2_v2"}
