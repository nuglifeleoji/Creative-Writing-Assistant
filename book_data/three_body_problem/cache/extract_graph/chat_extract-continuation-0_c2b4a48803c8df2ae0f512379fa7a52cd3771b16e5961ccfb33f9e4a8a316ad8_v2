大殿里立刻活跃起来，大家好像遇到了什么喜事。伽利略等人兴高采烈地从阴暗的一角搬出一具十字火刑架，他们将架上一具焦黑的尸体取下来扔到一边，将火刑架竖起来，另一些人则兴奋地堆木柴。只有达·芬奇对这一切无动于衷。坐在桌边思考着，不时用笔在桌面上计算着什么。\n   “布鲁诺，”亚里士多德指指那具焦尸说，“曾在这里和你一样胡扯一通。”\n   “用文火。”教皇无力地说。\n   两个士兵用耐火的石绵绳将汪淼绑到火刑柱土，汪淼用还能动的一只手指着教皇说：“你肯定是个程序，至于你们其他人，不是程序就是白痴，我还会登录回来的！”\n   “你回不来了，在三体世界中你将永远消失。”伽利略怪笑着说。\n   “那你肯定也是个程序了，一个正常人不可能连这点儿网络常识都没有，这里最多记下我的MAC号，换台电脑换个ID上就行了，到时候我会宣布自己是谁的。”\n   “系统已通过V装具记下了你的视网膜特征。”达·芬奇抬头看了汪淼一眼说，然后埋头继续自己的演算。\n   汪淼突然感到了一阵莫名的恐惧，喊道：“你们不要这样！放我下去！我说的是真理！！”\n   “如果你说的是真理，就不会被烧死了，游戏对走对路的人是一路放行的。”亚里士多德狞笑着，掏出一个银色的Zippo打火机，耍了一个复杂的把戏，锵的一声打着了火。\n   就在他伸手在柴堆上点火时，一道红色的强光从门洞射入，接着涌入一股挟带着烟尘的热浪，一匹马穿透强光跑进大殿，马的躯体在熊熊燃烧，已成了一团火球，奔跑时火焰呼呼作响。马上骑着一个人，是一位穿着重铠的中世纪骑士，他的盔甲已被烧得通红，奔跑时拖着一股白烟。\n   “世界刚刚毁灭！！世界刚刚毁灭！！脱水！！脱水！！”骑士狂呼着，燃烧的坐骑扑通一声栽倒在地，成了一大堆篝火。骑士被甩出好远，一直滚到火刑架下，红炽的盔甲一动不动，只有浓浓的白烟不断地冒出。从盔甲中流出的人油燃烧着在地上扩散开来，仿佛盔甲长出了一对火的翅膀。\n   大殿里的人都奔向洞门，蜂拥而出，很快消失在从门外射入的红光中。汪淼奋力挣脱绳索，绕过燃烧的骑士和马，穿过空荡的大殿，跑过热浪滚滚的门廊，来到外面。\n   大地已经像一块炉中的铁板一样被烧得通红，发出暗红色光的地\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
