His loyalty to the Baron is unwavering, though his ambitions occasionally surface, as seen when he is presented with the choice between capturing Jessica or ruling the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis. Despite his cunning and strategic mind, Piter remains a subordinate to the Baron, executing his will with a blend of intellect and brutality.  \n\nThis consolidated description merges the two provided accounts, emphasizing Piter's dual role as both a Mentat and an assassin, his calculating nature, and his loyalty to the Baron while acknowledging his personal ambitions.
