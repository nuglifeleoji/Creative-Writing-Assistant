These tanks served dual purposes: the production of **gholas** (cloned or resurrected individuals) and the synthesis of **melange** (spice), a substance vital to space travel and longevity. Notably, the Tleilaxu used axlotl tanks to create gholas such as **Duncan Idaho**, showcasing their mastery over genetic manipulation.  \n\nHowever, the Tleilaxu's monopoly over axlotl technology was disrupted after their eventual downfall, leading to the loss of their spice-manufacturing capabilities. Despite this, the **Bene Gesserit**, another powerful faction, later adopted and repurposed the axlotl tanks for their own ends, continuing the legacy of the technology. The tanks remain a testament to the Tleilaxu's ingenuity, even as their original creators faded into obscurity.  \n\nIn summary, the **axlotl tanks** were a pivotal Tleilaxu innovation, enabling ghola production and spice synthesis until their destruction. Though the Tleilaxu's spice-making ability was lost, the Bene Gesserit preserved the technology, ensuring its continued influence in the *Dune* universe.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751252009, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 524, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
