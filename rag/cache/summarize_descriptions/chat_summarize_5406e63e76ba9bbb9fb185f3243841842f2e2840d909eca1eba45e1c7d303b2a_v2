They operate within the **Tleilaxu society**, led by figures such as **Waff** and later **Scytale**, and are deeply committed to their **Great Belief**, viewing genetic manipulation as the \"language of God.\" Their technological prowess extends to **axlotl tanks** (biological vats for reproduction and melange production) and **Tleilaxu tank-grown melange**, making them key players in trade and political strategies.  \n\nHistorically, the Bene Tleilax **harbored Mentats** and engaged in conflicts with other factions, notably opposing **Paul Atreides** and clashing with the **Bene Gesserit**, whom they rival in influence. Their actions, including an **assassination attempt on Leto II** during the Festival, led to violent reprisals from the **Fish Speakers**, highlighting their precarious position within Letoâ€™s Empire. Despite their amoral reputation, they pursue alliances and religious expansion, often through covert means.  \n\nThe faction is internally divided between **Masters** and **Face Dancers**, with notable creations like **Hayt** (a ghola of Duncan Idaho) and **Bijaz** (a human distrans). Their projects span scientific, religious, and espionage endeavors, reflecting their multifaceted ambitions.
