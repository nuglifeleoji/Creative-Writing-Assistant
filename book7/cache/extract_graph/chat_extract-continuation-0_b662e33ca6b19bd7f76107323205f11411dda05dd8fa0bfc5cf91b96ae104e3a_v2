\"是啊，他们都已经离婚了，现在根本毫不相干。她有什么理由杀害他。\"\n    \"当然，站在我们的立场，基本上也是这么想的。\"\n    \"这话是什么意思？\"\n    \"世上有各种各样的夫妻，所以也有很多事不光以某种形式就能解决的。如果说分手之后的隔天起就能断绝关系，彼此互不干涉，彼此形同陌路，那就不会有变态跟踪狂了，问题是现实并非如此。一方想断绝关系另一方却迟迟不肯放手的情形，多得数不清，纵使已经办妥离婚手续也一样。\"\n    \"她说，她和富坚先生已经很久没见面了。\"工藤的眼中开始酝酿着敌意。\n    \"您和花冈小姐谈过这起命案吗？\"\n

\"关心？我不太懂你的意思。你既然会来找我，就表示你应该知道我和她的关系吧？我曾经是她上班那家店的常客。跟她先生，也见过面--虽说是出于偶然。我也是在那时听说，富坚这个名字。所以听说那起命案后，而且新闻连富坚先生的照片都登了出来，我才会在担心之下去探望她。\"\n    \"我已听说您曾是常客。不过光是这点，一般人会做到这种地步吗？工藤先生是公司的大老板吧？照理说应该是个大忙人才对。\"草S故意语带讽刺，基于职业所需，他常这样讲话。不过他其实不喜欢这种说话方式。\n    草S这招似乎见效了，工藤顿时怒形于色。\n    \"你不是说要来问花冈靖子的事吗？可是你一直质问我私人的事，难道你在怀疑我？\"\n    \"没那回事，如果惹您不快我愿意道歉。只是，我看花冈小姐现在好像跟您走得特别近，所以才想顺便问您几句。\"\n    草S这番话说得四平八稳，但工藤依旧狠狠瞪着他。工藤用力深呼吸后，点个头说道：\"我知道了。被这样迂回刺探的感觉很不愉快，所以我就干脆直说吧，我的确对她有意思，是男女之间的�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
