It encompasses two interconnected aspects: his removal from the evolutionary succession and his transformation into the **Divided God**, which also led to the creation of **sandtrout**.  \n\nInitially, the Holy Metamorphosis marks Leto II's departure from the established path of human evolution, signifying a deliberate break from his role as a guiding force. This shift is not merely physical but also symbolic, representing a fundamental change in his relationship with humanity and the broader cosmic order.  \n\nSimultaneously, the Holy Metamorphosis describes Leto II's physical transformation into the **Divided God**, a state where his consciousness fragments while his body merges with sandtrout—small, worm-like creatures integral to the desert ecosystem of Arrakis. This process ensures his legacy persists in a dispersed form, influencing future events beyond his direct rule.  \n\nWhile the descriptions differ slightly—one emphasizing his removal from evolution and the other focusing on his physical transformation—they are not contradictory. Instead, they reflect different dimensions of the same event: the Holy Metamorphosis represents both an ideological and biological shift, marking the end of Leto II's centralized rule and the beginning of a new phase in the universe's unfolding destiny.  \n\nIn summary, the **Holy Metamorphosis** is the moment when **Leto II** transcends his singular existence, withdrawing from evolutionary guidance while undergoing a profound physical change that disperses his essence into sandtrout, ensuring his enduring influence on the cosmos.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2266,SHEEANA,DIVIDED GOD,Sheeana is revered as a 'Child of God' connected to the Divided God,63\r\n2332,HOLY METAMORPHOSIS,DIVIDED GOD,The Holy Metamorphosis describes the transformation of Leto II into the Divided God,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
