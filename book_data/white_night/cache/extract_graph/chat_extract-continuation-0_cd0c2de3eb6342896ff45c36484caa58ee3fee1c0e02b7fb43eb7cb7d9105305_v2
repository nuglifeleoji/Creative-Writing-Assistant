��轩宇似乎感觉到外面的世界似乎有很多光点围绕着自己。这些光点之中，以银色为主。这是他从未见到过的。\n------------\n\n第二十七章 唐乐出道\n\n    以前在修炼的过程中，蓝轩宇最多能够感觉到的都是蓝色光点，这些银色光点却还是第一次出现。\n\n    银色光点对他也很亲和，围绕在他身体周围盘旋，只是却似乎无法对它们进行引导。这些银色是什么呢？\n\n    这次冥想的时间相当不短，等他从修炼中清醒过来的时候，南澄告诉他，他足足冥想了超过六个小时。要知道，在太空之中的修炼效果其实不太好，因为各种天地元力没有基于星球的存在，在真空中是十分稀薄的。太空冥想，更多的是为了打发时间罢了。\n\n    “妈妈，我看到了许多银色光点，那是什么啊？”蓝轩宇向南澄问出了疑惑。\n\n    “银色光点？你感受到空间元素了？”南澄身为魂帝级强者，当然知道银色在元素之中代表着什么。她自己是冰元素掌控，儿子是水元素掌控。按道理来说，是不应该能够感受到空间元素才对的啊！\n\n    “那是空间元素么？”蓝轩宇有些茫然的问道。\n\n    南澄点了点头，道：“是的。银色代表着空间元素。事实上，在太空之中，最多的也是空间元素。宇宙飞船的高速行驶，再加上太空中的空间变化，都会产生出比星球上更加浓郁的空间元素。所以，拥有空间属性类型武魂的魂师，他们经常愿意在太空中修炼。而这样的魂师，考入战舰驾驶系的加分是很多的。更好的感受空间，对于战舰驾驶员很重要。看起来，我儿子也很有这方面天赋呢。”\n\n    “是吗？那我更要做战舰驾驶员了呢！”蓝轩宇再次为自己立下志向。\n\n    冥想确实是打发时间最好的方法，除此之外，还有魂导电视可以看。有新闻、电影、电视之类，给无聊的旅程打发时间。\n\n    “爸爸，你在看什么呢？”蓝轩宇把头探到蓝潇那边。\n\n    “爸爸在看新闻啊！是母星的新闻。自由在宇宙飞船上，才能看到其他星球的新闻。这可是不可多得的机会。”蓝潇向儿子解释道。\n\n    “哦。”蓝轩宇眨了眨大眼睛，看着父亲面前的屏幕。蓝潇略微调大了一点声音。\n\n    “你还有这兴致？这是明星发布会吧？”南澄也探头过来，看向蓝潇面前的屏幕。\n\n    屏幕上，正是一个发布会的新闻。\n\n    “星唐传媒最近宣布，签约一名全新艺人唐乐。经纪人乐卿灵。据悉，星唐传媒内部已经决定要重金打造这位新星。今天专门为他举办本次发布会，也充分证实了这一点。星唐传媒乃是母星最大的传媒集团之一\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
