�掉就行……”\n　　“谢谢!”汪淼抓过相机和胶卷，匆匆返回屋里。其实家里还有三架胶卷相机和一架数码相机，但汪淼觉得从别处借更可靠些。他看着摊放在沙发上的两架相机和几只黑白胶卷，略一思考后，又给莱卡装上了胶卷，然后将数码相机递给正在端饭的妻子：\n　　“快，拍几张，就像刚才一样!”\n　　“这是干什么?看你的脸色……你到底怎么了?!”妻子惊恐地望着他。\n　　“你别管，拍!”\n　　妻子放下手中的碟子，走过来看着丈夫，眼中的惊恐又加上了忧虑。\n　　汪淼把柯达相机塞到过来吃饭的六岁儿子手里， “豆豆，你帮爸爸拍。就按这个，对，这是一张；再按一下，对对，又是一张；就这样。一直拍，对着哪儿都行。”\n　　儿子很快掌握了，小家伙很感兴趣，拍得很快。汪淼转身从沙发上拿起自己的莱卡，也拍了起来，父子俩就这样“咔嚓、咔嚓”地疯狂拍着，丢下妻子在频频闪光中不知所措，眼泪涌了出来。\n　　“汪淼，我知道你最近工作压力很大，你可别……”\n　　汪淼把莱卡相机的胶卷拍完，又从孩子手中抢过数码相机。他想了一下，为了避开妻儿的干扰，走到卧室中，自己用数码相机也拍了几张。他拍的时候用的是目视取景器，没用液晶屏，因为怕看到结果，虽然迟早要看。\n　　汪淼取出莱卡里的胶卷钻进暗室，紧紧地关上门工作起来。冲洗完成后，他细看底片，因手在颤抖，他只能用双手握着放大镜——底片上，幽灵倒计时在继续。\n　　汪淼冲出暗室，开始检查数码相机上的照片，从液晶屏上看到，刚才拍的数码照片中，儿子拍的部分没有显示倒计时；而在自己拍的那部分，倒计时清晰地显示出来，并且与底片上的同步变化。\n　　汪淼使用不同的相机拍摄，目的是排除问题出在相机或底片上的可能性，但他无意中让孩子拍摄，加上之前让妻子拍摄，得出了一个更加诡异的结果：用不同相机和不同胶卷拍摄，别人拍出的都正常，幽灵倒计时只会在他拍摄的照片上出现!\n　　汪淼绝望地抓起那堆胶卷，像抓着一团纠缠在一起的蛇，又像一团难以挣脱的绞索。\n　　他知道，仅凭自己的力量是无法解决这个问题的，那么去找谁呢?大学和研究所里的同事是不行的，他们与自己一样，都是技术型思维的人；直觉告诉他，这件事已超出了技术之外。他想到了丁仪，可现在这人自己也陷入精神危机之中。他最后想到了“\n######################\nOutput:",
