Duncan, a recurring ghola with restored memories, seeks Sheeana’s expertise in ghola memory restoration techniques, highlighting her specialized knowledge in this area. Their relationship extends beyond mere collaboration, as Sheeana serves as Duncan’s confidante, engaging in discussions about the Tyrant, a topic of profound significance to both.  \n\nTheir alliance is multifaceted: Sheeana aids Duncan in evading surveillance, demonstrating her tactical acumen and willingness to operate outside strict Bene Gesserit protocols. Additionally, she practices Honored Matre techniques, suggesting a blending of methodologies and a potential alignment with or adaptation of rival factions’ strategies. This dynamic underscores the complexity of their partnership, which balances loyalty to the Bene Gesserit’s goals with independent maneuvering.  \n\nTogether, Duncan Idaho and Sheeana navigate a web of political intrigue, shared secrets, and mutual reliance, making them central to the Bene Gesserit’s long-term designs while also forging their own path.
