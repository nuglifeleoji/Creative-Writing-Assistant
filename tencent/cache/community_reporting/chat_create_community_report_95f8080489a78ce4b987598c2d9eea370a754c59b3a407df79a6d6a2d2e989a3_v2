One character is driven by a vow to fight against humanity, a commitment rooted in their experiences of suffering and isolation.

The narrator's dreams serve as a psychological escape from the harsh realities they encounter, offering a temporary reprieve from their struggles.\n\nAdditionally, the narrator's academic pursuits focus on the study of human decomposition, which is closely tied to their experiences in graveyards and mortuaries.
