\n　　从田家圪崂的公路上下去，墙过东拉河，穿过三角洲枣林中的一条小路，就是和东拉河在庙前交汇的哭咽河。这河虽然小，但来历不凡。传说古时候这沟里并没有水。那时天上玉皇大帝一位下凡游乐人间的女儿到了这里，爱上了一位姓金的后生，竟然推迟了归天的日期。后来玉皇大帝大发雷霆，命令她立即上天，如在两天之内还不上来，他就要把这位女儿就地变成一座土山。但仙女不能割舍人间的爱恋，违抗了父命。她发誓，即是化作人间的泥土，也要厮守在情人的身边。两天之后，她就变成了一座普通的黄土山。她那人间的爱人悲痛欲绝，日日在她变成的土山下面，跪着呜咽哭啼，直至死在这山脚下。传说正是他的眼泪流成了这条小河。人们把仙女变成的土山叫做神仙山，把这条泪水流成的小河叫哭咽河…… \n　　这当然是金家老祖上编出来的神话，以光耀自己的家族。正因为如此，金家的祖坟就扎在哭咽河北岸的神仙山下，那坟地已不知安葬了多少代姓金的人，密密麻麻一大片。坟地上不知哪一辈人栽了些柏树，现在已象桶一般粗壮。得到冬天，大地一片荒凉的时候，远远近近，只有那些柏树绿森森的，特别惹眼。 \n　　正因为有东拉河和哭咽河，这村子才取名双水村。 \n　　在哭咽河上，有一座几步就能跨过的小桥。村里现在最高寿的人，也不知这小桥是什么年间建造的。它年年摇摇欲坠，但年年都存在着。 \n　　过了哭咽河这座小桥，就是金家湾。除过少数几家杂姓，大都住着金姓人家。一道阳湾里，家户住得密密麻麻，相当拥挤。只是在隔过金家祖坟的后山嘴那里，单另还有两大户人家，都姓金：一大户是二队长金俊武弟兄三家；另一大户是地主成份的金光亮弟兄三家。 \n　　古时候，旧社会，金家一直是双水村的主宰。这片土地和土地上的一切，都属于金家。据传在宋、明两个朝代里，这金家曾出过几个名震州府的大地主，想必他们当时占有的土地，已经远远超出了双水村的范围。但据说明末的时候，蒙古鄂尔多斯那一带的胡人，曾经大规模入侵到这里，把这家大地主连杀带抢，家业基本踢踏光了，后来就再也没有发达起来。到土改的时候，金家除一家订了地主，两家订了富农成份外，一部分是中农，大部分都还是贫下中农成份。
