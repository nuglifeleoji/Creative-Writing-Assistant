The two spent time together in deep discussion, wearing mourning robes, suggesting a period of mutual respect or shared grief. However, their interactions took a dark turn when Duncan Idaho provoked Stilgar to rage, leading to a fatal confrontation. In a fit of anger, Stilgar killed Duncan Idaho, an act that likely stemmed from the escalating tension between them. This event not only ended Duncan's life but also influenced Stilgar's subsequent actions, though the specifics of those actions remain unclear. The contradictory descriptions—ranging from peaceful discourse to lethal violence—highlight the volatile nature of their dynamic, where moments of unity could swiftly give way to irreversible conflict.
