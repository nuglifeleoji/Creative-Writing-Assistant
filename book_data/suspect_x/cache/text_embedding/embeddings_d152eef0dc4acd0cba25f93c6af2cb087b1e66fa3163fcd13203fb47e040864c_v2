Lord?”\n“Yes.”\n“Should anything be done about the Tleilaxu stories which...”\n“Nothing.”\nShe stared at him, remembering their earlier conversation. The seeds of dissolution were being planted.\n“It is my fear, Lord, that | will weaken you,” she said.\n“Then you must find ways to strengthen me.”\n“Can it strengthen you if we diminish belief in the God Leto?”\nHe heard a hint of Malky in her voice, that measured weighing which had made him so revoltingly charming. We never completely escape the teachers of our childhood.\n“Your question begs the answer,” he said. “Many will continue to worship according to my design. Others will believe the lies.”\n“Lord... would you ask me to lie for you?”\n“Of course not. But I will ask you to remain silent when you might wish to speak.”\n“But if they revile...”\n“You will not protest.”\nOnce more, tears flowed down her cheeks. Leto longed to touch them, but they were water... painful water.\n“It must be done this way,” he said.\n“Will you explain it to me, Lord?”\n“When | am gone, they must call me Shaitan, the Emperor of Gehenna. The wheel must turn and turn and turn along the Golden Path.”\n“Lord, could the anger not be directed at me alone? | would not...”\n“No! The Ixians made you much more perfectly than they thought. | truly love you. | cannot help it.”\n“I do not wish to cause you pain!” The words were wrenched from her.\n“What’s done is done. Do not mourn it.”\n“Help me to understand.”\n“The hate which will blossom after | am gone, that, too, will fade into the inevitable past. A long time will pass. Then, on a far-distant day, my journals will be found.”\n“Journals?” She was shaken by the seeming shift of Subject.\n“My chronicle of my time. My arguments, the apologia. Copies exist and scattered fragments will survive, some in distorted form, but the original journals will wait and wait and wait. | have hidden them well.”\n“And when they are discovered?”\n“People will learn that | was something quite different from what they supposed.”\nHer voice came in a trembling hush. “I already know what they will learn.”\n“Yes, my darling Hwi, | think you do.”\n“You are neither devil nor god, but something never seen before and never to be seen again because your presence removes the need.”\nShe brushed tears from her cheeks.\n“Hwi, do you realize how dangerous you are?”\nAlarm showed in her expression, the tensing of her arms.\n“You have the makings of a saint,” he said. “Do you understand how painful it can be to find a saint in the wrong place and the wrong time?”\nShe shook her head.\n“People have to be prepared for saints,” he said. “Otherwise, they simply become followers, supplicants, beggars and weakened sycophants forever in the shadow of the saint. People are destroyed by this because it nurtures only weakness.”\nAfter a moment of thought, she nodded, then: “Will there be saints when you are gone?”\n“That’s the purpose of my Golden Path.”\n“Moneo’s daughter, Siona, will she...”\n“For now She is only a rebel. As to sainthood, we will let her decide. Perhaps she will only do what she was bred to do.”\n“What is that, Lord?”\n“Stop calling me Lord,” he said. “We will be Worm and wife. Call me Leto if you wish. Lord interferes.”\n“Yes, L... Leto. But what is...”\n“Siona was bred to rule. There is danger in such breeding. When you rule, you gain knowledge of power. This can lead into impetuous irresponsibility, into painful excesses and that can lead to the terrible destroyer—wild hedonism.”\n“Siona would...”\n“All we Know about Siona is that she can remain dedicated to a particular performance, to the pattern which fills her senses. She is necessarily an aristocrat, but aristocracy looks mostly to the past. That’s a failure. You don’t see much of any path unless you are Janus, looking simultaneously backward and forward.”\n“Janus? Oh, yes, the god with the two opposed faces.” She wet her lips with her tongue. “Are you Janus, Leto?”\n“I am Janus magnified a billionfold. And | am also something less. | have been, for example, what my administrators admire most—the decision-maker whose every decision can be made to work.”\n“But if you fail them...”\n“They will turn against me, yes.”\n“Will Siona replace you if...”\n“Ahhh, what an enormous if! You observe that Siona threatens my person. However, she does not threaten the Golden Path. There is also the fact that my Fish Speakers have a certain attachment to the Duncan.”\n“Siona seems... SO young.”\n“And | am her favorite poseur, the sham who holds power under false pretenses, never consulting the needs of his people.”\n“Could | not talk to her and...”\n“No! You must never try to persuade Siona of anything. Promise me, Hwi.”\n“If you ask it, of course, but I...”\n“All gods have this problem, Hwi. In the perception of deeper needs, | must often ignore immediate ones. Not addressing immediate needs is an offense to the young.”\n“Could you not reason with her and...”\n“Never attempt to reason with people who know they are right!”\n“But when you know they are wrong...”\n“Do you believe in me?”\n“Yes.”\n“And if someone tried to convince you that | am the greatest evil of all time...”\n“I would become very angry. | would . . .” She broke off. “Reason is valuable,” he said, “only when it performs against the wordless physical background of the universe.”\nHer brows drew together in thought. It fascinated Leto to sense the arousal of her awareness. “Ahhhh.” She breathed the word.\n“No reasoning creature will ever again be able to deny the Leto experience,” he said. “I see your understanding begin. Beginnings! They are what life is all about!”\nShe nodded.\nNo arguments, he thought. When she sees the tracks, she follows them to find where they will lead.\n“As long as there is life, every ending is a beginning,” he said. “And | would save humankind, even from itself.”\nAgain, she nodded. The tracks still led onward.\n“This is why no death in the perpetuation of humankind can be a complete failure,” he said. “This is why a birth touches us so deeply. This is why the most tragic death is the death of a youth.”\n“Does Ix still threaten your Golden Path? I’ve always known they conspired in something evil.”\nThey conspire. Hwi does not hear the inner message of her own words. She has no need to hear it.\nHe stared at her, full of the marvel that was Hwi. She possessed a form of honesty which some would call naive, but which Leto recognized as merely non-self-conscious. The honesty was not her core, it was Hwi herself.\n“Then | will arrange a performance in the plaza tomorrow,” Leto said. “It will be a performance of the surviving Face Dancers. Afterward, our betrothal will be announced.”\nLet there be no doubt that | am the assemblage of our ancestors, the arena in which they exercise my moments. They are my cells and | am their body. This is the favrashi of which | speak, the soul, the collective unconscious, the source of archetypes, the repository of all trauma and joy. | am the choice of their awakening. My samhadi is their samhadi. Their experiences are mine! Their knowledge distilled is my inheritance. Those billions are my one.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe Face Dancer performance occupied almost two hours of the morning, and afterward came the announcement which sent shock waves through the Festival City.\n“It has been centuries since he took a bride!”\n“More than a thousand years, my dear.”\nThe trooping of the Fish Speakers had been brief. They cheered him loudly, but they were disturbed.\n“You are my only brides,” he had said. Was that not the meaning of Siaynoq?\nLeto thought the Face Dancers performed well despite their obvious terror. Garments had been found in the depths of a Fremen museum—hooded black robes with white cord belts, soread-winged green hawks appliquéd across the shoulders at the back—uniforms of Muad’Dib’s itinerant priests. The Face Dancers had put on dark, seamed faces with these robes and performed a dance which told how Muad’Dib’s legions had spread their religion through the Empire.\nHwi, wearing a brilliant silver dress with a green jade necklace, sat beside Leto on the Royal Cart throughout the ritual. Once, she leaned close to his face and asked: “Is that not a parody?”\n“To me, perhaps.”\n“Do the Face Dancers know?”\n“They suspect.”\n“Then they are not as frightened as they appear.”\n“Oh, yes, they are frightened. It’s just that they are braver than most people expect them to be.”\n“Bravery can be so foolish,” she whispered.\n“And vice-versa.”\nShe had favored him with a measuring stare before returning her attention to the performance. Almost two hundred Face Dancers had survived unscathed. All of them had been pressed into the dance. The intricate weavings and posturings could fascinate the eye. It was possible to watch them and, for a time, forget the bloody preliminaries to this day.\nLeto remembered this as he lay alone in his small reception room shortly before noon when Moneo arrived. Moneo had seen the Reverend Mother Anteac onto a Guild lighter, had conferred with the Fish Speaker Command about the previous night’s violence, had made a quick flight to the Citadel and back to make sure Siona was under a secure watch and that she had not been implicated in the Embassy attack. He had returned to Onn just after the betrothal announcement, having had no previous warning.\nMoneo was furious. Leto had never seen him this angry. He stormed into the room and stopped only two meters from Leto’s face.\n“Now the Tleilaxu lies will be believed!” he said.\nLeto responded in a reasoned tone. “How persistent it is, this demand that our gods be perfect. The Greeks were much more reasonable about such things.”\n“Where is she?” Moneo demanded. “Where is this...”\n“Hwi is resting. It was a difficult night and a long morning. | want her well rested when we return to the Citadel this evening.”\n“How did she work this?” Moneo demanded.\n“Really, Moneo! Have you lost all sense of caution?”\n“I am concerned about you! Have you any idea what they’re saying in the City?”\n“I’m fully aware of the stories.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“You know, Moneo, | think that only the old pantheists had the right idea about deities: mortal foibles in immortal guise.”\nMoneo raised both arms to the heavens. “I saw the looks on their faces!” He lowered his arms. “It'll be all over the Empire within two weeks.”\n“Surely it'll take longer than that.”\n“If your enemies needed one thing to bring them all together...”\n“The defiling of the god is an ancient human tradition, Moneo. Why should | be an exception?”\nMoneo tried to speak, found he could not utter", " | want her well rested when we return to the Citadel this evening.”\n“How did she work this?” Moneo demanded.\n“Really, Moneo! Have you lost all sense of caution?”\n“I am concerned about you! Have you any idea what they’re saying in the City?”\n“I’m fully aware of the stories.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“You know, Moneo, | think that only the old pantheists had the right idea about deities: mortal foibles in immortal guise.”\nMoneo raised both arms to the heavens. “I saw the looks on their faces!” He lowered his arms. “It'll be all over the Empire within two weeks.”\n“Surely it'll take longer than that.”\n“If your enemies needed one thing to bring them all together...”\n“The defiling of the god is an ancient human tradition, Moneo. Why should | be an exception?”\nMoneo tried to speak, found he could not utter a word. He stamped down along the edge of the pit which held Leto’s cart, stamped back and resumed his former position glaring into Leto’s face.\n“If I am to help you, | need an explanation,” Moneo said. “Why are you doing this?”\n“Emotions.”\nMoneo’s mouth formed the word without speaking it.\n“They have come over me just when | thought them gone forever,” Leto said. “How sweet these last few sips of humanity are.”\n“With Hwi? But you surely cannot...”\n“Memories of emotions are never enough, Moneo.”\n“Are you telling me that you are indulging yourself in Buf at “Indulgence? Certainly not! But the tripod upon which Eternity swings is composed of flesh and thought and emotion. | felt that | had been reduced to flesh and thought.”\n“She has worked some kind of witchery,” Moneo accused.\n“Of course she has. And how grateful | am for it. If we deny the need for thought, Moneo, as some do, we lose the powers of reflection; we cannot define what our senses report. If we deny the flesh, we unwheel the vehicle which bears us. But if we deny emotion, we lose all touch with our internal universe. It was emotions which | missed the most.”\n“lL insist, Lord, that you...”\n“You are making me angry, Moneo. That /s an emotion.” Leto saw Moneo’s frustrated fury cool, quenched like a hot iron plunged into icy water. There was still some steam\nin him, though.\n“| care not for myself, Lord. My concern is mostly for you, and you know this.”\nLeto spoke softly. “It is your emotion, Moneo, and | hold it dear.”\nMoneo inhaled a deep, trembling breath. He had never before seen the God Emperor in this mood, reflecting this emotion. Leto appeared both elated and resigned, if Moneo were reading it correctly. One could not be certain.\n“That which makes life sweet for the living,” Leto said, “that which makes life warm and filled with beauty, that is what | would preserve even though it were denied to me.”\n“Then this Hwi Noree.. .”\n“She makes me recall the Butlerian Jihad in a poignant way. She is the antithesis of all that’s mechanical and non- human. How odd it is, Moneo, that the Ixians, of all people, Should produce this one person who so perfectly embodies those qualities which | hold most dear.”\n“I do not understand your reference to the Butlerian Jihad, Lord. Machines that think have no place in...”\n“The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,” Leto said. “Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.”\n“Lord, | still resent the fact that you welcome this...”\n“Moneo! Hwi reassures me merely by her presence. For the first time in centuries, | am not lonely unless she is away from my side. If | had no other proof of the emotion, this would serve.”\nMoneo fell silent, obviously touched by Leto’s evocation of loneliness. Surely, Moneo could understand the absence of the intimate sharing in love. His expression betrayed as much.\nFor the first time in a long while, Leto noted how much Moneo had aged.\nIt happens so suddenly to them, Leto thought.\nIt made Leto deeply aware of how much he cared for Moneo.\n| should not let attachments happen to me, but I cannot help it... especially now that Hwi is here.\n“They will laugh at you and make obscene jests,” Moneo said.\n“That is a good thing.”\n“How can it be good?”\n“This is something new. Our task has always been to bring the new into balance and, with it, modify behavior while not suppressing survival.”\n“Even so, how can you welcome this?”\n“The making of obscenities?” Leto asked. “What is the opposite of obscenity?”\nMoneo’s eyes went wide with a sudden questioning awareness. He had seen the action of many polarities—the thing made known by its opposite.\nThe thing stands out against a background which defines it, Leto thought. Surely Moneo will see this.\n“It’s too dangerous,” Moneo said.\nThe ultimate verdict of conservatism!\nMoneo was not convinced. A deep sigh wracked him.\nI must remember not to take away their doubts, Leto thought. That’s how | failed my Fish Speakers in the plaza.\nThe Ixians are holding on to the ragged end of human doubts. Hwi is the evidence of that.\nA disturbance sounded in the anteroom. Leto sealed the portal against impetuous intrusions.\n“My Duncan has come,” he said.\n“He’s probably heard about your wedding plans—”\n“Probably.”\nLeto watched Moneo wrestle with doubts, his thoughts utterly transparent. In that moment, Moneo fit so precisely into his human niche that Leto wanted to hug him.\nHe has the full spectrum: doubt-to-trust, love-to-hate.. . everything! All of those dear qualities which come to fruition in the warmth of emotion, in the willingness to soend yourself on Life.\n“Why is Hwi accepting this?” Moneo asked.\nLeto smiled. Moneo cannot doubt me; he must doubt others.\n“I admit it is not a conventional union. She is a primate and I no longer am fully primate.”\nAgain, Moneo wrestled with things he could only feel and not express.\nWatching Moneo, Leto felt the flow of an observational- awareness, a thought process which occurred so rarely but with such vivid amplification when it did occur, that Leto did not stir lest he cause a ripple in the flow.\nThe primate thinks and, by thinking, survives. Beneath his thinking is a thing which came with his cells. It is the current of human concerns for the species. Sometimes, they cover it up, wall it off and hide it behind thick barriers, but | have deliberately sensitized Moneo to these workings of his innermost self. He follows me because he believes I hold the best course for human survival. He knows there is a cellular awareness. It is what I find when I scan the Golden Path. This is humanity and both of us agree: it must endure!\n“Where, when and how will the wedding ceremony be conducted?” Moneo asked.\nNot why? Leto noted. Moneo no longer sought to understand the why. He had returned to safe ground. He was the majordomo, the director of the God Emperor’s household, the First Minister.\nHe has names and verbs and modifiers with which he can perform. The words will work for him in their usual ways. Moneo may never glimpse the transcendental potential of his words, but he well understands their everyday, mundane uses.\n“What of my question?” Moneo pressed.\nLeto blinked at him, thinking: /, on the other hand, feel that words are mostly useful if they open for me a glimpse of attractive and undiscovered places. But the use of words is so little understood by a civilization which still believes unquestioningly in a mechanical universe of absolute cause and effect—obviously reducible to one single root-cause and one primary seminal-effect.\n“How like a limpet the Ixian-Tleilaxu fallacy clings to human affairs,” Leto said.\n“Lord, it disturbs me deeply when you don’t pay attention.”\n“But | do pay attention, Moneo.”\n“Not to me.”\n“Even to you.”\n“Your attention wanders, Lord. You do not have to conceal that from me. | would betray myself before | would betray you.”\n“You think I’m woolgathering?”\n“Whatgathering, Lord?” Moneo had never questioned this word earlier, but now...\nLeto explained the allusion, thinking: How ancient! The looms and shuttles clicked in Leto’s memory. Animal fur to human garments... huntsman to herdsman... the long steps up the ladder of awareness... and now they must make another long step, longer even than the ancient ones.\n“You indulge in idle thoughts,” Moneo accused.\n“I have time for idle thoughts. That’s one of the most interesting things about my existence as a singular multitude.”\n“But, Lord, there are matters which demand our...”\n“You'd be surprised what comes of idle thinking, Moneo. I’ve never minded spending an entire day on things a human would not bother with for one minute. Why not? With my life expectancy of some four thousand years, what’s one day more or less? How much time does one human life count? A million minutes? I’ve already experienced almost that many days.”\nMoneo stood frozen in silence, diminished by this comparison. He felt his own lifetime reduced to a mote in Leto’s eye. The source of the allusion did not escape him.\nWords... words... words, Moneo thought.\n“Words are often almost useless in sentient affairs,” Leto said.\nMoneo held his breathing to a shallow minimum. The Lord can read thoughts!\n“Throughout our history,” Leto said, “the most potent use of words has been to round out some transcendental event, giving that event a place in the accepted chronicles, explaining the event in such a way that ever afterward we can use those words and say: “This is what it meant.”\nMoneo felt beaten down by these words, terrified by unspoken things they might make him think.\n“That’s how events get lost in history,” Leto said.\nAfter a long silence, Moneo ventured: “You have not answered my question, Lord. The wedding?”\nHow tired he sounds, Leto thought. How utterly defeated.\nLeto spoke briskly: “I have never needed your good offices more. The wedding must be managed with utmost care. It must have the precision of which only you are capable.”\n“Where, Lord?”\nA bit more life in his voice.\n“At Tabur Village in the Sareer.”\n“When?”\n“Į leave the date to you. Announce it when all things are arranged.”\n“And the ceremony itself?”\n“I will conduct it.”\n“Will you need assistants, Lord? Artifacts of any kind?”\n“The trappings of ritual?”\n“Any particular thing which | may not...”\n“We will not need much for our little charade.”\n“Lord! | beg of you! Please...”\n“You will stand beside the bride and give her in marriage,” Leto said. “We will use the Old Fremen ritual.”\n“We will need water rings then,” Moneo said.\n“Yes! | will use Ghani’s water rings.”\n“And who will attend, Lord?”\n“Only a", "I have never needed your good offices more. The wedding must be managed with utmost care. It must have the precision of which only you are capable.”\n“Where, Lord?”\nA bit more life in his voice.\n“At Tabur Village in the Sareer.”\n“When?”\n“Į leave the date to you. Announce it when all things are arranged.”\n“And the ceremony itself?”\n“I will conduct it.”\n“Will you need assistants, Lord? Artifacts of any kind?”\n“The trappings of ritual?”\n“Any particular thing which | may not...”\n“We will not need much for our little charade.”\n“Lord! | beg of you! Please...”\n“You will stand beside the bride and give her in marriage,” Leto said. “We will use the Old Fremen ritual.”\n“We will need water rings then,” Moneo said.\n“Yes! | will use Ghani’s water rings.”\n“And who will attend, Lord?”\n“Only a Fish Speaker guard and the aristocracy.”\nMoneo stared at Leto’s face. “What... what does my Lord mean by ‘aristocracy’?”\n“You, your family, the household entourage, the courtiers of the Citadel.”\n“My fam...” Moneo swallowed. “Do you include Siona?” “If she survives the test.” “But sa ve\n“Is she not family?”\n“Of course, Lord. She is Atreides and...”\n“Then by all means include Siona!”\nMoneo brought a tiny memocorder from his pocket, a dull black Ixian artifact whose existence crowded the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad. A soft smile touched Leto’s lips. Moneo knew his duties and would now perform them.\nThe clamor of Duncan Idaho outside the portal grew more strident, but Moneo ignored the sound.\nMoneo knows the price of his privileges, Leto thought. /t is another kind of marriage—the marriage of privilege and\nduty. It is the aristocrat’s explanation and his excuse.\nMoneo finished his note taking.\n“A few details, Lord,” Moneo said. “Will there be some special garb for Hwi?”\n“The stillsuit and robe of a Fremen bride, real ones.”\n“Jewelry or other baubles?”\nLeto’s gaze locked on Moneo’s fingers scrabbling over the tiny recorder, seeing there a dissolution.\nLeadership, courage, a sense of knowledge and order— Moneo has these in abundance. They surround him like a holy aura, but they conceal from all eyes except mine the rot which eats from within. It is inevitable. Were | gone, it would be visible to everyone.\n“Lord?” Moneo pressed. “Are you woolgathering?”\nAhhh! He likes that word!\n“That is all,” Leto said. “Only the robe, the stillsuit and the water rings.”\nMoneo bowed and turned away.\nHe is looking ahead now, Leto thought, but even this new thing will pass. He will turn toward the past once more. And | had such high hopes for him once. Well... perhaps Siona...\n“Make no heroes,” my father said.\n—THE VOICE OF GHANIMA, FROM THE ORAL HISTORY\nust by the way Idaho strode across the small chamber, his\nloud demands for audience now gratified, Leto could see an important transformation in the ghola. It was a thing repeated so many times that it had become deeply familiar to Leto. The Duncan had not even exchanged words of greeting with the departing Moneo. It all fitted into the pattern. How boring that pattern had become!\nLeto had a name for this transformation of the Duncans. He called it “The Since Syndrome.”\nThe gholas often nurtured suspicions about the secret things which might have been developed across the centuries of oblivion since they last knew awareness. What had people been doing all that time? Why could they possibly want me, this relic from their past? No ego could overcome such doubts forever—especially in a doubting man.\nOne of the gholas had accused Leto: “You’ve put things in my body, things | know nothing about! These things in my body tell you everything I’m doing! You spy on me everywhere!”\nAnother had charged him with possessing a “manipulative machine which makes us want to do whatever you want.”\nOnce it started, the Since Syndrome could never be entirely eliminated. It could be checked, even diverted, but the dormant seed might sprout at the slightest provocation.\nIdaho stopped where Moneo had stood and there was a veiled look of nonspecific suspicions in his eyes, in the set of his shoulders. Leto allowed the situation to simmer, bringing the condition to a head. Idaho locked gazes with him, then broke away to dart his glances around the room. Leto recognized the manner behind the gaze.\nThe Duncans never forget!\nAs he studied the room, using the sightful ways he had been taught centuries before by the Lady Jessica and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, Idaho began to feel a giddy sense of dislocation. He thought the room rejected him, each thing— the soft cushions: big bulbous things in gold, green anda red that was almost purple; the Fremen rugs, each a museum piece, lapping over each other in thick piles around Leto’s pit; the false sunlight of Ixian glowglobes, light which enveloped the Emperor’s face in dry warmth, making the shadows around it deeper and more mysterious; the smell of spice-tea somewhere nearby; and that rich melange odor which radiated from the worm-body.\nIdaho felt that too much had happened to him too fast since the Tleilaxu had abandoned him to the mercies of Luli and Friend in that featureless prison-cell room.\nToo much...too much...\nAm I really here? he wondered. /s this me? What are these thoughts that | think?\nHe stared at Leto’s quiescent body, the shadowy and enormous mass which lay so silently there on its cart within the pit. The very quietness of that fleshly mass only suggested mysterious energies, terrible energies which might be unleashed in ways nobody could anticipate.\nIdaho had heard the stories about the fight at the Ixian Embassy, but the Fish Speaker accounts had an aura of miraculous visitation about them which obscured the physical data.\n“He flew down from above them and executed a terrible slaughter among the sinners.”\n“How did he do that?” Idaho had asked.\n“He was an angry God,” his informant had said.\nAngry, Idaho thought. Was it because of the threat to Hwi? The stories he had heard! None were believable. Hwi wedded to this gross... It was not possible! Not the lovely Hwi, the Hwi of gentle delicacy. He is playing some terrible game, testing us... testing us... There was no honest reality in these times, no peace except in the presence of Hwi. All else was insanity.\nAs he returned his attention to Leto’s face—that silently waiting Atreides face—the sense of dislocation grew stronger in Idaho. He began to wonder if, by a slight increase in mental effort along some strange new pathway, he might break through ghostly barriers to remember all of the experiences of the other Ghola Idahos.\nWhat did they think when they entered this room? Did they feel this dislocation, this rejection?\nJust a little extra effort.\nHe felt dizzy and wondered if he was going to faint.\n“Is something wrong, Duncan?” It was Leto’s most reasonable and calming tone.\n“It’s not real,” Idaho said. “I don’t belong here.”\nLeto chose to misunderstand. “But my guard tells me you came here of your own accord, that you flew back from the Citadel and demanded an immediate audience.”\n“I mean here, now! In this time!”\n“But | need you.”\n“For what?”\n“Look around you, Duncan. The ways you can help me are so numerous that you could not do them all.”\n“But your women won't let me fight! Every time | want to go where...”\n“Do you question that you’re more valuable alive than dead?” Leto made a clucking sound, then: “Use your wits, Duncan! That’s what | value.”\n“And my sperm. You value that.”\n“Your sperm is your own to put where you wish.”\n“I will not leave a widow and orphans behind me the way...”\n“Duncan! I’ve said the choice is yours.”\nIdaho swallowed, then: “You’ve committed a crime against us, Leto, against all of us—the gholas you resurrect without ever asking us if that’s what we want.”\nThis was a new turn in Duncan-thinking. Leto peered at Idaho with renewed interest.\n“What crime?”\n“Oh, I’ve heard you spouting your deep thoughts,” Idaho accused. He hooked a thumb over his shoulder, pointing at the room’s entrance. “Did you know you can be heard out there in the anteroom?”\n“When I wish to be heard, yes.” But only my journals hear it all! “| would like to know the nature of my crime, though.” “There’s a time, Leto, a time when you’re alive. A time when you’re supposed to be alive. It can have a magic, that time, while you’re living it. You know you’re never going to\nsee a time like that again.”\nLeto blinked, touched by the Duncan’s distress. The words were evocative.\nIdaho raised both hands, palms up, to chest-height, a beggar asking for something he knew he could not receive.\n“Then... one day you wake up and you remember dying... and you remember the axlotl tank... and the Tleilaxu nastiness which awakened you... and it’s Supposed to start all over again. But it doesn’t. It never does, Leto. That’s a crime!”\n“I have taken away the magic?”\n“Yes!”\nIdaho dropped his hands to his sides and clenched them into fists. He felt that he stood alone in the path of a millrace tide which would overwhelm him at his slightest relaxation.\nAnd what of my time? Leto thought. This, too, will never happen again. But the Duncan would not understand the difference.\n“What brought you rushing back from the Citadel?” Leto asked.\nIdaho took a deep breath, then: “Is it true? You’re to be married?”\n“That’s correct.”\n“To this Hwi Noree, the Ixian Ambassador?”\n“True.”\nIdaho darted a quick glance along Leto’s supine length.\nThey always look for genitalia, Leto thought. Perhaps | should have something made, a gross protuberance to shock them. He choked back the small burst of amusement which threatened to erupt from his throat. Another emotion amplified. Thank you, Hwi. Thank you, Ixians.\nIdaho shook his head. “But you.. .”\n“There are strong elements to a marriage other than sex,” Leto said. “Will we have children of our flesh? No. But the effects of this union will be profound.”\n“I listened while you were talking to Moneo,” Idaho said. “I thought it must be some kind of joke,a.. .”\n“Careful, Duncan!”\n“Do you Jove her?”\n“More deeply than any man ever loved a woman.”\n“Well, what about her? Does she...”\n“She feels ... a compelling compassion, a need to share with me, to give whatever she can give. It is her nature.”\nIdaho suppressed a feeling of revulsion.\n“Moneo’s right. They'll believe the Tleilaxu stories.”\n“That is one of the profound effects.”\n“And you still want me to... to mate with Siona!”\n“You know my wishes. | leave the choice to"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_d152eef0dc4acd0cba25f93c6af2cb087b1e66fa3163fcd13203fb47e040864c_v2"}
