She looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand.\n“You look a mess,” he said.\n“You're not so pretty yourself,” she said.\nThey started to laugh, then sobered.\n“That shouldn’t have happened,” Paul said. “I was careless.”\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.\n“I'll put up the tent,” he said. “Better slip off that robe and shake it out.” He turned away, taking the pack.\nJessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.\n“There’s anchor holes in the rock,” Paul said. “Someone's tented here before.”\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place—deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away—far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.\nShe turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere blending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the oil lenses on the other cliff, lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand.\nJessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons.\n“There are growing things over there,” he said.\nJessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul.\n“There,” he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other.\nShe looked where he pointed.\n“Saguaro,” she said. “Scrawny stuff.”\n“There may be people nearby,” Paul said.\n“That could be the remains of a botanical testing Station,” she warned.\n“This is pretty far south into the desert,” he said. He lowered his binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. “This has the feeling of a Fremen place,” he said.\n“Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?” she asked.\n“Kynes promised their help.”\nBut there’s desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. / felt some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.\nShe closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan—she and the Duke Leto, before Paul’s birth. They’d flown over the southern jungles, above the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery—man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder\npoles. And in the sea reaches there’d been the white petals of trimaran dhows.\nAll of it gone.\nJessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass.\nA spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sand-fall was gone, she still heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.\n“Worm,” Paul whispered.\nIt came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored. A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of vision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then it was gone, coursing off to the left.\nThe sound diminished, died.\n“I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,” Paul whispered.\nShe nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of Skyline.\n“When we've rested,” Jessica said, “we should continue with your lessons.”\nHe suppressed a sudden anger, said: “Mother, don’t you think we could do without....”\n“Today you panicked,” she said. “You know your mind and bindu-nervature perhaps better than I do, but you’ve much yet to learn about your body’s prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and | can teach you about this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body. You need review of the hands. We'll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and tip sensitivity.” She turned away. “Come, into the tent, now.”\nHe flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination...that he must agree.\nWhatever has been done to me, I’ve been a party to it, he thought.\nReview of the hand!\nHe looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.\nWe came from Caladan—a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind—we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life—we went soft, we lost our edge.\n—FROM “MUAD'DIB: CONVERSATIONS” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad S o you're the great Gurney Halleck,” the man Said.\nHalleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes that told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space frigate’s master control center—communications and viewscreens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk formed as a wall projection—part of the remaining curve.\n“I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek,” the Smuggler said.\n“Then you're the one | owe thanks for the help we've received,” Halleck said.\n“Ah-h-h, gratitude,” the smuggler said. “Sit down.”\nA ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler\nand scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.\nHalleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family resemblance in the smuggler now —the father’s heavy, overhanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose.\n“Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens,” Halleck said.\n“By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people,” Tuek said.\nAnger overcame part of Halleck’s fatigue. He straightened, said: “Can you name the traitor?”\n“We are not sure.”\n“Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.”\n“Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch...perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive.”\n“I heard.” Halleck took a deep breath. “It appears we've a deal more killing ahead of us.”\n“We will do nothing to attract attention to us,” Tuek said.\nHalleck stiffened. “But—”\n“You and those of your men we’ve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,” Tuek said. “You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can always use good men. We'll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the slightest open move against the Harkonnens.”\n“But they killed your father, man!”\n“Perhaps. And if so, l'Il give you my father’s answer to those who act without thinking: ‘A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool’s wrath Is heavier than them both.’”\n“You mean to do nothing about it, then?” Halleck sneered.\n“You did not hear me say that. | merely say | will protect our contract with the Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other ways of destroying a foe.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h.”\n“Ah, indeed. If you’ve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But | warn you that you’re probably too late...and we doubt she’s the one you want, anyway.”\n“Hawat made few mistakes.”\n“He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.”\n“You think he’s the traitor?”\nTuek shrugged. “This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the Harkonnens believe it.”\n“You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.”\n“Hints and suggestions...rumors and hunches.”\n“We are seventy-four men,” Halleck said. “If you seriously wish us to enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead.”\n“His body has been seen.”\n“And the boy, too—young Master Paul?” Halleck tried to swallow, found a lump in his throat.\n“According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found.”\n“So the witch is dead then...all dead.”\nTuek nodded. “And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune.”\n“The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?”\n“Yes.”\nIt took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him. He spoke with panting breath: “I’ve a score of my own against Rabban. | owe him for the lives of my family....” He rubbed at the scar along his jaw. “...and for this....”\n“One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely,” Tuek said. He frowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck’s jaw, the sudden withdrawal in the man’s shed-lidded eyes.\n“I know...| know.” Halleck took a deep breath.\n“You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us. There are many places to\n“I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With Rabban here—|I stay.”\n“In your mood, I’m not sure we want you to stay.”\nHalleck stared at the smuggler. “You doubt my word?”\n“NO-O-0....”\n“You’ve saved me from the Harkonnens. | gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no greater reason. III stay on Arrakis—with you...or with the Fremen.”\n“Whether a thought is spoken or not it Is a real thing and it has power,” Tuek said. “You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.”\nHalleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him. “Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?” he murmured.\n“Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,” Tuek said. “Speed is a device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart—water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.”\nHalleck opened his eyes. “I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”\n“I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow", " Arrakis—with you...or with the Fremen.”\n“Whether a thought is spoken or not it Is a real thing and it has power,” Tuek said. “You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.”\nHalleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him. “Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?” he murmured.\n“Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,” Tuek said. “Speed is a device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart—water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.”\nHalleck opened his eyes. “I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”\n“I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. | can only help you meet today.”\n“Then l'Il accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who—”\n“Listen to me, fighting man,” Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler’s face was suddenly like weathered stone. “My father’s water—l’ll buy that back myself, with my own blade.”\nHalleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the Smuggler reminded him of Duke Leto: a leader of men, Courageous, secure in his own position and his own course. He was like the Duke...before Arrakis.\n“Do you wish my blade beside you?” Halleck asked.\nTuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.\n“Do you think of me as fighting man?” Halleck pressed.\n“You're the only one of the Duke’s lieutenants to escape,” Tuek said. “Your enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him.... You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis.”\n“Ene.\n“We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,” Tuek said. “Arrakis is our enemy.”\n“One enemy ata time, is that it?”\n“That’s it.”\n“Is that the way the Fremen make out?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“You said | might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the desert, in the open, is that why?”\n“Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man’s land. But | wish to talk more about—”\n“I'm told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,” Halleck said. “But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look.”\n“Rumors!” Tuek sneered. “Do you wish to choose now between me and the Fremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock, our own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few ragged bands that we use as spice-hunters.”\n“But they can kill Harkonnens.”\n“And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down like animals—with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being exterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens.”\n“Was it Harkonnens they killed?” Halleck asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Haven’t you heard that there may’ve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?”\n“More rumors.”\n“But a pogrom—that isn’t like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful.”\n“I believe what | see with my own eyes,” Tuek said. “Make your choice, fighting man. Me or the Fremen. | will promise you sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted.”\nHalleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek’s words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain.\n“Trust your own abilities,” Tuek said. “Whose decisions brought your force through the battle? Yours. Decide.”\n“It must be,” Halleck said. “The Duke and his son are dead?”\n“The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, | incline to trust the Harkonnens.” A grim smile touched Tuek’s mouth. “But it’s about the only trust | give them.”\n“Then it must be,” Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. “I give you my sword.”\n“Accepted.”\n“Do you wish me to persuade my men?”\n“You'd let them make their own decision?”\n“They’ve followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn’t what they thought it’d be. Here, they’ve lost everything except their lives. I'd prefer they decided for themselves now.”\n“Now is no time for you to falter,” Tuek said. “They've followed you this far.”\n“You need them, is that it?”\n“We can always use experienced fighting men...in these times more than ever.”\n“You’ve accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?”\n“I think they'll follow you, Gurney Halleck.”\n“Tis to be hoped.”\n“Indeed.”\n“I may make my own decision in this, then?”\n“Your own decision.”\nHalleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required. “For now, l'Il see to their quarters and well-being,” he said.\n“Consult my quartermaster,” Tuek said. “Drisq is his name. Tell him it’s my wish that you receive every courtesy. l'Il join you myself presently. I’ve some off- Shipments of spice to see to first.”\n“Fortune passes everywhere,” Halleck said.\n“Everywhere,” Tuek said. “A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business.”\nHalleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the office.\nHe found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by Tuek’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air-\nconvection currents. Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls.\nHalleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing—no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.\nThe Atreides training— “We care for our own!’”—it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted. One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck’s nine-string baliset out of its case. The man\nSnapped a Salute, said: “Sir, the medics here say there’s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here—only outpost medicine. Mattal can’t last, they say, and he has a request of you.”\n“What is it?”\nThe lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. “Mattai wants a song to ease his going, sir. He says you'll know the one...he’s asked it of you often enough.” The lieutenant swallowed. “It’s the one called ‘My Woman,’ sir. If you—”\n“I know.” Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone had already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile Casually.\nSeveral of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters. One of the men began\nSinging softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:\n“My woman stands at her window, Curved lines ‘’gainst square glass. Uprais’d arms...bent...downfolded. ’Gainst sunset red and golded— Come to me...\nCome to me, warm arms of my lass. For me...\nFor me, the warm arms of my lass.”\nThe singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter.\nHalleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are seventy-three.\nFamily life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, | think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic- eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and | was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I’m not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new Slave-concubine, then, red- haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer’s muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: “She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift.” You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\naul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in the tent.\nFolds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their Shelter. Away from the setting sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night.\nAnd the flatness.\nHis mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no persuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that horizon—no bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze...only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a Sky of burnished silver-blue.\nWhat if there isn’t one of the abandoned testing stations across there? he wondered. What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?\nWithin the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul.

He stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away.\nPresently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the tent’s catchpocket, and Slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her muscles.\nPaul spoke without turning: “I find myself enjoying the quiet here.”\nHow the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: “The mind can go either direction under stress— toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.”\n“It could be a good life here,” Paul said.\nShe tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the rigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering at the possible futures Paul had glimpsed. One could be alone out here, she thought, without fear of someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.\nShe stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and studied the escarpment across from them. Yes, Saguaro in the arroyos and other spiny growth...and a matting of low grasses, yellow-green in the shadows.\n“I'll strike camp,” Paul said.\nJessica nodded, walked to the fissure’s mouth where she could get a sweep of the desert, and swung her binoculars to the left. A salt pan glared white there with a blending of dirty tan at its edges— a field of white out here where white was death. But the pan said another thing: water. At some time water had flowed across that glaring white. She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose, listened for a moment to the sound of Paul’s movements.\nThe sun dipped lower. Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild color spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed into a toe of darkness testing the sand. Coal-colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night blotted the desert.\nStars!\nShe stared up at them, sensing Paul’s movements as he came up beside her. The desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars. The weight of the day receded. There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.\n“The first moon will be up soon,” Paul said. “The pack’s ready. I’ve planted the thumper.”\nWe could be lost forever in this hellplace, she thought. And no one to know.\nThe night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark.\n“Smell that,” Paul said.\n“I can smell it even through the filter,” she said. “Riches. But will it buy water?” She pointed across the basin. “There are no artificial lights across there.”\n“Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks,” he said.\nA sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon. It lifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its face. Jessica studied the white- silver of sand exposed in the light.\n“| planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse,” Paul said. “Whenever | light its candle it’ll give us about thirty minutes.”\n“Thirty minutes?”\n“Before it starts calling...a...worm.”\n“Oh. I’m ready to go.”\nHe slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their fissure.\nThe night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow...if we’re to have a tomorrow. She shook her head. Why must I be so morbid? | was trained better than that!\nPaul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first soreading dune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him. He heard her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sound—the desert’s own code spelling out its measure of safety.\n“We must walk without rhythm,” Paul said and he called up memory of men walking the sand...both prescient memory and real memory.\n“Watch how | do it,” he said. “This is how Fremen walk the sand.”\nHe stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of it, moved with a dragging pace.\nJessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She saw the sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of sand...like the wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step...drag...drag...step...step...wait...drag...step....\nTime stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer. The one behind still towered high.\n“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”\nIt was a drumming from the cliff behind.\n“The thumper,” Paul hissed.\nIts pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride.\n“Lump...lump...lump...lump....”\nThey moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping. Down and up through spilling dunes: step...drag...wait...step.... Across pea sand that rolled under their feet: drag...wait...step....\nAnd all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.\nThe sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage masked it. But it grew...louder and louder...out of the west.\n“Lump...lump...lump...lump....” drummed the thumper.\nThe hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned their heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.\n“Keep moving,” Paul whispered. “Don’t look back.”\nA grating sound of fury exploded from the rock Shadows they had left. It was a flailing avalanche of noise.\n“Keep moving,” Paul repeating.\nHe saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces—the one ahead and the one behind—appeared equally remote.\nAnd still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night.\nThey moved on and on and on.... Muscles reached a stage of mechanical aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the beckoning escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.\nJessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her will alone kept her walking. Dryness ached in her mouth, but the sounds behind drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuit’s catchpockets.\n“Lump...lump....”\nRenewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper.\nSilence!\n“Faster,” Paul whispered.\nShe nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limits—the unnatural movement....\nThe rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base. He stepped onto it, stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary outthrusting of a foot.\nResonant booming shook the sand around them.\nPaul lurched sideways two steps.\n“Boom! Boom!”\n“Drum sand!” Jessica hissed.\nPaul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around them, the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.\nBehind them, he heard a hissing—like the wind, like a riptide where there was no water.\n“Run!” Jessica screamed. “Paul, run!”\nThey ran.\nDrum sound boomed beneath their feet. Then they were out of it and into pea gravel. For a time, the running was a relief to muscles that ached from unfamiliar, rhnythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here was rhythm. But sand and gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them.\nJessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror.\nPaul dragged her up.\nThey ran on, hand in hand.\nA thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another.\nJessica’s mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.\nThere was another—wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.\nAnother.\nRock!\nShe felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new strength from the firmer footing.\nA deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff anead of them. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole.\nBehind them, the sound of the worm’s passage stopped.\nJessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.\nWhere the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock beach, a silver-gray curve\nbroached from the desert, sending rivers of sand and dust cascading all around. It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing mouth. It was a round, black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.\nThe mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled. Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.\nBack and forth the great mouth wove.\nPaul stilled his breathing.\nJessica crouched staring.\nIt took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the primal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that threatened to fill her mind.\nPaul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a time barrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing revealed to his inner eye. It was as though some step he had taken had plunged him into a well...or into the trough of a wave where the future was invisible. The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.\nInstead of frightening him, the sensation of time- darkness forced a hyper-acceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter...crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim...the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle aldehydes...Acids....\nThe worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A shower of small stones and Sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.\nPaul crowded his mother farther back.\nCinnamon!\nThe smell of it flooded across him.\nWhat has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice.\n“Barrrroooom!”\nIt was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.\nAgain: “Barrrroooom!”\nThe worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes.\n“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”\nAnother thumper! Paul thought.\nAgain it sounded off to their right.\nA shudder passed through the worm."], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_2b4c22d8005c7e03b714cc9f70b78b4e7d53c07f5f77cb64ed376b8b66dc4653_v2"}
