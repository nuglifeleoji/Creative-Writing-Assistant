Was that truly their intent? The damnable woman! He could not be sure of anything she said.\nWhen she returned him to his quarters in the ship, Scytale stood for a long time looking through the barrier field at the long corridor where Idaho and Murbella sometimes came on their way to their practice floor. He knew that must be where they went through a wide doorway down there. They always emerged sweating and breathing deeply.\nNeither of his fellow prisoners appeared, although he loitered there for more than an hour.\nShe uses the ghola as a Mentat! That must mean he has access to a Shipsystems console. Surely, she would not deprive her Mentat of his data. Somehow, | must contrive it that Idaho and | meet intimately. There’s always the whistling language we impress on every ghola. | must not appear too anxious. A small concession in the bargaining, perhaps. A complaint that my quarters are confining. They see how I chafe at imprisonment.\nEducation is no substitute for intelligence. That elusive quality is defined only in part by puzzle-solving ability. It is in the creation of new puzzles reflecting what your senses report that you round out the definition.\n—MENTAT TEXT ONE (DECTO)\nhey wheeled Lucilla into Great Honored Matre’s presence in a tubular cage—a cage within a cage. Shigawire netting confined her to the center of the thing.\n“lam Great Honored Matre,” the woman in the heavy black chair greeted her. Small woman, red-gold leotards. “The cage is for your protection should you try to use Voice. We are immune. Our immunity takes the form of a reflex. We kill. A number of you have died that way. We know Voice and use it. Remember it when | release you from your cage.” She waved away the servants who had brought the cage. “Go! Go!”\nLucilla looked around the room. Windowless. Almost square. Lighted by a few silvery glowglobes. Acid-green walls. Typical interrogation setting. It was somewhere high. They had brought her cage in a nulltube shortly before dawn.\nA panel behind Great Honored Matre snapped aside and a smaller cage came sliding into the room on a hidden mechanism. This cage was square and in it stood what she thought at first was a naked man until he turned and looked at her.\nFutar! It had a wide face and she saw the canines.\n“Want back rub,” the Futar said.\n“Yes, darling. l'Il rub your back later.”\n“Want eat,” the Futar said. It glared at Lucilla.\n“Later, darling.”\nThe Futar continued to study Lucilla. “You Handler?” it asked.\n“Of course she’s not a Handler!”\n“Want eat,” the Futar insisted.\n“Later, | said! For now, you just sit there and purr for me.”\nThe Futar squatted in its cage and a rumbling sound issued from its throat.\n“Aren't they sweet when they purr?” Great Honored Matre obviously did not expect an answer.\nThe presence of the Futar puzzled Lucilla. Those things were supposed to hunt and kill Honored Matres. It was caged, though.\n“Where did you capture it?” Lucilla asked.\n“On Gammu.” She did not see what she had revealed.\nAnd this ts Junction, Lucilla thought. She had recognized it from the lighter the evening before.\nThe Futar stopped purring. “Eat,” it grumbled.\nLucilla would have liked something to eat. They had not fed her in three days and she was forced to suppress hunger pangs. Small sips of water from a literjon left in the cage helped but that was almost empty. The servants who had brought her had laughed at her request for food. “Futars like lean meat!”\nIt was the absence of melange that plagued her most. She had begun to feel the first withdrawal pains that morning.\n| shall have to kill myself soon.\nThe Lampadas horde pleaded for her to endure. Be brave. What if that wild Reverend Mother fails us?\nSpider Queen. That is what Odrade calls this woman.\nGreat Honored Matre continued to study her, hand to chin. It was a weak chin. In a face without positive features, the negative attracted the gaze.\n“You will lose in the end, you know,” Great Honored Matre said.\n“Whistling past the graveyard,” Lucilla said and then had to explain the expression.\nThere was a polite show of interest on Great Honored Matre’s face. How interesting.\n“Any of my aides would have killed you immediately for saying that. This is one of the reasons we are alone. | am curious why you would say such a thing?”\nLucila glanced at the squatting Futar. “Futars did not occur overnight. They were genetically created from wild animal stock for one purpose.”\n“Careful!” Orange flamed in Great Honored Matre’s eyes.\n“Generations of development went into the creation of the Futars,” Lucilla said.\n“We hunt them for our pleasure!”\n“And the hunter becomes the hunted.”\nGreat Honored Matre leaped to her feet, eyes completely orange. The Futar became agitated and began whining. This calmed the woman. Slowly, she sank back into her chair. One hand gestured at the caged Futar. “It’s all right, darling. You'll eat soon and then l'Il rub your back.”\nThe Futar resumed its purring.\n“So you think we came back here as refugees,” Great Honored Matre said. “Yes! Don’t try to deny it.”\n“Worms often turn,” Lucilla said.\n“Worms? You mean like those monstrosities we destroyed on Rakis?”\nIt was tempting to prod this Honored Matre and evoke the dramatic response. Alarm her enough and she would certainly kill.\nPlease, Sister! the Lampadas horde begged. Endure.\nYou think | can escape from this place? That silenced them, except for one faint protest. Remember! We are the ancient doll: seven times down, eight times up. It came with a rocking image of a small red doll, grinning Buddha face and hands clasped over its fat belly.\n“You're obviously referring to the revenants of the God Emperor,” Lucilla said. “I had something else in mind.”\nGreat Honored Matre took her time considering this. The orange faded from her eyes.\nShe’s playing with me, Lucilla thought. She intends to kill me and feed me to her pet.\nBut think of the tactical information you could provide if we did escape!\nWe! But there was no avoiding the accuracy of that protest. They had brought her cage from the lighter while it was still daylight. Approaches to the Spider Queen’s lair were well planned for difficult access but the planning amused Lucilla. Very ancient, out-of-date planning. Narrow places in the approach lanes with observation turrets projecting from the ground like dull gray mushrooms appearing at the proper places on their mycelium. Sharp turns at critical points. No ordinary ground vehicle could negotiate such turns at speed.\nThere was mention of this in Teg’s critique of Junction, she recalled. Nonsense defenses. One had only to bring in heavy equipment or go over such crude installations another way and the things were isolated. Linked underground, naturally, but that could be disrupted by explosives. Ligate them, cut them off from their source, and they would fall piecemeal. No more precious energy coming down your tube, idiots! Visible sense of security and Honored Matres kept it. For reassurance! Their defenders must spend a great deal of energy on useless displays to give these women a false sense of security.\nThe hallways! Remember the hallways.\nYes, the hallways in this gigantic building were enormous, the better to accommodate giant tanks in which Guild Navigators were forced to live groundside. Ventilation systems low along the halls to take out and reclaim spilled melange gas. She could imagine hatches thumping open and closed with disturbing reverberations. Guildsmen never\nseemed to mind loud noises. Energy transmission lines for mobile suspensors were thick black snakes winding across passages and into every room she had glimpsed. Wouldn’t do to keep a Navigator from snooping any place he desired.\nMany of the people she had seen wore guide pulsers. Even Honored Matres. So they got lost here. Everything under the one giant mound of a roof with its phallic towers. The new residents found this attractive. Heavily insulated from the crude outdoors (where none of the important people go anyway except to kill things or watch the slaves at their amusing work and play). Through much of it, she had seen a shabbiness that said minimal expenditure on maintenance. They are not changing much. Teg’s ground plan is still accurate.\nSee how valuable your observations could be?\nGreat Honored Matre stirred from her reverie. “It is just possible that | could permit you to live. Provided you satisfy some of my curiosity.”\n“How do you know | won’t respond to your curiosity with a flow of pure shit?”\nVulgarity amused Great Honored Matre. She almost laughed. Apparently no one had ever warned her to beware of the Bene Gesserit when they resorted to vulgarity. The motivation for it was sure to be something distressing. No Voice, eh? She thinks that’s my only resource? Great Honored Matre had said enough and reacted enough to give any Reverend Mother a sure handle on her. Body and speech signals always carried more information than was necessary for comprehension. There was inevitable extra information to be sampled.\n“Do you find us attractive?” Great Honored Matre asked.\nOdd question. “People from the Scattering all possess a certain attraction.” Let her think I’ve seen many of them, including her enemies. “You're exotic, meaning strange and new.”\n“And our sexual prowess?”\n“There’s an aura to that, naturally. Exciting and magnetic to some.”\n“But not to you.”\nGo for the chin! Iit was a suggestion from the horde. Why not?\n“I’ve been studying your chin, Great Honored Matre.”\n“You have?” Surprised.\n“It’s obviously your childhood chin and you should be proud of that youthful remembrance.”\nNot pleased at all but unable to show it. Hit the chin again.\n“I'll bet your lovers often kiss your chin,” Lucilla said.\nAngry now and still unable to vent it. Threaten me, will you! Warn me not to use Voice!\n“Kiss chin,” the Futar said.\n“ĮI said later, darling. Now will you shut up!”\nTaking it out on her poor pet.\n“But you have questions you want to ask me,” Lucilla said. Sweetness itself. Another warning signal to the knowledgeable. /’m one of those who pours sugar syrup over everything. “How nice! Such a pleasant time when we’re with you. Isn’t that beautiful! Weren’t you clever to get it so cheaply! Easily. Quickly.” Supply your own adverb.\nGreat Honored Matre was a moment composing herself. She sensed that she had been placed at a disadvantage but could not say how. She covered the moment with an enigmatic smile, then: “But | said | would release you.” She pressed something on the side of her chair and a section of the tubular cage swung aside, taking the shigawire netting with it. In the same instant, a low chair lifted from a panel in the floor directly in front of her and not a pace away.\nLucilla seated herself in the chair, knees almost touching her inquisitor. Feet. Remember they kill with their feet.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and feared group of women known for their sexual prowess and violent tendencies, often in conflict with the Bene Gesserit\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SCYTALE<|>PERSON<|>A Tleilaxu Master and prisoner who is observing Idaho and Murbella, plotting to meet Idaho\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A ghola of Duncan Idaho, used as a Mentat by the Honored Matres\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>A Honored Matre who is training with Idaho\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILA<|>PERSON<|>A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother captured by the Honored Matres, enduring interrogation and deprivation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>PERSON<|>The leader of the Honored Matres, interrogating Lucilla with a mix of curiosity and threat\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FUTAR<|>PERSON<|>A genetically engineered creature, originally designed to hunt Honored Matres, now caged and controlled by them\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet where the Futar was captured by the Honored Matres\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JUNCTION<|>GEO<|>The location of the Honored Matres' stronghold, a heavily defended and labyrinthine complex\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>A planet where the Honored Matres destroyed the sandworms, a significant event in their history\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LAMPADAS HORDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Bene Gesserit group urging Lucilla to endure and gather tactical information\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, often in conflict with the Honored Matres\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>A military strategist whose critiques of Junction's defenses are recalled by Lucilla\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD NAVIGATORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of mutated humans who navigate space, now subjugated by the Honored Matres\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SCYTALE<|>IDAHO<|>Scytale plots to meet Idaho, possibly using a shared whistling language<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>MURBELLA<|>Idaho and Murbella train together, suggesting a close working relationship<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>Lucilla is interrogated by the Great Honored Matre, a tense and adversarial relationship<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>FUTAR<|>The Great Honored Matre keeps the Futar as a pet, despite its original purpose to hunt Honored Matres<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>FUTAR<|>Lucilla observes the Futar and deduces its origins, linking it to the Honored Matres' vulnerabilities<|>4\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit are in conflict, with the former hunting the latter<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>GAMMU<|>The Great Honored Matre reveals the Futar was captured on Gammu, hinting at their territorial reach<|>3\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>JUNCTION<|>Lucilla recognizes Junction as the Honored Matres' stronghold and recalls its defenses<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>RAKIS<|>The Great Honored Matre mentions destroying the sandworms on Rakis, a key event in their rise<|>4\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCILA<|>LAMPADAS HORDE<|>The Lampadas horde urges Lucilla to endure and gather intelligence for the Bene Gesserit<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>JUNCTION<|>Teg's critiques of Junction's defenses are recalled by Lucilla, highlighting their strategic importance<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GUILD NAVIGATORS<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Guild Navigators are subjugated by the Honored Matres, forced to live in their complex<|>6\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
