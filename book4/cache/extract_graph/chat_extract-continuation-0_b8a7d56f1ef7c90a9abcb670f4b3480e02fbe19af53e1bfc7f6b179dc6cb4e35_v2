。孙少安夫妇正忙得不可开交。第三窑砖正烧到紧要关头，少安既要加炭漏灰，还要刁空抢着打下一窑的土坯，还不到热天，他就光穿了件小布褂，脸熏得如同戏里的包公，秀莲头上拢着的毛巾也象烟囱里拉出来的——她正拿着铁锨和泥。 \n　　少平和父亲一到，四个人上手，活路很快就松宽了。父亲接替少安烧火，让他集中打土坯；少平和泥，让嫂子去溜土。这是一个多么和谐而富有生气的劳动集体！瞧，已出的两窑青砖，约摸一万多块，齐齐整整码在土场边上，象两堵蓝色的长墙。双水村的人面对孙家的这派兴旺景象，谁不眼红？啊呀，不得了！孙少安这小子竟然办起了“工厂”！ \n　　天黑以后，少安让家里人回去吃饭。他自己的饭照例由秀莲吃完饭后送到土场上来——他要照看炉火，不能离开。等父亲嫂子先后走了以后，少平却磨蹭着没有急忙回家。他一边在和哥哥添炭，一边吞吞吐吐对哥哥说出了他的心事。 \n　　少安惊讶得都有点反应不过来了。他生气地对弟弟说：“你胡想啥哩！家里现在这么忙，人手缺得要命，你怎么能跑到外面逛去呢？” \n　　这个“逛”字刺伤了少平的心。他也有点生硬地对哥哥说：“我不是去逛！我是要出去干点事！” \n　　“干什么事？无非是去揽工！你又不是匠人，当个小工，一天挣一两块钱，连自己的嘴都糊不住！你何必要之受这罪呢？你在家里，咱们父子三人，加上你嫂，一边种地，一边经营咱们的烧砖窑，这不好好的嘛！” \n　　“我已经二十几的人了，我自己也可以干点什么事！” \n　　少安一时不能理解弟弟是什么意思，难道你现在没事可干吗？ \n　　但少安猛然感到，弟弟已经长大成人了！他已经不能再象过去一样在他面前以老大自居了！是啊，弟弟大了……本来他应该为此而高兴，可是此刻心里却有一丝说不出的伤感。 \n　　他早已看出来，弟弟是一个和他想法不太一样的人……现在，少安已经明白，尽管他不情愿弟弟出走，但看来已经很难劝阻他了。 \n　　兄弟俩圪蹴在土场边上沉默了一会，一人嘴里噙着根旱烟棒，使劲地抽着。天已经黑严，远处村子里亮起了模糊的灯光。在金家湾那边，不知谁家婆姨正拖长声音呼叫孩子回家睡觉。东拉河水声朗朗，吟唱着那支永不疲倦的歌……孙少安已不再和弟弟争辨。他伤感地对少平说：“那你看着办吧，你已经长大成人了，我……”他感\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
