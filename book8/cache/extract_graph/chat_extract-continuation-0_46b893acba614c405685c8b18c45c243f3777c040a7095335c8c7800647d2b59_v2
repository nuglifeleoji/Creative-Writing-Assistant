当初他在离开的时候还曾经保证过一定会回来陪伴儿子度过假期，带他们母子二人好好出去玩玩。可是，已经一个半月了，魂导通讯都再没来过。\n\n    因为是星际探索，所以南澄只能等待他的被动联系。\n\n    患得患失的心态，让她开始有些后悔起来，后悔当初不该让蓝潇去了。等他回来，类似的任务一定不会让他再去。\n\n    自从认识他，他们还从未像现在这样分别这么长的时间。她真的很想他了。\n\n    蓝轩宇自然也想爸爸，不时会问南澄，爸爸什么时候回来呀。每当这个时候，南澄的心情就会更加揪紧几分。蓝潇不会出事了吧？\n\n    天罗星，天罗学院附属紫萝分院，一年级第二学期最后一天。\n\n    蓝轩宇早早的就来到了学校，一年级第二学期，他的成绩更好了。相比于上学期，这一学期，他几乎是全方位的都得到了班里的第一名。\n\n    自从那次实战课一战成名之后，在年级里，他的实战能力就已是名列前茅。而那段时间之后，叶灵瞳突然转学了。不知道是什么原因。这就让他在一年级更没有对手了。\n\n    老师简单的布置了假期作业，无非就是文化课的复习和预习，再加上修炼的任务。\n\n    蓝轩宇最近感觉到，自己似乎距离第十四级魂力已经不远了。相比于跟随娜娜学习之前，总算修炼的速度要快了一些。按照这个速度的话，用不了十岁，他应该也能达到二十级魂力的程度。这在同龄人之中，还算是不慢的。\n\n    十二岁之前达到二十级，都是非常优秀的表现。\n\n    秋雨馨对自己这个得意门生也是很满意的。这孩子几乎可以用完美来形容，对于一个老师来说，根本没可能不喜欢这样的学生。\n\n    乖巧听话，学习成绩优秀，实战出色，变异武魂。最重要的是，长得漂亮啊！\n\n    那粉妆玉琢的小模样，连她有的时候都忍不住想要捏一把，当然，为人师表，她肯定不能这么干的！她就想，要是自己有这么个儿子该多好啊！或者有个女儿也行，就想办法把他招成女婿。\n\n    看着蓝轩宇，秋雨馨顿时觉得自己好像有些想多了。\n\n    “轩宇，你留一下，老师有话对你说。”秋雨馨向蓝轩宇招了招手。\n\n    “好的，秋老师。”蓝轩宇本来刚收拾好书包准备离开，被秋雨馨叫住赶忙留了下来。\n\n    “轩宇，有个事儿老师要告诉你一下。这次假期你也可以好好做准备。”秋雨馨低声说道。\n\n    “什么事啊？”蓝轩宇好奇的问道。\n------------\n\n第五十九章 高能少年�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
