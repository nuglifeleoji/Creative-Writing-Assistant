It emerged as a universal truce, enforced by key powers such as the Spacing Guild, the Great Houses, and the Imperium, to prevent mutual destruction and maintain stability across the Old Empire.  \n\nCentral to the Convention was the outright ban on the use of atomic weapons against human targets, as well as restrictions on shields and other technologies that could escalate warfare. Additionally, it served as a deterrent against sneak attacks, ensuring that conflicts between Great Houses remained limited and did not spiral into total war. The Landsraad, the assembly of noble houses, was bound by this treaty, which helped curb open hostilities and maintain a fragile balance of power.  \n\nThe Convention was referenced in discussions by figures such as Nayla, Leto, and Idaho, underscoring its historical significance. However, its influence waned over time, and it was eventually declared ended by Odrade, marking a shift in the political landscape. Despite its dissolution, the Great Convention remains a pivotal example of interstellar diplomacy, representing an era when factions sought to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of unchecked warfare through mutual agreement.  \n\nIn summary, the Great Convention was a foundational treaty that:  \n- Prohibited atomics, shields, and surprise attacks.  \n- Bound the Landsraad and Great Houses to prevent total war.  \n- Relied on enforcement by the Guild and Imperium.  \n- Was ultimately dissolved, signaling the end of an era.  \n\nIts legacy endures as a testament to the challenges of maintaining peace in a fractious interstellar society.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251769, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 336, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 620, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 220}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
