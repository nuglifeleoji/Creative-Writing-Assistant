“Yes.”\n“What am | supposed to do about him?”\nShe shrugged, feeling soiled and guilty because of her own actions.\n“What about his mother?” Idaho asked.\n“She and the others live up that street.” Siona nodded in the direction the boy had gone.\n“Others?”\n“There is an older son ...a daughter. Will you... 1 mean, | could arrange...”\n“No! The boy was right. I’m not his father.”\n“I’m sorry,” Siona whispered. “I should not have done this.”\n“Why did he choose this place?” Idaho asked.\n“The father... your...”\n“My predecessor!”\n“Because this was Irti’s home and she would not leave. That is what people said.”\n“Irti... the mother?”\n“Wife, by the old rite, the one from the Oral History.”\nIdaho looked around at the stone fronts of the buildings which enclosed the square, the curtained windows, the narrow doors. “So he lived here?”\n“When he could.”\n“How did he die, Siona?”\n“Truly, | do not know... but the Worm has killed others. We know that for sure!”\n“How do you know it?” He centered a probing stare on her face. The intensity of it forced her to look away.\n“I do not doubt the stories of my ancestors,” she said. “They are told in bits and pieces, a note here, a whispered account there, but | believe them. My father believes them, too!”\n“Moneo has said nothing to me of this.”\n“One thing you can say about the Atreides,” she said. “We're loyal and that’s a fact. We keep our word.”\nIdaho opened his mouth to speak, closed it without making a sound. Of course! Siona, too, was Atreides. The thought shook him. He had known it, but he had not accepted it. Siona was some kind of a rebel, a rebel whose actions were almost sanctioned by Leto. The limits of his permission were unclear, but Idaho sensed them.\n“You must not harm her,” Leto had said. “She is to be tested.”\nIdaho turned his back on Siona.\n“You don’t know anything for sure,” he said. “Bits and pieces, rumors!”\nSiona did not respond.\n“He’s an Atreides!” Idaho said.\n“He’s the Worm!” Siona said and the venom in her voice was almost palpable.\n“Your damned Oral History is nothing but a bunch of ancient gossip!” Idaho accused. “Only a fool would believe it.”\n“You still trust him,” she said. “That will change.”\nIdaho whirled and glared at her.\n“You’ve never talked to him!”\n“I have. When | was a child.”\n“You're still a child. He’s all of the Atreides who were, all of them. It’s a terrible thing, but | knew those people. They were my friends.”\nSiona only shook her head.\nAgain, Idaho turned away. He felt that he had been wrung dry of emotion. He was spiritually boneless. Without willing it, he began walking across the square and up the street where the boy had gone. Siona came running after him and fell into step, but he ignored her.\nThe street was narrow, enclosed by the one-story stone walls, the doors set back within arched frames, all of the doors closed. The windows were small versions of the doors. Curtains twitched as he passed.\nAt the first cross-street, Idaho stopped and looked to the right where the boy had gone. Two gray-haired women in long black skirts and dark green blouses stood a few paces away down the street, gossiping with their heads close together. They fell silent when they saw Idaho and stared at him with open curiosity. He returned their stare, then looked down the side-street. It was empty.\nIdaho turned toward the women, passed them within a pace. They drew closer together and turned to watch him. They looked only once at Siona, then returned their attention to Idaho. Siona moved quietly beside him, an odd expression on her face.\nSadness? he wondered. Regret? Curiosity?\nIt was difficult to say. He was more curious about the doorways and windows they were passing.\n“Have you ever been to Goygoa before?” Idaho asked.\n“No.” Siona spoke in a subdued voice, as though afraid of it.\nWhy am I walking down this street? Idaho wondered. Even as he asked himself the question, he knew the answer. This\nwoman, this Irti: What kind of a woman would bring me to Goygoa?\nThe corner of a curtain on his right lifted and Idaho saw a face—the boy from the square. The curtain dropped then was flung aside to reveal a woman standing there. Idaho stared speechlessly at her face, stopped in a completed step. It was the face of a woman known only to his deepest fantasies—a soft oval with penetrating dark eyes, a full and sensuous mouth...\n“Jessica,” he whispered.\n“What did you say?” Siona asked.\nIdaho could not answer. It was the face of Jessica resurrected out of a past he had believed gone forever, a genetic prank—Muad’Dib’s mother recreated in new flesh.\nThe woman closed the curtain, leaving the memory of her features in Idaho’s mind, an after-image which he knew he could never remove. She had been older than the Jessica who had shared their dangers on Dune—age-lines beside the mouth and eyes, the body a bit more full...\nMore motherly, \\daho told himself. Then: Did I ever tell her... who she resembled?\nSiona tugged at his sleeve. “Do you wish to go in, to meet her?”\n“No. This was a mistake.”\nIdaho started to turn back the way they had come, but the door of Irti’s house was flung open. A young man emerged and closed the door behind him, turning then to confront Idaho.\nIdaho guessed the youth’s age at sixteen and there was no denying the parentage—that karaku/ hair, the strong features.\n“You are the new one,” the youth said. His voice had already deepened into manhood.\n“Yes.” Idaho found if difficult to speak.\n“Why have you come?” the youth asked.\n“It was not my idea,” Idaho said. He found this easier to say, the words driven by resentment against Siona.\nThe youth looked at Siona. “We have had word that my father is dead.”\nSiona nodded.\nThe youth returned his attention to Idaho. “Please go away and do not return. You cause pain for my mother.”\n“Of course,” Idaho said. “Please apologize to the Lady Irti for this intrusion. | was brought here against my will.”\n“Who brought you?”\n“The Fish Speakers,” Idaho said.\nThe youth nodded once, a curt movement of the head. He looked once more at Siona. “I always thought that you Fish Speakers were taught to treat your own more kindly.” With that, he turned and reentered the house, closing the door firmly behind him.\nIdaho turned back the way they had come, grabbing Siona’s arm as he strode away. She stumbled, then fell into step, disengaging his grasp.\n“He thought | was a Fish Speaker,” she said.\n“Of course. You have the look.” He glanced at her. “Why didn’t you tell me that Irti was a Fish Speaker?”\n“It didn’t seem important.”\n“Oh.”\n“That’s how they met.”\nThey came to the intersection with the street from the square. Idaho turned away from the square, striding briskly up to the end where the village merged into gardens and orchards. He felt insulated by shock, his awareness recoiling from too much that could not be assimilated.\nA low wall blocked his path. He climbed over it, heard Siona follow. Trees around them were in bloom, white flowers with orange centers where dark brown insects worked. The air was full of insect buzzing and a floral scent which reminded Idaho of jungle flowers from Caladan.\nHe stopped when he reached the crest of a hill where he could turn and look back down at Goygoa’s rectangular neatness. The roofs were flat and black.\nSiona sat down on the thick grass of the hilltop and embraced her knees.\n“That was not what you intended, was it?” Idaho asked.\nShe shook her head and he saw that she was close to tears.\n“Why do you hate him so much?” he asked.\n“We have no lives of our own!”\nIdaho looked down at the village. “Are there many villages like this one?”\n“This is the shape of the Worm’s Empire!”\n“What’s wrong with it?”\n“Nothing—if that’s all you want.”\n“You're saying that this is all he allows?”\n“This, a few market cities . .. Onn. I’m told that even planetary capitals are just big villages.”\n“And | repeat: What’s wrong with that?”\n“It’s a prison!”\n“Then leave it.”\n“Where? How? You think we can just get on a Guild ship and go anywhere else, anywhere we want?” She pointed down toward Goygoa where the 'thopter could be seen off to one side, the Fish Speakers seated on the grass nearby. “Our jailers won’t let us leave!”\n“They leave,” Idaho said. “They go anywhere they want.”\n“Anywhere the Worm sends them!”\nShe pressed her face against her knees and spoke, her voice muffled. “What was it like in the old days?”\n“It was different, often very dangerous.” He looked around at the walls which set off pastureland, gardens and orchards. “Here on Dune, there were no imaginary lines to Show the limits of ownership on the land. It was all the Dukedom of the Atreides.”\n“Except for the Fremen.”\n“Yes. But they knew where they belonged—on this side of a particular escarpment... or beyond where the pan turns white against the sand.”\n“They could go wherever they wanted!”\n“With some limits.”\n“Some of us long for the desert,” she said.\n“You have the Sareer.”\nShe lifted her head to glare at him. “That little thing!”\n“Fifteen hundred kilometers by five hundred—not so little.”\nSiona got to her feet. “Have you asked the Worm why he confines us this way?”\n“Leto’s Peace, the Golden Path to insure our survival. That’s what he says.”\n“Do you know what he told my father? | spied on them when I was a child. | heard him.”\n“What did he say?”\n“He said he denies us most crises, to limit our forming forces. He said: ‘People can be sustained by affliction, but | am the affliction now. Gods can become afflictions.’ Those were his words, Duncan. The Worm is a sickness!”\nIdaho did not doubt the accuracy of her recital, but the words failed to stir him. He thought instead of the Corrino he had been ordered to kill. Affliction. The Corrino, descendant of a Family which once had ruled this Empire, had been revealed as a softly fat middle-aged man who hungered after power and conspired for spice. Idaho had ordered a Fish Speaker to kill him, an act which had aroused Moneo to a fit of intense questioning.\n“Why didn’t you kill him yourself?”\n“| wanted to see how the Fish Speakers performed.”\n“And your judgment of their performance?”\n“Efficient.”\nBut the death of the Corrino had inflicted Idaho with a sense of unreality. A fat little man lying in a pool of his own blood, an undistinguished shadow among the night shadows\nof a plastone street. It was unreal. Idaho could remember Muad’Dib saying: “The mind", " sickness!”\nIdaho did not doubt the accuracy of her recital, but the words failed to stir him.

Idaho could remember Muad’Dib saying: “The mind imposes this framework which it calls ‘reality.’ That arbitrary framework has a tendency to be quite independent of what your senses report.” What reality moved the Lord Leto?\nIdaho looked at Siona standing against the orchard background and the green hills of Goygoa. “Let’s go down to the village and find our quarters. I’d like to be alone.”\n“The Fish Speakers will put us in the same quarters.”\n“With them?”\n“No, just the two of us together. The reason’s simple enough. The Worm wants me to breed with the great Duncan Idaho.”\n“I pick my own partners,” Idaho growled.\n“I’m sure one of our Fish Speakers would be delighted,” Siona said. She whirled away from him and set off down the hill.\nIdaho watched her for a moment, the lithe young body swaying like the limbs of the orchard trees in the wind.\n“I’m not his stud,” Idaho muttered. “That’s one thing he'll have to understand.”\nAs each day passes, you become increasingly unreal, more alien and remote from what | find myself to be on that new day. | am the only reality and, as you differ from me, you lose reality. The more curious | become, the less curious are those who worship me. Religion suppresses curiosity. What | do subtracts from the worshipper. Thus it is that eventually | will do nothing, giving it all back to frightened people who will find themselves on that day alone and forced to act for themselves.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nt was a sound like no other, the sound of a waiting mob,\nand it came down the long tunnel to where Idaho marched ahead of the Royal Cart—nervous whispers magnified into an ultimate whisper, the shuffling of one gigantic foot, the stirring of an enormous garment. And the smell—sweet perspiration mixed with the milky breath of sexual excitement.\nInmeir and the others of his Fish Speaker escort had brought Idaho here in the first hour after dawn, coming down to the plaza of Onn while it lay in cold green shadows. They had lifted off immediately after turning him over to other Fish Speakers, Inmeir obviously unhappy because she was required to take Siona to the Citadel and thus would miss the ritual of Siaynoq.\nThe new escort, vibrant with repressed emotion, had taken him into a region deep beneath the plaza, a place not on any of the city charts Idaho had studied. It was a maze— first one direction and then another through corridors wide enough and high enough to accommodate the Royal Cart. Idaho lost track of directions and fell to reflecting on the preceding night.\nThe sleeping quarters in Goygoa, although Spartan and small, had been comfortable—two cots to a room, each\nroom a box with white-washed walls, a single window and a single door. The rooms were strung along a corridor ina building designated as Goygoa’s “Guest House.”\nAnd Siona had been right. Without asking if it suited him, Idaho had been quartered with her, Inmeir acting as though this were an accepted thing.\nWhen the door closed on them, Siona said: “If you touch me, | will try to kill you.”\nIt was uttered with such dry sincerity that Idaho almost laughed. “I would prefer privacy,” he said. “Consider yourself alone.”\nHe had slept with a light wariness, remembering dangerous nights in the Atreides service, the readiness for combat. The room was seldom truly dark—moonlight coming through the curtained window, even starlight reflecting from the chalk-white walls. He had found himself nervously sensitive to Siona, to the smell of her, the stirrings, her breathing. Several times he had come fully awake to listen, aware on two of those occasions that she, too, was listening.\nMorning and the flight to Onn had come as a relief. They had broken their fast with a drink of cold fruit juice, Idaho glad to enter the predawn darkness for a brisk walk to the ‘thopter. He did not speak directly to Siona and he found himself resenting the curious glances of the Fish Speakers.\nSiona spoke to him only once, leaning out of the ‘thopter as he left it in the plaza.\n“It would not offend me to be your friend,” she said.\nSuch a curious way of putting it. He had felt vaguely embarrassed. “Yes... well, certainly.”\nThe new escort had led him away then, coming at last to a terminal in the maze. Leto awaited him there on the Royal Cart. The meeting place was a wide spot in a corridor which stretched off into the converging distance on Idaho’s right. The walls were dark brown streaked with golden lines which glittered in the yellow light of glowglobes. The escort took\nup positions behind the cart, moving smartly and leaving Idaho to stand confronting Leto’s cowled face.\n“Duncan, you will precede me when we go to Siaynog,” Leto said.\nIdaho stared into the dark blue wells of the God Emperor’s eyes, angered by the mystery and secrecy, the obvious air of private excitement in this place. He felt that everything he had been told about Siaynog only deepened the mystery.\n“Am | truly the Commander of your Guard, m’Lord?” Idaho asked, resentment heavy in his voice.\n“Indeed! And | bestow a signal honor upon you now. Few adult males ever share Siaynoq.”\n“What happened in the city last night?”\n“Bloody violence in some places. It is quite calm this morning, however.”\n“Casualties?”\n“Not worth mentioning.”\nIdaho nodded. Leto’s prescient powers had warned of some peril to his Duncan. Thus, the flight into the rural safety of Goygoa.\n“You have been to Goygoa,” Leto said. “Were you tempted to stay?”\n“No!”\n“Do not be angry with me,” Leto said. “I did not send you to Goygoa.”\nIdaho sighed. “What was the danger which required that you send me away?”\n“It was not to you,” Leto said. “But you excite my guards to excessive displays of their abilities. Last night’s activities did not require this.”\n“Oh?” This thought shocked Idaho. He had never thought of himself as one to inspire particular heroism unless he personally demanded it. One whipped up the troops. Leaders such as the original Leto, this one’s grandfather, had inspired by their presence.\n“You are extremely precious to me, Duncan,” Leto said.\n“Yes... well, I’m still not your stud!”\n“Your wishes will be honored, of course. We will discuss it another time.”\nIdaho glanced at the Fish Speaker escort, all of them wide-eyed and attentive.\n“Is there always violence when you come to Onn?” Idaho asked.\n“It goes in cycles. The malcontents are quite subdued now. It will be more peaceful for a time.”\nIdaho looked back at Leto’s inscrutable face. “What happened to my predecessor?”\n“Haven't my Fish Speakers told you?”\n“They say he died in defense of his God.”\n“And you have heard a contrary rumor.”\n“What happened?”\n“He died because he was too close to me. | did not remove him to a Safe place in time.”\n“A place like Goygoa.”\n“I would have preferred him to live out his days there in peace, but you well know, Duncan, that you are not a seeker after peace.”\nIdaho swallowed, encountering an odd lump in his throat. “I would still like the particulars of his death. He has a family...”\n“You will get the particulars and do not fear for his family. They are my wards. | will keep them safely at a distance. You know how violence seeks me out. That is one of my functions. It is unfortunate that those | admire and love must suffer because of this.”\nIdaho pursed his lips, not satisfied with what he heard.\n“Set your mind at ease, Duncan,” Leto said. “Your predecessor died because he was too close to me.”\nThe Fish Speaker escort stirred restively. Idaho glanced at them, then looked to the right up the tunnel.\n“Yes, it is time,” Leto said. “We must not keep the women\nwaiting. March close ahead of me, Duncan, and | will answer\nyour questions about Siaynoq.”\nObedient because he could think of no suitable alternative, Idaho turned on his heel and led off the procession. He heard the cart creak into motion behind him, the faint footsteps of the escort following.\nThe cart fell silent with an abruptness which jerked Idaho’s attention around. The reason was immediately apparent.\n“You're on the suspensors,” he said, returning his attention to the front.\n“I have retracted the wheels because the women will press close around me,” Leto said. “We can’t crush their feet.”\n“What is Siaynoq? What is it really?” Idaho asked.\n“I have told you. It is the Great Sharing.”\n“Do | smell spice?”\n“Your nostrils are sensitive. There is a small amount of melange in the wafers.”\nIdaho shook his head.\nTrying to understand this event, Idaho had asked Leto directly at the first opportunity after their arrival in Onn, “What is the Feast of Siaynoq?”\n“We share a wafer, no more. Even | partake.”\n“Is it like the Orange Catholic ritual?”\n“Oh, no! It is not my flesh. It is the sharing. They are reminded that they are only female, as you are only male, but | am all. They share with the all.”\nIdaho had not liked the tone of this. “Only male?”\n“Do you know who they lampoon at the Feast, Duncan?”\n“Who?”\n“Men who have offended them. Listen to them when they talk softly among themselves.”\nIdaho had taken this as a warning: Don’t offend the Fish Speakers. You incur their wrath at your mortal peril!\nNow, as he marched ahead of Leto in the tunnel, Idaho felt that he had heard the words correctly but learned nothing from them. He spoke over his shoulder.\n“| don’t understand the Sharing.”\n“We are together in the ritual. You will see it. You will feel it. My Fish Speakers are the repository of a special knowledge, an unbroken line which only they share. Now, you will partake of it and they will love you for it. Listen to them carefully. They are open to ideas of affinity. Their terms of endearment for each other have no reservations.”\nMore words, |daho thought. More mystery.\nHe could discern a gradual widening in the tunnel; the ceiling sloped higher. There were more glowglobes, tuned now into the deep orange. He could see the high arch of an opening about three hundred meters away, rich red light there in which he could make out glistening faces which swayed gently left", " at your mortal peril!\nNow, as he marched ahead of Leto in the tunnel, Idaho felt that he had heard the words correctly but learned nothing from them.

He could see the high arch of an opening about three hundred meters away, rich red light there in which he could make out glistening faces which swayed gently left and right. Their bodies below the faces presented a dark wall of clothing. The perspiration of excitement was thick here.\nAs he neared the waiting women, Idaho saw a passage through them and a ramp slanting up to a low ledge on his right. A great arched ceiling curved away above the women, a gigantic space illuminated by glowglobes tuned high into the red.\n“Go up the ramp on your right,” Leto said. “Stop just beyond the center of the ledge and turn to face the women.”\nIdaho lifted his right hand in acknowledgment. He was emerging into the open space now and the dimensions of this enclosed place awed him. He set his trained eyes the task of estimating the dimensions as he mounted to the ledge and guessed the hall to be at least eleven hundred meters on a side—a square with rounded corners. It was packed with women, and Idaho reminded himself that these were only the chosen representatives of the far scattered Fish Speaker regiments—three women from each planet.\nThey stood now, their bodies pressed so closely together that Idaho doubted one of them could fall. They had left only a space about fifty meters wide along the ledge where Idaho now stopped and surveyed the scene. The faces looked up at him—faces, faces.\nLeto stopped his cart just behind Idaho and lifted one of his silver-skinned arms.\nImmediately, a roaring cry of “Siaynoq! Siaynoq!” filled the great hall.\nIdaho was deafened by it. Surely that sound must be heard throughout the City, he thought. Unless we are too far underground.\n“My brides,” Leto said. “I welcome you to Siaynog.”\nIdaho glanced up at Leto, saw the dark eyes glistening, the radiant expression. Leto had said: “This cursed holiness!” But he basked in it.\nHas Moneo ever seen this gathering? Idaho wondered. It was an odd thought, but Idaho knew its origin. There had to be some other mortal human with whom this could be discussed. The escort had said Moneo was dispatched on “affairs of state” whose details they did not know. Hearing this, Idaho had felt himself sense another element in Leto’s government. The lines of power extended directly from Leto out into the populace, but the lines did not often cross. That required many things, including trusted servants who would accept responsibility for carrying out orders without question.\n“Few see the God Emperor do hurtful things,” Siona had said. “Is that like the Atreides you knew?”\nIdaho looked out over the massed Fish Speakers as these thoughts flitted through his mind. The adulation in their eyes! The awe! How had Leto done this? Why?\n“My beloveds,” Leto said. His voice boomed out over the upturned faces, carried to the farthest corners by subtle Ixian amplifiers concealed in the Royal Cart.\nThe steaming images of the women’s faces filled Idaho with memory of Leto’s warning. /ncur their wrath at your mortal peril!\nIt was easy to believe that warning in this place. One word from Leto and these women would tear an offender to pieces. They would not question. They would act. Idaho began to feel a new appreciation of these women as an army. Personal peril would not stop them. They served God!\nThe Royal Cart creaked slightly as Leto arched his front segments upward, lifting his head.\n“You are the keepers of the faith!” Leto said.\nThey replied as one voice: “Lord, we obey!”\n“In me you live without end!” Leto said.\n“We are the Infinite!” they shouted.\n“I love you as | love no others!” Leto said.\n“Love!” they screamed.\nIdaho shuddered.\n“I give you my beloved Duncan!” Leto said.\n“Love!” they screamed.\nIdaho felt his whole body trembling. He felt that he might collapse from the weight of this adulation. He wanted to run away and he wanted to stay and accept this. There was power in this room. Power!\nIn a lower voice, Leto said: “Change the Guard.”\nThe women bowed their heads, a single movement, unhesitating. From off to Idaho’s right a line of women in white gowns appeared. They marched into the open space below the ledge and Idaho noted that some of them carried babies and small children, none more than a year or two old.\nFrom the outline explanation provided him earlier, Idaho recognized these women as the ones leaving the immediate service of the Fish Speakers. Some would become priestesses and some would spend full time as mothers... but none would truly leave Leto’s service.\nAs he looked down on the children, Idaho thought how the buried memory of this experience must be impressed on any of the male children. They would carry the mystery of it throughout their lives, a memory lost to consciousness but always present, shading responses from this moment onward.\nThe last of the newcomers came to a stop below Leto and looked up at him. The other women in the hall now lifted their faces and focused on Leto.\nIdaho glanced left and right. The whiteclad women filled the space below the ledge for at least five hundred meters in both directions. Some of them lifted their children toward Leto. The awe and submission was something absolute. If Leto ordered it, Idaho sensed, these women would smash their babies to death against the ledge. They would do anything!\nLeto lowered his front segments onto the cart, a gentle rippling motion. He peered down benignly and his voice came as a Soft caress. “I give you the reward which your faith and service have earned. Ask and it shall be given.”\nThe entire hall reverberated to the response: “It shall be given!”\n“What is mine is thine,” Leto said.\n“What is mine is thine,” the women shouted.\n“Share with me now,” Leto said, “the silent prayer for my intercession in all things—that humankind may never end.”\nAs one, every head in the hall bowed. The whiteclad women cradled their children close, looking down at them. Idaho felt the silent unity, a force which sought to enter him and take him over. He opened his mouth wide and breathed deeply, fighting against something which he sensed as a physical invasion. His mind searched frantically for something to which he could cling, something to shield him.\nThese women were an army whose force and union Idaho had not suspected. He knew he did not understand this force. He could only observe it, recognize that it existed.\nThis was what Leto had created.\nLeto’s words from a meeting at the Citadel came back to Idaho: “Loyalty in a male army fastens onto the army itself rather than onto the civilization which fosters the army. Loyalty in a female army fastens onto the leader.”\nIdaho stared out across the visible evidence of Leto’s creation, seeing the penetrating accuracy of those words, fearing that accuracy.\nHe offers me a share in this, Idaho thought.\nHis own response to Leto’s words struck Idaho now as puerile.\n“| don’t see the reason,” Idaho had said.\n“Most people are not creatures of reason.”\n“No army, male or female, guarantees peace! Your Empire isn’t peaceful! You only...”\n“My Fish Speakers have provided you with our histories?”\n“Yes, but I’ve also walked about in your city and I’ve watched your people. Your people are aggressive!”\n“You see, Duncan? Peace encourages aggression.”\n“And you say that your Golden Path...”\n“Is not precisely peace. It is tranquility, a fertile ground for the growth of rigid classes and many other forms of aggression.”\n“You talk riddles!”\n“I talk accumulated observations which tell me that the peaceful posture is the posture of the defeated. It is the posture of the victim. Victims invite aggression.”\n“Your damned enforced tranquility! What good does it do?”\n“If there is no enemy, one must be invented. The military force which is denied an external target always turns against its own people.”\n“What’s your game?”\n“I modify the human desire for war.”\n“People don’t want war!”\n“They want chaos. War is the most readily available form of chaos.”\n“| don’t believe any of this! You’re playing some dangerous game of your own.”\n“Very dangerous. | address ancient wellsprings of human behavior to redirect them. The danger is that | could suppress the forces of human survival. But | assure you that my Golden Path endures.”\n“You haven’t suppressed antagonism!”\n“| dissipate energies in one place and point them toward another place. What you cannot control, you harness.”\n“What’s to keep your female army from taking over?”\n“lam their leader.”\nAs he looked out over the massed women in the great hall, Idaho could not deny the focus of leadership. He saw also that part of this adulation was directed at his own person. The temptation in this held him fixated—anything he wanted from them... anything! The latent power in this great hall was explosive. This realization forced him into a deeper questioning of Leto’s earlier words.\nLeto had said something about exploding violence. Even as he watched the women at their silent prayer, Idaho recalled what Leto had said: “Men are susceptible to class fixations. They create layered societies. The layered society is an ultimate invitation to violence. It does not fall apart. It explodes.”\n“Women never do this?”\n“Not unless they are almost completely male dominated or locked into a male-role model.”\n“The sexes can’t be that different!”\n“But they are. Women make common cause based on their sex, a cause which transcends class and caste. That is why I let my women hold the reins.”\nIdaho was forced to admit that these praying women held the reins.\nWhat part of that power would he pass into my hands?\nThe temptation was monstrous! Idaho found himself trembling with it. With chilling abruptness, he realized that this must be Leto’s intention—to tempt me!\nOn the floor of the great hall, the women finished their prayer and lifted their gaze to Leto. Idaho felt that he had never before seen such rapture in human faces—not in the ecstasy of sex, not in glorious victory-at-arms—nowhere had he seen anything to approach this intense adulation.\n“Duncan Idaho stands beside me today,” Leto said. “Duncan is here to declare his loyalty that all may hear it. Duncan?”\nIdaho felt a physical chill shoot through his intestines. Leto gave him a simple choice: Declare your loyalty to the God Emperor or die!\nlf | sneer, vacillate or object in any way, the women will kill me with their own hands.\nA deep anger suffused Idaho. He swallowed, cleared his throat, then: “Let no one question my loyalty. | am loyal to the Atreides.”\nHe heard his own voice booming out over the room, amplified by Leto’s Ixian device.\nThe effect startled Idaho.\n“We share!” the women screamed. “We"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_bca5912ef7b3308bbdea6a8e2e7516c0eebe9f31abf984cbc55b374e52772759_v2"}
