As Emperor, he was deeply invested in maintaining his power and CHOAM profits, often engaging in the intricate political machinations of the Great Houses. His forces were notably stationed near Arrakeen, reflecting his strategic interest in the planet and its valuable spice melange, which he used as a testing ground for imperial policies.  \n\nShaddam IV's reign came to an end when he was deposed by **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)**, marking the fall of House Corrino's direct rule over the Imperium. This defeat was a pivotal historical event, cementing the rise of the Atreides dynasty. Following his overthrow, Shaddam IV was later referred to as the \"\"late Padishah Emperor,\"\" remembered as the father of **Princess Irulan** and the grandfather of **Farad'n**. His legacy persisted in the thoughts of figures like **Ghanima**, who acknowledged his role in the imperial lineage.  \n\nThough some descriptions note his jealousy and political maneuvering, others emphasize his historical significance as the last Corrino Emperor before the Atreides ascendancy. Despite contradictions in phrasing (such as being called both \"\"deposed\"\" and \"\"late\"\"), the consistent narrative is that Shaddam IV was a powerful but ultimately unsuccessful ruler whose downfall reshaped the political landscape of the Known Universe.
