How illuminating it is to peer backward through a perfect circle at that ancient struggle for the visible moment of the soul. All time vibrates to that call: “Here | am!” With a mind informed by artist- giants who came afterward, | peer at handprints and flowing muscles drawn upon the rock with charcoal and vegetable dyes. How much more we are than mere mechanical events! And my anticivil self demands: “Why is it that they do not want to leave the cave?”\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhe invitation to attend Moneo in his workroom came to\nIdaho late in the afternoon. All day, Idaho had sat upon the sling couch of his quarters, thinking. Every thought radiated outward from the ease with which Moneo had spilled him onto the corridor floor that morning.\n“You're just an older model.”\nWith every thought, Idaho felt himself diminished. He sensed the will to live as it faded, leaving ashes where his anger had burned itself out.\nl am the conveyance of some useful sperm and nothing more, he thought.\nIt was a thought which invited either death or hedonism. He felt himself impaled on a thorn of chance with irritating forces pecking at him from all sides.\nThe young messenger in her neat blue uniform was merely another irritation. She entered at his low-voiced response to her knock and she stopped under the arched portal from his anteroom, hesitating until she had assessed his mood.\nHow quickly the word travels, he thought.\nHe saw her there, framed in the portal, a projection of Fish Speaker essence—more voluptuous than some, but no more blatantly sexual. The blue uniform did not conceal graceful hips, firm breasts. He looked up at her puckish face under a brush of blonde hair—acolyte cut.\n“Moneo sends me to inquire after you,” she said. “He asks that you attend him in his workroom.”\nIdaho had seen that workroom several times, but still remembered it best from his first view of it. He had known on entering the room that it was where Moneo spent most of his time. There was a table of dark brown wood streaked by fine golden graining, a table about two meters by one meter and set low on stubby legs in the midst of gray cushions. The table had struck Idaho as something rare and expensive, chosen for a single accent. It and the cushions— which were the same gray as floor, walls and ceiling—were the only furnishings.\nConsidering the power of its occupant, the room was Small, no more than five meters by four, but with a high ceiling. Light came from two slender glazed windows opposite each other on the narrower walls. The windows looked out from a considerable height, one onto the northwest fringes of the Sareer and the bordering green of the Forbidden Forest, the other providing a southwest view over rolling dunes.\nContrast.\nThe table had put an interesting accent on this initial thought. The surface had appeared as an arrangement demonstrating the idea of c/utter. Thin sheets of crystal paper lay scattered across the surface, leaving only glimpses of the wood grain underneath. Fine printing covered some of the paper. Idaho recognized words in Galach and four other languages, including the rare transite tongue of Perth. Several sheets of the paper revealed plan drawings and some were scrawled with black strokes of brush-script in the bold style of the Bene Gesserit. Most\ninteresting of all had been four rolled white tubes about a meter long—tri-D printouts from an illegal computer. He had suspected the terminal lay concealed behind a panel in one of the walls.\nThe young messenger from Moneo cleared her throat to awaken Idaho from his reverie. “What response shall | return to Moneo?” she asked.\nIdaho focused on her face. “Would you like me to impregnate you?” he asked.\n“Commander!” She was obviously shocked not so much by his suggestion as by its non sequitur intrusion.\n“Ahhh, yes,” Idaho said. “Moneo. What shall we tell Moneo?”\n“He awaits your reply, Commander.”\n“Is there really any point in my responding?” Idaho asked.\n“Moneo told me to inform you that he wishes to confer with both you and the Lady Hwi together.”\nIdaho sensed a vague arousal of interest. “Hwi is with him?”\n“She has been summoned, Commander.” The messenger cleared her throat once more. “Would the Commander wish me to visit him here later tonight?”\n“No. Thank you, anyway. I’ve changed my mind.”\nHe thought she concealed her disappointment well, but her voice came out stiffly formal: “Shall | say that you will attend Moneo?”\n“Do that.” He waved her away.\nAfter she had gone, he considered just ignoring the summons. Curiosity grew in him, though. Moneo wanted to talk to him with Hwi present? Why? Did he think this would bring Idaho running? Idaho swallowed. When he thought of Hwi, the emptiness in his breast became full. The message of that could not be ignored. Something of terrible power bound him to Hwi.\nHe stood up, his muscles stiff after their long inaction. Curiosity and this binding force impelled him. He went out\ninto the corridor, ignored the curious glances of guards he passed, and followed that compelling inner force up to Moneo’s workroom.\nHwi was already there when Idaho entered the room. She was across the cluttered table from Moneo, her feet in red Slippers tucked back beside the gray cushion on which she sat. Idaho saw only that she wore a long brown gown with a braided green belt, then she turned and he could look at nothing except her face. Her mouth formed his name without speaking it.\nEven she has heard, he thought.\nOddly, this thought strengthened him. The thoughts of this day began to form new shapes in his mind.\n“Please sit down, Duncan,” Moneo said. He gestured to a cushion beside Hwi. His voice conveyed a curious, halting tone, a manner that few people other than Leto had ever observed in him. He kept his gaze directed downward at the cluttered surface of his table. The late afternoon sunlight cast a spidery shadow across the jumble from a golden paperweight in the shape of a fanciful tree with jeweled fruit, all mounted on a flame-crystal mountain.\nIdaho took the indicated cushion, watching Hwi’s gaze follow him until he was seated. She looked at Moneo then and he thought he saw anger in her expression. Moneo’s usual plain-white uniform was open at the throat, revealing a wrinkled neck and a bit of dewlap. Idaho stared into the man’s eyes, prepared to wait, forcing Moneo to open the conversation.\nMoneo returned the stare, noting that Idaho still wore the black uniform of their morning encounter. There was even a Small trace of grime down the front, memento of the corridor floor where Moneo had spilled him. But Idaho no longer wore the antique Atreides knife. That bothered Moneo.\n“What | did this morning was unforgivable,” Moneo said. “Therefore, | do not ask you to forgive me. | merely ask that\nyou try to understand.”\nHwi did not appear surprised by this opening, Idaho noted. It revealed much about what the two of them had been discussing before Idaho’s arrival.\nWhen Idaho did not respond, Moneo said: “I had no right to make you feel inadequate.”\nIdaho found himself undergoing a curious response to Moneo’s words and manner. There was still the feeling of being outmaneuvered and outclassed, too far from his time, but he no longer suspected that Moneo might be toying with him. Something had reduced the majordomo to a gritty substratum of honesty. The realization put Leto’s universe, the deadly eroticism of the Fish Speakers, Hwi’s undeniable candor—everything—into a new relationship, a form which Idaho felt that he understood. It was as though the three of them in this room were the last true humans in the entire universe. He spoke from a sense of wry self-deprecation:\n“You had every right to protect yourself when I attacked you. It pleases me that you were so capable.”\nIdaho turned toward Hwi, but before he could speak, Moneo said: “You needn’t plead for me. | think her displeasure toward me is quite adamant.”\nIdaho shook his head. “Does everyone here know what I’m going to say before | say it, what I’m going to feel before | feel it?”\n“One of your admirable qualities,” Moneo said. “You do not conceal your feelings. We”—he shrugged—“are necessarily more circumspect.”\nIdaho looked at Hwi. “Does he speak for you?”\nShe put her hand in Idaho’s. “I speak for myself.”\nMoneo craned to peer at the clasped hands, sank back on his cushion. He sighed. “You must not.”\nIdaho clasped her hand more tightly, felt her equal response.\n“Before either of you asks,” Moneo said, “my daughter and the God Emperor have not yet returned from the\ntesting.”\nIdaho sensed the effort Moneo had required to speak calmly. Hwi heard it, too.\n“Is it true what the Fish Speakers say?” she asked. “Siona dies if she fails?”\nMoneo remained silent, but his face was a rock.\n“Is it like the Bene Gesserit test?” Idaho asked. “Muad’Dib said the Sisterhood tests to try to find out if you are human.”\nHwi’s hand began to tremble. Idaho felt it and looked at her. “Did they test you?”\n“No,” Hwi said, “but | heard the young ones talking about it. They said you must pass through agony without losing your sense of self.”\nIdaho returned his attention to Moneo, noting the start of a tic beside the majordomo’s left eye.\n“Moneo,” Idaho breathed, overcome by sudden realization. “He tested you!”\n“I do not wish to discuss tests,” Moneo said. “We are here to decide what must be done about you two.”\n“Isn't that up to us?” Idaho asked. He felt Hwi’s hand in his grow slippery with perspiration.\n“It is up to the God Emperor,” Moneo said.\n“Even if Siona fails?” Idaho asked.\n“Especially then!”\n“How did he test you?” Idaho asked.\n“He showed me a small glimpse of what it’s like to be the God Emperor.”\n“And?”\n“I Saw as much as |’m capable of seeing.”\nHwi’s hand tightened convulsively in Idaho’s.\n“Then it’s true that you were a rebel once,” Idaho said.\n“I began with love and prayer,” Moneo said. “I changed to anger and rebellion. | was transformed into what you see before you. | recognize my duty and | do it.”\n“What did he do to you?” Idaho demanded.\n“He quoted to me the prayer of my childhood: ‘I give my life in dedication to the greater glory of God.’” Moneo spoke in a musing voice.\nIdaho noted Hwi’s stillness, her stare fixed on Moneo’s face. What was she thinking?\n“I admitted that this had been my prayer,” Moneo said. “And the God Emperor asked me what | would give up if my life were not enough. He shouted at me: ‘What is your life when you hold back the greater gift?’”\nHwi nodded, but Idaho felt only confusion.\n“I could hear the truth in his voice,” Moneo said.\n“Are you a Truthsayer?” Hwi asked.\n“In\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is the majordomo of the God Emperor, known for his honesty and duty, and a former rebel who was transformed by the God Emperor's test.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a character who feels diminished and out of place, grappling with his role and emotions, and is drawn to Hwi.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI<|>PERSON<|>Lady Hwi is a candid and compelling figure who shares a deep connection with Idaho and is involved in discussions with Moneo.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are a military and religious order serving the God Emperor, known for their discipline and loyalty.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with advanced mental and physical abilities, involved in political and genetic manipulation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAREE<|>GEO<|>The Sareer is a desert region bordering the Forbidden Forest, visible from Moneo's workroom.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORBIDDEN FOREST<|>GEO<|>The Forbidden Forest is a green area bordering the Sareer, mentioned in the view from Moneo's workroom.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>PERSON<|>The God Emperor is a central figure in the narrative, wielding immense power and influence over characters like Moneo and Idaho.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SONIA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is Moneo's daughter, undergoing a test by the God Emperor, with her life at stake.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>Moneo serves as the majordomo to the God Emperor and was transformed by his test<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>HWI<|>Idaho shares a deep emotional and possibly romantic connection with Hwi<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>MONEO<|>Idaho and Moneo have a complex relationship marked by conflict and mutual understanding<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>SONIA<|>Moneo is deeply concerned for his daughter Siona, who is undergoing a life-threatening test<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI<|>MONEO<|>Hwi and Moneo interact in discussions about Idaho and the God Emperor's will<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>The Fish Speakers serve the God Emperor with loyalty and discipline<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>GOD EMPEROR<|>The Bene Gesserit have a historical and possibly adversarial relationship with the God Emperor<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
