He is slightly overweight and known for interacting with 雄一, often borrowing or showing photographs for undisclosed purposes. Notably, 菊池 possesses a set of mysterious photos that may hold significance, including images potentially linking **桐原亮司's mother** to a past incident from four years ago. These photos are believed to be incriminating for 桐原, leading to speculation that 菊池 may have been framed by 桐原 to divert suspicion.  \n\n菊池's keychain was once lost and later found during an investigation, further connecting him to ongoing events. Despite his involvement, he has faced unfair treatment from the police due to his family's impoverished background and his mother's association with a shop owned by the **Kirihara family**. At one point, he was wrongly suspected in an incident but was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Following this, his demeanor toward 雄一 became noticeably colder.  \n\n菊池's role appears to be that of an unwitting participant caught in a larger web of intrigue, holding critical evidence while enduring social and institutional bias. His actions—such as sharing photos with 雄一 and 桐原—suggest he may be attempting to uncover or expose hidden truths, though his motives remain ambiguous.\",10\n7,真澄公园,\"**真澄公园** is the largest park in the vicinity of the incident scene, located near **布施车站 (Fuse Station)**. The park features common playground facilities and is adjacent to an unfinished or vacant building, which was the site of a significant incident—the murder of **桐原父亲 (Kirihara's father)**.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight the park's prominence in the area, emphasizing its size and recreational amenities. While the specifics of the incident are not detailed, the park's proximity to the unfinished building underscores its connection to the event. The two descriptions align in portraying **真澄公园** as a central location near the crime scene, with one providing additional context about its relation to **布施车站** and the tragic event involving **桐原父亲**.  \n\nIn summary, **真澄公园** serves as both a recreational space and a notable landmark tied to a pivotal incident, situated close to an unfinished building and **布施车站**. The park's features and location remain consistent across descriptions, with no major contradictions.\",3\n147,四年前谋杀案,\"桐原的父亲在真澄公园附近的大楼被杀，案件至今未破\"\"\",7\n149,菊池的弟弟,\"菊池的弟弟是四年前谋杀案尸体的第一发现者\"\"\",2\n158,中年男老师,,2\n148,当铺店员,\"桐原家当铺的前员工，被怀疑与桐原的母亲有外遇并参与谋杀\"\"\",2\n151,《无语问苍天》,\"四年前海报上的电影，用于确定照片拍摄时间\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n807,桐原的母亲,笹垣,笹垣是调查桐原亮父亲命案的刑警，曾多次确认桐原母亲的不在场证明。,62\n172,菊池,雄一,\"菊池 and 雄一 have a complex relationship marked by both casual interaction and underlying tension. On one hand, 菊池 has borrowed a photograph from 雄一, suggesting a degree of familiarity or casual friendship between them.

Despite 雄一's efforts, 菊池 harbors resentment toward him, suggesting that the rift between them has not been fully resolved.  \n\nIn summary, while 菊池 and 雄一 maintain some level of interaction—enough for 菊池 to borrow personal items from 雄一—their relationship is strained by unresolved grievances, with 菊池 holding a grudge despite 雄一's attempts at reconciliation.
