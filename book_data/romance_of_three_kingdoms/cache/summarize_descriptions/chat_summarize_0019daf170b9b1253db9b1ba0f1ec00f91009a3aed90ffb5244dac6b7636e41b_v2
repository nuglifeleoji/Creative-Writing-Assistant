This concept encompasses a series of secret strategies and plans that Kong Ming devised to ensure the stability and success of his allies during tumultuous times.\n\nOne of the key events associated with the 锦囊 is when Kong Ming entrusts a secret plan to Yang Yi, outlining a strategy for managing the potential threat posed by Wei Yan following his death. This indicates the foresight and strategic depth of Kong Ming, as he prepared for possible challenges even in the face of loss.\n\nAdditionally, the 锦囊 serves as a crucial resource for Liu Bei, providing him with strategies to navigate crises effectively. These strategies are revealed during a critical escape, highlighting their importance in ensuring the survival and resilience of Liu Bei's forces.\n\nMoreover, the 锦囊 is characterized as a secret strategy document left by Kong Ming, containing specific instructions on how to handle Wei Yan in the event of a rebellion. This underscores the significance of the document as a tactical guide, reflecting Kong Ming's role as a master strategist who anticipated potential conflicts and prepared accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, the 锦囊 includes three vital strategies given to Zhao Yun by Kong Ming, which are essential for safeguarding the interests of Xuande (Liu Bei). These strategies not only demonstrate Kong Ming's strategic acumen but also his commitment to the success and safety of his allies.\n\nIn summary, the 锦囊 represents a collection of critical strategies and plans devised by Kong Ming, aimed at addressing potential threats and ensuring the success of his allies during the chaotic period of the Three Kingdoms. Through his foresight and strategic planning, Kong Ming left a lasting legacy that would guide figures like Liu Bei and Zhao Yun in their endeavors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754898764, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 379, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 636, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
