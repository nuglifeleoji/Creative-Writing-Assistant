It is recognized as a significant battleground, often contested by various warlords, including Cao Cao, Liu Bei, Lü Bu, and Sun Ce. The city serves as a strategic military location, making it a focal point in the power struggles of the time.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, 徐州 became a site of conflict, particularly under the threat of Cao Cao's army, which sought to exert control over the region. This led to political and military maneuvers, with local leaders like Tao Qian seeking assistance to defend against Cao Cao's forces. The city was governed by Liu Bei, who faced the challenge of protecting 徐州 from the advancing army. The strategic importance of 徐州 is underscored by its role in various military actions and negotiations, including those involving Lü Bu, who returned to the city after a negotiation.\n\n徐州's significance is further highlighted by its association with key historical figures and events. It was a location where alliances were formed and broken, and where military strategies were devised. The city not only served as a battleground but also as a center for political intrigue, as seen in the interactions between its leaders and the warlords vying for control.\n\nIn summary, 徐州 is a historically rich city that was central to the conflicts of the late Eastern Han dynasty, characterized by its strategic military importance and its role as a contested territory among powerful warlords.
