This system serves as a crucial technological means through which 叶文洁 seeks to establish contact with extraterrestrial entities, specifically targeting the sun as a point of transmission. This act of sending a signal is pivotal in the storyline, as it represents a significant moment of human endeavor to reach out beyond Earth and engage with the cosmos.\n\nSecondly, \"\"信号\"\" also refers to the messages that are received from the 三体世界 (Trisolaran world) and other celestial bodies. These messages indicate various communication attempts from these distant worlds, suggesting an ongoing dialogue or interaction between humanity and extraterrestrial civilizations. The signals received from the 三体世界 are particularly important, as they reveal the complexities and challenges of interstellar communication, highlighting the potential for both understanding and conflict between different forms of life.\n\nIn summary, \"\"信号\"\" embodies both the proactive efforts of 叶文洁 to communicate with the sun through the 红岸发射系统 and the subsequent reception of messages from the 三体世界 and other celestial entities.
