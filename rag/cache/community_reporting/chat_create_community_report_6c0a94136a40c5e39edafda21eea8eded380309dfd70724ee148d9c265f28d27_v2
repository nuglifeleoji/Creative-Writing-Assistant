They specialize in creating sophisticated devices, ranging from navigation tools and chronometers to the cibus hood, the Royal Cart, and even satellites. Their innovations, such as the \"\"no-room\"\" technology, allow them to conceal their activities from prescient beings like Leto II, furthering their reputation for secrecy and subterfuge.  \n\nPolitically, the Ixians are often in conflict with the Bene Gesserit and the God Emperor, employing both technological and psychological strategies to undermine their rivals. Notably, they engineered Hwi Noree—a paradoxically anti-mechanical individual—to emotionally manipulate Leto II. They collaborate with factions like the Fish Speakers and the Tleilaxu, though their alliances are opportunistic. Their involvement in espionage, including the theft of Leto’s sacred books and the creation of a machine for the Guild, underscores their role as master schemers.  \n\nDespite their contributions, the Ixians are viewed with suspicion. Leto II criticizes their limitations, even as he tolerates their inventions. Rumors persist of their experiments with artificial intelligence, violating ancient taboos.
