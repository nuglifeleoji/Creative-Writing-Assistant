“娜娜、娜娜……”又叫了两声，找遍了所有房间。云琰的脸色顿时变得难看起来。\n\n    娜娜平时根本就不会单独外出啊！\n\n    她迅速拨通了娜娜的魂导通讯器，可另一边传来的却是忙音。\n\n    魂导通讯器内有定位装置，但如果强行关闭的话，定位也会随之关闭。对于现代人来说，这几乎是不可能出现的情况，因为每个人对于魂导通讯器都有着非常强的依赖性。可现在很显然，娜娜应该是把自己的通讯器关闭了。\n\n    四下找了找。她看到了一张纸。\n\n    “云琰，我要出去一段时间。我找到了一些自己想要做的事情。不用来找我。等事情办完了，我自然就回来了。也或许，不会回来吧。——娜娜”\n\n    只是这么一句简单的留言，云琰看了之后，却是汗都下来了。作为监护人，自己的监护对象失踪了，而且还说或许不会回来，这让她怎么向上面交代啊！\n\n    不敢怠慢，云琰飞速的拨通了一个号码……\n\n    宇宙飞船顺利的冲出大气层，又进入到了漫长而平稳的飞行过程之中。来的时候七天，回去的时候自然也还是七天的时间。\n\n    踏上归程，南澄和蓝潇都有些昏昏欲睡。旅行总是归程会更觉得疲惫，甚至还会有些不舍。\n\n    没有再见到娜娜，蓝潇心中是有些释然的，他当然认为这是好事。就当是一份巧遇吧。他更希望的是一家人的平安，倒不是儿子的出人头地。一切顺其自然就好。\n\n    蓝轩宇的情绪也算是平静了下来，看着窗外的太空，不时会有些楞神。\n\n    太空真的很美呢，美的寂静。星光是唯一的点缀。浩渺无垠的太空带给他的，是一种自由的感觉。\n\n    他的护罩是开启了的，七天时间，最好的打发办法自然还是冥想。\n\n    自从那天在叶锋的压迫下他的银纹蓝银草出现了一些变化之后，蓝轩宇发现，自己的玄天功运转似乎也顺畅了一些。这自然是因为精神力增强之后，对于自身魂力的掌控也随之变强了。总算是快了点。让他有种快要突破到十二级魂力的感觉了。\n\n    从十一级到十二级，这已经过了半年多的时间，可绝对算不上提升的快了。\n\n    “轩宇。”正在这时，一个悦耳而温柔的声音突然在他脑海中响起。\n\n    几乎完全是下意识的，蓝轩宇就坐直了身体，向四下看去。喃喃的自言自语道：“娜娜阿姨，是你吗？”\n\n    这声音太熟悉了，让他一下就认了出来。\n\n    “你坐好，不要动。是我。”娜娜的声音再次在他脑海中响起。\n\n
