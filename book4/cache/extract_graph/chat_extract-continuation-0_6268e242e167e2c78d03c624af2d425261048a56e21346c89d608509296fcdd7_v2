线衣，外面是一身廉价混纺毛料制服；足登“力士”牌球鞋；头上戴一顶深蓝的卡单帽，手里象其他生意人一样提着黑人造革皮包（也可斜着大背在身上）。当然，这身打扮在城里人看来仍然是个土包子，但在农村，就算得“洋”了。秀莲坚持要让他这样改头换面。少安自己也感觉到，到城里办事，一身老百姓衣服实在蹬打不开。穿着这身新衣服，开始时还怪有点别扭，以后慢慢也就习惯了…… \n　　现在，孙少安就是这么一副装束，坐在原西县国营食堂的小餐厅里。 \n　　他正在这里请客吃饭——当然是为了销售他的砖。 \n　　客人是原西县百货公司的正副经理和这个单位管基建的干部。副经理我们已经熟悉了——跛女子侯玉英的父亲侯生才。正是因为少平当年曾经在洪水中救过侯生才的女儿，这笔生意使孙少安多赚了不少钱。百货公司要新盖一座三层楼的门市部，需要大量的砖。有许多砖厂在竞争这个大买主。当主管基建的副经理侯生才知道少安就是少平的哥哥后，毫不犹豫把好处先给了他；并且每块砖出价四分——这比当时通行的价格高出二厘。侯生才的“理由”是，少安的砖好。当然，少安的砖确实也好，压力系数都在一百号以上（七十五号以上就是国家标准）。 \n　　为了感激慷慨的侯经理，少安就在县国营食堂的小餐厅里搞了这桌饭。从原西水平来说，这桌饭菜已经属最高层次了。桌上有山珍海味，还上了各种酒。少安殷勤地为那三个人夹菜劝酒，尽量使自己的风度象那么一回事；生活已迫使一个封闭的乡下人向外部世界开放。 \n　　吃菜唱酒的时候，孙少安无限感慨地想起，当年就是在这地方，他和润叶曾经一块吃过一顿饭。那顿饭是润叶请他的。那时，他是何等的窘迫与牺惶啊！谁能想到，今天他能在这同一个地方，铺张地请别人吃宴席呢？ \n　　他由不得想起了润叶——这几年，他很少再想起这个曾经爱过他的人。对于一个在实际生活中陷入千头万绪矛盾中的农民来说，没有那么多闲暇勾起自己的浪漫情思。不过一旦想起这个人，他就会想起自己整整一段生活历史；不仅是当年他和润叶的关系，还有他自己和一家人曾经度过的那无比艰难的岁月…… \n　　他在饭桌上的情绪突然低落下来。此则，他痛苦地想到，他们家其他人的情况眼下仍不景气。分家以后，父亲的负担加重了，那么大年纪，还得象小伙子一般出山劳动。弟弟一个人流落门外，谁知成了一种什么样子。姐姐家的状况\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
