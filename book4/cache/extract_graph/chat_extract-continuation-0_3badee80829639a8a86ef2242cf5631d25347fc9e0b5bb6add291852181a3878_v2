他的人，一听说他回来了，立刻兴奋地纷纷从金家湾和田家圪崂赶到了他的砖场。人们笑逐颜开地抚摸着他买回来的庞然大物，把这钢铁家伙看成是他们共同的财神爷。田五在闹哄哄的人群中说开了“链子嘴”——孙少安，走河南，买回个东西不简单，嘴里吞下泥疙瘩，屁股后面就屙砖！ \n　　众人的热烈情绪使少安深受感动。在生活中，因为你而使周围的人充满希望和欢乐，这会给你带来多大的满足！ \n                  第14章\n　　几天之后，卖瓦盆的河南人不失前约，如期地来到了少安门上。 \n　　河南师傅一到，少安的砖场就重新开张了。他一下子雇用了村中三十几号人马，开始另建四个大烧砖窑；同时开动新买回的大型制砖机，打制砖坯。 \n　　自实行责任制以来，双水村还没有过这么多人聚在一块劳动。村子南头这个小山湾里，机器的吼叫和喧腾的人声不免叫人想起当年农业学大寨的场面。但今非昔比，这里不再有红旗和高音喇叭，而是主要的是，这砖场属于孙少安个人，其他人都是来赚他的“工资”——男劳一天三元，女劳一天一元五角。少安的媳妇贺秀莲，脸上带着出人头地的满足，既是她丈夫的“副统帅”，又是给众人记工的会计。所有来这里干活的人，都是双水村目前的“穷人”；有田家圪崂的，也有金家湾的。孙少安尽量满足了村里所有想来他这里赚几个紧用钱的村民。有些家户的男劳还要忙自家地里的农活，他就让他们的婆姨和子女来上他的工。他的行为大得人心，双水村有许多人为他歌功颂德。 \n　　他二妈贺凤英也来了。她还当着村里的妇女主任，只不过这职务早成了个名义。几年来，她和她丈夫在村里都没什么“工作”可做。那光景依旧过得没楞没沿，她不得不屈驾来侄儿这里赚几个买化肥的钱。少安夫妻不好意思叫二妈也和众人一样去刨土挖泥，只好让她帮秀莲在家里做饭。 \n　　孙少安搞起这么大摊场，又雇用了村里这么多人，在东拉河前后村庄马上传扬开来，有些邻近村庄没办法的庄稼人，也跑来想上他的工。他赶快婉言谢绝了。现在这么多人就够他心惊胆颤的——一月下来光工钱就得开两三千块！实际上，他最多用二十几个人就够了，只是因为同村人抹不开面子，才用了如此多的人——他这样做完全是出于一种人情和道义感，而不是他有多大经济实力。 \n　　众人在这时当然不能象在自己地里干活，可以随便晚出早归，得象以前的生产队一样，天\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a central figure in the community
