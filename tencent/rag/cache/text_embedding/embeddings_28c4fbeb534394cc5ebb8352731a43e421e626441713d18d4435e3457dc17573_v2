And the music was pleasant, a thin wailing played against flat tympani from gourd drums and clapped hands.\nAbruptly the music was drowned beneath a roaring of many voices from the plaza’s far side. The dancers missed a step, recovered in a brief confusion, but they had lost their sensuous singleness, and even their attention wandered to the far gate of the plaza, where a mob could be seen\nspreading onto the stones like water rushing through the opened valve of a qanat.\nAlia stared at that oncoming wave.\nShe heard words now, and one above all others: “Preacher! Preacher!”\nThen she saw him, striding with the first spread of the wave, one hand on the shoulder of his young guide.\nThe pilgrim dancers gave up their whirling, retired to the terraced steps below Alia. They were joined by their audience, and Alia sensed awe in the watchers. Her own emotion was fear.\nHow dare he!\nShe half turned to summon guards, but second thoughts stopped her. The mob already filled the plaza. They could turn ugly if thwarted in their obvious desire to hear the blind visionary.\nAlia clenched her fists.\nThe Preacher! Why was Paul doing this? To half the population he was a “desert madman” and, therefore, sacred. Others whispered in the bazaars and shops that it must be Muad’Dib. Why else did the Mahdinate let him speak such angry heresy?\nAlia could see refugees among the mob, remnants from the abandoned sietches, their robes in tatters. That would be a dangerous place down there, a place where mistakes could be made.\n“Mistress?”\nThe voice came from behind Alia. She turned, saw Zia standing in the arched doorway to the outer chamber. Armed House Guards were close behind her.\n“Yes, Zia?”\n“My Lady, Farad’n is out here requesting audience.”\n“Here? In my chambers?”\n“Yes, My Lady.”\n“Is he alone?”\n“Two bodyguards and the Lady Jessica.”\nAlia put a hand to her throat, remembering her last encounter with her mother. Times had changed, though. New conditions ruled their relationship.\n“How impetuous he is,” Alia said. “What reason does he give?”\n“He has heard about...” Zia pointed to the window over the plaza. “He says he was told you have the best vantage.”\nAlia frowned. “Do you believe this, Zia?”\n“No, My Lady. | think he has heard the rumors. He wants to watch your reaction.”\n“My mother put him up to this!”\n“Quite possibly, My Lady.”\n“Zia, my dear, | want you to carry out a specific set of very important orders for me. Come here.”\nZia approached to within a pace. “My Lady?”\n“Have Farad’n, his guards, and my mother admitted. Then prepare to bring Ghanima. She is to be accoutered as a Fremen bride in every detail—complete.”\n“With knife, My Lady?”\n“With knife.”\n“My Lady, that’s—”\n“Ghanima poses no threat to me.”\n“My Lady, there’s reason to believe she fled with Stilgar more to protect him than for any other—”\n“Zia!”\n“My Lady?”\n“Ghanima already has made her plea for Stilgar’s life and Stilgar remains alive.”\n“But she’s the heir presumptive!”\n“Just carry out my orders. Have Ghanima prepared. While you're seeing to that, send five attendants from the Temple Priesthood out into the plaza. They’re to invite The Preacher up here. Have them wait their opportunity and speak to him, nothing more. They are to use no force. | want them to issue a polite invitation. Absolutely no force. And Zia...”\n“My Lady?” How sullen she sounded.\n“The Preacher and Ghanima are to be brought before me simultaneously. They are to enter together upon my signal. Do you understand?”\n“I know the plan, My Lady, but—”\n“Just do it! Together.” And Alia nodded dismissal to the amazon aide. As Zia turned and left, Alia said: “On your way out, send in Farad’n’s party, but see that they’re preceded by ten of your most trustworthy people.”\nZia glanced back but continued leaving the room. “It will be done as you command, My Lady.”\nAlia turned away to peer out the window. In just a few minutes the p/an would bear its bloody fruit. And Paul would be here when his daughter delivered the coup de grace to his holy pretensions. Alia heard Zia’s guard detachment entering. It would be over soon. All over. She looked down with a swelling sense of triumph as The Preacher took his stance on the first step. His youthful guide squatted beside him. Alia saw the yellow robes of Temple Priests waiting on the left, held back by the press of the crowd. They were experienced with crowds, however. They’d find a way to approach their target. The Preacher’s voice boomed out over the plaza, and the mob waited upon his words with rapt attention. Let them listen! Soon his words would be made to mean things other than he intended. And there’d be no Preacher around to protest.\nShe heard Farad’n’s party enter, Jessica’s voice. “Alia?”\nWithout turning Alia said: “Welcome, Prince Farad’n, mother. Come and enjoy the show.” She glanced back then, saw the big Sardaukar, Tyekanik, scowling at her guards who were blocking the way. “But this isn’t hospitable,” Alia said. “Let them approach.” Two of her guards, obviously acting on Zia’s orders, came up to her and stood between her and the others. The other guards moved aside. Alia backed to the right side of the window, motioned to it. “This is truly the best vantage point.”\nJessica, wearing her traditional black aba robe, glared at Alia, escorted Farad’n to the window, but stood between him and Alia’s guards.\n“This is very kind of you, Lady Alia,” Farad’n said. “I’ve heard so much about this Preacher.”\n“And there he is in the flesh,” Alia said. She saw that Farad’n wore the dress grey of a Sardaukar commander without decorations. He moved with a lean grace which Alia admired. Perhaps there would be more than idle amusement in this Corrino Prince.\nThe Preacher’s voice boomed into the room over the amplifier pickups beside the window. Alia felt the tremors of it in her bones, began to listen to his words with growing fascination.\n“| found myself in the Desert of Zan,” The Preacher shouted, “in that waste of howling wilderness. And God commanded me to make that place clean. For we were provoked in the desert, and grieved in the desert, and we were tempted in that wilderness to forsake our ways.”\nDesert of Zan, Alia thought. That was the name given to the place of the first trial of the Zensunni Wanderers from whom the Fremen sprang. But his words! Was he taking credit for the destruction wrought against the sietch strongholds of the loyal tribes?\n“Wild beasts lie upon your lands,” The Preacher said, his voice booming across the plaza. “Doleful creatures fill your houses. You who fled your homes no longer multiply your days upon the sand. Yea, you who have forsaken our ways, you will die in a fouled nest if you continue on this path. But if you heed my warning, the Lord shall lead you through a land of pits into the Mountains of God. Yea, Shai-Hulud shall lead you.”\nSoft moans arose from the crowd. The Preacher paused, swinging his eyeless sockets from side to side at the sound. Then he raised his arms, spreading them wide, called out:\n“O God, my flesh longeth for Thy way in a dry and thirsty land!”\nAn old woman in front of The Preacher, an obvious refugee by the patched and worn look of her garments, held up her hands to him, pleaded: “Help us, Muad’Dib. Help us!”\nIn a sudden fearful constriction of her breast, Alia asked herself if that old woman really knew the truth. Alia glanced at her mother, but Jessica remained unmoving, dividing her attention between Alia’s guards, Farad’n and the view from the window. Farad’n stood rooted in fascinated attention.\nAlia glanced out the window, trying to see her Temple Priests. They were not in view and she suspected they had worked their way around below her near the Temple doors, seeking a direct route down the steps.\nThe Preacher pointed his right hand over the old woman’s head, shouted: “You are the only help remaining! You were rebellious. You brought the dry wind which does not cleanse, nor does it cool. You bear the burden of our desert, and the whirlwind cometh from that place, from that terrible land. | have been in that wilderness. Water runs upon the sand from shattered qanats. Streams cross the ground. Water has fallen from the sky in the Belt of Dune! O my friends, God has commanded me. Make straight in the desert a highway for our Lord, for | am the voice that cometh to thee from the wilderness.”\nHe pointed to the steps beneath his feet, a stiff and quivering finger. “This is no lost djedida which is no more inhabited forever! Here have we eaten the bread of heaven. And here the noise of strangers drives us from our homes! They breed for us a desolation, a land wherein no man dwelleth, nor any man pass thereby.”\nThe crowd stirred uncomfortably, refugees and town Fremen peering about, looking at the pilgrims of the Hajj who stood among them.\nHe could start a bloody riot! Alia thought. Well, let him. My Priests can grab him in the confusion.\nShe saw the five Priests then, a tight knot of yellow robes working down the steps behind The Preacher.\n“The waters which we spread upon the desert have become blood,” The Preacher said, waving his arms wide. “Blood upon our land! Behold our desert which could rejoice and blossom; it has lured the stranger and seduced him in our midst. They come for violence! Their faces are closed up as for the last wind of Kralizec! They gather the captivity of the sand. They suck up the abundance of the sand, the treasure hidden in the depths. Behold them as they go forth to their evil work. It is written: ‘And | stood upon the sand, and | saw a beast rise up out of that sand, and upon the head of that beast was the name of God!’”\nAngry mutterings arose from the crowd. Fists were raised, Shaken.\n“What is he doing?” Farad’n whispered.\n“I wish | knew,” Alia said. She put a hand to her breast, feeling the fearful excitement of this moment. The crowd would turn upon the pilgrims if he kept this up!\nBut The Preacher half turned, aimed his dead sockets toward the Temple and raised a hand to point at the high windows of Alia’s aerie. “One blasohemy remains!” he screamed. “Blasphemy! And the name of that blasphemy is Alia!”\nShocked silence gripped the plaza.\nAlia stood in unmoving consternation. She knew the mob could not see her, but she felt overcome by a sense of exposure, of vulnerability. The echoes of calming words within her skull competed with the pounding of her heart. She could only stare", " and upon the head of that beast was the name of God!’”\nAngry mutterings arose from the crowd. Fists were raised, Shaken.\n“What is he doing?” Farad’n whispered.\n“I wish | knew,” Alia said. She put a hand to her breast, feeling the fearful excitement of this moment. The crowd would turn upon the pilgrims if he kept this up!\nBut The Preacher half turned, aimed his dead sockets toward the Temple and raised a hand to point at the high windows of Alia’s aerie. “One blasohemy remains!” he screamed. “Blasphemy! And the name of that blasphemy is Alia!”\nShocked silence gripped the plaza.\nAlia stood in unmoving consternation. She knew the mob could not see her, but she felt overcome by a sense of exposure, of vulnerability. The echoes of calming words within her skull competed with the pounding of her heart. She could only stare down at that incredible tableau. The Preacher remained with a hand pointing at her windows.\nHis words had been too much for the Priests, though. They broke the silence with angry shouts, stormed down the steps, thrusting people aside. As they moved the crowd reacted, breaking like a wave upon the steps, sweeping over the first lines of onlookers, carrying The Preacher before\nthem. He stumbled blindly, separated from his young guide. Then a yellow-clad arm arose from the press of people; a crysknife was brandished in its hand. She saw the knife strike downward, bury itself in The Preacher’s chest.\nThe thunderous clang of the Temple’s giant doors being closed broke Alia from her shock. Guards obviously had closed the doors against the mob. But people already were drawing back, making an open space around a crumpled figure on the steps. An eerie quiet fell over the plaza. Alia Saw many bodies, but only this one lay by itself.\nThen a voice screeched from the mob: “Muad’Dib! They’ve killed Muad’Dib!”\n“Gods below,” Alia quavered. “Gods below.”\n“A little late for that, don’t you think?” Jessica asked.\nAlia whirled, noting the sudden startled reaction of Farad’n as he saw the rage on her face. “That was Paul they killed!” Alia screamed. “That was your son! When they confirm it, do you know what'll happen?”\nJessica stood rooted for a long moment, thinking that she had just been told something already known to her. Farad’n’s hand upon her arm shattered the moment. “My Lady,” he said, and there was such compassion in his voice that Jessica thought she might die of it right there. She looked from the cold, glaring anger on Alia’s face to the sympathetic misery on Farad’n’s features, and thought: Perhaps | did my job too well.\nThere could be no doubting Alia’s words. Jessica remembered every intonation of The Preacher's voice, hearing her own tricks in it, the long years of instruction she’d spent there upon a young man meant to be Emperor, but who now lay a shattered mound of bloody rags upon the Temple steps.\nGhafla blinded me, Jessica thought.\nAlia gestured to one of her aides, called: “Bring Ghanima now.”\nJessica forced herself into recognizing these words. Ghanima? Why Ghanima now?\nThe aide had turned toward the outer door, motioning for it to be unbarred, but before a word could be uttered the door bulged. Hinges popped. The bar snapped and the door, a thick plasteel construction meant to withstand terrible energies, toppled into the room. Guards leaped to avoid it, drawing their weapons.\nJessica and Farad’n’s bodyguards closed in around the Corrino Prince.\nBut the opening revealed only two children: Ghanima on the left, clad in her black betrothal robe, and Leto on the right, the grey slickness of a stillsuit beneath a desert- stained white robe.\nAlia stared from the fallen door to the children, found she was trembling uncontrollably.\n“The family here to greet us,” Leto said. “Grandmother.” He nodded to Jessica, shifted his attention to the Corrino Prince. “And this must be Prince Farad’n. Welcome to Arrakis, Prince.”\nGhanima’s eyes appeared empty. She held her right hand on a ceremonial crysknife at her waist, and she appeared to be trying to escape from Leto’s grip on her arm. Leto shook her arm and her whole body shook with it.\n“Behold me, family,” Leto said. “I am Ari, the Lion of the Atreides. And here—” Again he shook Ghanima’s arm with that powerful ease which set her whole body jerking. “— here is Aryeh, the Atreides Lioness. We come to set you onto Secher Nbiw, the Golden Path.”\nGhanima, absorbing the trigger words, Secher Nbiw, felt the locked-away consciousness flow into her mind. It flowed with a linear nicety, the inner awareness of her mother hovering there behind it, a guardian at a gate. And Ghanima knew in that instant that she had conquered the clamorous past. She possessed a gate through which she could peer when she needed that past. The months of self-hypnotic\nSuppression had built for her a safe place from which to manage her own flesh. She started to turn toward Leto with the need to explain this when she became aware of where she stood and with whom.\nLeto released her arm.\n“Did our plan work?” Ghanima whispered.\n“Well enough,” Leto said.\nRecovering from her shock, Alia shouted at a clump of guards on her left: “Seize them!”\nBut Leto bent, took the fallen door with one hand, skidded it across the room into the guards. Two were pinned against the wall. The others fell back in terror. That door weighed half a metric ton and this child had thrown it.\nAlia, growing aware that the corridor beyond the doorway contained fallen guards, realized that Leto must have dealt with them, that this child had shattered her impregnable door.\nJessica, too, had seen the bodies, seen the awesome power in Leto and had made similar assumptions, but Ghanima’s words touched a core of Bene Gesserit discipline which forced Jessica to maintain her composure. This grandchild spoke of a plan.\n“What plan?” Jessica asked.\n“The Golden Path, our Imperial plan for our Imperium,” Leto said. He nodded to Farad’n. “Don’t think harshly of me, cousin. | act for you as well. Alia hoped to have Ghanima Slay you. I’d rather you lived out your life in some degree of happiness.”\nAlia screamed at her guards cowering in the passage: “I command you to seize them!”\nBut the guards refused to enter the room.\n“Wait for me here, sister,” Leto said. “I have a disagreeable task to perform.” He moved across the room toward Alia.\nShe backed away from him into a corner, crouched and drew her knife. The green jewels of its handle flashed in the\nlight from the window.\nLeto merely continued his advance, hands empty, but spread and ready.\nAlia lunged with the knife.\nLeto leaped almost to the ceiling, struck with his left foot. It caught Alia’s head a glancing blow and sent her sprawling with a bloody mark on her forehead. She lost her grip on the knife and it skidded across the floor. Alia scrambled after the knife, but found Leto standing in front of her.\nAlia hesitated, called up everything she knew of Bene Gesserit training. She came off the floor, body loose and poised.\nOnce more Leto advanced upon her.\nAlia feinted to the left but her right shoulder came up and her right foot shot out in a toe-pointing kick which could disembowel a man if it struck precisely.\nLeto caught the blow on his arm, grabbed the foot, and picked her up by it, swinging her around his head. The speed with which he swung her sent a flapping, hissing sound through the room as her robe beat against her body.\nThe others ducked away.\nAlia screamed and screamed, but still she continued to swing around and around and around. Presently she fell silent.\nSlowly Leto reduced the speed of her whirling, dropped her gently to the floor. She lay in a panting bundle.\nLeto bent over her. “I could’ve thrown you through a wall,” he said. “Perhaps that would’ve been best, but we’re now at the center of the struggle. You deserve your chance.”\nAlia’s eyes darted wildly from side to side.\n“I have conquered those inner lives,” Leto said. “Look at Ghani. She, too, can—”\nGhanima interrupted: “Alia, | can show you—”\n“No!” The word was wrenched from Alia. Her chest heaved and voices began to pour from her mouth. They\nwere disconnected, cursing, pleading. “You see! Why didn’t you listen?” And again: “Why’re you doing this? What’s happening?” And another voice: “Stop them! Make them\nstop!” Jessica covered her eyes, felt Farad’n’s hand steady her. Still Alia raved: “lIl kill you!” Hideous curses erupted from her. “l'Il drink your blood!” The sounds of many languages\nbegan to pour from her, all jumbled and confused.\nThe huddled guards in the outer passage made the sign of the worm, then held clenched fists beside their ears. She was possessed!\nLeto stood, shaking his head. He stepped to the window and with three swift blows shattered the supposedly unbreakable crystal-reinforced glass from its frame.\nA sly look came over Alia’s face. Jessica heard something like her own voice come from that twisting mouth, a parody of Bene Gesserit control. “All of you! Stay where you are!”\nJessica, lowering her hands, found them damp with tears.\nAlia rolled to her knees, lurched to her feet.\n“Don’t you know who | am?” she demanded. It was her old voice, the sweet and lilting voice of the youthful Alia who was no more. “Why’re you all looking at me that way?” She turned pleading eyes to Jessica. “Mother, make them stop it.”\nJessica could only shake her head from side to side, consumed by ultimate horror. All of the old Bene Gesserit warnings were true. She looked at Leto and Ghani standing side by side near Alia. What did those warnings mean for these poor twins?\n“Grandmother,” Leto said, and there was pleading in his voice. “Must we have a Trial of Possession?”\n“Who are you to speak of trial?” Alia asked, and her voice was that of a querulous man, an autocratic and sensual man far gone in self-indulgence.\nBoth Leto and Ghanima recognized the voice. The Old Baron Harkonnen. Ghanima heard the same voice begin to\necho in her own head, but the inner gate closed and she sensed her mother standing there.\nJessica remained silent.\n“Then the decision is mine,” Leto said. “And the choice is yours, Alia. Trial of Possession, or...” He nodded toward the open window.\n“Who’re you to give me a choice?” Alia demanded, and it was still the voice of the Old Baron.\n“Demon!” Ghanima screamed. “Let her make her own choice!”\n“Mother,” Alia pleaded in her little-girl tones. “Mother, what’re they", " in his voice. “Must we have a Trial of Possession?”\n“Who are you to speak of trial?” Alia asked, and her voice was that of a querulous man, an autocratic and sensual man far gone in self-indulgence.\nBoth Leto and Ghanima recognized the voice. The Old Baron Harkonnen. Ghanima heard the same voice begin to\necho in her own head, but the inner gate closed and she sensed her mother standing there.\nJessica remained silent.\n“Then the decision is mine,” Leto said. “And the choice is yours, Alia. Trial of Possession, or...” He nodded toward the open window.\n“Who’re you to give me a choice?” Alia demanded, and it was still the voice of the Old Baron.\n“Demon!” Ghanima screamed. “Let her make her own choice!”\n“Mother,” Alia pleaded in her little-girl tones. “Mother, what’re they doing? What do you want me to do? Help me.”\n“Help yourself,” Leto ordered and, for just an instant, he saw the shattered presence of his aunt in her eyes, a glaring hopelessness which peered out at him and was gone. But her body moved, a sticklike, thrusting walk. She wavered, stumbled, veered from her path but returned to it, nearer and nearer the open window.\nNow the voice of the Old Baron raged from her lips: “Stop! Stop it, | say! | command you! Stop it! Feel this!” Alia clutched her head, stumbled closer to the window. She had the sill against her thighs then, but the voice still raved. “Don’t do this! Stop it and l'Il help you. | have a plan. Listen to me. Stop it, | say. Wait!” But Alia pulled her hands away from her head, clutched the broken casement. In one jerking motion, she pulled herself over the sill and was gone. Not even a screech came from her as she fell.\nIn the room they heard the crowd shout, the sodden thump as Alia struck the steps far below.\nLeto looked at Jessica. “We told you to pity her.”\nJessica turned and buried her face in Farad’n’s tunic.\nThe assumption that a whole system can be made to work better through an assault on its conscious elements betrays a dangerous ignorance. This has often been the ignorant approach of those who call themselves scientists and technologists.\n—THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD BY HARQ AL-ADA\nll H e runs at night, cousin,” Ghanima said. “He runs. Have you seen him run?”\n“No,” Farad’n said.\nHe waited with Ghanima outside the small audience hall of the Keep where Leto had called them to attend. Tyekanik stood at one side, uncomfortable with the Lady Jessica, who appeared withdrawn, as though her mind lived in another place. It was hardly an hour past the morning meal, but already many things had been set moving—a summons to the Guild, messages to CHOAM and the Landsraad.\nFarad’n found it difficult to understand these Atreides. The Lady Jessica had warned him, but still the reality of them puzzled him. They still talked of the betrothal, although most political reasons for it seemed to have dissolved. Leto would assume the throne; there appeared little doubt of that. His odd //ving skin would have to be removed, of course... but, intime...\n“He runs to tire himself,” Ghanima said. “He’s Kralizec embodied. No wind ever ran as he runs. He’s a blur atop the dunes. I’ve seen him. He runs and runs. And when he has exhausted himself at last, he returns and rests his head in my lap. ‘Ask our mother within to find a way for me to die,’ he pleads.”\nFarad’n stared at her. In the week since the riot in the plaza, the Keep had moved to strange rhythms, mysterious comings and goings; stories of bitter fighting beyond the Shield Wall came to him through Tyekanik, whose military advice had been asked.\n“| don’t understand you,” Farad’n said. “Find a way for him to die?”\n“He asked me to prepare you,” Ghanima said. Not for the first time, she was struck by the curious innocence of this Corrino Prince. Was that Jessica’s doing, or something born in him?\n“For what?”\n“He’s no longer human,” Ghanima said. “Yesterday you asked when he was going to remove the //ving skin? Never. It’s part of him now and he’s part of it. Leto estimates he has perhaps four thousand years before metamorphosis destroys him.”\nFarad’n tried to swallow in a dry throat.\n“You see why he runs?” Ghanima asked.\n“But if he’ll live so long and be so—”\n“Because the memory of being human is so rich in him. Think of all those lives, cousin. No. You can’t imagine what that is because you’ve no experience of it. But | know. | can imagine his pain. He gives more than anyone ever gave before. Our father walked into the desert trying to escape it. Alia became Abomination in fear of it. Our grandmother has only the blurred infancy of this condition, yet must use every Bene Gesserit wile to live with it—which is what Reverend Mother training amounts to anyway. But Leto! He’s all alone, never to be duplicated.”\nFarad’n felt stunned by her words. Emperor for four thousand years?\n“Jessica knows,” Ghanima said, looking across at her grandmother. “He told her last night. He called himself the first truly long-range planner in human history.”\n“What... does he plan?”\n“The Golden Path. He'll explain it to you later.”\n“And he has a role for me in this... plan?”\n“As my mate,” Ghanima said. “He’s taking over the Sisterhood’s breeding program. I’m sure my grandmother told you about the Bene Gesserit dream for a male Reverend with extraordinary powers. He’s—”\n“You mean we're just to be—”\n“Not just.” She took his arm, squeezed it with a warm familiarity. “He'll have many very responsible tasks for both of us. When we're not producing children, that is.”\n“Well, you're a little young yet,” Farad’n said, disengaging his arm.\n“Don’t ever make that mistake again,” she said. There was ice in her tone.\nJessica came up to them with Tyekanik.\n“Tyek tells me the fighting has spread off-planet,” Jessica said. “The Central Temple on Biarek is under siege.”\nFarad’n thought her oddly calm in this statement. He’d reviewed the reports with Tyekanik during the night. A wildfire of rebellion was spreading through the Empire. It would be put down, of course, but Leto would have a sorry Empire to restore.\n“Here’s Stilgar now,” Ghanima said. “They’ve been waiting for him.” And once more she took Farad’n’s arm.\nThe old Fremen Naib had entered by the far door escorted by two former Death Commando companions from the desert days. All were dressed in formal black robes with white piping and yellow headbands for mourning. They approached with steady strides, but Stilgar kept his attention on Jessica. He stopped in front of her, nodded warily.\n“You still worry about the death of Duncan Idaho,” Jessica said. She didn’t like this caution in her old friend.\n“Reverend Mother,” he said.\nSo it’s going to be that way! Jessica thought. A// formal and according to the Fremen code, with blood difficult to\nexpunge.\nShe said: “By our view, you but played a part which Duncan assigned you. Not the first time a man has given his life for the Atreides. Why do they do it, Stil? You’ve been ready for it more than once. Why? Is it that you know how much the Atreides give in return?”\n“I’m happy you seek no excuse for revenge,” he said. “But there are matters | must discuss with your grandson. These matters may separate us from you forever.”\n“You mean Tabr will not pay him homage?” Ghanima asked.\n“I mean | reserve my judgment.” He looked coldly at Ghanima. “I don’t like what my Fremen have become,” he growled. “We will go back to the old ways. Without you if necessary.”\n“For a time, perhaps,” Ghanima said. “But the desert is dying, Stil. What’ll you do when there are no more worms, no more desert?”\n“| don’t believe it!”\n“Within one hundred years,” Ghanima said, “there’ll be fewer than fifty worms, and those will be sick ones kept in a carefully managed reservation. Their spice will be for the Spacing Guild only, and the price...” She shook her head. “I’ve seen Leto’s figures. He’s been all over the planet. He knows.”\n“Is this another trick to keep the Fremen as your vassals?”\n“When were you ever my vassal?” Ghanima asked.\nStilgar scowled. No matter what he said or did, these twins always made it his fault!\n“Last night he told me about this Golden Path,” Stilgar blurted. “I don’t like it!”\n“That’s odd,” Ghanima said, glancing at her grandmother. “Most of the Empire will welcome it.”\n“Destruction of us all,” Stilgar muttered.\n“But everyone longs for the Golden Age,” Ghanima said. “Isn't that so, grandmother?”\n“Everyone,” Jessica agreed.\n“They long for the Pharaonic Empire which Leto will give them,” Ghanima said. “They long for a rich peace with abundant harvests, plentiful trade, a leveling of all except the Golden Ruler.”\n“It'll be the death of the Fremen!” Stilgar protested.\n“How can you say that? Will we not need soldiers and brave men to remove the occasional dissatisfaction? Why, Stil, you and Tyek’s brave companions will be hard pressed to do the job.”\nStilgar looked at the Sardaukar officer and a strange light of understanding passed between them.\n“And Leto will control the spice,” Jessica reminded them.\n“He'll control it absolutely,” Ghanima said.\nFarad’n, listening with the new awareness which Jessica had taught him, heard a set piece, a prepared performance between Ghanima and her grandmother.\n“Peace will endure and endure and endure,” Ghanima said. “Memory of war will all but vanish. Leto will lead humankind through that garden for at least four thousand years.”\nTyekanik glanced questioningly at Farad’n, cleared his throat.\n“Yes, Tyvek?” Farad’n said.\n“I'd speak privately with you, My Prince.”\nFarad’n smiled, knowing the question in Tyekanik’s military mind, knowing that at least two others present also recognized this question. “lII not sell the Sardaukar,” Farad’n said.\n“No need,” Ghanima said.\n“Do you listen to this child?” Tyekanik demanded. He was outraged. The old Naib there understood the problems being raised by all of this plotting, but nobody else knew a damned thing about the situation!\nGhanima smiled grimly, said: “Tell him, Farad’n.”\nFarad’n sighed. It was easy to forget the strangeness of this child who was not a child. He could imagine a lifetime married to her, the hidden reservations on every intimacy. It was not a totally pleasant prospect, but he was beginning to recognize its inevitability.
