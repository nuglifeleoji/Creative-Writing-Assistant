。我已经给省委写了信，想请一段假，到省医院去看看病。现在既然你已经到职了，并且又是地委排在第一位的副书记，那么地区的工作你就先全面管上吧……以前我对你的工作安排有些不恰当，希望你能谅解。今后我们一定要紧密团结，争取使黄原的工作有个大的起色……”田福军说：“苗书记，你不必再提过去的事了。在任何时候，个人都应该服从组织，这是党的原则……我现在担心的是，我刚到，你就要走，这副担子恐怕我担当不好，是不是先请正文主持一段……” \n　　“那还是你主持嘛！也没什么，地委和行署你都工作过，情况也熟悉，你就放手干吧！即使是重大决定，只要常委会通过了，也就不必再给我打招呼；我想集中一段时间，好好把病看一下……” \n　　这时护士进来要给老苗打针，田福军只好告退了。 \n　　田福军在地区医院看罢苗书记的当天晚上，行署副专员冯世宽到宿舍看他来了。这两个人的关系我们已经知道。过去他们在原西县工作的时候，曾经发生过一连串的冲突。富于戏剧性的是，他们不仅又要在一个锅里搅稠稀，而且两个人的地位发生了变化；以前是冯世宽领导田福军；现在是田福军领导冯世宽。世事苍桑啊……由于种种原因，现在这两个人见面后，都有点不太自然。 \n　　田福军把冯世宽让在沙发里，赶忙给他斟好了一杯茶，并且先打破尴尬，主动说：“世宽，你过去是我的老领导，现在咱们又要一块共事了，你可要好好帮助我啊！以前咱们在原西县有过些碰磕，但大部分是为了工作，希望你不要计较。就是在今后工作中，一块也免不了有些碰磕。但只要是为了工作，我想我们都是能相互谅解的。现在我们可要齐心协力呀！我们的责任可是比过去更重大、更艰难了。你已在行署搞过一段工作，我有失误之处，你得及时提醒我……”冯世宽面有惭色地说：“过去在原西，责任主要在我。我这人比较主观，看问题也很片面，检讨起来，在那里工作时犯了不少错误。现在看来，你当时的很多意见都是对的。如今你成了我的领导，请相信我会尊重你的。你对我也不必客气。我争取当好你的助手！” \n　　田福军和冯世宽谈了很长时间，直到呼正文和地区其他一些领导来拜访，世宽才告辞了。他两个人都没想到。这次谈话结果如此令人满意。社会在变化，生活在变化，人也在变化；没有什么是一成不变的，包括人的关系。 \n　　对于田福军担任专员职务，从最初的反响来看，黄原地区的大部分干部还是满意的。许多人熟悉他，知道他是一个正派和有能力的干部。另外，从资历方面说（这一点在目前仍然很重要），他\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
