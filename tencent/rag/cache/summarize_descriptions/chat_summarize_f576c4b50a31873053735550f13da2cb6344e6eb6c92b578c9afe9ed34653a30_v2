Created to serve their purposes—often at the behest of Leto II, the God Emperor—he is one of many Duncan Idaho gholas produced over time, with the Tleilaxu capable of supplying additional clones if needed. While designed to obey, Duncan exhibits independence, frequently rejecting Tleilaxu control and asserting his own agency.  \n\nThe Tleilaxu implanted submerged memories of his past lives within him, along with enhancements such as mentat abilities and resistance to Bene Gesserit powers. However, these modifications come with inner conflict, as his restored memories and implanted compulsions create psychological tension. The Bene Gesserit suspect hidden tampering in his cells or psyche, though he is confirmed to be untainted by direct manipulation.  \n\nDuncan’s gholas have served various roles, including as part of Leto’s Royal Guard—despite violating genetic laws—and even attempting to assassinate the God Emperor, suggesting possible Tleilaxu subterfuge. The current iteration may differ from predecessors due to undisclosed modifications. Ultimately, while the Tleilaxu resurrect and manipulate Duncan Idaho, his defiance and individuality complicate their designs, making him a figure of both utility and unpredictability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251956, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 680, "total_tokens": 976, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 552}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
