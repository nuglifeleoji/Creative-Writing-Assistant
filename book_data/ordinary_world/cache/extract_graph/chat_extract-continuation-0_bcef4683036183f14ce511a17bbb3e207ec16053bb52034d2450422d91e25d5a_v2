\n　　第二天凌晨，乔伯年指示回省城组织支援的吴斌，很快把这消息告诉福军同志。于是，吴斌坐直升飞机返回省城后，就在飞机场向田福军打了那个如同五雷轰顶般的电话…… \n                  第32章\n　　雨唰唰地下着。大牙湾煤矿笼罩在一片水雾之中。地面上很少有人活动。就连矿部大楼前那个平时很热闹的小广场周围，也变得冷冷清清；只有几个从乡下来的零星小贩，拿着一点土特产，躲在职工食堂的屋檐下，筒着手，也不吃喝，听天由命地等待着买主。 \n　　各种机器所发出的声音，在雨中听起来格外清脆而响亮。 \n　　到处都是淙淙的流水声，水流都象泥浆一般又稠又黑。 \n　　黑水河涨宽了。河上那棵根梢分别倒在两岸的柳树，躯干已全被黑水淹没，只露出一些嫩枝绿叶在水面上摇曳。这座有生命的“桥”已不再起作用；人们要过河到对岸，得绕着走上游的石拱桥。 \n　　连日的大雨一扫长期积下的煤尘污垢，使得整个矿区变得清爽了许多。主井下面小山一样的大煤堆，被雨水洗得油黑发亮，通过矿区的铁轨蒙上了一层水珠，明晃晃地失去了那种有色金属的质感。铁道两旁青草的鲜绿和远山云缠雾绕地混沌，都叫人不由生出一缕愁情和伤感来。从山坡黑户区低短的窝棚中，不时发出男人们粗野的哄笑和吆五喝六的猜拳声…… \n　　从井下上来的矿工，吃完饭就在雨声均匀的催眠曲中倒头就大睡。即是无雨的日子，劳累过度的人们上井后主要的愿望也就是睡觉。 \n　　天气的好坏不会影响井下的生产。那里的一切都一如既往地进行着。井下的矿工通常难以想象地面上阴雨日晴的变化。只有当他们升上地面，泡过热水澡，穿着干燥清爽的衣服走出区队办公楼的大门，才使自己切实地置身于地面上的生活中。 \n　　煤矿工人并不喜欢阴雨天气，因为井下常年四季都潮湿阴凉，到处滴嗒着水；他们希望上井后看见灿烂的太阳照耀着一个明亮温暖的世界——没有什么人比他们更能感到太阳的亲切和可爱了。 \n　　是的，倒霉的阴雨天气使得矿区这么冷冷清清！这么死气沉沉！人们除了吃饭就是睡觉。睡！不睡再干啥？孙少平倒在自己的床铺上，却怎么也睡不着。
