This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must\ndepend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.”\nWhere is my population now when I need it most? Kynes thought. He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a finger’s width toward the nearest hawk. It hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.\n“Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,” his father said. “A planet’s life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric. Vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate. As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become controlling influences in their own right—and we will have to deal with them, too. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the energy surface—only three per cent—to tip the entire structure over into our self-sustaining system.”\nWhy aren’t you helping me? Kynes wondered. Always the same: when I need you most, you fail me. He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his father’s voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer his demand.\nKynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time while its companions waited in mock indifference. The hawk stopped only a hop away from his hand.\nA profound clarity filled Kynes’ mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential for Arrakis that his father had never seen. The possibilities along that different path flooded through him.\n“No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,” his father said.\nReading my mind! Kynes thought. Wel/.../et him.\nThe messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thought. Nothing can stop them. If the Duke’s son is alive they'll find him and protect him as | have commanded. They may discard the woman, his mother, but they'll save the boy.\nThe hawk took one hop that brought it within Slashing distance of his hand. It tipped its head to examine the supine flesh. Abruptly, it straightened, stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and banked away overhead with its companions behind it.\nThey’ve come! Kynes thought. My Fremen have found me!\nThen he heard the sand rumbling.\nEvery Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous “blow” with a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.\nThe hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. They knew what was happening. Any desert creature would know.\nAnd I am a desert creature, Kynes thought. You see me, Father? I am a desert creature.\nHe felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf him, dragging him down into cool darkness. For a moment, the sensation of coolness and the moisture were blessed relief. Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.\nEven the hawks could appreciate these facts.\nProphecy and prescience—How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered question? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the “wave form” (as Muad’Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond- cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?\n—FROM “PRIVATE REFLECTIONS ON MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad G et their water,” the man calling out of the\nnight had said. And Paul fought down his fear, glanced at his mother. His trained eyes saw her readiness for battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.\n“It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand,” the voice above them said.\nThat’s the one who spoke to us first, Jessica thought. There are at least two of them—one to our right and one on our left.\n“Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas lele pal hrobas!”\nIt was the man to their right calling out across the basin.\nTo Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training, Jessica recognized the\nspeech. It was Chakobsa, one of the ancient hunting languages, and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the strangers they sought.\nIn the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoopwheel face of the second moon— faintly ivory blue—rolled over the rocks across the basin, bright and peering.\nScrambling sounds came from the rocks—above and to both sides...dark motions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through the shadows.\nA whole troop! Paul thought with a sudden pang.\nA tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his hood.\n“What have we here—jinn or human?” he asked.\nWhen Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, She allowed herself a faint hope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night.\n“Human, | warrant,” the man said.\nJessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the man’s robe. She permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no shields.\n“Do you also speak?” the man asked.\nJessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and voice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and weaknesses.\n“Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?” she demanded.\nThe burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow relaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.\nPaul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each of them a clearer arena of action.\nThe hooded head turned at Paul’s movement, opening a wedge of face to moonlight. Jessica saw a Sharp nose, one glinting eye—dark, so dark the eye, without any white in it—a heavy brown and upturned mustache.\n“A likely cub,” the man said. “If you’re fugitives from the Harkonnens, it may be you’re welcome among us. What is it, boy?”\nThe possibilities flashed through Paul’s mind: A trick? A fact? Immediate decision was needed.\n“Why should you welcome fugitives?” he demanded.\n“A child who thinks and speaks like a man,” the tall man said. “Well, now, to answer your question, my young wali, | am one who does not pay the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why | might welcome a fugitive.”\nHe knows who we are, Paul thought. There’s concealment in his voice.\n“lam Stilgar, the Fremen,” the tall man said. “Does that speed your tongue, boy?”\nIt is the same voice, Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.\n“I know you, Stilgar,” Paul said. “I was with my father in Council when you came for the water of\nyour friend. You took away with you my father’s man, Duncan Idaho—an exchange of friends.”\n“And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,” Stilgar said.\nJessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for attack.\nThe voice from the rocks above them called: “We waste time here, Stil.”\n“This is the Duke’s son,” Stilgar barked. “He’s certainly the one Liet told us to seek.”\n“But...a child, Stil.”\n“The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper,” Stilgar said. “That was a brave crossing he made in the path of sha/-hulud.”\nAnd Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed sentence?\n“We haven't time for the test,” the voice above them protested.\n“Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,” Stilgar said.\nHe’s looking for an omen! Jessica thought.\n“But the woman,” the voice above them said.\nJessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice.\n“Yes, the woman,” Stilgar said. “And her water.”\n“You know the law,” said the voice from the rocks. “Ones who cannot live with the desert—”\n“Be quiet,” Stilgar said. “Times change.”\n“Did Liet command this?” asked the voice from the rocks.\n“You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis,” Stilgar said. “Why do you press me?”\nAnd Jessica thought: Cielago! The clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant bat, a small flying mammal. Voice of the cielago: they had received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself.\n“I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar,” said the voice above them.\n“My duty is the strength of the tribe,” Stilgar said. “That is my only duty. | need no one to remind me of it. This child-man interests me. He is full-fleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the father sun. He has not the eyes of the ibad. Yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of the pans. Nor did his father. How can this be?”\n“We cannot stay out here all night arguing,” said the voice from the rocks. “If a patrol—”\n“I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet,” Stilgar said.\nThe man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their left.\n“The voice of the cielago suggested there’d be value to us in saving you two,” Stilgar said. “I can see possibility in this strong boy-man: he is young and can learn. But what of yourself, woman?” He stared at Jessica.\n| have his voice and pattern registered now, Jessica thought. / could control him with a word, but he’s a strong man...worth much more to us\nunblunted and with full freedom of action. We shall see.\n“I am the mother of this boy,” Jessica said. “In part, his strength which you admire is the product of my training.”\n“The strength of a woman can be boundless,” Stilgar said. “Certain it is in a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?”\nFor the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered truthfully, “No.”\n“Are you trained in the ways of the desert?”\n“No, but many consider my training valuable.”\n“We make our own judgments on value,” Stilgar said.\n“Every man has the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b49f6ac4a0d3b49aaea275b13d5858e8db2746e9b978c74750a08185e127ac9b_v2"}
