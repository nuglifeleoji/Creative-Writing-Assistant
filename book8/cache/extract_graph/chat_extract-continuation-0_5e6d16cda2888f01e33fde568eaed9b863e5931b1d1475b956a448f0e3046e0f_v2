蓝轩宇踩着轻快的脚步下了校车，一边走着，双手还比划着金龙惊天的动作。越是练习，他越是觉得，这一式奥妙无穷。不但本身威力大，更重要的是，还能对自己的身体有所提升。\n\n    每次练完虽然都有些精疲力竭，可第二天却总能生龙活虎，甚至自己都能感觉到自己的进步似的。\n\n    家门前，按动密码，那是妈妈的生日。\n\n    “我回来啦！”蓝轩宇叫了一声，然后就兴冲冲的跑向娜娜的房间。\n\n    娜娜老师身上，有种让他特别喜欢的味道，总是忍不住会和她亲近。\n\n    “娜娜老师，咦，不在呀！”蓝轩宇疑惑的看了一眼，娜娜的房间很干净，一切都整齐的像是没人住过。\n\n    他赶忙又跑去修炼室和卫生间，还是没人。家里空空如也。\n\n    娜娜老师这是出去了吗？\n\n    就在这时，一声轻微的嗡鸣突然响起，一道光影突然投射在客厅之中，正是娜娜的影像。\n\n    “轩宇。你回来了就会触动我留下的这一道精神烙印。老师走了。”\n\n    光影中的娜娜，脸上带着温和与不舍，抬了抬手，似乎像是要触摸他的面庞，“老师因为有些事情必须要离开了。本想和你当面告别，可又怕别离的不舍让我无法下定决心。”\n\n    “自从第一次见到你的时候，老师就特别喜欢你，所以我选择了留下来，希望能够陪伴着你成长。可是，美好的时光总是短暂的。但这段回忆一直都会伴随着老师，这一次，老师绝不会忘记。”\n\n    “你要乖乖地听爸爸、妈妈的话。按照老师教你的方法修炼。老师留给你一个魂导通讯号码，这个号码因为是要跨星球的，可能联系起来会非常昂贵。但是，等你的魂力即将突破二十级的时候，无论如何都要联系老师，那时候，老师一定会回来看你，无论是什么情况。所以，你要先努力的修炼到二十级哦。”\n\n
