Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you.”\nIt reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?\nPaul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: “Think of all these special- application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled\nsophistication. Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected.”\nHesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: “Muad’Dib: The Mouse,” and noted that the tail pointed north.\nPaul stared into the tent’s darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his mother revealed by the manual’s glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my father’s wish, he thought. / must give her his message now while she has time for grief. Grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself Shocked by precise logic.\n“Mother,” he said.\n“Yes?”\nShe heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the sound. Never had she heard such harsh control.\n“My father is dead,” he said.\nShe searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact—the Bene Gesserit way of assessing data—and it came to her: the sensation of terrifying loss.\nJessica nodded, unable to speak.\n“My father charged me once,” Paul said, “to give you a message if anything happened to him. He feared you might believe he distrusted you.”\nThat useless suspicion, she thought.\n“He wanted you to know he never suspected you,” Paul said, and explained the deception, adding: “He wanted you to know he always trusted you\ncompletely, always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regret—that he never made you his Duchess.”\nShe brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste of the body’s water! But she knew this thought for what it was—the attempt to retreat from grief into anger. Leto, my Leto, she thought. What terrible things we do to those we love! With a violent motion, she extinguished the little manual’s glowtab.\nSobs shook her.\nPaul heard his mother’s grief and felt the emptiness within himself. / have no grief, he thought. Why? Why? He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw.\n“A time to get and time to lose,” Jessica thought, quoting to herself from the O.C. Bible. “A time to keep and a time to cast away, a time for love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace.”\nPaul’s mind had gone on in its chilling precision. He saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery—as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.\nAbruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Paul’s mind climbed another notch in awareness. He felt himself clinging to this new level, clutching ata precarious hold and peering about. It was as though\nhe existed within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions...yet this only approximated the sensation.\nHe remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.\nHe saw people.\nHe felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.\nHe knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of innumerable unexplored crannies. There was time to probe and test and taste, but no time to shape.\nThe thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote future—from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his own death in countless ways. He saw new planets, new cultures.\nPeople.\nPeople.\nHe saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.\nEven the Guildsmen.\nAnd he thought: The Guild—there’d be a way for us, my strangeness accepted as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the now-necessary spice.\nBut the idea of living out his life in the mind- groping-ahead-through-possible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him. It was a way, though. And in meeting the possible future that\ncontained Guildsmen he recognized his own strangeness.\n| have another kind of sight. | see another kind of terrain: the available paths.\nThe awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm—so many places on that other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.\nAs swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.\nYet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a terrifying way. He stared around him.\nNight still covered the stilltent within its rock- enclosed hideaway. His mother’s grief could still be heard.\nHis own lack of grief could still be felt...that hollow place somewhere separated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace—dealing with data, evaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.\nAnd now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had encompassed. But this made the empty place within him no easier to bear. He felt that something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him. It went on about its business no matter what he wanted. It recorded minuscule shadings of difference around him—a slight change in moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across their stilltent roof, the\nsolemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of sky he could see out the tent’s transparent end.\nThe emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in motion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the start of it—the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible at a critical moment...and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he could look ahead—the most terrifying direction—to see where it all pointed.\nl'm a monster! he thought. A freak!\n“No,” he said. Then: “No. No! NO!”\nHe found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists. (The implacable part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into computation.)\n“Paul!”\nHis mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering at him. “Paul, what’s wrong?”\n“You!” he said.\n“l'm here, Paul,” she said. “It’s all right.”\n“What have you done to me?” he demanded.\nIn a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: “I gave birth to you.”\nIt was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in the new way by his onflowing\nmind, the clues added to other data, and a final- summation answer put forward.)\n“Let go of me,” he said.\nShe heard the tron in his voice, obeyed. “Do you want to tell me what’s wrong, Paul?”\n“Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?” he asked.\nThere’s no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: “I hoped the thing any parent hopes—that you’d be...superior, different.”\n“Different?”\nShe heard the bitterness in his tone, said: “Paul, |\n”\n“You didn’t want a son!” he said. “You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You wanted a male Bene Gesserit!”\nShe recoiled from his bitterness. “But Paul....”\n“Did you ever consult my father in this?”\nShe spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: “Whatever you are, Paul, the heredity is as much your father as me.”\n“But not the training,” he said. “Not the things that...awakened...the sleeper.”\n“Sleeper?”\n“It’s here.” He put a hand to his head and then to his breast. “In me. It goes on and on and on and on and—”\n“Paul!”\nShe had heard the hysteria edging his voice.\n“Listen to me,” he said. “You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my dreams: You listen in her\nplace now. I’ve just had a waking dream. Do you know why?”\n“You must calm yourself,” she said. “If there’s—”\n“The spice,” he said. “It’s in everything here—the air, the soil, the food, the geriatric spice. It’s like the Truthsayer drug. It’s a poison!”\nShe stiffened.\nHis voice lowered and he repeated: “A poison—so subtle, so insidious...so irreversible. It won’t even kill you unless you stop taking it. We can’t leave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us.”\nThe terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.\n“You and the spice,” Paul said. “The spice changes anyone who gets this much of it, but thanks to you, | could bring the change to consciousness. | don’t get to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out. | can see it.”\n“Paul, you—”\n“I see it!” he repeated.\nShe heard madness in his voice, didn’t know what to do.\nBut he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: “We’re trapped here.”\nWe're trapped here, she agreed.\nAnd she accepted the truth of his words. No pressure of the Bene Gesserit, no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the Spice was addictive. Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.\nSo here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell planet. The place is prepared for us, if we can\nevade the Harkonnens. And there’s no doubt of my course: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit Plan.\n“I must tell you about my waking dream,” Paul said. (Now there was fury in his voice.) “To be sure you accept what I say, l'II tell you first | know you'll bear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis.”\nJessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against the curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear. She knew her pregnancy could not show yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first faint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.\n“Only to serve,” Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto. “We exist only to serve.”\n“We'll find a home among the Fremen,” Paul said, “where your Missionaria Protectiva has bought us a bolt hole.”\nThey’ve prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself. But how can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.\nHe studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light.
