\n　　少平认出信封上是二爸的字体。他的手忍不住微微发着抖，拆开了那封信——他们家的信大概不会给他带来什么好消息。 \n　　信很简单—— \n　　少平儿： \n　　自从你离家以后，一直没有音讯，全家人都很想念你，家里有些事，需要你很快回来一下。请你收到信马上反（返）回来。 \n　　家里一切都好，不要挂念。 \n　　父亲 \n　　虽然信上没有具体说家里出了什么事，但少平心里还是有些忐忑不安。 \n　　“没什么吧？”金波观察着他的脸色。 \n　　“没什么……家里让我回去一下。” \n　　“那你什么时间走，你可以搭我父亲的邮车。”“我得收拾两天。” \n　　金波和上次一样，先不再说什么，赶紧出去做饭——他知道少平最需要的首先是好好吃一顿饭。 \n　　两个人吃完大半脸盆揪白面片后，少平就把曹书记要他落户到阳沟的事，给金波细说了一遍。 \n　　金波不假思索地说：“啊呀，这是好事！在城边上当个庄稼人，也比一辈子呆在双水村强！旁的不说，看个电影也方便！这样，你实际上就活在城市里了。” \n　　金波这么一说，少平再一次兴奋起来。 \n　　两个好朋友高兴的是，他们又要生活在同一个地方，有个什么事，互相也可以照应。谁知世事今后还会怎样变化！黄原是个大地方，只要他们有能耐，尽可以在这个天地里扬胳膊伸腿！ \n　　这样，孙少平就下了决心，准备将自己的户口迁到黄原来了。他想，过几年他闹好了，还可以把父母的户口也迁过来。世界这么大，哪里也可以活人！另外，从发展的眼光看，城边上当个农民，闹腾家业的出路也多。好，他应该当机立断，马上行动，千万不敢失去这个一生难逢的好机会！ \n　　告别金波后的当天晚上，少平就找了工头，说他家里有事，要结算工钱，不准备再上这工了。 \n　　工头看来非常遗撼失了一个好小工。结算完工钱后，工头破例把他带到厨房，让他做饭的亲戚给少平切了一碗肥猪肉片子，算是对他曾经卖命干活也表示一点犒劳。一碗猪肉下肚，少平嘴一抹，就去了阳沟。 \n　　曹书记一家人热情地接待了他。这次见面，双方已经不是当初那种主仆关系，而象是亲朋好友一般。 \n　　曹书记立刻出去为他办准迁证。书记的老婆就及时抓住机会，让少平给女儿菊英补习中学语文课。在少平开始为菊英补习功课的时候，菊英她妈推说到邻居家取东西，溜出去半天没有回来。 \n　　十八岁的菊英完全是城市姑娘的打扮。白净的脸蛋，弯弯的眉毛，一对清\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
