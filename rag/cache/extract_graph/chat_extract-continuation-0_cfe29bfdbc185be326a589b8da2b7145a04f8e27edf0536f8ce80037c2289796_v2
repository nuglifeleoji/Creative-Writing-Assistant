Trees whipped past her in the moonlight. She had entered that timeless void of the running when there was nothing else but her own movements, her own body doing what it had been conditioned to do.\nMen thought her beautiful when she ran. Siona knew this. Her long dark hair was tied tightly to keep it from whipping in the wind of her passage. She had accused Kwuteg of foolishness when he had refused to copy her style.\nWhere is Kwuteg?\nHer hair was not like Kwuteg’s. It was that deep brown which is sometimes confused with black, but is not truly black, not like Kwuteg’s at all.\nIn the way genes occasionally do, her features copied those of a long dead ancestor: gently oval and witha generous mouth, eyes of alert awareness above a small nose. Her body had grown lanky from years of running, but it sent strong sexual signals to the males around her.\nWhere is Kwuteg?\nThe wolf pack had fallen silent and this filled her with alarm. They had done that before bringing down Radi. It had been the same when they got Setuse.\nShe told herself the silence could mean other things. Kwuteg, too, was silent... and strong. The injury had not appeared to bother him too much.\nSiona began to feel pain in her chest, the gasping-to- come which she knew well from the long kilometers of training. Perspiration still poured down her body under the thin, black running garment. The kit, with its precious contents sealed against the river passage ahead, rode high on her back. She thought about the Citadel charts folded there.\nWhere does Leto hide his hoard of spice?\nIt had to be somewhere within the Citadel. It had to be. Somewhere in the charts there would be a clue. The melange-spice for which the Bene Gesserit, the Guild and all the others hungered .. . that was a prize worth this risk.\nAnd those two cryptic volumes. Kwuteg had been right in one thing. Ridulian crystal paper was heavy. But she shared Ulot’s excitement. Something important was concealed in those lines of cipher.\nOnce more the eager chase-yelps of the wolves sounded in the forest behind her.\nRun, Kwuteg! Run!\nNow, just ahead of her through the trees, she could see the wide cleared strip which bordered the Idaho River. She glimpsed moon brightness on water beyond the clearing.\nRun, Kwuteg!\nShe longed for a sound from Kwuteg, any sound. Only the two of them remained now from the eleven who had started the run. Nine had paid for this venture with their lives: Radi, Aline, Ulot, Setuse, Inineg, Onemao, Hutye, Memar and Oala.\nSiona thought their names and with each sent a silent prayer to the old gods, not to the tyrant Leto. Especially, she prayed to Shai-Hulud.\n| pray to Shai-Hulud, who lives in the sand.\nAbruptly, she was out of the forest and onto the moon- bright stretch of mowed ground along the river. Straight ahead beyond a narrow shingle of beach, the water beckoned to her. The beach was silver against the oily flow.\nA loud yell from back in the trees almost made her falter. She recognized Kwuteg’s voice above the wild wolf sounds. Kwuteg called out to her without name, an unmistakable cry with one word containing countless conversations—a message of death and life.\n“Go!”\nThe pack sounds took on a terrible commotion of frenzied yelps, but nothing more from Kwuteg. She knew then how Kwuteg was spending the last energies of his life.\nDelaying them to help me escape.\nObeying Kwuteg’s cry, she dashed to the river’s edge and plunged headfirst into the water. The river was a freezing shock after the heat of the run. It stunned her for a moment and she floundered outward, struggling to swim and regain her breath. The precious kit floated and bumped against the back of her head.\nThe Idaho River was not wide here, no more than fifty meters, a gently sweeping curve with sandy indentations fringed by roots and shelving banks of lush reeds and grass where the water refused to stay in the straight lines Leto’s engineers had designed. Siona was strengthened by the knowledge that the D-wolves had been conditioned to stop at the water. Their territorial boundaries had been drawn, the river on this side and the desert wall on the other side. Still, she swam the last few meters underwater and surfaced in the shadows of a cutbank before turning and looking back.\nThe wolf pack stood ranged along the bank, all except one which had come down to the river’s edge. It leaned forward with its forefeet almost into the flow. She heard it whine.\nSiona knew the wolf saw her. No doubt of that. D-wolves were noted for their keen eyesight. There were Gaze Hounds in the ancestry of Leto’s forest guardians and he bred the wolves for their eyesight. She wondered if this once the wolves might break through their conditioning. They were mostly sight-hunters. If that one wolf at the river’s edge should enter the water, all might follow. Siona held her breath. She felt the dragging of exhaustion. They had come almost thirty kilometers, the last half of it with the D-wolves close behind.\nThe wolf at the river’s edge whined once more then leaped back up to its companions. At some silent signal, they turned and loped back into the forest.\nSiona knew where they would go. D-wolves were allowed to eat anything they brought down in the Forbidden Forest. Everyone knew this. It was why the wolves roamed the forest—the guardians of the Sareer.\n“You'll pay for this, Leto,” she whispered. It was a low sound, her voice, very close to the quiet rustling of the water against the reeds just behind her. “You'll pay for Ulot, for Kwuteg and for all the others. You'll pay.”\nShe pushed outward gently and drifted with the current until her feet met the first shelving of a narrow beach. Slowly, her body dragged down by fatigue, she climbed from the water and paused to check that the sealed contents of her kit had remained dry. The seal was unbroken. She stared at ita moment in the moonlight, then lifted her gaze to the forest wall across the river.\nThe price we paid. Ten dear friends.\nTears glimmered in her eyes, but she had the stuff of the ancient Fremen and her tears were few. The venture across the river, directly through the forest while the wolves\npatrolled the northern boundaries, then across the Last Desert of the Sareer and over the Citadel’s ramparts—all of this already was assuming dream proportions in her mind... even the flight from the wolves which she had anticipated because it was a certainty that the guardian pack would cross the track of the invaders and be waiting... all a dream. It was the past.\n| escaped.\nShe restored the kit with its sealed packet and fastened it once more against her back.\n| have broken through your defenses, Leto.\nSiona thought then about the cryptic volumes. She felt certain that something hidden in those lines of cipher would open the way for her revenge.\n| will destroy you, Leto!\nNot We will destroy you! That was not Siona’s way. She would do it herself.\nShe turned and strode toward the orchards beyond the river's mowed border. As she walked she repeated her oath, adding to it aloud the old Fremen formula which terminated in her full name:\n“Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides it is who curses you, Leto. You will pay in full!”\nThe following is from the Hadi Benotto translation of the volumes discovered at Dar-es-Balat:\n| was born Leto Atreides II more than three thousand standard years ago, measuring from the moment when | cause these words to be printed. My father was Paul Muad’Dib. My mother was his Fremen consort, Chani. My maternal grandmother was Faroula, a noted herbalist among the Fremen. My paternal grandmother was Jessica, a product of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme in their search for a male who could share the powers of the Sisterhood’s Reverend Mothers. My maternal grandfather was Liet-Kynes, the planetologist who organized the ecological transformation of Arrakis. My paternal grandfather was The Atreides, descendant of the House of Atreus and tracing his ancestry directly back to the Greek Original.\nEnough of these begats!\nMy paternal grandfather died as many good Greeks did, attempting to kill his mortal enemy, the old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Both of them rest uncomfortably now in my ancestral memories. Even my father is not content. | have done what he feared to do and now his shade must share in the consequences.\nThe Golden Path demands it. And what is the Golden Path? you ask. It is the survival of humankind, nothing more nor less. We who have prescience, we who know the pitfalls in our human futures, this has always been our responsibility.\nSurvival.\nHow you feel about this—your petty woes and joys, even your agonies and raptures—seldom concerns us. My father\nhad this power. | have it stronger. We can peer now and again through the veils of Time.\nThis planet of Arrakis from which | direct my multigalactic Empire is no longer what it was in the days when it was known as Dune. In those days, the entire planet was a desert. Now, there is just this little remnant, my Sareer. No longer does the giant sandworm roam free, producing the spice melange. The spice! Dune was noteworthy only as the source of melange, the only source. What an extraordinary substance. No laboratory has ever been able to duplicate it. And it is the most valuable substance humankind has ever found.\nWithout melange to ignite the linear prescience of Guild Navigators, people cross the parsecs of space only ata Snail’s crawl. Without melange, the Bene Gesserit cannot endow Truthsayers or Reverend Mothers. Without the geriatric properties of melange, people live and die according to the ancient measure—no more than a hundred years or so. Now, the only spice is held in Guild and Bene Gesserit storehouses, a few small hoards among the remnants of the Great Houses, and my gigantic hoard which they all covet. How they would like to raid me! But they don’t dare. They know | would destroy it all before Surrendering it.\nNo. They come hat in hand and petition me for melange. | dole it out as a reward and hold it back as punishment. How they hate that.\nIt is my power, | tell them. It is my gift.\nWith it, | create Peace. They have had more than three thousand years of Leto’s Peace. It is an enforced tranquility which humankind knew only for the briefest periods before my ascendancy. Lest you have forgotten, study Leto’s Peace once more in these, my journals.\n| began this account in the first year of my stewardship, in the first throes of my metamorphosis when | was still mostly human, even visibly so. The sandtrout skin which | accepted\n(and my father refused) and which gave me greatly amplified strength plus virtual immunity from conventional attack and aging—that skin still covered a form recognizably human: two legs, two arms, a human face framed in the scrolled folds of the sandtrout.\nAhhh, that face! | still have\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a determined and athletic individual with Fremen heritage, known for her long dark hair and strong will.
