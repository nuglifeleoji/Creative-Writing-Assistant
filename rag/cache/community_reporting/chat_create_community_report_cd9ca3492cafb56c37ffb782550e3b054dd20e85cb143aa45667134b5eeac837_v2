Cautious and skeptical by nature, she becomes intrigued by Leto II's words, though her role in his story is complex and multifaceted. Initially, she was sent to Shuloch as punishment for allowing Leto to escape, marking her as a figure entangled in Fremen discipline and judgment.  \n\nSabiha plays a significant part in the events surrounding Leto II, both as an observer and an active participant. She is mentioned in Leto's thoughts as a \"\"delicate thread ahead,\"\" hinting at her importance in his unfolding destiny. At one point, she is shamed by Leto and subjected to an Isnad judgment, resulting in her losing her water—a severe Fremen punishment—underscoring her deep connection to the political and spiritual tensions in Shuloch and the qanat.  \n\nHer interactions with Leto reveal her as both a caretaker and a monitor. She prepares food for Bes and participates in visions tied to Leto's experiences, demonstrating her role in the daily and ritualistic life of the Fremen. Additionally, she is present during Leto's spice trance, observing his transformation with shock, further cementing her involvement in pivotal moments of his journey.  \n\nSabiha also contributes to the Fremen's strategic efforts, suggesting that Leto might have hidden in the sand using a Fremkit, showcasing her knowledge of survival tactics. Her character embodies the contradictions of Fremen society—disciplined yet vulnerable, skeptical yet drawn to Leto's enigmatic presence.

Namri is tasked with **Leto's capture, training, and potential execution**, acting under **Gurney Halleck's orders** while embodying Fremen cultural loyalty and deviousness.  \n\nNamri plays a pivotal role in **Leto's judgment**, initially considering killing him but ultimately swayed by Leto's words during a tense confrontation. He is part of the group that holds Leto captive, representing both a **threat and a test** for Leto's survival. Namri interrogates Leto, referencing **family marks and visions of Thatta**, and participates in the **spice trance process** under **Jessica's instructions**.  \n\nHis interactions with **Gurney Halleck** reveal his involvement in strategic decisions, including discussions about **Leto's safety** and **Sabiha's role**, who offended the **Jacurutu**. Namri also informs Halleck about an **incoming storm** and a **communication blackout**, highlighting his logistical awareness.  \n\nThough his actions are ambiguous—balancing loyalty to Fremen traditions with external orders—Namri remains a key figure in the **broader narrative**, shaping Leto's fate and the unfolding rebellion.
