These individuals are tasked with the unique responsibility of devising strategic plans that are based solely on their internal thoughts and insights, without disclosing their intentions to the outside world. This secrecy is a fundamental aspect of their role, allowing them to operate without external pressures or interference.\n\nIn society, the 面壁者 are viewed as a group of considerable importance, often regarded as saviors or heroes by the public. They possess immense charisma and political power, which enhances their ability to rally support and mobilize resources for their strategic initiatives. This perception of the 面壁者 as pivotal figures in times of crisis underscores their societal significance and the weight of their responsibilities.\n\nOverall, the 面壁者 embody a complex interplay of authority, secrecy, and public perception, making them crucial players in the strategic landscape, particularly in the context of the 太空军 and broader societal challenges.\",10\r\n87,联合国,\"The United Nations (联合国) is an international organization established in 1945, with the primary objectives of promoting peace, security, and cooperation among its 193 member states. It addresses a wide range of global issues and is involved in various initiatives aimed at fostering international collaboration. The organization plays a crucial role in coordinating military actions and strategies among member states, as well as overseeing significant projects such as the Wallfacer Project, which involves the management of the 面壁法案 (Wallfacer legislation) to ensure the privileges of the Wallfacers in formulating and executing their plans.\n\nThe United Nations is also engaged in discussions and negotiations regarding pressing global threats, including the Trisolaran presence, and has passed resolutions addressing critical issues, such as resolution 117, which classifies escapeism as a crime against humanity. The organization is responsible for the supervision and control of the operations of the 思想钢印 (Thought Steel Stamp) and ensures strict oversight during its use.\n\nIn times of crisis, the United Nations takes action involving legal and resource management, and it has been involved in the preparation of peace negotiations with fleets. The organization is dedicated to maintaining international peace and security, and it coordinates global affairs, including proposals for technological public ownership.\n\nThe United Nations has also been recognized for its historical significance, such as receiving a sculpture titled \"\"铸剑为犁\"\" (Turning Swords into Plowshares) from the former Soviet government. Additionally, it has conferred the title of Wallfacer upon individuals like 罗辑 (Luo Ji), who has sought to engage with the UN through video systems and has previously declined missions assigned to him.\n\nDespite its many responsibilities, the United Nations has faced criticism, including accusations of being responsible for the release of 雷迪亚兹 (Radiance). Nonetheless, it remains a pivotal entity in the management of global affairs and the continuation of human civilization, striving to enhance resource scrutiny and limitations for strategic plans through legislative revisions.\n\nIn summary, the United Nations is a multifaceted organization that plays a vital role in international diplomacy, crisis management, and the promotion of global peace and cooperation, while also navigating complex challenges and criticisms in its mission to serve humanity.\",30\r\n86,中国,\"China is a country that plays a significant role on the global stage, particularly in its support for United Nations resolutions aimed at combating escapism.

This project involves the selection of four individuals, referred to as 面壁者 (Wallfacers), who are tasked with developing complex and secretive plans to protect humanity. The essence of the project lies in the Wallfacers' ability to engage in closed personal thinking, allowing them to devise strategies without the risk of external surveillance, particularly from the advanced Trisolaran intelligence known as 智子.\n\nThe initiative is characterized by its reliance on the inner thoughts and decision-making processes of the selected Wallfacers, who must navigate significant challenges and make sacrifices in their efforts to counter the enemy. The project is not only a military strategy but also a historical reference, as highlighted by 罗辑 (Luo Ji), who discusses its implications and the burdens it places on those involved. The Wallfacer Project is portrayed as a unique mission in history, emphasizing the importance of secrecy and the innovative leadership structure it introduces.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the Wallfacer Project is depicted as a critical meeting point for discussions on defense strategies, including the development and deployment of advanced weaponry such as hydrogen bombs. It serves as a platform for the Wallfacers to share their insights and collaborate on solutions to the Trisolaran crisis. Notably, 罗辑 is identified as a key figure within this initiative, having been designated as the sole Wallfacer at one point, although he later expresses a desire to distance himself from the identity and responsibilities associated with the project.\n\nThe project also highlights the interplay between personal lives and the overarching mission, as seen in the connections between 罗辑 and 庄颜 (Zhuang Yan), which are intricately linked to the challenges posed by the Wallfacer Project. The initiative is framed as a vital effort to safeguard human existence, requiring the Wallfacers to confront not only external threats but also the moral and ethical dilemmas that arise from their roles.\n\nIn summary, the Wallfacer Project is a historic and strategic endeavor aimed at protecting humanity from the Trisolaran invasion, involving a select group of individuals who must engage in secretive and strategic thinking to devise effective countermeasures.
