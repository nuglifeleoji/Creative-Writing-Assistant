Duncan liked some of the guards and occasionally lured some of them into real play with laughter and tumbling. His prank, sneaking out to the pillbox, had hurt his friends.\nDuncan knew what it was to be punished.\nDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\nAfter Schwangyu’s lecture, Duncan ran to his chief instructor of the moment, Reverend Mother Tamalane, another of the wizened old ones with a cool and aloof manner, snowy hair above a narrow face and a leather skin. He demanded of Tamalane to know about the punishment of his guards. Tamalane fell into a surprising pensive mood, her voice like sand rasping against wood.”\n“Punishments? Well, well.”\nThey were in the small teaching room off the larger practice floor where Tamalane went each evening to prepare the next day’s lessons. It was a place of bubble and spool readers and other sophisticated means for information storage and retrieval. Duncan far preferred it to the library but he was not allowed in the teaching room unattended. It was a bright room lighted by many suspensor-buoyed glowglobes. At his intrusion, Tamalane turned away from where she laid out his lessons.\n“There’s always something of a sacrificial banquet about our major punishments,” she said. “The guards will, of course, receive major punishment.”\n“Banquet?” Duncan was puzzled.\nTamalane swung completely around in her swivel seat and looked directly into his eyes. Her steely teeth glittered in the bright lights. “History has seldom been good to those who must be punished,” she said.\nDuncan flinched at the word “history.” It was one of Tamalane’s signals. She was going to teach a lesson, another boring lesson.\n“Bene Gesserit punishments cannot be forgotten.”\nDuncan focused on Tamalane’s old mouth, sensing abruptly that she spoke out of painful personal experience. He was going to learn something interesting!\n“Our punishments carry an inescapable lesson,” Tamalane said. “It is much more than the pain.”\nDuncan sat on the floor at her feet. From this angle, Tamalane was a black-shrouded and ominous figure.\n“We do not punish with the ultimate agony,” she said. “That is reserved for a Reverend Mother’s passage through the spice.”\nDuncan nodded. Library records referred to “spice agony,” a mysterious trial that created a Reverend Mother.\n“Major punishments are painful, nonetheless,” she said. “They are also emotionally painful. Emotion evoked by punishment is always that emotion we judge to be the\npenitent’s greatest weakness, and thus we strengthen the punished.”\nHer words filled Duncan with unfocused dread. What were they doing to his guards? He could not speak but there was no need. Tamalane was not finished.\n“The punishment always ends with a dessert,” she said and she clapped her hands against her knees.\nDuncan frowned. Dessert? That was part of a banquet. How could a banquet be punishment?\n“It is not really a banquet but the idea of a banquet,” Tamalane said. One clawlike hand described a circle in the air. “The dessert comes, something totally unexpected. The penitent thinks: Ahhh, | have been forgiven at last! You understand?”\nDuncan shook his head from side to side. No, he did not understand.\n“It is the sweetness of the moment,” she said. “You have been through every course of a painful banquet and come out at the end to something you can savor. But! As you savor it, then comes the most painful moment of all, the recognition, the understanding that this is not pleasure-at- the-end. No, indeed. This is the ultimate pain of the major punishment. It locks in the Bene Gesserit lesson.”\n“But what will she do to those guards?” The words were wrenched from Duncan.\n“I cannot say what the specific elements of the individual punishments will be. | have no need to know. | can only tell you it will be different for each of them.”\nTamalane would say no more. She returned to laying out the next day’s lessons. “We will continue tomorrow,” she said, “teaching you to identify the sources of the various accents of spoken Galach.”\nNo one else, not even Teg or Patrin, would answer his questions about the punishments. Even the guards, when he saw them afterward, refused to speak of their ordeals. Some reacted curtly to his overtures and none would play with\nhim anymore. There was no forgiveness among the punished. That much was clear.\nDamn Schwangyu! Damn Schwangyu!...\nThat was where his deep hatred of her began. All of the old witches shared in his hatred. Would the new young one be the same as the old ones?\nDamn Schwangyu!\nWhen he demanded of Schwangyu: “Why did you have to punish them?” Schwangyu took some time before answering, then: “It is dangerous for you here on Gammu. There are people who wish you harm.”\nDuncan did not ask why. This was another area where his questions were never answered. Not even Teg would answer, although Teg’s very presence emphasized the fact of that danger.\nAnd Miles Teg was a Mentat who must know many answers. Duncan often saw the old man’s eyes glisten while his thoughts went far away. But there was no Mentat response to such questions as:\n“Why are we here on Gammu?”\n“Who do you guard against? Who wants to harm me?”\n“Who are my parents?”\nSilence greeted such questions or sometimes Teg would growl: “I cannot answer you.”\nThe library was useless. He had discovered this when he was only eight and his chief instructor was a failed Reverend Mother named Luran Geasa—not quite as ancient as Schwangyu but well along in years, more than a hundred, anyway.\nAt his demand, the library produced information about Gammu/Giedi Prime, about the Harkonnens and their fall, about various conflicts where Teg had commanded. None of those battles came through as very bloody; several commentators referred to Teg’s “Superb diplomacy.” But, one datum leading to another, Duncan learned about the time of the God Emperor and the taming of his people. This\nperiod commanded Duncan’s attention for weeks. He found an old map in the records and projected it on the focus wall. The commentator’s superimpositions told him that this very Keep had been a Fish Speaker Command Center abandoned during the Scattering.\nFish Speakers!\nDuncan wished then that he had lived during their time, serving as one of the rare male advisors in the female army that had worshiped the great God Emperor.\nOh, to have lived on Rakis in those days!\nTeg was surprisingly forthcoming about the God Emperor, calling him always “the Tyrant.” A library lock was opened and information about Rakis came pouring out for Duncan.\n“Will | ever see Rakis?” he asked Geasa.\n“You are being prepared to live there.”\nThe answer astonished him. Everything they taught him about that faraway planet came into new focus.\n“Why will | live there?”\n“I cannot answer that.”\nWith renewed interest, he returned to his studies of that mysterious planet and its miserable Church of Shai-hulud, the Divided God. Worms. The God Emperor had become those worms! The idea filled Duncan with awe. Perhaps here was something worthy of worship. The thought touched a chord in him. What had driven a man to accept that terrible metamorphosis?\nDuncan knew what his guards and the others in the Keep thought about Rakis and the core of priesthood there. Sneering remarks and laughter told it all. Teg said: “We'll probably never know the whole truth of it, but | tell you, lad, that’s no religion for a soldier.”\nSchwangyu capped it: “You are to learn about the Tyrant but you are not to believe in his religion. That is beneath you, contemptible.”\nIn every spare study moment, Duncan pored over whatever the library produced for him: the Holy Book of the\nDivided God, the Guard Bible, the Orange Catholic Bible and even the Apocrypha. He learned about the long defunct Bureau of the Faith and “The Pearl that IS the Sun of Understanding.”\nThe very idea of the worms fascinated him. Their size! A big one would stretch from one end of the Keep to the other. Men had ridden the pre-Tyrant worms but the Rakian priesthood forbade this now.\nHe found himself gripped by accounts from the archeological team that had found the Tyrant’s primitive no- chamber on Rakis. Dar-es-Balat, the place was called. The reports by Archeologist Hadi Benotto were marked “Suppressed by orders of the Rakian Priesthood.” The file number on the accounts from Bene Gesserit Archives was a long one and what Benotto revealed was fascinating.\n“A kernel of the God Emperor’s awareness in each worm?” he asked Geasa.\n“So it’s said. And even if true, they are not conscious, not aware. The Tyrant himself said he would enter an endless dream.”\nEach study session occasioned a special lecture and Bene Gesserit explanations of religion until finally he encountered those accounts called “The Nine Daughters of Siona” and “The Thousand Sons of Idaho.”\nConfronting Geasa, he demanded: “My name is Duncan Idaho, too. What does that mean?”\nGeasa always moved as though standing in the shadow of her failure, her long head bent forward and her watery eyes aimed at the ground. The confrontation occurred near evening in the long hall outside the practice floor. She paled at his question.\nWhen she did not answer, he demanded: “Am | descended from Duncan Idaho?”\n“You must ask Schwangyu.” Geasa sounded as though the words pained her.\nIt was a familiar response and it angered him. She meant he would be told something to shut him up, little information in the telling. Schwangyu, however, was more open than expected.\n“You carry the authentic blood of Duncan Idaho.”\n“Who are my parents?”\n“They are long dead.”\n“How did they die?”\n“I do not know. We received you as an orphan.”\n“Then why do people want to harm me?”\n“They fear what you may do.”\n“What is it | may do?”\n“Study your lessons. All will be made clear to you in time.”\nShut up and study! Another familiar answer.\nHe obeyed because he had learned to recognize when the doors were closed on him. But now his questing intelligence met other accounts of the Famine Times and the Scattering, the no-chambers and no-ships that could not be traced, not even by the most powerful prescient minds in their universe. Here, he encountered the fact that descendants of Duncan Idaho and Siona, those ancients who had served the Tyrant God Emperor, also were invisible to prophets and prescients. Not even a Guild Steersman deep in melange trance could detect such people. Siona, the accounts told him, was a true-bred Atreides and Duncan Idaho was a ghola.\nGhola?\nHe probed the library for elaborations on this peculiar word. Ghola. The library produced for him no more than bare-boned accounts: “Gholas: humans grown from a cadaver’s cells in Tleilaxu axlotl tanks.”\nAxlotl tanks?\n“A Tleilaxu device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver.”\n“Describe a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHWANGYU<|>PERSON<|>Schwangyu is a Bene Gesserit who disciplines Duncan and the guards, and is a source of Duncan's hatred due to her harsh punishments and secrecy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a young boy being trained by the Bene Gesserit, who is curious about his origins and the punishments inflicted on his friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Reverend Mother Tamalane is a Bene Gesserit instructor who teaches Duncan about punishments and the Bene Gesserit ways)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is a Mentat and Duncan's guardian who refuses to answer many of Duncan's questions about their presence on Gammu)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LURAN GEASA<|>PERSON<|>Luran Geasa is a failed Reverend Mother and one of Duncan's instructors who provides limited answers about his studies and origins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive organization that trains Duncan and enforces strict discipline and punishments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers were a female army that worshiped the God Emperor, and their command center was once located in the Keep where Duncan resides)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHURCH OF SHAI-HULUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Church of Shai-hulud is the religion of the Divided God on Rakis, centered around the worship of sandworms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKIS<|>GEO<|>Rakis is the planet where the God Emperor transformed into sandworms, and a place Duncan is being prepared to live)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is the planet where Duncan and the Bene Gesserit reside, and where Duncan faces unknown dangers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIEDI PRIME<|>GEO<|>Giedi Prime is the former name of Gammu, associated with the Harkonnens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAR-ES-BALAT<|>GEO<|>Dar-es-Balat is the location on Rakis where the Tyrant's no-chamber was discovered by archaeologists)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The Spice Agony is a trial that creates a Reverend Mother, involving intense pain and transformation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>The Scattering was a mass exodus of people following the Famine Times, and the Fish Speakers abandoned the Keep during this period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMINE TIMES<|>EVENT<|>The Famine Times were a period of hardship that preceded the Scattering)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SCHWANGYU<|>Duncan hates Schwangyu for her harsh punishments and secrecy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>TAMALANE<|>Tamalane is Duncan's instructor who teaches him about Bene Gesserit punishments<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>MILES TEG<|>Miles Teg is Duncan's guardian and a Mentat who refuses to answer many of his questions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LURAN GEASA<|>Luran Geasa is one of Duncan's instructors who provides limited answers about his studies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan is being trained by the Bene Gesserit and is subject to their discipline<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>RAKIS<|>Duncan is being prepared to live on Rakis and is fascinated by its history<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>GAMMU<|>Duncan resides on Gammu and faces unknown dangers there<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>SCHWANGYU<|>Schwangyu is a member of the Bene Gesserit who enforces their discipline<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>TAMALANE<|>Tamalane is a Reverend Mother and instructor within the Bene Gesserit<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>LURAN GEASA<|>Luran Geasa is a failed Reverend Mother associated with the Bene Gesserit<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>The Bene Gesserit's Keep was once a Fish Speaker Command Center<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAKIS<|>CHURCH OF SHAI-HULUD<|>Rakis is the center of the Church of Shai-hulud and the worship of sandworms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAKIS<|>SPICE AGONY<|>The Spice Agony is associated with the transformation and religion of Rakis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAMMU<|>GIEDI PRIME<|>Gammu was formerly known as Giedi Prime, associated with the Harkonnens<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCATTERING<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>The Fish Speakers abandoned the Keep during the Scattering<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCATTERING<|>FAMINE TIMES<|>The Scattering followed the Famine Times<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
