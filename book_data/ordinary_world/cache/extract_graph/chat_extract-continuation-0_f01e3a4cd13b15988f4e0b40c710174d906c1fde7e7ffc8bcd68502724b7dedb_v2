教授是师专的副校长，还给他们班讲授唐宋文学课。“我爷爷病了，我回原西看了一下，今天下午才返回到这里。我父母亲现在又回去了。我准备过一两天就回学校去。” \n　　风度翩翩的顾养民说着，就招呼她在一个长条木栏椅上一块坐下来。 \n　　田晓霞在中学时和顾养民不同班，但因为一块演过戏，彼此也很熟悉。前年高考时，原来的同学中就他们两个考上了。养民考进了省医学院——他爷爷是著名老中医，他报考医学院是很自然的。 \n　　“你也看文学杂志？”晓霞指了指他手中的那本期刊。“平时功课压得很重。没时间看。这几天没事，随便翻翻小说。现在文学创作很活跃，我们接触的不多。”顾养民谈吐自然，给人一种很成熟的印象。他瘦高个，脸色有点苍白，近视镜的度数看来不浅。 \n　　他和晓霞很快谈论起了中学时的生活，他向她打问原来一些同学目前的情况——但没有提起过郝红梅。因为不是一个班，晓霞实际上也并不清楚他和红梅的关系。 \n　　其他人的情况晓霞一无所知，她只是给他简单说了一下孙少平的情况——这是顾养民第一个就问到的人。另外，她还告诉他，听少平说，金波也在黄原东关的邮政所当临时工。至于她哥田润生，养民压根没提起过，她也几乎把他忘了。在他们的印象中，象田润生这样没什么特点的同学，根本不值得一提。 \n　　顾养民显得很兴奋，他说：“老同学们遇一回也不容易，你能不能把少平和金波找来，咱们一块在我家里吃一点饭，好好拉拉话，正好我父母亲也不在，家里很清静。” \n　　晓霞也觉得这个聚会很有意思，就答应说她明天就去找孙少平。 \n　　第二天下午没有课，晓霞就骑了个自行车，破例到城南柴油机厂的工地上去找孙少平。 \n　　她以前很少来这里，一路打问着，才好不容易在一条小沟岔上找到了柴油机厂。进了柴油机厂，她又打听着找到建筑工地上来了。 \n　　孙少平站在脚手架上，往正在砌房墙的三层楼上扔砖。当田晓霞在下面喊他时，他都惊呆了——这家伙怎找到这儿来了？ \n　　楼上所有的民工都停止了手中的活，惊讶地朝下面观望。他们大概弄不明白，这么个花朵一般的“洋”姑娘，怎来找浑身糊着泥巴的揽工小子孙少平呢？她是他的什么人？ \n　　有的工匠立刻和孙少平开起了粗俗不堪的玩笑。孙少平很难堪地从脚手架上溜下来，搓着手上的泥巴，走到田晓霞面前。 \n　　晓霞立刻对他说明了来意。 \n　　孙少平\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
