Initially banished to a backwater punishment planet for her rebellious nature, she aged gracefully, retaining her sharp intellect and Bene Gesserit toughness despite years of adversity. Dortujla is described as having shallow wrinkles around her mouth and bright, alert eyes, with a hobby of collecting old coins and access to a no-ship for smuggling operations.  \n\nHer role within the Bene Gesserit is multifaceted. She serves as a critical operative, often sent into dangerous situations by Mother Superior Odrade, who frequently inquires about her status, underscoring her importance. Dortujla has firsthand experience with the Honored Matres, having been experimented on by them, and later brings vital intelligence to the Sisterhood. She is stationed at Buzzell, where she dispatches a messenger acolyte, Fintil, with crucial information.  \n\nDortujla demonstrates fearlessness, returning to perilous missions and confronting threats like the Spider Queen, an encounter considered significant by the Bene Gesserit. She accompanies Odrade to Junction and represents surviving Keeps at the upcoming Convocation, standing in for other Sisters. Despite her withdrawn demeanor—having witnessed the deaths of fellow Sisters—she remains vigilant, anticipating treachery.  \n\nHer rebellious past and deep insights into the Honored Matres make her a strategic asset, even as she is sometimes used as bait in Bene Gesserit plans. Ultimately, Dortujla lives a long and useful life, dying as one of Odrade's trusted companions.

As a Reverend Mother, FINTIL holds significant authority and responsibility, likely overseeing critical missions or communications for the order.

The planet is rich in **soostones**, valuable jewels produced by the Cholister sea creature, which have drawn the attention of the Great Honored Matre—who suspects their abundance may be a trap.  \n\nBuzzell’s soostones and its potential to house amphibian slaves make it a coveted prize for the Honored Matres, who seek to exploit its resources. The planet is also a hub for smuggling operations, further complicating its political and economic significance.
