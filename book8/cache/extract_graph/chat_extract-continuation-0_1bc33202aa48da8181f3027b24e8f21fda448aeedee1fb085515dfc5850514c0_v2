“你说什么？”她回头怒视向他。\n\n    “啊？你看路。”蓝轩宇惊讶的指指前面。\n\n    “哎呦。”就是回头的工夫，叶灵瞳已经撞上了前面一名学员。那名学员顿时和她一起趔趄着冲出了跑到。\n\n    蓝轩宇眉头微蹙，喃喃的道：“爸爸说过，走路和跑步的时候不能分神。尤其是不能看别的东西。果然有道理唉！”\n\n    十几秒后。叶灵瞳又从后面追上了上来。\n\n    “我套圈你了，你明不明白？”她有些气急败坏的向他叫道。\n\n    “哦。我没注意。”蓝轩宇眨了眨眼睛。\n\n    “你输了！”叶灵瞳高傲的说道。\n\n    蓝轩宇惊讶的看着她，“谁跟你比了？”\n\n    “你……，你怎么一点胜负心都没有？你是不是男孩子？”叶灵瞳怒视他。\n\n    “胜负心和男孩子有什么关系？”或许是受到父亲的性格影响，蓝轩宇还真是没什么胜负心。\n\n    叶灵瞳真想踹他一脚，可后面先前被她落下的学生们已经追了上来。她狠狠的瞪了他一眼，“你等着！”然后就加速向前跑去。\n\n    两个班级，五十多名学生，叶灵瞳是第一个完成的，而蓝轩宇是第三十二个。不算快、也算不上太慢。\n\n    秋雨馨和身边的副班主任道：“这个蓝轩宇怎么有点慢啊！他已经突破十级了，按理说，不该是这个速度。”\n\n    副班主任是一位年长的老师，微笑道：“虽然慢却很稳，他似乎是没有故意求快。这孩子的性格看来挺稳的。也是好事。七岁的孩子，可是少见呢。咦，那是一班的叶灵瞳吧。听说是叶锋团长的女儿，她好像去找蓝轩宇了。”\n\n    秋雨馨也注意到了。蓝轩宇这边才刚跑完，叶灵瞳就向他走过去了。而且还有几分气势汹汹的样子。\n\n    “他们这是要打架？”秋雨馨意兴盎然的道。\n\n    初级魂师学院对于打架这种事儿一向是不太看重的，尤其是天罗学院这种天罗星最好的学院，他们的教学理念是尽可能的挖掘孩子们的天赋，而学校打架，或者说是切磋，往往能激发孩子们的好胜心，在他们看来是好事。尤其是有老师们在旁边看护着，也不会出现什么危险。\n\n    叶灵瞳确实是找上了蓝轩宇，她有些气喘的站到蓝轩宇面前，“我要跟你比试一下。”\n\n    蓝轩宇愣了愣，摇摇头，“我不跟你比。”\n\n    “为什么？”叶灵瞳的声音有些大，两个班级其他的孩子们顿时都被吸引了注意力。\n\n    “好男不跟女斗啊！妈妈说的，不能欺负女孩子\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝轩宇<|>PERSON<|>蓝轩宇 is a student
