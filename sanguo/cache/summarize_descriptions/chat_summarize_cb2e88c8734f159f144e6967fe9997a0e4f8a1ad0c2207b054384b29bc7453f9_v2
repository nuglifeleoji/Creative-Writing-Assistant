This rebellion marked a significant turning point in Chinese history, leading to widespread chaos and the eventual fragmentation of the Han dynasty.\n\n刘备, often depicted as a charismatic and benevolent leader, sought to unify the realm and bring stability back to the people. His vision was not only to reclaim the throne but also to establish a just and prosperous society.
