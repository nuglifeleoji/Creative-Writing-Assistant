先主正慌急之间，此时天色已微明，只见前面喊声震天，朱然军纷纷落涧，滚滚投岩：一彪军杀人，前来救驾。先主大喜，视之，乃常山赵子龙也。时赵云在川中江州，闻吴、蜀交兵，遂引军出；忽见东南一带火光冲天，云心惊，远远探视，不想先主被困，云奋勇冲杀而来。陆逊闻是赵云，急令军退。云正杀之间，忽遇朱然，便与交锋；不一合，一枪刺朱然于马下，杀散吴兵，救出先主，望白帝城而走。先主曰：“朕虽得脱，诸将士将奈何？”云曰：“敌军在后，不可久迟。陛下且入白帝城歇息，臣再引兵去救应诸将。”此时先主仅存百余人入白帝城。后人有诗赞陆逊曰：“持矛举火破连营，玄德穷奔白帝城。一旦威名惊蜀魏，吴王宁不敬书生。”\n\n    却说傅彤断后，被吴军八面围住。丁奉大叫曰：“川兵死者无数，降者极多，汝主刘备已被擒获，今汝力穷势孤，何不早降！”傅彤叱曰：“吾乃汉将，安肯降吴狗乎！”挺枪纵马，率蜀军奋力死战，不下百余合，往来冲突，不能得脱。彤长叹曰：“吾今休矣！”言讫，口中吐血，死于吴军之中。后人赞傅彤诗曰：“彝陵吴蜀大交兵，陆逊施谋用火焚。至死犹然骂吴狗，傅彤不愧汉将军。”\n\n    蜀祭酒程畿，匹马奔至江边，招呼水军赴敌，吴兵随后追来，水军四散奔逃。畿部将叫曰：“吴兵至矣！程祭酒快走罢！”畿怒曰：“吾自从主上出军，未尝赴敌而逃！”言未毕，吴兵骤至，四下无路，畿拔剑自刎。后人有诗赞曰：“慷慨蜀中程祭酒，身留一剑答君王。临危不改平生志，博得声名万古香。”时吴班、张南久围彝陵城，忽冯习到，言蜀兵败，遂引军来救先主，孙桓方才得脱。张、冯二将正行之间，前面吴兵杀来，背后孙桓从彝陵城杀出，两下夹攻。张南、冯习奋力冲突，不能得脱，死于乱军之中。后人有诗赞曰：“冯习忠无二，张南义少双。沙场甘战死，史册共流芳。”\n\n    吴班杀出重围，又遇吴兵追赶；幸得赵云接着，救回白帝城去了。时有蛮王沙摩柯，匹马奔走，正逢周泰，战二十余合，被泰所杀。蜀将杜路，刘宁尽皆降吴。蜀营一应粮草器仗，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ZHAO
