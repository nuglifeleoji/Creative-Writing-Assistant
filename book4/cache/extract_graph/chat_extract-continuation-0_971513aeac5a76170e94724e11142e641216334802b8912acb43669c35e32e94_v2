\n　　一种男性的豪壮气概在田福堂这个瘦弱的儿子身上苏醒了。他“腾”地从驾驶楼里坐起来，脑子里开始盘算他应该干些什么。是的，他已经是一个二十三岁的后生，怎么还能这么窝囊呢？他难道就不能给痛苦的姐夫帮点忙吗？好，他应该立刻到黄原去找姐姐，和她好好谈一谈——他要让姐姐爱姐夫！ \n　　田润生坐在驾驶楼里这样大胆地想着，心在胸膛里狂跳不已。他也不准备去劝说那两个醉汉——让他们哭吧，唱吧；现在也许只有这样，他们的心里才能痛快一些！ \n                  第36章\n　　田润叶的生活眼下仍然没有什么改变。 \n　　虽然她已经是个成了家的妇女，但实际上一直单身一人过日子。 \n　　这样的日子已经过了几年。 \n　　她似乎“习惯”了这种处境；最少在生人看来，她的一切都是正常的。她忙碌而勤恳地工作着，并抓紧时间读些书，以弥补小学教师转为干部后知识上的欠缺。 \n　　只是除过工作，她很少有什么另外的生活。她不爱和别人一块说笑，甚至也很少到她的朋友杜丽丽那里去玩。几乎不看什么电影，因为象她这样年龄的妇女上电影院，总是有男人陪伴的，她不愿去那里受刺激。再说，现在的电影大部分是爱情故事——无论这些故事的结局是好是坏，都会让她浮想联翩而哭一鼻子。 \n　　下班以后，除过有时过去帮二爸收拾一下办公室，她总是呆在团地委她自己的办公室里。当然，这是很寂寞的。一个人长时间悄悄钻在四堵墙里面，就象个土拨鼠。唉，她还不如徐国强爷爷，老人家虽说寂寞，还有一只猫在身边作伴。她总不能也养一只猫吧？ \n　　她就一直这样生活下去吗？她难道不能改变一下自己的境况吗？她为什么不离婚？她为什么不去寻找自己的幸福？在这么大的黄原城，难道不能再有一个她满意的男人？她是不是一辈子就要过这种修女式的生活了？ \n　　一切都说不清楚……对于有些人来说，寻找幸福是一件不容易的事，摆脱苦难同样也不容易。 \n　　田润叶在很大程度上没勇气毅然决然地改变自己的命运。而且随着时间的增长，包围她的那堵精神上的壁垒越来越厚，她的灵魂在这无形的坚甲之中也越来越没有抗争的力量。一方面，她时刻感到痛苦象利刃般尖锐；另一方面，她又想逃避她的现实，尽量使自己不去触及这个她无法治�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
