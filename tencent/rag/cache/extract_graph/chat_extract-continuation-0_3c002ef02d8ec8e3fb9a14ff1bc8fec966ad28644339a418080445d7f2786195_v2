He knew, though, that the lad had observed. If Duncan knew, then Lucilla must know!\n“| don’t think Lucilla knows what you’re doing, sir,” Duncan said, “but it’s getting pretty obvious.” He glanced around him. “If this place didn’t take so much of her attention . .. Where does she dash off to like that?”\n“I think she’s up in the library.”\n“Library!”\n“I agree it’s primitive but it’s also fascinating.” Teg lifted his gaze to the scrollwork on the nearby kitchen ceiling. The moment of decision had arrived. Lucilla could not be depended upon to remain distracted much longer. Teg Shared her fascination, though. It was easy to lose yourself in these marvels. The whole no-globe complex, some two hundred meters in diameter, was a fossil preserved intact from the time of the Tyrant.\nWhen she spoke about it, Lucilla’s voice took on a husky, whispering quality. “Surely, the Tyrant must have known about this place.”\nTeg’s Mentat awareness had been immersed immediately in this suggestion. Why did the Tyrant permit Family Harkonnen to squander so much of their last remaining wealth on such an enterprise?\nPerhaps for that very reason—to drain them.\nThe cost in bribes and Guild shipping from the Ixian factories must have been astronomical.\n“Did the Tyrant know that one day we would need this place?” Lucilla asked.\nNo avoiding the prescient powers that Leto II had so often demonstrated, Teg agreed.\nLooking at Duncan seated across from him, Teg felt his neck hairs rising. There was something eerie about this Harkonnen hideaway, as though the Tyrant himself might have been here. What had happened to the Harkonnens who built it? Teg and Lucilla had found absolutely no clues to why the globe had been abandoned.\nNeither of them could wander through the no-globe without experiencing an acute sense of history. Teg was constantly confounded by unanswered questions.\nLucilla, too, commented on this.\n“Where did they go? There’s nothing in my Other Memories to give the slightest clue.”\n“Did the Tyrant lure them out and kill them?”\n“I’m going back to the library. Perhaps today l'II find something.”\nFor the first two days of their occupation, the globe had received a careful examination by Lucilla and Teg. A silent and sullen Duncan tagged along as though he feared to be left alone. Each new discovery awed them or shocked them.\nTwenty-one skeletons preserved in transparent plaz along a wall near the core! Macabre observers of everyone who passed through there to the machinery chambers and the nullentropy bins.\nPatrin had warned Teg about the skeletons. On one of his first youthful examinations of the globe, Patrin had found records that said the dead ones were the artisans who had built the place, all slain by the Harkonnens to preserve the secret.\nAltogether, the globe was a remarkable achievement, an enclosure cut out of Time, sealed away from everything external. After all of these millennia, its frictionless machinery still created a mimetic projection that even the most modern instruments could not distinguish from the background of dirt and rock.\n“The Sisterhood must acquire this place intact!” Lucilla kept saying. “It’s a treasure house! They even kept their\nfamily’s breeding records!”\nThat wasn’t all the Harkonnens had preserved here. Teg kept finding himself repelled by subtle and gross touches on almost everything in the globe. Like that clock! Clothing, instruments for maintaining the environment, for education and pleasure—everything had been marked by that Harkonnen compulsion to flaunt their uncaring sense of superiority to all other people and all other standards.\nOnce more, Teg thought of Patrin as a youth in this place, probably no older than the ghola. What had prompted Patrin to keep it a secret even from his wife of so many years? Patrin had never touched on the reasons for secrecy, but Teg made his own deductions. An unhappy childhood. The need for his own secret place. Friends who were not friends but only people waiting to sneer at him. None of those companions could be permitted to share such a wonder. It was his! This was more than a place of lonely security. It had been Patrin’s private token of victory.\n“| soent many happy hours there, Bashar. Everything still works. The records are ancient but excellent once you grasp the dialect. There is much knowledge in the place. But you will understand when you get there. You will understand many things | have never told you.”\nThe antique practice floor showed signs of Patrin’s frequent usage. He had changed the weapons coding on some of the automata in a way Teg recognized. The time- counters told of muscle-torturing hours at the complicated exercises. This globe explained those abilities which Teg had always found so remarkable in Patrin. Natural talents had been honed here.\nThe automata of the no-globe were another matter.\nMost of them represented defiance of the ancient proscriptions against such devices. More than that, some had been designed for pleasure functions that confirmed the more revolting stories Teg had heard about the Harkonnens. Pain as pleasure! In its own way, these things explained the\nprimly unbending morality that Patrin had taken away from Gammu.\nRevulsion created its own patterns.\nDuncan took a deep swallow of his drink and looked at Teg over the lip of the cup.\n“Why did you come down here alone when | asked you to complete that last round of exercises?” Teg asked.\n“The exercises made no sense.” Duncan put down his cup.\nWell, Taraza, you were wrong, Teg thought. He has struck out for complete independence sooner than you predicted.\nAlso, Duncan had stopped addressing his Bashar as “sir.”\n“You disobey me?”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Then exactly what is it you’re doing?”\n“I have to know!”\n“You won't like me very much when you do know.”\nDuncan looked startled. “Sir?”\nAhhhh, the “sir” is back!\n“| have been preparing you for certain kinds of very intense pain,” Teg said. “It is necessary before we can restore your original memories.”\n“Pain, sir?”\n“We know of no other way to bring back the original Duncan Idaho—the one who died.”\n“Sir, if you can do that, | will be nothing but grateful.” “So you say. But you may very well see me then as just one more whip in the hands of those who have recalled you\nto life.”\n“Isn't it better to know, sir?”\nTeg passed the back of a hand across his mouth. “If you hate me...can’t say I’d blame you.”\n“Sir, if you were in my place, is that how you would feel?” Duncan’s posture, tone of voice, facial expression—all showed trembling confusion.\nSo far so good, Teg thought. The procedural steps were laid out with a precision that demanded that every response from the ghola be interpreted with care. Duncan was now filled with uncertainty. He wanted something and he feared that thing.\n“I’m only your teacher, not your father!” Teg said.\nDuncan recoiled at the harsh tone. “Aren’t you my friend?”\n“That’s a two-way street. The original Duncan Idaho will have to answer that for himself.”\nA veiled look entered Duncan’s eyes. “Will | remember this place, the Keep, Schwangyu and...”\n“Everything. You’ll undergo a kind of double-vision memory for a time, but you’ll remember it all.”\nA cynical look came over the young face and, when he spoke, it was with bitterness. “So you and | will become comrades.”\nAll of a Bashar’s command and presence in his voice, Teg followed the reawakening instructions precisely.\n“I’m not particularly interested in becoming your comrade.” He fixed a searching glare on Duncan’s face. “You might make Bashar someday. | think it possible you have the right stuff. But l'Il be long dead by then.”\n“You're only comrades with Bashars?”\n“Patrin was my comrade and he never rose above squad leader.”\nDuncan looked into his empty cup and then at Teg. “Why didn’t you order something to drink? You worked hard up there, too.”\nPerceptive question. It did not do to underestimate this youth. He knew that food sharing was one of the most ancient rituals of association.\n“The smell of yours was enough,” Teg said. “Old memories. | don’t need them right now.”\n“Then why did you come down here?”\nThere it was, revealed in the young voice—hope and fear. He wanted Teg to say a particular thing.\n“I wanted to take a careful measurement of how far those exercises have carried you,” Teg said. “I needed to come down here and look at you.”\n“Why so careful?”\nHope and fear! It was time for the precise shift of focus.\n“I’ve never trained a ghola before.”\nGhola. The word lay suspended between them, hanging on the cooking smells that the globe’s filters had not scrubbed from the air. Gho/a! It was laced with spice pungency from Duncan’s empty cup.\nDuncan leaned forward without speaking, his expression eager. Lucilla’s obServation came into Teg’s mind: “He knows how to use silence.”\nWhen it became obvious that Teg would not expand on that simple statement, Duncan sank back with a disappointed look. The left corner of his mouth turned downward, a sullen, festering expression. Everything focused inward the way it had to be.\n“You did not come down here to be alone,” Teg said. “You came here to hide. You're still hiding in there and you think no one will ever find you.”\nDuncan put a hand in front of his mouth. It was a signal gesture for which Teg had been waiting. The instructions for this moment were clear: “The ghola wants the original memories wakened and fears this utterly. That is the major barrier you must sunder.”\n“Take your hand away from your mouth!” Teg ordered.\nDuncan dropped his hand as though it had been burned. He stared at Teg like a trapped animal.\n“Speak the truth,” Teg’s instructions warned. “At this moment, every sense afire, the ghola will see into your heart.”\n“I want you to know,” Teg said, “that what the Sisterhood has ordered me to do to you, that this is distasteful to me.”\nDuncan appeared to crouch into himself. “What did they order you to do?”\n“The skills | was ordered to give you are flawed.”\n“F-flawed?”\n“Part of it was comprehensive training, the intellectual part. In that respect, you have been brought to the level of regimental commander.”\n“Better than Patrin?”\n“Why must you be better than Patrin?”\n“Wasn't he your comrade?”\n“Yes.”\n“You said he never rose above squad leader!”\n“Patrin was fully capable of taking over command of an entire multi-planet force. He was a tactical magician whose wisdom | employed on many occasions.”\n“But you said he never—”\n“It was his choice. The low rank gave him the common touch that we both found useful many times.”\n“Regimental commander?” Duncan’s voice was little more than a whisper. He stared at the tabletop.\n“You have an intellectual grasp of the functions, a bit impetuous but experience usually smooths that out. Your weapons skills are superior for your age.”\nStill not looking at Teg, Duncan asked: “What is my age...\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN<|>PERSON<|>Duncan is a ghola being trained by Teg, with the potential to regain his original memories as Duncan Idaho, a former military commander.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a Bashar and mentor to Duncan, tasked with training him and restoring his original memories, despite finding the process distasteful.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILLA<|>PERSON<|>Lucilla is a member of the Sisterhood, fascinated by the no-globe complex and involved in Duncan's training.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMILY HARKONNEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and wealthy family known for their ruthless behavior and the construction of the no-globe complex.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A secretive and powerful organization that seeks to acquire the no-globe complex for its knowledge and resources.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NO-GLOBE COMPLEX<|>GEO<|>A hidden, fossilized structure preserved from the time of the Tyrant, containing advanced technology and historical records.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRANT<|>PERSON<|>Leto II, a prescient ruler who may have known about the no-globe complex and allowed its construction to drain the Harkonnens' wealth.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRIN<|>PERSON<|>A former comrade of Teg who discovered the no-globe complex in his youth and kept it a secret.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN FACTORIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Factories known for producing advanced technology, including components used in the no-globe complex.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>A prison in Tiruzia where Samuel Namara was held.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>TEG<|>Teg is training Duncan to restore his original memories, despite the emotional and physical pain involved.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN<|>LUCILLA<|>Lucilla is involved in Duncan's training and shares his fascination with the no-globe complex.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>LUCILLA<|>Teg and Lucilla are working together to train Duncan and explore the no-globe complex.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMILY HARKONNEN<|>NO-GLOBE COMPLEX<|>The Harkonnens built the no-globe complex as a secret hideaway and preserved their family records there.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SISTERHOOD<|>NO-GLOBE COMPLEX<|>The Sisterhood seeks to acquire the no-globe complex for its historical and technological value.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRANT<|>FAMILY HARKONNEN<|>The Tyrant may have allowed the Harkonnens to build the no-globe complex to drain their wealth.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATRIN<|>NO-GLOBE COMPLEX<|>Patrin discovered the no-globe complex in his youth and kept it a secret, using it as a personal refuge.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>PATRIN<|>Teg and Patrin were comrades, and Teg has learned much about the no-globe complex from Patrin's experiences.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIAN FACTORIES<|>NO-GLOBE COMPLEX<|>The Ixian factories provided advanced technology used in the construction of the no-globe complex.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
