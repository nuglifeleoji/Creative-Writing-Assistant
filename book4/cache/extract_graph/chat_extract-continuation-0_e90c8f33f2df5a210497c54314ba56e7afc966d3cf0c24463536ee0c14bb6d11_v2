\n　　金俊山抽了两口烟，又改变口气说：“不过，你看能批就批吧。我对你的决定没什么意见……” \n　　金俊山心想，今晚上双水村要是没个人去陪罪，看来玉亭也不好给徐主任交差。既然孙玉亭让老憨憨田二去充数，也就只好让他顶缺去了。 \n　　“那就这样！我还要主持批判会，先走了……”玉亭喝了一口茶水，从椅子上站起来就走了。 \n　　金俊山把他送到大门口，说：“你先走，晚上天气冷，我回去披件衣裳就来了……” \n　　孙玉亭匆忙地从金俊山家的土坡上下来，顺着哭咽河畔的小路，向金家湾后面的小学赶去。他远远地看见，那里已经闪烁起灯火，并且聚集起一大片熙熙攘攘的人群…… \n                  第9章\n　　今晚，双水村小学院子里又开始热闹起来了。除过本村男女老少一吃完饭就被集合到这里以外，在大灶上吃完饭的外村民工也都被带到这里来了。不多时分，这院子里就已经挤得水泄不通。外村的民工在院子的南头，一般都是同村人挤在一块。双水村本村的人在院子的北头，大人娃娃夹在一起，有站的，有坐的，吵吵闹闹，象一锅煮沸了的水。 \n　　在这一片人中，全村的男人都混杂着，但女人却大约可以分出田家的一片，金家的一片；因为本族妇女家挨得近，平时关系熟悉，现在挤到一块好拉话。当然，这中间也多少有一点金、田两家的门户之见。一般说来，金家的媳妇穿戴都比较齐整，坐的姿势也比较合乎农村的礼教规范：公众场合不能酸眉醋眼，张东望西。可以笑，但不能把嘴巴张得象窑口一样。坐时应两膝并拢，不能八叉双腿。也有些金家的年轻妇女不管这一套，使得她们的母亲或婆婆不时在人群中用眼光提出警告。另外人家的妇女就不受这种约束了，说说笑笑，打打闹闹，跟赶集上会一般。也有一些胆大的恋爱者，乘混乱之机，眉来眼去不说，甚至还偷着捏捏揣揣。男人们大都一人一杆旱烟锅，抽得院子上空云绕雾缭。有些乏累过度的庄稼人，不顾体面地大叉双腿睡在土地上。不时有人去不远处的金家祖坟那里撒尿，气得金家一些老者跑过去乱吼乱骂一通。 \n　　这时候，双水村妇女主任贺凤英，正领着本村和外村的一些“铁姑娘”，忙碌地布置会场。她们把课桌从教室里抬出两张来，拼在一起放到人群面前，上面铺了窑门口摘下来的条格布门帘，又放几个暖水瓶和茶缸，算是主席\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
