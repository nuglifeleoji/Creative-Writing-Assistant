\n　　所有这一切，她必然被人注意和议论。她呢，装个听不见，照样我行我素。不久前，她用粗劳动布自己裁缝了一个裤口稍微敞开的裤子，全公社当然又当作稀罕事立即议论开了。先是爱饶舌的公社文书杨立孝说过裤子叫什么“嘈叭裤”，是“洋人”穿的。接着，老百姓就到处传辩南马河学校的吴月琴穿了一条“吹鼓手裤”。这一来，逢公社遇集，好多人竟然跑到小学校来观看她的“吹鼓手裤”，弄得她连课都上不下去。 \n　　她在大队的小学校里教书，就是极不喜欢她的人，也都说她书教得好。她会跳舞，会唱歌，尤其会画画。小提琴也拉得很好，还懂英语。她把一群乡山圪土劳里娃娃一个个唱歌的比县城里的娃娃都开化灵醒。村里的老乡不管对她有什么看法，都因这一点而喜欢她，爱她。她几天不在了，全村人就感到空朗朗的。 \n　　但对她反感的人也确实不少。这些人主要是一些吴月琴所戏称的“国营干部”。而在这些人里边，对她最反感的恐怕要数冯国斌了。 \n　　冯国斌得个“黑煞神”的外号，不仅因为他的脸长得黑而粗糙，那面部表情就是笑了也给人一种望而生畏的感觉；更主要的是这人脾性暴躁而古怪，动不动爱发火。他这人就是作错了什么事，也很少用书面或口头作检查，只是用行动来改正。他对普通老百姓的缺点是亚厉的，但对上级的错误更不客气。就因为这一点，却赢得了普遍的尊敬。由于此公秉性耿直，那些想利用人职为自己谋点什么的干部，在他手下工作，寒心极了。这是过去年代培养起来的那种典型的共产党人：对党的事业忠贞不二，但有些事情上又显得古板了一点。不用说，他对一切超越正常规范的行为都深恶痛绝。 \n　　他对吴月琴不光反感，而且有点敌视。这倒并不是因为她的出身。他知道她父母也许完全是被陷害的好人——“文化革命”十年来这种事还少吗？他主要反感吴月琴本人。在他看来，这女孩子身上缺点太多，浑身有一股“资产阶级味”；而且行为又那么放浪，根本不懂人情世故。他甚至怀疑她是否有正常人的道德情操观念。 \n　　这一天，公社文书杨立孝告诉这位“黑煞神”说，他听人的反映，吴月琴近来不光自己唱外国“黄色歌曲”，而且还教娃娃们唱哩。 \n　　冯国斌一听就起火了，马上打发人去叫吴月琴。他要�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
