\n　　我愿她拿着细细的皮鞭，不断轻轻地打在我身上……从金波的歌声中，少平已经全部体会到了朋友心中的伤感情绪。他知道，金波在唱这歌的时候，一定是满脸泪水涟涟…… \n　　在一次交谈中，少平问他：“你打算怎办呀？”金波对他说：“我准备到黄原找我父亲，跟他去学开车。我无心在村里呆下去。将来开个汽车也好，一个人随随便便，也省得和众人搅在一起心烦……” \n　　金波说了他的打算后，犹豫一下，又补充说：“本来我有些事不该瞒你。但我现在心情不好，不想提这些事。以后我一定会给你原原本本说出来……” \n　　少平完全理解朋友，对他点点头。 \n　　三天以后，金波就坐顺车去了黄原。临走前他对少平说，他先去看看能不能上车，然后再赶回来在村里过春节——据说今年春节各个村都要闹秧歌……金波走后，学校的工作正进入繁忙阶段。因快要进行期终考试，教师得分别给学生们辅导功课。有些学习特别差的同学，还要单另给“吃小灶”。 \n　　少平的班上有金光亮的一个孩子。这孩子数学不错，但语文很差，连篇简单的作文也写不好。少平对这娃娃的功课很着急。 \n　　这一天下午他改完作文后，发现金三锤的作文满篇都是胡言乱语，便临时决定晚上到金光亮家去给这孩子好好开导一下。 \n　　孙家的人要进金光亮家的门，这可是村里的一条大新闻。自从孙玉亭在文化革命初带着造反队，把金家三兄弟的家砸得象破庙一般以来，十来年里这家人就和孙家断绝了交往；甚至面对面碰上也不打个招呼。现在，孙玉亭的侄儿竟然要到金光亮家给他的儿子去辅导作文，对于双水村的公众来说，就象基辛格第一次去中国那样富有爆炸性。 \n　　当少平把自己的意思给姚淑芳说了以后，淑芳非常高兴少平去她大哥家。姚老师是个有文化知识的人，觉得十年前两家人结下的疙瘩还不解开，这太不正常了。因为一直碍着他哥和他弟两家人，她多年来也没勇气破这个“家规”。现在，年轻的孙老师表现了如此豁达的精神，这使淑芳很受感动。 \n　　这天晚上，她事先没有征求他哥的意见，就把少平带到了光亮新搬迁的家里。 \n　　金光亮两口子见孙玉亭的侄儿进了自家门，猛一下反应不过来这是怎么一回事，竟然呆住了。 \n　　金三锤倒立刻亲热而尊敬地拉过来一个凳子，说：“孙老师，你快坐！” \n　　淑芳马上对大哥和嫂子说：“三锤作文太差，少平很关心他，专门到咱家给他辅导来了！” \n　　金光亮夫妇\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
