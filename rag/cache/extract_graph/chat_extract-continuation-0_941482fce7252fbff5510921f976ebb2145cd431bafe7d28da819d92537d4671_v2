Wet sand gritted under her feet. Soon, it will be dry sand. She dressed without bothering to towel herself. Clothing gripped her flesh uncomfortably, but she ignored this, walking up the strand away from the others, not looking back at the sea.\nSouvenirs of memory must be only that. Things to be taken up and fondled occasionally for evocation of past joys. No joy can be permanent. All is transient. “This, too, shall pass away” applies to all of our living universe.\nWhere the beach became loamy dirt and a few sparse plants, she turned finally and looked back at the sea she had just condemned.\nOnly life itself mattered, she told herself. And life could not endure without an ongoing thrust of procreation.\nSurvival. Our children must survive. The Bene Gesserit must survive!\nNo single child was more important than the totality. She accepted this, recognizing it as the species talking to her\nfrom her deepest self, the self she had first encountered as Sea Child.\nOdrade allowed Sea Child one last sniff of salt air as they returned to their vehicles and prepared to drive into Eldio. She felt herself grow calm. That essential balance, once learned, did not require a sea to maintain it.\nUproot your questions from their ground and the dangling roots will be seen. More questions!\n— MENTAT ZENSUFI\nD ama was in her element.\nSpider Queen!\nShe liked the witches’ title for her. This was the heart of her web, this new control center on Junction. The exterior of the building still did not suit her. Too much Guild complacency in its design. Conservative. But the interior had begun to take on a familiarity that soothed her. She could almost imagine she had never left Dur, that there had been no Futars and the harrowing flight back into the Old Empire.\nShe stood in the open door of the Assembly Room looking out at the Botanical Garden. Logno waited four paces behind. Not too close behind me, Logno, or I shall have to kill you.\nThere was still dew on the lawn beyond the tiles where, when the sun had risen far enough, servants would distribute comfortable chairs and tables. She had ordered a sunny day and Weather had damned well better produce it. Logno’s report was interesting. So the old witch had returned to Buzzell. And she was angry, too. Excellent. Obviously, she knew she was being watched and she had visited her supreme witch to ask for removal from Buzzell, for sanctuary. And she had been refused.\nThey don’t care that we destroy their limbs just as long as the central body remains hidden.\nSpeaking over her shoulder to Logno, Dama said: “Bring that old witch to me. And all of her attendants.”\nAs Logno turned to obey, Dama added: “And begin starving some Futars. | want them hungry.”\n“Yes, Dama.”\nSomeone else moved into Logno’s attendant position. Dama did not turn to identify the replacement. There were always enough aides to carry out necessary orders. One was much like another except in the matter of threat. Logno was a constant threat. Keeps me alert.\nDama inhaled deeply of the fresh air. It was going to be a good day precisely because that was what she desired. She gathered in her secret memories then and let them soothe her.\nGuldur be blessed! We’ve found the place to rebuild our strength.\nConsolidation of the Old Empire was proceeding as planned. There would not be many witches’ nests left out there and, once that damnable Chapterhouse was found, the limbs could be destroyed at leisure.\nIx, now. There was a problem. Perhaps I should not have killed those two Ixian scientists yesterday.\nBut the fools had dared demand “more information” from her. Demanded! And after saying they still had no solution to rearming The Weapon. Of course, they did not know it was a weapon. Did they? She could not be sure. So it had been a good thing to kill those two after all. Teach them a lesson.\nBring us answers, not questions.\nShe liked the order she and her Sisters were creating in the Old Empire. There had been too much wandering about and too many different cultures, too many unstable religions.\nWorship of Guldur will serve them as it serves us.\nShe felt no mystical affinity to her religion. It was a useful tool of power. The roots were well known: Leto II, the one\nthose witches called “The Tyrant,” and his father, Muad’Dib. Consummate power brokers, both of them. Lots of schismatic cells around but those could be weeded out. Keep the essence. It was a well-lubricated machine.\nThe tyranny of the minority cloaked in the mask of the majority.\nThat was what the witch Lucilla had recognized. No way to let her live after discovering she knew how to manipulate the masses. The witch nests would have to be found and burned. Lucilla’s perceptiveness clearly was not an isolated example. Her actions betrayed the workings of a school. They taught this thing! Fools! You had to manage reality or things really got out of control.\nLogno returned. Dama could always tell the sound of her footsteps. Furtive.\n“The old witch will be brought from Buzzell,” Logno said. “And her attendants.”\n“Don’t forget about the Futars.”\n“I have given the orders, Dama.”\nOily voice! You'd like to feed me to the herd, wouldn't you, Logno?\n“And tighten up security on the cages, Logno. Three more of them escaped last night. They were wandering around in the garden when | awoke.”\n“I was told, Dama. More cage guards have been assigned.”\n“And don’t tell me they’re harmless without a Handler.”\n“I do not believe that, Dama.”\nAnd that’s truth from her, for once. Futars terrify her. Good.\n“| believe we have our power base, Logno.” Dama turned, noting that Logno had encroached at least two millimeters into the danger zone. Logno saw it, too, and retreated. As close as you want in front where I can see you, Logno, but not behind my back.\nLogno saw the orange blaze in Dama’s eyes and almost knelt. Definite bending of the knees. “It is my eagerness to serve you, Dama!”\nYour eagerness to replace me, Logno.\n“What of that woman from Gammu? Odd name. What was it?”\n“Rebecca, Dama. She and some of her companions have... ahhh, temporarily eluded us. We will find them. They cannot get off the planet.”\n“You think | should have kept her here, don’t you?”\n“It was wise to think of her as bait, Dama!”\n“She’s still bait. That witch we found on Gammu did not go to those people by accident.”\n“Yes, Dama.”\nYes, Dama! But the subservient sound in Logno’s voice was enjoyable. “Well, get on with it!”\nLogno scurried away.\nThere were always those little cells of potential violence meeting secretly somewhere. Building up their mutual charges of hate, swarming out to disrupt the orderly lives around them. Someone always had to clean up after those disruptions. Dama sighed. Terror tactics were so... SO temporary!\nSuccess, that was the danger. It had cost them an empire. If you waved your success around like a banner someone always wanted to cut you down. Envy!\nWe will hold our success more cautiously this time.\nShe fell into a semi-reverie, still alert to the sounds behind her, but relishing the evidence of new victories that had been displayed to her this morning. She liked to roll the names of captive planets silently on her tongue.\nWallach, Kronin, Reenol, Ecaz, Bela Tegeuse, Gammu, Gamont, Niushe...\nHumans are born with a susceptibility to that most persistent and debilitating disease of intellect: self-deception. The best of all possible worlds and the worst get their dramatic coloration from it. As nearly as we can determine, there is no natural immunity. Constant alertness is required.\n—THE CODA\nW ith Odrade away from Central (and probably only for a short time) Bellonda knew swift action was required. That damned Mentat-ghola is too dangerous to live!\nMother Superior’s party was barely out of sight into the lowering afternoon before Bellonda was on her way to the no-ship.\nNot for Bellonda a thoughtful approach through ring orchards. She ordered space on a tube, windowless, automatic, and fast. Odrade, too, had observers who might send unwanted messages.\nEn route, Bellonda reviewed her assessment of Idaho’s many lives. A record she had kept in Archives ready for quick retrieval. In the original and early gholas, his character had been dominated by impulsiveness. Quick to hate, quick to give loyalty. Later Idaho-gholas tempered this with cynicism but the underlying impulsiveness remained. The Tyrant had called it to action many times. Bellonda recognized a pattern.\nHe can be goaded by pride.\nHis long service to the Tyrant fascinated her. Not only had he been a Mentat several times but there was evidence he had been a Truthsayer in more than one incarnation.\nIdaho’s appearance reflected what she saw in her records. Interesting character lines, a look around the eyes\nand a set to his mouth that went with complex inner development.\nWhy would Odrade not accept the danger of this man? Bellonda had felt frequent misgivings when Odrade spoke of Idaho with such flaunting of her emotions.\n“He thinks clearly and directly. There’s a fastidious cleanliness about his mind. It’s restorative. | like him and | know that’s a trivial thing to influence my decisions.”\nShe admits his influence!\nBellonda found Idaho alone and seated at his console. His attention was fixed on a linear display she recognized: the no-ship’s operational schematics. He washed the projection when he saw her.\n“Hello, Bell. Been expecting you.”\nHe touched his console field and a door opened behind him. Young Teg entered and took up a position near Idaho, staring silently at Bellonda.\nIdaho did not invite her to sit or find a chair for her, forcing her to bring one from his sleeping chamber and place it facing him. When she was seated, he turned a look of wary amusement to her.\nBellonda remained taken aback by his greeting. Why did he expect me?\nHe answered her unspoken question. “Dar projected earlier, told me she was off to see Sheeana. | knew you'd waste no time getting to me when she was gone.”\nSimple Mentat Projection or... “She warned you!”\n“Wrong.”\n“What secrets do you and Sheeana share?” Demanding.\n“She uses me the way you want her to use me.”\n“The Missionaria!”\n“Bell! Two Mentats together. Must we play these stupid games?”\nBellonda took a deep breath and sought Mentat mode. Not easy under these circumstances, that child staring at her, the amusement on Idaho’s face. Was Odrade displaying\nan unsuspected slyness? Working against a Sister with this ghola?\nIdaho relaxed when he saw Bene Gesserit intensity become that doubled focus of the Mentat. “I’ve known for a long time that you want me dead, Bell.”\nYes ... | have been readable in my fears.\nIt had been very close there, he thought. Bellonda had come to him with death in mind, a little drama to create “the necessity” all prepared. He entertained few illusions about his ability to match her in violence. But Bellonda- Mentat would observe before acting.\n“It\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a character who reflects on life and survival, associated with the Bene Gesserit and Sea Child memories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and secretive organization focused on survival and control, with deep political and religious influence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEA CHILD<|>PERSON<|>A deep self-identity of Odrade, representing her connection to the sea and primal instincts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELDIO<|>GEO<|>A location where Odrade and others prepare to drive into, possibly a city or region)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAT ZENSUFI<|>PERSON<|>A Mentat philosopher who provides wisdom about self-deception and human nature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAMA<|>PERSON<|>A powerful leader referred to as Spider Queen, consolidating the Old Empire and opposing the Bene Gesserit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNCTION<|>GEO<|>A location where Dama has established a new control center, possibly a planet or city)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUR<|>GEO<|>A place Dama reminisces about, possibly her former home or base)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Creatures used by Dama, possibly dangerous and requiring handlers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUZZELL<|>GEO<|>A location where an old witch was held and later brought to Dama)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group or planet known for its scientists, some of whom were killed by Dama)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GULDUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A religion or power system worshipped by Dama and her followers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCILLA<|>PERSON<|>A witch who understood the manipulation of masses, killed by Dama)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGNOS<|>PERSON<|>An aide to Dama, possibly a threat or rival)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REBECCA<|>PERSON<|>A woman from Gammu who temporarily eluded capture by Dama's forces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet where Rebecca and others were sought by Dama)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>A Bene Gesserit member who distrusts the Mentat-ghola Idaho and acts against him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>A Mentat-ghola with a complex history, seen as dangerous by Bellonda)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>A young associate of Idaho, possibly protective or aligned with him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>A figure associated with the Missionaria and possibly allied with Idaho)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSIONARIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group or function within the Bene Gesserit, possibly involved in manipulation or control)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a member of the Bene Gesserit, deeply involved in its survival<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SEA CHILD<|>Sea Child is a part of Odrade's identity, representing her primal self<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>ELDIO<|>Odrade travels to Eldio, indicating a connection or purpose there<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>JUNCTION<|>Dama has established a control center on Junction, central to her power<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Dama opposes the Bene Gesserit and seeks to destroy their influence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>LOGNOS<|>Lognos serves Dama but is also a potential threat<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>FUTARS<|>Dama uses Futars as tools or weapons, keeping them controlled<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>BUZZELL<|>Dama orders the capture of an old witch from Buzzell<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>IX<|>Dama interacts with Ixian scientists, resulting in conflict<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>GULDUR<|>Dama follows and promotes the worship of Guldur<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>LUCILLA<|>Dama had Lucilla killed for her knowledge and threat<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>REBECCA<|>Dama seeks to capture Rebecca for strategic reasons<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>IDAHO<|>Bellonda distrusts and seeks to eliminate Idaho<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>ODRADE<|>Bellonda acts against Odrade's interests in Idaho's case<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>TEG<|>Teg is aligned with Idaho, possibly as a protector<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>SHEEANA<|>Idaho and Sheeana share secrets or alliances<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IDAHO<|>MISSIONARIA<|>Idaho is used by the Missionaria for their purposes<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
