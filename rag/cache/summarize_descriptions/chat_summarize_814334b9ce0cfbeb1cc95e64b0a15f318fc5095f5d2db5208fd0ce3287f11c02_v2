The repetition of this information across descriptions suggests a widely reported incident, with one source explicitly framing it as part of the risks faced by journalists.  \n\nThe summary resolves minor variations in phrasing (e.g., \"Durke\" vs. \"Durke Bataglani\") by standardizing the name to its full form for clarity.
