条崎就是在这里出现的啊，草S想。\n    “可是光这样说他还是找不到吧？”\n    “富坚当然急着想知道详细住址。我让他在外面等着，自己进屋，一边看地图一边把住址抄在便条纸上。那个住址，位于污水处理厂那边。我把便条纸一给他，那个白痴就高兴得要命，还说我帮了大忙。”\n    “您为何要捏造那种地方的住址？”\n    “那当然是为了把他骗到杳无人迹的地方，我从以前就对污水处理厂附近的地理环境很熟悉。”\n    “请问一下。这么说来，您从见到富坚先生的那一刻起，就已决定要杀害他了吗？”草S边问边凝视石神，这段内容太惊人了。\n    “那当然。”石神稳如泰山地回答，“我刚才也说过了，我必须保护花冈靖子。一旦有折磨她的男人出现，就得尽快加以铲除，这是我的职责。”\n    “您确信富坚先生在折磨花冈靖子吗？”\n    “不是确信，是知道。花冈靖子一直受那个男人折磨。为了逃离他，才搬来隔壁。”\n    “这是花冈小姐亲口告诉您的吗？”\n    “我说过了，我是透过特殊的联络方式得知的。”\n    石神的语气毫无滞碍。当然，既然会来自首，想必脑中已充分整理过了。但他的叙述有太多不自然的地方，最起码和草S到目前为止对石神的印象差了十万八千里。\n    “您把便条纸给他，然后怎样了？”他决定还是先听完下文再说。\n    “他问我知不知道花冈靖子上班的地点。我说地点我不清楚，只听说是个餐饮店。此外，我还告诉他，她通常十一点下班，女儿也会去店里等她下班再一起回家。当然，这完全都是我瞎掰的。”\n    “这样瞎掰的理由是？”\n    “为了限制他的行动，就算那个地点再怎么僻静，还是不能让他太早抵达。我想他只要听说花冈靖子十一点才下班，而且在那之前女儿也不会回家，应该就不会提早去公寓找她们了。”\n    “抱歉。”草S伸出手，打断他的话，“这些念头，全都是您在那一瞬间想出来的吗？”\n    “是的。有什么问题吗？”\n    “不……我只是觉得很佩服，您竟然能当下就想出那个缜密的计谋。”\n    “这不算什么吧。”石神恢复严肃的表情。“他一心只想赶快见到花冈靖子。所以对我来说，只要利用他这种心态就行了，一点也不难。”\n    “当然，对您来说或许是吧。”草S舔舔唇。“后来呢？”\n    “最后我把我的手机号码告诉他，叫他如果找不到公寓再跟我联络。通常如果有人好心到这种地步，一般人至少会怀疑一下，可是那家伙却丝毫没起\n######################\nOutput:",
