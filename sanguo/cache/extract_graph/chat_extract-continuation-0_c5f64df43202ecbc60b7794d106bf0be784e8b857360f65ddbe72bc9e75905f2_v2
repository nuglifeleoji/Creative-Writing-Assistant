望前进发。但见黄沙漠漠，狂风四起；道路崎岖，人马难行。操有回军之心，问于郭嘉。嘉此时不伏水土，卧病车上。操泣曰：“因我欲平沙漠，使公远涉艰辛，以至染病，吾心何安！”嘉曰：“某感丞相大恩，虽死不能报万一。”操曰：“吾见北地崎岖，意欲回军，若何？”嘉曰：“兵贵神速。今千里袭人，辎重多而难以趋利，不如轻兵兼道以出，掩其不备。但须得识径路者为引导耳。”\n\n    遂留郭嘉于易州养病，求向导官以引路。人荐袁绍旧将田畴深知此境，操召而问之。畴曰：“此道秋夏间有水，浅不通车马，深不载舟楫，最难行动。不如回军，从卢龙口越白檀之险，出空虚之地，前近柳城，掩其不备：蹋顿可一战而擒也。”操从其言，封田畴为靖北将军，作向导官，为前驱；张辽为次；操自押后：倍道轻骑而进。\n\n    田畴引张辽前至白狼山，正遇袁熙、袁尚会合蹋顿等数万骑前来。张辽飞报曹操。操自勒马登高望之，见蹋顿兵无队伍，参差不整。操谓张辽曰：“敌兵不整，便可击之。”乃以麾授辽。辽引许褚、于禁、徐晃分四路下山，奋力急攻，蹋顿大乱。辽拍马斩蹋顿于马下，余众皆降。袁熙、袁尚引数千骑投辽东去了。操收军入柳城，封田畴为柳亭侯，以守柳城。畴涕泣曰：“某负义逃窜之人耳，蒙厚恩全活，为幸多矣；岂可卖卢龙之寨以邀赏禄哉！死不敢受侯爵。”操义之，乃拜畴为议郎。操抚慰单于人等，收得骏马万匹，即日回兵。时天气寒且旱，二百里无水，军又乏粮，杀马为食，凿地三四十丈，方得水。操回至易州，重赏先曾谏者；因谓众将曰：“孤前者乘危远征，侥幸成功。虽得胜，天所佑也，不可以为法。诸君之谏，乃万安之计，是以相赏。后勿难言。”\n\n    操到易州时，郭嘉已死数日，停柩在公廨。操往祭之，大哭曰：“奉孝死，乃天丧吾也！”回顾众官曰：“诸君年齿，皆孤等辈，惟奉孝最少，吾欲托以后事。不期中年夭折，使吾心肠崩裂矣！”嘉之左右，将嘉临死所封之书呈上曰：“郭公临亡，亲笔书此，嘱曰：丞相若从书中所言，辽东事定矣。”操拆书视之，点头嗟叹。诸人皆不知其意。次日，夏侯惇引众人禀曰：“辽东太守公孙康，�\n######################\nOutput:",
