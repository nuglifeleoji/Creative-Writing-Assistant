��妈每顿饭都把酒杯给你搁着哩！”少平举起的酒杯在嘴边猛地停住了。他呆呆地怔了一会，然后便一饮而尽。这醇美的酒啊！ \n　　惠英嫂岔开话题，说：“我今天也休班，本来想洗衣服，可明明硬缠着要我和他到外面去放风筝。这娃娃惯坏了……” \n　　“你又说我坏话啦！” \n　　明明噘着嘴对母亲嚷道。小黑子也为它的主人帮腔，朝惠英嫂“汪汪”地叫了两声。 \n　　少平忍不住笑了，说：“我也跟你们去放风筝！”明明高兴得嗷嗷价叫起来。 \n　　孙少平吃喝停当后，就和惠英嫂、明明和小黑子，拿起那只蝴蝶风筝，一块相跟着来到矿区东边的山野里。 \n　　他们到了一块平地上，说着，笑着，把那只风筝放上了蔚蓝的天空，少平把着明明的手帮他绽线团；小黑子“汪汪”叫着，跑去追撵越飞越远的大蝴蝶。惠英坐在旁边的草地上，把一些吃喝在塑料布上摆开，然后泪蒙蒙地看着儿子，看着少平，看着欢奔的小狗和蓝天上那只飘飘飞飞的花蝴蝶…… \n                  第38章\n　　“……根据爱因斯坦相对论的原理，三维宇宙是一个具有封闭的三维球拓扑性的宇宙。这样的封闭宇宙必然会有它的始终点。时空以大爆炸为始，宇宙万物演化发展，以至最后塌缩成黑洞随之发生大崩溃到达时空奇点为终。时间“终止”，空间成了一个点，时空曲率而成为无穷大，所有物理定律失去意义，一切物质状态被撕得粉碎……” \n　　“可是，新的四维宇宙观认为，真实宇宙不仅是一个由常态质的形式存在为存在的三维空间，并以异态质的形式及以各种能的形式存在为存在的四维相空间，以及由它们所构成的一个多层次、互为开放和互为制约的无边无际的存在。这种宇宙显然是永恒的。它没有起点，也没有终点。因为它是互为开放和互为制约的，所以在各个层次上又是变化多端、循环不息、彼消此长和互为渗透的。这有点象我国古代的阴阳图。用哲学术语表述，就是‘阴极而阳生，阳盛而阴退’，即通常所说的物极必反。” \n　　“相对论法则认为，要使某个物质——即是这个物质很小很轻，甚至只有一个分子，但要具有光的速度几乎是不可能的。当然，现代实验室中某些实验物质除外。”“可是，宇宙中确实已观察到超光速现象了。”
