Primarily, he is a university researcher and a member of the *Submarine* development team, contributing to the creation of the game. Additionally, he serves as a tutor for **唐泽雪穗 (Karazawa Yukiho)**, teaching her mathematics and computer-related subjects. As her tutor, he is empathetic toward her academic pressures and supports educational approaches that reduce excessive testing.  \n\n正晴's connection to 雪穗 extends beyond academics; he harbors personal feelings for her and becomes entangled in the events surrounding her life. He investigates incidents linked to her, including the death of **西本文代 (Nishimoto Fumiyo)**, 雪穗's mother, which is speculated to be either a suicide or an accident. Through conversations with **田川 (Tagawa)**, he gathers information about the circumstances of her mother's passing. 正晴 also lends 雪穗 a cassette tape, further deepening their interactions.  \n\nHis involvement in the *Submarine* program leak investigation highlights his technical expertise, while his emotional investment in 雪穗's well-being reveals a compassionate and concerned side. Despite the varied descriptions, his character consistently emerges as a diligent researcher, a dedicated tutor, and an individual deeply affected by the tragedies surrounding 雪穗. The contradictions in the descriptions—such as whether he investigates 雪穗's mother's death or the *Submarine* leak—are reconciled by his dual roles: as a technical expert assisting in the leak inquiry and as a personal figure probing into 雪穗's past.  \n\nIn summary, 正晴 is a complex figure whose professional and personal lives intertwine, driven by his intellectual pursuits, mentorship responsibilities, and emotional ties to 雪穗. His actions reflect both his analytical mind and his empathetic nature.\",14\n321,生野区,\"生野区是雪穗曾经居住的地方，也是田川不动产的管理区域之一。\"\"\",2\n107,田川敏夫,\"田川敏夫（Tagawa Toshio）是田川不动产（Tagawa Real Estate）的一名员工，担任房东一职，曾与西本雪穗（Nishimoto Yukiho）有过互动。他在工作中帮助西本雪穗开门，并在此过程中发现了西本文代（Nishimoto Fumiyo）的尸体。此外，田川敏夫也是一名棒球迷，尤其支持读卖巨人队（Yomiuri Giants）。  \n\n这一综合描述整合了田川敏夫的工作背景、与西本雪穗的关联、其在事件中的关键发现，以及个人兴趣爱好，确保信息连贯且无矛盾。\",4\n295,美浓部,美浓部是正晴的研究室同伴，同时也是“Submarine”开发团队的成员，主导调查该程序泄露事件。作为团队的核心人员之一，美浓部在调查过程中发挥了关键作用，致力于追踪和解决程序泄露的问题。他的双重身份——既是研究室的成员，又是开发团队的一员——使他能够深入参与事件的分析与处理，确保调查的全面性和准确性。,5\n314,冰球社,冰球社是正晴和内藤参与的大学社团,2\n297,垣内,\"垣内（Kakiuchi）是正晴（Masaharu）的朋友，主要从事历史新闻报道的研究工作。他对家教学生的事件感到惊讶，并为正晴提供了相关信息。作为正晴的友人，垣内既在学术领域有所涉猎，又对身边发生的事件保持关注，展现出其研究者的敏锐性和乐于助人的一面。  \n\n（Note: The description combines both English and Chinese sources, ensuring all provided details are included without contradiction.

Additionally, the company has been accused of plagiarizing the *Submarine* program, raising concerns about intellectual property violations.  \n\nIn summary, 无限企划 operates as a computer game distribution business but is embroiled in controversy over its alleged involvement in the unauthorized dissemination and possible theft of software, particularly the *Submarine* program. Despite these issues, it remains linked to Kirihara and Tomohiko, with indications that it may have ties to ongoing or revived projects in game development.\",8\n244,SUBMARINE,\"**SUBMARINE** is a computer game program originally developed by students at North Osaka University's Sixth Research Laboratory, under the leadership of Masaharu and his research team. The project was created by a team of six members, showcasing their collaborative efforts in game development. However, the program was allegedly leaked or stolen by the company \"\"无限企划\"\" (Mugen Kikaku), which later claimed it as their own flagship game. According to some accounts, the game was provided to the company by an individual named Kirihara (桐原), though the circumstances surrounding this transfer remain unclear. The incident has been described as a case of plagiarism, with the original creators accusing \"\"无限企划\"\" of appropriating their work without authorization. Despite the controversy, **SUBMARINE** remains recognized as a student-led project from North Osaka University, highlighting both its innovative origins and the disputed nature of its later commercialization.\",6\n114,田川不动产,\"**田川不动产**是一家房地产公司，主要经营物业管理及相关业务。该公司管理过**雪穗**及其母亲曾居住的吉田公寓，并在该公寓的煤气中毒事件中由员工发现了尸体。此外，田川不动产负责管理出租住宅的备用钥匙，并在必要时协助开门，其业务范围覆盖大阪市的生野区和东成区，设有分店。  \n\n正晴（小说《白夜行》中的角色）曾通过田川不动产了解到与雪穗母亲相关的事件。作为一家综合性房地产管理公司，田川不动产在社区事务中扮演了重要角色，既参与日常物业管理，也涉及紧急事件的应对。  \n\n（注：以上信息整合自多段描述，确保逻辑连贯，无矛盾。）\",6\n245,MARINE CRASH,\"**MARINE CRASH** is a computer game sold by *Unlimited Planning* (无限企划).

However, there are allegations that *MARINE CRASH* may have plagiarized the *Submarine* program, raising questions about its originality.  \n\nIn summary, *MARINE CRASH* is a game developed and marketed by *Unlimited Planning*, bearing a name suggested by Nami-e and approved by Kirihara. While it shares similarities with *Submarine*, its legitimacy has been challenged due to suspicions of program plagiarism. The exact nature of its relationship to *Submarine* remains unclear, but the controversy suggests potential unauthorized use of the original game's design or code.\",3\n308,田川,田川是一位不动产中介，曾参与吉田公寓煤气中毒事件的调查。他在事件中扮演了重要角色，不仅是发现西本文代尸体的人，还与警方进行了多次交流，对事件细节有一定了解。此外，田川提供了关于死亡时间的关键信息，并指出如果更早介入，可能有机会挽救西本文代的生命。综合来看，田川作为事件的知情者和调查参与者，掌握了与案件相关的多方面信息，包括时间线索和现场情况，其陈述对厘清事件经过具有重要参考价值。,5\n310,深江桥,深江桥是位于东成区的一个地点，与田川不动产的分店相关。该地点是田川不动产的另一家店铺所在地，表明此处至少设有一家田川不动产的分支机构。综合描述显示，深江桥作为东成区的一个区域或地标，与田川不动产的商业活动存在明确关联，可能是其分店运营的场所之一。,3\n296,中道,\"A member of the 'Submarine' development team who is being questioned about the program leak\"\"\",1\n306,第六研究室,,1\n288,UNLIMITED PLANNING,\"Unlimited Planning is a company that sells computer games via mail order, including a game called 'Marine Crash' which is very similar to the 'Submarine' game created by the students at the university.\",3\n293,MINOBU,Minobu is a graduate student at the Sixth Research Laboratory who is concerned about the potential leak of their 'Submarine' game to Unlimited Planning.,2\n292,NAGATA,Nagata is a student from the Third Research Laboratory who noticed the similarity between 'Marine Crash' and 'Submarine' and brought it to the attention of the Sixth Research Laboratory.,2\n307,内藤,内藤是正晴的朋友，同时也是冰球社的学弟，比正晴低一届。他在吉田公寓事件中提供了相关信息，并陪同正晴与田川进行了交流。内藤与正晴的关系既包含朋友间的互助，也有社团前后辈之间的互动，展现了他在事件中的参与和支持角色。,3\n311,东成区,\"东成区是深江桥所在的区域，同时也是田川不动产的另一分店所在地，并与生野区存在一定的关联。该区域既以交通基础设施（深江桥）为标志，又与商业活动（田川不动产分店）及邻近行政区（生野区）有联系，体现了其多元化的功能与地理特征。  \n\n（注：两段描述无矛盾，故整合为连贯信息，总字数符合要求。）\",2\n290,SIXTH RESEARCH LABORATORY,The Sixth Research Laboratory is part of the Faculty of Engineering at North Osaka University where Zheng Qing and his colleagues work on their research and develop games like 'Submarine'.,2\n315,丰田卡瑞那,丰田卡瑞那是内藤驾驶的汽车品牌,1\n312,阪神高速公路东大阪线高井田交流道,阪神高速公路东大阪线高井田交流道是田川不动产深江桥店附近的地标,1\n291,THIRD RESEARCH LABORATORY,The Third Research Laboratory is another research group at North Osaka University where students like Nagata are involved in similar projects.,1\n301,石油危机,\"The oil crisis period referenced in the historical news reports\"\"\",2\n302,《大气污染防治法》,\"A revised law passed in May 1974, mentioned in the news reports\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n436,正晴,唐泽雪穗,\"**正晴** has complex feelings toward **唐泽雪穗**, encompassing both suspicion and guilt over doubting her.

However, there are conflicting claims regarding the origins of the SUBMARINE program. One source suggests that the program was leaked to 无限企划 (\"\"The 'Submarine' program was allegedly leaked to '无限企划'\"\"), while another alleges that 无限企划 may have plagiarized or misappropriated the SUBMARINE program (“无限企划”涉嫌剽窃“Submarine”程序).  \n\nTo reconcile these contradictions, it appears that SUBMARINE is closely tied to 无限企划, either as a key product developed by the company or as a program acquired or appropriated through disputed means. The exact nature of 无限企划's relationship with SUBMARINE remains unclear, with competing narratives suggesting either legitimate ownership or questionable acquisition. Further clarification would be needed to determine whether the program was internally developed, leaked externally, or improperly taken from another source.  \n\nIn summary, 无限企划 is prominently linked to SUBMARINE, but the circumstances surrounding its association are subject to conflicting claims, ranging from legitimate product development to allegations of plagiarism or unauthorized acquisition.\",14\n159,田川不动产,田川敏夫,田川敏夫是田川不动产的员工,10\n392,SUBMARINE,MARINE CRASH,Marine Crash是Submarine游戏的名称,9\n432,MARINE CRASH,SUBMARINE,\"'Marine Crash' is very similar to the 'Submarine' game, suggesting possible plagiarism\",9\n453,田川,深江桥,田川在深江桥经营另一家不动产店,8\n434,美浓部,中道,美浓部 is questioning 中道 about the possible leak of the 'Submarine' program,6\n435,美浓部,第六研究室,美浓部 gathers the team at 第六研究室 to investigate the leak,6\n426,UNLIMITED PLANNING,MINOBU,Minobu suspects that someone from their research group leaked the 'Submarine' game to Unlimited Planning.,5\n427,UNLIMITED PLANNING,NAGATA,Nagata discovered the similarity between 'Marine Crash' and 'Submarine' and alerted the Sixth Research Laboratory.,5\n447,内藤,冰球社,内藤是冰球社现任成员,5\n456,深江桥,东成区,深江桥位于东成区,5\n429,SIXTH RESEARCH LABORATORY,MINOBU,Minobu is a graduate student working in the Sixth Research Laboratory.,4\n448,内藤,丰田卡瑞那,内藤驾驶丰田卡瑞那汽车,4\n457,深江桥,阪神高速公路东大阪线高井田交流道,深江桥店位于阪神高速公路东大阪线高井田交流道旁,4\n431,THIRD RESEARCH LABORATORY,NAGATA,Nagata is a student from the Third Research Laboratory.,3\n443,石油危机,《大气污染防治法》,The oil crisis influenced environmental legislation like 《大气污染防治法》,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
