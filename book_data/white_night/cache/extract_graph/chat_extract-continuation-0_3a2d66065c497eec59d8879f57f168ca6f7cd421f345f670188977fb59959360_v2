“好，那没有别的了。今晚，我会跟他告别。你们走吧。明天这个时候，来接我。”说完这句话，娜娜直接将门关了起来。\n\n    看着面前关闭的房门，云琰不禁有些尴尬，扭头看向预备战神。\n\n    预备战神向她点了点头，率先转身走了出去。\n\n    云琰赶忙跟上他，低声道：“你说，娜娜会不会反悔啊？”\n\n    预备战神摇摇头，“应该不会，到了她这种层次，定要知行合一，否则会乱了自己的心神，影响到修为。我们先回去向上面汇报。云研究员，你赶快联系你们研究所的飞船，明天我们直接返回天斗星。”\n\n    “哦，好。”云琰点点头，也有些如释重负。\n\n    “云研究员，你知道娜娜冕下究竟是什么修为吗？”预备战神突然问道。\n\n    “啊？不知道啊！当初检测的时候，并没有发现她体内有能量出现，只是觉得她是一个非常健康的普通女性而已。”云琰也是一脸的苦恼。\n\n    预备战神的表情顿时变得古怪起来，普通女性？普通女性看自己一眼就能让自己精神差点崩溃？普通女性能举手投足之间将已经加速到超音速的战舰击毁？她要是普通女性，这世界上还有普通二字存在的意义吗？\n\n    回到房间，娜娜默默的坐在沙发上。一种怅然若失的情绪没来由的弥漫在心头。\n\n    自从苏醒之后，她就一直处于一种浑浑噩噩的状态，几年时间过去，对她来说却如弹指一瞬，并没有留下什么深刻的印象。\n\n    直到见到蓝轩宇，不知道为什么，第一眼见到他的时候，他就如同一块磁石般深深的吸引着她。那种感觉是非常奇妙的，甚至有些难以形容。或许，这就是缘分吧。\n\n    现在终究还是要离开了，娜娜知道，如果自己继续留下来，带给蓝轩宇的麻烦肯定会远远多于帮助。他毕竟是有父母在的，自己终究只是个外人。\n\n    只是，理智是一回事儿，真正去做就又是另外一回事儿了。她突然有了一种情绪，不舍！\n\n    见到他的时候，该怎么对他说呢？以他的性格，一定会眼巴巴的看着自己，甚至抱着自己的大腿，眼圈一定会泛红，甚至会流着泪不让自己走。\n\n    那个时候，自己真的能硬起心肠就这么离开吗？\n\n    突然之间，一种刺痛在心底蔓延，娜娜突然吃惊地发现，如果真的遇到那样的情况，说不定，自己会不顾一切的留下来。无论是面对什么。\n\n    可是，她当然不怕面对什么，两世为人，甚至已经忘却一世\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
