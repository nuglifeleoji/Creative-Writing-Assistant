�腼腆腆，心胆倒挺大！哼，她凭什么能看上个孙少安？而且还敢在光天化日下坐在村外面谈恋爱哩！他现在才知道，润叶这几次回家来，慌慌乱乱，心神不定，动不动就跑出去了——原来她这都是为了孙玉厚那个大小子啊！ \n　　不行！他就是寻死上吊，也不会同意让他的女儿进了孙玉厚的家门！虽说现在兴男女婚姻自由，但不能自由得没框没架，没棱没沿嘛！别说是真的进了孙家的门，就是他的工作女儿和一个泥腿把子谈恋爱这件事，若是让村邻乡舍都知道，他田福堂的脸都没处搁。 \n　　他要很快制止这件丑事继续发展。当然，他是个精明人，也不愿伤自己娃娃的脸。因此自发生这件事后，一直装得和不知道一样…… \n　　女儿回县城已经三天了，现在田福堂的心情还平静不下来。这几天他已经没心思管村里的工作，日夜盘算润叶和少安的事。 \n　　他有时也豁达地想，如果少安当年不要回来劳动，和润叶一块去上学，再寻个工作，那这娃娃做他的女婿说不定还可以。少安本人他看上哩！要是文化再高一点，又有工作，说不定将来还能熬个大官……反过来再说，要是他女儿没文化没工作，也在双水村劳动，农民对农民，那不要他孙少安骚情，他田福堂会直接找媒人把润叶许配给他的。当然，如果是这样，他也就不会嫌孙玉厚家穷了，到时候他会把少安的光景扶起来的：没地方住吗？他给箍两孔新窑！没吃的吗？到他家里来吃！ \n　　可是，现在明摆着，两个人的条件差得太远嘛！ \n　　他想，孙少安这小子也不知道个天高地厚！你不在东拉河里照照你的影子，看能不能配上我润叶？你胡骚情我女儿，最后就是落了空，你除损失不了什么，还能抬高你的身价哩！可你等于给我田福堂祖坟供桌上撒了一泡尿！活活地往死欺负人哩！哼！你小子甭能！我田福堂也不是个省油的灯盏！ \n　　田福堂跹蹴在自家的炕头上，一边想，一边气得鼻子口里喷着热气。他老婆以为他病了，给他拌了一碗鸡蛋糊汤端在面前，他一口也不吃，也不给他老婆说他究竟怎么了，只是手里拿一根纸烟，不断凑到鼻子上闻。 \n　　他突然想到，他应该去一趟城里！他要找福军和爱云，让他两个赶快给润叶在城里瞅个人家。他以前只是一般地给他两个安咐了这件事，这次他要把这当个事好好给福军和爱云说一说。 \n　　想到这里，他性急地立马跳下了炕，准备先去找一下孙玉�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂 is a father concerned about his daughter 润叶's
