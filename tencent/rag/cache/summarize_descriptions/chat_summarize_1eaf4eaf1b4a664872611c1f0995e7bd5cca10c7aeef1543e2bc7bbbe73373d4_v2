The ship's advanced systems include filtered and recycled air to sustain its occupants in a controlled environment.  \n\nDuncan Idaho is a primary detainee aboard the NO-SHIP, where he is closely monitored. The vessel also functions as a research facility for studying its own unique no-ship capabilities, which likely involve stealth or evasion technologies.
