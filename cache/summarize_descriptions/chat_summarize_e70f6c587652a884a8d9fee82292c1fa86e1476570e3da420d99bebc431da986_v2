This trance unlocks profound mental and spiritual experiences, including vivid visions of the future, glimpses into ancestral memories, and heightened awareness of inner conflicts. The state is particularly perilous for the *pre-born*—individuals exposed to *melange* in utero—as their undeveloped minds may be overwhelmed by the intensity of the visions and memories.  \n\nThe trance serves as a conduit for both prescience and introspection, revealing hidden truths and potential timelines. However, its dangers are significant, as the influx of ancestral knowledge and future glimpses can destabilize the psyche, especially in those not fully prepared for such revelations. The *spice trance* is thus a double-edged phenomenon: a tool for enlightenment and a potential source of madness.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize different aspects—one focusing on the visionary and conflict-revealing nature, the other on ancestral memory and risks to the *pre-born*—they align in portraying the *spice trance* as a transformative yet hazardous experience tied to *melange* consumption.
