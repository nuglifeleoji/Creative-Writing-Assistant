The wedding must be managed with utmost care. It must have the precision of which only you are capable.”\n“Where, Lord?”\nA bit more life in his voice.\n“At Tabur Village in the Sareer.”\n“When?”\n“Į leave the date to you. Announce it when all things are arranged.”\n“And the ceremony itself?”\n“I will conduct it.”\n“Will you need assistants, Lord? Artifacts of any kind?”\n“The trappings of ritual?”\n“Any particular thing which | may not...”\n“We will not need much for our little charade.”\n“Lord! | beg of you! Please...”\n“You will stand beside the bride and give her in marriage,” Leto said. “We will use the Old Fremen ritual.”\n“We will need water rings then,” Moneo said.\n“Yes! | will use Ghani’s water rings.”\n“And who will attend, Lord?”\n“Only a Fish Speaker guard and the aristocracy.”\nMoneo stared at Leto’s face. “What... what does my Lord mean by ‘aristocracy’?”\n“You, your family, the household entourage, the courtiers of the Citadel.”\n“My fam...” Moneo swallowed. “Do you include Siona?” “If she survives the test.” “But sa ve\n“Is she not family?”\n“Of course, Lord. She is Atreides and...”\n“Then by all means include Siona!”\nMoneo brought a tiny memocorder from his pocket, a dull black Ixian artifact whose existence crowded the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad. A soft smile touched Leto’s lips. Moneo knew his duties and would now perform them.\nThe clamor of Duncan Idaho outside the portal grew more strident, but Moneo ignored the sound.\nMoneo knows the price of his privileges, Leto thought. /t is another kind of marriage—the marriage of privilege and\nduty. It is the aristocrat’s explanation and his excuse.\nMoneo finished his note taking.\n“A few details, Lord,” Moneo said. “Will there be some special garb for Hwi?”\n“The stillsuit and robe of a Fremen bride, real ones.”\n“Jewelry or other baubles?”\nLeto’s gaze locked on Moneo’s fingers scrabbling over the tiny recorder, seeing there a dissolution.\nLeadership, courage, a sense of knowledge and order— Moneo has these in abundance. They surround him like a holy aura, but they conceal from all eyes except mine the rot which eats from within. It is inevitable. Were | gone, it would be visible to everyone.\n“Lord?” Moneo pressed. “Are you woolgathering?”\nAhhh! He likes that word!\n“That is all,” Leto said. “Only the robe, the stillsuit and the water rings.”\nMoneo bowed and turned away.\nHe is looking ahead now, Leto thought, but even this new thing will pass. He will turn toward the past once more. And | had such high hopes for him once. Well... perhaps Siona...\n“Make no heroes,” my father said.\n—THE VOICE OF GHANIMA, FROM THE ORAL HISTORY\nust by the way Idaho strode across the small chamber, his\nloud demands for audience now gratified, Leto could see an important transformation in the ghola. It was a thing repeated so many times that it had become deeply familiar to Leto. The Duncan had not even exchanged words of greeting with the departing Moneo. It all fitted into the pattern. How boring that pattern had become!\nLeto had a name for this transformation of the Duncans. He called it “The Since Syndrome.”\nThe gholas often nurtured suspicions about the secret things which might have been developed across the centuries of oblivion since they last knew awareness. What had people been doing all that time? Why could they possibly want me, this relic from their past? No ego could overcome such doubts forever—especially in a doubting man.\nOne of the gholas had accused Leto: “You’ve put things in my body, things | know nothing about! These things in my body tell you everything I’m doing! You spy on me everywhere!”\nAnother had charged him with possessing a “manipulative machine which makes us want to do whatever you want.”\nOnce it started, the Since Syndrome could never be entirely eliminated. It could be checked, even diverted, but the dormant seed might sprout at the slightest provocation.\nIdaho stopped where Moneo had stood and there was a veiled look of nonspecific suspicions in his eyes, in the set of his shoulders. Leto allowed the situation to simmer, bringing the condition to a head. Idaho locked gazes with him, then broke away to dart his glances around the room. Leto recognized the manner behind the gaze.\nThe Duncans never forget!\nAs he studied the room, using the sightful ways he had been taught centuries before by the Lady Jessica and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, Idaho began to feel a giddy sense of dislocation. He thought the room rejected him, each thing— the soft cushions: big bulbous things in gold, green anda red that was almost purple; the Fremen rugs, each a museum piece, lapping over each other in thick piles around Leto’s pit; the false sunlight of Ixian glowglobes, light which enveloped the Emperor’s face in dry warmth, making the shadows around it deeper and more mysterious; the smell of spice-tea somewhere nearby; and that rich melange odor which radiated from the worm-body.\nIdaho felt that too much had happened to him too fast since the Tleilaxu had abandoned him to the mercies of Luli and Friend in that featureless prison-cell room.\nToo much...too much...\nAm I really here? he wondered. /s this me? What are these thoughts that | think?\nHe stared at Leto’s quiescent body, the shadowy and enormous mass which lay so silently there on its cart within the pit. The very quietness of that fleshly mass only suggested mysterious energies, terrible energies which might be unleashed in ways nobody could anticipate.\nIdaho had heard the stories about the fight at the Ixian Embassy, but the Fish Speaker accounts had an aura of miraculous visitation about them which obscured the physical data.\n“He flew down from above them and executed a terrible slaughter among the sinners.”\n“How did he do that?” Idaho had asked.\n“He was an angry God,” his informant had said.\nAngry, Idaho thought. Was it because of the threat to Hwi? The stories he had heard! None were believable. Hwi wedded to this gross... It was not possible! Not the lovely Hwi, the Hwi of gentle delicacy. He is playing some terrible game, testing us... testing us... There was no honest reality in these times, no peace except in the presence of Hwi. All else was insanity.\nAs he returned his attention to Leto’s face—that silently waiting Atreides face—the sense of dislocation grew stronger in Idaho. He began to wonder if, by a slight increase in mental effort along some strange new pathway, he might break through ghostly barriers to remember all of the experiences of the other Ghola Idahos.\nWhat did they think when they entered this room? Did they feel this dislocation, this rejection?\nJust a little extra effort.\nHe felt dizzy and wondered if he was going to faint.\n“Is something wrong, Duncan?” It was Leto’s most reasonable and calming tone.\n“It’s not real,” Idaho said. “I don’t belong here.”\nLeto chose to misunderstand. “But my guard tells me you came here of your own accord, that you flew back from the Citadel and demanded an immediate audience.”\n“I mean here, now! In this time!”\n“But | need you.”\n“For what?”\n“Look around you, Duncan. The ways you can help me are so numerous that you could not do them all.”\n“But your women won't let me fight! Every time | want to go where...”\n“Do you question that you’re more valuable alive than dead?” Leto made a clucking sound, then: “Use your wits, Duncan! That’s what | value.”\n“And my sperm. You value that.”\n“Your sperm is your own to put where you wish.”\n“I will not leave a widow and orphans behind me the way...”\n“Duncan! I’ve said the choice is yours.”\nIdaho swallowed, then: “You’ve committed a crime against us, Leto, against all of us—the gholas you resurrect without ever asking us if that’s what we want.”\nThis was a new turn in Duncan-thinking. Leto peered at Idaho with renewed interest.\n“What crime?”\n“Oh, I’ve heard you spouting your deep thoughts,” Idaho accused. He hooked a thumb over his shoulder, pointing at the room’s entrance. “Did you know you can be heard out there in the anteroom?”\n“When I wish to be heard, yes.” But only my journals hear it all! “| would like to know the nature of my crime, though.” “There’s a time, Leto, a time when you’re alive. A time when you’re supposed to be alive. It can have a magic, that time, while you’re living it. You know you’re never going to\nsee a time like that again.”\nLeto blinked, touched by the Duncan’s distress. The words were evocative.\nIdaho raised both hands, palms up, to chest-height, a beggar asking for something he knew he could not receive.\n“Then... one day you wake up and you remember dying... and you remember the axlotl tank... and the Tleilaxu nastiness which awakened you... and it’s Supposed to start all over again. But it doesn’t. It never does, Leto. That’s a crime!”\n“I have taken away the magic?”\n“Yes!”\nIdaho dropped his hands to his sides and clenched them into fists. He felt that he stood alone in the path of a millrace tide which would overwhelm him at his slightest relaxation.\nAnd what of my time? Leto thought. This, too, will never happen again. But the Duncan would not understand the difference.\n“What brought you rushing back from the Citadel?” Leto asked.\nIdaho took a deep breath, then: “Is it true? You’re to be married?”\n“That’s correct.”\n“To this Hwi Noree, the Ixian Ambassador?”\n“True.”\nIdaho darted a quick glance along Leto’s supine length.\nThey always look for genitalia, Leto thought. Perhaps | should have something made, a gross protuberance to shock them. He choked back the small burst of amusement which threatened to erupt from his throat. Another emotion amplified. Thank you, Hwi. Thank you, Ixians.\nIdaho shook his head. “But you.. .”\n“There are strong elements to a marriage other than sex,” Leto said. “Will we have children of our flesh? No. But the effects of this union will be profound.”\n“I listened while you were talking to Moneo,” Idaho said. “I thought it must be some kind of joke,a.. .”\n“Careful, Duncan!”\n“Do you Jove her?”\n“More deeply than any man ever loved a woman.”\n“Well, what about her? Does she...”\n“She feels ... a compelling compassion, a need to share with me, to give whatever she can give. It is her nature.”\nIdaho suppressed a feeling of revulsion.\n“Moneo’s right. They'll believe the Tleilaxu stories.”\n“That is one of the profound effects.”\n“And you still want me to... to mate with Siona!”\n“You know my wishes. | leave the choice to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TABUR VILLAGE<|>GEO<|>Tabur Village is the location where the wedding will take place in the Sareer region\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAREE<|>GEO<|>Sareer is the region where Tabur Village is located\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the God Emperor who will conduct the wedding ceremony and has significant influence over the events and people involved\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is a trusted aide to Leto, responsible for managing the wedding details and other administrative tasks\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANI<|>PERSON<|>Ghani is mentioned in relation to water rings that will be used in the wedding ceremony\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a member of Moneo's family and an Atreides, whose inclusion in the wedding is conditional on her survival\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>PERSON<|>Hwi Noree is the Ixian Ambassador and the bride in the wedding, who will wear a Fremen stillsuit and robe\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a ghola with a complex relationship with Leto, expressing doubts and suspicions about his role and existence\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speaker guard is an organization that will attend the wedding\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Citadel is the location where courtiers and the aristocracy reside, some of whom will attend the wedding\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IXIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ixian is referenced in relation to artifacts like the memocorder and glowglobes, and Hwi Noree is the Ixian Ambassador\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>The Butlerian Jihad is a historical event that proscribed certain technologies, like the Ixian memocorder\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEDDING<|>EVENT<|>The wedding is the central event being planned, involving Leto and Hwi Noree, with Old Fremen rituals\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>MONEO<|>Leto relies on Moneo to manage the wedding details and other administrative tasks<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>HWI NOREE<|>Leto is deeply in love with Hwi Noree and is marrying her, which will have profound effects<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>SIONA<|>Moneo is related to Siona as family, and her inclusion in the wedding is conditional<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>LETO<|>Duncan Idaho has a complex relationship with Leto, expressing doubts and suspicions about his role and existence<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HWI NOREE<|>IXIAN<|>Hwi Noree is the Ixian Ambassador, representing the Ixian organization<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEDDING<|>TABUR VILLAGE<|>The wedding will take place at Tabur Village in the Sareer region<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEDDING<|>OLD FREMEN RITUAL<|>The wedding will use the Old Fremen ritual, including water rings and stillsuits<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>FISH SPEAKER<|>The Fish Speaker guard will attend the wedding, under Leto's command<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>CITADEL<|>The aristocracy from the Citadel will attend the wedding, as per Leto's instructions<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SIONA<|>Leto wishes Duncan Idaho to mate with Siona, though the choice is left to him<|>5\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
