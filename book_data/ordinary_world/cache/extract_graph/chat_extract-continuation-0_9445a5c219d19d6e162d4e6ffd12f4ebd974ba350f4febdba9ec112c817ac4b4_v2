�黑暗的墙根，又返回到了大桥头。这大桥无形中已经成了他的“家”。现在，揽活的人大部分都离开了这里，街头的人行道被小摊贩们占据了。 \n　　他走到桥中央，伏在水泥桥栏杆上，望着满河流泻的灯火，心绪象一团乱麻。他现在集中精力考虑他到什么地方去度过这个夜晚。 \n　　他突然想起，离家时父亲曾告诉过他，黄原城有他舅一个叔叔的儿子，住在北关的阳沟大队，有什么事可以去找他。尽管这亲戚关系很远，但总算还能扯上一点，比找纯粹的生人要强。要不要去找这位远亲舅舅呢？ \n　　但少平想，他人生路不熟，得边走边打听，赶天明都不一定能找见这家亲戚。 \n　　他简直走投无路了。现在才是古历四月初，天气仍然不暖和；尤其是夜间，还相当冷。要不，他可以到周围的山野里去度过这一夜，街头上更不能过夜。万一让警察带走，会急忙说不下个明白的。而这城里的熟人他又不愿意去找啊…… \n　　他猛然想起了一个半生不熟的人：贾冰。 \n　　是的，或许可以去找他？贾老师是个诗人，说不定他会更理解人，而不至于笑话他的处境。他那年来黄原讲故事。和晓霞一块跟着当时的县文化馆杜馆长，应邀去贾老师家吃过一顿饭。记得他们家有好几孔窑洞。说不定能在那里凑合几个晚上呢！只要晚上有个住处，白天他就可以到大桥头来找活；只要找下活干，起码吃住就有了着落。 \n　　这么想的时候，孙少平已经起身往贾冰家走了。 \n　　贾冰家在南关一个小土坡上，他不一会就到了。 \n　　他刚一进贾冰家的院子，一条大黑狗“汪”一声窜了出来，他吓得往旁边一跳，把手里的黄提包象手榴弹一样向狗扔去。 \n　　“男爵！”有人从窑里喊了一声，紧接着便走出窑洞来。少平一眼认出这就是贾老师。 \n　　“男爵，回去！”贾冰对狗说。那位张牙舞爪的“男爵”便向旁边的窝里悻悻而去。 \n　　贾冰走过来，看定他，问：“你找谁？” \n　　贾老师显然已经不认识他了。 \n　　“贾老师，我是孙少平……”他谦恭地说。 \n　　“孙少平？” \n　　贾老师仍然想不起来他是谁。 \n　　是的，他太平凡了。那年仅仅一面之交，还是杜馆长带着，人家怎么可能记住他呢？ \n　　“那年地区故事调讲会，我跟杜馆长来过你们家。我是原西县石圪节公社双水村的……”少平竭力提示贾老师，以便让他能想起他来。 \n　　“噢……”贾冰看来有点印象。 \n　　孙少平立刻用简短的话说明他的卑微的来意。 \n　　“�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>贾冰<|>PERSON<|>贾冰 is a poet who lives in Huangyuan and has previously
