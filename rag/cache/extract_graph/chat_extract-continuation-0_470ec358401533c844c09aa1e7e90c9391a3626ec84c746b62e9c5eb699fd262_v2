Sinister imaginings can destroy us.\nHow easy it was to conjure a future that looked at them from glazing orange eyes of berserk Honored Matres. Fears out of many pasts crouched within Odrade, breathless moments focused on fangs that went with such eyes.\nOdrade forced her attention back to the immediate problem. “Who will accompany me to Junction?”\nThey knew Dortujla’s harrowing experience and word of it had spread throughout Chapterhouse.\n“Whoever goes with Mother Superior could well be fed to Futars.”\n“Tam,” Odrade said. “You and Dortujla.” And that may be a death sentence. The next step is obvious. “Sheeana,” Odrade said, “you will Share with Tam. Dortujla and | will Share with Bell. And | also will share with you before | go.”\nBellonda was aghast. “Mother Superior! | am not suited to take your place.”\nOdrade held her attention on Sheeana. “That is not being suggested. | will merely make you the repository of my lives.” Definite fear on Sheeana’s face but she dared not refuse a direct order. Odrade nodded to Tamalane. “I will Share later. You and Sheeana will do it now.”\nTamalane leaned toward Sheeana. The strictures of great age and imminent death made this a welcome thing for her but Sheeana involuntarily pulled away.\n“Now!” Odrade said. Let Tam judge whatever it is you hide.\nThere was no escape. Sheeana bent her head to Tamalane’s until they touched. The flash of the exchange was electric and the entire dining room felt it. Conversation stopped, every gaze turned toward the table by the window.\nThere were tears in Sheeana’s eyes when she withdrew.\nTamalane smiled and made a gentle caressing motion with both hands along Sheeana’s cheeks. “It’s all right, dear. We all have these fears and sometimes do foolish things because of them. But | am pleased to call you Sister.”\nTell us, Tam! Now!\nTamalane did not choose to do that. She faced Odrade and said, “We must cling to our humanity at any cost. Your lesson is well received and you have taught Sheeana well.”\n“When Sheeana Shares with you, Dar,” Bellonda began, “could you not reduce the influence she has on Idaho?”\n“I will not weaken a possible Mother Superior,” Odrade said. “Thank you, Tam. | think we will make our venture to Junction without excess baggage. Now! | want a report by tonight on Teg’s progress. His leech has been too long away from him.”\n“Will he learn that he has two leeches now?” Sheeana asked. Such joy in her!\nOdrade stood.\nIf Tam accepts her then I must. Tam would never betray our Sisterhood. And Sheeana—of us all, Sheeana most reveals the natural traits from our human roots. Still... 1 wish she had never created that statue she calls “The Void.”\nReligion must be accepted as a source of energy. It can be directed for our purposes, but only within limits that experience reveals. Here is the secret meaning of Free Will.\n—MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA, PRIMARY TEACHING\nthick cloud cover had moved over Central this morning\nand Odrade’s workroom took on a gray silence to which she felt herself responding with inner stillness, as though she dared not move because that disturbed dangerous forces.\nMurbella’s day of Agony, she thought. / must not think of omens.\nWeather had issued a peremptory warning about clouds. They were an accidental displacement. Corrective measures were being taken but would require time. Meanwhile, expect high winds, and there could be precipitation.\nSheeana and Tamalane stood at the window looking at this poorly controlled weather. Their shoulders touched.\nOdrade watched them from her chair behind the table. Those two had become like a single person since yesterday’s Sharing, not an unexpected occurrence. Precedents were known, although not many of them. Exchanges, occurring in the presence of poisonous spicy essence or at an actual moment of death, did not often allow further living contact between participants. It was interesting to observe. The two backs were oddly alike in their rigidity.\nThe force of extremis that made Sharing possible dictated powerful changes in personality and Odrade knew this with an intimacy that compelled tolerance. Whatever it was\nSheeana concealed, Tam also concealed. Something tied to Sheeana’s basic humanity. And Tam could be trusted. Until another Sister Shared with one of them, Tam’s judgment must be accepted. Not that watchdogs would cease probing and observing minutiae but they needed no new crisis just now.\n“This is Murbella’s day,” Odrade said.\n“The odds are long she won’t survive,” Bellonda said, hunched forward in her chairdog. “What happens to our precious plan then?”\nOur plan!\n“Extremis,” Odrade said.\nIn that context, it was a word with several meanings. Bellonda interpreted it as a possibility of acquiring Murbella’s persona-memories at the moment of her death. “Then we must not permit Idaho to observe!”\n“My order stands,” Odrade said. “It’s Murbella’s wish and | have given my word.”\n“Mistake... mistake...” Bellonda muttered.\nOdrade knew the source of Bellonda’s doubts. Visible to all of them: Somewhere in Murbella lay something extremely painful. It caused her to shy away from certain questions like an animal confronted by a predator. Whatever it was, the thing went deep. Hypnotrance induction might not explain it.\n“All right!” Odrade spoke loudly to emphasize it was for all of her listeners. “It’s not the way we've ever done it before. But we cannot take Duncan from the ship so we must go to him. He will be present.”\nBellonda was still well and truly shocked. No man, barring the damned Kwisatz Haderach himself and his Tyrant son, had ever known the particulars of this Bene Gesserit secret. Both of those monsters had felt the Agony. Two disasters! No matter that the Tyrant’s Agony had worked its way inward a cell at a time to transform him into a sandworm symbiote (no more original worm, no more original human).\nAnd Muad’Dib! He dared the Agony and look what came of that!\nSheeana turned from the window and took one step toward the table, giving Odrade the curious feeling that the two women standing there had become a Janus figure: back to back but only one persona.\n“Bell is confused by your promise,” Sheeana said. How soft her voice.\n“He could be the catalyst to pull Murbella through,” Odrade said. “You tend to underestimate the power of love.”\n“No!” Tamalane spoke to the window in front of her. “We fear its power.”\n“Could be!” Bell still was scornful but that came naturally to her. The expression on her face said she remained implacably stubborn.\n“Hubris,” Sheeana murmured.\n“What?” Bellonda whirled in her chairdog, causing it to squeak with indignation.\n“We share a common failing with Scytale,” Sheeana said.\n“Oh?” Bellonda was gnawing at Sheeana’s secret.\n“We think we make history,” Sheeana said. She returned to her position beside Tamalane, both of them staring out the window.\nBellonda returned her attention to Odrade. “Do you understand that?”\nOdrade ignored her. Let the Mentat work it out for herself. The projector on the worktable clicked and a message was displayed. Odrade reported it. “Still not ready at the ship.” She looked at those two rigid backs in front of the window.\nHistory?\nOn Chapterhouse, there had been little of what Odrade liked to think of as history-making before the Honored Matres. Only the steady graduation of Reverend Mothers passing through the Agony.\nLike a river.\nIt flowed and it went somewhere. You could stand on the bank (as Odrade sometimes thought they did here) and you could observe the flow. A map might tell you where the river went but no map could reveal more essential things. A map could never show intimate movements of the river’s cargo. Where did they go? Maps had limited value in this age. A printout or projection from Archives; that was not the map they required. There had to be a better one somewhere, one attached to all of those lives. You could carry that map in your memory and have it out occasionally for a closer look.\nWhatever happened to the Reverend Mother Perinte we sent out last year?\nThe map-in-the-mind would take over and create a “Perinte Scenario.” It was really yourself on the river, of course, but this made little difference. It still was the map they needed.\nWe don't like it that we're caught in someone else’s currents, that we don’t know what may be revealed at the river’s next bend. We always prefer overflight even though any commanding position must remain part of other currents. Every flow contains unpredictable things.\nOdrade looked up to see her three companions watching her. Tamalane and Sheeana had turned their backs to the window.\n“Honored Matres have forgotten that clinging to any form of conservatism can be dangerous,” Odrade said. “Have we forgotten it as well?”\nThey continued to stare at her but they had heard. Become too conservative and you were unprepared for surprises. That was what Muad’Dib had taught them, and his Tyrant son had made the lesson forever unforgettable.\nBellonda’s glum expression did not change.\nIn the deep recesses of Odrade’s consciousness, Taraza whispered: “Careful, Dar. | was lucky. Quick to grab advantage. Just as you are. But you cannot depend on luck and that is what bothers them. Don’t even expect luck.\nMuch better to trust your water images. Let Bell have her Say.” “Bell,” Odrade said, “I thought you accepted Duncan.”\n“Within limits.” Definitely accusatory.\n“I think we should go out to the ship.” Sheeana spoke with demanding emphasis. “This is not the place to wait. Do we fear what she may become?”\nTam and Sheeana turned toward the door simultaneously as though the same puppet master controlled their strings.\nOdrade found the interruption welcome. Sheeana’s question alarmed them. What could Murbella become? A catalyst, my Sisters. A catalyst.\nThe wind shook them when they emerged from Central and for once Odrade was thankful for tube transport. Walking could await warmer temperatures without this blustering mini-tempest tugging at their robes.\nWhen they were seated in a private car, Bellonda once more took up her accusatory refrain. “Everything he does could be camouflage.”\nOnce more, Odrade voiced the oft-repeated Bene Gesserit warning to limit their reliance on Mentats. “Logic is blind and often knows only its own past.”\nTamalane chimed in with unexpected support. “You are getting paranoid, Bell!”\nSheeana spoke more softly. “I’ve heard you say, Bell, that logic is good for playing pyramid chess but often too slow for needs of survival.”\nBellonda sat in glowering silence, only a faint hissing rumble of their tube passage intruding on the quiet.\nWounds must not be taken into the ship.\nOdrade matched her tone to Sheeana’s: “Bell, dear Bell. We do not have time to consider all ramifications of our plight. We no\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, making key decisions and leading the group in critical situations\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a Bene Gesserit Sister with significant influence, known for her humanity and connection to the sandworms\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TAMALANE<|>PERSON<|>Tamalane is an elder Bene Gesserit Sister who participates in Sharing and advises Odrade\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Sister and a Mentat, often skeptical and cautious in her approach\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is undergoing the Agony, a transformative Bene Gesserit ritual, with uncertain survival prospects\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a key figure with ties to the Bene Gesserit, involved in their plans and rituals\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapterhouse is the home planet of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, where many critical events unfold\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JUNCTION<|>GEO<|>Junction is a destination for Odrade and her companions, possibly a strategic location\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL<|>GEO<|>Central is a place on Chapterhouse where Odrade and others conduct their work and discussions\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location where Samuel Namara was held, mentioned in passing\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful and secretive sisterhood with deep political and religious influence\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a feared and aggressive group opposing the Bene Gesserit\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Missionaria Protectiva is a Bene Gesserit organization focused on religious manipulation\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AGONY<|>EVENT<|>The Agony is a transformative and often deadly Bene Gesserit ritual, currently being undergone by Murbella\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHARING<|>EVENT<|>Sharing is a Bene Gesserit ritual where memories and experiences are exchanged between Sisters\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading the organization<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>TAMALANE<|>Sheeana and Tamalane Shared memories, creating a deep bond between them<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade trusts Sheeana as a potential successor and shares knowledge with her<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MURBELLA<|>Odrade oversees Murbella's Agony and has a vested interest in her survival<|>6\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>AGONY<|>Murbella is undergoing the Agony, a critical and dangerous ritual<|>9\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Duncan Idaho is closely tied to the Bene Gesserit's plans and rituals<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>ODRADE<|>Bellonda often challenges Odrade's decisions but remains loyal to the Bene Gesserit<|>5\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Honored Matres are a direct threat to the Bene Gesserit<|>8\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Sheeana is a prominent member of the Bene Gesserit with unique influence<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TAMALANE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Tamalane is a senior member of the Bene Gesserit, advising Odrade<|>7\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Chapterhouse is the home planet and stronghold of the Bene Gesserit<|>9\")  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
