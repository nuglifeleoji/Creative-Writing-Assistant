安忍便议亲？”范曰：“人若无妻，如屋无梁，岂可中道而废人伦？吾主吴侯有一妹，美而贤，堪奉箕帚。若两家共结秦、晋之好，则曹贼不敢正视东南也。此事家国两便，请皇叔勿疑。但我国太吴夫人甚爱幼女，不肯远嫁，必求皇叔到东吴就婚。”玄德曰：“此事吴侯知否？”范曰：“不先禀吴侯，如何敢造次来说！”玄德曰：“吾年已半百，鬓发斑白；吴侯之妹，正当妙龄：恐非配偶。”范曰：“吴侯之妹，身虽女子，志胜男儿。常言：若非天下英雄，吾不事之。今皇叔名闻四海，正所谓淑女配君子，岂以年齿上下相嫌乎！”玄德曰：“公且少留，来日回报。”是日设宴相待，留于馆舍。\n\n    至晚，与孔明商议。孔明曰：“来意亮已知道了。适间卜易，得一大吉大利之兆。主公便可应允。先教孙乾和吕范回见吴侯，面许已定，择日便去就亲。”玄德曰：“周瑜定计欲害刘备，岂可以身轻入危险之地？”孔明大笑曰：“周瑜虽能用计，岂能出诸葛亮之料乎！略用小谋，使周瑜半筹不展；吴侯之妹，又属主公；荆州万无一失。”玄德怀疑未决。\n\n    孔明竟教孙乾往江南说合亲事。孙乾领了言语，与吕范同到江南，来见孙权。权曰：“吾愿将小妹招赘玄德，并无异心。”孙乾拜谢，回荆州见玄德，言：“吴侯专候主公去结亲。”玄德怀疑不敢往。孔明曰：“吾已定下三条计策，非子龙不可行也。”遂唤赵云近前，附耳言曰：“汝保主公入吴，当领此三个锦囊。囊中有三条妙计，依次而行。”即将三个锦囊，与云贴肉收藏，孔明先使人往东吴纳了聘，一切完备。\n\n    时建安十四年冬十月。玄德与赵长、孙乾取快船十只，随行五百余人，离了荆州，前往南徐进发。荆州之事，皆听孔明裁处。玄德心中怏怏不安。到南徐州，船已傍岸，云曰：“军师分付三条妙计，依次而行。今已到此，当先开第一个锦囊来看。”于是开囊看了计策。便唤五百随行军士，一一分付如此如此，众军领命而去，又教玄德先往见乔国老，那乔国老乃二乔之父，居于南徐。玄德牵羊担酒，先往拜见，说吕范为媒、娶夫人之事。随行五百军士，俱披红挂彩，入南徐买办物件，传说玄德入赘东吴，城中人尽知其事。孙权知玄德已到，教吕范相待，且就馆舍安歇。\n\n
