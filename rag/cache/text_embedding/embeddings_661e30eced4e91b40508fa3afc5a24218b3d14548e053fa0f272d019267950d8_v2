It would be so familiar, so Supportive... and so deadly. Anteac was trying to lure him once more.\nShe spoke: “The machine cannot anticipate every problem of importance to humans. It is the difference between serial bits and an unbroken continuum. We have the one; machines are confined to the other.”\n“You still have the power of reason,” he said.\n“Share!” Luyseyal said. It was a command to Anteac and it revealed with sharp abruptness who really dominated this pair—the younger over the older.\nExquisite, Leto thought.\n“Intelligence adapts,” Anteac said.\nParsimonious with her words, too, Leto thought, hiding his amusement.\n“Intelligence creates,” Leto said. “That means you must deal with responses never before imagined. You must confront the new.”\n“Such as the possibility of the Ixian Machine,” Anteac said. It was not a question.\n“Isn't it interesting,” Leto asked, “that being a superb Reverend Mother is not enough?”\nHis acute senses detected the sudden fearful tightening in both of the women. Truthsayers, indeed!\n“You are right to fear me,” he said. Raising his voice, he demanded: “How do you know you’re even alive?”\nAs Moneo had done so many times, they heard in his voice the deadly consequences of failure to answer him correctly. It fascinated Leto that both women glanced at Moneo before either responded.\n“lam the mirror of myself,” Luyseyal said, a pat Bene Gesserit answer which Leto found offensive.\n“| don’t need pre-set tools to deal with my human problems,” Anteac said. “Your question is sophomoric!”\n“Hah, hah!” Leto laughed. “How would you like to quit the Bene Gesserit and join me?”\nHe could see her consider and then reject the invitation, but she did not hide her amusement.\nLeto looked at the puzzled Luyseyal. “If it falls outside your yardsticks, then you are engaged with intelligence, not with automation,” he said. And he thought: That Luyseyal will never again dominate old Anteac.\nLuyseyal was angry now and not bothering to conceal it. She said: “The Ixians are rumored to have provided you with machines that simulate human thinking. If you have such a low opinion of them, why...”\n“She should not be let out of the Chapter House without a guardian,” Leto said, addressing Anteac. “Is she afraid to address her own memories?”\nLuyseyal paled, but remained silent.\nLeto studied her coldly. “Our ancestors’ long unconscious relationship with machines has taught us something, don’t you think?”\nLuyseyal merely glared at him, not ready yet to risk death through open defiance of the God Emperor.\n“Would you say we at least know the attraction of machines?” Leto asked.\nLuyseyal nodded.\n“A well-maintained machine can be more reliable than a human servant,” Leto said. “We can trust machines not to indulge in emotional distractions.”\nLuyseyal found her voice. “Does this mean you intend to remove the Butlerian prohibition against abominable machines?”\n“| swear to you,” Leto said, speaking in his icy voice of disdain, “that if you display further such stupidity, | will have you publicly executed. | am not your Oracle!”\nLuyseyal opened her mouth and closed it without speaking.\nAnteac touched her companion’s arm, sending a quick tremor through Luyseyal’s body. Anteac spoke softly in an exquisite demonstration of Voice: “Our God Emperor will never openly defy the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad.”\nLeto smiled at her, a gentle commendation. It was such a pleasure to see a professional performing at her best.\n“That should be obvious to any conscious intelligence,” he said. “There are limits of my own choosing, places where | will not interfere.”\nHe could see both women absorbing the multi-pronged thrust of his words, weighing the possible meanings and intents. Was the God Emperor distracting them, focusing their attention on the Ixians while he maneuvered elsewhere? Was he telling the Bene Gesserit that the time had come to choose sides against the Ixians? Was it possible his words had no more than their surface motivations? Whatever his reasons, they could not be ignored. He was undoubtedly the most devious creature the universe had ever spawned.\nLeto scowled at Luyseyal, knowing he could only add to their confusion. “I point out to you, Marcus Claire Luyseyal, a lesson from past over-machined societies which you appear not to have learned. The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.”\nHe turned his attention to Moneo. “Moneo?”\n“I see him, Lord.”\nMoneo craned his neck to peer over the Bene Gesserit entourage. Duncan Idaho had entered the far portal, and strode across the open floor of the chamber toward Leto. Moneo did not relax his wariness, his distrust of the Bene Gesserit, but he recognized the nature of Leto’s lecture. He is testing, always testing.\nAnteac cleared her throat. “Lord, what of our reward?”\n“You are brave,” Leto said. “No doubt that’s why you were chosen for this Embassy. Very well, for the next decade | will continue your spice allotment at its present level. As for the rest, | will ignore what you really intended with the spice- essence. Am | not generous?”\n“Most generous, Lord,” Anteac said, and there was not the slightest hint of bitterness in her voice.\nDuncan Idaho brushed past the women then and stopped beside Moneo to peer up at Leto. “M’Lord, there’s .. .” He broke off and glanced at the two Reverend Mothers.\n“Speak openly,” Leto commanded.\n“Yes, m’Lord.” There was reluctance in him, but he obeyed. “We were attacked at the southeast edge of the City, a distraction | believe because there now are reports of more violence in the City and in the Forbidden Forest—many scattered raiding parties.”\n“They are hunting my wolves,” Leto said. “In the forest and in the City, they are hunting my wolves.”\nIdaho’s brows contracted into a puzzled frown. “Wolves in the City, m’Lord?”\n“Predators,” Leto said. “Wolves—to me there is no essential difference.”\nMoneo gasped.\nLeto smiled at him, thinking how beautiful it was to observe a moment of realization—a veil pulled away from the eyes, the mind opened.\n“| have brought a large force of guards to protect this place,” Idaho said. “They are posted through the...”\n“I knew you would,” Leto said. “Now pay close attention while I tell you where to send the rest of your forces.”\nAs the Reverend Mothers watched in awe, Leto laid out for Idaho the exact points for ambushes, detailing the size of each force and even some of the specific personnel, the timing, the necessary weapons, the precise deployments at each place. Idaho’s capacious memory catalogued each instruction. He was too caught up in the recital to question it until Leto fell silent, but a look of puzzled fear came over Idaho then.\nFor Leto, it was as though he peered directly into Idaho’s most essential awareness to read the thoughts there. / was a trusted soldier of the original Lord Leto, |\\daho was thinking. That Leto, the grandfather of this one, saved me and took me into his household like a son. But even though that Leto still has some kind of existence in this one... this is not him.\n“M’Lord, why do you need me?” Idaho asked.\n“For your strength and loyalty.”\nIdaho shook his head. “But...”\n“You obey,” Leto said, and he noted the way these words were being absorbed by the Reverend Mothers. Truth, only truth, for they are Truthsayers.\n“Because | owe a debt to the Atreides,” Idaho said.\n“That is where we place our trust,” Leto said. “And Duncan?”\n“M’Lord?” Idaho’s voice said he had found ground where he could stand.\n“Leave at least one survivor at each place,” Leto said. “Otherwise, our efforts are wasted.”\nIdaho nodded once, curtly, and left, striding back across the hall the way he had come. And Leto thought it would take an extremely sensitive eye indeed to see that it was a\ndifferent Idaho leaving, far different from the one who had entered.\nAnteac said: “This comes of flogging that Ambassador.”\n“Exactly,” Leto agreed. “Recount this carefully to your Superior, the admirable Reverend Mother Syaksa. Tell her for me that | prefer the company of predators above that of the prey.” He glanced at Moneo, who drew himself to attention. “Moneo, the wolves are gone from my forest. They must be replaced by human wolves. See to it.”\nThe trance-state of prophecy is like no other visionary experience. It is not a retreat from the raw exposure of the senses (as are many trance-states) but an immersion in a multitude of new movements. Things move. It is an ultimate pragmatism in the midst of Infinity, a demanding consciousness where you come at last into the unbroken awareness that the universe moves of itself, that it changes, that its rules change, that nothing remains permanent or absolute throughout all such movement, that mechanical explanations for anything can work only within precise confinements and, once the walls are broken down, the old explanations shatter and dissolve, blown away by new movements. The things you see in this trance are sobering, often shattering. They demand your utmost effort to remain whole and, even so, you emerge from that state profoundly changed.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nhat night of Audience Day, while others slept and fought\nand dreamed and died, Leto took his repose in the isolation of his audience chamber, only a few trusted Fish Speaker guards at the portals.\nHe did not sleep. His mind whirled with necessities and disappointments.\nHwi! Hwi!\nHe knew why Hwi Noree had been sent to him now. How well he knew!\nMy most secret secret is exposed.\nThey had discovered his secret. Hwi was the evidence of it.\nHe thought desperate thoughts. Could this terrible metamorphosis be reversed? Could he return to a human state?\nNot possible.\nEven if it were possible, the process would take him just as long as it had taken to reach this point. Where would Hwi\nbe in more than three thousand years? Dry dust and bones in the crypt.\n! could breed something like her and prepare that one for me... but that would not be my gentle Hwi.\nAnd what of the Golden Path while he indulged in such selfish goals?\nTo hell with the Golden Path! Have these folly-bound idiots ever thought once of me? Not once!\nBut that was not true. Hwi thought of him. She shared his torture.\nThese were thoughts of madness and he tried to put them away while his senses reported the soft movement of the guards and the flow of water beneath his chamber.\nWhen I made this choice, what were my expectations?\nHow the mob within laughed at that question! Did he not have a task to complete? Was that not the very essence of the agreement which kept the mob in check?\n“You have a task to complete,” they said. “You have but one purpose.”\nSingle purpose is the mark of the fanatic and! am not a fanatic!\n“You must be cynical and cruel. You cannot break the trust.”\nWhy not", ".\n! could breed something like her and prepare that one for me... but that would not be my gentle Hwi.\nAnd what of the Golden Path while he indulged in such selfish goals?\nTo hell with the Golden Path!

You chose this course.”\nExpectations!\n“The expectations which history creates for one generation are often shattered in the next generation. Who knows that better than you?”\nYes... and shattered expectations can alienate whole populations. | alone am a whole population!\n“Remember your oath!”\nIndeed. I am the disruptive force unleashed across the centuries. | limit expectations... including my own. | dampen the pendulum.\n“And then release it. Never forget that.”\nlam tired. Oh, how tired I am. If only | could sleep... really sleep.\n“You're full of self-pity, too.”\nWhy not? What am !? The ultimate loner forced to look at what might have been. Every day I look at it... and now. Hwi!\n“Your original unselfish choice fills you now with selfishness.”\nThere is danger all around. | must wear my selfishness like a suit of armor.\n“There’s danger for everyone who touches you. Isn't that your very nature?”\nDanger even for Hwi. Dear, delectable, dear Hwi.\n“Did you build high walls around you only to sit within them and indulge in self-pity?”\nThe walls were built because great forces have been unleashed in my Empire.\n“You unleashed them. Will you now compromise with them?”\nIt’s Hwi’s doing. These feelings have never before been this powerful in me. It’s the damnable Ixians!\n“How interesting that they should assault you with flesh rather than with a machine.”\nBecause they have discovered my secret.\n“You know the antidote.”\nLeto’s great body trembled through its entire length at this thought. He well knew the antidote which had always worked before: lose himself for a time in his own past. Not even the Bene Gesserit Sisters could take such safaris, striking inward along the axis of memories—back, back to the very limits of cellular awareness, or stopping by a wayside to revel in a sophisticated sensory delight. Once, after the death of a particularly superb Duncan, he had toured great musical performances preserved in his memories. Mozart had tired him quickly. Pretentious! But Bach... ahhh, Bach.\nLeto remembered the joy of it.\n| sat at the organ and let the music drench me.\nOnly three times in all memory had there been an equal to Bach. But even Licallo was not better, as good, but not better.\nWould female intellectuals be the proper choice for this night? Grandmother Jessica had been one of the best. Experience told him that someone as close to him as Jessica would not be the proper antidote for his present tensions. The search would have to venture much farther.\nHe imagined then describing such a safari to some awestruck visitor, a totally imaginary visitor because none would dare question him about such a holy matter.\n“I course backward down the flight of ancestors, hunting along the tributaries, darting into nooks and crannies. You would not recognize many of their names. Who has ever heard of Norma Cenva? | have lived her!”\n“Lived her?” his imaginary visitor asked.\n“Of course. Why else would one keep one’s ancestors around? You think a man designed the first Guild ship? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport? They lied. It was his mistress, Norma. She gave him the design, along with five children. He thought his ego would take no less. In the end, the knowledge that he had not really fulfilled his own image, that was what destroyed him.”\n“You have lived him, too?”\n“Naturally. And | have traversed the far wanderings of the Fremen. Through my father’s line and the others, | have gone right back to the House of Atreus.”\n“Such an illustrious line!”\n“With its fair share of fools.”\nDistraction is what | need, he thought.\nWould it be a tour through sexual dalliances and exploits, then?\n“You have no idea what internal orgies are available to me! | am the ultimate voyeur—participant(s) and\nobserver(s). Ignorance and misunderstandings about sexuality have caused so much distress. How abysmally narrow we have been—how miserly.”\nLeto knew he could not make that choice, not this night, not with Hwi out there in his City.\nWould he choose a review of warfare, then?\n“Which Napoleon was the greater coward?” he asked his imaginary visitor. “I will not reveal it, but | Know. Oh, yes, | know.”\nWhere can I go? With all of the past open to me, where can I go?\nThe brothels, the atrocities, the tyrants, the acrobats, nudists, surgeons, male whores, musicians, magicians, ungenciers, priests, artisans, priestesses...\n“Are you aware,” he asked his imaginary visitor, “that the hula preserves an ancient sign language which once belonged only to males? You’ve never heard of the hula? Of course. Who dances it anymore? Dancers have preserved many things, though. The translations have been lost, but | know them.\n“One whole night I was a series of caliphs moving eastward and westward with Islam—a traverse of centuries. | will not bore you with the details. Be gone now, visitor!”\nHow seductive it is, he thought, this call of the siren which would have me live only in the past.\nAnd how useless that past now, thanks to the damnable Ixians. How boring the past when Hwi is here. She would come to me right now if | summoned her. But I cannot call forher...notnow... not tonight.\nThe past continued to beckon.\n| could make a pilgrimage into my past. It does not have to be a safari. | could go alone. Pilgrimage purifies. Safaris make me into a tourist. That’s the difference. | could go alone into my inner world.\nAnd never return.\nLeto felt the inevitability of it, that the dream-state would eventually trap him.\n| create a special dream-state throughout my Empire. Within this dream, new myths form, new directions appear and new movements. New...new...new... The things emerge from my own dreams, out of my myths. Who more susceptible to them than I? The hunter is caught in his own net.\nLeto knew then that he had encountered a condition for which no antidote existed—past, present or future. His great body trembled and shivered in the gloom of his audience chamber.\nAt the portal, one Fish Speaker guard whispered to another: “Is God troubled?”\nAnd her companion replied: “The sins of this universe would trouble anyone.”\nLeto heard them and wept silently.\nWhen I set out to lead humankind along my Golden Path, | promised them a lesson their bones would remember. | Know a profound pattern which humans deny with their words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, the condition they call peace. Even as they speak, they create the seeds of turmoil and violence. If they find their quiet security, they squirm in it. How boring they find it. Look at them now. Look at what they do while I record these words. Hah! | give them enduring eons of enforced tranquility which plods on and on despite their every effort to escape into chaos. Believe me, the memory of Leto’s Peace shall abide with them forever. They will seek their quiet security thereafter only with extreme caution and steadfast preparation.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nM uch against his will, Idaho found himself at dawn with Siona beside him being taken to “a safe place” in an Imperial ornithopter. It raced eastward toward the golden arc of sunlight which lifted over a landscape carved into rectangular green plantations.\nThe ‘thopter was a big one, large enough to carry a small squad of Fish Speakers with their two guests. The pilot captain of the squad, a brawny woman with a face Idaho could believe had never smiled, had given her name as Inmeir. She sat in the pilot’s seat directly ahead of Idaho, two muscular Fish Speaker guards on either side of her. Five more guards sat behind Idaho and Siona.\n“God has ordered me to take you away from the City,” Inmeir had said, coming up to him in the command post beneath the central plaza. “It is for your own safety. We will return by tomorrow morning for Siaynoq.”\nIdaho, fatigued by a night of alarms, had sensed the futility of arguing against the orders of “God Himself.” Inmeir appeared quite capable of trundling him off under one of her thick arms. She had led him from the command\npost into a chilly night canopied with stars like stone-edged facets of shattered brilliants. It was only when they reached the ‘thopter and Idaho recognized Siona waiting there that\nhe had begun to question the purpose of this outing.\nDuring the night, Idaho had come to realize that not all of the violence in Onn had originated with the organized rebels. When he had inquired after Siona, Moneo had sent word that “my daughter is safely out of the way,” adding at the end of the message: “I commend her to your care.”\nIn the ‘thopter, Siona had not responded to Idaho’s questions. Even now, she sat in sullen silence beside him. She reminded him of himself in those first bitter days when he had vowed vengeance against the Harkonnens. He wondered at her bitterness. What drove her?\nWithout knowing why, Idaho found himself comparing Siona with Hwi Noree. It had not been easy to encounter Hwi, but he had managed it in spite of the importunate demands of Fish Speakers that he attend to duties elsewhere.\nGentle, that was the word for Hwi. She acted from a core of unchanging gentleness which was, in its own way, a thing of enormous power. He found this intensely attractive.\nI must see more of her.\nFor now, though, he had to contend with the sullen silence of Siona seated beside him. Well. . . silence could be met with silence.\nIdaho peered down at the passing landscape. Here and there he could see the clustered lights of villages winking out as the sunlight approached. The desert of the Sareer lay far behind and this was land that, by its appearance, might never have been parched.\nSome things do not change very much, he thought. They are merely taken from one place and reformed in another place.\nThis landscape reminded him of Caladan’s lush gardens and made him wonder what had become of the verdant\nplanet where the Atreides had lived for so many generations before coming to Dune. He could identify narrow roads, market roads with a scattered traffic of vehicles drawn by six-legged animals which he guessed were thorses. Moneo had said that thorses tailored", " found this intensely attractive.\nI must see more of her.\nFor now, though, he had to contend with the sullen silence of Siona seated beside him.

He could identify narrow roads, market roads with a scattered traffic of vehicles drawn by six-legged animals which he guessed were thorses. Moneo had said that thorses tailored to the needs of sucha landscape were the main work beasts not only here but throughout the Empire.\n“A population which walks is easier to control.”\nMoneo’s words rang in Idaho’s memory as he peered downward. Pastureland appeared ahead of the 'thopter, softly rolling green hills cut into irregular patterns by black stone walls. Idaho recognized sheep and several kinds of large cattle. The ‘thopter passed over a narrow valley still in gloom and with only a hint of the water coursing down its depths. A single light and a blue plume of smoke lifting out of the valley’s shadows spoke of human occupation.\nSiona suddenly stirred and tapped their pilot on the shoulder, pointing off to the right ahead of them.\n“Isn't that Goygoa over there?” Siona asked.\n“Yes.” Inmeir spoke without turning, her voice clipped and touched by some emotion which Idaho could not identify.\n“Is that not a safe place?” Siona asked.\n“It is safe.”\nSiona looked at Idaho. “Order her to take us to Goygoa.”\nWithout knowing why he complied, Idaho said: “Take us to that place.”\nInmeir turned then and her features, which Idaho had thought a square block of non-emotion during the night, revealed the clear evidence of some deep feeling. Her mouth was drawn down into a scowl. A nerve twitched at the corner of her right eye.\n“Not Goygoa, Commander,” Inmeir said. “There are better...”\n“Did the God Emperor tell you to take us to a specific place?” Siona demanded.\nInmeir glared her anger at this interruption, but did not look directly at Siona. “No, but He...”\n“Then take us to this Goygoa,” Idaho said.\nInmeir jerked her attention back to the ‘thopter’s controls and Idaho was thrown against Siona as the craft banked Sharply and flew toward a round pocket nestled in the green hills.\nIdaho peered over Inmeir’s shoulder to look at their destination. At the very center of the pocket lay a village built of the same black stones as the surrounding fences. Idaho saw orchards on some of the slopes above the village, terraced gardens rising in steps toward a small saddle where hawks could be seen gliding on the day’s first\nupdrafts. Looking at Siona, Idaho asked: “What is this Goygoa?” “You will see.”\nInmeir set the ’thopter into a shallow glide which brought them to a gentle landing on a flat stretch of grass at the edge of the village. One of the Fish Speakers opened the door on the village side. Idaho’s nostrils were immediately assaulted by a heady mixture of aromas—crushed grass, animal droppings, the acridity of cooking fires. He slipped out of the ’thopter and looked up a village street where people were emerging from their houses to stare at the visitors. Idaho saw an older woman in a long green dress bend over and whisper something to a child who immediately turned and went dashing away up the street.\n“Do you like this place?” Siona asked. She dropped down beside him.\n“It appears pleasant.”\nSiona looked at Inmeir as the pilot and the other Fish Speakers joined them on the grass. “When do we go back to Onn?”\n“You do not go back,” Inmeir said. “My orders are to take you to the Citadel. The Commander goes back.”\n“I see.” Siona nodded. “When will we leave?”\n“At dawn tomorrow. | will see the village leader about quarters.” Inmeir strode off into the village.\n“Goygoa,” Idaho said. “That’s a strange name. | wonder what this place was in the Dune days?”\n“I happen to know,” Siona said. “It is on the old charts as Shuloch, which means ‘haunted place.’ The Oral History Says great crimes were committed here before all of the inhabitants were wiped out.”\n“Jacurutu,” Idaho whispered, recalling the old legends of the water stealers. He glanced around, looking for the evidence of dunes and ridges; there was nothing—only two older men with placid faces returning with Inmeir. The men wore faded blue trousers and ragged shirts. Their feet were bare.\n“Did you know this place?” Siona asked.\n“Only as a name in a legend.”\n“Some say there are ghosts,” she said, “but | do not believe it.”\nInmeir stopped in front of Idaho and motioned the two barefooted men to wait behind her. “The quarters are poor but adequate,” she said, “unless you would care to stay in one of the private residences.” She turned and looked at Siona as she said this.\n“We will decide later,” Siona said. She took Idaho’s arm. “The Commander and | wish to stroll through Goygoa and admire the sights.”\nInmeir shaped her mouth to speak, but remained silent.\nIdaho allowed Siona to lead him past the peering faces of the two local men.\n“I will send two guards with you,” Inmeir called out.\nSiona stopped and turned. “Is it not safe in Goygoa?”\n“It is very peaceful here,” one of the men said.\n“Then we will not need guards,” Siona said. “Have them guard the ’thopter.”\nAgain, she led Idaho toward the village.\n“All right,” Idaho said, disengaging his arm from Siona’s grasp. “What is this place?”\n“It is very likely that you will find this a very restful place,” Siona said. “It is not like the old Shuloch at all. Very peaceful.”\n“You're up to something,” Idaho said, striding beside her. “What is it?”\n“I’ve always heard that gholas were full of questions,” Siona said. “I, too, have questions.”\n“Oh?”\n“What was he like in your day, the man Leto?”\n“Which one?”\n“Yes, | forget there were two—the grandfather and our Leto. | mean our Leto, of course.”\n“He was just a child, that’s all | know.”\n“The Oral History says one of his early brides came from this village.”\n“Brides? | thought...”\n“When he still had a manly shape. It was after the death of his sister but before he began to change into the Worm. The Oral History says the brides of Leto vanished into the maze of the Imperial Citadel, never to be seen again except as faces and voices transmitted by holo. He has not had a bride for thousands of years.”\nThey had arrived at a small square at the center of the village, a Space about fifty meters on a side and with a low- walled pool of clear water in its center. Siona crossed to the pool’s wall and sat on the rock ledge, patting beside her for Idaho to join her there. Idaho looked around at the village first, noting how people peered out at him from behind curtained windows, how the children pointed and whispered. He turned and stood looking down at Siona.\n“What is this place?”\n“I’ve told you. Tell me what Muad’Dib was like.”\n“He was the best friend a man could ever have.”\n“So the Oral History is true, but it calls the caliphate of his heirs The Desposyni, and that has an evil sound.”\nShe’s baiting me, Idaho thought.\nHe allowed himself a tight smile, wondering at Siona’s motives. She appeared to be waiting for some important event, anxious ... even dreading .. . but with an undertone of something like elation. It was all there. Nothing she said now could be accounted as more than small talk, a way of occupying the moments until... until what?\nThe light sound of running feet intruded on his reverie. Idaho turned and saw a child of perhaps eight years racing toward him out of a side street. The child’s bare feet kicked up little dust geysers as he ran and there was the sound of a woman shouting, a despairing sound somewhere up the street. The runner stopped about ten paces away and stared up at Idaho with a hungering look, an intensity which Idaho found disturbing. The child appeared vaguely familiar—a boy, a stalwart figure with dark curly hair, an unfinished face but with hints of the man to be—rather high cheekbones, a flat line across the brows. He wore a faded blue singlesuit which betrayed the effects of much laundering but obviously had begun as a garment of excellent material. It had the look of punji cotton woven ina cordlock that did not permit even the frayed edges to unravel.\n“You're not my father,” the child said. Whirling away, he raced back up the street and vanished around a corner.\nIdaho turned and scowled at Siona, almost afraid to ask the question: Was that a child of my predecessor? He knew the answer without asking—that familiar face, the genotype carried true. Myself as a child. Realization left him with an empty feeling, a sense of frustration. What is my responsibility?\nSiona put both hands over her face and hunched her shoulders. It had not happened at all the way she had imagined it might. She felt betrayed by her own desires for\nrevenge. Idaho was not simply a ghola, something alien and unworthy of consideration. She had felt him thrown against her in the ‘thopter, had seen the obvious emotions on his face. And that child...\n“What happened to my predecessor?” Idaho asked. His voice came out flat and accusatory.\nShe lowered her hands. There was suppressed rage in his face.\n“We are not certain,” she said, “but he entered the Citadel one day and never emerged.”\n“That was his child?”\nShe nodded.\n“You're sure you did not kill my predecessor?”\n“I...” She shook her head, shocked by the doubts, the latent accusation in him.\n“That child, that is the reason we came here?”\nShe swallowed. “Yes.”\n“What am | supposed to do about him?”\nShe shrugged, feeling soiled and guilty because of her own actions.\n“What about his mother?” Idaho asked.\n“She and the others live up that street.” Siona nodded in the direction the boy had gone.\n“Others?”\n“There is an older son ...a daughter. Will you... 1 mean, | could arrange...”\n“No! The boy was right. I’m not his father.”\n“I’m sorry,” Siona whispered. “I should not have done this.”\n“Why did he choose this place?” Idaho asked.\n“The father... your...”\n“My predecessor!”\n“Because this was Irti’s home and she would not leave. That is what people said.”\n“Irti... the mother?”\n“Wife, by the old rite, the one from the Oral History.”\nIdaho looked around at the stone fronts of the buildings which"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_661e30eced4e91b40508fa3afc5a24218b3d14548e053fa0f272d019267950d8_v2"}
