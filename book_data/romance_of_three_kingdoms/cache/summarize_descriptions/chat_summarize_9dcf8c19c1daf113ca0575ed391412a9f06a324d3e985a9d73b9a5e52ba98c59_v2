He is a member of the Cao family and is known for his rebellious actions against the influential general Sima Yi. Throughout his military career, 夏侯霸 demonstrated a complex relationship with the Shu Han state, particularly through his interactions with the general 姜维.\n\nDuring a significant military engagement, 夏侯霸 successfully captured soldiers from the Shu Han, showcasing his tactical prowess. He fought alongside 姜维 in various battles, indicating a collaborative effort in the defense against Wei's attacks. Despite his initial successes, 夏侯霸 faced challenges, including a notable defeat when he led troops towards the city of 洮阳, where he fell into a strategic trap.\n\nIn a twist of fate, 夏侯霸's fortunes changed when he ultimately surrendered. Following his surrender, he was escorted by 姜维 to meet the emperor, marking a significant turn in his military career. This act of surrender highlights the complexities of loyalty and allegiance during this period, as he transitioned from a general of Wei to a figure under the authority of Shu Han.\n\nOverall, 夏侯霸's legacy is marked by his military leadership, his familial ties to the Cao family, and his interactions with key figures such as 姜维.
