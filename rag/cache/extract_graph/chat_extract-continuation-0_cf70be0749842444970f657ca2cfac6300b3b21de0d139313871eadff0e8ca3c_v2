Odrade, this daughter out of his past, was a full Reverend Mother with extraordinary powers of muscle and nerve control—full\nmemories on the female side! She was one of the special ones! She knew tricks of violence that few humans ever suspected. Still, that similarity, that essence remained and a Mentat always saw it.\nWhat does she want?\nAffirmation of his paternity? She already had all of the confirmation she could need.\nObserving her now, the way she waited so patiently for his thoughts to resolve, Teg reflected that it often was said with truth that Reverend Mothers no longer were completely members of the human race. They moved somehow outside the main flow, perhaps parallel to it, perhaps diving into it occasionally for their own purposes, but always removed from humankind. They removed themselves. It was an identifying mark of the Reverend Mother, a sense of extra identity that made them closer to the long-dead Tyrant than to the human stock from which they sprang.\nManipulation. That was their mark. They manipulated everyone and everything.\n“lam to be the Bene Gesserit eyes,” Teg said. “Taraza wants me to make a human decision for all of you.”\nObviously pleased, Odrade squeezed his arm. “What a father | have!”\n“Do you really have a father?” he asked and he recounted for her what he had been thinking about the Bene Gesserit removing themselves from humanity.\n“Outside humanity,” she said. “What a curious idea. Are Guild navigators also outside their original humanity?”\nHe thought about this. Guild navigators diverged widely from humankind’s more common shape. Born in space and living out their lives in tanks of melange gas, they distorted the original form, elongated and repositioned limbs and organs. But a young navigator in estrus and before entering the tank could breed with a norm. It had been demonstrated. They became non-human but not in the way of the Bene Gesserit.\n“Navigators are not your mental kin,” he said. “They think human. Guiding a ship through space, even with prescience to find the safe way, has a pattern a human can accept.”\n“You don’t accept our pattern?”\n“As far as | can, but somewhere in your development you shift outside the original pattern. | think you may perform a conscious act even to appear human. This way you hold my arm right now, as though you really were my daughter.”\n“I am your daughter but I’m surprised you think so little of us.”\n“Quite the contrary: | stand in awe of you.”\n“Of your own daughter?”\n“Of any Reverend Mother.”\n“You think | exist only to manipulate lesser creatures?”\n“I think you no longer really feel human. There’s a gap in you, something missing, something you’ve removed. You no longer are one of us.”\n“Thank you,” Odrade said. “Taraza told me you would not hesitate to answer truthfully, but | knew that for myself.”\n“For what have you prepared me?”\n“You will know it when it occurs; that is all I cansay... all | am permitted to say.”\nManipulating again! he thought. Damn them!\nOdrade cleared her throat. She appeared about to say something more but she remained silent as she guided Teg around and strolled with him back across the chamber.\nEven though she had known what Teg must say, his words pained her. She wanted to tell him that she was one of those who still felt human, but his judgment of the Sisterhood could not be denied.\nWe are taught to reject love. We can simulate it but each of us is capable of cutting it off in an instant.\nThere were sounds behind them. They stopped and turned. Lucilla and Taraza emerged from a lift tube speaking idly about their observations of the ghola.\n“You are absolutely right to treat him as one of us,” Taraza said.\nTeg heard but made no comment as they awaited the approach of the two women.\nHe knows, Odrade thought. He will not ask me about my birth-mother. There was no bonding, no real imprint. Yes, he knows.\nOdrade closed her eyes and memory startled her by producing of itself an image of a painting. The thing occupied a space on the wall of Taraza’s morning room. Ixian artifice had preserved the painting in the finest hermetically sealed frame behind a cover of invisible plaz. Odrade often stopped in front of the painting, feeling each time that her hand might reach out and actually touch the ancient Canvas so cunningly preserved by the Ixians.\nCottages at Cordeville.\nThe artist’s name for his work and his own name were preserved on a burnished plate beneath the painting: Vincent Van Gogh.\nThe thing dated from a time so ancient that only rare remnants such as this painting remained to send a physical impression down the ages. She had tried to imagine the journeys that painting had taken, the serial chance that had brought it intact to Taraza’s room.\nThe Ixians had been at their best in the preservation and restoration. An observer could touch a dark spot on the lower left corner of the frame. Immediately, you were engulfed in the true genius, not only of the artist, but of the Ixian who had restored and preserved the work. His name was there on the frame: Martin Buro. When touched by the human finger, the dot became a sense projector, a benign spin-off of the technology that had produced the Ixian Probe. Buro had restored not only the painting but the painter—Van Gogh's feeling—accompaniment to each brush stroke. All had been captured in the brush strokes, recorded there by human movements.\nOdrade had stood there engrossed through the whole performance so many times she felt she could re-create the painting independently.\nRecalling this experience so near to Teg’s accusation, she knew at once why her memory had reproduced the image for her, why that painting still fascinated her. For the brief space of that replay she always felt totally human, aware of the cottages as places where real people dwelled, aware in some complete way of the living chain that had paused there in the person of the mad Vincent Van Gogh, paused to record itself.\nTaraza and Lucilla stopped about two paces from Teg and Odrade. There was a smell of garlic on Taraza’s breath.\n“We stopped for a small bite to eat,” Taraza said. “Would you like anything?”\nIt was exactly the wrong question. Odrade freed her hand from Teg’s arm. She turned quickly and wiped her eyes on her cuff. Looking up once more at Teg, she saw surprise on his face. Yes, she thought, those were real tears!\n“I think we’ve done everything here that we can,” Taraza said.\n“It’s time you were on your way to Rakis, Dar.”\n“Past time,” Odrade said.\nLife cannot find reasons to sustain it, cannot be a source of decent mutual regard, unless each of us resolves to breathe such qualities into it.\n—CHENOEH: “CONVERSATIONS WITH LETO II”\nH edley Tuek, High Priest of the Divided God, had grown increasingly angry with Stiros. Although too old himself ever to hope for the High Priest’s bench, Stiros had sons, grandsons, and numerous nephews. Stiros had transferred his personal ambitions to his family. A cynical man, Stiros. He represented a powerful faction in the priesthood, the so- called scientific community, whose influence was insidious and pervasive. They veered dangerously close to heresy.\nTuek reminded himself that more than one High Priest had been /ost in the desert, regrettable accidents. Stiros and his faction were capable of creating such an accident.\nIt was afternoon in Keen and Stiros had just departed, obviously frustrated. Stiros wanted Tuek to go into the desert and personally observe Sheeana’s next venture there. Suspicious of the invitation, Tuek declined.\nA strange argument ensued, full of innuendo and vague references to Sheeana’s behavior plus wordy attacks on the Bene Gesserit. Stiros, always suspicious of the Sisterhood, had taken an immediate dislike to the new commander of the Bene Gesserit Keep on Rakis, this .. . what was her name? Oh, yes, Odrade. Odd name but then the Sisters often took odd names. That was their privilege. God Himself had never spoken against the basic goodness of the Bene Gesserit. Against individual Sisters, yes, but the Sisterhood itself had shared God’s Holy Vision.\nTuek did not like the way Stiros spoke of Sheeana. Cynical. Tuek had finally silenced Stiros with pronouncements delivered here in the Sanctus with its high altar and images of the Divided God. Prismatic beam-relays cast thin wedges of brilliance through drifting incense from burning melange onto the double line of tall pillars that led up to the altar. Tuek knew his words went directly to God from this setting.\n“God works through our latter-day Siona,” Tuek had told Stiros, noting the confusion on the old councillor’s face. “Sheeana is the living reminder of Siona, that human instrument who translated Him into His present Divisions.”\nStiros raged, saying things he would not dare repeat before the full Council. He presumed too much on his long association with Tuek.\n“I tell you she is sitting here surrounded by adults intent upon justifying themselves to her and—”\n“And to God!” Tuek could not let such words pass.\nLeaning close to the High Priest, Stiros grated: “She is at the center of an educational system geared to anything her imagination demands. We deny her nothing!”\n“Nor should we.”\nIt was as though Tuek had not spoken. Stiros said, “Cania has provided her with recordings from Dar-es-Balat!”\n“I am the Book of Fate,” Tuek intoned, quoting God’s own words from the hoard at Dar-es-Balat.\n“Exactly! And she listens to every word!”\n“Why does this disturb you?” Tuek asked in his calmest tone.\n“We don’t test her knowledge. She tests ours!”\n“God must want it so.”\nNo mistaking the bitter anger on Stiros’ face. Tuek observed this and waited while the old councillor marshaled new arguments. Resources for such arguments were, of course, enormous. Tuek did not deny this. It was the interpretations that mattered. Which was why a High Priest\nmust be the final interpreter. Despite (or perhaps because of) their way of viewing history, the priesthood knew a great deal of how God had come to reside on Rakis. They had Dar- es-Balat itself and all of its contents—the earliest known no- chamber in the universe. For millennia, while Shai-hulud translated the verdant planet of Arrakis into desert-Rakis, Dar-es-Balat waited under the sands. From that Holy Hoard, the priesthood possessed God’s own voice, His printed words and even holophotos. Everything was explained and they knew that the desert surface of Rakis reproduced the original form of the planet, the way it looked in the beginning when it was the only known source of the Holy Spice.\n“She asks about God’s family,” Stiros said. “Why should she have to ask about—”\n“She tests us. Do we give Them Their proper places? The Reverend Mother Jessica to her son, Muad’Dib, to his son, Leto II—the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven.”\n“Leto Ill,” Stiros muttered. “What of the other Leto who died at Sardaukar hands? What of him?”\n“Careful, Stiros,” Tuek intoned. “You know my great- grandfather pronounced upon that question from this very bench.
