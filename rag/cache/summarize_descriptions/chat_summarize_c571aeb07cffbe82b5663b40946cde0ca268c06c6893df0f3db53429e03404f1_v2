This technique allows individuals to tap into the knowledge, experiences, and insights of their female ancestors, influencing decisions and deepening understanding. The memories are often passed down through generations, creating a vast repository of wisdom. However, accessing these memories can sometimes lead to traumatic revelations, as they may contain unresolved emotions or harrowing experiences from the past.  \n\nThe ability is a closely guarded secret of the Bene Gesserit, and its use is typically restricted to trained Reverend Mothers. Instances of unauthorized access, such as by Dortujla, highlight the order's strict control over this power. References in Odrade's thoughts further emphasize its significance within the sisterhood, shaping their strategies and philosophies.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some framing it as a \"collective memory access technique\" and others as an \"ancestral memory ability\"—they all converge on its core function: a psychic link to the past that grants the Bene Gesserit unparalleled insight. The term \"Other Memory\" thus encapsulates both the mystical and practical dimensions of this ability, serving as a cornerstone of Bene Gesserit tradition and power.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251864, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 501, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 188}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
