A curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads.\n“Seal your suit,” Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his face.\nGurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.\nPaul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: “Which of your crew don’t you trust, Gurney?”\n“There’re some new recruits,” Gurney said. “Offworlders....” He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so easily to his tongue.\n“Yes?” Paul said.\n“They're not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get,” Gurney said. “They’re tougher.”\n“Harkonnen spies?” Paul asked.\n“I think, m’Lord, that they report to no Harkonnen. | suspect they’re men of the Imperial service. They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about them.”\nPaul shot a sharp glance at him. “Sardaukar?”\nGurney shrugged. “They could be, but it’s well masked.”\nPaul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern of Atreides retainer...but with subtle reservations...differences. Arrakis had changed him, too.\nTwo hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing upward. One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder.\n“Where are my crew now?” Gurney asked.\n“Secure in the rocks below us,” Paul said. “We’ve a cave here—Cave of Birds. We'll decide what to do with them after the storm.”\nA voice called from above them: “Muad’Dib!”\nPaul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave. Paul signaled he had heard.\nGurney studied him with a new expression. “You're Muad’Dib?” he asked. “You're the will-o’-the-sand?”\n“It's my Fremen name,” Paul said.\nGurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding. Half his own crew dead on the sand, the others captive. He did not care about the new recruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men, friends, people for whom he felt responsible. “We’ll decide what to do with them after the storm.” That’s what Paul had said, Muad’Dib had\nsaid. And Gurney recalled the stories told of Muad’Dib, the Lisan al-Gaib—how he had taken the Skin of a Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded by death commandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their lips.\nHim.\nThe two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of Paul. The dark-faced one said: “All secure, Muad’Dib. We best get below now.”\n“Right.”\nGurney noted the tone of the man’s voice—half command and half request. This was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new Fremen legends.\nPaul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: “Korba, what’s in the bundle?”\nStilgar answered: “’Twas in the crawler. It had the initial of your friend here and it contains a baliset. Many times have | heard you speak of the prowess of Gurney Halleck on the baliset.”\nGurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.\n“You’ve a companion who thinks, m’Lord,” Gurney said. “Thank you, Stilgar.”\nStilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said: “Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here.”\nGurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this conversation. There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney wondered if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen. Here\nwas someone called Gurney Halleck who’d known Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who Shared a cameraderie that Stilgar could never invade.\n“You are two I'd have be friends,” Paul said.\n“Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown,” Gurney said. “Any killer of Harkonnens I'd feel honored to count among my friends.”\n“Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?” Paul asked.\nSlowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy calluses of Gurney’s swordhand. “There’re few who haven’t heard the name of Gurney Halleck,” he said, and released his grip. He turned to Paul. “The storm comes rushing.”\n“At once,” Paul said.\nStilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and turning path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave. Men hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them. Glowglobes showed a broad, dome-ceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from it.\nPaul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into the passage. The others headed for another passage opposite the entrance. Paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-colored hangings on its walls.\n“We can have some privacy here for a while,” Paul said. “The others will respect my—”\nAn alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting and clashing of weapons. Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and out\nonto the atrium lip above the outer chamber. Gurney was right behind, weapon drawn.\nBeneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures. Paul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the Fremen robes and bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed. Senses that his mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant face—the Fremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes, but the smugglers were crouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed.\nThat habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.\nA Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battle cry was lifted to echo in the chamber: “Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!”\nAnother eye had also picked Paul out. A black knife came hurtling toward him. Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him, glanced to see Gurney retrieve it.\nThe triangular knots were being pressed back now.\nGurney held the knife up in front of Paul’s eyes, pointed to the hairline yellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest, multifaceted eyes at the pommel.\nSardaukar for certain.\nPaul stepped out to the lip of the ledge. Only three of the Sardaukar remained. Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted pattern across the chamber.\n“Hold!” Paul shouted. “The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!”\nThe fighting wavered, hesitated.\n“You Sardaukar!” Paul called to the remaining group. “By whose orders do you threaten a ruling Duke?” And, quickly, as his men started to press in around the Sardaukar: “Hold, | say!”\nOne of the cornered trio straightened. “Who says we're Sardaukar?” he demanded.\nPaul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. “This Says you’re Sardaukar.”\n“Then who says you’re a ruling Duke?” the man demanded.\nPaul gestured to the Fedaykin. “These men say I’m a ruling Duke. Your own emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. /am House Atreides.”\nThe Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.\nPaul studied the man—tall, flat-featured, with a pale scar across half his left cheek. Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there was that pride about him without which a Sardaukar appeared undressed—and with which he could appear fully clothed though naked.\nPaul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: “Korba, how came they to have weapons?”\n“They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their stillsuits,” the lieutenant said.\nPaul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his attention back to the lieutenant. There was no need for words. The lieutenant lowered his eyes.\n“Where is Chani?” Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.\n“Stilgar spirited her aside.” He nodded toward the other passage, glanced at the dead and wounded. “I hold myself responsible for this mistake, Muad’Dib.”\n“How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?” Paul asked.\n“Ten.”\nPaul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.\nA tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus exposed to danger. This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the Fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of Muad’Dib.\nWithout turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: “How many are our casualties?”\n“Four wounded, two dead, Muad’Dib.”\nPaul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar; Chani and Stilgar were standing in the other passage. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring into the offworld whites of the spokesman’s eyes. “You, what is your name?” Paul demanded.\nThe man stiffened, glanced left and right.\n“Don’t try it,” Paul said. “It’s obvious to me that you were ordered to seek out and destroy Muad’Dib. l'Il warrant you were the ones suggested seeking Spice in the deep desert.”\nA gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin Smile to Paul’s lips. Blood suffused the Sardaukar’s face.\n“What you see before you is more than Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “Seven of you are dead for two of us. Three for one. Pretty good against Sardaukar, eh?”\nThe man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.\n“I asked your name,” Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice: “Tell me your name!”\n“Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!” the man snapped. His jaw dropped. He stared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.\n“Well, Captain Aramsham,” Paul said, “the Harkonnens would pay dearly to learn what you now know. And the Emperor—what he wouldn’t give to learn an Atreides still lives despite his treachery.”\nThe captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him. Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the man’s head. Sardaukar did not Submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.\nStill using the Voice, Paul said: “Submit, Captain.”\nThe man at the captain’s left leaped without warning\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GURNEY<|>PERSON<|>Gurney is a loyal retainer of House Atreides and a skilled warrior and musician, known for his prowess on the baliset.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, is the Duke of House Atreides and a central figure in Fremen society, revered as a leader and prophet.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a prominent Fremen leader and a close ally of Paul Atreides, known for his combat skills and loyalty.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KORBA<|>PERSON<|>Korba is a Fremen lieutenant and a follower of Muad'Dib, involved in security and combat operations.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANI<|>PERSON<|>Chani is Paul Atreides' concubine and the mother of his firstborn, a significant figure in Fremen culture.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPTAIN ARAMSHAM<|>PERSON<|>Captain Aramsham is an Imperial Sardaukar officer, tasked with eliminating Muad'Dib and his followers.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Atreides is a noble family in the Imperium, currently led by Paul Atreides, with strong ties to the Fremen.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are the native people of Arrakis, known for their fierce independence and mastery of desert survival.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARDAUKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are the elite military force of the Padishah Emperor, feared for their combat prowess.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet, the only source of the spice melange, and the home of the Fremen.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAVE OF BIRDS<|>GEO<|>The Cave of Birds is a Fremen hideout used for shelter during sandstorms.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a detention facility in Tiruzia, mentioned in the context of hostage exchanges.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTLE IN THE CAVE<|>EVENT<|>A violent confrontation between Fremen and Sardaukar forces in the Cave of Birds, resulting in casualties.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>GURNEY<|>Paul and Gurney share a long-standing camaraderie and mutual respect, dating back to their time before Arrakis.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>STILGAR<|>Paul and Stilgar have a close alliance, with Stilgar serving as a key Fremen leader under Paul's command.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>CHANI<|>Paul and Chani are partners, with Chani being the mother of Paul's firstborn and a central figure in his life.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GURNEY<|>STILGAR<|>Gurney and Stilgar are introduced as potential friends, with Gurney expressing admiration for Stilgar's reputation.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>Paul is the Duke and leader of House Atreides, representing its interests and legacy.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>FREMEN<|>Paul is revered as Muad'Dib by the Fremen, who follow him as their leader and prophet.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>SARDAUKAR<|>The Fremen and Sardaukar are adversaries, with the Fremen defending against Sardaukar attacks.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>SARDAUKAR<|>Paul is a target of the Sardaukar, who seek to eliminate him under Imperial orders.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GURNEY<|>HOUSE ATREIDES<|>Gurney is a loyal retainer of House Atreides, serving its interests and members.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>FREMEN<|>Stilgar is a prominent leader of the Fremen, deeply involved in their culture and struggles.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHANI<|>FREMEN<|>Chani is a respected member of Fremen society, closely tied to their traditions and leadership.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAPTAIN ARAMSHAM<|>SARDAUKAR<|>Captain Aramsham is a commanding officer of the Sardaukar, leading their operations on Arrakis.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>BATTLE IN THE CAVE<|>Paul is a central figure in the battle, commanding his forces against the Sardaukar.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GURNEY<|>BATTLE IN THE CAVE<|>Gurney participates in the battle, supporting Paul and the Fremen against the Sardaukar.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>BATTLE IN THE CAVE<|>Stilgar is involved in the battle, leading Fremen forces against the Sardaukar.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
