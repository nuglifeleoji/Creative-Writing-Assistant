司马徽再荐名士 刘玄德三顾草庐\n\n    \t\t\n\n    却说徐庶趱程赴许昌。曹操知徐庶已到，遂命荀彧、程昱等一班谋士往迎之。庶入相府拜见曹操。操曰：“公乃高明之士，何故屈身而事刘备乎？”庶曰：“某幼逃难，流落江湖，偶至新野，遂与玄德交厚，老母在此，幸蒙慈念，不胜愧感。”操曰：“公今至此，正可晨昏侍奉令堂，吾亦得听清诲矣。”庶拜谢而出。急往见其母，泣拜于堂下。母大惊曰：“汝何故至此？”庶曰：“近于新野事刘豫州；因得母书，故星夜至此。”徐母勃然大怒，拍案骂曰：“辱子飘荡江湖数年，吾以为汝学业有进，何其反不如初也！汝既读书，须知忠孝不能两全。岂不识曹操欺君罔上之贼？刘玄德仁义布于四海，况又汉室之胄，汝既事之，得其主矣，今凭一纸伪书，更不详察，遂弃明投暗，自取恶名，真愚夫也！吾有何面目与汝相见！汝玷辱祖宗，空生于天地间耳！”骂得徐庶拜伏于地，不敢仰视，母自转入屏风后去了。少顷，家人出报曰：“老夫人自缢于梁间。”徐庶慌入救时，母气已绝。后人有《徐母赞》曰：“贤哉徐母，流芳千古：守节无亏，于家有补；教子多方，处身自苦；气若丘山，义出肺腑；赞美豫州，毁触魏武；不畏鼎镬，不惧刀斧；唯恐后嗣，玷辱先祖。伏剑同流，断机堪伍；生得其名，死得其所：贤哉徐母，流芳千古！”徐虑见母已死，哭绝于地，良久方苏。曹操使人赍礼吊问，又亲往祭奠。徐庶葬母柩于许昌之南原，居丧守墓。凡曹操所赐，庶俱不受。\n\n
