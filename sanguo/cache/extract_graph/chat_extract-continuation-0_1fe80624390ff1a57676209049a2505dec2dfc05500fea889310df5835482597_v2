   却说曹睿之后毛氏，乃河内人也；先年睿为平原王时，最相恩爱；及即帝位，立为后；后睿因宠郭夫人，毛后失宠。郭夫人美而慧，睿甚嬖之，每日取乐，月余不出宫闼。是岁春三月，芳林园中百花争放，睿同郭夫人到园中赏玩饮酒。郭夫人曰：“何不请皇后同乐？”壑曰；“若彼在，腾涓滴不能下咽也。”遂传谕宫娥，不许令毛后知道。毛后见睿月余不入正宫，是日引十余宫人，来翠花楼上消遣，只听的乐声嘹亮，乃问曰：“何处奏乐？”一宫官启曰：“乃圣上与郭夫人于御花园中赏花饮酒。”毛后闻之，心中烦恼，回宫安歇。次日，毛皇后乘小车出宫游玩，正迎见睿于曲廊之间，乃笑曰：“陛下昨游北园，其乐不浅也！”睿大怒，即命擒昨日侍奉诸人到，叱曰：“昨游北园，朕禁左右不许使毛后知道，何得又宣露！”喝令宫官将诸侍奉人尽斩之。毛后大惊，回车至宫，睿即降诏赐毛皇后死，立郭夫人为皇后。朝臣莫敢谏者。\n\n    忽一日，幽州刺史毋丘俭上表，报称辽东公孙渊造反，自号为燕王，改元绍汉元年，建宫殿，立官职，兴兵入寇，摇动北方。睿大惊，即聚文武官僚，商议起兵退渊之策。正是：才将土木劳中国，又见干戈起外方。未知何以御之，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第一百六回　公孙渊兵败死襄平　司马懿诈病赚曹�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
