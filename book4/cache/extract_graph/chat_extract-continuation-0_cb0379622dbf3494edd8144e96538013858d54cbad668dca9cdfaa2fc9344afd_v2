许是为了把工作做好，可是有些做法太不象话了……“……再比如，高家湾高廷亮，只是耕自留地时多占了队里的两铧，纠正过来，在生产队做个检查就行了，也拉来劳教……” \n　　“两铧地实际上是个路线问题！毛主席说，严重的问题是教育农民！”徐治功扭过头反驳白明川。 \n　　“毛主席是说过这话。但毛主席没说让咱们动不动就‘劳教’农民嘛！” \n　　“这不是我的发明！这是县上冯世宽主任的政策。你觉得冯主任不对，你到上面另讨个指示来，我徐治功照办！”“唉……”白明川也没什么好说的了。过了一会，才有点痛苦地说：“治功，还是稳当一点好。你记得不？咱们在高家湾下乡时，饭派在廷亮家，他们当时都快断炊了，为了招待咱两个，跑出去问邻居借了半升白面……你怎好意思就因为这么点事把人家拉到工地上劳教……” \n　　徐治功为白明川的没水平话都想笑了，说：“难道共产党员因为吃了一顿饭，就连革命原则也不要了吗？”“抽烟！”田福堂又掏出两根纸烟，对两位争吵的上级说：“接上抽！” \n　　这时候，听见外面有人敲门。 \n　　站在门后面的白明川顺手把门拉开，接着便叫道：“噢，是润叶嘛！你什么时候回来的？你爸也正在这里呢！”田福堂一看是自家的女儿，赶紧走过来，问他：“坐顺车回来的？” \n　　润叶说：“是公共汽车。” \n　　徐治功一看是福堂的女儿，满脸的不高兴暂时收藏起来，笑着说：“你怎知道你爸在公社哩？” \n　　“我不是找我爸，我来找你和白叔叔。”润叶说。“什么事？”白明川和徐治功几乎同时问。 \n　　田福堂也不知他女儿找公社领导有什么事，站在旁边一脸的迷惑。 \n　　润叶接着就把她二爸的信递给了白明川。 \n　　白明川拆开信，看见上面写着——明川、治功二同志： \n　　你们好。 \n　　据反映，你社罐子村社员王满银因贩了几包老鼠药，现被押到双水村公社农田基建工地“劳教”。如此人再无其它问题，我意可严肃教育一下，让其回队去。 \n　　对于类似其他人员的问题，也望你们能慎重处理，严格执行党的一贯政策，切不可随意行事。这是我个人的意见，请你们二位酌处。 \n　　此致 \n　　敬礼！ \n　　田福军 \n　　白明川看完信后，就交给了徐治功。徐治功也很快把信看完了。两个人一时间都不言传，各抽各的纸烟。另一边，田福堂还不知内情，偷偷问女儿：“什么事？”润叶对父亲说：“我二爸写信，让把兰花的女婿放了。” \n　　“你二爸怎知道这事哩？”�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
