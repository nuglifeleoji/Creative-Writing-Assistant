“过来。”叶灵瞳向他招招手。\n\n    “怎么了？”蓝轩宇来到她面前。\n\n    叶灵瞳道：“让我捏一下你的脸。”她不服气。女孩子总是比男孩子成熟的早一些，她准备找个借口，不打一架是出不了气的。十级又怎么样，自己可是从小就学习古武术的。一定打得过他。\n\n    可是，让她万万想不到的是蓝轩宇的回答。\n\n    “那你轻一点。”蓝轩宇似乎很是习以为常的说道。\n\n    他那微微有些婴儿肥、白里透红的小脸不知道被多少人摸过、捏过了。长得可爱有的时候也不是那么美妙。所以，他也习惯了。\n\n    叶灵瞳却有些发愣，这家伙……\n\n    但她还是抬起手，用力的在蓝轩宇的脸上捏了一把。\n\n    嫩嫩的，滑滑的，似乎比自己的皮肤还好，而且比自己的面颊肉一些。捏起来还挺舒服的。\n\n    不知道为什么，捏了这一下之后，叶灵瞳心里的气突然没了。\n\n    “好疼啊！”蓝轩宇后退一步，有些委屈的看着她，“你不好。”\n\n    叶灵瞳倔强的道：“那又怎么样？”\n\n    蓝轩宇揉着自己的面庞，认真的道：“我不喜欢不好的人。所以，我不喜欢你。”\n\n    叶灵瞳不屑的道：“谁用你喜欢了？”说完，她转身就走。\n\n    蓝轩宇心中有些莫名其妙的感觉，他并不知道自己在什么地方得罪了她。\n\n    新生足有一百多人，将会分成六个班，每个班都是二十到三十名学生不等。各有正副班主任一名，正班主任负责教学，副班主任负责生活。\n\n    分班考试比想象中简单，其实就是释放一下自己的武魂，就结束了。\n\n    毕竟是初级魂师学院的入学考试，根本不可能有对抗之类的考核。学院更多的是通过了解学生的武魂，根据不同武魂的不同修炼方向而进行分班。\n\n    “一年级一班，主强攻系。下面我念到名字的同学到这边来。叶灵瞳……”\n\n    ……\n\n    “一年级二班，主控制系。下面我念到名字的同学过来，……，蓝轩宇，……”\n\n    初级魂师学院的教学，还不存在魂师彼此配合。更多的是了解武魂、了解修炼方式，提升自己，走好自己的方向。\n\n    拥有“蓝银草”武魂的蓝轩宇，很自然的被分在了学习控制系魂师修炼方向的一年级二班。\n\n    一年级二班，一共二十六个孩子。都是控制系学员。蓝轩宇在分班之后，就再没看到叶灵瞳了。面颊也早就不疼了，他的皮肤很好，恢复能力也很强。\n\n    当蓝潇下午来接蓝轩宇放学的时�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
