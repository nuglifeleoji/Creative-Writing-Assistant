It evolves beyond you and is no longer accessible to you.\n“The oddest thing of all,” Taraza said, sinking into tune with this mood she had created, “is that the scientists of Ix cannot see how much their own beliefs dominate their universe.”\nTeg stared at her, silent and receptive.\n“Ixian beliefs are perfectly submissive to the choices they make on how they will look at their universe,” Taraza said. “Their universe does not act of itself but performs according to the kinds of experiments they choose.”\nWith a start, Teg came out of the memories and awoke to find himself in the Gammu Keep. He still sat in the familiar chair in his workroom. A glance around the room showed nothing moved from where he had put it. Only a few minutes had passed but the room and its contents no longer were alien. He dipped into and out of Mentat mode. Restored.\nThe smell and taste of the drink Taraza had given him so long ago still tingled on his tongue and in his nostrils. A Mentat blink and he knew he could call up the scene entire once more—the low light of shaded glowglobes, the feeling of the chair beneath him, the sounds of their voices. It was\nall there for replay, frozen into a time-capsule of isolated memory.\nCalling up that old memory created a magical universe where his abilities were amplified beyond his wildest expectations. No atoms existed in that magical universe, only waves and awesome movements all around. He was forced there to discard all barriers built of belief and understanding. This universe was transparent. He could see through it without any interfering screens upon which to project its forms. The magical universe reduced him to a core of active imagination where his own image-making abilities were the only screen upon which any projection might be sensed.\nThere, I am both the performer and the performed!\nThe workroom around Teg wavered into and out of his sensory reality. He felt his awareness constricted to its tightest purpose and yet that purpose filled his universe. He was open to infinity.\nTaraza did this deliberately! he thought. She has amplified me!\nA feeling of awe threatened him. He recognized how his daughter, Odrade, had drawn upon such powers to create the Atreides Manifesto for Taraza. His own Mentat powers were submerged in that greater pattern.\nTaraza was demanding a fearful performance from him. The need for such a thing both challenged and terrified him. It could very well mean the end of the Sisterhood.\nThe basic rule is this: Never support weakness; always support strength.\n—THE BENE GESSERIT CODA\nfd H ow is it that you can order the priests around?” Sheeana asked. “This is their place.”\nOdrade answered casually but picked her words to fit the knowledge she knew Sheeana already possessed: “The priests have Fremen roots. They’ve always had Reverend Mothers somewhere near. Besides, child, you order them around, too.”\n“That’s different.”\nOdrade suppressed a smile.\nLittle more than three hours had passed since her assault force had broken the attack on the temple complex. In that time, Odrade had set up a command center in Sheeana’s quarters, carried on the necessary business of assessment and preliminary retaliation, all the while prompting and observing Sheeana.\nSimulflow.\nOdrade glanced around the room she had chosen as command center. A scrap of Stiros’ ripped garments still lay near the wall in front of her. Casua/ties. The room was an oddly shaped place. No two walls parallel. She sniffed. Still a residual smell of ozone from the snoopers with which her people had assured the privacy of these quarters.\nWhy the odd shape? The building was ancient, remodeled and added to many times, but that did not explain this room. A pleasantly rough texture of creamy stucco on walls and ceiling. Elaborate spice-fiber hangings flanked the two doors. It was early evening and sunlight filtered by lattice\nshades stippled the wall opposite the windows. Silver-yellow glowglobes hovered near the ceiling, all tuned to match the sunlight. Muted street sounds came through the ventilators beneath the windows. The soft pattern of orange rugs and gray tiles on the floor spoke of wealth and security but Odrade suddenly did not feel secure.\nA tall Reverend Mother came from the adjoining communications room. “Mother Commander,” she said, “the messages have been sent to Guild, Ix, and Tleilaxu.”\nOdrade spoke absently. “Acknowledged.”\nThe messenger returned to her duties.\n“What are you doing?” Sheeana asked.\n“Studying something.”\nOdrade pursed her lips in thought. Their guides through the temple complex had brought them along a maze of hallways and stairs, glimpses of courtyards through arches, then into a splendid Ixian suspensor-tube system, which carried them silently to another hallway, more stairs, another curved hallway . .. finally, into this room.\nOnce more, Odrade swept her gaze around the room.\n“Why are you studying this room?” Sheeana asked.\n“Hush, child!”\nThe room was an irregular polyhedron with the smaller side to the left. About thirty-five meters long, half that at the widest. Many low divans and chairs in various degrees of comfort. Sheeana sat in queenly splendor on a bright yellow chair with wide soft arms. Not a chairdog in the place. Much brown and blue and yellow fabric. Odrade stared at the white lattice of a ventilator above a painting of mountains on the wider end wall. A cool breeze came through the ventilators below the windows and wafted toward the ventilator above the painting.\n“This was Hedley’s room,” Sheeana said.\n“Why do you annoy him by using his first name, child?”\n“Does that annoy him?”\n“Don’t play word games with me, child! You know it annoys him and that’s why you do it.”\n“Then why did you ask?”\nOdrade ignored this while continuing her careful study of the room. The wall opposite the painting stood at an oblique angle to the outer wall. She had it now. C/ever! This room had been constructed so that even a whisper here could be heard by someone beyond the high ventilator. No doubt the painting concealed another airway to carry sounds from this room. No snooper, sniffer, or other instrument would detect such an arrangement. Nothing would “beep” at a spying eye or ear. Only the wary senses of someone trained in deception had winkled it out.\nA hand signal summoned a waiting acolyte. Odrade’s fingers flickered in silent communication: “Find out who is listening beyond that ventilator.” She nodded toward the ventilator above the painting. “Let them continue. We must know to whom they report.”\n“How did you know to come and save me?” Sheeana asked.\nThe child had a lovely voice but it needed training, Odrade thought. There was a steadiness to it, though, that could be shaped into a powerful instrument.\n“Answer me!” Sheeana ordered.\nThe imperious tone startled Odrade, arousing quick anger, which she was forced to suppress. Corrections would have to be made immediately!\n“Calm yourself, child,” Odrade said. She pitched the command in a precise tenor and saw it take effect.\nAgain, Sheeana startled her: “That’s another kind of Voice. You’re trying to calm me. Kipuna told me all about Voice.”\nOdrade turned squarely facing Sheeana and looked down at her. Sheeana’s first grief had passed but there was still anger when she spoke of Kipuna.\n“lam busy shaping our response to that attack,” Odrade said. “Why do you distract me? | should think you would want them punished.”\n“What will you do to them? Tell me! What will you do?”\nA surprisingly vindictive child, Odrade thought. That would have to be curbed. Hatred was as dangerous an emotion as love. The capacity for hatred was the capacity for its opposite.\nOdrade said: “I have sent Guild, Ix, and Tleilaxu the message we always dispatch when we have been annoyed. Three words: ‘You will pay.’”\n“How will they pay?”\n“A proper Bene Gesserit punishment is being fashioned. They will feel the consequences of their behavior.”\n“But what will you do?”\n“In time, you may learn. You may even learn how we design our punishment. For now, there is no need that you know.”\nA sullen look came over Sheeana’s face. She said: “You’re not even angry. Annoyed. That’s what you said.”\n“Curb your impatience, child! There are things you do not understand.”\nThe Reverend Mother from the communications room returned, glanced once at Sheeana and spoke to Odrade. “Chapter House acknowledges receipt of your report. They approve your response.”\nWhen the Reverend Mother from communications remained standing there, Odrade said: “There is more?”\nA flickering glance to Sheeana spoke of the woman’s reservations. Odrade held up her right palm, the signal for silent communication.\nThe Reverend Mother responded, her fingers dancing with unleashed excitement: “Taraza’s message—The Tleilaxu are the pivotal element. Guild must be made to pay dearly for its melange. Shut down Rakian supply to them. Throw Guild and Ix together. They will overextend selves in face of\ncrushing competition from the Scattering. Ignore Fish Speakers for now. They fall with Ix. Master of Masters responds to us from Tleilaxu. He goes to Rakis. Trap him.”\nOdrade smiled softly to acknowledge that she understood. She watched the other woman leave the room. Not only did Chapter House agree with actions taken on Rakis, a suitable Bene Gesserit punishment had been fashioned with fascinating speed. Obviously Taraza and her advisors had anticipated this moment.\nOdrade allowed herself a sigh of relief. The message to Chapter House had been terse: an outline account of the attack, the list of the Sisterhood’s casualties, identification of the attackers and a confirming note to Taraza that Odrade already had transmitted the required warning to the guilty: “You will pay.”\nYes, those fool attackers now knew the hornet’s nest had been aroused. That would create fear—an essential part of the punishment.\nSheeana squirmed in her chair. Her attitude said she would now try a new approach. “One of your people said there were Face Dancers.” She gestured with her chin toward the roof.\nWhat a vast reservoir of ignorance this child was, Odrade thought. That emptiness would have to be filled. Face Dancers! Odrade thought about the bodies they had examined. The Tleilaxu had finally sent their Face Dancers into action. It was a test of the Bene Gesserit, of course. These new ones were extremely difficult to detect. They still gave off the characteristic smell of their unique pheromones, though. Odrade had sent that datum in her message to Chapter House.\nThe problem now was to keep the Bene Gesserit knowledge secret. Odrade summoned an acolyte messenger. Indicating the ventilator with a flick of her eyes, Odrade spoke silently with her fingers: “Kill those who listen!”\n“You are too interested in Voice, child,” Odrade said, speaking down to Sheeana in the chair. “Silence is a most valuable tool for learning.”\n“But could | learn Voice? | want to learn it.”\n“I am telling you to be silent and to learn by your silence.”\n“I command you to teach me Voice!”\nOdrade reflected on Kip", " The Tleilaxu had finally sent their Face Dancers into action.

Sheeana had established effective Voice control over most of those around her. The child had learned it on her own. An intermediate level Voice for a limited audience. She was a natural. Tuek and Cania and the others were frightened by Sheeana. Religious fantasies contributed to that fear, of course, but Sheeana’s mastery of Voice pitch and tone displayed an admirable unconscious selectivity.\nThe indicated response to Sheeana was obvious, Odrade knew. Honesty. It was a most powerful lure and it served more than one purpose.\n“lam here to teach you many things,” Odrade said, “but | do not do this at your command.”\n“Everyone obeys me!” Sheeana said.\nShe’s barely into puberty and already at Aristocrat level, Odrade thought. Gods of our own making! What can she become?\nSheeana slipped out of her chair and stood looking up at Odrade with a questioning expression. The child’s eyes were on a level with Odrade’s shoulders. Sheeana was going to be tall, a commanding presence. If she survived.\n“You answer some of my questions but you won’t answer others,” Sheeana said. “You said you’d been waiting for me but you won’t explain. Why won’t you obey me?”\n“A foolish question, child.”\n“Why do you keep calling me child?”\n“Are you not a child?”\n“I menstruate.”\n“But you're still a child.”\n“The priests obey me.”\n“They’re afraid of you.”\n“You aren't?”\n“No, I’m not.”\n“Good! It gets tiresome when people only fear you.”\n“The priests think you come from God.”\n“Don’t you think that?”\n“Why should I? We—” Odrade broke off as an acolyte messenger entered. The acolyte’s fingers danced in silent communication: “Four priests listened. They have been killed. All were minions of Tuek.”\nOdrade waved the messenger away.\n“She talks with her fingers,” Sheeana said. “How does she do that?”\n“You ask too many of the wrong questions, child. And you haven’t told me why I should consider you an instrument of God.”\n“Shaitan spares me. | walk on the desert and when Shaitan comes, | talk to him.”\n“Why do you call him Shaitan instead of Shai-hulud?”\n“Everybody asks that same stupid question!”\n“Then give me your stupid answer.”\nThe sullen expression returned to Sheeana’s face. “It’s because of how we met.”\n“And how did you meet?”\nSheeana tipped her head to one side and looked up at Odrade for a moment, then: “That’s a secret.”\n“And you know how to keep secrets?”\nSheeana straightened and nodded but Odrade saw uncertainty in the movement. The child knew when she was being led into an impossible position!\n“Excellent!” Odrade said. “The keeping of secrets is one of a Reverend Mother’s most essential teachings. I’m glad we won’t have to bother with that one.”\n“But | want to learn everything!”\nSuch petulance in her voice. Very poor emotional control.\n“You must teach me everything!” Sheeana insisted.\nTime for the whip, Odrade thought. Sheeana had spoken and postured sufficiently that even a fifth-grade acolyte could feel confident of controlling her now.\nUsing the full power of Voice, Odrade said: “Don’t take that tone with me, child! Not if you wish to learn anything!”\nSheeana went rigid. She was more than a minute absorbing what had happened to her and then relaxing. Presently, she smiled, a warm and open expression. “Oh, I’m so glad you came! It’s been so boring lately.”\nNothing surpasses the complexity of the human mind.\n—LETO II: DAR-ES-BALAT RECORDS\nhe Gammu night, often quickly foreboding in this\nlatitude, was almost two hours away. Gathering clouds Shadowed the Keep. At Lucilla’s command, Duncan had returned to the courtyard for an intense session of self- directed practice.\nLucilla observed from the parapet where she had first watched him.\nDuncan moved in the tumbling twists of the Bene Gesserit eightfold combat, hurling his body across the grass, rolling, flipping himself from side to side, darting up and then down.\nIt was a fine display of random dodging, Lucilla thought. She could see no predictable pattern in his movements and the speed was dazzling. He was almost sixteen SY and already coming onto the platform potential of his prana- bindu endowment.\nThe carefully controlled movements of his training exercises revealed so much! He had responded quickly when she first ordered these evening sessions. The initial step of her instructions from Taraza had been accomplished. The ghola loved her. No doubt of it. She was mother-fixed to him. And it had been accomplished without seriously weakening him, although Teg’s anxieties had been aroused.\nMy shadow is on this ghola but he is not a supplicant nor a dependent follower, she reassured herself. Teg worries about it for no reason.\nJust that morning, she had told Teg, “Wherever his strengths dictate, he continues to express himself freely.”\nTeg should see him right now, she thought. These new practice movements were largely Duncan’s own creation.\nLucilla suppressed a gasp of appreciation at a particularly nimble leap, which took Duncan almost to the center of the courtyard. The ghola was developing a nerve-muscle equilibrium that, given time, might be matched to a psychological equilibrium at least equal to Teg’s. The cultural impact of such an achievement would be awesome. Look at all those who gave instinctive allegiance to Teg and, through Teg, to the Sisterhood.\nWe have the Tyrant to thank for much of that, she thought.\nBefore Leto II, no widespread system of cultural adjustments had ever endured long enough to approach the balance that the Bene Gesserit held as an ideal. It was this equilibrium— “flowing along the blade of a sword’—that fascinated Lucilla. It was why she lent herself so unreservedly to a project whose total design she did not know, but which demanded of her a performance that instinct labeled repugnant.\nDuncan is so young!\nWhat the Sisterhood required of her next had been spelled out explicitly by Taraza: the Sexual Imprint. Only that morning, Lucilla had posed naked before her mirror, forming the attitudes and motions of face and body that she knew she would use to obey Taraza’s orders. In artificial repose, Lucilla had seen her own face appear like that of a prehistoric love goddess—opulent with flesh and the promise of softness into which an aroused male might hurl himself.\nIn her education, Lucilla had seen ancient statues from the First Times, little stone figures of human females with wide hips and sagging breasts that assured abundance for a\nsuckling infant. At will, Lucilla could produce a youthful simulation of that ancient form.\nIn the courtyard below Lucilla, Duncan paused a moment and appeared to be thinking out his next movements. Presently, he nodded to himself, leaped high and twisted in the air, landing like a springbok on one leg, which kicked him sideways into gyrations more akin to dance than to combat.\nLucilla drew her mouth into a tight line of resolution.\nSexual Imprint.\nThe secret of sex was no secret at all, she thought. The roots were attached to life itself. This explained, of course, why her first command-seduction for the Sisterhood had planted a male face in her memory. The Breeding Mistress had told her to expect this and not be alarmed by it. But Lucilla had realized then that the Sexual Imprint was a two- edged sword. You might learn to flow along the edge of the blade but you could be cut by it. Sometimes, when that male face of her first command-seduction returned unbidden into her mind, Lucilla felt confounded by it. The memory came so frequently at the peak of an intimate moment, forcing her to great efforts of concealment.\n“You are strengthened thus,” the Breeding Mistresses reassured her.\nStill, there were times when she felt that she had trivialized something better left a mystery.\nA feeling of sourness at what she must do swept over Lucilla. These evenings when she observed Duncan’s training sessions had been her favorite times each day. The lad’s muscular development showed such definite progress —moving in the growth of sensitive muscle and nerve links —all of the prana-bindu marvels for which the Sisterhood was so famous. The next step was almost upon her, though, and she no longer could sink into watchful appreciation of her charge.\nMiles Teg would come out presently, she knew. Duncan’s training would move again into the practice room with its more deadly weapons.\nTeg.\nOnce more, Lucilla wondered about him. She had felt herself more than once attracted to him in a particular way that she recognized immediately. An Imprinter enjoyed some latitude in selecting her own breeding partners, provided she had no prior commitments nor contrary orders. Teg was old but his records suggested he might still be virile. She would not be able to keep the child, of course, but she had learned to deal with that.\nWhy not? she had asked herself.\nHer plan had been simple in the extreme. Complete the Imprint on the ghola and then, registering her intent with Taraza, conceive a child by the redoubtable Miles Teg. Practical introductory seduction had been indicated, but Teg had not succumbed. His Mentat cynicism stopped her one afternoon in the dressing chamber off the Weapons Room.\n“My breeding days are over, Lucilla. The Sisterhood should be satisfied with what | already have given.”\nTeg, clad only in black exercise leotards, finished wiping his sweaty face with a towel and dropped the towel into a hamper. He spoke without looking at her: “Would you please leave me now?”\nSo he saw through her overtures!\nShe should have anticipated that, Teg being who he was. Lucilla knew she might still seduce him. No Reverend Mother of her training should fail, not even with a Mentat of Teg’s obvious powers.\nLucilla stood there a moment undecided, her mind automatically planning how to circumvent this preliminary rejection. Something stopped her. Not anger at the rejection, not the remote possibility that he might indeed be proof against her wiles. Pride and its possible fall (there was always that possibility) had little to do with it.\nDignity.\nThere was a quiet dignity in Teg and she had the certain knowledge of what his courage and prowess had already given to the Sisterhood. Not quite sure of her motives, Lucilla turned away from him. Possibly it was the underlying gratitude that the Sisterhood felt toward him. To seduce", " hamper.

To seduce Teg now would be demeaning, not only of him but of herself. She could not bring herself to such an action, not without a direct order from a superior.\nAs she stood on the parapet, some of these memories clouded her senses. There was movement in the shadows at the doorway from the Weapons Wing. Teg could be glimpsed there. Lucilla took a firmer grip on her responses and focused on Duncan. The ghola had stopped his controlled tumbling across the lawn. He stood quietly, breathing deeply, his attention aimed upward at Lucilla. She saw perspiration on his face and in dark blotchings on his light blue singlesuit.\nLeaning over the parapet, Lucilla called down to him: “That was very good, Duncan. Tomorrow, | will begin teaching you more of the foot-fist combinations.”\nThe words came out of her without censoring and she knew their source at once. They were for Teg standing in the Shadowed doorway down there, not for the ghola. She was saying to Teg: “See! You aren’t the only one who teaches him deadly abilities.”\nLucilla realized then that Teg had insinuated himself further into her psyche than she should permit. Grimly, she swung her gaze to the tall figure emerging from the doorway’s shadows. Duncan already was running toward the Bashar.\nAs Lucilla focused on Teg, reaction flashed through her ignited by the most elemental Bene Gesserit responses. The steps of this reaction could be defined later: Something wrong! Danger! Teg is not Teg! In the reactive flash,\nhowever, none of this took separate form. She responded, hurling all the volume of Voice she could muster:\n“Duncan! Down!”\nDuncan dropped flat on the grass, his attention riveted to the Teg-figure emerging from the Weapons Wing. There was a field-model lasgun in the man’s hands.\nFace Dancer! Lucilla thought. Only hyperalertness revealed him to her. One of the new ones!\n“Face Dancer!” Lucilla shouted.\nDuncan kicked himself sideways and leaped up, twisting flat in the air at least a meter off the ground. The speed of his reaction shocked Lucilla. She had not known any human could move that fast! The lasgun’s first bolt cut beneath Duncan as he seemed to float in the air.\nLucilla jumped to the parapet and dropped to a handhold on the window ledge of the next lower level. Before she was stopped, her right hand shot out and found the protruding rainspout that memory told her was there. Her body arched sideways and she dropped to a window ledge at the next level. Desperation drove her even though she knew she would be too late.\nSomething crackled on the wall above her. She saw a molten line cut toward her as she flung herself to the left, twisting and dropping onto the lawn. Her gaze captured the scene around her in a flashing deit-grasp as she landed.\nDuncan moved toward the attacker, dodging and twisting in a terrifying replay of his practice session. The speed of his movements!\nLucilla saw indecision in the face of the false Teg.\nShe darted toward the Face Dancer, feeling the creature’s thoughts: Two of them after me!\nFailure was inevitable, though, and Lucilla knew it even as she ran. The Face Dancer had only to shift his weapon into full burn at close range. He could lace the air in front of him. Nothing could penetrate such a defense. As she cast about in her mind, desperately seeking some way to defeat the\nattacker, she saw red smoke appear on the false Teg’s breast. A line of red darted upward at an oblique angle through the muscles of the arm holding the lasgun. The arm fell away like a piece dropping from a statue. The shoulder tipped away from the torso in a spout of blood. The figure toppled, dissolving into more red smoke and blood spray, crumbling into pieces on the steps, all dark tans and blue- tinged reds.\nLucilla smelled the distinctive Face Dancer pheromones as she stopped. Duncan came up beside her. He peered past the dead Face Dancer at movement in the hallway.\nAnother Teg emerged behind the dead one. Lucilla identified the reality: Teg himself.\n“That’s the Bashar,” Duncan said.\nLucilla experienced a small surge of pleasure that Duncan had learned this identity-lesson so well: how to recognize your friends even if you only saw bits of them. She pointed to the dead Face Dancer. “Smell him.”\nDuncan inhaled. “Yes, | have it. But he wasn’t a very good copy. | saw what he was as soon as you did.”\nTeg emerged into the courtyard carrying a heavy lasgun cradled across his left arm. His right hand held a firm grip on the stock and trigger. He swept his gaze around the courtyard, then focused on Duncan and finally on Lucilla.\n“Bring Duncan inside,” Teg said.\nIt was the order of a battlefield commander, depending only on superior knowledge of what should be done in the emergency. Lucilla obeyed without question.\nDuncan did not speak as she led him by the hand past the bloody meat that had been the Face Dancer, then into the Weapons Wing. Once inside, he glanced back at the sodden heap and asked: “Who let him in?”\nNot: “How did he get in?” she observed. Duncan already had seen past the inconsequentials to the heart of their problem.\nTeg strode ahead of them toward his own quarters. He stopped at the door, glanced inside and motioned for Lucilla and Duncan to follow.\nIn Teg’s bedroom there was the thick smell of burned flesh and wisps of smoke dominated by the charred barbecue odor that Lucilla so detested: cooked human meat! A figure in one of Teg’s uniforms lay face down on the floor where it had fallen off his bed.\nTeg rolled the figure over with one boot toe, exposing the face: staring eyes, a rictus grin. Lucilla recognized one of the perimeter guards, one of those who had come to the Keep with Schwangyu, so the Keep’s records said.\n“Their point man,” Teg said. “Patrin took care of him and we put one of my uniforms on him. It was enough to fool the Face Dancers because we didn’t let them see the face before we attacked. They didn’t have time to make a memory print.”\n“You know about that?” Lucilla was startled.\n“Bellonda briefed me thoroughly!”\nAbruptly, Lucilla saw the further significance of what Teg said. She suppressed a swift flare of anger. “How did you let one of them get into the courtyard?”\nHis voice mild, Teg said: “There was rather urgent activity in here. | had to make a choice, which turned out to be the right one.”\nShe did not try to hide her anger. “The choice to let Duncan fend for himself?”\n“To leave him in your care or let other attackers get themselves firmly entrenched inside. Patrin and | had a bad time clearing this wing. We had our hands full.” Teg glanced at Duncan. “He came through very well, thanks to our training.”\n“That... that thing almost got him!”\n“Lucilla!” Teg shook his head. “I had it timed. You two could last at least a minute out there. | knew you would\nthrow yourself in that thing’s path and sacrifice yourself to save Duncan. Another twenty seconds.”\nAt Teg’s words, Duncan turned a shiny-eyed look on Lucilla. “Would you have done that?”\nWhen Lucilla did not respond, Teg said: “She would have done that.”\nLucilla did not deny it. She remembered now, though, the incredible speed with which Duncan had moved, the dazzling shifts of his attack.\n“Battle decisions,” Teg said, looking at Lucilla.\nShe accepted this. As usual, Teg had made the correct choice. She knew, though, that she would have to communicate with Taraza. The prana-bindu accelerations in this ghola went beyond anything she had expected. She stiffened as Teg straightened to full alert, his gaze on the doorway behind her. Lucilla whirled.\nSchwangyu stood there, Patrin behind her, another heavy lasgun over his arm. Its muzzle, Lucilla noted, was aimed at Schwangyu.\n“She insisted,” Patrin said. There was an angry set to the old aide’s face. The deep lines beside his mouth pointed downward.\n“There’s a trail of bodies clear out to the south pillbox,” Schwangyu said. “Your people won’t let me out there to inspect. | command you to countermand those orders immediately.”\n“Not until my clean-up crews are finished,” Teg said.\n“They’re still killing people out there! | can hear it!” A venomous edge had entered Schwangyu’s voice. She glared at Lucilla.\n“We're also questioning people out there,” Teg said.\nSchwangyu shifted her glare to Teg. “If it’s too dangerous here then we will take the . . . the child to my quarters. Now!”\n“We will not do that,” Teg said. His tone was low-key but positive.\nSchwangyu stiffened with displeasure. Patrin’s knuckles went white on the stock of his lasgun. Schwangyu swung her gaze past the gun and up to Lucilla’s appraising stare. The two women looked into each other’s eyes.\nTeg allowed the moment to hold for a beat, then said: “Lucilla, take Duncan into my sitting room.” He nodded toward a door behind him.\nLucilla obeyed, pointedly keeping her body between Schwangyu and Duncan the whole time.\nOnce behind the closed door, Duncan said: “She almost called me ‘the ghola.’ She’s really upset.”\n“Schwangyu has let several things slip past her guard,” Lucilla said.\nShe glanced around Teg’s sitting room, her first view of this part of his quarters: the Bashar’s inner sanctum. It reminded her of her own quarters—that same mixture of orderliness and casual disarray. Reading spools lay ina clutter on a small table beside an old-fashioned chair upholstered in soft gray. The spool reader had been swung aside as though its user had just stepped out for a moment, intending to return soon. A Bashar’s black uniform jacket lay across a nearby hard chair with sewing material in a small open box atop it. The jacket’s cuff showed a carefully patched hole.\nSo he does his own mending.\nThis was an aspect of the famous Miles Teg she had not expected. If she had thought about it, she would have said Patrin would absorb such chores.\n“Schwangyu let the attackers in, didn’t she?” Duncan asked.\n“Her people did.” Lucilla did not hide her anger. “She has gone too far"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_c85288e62bb7a09f0608b257547fec8969452525cee8491b24a320ba4580f1df_v2"}
