却说魏国因旧岁有青龙自摩坡井内而出，改为青龙元年；此时乃青龙二年春二月也。近臣奏曰：“边官飞报蜀兵三十余万，分五路复出祁山。魏主曹睿大惊，急召司马懿至，谓曰：“蜀人三年不曾入寇；今诸葛亮又出祁山，如之奈何？”懿奏曰：“臣夜观天象，见中原旺气正盛，奎星犯太白，不利于西川。今孔明自负才智，逆天而行，乃自取败亡也。臣托陛下洪福，当往破之。但愿保四人同去。”睿曰：“卿保何人？”懿曰：“夏侯渊有四子：长名霸，字仲权；次名威，字季权；三名惠，字稚权；四名和，字义权。霸、威二人，弓马熟娴；惠、和二人，谙知韬略：此四人常欲为父报仇。臣今保夏侯霸、夏侯威为左右先锋，夏侯惠；夏侯和为行军司马，共赞军机，以退蜀兵。”睿曰：“向者夏侯楙驸马违误军机，失陷了许多人马，至今羞惭不回。今此四人，亦与楙同否？”懿曰：“此四人非夏侯楙所可比也。”睿乃从其请，即命司马懿为大都督，凡将士悉听量才委用，各处兵马皆听调遣。\n\n    懿受命，辞朝出城。睿又以手诏赐懿曰：“卿到渭滨，宜坚壁固守，勿与交锋。蜀兵不得志，必诈退诱敌，卿慎勿追。待彼粮尽，必将自走，然后乘虚攻之，则取胜不难，亦免军马疲劳之苦：计莫善于此也。”司马懿顿首受诏，即日到长安，聚集各处军马共四十万，皆来渭滨下寨；又拨五万军，于渭水上搭起九座浮桥，令先锋夏侯霸、夏侯威过渭水安营；又于大营之后东原，筑起一城，以防不虞。\n\n    懿正与众将商议间，忽报郭淮、孙礼来见。懿迎入，礼毕，淮曰：“今蜀兵现在祁山，倘跨渭登原，接连北山，阻绝陇道，大可虞也。”懿曰：“所言甚善。公可就总督陇西军马，据北原下寨，深沟高垒，按兵休动；只待彼兵粮尽，方可攻之。”郭淮、孙礼领命，引兵下寨去了。\n\n    却说孔明复出祁山，下五个大寨，按左、右、中、前、后；自斜谷直至剑阁，一连又下十四个大寨，分屯军马，以为久计。每日令人巡哨。忽报郭淮、孙礼领陇西之兵，于北原下寨。孔明谓诸将曰：“魏兵于北原安营者，惧吾取此路，阻绝陇道也\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
