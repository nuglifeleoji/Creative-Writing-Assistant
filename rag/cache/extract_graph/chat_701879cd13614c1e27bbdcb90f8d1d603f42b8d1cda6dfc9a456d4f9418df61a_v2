Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart—water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.”\nHalleck opened his eyes. “I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”\n“I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. | can only help you meet today.”\n“Then l'Il accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who—”\n“Listen to me, fighting man,” Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler’s face was suddenly like weathered stone. “My father’s water—l’ll buy that back myself, with my own blade.”\nHalleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the Smuggler reminded him of Duke Leto: a leader of men, Courageous, secure in his own position and his own course. He was like the Duke...before Arrakis.\n“Do you wish my blade beside you?” Halleck asked.\nTuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.\n“Do you think of me as fighting man?” Halleck pressed.\n“You're the only one of the Duke’s lieutenants to escape,” Tuek said. “Your enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him.... You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis.”\n“Ene.\n“We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,” Tuek said. “Arrakis is our enemy.”\n“One enemy ata time, is that it?”\n“That’s it.”\n“Is that the way the Fremen make out?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“You said | might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the desert, in the open, is that why?”\n“Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man’s land. But | wish to talk more about—”\n“I'm told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,” Halleck said. “But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look.”\n“Rumors!” Tuek sneered. “Do you wish to choose now between me and the Fremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock, our own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few ragged bands that we use as spice-hunters.”\n“But they can kill Harkonnens.”\n“And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down like animals—with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being exterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens.”\n“Was it Harkonnens they killed?” Halleck asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Haven’t you heard that there may’ve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?”\n“More rumors.”\n“But a pogrom—that isn’t like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful.”\n“I believe what | see with my own eyes,” Tuek said. “Make your choice, fighting man. Me or the Fremen. | will promise you sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted.”\nHalleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek’s words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain.\n“Trust your own abilities,” Tuek said. “Whose decisions brought your force through the battle? Yours. Decide.”\n“It must be,” Halleck said. “The Duke and his son are dead?”\n“The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, | incline to trust the Harkonnens.” A grim smile touched Tuek’s mouth. “But it’s about the only trust | give them.”\n“Then it must be,” Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. “I give you my sword.”\n“Accepted.”\n“Do you wish me to persuade my men?”\n“You'd let them make their own decision?”\n“They’ve followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn’t what they thought it’d be. Here, they’ve lost everything except their lives. I'd prefer they decided for themselves now.”\n“Now is no time for you to falter,” Tuek said. “They've followed you this far.”\n“You need them, is that it?”\n“We can always use experienced fighting men...in these times more than ever.”\n“You’ve accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?”\n“I think they'll follow you, Gurney Halleck.”\n“Tis to be hoped.”\n“Indeed.”\n“I may make my own decision in this, then?”\n“Your own decision.”\nHalleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required. “For now, l'Il see to their quarters and well-being,” he said.\n“Consult my quartermaster,” Tuek said. “Drisq is his name. Tell him it’s my wish that you receive every courtesy. l'Il join you myself presently. I’ve some off- Shipments of spice to see to first.”\n“Fortune passes everywhere,” Halleck said.\n“Everywhere,” Tuek said. “A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business.”\nHalleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the office.\nHe found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by Tuek’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air-\nconvection currents. Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls.\nHalleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing—no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.\nThe Atreides training— “We care for our own!’”—it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted. One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck’s nine-string baliset out of its case. The man\nSnapped a Salute, said: “Sir, the medics here say there’s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here—only outpost medicine. Mattal can’t last, they say, and he has a request of you.”\n“What is it?”\nThe lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. “Mattai wants a song to ease his going, sir. He says you'll know the one...he’s asked it of you often enough.” The lieutenant swallowed. “It’s the one called ‘My Woman,’ sir. If you—”\n“I know.” Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone had already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile Casually.\nSeveral of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters. One of the men began\nSinging softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:\n“My woman stands at her window, Curved lines ‘’gainst square glass. Uprais’d arms...bent...downfolded. ’Gainst sunset red and golded— Come to me...\nCome to me, warm arms of my lass. For me...\nFor me, the warm arms of my lass.”\nThe singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter.\nHalleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are seventy-three.\nFamily life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, | think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic- eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and | was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I’m not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new Slave-concubine, then, red- haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer’s muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: “She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift.” You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\naul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in the tent.\nFolds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their Shelter. Away from the setting sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night.\nAnd the flatness.\nHis mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no persuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that horizon—no bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze...only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a Sky of burnished silver-blue.\nWhat if there isn’t one of the abandoned testing stations across there? he wondered. What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?\nWithin the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul. He stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away.\nPresently\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_701879cd13614c1e27bbdcb90f8d1d603f42b8d1cda6dfc9a456d4f9418df61a_v2"}
