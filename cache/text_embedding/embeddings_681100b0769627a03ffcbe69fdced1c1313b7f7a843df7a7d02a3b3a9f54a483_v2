He glanced through open windows of the flag-topped building on his right. The Atreides banner flying over that? The window opened into an auditorium with a low ceiling, a bandshell at the far end enclosing a small platform. He saw rows of seats, maroon carpeting on the floor. It had all the look of a stage setting, a place to entertain tourists.\nThe sound of shuffling feet brought Idaho’s attention back to Garun. Children were pressing forward around the delegation, extending clumps of garish red flowers in their grimy hands. The flowers were wilted.\nGarun addressed himself to Siona, correctly identifying the gold piping of Fish Speaker Command in her uniform.\n“Will you wish a performance of our Fremen rituals?” he asked. “The music, perhaps? The dance?”\nNayla accepted a bunch of flowers from one of the children, sniffed them and sneezed.\nAnother urchin extended flowers toward Siona, lifting a wide-eyed stare toward her. She accepted the flowers without looking at the child. Idaho merely waved the children aside as they approached him. They hesitated, staring up at him, then scurried around him toward the rest of the troop.\nGarun spoke to Idaho. “If you give them a few coins, they will not bother you.”\nIdaho shuddered. Was this the training for Fremen children?\nGarun returned his attention to Siona. With Nayla listening, Garun began explaining the layout of his village.\nIdaho moved away from them down the street, noting how glances flicked toward him and then avoided his gaze. He felt deeply offended by the surface decorations on the buildings, none of it disguising the evidence of decay. He stared in an open doorway at the auditorium. There was a harshness in Tuono, a struggling something behind the wilting flowers and the servile tone of Garun’s voice. In\nanother time and on another planet, this would have been a donkey-in-the-street village—rope-belted peasants pressing forward with petitions. He could hear the whine of supplication in Garun’s voice. These were not Fremen! These poor creatures lived on the margins, trying to retain parts of an ancient wholeness. And all the while, that lost reality slipped farther and farther from their grasp. What had Leto created here? These Museum Fremen were lost to everything except a bare existence and the rote mouthing of old words which they did not understand and which they did not even pronounce correctly!\nReturning to Siona, Idaho bent to study the cut of Garun’s brown robe, seeing a tightness in it dictated by a need to conserve fabric. The gray slick of a stillsuit could be seen underneath, exposed to sunlight which no real Fremen would ever have let touch his stillsuit that way. Idaho looked at the rest of the delegation, noting an identical parsimonious treatment of fabric. It betrayed their emotional bent. Such garments allowed no expansive gestures, no freedom of movement. The robes were tight and confining in the way of these entire people!\nDisgust propelling him, Idaho strode forward abruptly and parted Garun’s robe to look at the stillsuit. Just as he suspected! The suit was another sham—no arms to it, no boot-pumps!\nGarun pulled back, putting a hand to the knife hilt Idaho had exposed at the man’s belt. “Here! What’re you doing?” Garun demanded, his voice querulous. “You don’t touch a Fremen thus!”\n“You, a Fremen?” Idaho demanded. “I lived with Fremen! | fought by their sides against Harkonnens! | died with Fremen! You? You’re a sham!”\nGarun’s knuckles went white on the knife haft. He addressed himself to Siona. “Who is this man?”\nNayla spoke up: “This is Duncan Idaho.”\n“The ghola?” Garun turned to look at Idaho’s face. “We have never seen your like here before.”\nIdaho felt himself almost overcome with desire to cleanse this place even if it cost him his life, this diminished life which could be repeated endlessly by people who had no real concerns for him. An o/der model, yes! But this was no Fremen.\n“Draw that knife or take your hand off it,” Idaho said. Garun jerked his hand away from the knife. “It is not a real knife,” he said. “Only for decoration.” His voice became eager. “But we have real knives, even crysknives! They are\nkept locked in the display cases to preserve them.”\nIdaho could not help himself. He threw his head back in laughter. Siona smiled, but Nayla looked thoughtful and the rest of the Fish Speaker troop drew into a close, watchful circle around them.\nThe laughter had an odd effect on Garun. He lowered his head and clasped his hands tightly together, but not before Idaho saw them trembling. When Garun peered upward once more, it was to look at Idaho from beneath heavy brows. Idaho felt abruptly sobered. It was as though some terrible boot had crushed Garun’s ego into fearful subservience. There was watchful waiting in the man’s eyes. And for no reason he could explain, Idaho remembered a passage from the Orange Catholic Bible. He asked himself: Are these the meek who will outwait us all and inherit the universe?\nGarun cleared his throat, then: “Perhaps the ghola Duncan Idaho will witness our ways and our ritual and judge them?”\nIdaho felt shamed by the plaintive request. He spoke without thinking: “I will teach you anything Fremen that | know.” He looked up to see Nayla scowling at him. “It will help to pass the time,” he said. “And who knows? It may return something of the true Fremen to this land.”\nSiona said: “We've no need to play old cultish games! Take us to our quarters.”\nNayla lowered her head in embarrassment and spoke without looking at Siona. “Commander, there is a thing | have not ventured to tell you.”\n“That you must make sure we stay in this filthy place,” Siona said.\n“Oh, no!” Nayla looked up at Siona’s face. “Where could you go? The Wall cannot be climbed and there is only the river beyond it, anyway. And in the other direction, it is the Sareer. Oh, no... it is something else.” Nayla shook her head.\n“Out with it!” Siona snapped.\n“lam under the strictest orders, Commander, which | dare not disobey.” Nayla glanced at the other members of the troop then back to Siona. “You and the... Duncan Idaho are to be quartered together.”\n“My father’s orders?”\n“Lady Commander, they are said to be the orders of the God Emperor himself and we dare not disobey.”\nSiona looked full at Idaho. “You will remember my warning, Duncan, when last we spoke at the Citadel?”\n“My hands are mine to do with as | wish,” Idaho snarled. “| don’t think you have any doubts about my wishes!”\nShe turned away from him after a curt nod and looked at Garun. “What does it matter where we bed in this disgusting place? Take us to our quarters.”\nIdaho found Garun’s response fascinating—a turning of the head toward the ghola, shielding the face behind the Fremen hood, then a secret conspiratorial wink. Only then did Garun lead them away down the dirty street.\nWhat is the most immediate danger to my stewardship? | will tell you. It is a true visionary, a person who has stood in the presence of God with the full knowledge of where he stands. Visionary ecstasy releases energies which are like the energies of sex—uncaring for anything except creation. One act of creation can be much like another. Everything depends upon the vision.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\neto lay without his cart on the high, sheltered balcony of\nhis Little Citadel tower, subduing a fretfulness which he knew came from the necessary delays putting off the date of his wedding to Hwi Noree. He stared toward the southwest. Somewhere off there beyond the darkening horizon, the Duncan, Siona and their companions had been six days in Tuono Village.\nThe delays are my own fault, Leto thought. / am the one who changed the place for the wedding, making it necessary for poor Moneo to revise all of his preparations.\nAnd now, of course, there was the matter of Malky.\nNone of these necessities could be explained to Moneo, who could be heard stirring about within the central chamber of the aerie, worrying about his absence from the command post where he directed the festive preparations. Moneo was such a worrier!\nLeto looked toward the setting sun. It floated low to the horizon, faded a dim orange by a recent storm. Rain crouched low in the clouds to the south beyond the Sareer now. In a prolonged silence, Leto had watched the rain there for a time which had stretched out with no beginning or end. The clouds had grown out of a hard gray sky, rain walking in visible lines. He had felt himself clothed in memories that\ncame unbidden. The mood was hard to shake off and, without even thinking, he muttered the remembered lines of an ancient verse.\n“Did you speak, Lord?” Moneo’s voice came from close beside Leto. By merely turning his eyes, Leto could see the faithful majordomo standing attentively waiting.\nLeto translated into Galach as he quoted: “The nightingale nests in the plum tree, but what will she do with the wind?”\n“Is that a question, Lord?”\n“An old question. The answer is simple. Let the nightingale keep to her flowers.”\n“| don’t understand, Lord.”\n“Stop mouthing the obvious, Moneo. It disturbs me when you do that.”\n“Forgive me, Lord.”\n“What else can | do?” Leto studied Moneo’s downcast features. “You and |, Moneo, whatever else we do, we provide good theater.”\nMoneo peered at Leto’s face. “Lord?”\n“The rites of the religious festival of Bacchus were the seeds of Greek theater, Moneo. Religion often leads to theater. They will have fine theater out of us.” Once more, Leto turned and looked at the southwest horizon.\nThere was a wind there now piling up the clouds. Leto thought he could hear driven sand blustering along the dunes, but there was only resonant quiet in the tower aerie, a quiet with the faintest of wind hiss behind it.\n“The clouds,” he whispered. “I would take a cup of moonlight once more, an ancient sea barge at my feet, thin clouds clinging to my darkling sky, the blue-gray cloak around my shoulders and horses neighing nearby.”\n“My Lord is troubled,” Moneo said. The compassion in his voice wrenched at Leto.\n“The bright shadows of my pasts,” Leto said. “They never leave me in peace. | listened for a soothing sound, the bell\nof a country town at nightfall, and it told me only that | am the sound and soul of this place.”\nAs he spoke, darkness enclosed the tower. Automatic lights came on around them. Leto kept his attention directed outward where a thin melon slice of First Moon drifted above the clouds with orange planet-light revealing the satellite’s full circle.\n“Lord, why have we come out here?” Moneo asked. “Why won't you tell me?”\n“I wanted the benefit of your surprise,” Leto said. “A Guild lighter will land beside us out here soon. My Fish Speakers bring Malky", " feet, thin clouds clinging to my darkling sky, the blue-gray cloak around my shoulders and horses neighing nearby.”\n“My Lord is troubled,” Moneo said. The compassion in his voice wrenched at Leto.\n“The bright shadows of my pasts,” Leto said. “They never leave me in peace. | listened for a soothing sound, the bell\nof a country town at nightfall, and it told me only that | am the sound and soul of this place.”\nAs he spoke, darkness enclosed the tower.

My Fish Speakers bring Malky to me.”\nMoneo inhaled a quick breath and held it a moment before exhaling. “Hwi’s ... uncle? That Malky?”\n“You are surprised that you had no warning of this,” Leto said.\nMoneo felt a chill all through his body. “Lord, when you wish to keep things secret from...”\n“Moneo?” Leto spoke in a softly persuasive tone. “I know that Malky offered you greater temptations than any other...”\n“Lord! I never...”\n“I know that, Moneo.” Still in that soft tone. “But surprise has shocked your memories alive. You are armed for anything | may require of you.”\n“What... what does my Lord...”\n“Perhaps we will have to dispose of Malky. He is a problem.”\n“Me? You want meto...”\n“Perhaps.”\nMoneo swallowed, then: “The Reverend Mother...”\n“Anteac is dead. She served me well, but she is dead. There was extreme violence when my Fish Speakers attacked the... place where Malky lay hidden.”\n“We are better off without Anteac,” Moneo said.\n“| appreciate your distrust of the Bene Gesserit, but | would that Anteac had left us in another way. She was faithful to us, Moneo.”\n“A Reverend Mother was...”\n“Both the Bene Tleilax and the Guild wanted Malky’s secret,” Leto said. “When they saw us move against the Ixians, they struck ahead of my Fish Speakers. Anteac... well, she could only delay them a bit, but it was enough. My Fish Speakers invested the place...”\n“Malky’s secret, Lord?”\n“When a thing vanishes,” Leto said, “that is as much of a message as when a thing suddenly appears. The empty Spaces are always worthy of our study.”\n“What does my Lord mean, empty...”\n“Malky did not die! Certainly | would have known that. Where did he go when he vanished?”\n“Vanished ... from you, Lord? Do you mean that the Ixians...”\n“They have improved upon a device they gave me long ago. They improved it slowly and subtly, hidden shells within hidden shells, but | noted the shadows. | was surprised. | was pleased.”\nMoneo thought about this. A device which concealed... Ahhhh! The God Emperor had mentioned a thing on several occasions, a way of concealing the thoughts he recorded. Moneo spoke:\n“And Malky brings the secret of .. .”\n“Oh, yes! But that is not Malky’s real secret. He holds another thing in his bosom which he does not think that | Suspect.”\n“Another... but, Lord, if they can hide even from you...”\n“Many can do that now, Moneo. They scattered when my Fish Speakers attacked. The secret of the Ixian device is spread far and wide.”\nMoneo’s eyes went wide with alarm. “Lord, if anyone...”\n“If they learn to be clever, they will leave no tracks,” Leto said. “Tell me, Moneo, what does Nayla say about the Duncan? Does she resent reporting directly to you?”\n“Whatever my Lord commands . . .” Moneo cleared his throat. He could not fathom why his God Emperor spoke of hidden tracks, the Duncan and Nayla in the same breath.\n“Yes, of course,” Leto said. “Whatever | command, Nayla obeys. And what does she say of the Duncan?”\n“He has not tried to breed with Siona, if that is my Lord’s...”\n“But what does he do with my puppet Naib, Garun, and the other Museum Fremen?”\n“He speaks to them of the old ways, of the wars against the Harkonnens, of the first Atreides here on Arrakis.”\n“On Dune!”\n“Dune, yes.”\n“It’s because there’s no more Dune that there are no more Fremen,” Leto said. “Have you conveyed my message to Nayla?”\n“Lord, why do you add to your peril?”\n“Did you convey my message?”\n“The messenger has been sent to Tuono, but | could still call her back.”\n“You will not call her back!”\n“But, Lord...”\n“What will she say to Nayla?”\n“That... that it is your command for Nayla to continue in absolute and unquestioning obedience of my daughter except insofar... Lord! This is dangerous!”\n“Dangerous? Nayla is a Fish Speaker. She will obey me.”\n“But Siona... Lord, | fear that my daughter does not serve you with all of her heart. And Nayla is...”\n“Nayla must not deviate.”\n“Lord, let us hold your wedding in some other place.”\n“No!”\n“Lord, | know that your vision has revealed...”\n“The Golden Path endures, Moneo. You know that as well as |.”\nMoneo sighed. “Infinity is yours, Lord. | do not question the...” He broke off as a monstrous shuddering roar shook the tower, louder and louder.\nBoth of them turned toward the sound—a descending plume of blue-orange light filled with swirling shockwaves came down to the desert less than a kilometer away to the south.\n“Ahhh, my guest arrives,” Leto said. “I will send you down on my cart, Moneo. Bring only Malky back with you. Tell the Guildsmen this has earned my forgiveness, then send them away.”\n“Your for... yes, Lord. But if they have the secret of...”\n“They serve my purpose, Moneo. You must do the same. Bring Malky to me.”\nObediently, Moneo went to the cart which lay in shadows at the far side of the aerie chamber. He clambered on it, watched a mouth of night appear in the Wall. A landing-lip extruded into that night. The cart drifted outward, feather- light, and floated at an angle to the sand beside a Guild lighter which stood upright like a distorted miniature of the Little Citadel’s tower.\nLeto watched from the balcony, his front segments lifted Slightly to provide him a better viewing angle. His acute eyesight identified the white movement of Moneo standing on the cart in the moonlight. Long-legged Guild servitors came out with a litter which they slid onto the cart, standing there a moment in conversation with Moneo. When they left, Leto closed the cart’s bubble cover and saw moonlight reflected from it. At his beckoning thought, the cart and its burden returned to the landing-lip. The Guild lighter lifted in its noisy rumbling while Leto was bringing the cart into the chamber’s lights, closing the entrance behind it. Leto opened the bubble cover. Sand grated beneath him as he rolled to the litter and lifted his front segments to peer in at\nMalky who lay as though sleeping, lashed into the litter by broad gray elastic bindings. The man’s face was ashen under dark gray hair.\nHow he has aged, Leto thought.\nMoneo stepped down off the cart and looked back at the litter’s occupant. “He is injured, Lord. They want to send a medical...”\n“They wanted to send a spy.”\nLeto studied Malky—the dark wrinkled skin, the sunken cheeks, that sharp nose at such contrast with the rounded oval of his face. The heavy eyebrows had turned almost white. There but for a lifetime of testosterone... yes.\nMalky’s eyes opened. Such a shock to find evil in those doe-like brown eyes! A smile twitched Malky’s mouth.\n“Lord Leto.” Malky’s voice was little more than a husky whisper. His eyes turned right, focusing on the majordomo. “And Moneo. Forgive me for not rising to the occasion.”\n“Are you in pain?” Leto asked.\n“Sometimes.” Malky’s eyes moved to study his Surroundings. “Where are the houris?”\n“I’m afraid | must deny you that pleasure, Malky.”\n“Just as well,” Malky husked. “I don’t really feel up to their demands. Those were not houris you sent after me, Leto.”\n“They were professional in their obedience to me,” Leto said.\n“They were bloody hunters!”\n“Anteac was the hunter. My Fish Speakers were merely the clean-up crew.”\nMoneo shifted his attention from one speaker to the other, back and forth. There were disturbing undertones in this conversation. Despite the huskiness, Malky sounded almost flippant... but then he had always been that way. A dangerous man!\nLeto said: “Just before your arrival, Moneo and | were discussing Infinity.”\n“Poor Moneo,” Malky said.\nLeto smiled. “Do you remember, Malky? You once asked me to demonstrate Infinity.”\n“You said no Infinity exists to be demonstrated.” Malky swept his gaze toward Moneo. “Leto likes to play with paradox. He knows all the tricks of language that have ever been discovered.”\nMoneo put down a surge of anger. He felt excluded from this conversation, an object of amusement by two superior beings. Malky and the God Emperor were almost like two old friends reliving the pleasures of a mutual past.\n“Moneo accuses me of being the sole possessor of Infinity,” Leto said. “He refuses to believe that he has just as much of Infinity as | have.”\nMalky stared up at Leto. “You see, Moneo? You see how tricky he is with words?”\n“Tell me about your niece, Hwi Noree,” Leto said.\n“Is it true, Leto, what they say? That you are going to wed the gentle Hwi?”\n“It is true.”\nMalky chuckled, then grimaced with pain. “They did terrible damage to me, Leto,” he whispered, then: “Tell me, old worm...”\nMoneo gasped.\nMalky took a moment to recover from pain, then: “Tell me, old worm, is there a monster penis hidden in that monster body of yours? What a shock for the gentle Hwi!”\n“I told you the truth about that long ago,” Leto said.\n“Nobody tells the truth,” Malky husked.\n“You often told me the truth,” Leto said. “Even when you didn’t know it.”\n“That’s because you’re cleverer than the rest of us.”\n“Will you tell me about Hwi?”\n“I think you already know it.”\n“I want to hear it from you,” Leto said. “Did you get help from the Tleilaxu?”\n“They gave us knowledge, nothing more. Everything else we did for ourselves.”\n“I thought it was not the Tleilaxu’s doing.”\nMoneo could no longer", "o,” he whispered, then: “Tell me, old worm...”\nMoneo gasped.\nMalky took a moment to recover from pain, then: “Tell me, old worm, is there a monster penis hidden in that monster body of yours? What a shock for the gentle Hwi!”\n“I told you the truth about that long ago,” Leto said.\n“Nobody tells the truth,” Malky husked.\n“You often told me the truth,” Leto said. “Even when you didn’t know it.”\n“That’s because you’re cleverer than the rest of us.”\n“Will you tell me about Hwi?”\n“I think you already know it.”\n“I want to hear it from you,” Leto said. “Did you get help from the Tleilaxu?”\n“They gave us knowledge, nothing more. Everything else we did for ourselves.”\n“I thought it was not the Tleilaxu’s doing.”\nMoneo could no longer contain his curiosity. “Lord, what is this of Hwi and Tleilaxu? Why do you...”\n“Here there, old friend Moneo,” Malky said, rolling his gaze toward the majordomo. “Don’t you know what he...”\n“I was never your friend!” Moneo snapped.\n“Companion among the houris then,” Malky said.\n“Lord,” Moneo said, turning toward Leto, “why do you speak of...”\n“Shhh, Moneo,” Leto said. “We are tiring your old companion and | have things to learn from him yet.”\n“Did you ever wonder, Leto,” Malky asked, “why Moneo never tried to take the whole shebang away from you?”\n“The what?” Moneo demanded.\n“Another of Leto’s old words,” Malky said. “She and bang —shebang. It’s perfect. Why don’t you rename your Empire, Leto? The Grand Shebang!”\nLeto raised a hand to silence Moneo. “Will you tell me, Malky? About Hwi?”\n“Just a few tiny cells from my body,” Malky said. “Then the carefully nurtured growth and education—everything an exact opposite to your old friend Malky. We did it all in the no-room where you cannot see!”\n“But | notice when something vanishes,” Leto said.\n“No-room?” Moneo asked, then as the import of Malky’s words sank home: “You? You and Hwi.. .”\n“That is the shape | saw in the shadows,” Leto said.\nMoneo looked full at Leto’s face. “Lord, | will call off the wedding. | will say...”\n“You will do nothing of the kind!”\n“But Lord, if she and Malky are...”\n“Moneo,” Malky husked. “Your Lord commands and you must obey!”\nThat mocking tone! Moneo glared at Malky.\n“The exact opposite of Malky,” Leto said. “Didn’t you hear him?”\n“What could be better?” Malky asked.\n“But surely, Lord, if you now know...”\n“Moneo,” Leto said, “you are beginning to disturb me.”\nMoneo fell into abashed silence.\nLeto said: “That’s better. You know, Moneo, once tens of thousands of years ago when | was another person, | made a mistake.”\n“You, a mistake?” Malky mocked.\nLeto merely smiled. “My mistake was compounded by the beautiful way in which | expressed it.”\n“Tricks with words,” Malky taunted.\n“Indeed! This is what | said: ‘The present is distraction; the future a dream; only memory can unlock the meaning of life.’ Aren’t those beautiful words, Malky?”\n“Exquisite, old worm.”\nMoneo put a hand over his mouth.\n“But my words were a foolish lie,” Leto said. “I knew it at the time, but | was infatuated with the beautiful words. No— memory unlocks no meanings. Without anguish of the spirit, which is a wordless experience, there are no meanings anywhere.”\n“I fail to see the meaning of the anguish caused me by your bloody Fish Speakers,” Malky said.\n“You're suffering no anguish,” Leto said.\n“If you were in this body, you'd...”\n“That’s just physical pain,” Leto said. “It will end soon.”\n“Then when will | know the anguish?” Malky asked.\n“Perhaps later.”\nLeto flexed his front segments away from Malky to face Moneo. “Do you really serve the Golden Path, Moneo?”\n“Ahhh, the Golden Path,” Malky taunted.\n“You know | do, Lord,” Moneo said.\n“Then you must promise me,” Leto said, “that what you have learned here must never pass your lips. Not by word or\nSign can you reveal it.”\n“|I promise, Lord.”\n“He promises, Lord,” Malky sneered.\nOne of Leto’s tiny hands gestured at Malky, who lay staring up at the blunt profile of a face within its gray cowl. “For reasons of old admiration and .. . many other reasons, | cannot kill Malky. | cannot even ask it of you... yet he must be eliminated.”\n“Ohhh, how clever you are!” Malky said.\n“Lord, if you will wait at the other end of the chamber,” Moneo said. “Perhaps when you return Malky no longer will be a problem.”\n“He’s going to do it,” Malky husked. “Gods below! He’s going to do it.”\nLeto squirmed away and went to the shadowed limit of the chamber, keeping his attention on the faint arc of a line which would become an opening into the night if he merely converted the wish into a thought-of-command. What a long drop that would be out there—just roll off the landing-lip. He doubted that even his body would survive it. But there was no water in the sand beneath his tower and he could feel the Golden Path winking in and out of existence merely because he allowed himself to think of such an end.\n“Leto!” Malky called from behind him.\nLeto heard the litter grating on the wind-scattered sand which peppered the floor of his aerie.\nOnce more, Malky called: “Leto, you are the best! There’s no evil in this universe which can surpass...”\nA sodden thump shut off Malky’s voice. A blow to the throat, Leto thought. Yes, Moneo knows that one. There came the sound of the balcony’s transparent shield sliding open, the rasping of the litter on the rail, then silence.\nMoneo will have to bury the body in the sand, Leto thought. There is as yet no worm to come and devour the evidence. Leto turned then and looked across the chamber.\nMoneo stood leaning over the railing, peering down... down...down...\nI cannot pray for you, Malky, nor for you, Moneo, Leto thought. / may be the only religious consciousness in the Empire because I| am truly alone. . . so I cannot pray.\nYou cannot understand history unless you understand its flowings, its currents and the ways leaders move within such forces. A leader tries to perpetuate the conditions which demand his leadership. Thus, the leader requires the outsider. | caution you to examine my career with care. | am both leader and outsider. Do not make the mistake of assuming that I only created the Church which was the State. That was my function as leader and | had many historical models to use as pattern. For a clue to my role as outsider, look at the arts of my time. The arts are barbaric. The favorite poetry? The Epic. The popular dramatic ideal? Heroism. Dances? Wildly abandoned. From Moneo’s viewpoint, he is correct in describing this as dangerous. It stimulates the imagination. It makes people feel the lack of that which I have taken from them. What did | take from them? The right to participate in history.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\ndaho, stretched out on his cot with his eyes closed, heard\na weight drop onto the other cot. He sat up into the midafternoon light which slanted through the room’s single window at a sharp angle, reflecting off the white-tiled floor onto the light yellow walls. Siona, he saw, had come in and stretched herself on her cot. She already was reading one of the books she carried around with her in a green fabric pack.\nWhy books? he wondered.\nHe swung his feet to the floor and glanced around the room. How could this high-ceilinged, spacious box be considered even remotely Fremen? A wide table/desk of some dark brown local plastic separated the two cots. There were two doors. One led directly outside across a garden. The other admitted them to a luxurious bath whose pale blue tiles glistened under a broad skylight. The bath contained, among its many functional services, a sunken tub and a shower, each at least two meters square. The\ndoor to this sybaritic space remained open and Idaho could hear water running out of the tub. Siona appeared oddly fond of bathing in an excess of water.\nStilgar, Idaho’s Naib of the ancient days on Dune, would have looked on that room with scorn. “Shameful!” he would have said. “Decadent! Weak!” Stilgar would have used many scornful words about this entire village which dared to compare itself with a true Fremen sietch.\nPaper rustled as Siona turned a page. She lay with her head propped on two pillows, a thin white robe covering her body. The robe still revealed clinging wetness from her bath.\nIdaho shook his head. What was it on those pages which held her interest this way? She had been reading and re- reading since their arrival at Tuono. The volumes were thin but numerous, bearing only numbers on their black bindings. Idaho had seen a number nine.\nSwinging his feet to the floor, he stood and went to the window. There was an old man out there at a distance, digging in flowers. The garden was protected by buildings on three sides. The flowers bore large blossoms—red on the outside but, when they unfolded, white in the center. The old Man’s uncovered gray hair was a kind of blossom waving among the floral white and jeweled buds. Idaho smelled moldering leaves and freshly turned dirt against a background of pungent floral perfume.\nA Fremen tending flowers in the open!\nSiona volunteered nothing about her strange reading matter. She’s taunting me, Idaho thought. She wants me to ask.\nHe tried not to think about Hwi. Rage threatened to engulf him when he did. He remembered the Fremen word for that intense emotion: kanawa, the iron ring of jealousy. Where is Hwi? What is she doing at this moment?\nThe door from the garden opened without a knock and Teishar, an aide to Garun, entered. Teishar had a dead colored face full of dark wrinkles. His eyes were sunken with\npale yellow around the pupils. Teishar wore a brown robe. He had hair like old grass that had been left out to rot. He seemed unnecessarily ugly, like a dark and elemental spirit. Teishar closed the door and stood there looking at them.\nSiona’s voice came from behind Idaho. “Well, what is it?”\nIdaho noticed then that Teishar seemed strangely excited, vibrating with it.\n“The God Emperor...” Teishar cleared his throat and began again. “The God Emperor will come to Tuono!”\nSiona sat upright on the bed, folding her white robe over her knees. Idaho glanced back at her, then once more"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_681100b0769627a03ffcbe69fdced1c1313b7f7a843df7a7d02a3b3a9f54a483_v2"}
