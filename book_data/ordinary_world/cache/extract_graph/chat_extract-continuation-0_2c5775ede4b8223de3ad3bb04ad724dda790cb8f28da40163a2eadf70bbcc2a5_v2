�他在公社信用社贷了七百元款，并把少安将要来拉砖的事告诉了县高中他的表哥。少安装起贷款，拿了上次丢在根民办公窑的羊毛口袋，先跑到下山村用七十块钱买了一辆架子车，赶天黑才返回到双水村。第二天，他就坐公共汽车去了山西老丈人家。 \n　　到山西后，常有林从家里拿出四百元钱，引着少安到柳林镇用九百九十元钱买了一头三岁口的铁青骡子……从山西返回来的时候，少安就不用坐公共汽车了。他在骡子背上搭了一条线口袋，骑着这头牲畜往回走。这头骡子体魄雄壮，口青力大，毛色光亮如绸缎，一路上到处被人夸赞。快过黄河时，有人就出价一千一百元要买它。但再大价少安现在也不会卖。 \n　　第二天下午，少安骑着骡子来到了黄河大桥。 \n　　以前几次走山西往返都是坐汽车，经过大桥时，不能好好瞧瞧黄河，很急人。现在他迫不及待地从骡子背上跳下来，把牲口拴在一块石头上，就怀着一股难言的激动，走到大桥中间，伏在桥栏杆上。 \n　　他立刻感到一阵眩晕和心悸……眼前是一片麦芒似的黄色。毛翻翻浪头象无数拥挤在一起奔跑的野兽吼叫着从远方的峡谷中涌来，一直涌向他的胸前。两岸峭壁如刀削般直立。岩石黑青似铁，两边铁似的河岸后面，又是漫无边际的黄土山。这阵儿，西坠的落日又红又大又圆，把黄土山黄河水都涂上一片桔红。远处翻流的浪头间，突然一隐一现出现了一个跳跃的黑点，并朦胧地听见了一片撕恼裂胆的叫喊声。渐渐看清了，那是一只吃水很深的船。船飞箭一般从中水线上放下来，眨眼功夫就到了桥洞前。这是一只装石炭的小木船，好象随时都会倒扣进这沸腾的黄汤之中。船工们都光着身子，拼命地喊着，穿过了桥洞…… \n　　少安立刻调过身，看见那船刹那间就到了下游——下游水面开阔，船行走得似乎慢了下来。 \n　　这时候，他看见另一只上行的船正在河边象甲虫似的慢慢向大桥这里移动。牵着船的那根绳索象绷紧的弓弦似的向河岸的峭壁上扣在一串光身子纤夫的肩膀里。这些人几乎是在半崖羊肠小道上手脚并用爬着走；呻吟般的“嗯哟”声象来自大地深处……在这令人痛苦的呻吟中，那只下行的船已经漂到了一片平静的水面上；接着便传来了艄公那无拘无束的歌声——
