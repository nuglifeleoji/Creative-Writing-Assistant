A hallmark of the school is its **Imperial Conditioning**, a rigorous psychological and ethical training process that supposedly renders its graduates incapable of betrayal or harming others. This conditioning is so deeply ingrained that it is widely believed to make SUK doctors immune to subversion, ensuring unwavering loyalty to their patients.  \n\nDespite this reputation, **Dr. Yueh’s betrayal** stands as a shocking anomaly, as his actions contradict the school’s foundational principles. His compromise suggests that even Imperial Conditioning may have limits, though such breaches are exceedingly rare. The SUK SCHOOL’s doctors are highly sought after by the elite, not only for their medical expertise but also for their perceived incorruptibility, making their services expensive and exclusive.  \n\nThe school’s influence is further symbolized by **Yueh’s ring**, a marker of his SUK training and affiliation. While the institution prides itself on producing loyal, ethical physicians, Yueh’s case introduces a nuanced exception, hinting at the complexities beneath its otherwise impeccable reputation.
