\n　　哈呀，孙少安这小子公然不服从大队党支部的决定，简直无法无天了！ \n　　可是，在耕翻麦地前，田福堂眼睁睁地看着他所在的一队“乱”了…… \n　　那些天里，整个田家圪崂处在一种纷乱的激动之中，在田福堂的记忆里，这情景只有在土改和合作化时出现过。看吧，天一黑，人们把饭碗一撂，鞋底子掼得山响，就纷纷涌到一队的饲养室，吵嚷大半个夜晚。 \n　　一切很快被确定了下来。 \n　　正式分组的那晚上，副队长田福高终究是同族人，专意客气上门来把田福堂也请去了。福堂尽管一肚子不舒服，也只好一脸丧气去了饲养室。他不去不行，因为他自己也是一队的成员。 \n　　田福堂压抑不住痛苦，一开始就极没修养地和队长孙少安没头没脑混吵了一架，然后甩手走了。是的，他太痛苦了。当年搞合作化时，他曾怀着多么热烈的感情把这些左邻右舍拢合在一起；他做梦也想不到二十多年后的今天，大家又散伙了。随着集体的散伙，他的精神也七零八碎了！他无法接受眼前的现实。但他也没有能力拒挡这个潮流。 \n　　是的，尽管他拂袖而去，田家圪崂的生产责任组照样划分开了！ \n　　当然，一队也总不能把田福堂甩下不管，得让他加入到某个责任组去。 \n　　可责任组又是自愿结合，没有哪个组愿意要党支书！要田书记等于要一个负担——他常不是开会，就是“做工作”，一年四季劳动不了几天。 \n　　啊啊！以前人们谁敢想象，堂堂的田福堂，竟然能被冷落到如此地步！ \n　　谁也没有注意，那晚上田福堂的儿子润生也来参加会。他父亲甩手走后，这个瘦弱的青年没有走。他最后看没有人愿意要他爸，就把孙少安和田海民拉到一边，恳求说：“我们家能不能和海民哥一个组呢？你们不要计较我爸，他年纪大了，又是老脑筋。你们就把我看成是我们家的主事人。我爸气管有病，劳动可能不行。但我自己不教书了，准备到责任组劳动呀……” \n　　孙少安和田海民有点惊讶地听完润生的话。他们没注意到这个并不起眼的娃娃，已经成了一个大人——一茬又一茬的男人就是这样不知不觉地走上了严峻的生活舞台。 \n　　在这个诚恳的青年面前，两个已经成熟的庄稼人还有什么话可说呢？此刻，他们大概就能想起，当年的某个时候，他们就是这样有了成人的参与意识，庄严地面对着生活的�\n######################\nOutput:",
