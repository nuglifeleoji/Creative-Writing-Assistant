于禁为征南将军，加宠德为征西都先锋，大起七军，前往樊城。这七军，皆北方强壮之士。两员领军将校：一名董衡，一名董超；当日引各头目参拜于禁。董衡曰：“今将军提七枝重兵，去解樊城之厄，期在必胜，乃用庞德为先锋，岂不误事？”禁惊问其故。衡曰：“庞德原系马超手下副将，不得已而降魏；今其故主在蜀，职居五虎上将；况其亲兄庞柔亦在西川为官，今使他为先锋，是泼油救火也。将军何不启知魏王，别换一人去？”\n\n    禁闻此语，遂连夜入府启知曹操。操省悟，即唤庞德至阶下，令纳下先锋印。德大惊曰：“某正欲与大王出力，何故不肯见用？”操曰：“孤本无猜疑；但今马超现在西川，汝兄庞柔亦在西川，俱佐刘备。孤纵不疑，奈众口何？”庞德闻之，免冠顿首，流血满面而告曰：“某自汉中投降大王，每感厚恩，虽肝脑涂地，不能补报；大王何疑于德也？德昔在故乡时，与兄同居，嫂甚不贤，德乘醉杀之；兄恨德入骨髓，誓不相见，恩已断矣。故主马超，有勇无谋，兵败地亡，孤身入川，今与德各事其主，旧义已绝。德感大王恩遇，安敢萌异志？惟大王察之。”操乃扶起庞德，抚慰曰：“孤素知卿忠义，前言特以安众人之心耳。卿可努力建功。卿不负孤，孤亦必不负卿也。”德拜谢回家，令匠人造一木榇。次日，请诸友赴席，列榇于堂。众亲友见之，皆惊问曰：“将军出师，何用此不祥之物？”德举杯谓亲友曰：“吾受魏王厚恩，誓以死报。今去樊城与关某决战，我若不能杀彼，必为彼所杀；即不为彼所杀，我亦当自杀。故先备此榇，以示无空回之理。”众皆嗟叹。德唤其妻李氏与其子庞会出，谓其妻曰：“吾今为先锋，义当效死疆场。我若死，汝好生看养吾儿；吾儿有异相，长大必当与吾报仇也。”妻子痛哭送别，德令扶榇而行。临行，谓部将曰：“吾今去与关某死战，我若被关某所杀，汝等即取吾尸置此榇中；我若杀了关某，吾亦即取其首，置此榇内，回献魏王。”部将五百人皆曰：“将军如此忠勇，某等敢不竭力相助！”于是引军前进。有人将此言报知曹操。操喜曰：“庞德忠勇如此，孤何忧焉！”贾诩曰：“庞德恃血气之勇，欲与关某决死战\n######################\nOutput:",
