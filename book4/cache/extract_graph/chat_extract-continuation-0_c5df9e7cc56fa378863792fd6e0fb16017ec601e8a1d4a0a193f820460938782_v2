\n　　但是，灾难再一次从天而降。她的孩子刚满月，男人就死了。可怜的丈夫攒了一点钱，想重新整治一院地方，便雇了几个人先打几孔土窑洞，然后准备接石口。为了省几个钱，他在假日里亲自上手去帮工，结果被倒塌的土堆活活压死了。 \n　　苦命的人，常常是雪上加霜！红梅已经完全相信这是命运的惩罚。命运如此残酷无情，是不是在报应她曾偷过那几块手帕？或者是报应她爷爷在旧社会欺压过穷人？报应之烈焰啊，如果是这样，你什么时候才能在罪孽之人的头上熄灭？ \n　　丈夫死后，她完全变成了另外一个人。她不再奢望人世间的温暖和幸福。世界上的其它事对她来说不仅是遥远的，甚至是不存在的。她相信她生来就要吃一辈子苦，受一辈子罪。她活着的唯一寄托就是她怀里的这个小生命——她亲爱的儿子。她感谢老天爷动了恻隐之心，看见了她的不幸，给了她这样一个关照。 \n　　为了这孩子，她忍着悲痛重新开始了生活。她天天出山耕田种地；天冷天热，孩子都背在她的脊背上。她公公和丈夫的弟弟也穷家薄业，给她帮不上什么忙，她就一个人咬着牙苦熬日子…… \n　　这几天，沟口的川道上有庙会，她想着到庙会上去卖点茶饭，好给孩子置办点必需的东西。于是，在公公的帮助下，她就把一点简单的灶具搬运到那个戏场子里，卖起了饺子。她做梦也想不到，在这个地方碰见了过去班上的同学田润生…… \n　　郝红梅躺在黑暗中的土炕上，一边流泪，一边心酸地回首往事。她真后悔去沟口的庙会上卖饺子；要不，她就不会碰见田润生了。她不愿意再见过去那些同学的面。她希望悄无声息在异乡了却自己的一生；看见过去的熟人，她就会想起自己的往事——而往事是不堪回首的啊！ \n　　红梅又想，田润生是偶尔相遇，走了也就走了。润生现在是堂堂的汽车司机，她穷家薄业的，人家怎会把她这样的人放在眼里呢？再说，过去在学校里，她和润生也没什么交往。 \n　　可是出乎她预料的是，三天以后，田润生竟然又开着汽车，来到了家里。 \n　　郝红梅大吃一惊——简直不相信这是真的！ \n　　好心肠的润生给她拉了几千斤石炭，带了一塑料桶菜油，还给她的儿子买了许多吃食和一辆玩具小汽车。 \n　　红梅感动得不断用围裙揩眼泪。她\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>郝红梅<|>PERSON<|>郝红梅 is a woman who has faced significant hardships, including the
