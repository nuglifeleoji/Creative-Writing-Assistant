The village is situated at the confluence of the Dongla River and the Kuye River, which adds to its picturesque landscape. Shuangshui Village is particularly famous for its traditional yangge dance and a significant jujube forest, which serves as an emotional and cultural landmark for its residents.\n\nHistorically, the village was influenced by local leader Tian Futang, who played a prominent role in community affairs. However, the current atmosphere reflects a decline in public enthusiasm and community engagement, attributed to changes in leadership dynamics. Economic challenges are prevalent, with residents like Sun Shaoan operating businesses such as a brick kiln, while others struggle financially.

Characters like Sun Shaoping and Sun Shaoan have deep emotional ties to the village, representing their roots and past struggles. The community is depicted as one where individuals mobilize to address crises, such as reinforcing their dam to combat water shortages, and where discussions about agricultural practices and local governance are common.\n\nThe village is also a site of conflict, with tensions arising from internal disputes and external pressures, including violent confrontations with neighboring Wangjiazhuang. Residents navigate a complex social landscape where traditional values coexist with emerging capitalist tendencies, raising concerns among local authorities.

The river is located near Shuangshui Village (双水村), where it has become a focal point for various events that have captured the villagers' attention, including a major blasting event that has stirred excitement and anxiety among the residents.\n\nThe river is characterized by its soft whimpering sound beneath a broken ice surface, which adds to its poignant atmosphere. It is said to have been formed from the tears of a man who died in sorrow, a narrative that resonates with the local folklore, as well as from the tears of a lover mourning a transformed fairy. This emotional backdrop enhances the river's significance in the community, as it is not only a physical landmark but also a symbol of loss and memory.\n\nKuyin River serves as a crucial passage for various characters in their journeys. For instance, characters like 少平 walk along its banks on their way to 金波's house, while 金俊武 and 金俊山 cross it en route to a funeral, highlighting its role in both daily life and significant life events. The river also acts as a boundary that attackers must cross before reaching 田福堂's home, emphasizing its strategic importance in the narrative.\n\nAdditionally, the river is intertwined with the agricultural practices of the area, impacting local farming and the community's livelihood. It flows through the village, contributing to the somber atmosphere during funerals and other communal gatherings. The river's proximity to a school further underscores its role in the community, as it is a route for children and villagers alike.\n\nAs the community prepares for the dam construction, the river becomes a site of transformation, symbolizing both hope for a better future and the anxiety of change. The juxtaposition of celebratory events alongside the river, such as traditional singing gatherings, illustrates the dual nature of the river as a site of joy and sorrow.\n\nIn summary, Kuyin River is a multifaceted entity that embodies the emotional landscape of the local community, serving as a vital resource, a passage for significant journeys, and a symbol of both loss and hope.
