“嗷—\n\n    刹那间，刘锋只觉得大脑一片嗡鸣。哪怕是在蓝轩宇的金纹蓝银草的增幅之下，这一瞬他也还是眼前发黑，似乎连拔出白龙枪的动作都无法完成了。\n\n    黄金狮子吼！吕千寻的第一魂技！吕千寻的黄金狮王武魂本身极为强大，是真正的顶级武魂。虽然在血脉上没有龙、凤类武魂强大，但是，他这黄金狮王是狮类武魂中最强的一种。\n\n    这一声黄金狮子吼出现在狭长的甬道之中，覆盖的范围巨大。刘锋的精神力本来就不算太强，受到影响，顿时委顿。\n\n    另一边的钱磊则是双手抱头，痛苦地蹲了下去。他精神力虽然高，可这黄金狮子吼不仅有精神力冲击，还有强大的音波冲击，他哪里承受得住？\n\n    只是这一下，就让刘锋和钱磊在刹那间失去了战斗力。\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百零七章 龙吟\n\n    此时，叶灵瞳才看清，面前的对手，也就是先前隐藏在石堆后面的，竟然是蓝轩宇他们三人。\n\n    在黄金狮子吼的影响下，就连空中飞起的石块都有一部分被震成童粉。蓝轩宇身在正面，更是首当其冲。\n\n    他只觉得胸口一阵发闷，双耳嗡鸣，刹那间失去了听力，巨大的痛苦随之而来，仿佛整个人都要被这黄金狮子吼震散架了似的。事实上，吕千寻刚进入这迷宫的时候，心中就已经在暗暗窃喜了。毫无疑问，在这种环境下，他的黄金狮子吼能够发挥出最大的威力，甚至不畏群战。\n\n    但他这黄金狮子吼也有一个缺点，就是极其消耗魂力。所以，在先前那一场战斗之中，他并没有使用这一招。\n\n    刚才，对方一枪重创常剑逸，他才在情急之下用了出来。可此时看清对手竟然是这三个家伙，他心中已经后悔了。黄金狮子吼威力固然大，但同时也暴露了他们所在的位置，这并不是他愿意看到的。\n\n    而且，用在蓝轩宇三人身上，这本身就是浪费啊！他可不觉得这三个人能够对他们构成威胁。\n\n    叶灵瞳和常剑逸的额头上都有一个金色印记在隐隐发光，这是吕千寻之前施展在他们身上的，可以避免被黄金狮子吼影响。这一吼之下，战局已经基本确定。\n\n    吕千寻一步跨出，走向蓝轩宇，一拳就朝蓝轩宇头上砸去。虽然叶灵瞳不太想和蓝轩宇他们战斗，但她现在代表的是自己的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
