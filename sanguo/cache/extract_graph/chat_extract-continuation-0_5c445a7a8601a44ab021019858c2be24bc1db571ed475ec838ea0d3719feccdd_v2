以当此？”帝曰：“朕想卿西都救驾之功，未尝少忘，无可为赐。”因指所着袍带曰：“卿当衣朕此袍，系朕此带，常如在朕左右也。”承顿首谢。帝解袍带赐承，密语曰：“卿归可细观之，勿负朕意。”承会意，穿袍系带，辞帝下阁。\n\n    早有人报知曹操曰：“帝与董承登功臣阁说话。”操即入朝来看。董承出阁，才过宫门，恰遇操来；急无躲避处，只得立于路侧施礼。操问曰：“国舅何来？”承曰：“适蒙天子宣召，赐以锦袍玉带。”操问曰：“何故见赐？”承曰：“因念某旧日西都救驾之功，故有此赐。”操曰：“解带我看。”承心知衣带中必有密诏，恐操看破，迟延不解。操叱左右：“急解下来！”看了半晌，笑曰：“果然是条好玉带！再脱下锦袍来借看。”承心中畏惧，不敢不从，遂脱袍献上。操亲自以手提起，对日影中细细详看。看毕，自己穿在身上，系了玉带，回顾左右曰：“长短如何？”左右称美。操谓承曰：“国舅即以此袍带转赐与吾，何如？”承告曰：“君恩所赐，不敢转赠；容某别制奉献。”操曰：“国舅受此衣带，莫非其中有谋乎？”承惊曰：“某焉敢？丞相如要，便当留下。”操曰：“公受君赐，吾何相夺？聊为戏耳。”遂脱袍带还承。\n\n    承辞操归家，至夜独坐书院中，将袍仔细反复看了，并无一物。承思曰：“天子赐我袍带，命我细观，必非无意；今不见甚踪迹，何也？”随又取玉带检看，乃白玉玲珑，碾成小龙穿花，背用紫锦为衬，缝缀端整，亦并无一物，承心疑，放于桌上，反复寻之。良久，倦甚。正欲伏几而寝，忽然灯花落于带上，烧着背衬。承惊拭之，已烧破一处，微露素绢，隐见血迹。急取刀拆开视之，乃天子手书血字密诏也。诏曰：“朕闻人伦之大，父子为先；尊卑之殊，君臣为重。近日操贼弄权，欺压君父；结连党伍，败坏朝纲；敕赏封罚，不由朕主。朕夙夜忧思，恐天下将危。卿乃国之大臣，朕之至戚，当念高帝创业之艰难，纠合忠义两全之烈士，殄灭奸党，复安社稷，祖宗幸甚！破指洒血，书诏付卿，再四慎之，勿负朕意！建安四年春三月诏。”\n\n
