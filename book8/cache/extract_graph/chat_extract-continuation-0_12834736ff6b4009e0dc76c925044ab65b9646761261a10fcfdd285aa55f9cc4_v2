凡笑得很阴险，但丝毫没有因为蓝轩宇的反应而不满，他掰了掰手指头，“当年老夫第一次体验星际战机的时候，好像是坚持了十八分钟，他坚持了十九分钟。\n\n    我那会儿十二岁，他才八岁吧，需子可教也。\n\n    哈哈哈哈，捡到宝了。不错、不错，精神力、体质俱佳，还具备几分老夫当年的智谋，实乃可造之材。”\n\n    蓝轩宇真的是吐了个天昏地暗。\n\n    这第一次乘坐星际战机的体验着实不怎么美好，除了一开始沉浸在宇宙之中的感觉不错之外，其他的都是一团槽。尤其是进入陨石带之后，他简直就要疯了。\n\n    脸色苍白的蓝轩宇扶着墙走出卫生间，一脸呆滞。\n\n    “老师，我……”\n\n    银天凡微微一笑：“没事、没事，回去好好休息吧。明天晚上你放学之后再来我这儿，我会跟牧重天说的。”\n\n    “哦、哦。”\n\n    蓝轩宇都不知道自己是怎么回宿舍的，他一回到宿舍就瘫软在了床上，甚至连晚饭都没吃。吃不下去啊！那恶心感几乎充斥在他的每一个细胞之中，整个人也像是散了架似的。\n\n    就连钱磊和刘锋的问候他都没太听清楚，就沉沉地进入了睡梦之中。可哪怕是在睡梦里，他似乎也一直在旋转，实在是太难受了。\n\n    第二天清晨。叶灵瞳昨晚没睡太好。\n\n    综合评分，他们组最终只拿了第四名。毫无疑问，这个成绩对于吕千寻和叶灵瞳的打击都是相当大的，尤其是对于好胜的叶灵瞳。\n\n    在昨天的考核中，蓝轩宇那突如其来的一声龙吟瞬间让她失去了战斗力。然后她就被刘锋一枪刺穿，这着实给她留下了极大的心理阴影。\n\n    她实在是不明白，为什么自己的武魂在蓝轩宇面前总是会出现这样那样的问题。而这是她最不愿意面对的。\n\n    连吕千寻也打不过那家伙吗?吕千寻可是马上快达到二十级了啊！无疑，昨天获得冠军，让蓝轩宇小组成了众矢之的。\n\n    快到食堂了，叶灵瞳突然听到食堂里乱糟糟的，推门而入，她顿时吓了一跳。\n\n    十几个人围在那里，不知道在干什么。\n\n    “蓝轩宇，你必须给我们一个交代，有你这样的吗?”\n\n    “就是，你把早饭都给吃了，大家怎么办?”\n\n    “蓝轩宇，你是不是故意的，用储物魂导器把早饭都给藏起来了?你一个人能吃得了那么多?”\n\n    什么情况？\n\n    叶灵瞳有些发蒙，赶忙走上前去。然后她就看到，平时盛放早饭的餐盘中空空如也，一干二净。\n\n    蓝轩宇此时被人�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
