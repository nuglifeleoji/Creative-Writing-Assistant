Clever, clever. And I accept it as he knew I would.\nYou cannot manipulate a marionette with only one string.\n—THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\nhe Reverend Mother Sheeana stood at her sculpting\nstand, a gray-clawed shaper covering each hand like exotic gloves. The black sensiplaz on the stand had been taking form under her hands for almost an hour. She felt herself close to the creation that sought realization, surging from a wild place within her. The intensity of the creative force made her skin tremble and she wondered that passersby in the hall to her right did not sense it. The north window of her workroom admitted gray light behind her and the western window glowed orange with a desert sunset.\nPrester, Sheeana’s senior assistant here at the Desert Watch Station, had paused in the doorway a few minutes ago but the entire station complement knew better than to interrupt Sheeana at this work.\nStepping back, Sheeana brushed a strand of sun-streaked brown hair from her forehead with the back of a hand. The black plaz stood in front of her like a challenge, its curves and planes a/most fitted to the form she sensed within her.\nI come here to create when my fears are greatest, she thought.\nThis thought dampened the creative surge and she redoubled her efforts to complete the sculpture. Her shaper- clad hands dipped and swooped over the plaz and black Shape followed each intrusion like a wave driven by an insane wind.\nThe light from the north window faded and the automatics compensated with a yellow-gray glow from the\nceiling edges but it was not the same. It was not the same!\nSheeana stepped back from her work. Close ... but not close enough. She could almost touch the form within her and feel it striving for birth. But the plaz was not right. One sweeping stroke of her right hand reduced it to a black blob on the stand.\nDamn!\nShe stripped off the shapers and dropped them to the shelf beside the sculpting stand. The horizon out the western window still carried a strip of orange. Fading fast the way she felt the fading of her creative surge.\nStriding to the sunset window, she was in time to see the last of the day’s search teams return. Their landing lights were firefly darts off to the south where a temporary flat had been established in the path of the advancing dunes. She could see from the slow way the ‘thopters came down that they had found no spiceblows or other signs that Sandworms were at last developing from the sandtrout planted here.\nl am shepherd to worms that may never come.\nThe window gave back to her a dark reflection of her features. She could see where the Spice Agony had left its marks. The slender, brown-skinned waif of Dune had become a tall, rather austere woman. But her brown hair still insisted on escaping the tight coif at the nape of her neck. And she could see the wildness in her all-blue eyes. Others could see it, too. And that was the problem, source of some of her fears.\nThere appeared to be no stopping the Missionaria in its preparations for our Sheeana.\nIf the giant sandworms developed—Shai-hulud returned! And the Missionaria Protectiva of the Bene Gesserit was ready to launch her onto an unsuspecting humanity prepared for religious adoration. The myth become real... just the way she tried to make that sculpture back there a reality.\nHoly Sheeana! The God Emperor is her thrall! See how the sacred sandworms obey her! Leto is returned!\nWould it influence the Honored Matres? Probably. They gave at least lip service to the God Emperor in his name of Guldur.\nNot likely they would follow “Holy Sheeana’s” lead except in the matter of sexual exploits. Sheeana knew her own sexual behavior, outrageous even by Bene Gesserit standards, was a form of protest against this role the Missionaria tried to impose on her. The excuse that she only polished the males trained in sexual bondage by Duncan Idaho was just that... an excuse.\nBellonda suspects.\nMentat Bell was a constant danger to Sisters who got out of line. And that was a major reason Bell held her powerful position in the high Council of the Sisterhood.\nSheeana turned away from the window and flung herself onto the orange and umber spread covering her cot. Directly in front of her, a large black and white drawing of a giant worm poised above a tiny human figure.\nThat’s the way they were and may never be again. What was | trying to say with that drawing? If | knew I might be able to complete the plaz sculpture.\nIt had been perilous to develop a secret hand-talk with Duncan. But there were things the Sisterhood could not know—not yet.\nThere might be a way of escape for both of us.\nBut where could they go? It was a universe beset by Honored Matres and other forces. It was a universe of scattered planets peopled mostly by humans who wanted only to live out their lives in peace—accepting Bene Gesserit guidance in some places, squirming under Honored Matre Suppression in many regions, mostly hoping to govern themselves as best they could, the perennial dream of democracy, and then there were always the unknowns. And always the lesson of the Honored Matres! Murbella’s clues\nsaid Fish Speakers and Reverend Mothers in extremis formed the Honored Matres. Fish Speaker democracy become Honored Matre autocracy! The clues were too numerous to ignore. But why had they emphasized unconscious compulsions with their T-probes, cellular induction, and sexual prowess?\nWhere is the market to accept our fugitive talents?\nThis universe no longer possessed a single bourse. A species of subterranean webworks could be defined. It was extremely loose, based on old compromises and temporary agreements.\nOdrade had once said: “It resembles an old garment with frayed edges and patched holes.”\nCHOAM'’s tightly bound trading network of the Old Empire was no more. Now, it was fearful bits and pieces held together by the loosest of ties. People treated this patched thing with contempt, longing always for the good old days.\nWhat kind of a universe would accept us merely as fugitives and not as the Sacred Sheeana with her consort?\nNot that Duncan was a consort. That had been the Bene Gesserit’s original plan: “Bond Sheeana to Duncan. We control him and he can control her.”\nMurbella cut that plan short. And a good thing for both of us. Who needs a sexual obsession? But Sheeana was forced to admit she harbored oddly confused feelings about Duncan Idaho. The hand-talks, the touching. And what could they say to Odrade when she came prying? Not if, but when.\n“We talk about ways for Duncan and Murbella to escape you, Mother Superior. We talk about other ways to restore Teg’s memories. We talk about our own private rebellion against the Bene Gesserit. Yes, Darwi Odrade! Your former student has become a rebel against you.”\nSheeana admitted to mixed feelings about Murbella as well.\nShe domesticated Duncan where | might have failed.\nThe captive Honored Matre was a fascinating study... and amusing at times. There was her joking doggerel posted on the wall of the ship’s Acolyte dining room.\nHey, God! | hope you're there.\n| want you to hear my prayer. That graven image on my shelf; Is it really you or just myself? Well, anyway, here it goes: Please keep me on my toes. Help me past my worst mistakes, Doing it for both our sakes,\nFor an example of perfection\nTo the Proctors of my section;\nOr merely for the Heaven of it, Like bread, for the leaven of it. For whatever reason may incline, Please act for yours and mine.\nThe subsequent confrontation with Odrade, caught by the comeyes, had been a beautiful thing to watch. Odrade’s voice oddly strident: “Murbella? You?”\n“I’m afraid so.” No contrition in her at all.\n“Afraid so?” Still strident.\n“Why not?” Quite defiant.\n“You joke about the Missionaria! Don’t protest. That was your intent.”\n“They’re so damned pretentious!”\nSheeana could only sympathize as she reflected on that confrontation. Rebellious Murbella was a symptom. What ferments until you are forced to notice it?\n| fought in just that way against the everlasting discipline, “which will make you strong, child.”\nWhat was Murbella like as a child? What pressures shaped her? Life was always a reaction to pressures. Some gave in to easy distractions and were shaped by them: pores bloated and reddened by excesses. Bacchus leering at them. Lust fixing its shape on their features. A Reverend Mother knew it by millennial observation. We are shaped by\npressures whether we resist them or not. Pressures and shapings—that was life. And I create new pressures by my secret defiance.\nGiven the Sisterhood’s present state of alertness to all threats, the hand-talk with Duncan probably was futile.\nSheeana tipped her head and looked at the black blob on the sculpting stand.\nBut I will persist. | will create my own statement of my life. | will create my own life! Damn the Bene Gesserit!\nAnd I will lose the respect of my Sisters.\nThere was something antique about the way respectful conformity was forced upon them. They had preserved this thing from their most ancient past, taking it out regularly to polish and make the necessary repairs that time required of all human creations. And here it was today, held in unspoken reverence.\nThus you are a Reverend Mother and by no other Judgment shall that be true.\nSheeana knew then she would be forced to test that antique thing to its limits, probably breaking it. And that black plaz form seeking outlet from the wild place within her was only one element of what she knew she had to do. Call it rebellion, call it by any other name, the force she felt in her breast could not be denied.\nConfine yourself to observing and you always miss the point of your own life. The object can be stated this way: Live the best life you can. Life is a game whose rules you learn if you leap into it and play it to the hilt. Otherwise, you are caught off balance, continually surprised by the shifting play. Non-players often whine and complain that luck always passes them by. They refuse to see that they can create some of their own luck.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nfd H ave you studied the latest comeye record of Idaho?” Bellonda asked.\n“Later! Later!” Odrade knew she was feeling peckish and it had come out in the response to Bell’s pertinent question. Pressures confined the Mother Superior more and more these days. She had always tried to face her duties with an\nattitude of broad interest. The more things to interest her, the wider her scan and that was sure to bring more usable data. Using the senses improved them. Substance, that was what her questing interests desired. Substance. It was like hunting for food to assuage a deep hunger.\nBut her days were becoming duplicates of this morning. Her liking for personal inspections was well known but these workroom walls held her. She must be where she could be reached. Not only reached, but able to dispatch communications and people on the instant.\nDamn! I will make the time. | must!\nIt was time pressure as much as anything.\nSheeana said: “We trundle along on borrowed days.”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0faaf1822fdbeba5dee2e53dc79449e2f5a866e7aa60bd1741e910865be0348a_v2"}
