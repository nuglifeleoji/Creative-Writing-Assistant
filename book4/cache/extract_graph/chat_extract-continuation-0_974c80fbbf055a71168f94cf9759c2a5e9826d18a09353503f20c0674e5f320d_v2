\n　　金俊山正准备点烟，听孙玉亭这么一说，也就不好意思再吸了。 \n　　田福堂无所谓地说：“不怕！你们吸你们的……玉亭，你干脆把海民叫来，咱临时开个支部会，好好商量一下俊斌的事！” \n　　孙玉亭马上出门找支委田海民去了。 \n　　玉亭找来田海民以后，大队党支部的五个成员就都聚齐了。 \n　　田福堂坐在炕上的被窝里，对坐在脚地上的四个人说：“俊斌同志为革命光荣地献出了自己的生命，我们大家都很悲痛。我们开个支部会，研究一下如何为俊斌同志办丧事，捎带着也考虑一下他的家属待遇问题……俊武，你是俊斌的亲属，你先提个看法。另外还有什么要求，你也说出来，咱们尽量让你们满意。” \n　　金俊武先没言传。过了一会他才对身边的金俊山说：“俊山哥你先说吧。” \n　　金俊山看出金俊武不好开口，就用他自己的口气，把俊武他哥的那些意思都端了出来——就好象这是他自己的意见。 \n　　田福堂立刻表态说：“这没问题！彩娥今后就按干部家属对待，粮钱由队里给出。至于我金大婶，她的一部分口粮大队也可以包给。另外，我们还要把俊斌当烈士对待哩！要立个墓碑，让子孙后代知道他的功劳。安葬前，咱们再开个隆重的追悼会！”田福堂把刚才孙玉亭的建议原封不动搬出来，就象这都是他自己考虑过的意见。 \n　　孙玉亭马上又激动地发言说：“我还有个建议，干脆！咱们再追认金俊斌同志为中共党员！” \n　　大家对这建议有点瞠目。年轻的组织委员田海民婉言说：“玉亭叔的心情是好的。但俊斌哥生前也没写过入党申请书。 \n　　再说，入党的事最后还要公社批准哩，这恐怕……”金俊武立刻理智地说：“这不能！再说，俊斌是个农民，人又殁了，也没留下个后代，党员不党员也没什么意思……现在这样对待就行了。我倒没什么，可灾难发生了，队里处理好一点，我也好给家里人做工作。要是处理不好，家里的人寻队里的麻烦，我也没办法……现在这样处理我满意了，估计家里人也再不会怎样。唉，说来说去，我们自家的人也有责任……” \n　　大家看金俊武这个态度，都松了一口气。田福堂心里对金俊武说：我知道不这样，你金俊武不会饶我田福堂！但他嘴里说：“俊武的话我听了很感动。不愧是共产党员嘛！识大体，顾大局……”由于声音太高，他猛烈地咳嗽起来。等咳嗽停息下来，他喘着气说：“我�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
