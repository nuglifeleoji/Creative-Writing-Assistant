呢？只有你和你妈是我最亲的亲人我不爱你别的。就爱你的好心肠。你就答应我吧！咱俩死死活活就在一起生活吧！我不会给你做针线，但我能吃下苦！我情愿跟你受苦受罪一辈子……” \n　　院子里的冯国斌听到这些话，受到极大的震动。他猛然感到，以前并不了解这个女孩子！想起以前曾那么粗暴地对待她，星光下，羞愧地垂下了毛碴碴的脑袋。 \n　　房子里的谈话又开始了。他克制住乱纷纷的心情，继续听下去。 \n　　运生的声音： \n　　“小吴！你一片好心我都领了。可是我不能这样嘛！我是个土包子老百姓，只念过三天两后晌的书。我的开展就在这土疙瘩林里呢！你是个知识人，你应该做更大的事，你不应该一辈子屈在咱南马河的乡山圪劳里！国家总有一天会叫你去办更适合你干的事！你要是和我结了婚，也就等于我把你害了。现在全公社都在传你和我的谣言，我和我妈急得哭了几回鼻子。前几天我们母子俩商量了一下，托我大舅在他们村给我介绍了个媳妇，昨天女方已经来了我家，我们已经订了婚了。我们还备办了一点酒菜。准备明天请公社和村里的一些人吃喝一下，把这事明了，也就等于堵那些造谣人的嘴。 \n　　你受气已经受得太多了，怎能因为我再叫你受气哩！” \n　　接下来，就听到吴月琴像孩子般没有任何节制地呜咽…… \n　　冯国斌浑身的血直往头上涌来。他猛然感到一阵眩晕。他跌跌撞撞地来到院当中一棵老槐树下，把那黑苍苍的脸靠在冰凉粗糙的权杆上。两颗如此年轻而纯真的心，感动得全鼻根一阵又一阵发酸。 \n　　屋里，吴月琴的哭声停止了。她呢呢喃喃地说：“运生，你真好。你太好了，运生！我要像亲哥哥一样看待你；你妈就是我的亲妈妈，我就是她的亲闺女，也是你的亲妹妹……亲的……” \n　　这时候，运生却哭开了。小伙子的哭声尽管有节制，但听得出那粗壮的男音一声声都是从肺腑里涌出来的。冯国斌急骤地迈动着粗而短的双腿，走出小学校的院子。他脸上的肌肉绷得紧紧的，那道伤疤也变成紫红色。他的神态就像护犊的老牛那般愤怒。他觉得社会上有一些坏蛋在坑害这些娃娃！如果现在一伸手就能抓住这些坏蛋的话，他马上就会用那握过老镢头的手，把他们的脖子卡断！同时也想到，在这些娃娃受磨难的时候，他却没有帮扶地们一把，心像刀扎一般难受！
