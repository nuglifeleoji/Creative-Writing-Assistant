苞脑袋便砍。忽一道红光闪处，李异头早落地，原来关兴见张苞马回，正待接应，忽见张苞马倒，李异赶来，兴大喝一声，劈李异于马下，救了张苞。乘势掩杀，孙桓大败。各自鸣金收军。\n\n    次日，孙桓又引军来。张苞、关兴齐出。关兴立马于阵前，单搦孙桓交锋。桓大怒，拍马轮刀，与关兴战三十余合，气力不加，大败回阵。二小将追杀入营，吴班引着张南、冯习驱兵掩杀。张苞奋勇当先，杀入吴军，正遇谢旌，被苞一矛刺死。吴军四散奔走。蜀将得胜收兵，只不见了关兴。张苞大惊曰：“安国有失，吾不独生！”言讫，绰枪上马。寻不数里，只见关兴左手提刀，右手活挟一将。苞问曰：“此是何人？”兴笑答曰：“吾在乱军中，正遇仇人，故生擒来。”苞视之，乃昨日放冷箭的谭雄也。苞大喜，同回本营，斩首沥血，祭了死马。遂写表差人赴先主处报捷。\n\n    孙桓折了李异、谢旌、谭雄等许多将士，力穷势孤，不能抵敌，即差人回吴求救。蜀将张南、冯习谓吴班曰：“目今吴兵势败，正好乘虚劫寨。”班曰：“孙桓虽然折了许多将士，朱然水军现今结营江上，未曾损折。今日若去劫寨，倘水军上岸，断我归路，如之奈何？”南曰：“此事至易：可教关、张二将军，各引五千军伏于山谷中；如朱然来救，左右两军齐出夹攻，必然取胜。”班曰：“不如先使小卒诈作降兵，却将劫寨事告与朱然；然见火起，必来救应，却令伏兵击之，则大事济矣。”冯习等大喜，遂依计而行。\n\n    却说朱然听知孙桓损兵折将，正欲来救，忽伏路军引几个小卒上船投降。然问之，小卒曰：“我等是冯习帐下士卒，因赏罚不明，待来投降，就报机密。”然曰：“所报何事？”小卒曰：“今晚冯习乘虚要劫孙将军营寨，约定举火为号。”朱然听毕，即使人报知孙桓。报事人行至半途，被关兴杀了。朱然一面商议，欲引兵去救应孙桓。部将崔禹曰：“小卒之言，未可深信。倘有疏虞，水陆二军尽皆休矣。将军只宜稳守水寨，某愿替将军一行。”然从之，遂令崔禹引一万军前去。是夜，冯习、张南、吴班分兵三路，直杀入孙桓寨中，四面火起，吴兵大乱，寻路奔走。\n\n
