Shai-Hulud is deeply intertwined with Fremen spirituality and survival, as the sandworms are both feared and worshipped for their immense power and their connection to the production of the spice melange, a substance of immense economic and strategic importance. The giant sandworms dominate the harsh deserts of Arrakis, embodying the planet's unforgiving yet life-sustaining nature.
