You will learn every muscle in your body. You will know these muscles the way you know your hands.”\nHe swallowed hard at the magnitude of this prospect. Then: “What are you doing to me? What is your plan for me?”\n“I intend to turn you loose upon the universe,” she said. “You will become whatever it is you most deeply desire.”\nHe mulled this for a moment. “Whatever | desire?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s impossible!”\n“Unless you learn to control your desires the way you control your reality,” she said. And she thought: There! Let his analysts examine that. They'll advise cautious approval, but Farad’n will move a step closer to realization of what I’m really doing.\nHe proved his surmise by saying: “It’s one thing to tell a person he'll realize his heart’s desire. It’s another thing to\nactually deliver that realization.”\n“You've come farther than | thought,” Jessica said. “Very good. | promise you: if you complete this program of learning, you'll be your own man. Whatever you do, it'll be because that’s what you want to do.”\nAnd let a Truthsayer try to pry that apart, she thought.\nHe stood up, but the expression he bent upon her was warm, a sense of camaraderie in it. “You know, | believe you. Damned if | Know why, but | do. And | won’t say a word about the other things I’m thinking.”\nJessica watched his retreating back as he let himself out of her bedchamber. She turned off the glowglobes, lay back. This Farad’n was a deep one. He’d as much as told her that he was beginning to see her design, but he was joining her conspiracy of his own volition.\nWait until he begins to learn his own emotions, she thought. With that, she composed herself for the return to sleep. The morrow, she knew, would be plagued by casual encounters with palace personnel asking seemingly innocuous questions.\nHumankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs, thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence. In this periodic race, any pause becomes luxury. Only then can one reflect that all is permitted; all is possible.\n—THE APOCRYPHA OF MUAD’DIB\nT touch of sand is important, Leto told himself.\nHe could feel the grit beneath him where he sat beneath a brilliant sky. They had force-fed him another heavy dosage of melange, and Leto’s mind turned upon itself like a whirlpool. An unanswered question lay deep within the funnel of the whirlpool: Why do they insist that I say it? Gurney was stubborn: no doubt of that. And he’d had his orders from his Lady Jessica.\nThey’d brought him out of the sietch into the daylight for this “lesson.” He had the strange sensation that he’d let his body take the short trip from the sietch while his inner being mediated a battle between the Duke Leto | and the old Baron Harkonnen. They’d fought within him, through him, because he would not let them communicate directly. The fight had taught him what had happened to Alia. Poor Alia.\n| was right to fear the spice trip, he thought.\nA welling bitterness toward the Lady Jessica filled him. Her damned gom jabbar! Fight it and win, or die in the attempt. She couldn’t put a poisoned needle against his neck, but she could send him into the valley of peril which had claimed her own daughter.\nSnuffling sounds intruded upon his awareness. They wavered, growing louder, then softer, louder . . . softer. There was no way for him to determine whether they had current reality or came from the spice.\nLeto’s body sagged over his folded arms. He felt hot sand through his buttocks. There was a rug directly in front of him, but he sat on open sand. A shadow lay across the rug: Namri. Leto stared into the muddy pattern of the rug, feeling bubbles ripple there. His awareness drifted on its own current through a landscape which stretched out to a horizon of shock-headed greenery.\nHis skull thrummed with drums. He felt heat, fever. The fever was a pressure of burning which filled his senses, crowding out awareness of flesh until he could only feel the moving shadows of his peril. Namri and the knife. Pressure... pressure... Leto lay at last suspended between sky and sand, his mind lost to all but the fever. Now he waited for something to happen, sensing that any occurrence would be a first-and-only thing.\nHot-hot pounding sunshine crashed brilliantly around him, without tranquillity, without remedy. Where is my Golden Path? Everywhere bugs crawled. Everywhere. My skin is not my own. He sent messages along his nerves, waited out the dragging other-person responses.\nUp head, he told his nerves.\nA head which might have been his own crept upward, looked out at patches of blankness in the bright light.\nSomeone whispered: “He’s deep into it now.”\nNo answer.\nBurn fire sun building heat on heat.\nSlowly, outbending, the current of his awareness took him drifting through a last screen of green blankness and there, across low folding dunes, distant no more than a kilometer beyond the stretched out chalk line of a cliff, there lay the green burgeoning future, upflung, flowing into endless green, greenswelling, green-green moving outward endlessly.\nIn all of that green there was not one great worm.\nRiches of wild growth, but nowhere Shai-Hulud.\nLeto sensed that he had ventured across old boundaries into a new land which only the imagination had witnessed, and that he looked now directly through the very next veil which a yawning humankind called Unknown.\nIt was bloodthirsty reality.\nHe felt the red fruit of his life swaying on a limb, fluid Slipping away from him, and the fluid was the spice essence flowing through his veins.\nWithout Shai-Hulud, no more spice.\nHe had seen a future without the great grey worm- serpent of Dune. He knew this, yet could not tear himself from the trance to rail against such a passage.\nAbruptly his awareness plunged back—back, back, away from such a deadly future. His thoughts went into his bowels, becoming primitive, moved only by intense emotions. He found himself unable to focus on any particular aspect of his vision or his surroundings, but there was a voice within him. It spoke an ancient language and he understood it perfectly. The voice was musical and lilting, but its words bludgeoned him.\n“It is not the present which influences the future, thou fool, but the future which forms the present. You have it all backward. Since the future is set, an unfolding of events which will assure that future is fixed and inevitable.”\nThe words transfixed him. He felt terror rooted in the heavy matter of his body. By this he knew his body still existed, but the reckless nature and enormous power of his vision left him feeling contaminated, defenseless, unable to signal a muscle and gain its obedience. He knew he was Submitting more and more to the onslaught of those collective lives whose memories once had made him believe he was real. Fear filled him. He thought that he might be losing the inner command, falling at last into Abomination.\nLeto felt his body twisting in terror.\nHe had come to depend upon his victory and the newly won benevolent cooperation of those memories. They had\nturned against him, all of them—even royal Harum whom he’d trusted. He lay shimmering on a surface which had no roots, unable to give any expression to his own life. He tried to concentrate upon a mental picture of himself, was confronted by overlapping frames, each a different age: infant into doddering ancient. He recalled his father’s early training: Let the hands grow young, then old. But his whole body was immersed now in this lost reality and the entire image progression melted into other faces, the features of those who had given him their memories.\nA diamond thunderbolt shattered him.\nLeto felt pieces of his awareness drifting apart, yet he retained a sense of himself somewhere between being and nonbeing. Hope quickening, he felt his body breathing. In... Out. He took in a deep breath: yin. He let it out: yang.\nSomewhere just beyond his grasp lay a place of supreme independence, a victory over all of the confusions inherent in his multitude of lives—no false sense of command, but a true victory. He knew his previous mistake now: he had sought power in the reality of his trance, choosing that rather than face the fears which he and Ghanima had fed in each other.\nFear defeated Alia!\nBut the seeking after power spread another trap, diverting him into fantasy. He saw the illusion. The entire illusion process rotated half a turn and now he knew a center from which he could watch without purpose the flight of his visions, of his inner lives.\nElation flooded him. It made him want to laugh, but he denied himself this luxury, knowing it would bar the doors of memory.\nAhhhh, my memories, he thought. / have seen your illusion. You no longer invent the next moment for me. You merely show me how to create new moments. l'Il not lock myself on the old tracks.\nThis thought passed through his awareness as though wiping a surface clean and in its wake he felt his entire body, an e/nfa//e which reported in most minute detail on every cell, every nerve. He entered a state of intense quiet. In this quiet, he heard voices, knowing they came from a great distance, but he heard them clearly as though they echoed in a chasm.\nOne of the voices was Halleck’s. “Perhaps we gave him too much of it.”\nNamri answered. “We gave him exactly what she told us to give him.”\n“Perhaps we should go back out there and have another look at him.” Halleck.\n“Sabiha is good at such things; she'll call us if anything starts to go wrong.” Namri.\n“| don’t like this business of Sabiha.” Halleck.\n“She’s a necessary ingredient.” Namri.\nLeto felt bright light outside himself and darkness within, but the darkness was secretive, protective, and warm. The light began to blaze up and he felt that it came from the darkness within, swirling outward like a brilliant cloud. His body became transparent, drawing him upward, yet he retained that e/nfa//e contact with every cell and nerve. The multitude of inner lives fell into alignment, nothing tangled or mixed. They became very quiet in duplication of his own inner silence, each memory-life discrete, an entity incorporeal and undivided.\nLeto spoke to them then: “I am your spirit. | am the only life you can realize. | am the house of your spirit in the land which is nowhere, the land which is your only remaining home. Without me, the intelligible universe reverts to chaos. Creative and abysmal are inextricably linked in me; only | can mediate between them. Without me, mankind will sink into the mire and vanity of Knowing. Through me, you and they will find the only way out of chaos: understanding by living.”\nWith this he let go of himself and became himself, his own person compassing the entirety of his past. It was not victory, not defeat, but a new thing to be shared with any inner life he chose. Leto savored this newness, letting it possess every cell, every nerve, giving up what the e/nfalle had presented to him and recovering the totality in the same instant.\nAfter a time, he awoke in white darkness. With a flash of awareness he knew where his flesh was: seated on sand about a kilometer from the cliff wall\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a Bene Gesserit who is training Farad'n and has a deep understanding of human nature and control over desires and reality.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARAD’N<|>PERSON<|>Farad'n is a deep and complex individual who is being trained by Jessica to realize his heart's desires and gain control over his emotions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is undergoing a spice-induced trance, experiencing visions of the future and battling inner conflicts, including memories of his ancestors.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>PERSON<|>Gurney Halleck is a loyal follower of Jessica, involved in administering the spice trance to Leto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMRI<|>PERSON<|>Namri is a figure involved in the spice trance process, following Jessica's instructions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SABIHA<|>PERSON<|>Sabiha is a person involved in monitoring Leto during his spice trance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is Leto's sister who fell into Abomination due to fear and inner conflicts.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is Leto's twin sister, mentioned in the context of shared fears and memories.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>PERSON<|>Duke Leto is one of the ancestral memories within Leto, representing a past life.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>PERSON<|>Baron Harkonnen is another ancestral memory within Leto, representing a dark past.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>GEO<|>Shai-Hulud is the great sandworm of Dune, whose absence in Leto's vision signifies a future without spice.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune is the desert planet central to the events and visions described.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH<|>GEO<|>Sietch is a Fremen community where Leto was brought before his spice trance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE TRANCE<|>EVENT<|>A hallucinogenic state induced by melange, revealing visions of the future and inner conflicts.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is Leto's envisioned future, a way to save humanity from chaos.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>FARAD’N<|>Jessica is training Farad'n to control his desires and emotions, guiding him toward self-realization.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>JESSICA<|>Leto feels bitterness toward Jessica for putting him through a dangerous spice trance, similar to what happened to Alia.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ALIA<|>Leto pities Alia, who fell into Abomination due to fear, and fears the same fate.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GHANIMA<|>Leto and Ghanima shared fears and memories, influencing each other's paths.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUKE LETO<|>Duke Leto is one of the ancestral memories within Leto, representing his past.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>BARON HARKONNEN<|>Baron Harkonnen is another ancestral memory within Leto, representing a dark past.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>Leto envisions a future without Shai-Hulud, which would mean no more spice.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>DUNE<|>Dune is the planet central to Leto's visions and the spice trance.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SPICE TRANCE<|>Leto is undergoing a spice trance, experiencing visions and inner conflicts.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>Leto seeks the Golden Path, a future where humanity is saved from chaos.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>JESSICA<|>Gurney Halleck is following Jessica's orders in administering the spice trance to Leto.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAMRI<|>JESSICA<|>Namri is following Jessica's instructions in the spice trance process.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SABIHA<|>NAMRI<|>Sabiha is involved in monitoring Leto during his spice trance, as part of Namri's plan.<|>6\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
