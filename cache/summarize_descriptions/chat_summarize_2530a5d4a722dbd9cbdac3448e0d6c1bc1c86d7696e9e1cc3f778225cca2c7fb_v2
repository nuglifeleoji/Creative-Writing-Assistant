His reign as the Tyrant left an enduring legacy on the desert world, which became inextricably linked to his presence and the sandworms. Rakis serves as the focal point of Leto II's history, housing both the remnants of his rule and the sacred sandworms, which are central to the planet's cultural and ecological identity. The planet is thus a testament to the God Emperor's influence, embodying his dual nature as both ruler and mythical creature.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Rakis as the site of Leto II's metamorphosis and enduring power, where his legacy as the Tyrant and his connection to the sandworms remain deeply ingrained.
