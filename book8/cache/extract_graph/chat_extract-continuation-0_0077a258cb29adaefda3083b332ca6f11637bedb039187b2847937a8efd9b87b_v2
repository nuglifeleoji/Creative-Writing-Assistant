新艺人唐乐。经纪人乐卿灵。据悉，星唐传媒内部已经决定要重金打造这位新星。今天专门为他举办本次发布会，也充分证实了这一点。星唐传媒乃是母星最大的传媒集团之一，横跨影视、音乐等多个领域，从事制作、发行、演艺经纪等活动。更是母星最大的艺人经纪公司。能让其如此重视的新人，应该会有非常优秀的素质，让我们期待吧。”\n\n    画面变化，一行人走了出来。走在最前面的是一名巧笑嫣然的少女，相貌很美，但却衣着朴素。在她身后，跟着一名身材高大的男子，但这名男子身体周围却笼罩着点点星光，无法看到他真实样貌。唯一能辨别出的是他那足有一米九开外的身高。除此之外，还有几名身穿正装的工作人员。\n\n    “发布会现在开始。大家好，我是星唐传媒斗罗区艺人经纪公司总监北天鸿，今天为什么举办这次发布会想必各位记者朋友们都已经从各方面得到消息了。而我要告诉你们的是，你们的消息还并不完整。”\n\n    北天鸿是一名四十多岁模样的中年人，身材高大，相貌堂堂。\n\n    在娱乐圈，这位可是赫赫有名的人物。星唐传媒最重要的大区就是斗罗区，也就是整个斗罗星区域。而星唐传媒的几个板块之中，艺人经纪板块更是极为重要的。能够成为斗罗大区艺人经纪公司总经理。他在娱乐圈绝对可以用位高权重来形容了。不知道是多少艺人巴结的对象。\n\n    所以，当他一出现在现场，就已经引起了记者们的惊讶声。这可只是一名新人出道而已啊！却能让北天鸿亲自来站台，可想而知，星唐传媒对于这名新人的重视程度。\n\n    “那完整的消息是什么呢？”下面已经有记者在问了。\n\n    北天鸿微微一笑，“完整的消息是，我代表星唐传媒宣布，唐乐先生正式加盟星唐。同时，唐乐先生将会是未来星唐重点培养的星际巨星。他的第一首单曲将会在一个月之后发布，届时，将会是所有联邦行政星，除去两颗魂兽星之外，同步发布。”\n\n    此言一出，全场哗然！\n\n    这意味着什么太明显了。哪怕是对于星唐传媒这样的大公司来说，所有人类居住行政星同步发布一首单曲这种事儿也实在是太过惊人。在星唐传媒的历史上，这种情况也只是出现过十几次而已，而每一次，无不是国际巨星。\n\n    为了一个新人，星唐传媒如此的不惜代价，这简直了……\n\n    这也让记者们更加关注这位新人究竟有怎样的魅力。\n\n    南澄此时都不禁好奇起来，忍不住道：“星唐传媒是不是疯了？一个新人，至于的吗？”\n\n    蓝潇微微一笑，“存在即合理。星唐传媒无疑是聪明的，他们越是这样，这位新人就越是引人瞩目，等单曲发行的时候，自然会是让人期\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
