\n　　自从他们“正式”恋爱后，吴仲平就不止一次提出，要带她去他们家，但兰香每次都婉言拒绝了。 \n　　她是后来才知道仲平的父母是干什么的——“官”还很不小哩！是的，在一个省里，省委副书记是个显赫职务。不知为什么，兰香内心深处对此感到某种“遗憾”。本来，她希望吴仲平也是个一般人家的子弟。不是她自己有什么门当户对的观念，而是她怕别人有这种观念——她担心和难以忍受的正是这一点。 \n　　她是农民孙玉厚的女儿，是因为她的天资和刻苦精神，才使她来到这个令人瞩目的大学；否则，她就是乡下一个普通的劳动妇女，怎么可能结识吴仲平这样的男青年……这个省委领导的家庭，能接受这样一个农民的女儿吗？ \n　　正因为有这种疑虑，尽管吴仲平一再热心地要带她去他们家，她一直犹豫着没有答应。她无法对仲平说出她不去的理由。当然，她知道，不管他父母对她和她那卑微的家庭出身怎么看，仲平都不可能割舍与她的感情。但即是这样，她也同样难以忍受——因为尽管她出身低贱，可自小一直是在一个很重感情的家中长大的……兰香归根结底是农民的女儿，又在一种艰苦的乡村环境中成长起来，不论她的思想怎样在地球以外的遥远太空飞翔，感情却仍然紧密地和北方那个荒凉的小山村联结在一起。她象她二哥一样，经常会带着无比温暖的感情想起亲爱的双水村。哦，东拉河水也流进了她的血管，一直渗透进她的精神气质中！ \n　　在外表上，我们是再也看不见原来的那个孙兰香了。但实际上兰香仍然是兰香。比如，她还曾想利用课余时间和星期天，到外面去干点什么活，以减轻二哥的负担——入学三年来，二哥每月都要给她几十块生活费。她并且把这想法写信告诉了二哥。她原来估计二哥会支持她，因为她忘不了上中学时，二哥那封关于人要自强的信；正是在二哥的教导下，她当时才去县医院的工地上提包赚钱的。 \n　　不料，二哥回信坚决反对她这样做，还问她是否钱不够用？如果不够，他每月再增加一些。慌得她赶忙打消了这主意，并写信让二哥千万不要再多寄钱给她……去年夏季到现在，兰香一直操心着少平的情况。她知道，晓霞姐的死，对二哥的打击太大了。她真担心二哥会被这个创伤折磨得一蹶不振。她先是在仲平那里知道晓�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
