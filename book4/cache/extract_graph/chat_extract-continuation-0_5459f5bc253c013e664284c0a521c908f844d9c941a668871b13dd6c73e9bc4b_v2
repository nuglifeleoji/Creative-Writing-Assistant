\n　　列车在向前飞驰，穿过河西走廊，穿过兰州，穿过无边的山峦，驶向青海。 \n　　思绪逆着时光在向后倒退，退回流逝的岁月，退到当年，退到那片绿色的草原和那些个红霞艳艳的傍晚……金波带着那个搪瓷缸，带着一颗狂热执迷的心，眼里含着酸楚的泪水，风尘仆仆，来到了青海。 \n　　他在西宁下了火车，即刻又搭上驶往当年部队驻地那里的长途汽车。 \n　　随着目的地越来越近，他在车箱里激动得坐立不安。 \n　　已经眺见了远方地平线上那一列列戴雪冠的山脉。无边的草原在视野中一直铺向天边。深秋的草原已经开始发黄了。 \n　　一切都是那样熟悉！马群在哪里？为什么没有听见那支歌？ \n　　他百感交集，脸紧贴着车窗玻璃，难以相信他真的又回到了这地方。 \n　　当金波来到当年的部队驻地时，大吃一惊：呀！这里竟然变成了一座小镇？他看见，一片密密麻麻的房屋和几座大楼组成了一个繁荣的市镇。一条街道通过镇中心，两边是各种小店铺。街上行走的人，有藏族、也有汉族。象内地一样，到处都有出售衣服的小摊贩。竹竿上挑挂着从全国各地流来的时新服装，花花绿绿，在深秋的冷风中飘扬招展。卖小吃的生意人吆喝声四起。 \n　　部队的营房吗？军马场呢？ \n　　营房还在。不过，大门口挂着一块贸易货栈的牌子。军马场已经不见了踪影，而变成了一个交易牧畜的场所。 \n　　金波站当年熟悉的地方，面对着眼前陌生的一切，硒惶得真想哭一鼻子。 \n　　但是，这并不意味着他此行的愿望就要落空。不，也许他亲爱的人现在就生活在这个市镇上。他发现这里有许多藏民。他已经留心过街上的那些藏族姑娘，看是否能意外地发现他要寻找的人。 \n　　他在一个小旅馆里住下来。然后，便立刻跑到各种机关去打问他当年的部队和那个军马场的下落。 \n　　没有人能回答他的问题。 \n　　当别人听说他要找一个连名字也不知道的藏族姑娘时，都忍不住笑了。 \n　　大概有人发现他不太正常，第二天晚上就有个民警找到他旅馆的房间来，详细查看了他的证件，并询问了有关的问题。 \n　　这位民警听了他的叙述，感到十分惊讶。不过，他看来受了点感动，答应帮助他查问一下他要找的人。 \n　　三天过去了，金波仍然一无所获。他几乎跑遍了镇上的所有单位，在街头辨认了所有往来的藏族姑娘，但没有发现他要找的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
