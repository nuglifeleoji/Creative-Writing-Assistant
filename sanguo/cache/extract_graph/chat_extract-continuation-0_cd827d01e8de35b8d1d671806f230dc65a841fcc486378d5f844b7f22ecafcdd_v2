明。孔明随唤向导土人问之。土人曰：“目今炎天，毒聚泸水，日间甚热，毒气正发，有人渡水，必中其毒；或饮此水，其人必死。若要渡时。须待夜静水冷，毒气不起，饱食渡之，方可无事。”孔明遂令土人引路，又选精壮军五六百，随着马岱，来到泸水沙口，扎起木筏，半夜渡水，果然无事，岱领着二千壮军，令土人引路，径取蛮洞运粮总路口夹山峪而来。那夹山峪，两下是山，中间一条路，止容一人一马而过。马岱占了夹山峪，分拨军士，立起寨栅。洞蛮不知，正解粮到，被岱前后截住，夺粮百余车，蛮人报入孟获大寨中。此时孟获在寨中，终日饮酒取乐，不理军务，谓众酋长曰：“吾若与诸葛亮对敌，必中奸计。今靠此泸水之险，深沟高垒以待之；蜀人受不过酷热，必然退走。那时吾与汝等随后击之，便可擒诸葛亮也。”言讫，呵呵大笑。忽然班内一酋长曰：“沙口水浅，倘蜀兵透漏过来，深为利害；当分军守把。”获笑曰：“汝是本处土人，如何不知？吾正要蜀兵来渡此水，渡则必死于水中矣。”酋长又曰：“倘有土人说与夜渡之法，当复何如？”获曰：“不必多疑。吾境内之人，安肯助敌人耶？”正言之间，忽报蜀兵不知多少，暗渡泸水，绝断了夹山粮道，打着“平北将军马岱”旗号。获笑曰：“量此小辈，何足道哉！”即遣副将忙牙长，引三千兵投夹山峪来。\n\n    却说马岱望见蛮兵已到，遂将二千军摆在山前。两阵对圆，忙牙长出马，与马岱交锋，只一合，被岱一刀，斩于马下。蛮兵大败走回，来见孟获，细言其事。获唤诸将问曰：“谁敢去敌马岱？”言未毕，董荼那出曰：“某愿往。”孟获大喜，遂与三千兵而去。获又恐有人再渡泸水，即遣阿会喃引三千兵，去守把沙口。却说董荼那引蛮兵到了夹山峪下寨，马岱引兵来迎。部内军有认得是董荼那，说与马岱如此如此。岱纵马向前大骂曰：“无义背恩之徒！吾丞相饶汝性命，今又背反，岂不自羞！”董荼那满面惭愧，无言可答，不战而退。马岱掩杀一阵而回。董荼那回见孟获曰：“马岱英雄，抵敌不住。”获大怒曰：“吾知汝原受诸葛亮之恩，今故不战而退，正是卖阵之计！”喝教推出斩了。众酋长再三哀告，\n######################\nOutput:",
