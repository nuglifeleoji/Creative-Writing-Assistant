A trusted operative of the Bene Gesserit, Burzmali is deeply involved in their strategic missions, particularly those concerning the ghola of Duncan Idaho on Gammu. He reports directly to Mother Superior Taraza and is tasked with securing the ghola for the Sisterhood’s purposes, demonstrating expertise in military strategy, subterfuge, and tactical leadership.  \n\nBurzmali plays a critical role in orchestrating the escape and protection of Duncan and Lucilla, employing decoys and unexpected maneuvers to evade threats. He guides Lucilla through the dangers of Gammu, often disguised—such as posing as a field worker named Skar—while remaining vigilant and protective. His military training and strategic thinking mirror Teg’s, making him an invaluable asset in high-stakes operations.  \n\nDespite his competence, Burzmali’s fate is ambiguous. Some accounts claim he was killed defending Lampadas against the Honored Matres, while others suggest he may have been captured or gone into hiding. His whereabouts are questioned by Odrade, adding uncertainty to his final status. Nevertheless, his legacy as Teg’s most trusted subordinate and a key Bene Gesserit operative remains undisputed.  \n\nBurzmali’s involvement extends to interactions on Rakis and Gammu, where he collaborates with Lucilla and other allies, ensuring the success of the Sisterhood’s plans.
