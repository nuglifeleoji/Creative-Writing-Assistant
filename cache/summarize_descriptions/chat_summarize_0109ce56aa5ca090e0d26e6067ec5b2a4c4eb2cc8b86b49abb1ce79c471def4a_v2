It represents a sanctioned and structured form of hostility, often marked by sworn oaths and strategic plots. Duke Leto Atreides is known to have declared **KANLY** against the Harkonnens, formalizing their bitter rivalry. This concept underscores the deep-seated animosity and political machinations between the two Houses, where vengeance and honor play central roles.
