今天的实战考核，第一名：蓝轩宇、刘锋、钱磊。”此言一出，全班一片哗然。事实上，除了被蓝轩宇三人打败的吕千寻小组，还有被偷袭干掉的金翔小组，其他组在迷宫中都没见到蓝轩宇三人。\n\n    这可是一直都垫底的小组啊！刘锋和钱磊的实力是什么水平，大家都清楚得很。\n\n    怎么可能是他们？怎么会是他们拿了冠军?可是，这话是从大魔王季洪彬嘴里说出来的，由不得学员们不相信，而且也没人敢质疑，只是每个人看向蓝轩宇他们的目光都充满了诧异。\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百零九章 收徒\n\n    “不服气？”面带笑容的副院长缓缓走到季洪彬身边，看着学员们说道。\n\n    吕千寻此时正目光灼灼地看着蓝轩宇，其实真正正面对抗了蓝轩宇三人的，就只有他带领的这个小组。\n\n    直到此刻，他都还没有完全明白当时发生了什么。\n\n    自己分明已经通过黄金狮子吼掌控了局面，可接下来那召唤之门中出现的女孩是谁？还有，蓝轩宇那一声龙吟又是怎么回事？其他学员因为蓝轩宇小组获得冠军而感到吃惊和不解，但吕千寻并非如此，他心中更多的是忌惮。\n\n    因为直到此时，他体内的血脉依旧在激荡着，那是一种充斥着惊恐的激荡。\n\n    黄金狮王武魂带给他的黄金血脉何等强势，从开始修炼到现在，几年来，他在这方面从来都是压制别人，又何曾被别人压制过?可是，事实摆在眼前，蓝轩宇那一声龙吟就是扭转了战局。\n\n    “你们可以回去休息或者自行修炼了。”副院长见没人吭声，摆了摆手。“蓝轩宇，你留一下。”季洪彬说道。\n\n    蓝轩宇也不知道为什么自己会被留下，事实上，他现在只想赶快回宿舍，测试一下自己的魂力，看是不是真的像感觉中那样有所提升。\n\n    刘锋和钱磊都看了看他，此时两人眼中满是兴奋的光芒。\n\n    冠军啊！这是妥妥的逆袭啊！这固然是他们一直都期待的，可现在真的拿到了冠军，他们还是有种不敢置信的感觉。\n\n    他们怎么也想不到，他们组竟然能够正面战胜吕千寻小组。\n\n    毫无疑问，这场实战考核，蓝轩宇至关重要，没有他作为核心，钱磊和刘锋依旧是垫底的那两个。\n\n    正是蓝轩宇将三人串在一起，才有了他们的强势崛起。\n\n    其他学员都走了，副院长笑眯眯地向蓝轩宇招了招手，道：“你跟我来。”蓝轩宇并不认识他，但很明显，在场的老师中，这位是为首的，这一点�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
