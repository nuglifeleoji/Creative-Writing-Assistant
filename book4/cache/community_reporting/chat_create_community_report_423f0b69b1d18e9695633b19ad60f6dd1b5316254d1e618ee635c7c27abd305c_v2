He is depicted as a noble young man from a respectable family, known for his good qualities and refined demeanor. As a class monitor, he is well-liked by his peers and is characterized by his gentle nature and academic excellence. He successfully entered medical school and is preparing for graduate studies, showcasing his dedication to education and personal growth.\n\nIn his personal life, 顾养民 has a romantic relationship with 郝红梅, which is central to his character development. Their relationship evolves over time, with 顾养民 being portrayed as a supportive partner who provides hope to 郝红梅. However, he also grapples with the expectations of his grandfather and the complexities of his feelings for her. Despite their bond, 郝红梅's past relationship with another character, 少平, creates tension, particularly as 顾养民 has taken away 少平's girlfriend, leading to conflicts with 金波.\n\n顾养民's character is further complicated by his experiences of despair and bullying. He is depicted as someone who has faced challenges, including being bullied by 金波 and others, which leads him to contemplate reporting the incidents to the school. This aspect of his character highlights his vulnerability and the emotional struggles he faces, contrasting with his otherwise polished exterior.\n\nSocially, 顾养民 is a connector among his friends, hosting dinner gatherings and reminiscing about their school days.
