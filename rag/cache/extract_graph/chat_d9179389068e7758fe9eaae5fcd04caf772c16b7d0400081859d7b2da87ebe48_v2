She displays her mechanical marvels, her powers, her wealth. No offer of alliance. Be willing servants, witches, our slaves, and we will forgive much. To gain the last of the Million Planets? More than that, certainly, but an interesting number.\nWith a new caution, Odrade reformed her approach. Reverend Mothers too easily fell into an adaptive pattern. / am, of course, quite different from you but I will unbend for the sake of accord. That would not do with Honored Matres. They would accept nothing to suggest they were not in absolute control. It was a statement of Dama’s superiority over her Sisters that she allowed Odrade so much latitude.\nOnce more, Dama spoke in her imperious manner.\nOdrade listened. How odd that Spider Queen thought one of the most attractive things the Bene Gesserit could provide was immunity from new diseases.\nWas that the form of attack that drove them here?\nHer sincerity was naive. None of this tiresome periodic checking to see if you had acquired secret inhabitants in your flesh. Sometimes not so secret. Sometimes disgustingly perilous. But the Bene Gesserit could end all that and would be suitably rewarded.\nHow pleasant.\nStill that vindictive tone in every word. Odrade caught herself in this thought: Vindictive? That did not catch the proper flavor. Something carried at a deeper level.\nUnconsciously jealous of what you lost when you broke away from us!\nThis was another pattern and it had been stylized!\nHonored Matres fell back on repetitious mannerisms.\nMannerisms we abandoned long ago.\nThis was more than refusal to recognize Bene Gesserit origins. This was garbage disposal.\nDrop your discards wherever they lose your interest. Underlings take out the garbage. She is more concerned with the next thing she wants to consume than she is with fouling her own nest.\nThe Honored Matre flaw was larger than suspected. Much more deadly to themselves and all they controlled. And they could not face it because, to them, it was not there.\nNever existed.\nDama remained an untouchable paradox. No question of alliance entered her mind. She would seem to dance up to it but only to test her enemy.\n| was right after all to unleash Teg.\nLogno came out of the workroom with a tray on which stood two spindly glasses almost filled with golden liquid. Dama took one, sniffed it, and sipped with a pleased expression.\nWhat is that vicious glitter in Logno’s eyes?\n“Try some of this wine,” Dama said, gesturing to Odrade. “It’s from a planet I’m sure you’ve never heard of but where we have concentrated the required elements to produce the perfect golden grape for the perfect golden wine.”\nOdrade was caught by this long association of humans with their precious ancient drink. The god Bacchus. Berries fermented on the bush or in tribal containers.\n“It is not poisoned,” Dama said as Odrade hesitated. “l assure you. We kill where it suits our needs but we are not crass. We reserve our more blatant deadliness for the masses. | do not mistake you for one of the masses.”\nDama chuckled at her own witticism. The labored friendliness was almost gross.\nOdrade took the proffered glass and sipped.\n“It’s a thing someone devised to please us,” Dama said, her attention fixed on Odrade.\nThe one sip was enough. Odrade’s senses detected a foreign substance and she was several heartbeats identifying its purpose.\nTo nullify the shere protecting me from their probes.\nShe adjusted her metabolism to render the substance harmless, then announced what she had done.\nDama glared at Logno. “So that is why none of these things work with the witches! And you never suspected!” The rage was an almost physical force directed at the hapless aide.\n“It is one of the immune systems with which we combat disease,” Odrade said.\nDama hurled her glass to the tiles. She was some time regaining composure. Logno retreated slowly, holding the tray almost as a Shield.\nSo Dama did more than sneak into power. Her Sisters consider her deadly. And so must I consider her.\n“Someone will pay for this wasted effort,” Dama said. Her smile was not pleasant.\nSomeone.\nSomeone made the wine. Someone made the dancing figure. Someone will pay. The identity was never important, only the pleasure or the need for retribution. Subservience.\n“Do not interrupt my thoughts,” Dama said. She went to the parapet and gazed at her Being Unknown, obviously recomposing her bargaining stance.\nOdrade turned her attention to Logno. What was that continued watchfulness, rapt attention fixed on Dama? No longer simple fear. Logno suddenly appeared supremely dangerous.\nPoison!\nOdrade knew it as certainly as though the aide had shouted the word.\nlam not Logno’s target. Not yet. She has taken this opportunity to make her bid for power.\nThere was no need to look at Dama. The moment of Spider Queen’s death was visible on Logno’s face. Turning, Odrade confirmed it. Dama lay in a heap under Being Unknown.\n“You will call me Great Honored Matre,” Logno said. “And you will learn to thank me for it. She (pointing at the red heap in the balcony corner) intended to betray you and exterminate your people. | have other plans. | am not one to destroy a useful weapon at the moment of our greatest need.”\nBattle? There’s always a desire for breathing space motivating it somewhere.\n—THE BASHAR TEG\nurbella watched the struggle for Junction with a\ndetachment that did not reflect her feelings. She stood with a coterie of Proctors in her no-ship’s command center, attention fixed on relay projections from groundside comeyes.\nThere were battles all around Junction—bursts of light on darkside, gray eruptions on dayside. A major engagement directed by Teg centered on “the Citadel”—a giant mound of Guild design with a new tower near its rim. Although Odrade’s vital-signs transmissions had stopped abruptly, her early reports confirmed that Great Honored Matre was in there.\nThe need to observe from a distance helped Murbella’s sense of detachment but she felt the excitement.\nInteresting times!\nThis ship contained precious cargo. The millions from Lampadas were being Shared and prepared for Scattering in a suite ordinarily reserved for Mother Superior. The wild Sister with her cargo of Memory dominated their priorities here.\nGolden Egg for sure!\nMurbella thought of the lives being risked in that suite. Preparing for the worst. No lack of volunteers and the threat in the Junction conflict minimized need for spice poison to ignite Sharings, reducing danger. Anyone on this ship could\nsense all-or-nothing in Odrade’s gamble. Imminent threat of death was recognized. Sharing necessary!\nTransformation of a Reverend Mother into sets of memories passed around at perilous cost among the Sisters no longer carried a mysterious aura for her, but Murbella still was awed by the responsibility. The courage of Rebecca...and Lucilla! ... demanded admiration.\nMillions of Memory Lives! All concentrated in what the Sisterhood called Extremis Progressiva, two by two then four by four and sixteen by sixteen, until each held all of them and any survivor could preserve the precious accumulation.\nWhat they were doing in Mother Superior’s suite had some of that flavor. The concept no longer terrified Murbella but it was not yet ordinary. Odrade’s words comforted.\n“Once you have fully accommodated to the bundles of Other Memory, all else falls into a perspective that is utterly familiar, as though you had known it always.”\nMurbella recognized that Teg was prepared to die in defense of this multiple awareness that was the Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit.\nCan | do less?\nTeg, no longer completely an enigma, remained an object of respect. Odrade Within amplified this with reminders of his exploits, then: “/ wonder how I’m doing down there? Ask.”\nComcommand said, “No word. But her transmissions may have been blocked by energy shielding.”\nThey knew who really asked the question. It was on their faces.\nShe has Odrade!\nMurbella again focused on the battle at the Citadel.\nHer own reactions surprised Murbella. Everything colored by historical disgust at repetition of war’s nonsense, but still this exuberant spirit reveling in newly acquired Bene Gesserit abilities.\nHonored Matre forces had good weapons down there, she noted, and Teg’s heat-absorption pads were taking punishment but even as she watched, the defensive perimeter collapsed. She could hear howling as a large Idaho-designed disrupter went bouncing down a passage between tall trees, Knocking out defenders right and left.\nOther Memory gave her a peculiar comparison. It was like a circus. Ships landing, disgorging their human cargoes.\n“In the center ring! The Spider Queen! Acts never before seen by the human eye!”\nOdrade’s persona produced a sense of amusement. How’s this for closeness of sisterhood?\nAre you dead down there, Dar? You must be. Spider Queen will blame you and be enraged.\nTrees placed long afternoon shadows across Teg’s lane of attack, she saw. Inviting cover. He ordered his people to go around. Ignore inviting avenues. Look for hard ways to approach and use them.\nThe Citadel lay in a gigantic botanical garden, strange trees and even stranger bushes mingled with prosaic plantings, all scattered around as though thrown there by a dancing child.\nMurbella found the circus metaphor attractive. It gave perspective to what she witnessed.\nAnnouncements in her mind.\nOver there, dancing animals, defenders of Spider Queen, all bound to obey! And in the first ring, the main event, supervised by our Ringmaster, Miles Teg! His people do mysterious things. Here is the talent!\nIt had aspects of a staged battle in the Roman Circus. Murbella appreciated the allusion. It made observation richer.\nBattle towers filled with armored soldiers approach. They engage. Flames cut the sky. Bodies fall.\nBut these were real bodies, real pains, real deaths. Bene Gesserit sensitivities forced her to regret the waste.\nIs this how it was for my parents caught in the sweep?\nMetaphors from Other Memory vanished. She saw Junction then as she knew Teg must see it. Bloody violence, familiar in memory and yet new. She saw attackers advancing, heard them.\nWoman’s voice, distinct with shock: “That bush screamed at me!”\nAnother voice, male: “No telling where some of this Originated. That sticky stuff burns your skin.”\nMurbella heard action on the far side of the Citadel but it grew eerily quiet around Teg’s position. She saw his troops flitting through shadows, closing in on the tower. There was Teg on Streggi’s shoulders. He took a moment to stare up at the façade confronting them about half a klick away. She chose a projection that looked where he looked. Motion behind windows there.\nWhere were the mysterious last-ditch weapons Honored Matres were supposed to possess?\nWhat will he do now?\nTeg had lost his Command Pod to a laser hit outside the main engagement area. The pod lay on its side behind him and he sat astride Streggi’s shoulders in a patch of screening bushes, some still smoldering. He had lost his comboard with the pod but retained the silvery horseshoe of his comlink, although it was crippled without the pod’s amplifiers. Communications specialists crouched nearby, jittering because they had lost close contact with the action.\nThe battle beyond the buildings grew louder. He heard hoarse shouts, the high hissing of burners and the lower buzz of large lasguns\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d9179389068e7758fe9eaae5fcd04caf772c16b7d0400081859d7b2da87ebe48_v2"}
