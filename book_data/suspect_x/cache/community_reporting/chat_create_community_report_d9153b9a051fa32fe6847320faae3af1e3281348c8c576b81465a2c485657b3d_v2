They are closely associated with Shuloch and are infamous for their hostile actions, including contaminating Paul Atreides with spice essence, which induced visions in him. Driven by a desire for retribution, the Cast Out pose a significant threat due to their ruthless tactics and deep-seated grudges. Their history as survivors of Jacurutu underscores their resilience and enduring animosity, making them a formidable force in their pursuit of vengeance.\",2\r\n574,ASSAN TARIQ,\"**ASSAN TARIQ** is a multifaceted character with significant roles across different contexts. He is primarily known as a young guide who serves **The Preacher**, acting as his surrogate eyes and leading him through **Arrakeen**. This suggests a close, possibly mentor-protégé relationship between Assan and The Preacher, with Assan playing a crucial role in aiding The Preacher's navigation or mission.  \n\nAdditionally, Assan Tariq is identified as **Muriz's son**, undergoing a violent manhood test that involves executing captives. This ritual appears to be part of his grooming as a future judge in **Shuloch**, indicating his importance within the societal or political structures of Shuloch. However, there is mention of him not returning to Shuloch, which may imply a divergence from this path or a connection to **Leto's vision**, though the exact nature of this relationship remains unclear.  \n\nWhile these descriptions present slightly differing facets of Assan Tariq—ranging from a guide to a figure undergoing a brutal rite of passage—they collectively paint a picture of a young man caught between duty, mentorship, and possibly a larger destiny. His ties to The Preacher, Shuloch, and Leto's vision suggest he occupies a pivotal, if ambiguous, role in the broader narrative. The contradictions may reflect different stages of his life or varying perspectives on his character, but they ultimately converge on his significance as a figure in transition, shaped by both violence and guidance.  \n\n(Word count: 199)\",3\r\n593,MURIZ,\"**Muriz** is a Fremen leader of the Cast Out, serving as an *arifa* (judge) in Shuloch, where he oversees brutal rituals and enforces the old ways, including the test of manhood for his son. A ruthless and wary figure, he possesses deep knowledge of Fremen traditions and is deeply committed to preserving the desert ways, distrusting mentats and outsiders who threaten their customs.  \n\nMuriz is also involved in spice smuggling as part of a renegade group and is an accomplice of Palimbasha, easily swayed into conspiracies, including one against Ghanima. Despite his harsh demeanor, he engages with key figures such as Leto Atreides II and Sabiha, discussing the Spirit River and the unfolding events in Shuloch. Leto once revealed the *Typhoon Struggle* to him, indicating a relationship with Leto’s broader vision.  \n\nAs a commanding authority, Muriz seeks visions and directs actions, though he grapples with emotional struggles, particularly concerning the Spirit River. His character embodies the tension between ruthless tradition and the shifting dynamics of Fremen society, making him a complex and influential figure among the Cast Out.\",10\r\n594,KRALIZEC,\"**KRALIZEC**, also known as the **Typhoon Struggle**, is a legendary and prophesied apocalyptic event, often described as a cataclysmic war or battle marking the end of the universe. Referenced by **Leto II** as both a promise to **Muriz** and a pivotal moment in his vision for humanity's survival, Kralizec symbolizes a time of immense upheaval, transformation, and turmoil.  \n\nThe event is deeply ingrained in **Fremen culture**, representing not only a mythical or historical conflict but also embodying their enduring struggles and despair. Leto II himself is said to personify Kralizec in his hybrid form, further cementing its significance as a harbinger of profound change. Descriptions vary slightly, with some emphasizing its role as a **prophesied end-times battle**, while others frame it as a broader period of chaos and renewal. However, all accounts agree that Kralizec is a defining moment—whether literal or symbolic—in the fate of the universe and humanity.  \n\nThe term **\"\"Typhoon Struggle\"\"** underscores its destructive yet transformative nature, suggesting a force that reshapes existence. Whether interpreted as a singular battle or an era of reckoning, Kralizec remains a central, unifying mythos in the narrative of Leto II's rule and the broader cosmic destiny he sought to influence.\",5\r\n871,GOYGOA,\"GOYGOA is a rural village nestled in a round pocket of green hills, characterized by its peaceful atmosphere, orchards, and terraced gardens. Once known as Shuloch, it was historically a haunted place where great crimes were committed, but it has since transformed into a tranquil settlement. The village features stone buildings and narrow streets, where residents such as Irti and her family live.  \n\nGOYGOA also serves as a safe haven for Idaho and Siona, who are quartered in a Guest House. Leto considers the area secure, reinforcing its reputation as a sheltered and hospitable location. The combination of its scenic landscape—lush hills and cultivated orchards—along with its storied past and present serenity, makes GOYGOA a unique blend of history and renewal.  \n\nDespite its dark history as Shuloch, the village now thrives as a quiet, agrarian community, offering refuge and stability to its inhabitants. The contrasting descriptions—of its haunted past and its current peacefulness—highlight its transformation over time, with no remaining contradictions in its present state. GOYGOA stands as a testament to resilience, where the echoes of its troubled history are softened by the tranquility of its modern-day life.\",4\r\n592,SHULOCH,\"**Shuloch** is a hidden Fremen settlement on Arrakis, shrouded in myth and secrecy. Believed by many to be a legend, it is in fact a real location serving as a base for renegades, smugglers, and the Cast Out—a group associated with rituals, executions, and clandestine activities. The settlement is an enclosed desert basin, home to a mix of ancient and modern traditions, where inhabitants utilize ornithopters and spice harvesters while maintaining Fremen customs.  \n\nShuloch holds significant narrative importance as the site of pivotal events, including Leto Atreides II's early transformation and his eventual escape. It is also tied to key figures such as Gurney Halleck, who collaborates with the Cast Out there, and Assan Tariq, who originates from Shuloch but is unable to return. The settlement is further linked to interactions involving Leto, Sabiha, and Muriz, as well as being the destination of The Preacher.  \n\nHistorically, Shuloch was once known as *Goygoa*, meaning \"\"haunted place,\"\" due to its dark past as the site of great crimes before its original inhabitants were eradicated. Despite its ominous reputation, Shuloch remains a vital and enigmatic location in the unfolding events on Arrakis, blending danger, tradition, and hidden power.\",8\r\n710,BEHALETH,\"Behaleth is a Fremen who serves as Muriz's companion, often accompanying them in the 'thopter. Though a silent presence during interactions with Leto, Behaleth is notably armed, suggesting a role as a guard or protector in addition to being a trusted associate. Their quiet demeanor does not diminish their significance, as their armed status implies a readiness to act if needed. Together with Muriz, Behaleth forms part of a duo whose dynamic balances silence with vigilance, reflecting the practical and often perilous nature of their shared endeavors.\",1\r\n716,THE SPIRIT RIVER,\"The Spirit River is a significant emotional and possibly spiritual concept for Muriz, affecting his decisions and actions.\"\"\",1\r\n575,ASSAN TARIG,\"**Assan Tarig** is a young and dangerous guide from Shuloch, known for his association with **The Preacher**. He serves as a guide for The Preacher, describing their surroundings and aiding him in their travels. However, Assan Tarig is also a member of the **Cast Out**, a group with hostile intentions. His allegiance to this faction leads him to attempt to kill both **Leto** and The Preacher, revealing his treacherous and volatile nature. Despite his role as a guide, his actions underscore his dangerous and unpredictable disposition, making him a significant threat to those around him.  \n\nIn summary, Assan Tarig is a complex figure—appearing as a helpful guide while simultaneously harboring violent intentions as a member of the Cast Out. His dual role creates tension, as his loyalty ultimately lies with his faction, leading him to betray those he is supposed to assist.\",4\r\n872,IRTI,\"Irti is the wife of Idaho's predecessor and mother to his children, living in Goygoa>\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1559,CAST OUT,PAUL,\"Paul was contaminated by the Cast Out, who fed him spice essence and plied him with visions.\",117\r\n1194,THE PREACHER,ASSAN TARIQ,\"**Summary of THE PREACHER and ASSAN TARIQ:**  \n\nTHE PREACHER is closely associated with ASSAN TARIQ, who serves as his guide through the city of Arrakeen. Their relationship is one of dependence, as THE PREACHER relies on ASSAN TARIQ to act as his \"\"surrogate eyes,\"\" indicating that THE PREACHER may be visually impaired or otherwise unable to navigate independently. ASSAN TARIQ’s role is critical in ensuring THE PREACHER’s movement and orientation within Arrakeen, highlighting a partnership built on trust and necessity. Together, they form a dynamic where ASSAN TARIQ provides essential support, enabling THE PREACHER to fulfill his purpose or journey within the city.  \n\nThis summary consolidates the provided descriptions into a coherent narrative, emphasizing the interdependent nature of their relationship.

They are often seen operating in a 'thopter, suggesting they collaborate on missions or travel as a team. While both descriptions emphasize their partnership, one specifies that Behaleth serves as a guard, indicating a protective or defensive role within their dynamic. This does not contradict their broader association as renegades but rather adds detail to their relationship. Together, they form a cohesive unit, with Muriz likely fulfilling another role—possibly as a pilot, strategist, or fellow combatant—though the exact nature of their partnership beyond companionship and shared allegiance remains unspecified.
