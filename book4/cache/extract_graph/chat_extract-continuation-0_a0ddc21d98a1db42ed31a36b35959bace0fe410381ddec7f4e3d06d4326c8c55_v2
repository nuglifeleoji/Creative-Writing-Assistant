\n　　向前抬起头不好意思地笑了，说：“你要是迟回来十分钟，我就会把你的鞋重新钉好的。” \n　　于是，润叶推着丈夫，来到了客厅。 \n　　向前赶快在一个小柜后面拉出了他的“百宝箱”。润叶看见，卧室床下所“丢失”的鞋都在这里。有她的，也有他的，有些完好无缺的鞋被丈夫拆成一烂包；有些拆烂鞋又被他重新钉缀了起来。她刚才要寻找的那双灰颜色的布鞋，一只显然拆烂后已经钉好，另一只鞋头部分只有不大一小口了。她这才想起，她刚进门时听见这里有叮叮咣咣的声音——原来他不再是修理其它东西，而是在学着钉鞋哩！润叶不免饶有兴致地拉了把小凳坐在丈夫面前，说：“你钉，叫我看看你的手艺怎样了！” \n　　向前立刻摆开架势，操起工具，开始为妻子“表演”。他两只手有力而灵巧，已经满象个熟练的钉鞋匠了！不过，由于在妻子注目下操作，显得有些紧张，锥子好几次险些戳在指头蛋上！ \n　　润叶看着，一直忍不住笑。这不是为他的窘态失笑，而是她真的感到高兴。那双长期转方向盘而磨练出来的手，是那样充满活力和机巧！他现在就可以说是个出色的钉鞋匠了！还不到十分钟，那只鞋就钉好了。 \n　　向前把鞋递给她，舌头舔了舔嘴唇，不好意思地说：“你试试，看什么地方不合适？” \n　　润叶把脚上的泥鞋脱掉，穿上了那双被“钉好”的灰布鞋，站起走了几步，高兴地说：“和原来一样合脚！”有什么能比得上妻子的夸奖更令他兴奋呢？ \n　　几天以后，润叶就把向前要去钉鞋的打算，给公公和婆婆说了。 \n　　李登云和刘志英都惊得张大嘴巴。他们当然表示了反对的态度。 \n　　“家里又不是没钱花嘛！我和你爸除过你们，这辈子还有什么牵挂！只要你们需要，你们就尽量花，何必……”刘志英着急地对儿媳妇说。 \n　　“不是钱的问题……”润叶说。 \n　　“那是？”李登云瞪大了眼睛。 \n　　润叶接着就给两个老人讲了许多道理。虽然局长书记都是一辈子“说道理”的人，但有些道理他们原先未必就懂。经儿媳妇一番开导，才使他们接受了一些有关生活的“新思维”。 \n　　既然儿媳妇这样在“理论上”和“实践上”支持儿子去当钉鞋匠，李登云夫妇尽管心里仍然有些“那个”，最后也都勉强同意了。唉，是呀，对他们来说，仍然还存在个“面子”问题，但只要儿媳妇乐意，他们还再能说什么呢？\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
