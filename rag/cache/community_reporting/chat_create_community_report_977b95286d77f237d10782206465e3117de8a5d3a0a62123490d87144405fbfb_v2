Central to this project is the resurrection of **Duncan Idaho**, a key historical figure, whose ghola form is tied to the Bene Gesserit's political and economic power struggles. The project involves not only the awakening of these gholas but also their training and protection, with notable figures such as **Miles Teg** and **Lucilla** tasked with safeguarding and guiding them.  \n\nThe project's objectives appear multifaceted: it serves as a means to resurrect influential figures from the past, potentially for strategic or ideological purposes, while also playing a role in the Bene Gesserit's broader, long-term plans. Duncan Idaho's ghola, in particular, is emphasized as a critical component, suggesting his unique importance to the sisterhood. However, the project has encountered complications, including the reported disappearance of the ghola alongside Teg and Lucilla, indicating potential instability or external interference.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing the resurrection of Duncan Idaho specifically, others referencing gholas more generally—the overarching theme remains consistent: the **GHOLA PROJECT** is a high-stakes endeavor by the Bene Gesserit to harness the power of gholas, with Duncan Idaho's resurrection serving as a focal point. The project underscores the Bene Gesserit's manipulation of genetic memory, political influence, and clandestine operations to further their goals.\",7\r\n948,DUNCAN IDAHO GHOLA,\"The **Duncan Idaho Ghola** is a clone of the original Duncan Idaho, a pivotal character in the *Dune* series. This ghola represents the twelfth attempt by the Bene Gesserit to recreate Duncan Idaho, underscoring the significance of his genetic and psychological template. At nearly six years old, the ghola is being carefully raised and conditioned by the Bene Gesserit for undisclosed future purposes, hinting at their long-term strategic plans.  \n\nAs a ghola, he retains the memories and essence of the original Duncan Idaho, a loyal swordsmaster and trusted ally of House Atreides. The Bene Gesserit's repeated efforts to replicate him suggest his unique value, whether for his combat prowess, genetic traits, or potential role in their broader schemes. The combination of his cloned identity and the Bene Gesserit's involvement positions him as a critical figure in the unfolding events of the *Dune* universe.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions, confirming that the ghola is both a clone and a product of the Bene Gesserit's experimentation, with no inherent contradictions between the two statements. His age and the number of attempts to recreate him further contextualize his importance in the narrative.\",5\r\n951,LUCILA,\"**Lucilla** is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Imprinter, a highly trained operative of the Sisterhood with expertise in seduction, psychological manipulation, and Voice. She is primarily tasked with the conditioning and protection of the ghola Duncan Idaho, using advanced imprinting techniques to bond him to the Bene Gesserit. Her role involves teaching Duncan about love in all its forms, employing both emotional and sexual manipulation as tools for his training. Lucilla is cautious, perceptive, and skilled in combat, with access to Other Memories, which inform her decisions.  \n\nAssigned to replace Geasa in Duncan’s education, Lucilla exhibits a cold demeanor and seductive eyes, resembling Odrade due to careful Bene Gesserit breeding. She is involved in political maneuvers around Duncan, often clashing with figures like Schwangyu over alliances with the Tleilaxu. Her loyalty to the Sisterhood is generally unwavering, though her actions are sometimes scrutinized, and she faces conflicting orders regarding Duncan’s conditioning.  \n\nAt times, Lucilla works alongside Miles Teg to safeguard Duncan, though she questions his methods and remains suspicious of his behavioral changes. She is also associated with Gammu Keep, where she operates in disguise, navigating the planet’s dangers with Burzmali while carrying critical intelligence for the Sisterhood. Her mission occasionally extends beyond Duncan’s training, including involvement in strategic operations against the Honored Matres.  \n\nLucilla’s story takes darker turns: she is captured by the Honored Matres on Junction, enduring interrogation and deprivation as leverage against the Bene Gesserit. In some accounts, she is killed by the Great Honored Matre, highlighting the violent conflict between the two groups. Other narratives place her missing alongside Teg and Duncan or in hiding on Gammu, hunted by a Guild Navigator.  \n\nDespite her disciplined exterior, Lucilla experiences emotional turmoil, including hatred toward the people of Rakis. She is a complex figure—ruthless yet strategic, manipulative yet devoted—embodying the Bene Gesserit’s calculated approach to power and survival. Whether as a teacher, captive, or fugitive, her actions remain pivotal to the Sisterhood’s plans.\",27\r\n952,SCHWANGYU,\"**Schwangyu** is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who commands the Keep on Gammu and plays a contentious role in the Sisterhood’s internal politics. A staunch opponent of the ghola project, she oversees the training and education of Duncan Idaho, often obstructing his quest for knowledge through harsh discipline, secrecy, and punitive measures, which fuels his hatred and fear of her. Schwangyu’s actions frequently clash with the plans of other key Bene Gesserit figures, particularly Taraza and Miles Teg, whom she openly opposes.  \n\nHer leadership is marked by suspicion and dissent; she monitors the ghola project closely, prepared to abort it at the first sign of trouble. Some accounts suggest she may have been subverted by the Bene Tleilaxu, forming a pact that led to an attack on Teg’s quarters. This alliance, along with her emotional instability and desperation, underscores her conflicting loyalties and possible complicity in violent schemes. Schwangyu’s distrust extends to Lucilla and Duncan, whom she views as threats, and she is implicated in the capture and likely death of Patrin for information extraction.  \n\nDespite her authority, Schwangyu’s predictability and opposition to Taraza’s agenda render her a liability within the Sisterhood. Her eventual death during an attack on the Keep leaves behind a cryptic message about her assailants, further complicating her legacy. While some portray her as a disciplined but overly rigid leader, others depict her as a traitorous figure whose actions destabilize Bene Gesserit operations. Ultimately, Schwangyu embodies the factional strife within the Sisterhood, representing both its authoritarian control and its vulnerabilities to betrayal.\",12\r\n958,TEG,\"**Bashar Miles Teg** is a revered military leader, Mentat, and key figure in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, renowned for his strategic brilliance, combat prowess, and loyalty. Trained by the Bene Gesserit and possessing enhanced abilities—possibly due to a T-probe or other external stimuli—he exhibits heightened perception, physical speed, and deep strategic insight. Teg serves as a mentor and father figure to Duncan Idaho, overseeing his training and the painful restoration of his original memories, a process he finds distasteful but necessary.  \n\nTeg’s military career is marked by his leadership in critical conflicts, including battles against the Honored Matres and the Tleilaxu. He has orchestrated strategic attacks on Gammu and Junction, employing unconventional tactics that outmaneuver opponents like Schwangyu. Captured and tortured by the Honored Matres at one point, he later escapes, demonstrating resilience and resourcefulness. His connection to the Atreides lineage is noted, with physical resemblance to Duke Leto and inherited traits like moral superiority and mental acuity.  \n\nAs a Bene Gesserit operative, Teg is deeply involved in their plans, including the ghola project and safeguarding Duncan. He is trusted by Mother Superior Odrade, who considers him the Sisterhood’s finest military leader, and he carries out high-stakes missions, such as evacuations and command transfers. Teg’s legacy includes a gallant last stand on Gammu, and his ghola counterpart is later trained by Duncan, eager to reclaim his original memories.  \n\nBalancing roles as a warrior, strategist, and mentor, Teg’s influence extends across the Sisterhood’s political and military spheres. His actions are pivotal to their survival, whether in combat, training the next generation, or resisting interrogation with his Mentat discipline. Revered by allies like Burzmali and feared by enemies, Teg remains a linchpin in the Bene Gesserit’s struggle for dominance.\",75\r\n965,LUCILIA,\"**Lucilla** is a prominent Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and a key figure within the Sisterhood, known for her involvement in high-stakes missions, breeding programs, and the protection of critical assets. She serves as the vice chancellor of Lampadas, though she is presumed dead at some point, indicating a complex and possibly clandestine role in Bene Gesserit operations.  \n\nLucilla is deeply entwined in the Sisterhood's plans, particularly those involving the ghola Duncan Idaho. She observes the ghola alongside Mother Superior Taraza and is later tasked with protecting both Miles Teg and the ghola during their escape, though Teg does not fully trust her. Her skills include secret tricks and advanced Bene Gesserit techniques, underscoring her value as a operative.  \n\nShe operates within a parallel cell of the Sisterhood, working on missions that align with—but may diverge from—the broader goals of the order. At one point, she seeks temporary sanctuary with the Rabbi's group, hinting at moments of vulnerability or strategic retreat. Lucilla is also speculated to have discerned Duncan Idaho's serial memories, potentially confiding her suspicions to her fellow Sisters, further highlighting her perceptiveness and role in the Sisterhood's intricate schemes.  \n\nDespite contradictions in her status (such as being presumed dead yet actively involved in missions), her overarching role remains consistent: a skilled and resourceful Reverend Mother navigating the Bene Gesserit's secretive agendas, from training and breeding programs to high-risk protective duties. Her multifaceted involvement suggests she is a trusted yet enigmatic figure within the order.\",9\r\n979,DIMELA,\"Dimela is the eldest daughter of Miles Teg and is married to Firus. She assists in managing the family estate, demonstrating her involvement in practical affairs. However, Dimela also harbors reservations about her father's alignment with Bene Gesserit practices, indicating a tension between her familial duties and her personal views on the political and philosophical influences surrounding her family. This duality highlights her role as both a supportive family member and an individual with independent concerns. Her relationship with her father, Miles Teg, appears complex, balancing loyalty with skepticism toward his affiliations. Overall, Dimela is portrayed as a pragmatic yet thoughtful figure within the Teg household.\",2\r\n1121,RENDITAI,\"**Renditai** was a minor skirmish in Teg's military history, where he commanded loyal soldiers and fought alongside others who later became his allies. This past battle or event played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of Teg's followers, as many of those who fought with him eventually settled in Ysai. While the conflict itself was relatively small in scale, its aftermath fostered lasting bonds among the participants, reinforcing Teg's leadership and the loyalty of his companions. The event is remembered as a pivotal moment that contributed to the cohesion of Teg's forces and their subsequent presence in Ysai.  \n\nIn summary, Renditai was a brief but consequential engagement in Teg's career, uniting soldiers who would later support him and establish themselves in Ysai. The skirmish underscores the interconnectedness of Teg's military endeavors and the enduring relationships forged through shared combat.\",2\r\n1069,YSAI,\"**YSAI** is a major city on the planet Gammu, serving as a hub of activity and a key destination for various factions and individuals. It is a place of both danger and strategic importance, characterized by its chaotic, disorganized structure, with ancient and mismatched buildings reflecting its long history. Notably, Ysai was once the ancient Harkonnen seat of Barony, adding to its historical significance.  \n\nThe city is marked by a prominent black rectangular building, known to Miles Teg as the location of the \"\"puppet masters,\"\" suggesting a center of power or control. Ysai is also a destination for Teg, who seeks safety there after his attack on the Honored Matres, with allies assisting his journey. The city's outskirts feature overgrown tracks, as seen when Duncan Idaho and Tormsa traveled through them.  \n\nFunctionaries with datacases are commonly observed in Ysai, indicating bureaucratic or administrative activity. The city serves as a Bene Gesserit operational base, featuring advanced security systems and a safe address for their agents. Lucilla and Burzmali must travel there under disguise, highlighting its perilous nature. Teg is also believed to have gone to ground in Ysai, reinforcing its role as a refuge despite its dangers.  \n\nIn summary, Ysai is a sprawling, chaotic metropolis on Gammu with deep historical roots, serving as a nexus of political intrigue, covert operations, and survival for key figures like Teg, Duncan, and Bene Gesserit operatives. Its blend of ancient architecture, advanced security, and strategic importance makes it a focal point in the unfolding events on Gammu.\",2\r\n1157,PERSONAL SERVICE,\"Personal Service is the name of the eating establishment where Teg meets Delnay, known for its traditional and high-quality food\"\"\",2\r\n974,FIRUS,\"**FIRUS** is Dimela's husband and plays a key role in managing Teg's estate. Alongside Patrin, he is also privy to Teg's specific intentions and preferences concerning the South Farm, indicating his involvement in both estate management and decision-making related to Teg's agricultural holdings. This dual role highlights FIRUS's trusted position within Teg's affairs, serving as both a familial support to Dimela and a knowledgeable figure in executing Teg's directives.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively portray FIRUS as a reliable and informed individual, entrusted with responsibilities that span both personal and estate-related matters. There are no contradictions in the provided information; rather, the details complement each other to present a cohesive picture of his roles and relationships.\",1\r\n976,LERNAEUS,\"**LERNAEUS** is a planet that serves as the homeworld of **Firus** and the **Roxbroughs**, as well as the location of **Teg's** expansive research garden. As the primary residence of these individuals, Lernaeus holds significance both as a dwelling place and a site of scientific exploration. The planet's environment supports diverse flora, as evidenced by Teg's dedicated garden, which is used for extensive research purposes. While the descriptions do not provide further details about Lernaeus's climate, geography, or societal structure, it is clear that the planet plays a central role in the lives of its inhabitants, functioning as both a home and a hub for botanical study.  \n\nThe coexistence of residential and research facilities suggests that Lernaeus may have a balanced ecosystem capable of sustaining both natural life and controlled cultivation. Whether Teg's garden is a private endeavor or part of a larger scientific institution remains unspecified, but its presence underscores the planet's importance as a place of learning and discovery alongside its role as a homeworld.  \n\nIn summary, Lernaeus is a multifaceted planet, serving as the native world for Firus and the Roxbroughs while also hosting Teg's research garden, indicating its dual significance as a living space and a center for botanical study.\",1\r\n981,JANET ROXBROUGH,\"Janet Roxbrough was Teg's mother, a Reverend Mother from the Lernaeus Roxbroughs.\"\"\",1\r\n1043,GAMMU KEEP,\"**Gammu Keep** is a significant location that serves multiple roles in the events described. It was previously attacked by forces resembling those threatening Burzmali's group, making it a tactical reference point for understanding the attackers' methods. Additionally, Gammu Keep marks the beginning of the journey undertaken by Teg, Lucilla, and Duncan as they traverse the wilderness. It is also the place where Teg awakens after entering a Mentat trance, further highlighting its importance as a pivotal site in their narrative. Together, these details paint Gammu Keep as a strategic and symbolic location, tied to both past conflicts and the unfolding journey of key characters.\",1\r\n1083,MARKON,The Battle of Markon is a historical event where Teg's reputation caused the enemy to sue for terms.,1\r\n1084,ARBELOUGH,The Battle of Arbelough is a historical event where Teg shared risks with his troops and spared the enemy.,1\r\n1085,KROININ,The assault on Kroinin is a historical event where Teg broke the anti-Sisterhood forces.,1\r\n1112,LERNEAUS,\"**Lernaeus** is the home planet of Janet Roxbrough, the birth-mother of the prominent figure Teg. It also served as Teg's childhood home, where he had formative encounters with Bene Gesserit acolytes, including Carlana. The planet holds personal significance in Teg's early life, tying his familial roots to his later experiences with the Bene Gesserit. While no further details about Lernaeus's geography, culture, or political affiliations are provided, its role in Teg's upbringing and connections to key individuals underscores its importance in his personal history.\",1\r\n1123,PLANETARY BANK OF GAMMU,The Planetary Bank of Gammu owns the groundcar Teg is using for transport. It was one of his contact points during his inspection tour.,1\r\n1126,SOLITZ,\"**SOLITZ** is a trained **Suk doctor** who specializes in medical examinations and treatments. Recognizable by the **orange brand or tattoo** on his forehead—a distinctive mark of his Suk training—he is skilled in assessing and addressing health concerns. In one instance, he examines **Teg**, likely evaluating the aftereffects of a stunner, and prescribes a meal tailored to Teg's specific needs. His expertise and attention to individual requirements highlight his proficiency as a medical professional within the Suk tradition. The descriptions align in portraying him as a competent and attentive healer, with minor variations in terminology (brand vs. tattoo) that do not contradict his identity or role.  \n\n(Word count: 100)\",1\r\n1154,YSAL,\"Ysai is the city where Teg is currently located, seeking help and refuge\"\"\",1\r\n1155,ACLINE,\"Acline is another past battle where Teg served, known for saving many lives\"\"\",1\r\n1291,HAKER,\"**HAKER** serves as **Teg's personal aide**, assisting in various capacities during combat and tactical operations. Primarily, Haker is responsible for providing updates to Teg and executing orders during battles. Additionally, Haker plays a key role in managing **Honored Matre prisoners**, ensuring compliance with Teg's directives. This dual responsibility highlights Haker's importance in both active combat support and post-conflict operations, acting as a trusted subordinate in Teg's command structure.  \n\nThe descriptions align in depicting Haker as a loyal and efficient aide, consistently carrying out Teg's orders in high-stakes situations. There are no contradictions; rather, the details complement each other to form a cohesive role encompassing battlefield coordination and prisoner oversight.\",1\r\n1292,COMMAND POD,\"Teg's Command Pod is a critical piece of military equipment that was destroyed in the battle\"\"\",1\r\n70,DUNCAN,\"**Duncan Idaho** is a ghola (a genetically resurrected clone) created by the Tleilaxu, originally decanted from an axlotl tank. As a clone of the legendary Duncan Idaho, he possesses both pre-ghola and restored memories, including a deep hatred for the Harkonnens and recollections of his past life as a loyal retainer of House Atreides. Trained as a Mentat, swordmaster, and warrior, he is skilled in combat, strategy, and Bene Gesserit teachings, often serving as a key figure in political and military affairs.  \n\nDuncan’s roles vary widely: he is a trusted agent of House Atreides, a Royal Guard Commander, and a central figure in the God Emperor’s breeding program. He has been married to Alia, though their relationship is distant, and later becomes the partner of Murbella, whose Agony and transformation into a Bene Gesserit he influences emotionally. His cleverness with women, particularly his involvement with Hwi Noree, poses a potential threat to the God Emperor’s plans.  \n\nUnder the guidance of Miles Teg and Lucilla, Duncan undergoes intense training to revive ancient combat methods and adapt them to modern techniques. He is also tasked with restoring the Bashar’s memories and plays a critical role in Bene Gesserit strategies, including Sheeana’s escape from Chapterhouse and missions to Rakis involving sandworms. Despite his loyalty to the Atreides, he resists Bene Gesserit control and navigates personal conflicts, balancing his past identity with his current role.  \n\nDuncan is often a figure of unrest—sent away by Moneo due to Fish Speakers' attachment to him, confined in a no-ship, or involved in high-stakes negotiations. His latent abilities, forbidden Tleilaxu-implanted knowledge, and extraordinary sensory skills make him both an asset and a wildcard. Whether as a protector, strategist, or emotional anchor for Murbella, Duncan remains a pivotal, enigmatic presence in the empire’s unfolding destiny.  \n\n(Word count: 298)\",45\r\n955,MILES TEG,\"**Miles Teg** is a complex and multifaceted figure in Bene Gesserit history, embodying roles as a military leader, Mentat, ghola, and key strategist. A ghola clone of the original Bashar Miles Teg, he was raised by the Bene Gesserit, displaying exceptional intelligence, memory, and latent Mentat abilities from a young age. He is the son of Janet and Loschy Teg, with Atreides ancestry, and the father of Odrade, whose last words hold significance for the Bene Gesserit.  \n\nTeg serves as a Bashar—a revered military leader and Mentat—tasked with critical missions, including reinforcing planetary defenses, leading battles (such as the conflict at Junction against the Honored Matres), and mentoring figures like Burzmali and Duncan Idaho. Known for his strategic brilliance, audacity, and improvisation in combat, he earned the nickname \"\"Old Reliability\"\" for his unwavering loyalty and resemblance to Duke Leto Atreides.  \n\nHis relationship with the Bene Gesserit is deep yet nuanced; he is both a conditioned servant and a reflective figure, balancing philosophical and tactical considerations. Teg was assigned as Duncan Idaho’s guardian and weapons master, overseeing his training and reawakening through harsh methods, though he often withheld information, fostering tension. He also collaborated with Lucilla and other Bene Gesserit operatives, aware of their broader schemes.  \n\nAt times, Teg is depicted as a retired leader recalled to duty, while elsewhere he appears as a young ghola undergoing memory restoration. These contradictions resolve when considering his cyclical existence: the original Teg’s legacy persists through his ghola, who inherits his predecessor’s skills and memories. Whether as a seasoned commander or a resurrected prodigy, Miles Teg remains a pivotal figure in Bene Gesserit operations, embodying military genius, loyalty, and the order’s enduring influence.\",27\r\n443,GHOLA,\"**GHOLA** is a cloned individual, specifically a recreation of the deceased Duncan Idaho, created through Tleilaxu genetic engineering. As a ghola, he possesses the potential to restore the memories of his original self, making him a pivotal figure in Bene Gesserit schemes and broader narrative events. Trained as a mentat and a skilled warrior, he serves Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib) with loyalty, offering both strategic insight and philosophical challenges to Paul’s rule.  \n\nGHOLA’s role is multifaceted: he is both a servant and a destabilizing force. His presence unsettles Alia, who perceives him as mysterious and potentially dangerous, while his interactions with Paul serve as an emotional and ideological counterpoint. His metal eyes mark him as a Tleilaxu creation, and he is often entangled in political conspiracies, including negotiations and covert missions.  \n\nAt times, GHOLA is captured or controlled by factions such as Murbella’s group, highlighting his value as a strategic asset. Under the Bene Gesserit’s supervision—particularly by Lucilla and Teg—he undergoes rigorous training, further honing his abilities. Whether as a weapon, a philosophical provocateur, or a pawn in larger schemes, GHOLA remains a central and enigmatic figure whose restored memories and actions drive key events in the narrative.  \n\nIn summary, GHOLA is a clone of Duncan Idaho, embodying his original skills and memories while serving as a tool, a mentor, and a wildcard in the power struggles surrounding Paul Muad’Dib and the Bene Gesserit. His existence blurs the line between resurrection and manipulation, making him a source of tension, intrigue, and pivotal narrative developments.\",11\r\n1109,YAR,\"**YAR** is a male functionary responsible for the interrogation and monitoring of Teg using a T-probe console. Described as having a sullen voice, he operates the advanced interrogation device, adjusting pain levels and closely observing Teg's reactions during the process. YAR is known to suggest extreme measures in the course of his duties, indicating a ruthless or uncompromising approach to his role. His primary function revolves around the use of the T-probe, a tool designed to extract information or manipulate subjects through controlled pain and sensory feedback. Collectively, the descriptions portray YAR as a cold, methodical interrogator, focused on his task with little regard for the subject's well-being.  \n\nThe summaries align in depicting YAR as a key operator of the T-probe, emphasizing his direct involvement in Teg's interrogation. While one description highlights his vocal demeanor (\"\"sullen voice\"\"), another underscores his technical role in adjusting pain levels, reinforcing his hands-on control over the process. The mention of \"\"extreme measures\"\" suggests a willingness to escalate interrogation tactics, further solidifying his reputation as a severe and unyielding figure.  \n\nIn summary, YAR is a male interrogator who employs the T-probe as his primary tool, meticulously monitoring and manipulating Teg's responses. His demeanor is characterized by a sullen tone, and his methods are marked by a readiness to employ harsh measures, painting him as a formidable and relentless functionary in his field.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2123,BENE GESSERIT,GHOLA PROJECT,\"The **Bene Gesserit**, a powerful and secretive sisterhood in the *Dune* universe, is currently deeply invested in the **Ghola Project**, a key initiative central to their broader strategic efforts. This project focuses on the resurrection of **Duncan Idaho**, a skilled swordsman and loyal ally, through the creation of a ghola—a cloned replica with restored memories. The Bene Gesserit's involvement in the Ghola Project underscores its significance to their long-term plans, though the exact nature of these plans remains shrouded in secrecy.  \n\nThe sisterhood's dedication to the project highlights its importance as both a scientific and political endeavor, likely tied to their manipulation of bloodlines and the pursuit of their ultimate goal: the Kwisatz Haderach. By resurrecting Duncan Idaho, the Bene Gesserit may seek to harness his combat prowess, genetic traits, or past loyalties for their own purposes. The Ghola Project is not merely an experiment but a calculated move in their intricate schemes, reflecting their mastery of genetics, memory manipulation, and long-term strategy.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize the Bene Gesserit's active role in the project, they do not conflict; rather, they reinforce the idea that the Ghola Project is a priority for the sisterhood.

She is known for her strict and secretive nature, often employing harsh punishments, which has fostered resentment in Duncan. He harbors a strong dislike for her due to these methods and her lack of transparency.  \n\nSchwangyu’s role involves overseeing Duncan’s development, and she remains prepared to terminate the project if she deems it necessary. Her vigilance suggests a deep-seated distrust or a mandate to ensure strict compliance with the project’s objectives. Despite Duncan’s animosity, Schwangyu’s actions appear driven by duty rather than personal malice, though her methods exacerbate tensions between them.  \n\nIn summary, their relationship is marked by conflict: Duncan resents Schwangyu’s authoritarian approach, while she maintains control over his fate as part of her responsibilities. The dynamic is one of surveillance, discipline, and underlying hostility, with Schwangyu holding the power to decide the project’s continuation.\",116\r\n2168,TEG,TARAZA,\"**TEG and TARAZA**  \n\nTeg and Taraza are key figures within the Bene Gesserit, with Taraza serving as Teg’s superior. Their relationship is defined by hierarchy, loyalty, and collaboration on critical missions. Taraza holds authority over Teg, who follows her orders meticulously, demonstrating unwavering dedication to her directives. As a Mentat Bashar, Teg executes Taraza’s strategic plans with precision, combining his military expertise with her broader Bene Gesserit objectives.  \n\nOne of their most significant collaborations involves the Duncan Idaho ghola, for which Taraza recruits Teg to undertake a crucial mission. This highlights Taraza’s trust in Teg’s capabilities and his role as a reliable enforcer of her designs. Their partnership extends beyond this mission, as they frequently work together on Bene Gesserit matters, aligning Teg’s tactical brilliance with Taraza’s overarching leadership.  \n\nIn summary, Teg serves Taraza with steadfast loyalty, functioning as both her subordinate and trusted operative.
