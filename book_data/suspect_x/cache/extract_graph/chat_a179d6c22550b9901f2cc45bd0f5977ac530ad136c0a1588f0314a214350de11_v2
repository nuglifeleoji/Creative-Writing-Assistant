He noted the care with which she sealed the end, but she did not pull the face flap across her mouth, although Leto had heard her father warning her about this. She wanted her mouth free for talking!\n“You're telling me | can’t run away from you,” she said.\n“Run away if you want.”\nShe turned a full circle, examining the wasteland.\n“There is a saying about the open land,” he said, “that one direction is as good as another. In some ways, that’s still true, but | would not depend on it.”\n“But I’m really free to leave you if | want?”\n“Freedom can be a very lonely estate,” he said.\nShe pointed to the steep side of the dune on which they had stopped. “But | could just go down there and...”\n“Were | you, Siona, | would not go down where you are pointing.”\nShe glared at him. “Why?”\n“On the dune’s steep side, unless you follow the natural curves, the sand may slide down upon you and bury you.”\nShe looked down the slope, absorbing this.\n“See how beautiful words can be?” he asked.\nShe returned her attention to his face. “Should we be going?”\n“You learn to value leisure out here. And courtesy. There’s no hurry.”\n“But we have no water except the...”\n“Used wisely, that stillsuit will keep you alive.”\n“But how long will it take us to...”\n“Your impatience alarms me.”\n“But we have only this dried food in my pouch. What will we eat when...”\n“Siona! Have you noticed that you are expressing our situation as mutual. What will we eat? We have no water. Should we be going? How long will it take us?”\nHe sensed the dryness of her mouth as she tried to swallow.\n“Could it be that we’re interdependent?” he asked.\nShe spoke reluctantly. “I don’t know how to survive out here.”\n“But | do?”\nShe nodded.\n“Why should I share such precious knowledge with you?” he asked.\nShe shrugged, a pitiful gesture which touched him. How quickly the desert cut away previous attitudes.\n“I will share my knowledge with you,” he said. “And you must find something valuable that you can share with me.” Her gaze traversed his length, paused a moment at the flippers which once were his legs and feet, then came back\nto his face.\n“Agreement bought with threats is no agreement,” she said.\n“| offer you no violence.”\n“There are many kinds of violence,” she said.\n“And | brought you out here where you may die?”\n“Did | have a choice in it?”\n“It is difficult to be born an Atreides,” he said. “Believe me, | know.”\n“You don’t have to do it this way,” she said.\n“And there you are wrong.”\nHe turned away from her and set off in a sinusoidal track down the dune. He heard her slipping and stumbling as she followed. Leto stopped well into the dune shadow.\n“We'll wait out the day here,” he said. “It uses less water to travel by night.”\nOne of the most terrible words in any language is Soldier.

Since daybreak two hours before, Idaho had been prowling the Citadel seeking the majordomo and there he was, far off down the corridor, talking to someone concealed in a doorway, but Moneo was recognizable even at this distance by his stance and that inevitable white uniform.\nThe corridor’s plastone walls were amber here fifty meters below the surface and lighted by glowstrips keyed to the daylight hours. Cool breezes were drawn into these depths by a simple arrangement of free-swinging wings which stood like gigantic robed figures on perimeter towers at the surface. Now that the sun had warmed the sands, all of the wings pointed northward for the cool air pouring into the Sareer. Idaho smelled the flinty breeze as he walked.\nHe knew what this corridor was supposed to represent. It did have some characteristics of an ancient Fremen sietch. The corridor was wide, big enough to take Leto on his cart. The arched ceiling /ooked like rock. But the twin glowstrips were discord. Idaho had never seen glowstrips before coming to the Citadel; they had been considered impractical in his day, requiring too much energy, too costly to maintain. Glowglobes were simpler and easily replaced. He\nhad come to realize, however, that Leto considered few things impractical.\nWhat Leto wants, someone provides.\nThe thought had an ominous feeling as Idaho marched down the corridor toward Moneo.\nSmall rooms lined the corridor sietch-fashion, no doors, only thin hangings of russet fabric which swayed in the breeze. Idaho knew that this area was mostly quarters for the younger Fish Speakers. He had recognized an assembly chamber with attendant rooms for weapons storage, kitchen, a dining hall, maintenance shops. He had also seen other things behind the inadequate privacy of the hangings, things which fed his rage.\nMoneo turned at Idaho’s approach. The woman to whom Moneo had been talking retreated and let the hanging drop, but not before Idaho glimpsed an older face with an air of command about it. Idaho did not recognize that particular commander.\nMoneo nodded as Idaho stopped two paces away.\n“The guards say you've been looking for me,” Moneo said.\n“Where is he, Moneo?”\n“Where is who?”\nMoneo swept his gaze up and down Idaho’s figure, noting the old-fashioned Atreides uniform, black with a red hawk at the breast, the high boots glistening with polish. There was a ritual look about the man.\nIdaho took a shallow breath and spoke through clenched teeth: “Don’t you start that game with me!”\nMoneo took his attention away from the sheathed knife at Idaho’s waist. It looked like a museum piece with its jeweled handle. Where had Idaho found it?\n“If you mean the God Emperor...” Moneo said.\n“Where?”\nMoneo kept his voice mild. “Why are you so anxious to die?”\n“They said you were with him.”\n“That was earlier.”\n“lIl find him, Moneo!”\n“Not right now.”\nIdaho put a hand on his knife. “Do | have to use force to make you talk?”\n“|I would not advise that.”\n“Where...is... he?”\n“Since you insist, he is out in the desert with Siona.”\n“With your daughter?”\n“Is there another Siona?”\n“What’re they doing?”\n“She is being tested.”\n“When will they return?”\nMoneo shrugged, then: “Why this unseemly anger, Duncan?”\n“What’s this test of your...”\n“I don’t know. Now, why are you so upset?”\n“I’m sick of this place! Fish Speakers!” He turned his head and spat.\nMoneo glanced down the corridor behind Idaho, recalling the man’s approach. Knowing the Duncans, it was easy to recognize what had fed his current rage.\n“Duncan,” Moneo said, “it’s perfectly normal for adolescent females as well as males to have feelings of physical attraction toward members of their own sex. Most of them will grow out of it.”\n“It should be stamped out!”\n“But it’s part of our heritage.”\n“Stamped out! And that’s not...”\n“Oh, be still. If you try to suppress it, you only increase its power.”\nIdaho glared at him. “And you say you don’t know what’s going on up there with your own daughter!”\n“Siona is being tested, | told you.”\n“And what’s that supposed to mean?”\nMoneo put a hand over his eyes and sighed. He lowered the hand, wondering why he put up with this foolish, dangerous, antique human.\n“It means that she may die out there.”\nIdaho was taken aback, some of his anger cooling. “How can you allow...”\n“Allow? You think | have a choice?”\n“Every man has a choice!”\nA bitter smile flitted across Moneo’s lips. “How is it that you are so much more foolish than the other Duncans?”\n“Other Duncans!” Idaho said. “How did those others die, Moneo?”\n“The way we all die. They ran out of time.”\n“You lie.” Idaho spoke past gritted teeth, his knuckles white on the knife handle.\nStill speaking mildly, Moneo said: “Have a care. There are limits even to what | will take, especially just now.”\n“This place is rotten!” Idaho said. He gestured with his free hand at the corridor behind him. “There are some things l'Il never accept!”\nMoneo stared down the empty corridor without seeing. “You must mature, Duncan. You must.”\nIdaho’s hand tensed on the knife. “What does that mean?”\n“These are sensitive times. Anything unsettling to him, anything ... must be prevented.”\nIdaho held himself on the edge of violence, his anger restrained only by something puzzling in Moneo’s manner. Words had been spoken, though, which could not be ignored.\n“I’m not some damned immature child you can...”\n“Duncan!” It was the loudest sound Idaho had ever heard from the mild-mannered Moneo. Surprise stayed Idaho’s hand while Moneo continued: “If the demands of your flesh are for maturity, but something holds you in adolescence, quite nasty behavior develops. Let go.”\n“Are... you... accusing... me... of...”\n“No!” Moneo gestured at the corridor. “Oh, | know what you must’ve seen back there, but it...”\n“Two women in a passionate kiss! You think that’s not...”\n“It’s not important. Youth explores its potential in many ways.”\nIdaho balanced himself on the edge of an explosion, rocking forward on his toes. “I’m glad to learn about you, Moneo.”\n“Yes, well, I’ve learned about you, several times.”\nMoneo watched the effect of these words as they twisted through Idaho, tangling him. The gholas could never avoid a fascination with the others who had preceded them.\nIdaho spoke in a hoarse whisper: “What have you learned?”\n“You have taught me valuable things,” Moneo said. “All of us try to evolve, but if something blocks us, we can transfer our potential into pain—seeking it or giving it. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable.”\nIdaho leaned close to Moneo. “I’m talking about sex!”\n“Of course you are.”\n“Are you accusing me of adolescent...”\n“That’s right.”\n“I should cut your...”\n“Oh, shut up!”\nMoneo’s response did not have the training nuances of Bene Gesserit Voice control, but it had a lifetime of command behind it. Something in Idaho could only obey.\n“I’m sorry,” Moneo said. “But I’m distracted by the fact that my only daughter. . .” He broke off and shrugged.\nIdaho inhaled two deep breaths. “You’re crazy, all of you! You say your daughter may be dying and yet you...”\n“You fool!” Mone\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a179d6c22550b9901f2cc45bd0f5977ac530ad136c0a1588f0314a214350de11_v2"}
