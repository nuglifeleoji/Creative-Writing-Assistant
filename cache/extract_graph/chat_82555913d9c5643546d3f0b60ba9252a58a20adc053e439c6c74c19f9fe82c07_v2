Deep and intense things, but buried. It was all inside there, masked the way a Reverend Mother would mask it. Logno appeared to have no power at all and yet she spoke as though nothing essential had changed.\n“Lam your captive but that makes no difference.”\nWas she truly powerless? No/ But that was the impression she wished to convey and all of the other Honored Matres around her mirrored this response.\n“See us? Powerless except for the loyalty of our Sisters and the followers they have bonded to us.”\nWere Honored Matres that confident of their vengeful legions? Possible only if they had never before suffered a defeat of this kind. Yet someone had driven them back into the Old Empire. Into the Million Planets.\nTeg found Odrade and her captives while seeking a place to assess victory. Battle always required its analytical aftermath, especially from a Mentat commander. It was a comparison test this battle demanded of him more than any other in his experience. This conflict would not be lodged in memory until assessed and shared as far as possible among those who depended on him. It was his invariable pattern and he did not care what it revealed about him. Break that link of interlocking interests and you prepared yourself for defeat.\n| need a quiet place to assemble the threads of this battle and make a preliminary summary.\nIn his estimation, a most difficult problem of battle was to conduct it in a way that did not release human wildness. A Bene Gesserit dictum. Battle must be conducted to bring out the best in those who survived. Most difficult and sometimes all but impossible. The more remote the soldier from carnage, the more difficult. It was one reason Teg always tried to move to the battle scene and examine it personally. If you did not see the pain, you could easily cause greater pain without second thoughts. That was the Honored Matre pattern. But their pains had been brought home. What would they make of this?\nThat question was in his mind as he and aides emerged from the tube to see Odrade confronting a party of Honored Matres.\n“Here is our commander, the Bashar Miles Teg,” Odrade said, gesturing.\nHonored Matres stared at Teg.\nA child riding on the shoulders of an adult? This is their commander?\n“Ghola,” Logno muttered.\nOdrade spoke to Haker. “Take these prisoners somewhere nearby where they can be comfortable.”\nHaker did not move until Teg nodded, then politely indicated that captives should precede him into the tiled area on their left. Teg’s dominance was not lost on Honored Matres. They glowered at him as they obeyed Haker’s invitation.\nMen ordering women about!\nWith Odrade beside him, Teg touched a knee to Streggi’s neck and they went onto the balcony. There was an oddity to the scene that he was a moment identifying. He had viewed many battle scenes from high vantages, most often from a scout ‘thopter. This balcony was fixed in space, giving him a sense of immediacy. They stood about one\nhundred meters above the botanical gardens where much of the fiercest conflict had taken place. Many bodies lay sprawled in final dislodgment—dolls thrown aside by departing children. He recognized uniforms of some of his troops and felt a pang.\nCould | have done something to prevent this?\nHe had known this feeling many times and called it “Command Guilt.” But this scene was different, not just in that uniqueness found in any battle but in a way that nagged at him. He decided it was partly the landscaped setting, a place better suited to garden parties, now torn by an ancient pattern of violence.\nSmall animals and birds were returning, nervously furtive after the upset of all that noisy human intrusion. Little furry creatures with long tails sniffed at casualties and scampered up neighboring trees for no apparent reason. Colorful birds peered from screening foliage or flitted across the scene— lines of blurred pigmentation that became camouflage when they ducked abruptly under leaves. Feathered accents to the scene, trying to restore that non-tranquility human observers mistook for peace in such settings. Teg knew better. In his pre-ghola life, he had grown up surrounded by wilderness: farm life close by but wild animals just beyond cultivation. It was not tranquil out there.\nWith that observation he recognized what had tugged at his awareness. Considering the fact they had stormed a well-manned defensive emplacement occupied by heavily armed defenders, the number of casualties down there was extremely small. He had seen nothing to explain this since entering the Citadel. Were they caught off-balance? Their losses in Space were one thing—his ability to see defender ships produced a devastating advantage. But this complex held prepared positions where defenders could have fallen back and made the assault more costly. Collapse of Honored Matre resistance had been abrupt and now it remained unexplained.\n| was wrong to assume they responded to display of their disasters.\nHe glanced at Odrade. “That Great Honored Matre in there, did she give the command for defense to stop?”\n“That’s my assumption.”\nCautious and a typical Bene Gesserit answer. She, too, was subjecting the scene to careful observation.\nWas her assumption a reasonable explanation for the abruptness with which defenders threw down their arms?\nWhy would they do it? To prevent more bloodshed?\nGiven the callousness Honored Matres usually demonstrated, that was unlikely. The decision had been made for reasons that plagued him.\nA trap?\nNow that he thought about it, there were other strange things about the battle scene. None of the usual calls from wounded, no scurrying about with cries for stretchers and medics. He could see Suks moving among the bodies. That, at least, was familiar, but every figure they examined was left where it had fallen.\nAll dead? No wounded?\nHe experienced gripping fear. Not an unusual fear in battle but he had learned to read it. Something profoundly wrong. Noises, things within his view, the smells took on a new intensity. He felt himself acutely attuned, a predatory animal in the jungle, knowing his terrain but aware of something intrusive that must be identified lest he become hunted instead of hunter. He registered his surroundings at a different level of consciousness, reading himself as well, searching out arousal patterns that had achieved this response. Streggi trembled beneath him. So she felt his distress.\n“Something’s very wrong here,” Odrade said.\nHe pushed a hand at her, demanding silence. Even in this tower surrounded by victorious troops, he felt exposed to a threat his clamoring senses failed to reveal.\nDanger!\nHe was sure of it. The unknown frustrated him. It required every bit of his training to keep from falling into a nervous fugue.\nNudging Streggi to turn, Teg barked an order to an aide standing in the balcony doorway. The aide listened quietly and ran to obey. They must get casualty figures. How many wounded compared to deaths? Reports on captured weapons. Urgent!\nWhen he returned to his examination of the scene, he saw another disturbing thing, a basic oddity his eyes had tried to report. Very little blood on those fallen figures in Bene Gesserit uniforms. You expected battle casualties to show that ultimate evidence of common humanity—flowing red that darkened on exposure but always left its indelible mark in the memories of those who Saw it. Lack of bloody Carnage was an unknown and, in warfare, unknown had a history of bringing extreme peril.\nHe spoke softly to Odrade. “They have a weapon we have not discovered.”\nDo not be quick to reveal judgment. Hidden judgment often is more potent. It can guide reactions whose effects are felt only when too late to divert them.\n—BENE GESSERIT ADVICE TO POSTULANTS\nheeana smelled worms at a distance: cinnamon\nundertones of melange mingled with bitter flint and brimstone, the crystal-banked inferno of the great Rakian sand-eaters. But she sensed these tiny descendents only because they existed out there in such numbers.\nThey are so small.\nIt had been hot here at Desert Watch today and now in late afternoon she welcomed the artifically cooled interior. There was a tolerable temperature adjustment in her old quarters although the window on the west had been left open. Sheeana went to that window and stared out at glaring sand.\nMemory told her what this vantage would be tonight: starlight bright in dry air, thin illumination on sand waves that reached to a darkly curved horizon. She remembered Rakian moons and missed them. Stars alone did not satisfy her Fremen heritage.\nShe had thought of this as retreat, a place and time to think about what was happening to her Sisterhood.\nAxlotl tanks, Cyborgs, and now this.\nOdrade’s plan held no mysteries since their Sharing. A gamble? And if it succeeded?\nWe will know perhaps tomorrow and then what will we become?\nShe admitted to a magnet in Desert Watch, more than a place to consider consequences. She had walked in sun- scorched heat today, proving to herself she could still call worms with her dance, emotion expressed as action.\nDance of Propitiation. My language of the worms.\nShe had gone dervish-whirling on a dune until hunger shattered her memory-trance. And little worms were spread all around in gaping watchfulness, remembered flames within the frames of crystal teeth.\nBut why so small?\nThe words of investigators explained but did not satisfy. “It is the dampness.”\nSheeana recalled giant Shai-hulud of Dune, “the Old Man of the Desert,” large enough to swallow spice factories, ring surfaces hard as plastrete. Masters in their own domain. God and devil in the sands. She sensed the potential from her window vantage.\nWhy did the Tyrant choose symbiotic existence in a worm?\nDid those tiny worms carry his endless dream?\nSandtrout inhabitated this desert. Accept them as a new Skin and she might follow the Tyrant’s path.\nMetamorphosis. The Divided God.\nShe knew the lure.\nDo | dare?\nMemories of her last moments of ignorance came over her—barely eight then, the month of Igat on Dune.\nNot Rakis. Dune, as my ancestors named it.\nNot difficult to recall herself as she had been: a slender, dark-skinned child, streaked brown hair. Melange hunter (because that was a task for children) running into open desert with childhood companions. How dear it felt in memory.\nBut memory had its darker side. Focusing attention into the nostrils, a girl detected intense odors—a pre-spice mass!\nThe Blow!\nMelange explosion brought Shaitan. No sandworm could resist a spice blow in its territory.\nYou ate it all, Tyrant, that miserable collection of shacks and hovels we called “home” and all of my friends and family. Why did you spare me?\nWhat a rage had shaken that slender child. Everything she loved taken by a giant worm that refused her attempts to sacrifice herself in its flames and carried her into the hands of Rakian priests, thence to the Bene Gesserit.\n“She talks to the worms and they spare her.”\n“They who spared me are not spared by me.” That was what she had told Odrade.\nAnd now Odrade knows what I must do. You cannot suppress the wild thing, Dar. | dare call you Dar now that you are within me.\nNo response.\nWas there a pearl of Leto II’Ss awareness in each of the new sandworms? Her Fremen ancestors insisted on it.\nSomeone handed her a sandwich. Walli, the senior acolyte assistant who had assumed command of Desert Watch.\nAt my insistence when Odrade elevated me to the Council. But not just because Walli learned my immunity to Honored Matre sexual bonding.
