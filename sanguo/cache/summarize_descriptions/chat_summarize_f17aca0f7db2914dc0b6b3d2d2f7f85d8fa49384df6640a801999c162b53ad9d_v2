He is currently facing pressure to accept the title of emperor, which would involve conducting a grand ceremony to formally establish his authority and solidify his rule over the dynasty. This title, 汉中王, not only denotes his leadership position but also represents the political weight and historical importance of the Han dynasty within the narrative.\n\nDespite his leadership role, 汉中王 is experiencing feelings of anger and betrayal due to the actions of some of his subjects. This sense of betrayal complicates his position and may influence his decision regarding the acceptance of the emperor title.
