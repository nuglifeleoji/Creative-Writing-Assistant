虽说一年级的学员还小，很多甚至连魂技都还没有。但毕竟强攻系魂师的身体素质一般都要比控制系好，所以，整体优势还是有的。\n\n    “第一场，一年级一班，黄启帆。”一年级一班班主任顺便也把自己第一场派出的学生叫了出来。\n\n    秋雨馨看了一眼他，想了想，道：“蓝轩宇。”\n\n    蓝轩宇一愣，他也没想到秋雨馨第一个会叫他出场。\n\n    秋雨馨有自己的想法，先前叶灵瞳的话她也听到了，对于叶灵瞳她还是知道一些的，这小姑娘的爸爸可是了不得的人物。既然说了有办法用魂技，那确实是比较麻烦的。但身为班长，叶灵瞳肯定是靠后面坐镇的。蓝轩宇是少数拥有魂技的，有魂技显然要比没魂技的强，她觉得还是早点把蓝轩宇拍出来，让他在前面多赢几场更有利。\n\n    从同学之中走出来，身后已经响起一片，“蓝轩宇加油！”\n\n    一年级一班也不示弱，“黄启帆，加油！”\n\n    叶灵瞳站在一年级一班的最前面，大眼睛看着蓝轩宇，心中想着，他可不要一上来就输了，那我就连出气的机会都没有了呢。\n\n    双方站定，秋雨馨和一年级一班班主任龚英豪也站在一旁监督。\n\n    “开始吧。”龚英豪看了秋雨馨一眼，眼底闪过一丝不易察觉的得意。\n\n    黄启帆大叫一声，身上淡淡的黄色光芒涌现，六岁的小小身体竟是明显膨胀了起来，增长到足有九岁孩子身高。一圈黄色魂环也随之从脚下升起。光芒释放。\n\n    他的手臂变得粗壮起来，第一魂技，熊的力量！\n\n    秋雨馨顿时有些错愕的看着这一幕，她记得很清楚，这个黄启帆上学期末的时候应该还没有突破，没有魂环啊！\n\n    战熊，熊类武魂之中比较普通的一种。有一定的土属性控制能力。黄启帆不但有了第一个魂环，而且赫然是百年的。很显然，他的家庭条件是相当不错的。\n\n    而蓝轩宇的武魂是水，对上这种力量型的魂师，绝对是吃亏的。\n\n    不过，再想什么现在都晚了，黄启帆已经朝着蓝轩宇的方向冲了过去。\n\n    看到身材膨胀，明显变得强壮的黄启帆，蓝轩宇也是吓了一跳。下意识的就后退了一步。\n\n    一年级一班班主任龚英豪有些得意的向秋雨馨道：“秋老师，开门红可是很重要的啊！你说是不是？”\n\n    秋雨馨翻了个白眼，“说的好像你们一定能赢似的。”\n\n    “那是……”刚说到这里，龚英豪的眼中却流\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
