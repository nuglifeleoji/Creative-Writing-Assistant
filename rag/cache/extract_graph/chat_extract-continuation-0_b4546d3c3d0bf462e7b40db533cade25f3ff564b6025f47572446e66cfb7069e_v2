To begin with, early space travel, although widespread, was largely unregulated, slow, and\nuncertain, and, before the Guild monopoly, was accomplished by a hodgepodge of methods. The first Space experiences, poorly communicated and subject to extreme distortion, were a wild inducement to mystical speculation.\nImmediately, soace gave a different flavor and sense to ideas of Creation. That difference is seen even in the highest religious achievements of the period. All through religion, the feeling of the sacred was touched by anarchy from the outer dark.\nIt was as though Jupiter in all his descendant forms retreated into the maternal darkness to be Superseded by a female immanence filled with ambiguity and with a face of many terrors.\nThe ancient formulae intertwined, tangled together as they were fitted to the needs of new conquests and new heraldic symbols. It was a time of struggle between beast-demons on the one side and the old prayers and invocations on the other.\nThere was never a clear decision.\nDuring this period, it was said that Genesis was reinterpreted, permitting God to say:\n“Increase and multiply, and fill the universe, and subdue it, and rule over all manner of strange beasts and living creatures in the infinite airs, on the infinite earths and beneath them.”\nIt was a time of sorceresses whose powers were real. The measure of them is seen in the fact they never boasted how they grasped the firebrand.\nThen came the Butlerian Jihad—two generations of chaos. The god of machine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was raised:\n“Man may not be replaced.”\nThose two generations of violence were a thalamic pause for all humankind. Men looked at their gods and their rituals and saw that both were filled with that most terrible of all equations: fear over ambition.\nHesitantly, the leaders of religions whose followers had spilled the blood of billions began meeting to exchange views. It was a move encouraged by the Spacing Guild, which was beginning to build its monopoly over all interstellar travel, and by the Bene Gesserit who were banding the sorceresses.\nOut of those first ecumenical meetings came two major developments:\n1. The realization that all religions had at least one common commandment: “Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.”\n2. The Commission of Ecumenical Translators.\nC.E.T. convened on a neutral island of Old Earth, Spawning ground of the mother religions. They met “in the common belief that there exists a Divine Essence in the universe.” Every faith with more than a million followers was represented, and they reached a surprisingly immediate agreement on the statement of their common goal:\n“We are here to remove a primary weapon from the hands of disputant religions. That weapon—the claim to possession of the one and only revelation.”\nJubilation at this “sign of profound accord” proved premature. For more than a Standard year, that Statement was the only announcement from C.E.T. Men spoke bitterly of the delay. Troubadours composed witty, biting songs about the one hundred\nand twenty-one “Old Cranks” as the C.E.T. delegates came to be called. (The name arose from a ribald joke which played on the C.E.T. initials and called the delegates “Cranks—Effing-Turners.”) One of the songs, “Brown Repose,” has undergone periodic revival and is popular even today:\n“Consider leis.\nBrown repose—and\nThe tragedy\nIn all of those\nCranks! All those Cranks! So laze—so laze Through all your days. Time has toll’d for M’Lord Sandwich!”\nOccasional rumors leaked out of the C.E.T. sessions. It was said they were comparing texts and, irresponsibly, the texts were named. Such rumors inevitably provoked anti-ecumenism riots and, of course, inspired new witticisms.\nTwo years passed...three years.\nThe Commissioners, nine of their original number having died and been replaced, paused to observe formal installation of the replacements and announced they were laboring to produce one book, weeding out “all the pathological symptoms” of the religious past.\n“We are producing an instrument of Love to be played in all ways,” they said.\nMany consider it odd that this statement provoked the worst outbreaks of violence against ecumenism.\nTwenty delegates were recalled by their congregations. One committed suicide by stealing a space frigate and diving it into the sun.\nHistorians estimate the riots took eighty million lives. That works out to about six thousand for each world then in the Landsraad League. Considering the unrest of the time, this may not be an excessive estimate, although any pretense to real accuracy in the figure must be just that—pretense. Communication between worlds was at one of its lowest ebbs.\nThe troubadours, quite naturally, had a field day. A popular musical comedy of the period had one of the C.E.T. delegates sitting on a white sand beach beneath a palm tree singing:\n“For God, woman and the splendor of love We dally here sans fears or cares. Troubadour! Troubadour, sing another melody For God, woman and the splendor of love!”\nRiots and comedy are but symptoms of the times, profoundly revealing. They betray the psychological tone, the deep uncertainties...and the striving for something better, plus the fear that nothing would come of it all.\nThe major dams against anarchy in these times were the embryo Guild, the Bene Gesserit and the Landsraad, which continued its 2,000-year record of meeting in spite of the severest obstacles. The Guild’s part appears clear: they gave free transport for all Landsraad and C.E.T. business. The Bene\nGesserit role is more obscure. Certainly, this is the time in which they consolidated their hold upon the sorceresses, explored the subtle narcotics, developed prana-bindu training and conceived the Missionaria Protectiva, that black arm of superstition. But it is also the period that saw the composing of the Litany against Fear and the assembly of the Azhar Book, that bibliographic marvel that preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths.\nIngsley’s comment is perhaps the only one possible:\n“Those were times of deep paradox.”\nFor almost seven years, then, C.E.T. labored. And as their seventh anniversary approached, they prepared the human universe for a momentous announcement. On that seventh anniversary, they unveiled the Orange Catholic Bible.\n“Here is a work with dignity and meaning,” they said. “Here is a way to make humanity aware of itself as a total creation of God.”\nThe men of C.E.T. were likened to archeologists of ideas, inspired by God in the grandeur of rediscovery. It was said they had brought to light “the vitality of great ideals overlaid by the deposits of centuries,” that they had “sharpened the moral imperatives that come out of a religious conscience.”\nWith the O.C. Bible, C.E.T. presented the Liturgical Manual and the Commentaries—in many respects a more remarkable work, not only because of its brevity (less than half the size of the O.C. Bible), but also because of its candor and blend of self-pity and self-righteousness.\nThe beginning is an obvious appeal to the agnostic rulers.\n“Men, finding no answers to the sunnan [the ten thousand religious questions from the Shari-ah] now apply their own reasoning. All men seek to be enlightened. Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of God’s universe. Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.”\nIn their conclusion, though, the Commentaries set a harsh tone that very likely foretold their fate.\n“Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching Is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you’ve always known.”\nThere was an odd sense of calm as the presses and shigawire imprinters rolled and the O.C. Bible Spread out through the worlds. Some interpreted this as a sign from God, an omen of unity.\nBut even the C.E.T. delegates betrayed the fiction of that calm as they returned to their respective congregations. Eighteen of them were lynched within two months. Fifty-three recanted within the year.\nThe O.C. Bible was denounced as a work produced by “the hubris of reason.” It was said that its pages\nwere filled with a seductive interest in logic. Revisions that catered to popular bigotry began appearing. These revisions leaned on accepted symbolisms (Cross, Crescent, Feather Rattle, the Twelve Saints, the thin Buddha, and the like) and it soon became apparent that the ancient superstitions and beliefs had not been absorbed by the new ecumenism.\nHalloway’s label for C.E.T.’s seven-year effort —\"“Galactophasic Determinism”—was snapped up by eager billions who interpreted the initials G.D. as “God-Damned.”\nC.E.T. Chairman Toure Bomoko, a Ulema of the Zensunnis and one of the fourteen delegates who never recanted (“The Fourteen Sages” of popular history), appeared to admit finally the C.E.T. had erred.\n“We shouldn’t have tried to create new symbols,” he said. “We should’ve realized we weren’t supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted belief, that we weren’t supposed to stir up curiosity about God. We are daily confronted by the terrifying instability of all things human, yet we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled, more conforming and oppressive. What is this shadow across the highway of Divine Command? It is a warning that institutions endure, that symbols endure when their meaning is lost, that there is no summa of all attainable knowledge.”\nThe bitter double edge in this “admission” did not escape Bomoko’s critics and he was forced soon afterward to flee into exile, his life dependent upon the Guild’s pledge of secrecy. He reportedly died on\nTupile, honored and beloved, his last words: “Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, ‘Il am not the kind of person I want to be.’ It must never sink into an assemblage of the self- satisfied.”\nIt is pleasant to think that Bomoko understood the prophecy in his words: “Institutions endure.” Ninety generations later, the O.C. Bible and the Commentaries permeated the religious universe.\nWhen Paul-Muad’Dib stood with his right hand on the rock shrine enclosing his father’s skull (the right hand of the blessed, not the left hand of the damned) he quoted\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LANKIVEIL<|>GEO<|>Lankiveil is a location mentioned in the context of religious texts and beliefs>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIKUN<|>GEO<|>Sikun is a location mentioned alongside Lankiveil in the context of religious texts>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MAHAYANA LANKAVATARA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A religious text or tradition referenced in the context of the Blend Books>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ZEN HEKIGANSHU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Zen text or tradition associated with III Delta Pavonis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TAWRAH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A religious text or tradition surviving on Salusa Secundus>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TALMUDIC ZABUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A religious text or tradition surviving on Salusa Secundus>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SALUSA SECUNDUS<|>GEO<|>A location where the Tawrah and Talmudic Zabur texts survived>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OBEAH RITUAL<|>EVENT<|>A pervasive religious or cultural practice mentioned in the text>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MUAHD QURAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A religious text preserved among the pundi rice farmers of Caladan>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>A location where the Muadh Quran is preserved>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HINDU OUTCROPPINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hindu religious practices found in isolated pockets across the universe>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>EVENT<|>A major historical event involving the overthrow of machine-logic and the rise of human-centric beliefs>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SPACING GUILD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization that monopolized interstellar travel and influenced religious developments>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful group that banded sorceresses and influenced religious and political events>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSION OF ECUMENICAL TRANSLATORS (C.E.T.)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group formed to unify religious texts and beliefs, resulting in the Orange Catholic Bible>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE CATHOLIC BIBLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A unified religious text produced by the C.E.T.>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LANDSRAAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A political body that maintained order during the chaotic period of the Butlerian Jihad>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TOURE BOMOKO<|>PERSON<|>A Ulema of the Zensunnis and chairman of the C.E.T. who never recanted>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>SPACING GUILD<|>Both organizations played key roles in stabilizing the universe during the Butlerian Jihad<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION OF ECUMENICAL TRANSLATORS (C.E.T.)<|>ORANGE CATHOLIC BIBLE<|>The C.E.T. produced the Orange Catholic Bible as a unified religious text<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TOURE BOMOKO<|>COMMISSION OF ECUMENICAL TRANSLATORS (C.E.T.)<|>Toure Bomoko was the chairman of the C.E.T. and a key figure in its efforts<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>The Bene Gesserit consolidated power during the Butlerian Jihad<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>SPACING GUILD<|>The Spacing Guild emerged as a dominant force during the Butlerian Jihad<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTLERIAN JIHAD<|>LANDSRAAD<|>The Landsraad maintained political order during the Butlerian Jihad<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHAYANA LANKAVATARA<|>LANKIVEIL<|>The Mahayana Lankavatara is associated with Lankiveil in religious context<|>4>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ZEN HEKIGANSHU<|>III DELTA PAVONIS<|>The Zen Hekiganshu is linked to III Delta Pavonis<|>4>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAHD QURAN<|>CALADAN<|>The Muadh Quran is preserved among the pundi rice farmers of Caladan<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HINDU OUTCROPPINGS<|>UNIVERSE<|>Hindu outcroppings are found in isolated pockets across the universe<|>3>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
