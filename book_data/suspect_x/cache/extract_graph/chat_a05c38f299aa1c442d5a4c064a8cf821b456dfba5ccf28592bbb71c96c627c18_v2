The realization plunged over Idaho. Moneo saw it, recalling a comment of the God Emperor's: “Your words brand him with the look you want him to have.”\nAs the silence continued, Moneo cleared his throat. Presently, he said: “The immensity of the Lord Leto’s memories has been known to stop my tongue, too.”\n“Is he being honest with us?” Idaho asked.\n“I believe him.”\n“But he does so many ...1! mean, take this breeding program. How long has that been going on?”\n“From the very first. From the day he took it away from the Bene Gesserit.”\n“What does he want from it?”\n“I wish | knew.”\n“But you're...”\n“An Atreides and his chief aide, yes.”\n“You haven't convinced me that a female army is best.”\n“They continue the species.”\nAt last, Idaho’s frustration and anger had an object. “Is that what | was doing with them that first night—breeding?”\n“Possibly. The Fish Speakers take no precautions against\npregnancy.”\n“Damn him! I’m not some animal he can move from stall to stall likea...likea...”\n“Like a stud?”\n“Yes!”\n“But the Lord Leto refuses to follow the Tleilaxu pattern of gene surgery and artificial insemination.”\n“What have the Tleilaxu got to...”\n“They are the object lesson. Even I can see that. Their Face Dancers are mules, closer to a colony organism than to\nhuman.”\n“Those others of...me... were any of them his studs?”\n“Some. You have descendants.”\n“Who?”\n“Lam one.”\nIdaho stared into Moneo’s eyes, lost suddenly in a tangle of relationships. Idaho found the relationships impossible to understand. Moneo obviously was so much older than... Butlam...Which of them was truly the older? Which the ancestor and which the descendant?\n“I sometimes have trouble with this myself,” Moneo said. “If it helps, the Lord Leto assures me that you are not my descendant, not in any ordinary sense. However, you may well father some of my descendants.”\nIdaho shook his head from side to side.\n“Sometimes | think only the God Emperor himself can understand these things,” Moneo said.\n“That’s another thing!” Idaho said. “This god business.”\n“The Lord Leto says he has created a holy obscenity.”\nThis was not the response Idaho had expected. What did I expect? A defense of the Lord Leto?\n“Holy obscenity,” Moneo repeated. The words rolled from his tongue with a strange sense of gloating in them.\nIdaho focused a probing stare on Moneo. He hates his God Emperor! No... he fears him. But don’t we always hate what we fear?\n“Why do you believe in him?” Idaho demanded.\n“You ask if | share in the popular religion?”\n“No! Does he?”\n“I think so.”\n“Why? Why do you think so?”\n“Because he says he wishes to create no more Face Dancers. He insists that his human stock, once it has been paired, breeds in the way it has always bred.”\n“What the hell does that have to do with it?”\n“You asked me what he believes in. | think he believes in chance. | think that’s his god.”\n“That’s superstition!”\n“Considering the circumstances of the Empire, a very daring superstition.”\nIdaho glared at Moneo. “You damned Atreides,” he muttered. “You'll dare anything!”\nMoneo noted that there was dislike mixed with admiration in Idaho’s voice.\nThe Duncans always begin that way.\nWhat is the most profound difference between us, between you and me? You already know it. It’s these ancestral memories. Mine come at me in the full glare of awareness. Yours work from your blind side. Some call it instinct or fate. The memories apply their leverages to each of us—on what we think and what we do. You think you are immune to such influences? | am Galileo. | stand here and tell you: “Yet it moves.” That which moves can exert its force in ways no mortal power ever before dared stem. | am here to dare this.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nll hen she was a child, she watched me, remember?\nWhen she thought I was not aware, Siona watched me like the desert hawk which circles above the lair of its prey. You yourself mentioned it.”\nLeto rolled his body a quarter turn on his cart while speaking. This brought his cowled face close to that of Moneo, who trotted beside the cart.\nIt was barely dawn on the desert road which followed the high artificial ridge from the Citadel in the Sareer to the Festival City. The road from the desert ran laser-beam straight until it reached this point where it curved widely and dipped into terraced canyons before crossing the Idaho River. The air was full of thick mists from the river tumbling in its distant clamor, but Leto had opened the bubble cover which sealed the front of his cart. The moisture made his worm-self tingle with vague distress, but there was the smell of sweet desert growth in the mist and his human nostrils savored it. He ordered the cortege to stop.\n“Why are we stopping, Lord?” Moneo asked.\nLeto did not answer. The cart creaked as he heaved his bulk into an arching curve which lifted his head and allowed him to look across the Forbidden Forest to the Kynes Sea\nglistening silver far off to the right. He turned left and there were the remains of the Shield Wall, a sinuous low shadow in the morning light. The ridge here had been raised almost two thousand meters to enclose the Sareer and limit airborne moisture there. From his vantage, Leto could see the distant notch where he had caused the Festival City of Onn to be built.\n“It is a whim which stops me,” Leto said.\n“Shouldn’t we cross the bridge before resting?” Moneo asked.\n“Lam not resting.”\nLeto stared ahead. After a series of switchbacks which were visible from here only as a twisting shadow, the high road crossed the river on a faery bridge, climbed to a buffer ridge and then sloped down to the city which presented a vista of glittering spires at this distance.\n“The Duncan acts subdued,” Leto said. “Have you had your long conversation with him?”\n“Precisely as you required, Lord.”\n“Well, it’s only been four days,” Leto said. “They often take longer to recover.”\n“He has been busy with your Guard, Lord. They were out until late again last night.”\n“The Duncans do not like to walk in the open. They think about the things which could be used to attack us.”\n“I know, Lord.”\nLeto turned and looked squarely at Moneo. The majordomo wore a green cloak over his white uniform. He stood beside the open bubble cover, exactly in the place where duty required that he station himself on these excursions.\n“You are very dutiful, Moneo,” Leto said.\n“Thank you, Lord.”\nGuards and courtiers kept themselves at a respectful distance well behind the cart. Most of them were trying to avoid even the appearance of eavesdropping on Leto and\nMoneo. Not so Idaho. He had positioned some of the Fish Speaker guards at both sides of the Royal Road, spreading them out. Now, he stood staring at the cart. Idaho wore a black uniform with white piping, a gift of the Fish Speakers, Moneo had said.\n“They like this one very much. He is good at what he does.”\n“What does he do, Moneo?”\n“Why, guard your person, Lord.”\nThe women of the Guard all wore skintight green uniforms, each with a red Atreides hawk at the left breast.\n“They watch him very closely,” Leto said.\n“Yes. He is teaching them hand signals. He says it’s the Atreides way.”\n“That is certainly correct. | wonder why the previous one didn’t do that?”\n“Lord, if you don’t know...”\n“Į jest, Moneo. The previous Duncan did not feel threatened until it was too late. Has this one accepted our explanations?”\n“So I’m told, Lord. He is well started in your service.”\n“Why is he carrying only that knife in the belt sheath?”\n“The women have convinced him that only the specially trained among them should have lasguns.”\n“Your caution is groundless, Moneo. Tell the women that it’s much too early for us to begin fearing this one.”\n“As my Lord commands.”\nIt was obvious to Leto that his new Guard Commander did not enjoy the presence of the courtiers. He stood well away from them. Most of the courtiers, he had been told, were civil functionaries. They were decked out in their brightest and finest for this day when they could parade themselves in their full power and in the presence of the God Emperor. Leto could see how foolish the courtiers must appear to Idaho. But Leto could remember far more foolish finery and\nhe thought that this day’s display might be an improvement.\n“Have you introduced him to Siona?” Leto asked.\nAt the mention of Siona, Moneo’s brows congealed into a scowl.\n“Calm yourself,” Leto said. “Even when she spied on me, | cherished her.”\n“I sense danger in her, Lord. | think sometimes she sees into my most secret thoughts.”\n“The wise child knows her father.”\n“I do not joke, Lord.”\n“Yes, | can see that. Have you noticed that the Duncan grows impatient?”\n“They scouted the road almost to the bridge,” Moneo said.\n“What did they find?”\n“The same thing | found—a new Museum Fremen.”\n“Another petition?”\n“Do not be angry, Lord.”\nOnce more, Leto peered ahead. This necessary exposure to the open air, the long and stately journey with all of its ritual requirements to reassure the Fish Speakers, all of it troubled Leto. And now, another petition!\nIdaho strode forward to stop directly behind Moneo.\nThere was a sense of menace about Idaho’s movements. Surely not this soon, Leto thought.\n“Why are we stopping, m’Lord?” Idaho asked.\n“| often stop here,” Leto said.\nIt was true. He turned and looked beyond the faery bridge. The way twisted downward out of the canyon heights into the Forbidden Forest and thence through fields beside the river. Leto had often stopped here to watch the sunrise. There was something about this morning, though, the sun striking across the familiar vista .. . something which stirred old memories.\nThe fields of the Royal Plantations reached outward beyond the forest and, when the sun lifted over the far curve of land, it beamed glowing gold across grain rippling in the fields. The grain reminded Leto of sand, of sweeping dunes which once had marched across this very ground.\nAnd will march once more.\nThe grain was not quite the bright silica amber of his remembered desert. Leto looked back at the cliff-enclosed distances of his Sareer, his sanctuary of the past. The colors were distinctly different. All the same, when he looked once more toward the Festival City, he felt an ache where his many hearts once more were reforming in their slow transformation toward something profoundly alien.\nWhat is it about this morning that makes me think about my lost humanity? Leto wondered.\nOf all the Royal party looking at that familiar scene of grain fields and forest, Leto knew that only he still thought of the lush landscape as the bahr bela ma, the ocean without water.\n“Duncan,” Leto said. “You see that out\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a05c38f299aa1c442d5a4c064a8cf821b456dfba5ccf28592bbb71c96c627c18_v2"}
