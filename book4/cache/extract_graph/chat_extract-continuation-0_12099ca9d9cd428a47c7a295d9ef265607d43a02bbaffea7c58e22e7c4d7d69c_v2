\n　　“他同意了，其他人为难一些，但不会反对！”曹书记权威地说。“只是土地怕一时不好给你分，城边上地缺。不过，先把户口安下再说！长远你不要怕！你先可以象现在一样在城里揽活做……当然，只能落你一个人的户口，家里其他人恐怕不行。” \n　　少平想，只要他先能落下户口，以后慢慢再说，山不转水转，他把根扎牢了。到时其它事说不定都可以解决……他对书记说：“叔叔，能行！就按你说的来！我乐意到阳沟村落户。有你和婶子，我一切方面都放心着哩！”“那好，你要是不忙，现在就跟我去一趟阳沟，我给你想办法开准迁证。”曹书记看来非常热心给他帮这个忙。少平想了想，觉得这事太突然，他需要再细考虑一下，于是就对曹书记说：“我现在要到东关去办点事，过两天我一定去你们家！” \n　　“那也好！我回去把事都弄妥当，你什么时间来都可以拿手续！” \n　　曹书记和他很热情地握了手，就告辞走了。 \n　　少平立在原地方半天没挪动脚步，他怎么也反应不过来这件突然冒出的事。曹书记怎对他这个揽工小子关怀到这种程度呢？ \n　　其实，曹书记有曹书记的打算。 \n　　阳沟的这个精能人只生了两个女儿。他的大女儿菊英已经十八岁，但念不进去书，一直在初中留上一级再留一级；看来只能勉强初中毕业，高中的门是进不去了。少平在他家做活的时候，他老两口一下子就看中了这娃娃。少平离开后，他们商量，想叫这后生将来和他们的菊英成亲。做个上门女婿。他们没生养儿子，有个女婿在身边，老人就有人照顾了。因此，多少天来，曹书记跑着在各处的工地上打问他未来的“女婿”，却想不到今天无意中在街上碰见了孙少平……少平对这一切当然毫无所知。他现在立在黄原河桥头，只是对曹书记的一片好心充满了感激。他真想不到生活中出现了这样的转机。他想，这大概就是人们所说的“命运”吧？ \n　　现在，这个突然被命运之神宠爱的青年，怀着激动的心情走过了黄原河大桥，去找他的朋友金波。路过东关桥头的时候，他不由瞥了一眼他那个亲切的“王国”——那里永远躺着、坐着、站着许许多多等待劳动机会的同伴……他在邮政局找到金波，还没来得及说他的高兴事，金波就给他拿出了一封家信，说：“我父亲前几天就捎来了。我到处打问找不见你。你快拆开看看！是不是家里有什么紧事……” \n　　少平认出信封上是二爸的字体。他的手忍不住微微发着抖，拆开了那封信——他们家的信大概不会给他带来什么好消息\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CAO SECRETARY<|>PERSON<|>The Cao Secretary
