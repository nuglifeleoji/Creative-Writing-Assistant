\n　　决不能松劲！他还应该象往常一样，精神抖擞地跳上这辆生活的马车，坐在驾辕的位置上，绷紧全身的肌肉和神经，吆喝着，呐喊着，继续走向前去……孙少安迅速地卷起了一支旱烟卷。 \n　　他鼻子口里喷着烟雾，扯开脚步匆匆地向他的砖厂走去；他远远地看见，头上拢着白羊肚子毛巾的妻子，已经立在一堵蓝色的砖墙旁等待他了。 \n                  第42章\n　　痛苦难道是白忍受的吗？ \n　　托马斯·曼爱情在不知不觉中产生了。什么时候开始的？连他们自己也不知道。一般而论，这件事对他们为说，出现得是有点过早了，因为他们都才十九岁。不过，仔细一想，也有情可原。可为他们一同出生在高家村，从光屁股一块玩到懂得害羞的年龄，一起背着书包上村小学，又一起背着铺盖卷进城上中学，直到眼下高中毕业，并且报考了同样的大学和专业。现在他们正处在一种焦躁不安的等待中。十几下抽的朝夕相处，加上这几年洪水一样的爱情电影的熏陶，少男少女心灵中那根神秘的琴弦终于被拨动了，并且弹出了第二组不那熟练的、然而是异常美妙的和音。 \n　　大年是前村高仁山二小子。他和他那老实巴结父亲一样，带着一身淳朴的、倔强的憨气，就像黄土里长出来的一株高粱。当然，这种人往往有一种别人很难比得上的品质，那就是非常有耐力，能经受得住摔打。这一点也像田野里的高粱。如果各位有机会大旱之上，到中国北部的山地里一走，就会看见，当许多植物被烈日烤晒得蔫头聋脑时，吸有高粱却倔强地挺着它的腰杆，并且会在秋后捧出一穗红艳艳的颗粒来。 \n　　就说大年的父亲高仁山吧，虽然岁数已经不小，但硬是一个人强撑着，用辛勤的汗水供两个小子上学，非让他们求得“功名”不可，大小子前年考大学名落孙山，已经收心务农了。可他并不灰心，继续向乡亲们发誓，要把他的大年送进大学门。大年这孩子虽然并不特别聪敏，倒也像他父亲一样的股牛劲，靠着勤奋，学习一直也还是很出众的。 \n　　小丽却是另外一种孩子，聪明、伶俐，活泼得像一只小山羊。她虽然也是土生土长的农村娃，但非常富于幻想。就说她和大年爱情（姑且这么说吧），也是她首先主动表示的，并且有一次在星期六回村路上，还逗得大年电影里那些恋爱的人那样，在后面追着她跑。她呢，一边跑，一边嘻嘻哈哈地表演了一些淘气的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
