children of our flesh? No. But the effects of this union will be profound.”\n“I listened while you were talking to Moneo,” Idaho said. “I thought it must be some kind of joke,a.. .”\n“Careful, Duncan!”\n“Do you Jove her?”\n“More deeply than any man ever loved a woman.”\n“Well, what about her? Does she...”\n“She feels ... a compelling compassion, a need to share with me, to give whatever she can give. It is her nature.”\nIdaho suppressed a feeling of revulsion.\n“Moneo’s right. They'll believe the Tleilaxu stories.”\n“That is one of the profound effects.”\n“And you still want me to... to mate with Siona!”\n“You know my wishes. | leave the choice to you.”\n“Who's that Nayla woman?”\n“You've met Nayla! Good.”\n“She and Siona act like sisters. That big hunk! What’s going on there, Leto?”\n“What would you want to go on? And what does it matter?”\n“I’ve never met such a brute! She reminds me of Beast Rabban. You’d never know she was female if she didn’t...”\n“You have met her before,” Leto said. “You knew her as Friend.”\nIdaho stared at him in quick silence, the silence of a burrowing creature who senses the hawk.\n“Then you trust her,” Idaho said.\n“Trust? What is trust?”\nThe moment arrives, Leto thought. He could see it Shaping in Idaho’s thoughts.\n“Trust is what goes with a pledge of loyalty,” Idaho said.\n“Such as the trust between you and me?” Leto asked.\nA bitter smile touched Idaho’s lips. “So that’s what you’re doing with Hwi Noree? A marriage, a pledge...”\n“Hwi and | already have trust for each other.”\n“Do you trust me, Leto?”\n“If | cannot trust Duncan Idaho, | cannot trust anyone.”\n“And if | can’t trust you?”\n“Then | pity you.”\nIdaho took this as almost a physical shock. His eyes were wide with unspoken demands. He wanted to trust. He wanted the magic which would never come again.\nIdaho indicated his thoughts were taking off in an odd tangent then.\n“Can they hear us out in the anteroom?” he asked.\n“No.” But my journals hear!\n“Moneo was furious. Anyone could see it. But he went away like a docile lamb.”\n“Moneo is an aristocrat. He is married to duty, to responsibilities. When he is reminded of these things, his anger vanishes.”\n“So that’s how you control him,” Idaho said.\n“He controls himself,” Leto said, remembering how Moneo had glanced up from the notetaking, not for reassurances, but to prompt his sense of duty.\n“No,” Idaho said. “He doesn’t control himself. You do it.”\n“Moneo has locked himse/f into his past. | did not do that.”\n“But he’s an aristocrat... an Atreides.”\nLeto recalled Moneo’s aging features, thinking how inevitable it was that the aristocrat would refuse his final duty—which was to step aside and vanish into history. He would have to be driven aside. And he would be. No aristocrat had ever overcome the demands of change.\nIdaho was not through. “Are you an aristocrat, Leto?”\nLeto smiled. “The ultimate aristocrat dies within me.” And he thought: Privilege becomes arrogance. Arrogance promotes injustice. The seeds of ruin blossom.\n“Maybe I will not attend your wedding,” Idaho said. “I never thought of myself as an aristocrat.”\n“But you were. You were the aristocrat of the sword.”\n“Paul was better,” Idaho said.\nLeto spoke in the voice of Muad’Dib: “Because you taught me!” He resumed his normal tones: “The aristocrat’s unspoken duty—to teach, and sometimes by horrible example.”\nAnd he thought: Pride of birth trails out into penury and the weaknesses of interbreeding. The way is opened for pride of wealth and accomplishment. Enter the nouveaux riches, riding to power as the Harkonnens did, on the backs of the ancient régime.\nThe cycle repeated itself with such persistence that Leto felt anyone should have seen how it must be built into long forgotten survival patterns which the species had outgrown, but never lost.\nBut no, we still carry the detritus which | must weed out.\n“Is there some frontier?” Idaho asked. “Is there some frontier where | could go and never again be a part of this?”\n“If there is to be any frontier, you must help me create it,” Leto said. “There is now no place to go where others of us cannot follow and find you.”\n“Then you won't let me go.”\n“Go if you wish. Others of you have tried it. | tell you there is no frontier, no place to hide. Right now, as it has been for a long, long time, humankind is like a single-celled creature, bound together by a dangerous glue.”\n“No new planets? No strange...”\n“Oh, we grow, but we do not separate.”\n“Because you hold us together!” he accused.\n“| do not know if you can understand this, Duncan, but if there is a frontier, any kind of frontier, then what lies behind you cannot be more important than what lies ahead.”\n“You're the past!”\n“No, Moneo is the past. He is quick to raise the traditional aristocratic barriers against all frontiers. You must understand the power of those barriers. They not only enclose planets and land on those planets, they enclose ideas. They repress change.”\n“You repress change!”\nHe will not deviate, Leto thought. One more try.\n“The surest sign that an aristocracy exists is the discovery of barriers against change, curtains of iron or steel or stone or of any substance which excludes the new, the different.”\n“I know there must be a frontier somewhere,” Idaho said. “You're hiding it.”\n“I hide nothing of frontiers. | want frontiers! | want Surprises!”\nThey come right up against it, Leto thought. Then they refuse to enter.\nTrue to this prediction, Idaho’s thoughts darted off ona new tack. “Did you really have Face Dancers perform at your betrothal?”\nLeto felt a surge of anger, followed immediately by a wry enjoyment of the fact that he could experience the emotion in such depth. He wanted to let it shout at Duncan... but that would solve nothing.\n“The Face Dancers performed,” he said.\n“Why?”\n“I want everyone to share in my happiness.”\nIdaho stared at him as though just discovering a repellent insect in his drink. In a flat voice, Idaho said: “That is the most cynical thing | have ever heard an Atreides say.”\n“But an Atreides said it.”\n“You're deliberately trying to put me off! You’re avoiding my question.”\nOnce more into the fray, Leto thought. He said: “The Face Dancers of the Bene Tleilax are a colony organism. Individually, they are mules. This is a choice they made for and by themselves.”\nLeto waited, thinking: / must be patient. They have to discover it for themselves. If I say it, they will not believe. Think, Duncan. Think!\nAfter a long silence, Idaho said: “I have given you my oath. That is important to me. It is still important. | don’t know what you’re doing or why. | can only say | don’t like what’s happening. There! I’ve said it.”\n“Is that why you returned from the Citadel?”\n“Yes!”\n“Will you go back to the Citadel now?”\n“What other frontier is there?”\n“Very good, Duncan! Your anger knows even when your reason does not. Hwi goes to the Citadel tonight. | will join her there tomorrow.”\n“I want to get to know her better,” Idaho said.\n“You will avoid her,” Leto said. “That is an order. Hwi is not for you.”\n“I’ve always known there were witches,” Idaho said. “Your grandmother was one.”\nHe turned on his heel and, not asking leave, strode back the way he had come.\nHow like a little boy he is, Leto thought, watching the stiffness in Idaho’s back. The oldest man in our universe and the youngest—both in one flesh.\nThe prophet is not diverted by illusions of past, present and future. The fixity of language determines such linear distinctions. Prophets hold a key to the lock in a language. The mechanical image remains only an image to them. This is not a mechanical universe. The linear progression of events is imposed by the observer. Cause and effect? That’s not it at all. The prophet utters fateful words. You glimpse a thing “destined to occur.” But the prophetic instant releases something of infinite portent and power. The universe undergoes a ghostly shift. Thus, the wise prophet conceals actuality behind shimmering labels. The uninitiated then believe the prophetic language is ambiguous. The listener distrusts the prophetic messenger. Instinct tells you how the utterance blunts the power of such words. The best prophets lead you up to the curtain and let you peer through for yourself.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nBe addressed Moneo in the coldest voice he had ever used: “The Duncan disobeys me.”\nThey were in the airy room of golden stone atop the Citadel’s south tower, Leto’s third full day back from the Decennial Festival in Onn. An open portal beside him looked out over the harsh noonday of the Sareer. The wind made a deep humming sound through the opening. It stirred up dust and sand which made Moneo squint. Leto seemed not to notice the irritation. He stared out across the Sareer, where the air was alive with heat movements. The distant flow of dunes suggested a mobility in the landscape which only his eyes observed.\nMoneo stood immersed in the sour odors of his own fear, knowing that the wind conveyed the message of these odors to Leto’s senses. The arrangements for the wedding, the upset among the Fish Speakers—everything was paradox. It reminded Moneo of something the God Emperor had said in the first days of their association.\n“Paradox is a pointer telling you to look beyond it. If paradoxes bother you, that betrays your deep desire for absolutes. The relativist treats a paradox merely as interesting, perhaps amusing or even, dreadful thought, educational.”\n“You do not respond,” Leto said. He turned from his examination of the Sareer and focused the weight of his attention on Moneo.\nMoneo could only shrug. How near is the Worm? he wondered. Moneo had noticed that the return to the Citadel from Onn sometimes aroused the Worm. No sign of that awful shift in the God Emperor’s presence had yet betrayed itself, but Moneo sensed it. Could the Worm come without warning?\n“Accelerate arrangements for the wedding,” Leto said. “Make it as soon as possible.”\n“Before you test Siona?”\nLeto was silent fora moment, then: “No. What will you do about the Duncan?”\n“What would you have me do, Lord?”\n“I told him not to see Noree, to avoid her. | told him it was an order.”\n“She has sympathy for him, Lord. Nothing more.”\n“Why would she have sympathy for him?”\n“He is a ghola. He has no connection to our times, no", " the Sareer and focused the weight of his attention on Moneo.\nMoneo could only shrug.

He has no connection to our times, no roots.”\n“He has roots as deep as mine!”\n“But he does not know this, Lord.”\n“Are you arguing with me, Moneo?”\nMoneo backed away a half step, knowing that this did not remove him from danger. “Oh, no, Lord. But | always try to tell you truly what I believe is happening.”\n“I will tell you what is happening. He is courting her.”\n“But she initiates their meetings, Lord.”\n“Then you knew about this!”\n“I did not know you had absolutely prohibited it, Lord.”\nLeto spoke in a musing voice: “He is clever with women, Moneo, exceedingly clever. He sees into their souls and makes them do what he wants. It has always been that way with the Duncans.”\n“I did not know you had prohibited all meetings between them, Lord!” Moneo’s voice was almost strident.\n“He is more dangerous than any of the others,” Leto said. “It is the fault of our times.”\n“Lord, the Tleilaxu do not have a successor for him ready to deliver.”\n“And we need this one?”\n“You said it yourself, Lord. It is a paradox which | do not understand, but you did say it.”\n“How long until there could be a replacement?”\n“At least a year, Lord. Shall | inquire as to a specific date?”\n“Do it today.”\n“He may hear about it, Lord. The previous one did.”\n“I do not want it to happen this way, Moneo!”\n“I know, Lord.”\n“And | dare not speak of this to Noree,” Leto said. “The Duncan is not for her. Yet, | cannot hurt her!” This last was almost a wail.\nMoneo stood in awed silence.\n“Can't you see this?” Leto demanded. “Moneo, help me.”\n“I see that it is different with Noree,” Moneo said. “But | do not know what to do.”\n“What is different?” Leto’s voice had a penetrating quality which cut right through Moneo.\n“I mean your attitude toward her, Lord. It is different from anything | have ever seen in you.”\nMoneo noted then the first signs—twitching in the God Emperor’s hands, the beginning glaze in the eyes. Gods! The Worm is coming! Moneo felt totally exposed. A simple flick of the great body would crush Moneo against a wall. / must appeal to the human in him.\n“Lord,” Moneo said, “I have read the accounts and heard your own words about your marriage to your sister, Ghanima.”\n“If only she were with me now,” Leto said.\n“She was never your mate, Lord.”\n“What're you suggesting?” Leto demanded.\nThe twitching of Leto’s hands had become a spasmodic vibration.\n“She was... I mean, Lord, that Ghanima was Harq al- Ada’s mate.”\n“Of course she was! All of you Atreides are descended from them!”\n“Is there something you have not told me, Lord? Is it possible... that is, with Hwi Noree .. . could you mate?”\nLeto’s hands shook so strongly Moneo wondered that their owner did not know it. The glazing of the great blue eyes deepened.\nMoneo backed another step toward the door to the stairs leading down from this deadly place.\n“Do not question me about possibilities,” Leto said, and his voice was hideously distant, gone somewhere into the layers of his past.\n“Never again, Lord,” Moneo said. He bowed himself back to only a single pace from the door. “I will speak to Noree, Lord... and to the Duncan.”\n“Do what you can.” Leto’s voice was far away in those interior chambers which only he could enter.\nSoftly, Moneo let himself out of the door. He closed it behind him and placed his back against it, trembling. Ahhh, that was the closest ever.\nAnd the paradox remained. Where did it point? What was the meaning of the God Emperor’s odd and painful decisions? What had brought The Worm Who Is God?\nA thumping sounded from within Leto’s aerie, a heavy beating against stone. Moneo dared not open the door to investigate. He pushed himself away from the surface which\nreflected that dreadful thumping and went down the stairs, moving cautiously, not drawing an easy breath until he reached ground level and the Fish Speaker guard there.\n“Is he disturbed?” she asked, looking up the stairs.\nMoneo nodded. They both could hear the thumping quite plainly.\n“What disturbs him?” the guard asked.\n“He is God and we are mortal,” Moneo said. This was an answer which usually satisfied Fish Speakers, but new forces were at work now.\nShe looked directly at him and Moneo saw the killer training close to the surface of her soft features. She was a relatively young woman with auburn hair and a face usually dominated by a turned-up nose and full lips, but now her eyes were hard and demanding. Only a fool would turn his back on those eyes.\n“| did not disturb him,” Moneo said.\n“Of course not,” she agreed. Her look softened slightly. “But | would like to know who or what did.”\n“I think he is impatient for his marriage,” Moneo said. “I think that’s all it is.”\n“Then hurry the day!” she said.\n“That’s what I’m about,” Moneo said. He turned and hurried away down the long hall to his own area of the Citadel. Gods! The Fish Speakers were becoming as dangerous as the God Emperor.\nThat stupid Duncan! He puts us all in peril. And Hwi Noree! What’s to be done about her?\nThe pattern of monarchies and similar systems has a message of value for all political forms. My memories assure me that governments of any kind could profit from this message. Governments can be useful to the governed only so long as inherent tendencies toward tyranny are restrained. Monarchies have some good features beyond their star qualities. They can reduce the size and parasitic nature of the management bureaucracy. They can make speedy decisions when necessary. They fit an ancient human demand for a parental (tribal/feudal) hierarchy where every person knows his place. It is valuable to know your place, even if that place is temporary. It is galling to be held in place against your will. This is why | teach about tyranny in the best possible way—by example. Even though you read these words after a passage of eons, my tyranny will not be forgotten. My Golden Path assures this. Knowing my message, | expect you to be exceedingly careful about the powers you delegate to any government.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nBe prepared with patient care for his first private meeting with Siona since her childhood banishment to the Fish Speaker schools in the Festival City. He told Moneo that he would see her at the Little Citadel, a vantage tower he had built in the central Sareer. The site had been chosen to provide views of old and new and places between. There were no roads to the Little Citadel. Visitors arrived by ‘thopter. Leto went there as though by magic.\nWith his own hands, in the early days of his ascendancy, Leto has used an Ixian machine to dig a secret tunnel under the Sareer to his tower, doing all of the work himself. In those days, a few wild sandworms still roamed the desert. He had lined his tunnel with massive walls of fused silica and had imbedded countless bubbles of worm-repelling water in the outer layers. The tunnel anticipated his maximum growth and the requirements of a Royal Cart which, at that time, had been only a figment of his visions.\nIn the early predawn hours of the day assigned to Siona, Leto descended to the crypt and gave orders to his guard that he was not to be disturbed by anyone. His cart sped him down one of the crypt’s dark spokes where he opened a hidden portal, emerging in less than an hour at the Little Citadel.\nOne of his delights was to go out alone onto the sand. No cart. Only his pre-worm body to carry him. The sand felt luxuriously sensuous against him. The heat of his passage through the dunes in the day’s first light sent up a wake of steam which required him to keep moving. He brought himself to a stop only when he found a relatively dry pocket about five kilometers out. He lay there at the center of an uncomfortable dampness from the trace-dew, his body just outside the long shadow of the tower which stretched eastward from him across the dunes.\nFrom a distance, the three thousand meters of the tower could be seen as an impossible needle stabbing the sky. Only the inspired blend of Leto’s commands and Ixian imagination made the structure conceivable. One hundred and fifty meters in diameter, the tower sat on a foundation which plunged as deeply under the sand as it climbed above. The magic of plasteel and superlight alloys kept it supple in the wind and resistant to sandblast abrasions.\nLeto enjoyed the place so much that he rationed his visits, making up a long list of personal rules which had to be met. The rules added up to “Great Necessity.”\nFor a few moments while he lay there, he could shed the loads of the Golden Path. Moneo, good and reliable Moneo, would see that Siona arrived promptly, just at nightfall. Leto had a full day in which to relax and think, to play and pretend that he possessed no cares, to drink up the raw sustenance of the earth in a feeding frenzy which he could never indulge in at Onn or at the Citadel. In those places, he was required to confine himself to furtive burrowings through narrow passages where only prescient caution kept\nhim from encountering water-pockets. Here, though, he could race through the sand and across it, feed and grow strong.\nSand crunched beneath him as he rolled, flexing his body in pure animal enjoyment. He could feel his worm-self being restored, an electric sensation which sent messages of health all through him.\nThe sun was well above the horizon now, painting a golden line up the side of the tower. There was the smell of bitter dust in the air and an odor of distant spiny plants which had responded to the morning’s trace-dew. Gently at first, then more rapidly, he moved out in a wide circle around the tower, thinking about Siona as he went.\nThere could be no more delays. She had to be tested. Moneo knew this as well as Leto did.\nJust that morning, Moneo had said: “Lord, there is terrible violence in her.”\n“She has the beginnings of adrenalin addiction,” Leto had said. “It’s cold-tur", ", though, he could race through the sand and across it, feed and grow strong.\nSand crunched beneath him as he rolled, flexing his body in pure animal enjoyment.

It means she must be subjected to a complete withdrawal. She must go through a necessity-shock.”\n“Oh... | See.”\nFor once, Leto realized, Moneo did see. Moneo had gone through his own cold-turkey time.\n“The young generally are incapable of making hard decisions unless those decisions are associated with immediate violence and the consequent sharp flow of adrenalin,” Leto had explained.\nMoneo had held himself in reflexive silence, remembering, then: “It is a great peril.”\n“That’s the violence you see in Siona. Even old people can cling to it, but the young wallow in it.”\nAs he circled his tower in the growing light of the day, enjoying the feel of the sand even more as it dried, Leto\nthought about the conversation. He slowed his passage over the sand. A wind from behind him carried the vented oxygen and a burnt-flint smell over his human nostrils. He inhaled deeply, lifting his magnified awareness to a new level.\nThis preliminary day contained a multiple purpose. He thought of the coming encounter much as an ancient bullfighter had thought about the first examination of a horned adversary. Siona possessed her own version of horns, although Moneo would make certain that she brought no physical weapons to this encounter. Leto had to be sure, though, that he knew Siona’s every strength and every weakness. And he would have to create special susceptibilities in her wherever possible. She had to be prepared for the test, her psychic muscles blunted by well- planted barbs.\nShortly after noon, his worm-self satiated, Leto returned to the tower, crawled back onto his cart and lifted on suspensors to the very tip of a portal there which opened only at his command. Throughout the rest of the day, he lay there in the aerie, thinking, plotting.\nThe fluttering wings of an ornithopter whispered on the air just at nightfall to signal Moneo’s arrival.\nFaithful Moneo.\nLeto caused a landing-lip to extrude from his aerie. The ‘thopter glided in, its wings cupped. It settled gently onto the lip. Leto stared out through the gathering darkness. Siona emerged and darted in toward him, fearful of the unprotected height. She wore a white robe over a black uniform without insignia. She stole one look backward when she stopped just inside the tower, then she turned her attention to Leto’s bulk waiting on the cart almost at the center of the aerie. The ‘thopter lifted away and jetted off into the darkness. Leto left the lip extruded, the portal open.\n“There is a balcony on the other side of the tower,” he said. “We will go there.”\n“Why?”\nSiona’s voice carried almost pure suspicion.\n“I’m told it’s a cool place,” Leto said. “And there is indeed a faint sensation of cold on my cheeks when I expose them to the breeze there.”\nCuriosity brought her closer to him.\nLeto closed the portal behind her.\n“The night view from the balcony is magnificent,” Leto said.\n“Why are we here?”\n“Because here we will not be overheard.”\nLeto turned his cart and moved it silently out to the balcony. The faintest of hidden illumination within the aerie showed her his movement. He heard her follow.\nThe balcony was a half-ring on the southeast arc of the tower, a lacy railing at chest-height around the perimeter. Siona moved to the rail and swept her gaze around the open land.\nLeto sensed the waiting receptivity. Something was to be spoken here for her ears alone. Whatever it was, she would listen and respond from the well of her own motives. Leto looked across her toward the edge of the Sareer where the man-made boundary wall was a low flat line just barely visible in the light of First Moon lifting above the horizon. His amplified vision identified the distant movement of a convoy from Onn, a dull glow of lights from the beast-drawn vehicles pacing along the high road toward Tabur Village.\nHe could call up a memory-image of the village nestled among the plants which grew in the moist area along the inner base of the wall. His Museum Fremen tended date palms, tall grasses and even truck gardens there. It was not like the old days when any inhabited place, even a tiny basin with a few low plants fed by a single cistern and windtrap, could appear lush by comparison with the open sand. Tabur Village was a water-rich paradise when compared with Sietch Tabr. Everyone in today’s village knew that just beyond the Sareer’s boundary wall the Idaho River\nslid southward in a long straight line which would be silver now in the moonlight. Museum Fremen could not climb the wall’s sheer inner face, but they knew the water was there. The earth knew, too. If a Tabur inhabitant put an ear against the ground, the earth spoke with the sound of distant rapids.\nThere would be nightbirds along the bankment now, Leto thought, creatures which would live in sunlight on another world. Dune had worked its evolutionary magic on them and they still lived at the mercies of the Sareer. Leto had seen the birds draw dumb shadows across the water and, when they dipped to drink, there were ripples which the river took away.\nEven at this distance, Leto sensed a power in that faraway water, something forceful out of his past which moved away from him like the current slipping southward into the reaches of farm and forest. The water searched through rolling hills, along the margins of an abundant plantlife which had replaced all of Dune’s desert except for this one last place, this Sareer, this sanctuary of the past.\nLeto recalled the growling thrust of Ixian machines which had inflicted that watercourse upon the landscape. It seemed such a short time ago, little more than three thousand years.\nSiona stirred and looked back at him, but Leto remained silent, his attention fixed beyond her. A pale amber light shone above the horizon, reflection of a town on faraway clouds. From its direction and distance, Leto knew it to be the town of Wallport transplanted far into a warmer clime of the south from its once-austere location in the cold, low- Slanted light of the north. The glow of the town was like a window into his past. He felt the beam of it striking through to his breast, straight through the thick and scaled membrane which had replaced his human skin.\nl am vulnerable, he thought.\nYet, he knew himself to be the master of this place. And the planet was the master of him.\nlam part of it.\nHe devoured the soil directly, rejecting only the water. His human mouth and lungs had been relegated to breathing just enough to sustain a remnant humanity .. . and talking.\nLeto spoke to Siona’s back: “I like to talk and | dread the day when I no longer will be able to engage in conversations.”\nWith a certain diffidence, she turned and stared at him in the moonlight, quite obvious distaste in her expression.\n“| agree that | am a monster in many human eyes,” he said.\n“Why am | here?”\nDirectly to the point! She would not deviate. Most of the Atreides had been that way, he thought. It was a characteristic which he hoped to maintain in the breeding of them. It spoke of a strong inner sense of identity.\n“| need to find out what Time has done to you,” he said.\n“Why do you need that?”\nA little fear in her voice there, he thought. She thinks I will probe after her puny rebellion and the names of her surviving associates.\nWhen he remained silent, she said: “Do you intend to kill me the way you killed my friends?”\nSo she has heard about the fight at the Embassy. And she assumes | know all about her past rebellious activities. Moneo has been lecturing her, damn him! Well... | might have done the same in his circumstances.\n“Are you really a god?” she demanded. “I don’t understand why my father believes that.”\nShe has some doubts, he thought. / still have room to maneuver.\n“Definitions vary,” he said. “To Moneo, l am a god... and that is a truth.”\n“You were human once.”\nHe began to enjoy the leaps of her intellect. She had that sure, hunting curiosity which was the hallmark of the Atreides.\n“You are curious about me,” he said. “It is the same with me. | am curious about you.”\n“What makes you think I’m curious?”\n“You used to watch me very carefully when you were a child. | see that same look in your eyes tonight.”\n“Yes, | have wondered what it’s like to be you.”\nHe studied her for a moment. The moonlight drew Shadows under her eyes, concealing them. He could let himself imagine that her eyes were the total blue of his own eyes, the blue of spice addiction. With that imaginative addition, Siona bore a curious resemblance to his long-dead Ghani. It was in the outline of her face and the placement of the eyes. He almost told Siona this, then thought better of it.\n“Do you eat human food?” Siona asked.\n“For a long time after | put on the sandtrout skin, | felt stomach hunger,” he said. “Occasionally, | would attempt food. My stomach mostly rejected it. The cilia of the Sandtrout spread almost everywhere in my human flesh. Eating became a bothersome thing. These days, | only ingest dry substances which sometimes contain a bit of the Spice.”\n“You... eat melange?”\n“Sometimes.”\n“But you no longer have human hungers?”\n“| didn’t say that.”\nShe stared at him, waiting.\nLeto admired the way she let unspoken questions work for her. She was bright and she had learned much during her short life.\n“The stomach hunger was a black feeling, a pain | could not relieve,” he said. “I would run then, run like an insane creature across the dunes.”\n“You... ran?”\n“My legs were longer in proportion to my body in those days. | could move myself about quite easily. But the hungry pain has never left me. | think it’s hunger for my lost humanity.”\nHe saw the beginnings of reluctant sympathy in her, the questioning.\n“You still have this... pain?”\n“It’s only a soft burning now. That’s one of the signs of my final metamorphosis. In a few hundred years, l'Il be back under the sand.”\nHe saw her clench her fists at her sides. “Why?” she demanded. “Why did you do this?”\n“This change isn’t all bad. Today, for example, has been very pleasant. | feel quite mellow.”\n“There are changes"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_a5627ba65877c3b87b1308e77543edac195b9bcd94bfac3dada17ca0f2dc3c3b_v2"}
