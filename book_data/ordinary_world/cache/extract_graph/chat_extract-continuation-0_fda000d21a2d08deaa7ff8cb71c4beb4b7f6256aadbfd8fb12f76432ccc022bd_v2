房间里拉出一些椅子来，给每一张圆桌前又加了一把，立刻就把问题解决了。李登云看见了，马上松了一口气，心里说，这小伙子脑子就是好！倒说田福军那么器重地。本来，他对田福军喜欢的人向来不感冒，现在却对白明川有了好看法——不管他其它方面怎样，但今天他为我李登云解了围。好小伙子！ \n　　白明川和几个人给每个圆桌旁加了一把椅子后，迎面碰上了柳岔公社主任周文龙。文龙虽然和他是高中时的同班同学，但文革初期，文龙是造反派，他是保守派，两个人一直很对立。后来他们参加了工作，现在又都成了公社主任，因此面子上还能过得去。两个人在走道里寒喧了几句，互相邀请对方到自己的公社来转转，然后就各坐在各的桌子上去了。徐国强和一群老干部挤在一桌上。他们吃不成硬东西，只是喝茶抽烟，说过去的一些事情。当老中医顾健翎到来时，医院领导刘志英亲自扶着他，也来到了这桌上。老干部们都纷纷站起来，迎接这个经常给他们看病的老神仙。他们立刻不再拉谈过去的事情，争抢着和顾老先生讨论各自的身体和疾病。 \n　　田福堂此时正一个人拘谨地坐在主宾席上。主宾席安排新郎新娘的双亲和县上的领导坐。领导按惯例总是最后出场，因此都还没到；登云两口子又在门口迎宾客；田福堂只好一个人干坐在这里。润叶姐也没来，说她“狗肉上不了筵席”，让丈夫一人来参加就行了。本来徐国强也安排在这桌上，但老汉为红火，撵到老干部席上去了。 \n　　田福堂现在，一个人坐在这地方真不自在。他气管不好，也不能吸烟；而这种场所又不能拿根纸烟凑到鼻子上闻——这太不雅观了。他只好两只手互相搓着，有点自卑地罗着腰，看着一桌桌说说笑笑的县社干部们。在这样的场所，双水村这个有魄力的领导人，马上变成了一个没有见识的乡巴佬。不过，福堂此刻内心里也充满了说不出的骄傲和荣耀。是呀，看这场面！真是气派！他感叹地想：他，一个农民，能这么荣耀地和县上的领导攀亲，真是做梦也想不到。他更为自己的女儿高兴——出嫁到这样的人家，那真是她娃娃的福份！ \n　　田福堂明显地感到自己的腰杆子更硬了。他弟弟是县上的副主任，现在，他又有了个副主任亲家！ \n　　田福堂正一个人在主宾席上又自卑又荣耀地坐着，他儿子润生忽然走过来，在他耳朵边悄悄说：“爸，咱村的少平叫你到外面来一下。” \n　　“\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
