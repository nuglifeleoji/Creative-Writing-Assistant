These enormous beings are drawn to rhythmic vibrations on the desert sands, making them both a constant threat and a vital part of life on Arrakis.  \n\nThe sandworm's life cycle is deeply intertwined with the planet's environment. Upon its death, the sandworm decomposes into **sandtrout**, which subsequently contribute to the expansion of Arrakis' deserts. This transformation underscores the creature's ecological significance, as it sustains the harsh, arid conditions necessary for spice production.  \n\nCentral to the planet's economy and culture, the sandworm is revered and feared in equal measure. Its presence ensures the continued existence of the spice, a resource of immense political and economic importance across the universe.
