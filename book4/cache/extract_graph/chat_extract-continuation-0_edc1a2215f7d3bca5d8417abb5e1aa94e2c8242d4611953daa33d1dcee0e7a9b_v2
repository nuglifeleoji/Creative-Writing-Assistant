生冬闲了就在村里办冬学，教穷人家娃娃识字。我也跟你爸学过字，可头一天学了，第二天就忘得一干二净。天生的不是个念书人嘛……” \n　　田福堂说着，就仰起头笑了。 \n　　金俊武在煤油灯上点着了书记刚才又递上的那支烟，也笑了，说：“我弟兄三个也一样。我歪好还跟上他识了几个字，我哥和我弟常让我爸拿铁戒尺把手都打肿了，可还是连一个字也没认下。” \n　　“可惜先生去世太早了！”田福堂惋惜地说，“我记得好象金大叔晚年也是气管有毛病？” \n　　“他就死在肺气肿上！”金俊武说。 \n　　“唉，我现在这气管病将来也说不定发展得象你爸一样。”田福堂说着便下意识地咳嗽了两声，脸上显出悲观的神色。“那是两回事。气管炎不一定就能蔓延成肺气肿。我爸到后来已经把病根子伸到心脏上了！” \n　　正在他两个拉谈已故金先生及肺气肿的时候，小学教师金成和大队会计田海民，气喘吁吁地跑进来说：“水头已经下来了！” \n　　田福堂和金俊武两个人一听水已经来了，把金先生和肺气肿早忘在脑后，跟着金成和田海民就往外跑。 \n　　他们来到公路边上，已经看见村后的河道在暗夜中闪烁着水波的微光。仔细一瞧，水头已经就在他们面前，象一条蟒蛇似的沿着干涸的河道刁钻地蜿蜒爬行——寂静的东拉河重新又响起了哗哗的水声！ \n　　多么令人兴奋啊！四个人在公路边上撵着水头，一路小跑着向前村赶去。金成和田海民一边跑，一边向前面坝梁上熙熙攘攘的人群呼喊着：“水来了！水来了！” \n　　整个水坝上的男女老少顿时都沸腾起来了。人们一边加紧往坝梁上运土，一边兴奋地喊叫着，张望着后面的河道。水即刻就涌进了土坝中！ \n　　和水一齐到来的田福堂立刻命令启动两台抽水机！于是，人们的呼喊声，哗哗的流水声，和抽水机的马达声搅混在一起，使得双水村这个夜晚象唱大戏一般喧腾和热闹！ \n　　但是乐极生悲。约摸半个钟头以后，这喧腾和热闹突然又变成了一片紧张的唏嘘声。人们惊慌地发现，水坝里的水上涨得太快了。顷刻间已经涌满了大半坝，而且眼看着要涨到刚加添的新土上了！ \n　　情况明显地危险起来。人们再也顾不得欢呼水的到来，反而对这水开始恐惧起来！ \n　　田福堂、金俊山立刻喊叫让大家赶快加高坝梁。刹那间，所有\n######################\nOutput:",
