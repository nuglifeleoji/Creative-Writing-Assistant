Poison in my drink...a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?”\n“The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to kill. There’s a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art among vendettas.”\nThe Duke’s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. /t cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.\n“What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman | love?” he asked.\n“An interpretation I’ve considered,” Hawat said. “Still...”\nThe Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.\n“What do you suggest?” the Duke whispered.\n“For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She Should be watched at all times. | will see it’s done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for the job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There’s a young man we've been training in Idaho’s\ntroop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement. He’s gifted in diplomacy.”\n“Don’t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.”\n“Of course not, Sire.”\n“And what about Paul?”\n“Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh.”\nLeto turned his back on Hawat. “I leave it in your hands.”\n“I shall use discretion, my Lord.”\nAt least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: “I will take a walk. If you need me, lIl be within the perimeter. The guard can—”\n“My Lord, before you go, I’ve a filmclip you should read. It’s a first-approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You'll recall you asked me to report on it.”\nThe Duke paused, spoke without turning. “Will it not wait?”\n“Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were Shouting, though. It was ‘Mahdi!’ They directed the term at the young master. When they—”\n“At Paul?”\n“Yes, my Lord. They’ve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.”\n“They think Paul is this...this....”\n“They only hope, my Lord.” Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.\nThe Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. “TIl look at it later.”\n“Certainly, my Lord.”\n“Right now, | need time to...think.”\n“Yes, my Lord.”\nThe Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and Stairs and balconies and halls...people who saluted and stood aside for him.\nIn time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard’s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.\n“At ease,” the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.\nA predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the southern horizon, the night’s second moon peered through a thin dust haze—an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.\nAs the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered.\nAnger shot through him.\nThe Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: /\nmust rule with eye and claw—as the hawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.\nTo the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.\nIt was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.\nSome things beggar likeness, he thought.\nHe had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the night’s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet...like giant footsteps.\n“It’s a beautiful morning, Sire,” the guard said.\n“Yes, it is.”\nThe Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.\nThen he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythelike devices—dew gatherers. Water so precious here that even the dew must be collected.\nAnd it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.\nThere is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man—with human flesh.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Duke said: “Paul, I’m doing a hateful thing, but\n| must.” He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing’s sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.\nThe Duke’s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.\nPaul had a viewer in front of him containing a Short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat’s experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.\n“Mahdi!”\n“Lisan al-Gaib!”\nHe could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.\n“A hateful thing,” the Duke said.\n“What do you mean, sir?”\nLeto turned, looked down at his son. “Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. They don’t know that I’d sooner distrust myself.”\n“| don’t understand, sir.”\nAgain, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.\nSlowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.\n“You might just as well mistrust me,” Paul said.\n“They have to think they’ve succeeded,” the Duke said. “They must think me this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham.”\n“But, sir! Why?”\n“Your mother’s response must not be an act. Oh, she’s capable of a supreme act...but too much rides on this. | hope to smoke out a traitor. It must seem that I’ve been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt.”\n“Why do you tell me, Father? Maybe l'Il give it away.”\n“They'll not watch you in this thing,” the Duke said. “You'll keep the secret. You must.” He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. “This way, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the\ntruth—that | never doubted her, not for the smallest instant. | should want her to know this.”\nPaul recognized the death thoughts in his father’s words, spoke quickly: “Nothing’s going to happen to you, sir. The—”\n“Be silent, Son.”\nPaul stared at his father’s back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.\n“You're just tired, Father.”\n“| am tired,” the Duke agreed. “I’m morally tired. The melancholy degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we were such strong people once.”\nPaul spoke in quick anger: “Our House hasn’t degenerated!”\n“Hasn't it?”\nThe Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a cynical twist of mouth. “l should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet...my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters.” He shrugged. “So, I....”\n“Mother has explained this to me.”\n“Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura,” the Duke said. “I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.”\n“You lead well,” Paul protested. “You govern well. Men follow you willingly and love you.”\n“My propaganda corps is one of the finest,” the Duke said. Again, he turned to stare out at the basin. “There’s greater possibility for us here on Arrakis\nthan the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes | think it'd have been better if we’d run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes | wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people, become less exposed LOR.\n“Father!”\n“Yes, | am tired,” the Duke said. “Did you know we're using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?”\n“Sire”\n“We mustn’t run short of filmbase,” the Duke said. “Else, how could we flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how well | govern them. How would they know if we didn’t tell them?”\n“You should get some rest,” Paul said.\nAgain, the Duke faced his son. “Arrakis has another advantage | almost forgot to mention. Spice IS in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in almost everything. And | find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common poisons of the Assassins’ Handbook. And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food production—yeast culture, hydroponics, chemavit, everything—under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large segments of our population with poison—and we cannot be attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.”\nPaul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: “I have to have someone | can say these things to, Son.” He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now—\ntrampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.\n“On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,” the Duke said. “Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House—running, hunted.”\nPaul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.\n“To hold Arrakis,” the Duke said, “one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect.” He pointed out the window to the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5b4cf765b6720dc548c976d10038dccd88a28043dc737e80c4f124ec76e89ca6_v2"}
