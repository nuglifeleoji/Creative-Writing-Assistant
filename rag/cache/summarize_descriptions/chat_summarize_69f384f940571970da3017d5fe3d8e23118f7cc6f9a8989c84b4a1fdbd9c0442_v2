Burzmali is Teg’s trusted associate and a key member of his mission team, often acting as a secondary protector of Bene Gesserit interests. Trained personally by Teg, Burzmali is regarded as his favorite student and has developed into a formidable military leader. Teg acknowledges Burzmali as the best candidate for Supreme Bashar, signaling both his confidence in Burzmali’s abilities and his intention for succession.  \n\nTheir partnership is particularly evident during critical missions, such as their operation on Gammu involving Duncan. Burzmali was sent by Taraza to assist Teg in this endeavor, underscoring his reliability and tactical prowess. Teg frequently relies on Burzmali for rescue operations, tactical support, and even transfers command to him during emergencies, demonstrating deep trust in his leadership. Teg is actively preparing Burzmali to take full command of operations, further solidifying his role as Teg’s successor.  \n\nIn summary, Burzmali is not only Teg’s most skilled protégé but also his indispensable ally, entrusted with high-stakes responsibilities and recognized as the future leader of their forces.
