The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. “And four into that ship over there!” He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. “Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!”\nThe tall man finished counting off his crew, came Slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions.\n“I hear the worm, but | can’t see it,” Kynes said.\nThe others heard it then—an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.\n“Damn sloppy way to operate,” the Duke muttered.\nAircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planet’s jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild OX.\nThe spice workers slogged up to the side of the ‘thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.\n“In you go, boys!” he snapped. “On the double!”\nPaul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action.\nHis father would have to order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn’t watch such things.\nThe last man came gasping into the rear, said, “The worm! It’s almost on us! Blast off!”\nThe Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: “We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?” He shut his door, checked it.\n“Almost exactly, my Lord,” Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this Duke.\n“All secure here, Sire,” Halleck said.\nThe Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.\nThe takeoff pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls— gently, surely. The ‘thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.\n“She's very heavy, Sire,” Halleck said.\n“Well within the tolerances of this ship,” the Duke said. “You didn’t really think I’d risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?”\nHalleck grinned, said: “Not a bit of it, Sire.”\nThe Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve— climbing over the crawler.\nPaul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters\nfrom the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.\n“The worm is now beneath the crawler,” Kynes said. “You are about to witness a thing few have seen.”\nFlecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.\nThen they saw it!\nA wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it. The hole’s diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine Slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.\n“Gods, what a monster!” muttered a man beside Paul.\n“Got all our floggin’ spice!” growled another.\n“Someone is going to pay for this,” the Duke said. “| promise you that.”\nBy the very flatness of his father’s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste!\nIn the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.\n“Bless the Maker and His water,” Kynes murmured. “Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people.”\n“What’s that you’re saying?” the Duke asked.\nBut Kynes remained silent.\nPaul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes’ head. One of them whispered: “Liet.”\nKynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.\nAnother of the rescued men began coughing—dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: “Curse this hell hole!”\nThe tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said: “Be you still, Coss. You but worsen your cough.” He stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the Duke’s head. “You be the Duke Leto, | warrant,” he said. “It’s to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.”\n“Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,” Halleck muttered.\nPaul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his father’s jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.\nLeto began easing his ‘thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.\n“Who’s that down there?” the Duke barked.\n“Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,” said the tall Dune man.\n“Why wasn’t something said about them?”\n“It was the chance they took, Soor,” the Dune man said.\n“My Lord,” said Kynes, “these men know it’s of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.”\n“We'll send a ship from base for them!” the Duke Snapped.\n“As you wish, my Lord,” Kynes said. “But likely when the ship gets here there'll be no one to rescue.”\n“We'll send a ship, anyway,” the Duke said.\n“They were right beside where the worm came up,” Paul said. “How’d they escape?”\n“The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,” Kynes said.\n“You waste fuel here, Sire,” Halleck ventured.\n“Aye, Gurney.”\nThe Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.\nPaul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so Surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.\nFremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course—because they are in no danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!\n“What were Fremen doing on that crawler?” Paul asked.\nKynes whirled.\nThe tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul—blue within blue within blue. “Who be this lad?” he asked.\nHalleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: “This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.”\n“Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?” the man asked.\n“They fit the description,” Paul said.\nKynes snorted. “You can’t tell Fremen just by looking at them!” He looked at the Dune man. “You. Who were those men?”\n“Friends of one of the others,” the Dune man said. “Just friends from a village who wanted to see the Spice sands.”\nKynes turned away. “Fremen!”\nBut he was remembering the words of the legend: “The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge.”\n“They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,” the Dune man said. “We should not speak unkindly on them.”\nBut Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.\nPaul spoke dryly: “A terrible place for them to die.”\nWithout turning, Kynes said: “When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature’s wants to direct him to that place.”\nLeto turned a hard stare at Kynes.\nAnd Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over\nthe spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men’s lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.\nAgainst his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: / like this Duke.\nGreatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| n the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bull’s head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke.\nBeneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table—little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison snooper had been concealed.\nPausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison Snooper and what it signified in his society.\nAll of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language—the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone try chaumurky tonight—poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas—poison in the food?\nHe shook his head.\nBeside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.\nFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>PERSON<|>Duke Leto Atreides is the leader of House Atreides, known for his bravery, leadership, and concern for his men.
