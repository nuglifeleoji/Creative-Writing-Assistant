人敢出来打撵——据说这里的狼早不把人放在眼里了。没有什么人洗脸，更不要说其它方面的卫生条件了。大部分人家除过一点维持活命的东西外，几乎都一贫如洗。有的家户穷得连盐都吃不起，就在厕所的墙根下扫些观音土调进饭里…… \n　　当田福军来到这些村子的时候，村民们几乎都跑出来站在远处观望他，就象来了一个外星人。每到一个村子，他都是一家一家地看。有些问题马上可以解决的，他当下就和队里的负责人商量着解决了。有些问题是需要公社解决的，他都记在了笔记本上。有些问题公社也解决不了，他准备回到县上后，会同有关部门，争取在短时期内尽快解决。 \n　　现在，田福军在一条崎岖的山路上爬蜒着，到最后一个“死角”去，他手里拉着一根柴棍，外衣搭在肩膀上，在这万籁寂静的山野里一边走，一边警惕地观察周围有没有野狼出现。 \n　　快过端阳节了，头上的太阳热烘烘的。山鸡和野鸡清脆的叫唤声，不时打破这梦一般沉寂的世界。大地上的绿色已经很惹眼了。大部分秋庄稼刚锄过一遍草。庄稼地中间的苜蓿盛开着繁密的紫红色的花朵。向阳的山坡上，稀稀拉拉的麦穗开始泛出了黄颜色；路边灰白的苦艾丛中有时猛地会窜出一只野兔子，吓得田福军出一头冷汗。 \n　　他一边走，一边揪了一把苦艾、凑得鼻子上去闻。这苦涩而清香的艾叶味，使他不由想起小时候的端阳节，他和福堂哥总要一大早就爬起来，拔好多艾草，别在门上，别在全家人的耳朵上，然后再揭开喷香的粽子锅……唉，从那时到现在，不觉得几十年就过去了。人啊，有时候觉得日子过得太慢；有时候又觉得太快了，简直来不及做什么！记得文化革命开始时，他刚三十出头，正是风华茂盛之时——结果这好年华白白地浪费掉了。前几年虽然恢复了工作，但也等于仍然在油锅里受煎熬。直到不久前“四人帮”被打倒后，他才好象一下子又变年轻了。只要国家有希望，工作就是把人累死也畅快！他多年来一直处在实际工作中，因此非常清楚十年文化革命所带来的灾难性破坏是多方面的，不可能在朝夕间就消除。他常想，作为一个基层领导干部，必须在他的工作范围内既要埋头苦干，又要动脑筋想新办法。当然，眼下最重要的仍然是农民的吃饭问题。现在看来，没有大的政策变化，这问题照样解决不了。那么，能解决多少就解决多少，最起码先不要把人饿死……临近中午的时候，\n######################\nOutput:",
