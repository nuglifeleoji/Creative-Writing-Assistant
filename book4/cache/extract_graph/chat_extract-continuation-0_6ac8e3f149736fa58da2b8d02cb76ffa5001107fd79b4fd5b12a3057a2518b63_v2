此同时，孙玉亭连家也没回，火急火燎地找到他哥孙玉厚，让他赶紧说服孙少安不要再执迷不悟；否则，恐怕公安局的法绳就要套到他娃娃的脖子上了！ \n　　那晚上的社员会孙玉厚没有去参加，因此并不知道儿子闯了这么大的乱子。 \n　　他紧张地听完玉亭的叙说后，立刻拉着弟弟到一队饲养院去找儿子。 \n　　老兄弟俩来到饲养院，因为秀莲坐月子，按乡规他们不能进家去。 \n　　他们就把少安从窑里叫到院子来。 \n　　兄弟俩立刻围住他，连说服带吓唬，让他赶紧声明不再“胡闹”了。孙玉亭还建议侄儿主动到公社投案，好争取党和政府从宽处理。 \n　　少安一看两个老人这么惊慌，心里烦乱极了。说心里话，他对这事也没有什么把握。但现在已经骑到了老虎背上，也不好轻易下来。尽管一般情况下他都老成持重，但有时也有年轻气盛的一面，事情究竟怎样，现在还没最后定论呢！他不能答应两个老人的要求。再说，事到如今，这事就不是他孙少安一个人的，而牵扯一队的几十户人家呢！他平静地对两个老人说：“我知道你们是为我好。但既然已经这样了，那就要好汉做事好汉当！你们先不要管，有什么差错我自己承担！” \n　　这老兄弟俩没想到少安这样回答他们，气得一时不知如何是好。 \n　　孙玉亭一看侄儿冥顽不化，干脆一拧身回家去了。哼！到时吃了亏，甭怨你二爸没提醒你小子！ \n　　孙玉厚一看玉亭走了，自己便抱住头蹲在寒风地里，急得几乎快要哭了。 \n　　少安见父亲这样痛苦，就劝他说：“爸，你别这样。你先回家去，让我一个人想想再说……” \n　　孙玉厚看当下说不转儿子，只好骂骂咧咧地走了……当田福堂气喘嘘嘘地赶到公社，向白明川和徐治功汇报了双水村的“严重政治事件”后，公社的两位主任也惊呆了，从白明川来说，他不久前心里也闪过这种设想，但很快就知道这不过是一种天真的想法而已——他没想到，孙少安这家伙竟然这样干开了！ \n　　两位主任意识到事情非同小可，公社也不敢处理，就立刻用长途电话向县革委会的领导作了汇报。 \n　　这消息顿时使原西县革委会炸了！ \n　　冯世宽很快召集常委们紧急开会——讨论双水村出现的严重的资本主义复辟倾向。 \n　　在会上，冯世宽没等大家说话，他自己先严肃地对这件事进行了批判性分析发言。在发言中间，他停顿了一下，立刻指示一名常委出去给各公社打电话，看其它公社有没有出现类似的情况；如果出现，要立即\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
