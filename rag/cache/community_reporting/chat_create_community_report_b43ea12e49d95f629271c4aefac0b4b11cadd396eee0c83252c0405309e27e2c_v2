They reside in various locations, including **Tabur Village**, **Tuono**, **False Sietch**, and areas near the **Sareer** and the **Wall**, where they tend to plants, date palms, and maintain remnants of Fremen life. While they strive to uphold ancient customs—such as crafting and selling contraband items like crysknife replicas—they are often criticized as mere imitators who lack true understanding of their forebears' warrior ethos. Some view them as degenerate descendants, having lost the original Fremen values, while others see them as caretakers of Leto II’s legacy on **Rakis**.  \n\nTheir role is complex: they submit petitions, interact with travelers, and are occasionally encountered during significant events, such as the **God Emperor’s visit** or the **climb of the Wall**. However, their authenticity has been compromised; they were once impersonated by **Face Dancers** disguised as pilgrims on the **Royal Road**, leading to suspicion about their true nature. Despite this, they remain a preserved institution, maintained by Leto II, and are distinct from traditional Fremen—though still feared by figures like **Duncan Idaho**, who encountered their artifacts in his quarters.  \n\nLed by **Garun**, the Museum Fremen function as modern practitioners, performing and safeguarding Fremen traditions as cultural relics rather than living them. Their existence reflects both reverence for the past and the inevitable dilution of their heritage under the God Emperor’s rule.\",13\n1450,TABUR VILLAGE,\"**Tabur Village** is a settlement located in the Sareer region, near the boundary wall, known for its relatively developed infrastructure compared to neighboring Tuono Village. It is a water-rich area inhabited by Museum Fremen, who cultivate plants and date palms. Initially, Tabur Village was planned as the location for Leto II's wedding ceremony, but the venue was later changed to Tuono Village. Despite this change, some sources still refer to Tabur as the intended or primary location for the event, highlighting its significance within the Sareer. The village's abundance of water and agricultural activity distinguishes it as a vital and thriving community in the region.\",6\n1398,FALSE SIETCH,\"False Sietch is a large, free-form building at the edge of Onn, serving as a school and historical site for the Museum Fremen>\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2799,MUSEUM FREMEN,ORAL HISTORY,The Museum Fremen preserve and perform the Oral History as part of their cultural preservation.,27\n3338,TABUR VILLAGE,SARER,Tabur Village is located within the Sareer region.,16\n3177,FALSE SIETCH,MUSEUM FREMEN,\"False Sietch serves as the school and residence for the Museum Fremen, preserving their traditions\",15\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
