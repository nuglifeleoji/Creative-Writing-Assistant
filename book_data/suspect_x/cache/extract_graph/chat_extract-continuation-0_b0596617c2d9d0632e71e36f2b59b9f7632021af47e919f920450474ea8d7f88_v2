And he saw how he’d been hemmed in by boundaries of love and the Jihad. And what was one life, no matter how beloved, against all the lives the Jihad was certain to take? Could single misery be weighed against the agony of multitudes?\n“Love?” Chani said, questioning.\nHe put a hand against her lips.\nlIl yield up myself, he thought. VII rush out while | yet have the strength, fly through a space a bird might not find. It was a useless thought, and he knew it. The Jihad would follow his ghost.\nWhat could he answer? he wondered. How explain when people taxed him with brutal foolishness? Who might understand?\nI wanted only to look back and say: “There! There’s an existence which couldn’t hold me. See! | vanish! No restraint or net of human devising can trap me ever again. | renounce my religion! This glorious instant is mine! I’m free!\nWhat empty words!\n“A big worm was seen below the Shield Wall yesterday,” Chani said. “More than a hundred meters long, they say. Such big ones come rarely into this region any more. The water repels them, | suppose. They say this one came to summon Muad’Dib home to his desert.” She pinched his chest. “Don’t laugh at me!”\n“I’m not laughing.”\nPaul, caught by wonder at the persistent Fremen mythos, felt a heart constriction, a thing inflicted upon his lifeline: adab, the demanding memory. He recalled his childhood room on Caladan then... dark night in the stone chamber... a vision! It'd been one of his earliest prescient moments. He felt his mind dive into the vision, saw through a veiled cloud-memory (vision-within-vision) a line of Fremen, their robes trimmed with dust. They paraded past a gap in tall rocks. They carried a long, cloth-wrapped burden.\nAnd Paul heard himself say in the vision: “It was mostly sweet... but you were the sweetest of all...”\nAdab released him.\n“You're so quiet,” Chani whispered. “What is it?”\nPaul shuddered, sat up, face averted.\n“You're angry because I’ve been to the desert’s edge,” Chani said.\nHe shook his head without speaking.\n“IL only went because | want a child,” Chani said.\nPaul was unable to speak. He felt himself consumed by the raw power of that early vision. Terrible purpose! In that moment, his whole life was a limb shaken by the departure of a bird... and the bird was chance. Free will.\nI succumbed to the lure of the oracle, he thought.\nAnd he sensed that succumbing to this lure might be to fix himself upon a single-track life. Could it be, he wondered, that the oracle didn’t te// the future? Could it be that the oracle made the future? Had he exposed his life to some web of underlying threads, trapped himself there in that long-ago awakening, victim of a spider-future which even now advanced upon him with terrifying jaws.\nA Bene Gesserit axiom slipped into his mind: Jo use raw power is to make yourself infinitely vulnerable to greater powers.\n“I know it angers you,” Chani said, touching his arm. “It’s true that the tribes have revived the old rites and the blood sacrifices, but | took no part in those.”\nPaul inhaled a deep, trembling breath. The torrent of his vision dissipated, became a deep, still place whose currents moved with absorbing power beyond his reach.\n“Please,” Chani begged. “I want a child, our child. Is that a terrible thing?”\nPaul caressed her arm where she touched him, pulled away. He climbed from the bed, extinguished the glowglobes, crossed to the balcony window, opened the draperies. The deep desert could not intrude here except by\nits odors. A windowless wall climbed to the night sky across from him. Moonlight slanted down into an enclosed garden, sentinel trees and broad leaves, wet foliage. He could see a fish pond reflecting stars among the leaves, pockets of white floral brilliance in the shadows. Momentarily, he saw the garden through Fremen eyes: alien, menacing, dangerous in its waste of water.\nHe thought of the Water Sellers, their way destroyed by the lavish dispensing from his hands. They hated him. He’d Slain the past. And there were others, even those who'd fought for the sols to buy precious water, who hated him for changing the old ways. As the ecological pattern dictated by Muad’Dib remade the planet’s landscape, human resistance increased. Was it not presumptuous, he wondered, to think he could make over an entire planet—everything growing where and how he told it to grow? Even if he succeeded, what of the universe waiting out there? Did it fear similar treatment?\nAbruptly, he closed the draperies, sealed the ventilators. He turned toward Chani in the darkness, felt her waiting there. Her water rings tinkled like the almsbells of pilgrims. He groped his way to the sound, encountered her outstretched arms.\n“Beloved,” she whispered. “Have | troubled you?”\nHer arms enclosed his future as they enclosed him.\n“Not you,” he said. “Oh... not you.”\nThe advent of the Field Process shield and the lasgun with their explosive interaction, deadly to attacker and attacked, placed the current determinatives on weapons technology. We need not go into the special role of atomics. The fact that any Family in my Empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the planetary bases of fifty or more other Families causes some nervousness, true. But all of us possess precautionary plans for devastating retaliation. Guild and Landsraad contain the keys which hold this force in check. No, my concern goes to the development of humans as special weapons. Here is a virtually unlimited field which a few powers are developing.\n—MUAD’DIB: LECTURE TO THE WAR COLLEGE FROM THE STILGAR CHRONICLE\nhe old man stood in his doorway peering out with blue-\nin-blue eyes. The eyes were veiled by that native suspicion all desert folk held for strangers. Bitter lines tortured the edges of his mouth where it could be seen through a fringe of white beard. He wore no stillsuit and it said much that he ignored this fact in the full knowledge of the moisture pouring from his house through the open door.\nScytale bowed, gave the greeting signal of the conspiracy.\nFrom somewhere behind the old man came the sound of a rebec wailing through the atonal dissonance of semuta music. The old man’s manner carried no drug dullness, an indication that semuta was the weakness of another. It seemed strange to Scytale, though, to find that sophisticated vice in this place.\n“Greetings from afar,” Scytale said, smiling through the flat-featured face he had chosen for this encounter. It occurred to him, then, that this old man might recognize the chosen face. Some of the older Fremen here on Dune had known Duncan Idaho.\nThe choice of features, which he had thought amusing, might have been a mistake, Scytale decided. But he dared\nnot change the face out here. He cast nervous glances up and down the street. Would the old man never invite him inside?\n“Did you know my son?” the old man asked.\nThat, at least, was one of the countersigns. Scytale made the proper response, all the time keeping his eyes alert for any suspicious circumstance in his surroundings. He did not like his position here. The street was a cul-de-sac ending in this house. The houses all around had been built for veterans of the Jihad. They formed a suburb of Arrakeen which stretched into the Imperial Basin past Tiemag. The walls which hemmed in this street presented blank faces of dun plasmeld broken by dark shadows of sealed doorways and, here and there, scrawled obscenities. Beside this very door someone had chalked a pronouncement that one Beris had brought back to Arrakis a loathsome disease which deprived him of his manhood.\n“Do you come in partnership?” the old man asked.\n“Alone,” Scytale said.\nThe old man cleared his throat, still hesitating in that maddening way.\nScytale cautioned himself to patience. Contact in this fashion carried its own dangers. Perhaps the old man knew some reason for carrying on this way. It was the proper hour, though. The pale sun stood almost directly overhead. People of this quarter remained sealed in their houses to sleep through the hot part of the day.\nWas it the new neighbor who bothered the old man? Scytale wondered. The adjoining house, he knew, had been assigned to Otheym, once a member of Muad’Dib’s dreaded Fedaykin death commandos. And Bijaz, the catalyst-dwarf, waited with Otheym.\nScytale returned his gaze to the old man, noted the empty sleeve dangling from the left shoulder and the lack of a stillsuit. An air of command hung about this old man. He’d been no foot slogger in the Jihad.\n“May | know the visitor’s name?” the old man asked.\nScytale suppressed a sigh of relief. He was to be accepted, after all. “I am Zaal,” he said, giving the name assigned him for this mission.\n“lam Farok,” the old man said, “once Bashar of the Ninth Legion in the Jihad. Does this mean anything to you?”\nScytale read menace in the words, said: “You were born in Sietch Tabr with allegiance to Stilgar.”\nFarok relaxed, stepped aside. “You are welcome in my house.”\nScytale slipped past him into a shadowy atrium—blue tile floor, glittering designs worked in crystal on the walls. Beyond the atrium was a covered courtyard. Light admitted by translucent filters soread an opalescence as silvery as the white-night of First Moon. The street door grated into its moisture seals behind him.\n“We were a noble people,” Farok said, leading the way toward the courtyard. “We were not of the cast-out. We lived in no graben village ... such as this! We had a proper sietch in the Shield Wall above Habbanya Ridge. One worm could Carry us into Kedem, the inner desert.”\n“Not like this,” Scytale agreed, realizing now what had brought Farok into the conspiracy. The Fremen longed for the old days and the old ways.\nThey entered the courtyard.\nFarok struggled with an intense dislike for his visitor, Scytale realized. Fremen distrusted eyes that were not the total blue of the Ibad. Offworlders, Fremen said, had unfocused eyes which saw things they were not supposed to see.\nThe semuta music had stopped at their entrance. It was replaced now by the strum of a baliset, first a nine-scale chord, then the clear notes of a song which was popular on the Naraj worlds.\nAs his eyes adjusted to the light, Scytale saw a youth sitting cross-legged on a low divan beneath arches to his\nright. The youth’s eyes were empty sockets. With that uncanny facility of the blind, he began singing the moment Scytale focused on him. The voice was high and sweet:\nA wind has blown the land away And blown the sky away\nAnd all the men!\nWho is this wind?\nThe trees stand unbent, Drinking where men drank.\nI’ve known too many worlds, Too many men,\nToo many trees,\nToo many winds.\nThose were not the original words of the song, Scytale noted. Farok led him away from the youth and under the arches on the opposite side, indicated cushions scattered over the tile floor.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
