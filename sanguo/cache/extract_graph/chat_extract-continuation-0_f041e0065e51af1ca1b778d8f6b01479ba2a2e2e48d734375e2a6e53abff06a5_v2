却说曹操回军，曹仁接着，言吕布势大，更有陈宫为辅，兖州、濮阳已失，其鄄城、东阿、范县三处，赖荀彧、程昱二人设计相连，死守城郭。操曰：“吾料吕布有勇无谋，不足虑也。”教且安营下寨，再作商议。吕布知曹操回兵，已过滕县，召副将薛兰、李封曰：“吾欲用汝二人久矣。汝可引军一万，坚守兖州。吾亲自率兵，前去破曹。”二人应诺。陈宫急入见曰：“将军弃兖州，欲何往乎？”布曰：“吾欲屯兵濮阳，以成鼎足之势。”宫曰：“差分。薛兰必守兖州不住。——此去正南一百八十里，泰山路险，可伏精兵万人在彼。曹兵闻失兖州，必然倍道而进，待其过半，一击可擒也。”布曰：“吾屯濮阳，别有良谋，汝岂知之！”遂不用陈宫之言，而用薛兰守兖州而行。曹操兵行至泰山险路，郭嘉曰：“且不可进，恐此处有伏兵。”曹操笑曰：“吕布无谋之辈，故教薛兰守兖州，自往濮阳，安得此处有埋伏耶？教曹仁领一军围兖州，吾进兵濮阳，速攻吕布。”陈宫闻曹兵至近，乃献计曰：“今曹兵远来疲困，利在速战，不可养成气力。”布曰：“吾匹马纵横天下，何愁曹操！待其下寨，吾自擒之。”\n\n    却说曹操兵近濮阳，下住寨脚。次日，引众将出，陈兵于野。操立马于门旗下，遥望吕布兵到。阵圆处，吕布当先出马，两边排开八员健将：第一个雁门马邑人，姓张，名辽，字文远；第二个泰山华阴人，姓臧，名霸，字宣高。两将又各引三员健将：郝萌、曹性、成廉，魏续、宋宪、侯成。布军五万，鼓声大震。操指吕布而言曰：“吾与汝自来无仇，何得夺吾州郡？”布曰：“汉家城池，诸人有分，偏尔合得？”便叫臧霸出马搦战。曹军内乐进出迎。两马相交，双枪齐举。战到三十余合，胜负不分。夏侯惇拍马便出助战，吕布阵上张辽截住厮杀。恼得吕布性起，挺戟骤马，冲出阵来。夏侯惇、乐进皆走，吕布掩杀，曹军大败，退三四十里。布自收军。\n\n    曹操输了一阵，回寨与诸将商议。于禁曰：“某今日上山观望，濮阳之西，吕布有一寨，约无多军。今夜彼将谓我军败走，必不准备，可引兵击之；若得寨，布军必惧：此为上策。”操从其言，带曹洪、李典、毛玠、吕虔、于禁\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
