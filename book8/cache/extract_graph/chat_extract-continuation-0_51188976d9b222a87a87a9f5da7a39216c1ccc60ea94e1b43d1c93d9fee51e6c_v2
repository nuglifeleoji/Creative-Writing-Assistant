索性，两人因为精神力都破百，才被允许。否则，他们甚至连这个机会都没有。\n\n    说到精神力，蓝轩宇的最新精神力测试数据连他自己都吃了一惊，一百三十七。而钱磊还在他之上，一百五十二。\n\n    除了他们两人之外，同学之中，超过五十的都没几个。所以，三三三寝室虽然整体实力被看做最弱，可因为他们两个优秀的精神力，还是被老师寄予一定希望的。\n\n    期中考试终于到来。无疑，这是第一次检验高能少年班成果的时候。\n\n    学期初的考核，是对于高能少年班本身素质的检测，三个月的学习、训练。每天都让这些小学员们疲惫不堪，但每个人都不想被淘汰、都很努力。那么，三个月后的现在，他们又究竟提升到了怎样的程度呢？有没有变化？变化有多大？都是天罗学院在付出了众多资源和努力之后急于了解的。从而调整后续的教学。\n\n    期中考试非常细致，分为文化课考核，身体数据测试和三人为一组的实战演练。实战比拼将会在模拟舱内进行，通过斗罗世界，可以让所有人全力以赴的战斗，而不需要担心真正伤害到对手，从而发挥出最大实力。\n\n    为了不耽误后续的学习，整个考试只用一天时间，上午是文化课考核和身体数据测试，下午则是实战考试。\n\n    文化课对于蓝轩宇和钱磊来说相对是最容易的。精神力强可不只是在操控魂力方面好用。在学习上同样好用。\n\n    五十点以上精神力就是灵通境了，而下一个层次灵海境的精神力要求是两百点。\n\n    蓝轩宇和钱磊精神力都在一百以上，距离灵海境也不太远了，在记忆力、悟性方面自然是远超他人的。所以，文化课考核对他们来说也可以算是轻而易举。如果不是钱磊这家伙平时比较懒，以他的精神力，甚至每次都考全班第一也很正常。\n\n    文化课考完，身体数据测试。\n\n    蓝轩宇是有些担心的。\n\n    身体数据分为力量、速度、精神力、魂力四项基本测试。毕竟他们都还只是学生，不需要太详细的数据。\n\n    “下一个，蓝轩宇。”\n\n    在老师的呼唤下，蓝轩宇来到测试区。\n\n    “首先进行力量测试。记住，稍候在测试的过程中不能使用魂力来增强自身力量。明白了吗？只是用你身体纯粹的力量。之后的速度测试也是。”\n\n    “明白。”\n\n    “准备。”老师带着蓝轩宇进入到一台仪器之中。\n\n    “两侧的墙壁将会逐渐合拢，你要做的，就是不让它们合拢。尽可能支撑更长的时间。”老师向蓝轩宇说道。\n\n    这台仪器两侧是金属璧，将会在测试开始后缓缓向内闭合。最终闭合到只能容纳一个人侧着身体站在那里的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
