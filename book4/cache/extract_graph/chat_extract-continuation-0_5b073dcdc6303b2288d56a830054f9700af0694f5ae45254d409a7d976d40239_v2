\n　　地委书记沙哑的嗓子带着哭音，在广播上绝望的作最后的呼唤。 \n　　逃命的人一边往高处撤退，一边心酸地抹着眼泪——亲爱的城市啊，眼看就要完了……凌岸四点钟，一串急促的电话铃声把省委书记乔伯年惊醒，这时候的电话一定有什么十万火急的事。他连衣服也没顾上披，跳下床抓起了话筒。电话是省防汛总指挥、副省长万国帮打来的——他报告了南部那个城市被水淹没的消息。 \n　　乔伯年头“轰”地响了一声，一阵眩晕几乎使他摔倒在茶几上，他立刻让万国帮和省长汪昭义直接去飞机场等他。 \n　　乔伯年先拨通了省军区司令员的电话，让他马上准备一架直升飞机，在省民航机场等候起飞。然后，他又用电话把常务副书记吴斌从床上叫起来，让他准备一块紧急飞往南部那个处于危难的城市。 \n　　吴斌一听发生了这么严重的事情，赶紧起床穿衣。他老伴要给他弄点吃的，被他喝住了。家里一片纷乱，吵醒了隔壁的儿子。 \n　　因为是星期六，吴仲平从工大回家来住宿。他听见父母亲在这个时候起床，不知发生了什么事，也赶紧穿衣起来。仲平很快从父亲那里弄清楚发生了什么事。 \n　　他突然想起了他在省报的好朋友高朗。高朗的父亲在市上任副市长，和他父亲交情很深，因此他和高朗也自然十分要好，吴仲平想到，对于一个记者来说，这是一个重大新闻。他应该立刻去找高朗，使他能争取搭乘省上领导的直升飞机到现场采访。他知道，高朗对新闻事业具有一种无畏的献身精神，这种采访对他来说是千载难逢！ \n　　出于友谊，吴仲平在父亲刚踏出门，就立刻冒着大雨跑到省委家属院值班室那里，叫起一个他所熟的汽车司机，迅速驱车赶到了省报。他让车停在报社大门外，自己用百米速度冲到报社单身宿舍楼上，拿拳头使劲擂高朗的门板。半天没人来开门，也不见屋里亮灯。 \n　　吴仲平正在焦急之时，见旁边一个房间的门开了，走出一位披着衫子的女同志。仲平认出这是田晓霞。她是高朗的朋友，他们三个曾在“黑天鹅”饭店有过一次聚餐。 \n　　“高朗出差去了。你这时候找他有啥事？”晓霞问他。吴仲平丧气极了。 \n　　他于是简短地向田晓霞说明了情况。 \n　　不料，田晓霞马上说：“我去！你带车了没有？”“带了。”吴仲平说。他没想到一个姑娘要去\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
