可是，到了晚上，这位老师就变成了最可怕的存在。\n\n    银天凡也没教蓝轩宇什么，就是带着他坐星际战机，让他充分体验星际战机强烈的冲击感。这段时间，就变成了蓝轩宇的地狱时间。\n\n    蓝轩宇不再和其他同学一起吃饭这件事，是由牧重天宣布的，作为惩罚，学院不再管他的伙食，由他自行解决，这才平息了上次的“民愤”。第一学期接下来的课程变得更加紧密起来，副职业课程全面加入，导致学员们每天的课程安排都变得特别紧张。\n\n    距离期末还有一个月的时候，年仅九岁的吕千寻终于成了全班第一个突破到二十级的人，成功进入二环修为。\n\n    拥有了第二魂环之后，他自然也成了全班的最强者。\n\n    吕千寻偶尔也会将目光投向蓝轩宇，期末将至，考核也将再次到来。这次，他有绝对的信心击败蓝轩宇，洗刷耻辱。\n\n    自从那次吃光早餐事件发生之后，同学们发现，蓝轩宇平时上课的时候，精神总有些恍惚，就连原本相当不错的文化成绩都开始下滑了。\n\n    知道他每天会去受折磨的，只有钱磊和刘锋，两人当然会为蓝轩宇保密。\n\n    蓝轩宇每天晚上都要体验一把乘坐星际战机的快感，精神没法不恍惚。\n\n    但蓝轩宇的付出也没有白费，他发现，自己在学习战舰驾驶基础的时候，无论驾驶什么车辆，反应速度都非常快，总是能够从容不迫地做出反还有，他自己都能明显感觉到，自己的身体素质在不断提升。\n\n    虽然只是乘坐星际战机，但那星际战机带来的冲击，仿佛能够锻炼他的身体。每天身体都会消耗巨大的能量，在有足够营养补充的情况下，他渐渐感觉到了好处。\n\n    所以，他现在乘坐星际战机，已经没有最初时那么难受了。\n\n    可是，他身体再好也架不住银天凡延长他的乘坐时间啊！每天必然要到他受不了，身体接近极限的时候才停止。\n\n    那次爆发出龙吟之后，蓝轩宇的魂力确实是提升了。不久前，他终于突破到了十五级。当然，在班上依旧垫底。\n\n    因为要跟着银天凡学习，蓝轩宇和刘锋、钱磊合练的次数也减少了些。偶尔才会召唤一下冻千秋，和娜娜老师也交谈几句。\n\n    每天实在是太忙碌了，总是有种晕头转向的感觉。最初，高能少年班的学员可以一周回家一次，可很快就改成了一个月才可以回家一次。距离第一学期期末考试，只剩下最后一个月了。\n\n    “�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YIN
