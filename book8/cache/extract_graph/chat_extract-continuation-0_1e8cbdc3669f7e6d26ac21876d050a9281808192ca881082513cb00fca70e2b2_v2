“嗯，等考核结束后，让他来找我。”副院长双眼微眯，眼中隐隐有光芒闪烁。\n\n    在他身边的季洪彬却是吓了一跳，“胖子，你可别把孩子教坏了？”\n\n    副院长一脸人畜无害的无辜状，“怎么可能？我这么随和的人。”\n\n    季洪彬没好气的道：“你随和？你随和个……”\n\n    此时，比赛场地内，战斗已经如火如荼的进行着。\n\n    迷宫本身并不算太大，就是为了让学员们不至于半天都碰不到对手。此时，已经碰面的学员都开始捉对厮杀。打的不亦乐乎。甚至出现了三组学员碰撞在一起，陷入一片混战的情况。\n\n    而蓝轩宇三人此时却依旧还在石堆后面，三人就坐在那里养精蓄锐。\n\n    钱磊压低声音道：“你们听，好像距离咱们不远就有一场战斗呢。我好像隐约听到了一些声音。要不要出去看看？他们这会儿应该都打起来了吧？”\n\n    “稍安勿躁。咱们不急。”蓝轩宇说道。\n\n    之前他们先后听到过两次脚步声。因为就在他们这边死胡同不远的地方，还有一个十字路口。先前那石像，本身就是守在十字路口的。发现他们之后，才向他们这边走过来。\n\n    经过十字路口的学员自然也会下意识的朝他们这边看看，看到是死胡同自然也就不会过来了，又哪里知道，在这儿还阴着仨人呢。\n\n    “你可真是沉得住气啊！”刘锋忍不住说道。\n\n    他有了蓝轩宇的增幅之后，战斗力好不容易大幅度增强了，真的是巴不得能出去战斗，和其他人大战一场。\n\n    他们这年纪，都很渴望表现自己，尤其是在高能少年班之中，更是如此。\n\n    蓝轩宇耸了耸肩膀，道：“不是我沉得住气，而是没有莽撞的意义。你们忘了？我们第一学期已经注定不会被淘汰了。我们现在当然可以像他们一样出去主动战斗，而且以我们现在的情况，应该也不会太差。但是，我们怎么能判断会遇到多少对手？但等在这里就不一样了，多等一会儿，说不定我们就真的有博取冠军的可能。在不会被淘汰的情况下，我们当然要选择最高的方向努力。就这么简单啊！”\n\n    是啊！就这么简单。\n\n    听他这么一说，钱磊和刘锋心中的焦躁顿时消失了。可不是么？他们已经没有被淘汰的风险了，干嘛急于求成呢？\n\n    等最好的机会，争取冠军无疑才是最正确的选择。\n\n    钱磊的精神力比蓝轩宇还高，听他这么一说，顿时就明白了过来，挑了挑眉毛，嘿嘿一笑，道：“那就让他们再打一会儿。等什么时候安静了，咱们再出去收拾残局\n######################\nOutput:",
