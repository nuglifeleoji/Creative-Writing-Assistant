无论和熟人还是和生人交往，都基本上不存在什么心理障碍了。加上他演过戏，又去黄原讲过故事，见了世面，这半年不光担任劳动干事，还被选成班上管宣传的团支部委员，因而显得比一般同学都要活跃一些。班上的同学都开始对他尊重起来，尤其是一些女同学，也开始用一种异样的眼光来看他了——就好象他是刚出现的一个新人。 \n　　但是郝红梅对他的态度仍然是平淡的。这段时间以来，她和顾养民已经真正的好起来了。有人看见她已经去过一回养民家；并且说她现在用的那个大红皮笔记本就是顾养民送给她的。孙少平现在对此很平静，心理上不再产生任何异常的反映。生活已经在他面前展现出更宽阔的内容。他的眼光开始向四面八方进射。 \n　　他已经不象刚入学那样，老是等别人打完饭才去取那两个黑馍；他渐渐抛弃了这种虚荣或者说自卑，大大方方站在队列中取他的饭。班里有几个家里光景好的同学，甚至成了喜欢他的朋友，有时候他们还背着他给他订一份乙菜呢。孙少平已经隐约地认识到，一个人要活得有意思，不仅是吃好的和穿好的，还应该具备许许多多他现在也不能全部说清楚的东西。当然，一想起家庭的贫困和自己生活的寒酸，他心里仍然发慌。但这一切和刚开始时已经完全不同了。 \n　　在这一段时间里，也许他最重要的收获就是和田晓霞的结识。通过和晓霞在一块演戏和讲故事，他被这个女孩子的个性和对事情非同一般的认识强烈地吸引了。这种心理决然不同于他和郝红梅的那种状态。他当初对红梅是一种感情要求，而现在对晓霞则是一种从内心产生的佩服。她读的书很多，看问题往往和社会上一般的看法不一样，甚至完全相反。有时她竟然还不同意报纸上的说法，这使孙少平常常大吃一惊。 \n　　他很想和田晓霞拉话——主要是听她说话。他心里想，晓霞要是个男同学就好了，他可以随便和她海阔天空地交谈。他觉得每次和她交谈，都能使自己的头脑多开一扇窗户。 \n　　可是田晓霞倒很大方，有时候主动来找他东拉西扯地说半天。由于他们在一块演过戏，讲过故事，论起来又是同村人，别的同学对他们的交往也没什么不良看法。 \n　　每当下午课外活动的时候，他正和同学们打篮球或者玩别的什么，总能看见田晓霞披着件衫子，两只手揣在裤口袋里，象个男孩子似的踱到操场上的报栏前，脸凑上去专心地看报纸。她几乎每天下午都要在那个报栏前呆半天，看了前面再看后面，直到看完才离开。 \n　　这时候，孙少平也往往找借口离开运动场，旋磨着来\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
