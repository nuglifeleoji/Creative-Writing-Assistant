操即差人星夜请华佗入内，令诊脉视疾。佗曰：“大王头脑疼痛，因患风而起。病根在脑袋中，风涎不能出，枉服汤药，不可治疗。某有一法：先饮麻肺汤，然后用利斧砍开脑袋，取出风涎，方可除根。”操大怒曰：“汝要杀孤耶！”佗曰：“大王曾闻关公中毒箭，伤其右臂，某刮骨疗毒，关公略无惧色；今大王小可之疾，何多疑焉？”操曰：“臂痛可刮，脑袋安可砍开？汝必与关公情熟，乘此机会，欲报仇耳！”呼左右拿下狱中，拷问其情。贾诩谏曰：“似此良医，世罕其匹，未可废也。”操叱曰：“此人欲乘机害我，正与吉平无异！”急令追拷。华佗在狱，有一狱卒，姓吴，人皆称为“吴押狱”。此人每日以酒食供奉华佗。佗感其恩，乃告曰：“我今将死，恨有《青囊书》未传于世。感公厚意，无可为报；我修一书，公可遣人送与我家，取《青囊书》来赠公，以继吾术。”吴押狱大喜曰：“我若得此书，弃了此役，医治天下病人，以传先生之德。”佗即修书付吴押狱。吴押狱直至金城，问佗之妻取了《青囊书》；回至狱中，付与华佗检看毕，佗即将书赠与吴押狱。吴押狱持回家中藏之。旬日之后，华佗竟死于狱中。吴押狱买棺殡殓讫，脱了差役回家，欲取《青囊书》看习，只见其妻正将书在那里焚烧。吴押狱大惊，连忙抢夺，全卷已被烧毁，只剩得一两叶。吴押狱怒骂其妻。妻曰：“纵然学得与华佗一般神妙，只落得死于牢中，要他何用！”吴押狱嗟叹而止。因此《青囊书》不曾传于世，所传者止阉鸡猪等小法，乃烧剩一两叶中所载也。后人有诗叹曰：“华佗仙术比长桑，神识如窥垣一方。惆怅人亡书亦绝，后人无复见青囊！”\n\n    却说曹操自杀华佗之后，病势愈重，又忧吴、蜀之事。正虑间，近臣忽奏东吴遣使上书。操取书拆视之，略曰：“臣孙权久知天命已归王上，伏望早正大位，遣将剿灭刘备，扫平两川，臣即率群下纳土归降矣。”操观毕大笑，出示群臣曰：“是儿欲使吾居炉火上耶！”侍中陈群等奏曰：“汉室久已衰微，殿下功德巍巍，生灵仰望。今孙权称臣归命，此天人之应，异气齐声。殿下宜应天顺\n######################\nOutput:",
