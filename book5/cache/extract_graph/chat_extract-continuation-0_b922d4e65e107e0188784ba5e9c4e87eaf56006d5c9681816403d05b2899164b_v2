平台的一角有一架数米高的天文望远镜，旁边还有几架较小型的。另一边是几台奇形怪状的仪器，很像古中国的浑天仪。最引人注目的是平台中央的一个大铜球，直径两米左右，放置在一台复杂的机器上，由许多大小不同的齿轮托举着，缓缓转动。汪淼注意到，它的转动方向和速度在不停地变化。在机器下方有一个方坑，在里面昏暗的火光中，汪淼看到几个奴隶模样的人在推动着一个转盘，为上面的机器提供动力。\n　　有一个人朝汪淼走来，与上次首遇周文王时一样，这人背对着地平线的曙光，只能看到黑暗中一双闪亮的眼睛。他身材瘦高，身着飘逸的黑色长袍，长发在头顶上不经意地缩了个结，剩下的在风中飞扬。\n　　“你好，我是墨子。”他自我介绍道。“我是海人，你好。”\n　　“啊，我知道你！”墨子兴奋地说，“在137号文明中，你追随过周文王。”\n　　“我是同他一起到过这里，但从不相信他的理论。”\n　　“你是对的。”\n　　墨子对汪淼郑重地点点头，然后凑近他说，“知道吗，在你离开的三十六万两千年里，文明又重新启动了四次。在乱纪元和恒纪元的无规律交替中艰难地成长。最短的一次只走完了石器时代的一半，但139号文明创造了纪录，居然走到了蒸汽时代！”\n　　“这么说，在那个文明中有人找到了太阳运行的规律？”\n　　墨子大笑着摇头：“没有没有，侥幸而已。”\n　　“但人们一直在努力吧？”\n　　“当然，来，我让你看看上次文明的努力。”墨子领着汪淼走到观星台一角，大地在他们下面伸展开来，像一块沧桑的旧皮革，墨子将一架小望远镜对准下面大地上的一个目标，然后让汪淼看。汪淼将眼晴凑到目镜上，看到一个奇异的东西，那是一具骷髅，在晨光中呈雪白色，看上去结构很精致。最令人惊奇的是这骷髅站立着，那姿势很是优雅高贵，一只手抬到颚下，似乎在抚摸着那已不存在的胡须，它的头微仰，仿佛在向天地发问。\n　　“那是孔子。”墨子指着那个方向说，“他认为，一切都要合乎礼，宇宙万物都不例外。他于是创造了一套宇宙的礼法系统，企图据此预测太阳的运行。”\n　　“结果可想而知。”\n　　“是的，他计算出太阳该循礼之时，就预测了一次长达五年的恒纪元，你别说。那一次还真持续了一个月之久。”\n　　“然后，有一天太阳再也没有出来？”\n　　“不，那天太阳出来了，升到了正空，但突然熄灭了。”\n　　“什么？熄灭？！”\n　　“是的，开始是慢慢暗下去、小下去。然后突然熄灭了！夜幕降临，那个冷啊，孔子就那么站着冻成\n######################\nOutput:",
