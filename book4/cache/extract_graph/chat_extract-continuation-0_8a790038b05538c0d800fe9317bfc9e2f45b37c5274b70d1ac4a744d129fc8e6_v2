\n　　“哎呀！这简直是……”这位领导人都没词了。润叶插嘴说：“二爸，你能不能给白叔叔和徐叔叔写个信，让他们把少安的姐夫放了。” \n　　田福军想了一下，就在桌子上拉过来一张纸，写了一封信，站起来交给少安，说：“你回去交给白明川。你认识他不？”“我认识。”少安说。 \n　　田福军又问了双水村的一些情况，少安都一一给他回答了。 \n　　“现在农村人连肚子都填不饱，少安，你看这问题怎解决好？”田福军突然问他。 \n　　少安就照他自己的想法说：“上面其它事都可以管，但最好在种庄稼的事上不要管老百姓。让农民自己种，这问题就好办。农民就是一辈子专种庄稼的嘛！但好象他们现在不会种地了，上上下下都指拨他们，规定这，规定那，这也不对，那也不对，农民的手脚被捆得死死的。其它事我还不敢想，但眼下对农民种地不要指手划脚，就会好些的……”“啊呀，这娃娃的脑子不简单哩！……好，罢了有时间，咱好好拉拉话！你要是到城里来就找我，好不好？我一会还要开个会，今天没时间了……” \n　　少安和润叶就很快告退了。田福军一直把他们送到院子的大门口。 \n　　在回学校的路上，润叶佩服地对少安说：“我二爸可看重你说的话哩！你真能行！” \n　　少安说：“你二爸是咱一个村的，又是你二爸，我敢胡说哩！” \n　　“少安哥，你干脆把我二爸的信给我，我明天和你一块回石圪节去。我和白明川和徐治功叔叔都很熟悉，到时候让我把信交给他们！” \n　　少安看她执意要和他一块回石圪节，也就把田福军的信交给了她——她出面当然要比他的威力大得多。 \n　　晚上，润叶把他安顿到学校她的宿舍里休息，她回她二妈家去睡。当她把被褥细心地给少安铺好后，少安却有点踌躇地说：“我怕把你的铺盖弄脏了……” \n　　“哎呀！你看你！”润叶红着脸对他说。她多么高兴少安哥在她宿舍里睡一晚上，好给她以后的日子加添新的回忆；也使她能时刻感觉到他留下的亲切的气息……第二天早晨吃完饭，少安就和润叶坐着公共汽车回石圪节去了。车票还是润叶买的；他抢着要买，结果被润叶掀在了一边。 \n　　汽车上，他俩紧挨着坐在一起，各有各的兴奋，使得这一个多钟头的旅行，几乎没觉得就过去了。 \n　　两个人在石圪节镇子对面的公路上下了车。 \n　　少安说：“要是你去公社，我就不去了，你爸也在公社开会，我去不好……我这就回家呀！你晚上回双水村去不？”润叶说：“我可想回去哩！但我明天还有\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
