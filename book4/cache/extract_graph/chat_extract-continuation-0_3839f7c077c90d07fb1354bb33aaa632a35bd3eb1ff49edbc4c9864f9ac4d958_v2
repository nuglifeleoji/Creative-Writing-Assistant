\n　　生民在这方面是行家里手，在任上不知接待过多少中央首长，因此芝麻一行，茄子一行，安排得井井有序。在副总理到达的前一天，省委书记乔伯年也赶到了黄原。副总理的专机预定从北京起飞后，直接到黄原机场降落。 \n　　根据张生民的要求，在专机降落之前，大街上除清扫的一干二净外，从飞机场到宾馆的道路上，还间隔站了许多警察。警察一律是白手套，佩戴着不装子弹的手枪，肃立在街头。为了防止一些人闯进宾馆找中央首长告状，张生民还出主意将地区人民来信来访办公室也搬到了宾馆门口，专门做堵挡工作。 \n　　上午十点半，专机降落在黄原机场。省地领导分别陪同中央首长乘两辆中型面包车来到宾馆。跟随副总理来黄原视察工作的有国家计划委员会副主任，农牧渔业部副部长，国务院农村发展研究中心副主任。另外，还有中央纪律监察委员会常委高步杰。我们知道，高老是黄原原西县人，对家乡的建设一直很关心；他这次跟随副总理来黄原是大家预料中的事。 \n　　中午吃饭时，原来准备的山珍海味都没敢上。四菜一汤，只在中间摆了一盘装饰性的菜花。田福军坚持要让副总理尝尝本地出产的一种酒，但张生民吓的不敢再“越轨”。“不怕，由我给副总理解释！这是我们自产的东西，也是我们的一点心意！”田福军没有听从生民的意见。 \n　　副总理实际上是一个很随和的人。他个头高大，脸色黝黑，满头白发，如果不是穿了一套西装，倒象个种地的老农民。他说话鼻音很重，不时用手势加强语气的分量。吃午饭的时候，他倒首先把桌子上的酒瓶抓起看了看，说：“黄原还能酿酒啊？” \n　　田福军赶忙说：“我们的酒在省里还小有名气哩，销量很不错！” \n　　“好，让我来尝一杯黄原酒！”副总理爽快地说。张生民心里的一块石头总算落了地。 \n　　副总理喝了一杯酒，细细品咂了一会，说：“就是不错！有点西凤酒的风格，但要比西凤绵一些。” \n　　这顿饭的主菜是大块子煮羊肉。副总理竟然豪爽地用手抓着吃，餐巾揉成一团，撂在旁边的桌子上。他的这种极随便的作风，使饭桌上的气氛立刻轻松起来。高老还不时和副总理开玩笑。 \n　　下午两点钟，中央和省地三级领导分别坐着中型面包车，到黄原市山区农村看了那里的一个养鸡场和另外两个村的“四法”种田。 \n　　离开最后一个村子时，副总理看村边的土场上有两个农民，就让车子停下来\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>黄原<|>GEO<|>黄原 is a city where the Vice Premier is visiting for
