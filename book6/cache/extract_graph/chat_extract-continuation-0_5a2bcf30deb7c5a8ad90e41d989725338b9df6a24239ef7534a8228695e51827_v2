抬头用异样的耳光看了雷迪亚兹一眼，目光敏锐的代表们都注意到了这一幕。\n　　“有一个办法可以破解你的摇篮，这种对付反触发的方法在冷战时期也被深入研究过。”美国代表说。\n　　“不是我的摇篮，是那些氢弹的摇篮，摇篮一停摇它们就会醒。”雷迪亚兹说。\n　　“我也想到了这个办法，”德国代表说，“信号从你的手表传到水星，必然要经过一个复杂的通讯链路，摧毁或屏蔽链路上的任何一个节点，然后用一个伪信号源向下一级链路继续发送反触发信号，就可以使‘摇篮’系统失去作用。”\n　　“这确实是个难题。”雷迪亚兹对德国代表点点头说，“如果没有智子，这个问题很容易解决：所有节点都装入一个相同的加密算法，每次发送的信号都由这种算法产生，在外界看来每次的信号值都是随机的，每次都不同，但‘摇篮’的发送和接收方却产生完全相同的序列值，接收方只有在收到与自己序列相对应的信号值时才认为信号有效。您的伪信号源没有这种加密算法，它发出的信号与接收方的序列肯定对应不上。但现在有智子这鬼东西，它能探测出这种算法。”\n　　“您也许想出了其他办法？”有人问。\n　　“一个笨办法，我这人，只能想出粗俗的笨办法。”雷迪亚兹自嘲地笑笑说，“增加每个节点对自身状态监测的灵敏度，具体作法就是每个通讯节点由多个单元组成，这些单元相距很远，但相互之间由连续的通讯联为一个整体，任何一个单元失效，整个节点就会发出终止反触发的命令，这之后，即使伪信号源再向下一节点发送信号也不被承认。各单元相互之间的监测精度目前可以达到微秒级，就是说，要按照刚才那位先生的办法，必须在一微秒内同时摧毁组成一个节点的所有单元，再用伪信号源进行信号接续。每个节点最少由三个单元组成，最多可能有几十个单元，这些单元之间的间距为三百公里左右（1），每一个都做得极其坚固。外界的任何触动都会令其发送警告。在一微秒之内同时使这些单元失效，也许三体人能做到，但人类目前肯定是做不到的。”\n　　①由于信号传输的光速限制，距离再远就达不到微秒级的监测精度了。\n　　雷迪亚兹的最后一句话使所有人警觉起来。\n　　“我刚刚得到报告，雷迪亚兹先生手腕上的东西一直在向外界发送电磁信号。”伽尔宁说，这个信息令会场气氛顿时紧张起来，“我想问，面壁者雷迪亚兹，您手表中的信号是发向水星吗？”\n　　雷迪亚兹大笑了几声说：“我为什么要向水星发？那里现在除了一个大坑外什么都没有，再说，‘摇篮’的太空通讯链路也没有建立。不不不，各位不要担心，信号不是发向水星，而是发向纽约市内距我们很近的一个地方。”\n　　空气凝固了，会场上除雷迪亚兹之外的所有人都呆若木鸡。\n　　“如果\n######################\nOutput:",
