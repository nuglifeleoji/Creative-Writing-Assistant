They were freezing his lovely Murbella! There was still that vitality in her, though. It tore at him. She gave off an aura of health, especially in pregnancy. Vigor and boundless enjoyment of life. It glowed in her. The Sisters would take that and dampen it.\nShe became quiet under his watchful stare.\nDesperate, he wondered what he could do.\n“I had hoped we were being more open with each other lately,” she said. Another Bene Gesserit probe.\n“| disagree with many of their actions but | don’t distrust their motives,” he said.\n“I'll Know their motives if | live through the Agony.”\nHe went very still, caught in realization that she might not survive. Life without Murbella? Yawning emptiness deeper than anything he had ever imagined. Nothing in his many lives compared with it. Without conscious volition, he reached out and caressed her back. Skin so soft and yet resilient.\n“Į love you too much, Murbella. That’s my Agony.”\nShe trembled under his touch.\nHe found himself wallowing in sentimentality, building an image of grief until he recalled a Mentat teacher’s words about “emotional binges.”\n“The difference between sentiment and sentimentality is easy to see. When you avoid killing somebody’s pet on the glazeway, that’s sentiment. If you swerve to avoid the pet and that causes you to kill pedestrians, that is sentimentality. ”\nShe took his caressing hand and pressed it against her lips.\n“Words plus body, more than either,” he whispered.\nHis words plunged her back into nightmare but now she went with a vengeance, aware of words as tools. She was filled with special relish for the experience, willingness to laugh at herself.\nAs she exorcised the nightmare, it occurred to her that she had never seen an Honored Matre laugh at herself.\nHolding his hand, she stared down at Duncan. Mentat flickering of his eyelids. Did he realize what she had just experienced? Freedom! It no longer was a question of how she had been confined and driven into inevitable channels by her past. For the first time since accepting the possiblity that she could become a Reverend Mother, she glimpsed what it might mean. She felt awe and shock.\nNothing more important than the Sisterhood?\nThey spoke of an oath, something more mysterious than the Proctor’s words at the acolyte initiation.\nMy oath to Honored Matres was only words. An oath to the Bene Gesserit can be no more.\nShe remembered Bellonda growling that diplomats were chosen for ability to lie. “Would you be another diplomat, Murbella?”\nIt was not that oaths were made to be broken. How childish! Schoolyard threat: “If you break your word, l'Il break mine! Nyaa, nyaa, nyaaaaa!”\nFutile to worry about oaths. Far more important to find that place in herself where freedom lived. It was a place where something always listened.\nCupping Duncan’s hand against her lips, she whispered: “They listen. Oh, how they listen.”\nEnter no conflict against fanatics unless you can defuse them. Oppose a religion with another religion only if your proofs (miracles) are irrefutable or if you can mesh in a way that the fanatics accept you as god-inspired. This has long been the barrier to science assuming a mantle of divine revelation. Science is so obviously man-made. Fanatics (and many are fanatic on one subject or another) must know where you stand, but more important, must recognize who whispers in your ear.\n—MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA, PRIMARY TEACHING\nhe flow of time nagged at Odrade as much as did\nconstant awareness of the hunters approaching. Years passed so quickly that days became a blur. Two months of arguments to gain approval of Sheeana as successor to Tam!\nBellonda had taken to standing day watch when Odrade was absent as she had been today, briefing a new Bene Gesserit remnant being sent Scattering. The Council continued this but with reluctance. Idaho’s suggestion that it was a futile strategy had sent shock waves through the Sisterhood. Briefings now carried new defensive plans for “what you may encounter.”\nWhen Odrade entered the workroom late in the afternoon, Bellonda sat at the table. Her cheeks looked puffy and her eyes had that hard stare they got when she suppressed fatigue. With Bell here, the daily summation would include sharp comments.\n“They've approved Sheeana,” she said, pushing a small crystal toward Odrade. “Tam’s support did it. And Murbella’s new one will be born in eight days, so the Suks claim.”\nBell had little faith in Suk doctors.\nNew one? She could be so damned impersonal about life! Odrade found her pulses quickening at the prospect.\nWhen Murbella recovers from this birth—the Agony. She Is ready.\n“Duncan’s extremely nervous,” Bellonda said, vacating the chair.\nDuncan yet! Those two are getting remarkably familiar.\nBell was not finished. “And before you ask, no word from Dortujla.”\nOdrade took her seat behind the table and balanced the report crystal on her palm. Dortujla’s trusted acolyte, now Reverend Mother Fintil, would not risk the no-ship journey or any of the other message devices they had prepared just to stroke a Mother Superior. No news meant the bait was still out there... or wasted.\n“Have you told Sheeana she’s confirmed?” Odrade asked.\n“| left that for you. She’s late with her daily report again. Not right for someone on the Council.”\nSo Bell still disapproved the appointment.\nSheeana’s daily messages had taken on a repetitious note. “No wormsign. Spice mass intact.”\nEverything upon which they pinned their hopes lay in terrible suspension. And nightmare hunters crept closer. Tensions accumulated. Explosive.\n“You've seen that exchange between Duncan and Murbella enough times,” Bellonda said. “Is that what Sheeana was hiding and, if so, why?”\n“Teg was my father.”\n“Such delicacy! A Reverend Mother has qualms about imprinting the ghola of Mother Superior’s father!”\n“She was my personal student, Bell. She has concerns for me you could not feel. Besides, this is not just a ghola, this is a child.”\n“We must be certain of her!”\nOdrade saw the name form on Bellonda’s lips but it remained unspoken. “Jessica.”\nAnother flawed Reverend Mother? Bell was right, they must be sure of Sheeana. My responsibility. A vision of Sheeana’s black sculpture flickered in Odrade’s awareness.\n“Idaho's plan has some attraction, but...” Bellonda hesitated.\nOdrade spoke up: “This is a very young child, growth incomplete. Pain of the usual memory restoration could approach the Agony. It might alienate him. But this...”\n“Control him with an Imprinter, that part | approve. But what if it doesn’t restore his memories?”\n“We still have the original plan. And it did have that effect on Idaho.”\n“Different for him but the decision can wait. You’re late for your meeting with Scytale.”\nOdrade hefted the crystal. “Daily summation?”\n“Nothing you haven’t seen too many times already.” From Bell, that was almost a note of concern.\n“I'll bring him back here. Have Tam waiting and you come in later on some pretext.”\nScytale had become almost accustomed to these walks outside the ship and Odrade observed this in his casual manner when they emerged from her transporter south of Central.\nIt was more than a stroll and they both knew it but she had made these excursions regular, designing repetition to lull him. Routine. So useful on occasion.\n“Kind of you to take me for these walks,” Scytale said, looking up sideways. “The air is drier than I recall it. Where do we go this evening?”\nHow tiny his eyes when he squinted against the sun.\n“To my workroom.” She nodded at outbuildings of Central about half a klick north. It was cold under a cloudless spring sky and warm colors of roofs, lights coming on in her tower, beckoned with promise of relief from a chilling wind that accompanied almost every sunset these days.\nWith peripheral attention, Odrade watched the Tleilaxu beside her carefully. Such tension! She could feel this also in guardian Reverend Mothers and acolytes close behind them, all charged to special watchfulness by Bellonda.\nWe need this little monster and he knows it. And we still don’t know the extent of Tleilaxu abilities! What talents has he accumulated? Why does he probe with such evident casualness for contact with his fellow prisoners?\nTleilaxu made the Idaho-ghola, she reminded herself. Did they hide secret things in him?\n“lam a beggar come to your door, Mother Superior,” he said in that whining elfin voice. “Our planets in ruins, my people slain. Why do we go to your quarters?”\n“To bargain in more pleasant surroundings.”\n“Yes, it is very confining in the ship. But | do not understand why we always leave the car so far away from Central. Why do we walk?”\n“I find it refreshing.”\nScytale glanced around him at the plantings. “Pleasant, but quite cold, don’t you think?”\nOdrade glanced to the south. These southern slopes were planted to grapes, crests and colder northern faces reserved for orchards. Improved vinifera, these vineyards. Developed by Bene Gesserit gardeners. Old vines, roots “gone down to hell” where (according to ancient superstition) they stole water from burning souls. The winery was underground as were storage and aging caves. Nothing to mar a landscape of tended vines in orderly rows, plantings just far enough apart for pickers and tilling equipment.\nPleasant to him? She doubted Scytale saw anything pleasing here. He was properly nervous as she wanted him to be, asking himself: Why does she really choose to walk me through these rustic surroundings?\nIt galled Odrade that they dared not employ more powerful Bene Gesserit persuasives on this little man. But she agreed with advice that said if those efforts failed, they\nwould not get a second chance. Tleilaxu had demonstrated they would die rather than give up secret (and sacred) knowledge.\n“Several things puzzle me,” Odrade said, picking her way around a pile of vine trimmings as she spoke. “Why do you insist on having your own Face Dancers before acceding to our requests? And what is this interest in Duncan Idaho?”\n“Dear lady, | have no companions in my loneliness. That answers both questions.” He rubbed absently at his breast where the nullentropy capsule lay concealed.\nWhy does he rub himself there so frequently? It was a gesture she and analysts had puzzled over. No scar, no skin inflammation. Perhaps merely a carryover from childhood. But that was so long ago! A flaw in this reincarnation? No one could say. And that gray skin carried a metallic pigmentation that resisted probing instruments. He was sure to have been sensitized to heavier rays and would know those were used. No... now, it was all diplomacy. Damn this little monster!\nScytale wondered: Did this powindah female have no natural sympathies on which he could play? Typica/s were ambivalent on that question.\n“The Wekht of Jandola is no more,” he said. “Billions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_867c6b17237705e07cf99882c6f9a15855debfea8ef65222529bff130a5a184e_v2"}
