His passion for beekeeping has grown, particularly after a significant incident that has impacted his relationship with the local community. 金光亮 takes great pride in his Italian bees, not only for their beauty and productivity but also for the high-quality honey they produce, which he sells to support his beekeeping endeavors.\n\nHowever, the situation surrounding his beekeeping has become complicated due to the issue of his missing bees. The disappearance of his 意大利蜂 has emerged as a central conflict within the village, leading to tensions among the residents. This conflict may stem from concerns about the health of the local bee population, the impact on honey production, or other environmental factors that could be affecting the bees.\n\nDespite these challenges, 金光亮 remains committed to his beekeeping practices and continues to work towards resolving the issues related to his missing bees. His dedication to the craft and the well-being of his bees reflects his deep connection to the art of beekeeping and the vital role that bees play in the ecosystem.
