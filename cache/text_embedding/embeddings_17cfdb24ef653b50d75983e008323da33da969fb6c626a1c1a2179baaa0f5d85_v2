bubbles enclosed him in agony. Water, vicious currents of it, buffeted him all around. He felt the gnashing of rocks as he struggled upward to broach ina torrential cascade, his body flexing in a paroxysm of involuntary, writhing splashes. The canyon Wall, wet and black, sped past his frantic gaze. Shattered spangles of what had been his skin exploded away from him, a rain of silver all around him darting away into the river, a ring of dazzling movement, brittle sequins—the scale-glitter of sandtrout leaving him to begin their own colony lives.\nThe agony continued. Leto marveled that he could remain conscious, that he had a body to feel.\nInstinct drove him. He clutched at a rock around which the torrent spilled him, felt a clutching finger torn from his hand before he could release his grip. The sensation of it was only a minor accent in the symphony of pain.\nThe river's course swept to the left around a chasm buttress and, as though saying it had enough of him, it sent him rolling onto the sloping edge of a sandbar. He lay there a moment, the blue dye of spice-essence drifting away from him in the current. The agony moved him, the worm body moving of itself, retreating from the water. All the covering sandtrout were gone and he felt every touch more immediate, a lost sense restored when all it could bring him was pain. He could not see his body, but he felt the thing that would have been a worm as it made its writhing, crawling progress out of the water. He peered upward through eyes that saw everything in sheets of flame from which shapes coalesced of their own accord. At last, he recognized this place. The river had swept him to the turn where it left the Sareer forever. Behind him lay Tuono and,\njust a ways down the barrier Wall, was all that remained of Sietch Tabr—Stilgar’s realm, the place where all of Leto’s spice had been concealed.\nExuding blue fumes, his agonized body writhed its way noisily along a shingle of beach, dragged its blue-dyed way across broken boulders and into a damp hole which might have been part of the original sietch. It was only a shallow cave now, blocked at its inner end by a rock fall. His nostrils reported the wet dirt smell and clean spice-essence.\nSounds intruded on his agony. He turned in the confinement of the cave and saw a rope dangling at the entrance. A figure slid down the rope. He recognized Nayla. She dropped to the rocks and crouched there, staring into the shadows at him. The flame which was Leto’s vision parted to reveal another figure dropping from the rope: Siona. She and Nayla scrambled toward him in a rattle of rocks and stopped, peering in at him. A third figure dropped off the rope: Idaho. He moved with frantic rage, hurling himself at Nayla, screaming:\n“Why did you kill her! You weren’t supposed to kill Hwi!”\nNayla sent him sprawling with a casual, almost indifferent sweep of her left arm. She scrambled closer up the rocks and stopped on all fours to peer in at Leto.\n“Lord? You live?”\nIdaho was right behind her, snatching the lasgun from her holster. Nayla turned, astonished, as he leveled the weapon and pulled its trigger. The burning started at the top of Nayla’s head. It split her, the pieces slumping apart. A shining crysknife spilled from her burning uniform and shattered on the rocks. Idaho did not see it. A grimace of rage on his face, he kept burning and burning the pieces of Nayla until the weapon’s charge was gone. The blazing arc vanished. Only wet and smoking bits of meat and cloth lay scattered among the glowing rocks.\nIt was the moment for which Siona had waited. She scrambled up to him and pulled the useless lasgun from\nIdaho’s hands. He whirled toward her and she poised herself to subdue him, but all the rage was gone.\n“Why?” he whispered.\n“It’s done,” she said.\nThey turned and looked into the cave shadows at Leto.\nLeto could not even imagine what they saw. The Sandtrout skin was gone, he knew. There would be some kind of surface pocked with cilia holes from the departed Skin. As for the rest, he could only look back at the two figures from a universe furrowed by sorrow. Through the vision flames he saw Siona as a female demon. The demon name came unbidden to his minds and he spoke it aloud, amplified by the cave and much louder than he had expected:\n“Hanmyal!”\n“What?” She moved a step closer to him.\nIdaho put both hands over his face.\n“Look at what you’ve done to poor Duncan,” Leto said.\n“He'll find other loves.” How callous she sounded, an echo of his own angry youth.\n“You don’t know what it is to love,” he said. “What have you ever given?” He could only wring his hands then, those travesties which once had been his hands. “Gods below! What I’ve given!”\nShe scrambled closer and reached toward him, then drew back.\n“lam reality, Siona. Look upon me. | exist. You can touch me if you dare. Reach out your hand. Do it!”\nSlowly, she reached toward what had been his front segment, the place where she had slept in the Sareer. Her hand was touched with blue when she withdrew it.\n“You have touched me and felt my body,” he said. “Is that not strange beyond any other thing in this universe?”\nShe started to turn away.\n“No! Don’t turn away from me! Look at what you have wrought, Siona. How is it that you can touch me but you\ncannot touch yourself?”\nShe whirled away from him.\n“There is the difference between us,” he said. “You are God embodied. You walk around within the greatest miracle of this universe, yet you refuse to touch or see or feel or believe in it.”\nLeto’s awareness went wandering then into a night- encircled place, a place where he thought he could hear the metal insect song of his hidden printers clacking away in their lightless room. There was a complete absence of radiation in this place, an Ixian no-thing which made it a place of anxiety and spiritual alienation because it had no connection with the rest of the universe.\nBut it will have a connection.\nHe sensed then that his Ixian printers had been set in motion, that they were recording his thoughts without any special command.\nRemember what I did! Remember me! | will be innocent again!\nThe flame of his vision parted to reveal Idaho standing where Siona had stood. There was gesturing motion somewhere out of focus behind Idaho... ah, yes: Siona waving instructions to someone atop the barrier Wall.\n“Are you still alive?” Idaho asked.\nLeto’s voice came in wheezing gasps: “Let them scatter, Duncan. Let them run and hide anywhere they want in any universe they choose.”\n“Damn you! What’re you saying? I’d have sooner let her live with you!”\n“Let? | did not /et anything.”\n“Why did you let Hwi die?” Idaho moaned. “We didn’t know she was in there with you.”\nIdaho’s head sagged forward.\n“You will be recompensed,” Leto husked. “My Fish Speakers will choose you over Siona. Be kind to her,\nDuncan. She is more than Atreides and she carries the seed of your survival.”\nLeto sank back into his memories. They were delicate myths now, held fleetingly in his awareness. He sensed that he might have fallen into a time which, by its very being, had changed the past. There were sounds, though, and he struggled to interpret them. Someone scrambling on rocks? The flames parted to reveal Siona standing beside Idaho. They stood hand-in-hand like two children reassuring each other before venturing into an unknown place.\n“How can he live like that?” Siona whispered.\nLeto waited for the strength to respond. “Hwi helps me,” he said. “We had something few experience. We were joined in our strengths rather than in our weaknesses.”\n“And look what it got you!” Siona sneered.\n“Yes, and pray that you get the same,” he husked. “Perhaps the spice will give you time.”\n“Where is your spice?” she demanded.\n“Deep in Sietch Tabr,” he said. “Duncan will find it. You know the place, Duncan. They call it Tabur now. The outlines are still there.”\n“Why did you do it?” Idaho whispered.\n“My gift,” Leto said. “Nobody will find the descendants of Siona. The Oracle cannot see her.”\n“What?” They spoke in unison, leaning close to hear his fading voice.\n“I give you a new kind of time without parallels,” he said. “It will always diverge. There will be no concurrent points on its curves. | give you the Golden Path. That is my gift. Never again will you have the kinds of concurrence that once you had.”\nFlames covered his vision. The agony was fading, but he could still sense odors and hear sounds with a terrible acuity. Both Idaho and Siona were breathing in quick, Shallow gasps. Odd kinesthetic sensations began to weave\ntheir way through Leto—echoes of bones and joints which he knew he no longer possessed.\n“Look!” Siona said.\n“He’s disintegrating.” That was Idaho.\n“No.” Siona. “The outside is falling away. Look! The Worm!”\nLeto felt parts of himself settling into warm softness. The agony removed itself.\n“What're those holes in him?” Siona.\n“I think they were the sandtrout. See the shapes?”\n“lam here to prove one of my ancestors wrong,” Leto said (or thought he said, which was the same thing as far as his journals were concerned). “I was born a man but | do not die a man.”\n“I can’t look!” Siona said.\nLeto heard her turn away, a rattle of rocks.\n“Are you still there, Duncan?”\n“Yes.”\nSo I still have a voice.\n“Look at me,” Leto said. “I was a bloody bit of pulp in a human womb, a bit no larger than a cherry. Look at me, | say!”\n“I’m looking.” Idaho’s voice was faint.\n“You expected a giant and you found a gnome,” Leto said. “Now, you're beginning to know the responsibilities which come as a result of actions. What will you do with your new power, Duncan?”\nThere was a long silence, then Siona’s voice: “Don’t listen to him! He was mad!”\n“Of course,” Leto said. “Madness in method, that is genius.”\n“Siona, do you understand this?” Idaho asked. How plaintive, the ghola voice.\n“She understands,” Leto said. “It is human to have your soul brought to a crisis you did not anticipate. That’s the way it always is with humans. Moneo understood at last.”\n“I wish he’d hurry up and die!” Siona said.\n“lam the divided god and you would make me whole,” Leto said. “Duncan? | think of all my Duncans | approve of you the most.”\n“Approve?” Some of the rage returned to Idaho’s voice. “There’s magic in my approval,” Leto said. “Anything’s possible in a magic universe. Your life has been dominated\nby the Oracle’s fatality, not mine. Now", " silence, then Siona’s voice: “Don’t listen to him! He was mad!”\n“Of course,” Leto said. “Madness in method, that is genius.”\n“Siona, do you understand this?” Idaho asked. How plaintive, the ghola voice.\n“She understands,” Leto said. “It is human to have your soul brought to a crisis you did not anticipate. That’s the way it always is with humans. Moneo understood at last.”\n“I wish he’d hurry up and die!” Siona said.\n“lam the divided god and you would make me whole,” Leto said. “Duncan? | think of all my Duncans | approve of you the most.”\n“Approve?” Some of the rage returned to Idaho’s voice. “There’s magic in my approval,” Leto said. “Anything’s possible in a magic universe. Your life has been dominated\nby the Oracle’s fatality, not mine. Now, you see the mysterious caprices and you would ask me to dispel this? | wished only to increase it.”\nThe others within Leto began to reassert themselves. Without the solidarity of the colonial group to support his identity, he began to lose his place among them. They started speaking the language of the constant “IF.” “If you had only... If we had but...” He wanted to shout them into silence.\n“Only fools prefer the past!”\nLeto did not know if he truly shouted or only thought it. The response was a momentary inner silence matched to an outer silence and he felt some of the threads of his old identity still intact. He tried to speak and knew the reality of it because Idaho said, “Listen, he’s trying to say something.”\n“Do not fear the Ixians,” he said, and he heard his own voice as a fading whisper. “They can make the machines, but they no longer can make arafel. | know. | was there.”\nHe fell silent, gathering his strength, but he felt the energy flowing from him even as he tried to hold it. Once more, the clamor arose within him—voices pleading and shouting.\n“Stop that foolishness!” he cried, or thought he cried.\nIdaho and Siona heard only a gasping hiss.\nPresently, Siona said: “I think he’s dead.”\n“And everyone thought he was immortal,” Idaho said.\n“Do you know what the Oral History says?” Siona asked. “If you want immortality, then deny form. Whatever has\nform has mortality. Beyond form is the formless, the immortal.”\n“That sounds like him,” Idaho accused.\n“I think it was,” she said.\n“What did he mean about your descendants. . . hiding, not finding them?” Idaho asked.\n“He created a new kind of mimesis,” she said, “a new biological imitation. He knew he had succeeded. He could not see me in his futures.”\n“What are you?” Idaho demanded.\n“I’m the new Atreides.”\n“Atreides!” It was a curse in Idaho’s voice.\nSiona stared down at the disintegrating hulk which once had been Leto Atreides Il... and something else. The something else was sloughing away in faint wisps of blue smoke where the smell of melange was strongest. Puddles of blue liquid formed in the rocks beneath his melting bulk. Only faint vague shapes which might once have been human remained—a collapsed foaming pinkness, a bit of red-streaked bone which could have held the forms of cheeks and brow...\nSiona said: “I am different, but still | am what he was.” Idaho spoke in a hushed whisper: “The ancestors, all Ofna”\n“The multitude is there but | walk silently among them and no one sees me. The old images are gone and only the essence remains to light his Golden Path.”\nShe turned and took Idaho’s cold hand in hers. Carefully, she led him out of the cave into the light where the rope dangled invitingly from the barrier Wall’s top, from the place where the frightened Museum Fremen waited.\nPoor material with which to shape a new universe, she thought, but they would have to serve. Idaho would require gentle seduction, a care within which love might appear.\nWhen she looked down the river to where the flow emerged from its man-made chasm to spread across the\ngreen lands, she saw a wind from the south driving dark clouds toward her.\nIdaho withdrew his hand from hers, but he appeared calmer. “Weather control is increasingly unstable,” he said. “Moneo thought it was the Guild’s doing.”\n“My father was seldom mistaken about such things,” she said. “You will have to look into that.”\nIdaho experienced a sudden memory of the silvery shapes of sandtrout darting away from Leto’s body in the river.\n“| heard the Worm,” Siona said. “The Fish Speakers will follow you, not me.”\nAgain, Idaho sensed the temptation from the ritual of Siaynog. “We will see,” he said. He turned and looked at Siona. “What did he mean when he said the Ixians cannot create arafel?”\n“You haven't read all the journals,” she said. “I'll show you when we return to Tuono.”\n“But what does it mean—arafel?”\n“That’s the cloud-darkness of holy judgment. It’s from an old story. You'll find it all in my journals.”\nExcerpt from the Hadi Benotto secret summation on the discoveries at Dar-es-Balat:\nHerewith the minority report. We will, of course, comply with the majority decision to apply a careful screening, editing and censorship to the journals from Dar-es-Balat, but our arguments must be heard. We recognize the interest of Holy Church in these matters and the political dangers have not escaped our notice. We share a desire with the Church that Rakis and the Holy Reservation of the Divided God not become “an attraction for gawking tourists.”\nHowever, now that all of the journals are in our hands, authenticated and translated, the clear shape of the Atreides Design emerges. As a woman trained by the Bene Gesserit to understand the ways of our ancestors, | have a natural desire to share the pattern we have exposed—which is so much more than Dune to Arrakis to Dune, thence to Rakis.\nThe interests of history and science must be served. The journals throw a valuable new light onto that accumulation of personal recollections and biographies from the Duncan Days, the Guard Bible. We cannot be unmindful of those familiar oaths: “By the Thousand Sons of Idaho!” and “By the Nine Daughters of Siona!” The persistent Cult of Sister Chenoeh assumes new significance because of the journals’ disclosures. Certainly, the Church’s characterization of Judas/Nayla deserves careful reevaluation.\nWe of the Minority must remind the political censors that the poor sandworms in their Rakian Reservation cannot provide us with an alternative to Ixian Navigation Machines, nor are the tiny amounts of Church-controlled melange any real commercial threat to the products of the Tleilaxu vats. No! We argue that the myths, the Oral History, the Guard\nBible, and even the Holy Books of the Divided God must be compared with the journals from Dar-es-Balat. Every historical reference to the Scattering and the Famine Times has to be taken out and reexamined! What have we to fear? No Ixian machine can do what we, the descendants of Duncan Idaho and Siona, have done. How many universes have we populated? None can guess. No one person will ever know. Does the Church fear the occasional prophet? We know that the visionaries cannot see us nor predict our decisions. No death can find all of humankind. Must we of the Minority join our fellows of the Scattering before we can be heard? Must we leave the original core of humankind ignorant and uninformed? If the Majority drives us out, you know we never again can be found!\nWe do not want to leave. We are held here by those pearls in the sand. We are fascinated by the Church’s use of the pearl as “the sun of understanding.” Surely, no reasoning human can escape the journals’ revelations in this regard. The admittedly fugitive but vital uses of archeology must have their day! Just as the primitive machine with which Leto II concealed his journals can only teach us about the evolution of our machines, just so, that ancient awareness must be allowed to speak to us. It would be a crime against both historical accuracy and science for us to abandon our attempts at communication with those “pearls of awareness” which the journals have located. Is Leto II lost in his endless dream or could he be reawakened to our times, brought to full consciousness as a storehouse of historical accuracy? How can Holy Church fear this truth?\nFor the Minority, we have no doubt that historians must listen to that voice from our beginnings. If it is only the journals, we must listen. We must listen across at least as many years into our future as those journals lay hidden in our past. We will not try to predict the discoveries yet to be made within those pages. We say only that they must be made. How can we turn our backs on our most important\ninheritance? As the poet, Lon Bramlis, has said: “We are the fountain of surprises!”\nHERETICS OF\nŞ c\nFRANK HERBERT\n \nHERETICS OF DUNE\nBROOK FIVE TN THF DUNF CHRONICLES\nFRANK HERBERT With wa Intradaction by Brian Ierbe rt\nACE Published by Berkley An imprint of Penguin Random House LLC 1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10019\nCopyright © 1984 by Herbert Properties LLC\n“Introduction” by Brian Herbert copyright © 2009 by DreamStar, Inc.\nPenguin Random House supports copyright.

He had not expected to be writing there, because the Pacific Northwest was his Tara, the place of his heart. But difficult circumstances led him to a distant, tropical isle.\nWhen my father signed the contract for the novel in 1981, it was the largest science fiction book deal in history. World famous, he was at the top of his profession, having risen from poverty to success in a fashion that was reminiscent of the works of Horatio Alger, Jr. But Dad’s remarkable achievement was bittersweet. The actual process of writing the fifth book in his classic Dune series would prove to be exceedingly arduous and much slower for him than usual, because of all the time he had to spend out of his study tending to the medical crises of my mother, Beverly Herbert.\nShe was seriously ill at the time, and for years had been battling valiantly for her life. The original diagnosis in 1974 had been terminal lung cancer from a lifetime of smoking Cigarettes, sometimes as many as two packs a day. At the time of the discovery of the dread disease, the most optimistic prognosis had given her only a 5 percent chance of surviving beyond six months. Our family was devastated.\nUnder a rigorous program of chemotherapy and cobalt radiation treatments, my mother beat the cancer, but radiation seriously damaged her heart, which was\ninadequately shielded because of the limitations of medical technology in the 1970s. After these treatments, she suffered several life-threatening episodes, but Beverly Herbert was a fighter, and my father did everything possible to save her. He was her champion, and in true heroic fashion he sacrificed himself for her, just as she had done for him more than two decades earlier—when she gave up her own creative writing career in order to become the breadwinner for our family, thus enabling him to write. When she became gravely ill, he took time away from his writing to find the latest treatments for her and tended to her every need. He became her personal nurse, maid, and cook, preparing the low-salt meals required for her. Under his loving attention, she kept beating the odds, kept rising like Lazarus from ICU hospital beds and going on with her life. As soon as she was able, she continued to help Dad with his business operations, handling his accounting, scheduling, and management. But over the years, she had weakened physically and was slipping away from us, and from him.\nStretching their financial resources to the limit, in 1980 my parents purchased an incredible piece of property ina remote area of Maui and proceeded to have a wonderful home built there. Frank Herbert did this for my mother because she could breathe much easier in the warm air of Hawaii, far from the cold, damp Pacific Northwest, where she had been born and had lived more than thirty-five years of her life.\nBy late 1982, the home was still under construction but could be occupied. They arrived in October of that year. A swimming pool was being built for Mom on the property so that she could get some much-needed exercise, but work was progressing slowly, frustrating her and my father. Even so, she loved the eastern side of Maui, with its warmth, stunning beauty, and relaxed pace of life. It was a very Spiritual, old-Hawaiian region, inhabited by a people\nreminiscent of a bygone, less-hectic time, and it was the perfect spot for her to recuperate.\nHaving researched old records, my mother had already found a map showing their property. It was five miles from Hana, in an area that used to be called “Kawaloa,” which means “a nice long time” in the Hawaiian language. She said she hoped to spend a long time there herself and that it was a magical place, unlike anything she had ever seen. A five-acre piece of paradise, the land fronted an aquamarine sea with dancing whitecaps and a surf that pounded against the black lava shoreline. The property had palms, papayas, mangoes, bananas, breadfruit trees, and a graceful kamani tree overlooking the water. The flowers on the gentle slopes around the home were spectacular, with bougainvillaea, blue lilies, orchids, torch gingers, heliconias, bird-of- paradises, poinsettias, and huge hibiscus blossoms.\n“It’s warm here,” my mother said to me over the telephone, “and there are flowers everywhere.”\nIn Hawaii, Frank Herbert set to work on Heretics of Dune. | spoke with him by phone in early January 1983, and he told me he was putting in long hours on the new novel, pressing to complete it as soon as possible. Each morning he rose before dawn and worked out on a rowing machine and an Exercycle. Then he took a quick shower and made a light breakfast of toast and guava juice, which he carried to his loft study on the second floor of the house.\nAfter writing for three hours, he would help Mom get ready for the day. He made her Cream of Wheat with sliced bananas on top, found books and knitting materials and art supplies and whatever else she needed, and sometimes adjusted the louvers in the walls to allow just the right amount of trade winds to enter, naturally ventilating the interior of the house. By nine thirty he was back at his desk upstairs, but he was always going to the interior railing and looking down into the living room to make sure she was comfortable. Under the circumstances, it was difficult for\nhim to find the time or the energy to write, but he did the best that he possibly could. The novel, as important as it was, had to be secondary to Beverly Herbert, his loving wife and companion since 1946.\nFor the new book project, he was using a Compaq word processor since it was much faster than his customary electric typewriter. Each night he put the new machine away in a sealed “dry room” by the kitchen to prevent it from being damaged so quickly in the caustic, salty air that blew in from the ocean. By the middle of February, he told me he’d been having plot problems with the novel, but he was a little over halfway through the first draft. Only a few days later, he was interrupted by yet another of my mother’s medical emergencies, one that forced them to return to a home they still owned in Port Townsend, Washington. Choosing to stay there instead, a short distance from Seattle, they could more easily obtain the best medical treatment for her. It was the practical thing to do, though they would return to Hawaii later in the year.\nBy early June, they were still in Port Townsend, and Dad had the first draft completed—around 200,000 words, which would eventually be cut to 165,000. | remember visiting them at their home on the Olympic Peninsula and seeing my mother reading the manuscript. A slender brunette woman, she was seated on a dark yellow recliner in the sitting area adjacent to the kitchen, with manuscript pages spread out on the table beside her. She said the story was great, that She couldn’t put it down. Mom felt that each book in the series was Superior to the one before, with plots and characterizations that were even better than Dune.\nThe strong characterizations of women in the series—and particularly in Heretics and Chapterhouse—appealed greatly to my mother. In fact, Dad based the Lady Jessica on her, creating a memorable literary character who had my mother’s beauty and grace. Remarkably, even though Beverly Herbert passed away years ago, she continues to\nlive through the ages... a significant testimonial to the love that Frank Herbert felt for her.\nIt is interesting to note the progression of women in my father’s Dune novels. Female characters get stronger and stronger as the series develops, and in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune, women are running most of the important planets in the Dune universe. By that time, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood is the most important political power, although it is a more austere age, without the grandeur and pomposity of the Imperium back in the days of Shaddam Corrino IV, the Emperor Paul Muad’Dib, or the tyrannical God Emperor, Leto Atreides II. The glories of the desert planet Arrakis are long gone as well, and the Sandworm species has been moved off world, where it may not survive.\nThousands of years before the events described in Heretics of Dune, the God Emperor set mankind on his “Golden Path” and scattered civilization across countless star systems, as if sprinkling human seeds in the wind. But now, in Heretics of Dune, evil, supremely powerful women have emerged from the Scattering and threaten the Sisterhood. They call themselves “Honored Matres,” which is ironic because there is nothing honorable about them. Individually and collectively, they can outfight the Sisters, so that the Sisterhood—like the sandworms—seems in danger of being wiped out. The brutal Honored Matres appear to be unstoppable, and there are rumors about their origins. Could they possibly be descended from failed Reverend Mothers, making them the dark side of the Sisterhood? Or could something else be at play, something even more sinister that has been generated in the secret breeding laboratories of the fanatical Tleilaxu?\nHeretics of Dune is a remarkable, cerebral excursion through the most fantastic universe in science fiction. In this novel, as in God Emperor of Dune before it and Chapterhouse: Dune afterward, the author explored layers\nthat he originally interwove into the action of the first novel in the series, Dune—layers containing important messages about politics, religion, ecology, and a host of other interesting, timeless subjects. The last three novels he wrote in the series are intellectually stimulating, and sometimes the action almost seems secondary. Huge battles, and even one that is environmentally catastrophic, occur behind the scenes.\nAs | wrote in Dreamer of Dune, the biography of my father, Heretics of Dune was actually intended to be the first book of a new trilogy that would complete the epic story chronologically. It is set thousands of years in mankind’s future, long after the events in Dune. Before his untimely death in 1986, Frank Herbert wrote the first two books of the trilogy (Heretics and Chapterhouse), but he left the third unwritten. Using my father’s outline and notes, | eventually co-wrote the grand climax with Kevin J. Anderson, but it required two novels for us to do so—Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007).\nHeretics of Dune is the beginning of that extraordinary, climactic adventure, a giant leap"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_17cfdb24ef653b50d75983e008323da33da969fb6c626a1c1a2179baaa0f5d85_v2"}
