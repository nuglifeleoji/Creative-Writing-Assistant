{"prompt_tokens": 8149, "total_tokens": 8149, "completion_tokens": 0}}, "input": {"input": ["Stilgar could only agree that circumstances did change. How must one behave then? He looked beyond Leto, seeing the desert and not seeing it. Muad’Dib had walked there. The flat was a place of golden shadows as the sun climbed, purple shadows, gritty rivulets crested in dust vapors. The dust fog which usually hung over Habbanya Ridge was visible in the far distance now, and the desert between presented his eyes with dunes diminishing, one curve into another. Through the smoky shimmer of heat he saw the plants which crept out from the desert edge. Muad’Dib had caused life to sprout in that desolate place. Copper, gold, red flowers, yellow flowers, rust and russet, grey-green leaves, spikes and harsh shadows beneath bushes. The motion of the day’s heat set shadows quivering, vibrating in the air.\nPresently Stilgar said: “I am only a leader of Fremen; you are the son of a Duke.”\n“Not knowing what you said, you said it,” Leto said.\nStilgar scowled. Once, long ago, Muad’Dib had chided him thus.\n“You remember it, don’t you, Stil?” Leto asked. “We were under Habbanya Ridge and the Sardaukar captain— remember him: Aramsham? He killed his friend to save himself. And you warned several times that day about preserving the lives of Sardaukar who'd seen our secret ways. Finally you said they would surely reveal what they’d seen; they must be killed. And my father said: ‘Not knowing what you said, you said it.’ And you were hurt. You told him you were only a simple leader of Fremen. Dukes must know more important things.”\nStilgar stared down at Leto. We were under Habbanya Ridge! We! This ... this child, not even conceived on that day, knew what had taken place in exact detail, the kind of detail which could only be known to someone who had been there. It was only another proof that these Atreides children could not be judged by ordinary standards.\n“Now you will listen to me,” Leto said. “If | die or disappear in the desert, you are to flee from Sietch Tabr. | command it. You are to take Ghani and—”\n“You are not yet my Duke! You’rea...a child!”\n“I’m an adult in a child’s flesh,” Leto said. He pointed down to a narrow crack in the rocks below them. “If I die here, it will be in that place. You will see the blood. You will know then. Take my sister and—”\n“I’m doubling your guard,” Stilgar said. “You’re not coming out here again. We are leaving now and you—”\n“Stil! You cannot hold me. Turn your mind once more to that time at Habbanya Ridge. Remember? The factory crawler was out there on the sand and a big Maker was coming. There was no way to save the crawler from the worm. And my father was annoyed that he couldn’t save that crawler. But Gurney could think only of the men he’d lost in the sand. Remember what he said: ‘Your father would’ve been more concerned for the men he couldn’t save.’ Stil, | charge you to save people. They’re more\nimportant than things. And Ghani is the most precious of all because, without me, she is the only hope for the Atreides.”\n“I will hear no more,” Stilgar said. He turned and began climbing down the rocks toward the oasis across the sand. He heard Leto following. Presently Leto passed him and, glancing back, said: “Have you noticed, Stil, how beautiful the young women are this year?”\nThe life of a single human, as the life of a family or an entire people, persists as memory. My people must come to see this as part of their maturing process. They are people as organism, and in this persistent memory they store more and more experiences in a subliminal reservoir. Humankind hopes to call upon this material if it is needed for a changing universe. But much that is stored can be lost in that chance play of accident which we call “fate.” Much may not be integrated into evolutionary relationships, and thus may not be evaluated and keyed into activity by those ongoing environmental changes which inflict themselves upon flesh. The species can forget! This is the special value of the Kwisatz Haderach which the Bene Gesserits never suspected: the Kwisatz Haderach cannot forget.\n—THE BOOK OF LETO AFTER HARQ AL-ADA\ntilgar could not explain it, but he found Leto’s casual\nobservation profoundly disturbing. It ground through his awareness all the way back across the sand to Sietch Tabr, taking precedence over everything else Leto had said out there on The Attendant.\nIndeed, the young women of Arrakis were very beautiful that year. And the young men, too. Their faces glowed serenely with water-richness. Their eyes looked outward and far. They exposed their features often without any pretense of stillsuit masks and the snaking lines of catchtubes. Frequently they did not even wear stillsuits in the open, prefering the new garments which, as they moved, offered flickering suggestions of the lithe young bodies beneath.\nSuch human beauty was set off against the new beauty of the landscape. By contrast with the old Arrakis, the eye could be spellbound by its collision with a tiny clump of green twigs growing among red-brown rocks. And the old sietch warrens of the cave-metropolis culture, complete with\nelaborate seals and moisture traps at every entrance, were giving way to open villages built often of mud bricks. Mud bricks!\nWhy did I want the village destroyed? Stilgar wondered, and he stumbled as he walked.\nHe knew himself to be of a dying breed. Old Fremen gasped in wonder at the prodigality of their planet— water wasted into the air for no more than its ability to mold building bricks. The water for a single one-family dwelling would keep an entire sietch alive for a year.\nThe new buildings even had transparent windows to let in the sun’s heat and to desiccate the bodies within. Such windows opened outward.\nNew Fremen within their mud homes could look out upon their landscape. They no longer were enclosed and huddling in a sietch. Where the new vision moved, there also moved the imagination. Stilgar could feel this. The new vision joined Fremen to the rest of the Imperial universe, conditioned them to unbounded space. Once they’d been tied to water-poor Arrakis by their enslavement to its bitter necessities. They’d not shared that open-mindedness which conditioned inhabitants on most planets of the Imperium.\nStilgar could see the changes contrasting with his own doubts and fears. In the old days it had been a rare Fremen who even considered the possibility that he might leave Arrakis to begin a new life on one of the water-rich worlds. They’d not even been permitted the dream of escape.\nHe watched Leto’s moving back as the youth walked ahead. Leto had spoken of prohibitions against movement off-planet. Well, that had always been a reality for most other-worlders, even where the dream was permitted as a safety valve. But planetary serfdom had reached its peak here on Arrakis. Fremen had turned inward, barricaded in their minds as they were barricaded in their cave warrens.\nThe very meaning of sietch—a place of sanctuary in times of trouble—had been perverted here into a monstrous\nconfinement for an entire population.\nLeto spoke the truth: Muad’Dib had changed all that. Stilgar felt lost. He could feel his old beliefs crumbling. The new outward vision produced life which desired to move\naway from containment.\n“How beautiful the young women are this year.”\nThe old ways (My ways! he admitted) had forced his people to ignore all history except that which turned inward onto their own travail. The old Fremen had read history out of their own terrible migrations, their flights from persecution into persecution. The old planetary government had followed the stated policy of the old Imperium. They had suppressed creativity and all sense of progress, of evolution. Prosperity had been dangerous to the old Imperium and its holders of power.\nWith an abrupt shock, Stilgar realized that these things were equally dangerous to the course which Alia was setting.\nAgain Stilgar stumbled and fell farther behind Leto.\nIn the old ways and old religions, there’d been no future, only an endless now. Before Muad’Dib, Stilgar saw, the Fremen had been conditioned to believe in failure, never in the possibility of accomplishment. Well . . . they’d believed Liet-Kynes, but he’d set a forty-generation timescale. That was no accomplishment; that was a dream which, he saw now, had also turned inward.\nMuad’Dib had changed that!\nDuring the Jihad, Fremen had learned much about the old Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. The eighty-first Padishah of House Corrino to occupy the Golden Lion Throne and reign over this Imperium of uncounted worlds had used Arrakis as a testing place for those policies which he hoped to implement in the rest of his empire. His planetary governors on Arrakis had cultivated a persistent pessimism to bolster their power base. They’d made sure that everyone on Arrakis, even the free-roaming Fremen, became familiar\nwith numerous cases of injustice and insoluble problems; they had been taught to think of themselves as a helpless people for whom there was no succor.\n“How beautiful the young women are this year!”\nAs he watched Leto’s retreating back, Stilgar began to wonder how the youth had set these thoughts flowing—and just by uttering a seemingly simple statement. Because of that statement, Stilgar found himself viewing Alia and his own role on the Council in an entirely different way.\nAlia was fond of saying that old ways gave ground slowly. Stilgar admitted to himself that he’d always found this statement vaguely reassuring. Change was dangerous. Invention must be suppressed. Individual willpower must be denied. What other function did the priesthood serve than to deny individual will?\nAlia kept saying that opportunities for open competition had to be reduced to manageable limits. But that meant the recurrent threat of technology could only be used to confine populations—just as it had served its ancient masters. Any permitted technology had to be rooted in ritual. Otherwise... otherwise...\nAgain Stilgar stumbled. He was at the qanat now and saw Leto waiting beneath the apricot orchard which grew along the flowing water. Stilgar heard his feet moving through uncut grass.\nUncut grass!\nWhat can I believe? Stilgar asked himself.\nIt was proper for a Fremen of his generation to believe that individuals needed a profound sense of their own limitations. Traditions were surely the most controlling element in a secure society. People had to know the boundaries of their time, of their society, of their territory. What was wrong with the sietch as a model for all thinking? A sense of enclosure should pervade every individual choice —should fence in the family, the community, and every step taken by a proper government.\nStilgar came to a stop and stared across the orchard at Leto. The youth stood there, regarding him with a smile.\nDoes he know the turmoil in my head? Stilgar wondered.\nAnd the old Fremen Naib tried to fall back on the traditional catechism of his people. Each aspect of life required a single form, its inherent circularity based on secret inner knowledge of what will work and what will not work. The model for life, for the community, for every element of the larger society right", " Fremen of his generation to believe that individuals needed a profound sense of their own limitations.

The giant sandworm was Surely a most formidable creature, but when threatened it hid in the impenetrable deeps.\nChange is dangerous! Stilgar told himself. Sameness and stability were the proper goals of government.\nBut the young men and women were beautiful.\nAnd they remembered the words of Muad’Dib as he deposed Shaddam IV: “It’s not long life to the Emperor that | seek; it’s long life to the Imperium.”\nIsn't that what I’ve been saying to myself? Stilgar wondered.\nHe resumed walking, headed toward the sietch entrance Slightly to Leto’s right. The youth moved to intercept him.\nMuad’Dib had said another thing, Stilgar reminded himself: “Just as individuals are born, mature, breed, and die, so do societies and civilizations and governments.”\nDangerous or not, there would be change. The beautiful young Fremen knew this. They could look outward and see it, prepare for it.\nStilgar was forced to stop. It was either that or walk right over Leto.\nThe youth peered up at him owlishly, said: “You see, Stil? Tradition isn’t the absolute guide you thought it was.”\nA Fremen dies when he is too long from the desert; this we call “the water sickness.”\n—STILGAR, THE COMMENTARIES\n44 | tis difficult for me, asking you to do this,” Alia said. “But... I must insure that there’s an empire for Paul’s children to inherit. There’s no other reason for the Regency.”\nAlia turned from where she was seated at a mirror completing her morning toilet. She looked at her husband, measuring how he absorbed these words. Duncan Idaho deserved careful study in these moments; there was no doubt that he’d become something far more subtle and dangerous than the one-time swordmaster of House Atreides. The outer appearance remained similar—the black goat hair over sharp dark features—but in the long years since his awakening from the ghola state he had undergone an inner metamorphosis.\nShe wondered now, as she had wondered many times, what the ghola rebirth-after-death might have hidden in the secret loneliness of him. Before the Tleilaxu had worked their subtle science on him, Duncan’s reactions had borne clear labels for the Atreides—loyalty, fanatic adherence to the moral code of his mercenary forebears, swift to anger and swift to recover. He had been implacable in his resolve for revenge against House Harkonnen. And he had died saving Paul. But the Tleilaxu had bought his body from the Sardaukar and, in their regeneration vats, they had grown a zombie- katrundo: the flesh of Duncan Idaho, but none of his conscious memories. He’d been trained as a mentat and sent as a gift, a human computer for Paul, a fine tool\nequipped with a hypnotic compulsion to slay his owner. The flesh of Duncan Idaho had resisted that compulsion and, in the intolerable stress, his cellular past had come back to him.\nAlia had decided long ago that it was dangerous to think of him as Duncan in the privacy of her thoughts. Better to think of him by his ghola name, Hayt. Far better. And it was essential that he get not the slightest glimpse of the old Baron Harkonnen sitting there in her mind.\nDuncan saw Alia studying him, turned away. Love could not hide the changes in her, nor conceal from him the transparency of her motives. The many-faceted metal eyes which the Tleilaxu had given him were cruel in their ability to penetrate deception. They limned her now as a gloating, almost masculine figure, and he could not stand to see her thus.\n“Why do you turn away?” Alia asked.\n“I must think about this thing,” he said. “The Lady Jessica is...an Atreides.”\n“And your loyalty is to House Atreides, not to me,” Alia pouted.\n“Don’t put such fickle interpretations into me,” he said.\nAlia pursed her lips. Had she moved too rapidly?\nDuncan crossed to the chambered opening which looked down on a corner of the Temple plaza. He could see pilgrims beginning to gather there, the Arrakeen traders moving in to feed on the edges like a pack of predators upon a herd of beasts. He focused on a particular group of tradesmen, spice-fiber baskets over their arms, Fremen mercenaries a pace behind them. They moved with a stolid force through the gathering throng.\n“They sell pieces of etched marble,” he said, pointing. “Did you know that? They set the pieces out in the desert to be etched by stormsands. Sometimes they find interesting patterns in the stone. They call it a new art form, very popular: genuine storm-etched marble from Dune. | bought\na piece of it last week—a golden tree with five tassels, lovely but very fragile.”\n“Don’t change the subject,” Alia said.\n“I haven’t changed the subject,” he said. “It’s beautiful, but it’s not art. Humans create art by their own violence, by their own volition.” He put his right hand on the windowsill. “The twins detest this city and I’m afraid | see their point.”\n“I fail to see the association,” Alia said. “The abduction of my mother is not a real abduction. She will be safe as your Captive.”\n“This city was built by the blind,” he said. “Did you know that Leto and Stilgar went out from Sietch Tabr into the desert last week? They were gone the whole night.”\n“It was reported to me,” she said. “These baubles from the sand—would you have me prohibit their sale?”\n“That'd be bad for business,” he said, turning. “Do you know what Stilgar said when | asked why they went out on the sand that way? He said Leto wished to commune with the spirit of Muad’Dib.”\nAlia felt the sudden coldness of panic, looked in the mirror a moment to recover. Leto would not venture from the sietch at night for such nonsense. Was it a conspiracy?\nIdaho put a hand over his eyes to blot out the sight of her, said: “Stilgar told me he went along with Leto because he still believes in Muad’Dib.”\n“Of course he does!”\nIdaho chuckled, a hollow sound. “He said he still believes because Muad’Dib was always for the little people.”\n“What did you say to that?” Alia asked, her voice betraying her fear.\nIdaho dropped his hand from his eyes. “I said, ‘That must make you one of the little people.’”\n“Duncan! That’s a dangerous game. Bait that Fremen Naib and you could awaken a beast to destroy us all.”\n“He still believes in Muad’Dib,” Idaho said. “That’s our protection.”\n“What was his reply?”\n“He said he knew his own mind.”\n“| see.”\n“No ...1 don’t believe you do. Things that bite have longer teeth than Stilgar’s.”\n“| don’t understand you today, Duncan. | ask you to do a very important thing, a thing vital to. . . What is all of this rambling?”\nHow petulant she sounded. He turned back to the chambered window. “When I was trained as a mentat... It is very difficult, Alia, to learn how to work your own mind. You learn first that the mind must be allowed to work itself. That’s very strange. You can work your own muscles, exercise them, strengthen them, but the mind acts of itself. Sometimes, when you have learned this about the mind, it shows you things you do not want to see.”\n“And that’s why you tried to insult Stilgar?”\n“Stilgar doesn’t know his own mind; he doesn’t let it run free.”\n“Except in the spice orgy.”\n“Not even there. That’s what makes him a Naib. To be a leader of men, he controls and limits his reactions. He does what is expected of him. Once you know this, you know Stilgar and you can measure the length of his teeth.”\n“That’s the Fremen way,” she said. “Well, Duncan, will you do it, or won’t you? She must be taken and it must be made to look like the work of House Corrino.”\nHe remained silent, weighing her tone and arguments in his mentat way. This abduction plan spoke of a coldness and a cruelty whose dimensions, thus revealed, shocked him. Risk her own mother’s life for the reasons thus far produced? Alia was lying. Perhaps the whisperings about Alia and Javid were true. This thought produced an icy hardness in his stomach.\n“You're the only one I can trust for this,” Alia said.\n“I know that,” he said.\nShe took this as acceptance, smiled at herself in the mirror.\n“You know,” Idaho said, “the mentat learns to look at every human as a series of relationships.”\nAlia did not respond. She sat, caught in a personal memory which drew a blank expression on her face. Idaho, glancing over his shoulder at her, saw the expression and shuddered. It was as though she communed with voices heard only by herself.\n“Relationships,” he whispered.\nAnd he thought: One must cast off old agonies as a snake casts off its skin—only to grow a new set and accept all of their limitations. It was the same with governments—even the Regency. Old governments can be traced like discarded molts. | must carry out this scheme, but not in the way Alia commands.\nPresently Alia shook her shoulders, said: “Leto should not be going out like that in these times. | will reprimand him.”\n“Not even with Stilgar?”\n“Not even with him.”\nShe arose from her mirror, crossed to where Idaho stood beside the window, put a hand on his arm.\nHe repressed a shiver, reduced this reaction to a mentat computation. Something in her revolted him.\nSomething in her.\nHe could not bring himself to look at her. He smelled the melange of her cosmetics, cleared his throat.\nShe said: “I will be busy today examining Farad’n’s gifts.”\n“The clothing?”\n“Yes. Nothing he does is what it seems. And we must remember that his Bashar, Tyekanik, is an adept of chaumurky, chaumas, and all the other subtleties of royal assassination.”\n“The price of power,” he said, pulling away from her. “But we’re still mobile and Farad’n is not.”\n", " “Leto should not be going out like that in these times. | will reprimand him.”\n“Not even with Stilgar?”\n“Not even with him.”\nShe arose from her mirror, crossed to where Idaho stood beside the window, put a hand on his arm.\nHe repressed a shiver, reduced this reaction to a mentat computation.

Sometimes the workings of his mind were difficult to fathom. Was he thinking only that freedom of action gave life to a military power? Well, life on Arrakis had been too secure for too long. Senses once whetted by omnipresent dangers could degenerate when not used.\n“Yes,” she said, “we still have the Fremen.”\n“Mobility,” he repeated. “We cannot degenerate into infantry. That’d be foolish.”\nHis tone annoyed her, and she said: “Farad’n will use any means to destroy us.”\n“Ahhh, that’s it,” he said. “That’s a form of initiative, a mobility which we didn’t have in the old days. We had a code, the code of House Atreides. We always paid our way and let the enemy be the pillagers. That restriction no longer holds, of course. We’re equally mobile, House Atreides and House Corrino.”\n“We abduct my mother to save her from harm as much as for any other reason,” Alia said. “We still live by the code!”\nHe looked down at her. She knew the dangers of inciting a mentat to compute. Didn’t she realize what he had computed? Yet... he still loved her. He brushed a hand across his eyes. How youthful she looked. The Lady Jessica was correct: Alia gave the appearance of not having aged a day in their years together. She still possessed the soft features of her Bene Gesserit mother, but her eyes were Atreides—measuring, demanding, hawklike. And now something possessed of cruel calculation lurked behind those eyes.\nIdaho had served House Atreides for too many years not to understand the family’s strengths as well as their weaknesses. But this thing in Alia, this was new. The Atreides might play a devious game against enemies, but never against friends and allies, and not at all against Family. It was ground into the Atreides manner: support your own populace to the best of your ability; show them how\nmuch better they lived under the Atreides. Demonstrate your love for your friends by the candor of your behavior with them. What Alia asked now, though, was not Atreides. He felt this with all of his body’s flesh and nerve structure. He was a unit, indivisible, feeling this alien attitude in Alia.\nAbruptly his mentat sensorium clicked into full awareness and his mind leaped into the frozen trance where Time did not exist; only the computation existed. Alia would recognize what had happened to him, but that could not be helped. He gave himself up to the computation.\nComputation: A reflected Lady Jessica lived out a pseudo- life in Alia’s awareness. He saw this as he saw the reflected pre-ghola Duncan Idaho which remained a constant in his own awareness. Alia had this awareness by being one of the pre-born. He had it out of the Tleilaxu regeneration tanks. Yet Alia denied that reflection, risked her mother’s life. Therefore Alia was not in contact with that pseudo-Jessica within. Therefore Alia was completely possessed by another pseudo-life to the exclusion of all others.\nPossessed!\nAlien!\nAbomination!\nMentat fashion, he accepted this, turned to other facets of his problem. All of the Atreides were on this one planet. Would House Corrino risk attack from space? His mind flashed through the review of those conventions which had ended primitive forms of warfare:\nOne—All planets were vulnerable to attack from space; ergo: retaliation/revenge facilities were set up off-planet by every House Major. Farad’n would know that the Atreides had not omitted this elementary precaution.\nTwo—Force shields were a complete defense against projectiles and explosives of non-atomic type, the basic reason why hand-to-hand conflict had reentered human combat. But infantry had its limits. House Corrino might have brought their Sardaukar back to a pre-Arrakeen edge,\nbut they still could be no match for the abandoned ferocity of Fremen.\nThree—Planetary feudalism remained in constant danger from a large technical class, but the effects of the Butlerian Jihad continued as a damper on technological excesses. Ixians, Tleilaxu, and a few scattered outer planets were the only possible threat in this regard, and they were planet- vulnerable to the combined wrath of the rest of the Imperium. The Butlerian Jihad would not be undone. Mechanized warfare required a large technical class. The Atreides Imperium had channeled this force into other pursuits. No large technical class existed unwatched. And the Empire remained safely feudalist, naturally, since that was the best social form for spreading over widely dispersed wild frontiers—new planets.\nDuncan felt his mentat awareness coruscate as it shot through memory data of itself, completely impervious to the passage of time. Arriving at the conviction that House Corrino would not risk an ///ega/ atomic attack, he did this in flash-computation, the main decisional pathway, but he was perfectly aware of the elements which went into this conviction: The Imperium commanded as many nuclear and allied weapons as all the Great Houses combined. At least half the Great Houses would react without thinking if House Corrino broke the Convention. The Atreides off-planet retaliation system would be joined by overwhelming force, and no need to summon any of them. Fear would do the calling. Salusa Secundus and its allies would vanish in hot clouds. House Corrino would not risk such a holocaust. They were undoubtedly sincere in subscribing to the argument that nuclear weapons were a reserve held for one purpose: defense of humankind should a threatening “other intelligence” ever be encountered.\nThe computational thoughts had clean edges, sharp relief. There were no blurred between-places. Alia chose abduction and terror because she had become alien, non-Atreides.\nHouse Corrino was a threat, but not in the ways which Alia argued in Council. Alia wanted the Lady Jessica removed because that searing Bene Gesserit intelligence had seen what only now had become clear to him.\nIdaho shook himself out of the mentat trance, saw Alia standing in front of him, a coldly measuring expression on her face.\n“Wouldn’t you rather the Lady Jessica were killed?” he asked.\nThe alien-flash of her joy lay exposed before his eyes for a brief instant before being covered by false outrage. “Duncan!”\nYes, this alien-Alia preferred matricide.\n“You are afraid of your mother, not forher,” he said.\nShe spoke without a change in her measuring stare. “Of course | am. She has reported about me to the Sisterhood.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Don’t you know the greatest temptation for a Bene Gesserit?” She moved closer to him, seductive, looked upward at him through her lashes. “I thought only to keep myself strong and alert for the sake of the twins.”\n“You speak of temptation,” he said, his voice mentat-flat. “It’s the thing which the Sisterhood hides most deeply, the thing they most fear. It’s why they call me Abomination. They know their inhibitions won’t hold me back. Temptation\n—they always speak with heavy emphasis: Great Temptation. You see, we who employ the Bene Gesserit teachings can influence such things as the internal adjustment of enzyme balance within our bodies. It can prolong youth—far longer than with melange. Do you see the consequences should many Bene Gesserits do this? It would be noticed. I’m sure you compute the accuracy of what I’m saying. Melange is what makes us the target for so many plots. We control a substance which prolongs life. What if it became known that Bene Gesserits controlled an even more potent secret? You see! Not one Reverend\nMother would be safe. Abduction and torture of Bene Gesserits would become a most common activity.”\n“You've accomplished this enzyme balancing.” It was a statement, not a question.\n“I’ve defied the Sisterhood! My mother’s reports to the Sisterhood will make the Bene Gesserits unswerving allies of House Corrino.”\nHow very plausible, he thought.\nHe tested: “But surely your own mother would not turn against you!”\n“She was Bene Gesserit long before she was my mother. Duncan, she permitted her own son, my brother, to undergo the test of the gom jabbar! She arranged it! And she knew he might not survive it! Bene Gesserits have always been Short on faith and long on pragmatism. She'll act against me if she believes it’s in the best interests of the Sisterhood.”\nHe nodded. How convincing she was. It was a sad thought.\n“We must hold the initiative,” she said. “That’s our sharpest weapon.”\n“There’s the problem of Gurney Halleck,” he said. “Do | have to kill my old friend?”\n“Gurney’s off on some spy errand in the desert,” she said, knowing Idaho already was aware of this. “He’s safely out of the way.”\n“Very odd,” he said, “the Regent Governor of Caladan running errands here on Arrakis.”\n“Why not?” Alia demanded. “He’s her lover—in his dreams if not in fact.”\n“Yes, of course.” And he wondered that she did not hear the insincerity in his voice.\n“When will you abduct her?” Alia asked.\n“It’s better that you don’t know.”\n“Yes... yes, | see. Where’ll you take her?”\n“Where she cannot be found. Depend upon it; she won’t be left here to threaten you.”\nThe glee in Alia’s eyes could not be mistaken. “But where will...”\n“If you do not know, then you can answer before a Truthsayer, if necessary, that you do not know where she is.”\n“Ahhh, clever, Duncan.”\nNow she believes I will kill the Lady Jessica, he thought. And he said: “Goodbye, beloved.”\nShe did not hear the finality in his voice, even kissed him lightly as he left.\nAnd all the way down through the sietchlike maze of Temple corridors, Idaho brushed at his eyes. Tleilaxu eyes were not immune to tears.\nYou have loved Caladan And lamented its lost host— But pain discovers New lovers cannot erase Those forever ghost.\n—REFRAIN FROM THE HABBANYA LAMENT\ntilgar quadrupled the sietch guard around the twins, but\nhe knew it was useless. The lad was like his Atreides namesake, the grandfather Leto. Everyone who'd known the original Duke remarked on it. Leto had the measuring look about him, and caution, yes, but all of it had to be evaluated against that latent wildness, the susceptibility to dangerous decisions.\nG"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_dd2bbc2df2c224215a59cf6b43a5e02cbbd777a6d5b878d24e2a518f3ee50120_v2"}
