You can plumb us by our language—the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone try chaumurky tonight—poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas—poison in the food?\nHe shook his head.\nBeside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.\nFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.\nHow typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach.\n“The custom stops here!” he muttered.\nHe saw a serving woman—one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended— hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She\nmoved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue- within-blue eyes.\n“My Lord wishes?” She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.\nHe gestured. “Have these basins and towels removed.”\n“But...Noble Born....” She looked up, mouth gaping.\n“I know the custom!” he barked. “Take these basins to the front door. While we’re eating and until we've finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water. Understood?”\nHer leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger....\nWith sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.\nHis face clouded, and he growled: “I’m posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter.”\nHe whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water and waves—days of grass instead of sand —dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves.\nAll gone.\nI’m getting old, he thought. /’ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman’s greed.\nIn the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard- faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various Smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.\nMost of the women in the hall seemed cast from a Specific type—decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.\nEven without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors—a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.\nHe realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades —that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.\nNearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat— “Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance.”\nThe Duke glanced around the room.\nThere was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.\nHe’ll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.\nPaul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts—voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast.\n/’m in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.\nHe knew his mood’s source. He hadn’t wanted to attend this function, but his father had been firm. “You have a place—a position to uphold. You're old enough to do this. You’re almost a man.”\nPaul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.\nAs Leto approached Jessica’s group, the water- shipper was asking: “Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?”\nFrom behind the man, the Duke said: “We haven’t gone that far in our thinking, sir.”\nThe man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. “Ah-h, the Duke,” he said. “We missed you.”\nLeto glanced at Jessica. “A thing needed doing.” He returned his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: “As far as I’m concerned, the old custom ends now.”\n“Is this a ducal order, m’Lord?” the man asked.\n“| leave that to your own...ah...conscience,” the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.\nOne of the women said: “I think it’s a very generous gesture—giving water to the—” Someone shushed her.\nThe Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.\nThe water-shipper asked in an angry voice: “Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?”\n“This custom has been changed,” Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica’s face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it'll increase rumors of friction between us.\n“With the Duke’s permission,” the water-shipper said, “I'd like to inquire further about customs.”\nLeto heard the sudden oily tone in the man’s voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room.\n“Isn’t it almost time for dinner?” Jessica asked.\n“But our guest has some questions,” Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round- faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling Hawat’s memorandum: “...and this water-shipper Is a man to watch—Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him.”\n“Water customs are so interesting,” Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face. “I’m curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people’s faces...m’Lord?”\nLeto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewt’s signature over a contract of allegiance. The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal.... The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.\n“My Lord, the Duke, and | have other plans for our conservatory,” Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. “We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.”\nBless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.\n“Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,” the Duke said. “I’d advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.”\nAnd he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt’s organization. And we must start on standby water facilities at once. No man Is going to hold a club over my head!\nBewt nodded, the smile still on his face. “A commendable dream, my Lord.” He withdrew a pace.\nLeto’s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes’ face. The man was Staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured—like a man in love...or caught in a religious trance.\nKynes’ thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: “And they shall share your most precious dream.” He spoke directly to Jessica: “Do you bring the shortening of the way?”\n“Ah, Dr. Kynes,” the water-shipper said. “You’ve come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.”\nKynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: “It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.”\n“They have many strange sayings in the desert,” Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.\nJessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: “...the shortening of the way.” In the old\ntongue, the phrase translated as “Kwisatz Haderach.” The planetologist’s odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.\nKwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: “Many people have sought to change Arrakis.”\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b2b3e97667628cc5954d8834019c0fb220ec59e2eb331a48f7f777ed643b36d4_v2"}
