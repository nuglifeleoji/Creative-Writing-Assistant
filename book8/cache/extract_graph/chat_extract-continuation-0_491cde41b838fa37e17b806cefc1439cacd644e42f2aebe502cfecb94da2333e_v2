��，但也是真龙之属。蓝潇兄你是研究古魂兽的，所以应该很清楚龙类武魂在武魂之中的地位。那绝对是最高层次的存在。所以，在轩宇身上出现的情况意味着什么不言而喻。他的武魂变异，要么和龙类有关，并且是更高层次的龙类武魂，要么，就是另外的强大武魂。或许现在还没开发出来，但那武魂气息是假不了的。”\n\n    “我详细询问了灵瞳几次和轩宇交手的情况，几乎可以肯定，他的变异武魂是相当了不得的。既然你的儿子有这样的天赋，怎能埋没呢？”\n\n    蓝潇道：“没有要埋没啊！这次开学之后，他们就要考天罗学院的高能少年班了吧。也不知道能不能考上。”\n\n    叶锋眼含深意的道：“其实还有另外一种方向。不一定非要走魂师学院这条路。如果你同意的话，我可以帮他进入军方体系，进入军校直接培养。未来的发展方向甚至可以朝着战神殿的方向努力。”\n\n    “战神殿？”听到这三个字，蓝潇不禁身体一震。他当然知道那是怎样的存在。\n\n    战神殿隶属于联邦直管，但也是军方的一部分，乃是军方最强者的聚集地。任何一位能够被称之为战神的存在，在军方都有着举足轻重的地位。至少也是少将军衔。但想要成为战神可决非容易的事情。按照战神殿的规矩，最多就只能拥有十八位战神，预备战神就不知道有多少了。想要成为真正的战神，预备战神就需要通过挑战战神并且战而胜之才行。\n\n    而这谈何容易？\n\n    但是，一旦成功，那可就是康庄大道。战神殿体系可是军方的捷径。\n\n    叶锋点了点头，“没错，我觉得轩宇有这个潜质。灵瞳都未必行，但他应该有机会。蓝潇兄……”\n\n    蓝潇却在这时毫不犹豫的摇了摇头，“不了。”\n\n    “嗯？”叶锋没想到他拒绝的如此之快。\n\n    蓝潇道：“如果进入军方体系，就意味着这孩子将会离开我们身边，我和他妈妈都舍不得。所以，还是让他按照正常学院的道路去走吧。”\n\n    叶锋眉头紧蹙，“雏鹰不放出去，如何展翅高飞？蓝潇兄，你不能如此短视啊？”\n\n    蓝潇轻叹一声，“不是我短视，实在是经过了分离之后，才明白这份痛苦有多么强烈。我最近刚参与了星际探索，一走就是八个月。具体做什么我不能说。但这八个月来，对我、对他们母子都是极大的煎熬。在我们看来，没有什么比一家团聚更重要的事情了。”\n\n    叶锋没想到他会这么说，但也下意识的回想起自己在关禁闭的那段时间，心中所思所想又何尝不是妻女呢？\n\n    轻叹一声，“好吧。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>蓝潇<|>PERSON<|>蓝潇 is a character who is knowledgeable about ancient soul beasts and is
