Alterations in Guild design were visible: a long façade of windows, much exotic wood and jeweled stones.\nWealth.\nShe was dealing with wealth in an extreme it would be hard for some to imagine. Nothing Dama wanted, nothing that could be provided by the society subservient to her, would be denied. Nothing except freedom to go back into the Scattering.\nHow firmly did Dama cling to the fantasy that her exile might end? And what was the force that had driven such power back to the Old Empire? Why here? Odrade dared not ask.\n“We will continue this in my quarters,” Dama said.\nInto the Spider Queen’s lair at last!\nDama’s quarters were a bit of a puzzle. Richly carpeted floors. She kicked off sandals and went barefoot on entering. Odrade followed this lead.\nLook at the callused flesh along the outsides of her feet! Dangerous weapons kept well-conditioned.\nNot the soft floor but the room itself puzzled Odrade. One Small window looking over the carefully manicured botanical garden. No hangings or pictures on the walls. No decorations. An air vent grill drew shadowy stripes above the door they had entered. One other door on the right. Another air vent. Two soft gray couches. Two small side tables in glistening black. Another larger table in tones of gold with a green shimmer above it to indicate a control field. Odrade identified the fine rectangular outline of a projector inset into the golden table.\nAhhhh, this ts her workroom. Are we here to work?\nA refined concentration about this place. Care had been taken to eliminate distractions. What distractions would Dama accept?\nWhere are the decorated rooms? She has to live in particular ways with her surroundings. You cannot always be\nforming mental barriers to reject things around you that sit disagreeably in your psyche. If you want real comfort, your home cannot be set up in a way that attacks you, especially no attacks on the unconscious side. She is aware of unconscious vulnerabilities! This one is truly dangerous but she has the power to say “Yes.”\nIt was an ancient Bene Gesserit insight. You looked for the ones who could say “Yes.” Never bother with underlings who can only say “No.” You sought the one who could make an agreement, sign a contract, pay off on a promise. Spider Queen did not often say “Yes” but she had that power and knew it.\n| should have realized when she took me aside. She sent me the first signal when she permitted me to call her Dama. Have | been too precipitate, setting up Teg’s attack in a way | cannot stop? Too late for second thoughts. | knew it when | unleashed him.\nBut what other forces may we attract?\nOdrade had Dama’s dominance pattern registered. Words and gestures were likely to make Spider Queen recoil, crouching back to intense awareness of her own heartbeats.\nThe drama must go forward.\nDama was doing something with her hands in the green field atop the golden table. She concentrated on it, ignoring Odrade in a way that was both insult and compliment.\nYou will not interfere, witch, because that is not in your best interest and you know it. Besides, you are not important enough to distract me.\nDama appeared agitated.\nHas the attack on Gammu been successful? Are refugees beginning to arrive?\nAn orange glare focused on Odrade. “Your pilot has just destroyed himself and your ship rather than submit to our inspection. What did you bring?”\n“Ourselves.”\n“There is a signal coming from you!”\n“Telling my companions whether | am alive or dead. You already knew that. Some of our ancestors burned their ships before an attack. No retreat possible.”\nOdrade spoke with exquisite care, tone and timing adjusted to Dama’s responses. “If | am successful, you will provide my transport. My pilot was a Cyborg and shere could not protect him from your probes. His orders were to kill himself rather than fall into your hands.”\n“Providing us with coordinates to your planet.” The orange subsided from Dama’s eyes, but she still was disturbed. “I did not think your people obeyed you to that extent.”\nHow do you hold them without sexual bonding, witch? Is the answer not obvious? We have secret powers.\nCareful now, Odrade cautioned herself. A methodical approach, alert for new demands. Let her think we choose one method of response and stick to it. How much does she know about us? She does not know that even Mother Superior may be only a morsel of bait, a lure to gain vital information. Does that make us superior? If so, can superior training surmount superior soeed and numbers?\nOdrade had no answer.\nDama seated herself behind the golden table, leaving Odrade standing. There was a nesting sense about the movement. She did not leave this place often. This was the true center of her web. All things she thought she needed were here. She had brought Odrade to this room because it was an inconvenience to be elsewhere. She was uncomfortable in other settings, perhaps even felt threatened. Dama did not court danger. She had done so once but that was long ago, shut off behind her somewhere. Now, she wanted only to sit here in a safe and well- organized cocoon where she could manipulate others.\nOdrade found these observations a welcome affirmation of Bene Gesserit deductions. The Sisterhood knew how to exploit this leverage.\n“Have you nothing more to say?” Dama asked.\nStall for time.\nOdrade ventured a question. “I am extremely curious why you agreed to this meeting?”\n“Why are you curious?”\n“It seems so... so out of character for you.”\n“We determine what is in character for us!” Quite testy there.\n“But what is it about us interests you?”\n“You think we find you interesting?”\n“Perhaps you even find us remarkable, because that is certainly how we look at you.”\nA pleased expression made its fleeting appearance on Dama’s face. “I knew you would be fascinated by us.”\n“The exotic interests the exotic,” Odrade said.\nThis brought a knowing smile to Dama’s lips, the smile of someone whose pet has been clever. She stood and went to the one window. Summoning Odrade to her side, Dama gestured to a stand of trees beyond the first flowering bushes and spoke in that soft accent so difficult to follow.\nSomething ticked off an inner alarm. Odrade fell into simulflow, seeking the source. Something in the room or in Spider Queen? There was a lack of spontaneity about the setting matched by much that Dama did. So all of this was designed to create an effect. Carefully schemed.\nIs this one really my Spider Queen? Or is there a more powerful one watching us?\nOdrade explored this thought, sorting swiftly. It was a process that provided more questions than answers, a mental shorthand akin to that of Mentats. Sort for relevance and bring up the latent (but orderly) backgrounds. Order generally was a product of human activity. Chaos existed as raw material from which to create order. That was the Mentat approach, giving no unalterable truths but a remarkable lever for decision-making: orderly assemblage of data in a non-discrete system.\nShe arrived at a Projective.\nThey revel in chaos! Prefer it! Adrenaline addicts!\nSo Dama was Dama, Great Honored Matre. Forever the patroness, forever the superior.\nThere is no greater one watching us. But Dama believes this is bargaining. One would think she had never done it before. Precisely!\nDama touched an unmarked place below the window and the wall folded back, revealing that the window was but an artful projection. The way was opened onto a high balcony paved with dark green tiles. It overlooked plantations much different from those in the window projection. Here was chaos preserved, wilderness left to its own devices and made more remarkable by ordered gardens in the distance. Brambles, fallen trees, thick bushes. And beyond: evenly spaced rows of what appeared to be vegetables with automated harvesters passing back and forth, leaving bare ground behind them.\nLove of chaos, indeed!\nSpider Queen smiled and led the way onto the balcony.\nAs she emerged, Odrade once more was stopped by what she saw. A decoration on the parapet to her left. A life-size figure shaped from an almost ethereal substance, all feathery planes and curved surfaces.\nWhen she squinted at the figure, Odrade saw it was intended to represent a human. Male or female? In some positions male, and in some female. Planes and curves responded to vagrant breezes. Thin, almost invisible wires (looked to be shigawire) suspended it from a delicately curving tube anchored in a translucent mound. The lower extremities of the figure almost touched the pebbled surface of the supporting base.\nOdrade stared, captivated.\nWhy does it remind me of Sheeana’s “The Void”?\nWhen the wind moved it, the whole creation appeared to dance, relapsing sometimes into a graceful walk, then a\nslow pirouette and sweeping turns with outstretched leg.\n“It is called ‘Ballet Master,’” Dama said. “In some winds it will kick its feet high. | have seen it running as gracefully as a marathoner. Sometimes it is just ugly little motions, arms jerking as though they held weapons. Beautiful and ugly—it is all the same. I think the artist misnamed it. ‘Being Unknown’ would have been better.”\nBeautiful and ugly—all the same. Being Unknown.\nThat was a terrible thing about Sheena’s creation. Odrade felt a cold wash of fear. “Who was the artist?”\n“I’ve no idea. One of my predecessors took it from a planet we were destroying. Why does it interest you?”\nIt’s the wild thing no one can govern. But she said: “| presume we're both seeking a basis for understanding, trying to find similarities between us.”\nThis brought the orange glare. “You may try to understand us but we have no need to understand you.”\n“Both of us come from societies of women.”\n“It is dangerous to think of us as your offshoots!”\nBut Murbella’s evidence says you are. Formed in the Scattering by Fish Speakers and Reverend Mothers in extremis.\nAll ingenuous and fooling nobody, Odrade asked: “Why is that dangerous?”\nDama’s laugh conveyed no amusement. Vindictive.\nOdrade experienced an abrupt new assessment of danger. More than a Bene Gesserit probe-and-review was demanded here. These women were accustomed to killing when angered. A reflex. Dama had said as much when speaking to her aide, and Dama had just signaled there were limits to her tolerance.\nYet, in her own way, she is trying to bargain. She displays her mechanical marvels, her powers, her wealth. No offer of alliance. Be willing servants, witches, our slaves, and we will forgive much. To gain the last of the Million Planets? More than that, certainly, but an interesting number.\nWith a new caution, Odrade reformed her approach. Reverend Mothers too easily fell into an adaptive pattern. / am, of course, quite different from you but I will unbend for the sake of accord. That would not do with Honored Matres. They would accept nothing to suggest they were not in absolute control. It was a statement of Dama’s superiority over her Sisters that she allowed Odrade so much latitude.\nOnce more, Dama spoke in her imperious manner.\nOdrade listened. How odd that Spider Queen thought one of the most attractive things the Bene Gesserit could provide was immunity from new diseases.\nWas that the form of attack that drove them\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother engaged in negotiations with Dama, displaying keen observational skills and strategic thinking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAMA<|>PERSON<|>Dama is the Spider Queen, a powerful Honored Matre with extreme wealth and control, negotiating with Odrade but displaying signs of discomfort and agitation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Teg is a military leader whose attack on Gammu was orchestrated by Odrade, though his current status is unknown)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is an artist referenced by Odrade, known for a creation called 'The Void' which resembles Dama's 'Ballet Master' sculpture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a source of evidence suggesting Honored Matres are offshoots of Fish Speakers and Reverend Mothers from the Scattering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful Sisterhood with advanced mental and physical training, engaged in negotiations with Dama)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and chaotic faction led by Dama, possibly originating from the Scattering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD EMPIRE<|>GEO<|>The Old Empire is the region where Dama and other Honored Matres have returned, though their reasons are unclear)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>The Scattering was a mass exodus of people, possibly including the ancestors of the Honored Matres, from which Dama wishes to return)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>Gammu is the location of a military attack orchestrated by Teg under Odrade's orders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALLET MASTER<|>EVENT<|>'Ballet Master' is a kinetic sculpture in Dama's quarters, symbolizing chaos and the unknown, resembling Sheeana's 'The Void')\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRADE<|>DAMA<|>Odrade is negotiating with Dama, probing for weaknesses and attempting to form an alliance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, acting on their behalf in negotiations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Dama is the leader of the Honored Matres, representing their interests in negotiations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRADE<|>TEG<|>Odrade orchestrated Teg's attack on Gammu, though she now questions the timing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade compares Dama's 'Ballet Master' sculpture to Sheeana's 'The Void', suggesting a shared artistic influence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>OLD EMPIRE<|>Dama and the Honored Matres have returned to the Old Empire, though their motives are unclear<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>SCATTERING<|>Dama desires to return to the Scattering, though she is currently exiled<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>GAMMU<|>Teg led an attack on Gammu, possibly to destabilize Honored Matre control<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAMA<|>BALLET MASTER<|>Dama owns the 'Ballet Master' sculpture, which she uses to symbolize chaos and control<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Murbella's evidence suggests the Honored Matres originated from Fish Speakers and Reverend Mothers in the Scattering<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
