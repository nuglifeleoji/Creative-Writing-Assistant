对于个人实力来说，这当然是好事。可是，他真心不希望儿子受到的关注太多。\n\n    蓝银草钻回掌心之中，先前那种和水元素的亲和虽然还在，却淡化了许多。似乎只有让蓝银草附体，才能达到和水元素最强的亲和状态。\n\n    蓝潇走出修炼室，一会儿工夫取回来一个头盔似的仪器，“儿子，爸爸给你再重新测试一下精神力。”\n------------\n\n第二十四章 精神力测试\n\n    人类的精神力早就已经可以通过数据来量化。一名魂师的强弱与否，精神力也是重要的评价方法。尤其是对于那些本身就擅长于精神力的魂师来说。更是如此。\n\n    精神力强弱和自身武魂有直接关系，与武魂品质成正比，通过冥想，在提升魂力的同时可共同提升，伴随着魂灵或魂环附加，可同时拥有。精神修炼方法极其罕见。\n\n    从低到高，精神力层次分为：灵元境、灵通境、灵海境、灵渊境、灵域境和神阶才能拥有的神元境。\n\n    灵元境，一元初始，万象更新，每个人一出生开始，就具备有灵元境的精神力，也是最基础的精神力。灵元境精神力能够承载黄色，包括黄色以下魂灵。\n\n    用数值来衡量的话，零到五十点精神力，都属于灵元境的范畴。而刚刚觉醒武魂不久的蓝轩宇显然是属于这个层次的。\n\n    上次测试的时候，蓝轩宇的精神力是十八点。比普通人自然是强的，但在一环魂师之中，就很普通了。所以他之前对于水元素控制不太好，也是显而易见的。\n\n    蓝潇想看看，伴随着儿子身体出现这种如同解除封印似的变化之后，精神力是不是也有变化。甚至他可以肯定，一定是有变化的，只是要确定变化的程度是多少。\n\n    戴上头盔，开始测试。\n\n    蓝轩宇的眼睛被屏幕遮盖住，屏幕中能够看到一条通道，两旁是高高的森林，而远处尽头似乎有一座小房子。\n\n    “集中精神去看那个房子就行。”虽然不是第一次了，但蓝潇还是提醒了儿子一下。\n\n    蓝轩宇凝神去看，头盔上的数字就随之开始跳动。\n\n    “滴！”一声脆鸣响起，数字飞涨，超过了五十点……\n\n    然后上升速度才开始变得缓慢起来，一直到六十二点才停顿下来。\n\n    蓝潇和南澄面面相觑。从十八点精神力到六十二点精神力，增长四十四点。\n\n    四十四点精神力，对于已经六环修为的南澄来说不算什么。可是，对于一个只有一环的孩子来说，这精神力可就是天才\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
