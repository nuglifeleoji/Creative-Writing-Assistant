A small measure of the Sisterhood’s far- reaching authority could be deduced from the fact that they held this authority despite Tleilaxu tank-grown melange, which had broken the Rakian monopoly on the spice, just as Ixian navigation machines had broken the Guild monopoly on space travel.\nMiles Teg knew his history well by then. Guild Navigators no longer were the only ones who could thread a ship through the folds of space—in this galaxy one instant, ina faraway galaxy the very next heartbeat.\nThe School Sisters held back little from him, revealing there for the first time the fact of his Atreides ancestry. That revelation was necessary because of the tests they gave him. They obviously were testing for prescience. Could he, like a Guild Navigator, detect fatal obstructions? He failed. They tried him next on no-chambers and no-ships. He was as blind to such devices as the rest of humankind. For this test, though, they fed him increased doses of the spice and he sensed the awakening of his True Self.\n“The Mind at Its Beginning,” a teaching Sister called it when he asked for an explanation of this odd sensation.\nFor a time, the universe was magical as he looked at it through this new awareness. His awareness was a Circle, then a globe. Arbitrary forms became transient. He fell into trance state without warning until the Sisters taught him how to control this. They provided him with accounts of saints and mystics and forced him to draw a freehand circle with either hand, following the line with his awareness.\nBy the end of the term, his awareness resumed its touch with conventional labels, but the memory of the magic never left him. He found that memory a source of strength at the most difficult moments.\nAfter accepting the assignment as Weapons Master to the ghola, Teg found his magical memory increasingly with him. It was especially useful during his first interview with Schwangyu at the Keep on Gammu. They met in the Reverend Mother’s study, a place of shiny metal walls and numerous instruments, most of them with the stamp of Ix on them. Even the chair in which she sat, the morning sun coming through a window behind her and making her face difficult to see, even that chair was one of the Ixian self- molders. He was forced to sit in a chairdog, though he realized she must know he detested the use of any life form for such a demeaning task.\n“You were chosen because you actually are a grandfatherly figure,” Schwangyu said. The bright sunlight formed a corona around her hooded head. Deliberate! “Your wisdom will earn the child’s love and respect.”\n“There’s no way | could be a father figure.”\n“According to Taraza, you have the precise characteristics she requires. | know of your honorable scars and their value to us.”\nThis only reconfirmed his previous Mentat summation: They have been planning this for a long time. They have bred for it. | was bred for it. | am part of their larger plan.\nAll he said was: “Taraza expects this child to become a redoubtable warrior when restored to his true self.”\nSchwangyu merely stared at him for a moment, then: “You must not answer any of his questions about gholas, should he encounter the subject. Do not even use the word until | give you permission. We will supply you with all of the ghola data your duties require.”\nColdly parceling out his words for emphasis, Teg said: “Perhaps the Reverend Mother was not informed that | am\nwell versed in the lore of Tleilaxu gholas. | have met Tleilaxu in battle.”\n“You think you know enough about the Idaho series?”\n“The Idahos are reputed to have been brilliant military strategists,” Teg said.\n“Then perhaps the great Bashar was not informed about the other characteristics of our ghola.”\nNo doubt of the mockery in her voice. Something else as well: jealousy and great anger poorly concealed. Teg’s mother had taught him ways of reading through her own masks, a forbidden teaching, which he had always concealed. He feigned chagrin and shrugged.\nIt was obvious, though, that Schwangyu knew he was Taraza’s Bashar. The lines had been drawn.\n“At Bene Gesserit behest,” Schwangyu said, “the Tleilaxu have made a significant alteration in the present Idaho series. His nerve-muscle system has been modernized.”\n“Without changing the original persona?” Teg fed the question to her blandly, wondering how far she would go in revelation.\n“He is a ghola, not a clone!”\n“| see.”\n“Do you really? He requires the most careful prana-bindu training at all stages.”\n“Taraza’s orders exactly,” Teg said. “And we will all obey those orders.”\nSchwangyu leaned forward, not concealing her anger. “You have been asked to train a ghola whose role in certain plans is most dangerous to us all. | don’t think you even remotely understand what you will train!”\nWhat you will train, Teg thought. Not whom. This ghola- child would never be a whom for Schwangyu or any of the others who opposed Taraza. Perhaps the ghola would not be a whom to anyone until restored to his original self, firmly seated in that original Duncan Idaho identity.\nTeg saw clearly now that Schwangyu harbored more than hidden reservations about the ghola project. She was in active opposition just as Taraza had warned. Schwangyu was the enemy and Taraza’s orders had been explicit.\n“You will protect that child against any threat.”\nTen thousand years since Leto II began his metamorphosis from human into the sandworm of Rakis and historians still argue over his motives. Was he driven by the desire for long life? He lived more than ten times the normal span of three hundred SY, but consider the price he paid. Was it the lure of power? He is called the Tyrant for good reason but what did power bring him that a human might want? Was he driven to save humankind from itself? We have only his own words about his Golden Path to answer this and | cannot accept the self-serving records of Dar-es-Balat. Might there have been other gratifications, which only his experiences would illuminate? Without better evidence the question is moot. We are reduced to saying only that “He did it!” The physical fact alone is undeniable.\n—THE METAMORPHOSIS OF LETO II, 10,000TH ANNIVERSARY PERORATION BY GAUS ANDAUD\nO nce more, Waff knew he was on lashkar. This time the stakes were as high as they could go. An Honored Matre from the Scattering demanded his presence. A powindah of powindahs! Descendants of Tleilaxu from the Scattering had told him all they could about these terrible women.\n“Far more terrible than Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit,” they said.\nAnd more numerous, Waff reminded himself.\nHe did not fully trust the returned Tleilaxu descendants, either. Their accents were strange, their manners even stranger and their observances of the rituals questionable. How could they be readmitted to the Great Kehl? What possible rite of ghufran could cleanse them after all these centuries? It was beyond belief that they had kept the Tleilaxu secret down the generations.\nThey were no longer malik-brothers and yet they were the only source of information the Tleilaxu possessed about these returning Lost Ones. And the revelations they had brought! Revelations that had been incorporated in the\nDuncan Idaho gholas—that was worth all of the risks of contamination by powindah evil.\nThe meeting place with the Honored Matres was the presumed neutrality of an Ixian no-ship that held a tight orbit around a mutually selected gas giant planet ina mined-out solar system of the old Imperium. The Prophet himself had drained the last of the wealth from this system. New Face Dancers walked as Ixians among the no-ship’s crew but Waff still sweated the first encounter. If these Honored Matres were truly more terrible than the Bene Gesserit witches, would the exchange of Face Dancers for Ixian crewmen be detected?\nSelection of this meeting place and the arrangements had put a strain on the Tleilaxu. Was it secure? He reassured himself that he carried two sealed weapons never before seen off the Tleilaxu core planets. The weapons were the painstaking result of long effort by his artificers: two minuscule dart throwers concealed in his sleeves. He had trained with them for years until the flipping of the sleeves and the discharge of the poisoned darts was almost an instinctive reflex.\nThe walls of the meeting room were properly copper- toned, evidence that they were shielded from Ixian spy devices. But what instruments might the people of the Scattering have developed beyond the Ixian ken?\nWaff entered the room with a hesitant step. The Honored Matre already was there seated in a leather sling chair.\n“You will call me what everyone else calls me,” she greeted him. “Honored Matre.”\nHe bowed as he had been warned to do. “Honored Matre.”\nNo hint of hidden powers in her voice. A low contralto with overtones that spoke of disdain for him. She looked like an aged athlete or acrobat, slowed and retired but still maintaining her muscle tone and some of her skills. Her face was tight skin over a skull with prominent cheekbones. The\nthin-lipped mouth produced a sense of arrogance when she spoke, as though every word were projected downward onto lesser folk.\n“Well, come in and sit down!” she commanded, waving at a sling chair facing her.\nWaff heard the hatch hiss closed behind him. He was alone with her! She was wearing a snooper. He could see the lead for it going into her left ear. His dart throwers had been sealed and “washed” against snoopers, then maintained at minus 340° Kelvin in a radiation bath for five SY to make them proof against snoopers. Had it been enough?\nGently, he lowered himself into the indicated chair.\nOrange-tinted contact lenses covered the Honored Matre’s eyes, giving them a feral appearance. She was altogether daunting. And her clothing! Red leotards beneath a dark blue cape. The surface of the cape had been decorated with some pearly material to produce strange arabesques and dragon designs. She sat in the chair as though it were a throne, her clawlike hands resting easily on the arms.\nWaff glanced around the room. His people had inspected this place in company with Ixian maintenance workers and representatives of the Honored Matre.\nWe have done our best, he thought, and he tried to relax.\nThe Honored Matre laughed.\nWaff stared at her with as calm an expression as he could muster. “You are gauging me now,” he accused. “You say to yourself that you have enormous resources to employ against me, subtle and gross instruments to carry out your commands.”\n“Do not take that tone with me.” The words were low and flat but carried such a weight of venom that Waff almost recoiled.\nHe stared at the stringy muscles of the woman’s legs, that deep red leotard fabric which flowed over her skin as\nthough it were organic to her.\nTheir meeting time had been adjusted to bring them together at a mutually personal mid-morning, their waking hours having been balanced en route. Waff felt dislocated, though, and at a disadvantage. What if the stories of his informants were true? She must\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES EMPIRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atreides Empire is a powerful political entity in the
