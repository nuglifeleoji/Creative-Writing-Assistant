The Jihad's strict ban on such technology shaped the Bene Gesserit's philosophy, fostering a deep aversion to machines, cyborg enhancements, and advanced automation. This historical context also influenced their distrust of groups like the **Ixians**, who continued to develop advanced technology, prompting the Sisterhood to view them with suspicion.  \n\nFollowing the Jihad, the Bene Gesserit established themselves as a mental-physical training school, honing their members' abilities through rigorous discipline, genetic manipulation, and political acumen. Their reliance on human potential over machine assistance led them to preserve knowledge in **Archives**, as the destruction of thinking machines necessitated alternative methods of record-keeping. The Jihad's legacy deeply ingrained in the Sisterhood a preference for human intellect and biological mastery, reinforcing their role as a shadowy yet dominant force in shaping galactic politics, religion, and eugenics.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—some focusing on their rise to power, others on their ideological foundations—they collectively affirm that the **Butlerian Jihad** was the defining event that shaped the Bene Gesserit's identity, methods, and long-term ambitions. Their strategies, including the **Missionaria Protectiva** and breeding programs, were all influenced by the post-Jihad landscape, where human capability had to replace machine reliance. Thus, the Bene Gesserit remain a testament to the enduring impact of the Jihad, embodying its anti-technological ethos while wielding immense influence through purely human means.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754986116, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 334, "total_tokens": 685, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 270}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
