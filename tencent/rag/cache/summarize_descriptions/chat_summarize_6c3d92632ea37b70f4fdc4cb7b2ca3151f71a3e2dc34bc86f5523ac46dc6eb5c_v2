Many Zensunni Wanderers also regard Poritrin as their planet of origin, underscoring its cultural and historical importance to their traditions. The planet's legacy is deeply tied to the forced displacement of the Fremen, marking it as a symbol of both ancestral heritage and oppression in their collective memory.
