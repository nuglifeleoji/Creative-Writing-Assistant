\n　　棺木两边的长条凳上，老太太的直系亲属轮流坐着守灵。吊唁的人川流不息。亲戚们过一会就轮着来一批，跪在灵棚前唱歌一般哭诉一番，但真正流眼泪的是少数人。哭得最伤心的是大媳妇张桂兰——她多半借此哭自己的命运。 \n　　前来吊唁的村民只是送点香火，烧烧纸；辈数小的跪下磕两个头。 \n　　入葬的前一天，亲戚、金家全族的大人娃娃和所有被邀请的宾客，从早到晚一直不断地轮流吃两顿非吃不可的饭。第一顿是合烙油糕；第二顿是“八碗”和烧酒。隔壁金光亮弟兄三家的窑洞全都摆满了宴席。 \n　　下午，雇用的一班吹鼓手来了——进村以后，先放了一声铳炮。所有的孝子都到村头去跪迎五个穿开花破棉袄的乐人。 \n　　夜幕一降临，隆重的撒路灯仪式开始。吹鼓手前面引路，孝子们一律身穿白孝衣，头戴白孝帽，手拄哭丧棒，真假哭声响成一片；他们跟在吹鼓手后面，从金俊武家的院门里出来，沿着哭咽河边的小路，向金家祖坟那里走去。许多人手里都拿着白面捏成的灯盏，走一段，便往右边的雪地上放一盏，并且随手抛撒着纸钱。返回来时，又向路的另一边间隔搁置面灯。入夜，雪地上的路灯如同流萤一般闪闪烁烁，其阵势蔚为壮观。双水村的老人们纷纷羡慕地议论感叹：金老太太生了个真孝子，把丧事办得多体面啊！ \n　　第二天大出殡以前，又进行了著名的“游食上祭”仪式。全体男女孝子，手拄哭丧棒，披麻戴孝在老太太灵前间隔按辈数跪成方阵。仍然由吹鼓手领路，后跟两个三指托供果盘的村民，在孝子们的方阵中绕着穿行。托盘人为田五和一队原会计田平娃。这两个人左手举盘，右手拿着白毛巾，迈着扭秧歌一般的步伐，轻巧地走着，象是在表演一个节目。接下来是“商话”。一般说来，这是孝子们最心惊的一个关口。这实际上意味着老人能不能顺利入土。 \n　　所谓“商话”，就是由死者娘家的人审问孝子们在老人生前是否对她孝顺；或者她死后的葬礼是否得到尽心操办？这时候，死者娘家门上来的人，哪怕是三岁娃娃，在孝子面前都是权威人士，象君主立宪国的皇室成员，神圣不可侵犯。如果他们中任何一个人从中作梗，孝子们就别\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
