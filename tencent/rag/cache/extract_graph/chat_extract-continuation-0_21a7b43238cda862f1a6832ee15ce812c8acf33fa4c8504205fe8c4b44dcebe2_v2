She felt that if she could only command her body to run, she might escape. She had to escape lest any part of that inner\ntide sweep her into silence, forever contaminating her soul. But her body would not obey. The mightiest forces in the Imperial universe would obey her slightest whim, but her body would not.\nAn inner voice chuckled. Then: “From one viewpoint, child, each incident of creation represents a catastrophe.” It was a basso voice which rumbled against her eyes, and again that chuckle as though deriding its own pontification. “My dear child, | will help you, but you must help me in return.”\nAgainst the swelling background clamor behind that basso voice, Alia spoke through chattering teeth: “Who... who...”\nA face formed itself upon her awareness. It was a smiling face of such fatness that it could have been a baby’s except for the glittering eagerness of the eyes. She tried to pull back, but achieved only a longer view which included the body attached to that face. The body was grossly, immensely fat, clothed in a robe which revealed by subtle bulges beneath it that this fat had required the support of portable suspensors.\n“You see,” the basso voice rumbled, “it is only your maternal grandfather. You know me. | was the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.”\n“You're... you’re dead!” she gasped.\n“But, of course, my dear! Most of us within you are dead. But none of the others are really willing to help you. They don’t understand you.”\n“Go away,” she pleaded. “Oh, please go away.”\n“But you need help, granddaughter,” the Baron’s voice argued.\nHow remarkable he looks, she thought, watching the projection of the Baron against her closed eyelids.\n“I’m willing to help you,” the Baron wheedled. “The others in here would only fight to take over your entire\nconsciousness. Any one of them would try to drive you out. But me...I! want only a little corner of my own.”\nAgain the other lives within her lifted their clamor. The tide once more threatened to engulf her and she heard her mother’s voice screeching. And Alia thought: She’s not dead.\n“Shut up!” the Baron commanded.\nAlia felt her own desires reinforcing that command, making it felt throughout her awareness.\nInner silence washed through her like a cool bath and she felt her hammering heart begin slowing to its normal pace. Soothingly the Baron’s voice intruded: “You see? Together, we’re invincible. You help me and | help you.”\n“What... what do you want?” she whispered.\nA pensive look came over the fat face against her closed eyelids. “Ahhh, my darling granddaughter,” he said, “I wish only a few simple pleasures. Give me but an occasional moment of contact with your senses. No one else need ever know. Let me feel but a small corner of your life when, for example, you are enfolded in the arms of your lover. Is that not a small price to ask?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Good, good,” the Baron chortled. “In return, my darling granddaughter, | can serve you in many ways. | can advise you, help you with my counsel. You will be invincible within and without. You will sweep away all opposition. History will forget your brother and cherish you. The future will be yours.”\n“You... won't let... the.. .the others take over?”\n“They cannot stand against us! Singly we can be overcome, but together we command. I will demonstrate. Listen.”\nAnd the Baron fell silent, withdrawing his image, his inner presence. Not one memory, face, or voice of the other lives intruded.\nAlia allowed herself a trembling sigh.\nAccompanying that sigh came a thought. It forced itself into her awareness as though it were her own, but she sensed silent voices behind it.\nThe old Baron was evil. He murdered your father. He would’ve killed you and Paul. He tried to and failed.\nThe Baron’s voice came to her without a face: “Of course | would’ve killed you. Didn’t you stand in my way? But that argument is ended. You’ve won it, child! You’re the new truth.”\nShe felt herself nodding and her cheek moved scratchingly against the harsh surface of the bench.\nHis words were reasonable, she thought. A Bene Gesserit precept reinforced the reasonable character of his words: “The purpose of argument is to change the nature of truth.\nYes... that was the way the Bene Gesserit would have it.\n“Precisely!” the Baron said. “And | am dead while you are alive. | have only a fragile existence. I’m a mere memory- self within you. | am yours to command. And how little | ask in return for the profound advice which is mine to deliver.”\n“What do you advise me to do now?” she asked, testing.\n“You're worried about the judgment you gave last night,” he said. “You wonder if Paymon’s words were reported truthfully. Perhaps Javid saw in this Paymon a threat to his position of trust. Is this not the doubt which assails you?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“And your doubt is based on acute observation, is it not? Javid behaves with increasing intimacy toward your person. Even Duncan has noted it, hasn’t he?”\n“You know he has.”\n“Very well, then. Take Javid for your lover and—”\n“No!”\n“You worry about Duncan? But your husband is a mentat mystic. He cannot be touched or harmed by activities of the flesh. Have you not felt sometimes how distant he is from you?”\n“B-but he...”\n”\n“Duncan’s mentat part would understand should he ever have need to know the device you employed in destroying Javid.”\n“Destroy...”\n“Certainly! Dangerous tools may be used, but they should be cast aside when they grow too dangerous.”\n“Then...why should...I|mean...”\n“Ahhh, you precious dunce! Because of the value contained in the lesson.”\n“| don’t understand.”\n“Values, my dear grandchild, depend for their acceptance upon their success. Javid’s obedience must be unconditional, his acceptance of your authority absolute, and his—”\n“The morality of this /esson escapes—”\n“Don’t be dense, grandchild! Morality must always be based on practicality. Render unto Caesar and all that nonsense. A victory is useless unless it reflects your deepest wishes. Is it not true that you have admired Javid’s manliness?”\nAlia swallowed, hating the admission, but forced to it by her complete nakedness before the inner-watcher. “Ye-es.” “Good!” How jovial the word sounded within her head.\n“Now we begin to understand each other. When you have him helpless, then, in your bed, convinced that you are his thrall, you will ask him about Paymon. Do it jokingly: a rich laugh between you. And when he admits the deception, you will slip a crysknife between his ribs. Ahhh, the flow of blood can add so much to your satis—”\n“No,” she whispered, her mouth dry with horror. “No... NO... NO...”\n“Then I will do it for you,” the Baron argued. “It must be done; you admit that. If you but set up the conditions, I will assume temporary sway over...”\n“No!”\n“Your fear is so transparent, granddaughter. My sway of your senses cannot be else but temporary. There are others, now, who could mimic you to a perfection that... But you know this. With me, ahhh, people would spy out my presence immediately. You know the Fremen Law for those possessed. You’d be slain out of hand. Yes—even you. And you know | do not want that to happen. l'Il take care of Javid for you and, once it’s done, l'Il step aside. You need only...”\n“How is this good advice?”\n“It rids you of a dangerous tool. And, child, it sets up the working relationship between us, a relationship which can only teach you well about future judgments which—”\n“Teach me?”\n“Naturally!”\nAlia put her hands over her eyes, trying to think, Knowing that any thought might be known to this presence within her, that a thought might originate with that presence and be taken as her own.\n“You worry yourself needlessly,” the Baron wheedled. “This Paymon fellow, now, was—”\n“What | did was wrong! | was tired and acted hastily. | should’ve sought confirmation of—”\n“You did right! Your judgments cannot be based on any such foolish abstract as that Atreides notion of equality. That’s what kept you sleepless, not Paymon’s death. You made a good decision! He was another dangerous tool. You acted to maintain order in your society. Now there’s a good reason for judgments, not this justice nonsense! There’s no such thing as equal justice anywhere. It’s unsettling to a society when you try to achieve such a false balance.”\nAlia felt pleasure at this defense of her judgment against Paymon, but shocked at the amoral concept behind the argument. “Equal justice was an Atreides . .. was...” She took her hands from her eyes, but kept her eyes closed.\n“All of your priestly judges should be admonished about this error,” the Baron argued. “Decisions must be weighed only as to their merit in maintaining an orderly society. Past civilizations without number have foundered on the rocks of equal justice. Such foolishness destroys the natural hierarchies which are far more important. Any individual takes on significance only in his relationship to your total society. Unless that society be ordered in logical steps, no one can find a place in it—not the lowliest or the highest. Come, come, grandchild! You must be the stern mother of your people. It’s your duty to maintain order.”\n“Everything Paul did wasto...”\n“Your brother’s dead, a failure!”\n“So are you!”\n“True... but with me it was an accident beyond my designing. Come now, let us take care of this Javid as | have outlined for you.”\nShe felt her body grow warm at the thought, spoke quickly: “I must think about it.” And she thought: /f it’s done, it'll be only to put Javid in his place. No need to kill him for that. And the fool might just give himself away... in my bed.\n“To whom do you talk, My Lady?” a voice asked.\nFor a confused moment, Alia thought this another intrusion by those clamorous multitudes within, but recognition of the voice opened her eyes. Ziarenka Valefor, chief of Alia’s guardian amazons, stood beside the bench, a worried frown on her weathered Fremen features.\n“I speak to my inner voices,” Alia said, sitting up on the bench. She felt refreshed, buoyed up by the silencing of that distracting inner clamor.\n“Your inner voices, My Lady. Yes.” Ziarenka’s eyes glistened at this information. Everyone knew the Holy Alia drew upon inner resources available to no other person.\n“Bring Javid to my quarters,” Alia said. “There’s a serious matter | must discuss with him.”\n“To your quarters, My Lady?”\n“Yes! To my private chamber.”\n“As My Lady commands.” The guard turned to obey.\n“One moment,” Alia said. “Has Master Idaho already gone to Sietch Tabr?”\n“Yes, My Lady. He left before dawn as you instructed. Do you wish me to send for...”\n“No. | will manage this myself.
