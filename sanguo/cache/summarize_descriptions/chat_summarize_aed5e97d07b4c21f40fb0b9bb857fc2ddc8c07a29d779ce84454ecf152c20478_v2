He is primarily recognized for conspiring with Yang Huai to assassinate the prominent warlord Liu Bei, a key figure in the establishment of the Shu Han state. This conspiracy highlights 高沛's role in the political intrigues and power struggles of the time, showcasing his willingness to engage in treachery for personal or strategic gain.\n\nIn addition to his conspiratorial activities, 高沛 also served as a general tasked with guarding the涪水关 (Fushuiguan), a strategic pass that was crucial for military movements and defense. His assignment alongside 杨怀 (Yang Huai) indicates that he held a position of responsibility and authority within the military hierarchy. This dual role as both a conspirator and a guardian of a vital location illustrates the complexity of 高沛's character and his involvement in the tumultuous events of the era.\n\nOverall, 高沛's actions reflect the turbulent nature of the Three Kingdoms period, where alliances were often fragile, and betrayal was a common occurrence among those vying for power.
