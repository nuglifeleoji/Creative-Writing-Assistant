You mustn’t refuse. Because, in return for this small service, I’m doing a thing for you. | will Save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.”\n“How...Ssave...them?” Leto whispered.\n“By making it appear they’re dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.” He touched Leto’s jaw. “Can you feel anything in your jaw?”\nThe Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh’s hand come up with the ducal signet ring.\n“For Paul,” Yueh said. “You'll be unconscious presently. Goodbye, my poor Duke. When next we meet we'll have no time for conversation.”\nCool remoteness spread upward from Leto’s jaw, across his cheeks. The shadowy hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh’s purple lips centered in it.\n“Remember the tooth!” Yueh hissed. “The tooth!”\nThere should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the\nstillness around her. She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish. Skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt...strange.\nLump-lump-lump-lump!\nIt was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere.\nThe waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needlestick movements.\nShe began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a gag in her mouth. She was on her side, hands tied behind her. She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled.\nAnd now, she remembered.\nThere had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her. She had gasped—one indrawn breath—sensing the narcotic in the wetness. Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.\nIt has come, she thought. How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All it took was treachery. Hawat was right.\nShe forced herself not to pull on her bindings.\nThis is not my bedroom, she thought. They’ve taken me someplace else.\nSlowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.\nShe grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear.\nWhere is Paul? she asked herself. My son—what have they done to him?\nCalmness.\nShe forced herself to it, using the ancient routines.\nBut terror remained so near.\nLeto? Where are you, Leto?\nShe sensed a diminishing in the dark. It began with shadows. Dimensions separated, became new thorns of awareness. White. A line under a door.\nl'm on the floor.\nPeople walking. She sensed it through the floor.\nJessica squeezed back the memory of terror. / must remain calm, alert, and prepared. | may get only one chance. Again, she forced the inner calmness.\nThe ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, Shaping out time. She counted back. / was unconscious about an hour. She closed her eyes, focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps.\nFour people.\nShe counted the differences in their steps.\nI must pretend I’m still unconscious. She relaxed against the cold floor, testing her body’s readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through her eyelids.\nFeet approached: someone standing over her.\n“You are awake,” rumbled a basso voice. “Do not pretend.”\nShe opened her eyes.\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side—empty. Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.\nShe looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spider- black eyes.\n“The drug was timed,” he rumbled. “We knew to the minute when you’d be coming out of it.”\nHow could that be? she wondered. They’d have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my.... Yueh!\n“Such a pity you must remain gagged,” the Baron said. “We could have such an interesting conversation.”\nYueh’s the only one it could be, she thought. How?\nThe Baron glanced behind him at the door. “Come in, Piter.”\nShe had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but the face was known— and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She studied him—hawk features, blue-ink eyes that\nsuggested he was a native of Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his flesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy.\n“Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica,” the Baron said. “However, I’m aware of your abilities.” He glanced at the Mentat. “Isn’t that true, Piter?”\n“AS you say, Baron,” the man said.\nThe voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the voice screamed: Killer!\n“I have a surprise for Piter,” the Baron said. “He thinks he has come here to collect his reward—you, Lady Jessica. But | wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.”\n“You play with me, Baron?” Piter asked, and he smiled.\nSeeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend himself from this Piter. Then She corrected herself. The Baron could not read that smile. He did not have the Training.\n“In many ways, Piter is quite naive,” the Baron said. “He doesn’t admit to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I’d show him, but it'd be a foolish risk.” The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting mask. “I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power.”\n“You promised | could have her,” Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve.\nJessica heard the clue-tones in the man’s voice, allowed herself an inward shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?\n“I give you a choice, Piter,” the Baron said.\n“What choice?”\nThe Baron snapped fat fingers. “This woman and exile from the Imperium, or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.”\nJessica watched the Baron’s spider eyes study Piter.\n“You could be Duke here in all but name,” the Baron said.\nIs my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.\nThe Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. “Understand yourself, Piter. You want her because She was a Duke’s woman, a symbol of his power— beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That’s more than a symbol; that’s the reality. With it you could have many women...and more.”\n“You do not joke with Piter?”\nThe Baron turned with that dancing lightness the Suspensors gave him. “Joke? I? Remember—/ am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the lad’s training. They are alike, this mother and son—deadly.” The Baron smiled. “I must go now. | will send in the guard I’ve reserved for this moment. He’s stone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He'll not permit you to untie her gag until you're off\nArrakis. If you choose not to leave...he has other orders.”\n“You don’t have to leave,” Piter said. “I’ve chosen.”\n“Ah, hah!” the Baron chortled. “Such quick decision can mean only one thing.”\n“I will take the duchy,” Piter said.\nAnd Jessica thought: Doesn’t Piter know the Baron’s lying to him? But—how could he know? He’s a twisted Mentat.\nThe Baron glanced down at Jessica. “Is it not wonderful that | know Piter so well? | wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter’s choice. Hah! Well, | leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady Jessica? | had no rancor toward you. It’s a necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And l’ve not actually ordered you destroyed. When it’s asked of me what happened to you, I can Shrug it off in all truth.”\n“You leave it to me then?” Piter asked.\n“The guard | send you will take your orders,” the Baron said. “Whatever's done | leave to you.” He Stared at Piter. “Yes. There will be no blood on my hands here. It’s your decision. Yes. | know nothing of it. You will wait until I’ve gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well...ah, yes. Yes. Good.”\nHe fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah- h-h-h, my poor Leto.\nWith one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She followed him with her eyes, thinking: /t’s as the Reverend Mother warned—too potent an adversary.\nTwo Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.\nThe deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron Knows I could use the Voice on any other man.\nScarface looked at Piter. “We’ve the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?”\nPiter spoke to Jessica. “I’d thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but | begin to see that would not have worked. | let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: “Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found.”\n“You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?” Scarface asked.\nHe reads lips, Jessica thought.\n“I follow my Baron’s example,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor said.”\nJessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.\nPiter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f9f31de47369f03a4601e235a47b6e7cb1860798dfc7f8ae4829e086172451dd_v2"}
