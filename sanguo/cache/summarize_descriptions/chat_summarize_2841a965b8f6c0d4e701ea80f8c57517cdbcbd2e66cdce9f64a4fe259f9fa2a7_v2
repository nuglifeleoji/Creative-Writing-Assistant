His strategic operations were significantly centered in Luoyang, the capital city, which served as a pivotal location for his military endeavors. \n\nIn his efforts to consolidate power and counter the threat posed by the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao organized significant military gatherings in Luoyang. These gatherings were essential for strategizing and coordinating military actions against Dong Zhuo's forces.
