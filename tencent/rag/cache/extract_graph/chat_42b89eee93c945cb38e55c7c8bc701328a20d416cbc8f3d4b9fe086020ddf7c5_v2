She saw furnishings with permaflox fabrics. And behind the fabrics She felt plastic resilience. Everything done in the other colors of the rooms.\nThe bed was a small shock. Someone had taken the request for a hard mat too literally. Flat surface of black plaz without cushion. No bedding.\nSuipol, seeing this, started to object but Odrade silenced her. Despite Bene Gesserit resources, comfort sometimes fell by the wayside. Get the job done! That was their first order. If Mother Superior had to sleep occasionally on a hard surface without covers, this could be passed off in the name of duty. Besides, the Bene Gesserit had ways of adjusting to such inconsequentials. Odrade steeled herself to discomfort, aware that if she objected she might find another deliberate insult.\nLet them add this to all of that unconscious content and worry about it.\nHer summons came while she was inspecting the rest of their quarters, displaying minimal concern and open amusement. A voice piped through ceiling vents intruded as Odrade and her companions emerged into the common sitting room: “Return to the lobby where you will meet your escort to Great Honored Matre.”\n“I will go alone,” Odrade said, silencing objections.\nA green-robed Honored Matre waited on a fragile chair where the corridor entered the lobby. She had a face built up like a castle wall—stone laid on stone. Mouth a watergate through which she inhaled some liquid via a transparent straw. Flow of purple up the straw. Sugar odor in the liquid. The eyes were weapons peeking over ramparts. Nose: a Slope down which eyes dispatched their hatred. Chin: weak. Not necessary, that chin. An afterthought. Something left over from earlier construction. You could see the infant in it. And hair: artificially darkened to muddy brown. Unimportant. Eyes, nose, and mouth, those were important.\nThe woman stood slowly, insolently, emphasizing what a favor she did merely by noticing Odrade.\n“Great Honored Matre agrees to see you.”\nHeavy, almost masculine voice. Pride walled up so high she exposed it whatever she did. Packed solid with immovable prejudice. She knew so many things she was a walking display of ignorance and fears. Odrade saw her as a perfect demonstration of Honored Matre vulnerability.\nAt the end of many turnings and corridors, all of them bright and clean, they came to a long room—sun pouring in a line of windows, sophisticated military console at one end; space maps and terrain maps projected there. Center of Spider Queen’s web? Odrade entertained doubts. Console too obvious. Something of different design from the Scattering but no mistaking its purpose. Fields that humans could manipulate had physical limits, and a hood for mental interface could be nothing else even though it was a towering oval shape and a peculiar dirty yellow.\nShe swept her gaze over the room. Sparsely furnished. A few slingchairs and small tables, a large open area where (presumably) people could await orders. No clutter. This was Supposed to be an action center.\nImpress that upon the witch!\nWindows on one long wall revealed flagstones and gardens beyond. This whole thing was a set piece!\nWhere is Spider Queen? Where does she sleep? What is the appearance of her lair?\nTwo women came in through an arched doorway from the flagstones. Both wore red robes with glittering arabesques and dragon shapes on them. Soostones shattered for decorations.\nOdrade held her silence, exercising caution until after introductions by the escort, who uttered as few words as possible and left hurriedly.\nWithout Murbella’s hints, the tall one standing beside Spider Queen was the one Odrade would have taken for commander. But it was the smaller one. Fascinating.\nThis one did not just climb to power. She sneaked between the cracks. One day, her Sisters awoke to\naccomplished fact. There she was, firmly seated at the center. And who could object? Ten minutes after leaving her you would have difficulty remembering the target of your objections.\nThe two women examined Odrade with equal intensity.\nWell and good. That is needed at this moment.\nSpider Queen’s appearance was more than a Surprise. Until this moment, no physical description of her had been achieved by the Bene Gesserit. Only temporary projections, imaginative constructs based on scattered bits of evidence. Here she was, finally. A small woman. Expected stringy muscles visible under red leotards beneath her robe. Face a forgettable oval with bland brown eyes, orange flecks dancing in them.\nFearful and angered by it but cannot place the precise reasons for her fear. All she has Is a target—me. What does she think to gain from me?\nThe aide was something else: in appearance, far more dangerous. Golden hair so carefully coiffed, slight hook to the nose, thin lips, skin stretched tightly over high cheekbones. And that venemous glare.\nOdrade passed her gaze once more over Spider Queen’s features: a nose that some would have trouble describing a minute after leaving her.\nStraight? Well, somewhat.\nEyebrows a match to straw-colored hair. The mouth opened to become pinkly visible and almost vanished when closed. It was a face in which you had difficulty finding a central focus and thus the entire thing became blurred.\n“So you lead the Bene Gesserit.”\nVoice equally low-key. Oddly inflected Galach and no jargon, yet you sensed it just behind her tongue. Linguistic tricks were there. Murbella’s knowledge emphasized that.\n“They have something close to Voice. Not the equal of what you gave me but there are other things they do, word tricks of a sort.”\nWord tricks.\n“How should | address you?” Odrade asked.\n“| hear you call me the Spider Queen.” Orange flecks dancing viciously in her eyes.\n“Here at the center of your web and considering your vast powers, |’m afraid | must confess to it.”\n“So that is what you notice—my powers.” Vain!\nThe first thing Odrade actually had marked was the woman’s smell. She was bathed in some outrageous perfume.\nCovering up pheromones?\nWarned about Bene Gesserit ability to judge on the basis of minuscule sense data? Perhaps. Just as probably she preferred this perfume. The odious concoction had about it an underlying hint of exotic flowers. Something from her homeland?\nThe Spider Queen put a hand to her forgettable chin. “You may call me Dama.”\nThe companion objected. “This is the last enemy in the Million Planets!”\nSo that’s how they think of the Old Empire.\nDama held up a hand for silence. How casual and how revealing. Odrade saw a luster reminiscent of Bellonda in the aide’s eyes. Viciousness watchful in there and looking for places to attack.\n“Most are required to address me as Great Honored Matre,” Dama said. “I have conferred an honor upon you.” She gestured toward the arched doorway behind her. “We will walk outside, just the two of us, while we talk.”\nNo invitation; it was a command.\nOdrade paused beside the door to look at a map displayed there. Black on white, little lines of paths and irregular outlines with labels in Galach. It was the gardens beyond the flagstones, identification of plantings. Odrade bent close to study it while Dama waited with amused tolerance. Yes, esoteric trees and bushes, very few bearing\nedible fruits. Pride of possession and this map was here to emphasize it.\nOn the patio, Odrade said: “I noticed your perfume.”\nDama was thrown back into memories and her voice carried subtle undertones when she responded.\nFloral identity marker for her own flamebush. Imagine that! But she is both sad and angry when she thinks of this. And she wonders why I bring it to attention.\n“Otherwise, the bush would not have accepted me,” Dama said.\nInteresting choice of verb tense.\nThe accented Galach was not hard to understand. She obviously adjusted unconsciously for the listener.\nGood ear. Spends a few seconds, watching, listening and adjusts to make herself understood. Very old art form that most humans adopt quickly.\nOdrade saw the origins as protective coloration.\nDon’t want to be taken for an alien.\nAn adjustable characteristic built into the genes. Honored Matres had not lost it but this was a vulnerability. Unconscious tonalities were not completely covered and they revealed much.\nDespite her blatant vanity, Dama was intelligent and self- disciplined. It was a pleasure to come to that opinion. Certain circumlocutions were not necessary.\nOdrade stopped where Dama stopped at the edge of the patio. They stood almost shoulder to shoulder and Odrade, gazing outward at the garden, was struck by the almost Bene Gesserit appearance.\n“Speak your piece,” Dama said.\n“What value do | have as a hostage?” Odrade asked.\nOrange glare!\n“You've obviously asked the question,” Odrade said.\n“Do continue.” Orange subsiding.\n“The Sisterhood has three replacements for me.” Odrade produced her most penetrating stare. “It is possible for us to\nweaken each other in ways that would destroy us both.”\n“We could crush you as we would swat an insect!”\nBeware the orange!\nOdrade was not deflected by warnings from within. “But the hand that swatted us would fester, and eventually, sickness would consume you.”\nIt could not be stated plainer without specific details.\n“Impossible!” An orange glare.\n“Do you think us unaware of how you were driven back here by your enemies?”\nMy most dangerous gambit.\nOdrade watched it take effect. A dark scowl was not Dama’s only visible response. Orange vanished, leaving her eyes an oddly bland discrepancy on the glowering face.\nOdrade nodded as though Dama had answered. “We could leave you vulnerable to those who assail you, those who drove you into this cul de sac.”\n“You think we...”\n“We know.”\nAt least, now | know.\nThe knowledge produced both elation and fear.\nWhat is out there to subdue these women?\n“We merely gather our forces before—”\n“Before returning to an arena where you are sure to be crushed ... where you cannot count on overwhelming numbers.”\nDama’s voice relapsed into soft Galach that Odrade had difficulty understanding. “So they have been to you... and made their offer. What fools you are to trust the...”\n“I have not said we trust.”\n“If Logno back there .. .” Nod of head indicating the aide in the room “...heard you talking to me this way you would be dead in less time than I take to warn you of it.”\n“I am fortunate there are only the two of us.”\n“Don’t count on that to carry you much farther.”\nOdrade glanced over her shoulder at the building. Alterations in Guild design were visible: a long façade of windows, much exotic wood and jeweled stones.\nWealth.\nShe was dealing with wealth in an extreme it would be hard for some to imagine. Nothing Dama wanted, nothing that could be provided by the society subservient to her, would be denied. Nothing except freedom to go back into the Scattering.\nHow firmly did Dama cling to the fantasy that her exile might end? And what was the force that had driven such power back to the Old Empire? Why here? Odrade dared not ask.\n“We will continue this in my quarters,” Dama said.\nInto the Spider Queen’s lair at last!\nDama’s quarters were a bit of a puzzle. Richly carpeted floors. She kicked off sandals and went barefoot on entering. Odrade followed this lead.\nLook at the callused flesh along the outsides of her feet!
