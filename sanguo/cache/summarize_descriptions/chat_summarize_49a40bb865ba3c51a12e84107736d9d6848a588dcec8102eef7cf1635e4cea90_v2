This multifaceted partnership is further exemplified when 孔明 sends 费祎 to deliver critical messages to Sun Quan, a key ally, regarding military strategies, showcasing 费祎's importance in diplomatic communications as well.\n\nTogether, 孔明 and 费祎 work diligently to advise 后主 and oversee the affairs of the Shu Han state, ensuring that the kingdom remains stable and strategically sound during a tumultuous period in Chinese history.
