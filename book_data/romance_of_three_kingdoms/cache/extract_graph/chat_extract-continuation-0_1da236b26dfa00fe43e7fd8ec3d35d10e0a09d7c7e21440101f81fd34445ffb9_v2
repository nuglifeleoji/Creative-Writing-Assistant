�玄闻之大惊，便教黄忠出马。玄自来城上观看。忠提刀纵马，引五百骑兵飞过吊桥。云长见一老将出马，知是黄忠，把五百校刀手一字摆开，横刀立马而问曰：“来将莫非黄忠否？”忠曰：“既知我名，焉敢犯我境！”云长曰：“特来取汝首级！”言罢，两马交锋。斗一百余合，不分胜负。韩玄恐黄忠有失，鸣金收军。黄忠收军入城。云长也退军，离城十里下寨，心中暗忖：“老将黄忠，名不虚传：斗一百合，全无破绽。来日必用拖刀计，背砍赢之。”\n\n    次日早饭毕，又来城下搦战。韩玄坐在城上，教黄忠出马。忠引数百骑杀过吊桥，再与云长交马。又斗五六十合，胜负不分，两军齐声喝采。鼓声正急时，云长拨马便走。黄忠赶来。云长方欲用刀砍去，忽听得脑后一声响；急回头看时，见黄忠被战马前失，掀在地下。云长急回马，双手举刀猛喝曰：“我且饶你性命！快换马来厮杀！”黄忠急提起马蹄，飞身上马，弃入城中。玄惊问之。忠曰：“此马久不上阵，故有此失。”玄曰：“汝箭百发百中，何不射之？”忠曰：“来日再战，必然诈败，诱到吊桥边射之。”玄以自己所乘一匹青马与黄忠。忠拜谢而退，寻思：“难得云长如此义气！他不忍杀害我，我又安忍射他？若不射，又恐违了将令。”是夜踌躇未定。\n\n    次日天晓，人报云长搦战。忠领兵出城。云长两日战黄忠不下，十分焦躁，抖擞威风，与忠交马。战不到三十余合，忠诈败，云长赶来。忠想昨日不杀之恩，不忍便射，带住刀，把弓虚拽弦响，云长急闪，却不见箭；云长又赶，忠又虚拽，云长急闪，又无箭；只道黄忠不会射，放心赶来。将近吊桥，黄忠在桥上搭箭开弓，弦响箭到，正射在云长盔缨根上。前面军齐声喊起。云长吃了一惊，带箭回寨，方知黄忠有百步穿杨之能，今日只射盔缨，正是报昨日不杀之恩也。云长领兵而退。黄忠回到城上来见韩玄，玄便喝左右捉下黄忠。忠叫曰：“无罪！”玄大怒曰：“我看了三日，汝敢欺我！汝前日不力战，必有私心；昨日马失，他不杀汝，必有关通；今日两番虚拽弓弦，第三箭却止射他盔缨，如何不是外通内连？若不斩汝，必为后患！”喝令刀斧手推下城门\n######################\nOutput:",
