邳，杨奉一军取浚山：七路军马，日行五十里，于路劫掠将来。乃急召众谋士商议，陈宫与陈珪父子俱至。陈宫曰：“徐州之祸，乃陈珪父子所招，媚朝廷以求爵禄，今日移祸于将军。可斩二人之头献袁术，其军自退。”布听其言，即命擒下陈珪、陈登。陈登大笑曰：“何如是之懦也？吾观七路之兵，如七堆腐草，何足介意！”布曰：“汝若有计破敌、免汝死罪。”陈登曰：“将军若用老夫之言，徐州可保无虞。”布曰：“试言之。”登曰：“术兵虽众，皆乌合之师，素不亲信；我以正兵守之，出奇兵胜之，无不成功。更有一计，不止保安徐州，并可生擒袁术。”布曰：“计将安出？”登曰：“韩暹、杨奉乃汉旧臣，因惧曹操而走，无家可依，暂归袁术；术必轻之，彼亦不乐为术用。若凭尺书结为内应，更连刘备为外合，必擒袁术矣。”布曰：“汝须亲到韩暹、杨奉处下书。”陈登允诺。布乃发表上许都，并致书与豫州，然后令陈登引数骑，先于下邳道上候韩暹。退引兵至，下寨毕，登入见。暹问曰：“汝乃吕布之人，来此何干？”登笑曰：“某为大汉公卿，何谓吕布之人？若将军者，向为汉臣，今乃为叛贼之臣，使昔日关中保驾之功，化为乌有，窃为将军不取也。且袁术性最多疑，将军后必为其所害。今不早图，悔之无及！”暹叹曰：“吾欲归汉，恨无门耳。”登乃出布书。暹览书毕曰：“吾已知之。公先回。吾与杨将军反戈击之。但看火起为号，温侯以兵相应可也。”登辞暹，急回报吕布。\n\n
