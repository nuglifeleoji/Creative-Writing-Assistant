，“其实，不要把海军与太空的距离想得那么远。为什么是宇宙飞船而不是宇宙飞机呢？为什么是太空舰队而不是太空机群呢，在人们的思想中，太空和海洋早就有联系了。”\n　　会场的气氛放松了一些，常伟思接着说：“同志们，到目前为止这个新军种还只有我们三十一名成员。关于未来的太空舰队，目前所进行的是基础研究工作，各学科的研究已经全面展开。主要力量集中在太空电梯和大型飞船的核聚变发动机上……但这些都不是太空军的工作，我们的任务，是要创立一个太空战争的理论体系。对于这种战争，我们所知为零，所以这是一个艰巨的任务，也是最基础的工作，因为未来太空舰队的建设，是要以这个理论体系为基础的。所以，初级阶段的太空军更像一个军事科学院，我们在座同志的首要工作就是组建这个科学院，下一步，大批的学者和研究人员将进入太空军。”\n　　常伟思站起来，走到军徽前转身面对太空军的全体指战员，说出了他们终生难忘的一段话：“同志们，太空军的历程是十分漫长的，按初步预计，各学科的基础研究至少需要五十年，而大规模太空航行的各项关键技术，还需要一个世纪才能成熟到实用阶段；太空舰队从初建到达到预想规模，乐观的估计也需要一个半世纪。也就是说，太空军从组建到形成完整战斗力，需要三个世纪的时间。同志们，我想你们已经知道这意味着什么。我们在场的所有人都没有机会进入太空，更不可能在有生之年见到我们的太空舰队，甚至连一个可信的太空战舰模型都见不到。太空舰队的第一代指战员将在两个世纪后产生，而从这时再过两个半世纪，地球舰队将面对外星侵略者，那时在战舰上的，是我们的第十几代子孙。”\n　　军人们陷入了长久的沉默，铅色的时光之路在他们面前徐徐展开，在漫长的延伸中隐人未来的茫茫迷雾中。他们看不清这长路的尽头，但能看到火焰和血光在那里闪耀。人生苦短这一现实从来没有像现在这样折磨他们，他们的心已飞越时间之穹，与他们的十几代子孙一起投入到冷酷太空中的血与火里，那是所有军人的灵魂相聚的地方。\n　　苗福全一回来，照例请张援朝和杨晋文去他家里喝酒聊天，那个川妹子做了一桌丰盛的菜。酒桌上，张援朝说起了上午去建行取钱的事。\n　　“你没听说呀，好几家银行都踩死人了，那柜台前的人摞了三层！”苗福全说。\n　　“那你的钱呢，”张援朝问。\n　　“取出来一部分，剩下的就冻着呗，有啥法儿。”\n　　“你拔根毛儿都比我们多。”老张说。\n　　杨晋文说：“新闻里说了，以后社会的�\n######################\nOutput:",
