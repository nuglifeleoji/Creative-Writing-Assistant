This project aims to showcase what appears to be supernatural powers, with the intention of inciting a sense of reverence among humans towards the Trisolaran civilization. By doing so, the project seeks to undermine and ultimately collapse scientific reasoning and critical thinking among Earth's inhabitants.\n\nThe overarching goal of the Miracle Project is to manipulate human perception and belief systems, steering them away from rationality and towards a form of worship of the Trisolaran civilization. This manipulation is facilitated by the deployment of Sophons, which are capable of executing complex tasks and creating significant disruptions in scientific endeavors on Earth. The project reflects the Trisolaran strategy of using psychological and technological means to gain an upper hand in their interactions with humanity.\n\nIn summary, the \"\"神迹计划\"\" is a calculated effort by the Trisolaran civilization to influence Earth through the demonstration of seemingly miraculous capabilities, aiming to foster a dependency on and admiration for their advanced civilization while eroding the foundations of scientific thought among humans.\",5\r\n1034,智子一号,智子一号是一个人工智能体，经过复杂的工程和调试后首次试运行，具备空间维度控制功能,13\r\n1040,智子三号,智子三号是智子一号的后续版本，旨在进一步增强对宏观世界的感知能力。,2\r\n1041,智子四号,智子四号是智子一号的后续版本，旨在进一步增强对宏观世界的感知能力。,2\r\n1048,量子感应,量子感应是一种超距现象，使得智子能够实时传递信息。,2\r\n1035,控制中心,控制中心是智子一号的操作和监控地点，负责系统的自检和指令输入,1\r\n1036,系统自检程序,系统自检程序是智子一号启动时的初步检查过程，确保系统正常运行,1\r\n1037,空间维度控制功能,空间维度控制功能是智子一号的关键能力，允许其在不同维度之间进行操作,1\r\n1039,智子二号,智子二号是一个高能加速器，作为神迹计划的一部分，与智子一号共同运作。智子二号被视为智子一号的后续版本，其主要目标是进一步增强对宏观世界的感知能力。这一进步不仅体现了技术的演变，也标志着在科学研究和探索领域的持续努力。通过智子二号的应用，研究人员期望能够获得更深入的理解和更广泛的视角，从而推动相关领域的发展。,4\r\n1038,智子阵列,智子阵列是由多个智子构成的系统，能够感知宏观世界并接收电磁波。,4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1412,三体文明,神迹计划,三体文明通过神迹计划试图使地球人崇拜其文明,44\r\n1476,智子一号,科学执政官,\"The \"\"科学执政官\"\" (Scientific Governor) plays a pivotal role in the development and enhancement of \"\"智子一号\"\" (Zhizi No. 1), a sophisticated entity designed to embody advanced intelligence.
