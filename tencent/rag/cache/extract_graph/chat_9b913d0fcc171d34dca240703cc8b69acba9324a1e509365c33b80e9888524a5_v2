Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently. As it grew older, the characteristic up-side became an\nalmost constant thing. Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales could be told by size alone on a big worm.\nShifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead. The left-side steersman opened a ring segment there.\nIn a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment. Full around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: “Geyrat!”\nThe steersman released his hook. The maker lined out in a straight course.\nStilgar said, “Very good, Paul-Muad’Dib. With plenty of practice, you may yet become a sandrider.”\nPaul frowned, thinking: Was / not first up?\nFrom behind him there came sudden laughter. The troop began chanting, flinging his name against the Sky.\n“Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!”\nAnd far to the rear along the worm’s surface, Paul heard the beat of the goaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed. Their robes flapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage increased.\nPaul looked back through the troop, found Chani’s face among them. He looked at her as he spoke to Stilgar. “Then | am a sandrider, Stil?”\n“Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day.”\n“Then | may choose our destination?”\n“That’s the way of it.”\n“And | am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erg. | have had no life before this day. | was as a Child until this day.”\n“Not quite a child,” Stilgar said. He fastened a corner of his hood where the wind was whipping it.\n“But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been pulled.”\n“There is no cork.”\n“I would go south, Stilgar—twenty thumpers. | would see this land we make, this land that I’ve only seen through the eyes of others.”\nAnd I would see my son and my family, he thought. / need time now to consider the future that is a past within my mind. The turmoil comes and if l'm not where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.\nStilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze. Paul kept his attention on Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also the excitement his words had kindled in the troop.\n“The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks,” Stilgar said. “The sinks are only a thumper away.”\n“The Fedaykin have raided with me,” Paul said. “They'll raid with me again until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.”\nStilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing this moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the Tabr sietch and to leadership of the Council of Leaders now that Liet-Kynes was dead.\nHe has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen, Paul thought.\n“Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?” Stilgar asked.\nEyes blazed among the young men of the troop. They swayed as they rode, and they watched. And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chani’s glance, the way She looked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul- Muad’Dib, who was her mate.\n“You cannot guess what | want,” Paul said.\nAnd he thought: / cannot back down. | must hold control over these people.\n“You are mudir of the sandride this day,” Stilgar said. Cold formality rang in his voice: “How do you use this power?”\nWe need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thought.\n“We shall go south,” Paul said.\n“Even if | say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?”\n“We shall go south,” Paul repeated.\nA sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly around him. “There will be a Gathering,” he said. “I will send the messages.”\nHe thinks | will call him out, Paul thought. And he knows he cannot stand against me.\nPaul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of the necessities that went into his decisions.\nThey do not know how it is, he thought.\nBut he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him. He had to remain on the central line of\nthe time storm he could see in the future. There would come an instant when it could be unraveled, but only if he were where he could cut the central knot of it.\nI will not call him out if it can be helped, he thought. /f there’s another way to prevent the jihad.... “We'll camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath Habbanya Ridge,” Stilgar said.\nHe steadied himself with one hook against the swaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the desert.\nPaul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves. No green, no blossom softened that rigid horizon. Beyond it stretched the way to the southern desert—a course of at least ten days and nights, as fast as they could goad the makers.\nTwenty thumpers.\nThe way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols. He knew how it would be. The dreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there’d be a faint change of color on the far horizon—such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining it out of his hopes—and there would be the new sietch.\n“Does my decision suit Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked. Only the faintest touch of sarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every tone ina bird’s cry or a cielago’s piping message, heard the Sarcasm and watched Paul to see what he would do.\n“Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the Fedaykin,” Paul said. “My death commandos know | spoke with honor. Does Stilgar doubt it?”\nReal pain exposed itself in Paul’s voice. Stilgar heard it and lowered his gaze.\n“Usul, the companion of my sietch, him | would never doubt,” Stilgar said. “But you are Paul- Muad’Dib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. These men | don’t even know.”\nPaul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert. The maker beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry them almost twice the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He knew it. There was nothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of the desert. It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized.\nA hand gripped his shoulder.\nPaul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it—the dark eyes of Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.\n“The one who led Tabr sietch before me,” Stilgar said, “he was my friend. We shared dangers. He owed me his life many a time...and | owed him mine.”\n“lam your friend, Stilgar,” Paul said.\n“No man doubts it,” Stilgar said. He removed his hand, shrugged. “It’s the way.”\nPaul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the possibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of his predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in the desert. Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.\n“We should leave this maker in deep sand,” Paul Said.\n“Yes,” Stilgar agreed. “We could walk to the cave from here.”\n“We've ridden him far enough that he’ll bury himself and sulk for a day or so,” Paul said.\n“You're the mudir of the sandride,” Stilgar said. “Say when we...” He broke off, stared at the eastern Sky.\nPaul whirled. The spice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark, a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in Sharp contrast.\nOrnithopter!\n“One small ‘thopter,” Stilgar said.\n“Could be a scout,” Paul said. “Do you think they’ve seen us?”\n“At this distance we’re just a worm on the Surface,” Stilgar said. He motioned with his left hand. “Off. Scatter on the sand.”\nThe troop began working down the worm’s sides, dropping off, blending with the sand beneath their cloaks. Paul marked where Chani dropped. Presently, only he and Stilgar remained.\n“First up, last off,” Paul said.\nStilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand. Paul waited until the maker was Safely clear of the scatter area, then released his hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted.\nFreed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the sand. Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and leaped off. He landed running, lunged against the\nSlipface of a dune the way he had been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe.\nNow, the waiting....\nPaul turned, gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe. He imagined the others back along their path doing the same.\nHe heard the beat of the ’thopter’s wings before he saw it. There was a whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a broad arc toward the ridge.\nAn unmarked ‘thopter, Paul noted.\nIt flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge.\nA bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.\nPaul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top. Other figures stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge. He recognized Chani and Stilgar among them.\nStilgar signaled toward the ridge.\nThey gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a broken rhythm that would disturb no maker. Stilgar paced himself beside Paul along the windpacked crest of a dune.\n“It was a smuggler craft,” Stilgar said.\n“So it seemed,” Paul said. “But this is deep into the desert for smugglers.”\n“They've their difficulties with patrols, too,” Stilgar said.\n“If they come this deep, they may go deeper,” Paul said.\n“True.”\n“It wouldn’t be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured too deep into the south. Smugglers sell information, too.”\n“They were hunting spice, don’t you think?” Stilgar asked.\n“There will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one,” Paul said. “We’ve spice. Let’s bait a patch of sand and catch us some Smugglers. They should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new weapons.”\n“Now, Usul speaks,” Stilgar said. “Usul thinks Fremen.”\nBut Usul must give way to decisions that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9b913d0fcc171d34dca240703cc8b69acba9324a1e509365c33b80e9888524a5_v2"}
