Among his notable contributions is the proposal of the 连环计, a strategic maneuver designed to outsmart and defeat the forces of 曹操, a powerful warlord of the time. The 连环计, which translates to \"Chain Stratagem,\" is characterized by its intricate planning and execution, aimed at creating a series of interconnected tactics that can effectively disrupt and dismantle the enemy's operations.\n\nIn addition to its application against 曹操's land forces, 庞统's 连环计 is also recognized for its potential to enhance the effectiveness of naval forces. This dual application underscores the versatility of the strategy, allowing it to be adapted to various combat scenarios, whether on land or at sea. By leveraging the strengths of naval capabilities, 庞统 aimed to create a comprehensive approach that would maximize the impact of his forces against the formidable adversary.\n\nOverall, the 连环计 exemplifies 庞统's strategic ingenuity and his ability to devise complex plans that could turn the tide of battle in favor of his allies.
