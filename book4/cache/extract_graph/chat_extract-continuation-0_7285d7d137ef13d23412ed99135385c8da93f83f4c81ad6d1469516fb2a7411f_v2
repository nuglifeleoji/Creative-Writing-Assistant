，他的思维又从润叶转到了汽车上。润叶和汽车，几乎是他生活的全部内容。当他得不到润叶的时候，汽车就是他的爱人。现在，这个“爱人”也别了；他再也不能驾驶着心爱的汽车奔驰在四面八方。令人痛心的是，正是他所迷恋的这两个“爱人”最终结束了他的生活……约摸在午饭前后，向前感到两条断腿被截去的地方剧烈地疼痛起来。他咬着牙不让自己喊出声。说来也奇怪，失去了两条腿之后，他似乎在感情、思想和意志方面，猛然间变得丰富、深沉和强大起来。一夜之间，他好象成了另外一个李向前！ \n　　李向前啊，李向前！面对眼前的你，我们悲伤，但也感到欣慰。你的两条腿是失去了，但愿你能在精神上站起来！死是不可取的。死并不表明强大（当然，也未必就是软弱）。 \n　　正在向前伤痛难忍的时候，悲伤的父母亲一起走进病房来。他们趴在他床边，再一次泣不成声。向前看见，两个老人脸色灰暗，皱纹横七竖八布满额头，衰老得几乎都让他认不出来——他知道父母亲已经被折磨垮了。这时，他才真正感到了一种无法言语的痛苦。为了自己失去的双腿，为了年老的父母，他的心象尖刀在捅戳。死被暂时忘却了，活人的痛苦却又尖锐地主宰了他的意识。但他强忍着没有哭。他也无话可安慰老人。他紧闭着嘴巴，让苦涩的泪水流进咽喉里…… \n　　又过了一会，原西县运输公司的领导以及他父母亲的许多朋友熟人，先后都涌进了这个小小的病房。来看望他的人都带着礼物；各种吃的和喝的，罐头，桔子水，水果，饼干，蛋糕……堆满了床头柜，挤满了两个窗台。 \n　　向前真不愿意看见这么多人。他央求父母亲说：“你们都回去，这里有护士……你们不要着急，事情已经这样了……我想一个安静一点……” \n　　他闭住了自己的眼睛。 \n　　他听见护士也在婉言劝说父母亲和其他人离开病房。不一会，一切又重新安静了下来。向前仍然闭着眼睛，在疼痛中恍惚地回想刚才来了些谁？他在一片虚无中追寻的还是那个人啊！ \n　　是的，她没有来。 \n　　她不知道他已经成了这个样子？就是知道了她也不会来…… \n　　不知为什么，李向前突然渴望能最后再见润叶一面。他在内心重新审视了他最终的人生极地，结论仍然是去死。但他想在死之前，再见一次她。 \n　　为什么要见她？他是想对她说，他要和她办离婚手续。他不能让她成为“寡妇”。在他死之前，就应该让�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>李向前<|>PERSON<|>李向前 is a character who has lost
