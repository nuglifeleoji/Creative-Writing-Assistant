真正的“资产阶级法权”！他把别的农民打得死去活来，却让自己的农民父亲一分钱也不出，在公社的锅里挑肥拣瘦地大吃二喝！ \n　　那位穿黑棉袄的“太上皇”如入无人之境般挖了一大碗肉片子，又抓了三个白蒸馍，自大地连灶房里所有的人都不看一眼，就昂着头出去了。在周文龙的父亲看来，柳岔公社就是他儿子的天下，他要怎样就可以怎样！ \n　　田福军和张有智很不舒服地在公社灶上匆匆吃完了饭，然后就和刘志祥一起去了公社的大会战工地。 \n　　会战工地在离公社五华里路的一条河上。全公社集中起两千多民工，在河两面的山上把土挖下来，打一个大土坝，企图把这条十华里长的河流整个拦截在这里。 \n　　田福军一行人来到工地时，正是民工们休息的时候，河两面的山坡上和河道中间的坝基上，到处都坐着人。高音喇叭不休息，正在广播两报一刊元旦社论《世上无难事，只要肯登攀》。 \n　　只有一个地方的人还在继续干活——这正是那些被劳教的民工。他们除过两顿饭，一整天都不准休息。他们周围蹲着几个扛枪的民兵，谁稍微站一下，民兵小分队的人就大声呵斥一阵。田福军他们走到一个帆布搭起的工地指挥部前面，刘志祥就大声喊叫公社的另一个副主任和武装专干过这边来。 \n　　这两个干部先后跑过来了，一看是县上的两个领导，赶忙上来握手问候，并扭过头吼叫人把茶水端过来！ \n　　田福军和张有智没让他们拿水，问这两个人：现在工地上还有多少被劳教的人？ \n　　这两个人回答说，本来有五十六个人，但昨晚上偷跑了两个，现在还有五十四人。 \n　　田福军对他们说：“过去把那些人都放了！让他们各回各村的民工连去！” \n　　张有智立刻又补充说：“再不准搞这些名堂！农民有点错误，可以在政治夜校批判一下就行了！” \n　　这两个人显然急忙反应不过来。武装专干问：“是不是周主任决定的？” \n　　刘志祥瞪了专干一眼，说：“这是县上的领导决定的！” \n　　两个呆若木鸡的人这才明白过来：县上的领导比周主任的官大！ \n　　他们没敢再说二话，赶紧过去执行县领导的决定去了。这些被劳教的人员刚释放，整个工地一下子就沸腾了。人们立刻一传十，十传百，说县上来了两个主任，把“劳改队”解散了！ \n　　民工们马上从四面八方向这个帆布蓬前涌来。 \n　　老百姓七嘴八舌向这两个“青天”告状，说他们如何吃不饱饭；如何劳累——白天干一天，晚上还要夜战，睡觉时间只有四、五个钟头，还又�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIU
