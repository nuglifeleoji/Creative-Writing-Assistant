杀贼大胜而回；于城门外焚烧人头，以妇女财物分散众军。越骑校尉伍孚，字德瑜，见卓残暴，愤恨不平，尝于朝服内披小铠，藏短刀，欲伺便杀卓。一日，卓入朝，孚迎至阁下，拔刀直刺卓。卓气力大，两手抠住；吕布便入，揪倒伍孚。卓问曰：“谁教汝反？”孚瞪目大喝曰：“汝非吾君，吾非汝臣，何反之有？汝罪恶盈天，人人愿得而诛之！吾恨不车裂汝以谢天下！”卓大怒，命牵出剖剐之。孚至死骂不绝口。后人有诗赞之曰：“汉末忠臣说伍孚，冲天豪气世间无。朝堂杀贼名犹在，万古堪称大丈夫！”董卓自此出入常带甲士护卫。\n\n    时袁绍在渤海，闻知董卓弄权，乃差人赍密书来见王允。书略曰：“卓贼欺天废主，人不忍言；而公恣其跋扈，如不听闻，岂报国效忠之臣哉？绍今集兵练卒，欲扫清王室，未敢轻动。公若有心，当乘间图之。如有驱使，即当奉命。”王允得书，寻思无计。一日，于侍班阁子内见旧臣俱在，允曰：“今日老夫贱降，晚间敢屈众位到舍小酌。”众官皆曰：“必来祝寿。”当晚王允设宴后堂，公卿皆至。酒行数巡，王允忽然掩面大哭。众官惊问曰：“司徒贵诞，何故发悲？”允曰：“今日并非贱降，因欲与众位一叙，恐董卓见疑，故托言耳。董卓欺主弄权，社稷旦夕难保。想高皇诛秦灭楚，奄有天下；谁想传至今日，乃丧于董卓之手：此吾所以哭也。”于是众官皆哭。坐中一人抚掌大笑曰：“满朝公卿，夜哭到明，明哭到夜，还能哭死董卓否？”允视之，乃骁骑校尉曹操也。允怒曰：“汝祖宗亦食禄汉朝，今不思报国而反笑耶？”操曰：“吾非笑别事，笑众位无一计杀董卓耳。操虽不才，愿即断董卓头，悬之都门，以谢天下。”允避席问曰：“孟德有何高见？”操曰：“近日操屈身以事卓者，实欲乘间图之耳。今卓颇信操，操因得时近卓。闻司徒有七宝刀一口，愿借与操入相府刺杀之，虽死不恨！”允曰：“孟德果有是心，天下幸甚！”遂亲自酌酒奉操。操沥酒设誓，允随取宝刀与之。操藏刀，饮酒毕，即起身辞别众官而去。众官又坐了一回，亦俱散讫。\n\n
