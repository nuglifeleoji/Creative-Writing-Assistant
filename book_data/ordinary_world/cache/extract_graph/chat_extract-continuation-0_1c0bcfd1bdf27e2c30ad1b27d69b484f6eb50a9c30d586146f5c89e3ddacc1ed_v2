\n　　城市在睡梦中醒了，他进入了睡梦，睡梦中闪现的仍然是那张灿烂的笑脸……笑脸……倏忽间成为一面灿烂的镜面。镜面中映出了他的笑脸，映出了她的笑脸，两张笑脸紧贴在一起，亲吻…… \n　　他醒了。阳光从玻璃窗户射进来，映照着他腮边两串晶莹的泪珠。他重新把脸深深地埋进被子，无声地辍泣了许久。梦醒了，在他面前的仍然是残酷无情的事实。 \n　　中午十二点刚过，他就走出旅社，从东关大桥拐到小南河那里，开始向古塔山走去——走向那个神圣的地方。 \n　　对孙少平来说此行是在进行一次人生最为庄严的仪式。 \n　　他沿着弯曲的山路向上攀登。从山下到山上的这段路并不长。过去，他和晓霞常常用不了半个钟头，就立在古塔下面肩并肩眺望脚下的黄原城了。但现在这条路又是如此漫长，似乎那个目的地一直深埋在白云深处而不可企及。 \n　　实际中的距离当然没有改变。他很快就到了半山腰的一座亭子间。以前没有这亭子，是这两年才修起的吧？他慢慢发现，山的另外几处还有一些亭子。他这才想起山下立着“古塔山公园”的牌子。这里已经是公园了；而那时还是一片荒野，揽工汉夏天可以赤膊裸体睡在这山上——他就睡过好些夜晚。 \n　　他看了看手表，离一点四十五分还有一个小时；而他知道，再用不了二十分钟，就能走到那棵伤心树下。 \n　　他要按她说的，准时走到那地方。是的，准时。他于是在亭子间的一块圆石上坐下来。 \n　　黄原城一览无余。他的目光依次从东到西，又从北往南眺望着这座城市。这里那里，到处都有他留下的踪迹。 \n　　东关大桥头，仍然是人群最稠密的地方。他依稀辨认出了他当年曾驻足而立，等待包工头来买他力气的小土场，以及那个搁过破行李卷的砖墙。他的目光“走”到了北关。那不是阳沟吗？他的揽工生涯首先就是从那里开始的。他想起了曹书记一家人。他们的院落被山脉遮挡着，他看不见。但他们的面容依稀可见；想起当初他们对他的好心，至今还难以忘怀。 \n　　现在，他把忧伤的目光投向了麻雀山。那是他和她多次漫游过的地方。就是在那里，他心跳脸热，第一次产生了想拥抱她的强烈愿望。他想起了他们共同背诵那首吉尔吉斯人的古歌。他清楚地记得，那是一个黄昏，他仰面躺在一片枯草上，两只手垫在脑\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
