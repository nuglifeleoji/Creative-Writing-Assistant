眼中第一次流露出焦急之色。这孩子怎么承受得住啊！自己也太不小心了。这可麻烦大了。要是这孩子有个三长两短，怎么向人家父母交代？\n\n    蓝轩宇大脑一片空白之后就陷入了昏迷。\n\n    昏迷中，他似乎感觉到自己的身体里似乎有一个清脆的声音出现，就像是有一次他不小心摔碎了一个碗所发出的声音一样。清脆的破碎声。\n\n    然后他就做了一个梦。在那个梦里，有一金、一银两道光芒在相互的纠缠、碰撞。它们似乎谁都不认输，总想压制过对方。可是，却又谁都没能成功。\n\n    最终，一小团闪烁着九彩光晕的光团出现了。那光团分成很多个，一时之间蓝轩宇有些数不清楚。但这些光团却就是将那金色和银色的光芒分成很多份隔绝开来。\n\n    最后的时候，其中一个最小的彩色光团破碎了，悄无声息的融入到它所隔绝的那一小部分银色之中。然后那彩色又重新凝聚了一些，没有之前多了，但却似乎只是包覆着那片被释放出来的银色光芒相对的金色光芒，而那银色光芒却是悄然散开了。\n\n    其他的金色和银色光芒似乎变得有些平静，分开在两侧，似乎都在做着自己要做的事情。\n\n    当蓝轩宇迷迷糊糊的睁开眼睛的时候，看到的是一张张关切的面庞。\n\n    足足有五个人围在床边，正在看着他。\n\n    “醒了、醒了。他醒了。”有些兴奋的稚嫩女声响起，叶灵瞳蹦蹦跳跳的说道。\n\n    “轩宇，你怎么样？有没有什么不舒服？”带着哽咽的声音，南澄一下就扑到了儿子身边，握住他的小手。\n\n    蓝轩宇几乎是下意识的翻身坐起来，揉了揉眼睛，“妈妈，我这是怎么了？我怎么睡着了？”\n\n    站在床边的除了蓝潇、南澄之外，还有叶锋和叶灵瞳，除此之外，还有一名和叶灵瞳相貌很像的美妇。\n\n    “没事就好、没事就好。”南澄一把抱住蓝轩宇，泪水一下就流淌了下来。\n\n    站在床边的叶锋也是松了口气，看向蓝潇，道：“蓝兄，孩子醒过来了应该就能确定是确实没有事了。我们到外面说两句？”\n\n    “嗯。”蓝潇的脸色一直都有些不好。换了谁，儿子在家被弄昏迷了，情绪也好不了。\n\n    两个男人来到外面的阳台上，叶锋没有犹豫，立正，向蓝潇行了个军礼，“对不起，我为我的鲁莽向你们全家致歉。这件事我承担全部责任和后果。如果未来轩宇有什么不适，我全力以赴为他治疗。抱歉了。”\n\n    蓝潇\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
