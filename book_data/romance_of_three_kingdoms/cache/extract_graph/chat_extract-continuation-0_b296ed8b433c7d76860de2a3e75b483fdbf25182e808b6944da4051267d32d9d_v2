   楙至天水城下叫门，城上人认得是夏侯楙，慌忙开门迎接。马遵惊拜问之。楙细言姜维之事；又将百姓所言说了。遵叹曰：“不想姜维反投蜀矣！”梁绪曰：“彼意欲救都督，故以此言虚降。”楙曰：“今维已降，何为虚也？”正踌躇间，时已初更，蜀兵又来攻城。火光中见姜维在城下挺枪勒马，大叫曰：“请夏侯都督答话！”夏侯楙与马遵等皆到城上，见姜维耀武扬威大叫曰：“我为都督而降，都督何背前言？”楙曰：“汝受魏恩，何故降蜀？有何前言耶？”维应曰：“汝写书教我降蜀，何出此言？汝要脱身，却将我陷了？我今降蜀，加为上将，安有还魏之理？”言讫，驱兵打城，至晓方退。原来夜间妆姜维者，乃孔明之计，令部卒形貌相似者，假扮姜维攻城，因火光之中，不辨真伪。\n\n
