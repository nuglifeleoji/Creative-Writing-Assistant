�綝遣宗正孙楷、中书郎董朝，往虎林迎请琅琊王孙休为君。休字子烈，乃孙权第六子也，在虎林夜梦乘龙上天，回顾不见龙尾，失惊而觉。次日，孙楷、董朝至，拜请回都。行至曲阿，有一老人，自称姓干，名休，叩头言曰：“事久必变，愿殿下速行。”休谢之。行至布塞亭，孙恩将车驾来迎。休不敢乘辇，乃坐小车而入。百官拜迎道傍，休慌忙下车答礼。孙綝出令扶起，请入大殿，升御座即天子位。休再三谦让，方受玉玺。文官武将朝贺已毕，大赦天下，改元永安元年；封孙綝为丞相、荆州牧；多官各有封赏；又封兄之子孙皓为乌程侯。孙綝一门五侯，皆典禁兵，权倾人主。吴主孙休，恐其内变，阳示恩宠，内实防之。綝骄横愈甚。\n\n    冬十二月，奉牛酒入宫上寿，吴主孙休不受，綝怒，乃以牛酒诣左将军张布府中共饮。酒酣，乃谓布曰：“吾初废会稽王时，人皆劝吾为君。吾为今上贤，故立之。今我上寿而见拒，是将我等闲相待。吾早晚教你看！”布闻言，唯唯而已。次日，布入宫密奏孙休。休大惧，日夜不安。数日后，孙綝遣中书郎孟宗，拨与中营所管精兵一万五千，出屯武昌；又尽将武库内军器与之。于是，将军魏邈、武卫士施朔二人密奏孙休曰：“綝调兵在外，又搬尽武库内军器，早晚必为变矣。”休大惊，急召张布计议。布奏曰：“老将丁奉，计略过人，能断大事，可与议之。”休乃召奉入内，密告其事。奉奏曰：“陛下无忧。臣有一计，为国除害。”休问何计，奉曰：“来朝腊日，只推大会群臣，召綝赴席，臣自有调遣。”休大喜。奉同魏邈、施朔掌外事，张布为内应。\n\n    是夜，狂风大作，飞沙走石，将老树连根拔起。天明风定，使者奉旨来请孙綝入宫赴会。孙綝方起床，平地如人推倒，心中不悦。使者十余人，簇拥入内。家人止之曰：“一夜狂风不息，今早又无故惊倒，恐非吉兆，不可赴会。”綝曰：“吾弟兄共典禁兵，谁敢近身！倘有变动，于府中放火为号。”嘱讫，升车出内。吴主孙休忙下御座迎之，请綝高坐。酒行数巡，众惊曰：“宫外望有火起！”綝便欲起身。休止之曰：“丞相稳便。外兵自多，何足惧哉？”言未毕，左将军张布拔剑在手，\n######################\nOutput:",
