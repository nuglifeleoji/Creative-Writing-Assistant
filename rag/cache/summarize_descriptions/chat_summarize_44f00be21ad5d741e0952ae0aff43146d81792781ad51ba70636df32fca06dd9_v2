Despite her banishment from the order due to rebellious actions, she remains fiercely loyal to the Bene Gesserit and continues to serve its interests. Dortujla has played a pivotal role by delivering critical intelligence to the **Mother Superior**, demonstrating her unwavering commitment even in exile. Additionally, she represents the Bene Gesserit from surviving **Keeps**, indicating her continued involvement in the sisterhood's broader operations. While her banishment suggests past conflicts, her actions confirm her enduring allegiance and importance to the order.  \n\nThe **Bene Gesserit**, a matriarchal organization known for its political maneuvering and genetic programs, values Dortujla's contributions despite her disciplinary status. Her dual role—as both an exiled member and a trusted informant—highlights the complex, often contradictory nature of loyalty within the Bene Gesserit. Dortujla's story underscores the order's pragmatism, where even those formally cast out may still serve critical functions in its intricate schemes.  \n\nIn summary, **Dortujla** is a **banished yet loyal Reverend Mother** who maintains her ties to the **Bene Gesserit**, providing vital information and representing its interests from surviving Keeps.
