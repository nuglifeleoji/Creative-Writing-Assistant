“最后我把我的手机号码告诉他，叫他如果找不到公寓再跟我联络。通常如果有人好心到这种地步，一般人至少会怀疑一下，可是那家伙却丝毫没起疑心，可见他一定笨到家了。”\n    “那是因为谁也料想不到，一个初次见面的人竟会二话不说就对自己萌生杀意。”\n    “正因为初次见面，才更该觉得奇怪。可是那男的，把写有假住址的便纸条小心翼翼地往口袋一塞，就踏着轻快的步伐走了。我确定他走远后，就进屋开始准备。”说到这里，石神慢条斯理地伸手拿茶杯。茶应该已经凉了，不过他还是喝得津津有味。\n    “做什么准备？”草S催他往下说。\n    “也没什么大不了的，只是换一套便于行动的服装，等时间来临。这段时间，我开始思考怎么才能确实杀死他。经过多方检讨后，我选择了绞杀。我认为这个方法最万无一失。如果用刺杀或扑杀，谁知道到时会不会喷得满身是血。况且我也没把握能一招毙命。而且用绞杀的话，凶器也比较简单。不过，还是得选坚固一点的东西，所以我才决定用暖桌的电线。”\n    “为什么用电线？坚固的绳子应该还是很多种吧。”\n    “我本来也考虑过用领带或打包用的塑胶绳，可是两者握起来都容易滑手，而且也可能被扯松，还是暖桌的电线最适合。”\n    “于是您就带着那个去现场？”\n    石神点点头。\n    “十点左右，我走出家门。除了凶器，还准备了美工刀和抛弃式打火机。不过在前往车站的途中，我发现有人在垃圾场扔了一块蓝色塑胶布，就决定把那块布也折起来带去。然后我搭电车到瑞江车站，从那里坐计程车，前往旧江户川边。”\n    “瑞江车站？不是条崎？”\n    “如果在条崎下车，万一和那家伙碰个正着不就糟了。”石神爽快地回答。“我下计程车的地方，离我告诉他的地点还很远。总之一定要小心的，在达成目的之前，绝对不能让那家伙发现。”\n    “下了计程车之后呢？”\n    “我一边堤防着别人的耳目，一边朝那家伙即将现身的地点走去。不过其实也不用特别小心，路上根本没半个人影。”石神说着又喝了一口茶。“我到达堤防没多久，手机就响了，是他打来的。他说已经到了纸上抄的地点，可是怎么找都找不到那栋公寓。我问他现在在哪里，那家伙回答得可仔细了。我一边跟他讲电话，一边还得小心不让他察觉我正逐渐接近。我说我要再确认一下住址请等一下后就把电话挂了，其实那是我已确定那家伙的位置了。他正懒洋洋地坐在堤防边的草坪里。我蹑手蹑脚地缓�\n######################\nOutput:",
