不过，想想自己这假期和娜娜老师学习的进步，倒是也不怕她。\n\n    “呦，轩宇，十二级了哦。有进步，看起来没有偷懒。嗯，精神力也不错，进步的更多。三十二点精神力了。距离灵通境更进一步。很好，值得表扬。”秋雨馨第一个就给蓝轩宇测试了魂力和精神力。\n\n    而她并不知道的是，因为要分心去控制自己体内的金银旋涡，蓝轩宇的精神力测试是并不准确的。\n\n    正如秋雨馨预想的那样，还是有偷懒的，但紫萝分院毕竟是天斗学园直属，能考进这里的学生整体素质还是很高的。或多或少，在假期中都有一定的进步。\n\n    进行了所有测试之后正式上课，秋雨馨看了一眼认真听课的蓝轩宇，心中暗暗有些叹息。\n\n    这孩子按说先天满魂力，是最优秀的才是。可是，这已经一个学期过去了，魂力却只是提升了一级，这个速度可就慢了。按照这个速度的话，十二岁能不能达到二十级就很难说了。要是到不了，就没办法升入更好的学校。\n\n    蓝轩宇上课听的很认真，秋雨馨讲的东西和娜娜教的不一样，娜娜都是带着他实际修炼，秋雨馨讲的更多的是基础知识。\n\n    其实，对蓝轩宇触动最大的是当初娜娜控制着展现的九龙戏珠。他那时候才知道，魂师原来可以这么有趣、这么强大的。\n\n    兴趣的提升自然让他在学习时认真的多。\n\n    下午的实战课还是如约而至。\n\n    当蓝轩宇再次见到叶灵瞳的时候，叶灵瞳正脸色不善，气呼呼的看着他。\n\n    蓝轩宇刻意将目光转向其他方向不去看她，但叶灵瞳却已经主动走了过来。\n\n    “蓝轩宇，待会儿看我怎么收拾你。”叶灵瞳恶狠狠的道。\n\n    蓝轩宇撇了撇嘴，“也不知道是谁上次弄的一身水。”\n\n    叶灵瞳大怒，“这次才不会。爸爸已经教了我客服你对我影响的办法了。我的魂技只要有效，你一个十年魂技怎么可能打得过我。待会儿你就知道了！”\n\n    “集合！”老师的声音传来，两个班级的学生分别集合站队。\n\n    “实战课规则很简单。每个班每次派一名学生出场。输了的人淘汰，赢了的继续比赛，直到被淘汰为止。最后那个班先被全部淘汰，是为输掉实战课。输的班级，绕操场跑五圈。都听明白了吗？”一班班主任底气十足的说道。\n\n    虽说一年级的学员还小，很多甚至连魂技都还没有。但毕竟强攻系魂师的身体素质一般都要比控制系好\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
