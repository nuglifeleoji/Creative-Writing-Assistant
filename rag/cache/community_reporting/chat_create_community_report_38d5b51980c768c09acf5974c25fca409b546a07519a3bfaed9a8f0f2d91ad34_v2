Once the sole source of the spice melange, Rakis remains central to the power struggles between factions like the Bene Gesserit, the Tleilaxu, and the Honored Matres. It is home to the giant sandworms, which produce melange, and is deeply tied to the legacy of the Tyrant Leto II, the God Emperor, who transformed into a sandworm and ruled here.  \n\nRakis serves as the heart of the Bene Gesserit’s operations, housing their stronghold in the holy city of Keen and a Keep where they maintain influence. The planet is also the center of religious worship for the Holy Church of the Divided God, with priests and attendants venerating Shai-Hulud (the sandworms). Key figures like Sheeana Brugh, a girl capable of controlling the worms, reside here, making her pivotal to the Bene Gesserit’s designs.  \n\nHistorically, Rakis was destroyed by the Honored Matres, who eradicated its sandworms—an event of catastrophic cultural and economic consequence. Before its destruction, it was a hub for spice production, though the Bene Tleilax later replicated melange in tanks, diminishing Rakis' monopoly. The planet’s cities, such as Dar-es-Balat and Onn, hold archaeological and political importance, including the discovery of Leto II’s journals.  \n\nDespite its ruined state, Rakis remains a symbol of the Tyrant’s Golden Path and a focal point for interstellar conflict, with Duncan Idaho and other key players being drawn into its orbit.
