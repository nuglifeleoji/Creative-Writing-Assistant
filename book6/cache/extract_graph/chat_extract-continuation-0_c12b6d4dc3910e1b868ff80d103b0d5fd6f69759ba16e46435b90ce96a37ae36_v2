正处于像太阳一样的稳定期，是绝对不可能成为爆发新星的。而且我们观测到了它被摧毁的过程：一个接近光速的物体击中了187J3X1，那东西体积很小，他们把它叫光粒，它穿过恒星外围气层的那一瞬间才从尾迹被观测到，光粒虽然体积小，但由于十分接近光速，它的质量被相对论效应急剧放大，击中目标时已经达到187J3X1 恒星的八分之一，结果立刻摧毁了这恒星，187J3X1 的四颗行星也在爆炸中被汽化。”\n　　罗辑抬头看看，今天的夜空漆黑一片，几乎一颗星都看不到。他向前走去，人们站起身来，默默地给他让开路，但人群立刻在他身后合拢，每个人都想挤到前面来离他近些，像寒冷中渴望得到阳光一样，然而还是敬畏地给他留出一圈空间，形成了荧光海洋中一个台风眼般的黑斑。有一个人扑进来伏在罗辑前面，使得他只得停下脚步，那人就去吻他的脚。又有几个人也进入圈里来做同样的事，局面就要失控之际，从人群中响起了几声呵斥，那几个人慌乱地起身缩回人群中去了。\n　　罗辑继续向前走。这才发现自己也不知道要去哪儿，于是又站住了，抬头在人群中找到了希恩斯和乔纳森，向他们走去。\n　　“那我现在该做什么？”罗辑来到两人面前问。\n　　“您是面壁者，当然可以做面壁法案范围内的任何事。”希恩斯向罗辑鞠躬说，“虽然仍有法案原则的限制，但您现在几乎可以调动地球国际的一切资源。”\n　　“包括舰队国际的资源。”乔纳森补充说。\n　　罗辑想了想说：“我现在不需要调动任何资源，但如果我真恢复了面壁法案赋予的权力的话……”\n　　“这毫无疑问！”希恩斯说，乔纳森跟着点点头。\n　　“那就提出两项要求：第一，所有城市恢复秩序，恢复正常生活。这要求没什么神秘之处。大家都能理解吧。”\n　　所有人都连连点头，有人说：“我的神，全世界都在听着呢。”\n　　“是的，全世界都在听着。”希恩斯说，“恢复稳定需要时间，但因为有您在，我们相信能做到的。”他的话也引起了人们的纷纷附和。\n　　“第二，所有人都回家吧，让这里安静下来。谢谢！”\n　　听到罗辑这句话，人们都沉默了，但很快一阵嗡嗡声响起，他的话从人群中向后传。人群开始散开，开始散得很慢很不情愿，但渐渐中快了起来，一\n######################\nOutput:",
