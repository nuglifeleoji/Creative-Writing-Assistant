\n　　这不是他田福堂反报复！这是他们自家人告他哩！田福堂这样想的时候，就对辣女人马来花和颜悦色地说：“你反映的情况我知道了。这要会议上处理，我田福堂一个人处理不了。你先回去。要是会议处理不了，你再闹也不迟嘛！村里解决不了，你不会到石圪节乡上去？好，就这样。你路过给玉亭捎个话，叫他到我这里来一下……” \n　　马来花走后不久，得到口讯的孙玉亭就一路小跑着来了。他好长时间都没有得到过福堂的召唤，因此情绪异常地激动，直跑得人还未到，一只烂鞋就飞到了田福堂的面前。玉亭来到破碾盘前，把那只先到的鞋重新拖拉到光脚上，问：“什么事？” \n　　田福堂等一阵咳嗽过后，才说了马来花告金光亮的事。“嗨，村里这种事太多了！如今吃是吃好了，但问题也越来越多了。许多纠纷一直搁着没解决……”孙玉亭跹蹴在田福堂对面，大为感叹地说。 \n　　“我想咱们开个支部会，对有些事总得做个处理。咱们大概一两年都没开个支部会了……” \n　　孙玉亭一听说要开会，兴奋地一下子从地上站起来。啊啊，他已经不开会很久了，甚至对开会都有点想念哩！ \n　　孙玉亭兴奋之余，也有点惊讶：超脱了几年的支书为什么突然心血来潮，对工作积极起来？是不是他有了“内部消息”，政策要转变呀？可能哩！他弟弟已经成了省上的大官，说不定写信给他透露了些什么！ \n　　田福堂当即从裤带上解下大队部公窑门上的钥匙，交给孙玉亭，说：“你把会议室收拾一下，再给俊山、俊武和海民通知到，叫他们晚上来开支部会。” \n　　“要不要扩大一下？” \n　　“不了！这是我们党的会议嘛！”田福堂断然否定了玉亭的意见。 \n　　福堂知道，扩大一下，就把孙少安也“扩大”进来了，在这些“政治问题”上，他依然透彻的精明，说实话，在双水村只有孙少安才使他感到了一种真正的威胁。尤其是眼下，这小子已经成了双水村头号财主，而且乡上县上都有了名气。他田福堂虽然再折不断这小子的翅膀，但在他的权力范围内，能排斥他的地方，他绝不会放过；哪怕给他制造一点小小的不满足哟！哼，你小子有钱有名，可村子里的事你连毛也沾不上根！我们开党支部会议，你小子社员（他习惯这个称呼）一样，站到圈外去吧！ \n　　孙玉亭也不在乎扩大不扩大——反正有他能参加上哩！ \n　　尽管到了农忙季节，地里有一大堆活，但孙玉亭下午不\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂 is a local leader who
