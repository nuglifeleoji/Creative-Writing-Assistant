The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though. That is the Story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.”\n“As the Emperor wishes it,” Rabban said.\n“As the Emperor wishes it.”\n“What about the smugglers?”\n“No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At any rate, you'll be Spreading some bribes in that quarter...and taking other measures which I’m sure you can think of.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are—slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest vestige of pity or mercy must you show them.”\n“Can one exterminate an entire planet?” Rabban asked.\n“Exterminate?” Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron’s head. “Who said anything about exterminating?”\n“Well, | presumed you were going to bring in new stock and—”\n“| said squeeze, Nephew, not exterminate. Don’t waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy.” He smiled, a baby’s expression in the dimple-fat face. “A Carnivore never stops. Show no mercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry and thirsty.” The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. “Like me.”\n“I see, m’Lord.”\nRabban swung his gaze left and right.\n“It’s all clear then, Nephew?”\n“Except for one thing, Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes.”\n“Ah, yes, Kynes.”\n“He’s the Emperor’s man, m’Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he’s very close to the Fremen...married one.”\n“Kynes will be dead by tomorrow's nightfall.”\n“That’s dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant.”\n“How do you think I’ve come this far this quickly?” the Baron demanded. His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. “Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You’re forgetting that he’s addicted to the spice.”\n“Of course!”\n“Those who know will do nothing to endanger their Supply,” the Baron said. “Kynes certainly must know.”\n“I forgot,” Rabban said.\nThey stared at each other in silence.\nPresently, the Baron said: “Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of your first concerns. I’ve quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Duke’s men got most of what we’d stored for sale.”\nRabban nodded. “Yes, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron brightened. “Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains of organization here and you'll say to them: ‘Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.’”\n“I understand, m’Lord.”\n“This time, I’m sure you do. We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow. Now, leave me to finish my Sleep.”\nThe Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight.\nA tank-brain, the Baron thought.

Really a lovely boy.\nAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.\n—FROM “A CHILD'S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: Paul fought the ’thopter’s controls, he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional vortex.\nThe cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his inner sense began to see through the curtain.\nI must find the right vortex, he thought.\nFor a long time now he had sensed the storm’s power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.\nThe vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the ‘thopter left.\nJessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.\n“Paul!” she screamed.\nThe vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the ‘thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out—a winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.\nPaul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert— moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.\n“We're out of it,” Jessica whispered.\nPaul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.\n“We've given them the slip,” he said.\nJessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.\nIt was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It’s gone, but we remain.\n“I don’t like the sound of our wing motion,” Paul said. “We suffered some damage in there.”\nHe felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation.\nHe shivered.\nThe sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was the Sspice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the words had a power of their own.\n“| shall not fear...”\nCause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self- awareness that could not have been without the litany’s magic.\nWords from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: “What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?”\n“There’s rock all around,” Jessica said.\nPaul focused on the ‘thopter’s launching, shook his head to clear it. He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm’s doing.\n“Better set us down on sand,” Jessica said. “The wings might not take full brake.”\nHe nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes. “I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your Safety harness.”\nShe obeyed, thinking: We’ve water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we can do.\n“Run for those rocks the instant we’re stopped,” Paul said. “lIl take the pack.”\n“Run for....” She fell silent, nodded. “Worms.”\n“Our friends, the worms,” he corrected her. “They'll get this ’thopter. There'll be no evidence of where we landed.”\nHow direct his thinking, she thought.\nThey glided lower...lower...\nThere came a rushing sense of motion to their passage—blurred shadows of dunes, rocks lifting like islands. The ‘thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.\nHe’s killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence.\n“Brace yourself!” Paul warned.\nHe pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder. He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings’ leaves.\nAbruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the ‘thopter. The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.\nPaul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and out onto the ‘thopter’s metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its straps.\n“Run!” he ordered.\nHe pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.\nJessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune. She heard Paul’s panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.\n“Follow the ridge,” Paul ordered. “It’ll be faster.”\nThey slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.\nA new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering.\n“Worm,” Paul said.\nIt grew louder.\n“Faster!” Paul gasped.\nThe first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.\nPaul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother’s arm with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\n“I can’t run any farther,” Jessica panted.\nPaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in- motion ran parallel to their rock island—moonlit ripples, Sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul’s eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once—a short\nloop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.\nWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\nThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.\n“It’s bigger than a Guild spaceship,” Paul whispered. “I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but |", " arm with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel.

They listened until the sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them.\nPaul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon- frosted escarpment, and quoted from the Kitab al- Ibar: “Travel by night and rest in black shade through the day.” He looked at his mother. “We still have a few hours of night. Can you go on?”\n“In a moment.”\nPaul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.\n“Whenever you're ready,” he said.\nShe pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. “Which direction?”\n“Where this ridge leads.” He pointed.\n“Deep into the desert,” she said.\n“The Fremen desert,” Paul whispered.\nAnd he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But\nthe set of the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.\nIdaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.\n“Do you see a way to go?” Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.\n“No,” he said. “But we'll go anyway.”\nHe settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a Sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south.\nPaul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.\nShe noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and particular—the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were Slowed, the wind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go over or go around? The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.\n“Careful here—this ledge is slippery with sand.”\n“Watch you don’t hit your head against this overhang.”\n“Stay below this ridge; the moon’s at our backs and it’d show our movement to anyone out there.”\nPaul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.\nJessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It tasted brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan —a tall fountain enclosing a curve of sky, sucha richness of moisture that it hadn’t been noticed for itself...only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside it.\nTo stop, she thought. To rest...truly rest.\nIt occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.\nPaul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping surface. Jessica followed with a sigh.\nThey slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a Sheer rock face. Again, they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.\nJessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in substances beneath their feet and hands—boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.\nThe powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock flakes cut.\nAnd the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.\nPaul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled into him.\nHe was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred meters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves —shadows of angles that lapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment.\n“Open desert,” she said.\n“A wide place to cross,” Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face.\nJessica glanced left and right—nothing but sand below.\nPaul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of shadows in the moon’s passage. “About three or four kilometers across,” he said.\n“Worms,” she said.\n“Sure to be.”\nShe focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. “Shall we rest and eat?”\nPaul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him. She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.\n“Here,” he said.\nHis hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm.\nShe swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.\n“Drink all your water,” Paul said. “Axiom: the best place to conserve your water is in your body. It keeps\nyour energy up. You’re stronger. Trust your stillsuit.”\nShe obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she recalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, “Better a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife.”\nJessica repeated the words to Paul.\n“That was Gurney,” he said.\nShe caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead, thought: And well poor Gurney might be dead. The Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.\n“Gurney always had the right quotation,” Paul said. “I can hear him now: ‘And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.’”\nJessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her son’s voice.\nPresently, Paul said: “How do you...feel?”\nShe recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: “Your sister won’t be born for many months yet. | still feel...physically adequate.”\nAnd she thought: How stiffly formal | speak to my own son! Then, because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she searched and found the source of her formality: /’m afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; | fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.\nPaul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds of the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.\n“There’s melange spice nearby,” he said.\nAn eider wind feathered Paul’s cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose. But this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference.\n“Dawn soon,” he said.\nJessica nodded.\n“There’s a way to get safely across that open sand,” Paul said. “The Fremen do it.”\n“The worms?”\n“If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,” Paul said. “It'd keep a worm occupied for a time.”\nShe glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment. “Four kilometers’ worth of time?”\n“Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that don’t attract the worms....”\nPaul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had come with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive terror at thought of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared...if...if....\nHe shook his head.\n“It'd have to be sounds without rhythm,” Jessica said.\n“What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps...the sand itself must shift down at times. Worms can’t investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested before we try it, though.”\nHe looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the vertical moonshadows there. “It’ll be dawn within the hour.”\n“Where’ll we spend the day?” she asked.\nPaul turned left, pointed. “The cliff curves back north over there. You can see by the way it’s wind-cut that’s the windward face. There'll be crevasses there, deep ones.”\n“Had we better get started?” she asked.\nHe stood, helped her to her feet. “Are you rested enough for a climb down? | want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp.”\n“Enough.” She nodded for him to lead the way.\nHe hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff.\nIf only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. /t’d be such a simple matter to jump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.\nThey came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.\nPaul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world\nof deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The fissure narrowed to some ten meters’ width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.\n“Can we go down?” Jessica whispered.\n“I think so.” He tested the surface with one foot. “We can slide down,” he said. “lIl go first. Wait\nuntil you hear me stop.”\n“Careful,” she said.\nHe stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.\nThere came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away to silence.\n“Mother?” he said.\nThere was no answer.\n“Mother?”\nHe dropped the", "rying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world\nof deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The fissure narrowed to some ten meters’ width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.\n“Can we go down?” Jessica whispered.\n“I think so.” He tested the surface with one foot. “We can slide down,” he said. “lIl go first. Wait\nuntil you hear me stop.”\n“Careful,” she said.\nHe stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.\nThere came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away to silence.\n“Mother?” he said.\nThere was no answer.\n“Mother?”\nHe dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging, throwing sand like a wild man. “Mother!” he gasped. “Mother, where are you?”\nAnother cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He wrenched himself out of it.\nShe’s been caught in the sandslide, he thought. Buried in it. | must be calm and work this out carefully. She won't smother immediately. She'll\ncompose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows l'Il dig for her.\nIn the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments could write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed itself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall.\nPresently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig, moving the sand with care not to dislodge another Slide. A piece of fabric came under his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm, exposed her face.\n“Do you hear me?” he whispered.\nNo answer.\nHe dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he detected a slow heartbeat.\nBindu suspension, he told himself.\nHe cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could, feeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with the effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls.\nHe stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert’s marching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.\nShe awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.\n“I knew you'd find me,” she whispered.\nHe looked back up the fissure. “It might have been kinder if | hadn’t.”\n“Paul!”\n“ĮI lost the pack,” he said. “It’s buried under a hundred tons of sand...at least.”\n“Everything?”\n“The spare water, the stilltent—everything that counts.” He touched a pocket. “I still have the paracompass.” He fumbled at the waist sash. “Knife and binoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we'll die.”\nIn that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the open desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks.\nBut Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul’s face. She edged her voice with scorn, said: “Is this the way you were taught?”\n“Don’t you understand?” he asked. “Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand.”\n“You found me,” she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.\nPaul squatted back on his heels.\nPresently, he looked up the fissure at the new Slope, studying it, marking the looseness of the sand.\n“If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a hole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack. Water might do it, but we don’t have enough water for....” He broke off, then: “Foam.”\nJessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind.\nPaul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as his eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them.\n“Spice,” he said. “Its essence—highly alkaline. And | have the paracompass. Its power pack is acid-base.”\nJessica sat up straight against the rock.\nPaul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the desert’s floor.\nShe watched the way he walked, breaking his stride—step...pause, step-step...slide...pause...\nThere was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here.\nPaul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his knife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts on it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism\ncame out next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument.\n“You'll need water,” Jessica said.\nPaul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it into the dished compartment.\nIf this fails, that’s water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won’t matter then, anyway.\nWith his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the water. They foamed Slightly, subsided.\nJessica’s eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of hawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the open water.\nGreat Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!\nPaul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button which gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in one hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying the lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He waded part way up the slope, kicking off the sand rivulets, spurts of dust.\nPresently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass, shook the instrument case.\nGreen foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.\nJessica moved to a position below him, called out: “May | help?”\n“Come up and dig,” he said. “We've about three meters to go. It’s going to be a near thing.” As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.\n“Quickly,” Paul said. “No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.”\nJessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into the hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.\nAs Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the sand down the slope. “How deep?” she panted.\n“About three meters,” he said. “And | can only approximate the position. We may have to widen this hole.” He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand. “Slant your digging backward. Don’t go straight down.”\nJessica obeyed.\nSlowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack.\nCould I have miscalculated? Paul asked himself. I’m the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?\nHe looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained.\nJessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam- stained hand across her cheek. Her eyes met Paul’s. “The upper face,” Paul said. “Gently, now.” He\nadded another pinch of spice to the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica’s hands as she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole.\nOn the second pass, her hands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of Strap with a plastic buckle.\n“Don’t move any more of it,” Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.\n“We're out of foam.”\nJessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.\nPaul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said: “Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I’m going to pull you to the side and downhill. Don’t let go of that strap. We won't get much more spill from the top. This slope has Stabilized itself. All I’m going to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand. Once that hole’s filled, we can dig you out and pull up the pack.”\n“I understand,” she said.\n“Ready?”\n“Ready.” She tensed her fingers on the strap.\nWith one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had subsided, Jessica remained buried to the waist, her left arm and Shoulder still under the sand, her chin protected on a fold of Paul’s robe. Her shoulder ached from the Strain put on it.\n“I still have the strap,” she said.\nSlowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap. “Together,” he said. “Steady pressure. We mustn’t break it.”\nMore sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared the surface, Paul stopped,\nfreed his mother from the sand. Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.\nIn a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them.\nPaul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked to her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand.\n“You look a mess,” he said.\n“You're not so pretty yourself,” she said.\nThey started to laugh, then sobered.\n“That shouldn’t have happened,” Paul said. “I was careless.”\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.\n“I'll put up the tent,” he said. “Better slip off that robe and shake it out.” He turned away, taking the pack.\nJessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.\n“There’s anchor holes in the rock,” Paul said. “Someone's tented here before.”\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place—deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away—far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.\nShe turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere blending with the rock"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_5079f7e212070121f15717346731562b77fa2439673a7bef5b686fa83c9f92a9_v2"}
