chance involvement of inanimate matter. His own will was no more than a subtle, shifting thing. It lived without breath and was intelligible only as an inward illumination.\nWith a clarity born of desperation, he broke through the gauze curtain with the lonely sense of sight. His attention focused like a blazing light under Bijaz. Hayt felt that his eyes cut through layers of the dwarf, seeing the little man as a hired intellect, and beneath that, a creature imprisoned by hungers and cravings which lay huddled in the eyes— layer after layer, until finally, there was only an entity- aspect being manipulated by symbols.\n“We are upon a battleground,” Bijaz said. “You may speak of it.”\nHis voice freed by the command, Hayt said: “You cannot force me to slay Muad’Dib.”\n“I have heard the Bene Gesserit say,” Bijaz said, “that there is nothing firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the universe—that nothing remains in its state, that each day, sometimes each hour, brings change.”\nHayt shook his head dumbly from side to side.\n“You believed the silly Emperor was the prize we sought,” Bijaz said. “How little you understand our masters, the Tleilaxu. The Guild and Bene Gesserit believe we produce artifacts. In reality, we produce tools and services. Anything can be a tool—poverty, war. War is useful because it is effective in so many areas. It stimulates the metabolism. It enforces government. It diffuses genetic strains. It possesses a vitality such as nothing else in the universe. Only those who recognize the value of war and exercise it have any degree of self-determination.”\nIn an oddly placid voice, Hayt said: “Strange thoughts coming from you, almost enough to make me believe ina vengeful Providence. What restitution was exacted to create you? It would make a fascinating story, doubtless with an even more extraordinary epilogue.”\n“Magnificent!” Bijaz chortled. “You attack—therefore you have willpower and exercise self-determination.”\n“You're trying to awaken violence in me,” Hayt said in a panting voice.\nBijaz denied this with a shake of the head. “Awaken, yes; violence, no. You are a disciple of awareness by training, so you have said. | have an awareness to awaken in you, Duncan Idaho.”\n“Hayt!”\n“Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldier. Atreides field-hand on the field of battle. Duncan Idaho.”\n“The past cannot be awakened.”\n“Cannot?”\n“It has never been done!”\n“True, but our masters defy the idea that something cannot be done. Always, they seek the proper tool, the right application of effort, the services of the proper—”\n“You hide your real purpose! You throw up a screen of words and they mean nothing!”\n“There is a Duncan Idaho in you,” Bijaz said. “It will submit to emotion or to dispassionate examination, but submit it will. This awareness will rise through a screen of Suppression and selection out of the dark past which dogs your footsteps. It goads you even now while it holds you back. There exists that being within you upon which awareness must focus and which you will obey.”\n“The Tleilaxu think I’m still their slave, but I—”\n“Quiet, slave!” Bijaz said in that whining voice.\nHayt found himself frozen in silence.\n“Now we are down to bedrock,” Bijaz said. “I know you feel it. And these are the power-words to manipulate you... | think they will have sufficient leverage.”\nHayt felt the perspiration pouring down his cheeks, the trembling of his chest and arms, but he was powerless to move.\n“One day,” Bijaz said, “the Emperor will come to you. He will say: ‘She is gone.’ The grief mask will occupy his face. He will give water to the dead, as they call their tears hereabouts. And you will say, using my voice: ‘Master! Oh, Master!”\nHayt’s jaw and throat ached with the locking of his muscles. He could only twist his head in a brief arc from side to side.\n“You will say, ‘I carry a message from Bijaz.’” The dwarf grimaced. “Poor Bijaz, who has no mind... poor Bijaz, a drum stuffed with messages, an essence for others to use ... pound on Bijaz and he produces a noise...”\nAgain, he grimaced. “You think me a hypocrite, Duncan Idaho! | am not! | can grieve, too. But the time has come to substitute swords for words.”\nA hiccup shook Hayt.\nBijaz giggled, then: “Ah, thank you, Duncan, thank you. The demands of the body save us. As the Emperor carries the blood of the Harkonnens in his veins, he will do as we\ndemand. He will turn into a spitting machine, a biter of words that ring with a lovely noise to our masters.”\nHayt blinked, thinking how the dwarf appeared like an alert little animal, a thing of spite and rare intelligence. Harkonnen blood in the Atreides?\n“You think of Beast Rabban, the vile Harkonnen, and you glare,” Bijaz said. “You are like the Fremen in this. When words fail, the sword is always at hand, eh? You think of the torture inflicted upon your family by the Harkonnens. And, through his mother, your precious Paul is a Harkonnen! You would not find it difficult to slay a Harkonnen, now would you?”\nBitter frustration coursed through the ghola. Was it anger? Why should this cause anger?\n“Ohhh,” Bijaz said, and: “Ahhhh, hah! Click-click. There is more to the message. It is a trade the Tleilaxu offer your precious Paul Atreides. Our masters will restore his beloved. A sister to yourself—another ghola.”\nHayt felt suddenly that he existed in a universe occupied only by his own heartbeats.\n“A ghola,” Bijaz said. “It will be the flesh of his beloved. She will bear his children. She will love only him. We can even improve on the original if he so desires. Did ever a man have greater opportunity to regain what he’d lost? It is a bargain he will leap to strike.”\nBijaz nodded, eyes drooping as though tiring. Then: “He will be tempted... and in his distraction, you will move close. In the instant, you will strike! Two gholas, not one! That is what our masters demand!” The dwarf cleared his throat, nodded once more, said: “Speak.”\n“I will not do it,” Hayt said.\n“But Duncan Idaho would,” Bijaz said. “It will be the moment of supreme vulnerability for this descendant of the Harkonnens. Do not forget this. You will suggest improvements to his beloved—perhaps a deathless heart, gentler emotions. You will offer asylum as you move close to\nhim—a planet of his choice somewhere beyond the Imperium. Think of it! His beloved restored. No more need for tears, and a place of idyls to live out his years.”\n“A costly package,” Hayt said, probing. “He'll ask the price.”\n“Tell him he must renounce his godhead and discredit the Qizarate. He must discredit himself, his sister.”\n“Nothing more?” Hayt asked, sneering.\n“He must relinquish his CHOAM holdings, naturally.”\n“Naturally.”\n“And if you’re not yet close enough to strike, speak of how much the Tleilaxu admire what he has taught them about the possibilities of religion. Tell him the Tleilaxu have a department of religious engineering, shaping religions to particular needs.”\n“How very clever,” Hayt said.\n“You think yourself free to sneer and disobey me,” Bijaz said. He cocked his head slyly to one side. “Don’t deny Ree\n“They made you well, little animal,” Hayt said.\n“And you as well,” the dwarf said. “You will tell him to hurry. Flesh decays and her flesh must be preserved in a cryological tank.”\nHayt felt himself floundering, caught in a matrix of objects he could not recognize. The dwarf appeared so sure of himself! There had to be a flaw in the Tleilaxu logic. In making their ghola, they’d keyed him to the voice of Bijaz, but... But what? Logic/matrix/ object .. . How easy it was to mistake clear reasoning for correct reasoning! Was Tleilaxu logic distorted?\nBijaz smiled, listened as though to a hidden voice. “Now, you will forget,” he said. “When the moment comes, you will remember. He will say: ‘She is gone.’ Duncan Idaho will awaken then.”\nThe dwarf clapped his hands together.\nHayt grunted, feeling that he had been interrupted in the middle of a thought... or perhaps in the middle of a sentence. What was it? Something about... targets?\n“You think to confuse me and manipulate me,” he said.\n“How is that?” Bijaz asked.\n“lam your target and you can’t deny it,” Hayt said.\n“I would not think of denying it.”\n“What is it you'd try to do with me?”\n“A kindness,” Bijaz said. “A simple kindness.”\nThe sequential nature of actual events is not illuminated with lengthy precision by the powers of prescience except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The oracle grasps incidents cut out of the historic chain. Eternity moves. It inflicts itself upon the oracle and the supplicant alike. Let Muad’Dib’s subjects doubt his majesty and his oracular visions. Let them deny his powers. Let them never doubt Eternity.\n—THE DUNE GOSPELS\nH ayt watched Alia emerge from her temple and cross the plaza. Her guard was bunched close, fierce expressions on their faces to mask the lines molded by good living and complacency.\nA heliograph of ’thopter wings flashed in the bright afternoon sun above the temple, part of the Royal Guard with Muad’Dib’s fist-symbol on its fuselage.\nHayt returned his gaze to Alia. She looked out of place here in the city, he thought. Her proper setting was the desert—open, untrammeled space. An odd thing about her came back to him as he watched her approach: Alia appeared thoughtful only when she smiled. It was a trick of the eyes, he decided, recalling a cameo memory of her as she'd appeared at the reception for the Guild Ambassador: haughty against a background of music and brittle conversation among extravagant gowns and uniforms. And Alia had been wearing white, dazzling, a bright garment of chastity. He had looked down upon her from a window as she crossed an inner garden with its formal pond, its fluting fountains, fronds of pampas grass and a white belvedere.\nEntirely wrong ... all wrong. She belonged in the desert.\nHayt drew in a ragged breath. Alia had moved out of his view then as she did now. He waited, clenching and unclenching his fists. The interview with Bijaz had left him uneasy.\nHe heard Alia’s entourage pass outside the room where he waited. She went into the Family quarters.\nNow he tried to focus on the thing about her which troubled him. The way she’d walked across the plaza? Yes. She’d moved like a hunted creature fleeing some predator. He stepped out onto the connecting balcony, walked along it behind the plasmeld sunscreen, stopped while still in concealing shadows. Alia stood at the balustrade overlooking her temple.\nHe looked where she was looking", " down upon her from a window as she crossed an inner garden with its formal pond, its fluting fountains, fronds of pampas grass and a white belvedere.\nEntirely wrong ... all wrong.

She’d moved like a hunted creature fleeing some predator. He stepped out onto the connecting balcony, walked along it behind the plasmeld sunscreen, stopped while still in concealing shadows. Alia stood at the balustrade overlooking her temple.\nHe looked where she was looking—out over the city. He saw rectangles, blocks of color, creeping movements of life and sound. Structures gleamed, shimmered. Heat patterns spiraled off the rooftops. There was a boy across the way bouncing a ball in a cul-de-sac formed by a buttressed massif at a corner of the temple. Back and forth the ball went.\nAlia, too, watched the ball. She felt a compelling identity with that ball—back and forth .. . back and forth. She sensed herself bouncing through corridors of Time.\nThe potion of melange she’d drained just before leaving the temple was the largest she’d ever attempted—a massive overdose. Even before beginning to take effect, it had terrified her.\nWhy did I do it? she asked herself.\nOne made a choice between dangers. Was that it? This was the way to penetrate the fog spread over the future by that damnable Dune Tarot. A barrier existed. It must be breached. She had acted out of a necessity to see where it was her brother walked with his eyeless stride.\nThe familiar melange fugue state began creeping into her awareness. She took a deep breath, experienced a brittle form of calm, poised and selfless.\nPossession of second sight has a tendency to make one a dangerous fatalist, she thought. Unfortunately, there existed no abstract leverage, no calculus of prescience. Visions of\nthe future could not be manipulated as formulas. One had to enter them, risking life and sanity.\nA figure moved from the harsh shadows of the adjoining balcony. The ghola! In her heightened awareness, Alia saw him with intense clarity—the dark, lively features dominated by those glistening metal eyes. He was a union of terrifying opposites, something put together in a shocking linear way. He was shadow and blazing light, a product of the process which had revived his dead flesh... and of something intensely pure... innocent.\nHe was innocence under siege!\n“Have you been there all along, Duncan?” she asked.\n“So I’m to be Duncan,” he said. “Why?”\n“Don’t question me,” she said.\nAnd she thought, looking at him, that the Tleilaxu had left no corner of their ghola unfinished.\n“Only gods can safely risk perfection,” she said. “It’s a dangerous thing for a man.”\n“Duncan died,” he said, wishing she would not call him that. “I am Hayt.”\nShe studied his artificial eyes, wondering what they saw. Observed closely, they betrayed tiny black pockmarks, little wells of darkness in the glittering metal. Facets! The universe shimmered around her and lurched. She steadied herself with a hand on the sun-warmed surface of the balustrade. Ahhh, the melange moved swiftly.\n“Are you ill?” Hayt asked. He moved closer, the steely eyes opened wide, staring.\nWho spoke? she wondered. Was it Duncan Idaho? Was it the mentat-ghola or the Zensunni philosopher? Or was ita Tleilaxu pawn more dangerous than any Guild Steersman? Her brother knew.\nAgain, she looked at the ghola. There was something inactive about him now, a latent something. He was saturated with waiting and with powers beyond their common life.\n“Out of my mother, | am like the Bene Gesserit,” she said. “Do you know that?”\n“I know it.”\n“Į use their powers, think as they think. Part of me knows the sacred urgency of the breeding program... and its products.”\nShe blinked, feeling part of her awareness begin to move freely in Time.\n“It’s said that the Bene Gesserit never let go,” he said. And he watched her closely, noting how white her knuckles were where she gripped the edge of the balcony.\n“Have | stumbled?” she asked.\nHe marked how deeply she breathed, with tension in every movement, the glazed appearance of her eyes.\n“When you stumble,” he said, “you may regain your balance by jumping beyond the thing that tripped you.”\n“The Bene Gesserit stumbled,” she said. “Now they wish to regain their balance by leaping beyond my brother. They want Chani’s baby... or mine.”\n“Are you with child?”\nShe struggled to fix herself in a timespace relationship to this question. With child? When? Where?\n“I see... my child,” she whispered.\nShe moved away from the balcony’s edge, turned her head to look at the ghola. He had a face of salt, bitter eyes —two circles of glistening lead... and, as he turned away from the light to follow her movement, blue shadows.\n“What ...do you see with such eyes?” she whispered.\n“What other eyes see,” he said.\nHis words rang in her ears, stretching her awareness. She felt that she reached across the universe—such a stretching ... out... out. She lay intertwined with all Time.\n“You've taken the spice, a large dose,” he said.\n“Why can’t | see him?” she muttered. The womb of all creation held her captive. “Tell me, Duncan, why I cannot see him.”\n“Who can’t you see?”\n“I cannot see the father of my children. I’m lost in a Tarot fog. Help me.”\nMentat logic offered its prime computation, and he said: “The Bene Gesserit want a mating between you and your brother. It would lock the genetic...”\nA wail escaped her. “The egg in the flesh,” she gasped. A sensation of chill swept over her, followed by intense heat. The unseen mate of her darkest dreams! Flesh of her flesh that the oracle could not reveal—would it come to that?\n“Have you risked a dangerous dose of the spice?” he asked. Something within him fought to express the utmost terror at the thought that an Atreides woman might die, that Paul might face him with the knowledge that a female of the royal family had... gone.\n“You don’t know what it’s like to hunt the future,” she said. “Sometimes | glimpse myself... but I get in my own way. | cannot see through myself.” She lowered her head, shook it from side to side.\n“How much of the spice did you take?” he asked.\n“Nature abhors prescience,” she said, raising her head. “Did you know that, Duncan?”\nHe spoke softly, reasonably, as to a small child: “Tell me how much of the spice you took.” He took hold of her shoulder with his left hand.\n“Words are such gross machinery, so primitive and ambiguous,” she said. She pulled away from his hand.\n“You must tell me,” he said.\n“Look at the Shield Wall,” she commanded, pointing. She sent her gaze along her own outstretched hand, trembled as the landscape crumbled in an overwhelming vision—a sandcastle destroyed by invisible waves. She averted her eyes, was transfixed by the appearance of the ghola’s face. His features crawled, became aged, then young... aged... young. He was life itself, assertive, endless... She turned to flee, but he grabbed her left wrist.\n“Lam going to summon a doctor,” he said.\n“No! You must let me have the vision! | have to know!”\n“You are going inside now,” he said.\nShe stared down at his hand. Where their flesh touched, she felt an electric presence that both lured and frightened her. She jerked free, gasped: “You can’t hold the whirlwind!”\n“You must have medical help!” he snapped.\n“Don’t you understand?” she demanded. “My vision’s incomplete, just fragments. It flickers and jumps. | have to remember the future. Can’t you see that?”\n“What is the future if you die?” he asked, forcing her gently into the Family chambers.\n“Words ... words,” she muttered. “I can’t explain it. One thing is the occasion of another thing, but there’s no cause ...no effect. We can’t leave the universe as it was. Try aS we may, there’s a gap.”\n“Stretch out here,” he commanded.\nHe is so dense! she thought.\nCool shadows enveloped her. She felt her own muscles crawling like worms—a firm bed that she knew to be insubstantial. Only space was permanent. Nothing else had substance. The bed flowed with many bodies, all of them her own. Time became a multiple sensation, overloaded. It presented no single reaction for her to abstract. It was Time. It moved. The whole universe slipped backward, forward, sideways.\n“It has no thing-aspect,” she explained. “You can’t get under it or around it. There’s no place to get leverage.”\nThere came a fluttering of people all around her. Many someones held her left hand. She looked at her own moving flesh, followed a twining arm out to a fluid mask of face: Duncan Idaho! His eyes were... wrong, but it was Duncan —child-man-adolescent-child-man-adolescent . . . Every line of his features betrayed concern for her.\n“Duncan, don’t be afraid,” she whispered.\nHe squeezed her hand, nodded. “Be still,” he said.\nAnd he thought: She must not die! She must not! No Atreides woman can die! He shook his head sharply. Such thoughts defied mentat logic. Death was a necessity that life might continue.\nThe ghola loves me, Alia thought.\nThe thought became bedrock to which she might cling. He was a familiar face with a solid room behind him. She recognized one of the bedrooms in Paul’s suite.\nA fixed, immutable person did something with a tube in her throat. She fought against retching.\n“We got her in time,” a voice said, and she recognized the tones of a Family medic. “You should’ve called me sooner.” There was suspicion in the medic’s voice. She felt the tube Slide out of her throat—a snake, a shimmering cord.\n“The slapshot will make her sleep,” the medic said. “I'll send one of her attendants to—”\n“I will stay with her,” the ghola said.\n“That is not seemly!” the medic snapped.\n“Stay ... Duncan,” Alia whispered.\nHe stroked her hand to tell her he’d heard.\n“M’Lady,” the medic said, “it'd be better if...”\n“You do not tell me what is best,” she rasped. Her throat ached with each syllable.\n“M’Lady,” the medic said, voice accusing, “you know the dangers of consuming too much melange. | can only assume someone gave it to you without—”\n“You are a fool,” she rasped. “Would you deny me my visions? | knew what I took and why.” She put a hand to her throat. “Leave us. At once!”\nThe medic pulled out of her field of vision, said: “I will send word to your brother.”\nShe felt him leave, turned her attention to the", "I'll send one of her attendants to—”\n“I will stay with her,” the ghola said.\n“That is not seemly!” the medic snapped.\n“Stay ... Duncan,” Alia whispered.\nHe stroked her hand to tell her he’d heard.\n“M’Lady,” the medic said, “it'd be better if...”\n“You do not tell me what is best,” she rasped. Her throat ached with each syllable.\n“M’Lady,” the medic said, voice accusing, “you know the dangers of consuming too much melange. | can only assume someone gave it to you without—”\n“You are a fool,” she rasped. “Would you deny me my visions? | knew what I took and why.” She put a hand to her throat. “Leave us. At once!”\nThe medic pulled out of her field of vision, said: “I will send word to your brother.”\nShe felt him leave, turned her attention to the ghola. The vision lay clearly in her awareness now, a culture medium in which the present grew outward. She sensed the ghola move in that play of Time, no longer cryptic, fixed now against a recognizable background.\nHe is the crucible, she thought. He is danger and salvation.\nAnd she shuddered, knowing she saw the vision her brother had seen. Unwanted tears burned her eyes. She shook her head sharply. No tears! They wasted moisture and, worse, distracted the harsh flow of vision. Paul must be stopped! Once, just once, she had bridged Time to place her voice where he would pass. But stress and mutability would not permit that here. The web of Time passed through her brother now like rays of light through a lens. He stood at the focus and he knew it. He had gathered all the lines to himself and would not permit them to escape or change.\n“Why?” she muttered. “Is it hate? Does he strike out at Time itself because it hurt him? Is that it... hate?”\nThinking he heard her speak his name, the ghola said: “M’Lady?”\n“If | could only burn this thing out of me!” she cried. “| didn’t want to be different.”\n“Please, Alia,” he murmured. “Let yourself sleep.”\n“I wanted to be able to laugh,” she whispered. Tears slid down her cheeks. “But I’m sister to an Emperor who’s worshipped as a god. People fear me. | never wanted to be feared.”\nHe wiped the tears from her face.\n“| don’t want to be part of history,” she whispered. “I just want to be loved .. . and to love.”\n“You are loved,” he said.\n“Ahhh, loyal, loyal Duncan,” she said.\n“Please, don’t call me that,” he pleaded.\n“But you are,” she said. “And loyalty is a valued commodity. It can be sold... not bought, but sold.”\n“| don’t like your cynicism,” he said.\n“Damn your logic! It’s true!”\n“Sleep,” he said.\n“Do you love me, Duncan?” she asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Is that one of those lies,” she asked, “one of the lies that are easier to believe than the truth? Why am | afraid to believe you?”\n“You fear my differences as you fear your own.”\n“Be a man, not a mentat!” she snarled.\n“Lam a mentat and a man.”\n“Will you make me your woman, then?”\n“I will do what love demands.”\n“And loyalty?”\n“And loyalty.”\n“That’s where you're dangerous,” she said.\nHer words disturbed him. No sign of the disturbance arose to his face, no muscle trembled—but she knew it. Vision- memory exposed the disturbance. She felt she had missed part of the vision, though, that she should remember something else from the future. There existed another perception which did not go precisely by the senses, a thing which fell into her head from nowhere the way prescience did. It lay in the Time shadows—infinitely painful.\nEmotion! That was it—emotion! It had appeared in the vision, not directly, but as a product from which she could infer what lay behind. She had been possessed by emotion —a single constriction made up of fear, grief and love. They lay there in the vision, all collected into a single epidemic body, overpowering and primordial.\n“Duncan, don’t let me go,” she whispered.\n“Sleep,” he said. “Don’t fight it.”\n“I must... I must. He’s the bait in his own trap. He’s the servant of power and terror. Violence . . . deification is a prison enclosing him. He'll lose... everything. It'll tear him apart.”\n“You speak of Paul?”\n“They drive him to destroy himself,” she gasped, arching her back. “Too much weight, too much grief. They seduce him away from love.” She sank back to the bed. “They’re creating a universe where he won't permit himself to live.”\n“Who is doing this?”\n“He is! Ohhh, you’re so dense. He’s part of the pattern. And it’s too late... too late . . . too late ...”\nAs she spoke, she felt her awareness descend, layer by layer. It came to rest directly behind her navel. Body and mind separated and merged in a storehouse of relic visions —moving, moving ... She heard a fetal heartbeat, a child of the future. The melange still possessed her, then, setting her adrift in Time. She knew she had tasted the life of a child not yet conceived. One thing certain about this child— it would suffer the same awakening she had suffered. It would be an aware, thinking entity before birth.\nThere exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.\n—MUAD’DIB ON LAW FROM THE STILGAR COMMENTARY\nhani stared out at the morning desert framed in the fault\ncleft below Sietch Tabr. She wore no stillsuit, and this made her feel unprotected here in the desert. The sietch grotto’s entrance lay hidden in the buttressed cliff above and behind her.\nThe desert... the desert... She felt that the desert had followed her wherever she had gone. Coming back to the desert was not so much a homecoming as a turning around to see what had always been there.\nA painful constriction surged through her abdomen. The birth would be soon. She fought down the pain, wanting this moment alone with her desert.\nDawn stillness gripped the land. Shadows fled among the dunes and terraces of the Shield Wall all around. Daylight lunged over the high scarp and plunged her up to her eyes in a bleak landscape stretching beneath a washed blue sky. The scene matched the feeling of dreadful cynicism which had tormented her since the moment she’d learned of Paul’s blindness.\nWhy are we here? she wondered.\nIt was not a hajra, a journey of seeking. Paul sought nothing here except, perhaps, a place for her to give birth. He had summoned odd companions for this journey, she thought—Bijaz, the Tleilaxu dwarf; the ghola, Hayt, who might be Duncan Idaho’s revenant; Edric, the Guild\nSteersman-Ambassador; Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother he so obviously hated; Lichna, Otheym’s strange daughter, who seemed unable to move beyond the watchful eyes of guards; Stilgar, her uncle of the Naibs, and his favorite wife, Harah ... and Irulan... Alia...\nThe sound of wind through the rocks accompanied her thoughts. The desert day had become yellow on yellow, tan on tan, gray on gray.\nWhy such a strange mixture of companions?\n“We have forgotten,” Paul had said in response to her question, “that the word ‘company’ originally meant traveling companions. We are a company.”\n“But what value are they?”\n“There!” he’d said, turning his frightful sockets toward her. “We've lost that clear, single-note of living. If it cannot be bottled, beaten, pointed or hoarded, we give it no value.\nHurt, she’d said: “That’s not what | meant.”\n“Ahhh, dearest one,” he’d said, soothing, “we are so money-rich and so life-poor. | am evil, obstinate, stupid...”\n“You are not!”\n“That, too, is true. But my hands are blue with time. | think... I think I tried to invent life, not realizing it'd already been invented.”\nAnd he’d touched her abdomen to feel the new life there.\nRemembering, she placed both hands over her abdomen and trembled, sorry that she’d asked Paul to bring her here.\nThe desert wind had stirred up evil odors from the fringe plantings which anchored the dunes at the cliff base. Fremen superstition gripped her: evil odors, evil times. She faced into the wind, saw a worm appear outside the plantings. It arose like the prow of a demon ship out of the dunes, threshed sand, smelled the water deadly to its kind, and fled beneath a long, burrowing mound.\nShe hated the water then, inspired by the worm’s fear. Water, once the spirit-soul of Arrakis, had become a poison.\n”\nWater brought pestilence. Only the desert was clean.\nBelow her, a Fremen work gang appeared. They climbed to the sietch’s middle entrance, and she saw that they had muddy feet.\nFremen with muddy feet!\nThe children of the sietch began singing to the morning above her, their voices piping from the upper entrance. The voices made her feel time fleeing from her like hawks before the wind. She shuddered.\nWhat storms did Paul see with his eyeless vision?\nShe sensed a vicious madman in him, someone weary of songs and polemics.\nThe sky, she noted, had become crystal gray filled with alabaster rays, bizarre designs etched across the heavens by windborne sand. A line of gleaming white in the south caught her attention. Eyes suddenly alerted, she interpreted the sign: White sky in the south: Shai-hulud’s mouth. A storm came, big wind. She felt the warning breeze, a crystal blowing of sand against her cheeks. The incense of death came on the wind: odors of water flowing in qanats, sweating sand, flint. The water—that was why Shai-hulud sent his coriolis wind.\nHawks appeared in the cleft where she stood, seeking safety from the wind. They were brown as the rocks and with scarlet in their wings. She felt her spirit go out to them: they had a place to hide; she had none.\n“M’Lady, the wind comes!”\nShe turned, saw the ghola calling to her outside the upper entrance to the sietch. Fremen fears gripped her. Clean death and the body’s water claimed for the tribe, these she understood. But... something brought back from death...\nWindblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the storm had taken ona tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She\nhesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert’s transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs.\nThe storm out there had become a universal thing"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_ef79cb2d0c0c781e8d51c8a056b992b47e3032dcdd0754d26ce28d524010634f_v2"}
