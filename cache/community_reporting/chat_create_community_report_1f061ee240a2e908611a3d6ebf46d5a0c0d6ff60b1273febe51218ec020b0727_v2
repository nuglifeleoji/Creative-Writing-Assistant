This mass migration was driven by a combination of factors, including fear of stagnation, the pursuit of new opportunities, and the dissemination of the Tyrant’s teachings, which evolved in unpredictable ways yet retained a submissive undercurrent to recognition. The event is frequently referenced in historical records, such as those discovered in the Ixian storehouse, and is noted in Teg’s reflections on Gammu’s overgrowth, underscoring its far-reaching impact.  \n\nDuring The Scattering, humanity fragmented into numerous factions, some of which developed new religions, political systems, and technologies. This dispersal gave rise to emergent powers and unforeseen threats, reshaping the galactic landscape. Among the notable consequences was the flight of the Bashar, who stole a no-ship and fled into the distant and enigmatic reaches of The Scattering, highlighting the region’s mysterious and untamed nature.  \n\nWhile interpretations of The Scattering vary, it is universally acknowledged as a transformative epoch that propelled humanity beyond its known boundaries, fostering both innovation and instability.
