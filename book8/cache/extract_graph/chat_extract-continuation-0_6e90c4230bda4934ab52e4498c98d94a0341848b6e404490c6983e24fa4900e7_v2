“轩宇。”钱磊惊讶的看向他，心中暗想，这位不会是要惹事儿去吧？这才第一天上学，已经两次了啊！合着他是吃饱了。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“没事儿，我找同学帮个忙。”\n\n    食堂不大，几步他就来到叶灵瞳身边，感受到他的到来，叶灵瞳的两位队友都抬起头来，叶灵瞳自己也是一愣，扭头看到是蓝轩宇，不禁有些疑惑。\n\n    “叶灵瞳，我想跟你单独说句话。”蓝轩宇道。\n\n    此言一出，周围都有些安静，坐在叶灵瞳对面的吕千寻皱了皱眉，“有话就说吧。”\n\n    蓝轩宇看了他一眼，道：“我想跟叶灵瞳说。这事儿有点秘密，属于我们俩的。”\n\n    “咦……”周围的学员们顿时发出一些惊讶的声音，还有笑出声的，不知道是谁，还吹了声口哨。\n\n    “单独的私人秘密啊！”金翔嘿嘿一笑，在旁边站了起来，“班长，我可不是挑事儿的人啊！蓝轩宇这是要挖你们组墙角啊！我不知道你什么脾气，反正要是我，我可忍不了。”\n\n    “金翔，你起什么哄？”叶灵瞳猛然站起身，瞪了金翔一眼，然后一拉蓝轩宇就向外走去。\n\n    吕千寻愣了愣，叶灵瞳和蓝轩宇就已经走出食堂了。\n\n    放下手中餐具，这位班长的脸色顿时变得有些难看起来。\n\n
