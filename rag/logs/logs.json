He heard truth in the old woman’s voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there...if this were truly a test.... And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it, trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite.\n“I must not fear. Fear is the mina-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner\neye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\nHe felt calmness return, said: “Get on with it, old woman.”\n“Old woman!” she snapped. “You’ve courage, and that can’t be denied. Well, we shall see, sirra.” She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a whisper. “You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand and l'Il touch your neck with my gom jabbar—the death so swift it’s like the fall of the headsman’s axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you. Understand?”\n“What’s in the box?”\n“Pain.”\nHe felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. How could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.\nThe old woman said: “You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.”\nThe itch became the faintest burning. “Why are you doing this?” he demanded.\n“To determine if you’re human. Be silent.”\nPaul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat...upon heat. He felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the fingers of the burning hand, but couldn’t move them.\n“It burns,” he whispered.\n“Silence!”\nPain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber cried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit...but...the gom jabbar. Without turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow his breaths and couldn't.\nPain!\nHis world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the ancient face inches away Staring at him.\nHis lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them.\nThe burning! The burning!\nHe thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.\nIt stopped!\nAs though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.\nPaul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.\n“Enough,” the old woman muttered. “Kull wahad! No woman-child ever withstood that much. | must’ve wanted you to fail.” She leaned back, withdrawing the gom jabbar from the side of his neck. “Take your hand from the box, young human, and look at it.”\nHe fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his hand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every\nmovement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box.\n“Do it!” she snapped.\nHe jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.\n“Pain by nerve induction,” she said. “Can't go around maiming potential humans. There’re those who'd give a pretty for the secret of this box, though.” She slipped it into the folds of her gown.\n“But the pain—” he said.\n“Pain,” she sniffed. “A human can override any nerve in the body.”\nPaul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to his side, looked at the old woman. “You did that to my mother once?”\n“Ever sift sand through a screen?” she asked.\nThe tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: Sand through a screen. He nodded.\n“We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.”\nHe lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. “And that’s all there is to it—pain?”\n“I observed you in pain, lad. Pain’s merely the axis of the test. Your mother’s told you about our ways of observing. | see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.”\nHe heard the confirmation in her voice, said: “It’s truth!”\nShe stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: “Hope clouds observation.”\n“You know when people believe what they say,” she said.\n“I know it.”\nThe harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She heard them, said: “Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet.”\n“I prefer to stand.”\n“Your mother sat at my feet once.”\n“l'm not my mother.”\n“You hate us a little, eh?” She looked toward the door, called out: “Jessica!”\nThe door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room. Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.\n“Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?” the old woman asked.\n“I both love and hate you,” Jessica said. “The hate —that’s from pains | must never forget. The love— that’s....”\n“Just the basic fact,” the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. “You may come in now, but remain Silent. Close that door and mind it that no one interrupts us.”\nJessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to it. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and ts...human. | knew he was...but...he lives. Now, | can go on living. The door felt hard and\nreal against her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses.\nMy son lives.\nPaul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke truth. His mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it...the pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.\n“Someday, lad,” the old woman said, “you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a measure of doing.”\nPaul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the Reverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater.\n“Why do you test for humans?” he asked.\n“To set you free.”\n“Free?”\n“Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”\n““Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind,’” Paul quoted.\n“Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,” she said. “But what the O.C. Bible Should've said is: ‘Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.’ Have you studied the Mentat in your service?”\n“lve studied with Thufir Hawat.”\n“The Great Revolt took away a crutch,” she said. “It forced human minds to develop. Schools were started to train human talents.”\n“Bene Gesserit schools?”\nShe nodded. “We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.”\n“Politics,” he said.\n“Kull wahad!” the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.\n“I’ve not told him, Your Reverence,” Jessica said.\nThe Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. “You did that on remarkably few clues,” she said. “Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock—for breeding purposes.”\nThe old woman’s words abruptly lost their special Sharpness for Paul. He felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It wasn’t\nthat Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said. It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.\nHe said: “But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don’t know their ancestry.”\n“The genetic lines are always in our records,” she said. “Your mother knows that either she’s of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in itself.”\n“Then why couldn’t she know who her parents are?”\n“Some do.... Many don’t. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many reasons.”\nAgain, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: “You take a lot on yourselves.”\nThe Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did | hear criticism in his voice? “We carry a heavy burden,” she said.\nPaul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He leveled a measuring stare at her, said: “You say maybe I’m the...Kwisatz Haderach. What’s that, a human gom jabbar?”\n“Paul,” Jessica said. “You mustn’t take that tone with—”\n“FIL handle this, Jessica,” the old woman said. “Now, lad, do you know about the Truthsayer drug?”\n“You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,” he said. “My mother’s told me.”\n“Have you ever seen truthtrance?”\nHe shook his head. “No.”\n“The drug’s dangerous,” she said, “but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer’s gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory—in her body’s memory. We look down so many avenues of the past...but only feminine avenues.” Her voice took on a note of sadness. “Yet, there’s a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is Said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot—into both feminine and masculine pasts.”\n“Your Kwisatz Haderach?”\n“Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men have tried the drug...so many, but none has succeeded.”\n######################\nOutput:",

This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad’Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad’Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| n the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.\nIt was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.\nThe old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul’s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.\nBy the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step\nahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch Shadow—hatr like matted spiderwebs, hooded ‘round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.\n“Is he not small for his age, Jessica?” the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.\nPaul’s mother answered in her soft contralto: “The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.”\n“So I’ve heard, so I’ve heard,” wheezed the old woman. “Yet he’s already fifteen.”\n“Yes, Your Reverence.”\n“He’s awake and listening to us,” said the old woman. “Sly little rascal.” She chuckled. “But royalty has need of slyness. And if he’s really the Kwisatz Haderach...well....”\nWithin the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they Stared into his.\n“Sleep well, you sly little rascal,” said the old woman. “Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.”\nAnd she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump.\nPaul lay awake wondering: What’s a gom jabbar?\nIn all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen.\nYour Reverence.\nAnd the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a\nBene Gesserit Lady, a duke’s concubine and mother of the ducal heir.\nls a gom jabbar something of Arrakis | must know before we go there? he wondered.\nHe mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar... Kwisatz Haderach.\nThere had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul’s mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune —Desert Planet.\nThufir Hawat, his father’s Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-flef under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\n“A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,” Hawat had said.\nArrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.\nPaul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip- drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions.\nThe dream faded.\n######################\nOutput:",

Have you observed our good Mentat? You should’ve learned something from this exchange.”\n“But, Uncle—”\n“A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”\n“Yes, but—”\n“Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might’ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he’s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, Piter, but he still can err.”\nPiter spoke in a low, sullen tone: “Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism, Baron?”\n“Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. | wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.”\n“Are you already training my replacement?” Piter demanded.\n“Replace you? Why, Piter, where could | find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?”\n“The same place you found me, Baron.”\n“Perhaps | should at that,” the Baron mused. “You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!”\n“Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?”\n“My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could | object to that? | merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.”\n“Then I’m on display,” Piter said. “Shall | dance? Shall | perform my various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau—”\n“Precisely,” the Baron said. “You are on display. Now, be silent.” He glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew’s lips, the full and pouting look of them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. “This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties. The fact that it’s encased in a human body, however, must not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. | sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea.”\n“They were toys compared to me,” Piter snarled. “You yourself, Baron, could outperform those machines.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron said. “Ah, well....” He took a deep breath, belched. “Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.”\n“Baron, I’ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My observations of—”\n“I'll be the judge of this,” the Baron said. “I give you an order, Mentat. Perform one of your various\nfunctions.”\n“So be it,” Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity—as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. “In a few days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a Spacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of Arrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke’s Mentat, Thufir Hawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.”\n“Listen carefully, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Observe the plans within plans within plans.”\nFeyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his heir.\n“There are several tangential possibilities,” Piter said. “I indicate that House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium.”\n“The Duke’s too proud a man for that,” the Baron said.\n“It is a possibility,” Piter said. “The ultimate effect for us would be the same, however.”\n“No, it would not!” the Baron growled. “I must have him dead and his line ended.”\n“That’s the high probability,” Piter said. “There are certain preparations that indicate when a House is\ngoing renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none of these things.”\n“So,” the Baron sighed. “Get on with it, Piter.”\n“At Arrakeen,” Piter said, “the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.”\n“The Ambassador to the Smugglers,” the Baron chuckled.\n“Ambassador to what?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\n“Your uncle makes a joke,” Piter said. “He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor’s interest in smuggling operations on Arrakis.”\nFeyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. “Why?”\n“Don’t be dense, Feyd,” the Baron snapped. “As long as the Guild remains effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could spies and assassins move about?”\nFeyd-Rautha’s mouth made a soundless “Oh-h-h- h.”\n“We've arranged diversions at the Residency,” Piter said. “There’ll be an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir—an attempt which could succeed.”\n“Piter,” the Baron rumbled, “you indicated—”\n“I indicated accidents can happen,” Piter said. “And the attempt must appear valid.”\n“Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,” the Baron said. “Of course, he’s potentially more dangerous than the father...with that witch mother training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.”\n“Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,” Piter said. “The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial Conditioning— Supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It’s assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as Someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.”\n“How?” Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew you couldn’t subvert Imperial Conditioning!\n“Another time,” the Baron said. “Continue, Piter.\n“In place of Yueh,” Piter said, “we’ll drag a most interesting suspect across Hawat’s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to Hawat’s attention.”\n“Her?” Feyd-Rautha asked.\n“The Lady Jessica herself,” the Baron said.\n“Is it not sublime?” Piter asked. “Hawat’s mind will be so filled with this prospect it'll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.” Piter frowned, then: “But | don’t think he'll be able to carry it off.”\n“You don’t want him to, eh?” the Baron asked.\n“Don’t distract me,” Piter said. “While Hawat’s occupied with the Lady Jessica, we'll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe\n”\nhe’s gaining a measure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we'll signal Yueh and move in with our major force...ah....”\n“Go ahead, tell him all of it,” the Baron said.\n“We'll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in Harkonnen livery.”\n“Sardaukar!” Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.\n“You see how | trust you, Feyd,” the Baron said. “No hint of this must ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial House and there’d be chaos.”\n“The main point,” Piter said, “is this: since House Harkonnen is being used to do the Imperial dirty work, we've gained a true advantage. It’s a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.”\n“You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we'll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company.”\nFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company’s coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships—they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of\nvoting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.\n“The Duke Leto,” Piter said, “may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert’s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty’s agents—the planetary ecologist. You may remember him—Kynes.”\n“Feyd remembers him,” the Baron said. “Get on with it.”\n“You do not drool very prettily, Baron,” Piter said.\n“Get on with it, | command you!” the Baron roared.\nPiter shrugged. “If matters go as planned,” he said, “House Harkonnen will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.”\n“More profits,” Feyd-Rautha said.\n“Indeed,” the Baron said. And he thought: /t’s only Just. We’re the ones who tamed Arrakis...except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert...and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool.\n“And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,” Piter said. “They will know.”\n“They will know,” the Baron breathed.\n“Loveliest of all,” Piter said, “is that the Duke will know, too. He knows now. He can already feel the trap.”\n“It’s true the Duke knows,” the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. “He could not help but know...more’s the pity.”\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. AS he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension—grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.\n“lam hungry,” the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. “Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.”\nThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: “The Reverend Mother must combine\n######################\nOutput:",

It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| t was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, Spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.\nAn ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the center of the room. Veriform Suspensor Chairs ringed it, two of them occupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with sullen eyes. The other held a Slender, short man with effeminate face.\nBoth youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows spinning it.\nA chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle: “There it is, Piter—the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke’s headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?”\n“Assuredly, Baron,” said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet, musical quality.\nThe fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest cloudmilk diamonds.\nThe fat hand moved, tracing details on the Surface. “I invite you to observe,” the basso voice rumbled. “Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd- Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south—these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps—so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique victory.”\nA smile touched Piter’s lips. “And to think, Baron: the Padishah Emperor believes he’s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.”\n“That’s a nonsensical statement,” the Baron rumbled. “You say this to confuse young Feyd- Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.”\nThe sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black leotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him.\nPiter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.\n“Well?” the Baron demanded.\n“The fool answered us, Baron!”\n“Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?” the Baron asked. “Well, what does he say?”\n“He’s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as ‘Harkonnen’—no ‘Sire et Cher Cousin,’ no title, nothing.”\n“It’s a good name,” the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his impatience. “What does dear Leto say?”\n“He says: ‘Your offer of a meeting is refused. | have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know.’”\n“And?” the Baron asked.\n“He says: ‘The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.’ He signs it: ‘Duke Leto of Arrakis.’” Piter began to laugh. “Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is almost too rich!”\n“Be silent, Piter,” the Baron said, and the laughter Stopped as though shut off with a switch. “Kanly, is it?” the Baron asked. “Vendetta, heh? And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure | know he means it.”\n“You made the peace gesture,” Piter said. “The forms have been obeyed.”\n“For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,” the Baron said. And he thought: / must do away with that one\nsoon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The Baron stared across the room at his Mentat assassin, seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.\nA grin flashed across Piter’s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like holes. “But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for Dune—and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!”\nIn a cold voice, the Baron said: “You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.”\n“But | am happy, my Baron. Whereas you...you are touched by jealousy.”\n“Piter!”\n“Ah-ah, Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself?”\n“Someday | will have you strangled, Piter.”\n“Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?”\n“Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?”\n“Truth without fear surprises the Baron,” Piter said. His face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask. “Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, | Know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as | am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I’m yet of much use. | know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet— waste not. True, Baron?”\nThe Baron continued to stare at Piter.\nFeyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My uncle cannot talk to his Mentat without arguing. Do they think I’ve nothing to do except listen to their arguments?\n“Feyd,” the Baron said. “I told you to listen and learn when | invited you in here. Are you learning?”\n“Yes, Uncle.” The voice was carefully subservient.\n“Sometimes | wonder about Piter,” the Baron said. “I cause pain out of necessity, but he...l swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, | can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon, and that'll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor...and knowing that will be a terrible thing.”\n“Then why haven’t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs quietly and efficiently?” Piter asked. “You talk of pity, but—”\n“The Duke must know when I encompass his doom,” the Baron said. “And the other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. l'Il gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but | don’t have to like it.”\n“Room to maneuver,” Piter sneered. “Already you have the Emperor’s eyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that’ll be an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.”\n“You'd like to see that, wouldn’t you, Piter?” the Baron asked. “You’d enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle. You’d truly enjoy that.”\n“Does the Baron need to ask?” Piter whispered.\n“You should’ve been a Bashar of the Corps,” the Baron said. “You're too interested in blood and pain. Perhaps | was too quick with my promise of the spoils of Arrakis.”\nPiter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.\n“Do not toy with Piter, Baron,” Piter said. “You promised me the Lady Jessica. You promised her to me.”\n“For what, Piter?” the Baron asked. “For pain?”\nPiter stared at him, dragging out the silence.\nFeyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one Side, said: “Uncle, do | have to stay? You said you’d\n“My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,” the Baron said. He moved within the shadows beside the globe. “Patience, Feyd.” And he turned his attention back to the Mentat. “What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?”\n“The trap will bring him to you, Baron,” Piter muttered.\n“That’s not my question,” the Baron said. “You'll recall that you predicted the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh, Mentat?”\n“I’m not often wrong, Baron,” Piter said, and for the first time there was fear in his voice. “Give me that: I’m not often wrong. And you know yourself\nthese Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor’s consort had produced only females.”\n“Uncle,” said Feyd-Rautha, “you said there’d be something important here for me to—”\n“Listen to my nephew,” the Baron said. “He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he cannot rule himself.” The Baron stirred beside the globe, a Shadow among shadows. “Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, | summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should’ve learned something from this exchange.”\n“But, Uncle—”\n“A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”\n“Yes, but—”\n“Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might’ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he’s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, P\n######################\nOutput:",

He can already feel the trap.”\n“It’s true the Duke knows,” the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. “He could not help but know...more’s the pity.”\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. AS he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension—grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.\n“lam hungry,” the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. “Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.”\nThus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: “The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place- between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.”\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad W ell, Jessica, what have you to say for yourself?” asked the Reverend Mother.\nIt was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul’s ordeal. The two women were alone in Jessica’s morning room while Paul waited in the adjoining soundproofed Meditation Chamber.\nJessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the evening’s banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not hear the Reverend Mother’s question.\nThere had been another ordeal once—so many years ago. A skinny girl with hair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had entered the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at her right hand, flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the anger.\n“Poor Paul,” she whispered.\n“| asked you a question, Jessica!” The old woman’s voice was snappish, demanding.\n“What? Oh....” Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the Reverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west windows. “What do you want me to say?”\n“What do | want you to say? What do I want you to say?” The old voice carried a tone of cruel mimicry.\n“So I had a son!” Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into this anger deliberately.\n“You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.”\n“It meant so much to him,” Jessica pleaded.\n“And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!”\nJessica lifted her chin. “I sensed the possibility.”\n“You thought only of your Duke’s desire for a son,” the old woman snapped. “And his desires don’t figure in this. An Atreides daughter could’ve been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You’ve hopelessly complicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now.”\n“You're not infallible,” Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the old eyes.\nPresently, the old woman muttered: “What’s done is done.”\n“I vowed never to regret my decision,” Jessica Said.\n“How noble,” the Reverend Mother sneered. “No regrets. We shall see when you're a fugitive with a\nprice on your head and every man’s hand turned against you to seek your life and the life of your son.”\nJessica paled. “Is there no alternative?”\n“Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?”\n“I ask only what you see in the future with your Superior abilities.”\n“I see in the future what I’ve seen in the past. You well know the pattern of our affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of its heredity. It’s in the bloodstream—the urge to mingle genetic strains without plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.”\n“CHOAM,” Jessica muttered. “Il suppose it’s already decided how they'll redivide the spoils of Arrakis.”\n“What is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times,” the old woman said. “The Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent of the CHOAM directorship’s votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely as others smell those same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the pattern of history, girl.”\n“That’s certainly what I need right now,” Jessica said. “A review of history.”\n“Don’t be facetious, girl! You know as well as | do what forces surround us. We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures. It'd be bad enough\nwithout the complication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.”\nJessica spoke bitterly: “Chips in the path of the flood—and this chip here, this is the Duke Leto, and this one’s his son, and this one’s—”\n“Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate edge you walked.”\n“lam Bene Gesserit: | exist only to serve,’” Jessica quoted.\n“Truth,” the old woman said. “And all we can hope for now is to prevent this from erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the key bloodlines.”\nJessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She fought down the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the ragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, “lIl pay for my own mistake.”\n“And your son will pay with you.”\n“I'll shield him as well as I’m able.”\n“Shield!” the old woman snapped. “You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he'll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny.”\nJessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. “Is it really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?”\n“Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there and softened it up somewhat.” The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her feet, straightened a fold in her gown. “Call the boy in here. | must be leaving soon.”\n“Must you?”\nThe old woman’s voice softened. “Jessica, girl, | wish | could stand in your place and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path.”\n“Tl know.”\n“You're as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but | cannot let that interfere with duty.”\n“I understand...the necessity.”\n“What you did, Jessica, and why you did it—we both know. But kindness forces me to tell you there’s little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit Totality. You mustn’t let yourself hope too much.”\nJessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture. “You make me feel like a little girl again—reciting my first lesson.” She forced the words out: “‘Humans must never submit to animals.”’ A dry sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: “I’ve been so lonely.”\n“It should be one of the tests,” the old woman said. “Humans are almost always lonely. Now summon the boy. He’s had a long, frightening day. But he’s had time to think and remember, and | must ask the other questions about these dreams of his.”\nJessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it. “Paul, come in now, please.”\nPaul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though she were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the Reverend Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal. He heard his mother close the door behind him.\nr\n“Young man,” the old woman said, “let’s return to this dream business.”\n“What do you want?”\n“Do you dream every night?”\n“Not dreams worth remembering. | can remember every dream, but some are worth remembering and some aren't.”\n“How do you know the difference?”\n“I just know it.”\nThe old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. “What did you dream last night? Was it worth remembering?”\n“Yes.” Paul closed his eyes. “I dreamed a cavern... and water...and a girl there—very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in them. | talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on Caladan.” Paul opened his eyes.\n“And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen today?”\nPaul thought about this, then: “Yes. | tell the girl you came and put a stamp of strangeness on me.”\n“Stamp of strangeness,” the old woman breathed, and again she shot a glance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. “Tell me truly now, Paul, do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?”\n“Yes. And I’ve dreamed about that girl before.”\n“Oh? You know her?”\n“I will Know her.”\n“Tell me about her.”\nAgain, Paul closed his eyes. “We're in a little place in some rocks where it’s sheltered. It’s almost night,\nbut it’s hot and | can see patches of sand out of an opening in the rocks. We’re...waiting for something... for me to go meet some people. And she’s frightened but trying to hide it from me, and I’m excited. And she says: ‘Tell me about the waters of your homeworld, Usul.’” Paul opened his eyes. “Isn’t that strange? My homeworld’s Caladan. I’ve never even heard of a planet called Usul.”\n“Is there more to this dream?” Jessica prompted.\n“Yes. But maybe she was calling me Usul,” Paul said. “I just thought of that.” Again, he closed his eyes. “She asks me to tell her about the waters. And | take her hand. And | say l'Il tell her a poem. And | tell her the poem, but | have to explain some of the words—like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls.”\n“What poem?” the Reverend Mother asked.\nPaul opened his eyes. “It’s just one of Gurney Halleck’s tone poems for sad times.”\nBehind Paul, Jessica began to recite:\n“| remember salt smoke from a beach fire And shadows under the pines— Solid, clean...fixed—\nSeagulls perched at the tip of land, White upon green...\nAnd a wind comes through the pines To sway the shadows;\nThe seagulls spread their wings,\nLift\nAnd fill the sky with screeches.\nAnd | hear the wind\nBlowing across our beach,\nAnd the surf, And | see that our fire Has scorched the seaweed.”\n“That’s the one,” Paul said.\nThe old woman stared at Paul, then: “Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene Gesserit, | seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of us. Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a mother. Possibility | see,\n######################\nOutput:",

Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a mother. Possibility | see, too, but no more.”\nShe fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her out.\nPresently, she said: “As you will, then. You’ve depths in you; that l'Il grant.”\n“May | go now?” he asked.\n“Don’t you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the Kwisatz Haderach?” Jessica asked.\n“She said those who tried for it died.”\n“But | can help you with a few hints at why they failed,” the Reverend Mother said.\nShe talks of hints, Paul thought. She doesn’t really know anything. And he said: “Hint then.”\n“And be damned to me?” She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old face. “Very well: ‘That which submits rules.’”\nHe felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as tension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all?\n“That’s a hint?” he asked.\n“We're not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning,” the old woman said. “The willow Submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows—a wall against the wind. This is the willow’s purpose.”\nPaul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him, reinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her: fatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.\n“You think | could be this Kwisatz Haderach,” he said. “You talk about me, but you haven’t said one thing about what we can do to help my father. I’ve heard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my father were dead. Well, he isn’t!”\n“If there were a thing to be done for him, we’d have done it,” the old woman growled. “We may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible. But for your father, nothing. When you've learned to accept that as a fact, you’ve learned a rea/ Bene Gesserit lesson.”\nPaul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His mind seethed with resentment.\nThe Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. “You’ve been training him in the Way—I’ve seen the signs of it. 'd have done the same in your shoes and devil take the Rules.”\nJessica nodded.\n“Now, | caution you,” said the old woman, “to ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it,\nbut we both know how much more he needs...and that desperately.” She stepped close to Paul, stared down at him. “Goodbye, young human. | hope you make it. But if you don’t—well, we shall yet succeed.\nOnce more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed between them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing, with not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from her thoughts.\nBut Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother’s face as she turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.\n”\nYou have read that Muad’Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad’Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney’s songs as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and—of course—the Duke Leto, whose qualities as a father have long been overlooked.\n—FROM “A CHILD'S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhufir Hawat slipped into the training room of\nCastle Caladan, closed the door softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm- leathered. His left leg ached where it had been Slashed once in the service of the Old Duke.\nThree generations of them now, he thought.\nHe stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through the skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table.\nHow many times must | tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to a door? Hawat cleared his throat.\nPaul remained bent over his studies.\nA cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat.\nPaul straightened, spoke without turning: “I know. I’m sitting with my back to a door.”\nHawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.\nPaul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table. Hawat’s eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face.\n“I heard you coming down the hall,” Paul said. “And | heard you open the door.”\n“The sounds | make could be imitated.”\n“I'd know the difference.”\nHe might at that, Hawat thought. That witch mother of his is giving him the deep training, certainly. | wonder what her precious school thinks of that? Maybe that’s why they sent the old Proctor here —to whip our dear Lady Jessica into line.\nHawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.\nThere stand I, Hawat thought.\n“Thufir, what’re you thinking?” Paul asked.\nHawat looked at the boy. “I was thinking we'll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.”\n“Does that make you sad?”\n“Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.” He glanced at the charts on the table. “And Arrakis is just another place.”\n“Did my father send you up to test me?”\nHawat scowled—the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded. “You're thinking it’d have been nicer if he’d come up himself, but you must know how busy he is. He'll be along later.”\n“I’ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.”\n“The storms. | see.”\n“They sound pretty bad.”\n“That’s too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push —coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose that’s in their way—sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to Slivers.”\n“Why don’t they have weather control?”\n“Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there’d be maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your father’s House isn’t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.”\n“Have you ever seen the Fremen?”\nThe lad’s mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.\n“Like as not | have seen them,” he said. “There’s little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And they Stink to heaven in any closed space. It’s from those Suits they wear—call them ‘stillsuits’—that reclaim the body’s own water.”\nPaul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. “Water’s precious there,” he said.\nHawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I’m doing it, getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy. It’s madness to go in there without that caution in our minds.\nPaul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. “Water,” he said.\n“You'll learn a great concern for water,” Hawat said. “As the Duke’s son you'll never want for it, but you'll see the pressures of thirst all around you.”\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water starvation.\n“You'll learn about the funeral plains,” she’d said, “about the wilderness that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the Sandworms. You'll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind\nand hidden from view. You'll ride upon your own two feet without ’thopter or groundcar or mount.”\nAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone— singsong and wavering—than by her words.\n“When you live upon Arrakis,” she had said, “khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.”\nPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: “Do you see no hope, Your Reverence?”\n“Not for the father.” And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. “Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things....” She held up four big-knuckled fingers. “the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing....” She closed her fingers into a fist. “...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!”\nA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat’s puzzled frown.\n“Where were you\n######################\nOutput:",

But all of these are as nothing....” She closed her fingers into a fist. “...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!”\nA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat’s puzzled frown.\n“Where were you woolgathering that time?” Hawat asked.\n“Did you meet the Reverend Mother?”\n“That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?” Hawat’s eyes quickened with interest. “I met her.”\n“She....” Paul hesitated, found that he couldn’t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.\n“Yes? What did she?”\nPaul took two deep breaths. “She said a thing.” He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman ’s tone: “‘You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It’s something none of your ancestors learned.’” Paul opened his eyes, said: “That made me angry and | said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, ‘He’s losing it.’ And | said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said, ‘He’ll lose that one, too.’ And | wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he’d already been warned—by you, by Mother, by many people.”\n“True enough,” Hawat muttered.\n“Then why’re we going?” Paul demanded.\n“Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there’s hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?”\nPaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he thought. How?\n“She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,” Paul said. “And | said that one commands. And she said | had some unlearning to do.”\nShe hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.\n“She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.”\n“How'd she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?” Hawat asked.\nPaul shrugged. “Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world’s language, that it’s different for every world. And | thought she meant they didn’t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn’t it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don’t hear just with your ears. And | said that’s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.”\nHawat chuckled. “How’d that sit with her?”\n“I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So | quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: ‘A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.” That seemed to satisfy her.”\nHe seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?\n“Thufir,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as bad as she said?”\n“Nothing could be that bad,” Hawat said and forced a smile. “Take those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, | can tell you there're many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and....” Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. “...they hate Harkonnens with a\nbloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. | tell you only as your father’s helper.”\n“My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,” Paul said. “Do you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis...perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.”\n“We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,” Hawat said. “Only what it was like long ago... mostly. But what is known—you’re right on that score.”\n“Will the Fremen help us?”\n“It’s a possibility.” Hawat stood up. “I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who’s fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It’s not that | think there’s any danger in the castle; it’s just a habit | want you to form.”\nPaul got to his feet, moved around the table. “You're going today?”\n“Today it is, and you'll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it’ll be on the soil of your new world.” He gripped Paul’s right arm at the bicep. “Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.” He released the arm, patted Paul’s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\n“Thufir!” Paul called.\nHawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\n“Don’t sit with your back to any doors,” Paul said.\nA grin spread across the seamed old face. “That | won't, lad. Depend on it.” And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.\nPaul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day here, he\nthought. He looked around the room. We're leaving. The idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things—the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns—the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense of the now. And he wondered: What is the now?\nThe door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons.\n“Well, Gurney Halleck,” Paul called, “are you the new weapons master?”\nHalleck kicked the door shut with one heel. “You'd rather | came to play games, | know,” he said. He glanced around the room, noting that Hawat’s men already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke’s heir. The subtle code signs were all around.\nPaul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung over Gurney’s shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard.\nHalleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up—the rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across the room.\n“So you don’t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,” Halleck said. “And what barb did you\nsink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemy’s funeral.”\nPaul grinned. Of all his father’s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew the man’s moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword.\nHalleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. “If y’ won’t talk, y’ won't,” he said.\nPaul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: “Well, Gurney, do we come prepared for music when it’s fighting time?”\n“So it’s sass for our elders today,” Halleck said. He tried a chord on the instrument, nodded.\n“Where’s Duncan Idaho?” Paul asked. “Isn’t he Supposed to be teaching me weaponry?”\n“Duncan’s gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,” Halleck said. “All you have left is poor Gurney who’s fresh out of fight and spoiling for music.” He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. “And it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we’d best teach you the music trade so’s you won’t waste your life entire.”\n“Maybe you'd better sing me a lay then,” Paul said. “I want to be sure how not to do it.”\n“Ah-h-h, hah!” Gurney laughed, and he swung into “Galacian Girls,” his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:\n“Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls Will do it for pearls,\nAnd the Arrakeen for water! But if you desire dames\nLike consuming flames, Try a Caladanin daughter!”\n“Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick,” Paul said, “but if my mother heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she’d have your ears on the outer wall for decoration.”\nGurney pulled at his left ear. “Poor decoration, too, they having been bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad | know practiced some Strange ditties on his baliset.”\n“So you've forgotten what it’s like to find sand in your bed,” Paul said. He pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. “Then, let’s fight!”\nHalleck’s eyes went wide in mock surprise. “So! It was your wicked hand did that deed! Guard yourself today, young master—guard yourself.” He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. “I’m a hellfiend out for revenge!”\nPaul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the agui/e, one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.\n“What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,” Paul intoned. “This doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded.” Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. “In shield fighting, one moves fast on\ndefense, slow on attack,” Paul said. “Attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!” Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a Slow thrust timed to enter a shield’s mindless defenses.\nHalleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest. “Speed, excellent,” he said. “But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.”\nPaul stepped back, chagrined.\n“I should whap your backside for such carelessness,” Halle\n######################\nOutput:",

He lifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. “This in the hand of an enemy can let out your life’s blood! You’re an apt pupil, none better, but I’ve warned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his hand.”\n“I guess I’m not in the mood for it today,” Paul said.\n“Mood?” Halleck’s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield’s filtering. “What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises—no matter the mood! Mood’s a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It’s not for fighting.”\n“I’m sorry, Gurney.”\n“You're not sorry enough!”\nHalleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left hand, the rapier poised high in his right. “Now | say guard yourself for true!” He\nleaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.\nPaul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as Shield edges touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his Skin. What’s gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He’s not faking this! Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath.\n“You see a need for an extra blade, eh?” Halleck grunted.\nIs this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!\nAround the room they fought—thrust and parry, feint and counter-feint. The air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the Slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new shield contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.\nPaul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise table. /f / can turn him beside the table, l'Il show him a trick, Paul thought. One more step, Gurney.\nHalleck took the step.\nPaul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck’s rapier catch against the table’s edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in across Halleck’s neckline with the bodkin. He Stopped the blade an inch from the jugular.\n“Is this what you seek?” Paul whispered.\n“Look down, lad,” Gurney panted.\nPaul obeyed, saw Halleck’s kindjal thrust under the table’s edge, the tip almost touching Paul’s groin.\n“We'd have joined each other in death,” Halleck said. “But l'Il admit you fought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood.” And he grinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.\n“The way you came at me,” Paul said. “Would you really have drawn my blood?”\nHalleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. “If you’d fought one whit beneath your abilities, l’d have scratched you a good one, a scar you’d remember. l'Il not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who happens along.”\nPaul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. “I deserved that, Gurney. But it would’ve angered my father if you’d hurt me. l'Il not have you punished for my failing.”\n“As to that,” Halleck said, “it was my failing, too. And you needn’t worry about a training scar or two. You're lucky you have so few. As to your father—the Duke’d punish me only if | failed to make a first-class fighting man out of you. And I'd have been failing there if | hadn’t explained the fallacy in this mood thing you’ve suddenly developed.”\nPaul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.\n“It’s not exactly play we do here,” Halleck said.\nPaul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness in Halleck’s manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored inkvine scar on the man’s jaw, remembering the\nstory of how it had been put there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even for an instant. It occurred to Paul, then, that the making of Halleck’s scar had been accompanied by pain—a pain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this thought aside; it chilled their world.\n“I guess | did hope for some play today,” Paul said. “Things are so serious around here lately.”\nHalleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes. There was pain in him —like a blister, all that was left of some lost yesterday that Time had pruned off him.\nHow soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon he must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line: “Please list your next of kin.”\nHalleck spoke without turning: “I sensed the play in you, lad, and I'd like nothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.”\nPaul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.\nHalleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He gestured to the practice dummy. “Now, we'll work on your timing. Let me see you catch that thing sinister. l'Il control it from over here where I can have a full view of the action. And | warn you l'Il be trying new counters today. There’s a warning you'd not get from a real enemy.”\nPaul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He crossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away.\n“En garde!” Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack.\nPaul activated his shield, parried and countered.\nHalleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in fly-buzz.\nI’m the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted onto me—all bearing for someone else to pick.\nFor some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in his mind. But she was dead now—in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She had loved pansies...or was it daisies? He couldn’t remember. It bothered him that he couldn’t remember.\nPaul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand entretisser.\nThe clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul’s interweaving hand motions. He’s been practicing and studying on his own. That’s not Duncan style, and it’s certainly nothing I’ve taught him.\nThis thought only added to Halleck’s sadness. /’m infected by mood, he thought. And he began to\nwonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night.\n“If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets,” he murmured.\nIt was his mother’s expression and he always used it when he felt the blackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that was to be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.\nYUEH (yu ‘é), Wellington (weling-tun), Stdrd 10,082- 10,191; medical doctor of the Suk School (grd Stdrd 10,112); md: Wanna Marcus, B. G. (Stdrd 10,092- 10,186?); chiefly noted as betrayer of Duke Leto Atreides. (Cf: Bibliography, Appendix VII Imperial Conditioning and Betrayal, The.)\n—FROM “DICTIONARY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nIthough he heard Dr. Yueh enter the training\nroom, noting the stiff deliberation of the man’s pace, Paul remained stretched out face down on the exercise table where the masseuse had left him. He felt deliciously relaxed after the workout with Gurney Halleck.\n“You do look comfortable,” said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.\nPaul raised his head, saw the man’s stick figure Standing several paces away, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block of a head with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of Imperial Conditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the Suk School’s silver ring at the left shoulder.\n“You'll be happy to hear we haven’t time for regular lessons today,” Yueh said. “Your father will be along presently.”\nPaul sat up.\n“However, l’ve arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several lessons during the crossing to Arrakis.”\n“Oh.”\nPaul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father would be coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor’s command to take over the fief of Arrakis.\nYueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: / must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.\nPaul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. “What’ll | be studying on the way across?”\n“Ah-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have opened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It’s not clear how. | must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive—a Dr. Kynes— and offer my help in the investigation.”\nAnd Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.\n“Will there be something on the Fremen?” Paul asked.\n“The Fremen?” Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.\n“Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,” Paul said.\n“Yes, to be sure,” Yueh said. “There are two general separations of the people—Fremen, they are\none group, and the others are the people of the graben, the sink, and the pan. There’s some intermarriage, I’m told. The women of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives.

The most interesting feature, of course, is their eyes—totally blue, no whites in them.”\n“Mutation?”\n“No; it’s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.”\n“The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.”\n“By all accounts,” Yueh said. “They compose poems to their knives. Their women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous. You'll not be permitted to mingle with them, | daresay.”\nPaul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!\n“And the worms?” Paul asked.\n“What?”\n“ld like to study more about the sandworms.”\n“Ah-h-h, to be sure. I’ve a filmbook on a small specimen, only one hundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been recorded by reliable\nwitnesses, and there’s reason to believe even larger ones exist.”\nPaul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen latitudes spread on the table. “The desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?”\n“And the storms.”\n“But any place can be made habitable.”\n“If it’s economically feasible,” Yueh said. “Arrakis has many costly perils.” He smoothed his drooping mustache. “Your father will be here soon. Before | go, I’ve a gift for you, something | came across in packing.” He put an object on the table between them—black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul’s thumb.\nPaul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought: How cautious he is.\n“It’s a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system.” He picked it up, demonstrated. “The book is held closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the edge—thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens.”\n“It’s so small.”\n“But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge—thus, and so...and the charge moves ahead one page ata time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.” He closed the book, handed it to Paul. “Try it.”\nYueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: / salve my own conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may | say to myself that he has gone where | cannot go.\n“This must’ve been made before filmbooks,” Paul Said.\n“It’s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too valuable for one so young.”\nAnd Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.\n“Well....” Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. “If it’s so valuable....”\n“Indulge an old man’s whim,” Yueh said. “It was given to me when | was very young.” And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. “Open it to four-sixty-seven Kalima—where it says: ‘From water does all life begin.’ There’s a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place.”\nPaul felt the cover, detected two notches, one Shallower than the other. He pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier sliding into place.\n“Read it aloud,” Yueh said.\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, read: “‘Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is there around us that we cannot—’”\n“Stop it!” Yueh barked.\nPaul broke off, stared at him.\nYueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna’s favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him.\n“Is something wrong?” Paul asked.\n“I'm sorry,” Yueh said. “That was...my...dead wife’s favorite passage. It’s not the one | intended you to read. It brings up memories that are...painful.”\n“There are two notches,” Paul said.\nOf course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.\n“You may find the book interesting,” Yueh said. “It has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.”\nPaul looked down at the tiny book in his palm— such a small thing. Yet, it contained a mystery... something had happened while he read from it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose.\n“Your father will be here any minute,” Yueh said. “Put the book away and read it at your leisure.”\nPaul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself. He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him, Paul had feared the man would demand the book’s return.\n“I thank you for the gift, Dr. Yueh,” Paul said, speaking formally. “It will be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not hesitate to ask.”\n“l,..need for nothing,” Yueh said.\nAnd he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this poor lad...though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen beasts! Why did they choose me for their abomination?\nHow do we approach the study of Muad’Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?\n—FROM “MUAD’'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.\nThe Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed only by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded his narrow waist.\nThe Duke said: “Hard at work, Son?”\nHe crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze around the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not showing his fatigue. / must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to Arrakis, he thought. There'll be no rest on Arrakis.\n“Not very hard,” Paul said. “Everything’s so....” He shrugged.\n“Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It’ll be good to get settled in our new home, put all this upset behind.”\nPaul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother’s words: “...for the father, nothing.”\n“Father,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?”\nThe Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind—the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The pattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought:\nThis is my son.\n“It’ll be dangerous,” he admitted.\n“Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,” Paul said. And he wondered: Why don’t I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?\nThe Duke noted his son’s distress, said: “As always, Hawat sees the main chance. But there’s much more. | see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles—the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship...a subtle gain.”\n“CHOAM controls the spice,” Paul said.\n“And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,” the Duke said. “There’s more to CHOAM than melange.”\n“Did the Reverend Mother warn you?” Paul blurted. He clenched his fists, feeling his palms\nSlippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask that question.\n“Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,” the Duke said. “Don’t let a woman’s fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your mother’s. Take this as a sign of her love for us.”\n“Does she know about the Fremen?”\n“Yes, and about much more.”\n“What?”\nAnd the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even dangerous facts are valuable if you've been trained to deal with them. And there’s one place where nothing has been spared for my son—dealing with dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.\n“Few products escape the CHOAM touch,” the Duke said. “Logs, donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur—the most prosaic and the most exotic...even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.”\n“And now we control it?”\n“To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product—the spice.\nImagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production.”\n“Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,” Paul said. “Others would be out in the cold.” The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim\nsatisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how\n######################\nOutput:",

Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.”\n“And now we control it?”\n“To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product—the spice.\nImagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production.”\n“Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,” Paul said. “Others would be out in the cold.” The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim\nsatisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been. He nodded. “The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.”\n“They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.”\n“They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,” the Duke said. “Think of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership—their unofficial sookesman. Think how they’d react if | were responsible for a serious reduction in their income. After all, one’s own profits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can’t let someone pauperize you!” A harsh smile twisted the Duke’s mouth. “They’d look the other way no matter what was done to me.”\n“Even if we were attacked with atomics?” “Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost anything else short of that...\nperhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning.”\n“Then why are we walking into this?”\n“Paul!” The Duke frowned at his son. “Knowing where the trap is—that’s the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale —a feint within a feint within a feint...seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask another\nquestion: Who else is stockpiling? That’s the list of our enemies.”\n“Who?”\n“Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we'd thought friendly. We need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more important: our beloved Padishah Emperor.”\nPaul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. “Couldn’t you convene the Landsraad, expose—”\n“Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul—we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If we put this before the Landsraad it’d only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we’d gain is a little time while risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?”\n“All the Houses might start stockpiling spice.”\n“Our enemies have a head start—too much of a lead to overcome.”\n“The Emperor,” Paul said. “That means the Sardaukar.”\n“Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,” the Duke said. “But the soldier fanatics nonetheless.”\n“How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?”\n“Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?”\n“The Emperor’s prison planet? No.”\n“What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There’s a question you never hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come from?”\n“From the prison planet?”\n“They come from somewhere.”\n“But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from—”\n“That’s what we're led to believe: they're just the Emperor’s levies trained young and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor’s training cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the military forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and their supporting levies on the other. And their Supporting levies, Paul. The Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar.”\n“But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!”\n“Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men, what environmental conditions would you impose on them?”\n“How could you win the loyalty of such men?”\n“There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority, the mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done. It has been done on many worlds in many times.”\nPaul nodded, holding his attention on his father’s face. He felt some revelation impending.\n“Consider Arrakis,” the Duke said. “When you get outside the towns and garrison villages, it’s every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus.”\nPaul’s eyes went wide. “The Fremen!”\n“We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the Sardaukar. It'll require patience to\nexploit them secretly and wealth to equip them properly. But the Fremen are there...and the spice wealth is there. You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.”\n“Don’t the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?”\n“The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even bothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary populations—spend as little as possible to maintain them.”\nThe metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father’s breast glistened as the Duke shifted his position. “You see?”\n“We're negotiating with the Fremen right now,” Paul said.\n“I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,” the Duke said. “A proud and ruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. | think the Fremen will admire him. If we're lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.”\n“Duncan, the moral,” Paul said, “and Gurney the valorous.”\n“You name them well,” the Duke said.\nAnd Paul thought: Gurney’s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a supporter of worlds—”“... the valor of the brave.”\n“Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,” the Duke said.\n“That isn’t what he told me.”\nThe Duke laughed aloud. “I figured Gurney to be Sparse with his praise. He says you have a nicety of\nawareness—in his own words—of the difference between a blade’s edge and its tip.”\n“Gurney says there’s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be done with the edge.”\n“Gurney’s a romantic,” the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly disturbed him, coming from his son. “I’d sooner you never had to kill...but if the need arises, you do it however you can—tip or edge.” He looked up at the skylight, on which the rain was drumming.\nSeeing the direction of his father’s stare, Paul thought of the wet skies out there—a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts—and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. “Are the Guild ships really big?” he asked.\nThe Duke looked at him. “This wi// be your first time off planet,” he said. “Yes, they’re big. We'll be riding a Heighliner because it’s a long trip. A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner—we'll be just a Small part of the ship’s manifest.”\n“And we won't be able to leave our frigates?”\n“That’s part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we’d have nothing to fear from them. The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.”\n“I’m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.”\n“You won’t. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild’s as jealous of its privacy as it\nis of its monopoly. Don’t do anything to endanger our Shipping privileges, Paul.”\n“Do you think they hide because they’ve mutated and don’t look...Auman anymore?”\n“Who knows?” The Duke shrugged. “It’s a mystery we're not likely to solve. We’ve more immediate problems—among them: you.”\n“Me?”\n“Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have Mentat capabilities.”\nPaul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: “A Mentat? Me? But l....”\n“Hawat agrees, Son. It’s true.”\n“But | thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldn’t be told because it might inhibit the early....” He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. “I see,” he said.\n“A day comes,” the Duke said, “when the potential Mentat must learn what’s being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about himself.”\nPaul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother—the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices—all of it clicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind.\n“You'll be the Duke someday, Son,” his father said. “A Mentat Duke would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now...or do you need more time?”\nThere was no hesitation in his answer. “lIl go on with the training.”\n“Formidable indeed,” the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his father’s face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke’s narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he thought.\nBut even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus).

She could hear the cargo handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.\nJessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a Slow turn, looking up and around at shadowed Carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters’ Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the\nschool the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone.\nSome architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood.\nShe thought not.\nThis had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their new megalopolis of Carthag—a cheap and brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.\nAgain there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica sighed.\nAgainst a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke’s father. Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was still clutched in Jessica’s left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull’s head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull’s shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room.\nJessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things first—the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke’s buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself.\nThe head and the picture.\nThey heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these latitudes the sky looked black and cold—so much darker than the warm blue of Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.\nSo far away, Caladan.\n“Here we are!”\nThe voice was Duke Leto’s.\nShe whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall. His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked dusty and rumpled.\n“I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,” he said.\n“It is a cold house,” she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of sharp angles and planes.\nA sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage, driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor’s command.\n“The whole city feels cold,” she said.\n“It’s a dirty, dusty little garrison town,” he agreed. “But we'll change that.” He looked around the hall. “These are public rooms for state occasions. I’ve just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They’re much nicer.” He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.\nAnd again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry —a renegade House, perhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor’s own blood.\nUnder the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile. And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.\nHe remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her.\n“Where's Paul?” he asked.\n“Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.”\n“Probably in the south wing,” he said. “I thought | heard Yueh’s voice, but | couldn’t take time to look.” He glanced down at her, hesitating. “I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.”\nShe caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the key—there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for comforting. “I Saw our banner over the house as we came in,” she said.\nHe glanced at the painting of his father. “Where were you going to hang that?”\n“Somewhere in here.”\n“No.” The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.\n“My Lord,” she said, “if you’d only....”\n“The answer remains no. | indulge you shamefully in most things, not in this. I’ve just come from the dining hall where there are—”\n“My Lord! Please.”\n“The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear,” he said. “They will hang in the dining hall.”\nShe sighed. “Yes, my Lord.”\n“You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. | shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.”\n“Thank you, my Lord.”\n“And don’t go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that | never married you, my dear. Then it’d be your duty to join me at table for every meal.”\nShe held her face immobile, nodded.\n“Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,” he said. “There’s a portable in your\nroom.”\n“You anticipated this...disagreement,” she said.\n“My dear, | think also of your comfort. I’ve engaged servants. They’re locals, but Hawat has cleared them—they’re Fremen all. They'll do until our own people can be released from their other duties.”\n“Can anyone from this place be truly safe?”\n“Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.”\n“Shadout,” Jessica said. “A Fremen title?”\n“I’m told it means ‘well-dipper,’ a meaning with rather important overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan’s report. They’re convinced she wants to serve—specifically that she wants to serve you.”\n“Me?”\n“The Fremen have learned that you’re Bene Gesserit,” he said. “There are legends here about the Bene Gesserit.”\nThe Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.\n“Does this mean Duncan was successful?” she asked. “Will the Fremen be our allies?”\n“There’s nothing definite,” he said. “They wish to observe us for a while, Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period. That’s a more important gain than it might seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It\nwouldn’t have helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.”\n“A Fremen housekeeper,” Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the Shadout Mapes. “She’ll have the all-blue eyes.”\n“Don’t let the appearance of these people deceive you,” he said. “There’s a deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they'll be everything we need.”\n“It’s a dangerous gamble,” she said.\n“Let’s not go into that again,” he said.\nShe forced a smile. “We are committed, no doubt of that.” She went through the quick regimen of calmness—the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then: “When I assign rooms, is there anything special | should reserve for you?”\n“You must teach me someday how you do that,” he said, “the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.”\n“It’s a female thing,” she said.\nHe smiled. “Well, assignment of rooms: make certain | have large office space next to my sleeping quarters. There'll be more paper work here than on Caladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don’t worry about security of the house. Hawat’s men have been over it in depth.”\n“I’m sure they have.”\nHe glanced at his wristwatch. “And you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for Arrakeen local. I’ve assigned a tech to take care of it. He’ll be along presently.” He brushed a strand of her hair\nback from her forehead. “I must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle’s due any minute with my staff reserves.”\n“Couldn’t Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.”\n“The good Thufir is even busier than | am. You know this planet’s infested with Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, | must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change of fief—and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He’s allowing the opt. About eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there’s a Guild cargo ship standing by.”\n“My Lord....” She broke off, hesitating.\n“Yes?”\nHe will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n“At what time will you be expecting dinner?” she asked.\nThat’s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place—alone, the two of us, without a care.\n“I'll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late. And...ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. | want him to attend our strategy conference.”\nHe cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out,\nheaded for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the Great Hall. Join her there\n######################\nOutput:",

And I cannot use my tricks on him.\n“At what time will you be expecting dinner?” she asked.\nThat’s not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place—alone, the two of us, without a care.\n“I'll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late.

His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately.”\nThe outer door slammed.\nJessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto’s father. It had been done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke’s middle years. He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto’s now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting.\n“Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!” she whispered.\n“What are your orders, Noble Born?”\nIt was a woman’s voice, thin and stringy.\nJessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray- haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course—that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white—secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.\nThe woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: “I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born. What are your\norders?”\n“You may refer to me as ‘my Lady,’” Jessica said. “I’m not noble born. I’m the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.”\nAgain that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning. “There’s a wife, then?”\n“There is not, nor has there ever been. | am the Duke’s only...companion, the mother of his heir- designate.”\nEven as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words. What was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Yes—/I am meeting more resistance lately. | could use a quiet retreat by myself.\nA weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: “Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo- Sook!” Then: “Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!” And again: “Soo-soo-Sook!”\n“What is that?” Jessica asked. “I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning.”\n“Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you’ve no need to interest yourself in such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it’s always kept full.” She glanced down at her dress. “Why, you know, my Lady, | don’t even have to wear my stillSuit here?” She cackled. “And me not even dead!”\nJessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more imperative.\nr\nStill, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.\n“My husband told me of your title, Shadout,” Jessica said. “I recognized the word. It’s a very ancient word.”\n“You know the ancient tongues then?” Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity.\n“Tongues are the Bene Gesserit’s first learning,” Jessica said. “I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.”\nMapes nodded. “Just as the legend says.”\nAnd Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.\n“I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,” Jessica said. She read the more obvious Signs in Mapes’ actions and appearance, the petit betrayals. “Miseces prejia,” she said in the Chakobsa tongue. “Andral t’re pera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri—”\nMapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.\n“I know many things,” Jessica said. “I know that you have borne children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. | know many things.”\nIn a low voice, Mapes said: “I meant no offense, my Lady.”\n“You speak of the legend and seek answers,” Jessica said. “Beware the answers you may find. |\nknow you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.”\n“My Lady, I....”\n“There’s a remote possibility you could draw my life’s blood,” Jessica said, “but in so doing you'd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know—even for an entire people.”\n“My Lady!” Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. “The weapon was Sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.”\n“And as the means of my death should | prove otherwise,” Jessica said. She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so terrifying in combat.\nNow we see which way the decision tips, she thought.\nSlowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk- white blade, held it up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was double-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long.\n“Do you know this, my Lady?” Mapes asked.\nIt could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor and wild gossip.\n“It’s a crysknife,” she said.\n“Say it not lightly,” Mapes said. “Do you know its meaning?”\nAnd Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here’s the reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could precipitate violence or...what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of a Knife. She’s called the Shadout in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that’s “Death Maker” in Chakobsa. She’s getting restive. | must answer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer.\nJessica said: “It’s a maker—”\n“Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!” Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room.\nJessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch.\nThe key word was...Maker.\nMaker? Maker.\nStill, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.\nJessica said: “Did you think that I, Knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the Maker?”\nMapes lowered the knife. “My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.”\nJessica thought about the prophecy—the Shari-a and all the panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long centuries ago—long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserit’s need.\nWell, that day had come.\nMapes returned knife to sheath, said: “This is an unfixed blade, my Lady. Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate. It’s yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live.”\nJessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: “Mapes, you’ve sheathed that blade unblooded.”\nWith a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica’s hand, tore open the brown bodice, wailing: “Take the water of my life!”\nJessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman. Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew a delicate scratch with the blade’s edge above Mapes’ left breast. There was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thought. A moisture- conserving mutation?\nShe sheathed the blade, said: “Button your dress, Mapes.”\nMapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites Stared at Jessica. “You are ours,” she muttered. “You\nare the One.”\nThere came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica’s bodice. “Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!” she snarled. “You know that, my Lady!”\n| know it now, Jessica thought.\nThe cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.\nMapes composed herself, said: “The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You’ve been entrusted with a crysknife.” She took a deep breath. “Now the thing must take its course. It cannot be hurried.” She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them. “And there’s work aplenty to while the time for us here.”\nJessica hesitated. “The thing must take its course.” That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva’s stock of incantations— The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.\nBut I’m not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: “What’ll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?”\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.”\nMapes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head,” she said. She stooped. “lIl have to be cleaning this first, won’t I, my Lady?”\n“No.”\n“But there’s dirt caked on its horns.”\n“That’s not dirt, Mapes. That’s the blood of our Duke’s father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after\n######################\nOutput:",

And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!\nIn matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: “What’ll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?”\nInstinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.”\nMapes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head,” she said. She stooped. “lIl have to be cleaning this first, won’t I, my Lady?”\n“No.”\n“But there’s dirt caked on its horns.”\n“That’s not dirt, Mapes. That’s the blood of our Duke’s father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed the Old Duke.”\nMapes stood up. “Ah, now!” she said.\n“It’s just blood,” Jessica said. “Old blood at that. Get some help hanging these now. The beastly things are heavy.”\n“Did you think the blood bothered me?” Mapes asked. “I’m of the desert and I’ve seen blood aplenty.”\n“l,..see that you have,” Jessica said.\n“And some of it my own,” Mapes said. “More’n you drew with your puny scratch.”\n“You'd rather Il’d cut deeper?”\n“Ah, no! The body’s water is scant enough ‘thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air. You did the thing right.”\nAnd Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in the phrase, “the body’s water.” Again she felt a sense of oppression at the importance of water on Arrakis.\n“On which side of the dining hall shall | hang which one of these pretties, my Lady?” Mapes asked.\nEver the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: “Use your own judgment, Mapes. It\nmakes no real difference.”\n“AS you say, my Lady.” Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head. “Killed an old duke, did you?” she crooned.\n“Shall | summon a handler to help you?” Jessica asked.\n“PIL manage, my Lady.”\nYes, she'll manage, Jessica thought. There’s that about this Fremen creature: the drive to manage.\nJessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here. Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. “It cannot be hurried,” Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this place that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawat’s suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the feeling.\n“When you've finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes,” Jessica said. “One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things should go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any questions I'll be in the south wing.”\n“As you will, my Lady,” Mapes said.\nJessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe, but there’s something wrong about the place. | can feel it.\nAn urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family\nwings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.\nBehind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull’s head, looked at the retreating back. “She’s the One all right,” she muttered. “Poor thing.”\n“Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!” goes the refrain. “A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!”\n—FROM “A CHILD'S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it\ninto a room with yellow walls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases, a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right, bracketing another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs. At the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his back to her, his attention fixed upon the outside world.\nJessica took another silent step into the room.\nShe saw that Yueh’s coat was wrinkled, a white Smudge near the left elbow as though he had leaned against chalk. He looked, from behind, like a fleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy movement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block of head with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the shoulder seemed alive—turning slightly to follow some movement outside.\nAgain, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the closed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had expressed a liking.\n“Good afternoon, Dr. Yueh,” she said. “Where’s Paul?”\nHe nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner without turning: “Your son grew tired, Jessica. | sent him into the next room to rest.”\nAbruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips. “Forgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away...I...did not mean to be familiar.”\nShe smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might kneel. “Wellington, please.”\n“To use your name like that...I....\n“We've known each other six years,” she said. “It’s long past time formalities should’ve been dropped between us—in private.”\nYueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: / believe it has worked. Now, she’ll think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She'll not look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.\n“l'm afraid | was woolgathering,” he said. “Whenever I...feel especially sorry for you, I’m afraid | think of you as...well, Jessica.”\n“Sorry for me? Whatever for?”\nYueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with Jessica whenever possible. It was safest.\n“You’ve seen this place, my...Jessica.” He stumbled over the name, plunged ahead: “So barren\n”\nafter Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us.”\nShe folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm’s tooth, if the reports were right. “It’s just that we’re strange to them—different people, different customs. They’ve known only the Harkonnens.” She looked past him out the windows. “What were you staring at out there?”\nHe turned back to the window. “The people.”\nJessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the house where Yueh’s attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated them from the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the people—a house shield—and went on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.\nThe pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing people looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate...even a sense of hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.\n“Do you know what they’re thinking?” Yueh asked.\n“You profess to read minds?” she asked.\n“Those minds,” he said. “They look at those trees and they think: ‘There are one hundred of us.’ That’s what they think.”\nShe turned a puzzled frown on him. “Why?”\n“Those are date palms,” he said. “One date palm requires forty liters of water a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out there—one hundred men.”\n“But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.”\n“They but hope some dates will fall, except it’s the wrong season.”\n“We look at this place with too critical an eye,” she said. “There’s hope as well as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can make this world into whatever we wish.”\nAnd she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The laugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. “But you can’t buy security,” she said.\nYueh turned away to hide his face from her. /f only it were possible to hate these people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like his Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his purpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be dead. He had to be certain.\n“Do not worry for us, Wellington,” Jessica said. “The problem’s ours, not yours.”\nShe thinks | worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But I must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one chance to strike him where he is weakest—in his gloating moment!\nHe sighed.\n“Would it disturb Paul if | looked in on him?” she asked.\n“Not at all. | gave him a sedative.”\n“He’s taking the change well?” she asked.\n“Except for getting a bit overtired. He’s excited, but what fifteen-year-old wouldn’t be under these circumstances?” He crossed to the door, opened it. “He’s in here.”\nJessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.\nPaul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of Shadows across face and blanket.\nJessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own. But the hair was the Duke’s— coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed the lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was suddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her son’s features—her lines in eyes and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity emerging from childhood.\nShe thought of the boy’s features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns—endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh’s presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.\nYueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. / know as a doctor there was no physical reason\nagainst it. Was there some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.\nFor the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.\nJessica stopped beside him, said: “What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child.”\nHe spoke mechanically\n######################\nOutput:",

The too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast—light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.\n“The sky’s so dark,” she said.\n“That’s partly the lack of moisture,” he said.\n“Water!” she snapped. “Everywhere you turn here, you’re involved with the lack of water!”\n“It’s the precious mystery of Arrakis,” he said.\n“Why is there so little of it? There’s volcanic rock here. There're a dozen power sources | could name.\nThere’s polar ice. They say you can’t drill in the desert—storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed, if the worms don’t get you first. They’ve never found water traces there, anyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that’ve been drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?”\n“First a trickle, then nothing,” he said.\n“But, Wellington, that’s the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?”\n“It is curious,” he said. “You suspect some living agency? Wouldn’t that have shown in core samples?”\n“What would have shown? Alien plant matter...or animal? Who could recognize it?” She turned back to the slope. “The water is stopped. Something plugs it. That’s my suspicion.”\n“Perhaps the reason’s known,” he said. “The Harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress this.”\n“What reason?” she asked. “And then there’s the atmospheric moisture. Little enough of it, certainly, but there’s some. It’s the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?”\n“The polar caps?”\n“Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind the Harkonnen veil that bear\nclose investigation, and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice.”\n“We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,” he said. “Perhaps we'll....” He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. “Is something wrong?”\n“The way you say ‘Harkonnen,’” she said. “Even my Duke’s voice doesn’t carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. | didn’t know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.”\nGreat Mother! he thought. /’ve aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me. There’s only one solution: tell the truth as far as | can.\nHe said: “You didn’t know that my wife, my Wanna....” He shrugged, unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: “They....” The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.\n“Forgive me,” Jessica said. “I did not mean to open an old wound.” And she thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit—the signs are all over him. And it’s obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here’s another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.\n“lam sorry,” he said. “I’m unable to talk about it.” He opened his eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.\nJessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a\nr\ncurved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over her.\n“Wellington, I’m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,” she said.\n“I came willingly,” he said. And that, too, was true.\n“But this whole planet’s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.”\n“It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,” he said. And that, too, was true.\n“Perhaps | should be more confident of him,” she said. “He is a brilliant tactician.”\n“We've been uprooted,” he said. “That’s why we're uneasy.”\n“And how easy it Is to kill the uprooted plant,” she said. “Especially when you put it down in hostile soil.”\n“Are we certain the soil’s hostile?”\n“There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was adding to the population,” She said. “They stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.”\n“There is only so much water to support human life here,” he said. “The people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn’t follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him.”\n“And guards,” she said. “Guards everywhere. And Shields. You see the blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.”\n“Give this planet a chance,” he said.\nBut Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. “I can smell death in this place,” she said. “Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There’ve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.’ She shook her head. “Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.”\n“You malign him.”\n“Malign? | praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. | just do not fool myself about Thufir’s methods.”\n“You should...keep busy,” he said. “Give yourself no time for such morbid—”\n“Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? | am the Duke’s secretary—so busy that each day | learn new things to fear...things even he doesn’t suspect | know.” She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: “Sometimes | wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.”\n“What do you mean?” He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose.\n“Don’t you think, Wellington,” she asked, “that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?”\n“That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.”\nThe rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt about his concubine. One\nr\nhad only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.\nShe sighed. “You're right. It’s not worthy.”\nAgain, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.\n“There’ll be much bloodshed soon,” she said. “The Harkonnens won't rest until they’re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood—no matter what the distance—while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin.”\n“The old feud,” Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or—worse— left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.\n“What are you thinking?” she asked.\n“Iam thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand solaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things.”\n“Does greed touch even you, Wellington?”\n“Not greed.”\n“What then?”\nHe shrugged. “Futility.” He glanced at her. “Can you remember your first taste of spice?”\n“It tasted like cinnamon.”\n“But never twice the same,” he said. “It’s like life —it presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable—slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.”\n“I think it would’ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach,” she said.\nHe saw that she hadn’t been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: Yes—why didn’t she make him do this? She could make him do virtually anything.\nHe spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: “Would you think it bold of me... Jessica, if | asked a personal question?”\nShe pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet. “Of course not. You’re...my friend.”\n“Why haven’t you made the Duke marry you?”\nShe whirled, head up, glaring. “Made him marry me? But—”\n“I should not have asked,” he said.\n“No.” She shrugged. “There’s good political reason —as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And....” She sighed. “...motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It\ndegrades everything it touches. If | made him do... this, then it would not be his doing.”\n“It’s a thing my Wanna might have said,” he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.\nJessica spoke, shattering the moment. “Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men. One of them | love very\n######################\nOutput:",

That’s the man Shaped by the father.” Her face contorted. “If only that old man had died when my Duke was born!”\nIn the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds. Presently, she took a deep breath, said, “Leto’s\nright—these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.” She turned, sweeping the room with her gaze. “If you’ll excuse me, Wellington, | want another look through this wing before | assign quarters.”\nHe nodded. “Of course.” And he thought: /f only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.\nJessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out. A// the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no doubt. He’s a good man. Again, She hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh\nand drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn he’s so easily read. | should place more trust in my friends.\nMany have remarked the speed with which Muad’Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.\n—FROM “THE HUMANITY OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nP aul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh’s sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his mother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn’t approve. Things were too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.\nIf I slip out without asking I haven’t disobeyed orders. And I will stay in the house where it’s safe.\nHe heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were indistinct—something about the spice...the Harkonnens. The conversation rose and fell.\nPaul’s attention went to the carved headboard of his bed—a false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room’s functions. A\nleaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He knew if he pushed the fish’s one visible eye that would turn on the room’s Suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another changed the temperature.\nQuietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side. The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.\nIt was as though the room had been designed to entice him.\nThe room and this planet.\nHe thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him —\"“Arrakis: His Imperial Majesty’s Desert Botanical Testing Station.” It was an old filmbook from before discovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul’s mind, each with its picture imprinted by the book’s mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush...kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse....\nNames and pictures, names and pictures from man’s terranic past—and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.\nSo many new things to learn about—the spice.\nAnd the sandworms.\nA door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother’s footsteps retreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and remain in the other room.\nNow was the moment to go exploring.\nPaul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet. He Stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.\nFrom behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter- seeker no more than five centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once—a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some nearby hand and eye. It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.\nThe seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.\nThrough Paul’s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the room to reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion—anything that moved. A shield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance—and there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.\nNow, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat.\nThe hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.\nI must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom. | must grip tightly.\nThe thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.\nWho is operating that thing? Paul wondered. /t has to be someone near. | could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.\nThe hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.\nThe hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.\nPaul’s right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing’s nose against the metal doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand.\nStill, he held it—to be certain.\nPaul’s eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes.\n“Your father has sent for you,” she said. “There are men in the hall to escort you.”\nPaul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sacklike dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand.\n“I’ve heard of suchlike,” she said. “It would’ve killed me, not so?”\nHe had to swallow before he could speak. “I...was its target.”\n“But it was coming for me.”\n“Because you were moving.” And he wondered: Who is this creature?\n“Then you saved my life,” she said.\n“I saved both our lives.”\n“Seems like you could’ve let it have me and made your own escape,” she said.\n“Who are you?” he asked.\n“The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.”\n“How did you know where to find me?”\n“Your mother told me. | met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall.” She pointed to her right. “Your father’s men are still waiting.”\nThose will be Hawat’s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this thing.\n“Go to my father’s men,” he said. “Tell them I’ve caught a hunter-seeker in the house and they’re to Spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately. They’ll know how to go about it. The operator’s sure to be a stranger among us.”\nAnd he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn’t. The seeker had been under control when she entered.\n“Before | do your bidding, manling,” Mapes said, “l must cleanse the way between us. You’ve put a water burden on me that I’m not sure I care to Support. But we Fremen pay our debts—be they black debts or\nwhite debts. And it’s known to us that you’ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we’re certain sure of it. Mayhap there’s the hand guided that flesh-cutter.”\nPaul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.\nHe thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it. She’d told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat’s men in a minute.\nHis mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memory— prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.\nStill gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.\nShe’d said his mother was someplace down here— Stairs...a weirding room.\nWhat had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: “Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it’s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\nOval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house\n######################\nOutput:",

Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: “Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it’s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.\nOval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.\nThrough the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the hall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.\nJessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her sliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.\nSurely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one individual’s hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And\nthere were ways to open any palm lock—as she had learned at school.\nJessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the lines—a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the surface.\nShe felt the click.\nBut there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.\n“There are men in the great hall say they’ve been sent by the Duke to get young master Paul,” Mapes said. “They've the ducal signet and the guard has identified them.” She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.\nA cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That’s a good sign.\n“He’s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,” Jessica said. “If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next room. Paul may require a wakeshot.”\nAgain, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.\nHawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can’t be anything too terrible in here.\nShe pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.\nAn airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, Saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat’s personal mark. The door was left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.\nShe stepped over the lip into the little room.\nWhy an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in Special climates.\nSpecial climate!\nThat would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing things had to be irrigated. The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open securely with the stick\nHawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She recognized Galach words, read:\n“O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God’s Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.”\nJessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.\nA yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Fi/ter glass!\nShe stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.\n“A wet-planet conservatory,” she breathed.\nPotted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso...roses....\nEven roses!\nShe bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room.\nRhythmic noise invaded her senses.\nShe parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a- gallop onto the metal bowl.\nJessica sent herself through the quick sense- clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the room’s perimeter. It appeared to be about ten meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original building’s completion.\nShe stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock- set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.\nWater everywhere in this room—on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life. Water being\nwasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness.\nShe glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting Known as the Shield Wall.\nFilter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn’t been time. And he’s been busy with more serious problems.\nShe recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust.\nBut this room embodied a statement far more Significant than the lack of waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis— possibly more.\nJessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat’s daysigns on it, studied a message written on the pad:\n“TO THE LADY JESSICA—\nMay this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.\nMy kindest wishes, MARGOT LADY FENRING”\nJessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor’s former proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count married his Lady.\nEven as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: “On that path lies danger.”\nJessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots. Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.\nSomething in the position of the pad? she wondered.\nBut Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:\n“Your son and the Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection.” Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots: “l do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that | cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.”\nJessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.\n“Paul!” She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. “What is that?”\nHe spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: “Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my\nroom and smashed its nose, but | want to be Sure. Water should short it out.”\n“Immerse it!” she commanded.\nHe obeyed.\nPresently, she said: “Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.”\nHe brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.\nIt was dead.\nShe dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized—the B.G. Way.\n“This place could conceal anything,” he said.\n“I’ve reason to believe it’s safe,” she said.\n“My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said—”\n“It was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.”\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: ^“... defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n“Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,” he said. “That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.”\n“The Shadout Mapes,” Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. “A summons from your father to—”\n“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe\n######################\nOutput:",

Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.”\n“One moment, please,” Kynes said. “With your permission, Sire, | must check the security of your Suits.”\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: “I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours...\nmy Lord. I’m well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care.”\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet...to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?\nThe thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. “We're in your hands,” the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe, Saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where he was. “And, if you’d be so kind,” the Duke said, “I’d appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.”\n“Certainly,” Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals, speaking as he examined the suit. “It’s basically a micro-sandwich—a high- efficiency filter and heat-exchange system.” He adjusted the shoulder seals. “The skin-contact layer’s porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body...near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers...” Kynes tightened the chest fit. “... include heat-exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt’s reclaimed.”\nThe Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: “Most interesting.”\n“Breathe deeply,” Kynes said.\nThe Duke obeyed.\nKynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. “Motions of the body, especially breathing,” he said, “and some osmotic action provide the pumping\nforce.” He loosened the chest fit slightly. “Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck.”\nThe Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube. “Efficient and convenient,” he said. “Good engineering.”\nKynes knelt, examined the leg seals. “Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads,” he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned flap there. “In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won’t lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day—even if you’re caught in the Great Erg.”\n“A thimbleful a day,” the Duke said.\nKynes pressed a finger against the suit’s forehead pad, said: “This may rub a little. If it irritates you, please tell me. | could slit-patch it a bit tighter.”\n“My thanks,” the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now—tighter and less irritating.\nKynes turned to Paul. “Now, let’s have a look at you, lad.”\nA good man but he'll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.\nPaul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting\nthe adhesion tabs under Gurney’s inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.\nKynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. “You’ve worn a stillSuit before?” he asked.\n“This is the first time.”\n“Then someone adjusted it for you?”\n“No.”\n“Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do that?”\n“It...seemed the right way.”\n“That it most certainly is.”\nAnd Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: “He shall know your ways as though born to them.”\n“We waste time,” the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting ‘thopter, led the way, accepting the guard’s salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his Safety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard.\nKynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft—soft luxury of gray- green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive.\nSo soft! he thought.\n“All secure, Sire,” Halleck said.\nLeto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip —once, twice. They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.\n“Southeast over the Shield Wall,” Kynes said. “That’s where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment.”\n“Right.”\nThe Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast.\n“The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication,” the Duke said.\n“Someday | may show you a sietch factory,” Kynes said.\n“I would find that interesting,” the Duke said. “l note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.”\n“Inferior copies,” Kynes said. “Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit.”\n“And it'll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?”\n“Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major water loss is through the palms of your hands,” Kynes said. “You can wear suit gloves if you’re not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It inhibits perspiration.”\nThe Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield Wall—chasms of tortured\nrock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black lines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space and left it where it Smashed.\nThey crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into the basin—a dry delta outlined against darker rock.\nKynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the waist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheaths and the sheaths appeared well worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.\n“When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you say we observed the rules?” Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to their course.\n“The Harkonnens left; you came,” Kynes said.\n“And is everything as it should be?” Leto asked.\nMomentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes’ jaw. “As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, | am a direct subject of the Imperium...my Lord.”\nThe Duke smiled grimly. “But we both know the realities.”\n“I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.”\n“Indeed? And what is your work?”\nIn the brief silence, Paul thought: He’s pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren landscape.\nKynes spoke stiffly: “You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.”\n“Of course.”\n“It is mostly dry land biology and botany...some geological work—core drilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire planet.”\n“Do you also investigate the spice?”\nKynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man’s cheek. “A curious question, my Lord.”\n“Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those of the Harkonnens. | don’t care if you study the spice as long as | share what you discover.” He glanced at the planetologist. “The Harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice, didn’t they?”\nKynes stared back without answering.\n“You may speak plainly,” the Duke said, “without fear for your skin.”\n“The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,” Kynes muttered. And he thought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?\nThe Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. “I detect a sour note in your voice, sir. We’ve waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we’re different from the Harkonnens?”\n“I’ve seen the propaganda you’ve flooded into sietch and village,” Kynes said. “‘Love the good Duke!’ Your corps of—”\n“Here now!” Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward.\nPaul put a hand on Halleck’s arm.\n“Gurney!” the Duke said. He glanced back. “This man’s been long under the Harkonnens.”\nHalleck sat back. “Ayah.”\n“Your man Hawat’s subtle,” Kynes said, “but his object’s plain enough.”\n“Will you open those bases to us, then?” the Duke asked.\nKynes spoke curtly: “They’re His Majesty’s property.”\n“They're not being used.”\n“They could be used.”\n“Does His Majesty concur?”\nKynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. “Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!”\nHe didn’t answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: “How is a planet to become an Eden without money?”\n“What is money,” Kynes asked, “if it won’t buy the services you need?”\nAh, now! the Duke thought. And he said: “We'll discuss this another time. Right now, I believe we're coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do | hold the Same course?”\n“The same course,” Kynes muttered.\nPaul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged Shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Paul couldn’t be sure.\n“Are there any plants down there?” Paul asked.\n“Some,” Kynes said. “This latitude’s life-zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers—adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate that\n######################\nOutput:",

Hawat said—”\n“It was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could’ve been spirited in here after Hawat’s investigation.”\nBut she thought of the message of the leaf: ^“... defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.\n“Hawat’s men are searching the house right now,” he said. “That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.”\n“The Shadout Mapes,” Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. “A summons from your father to—”\n“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”\nShe pointed to the note, explained about it.\nHe relaxed slightly.\nBut Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.\nPaul spoke matter-of-factly: “It’s the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them.”\nA rapping sounded at the airlock door—the code knock of one of Hawat’s corps.\n“Come in,” Paul called.\nThe door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room. “There you are, sir,” he said. “The housekeeper said you'd be here.” He glanced around the room. “We found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console.”\n“I'll want to take part in the interrogation,” Jessica said.\n“Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.”\n“Nothing to identify him?” she asked.\n“We've found nothing yet, my Lady.”\n“Was he an Arrakeen native?” Paul asked.\nJessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.\n“He has the native look,” the man said. “Put into that cairn more’n a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday. l'Il stake my reputation on it.”\n“No one questions your thoroughness,” Jessica said.\n“I question it, my Lady. We should’ve used sonic probes down there.”\n“|I presume that’s what you’re doing now,” Paul said.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Send word to my father that we'll be delayed.”\n“At once, sir.” He glanced at Jessica. “It’s Hawat’s order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.” Again, his eyes swept the room. “What of this place?”\n“I’ve reason to believe it safe,” she said. “Both Hawat and I have inspected it.”\n“Then l'Il mount guard outside here, m’Lady, until we've been over the house once more.” He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door closed behind him.\nPaul broke the sudden silence, saying: “Had we better go over the house later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss.”\n“This wing was the only place | hadn’t examined,” She said. “I put it off to last because....”\n“Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,” he said.\nShe darted a quick look at his face, questioning.\n“Do you distrust Hawat?” she asked.\n“No, but he’s getting old...he’s overworked. We could take some of the load from him.”\n“That'd only shame him and impair his efficiency,” She said. “A stray insect won’t be able to wander into\nthis wing after he hears about this. He’ll be shamed that....”\n“We must take our own measures,” he said.\n“Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,” she said. “He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him...many times over.”\nPaul said: “When my father is bothered by something you’ve done he says ‘Bene Gesserit!’ like a swear word.”\n“And what is it about me that bothers your father?”\n“When you argue with him.”\n“You are not your father, Paul.”\nAnd Paul thought: /t’// worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.\n“What're you holding back?” Jessica asked. “This isn’t like you, Paul.”\nHe shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.\nAnd Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.\n“My father must learn of this at once,” he said. “I'll radiograph it in code and get it off.”\n“No,” she said. “You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it.”\n“Do you mean we should trust no one?”\n“There’s another possibility,” she said. “This message may have been meant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it’s true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.”\nPaul’s face remained sturdily somber. “To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way,” he said.\n“You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it,” she said.\n“I understand.”\nShe turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking—a yellowed ball above the cliffs.\nPaul turned with her, said: “I don’t think it’s Hawat, either. Is it possible it’s Yueh?”\n“He’s not a lieutenant or companion,” she said. “And | can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.”\nPaul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn’t be Gurney...or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible. They're all from families that’ve been loyal to us for generations —for good reason.\nJessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here! She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard— lines of spice silos in it with stilt-legged watchtowers Standing around it like so many startled spiders. She could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall—silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.\nSlowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear,\nprecise rhythm—a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink- blink-blink...\nPaul stirred beside her in the dusky room.\nBut Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.\nSomeone signaling!\nShe tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.\nOther lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff—very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!\nAnd it was gone.\nThe false star in the cliff winked out immediately.\nSignals...and they filled her with premonition.\nWhy were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why couldn’t they use the communications network?\nThe answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemies—between Harkonnen agents.\nThere came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat’s man: “All clear, sir...m’Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his father.”\nIt is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.\n—FROM “MUAD’DIB: FAMILY COMMENTARIES” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet\nof the landing control tower outside Arrakeen. The night’s first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze—yellow...white...blue.\nHe thought of the notices posted now above his Signature all through the populous places of the planet: “Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.”\nThe ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis... and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe rage was difficult to suppress.\nHe saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawat’s lieutenant.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nHe shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries.\nBetter a cautious delay than...\nThe lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.\n“Our Sublime Padishah Emperor....”\nIf the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor’s private note to his “Noble Duke”—the disdainful allusions to veiled men and women: “...but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?”\nThe Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles Caladan...but l'Il never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. | may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—\n“My lungs taste the air of Time Blown past falling sands....”\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert—barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps\n######################\nOutput:",

He could not bring himself to call this\ndry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.\nI must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to have a home, this must be it. | may think of Arrakis as a hell I’ve reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.\nA wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated—\n“My lungs taste the air of Time Blown past falling sands....”\nWell, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert—barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.\nProvided the Harkonnens hadn't managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nA scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms. Blast Shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.\nShuttle’s coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to\nremain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nThe men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their soacebags over their shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.\n“Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That’s gravity, man!” “How many G’s does this place pull? Feels heavy.” “Nine-tenths of a G by the book.”\nThe crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.\n“Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where’s all the loot this place’s supposed to have?” “The Harkonnens took it with ’em!” “Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!” “Haven’t you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You scrub your ass with sand!” “Hey! Can it! The Duke!”\nThe Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.\nGurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine- string baliset clutched in the other hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.\nThe Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had called him? “Gurney, the valorous.”\nHalleck’s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip Slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed.\n“Gurney,” Leto said.\n“My Lord.” He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. “This is the last of them. I’d have preferred coming in with the first wave, but....”\n“There are still some Harkonnens for you,” the Duke said. “Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk.”\n“Yours to command, my Lord.”\nThey moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.\n“How many men can you let Hawat have?” the Duke asked.\n“Is Thufir in trouble, Sire?”\n“He’s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare—men who won't balk at a little knife work.”\n“I can let him have three hundred of my best,” Halleck said. “Where shall | send them?”\n“To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.”\n“Shall | get about it at once, Sire?”\n“In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttle’s Supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice.”\n“Our spice, m’Lord?”\n“Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime. They’ve opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us.”\n“How strong a persuasion, Sire?”\n“| want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and skills we need. The fact that they’re leaving suggests they’re not part of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.”\n“Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m’Lord.”\n“And there are some he hasn’t found. But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.”\n“Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?”\n“Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. | Suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer\ntwenty per cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens.”\n“No more than that, Sire? | know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them...well, Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.”\nLeto spoke impatiently: “Then use your own discretion in particular cases. Just remember that the treasury isn’t bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men—any with open sand experience.”\n“I understand, Sire. ‘They shall come all for violence: their faces shall Sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.’”\n“A very moving quotation,” the Duke said. “Turn your crew over to a lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will direct them. And don’t forget the men for Hawat.”\n“Three hundred of the best, Sire.” He took up his Spacebag. “Where shall | report to you when I’ve completed my chores?”\n“I’ve taken over a council room topside here. We'll hold staff there. | want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first.”\nHalleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto’s eye. “Are you anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? | thought there was a Judge of the Change here.”\n“Both open battle and secret,” the Duke said. “There'll be blood aplenty spilled here before we're through.”\n““And the water which thou takest out of the river Shall become blood upon the dry land,’” Halleck quoted.\nThe Duke sighed. “Hurry back, Gurney.”\n“Very good, m’Lord.” The whipscar rippled to his grin. “‘Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go | forth to my work.’” He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.\nLeto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual amazement—a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases...and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.\nPresently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were Safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men.\nThe Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a Signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.\nCommand must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.\nHe breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.\nThey have tried to take the life of my son!\nOver the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad’Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father’s first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They said: “O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.”\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n“Trs whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,” the Duke said, “but when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged in...other things.”\nHe knew he wasn’t holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.\nThe Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old- fashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.\nThe Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: “Hawat told me that house was secure!”\nPaul spoke hesitantly: “I was angry, too—at first. And | blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would’ve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others—including Hawat.”\n“Are you defending him?” the Duke demanded.\n“Yes,”\n“He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be—”\n“He’s wise with much experience,” Paul said. “How many of Hawat’s mistakes can you recall?”\n“I should be the one defending him,” the Duke said. “Not you.”\nPaul smiled.\nLeto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s.\n######################\nOutput:",

He’ll direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him.”\nPaul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the night’s blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.\nThe door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more\nleathery than ever. He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.\n“My Lord,” he said, speaking to a point over Leto’s head, “I have just learned how | failed you. It becomes necessary that | tender my resig—”\n“Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,” the Duke said. He waved to the chair across from Paul. “If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn’t count on simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training. You didn’t fail there!” He tapped the back of the empty chair. “Sit down, I say!”\nHawat sank into the chair. “But—”\n“FIL hear no more of it,” the Duke said. “The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?”\n“I asked them to wait outside while |—”\n“Call them in.”\nHawat looked into Leto’s eyes. “Sire, |—”\n“I know who my true friends are, Thufir,” the Duke said. “Call in the men.”\nHawat swallowed. “At once, my Lord.” He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: “Gurney, bring them in.”\nHalleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.\n“There’s coffee for those who want it,” the Duke said.\nHe looked over his men, thinking: They're a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.\nPresently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.\n“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “our civilization appears to’ve fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.”\nDry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.\n“I think first we’d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen,” the Duke said. “Thufir?”\nHawat glanced up. “I’ve some economic matters to go into after my general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need. They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly. They’ve sent us a gift—stillsuits of their own manufacture...maps of certain desert areas Surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind....” He glanced down at the table. “Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with\nthe Judge of the Change. They’ve also sent some incidental things—jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.”\n“You like these people, Thufir?” asked a man down the table.\nHawat turned to face his questioner. “Duncan Idaho says they’re to be admired.”\nPaul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: “Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?”\nHawat looked at Paul. “From food processing and other evidence, Idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We’ve reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.”\n“That’s something new,” Leto said.\n“It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.”\nAnother man down the table cleared his throat, asked: “Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?”\n“A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen- day journey.”\n“It appears,” the Duke said, “that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We Shouldn’t worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet—it’s always done. But to have\nthem completely outside our observation—that’s not good.”\n“You have a plan, Sire,” Hawat asked.\nThe Duke looked at Halleck. “Gurney, | want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them l'Il ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.”\n“What if the Emperor gets wind of this?” Halleck asked. “He’s very jealous of his CHOAM profits, m’Lord.”\nLeto smiled. “We'll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight that! And we'll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system. No more graft!”\nA grin twisted Halleck’s face. “Ahh, m’Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would that | could see the Baron’s face when he learns of this.”\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. “Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?”\n“Yes, my Lord. They’re being examined in detail even now. I’ve skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.”\n“Give it, then.”\n“The Harkonnens took ten billion solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.”\nA muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some\nboredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.\nHalleck murmured: “‘For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.’”\n“You see, gentlemen,” Leto said. “Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?”\nThere was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.\n“We will have to take it at the point of the sword,” Leto said. He turned to Hawat. “This’d be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and Supporting equipment have they left us?”\n“A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord,” Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. “They neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands—that everything the Harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart. We'll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it’s still working six months from now.”\n“Pretty much as we expected,” Leto said. “What’s the firm estimate on basic equipment?”\nHawat glanced at his folder. “About nine hundred and thirty harvester factories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty\nornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation...carryalls, a little under a thousand.”\nHalleck said: “Wouldn’t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?”\nThe Duke looked at Hawat. “Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?”\n“We must pursue other avenues for now,” Hawat said. “The Guild agent wasn’t really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain—one Mentat to another—that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.”\nOne of Halleck’s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: “There’s no justice in this!”\n“Justice?” The Duke looked at the man. “Who asks for justice? We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis—win or die. Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?”\nThe man stared at the Duke, then: “No, Sire. You couldn’t turn and | could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but....” He shrugged. “...we must all feel bitter at times.”\n“Bitterness | understand,” the Duke said. “But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind.”\nHalleck stirred, said: “I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as ‘Leto the Just’ and\npromise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.”\n“They don’t know yet who’s going to win this exchange,” the Duke said. “Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few\n######################\nOutput:",

One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery?”\nHawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.\nA solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get a better look at it.\nPaul leaned forward, staring at the machine.\nScaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was basically a long, buglike body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.\n“This is a harvester factory,” Hawat said. “We chose one in good repair for this projection. There’s one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it’s still running... although I don’t know how...or why.”\n“If that’s the one they call ‘Old Maria,’ it belongs in a museum,” an aide said. “I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over their workers’ heads. Be good or you'll be assigned to Old Maria.”\nChuckles sounded around the table.\nPaul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the table, said: “Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?”\nQuick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No—they have to face the realities here.\n“There’re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp,” Hawat said. “Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicing’s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.”\n“Why don’t we shield them?” Paul asked.\n“According to Idaho’s report,” Hawat said, “shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We’ve the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho Saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.”\n“None at all?” Paul asked.\n“It'd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people,” Hawat said. “Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw no Shields or any indication of their use.”\n“It’s a puzzle,” the Duke said.\n“The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,” Hawat said. “They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.”\n“Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?” Paul asked.\n“It doesn’t seem likely,” Hawat said. “It’s theoretically possible, of course—a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one’s ever been able to put it to the test.”\n“We'd have heard about it before now,” Halleck said. “The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would’ve acquired such a device if it were available. And they’d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.”\n“I don’t like an unanswered question of this importance,” Leto said. “Thufir, | want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.”\n“We're already working on it, my Lord.” He cleared his throat. “Ah-h, Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn’t mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.”\nThe Duke frowned, then: “The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.”\nHawat gestured to his aide at the projector.\nThe solido-image of the harvester factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. “This is a Carryall,” Hawat said. “It’s essentially a large ‘thopter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to Spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a Sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.”\n“Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,” the Duke said.\nLaughter was abrupt and too loud.\nAn ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.\n“These ‘thopters are fairly conventional,” Hawat said. “Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded—possibly discarding the shield generator’s weight for greater range.”\n“I don’t like this de-emphasis on shields,” the Duke muttered. And he thought: /s this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won't even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: “Let’s get to the working estimate. What’ll our profit figure be?”\nHawat turned two pages in his notebook. “After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we’ve worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It’s based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear Safety margin.” He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: “Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We'll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.” He opened his eyes. “Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.”\n“We're working for a solid and permanent planetary base,” the Duke said. “We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy—especially the Fremen.”\n“Most especially the Fremen,” Hawat agreed.\n“Our supremacy on Caladan,” the Duke said, “depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it’s possible it may not. | call your attention to the lack of ‘thopter shields.” He Shook his head. “The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don’t dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.”\n“Then we'll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,” Hawat said. “Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.”\n“There it is,” the Duke said, “exactly as we expected. We’ll have to move fast with the Fremen. I'd like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.”\n“That’s not much time, Sire,” Hawat said.\n“We don’t have much time, as you well know. They'll be here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they'll ship in, Thufir?”\n“Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more, Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.”\n“Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council\nand matters will be much different—profits or no profits.”\n“We'll do our best, Sire.”\nPaul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat’s great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides. Aged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored Stain of sapho juice.\nSo much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.\n“We're presently in a war of assassins,” the Duke said, “but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what’s the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?”\n“We've eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain—perhaps a hundred people in all.”\n“These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,” the Duke said, “were they propertied?”\n“Most were well situated, my Lord—in the entrepreneur class.”\n“I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them,” the Duke said. “File copies with the Judge of the Change. We'll take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.”\nThufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. “A move worthy of your grandsire,\nmy Lord. It shames me | didn’t think of it first.”\nHalleck frowned across the table, noticing a deep scowl on Paul’s face. The others were smiling and nodding.\nIt’s wrong, Paul thought. This’// only make the others fight all the harder. They’ve nothing to gain by surrendering.\nHe knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.\n“| have been a stranger in a strange land,’” Halleck quoted.\nPaul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?\nThe Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. “Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?”\n“Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. | think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They’re all in useful categories.”\n“No more?” The Duke pursed his lips, then: “Well, pass the word along to—”\nA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke’s ear.\nLeto waved him back, said: “Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff.”\nPaul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho’s dark round face\nturned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\nIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: “We've taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however\n######################\nOutput:",

They’re all in useful categories.”\n“No more?” The Duke pursed his lips, then: “Well, pass the word along to—”\nA disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke’s ear.\nLeto waved him back, said: “Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff.”\nPaul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho’s dark round face\nturned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\nIdaho looked down the length of the table, said: “We've taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier—badly wounded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I’d seen how badly off the man was and Stopped to do what | could. | surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.” Idaho glanced down at Leto. “A knife, m’Lord, a knife the like of which you’ve never seen.”\n“Crysknife?” someone asked.\n“No doubt of it,” Idaho said. “Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.” He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.\n“Keep that blade in its sheath!”\nThe voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.\nA tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue—no white in them at all.\n“Let him enter,” Idaho whispered.\n“Pass that man,” the Duke said.\nThe guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.\nThe man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.\n“This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch | visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,” Idaho said.\n“Welcome, sir,” Leto said. “And why shouldn’t we unsheath this blade?”\nStilgar glanced at Idaho, said: “You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. | would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.” His gaze swept the others in the room. “But | do not know these others. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?”\n“I am the Duke Leto,” the Duke said. “Would you permit me to see this blade?”\n“PIL permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,” Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand. “I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.”\nIn the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader—a Fremen leader.\nA man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: “Who’s he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?”\n“It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed,” the Fremen said. “Thus | must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.” He passed a dark glance across Idaho.\n“They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.”\nHalleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: “The Duke Leto determines whether—”\n“One moment, please,” Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: “Sir, | honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity. | am indeed indebted to you. And | a/ways pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered—by me. And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.”\nThe Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.\nAs the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho’s voice boomed across the room: “Hold!”\nInto the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: “We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body’s moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.” And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.\nAside to the Duke, he said: “Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.”\nLeto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul’s eye, a rueful grin on his son’s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.\nThe Fremen looked at Idaho, said: “You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?”\n“He’s asking me to enlist with him, Sire,” Idaho said.\n“Would he accept a dual allegiance?” Leto asked.\n“You wish me to go with him, Sire?”\n“I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,” Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.\nIdaho studied the Fremen. “Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar? There’d be times when I'd have to return to serve my Duke.”\n“You fight well and you did your best for our friend,” Stilgar said. He looked at Leto. “Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.”\n“Duncan?” Leto asked.\n“I understand, Sire,” Idaho said.\n“It is agreed, then,” Leto said.\n“Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho,” Stilgar said. “The body of our friend remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us.”\nLeto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat’s eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.\n“I will await below,” Stilgar said, “while Idaho makes farewell with his friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.”\nStilgar started to turn away.\n“Will you not stay a while?” Leto asked.\nThe Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place.\n“Is there reason to stay?” the Fremen asked.\n“We would honor you,” the Duke said.\n“Honor requires that | be elsewhere soon,” the Fremen said. He shot another glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.\n“If the other Fremen match him, we'll serve each other well,” Leto said.\nIdaho spoke in a dry voice: “He’s a fair sample, Sire.”\n“You understand what you’re to do, Duncan?”\n“I’m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.”\n“Much depends on you, Duncan. We're going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.”\n“This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch.” Idaho hesitated, then: “And, Sire, there’s one other thing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary says there’s a Harkonnen reward of a million solaris for anyone who'll bring in a single crysknife.”\nLeto’s chin came up in a movement of obvious Surprise. “Why do they want one of those blades so badly?”\n“The knife is ground from a sandworm’s tooth; it’s the mark of the Fremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They’d question me unless | were known. | don’t look Fremen. But....”\n“Piter de Vries,” the Duke said.\n“A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,” Hawat said.\nIdaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.\n“Guard that knife,” the Duke said.\n“I understand, m’Lord.” He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. “l'Il report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language.” He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.\nThey heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.\nA look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.\n“We've much to do, Sire,” Halleck said.\n“And | keep you from your work,” Leto said.\n“| have the report on the advance bases,” Hawat said. “Shall I give it another time, Sire?”\n“Will it take long?”\n“Not for a briefing. It’s said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.”\n“Equipment in them?” the Duke asked.\n“According to the reports | have from Duncan.”\n“Where are they located?” Halleck asked.\n“The answer to that question,” Hawat said, “is invariably: ‘Liet knows.’”\n“God knows,” Leto muttered.\n“Perhaps not, Sire,” Hawat said. “You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?”\n“Serving two masters,” Halleck said. “It sounds like a religious quotation.”\n“And you should know,” the Duke said. Halleck smiled.\n“This Judge of the Change,” Leto said, “the Imperial ecologist—Kynes.... Wouldn’t he know where those bases are?”\n“Sire,” Hawat cautioned, “this Kynes is an Imperial servant.”\n“And he’s a long way from the Emperor,” Leto said. “I want those bases. They’d be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment.”\n“Sire!” Hawat said. “Those bases are still legally His Majesty’s fief.”\n“The weather here’s savage enough to destroy anything,” the Duke said. “We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases exist.”\n“\"Twere dangerous to commandeer them,” Hawat said. “Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the\nFremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.”\nPaul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father’s attitude.\n“Listen to him, Father,” Paul said in a low\n######################\nOutput:",

It’d be rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from the Imperium. We mustn't forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.”\n“Do it gently, then,” the Duke said. “I wish to know only if those bases exist.”\n“As you will, Sire.” Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.\n“All right, then,” the Duke said. “We know what we have ahead of us—work. We’ve been trained for it. We've some experience in it. We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments.” He looked at Halleck. “Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.”\n“ʻI shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,’” Halleck intoned.\n“Someday I'll catch that man without a quotation and he’ll look undressed,” the Duke said.\nChuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.\nThe Duke turned to Hawat. “Set up another command post for intelligence and communications\non this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, l'Il want to see you.”\nHawat arose, glancing around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.\nIt ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.\nFor the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat—not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.\nMy father is desperate, he thought. Things aren’t going well for us at all.\nAnd Hawat—Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference—subtle hesitations, Signs of unrest.\nHawat was deeply troubled by something.\n“Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son,” the Duke said. “It’ll be dawn soon, anyway. l'Il inform your mother.” He got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. “Why don’t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.”\n“I’m not very tired, sir.”\n“As you will.”\nThe Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.\nLike a caged animal, Paul thought.\n“Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?” Paul asked.\nThe Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. “We've discussed the possibility many times.”\n“The old woman seemed so sure of herself,” Paul said. “And the message Mother—”\n“Precautions have been taken,” the Duke said. He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father’s eyes. “Remain here. There are some things about the command posts | want to discuss with Thufir.” He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.\nPaul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman’s warning: “...for the father, nothing.”\nOn that first day when Muad’Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: “Mahdi!” But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al- Gaib.\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three Suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen “H” had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch. “The chairs are liberated but quite safe,” Hawat said. “Where is Paul, Sire?” “I left him in the conference room. I’m hoping he'll get some rest without me there to distract him.” Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of\nstatic and electronic sparking.\n“Thufir,” Leto said, “the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.”\n“M’Lord?”\nThe Duke pursed his lips. “Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.” He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. “Ignore the Emperor’s hoard. He’d secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?”\nHawat shook his head. “We’ve few men to Spare, Sire.”\n“Use some of Idaho’s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime—there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.”\n“As you say, my Lord.” Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I’ve private reports of traitors. Well—best guiet his fears immediately.\n“Thufir,” he said, “since you’re one of the few | can trust completely, there’s another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces...but | have two new reports.”\nHawat turned, stared at him.\nAnd Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.\nInstead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat’s agitation.\nLeto studied the old man and, presently, said: “You've been holding something back, old friend. | Should’ve suspected when you were so nervous during Staff. What ts it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?”\nHawat’s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said: “My Lord, | don’t quite know how to broach this.”\n“We've suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,” the Duke said. “You know you can broach any Subject with me.”\nHawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how | like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?\n“Well?” Leto demanded.\nHawat shrugged. “It’s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We've good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note—it’s a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It’s susceptible to various interpretations.”\n“What’s the delicate content of this note?”\n“Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.”\n“Yes?”\nHawat rubbed at his lips. “It says: ‘...eto will never Suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to destroy him.’ The note was under the Baron’s own seal and I’ve authenticated the seal.”\n“Your suspicion is obvious,” the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.\n“l’d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,” Hawat said. “My Lord, what if...”\n“The Lady Jessica,” Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. “Couldn’t you wring the facts out of this Pardee?”\n“Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier. The courier, I’m certain, did not know what he carried.”\n“ĮI see.”\nLeto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can’t be anything in it. | know my woman.\n“My Lord, tf—”\n“No!” the Duke barked. “There’s a mistake here that—”\n“We cannot ignore it, my Lord.”\n“She’s been with me for sixteen years! There’ve been countless opportunities for—You yourself investigated the school and the woman!”\nHawat spoke bitterly: “Things have been known to escape me.”\n“It’s impossible, | tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides /ine—meaning Paul, too. They’ve already tried once. Could a woman conspire against her own son?”\n“Perhaps she doesn’t conspire against her son. And yesterday’s attempt could’ve been a clever sham.”\n“It couldn’t have been a sham.”\n“Sire, she isn’t supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know? What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?”\n“She'd have moved long before now. Poison in my drink...a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?”\n“The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to kill. There’s a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art among vendettas.”\nThe Duke’s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. /t cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.\n“What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman | love?” he asked.\n“An interpretation I’ve considered,” Hawat said. “Still...”\nThe Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.\n“What do you suggest?” the Duke whispered.\n“For now, constant surveillance, my Lord\n######################\nOutput:",

He’s gifted in diplomacy.”\n“Don’t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.”\n“Of course not, Sire.”\n“And what about Paul?”\n“Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh.”\nLeto turned his back on Hawat. “I leave it in your hands.”\n“I shall use discretion, my Lord.”\nAt least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: “I will take a walk. If you need me, lIl be within the perimeter. The guard can—”\n“My Lord, before you go, I’ve a filmclip you should read. It’s a first-approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You'll recall you asked me to report on it.”\nThe Duke paused, spoke without turning. “Will it not wait?”\n“Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were Shouting, though. It was ‘Mahdi!’ They directed the term at the young master. When they—”\n“At Paul?”\n“Yes, my Lord. They’ve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.”\n“They think Paul is this...this....”\n“They only hope, my Lord.” Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.\nThe Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. “TIl look at it later.”\n“Certainly, my Lord.”\n“Right now, | need time to...think.”\n“Yes, my Lord.”\nThe Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and Stairs and balconies and halls...people who saluted and stood aside for him.\nIn time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard’s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.\n“At ease,” the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.\nA predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the southern horizon, the night’s second moon peered through a thin dust haze—an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.\nAs the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered.\nAnger shot through him.\nThe Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: /\nmust rule with eye and claw—as the hawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.\nTo the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.\nIt was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.\nSome things beggar likeness, he thought.\nHe had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the night’s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet...like giant footsteps.\n“It’s a beautiful morning, Sire,” the guard said.\n“Yes, it is.”\nThe Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.\nThen he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythelike devices—dew gatherers. Water so precious here that even the dew must be collected.\nAnd it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.\nThere is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man—with human flesh.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Duke said: “Paul, I’m doing a hateful thing, but\n| must.” He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing’s sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.\nThe Duke’s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.\nPaul had a viewer in front of him containing a Short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat’s experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.\n“Mahdi!”\n“Lisan al-Gaib!”\nHe could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.\n“A hateful thing,” the Duke said.\n“What do you mean, sir?”\nLeto turned, looked down at his son. “Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. They don’t know that I’d sooner distrust myself.”\n“| don’t understand, sir.”\nAgain, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.\nSlowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.\n“You might just as well mistrust me,” Paul said.\n“They have to think they’ve succeeded,” the Duke said. “They must think me this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham.”\n“But, sir! Why?”\n“Your mother’s response must not be an act. Oh, she’s capable of a supreme act...but too much rides on this. | hope to smoke out a traitor. It must seem that I’ve been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt.”\n“Why do you tell me, Father? Maybe l'Il give it away.”\n“They'll not watch you in this thing,” the Duke said. “You'll keep the secret. You must.” He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. “This way, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the\ntruth—that | never doubted her, not for the smallest instant. | should want her to know this.”\nPaul recognized the death thoughts in his father’s words, spoke quickly: “Nothing’s going to happen to you, sir. The—”\n“Be silent, Son.”\nPaul stared at his father’s back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.\n“You're just tired, Father.”\n“| am tired,” the Duke agreed. “I’m morally tired. The melancholy degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we were such strong people once.”\nPaul spoke in quick anger: “Our House hasn’t degenerated!”\n“Hasn't it?”\nThe Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a cynical twist of mouth. “l should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet...my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters.” He shrugged. “So, I....”\n“Mother has explained this to me.”\n“Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura,” the Duke said. “I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.”\n“You lead well,” Paul protested. “You govern well. Men follow you willingly and love you.”\n“My propaganda corps is one of the finest,” the Duke said. Again, he turned to stare out at the basin. “There’s greater possibility for us here on Arrakis\nthan the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes | think it'd have been better if we’d run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes | wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people, become less exposed LOR.\n“Father!”\n“Yes, | am tired,” the Duke said. “Did you know we're using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?”\n“Sire”\n“We mustn’t run short of filmbase,” the Duke said. “Else, how could we flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how well | govern them. How would they know if we didn’t tell them?”\n“You should get some rest,” Paul said.\nAgain, the Duke faced his son. “Arrakis has another advantage | almost forgot to mention. Spice IS in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in almost everything. And | find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common poisons of the Assassins’ Handbook. And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food production—yeast culture, hydroponics, chemavit, everything—under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large segments of our population with poison—and we cannot be attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.”\nPaul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: “I have to have someone | can say these things to, Son.” He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now—\ntrampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.\n“On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,” the Duke said. “Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House—running, hunted.”\nPaul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.\n“To hold Arrakis,” the Duke said, “one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect.” He pointed out the window to the\n######################\nOutput:",

Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.”\nPaul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: “I have to have someone | can say these things to, Son.” He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now—\ntrampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.\n“On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,” the Duke said. “Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House—running, hunted.”\nPaul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.\n“To hold Arrakis,” the Duke said, “one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect.” He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. “That honorable banner could come to mean many evil things.”\nPaul swallowed in a dry throat. His father’s words carried futility, a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.\nThe Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. “Power and fear,” he said. “The tools of Statecraft. | must order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you. That filmclip there—they call you ‘Mahdi’—‘Lisan al-Gaib’—as a last resort, you might capitalize on that.”\nPaul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.\n“What’s keeping that ecologist?” the Duke muttered. “I told Thufir to have him here early.”\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and | sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. | marked the strong resemblance between them—my father and this man in the portrait—both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. “Princess-daughter,” my father said, “l would that you’d been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.” My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and | was but 14, yet | remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nH is first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr. Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitted the ancient prophecy so precisely. He had “the questing eyes,” and the air of “reserved candor.”\nOf course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene. Still, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.\nThey met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field’s administration building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and the faint air- distortion of a shield around him.\nKynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for them there!\nThe planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back. He strode on ahead toward the building’s entrance—the dark hole in plastic- coated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less suitable than a cave.\nMovement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.\nThe entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them heavily armed—slow- pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them came a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a free-swinging, striding rhythm.\nBeside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the face. The youth seemed Small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others. And he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with\ncasual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing.\n“The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see,” went the prophecy.\nKynes shook his head, telling himself: They’re just people.\nWith the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized—Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.\n“You may Call the Duke ‘my Lord’ or ‘Sire.’ ‘Noble Born’ also ts correct, but usually reserved for more formal occasions. The son may be addressed as ‘young Master’ or ‘my Lord.’ The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks little familiarity.\nAnd Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They'll learn soon enough who’s master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that Mentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do they?\nThe import of Hawat’s questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the Imperial bases. And it was obvious they’d learned of the bases from Idaho.\n| will have Stilgar send Idaho’s head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.\nThe ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots crunching the sand.\nKynes bowed. “My Lord, Duke.”\nAs he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit, and low\nboots. The man’s hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side, revealing long sandy hair, a Sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless blue- within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets.\n“You're the ecologist,” the Duke said.\n“We prefer the old title here, my Lord,” Kynes said. “Planetologist.”\n“As you wish,” the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. “Son, this is the Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.” He glanced at Kynes. “And this is my son.”\n“My Lord,” Kynes said.\n“Are you a Fremen?” Paul asked.\nKynes smiled. “I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But | am in His Majesty’s service, the Imperial Planetologist.”\nPaul nodded, impressed by the man’s air of strength. Halleck had pointed Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: “The man standing there with the Fremen escort—the one moving now toward the ornithopter.”\nPaul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul’s ear: “Odd sort of fellow. Has a precise way of speaking—clipped off, no fuzzy edges—razor-apt.”\nAnd the Duke, behind them, had said: “Scientist type.”\nNow, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the impact of personality, as\nthough he were blood royal, born to command.\n“I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,” the Duke said.\n“I hope they fit well, my Lord,” Kynes said. “They're of Fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.”\n“I was concerned that you said you couldn’t take us into the desert unless we wore these garments,” the Duke said. “We can carry plenty of water. We don’t intend to be out long and we'll have air cover— the escort you see overhead right now. It isn’t likely we'd be forced down.”\nKynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: “You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.”\nHalleck stiffened. “The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!”\nLeto gave Halleck their private hand signal to desist, said: “Our ways are new here, Gurney. We must make allowances.”\n“As you wish, Sire.”\n“We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes,” Leto said. “These suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered.”\nOn impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said: “‘The gift is the blessing of the giver.’”\nThe words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: “Lisan al-Gaib!”\nKynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the building.\n“Most interesting,” Leto said.\nKynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: “Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They mean no harm.” But he thought of the words of the legend: “They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing.”\nLeto’s assessment of Kynes—based partly on Hawat’s brief verbal report (guarded and full of Suspicions)—suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas—but it had seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul’s question had been direct and pertinent.\nKynes had gone native.\n“Shouldn’t we be going, Sire?” Halleck asked.\nThe Duke nodded. “I'll fly my own ‘thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.”\n“One moment, please,” Kynes said. “With your permission, Sire, | must check the security of your Suits.”\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: “I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours...\nmy Lord. I’m well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care.”\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet...to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?\nThe thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. “We're in your hands,” the Duke\n######################\nOutput:",

Do | hold the Same course?”\n“The same course,” Kynes muttered.\nPaul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged Shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Paul couldn’t be sure.\n“Are there any plants down there?” Paul asked.\n“Some,” Kynes said. “This latitude’s life-zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers—adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate that life or you die.”\n“You mean steal water from each other?” Paul asked. The idea outraged him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.\n“It’s done,” Kynes said, “but that wasn’t precisely my meaning. You see, my climate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.”\nAnd the Duke thought: “...my climate!”\n“Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord,” Kynes said. “There’s a blow coming up from the west.”\nThe Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked the ‘thopter around, noting the way the escort’s wings reflected milky orange from the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.\n“This should clear the storm’s edge,” Kynes said.\n“That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it,” Paul said. “Will it really cut the strongest metals?”\n“At this altitude, it’s not sand but dust,” Kynes said. “The danger is lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.”\n“We'll see actual spice mining today?” Paul asked.\n“Very likely,” Kynes said.\nPaul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his mother called “registering” the person. He had Kynes now—tone of voice, each detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the man’s robe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged strangely. It was Said that desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked small necessities. Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash—certainly not from a concealed shield belt. A copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes’ robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.\nHalleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear compartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck tuned the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.\n“What would you like to hear, young Master?” Halleck asked.\n“You choose, Gurney,” Paul said.\nHalleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang softly:\n“Our fathers ate manna in the desert,\nIn the burning places where whirlwinds came. Lord, save us from that horrible land!\nSave us...oh-h-h-h, save us\nFrom the dry and thirsty land.”\nKynes glanced at the Duke, said: “You do travel with a light complement of guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?”\n“Gurney?” The Duke chuckled. “Gurney’s one of a kind. | like him with me for his eyes. His eyes miss very little.”\nThe planetologist frowned.\nWithout missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:\n“For I am like an owl of the desert, o! Aiyah! am like an owl of the des-ert!”\nThe Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel, thumbed it to life, said: “Leader to Escort Gemma. Flying object at nine o'clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?”\n“It’s merely a bird,” Kynes said, and added: “You have sharp eyes.”\nThe panel speaker crackled, then: “Escort Gemma. Object examined under full amplification. It’s a large bird.”\nPaul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of intermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be. Every sense was at full alert.\n“I'd not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,” the Duke said.\n“That’s likely an eagle,” Kynes said. “Many creatures have adapted to this place.”\nThe ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their two thousand meters’ altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and escort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.\n“Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?” the Duke asked.\nHalleck’s music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.\n“Not from the deep desert,” Kynes said. “Men have walked out of the second zone several times. They’ve survived by crossing the rock areas where worms seldom go.”\nThe timbre of Kynes’ voice held Paul’s attention. He felt his sense come alert the way they were trained to do.\n“Ah-h, the worms,” the Duke said. “I must see one sometime.”\n“You may see one today,” Kynes said. “Wherever there is spice, there are worms.”\n“Always?” Halleck asked.\n“Always.”\n“Is there a relationship between worm and spice?” the Duke asked.\nKynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. “They defend spice sands. Each worm has a—territory. As to the spice...who knows? Worm specimens we’ve examined lead us to suspect\ncomplicated chemical interchanges within them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated acid forms elsewhere. l'Il give you my monograph on the subject.”\n“And a shield’s no defense?” the Duke asked.\n“Shields!” Kynes sneered. “Activate a shield within the worm zone and you seal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to attack a shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.”\n“How are worms taken, then?”\n“High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm,” Kynes said. “They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of its own. Barring atomics, | know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They’re incredibly tough.”\n“Why hasn't an effort been made to wipe them out?” Paul asked.\n“Too expensive,” Kynes said. “Too much area to cover.”\nPaul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings, told him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he thought: /f there’s a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.\n“No one will have to walk out of the desert soon,” the Duke said. “Trip these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our workers will be\nwearing them before long. We're setting up a special rescue service.”\n“Very commendable,” Kynes said.\n“Your tone says you don’t agree,” the Duke said.\n“Agree? Of course | agree, but it won’t be much use. Static electricity from sandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They’ve been tried here before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm’s hunting you there’s not much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty minutes.”\n“What would you advise?” the Duke asked.\n“You ask my advice?”\n“AS planetologist, yes.”\n“You'd follow my advice?”\n“If | found it sensible.”\n“Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone.”\nThe Duke turned his attention from the controls. “That’s all?”\n“That’s all. Never travel alone.”\n“What if you’re separated by a storm and forced down?” Halleck asked. “Isn’t there anything you could do?”\n“Anything covers much territory,” Kynes said.\n“What would you do?” Paul asked.\nKynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the Duke. “I’d remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If | were outside the worm zone or in rock, I’d stay with the ship. If | were down in open sand, l’d get away from the ship as fast as | could. About a thousand meters would be far enough.\nThen I’d hide beneath my robe. A worm would get the ship, but it might miss me.”\n“Then what?” Halleck asked.\nKynes shrugged. “Wait for the worm to leave.”\n“That’s all?” Paul asked.\n“When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out,” Kynes said. “You must walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins—head for the nearest rock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it.”\n“Drum sand?” Halleck asked.\n“A condition of sand compaction,” Kynes said. “The slightest step sets it drumming. Worms always come to that.”\n“And a tidal dust basin?” the Duke asked.\n“Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries. Some are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary who step into them.”\nHalleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:\n“Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there, Waiting for the innocents to pass. Oh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert, Lest you seek a lonely epitaph.\nThe perils of the—”\nHe broke off, leaned forward. “Dust cloud ahead, Sire.”\n“I see it, Gurney.”\n“That’s what we seek,” Kynes said.\nPaul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.\n“One of your factory crawlers,” Kynes said. “It’s on the surface and that means it’s on spice. The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed. There’s no other cloud quite like it.”\n“Aircraft over it,” the Duke said.\n“| see two...three...four spotters,” Kynes said. “They're watching for wormsign.”\n“Wormsign?” the Duke asked.\n“A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They'll have seismic probes on the surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show.” Kynes swung his gaze around the sky. “Should be a Carryall wing around, but | don’t see it.”\n“The worm always comes, eh?” Halleck asked.\n“Always.”\nPaul leaned forward, touched Kynes’ shoulder. “How big an area does each worm stake out?”\nKynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions.\n“That depends on the size of the worm.”\n“What’s the variation?” the Duke asked.\n“Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones—” He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft became a full ’thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle\nbeat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler.\n“Is that wormsign?”\nKynes leaned across the Duke to peer\n######################\nOutput:",

The craft became a full ’thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle\nbeat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler.\n“Is that wormsign?”\nKynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.\nPaul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged ahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some three kilometers away.\nWhere the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into the distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion—a cresting of sand. It reminded Paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface.\n“Worm,” Kynes said. “Big one.” He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from the panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the grid chart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: “Calling crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge, please.” He waited.\nThe panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: “Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over.”\n“They seem pretty calm about it,” Halleck said.\nKynes spoke into the microphone: “Unlisted flight —north and east of you about three kilometers. Wormsign Is on intercept course, your position, estimated contact twenty-five minutes.”\nAnother voice rumbled from the speaker: “This is Spotter Control. Sighting confirmed. Stand by for contact fix.” There was a pause, then: “Contact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who’s on that unlisted flight? Over.”\nHalleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke. “Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?”\n“Yes. Why?”\n“Who'd be listening?”\n“Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference.”\nAgain, the speaker crackled, then: “This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus credit for that spot? Over.”\nHalleck glanced at the Duke.\nKynes said: “There’s a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning. They want to know—”\n“Tell them who had first sight of that worm,” Halleck said.\nThe Duke nodded.\nKynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone: “Spotter credit to the Duke Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.”\nThe voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static: “We read and thank you.”\n“Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,” Halleck ordered. “Tell them it’s the Duke’s wish.”\nKynes took a deep breath, then: “It’s the Duke’s wish that you divide the bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.”\n“Acknowledged and thank you,” the speaker said.\nThe Duke said: “I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in public relations.”\nKynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.\n“This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety,” Halleck said. “Word will get around. It was on an area working frequency—not likely Harkonnen agents heard.” He glanced out at their air cover. “And we're a pretty strong force. It was a good risk.”\nThe Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler. “What happens now?”\n“There’s a carryall wing somewhere close,” Kynes said. “It’ll come in and lift off the crawler.”\n“What if the carryall’s wrecked?” Halleck asked.\n“Some equipment /s lost,” Kynes said. “Get in close over the crawler, my Lord; you'll find this interesting.”\nThe Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler.\nPaul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it.\n“Rich spice bed by the color,” Kynes said. “They'll continue working until the last minute.”\nThe Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent as he settled lower ina circling glide above the crawler. A glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.\nPaul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler’s pipe vents, looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.\n“Shouldn’t we be hearing them call in the carryall?” Halleck asked.\n“They usually have the wing on a different frequency,” Kynes said.\n“Shouldn’t they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?” the Duke asked. “There should be twenty-six men on that machine down there, not to mention cost of equipment.”\nKynes said: “You don’t have enough ex—”\nHe broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: “Any of you see the wing? He isn’t answering.”\nA garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override signal, then silence and the first voice: “Report by the numbers! Over.”\n“This is Spotter Control. Last | saw, the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest. | don’t see him now. Over.”\n“Spotter one: negative. Over.”\n“Spotter two: negative. Over.”\n“Spotter three: negative. Over.”\nSilence.\nThe Duke looked down. His own craft’s shadow was just passing over the crawler. “Only four spotters, is that right?”\n“Correct,” Kynes said.\n“There are five in our party,” the Duke said. “Our Ships are larger. We can crowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two each.”\nPaul did the mental arithmetic, said: “That’s three Short.”\n“Why don’t they have two carryalls to each crawler?” barked the Duke.\n“You don’t have enough extra equipment,” Kynes said.\n“All the more reason we should protect what we have!”\n“Where could that carryall go?” Halleck asked.\n“Could’ve been forced down somewhere out of sight,” Kynes said.\nThe Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its switch. “How could they lose sight of a carryall?”\n“They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign,” Kynes said.\nThe Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. “This is your Duke. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner’s crew. All spotters are ordered to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the west. Over.” He reached down, punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.\nKynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the speaker: “...almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We can’t leave that for a damned worm! Over.”\n“Damn the spice!” the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone, said: “We can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who’s to go. But you’re going, and that’s an order!” He Slammed the microphone back into Kynes’ hands, muttered: “Sorry,” as Kynes shook an injured finger.\n“How much time?” Paul asked.\n“Nine minutes,” Kynes said.\nThe Duke said: “This ship has more power than the others. If we took off under jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man.”\n“That sand’s soft,” Kynes said.\n“With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings, Sire,” Halleck said.\n“Not on this ship,” the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the ’thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the ‘thopter to a Skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.\nThe crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his door.\nImmediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon—heavy and pungent.\nWith a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler.\nThe Duke’s own escort swooped in to land in line with him.\nPaul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the ‘thopters were dwarfed by it—gnats beside a warrior beetle.\n“Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,” the Duke said. He manually cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod controls. “Why the devil aren’t they coming out of that machine?”\n“They're hoping the carryall will show up,” Kynes said. “They still have a few minutes.” He glanced off to the east.\nAll turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.\nThe Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: “Two of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry one more man that way. We're not leaving any men for that monster.” He keyed back to the working frequency, barked: “All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from your Duke! On the double or l'Il cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!”\nA hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear, another at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped down to a track and then to the sand.\nThe Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: “Two men\neach into your spotters.”\nThe man in the patched robe began tolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side.\n“Four over here!” the Duke shouted. “Four into that ship back there!” He jabbed a finger at an escort ‘thopter directly behind him. The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. “And four into that ship over there!” He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. “Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!”\nThe tall man finished counting off his crew, came Slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions.\n“I hear the worm, but | can’t see it,” Kynes said.\nThe others heard it then—an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.\n“Damn sloppy way to operate,” the Duke muttered.\nAircraft\n######################\nOutput:",

The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. “And four into that ship over there!” He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. “Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!”\nThe tall man finished counting off his crew, came Slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions.\n“I hear the worm, but | can’t see it,” Kynes said.\nThe others heard it then—an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.\n“Damn sloppy way to operate,” the Duke muttered.\nAircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planet’s jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild OX.\nThe spice workers slogged up to the side of the ‘thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.\n“In you go, boys!” he snapped. “On the double!”\nPaul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action.\nHis father would have to order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn’t watch such things.\nThe last man came gasping into the rear, said, “The worm! It’s almost on us! Blast off!”\nThe Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: “We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?” He shut his door, checked it.\n“Almost exactly, my Lord,” Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this Duke.\n“All secure here, Sire,” Halleck said.\nThe Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.\nThe takeoff pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls— gently, surely. The ‘thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.\n“She's very heavy, Sire,” Halleck said.\n“Well within the tolerances of this ship,” the Duke said. “You didn’t really think I’d risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?”\nHalleck grinned, said: “Not a bit of it, Sire.”\nThe Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve— climbing over the crawler.\nPaul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters\nfrom the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.\n“The worm is now beneath the crawler,” Kynes said. “You are about to witness a thing few have seen.”\nFlecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.\nThen they saw it!\nA wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it. The hole’s diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine Slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.\n“Gods, what a monster!” muttered a man beside Paul.\n“Got all our floggin’ spice!” growled another.\n“Someone is going to pay for this,” the Duke said. “| promise you that.”\nBy the very flatness of his father’s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste!\nIn the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.\n“Bless the Maker and His water,” Kynes murmured. “Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people.”\n“What’s that you’re saying?” the Duke asked.\nBut Kynes remained silent.\nPaul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes’ head. One of them whispered: “Liet.”\nKynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.\nAnother of the rescued men began coughing—dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: “Curse this hell hole!”\nThe tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said: “Be you still, Coss. You but worsen your cough.” He stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the Duke’s head. “You be the Duke Leto, | warrant,” he said. “It’s to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.”\n“Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,” Halleck muttered.\nPaul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his father’s jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.\nLeto began easing his ‘thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.\n“Who’s that down there?” the Duke barked.\n“Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,” said the tall Dune man.\n“Why wasn’t something said about them?”\n“It was the chance they took, Soor,” the Dune man said.\n“My Lord,” said Kynes, “these men know it’s of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.”\n“We'll send a ship from base for them!” the Duke Snapped.\n“As you wish, my Lord,” Kynes said. “But likely when the ship gets here there'll be no one to rescue.”\n“We'll send a ship, anyway,” the Duke said.\n“They were right beside where the worm came up,” Paul said. “How’d they escape?”\n“The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,” Kynes said.\n“You waste fuel here, Sire,” Halleck ventured.\n“Aye, Gurney.”\nThe Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.\nPaul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so Surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.\nFremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course—because they are in no danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!\n“What were Fremen doing on that crawler?” Paul asked.\nKynes whirled.\nThe tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul—blue within blue within blue. “Who be this lad?” he asked.\nHalleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: “This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.”\n“Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?” the man asked.\n“They fit the description,” Paul said.\nKynes snorted. “You can’t tell Fremen just by looking at them!” He looked at the Dune man. “You. Who were those men?”\n“Friends of one of the others,” the Dune man said. “Just friends from a village who wanted to see the Spice sands.”\nKynes turned away. “Fremen!”\nBut he was remembering the words of the legend: “The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge.”\n“They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,” the Dune man said. “We should not speak unkindly on them.”\nBut Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.\nPaul spoke dryly: “A terrible place for them to die.”\nWithout turning, Kynes said: “When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature’s wants to direct him to that place.”\nLeto turned a hard stare at Kynes.\nAnd Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over\nthe spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men’s lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.\nAgainst his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: / like this Duke.\nGreatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| n the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bull’s head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke.\nBeneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table—little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison snooper had been concealed.\nPausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison Snooper and what it signified in his society.\nAll of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language—the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone try chaumurky tonight—poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas—poison in the food?\nHe shook his head.\nBeside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.\nFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of\n######################\nOutput:",

There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.\nFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.\nHow typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach.\n“The custom stops here!” he muttered.\nHe saw a serving woman—one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended— hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She\nmoved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue- within-blue eyes.\n“My Lord wishes?” She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.\nHe gestured. “Have these basins and towels removed.”\n“But...Noble Born....” She looked up, mouth gaping.\n“I know the custom!” he barked. “Take these basins to the front door. While we’re eating and until we've finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water. Understood?”\nHer leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger....\nWith sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.\nHis face clouded, and he growled: “I’m posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter.”\nHe whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water and waves—days of grass instead of sand —dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves.\nAll gone.\nI’m getting old, he thought. /’ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman’s greed.\nIn the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard- faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various Smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.\nMost of the women in the hall seemed cast from a Specific type—decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.\nEven without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors—a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.\nHe realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades —that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.\nNearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat— “Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance.”\nThe Duke glanced around the room.\nThere was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.\nHe’ll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.\nPaul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts—voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast.\n/’m in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.\nHe knew his mood’s source. He hadn’t wanted to attend this function, but his father had been firm. “You have a place—a position to uphold. You're old enough to do this. You’re almost a man.”\nPaul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.\nAs Leto approached Jessica’s group, the water- shipper was asking: “Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?”\nFrom behind the man, the Duke said: “We haven’t gone that far in our thinking, sir.”\nThe man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. “Ah-h, the Duke,” he said. “We missed you.”\nLeto glanced at Jessica. “A thing needed doing.” He returned his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: “As far as I’m concerned, the old custom ends now.”\n“Is this a ducal order, m’Lord?” the man asked.\n“| leave that to your own...ah...conscience,” the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.\nOne of the women said: “I think it’s a very generous gesture—giving water to the—” Someone shushed her.\nThe Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.\nThe water-shipper asked in an angry voice: “Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?”\n“This custom has been changed,” Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica’s face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it'll increase rumors of friction between us.\n“With the Duke’s permission,” the water-shipper said, “I'd like to inquire further about customs.”\nLeto heard the sudden oily tone in the man’s voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room.\n“Isn’t it almost time for dinner?” Jessica asked.\n“But our guest has some questions,” Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round- faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling Hawat’s memorandum: “...and this water-shipper Is a man to watch—Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him.”\n“Water customs are so interesting,” Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face. “I’m curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people’s faces...m’Lord?”\nLeto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewt’s signature over a contract of allegiance. The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal.... The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.\n“My Lord, the Duke, and | have other plans for our conservatory,” Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. “We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.”\nBless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.\n“Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,” the Duke said. “I’d advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.”\nAnd he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt’s organization. And we must start on standby water facilities at once. No man Is going to hold a club over my head!\nBewt nodded, the smile still on his face. “A commendable dream, my Lord.” He withdrew a pace.\nLeto’s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes’ face. The man was Staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured—like a man in love...or caught in a religious trance.\nKynes’ thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: “And they shall share your most precious dream.” He spoke directly to Jessica: “Do you bring the shortening of the way?”\n“Ah, Dr. Kynes,” the water-shipper said. “You’ve come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.”\nKynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: “It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.”\n“They have many strange sayings in the desert,” Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.\nJessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: “...the shortening of the way.” In the old\ntongue, the phrase translated as “Kwisatz Haderach.” The planetologist’s odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.\nKwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: “Many people have sought to change Arrakis.”\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served,\n######################\nOutput:",

Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.\nThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: “Many people have sought to change Arrakis.”\nThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\nInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served, my Lord.”\nThe Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.\n“The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,” she said, and smiled: “Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?”\nHe spoke coldly: “That seems a goodly custom. We Shall let it stand for now.”\nThe illusion that | suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?\nJessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. /s it\nbecause | moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.\nLeto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: “Sire! | forbid it!”\nA grim smile touched the Duke’s mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head. “I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,” he’d said. “Things move too swiftly on Arrakis. That’s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.”\nPaul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.\n“Her father manufactures stillsuits,” Jessica said. “I'm told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man’s suits.”\n“Who’s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?” the Duke asked. “I don’t place him.”\n“A late addition to the list,” she whispered. “Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.”\n“Gurney arranged?”\n“At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler’s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He’s a\npower among his kind. They all know him here. He’s dined at many of the houses.”\n“Why is he here?”\n“Everyone here will ask that question,” she said. “Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He'll also serve notice that you’re prepared to back up your orders against graft—by enforcement from the smugglers’ end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.”\n“l'm not sure / like it.” He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. “Why didn’t you invite some Fremen?”\n“There’s Kynes,” she said.\n“Yes, there’s Kynes,” he said. “Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?” He led her into step behind the procession.\n“All else is most conventional,” she said.\nAnd she thought: My darling, can’t you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.\nAs they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.\nUneasy silence settled over the room.\nJessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto’s mouth,\nnoted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.\n“Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,” Leto said. “This is my way of telling you that many things will change.”\nEmbarrassed silence settled over the table.\nThey think him drunk, Jessica thought.\nLeto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot beams of reflection off it. “As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,” he said, “I give you a toast.”\nThe others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a Ssuspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke’s hawk features.\n“Here I am and here | remain!” he barked.\nThere was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths—stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. “My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: ‘Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!’”\nHe sipped his water.\nThe others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.\n“Gurney!” the Duke called.\nFrom an alcove at Leto’s end of the room came Halleck’s voice. “Here, my Lord.”\n“Give us a tune, Gurney.”\nA minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the\ntable at the Duke’s gesture releasing them—roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-ole served with sparkling Caladan wine.\nStill, the Duke remained standing.\nAs the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: “In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.” His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. “I cannot sing, but | give you the words of Gurney’s song. Consider it another toast—a toast to all who’ve died bringing us to this station.”\nAn uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.\nJessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her—there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle- faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuek, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.\n“Review, friends—troops long past review,” the Duke intoned. “All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review, friends—troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends—troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we’ll pass the lure of fortune.”\nThe Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, Slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen.\nThe others drank in embarrassed silence.\nAgain, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.\nJessica was first to follow his example.\nThere was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests’ actions revealed—especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions, nervous laughter...and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.\nKynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetologist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.\nHalleck’s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.\n“Let the dinner commence,” the Duke said, and sank into his chair.\nHe’s angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.\nSlowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way. The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.\n“We brought both from Caladan,” she said. “Superb!” he said, tasting the chukka. “Simply superb! And not a hint of melange in it. One gets so\ntired of the spice in everything.”\nThe Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. “I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.”\n“News travels fast,” the Duke said.\n“Then it’s true?” the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.\n“Of course, it’s true!” the Duke snapped. “The blasted carryall disappeared. It shouldn’t be possible for anything that big to disappear!”\n“When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,” Kynes said.\n“It should not be possible!” the Duke repeated.\n“No one saw the carryall leave?” the banker asked.\n“Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,” Kynes said. “They’re primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall’s complement usually is four\nmen—two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one—or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke’s foes—”\n“Ah-h-h, | see,” the banker said. “And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?”\n“I shall have to consider my position carefully,” Kynes said, “and | certainly will not discuss it at table.” And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this ts the kind of infraction | was instructed to ignore.\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy- faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern\n######################\nOutput:",

He knows this ts the kind of infraction | was instructed to ignore.\nThe banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.\nJessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy- faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.\nA thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.\nNow, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents. That Is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to separate this element for your analysis—in the beginning, through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by close observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You will find it\nfairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.\nNow, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern—subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.\nDoes this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself. /t’s his pattern.\nThe banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.\n“I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,” the banker said, directing his words at Jessica. “All of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers.”\nThe stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, seated between Paul and his father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: “Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.”\nThe banker smiled. “They call me Soo-Soo because I’m financial adviser to the Water Peddlers Union.” And, as Jessica continued to look at him without comment, he added: “Because of the water- sellers’ cry—‘Soo-Soo Sook!’” And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.\nJessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cue—a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had said: “/, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis—water.”\nPaul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion’s voice, saw that his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the banker.\n“Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?”\n“That’s an odd question, young Master,” the banker said. “I merely said the birds drink blood. It doesn’t have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?”\n“It was not an odd question,” Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. “Most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind.” He deliberately forked a bite of food from his\ncompanion’s plate, ate it. “They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.”\nThe banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.\n“Do not make the error of considering my son a child,” the Duke said. And he smiled.\nJessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.\n“It’s a rule of ecology,” Kynes said, “that the young Master appears to understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood’s an efficient energy source.”\nThe banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: “It’s said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.”\nKynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: “Not the blood, sir. But all of a man’s water, ultimately, belongs to his people—to his tribe. It’s a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water’s precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.”\nThe banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.\nKynes looked at Jessica. “Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying.”\n“You’ve associated so long with Fremen that you've lost all sensibilities,” the banker rasped.\nKynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. “Are you challenging me, sir?”\nThe banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: “Of course not. I’d not so insult our host and hostess.”\nJessica heard the fear in the man’s voice, saw it in his face, in his breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!\n“Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when they’ve been insulted, Kynes said. “They’re brave people who understand defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here...now...on Arrakis.”\nJessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker’s discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.\n“Well?” Kynes said.\n“I meant no offense,” the banker muttered. “If offense was taken, please accept my apologies.”\n“Freely given, freely accepted,” Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.\nJessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes’ assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.\nLeto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The ecologist’s manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.\nJessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared with /angues de lapins de garenne—red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side.\nSlowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would have killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes’ manner. He was a casual killer, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.\nJessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: “I find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.”\n“Very important,” he agreed. “What is this dish? It’s delicious.”\n“Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,” she said. “A very old recipe.”\n“I must have that recipe,” the man said.\nShe nodded. “I'll see that you get it.”\nKynes looked at Jessica, said: “The newcomer to Arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum.”\nShe heard the testing quality in his voice, said, “Growth is limited by that necessity which is present\nin the least amount. And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.”\n“It’s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems,” Kynes said. “Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care.”\nJessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes’ words, but knew she was missing it. “Growth,” she said. “Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?”\n“Impossible!” the water magnate barked.\nJessica turned her attention to Bewt. “Impossible?”\n“Impossible on Arrakis,” he said. “Don’t listen to this dreamer. All the laboratory evidence is against him.”\nKynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.\n“Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,” Kynes said. “That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.”\n“Normal!” Bewt snorted. “Nothing about Arrakis is normal!”\n“Quite the contrary,” Kynes said. “Certain harmonies could be set up here along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it.”\n“It'll never be done,” Bewt said.\nThe Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes’ attitude had changed—it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.\n“What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?” Leto asked.\n“If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we’ve started the cyclic system,” Kynes said.\n“Water’s the only problem?” the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes’ excitement, felt himself caught up in it.\n“Water overshadows the other problems,” Kynes said. “This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants—widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.”\n“Do you have pilot projects?” the Duke asked. “We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect—small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its\nworking facts,” Kynes said.\n“There isn’t enough water,” Bewt said. “There just isn’t enough water.”\n“Master Bewt is an expert on water,” Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! | want an answer! Is there\n######################\nOutput:",

He smiled, turned back to his dinner.\nThe Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! | want an answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?”\nKynes stared at his plate.\nJessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.\n“Is there enough water!” the Duke demanded.\n“There...may be,” Kynes said.\nHe’s faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.\nWith his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But Kynes doesn’t wish it to be known.\n“Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,” Bewt said. “He dreams with the Fremen—of prophecies and messiahs.”\nChuckles sounded at odd places around the table. Jessica marked them—the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.\nTensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There’s too much going on of which I’m not aware. l'Il have to develop new information sources.\nThe Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let down, as though something vital had passed him here. “Maybe,” he muttered.\nKynes spoke quickly: “Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord. There are so many—”\nThe planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke’s side. The man bent, whispering into Leto’s ear.\nJessica recognized the capsign of Hawat’s corps, fought down uneasiness. She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer’s feminine companion—a\ntiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.\n“You've hardly touched your dinner, my dear,” Jessica said. “May | order you something?”\nThe woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: “I’m not very hungry.”\nAbruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of command: “Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention.” He Stepped aside. “Paul, take over as host for me, if you please.”\nPaul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father’s chair, sat down in tt.\nThe Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: “Gurney, please take Paul’s place at table. We mustn’t have an odd number here. When the dinner’s over, | may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call.”\nHalleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.\n“There’s no need for alarm,” the Duke said, “but | must ask that no one leave until our house guard says It’s safe. You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and we'll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.”\nPaul caught the code words in his father’s message— guard-safe-secure-shortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read the same message. They both relaxed.\nThe Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper.\nPaul said: “Please go on with your dinner. | believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water.”\n“May we discuss it another time?” Kynes asked.\n“By all means,” Paul said.\nAnd Jessica noted with pride her son’s dignity, the mature sense of assurance.\nThe banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. “None of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps you’ve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like aman.”\nJessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a hand signal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard.\nBewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.\nPaul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards, looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: “Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He—”\n“Drowned?” It was the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter.\nPaul hesitated, then: “Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.”\n“What an interesting way to die,” she murmured.\nPaul’s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. “The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders—made by another fisherman’s claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat—a craft for traveling on water—that foundered...sank beneath the water. Another fisherman helping recover the body said he’d seen marks like this man’s wounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellow’s shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface—to reach air.”\n“Why is this interesting?” the banker asked.\n“Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable— except when you see it happen in the drawing room.” Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: “And, | should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.”\nA sudden stillness enfolded the room.\nThat was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The house troopers were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.\n“Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!” It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with complete abandon.\nNervous smiles appeared around the table.\nBewt was grinning.\nThe banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.\nKynes said: “One baits an Atreides at his own risk.”\n“Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?” the banker demanded.\nBefore Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: “Sir!” And she thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature’s game. Is he here to try for Paul? Does he have help?\n“My son displays a general garment and you claim it’s cut to your fit?” Jessica asked. “What a fascinating revelation.” She slid a hand down to her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.\nThe banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had focused on the code word: garment. “Prepare for violence.”\nKynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek.\nThe smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. “FII give you a toast,” he said. “To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his actions.”\nWhy do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.\nThe banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent’s face.\nPeople began responding all around the table.\nWhere Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides with Paul. What’s the secret of his power? It can’t be because he’s Judge of the\nChange. That’s temporary. And certainly not because he’s a civil servant.\nShe removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind.\nOnly Paul and the banker—(Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica thought.)—remained empty- handed. The banker’s attention stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate.\n| was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.\nHalleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him: “In our society, people shouldn't be quick to take offense. It’s frequently suicidal.” He looked at the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter beside him. “Don’t you think so, miss?”\n“Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed | do,” she said. “There’s too much violence. It makes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It doesn’t make sense.”\n“Indeed it doesn’t,” Halleck said.\nJessica saw the near perfection of the girl’s act, realized: That empty-headed little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been the first to see it—his training hadn’t overlooked that obvious gambit.\nKynes spoke to the banker: “Isn't another apology in order?”\nThe banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: “My Lady, | fear I’ve overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I’m not accustomed to it.”\nJessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: “When strangers meet, great allowance Should be made for differences of custom and training.”\n“Thank you, my Lady,” he said.\nThe dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward Jessica, said: “The Duke spoke of our being secure here. | do hope that doesn’t mean more fighting.”\nShe was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.\n“Likely this will prove unimportant,” Jessica said. “But there’s so much detail requiring the Duke’s personal attention in these times. As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.” She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. “And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.” She shifted her attention to Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”\n“Indeed it is,” Kynes said.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: “I do believe I'll eat something now. I’d like some of that bird dish you served earlier.”\nJessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were speaking\n######################\nOutput:",

He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.” She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. “And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.” She shifted her attention to Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”\n“Indeed it is,” Kynes said.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: “I do believe I'll eat something now. I’d like some of that bird dish you served earlier.”\nJessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits. | find so many interesting things about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into the desert?”\n“Oh, no, my Lady,” he said. “Very little’s known of the deep desert. And almost nothing of the southern regions.”\n“There’s a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the southern reaches,” Kynes said, “but | suspect it was an imaginative invention made solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters do, on occasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that’s extremely dangerous— navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn’t been found profitable to venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather satellite....”\nBewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: “It’s said the Fremen travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells even in the southern latitudes.”\n“Soaks and sip-wells?” Jessica asked.\nKynes spoke quickly: “Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other planets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs. A sip-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw...so it is said.”\nThere’s deception in his words, Jessica thought.\nWhy is he lying? Paul wondered.\n“How very interesting,” Jessica said. And she thought: “/t is said....” What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions.\n“I’ve heard you have a saying,” Paul said, “that polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert.”\n“There are many sayings on Arrakis,” Kynes said.\nBefore Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a note. She opened it, saw the Duke’s handwriting and code signs, scanned it.\n“You'll all be delighted to know,” she said, “that our Duke sends his reassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The missing carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers’ base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.” She nodded to Tuek.\nThe smuggler nodded back.\nJessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.\n“l'm glad it didn’t come to open battle,” the banker said. “The people have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.”\n“Especially prosperity,” Bewt said.\n“Shall we have our dessert now?” Jessica asked. “I’ve had our chef prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.”\n“It sounds wonderful,” the stillsuit manufacturer said. “Would it be possible to get the recipe?”\n“Any recipe you desire,” Jessica said, registering the man for later mention to Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be\nbought.\nSmall talk resumed around her: “Such a lovely fabric....” “He is having a setting made to match the jewel....” “We might try for a production increase next quarter....”\nJessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto’s message: The Harkonnens tried to get ina shipment of lasguns. We captured them. This may mean they’ve succeeded with other shipments. It certainly means they don’t place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions.\nJessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.\nThe unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.\nPaul said: “I never doubted we’d find the carryall. Once my father moves to solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to discover.”\nHe’s boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn’t boast. No person who'll be sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has the right to boast.\nThere is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nessica heard the disturbance in the great hall,\nturned on the light beside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A.M.\nThe disturbance was loud and incoherent.\nIs this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.\nShe slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family was. The screen Showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they’d hastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn’t penetrating to his quarters. There was no one in the Duke’s room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.?\nThere were no screens yet to the front of the house.\nJessica stood in the middle of her room, listening. There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr. Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into\nSlippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.\nAgain, a voice called out for Yueh.\nJessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the thought struck her: What if\nLeto’s hurt?\nThe hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned through the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum.\nTo her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting silence to the scene.\nOne of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: “You see what you did? You woke the Lady Jessica.”\nThe great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door remained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one Side staring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.\n“So | woke the Lady Jessica,” Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the ceiling, bellowed: “My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman!”\nGreat Mother! He’s drunk! Jessica thought.\nIdaho’s dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the fur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.\nJessica crossed to him.\nOne of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. “We didn’t know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance out\nfront, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along and see him. That wouldn’t do at all. Give us a bad name here.”\n“Where has he been?” Jessica asked.\n“He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat’s orders.”\n“Which young lady?”\n“One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?” He glanced at Mapes, lowered his voice. “They’re always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of the ladies.”\nAnd Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?\nShe frowned, turned to Mapes. “Mapes, bring a stimulant. I'd suggest caffeine. Perhaps there’s some of the spice coffee left.”\nMapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor.\nIdaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica. “Killed more’n three hunner’ men f’r the Duke,” he muttered. “Whadduh wanna know is why’m mere? Can't live unner th’ groun’ here. Can’t live onna groun’ here. Wha’ kinna place is \"iss, huh?”\nA sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica’s attention. She turned, saw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was fully dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his forehead.\n“Th’ good docker!” Idaho shouted. “Whad’re you, Doc? Splint ’n’ pill man?” He turned blearily toward\nJessica. “Makin’ uh damn fool uh m’self, huh?”\nJessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk? Was he drugged?\n“Too much spice beer,” Idaho said, attempting to Straighten.\nMapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, Stopped uncertainly behind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.\nYueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: “Spice beer, eh?”\n“Bes’ damn stuff ever tas’ed,” Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to attention. “My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon...Harkon... killed ‘im f’r th’ Duke.”\nYueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes’ hand. “What is that?”\n“Caffeine,” Jessica said.\nYueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. “Drink this, lad.”\n“Don’t wan’ any more t’ drink.”\n“Drink it, | say!”\nIdaho’s head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging the guards with him. “I’m almighdy fed up with pleasin’ th’ ’Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus’ once, we’re gonna do th’ thing my way.\n“After you drink this,” Yueh said. “It’s just caffeine.”\n“\"Sprolly like all res’ uh this place! Damn’ sun ’stoo brighd. Nothin’ has uh righd color. Ever’thing’s wrong Ofiri”\n”\n“Well, it’s nighttime now,” Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. “Drink this like a good lad. It'll make you feel better.”\n“Don’ wanna feel bedder!”\n“We can’t argue with him all night,” Jessica said. And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.\n“There\n######################\nOutput:",

Jus’ once, we’re gonna do th’ thing my way.\n“After you drink this,” Yueh said. “It’s just caffeine.”\n“\"Sprolly like all res’ uh this place! Damn’ sun ’stoo brighd. Nothin’ has uh righd color. Ever’thing’s wrong Ofiri”\n”\n“Well, it’s nighttime now,” Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. “Drink this like a good lad. It'll make you feel better.”\n“Don’ wanna feel bedder!”\n“We can’t argue with him all night,” Jessica said. And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.\n“There’s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,” Yueh said. “I can take care of this.”\nJessica shook her head. She stepped forward, Slapped Idaho sharply across the cheek.\nHe stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.\n“This is no way to act in your Duke’s home,” she said. She snatched the cup from Yueh’s hands, Spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. “Now drink this! That’s an order!”\nIdaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with careful and precise enunciation: “I do not take orders from a damn’ Harkonnen spy.”\nYueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.\nHer face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her—the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze flickering.\nThey were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!\nShe shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.\n“You knew this?” she demanded.\n“l,..heard rumors, my Lady. But | didn’t want to add to your burdens.”\n“Hawat!” she snapped. “I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!”\n“But, my Lady....”\n“Immediately!”\nIt has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately.\nIdaho shook his head, mumbled. “Chuck th’ whole damn thing.”\nJessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents across Idaho’s face. “Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing,” she ordered. “Let him sleep it off.”\nThe two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: “Perhaps we should take him someplace else, m’Lady. We could....”\n“He’s supposed to be here!” Jessica snapped. “He has a job to do here.” Her voice dripped bitterness. “He’s so good at watching the ladies.”\nThe guard swallowed.\n“Do you know where the Duke is?” she demanded.\n“He’s at the command post, my Lady.”\n“Is Hawat with him?”\n“Hawat’s in the city, my Lady.”\n“You will bring Hawat to me at once,” Jessica said. “I will be in my sitting room when he arrives.”\n“But, my Lady....”\n“If necessary, | will call the Duke,” she said. “I hope it will not be necessary. | would not want to disturb him with this.”\n“Yes, my Lady.”\nJessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes’ hands, met the questioning stare of the blue-within-blue eyes. “You may return to bed, Mapes.”\n“You're sure you'll not need me?”\nJessica smiled grimly. “I’m sure.”\n“Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow,” Yueh said. “I could give you a sedative and....”\n“You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,” she said. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. “This is the only Way.”\nAbruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her rooms. Cold walls... passages...a familiar door.... She jerked the door open, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the shield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought? We shall see.\nJessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once more, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight\nchairs along the wall, the two low tables, her stand- mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.\nPale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat down in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair’s regal heaviness for this occasion.\nNow, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating patience, saving her strength.\nSooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at her command.\nShe watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath. Hawat’s rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the room’s light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm.\nShe smelled blood there.\nJessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: “Bring that chair and sit facing me.”\nHawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He studied Jessica’s face, wondering how he could save this situation.\n“It’s long past time to clear the air between us,” Jessica said.\n“What troubles my Lady?” He sat down, placed hands on knees.\n“Don’t play coy with me!” she snapped. “If Yueh didn’t tell you why | summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at least that honest with each other?”\n“As you wish, my Lady.”\n“First, you will answer me one question,” she said. “Are you now a Harkonnen agent?”\nHawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: “You dare insult me so?”\n“Sit down,” she said. “You insulted me so.”\nSlowly, he sank back into the chair.\nAnd Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed herself a deep breath. /t isn’t Hawat.\n“Now | know you remain loyal to my Duke,” she said. “I’m prepared, therefore, to forgive your affront to me.”\n“Is there something to forgive?”\nJessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the Duke’s daughter I’ve carried within me these few weeks? No...Leto himself doesn’t know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when he must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.\n“A Truthsayer would solve this,” she said, “but we have no Truthsayer qualified by the High Board.”\n“AS you say. We've no Truthsayer.”\n“Is there a traitor among us?” she asked. “I’ve Studied our people with great care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It’s not you, Thufir. It cannot be Paul. | know it’s not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him in and put him to the test?”\n“You know that’s an empty gesture,” Hawat said. “He’s conditioned by the High College. That | know\nfor certain.”\n“Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit Slain by the Harkonnens,” Jessica said.\n“So that’s what happened to her,” Hawat said.\n“Haven't you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?”\n“You know | don’t have the ear,” Hawat said.\n“What brought this base suspicion on me?” she asked.\nHawat frowned. “My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first loyalty is to the Duke.” “I’m prepared to forgive much because of that\nloyalty,” she said.\n“And again | must ask: Is there something to forgive?”\n“Stalemate?” she asked.\nHe shrugged.\n“Let us discuss something else for a minute, then,” she said. “Duncan Idaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer. | hear reports that others among our people have been Stupefied by this concoction. Is that true?”\n“You have your reports, my Lady.”\n“So | do. Don’t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?”\n“My Lady speaks riddles.”\n“Apply your Mentat abilities to it!” she snapped. “What’s the problem with Duncan and the others? | can tell you in four words—they have no home.”\nHe jabbed a finger at the floor. “Arrakis, that’s their home.”\n“Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we’ve uprooted them. They have no home. And they fear the Duke’s failing them.”\nHe stiffened. “Such talk from one of the men would be cause for—”\n“Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.”\n“The Duke gives me charge over such matters.”\n“But you understand | have a certain natural concern over the progress of this disease,” she said. “And perhaps you'll grant | have certain abilities along these lines.”\nWill I have to shock him severely? she wondered. He needs shaking up—something to break him from routine.\n“There could be many interpretations for your concern,” Hawat said. He shrugged.\n“Then you've already convicted me?”\n“Of course not, my Lady. But | cannot afford to take any chances, the situation being what it is.”\n“A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,” she said. “Who took that chance?”\nHis face darkened. “I offered my resignation to the Duke.”\n“Did you offer your resignation to me...or to Paul?”\nNow he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.\n“I’m the Duke’s man,” he said, biting off the words.\n“There is no traitor,” she said. “The threat’s something else. Perhaps it has to do with the lasguns. Perhaps they'll risk secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they’ll....”\n“And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn’t atomic?” he asked. “No, my Lady. They'll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers. The evidence is hard to erase. No. They'll observe most of the forms. It has to be a traitor.”\n“You're the Duke’s man\n######################\nOutput:",

Destroy the place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those who love the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the other’s place. Could | not whisper Suspicions about you into the Duke’s ear at night? When would he be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?”\n“You threaten me?” he growled.\n“Indeed not. | merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through the basic arrangement of our lives. It’s clever, diabolical. | propose to negate this attack by so ordering our lives that there’ll be no chinks for such barbs to enter.”\n“You accuse me of whispering baseless Suspicions?”\n“Baseless, yes.”\n“You'd meet this with your own whispers?”\n“Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.”\n“Then you question my abilities?”\nShe sighed. “Thufir, | want you to examine your own emotional involvement in this. The natural human’s an animal without logic. Your projections of logic onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for its usefulness. You’re the embodiment of logic—a Mentat. Yet, your problem solutions are concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself, there to be studied and rolled around, examined from all sides.”\n“You think now to teach me my trade?” he asked, and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice.\n“Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,” she said. “But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us.”\n“You're deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a Mentat,” he rasped. “Were | to find one of our people attempting thus to sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, | should not hesitate to denounce and destroy him.”\n“The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their computations,” she said.\n“I’ve never said otherwise!”\n“Then apply yourself to these symptoms we've both seen: drunkenness among the men, quarrels— they gossip and exchange wild rumors about Arrakis; they ignore the most simple—”\n“Idleness, no more,” he said. “Don’t try to divert my attention by trying to make a simple matter appear mysterious.”\nShe stared at him, thinking of the Duke’s men rubbing their woes together in the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt insulation. They’re becoming like the men of the pre- Guild legend, she thought: Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros—sick at their guns—forever seeking, forever prepared and forever unread.\n“Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the Duke?” she asked. “Do you fear a rival for your position?”\nHe glared at her, the old eyes blazing. “I know some of the training they give you Bene Gesserit....” He broke off, scowling.\n“Go ahead, say it,” she said. “Bene Gesserit witches.”\n“I know something of the real training they give you,” he said. “I’ve seen it come out in Paul. I’m not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you exist only to serve.”\nThe shock must be severe and he’s almost ready for it, she thought.\n“You listen respectfully to me in Council,” she said, “yet you seldom heed my advice. Why?”\n“I don’t trust your Bene Gesserit motives,” he said. “You may think you can look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what you\n“You poor foo/, Thufir!” she raged.\nHe scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.\n“Whatever rumors you've heard about our schools,” she said, “the truth is far greater. If | wished to destroy the Duke...or you, or any other person within my reach, you could not stop me.”\nAnd she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is not the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.\nHawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of poison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. /s this just a brag she makes? | could slay her now...but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I’m wrong.\nJessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: “Let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us.”\n“A worthy prayer,” he agreed.\n“Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us,” she said. “I must ask you again: Isn’t it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this Suspicion to pit the two of us against each other?”\n“We appear to’ve returned to stalemate,” he said.\nShe sighed, thinking: He’s almost ready for it.\n“The Duke and | are father and mother surrogates to our people,” she said. “The position—”\n“He hasn’t married you,” Hawat said.\nShe forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.\n“But he’ll not marry anyone else,” she said. “Not as long as | live. And we are surrogates, as I’ve said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, to disturb, disrupt, and confuse us—which target offers itself most enticingly to the Harkonnens?”\nHe sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a lowering scowl.\n“The Duke?” she asked. “Attractive target, yes, but no one with the possible exception of Paul is better guarded. Me? | tempt them, surely, but they must know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there’s a better target, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One to whom Suspicion is as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life on innuendo and mystery.” She darted her right hand toward him. “You!”\nHawat started to leap from his chair.\n“I have not dismissed you, Thufir!” she flared.\nThe old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles betray him.\nShe smiled without mirth.\n“Now you know something of the real training they give us,” she said.\nHawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her command had been regal, peremptory—uttered ina tone and manner he had found completely irresistible. His body had obeyed her before he could think about it. Nothing could have prevented his response—not logic, not passionate anger...nothing. To do what she had done spoke of a sensitive,\nintimate knowledge of the person thus commanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible.\n“I have said to you before that we should understand each other,” she said. “I meant you should understand me. | already understand you. And | tell you now that your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me.”\nHe stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue.\n“If | desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me,” She said. “He might even think he did it of his own free will.”\nHawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes. Only the most rigid control kept him from calling the guard. Control...and the suspicion now that the woman might not permit it. His skin crawled with the memory of how she had controlled him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn a weapon and killed him!\nDoes every human have this blind spot? he wondered. Can any of us be ordered into action before he can resist? The idea staggered him. Who could stop a person with such power?\n“You've glimpsed the fist within the Bene Gesserit glove,” she said. “Few glimpse it and live. And what | did was a relatively simple thing for us. You’ve not seen my entire arsenal. Think on that.”\n“Why aren’t you out destroying the Duke’s enemies?” he asked.\n“What would you have me destroy?” she asked. “Would you have me make a weakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?”\n“But, with such power....”\n“Power’s a two-edged sword, Thufir,” she said. “You think: ‘How easy for her to shape a human tool to thrust into an enemy’s vitals.’ True, Thufir; even into your vitals. Yet, what would | accomplish? If enough of us Bene Gesserit did this, wouldn’t it make all Bene Gesserit Suspect? We don’t want that, Thufir. We do not wish to destroy ourselves.” She nodded. “We truly exist only to serve.”\n“I cannot answer you,” he said. “You know I cannot answer.”\n“You'll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone,” she said. “I Know you, Thufir.”\n“My Lady....” Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.\nAnd he thought: She has great powers, yes. But would these not make her an even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?\n“The Duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies,” she said. “I trust now you'll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove ite.\n“If it proves baseless,” he said.\n“Tf,” she sneered.\n“If,” he said.\n“You are tenacious,” she said.\n“Cautious,” he said, “and aware of the error factor.”\n“Then l'Il pose another question for you: What does it mean to you that you stand before another human, that you are bound and helpless and the other human holds a knife at your throat—yet this other human refrains from killing you, frees you from\nyour bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?”\nShe lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him. “You may go now, Thufir.”\nThe old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon beneath his tunic. He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Duke’s father (who'd been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida long ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and confused. The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns, cape thrown flamboyantly over one arm, while\n######################\nOutput:",

He withdrew his hand from the weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.\nAnd he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never forget this moment nor lose this sense of Supreme admiration for the Lady Jessica.\nQuietly, he turned and left the room.\nJessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and stared at the closed door.\n“Now we'll see some proper action,” she whispered.\nDo you wrestle with dreams? Do you contend with shadows? Do you move in a kind of sleep? Time has slipped away.\nYour life is stolen.\nYou tarried with trifles,\nVictim of your folly.\n—DIRGE FOR JAMIS ON THE FUNERAL PLAIN, FROM “SONGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| eto stood in the foyer of his house, studying a note by the light of a single suspensor lamp. Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness. A Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke arrived from his command post.\nThe note read: “A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.”\nThere was no signature.\nWhat does it mean? he wondered.\nThe messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be questioned. He had Slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.\nLeto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat later. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath. The antifatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had\nbeen a long two days since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.\nOn top of all the military problems, there’d been the disquieting session with Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.\nShould | waken Jessica? he wondered. There’s no reason to play the secrecy game with her any longer. Or is there?\nBlast and damn that Duncan Idaho!\nHe shook his head. No, not Duncan. | was wrong not to take Jessica into my confidence from the first. | must do it now, before more damage is done.\nThe decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.\nAt the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put his left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand. The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange sound had sent a chill through him.\nSoftly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate illumination. The smallest of Suspensors had been spaced about eight meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone walls swallowed the light.\nA dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.\nLeto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that would limit his movements,\nhis hearing...and because the captured shipment of lasguns had left him filled with doubts.\nSilently, he moved toward the gray blob, saw that it was a human figure, a man face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent close in the dim light to see the face. It was the Smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain down his chest. The dead eyes stared with empty darkness. Leto touched the stain—warm.\nHow could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?\nThe mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator for the house.\nHand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke Skirted the body, slipped down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.\nAnother gray blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at once this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward him with painful slowness, gasping, mumbling.\nLeto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage, crouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the Fremen housekeeper, her hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side. He touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes black-shadowed emptiness.\n“S’you,” she gasped. “Killed...guard...sent...get... Tuek...escape...m’Lady...you...you...here...no....” She flopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.\nLeto felt for pulse at the temples. There was none. He looked at the stain: she’d been stabbed in the back. Who? His mind raced. Did she mean someone had killed a guard? And Tuek—had Jessica sent for him? Why?\nHe started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand toward the shield switch—too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm aside. He felt pain there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it up his arm. It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the passage.\nYueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected yellow from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door. There was stillness from the room behind him—no sound of generators.\nYueh! Leto thought. He’s sabotaged the house generators! We’re wide open!\nYueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.\nLeto found he could still speak, gasped: “Yueh! How?” Then the paralysis reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the stone wall.\nYueh’s face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto’s forehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote...dull.\n“The drug on the dart Is selective,” Yueh said. “You can speak, but I’d advise against it.” He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the dart clattering on the stones was faint and distant to the Duke’s ears.\nIt can’t be Yueh, Leto thought. He’s conditioned.\n“How?” Leto whispered.\n“I’m sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater demands than this.” He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead. “I find it very strange, myself—an override on my pyretic conscience—but | wish to kill a man. Yes, | actually wish it. | will stop at nothing to do it.”\nHe looked down at the Duke. “Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron Harkonnen. | wish to kill the Baron.”\n“Bar...On Har....”\n“Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven’t much time. That peg tooth I put in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal—that tooth must be replaced. In a moment, l'Il render you unconscious and replace that tooth.” He opened his hand, stared at something in it. “An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve. It’ll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you bite down hard on it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your breath sharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas—most deadly.”\nLeto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man’s eyes, the perspiration along brow and chin.\n“You were dead anyway, my poor Duke,” Yueh said. “But you will get close to the Baron before you die. He'll believe you’re stupefied by drugs beyond any dying effort to attack him. And you will be drugged—and tied. But attack can take strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth, Duke Leto Atreides. You will remember the tooth.”\nThe old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache dominated Leto’s narrowing vision.\n“The tooth,” Yueh muttered.\n“Why?” Leto whispered.\nYueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. “I made a shaitan’s bargain with the Baron. And | must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it. When I see him, l'Il Know. When I look at the Baron, then | will know. But l'Il never enter his presence without the price. You’re the price, my poor Duke. And l'Il Know when I see him. My poor Wanna taught me many things, and one is to see certainty of truth when the stress is great. | cannot do it always, but when | see the Baron—then, | wi// know.”\nLeto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh’s hand. He felt this was happening in a nightmare—it could not be.\nYueh’s purple lips turned up in a grimace. “lIl not get close enough to the Baron, or I’d do this myself. No. l'Il be detained at a safe distance. But you...ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He'll want you close to him—to gloat over you, to boast a little.”\nLeto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yueh’s jaw. The muscle twisted\nwhen the man spoke.\nYueh leaned closer. “And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must remember this tooth.” He held it up between thumb and forefinger. “It will be all that remains to you.”\nLeto’s mouth moved without sound, then: “Refuse.”\n“Ah-h, no! You mustn’t refuse. Because, in return for this small service, I’m doing a thing for you. | will Save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.”\n“How...Ssave...them?” Leto whispered.\n“By making it appear they’re dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.” He touched Leto’s jaw. “Can you feel anything in your jaw?”\nThe Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh’s hand come up with the ducal signet ring.\n“For Paul,” Yueh said. “You'll be unconscious presently.\n######################\nOutput:",

You mustn’t refuse. Because, in return for this small service, I’m doing a thing for you. | will Save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.”\n“How...Ssave...them?” Leto whispered.\n“By making it appear they’re dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.” He touched Leto’s jaw. “Can you feel anything in your jaw?”\nThe Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh’s hand come up with the ducal signet ring.\n“For Paul,” Yueh said. “You'll be unconscious presently. Goodbye, my poor Duke. When next we meet we'll have no time for conversation.”\nCool remoteness spread upward from Leto’s jaw, across his cheeks. The shadowy hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh’s purple lips centered in it.\n“Remember the tooth!” Yueh hissed. “The tooth!”\nThere should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the\nstillness around her. She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish. Skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt...strange.\nLump-lump-lump-lump!\nIt was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere.\nThe waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needlestick movements.\nShe began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a gag in her mouth. She was on her side, hands tied behind her. She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled.\nAnd now, she remembered.\nThere had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her. She had gasped—one indrawn breath—sensing the narcotic in the wetness. Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.\nIt has come, she thought. How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All it took was treachery. Hawat was right.\nShe forced herself not to pull on her bindings.\nThis is not my bedroom, she thought. They’ve taken me someplace else.\nSlowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.\nShe grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear.\nWhere is Paul? she asked herself. My son—what have they done to him?\nCalmness.\nShe forced herself to it, using the ancient routines.\nBut terror remained so near.\nLeto? Where are you, Leto?\nShe sensed a diminishing in the dark. It began with shadows. Dimensions separated, became new thorns of awareness. White. A line under a door.\nl'm on the floor.\nPeople walking. She sensed it through the floor.\nJessica squeezed back the memory of terror. / must remain calm, alert, and prepared. | may get only one chance. Again, she forced the inner calmness.\nThe ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, Shaping out time. She counted back. / was unconscious about an hour. She closed her eyes, focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps.\nFour people.\nShe counted the differences in their steps.\nI must pretend I’m still unconscious. She relaxed against the cold floor, testing her body’s readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through her eyelids.\nFeet approached: someone standing over her.\n“You are awake,” rumbled a basso voice. “Do not pretend.”\nShe opened her eyes.\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side—empty. Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.\nShe looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spider- black eyes.\n“The drug was timed,” he rumbled. “We knew to the minute when you’d be coming out of it.”\nHow could that be? she wondered. They’d have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my.... Yueh!\n“Such a pity you must remain gagged,” the Baron said. “We could have such an interesting conversation.”\nYueh’s the only one it could be, she thought. How?\nThe Baron glanced behind him at the door. “Come in, Piter.”\nShe had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but the face was known— and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She studied him—hawk features, blue-ink eyes that\nsuggested he was a native of Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his flesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy.\n“Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica,” the Baron said. “However, I’m aware of your abilities.” He glanced at the Mentat. “Isn’t that true, Piter?”\n“AS you say, Baron,” the man said.\nThe voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the voice screamed: Killer!\n“I have a surprise for Piter,” the Baron said. “He thinks he has come here to collect his reward—you, Lady Jessica. But | wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.”\n“You play with me, Baron?” Piter asked, and he smiled.\nSeeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend himself from this Piter. Then She corrected herself. The Baron could not read that smile. He did not have the Training.\n“In many ways, Piter is quite naive,” the Baron said. “He doesn’t admit to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I’d show him, but it'd be a foolish risk.” The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting mask. “I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power.”\n“You promised | could have her,” Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve.\nJessica heard the clue-tones in the man’s voice, allowed herself an inward shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?\n“I give you a choice, Piter,” the Baron said.\n“What choice?”\nThe Baron snapped fat fingers. “This woman and exile from the Imperium, or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.”\nJessica watched the Baron’s spider eyes study Piter.\n“You could be Duke here in all but name,” the Baron said.\nIs my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.\nThe Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. “Understand yourself, Piter. You want her because She was a Duke’s woman, a symbol of his power— beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That’s more than a symbol; that’s the reality. With it you could have many women...and more.”\n“You do not joke with Piter?”\nThe Baron turned with that dancing lightness the Suspensors gave him. “Joke? I? Remember—/ am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the lad’s training. They are alike, this mother and son—deadly.” The Baron smiled. “I must go now. | will send in the guard I’ve reserved for this moment. He’s stone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He'll not permit you to untie her gag until you're off\nArrakis. If you choose not to leave...he has other orders.”\n“You don’t have to leave,” Piter said. “I’ve chosen.”\n“Ah, hah!” the Baron chortled. “Such quick decision can mean only one thing.”\n“I will take the duchy,” Piter said.\nAnd Jessica thought: Doesn’t Piter know the Baron’s lying to him? But—how could he know? He’s a twisted Mentat.\nThe Baron glanced down at Jessica. “Is it not wonderful that | know Piter so well? | wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter’s choice. Hah! Well, | leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady Jessica? | had no rancor toward you. It’s a necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And l’ve not actually ordered you destroyed. When it’s asked of me what happened to you, I can Shrug it off in all truth.”\n“You leave it to me then?” Piter asked.\n“The guard | send you will take your orders,” the Baron said. “Whatever's done | leave to you.” He Stared at Piter. “Yes. There will be no blood on my hands here. It’s your decision. Yes. | know nothing of it. You will wait until I’ve gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well...ah, yes. Yes. Good.”\nHe fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah- h-h-h, my poor Leto.\nWith one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She followed him with her eyes, thinking: /t’s as the Reverend Mother warned—too potent an adversary.\nTwo Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.\nThe deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron Knows I could use the Voice on any other man.\nScarface looked at Piter. “We’ve the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?”\nPiter spoke to Jessica. “I’d thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but | begin to see that would not have worked. | let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: “Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found.”\n“You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?” Scarface asked.\nHe reads lips, Jessica thought.\n“I follow my Baron’s example,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor said.”\nJessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.\nPiter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he\n######################\nOutput:",

He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out without turning.\n“Me, | wouldn’t like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this night’s work,” Scarface said.\n“You ain’t likely ever to run into that old witch,” one of the other troopers said. He went around to Jessica’s head, bent over her. “It ain’t getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and—”\n“Why’n’t we kill ’em here?” Scarface asked.\n“Too messy,” the first one said. “Unless you wants to strangle ’em. Me, | likes a nice straightforward job. Drop ’em on the desert like that traitor said, cut ’em once or twice, leave the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up afterwards.”\n“Yeah...well, | guess you’re right,” Scarface said.\nJessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.\nScarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor- buoyed litter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter, she saw her companion’s face—Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.\nIs he drugged? she wondered.\nThe troopers lifted the litter, and Paul’s eyes opened the smallest fraction—dark slits staring at her.\nHe mustn't try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!\nPaul’s eyes closed.\nHe had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.\nPaul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother’s face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though.\nHe wondered who could've captured her. His own captivity was plain enough—to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it —a Suk doctor a traitor.\nThe litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A ’thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground.\nPaul’s eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the ‘thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.\n“This the ‘thopter we're supposed to use?” he asked, and turned to watch his companion’s lips.\n“It’s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,” the other said.\nScarface nodded. “But—it’s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain’t room in there for more’n them an’\ntwo of us.”\n“Two’s enough,” said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading. “We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.”\n“The Baron, he told me to make sure what happened to them two,” Scarface said.\n“What you so worried about?” asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer.\n“She is a Bene Gesserit witch,” the deaf one said. “They have powers.”\n“Ah-h-h....” The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. “One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.”\nThe trooper behind him grunted. “She'll be worm meat soon enough. Don’t suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?” He nudged the litter-bearer.\n“Yee-up,” the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica’s shoulders. “C’mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens.”\n“It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,” Scarface said.\nJessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning —stars. She was pushed into the rear of the 'thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope.\nScarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat.\nKinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The ‘thopter took off in a wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his companion’s shoulder, said: “Whyn’t you turn around and keep an eye on them two?”\n“Sure you know the way to go?” Kinet watched Czigo’s lips.\n“I listened to the traitor same’s you.”\nKinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of Starlight on a lasgun in his hand. The ‘thopter’s light- walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guard’s scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would Snap at a sudden jerk.\nHas someone been at this ’thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul’s.\n“Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this,” Scarface said. “You ever have any highborn types?” He turned to look at the pilot.\n“Bene Gesserit ain’t all highborn,” the pilot said.\n“But they all looks heighty.”\nHe can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.\n“Real pretty, she is,” Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. “Sure do seem a shame.” He looked at Czigo.\n“You thinking what I think you’re thinking?” the pilot asked.\n“Who'd be to know?” the guard asked. “Afterwards....” He shrugged. “I just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again.”\n“You lay a hand on my mother....” Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.\n“Hey!” the pilot laughed. “Cub’s got a bark. Ain’t got no bite, though.”\nAnd Jessica thought: Paul’s pitching his voice too high. It may work, though.\nThey flew on in silence.\nThese poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron’s words. They'll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.\nThe ‘thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.\n“This oughta be far enough,” the pilot said. “The traitor said to put ’em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.” He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.\nJessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn’t mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails....\nThe ‘thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, Saw a Shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.\nSomeone’s following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there’ll\nbe watchers for the watchers, too.\nCzigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.\nJessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.\nPaul cleared his throat.\nThe pilot said: “Now, Kinet?”\n“| dunno, Czigo.”\nCzigo turned, said: “Ah-h-h, look.” He reached out for Jessica’s skirt.\n“Remove her gag,” Paul commanded.\nJessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent—imperative, very sharp. A Slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man’s spectrum.\nCzigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica’s mouth, slipped the knot on the gag.\n“Stop that!” Kinet ordered.\n“Ah, shut your trap,” Czigo said. “Her hands’re tied.” He freed the knot and the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.\nKinet put a hand on the pilot’s arm. “Look, Czigo, no need to....”\nJessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. “Gentlemen! No need to fight over me.” At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet’s benefit.\nShe saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over\nher. Their disagreement required no other reason. In their minds, they were fighting over her.\nShe held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: “You mustn’t disagree.” They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other. “Is any woman worth fighting over?” she asked.\nBy uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.\nPaul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now—everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.\n“Yeah,” Scarface said. “No need to fight over....”\nHis hand flashed toward the pilot’s neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet’s chest.\nScarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.\n“Thought | was some dummy didn’t know that trick,” Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\n“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.\n“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.\nCzigo hesitated.\n“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked.\n######################\nOutput:",

He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.\n“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.\n“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.\nCzigo hesitated.\n“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked. “Give the boy a chance.” Her lip curled in a sneer. “Little enough chance he’d have out there in that sand. Give him that and....” She smiled. “You could find yourself well rewarded.”\nCzigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. “I’ve heard me what can happen to a man in this desert,” he said. “Boy might find the knife a kindness.”\n“Is it so much | ask?” Jessica pleaded.\n“You're trying to trick me,” Czigo muttered.\n“I don’t want to see my son die,” Jessica said. “Is that a trick?”\nCzigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. “What’ll y’ do, cub, if | cut y’r bonds?”\n“He'll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,” Jessica said.\n“Is that what y’ll do, cub?” Czigo asked.\nPaul’s voice was properly surly. “Yes.”\nThe knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot.\nThe toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft part of Czigo’s abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the man’s heart.\nWith one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing\nwith a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.\n“I could’ve handled him,” she said. “He’d have had to cut my bindings. That was a foolish risk.”\n“I saw the opening and used it,” he said.\nShe heard the harsh control in his voice, said: “Yueh’s house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.”\nHe looked up, saw the curling symbol.\n“Get out and let us study this craft,” she said. “There’s a bundle under the pilot’s seat. | felt it when we got in.”\n“Bomb?”\n“Doubt it. There’s something peculiar here.”\nPaul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo’s feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot’s blood.\nWaste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.\nPaul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the ‘thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another ‘thopter swooping toward them, realized they’d not\nhave time to clear the bodies out of this ’thopter and escape. “Run, Paul!” Jessica shouted. “It’s Harkonnens!”\nArrakis teaches the attitude of the knife—chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: “Now, it’s complete because it’s ended here.”\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nman in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at\nthe end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes’ body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh.\nSardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the Emperor’s own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform, there’s no disguising them.\n“You're Yueh,” the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctor’s hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh’s eyes.\n“lam Yueh,” the Doctor said.\n“You can relax, Yueh,” the man said. “When you dropped the house shields we came right in. Everything’s under control here. Is this the Duke?”\n“This is the Duke.”\n“Dead?”\n“Merely unconscious. | suggest you tie him.”\n“Did you do for these others?” He glanced back down the hall where Mapes’ body lay.\n“More’s the pity,” Yueh muttered.\n“Pity!” the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto.\n“So that’s the great Red Duke.”\nIf | had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought. Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Dukes.\nThe Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto’s uniform. “Little souvenir,” he said. “Where’s the ducal signet ring?”\n“He doesn’t have it on him,” Yueh said.\n“I can see that!” the Sardaukar snapped.\nYueh stiffened, swallowed. /f they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they'll find out about the ring, about the ‘thopter | prepared—all will fail.\n“Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as Surety that an order came directly from him,” Yueh said.\n“Must be damned trusted messengers,” the Sardaukar muttered.\n“Aren't you going to tie him?” Yueh ventured.\n“How long’ll he be unconscious?”\n“Two hours or so. | wasn’t as precise with his dosage as | was for the woman and boy.”\nThe Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. “This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?”\n“About ten minutes.”\n“So soon?”\n“I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.”\n“So he will. You’ll wait outside, Yueh.” He shot a hard glance at Yueh. “Now!”\nYueh glanced at Leto. “What about....”\n“He'll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven.” Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh’s forehead. “You’re known; you'll be safe enough in the halls. We’ve no more time for chit-chat, traitor. | hear the others coming.”\nTraitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.\nHe passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform.\nHarkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames.\n“It’s the traitor,” Someone said.\n“The Baron will want to see you soon,” another said.\nI must get to the 'thopter, Yueh thought. / must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it. And fear struck him: /f Idaho suspects me or grows impatient— if he doesn’t wait and go exactly where I told him—\nJessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage. lIl be denied even the smallest relief from my act.\nThe Harkonnen guard released his arm, said “Wait over there out of the way.”\nAbruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the Smallest pity. /daho must not fail!\nAnother guard bumped into him, barked: “Stay out of the way, you!”\nEven when they’ve profited by me they despise me, Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.\n“Wait for the Baron!” a guard officer snarled.\nYueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into Shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the ‘thopter waited—the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother.\nA guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room.\nHow confident they were!\nYueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the ‘thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.\nSoftly, Yueh closed the ‘thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees.\nNow, it is done, he thought.\nOnce more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron—he will encounter a small tooth.\nThere is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.\n—FROM “INTRODUCTION TO A CHILD’S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport\nof the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work.\nExplosive artillery.\nThe guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke’s fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination—and the Duke’s men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught\n######################\nOutput:",

Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron—he will encounter a small tooth.\nThere is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.\n—FROM “INTRODUCTION TO A CHILD’S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport\nof the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work.\nExplosive artillery.\nThe guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke’s fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination—and the Duke’s men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.\nThe Baron could feel the distant chomping—a drumbeat carried to him through the ship’s metal: broomp...broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!\nWho would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke’s men would run for those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.\nHe adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls.\nA pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke’s, he thought. He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.\nA door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-blackened viewport before turning.\nPiter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Baron’s personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheeplike in his presence.\nThe Baron turned.\nPiter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. “Good news, m’Lord. The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.”\n“Of course they have,” the Baron rumbled.\nHe studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter’s effeminate face. And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.\nSoon | must remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then—they will welcome my darling Feyd- Rautha as a savior.\nThe Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain—Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe—a man to be trusted because the captain’s vices were known.\n“First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?” the Baron asked. “I must give the traitor his reward.”\nPiter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.\nA bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron.\n“Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.”\n“M’Lord Harkonnen.”\n“You've given us the Duke, | hear.”\n“My half of the bargain, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron looked at Piter.\nPiter nodded.\nThe Baron looked back at Yueh. “The letter of the bargain, eh? And l....” He spat the words out: “What was | to do in return?”\n“You remember quite well, m’Lord Harkonnen.”\nAnd Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron’s manner. Wanna was indeed dead—gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there’d still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron’s manner showed there was no hold; it was ended.\n“Do |?” the Baron asked.\n“You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.”\nThe Baron nodded. “Oh, yes. Now, | remember. So | did. That was my promise. That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn’t endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter’s pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises. | told you I’d free her from the agony and permit you to join her. So be it.” He waved a hand at Piter.\nPiter’s blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was Catlike in its sudden fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh’s back.\nThe old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron.\n“So join her!” the Baron spat.\nYueh stood, swaying. His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: “You...think...you...de...feated...me. You... think...|...did...not...know...what...|...bo0ught...for... my...Wanna.”\nHe toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling.\n“So join her,” the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.\nYueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.\nSo that’s how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. /t’s well to know.\n“He did give us the Duke?” the Baron asked.\n“Of a certainty, my Lord,” Piter said.\n“Then get him in here!”\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.\nThe Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones.\n“I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,” the Baron said. “Not even a traitor | created.”\nHe glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron’s mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain white.\nBut there was still the feeling of doubt.\nWhat had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he’d probably known what would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he’d been defeated: “You think you defeated me.”\nWhat had he meant?\nThe Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains, the eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke’s eyes held a glazed, insane look.\n“Wel-I-I-I,” the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long-envisioned, had lost some of its Savor.\nDamn that cursed doctor through all eternity!\n“I believe the good Duke is drugged,” Piter said. “That’s how Yueh caught him for us.” Piter turned to the Duke. “Aren’t you drugged, my dear Duke?”\nThe voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.\n“What of the woman and the boy, Piter?” the Baron asked. “Any word yet?”\nPiter’s tongue darted over his lips.\n“You've heard something!” the Baron snapped. “What?”\nPiter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. “The men who were sent to do the job, m’Lord —they’ve...ah...been...ah...found.”\n“Well, they report everything satisfactory?”\n“They're dead, m’Lord.”\n“Of course they are! What | want to know is—”\n“They were dead when found, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron’s face went livid. “And the woman and boy?”\n“No sign, m’Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being investigated. Perhaps it’s as we wished—an accident. Possibly—”\n“We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing ‘thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?”\n“One of the Duke’s men obviously escaped in it, m’Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped.”\n“Which of the Duke’s men?”\n“It was a Clean, silent killing, m’Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant.”\n“Possibilities,” the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke.\n“The situation is in hand, m’Lord,” Piter said.\n“No, it isn’t! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?”\n“We've word where to find him and he’s been sent for, m’Lord.”\n“I don’t like the way the Emperor’s servant is helping us,” the Baron muttered.\nThey were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto’s mind. Woman and boy —no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.\n“Where is the ducal signet ring?” the Baron demanded. “His finger is bare.”\n“The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,” the guard captain said.\n“You killed the doctor too soon,” the Baron said. “That was a mistake. You should’ve warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.” He scowled. “Possibilities!”\nThe thought hung like a sine wave in Leto’s mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it.\nThe tooth!\nHe remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.\nSomeone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it.\nNot yet!\nThe someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn't remember.\n“How long will he remain drugged like this?” the Baron asked.\n“Perhaps another hour, m’Lord.”\n“Perhaps,” the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. “I am hungry.”\nThat’s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room\n######################\nOutput:",

Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. “I am hungry.”\nThat’s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness and faded.\nTime became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. / must wait.\nThere was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.\n“I believe he’s coming around, Baron.”\nA silky voice, that one. That was Piter.\n“So | see, Piter.”\nA rumbling basso: the Baron.\nLeto sensed increasing definition in his Surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.\nAnd he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man’s hands: compulsive touchings—the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl.\nLeto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.\n“You can hear me, Duke Leto,” the Baron said. “l know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.”\nNo sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. /t’s true, then: they don’t have Paul and Jessica.\n“This is not a child’s game we play,” the Baron rumbled. “You must know that.” He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this could not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see royalty in such straits—it set a bad precedent.\nLeto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped capsule within that tooth—the poison gas—he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth.\nYueh.\nDrug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto’s mind. He knew it had been Yueh.\n“Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?” the Baron asked.\nLeto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone’s agony.\n“We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen,” the Baron said. “We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them. I’ve lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?”\nLeto felt fear tighten his chest. /f Yueh sent them to the desert fold...the search won't stop until they're found.\n“Come, come,” the Baron said. “We don’t have much time and pain is quick. Please don’t bring it to this, my dear Duke.” The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto’s shoulder. “Piter doesn’t have all his tools here, but I’m sure he could improvise.”\n“Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.”\nThat silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.\n“You had an emergency plan,” the Baron said. “Where have your woman and the boy been sent?” He looked at Leto’s hand. “Your ring is missing. Does the boy have it?”\nThe Baron looked up, stared into Leto’s eyes.\n“You don’t answer,” he said. “Will you force me to do a thing | do not want to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. | agree they’re sometimes the best, but it’s not good that you should be subjected to such things.”\n“Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids,” Piter said. “Perhaps on other portions of the body. It’s especially effective when the subject doesn’t know where the tallow will fall next. It’s a good method and there’s a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?”\n“Exquisite,” the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.\nThose touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands—their compulsive wandering.\nThe sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke’s nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?\n“Believe me, cher cousin,” the Baron said. “I do not want it to come to this.”\n“You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,” Piter said. “There’s an artistry in this, you know.”\n“You're a superb artist,” the Baron growled. “Now, have the decency to be silent.”\nLeto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had Said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: “‘And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea...and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.’”\n“We waste time, Baron,” Piter said.\n“Perhaps.”\nThe Baron nodded. “You know, my dear Leto, you'll tell us in the end where they are. There’s a level of pain that'll buy you.”\nHe’s most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth...and the fact that I truly don’t know where they are.\nThe Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.\n“Observe this prize person who denies he’s for hire,” the Baron said. “Observe him, Piter.”\nAnd the Baron thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he’d rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?\nThe frog sounds in the background stopped.\nThe Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across the room, shake his head. The captive hadn’t produced the needed information. Another failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft fool who didn’t realize how much hell there was so near him—only a nerve’s thickness away.\nThis thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a Surgeon exercising endless Supple scissor dissections—cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath.\nRabbits, all of them!\nAnd how they cowered when they saw the Carnivore!\nLeto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end it all quickly. Still—it had been good, much of this life. He found himself remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell- blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on Arrakis—colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.\n“Too bad,” the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood up lightly in his Suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke. He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.\nHow he fears me! the Baron thought.\nShocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear—the silky-voiced one: Piter.\nIt got him, too!\n“Piter! What’s wrong?”\nThe rumbling voice was far away.\nLeto sensed memories rolling in his mind—the old toothless mutterings of hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes—blue within blue, the eyes—all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.\nThere was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery —so distant—a roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every... silence.\nOne thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.\nSilence.\nThe Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had Slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?\nSounds returned to him...and reason. He heard someone shouting orders—gas masks...keep a door closed...get blowers going.\nThe others fell quickly, he thought. /’m still standing. I’m still breathing. Merciless hell! That was close!\nHe could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been pushing himself away from the table...that and Piter’s Shocked gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.\nChance and the warning in a dying man’s gasp— these had saved him.\nThe Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And that stupid guard captain! He’d said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Baron’s presence! How had it been possible for the Duke...? No warning. Not even from the poison Snooper over the table—until it was too late. How?\nWell, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.\nHe grew aware of more activity down the hall— around the corner at the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for the Baron’s reaction.\nWould the Baron be angry?\nAnd the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.\nSome of the guards had weapons leveled at the door.

The fool had got himself killed. And that stupid guard captain! He’d said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Baron’s presence! How had it been possible for the Duke...? No warning. Not even from the poison Snooper over the table—until it was too late. How?\nWell, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.\nHe grew aware of more activity down the hall— around the corner at the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for the Baron’s reaction.\nWould the Baron be angry?\nAnd the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.\nSome of the guards had weapons leveled at the door. Some were directing their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises around the corner to their right.\nA man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps at his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this corridor.\nHe was yellow-haired, flat of face with green eyes. Crisp lines radiated from his thick-lipped mouth. He looked like some water creature misplaced among those who walked the land.\nThe Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud. lakin Nefud. Guard corporal. Nefud was addicted to semuta, the drug- music combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness. A useful item of information, that.\nThe man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted. “Corridor’s clear, m’Lord. | was outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas. Ventilators in your room were pulling air in from these corridors.” He glanced up at the snooper over the Baron’s head. “None of the stuff escaped. We have the room cleaned out now. What are your orders?”\nThe Baron recognized the man’s voice—the one who'd been shouting orders. Efficient, this corporal, he thought.\n“They’re all dead in there?” the Baron asked.\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\nWell, we must adjust, the Baron thought.\n“First,” he said, “let me congratulate you, Nefud. You’re the new captain of my guard. And | hope you'll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate of your predecessor.”\nThe Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman. Nefud knew he’d never again be without his semuta.\nNefud nodded. “My Lord knows l'Il devote myself entirely to his safety.”\n“Yes. Well, to business. | suspect the Duke had something in his mouth. You will find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped him put it there. You'll take every precaution—”\nHe broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the corridor behind him—guards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the lift.\nThe Baron couldn’t place the colonel bashar’s face: thin with mouth like a slash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes.\n“Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion- eaters!” the man roared, and he dashed the guards aside.\nAh-h-h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thought.\nThe colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to slits of apprehension. The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease. They all seemed to look like relatives of the Duke...the late Duke. And their manners with the Baron!\nThe colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron, hands on hips. The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.\nThe Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukar’s manner, and his unease grew. There was only the one legion of them locally—ten brigades—reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but the Baron did not fool himself. That one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and overcoming them.\n“Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron,” the Sardaukar growled. “My men brought you the Atreides Duke before | could discuss his fate with you. We will discuss it now.”\nI must not lose face before my men, the Baron thought.\n“So?” It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.\n“My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly without agony,” the colonel bashar said.\n“Such were the Imperial orders to me,” the Baron lied. “Did you think I’d disobey?”\n“I’m to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes,” the Sardaukar said.\n“The Duke’s already dead,” the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss the fellow.\nThe colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron. Not by flicker of eye or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed. “How?” he growled.\nReally! the Baron thought. This is too much.\n“By his own hand, if you must know,” the Baron said. “He took poison.”\n“I will see the body now,” the colonel bashar said.\nThe Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his thoughts raced. Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a thing’s been changed!\n“Now,” the Sardaukar growled. “I'll see it with my own eyes.”\nThere was no preventing it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see all. He’d know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men...that the Baron most likely had escaped by a narrow margin. There was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the table, and the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him.\nNo preventing it at all.\n“I'll not be put off,” the colonel bashar snarled.\n“You're not being put off,” the Baron said, and he Stared into the Sardaukar’s obsidian eyes. “I hide nothing from my Emperor.” He nodded to Nefud. “The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in by the door where you stood, Nefud.”\n“This way, sir,” Nefud said.\nSlowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way through the guardsmen.\nInsufferable, the Baron thought. Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped up. He'll recognize it as a sign of weakness.\nAnd it was agonizing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were alike in their disdain for weakness. The Baron chewed at his lower lip, consoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the Atreides raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Harkonnen spice stores there.\nDamn that slippery Duke!\nThe Baron watched the retreating backs—the arrogant Sardaukar and the stocky, efficient Nefud.\nWe must adjust, the Baron thought. /’// have to put Rabban over this damnable planet once more. Without restraint. | must soend my own Harkonnen blood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for\naccepting Feyd-Rautha. Damn that Piter! He would get himself killed before | was through with him.\nThe Baron sighed.\nAnd I must send at once to Tleielax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly have the new one ready for me by now.\nOne of the guardsmen beside him coughed.\nThe Baron turned toward the man. “I am hungry.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“And | wish to be diverted while you’re clearing out that room and studying its secrets for me,” the Baron rumbled.\nThe guardsman lowered his eyes. “What diversion does m’Lord wish?”\n“FIL be in my sleeping chambers,” the Baron said. “Bring me that young fellow we bought on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. | don’t feel like wrestling.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\nThe Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor-buoyed pace toward his chambers. Yes, he thought. The one with the lovely eyes, the one who looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.\nO Seas of Caladan,\nO people of Duke Leto— Citadel of Leto fallen, Fallen forever...\n—FROM “SONGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nD aul felt that all his past, every experience before this night, had become sand curling in an hourglass. He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a small fabric and plastic hutment—a stilltent —that had come, like the Fremen clothing they now wore, from the pack left in the 'thopter.\nThere was no doubt in Paul’s mind who had put the Fremkit there, who had directed the course of the 'thopter carrying them captive.\nYueh.\nThe traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of Duncan Idaho.\nPaul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed rocks that ringed this place where Idaho had hidden them.\nHiding like a child when I’m now the Duke, Paul thought. He felt the thought gall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did.\nSomething had happened to his awareness this night—he saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him. He felt unable to stop the inflow of data or the cold precision\nwith which each new item was added to his knowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness. It was Mentat power and more.\nPaul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange ‘thopter dived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert with wind screaming through its wings. The thing in Paul’s mind had happened then. The ‘thopter had Skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running figures—his mother and himself. Paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur from abrasion of ’thopter skids against sand had drifted across them.\nHis mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of Harkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the ‘thopter’s open door shouting: “Hurry! There’s wormsign south of you!”\nBut Paul had known as he turned who piloted the ‘thopter. An accumulation of minutiae in the way it was flown, the dash of the landing—clues so small even his mother hadn’t detected them—had told Paul precisely who sat at those controls.\nAcross the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: “There can be only one explanation. The Harkonnens held Yueh’s wife. He hated the Harkonnens! | cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the carnage?”\nShe is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a shock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.\n“Do not try to forgive me,” Yueh had written. “I do not want your forgiveness. | already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without malice or hope of another’s understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my ultimate test. | give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that | write truly.

The Harkonnens held Yueh’s wife. He hated the Harkonnens! | cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the carnage?”\nShe is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a shock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.\n“Do not try to forgive me,” Yueh had written. “I do not want your forgiveness. | already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without malice or hope of another’s understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my ultimate test. | give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that | write truly. By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead. Take consolation from my assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with him.”\nIt had not been addressed or signed, but there’d been no mistaking the familiar scrawl—Yueh’s.\nRemembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment—a thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mental alertness. He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words, but had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.\n| loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. / should mourn him. | should feel something.\nBut he felt nothing except: Here’s an important fact.\nIt was one with all the other facts.\nAll the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating, computing.\nHalleck’s words came back to Paul: “Mood’s a thing for cattle or for making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood.”\nPerhaps that’s it, Paul thought. /’// mourn my father later...when there’s time.\nBut he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that his new awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing. The sense of terrible purpose he’d first experienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam pervaded him. His right hand—the hand of remembered pain— tingled and throbbed.\nIs this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.\n“For a while, | thought Hawat had failed us again,” Jessica said. “I thought perhaps Yueh wasn’t a Suk doctor.”\n“He was everything we thought him...and more,” Paul said. And he thought: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, “If Idaho doesn’t get through to Kynes, we'll be—”\n“He’s not our only hope,” she said.\n“Such was not my suggestion,” he said.\nShe heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across the gray darkness of the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette against moon- frosted rocks seen through the tent’s transparent end.\n“Others among your father’s men will have escaped,” she said. “We must regather them, find—” “We will depend upon ourselves,” he said. “Our immediate concern is our family atomics. We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them\nout.”\n“Not likely they'll be found,” she said, “the way they were hidden.”\n“It must not be left to chance.”\nAnd she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet and its spice—that’s what he has in mind. But all he can hope for then is escape into renegade anonymity.\nHis mother’s words had provoked another train of thought in Paul—a duke’s concern for all the people they’d lost this night. People are the true strength of a Great House, Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat’s words: “Parting with people is a sadness; a place is only a place.”\n“They’re using Sardaukar,” Jessica said. “We must wait until the Sardaukar have been withdrawn.”\n“They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar,” Paul said. “They intend that there be no Atreides survivors—total extermination. Do not count on any of our people escaping.”\n“They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperor's part in this.”\n“Can't they?”\n“Some of our people are bound to escape.”\n“Are they?”\nJessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son’s voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did. She had helped train the intelligence which did this, but now she found herself fearful of it. Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.\nThis is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought. “A time of love and a time of grief.” She rested her hand\non her abdomen, awareness focused on the embryo there. / have the Atreides daughter | was ordered to produce, but the Reverend Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldn’t have saved my Leto. This child ts only life reaching for the future in the midst of death. I conceived out of instinct and not out of obedience.\n“Try the communinet receiver again,” Paul said.\nThe mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.\nJessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch. A green light glowed on the instrument’s face. Tinny screeching came from its speaker. She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands. A voice speaking Atreides battle language came into the tent.\n“...back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no Survivors in Carthag and the Guild Bank has been sacked.”\nCarthag! Jessica thought. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.\n“They’re Sardaukar,” the voice said. “Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides uniforms. They’re....”\nA roaring filled the speaker, then silence.\n“Try the other bands,” Paul said.\n“Do you realize what that means?” Jessica asked.\n“I expected it. They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their bank. With the Guild against us, we’re trapped on Arrakis. Try the other bands.”\nShe weighed his words: / expected it. What had happened to him? Slowly, Jessica returned to the instrument. As she moved the bandslide, they caught glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in\nmod\nAtreides battle language: “...fall back.... regroup at....” “...trapped in a cave at....”\nAnd there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen gibberish that poured from the other bands. Sharp commands, battle reports. There wasn’t enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but the tone was obvious.\nHarkonnen victory.\nPaul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle there. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His left hand felt the sphincter-seal of the tent’s entrance. “It’ll be dawn soon,” he said. “We can wait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night. In the desert, you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day.”\nRemembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica’s mind: Without a stillsuit, a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to maintain body weight. She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.\n“If we leave here, Idaho can’t find us,” she said.\n“There are ways to make any man talk,” he said. “If Idaho hasn’t returned by dawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured. How long do you think he could hold out?”\nThe question required no answer, and she sat in silence.\n„try to\nPaul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab and magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages: “literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit repkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt-plugs, paracompass, maker hooks, thumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar....”\nSo many things for survival on the desert.\nPresently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor.\n“Where can we possibly go?” Jessica asked.\n“My father spoke of desert power,” Paul said. “The Harkonnens cannot rule this planet without it. They’ve never ruled this planet, nor shall they. Not even with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar.”\n“Paul, you can’t think that—”\n“We've all the evidence in our hands,” he said. “Right here in this tent—the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites. We know that—”\n“What’ve weather satellites to do with it?” she asked. “They couldn’t possibly....” She broke off.\nPaul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing on minutiae. “You see it now,” he said. “Satellites watch the terrain below. There are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection.”\n“You're suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?”\nShe was so slow.\n“No!” he said. “The Fremen! They’re paying the Guild for privacy, paying in a coin that’s freely available to anyone with desert power—spice. This is more than a second-approximation answer; it’s the Straight-line computation. Depend on it.”\n“Paul,” Jessica said, “you're not a Mentat yet; you can’t know for sure how—”\n“I'll never be a Mentat,” he said. “I’m something else...a freak.”\n“Paul! How can you say such—”\n“Leave me alone!”\nHe turned away from her, looking out into the night. Why can’t I mourn? he wondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it would be denied him forever.\nJessica had never heard such distress tn her son’s voice. She wanted to reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him—but she sensed there was nothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.\nThe glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught her eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: “Manual of ‘The Friendly Desert,’ the place full of life. Here are the ayat and burhan of Life. Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you.”\nIt reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?\nPaul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: “Think of all these special- application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled\nsophistication. Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected.”\nHesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: “Muad’Dib: The Mouse,” and noted that the tail pointed north.\nPaul stared into the tent’s darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his mother revealed by the manual’s glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my father’s wish, he thought. / must\n######################\nOutput:",

Now is the time to carry out my father’s wish, he thought. / must give her his message now while she has time for grief. Grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself Shocked by precise logic.\n“Mother,” he said.\n“Yes?”\nShe heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the sound. Never had she heard such harsh control.\n“My father is dead,” he said.\nShe searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact—the Bene Gesserit way of assessing data—and it came to her: the sensation of terrifying loss.\nJessica nodded, unable to speak.\n“My father charged me once,” Paul said, “to give you a message if anything happened to him. He feared you might believe he distrusted you.”\nThat useless suspicion, she thought.\n“He wanted you to know he never suspected you,” Paul said, and explained the deception, adding: “He wanted you to know he always trusted you\ncompletely, always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regret—that he never made you his Duchess.”\nShe brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste of the body’s water! But she knew this thought for what it was—the attempt to retreat from grief into anger. Leto, my Leto, she thought. What terrible things we do to those we love! With a violent motion, she extinguished the little manual’s glowtab.\nSobs shook her.\nPaul heard his mother’s grief and felt the emptiness within himself. / have no grief, he thought. Why? Why? He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw.\n“A time to get and time to lose,” Jessica thought, quoting to herself from the O.C. Bible. “A time to keep and a time to cast away, a time for love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace.”\nPaul’s mind had gone on in its chilling precision. He saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery—as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.\nAbruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Paul’s mind climbed another notch in awareness. He felt himself clinging to this new level, clutching ata precarious hold and peering about. It was as though\nhe existed within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions...yet this only approximated the sensation.\nHe remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.\nHe saw people.\nHe felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.\nHe knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of innumerable unexplored crannies. There was time to probe and test and taste, but no time to shape.\nThe thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote future—from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his own death in countless ways. He saw new planets, new cultures.\nPeople.\nPeople.\nHe saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.\nEven the Guildsmen.\nAnd he thought: The Guild—there’d be a way for us, my strangeness accepted as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the now-necessary spice.\nBut the idea of living out his life in the mind- groping-ahead-through-possible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him. It was a way, though. And in meeting the possible future that\ncontained Guildsmen he recognized his own strangeness.\n| have another kind of sight. | see another kind of terrain: the available paths.\nThe awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm—so many places on that other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.\nAs swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.\nYet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a terrifying way. He stared around him.\nNight still covered the stilltent within its rock- enclosed hideaway. His mother’s grief could still be heard.\nHis own lack of grief could still be felt...that hollow place somewhere separated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace—dealing with data, evaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.\nAnd now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had encompassed. But this made the empty place within him no easier to bear. He felt that something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him. It went on about its business no matter what he wanted. It recorded minuscule shadings of difference around him—a slight change in moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across their stilltent roof, the\nsolemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of sky he could see out the tent’s transparent end.\nThe emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in motion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the start of it—the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible at a critical moment...and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he could look ahead—the most terrifying direction—to see where it all pointed.\nl'm a monster! he thought. A freak!\n“No,” he said. Then: “No. No! NO!”\nHe found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists. (The implacable part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into computation.)\n“Paul!”\nHis mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering at him. “Paul, what’s wrong?”\n“You!” he said.\n“l'm here, Paul,” she said. “It’s all right.”\n“What have you done to me?” he demanded.\nIn a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: “I gave birth to you.”\nIt was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in the new way by his onflowing\nmind, the clues added to other data, and a final- summation answer put forward.)\n“Let go of me,” he said.\nShe heard the tron in his voice, obeyed. “Do you want to tell me what’s wrong, Paul?”\n“Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?” he asked.\nThere’s no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: “I hoped the thing any parent hopes—that you’d be...superior, different.”\n“Different?”\nShe heard the bitterness in his tone, said: “Paul, |\n”\n“You didn’t want a son!” he said. “You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You wanted a male Bene Gesserit!”\nShe recoiled from his bitterness. “But Paul....”\n“Did you ever consult my father in this?”\nShe spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: “Whatever you are, Paul, the heredity is as much your father as me.”\n“But not the training,” he said. “Not the things that...awakened...the sleeper.”\n“Sleeper?”\n“It’s here.” He put a hand to his head and then to his breast. “In me. It goes on and on and on and on and—”\n“Paul!”\nShe had heard the hysteria edging his voice.\n“Listen to me,” he said. “You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my dreams: You listen in her\nplace now. I’ve just had a waking dream. Do you know why?”\n“You must calm yourself,” she said. “If there’s—”\n“The spice,” he said. “It’s in everything here—the air, the soil, the food, the geriatric spice. It’s like the Truthsayer drug. It’s a poison!”\nShe stiffened.\nHis voice lowered and he repeated: “A poison—so subtle, so insidious...so irreversible. It won’t even kill you unless you stop taking it. We can’t leave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us.”\nThe terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.\n“You and the spice,” Paul said. “The spice changes anyone who gets this much of it, but thanks to you, | could bring the change to consciousness. | don’t get to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out. | can see it.”\n“Paul, you—”\n“I see it!” he repeated.\nShe heard madness in his voice, didn’t know what to do.\nBut he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: “We’re trapped here.”\nWe're trapped here, she agreed.\nAnd she accepted the truth of his words. No pressure of the Bene Gesserit, no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the Spice was addictive. Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.\nSo here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell planet. The place is prepared for us, if we can\nevade the Harkonnens. And there’s no doubt of my course: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit Plan.\n“I must tell you about my waking dream,” Paul said. (Now there was fury in his voice.) “To be sure you accept what I say, l'II tell you first | know you'll bear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis.”\nJessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against the curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear. She knew her pregnancy could not show yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first faint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.\n“Only to serve,” Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto. “We exist only to serve.”\n“We'll find a home among the Fremen,” Paul said, “where your Missionaria Protectiva has bought us a bolt hole.”\nThey’ve prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself. But how can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.\nHe studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light.

But how can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.\nHe studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light. A beginning of compassion for her crept over him.\n“The things that can happen here, | cannot begin to tell you,” he said. “I cannot even begin to tell myself, although I’ve seen them. This sense of the future—I seem to have no control over it. The thing just happens. The immediate future—say, a year—I\ncan see some of that...a road as broad as our Central Avenue on Caladan. Some places | don’t see... Shadowed places...as though it went behind a hill” (and again he thought of the surface of a blowing kerchief) “...and there are branchings....”\nHe fell silent as memory of that see/ng filled him. No prescient dream, no experience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the veils had been ripped away to reveal naked time.\nRecalling the experience, he recognized his own terrible purpose—the pressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble...time retreating before it....\nJessica found the tent’s glowtab control, activated it.\nDim green light drove back the shadows, easing her fear. She looked at Paul’s face, his eyes—the inward stare. And she knew where she had seen such a look before: pictured in records of disasters—on the faces of children who experienced starvation or terrible injury. The eyes were like pits, mouth a Straight line, cheeks indrawn.\nIt’s the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the knowledge of his own mortality.\nHe was, indeed, no longer a child.\nThe underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing all else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them.\n“There’s a way to evade the Harkonnens,” she said.\n“The Harkonnens!” he sneered. “Put those twisted humans out of your mind.” He stared at his mother, Studying the lines of her face in the light of the glowtab. The lines betrayed her.\nShe said: “You shouldn’t refer to people as humans without—”\n“Don’t be so sure you know where to draw the line,” he said. “We carry our past with us. And, mother mine, there’s a thing you don’t know and should— we are Harkonnens.”\nHer mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation. But Paul’s voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging her with it.\n“When next you find a mirror, study your face— study mine now. The traces are there if you don’t blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones. And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I’ve walked the future, I’ve looked ata record, I’ve seen a place, | have all the data. We’re Harkonnens.”\n“A...cenegade branch of the family,” she said. “That’s it, isn’t it? Some Harkonnen cousin who—”\n“You're the Baron’s own daughter,” he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. “The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you.”\nThe way he said you struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past\nreached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted—it wasn’t to end the old Atreides- Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their lines. What? She groped for an answer.\nAs though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: “They thought they were reaching for me. But I’m not what they expected, and I’ve arrived before my time. And they don’t know it.”\nJessica pressed her hands to her mouth.\nGreat Mother! He’s the Kwisatz Haderach!\nShe felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with eyes from which little could be hidden. And that, she knew, was the basis of her fear.\n“You're thinking I’m the Kwisatz Haderach,” he said. “Put that out of your mind. I’m something unexpected.”\nI must get word out to one of the schools, she thought. The mating index may show what has happened.\n“They won't learn about me until it’s too late,” he said.\nShe sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: “We'll find a place among the Fremen?”\n“The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai- hulud, Old Father Eternity,” he said. “They say: ‘Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.’”\nAnd he thought: Yes, mother mine—among the Fremen. You'll acquire the blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit...and you'll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife.\n“If you're not the Kwisatz Haderach,” Jessica said, “what—”\n“You couldn't possibly know,” he said. “You won’t believe it until you see it.”\nAnd he thought: /’m a seed.\nHe suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the empty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.\nHe had seen two main branchings along the way ahead—in one he confronted an evil old Baron and said: “Hello, Grandfather.” The thought of that path and what lay along it sickened him.\nThe other path held long patches of gray obscurity except for peaks of violence. He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the universe with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor. Gurney Halleck and a few others of his father’s men— a pitiful few—were among them, all marked by the hawk symbol from the shrine of his father’s skull.\n“I can’t go that way,” he muttered. “That’s what the old witches of your schools really want.”\n“I don’t understand you, Paul,” his mother said.\nHe remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose. He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their\nbloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.\nSurely, | cannot choose that way, he thought.\nBut he saw again in his mind’s eye the shrine of his father’s skull and the violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.\nJessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence. “Then...the Fremen will give us sanctuary?”\nHe looked up, staring across the green-lighted tent at the inbred, patrician lines of her face. “Yes,” he said. “That’s one of the ways.” He nodded. “Yes. They'll call me...Muad’Dib, ‘The One Who Points the Way.’ Yes...that’s what they'll call me.”\nAnd he closed his eyes, thinking: Now, my father, | can mourn you. And he felt the tears coursing down his cheeks.\nBOOK TWO MUAD’DIB\nWhen my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto’s death and the manner of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed the Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said | was a witch like all the others. And when | sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self- preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if | thought him a weakling. | saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty. As | look back on it, | think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad’Dib’s shared common ancestry.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad N ow Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen,” Paul whispered.\nHe had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent. As he spoke, he heard the vague stirrings of his mother where she slept against the tent’s opposite wall.\nPaul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor, studying the dials illuminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes.\n“It should be night soon,” his mother said. “Why don’t you lift the tent shades?”\nPaul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time, that she had lain silent in the darkness until certain he was awake.\n“Lifting the shades wouldn't help,” he said. “There’s been a storm. The tent’s covered by sand. l'Il dig us out soon.”\n“No sign of Duncan yet?”\n“None.”\nPaul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb, and a sudden rage against the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set him trembling.\n“I heard the storm begin,” Jessica said.\nThe undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm. His mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of their stilltent—cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and tails furrowing the sky. He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape under the blast, becoming a low, cheddar-colored wedge. Sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.\nTent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then—silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface.\n“Try the receiver again,” Jessica said.\n“No use,” he said.\nHe found his stillsuit’s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen existence—living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.\nJessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept\n######################\nOutput:",

Sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.\nTent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then—silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface.\n“Try the receiver again,” Jessica said.\n“No use,” he said.\nHe found his stillsuit’s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen existence—living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.\nJessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must guard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent’s catchpockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.\nSo much easier to drift back down into sleep.\nBut there had been a dream in this day’s sleep, and she shivered at memory of it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been written: Duke Leto Atreides. The name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.\nThe sand would not stop.\nHer dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing—part of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little more than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.\nMy unknown mother, Jessica thought. The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave me to the Sisters because that’s what she was commanded to do. Was she glad to rid herself of a Harkonnen child?\n“The place to hit them is in the spice,” Paul said.\nHow can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself.\n“An entire planet full of spice,” she said. “How can you hit them there?”\nShe heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor.\n“It was sea power and air power on Caladan,” he said. “Here, it’s desert power. The Fremen are the key.”\nHis voice came from the vicinity of the tent’s sphincter. Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.\nAll his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thought. Now, he finds he is Harkonnen...because of me. How little he knows me! I was my Duke’s only woman. I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene Gesserit orders.\nThe tent’s glowtab came alight under Paul’s hand, filled the domed area with green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desert—forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted. Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away.\n“Secure yourself for the open,” he said, and his voice was blurred behind the filter.\nJessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she watched Paul break the tent seal.\nSand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A\nhole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface.\nWhat will we find out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don’t know?\nShe thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers.\nShe felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter. “Pass up the pack.” It was Paul’s voice, low and\nguarded.\nShe moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.\n“Here,” he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.\nNow she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger Stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.\n“Hurry up,” Paul said. “I want to collapse the tent.”\nA shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. How much sand will the hand hold? she asked herself.\n“Shall | help you?” Paul asked.\n“No.”\nShe swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed sand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took her arm. She stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their basin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther darkness with her trained senses.\nNoise of small animals.\nBirds.\nA fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.\nPaul collapsing their tent, recovering it up the hole.\nStarlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace. She looked at patches of blackness.\nBlack is a blind remembering, she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.\nPresently, Paul stood beside her, said: “Duncan told me that if he was captured, he could hold out... this long. We must leave here now.” He shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert.\nJessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son’s orbit.\nFor now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This world has emptied me of all\nbut the oldest purpose: tomorrow's life. | live now for my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.\nShe felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Paul’s side.\nHe looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.\nThe faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined by stars. The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi- Shaped upthrusting at the stern.\nAn orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare.\nAnother line of purple!\nAnd another upthrusting orange glare!\nIt was like an ancient naval battle, remembered Shellfire, and the sight held them staring.\n“Pillars of fire,” Paul whispered.\nA ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock. Lines of purple laced the sky.\n“Jetflares and lasguns,” Jessica said.\nThe dust-reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their left and they saw a storm trail there—a ribbon of movement over the desert.\n“It must be Harkonnen ‘thopters hunting us,” Paul said. “The way they’re cutting up the desert...it’s as though they were making certain they stamped out whatever’s there...the way you’d stamp out a nest of insects.”\n“Or a nest of Atreides,” Jessica said.\n“We must seek cover,” Paul said. “We’ll head south and keep to the rocks. If they caught us in the\nopen....” He turned, adjusting the pack to his Shoulders. “They’re killing anything that moves.”\nHe took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, heard the low hiss of gliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.\nMy father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. “Something cannot emerge from nothing,” he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable “the truth” can be.\n—FROM “CONVERSATIONS WITH MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad | ‘ve always prided myself on seeing things the\nway they truly are,” Thufir Hawat said. “That’s the curse of being a Mentat. You can’t stop analyzing your data.”\nThe leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke. His sapho-stained lips were drawn into a Straight line with radial creases Spreading upward.\nA robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved by the words.\nThe two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow sink. Dawn was Spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin, touching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and penetrating chill left over from the night. There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him among the few troopers remaining in his force.\nThe man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the sink in the first\nlight of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into the dunes, his movements barely discernible.\nThe Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there. It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. “There are many Harkonnen patrols,” he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.\nHawat nodded.\nMany patrols. Yes.\nBut still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled. Mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.\nThis had been the worst night of Hawat’s life. He had been at Tsimpo, a garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the reports of attack began arriving. At first, he’d thought: /t’s a raid. The Harkonnens are testing.\nBut report followed report—faster and faster.\nTwo legions landed at Carthag.\nFive legions—fifty brigades!—attacking the Duke’s main base at Arrakeen.\nA legion at Arsunt.\nTwo battle groups at Splintered Rock.\nThen the reports became more detailed—there were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers— possibly two legions of them. And it became clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb Intelligence.\nHawat’s shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of his Mentat\ncapabilities. The size of the attack struck his mind like a physical blow.\nNow, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows.\nThe size of the attack.\nHe had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the Guild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of House-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to transport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they’d expected no more than ten brigades.\nBut there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last count—not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors\n######################\nOutput:",

There was no doubt in his mind who had betrayed them—the Lady Jessica. She fitted all the facts available.\n“Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler friends,” the Fremen said.\n“Good.”\nSo Gurney will get off this hell planet. We’re not all gone.\nHawat glanced back at the huddle of his men. He had started the night just past with three hundred of his finest. Of those, an even twenty remained and half of them were wounded. Some of them slept now, Standing up, leaning against the rock, sprawled on the sand beneath the rock. Their last ‘thopter, the one they’d been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded, had given out just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces, then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin.\nHawat had only a rough idea of their location— some two hundred kilometers southeast of Arrakeen. The main traveled ways between the Shield Wall sietch communities were somewhere south of them.\nThe Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin forehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and mustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.\nThe man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his nose.\n“If you cross the sink here this night,” the Fremen said, “you must not use shields. There is a break in\nthe wall....” He turned on his heels, pointed south. “... there, and it is open sand down to the erg. Shields will attract a....” He hesitated. “...worm. They don’t often come in here, but a shield will bring one every time.”\nHe said worm, Hawat thought. He was going to say something else. What? And what does he want of us?\nHawat sighed.\nHe could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease.\nThose damnable Sardaukar!\nWith a self-accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldier-fanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented. His own Mentat assessment of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this treachery before the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.\n“Do you wish to go to the smugglers?” the Fremen asked.\n“Is it possible?”\n“The way is long.”\n“Fremen don’t like to say no,” Idaho had told him once.\nHawat said: “You haven’t yet told me whether your people can help my wounded.”\n“They are wounded.”\nThe same damned answer every time!\n“We know they’re wounded!” Hawat snapped. “That’s not the—”\n“Peace, friend,” the Fremen cautioned. “What do your wounded say? Are there those among them who can see the water need of your tribe?”\n“We haven't talked about water,” Hawat said. “We\n”\n“I can understand your reluctance,” the Fremen said. “They are your friends, your tribesmen. Do you have water?”\n“Not enough.”\nThe Fremen gestured to Hawat’s tunic, the skin exposed beneath it. “You were caught in-sietch, without your suits. You must make a water decision, friend.”\n“Can we hire your help?”\nThe Fremen shrugged. “You have no water.” He glanced at the group behind Hawat. “How many of your wounded would you spend?”\nHawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their communication was out of phase. Word-sounds were not being linked up here in the normal manner.\n“lam Thufir Hawat,” he said. “I can speak for my Duke. | will make promissory commitment now for your help. | wish a limited form of help, preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance.”\n“You wish our siding in a vendetta?”\n“The vendetta l'Il handle myself. | wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that | may get about it.”\nThe Fremen scowled. “How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are their own responsibility.\nThe water’s at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would you have me take that decision away from you?”\nThe man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.\nHawat tensed, wondering: /s there betrayal here?\n“What do you fear?” the Fremen demanded.\nThese people and their disconcerting directness! Hawat spoke cautiously. “There’s a price on my head.”\n“Ah-h-h-h.” The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. “You think we have the Byzantine corruption. You don’t know us. The Harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us.”\nBut they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships, Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.\n“We both fight Harkonnens,” Hawat said. “Should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?”\n“We are sharing,” the Fremen said. “I have seen you fight Harkonnens. You are good. There’ve been times I’d have appreciated your arm beside me.”\n“Say where my arm may help you,” Hawat said.\n“Who knows?” the Fremen asked. “There are Harkonnen forces everywhere. But you still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded.”\nI must be cautious, Hawat told himself. There’s a thing here that’s not understood.\nHe said: “Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?”\n“Stranger-thinking,” the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone. He pointed to the northwest across the clifftop. “We watched you come across the sand last night.” He lowered his arm. “You keep your force on the slip-face of the dunes. Bad. You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long.”\n“The ways of Arrakis don’t come easily,” Hawat said.\n“Truth. But we’ve killed Harkonnens.”\n“What do you do with your own wounded?” Hawat demanded.\n“Does a man not know when he is worth saving?” the Fremen asked. “Your wounded know you have no water.” He tilted his head, looking sideways up at Hawat. “This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and unwounded must look to the tribe’s future.”\nThe tribe’s future, Hawat thought. The tribe of Atreides. There’s sense in that. He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.\n“Have you word of my Duke or his son?”\nUnreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat’s. “Word?”\n“Their fate!” Hawat snapped.\n“Fate is the same for everyone,” the Fremen said. “Your Duke, it is said, has met his fate. As to the Lisan al-Gaib, his son, that is in Liet’s hands. Liet has not Said.”\n| knew the answer without asking, Hawat thought.\nHe glanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard. They were staring out across the sand, the realization in their expressions: there\nwas no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.\nHawat turned back to the Fremen. “Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?”\n“He was in the great house when the shield went down,” the Fremen said. “This I’ve heard...no more.”\nShe dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens, he thought. / was the one who sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it meant turning also against her own son? But...who knows how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks...if you can Call it thinking?\nHawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. “When will you hear about the boy?”\n“We know little of what happens in Arrakeen,” the Fremen said. He shrugged. “Who knows?”\n“You have ways of finding out?”\n“Perhaps.” The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose. “Tell me, Thufir Hawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons the Harkonnens used?”\nThe artillery, Hawat thought bitterly. Who could have guessed they’d use artillery in this day of shields?\n“You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves,” he said. “I’ve...theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons.”\n“Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die,” the Fremen said.\n“Why do you ask about these weapons?”\n“Liet wishes it.”\nIs that what he wants from us? Hawat wondered. He said: “Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?”\n“Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.”\n“Then you should just go take one,” Hawat sneered.\n“Yes,” the Fremen said. “We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar can study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he wishes. But | doubt he'll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis.”\n“You...took one?” Hawat asked.\n“It was a good fight,” the Fremen said. “We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.”\nThere were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!\n“We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. “Some of those are good fighters.”\nOne of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. “Are you talking about Sardaukar?”\n“He’s talking about Sardaukar,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar!” the Fremen said, and there appeared\n######################\nOutput:",

This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!\n“We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. “Some of those are good fighters.”\nOne of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. “Are you talking about Sardaukar?”\n“He’s talking about Sardaukar,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar!” the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice. “Ah-h-h, so that’s what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?”\n“We...don’t know,” Hawat said.\n“Sardaukar,” the Fremen mused. “Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that not strange?”\n“The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,” Hawat said.\n“But you know they are Sardaukar.”\n“Who am I?” Hawat asked bitterly.\n“You are Thufir Hawat,” the man said matter-of- factly. “Well, we would have learned it in time. We’ve sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet’s men.”\nHawat’s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: “You...captured Sardaukar?”\n“Only three of them,” the Fremen said. “They fought well.”\nIf only we’d had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. /f only we could’ve trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we’d have had!\n“Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen said. “If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved.”\n“I serve the...Lisan al-Gaib,” Hawat said. “His welfare is my concern. I’ve pledged myself to this.”\n“You are pledged to his water?”\nHawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his attention to the squatting figure. “To his water, yes.”\n“You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?”\n“To...yes, to the place of his water.”\n“Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?” The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly.\nHawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among the men.\nThe Fremen said: “There is always a way to water.”\nBehind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat’s aide called: “Thufir! Arkie just died.”\nThe Fremen put a fist to his ear. “The bond of water! It’s a sign!” He stared at Hawat. “We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall | call my men?”\nThe aide returned to Hawat’s side, said: “Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen. They're... well, you know how it is at a time like this.”\nThe Fremen still held his fist to his ear. “Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?” he demanded.\nHawat’s mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen’s words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it.\n“The bond of water,” Hawat said.\n“Let our tribes be joined,” the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.\nAs though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with\nhim along the cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.\nIt was over before Hawat’s tired men could gather their wits. The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.\nOne of Hawat’s men shouted: “Where they going with Arkie? He was—”\n“They're taking him to...bury him,” Hawat said.\n“Fremen don’t bury their dead!” the man barked. “Don’t you try any tricks on us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of—”\n“Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen said. “If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures.”\nBut Hawat’s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a lasgun. He started to draw it.\n“Stop right where you are!” Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles. “These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but the meaning’s the same.”\n“They're going to render Arkie down for his water,” the man with the lasgun snarled.\n“Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?” the Fremen asked.\nHe doesn’t even see the problem, Hawat thought. The naïveté of the Fremen was frightening.\n“They’re concerned for a respected comrade,” Hawat said.\n“We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,” the Fremen said. “This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man’s flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.”\nHawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. “Will you now help our wounded?”\n“One does not question the bond,” the Fremen said. “We will do for you what a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and see to the necessities.”\nThe man with the lasgun hesitated.\nHawat’s aide said: “Are we buying help with Arkie’s...water?”\n“Not buying,” Hawat said. “We've joined these people.”\n“Customs differ,” one of his men muttered.\nHawat began to relax.\n“And they'll help us get to Arrakeen?”\n“We will kill Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. He grinned. “And Sardaukar.” He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: “An aircraft comes. Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless.”\nAt a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.\nThe Fremen took Hawat’s arm, pressed him back with the others. “We will fight in the time of fighting,” the man said. He reached beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.\nHawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.\nThe Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the animal’s head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bat’s upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen’s opened hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat’s head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.\nThe bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.\nThe Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his head, listening. “They quarter the high country,” he said. “One wonders who they seek up there.”\n“It’s known that we retreated in this direction,” Hawat said.\n“One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,” the Fremen said. “Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.”\nTime passed.\nSome of Hawat’s men stirred, whispering.\n“Remain silent as frightened animals,” the Fremen hissed.\nHawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff —flitting blurs of tan on tan.\n“My little friend carried his message,” the Fremen said. “He is a good messenger—day or night. I'll be unhappy to lose that one.”\nThe movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing\nremained but the growing pressure of the day’s heat —blurred columns of rising air.\n“Be most silent now,” the Fremen whispered.\nA file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.\nA “thwok-thwok” of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawat’s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them—an Atreides ‘thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The ’thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink.\nThe group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.\nThe ‘thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the ‘thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of Shields and, in their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.\n“Aiinh! They use their stupid shields,” the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.\n“They are Sardaukar,” Hawat whispered.\n“Good.”\nThe Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.\nAbruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the ornithopter, then\nin it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion.\nPresently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.\n“They left only three men in their ‘thopter,” the Fremen beside Hawat said. “That was fortunate. | don’t believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.”\nBehind Hawat, one of his men whispered: “Those were Sardaukar!”\n“Did you notice how well they fought?” the Fremen asked.\nHawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they fought well, indeed.”\nThe captured ‘thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\nSo these Fremen can handle ‘thopters, too, Hawat thought.\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once...twice.\n“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. Il’d hoped to\n######################\nOutput:",

He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they fought well, indeed.”\nThe captured ‘thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\nSo these Fremen can handle ‘thopters, too, Hawat thought.\nOn the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once...twice.\n“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. Il’d hoped to have us away without more inconvenience.”\nInconvenience! Hawat thought.\nHe saw two more 'thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue—the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms— remained at the scene of violence.\nAnother ‘thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it—a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load—like a giant bird coming to its nest.\nIn the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving ‘thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.\n“The cowards!” the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.\nThe troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue- clad bodies. Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.\nHawat’s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a ‘thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the Sky. It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving ‘thopter plunged.\nA flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion ‘thopters had been—everything there caught in the flame.\nIt was the Fremen who took off in that captured ‘thopter, Hawat thought. He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are these Fremen?\n“A reasonable exchange,” said the Fremen beside Hawat. “There must’ve been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and\nmake plans to get another aircraft.” He started to step out of their rock-shadowed concealment.\nA rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.\nA thrown knife caught Hawat’s Fremen companion in the throat, hurling him backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.\nMuad’Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad’Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us “The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.” And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning “That path leads ever down into stagnation.”\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mother’s arm, snapped: “Don’t move!”\nThen he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.\n“It’s Idaho,” he breathed.\nThe craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest. Idaho was out of his ‘thopter and running toward them before the dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy-bearded Kynes.\n“This way!” Kynes called and he veered left.\nBehind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.\nIdaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. “M’Lord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we—”\n“What about that back there?”\nPaul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff —the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.\nA rare smile touched Idaho’s round, placid face. “M’Lord...Sire, I’ve left them a little sur—”\nGlaring white light filled the desert—bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had Paul’s arm in one hand, Jessica’s shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated.\nIdaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.\n“Not the family atomics!” Jessica said. “I thought\n”\n“You planted a shield back there,” Paul said.\n“A big one turned to full force,” Idaho said. “A lasgun beam touched it and....” He shrugged.\n“Subatomic fusion,” Jessica said. “That’s a dangerous weapon.”\n“Not weapon, m’Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time.”\nThe Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low voice: “We should get\nunder cover, friends.”\nPaul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.\n“That blast wi// attract considerable attention, Sire,” Idaho said.\nSire, Paul thought.\nThe word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been his father.\nHe felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools.\n“May | take your pack, Sire?” Idaho asked.\n“It’s not heavy, Duncan,” Paul said.\n“You have no body shield,” Idaho said. “Do you wish mine?” He glanced at the distant cliff. “Not likely there'll be any more lasgun activity about.”\n“Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me.”\nJessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.\nThe Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.\n“This way,” one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.\nBehind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner, found another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.\nKynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.\nIn the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping these people? It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done. It could doom me with them.\nThen he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be assumed—the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth—and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.\nJessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way —a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.\n“This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases,” Paul said.\nHis father wanted! Kynes thought.\nAnd again Kynes wondered at himself: Am / foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It'd be so\neasy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with them.\nPaul followed his mother’s example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the bench— dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them. An ozone smell permeated the place.\nSome of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds Started there—machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives.\nPaul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with Small animals in them stacked against the wall.\n“You've recognized this place correctly,” Kynes said. “For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?”\n“To make this planet a fit place for humans,” Paul said.\nPerhaps that’s why I help them, Kynes thought.\nThe machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.\nPaul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.\nA Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: “Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working. | am unable to mask us from proximity detectors.”\n“Can you repair it?” Kynes asked.\n“Not quickly. The parts....” The man shrugged.\n“Yes,” Kynes said. “Then we'll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the Surface.”\n“Immediately.” The man hurried away.\nKynes turned back to Paul. “You gave a good answer.”\nJessica marked the easy rumble of the man’s voice. It was a royal voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.\n“We're most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,” she said.\n“Mm-m-m, we'll see,” Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. “Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.”\n“At once, Liet,” the man said.\nKynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. “If you please?”\nJessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho\n######################\nOutput:",

She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here.\nThe passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door as she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.\nPaul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He heard the door close behind him, studied the place—about eight meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on their right. A low desk with milk\nglass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the room’s center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.\nKynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the way her son examined the room.\nPaul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room’s air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing cabinets.\n“Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?” Kynes asked.\nHow carefully he avoids my title, Paul thought. But he accepted the chair, remained silent while Kynes sat down.\n“You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise,” Kynes said. “Yet, as you see, the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the Spice!”\nPaul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. “Do you see this ring?”\n“Yes.”\n“Do you know its significance?”\nJessica turned sharply to stare at her son.\n“Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen,” Kynes said. “You are technically the Duke.”\n“l'm a soldier of the Imperium,” Paul said, “technically a hatchetman.”\nKynes’ face darkened. “Even with the Emperor’s Sardaukar standing over your father’s body?”\n“The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another,” Paul said.\n“Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority,” Kynes said.\nAnd Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: There’s steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of...and we’ve need of steel. Paul’s doing a dangerous thing.\nPaul said: “The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved Emperor feared my father. Now, / will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear the—”\n“Lad,” Kynes said, “there are things you don’t—”\n“You will address me as Sire or my Lord,” Paul said.\nGently, Jessica thought.\nKynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologist’s face, the touch of humor there.\n“Sire,” Kynes said.\n“lam an embarrassment to the Emperor,” Paul said. “I am an embarrassment to all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil. As | live, | shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!”\n“Words,” Kynes said.\nPaul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: “You have a legend of the Lisan al-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen to paradise. Your men have—”\n“Superstition!” Kynes said.\n“Perhaps,” Paul agreed. “Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings.”\n“You have a plan,” Kynes said. “This much is obvious... Sire.”\n“Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?”\n“Quite likely.”\n“The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here,” Paul said. “Perhaps even Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before the Landsraad. Let him answer there where—”\n“Paul!” Jessica said.\n“Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case,” Kynes said, “there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the Great Houses.”\n“Chaos,” Jessica said.\n“But I’d present my case to the Emperor,” Paul said, “and give him an alternative to chaos.”\nJessica spoke in a dry tone: “Blackmail?”\n“One of the tools of statecraft, as you've said yourself,” Paul said, and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. “The Emperor has no sons, only daughters.”\n“You'd aim for the throne?” Jessica asked.\n“The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium Shattered by total war,” Paul said. “Planets blasted, disorder everywhere—he'll not risk that.”\n“This is a desperate gamble you propose,” Kynes Said.\n“What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?” Paul asked. “They fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis—the Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That’s why there is a\nLandsraad. This is the glue of the Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.”\n“But they’re—”\n“This is what they fear,” Paul said. “Arrakis would become a rallying cry. Each of them would see himself in my father—cut out of the herd and killed.”\nKynes spoke to Jessica: “Would his plan work?”\n“I’m no Mentat,” Jessica said.\n“But you are Bene Gesserit.”\nShe shot a probing stare at him, said: “His plan has good points and bad points...as any plan would at this stage. A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.”\n““Law is the ultimate science,’” Paul quoted. “Thus it reads above the Emperor’s door. | propose to show him law.”\n“And I’m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,” Kynes said. “Arrakis has its own plan that we—”\n“From the throne,” Paul said, “I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the wave of a hand. This is the coin | offer for your support.”\nKynes stiffened. “My loyalty’s not for sale, Sire.”\nPaul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul’s lips and he said: “Well spoken. | apologize.”\nKynes met Paul’s stare and, presently, said: “No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you’re not like them, Atreides.”\n“It could be a fault in their education,” Paul said. “You say you're not for sale, but I believe I’ve the coin you'll accept. For your loyalty | offer my loyalty to you...totally.”\nMy son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought. He has that tremendous, almost naive honor—and what a powerful force that truly is.\nShe saw that Paul’s words had shaken Kynes.\n“This is nonsense,” Kynes said. “You’re just a boy and—”\n“I’m the Duke,” Paul said. “I’m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond.”\nKynes swallowed.\n“When I say totally,” Paul said, “I mean without reservation. | would give my life for you.”\n“Sire!” Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a Superior. Now Kynes meant the word.\nIn this moment he’d give his life for Paul, she thought. How do the Atreides accomplish this thing so quickly, so easily?\n“I know you mean this,” Kynes said. “Yet the Harkon—”\nThe door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence—shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing in the passage.\nWith his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking the passage, his blood- pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the orange fire-mouth of a\nstunner repelled by the shield. Idaho’s blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.\nThen Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.\nPaul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen uniforms—his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.\n“I appear to’ve decided,” Kynes said.\n“Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down,” Paul said. He pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.\n“I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,” Kynes said.\n“You've a bolt hole out of here,” Paul said. “Shall we use it?”\nKynes took a deep breath, said: “This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.”\n“They'll not use a lasgun for fear we've shields on this side,” Paul said.\n“Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,” Jessica whispered.\nThey could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.\nKynes indicated the cabinets against the right- hand wall, said: “This way.” He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel. “This door also is plasteel,” Kynes said.\n“You were well prepared,” Jessica said.\n“We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,” Kynes said. He herded them into the darkness, closed the door.\nIn the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her.\nKynes’ voice came from behind them: “We'll separate here. This wall is tougher. It'll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that one on the floor. They'll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to another exit where I’ve secreted a ‘thopter. There’s a storm across the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing ‘thopters. If you stay high in the storm you'll survive.”\n“What of you?” Paul asked.\n“I'll try to escape another way. If I’m captured... well, I’m still Imperial Planetologist. | can say | was your captive.”\nRunning like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can l live to avenge my father? He turned to face the door.\nJessica heard him move, said, “Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.”\n“FII take full payment for them all one day,” Paul said.\n######################\nOutput:",

If I’m captured... well, I’m still Imperial Planetologist. | can say | was your captive.”\nRunning like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can l live to avenge my father? He turned to face the door.\nJessica heard him move, said, “Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.”\n“FII take full payment for them all one day,” Paul said.\n“Not unless you hurry now,” Kynes said.\nPaul felt the man’s hand on his shoulder.\n“Where will we meet, Kynes?” Paul asked.\n“FIL send Fremen searching for you. The storm’s path is known. Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.”\nThey heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.\nJessica found Paul’s hand, pulled him gently. “We must not get separated,” she said.\n“Yes.”\nHe followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.\nThey crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.\nThey were running now.\nPlans within plans within plans within plans, Jessica thought. Have we become part of someone else’s plan now?\nThe arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up. They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its center.\nPaul pressed the handle.\nThe wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft.\n“Where did Kynes go?” Jessica asked.\n“He did what any good guerrilla leader would,” Paul said. “He separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldn’t reveal where we are if he’s captured. He won't really know.”\nPaul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor.\n“No one’s been here for a long time,” he said.\n“He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,” she said.\n“I share that confidence.”\nPaul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter’s left door, opened it, and secured his pack in the rear. “This ship’s proximity masked,” he said. “Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the Harkonnens taught them to be thorough.”\nJessica leaned against the craft’s other side, catching her breath.\n“The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area,” she said. “They’re not stupid.” She considered her direction sense, pointed right. “The storm we saw Is that way.”\nPaul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the here-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.\n“The longer we wait the better prepared they'll be,” Jessica said.\n“Get in and strap yourself down,” he said.\nHe joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this was blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.\n“If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.” It was a Bene Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into that trap...if he lived through this.\nPaul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate metal interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten for jet-boost takeoff the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were armed. Turbines began their low hissing.\n“Ready?” he asked.\n“Yes.”\nHe touched the remote control for lights.\nDarkness blanketed them.\nHis hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul’s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure.\nA wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door-wall had\nbeen. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.\nPaul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings snapped back and down, hurling the ‘thopter out of its nest. Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.\nJessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the sureness of her son’s movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated. Now, Paul’s training is our only hope, she thought. His youth and swiftness.\nPaul fed more power to the jetpods. The ‘thopter banked, sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave the craft more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining the ribbon trail of the storm.\nPaul’s hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. G-force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.\n“Jetflares behind us!” Jessica said.\n“I saw them.”\nHe slammed the power arm forward.\nTheir ‘thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking beneath the\ndunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows —dunes diminishing one into another.\nAnd above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars.\nSomething jarred the 'thopter.\n“Shellburst!” Jessica gasped. “They’re using some kind of projectile weapon.”\nShe saw a sudden animal grin on Paul’s face. “They seem to be avoiding their lasguns,” he said.\n“But we've no shields!”\n“Do they know that?”\nAgain the ‘thopter shuddered.\nPaul twisted to peer back. “Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us.”\nHe returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.\n“Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry—that’s one thing we'll give the Fremen,” Paul whispered.\n“The storm,” Jessica said. “Hadn’t you better turn?”\n“What about the ship behind us?”\n“He’s pulling up.”\n“Now!”\nPaul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.\nThey appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft became a long,\nhorizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel.\nThrough Jessica’s mind flashed all the warnings about such storms—that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones. She felt the buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls. She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled.\n“Sand!” Jessica shouted.\nShe saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. “Not much sand this high.”\nBut she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.\nPaul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.\nThe sound of their passage diminished.\nThe ‘thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.\nJessica had the eerie feeling that they were Standing still, that all motion was external. A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.\nWinds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour, she thought. Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her. I must not fear, she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer.\nSlowly her long years of training prevailed.\nCalmness returned.\n“We have the tiger by the tail,” Paul whispered. “We can’t go down, can’t land...and | don’t think | can lift us out of this. We'll have to ride it out.”\nCalmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together. Then she heard Paul’s voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:\n“Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me | will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only | will remain.”\nWhat do you despise? By this are you truly known.\n—FROM “MANUAL OF MUAD’DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n“ T hey are dead, Baron,” said lakin Nefud, the guard captain. “Both the woman and the boy are certainly dead.”\nThe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep Suspensors of his private quarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters, though, the ship’s harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects.\n“It is a certainty,” the guard captain said. “They are dead.”\nThe Baron shifted his gross body in the Suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline Statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded Suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\n“They're certainly dead, Baron,” the man repeated.\nThe Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud’s eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep\nwithin the drug’s rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.\n“I have a full report,” Nefud said.\nLet him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear—sharp and\n######################\nOutput:",

Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded Suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\n“They're certainly dead, Baron,” the man repeated.\nThe Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud’s eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep\nwithin the drug’s rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.\n“I have a full report,” Nefud said.\nLet him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear—sharp and ready.\n“Have you seen their bodies?” the Baron rumbled.\nNefud hesitated.\n“Well?”\n“M’Lord...they were seen to dive into a sandstorm...winds over eight hundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m’Lord. Nothing! One of our own craft was destroyed in the pursuit.”\nThe Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the man’s jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.\n“You have seen the bodies?” the Baron asked.\n“M’Lord—”\n“For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?” the Baron roared. “To tell me a thing is certain when it is not? Do you think lIl praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?”\nNefud’s face went bone pale.\nLook at the chicken, the Baron thought. / am surrounded by such useless clods. If | scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he’d peck at it.\n“The man Idaho led us to them, then?” the Baron asked.\n“Yes, m’Lord!”\nLook how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought. He said: “They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Is there more to this...report?”\n“The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, m’Lord. Idaho joined this Kynes under mysterious circumstances...| might even say suspicious circumstances.”\n“Soe”\n“They...ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it’s apparent the boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement of the chase, several of our groups were caught In a lasgun-shield explosion.”\n“How many did we lose?”\n“l’m...ah, not sure yet, m’Lord.”\nHe’s lying, the Baron thought. /t must’ve been pretty bad.\n“The Imperial lackey, this Kynes,” the Baron said. “He was playing a double game, eh?”\n“I'd stake my reputation on it, m’Lord.”\nHis reputation!\n“Have the man killed,” the Baron said.\n“M'Lord! Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majesty’s own serv—”\n“Make it look like an accident, then!”\n“M'Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now.”\n“Get him away from them. Say | wish to question him.”\n“If they demur?”\n“They will not if you handle it correctly.”\nNefud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“The man must die,” the Baron rumbled. “He tried to help my enemies.”\nNefud shifted from one foot to the other.\n“Well?”\n“M’Lord, the Sardaukar have...two persons in custody who might be of interest to you. They’ve caught the Duke’s Master of Assassins.”\n“Hawat? Thufir Hawat?”\n“I’ve seen the captive myself, m’Lord. ’Tis Hawat.”\n“I'd not’ve believed it possible!”\n“They say he was knocked out by a stunner, m’Lord. In the desert where he couldn’t use his Shield. He’s virtually unharmed. If we can get our hands on him, he'll provide great sport.”\n“This is a Mentat you speak of,” the Baron growled. “One doesn’t waste a Mentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat? Could he know the extent of...but no.”\n“He has spoken only enough, m’Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady Jessica was his betrayer.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h.”\nThe Baron sank back, thinking; then: “You’re sure? It’s the Lady Jessica who attracts his anger?”\n“He said it in my presence, m’Lord.”\n“Let him think she’s alive, then.”\n“But, m’Lord—”\n“Be quiet. | wish Hawat treated kindly. He must be told nothing of the late Doctor Yueh, his true betrayer. Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending his\nDuke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, feed his suspicions against the Lady Jessica.\n“M’Lord, | don’t—”\n“The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information. False information—false results.”\n“Yes, m’Lord, but...”\n“Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?”\n“M’Lord, Hawat’s still in the hands of the Sardaukar!”\n“Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from Hawat as | am. I’ve noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud. They’re not very devious...politically. | do believe this is a deliberate thing; the Emperor wants it that way. Yes. | do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.”\nNefud looked unhappy. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“You will tell the Sardaukar commander that | wish to question both Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other. He can understand that much, I think.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“And once we have them in our hands....” The Baron nodded.\n“M’Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any...questioning.”\n“I’m sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud.”\n“I understand, m’Lord. That’s when Kynes can have his accident.”\nn\n“Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will have a real accident. It’s Hawat | want. Yes. Ah, yes.”\nNefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.\n“Hawat will be given both food and drink,” the Baron said. “Treated with kindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries. And you will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawat’s diet from this point on...unless | say otherwise.”\n“The antidote, yes.” Nefud shook his head. “But—”\n“Don’t be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter. | need a replacement.”\n“Hawat?”\n“Hawat.”\n“But—”\n“You're going to say Hawat’s completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he’s not to blame for the Duke’s demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable Thufir Hawat.”\n“Woo him. Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat’s right. Hawat will see a certain element of\ntruth in this. The Duke couldn’t afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information.” The Baron stared at Nefud. “Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud. The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.”\n“With wealth. Yes, m’Lord.”\n“We will woo Hawat,” the Baron said. “We will hide him from the Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve... the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison. There’s no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never suspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.”\nNefud’s eyes opened wide with understanding.\n“The absence of a thing,” the Baron said, “this can be as deadly as the presence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything else we're addicted to.” The Baron nodded. “You understand me, Nefud?”\nNefud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.”\n“At once, m’Lord.” Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.\nHawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If they suspect anything at all it’s that | wish to destroy the Mentat. And this suspicion l'Il confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they'll toss him to me like some\nsilly toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.\nThe Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his Suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.\nAnd all the Atreides dead!\nThe stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter...or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet...all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor's ears alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.\nPower and fear—fear and power!\nThe Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this Rabban he’d summoned, of course. But Rabban’s younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a Sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed...a ferocity.\nA lovely boy, the Baron thought. A year or two more—say, by the time he’s seventeen, l'Il know for certain whether he’s the tool that House Harkonnen requires to gain the throne.\n“M’Lord Baron.”\nThe man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron’s bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line’s narrow-set eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some\nrigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that he’d come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.\nA muscle\n######################\nOutput:",

No Mentat, my nephew...not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he'll grind over everything in his path. Oh, how he'll be hated here on Arrakis!\n“My dear Rabban,” the Baron said. He released the doorfield, but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe.\n“You summoned me,” Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a Suspensor chair, found none.\n“Stand closer where | can see you easily,” the Baron said.\nRabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.\n“The Atreides are dead,” the Baron said. “The last of them. That’s why | summoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again yours.”\nRabban blinked. “But | thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the—”\n“Piter, too, is dead.”\n“Piter?”\n“Piter.”\nThe Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration.\n“You finally tired of him, eh?” Rabban asked.\nHis voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy- blanketed room.\n“I will say a thing to you just this once,” the Baron rumbled. “You insinuate that | obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle.” He snapped fat fingers. “Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. | will take it unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that | am so stupid.”\nFear showed in the squinting of Rabban’s eyes. He knew within certain limits how far the old Baron would go against family. Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments could be painful.\n“Forgive me, m’Lord Baron,” Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience.\n“You do not fool me, Rabban,” the Baron said.\nRabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.\n“| make a point,” the Baron said. “Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for an overriding purpose—and know your purpose!”\nAnger spoke in Rabban: “But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! | saw his body being carried out as | arrived last night.”\nRabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.\nBut the Baron smiled. “I’m very careful about dangerous weapons,” he said. “Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke.” Strength poured into the Baron’s voice. “/suborned a doctor of the Suk\nSchool! The /nner School! You hear, boy? But that’s a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. | didn’t obliterate him casually.”\n“Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?”\nThis was a penetrating question, the Baron thought. Have I misjudged this nephew?\n“The Emperor doesn’t know it yet,” the Baron said. “But his Sardaukar are sure to report it to him. Before that happens, though, l'Il have my own report in his hands through CHOAM Company channels. | will explain that | /ucki/y discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you understand? Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk School, this will be accepted.”\n“Ah-h-h, | see,” Rabban murmured.\nAnd the Baron thought: /ndeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret. The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. Why did | do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine—the nephew I must use and discard? The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.\n“It must be kept secret,” Rabban said. “I understand.”\nThe Baron sighed. “I give you different instructions about Arrakis this time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, | held you in strong rein. This time, | have only one requirement.”\n“M’Lord?”\n“Income.”\n“Income?”\n“Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?”\n“Expensive, eh?”\n“Expensive!”\nThe Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. “If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, you'll just barely repay us!”\nRabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.\n“Expensive,” the Baron sneered. “The damnable Guild monopoly on space would've ruined us if | hadn’t planned for this expense long ago. You should know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar.”\nAnd not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were insidious—bleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and pay and pay.\nAlways, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. “Hazard rates,” the oily Guild agents explained. And for every agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.\nInsufferable!\n“Income then,” Rabban said.\nThe Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. “You must squeeze.”\n“And | may do anything I wish as long as | Squeeze?”\n“Anything.”\n“The cannons you brought,” Rabban said. “Could |\n”\n“l'm removing them,” the Baron said.\n“But you—”\n“You won’t need such toys. They were a special innovation and are now useless. We need the metal. They cannot go against a shield, Rabban. They were merely the unexpected. It was predictable that the Duke’s men would retreat into cliff caves on this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them In.”\n“The Fremen don’t use shields.”\n“You may keep some lasguns if you wish.”\n“Yes, m’Lord. And | have a free hand.”\n“AS long as you squeeze.”\nRabban’s smile was gloating. “I understand perfectly, m’Lord.”\n“You understand nothing perfectly,” the Baron growled. “Let us have that clear at the outset. What you do understand is how to carry out my orders. Has it occurred to you, Nephew, that there are at least five million persons on this planet?”\n“Does m’Lord forget that | was his regent-siridar here before? And if m’Lord will forgive me, his estimate may be low. It’s difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the Fremen of\n”\n“The Fremen aren’t worth considering!”\n“Forgive me, m’Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.”\nThe Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. “You know something?”\n“M'Lord had retired when | arrived last night. I... ah, took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from...ah, before. They’ve been acting as guides to the Sardaukar. They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar force somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out.”\n“Wiped out a Sardaukar force?”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Impossible!”\nRabban shrugged.\n“Fremen defeating Sardaukar,” the Baron sneered.\n“I repeat only what was reported to me,” Rabban said. “It is said this Fremen force already had captured the Duke’s redoubtable Thufir Hawat.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h-h.”\nThe Baron nodded, smiling.\n“I believe the report,” Rabban said. “You’ve no idea what a problem the Fremen were.”\n“Perhaps, but these weren’t Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must’ve been Atreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as Fremen. It’s the only possible answer.”\nAgain, Rabban shrugged. “Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen. The Sardaukar already have launched a program to wipe out all Fremen.”\n“Good!”\n“But—”\n“It'll keep the Sardaukar occupied. And we’ll soon have Hawat. | know it! I can feel it! Ah, this has been a day! The Sardaukar off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize!”\n“M’Lord....” Rabban hesitated, frowning. “I’ve always felt that we underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in—”\n“Ignore them, boy! They’re rabble. It’s the populous towns, cities, and villages that concern us. A great many people there, eh?”\n“A great many, m’Lord.”\n“They worry me, Rabban.”\n“Worry you?”\n“Oh...ninety per cent of them are of no concern. But there are always a few...Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who might try a dangerous thing. If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what happened here, I’d be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I'd be?”\nRabban swallowed.\n“You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor,” the Baron said. “As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was straightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though. That is the Story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.”\n“As the Emperor wishes it,” Rabban said.\n“As the Emperor wishes it.”\n“What about the smugglers?”\n“No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At any rate, you'll be Spreading some bribes in that quarter...and taking other measures which I’m sure you can think of.”\n“Yes, m’Lord.”\n“Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are—slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest\n######################\nOutput:",

Don’t waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy.” He smiled, a baby’s expression in the dimple-fat face. “A Carnivore never stops. Show no mercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst.

His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. “Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You’re forgetting that he’s addicted to the spice.”\n“Of course!”\n“Those who know will do nothing to endanger their Supply,” the Baron said. “Kynes certainly must know.”\n“I forgot,” Rabban said.\nThey stared at each other in silence.\nPresently, the Baron said: “Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of your first concerns.

Really a lovely boy.\nAt the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.\n—FROM “A CHILD'S HISTORY OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nA: Paul fought the ’thopter’s controls, he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional vortex.\nThe cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his inner sense began to see through the curtain.\nI must find the right vortex, he thought.\nFor a long time now he had sensed the storm’s power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.\nThe vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the ‘thopter left.\nJessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.\n“Paul!” she screamed.\nThe vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the ‘thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out—a winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.\nPaul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert— moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.\n“We're out of it,” Jessica whispered.\nPaul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.\n“We've given them the slip,” he said.\nJessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.\nIt was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It’s gone, but we remain.\n“I don’t like the sound of our wing motion,” Paul said. “We suffered some damage in there.”\nHe felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation.\nHe shivered.\nThe sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was the Sspice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the words had a power of their own.\n“| shall not fear...”\nCause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self- awareness that could not have been without the litany’s magic.\nWords from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: “What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?”\n“There’s rock all around,” Jessica said.\nPaul focused on the ‘thopter’s launching, shook his head to clear it. He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm’s doing.\n“Better set us down on sand,” Jessica said. “The wings might not take full brake.”\nHe nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes. “I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your Safety harness.”\nShe obeyed, thinking: We’ve water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we can do.\n“Run for those rocks the instant we’re stopped,” Paul said. “lIl take the pack.”\n“Run for....” She fell silent, nodded. “Worms.”\n“Our friends, the worms,” he corrected her. “They'll get this ’thopter. There'll be no evidence of where we landed.”\nHow direct his thinking, she thought.\nThey glided lower...lower...\nThere came a rushing sense of motion to their passage—blurred shadows of dunes, rocks lifting like islands. The ‘thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.\nHe’s killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence.\n“Brace yourself!” Paul warned.\nHe pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder. He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings’ leaves.\nAbruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the ‘thopter. The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.\nPaul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and out onto the ‘thopter’s metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its straps.\n“Run!” he ordered.\nHe pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.\nJessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune. She heard Paul’s panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.\n“Follow the ridge,” Paul ordered. “It’ll be faster.”\nThey slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.\nA new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering.\n“Worm,” Paul said.\nIt grew louder.\n“Faster!” Paul gasped.\nThe first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.\nPaul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother’s arm with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\n“I can’t run any farther,” Jessica panted.\nPaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in- motion ran parallel to their rock island—moonlit ripples, Sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul’s eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once—a short\nloop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.\nWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\nThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.\n“It’s bigger than a Guild spaceship,” Paul whispered. “I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but |\n######################\nOutput:",

They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.\n“I can’t run any farther,” Jessica panted.\nPaul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in- motion ran parallel to their rock island—moonlit ripples, Sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul’s eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once—a short\nloop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.\nWhere the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.\nThe burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.\n“It’s bigger than a Guild spaceship,” Paul whispered. “I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but | didn’t realize...how big.”\n“Nor |,” Jessica breathed.\nAgain, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curbing track toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them.\nPaul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon- frosted escarpment, and quoted from the Kitab al- Ibar: “Travel by night and rest in black shade through the day.” He looked at his mother. “We still have a few hours of night. Can you go on?”\n“In a moment.”\nPaul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.\n“Whenever you're ready,” he said.\nShe pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. “Which direction?”\n“Where this ridge leads.” He pointed.\n“Deep into the desert,” she said.\n“The Fremen desert,” Paul whispered.\nAnd he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But\nthe set of the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.\nIdaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.\n“Do you see a way to go?” Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.\n“No,” he said. “But we'll go anyway.”\nHe settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a Sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south.\nPaul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.\nShe noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and particular—the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were Slowed, the wind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go over or go around? The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.\n“Careful here—this ledge is slippery with sand.”\n“Watch you don’t hit your head against this overhang.”\n“Stay below this ridge; the moon’s at our backs and it’d show our movement to anyone out there.”\nPaul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.\nJessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It tasted brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan —a tall fountain enclosing a curve of sky, sucha richness of moisture that it hadn’t been noticed for itself...only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside it.\nTo stop, she thought. To rest...truly rest.\nIt occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.\nPaul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping surface. Jessica followed with a sigh.\nThey slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a Sheer rock face. Again, they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.\nJessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in substances beneath their feet and hands—boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.\nThe powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock flakes cut.\nAnd the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.\nPaul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled into him.\nHe was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred meters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves —shadows of angles that lapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment.\n“Open desert,” she said.\n“A wide place to cross,” Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face.\nJessica glanced left and right—nothing but sand below.\nPaul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of shadows in the moon’s passage. “About three or four kilometers across,” he said.\n“Worms,” she said.\n“Sure to be.”\nShe focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. “Shall we rest and eat?”\nPaul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him. She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.\n“Here,” he said.\nHis hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm.\nShe swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.\n“Drink all your water,” Paul said. “Axiom: the best place to conserve your water is in your body. It keeps\nyour energy up. You’re stronger. Trust your stillsuit.”\nShe obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she recalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, “Better a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife.”\nJessica repeated the words to Paul.\n“That was Gurney,” he said.\nShe caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead, thought: And well poor Gurney might be dead. The Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.\n“Gurney always had the right quotation,” Paul said. “I can hear him now: ‘And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.’”\nJessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her son’s voice.\nPresently, Paul said: “How do you...feel?”\nShe recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: “Your sister won’t be born for many months yet. | still feel...physically adequate.”\nAnd she thought: How stiffly formal | speak to my own son! Then, because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she searched and found the source of her formality: /’m afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; | fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.\nPaul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds of the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.\n“There’s melange spice nearby,” he said.\nAn eider wind feathered Paul’s cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose. But this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference.\n“Dawn soon,” he said.\nJessica nodded.\n“There’s a way to get safely across that open sand,” Paul said. “The Fremen do it.”\n“The worms?”\n“If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,” Paul said. “It'd keep a worm occupied for a time.”\nShe glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment. “Four kilometers’ worth of time?”\n“Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that don’t attract the worms....”\nPaul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had come with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive terror at thought of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared...if...if....\nHe shook his head.\n“It'd have to be sounds without rhythm,” Jessica said.\n“What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps...the sand itself must shift down at times. Worms can’t investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested before we try it, though.”\nHe looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the vertical moonshadows there. “It’ll be dawn within the hour.”\n“Where’ll we spend the day?” she asked.\nPaul turned left, pointed. “The cliff curves back north over there. You can see by the way it’s wind-cut that’s the windward face. There'll be crevasses there, deep ones.”\n“Had we better get started?” she asked.\nHe stood, helped her to her feet. “Are you rested enough for a climb down? | want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp.”\n“Enough.” She nodded for him to lead the way.\nHe hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff.\nIf only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. /t’d be such a simple matter to jump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.\nThey came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.\nPaul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world\nof deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The fissure narrowed to some ten meters’ width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.\n“Can we go down?” Jessica whispered.\n“I think so.” He tested the surface with one foot. “We can slide down,” he said. “lIl go first. Wait\nuntil you hear me stop.”\n“Careful,” she said.\nHe stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.\nThere came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away to silence.\n“Mother?” he said.\nThere was no answer.\n“Mother?”\nHe dropped the\n######################\nOutput:",

It trailed away to silence.\n“Mother?” he said.\nThere was no answer.\n“Mother?”\nHe dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging, throwing sand like a wild man. “Mother!” he gasped. “Mother, where are you?”\nAnother cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He wrenched himself out of it.\nShe’s been caught in the sandslide, he thought. Buried in it. | must be calm and work this out carefully. She won't smother immediately. She'll\ncompose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows l'Il dig for her.\nIn the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments could write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed itself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall.\nPresently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig, moving the sand with care not to dislodge another Slide. A piece of fabric came under his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm, exposed her face.\n“Do you hear me?” he whispered.\nNo answer.\nHe dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he detected a slow heartbeat.\nBindu suspension, he told himself.\nHe cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could, feeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with the effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls.\nHe stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert’s marching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.\nShe awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.\n“I knew you'd find me,” she whispered.\nHe looked back up the fissure. “It might have been kinder if | hadn’t.”\n“Paul!”\n“ĮI lost the pack,” he said. “It’s buried under a hundred tons of sand...at least.”\n“Everything?”\n“The spare water, the stilltent—everything that counts.” He touched a pocket. “I still have the paracompass.” He fumbled at the waist sash. “Knife and binoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we'll die.”\nIn that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the open desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks.\nBut Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul’s face. She edged her voice with scorn, said: “Is this the way you were taught?”\n“Don’t you understand?” he asked. “Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand.”\n“You found me,” she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.\nPaul squatted back on his heels.\nPresently, he looked up the fissure at the new Slope, studying it, marking the looseness of the sand.\n“If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a hole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack. Water might do it, but we don’t have enough water for....” He broke off, then: “Foam.”\nJessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind.\nPaul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as his eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them.\n“Spice,” he said. “Its essence—highly alkaline. And | have the paracompass. Its power pack is acid-base.”\nJessica sat up straight against the rock.\nPaul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the desert’s floor.\nShe watched the way he walked, breaking his stride—step...pause, step-step...slide...pause...\nThere was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here.\nPaul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his knife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts on it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism\ncame out next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument.\n“You'll need water,” Jessica said.\nPaul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it into the dished compartment.\nIf this fails, that’s water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won’t matter then, anyway.\nWith his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the water. They foamed Slightly, subsided.\nJessica’s eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of hawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the open water.\nGreat Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!\nPaul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button which gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in one hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying the lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He waded part way up the slope, kicking off the sand rivulets, spurts of dust.\nPresently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass, shook the instrument case.\nGreen foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.\nJessica moved to a position below him, called out: “May | help?”\n“Come up and dig,” he said. “We've about three meters to go. It’s going to be a near thing.” As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.\n“Quickly,” Paul said. “No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.”\nJessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into the hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.\nAs Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the sand down the slope. “How deep?” she panted.\n“About three meters,” he said. “And | can only approximate the position. We may have to widen this hole.” He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand. “Slant your digging backward. Don’t go straight down.”\nJessica obeyed.\nSlowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack.\nCould I have miscalculated? Paul asked himself. I’m the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?\nHe looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained.\nJessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam- stained hand across her cheek. Her eyes met Paul’s. “The upper face,” Paul said. “Gently, now.” He\nadded another pinch of spice to the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica’s hands as she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole.\nOn the second pass, her hands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of Strap with a plastic buckle.\n“Don’t move any more of it,” Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.\n“We're out of foam.”\nJessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.\nPaul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said: “Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I’m going to pull you to the side and downhill. Don’t let go of that strap. We won't get much more spill from the top. This slope has Stabilized itself. All I’m going to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand. Once that hole’s filled, we can dig you out and pull up the pack.”\n“I understand,” she said.\n“Ready?”\n“Ready.” She tensed her fingers on the strap.\nWith one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had subsided, Jessica remained buried to the waist, her left arm and Shoulder still under the sand, her chin protected on a fold of Paul’s robe. Her shoulder ached from the Strain put on it.\n“I still have the strap,” she said.\nSlowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap. “Together,” he said. “Steady pressure. We mustn’t break it.”\nMore sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared the surface, Paul stopped,\nfreed his mother from the sand. Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.\nIn a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them.\nPaul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked to her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand.\n“You look a mess,” he said.\n“You're not so pretty yourself,” she said.\nThey started to laugh, then sobered.\n“That shouldn’t have happened,” Paul said. “I was careless.”\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.\n“I'll put up the tent,” he said. “Better slip off that robe and shake it out.” He turned away, taking the pack.\nJessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.\n“There’s anchor holes in the rock,” Paul said. “Someone's tented here before.”\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place—deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away—far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.\nShe turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere blending with the rock\n######################\nOutput:",

Paul stepped past her, lifting his binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the oil lenses on the other cliff, lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand.\nJessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons.\n“There are growing things over there,” he said.\nJessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul.\n“There,” he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other.\nShe looked where he pointed.\n“Saguaro,” she said. “Scrawny stuff.”\n“There may be people nearby,” Paul said.\n“That could be the remains of a botanical testing Station,” she warned.\n“This is pretty far south into the desert,” he said. He lowered his binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. “This has the feeling of a Fremen place,” he said.\n“Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?” she asked.\n“Kynes promised their help.”\nBut there’s desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. / felt some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.\nShe closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan—she and the Duke Leto, before Paul’s birth. They’d flown over the southern jungles, above the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery—man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder\npoles. And in the sea reaches there’d been the white petals of trimaran dhows.\nAll of it gone.\nJessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass.\nA spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sand-fall was gone, she still heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.\n“Worm,” Paul whispered.\nIt came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored. A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of vision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then it was gone, coursing off to the left.\nThe sound diminished, died.\n“I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,” Paul whispered.\nShe nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of Skyline.\n“When we've rested,” Jessica said, “we should continue with your lessons.”\nHe suppressed a sudden anger, said: “Mother, don’t you think we could do without....”\n“Today you panicked,” she said. “You know your mind and bindu-nervature perhaps better than I do, but you’ve much yet to learn about your body’s prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and | can teach you about this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body. You need review of the hands. We'll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and tip sensitivity.” She turned away. “Come, into the tent, now.”\nHe flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination...that he must agree.\nWhatever has been done to me, I’ve been a party to it, he thought.\nReview of the hand!\nHe looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.\nWe came from Caladan—a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind—we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life—we went soft, we lost our edge.\n—FROM “MUAD'DIB: CONVERSATIONS” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad S o you're the great Gurney Halleck,” the man Said.\nHalleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes that told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space frigate’s master control center—communications and viewscreens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk formed as a wall projection—part of the remaining curve.\n“I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek,” the Smuggler said.\n“Then you're the one | owe thanks for the help we've received,” Halleck said.\n“Ah-h-h, gratitude,” the smuggler said. “Sit down.”\nA ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler\nand scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.\nHalleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family resemblance in the smuggler now —the father’s heavy, overhanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose.\n“Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens,” Halleck said.\n“By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people,” Tuek said.\nAnger overcame part of Halleck’s fatigue. He straightened, said: “Can you name the traitor?”\n“We are not sure.”\n“Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.”\n“Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch...perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive.”\n“I heard.” Halleck took a deep breath. “It appears we've a deal more killing ahead of us.”\n“We will do nothing to attract attention to us,” Tuek said.\nHalleck stiffened. “But—”\n“You and those of your men we’ve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,” Tuek said. “You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can always use good men. We'll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the slightest open move against the Harkonnens.”\n“But they killed your father, man!”\n“Perhaps. And if so, l'Il give you my father’s answer to those who act without thinking: ‘A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool’s wrath Is heavier than them both.’”\n“You mean to do nothing about it, then?” Halleck sneered.\n“You did not hear me say that. | merely say | will protect our contract with the Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other ways of destroying a foe.”\n“Ah-h-h-h-h.”\n“Ah, indeed. If you’ve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But | warn you that you’re probably too late...and we doubt she’s the one you want, anyway.”\n“Hawat made few mistakes.”\n“He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.”\n“You think he’s the traitor?”\nTuek shrugged. “This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the Harkonnens believe it.”\n“You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.”\n“Hints and suggestions...rumors and hunches.”\n“We are seventy-four men,” Halleck said. “If you seriously wish us to enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead.”\n“His body has been seen.”\n“And the boy, too—young Master Paul?” Halleck tried to swallow, found a lump in his throat.\n“According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found.”\n“So the witch is dead then...all dead.”\nTuek nodded. “And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune.”\n“The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?”\n“Yes.”\nIt took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him. He spoke with panting breath: “I’ve a score of my own against Rabban. | owe him for the lives of my family....” He rubbed at the scar along his jaw. “...and for this....”\n“One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely,” Tuek said. He frowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck’s jaw, the sudden withdrawal in the man’s shed-lidded eyes.\n“I know...| know.” Halleck took a deep breath.\n“You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us. There are many places to\n“I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With Rabban here—|I stay.”\n“In your mood, I’m not sure we want you to stay.”\nHalleck stared at the smuggler. “You doubt my word?”\n“NO-O-0....”\n“You’ve saved me from the Harkonnens. | gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no greater reason. III stay on Arrakis—with you...or with the Fremen.”\n“Whether a thought is spoken or not it Is a real thing and it has power,” Tuek said. “You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.”\nHalleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him. “Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?” he murmured.\n“Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come,” Tuek said. “Speed is a device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart—water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.”\nHalleck opened his eyes. “I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”\n“I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow\n######################\nOutput:",

Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart—water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.”\nHalleck opened his eyes. “I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”\n“I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. | can only help you meet today.”\n“Then l'Il accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who—”\n“Listen to me, fighting man,” Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler’s face was suddenly like weathered stone. “My father’s water—l’ll buy that back myself, with my own blade.”\nHalleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the Smuggler reminded him of Duke Leto: a leader of men, Courageous, secure in his own position and his own course. He was like the Duke...before Arrakis.\n“Do you wish my blade beside you?” Halleck asked.\nTuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.\n“Do you think of me as fighting man?” Halleck pressed.\n“You're the only one of the Duke’s lieutenants to escape,” Tuek said. “Your enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him.... You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis.”\n“Ene.\n“We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck,” Tuek said. “Arrakis is our enemy.”\n“One enemy ata time, is that it?”\n“That’s it.”\n“Is that the way the Fremen make out?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“You said | might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the desert, in the open, is that why?”\n“Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man’s land. But | wish to talk more about—”\n“I'm told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,” Halleck said. “But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look.”\n“Rumors!” Tuek sneered. “Do you wish to choose now between me and the Fremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock, our own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few ragged bands that we use as spice-hunters.”\n“But they can kill Harkonnens.”\n“And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down like animals—with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being exterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens.”\n“Was it Harkonnens they killed?” Halleck asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Haven’t you heard that there may’ve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?”\n“More rumors.”\n“But a pogrom—that isn’t like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful.”\n“I believe what | see with my own eyes,” Tuek said. “Make your choice, fighting man. Me or the Fremen. | will promise you sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted.”\nHalleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek’s words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain.\n“Trust your own abilities,” Tuek said. “Whose decisions brought your force through the battle? Yours. Decide.”\n“It must be,” Halleck said. “The Duke and his son are dead?”\n“The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, | incline to trust the Harkonnens.” A grim smile touched Tuek’s mouth. “But it’s about the only trust | give them.”\n“Then it must be,” Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. “I give you my sword.”\n“Accepted.”\n“Do you wish me to persuade my men?”\n“You'd let them make their own decision?”\n“They’ve followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn’t what they thought it’d be. Here, they’ve lost everything except their lives. I'd prefer they decided for themselves now.”\n“Now is no time for you to falter,” Tuek said. “They've followed you this far.”\n“You need them, is that it?”\n“We can always use experienced fighting men...in these times more than ever.”\n“You’ve accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?”\n“I think they'll follow you, Gurney Halleck.”\n“Tis to be hoped.”\n“Indeed.”\n“I may make my own decision in this, then?”\n“Your own decision.”\nHalleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required. “For now, l'Il see to their quarters and well-being,” he said.\n“Consult my quartermaster,” Tuek said. “Drisq is his name. Tell him it’s my wish that you receive every courtesy. l'Il join you myself presently. I’ve some off- Shipments of spice to see to first.”\n“Fortune passes everywhere,” Halleck said.\n“Everywhere,” Tuek said. “A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business.”\nHalleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the office.\nHe found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by Tuek’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air-\nconvection currents. Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls.\nHalleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing—no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.\nThe Atreides training— “We care for our own!’”—it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted. One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck’s nine-string baliset out of its case. The man\nSnapped a Salute, said: “Sir, the medics here say there’s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here—only outpost medicine. Mattal can’t last, they say, and he has a request of you.”\n“What is it?”\nThe lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. “Mattai wants a song to ease his going, sir. He says you'll know the one...he’s asked it of you often enough.” The lieutenant swallowed. “It’s the one called ‘My Woman,’ sir. If you—”\n“I know.” Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone had already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile Casually.\nSeveral of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters. One of the men began\nSinging softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:\n“My woman stands at her window, Curved lines ‘’gainst square glass. Uprais’d arms...bent...downfolded. ’Gainst sunset red and golded— Come to me...\nCome to me, warm arms of my lass. For me...\nFor me, the warm arms of my lass.”\nThe singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter.\nHalleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are seventy-three.\nFamily life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, | think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic- eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and | was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I’m not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new Slave-concubine, then, red- haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer’s muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: “She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift.” You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\naul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in the tent.\nFolds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their Shelter. Away from the setting sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night.\nAnd the flatness.\nHis mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no persuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that horizon—no bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze...only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a Sky of burnished silver-blue.\nWhat if there isn’t one of the abandoned testing stations across there? he wondered. What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?\nWithin the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul. He stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away.\nPresently\n######################\nOutput:",

What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?\nWithin the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul. He stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away.\nPresently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the tent’s catchpocket, and Slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her muscles.\nPaul spoke without turning: “I find myself enjoying the quiet here.”\nHow the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: “The mind can go either direction under stress— toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.”\n“It could be a good life here,” Paul said.\nShe tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the rigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering at the possible futures Paul had glimpsed. One could be alone out here, she thought, without fear of someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.\nShe stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and studied the escarpment across from them. Yes, Saguaro in the arroyos and other spiny growth...and a matting of low grasses, yellow-green in the shadows.\n“I'll strike camp,” Paul said.\nJessica nodded, walked to the fissure’s mouth where she could get a sweep of the desert, and swung her binoculars to the left. A salt pan glared white there with a blending of dirty tan at its edges— a field of white out here where white was death. But the pan said another thing: water. At some time water had flowed across that glaring white. She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose, listened for a moment to the sound of Paul’s movements.\nThe sun dipped lower. Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild color spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed into a toe of darkness testing the sand. Coal-colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night blotted the desert.\nStars!\nShe stared up at them, sensing Paul’s movements as he came up beside her. The desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars. The weight of the day receded. There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.\n“The first moon will be up soon,” Paul said. “The pack’s ready. I’ve planted the thumper.”\nWe could be lost forever in this hellplace, she thought. And no one to know.\nThe night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark.\n“Smell that,” Paul said.\n“I can smell it even through the filter,” she said. “Riches. But will it buy water?” She pointed across the basin. “There are no artificial lights across there.”\n“Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks,” he said.\nA sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon. It lifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its face. Jessica studied the white- silver of sand exposed in the light.\n“| planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse,” Paul said. “Whenever | light its candle it’ll give us about thirty minutes.”\n“Thirty minutes?”\n“Before it starts calling...a...worm.”\n“Oh. I’m ready to go.”\nHe slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their fissure.\nThe night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow...if we’re to have a tomorrow. She shook her head. Why must I be so morbid? | was trained better than that!\nPaul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first soreading dune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him. He heard her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sound—the desert’s own code spelling out its measure of safety.\n“We must walk without rhythm,” Paul said and he called up memory of men walking the sand...both prescient memory and real memory.\n“Watch how | do it,” he said. “This is how Fremen walk the sand.”\nHe stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of it, moved with a dragging pace.\nJessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She saw the sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of sand...like the wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step...drag...drag...step...step...wait...drag...step....\nTime stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer. The one behind still towered high.\n“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”\nIt was a drumming from the cliff behind.\n“The thumper,” Paul hissed.\nIts pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride.\n“Lump...lump...lump...lump....”\nThey moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping. Down and up through spilling dunes: step...drag...wait...step.... Across pea sand that rolled under their feet: drag...wait...step....\nAnd all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.\nThe sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage masked it. But it grew...louder and louder...out of the west.\n“Lump...lump...lump...lump....” drummed the thumper.\nThe hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned their heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.\n“Keep moving,” Paul whispered. “Don’t look back.”\nA grating sound of fury exploded from the rock Shadows they had left. It was a flailing avalanche of noise.\n“Keep moving,” Paul repeating.\nHe saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces—the one ahead and the one behind—appeared equally remote.\nAnd still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night.\nThey moved on and on and on.... Muscles reached a stage of mechanical aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the beckoning escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.\nJessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her will alone kept her walking. Dryness ached in her mouth, but the sounds behind drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuit’s catchpockets.\n“Lump...lump....”\nRenewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper.\nSilence!\n“Faster,” Paul whispered.\nShe nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limits—the unnatural movement....\nThe rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base. He stepped onto it, stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary outthrusting of a foot.\nResonant booming shook the sand around them.\nPaul lurched sideways two steps.\n“Boom! Boom!”\n“Drum sand!” Jessica hissed.\nPaul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around them, the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.\nBehind them, he heard a hissing—like the wind, like a riptide where there was no water.\n“Run!” Jessica screamed. “Paul, run!”\nThey ran.\nDrum sound boomed beneath their feet. Then they were out of it and into pea gravel. For a time, the running was a relief to muscles that ached from unfamiliar, rhnythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here was rhythm. But sand and gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them.\nJessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror.\nPaul dragged her up.\nThey ran on, hand in hand.\nA thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another.\nJessica’s mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.\nThere was another—wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.\nAnother.\nRock!\nShe felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new strength from the firmer footing.\nA deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff anead of them. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole.\nBehind them, the sound of the worm’s passage stopped.\nJessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.\nWhere the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock beach, a silver-gray curve\nbroached from the desert, sending rivers of sand and dust cascading all around. It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing mouth. It was a round, black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.\nThe mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled. Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.\nBack and forth the great mouth wove.\nPaul stilled his breathing.\nJessica crouched staring.\nIt took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the primal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that threatened to fill her mind.\nPaul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a time barrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing revealed to his inner eye. It was as though some step he had taken had plunged him into a well...or into the trough of a wave where the future was invisible. The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.\nInstead of frightening him, the sensation of time- darkness forced a hyper-acceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter...crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim...the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle aldehydes...Acids....\nThe worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A shower of small stones and Sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.\nPaul crowded his mother farther back.\nCinnamon!\nThe smell of it flooded across him.\nWhat has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice.\n“Barrrroooom!”\nIt was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.\nAgain: “Barrrroooom!”\nThe worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes.\n“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”\nAnother thumper! Paul thought.\nAgain it sounded off to their right.\nA shudder passed through the worm.\n######################\nOutput:",

A shower of small stones and Sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.\nPaul crowded his mother farther back.\nCinnamon!\nThe smell of it flooded across him.\nWhat has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice.\n“Barrrroooom!”\nIt was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.\nAgain: “Barrrroooom!”\nThe worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes.\n“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”\nAnother thumper! Paul thought.\nAgain it sounded off to their right.\nA shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand. Only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of a tunnel rearing above the dunes.\nSand rasped.\nThe creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes.\nPaul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons.\nJessica followed, listening: “Lump...lump...lump... lump...lump....”\nPresently the sound stopped.\nPaul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.\nJessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the aftermath of terror. “Has it gone for sure?” she whispered.\n“Somebody called it,” Paul said. “Fremen.”\nShe felt herself recovering. “It was so big!”\n“Not as as big as the one that got our ’thopter.”\n“Are you Sure it was Fremen?”\n“They used a thumper.”\n“Why would they help us?”\n“Maybe they weren’t helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm.”\n“Why?”\nAn answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come. He had a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks in their packs—the “maker hooks.”\n“Why would they call a worm?” Jessica asked.\nA breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from his mother, to look up the cliff. “We'd better find a way up there before daylight.” He pointed. “Those poles we passed—there are more of them.”\nShe looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles—wind-scratched markers—made out the Shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high above them.\n“They mark a way up the cliff,” Paul said. He settled his shoulders into the pack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward.\nJessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.\nUp they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.\nPaul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to slow caution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched away upward, open to the stars at the top. His ears searched, found only sounds he could expect —a tiny spill of sand, an insect brrr, the patter of a Small running creature. He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock beneath a gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for his mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her around.\nThey looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement. “If we could only risk a light,” he whispered.\n“We have other senses than eyes,” she said.\nPaul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other foot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled himself up onto it. He reached back, felt his mother’s arm, tugged at her robe for her to follow.\nAnother step.\n“It goes on up to the top, | think,” he whispered.\nShallow and even steps, Jessica thought. Man- carved beyond a doubt.\nShe followed the shadowy movement of Paul’s progress, feeling out the steps. Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them. The steps\nended in a slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto a shallow, moonlit basin.\nPaul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: “What a beautiful place.”\nJessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him.\nIn spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest, this basin’s beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.\n“Like a fairyland,” Paul whispered.\nJessica nodded.\nSpreading away in front of her stretched desert growth—bushes, cacti, tiny clumps of leaves—all trembling in the moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her left, moon-frosted on her right.\n“This must be a Fremen place,” Paul said.\n“There would have to be people for this many plants to survive,” she agreed. She uncapped the tube to her stillsuit’s catchpockets, sipped at it. Warm, faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how it refreshed her. The tube’s cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it.\nMovement caught Paul’s attention—to his right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them. He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump, pop-hop of tiny motion.\n“Mice!” he hissed.\nPop-hop-hop! they went, into shadows and out.\nSomething fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice. There came a thin screech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.\nWe needed that reminder, Jessica thought.\nPaul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night. The predatory bird—he thought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a stillness to the basin so unuttered that the blue- milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbush. There was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.\n“We'd better find a place to pitch the tent,” he said. “Tomorrow we can try to find the Fremen who—” “Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!”\nIt was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the moment. The voice came from above them and to their right.\n“Please do not run, intruders,” the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into the defile. “If you run you'll only waste your body’s water.”\nThey want us for the water of our flesh! Jessica thought. Her muscles overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal. She pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: Such stealth! | didn’t hear him. And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the Small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.\nAnother voice called from the basin’s rim to their left. “Make it quick, Stil. Get their water and let’s be on our way. We've little enough time before dawn.”\nPaul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic. He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, then fall into the semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction.\nStill, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was blind time, no future he had seen...and they were caught between wild Fremen whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.\nThis Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as “The Pillars of the Universe,” whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by “The Old Man’s Hymn’?\n| drove my feet through a desert\nWhose mirage fluttered like a host.\nVoracious for glory, greedy for danger,\n| roamed the horizons of al-Kulab.\nWatching time level mountains\nIn its search and its hunger for me.\nAnd | saw the sparrows swiftly approach,\nBolder than the onrushing wolf.\nThey spread in the tree of my youth.\n| heard the flock in my branches\nAnd was caught on their beaks and claws!\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe man crawled across a dune top. He was a\nmote caught in the glare of the noon sun. He was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak, his Skin bare to the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows. Beneath the blue-within-blue\neyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks. A matted depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to catchpockets.\nThe man stopped half across the dune crest, arms stretched down the slipface. Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs. Patches of yellow- gray sand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself to his feet, stood there swaying. And even in this almost-random action there remained a trace of once-precise movement.\n“lam Liet-Kynes,” he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known. “I am His Imperial Majesty’s Planetologist,” he whispered, “planetary ecologist for Arrakis. | am steward of this land.”\nHe stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face. His hands dug feebly into the sand.\nI am steward of this sand, he thought.\nHe realized that he was semidelirious, that he should dig himself into the sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it. But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre- Spice pocket somewhere underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.\nHis hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.\nA thought spread across his mind—clear, distinct: The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization— agriculture.\nAnd he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left\n######################\nOutput:",

But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre- Spice pocket somewhere underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.\nHis hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.\nA thought spread across his mind—clear, distinct: The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization— agriculture.\nAnd he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here without water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didn’t. They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the impersonal hands of his planet.\nThe Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought. We don’t die easily. | should be dead now...! will be dead soon...but I can’t stop being an ecologist.\n“The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences.”\nThe voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was dead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before him—his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.\n“Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son,” his father said. “You should’ve known the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke.”\nI’m delirious, Kynes thought.\nThe voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through sand, turning to look in that direction—nothing except a curving stretch of dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.\n“The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for life,” his father said. And the voice came now from his left, from behind him.\nWhy does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn’t he want me to see him?\n“Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life,” his father said. “Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It binds more energy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to organism.”\nWhy does he keep harping on the same subject? Kynes asked himself. / knew that before | was ten.\nDesert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began to circle over him. Kynes Saw a Shadow pass near his hand, forced his head farther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch on silver-blue sky—distant flecks of soot floating above him.\n“We are generalists,” his father said. “You can’t draw neat lines around planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit science.”\nWhat’s he trying to tell me? Kynes wondered. /s there some consequence | failed to see?\nHis cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock odor beneath the pre- spice gasses. From some corner of logic in his mind, a thought formed: Those are carrion-eater birds over me. Perhaps some of my Fremen will see them and come to investigate.\n“To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings,” his father said. “You must cultivate ecological literacy among the people. That’s\nwhy I’ve created this entirely new form of ecological notation.”\nHe’s repeating things he said to me when I was a Child, Kynes thought.\nHe began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: The sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you're hot; the sun is burning the moisture out of your body.\nHis fingers clawed feebly at the sand.\nThey couldn’t even leave me a stillsuit!\n“The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation from living bodies,” his father said.\nWhy does he keep repeating the obvious? Kynes wondered.\nHe tried to think of moisture in the air—grass covering this dune...open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water open to the sky except in text illustrations. Open water...irrigation water...it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing season, he remembered.\n“Our first goal on Arrakis,” his father said, “is grassland provinces. We will start with these mutated poverty grasses. When we have moisture locked in grasslands, we'll move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of water—small at first—and situated along lines of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind steals. We must create a true sirocco—a moist wind—but we will never get away from the necessity for windtraps.”\nAlways lecturing me, Kynes thought. Why doesn’t he shut up? Can't he see I’m dying?\n“You will die, too,” his father said, “if you don’t get off the bubble that’s forming right now deep underneath you. It’s there and you know it. You can smell the pre-spice gasses. You know the little makers are beginning to lose some of their water into the mass.”\nThe thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it now—sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half-plant, half-animal little makers—and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest, pure, liquid, soothing water into....\nA pre-spice mass!\nHe inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him than it had been.\nKynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried flapping of wings.\nThis is spice desert, he thought. There must be Fremen about even in the day sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.\n“Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life,” his father said. “Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement adjust to physical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement now, align it for our purposes.”\n“Shut up, old man,” Kynes muttered.\n“We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet,” his father said. “We must use man as a constructive ecological force—\ninserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place—to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.”\n“Shut up!” Kynes croaked.\n“It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship between worms and spice,” his father said.\nA worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope. A maker’s sure to come when this bubble bursts. But | have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker without hooks?\nHe could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him. Water so near—only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but no way to trap it on the surface and use it.\nKynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his movements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the sensation was remote.\n“The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of native life forms,” his father said. “How strange that so few people ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near- ideal nitrogen-oxygen-CO?2 balance being maintained\nhere in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The energy sphere of the planet is there to see and understand—a relentless process, but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something occupies that gap. Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained. |\nknew the little maker was there, deep in the sand, long before | ever saw it.”\n“Please stop lecturing me, Father,” Kynes whispered.\nA hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold its wings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned the energy to croak at it. The bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.\n“Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets before now,” his father said. “Nature tends to compensate for diseases, to remove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way.”\nThe hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.\nKynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.\n“The historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on Arrakis,” his father said. “You cannot go on forever stealing what you need without regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a planet are written into its economic and political record. We have the record in front of us and our course is obvious.”\nHe never could stop lecturing, Kynes thought. Lecturing, lecturing, lecturing—always lecturing.\nThe hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand, turned its head first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.\n“Arrakis is a one-crop planet,” his father said. “One crop. It Supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It’s the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected.”\n“I’m ignoring you, Father,” Kynes whispered. “Go away.”\nAnd he thought: Surely there must be some of my Fremen near. They cannot help but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to see if there’s moisture available.\n“The masses of Arrakis will Know that we work to make the land flow with water,” his father said. “Most of them, of course, will have only a semimystical understanding of how we intend to do this. Many, not understanding the prohibitive mass-ratio problem, may even think we'll bring water from some other planet rich in it. Let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in us.”\nIn a minute l'Il get up and tell him what I think of him, Kynes thought. Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.\nThe bird took another hop closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand. Two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it.\n“Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,” his father said. “An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must\ndepend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.”\nWhere is my population now when I need it most? Kynes thought. He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a finger’s width toward the nearest hawk. It hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.\n“Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,” his father said. “A planet’s life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric. Vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate. As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become controlling influences in their own right—and we will have to deal with them, too. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the energy surface—only three per cent—to tip the entire structure over into our self\n######################\nOutput:",

He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a finger’s width toward the nearest hawk. It hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.\n“Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,” his father said. “A planet’s life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric.

Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the energy surface—only three per cent—to tip the entire structure over into our self-sustaining system.”\nWhy aren’t you helping me? Kynes wondered. Always the same: when I need you most, you fail me. He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his father’s voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer his demand.\nKynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time while its companions waited in mock indifference. The hawk stopped only a hop away from his hand.\nA profound clarity filled Kynes’ mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential for Arrakis that his father had never seen. The possibilities along that different path flooded through him.\n“No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,” his father said.\nReading my mind! Kynes thought. Wel/.../et him.\nThe messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thought. Nothing can stop them. If the Duke’s son is alive they'll find him and protect him as | have commanded. They may discard the woman, his mother, but they'll save the boy.\nThe hawk took one hop that brought it within Slashing distance of his hand. It tipped its head to examine the supine flesh. Abruptly, it straightened, stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and banked away overhead with its companions behind it.\nThey’ve come! Kynes thought. My Fremen have found me!\nThen he heard the sand rumbling.\nEvery Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous “blow” with a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.\nThe hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. They knew what was happening. Any desert creature would know.\nAnd I am a desert creature, Kynes thought. You see me, Father? I am a desert creature.\nHe felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf him, dragging him down into cool darkness. For a moment, the sensation of coolness and the moisture were blessed relief. Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.\nEven the hawks could appreciate these facts.\nProphecy and prescience—How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered question? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the “wave form” (as Muad’Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond- cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?\n—FROM “PRIVATE REFLECTIONS ON MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nad G et their water,” the man calling out of the\nnight had said. And Paul fought down his fear, glanced at his mother. His trained eyes saw her readiness for battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.\n“It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand,” the voice above them said.\nThat’s the one who spoke to us first, Jessica thought. There are at least two of them—one to our right and one on our left.\n“Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas lele pal hrobas!”\nIt was the man to their right calling out across the basin.\nTo Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training, Jessica recognized the\nspeech. It was Chakobsa, one of the ancient hunting languages, and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the strangers they sought.\nIn the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoopwheel face of the second moon— faintly ivory blue—rolled over the rocks across the basin, bright and peering.\nScrambling sounds came from the rocks—above and to both sides...dark motions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through the shadows.\nA whole troop! Paul thought with a sudden pang.\nA tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his hood.\n“What have we here—jinn or human?” he asked.\nWhen Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, She allowed herself a faint hope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night.\n“Human, | warrant,” the man said.\nJessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the man’s robe. She permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no shields.\n“Do you also speak?” the man asked.\nJessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and voice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and weaknesses.\n“Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?” she demanded.\nThe burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow relaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.\nPaul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each of them a clearer arena of action.\nThe hooded head turned at Paul’s movement, opening a wedge of face to moonlight. Jessica saw a Sharp nose, one glinting eye—dark, so dark the eye, without any white in it—a heavy brown and upturned mustache.\n“A likely cub,” the man said. “If you’re fugitives from the Harkonnens, it may be you’re welcome among us. What is it, boy?”\nThe possibilities flashed through Paul’s mind: A trick? A fact? Immediate decision was needed.\n“Why should you welcome fugitives?” he demanded.\n“A child who thinks and speaks like a man,” the tall man said. “Well, now, to answer your question, my young wali, | am one who does not pay the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why | might welcome a fugitive.”\nHe knows who we are, Paul thought. There’s concealment in his voice.\n“lam Stilgar, the Fremen,” the tall man said. “Does that speed your tongue, boy?”\nIt is the same voice, Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.\n“I know you, Stilgar,” Paul said. “I was with my father in Council when you came for the water of\nyour friend. You took away with you my father’s man, Duncan Idaho—an exchange of friends.”\n“And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,” Stilgar said.\nJessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for attack.\nThe voice from the rocks above them called: “We waste time here, Stil.”\n“This is the Duke’s son,” Stilgar barked. “He’s certainly the one Liet told us to seek.”\n“But...a child, Stil.”\n“The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper,” Stilgar said. “That was a brave crossing he made in the path of sha/-hulud.”\nAnd Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed sentence?\n“We haven't time for the test,” the voice above them protested.\n“Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,” Stilgar said.\nHe’s looking for an omen! Jessica thought.\n“But the woman,” the voice above them said.\nJessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice.\n“Yes, the woman,” Stilgar said. “And her water.”\n“You know the law,” said the voice from the rocks. “Ones who cannot live with the desert—”\n“Be quiet,” Stilgar said. “Times change.”\n“Did Liet command this?” asked the voice from the rocks.\n“You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis,” Stilgar said. “Why do you press me?”\nAnd Jessica thought: Cielago! The clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant bat, a small flying mammal. Voice of the cielago: they had received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself.\n“I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar,” said the voice above them.\n“My duty is the strength of the tribe,” Stilgar said. “That is my only duty. | need no one to remind me of it. This child-man interests me. He is full-fleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the father sun. He has not the eyes of the ibad. Yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of the pans. Nor did his father. How can this be?”\n“We cannot stay out here all night arguing,” said the voice from the rocks. “If a patrol—”\n“I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet,” Stilgar said.\nThe man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their left.\n“The voice of the cielago suggested there’d be value to us in saving you two,” Stilgar said. “I can see possibility in this strong boy-man: he is young and can learn. But what of yourself, woman?” He stared at Jessica.\n| have his voice and pattern registered now, Jessica thought. / could control him with a word, but he’s a strong man...worth much more to us\nunblunted and with full freedom of action.

Are you a Reverend Mother?”\nFor the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered truthfully, “No.”\n“Are you trained in the ways of the desert?”\n“No, but many consider my training valuable.”\n“We make our own judgments on value,” Stilgar said.\n“Every man has the\n######################\nOutput:",

Do you understand? We’d not want your shade to plague us. | will take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my countenance, sanctuary in my tribe. But for you, woman—you understand there is nothing personal in this? It is the rule, Istislah, in the general interest. Is that not enough?”\nPaul took a half-step forward. “What are you talking about?”\nStilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica. “Unless you’ve been deep- trained from childhood to live here, you could bring destruction onto an entire tribe. It is the law, and we cannot carry useless....”\nJessica’s motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground. It was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do, and the obvious slows an opponent’s reactions. It takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that thing is exposed as something unknown. She shifted as she saw his right shoulder drop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position. A turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was against the rocks with the man helpless in front of her.\nAt his mother’s first movement, Paul backed two steps. As she attacked, he dove for shadows. A bearded man rose up in his path, half-crouched, lunging forward with a weapon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the sternum with a straight-hand jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck, relieving him of the weapon as he fell.\nThen Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the weapon tucked into his waist sash. He had recognized it in spite of its unfamiliar shape—a projectile weapon, and that said many things about this place, another clue that shields were not used here.\nThey will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow. She can handle him. | must get to a safe vantage point where | can threaten them and give her time to escape.\nThere came a chorus of sharp spring-clicks from the basin. Projectiles whined off the rocks around him. One of them flicked his robe. He squeezed around a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began inching upward—his\nback against one side, his feet against the other— Slowly, as silently as he could.\nThe roar of Stilgar’s voice echoed up to him: “Get back, you wormheaded lice! She’ll break my neck if you come near!”\nA voice out of the basin said: “The boy got away, Stil. What are we—”\n“Of course he got away, you sand-brained...Ugh-h- h! Easy, woman!”\n“Tell them to stop hunting my son,” Jessica said.\n“They've stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great gods below! Why didn’t you Say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?”\n“Tell your men to fall back,” Jessica said. “Tell them to go out into the basin where I can see them... and you'd better believe that | know how many of them there are.”\nAnd she thought: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-minded as I think him, we have a chance.\nPaul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and look down into the basin. Stilgar’s voice came up to him.\n“And if | refuse? How can you...ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no harm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us, you’re worth ten times your weight of water.”\nNow, the test of reason, Jessica thought. She said: “You ask after the Lisan al-Gaib.”\n“You could be the folk of the legend,” he said, “but l'Il believe that when it’s been tested. All | know now is that you came here with that stupid Duke who....\nAiee-e-e! Woman! | care not if you kill me! He was honorable and brave, but it was stupid to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!”\nSilence.\nPresently, Jessica said: “He had no choice, but we'll not argue it. Now, tell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to bring his weapon to bear on me, or I'll rid the universe of you and take him next.”\n“You there!” Stilgar roared. “Do as she says!”\n“But, Stil—”\n“Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand- brained piece of lizard turd! Do it or l'Il help her dismember you! Can’t you see the worth of this woman?”\nThe man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered his weapon.\n“He has obeyed,” Stilgar said.\n“Now,” Jessica said, “explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of me. | want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake.”\n“When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend with the pan and graben folk,” Stilgar said. “We carry no weapons, for the crysknife is sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirding ability of battle. We’d only heard of it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt what he sees with his own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen. This is a weapon no search could expose.”\nThere was a Stirring in the basin as Stilgar’s words sank home.\n“And if | agree to teach you the...weirding way?”\n“My countenance for you as well as your son.”\n“How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?”\nStilgar’s voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on an edge of bitterness. “Out here, woman, we carry no paper for contracts. We make no evening promises to be broken at dawn. When a man says a thing, that’s the contract. As leader of my people, I’ve put them in bond to my word. Teach us this weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as you wish. Your water shall mingle with our water.”\n“Can you speak for all Fremen?” Jessica asked.\n“In time, that may be. But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen. Here, | promise only secrecy. My people will not speak of you to any other sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your Duke is dead. It is said that you two died ina Mother storm. The hunter does not seek dead game.\nThere’s a safety in that, Jessica thought. But these people have good communications and a message could be sent.\n“| presume there was a reward offered for us,” she said.\nStilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning over in his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands.\nPresently, he said: “I will say it once more: I’ve given the tribe’s word-bond. My people know your worth to us now. What could the Harkonnens give us? Our freedom? Hah! No, you are the taqwa, that which\n”\nbuys us more than all the spice in the Harkonnen coffers.”\n“Then I shall teach you my way of battle,” Jessica said, and she sensed the unconscious ritual-intensity of her own words.\n“Now, will you release me?”\n“So be it,” Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in full view of the bank in the basin. This is the test-mashed, she thought. But Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.\nIn the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of where his mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathing, suddenly stilled, above him in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint shadow there outlined against the stars.\nStilgar’s voice came up from the basin: “You, up there! Stop hunting the boy. He'll come down presently.”\nThe voice of a young boy or a girl sounded from the darkness above Paul: “But, Stil, he can’t be far from—”\n“I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!”\nThere came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: “Call me spawn of a lizard!” But the shadow pulled back out of view.\nPaul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed movement of Stilgar beside his mother.\n“Come in, all of you,” Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. “And now l'Il ask you how we may be certain\nyou'll fulfill your half of our bargain? You’re the ones lived with papers and empty contracts and such as—”\n“We of the Bene Gesserit don’t break our vows any more than you do,” Jessica said.\nThere was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: “A Bene Gesserit witch!”\nPaul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark figure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained immobile, staring at Jessica.\n“It is the legend,” someone said.\n“It was said that the Shadout Mapes gave this report on you,” Stilgar said. “But a thing so important must be tested. If you are the Bene Gesserit of the legend whose son will lead us to paradise....” He shrugged.\nJessica sighed, thinking: So our Missionaria Protectiva even planted religious safety valves all through this hell hole. Ah, well...it’ll help, and that’s what it was meant to do.\nShe said: “The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the binding of karama and jaz, the miracle and the inimitability of the prophecy —this | know. Do you wish a sign?”\nHis nostrils flared in the moonlight. “We cannot tarry for the rites,” he whispered.\nJessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called “Sietch Tabr” on the chart and beside it the notation: “Stilgar.”\n“Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr,” she said.\nThe revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: /f only he knew the tricks we use! She must’ve been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva. These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.\nStilgar shifted uneasily. “We must go now.”\nShe nodded, letting him know that they\n######################\nOutput:",

Do you wish a sign?”\nHis nostrils flared in the moonlight. “We cannot tarry for the rites,” he whispered.\nJessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called “Sietch Tabr” on the chart and beside it the notation: “Stilgar.”\n“Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr,” she said.\nThe revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: /f only he knew the tricks we use! She must’ve been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva. These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.\nStilgar shifted uneasily. “We must go now.”\nShe nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.\nHe looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul crouched. “You there, lad: you may come down now.” He returned his attention to Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: “Your son made an incredible amount of noise climbing. He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but he’s young.”\n“No doubt we have much to teach each other,” Jessica said. “Meanwhile, you’d best see to your companion out there. My noisy son was a bit rough in disarming him.”\nStilgar whirled, his hood flapping. “Where?”\n“Beyond those bushes.” She pointed.\nStilgar touched two of his men. “See to it.” He glanced at his companions, identifying them. “Jamis is missing.” He turned to Jessica. “Even your cub knows the weirding way.”\n“And you'll notice that my son hasn’t stirred from up there as you ordered,” Jessica said.\nThe two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned his attention to Jessica. “The son will take only your orders, eh? Good. He knows discipline.”\n“Paul, you may come down now,” Jessica said.\nPaul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another figure arose from the rocks to face him.\nIn the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul Saw a small figure in Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.\n“lam Chani, daughter of Liet.”\nThe voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.\n“I would not have permitted you to harm my companions,” she said.\nPaul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon’s path and he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that face, the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to stillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this face- from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam: “I will meet her.”\nAnd here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.\n“You were as noisy as Shai-hulud in a rage,” she said. “And you took the most difficult way up here. Follow me; l'Il show you an easier way down.”\nHe scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a tumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks. Paul felt hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.\nThat girl! She was like a touch of destiny. He felt caught up on a wave, in tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits.\nThey stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor.\nJessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: “This will be a good exchange of teachings. | hope you and your people feel no anger at our violence. It seemed...necessary. You were about to... make a mistake.”\n“To save one from a mistake Is a gift of paradise,” Stilgar said. He touched his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon from Paul’s waist with the other, tossed it to a companion. “You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when you’ve earned it.”\nPaul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother’s teaching: “Beginnings are such delicate times.”\n“My son has what weapons he needs,” Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar, forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.\nStilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued— Jamis. The man stood at one side, head lowered, breathing heavily. “You are a difficult woman,” Stilgar said. He held out his left hand to a companion, Snapped his fingers. “Kushti bakka te.”\nMore Chakobsa, Jessica thought.\nThe companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar’s hand. Stilgar ran them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica’s neck beneath her hood, fitted the other around Paul’s neck in the same way.\n“Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka,” he said. “If we become separated, you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar’s sietch. We will talk of weapons another time.”\nHe moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul’s Fremkit pack to one of his men to Carry.\nBakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka—the weeper. She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. Why should weeping unite them? she asked herself.\nStilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: “Chani, take the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of trouble.”\nChani touched Paul’s arm. “Come along, child- man.”\nPaul hid the anger in his voice, said: “My name is Paul. It were well you—”\n“We'll give you a name, manling,” Stilgar said, “in the time of the mihna, at the test of aql.”\nThe test of reason, Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul’s ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and she barked, “My son’s been tested with the gom jabbar!”\nIn the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of them.\n“There’s much we don’t know of each other,” Stilgar said. “But we tarry overlong. Day-sun mustn’t find us in the open.” He crossed to the man Paul had struck down, said, “Jamis, can you travel?”\nA grunt answered him. “Surprised me, he did. \"Twas an accident. | can travel.”\n“No accident,” Stilgar said. “lIl hold you responsible with Chani for the lad’s safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance.”\nJessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with Stilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death in it. And Stilgar had seen fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.\nStilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out. “Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no trace. Extra care—we have two with us who’ve not been trained.” He turned, hand upheld and aimed across the basin. “In squad line with flankers—move out. We must be at Cave of the Ridges before dawn.”\nJessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty Fremen—she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought: They travel as a military company—even the girl, Chani.\nPaul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black feeling at being caught by the girl. In his mind now was the memory called up by his mother’s barked reminder: “My son’s been tested with the gom jabbar!” He found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.\n“Watch where you go,” Chani hissed. “Do not brush against a bush lest you leave a thread to show our passage.”\nPaul swallowed, nodded.\nJessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and Paul’s, marveling at the way the Fremen moved. They were forty people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the place—\nghostly feluccas, their robes flitting through the Shadows. Their destination was Sietch Tabr—Stilgar’s sietch.\nShe turned the word over in her mind: sietch. It was a Chakobsa word, unchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries. Sietch: a meeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of the word and the language were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their encounter.\n“We move well,” Stilgar said. “With Shai-hulud’s favor, we'll reach Cave of the Ridges before dawn.”\nJessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will... and, she admitted it: by the force of elation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed here about the Fremen culture.\nAll of them, she thought, an entire culture trained to military order. What a priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!\nThe Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called “spannungsbogen”—which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.\n—FROM “THE WISDOM OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhey approached Cave of the Ridges at\ndawnbreak, moving through a split in the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it. Jessica Saw Stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began their scrambling climb up the cliff.\nPaul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray-blue sky.\nChani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: “Quickly. It is already light.”\n“The men who climbed above us, where are they going?” Paul whispered.\n“The first daywatch,” she said. “Hurry now!”\nA guard left outside, Paul thought. Wise. But it would’ve been wiser still for us to approach this place in separate bands. Less chance of losing the whole troop. He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and he remembered his father’s fear that the Atreides might become a guerrilla house.\n“Faster,” Chani whispered.\nPaul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought of the words of the sirat from Yueh’s tiny O.C. Bible.\n“Paradise on my right, Hell on my left, and the Angel of Death behind.” He rolled the quotation in his mind.\nThey rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.\n“Quickly!” he hissed. “We're like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us here.”\nPaul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin gray light from somewhere ahead.\n“You can stand up,” she said.\nHe straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a man’s handreach. The troop spread out through shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one\n######################\nOutput:",

The troop spread out through shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their companions. And he noted how she failed to blend with the Fremen even though her garb was identical. The way she moved— such a sense of power and grace.\n“Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child- man,” Chani said. “Here’s food.” She pressed two leaf-wrapped morsels into his hand. They reeked of Spice.\nStilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left. “Get the doorseal in place and see to moisture security.” He turned to another Fremen: “Lemil, get glowglobes.” He took Jessica’s arm. “I wish to show you something, weirding\nwoman.” He led her around a curve of rock toward the light source.\nJessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to the cave, an opening high in a cliff wall—looking out across another basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was shielded by high rock walls. Sparse clumps of plant growth were scattered around It.\nAs she looked at the dawn-gray basin, the sun lifted over the far escarpment illuminating a biscuit- colored landscape of rocks and sand. And she noted how the sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.\nIt’s because we want to hold it back, she thought. Night is safer than day. There came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never see rain. / must suppress such longings, she thought. They're a weakness. | no longer can afford weaknesses.\nStilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin. “There! There you see proper Druses.”\nShe looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliffwall. In spite of the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air. She lifted her binoculars from beneath her robe, focused the oil lenses on the distant people. Kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies.\n“That is home,” Stilgar said. “We will be there this night.” He stared across the basin, tugging at his mustache. “My people stayed out overlate working.\nThat means there are no patrols about. l'Il signal them later and they'll prepare for us.”\n“Your people show good discipline,” Jessica said. She lowered the binoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.\n“They obey the preservation of the tribe,” he said. “It is the way we choose among us for a leader. The leader is the one who is strongest, the one who brings water and security.” He lifted his attention to her face.\nShe returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits, the dust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the catchtube curving down from his nostrils into his stillsuit.\n“Have | compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?” she asked.\n“You did not call me out,” he said.\n“It’s important that a leader keep the respect of his troop,” she said.\n“Isn't a one of those sandlice | cannot handle,” Stilgar said. “When you bested me, you bested us all. Now, they hope to learn from you...the weirding way...and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out.”\nShe weighed the implications. “By besting you in formal battle?”\nHe nodded. “I’d advise you against this because they’d not follow you. You’re not of the sand. They saw this in our night’s passage.”\n“Practical people,” she said.\n“True enough.” He glanced at the basin. “We know our needs. But not many are thinking deep thoughts\nnow this close to home. We've been out overlong arranging to deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed Guild...may their faces be forever black.”\nJessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into his face. “The Guild? What has the Guild to do with your spice?”\n“It’s Liet’s command,” Stilgar said. “We know the reason, but the taste of it sours us. We bribe the Guild with a monstrous payment in spice to keep our Skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of Arrakis.”\nShe weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. “And what is it you do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?”\n“We change it...slowly but with certainty...to make it fit for human life. Our generation will not see it, nor our children nor our children’s children nor the grandchildren of their children...but it will come.” He stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. “Open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits.”\nSo that’s the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thought. And she said: “Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger.”\n“They grow,” he said, “but the slow way is the Safe way.”\nJessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way Stilgar was seeing it in his imagination. She saw only the grayed mustard stain of distant\nrocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs.\n“Ah-h-h-h,” Stilgar said.\nShe thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a mirage—another landscape hovering over the desert-sand and a distant wavering of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with what looked like Fremen robes fluttering on its back.\nThe mirage faded.\n“It would be better to ride,” Stilgar said, “but we cannot permit a maker into this basin. Thus, we must walk again tonight.”\nMaker—their word for worm, she thought.\nShe measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not permit a worm into this basin. She knew what she had seen in the mirage— Fremen riding on the back of a giant worm. It took heavy control not to betray her shock at the implications.\n“We must be getting back to the others,” Stilgar said. “Else my people may suspect | dally with you. Some already are jealous that my hands tasted your loveliness when we struggled last night in Tuono Basin.”\n“That will be enough of that!” Jessica snapped.\n“No offense,” Stilgar said, and his voice was mild. “Women among us are not taken against their will... and with you....” He shrugged. “...even that convention isn’t required.”\n“You will keep in mind that | was a duke’s lady,” She said, but her voice was calmer.\n“As you wish,” he said. “It’s time to seal off this opening, to permit relaxation of stillsuit discipline. My people need to rest in comfort this day. Their families will give them little rest on the morrow.”\nSilence fell between them.\nJessica stared out into the sunlight. She had heard what she had heard in Stilgar’s voice—the unspoken offer of more than his countenance. Did he need a wife? She realized she could step into that place with him. It would be one way to end conflict over tribal leadership—female properly aligned with male.\nBut what of Paul then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed here? And what of the unborn daughter she had carried these few weeks? What of a dead Duke’s daughter? And she permitted herself to face fully the significance of this other child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the conception. She knew what it was— She had succumbed to that profound drive shared by all creatures who are faced with death—the drive to seek immortality through progeny. The fertility drive of the species had overpowered them.\nJessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting. A daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man—what would be the fate of such a daughter? she asked herself. Would he try to limit the necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?\nStilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the questions in her mind. “What is important for a leader is that which makes him a leader. It is the needs of his people. If you\nteach me your powers, there may come a day when one of us must challenge the other. | would prefer some alternative.”\n“There are several alternatives?” she asked.\n“The Sayyadina,” he said. “Our Reverend Mother is old.”\nTheir Reverend Mother!\nBefore she could probe this, he said: “I do not necessarily offer myself as mate. This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful and desirable. But should you become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to believe that I’m too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with the tribe’s needs. Even now they listen to us and watch us.”\nA man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought.\n“There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits,” he said. “They must be eased through this period. | must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me. Because | would have to maim and kill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.”\nHis words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened, forced her to reevaluate him.\nHe has stature, she thought. Where did he learn such inner balance?\n“The law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law,” Stilgar said. “But it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs. What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over more land.”\nWhat is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She said: “Stilgar, | underestimated you.”\n“Such was my suspicion,” he said.\n“Each of us apparently underestimated the other,” she said.\n“I should like an end to this,” he said. “I should like friendship with you...and trust. | should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.”\n“I understand,” she said.\n“Do you trust me?”\n“| hear your sincerity.”\n“Among us,” he said, “the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders, hold a special place of honor. They teach. They maintain the strength of God here.” He touched his breast.\nNow I must\n######################\nOutput:",

What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over more land.”\nWhat is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She said: “Stilgar, | underestimated you.”\n“Such was my suspicion,” he said.\n“Each of us apparently underestimated the other,” she said.\n“I should like an end to this,” he said. “I should like friendship with you...and trust. | should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.”\n“I understand,” she said.\n“Do you trust me?”\n“| hear your sincerity.”\n“Among us,” he said, “the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders, hold a special place of honor. They teach. They maintain the strength of God here.” He touched his breast.\nNow I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery, She thought. And she said: “You spoke of your Reverend Mother...and I’ve heard words of legend and prophecy.”\n“It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our future,” he said.\n“Do you believe | am that one?”\nShe watched his face, thinking: The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings are times of such great peril.\n“We do not know,” he said.\nShe nodded, thinking: He’s an honorable man. He wants a sign from me, but he'll not tip fate by telling me the sign.\nJessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows, the purple shadows, the vibrations of dust-mote air across the lip of their cave. Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence. She knew the cant of the Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear and hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes here...as though someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria Protectiva’s imprint.\nStilgar cleared his throat.\nShe sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to seal off this opening. This was a time for boldness on her part, and she realized what she needed: some dar al- hikman, some school of translation that would give her....\n“Adab,” she whispered.\nHer mind felt as though it had rolled over within her. She recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse. Nothing in all the Bene Gesserit training carried such a signal of recognition. It could be only the adab, the demanding memory that comes upon you of itself. She gave herself up to it, allowing the words to flow from her.\n“Ibn qgirtaiba,” she said, “as far as the spot where the dust ends.” She stretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgar’s eyes go wide. She heard a\nrustling of many robes in the background. “I see a... Fremen with the book of examples,” she intoned. “He reads to al-Lat, the sun whom he defied and subjugated. He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads:\n“Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down That did stand in the path of the tempest.\nHast thou not seen what our Lord did?\nHe sent the pestilence among them\nThat did lay schemes against us.\nThey are like birds scattered by the huntsman. Their schemes are like pellets of poison\nThat every mouth rejects.”\nA trembling passed through her. She dropped her arm.\nBack to her from the inner cave’s shadows came a whispered response of many voices: “Their works have been overturned.”\n“The fire of God mount over thy heart,” she said. And she thought: Now, it goes in the proper channel. “The fire of God set alight,” came the response.\nShe nodded. “Thine enemies shall fall,” she said.\n“Bi-la kaifa,” they answered.\nIn the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her. “Sayyadina,” he said. “If the Shai-hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to become a Reverend Mother.”\nPass within, she thought. An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it fitted into the cant well enough. And She felt a cynical bitterness at what she had done. Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was\nprepared for us in this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place. Now...! must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God...Sayyadina to rogue peoples who’ve been so heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they even call their Chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.\nPaul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave. He could still taste the morsel she had fed him—bird flesh and grain bound with spice honey and encased in a leaf. In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten such a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear. He knew what this essence could do to him—the spice change that pushed his mind into prescient awareness.\n“Bi-la kaifa,” Chani whispered.\nHe looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept his mother’s words. Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand aloof from the ceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.\n“Duy yakha hin mange,” Chani whispered. “Duy punra hin mange. | have two eyes. | have two feet.”\nAnd she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.\nPaul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him. His mother’s words had locked onto the working of the spice essence, and he had felt her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire. Through it all, he had sensed the edge of cynicism in her—he knew her so well!—but nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food.\nTerrible purpose!\nHe sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape. There was the sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of his awareness. He sank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it. Awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing the available paths, the winds of the future...the winds of the past: the one-eyed vision of the past, the one-eyed vision of the present and the one-eyed vision of the future—all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to see time-become-space.\nThere was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto his awareness of the present, sensing the blurred deflection of experience, the flowing moment, the continual solidification of that- which-is into the perpetual-was.\nIn grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of time’s movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges, and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs. It gave him a new understanding of his prescience, and he saw the source of blind time, the source of error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.\nThe prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealed—at once a source of accuracy and meaningful error. A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.\nAnd what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—the wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.\nThe vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.\nThe countless consequences—lines fanned out from this cave, and along most of these consequence-lines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a gaping knife wound.\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg’s black helmet with the Imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though. When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but | often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. | think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nof Fremen around her, smelling the acrid stillsuit odor. Her inner timesense told her it would soon be night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space. She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this\n] essica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir\nsuggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within Stilgar’s troop. She turned in the hammock that had been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots.\nI must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit’s pumping action, she thought. There are so many things to remember.\nShe could still taste their morning meal—the morsel of bird flesh and grain bound within a leaf with spice honey—and it came to her that the use of time was turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of rest.\nNight conceals; night is safest.\nShe unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with the fabric in the dark until she found the top, slipped into it.\nHow to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit? she wondered. They would have to be told of the two Strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.\nGlowglobes came alight farther into the cave. She Saw people moving there, Paul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the aquiline Atreides profile.\nHe had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought. Withdrawn. He was like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his eyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare. It made her think of his warning about the spice-impregnated diet: addictive.\nAre there side effects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with his prescient faculty, but he\nhas been strangely silent about what he sees.\nStilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat-stalking look of him.\nAbrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around Paul—the stiff movements, the ritual positions.\n“They have my countenance!” Stilgar rumbled.\nJessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted— Jamis! She saw then the rage in Jamis—the tight set of his shoulders.\nJamis, the man Paul bested! she thought.\n“You know the rule, Stilgar,” Jamis said\n######################\nOutput:",

It made her think of his warning about the spice-impregnated diet: addictive.\nAre there side effects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with his prescient faculty, but he\nhas been strangely silent about what he sees.\nStilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat-stalking look of him.\nAbrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around Paul—the stiff movements, the ritual positions.\n“They have my countenance!” Stilgar rumbled.\nJessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted— Jamis! She saw then the rage in Jamis—the tight set of his shoulders.\nJamis, the man Paul bested! she thought.\n“You know the rule, Stilgar,” Jamis said.\n“Who knows it better?” Stilgar asked, and she heard the tone of placation in his voice, the attempt to smooth something over.\n“I choose the combat,” Jamis growled.\nJessica sped across the cave, grasped Stilgar’s arm. “What is this?” she asked.\n“It is the amtal rule,” Stilgar said. “Jamis is demanding the right to test your part in the legend.” “She must be championed,” Jamis said. “If her champion wins, that’s the truth in it. But it’s said....” He glanced across the press of people. “...that she’d need no champion from the Fremen—which can mean\nonly that she brings her own champion.”\nHe’s talking of single combat with Paul! Jessica thought.\nShe released Stilgar’s arm, took a half-step forward. “I’m always my own champion,” she said.\n“The meaning’s simple enough for....”\n“You'll not tell us our ways!” Jamis snapped. “Not without more proof than I’ve seen. Stilgar could’ve told you what to say last morning. He could’ve filled your mind full of the coddle and you could’ve bird- talked it to us, hoping to make a false way among us.”\n| can take him, Jessica thought, but that might conflict with the way they interpret the legend. And again she wondered at the way the Missionaria Protectiva’s work had been twisted on this planet.\nStilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to the crowd’s fringe. “Jamis is one to hold a grudge, Sayyadina. Your son bested him and—”\n“It was an accident!” Jamis roared. “There was witch-force at Tuono Basin and l'Il prove it now!”\n“and I’ve bested him myself,” Stilgar continued. “He seeks by this tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well. There’s too much of violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader—too much ghafla, the distraction. He gives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarfa, the turning away. No, he could never make a good leader. I’ve preserved him this long because he’s useful in a fight as such, but when he gets this carving anger on him he’s dangerous to his own society.”\n“Stilgar-r-r-r!” Jamis rumbled.\nAnd Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take the challenge away from Paul.\nStilgar faced Jamis, and again Jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling voice. “Jamis, he’s but a boy.\nHe’s—\"\n“You named him a man,” Jamis said. “His mother says he’s been through the gom jabbar. He’s full- fleshed and with a surfeit of water. The ones who carried their pack say there’s literjons of water in it. Literjons! And us sipping our catchpockets the instant they show dewsparkle.”\nStilgar glanced at Jessica. “Is this true? Is there water in your pack?”\n“Yes.”\n“Literjons of it?”\n“Two literjons.”\n“What was intended with this wealth?”\nWealth? she thought. She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice.\n“Where | was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide rivers,” she said. “There were oceans of it so broad you could not see the other Shore. I’ve not been trained to your water discipline. | never before had to think of it this way.”\nA sighing gasp arose from the people around them: “Water fell from the sky...it ran overthe land.” “Did you know there're those among us who've lost from their catchpockets by accident and will be in\nsore trouble before we reach Tabr this night?”\n“How could I know?” Jessica shook her head. “If they’re in need, give them water from our pack.”\n“Is that what you intended with this wealth?”\n“| intended it to save life,” she said.\n“Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina.”\n“You'll not buy us off with water,” Jamis growled. “Nor will you anger me against yourself, Stilgar. | see\nyou trying to make me call you out before I’ve proved my words.”\nStilgar faced Jamis. “Are you determined to press this fight against a child, Jamis?” His voice was low, venomous.\n“She must be championed.”\n“Even though she has my countenance?”\n“I invoke the amtal rule,” Jamis said. “It’s my right.”\nStilgar nodded. “Then, if the boy does not carve you down, you'll answer to my knife afterward. And this time l'Il not hold back the blade as I’ve done before.”\n“You cannot do this thing,” Jessica said. “Paul’s just—”\n“You must not interfere, Sayyadina,” Stilgar said. “Oh, | know you can take me and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but you cannot best us all united. This must be; it is the amtal rule.”\nJessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes, seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his expression. She shifted her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: / should’ve seen that before. He broods. He’s the silent kind, one who works himself up inside. | should’ve been prepared.\n“If you harm my son,” she said, “you'll have me to meet. | call you out now. l'Il carve you into a joint of\n“Mother.” Paul stepped forward, touched her Sleeve. “Perhaps if | explain to Jamis how—”\n“Explain!” Jamis sneered.\nPaul fell silent, staring at the man. He felt no fear of him. Jamis appeared clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their night encounter on the sand. But Paul still felt the nexus-boiling of this cave, still remembered the prescient visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so few avenues of escape for him in that vision....\nStilgar said: “Sayyadina, you must step back now where—”\n“Stop calling her Sayyadina!” Jamis said. “That’s yet to be proved. So she knows the prayer! What’s that? Every child among us knows it.”\nHe has talked enough, Jessica thought. /’ve the key to him. | could immobilize him with a word. She hesitated. But / cannot stop them all.\n“You will answer to me then,” Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in a twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end.\nJamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.\n“I'll teach you agony,” she said in the same tone. “Remember that as you fight. You'll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by comparison. You will writhe with your entire—”\n“She tries a spell on me!” Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist beside his ear. “I invoke the silence on her!”\n“So be it then,” Stilgar said. He cast a warning glance at Jessica. “If you speak again, Sayyadina, we'll know it’s your witchcraft and you'll be forfeit.” He nodded for her to step back.\nJessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they were not unkindly. She saw Paul\nbeing separated from the throng, the elfin-faced Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.\nA ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of them tuned to the yellow band.\nJamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to someone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers. For a moment, he bent with his mouth to his shoulder, drinking from a catchpocket tube. Presently he straightened, peeled off and detached the suit, handed it carefully into the crowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right hand.\nJessica saw the girl-child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the weight and balance. And it came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu, the nerve and the fiber—that he had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in their own lifetimes. The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked Supple and confident.\nBut he’s only fifteen, she thought. And he has no shield. | must stop this. Somehow, there must be a way to.... She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.\n“You cannot stop it,” he said. “You must not Speak.”\nShe put a hand over her mouth, thinking: /’ve planted fear in Jamis’ mind. It’ll slow him some... perhaps. If | could only pray—truly pray.\nPaul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks he’d worn under his stillsuit. He held a crysknife in his right hand; his feet were bare against the sand-gritted rock. Idaho had warned him time and again: “When in doubt of your surface, bare feet are best.” And there were Chani’s words of instruction still in the front of his consciousness: “Jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry. It’s a habit in him we’ve all seen. And he'll aim for the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you. And he can fight either hand; look out for a knife shift.”\nBut strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was training and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after day, hour after hour on the practice floor.\nGurney Halleck’s words were there to remember: “The good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearing-guard simultaneously. The point can also cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent’s blade.”\nPaul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not even know if it could be broken.\nJamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.\nPaul crou\n######################\nOutput:",

The point can also cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent’s blade.”\nPaul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not even know if it could be broken.\nJamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.\nPaul crouched, realizing then that he had no Shield, but was trained to fighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness necessary for penetrating the enemy's shield. In spite of constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shield’s mindless blunting of attack speed, he knew that shield- awareness was part of him.\nJamis called out in ritual challenge: “May thy knife chip and shatter!”\nThis knife will break then, Paul thought.\nHe cautioned himself that Jamis also was without Shield, but the man wasn’t trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.\nPaul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man’s body looked like knotted whipcord on a dried Skeleton. His crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes.\nFear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull yellow light within this ring of people. Prescience had fed his knowledge with countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the strings of decision that guided them, but this was the rea/-now. This was death hanging on an infinite number of minuscule mischances.\nAnything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the troop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in a glowglobe’s brilliance, a deceptive shadow.\nl'm afraid, Paul told himself.\nAnd he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating Silently to himself the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. “Fear is the mind-killer....” It was a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready.\n“I'll sheath my knife in your blood,” Jamis snarled. And in the middle of the last word he pounced.\nJessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.\nWhere the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.\nNow, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind.\nPaul’s motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis the margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.\nPaul withdrew, crouching low. “First, you must find my blood,” he said.\nJessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came over her what a two-edged thing that was. The boy’s reactions were those of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen. But the attack was trained, too, and conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier. A shield would repel too fast a blow, admit only the Slowly deceptive counter. It needed control and trickery to get through a shield.\nDoes Paul see it? she asked herself. He must!\nAgain Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes.\nAnd again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nEach time, Paul’s counterblow came an instant late.\nAnd Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul’s defensive reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis’ blow.\n“Is your son playing with that poor fool?” Stilgar asked. He waved her to silence before she could respond. “Sorry; you must remain silent.”\nNow the two figures on the rock floor circled each other: Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low.\nAgain, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had been dodging.\nInstead of faking back and out, Paul met the man’s knife hand on the point of his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left and thankful for Chani’s warning.\nJamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand. Blood dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His eyes were wide and staring— two blue-black holes—studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes.\n“Ah, that one hurt,” Stilgar murmured.\nPaul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first blood, called out: “Do you yield?”\n“Hah!” Jamis cried.\nAn angry murmur arose from the troop.\n“Hold!” Stilgar called out. “The lad doesn’t know our rule.” Then, to Paul: “There can be no yielding in the tahaddi-challenge. Death is the test of it.”\nJessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: He’s never killed a man like this...in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?\nPaul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis’ movement. The prescient knowledge of the time- boiling variables in this cave came back to plague him now. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself.\nVariable piled on variable—that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in his path. It was like a gigantic rock in the flood, creating maelstroms in the Current around it.\n“Have an end to it, lad,” Stilgar muttered. “Don’t play with him.”\nPaul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.\nJamis backed now that the realization swept over him—that this was no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen crysknife.\nJessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man’s face. Now is when he’s most dangerous, she thought. Now he’s desperate and can do anything. He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.\nAnd she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis— an emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate\nperil to her son.\nJamis could do anything...any unpredictable thing, she told herself. She wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this experience. But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles. And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Paul’s gift.\nPaul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho’s voice flowed through Paul’s awareness: “When your opponent fears you, then’s the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them.”\nThe crowd in the cavern began to mutter.\nThey think Paul’s toying with Jamis, Jessica thought. They think Paul’s being needlessly cruel.\nBut she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of the spectacle. And she could see the pressure building up in Jamis. The moment when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to Jamis...or to Paul.\nJamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the hand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.\nJessica gasped.\nBut Paul had been warned by Chani: “Jamis fights with either hand.” And the depth of his training had taken in that trick en passant. “Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it,” Gurney Halleck had told him time and again. “The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand.”\nAnd Paul had seen Jamis’ mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to confuse Paul and hide the knife shift.\nExcept for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the staring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor. Shields didn’t count where the body’s own movement could be used against it. Paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis’ chest was descending—then away to watch the man crumble.\nJamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass.\n“Killing with the point lacks artistry,” |\\daho had once told Paul, “but don’t let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself.”\nThe troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.\nAnd there was no body on the rock floor.\nJessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a Sea of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.\nNow is the terrible moment, she thought. He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.\nShe forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space where two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into his stillsuit.\nJessica stared at her son. Paul’s eyes were bright. He breathed heavily, permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.\n“Him against Jamis and not a mark on him,” one of the men muttered.\nChani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl’s excitement, the admiration in the elfin face.\nIt must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thought.\nShe compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: “Well-I-l, now—how does it feel to be a killer?”\nPaul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother’s cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.\nStilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: “When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.”\nJessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made—it served a purpose now. She searched\n######################\nOutput:",

He met his mother’s cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.\nStilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: “When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.”\nJessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made—it served a purpose now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw. Admiration, yes, and fear...and in some—loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.\nPaul looked at his mother. “You know what it was,” he said.\nShe heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her glance across the troop, said: “Paul has never before killed a man with a naked blade.”\nStilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.\n“I wasn’t playing with him,” Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother, straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis’ blood on the cavern floor. “I did not want to kill him.”\nJessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering awareness spread through the troop.\n“That’s why y’ asked him to yield,” Stilgar said. “| see. Our ways are different, but you'll see the sense in them. | thought we’d admitted a scorpion into our midst.” He hesitated, then: “And | shall not call you lad the more.”\nA voice from the troop called out: “Needs a naming, Stil.”\nStilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. “I see strength in you...like the strength beneath a pillar.”\nAgain he paused, then: “You shall be known among us as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume...Usul.”\nMurmuring went through the troop: “Good choice, that...strong...bring us luck.” And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.\n“Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.\n“How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?” Paul asked, remembering the pop-hop of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one hand.\nA chuckle sounded through the troop.\n“We call that one muad’dib,” Stilgar said.\nJessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen would accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear of her son and for him.\nPaul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind... yet...there were differences. He could see himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.\nAnd again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib. That must not happen, he told himself.\n“Is that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked.\n“Lam an Atreides,” Paul whispered, and then louder: “It’s not right that | give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could | be known among you as Paul-Muad’Dib?”\n“You are Paul-Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.\nAnd Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine. | did a different thing.\nBut he felt that the abyss remained all around him.\nAgain a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man: “Wisdom with strength...Couldn’t ask more...It’s the legend for sure...Lisan al-Gaib...Lisan al-Gaib....”\n“I will tell you a thing about your new name,” Stilgar said. “The choice pleases us. Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad’Dib creates his own water. Muad’Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad’Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad’Dib we call ‘instructor-of-boys.’ That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul- Muad’Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you.”\nStilgar touched Paul’s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, “Usul.”\nAs Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul, repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone: “Usul...Usul...Usul.” Already, he could place some of them by name. And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.\nPresently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: “Now, you are of the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother.” His face hardened, and he spoke with command in his voice. “And now, Paul-Muad’Dib, tighten up that stillsuit.” He glanced at Chani. “Chani! Paul-Muad’Dib’s nose plugs are as poor a fit I’ve ever seen! | thought | ordered you to see after him!”\n“I hadn’t the makings, Stil,” she said. “There’s Jamis’, of course, but—”\n“Enough of that!”\n“Then l'Il share one of mine,” she said. “I can make do with one until—”\n“You will not,” Stilgar said. “I know there are Spares among us. Where are the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of savages?”\nHands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar selected four, handed them to Chani. “Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina.”\nA voice lifted from the back of the troop: “What of the water, Stil? What of the literjons in their pack?”\n“I know your need, Farok,” Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.\n“Broach one for those that need it,” Stilgar said. “Watermaster...where is a watermaster? Ah,\nShimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed. The necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees.”\n“What is the repayment at field rates?” Jessica asked.\n“Ten for one,” Stilgar said.\n“But—”\n“It’s a wise rule as you'll come to see,” Stilgar said.\nA rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.\nStilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. “As to Jamis,” he said, “I order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his tahaddi-challenge. | invoke the rite...at sunset when the dark shall cover him.”\nPaul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss...blind time. There was no past occupying the future in his mind... except...except...he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving...somewhere ahead... still see the jihad’s bloody swords and fanatic legions.\nIt will not be, he told himself. / cannot let it be.\nGod created Arrakis to train the faithful.\n—FROM “THE WISDOM OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n| n the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of his watchmen.\nThe great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave’s opening. She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in the dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had— the ability to sense even the slightest change in the air’S moisture.\nHow they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened! Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:\n“Ima trava okolo! | korenja okolo!”\nJessica translated silently: These are ashes! And these are roots!\nThe funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.\nShe looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky. Night was beginning\nto utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the dunes.\nYet the heat persisted.\nHeat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times.\nThirst.\nShe could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks...and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath’s moisture.\nThe suit itself was a sweatbox.\n“Your suit will be more comfortable when you've adjusted to a lower water content in your body,” Stilgar had said.\nShe knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind. No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.\nAnd that was a more subtle and profound matter.\nShe heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave’s depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.\nThere’s another thing, Jessica thought. Pau/ must be cautioned about their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine, yes, but not as wife.\nThen she wondered at herself, thinking: Have / been infected with his schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. / can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet...| was more than concubine.\n“Mother.”\nPaul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.\n“Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?”\nJessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. “I think so.”\n“Chani showed me...because I’m Supposed to see it and give my...permission for the weighing of the water.”\nJessica looked at Chani\n######################\nOutput:",

Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\n“A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,” Hawat had said.\nArrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.\nPaul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip- drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions.\nThe dream faded.\nPaul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed —thinking...thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o’-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate.\nArrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.\nPaul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness...focusing the consciousness...aortal dilation...avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness...to be conscious by choice...blood enriched and swift- flooding the overload regions...one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone...animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct...the animal destroys and does not produce...animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual...the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe...focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid...bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs...all things/cells/beings are impermanent... Strive for flow-permanence within....\nOver and over and over within Paul’s floating awareness the lesson rolled.\nWhen dawn touched Paul’s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.\nThe hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly.\n“You're awake,” she said. “Did you sleep well?”\n“Yes.”\nHe studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.\n“Hurry and dress,” she said. “Reverend Mother is waiting.”\n“| dreamed of her once,” Paul said. “Who is she?”\n“She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she’s the Emperor’s Truthsayer. And Paul....” She hesitated. “You must tell her about your dreams.”\n“I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?”\n“We did not get Arrakis.” Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. “Don’t keep Reverend Mother waiting.”\nPaul sat up, hugged his knees. “What’s a gom jabbar?”\nAgain, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.\nJessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. “You’ll learn about...the gom jabbar soon enough,” she said.\nHe heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.\nJessica spoke without turning. “Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.”\nx x xX\nhe Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a\ntapestried chair watching mother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this morning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor’s Truthsayer couldn’t evade that responsibility when the duty call came.\nDamn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought.\nIf only she’d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!\nJessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle flick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught—the one used “when in doubt of another’s station.”\nThe nuances of Paul’s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: “He’s a cautious one, Jessica.”\nJessica’s hand went to Paul’s shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. “Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.”\nWhat does she fear? Paul wondered.\nThe old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like Jessica’s, but strong bones... hair: the Duke’s black-black but with browline of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.\nNow, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura—even in death, the Reverend Mother thought.\n“Teaching is one thing,” she said, “the basic ingredient is another. We shall see.” The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. “Leave us. | enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace.”\nJessica took her hand from Paul’s shoulder. “Your Reverence, I—”\n“Jessica, you know it must be done.”\nPaul looked up at his mother, puzzled.\nJessica straightened. “Yes...of course.”\nPaul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother’s obvious awe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.\n“Paul....” Jessica took a deep breath. “...this test you're about to receive...it’s important to me.”\n“Test?” He looked up at her.\n“Remember that you’re a duke’s son,” Jessica said. She whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.\nPaul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. “Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?”\nA smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. “The Lady Jessica was my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school.” She nodded. “And a good one, too. Now, you come here!”\nThe command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it. Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees.\n“See this?” she asked. From the folds of her gown, She lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open—black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness.\n“Put your right hand in the box,” she said.\nFear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: “Is this how you obey your mother?”\nHe looked up into bird-bright eyes.\nSlowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his hand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.\nA predatory look filled the old woman’s features. She lifted her right hand away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul’s neck. He Saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward it.\n“Stop!” she snapped.\nUsing the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.\n“I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,” she said. “The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It’s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don’t pull away or you'll feel that poison.”\nPaul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from the seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke.\n“A duke’s son must know about poisons,” she said. “It’s the way of our times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here’s a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.”\nPride overcame Paul’s fear. “You dare suggest a duke’s son is an animal?” he demanded.\n“Let us say | Suggest you may be human,” she said. “Steady! | warn you not to try jerking away. | am\nold, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me.”\n“Who are you?” he whispered. “How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?”\n“The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.” A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.\n“Good,” she said. “You pass the first test. Now, here’s the way of the rest of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.”\nPaul took a deep breath to still his trembling. “If | call out there’ll be servants on you in seconds and you'll die.”\n“Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door. Depend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it’s your turn. Be honored. We seldom administer this to men-children.”\nCuriosity reduced Paul’s fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the old woman’s voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there...if this were truly a test.... And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it, trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite.\n“I must not fear. Fear is the mina-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. | will face my fear. | will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner\neye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\nHe felt calmness return, said: “Get on with it, old woman.”\n“Old woman!” she snapped. “You’ve courage,\n######################\nOutput:",
