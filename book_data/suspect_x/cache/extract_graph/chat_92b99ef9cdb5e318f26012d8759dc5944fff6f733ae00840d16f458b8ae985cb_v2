Short-lived humanity would turn upon them. No—it was unthinkable.\n“| don’t like the trend of your thoughts,” she said.\n“You don’t understand my thoughts,” he said. “Ghani and |...” He shook his head. “Alia had it in her grasp and threw it away.”\n“Are you sure of that? I’ve already sent word to the Sisterhood that Alia practices the unthinkable. Look at her! She’s not aged a day since last |...”\n“Oh, that!” He dismissed Bene Gesserit body balance with a wave of his hand. “I’m speaking of something else—a perfection of being far beyond anything humans have ever before achieved.”\nJessica remained silent, aghast at how easily he’d lifted her disclosure from her. He’d know surely that such a message represented a death sentence on Alia. And no matter how he changed the words, he could only be talking about committing the same offense. Didn’t he know the peril of his words?\n“You must explain,” she said finally.\n“How?” he asked. “Unless you understand that Time isn’t what it appears, | can’t even begin to explain. My father\nsuspected it. He stood at the edge of realization, but fell back. Now it’s up to Ghani and me.”\n“I insist that you explain,” Jessica said and she fingered the poisoned needle she held beneath a fold of her robe. It was the gom jabbar, so deadly that the slightest prick of it killed within seconds. And she thought: They warned me I might have to use it. The thought sent the muscles of her arm trembling in waves and she was thankful for the concealing robe.\n“Very well,” he sighed. “First, as to Time: there is no difference between ten thousand years and one year; no difference between one hundred thousand years and a heartbeat. No difference. That is the first fact about Time. And the second fact: the entire universe with all of its Time is within me.”\n“What nonsense is this?” she demanded.\n“You see? You don’t understand. | will try to explain in another way, then.” He raised his right hand to illustrate, moving it as he spoke. “We go forward, we come back.”\n“Those words explain nothing!”\n“That is correct,” he said. “There are things which words cannot explain. You must experience them without words. But you are not prepared for such a venture, just as when you look at me you do not see me.”\n“But... I’m looking directly at you. Of course | see you!” She glared at him. His words reflected knowledge of the Zensunni Codex as she’d been taught it in the Bene Gesserit schools: play of words to confuse one’s understanding of philosophy.\n“Some things occur beyond your control,” he said.\n“How does that explain this... this perfection which is so far beyond other human experiences?”\nHe nodded. “If one delays old age or death by the use of melange or by that learned adjustment of fleshly balance which you Bene Gesserits so rightly fear, such a delay invokes only an illusion of control. Whether one walks\nrapidly through the sietch or slowly, one traverses the sietch. And that passage of time is experienced internally.”\n“Why do you bandy words this way? | cut my wisdom teeth on such nonsense long before even your father was born.”\n“But only the teeth grew,” he said.\n“Words! Words!”\n“Ahhh, you’re very close!”\n“Hah!”\n“Grandmother?”\n“Yes?”\nHe held his silence for a long space. Then: “You see? You can still respond as yourself.” He smiled at her. “But you cannot see past the shadows. | am here.” Again he smiled. “My father came very near to this. When he lived, he lived, but when he died, he failed to die.”\n“What’re you saying?”\n“Show me his body!”\n“Do you think this Preacher...”\n“Possible, but even so, that is not his body.”\n“You’ve explained nothing,” she accused.\n“Just as | warned you.”\n“Then why...”\n“You asked. You had to be shown. Now let us return to Alia and her plan of abduction for—”\n“Are you planning the unthinkable?” she demanded, holding the poisonous gom jabbar at the ready beneath her robe.\n“Will you be her executioner?” he asked, his voice deceptively mild. He pointed a finger at the hand beneath her robe. “Do you think she’ll permit you to use that? Or do you think I’d let you use it?”\nJessica found she could not swallow.\n“In answer to your question,” he said, “I do not plan the unthinkable. | am not that stupid. But | am shocked at you. You dare judge Alia. Of course she’s broken the precious\nBene Gesserit commandment! What’d you expect? You ran out on her, left her as queen here in all but name. All of that power! So you ran back to Caladan to nurse your wounds in Gurney’s arms. Good enough. But who are you to judge Alia?”\n“Į tell you, | will not dis—”\n“Oh, shut up!” He looked away from her in disgust. But his words had been uttered in that special Bene Gesserit way—the controlling Voice. It silenced her as though a hand had been clapped over her mouth. She thought: Who’d know how to hit me with Voice better than this one? It was a mitigating argument which eased her wounded feelings. As many times as she’d used Voice on others, she’d never expected to be susceptible to it... not ever again... not since the school days when...\nHe turned back to her. “I’m sorry. | just happen to know how blindly you can be expected to react when—”\n“Blindly? Me?” She was more outraged by this than she’d been by his exquisite use of Voice against her.\n“You,” he said. “Blindly. If you’ve any honesty left in you at all, you'll recognize your own reactions. | call your name and you say, ‘Yes?’ | silence your tongue. | invoke all your Bene Gesserit myths. Look inward the way you were taught. That, at least, is something you can do for your—”\n“How dare you! What do you know of...” Her voice trailed off. Of course he knew!\n“Look inward, | say!” His voice was imperious.\nAgain, his voice enthralled her. She found her senses stilled, felt a quickening of breath. Just beyond awareness lurked a pounding heart, the panting of .. . Abruptly she realized that the quickened breath, the pounding heart, were not latent, not held at bay by her Bene Gesserit control. Eyes widening in shocked awareness, she felt her own flesh obeying other commands. Slowly she recovered her poise, but the realization remained. This unchild had\nbeen playing her like a fine instrument throughout their interview.\n“Now you know how profoundly you were conditioned by your precious Bene Gesserits,” he said.\nShe could only nod. Her belief in words lay shattered. Leto had forced her to look her physical universe squarely in the face, and she’d come away shaken, her mind running with a new awareness. “Show me his body!” He’d shown her her own body as though it were newborn. Not since her earliest schooling days on Wallach, not since those terrifying days before the Duke’s buyers came for her, not since then had She felt such trembling uncertainty about her next moments.\n“You will allow yourself to be abducted,” Leto said.\n“But—”\n“I’m not asking for discussion on this point,” he said. “You will allow it. Think of this as a command from your Duke. You'll see the purpose when it’s done. You’re going to confront a very interesting student.”\nLeto stood, nodded. He said: “Some actions have an end but no beginning; some begin but do not end. It all depends upon where the observer is standing.” Turning, he left her chambers.\nIn the second anteroom, Leto met Ghanima hurrying into their private quarters. She stopped as she saw him, said: “Alia’s busy with the Convocation of the Faith.” She looked a question at the passage which led to Jessica’s quarters.\n“It worked,” Leto said.\nAtrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past. Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-perpetuating upon itself—a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred.\n—THE APOCRYPHA OF MUAD’DIB\nhortly after noon, when most of the pilgrims had\nwandered off to refresh themselves in whatever cooling shade and source of libation they could find, The Preacher entered the great square below Alia’s Temple. He came on the arm of his surrogate eyes, young Assan Tariq. Ina pocket beneath his flowing robe, The Preacher carried the black gauze mask he’d worn on Salusa Secundus. It amused him to think that the mask and the boy served the same purpose—disguise. While he needed surrogate eyes, doubts remained alive.\nLet the myth grow, but keep doubts alive, he thought.\nNo one must discover that the mask was merely cloth, not an Ixian artifact at all. His hand must not slip from Assan Tarig’s bony shoulder. Let The Preacher once walk as the sighted despite his eyeless sockets, and all doubts would dissolve. The small hope he nursed would be dead. Each day he prayed for a change, something different over which he might stumble, but even Salusa Secundus had been a pebble, every aspect known. Nothing changed; nothing could be changed ... yet.\nMany people marked his passage past the shops and arcades, noting the way he turned his head from side to side, holding it centered on a doorway or a person. The\nmovements of his head were not always blind-natural, and this added to the growing myth.\nAlia watched from a concealed slit in the towering battlement of her temple. She searched that scarred visage far below for some sign—a sure sign of identity. Every rumor was reported to her. Each new one came with its thrill of fear.\nShe’d thought her order to take The Preacher captive would remain secret, but that, too, came back to her now as a rumor. Even among her guards, someone could not remain silent. She hoped now that the guards would follow her new orders and not take this robed mystery captive in a public place where it could be seen and reported.\nIt was dusty hot in the square. The Preacher’s young guide had pulled the veil of his robe up around his nose, leaving only the dark eyes and a thin patch of forehead exposed. The veil bulged with the outline of a stillsuit’s catchtube. This told Alia that they’d come in from the desert. Where did they hide out there?\nThe Preacher wore no veil protection from the searing air. He had even dropped the catchtube flap of his stillsuit. His face lay open to the sunlight and the heat shiverings which lifted off the square’s paving blocks in visible waves.\nAt the Temple steps there stood a group of nine pilgrims making their departure obeisance. The shadowed edge of the square held perhaps fifty more persons, mostly pilgrims devoting themselves to various penances imposed by the priesthood. Among the onlookers could be seen messengers and a few merchants who’d not yet made enough sales to close up for the worst of the day’s heat.\nx x x\nVA a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_92b99ef9cdb5e318f26012d8759dc5944fff6f733ae00840d16f458b8ae985cb_v2"}
