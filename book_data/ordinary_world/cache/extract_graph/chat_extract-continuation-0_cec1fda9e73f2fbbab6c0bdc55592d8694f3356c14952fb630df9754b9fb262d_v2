\n　　我们不会忘记，那年在这同一地方，金俊文夫妇在戏场上出售大儿子从外地偷回来的各色时髦成衣，是何等的喜气洋洋。而高瞻远瞩的金俊武当时就预言他们“好吃难消化，吃了屙不下”！ \n　　现在，这两辈三个人脸色灰白立在戏台子前，一人一副手铐，六条腿索索地抖着。法院的人在历数他们的罪行。台下，无数双眼睛在盯着他们——其中包括双水村的男女老少和他们自家的人。 \n　　人群里最畅快的要数石圪节“胡记理发馆”的王彩娥了。金俊文的前弟媳妇描眉擦粉，穿着入时，此刻站在人群里一边嗑葵花籽，一边向周围的陌生乡民臭骂数落这家人的坏德行；甚至把金俊武和李玉玲也骂在了一块。 \n　　法院最后的宣判结果：判处盗窃团伙首犯金富有期徒刑十八年；窝赃犯金俊文有期徒刑四年；张桂兰有期徒刑二年，缓期二年执行。 \n　　当天，金俊文父子又被警车拉回了原西，而缓刑的张桂兰似乎从阴曹界走了一回，浑身半瘫着被二小子金强架着胳膊引回了双水村。 \n　　谁能想到，当张桂兰母子脸上无光回到自家院落后不久，石圪节乡副乡长杨高虎带了一帮子人，敲锣打鼓进了隔壁金光亮家的院子。高虎他们是给金光亮送他儿子金二锤在南方前线的立功喜报来了。 \n　　观看金俊文家道败落的村民们，即刻又转而观看了金光亮家的荣耀场面。光亮喜得嘴咧了多大，满院子嚷嚷着给众人散发带锡纸烟；并破例用蜂蜜水款待了乡上送喜报的官员。双水村啊！悲剧和喜剧在轮番上演……这时候，金家湾这面的头号能人金俊武却陷入了严重的危机之中。 \n　　从表面上说来，大哥一家秋风落叶般的衰败与他金俊武并没有什么。犯法的是他哥一家而不是他们！几年来，正是因为深恶痛绝大哥家靠鼠窃狗偷发不义之财，才使他和俊文别了兄弟之情。 \n　　可是现在，当这个家庭一夜之间完蛋之后，他内心却感到异常痛苦。是的，他们自食恶果，罪有应得；他们的下场他预料到了。但是，他们和俊文终究是一家人啊！大祸不能不殃及他们。其它先撇过不说，识文断理的父亲生前在东拉河一道川为金家带来的好名声，被大哥一家完全葬送了。好名声是金子都买不回来的。树活皮，人活脸，他金家的子孙后代都成了众人唾骂的对象！
