The ruined man had recognized him quickly.\n“Where do the Honored Matres hunt for me now?” Teg asked.\n“Everywhere, Bashar. We cannot guarantee your safety but steps are being taken. | will make it known where | have delivered you.”\n“Do they say why they hunt me?”\n“They never explain, Bashar.”\n“How long have they been on Gammu?”\n“Too long, sir. Since | was a child and | was a baltern at Renditai.”\nA hundred years at least, Teg thought. Time to gather many forces into their hands... if Taraza’s fears were to be credited.\nTeg credited them.\n“Trust no one those whores can influence,” Taraza had said.\nTeg sensed no threat to him in his present position, though. He could only absorb the secrecy that obviously enclosed him now. He did not press for more details.\nThey were well into Ysai and he glimpsed the black bulk of the ancient Harkonnen seat of Barony through occasional\ngaps between the walls that enclosed the great private residences. The car turned onto a street of small commercial establishments: cheap buildings constructed for the most part of salvaged materials that displayed their origins in poor fits and unmatched colors. Gaudy signs advised that the wares inside were the finest, the repair services better than those elsewhere.\nIt was not that Ysai had deteriorated or even gone to seed, Teg thought. Growth here had been diverted into something worse than ugly. Someone had chosen to make this place repellent. That was the key to most of what he Saw in the city.\nTime had not stopped here, it had retreated. This was no modern city full of bright transport pods and insulated usiform buildings. This was random jumbles, ancient structures joined to ancient structures, some built to individual tastes and some obviously designed with some long-gone necessity in mind. Everything about Ysai was joined in a proximity whose disarray just managed to avoid chaos. What saved it, Teg knew, was the old pattern of thoroughfares along which this hodgepodge had been assembled. Chaos was held at bay, although what pattern there was in the streets conformed to no master plan. Streets met and crossed at odd angles, seldom squared. Seen from the air, the place was a crazy quilt with only the giant black rectangle of ancient Barony to speak of an organizing plan. The rest of it was architectural rebellion.\nTeg saw suddenly that this place was a lie plastered over with other lies, based on previous lies, and such a mad mixup that they might never dig through to a usable truth. All of Gammu was that way. Where could such insanity have had its beginnings? Was it the Harkonnens’ doing?\n“We are here, sir.”\nThe driver drew up to the curb in front of a windowless building face, all flat black plasteel and with a single ground- level door. No salvaged material in this construction. Teg\nrecognized the place: the bolt hole he had chosen. Unidentified things flickered in Teg’s second vision but he sensed no immediate menace. The driver opened Teg’s door and stood to one side.\n“Not much activity here at this hour, sir. | would get inside quickly.”\nWithout a backward glance, Teg darted across the narrow walk and into the building—a small brightly lighted foyer of polished white plaz and only banks of comeyes to greet him. He ducked into a lift tube and punched the remembered coordinates. This tube, he knew, angled upward through the building to the fifty-seventh floor rear where there were some windows. He remembered a private dining room of dark reds and heavy brown furnishings, a hard-eyed female with the obvious signs of Bene Gesserit training, but no Reverend Mother.\nThe tube disgorged him into the remembered room but there was no one to receive him. Teg glanced around at the solid brown furnishings. Four windows along the far wall were concealed behind thick maroon draperies.\nTeg knew he had been seen. He waited patiently, using his newly learned doubling-vision to anticipate trouble. There was no indication of attack. He took up a position to one side of the tube outlet and glanced around him once more.\nTeg had a theory about the relationship between rooms and their windows—the number of windows, their placement, their size, height from the floor, relationship of room size to window size, the elevation of the room, windows curtained or draped, and all of this Mentat- interpreted against knowledge of the uses to which a room was put. Rooms could be fitted to a kind of pecking order defined with extreme sophistication. Emergency uses might throw such distinctions out the window but they otherwise were quite reliable.\nLack of windows in an aboveground room conveyed a particular message. If humans occupied such a room, it did not necessarily mean secrecy was the main goal. He had seen unmistakable signs in scholastic settings that windowless schoolrooms were both a retreat from the exterior world and a strong statement of dislike for children.\nThis room, however, presented something different: conditional secrecy plus the need to keep occasional watch on that exterior world. Protective secrecy when required. His opinion was reinforced when he crossed the room and twitched one of the draperies aside. The windows were tripled armor-plaz. So! Keeping watch on that world outside might draw attack. That was the opinion of whoever had ordered the room protected this way.\nOnce more, Teg twitched the drapery aside. He glanced at the corner glazing. Prismatic reflectors there amplified the view along the adjacent wall to both sides and from roof to ground.\nWell!\nHis previous visit had not given him time for this closer examination but now he made a more positive assessment. A very interesting room. Teg dropped the drapery and turned just in time to see a tall man enter from the tube Slot.\nTeg’s doubled vision provided a firm prediction on the stranger. This man brought concealed danger. The newcomer was plainly military—the way he carried himself, the quick eye for details that only a trained and experienced officer would observe. And there was something else in his manner that made Teg stiffen. This was a betrayer! A mercenary available to the highest bidder.\n“Damned nasty the way they treated you,” the man greeted Teg. The voice was a deep baritone with an unconscious assumption of personal power in it. The accent was one Teg had never before heard. This was someone from the Scattering! A Bashar or equivalent, Teg estimated.\nStill, there was no indication of immediate attack.\nWhen Teg did not answer, the man said: “Oh, sorry: I’m Muzzafar. Jafa Muzzafar, regional commander for the forces of Dur.”\nTeg had never heard of the forces of Dur.\nQuestions crowded Teg’s mind but he kept them to himself. Anything he said here might betray weakness.\nWhere were the people who had met him here before? Why did I choose this place? The decision had been made with such inner assurance.\n“Please be comfortable,” Muzzafar said, indicating a small divan with a low serving table in front of it. “I assure you that none of what has happened to you was of my doing. Tried to put a stop to it when | heard but you'd already... left the scene.”\nTeg heard the other thing in this Muzzafar’s voice now: caution bordering on fear. So this man had either heard about or seen the shack and the clearing.\n“Damned clever of you,” Muzzafar said. “Having your attack force wait until your captors were concentrating on trying to get information out of you. Did they learn anything?”\nTeg shook his head silently from side to side. He felt on the edge of being ignited in a blurred response to attack, yet he sensed no immediate violence here. What were these Lost Ones doing? But Muzzafar and his people had made a wrong assessment of what had happened in the room of the T-probe. That was clear.\n“Please, be seated,” Muzzafar said.\nTeg took the proffered seat on the divan.\nMuzzafar sat in a deep chair facing Teg at a slight angle on the other side of the serving table. There was a crouching sense of alertness in Muzzafar. He was prepared for violence.\nTeg studied the man with interest. Muzzafar had revealed no real rank—only commander. Tall fellow with a wide, ruddy\nface and a big nose. The eyes were gray-green and had the trick of focusing just behind Teg’s right shoulder when either of them spoke. Teg had known a spy once who did that.\n“Well, well,” Muzzafar said. “I’ve read and heard a great deal about you since coming here.”\nTeg continued to study him silently. Muzzafar’s hair had been cropped close and there was a purple scar about three millimeters long across the scalp line above the left eye. He wore an open bush jacket of light green and matching trousers—not quite a uniform but there was a neatness about him that spoke of customary spit and polish. The shoes attested to this. Teg thought he probably could see his own reflection in their light brown surfaces if he bent close.\n“Never expected to meet you personally, of course,” Muzzafar said. “Consider it a great honor.”\n“I know very little about you except that you command a force from the Scattering,” Teg said.\n“Mmmmmph! Not much to know, really.”\nOnce more, hunger pangs gripped Teg. His gaze went to the button beside the tube slot, which, he remembered, would summon a waiter. This was a place where humans did the work usually assigned to automata, an excuse for keeping a large force assembled at the ready.\nMisinterpreting Teg’s interest in the tube slot, Muzzafar said: “Please don’t think of leaving. Having my own medic come in to take a look at you. Shouldn’t be but a moment. Appreciate it if you’d wait quietly until he arrives.”\n“I was merely thinking of placing an order for some food,” Teg said.\n“Advise you to wait until the doctor’s had his look-see. Stunners leave some nasty aftereffects.”\n“So you know about that.”\n“Know about the whole damned fiasco. You and your man Burzmali are a force to be reckoned with.”\nBefore Teg could respond, the tube slot disgorged a tall man in a jacketed red singlesuit, a man so bone-skinny that his clothing gaped and flapped about him. The diamond tattoo of a Suk doctor had been burned into his high forehead but the mark was orange and not the customary black. The doctor’s eyes were concealed by a glistening orange cover that hid their true color.\nAn addict of some kind? Teg wondered. There was no smell of the familiar narcotics around him, not even melange. There was a tart smell, though, almost like some fruit.\n“There you are, Solitz!” Muzzafar said. He gestured at Teg. “Give him a good scan. Stunner hit him day before yesterday.”\nSolitz produced a recognizable Suk scanner, compact and fitting into one hand. Its probe field produced a low hum.\n“So you’re a Suk doctor,” Teg said, looking pointedly at the orange brand on the forehead.\n“Yes, Bashar. My training and conditioning are the finest in our ancient tradition.”\n“I’ve never seen the identifying mark in that color,” Teg said.\nThe doctor passed his scanner around Teg’s head. “The color of the tattoo makes no difference, Bashar. What is behind it is all that matters.” He lowered the scanner to Teg’s shoulders, then down across the body.\nTeg waited for the humming", " kind? Teg wondered. There was no smell of the familiar narcotics around him, not even melange. There was a tart smell, though, almost like some fruit.\n“There you are, Solitz!” Muzzafar said. He gestured at Teg. “Give him a good scan. Stunner hit him day before yesterday.”\nSolitz produced a recognizable Suk scanner, compact and fitting into one hand.

What is behind it is all that matters.” He lowered the scanner to Teg’s shoulders, then down across the body.\nTeg waited for the humming to stop.\nThe doctor stood back and addressed Muzzafar: “He is quite fit, Field Marshal. Remarkably fit, considering his age, but he desperately needs sustenance.”\n“Yes... well, that’s fine then, Solitz. Take care of that. The Bashar is our guest.”\n“I will order a meal suited to his needs,” Solitz said. “Eat it slowly, Bashar.” Solitz did a smart about-face that set his jacket and trousers flapping. The tube slot swallowed him.\n“Field Marshal?” Teg asked.\n“A revival of ancient titles in the Dur,” Muzzafar said.\n“The Dur?” Teg ventured.\n“Stupid of me!” Muzzafar produced a small case from a side pocket of his jacket and extracted a thin folder. Teg recognized a holostat similar to one he had carried himself during his long service—pictures of home and family. Muzzafar placed the holostat on the table between them and tapped the control button.\nThe full-color image of a bushy green expanse of jungle came alive in miniature above the tabletop.\n“Home,” Muzzafar said. “Frame bush in the center there.” A finger indicated a place in the projection. “First one that ever obeyed me. People laughed at me for choosing the first one that way and sticking with it.”\nTeg stared at the projection, aware of a deep sadness in Muzzafar’s voice. The indicated bush was a spindly grouping of thin limbs with bright blue bulbs dangling from the tips.\nFrame bush?\n“Rather thin thing, | Know,” Muzzafar said, removing his pointing finger from the projection. “Not secure at all. Had to defend myself a few times in the first months with it. Grew rather fond of it, though. They respond to that, you know. It’s the best home in all the deep valleys now, by the Eternal Rock of Dur!”\nMuzzafar stared at Teg’s puzzled expression. “Damn! You don’t have frame bushes, of course. You must forgive my crashing ignorance. We've a great deal to teach each other, | think.”\n“You called that home,” Teg said.\n“Oh, yes. With proper direction, once they learn to obey, of course, a frame bush will grow itself into a magnificent residence. It only takes four or five standards.”\nStandards, Teg thought. So the Lost Ones still used the Standard Year.\nThe tube slot hissed and a young woman in a blue serving gown backed into the room towing a suspensor-buoyed\nhotpod, which she positioned near the table in front of Teg. Her clothing was of the type Teg had seen during his original inspection but the pleasantly round face she turned to him was unfamiliar. Her scalp had been depilated, leaving an expanse of prominent veins. Her eyes were watery blue and there was something cowed in her posture. She opened the hotpod and the spicy odors of the food wafted across Teg’s nostrils.\nTeg was alerted but he sensed no immediate threat. He could see himself eating the food without ill effect.\nThe young woman put a row of dishes on to the table in front of him and arranged the eating implements neatly at one side.\n“I’ve no snooper, but l'Il taste the foods if you wish,” Muzzafar said.\n“Not necessary,” Teg said. He knew this would raise questions but felt they would suspect him of being a Truthsayer. Teg’s gaze locked onto the food. Without any conscious decision, he leaned forward and began eating. Familiar with Mentat-hunger, he was surprised at his own reactions. Using the brain in Mentat mode consumed calories at an alarming rate, but this was a new necessity driving him. He felt his own survival controlling his actions. This hunger went beyond anything of previous experience. The soup he had eaten with some caution at the house of the ruined man had not aroused such a demanding reaction.\nThe Suk doctor chose correctly, Teg thought. This food had been selected directly out of the scanner’s summation.\nThe young woman kept bringing more dishes from hotpods ordered via the tube slot.\nTeg had to get up in the middle of the meal and relieve himself in an adjoining washroom, conscious there of the hidden comeyes that were keeping him under surveillance. He knew by his physical reactions that his digestive system had speeded up to a new level of bodily necessity. When he\nreturned to the table, he felt just as hungry as though he had not eaten.\nThe serving woman began to show signs of surprise and then alarm. Still, she kept bringing more food at his demand.\nMuzzafar watched with growing amazement but said nothing.\nTeg felt the supportive replacement of the food, the precise caloric adjustment that the Suk doctor had ordered. They obviously had not thought about quantity, though. The girl obeyed his demands in a kind of walking shock.\nMuzzafar spoke finally. “Must say I’ve never before seen anyone eat that much at one sitting. Can’t see how you do it. Nor why.”\nTeg sat back, satisfied at last, knowing he had aroused questions that could not be answered truthfully.\n“A Mentat thing,” Teg lied. “I’ve been through a very strenuous time.”\n“Amazing,” Muzzafar said. He arose.\nWhen Teg started to stand, Muzzafar gestured for him to remain. “No need. We’ve prepared quarters for you right next door. Safer not to move you yet.”\nThe young woman departed with the empty hotpods.\nTeg studied Muzzafar. Something had changed during the meal. Muzzafar watched him with a coldly measuring stare.\n“You’ve an implanted communicator,” Teg said. “You have received new orders.”\n“It would not be advisable for your friends to attack this place,” Muzzafar said.\n“You think that’s my plan?”\n“What is your plan, Bashar?”\nTeg smiled.\n“Very well.” Muzzafar’s gaze went out of focus as he listened to his communicator. When he once more concentrated on Teg, his gaze had the look of a predator. Teg felt himself buffeted by that gaze, recognizing that\nsomeone else was coming to this room. The Field Marshal thought of this new development as something extremely dangerous to his dinner guest but Teg saw nothing that could defeat his new abilities.\n“You think | am your prisoner,” Teg said.\n“By the Eternal Rock, Bashar! You are not what | expected!”\n“The Honored Matre who is coming, what does she expect?” Teg asked.\n“Bashar, | warn you: Do not take that tone with her. You have not the slightest concept of what is about to happen to you.”\n“An Honored Matre is about to happen to me,” Teg said.\n“And | wish you well of her!”\nMuzzafar pivoted and left via the tube slot.\nTeg stared after him. He could see the flickering of second vision like a light blinking around the tube slot. The Honored Matre was near but not yet ready to enter this room. First, she would consult with Muzzafar. The Field Marshal would not be able to tell this dangerous female anything really important.\nMemory never recaptures reality. Memory reconstructs. All reconstructions change the original, becoming external frames of reference that inevitably fall short.\n—MENTAT HANDBOOK\nae and Burzmali entered Ysai from the south into a lower-class quarter with widely spaced streetlights. It lacked only an hour of midnight and yet people thronged the streets in this quarter. Some walked quietly, some chatted with drug-enhanced vigor, some only watched expectantly. They wadded up at the corners and held Lucilla’s fascinated attention as she passed.\nBurzmali urged her to walk faster, an eager customer anxious to get her alone. Lucilla kept her covert attention on the people.\nWhat did they do here? Those men waiting in the doorway: For what did they wait? Workers in heavy aprons emerged from a wide passage as Lucilla and Burzmali passed. There was a thick smell of rank sewage and perspiration about them. The workers, almost equally divided between male and female, were tall, heavy-bodied and with thick arms. Lucilla could not imagine what their occupation might be but they were of a single type and they made her realize how little she knew of Gammu.\nThe workers hawked and spat into the gutter as they emerged into the night. Ridding themselves of some contaminant?\nBurzmali put his mouth close to Lucilla’s ear and whispered: “Those workers are the Bordanos.”\nShe risked a glance back at them where they walked toward a side street. Bordanos? Ahhh, yes: people trained\nand bred to work the compression machinery that harnessed sewer gases. They had been bred to remove the sense of smell and the musculature of shoulders and arms had been increased. Burzmali guided her around a corner and out of sight of the Bordanos.\nFive children emerged from a dark doorway beside them and wheeled into line following Lucilla and Burzmali. Lucilla noted their hands clutching small objects. They followed with a strange intensity. Abruptly, Burzmali stopped and turned. The children also stopped and stared at him. It was clear to Lucilla that the children were prepared for some violence.\nBurzmali clasped both hands in front of him and bowed to the children. He said: “Guldur!”\nWhen Burzmali resumed guiding her down the street, the children no longer followed.\n“They would have stoned us,” he said.\n“Why?”\n“They are children of a sect that follows Guldur—the local name for the Tyrant.”\nLucilla looked back but the children were no longer in sight. They had set off in search of another victim.\nBurzmali guided her around another corner. Now, they were in a street crowded with small merchants selling their wares from wheeled stands—food, clothing, small tools, and knives. A singsong of shouts filled the air as the merchants tried to attract buyers. Their voices had that end of the workday lift—a false brilliance composed of the hope that old dreams would be fulfilled, yet colored by the knowledge that life would not change for them. It occurred to Lucilla that the people of these streets pursued a fleeting dream, that the fulfillment they sought was not the thing itself but a myth they had been conditioned to seek the way racing animals were trained to chase after the whirling bait on the endless oval of the racetrack.\nIn the street directly ahead of them a burly figure ina thickly padded coat was engaged in loud-voiced argument with a merchant who offered a string bag filled with the dark red bulbs of a sweetly acid fruit. The fruit smell was thick all around them. The merchant complained: “You would steal the food from the mouths of my children!”\nThe bulky figure", "eled stands—food, clothing, small tools, and knives.

The fruit smell was thick all around them. The merchant complained: “You would steal the food from the mouths of my children!”\nThe bulky figure spoke in a piping voice, the accent chillingly familiar to Lucilla: “I, too, have children!”\nLucilla controlled herself with an effort.\nWhen they were clear of the market street, she whispered to Burzmali: “That man in the heavy coat back there—a Tleilaxu Master!”\n“Couldn’t be,” Burzmali protested. “Too tall.”\n“Two of them, one on the shoulders of the other.”\n“You're sure?”\n“I’m sure.”\n“I’ve seen others like that since we arrived, but | didn’t suspect.”\n“Many searchers are in these streets,” she said.\nLucilla found that she did not much care for the everyday life of the gutter inhabitants on this gutter planet. She no longer trusted the explanation for bringing the ghola here. Of all those planets on which the precious ghola could have been raised, why had the Sisterhood chosen this one? Or was the ghola truly precious? Could it be that he was merely bait?\nAlmost blocking the narrow mouth of an alley beside them was a man plying a tall device of whirling lights.\n“Live!” he shouted. “Live!”\nLucilla slowed her pace to watch a passerby step into the alleyway and pass a coin to the proprietor, then lean into a concave basin made brilliant by the lights. The proprietor stared back at Lucilla. She saw a man with a narrow dark face, the face of a Caladanian primitive on a body only Slightly taller than that of a Tleilaxu Master. There had been\na look of contempt on his brooding face as he took the customer’s money.\nThe customer lifted his face from the basin with a shudder and then left the alley, staggering slightly, his eyes glazed.\nLucilla recognized the device. Users called it a hypnobong and it was outlawed on all of the more civilized worlds.\nBurzmali hurried her out of the view of the brooding hypnobong proprietor.\nThey came to a wider side street with a corner doorway set into the building across from them. Foot traffic all around; not a vehicle in sight. A tall man sat on the first step in the corner doorway, his knees drawn up close to his chin. His long arms were wrapped around his knees, the thin- fingered hands clasped tightly together. He wore a wide- brimmed black hat that shaded his face from the streetlights, but twin gleams from the shadows under that brim told Lucilla that this was no kind of human she had ever before encountered. This was something about which the Bene Gesserit had only speculated.\nBurzmali waited until they were well away from the seated figure before satisfying her curiosity.\n“Futar,” he whispered. “That’s what they call themselves. They’ve only recently been seen here on Gammu.”\n“A Tleilaxu experiment,” Lucilla guessed. And she thought: A mistake that has returned from the Scattering. “What are they doing here?” she asked.\n“Trading colony, so the natives here tell us.”\n“Don’t you believe it. Those are hunting animals that have been crossed with humans.”\n“Ahhh, here we are,” Burzmali said.\nHe guided Lucilla through a narrow doorway into a dimly lighted eating establishment. This was part of their disguise, Lucilla knew: Do what others in this quarter did, but she did not relish eating in this place, not with what she could interpret from the smells.\nThe place had been crowded but it was emptying as they entered.\n“This commerciel was recommended highly,” Burzmali said as they seated themselves in a mechaslot and waited for the menu to be projected.\nLucilla watched the departing customers. Night workers from nearby factories and offices, she guessed. They appeared anxious in their hurry, perhaps fearful of what might be done to them if they were tardy.\nHow insulated she had been at the Keep, she thought. She did not like what she was learning of Gammu. What a scruffy place this commerciel was! The stools at the counter to her right had been scarred and chipped. The tabletop in front of her had been scored and rubbed with gritty cleaners until it no longer could be kept clean by the vacusweep whose nozzle she could see near her left elbow. There was no sign of even the cheapest sonic to maintain cleanliness. Food and other evidence of deterioration had accumulated in the table’s scratches. Lucilla shuddered. She could not avoid the feeling that it had been a mistake to separate from the ghola.\nThe menu had been projected, she saw, and Burzmali already was scanning it.\n“I will order for you,” he said.\nBurzmali’s way of saying he did not want her to make a mistake by ordering something a woman of the Hormu might avoid.\nIt galled her to feel dependent. She was a Reverend Mother! She was trained to take command in any situation, mistress of her own destiny. How tiring all of this was. She gestured at the dirty window on her left where people could be seen passing on the narrow street.\n“Į am losing business while we dally, Skar.”\nThere! That was in character.\nBurzmali almost sighed. At last! he thought. She had begun to function once more as a Reverend Mother. He\ncould not understand her abstracted attitude, the way she looked at the city and its people.\nTwo milky drinks slid from the slot onto the table. Burzmali drank his in one swallow. Lucilla tested her drink on the tip of her tongue, sorting the contents. An imitation caffiate diluted with a nut-flavored juice.\nBurzmali gestured upward with his chin for her to drink it quickly. She obeyed, concealing a grimace at the chemical flavors. Burzmali’s attention was on something over her right shoulder but she dared not turn. That would be out of character.\n“Come.” He placed a coin on the table and hurried her out into the street. He smiled the smile of an eager customer but there was wariness in his eyes.\nThe tempo of the streets had changed. There were fewer people. The shadowy doors conveyed a deeper sense of menace. Lucilla reminded herself that she was supposed to represent a powerful guild whose members were immune to the common violence of the gutter. The few people on the street did make way for her, eyeing the dragons of her robe with every appearance of awe.\nBurzmali stopped at a doorway.\nIt was like the others along this street, set back slightly from the walkway, so tall that it appeared narrower than it actually was. An old-fashioned security beam guarded the entrance. None of the newer systems had penetrated to the slum, apparently. The streets themselves were testimony to that: designed for groundcars. She doubted that there was a roofpad in the entire area. No sign of flitters or ’thopters could be heard or seen. There was music, though—a faint Susurration reminiscent of semuta. Something new in semuta addiction? This would certainly be an area where addicts would go to ground.\nLucilla looked up at the face of the building as Burzmali moved ahead of her and made their presence known by breaking the doorway beam.\nThere were no windows in the building’s face. Only the faint glitterings of surface ’eyes here and there in the dull sheen of ancient plasteel. They were old-fashioned comeyes, she noted, much bigger than modern ones.\nA door deep in the shadows swung inward on silent hinges.\n“This way.” Burzmali reached back and urged her forward with a hand on her elbow.\nThey entered a dimly lighted hallway that smelled of exotic foods and bitter essences. She was a moment identifying some of the things that assailed her nostrils. Melange. She caught the unmistakable cinnamon ripeness. And yes, semuta. She identified burned rice, higet salts. Someone was masking another kind of cooking. There were explosives being made here. She thought of warning Burzmali but reconsidered. It was not necessary for him to know and there might be ears in this confined space to hear whatever she said.\nBurzmali led the way up a shadowy flight of stairs with a dim glowstrip along the slanting baseboard. At the top he found a hidden switch concealed behind a patch in the patched and repatched wall. There was no sound when he pushed the switch but Lucilla felt a change in the movement all around them. Silence. It was a new kind of silence in her experience, a crouching preparation for flight or violence.\nIt was cold in the stairwell and she shivered, but not from the chill. Footsteps sounded beyond the doorway beside the patch-masked switch.\nA gray-haired hag in a yellow smock opened the door and peered up at them past her straggling eyebrows.\n“It’s you,” she said, her voice wavering. She stood aside for them to enter.\nLucilla glanced swiftly around the room as she heard the door close behind them. It was a room the unobservant might think shabby, but that was superficial. Underneath, it was quality. The shabbiness was another mask, partly a\nmatter of this place having been fitted to a particularly demanding person: This goes here and nowhere else! That goes over there and it stays there! The furnishings and bric- a-brac looked a little worn but someone here did not object to that. The room felt better this way. It was that kind of room.\nWho possessed this room? The old woman? She was making her painful way toward a door on their left.\n“We are not to be disturbed until dawn,” Burzmali said.\nThe old woman stopped and turned.\nLucilla studied her. Was this another who shammed advanced age? No. The age was real. Every motion was diffused by unsteadiness—a trembling of the neck, a failure of the body that betrayed her in ways she could not prevent.\n“Even if it’s somebody important?” the old woman asked in her wavering voice.\nThe eyes twitched when she spoke. Her mouth moved only minimally to emit the necessary sounds, spacing out her words as though she drew them from somewhere deep within. Her shoulders, curved from years of bending at some fixed work, would not straighten enough for her to look Burzmali in the eyes. She peered upward past her brows instead, an oddly furtive posture.\n“What important person are you expecting?” Burzmali asked.\nThe old woman shuddered and appeared to take a long time understanding.\n“Impor-r-rtant people come here,” she said.\nLucilla recognized the body signals and blurted it because Burzmali must know:\n“She’s from Rakis!”\nThe old woman’s curious upward gaze locked on Lucilla. The ancient voice said: “I was a priestess, Hormu Lady.”\n“Of course she’s from Rakis,” Burzmali said. His tone warned her not to question.\n“I would not harm you,” the hag whined.\n“Do you"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_9b7cdca4b544d38dcea6eeb34a12c341fbf5ed7a3de6b2e42fbdd231be8f5b96_v2"}
