surprise. Alia and the Advocate stood frozen in their exposure.\nA disturbance toward the middle of the room caught Jessica’s attention and she forced a way through the throng, saw four supplicants holding the Priest official. His black cloth of intercession lay near his feet, a maula pistol exposed in its folds.\nAl-Fali thrust his way past Jessica, looked from the pistol to the Priest. The Fremen let out a cry of rage, came up from his belt with an achag blow, the fingers of his left hand rigid. They caught the Priest in the throat and he collapsed, strangling. Without a backward glance at the man he had killed, the old Naib turned an angry face toward the dais.\n“Dalal-il ’an-nubuwwa!” al-Fali called, placing both palms against his forehead, then lowering them. “The Qadis as- Salaf will not let me be silenced! If | do not slay those who interfere, others will slay them!”\nHe thinks he was the target, Jessica realized. She looked down at her sleeve, put a finger in the neat hole left by the\nmaula pellet. Poisoned, no doubt.\nThe supplicants had dropped the Priest. He lay writhing on the floor, dying with his larynx crushed. Jessica motioned to a pair of shocked courtiers standing at her left, said: “l want that man saved for questioning. If he dies, you die!” As they hesitated, peering toward the dais, she used Voice on them: “Move!”\nThe pair moved.\nJessica thrust herself to al-Fali’s side, nudged him: “You are a fool, Naib! They were after me, not you.”\nSeveral people around them heard her. In the immediate shocked silence, al-Fali glanced at the dais with its one toppled throne and Alia still seated on the other. The look of realization which came over his face could’ve been read by a novice.\n“Fedaykin,” Jessica said, reminding him of his old service to her family, “we who have been scorched know how to stand back to back.”\n“Trust me, My Lady,” he said, taking her meaning immediately.\nA gasp behind Jessica brought her whirling, and she felt al-Fali move to stand with his back to her. A woman in the gaudy garb of a city Fremen was straightening from beside the Priest on the floor. The two courtiers were nowhere to be seen. The woman did not even glance at Jessica, but lifted her voice in the ancient keening of her people—the call for those who serviced the deathstills, the call for them to come and gather a body’s water into the tribal cistern. It was a curiously incongruous noise coming from one dressed as this woman was. Jessica felt the persistence of the old ways even as she saw the falseness in this city woman. The creature in the gaudy dress obviously had killed the Priest to make sure he was silenced.\nWhy did she bother? Jessica wondered. She had only to wait for the man to die of asphyxiation. The act was a desperate one, a sign of deep fear.\nAlia sat forward on the edge of her throne, her eyes aglitter with watchfulness. A slender woman wearing the braid knots of Alia’s own guards strode past Jessica, bent over the Priest, straightened, and looked back at the dais. “He is dead.”\n“Have him removed,” Alia called. She motioned to guards below the dais. “Straighten the Lady Jessica’s chair.”\nSo you'll try to brazen it out! Jessica thought. Did Alia think anyone had been fooled? Al-Fali had spoken of the Qadis as-Salaf, calling on the holy fathers of Fremen mythology as his protectors. But no supernatural agency had brought a maula pistol into this room where no weapons were permitted. A conspiracy involving Javid’s people was the only answer, and Alia’s unconcern about her own person told everyone she was a part of that conspiracy.\nThe old Naib spoke over his shoulder to Jessica: “Accept my apologies, My Lady. We of the desert come to you as our last desperate hope, and now we see that you still have need of us.”\n“Matricide does not sit well on my daughter,” Jessica said.\n“The tribes will hear of this,” al-Fali promised.\n“If you have such desperate need of me,” Jessica asked, “why did you not approach me at the Convocation in Sietch Tabr?”\n“Stilgar would not permit it.”\nAhhh, Jessica thought, the rule of the Naibs! In Tabr, Stilgar’s word was law.\nThe toppled throne had been straightened. Alia motioned for her mother to return, said: “All of you please note the death of that traitor-Priest. Those who threaten me die.” She glanced at al-Fali. “My thanks to you, Naib.”\n“Thanks for a mistake,” al-Fali muttered. He looked at Jessica. “You were right. My rage removed one who Should’ve been questioned.”\nJessica whispered: “Mark those two courtiers and the woman in the colorful dress, Fedaykin. | want them taken\nand questioned.”\n“It will be done,” he said.\n“If we get out of here alive,” Jessica said. “Come, let us go back and play our parts.”\n“AS you say, My Lady.”\nTogether, they returned to the dais, Jessica mounting the steps and resuming her position beside Alia, al-Fali remaining in the supplicant’s position below.\n“Now,” Alia said.\n“One moment, daughter,” Jessica said. She held up her sleeve, exposed the hole with a finger through it. “The attack was aimed at me. The pellet almost found me even as | was dodging. You will all note that the maula pistol is no longer down there.” She pointed. “Who has it?”\nThere was no response.\n“Perhaps it could be traced,” Jessica said.\n“What nonsense!” Alia said. “/ was the—”\nJessica half turned toward her daughter, motioned with her left hand. “Someone down there has that pistol. Don’t you have a fear that—”\n“One of my guards has it!” Alia said.\n“Then that guard will bring the weapon to me,” Jessica said.\n“She’s already taken it away.”\n“How convenient,” Jessica said.\n“What are you saying?” Alia demanded.\nJessica allowed herself a grim smile. “I am saying that two of your people were charged with saving that traitor-Priest. | warned them that they would die if he died. They will die.”\n“I forbid it!”\nJessica merely shrugged.\n“We have a brave Fedaykin here,” Alia said, motioning toward al-Fali. “This argument can wait.”\n“It can wait forever,” Jessica said, speaking in Chakobsa, her words double-barbed to tell Alia that no argument would stop the death command.\n“We shall see!” Alia said. She turned to al-Fali. “Why are you here, Ghadhean al-Fali?”\n“To see the mother of Muad’Dib,” the Naib said. “What is left of the Fedaykin, that band of brothers who served her son, pooled their poor resources to buy my way in here past the avaricious guardians who shield the Atreides from the realities of Arrakis.”\nAlia said: “Anything the Fedaykin require, they have only\n“He came to see me,” Jessica interrupted. “What is your desperate need, Fedaykin?”\nAlia said: “I speak for the Atreides here! What is—”\n“Be silent, you murderous Abomination!” Jessica snapped. “You tried to have me killed, daughter | say it for all here to know. You can’t have everyone in this hall killed to silence them—as that Priest was silenced. Yes, the Naib’s blow would’ve killed the man, but he could’ve been saved. He could’ve been questioned! You have no concern that he was silenced. Spray your protests upon us as you will, your guilt is written in your actions!”\nAlia sat in frozen silence, face pale. And Jessica, watching the play of emotions across her daughter’s face, saw a terrifyingly familiar movement of Alia’s hands, an unconscious response which once had identified a deadly enemy of the Atreides. Alia’s fingers moved in a tapping rhythm—little finger twice, index finger three times, ring finger twice, little finger once, ring finger twice... and back through the tapping in the same order.\nThe old Baron!\nThe focus of Jessica’s eyes caught Alia’s attention and she glanced down at her hand, held it still, looked back at her mother to see the terrible recognition. A gloating smile locked Alia’s mouth.\n“So you have your revenge upon us,” Jessica whispered.\n“Have you gone mad, mother?” Alia asked.\n“I wish | had,” Jessica said. And she thought: She knows | will confirm this to the Sisterhood. She knows. She may even suspect I'll tell the Fremen and force her into a Trial of Possession. She cannot let me leave here alive.\n“Our brave Fedaykin waits while we argue,” Alia said.\nJessica forced her attention back to the old Naib. She brought her responses under control, said: “You came to see me, Ghadhean.”\n“Yes, My Lady. We of the desert see terrible things happening. The Little Makers come out of the sand as was foretold in the oldest prophecies. Shai-Hulud no longer can be found except in the deeps of the Empty Quarter. We have abandoned our friend, the desert!”\nJessica glanced at Alia, who merely motioned for Jessica to continue. Jessica looked out over the throng in the Chamber, saw the shocked alertness on every face. The import of the fight between mother and daughter had not been lost on this throng, and they must wonder why the audience continued. She returned her attention to al-Fali.\n“Ghadhean, what is this talk of Little Makers and the scarcity of sandworms?”\n“Mother of Moisture,” he said, using her old Fremen title, “we were warned of this in the Kitab al-lbar. We beseech thee. Let it not be forgotten that on the day Muad’Dib died, Arrakis turned by itself! We cannot abandon the desert.”\n“Hah!” Alia sneered. “The superstitious riffraff of the Inner Desert fear the ecological transformation. They—”\n“| hear you, Ghadhean,” Jessica said. “If the worms go, the spice goes. If the spice goes, what coin do we have to buy our way?”\nSounds of surprise: gasps and startled whispers could be heard spreading across the Great Hall. The Chamber echoed to the sound.\nAlia shrugged. “Superstitious nonsense!”\nAl-Fali lifted his right hand to point at Alia. “I speak to the Mother of Moisture, not to the Coan-Teen!”\nAlia’s hands gripped the arms of her throne, but she remained seated.\nAl-Fali looked at Jessica. “Once it was the land where nothing grew. Now there are plants. They spread like lice upon a wound. There have been clouds and rain along the belt of Dune! Rain, My Lady! Oh, precious mother of Muad’Dib, as sleep is death’s brother, so is rain on the Belt of Dune. It is the death of us all.”\n“We do only what Liet-Kynes and Muad’D", ". If the spice goes, what coin do we have to buy our way?”\nSounds of surprise: gasps and startled whispers could be heard spreading across the Great Hall. The Chamber echoed to the sound.\nAlia shrugged. “Superstitious nonsense!”\nAl-Fali lifted his right hand to point at Alia. “I speak to the Mother of Moisture, not to the Coan-Teen!”\nAlia’s hands gripped the arms of her throne, but she remained seated.\nAl-Fali looked at Jessica. “Once it was the land where nothing grew. Now there are plants. They spread like lice upon a wound. There have been clouds and rain along the belt of Dune! Rain, My Lady! Oh, precious mother of Muad’Dib, as sleep is death’s brother, so is rain on the Belt of Dune. It is the death of us all.”\n“We do only what Liet-Kynes and Muad’Dib himself designed for us to do,” Alia protested. “What is all of this superstitious gabble? We revere the words of Liet-Kynes, who told us: ‘I wish to see this entire planet caught up ina net of green plants.’ So it will be.”\n“And what of the worms and the spice?” Jessica asked.\n“There'll always be some desert,” Alia said. “The worms will survive.”\nShe’s lying, Jessica thought. Why does she lie?\n“Help us, Mother of Moisture,” al-Fali pleaded.\nWith an abrupt sensation of double vision, Jessica felt her awareness lurch, propelled by the old Naib’s words. It was the unmistakable adab, the demanding memory which came upon one of itself. It came without qualifications and held her senses immobile while the lesson of the past was impressed upon her awareness. She was caught up in it completely, a fish in the net. Yet she felt the demand of it as a human-most moment, each small part a reminder of creation. Every element of the lesson-memory was real but insubstantial in its constant change, and she knew this was the closest she might ever come to experiencing the prescient dietgrasp which had inflicted itself upon her son.\nAlia lied because she was possessed by one who would destroy the Atreides. She was, in herself, the first destruction. Then al-Fali spoke the truth: the sandworms are doomed unless the course of the ecological transformation is modified.\nIn the pressure of revelation, Jessica saw the people of the audience reduced to slow motion, their roles identified for her. She could pick the ones charged with seeing that she did not leave here alive! And the path through them lay there in her awareness as though outlined in bright light— confusion among them, one of them feinted to stumble into another, whole groups tangled. She saw, also, that she might leave this Great Hall only to fall into other hands. Alia did not care if she created a martyr. No—the thing which possessed her did not care.\nNow, in this frozen time, Jessica chose a way to save the old Naib and send him as messenger. The way through the audience remained indelibly clear. How simple it was! They were buffoons with barricaded eyes, their shoulders held in positions of immovable defense. Each position upon the great floor could be seen as an atrophic collision from which dead flesh might slough away to reveal skeletons. Their bodies, their clothes, and their faces described individual hells—the insucked breast of concealed terrors, the glittering hook of a jewel become substitute armor; the mouths were judgments full of frightened absolutes, cathedral prisms of eyebrows showing lofty and religious sentiments which their loins denied.\nJessica sensed dissolution in the shaping forces loosed upon Arrakis. Al-Fali’s voice had been like a distrans in her soul, awakening a beast from the deepest part of her.\nIn an eyeblink Jessica moved from the adab into the universe of movement, but it was a different universe from the one which had commanded her attention only a second before.\nAlia was starting to speak, but Jessica said: “Silence!” Then: “There are those who fear that | have returned without reservation to the Sisterhood. But since that day in the desert when the Fremen gave the gift of life to me and to my son, | have been Fremen!” And she lapsed into the old tongue which only those in this room who could profit by it\nwould understand: “Onsar akhaka zeliman aw maslumen!” Support your brother in his time of need, whether he be just or unjust!\nHer words had the desired effect, a subtle shifting of positions within the Chamber.\nBut Jessica raged on: “This Ghadhean al-Fali, an honest Fremen, comes here to tell me what others should have revealed to me. Let no one deny this! The ecological transformation has become a tempest out of control!”\nWordless confirmations could be seen throughout the room.\n“And my daughter delights in this!” Jessica said. “Mektub al-mellah! You carve wounds upon my flesh and write there in salt! Why did the Atreides find a home here? Because the Mohalata was natural to us. To the Atreides, government was always a protective partnership: Mohalata, as the Fremen have always known it. Now look at her!” Jessica pointed at Alia. “She laughs alone at night in contemplation of her own evil! Spice production will fall to nothing, or at best a fraction of its former level! And when word of that gets out—”\n“We'll have a corner on the most priceless product in the universe!” Alia shouted.\n“We'll have a corner on hell!” Jessica raged.\nAnd Alia lapsed into the most ancient Chakobsa, the Atreides private language with its difficult glottal stops and clicks: “Now, you know, mother! Did you think a granddaughter of Baron Harkonnen would not appreciate all of the lifetimes you crushed into my awareness before | was even born? When I raged against what you’d done to me, | had only to ask myself what the Baron would’ve done. And he answered! Understand me, Atreides bitch! He answered me!”\nJessica heard the venom and the confirmation of her guess. Abomination! Alia had been overwhelmed within, possessed by that cahueit of evil, the Baron Vladimir\nHarkonnen. The Baron himself spoke from her mouth now, uncaring of what was revealed. He wanted her to see his revenge, wanted her to know that he could not be cast out.\nl'm supposed to remain here helpless in my knowledge, Jessica thought. With the thought, she launched herself onto the path the adab had revealed, shouting: “Fedaykin, follow me!”\nIt turned out there were six Fedaykin in the room, and five of them won through behind her.\nWhen I am weaker than you, | ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, | take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.\n—WORDS OF AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER (ATTRIBUTED BY HARQ AL-ADA TO ONE LOUIS VEUILLOT)\neto leaned out the covert exit from the sietch, saw the\nbight of the cliff towering above his limited view. Late afternoon sunlight cast long shadows in the cliff’s vertical Striations. A skeleton butterfly flew in and out of the shadows, its webbed wings a transparent lacery against the light. How delicate that butterfly was to exist here, he thought.\nDirectly ahead of him lay the apricot orchard, with children working there to gather the fallen fruit. Beyond the orchard was the qanat. He and Ghanima had given the slip to their guards by losing themselves in a sudden crush of incoming workers. It had been a relatively simple matter to worm their way down an air passage to its connection with the steps to the covert exit. Now they had only to mingle themselves with the children, work their way to the qanat and drop into the tunnel. There they could move beside the predator fish which kept sandtrout from encysting the tribe’s irrigation water. No Fremen would yet think of a human risking accidental immersion in water.\nHe stepped out of the protective passages. The cliff stretched away on both sides of him, turned horizontal just by the act of his own movement.\nGhanima moved closely behind him. Both carried small fruit baskets woven of spice-fiber, but each basket carried a\nsealed package: Fremkit, maula pistol, crysknife ... and the new robes sent by Farad’n.\nGhanima followed her brother into the orchard, mingled with the working children. Stillsuit masks concealed every face. They were just two more workers here, but she felt the action drawing her life away from protective boundaries and known ways. What a simple step it was, that step from one danger into another!\nIn their baskets those new garments sent by Farad’n conveyed a purpose well understood by both of them. Ghanima had accented this knowledge by sewing their personal motto, “We Share,” in Chakobsa above the hawk crest at each breast.\nIt would be twilight soon and, beyond the qanat which marked off sietch cultivation, there would come a special quality of evening which few places in the universe could match. It would be that softly lighted desert world with its persistent solitude, its saturated sense that each creature in it was alone in a new universe.\n“We've been seen,” Ghanima whispered, bending to work beside her brother.\n“Guards?”\n“No—others.”\n“Good.”\n“We must move swiftly,” she said.\nLeto acknowledged this by moving away from the cliff through the orchard. He thought with his father’s thoughts: Everything remains mobile in the desert or perishes. Far out on the sand he could see The Attendant’s outcropping, reminder of the need for mobility. The rocks lay static and rigid in their watchful enigma, fading yearly before the onslaught of wind-driven sand. One day The Attendant would be sand.\nAs they neared the qanat they heard music from a high entrance of the sietch. It was an old-style Fremen group— two-holed flutes, tambourines, tympani made on spice-\nplastic drums with skins stretched taut across one end. No one asked what animal on this planet provided that much Skin.\nStilgar will remember what | told him about that cleft in The Attendant, Leto thought. He’// come in the dark when it’s too late—and then he'll know.\nPresently they were at the qanat. They slipped into an open tube, climbed down the inspection ladder to the service ledge. It was dusky, damp, and cold in the qanat and they could hear the predator fish splashing. Any sandtrout trying to steal this water would find its water-softened inner surface attacked by the fish. Humans must be wary of them, too.\n“Careful,” Leto said, moving down the slippery ledge. He fastened his memory to times and places his flesh had never known. Ghanima followed.\nAt the end of the qanat they stripped to their stillsuits and put on the new robes. They left the old Fremen robes behind as they climbed out another inspection tube, wormed their way over a dune and down the far side. There they sat shielded from the sietch, strapped on maula pistols and crysknives, slipped the Fremkit packs onto their shoulders. They no longer could hear the music.\nLeto arose, struck out through the valley between the dunes.\nGhanima fell into step behind him, moving with practiced unrhythmical quiet over the open sand.\nBelow the crest of each dune they bent low and crept across into the hidden lee, there to pause and peer backward seeking pursuit. No", " fish. Humans must be wary of them, too.\n“Careful,” Leto said, moving down the slippery ledge. He fastened his memory to times and places his flesh had never known. Ghanima followed.\nAt the end of the qanat they stripped to their stillsuits and put on the new robes. They left the old Fremen robes behind as they climbed out another inspection tube, wormed their way over a dune and down the far side. There they sat shielded from the sietch, strapped on maula pistols and crysknives, slipped the Fremkit packs onto their shoulders. They no longer could hear the music.\nLeto arose, struck out through the valley between the dunes.\nGhanima fell into step behind him, moving with practiced unrhythmical quiet over the open sand.\nBelow the crest of each dune they bent low and crept across into the hidden lee, there to pause and peer backward seeking pursuit. No hunters had emerged upon the desert by the time they reached the first rocks.\nIn the shadows of the rocks they worked their way around The Attendant, climbed to a ledge looking out upon the desert. Colors blinked far out on the bled. The darkening air held the fragility of fine crystal. The landscape which met their gaze was beyond pity, nowhere did it pause—no\nhesitations in it at all. The gaze stayed upon no single place in its scanning movements across that immensity.\nIt is the horizon of eternity, Leto thought.\nGhanima crouched beside her brother, thinking: The attack will come soon. She listened for the slightest sound, her whole body transformed into a single sense of taut probing.\nLeto sat equally alert. He knew now the culmination of all the training which had gone into the lives he shared so intimately. In this wilderness one developed a firm dependence upon the senses, a// of the senses. Life became a hoard of stored perceptions, each one linked only to momentary survival.\nPresently Ghanima climbed up the rocks and peered through a notch at the way they had come. The safety of the sietch seemed a lifetime away, a bulk of dumb cliffs rising out of the brown-purple distance, dust-blurred edges at the rim where the last of the sunlight cast its silver streaks. Still no pursuit could be seen in the intervening distance. She returned to Leto’s side.\n“It'll be a predatory animal,” Leto said. “That’s my tertiary computation.”\n“I think you stopped computing too soon,” Ghanima said. “It'll be more than one animal. House Corrino has learned not to put all of its hopes into a single bag.”\nLeto nodded agreement.\nHis mind felt suddenly heavy with the multitude of lives which his difference provided him: all of those lives, his even before birth. He was saturated with living and wanted to flee from his own consciousness. The inner world was a heavy beast which could devour him.\nRestlessly he arose, climbed to the notch Ghanima had used, peered at the cliffs of the sietch. Back there, beneath the cliff, he could see how the qanat drew a line between life and death. On the oasis edge he could see camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa. In the last of the\nlight he could make out the black movements of birds pick- hopping in the alfalfa. The distant grain tassels were ruffled by a wind which drew shadows that moved right up to the orchard. The motion caught at his awareness, and he saw that the shadows hid within their fluid form a larger change, and that larger change gave ransom to the turning rainbows of a silver-dusted sky.\nWhat will happen out here? he asked himself.\nAnd he knew it would either be death or the play of death, himself the object. Ghanima would be the one to return, believing the reality of a death she had seen or reporting sincerely from a deep hypnotic compulsion that her brother was, indeed, slain.\nThe unknowns of this place haunted him. He thought how easy it would be to succumb to the demand for prescience, to risk launching his awareness into an unchanging, absolute future. The small vision of his dream was bad enough, though. He knew he dared not risk the larger vision.\nPresently, he returned to Ghanima’s side.\n“No pursuit yet,” he said.\n“The beasts they send for us will be large,” Ghanima said. “We may have time to see them coming.”\n“Not if they come in the night.”\n“It'll be dark very soon,” she said.\n“Yes. It’s time we went down into our place.” He indicated the rocks to their left and below them where windsand had eaten a tiny cleft in the basalt. It was large enough to admit them, but small enough to keep out large creatures. Leto felt himself reluctant to go there, but knew it must be done. That was the place he’d pointed out to Stilgar.\n“They may really kill us,” he said.\n“This is the chance we have to take,” she said. “We owe it to our father.”\n“l'm not arguing.”\nAnd he thought: This is the correct path; we do the right thing. But he knew how dangerous it was to be right in this\nuniverse. Their survival now demanded vigor and fitness and an understanding of the limitations in every moment. Fremen ways were their best armor, and the Bene Gesserit knowledge was a force held in reserve. They were both thinking now as Atreides-trained battle veterans with no other defenses than a Fremen toughness which was not even hinted at by their childish bodies and their formal attire.\nLeto fingered the hilt of the poison-tipped crysknife at his waist. Unconsciously Ghanima duplicated the gesture.\n“Shall we go down now?” Ghanima asked. As she spoke she saw the movement far below them, small movement made less threatening by distance. Her stillness alerted Leto before she could utter a warning.\n“Tigers,” he said.\n“Laza tigers,” she corrected him.\n“They see us,” he said.\n“We'd better hurry,” she said. “A maula would never stop those creatures. They will’ve been well trained for this.”\n“They'll have a human director somewhere around,” he said, leading the way at a fast lope down the rocks to the left.\nGhanima agreed, but kept it to herself, saving her strength. There’d be a human around somewhere. Those tigers couldn’t be allowed to run free until the proper moment.\nThe tigers moved fast in the last of the light, leaping from rock to rock. They were eye-minded creatures and soon it would be night, the time of the ear-minded. The bell-call of a nightbird came from The Attendant’s rocks to emphasize the change. Creatures of the darkness already were hustling in the shadows of the etched crevasses.\nStill the tigers remained visible to the running twins. The animals flowed with power, a rippling sense of golden sureness in every movement.\nLeto felt that he had stumbled into this place to free himself from his soul. He ran with the sure knowledge that he and Ghanima could reach their narrow notch in time, but his gaze kept returning with fascination to the oncoming beasts.\nOne stumble and we're lost, he thought.\nThat thought reduced the sureness of his knowledge, and he ran faster.\nYou Bene Gesserit call your activity of the Panoplia Prophetica a “Science of Religion.” Very well. |, a seeker after another kind of scientist, find this an appropriate definition. You do, indeed, build your own myths, but so do all societies. You | must warn, however. You are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved. Your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of [away from] life. It is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess: One cannot have a single thing without its opposite.\n—THE PREACHER AT ARRAKEEN: A MESSAGE TO THE SISTERHOOD\n| n the hour before dawn, Jessica sat immobile on a worn rug of spice-cloth. Around her were the bare rocks of an old and poor sietch, one of the original settlements. It lay below the rim of Red Chasm, sheltered from the westerlies of the desert. Al-Fali and his brothers had brought her here; now they awaited word from Stilgar. The Fedaykin had moved cautiously in the matter of communication, however. Stilgar was not to know their location.\nThe Fedaykin already knew they were under a procès- verbal, an official report of crimes against the Imperium. Alia was taking the tack that her mother had been suborned by enemies of the realm, although the Sisterhood had not yet been named. The high-handed, tyrannical nature of Alia’s power was out in the open, however, and her belief that because she controlled the Priesthood she controlled the Fremen was about to be tested.\nJessica’s message to Stilgar had been direct and simple: “My daughter is possessed and must be put to the trial.”\nFears destroyed values, though, and it already was known that some Fremen would prefer not to believe this accusation. Their attempts to use the accusation as a\npassport had brought on two battles during the night, but the ornithopters al-Fali’s people had stolen had brought the fugitives to this precarious safety: Red Chasm Sietch. Word was going out to the Fedaykin from here, but fewer than two hundred of them remained on Arrakis. The others held posts throughout the Empire.\nReflecting upon these facts, Jessica wondered if she had come to the place of her death. Some of the Fedaykin believed it, but the death commandos accepted this easily enough. Al-Fali had merely grinned at her when some of his young men voiced their fears.\n“When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature’s wants to direct him to that place,” the old Naib had said.\nThe patched curtains at her doorway rustled; al-Fali entered. The old man’s narrow, windburned face appeared drawn, his eyes feverish. Obviously he had not rested.\n“Someone comes,” he said.\n“From Stilgar?”\n“Perhaps.” He lowered his eyes, glanced leftward in the manner of the old Fremen who brought bad news.\n“What is it?” Jessica demanded.\n“We have word from Tabr that your grandchildren are not there.” He spoke without looking at her.\n“Alia...”\n“She has ordered that the twins be given over to her custody, but Sietch Tabr reports that the children are not there. That is all we know.”\n“Stilgar’s sent them into the desert,” Jessica said.\n“Possibly, but it is known that he was searching for them all through the night. Perhaps it was a trick on his part... .”\n“That’s not Stilgar’s way,” she said, and thought: Unless the twins put him up to it. But that didn’t feel right either. She wondered at herself: no sensations of panic to suppress, and her fears for the twins were tempered by what Ghanima had revealed. She peered up at al-Fali, found him studying\nher with pity in his eyes. She said: “They’ve gone into the desert by themselves.”\n“Alone? Those two children!”\nShe did not bother to explain that “those two children” probably knew more about desert survival than most living Fremen. Her thoughts were fixed, instead, on Leto’s odd behavior when he’d insisted that she allow herself to be abducted. She’d put the memory aside, but this moment demanded it. He’d said she would know the moment to obey him.\n“The messenger should be in the sietch by now,” al-Fali said. “I will bring him to you.” He let"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_b38bc42e8e19ae04982239a90a7e1d1a5a7558d54da48e17f6943c477697739f_v2"}
