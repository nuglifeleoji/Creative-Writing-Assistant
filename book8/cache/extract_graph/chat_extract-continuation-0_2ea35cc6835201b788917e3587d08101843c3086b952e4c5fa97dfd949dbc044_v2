�完美的遮掩了三人的身形。从通道另一边如果是向这边看的话，只会觉得在通道尽头这边是死胡同，然后有一堆石块，仅此而已。\n\n    蓝轩宇把先前那石像用的石斧拽在自己身边，石斧沉重，但以他的力量还是拿得动的。就当是武器了，感觉还不错。\n\n    此时，训练场内，七、八位老师正关注着面前的大屏幕。\n\n    大屏幕分成是个，完全展现着里面十组人的不同动态。\n\n    老师们忽而点头认可，忽而摇头皱眉，显然对学员们的应变反应都有着不同的看法。\n\n    牧重天的目光始终都注视在蓝轩宇这一组之中，有了之前的情况，他对蓝轩宇的重视程度显然要超过一般学员。\n\n    蓝轩宇能够拿到两个十加的成绩，还是令他相当意外的。他也没想到，蓝轩宇居然有这样的水平。\n\n    第一学期，能不被淘汰就很不错了。毕竟，他的魂力到现在才只有十四级。这对于高能少年班来说，实在是低了一些。\n\n    据他所知，修为最高的吕千寻，现在魂力都已经突破十九级，再进一步就要到二环境界了。这种等级，才是学院愿意看到的。\n\n    为了培养高能少年班这些学生们，学院不只是调集了初级学院的最强师资力量，甚至连中级学院的一些老师都被选派了过来。现在高能少年班上的机甲课，都是中级学院才会教导的。\n\n    这次期中考试学院非常重视，此时，站在众多老师中央的那一位，就是学院的副院长。\n\n    三个月的集训，精挑细选的学生，学院希望看到的是他们能有脱胎换骨的变化，未来才好为学院争光添彩啊！\n\n    牧重天自然清晰地看到了蓝轩宇他们在面对石像时候的应变。\n\n    “咦，这刘锋的攻击力……”牧重天很快就注意到，当刘锋二次攻击石像的时候，攻击力大幅度增强的情况。\n\n    这石像的整体设置确实是不强，因为考虑到学生们主要还是相互战斗最为重要，不能把迷宫本身弄的太厉害，否则大家都没有碰面的机会就不好了。\n\n    可是，这解决的速度也太快了一些吧。刘锋刚刚的攻势，已经完全不像之前了，这是怎么回事？\n\n\n------------\n\n第一百零五章 副院长\n\n    然后牧重天就看到，蓝轩宇三人“苟”在石堆后面坐了下来。不禁有些哭笑不得的感觉。这三个小子，倒真的是狡猾。但他也不得不承认，在迷宫之中选择这样的战术似乎是最为正确的。\n\n    此时，其他九组学员都在迷宫中行进，寻找着对手，也寻找着出路。也有其他人击溃石像的。甚至有两组学员都已经碰面了。\n\n    大家都希望能够在实战考核中有所表现，苦练三个月了，谁不想一鸣惊人？每个人都牟足了劲。\n\n    所\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
