体必须第一时间进行大脑修复和器官修复，才有可能活过来。超低温冷冻保存最好的是血液，伤害最大的是大脑。第一时间未能修复大脑的话，复生可能性连百分之一都没有。除非是冰冻了只有几个小时。更何况，这个实验体已经被冰冻了几千年。给她准备的修复液都是加强型的，现在无法注入身体内部，只是在外部浸泡，效果肯定是差得多了。\n\n    伴随着培养皿内魂导能量注入，开始散发出淡淡的白色光晕。\n\n    首席科学家叹息一声，“我们还是大意了，没有考虑到这种情况。这个实验体很可能很不一般，甚至有可能是魂兽修炼成人，所以身体强度才会如此之高。现在换针已经来不及了。早知道就应该向总部申请最高强度的输液针。这个责任，我来承担。”\n\n    “首席，您别这么说，大家都没考虑到这个问题，有什么责任咱们也该一起承担啊！”在他身边一名中年人赶忙说道。\n\n    “等一下，你们看。”突然，另一边一名老年女性科学家突然指向培养皿。\n\n    众位科学家的目光随之看去，他们惊讶的发现，原本培养皿内浑浊的液体突然变得通透起来，里面的人形也开始变得越发清晰。\n\n    “这是……”\n\n    当那人形渐渐露出本来模样的时候，所有人都不禁看的有些呆住了。\n\n    那是一名少女，一名绝美的少女。先前因为封在厚厚的冰层之中，并不能看到她全部样貌。\n\n    她的身体被一层银色长裙所覆盖，头发也是银色的，身材修长。虽然双眸紧闭，可那长长的睫毛还是有种动人心魄的感觉。在场所有男性科研人员的目光都不由自主的被她吸引了过去，一时间，不由得目瞪口呆。\n\n    “快，加大魂导能量注入。她好像在自行吸收培养皿内的营养液，重新更换营养液，快！”首席科学家几乎是疯狂的叫出声，也同时唤醒了呆滞中的科学家们。\n\n    实验室内又重新变得忙碌起来，科学家们飞快的行动起来。\n\n    培养皿内被重新注入营养液，魂导能量更是持续注入。但是，诡异的情况出现了，无论那营养液如何注入，培养皿内的液体却始终都是清澈的。那少女的身体仿佛星辰大海一般，吞噬着所有的营养成分和被注入的魂导能量。\n\n    这个过程，整整过了一个小时。\n\n    “你们看，她、她刚刚好像皱了下眉？”一名眼尖的青年科学家突然指着培养皿说道。\n\n    根本不需要去证明他的话，因为下一瞬，通过传音器材，轻微的心跳声响了起来，“咚咚、咚咚、咚咚。”\n\n    对于科学家们来说，这简直就是天籁之音啊！更让他们惊喜的是，培养皿内的少女的睫毛动了动，缓缓睁开了她的眼�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
