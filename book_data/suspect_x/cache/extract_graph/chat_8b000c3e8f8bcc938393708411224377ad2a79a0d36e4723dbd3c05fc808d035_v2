Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.”\nPaul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: “I have to have someone | can say these things to, Son.” He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now—\ntrampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.\n“On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,” the Duke said. “Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House—running, hunted.”\nPaul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.\n“To hold Arrakis,” the Duke said, “one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect.” He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. “That honorable banner could come to mean many evil things.”\nPaul swallowed in a dry throat. His father’s words carried futility, a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.\nThe Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. “Power and fear,” he said. “The tools of Statecraft. | must order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you. That filmclip there—they call you ‘Mahdi’—‘Lisan al-Gaib’—as a last resort, you might capitalize on that.”\nPaul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.\n“What’s keeping that ecologist?” the Duke muttered. “I told Thufir to have him here early.”\nMy father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and | sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. | marked the strong resemblance between them—my father and this man in the portrait—both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. “Princess-daughter,” my father said, “l would that you’d been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.” My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and | was but 14, yet | remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.\n—FROM “IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nH is first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr. Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitted the ancient prophecy so precisely. He had “the questing eyes,” and the air of “reserved candor.”\nOf course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene. Still, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.\nThey met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field’s administration building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and the faint air- distortion of a shield around him.\nKynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for them there!\nThe planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back. He strode on ahead toward the building’s entrance—the dark hole in plastic- coated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less suitable than a cave.\nMovement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.\nThe entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them heavily armed—slow- pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them came a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a free-swinging, striding rhythm.\nBeside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the face. The youth seemed Small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others. And he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with\ncasual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing.\n“The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see,” went the prophecy.\nKynes shook his head, telling himself: They’re just people.\nWith the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized—Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.\n“You may Call the Duke ‘my Lord’ or ‘Sire.’ ‘Noble Born’ also ts correct, but usually reserved for more formal occasions. The son may be addressed as ‘young Master’ or ‘my Lord.’ The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks little familiarity.\nAnd Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They'll learn soon enough who’s master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that Mentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do they?\nThe import of Hawat’s questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the Imperial bases. And it was obvious they’d learned of the bases from Idaho.\n| will have Stilgar send Idaho’s head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.\nThe ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots crunching the sand.\nKynes bowed. “My Lord, Duke.”\nAs he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit, and low\nboots. The man’s hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side, revealing long sandy hair, a Sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless blue- within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets.\n“You're the ecologist,” the Duke said.\n“We prefer the old title here, my Lord,” Kynes said. “Planetologist.”\n“As you wish,” the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. “Son, this is the Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.” He glanced at Kynes. “And this is my son.”\n“My Lord,” Kynes said.\n“Are you a Fremen?” Paul asked.\nKynes smiled. “I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But | am in His Majesty’s service, the Imperial Planetologist.”\nPaul nodded, impressed by the man’s air of strength. Halleck had pointed Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: “The man standing there with the Fremen escort—the one moving now toward the ornithopter.”\nPaul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul’s ear: “Odd sort of fellow. Has a precise way of speaking—clipped off, no fuzzy edges—razor-apt.”\nAnd the Duke, behind them, had said: “Scientist type.”\nNow, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the impact of personality, as\nthough he were blood royal, born to command.\n“I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,” the Duke said.\n“I hope they fit well, my Lord,” Kynes said. “They're of Fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.”\n“I was concerned that you said you couldn’t take us into the desert unless we wore these garments,” the Duke said. “We can carry plenty of water. We don’t intend to be out long and we'll have air cover— the escort you see overhead right now. It isn’t likely we'd be forced down.”\nKynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: “You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.”\nHalleck stiffened. “The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!”\nLeto gave Halleck their private hand signal to desist, said: “Our ways are new here, Gurney. We must make allowances.”\n“As you wish, Sire.”\n“We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes,” Leto said. “These suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered.”\nOn impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said: “‘The gift is the blessing of the giver.’”\nThe words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: “Lisan al-Gaib!”\nKynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the building.\n“Most interesting,” Leto said.\nKynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: “Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They mean no harm.” But he thought of the words of the legend: “They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing.”\nLeto’s assessment of Kynes—based partly on Hawat’s brief verbal report (guarded and full of Suspicions)—suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas—but it had seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul’s question had been direct and pertinent.\nKynes had gone native.\n“Shouldn’t we be going, Sire?” Halleck asked.\nThe Duke nodded. “I'll fly my own ‘thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.”\n“One moment, please,” Kynes said. “With your permission, Sire, | must check the security of your Suits.”\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: “I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours...\nmy Lord. I’m well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care.”\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet...to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?\nThe thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. “We're in your hands,” the Duke\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8b000c3e8f8bcc938393708411224377ad2a79a0d36e4723dbd3c05fc808d035_v2"}
