第48章\n　　在地区医院的急诊室里，李登云在儿子刚躺过的那张小床上，好不容易才缓过气来。 \n　　看他挣扎着要下床，卫生局的干事和小车司机，就把他扶到椅子上。 \n　　坐在椅子上的李登云绝望而痛苦。他脸色灰白，平时不太明显的几块老年斑，现在很突出地散布在两鬓旁边。巨大的打击顷刻间就把他完全变成了一个老年人。 \n　　人的命运啊！谁知什么时候大祸就降临到你的头上？在他们老两口快进入垂暮之年时，他们的独生儿子却失去了双腿。人常说养儿防老。可他们老了还得侍候儿子。他们自己受点罪又算什么！反正行将就木，歪歪好好这辈子凑合着已经活完了。可儿子还没活人哩！他今年才三十一岁，正是人生的黄金岁月…… \n　　那边的手术正在进行中。李登云脸上挂着泪痕，目光呆痴地坐在这边的椅子上。此刻，他都真的有点相信命运了。他悲观而看破红尘地想，人一辈子都是瞎话哩！谁能掌握了自己的命运？哼，人常常为了一点小小的利益和欲望，就在那里机关算尽，你争我夺，喜怒无常，实在是可笑！一切都是命里注定的！ \n　　可是，冥冥之中真的有什么神灵安排凡人的命运，为什么不让他自己失去双腿，而偏偏让他的儿子失去双腿呢？老天爷，你太残忍了！ \n　　李登云悲哀地想起，他儿子的一生是多么不幸。后半生不用说，将成为一个残废人。就是前半生，也活得可怜呀！虽说结婚已经几年，连个夫妻生活也没有过，更不要说生儿育女了。 \n　　登云还不知道，向前正是因为爱情苦闷喝醉了酒，才把汽车开翻的——如果他知道这一点，他更会把田福军的侄女恨到骨头里！ \n　　眼下他想到这个所谓的“儿媳妇”的时候，只是在心中怨恨地说：哼，这下你可以走你的阳关道了！你把我的儿子折磨得好苦哇！ \n　　李登云想起润叶，气就不打一处来。如果她和儿子感情好，向前今生一世也能多少得到一点女人的温暖……唉，说来说去，这也怨自己的人！向前要是同意离婚，等不到润叶滚蛋，就会有新媳妇进门来！可是儿子偏偏被这个女妖怪迷住了，宁愿受罪也不离婚，他和志英实在是没办法呀！正是为了迁就儿子，他老两口才奔跑着调到黄原来工作了。因为“儿媳妇”调到了团地委，老两口划算他们调上来后，再活动着把向前也调到黄原，这样，向前和润叶在一个城市里，就能多见面\n######################\nOutput:",
