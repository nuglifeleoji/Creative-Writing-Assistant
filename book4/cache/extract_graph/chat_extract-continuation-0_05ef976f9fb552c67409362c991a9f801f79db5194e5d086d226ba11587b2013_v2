\n　　兰香给她的同学介绍说：“这是我二哥！” \n　　“我叫吴仲平。”这年轻人很热情地握住了少平的手。“我们是一个班的。”兰香在旁边补充说。 \n　　“我再去买几个菜，你能喝酒吗？”吴仲平问他。少平对他点点头。 \n　　不一会，吴仲平就端来几大盘菜，又提了两瓶青岛啤酒，三个人便坐在一起吃起来。 \n　　少平大为惊讶的是，他没想到妹妹已经出息得这么大方，竟然和一个男同学亲密到如此程度了！ \n　　这就是他那吊着泪珠、提着小筐筐拾柴禾的妹妹吗？他似乎都不认识她了。 \n　　不知为什么，他感到眼窝有点发热。他为妹妹的成长感到欣慰。她也许是家族中的第一个真正脱离黄土壤的人。妹妹的这种变化，正是他老早就对她所希望的。在这一刹那间，他自己的一切不幸都退远了。为了有这样值得骄傲的妹妹，他也应该满怀热情地去生活……第二天上午，兴高采烈的妹妹陪他去上街。在此之前，她已引他转游了他们美丽如画的校园。 \n　　行走在大城市五光十色的街道上，少平倒不象初来乍到时那般缩手缩脚。他是一个有文化的人，很快便知道这个世界大约是怎么一回事。唯一使他感到别扭的是，行人用那种误解的目光把他和妹妹看成了情侣。 \n　　兰香大方而亲切地挽着他的胳膊，不时给他指点街道上的情景。她穿一件天蓝色裙子和白短袖衫，稍稍烫过的黑发刚漫过脖项，朴素中漾溢着青春的光彩。 \n　　走到一个叫骡马市的地方，少平坚持要带妹妹去看一看衣服。 \n　　这是一个个体户出售成衣的大市场，街道两旁花花绿绿摆得一眼望不到头。衣服大都是广州上海一带进来的。还有一些香港和外国的冒牌货，价钱稍贵一些，但式样相当时髦。 \n　　兰香说她夏衣足够，少平就给她买了两条牛仔裤和一件高雅的春秋衫。 \n　　妹妹红着脸说：“我还没穿过牛仔裤……” \n　　“你穿牛仔裤肯定好看！不过，假期回双水村，可不要把这裤子穿回去。村里人不用说，就冲咱们家里人也看不惯！”少平笑着对妹妹说。 \n　　这天下午，妹妹安排他们到市中心的流花公园去划船。在此这前，她的男朋友吴仲平已经提前到公园租船去了。兰香还给金秀打了电话，约好在公园湖边的游船售票处碰面。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
