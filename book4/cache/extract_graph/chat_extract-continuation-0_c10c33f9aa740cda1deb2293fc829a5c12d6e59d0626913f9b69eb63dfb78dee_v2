\n　　“那为什么你亲自跑来找我？”少平有点纳闷。“回去咱们一块办砖厂！” \n　　噢，原来是这！ \n　　少平卷起一支烟，寻思着说：“我的户口已经迁到了黄原。再说……” \n　　“户口好办！迁回去不就行了？” \n　　少安说着，也卷了一支旱烟卷。 \n　　“我已经习惯外面的这种生活……”少平说。 \n　　“这外面有个什么好处？受死受活，你能赚几个钱？回去咱们合伙办砖厂，用不了几年，要什么有什么！”“钱当然很重要，这我不是不知道；我一天何尝不为钱而受熬苦！可是，我又觉得，人活这一辈子，还应该有些另外的什么才对……” \n　　“另外的什么？” \n　　“我也一时说不清楚……” \n　　“唉，都是因为书念得太多了！” \n　　“也许是……” \n　　“我不愿意看着你在外面过这种流浪汉日子……”“不知为什么，我又情愿这样……” \n　　一阵长时间的沉默。弟兄俩鼻子口里喷云吐雾，各想各的心事；也想对方的心事。生活使他们相聚在一块，但他们又说不到一块。两个人现在挨得这么近，想法却又相距十万八千里…… \n　　“那这样说，我这趟黄原算是白跑了？”少安问。“哥，你的一片好心我全能理解哩！可是我求你，让我闯荡一段时间再……” \n　　“那又会有什么结果？” \n　　“说不定能找到个什么出路……” \n　　“出路？”少安不由淡然一笑，“咱们农民的后代，出路只能在咱们的土地上。公家那碗饭咱们不好吃！”“我倒不是梦想入公家门。” \n　　“那又是为什么？” \n　　“唉，我还是给你说不清楚呀！” \n　　少安长叹了一口气。 \n　　过了一会，他又问少平：“你月月给兰香寄钱吗？”“不多。一月寄十块。”
