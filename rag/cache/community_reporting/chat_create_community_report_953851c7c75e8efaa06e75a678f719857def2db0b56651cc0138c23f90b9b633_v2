The book achieved significant commercial success, becoming the top-selling hardback in science fiction history at the time of its publication. As part of the acclaimed *Dune* series, *Children of Dune* expands upon the complex political, ecological, and philosophical themes that define Herbert's work, further exploring the legacy of Paul Atreides and the future of the desert planet Arrakis.
