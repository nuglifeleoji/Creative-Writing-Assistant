第22章\n　　孙少安万万没有想到，公社突然派人来丈量他们队的猪饲料地。几天前他就听福高说，大庄河他姨夫因给社员多划了猪饲料地，被公社叫去盘查了一天。他心里一直担心这件事，但这件事还是发生了。公社刚来人时，他以为是他们队谁告了状，但又听说公社在其它队也普查猪饲料地的情况，只好硬着头皮等着挨戳了。 \n　　这多年来，提起猪就能把人愁死。先前，公社每年根据国家要求，给每个大队硬行分配生猪交售任务。反正不管三七二十一，到年底平均两户按标准交售一口肥猪。喂肥一口猪得多少粮啊！这年头，人都没粮吃，怎能有猪吃的粮食呢？但没办法，国家要拿猪肉支援第三世界，每年的任务非完成不行。谁家完不成任务，就要把人口粮扣除一部分。 \n　　没有人喂得起猪。队里没办法，由田福堂出面给公社做工作，看能不能用生产队集体的羊来顶猪。公社通了人情，说可以，但必须用绵羊来顶。一年下来，全村的绵羊就快绝了种。 \n　　看来这不是办法，还得要落实到家户来养猪。 \n　　大队小队干部没明没黑地开会，但连一户也落实不了。金俊山提出，是不是队干部先带个头，一人应承喂一口猪，然后再做社员的工作。但其他干部都讥讽他说：你有能力带这个革命头哩！我们没能力！再说，当干部一晚上开会熬眼已经够了，还带这个头！你要带你带吧！最好你金俊山一家人办个猪场，把队里的任务都包了！ \n　　金俊山立刻张口结舌退到大队部的灶火圪崂里，再不吭声了。 \n　　还是孙玉亭有办法，提出用抓纸蛋的方式来解决这个问题。大家想来想去，再没有好办法，就只好采纳了孙玉亭的建议。 \n　　抓纸蛋的时候，全村人象进行一次集体占卜活动。一个个提心吊胆，用颤抖的手，在大队办公窑炕桌上那只不祥的黑老碗里，如同抓自己的命运一般，一人抓回一个揉成一团的小纸蛋。有的人展开纸团，笑得鼻子涎水都顾不得揩；有的人一下子脸象黑霜打了一般；甚至还有抱住头当场哭得鼻子一把泪一把的。提出这个绝妙办法的孙玉亭，几乎年年能“抓”到一头猪，回去常常让贺凤英骂得狗血喷头。 \n　　到了年底，庄稼人好不容易把猪喂起来，吆到石圪节去交售。为了达到标准斤称，交售的那天，每家人都给猪好吃好喝一顿——说不定几斤粮食就能决定一口猪能否够斤称。但是，由公社粮站和\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
