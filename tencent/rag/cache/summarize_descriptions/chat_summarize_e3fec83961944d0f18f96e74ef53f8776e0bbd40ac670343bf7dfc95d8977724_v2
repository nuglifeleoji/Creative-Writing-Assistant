A **ghola** is a genetically engineered clone, typically grown from the cells of a deceased individual, and is a hallmark of the Tleilaxu's mastery over genetic manipulation. These clones are often produced for specific purposes, including serving the interests of powerful groups such as the **Bene Gesserit**, who frequently employ gholas for their own agendas.  \n\nOne of the most notable examples of a ghola is **Duncan Idaho**, a recurring figure replicated multiple times by the Tleilaxu, demonstrating their ability to preserve and resurrect individuals with precision. The Tleilaxu's expertise in genetic engineering allows them to not only recreate physical forms but also potentially restore memories and consciousness, making gholas highly valuable.  \n\nWhile the Tleilaxu primarily control the production of gholas, their creations are often utilized by external factions, highlighting their role as suppliers of advanced biological technology. Despite their secretive nature, their reputation for crafting gholas underscores their dominance in genetic sciences within the *Dune* universe. The process remains exclusive to the Tleilaxu, reinforcing their status as unparalleled experts in cloning and genetic resurrection.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251968, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 531, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 125}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
