无心做活，只是到这里来躲避某种在他看来类似灾祸一般的事件。他不时把锄撂到地里，蹲在地畔上的玉米林中，忧心忡忡地看着对面那片乱得象马蜂窝似的人群和那块高悬在人头上的“耍电影”的白布帐。在这全村欢腾喜庆的日子里，蹲在这里的他简直就象个不吉祥的怪物。而老汉自己瞅着对面人群头上的那块白布，也奇怪地联想起丧事上的孝布。 \n　　他嘴里吸了一口凉气，浑身打了一个寒颤……这时，在东拉河这面人头攒动的场地上，孙玉亭一脸庄严点燃了他那把破扫帚，交给了侄儿。一股呛人的煤油味弥漫在空气之中。孙少安尊敬地将火把又传递给周县长。县长满面笑容走到烧砖窑口，点燃了炉火。人群中立刻掀起了一片喧哗声。干部们举起胳膊使劲鼓掌。整个点火过程的形式，倒象是召开奥林匹克运动会！ \n　　接下来，村、乡、县各级领导先后都即席发表了热情洋溢的讲话——当然都是表彰孙少安和贺秀莲的。 \n　　等最后讲话的周县长话音一落，孙玉亭就指挥人放开了炮。一霎时，噼噼叭叭的炮声，人群的喧闹声，加上熊熊的炉火、飘飞的硝烟和乱脚淌起的黄尘，把这个“点火仪式”的热闹气氛推向了高潮……我们发现，刚才代表双水村“致词”的是羊奶喝得红光满面的金俊山（他已成了奶羊专业户）。 \n　　那么，有这么多“上级领导”光临的大好场面，而且就在双水村，村里的党支书田福堂岂能不在这里露脸呢？当然，我们也知道，他一直和孙少安有隔阂。但是，福堂向来是个精明的政治家，他不会因脸皮就连“大场面”都不顾——他终归还是双水村的“一把手”嘛！ \n                  第15章\n　　在孙少安砖场的“点火仪式”闹翻了双水村的时候，田福堂正一个人躺在他家院墙外那个破碾盘上，无声无息地晒太阳。 \n　　他的状况看起来十分令人震惊。 \n　　福堂的身体是完全垮了。他瘦得象一根干柴棒，原来合身的衣服如今显得袍褂一般宽松。脸色苍白不说，还蒙着一层灰暗；多时没刮剃的胡须乱糟糟地脸上围了一圈。碾盘旁边的土地上，吐下一堆肮脏的粘痰。 \n　　他半闭着眼睛，蜷曲在这个早年间就废弃的破碾盘上，一动也不动。如果不是那干瘪的胸脯还在起伏，我们会以为他不再是个活人。 \n　　夏日的阳光�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙玉亭<|>PERSON<|>孙玉亭 is a
