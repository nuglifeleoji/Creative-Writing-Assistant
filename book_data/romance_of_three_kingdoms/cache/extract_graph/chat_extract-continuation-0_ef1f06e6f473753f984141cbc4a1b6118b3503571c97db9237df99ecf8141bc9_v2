武尸首，孙权知陈武已亡，董袭又沉江而死，哀痛至切，令人入水中寻见董袭尸首，与陈武尸一齐厚葬之。又感周泰救护之功，设宴款之。权亲自把盏，抚其背，泪流满面，曰：“卿两番相救，不惜性命，被枪数十，肤如刻画，孤亦何心不待卿以骨肉之恩、委卿以兵马之重乎！卿乃孤之功臣，孤当与卿共荣辱、同休戚也。”言罢，令周泰解衣与众将观之：皮肉肌肤，如同刀剜，盘根遍体。孙权手指其痕，一一问之。周泰具言战斗被伤之状。一处伤令吃一觥酒。是日，周泰大醉。权以青罗伞赐之，令出入张盖，以为显耀。权在濡须，与操相拒月余，不能取胜。张昭，顾雍上言：“曹操势大，不可力取；若与久战，大损士卒：不若求和安民为上。”孙权从其言，令步骘往曹营求和，许年纳岁贡。操见江南急未可下，乃从之，令：“孙权先撤人马，吾然后班师。”步骘回覆，权只留蒋钦、周泰守濡须口，尽发大兵上船回秣陵。操留曹仁、张辽屯合淝，班师回许昌。文武众官皆议立曹操为魏王。尚书崔琰力言不可。众官曰：“汝独不见荀文若乎？”琰大怒曰：“时乎，时乎！会当有变，任自为之！”有与琰不和者，告知操。操大怒，收琰下狱问之。琰虎目虬髯，只是大骂曹操欺君奸贼。廷尉白操，操令杖杀崔琰在狱中。后人有赞曰：“清河崔琰，天性坚刚；虬髯虎目，铁石心肠；奸邪辟易，声节显昂；忠于汉主，千古名扬！”\n\n
