He questions whether Bijaz's own prescience is connected to the Dune Tarot, suggesting a broader, possibly mystical link between prescience and the Tarot's symbolism. Additionally, Paul's own prescient visions intersect with the Tarot's imagery, reflecting his internal conflict as he grapples with the weight of destiny and the choices before him. The Dune Tarot, therefore, serves as both a mirror and a catalyst for Paul's journey, embodying the tension between foresight and free will that defines his path.  \n\nThis summary harmonizes the descriptions, presenting the Dune Tarot as a symbolic framework that amplifies Paul's prescient struggles without contradiction. The focus remains on Paul's introspection and the Tarot's role in shaping his understanding of fate.
