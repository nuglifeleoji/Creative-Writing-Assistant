�晚。\n　　清晨起床后，汪淼努力使自己在家人面前显得正常些，但妻子还是看出了异样，问他的眼睛怎么了?是不是看不清东西?\n　　早饭后，汪淼向纳米中心请了假，开车去医院。一路上，幽灵倒计时无情地横在他眼中的现实世界前面，这东西会自动调节自己的亮度，在不同的背景上都清晰地显现出来。汪淼甚至盯着初升的太阳，试图使倒计时被强光暂时隐没一会儿，但没有用，那串魔鬼数字竟在日轮上显现出来，这时它不是增加亮度，而是变成黑色，更加恐怖。\n　　同仁医院很难挂号，汪淼直接找了妻子的一个同学，一位著名的眼科专家。他没有说病情，而是先让医生检查自己的眼睛。仔细检查了汪淼的双眼后，医生告诉他没有发现什么病变，眼睛一切正常。\n　　“我的眼睛总是看见一个东西，不管你看哪里，这东西都在。”汪淼说。同时，那串数字就横在医生脸前。\n　　1175:11:34、1175:11:33、1175:11:32、1175:l1:31……\n　　“飞蚊症。”医生说，同时抽出处方签开始写， “我们这年纪的常见眼病，晶状体混浊。不太好治，但没什么要紧的，开些碘药水和维D吧，也许能吸收掉，但希望不大。不过，这确实没什么要紧的，只要你习惯了忽略视野里的那些杂物，对视力没什么影响。”\n　　“你说的飞蚊症，那些……东西看上去是什么样子?”\n　　“不规则，因人而易，有时是小黑点儿，有时像蝌蚪。”\n　　“如果看到的是一串数字呢?”\n　　医生写处方的笔停了。\n　　“你看到一串数字?”\n　　“是的，横在视野中心。”\n　　医生推开纸和笔，关切地看着他， “一进来我就看出，你过度劳累。上次同学聚会，李瑶向我提起你，说你的工作压力很大。到我们这岁数，应该注意了，健康可透支不起了。”\n　　“你是说，我这是精神因素所致?”\n　　医生点点头， “要是一般的病人，我就建议他去精神科了，其实没必要，没什么要紧的，就是太累了。休息几天吧，去度几天假，和李瑶、孩子，叫什么来着，豆豆吧，一起去。放心，很快会恢复的。”\n　　1l75:10:02、1l75:10:01、ll75:10:00，1175:09:59……\n　　“我告诉你我看到的是什么，一个倒计时!一秒一秒，在精确地走!这会是精神因素?”\n　　医生宽容地笑笑， “想知道精神因素能对视力影响到什么程度吗?上个月我们收治了一个女孩儿，十五六岁吧，她在教室里突然间什么都看不见了，完全失明。可经过所有检查，眼睛在生理上完全正常。后来精神科的专家对她进行了一个月的心理治疗，又是突然间，她的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
