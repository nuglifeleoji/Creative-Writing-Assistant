\n　　田福军夫妇知道这个消息后，也很为他们的女儿高兴。事到如今，福军才猛然觉得，也许他的晓霞最合适的职业就是记者工作！这孩子思路敏捷，知识面也比她哥晓晨宽一些。另外，她性格泼辣，爱跑动，又不怕吃苦——这些都是搞记者工作所需要的。 \n　　实际上，当记者对田晓霞来说，也是她梦麻以求的理想职业！ \n　　没想到这个理想就这样变成了现实。命运往往就是如此——有的人事事不顺，有的人一顺百顺！ \n　　分配基本没什么大问题后，田晓霞愉快得都有点飘飘然了。也许用不了一个月，她就要离开黄原，到省城的报社去报到啦！ \n　　那么，她该怎样打发在黄原的这一段日子呢？ \n　　她很快想到了孙少平。 \n　　是的，她要尽量多些时间和少平在一块。她实习回来后还没顾上去找他。他当然也不知道她已经分到省报去当记者了。 \n　　晓霞想起少平的时候，心中就会涌上一种连她自己也急忙弄不清楚的复杂情绪。毫无疑问，在她已有的生活之中，没有一个男人象少平那样使她在感情上有一种亲近感。尤其是和他在黄原交往以来，每想到他，心中就会泛起一缕温热的情思。她的确还没有考虑好她和这个人未来的关系会怎样发展。但她感到她在生活中已经不能再失掉这个人。是的，从家庭和社会地位来说，他们的距离很大；可是从心灵方面说，没有一个人象他那样和自己接近。在我们的生活之中，还有什么能比得上人与人心灵的融洽更为珍贵呢？不是家庭、职业、社会地位和其它条件接近的人，相互间心灵就更能接近；而实际上，生活中常有的现象是，两个人尽管其它方面条件殊异，可心灵却往往能接近和相通——她和少平正是这样的。田晓霞决定立刻去找孙少平。 \n　　上次实习走前，少平告诉她，南关柴油机厂的活不久就要完工了。不知他现在是否还在那里？如果他已经离开了，她又上哪儿去找他呢？ \n　　但她又想，有一点是肯定的，他不会离开黄原城。只要他在这个城市里，她就一定要找到他！她在心里调皮地说：哼，孙少平，你插翅难飞！ \n　　其实，孙少平眼下仍然还在南关的柴油机厂干活。不过，用不了多少天，这里也就完工了——他现在正熬煎不久以后他到什么地方再箍个活干哩……当田晓霞找到这里的时候，少平正在工地上拉水泥板。他光着身子，只穿一件短裤，被太阳晒黑的身子流着肮脏的汗泥道。这副样子站在穿着裙子、打扮得花枝招展的晓\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
