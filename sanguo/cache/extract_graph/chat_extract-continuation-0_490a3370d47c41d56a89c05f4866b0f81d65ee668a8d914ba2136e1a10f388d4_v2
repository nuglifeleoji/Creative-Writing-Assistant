小宴，五日一大宴，上马一提金，下马一提银：如此恩礼，毕竟留之不住，听其斩关杀将而去，致使今日反为所逼，几欲迁都以避其锋。今主公既已擒之，若不即除，恐贻后患。”孙权沉吟半晌，曰：“斯言是也。”遂命推出。于是关公父子皆遇害。时建安二十四年冬十二月也。关公亡年五十八岁。后人有诗叹曰：“汉末才无敌，云长独出群：神威能奋武，儒雅更知文。天日心如镜，《春秋》义薄云。昭然垂万古，不止冠三分。”又有诗曰：“人杰惟追古解良，士民争拜汉云长。桃园一日兄和弟，俎豆千秋帝与王。气挟风雷无匹敌，志垂日月有光芒。至今庙貌盈天下，古木寒鸦几夕阳。”\n\n

却说关公一魂不散，荡荡悠悠，直至一处，乃荆门州当阳县一座山，名为玉泉山。山上有一老僧，法名普净，原是汜水关镇国寺中长老；后因云游天下，来到此处，见山明水秀，就此结草为庵，每日坐禅参道，身边只有一小行者，化饭度日。是夜月白风清，三更已后，普净正在庵中默坐，忽闻空中有人大呼曰：“还我头来！”普净仰面谛视，只见空中一人，骑赤兔马，提青龙刀，左有一白面将军、右有一黑脸虬髯之人相随，一齐按落云头，至玉泉山顶。普净认得是关公，遂以手中麈尾击其户曰：“云长安在？”关公英魂顿悟，即下马乘风落于庵前，叉手问曰：“吾师何人？愿求法号。”普净曰：“老僧普净，昔日汜水关前镇国寺中，曾与君侯相会，今日岂遂忘之耶？”公曰：“向蒙相救，铭感不忘。今某己遇祸而死，愿求清诲，指点迷途。”普净曰：“昔非今是，一切休论；后果前因，彼此不爽。今将军为吕蒙所害，大呼还我头来，然则颜良、文丑，五关六将等众人之头，又将向谁索耶？“于是关公恍然大悟，稽首皈依而去。后往往于玉泉山显圣护民，乡人感其德，就于山顶上建庙，四时\n######################\nOutput:",
