“蓝银草吗？”正在这时，一个带着些许茫然，却又十分悦耳的声音在蓝轩宇一家三口身后不远处响起。\n\n    蓝轩宇一家回身看时，只见两名女子站在那里，同样也在注视着他们看到的橱窗内蓝银草标本。\n\n    两名女子都是身材修长，左侧的一位，身穿白色连衣长裙，金色短发，蔚蓝色的眼眸，鼻尖处带着几颗俏皮的小雀斑，是那种带着几分英气的美，此时，她正看着身边同行的女子道：“蓝银草怎么了？”\n\n    与她同行的女子只是默默的摇了摇头，“没什么，我只是突然觉得有点熟悉。”\n\n    和那金发女子相比，这名女子的身材更加修长一些，最为奇特的是，她竟然有着一头银色长发，一直披散在身后，直至脚踝。\n\n    长发留起来是很麻烦的，一般很少有人会把头发留的这么长，可她那银色长发不但发丝柔顺，更有着一种宛如银色水晶般的质感。\n\n    她脸上带着一个黑色的口罩，遮盖住了绝大部分面庞，只有一双眼眸露在外面。可尽管如此，也还是看的蓝潇一家三口一呆。\n\n    那真的是一双无比美丽的眼睛，卷翘的长睫毛，紫色的眼眸澄澈而通透，尤其是当她的眼神之中带着些许迷惘之时，更有种让人忍不住会心生怜爱的感觉。虽然因为口罩而看不出年龄，但感觉也不过就是二十岁上下的样子。\n\n    “阿姨，我的武魂就是蓝银草呢。”抬着头，蓝轩宇看着那银发女子，大眼睛眨了眨，有些自豪的说道。\n\n    “嗯？”银发女子下意识的低下头，她此时才看到身前不远处的这一家，她的视线自然而然的就落在了那身材不高的孩童身上。\n\n    蓝轩宇穿着卡其色的裤子，深蓝色上衣，不是什么名牌，可这对于相貌绝佳的他来说，根本都不是什么问题。他实在是太好看了，尤其是当他那一双漂亮的大眼睛盯视着那银发女子的时候，大眼睛眨了眨，长长的眼睫毛扑闪、扑闪的。\n\n    “哇，好可爱的小帅哥哦。”金发女子有些惊奇的叫了一声，立刻蹲下身体，和蓝轩宇平视，“小朋友，你好可爱啊！你叫什么名字呢？”\n\n    “我叫蓝轩宇。”蓝轩宇并不怯场，尤其是还带着蓝银草带给他的自豪之中，悦耳的童音回答了金发女子的问题。\n\n    金发女子扭头看向那银发少女，“娜娜，这孩子长得真好看呢，我还从来没见过这么可爱的孩子。”\n\n    娜娜也看到了小轩宇，可就\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
