We have thousands of such\ncaches. Only a few of us know them all.” He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow- Shadowed glow across face and beard. “Hear that?”\nThey listened.\nThe dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.\nTo Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing through him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move.\n“It has been calculated with precision,” Stilgar whispered. “We know to within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis.”\nA hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: “Bi-lal kaifa.”\n“We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings,” Stilgar said, his voice growing stronger. “We will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.\n“Each year the polar ice retreats,” Stilgar said.\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” they chanted.\n“We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis—with melting lenses at the poles, with lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the maker and his spice.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa.”\n“And no man ever again shall want for water. It Shall be his for dipping from well or pond or lake or\ncanal. It shall run down through the qanats to feed our plants. It shall be there for any man to take. It Shall be his for holding out his hand.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa.”\nJessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively awed response. They're in league with the future, she thought. They have their mountain to climb. This is the scientist’s dream...and these simple people, these peasants, are filled with it.\nHer thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor’s planetary ecologist, the man who had gone native— and she wondered at him. This was a dream to capture men’s souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it. This was a dream for which men would die willingly. It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul’s place for him.\n“We leave now,” Stilgar said, “and wait for the first moon’s rising. When Jamis is safely on his way, we will go home.”\nWhispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along the water barrier and up the stairs.\nAnd Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him, that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth. He knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a fragment of prescient dream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place were being filled in now that he had not seen. He felt a new\nsense of wonder at the limits of his gift. It was as though he rode within the wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on a crest—and all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then hiding what they bore on their surface.\nThrough it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence and the slaughter. It was like a promontory above the surf.\nThe troop filed through the last door into the main cavern. The door was sealed. Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern openings, revealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert.\nJessica moved to the dry lip of the cavern’s edge, looked up at the stars. They were sharp and near. She felt the stirring of the troop around her, heard the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her, and Paul’s voice humming the pitch. There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like.\nChant’s voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: “Tell me about the waters of your birthworld, Paul-Muad’Dib.”\nAnd Paul: “Another time, Chani. | promise.”\nSuch sadness.\n“It’s a good baliset,” Chani said.\n“Very good,” Paul said. “Do you think Jamis’II mind my using it?”\nHe speaks of the dead in the present tense, Jessica thought. The implications disturbed her.\nA man’s voice intruded: “He liked music betimes, Jamis did.”\n“Then sing me one of your songs,” Chani pleaded.\nSuch feminine allure in that girl-child’s voice, Jessica thought. / must caution Paul about their women...and soon.\n“This was a song of a friend of mine,” Paul said. “l expect he’s dead now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong.”\nThe troop grew still, listening as Paul’s voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:\n“This clear time of seeing embers—\nA gold-bright sun’s lost in first dusk. What frenzied senses, desp’rate musk Are consort of rememb’ring.”\nJessica felt the verbal music in her breast—pagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.\n“Night’s pearl-censered requi-em... ‘Tis for us!\nWhat joys run, then—\nBright in your eyes—\nWhat flower-spangled amores\nPull at our hearts...\nWhat flower-spangled amores\nFill our desires.”\nAnd Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last note. Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? she asked herself. She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp on its reins. Why\ndid he choose that song? she wondered. The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?\nPaul sat silently in the darkness, a single stark thought dominating his awareness: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me. She is my enemy.\nThe concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nO n his seventeenth birthday, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen killed his one hundredth slave- gladiator in the family games. Visiting observers from the Imperial Court—a Count and Lady Fenring—were on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime for the event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden box above the triangular arena.\nIn honor of the na-Baron’s nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and subjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime. The old Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from labors, and effort had been spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of gaiety: banners flew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the walls along Court Way.\nBut off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps, the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the furtive scurrying of the people.\nIn the Baron’s blue-walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the Count and his lady saw the price being paid—guards everywhere and weapons with that special sheen that told a trained eye they were\nin regular use. There were checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep. The servants revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of their shoulders...in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.\n“The pressure’s on,” the Count hummed to his lady in their secret language. “The Baron Is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of the Duke Leto.”\n“Sometime | must recount for you the legend of the phoenix,” she said.\nThey were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family games. It was not a large hall— perhaps forty meters long and half that in width—but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper, and the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater space.\n“Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron,” the Count said.\nThe Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddling-glide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor-hung weight. His jowls bobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe. Rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into the robe.\nAt the Baron’s elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in close ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes. He wore a tight-fitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom. Soft-soled slippers covered his small feet.\nLady Fenring, noting the young man’s poise and the sure flow of muscles beneath the tunic, thought: Here’s one who won't let himself go to fat.\nThe Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd- Rautha’s arm in a possessive grip, said, “My nephew, the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.” And, turning his baby-fat face toward Feyd-Rautha, he said, “The Count and Lady Fenring of whom I've spoken.”\nFeyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the Lady Fenring. She was golden-haired and willowy, her perfection of figure clothed in a flowing gown of ecru—simple fitness of form without ornament. Gray-green eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene Gesserit serene repose about her that the young man found subtly disturbing.\n“Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m,” said the Count. He Studied Feyd-Rautha. “The, hm-m-m-m, precise young man, ah, my...Am-m-m-m...dear?” The Count glanced at the Baron. “My dear Baron, you say you've spoken of us to this precise young man? What did you say?”\n“I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you, Count Fenring,” the Baron said. And he thought: Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the manners of a rabbit—this is the most dangerous kind.\n“Of course!” said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.\nFeyd-Rautha found the man’s actions and words almost insulting. They stopped just short of something overt that would require notice. The young\nman focused his attention on the Count: a small man, weak-looking. The face was weaselish with overlarge dark eyes. There was gray at the temples. And his movements—he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way. It was difficult to follow.\n“Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you come upon such, mm-m-m, preciseness so rarely,” the Count said, addressing the Baron’s shoulder. “I...ah, congratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the light of the hm-m-m elder, one might say.”\n“You are too kind,” the Baron said. He bowed,", " rabbit—this is the most dangerous kind.\n“Of course!” said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.\nFeyd-Rautha found the man’s actions and words almost insulting.

In the light of the hm-m-m elder, one might say.”\n“You are too kind,” the Baron said. He bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted that his uncle’s eyes did not agree with the courtesy.\n“When you're mm-m-m ironic, that ah-h-h suggests you’re hm-mm-m thinking deep thoughts,” the Count said.\nThere he goes again, Feyd-Rautha thought. /t sounds like he’s being insulting, but there’s nothing you can call out for satisfaction.\nListening to the man gave Feyd-Rautha the feeling his head was being pushed through mush...um-m-m- ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m! Feyd-Rautha turned his attention back to the Lady Fenring.\n“We're ah-h-h taking up too much of this young man’s time,” she said. “I understand he’s to appear in the arena today.”\nBy the houris of the Imperial hareem, she’s a lovely one! Feyd-Rautha thought. He said: “I shall make a kill for you this day, my Lady. | shall make the dedication in the arena, with your permission.”\nShe returned his stare serenely, but her voice carried whiplash as she said: “You do not have my permission.”\n“Feyd!” the Baron said. And he thought: That imp! Does he want this deadly Count to call him out?\nBut the Count only smiled and said: “Hm-m-m-m- um-m-m.”\n“You really must be getting ready for the arena, Feyd,” the Baron said. “You must be rested and not take any foolish risks.”\nFeyd-Rautha bowed, his face dark with resentment. “I’m sure everything will be as you wish, Uncle.” He nodded to Count Fenring. “Sir.” To the lady: “My Lady.” And he turned, strode out of the hall, barely glancing at the knot of Families Minor near the double doors.\n“He’s so young,” the Baron sighed.\n“Um-m-m-m-ah indeed hmmm,” the Count said.\nAnd the Lady Fenring thought: Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother meant? Is that a bloodline we must preserve?\n“We've more than an hour before going to the arena,” the Baron said. “Perhaps we could have our little talk now, Count Fenring.” He tipped his gross head to the right. “There’s a considerable amount of progress to be discussed.”\nAnd the Baron thought: Let us see now how the Emperor’s errand boy gets across whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to speak it right out.\nThe Count spoke to his lady: “Um-m-m-m-ah-h-h- hm-m-m, you mm-m will ah-h-h excuse us, my dear?”\n“Each day, some time each hour, brings change,” She said. “Mmm-mm.” And she smiled sweetly at the Baron before turning away. Her long skirts swished and she walked with a straight-backed regal stride toward the double doors at the end of the hall.\nThe Baron noted how all conversation among the Houses Minor there stopped at her approach, how the eyes followed her. Bene Gesserit! the Baron thought. The universe would be better rid of them all!\n“There’s a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our left,” the Baron said. “We can talk there without fear of being overheard.” He led the way with his waddling gait into the sound- deadening field, feeling the noises of the keep become dull and distant.\nThe Count moved up beside the Baron, and they turned, facing the wall so their lips could not be read.\n“We're not satisfied with the way you ordered the Sardaukar off Arrakis,” the Count said.\nStraight talk! the Baron thought.\n“The Sardaukar could not stay longer without risking that others would find out how the Emperor helped me,” the Baron said.\n“But your nephew Rabban does not appear to be pressing strongly enough toward a solution of the Fremen problem.”\n“What does the Emperor wish?” the Baron asked. “There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left on Arrakis. The southern desert is uninhabitable. The northern desert is swept regularly by our patrols.”\n“Who says the southern desert is uninhabitable?”\n“Your own planetologist said it, my dear Count.”\n“But Doctor Kynes is dead.”\n“Ah, yes...unfortunate, that.”\n“We've word from an overflight across the southern reaches,” the Count said. “There’s evidence of plant life.”\n“Has the Guild then agreed to a watch from Space?”\n“You know better than that, Baron. The Emperor cannot legally post a watch on Arrakis.”\n“And / cannot afford it,” the Baron said. “Who made this overflight?”\n“A...smuggler.”\n“Someone has lied to you, Count,” the Baron said. “Smugglers cannot navigate the southern reaches any better than can Rabban’s men. Storms, sand- Static, and all that, you know. Navigation markers are knocked out faster than they can be installed.”\n“We'll discuss various types of static another time,” the Count said.\nAh-h-h-h, the Baron thought. “Have you found some mistake in my accounting then?” he demanded.\n“When you imagine mistakes there can be no self- defense,” the Count said.\nHe’s deliberately trying to arouse my anger, the Baron thought. He took two deep breaths to calm himself. He could smell his own sweat, and the harness of the suspensors beneath his robe felt suddenly itchy and galling.\n“The Emperor cannot be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the boy,” the Baron said. “They fled into the desert. There was a storm.”\n“Yes, there were so many convenient accidents,” the Count agreed.\n“I do not like your tone, Count,” the Baron said.\n“Anger is one thing, violence another,” the Count said. “Let me caution you: Should an unfortunate accident occur to me here the Great Houses all would learn what you did on Arrakis. They’ve long Suspected how you do business.”\n“The only recent business | can recall,” the Baron said, “was transportation of several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis.”\n“You think you could hold that over the Emperor’s head?”\n“I wouldn’t think of it!”\nThe Count smiled. “Sardaukar commanders could be found who'd confess they acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your Fremen scum.”\n“Many might doubt such a confession,” the Baron said, but the threat staggered him. Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined? he wondered.\n“The Emperor does wish to audit your books,” the Count said.\n“Anytime.”\n“You...ah...have no objections?”\n“None. My CHOAM Company directorship will bear the closest scrutiny.” And he thought: Let him bring a false accusation against me and have it exposed. | shall stand there, promethean, saying: “Behold me, | am wronged.” Then let him bring any other accusation against me, even a true one. The Great\nHouses will not believe a second attack from an accuser once proved wrong.\n“No doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny,” the Count muttered.\n“Why is the Emperor so interested in exterminating the Fremen?” the Baron asked.\n“You wish the subject to be changed, eh?” The Count shrugged. “It is the Sardaukar who wish it, not the Emperor. They needed practice in killing...and they hate to see a task left undone.”\nDoes he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by bloodthirsty killers? the Baron wondered.\n“A certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business,” the Baron said, “but a line has to be drawn somewhere. Someone must be left to work the spice.”\nThe Count emitted a short, barking laugh. “You think you can harness the Fremen?”\n“There never were enough of them for that,” the Baron said. “But the killing has made the rest of my population uneasy. It’s reaching the point where I’m considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem, my dear Fenring. And | must confess the Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration.”\n“Ah-h-h?”\n“You see, Count, | have the Emperor’s prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to inspire me.”\nThe Count stared at him with glittering intensity. “What possible connection is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?”\nThe Baron felt the alertness in Fenring’s eyes, said: “No connection yet.”\n“Yet?”\n“You must admit it'd be a way to develop a substantial work force on Arrakis—use the place as a prison planet.”\n“You anticipate an increase in prisoners?”\n“There has been unrest,” the Baron admitted. “I’ve had to squeeze rather severely, Fenring. After all, you know the price I paid that damnable Guild to transport our mutual force to Arrakis. That money has to come from somewhere.”\n“I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor’s permission, Baron.”\n“Of course not,” the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in Fenring’s voice.\n“Another matter,” the Count said. “We learn that Duke Leto’s Mentat, Thufir Hawat, is not dead but in your employ.”\n“I could not bring myself to waste him,” the Baron Said.\n“You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead.”\n“Only a white lie, my dear Count. | hadn’t the stomach for a long argument with the man.”\n“Was Hawat the real traitor?”\n“Oh, goodness, no! It was the false doctor.” The Baron wiped at perspiration on his neck. “You must understand, Fenring, | was without a Mentat. You know that. I’ve never been without a Mentat. It was most unsettling.”\n“How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?”\n“His Duke was dead.” The Baron forced a smile. “There’s nothing to fear from Hawat, my dear Count. The Mentat’s flesh has been impregnated with a latent poison. We administer an antidote in his meals. Without the antidote, the poison is triggered—he’d die in a few days.”\n“Withdraw the antidote,” the Count said.\n“But he’s useful!”\n“And he knows too many things no living man should know.”\n“You said the Emperor doesn’t fear exposure.”\n“Don’t play games with me, Baron!”\n“When I see such an order above the Imperial seal l'Il obey it,” the Baron said. “But l'Il not submit to your whim.”\n“You think it whim?”\n“What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. | rid him of the troublesome Duke.”\n“With the help of a few Sardaukar.”\n“Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising uniforms to hide his hand in this matter?”\n“He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly different emphasis.”\nThe Baron studied Fenring", " a latent poison. We administer an antidote in his meals. Without the antidote, the poison is triggered—he’d die in a few days.”\n“Withdraw the antidote,” the Count said.\n“But he’s useful!”\n“And he knows too many things no living man should know.”\n“You said the Emperor doesn’t fear exposure.”\n“Don’t play games with me, Baron!”\n“When I see such an order above the Imperial seal l'Il obey it,” the Baron said. “But l'Il not submit to your whim.”\n“You think it whim?”\n“What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. | rid him of the troublesome Duke.”\n“With the help of a few Sardaukar.”\n“Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising uniforms to hide his hand in this matter?”\n“He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly different emphasis.”\nThe Baron studied Fenring, noting the stiffness of jaw muscles, the careful control. “Ah-h-h, now,” the Baron said. “I hope the Emperor doesn’t believe he can move against me in total secrecy.”\n“He hopes it won’t become necessary.”\n“The Emperor cannot believe | threaten him!” The Baron permitted anger and grief to edge his voice,\nthinking: Let him wrong me in that! | could place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I'd been wronged.\nThe Count’s voice went dry and remote as he said: “The Emperor believes what his senses tell him.”\n“Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council?” And the Baron held his breath with the hope of it.\n“The Emperor need dare nothing.”\nThe Baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression. /t could happen in my lifetime! he thought. Emperor! Let him wrong me! Then—the bribes and coercion, the rallying of the Great Houses: they’d flock to my banner like peasants running for shelter. The thing they fear above all else is the Emperor’s Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time.\n“It’s the Emperor’s sincere hope he’ll never have to charge you with treason,” the Count said.\nThe Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only the expression of hurt, but he managed. “I’ve been a most loyal subject. These words hurt me beyond my capacity to express.”\n“Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m,” said the Count.\nThe Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding. Presently he said, “It’s time to go to the arena.”\n“Indeed,” said the Count.\nThey moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward the clumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall. A bell began a slow tolling somewhere in the keep—twenty-minute warning for the arena gathering.\n“The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them,” the Count said, nodding toward the people they approached.\nDouble meaning...double meaning, the Baron thought.\nHe looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hall—the mounted bull’s head and the oil painting of the Old Duke Atreides, the late Duke Leto’s father. They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered what thoughts these talismans had inspired in the Duke Leto as they hung in the halls of Caladan and then on Arrakis—the bravura father and the head of the bull that had killed him.\n“Mankind has ah only one mm-m-m science,” the Count said as they picked up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room—a narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.\n“And what science is that?” the Baron asked.\n“It’s the um-m-m-ah-h science of ah-h-h discontent,” the Count said.\nThe Houses Minor behind them, sheep-faced and responsive, laughed with just the right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of discord as it collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open the outer doors, revealing the line of ground cars, their guidon pennants whipping in a breeze.\nThe Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, “I hope you'll not be discontented with\nthe performance of my nephew today, Count Fenring.”\n“| ah-h-h am filled um-m-m only with a hm-m-m sense of anticipation, yes,” the Count said. “Always in the ah-h-h proces verbal, one um-m-m ah-h-h must consider the ah-h-h office of origin.”\nThe Baron did his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first step down from the exit. Proces verbal! That was a report of a crime against the Imperium!\nBut the Count chuckled to make it seem a joke, and patted the Baron’s arm.\nAll the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored cushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him, wondering why the Emperor’s errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular kind of joke in front of the Houses Minor. It was obvious that Fenring seldom did anything he felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or held himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.\nThey were seated in the golden box above the triangular arena—horns blaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and waving pennants—when the answer came to the Baron.\n“My dear Baron,” the Count said, leaning close to his ear, “you know, don’t you, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir?”\nThe Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence produced by his own shock. He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the Count’s lady\ncome through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box.\n“That’s really why I’m here today,” the Count said. “The Emperor wishes me to report on whether you’ve chosen a worthy successor. There’s nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?”\n“The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!” the Baron grated.\n“We shall see,” Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady. She sat down, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath them where Feyd-Rautha was emerging in giles and tights—the black glove and the long knife in his right hand, the white glove and the short knife in his left hand.\n“White for poison, black for purity,” the Lady Fenring said. “A curious custom, isn’t it, my love?”\n“Um-m-m-m,” the Count said.\nThe greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd-Rautha paused to accept it, looking up and scanning the faces—seeing his cousines and cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-freyn relations. They were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and banners.\nIt came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just as avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was not a doubt of the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the form of danger without its substance—yet....\nFeyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of the arena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand (white, the sign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long blade in the black-gloved hand—the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn this day into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade.\nThe adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to sense the skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded.\nThis moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd- Rautha dragged it out with the sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and distractors, checking their equipment with a measuring stare— gyves in place with their prickles sharp and glistening, the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers.\nFeyd-Rautha signaled the musicians.\nThe slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle’s box. He caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown.\nThe music stopped.\nInto the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and shouted. “I dedicate this truth to....” And he paused, knowing his uncle would think: The young fool’s going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and cause a ruckus!\n“to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!” Feyd-Rautha shouted.\nAnd he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.\nThe music resumed at the quick-march, and Feyd- Rautha led his men scampering back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the proper identification band. Feyd-Rautha prided himself that he never used the pru-door and seldom needed distractors. But it was good to know they were available this day—special plans sometimes involved special dangers.\nAgain, silence settled over the arena.\nFeyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the gladiator would emerge.\nThe special gladiator.\nThe plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct, Feyd-Rautha thought. The slave would not be drugged—that was the danger. Instead, a key word had been drummed into the man’s unconscious to immobilize his muscles at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital word in his mind, mouthing it without sound: “Scum!” To the audience, it would appear that an undrugged slave had been Slipped into the arena to kill the na-Baron. And all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the Sslavemaster.\nA low humming arose from the red door’s servo- motors as they were armed for opening.\nFeyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was the critical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye much it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug to come out kill-ready in fighting stance—but you had to\nwatch how they hefted the knife, which way they turned in defense, whether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands. The way a slave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to counter and feint.\nThe red door slammed open.\nOut charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes. His skin was carrot- colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but Feyd-Rautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards and the red belt of a semishield —the belt’s arrow pointing left to indicate the slave’s left side was shielded. He held his knife sword- fashion, cocked slightly outward in the stance of a trained fighter. Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his shielded side toward Feyd-Rautha and the group at the pru-door.\n“I like not the look of this one,” said one of Feyd- Rautha’s baromen. “Are you sure he’s drugged, m’Lord?”\n“He has the color,” Feyd-Rautha said.\n“Yet he stands like a fighter,” said another helper.\nFeyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, Studied this slave.\n“What has he done to his arm?” asked one of the distractors.\nFeyd-Rautha’s attention went to a"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_5121304d7d0f6a215273645f63318160d97fe00005456b9ff96479d8b21158cd_v2"}
