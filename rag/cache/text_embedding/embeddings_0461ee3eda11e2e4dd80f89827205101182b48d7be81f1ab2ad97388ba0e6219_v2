dangerous.\nEven after the others had gone, Odrade was left with the aftershock of Bellonda’s unspoken fears.\nAnd my fears.\nShe arose and went to the wide window that looked across lower rooftops to part of the ring of orchards and\npastures around Central. Late spring and already fruit beginning to form out there. Rebirth. A new Teg was born today! No feeling of elation accompanied the thought. Usually she found the view restorative but not this morning.\nWhat are my real strengths? What are my facts?\nThe resources at a Mother Superior’s command were formidable: profound loyalty in those who served her, a military arm under a Teg-trained Bashar (far away now with a large portion of their troops guarding the school planet, Lampadas), artisans and technicians, spies and agents throughout the Old Empire, countless workers who looked to the Sisterhood to protect them from Honored Matres, and all the Reverend Mothers with Other Memories reaching into the dawn of life.\nOdrade knew without false pride that she represented the peak of what was strongest in a Reverend Mother. If her personal memories did not provide needed information, she had others around her to fill the gaps. Machine-stored data as well, although she admitted to a native distrust of it.\nOdrade found herself tempted to go digging in those other lives she carried as secondary memory—these subterranean layers of awareness. Perhaps she could find brilliant solutions to their predicament in experiences of Others. Dangerous! You could lose yourself for hours, fascinated by the multiplicity of human variations. Better to leave Other Memories balanced in there, ready on demand or intruding out of necessity. Consciousness, that was the fulcrum and her grip on identity.\nDuncan Idaho’s odd Mentat metaphor helped.\nSelf-awareness: facing mirrors that pass through the universe, gathering new images on the way—endlessly reflexive. The infinite seen as finite, the analogue of consciousness carrying the sensed bits of infinity.\nShe had never heard words come closer to her wordless awareness. “Specialized complexity,” Idaho called it. “We gather, assemble, and reflect our systems of order.”\nIndeed, it was the Bene Gesserit view that humans were life designed by evolution to create order.\nAnd how does that help us against these disorderly women who hunt us? What branch of evolution are they? Is evolution just another name for God?\nHer Sisters would sneer at such “bootless speculation.”\nStill, there might be answers in Other Memory.\nAhhhh, how seductive!\nHow desperately she wanted to project her beleaguered self into past identities and feel what it had been to live then. The immediate peril of this enticement chilled her. She felt Other Memory crowding the edges of awareness. “/t was like this!” “No! It was more like this!” How greedy they were. You had to pick and choose, discreetly animating the past. And was that not the purpose of consciousness, the very essence of being alive?\nSelect from the past and match it against the present: Learn consequences.\nThat was the Bene Gesserit view of history, ancient Santayana’s words resonating in their lives: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\nThe buildings of Central itself, this most powerful of all Bene Gesserit establishments, reflected that attitude wherever Odrade turned. Usiform, that was the commanding concept. Little about any Bene Gesserit working center was allowed to become non-functional, preserved out of nostalgia. The Sisterhood had no need for archeologists. Reverend Mothers embodied history.\nSlowly (much slower than usual) the view out her high window produced its calming effect. What her eyes reported, that was Bene Gesserit order.\nBut Honored Matres could end that order in the next instant. The Sisterhood’s situation was far worse than what they had suffered under the Tyrant. Many of the decisions she was forced to make now were odious. Her workroom was less agreeable because of actions taken here.\nWrite off our Bene Gesserit Keep on Palma?\nThat suggestion was in Bellonda’s morning report waiting on the worktable. Odrade fixed an affirmative notation to it. “Yes.”\nWrite it off because Honored Matre attack is imminent and we cannot defend them or evacuate them.\nEleven hundred Reverend Mothers and the Fates alone knew how many acolytes, postulants, and others dead or worse because of that one word. Not to mention all of the “Ordinary lives” existing in the Bene Gesserit shadow.\nThe strain of such decisions produced a new kind of weariness in Odrade. Was it a weariness of the soul? Did such a thing as a soul exist? She felt deep fatigue where consciousness could not probe. Weary, weary, weary.\nEven Bellonda showed the strain and Bell feasted on violence. Tamalane alone appeared above it but that did not fool Odrade. Tam had entered the age of superior observation that lay ahead of all Sisters if they survived into it. Nothing mattered then except observations and judgments. Most of this was never uttered except in fleeting expressions on wrinkled features. Tamalane spoke few words these days, her comments so sparse as to be almost ludicrous:\n“Buy more no-ships.”\n“Brief Sheeana.”\n“Review Idaho records.”\n“Ask Murbella.”\nSometimes, only grunts issued from her, as though words might betray her.\nAnd always the hunters roamed out there, sweeping space for any clue to the location of Chapterhouse.\nIn her most private thoughts, Odrade saw the no-ships of Honored Matres as corsairs on those infinite seas between the stars. They flew no black flags with skull and crossbones, but that flag was there nonetheless. Nothing whatsoever romantic about them. Kill and pillage! Amass\nyour wealth in the blood of others. Drain that energy and build your killer no-ships on ways lubricated with blood.\nAnd they did not see they would drown in red lubricant if they kept on this course.\nThere must be furious people out there in that human Scattering where Honored Matres originated, people who live out their lives with a single fixed idea: Get them!\nIt was a dangerous universe where such ideas were allowed to float around freely. Good civilizations took care that such ideas did not gain energy, did not even get a chance for birth. When they did occur, by chance or accident, they were to be diverted quickly because they tended to gather mass.\nOdrade was astonished that the Honored Matres did not see this or, seeing it, ignored it.\n“Full-blown hysterics,” Tamalane called them.\n“Xenophobia,” Bellonda disagreed, always correcting, as though control of Archives gave her a better hold on reality.\nBoth were right, Odrade thought. The Honored Matres behaved hysterically. All outsiders were the enemy. The only people they appeared to trust were the men they sexually enslaved, and those only to a limited degree. Constantly testing, according to Murbella (our only captive Honored Matre), to see if their hold was firm.\n“Sometimes out of mere pique they may eliminate someone just as an example to others.” Murbella’s words and they forced the question: Are they making an example of us? “See! This is what happens to those who dare oppose us!”\nMurbella had said, “You’ve aroused them. Once aroused, they will not desist until they have destroyed you.”\nGet the outsiders!\nSingularly direct. A weakness in them if we play it right, Odrade thought.\nXenophobia carried to a ridiculous extreme?\nQuite possibly.\nOdrade pounded a fist on her worktable, aware that the action would be seen and recorded by Sisters who kept constant watch on Mother Superior’s behavior. She spoke aloud then for the omnipresent comeyes and watchdog Sisters behind them.\n“We will not sit and wait in defensive enclaves! We've become as fat as Bellonda (and let her fret over that!) thinking we’ve created an untouchable society and enduring structures.”\nOdrade swept her gaze around the familiar room.\n“This place is one of our weaknesses!”\nShe took her seat behind the worktable thinking (of all things!) about architecture and community planning. Well, that was a Mother Superior’s right!\nSisterhood communities seldom grew at random. Even when they took over existing structures (as they had with the old Harkonnen Keep on Gammu) they did so with rebuilding plans. They wanted pneumotubes to shunt small packages and messages. Lightlines and hardray projectors to transmit encrypted words. They considered themselves masters at safeguarding communications. Acolyte and Reverend Mother couriers (committed to self-destruction rather than betray their superiors) carried the more important messages.\nShe could visualize it out there beyond her window and beyond this planet—her web, superbly organized and manned, each Bene Gesserit an extension of the others. Where Sisterhood survival was concerned, there was an untouchable core of loyalty. Backsliders there might be, some spectacular (as the Lady Jessica, grandmother of the Tyrant), but they slid only so far. Most upsets were temporary.\nAnd all of that was a Bene Gesserit pattern. A weakness.\nOdrade admitted a deep agreement with Bellonda’s fears. But l'Il be damned if | allow such things to depress all joy of\nliving! That would be giving in to the very thing those rampaging Honored Matres wanted.\n“It’s our strengths the hunters want,” Odrade said, looking up at the ceiling comeyes. Like ancient savages eating the hearts of enemies. Well... we will give them something to eat all right! And they will not know until too late that they cannot digest it!\nExcept for preliminary teachings tailored to acolytes and postulants, the Sisterhood did not go in much for admonitory sayings, but Odrade had her own private watchwords: “Someone has to do the plowing.” She smiled to herself as she bent to her work much refreshed. This room, this Sisterhood, these were her garden and there were weeds to be removed, seeds to plant. And fertilizer. Mustn't forget the fertilizer.\nWhen I set out to lead humanity along my Golden Path | promised a lesson their bones would remember. | know a profound pattern humans deny with words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, conditions they call peace. Even as they speak, they create seeds of turmoil and violence.\n—LETO II, THE GOD EMPEROR\nSs? she calls me Spider Queen!\nGreat Honored Matre leaned back in a heavy chair set high on a dais. Her withered breast shook with silent chuckles. She knows what will happen when I get her in my web! Suck her dry, that’s what l'Il do.\nA small woman with unremarkable features and muscles that twitched nervously, she looked down on the skylighted yellow-tile floor of her audience room. A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother sprawled there in shigawire bindings. The captive made no attempt to struggle. Shigawire was excellent for this purpose. Cut her arms off, it would!\nThe chamber where she sat suited Great Honored Matre as much for its dimensions as for the fact that it had been taken from others. Three hundred meters square, it had been designed for convocations of Guild Navigators here on Junction, each Navigator in a monstrous tank. The captive on that yellow floor was a mote in immensity.\nThis weakling took too much joy in revealing what her so- called Superior named me!\nBut it still was a lovely morning, Great Honored Matre thought.

Three hundred meters square, it had been designed for convocations of Guild Navigators here on Junction, each Navigator in a monstrous tank. The captive on that yellow floor was a mote in immensity.\nThis weakling took too much joy in revealing what her so- called Superior named me!\nBut it still was a lovely morning, Great Honored Matre thought. Except that no tortures or mental probes worked on these witches. How could you torture someone who might choose to die at any moment? And did! They had ways of suppressing pain, too. Very wily, these primitives.\nShe’s loaded with shere, too! A body infused with that damnable drug deteriorated beyond the reach of probes before it could be examined adequately.\nGreat Honored Matre signaled an aide. That one nudged the sprawled Reverend Mother with a foot and, at a further signal, eased the shigawire bindings to allow minimal movement.\n“What is your name, child?” Great Honored Matre asked. Her voice rasped hoarsely with age and false bonhomie.\n“lam called Sabanda.” Clear young voice, still untouched by the pain of probings.\n“Would you like to watch us capture a weak male and enslave him?” Great Honored Matre asked.\nSabanda knew the proper response to this. They had been warned. “I will die first.” She said it calmly, staring up at that ancient face the color of a dried root left too long in the sun. Those odd orange flecks in the crone’s eyes. A sign of anger, Proctors had told her.\nA loosely hung red-gold robe with black dragon figures down its open face and red leotards beneath it only emphasized the scrawny figure they covered.\nGreat Honored Matre did not change expression even with a recurrent thought about these witches: Damn them! “What was your task on that dirty little planet where we took you?”\n“A teacher of the young.”\n“I’m afraid we didn’t leave any of your young alive.” Now why does she smile? To offend me! That’s why!\n“Did you teach your young ones to worship the witch, Sheeana?” Great Honored Matre asked.\n“Why should | teach them to worship a Sister? Sheeana would not like that.”\n“Would not... Are you saying she has come back to life and you know her?”\n“Is it only the living we know?”\nHow clear and fearless the voice of this young witch. They had remarkable self-control, but even that could not save them. Odd, though, how this cult of Sheeana persisted. It would have to be rooted out, of course, destroyed the way the witches themselves were being destroyed.\nGreat Honored Matre lifted the little finger of her right hand. A waiting aide approached the captive with an injection. Perhaps this new drug would free a witch’s tongue, perhaps not. No matter.\nSabanda grimaced when the injector touched her neck. In seconds she was dead. Servants carried the body away. It would be fed to captive Futars. Not that Futars were much use. Wouldn’t breed in captivity, wouldn’t obey the most ordinary commands. Sullen, waiting.\n“Where Handlers?” one might ask. Or other useless words would spill from their humanoid mouths. Still, Futars provided some pleasures. Captivity also demonstrated they were vulnerable. Just as these primitive witches were. We’// find the witches’ hiding place. It’s only a matter of time.\nThe person who takes the banal and ordinary and illuminates it in a new way can terrify. We do not want our ideas changed. We feel threatened by such demands. “I already know the important things!” we say. Then Changer comes and throws our old ideas away.\n—THE ZENSUFI MASTER\nM iles Teg enjoyed playing in the orchards around Central. Odrade had first taken him here when he could just toddle. One of his earliest memories: hardly more than two years old and already aware he was a ghola, though he did not understand the word’s full meaning.\n“You are a special child,” Odrade said. “We made you from cells taken from a very old man.”\nAlthough he was a precocious child and her words had a vaguely disturbing sound, he was more interested then in running through tall summer grass beneath the trees.\nLater, he added other orchard days to that first one, accumulating as well impressions about Odrade and the others who taught him. He recognized quite early that Odrade enjoyed the excursions as much as he did.\nOne afternoon in his fourth year, he told her: “Spring is my favorite time.”\n“Mine, too.”\nWhen he was seven and already showing the mental brilliance coupled to holographic memory that had caused the Sisterhood to place such heavy responsibilities on his previous incarnation, he suddenly saw the orchards as a place touching something deep inside him.\nThis was his first real awareness that he carried memories he could not recall. Deeply disturbed, he turned to Odrade,\nwho stood outlined in light against the afternoon sun, and said: “There are things | can’t remember!”\n“One day you will remember,” she said.\nHe could not see her face against the bright light and her words came from a great shadow place, as much within him as from Odrade.\nThat year he began studying the life of the Bashar Miles Teg, whose cells had started his new life. Odrade had explained some of this to him, holding up her fingernails. “l took tiny scrapings from his neck—cells of his skin and they held all we needed to bring you to life.”\nThere was something intense about the orchards that year, fruit larger and heavier, bees almost frenetic.\n“It’s because of the desert growing larger down there in the south,” Odrade said. She held his hand as they walked through a dew-fresh morning beneath burgeoning apple trees.\nTeg stared southward through the trees, momentarily mesmerized by leaf-dappled sunlight. He had studied about the desert, and he thought he could feel the weight of it on this place.\n“Trees can sense their end approaching,” Odrade said. “Life breeds more intensely when threatened.”\n“The air is very dry,” he said. “That must be the desert.”\n“Notice how some of the leaves have gone brown and curled at the edges? We've had to irrigate heavily this year.”\nHe liked it that she seldom talked down to him. It was mostly one person to another. He saw curled brown on leaves. The desert did that.\nDeep in the orchard, they listened quietly for a time to birds and insects. Bees working the clover of a nearby pasture came to investigate but he was pheromone-marked, as were all who walked freely on Chapterhouse. They buzzed past him, sensed identifiers and went away about their business with blossoms.\nApples. Odrade pointed westward. Peaches. His attention went where she directed. And yes, there were the cherries east of them beyond the pasture. He saw resin ribbing on the limbs.\nSeeds and young shoots had been brought here on the Original no-ships some fifteen hundred years ago, she said, and had been planted with loving care.\nTeg visualized hands grubbing in dirt, gently patting earth around young shoots, careful irrigation, the fencing to confine the cattle to wild pastures around the first Chapterhouse plantations and buildings.\nBy this time he already had begun learning about the giant sandworm the Sisterhood had spirited from Rakis. Death of that worm had produced creatures called sandtrout. Sandtrout were why the desert grew. Some of this history touched accounts of his previous incarnation—a man they called “The Bashar.” A great soldier who had died when terrible women called Honored Matres destroyed Rakis.\nTeg found such studies both fascinating and troubling. He sensed gaps in himself, places where memories ought to be. The gaps called out to him in dreams. And sometimes when he fell into reverie, faces appeared before him. He could almost hear words. Then there were times he knew the names of things before anyone told him. Especially names of weapons.\nMomentous things grew in his awareness. This entire planet would become desert, a change started because Honored Matres wanted to kill these Bene Gesserit who raised him.\nReverend Mothers who controlled his life often awed him —black-robed, austere, those blue-in-blue eyes with absolutely no white. The spice did that, they said.\nOnly Odrade showed him anything he took for real affection and Odrade was someone very important. Everyone called her Mother Superior and that was what she\ntold him to call her except when they were alone in the orchards. Then he could call her Mother.\nOn a morning walk near harvest time in his ninth year, just over the third rise in the apple orchards north of Central, they came on a shallow depression free of trees and lush with many different plants. Odrade put a hand on his shoulder and held him where they could admire black stepping-stones in a meander track through massed greenery and tiny flowers. She was in an odd mood. He heard it in her voice.\n“Ownership is an interesting question,” she said. “Do we own this planet or does it own us?”\n“I like the smells here,” he said.\nShe released him and urged him gently ahead of her. “We planted for the nose here, Miles. Aromatic herbs. Study them carefully and look them up when you get back to the library. Oh, do step on them!” when he started to avoid a plant runner in his path.\nHe placed his right foot firmly on green tendrils and inhaled pungent odors.\n“They were made to be walked on and give up their savor,” Odrade said. “Proctors have been teaching you how to deal with nostalgia. Have they told you nostalgia often is driven by the sense of smell?”\n“Yes, Mother.” Turning to look back at where he had stepped, he said: “That’s rosemary.”\n“How do you know?” Very intense.\nHe shrugged. “I just know.”\n“That may be an original memory.” She sounded pleased.\nAs they continued their walk in the aromatic hollow, Odrade’s voice once more became pensive. “Each planet has its own character where we draw patterns of Old Earth. Sometimes, it’s only a faint sketch, but here we have succeeded.”\nShe knelt and pulled a twig from an acid-green plant. Crushing it in her fingers, she held it to his nose. “Sage.”\nShe was right but he could not say how he knew.\n“I’ve smelled that in food. Is that like melange?”\n“It improves flavor but won’t change consciousness.” She stood and looked down at him from her full height. “Mark this place well, Miles. Our ancestral worlds are gone, but here we have recaptured part of our origins.”\nHe sensed she was teaching him something important. He asked Odrade: “Why did you wonder if this planet owned us?”\n“My Sisterhood believes we are stewards of the land. Do you know about stewards?”\n“Like Roitiro, my friend Yorgi’s father. Yorgi says his oldest sister will be steward of their plantation someday.”\n“Correct. We have a longer residence on some planets than any other people we know of but we are only stewards.”\n“If you don’t own Chapterhouse, who does?”\n“Perhaps nobody. My question", " it to his nose. “Sage.”\nShe was right but he could not say how he knew.\n“I’ve smelled that in food. Is that like melange?”\n“It improves flavor but won’t change consciousness.” She stood and looked down at him from her full height. “Mark this place well, Miles. Our ancestral worlds are gone, but here we have recaptured part of our origins.”\nHe sensed she was teaching him something important. He asked Odrade: “Why did you wonder if this planet owned us?”\n“My Sisterhood believes we are stewards of the land. Do you know about stewards?”\n“Like Roitiro, my friend Yorgi’s father. Yorgi says his oldest sister will be steward of their plantation someday.”\n“Correct. We have a longer residence on some planets than any other people we know of but we are only stewards.”\n“If you don’t own Chapterhouse, who does?”\n“Perhaps nobody. My question is: How have we marked each other, my Sisterhood, and this planet?”\nHe looked up at her face then down at his hands. Was Chapterhouse marking him right now?\n“Most of the marks are deep inside us.” She took his hand. “Come along.” They left the aromatic dell and climbed up into Roitiro’s domain, Odrade speaking as they went.\n“The Sisterhood seldom creates botanical gardens,” she said. “Gardens must support far more than eyes and nose.”\n“Food?”\n“Yes, supportive first of our lives. Gardens produce food. That dell back there is harvested for our kitchens.”\nHe felt her words flow into him, lodging there among the gaps. He sensed planning for centuries ahead: trees to replace building beams, to hold watersheds, plants to keep lake and river banks from crumbling, to hold topsoil safe from rain and wind, to maintain seashores and even in the waters to make places for fish to breed. The Bene Gesserit\nalso thought of trees for shade and shelter, or to cast interesting shadows on lawns.\n“Trees and other plants for all of our symbiotic relationships,” she said.\n“Symbiotic?” It was a new word.\nShe explained with something she knew he already had encountered—going out with others to harvest mushrooms.\n“Fungi won’t grow except in the company of friendly roots. Each has a symbiotic relationship with a special plant. Each growing thing takes something it needs from the other.”\nShe went on at length and, bored with learning, he kicked a clump of grass, then saw how she stared at him in that disturbing way. He had done something offensive. Why was it right to step on one growing thing and not on another?\n“Miles! Grass keeps the wind from carrying topsoil into difficult places such as the bottoms of rivers.”\nHe knew that tone. Reprimanding. He stared down at the grass he had offended.\n“These grasses feed our cattle. Some have seeds we eat in bread and other foods. Some cane grasses are windbreaks.”\nHe knew that! Trying to divert her, he said: “Wind- brakes?” spelling it.\nShe did not smile and he knew he had been wrong to think he could fool her. Resigned to it, he listened as she went on with the lesson.\nWhen the desert came, she told him, grapes, their taproots down several hundred meters, probably would be the last to go. Orchards would die first.\n“Why do they have to die?”\n“To make room for more important life.”\n“Sandworms and melange.”\nHe saw he had pleased her by knowing the relationship between sandworms and the spice the Bene Gesserit needed for their existence. He was not sure how that need\nworked but he imagined a circle: Sandworms to sandtrout to melange and back again. And the Bene Gesserit took what they needed from the circle.\nHe was still tired of all this teaching, and asked: “If all these things are going to die anyway, why do I have to go back to the library and learn their names?”\n“Because you’re human and humans have this deep desire to classify, to apply labels to everything.”\n“Why do we have to name things like that?”\n“Because that way we lay claim to what we name. We assume an ownership that can be misleading and dangerous.”\nSo she was back on ownership.\n“My street, my lake, my planet,” she said. “My label forever. A label you give to a place or thing may not even last out your lifetime except as a polite sop granted by conquerors ... or as a sound to remember in fear.”\n“Dune,” he said.\n“You are quick!”\n“Honored Matres burned Dune.”\n“They'll do the same to us if they find us.”\n“Not if I’m your Bashar!” The words were out of him without thought but, once spoken, he felt they might have some truth. Library accounts said the Bashar had made enemies tremble just by appearing on a battlefield.\nAs though she knew what he was thinking, Odrade said: “The Bashar Teg was just as famous for creating situations where no battle was necessary.”\n“But he fought your enemies.”\n“Never forget Dune, Miles. He died there.”\n“I know.”\n“Do the Proctors have you studying Caladan yet?”\n“Yes. It’s called Dan in my histories.”\n“Labels, Miles. Names are interesting reminders but most people don’t make other connections. Boring history, eh?\nNames—convenient pointers, useful mostly with your own kind?”\n“Are you my kind?” It was a question that plagued him but not in those words until this instant.\n“We are Atreides, you and I. Remember that when you return to your study of Caladan.”\nWhen they went back through the orchards and across a pasture to the vantage knoll with its limb-framed view of Central, Teg saw the administrative complex and its barrier plantations with new sensitivity. He held this close as they went down the fenced lane to the arch into First Street.\n“A living jewel,” Odrade called Central.\nAs they passed under it, he looked up at the street name burned into the entrance arch. Galach in an elegant script with flowing lines, Bene Gesserit decorative. All streets and buildings were labeled in that same cursive.\nLooking around him at Central, the dancing fountain in the square ahead of them, the elegant details, he sensed a depth of human experience. The Bene Gesserit had made this place supportive in ways he did not quite fathom. Things picked up in studies and orchard excursions, simple things and complex, came to new focus. It was a latent Mentat reponse but he did not know this, only sensing that his unfailing memory had shifted some relationships and reorganized them. He stopped suddenly and looked back the way they had come—the orchard out there framed in the arch of the covered street. It was all related. Central’s effluent produced methane and fertilizer. (He had toured the plant with a Proctor.) Methane ran pumps and powered some of the refrigeration.\n“What are you looking at, Miles?”\nHe did not know how to answer. But he remembered an autumn afternoon when Odrade had taken him over Central in a ‘thopter to tell him about these relationships and give him “the overview.” Only words then but now the words had meaning.\n“AS near to a closed ecological circle as we can create,” Odrade had said in the ‘thopter. “Weather Control’s orbiters monitor it and order the flow lines.”\n“Why are you standing there looking at the orchard, Miles?” Her voice was full of imperatives against which he had no defenses.\n“In the ornithopter, you said it was beautiful but dangerous.”\nThey had taken only one ‘thopter trip together. She caught the reference immediately. “The ecological circle.”\nHe turned and looked up at her, waiting.\n“Enclosed,” she said. “How tempting it is to raise high walls and keep out change. Rot here in our own self-satisfied comfort.”\nHer words filled him with disquiet. He felt he had heard them before .. . some other place with a different woman holding his hand.\n“Enclosures of any kind are a fertile breeding ground for hatred of outsiders,” she said. “That produces a bitter harvest.”\nNot exactly the same words but the same lesson.\nHe walked slowly beside Odrade, his hand sweaty in hers.\n“Why are you so silent, Miles?”\n“You're farmers,” he said. “That’s really what you Bene Gesserit do.”\nShe saw immediately what had happened, Mentat training coming out in him without his knowing. Best not explore that yet. “We are concerned about everything that grows, Miles. It was perceptive of you to see this.”\nAs they parted, she to return to her tower, he to his quarters in the school section, Odrade said: “I will tell your Proctors to place more emphasis on subtle uses of power.”\nHe misunderstood. “I’m already training with lasguns. They say I’m very good.”\n“So I’ve heard. But there are weapons you cannot hold in your hands. You can only hold them in your mind.”\nRules build up fortifications behind which small minds create satrapies. A perilous state of affairs in the best of times, disastrous during crises.\n—BENE GESSERIT CODA\ntygian blackness in Great Honored Matre’s sleeping\nchamber. Logno, a Grand Dame and senior aide to the High One, entered from the unlighted hallway as she had been summoned to do and, seeing darkness, shuddered. These consultations with no illumination terrified her and she knew Great Honored Matre took pleasure from that. It could not be the only reason for darkness, though. Was Great Honored Matre fearful of attack? Several High Ones had been deposed in bed. No... not just that, although it might bear on the choice of setting.\nGrunts and moans in the darkness.\nSome Honored Matres snickered and said Great Honored Matre dared bed a Futar. Logno thought it possible. This Great Honored Matre dared many things. Had she not salvaged some of The Weapon from the disaster of the Scattering? Futars, though? The Sisters knew Futars could not be bonded by sex. At least not by sex with humans. That might be the way the Enemies of Many Faces did it, though. Who knew?\nThere was a furry smell in the bedchamber. Logno closed the door behind her and waited. Great Honored Matre did not like to be interrupted in whatever she did there within Shielding blackness. But she permits me to call her Dama.\nAnother moan, then: “Sit on the floor, Logno. Yes, there by the door.”\nDoes she really see me or only guess?\nLogno did not have the courage to test it. Poison. l'II get her that way someday. She’s cautious but she can be distracted. Although her Sisters might sneer at it, poison was an accepted tool of succession... provided the successor possessed further ways to maintain ascendancy.\n“Logno, those Ixians you spoke with today. What do they say of The Weapon?”\n“They do not understand its function, Dama. | did not tell them what it was.”\n“Of course not.”\n“Will you suggest again that Weapon and Charge be united?”\n“Are you sneering at me, Logno?”\n“Dama! | would never do such a thing.”\n“I hope not.”\nSilence. Logno understood that they both considered the same problem. Only three hundred units of The Weapon survived the disaster. Each could be used only once, provided the Council (which held the Charge) agreed to arm them. Great Honored Matre, controlling The Weapon itself, had only half of that awful power.
