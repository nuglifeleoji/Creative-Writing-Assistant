While they frequently collaborate with renegade **Fremen** factions, their relationship with the indigenous people is complex, sometimes leading to clashes over control of spice operations.  \n\nThe Smugglers' activities are a direct challenge to Imperial authority, as they bypass legal trade channels and evade taxation. Despite their illicit nature, they hold significant influence on Arrakis, prompting political maneuvering from powerful factions. Notably, **House Atreides** has considered negotiating with them to secure a tithe, indicating their strategic importance in the planet's economy.  \n\nThough some descriptions suggest cooperation with the Fremen while others highlight conflict, the Smugglers' interactions with them likely vary by faction and circumstance.
