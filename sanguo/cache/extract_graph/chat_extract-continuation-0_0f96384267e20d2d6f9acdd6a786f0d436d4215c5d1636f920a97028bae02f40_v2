大怒，挺枪纵马，直取陈泰。泰挥刀而迎。战不三合，泰败走，维挥兵掩杀。雍州兵退回，占住山头。维收兵就牛头山下寨。维每日令兵搦战，不分胜负。夏侯霸谓姜维曰：“此处不是久停之所。连日交战，不分胜负，乃诱兵之计耳，必有异谋。不如暂退，再作良图。”正言间，忽报郭淮引一军取洮水，断了粮道。维大惊，急令夏侯霸先退，维自断后。陈泰分兵五路赶来。维独拒五路总口，战住魏兵。泰勒兵上山，矢石如雨。维急退到洮水之时，郭淮引兵杀来。维引兵往来冲突。魏兵阻其去路，密如铁桶。维奋死杀出，折兵大半，飞奔上阳平关来。前面又一军杀到；为首一员大将，纵马横刀而出。那人生得圆面大耳，方口厚唇，左目下生个黑瘤，瘤上生数十根黑毛，乃司马懿长子骠骑将军司马师也。维大怒曰：“孺子焉敢阻吾归路！”拍马挺枪，直来刺师。师挥刀相迎。只三合，杀败了司马师，维脱身径奔阳平关来。城上人开门放入姜维。司马师也来抢关，两边伏弩齐发，一弩发十矢，乃武侯临终时所遗连弩之法也。正是：难支此日三军败，独赖当年十矢传。未知司马师性命如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第一百八回　丁奉雪中奋短兵　孙峻席间施密计\n\n
