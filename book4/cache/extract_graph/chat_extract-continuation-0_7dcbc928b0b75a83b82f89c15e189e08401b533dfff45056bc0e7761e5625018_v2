\n　　是的，生命对他来说，再有什么意义呢？他不能再行走，更不能再开他心爱的汽车；把他和亲爱的大地连结在一起的不再是自己的血肉之躯，而将是两根木头拐杖！本来应该是他照顾老人的晚年，可年迈的双亲将要侍候他以后的生活了……而父母亲离开人世呢？谁再来管他这个残废人？他连个弟兄姐妹也没有！到时，大概只能进养老院，天天坐着轮椅，孤独地看着墙外的树叶发芽、变绿、变黄，又一片片飘落在地上……年复一年，就这样度日过月，寂寞地等待死亡的到来…… \n　　死亡！为什么要用那么漫长的时间去等待死亡？ \n　　是的，尽管人总会一死，但人总是恐惧死而想活在这个世界上。可是，既然活着，就应该活得美好呀！如果人活着是一种受罪，那还不如早早死去，把自己永远从痛苦的深渊里解脱出来！ \n　　死？ \n　　他想：是的，死。也许死对他来说是最合适的。他本来就活得没什么滋味，现在却又失去了双腿，活着就更没什么意思了。 \n　　是的，死！ \n　　他的眼睛一瞬时便被黑暗遮住了。 \n　　可是，在那一片死亡的黑暗中，心灵的宫阙却回荡起铃铛般悦耳的声音，使他不由回过头来，追溯他短暂而平凡的一生…… \n　　他的生命的大部分时间都是在那个亲切的小县城里度过的。他曾有过无忧无虑的童年时灿烂的阳光，美丽的野花，碧波荡漾的原西河，凹凸不平的石板街……他在那里象匹小马驹一样活蹦乱跳地撒过欢。以后，先是在有棵老愧树的小学里开始了学生生活；后来又上了原西中学。无论在学校，还是在家里，那一切回想起来都是温馨的。最后，他上了汽车——就象身上添了两个翅膀，痛快自由地飞驰于东西南北。真正的幸福感是他懂得爱情并热恋上润叶体验到的。但是，人生的不幸也从那时候开始了。是的，他为爱情深深地痛苦了几年，最后导致了这个悲惨的结局……不过，往日的痛苦比之现在来说，那又算得了什么呢？那痛苦是一个健全人的痛苦——某种意义上也是一种幸福！为什么呢？因为你能痛苦，就说明你对生活还抱有希望！可如今的痛苦是绝望的痛苦；绝望的痛苦甚至使人不再痛苦——既然生活没有了希望，还有什么必要再痛苦呢？ \n　　真的，如果痛苦不能改变生存，那还不如平静地将自己毁灭。毁灭。一切都毁灭了，只有生命还在苟延残喘。这\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNKNOWN PERSON<|>PERSON<|>The individual in
