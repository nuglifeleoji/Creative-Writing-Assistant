Many of them are unable to afford the necessary 化肥 due to insufficient wages provided by 孙少安, which hampers their agricultural productivity. This financial constraint highlights the importance of addressing economic issues within the community to ensure that farmers can obtain the fertilizers they need.\n\nIn summary, 化肥 represents not only a critical component of modern agricultural practices in 双水村 but also underscores the economic struggles faced by the villagers in their efforts to sustain their farming activities.

The village is home to several key characters, including Sun Shaoan and Sun Shaoping, who have deep emotional ties to the area, representing their roots and struggles. Historically, the village was influenced by the political ambitions of Tian Futang, a prominent leader focused on improving agricultural practices and community welfare. However, Shuangshui Village is currently facing economic challenges, internal conflicts, and a decline in enthusiasm for public affairs, with residents experiencing economic disparities.\n\nThe village is characterized by its scenic beauty, particularly the picturesque confluence of the Dongla River and Kuye River. It hosts traditional events, such as yangge dance performances and community gatherings, which foster a sense of solidarity among residents. A significant emotional and cultural landmark in the village is its jujube forest, which holds importance for the villagers. Despite its beauty, Shuangshui Village is grappling with a water crisis due to upstream villages monopolizing river resources, leading to desperate conditions for local crops. This situation has prompted community mobilization to reinforce their dam and improve agricultural practices.\n\nShuangshui Village is also a setting for various personal and familial narratives. Sun Shaoan operates a brick-making business that serves as a significant source of livelihood for many villagers, while also facing financial challenges and community expectations. Sun Shaoping, who has returned to the village after time spent in the city, contemplates his future and connection to his past. The village is home to other families, such as the Hai Min couple, who have achieved wealth through fish farming, contrasting with others who struggle to make ends meet.\n\nThe village is undergoing discussions about local governance, labor education, and the implementation of a production responsibility system, reflecting the ongoing evolution of its social and economic landscape.

The river is located near Shuangshui Village (双水村), where it has become a focal point for various events that have captured the villagers' attention, including a major blasting event that has stirred excitement and anxiety among the residents.\n\nThe river is characterized by its soft whimpering sound beneath a broken ice surface, which adds to its poignant atmosphere. It is said to have been formed from the tears of a man who died in sorrow, a narrative that resonates with the local folklore, as well as from the tears of a lover mourning a transformed fairy. This emotional backdrop enhances the river's significance in the community, as it is not only a physical landmark but also a symbol of loss and memory.\n\nKuyin River serves as a crucial passage for various characters in their journeys. For instance, characters like 少平 walk along its banks on their way to 金波's house, while 金俊武 and 金俊山 cross it en route to a funeral, highlighting its role in both daily life and significant life events. The river also acts as a boundary that attackers must cross before reaching 田福堂's home, emphasizing its strategic importance in the narrative.\n\nAdditionally, the river is intertwined with the agricultural practices of the area, impacting local farming and the community's livelihood. It flows through the village, contributing to the somber atmosphere during funerals and other communal gatherings. The river's proximity to a school further underscores its role in the community, as it is a route for children and villagers alike.\n\nAs the community prepares for the dam construction, the river becomes a site of transformation, symbolizing both hope for a better future and the anxiety of change. The juxtaposition of celebratory events alongside the river, such as traditional singing gatherings, illustrates the dual nature of the river as a site of joy and sorrow.\n\nIn summary, Kuyin River is a multifaceted entity that embodies the emotional landscape of the local community, serving as a vital resource, a passage for significant journeys, and a symbol of both loss and hope.
