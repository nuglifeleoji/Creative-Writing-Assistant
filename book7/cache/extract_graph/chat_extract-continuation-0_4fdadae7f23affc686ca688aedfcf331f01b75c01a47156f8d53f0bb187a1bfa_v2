 “总之，我已经找到怀疑石神的理由了，今后我会彻底地盯着他。所以重点来了，昨天虽然决定分道扬镳，但我们能不能订个和平条约？也就是说，我会提供情报给你，相对的你也把你掌握的线索告诉我。怎么样，这样提议不坏吧？”\n    “你太高估我了，我还没掌控任何线索，只是自己的想象而已。”\n    “那么，你就把你的想象说给我听。”草S直直看入好友的眼中。\n    汤川转开脸，迈步走出。“总之先去我的研究室吧。”\n    草S在第十三研究室留有奇妙焦痕的桌前坐下，汤川把两个马克杯放在那上面。老样子，两个杯子都谈不上干净。\n    “如果石神是共犯，那他到底扮演了什么角色？”汤川立刻提出质疑。\n    “我先说吗？”\n    “和平条约可是你主动提议的。”汤川往椅子一坐，悠然啜饮咖啡。\n    “好吧。我还没把石神的事告诉我们老大，这纯粹是我的推理。不过如果命案现场在别处，那么搬运尸体的就是石神。”\n    “喔？你本来不是反对尸体搬运说吗？”\n    “我说过了，如果有共犯就另当别论。不过主犯――也就是实际下手的人――是花冈靖子，说不定石神也有帮忙。总之我确实她一定在场，参与了杀人。”\n    “你这么肯定啊。”\n    “如果实际下手的处理尸体的都是石神，那他就不是共犯，应该是主犯甚至单独犯案了。但就算再怎么痴情，我也不相信他会傻到这种地步。因为靖子一旦背叛他他就完了，她应该也背负了什么风险才对。”\n    “难道不可能是石神独自杀人，然后两人联手弃尸吗？”\n    “我不敢说可能性是零，不过应该相当低。花冈靖子在电影院的不在场证明很暧昧，但那之后的不在场证明倒是很确定。大概是决定好时间才行动的。这么一来，她就不太可能参与不知要花多少时间的弃尸行动。”\n    “花冈靖子的不在场证明目前不确定的是……”\n    “据称在看电影的七点到九点十分之间，后来去拉面店和KTV都已确认属实。不过我想她应该进过电影院，我们已从电影院保存的票根中，找到留有花冈母女指纹的票根了。”\n    “这么说来，你认为靖子和石神利用这两个小时又十分钟的时间杀人？”\n    “或许也包括了弃尸，不过就时间来考虑，靖子极可能先石神一步离开现场。”\n    “杀人现场在哪里？”\n
