大史 \n　　大史在汪淼身边坐下了，将一把车钥匙递给他，“东单口儿上就随便停车，我晚一步就让交警拖走了。”\n　　大史啊，要知道你一直跟在我后面，我至少会有些安慰的。汪淼心里说，但自尊使他没将这话说出口。他接过大史递过来的一枝烟，点上后，抽了戒烟几年后的第一口。\n　　“怎么样老弟，扛不住了吧？我说你不成吧，你还硬充六根脚指头。”\n　　“你不会明白的。”汪淼猛抽几口烟说。\n　　“我是太明白了……那好，去吃饭吧。”\n　　“我不想吃。”\n　　“那去喝酒，我请你！”\n　　汪淼于是上了大史的车，开到附近一家小饭店，天还早，店里没什么人。\n　　“二斤爆肚，一瓶二锅头！”大史喊道，头也不抬，显然对这儿很熟了。\n　　看到端上来的两大盘黑乎乎的东西，汪淼空空的胃翻腾起来，差点吐出来。大史又给他要豆浆和油条，汪淼强迫自己吃了点儿，然后和大史一杯接一杯地喝了起来。他感觉自己轻飘飘的，话也多了起来，将这三天的事情全部向大史说了，虽然他清楚，大史可能都知道，甚至知道的比他还多。\n　　“你是说，宇宙在冲你眨巴眼儿？”大史像吃面条似的吞下半盘爆肚，抬头问。\n　　“这比喻很到位。”\n　　“扯淡。”\n　　“你的无畏来源于无知。”\n　　“还是扯淡，来，干！”\n　　汪淼干了这杯后，感觉世界围绕着自己旋转，只有对面吃爆肚的大史很稳定，他说：“大史啊，你——考虑过一些终极的哲学问题吗？哦，比如说，人类从哪里来，要到哪里去；宇宙从哪里来，要到哪里去之类的。”\n　　“没有。”\n　　“从来没有？”\n　　“从来没有。”\n　　“你总看到过星空吧，难道没有产生过一点敬畏和好奇？”\n　　“我夜里从不看天。”\n　　“怎么可能呢？你们不是常上夜班吗？”\n　　“老弟，我夜里蹲\n######################\nOutput:",
