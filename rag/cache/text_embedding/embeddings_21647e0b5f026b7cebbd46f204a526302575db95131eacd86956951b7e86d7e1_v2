talking once more: “There’s another useful concept that I’m sure your mother taught you—the key log.”\nOdrade was very curious now. Taraza was headed somewhere important with this conversation. Key log: a truly ancient concept from the days before suspensors when lumbermen sent their fallen timber rushing down rivers to central mill sites. Sometimes the logs jammed up in the river and an expert was brought in to find the one log, the key log, which would free the jam when removed. Teg, she knew, would have an intellectual understanding of the term but she and Taraza could call up actual witnesses from Other Memories, see the explosion of broken bits of wood and water as a jam was released.\n“The Tyrant was a key log,” Taraza said. “He created the jam and he released it.”\nThe lighter began trembling sharply as it took its first bite of Gammu’s atmosphere. Odrade felt the tightness of her restraining harness for a few seconds, then the craft’s passage became steadier. Conversation stopped for this interval, then Taraza continued:\n“Beyond the so-called natural dependencies are some religions that have been created psychologically. Even physical necessities can have such an underground component.”\n“A fact the Missionaria Protectiva understands quite well,” Teg said. Again, Odrade heard that undercurrent of deep resentment in his voice. Taraza certainly must hear it, too. What was she doing? She could weaken Teg!\n“Ahhh, yes,” Taraza said. “Our Missionaria Protectiva. Humans have such a powerful need that their own belief\nstructure be the ‘true belief.’ If it gives you pleasure or a sense of security and if it is incorporated into your belief structure, what a powerful dependency that creates!”\nAgain, Taraza fell silent while their lighter went through another atmospheric buffeting.\n“I wish he would use his suspensors!” Taraza complained.\n“It saves fuel,” Teg said. “Less dependency.”\nTaraza chuckled. “Oh, yes, Miles. You know the lesson well. | see your mother’s hand in it. Damn the dam when the child strikes out in a dangerous direction.”\n“You think of me as a child?” he asked.\n“I think of you as someone who has just had his first direct encounter with the machinations of the so-called Honored Matres.”\nSo that’s it, Odrade thought. And with a feeling of shock, Odrade realized that Taraza was aiming her words ata broader target than just Teg.\nShe’s talking to me!\n“These Honored Matres, as they call themselves,” Taraza said, “have combined sexual ecstasy and worship. | doubt that they have even guessed at the dangers.”\nOdrade opened her eyes and looked across the aisle at the Mother Superior. Taraza’s gaze was fixed intently on Teg, an unreadable expression except for the eyes, which burned with the necessity for him to understand.\n“Dangers,” Taraza repeated. “The great mass of humankind possesses an unmistakable unit-identity. It can be one thing. It can act as a single organism.”\n“So the Tyrant said,” Teg countered.\n“So the Tyrant demonstrated! The Group Soul was his to manipulate. There are times, Miles, when survival demands that we commune with the soul. Souls, you know, are always seeking outlet.”\n“Hasn't communing with souls gone out of style in our time?” Teg asked. Odrade did not like the bantering tone in\nhis voice and noted that it aroused a matching anger in Taraza.\n“You think | talk about fashions in religion?” Taraza demanded, her high-pitched voice insistently harsh. “We both know religions can be created! I’m talking about these Honored Matres who ape some of our ways but have none of our deeper awareness. They dare place themselves at the center of worship!”\n“A thing the Bene Gesserit always avoids,” he said. “My mother said that worshipers and the worshiped are united by the faith.”\n“And they can be divided!”\nOdrade saw Teg suddenly fall into Mentat mode, an unfocused stare in his eyes, his features placid. She saw now part of what Taraza was doing. The Mentat rides Roman, one foot on each steed. Each foot is based on a different reality as the pattern-search hurtles him forward. He must ride different realities to a single goal.\nTeg spoke in a Mentat’s musing, unaccented voice: “Divided forces will battle for supremacy.”\nTaraza gave a sigh of pleasure almost sensual in its natural venting.\n“Dependency infrastructure,” Taraza said. “These women from the Scattering would control dividing forces, all of those forces trying mightily to take the lead. That military officer on the Guildship, when he spoke of his Honored Matres, spoke with both awe and hatred. I’m sure you heard it in his voice, Miles. | know how well your mother taught you.”\n“| heard.” Teg was once more focused on Taraza, hanging on her every word as was Odrade.\n“Dependencies,” Taraza said. “How simple they can be and how complex. Take, for example, tooth decay.”\n“Tooth decay?” Teg was shocked off his Mentat track and Odrade, observing this, saw that his reaction was precisely\nwhat Taraza wanted. Taraza was playing her Mentat Bashar with a fine hand.\nAnd I am supposed to see this and learn from it, Odrade thought.\n“Tooth decay,” Taraza repeated. “A simple implant at birth prevents this bane for most of humankind. Still, we must brush the teeth and otherwise care for them. It is so natural to us that we seldom think about it. The devices we use are assumed to be wholly ordinary parts of our environment. Yet the devices, the materials in them, the instructors in tooth care and the Suk monitors, all have their interlocked relationships.”\n“A Mentat does not need interdependencies explained to him,” Teg said. There was still curiosity in his voice but with a definite undertone of resentment.\n“Quite,” Taraza said. “That is the natural environment of a Mentat’s thinking process.”\n“Then why do you belabor this?”\n“Mentat, look at what you now know of these Honored Matres and tell me: What is their flaw?”\nTeg spoke without hesitation: “They can only survive if they continue to increase the dependency of those who Support them. It’s an addict’s dead-end street.”\n“Precisely. And the danger?”\n“They could take much of humankind down with them.”\n“That was the Tyrant’s problem, Miles. I’m sure he knew it. Now, pay attention to me with great care. And you, too, Dar.” Taraza looked across the aisle and met Odrade’s gaze. “Both of you listen to me. We of the Bene Gesserit are setting very powerful... elements adrift in the human current. They may jam up. They are sure to cause damage. And we...”\nOnce more, the lighter entered a period of severe buffeting. Conversation was impossible while they clung to their seats and listened to the roaring, creaking around them. When this interruption eased, Taraza raised her voice.\n“If we survive this damnable machine and get down to Gammu, you must go aside with Dar there, Miles. You have seen the Atreides Manifesto. She will tell you about it and prepare you. That is all.”\nTeg turned and looked at Odrade. Once more, her features tugged at his memories: a remarkable likeness to Lucilla, but there was something else. He put this aside. The Atreides Manifesto? He had read it because it came to him from Taraza with instructions that he do so. Prepare me? For what?\nOdrade saw the questioning look on Teg’s face. Now, she understood Taraza’s motive. The Mother Superior’s orders took on a new meaning as did words from the Manifesto itself.\n“Just as the universe is created by the participation of consciousness, the prescient human carries that creative faculty to its ultimate extreme. This was the profoundly misunderstood power of the Atreides bastard, the power that he transmitted to his son, the Tyrant.”\nOdrade knew those words with an author’s intimacy but they came back to her now as though she had never before encountered them.\nDamn you, Tar! Odrade thought. What if you’re wrong?\nAt the quantum level our universe can be seen as an indeterminate place, predictable in a statistical way only when you employ large enough numbers. Between that universe and a relatively predictable one where the passage of a single planet can be timed to a picosecond, other forces come into play. For the in-between universe where we find our daily lives, that which you believe is a dominant force. Your beliefs order the unfolding of daily events. If enough of us believe, a new thing can be made to exist. Belief structure creates a filter through which chaos is sifted into order.\n—ANALYSIS OF THE TYRANT, THE TARAZA FILE: BG ARCHIVES\neg’s thoughts were in turmoil as he returned to Gammu\nfrom the Guildship. He stepped from the lighter at the black-charred edge of the Keep’s private landing field and looked around him as though for the first time. Almost noon. So little time had passed and so much had changed.\nTo what extent would the Bene Gesserit go in imparting an essential lesson? he wondered. Taraza had dislodged him from his familiar Mentat processes. He felt that the whole incident on the Guildship had been staged just for him. He had been shaken from a predictable course. How strange Gammu appeared as he crossed the guarded strip to the entry pits.\nTeg had seen many planets, learned their ways and how they printed themselves on their inhabitants. Some planets had a big yellow sun that sat in close and kept living things warm, evolving, growing. Some planets had little shimmer- suns that hung far away in a dark sky, and their light touched very little. Variations existed within and even outside this range. Gammu was a yellow-green variation with a day of 31.27 standard hours and a 2.6 SY. Teg had thought he knew Gammu.\nWhen the Harkonnens were forced to abandon it, colonists left behind by the Scattering came from the Danian group, calling it by the Halleck name given to it in the great remapping. The colonists had been known as Caladanian in those days but millennia tended to shorten some labels.\nTeg paused at the entryway to the protective revetments that led from the field down beneath the Keep. Taraza and her party lagged behind him. He saw Taraza was talking intently to Odrade.\nAtreides Manifesto, he thought.\nEven on Gammu, few admitted to either Harkonnen or Atreides ancestry, although the genotypes were visible here —especially the dominant Atreides: those long, sharp noses, the high foreheads and sensual mouths. Often, the pieces were scattered—the mouth on one face, those piercing eyes on another and countless mixtures. Sometimes, though, one person carried it all and then you saw the pride, that inner knowledge:\n“lam one of them!”\nGammu’s natives recognized it and gave it walkway room but few labeled it.\nUnderlying all of this was what the Harkonnens had left behind—genetic lines tracing far away into the dawn times of Greek and Pathan and Mameluke, shadows of ancient history that few outside of professional historians or those trained by the Bene Gesserit could even name.\nTaraza and her party caught up with Teg. He heard her say to Odrade: “You must tell Miles all of it.”\nVery well, she would tell him, he thought. He turned", "reides ancestry, although the genotypes were visible here —especially the dominant Atreides: those long, sharp noses, the high foreheads and sensual mouths.

He heard her say to Odrade: “You must tell Miles all of it.”\nVery well, she would tell him, he thought. He turned and led the way past the inner guards to the long passage under the pillboxes into the Keep proper.\nDamn the Bene Gesserit! he thought. What were they really doing here on Gammu?\nPlenty of Bene Gesserit signs could be seen on this planet: the back-breeding to fix selected traits, and here\nand there a visible emphasis on seductive eyes for women.\nTeg returned a guard captain’s salute without changing focus. Seductive eyes, yes. He had seen this soon after his arrival at the ghola’s Keep and especially during his first inspection tour of the planet. He had seen himself in many faces, too, and recalled the thing old Patrin had mentioned SO many times.\n“You have the Gammu look, Bashar.”\nSeductive eyes! That guard captain back there had them. She and Odrade and Lucilla were alike in this. Few people paid much attention to the importance of eyes when it came to seduction, he thought. It took a Bene Gesserit upbringing to make that point. Big breasts in a woman and hard loins in a man (that tightly muscular look to the buttocks)—these were naturally important in sexual matchings. But without the eyes, the rest of it could go for nothing. Eyes were essential. You could drown in the right kind of eyes, he had learned, sink right into them and be unaware of what was being done to you until penis was firmly clasped in vagina.\nHe had noted Lucilla’s eyes immediately after his arrival on Gammu and had walked cautiously. No doubts about how the Sisterhood used her talents!\nThere was Lucilla now, waiting at the central inspection and decontamination chamber. She gave him the flickering handsign that all was well with the ghola. Teg relaxed and watched as Lucilla and Odrade confronted each other. The two women had remarkably similar features despite the age difference. Their bodies were quite different, though, Lucilla more solid against Odrade’s willowy form.\nThe guard captain of the seductive eyes came up beside Teg and leaned close to him. “Schwangyu has just learned who you brought back with you,” she said, nodding toward Taraza. “Ahhh, there she is now.”\nSchwangyu stepped from a lift tube and crossed to Taraza, giving only an angry glare to Teg.\nTaraza wanted to surprise you, he thought. We all know why.\n“You don’t appear happy to see me,” Taraza said, addressing Schwangyu.\n“I am surprised, Mother Superior,” Schwangyu said. “l had no idea.” She glanced once more at Teg, a look of venom in her eyes.\nOdrade and Lucilla broke off their mutual examination. “l had heard about it, of course,” Odrade said, “but itis a stopper to confront yourself in the face of another person.”\n“| warned you,” Taraza said.\n“What are your orders, Mother Superior?” Schwangyu asked. It was as close as she could come to asking the purpose of Taraza’s visit.\n“I would like a private word with Lucilla,” Taraza said.\n“PIL have quarters prepared for you,” Schwangyu said.\n“Don’t bother,” Taraza said. “I’m not staying. Miles has already arranged for my transport. Duty requires my presence at Chapter House. Lucilla and | will talk outside in the courtyard.” Taraza put a finger to her cheek. “Oh, and I'd like to watch the ghola unobserved for a few minutes. I’m sure Lucilla can arrange it.”\n“He’s taking the more intense training quite well,” Lucilla said as the two moved off toward a lift tube.\nTeg turned his attention to Odrade, noting as his gaze passed across Schwangyu’s face the intensity of her anger. She was not trying to conceal it.\nWas Lucilla a sister or a daughter of Odrade? Teg wondered. It occurred to him suddenly that there must be a Bene Gesserit purpose behind the resemblance. Yes, of course—Lucilla was an Imprinter!\nSchwangyu overcame her anger. She looked with curiosity at Odrade. “I was just about to take lunch, Sister,” Schwangyu said. “Would you care to join me?”\n“I must have a word alone with the Bashar,” Odrade said. “If it is all right, perhaps we could remain here for our talk? |\nmust not be seen by the ghola.”\nSchwangyu scowled, not trying to hide her upset from Odrade. They knew at Chapter House where loyalties lay! But no one...no one! would remove her from this post of observational command. Opposition had its rights!\nHer thoughts were clear even to Teg. He noted the stiffness of Schwangyu’s back as she left them.\n“It is bad when Sister is turned against Sister,” Odrade said.\nTeg gave a handsign to his guard captain, ordering her to clear the area. Alone, Odrade said. Alone it would be. To Odrade, he said: “This is one of my areas. No spies or other means of observing us here.”\n“I thought as much,” Odrade said.\n“We have a service room over there.” Teg nodded to his left. “Furniture, even chairdogs if you prefer.”\n“I hate it when they try to cuddle me,” she said. “Could we talk here?” She put a hand under Teg’s arm. “Perhaps we could walk a bit. | got so stiff sitting in that lighter.”\n“What is it you’re supposed to tell me?” he asked as they strolled.\n“My memories are no longer selectively filtered,” she said. “I have them all, only on the female side, naturally.”\n“So?” Teg pursed his lips. This was not the overture he had expected. Odrade appeared more like one who would take off on a direct approach.\n“Taraza says you have read the Atreides Manifesto. Good. You know it will cause upset in many quarters.”\n“Schwangyu already has made it the subject of a diatribe against ‘you Atreides.’”\nOdrade stared at him solemnly. As the reports all said, Teg remained an imposing figure, but she had known that without the reports.\n“We are both Atreides, you and l,” Odrade said.\nTeg came to full alert.\n“Your mother explained that to you in detail,” Odrade said, “when you took your first school leave back to Lernaeus.”\nTeg stopped and stared down at her. How could she know this? To his knowledge, he had never before met and conversed with this remote Darwi Odrade. Was he the Subject of special discussions at Chapter House? He held his silence, forcing her to carry the conversation.\n“I will recount a conversation between a man and my birth-mother,” Odrade said. “They are in bed and the man says: ‘I fathered a few children when | first escaped from the close bondage of the Bene Gesserit, back when | thought myself an independent agent, free to enlist and fight anywhere | chose.’”\nTeg did not try to conceal his surprise. Those were his own words! Mentat memory told him Odrade had them down as accurately as a mechanical recorder. Even the tone!\n“More?” she asked as he continued to stare at her. “Very well. The man says: ‘That was before they sent me to Mentat training, of course. What an eye-opener that was! | had never been out of the Sisterhood’s sight for an instant! | was never a free agent.’”\n“Not even when | spoke those words,” Teg said.\n“True.” She urged him by pressure on his arm as they continued their stroll across the chamber. “The children you fathered all belonged to the Bene Gesserit. The Sisterhood takes no chances that our genotype will be sent into the wild gene pool.”\n“Let my body go to Shaitan, their precious genotype remains in Sisterhood care,” he said.\n“My care,” Odrade said. “I am one of your daughters.”\nAgain, he forced her to stop.\n“I think you know who my mother was,” she said. She held up a hand for silence as he started to respond. “Names are not necessary.”\nTeg studied Odrade’s features, seeing the recognizable signs there. Mother and daughter were matched. But what of Lucilla?\nAs though she heard his question, Odrade said: “Lucilla is from a parallel breeding line. Quite remarkable, isn’t it, what careful breed-matching can achieve?”\nTeg cleared his throat. He felt no emotional attachment to this newly revealed daughter. Her words and other important signals of her performance demanded his primary attention.\n“This is no casual conversation,” he said. “Is this all of what you were to reveal to me? | thought the Mother Superior said...”\n“There is more,” Odrade agreed. “The Manifesto—| am its author. | wrote it at Taraza’s orders and following her detailed instructions.”\nTeg glanced around the large chamber as though to make sure no one overheard. He spoke in a lowered voice: “The Tleilaxu are spreading it far and wide!”\n“Just as we hoped.”\n“Why are you telling me this? Taraza said you were to prepare me for...”\n“There will come a time when you must know our purpose. It is Taraza’s wish that you make your own decisions then, that you really become a free agent.”\nEven as she spoke, Odrade saw the Mentat glaze in his eyes.\nTeg breathed deeply. Dependencies and key logs! He felt the Mentat sense of an enormous pattern just beyond the reach of his accumulated data. He did not even consider for an instant that some form of filial devotion had prompted these revelations. There was a fundamentalist, dogmatic, and ritualistic essence apparent in all Bene Gesserit training despite every effort to prevent this. Odrade, this daughter out of his past, was a full Reverend Mother with extraordinary powers of muscle and nerve control—full\nmemories on the female side! She was one of the special ones! She knew tricks of violence that few humans ever suspected. Still, that similarity, that essence remained and a Mentat always saw it.\nWhat does she want?\nAffirmation of his paternity? She already had all of the confirmation she could need.\nObserving her now, the way she waited so patiently for his thoughts to resolve, Teg reflected that it often was said with truth that Reverend Mothers no longer were completely members of the human race. They moved somehow outside the main flow, perhaps parallel to it, perhaps diving into it occasionally for their own purposes, but always removed from humankind. They removed themselves. It was an identifying mark of the Reverend Mother, a sense of extra identity that made them closer to the long-dead Tyrant than", " prevent this.

It was an identifying mark of the Reverend Mother, a sense of extra identity that made them closer to the long-dead Tyrant than to the human stock from which they sprang.\nManipulation. That was their mark. They manipulated everyone and everything.\n“lam to be the Bene Gesserit eyes,” Teg said. “Taraza wants me to make a human decision for all of you.”\nObviously pleased, Odrade squeezed his arm. “What a father | have!”\n“Do you really have a father?” he asked and he recounted for her what he had been thinking about the Bene Gesserit removing themselves from humanity.\n“Outside humanity,” she said. “What a curious idea. Are Guild navigators also outside their original humanity?”\nHe thought about this. Guild navigators diverged widely from humankind’s more common shape. Born in space and living out their lives in tanks of melange gas, they distorted the original form, elongated and repositioned limbs and organs. But a young navigator in estrus and before entering the tank could breed with a norm. It had been demonstrated. They became non-human but not in the way of the Bene Gesserit.\n“Navigators are not your mental kin,” he said. “They think human. Guiding a ship through space, even with prescience to find the safe way, has a pattern a human can accept.”\n“You don’t accept our pattern?”\n“As far as | can, but somewhere in your development you shift outside the original pattern. | think you may perform a conscious act even to appear human. This way you hold my arm right now, as though you really were my daughter.”\n“I am your daughter but I’m surprised you think so little of us.”\n“Quite the contrary: | stand in awe of you.”\n“Of your own daughter?”\n“Of any Reverend Mother.”\n“You think | exist only to manipulate lesser creatures?”\n“I think you no longer really feel human. There’s a gap in you, something missing, something you’ve removed. You no longer are one of us.”\n“Thank you,” Odrade said. “Taraza told me you would not hesitate to answer truthfully, but | knew that for myself.”\n“For what have you prepared me?”\n“You will know it when it occurs; that is all I cansay... all | am permitted to say.”\nManipulating again! he thought. Damn them!\nOdrade cleared her throat. She appeared about to say something more but she remained silent as she guided Teg around and strolled with him back across the chamber.\nEven though she had known what Teg must say, his words pained her. She wanted to tell him that she was one of those who still felt human, but his judgment of the Sisterhood could not be denied.\nWe are taught to reject love. We can simulate it but each of us is capable of cutting it off in an instant.\nThere were sounds behind them. They stopped and turned. Lucilla and Taraza emerged from a lift tube speaking idly about their observations of the ghola.\n“You are absolutely right to treat him as one of us,” Taraza said.\nTeg heard but made no comment as they awaited the approach of the two women.\nHe knows, Odrade thought. He will not ask me about my birth-mother. There was no bonding, no real imprint. Yes, he knows.\nOdrade closed her eyes and memory startled her by producing of itself an image of a painting. The thing occupied a space on the wall of Taraza’s morning room. Ixian artifice had preserved the painting in the finest hermetically sealed frame behind a cover of invisible plaz. Odrade often stopped in front of the painting, feeling each time that her hand might reach out and actually touch the ancient Canvas so cunningly preserved by the Ixians.\nCottages at Cordeville.\nThe artist’s name for his work and his own name were preserved on a burnished plate beneath the painting: Vincent Van Gogh.\nThe thing dated from a time so ancient that only rare remnants such as this painting remained to send a physical impression down the ages. She had tried to imagine the journeys that painting had taken, the serial chance that had brought it intact to Taraza’s room.\nThe Ixians had been at their best in the preservation and restoration. An observer could touch a dark spot on the lower left corner of the frame. Immediately, you were engulfed in the true genius, not only of the artist, but of the Ixian who had restored and preserved the work. His name was there on the frame: Martin Buro. When touched by the human finger, the dot became a sense projector, a benign spin-off of the technology that had produced the Ixian Probe. Buro had restored not only the painting but the painter—Van Gogh's feeling—accompaniment to each brush stroke. All had been captured in the brush strokes, recorded there by human movements.\nOdrade had stood there engrossed through the whole performance so many times she felt she could re-create the painting independently.\nRecalling this experience so near to Teg’s accusation, she knew at once why her memory had reproduced the image for her, why that painting still fascinated her. For the brief space of that replay she always felt totally human, aware of the cottages as places where real people dwelled, aware in some complete way of the living chain that had paused there in the person of the mad Vincent Van Gogh, paused to record itself.\nTaraza and Lucilla stopped about two paces from Teg and Odrade. There was a smell of garlic on Taraza’s breath.\n“We stopped for a small bite to eat,” Taraza said. “Would you like anything?”\nIt was exactly the wrong question. Odrade freed her hand from Teg’s arm. She turned quickly and wiped her eyes on her cuff. Looking up once more at Teg, she saw surprise on his face. Yes, she thought, those were real tears!\n“I think we’ve done everything here that we can,” Taraza said.\n“It’s time you were on your way to Rakis, Dar.”\n“Past time,” Odrade said.\nLife cannot find reasons to sustain it, cannot be a source of decent mutual regard, unless each of us resolves to breathe such qualities into it.\n—CHENOEH: “CONVERSATIONS WITH LETO II”\nH edley Tuek, High Priest of the Divided God, had grown increasingly angry with Stiros. Although too old himself ever to hope for the High Priest’s bench, Stiros had sons, grandsons, and numerous nephews. Stiros had transferred his personal ambitions to his family. A cynical man, Stiros. He represented a powerful faction in the priesthood, the so- called scientific community, whose influence was insidious and pervasive. They veered dangerously close to heresy.\nTuek reminded himself that more than one High Priest had been /ost in the desert, regrettable accidents. Stiros and his faction were capable of creating such an accident.\nIt was afternoon in Keen and Stiros had just departed, obviously frustrated. Stiros wanted Tuek to go into the desert and personally observe Sheeana’s next venture there. Suspicious of the invitation, Tuek declined.\nA strange argument ensued, full of innuendo and vague references to Sheeana’s behavior plus wordy attacks on the Bene Gesserit. Stiros, always suspicious of the Sisterhood, had taken an immediate dislike to the new commander of the Bene Gesserit Keep on Rakis, this .. . what was her name? Oh, yes, Odrade. Odd name but then the Sisters often took odd names. That was their privilege. God Himself had never spoken against the basic goodness of the Bene Gesserit. Against individual Sisters, yes, but the Sisterhood itself had shared God’s Holy Vision.\nTuek did not like the way Stiros spoke of Sheeana. Cynical. Tuek had finally silenced Stiros with pronouncements delivered here in the Sanctus with its high altar and images of the Divided God. Prismatic beam-relays cast thin wedges of brilliance through drifting incense from burning melange onto the double line of tall pillars that led up to the altar. Tuek knew his words went directly to God from this setting.\n“God works through our latter-day Siona,” Tuek had told Stiros, noting the confusion on the old councillor’s face. “Sheeana is the living reminder of Siona, that human instrument who translated Him into His present Divisions.”\nStiros raged, saying things he would not dare repeat before the full Council. He presumed too much on his long association with Tuek.\n“I tell you she is sitting here surrounded by adults intent upon justifying themselves to her and—”\n“And to God!” Tuek could not let such words pass.\nLeaning close to the High Priest, Stiros grated: “She is at the center of an educational system geared to anything her imagination demands. We deny her nothing!”\n“Nor should we.”\nIt was as though Tuek had not spoken. Stiros said, “Cania has provided her with recordings from Dar-es-Balat!”\n“I am the Book of Fate,” Tuek intoned, quoting God’s own words from the hoard at Dar-es-Balat.\n“Exactly! And she listens to every word!”\n“Why does this disturb you?” Tuek asked in his calmest tone.\n“We don’t test her knowledge. She tests ours!”\n“God must want it so.”\nNo mistaking the bitter anger on Stiros’ face. Tuek observed this and waited while the old councillor marshaled new arguments. Resources for such arguments were, of course, enormous. Tuek did not deny this. It was the interpretations that mattered. Which was why a High Priest\nmust be the final interpreter. Despite (or perhaps because of) their way of viewing history, the priesthood knew a great deal of how God had come to reside on Rakis. They had Dar- es-Balat itself and all of its contents—the earliest known no- chamber in the universe. For millennia, while Shai-hulud translated the verdant planet of Arrakis into desert-Rakis, Dar-es-Balat waited under the sands. From that Holy Hoard, the priesthood possessed God’s own voice, His printed words and even holophotos. Everything was explained and they knew that the desert surface of Rakis reproduced the original form of the planet, the way it looked in the beginning when it was the only known source of the Holy Spice.\n“She asks about God’s family,” Stiros said. “Why should she have to ask about—”\n“She tests us. Do we give Them Their proper places? The Reverend Mother Jessica to her son, Muad’Dib, to his son, Leto II—the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven.”\n“Leto Ill,” Stiros muttered. “What of the other Leto who died at Sardaukar hands? What of him?”\n“Careful, Stiros,” Tuek intoned. “You know my great- grandfather pronounced upon that question from this very bench.
