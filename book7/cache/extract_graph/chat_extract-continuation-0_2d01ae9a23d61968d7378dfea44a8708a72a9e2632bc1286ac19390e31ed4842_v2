“什么那边？”她有不好的预感。\n    “既然老婆不肯听我说，那我当然只好去见女儿。她的国中就在附近吧？”男人说出靖子最害怕听到的话。\n    “不行，你不能去找那孩子。”\n    “那你就自己想办法解决，反正我找谁都无所谓。”\n    靖子叹了一口气，总之她现在只想把这个男人赶走。\n    “我六点下班。”\n    “从清早做到傍晚六点啊，老板也太压榨人了吧。”\n    “不关你的事”\n    “那，我六点再过来就行了吧？”\n    “别来这里。前面的马路往右一直走，有个很大的十字路口，边上有间家庭速食餐厅，你六点半去那里。”\n    “知道了，你一定要来喔。如果你不来――”\n    “我会去的，所以。拜托你快走。”\n    “知道了，真无情。”男人又环顾店内一次才离开。临走时，还用力甩上玻璃门。\n    靖子手撑着额头，她的头开始隐隐作痛，甚至想吐。绝望感在她的心头弥漫。\n    她在八年前和富坚慎二结婚。当时，靖子在赤坂当酒女，他是来捧场的客人之一。\n    负责销售进口车的富坚出手阔绰，不但送她昂贵礼物，还带她上高级餐厅。所以当他开口求婚时，她觉得自己简直就像电影“麻雀变凤凰”中的朱丽叶罗伯茨。靖子的第一段婚姻失败了，对于一边工作一边抚养女儿的生活正感到疲惫。\n    刚结婚时很幸福。富坚的收入很稳定，所以靖子不用在陪酒。他也很疼爱美里，美里似乎也努力把他当父亲看待。\n    但悲剧骤然降临。富坚长年挪用公款东窗事发，遭到公司开除。而公司之所以没控告他，是因为那些上司害怕上面追究管理责任，遂巧妙地掩饰事态。说穿了很简单，富坚在赤坂挥霍的，全是他贪污来的钱。\n    从此，富坚就性情大变，不、或许该说露出本性，不是游手好闲饱食终日，就是出去赌博。要是抱怨他两句，他还会动粗打人。酒也越喝越多，总是醉得颠三倒四，目露凶光。\n    因此靖子不得不再次上班，但她赚来的钱，都被富坚抢走了。她学会把钱藏起来后，他甚至在发薪日抢先一步去她店里，擅自领走她的薪水。\n    美里变得很怕这个继父，不肯在家跟他独处，甚至宁愿跑去靖子上班的酒廊待着。\n    靖子向富坚提出离婚，但他充耳不闻。如果她契而不舍的再三要求，他就会再次动粗。她在苦恼多日后，找了一个\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>靖子<|>PERSON<|>靖子 is a woman who is struggling
