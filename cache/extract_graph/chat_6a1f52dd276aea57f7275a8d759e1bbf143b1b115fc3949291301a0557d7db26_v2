There was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without talking.\nWe must not lose that man, Jessica thought. Paul’s plan must work. Anything else would be the highest tragedy.\nShe strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down into the crowd. A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul. And silence followed her.\nShe knew the meaning of the silence—the unspoken questions of the people, awe of the Reverend Mother.\nThe young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him. “AN men beneath your position covet your station,” went the Bene Gesserit axiom. But she found no covetousness in these faces. They were held ata distance by the religious ferment around Paul’s leadership. And she recalled another Bene Gesserit saying: “Prophets have a way of dying by violence.”\nPaul looked at her.\n“It’s time,” she said, and passed the message cylinder to him.\nOne of Paul’s companions, bolder than the others, glanced across at Stilgar, said: “Are you going to call him out, Muad’Dib? Now’s the time for sure. They'll think you a coward if you—”\n“Who dares call me coward?” Paul demanded. His hand flashed to his crysknife hilt.\nBated silence came over the group, spreading out into the crowd.\n“There’s work to do,” Paul said as the man drew back from him. Paul turned away, shouldered through the crowd to the ledge, leaped lightly up to it and faced the people.\n“Do it!” someone shrieked.\nMurmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek.\nPaul waited for silence. It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and coughs. When it was quiet in the cavern, Paul lifted his chin, spoke in a voice that carried to the farthest corners.\n“You are tired of waiting,” Paul said.\nAgain, he waited while the cries of response died out.\nIndeed, they are tired of waiting, Paul thought. He hefted the message cylinder, thinking of what it contained. His mother had showed it to him, explaining how it had been taken from a Harkonnen courier.\nThe message was explicit: Rabban was being abandoned to his own resources here on Arrakis! He could not call for help or reinforcements!\nAgain, Paul raised his voice: “You think it’s time | called out Stilgar and changed the leadership of the troops!” Before they could respond, Paul hurled his voice at them in anger: “Do you think the Lisan al- Gaib that stupid?”\nThere was stunned silence.\nHe’s accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thought. He must not do it!\n“It’s the way!” someone shouted.\nPaul spoke dryly, probing the emotional undercurrents. “Ways change.”\nAn angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern: “We'll say what’s to change!”\nThere were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng.\n“As you wish,” Paul said.\nAnd Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of Voice she had taught him.\n“You will say,” he agreed. “But first you will hear my say.”\nStilgar moved along the ledge, his bearded face impassive. “That is the way, too,” he said. “The voice of any Fremen may be heard in Council. Paul- Muad’Dib is a Fremen.”\n“The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?” Paul asked.\nStill with that flat-voiced dignity, Stilgar said: “Thus our steps are guided.”\n“All right,” Paul said. “Then, who rules this troop of our tribe—and who rules all the tribes and troops through the fighting instructors we’ve trained in the weirding way?”\nPaul waited, looking over the heads of the throng. No answer came.\nPresently, he said: “Does Stilgar rule all this? He says himself that he does not. Do | rule? Even Stilgar does my bidding on occasion, and the sages, the wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council.”\nThere was shuffling silence among the crowd.\n“So,” Paul said. “Does my mother rule?” He pointed down to Jessica in her black robes of office among them. “Stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask her advice in almost every major decision. You know this. But does a Reverend Mother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the Harkonnens?”\nFrowns creased the foreheads of those Paul could see, but still there were angry murmurs.\nThis is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the message cylinder and what it implied. And she saw Paul’s intent: Go right to the depth of their uncertainty, dispose of that, and all the rest must follow.\n“No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh?” Paul asked.\n“That’s the way!” someone shouted.\n“What’s our goal?” Paul asked. “To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast, and remake our world into a place where we may raise our families in happiness amidst an abundance of water—is this our goal?”\n“Hard tasks need hard ways,” someone shouted.\n“Do you smash your knife before a battle?” Paul demanded. “I say this as fact, not meaning it as boast or challenge: there isn’t a man here, Stilgar included, who could stand against me in single combat. This is Stilgar’s own admission. He knows it, SO do you all.”\nAgain, the angry mutters lifted from the crowd.\n“Many of you have been with me on the practice floor,” Paul said. “You know this isn’t idle boast. | say it because it’s fact known to us all, and I'd be foolish not to see it for myself. | began training in these ways\nearlier than you did and my teachers were tougher than any you've ever seen. How else do you think | bested Jamis at an age when your boys are still fighting only mock battles?”\nHe’s using the Voice well, Jessica thought, but that’s not enough with these people. They’ve good insulation against vocal control. He must catch them also with logic.\n“So,” Paul said, “we come to this.” He lifted the message cylinder, removed its scrap of tape. “This was taken from a Harkonnen courier. Its authenticity is beyond question. It is addressed to Rabban. It tells him that his request for new troops is denied, that his spice harvest is far below quota, that he must wring more spice from Arrakis with the people he has.”\nStilgar moved up beside Paul.\n“How many of you see what this means?” Paul asked. “Stilgar saw it immediately.”\n“They’re cut off!” someone shouted.\nPaul pushed message and cylinder into his sash. From his neck he took a braided shigawire cord and removed a ring from the cord, holding the ring aloft.\n“This was my father’s ducal signet,” he said. “I swore never to wear it again until | was ready to lead my troops over all of Arrakis and claim it as my rightful fief.” He put the ring on his finger, clenched his fist.\nUtter stillness gripped the cavern.\n“Who rules here?” Paul asked. He raised his fist. “l rule here! | rule on every square inch of Arrakis! This IS my ducal fief whether the Emperor says yea or\nnay! He gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father!”\nPaul lifted himself onto his toes, settled back to his heels. He studied the crowd, feeling their temper.\nAlmost, he thought.\n“There are men here who will hold positions of importance on Arrakis when | claim those Imperial rights which are mine,” Paul said. “Stilgar is one of those men. Not because | wish to bribe him! Not out of gratitude, though I’m one of many here who owe him life for life. No! But because he’s wise and strong. Because he governs this troop by his own intelligence and not just by rules. Do you think me stupid? Do you think l'Il cut off my right arm and leave it bloody on the floor of this cavern just to provide you with a circus?”\nPaul swept a hard gaze across the throng. “Who is there here to say I’m not the rightful ruler on Arrakis? Must | prove it by leaving every Fremen tribe in the erg without a leader?”\nBeside Paul, Stilgar stirred, looked at him questioningly.\n“Will | subtract from our strength when we need it most?” Paul asked. “I am your ruler, and | say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men and Started killing our real enemies—the Harkonnens!”\nIn one blurred motion, Stilgar had his crysknife out and pointed over the heads of the throng. “Long live Duke Paul-Muad’Dib!” he shouted.\nA deafening roar filled the cavern, echoed and re- echoed. They were cheering and chanting: “Ya hya\nchouhada! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Ya hya chouhada!”\nJessica translated it to herself: “Long live the fighters of Muad’Dib!” The scene she and Paul and Stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as they’d planned.\nThe tumult died slowly.\nWhen silence was restored, Paul faced Stilgar, said: “Kneel, Stilgar.”\nStilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge.\n“Hand me your crysknife,” Paul said.\nStilgar obeyed.\nThis was not as we planned it, Jessica thought.\n“Repeat after me, Stilgar,” Paul said, and he called up the words of investiture as he had heard his own father use them. “I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke.”\n“|, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke,” Stilgar said, and accepted the milky blade from Paul.\n“Where my Duke commands, there shall I place this blade,” Paul said.\nStilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly.\nRemembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her head. / know the reasons for this, she thought. / shouldn't let it stir me.\n“I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his enemies for as long as our blood Shall flow,” Paul said.\nStilgar repeated it after him.\n“Kiss the blade,” Paul ordered.\nStilgar obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Paul’s knife arm. At a nod from Paul, he sheathed the blade, got to his feet.\nA sighing whisper of awe passed through the crowd, and Jessica heard the words: “The prophecy— A Bene Gesserit shall show the way and a Reverend Mother shall see it.” And, from farther away: “She shows us through her son!”\n“Stilgar leads this tribe,” Paul said. “Let no man mistake that. He commands with my voice. What he tells you, it is as though | told you.”\nWise, Jessica thought. The tribal commander must lose no face among those who should obey him.\nPaul lowered his voice, said: “Stilgar, | want sandwalkers out this night and cielagos sent to summon a Council Gathering. When you've sent them, bring Chatt,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6a1f52dd276aea57f7275a8d759e1bbf143b1b115fc3949291301a0557d7db26_v2"}
