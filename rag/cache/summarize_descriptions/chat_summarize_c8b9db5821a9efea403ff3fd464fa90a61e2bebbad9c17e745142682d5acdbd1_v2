The LAZA TIGERS actively hunt LETO, posing a direct and immediate threat to his survival. Despite the danger, LETO demonstrates remarkable bravery by defending himself against their attacks. However, after being assaulted by the LAZA TIGERS, LETO is forced to retreat and seek refuge in Jacurutu, a decision driven by the need for safety. This series of events highlights the intense adversarial relationship between LETO and the LAZA TIGERS, underscoring both the physical danger they represent and LETO's resilience in the face of such threats.
