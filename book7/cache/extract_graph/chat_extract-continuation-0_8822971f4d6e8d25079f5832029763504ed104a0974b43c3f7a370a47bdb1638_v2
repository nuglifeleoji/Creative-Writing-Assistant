设计考卷时，教务主任特地叮嘱石神，千万别出太难的题目。\n    “其实我也不想这样说，不过老实说补考只是个形式，只是为了不要让学生带着红字升级。我想石神老师你也不想再这么麻烦吧。大家老\n\n早就在抱怨石神老师的考题难了，二次补考时就拜托您，让所有的人都能一举及格。”\n    对石神而言，他觉得自己出的考题并不难，甚至可以说简单了。考题并没有超出课堂上教授的范围，只要了解基本原则，应该立刻就能解\n\n答。只不过，要稍微换个角度着眼。这种变化方式，和参考书或考题集锦常见的题目不太一样，学生若是只有死背解法顺序自然无所适从。\n    不过这次他遵照了教务主任的指示，从现成的考题集锦，选出最具代表性的题目照抄不误，只要普通做了练习应该都解得出来。\n    森冈打了一个打哈欠，看着时钟。石神朝他一看，当下四目相对。本以为森冈会觉得尴尬，没想到他夸张地皱起眉头，双手比出一个大叉\n\n，好像想说：我其实不会作答。\n    石神看他这样，朝他咧嘴一笑。森冈看了露出有点惊讶的表情，然后同样也咧嘴一笑，又开始望着窗外。\n    微积分这玩意到底能派上什么用场嘛――石神想起森冈以前问的这个问题。虽然当时他用摩托车赛举例，解释过必要性，不过难保森冈听\n\n懂了几分。\n    然而石神并不排斥森冈这种质疑的态度，对于为何要学习某种东西抱有疑问，是理所当然的。唯有当这个疑问解除了，才会产生求学的目的，也才能通往理解数学本质之路。\n    可惜太多老师都不愿回答学生这种单纯的疑问，不，应该是答不出来吧，石神想。因为他们并不真正地理解数学，只是按照既定的课程照\n\n本宣科，只想着要请学生拿到一定的分数，所以对森冈提出的这种质疑只会觉得不耐烦。\n    自己究竟在这种地方做什么呢？石神想。他正在让学生接受与数学本质无关、纯粹只为了拿分数的考试。无论是打分数，或是藉此决定及\n\n格与否，都毫无意义。这种做法根本无关数学，当然亦非教育。\n    石神站起来，做了一个深呼吸。\n    “全部的人都不用再写了。”他环视着教室说，“剩下的时间，请你们在考卷背面，写上自己现在的想法。”\n    学生们的脸上浮现困惑，教室里一片窃窃私语。他听到有人在嘀咕：什么叫自己的想法？\n    “就是自己对数学的感受。只要和数学有关，写什么都行。”他又补上一句：“这个内容也列入计分。”\n    学生们的�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
