，她还对他说过，希望他千万不能变成个世俗的农民，满嘴说的都是吃，肩膀上搭着个褡裢，在石圪节街上瞅着买个便宜猪娃……为此，在少平回村的那两年里，她不断给他奇书和《参考消息》，并竭力提示他不要丧失远大理想……后来，她才渐渐认识到，实际生活是冷酷的；因为种种原因，这些不能进入大学门，又进入不了公家门的农村青年，即是性格非凡，天赋很高，到头来仍然会被环境所征服。当然，不是说农村就一定干不出什么名堂；主要是精神境界很可能被小农意识的汪洋大海所淹没……尽管田晓霞如此推断了孙少平未来的命运，但出于中学时期深切的友谊，上大学后，她还不准备断绝和少平的联系。只是她一年前写信给他以后，他再没有给她回信，她这才在遗憾之中似乎也感到了某种解脱。她一生不会忘记这个少年时期的朋友；但她知道，她也许在今后的岁月中甚至不会再和他相遇，充其量只是在记忆中留下深刻印象的往日的朋友…… \n　　可是，她今天无意中在黄原街头碰见了他。 \n　　莎士比亚是她崇拜和敬仰的作家，根据《哈姆雷特》改编的电影《王子复仇记》在黄原放映第一场，她就去看了。看了一遍还不过瘾，碰巧今天有一张票，她就准备再看第二场……结果，便在人丛中发现了蓬头垢面、一身褴褛的孙少平。从把他引到父亲的办公室到刚才送走他，几个小时中，她都震惊得有些恍惚，如同电影中哈姆雷特看见了父亲的鬼魂…… \n　　现在，她一个人漫游在夜晚的黄原街头，细细思索着孙少平这个人和他的道路。她从他的谈吐中，知道这已经是一个对生活有了独特理解的人。 \n　　是的，他在我们的时代属于这样的青年：有文化，但没有幸运地进入大学或参加工作，因此似乎没有充分的条件直接参与到目前社会发展的主潮之中。而另一方面，他们又不甘心把自己局限在狭小的生活天地里。因此，他们往往带着一种悲壮的激情，在一条最为艰难的道路上进行人生的搏斗。他们顾不得高谈阔论或愤世嫉俗地忧患人类的命运。他们首先得改变自己的生存条件，同时也放弃最主要的精神追求；他们既不鄙视普通人的世俗生活，但又竭力使自己对生活的认识达到更深的层次……在田晓霞的眼里，孙少平一下子变成了一个她十分饮佩的人物。过去，都是她“教导”他，现在，他倒给她带来了许多对生活新鲜的看法和理解。尽管生活逼迫他走了这样一条艰苦的道路，但这却是很不平凡的。她马上为在自己的生活中有这\n######################\nOutput:",
