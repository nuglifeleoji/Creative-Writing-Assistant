既新歌在天罗城宣布之后，在紫萝城，乐公子竟然又来了新花样，这简直都有些不像他了啊！\n\n    “我……”一个女孩儿已经激动的跳了起来。\n\n    刹那间，几乎所有歌迷都沸腾了，尤其是女歌迷们。\n\n    乐公子要演唱的，可是《守护时光守护你》啊！请人配合，岂不是要对这她来演唱吗？这是何等美妙的事情？\n\n    这简直了，简直是巨大的福利啊！肯对女粉丝演唱的乐公子，那简直就是活神仙啊！\n\n    一时间，全场沸腾。\n\n    后台的乐卿灵都惊呆了。因为，这也不是事先安排好的啊！主办方也同样是如此。\n\n    庄子建几乎是第一时间就冲到了乐卿灵面前，“乐经纪人，怎么事先没告诉我们？这是可以大做文章的啊！你们经纪公司这么专业，怎么会错过这样的好机会啊？这究竟是什么情况？下回能不能先告诉我们一下，让我们提前做好准备。这个名额甚至是可以用来拍卖的。以乐公子现在的人气，一定可以拍出天价，要是再把拍卖所得捐赠出去做慈善，对乐公子的口碑也是大有好处的啊！”\n\n    乐卿灵嘴角有些抽搐，扭头看向庄子建，“庄总，我要跟您说，乐公子现在在台上突发奇想，我根本就不知道，您信不信？”\n\n    庄子建的嘴角也抽了，“这……、这个……，好吧，随他吧，反正观众们喜欢就行。乐经纪人，跟你们一起办活动，真是让我的心脏有点受不了啊！幸好今天不是突然脱离。”\n\n    乐卿灵也笑了，“庄总，你信不信，现在歌迷们巴不得他离开现场呢。那样的话，说不定就又会带回来一首新歌。”\n\n    庄子建赶忙摆手，“别、别。我怕死。我的心脏真的受不了了，那天我回去差点心肌梗死。我一把年纪，太刺激受不了啊！不能跟你们年轻人比啊！”\n\n    “那么，下面我来选一位观众。”乐公子的声音再次响起，“请大家安静一下，谢谢。”\n------------\n\n第七十七章

乐公子的眸光缓缓朝着台下扫去，扫向哪一边，哪一边就会传来一片嘈杂的声音。一条条手臂举得高高的，唯恐乐公子看不到自己。\n\n    南澄的心同样很紧张，而且还带着几分期盼，她可是记得，先前乐公子的目光\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
