That is difficult.”\nLucilla had expected that response and, what was more, she could see he knew it.\n“There is a Guild Navigator on Gammu helping the search for you,” he said. “It is one of the Edrics, very powerful, | am told.”\n“I have Siona blood. He cannot see me.”\n“Nor me nor any of my people and for the same reason. We Jews adjust to many necessities, you know.”\n“This Edric is a gesture,” she said. “He can do little.”\n“But they have brought him. I’m afraid there is no way we can get you Safely off the planet.”\n“Then what can we do?”\n“We will see. My people are not entirely helpless, you understand?”\nShe recognized sincerity and concern for her. He spoke quietly of resisting the sexual blandishments of Honored Matres, “doing it unobtrusively so as not to arouse them.”\n“I will go whisper in a few ears,” he said.\nShe felt oddly restored by this. There often was something coldly remote and cruel about falling into the hands of the medical professions. She reassured herself with the knowledge that Suks were conditioned to be alert to your needs, compassionate and supportive. (All of those things that can fall by the wayside in emergencies.)\nShe bent her efforts to restoring calm, focusing on the personal mantra she had gained in solo death education.\nIfl am to die, | must pass along a transcendental lesson. | must leave with serenity.\nThat helped but still she felt a trembling. The Rabbi had been gone too long. Something was wrong.\nWas I right to trust him?\nDespite a growing sense of doom, Lucilla forced herself to practice Bene Gesserit naivete as she reviewed her encounter with the Rabbi. Her Proctors had called this “the innocence that goes naturally with inexperience, a condition often confused with ignorance.” Into this naivete all things flowed. It was close to Mentat performance. Information entered without prejudgment. “You are a mirror upon which the universe is reflected. That reflection is all you experience. Images bounce from your senses. Hypotheses arise. Important even when wrong. Here is the exceptional case where more than one wrong can produce dependable decisions.”\n“We are your willing servants,” the Rabbi had said.\nThat was guaranteed to alert a Reverend Mother.\nThe explanations of Odrade’s crystal felt suddenly inadequate. /t’s almost always profit. She accepted this as cynical but from vast experience. Attempts to weed it out of human behavior always broke up on the rocks of application. Socializing and communistic systems only changed the counters that measured profits. Enormous managerial bureaucracies—the counter was power.\nLucilla warned herself that the manifestations were always the same. Look at this Rabbi’s extensive farm!\nRetirement retreat for a Suk? She had seen something of what lay behind the establishment: servants, richer quarters. And there must be more. No matter the system it was always the same: the best foods, beautiful lovers, unrestricted travel, magnificent holiday accommodations.\nIt gets very tiresome when you've seen it as often as we have.\nShe knew her mind was jittering but felt powerless to prevent it. Survival. The very bottom of the demand system is always survival. And I threaten the survival of the Rabbi and his people.\nHe had fawned upon her. A/ways beware of those who fawn upon us, nuzzling up to all of that power we're supposed to have. How flattering to find great mobs of servants waiting and anxious to do our bidding! How utterly debilitating.\nThe mistake of Honored Matres.\nWhat is delaying the Rabbi?\nWas he seeing how much he could get for the Reverend Mother Lucilla?\nA door slammed below her, shaking the floor under her feet. She heard hurried footsteps on a stairway. How primitive these people were. Stairways! Lucilla turned as the door opened. The Rabbi entered bringing a rich smell of melange. He stood by the door assessing her mood.\n“Forgive my tardiness, dear lady. | was summoned for questioning by Edric, the Guild Navigator.”\nThat explained the smell of spice. Navigators were forever bathed in the orange gas of melange, their features often fogged by the vapors. Lucilla could visualize the Navigator’s tiny v of a mouth and the ugly flap of nose. Mouth and nose appeared small on a Navigator’s gigantic face with its pulsing temples. She knew how threatened the Rabbi must have felt listening to the singsong ululations of the Navigator’s voice with its simultaneous mechtranslation into impersonal Galach.\n“What did he want?”\n“You.”\n“Does he...”\n“He does not know for sure but | am certain he suspects us. However, he suspects everybody.”\n“Did they follow you?”\n“Not necessary. They can find me any time they want.”\n“What shall we do?” She knew she spoke too fast, much too loud.\n“Dear lady .. .” He came three steps closer and she saw the perspiration on his forehead and nose. Fear. She could smell it.\n“Well, what is it?”\n“The economic view behind the activities of Honored Matres—we find them quite interesting.”\nHis words crystallized her fears. / knew it! He’s selling me out!\n“As you Reverend Mothers know very well, there are always gaps in economic systems.”\n“Yes?” Profoundly wary.\n“Incomplete suppression of trade in any commodity always increases the profits of the tradesmen, especially the profits of the senior distributors.” His voice was warningly hesitant. “That is the fallacy of thinking you can control unwanted narcotics by stopping them at your borders.”\nWhat was he trying to tell her? His words described elementary facts known even to acolytes. Increased profits were always used to buy safe paths past border guards, often by buying the guards themselves.\nHas he bought servants of the Honoted Matres? Surely, he doesn’t believe he can do that safely.\nShe waited while he composed his thoughts, obviously forming a presentation he believed most likely to gain her acceptance.\nWhy did he point her attention toward border guards? That certainly was what he had done. Guards always had a\nready rationalization for betraying their superiors, of course. “If | don’t, someone else will.”\nShe dared to hope.\nThe Rabbi cleared his throat. It was apparent he had found the words he wanted and had placed them in order.\n“I do not believe there is any way to get you off Gammu alive.”\nShe had not expected such a blunt condemnation. “But the...”\n“The information you carry, that is a different matter,” he said.\nSo that was behind all of the focusing on borders and guards!\n“You don’t understand, Rabbi. My information is not just a few words and some warnings.” She tapped a finger against her forehead. “In here are many precious lives, all of those irreplaceable experiences, learning so vital that—”\n“Ahhh, but | do understand, dear lady. Our problem is that you do not understand.”\nAlways these references to understanding!\n“It is your honor upon which I depend at this moment,” he said.\nAhhhh, the legendary honesty and trustworthiness of the Bene Gesserit when we have given our word!\n“You know | will die rather than betray you,” she said.\nHe spread his hands wide in a rather helpless gesture. “l am fully confident of that, dear lady. The question is not one of betrayal but of something we have never before revealed to your Sisterhood.”\n“What are you trying to tell me?” Quite peremptory, almost with Voice (which she had been warned not to try on these Jews).\n“I must exact a promise from you. | must have your word that you will not turn against us because of what | am about to reveal. You must promise to accept my solution to our dilemma.”\n“Sight unseen?”\n“Only because | ask it of you and assure you that we honor our commitment to your Sisterhood.”\nShe glared at him, trying to see through this barrier he had erected between them. His surface reactions could be read but not the mysterious thing beneath his unexpected behavior.\nThe Rabbi waited for this fearsome woman to reach her decision. Reverend Mothers always made him uneasy. He knew what her decision must be and pitied her. He saw that she could read the pity in his expression. They knew so much and so little. Their powers were manifest. And their knowledge of Secret Israel so perilous!\nWe owe them this debt, though. She is not of the Chosen, but a debt is a debt. Honor is honor. Truth is truth.\nThe Bene Gesserit had preserved Secret Israel in many hours of need. And a pogrom was something his people knew without lengthy explanations. Pogrom was embedded in the psyche of Secret Israel. And thanks to the Unspeakable, the chosen people would never forget. No more than they could forgive.\nMemory kept fresh in daily ritual (with periodic emphasis in communal sharings) cast a glowing halo on what the Rabbi knew he must do. And this poor woman! She, too, was trapped by memories and circumstances.\nInto the cauldron! Both of us!\n“You have my word,” Lucilla said.\nThe Rabbi returned to the room’s only door and opened it. An older woman in a long brown gown stood there. She stepped in at the Rabbi’s beckoning gesture. Hair the color of old driftwood neatly bound in a bun at the back of her head. Face pinched in and wrinkled, dark as a dried almond. The eyes, though! Total blue! And that steely hardness within them...\n“This is Rebecca, one of our people,” the Rabbi said. “As | am sure you can see, she has done a dangerous thing.”\n“The Agony,” Lucilla whispered.\n“She did it long ago and she serves us well. Now, she will serve you.”\nLucilla had to be certain. “Can you Share?”\n“I have never done it, lady, but | know it.” As Rebecca spoke, she approached Lucilla and stopped when they were almost touching.\nThey leaned toward each other until their foreheads made contact. Their hands went out and gripped the offered shoulders.\nAs their minds locked, Lucilla forced a projective thought: “This must get to my Sisters!”\n“| promise, dear lady.”\nThere could be no deception in this total mixing of minds, this ultimate candor powered by imminent and certain death or the poisonous melange essence that ancient Fremen had rightly called “the little death.” Lucilla accepted Rebecca’s promise. This wild Reverend Mother of the Jews committed her life to the assurance. Something else! Lucilla gasped as she saw it. The Rabbi intended to sell her to the Honored Matres. The driver of the produce carrier had been one of their agents come to confirm that there was indeed a woman of Lucilla’s description at the farmhouse.\nRebecca’s candor gave Lucilla no escape: “It is the only way we can Save ourselves and maintain our credibility.”\nSo that was why the Rabbi had made her think of guards and power brokers! Clever, clever. And I accept it as he knew I would.\nYou cannot manipulate a marionette with only one string.\n—THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\nhe Reverend Mother Sheeana stood at her sculpting\nstand, a gray-clawed shaper covering each hand like exotic gloves. The black sensiplaz on the stand had been taking form under her hands for almost an hour. She felt herself close to the creation that sought realization, surging from a wild place within her. The intensity of the creative force made her skin tremble and she wondered that passersby in the hall to her right did not sense it. The north window of her workroom admitted gray light behind her and the western window glowed orange with a desert sunset.\nPrester, Sheeana’s senior assistant here at the Desert Watch Station, had paused in the doorway", " and maintain our credibility.”\nSo that was why the Rabbi had made her think of guards and power brokers! Clever, clever. And I accept it as he knew I would.\nYou cannot manipulate a marionette with only one string.\n—THE ZENSUNNI WHIP\nhe Reverend Mother Sheeana stood at her sculpting\nstand, a gray-clawed shaper covering each hand like exotic gloves. The black sensiplaz on the stand had been taking form under her hands for almost an hour. She felt herself close to the creation that sought realization, surging from a wild place within her. The intensity of the creative force made her skin tremble and she wondered that passersby in the hall to her right did not sense it. The north window of her workroom admitted gray light behind her and the western window glowed orange with a desert sunset.\nPrester, Sheeana’s senior assistant here at the Desert Watch Station, had paused in the doorway a few minutes ago but the entire station complement knew better than to interrupt Sheeana at this work.\nStepping back, Sheeana brushed a strand of sun-streaked brown hair from her forehead with the back of a hand. The black plaz stood in front of her like a challenge, its curves and planes a/most fitted to the form she sensed within her.\nI come here to create when my fears are greatest, she thought.\nThis thought dampened the creative surge and she redoubled her efforts to complete the sculpture. Her shaper- clad hands dipped and swooped over the plaz and black Shape followed each intrusion like a wave driven by an insane wind.\nThe light from the north window faded and the automatics compensated with a yellow-gray glow from the\nceiling edges but it was not the same. It was not the same!\nSheeana stepped back from her work. Close ... but not close enough. She could almost touch the form within her and feel it striving for birth. But the plaz was not right. One sweeping stroke of her right hand reduced it to a black blob on the stand.\nDamn!\nShe stripped off the shapers and dropped them to the shelf beside the sculpting stand. The horizon out the western window still carried a strip of orange. Fading fast the way she felt the fading of her creative surge.\nStriding to the sunset window, she was in time to see the last of the day’s search teams return. Their landing lights were firefly darts off to the south where a temporary flat had been established in the path of the advancing dunes. She could see from the slow way the ‘thopters came down that they had found no spiceblows or other signs that Sandworms were at last developing from the sandtrout planted here.\nl am shepherd to worms that may never come.\nThe window gave back to her a dark reflection of her features. She could see where the Spice Agony had left its marks. The slender, brown-skinned waif of Dune had become a tall, rather austere woman. But her brown hair still insisted on escaping the tight coif at the nape of her neck. And she could see the wildness in her all-blue eyes. Others could see it, too. And that was the problem, source of some of her fears.\nThere appeared to be no stopping the Missionaria in its preparations for our Sheeana.\nIf the giant sandworms developed—Shai-hulud returned! And the Missionaria Protectiva of the Bene Gesserit was ready to launch her onto an unsuspecting humanity prepared for religious adoration. The myth become real... just the way she tried to make that sculpture back there a reality.\nHoly Sheeana! The God Emperor is her thrall! See how the sacred sandworms obey her! Leto is returned!\nWould it influence the Honored Matres? Probably. They gave at least lip service to the God Emperor in his name of Guldur.\nNot likely they would follow “Holy Sheeana’s” lead except in the matter of sexual exploits. Sheeana knew her own sexual behavior, outrageous even by Bene Gesserit standards, was a form of protest against this role the Missionaria tried to impose on her. The excuse that she only polished the males trained in sexual bondage by Duncan Idaho was just that... an excuse.\nBellonda suspects.\nMentat Bell was a constant danger to Sisters who got out of line. And that was a major reason Bell held her powerful position in the high Council of the Sisterhood.\nSheeana turned away from the window and flung herself onto the orange and umber spread covering her cot. Directly in front of her, a large black and white drawing of a giant worm poised above a tiny human figure.\nThat’s the way they were and may never be again. What was | trying to say with that drawing? If | knew I might be able to complete the plaz sculpture.\nIt had been perilous to develop a secret hand-talk with Duncan. But there were things the Sisterhood could not know—not yet.\nThere might be a way of escape for both of us.\nBut where could they go? It was a universe beset by Honored Matres and other forces. It was a universe of scattered planets peopled mostly by humans who wanted only to live out their lives in peace—accepting Bene Gesserit guidance in some places, squirming under Honored Matre Suppression in many regions, mostly hoping to govern themselves as best they could, the perennial dream of democracy, and then there were always the unknowns. And always the lesson of the Honored Matres! Murbella’s clues\nsaid Fish Speakers and Reverend Mothers in extremis formed the Honored Matres. Fish Speaker democracy become Honored Matre autocracy! The clues were too numerous to ignore. But why had they emphasized unconscious compulsions with their T-probes, cellular induction, and sexual prowess?\nWhere is the market to accept our fugitive talents?\nThis universe no longer possessed a single bourse. A species of subterranean webworks could be defined. It was extremely loose, based on old compromises and temporary agreements.\nOdrade had once said: “It resembles an old garment with frayed edges and patched holes.”\nCHOAM'’s tightly bound trading network of the Old Empire was no more. Now, it was fearful bits and pieces held together by the loosest of ties. People treated this patched thing with contempt, longing always for the good old days.\nWhat kind of a universe would accept us merely as fugitives and not as the Sacred Sheeana with her consort?\nNot that Duncan was a consort. That had been the Bene Gesserit’s original plan: “Bond Sheeana to Duncan. We control him and he can control her.”\nMurbella cut that plan short. And a good thing for both of us. Who needs a sexual obsession? But Sheeana was forced to admit she harbored oddly confused feelings about Duncan Idaho. The hand-talks, the touching. And what could they say to Odrade when she came prying? Not if, but when.\n“We talk about ways for Duncan and Murbella to escape you, Mother Superior. We talk about other ways to restore Teg’s memories. We talk about our own private rebellion against the Bene Gesserit. Yes, Darwi Odrade! Your former student has become a rebel against you.”\nSheeana admitted to mixed feelings about Murbella as well.\nShe domesticated Duncan where | might have failed.\nThe captive Honored Matre was a fascinating study... and amusing at times. There was her joking doggerel posted on the wall of the ship’s Acolyte dining room.\nHey, God! | hope you're there.\n| want you to hear my prayer. That graven image on my shelf; Is it really you or just myself? Well, anyway, here it goes: Please keep me on my toes. Help me past my worst mistakes, Doing it for both our sakes,\nFor an example of perfection\nTo the Proctors of my section;\nOr merely for the Heaven of it, Like bread, for the leaven of it. For whatever reason may incline, Please act for yours and mine.\nThe subsequent confrontation with Odrade, caught by the comeyes, had been a beautiful thing to watch. Odrade’s voice oddly strident: “Murbella? You?”\n“I’m afraid so.” No contrition in her at all.\n“Afraid so?” Still strident.\n“Why not?” Quite defiant.\n“You joke about the Missionaria! Don’t protest. That was your intent.”\n“They’re so damned pretentious!”\nSheeana could only sympathize as she reflected on that confrontation. Rebellious Murbella was a symptom. What ferments until you are forced to notice it?\n| fought in just that way against the everlasting discipline, “which will make you strong, child.”\nWhat was Murbella like as a child? What pressures shaped her? Life was always a reaction to pressures. Some gave in to easy distractions and were shaped by them: pores bloated and reddened by excesses. Bacchus leering at them. Lust fixing its shape on their features. A Reverend Mother knew it by millennial observation. We are shaped by\npressures whether we resist them or not. Pressures and shapings—that was life. And I create new pressures by my secret defiance.\nGiven the Sisterhood’s present state of alertness to all threats, the hand-talk with Duncan probably was futile.\nSheeana tipped her head and looked at the black blob on the sculpting stand.\nBut I will persist. | will create my own statement of my life. | will create my own life! Damn the Bene Gesserit!\nAnd I will lose the respect of my Sisters.\nThere was something antique about the way respectful conformity was forced upon them. They had preserved this thing from their most ancient past, taking it out regularly to polish and make the necessary repairs that time required of all human creations. And here it was today, held in unspoken reverence.\nThus you are a Reverend Mother and by no other Judgment shall that be true.\nSheeana knew then she would be forced to test that antique thing to its limits, probably breaking it. And that black plaz form seeking outlet from the wild place within her was only one element of what she knew she had to do. Call it rebellion, call it by any other name, the force she felt in her breast could not be denied.\nConfine yourself to observing and you always miss the point of your own life. The object can be stated this way: Live the best life you can. Life is a game whose rules you learn if you leap into it and play it to the hilt. Otherwise, you are caught off balance, continually surprised by the shifting play. Non-players often whine and complain that luck always passes them by. They refuse to see that they can create some of their own luck.\n—DARWI ODRADE\nfd H ave you studied the latest comeye record of Idaho?” Bellonda asked.\n“Later! Later!” Odrade knew she was feeling peckish and it had come out in the response to Bell’s pertinent question. Pressures confined the Mother Superior more and more these days. She had always tried to face her duties with an\nattitude of broad interest. The more things to interest her, the wider her scan and that was sure to bring more usable data. Using the senses improved them. Substance, that was what her questing interests desired. Substance. It was like hunting for food to assuage a deep hunger.\nBut her days were becoming duplicates of this morning. Her liking for personal inspections was well known but these workroom walls held her. She must be where she could be reached. Not only reached, but able to dispatch communications and people on the instant.\nDamn! I will make the time. | must!\nIt was time pressure as much as anything.\nSheeana said: “We trundle along on borrowed days.”\n", " Bellonda asked.\n“Later!

I will make the time. | must!\nIt was time pressure as much as anything.\nSheeana said: “We trundle along on borrowed days.”\nVery poetic! Not much help in the face of pragmatic demands. They had to get as many Bene Gesserit cells as possible Scattered before the axe fell. Nothing else had that\npriority. The Bene Gesserit fabric was being torn apart, sent to destinations no one on Chapterhouse could know. Sometimes, Odrade saw this flow as rags and remnants. They went flapping away in their no-ships, a stock of sandtrout in their holds, Bene Gesserit traditions, learning and memories as guide. But the Sisterhood had done this long ago in the first Scattering and none came back or sent a message. Not one. Not one. Only Honored Matres returned. If they had ever been Bene Gesserit, they now were a terrible distortion, blindly suicidal.\nWill we ever be whole again?\nOdrade looked down at the work on her table: more selection charts. Who shall go and who shall remain? There was little time to pause and take a deep breath. Other Memory from her late predecessor, Taraza, took on an “I told you so!” character. “See what | had to go through?”\nAnd I once wondered if there was room at the top.\nThere might be room at the top (as she was fond of telling acolytes) but there was seldom enough time.\nWhen she thought of the largely passive non-Bene Gesserit populace “out there,” Odrade sometimes envied them. They were permitted their illusions. What a comfort. You could pretend your life was forever, that tomorrow would be better, that the gods in their heavens watched you with care.\nShe recoiled from this lapse with disgust at herself. The unclouded eye was better, no matter what it saw.\n“I’ve studied the latest Idaho records,” she said, looking across the table at the patient Bellonda.\n“He has interesting instincts,” Bellonda said.\nOdrade thought about that. Comeyes throughout the no- ship missed little. The Council’s theory about ghola-Ildaho became daily less a theory and more a conviction. How many memories from the serial Idaho lifetimes did this ghola contain?\n“Tam is raising doubts about their children,” Bellonda said. “Do they have dangerous talents?”\nThat was to be expected. The three children Murbella had borne Idaho in the no-ship had been removed at birth. All were being observed with care as they developed. Did they have that uncanny reactive speed Honored Matres displayed? Too early to say. It was a thing that developed in puberty, according to Murbella.\nTheir captive Honored Matre accepted the removal of her children with angry resignation. Idaho, however, showed little reaction. Odd. Did something give him a broader view of procreation? Almost a Bene Gesserit view?\n“Another Bene Gesserit breeding program,” he sneered.\nOdrade let her thoughts flow. Was it really the Bene Gesserit attitude they saw in Idaho? The Sisterhood said emotional attachments were ancient detritus—important for human survival in their day but no longer required in the Bene Gesserit plan.\nInstincts.\nThings that came with egg and sperm. Often vital and loud: “This is the species talking to you, dolt!”\nLoves... offspring... hungers... All of those unconscious motives to compel specific behavior. It was dangerous to meddle in such matters. The Breeding Mistresses knew this even while they did it. The Council debated it periodically and ordered a careful watch on consequences.\n“You’ve studied the records. Is that all the answer | get?” Quite plaintive for Bellonda.\nThe comeye record of such interest to Bell was of Idaho questioning Murbella about Honored Matre sexual-addiction techniques. Why? His parellel abilities came from Tleilaxu conditioning impressed on his cells in the axlotl tank. Idaho’s abilities originated as an unconscious pattern akin to instincts but the result was indistinguishable from the\nHonored Matre effect: ecstasy amplified until it drove out all reason and bound its victims to the source of such rewards. Murbella went only so far in a verbal exploration of her abilities. Obvious residual fury that Idaho had addicted her\nwith the same techniques she had been taught to use.\n“Murbella blocks up when Idaho questions motives,” Bellonda said.\nYes, I’ve seen that.\n“I could kill you and you know it!” Murbella had said.\nThe comeye record showed them in bed in Murbella’s no- ship quarters, having just satiated their mutual addiction. Sweat glistened on bare flesh. Murbella lay with a blue towel across her forehead, green eyes staring up at the comeyes. She appeared to be looking directly at the observers. Little orange flecks in her eyes. Anger flecks from her body’s residual store of the spice substitute Honored Matres employed. She was on melange now—and no adverse symptoms.\nIdaho lay beside her, black hair in disarray around his face, a sharp contrast to the white pillow beneath his head. His eyes were closed but the lids flickered. Thin. He wasn’t eating enough despite tempting dishes sent by Odrade’s own chef. His high cheekbones were strongly defined. The face had become craggy in the years of his confinement.\nMurbella’s threat was backed by physical ability, Odrade knew, but it was psychologically false. Ki// her lover? Not likely!\nBellonda was thinking along these same lines. “What was she doing when she demonstrated her physical speed? We've seen that before.”\n“She knows we watch.”\nThe comeyes showed Murbella defying post-coital fatigue to leap from bed. Moving with blurred speed (much faster than anything the Bene Gesserit had ever achieved), she kicked out with her right foot, stopping the blow only a hair’s breadth from Idaho’s head.\nAt her first movement, Idaho opened his eyes. He watched without fear, without flinching.\nThat blow! Fatal if it struck. You had only to see sucha thing once to fear it. Murbella moved with no resort to her central cortex. Insect-like, an attack triggered by nerves at the point of muscle ignition.\n“You see!” Murbella lowered her foot and glared down at him.\nIdaho smiled.\nWatching it, Odrade reminded herself that the Sisterhood had three of Murbella’s children, all female. The Breeding Mistresses were excited. In time, Reverend Mothers born of this line might match that Honored Matre ability.\nIn time we probably don’t have.\nBut Odrade shared the excitement of the Breeding Mistresses. That speed! Add that to the nerve-muscle training, the great pranabindu resources of the Sisterhood! What that might create lay wordlessly within her.\n“She did that for us, not for him,” Bellonda said.\nOdrade was not sure. Murbella resented the constant watch over her but she had come to an accommodation with it. Many of her actions obviously ignored the people behind the comeyes. This record showed her returning to her place in the bed beside Idaho.\n“I have restricted access to that record,” Bellonda said. “Some acolytes are becoming troubled.”\nOdrade nodded. Sexual addiction. That aspect of Honored Matre abilities created disturbing ripples in the Bene Gesserit, especially among acolytes. Very suggestive. And most of the Sisters on Chapterhouse knew the Reverend Mother Sheeana, alone among them, practiced some of these techniques in defiance of a general fear this could weaken them.\n“We must not become Honored Matres!” Bell was always saying that. But Sheeana represents a significant control factor. She teaches us something about Murbella.\nOne afternoon, catching Murbella alone in her no-ship quarters and obviously relaxed, Odrade had tried a direct question. “Before Idaho, were none of you ever tempted to, let us Say, ‘join in the fun’?”\nMurbella had recoiled with angry pride. “He caught me by accident!”\nThe same kind of anger she showed to Idaho’s questions. Remembering this, Odrade leaned over her worktable and called up the original record.\n“Look at how angry she gets,” Bellonda said. “A hypnotrance injunction against answering such questions. I'd stake my reputation on it.”\n“That'll come out in the Spice Agony,” Odrade said.\n“If she ever gets to it!”\n“Hypnotrance is supposed to be our secret.”\nBellonda chewed on the obvious inference. No Sister we sent out in the original Scattering ever returned.\nIt was written large in their minds: “Did renegade Bene Gesserit create the Honored Matres?” Much suggested it. Then why did they resort to sexual enslavement of males? Murbella’s historical prattlings did not satisfy. Everything about this went against Bene Gesserit teaching.\n“We have to learn,” Bellonda insisted. “What little we know is very disturbing.”\nOdrade recognized the concern. How much of a lure was this ability? Very big, she thought. Acolytes complained that they dreamed about becoming Honored Matres. Bellonda was rightly worried.\nCreate or arouse such unbridled forces and you built carnal fantasies of enormous complexity. You could lead whole populations around by their desires, by their fantasy projections.\nThere was the terrible power the Honored Matres dared use. Let it be known that they had the key to blinding ecstasy and they had won half the battle. The simple clue that such a thing existed, that was the beginning of\nsurrender. People at Murbella’s level in that other Sisterhood might not understand this but the ones at the top... Was it possible they merely used this power without caring or even suspecting its deeper force? /f that were the case, how were our first Scattered Ones lured into this dead end?\nEarlier, Bellonda had offered her hypothesis:\nHonored Matre with captive Reverend Mother taken prisoner in that first Scattering. “Welcome, Reverend Mother. We would like you to witness a small demonstration of our powers.” Interlude of sexual demonstration followed by a display of Honred Matre physical speed. Then— withdrawal of melange and injection of the adrenaline-based substitute laced with a hypnodrug. In that hypothetical trance, the Reverend Mother was sexually imprinted.\nThat coupled to the selective agony of melange withdrawal (Bell suggested) might make the victim deny her Origins.\nFates help us! Were the original Honored Matres all Reverend Mothers? Do we dare test this hypothesis on ourselves? What can we learn of this from that pair in the no-ship?\nTwo sources of information lay there under the Sisterhood’s watchful eyes but the key had yet to be found.\nWoman and man no longer just breeding partners, no longer a comfort and support to each other. Something new has been added. The stakes have been escalated.\nIn the comeye record playing at the work"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_9849e122b7fd9629ee015c2df1c5e895b33ebf634c3c798c865e84f051f80276_v2"}
