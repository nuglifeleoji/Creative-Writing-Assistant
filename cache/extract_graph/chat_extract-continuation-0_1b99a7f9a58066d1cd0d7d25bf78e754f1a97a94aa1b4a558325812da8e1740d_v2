Only the familiar sounds of maintenance activities penetrated her private chambers. Two glowglobes hovered over her table, bathing the dark wood surface and rows of ridulian paper in yellow light. The window beyond her table was a dark mirror reflecting the room.\nArchives!\nThe holoprojector flickered with its continuing production above the tabletop—more bits and pieces that she had summoned.\nTaraza rather distrusted Archivists, which she knew was an ambivalent attitude because she recognized the underlying necessity for data. But Chapter House Records could only be viewed as a jungle of abbreviations, special notations, coded insertions, and footnotes. Such material often required a Mentat for translation or, what was worse, in times of extreme fatigue demanded that she delve into Other Memories. All Archivists were Mentats, of course, but this did not reassure Taraza. You could never consult Archival Records in a straightforward manner. Much of the interpretation that emerged from that source had to be accepted on the word of the ones who brought it or\n(hateful!) you had to rely on the mechanical search by the holosystem. This, in its turn, required a dependency on those who maintained the system. It gave functionaries more power than Taraza cared to delegate.\nDependencies!\nTaraza hated dependency. This was a rueful admission, reminding her that few developing situations were ever precisely what you imagined they would be. Even the best of Mentat projections accumulated errors ... given enough time.\nStill, every move the Sisterhood made required the consultation of Archives and seemingly endless analyses. Even ordinary commerce demanded it. She found this a frequent irritation. Should they form this group? Sign that agreement?\nThere always came the moment during a conference when she was forced to introduce a note of decision:\n“Analysis by Archivist Hesterion accepted.”\nOr, as was often the case: “Archivists’ report rejected; not pertinent.”\nTaraza leaned forward to study the holoprojection: “Possible breeding plan for Subject Waff.”\nShe scanned the numbers, gene plans from the cell sample forwarded by Odrade. Fingernail scrapings seldom produced enough material for a secure analysis but Odrade had done quite well under the cover of setting the man’s broken bones. Taraza shook her head at the data. Offspring would surely be like all the previous ones the Bene Gesserit had attempted with Tleilaxu: The females would be immune to memory probing: males, of course, would be an impenetrable and repellent chaos.\nTaraza sat back and sighed. When it came to breeding records, the monumental cross-referencing assumed staggering proportions. Officially, it was the “College of Ancestral Pertinence,” CAP to the Archivists. Among the Sisters at large, it was Known as the “Stud Record,” which,\nalthough accurate, failed to convey the sense of detail listed under the proper Archival headings. She had asked for Waff’s projections to be carried out into three hundred generations, an easy and rather rapid task, sufficient for all practical purposes. Three-hundred-Gen mainlines (Such as Teg, his collaterals and siblings) had proved themselves dependable for millennia. Instinct told her it would be bootless to waste more time on the Waff projections.\nFatigue welled up in Taraza. She put her head in her hands and rested them for a moment on the table, feeling the coolness of the wood.\nWhat if | am wrong about Rakis?\nOpposition arguments could not be shuffled away into Archival dust. Damn this dependency on computers! The Sisterhood had carried its main lines in computers even back in the Forbidden Days after the Butlerian Jihad’s wild smashing of “the thinking machines.” In these “more enlightened” days, one tended not to question the unconscious motives behind that ancient orgy of destruction.\nSometimes, we make very responsible decisions for unconscious reasons. A conscious search of Archives or Other Memories carries no guarantees.\nTaraza released one of her hands and slapped it against the tabletop. She did not like dealing with the Archivists who came trotting in with answers to her questions. A disdainful lot they were, full of secret jokes. She had heard them comparing their CAP work to stock breeding, to Farm Forms and Animal Racing Authority. Damn their jokes! The right decision now was far more important than they could possibly imagine. Those serving sisters who only obeyed orders did not have Taraza’s responsibilities.\nShe lifted her head and looked across the room at the niche with its bust of Sister Chenoeh, the ancient one who had met and conversed with the Tyrant.\nYou knew, Taraza thought. You were never a Reverend Mother but still you knew. Your reports show it. How did you know to make the right decision?\nOdrade’s request for military assistance required an immediate answer. The time limits were too tight. But with Teg, Lucilla, and the ghola missing, the contingency plan had to be brought into play.\nDamn Teg!\nMore of his unexpected behavior. He could not leave the ghola in jeopardy, of course. Schwangyu’s actions had been predictable.\nWhat had Teg done? Had he gone to ground in Ysai or one of the other major cities on Gammu? No. If that were the case, Teg would have reported by now through one of the secret contacts they had prepared. He possessed a complete list of those contacts and had investigated some of them personally.\nObviously, Teg did not place full trust in the contacts. He had seen something during his inspection tour that he had not passed along through Bellonda.\nBurzmali would have to be called in and briefed, of course. Burzmali was the best, trained by Teg himself; prime candidate for Supreme Bashar. Burzmali must be sent to Gammu.\nI’m playing a hunch, Taraza thought.\nBut if Teg had gone to ground, the trail started on Gammu. The trail could have ended there as well. Yes, Burzmali to Gammu. Rakis must wait. There were certain obvious attractions in this move. It would not alert the Guild. The Tleilaxu and the ones from the Scattering, however, would certainly rise to the bait. If Odrade failed to trap the Tleilaxu ... no, Odrade would not fail. That one had become almost a certainty.\nThe unexpected.\nYou see, Milles? I have learned from you.\nNone of this deflected the opposition within the Sisterhood, though.\nTaraza put both palms flat on her table and pressed hard, as though trying to sense the people out there in Chapter House, the ones who shared Schwangyu’s opinions. Vocal opposition had subsided but that always meant the violence was being readied.\nWhat shall I do?\nThe Mother Superior was supposed to be immune to indecision in a crisis. But the Tleilaxu connection had unbalanced their data. Some of the recommendations for Odrade appeared obvious and already had been transmitted. That much of the plan was plausible and simple.\nTake Waff into the desert far beyond unwanted eyes. Contrive a situation-in-extremis and the consequent religious experience in the old and reliable pattern dictated by the Missionaria Protectiva. Test whether the Tleilaxu were using the ghola process for their own kind of immortality. Odrade was perfectly capable of carrying out that much of the revised plan. It depended heavily on this young woman, Sheeana, though.\nThe worm itself is the unknown.\nTaraza reminded herself that today’s worm was not the original worm of Rakis. Despite Sheeana’s demonstrated command over them, they were unpredictable. As Archives would say, they had no track record. Taraza held little doubt that Odrade had made an accurate deduction about the Rakians and their dances. That was a plus.\nA language.\nBut we do not yet speak it. That was a negative.\nI must make a decision tonight!\nTaraza sent her surface awareness roaming backward along that unbroken line of Mothers Superior, all of those female memories encapsulated within the fragile awareness of herself and two others—Bellonda and Hesterion. It was a\ntortuous track through Other Memories, which she felt too tired to follow. Right at the edge of the track would be observations of Muad’Dib, the Atreides bastard who had Shaken the universe twice—once by dominating the Imperium with his Fremen hordes, and then by spawning the Tyrant.\nIf we are defeated this time it could be the end of us, she thought. We could be swallowed whole by these hell- spawned females from the Scattering.\nAlternatives presented themselves: The female child on Rakis could be passed into the Sisterhood’s core to live out her life somewhere at the end of a no-ship’s flight. An ignominious retreat.\nSo much depended on Teg. Had he failed the Sisterhood at last or had he found an unexpected way to conceal the ghola?\n| must find a way to delay, Taraza thought. We must give Teg time to communicate with us. Odrade will have to drag out the plan on Rakis.\nIt was dangerous but it had to be done.\nStiffly, Taraza lifted herself from her chairdog and went to the darkened window across from her. Chapter House Planet lay in star-shadowed darkness. A refuge: Chapter House Planet. Such planets were not even recipients of names anymore; only numbers somewhere in Archives. This planet had seen fourteen hundred years of Bene Gesserit occupancy but even that must be considered temporary. She thought of the guardian no-ships orbiting overhead: Teg’s own defense system in depth. Still, Chapter House remained vulnerable.\nThe problem had a name: “accidental discovery.”\nIt was an eternal flaw. Out there in the Scattering, humankind expanded exponentially, swarming across unlimited space. The Tyrant’s Golden Path secure at last. Or was it? Surely, the Atreides worm had planned more than the simple survival of the species.\nHe did something to us that we have not yet unearthed— even after all of these millennia. | think | know what he did. My opposition says otherwise.\nIt was never easy for a Reverend Mother to contemplate the bondage they had suffered under Leto II as he whipped his Imperium for thirty-five hundred years along his Golden Path.\nWe stumble when we review those times.\nSeeing her own reflection in the window’s dark plaz, Taraza glared at herself. It was a grim face and the fatigue easily visible.\n| have every right to be tired and grim!\nShe knew that her training had channeled her deliberately into negative patterns. These were her defenses and her strengths. She remained distant in all human relationships, even in the seductions she had performed for the Breeding Mistresses. Taraza was the perpetual devil’s advocate and this had become a dominant force in the entire Sisterhood, a natural consequence of her elevation to Mother Superior. Opposition developed easily in that environment.\nAs the Sufis said: Rot at the core always spreads outward.\nWhat they did not say was that some rots were noble and valuable.\nShe reassured herself now with her more dependable data: The Scattering took the Tyrant’s lessons outward in the human migrations, changed in unknown ways but ultimately submissive to recognition. And in time, a way would be found to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility. Taraza did not think the people of the Scattering had found this—at least not the ones skulking back into the places that had Spawned them.\nThere was absolutely no safe course through the conflicting forces, but she thought the Sisterhood had armed itself as well as it could. The problem was akin to that of a\nGuild navigator threading his ship through the folds of space in a way that avoided collisions and entrapments.\nEntrapments, they were the key, and there was Odrade springing the Sisterhood’s traps on the Tleilaxu.\nWhen Taraza\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, responsible for making critical decisions and consulting Archives for analysis.
