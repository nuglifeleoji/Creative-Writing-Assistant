What was a healthy mind, anyway?\n“Mother Superior?”\nThat damned Communications acolyte again!\n“Yes?”\n“Bellonda says to tell you immediately there has been a messenger from Buzzell. Strangers came and took all of the Reverend Mothers away.”\nOdrade whirled. “Her entire message?”\n“No, Mother Superior. The strangers are described as commanded by a woman. The messenger says she had the look of an Honored Matre but was not wearing one of their robes.”\n“Nothing from Dortujla or the others?”\n“They were not given the opportunity, Mother Superior. The messenger is a First-Stage acolyte. She came in the Small no-ship following explicit orders from Dortujla.”\n“Tell Bell that acolyte must not be allowed to leave. She has dangerous information. | will brief a messenger when | return. It must be a Reverend Mother. Do you have that?”\n“Of course, Mother Superior.” Hurt at the suggestion of doubt.\nIt was happening! Odrade contained her excitement with difficulty.\nThey have taken the bait. Now... are they on the hook?\nDortujla did a dangerous thing depending on an acolyte that way. Knowing Dortujla, that must be an extremely reliable acolyte. Prepared to kill herself if captured. | must see this acolyte. She may be ready for the Agony. And perhaps that’s a message Dortujla sends me. It would be like her.\nBell would be incensed, of course. Foolish to depend on someone from a punishment station!\nOdrade summoned a Communications team. “Set up a link with Bellonda.”\nThe portable projector was not as clear as a fixed installation but Bell and her setting were recognizable.\nSitting at my table as though she owned it. Excellent!\nNot giving Bellonda time for one of her outbursts, Odrade said: “Determine if that messenger acolyte is ready for the Agony.”\n“She is.” Gods below! That was terse for Bell.\n“Then see to it. Perhaps she can be our messenger.”\n“Already have.”\n“Is she resourceful?”\n“Very.”\nWhat in the name of all the devils has happened to Bell? She’s acting extremely odd. Not like her usual self at all. Duncan!\n“Oh, and Bell, | want Duncan to have an open link with Archives.”\n“Did that this morning.”\nWell, well. Contact with Duncan Is having its effect.\n“lII talk to you after I’ve seen Sheeana.”\n“Tell Tam she was right.”\n“About what?”\n“Just tell her.”\n“Very well. | must say, Bell, | couldn’t be more satisfied with the way you’re handling matters.”\n“After the way you've handled me, how could | fail?”\nBellonda was actually smiling as they broke the connection. Odrade turned to find Tamalane standing behind her.\n“Right about what, Tam?”\n“That there’s more to contacts between Idaho and Sheeana than we’ve suspected.” Tamalane moved close to Odrade and lowered her voice. “Don’t put her in my chair without discovering what they keep secret.”\n“I’m aware you knew my intentions, Tam. But... am | that transparent?”\n“In some things, Dar.”\n“I’m fortunate to have you as a friend.”\n“You have other supporters. When the Proctors voted, it was your creativity that worked for you. ‘Inspired’ is the way one of your defenders put it.”\n“Then you know l'Il have Sheeana on the coals quite thoroughly before | make one of my inspired decisions.”\n“Of course.”\nOdrade signaled Communications to remove the projector and went to wait at the edge of the glassy area.\nCreative imagination.\nShe knew the mixed feelings of her associates.\nCreativity!\nAlways dangerous to entrenched power. Always coming up with something new. New things could destroy the grip of authority. Even the Bene Gesserit approached creativity with misgivings. Maintaining an even keel inspired some to shunt boat-rockers aside. That was an element behind Dortujla’s posting. The trouble was that creative ones tended to welcome backwaters. They called it privacy. It had taken quite a force to bring Dortujla out.\nBe well, Dortujla. Be the best bait we ever used.\nThe ‘thopters came then—sixteen of them, pilots showing displeasure at this added assignment after all the trouble they had been through. Moving whole communities!\nIn a fragile mood, Odrade watched the ’thopters settle to the hard-glazed surface, wing fans folding back into pod sleeves—each craft like a sleeping insect.\nAn insect designed in its own likeness by a mad robot.\nWhen they were airborne, Streggi once more seated beside Odrade, Streggi asked: “Will we see sandworms?”\n“Possibly. But there are no reports of them yet.”\nStreggi sat back, disappointed by the answer but unable to lever it into another question. Truth could be upsetting at\ntimes and they had such high expectations invested in this evolutionary gamble, Odrade thought.\nElse why destroy everything we loved on Chapterhouse?\nSimulflow intruded with an image of a long-ago sign arching over a narrow entry to a pink brick building: HOSPITAL FOR INCURABLE DISEASES.\nWas that where the Sisterhood found itself? Or was it that they tolerated too many failures? Intrusive Other Memory had to have its purpose.\nFailures?\nOdrade searched it out: /f it comes, we must think of Murbella as a Sister. Not that their captive Honored Matre was an incurable failure. But she was a misfit and undergoing the deep training at a very late age.\nHow quiet they were all around her, everyone looking out at windswept sand—whaleback dunes giving way at times to dry wavelets. Early afternoon sun had just begun to provide sufficient sidelighting to define near vistas. Dust obscured the horizon ahead.\nOdrade curled up in her seat and slept. /’ve seen this before. | survived Dune.\nThe stir as they came down and circled over Sheeana’s Desert Watch Center awakened her.\nDesert Watch Center. We're at it again. We haven't really named it...no more than we gave a name to this planet. Chapterhouse! What kind of a name is that? Desert Watch Center! Description, not a name. Accent on the temporary.\nAs they descended, she saw confirmations of her thought. The sense of temporary housing was amplified by spartan abruptness in all junctures. No softness, no rounding of any connection. This attaches here and that goes over there. All joined by removable connectors.\nIt was a bumpy landing, the pilot telling them that way: “Here you are and good riddance.”\nOdrade went immediately to the room always set aside for her and summoned Sheeana. Temporary quarters:\nanother spartan cubicle with hard cot. Two chairs this time. A window looked westward onto desert. The temporary nature of these rooms grated on her. Anything here could be dismantled in hours and carted away. She washed her face in the adjoining bathroom, getting the most out of movement. She had slept in a cramped position on the ‘thopter and her body complained.\nRefreshed, she went out to a window, thankful that the erection crew had included this tower: ten floors, and this the ninth. Sheeana occupied the top floor, a vantage for doing what the name of the place described.\nWhile waiting, Odrade made necessary preparations.\nOpen the mind. Shed preconceptions.\nFirst impressions when Sheeana arrived must be seen with naive eyes. Ears must not be prepared for a particular voice. Nose must not expect remembered odors.\n| chose this one. I, her first teacher, am susceptible to mistakes.\nOdrade turned at a sound from the doorway. Streggi.\n“Sheeana has just returned from the desert and is with her people. She asks Mother Superior to meet her in the upper quarters, which are more comfortable.”\nOdrade nodded.\nSheeana’s quarters on the top floor still had that prefab look at the edges. Quick shelter ahead of the desert. A large room, six or seven times the size of the guest cubicle, but then it was both workroom and sleeping chamber. Windows on two sides—west and north. Odrade was struck by the mixture of functional and non-functional.\nSheeana had managed to make her rooms reflect herself. A standard Bene Gesserit cot had been covered with a bright orange and umber spread. A black-on-white line drawing of a sandworm, head-on with all of its crystal teeth displayed, filled an end wall. Sheeana had drawn it, relying on Other Memory and her Dune childhood to guide her hand.\nIt said something about Sheeana that she had not attempted a more ambitious rendering—full color, perhaps, and in traditional desert setting. Just the worm and a hint of sand beneath it, a tiny robed human in the foreground.\nHerself?\nAdmirable restraint and a constant reminder of why she was here. A deep impression of nature.\nNature makes no bad art?\nIt was a statement too glib to accept.\nWhat do we mean by “nature”?\nShe had seen atrocious natural wilderness: brittle trees looking as though they had been dipped in faulty green pigment and left on a tundra’s edge to dry into ugly parodies. Repellent. Hard to imagine such trees having any purpose. And blindworms . . . slimy yellow skins. Where was the art in them? Temporary stopping place on evolution’s journey elsewhere. Did the intervention of humans always make a difference? Sligs! The Bene Tleilax had produced something disgusting there.\nAdmiring Sheeana’s drawing, Odrade decided certain combinations offended particular human senses. Sligs as food were delectable. Ugly combinations touched early experiences. Experiences judged.\nBad thing!\nMuch of what we think of as ART caters to desires for reassurance. Don’t offend me! I know what I can accept.\nHow did this drawing reassure Sheeana?\nSandworm: blind power guarding hidden riches. Artistry in mystic beauty.\nIt was reported that Sheeana joked about her assignment. “I am shepherd to worms that may never exist.”\nAnd even if they did appear, it would be years before any achieved the size indicated by her drawing. Was it her voice from the tiny figure in front of the worm?\n“This will come in time.”\nAn odor of melange pervaded the room, stronger than usual in a Reverend Mother’s quarters. Odrade passed a searching look across the furnishings: chairs, worktable, illumination from anchored glowglobes—everything placed where it would serve to advantage. But what was that oddly Shaped mound of black plaz in the corner? More of Sheeana’s work?\nThese rooms fitted Sheeana, Odrade decided. Little other than the drawing to recall her origins but the view out any window might have been from Dar-es-Balat deep in Dune’s dry-lands.\nA small rustling sound at the doorway alerted Odrade. She turned and there was Sheeana. Almost shy the way she peered around the door before entering Mother Superior’s presence.\nMotion as words: “So she did come to my rooms. Good. Someone might have been careless with my invitation.”\nOdrade’s readied senses tingled with Sheeana’s presence. The youngest-ever Reverend Mother. You often thought of Quiet Little Sheeana. She was not always quiet nor was she small but the label stuck. She was not even mousy, but frequently quiet like a rodent waiting at the edge of a field for the farmer to leave. Then the mouse would come darting out to glean fallen grains.\nSheeana\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8645d48fea0070f6f0783629c1992f16567a2ec62418e75370004faa48e8538a_v2"}
