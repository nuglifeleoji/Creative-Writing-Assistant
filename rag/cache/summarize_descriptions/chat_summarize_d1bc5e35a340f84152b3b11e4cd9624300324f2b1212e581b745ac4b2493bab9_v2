This relationship is marked by mutual understanding, as Shai-Hulud not only spared her life but also obeys her commands, a phenomenon rarely witnessed among the Fremen or other inhabitants of Arrakis. The sandworms, worshipped as manifestations of Shai-Hulud, respond to her summons, further highlighting her exceptional connection with them.  \n\nHer bond with Shai-Hulud transcends mere control; it reflects a deep, almost symbiotic relationship, setting her apart as a singular figure capable of influencing these ancient and revered creatures. Whether described as commanding, summoning, or communicating with the sandworms, Sheeana’s abilities consistently emphasize her unparalleled role in interacting with Shai-Hulud. The descriptions collectively reinforce that her power is not just functional but also spiritual, aligning with the sandworms' sacred status.  \n\nNo contradictions exist among the provided descriptions—each iteration reinforces Sheeana’s unique connection to Shai-Hulud, whether framed as communication, command, or summoning.
