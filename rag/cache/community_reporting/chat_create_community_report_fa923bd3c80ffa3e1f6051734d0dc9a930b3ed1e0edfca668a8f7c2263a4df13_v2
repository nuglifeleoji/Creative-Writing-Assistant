Composed of noble houses—including **House Atreides**, **House Harkonnen**, and **House Corrino**—it functions as both a legislative and diplomatic entity, mediating disputes, negotiating treaties, and overseeing planetary governance.  \n\nThe Landsraad acts as a check on imperial authority, restraining the Emperor’s power while collaborating with other major factions like CHOAM, which ties its economic interests to the spice trade. It played a role in maintaining order during the **Butlerian Jihad** and later addressed conflicts such as the **Arrakis Affair**, where suspicions were eased by **Count Fenring**. The assembly also served as a forum for justice, as seen when **House Atreides** sought accountability for the **Sardaukar’s treachery**.  \n\nUnder **Paul Atreides (Muad’Dib)**, the Landsraad’s influence waned; he sent it secret messages and later dissolved it during his rule.
