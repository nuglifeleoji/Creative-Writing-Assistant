Xin Ping served as a military leader allied with Yuan Tan, playing a significant role in the strategic planning and execution of military operations aimed at countering Cao Cao's influence and power. His contributions were vital in formulating strategies that sought to challenge Cao Cao's dominance in the region.\n\nIn addition to being an ally, Xin Ping was also a subordinate of Yuan Tan during these military engagements. This dual role highlights the close working relationship between the two, with Xin Ping operating under Yuan Tan's command while also exercising his own leadership capabilities in the field. Their collaboration was marked by a shared objective of resisting Cao Cao's expansion and maintaining their own positions of power.\n\nTogether, Yuan Tan and Xin Ping navigated the complexities of warfare during a time characterized by shifting alliances and intense rivalries. Their combined efforts were part of a broader struggle among various factions vying for control in a fragmented political landscape.
