They would need Duncan Idaho’s new talents to counter the whores. He was no longer merely bait for the destruction of Rakis.\n“He will not be able to leave the no-ship’s concealment, of course,” Teg said.\nShe nodded. Duncan was not shielded from prescient searchers ... such as the Guild navigators.\n“Bashar!” It was the communications officer. “We’ve been bleeped by a satellite!”\n“All right, you ground hogs!” Teg shouted. “Everybody outside! Get Burzmali in here.”\nA hatch at the rear of the station flew open. Burzmali lunged through. “Bashar, what are we—”\n“No time! Take over!” Teg lifted himself from his command chair and waved for Burzmali to take it. “Odrade here will tell you where to go.” On an impulse that he knew was partly vindictive, Teg grasped Odrade’s left arm, leaned close, and kissed her cheek. “Do what you must, daughter,” he whispered. “That worm in the hold may soon be the only one in the universe.”\nOdrade saw it then: Teg knew Taraza’s complete design and intended to carry out his Mother Superior’s orders to the very end.\n“Do what you must.” That said it all.\nWe are not looking at a new state of matter but at a newly recognized relationship between consciousness and matter, which provides a more penetrating insight into the workings of prescience. The oracle shapes a projected inner universe to produce new external probabilities out of forces that are not understood. There is no need to understand these forces before using them to shape the physical universe. Ancient metal workers had no need to understand the molecular and submolecular complexities of their steel, bronze, copper, gold, and tin. They invented mystical powers to describe the unknown while they continued to operate their forges and wield their hammers.\n—MOTHER SUPERIOR TARAZA, ARGUMENT IN COUNCIL\nhe ancient structure in which the Sisterhood secreted its\nChapter House, its Archives, and the offices of its most sacrosanct leadership did not just make sounds in the night. The noises were more like signals. Odrade had learned to read those signals over her many years here. That particular sound there, that strained creaking, was a wooden beam in the floor not replaced in some eight hundred years. It contracted in the night to produce those sounds.\nShe had Taraza’s memories to expand on such signals. The memories were not fully integrated; there had been very little time. Here at night in Taraza’s old working room, Odrade used a few available moments to continue the integration.\nDar and Tar, one at last.\nThat was a quite identifiable Taraza comment.\nTo haunt the Other Memories was to exist on several planes simultaneously, some of them very deep, but Taraza remained near the surface. Odrade allowed herself to sink farther into the multiple existences. Presently, she recognized a self who was currently breathing but remote\nwhile others demanded that she plunge into the all- enfolding visions, everything complete with smells, touches, emotions—all of the originals held intact within her own awareness.\nIt is unsettling to dream another’s dreams.\nTaraza again.\nTaraza who had played such a dangerous game with the future of the entire Sisterhood hanging in the balance! How carefully she had timed the leaking of word to the whores that the Tleilaxu had built dangerous abilities into the ghola. And the attack on the Gammu Keep confirmed that the information had reached its source. The brutal nature of that attack, though, had warned Taraza that she had little time. The whores would be sure to assemble forces for the total destruction of Gammu-—just to kill that one ghola.\nSo much had depended on Teg.\nShe saw the Bashar there in her own assemblage of Other Memories: the father she had never really known.\n| didn’t know him at the end, either.\nIt could be weakening to dig into those memories, but she could not escape the demands of that luring reservoir.\nOdrade thought of the Tyrant’s words: “The terrible field of my past! Answers leap up like a frightened flock blackening the sky of my inescapable memories.”\nOdrade held herself like a swimmer balanced just below the water’s surface.\n| most likely will be replaced, Odrade thought. / may even be reviled. Bellonda certainly was not giving easy agreement to the new state of command. No matter. Survival of the Sisterhood was all that should concern any of them.\nOdrade floated up out of the Other Memories and lifted her gaze to look across the room into the shadowy niche where the bust of a woman could be discerned in the low light of the room’s glowglobes. The bust remained a vague\nShape in its shadows but Odrade knew that face well: Chenoeh, guardian symbol of Chapter House.\n“There but for the grace of God...”\nEvery sister who came through the spice agony (as Chenoeh had not) said or thought that same thing, but what did it really mean? Careful breeding and careful training produced the successful ones in sufficient numbers. Where was the hand of God in that? God certainly was not the worm they had brought from Rakis. Was the presence of God felt only in the successes of the Sisterhood?\nI fall prey to the pretensions of my own Missionaria Protectiva!\nShe knew that these were similar to thoughts and questions that had been heard in this room on countless occasions. Bootless! Still, she could not bring herself to remove that guardian bust from the niche where it had reposed for so long.\nl am not superstitious, she told herself. / am not a compulsive person. This is a matter of tradition. Such things have a value well known to us.\nCertainly, no bust of me will ever be so honored.\nShe thought of Waff and his Face Dancers dead with Miles Teg in the terrible destruction of Rakis. It did not do to dwell on the bloody attrition being suffered in the Old Empire. Better to think about the muscles of retribution being created by the blundering violence of the Honored Matres.\nTeg knew!\nThe recently concluded Council session had subsided in fatigue without firm conclusions. Odrade counted herself lucky to have diverted attention into a few immediate concerns dear to them all.\nThe punishments: Those had occupied them for a time. Historical precedents fleshed out the Archival analyses to a satisfying form. Those assemblages of humans who allied themselves with the Honored Matres were in for some shocks.\nIx would certainly overextend itself. They had not the Slightest appreciation of how competition from the Scattering would crush them.\nThe Guild would be shunted aside and made to pay dearly for its melange and its machinery. Guild and Ix, thrown together, would fall together.\nThe Fish Speakers could be mostly ignored. Satellites of Ix, they were already fading into a past that humans would abandon.\nAnd the Bene Tleilax. Ah, yes, the Tleilaxu. Waff had succumbed to the Honored Matres. He had never admitted it but the truth was plain. “Just once and with one of my own Face Dancers.”\nOdrade smiled grimly, remembering her father’s bitter kiss.\n| will have another niche made, she thought. / will commission another bust: Miles Teg, the Great Heretic!\nLucilla’s suspicions about Teg were disquieting, though. Had he been prescient at last and able to see the no-ships? Well, the Breeding Mistresses could explore those SUSPICIONS.\n“We have laagered up!” Bellonda accused.\nThey all knew the meaning of that word: they had retreated into a fortress position for the long night of the whores.\nOdrade realized she did not much care for Bellonda, the way she laughed occasionally to expose those wide, blunt teeth.\nThey had discussed the cell samples from Sheeana for a long time. The “proof of Siona” was there. She had the ancestry that shielded her from prescience and could leave the no-ship.\nDuncan was an unknown.\nOdrade turned her thoughts to the ghola out there in the grounded no-ship. Lifting herself from the chair, she crossed\nto the dark window and looked in the direction of the distant landing field.\nDid they dare risk releasing Duncan from the shielding of that ship? The cell studies said he was a mixture of many Idaho gholas—some descendant of Siona. But what of the taint from the original?\nNo. He must remain confined.\nAnd what of Murbella?—pregnant Murbella? An Honored Matre dishonored.\n“The Tleilaxu intended for me to kill the Imprinter,” Duncan said.\n“Will you try to kill the whore?” That was Lucilla’s question.\n“She is not an Imprinter,” Duncan said.\nThe Council had discussed at length the possible nature of the bonding between Duncan and Murbella. Lucilla maintained there was no bonding at all, that the two remained wary opponents.\n“Best not to risk putting them together.”\nThe sexual prowess of the whores would have to be studied at length, though. Perhaps a meeting between Duncan and Murbella in the no-ship could be risked. With careful protective measures, of course.\nLastly, she thought about the worm in the no-ship’s hold —a worm nearing the moment of its metamorphosis. A Small earth-dammed basin filled with melange awaited that worm. When the moment came, it would be lured out by Sheeana into the bath of melange and water. The resulting sandtrout could then begin their long transformation.\nYou were right, father. It was so simple when you looked at it clearly.\nNo need to seek a desert planet for the worms. The sandtrout would create their own habitat for Shai-hulud. It was not pleasant to think of Chapter House Planet transformed into vast areas of wasteland but it had to be done.\nThe “Last Will and Testament of Miles Teg,” which he had planted in the no-ship’s submolecular storage systems, could not be discredited. Even Bellonda agreed to that.\nChapter House required a complete revision of all its historical records. A new look had been demanded of them by what Teg had seen of the Lost Ones—the whores from the Scattering.\n“You seldom learn the names of the truly wealthy and powerful. You see only their sookesmen. The political arena makes a few exceptions to this but does not reveal the full power structure.”\nThe Mentat philosopher had chewed deep into everything they accepted and what he disgorged did not agree with Archival dependence upon “our inviolate summations.”\nWe knew it, Miles, we just never faced up to it. We're all going to be digging in our Other Memories for the next few generations.\nFixed data storage systems could not be trusted.\n“If you destroy most copies, time will take care of the rest.”\nHow Archives had raged at that telling pronouncement by the Bashar!\n“The writing of history is largely a process of diversion. Most historical accounts divert attention from the secret influences around the recorded events.”\nThat was the one that had brought down Bellonda. She had taken it up on her own, admitting: “The few histories that escape this restrictive process vanish into obscurity through obvious processes.”\nTeg had listed some of the processes: “Destruction of as many copies as possible, burying the too revealing accounts in ridicule, ignoring them in the centers of education, insuring that they are not quoted elsewhere and, in some cases, elimination of the authors.”\nNot to mention the scapegoat process that brought death to more than one messenger bearing unwelcome news,\nOdrade thought. She recalled an ancient ruler who kept a pikestaff handy", " for the next few generations.\nFixed data storage systems could not be trusted.\n“If you destroy most copies, time will take care of the rest.”\nHow Archives had raged at that telling pronouncement by the Bashar!\n“The writing of history is largely a process of diversion.

She recalled an ancient ruler who kept a pikestaff handy with which to kill messengers who brought bad news.\n“We have a good base of information upon which to build a better understanding of our past,” Odrade had argued. “We've always known that what was at stake in conflicts was the determination of who would control the wealth or its equivalent.”\nMaybe it was not a real “noble purpose” but it would do for the time being.\nl am avoiding the central issue, she thought.\nSomething would have to be done about Duncan Idaho and they all knew it.\nWith a sigh, Odrade summoned a ‘thopter and prepared herself for the short trip to the no-ship.\nDuncan’s prison was at least comfortable, Odrade thought when she entered it. This had been the ship commander’s quarters lately occupied by Miles Teg. There were still signs of his presence here—a small holostat projector revealing a scene of his home on Lernaeus; the stately old house, the long lawn, the river. Teg had left a sewing kit behind on a bedside table.\nThe ghola sat in a sling chair staring at the projection. He looked up listlessly when Odrade entered.\n“You just left him back there to die, didn’t you?” Duncan asked.\n“We do what we must,” she said. “And | obeyed his orders.”\n“I know why you’re here,” Duncan said. “And you’re not going to change my mind. I’m not a damned stud for the witches. You understand me?”\nOdrade smoothed her robe and sat on the edge of the bed facing Duncan. “Have you examined the record my father left for us?” she asked.\n“Your father?”\n“Miles Teg was my father. | commend his last words to you. He was our eyes there at the end. He had to see the death on Rakis. The ‘mind at its beginning’ understood dependencies and key logs.”\nWhen Duncan looked puzzled, she explained: “We were trapped too long in the Tyrant’s oracular maze.”\nShe saw how he sat up more alertly, the feline movements that spoke of muscles well conditioned to attack.\n“There is no way you can escape alive from this ship,” She said. “You know why.”\n“Siona.”\n“You are a danger to us but we would prefer that you lived a useful life.”\n“I’m still not going to breed for you, especially not with that little twit from Rakis.”\nOdrade smiled, wondering how Sheeana would respond to that description.\n“You think it’s funny?” Duncan demanded.\n“Not really. But we’ll still have Murbella’s child, of course. | guess that will have to satisfy us.”\n“I’ve been talking to Murbella on the com,” Duncan said. “She thinks she’s going to be a Reverend Mother, that you're going to accept her into the Bene Gesserit.”\n“Why not? Her cells pass the proof of Siona. | think she will make a superb Sister.”\n“Has she really taken you in?”\n“You mean, have we failed to observe that she thinks she will go along with us until she learns our secrets and then she will escape? Oh, we know that, Duncan.”\n“You don’t think she can get away from you?”\n“Once we get them, Duncan, we never really lose them.”\n“You don’t think you lost the Lady Jessica?”\n“She came back to us in the end.”\n“Why did you really come out here to see me?”\n“| thought you deserved an explanation of the Mother Superior’s design. It was aimed at the destruction of Rakis, you see. What she really wanted was the elimination of almost all of the worms.”\n“Great Gods below! Why?”\n“They were an oracular force holding us in bondage. Those pearls of the Tyrant’s awareness magnified that hold. He didn’t predict events, he created them.”\nDuncan pointed toward the rear of the ship. “But what about...”\n“That one? It’s just one now. By the time it reaches sufficient numbers to be an influence once more, humankind will have gone its own way beyond him. We'll be too numerous by then, doing too many different things on our own. No single force will rule all of our futures completely, never again.”\nShe stood.\nWhen he did not respond, she said: “Within the imposed limits, which | know you appreciate, please think about the kind of life you want to lead. | promise to help you in any way | can.”\n“Why would you do that?”\n“Because my ancestors loved you. Because my father loved you.”\n“Love? You witches can’t feel love!”\nShe stared down at him for almost a minute. The bleached hair was growing out dark at the roots and curling once more into ringlets, especially at his neck, she saw.\n“I feel what | feel,” she said. “And your water is ours, Duncan Idaho.”\nShe saw the Fremen admonition have its effect on him and then turned away and was passed out of the room by the guards.\nBefore leaving the ship, she went back to the hold and stared down at the quiescent worm on its bed of Rakian sand. Her viewport looked down from some two hundred\nmeters onto the captive. As she looked, she shared a silent laugh with the increasingly integrated Taraza.\nWe were right and Schwangyu and her people were wrong. We knew he wanted out. He had to want that after what he did.\nShe spoke aloud in a soft whisper, as much for herself as for the nearby observers stationed there to watch for the moment when metamorphosis began in that worm.\n“We have your language now,” she said.\nThere were no words in the language, only a moving, dancing adaptation to a moving, dancing universe. You could only speak the language, not translate it. To know the meaning you had to go through the experience and even then the meaning changed before your eyes. “Noble purpose” was, after all, an untranslatable experience. But when she looked down at the rough, heat-immune hide of that worm from the Rakian desert, Odrade knew what she saw: the visible evidence of noble purpose.\nSoftly, she called down to him: “Hey! Old worm! Was this your design?”\nThere was no answer but then she had not really expected an answer.\nCHAPTERHGUSE:\n \nFRANK HERBERT\nCHAPTERHOUSE: DUNE\nFRANK HERBERT\nneliow by Brian Herk\nACE Published by Berkley An imprint of Penguin Random House LLC 1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10019\nCopyright © 1985 by Herbert Properties LLC\n“Introduction” by Brian Herbert copyright © 2009 by DreamStar, Inc.\nPenguin Random House supports copyright.

It is a fascinating milieu, populated by gholas grown from dead human cells, as well as shape-shifting Face Dancers, half-human Futars, cloned humans, and mutant, conspiratorial Guild Navigators. There are immense Heighliners that fold space to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye, along with nearly invisible no-ships and no- chambers that contain mysterious machinery.\nAs the novel opens, the planet Dune has already been destroyed by Honored Matres, powerful, enigmatic women who emerged from the Scattering that the God Emperor set into motion long ago in order to spread humankind across uncounted star systems. On planet Chapterhouse, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood has a giant sandworm, obtained surreptitiously, that is metamorphosing into sandtrout. Thus the Sisters have initiated a desertification process that could result in a new Dune, and a new source of the priceless spice melange, a finite resource that they need and hope to control...\nThis is the sixth novel in Frank Herbert’s classic, wildly popular science fiction series, and the last story in the highly imaginative Dune universe that he wrote. He typed much of the novel at his home in Hawaii, where he tended to the serious medical needs of my mother, Beverly Herbert. A professional writer herself, she helped with the plotting of the book and provided him with the title before she passed\naway in 1984.

A professional writer herself, she helped with the plotting of the book and provided him with the title before she passed\naway in 1984. My father did not complete the writing task, however, until after her death, when he returned to Washington State.\nIt is impossible for me to read Chapterhouse: Dune, or to even think about it, without experiencing powerful reminders of my mother and the relationship she had with my father for almost four decades. An extraordinary woman, she was the basis of the literary character Lady Jessica in the first three novels of the Dune series, and the source of many of the aphorisms that are so familiar to Dune fans. The strong presence of women later in the epic saga— particularly in the fifth and sixth novels—stemmed from her as well.\nAs their son, | watched my parents interact and strengthen each other in countless ways. | can honestly say that | never heard them raise their voices to each other, though they did have subtle disagreements that others might not have noticed. The words and signs that passed between them were on a different, barely perceptible level. My parents were symbiotic, highly intelligent human organisms, so closely linked that thoughts seemed to pass between them as if contained within one mind.\nFrank Herbert’s best friend, Howie Hansen, put it this way: “There are two Frank Herberts—the one | knew prior to Bev and the one that you know who was created by Bev. Frank Herbert the author would not exist had there not been a Beverly [Herbert] to marry him and... coalesce him mentally...”\nAfter my mother passed away in Hawaii, Dad wrote a long and poignant tribute to her that is published at the end of Chapterhouse: Dune, describing their life together and what they meant to each other. For years afterward, | thought that this moving testimonial was the best place to conclude the entire series. After all, they had been a writing team and had embarked on their marriage in 1946 with dreams that both of them would become successful writers. They\nachieved that, and along the way they shared numerous great adventures together—a remarkable story of love and sacrifice that | described in Dreamer of Dune (2003), the biography of Frank Herbert.\nChapterhouse: Dune carries on the suspense-filled account of the destructive Honored Matres that was begun in Heretics of Dune. Brutal women who are rumored to be renegade Bene Gesserit, they threaten to obliterate the ancient Sisterhood, and a great deal more. They seem unstoppable. And yet there is something else out there in the universe that is chasing the Honored Matres, but its identity is unrevealed by Frank Herbert. Cleverly, the author sprinkled clues throughout the novel about what it might be, and at the end the reader is left wondering and considering the options.\nBack in the 1950s and 1960s, Frank Herbert attempted to sell a number of mystery stories and—encouraged by his friend and fellow author Jack Vance—even joined Mystery Writers of America. In 1964, Dad did sell a short story to Analog, “The Mary Celeste Move,” which was a well-drawn science fiction mystery about the investigation of a peculiar phenomenon of human behavior. Aside from that, however, his mystery-writing efforts in those days went largely unrewarded. He kept running into problems with story length and genre, and publishers were not interested. So back he went to science fiction, where he enjoyed unparalleled success.\nAfter all of the rejections my father suffered with his mysteries, it is particularly interesting and satisfying that he wrote a widely published mystery story and immersed it into the Dune universe. For more than a decade after his death from an illness in 1986, the solution to this mystery was the most intriguing and widely debated subject in science fiction. How fitting this was for the legacy of a man who was so often rejected by publishers and who might never have reached a wide audience if not for the brave editor Sterling\nLanier, who took a chance and accepted Dune for hardcover publication after more than twenty other editors had turned it down.\nJust before Frank Herbert passed away, he seemed to his family like a much younger man than his sixty-five years, filled with boundless enthusiasm and energy. His passing left us with a feeling that he might have accomplished a great deal more in his already productive life if he had only lived longer... that even more remarkable achievements might have flowed from the marvelously inventive mind that created the Dune universe, the acclaimed Native American novel Soul Catcher, and other memorable novels.\nSadly, the additional works were taken from him. And from us.\nMy father left loose ends when he died, many uncompleted dreams. Like the painter Jean Gericault, at the end of his life Dad spoke of all the things he would do when he was well again. He wanted to spend a year in Paris, wanted to be the oldest man to climb Mount Everest. There were more Dune stories to tell, along with an epic novel about Native Americans, and maybe even a movie to direct. But like Gericault, he never got well.\nThe fifth and sixth novels in Frank Herbert’s Dune series— Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune—were intended to be the first two books in a new trilogy that would complete the epic story chronologically. Using my father’s outline and notes, | eventually co-wrote the grand climax with Kevin J. Anderson in two novels—Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007).\nAs you read Chapterhouse: Dune, look for intriguing clues that Frank Herbert wove into the story. Then go back and reread his preceding five novels in the series, and you'll discover more clues. He left so many possibilities, so many avenues to stretch the imaginations of his readers. Truly, the Dune saga is a tour de force, unmatched in the annals of literature.\nBrian Herbert Seattle, Washington February 7, 2009\nThose who would repeat the past must control the teaching of history.\n—BENE GESSERIT CODA\nhen the ghola-baby was delivered from the first Bene\nGesserit axlotl tank, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade ordered a quiet celebration in her private dining room atop Central. It was barely dawn, and the two other members of her Council—Tamalane and Bellonda—showed impatience at the summons, even though Odrade had ordered breakfast served by her personal chef.\n“It isn’t every woman who can preside at the birth of her own father,” Odrade quipped when the others complained they had too many demands on their time to permit of “time-wasting nonsense.”\nOnly aged Tamalane showed sly amusement.\nBellonda held her over-fleshed features expressionless, often her equivalent of a scowl.\nWas it possible, Odrade wondered, that Bell had not exorcised resentment of the relative opulence in Mother Superior’s surroundings? Odrade’s quarters were a distinct mark of her position but the distinction represented her duties more than any elevation over her Sisters. The small dining room allowed her to consult aides during meals.\nBellonda glanced this way and that, obviously impatient to be gone. Much effort had been expended without success in attempts to break through Bellonda’s coldly remote shell.\n“It felt very odd to hold that baby in my arms and think: This ts my father,” Odrade said.\n“I heard you the first time!” Bellonda spoke from the belly, almost a baritone rumbling as though each word\ncaused her vague indigestion.\nShe understood Odrade’s wry jest, though. The old Bashar Miles Teg had, indeed, been the Mother Superior’s father. And Odrade herself had collected cells (as fingernail scrapings) to grow this new ghola, part of a long-time “possibility plan” should they ever succeed in duplicating Tleilaxu tanks. But Bellonda would be drummed out of the Bene Gesserit rather than go along with Odrade’s comment on the Sisterhood’s vital equipment.\n“I find this frivolous at such a time,” Bellonda said. “Those madwomen hunting us to exterminate us and you want a celebration!”\nOdrade held herself to a mild tone with some effort. “If the Honored Matres find us before we are ready perhaps it will be because we failed to keep up our morale.”\nBellonda’s silent stare directly into Odrade’s eyes carried frustrating accusation: Those terrible women already have exterminated sixteen of our planets!\nOdrade knew it was wrong to think of those planets as Bene Gesserit possessions. The loosely organized confederation of planetary governments assembled after the Famine Times and the Scattering depended heavily on the Sisterhood for vital services and reliable communications, but old factions persisted—CHOAM, Spacing Guild, Tleilaxu, remnant pockets of the Divided God’s priesthood, even Fish Speaker auxiliaries and schismatic assemblages. The Divided God had bequeathed humankind a divided empire—all of whose factions were suddenly moot because of rampaging Honored Matre assaults from the Scattering. The Bene Gesserit—holding to most of their old forms—were the natural prime target for attack.\nBellonda’s thoughts never strayed far from this Honored Matre threat. It was a weakness Odrade recognized. Sometimes, Odrade hesitated on the point of replacing Bellonda, but even in the Bene Gesserit there were factions\nthese days and no one could deny that Bell was a supreme organizer. Archives had never been more efficient than under her guidance.\nAs she frequently did, Bellonda without even speaking the words managed to focus Mother Superior’s attention on the hunters who stalked them with savage persistence. It spoiled the mood of quiet success Odrade had hoped to achieve this morning.\nShe forced herself to think of the new ghola. Jeg! If his Original memories could be restored, the Sisterhood once more would have the finest Bashar ever to serve them. A Mentat Bashar! A military genius whose prowess already was the stuff of myths in the Old Empire.\nBut would even Teg be of use against these women returned from the Scattering?\nBy whatever gods may be, the Honored Matres must not find us! Not yet!\nTeg represented too many disturbing unknowns and possibilities. Mystery surrounded the period before his death in the destruction of Dune. He did something on Gammu to ignite the unbridled fury of the Honored Matres. His suicidal stand on Dune should not have been enough to bring this berserk response. There were rumors, bits and pieces from his days on Gammu before the Dune disaster. He could move too fast for the human eye to see! Had he done that? Another outcropping of wild abilities in Atreides genes? Mutation? Or just more of the Teg myth? The Sisterhood had to learn as soon as possible.\nAn acolyte brought in three breakfasts and the sisters ate quickly, as though this interruption must be put behind them without delay because time wasted was dangerous.\nEven after the others had gone, Odrade was left with the aftershock of Bellonda’s unspoken fears.\nAnd my fears.\nShe arose and went to the wide window that looked across lower rooftops to part of the ring of orchards and\npastures around Central. Late spring and already fruit beginning to form out there. Rebirth. A new Teg was born today! No feeling of elation accompanied the thought. Usually she found the view restorative but not this morning.\nWhat are my real strengths? What are my facts?\nThe resources at a Mother Superior’s command were formidable: profound loyalty in those who served her, a military arm under a Teg-trained Bashar (far away now with a large portion of their troops guarding the school planet, Lampadas), artisans and technicians, spies and agents throughout the Old Empire, countless workers who looked to the Sisterhood to"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_a343d7708b3ea5a9e169bb5d18a729cc15ad70e77ae93cd609493ee503274181_v2"}
