It was in your history that you took the water of unwary travelers. By now this would be common ritual with you. How else could you silence the ones who chanced upon you? How else keep your secret? Batigh! You’d seduce me with gentle epithets and kindly words. Why waste any of my water upon the sand? And if | were missed as were many of the others—well, the Tanzerouft got me.”\nMuriz made the Horns-of-the-Worm sign with his right hand to ward off the Rihani which Leto’s words called up. And Leto, knowing how older Fremen distrusted mentats or anything which smacked of them by a show of extended logic, Suppressed a smile.\n“Manri spoke of us at Jacurutu,” Muriz said. “I will have his water when—”\n“You'll have nothing but empty sand if you continue playing the fool,” Leto said. “What will you do, Muriz, when all of Dune has become green grass, trees, and open water?”\n“It will never happen!”\n“It is happening before your eyes.”\nLeto heard Muriz’s teeth grinding in rage and frustration. Presently the man grated: “How would you prevent this?”\n“I know the entire plan of the transformation,” Leto said. “I Know every weakness in it, every strength. Without me, Shai-Hulud will vanish forever.”\nA sly note returning to his voice, Muriz asked: “Well, why dispute it here? We’re at a standoff. You have your knife. You could kill me, but Behaleth would shoot you.”\n“Not before | recovered your pistol,” Leto said. “Then I’d have your ‘thopter. Yes, | can fly it.”\nA scowl creased Muriz’s forehead beneath the hood. “What if you’re not who you say?”\n“Will my father not identify me?” Leto asked.\n“Ahnhhh,” Muriz said. “There’s how you learned, eh? But...” He broke off, shook his head. “My own son guides him. He says you two have never... How could...”\n“So you don’t believe Muad’Dib reads the future,” Leto said.\n“Of course we believe! But he says of himself that. . .” Again Muriz broke off.\n“And you thought him unaware of your distrust,” Leto said. “I came to this exact place in this exact time to meet you, Muriz. | Know all about you because I’ve seen you... and your son. | know how secure you believe yourselves, how you sneer at Muad’Dib, how you plot to save your little patch of desert. But your little patch of desert is doomed without me, Muriz. Lost forever. It has gone too far here on Dune. My father has almost run out of vision, and you can only turn to me.”\n“That blind...” Muriz stopped, swallowed.\n“He'll return soon from Arrakeen,” Leto said, “and then we Shall see how blind he is. How far have you gone from the old Fremen ways, Muriz?”\n“What?”\n“He is Wadquiyas with you. Your people found him alone in the desert and brought him to Shuloch. What a rich\ndiscovery he was! Richer than a spice-vein. Wadquiyas! He has lived with you; his water mingled with your tribe’s water. He’s part of your Spirit River.” Leto pressed the knife hard against Muriz’s robe. “Careful, Muriz.” Leto lifted his left hand, released the Fremen’s face flap, dropped it.\nKnowing what Leto planned, Muriz said: “Where would you go if you killed us both?”\n“Back to Jacurutu.”\nLeto pressed the fleshy part of his own thumb against Muriz’s mouth. “Bite and drink, Muriz. That or die.”\nMuriz hesitated, then bit viciously into Leto’s flesh.\nLeto watched the man’s throat, saw the swallowing convulsion, withdrew the knife and returned it.\n“Wadquliyas,” Leto said. “| must offend the tribe before you can take my water.”\nMuriz nodded.\n“Your pistol is over there.” Leto gestured with his chin.\n“You trust me now?” Muriz asked.\n“How else can | live with the Cast Out?”\nAgain Leto saw the sly look in Muriz’s eyes, but this time it was a measuring thing, a weighing of economics. The man turned away with an abruptness which told of secret decisions, recovered his maula pistol and returned to the wing step. “Come,” he said. “We tarry too long in a worm’s lair.”\nThe future of prescience cannot always be locked into the rules of the past. The threads of existence tangle according to many unknown laws. Prescient future insists on its own rules. It will not conform to the ordering of the Zensunni nor to the ordering of science. Prescience builds a relative integrity. It demands the work of this instant, always warning that you cannot weave every thread into the fabric of the past.\n—KALIMA: THE WORDS OF MUAD'DIB THE SHULOCH COMMENTARY\nM uriz brought the ornithopter in over Shuloch with a practiced ease. Leto, seated beside him, felt the armed presence of Behaleth behind them. Everything went on trust now and the narrow thread of his vision to which he clung. If that failed, A/lahu akbahr. Sometimes one had to submit to a greater order.\nThe butte of Shuloch was impressive in this desert. Its unmarked presence here spoke of many bribes and many deaths, of many friends in high places. Leto could see at Shuloch’s heart a cliff-walled pan with interfringing blind canyons leading down into it. A thick growth of shadescale and salt bushes lined the lower edges of these canyons with an inner ring of fan palms, indicating the water riches of this place. Crude buildings of greenbush and spice-fiber had been built out from the fan palms. The buildings were green buttons scattered on the sand. There would live the cast out of the Cast Out, those who could go no lower except into death.\nMuriz landed in the pan near the base of one of the canyons. A single structure stood on the sand directly ahead of the ‘thopter: a thatch of desert vines and bejato leaves, all lined with heat-fused spice-fabric. It was the living replica of the first crude stilltents and it spoke of degradation for\nsome who lived in Shuloch. Leto knew the place would leak moisture and would be full of night-biters from the nearby growth. So this was how his father lived. And poor Sabiha. Here would be her punishment.\nAt Muriz’s order Leto let himself out of the ‘thopter, jumped down to the sand, and strode toward the hut. He could see many people working farther toward the canyon among the palms. They looked tattered, poor, and the fact that they barely glanced at him or at the ‘thopter said much of the oppression here. Leto could see the rock lip of a qanat beyond the workers, and there was no mistaking the sense of moisture in this air: open water. Passing the hut, Leto saw it was as crude as he’d expected. He pressed on to the qanat, peered down and saw the swirl of predator fish in the dark flow. The workers, avoiding his eyes, went on with clearing sand away from the line of rock openings.\nMuriz came up behind Leto, said: “You stand on the boundary between fish and worm. Each of these canyons has its worm. This qanat has been opened and we will remove the fish presently to attract sandtrout.”\n“Of course,” Leto said. “Holding pens. You sell sandtrout and worms off-planet.”\n“It was Muad’Dib’s suggestion!”\n“I know. But none of your worms or sandtrout survive for long away from Dune.”\n“Not yet,” Muriz said. “But someday .. .”\n“Not in ten thousand years,” Leto said. And he turned to watch the turmoil on Muriz’s face. Questions flowed there like the water in the qanat. Could this son of Muad’Dib really read the future? Some still believed Muad’Dib had done it, but... How could a thing such as this be judged?\nPresently Muriz turned away, led them back to the hut. He opened the crude doorseal, motioned for Leto to enter. There was a spice-oil lamp burning against the far wall and a small figure squatted beneath it, back to the door. The burning oil gave off a heavy fragrance of cinnamon.\n“They've sent down a new captive to care for Muad’Dib’s sietch,” Muriz sneered. “If she serves well, she may keep her water for a time.” He confronted Leto. “Some think it evil to take such water. Those lace-shirt Fremen now make rubbish heaps in their new towns! Rubbish heaps! When has Dune ever before seen rubbish heaps! When we get such as this one—” He gestured toward the figure by the lamp. “— they’re usually half wild with fear, lost to their own kind and never accepted by true Fremen. Do you understand me, Leto-Batigh?”\n“I understand you.” The crouching figure had not moved.\n“You speak of leading us,” Muriz said. “Fremen are led by men who've been blooded. What could you lead us in?”\n“Kralizec,” Leto said, keeping his attention on the crouched figure.\nMuriz glared at him, brows contracted over his indigo eyes. Kralizec? That wasn’t merely war or revolution; that was the Typhoon Struggle. It was a word from the furthermost Fremen legends: the battle at the end of the universe. Kralizec?\nThe tall Fremen swallowed convulsively. This sprat was as unpredictable as a city dandy! Muriz turned to the squatting figure. “Woman! Liban wahid!” he commanded. Bring us the spice-drink!\nShe hesitated. “Do as he says, Sabiha,” Leto said.\nShe jumped to her feet, whirling. She stared at him, unable to take her gaze from his face.\n“You know this one?” Muriz asked.\n“She is Namri’s niece. She offended Jacurutu and they have sent her to you.”\n“Namri? But...”\n“Liban wahid,” Leto said.\nShe rushed past them, tore herself through the doorseal and they heard the sound of her running feet.\n“She will not go far,” Muriz said. He touched a finger to the side of his nose. “A kin of Namri, eh. Interesting. What\ndid she do to offend?”\n“She allowed me to escape.” Leto turned then and followed Sabiha. He found her standing at the edge of the qanat. Leto moved up beside her and looked down at the water. There were birds in the nearby fan palms and he heard their calls, their wings. The workers made scraping sounds as they moved sand. Still he did as Sabiha did, looking down, deep into the water and its reflections. The corners of his eyes saw blue parakeets in the palm fronds. One flew across the qanat and he saw it reflected in a silver swirl of fish, all run together as though birds and predators swam in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8381ec786e4498c838b5c87b3aaccd955ee3f73b53f021b999fa7ec3e1441884_v2"}
