It was one of the three major states, alongside Shu Han and Wei, and was strategically located in the southeastern part of the country. The state is renowned for its military strategies, leadership, and naval power, which were pivotal in its confrontations with rival states.\n\nUnder the leadership of prominent figures such as 周瑜 (Zhou Yu), 东吴 developed a reputation for its effective military tactics and strategic alliances. These alliances were crucial in its efforts to maintain power and resist invasions from other states, particularly during the tumultuous times of the Three Kingdoms.
