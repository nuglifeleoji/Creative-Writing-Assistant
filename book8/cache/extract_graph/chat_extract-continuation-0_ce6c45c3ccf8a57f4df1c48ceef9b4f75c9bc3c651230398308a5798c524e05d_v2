叶锋的胸前剧烈的起伏着，他是多想一拳打爆詹京的头啊！可是，现在他根本没可能这么做。犯罪分子的狡猾和强大，已经完全超出了他们这次的预判。\n\n    “放了他。”叶锋几乎是咬碎了一口钢牙，不得不下达了命令。\n\n    詹京的手铐和控制被打开，他咧嘴朝着叶锋一笑，嘴角处还有先前被叶锋打出的血迹，抬手朝着外面指了指。\n\n    叶锋深吸口气，现在最大的问题是，他根本就联络不上支援，就在刚才，他已经有下属悄然离开，去想办法联系了。可是，能否联系的上现在还是个未知数。\n\n    这里的恐怖分子数量实在是太多了，远远超出他想象的多。紫萝城的警察面对这种程度的犯罪分子根本没什么办法，现在需要的是军队，可是，军队又岂是那么容易调派过来的？\n\n    詹京根本没再去看叶锋，旁若无人的走到智库中心主脑处，开始了他的操作。\n\n    “中央银行联通，保持通讯，我开始收割了。嘿嘿嘿嘿。”他得意的把自己的通讯器重新戴上，联络上了己方的第二条线路。\n\n    “你需要多久？”通讯器中传来永夜君王的声音。\n\n    “不用多久，先前我已经在里面种下了种子，自己就完成联通了，按照原计划，再给我一分钟就足够了。”\n\n    “好，全员准备撤退。”\n\n    “干扰卫星信号，隐形战舰降落。罪恶之城的子民们，我是你们的永夜君王，现在，全员准备撤退。按原计划进行。”\n\n    紫萝城上空，空气轻微的扭曲波动起来，而就在这时，三枚监控卫星突然遭遇到了超强的电磁信号干扰，所有的监控在须臾之间全部停滞。\n\n    扭曲的空气之中，一艘通体漆黑的战舰就那么从紫萝城上空千米处钻了出来，背后尾焰喷吐，迅速下落，直接降临到了天际大厦顶部之上。\n\n    “砰砰砰、砰砰砰！”\n\n    天际大厦的金属玻璃纷纷破碎，一道道身影在机甲光焰的喷射之中飞射而起，向天际大厦顶部集中。\n\n    叶锋透过玻璃能够看到，那一道道身穿微型机甲的身影从窗外掠过，直奔顶部而去。\n\n    从这些犯罪分子的装备就能看出，他们的装备决不下于枭龙特战团。可是，自己的人却如同投鼠忌器一般，根本动都不敢动。\n\n    从开始行动到掌控局面，整个过程其实罪恶之城这些犯罪分子并没有太多时间，很显然，所有的一切都在他们计算之内，也包括己方的诱敌之策。\n\n
