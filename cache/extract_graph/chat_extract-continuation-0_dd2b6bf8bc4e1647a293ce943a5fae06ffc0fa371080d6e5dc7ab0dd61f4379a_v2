Taraza was headed somewhere important with this conversation. Key log: a truly ancient concept from the days before suspensors when lumbermen sent their fallen timber rushing down rivers to central mill sites. Sometimes the logs jammed up in the river and an expert was brought in to find the one log, the key log, which would free the jam when removed. Teg, she knew, would have an intellectual understanding of the term but she and Taraza could call up actual witnesses from Other Memories, see the explosion of broken bits of wood and water as a jam was released.\n“The Tyrant was a key log,” Taraza said. “He created the jam and he released it.”\nThe lighter began trembling sharply as it took its first bite of Gammu’s atmosphere. Odrade felt the tightness of her restraining harness for a few seconds, then the craft’s passage became steadier. Conversation stopped for this interval, then Taraza continued:\n“Beyond the so-called natural dependencies are some religions that have been created psychologically. Even physical necessities can have such an underground component.”\n“A fact the Missionaria Protectiva understands quite well,” Teg said. Again, Odrade heard that undercurrent of deep resentment in his voice. Taraza certainly must hear it, too. What was she doing? She could weaken Teg!\n“Ahhh, yes,” Taraza said. “Our Missionaria Protectiva. Humans have such a powerful need that their own belief\nstructure be the ‘true belief.’ If it gives you pleasure or a sense of security and if it is incorporated into your belief structure, what a powerful dependency that creates!”\nAgain, Taraza fell silent while their lighter went through another atmospheric buffeting.\n“I wish he would use his suspensors!” Taraza complained.\n“It saves fuel,” Teg said. “Less dependency.”\nTaraza chuckled. “Oh, yes, Miles. You know the lesson well. | see your mother’s hand in it. Damn the dam when the child strikes out in a dangerous direction.”\n“You think of me as a child?” he asked.\n“I think of you as someone who has just had his first direct encounter with the machinations of the so-called Honored Matres.”\nSo that’s it, Odrade thought. And with a feeling of shock, Odrade realized that Taraza was aiming her words ata broader target than just Teg.\nShe’s talking to me!\n“These Honored Matres, as they call themselves,” Taraza said, “have combined sexual ecstasy and worship. | doubt that they have even guessed at the dangers.”\nOdrade opened her eyes and looked across the aisle at the Mother Superior. Taraza’s gaze was fixed intently on Teg, an unreadable expression except for the eyes, which burned with the necessity for him to understand.\n“Dangers,” Taraza repeated. “The great mass of humankind possesses an unmistakable unit-identity. It can be one thing. It can act as a single organism.”\n“So the Tyrant said,” Teg countered.\n“So the Tyrant demonstrated! The Group Soul was his to manipulate. There are times, Miles, when survival demands that we commune with the soul. Souls, you know, are always seeking outlet.”\n“Hasn't communing with souls gone out of style in our time?” Teg asked. Odrade did not like the bantering tone in\nhis voice and noted that it aroused a matching anger in Taraza.\n“You think | talk about fashions in religion?” Taraza demanded, her high-pitched voice insistently harsh. “We both know religions can be created! I’m talking about these Honored Matres who ape some of our ways but have none of our deeper awareness. They dare place themselves at the center of worship!”\n“A thing the Bene Gesserit always avoids,” he said. “My mother said that worshipers and the worshiped are united by the faith.”\n“And they can be divided!”\nOdrade saw Teg suddenly fall into Mentat mode, an unfocused stare in his eyes, his features placid. She saw now part of what Taraza was doing. The Mentat rides Roman, one foot on each steed. Each foot is based on a different reality as the pattern-search hurtles him forward. He must ride different realities to a single goal.\nTeg spoke in a Mentat’s musing, unaccented voice: “Divided forces will battle for supremacy.”\nTaraza gave a sigh of pleasure almost sensual in its natural venting.\n“Dependency infrastructure,” Taraza said. “These women from the Scattering would control dividing forces, all of those forces trying mightily to take the lead. That military officer on the Guildship, when he spoke of his Honored Matres, spoke with both awe and hatred. I’m sure you heard it in his voice, Miles. | know how well your mother taught you.”\n“| heard.” Teg was once more focused on Taraza, hanging on her every word as was Odrade.\n“Dependencies,” Taraza said. “How simple they can be and how complex. Take, for example, tooth decay.”\n“Tooth decay?” Teg was shocked off his Mentat track and Odrade, observing this, saw that his reaction was precisely\nwhat Taraza wanted. Taraza was playing her Mentat Bashar with a fine hand.\nAnd I am supposed to see this and learn from it, Odrade thought.\n“Tooth decay,” Taraza repeated. “A simple implant at birth prevents this bane for most of humankind. Still, we must brush the teeth and otherwise care for them. It is so natural to us that we seldom think about it. The devices we use are assumed to be wholly ordinary parts of our environment. Yet the devices, the materials in them, the instructors in tooth care and the Suk monitors, all have their interlocked relationships.”\n“A Mentat does not need interdependencies explained to him,” Teg said. There was still curiosity in his voice but with a definite undertone of resentment.\n“Quite,” Taraza said. “That is the natural environment of a Mentat’s thinking process.”\n“Then why do you belabor this?”\n“Mentat, look at what you now know of these Honored Matres and tell me: What is their flaw?”\nTeg spoke without hesitation: “They can only survive if they continue to increase the dependency of those who Support them. It’s an addict’s dead-end street.”\n“Precisely. And the danger?”\n“They could take much of humankind down with them.”\n“That was the Tyrant’s problem, Miles. I’m sure he knew it. Now, pay attention to me with great care. And you, too, Dar.” Taraza looked across the aisle and met Odrade’s gaze. “Both of you listen to me. We of the Bene Gesserit are setting very powerful... elements adrift in the human current. They may jam up. They are sure to cause damage. And we...”\nOnce more, the lighter entered a period of severe buffeting. Conversation was impossible while they clung to their seats and listened to the roaring, creaking around them. When this interruption eased, Taraza raised her voice.\n“If we survive this damnable machine and get down to Gammu, you must go aside with Dar there, Miles. You have seen the Atreides Manifesto. She will tell you about it and prepare you. That is all.”\nTeg turned and looked at Odrade. Once more, her features tugged at his memories: a remarkable likeness to Lucilla, but there was something else. He put this aside. The Atreides Manifesto? He had read it because it came to him from Taraza with instructions that he do so. Prepare me? For what?\nOdrade saw the questioning look on Teg’s face. Now, she understood Taraza’s motive. The Mother Superior’s orders took on a new meaning as did words from the Manifesto itself.\n“Just as the universe is created by the participation of consciousness, the prescient human carries that creative faculty to its ultimate extreme. This was the profoundly misunderstood power of the Atreides bastard, the power that he transmitted to his son, the Tyrant.”\nOdrade knew those words with an author’s intimacy but they came back to her now as though she had never before encountered them.\nDamn you, Tar! Odrade thought. What if you’re wrong?\nAt the quantum level our universe can be seen as an indeterminate place, predictable in a statistical way only when you employ large enough numbers. Between that universe and a relatively predictable one where the passage of a single planet can be timed to a picosecond, other forces come into play. For the in-between universe where we find our daily lives, that which you believe is a dominant force. Your beliefs order the unfolding of daily events. If enough of us believe, a new thing can be made to exist. Belief structure creates a filter through which chaos is sifted into order.\n—ANALYSIS OF THE TYRANT, THE TARAZA FILE: BG ARCHIVES\neg’s thoughts were in turmoil as he returned to Gammu\nfrom the Guildship. He stepped from the lighter at the black-charred edge of the Keep’s private landing field and looked around him as though for the first time. Almost noon. So little time had passed and so much had changed.\nTo what extent would the Bene Gesserit go in imparting an essential lesson? he wondered. Taraza had dislodged him from his familiar Mentat processes. He felt that the whole incident on the Guildship had been staged just for him. He had been shaken from a predictable course. How strange Gammu appeared as he crossed the guarded strip to the entry pits.\nTeg had seen many planets, learned their ways and how they printed themselves on their inhabitants. Some planets had a big yellow sun that sat in close and kept living things warm, evolving, growing. Some planets had little shimmer- suns that hung far away in a dark sky, and their light touched very little. Variations existed within and even outside this range. Gammu was a yellow-green variation with a day of 31.27 standard hours and a 2.6 SY. Teg had thought he knew Gammu.\nWhen the Harkonnens were forced to abandon it, colonists left behind by the Scattering came from the Danian group, calling it by the Halleck name given to it in the great remapping. The colonists had been known as Caladanian in those days but millennia tended to shorten some labels.\nTeg paused at the entryway to the protective revetments that led from the field down beneath the Keep. Taraza and her party lagged behind him. He saw Taraza was talking intently to Odrade.\nAtreides Manifesto, he thought.\nEven on Gammu, few admitted to either Harkonnen or Atreides ancestry, although the genotypes were visible here —especially the dominant Atreides: those long, sharp noses, the high foreheads and sensual mouths. Often, the pieces were scattered—the mouth on one face, those piercing eyes on another and countless mixtures. Sometimes, though, one person carried it all and then you saw the pride, that inner knowledge:\n“lam one of them!”\nGammu’s natives recognized it and gave it walkway room but few labeled it.\nUnderlying all of this was what the Harkonnens had left behind—genetic lines tracing far away into the dawn times of Greek and Pathan and Mameluke, shadows of ancient history that few outside of professional historians or those trained by the Bene Gesserit could even name.\nTaraza and her party caught up with Teg. He heard her say to Odrade: “You must tell Miles all of it.”\nVery well, she would tell him, he thought. He turned\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, engaging in deep philosophical and strategic discussions with Teg and Odrade about dependencies and the Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit sister, observing and learning from Taraza's interactions with Teg, and is tasked with preparing Teg regarding the Atreides Manifesto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is a Mentat and Bashar, trained by the Bene Gesserit, involved in strategic discussions about the Honored Matres and the Atreides Manifesto.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A powerful and ancient sisterhood with deep political and religious influence, focused on genetic lines and human control.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group from the Scattering who combine sexual ecstasy and worship, seen as a threat by the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAMMU<|>GEO<|>A planet with a complex history, formerly controlled by the Harkonnens, now a significant location for the Bene Gesserit.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRANT<|>PERSON<|>A historical figure referenced as a 'key log' who manipulated the Group Soul and whose legacy influences current events.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES MANIFESTO<|>EVENT<|>A document of significant importance to the Bene Gesserit, discussing the creative power of consciousness and the legacy of the Atreides.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A branch of the Bene Gesserit that manipulates religions and beliefs to serve the sisterhood's goals.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Taraza is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, leading its strategic and philosophical endeavors.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade is a member of the Bene Gesserit, involved in its missions and teachings.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Teg is a Mentat and Bashar trained by the Bene Gesserit, serving its interests.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>TEG<|>Taraza is instructing and manipulating Teg to understand the dangers posed by the Honored Matres.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>ODRADE<|>Taraza is guiding Odrade, preparing her for future responsibilities within the Bene Gesserit.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TEG<|>Odrade is tasked with preparing Teg regarding the Atreides Manifesto.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit views the Honored Matres as a significant threat due to their methods and influence.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>HONORED MATRES<|>Teg is analyzing the Honored Matres' flaws and dangers under Taraza's guidance.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>ATREIDES MANIFESTO<|>Taraza is using the Atreides Manifesto as a tool to guide Teg and Odrade.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>ATREIDES MANIFESTO<|>Odrade is deeply familiar with the Atreides Manifesto and is tasked with explaining it to Teg.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>ATREIDES MANIFESTO<|>Teg has read the Atreides Manifesto and is being prepared by Odrade to understand its implications.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>MISSIONARIA PROTECTIVA<|>The Missionaria Protectiva is a branch of the Bene Gesserit, manipulating religions for the sisterhood's benefit.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TARAZA<|>TYRANT<|>Taraza references the Tyrant as a historical figure who manipulated the Group Soul, drawing parallels to current events.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEG<|>TYRANT<|>Teg acknowledges the Tyrant's demonstrations of the Group Soul's manipulation.<|>5\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
