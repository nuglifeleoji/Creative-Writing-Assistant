�至阙下。今日得睹龙颜，臣之幸也。”睿宣太子曹芳，大将军曹爽，侍中刘放、孙资等，皆至御榻之前。睿执司马懿之手曰：“昔刘玄德在白帝城病危，以幼子刘禅托孤于诸葛孔明，孔明因此竭尽忠诚，至死方休：偏邦尚然如此，何况大国乎？朕幼子曹芳，年才八岁，不堪掌理社稷。幸太尉及宗兄元勋旧臣，竭力相辅，无负朕心！”又唤芳曰：“仲达与朕一体，尔宜敬礼之。”遂命懿携芳近前。芳抱懿颈不放。睿曰：“太尉勿忘幼子今日相恋之情！”言讫，潸然泪下。懿顿首流涕。魏主昏沉，口不能言，只以手指太子，须臾而卒；在位十三年，寿三十六岁，时魏景初三年春正月下旬也。\n\n    当下司马懿、曹爽，扶太子曹芳即皇帝位。芳字兰卿，乃睿乞养之子，秘在宫中，人莫知其所由来。于是曹芳谥睿为明帝，葬于高平陵；尊郭皇后为皇太后；改元正始元年。司马懿与曹爽辅政。爽事懿甚谨，一应大事，必先启知。爽字昭伯，自幼出入宫中，明帝见爽谨慎，甚是爱敬。爽门下有客五百人，内有五人以浮华相尚：一是何晏，字平叔；一是邓飏，字玄茂，乃邓禹之后；一是李胜，字公昭；一是丁谧，字彦靖；一是毕轨，字昭先。又有大司农桓范字元则，颇有智谋，人多称为智囊。此数人皆爽所信任。\n\n    何晏告爽曰：“主公大权，不可委托他人，恐生后患。爽曰：“司马公与我同受先帝托孤之命，安忍背之？”晏曰：“昔日先公与仲达破蜀兵之时，累受此人之气，因而致死。主公如何不察也？”爽猛然省悟，遂与多官计议停当，入奏魏主曹芳曰：“司马懿功高德重，可加为太傅。”芳从之，自是兵权皆归于爽。爽命弟曹羲为中领军，曹训为武卫将军，曹彦为散骑常侍，各引三千御林军，任其出入禁宫。又用何晏、邓飏、丁谧为尚书，毕轨为司隶校尉，李胜为河南尹：此五人日夜与爽议事。于是曹爽门下宾客日盛。司马懿推病不出，二子亦皆退职闲居。爽每日与何晏等饮酒作乐：凡用衣服器皿，与朝廷无异；各处进贡玩好珍奇之物，先取上等者入己，然后进宫，佳人美女，充满府院。黄门张当，谄事曹爽，私选先帝侍妾七八人，送入府中；爽又选善歌舞良家子女三四十人，为家乐\n######################\nOutput:",
