。田牛在混战开始、外姓人纷纷撤退的时候，他觉得更有意思了，竟然笑嘻嘻地顺手拉了一根柴棍子，也搀和到里面打开了。他不分敌我，见谁打谁。王姓户族的人以为他是金家的人，就和这个憨汉也打了起来。田牛身上挨了几棍，顿时勃然大怒，混乱中，他拿棍子追着把金俊武的一只猪娃子腿打折还不罢休，又把一只老母鸡也打死了！ \n　　正在双方打得难分难解之时，金家户族里一个对田福堂极端不满的人，突然对王家庄的人喊叫说：“门是大队书记田福堂让关起来的，你们不找他算帐，在这里遭什么殃呢！” \n　　这不怀好意的谣言一下子扭转了这场战争的局势。王家庄的人根本不知道双水村的情况，立刻对这话信以为真了。 \n　　这群盲目的暴徒先后停止了在金家院子的攻击，在为首的人带领下，直奔田家圪崂去了——这真是一个戏剧性的变化！ \n　　现在，金俊武和金俊文家的院子，遍地狼藉。外村王家族里被打伤的人，被同族人扶到了王彩娥家的院子。金家族里受伤的人，分别被抬回了自己家里。金俊文衣服被扯得稀巴烂，手上流着血；他的小儿子已经被打得睡在土炕上直喊爹妈。金俊武大眼睛里充满了红丝，两只手分别拿着切菜刀和杀猪刀子，仍然僵立在自家的门口——他终于使王家庄的凶徒没有能进入家门。而他哥的家门却没能守住，攻进去了几个人；尽管俊文父子三人拼力作战，但家里还是被砸得一塌糊涂；水瓮，盆碗，没有一只是完好无缺的……现在，王家庄的二十来条后生已经淌过了东拉河，到田家圪崂寻田福堂的麻烦来了。田福堂做梦也不会想到，这股祸水会被引到他家！ \n　　这些打红了眼的人刚过了哭咽河的小桥，有人就跑到前面给田福堂传了话。福堂由于没任何精神准备，一时慌乱得不知如何是好。他先吼叫着让老婆和儿子赶快去邻居家避难；老婆和儿子走后，他又把窑洞的门都锁了起来。然后他飞快地跑到院墙外，吼叫田福高和田姓人家的后生们，赶快来保卫他的家庭！ \n　　以田福高为首的田姓人家的几十条后生，几乎和王家庄狂暴的后生们同时赶到了田福堂的院子里。 \n　　一场混战立刻又在这里展开了。王家几个捷足先登的人，已经爬上了田福堂家的窑顶，把窑檐石挨个地往下砸；碎石头顿时劈劈啪啪落在了院子里！ \n　　田\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田牛<|>PERSON<|>田牛 is a
