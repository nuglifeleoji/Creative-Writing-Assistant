And again, the mouse-thumping pecked its way across the sand.\nOnce more, the bird chirruped.\nThe troop resumed its climb up into a crack in the rocks, but there was a stillness of breath about the Fremen now that filled Paul with caution, and he noted covert glances toward Chani, the way she seemed to withdraw, pulling in upon herself.\nThere was rock underfoot now, a faint gray swishing of robes around them, and Paul sensed a relaxing of discipline, but still that quiet-of-the-person about Chani and the others. He followed a shadow Shape—up steps, a turn, more steps, into a tunnel, past two moisture-sealed doors and into a globelighted narrow passage with yellow rock walls and ceiling.\nAll around him, Paul saw the Fremen throwing back their hoods, removing nose plugs, breathing deeply. Someone sighed. Paul looked for Chani, found that she had left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies. Someone jostled him, said,\n“Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It’s always this Way.”\nOn his left, the narrow bearded face of the one called Farok turned toward Paul. The stained eyepits and blue darkness of eyes appeared even darker under the yellow globes. “Throw off your hood, Usul,” Farok said. “You’re home.” And he helped Paul, releasing the hood catch, elbowing a space around them.\nPaul slipped out his nose plugs, swung the mouth baffle aside. The odor of the place assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esthers of reclaimed wastes, everywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with, over it all, a turbulence of spice and spicelike harmonics.\n“Why are we waiting, Farok?” Paul asked.\n“For the Reverend Mother, | think. You heard the message—poor Chani.”\nPoor Chani? Paul asked himself. He looked around, wondering where she was, where his mother had got to in all this crush.\nFarok took a deep breath. “The smells of home,” he said.\nPaul saw that the man was enjoying the stink of this air, that there was no Irony in his tone. He heard his mother cough then, and her voice came back to him through the press of the troop: “How rich the odors of your sietch, Stilgar. | see you do much working with the spice...you make paper...plastics... and isn’t that chemical explosives?”\n“You know this from what you smell?” It was another man’s voice.\nAnd Paul realized she was speaking for his benefit that she wanted him to make a quick acceptance of this assault on his nostrils.\nThere came a buzz of activity at the head of the troop and a prolonged indrawn breath that seemed to pass through the Fremen, and Paul heard hushed voices back down the line: “It’s true then—Liet Is dead.”\nLiet, Paul thought. Then: Chani, daughter of Liet. The pieces fell together in his mind. Liet was the Fremen name of the planetologist.\nPaul looked at Farok, asked: “Is it the Liet known as Kynes?”\n“There is only one Liet,” Farok said.\nPaul turned, stared at the robed back of a Fremen in front of him. Then Liet-Kynes is dead, he thought.\n“It was Harkonnen treachery,” someone hissed. “They made it seem an accident...lost in the desert... a ‘thopter crash....”\nPaul felt a burst of anger. The man who had befriended them, helped save them from the Harkonnen hunters, the man who had sent his Fremen cohorts searching for two strays in the desert...another victim of the Harkonnens.\n“Does Usul hunger yet for revenge?” Farok asked.\nBefore Paul could answer, there came a low Call and the troop swept forward into a wider chamber, carrying Paul with them. He found himself in an open Space confronted by Stilgar and a strange woman wearing a flowing wraparound garment of brilliant Orange and green. Her arms were bare to the shoulders, and he could see she wore no stillSuit. Her\nSkin was a pale olive. Dark hair swept back from her high forehead, throwing emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose between the dense darkness of her eyes.\nShe turned toward him, and Paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies dangling from her ears.\n“This bested my Jamis?” she demanded.\n“Be silent, Harah,” Stilgar said. “It was Jamis’ doing—he invoked the tahaddi al-burhan.”\n“He’s not but a boy!” she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from side to side, setting the water tallies to jingling. “My children made fatherless by another child? Surely, ‘twas an accident!”\n“Usul, how many years have you?” Stilgar asked.\n“Fifteen Standard,” Paul said.\nStilgar swept his eyes over the troop. “Is there one among you cares to challenge me?”\nSilence.\nStilgar looked at the woman. “Until I’ve learned his weirding ways, I’d not challenge him.”\nShe returned his stare. “But—”\n“You saw the stranger woman who went with Chani to the Reverend Mother?” Stilgar asked. “She’s an out-freyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad. The mother and son are masters of the weirding ways of battle.”\n“Lisan al-Gaib,” the woman whispered. Her eyes held awe as she turned them back toward Paul.\nThe legend again, Paul thought.\n“Perhaps,” Stilgar said. “It hasn’t been tested, though.” He returned his attention to Paul. “Usul, it’s our way that you’ve now the responsibility for Jamis’\nwoman here and for his two sons. His yali...his quarters, are yours. His coffee service is yours...and this, his woman.”\nPaul studied the woman, wondering: Why isn’t she mourning her man? Why does she show no hate for me? Abruptly, he saw that the Fremen were staring at him, waiting.\nSomeone whispered: “There’s work to do. Say how you accept her.”\nStilgar said: “Do you accept Harah as woman or servant?”\nHarah lifted her arms, turning slowly on one heel. “Tam still young, Usul. It’s said I still look as young as when | was with Geoff...before Jamis bested him.”\nJamis killed another to win her, Paul thought.\nPaul said: “If | accept her as servant, may | yet change my mind at a later time?”\n“You'd have a year to change your decision,” Stilgar said. “After that, she’s a free woman to choose as she wishes...or you could free her to choose for herself at any time. But she’s your responsibility, no matter what, for one year...and you'll always share some responsibility for the sons of Jamis.”\n“I accept her as servant,” Paul said.\nHarah stamped a foot, shook her shoulders with anger. “But I’m young!”\nStilgar looked at Paul, said: “Caution’s a worthy trait in a man who'd lead.”\n“But I’m young!” Harah repeated.\n“Be silent,” Stilgar commanded. “If a thing has merit, it’ll be. Show Usul to his quarters and see he has fresh clothing and a place to rest.”\n“Oh-h-h-h!” she said.\nPaul had registered enough of her to have a first approximation. He felt the impatience of the troop, knew many things were being delayed here. He wondered if he dared ask the whereabouts of his mother and Chani, saw from Stilgar’s nervous stance that it would be a mistake.\nHe faced Harah, pitched his voice with tone and tremolo to accent her fear and awe, said: “Show me my quarters, Harah! We will discuss your youth another time.”\nShe backed away two steps, cast a frightened glance at Stilgar. “He has the weirding voice,” she husked.\n“Stilgar,” Paul said. “Chani’s father put heavy obligation on me. If there’s anything....”\n“It’ll be decided in council,” Stilgar said. “You can speak then.” He nodded in dismissal, turned away with the rest of the troop following him.\nPaul took Harah’s arm, noting how cool her flesh seemed, feeling her tremble. “I'll not harm you, Harah,” he said. “Show me our quarters.” And he smoothed his voice with relaxants.\n“You'll not cast me out when the year’s gone?” she said. “I know for true I’m not as young as once | was.”\n“As long as | live you'll have a place with me,” he said. He released her arm. “Come now, where are our quarters?”\nShe turned, led the way down the passage, turning right into a wide cross tunnel lighted by\nevenly spaced yellow overhead globes. The stone floor was smooth, swept clean of sand.\nPaul moved up beside her, studied the aquiline profile as they walked. “You do not hate me, Harah?”\n“Why should | hate you?”\nShe nodded to a cluster of children who stared at them from the raised ledge of a side passage. Paul glimpsed adult shapes behind the children partly hidden by filmy hangings.\n“T,..bested Jamis.”\n“Stilgar said the ceremony was held and you're a friend of Jamis.” She glanced sidelong at him. “Stilgar Said you gave moisture to the dead. Is that truth?”\n“Yes.”\n“It’s more than l'Il do...can do.”\n“Don’t you mourn him?”\n“In the time of mourning, l'Il mourn him.”\nThey passed an arched opening. Paul looked through it at men and women working with stand- mounted machinery in a large, bright chamber. There seemed an extra tempo of urgency to them.\n“What're they doing in there?” Paul asked.\nShe glanced back as they passed beyond the arch, said: “They hurry to finish the quota in the plastics shop before we flee. We need many dew collectors for the planting.”\n“Flee?”\n“Until the butchers stop hunting us or are driven from our land.”\nPaul caught himself in a stumble, sensing an arrested instant of time, remembering a fragment, a visual projection of prescience—but it was displaced,\nlike a montage in motion. The bits of his prescient memory were not quite as he remembered them.\n“The Sardaukar hunt us,” he said.\n“They'll not find much excepting an empty sietch or two,” she said. “And they'll find their share of death in the sand.”\n“They'll find this place?” he asked.\n“Likely.”\n“Yet we take the time to....” He motioned with his head toward the arch now far behind them. “... make...dew collectors?”\n“The planting goes on.”\n“What’re dew collectors?” he asked.\nThe glance she turned on him was full of Surprise. “Don’t they teach you anything in the...wherever it is you come from?”\n“Not about dew collectors.”\n“Hai!” she said, and there was a whole conversation in the one word.\n“Well, what are they?”\n“Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg,” she said, “how do you suppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted most tenderly in its own little pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns them white. You can see them glistening\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a desert-dwelling people with a strict code of conduct and deep cultural traditions, including the use of stillsuits and water conservation techniques.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is a fifteen-year-old boy who has recently joined the Fremen and is learning their ways.
