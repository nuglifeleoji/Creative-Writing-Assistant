Professionally, Loschy Teg held a position within the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles (CHOAM), though the exact nature of his role varies slightly across descriptions. Some sources identify him as a **CHOAM station factor**, implying a managerial or administrative role, while others refer to him as a **minor functionary**, suggesting a less prominent position.
