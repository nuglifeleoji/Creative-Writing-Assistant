She is described as a muscular woman with closely cropped blonde hair, often compared to Beast Rabban in her physicality, and carries a crysknife from Stilgar’s household as a talisman. Nayla serves multiple roles: she is assigned to escort and provide for Siona and Duncan Idaho at Tuono, while also acting as a spy for Leto, monitoring their activities and reporting directly to Moneo.  \n\nThough fanatically devoted to Leto and unwavering in her obedience to his commands, Nayla is conflicted about her duties, particularly when they involve Siona, whom she both guards and distrusts. She pretends to obey Siona while secretly furthering Leto’s agenda, even infiltrating the rebellion under Siona’s command. Nayla is cautious and vigilant, assisting in rebel activities and ensuring security during meetings, yet her true allegiance lies with the God Emperor.  \n\nHer relationship with Duncan Idaho is marked by tension; he perceives her as brutish and untrustworthy, a sentiment echoed by Siona, who questions Nayla’s motives. Despite this, Nayla is a disciplined and precise operative, involved in secret missions and wielding a lasgun when necessary. Her actions culminate in pivotal moments, including the killing of Hwi, which leads to her own death at the hands of Idaho.  \n\nNayla’s loyalty to Leto is absolute, yet her role as a double agent creates internal conflict.
