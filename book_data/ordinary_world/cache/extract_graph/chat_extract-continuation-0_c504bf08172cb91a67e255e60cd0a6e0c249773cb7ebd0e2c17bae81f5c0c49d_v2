��红梅的爱情有区别。孙少安和贺秀莲的爱情倒也没什么大波大折，他们是用汗水和心血一点一滴汇聚成了这深情的海洋……当我们怀着如此庄严的心情谈论少安和秀莲在痛苦中这美好感情的时候，不得不尴尬地宣布：由于他们频繁的两性生活使秀莲节育环出了点问题，结果让她怀上了娃娃。 \n　　嗨！这个孩子来得实在不是时候——而生活就常常开这种令人哭笑不得的玩笑。“把这个孩子打掉吧！”少安痛苦而温柔地对妻子说。“咱光景烂包成了这个样子，一无愁得人连头也抬不起来，怎有心思再抚养一个孩子呢？再说，咱又没有生二胎的指标！孩子出世后，连个户口也报不上，公家不承认，以后怎么办？”“不！我非要这个孩子不行！我早就想要个女儿了。再愁再苦，我也不怕。娃娃生下后，不要你管，我自己一个人拉扯，你放心…… \n　　“你这狠心的人！你怎能不要咱的骨肉呢？打掉？那你先把我杀了！公家不给上户口，咱的娃娃就不要！反正这娃娃是中国人，他们总不能撵到台湾去！” \n　　“台湾也是中国的……”少安苦笑着想纠正妻子。 \n　　孙少安扭不过秀莲的执拗，只好承认了这个现实——这意味着明年，他这个家就是四口人了！既然秀莲要这个孩子，少安和她一样，也希望是个女孩子，俗话说，一男一女活神仙！他们甚至在被离里已经给他们未来的“女儿”起了乳名——燕子。虎子、燕子，兄妹俩的名字怪美的！妻子怀孕后，实际上增加了少安的苦恼。多一个人，就多一张吃饭的嘴。当然，养活儿女们长大，他还是有信心的。可是，作为一个父亲，他的责任远不止于把孩子喂饱；他应该有所作为，使孩子在生活中感到保护他们成长的人是强大的，并为自己的父亲而感到自豪！他绝不能让他们象自己一样，看着父母的愁眉苦脸长大。他的虎子和燕子，无论在体格上，精神上和受教育方面，都不能让他们受到委屈和挫伤——这是他自己苦难生活经历所得出的血泪般的认识！ \n　　这一切都取决于他——取决于他倒究能在这个充满风险的世界上以什么样的面貌来生活。 \n　　唉，就眼下这种灰样子，孩子照样得跟上他倒霉！他已经感到，马上就要上小学的虎子，这一年来看见他和秀莲愁眉不展，也懂得为他们熬煎了。是呀，他自己到这个年龄的时候，已经明白了多少事；当时家庭悲剧性的生活他都看得一清二楚了。 \n　　孙少安万分痛苦！万分焦急！他是一个有些文化的人，常常较一般\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a character who is struggling with the
