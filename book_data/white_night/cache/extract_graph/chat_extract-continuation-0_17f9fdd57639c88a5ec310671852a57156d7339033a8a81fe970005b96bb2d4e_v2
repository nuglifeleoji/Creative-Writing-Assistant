   冰火相克，对于熔岩犬来说，显然是很讨厌这种低温攻击的，再加上冰雾的遮掩，它们前冲的速度顿时慢了许多。\n\n    “刘锋，过来！”蓝轩宇大叫一声，拉着钱磊就朝着刘锋的方向跑去。现在只有三人聚集在一起，才有机会面对这么多的敌人。钱磊释放了召唤之门之后，基本就相当于没啥用了。他需要一段时间恢复，才能再次召唤。\n\n    “你还要多久？”蓝轩宇扭头向自己拉拽着的钱磊问道。\n\n    钱磊一脸的无奈，“还要半分钟吧。刚刚那小猫没消耗我太多精神力和魂力。”\n\n    要不说他这武魂不靠谱呢，每次施展魂技，消耗会根据被召唤对象而定，这不确定性也是没谁了。\n\n    蓝轩宇嘴角一抽，他知道，要是想反败为胜，现在恐怕也只能是寄希望于钱磊能出奇迹，召唤出强大的魂兽才有可能了。\n\n    “我来啦！”刘锋化身一道白光，快速的朝着蓝轩宇和钱磊的方向冲了过来。他的速度不可谓不快，可是，似乎有点快过头了。\n\n    “停下。”眼看着那白色身影越来越近，却没有啥减速的意思，蓝轩宇赶忙大叫一声。\n\n    “我……”刘锋也想停，可之前为了跑，他已经是全速，一时之间竟是停不下来。\n\n    “砰——”\n\n    精准命中，三人撞在一起，顿时成了滚地葫芦。\n\n    蓝轩宇有点想哭，这都什么队友？难怪高能少年班就剩他们两个人一组，这绝对是全班里最不靠谱的了吧。哪怕是自己不喜欢的叶灵瞳，也要比他们靠谱多了啊！\n\n    而此时，熔岩犬已经围了上来。\n\n    “钱磊，准备召唤。我帮你撑一会儿。”蓝轩宇一边说着，左手迅速按在地面上，魂力全力以赴输出。\n\n    一根根粗大的冰刺骤然从地面上钻出，将三人的身体保护在内。\n\n    这些冰刺每根都长达一米开外，三人身体又小，有冰刺保护，顿时把外面的熔岩犬隔绝开来。\n\n    而蓝轩宇这一释放，自身的魂力顿时消耗了大半。毕竟，他才只是十几级而已啊！\n\n    几只熔岩犬速度太快，冲上来，顿时被冰刺刺中，“嗷嗷”惨叫着后退。除了被蓝轩宇先前冰锥射中眼睛那只之外，整整四十九只熔岩犬围在外面，犬视眈眈，不断的发出嘶吼。但也终于止住了攻击，毕竟，它们\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
