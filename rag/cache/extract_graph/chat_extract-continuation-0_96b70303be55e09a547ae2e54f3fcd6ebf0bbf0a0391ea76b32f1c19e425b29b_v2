Later!” Odrade knew she was feeling peckish and it had come out in the response to Bell’s pertinent question. Pressures confined the Mother Superior more and more these days. She had always tried to face her duties with an\nattitude of broad interest. The more things to interest her, the wider her scan and that was sure to bring more usable data. Using the senses improved them. Substance, that was what her questing interests desired. Substance. It was like hunting for food to assuage a deep hunger.\nBut her days were becoming duplicates of this morning. Her liking for personal inspections was well known but these workroom walls held her. She must be where she could be reached. Not only reached, but able to dispatch communications and people on the instant.\nDamn! I will make the time. | must!\nIt was time pressure as much as anything.\nSheeana said: “We trundle along on borrowed days.”\nVery poetic! Not much help in the face of pragmatic demands. They had to get as many Bene Gesserit cells as possible Scattered before the axe fell. Nothing else had that\npriority. The Bene Gesserit fabric was being torn apart, sent to destinations no one on Chapterhouse could know. Sometimes, Odrade saw this flow as rags and remnants. They went flapping away in their no-ships, a stock of sandtrout in their holds, Bene Gesserit traditions, learning and memories as guide. But the Sisterhood had done this long ago in the first Scattering and none came back or sent a message. Not one. Not one. Only Honored Matres returned. If they had ever been Bene Gesserit, they now were a terrible distortion, blindly suicidal.\nWill we ever be whole again?\nOdrade looked down at the work on her table: more selection charts. Who shall go and who shall remain? There was little time to pause and take a deep breath. Other Memory from her late predecessor, Taraza, took on an “I told you so!” character. “See what | had to go through?”\nAnd I once wondered if there was room at the top.\nThere might be room at the top (as she was fond of telling acolytes) but there was seldom enough time.\nWhen she thought of the largely passive non-Bene Gesserit populace “out there,” Odrade sometimes envied them. They were permitted their illusions. What a comfort. You could pretend your life was forever, that tomorrow would be better, that the gods in their heavens watched you with care.\nShe recoiled from this lapse with disgust at herself. The unclouded eye was better, no matter what it saw.\n“I’ve studied the latest Idaho records,” she said, looking across the table at the patient Bellonda.\n“He has interesting instincts,” Bellonda said.\nOdrade thought about that. Comeyes throughout the no- ship missed little. The Council’s theory about ghola-Ildaho became daily less a theory and more a conviction. How many memories from the serial Idaho lifetimes did this ghola contain?\n“Tam is raising doubts about their children,” Bellonda said. “Do they have dangerous talents?”\nThat was to be expected. The three children Murbella had borne Idaho in the no-ship had been removed at birth. All were being observed with care as they developed. Did they have that uncanny reactive speed Honored Matres displayed? Too early to say. It was a thing that developed in puberty, according to Murbella.\nTheir captive Honored Matre accepted the removal of her children with angry resignation. Idaho, however, showed little reaction. Odd. Did something give him a broader view of procreation? Almost a Bene Gesserit view?\n“Another Bene Gesserit breeding program,” he sneered.\nOdrade let her thoughts flow. Was it really the Bene Gesserit attitude they saw in Idaho? The Sisterhood said emotional attachments were ancient detritus—important for human survival in their day but no longer required in the Bene Gesserit plan.\nInstincts.\nThings that came with egg and sperm. Often vital and loud: “This is the species talking to you, dolt!”\nLoves... offspring... hungers... All of those unconscious motives to compel specific behavior. It was dangerous to meddle in such matters. The Breeding Mistresses knew this even while they did it. The Council debated it periodically and ordered a careful watch on consequences.\n“You’ve studied the records. Is that all the answer | get?” Quite plaintive for Bellonda.\nThe comeye record of such interest to Bell was of Idaho questioning Murbella about Honored Matre sexual-addiction techniques. Why? His parellel abilities came from Tleilaxu conditioning impressed on his cells in the axlotl tank. Idaho’s abilities originated as an unconscious pattern akin to instincts but the result was indistinguishable from the\nHonored Matre effect: ecstasy amplified until it drove out all reason and bound its victims to the source of such rewards. Murbella went only so far in a verbal exploration of her abilities. Obvious residual fury that Idaho had addicted her\nwith the same techniques she had been taught to use.\n“Murbella blocks up when Idaho questions motives,” Bellonda said.\nYes, I’ve seen that.\n“I could kill you and you know it!” Murbella had said.\nThe comeye record showed them in bed in Murbella’s no- ship quarters, having just satiated their mutual addiction. Sweat glistened on bare flesh. Murbella lay with a blue towel across her forehead, green eyes staring up at the comeyes. She appeared to be looking directly at the observers. Little orange flecks in her eyes. Anger flecks from her body’s residual store of the spice substitute Honored Matres employed. She was on melange now—and no adverse symptoms.\nIdaho lay beside her, black hair in disarray around his face, a sharp contrast to the white pillow beneath his head. His eyes were closed but the lids flickered. Thin. He wasn’t eating enough despite tempting dishes sent by Odrade’s own chef. His high cheekbones were strongly defined. The face had become craggy in the years of his confinement.\nMurbella’s threat was backed by physical ability, Odrade knew, but it was psychologically false. Ki// her lover? Not likely!\nBellonda was thinking along these same lines. “What was she doing when she demonstrated her physical speed? We've seen that before.”\n“She knows we watch.”\nThe comeyes showed Murbella defying post-coital fatigue to leap from bed. Moving with blurred speed (much faster than anything the Bene Gesserit had ever achieved), she kicked out with her right foot, stopping the blow only a hair’s breadth from Idaho’s head.\nAt her first movement, Idaho opened his eyes. He watched without fear, without flinching.\nThat blow! Fatal if it struck. You had only to see sucha thing once to fear it. Murbella moved with no resort to her central cortex. Insect-like, an attack triggered by nerves at the point of muscle ignition.\n“You see!” Murbella lowered her foot and glared down at him.\nIdaho smiled.\nWatching it, Odrade reminded herself that the Sisterhood had three of Murbella’s children, all female. The Breeding Mistresses were excited. In time, Reverend Mothers born of this line might match that Honored Matre ability.\nIn time we probably don’t have.\nBut Odrade shared the excitement of the Breeding Mistresses. That speed! Add that to the nerve-muscle training, the great pranabindu resources of the Sisterhood! What that might create lay wordlessly within her.\n“She did that for us, not for him,” Bellonda said.\nOdrade was not sure. Murbella resented the constant watch over her but she had come to an accommodation with it. Many of her actions obviously ignored the people behind the comeyes. This record showed her returning to her place in the bed beside Idaho.\n“I have restricted access to that record,” Bellonda said. “Some acolytes are becoming troubled.”\nOdrade nodded. Sexual addiction. That aspect of Honored Matre abilities created disturbing ripples in the Bene Gesserit, especially among acolytes. Very suggestive. And most of the Sisters on Chapterhouse knew the Reverend Mother Sheeana, alone among them, practiced some of these techniques in defiance of a general fear this could weaken them.\n“We must not become Honored Matres!” Bell was always saying that. But Sheeana represents a significant control factor. She teaches us something about Murbella.\nOne afternoon, catching Murbella alone in her no-ship quarters and obviously relaxed, Odrade had tried a direct question. “Before Idaho, were none of you ever tempted to, let us Say, ‘join in the fun’?”\nMurbella had recoiled with angry pride. “He caught me by accident!”\nThe same kind of anger she showed to Idaho’s questions. Remembering this, Odrade leaned over her worktable and called up the original record.\n“Look at how angry she gets,” Bellonda said. “A hypnotrance injunction against answering such questions. I'd stake my reputation on it.”\n“That'll come out in the Spice Agony,” Odrade said.\n“If she ever gets to it!”\n“Hypnotrance is supposed to be our secret.”\nBellonda chewed on the obvious inference. No Sister we sent out in the original Scattering ever returned.\nIt was written large in their minds: “Did renegade Bene Gesserit create the Honored Matres?” Much suggested it. Then why did they resort to sexual enslavement of males? Murbella’s historical prattlings did not satisfy. Everything about this went against Bene Gesserit teaching.\n“We have to learn,” Bellonda insisted. “What little we know is very disturbing.”\nOdrade recognized the concern. How much of a lure was this ability? Very big, she thought. Acolytes complained that they dreamed about becoming Honored Matres. Bellonda was rightly worried.\nCreate or arouse such unbridled forces and you built carnal fantasies of enormous complexity. You could lead whole populations around by their desires, by their fantasy projections.\nThere was the terrible power the Honored Matres dared use. Let it be known that they had the key to blinding ecstasy and they had won half the battle. The simple clue that such a thing existed, that was the beginning of\nsurrender. People at Murbella’s level in that other Sisterhood might not understand this but the ones at the top... Was it possible they merely used this power without caring or even suspecting its deeper force? /f that were the case, how were our first Scattered Ones lured into this dead end?\nEarlier, Bellonda had offered her hypothesis:\nHonored Matre with captive Reverend Mother taken prisoner in that first Scattering. “Welcome, Reverend Mother. We would like you to witness a small demonstration of our powers.” Interlude of sexual demonstration followed by a display of Honred Matre physical speed. Then— withdrawal of melange and injection of the adrenaline-based substitute laced with a hypnodrug. In that hypothetical trance, the Reverend Mother was sexually imprinted.\nThat coupled to the selective agony of melange withdrawal (Bell suggested) might make the victim deny her Origins.\nFates help us! Were the original Honored Matres all Reverend Mothers? Do we dare test this hypothesis on ourselves? What can we learn of this from that pair in the no-ship?\nTwo sources of information lay there under the Sisterhood’s watchful eyes but the key had yet to be found.\nWoman and man no longer just breeding partners, no longer a comfort and support to each other. Something new has been added. The stakes have been escalated.\nIn the comeye record playing at the work\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BELLONDA<|>PERSON<|>Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit who interacts with Odrade and discusses Idaho and Murbella's records and behaviors.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is the Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, dealing with pressures and decisions about the Sisterhood's survival.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEEANA<|>PERSON<|>Sheeana is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who practices Honored Matre techniques and represents a control factor.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURBELLA<|>PERSON<|>Murbella is a captive Honored Matre who has children with Idaho and displays unique physical abilities.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Idaho is a ghola with Tleilaxu conditioning, involved with Murbella and under Bene Gesserit observation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARAZA<|>PERSON<|>Taraza is Odrade's late predecessor whose memories influence Odrade's decisions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful Sisterhood facing existential threats and planning a Scattering.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a feared group with superior abilities, possibly originating from Bene Gesserit renegades.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapterhouse is the planet where the Bene Gesserit are based and making critical decisions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location in Tiruzia where Samuel Namara was held.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTERING<|>EVENT<|>The Scattering is a planned dispersal of Bene Gesserit cells to ensure survival against the Honored Matres.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BELLONDA<|>Odrade and Bellonda collaborate on analyzing Idaho and Murbella's records and behaviors.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SHEEANA<|>Odrade considers Sheeana's practices as a control factor in understanding Honored Matre techniques.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>MURBELLA<|>Odrade oversees Murbella's captivity and studies her abilities for Bene Gesserit advantage.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>IDAHO<|>Odrade monitors Idaho's behavior and potential as part of Bene Gesserit plans.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>TARAZA<|>Odrade accesses Taraza's memories for guidance in her leadership role.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Odrade leads the Bene Gesserit and makes critical decisions for its survival.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SCATTERING<|>Odrade is orchestrating the Scattering to save the Bene Gesserit from destruction.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>MURBELLA<|>Bellonda analyzes Murbella's behaviors and abilities for Bene Gesserit research.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELLONDA<|>IDAHO<|>Bellonda studies Idaho's records and instincts for Bene Gesserit purposes.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEEANA<|>MURBELLA<|>Sheeana's practices provide insights into Murbella's Honored Matre abilities.<|>5\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURBELLA<|>IDAHO<|>Murbella and Idaho share a complex relationship involving addiction and mutual observation.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Bene Gesserit are threatened by and seek to understand the Honored Matres.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>SCATTERING<|>The Bene Gesserit are organizing the Scattering to escape Honored Matre destruction.<|>9\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
