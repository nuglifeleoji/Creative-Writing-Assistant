Then: “Hold your tongues, both of you!”\nAlia’s bronze hair was pulled back into two golden water rings. Her oval face held a frown, the wide mouth with its downturned hint of self-indulgence was held in a tight line. Worry wrinkles fanned the corners of her blue-on-blue eyes.\n“I’ve warned both of you how to behave today,” Alia said. “You know the reasons as well as I.”\n“We know your reasons, but you may not know ours,” Ghanima said.\n“Ghani!” Alia growled.\nLeto glared at his aunt, said: “Today of all days, we will not pretend to be simpering infants!”\n“No one wants you to simper,” Alia said. “But we think it unwise for you to provoke dangerous thoughts in my mother. Irulan agrees with me. Who knows what role the Lady Jessica will choose? She is, after all, Bene Gesserit.”\nLeto shook his head, wondering: Why does Alia not see what we suspect? Is she too far gone? And he made special note of the subtle gene-markers on Alia’s face which betrayed the presence of her maternal grandfather. The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen had not been a pleasant person.\nAt this observation, Leto felt the vague stirrings of his own disquiet, thinking: My own ancestor, too.\nHe said: “The Lady Jessica was trained to rule.”\nGhanima nodded. “Why does she choose this time to come back?”\nAlia scowled. Then: “Is it possible she merely wants to see her grandchildren?”\nGhanima thought: That’s what you hope, my dear aunt. But it’s damned well not likely.\n“She cannot rule here,” Alia said. “She has Caladan. That Should be enough.”\nGhanima spoke placatingly: “When our father went into the desert to die, he left you as Regent. He...”\n“Have you any complaint?” Alia demanded.\n“It was a reasonable choice,” Leto said, following his sister’s lead. “You were the one person who knew what it was like to be born as we were born.”\n“It’s rumored that my mother has returned to the Sisterhood,” Alia said, “and you both know what the Bene Gesserit think about... .”\n“Abomination,” Leto said.\n“Yes!” Alia bit the word off.\n“Once a witch, always a witch—so it’s said,” Ghanima said.\nSister, you play a dangerous game, Leto thought, but he followed her lead, saying: “Our grandmother was a woman of greater simplicity than others of her kind. You share her memories, Alia; surely you must know what to expect.”\n“Simplicity!” Alia said, shaking her head, looking around her at the thronged passage, then back to the twins. “If my mother were less complex, neither of you would be here— nor I. | would have been her firstborn and none of this... .” A shrug, half shudder, moved her shoulders. “I warn you two, be very careful what you do today.” Alia looked up. “Here comes my guard.”\n“And you still don’t think it safe for us to accompany you to the spaceport?” Leto asked.\n“Wait here,” Alia said. “lIl bring her back.”\nLeto exchanged a look with his sister, said: “You’ve told us many times that the memories we hold from those who’ve passed before us lack a certain usefulness until we’ve experienced enough with our own flesh to make them reality. My sister and I believe this. We anticipate dangerous changes with the arrival of our grandmother.”\n“Don’t stop believing that,” Alia said. She turned away to be enclosed by her guards and they moved swiftly down the passage toward the State Entrance where ornithopters awaited them.\nGhanima wiped a tear from her right eye.\n“Water for the dead?” Leto whispered, taking his sister’s arm.\nGhanima drew in a deep, sighing breath, thinking of how she had observed her aunt, using the way she knew best from her own accumulation of ancestral experiences. “Spice trance did it?” she asked, knowing what Leto would say.\n“Do you have a better suggestion?”\n“For the sake of argument, why didn’t our father... or even our grandmother succumb?”\nHe studied her a moment. Then: “You know the answer as well as | do. They had secure personalities by the time they came to Arrakis. The spice trance—well . . .” He shrugged. “They weren’t born into this world already possessed of their ancestors. Alia, though...”\n“Why didn’t she believe the Bene Gesserit warnings?” Ghanima chewed her lower lip. “Alia had the same information to draw upon that we do.”\n“They already were calling her Abomination,” Leto said. “Don’t you find it tempting to find out if you’re stronger than all of those...”\n“No, | don’t!” Ghanima looked away from her brother’s probing stare, shuddered. She had only to consult her\ngenetic memories and the Sisterhood’s warnings took on vivid shape. The pre-born observably tended to become adults of nasty habits. And the likely cause... Again she shuddered.\n“Pity we don’t have a few pre-born in our ancestry,” Leto said.\n“Perhaps we do.”\n“But we'd... Ahh, yes, the old unanswered question: Do we really have open access to every ancestor’s total file of experiences?”\nFrom his own inner turmoil, Leto knew how this conversation must be disturbing his sister. They’d considered this question many times, always without conclusion. He said: “We must delay and delay and delay every time she urges the trance upon us. Extreme caution with a spice overdose; that’s our best course.”\n“An overdose would have to be pretty large,” Ghanima said.\n“Our tolerance is probably high,” he agreed. “Look how much Alia requires.”\n“| pity her,” Ghanima said. “The lure of it must’ve been subtle and insidious, creeping up on her until...”\n“She’s a victim, yes,” Leto said. “Abomination.”\n“We could be wrong.”\n“True.”\n“I always wonder,” Ghanima mused, “if the next ancestral memory | seek will be the one which.. .”\n“The past is no farther away than your pillow,” Leto said.\n“We must make the opportunity to discuss this with our grandmother.”\n“So her memory within me urges,” Leto said.\nGhanima met his gaze. Then: “Too much knowledge never makes for simple decisions.”\nThe sietch at the desert’s rim Was Liet’s, was Kynes’s, Was Stilgar’s, was Muad’Dib’s And, once more, was Stilgar’s. The Naibs one by one sleep in the sand, But the sietch endures.\n—FROM A FREMEN SONG\nlia felt her heart pounding as she walked away from the\ntwins. For a few pulsing seconds, she had felt herself near compulsion to stay with them and beg their help. What a foolish weakness! Memory of it sent a warning stillness through Alia. Would these twins dare practice prescience? The path which had engulfed their father must lure the m— spice trance with its visions of the future wavering like gauze blown on a fickle wind.\nWhy cannot I see the future? Alia wondered. Much as I try, why does it elude me?\nThe twins must be made to try, she told herself. They could be lured into it. They had the curiosity of children and it was linked to memories which traversed millennia.\nJust as | have, Alia thought.\nHer guards opened the moisture seals at the State Entrance of the sietch, stood aside as she emerged onto the landing lip where the ornithopters waited. There was a wind from the desert blowing dust across the sky, but the day was bright. Emerging from the glowglobes of the sietch into the daylight sent her thoughts outward.\nWhy was the Lady Jessica returning at this moment? Had stories been carried to Caladan, stories of how the Regency was...\n“We must hurry, My Lady,” one of her guards said, raising his voice above the wind sounds.\nAlia allowed herself to be helped into her ornithopter and secured the safety harness, but her thoughts went leaping ahead.\nWhy now?\nAs the ornithopter’s wings dipped and the craft went Skidding into the air, she felt the pomp and power of her position as physical things—but they were fragile, oh, how fragile!\nWhy now, when her plans were not completed?\nThe dust mists drifted, lifting, and she could see the bright sunlight upon the changing landscape of the planet: broad reaches of green vegetation where parched earth had once dominated.\nWithout a vision of the future, | could fail. Oh, what magic | could perform if only | could see as Paul saw! Not for me the bitterness which prescient visions brought.\nA tormenting hunger shuddered through her and she wished she could put aside the power. Oh, to be as others were—blind in that safest of all blindnesses, living only the hypnoidal half-life into which birth-shock precipitated most humans. But no! She had been born an Atreides, victim of that eons-deep awareness inflicted by her mother’s spice addiction.\nWhy does my mother return today?\nGurney Halleck would be with her—ever the devoted servant, the hired killer of ugly mien, loyal and straightforward, a musician who played murder with a Sliptip, or entertained with equal ease upon his nine-string baliset. Some said he’d become her mother’s lover. That would be a thing to ferret out; it might prove a most valuable leverage.\nThe wish to be as others were left her.\nLeto must be lured into the spice trance.\nShe recalled asking the boy how he would deal with Gurney Halleck. And Leto, sensing undercurrents in her question, had said Halleck was loyal “to a fault,” adding: “He adored... my father.”\nShe’d noted the small hesitation. Leto had almost said “me” instead of “my father.” Yes, it was hard at times to separate the genetic memory from the chord of living flesh. Gurney Halleck would not make that separation easier for Leto.\nA harsh smile touched Alia’s lips.\nGurney had chosen to return to Caladan with the Lady Jessica after Paul’s death. His return would tangle many things. Coming back to Arrakis, he would add his own complexities to the existing lines. He had served Paul’s father—and thus the succession went: Leto | to Paul to Leto Il. And out of the Bene Gesserit breeding program: Jessica to Alia to Ghanima—a branching line. Gurney, adding to the confusion of identities, might prove valuable.\nWhat would he do if he discovered we carry the blood of Harkonnens, the Harkonnens he hates so bitterly?\nThe smile on Alia’s lips became introspective. The twins were, after all, children. They were like children with countless parents, whose memories belonged both to others and to self. They would stand\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a2071f3d7aabe52ef66ba8a642c619783f1b9a9d5e7b728fb28978fab414d9a8_v2"}
