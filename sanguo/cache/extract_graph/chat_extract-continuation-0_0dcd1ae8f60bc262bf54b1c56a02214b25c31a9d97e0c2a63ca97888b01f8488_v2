   于是永昌太守王伉出城迎接孔明。孔明入城已毕，问曰：“谁与公守此城，以保无虞？”伉曰：“某今日得此郡无危者，皆赖永昌不韦人，姓吕，名凯，字季平。皆此人之力。”孔明遂请目凯至。凯入见，礼毕。孔明曰：“久闻公乃永昌高士，多亏公保守此城。今欲平蛮方，公有何高见？”吕凯遂取一图，呈与孔明曰：“某自历仕以来，知南人欲反久矣，故密遣人入其境，察看可屯兵交战之处，画成一图，名曰《平蛮指掌图》。今敢献与明公。明公试观之，可为征蛮之一助也。”孔明大喜，就用吕凯为行军教授，兼向导官。于是孔明提兵大进，深入南蛮之境。正行军之次，忽报天子差使命至。孔明请入中军，但见一人素袍白衣而进，乃马谡也——为兄马良新亡，因此挂孝。——谡曰：“奉主上敕命，赐众军酒帛。”孔明接诏已毕，依命一一给散，遂留马谡在帐叙\n######################\nOutput:",
