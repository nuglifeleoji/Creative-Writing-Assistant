超辞了彭羕，即将人与书解见汉中王，细言其事。玄德大怒，即令擒彭羕下狱，拷问其情。羕在狱中，悔之无及。玄德问孔明曰：“彭羕有谋反之意，当何以治之？”孔明曰：“羕虽狂士，然留之久必生祸。”于是玄德赐彭羕死于狱。\n\n    羕既死，有人报知孟达。达大惊，举止失措。忽使命至，调刘封回守绵竹去讫。孟达慌请上庸、房陵都尉申耽、申仪弟兄二人商议曰：“我与法孝直同有功于汉中王；今孝直已死，而汉中王忘我前功，乃欲见害，为之奈何？“耽曰：“某有一计，使汉中王不能加害于公。”达大喜，急问何计。耽曰：“吾弟兄欲投魏久矣，公可作一表，辞了汉中王，投魏王曹丕，丕必重用。吾二人亦随后来降也。”达猛然省悟，即写表一通，付与来使；当晚引五十余骑投魏去了。\n\n    使命持表回成都，奏汉中王，言孟达投魏之事。先主大怒。览其表曰：“臣达伏惟殿下将建伊、吕之业，追桓、文之功，大事草创，假势吴、楚，是以有为之士，望风归顺。臣委质以来，愆戾山积；臣犹自知，况于君乎？今王朝英俊鳞集，臣内无辅佐之器，外无将领之才，列次功臣，诚足自愧！臣闻范蠡识微，浮于五湖；舅犯谢罪，逡巡河上。夫际会之间，请命乞身，何哉？欲洁去就之分也。况臣卑鄙，无元功巨勋，自系于时，窃慕前贤，早思远耻。昔申生至孝，见疑于亲；子胥至忠，见诛于君；蒙恬拓境而被大刑，乐毅破齐而遭谗佞。臣每读其书，未尝不感慨流涕；而亲当其事，益用伤悼！迩者，荆州覆败，大臣失节，百无一还；惟臣寻事，自致房陵、上庸，而复乞身，自放于外。伏想殿下圣恩感悟，愍臣之心，悼臣之举。臣诚小人，不能始终。知而为之，敢谓非罪？臣每闻交绝无恶声，去臣无怨辞，臣过奉教于君子，愿君王勉之，臣不胜惶恐之至！”玄德看毕，大怒曰：“匹夫叛吾，安敢以文辞相戏耶！”即欲起兵擒之。孔明曰：“可就遣刘封进兵，令二虎相并；刘封或有功，或败绩，必归成都，就而除之，可绝两害。玄德从之，遂遣使到绵竹，传谕刘封。封受命，率兵来擒孟达。却说曹丕正聚文�\n######################\nOutput:",
