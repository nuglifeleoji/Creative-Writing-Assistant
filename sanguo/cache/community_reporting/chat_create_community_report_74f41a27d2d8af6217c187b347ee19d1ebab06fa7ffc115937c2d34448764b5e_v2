Throughout his reign, he faced significant challenges, particularly from powerful warlords such as Cao Cao and the earlier threat posed by Dong Zhuo.\n\nCao Cao, in particular, played a crucial role in献帝's life, often manipulating him for his own political gain. Despite being the emperor,献帝 expressed concerns about the ongoing power struggles within the court and the looming threats from these warlords. His position was precarious, as he was frequently in danger, necessitating protection from his loyal officials. \n\nAt one point,献帝 was nearly assassinated by the warlords Li Jue and Guo Si.
