No wallets of currency would ever be produced here. The closest thing might be a thin case of translux out of whose poison-guarded interior would come thinner sheets of ridulian crystal with very large numbers inscribed on them by unforgeable dataprint.\n“This is a bank,” Teg said.\n“What?” Muzzafar had been staring at the closed door in the opposite wall. “Oh, yes. She’ll be along presently.”\n“She is watching us now, of course.”\nMuzzafar did not answer but he looked gloomy.\nTeg glanced around him. Had anything been changed since his previous visit? He saw no significant alterations. He wondered if shrines such as this one had undergone much change at all over the eons. There was a dewcarpet on the floor as soft as brantdown and as white as the underbelly of a fur whale. It shimmered with a false sense of wetness that only the eye detected. A bare foot (not that this place had ever seen a bare foot) would feel caressing dryness.\nThere was a narrow table about two meters long almost in the center of the room. The top was at least twenty\nmillimeters thick. Teg guessed it was Danian jacaranda. The deep brown surface had been polished to a sheen that drank the vision and revealed far underneath veins like river currents. There were only four admiral’s chairs around the table, chairs crafted by a master artisan from the same wood as the table, cushioned on seat and back with lyrleather of the exact tone of the polished wood.\nOnly four chairs. More would have been an overstatement. He had not tried one of the chairs before and he did not seat himself now, but he knew what his flesh would find there—comfort almost up to the level of a despised chairdog. Not quite at that degree of softness and conformity to bodily shape, of course. Too much comfort could lure the sitter into relaxation. This room and its furnishings said: “Be comfortable here but remain alert.”\nYou not only had to have your wits about you in this place but also a great power of violence behind you, Teg thought. He had summed it up that way before and his opinion had not changed.\nThere were no windows but the ones he had seen from the outside had danced with lines of light—energy barriers to repel intruders and prevent escape. Such barriers brought their own dangers, Teg knew, but the implications were important. Just keeping the energy flow in them would feed a large city for the lifetime of its longest-lived inhabitant.\nThere was nothing casual about this display of wealth.\nThe door that Muzzafar watched opened with a gentle click.\nDanger!\nA woman in a shimmering golden robe swept into the room. Lines of red-orange danced in the fabric.\nShe is old!\nTeg had not expected her to be this ancient. Her face was a wrinkled mask. The eyes were deeply set green ice. Her nose was an elongated beak whose shadow touched thin\nlips and repeated the sharp angle of the chin. A black Skullcap almost covered her gray hair.\nMuzzafar bowed.\n“Leave us,” she said.\nHe left without a word, going out through the door by which she had entered. When the door closed behind him, Teg said, “Honored Matre.”\n“So you recognize this as a bank.” Her voice carried only a Slight trembling.\n“Of course.”\n“There are always means of transferring large sums or selling power,” she said. “I do not speak of the power that runs factories but of the power that runs people.”\n“And that usually passes under the strange names of government or society or civilization,” Teg said.\n“I suspected you would be very intelligent,” she said. She pulled out a chair and sat but did not indicate that Teg should seat himself. “I think of myself as a banker. That saves a lot of muddy and distressful circumlocutions.”\nTeg did not respond. There seemed no need. He continued to study her.\n“Why are you looking at me like that?” she demanded.\n“| did not expect you to be this old,” he said.\n“Heh, heh, heh. We have many surprises for you, Bashar. Later, a younger Honored Matre may murmur her name to mark you. Praise Dur if that happens.”\nHe nodded, not understanding much of what she said.\n“This is also a very old building,” she said. “I watched you when you came in. Does that surprise you, too?”\n“No.”\n“This building has remained essentially unchanged for several thousand years. It is built of materials that will last much longer still.”\nHe glanced at the table.\n“Oh, not the wood. But underneath, it’s polastine, polaz, and pormabat. The three P-Os are never sneered at where\nnecessity calls for them.”\nTeg remained silent.\n“Necessity,” she said. “Do you object to any of the necessary things that have been done to you?”\n“My objections don’t matter,” he said. What was she getting at? Studying him, of course. As he studied her.\n“Do you think others have ever objected to what you did to them?”\n“Undoubtedly.”\n“You're a natural commander, Bashar. | think you’ll be very valuable to us.”\n“I’ve always thought | was most valuable to myself.”\n“Bashar! Look at my eyes!”\nHe obeyed, seeing little flecks of orange drifting in across the whites. The sense of peril was acute.\n“If you ever see my eyes fully orange, beware!” she said. “You will have offended me beyond my ability to tolerate.”\nHe nodded.\n“I like it that you can command but you cannot command me! You command the muck and that is the only function we have for such as you.”\n“The muck?”\nShe waved a hand, a negligent motion. “Out there. You know them. Their curiosity is narrow gauge. No great issues ever enter their awareness.”\n“I thought that was what you meant.”\n“We work to keep it that way,” she said. “Everything goes to them through a tight filter, which excludes all but that which has immediate survival value.”\n“No great issues,” he said.\n“You are offended but it doesn’t matter,” she said. “To those out there, a great issue is: ‘Will | eat today?’ ‘Do | have shelter tonight that will not be invaded by attackers or vermin?’ Luxury? Luxury is the possession of a drug ora member of the opposite sex who can, for a time, keep the beast at bay.”\nAnd you are the beast, he thought.\n“I am taking some time with you, Bashar, because | see that you could be more valuable to us even than Muzzafar. And he is extremely valuable indeed. Even now, we are repaying him for bringing you to us in a receptive condition.”\nWhen Teg still remained silent, she chuckled. “You do not think you are receptive?”\nTeg held himself quiet. Had they given him some drug in his food? He saw the flickering of doubled vision but the movements of violence had receded as the orange flecks left the Honored Matre’s eyes. Her feet were to be avoided, though. They were deadly weapons.\n“It’s just that you think of the muck in the wrong way,” she said. “Luckily, they are most self-limiting. They know this somewhere in the damps of their deepest consciousness but cannot spare the time to deal with that or anything else except the immediate scramble for survival.”\n“They cannot be improved?” he asked.\n“They must not be improved! Oh, we see to it that self- improvement remains a great fad among them. Nothing real about it, of course.”\n“Another luxury they must be denied,” he said.\n“Not a luxury! Nonexistent! It must be occluded at all times behind a barrier that we like to call protective ignorance.”\n“What you don’t know cannot hurt you.”\n“I don’t like your tone, Bashar.”\nAgain, the orange flecks danced in her eyes. The sense of violence diminished, however, as she once more chuckled. “The thing you beware of is the opposite of what-you-don’t- know. We teach that new knowledge can be dangerous. You see the obvious extension: All new knowledge is non- Survival!”\nThe door behind the Honored Matre opened and Muzzafar returned. It was a changed Muzzafar, his face flushed, his\neyes bright. He stopped behind the Honored Matre’s chair.\n“One day, | will be able to permit you behind me this way,” she said. “It is in my power to do this.”\nWhat had they done to Muzzafar? Teg wondered. The man looked almost drugged.\n“You do see that | have power?” she asked.\nHe cleared his throat. “That’s obvious.”\n“Lam a banker, remember? We have just made a deposit with our loyal Muzzafar. Do you thank us, Muzzafar?”\n“|I do, Honored Matre.” His voice was hoarse.\n“I’m sure you understand this kind of power generally, Bashar,” she said. “The Bene Gesserit trained you well. They are quite talented but not, | fear, as talented as we are,”\n“And | am told you are quite numerous,” he said.\n“Our numbers are not the key, Bashar. Power such as ours has a way of becoming channeled so that it can be controlled by small numbers.”\nShe was like a Reverend Mother, he thought, in the way she could appear to answer without revealing much.\n“In essence,” she said, “power such as ours is allowed to become the substance of survival for many people. Then, the threat of withdrawal is all that’s required for us to rule.” She glanced over her shoulder. “Would you wish us to withdraw our favor from you, Muzzafar?”\n“No, Honored Matre.” He was actually trembling!\n“You have found a new drug,” Teg said.\nHer laughter was spontaneous and loud, almost raucous. “No, Bashar! We have an old one.”\n“And you would make an addict of me?”\n“Like all the others we control, Bashar, you have a choice: death or obedience.”\n“That is a rather old choice,” he agreed. What was her immediate threat? He could sense no violence. Quite the contrary. His doubled vision showed him broken glimpses of\nextremely sensuous overtones. Did they think they could imprint him?\nShe smiled at him, a knowing expression with something frigid under it.\n“Will he serve us well, Muzzafar?”\n“| believe so, Honored Matre.”\nTeg frowned in thought. There was something deeply evil about this pair. They went against every morality by which he modeled his behavior. It was well to remember that neither of them knew this strange thing that had speeded his reactions.\nThey seemed to be enjoying his puzzled discomfiture.\nTeg took some reassurance from the realization that neither of these two really enjoyed life. He could see that in them clearly with eyes the Sisterhood had educated. The Honored Matre and Muzzafar had forgotten or, most likely, abandoned everything that supported the survival of joyous humans. He thought they probably no longer were capable of finding a real wellspring of joy in their own flesh. Theirs would have to be mostly a voyeur’s existence, the eternal observer, always remembering what it had been like before they had taken the turning into whatever it was they had become. Even when they wallowed in the performance of something that once had meant gratification, they would have to reach for new extremes each time just to touch the edges of their own memories.\nThe Honored Matre’s grin widened, showing a line of gleaming white teeth. “Look at him, Muzzafar. He has not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ed1f579b77f3e86adc50021eed17fac57f09f6e8c18728c24f4c5f0e06b84ed6_v2"}
