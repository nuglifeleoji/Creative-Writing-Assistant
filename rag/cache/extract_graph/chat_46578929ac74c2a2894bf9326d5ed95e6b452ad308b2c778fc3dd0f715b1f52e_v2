The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It’s a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are children to train that the tribe’s strength may never be lost.”\n“Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?” he asked.\n“The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food. Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on.”\n“My sister, Alla—is she accepted yet by the people?”\nChani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight. Her eyes bored into him. “It’s a thing to be discussed another time, beloved.”\n“Let us discuss it now.”\n“You should conserve your energies for the test,” she said.\nHe saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal in her voice. “The unknown brings its own worries,” he said.\nPresently she nodded, said, “There is yet... misunderstanding because of Alia’s strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more than an infant talks...of things that only an adult should know.\nThey do not understand the...change in the womb that made Alia...different.”\n“There is trouble?” he asked. And he thought: /’ve seen visions of trouble over Alia.\nChani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise. “Some of the women banded to appeal to the Reverend Mother. They demanded she exorcise the demon in her daughter. They quoted the scripture: ‘Suffer not a witch to live among us.’”\n“And what did my mother say to them?”\n“She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: ‘If Alia incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing the trouble.’ And she tried to explain how the change had worked on Alia in the womb. But the women were angry because they had been embarrassed. They went away muttering.”\nThere will be trouble because of Alia, he thought.\nA crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face, bringing the scent of the pre- spice mass. “El-Sayal, the rain of sand that brings the morning,” he said.\nHe looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the landscape beyond pity, the sand that was form absorbed in itself. Dry lightning streaked a dark corner to the south—sign that a storm had built up its static charge there. The roll of thunder boomed long after.\n“The voice that beautifies the land,” Chani said.\nMore of his men were stirring out of their tents. Guards were coming in from the rims. Everything\naround him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that required no orders.\n“Give as few orders as possible,” his father had told him...once...long ago. “Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that Subject.”\nThe Fremen knew this rule instinctively.\nThe troop’s watermaster began the morning chanty, adding to it now the call for the rite to initiate a sandrider.\n“The world is a carcass,” the man chanted, his voice wailing across the dunes. “Who can turn away the Angel of Death? What Shai-hulud has decreed must be.”\nPaul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the death chant of his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they hurled themselves into battle.\nWill there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another soul? Paul asked himself. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add another stone and think on Muad’Dib who died in this place?\nHe knew this was among the alternatives today, a fact along lines of the future radiating from this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued him. The more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of the jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His entire future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm—the violent nexus beyond which all was fog and clouds.\n“Stilgar approaches,” Chani said. “I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, | must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the Chronicles.” She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then she had herself under control. “When this is past, | shall prepare thy breakfast with my own hands,” she said. She turned away.\nStilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, Stirring up little dust puddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed Stare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the lines of craggy cheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock for all their movement.\nThe man carried Paul’s banner on its staff—the green and black banner with a water tube in the staff —that already was a legend in the land. Half pridefully, Paul thought: / cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a legend. They will mark how I parted from Chani, how I greet Stilgar—every move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. | must not die. Then it will be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad.\nStilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his sides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought how his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice.\n“They denied us the Hajj,” Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.\nAs Chani had taught him, Paul responded: “Who can deny a Fremen the right to walk or ride where he wills?”\n“Lam a Naib,” Stilgar said, “never to be taken alive. | am a leg of the death tripod that will destroy our foes.”\nSilence settled over them.\nPaul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar, the way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer. And he thought of how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing, an entire people who had lived with rage and grief all of their days, never once considering what might take the place of either— except for a dream with which Liet-Kynes had infused them before his death.\n“Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?” Stilgar asked.\n“He is ever with us,” the Fremen chanted.\nStilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice. “Now, remember what | told you. Do it simply and directly—nothing fancy. Among our people, we ride the maker at the age of twelve. You are more than six years beyond that age and not born to this life. You don’t have to impress anyone with your courage. We know you are brave. All you must do is call the maker and ride him.”\n“I will remember,” Paul said.\n“See that you do. l'Il not have you shame my teaching.”\nStilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe. The thing was pointed at one\nend, had a spring-wound clapper at the other end. “l prepared this thumper myself. It’s a good one. Take it.”\nPaul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.\n“Shishakli has your hooks,” Stilgar said. “He'll hand them to you as you step out onto that dune over there.” He pointed to his right. “Call a big maker, Usul. Show us the way.”\nPaul marked the tone of Stilgar’s voice—half ritual and half that of a worried friend.\nIn that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took on the silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and dryness even for Arrakis.\n“It is the time of the scalding day,” Stilgar said, and now his voice was entirely ritual. “Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader of men.”\nPaul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply now that the dawn wind had died. He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated —a dirty tan slope with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving out in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their camp.\nOne robed figure remained in Paul’s path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the Fedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask.\nShishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The shafts were about a meter and\na half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end, roughened at the other end for a firm grip.\nPaul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.\n“They are my own hooks,” Shishakli said in a husky voice. “They never have failed.”\nPaul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and up the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like a flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy ridge with only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a good dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the viewpoint vantage.\nStooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming. Then he hesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death necessities that faced him.\nWhen he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the sand, a giant worm—a maker—would hear and come to the drumming. With the whiplike hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker’s high curving back. For as long as a forward edge of a worm’s ring segment was held open by a hook, open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior, the creature would not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact, roll its gigantic body to bring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible.\nlam a sandrider, Paul told himself.\nHe glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only to shift those hooks down the curve of a maker’s immense side to make the creature roll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it done. He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.\nOnce he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland—to rest and restore himself—into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.\nHe lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.\n“You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,” Stilgar had explained. “You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you.”\nWith abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper’s latch. The clapper began\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_46578929ac74c2a2894bf9326d5ed95e6b452ad308b2c778fc3dd0f715b1f52e_v2"}
