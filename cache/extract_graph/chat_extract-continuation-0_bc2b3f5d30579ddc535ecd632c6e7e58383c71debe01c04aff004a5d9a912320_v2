It is... reborn. Only the shape is familiar. A Face Dancer might do as well.”\n“Not as well,” Paul said. “And you’re not a Face Dancer.”\n“That is true, m’Lord.”\n“Whence comes your shape?”\n“The genetic imprint of the original cells.”\n“Somewhere,” Paul said, “there’s a plastic something which remembers the shape of Duncan Idaho. It’s said the ancients probed this region before the Butlerian Jihad. What’s the extent of this memory, Hayt? What did it learn from the original?”\nThe ghola shrugged.\n“What if he wasn’t Idaho?” Chani asked.\n“He was.”\n“Can you be certain?” she asked.\n“He is Duncan in every aspect. | cannot imagine a force strong enough to hold that shape thus without any relaxation or any deviation.”\n“M’Lord!” Hayt objected. “Because we cannot imagine a thing, that doesn’t exclude it from reality. There are things | must do as a ghola that | would not do as a man.”\nKeeping his attention on Chani, Paul said: “You see?” She nodded.\nPaul turned away, fighting deep sadness. He crossed to the balcony windows, drew the draperies. Lights came on in the sudden gloom. He pulled the sash of his robe tight, listened for sounds behind him.\nNothing.\nHe turned. Chani stood as though entranced, her gaze centered on the ghola.\nHayt, Paul saw, had retreated to some inner chamber of his being—had gone back to the ghola place.\nChani turned at the sound of Paul’s return. She still felt the thralldom of the instant Paul had precipitated. For a brief moment, the ghola had been an intense, vital human being. For that moment, he had been someone she did not fear— indeed, someone she liked and admired. Now, she understood Paul’s purpose in this probing. He had wanted her to see the man in the ghola flesh.\nShe stared at Paul. “That man, was that Duncan Idaho?”\n“That was Duncan Idaho. He is still there.”\n“Would he have allowed Irulan to go on living?” Chani asked.\nThe water didn’t sink too deep, Paul thought. And he said: “If | commanded it.”\n“| don’t understand,” she said. “Shouldn’t you be angry?”\n“Lam angry.”\n“You don’t sound... angry. You sound sorrowful.”\nHe closed his eyes. “Yes. That, too.”\n“You're my man,” she said. “I know this, but suddenly | don’t understand you.”\nAbruptly, Paul felt that he walked down a long cavern. His flesh moved—one foot and then another—but his thoughts went elsewhere. “I don’t understand myself,” he whispered. When he opened his eyes, he found that he had moved away from Chani.\nShe spoke from somewhere behind him. “Beloved, l'Il not ask again what you've seen. | only know I’m to give you the heir we want.”\nHe nodded, then: “I’ve known that from the beginning.” He turned, studied her. Chani seemed very far away.\nShe drew herself up, placed a hand on her abdomen. “I’m hungry. The medics tell me | must eat three or four times\nwhat | ate before. I’m frightened, beloved. It goes too fast.” Too fast, he agreed. This fetus knows the necessity for speed.\nThe audacious nature of Muad’Dib’s actions may be seen in the fact that He knew from the beginning whither He was bound, yet not once did He step aside from that path. He put it clearly when He said:“I tell you that | come now to my time of testing when it will be shown that | am the Ultimate Servant.” Thus He weaves all into One, that both friend and foe may worship Him. It is for this reason and this reason only that His Apostles prayed: “Lord, save us from the other paths which Muad’Dib covered with the Waters of His Life.” Those “other paths” may be imagined only with the deepest revulsion.\n—FROM THE YIAM-EL-DIN (BOOK OF JUDGMENT)\nhe messenger was a young woman—her face, name and family known to Chani—which was how she’d penetrated Imperial Security.\nChani had done no more than identify her for a Security Officer named Bannerjee, who then arranged the meeting with Muad’Dib. Bannerjee acted out of instinct and the assurance that the young woman’s father had been a member of the Emperor’s Death Commandos, the dreaded Fedaykin, in the days before the Jihad. Otherwise, he might have ignored her plea that her message was intended only for the ears of Muad’Dib.\nShe was, of course, screened and searched before the meeting in Paul’s private office. Even so, Bannerjee accompanied her, hand on knife, other hand on her arm.\nIt was almost midday when they brought her into the room—an odd space, mixture of desert-Fremen and Family- Aristocrat. Hiereg hangings lined three walls: delicate tapestries adorned with figures out of Fremen mythology. A view screen covered the fourth wall, a silver-gray surface behind an oval desk whose top held only one object, a Fremen sandclock built into an orrery. The orrery, a\nSuspensor mechanism from Ix, carried both moons of Arrakis in the classic Worm Trine aligned with the sun.\nPaul, standing beside the desk, glanced at Bannerjee. The Security Officer was one of those who’d come up through the Fremen Constabulary, winning his place on brains and proven loyalty despite the smuggler ancestry attested by his name. He was a Solid figure, almost fat. Wisps of black hair fell down over the dark, wet-appearing skin of his forehead like the crest of an exotic bird. His eyes were blue- blue and steady in a gaze which could look upon happiness or atrocity without change of expression. Both Chani and Stilgar trusted him. Paul knew that if he told Bannerjee to throttle the girl immediately, Bannerjee would do it.\n“Sire, here is the messenger girl,” Bannerjee said. “M’Lady Chani said she sent word to you.”\n“Yes.” Paul nodded curtly.\nOddly, the girl didn’t look at him. Her attention remained on the orrery. She was dark-skinned, of medium height, her figure concealed beneath a robe whose rich wine fabric and simple cut spoke of wealth. Her blue-black hair was held ina narrow band of material which matched the robe. The robe concealed her hands. Paul suspected that the hands were tightly clasped. It would be in character. Everything about her would be in character—including the robe: a last piece of finery saved for such a moment.\nPaul motioned Bannerjee aside. He hesitated before obeying. Now, the girl moved—one step forward. When she moved there was grace. Still, her eyes avoided him.\nPaul cleared his throat.\nNow the girl lifted her gaze, the whiteless eyes widening with just the right shade of awe. She had an odd little face with delicate chin, a sense of reserve in the way she held her small mouth. The eyes appeared abnormally large above slanted cheeks. There was a cheerless air about her, something which said she seldom smiled. The corners of her\neyes even held a faint yellow misting which could have been from dust irritation or the tracery of semuta.\nEverything was in character.\n“You asked to see me,” Paul said.\nThe moment of supreme test for this girl-shape had come. Scytale had put on the shape, the mannerisms, the sex, the voice—everything his abilities could grasp and assume. But this was a female known to Muad’Dib in the sietch days. She’d been a child, then, but she and Muad’Dib shared common experiences. Certain areas of memory must be avoided delicately. It was the most exacting part Scytale had ever attempted.\n“I am Otheym’s Lichna of Berk al Dib.”\nThe girl’s voice came out small, but firm, giving name, father and pedigree.\nPaul nodded. He saw how Chani had been fooled. The timbre of voice, everything reproduced with exactitude. Had it not been for his own Bene Gesserit training in voice and for the web of dao in which oracular vision enfolded him, this Face-Dancer disguise might have gulled even him.\nTraining exposed certain discrepancies: the girl was older than her known years; too much control tuned the vocal cords; set of neck and shoulders missed by a fraction the subtle hauteur of Fremen poise. But there were niceties, too: the rich robe had been patched to betray actual status... and the features were beautifully exact. They spoke a certain sympathy of this Face Dancer for the role being played.\n“Rest in my home, daughter of Otheym,” Paul said in formal Fremen greeting. “You are welcome as water after a dry crossing.”\nThe faintest of relaxations exposed the confidence this apparent acceptance had conveyed.\n“I bring a message,” she said.\n“A man’s messenger is as himself,” Paul said.\nScytale breathed softly. It went well, but now came the crucial task: the Atreides must be guided onto that special path. He must lose his Fremen concubine in circumstances where no other shared the blame. The failure must belong only to the omnipotent Muad’Dib. He had to be led into an ultimate realization of his failure and thence to acceptance of the Tleilaxu alternative.\n“I am the smoke which banishes sleep in the night,” Scytale said, employing a Fedaykin code phrase: / bear bad tidings.\nPaul fought to maintain calmness. He felt naked, his soul abandoned in a groping-time concealed from every vision. Powerful oracles hid this Face Dancer. Only the edges of these moments were known to Paul. He knew only what he could not do. He could not slay this Face Dancer. That would precipitate the future which must be avoided at all cost. Somehow, a way must be found to reach into the darkness and change the terrifying pattern.\n“Give me your message,” Paul said.\nBannerjee moved to place himself where he could watch the girl’s face. She seemed to notice him for the first time and her gaze went to the knife handle beneath the Security Officer’s hand.\n“The innocent do not believe in evil,” she said, looking squarely at Bannerjee.\nAhhh, well done, Paul thought. It was what the real Lichna would’ve said. He felt a momentary pang for the real daughter of Otheym—dead now, a corpse in the sand. There was no time for such emotions, though. He scowled.\nBannerjee kept his attention on the girl.\n“| was told to deliver my message in secret,” she said.\n“Why?” Bannerjee demanded, voice harsh, probing.\n“Because it is my father’s wish.”\n“This is my friend,” Paul said. “Am | not a Fremen? Then my friend may hear anything | hear.”\nScytale composed the girl-shape. Was this a true Fremen custom... or was it a test?\n“The Emperor may make his own rules,” Scytale said. “This is the message: My father wishes you to come to him, bringing Chani.”\n“Why must I bring Chani?”\n“She is your woman and a Sayyadina.
