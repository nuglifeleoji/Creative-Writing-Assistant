，他已经在这块土地上生活了半辈子。他的后半辈子也要在这块土地上度过。往日的生活有苦也有甜。重要的是，他现在才感到腰板硬了一些。过去，日日夜夜熬煎和谋算的是怎样才不至于饿死；如今却有可能拿出一大笔钱来为这个他度过辛酸岁月的村庄做点事了。当然，比起一些干大事的人来说这实在算不了什么；可这是他孙少安呀……总之，就他而言，整整一个历史时期已经结束，他将踏上新的生活历程。只有一点不能改变：他还应该象往常一样，精神抖擞地跳上新生活的马车，坐在驾辕的位置上，绷紧全身的肌肉和神经，吆喝着，呐喊着，继续走向前去！ \n　　月亮是这样的皎洁，夜是这样宁静；村庄沉浸在睡梦之中，东拉河却依然吟唱着那支永不疲倦的歌……几天以后，孙少安要出钱重建学校的事件就传得家喻户晓了。不用说，这非凡之举博得一片赞扬之声。许乡村民出罢修庙宇的钱，又找到少安和俊武，也要为建校多少出一点钱。就是呀，神鬼要敬，可孩子却是天使！ \n　　于是，双水村出现了“今古奇观”：党支部一筹莫展立在圈外，而两个民间组织——以孙少安、金俊武为首的“建校会”和以刘玉升、金光亮为首的“建庙会”，用竞争和对抗的形式领导起本村公众生活的潮流，更叫人哭笑不得的是，许多人竟对这两个“会”同时都抱支持的态度。 \n                  第51章\n　　生活的大轮在铿锵地前行，时间却在无声地流逝——一九八四年就要结束了。 \n　　在这个将要成为历史的年份里，中国和世界都有过一些重要的事件。世人瞩目的第二十三届现代奥林匹克运动会七八月间在美国洛杉矶举行。如果古希腊的圣贤们转世再生，一定会对现代人类道德水准如此之低而摇头叹息：在神圣的奥运会期间，全球各地的战争和杀戳依然如火如荼地进行……对中国来说，本年度最重大的历史事件，是中英两国政府签订了香港问题的联合声明。英国人保持了体面，中国人获得了尊严。 \n　　结束了，一九八四年！人们怀着各式各样的心情将要和这个年头永远地告别了……一九八四年的最后一天，铜城地区落了一层鸡爪子荒雪。 \n　　中午前后出了太阳，那层薄雪顷刻间就融化了。因为刚开始数九，天气还未大冻；地上甚至有种潮润润的气息。 \n　　在大牙湾煤矿各个黑户区的窝棚土窑里，到处都在炒、炸、蒸、煮……空气中弥漫着混杂的香味。矿区虽没有显出象大城市那样的过年气氛，但也不象农村那样轻视这个“�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安
