无论是在哪个时代，魂师面对魂兽，其实最重要的一点都是要对魂兽足够了解，然后才能制定相应的策略去面对魂兽，战胜魂兽。\n\n    蓝轩宇现在脑海中出现的就是有关于幽冥狼的资料。\n\n    除了它们的特性之外，爸爸好像说过，幽冥狼生性多疑，一般不喜欢正面进攻，而是寻找到破绽之后一击制敌。就像先前偷袭自己。也就是说，它们其实也会有害怕么？\n\n    想到这里，蓝轩宇心中一动，左手抬起，一根根银纹蓝银草顿时反卷而下，覆盖住了他的手掌。一枚水球也随之出现在他掌心之上，被他托举在头顶上方。\n\n    果然，当这水球出现的时候，三头正在缓缓靠近的幽冥狼都停下了脚步。幽绿色的眼睛紧紧的盯视着蓝轩宇，然后缓缓向侧方徘徊，围绕着他。\n\n    狼是一种特别有耐心的魂兽，它们也特别擅长寻找机会。甚至可以和目标不断的消耗，消耗到对方疲倦露出破绽为止。\n\n    爸爸当初是这么说的，但至少，在看到水球让幽冥狼暂时停下之后，蓝轩宇略微松了口气。\n\n    他略作思考之后，手中的水球开始出现变化，缓缓的凝结成一枚冰球，散发着淡淡的寒意。\n\n    幽冥狼的步伐顿时变得更慢了几分，警惕的看着他。\n\n    蓝轩宇把冰球交到自己的右手之中，然后左手又凝聚出一枚同样大小的冰球。\n\n    河边水元素充沛，他在操控的时候还是相当容易的。\n\n    然后他缓缓向前走了一步。\n\n    三头幽冥狼几乎是同步跟着他走出一步，依旧保持着先前和他同样的距离。\n\n    蓝轩宇看看周围，突然，他加快了脚步，猛的朝着一个方向跑出三步。\n\n    三头幽冥狼像是吓了一跳，先是后跃，拉开了一点距离，然后才跟了上来。\n\n    而就在这时，蓝轩宇突然发足狂奔起来，认准一个方向就跑。\n\n    逃跑？逃跑的时候可是最容易露出破绽的啊！三头幽冥狼锲而不舍的迅速追了上来。\n\n    正向蓝轩宇判断的那样，论奔跑，他怎么可能比得上以速度见长的幽冥狼呢？\n\n    很快三头幽冥狼就追了上来。\n\n    但就在这个时候，蓝轩宇的脚下却突然出现了变化，他先是向左右各自大幅度的虚晃一下，然后身体旋转，借助前冲的惯性，滴溜溜一个转身，就改变了方向。\n\n    在高速行进过程中突然变向，这可不是一件容易做到的事情啊！而且他这个变化的速度极快，给人一种�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
