He glared at Alia, an angry gnome, bald and fuming.\n“Do you know what’s being said about your brother?” he demanded.\n“I know what’s being said about your Qizarate,” Alia countered. “You’re not divines, you’re god’s spies.”\nKorba glanced at Paul for support, said: “We are sent by the writ of Muad’Dib, that He shall know the truth of His people and they shall know the truth of Him.”\n“Spies,” Alia said.\nKorba pursed his lips in injured silence.\nPaul looked at his sister, wondering why she provoked Korba. Abruptly, he saw that Alia had passed into womanhood, beautiful with the first blazing innocence of youth. He found himself surprised that he hadn’t noticed it until this moment. She was fifteen—almost sixteen, a Reverend Mother without motherhood, virgin priestess, object of fearful veneration for the superstitious masses— Alia of the Knife.\n“This is not the time or place for your sister’s levity,” lrulan said.\nPaul ignored her, nodded to Korba. “The square’s full of pilgrims. Go out and lead their prayer.”\n“But they expect you, m’Lord,” Korba said.\n“Put on your turban,” Paul said. “They’ll never know at this distance.”\nlrulan smothered irritation at being ignored, watched Korba arise to obey. She’d had the sudden disquieting thought that Edric might not hide her actions from Alia. What do we really know of the sister? she wondered.\nChani, hands tightly clasped in her lap, glanced across the table at Stilgar, her uncle, Paul’s Minister of State. Did the old Fremen Naib ever long for the simpler life of his desert sietch? she wondered. Stilgar’s black hair, she noted, had begun to gray at the edges, but his eyes beneath heavy brows remained far-seeing. It was the eagle stare of the wild, and his beard still carried the catchtube indentation of life in a stillsuit.\nMade nervous by Chani’s attention, Stilgar looked around the Council Chamber. His gaze fell on the balcony window and Korba standing outside. Korba raised outstretched arms for the benediction and a trick of the afternoon sun cast a red halo onto the window behind him. For a moment, Stilgar saw the Court Qizara as a figure crucified on a fiery wheel. Korba lowered his arms, destroyed the illusion, but Stilgar remained shaken by it. His thoughts went in angry\nfrustration to the fawning supplicants waiting in the Audience Hall, and to the hateful pomp which surrounded Muad’Dib’s throne.\nConvening with the Emperor, one hoped for a fault in him, to find mistakes, Stilgar thought. He felt this might be sacrilege, but wanted it anyway.\nDistant crowd murmuring entered the chamber as Korba returned. The balcony door thumped into its seals behind him, shutting off the sound.\nPaul’s gaze followed the Qizara. Korba took his seat at Paul’s left, dark features composed, eyes glazed by fanaticism. He’d enjoyed that moment of religious power.\n“The spirit presence has been invoked,” he said.\n“Thank the lord for that,” Alia said.\nKorba’s lips went white.\nAgain, Paul studied his sister, wondered at her motives. Her innocence masked deception, he told himself. She’d come out of the same Bene Gesserit breeding program as he had. What had the kwisatz haderach genetics produced in her? There was always that mysterious difference: she’d been an embryo in the womb when her mother had survived the raw melange poison. Mother and unborn daughter had become Reverend Mothers simultaneously. But simultaneity didn’t carry identity.\nOf the experience, Alia said that in one terrifying instant she had awakened to consciousness, her memory absorbing the uncounted other-lives which her mother was assimilating.\n“I became my mother and all the others,” she said. “I was unformed, unborn, but | became an old woman then and there.”\nSensing his thoughts on her, Alia smiled at Paul. His expression softened. How could anyone react to Korba with other than cynical humor? he asked himself. What is more ridiculous than a Death Commando transformed into a priest?\nStilgar tapped his papers. “If my liege permits,” he said. “These are matters urgent and dire.”\n“The Tupile Treaty?” Paul asked.\n“The Guild maintains that we must sign this treaty without knowing the precise location of the Tupile Entente,” Stilgar said. “They’ve some support from Landsraad delegates.”\n“What pressures have you brought to bear?” Irulan asked.\n“Those pressures which my Emperor has designated for this enterprise,” Stilgar said. The stiff formality of his reply contained all his disapproval of the Princess Consort.\n“My Lord and husband,” Irulan said, turning to Paul, forcing him to acknowledge her.\nEmphasizing the titular difference in front of Chani, Paul thought, is a weakness. In such moments, he shared Stilgar’s dislike for Irulan, but sympathy tempered his emotions. What was Irulan but a Bene Gesserit pawn?\n“Yes?” Paul said.\nlrulan stared at him. “If you withheld their melange...”\nChani shook her head in dissent.\n“We tread with caution,” Paul said. “Tupile remains the place of sanctuary for defeated Great Houses. It symbolizes a last resort, a final place of safety for all our subjects. Exposing the sanctuary makes it vulnerable.”\n“If they can hide people they can hide other things,” Stilgar rumbled. “An army, perhaps, or the beginnings of melange culture which—”\n“You don’t back people into a corner,” Alia said. “Not if you want them to remain peaceful.” Ruefully, she saw that she’d been drawn into the contention which she’d foreseen.\n“So we've spent ten years of negotiation for nothing,” lrulan said.\n“None of my brother’s actions is for nothing,” Alia said.\nlrulan picked up a scribe, gripped it with white-knuckled intensity. Paul saw her marshal emotional control in the Bene Gesserit way: the penetrating inward stare, deep\nbreathing. He could almost hear her repeating the litany. Presently, she said: “What have we gained?”\n“We've kept the Guild off balance,” Chani said.\n“We want to avoid a showdown confrontation with our enemies,” Alia said. “We have no special desire to kill them. There’s enough butchery going on under the Atreides banner.”\nShe feels it, too, Paul thought. Strange, what a sense of compelling responsibility they both felt for that brawling, idolatrous universe with its ecstasies of tranquility and wild motion. Must we protect them from themselves? he wondered. They play with nothingness every moment— empty lives, empty words. They ask too much of me. His throat felt tight and full. How many moments would he lose? What sons? What dreams? Was it worth the price his vision had revealed? Who would ask the living of some far distant future, who would say to them: “But for Muad’Dib, you would not be here.”\n“Denying them their melange would solve nothing,” Chani said. “So the Guild’s navigators would lose their ability to see into timespace. Your Sisters of the Bene Gesserit would lose their truthsense. Some people might die before their time. Communication would break down. Who could be blamed?”\n“They wouldn’t let it come to that,” Irulan said.\n“Wouldn't they?” Chani asked. “Why not? Who could blame the Guild? They’d be helpless, demonstrably so.”\n“We'll sign the treaty as it stands,” Paul said.\n“M’Lord,” Stilgar said, concentrating on his hands, “there is a question in our minds.”\n“Yes?” Paul gave the old Fremen his full attention.\n“You have certain... powers,” Stilgar said. “Can you not locate the Entente despite the Guild?”\nPowers! Paul thought. Stilgar couldn’t just say: “You’re prescient. Can’t you trace a path in the future that leads to Tupile?”\nPaul looked at the golden surface of the table. Always the same problem: How could he express the limits of the inexpressible? Should he speak of fragmentation, the natural destiny of all power? How could someone who’d never experienced the spice change of prescience conceive an awareness containing no localized spacetime, no personal image-vector nor associated sensory captives?\nHe looked at Alia, found her attention on Irulan. Alia sensed his movement, glanced at him, nodded toward lrulan. Ahhh, yes: any answer they gave would find its way into one of Irulan’s special reports to the Bene Gesserit. They never gave up seeking an answer to their kwisatz haderach.\nStilgar, though, deserved an answer of some kind. For that matter, so did Irulan.\n“The uninitiated try to conceive of prescience as obeying a Natural Law,” Paul said. He steepled his hands in front of him. “But it’d be just as correct to say it’s heaven speaking to us, that being able to read the future is a harmonious act of man’s being. In other words, prediction is a natural consequence in the wave of the present. It wears the guise of nature, you see. But such powers cannot be used from an attitude that prestates aims and purposes. Does a chip caught in the wave say where it’s going? There’s no cause and effect in the oracle. Causes become occasions of convections and confluences, places where the currents meet. Accepting prescience, you fill your being with concepts repugnant to the intellect. Your intellectual consciousness, therefore, rejects them. In rejecting, intellect becomes a part of the processes, and is subjugated.”\n“You cannot do it?” Stilgar asked.\n“Were | to seek Tupile with prescience,” Paul said, speaking directly to Irulan, “this might hide Al\n“Chaos!” Irulan protested. “It hasno...no.. consistency.”\n“I did say it obeys no Natural Law,” Paul said.\n“Then there are limits to what you can see or do with your powers?” Irulan asked.\nBefore Paul could answer, Alia said: “Dear Irulan, prescience has no limits. Not consistent? Consistency isn’t a necessary aspect of the universe.”\n“But he said...”\n“How can my brother give you explicit information about the limits of something which has no limits? The boundaries escape the intellect.”\nThat was a nasty thing for Alia to do, Paul thought. It would alarm Irulan, who had such a careful consciousness, so dependent upon values derived from precise limits. His gaze went to Korba, who sat in a pose of religious reverie— listening with the soul. How could the Qizarate use this exchange? More religious mystery? Something to evoke awe? No doubt.\n“Then you'll sign the treaty in its present form?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul smiled. The issue of the oracle, by Stilgar’s judgment, had been closed. Stilgar aimed only at victory, not at discovering truth. Peace, justice and a sound coinage —these anchored Stilgar’s universe. He wanted something visible and real—a signature on a treaty.\n“PIL sign it,” Paul said.\nStilgar took up a fresh folder. “The latest communication from our field commanders in Sector Ixian speaks of agitation for a constitution.” The old Fremen glanced at Chani, who shrugged.\nlrulan, who had closed her eyes", " Irulan, who had such a careful consciousness, so dependent upon values derived from precise limits.

We must tell the truth about the Atreides, how he maneuvers behind the triple sham of Landsraad legislation, religious sanction and bureaucratic efficiency.” He pushed the note back into the folder.\n“A constitution,” Chani murmured.\nPaul glanced at her, back to Stilgar. Thus the Jihad falters, Paul thought, but not soon enough to save me. The thought produced emotional tensions. He remembered his earliest visions of the Jinad-to-be, the terror and revulsion he’d experienced. Now, of course, he knew visions of greater terrors. He had lived with the real violence. He had seen his Fremen, charged with mystical strength, sweep all before them in the religious war. The Jihad gained a new perspective. It was finite, of course, a brief spasm when measured against eternity, but beyond lay horrors to overshadow anything in the past.\nAll in my name, Paul thought.\n“Perhaps they could be given the form of a constitution,” Chani suggested. “It needn’t be actual.”\n“Deceit js a tool of statecraft,” Irulan agreed.\n“There are limits to power, as those who put their hopes in a constitution always discover,” Paul said.\nKorba straightened from his reverent pose. “M’Lord?”\n“Yes?” And Paul thought, Here now! Here’s one who may harbor secret sympathies for an imagined rule of Law.\n“We could begin with a religious constitution,” Korba said, “something for the faithful who—”\n“No!” Paul snapped. “We will make this an Order in Council. Are you recording this, Irulan?”\n“Yes, m’Lord,” Irulan said, voice frigid with dislike for the menial role he forced upon her.\n“Constitutions become the ultimate tyranny,” Paul said. “They’re organized power on such a scale as to be overwhelming. The constitution is social power mobilized and it has no conscience. It can crush the highest and the lowest, removing all dignity and individuality. It has an unstable balance point and no limitations. |, however, have limitations. In my desire to provide an ultimate protection for my people, | forbid a constitution. Order in Council, this date, etcetera, etcetera.”\n“What of the Ixian concern about the tax, m’Lord?” Stilgar asked.\nPaul forced his attention away from the brooding, angry look on Korba’s face, said: “You’ve a proposal, Stil?”\n“We must have control of taxes, Sire.”\n“Our price to the Guild for my signature on the Tupile Treaty,” Paul said, “is the submission of the Ixian Confederacy to our tax. The Confederacy cannot trade without Guild transport. They’ll pay.”\n“Very good, m’Lord.” Stilgar produced another folder, cleared his throat. “The Qizarate’s report on Salusa Secundus. Irulan’s father has been putting his legions through landing maneuvers.”\nlrulan found something of interest in the palm of her left hand. A pulse throbbed at her neck.\n“Irulan,” Paul asked, “do you persist in arguing that your father’s one legion is nothing more than a toy?”\n“What could he do with only one legion?” she asked. She stared at him out of slitted eyes.\n“He could get himself killed,” Chani said.\nPaul nodded. “And I'd be blamed.”\n“I know a few commanders in the Jihad,” Alia said, “who'd pounce if they learned of this.”\n“But it’s only his police force!” Irulan protested.\n“Then they have no need for landing maneuvers,” Paul said. “I suggest that your next little note to your father\ncontain a frank and direct discussion of my views about his delicate position.”\nShe lowered her gaze. “Yes, m’Lord. | hope that will be the end of it. My father would make a good martyr.”\n“Mmmmmmm,” Paul said. “My sister wouldn’t send a message to those commanders she mentioned unless | ordered it.”\n“An attack on my father carries dangers other than the obvious military ones,” Irulan said. “People are beginning to look back on his reign with a certain nostalgia.”\n“You'll go too far one day,” Chani said in her deadly serious Fremen voice.\n“Enough!” Paul ordered.\nHe weighed Irulan’s revelation about public nostalgia—ah, now! that’d carried a note of truth. Once more, Irulan had proved her worth.\n“The Bene Gesserit send a formal supplication,” Stilgar said, presenting another folder. “They wish to consult you about the preservation of your bloodline.”\nChani glanced sideways at the folder as though it contained a deadly device.\n“Send the Sisterhood the usual excuses,” Paul said.\n“Must we?” Irulan demanded.\n“Perhaps... this is the time to discuss it,” Chani said.\nPaul shook his head sharply. They couldn’t know that this was part of the price he had not yet decided to pay.\nBut Chani wasn’t to be stopped. “I have been to the prayer wall of Sietch Tabr where | was born,” she said. “I have submitted to doctors. | have knelt in the desert and sent my thoughts into the depths where dwells Shai-hulud. Yet”—she shrugged—“nothing avails.”\nScience and superstition, all have failed her, Paul thought. Do I fail her, too, by not telling her what bearing an heir to House Atreides will precipitate? He looked up to find an expression of pity in Alia’s eyes. The idea of pity from his sister repelled him. Had she, too, seen that terrifying future?\n“My Lord must know the dangers to his realm when he has no heir,” Irulan said, using her Bene Gesserit powers of voice with an oily persuasiveness. “These things are naturally difficult to discuss, but they must be brought into the open. An Emperor is more than a man. His figure leads the realm. Should he die without an heir, civil strife must follow. As you love your people, you cannot leave them thus?”\nPaul pushed himself away from the table, strode to the balcony windows. A wind was flattening the smoke of the city’s fires out there. The sky presented a darkening silver- blue softened by the evening fall of dust from the Shield Wall. He stared southward at the escarpment which protected his northern lands from the coriolis wind, and he wondered why his own peace of mind could find no such shield.\nThe Council sat silently waiting behind him, aware of how close to rage he was.\nPaul sensed time rushing upon him. He tried to force himself into a tranquility of many balances where he might Shape a new future.\nDisengage... disengage... disengage, he thought. What would happen if he took Chani, just picked up and left with her, sought sanctuary on Tupile? His name would remain behind. The Jihad would find new and more terrible centers upon which to turn. He’d be blamed for that, too. He felt suddenly fearful that in reaching for any new thing he might let fall what was most precious, that even the slightest noise from him might send the universe crashing back, receding until he never could recapture any piece of it.\nBelow him, the square had become the setting for a band of pilgrims in the green and white of the hajj. They wended their way like a disjointed snake behind a striding Arrakeen guide. They reminded Paul that his reception hall would be packed with supplicants by now. Pilgrims! Their exercise in\nhomelessness had become a disgusting source of wealth for his Imperium. The hajj filled the spoace-ways with religious tramps. They came and they came and they came.\nHow did I set this in motion? he asked himself.\nIt had, of course, set itself in motion. It was in the genes which might labor for centuries to achieve this brief spasm.\nDriven by that deepest religious instinct, the people came, seeking their resurrection. The pilgrimage ended here —“Arrakis, the place of rebirth, the place to die.”\nSnide old Fremen said he wanted the pilgrims for their water.\nWhat was it the pilgrims really sought? Paul wondered. They said they came to a holy place. But they must know the universe contained no Eden-source, no Tupile for the soul. They called Arrakis the place of the unknown where all mysteries were explained. This was a link between their universe and the next. And the frightening thing was that they appeared to go away Satisfied.\nWhat do they find here? Paul asked himself.\nOften in their religious ecstasy, they filled the streets with screeching like some odd aviary. In fact, the Fremen called them “passage birds.” And the few who died here were “winged souls.”\nWith a sigh, Paul thought how each new planet his legions subjugated opened new sources of pilgrims. They came out of gratitude for “the peace of Muad’Dib.”\nEverywhere there is peace, Paul thought. Everywhere... except in the heart of Muad’Dib.\nHe felt that some element of himself lay immersed in frosty hoar-darkness without end. His prescient power had tampered with the image of the universe held by all mankind. He had shaken the safe cosmos and replaced security with his Jihad. He had out-fought and out-thought and out-predicted the universe of men, but a certainty filled him that this universe still eluded him.\nThis planet beneath him which he had commanded be remade from desert into a water-rich paradise, it was alive. It had a pulse as dynamic as that of any human. It fought him, resisted, slipped away from his commands...\nA hand crept into Paul’s. He looked down to see Chani peering up at him, concern in her eyes. Those eyes drank him, and she whispered: “Please, love, do not battle with your ruh-self.” An outpouring of emotion swept upward from her hand, buoyed him.\n“Sihaya,” he whispered.\n“We must go to the desert soon,” she said in a low voice.\nHe squeezed her hand, released it, returned to the table where he remained standing.\nChani took her seat.\nlrulan stared at the papers in front of Stilgar, her mouth a tight line.\n“I", " out-predicted the universe of men, but a certainty filled him that this universe still eluded him.\nThis planet beneath him which he had commanded be remade from desert into a water-rich paradise, it was alive.

He glanced at Chani, back to Irulan, who refused to meet his gaze. “We all know she holds no love for me.”\nlrulan went very still.\n“I know the political arguments,” Paul said. “It’s the human arguments which concern me. | think if the Princess Consort were not bound by the commands of the Bene Gesserit, if she did not seek this out of desires for personal power, my reaction might be very different. As matters stand, though, | reject this proposal.”\nlrulan took a deep, shaky breath.\nPaul, resuming his seat, thought he had never seen her under such poor control. Leaning toward her, he said: “Irulan, | am truly sorry.”\nShe lifted her chin, a look of pure fury in her eyes. “I don’t want your pity!” she hissed. And turning to Stilgar: “Is there more that’s urgent and dire?”\nHolding his gaze firmly on Paul, Stilgar said: “One more matter, m’Lord. The Guild again proposes a formal embassy here on Arrakis.”\n“One of the deep-space kind?” Korba asked, his voice full of fanatic loathing.\n“Presumably,” Stilgar said.\n“A matter to be considered with the utmost care, m’Lord,” Korba warned. “The Council of Naibs would not like it, an actual Guildsman here on Arrakis. They contaminate the very ground they touch.”\n“They live in tanks and don’t touch the ground,” Paul said, letting his voice reveal irritation.\n“The Naibs might take matters into their own hands, m’Lord,” Korba said.\nPaul glared at him.\n“They are Fremen, after all, m’Lord,” Korba insisted. “We well remember how the Guild brought those who oppressed us. We have not forgotten the way they blackmailed a spice ransom from us to keep our secrets from our enemies. They drained us of every—”\n“Enough!” Paul snapped. “Do you think / have forgotten?”\nAs though he had just awakened to the import of his own words, Korba stuttered unintelligibly, then: “M’lord, forgive me. | did not mean to imply you are not Fremen. | did not...”\n“They'll send a Steersman,” Paul said. “It isn’t likely a Steersman would come here if he could see danger in it.”\nHer mouth dry with sudden fear, Irulan said: “You’ve... seena Steersman come here?”\n“Of course | haven’t seen a Steersman,” Paul said, mimicking her tone. “But | can see where one’s been and where one’s going. Let them send us a Steersman. Perhaps | have a use for such a one.”\n“So ordered,” Stilgar said.\nAnd Irulan, hiding a smile behind her hand, thought: /t’s true then. Our Emperor cannot see a Steersman. They are mutually blind. The conspiracy is hidden.\nOnce more the drama begins.\n—THE EMPEROR PAUL MUAD’DIB ON HIS ASCENSION TO THE LION THRONE\nlia peered down from her spy window into the great reception hall to watch the advance of the Guild entourage.\nThe sharply silver light of noon poured through clerestory windows onto a floor worked in green, blue and eggshell tiles to simulate a bayou with water plants and, here and there, a splash of exotic color to indicate bird or animal.\nGuildsmen moved across the tile pattern like hunters stalking their prey in a strange jungle. They formed a moving design of gray robes, black robes, orange robes—all arrayed in a deceptively random way around the transparent tank where the Steersman-Ambassador swam in his orange gas. The tank slid on its supporting field, towed by two gray-robed attendants, like a rectangular ship being warped into its dock.\nDirectly beneath her, Paul sat on the Lion Throne on its raised dais. He wore the new formal crown with its fish and fist emblems. The jeweled golden robes of state covered his body. The shimmering of a personal shield surrounded him. Two wings of bodyguards fanned out on both sides along the dais and down the steps. Stilgar stood two steps below Paul’s right hand in a white robe with a yellow rope fora belt.\nSibling empathy told her that Paul seethed with the same agitation she was experiencing, although she doubted another could detect it. His attention remained on an orange-robed attendant whose blindly staring metal eyes looked neither to right nor to left. This attendant walked at\nthe right front corner of the Ambassador’s troupe like a military outrider. A rather flat face beneath curly black hair, such of his figure as could be seen beneath the orange robe, every gesture shouted a familiar identity.\nIt was Duncan Idaho.\nIt could not be Duncan Idaho, yet it was.\nCaptive memories absorbed in the womb during the moment of her mother’s spice change identified this man for Alia by a rihani decipherment which cut through all camouflage. Paul was seeing him, she knew, out of countless personal experiences, out of gratitudes and youthful sharing.\nIt was Duncan.\nAlia shuddered. There could be only one answer: this was a Tleilaxu ghola, a being reconstructed from the dead flesh of the original. That original had perished saving Paul. This could only be a product of the axolotl tanks.\nThe ghola walked with the cock-footed alertness of a master swordsman. He came to a halt as the Ambassador’s tank glided to a stop ten paces from the steps of the dais.\nIn the Bene Gesserit way she could not escape, Alia read Paul’s disquiet. He no longer looked at the figure out of his past. Not looking, his whole being stared. Muscles strained against restrictions as he nodded to the Guild Ambassador, said: “I am told your name is Edric. We welcome you to our Court in the hope this will bring new understanding between us.”\nThe Steersman assumed a sybaritic reclining pose in his orange gas, popped a melange capsule into his mouth before meeting Paul’s gaze. The tiny transducer orbiting a corner of the Guildsman’s tank reproduced a coughing sound, then the rasping, uninvolved voice: “I abase myself before my Emperor and beg leave to present my credentials and offer a small gift.”\nAn aide passed a scroll up to Stilgar, who studied it, scowling, then nodded to Paul. Both Stilgar and Paul turned\nthen toward the ghola standing patiently below the dais.\n“Indeed my Emperor has discerned the gift,” Edric said.\n“We are pleased to accept your credentials,” Paul said. “Explain the gift.”\nEdric rolled in the tank, bringing his attention to bear on the ghola. “This is a man called Hayt,” he said, spelling the name. “According to our investigators, he has a most curious history. He was killed here on Arrakis . . . a grievous head-wound which required many months of regrowth. The body was sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School. It came to our attention that this must be Duncan Idaho, the trusted retainer of your household. We bought him as a gift befitting an Emperor.” Edric peered up at Paul. “Is it not Idaho, Sire?”\nRestraint and caution gripped Paul’s voice. “He has the aspect of Idaho.”\nDoes Paul see something | don’t? Alia wondered. No! It’s Duncan!\nThe man called Hayt stood impassively, metal eyes fixed straight ahead, body relaxed. No sign escaped him to indicate he knew himself to be the object of discussion.\n“According to our best knowledge, it’s Idaho,” Edric said.\n“He’s called Hayt now,” Paul said. “A curious name.”\n“Sire, there’s no divining how or why the Tleilaxu bestow names,” Edric said. “But names can be changed. The Tleilaxu name is of little importance.”\nThis ts a Tleilaxu thing, Paul thought. There’s the problem. The Bene Tleilax held little attachment to phenomenal nature. Good and evil carried strange meanings in their philosophy. What might they have incorporated in Idaho’s flesh—out of design or whim?\nPaul glanced at Stilgar, noted the Fremen’s superstitious awe. It was an emotion echoed all through his Fremen guard. Stilgar’s mind would be speculating about the loathsome habits of Guildsmen, of Tleilaxu and of gholas.\nTurning toward the ghola, Paul said: “Hayt, is that your only name?”\nA serene smile spread over the ghola’s dark features. The metal eyes lifted, centered on Paul, but maintained their mechanical stare. “That is how | am called, my Lord: Hayt.”\nIn her dark spy hole, Alia trembled. It was Idaho’s voice, a quality of sound so precise she sensed its imprint upon her cells.\n“May it please my Lord,” the ghola added, “if | say his voice gives me pleasure. This is a sign, say the Bene Tleilax, that | have heard the voice... . before.”\n“But you don’t know this for sure,” Paul said.\n“I know nothing of my past for sure, my Lord. It was explained that | can have no memory of my former life. All that remains from before is the pattern set by the genes. There are, however, niches into which once-familiar things may fit. There are voices, places, foods, faces, sounds, actions—a sword in my hand, the controls of a ’thopter.. .”\nNoting how intently the Guildsmen watched this exchange, Paul asked: “Do you understand that you’re a gift?”\n“It was explained to me, my Lord.”\nPaul sat back, hands resting on the arms of the throne.\nWhat debt do I owe Duncan’s flesh? he wondered. The man died saving my life. But this is not Idaho, this is a ghola. Yet, here were body and mind which had taught Paul to fly a ‘thopter as though the wings grew from his own shoulders. Paul knew he could not pick up a sword without leaning on the harsh education Idaho had given him. A ghola. This was flesh full of false impressions, easily misread. Old associations would persist. Duncan Idaho. It wasn’t so much a mask the ghola wore as it was a loose, concealing garment of personality which moved in a way different from whatever the Tleilaxu had hidden here.\n“How might you serve us?” Paul asked.\n“In any way my Lord’s wishes and my capabilities agree.”\nAlia, watching"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_8ab0534930e1a464e960d3d57b25762a023cb38f7ff15f6c50b6ab5ce07cd0ee_v2"}
