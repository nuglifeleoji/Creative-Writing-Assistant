\n　　等老师傅把烧红的铁块放在铁砧子上后，少安就抡起锤和老汉一人一下打起来。他因为常出去为队里修理损坏的农具，曾在石圪节也是一家河南人的铁铺里抡过这家伙，因此不外行。再说，这是力气活，又没什么太高的技术要求。 \n　　等他抡完一轮锤后，这铁匠师徒俩都夸他在行。少安笑了笑说：“出一阵力身上就暖和了。” \n　　少安又抡了两回锤，看这把镢头快成形了，就把铁锤又交给那个年轻徒弟。 \n　　老镢头全部打成后，这师徒两个把墙角一个放工具的土台子收拾开，给土台子上铺了一块破帆布，对少安说：“就凑合着躺一夜吧。”说完他们就到里面的一个小窑里睡觉去了。 \n　　少安在地上搬了一个废铁砧子，把自己的罩衣脱了垫在这砧子上，就算是个枕头。他拉灭了灯，在一片黑暗中疲乏地躺下来，很快就睡着了……第二天早晨，孙少安在饭铺里吃喝了一点，就到兽医站把他的牛吆上，起身回双水村了。 \n　　一路上，他由着牛的性子走，并不催促它，因此慢慢腾腾，三十里路走了将近一个上午。 \n　　在接近城里人吃午饭的时候，少安吆着牛才走到双水村北边的村头上。 \n　　他看见前面的公路上，田二正在路边的水沟里弯腰寻找什么破烂。等他走到田二身边时，老汉怔了一会，大概才认出这是一个“熟人”。 \n　　少安对他说：“二叔，快回去吃饭！” \n　　田二神秘对他微笑着，嘴里嘟囔说：“世事要变了……”说完就又低头在水沟的碎柴烂草中翻搅起来。 \n　　少安吆着牛从他身边走过，心里随意感叹地想：如果我活成他这个样子，早就上吊死了！随即他又笑了，想：问题是活成他这个样子，往往连死都不懂了……田二父子俩是他队里的社员。他同情这两个不省人事的人。每当路上看见顽皮的村童欺负他们时，他总要把孩子们撵跑。田二的憨小子他干脆打发到大队的基建队上——那里劳动的人比较集中，好照看他。 \n　　现在，少安吆着牛已经进了村。 \n　　他正准备把牛吆到田家圪崂的饲养室里，看见二队长金俊武担一担粪，从东拉河的列石上走过来，并对他招呼说：“少安，你等一下……” \n　　二队长金俊武四十来岁，腰圆膀粗，长一对炯炯有光的铜铸大眼。这人悍性很强：脑子里弯弯又多，是金家族里的一条好汉。他父亲就是旧社会双水村著名的文人金先生——老先生五二年就去\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
