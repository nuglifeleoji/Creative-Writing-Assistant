\n　　孙少安万分痛苦！万分焦急！他是一个有些文化的人，常常较一般农民更能深远地考虑问题。正因为如此，他的苦恼也当然要比一般农民更为深刻……庄稼大头收过之后，少安有时也去石圪节赶集。他既去散散心，也在那条尘土飞扬的土街上出售一点自产的土豆和南瓜，换两个零用钱以头回日常用的油盐酱醋。债务是债务，每一天的日子还得要过呀。 \n　　这一天下午，他提着煤油瓶从石圪节蔫头耷脑往回走。在未到罐子村时，从米家镇方向开过来的一辆大卡车，突然停在了他身边。驾驶楼里即刻跳出来一个人，笑嘻嘻地向他伸出了手。 \n　　少安马上认出，这是他在一九八一年原西县那次“夸富”会上认识的胡永合。 \n　　他赶紧把油瓶从右手倒在左手，握住了永合的手。永合早已是闻名全县的“农民企业家”。少安和他虽交往不多，但两个人已经算是朋友了。在他开始销售砖的时候，正是永合对他进行了做生意的“启蒙教育”。他不仅感激他，也很佩服柳岔乡这个大能人。 \n　　“我路过你们村，发观你的砖场不冒烟了。怎？你又搞什么大生意去了？”胡永合笑着问他。 \n　　“唉……”孙少安有点羞愧地长叹了一口气，“还搞什么大生意呢！就那个小砖场，也倒塌了！” \n　　“怎？”胡永合一脸的惊奇。 \n　　孙少安便一边叹气，一边简单地给他说了说自己的灾难。胡永合听后，嘴一撇，说：“这算个屁事！你这个人到如今还不开窍。我原来还以为你很有两手哩！你说，难处在什么地方？”胡永合口大气粗地问。 \n　　“这还要问哩！主要是资金嘛！”少安对他的朋友说。“要重新上马得多少？”少安看出。 \n　　胡永合似乎要对他慷慨解囊了。他在疑惑之中不免精神为之一振说：“大概得四千块……” \n　　“我知道哩，你这样情况，在咱县贷款是确有困难！” \n　　少安听胡永合这么一说，心里马上又凉了半截。“不过，”胡永合紧接着话茬，“我在原北县认识个朋友，先前我在那个县有点小生意，不愿倒腾本钱，想让他在当地给我贷三千块款，他一口就答应了，他已经在银行里说好了这笔贷款，后来我又决定不做那点生意了，主要是利太小，划不来……这样吧！我给那人写封信，你去把这笔款贷了。你看怎样？” \n　　孙少安一下子激动得不知如何是好。他又一次握住了胡永合的手，说：“\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>孙少安<|>PERSON<|>孙少安 is a culturally aware farmer who faces
