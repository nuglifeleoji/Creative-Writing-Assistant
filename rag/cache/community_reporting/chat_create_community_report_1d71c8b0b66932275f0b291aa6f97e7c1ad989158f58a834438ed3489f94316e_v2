Led by the cunning and oppressive **Baron Vladimir Harkonnen**, the Harkonnens are sworn enemies of the Atreides, responsible for orchestrating the attack on **Arrakis**, the death of **Duke Leto Atreides**, and the capture of **Jessica and Paul Atreides**. Their seat of power is **Giedi Prime**, though they also ruled **Arrakis** with an iron fist, exploiting its resources—particularly the valuable spice—and oppressing the native **Fremen**, whom they frequently clashed with.  \n\nThe Harkonnens are known for their military prowess, employing advanced weaponry like **lasguns** and mercenaries, sometimes disguised as Fremen, to further their schemes. Their cruelty extends beyond warfare; they are infamous for their oppressive governance, conducting raids, and eliminating threats such as **Liet-Kynes**. Their influence persists even in later eras, as remnants of their legacy linger in places like **Gammu** and the **no-globe**.  \n\nHistorically, the Harkonnens have been a dominant force in imperial politics, engaging in vendettas, betrayals, and manipulations to secure power, including ambitions for the imperial throne. Key figures like **Feyd-Rautha** exemplify their ruthless nature. Their enmity with the Atreides is deeply personal, rooted in blood feuds and strategic rivalries, making them central antagonists in the conflicts surrounding **Arrakis** and the rise of **Muad'Dib**. Despite their eventual downfall, their legacy of cruelty and ambition remains a dark stain on the Imperium's history.\",33\r\n301,BATTLE OF ARRAKEEN,\"The **Battle of Arrakeen** is the climactic conflict in which the Fremen, led by Paul Atreides (also known as Paul-Muad'Dib), confront and ultimately defeat the combined forces of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and his elite Sardaukar troops. The battle marks the culmination of Paul's rise to power and his rebellion against the Imperial forces. While one description frames it as an impending conflict, the other confirms its outcome, clarifying that the Fremen emerge victorious. This pivotal engagement solidifies Paul's control over Arrakis and the spice trade, reshaping the political landscape of the universe. The Battle of Arrakeen is a defining moment in the struggle for dominance over the desert planet and its invaluable resources.\",6\r\n31,SARDAUKAR,\"The **Sardaukar** are the elite military force of the **Padishah Emperor**, serving **House Corrino** with unwavering loyalty. Renowned for their brutal efficiency, combat prowess, and ruthless training, they are feared across the **Imperium**. Their origins trace back to the harsh prison planet **Salusa Secundus**, where oppressive conditions forge their unmatched discipline and lethality.  \n\nHistorically, the Sardaukar played a pivotal role in enforcing Imperial will, including covert operations and direct combat. They were instrumental in the **attack on House Atreides**, disguising themselves as **Harkonnen troops** to maintain plausible deniability for the Emperor. Their involvement extended to the capture of key figures like **Duncan Idaho**, **Thufir Hawat**, and **Kynes**, showcasing their political and military influence.  \n\nDespite their fearsome reputation, the Sardaukar faced significant defeats at the hands of the **Fremen**, particularly under **Paul Atreides'** leadership. These losses marked a turning point, diminishing their dominance and forcing retreats in key battles. Under **Farad’n Corrino**, efforts were made to restore their former strength, reflecting their enduring legacy as the terror of the Imperium.  \n\nTheir loyalty remains strictly to the **Imperial throne**, though their methods—brutality, deception, and overwhelming force—have made them both revered and reviled. Whether aiding allies like the Harkonnens or confronting enemies like the Fremen, the Sardaukar embody the Emperor’s absolute power, even as their supremacy wanes in the face of shifting galactic dynamics.\",34\r\n51,SALUSA SECUNDUS,\"**Salusa Secundus** is a historically significant and harsh planet, often compared to Arrakis in terms of its severity. It serves as the original homeworld of House Corrino and the training ground for the elite Sardaukar troops, renowned for their combat prowess. The planet is also known for its Laza tigers and its barren, oppressive conditions, which make it an ideal environment for military conditioning.  \n\nDesignated as the Imperial Prison Planet, Salusa Secundus has long been used as a place of exile and punishment by the Imperium. It was the site where Emperor Shaddam IV was exiled by Paul Atreides and later became the seat of House Corrino under Farad’n, who sought to restore the Sardaukar's strength. The planet is central to political intrigue, serving as the court of Farad’n and a hub for scheming, including plots by Princess Wensicia and Tyekanik.  \n\nSalusa Secundus holds cultural and religious significance as well, being a location where sacred texts such as the Tawrah and Talmudic Zabur survived. It is also associated with The Preacher’s activities and was reportedly the prison of Jessica Atreides, as revealed by Namri. Additionally, it is mentioned as the homeworld of Nyshae’s family.  \n\nDespite its brutal environment, Salusa Secundus remains a symbol of Corrino power and resilience, referenced as both a former prison world and a strategic military stronghold.

Tasked with eliminating Muad'Dib and his followers, Aramsham was eventually captured by Paul and the Fedaykin during their conflict. Despite his capture, he initially resisted Paul's authority, demonstrating his unwavering allegiance to the Emperor. As a high-ranking Sardaukar, Aramsham embodies the fierce discipline and combat prowess characteristic of the Emperor's elite forces.

At its heart lies a massive black rectangular structure made of plasteel, a remnant of the Harkonnen era, which serves as a stark centerpiece amidst the city's chaotic expanse. This imposing edifice, often a symbol of the Harkonnens' oppressive legacy, evokes strong emotions, including hatred from figures such as Duncan Idaho. Despite its modern developments, Barony retains its historical significance as both an organizing landmark and a reminder of the planet's tumultuous past under Harkonnen rule.
