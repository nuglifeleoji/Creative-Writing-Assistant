Historically, they are remembered for their oppressive rule over **Giedi Prime (Gammu)**, where they engaged in slavery and cruelty, leaving a dark legacy that persists in cultural memory. Their seat of power, the **Barony**, is located in **Ysai**, and their influence has contributed to the chaotic state of regions like **Gammu**.  \n\nThe Harkonnens are primary antagonists in the conflict for control of **Arrakis**, the desert planet rich in the valuable spice **melange**. They orchestrated the **attack on Arrakeen**, leading to the death of **Duke Leto Atreides**, and were responsible for the **betrayal and capture of Jessica and Paul Atreides**. Their rule over Arrakis is marked by exploitation and oppression, making them bitter enemies of the **Fremen** and **Liet-Kynes**, whom they wounded and later killed.  \n\nLed by the cunning and sadistic **Baron Vladimir Harkonnen**, the family employs **mercenaries, advanced weaponry (including lasguns), and deceitful tactics**, such as disguising their forces as Fremen. They are also implicated in political machinations, including infiltrating rival factions and manipulating events to weaken the Atreides.  \n\nThough ultimately defeated by **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)** during the **Jihad**, their legacy of cruelty and ambition endures. Their remnants and influence linger in historical accounts, no-globes, and the collective memory of those who suffered under their rule. House Harkonnen remains a symbol of tyranny, ruthlessness, and the destructive pursuit of power.\",48\n399,ARRAKIS AFFAIR,\"**The Arrakis Affair** was a significant political crisis on the desert planet Arrakis, involving key factions such as **House Atreides**, **House Harkonnen**, **Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)**, and the **Bene Gesserit**. The event sparked widespread suspicion within the **Landsraad**, the imperial feudal council, due to its destabilizing implications for power dynamics in the Known Universe.  \n\nThe conflict arose from tensions between **House Atreides** and **House Harkonnen**, two rival noble houses vying for control over Arrakis and its invaluable spice resources. The involvement of **Muad'Dib**, the messianic figure central to Fremen prophecy, further escalated the affair, as his rise challenged both the Harkonnens and the Bene Gesserit's secretive plans. The **Bene Gesserit**, a powerful sisterhood with deep political influence, played a covert role in the events, though their exact motives remain ambiguous.  \n\nTo mitigate the crisis and prevent broader unrest, **Count Fenring**, a trusted advisor to Emperor Shaddam IV, intervened by orchestrating a resolution through bribes and gifts to key members of the Landsraad. This diplomatic maneuvering helped quell immediate tensions, though the underlying rivalries and Muad'Dib's growing influence ensured lasting repercussions.  \n\nThe **Arrakis Affair** thus stands as a pivotal moment in the power struggles over Arrakis, blending political intrigue, factional conflict, and the machinations of secretive organizations. Its resolution through Fenring's intervention temporarily stabilized the situation but foreshadowed the larger upheavals to come in the Imperium.\",3\n247,ATTACK ON ATREIDES,The attack is a coordinated assault by the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to eliminate the Atreides family,2\n276,ATTACK ON ARRAKIS,A large-scale assault by Harkonnen and Sardaukar forces on House Atreides>,2\n205,ESCORT SERVICE,\"A front for smuggling and espionage operations, posing as a service for off-planet visitors.\"\"\",1\n237,CAPTURE OF JESSICA AND PAUL,\"The event where Jessica and Paul are captured by the Harkonnens through betrayal and deception, leading to their planned execution.\"\"\",1\n284,ATTACK ON ARRAKEEN,\"The attack on Arrakeen is the event where House Harkonnen, with the aid of the Sardaukar, destroys House Atreides' base, killing Duke Leto and forcing Paul and Jessica to flee.\"\"\",1\n502,KULON,\"Domesticated desert asses used by smugglers, representing a logistical event>\",1\n1764,SHIELDING,\"Shielding refers to Harkonnen protective technology mentioned in Duncan's memories.\"\"\",1\n1798,BARONY,\"**BARONY** is a sprawling city on the planet Gammu, historically known as the ancient Harkonnen seat and now referred to as Ysai. The city is characterized by its dense urban layout, designed to maximize population capacity, and features advanced infrastructure such as suspensor guide-beams for efficient transport. At its heart lies a massive black rectangular structure made of plasteel, a remnant of the Harkonnen era, which serves as a stark centerpiece amidst the city's chaotic expanse. This imposing edifice, often a symbol of the Harkonnens' oppressive legacy, evokes strong emotions, including hatred from figures such as Duncan Idaho. Despite its modern developments, Barony retains its historical significance as both an organizing landmark and a reminder of the planet's tumultuous past under Harkonnen rule.
