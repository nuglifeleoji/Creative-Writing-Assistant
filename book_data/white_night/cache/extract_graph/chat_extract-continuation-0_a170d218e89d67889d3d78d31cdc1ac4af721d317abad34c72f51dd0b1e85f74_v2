 “嗤嗤嗤！”\n\n    惨叫声突然此起彼伏的响起。\n\n    南澄脸色一白，直接抱着蓝轩宇就在一张蹦床上扑倒了下来。\n\n    虽然她不是战斗人员，可魂导射线枪的声音还是听的出来的啊！\n\n    惨叫声响起，一道道光束在黑暗的蹦床馆内纵横交错。\n\n    听到惨叫声，蓝轩宇不禁更有些害怕了，紧紧的搂着南澄。南澄将儿子压在身下，蹦床柔软，自然不会伤害到蓝轩宇，她用自己的身体保护着儿子，同时一层冰层也随之覆盖全身，保护住自己。\n------------\n\n第五十二章 妈妈，我有点害怕\n\n    恐怖袭击！\n\n    这是她此时脑海中唯一能够想到的，而此时此刻，她的大脑也有些空白。这也是她有生以来第一次遇到这样的情况啊！\n\n    她后悔了，后悔为什么没有坚持一下，请娜娜老师一起来。那可是一位封号斗罗层次的强者啊！现在就算通知她也来不及了，更何况，娜娜自从来了之后一直都在，她却没有娜娜的魂导通讯器联系方式。\n\n    “妈妈！我有点害怕。”蓝轩宇蜷缩在母亲怀中。\n\n    “别怕，妈妈会保护你的。”儿子的话给了南澄莫大的勇气。无论怎样，自己都要保护好儿子的周全才是。\n\n    一想到这里，南澄的大脑就清醒了许多。\n\n    恐怖分子袭击天际大厦，这座一百多层的大厦之中，少说也有上万人。蹦床馆应该不会是特别重要的目标才对。与其到处乱闯，倒不如先隐藏在这里，紫萝城警察肯定会很快发现这里的不对，现在等待救援才是最好的选择。\n\n    蹦床因为重量向下略微塌陷，所以他们现在是低于地面高度的，魂导射线虽然偶尔有从上方掠过，但还落不到这里。\n\n    惨叫声减少了许多，一个冰冷的声音通过魂导扩音器传来。\n\n    “所有的人，全部不许移动，移动着杀！”\n\n    有了先前的一番杀戮，虽然不知道有多少人伤亡，毫无疑问，这里的人全都被震慑住了。\n\n    一时间，孩子们的哭喊声，呻吟声响成一片。\n\n    南澄有些急促的呼吸着，紧紧的搂着怀中的蓝轩宇，唯恐被注意到。就在这时，几声嗡鸣响起，隐约中，她似乎感觉到有什么东西飞了起来，下一瞬，一道道光束突然从天而降，照耀在蹦床馆内。\n\n    南澄抬头看去，只见那是一个个身穿微型机甲的人，悬浮在半空之中，�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
