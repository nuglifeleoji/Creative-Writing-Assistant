绍军约退三十余里，操遣将出营巡哨。有徐晃部将史涣获得袁军细作，解见徐晃。晃问其军中虚实。答曰：“早晚大将韩猛运粮至军前接济，先令我等探路。”徐晃便将此事报知曹操。荀攸曰：“韩猛匹夫之勇耳。若遣一人引轻骑数千，从半路击之，断其粮草，绍军自乱。”操曰：“谁人可往？”攸曰：“即遣徐晃可也。”操遂差徐晃将带史涣并所部兵先出，后使张辽、许褚引兵救应。当夜韩猛押粮车数千辆，解赴绍寨。正走之间，山谷内徐晃、史涣引军截住去路。韩猛飞马来战，徐晃接住厮杀。史涣便杀散人夫，放火焚烧粮车。韩猛抵当不住，拨回马走。徐晃催军烧尽辎重。袁绍军中，望见西北上火起，正惊疑间，败军投来：“粮草被劫！”绍急遣张邰、高览去截大路，正遇徐晃烧粮而回，恰欲交锋，背后张辽、许诸军到。两下夹攻，杀散袁军，四将合兵一处，回官渡寨中。曹操大喜，重加赏劳。又分军于寨前结营，为掎角之势。\n\n
