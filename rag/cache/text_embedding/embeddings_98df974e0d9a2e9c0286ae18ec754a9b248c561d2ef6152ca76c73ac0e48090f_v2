The cars went swishing past on their\nsuspensors, the dirty slush flying from under their fanskirts and peppering the bushes along the road. Burzmali held her down beside him in the snow until he was sure the cars were out of sight and sound. Not that anyone riding in them could hear much except their own whirling passage.\nThey had been walking for two hours before Burzmali stopped and took stock of the way ahead. Their destination was a perimeter community that had been described to them as “completely safe.” Lucilla knew better. No place on Gammu was completely safe.\nYellow lights cast an undershot glow on the clouds ahead of them, marking the location of the community. Their slushy progress took them through a tunnel under the perimeter road and up a low hill planted to some sort of orchard. The limbs were stark in the dim light.\nLucilla glanced upward. The clouds were thinning. Gammu had many small moons—fortress no-ships. Some of them had been placed by Teg but she glimpsed lines of new ones sharing the guardian role. They appeared to be about four times the size of the brightest stars and they often traveled together, which made their reflected light useful but erratic because they moved fast—up across the sky and below the horizon in only a few hours. She glimpsed a string of six such moons through a break in the clouds, wondering if they were part of Teg’s defense system.\nMomentarily, she reflected on the inherent weakness of the siege mentality that such defenses represented. Teg had been right about them. Mobility was the key to military success but she doubted that he had meant mobility on foot.\nThere were no easy hiding places on the snow-whitened Slope and Lucilla felt Burzmali’s nervousness. What could they do here if someone came? A snow-covered depression led down from their position to the left, angling toward the community. It was not a road but she thought it might be a path.\n“Down this way,” Burzmali said, leading them into the depression.\nThe snow came up to their calves.\n“| hope these people are trustworthy,” she said.\n“They hate the Honored Matres,” he said. “That’s enough for me.”\n“The ghola had better be there!” She held back an even more angry response but could not keep herself from adding: “Their hatred isn’t enough for me.”\nIt was better to expect the worst, she thought.\nShe had come to a reassuring thought about Burzmali, though. He was like Teg. Neither of them pursued a course that would lead them into a dead end—not if they could help it. She suspected there were support forces concealed in the bushes around them even now.\nThe snow-covered trail ended in a paved pathway, gently curved inward from the edges and kept free of snow by a melt system. There was a trickle of dampness in the center. Lucilla was several steps onto this path before she recognized what it must be—a magchute. It was an ancient magnetic transport base that once had carried goods or raw materials to a pre-Scattering factory.\n“It gets steeper here,” Burzmali warned her. “They’ve carved steps in it but watch it. They’re not very deep.”\nThey came presently to the end of the magchute. It stopped at a decrepit wall—local brick atop a plasteel foundation. The faint light of stars in a clearing sky revealed crude workmanship in the bricks—typical Famine-Times construction. The wall was a mass of vines and mottled fungus. The growth did little to conceal the cracked courses of the bricks and the crude efforts to fill chinks with mortar. A single row of narrow windows looked down onto the place where the magchute debouched into a mass of bushes and weeds. Three of the windows glowed electric blue with some inner activity that was accompanied by faint crackling sounds.\n“This was a factory in the old days,” Burzmali said.\n“I have eyes and a memory,” Lucilla snapped. Did this grunting male think her completely devoid of intelligence?\nSomething creaked dismally off to their left. A patch of sod and weeds lifted atop a cellar door accompanied by an upward glow of brilliant yellow light.\n“Quick!” Burzmali led her at a swift run across thick vegetation and down a flight of steps exposed by the lifting door. The door creaked closed behind them in a grumbling of machinery.\nLucilla found herself in a large space with a low ceiling. Light came from long lines of modern glowglobes strung along massive plasteel girders overhead. The floor was swept clean but showed scratches and indentations of activity, the locations no doubt of bygone machinery. She glimpsed movement far off across the open space. A young woman in a version of Lucilla’s dragon robe trotted toward them.\nLucilla sniffed. There was a stink of acid in the room and undertones of something foul.\n“This was a Harkonnen factory,” Burzmali said. “| wonder what they made here?”\nThe young woman stopped in front of Lucilla. She had a willowy figure, elegant in shape and motion under the clinging robe. A subcutaneous glow came from her face. It spoke of exercise and good health. The green eyes, though, were hard and chilling in the way they measured everything they saw.\n“So they sent more than one of us to watch this place,” she said.\nLucilla put out a restraining hand as Burzmali started to respond. This woman was not what she seemed. No more than I am! Lucilla chose her words carefully. “We always know each other, it seems.”\nThe young woman smiled. “I watched your approach. | could not believe my eyes.” She swept a sneering glance\nacross Burzmali. “This was supposed to be a customer?”\n“And guide,” Lucilla said. She noted the puzzlement on Burzmali’s face and prayed he would not ask the wrong question. This young woman was danger!\n“Weren't we expected?” Burzmali asked.\n“Ahhhh, it speaks,” the young woman said, laughing. Her laugh was as cold as her eyes.\n“| prefer that you do not refer to me as ‘it,’” Burzmali said.\n“I call Gammu scum anything | wish,” the young woman said. “Don’t speak to me of your preferences!”\n“What did you call me?” Burzmali was tired and his anger came boiling up at this unexpected attack.\n“I call you anything | choose, scum!”\nBurzmali had suffered enough. Before Lucilla could stop him, he uttered a low growl and aimed a heavy slap at the young woman.\nThe blow did not land.\nLucilla watched in fascination as the woman dropped under the attack, caught Burzmali’s sleeve as one might catch a bit of fabric blowing in the wind and, in a blindingly fast pirouette whose speed almost hid its delicacy, sent Burzmali skidding across the floor. The woman dropped to a half crouch on one foot, the other prepared to kick.\n“I shall kill him now,” she said.\nLucilla, not Knowing what might happen next, folded her body sideways, barely avoiding the woman’s suddenly outthrust foot, and countered with a standard Bene Gesserit sabard that dumped the young woman on her back doubled up where the blow had caught her in the abdomen.\n“A suggestion that you kill my guide is uncalled for, whatever your name is,” Lucilla said.\nThe young woman gasped for breath, then, panting between words: “I am called Murbella, Great Honored Matre. You shame me by defeating me with such a slow attack. Why do you do that?”\n“You needed a lesson,” Lucilla said.\n“Lam only newly robed, Great Honored Matre. Please forgive me. | thank you for the splendid lesson and will thank you every time | employ your response, which | now commit to memory.” She bowed her head, then leaped lightly to her feet, an impish grin on her face.\nIn her coldest voice, Lucilla asked: “Do you know who | am?” Out of the corners of her eyes, she saw Burzmali regain his feet with painful slowness. He remained at one side, watching the women, but anger burned his face.\n“From your ability to teach me that lesson, | see that you are who you are, Great Honored Matre. Am | forgiven?” The impish grin had vanished from Murbella’s face. She stood with head bowed.\n“You are forgiven. Is there a no-ship coming?”\n“So they say here. We are prepared for it.” Murbella glanced at Burzmali.\n“He is still useful to me and it is required that he accompany me,” Lucilla said.\n“Very good, Great Honored Matre. Does your forgiveness include your name?”\n“No!”\nMurbella sighed. “We have captured the ghola,” she said. “He came as a Tleilaxu from the south. | was just about to bed him when you arrived.”\nBurzmali hobbled toward them. Lucilla saw that he had recognized the danger. This “completely safe” place had been infested by enemies! But the enemies still knew very little.\n“The ghola was not injured?” Burzmali asked.\n“It still soeaks,” Murbella said. “How odd.”\n“You will not bed the ghola,” Lucilla said. “That one is my special charge!”\n“Fair game, Great Honored Matre. And | marked him first. He is already partly subdued.”\nShe laughed once more, with a callous abandonment that shocked Lucilla. “This way. There is a place where you can watch.”\nMay you die on Caladan!\n—ANCIENT DRINKING TOAST\nD uncan tried to remember where he was. He knew Tormsa was dead. Blood had spurted from Tormsa’s eyes. Yes, he remembered that clearly. They had entered a dark building and light had flared abruptly all around them. Duncan felt an ache in the back of his head. A blow? He tried to move and his muscles refused to obey.\nHe remembered sitting at the edge of a wide lawn. There was some kind of bowling game in progress— eccentric balls that bounced and darted with no apparent design. The players were young men in a common costume of... Giedi Prime!\n“They are practicing to be old men,” he said. He remembered saying that.\nHis companion, a young woman, looked at him blankly.\n“Only old men should play these outdoor games,” he said.\n“Oh?”\nIt was an unanswerable question. She put him down with only the simplest of verbal gestures.\nAnd betrayed me the next instant to the Harkonnens!\nSo that was a pre-ghola memory.\nGhola!\nHe remembered the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu. The library: holophotos and triphotos of the Atreides Duke, Leto |. Teg’s resemblance was not an accident: a bit taller but otherwise it was all there—that long, thin face with its high- bridged nose, the renowned Atreides charisma...\nTeg!\nHe remembered the old Bashar’s last gallant stand in the Gammu night.\nWhere am I?\nTormsa had brought him here. They had been moving along an overgrown track on the outskirts of Ysai. Barony. It started to snow before they were two hundred meters up the track. Wet snow that clung to them. Cold, miserable snow that set their teeth chattering within a minute. They paused to bring up their hoods and close the insulated jackets. That was better. But it would be night soon. Much colder.\n“There is a shelter of sorts up ahead,” Tormsa said. “We will wait there for the night.”\n", " on Gammu. The library: holophotos and triphotos of the Atreides Duke, Leto |.

They had been moving along an overgrown track on the outskirts of Ysai. Barony. It started to snow before they were two hundred meters up the track. Wet snow that clung to them. Cold, miserable snow that set their teeth chattering within a minute. They paused to bring up their hoods and close the insulated jackets. That was better. But it would be night soon. Much colder.\n“There is a shelter of sorts up ahead,” Tormsa said. “We will wait there for the night.”\nWhen Duncan did not speak, Tormsa said: “It won’t be warm but it will be dry.”\nDuncan saw the gray outline of the place in about three hundred paces. It stood out against the dirty snow some two stories tall. He recognized it immediately: a Harkonnen counting outpost. Observers here had counted (and sometimes killed) the people who passed. It was built of native dirt turned into one giant brick by the simple expedient of preforming it in mud bricks and then superheating it with a wide-bore burner, the kind the Harkonnens had used to control mobs.\nAs they came up to it, Duncan saw the remains of a full- field defensive screen with fire-lance gaps aimed at the approaches. Someone had smashed the system a long time ago. Twisted holes in the field net were partly overgrown with bushes. But the fire-lance gaps remained open. Oh, yes —to allow people inside a view of the approaches.\nTormsa paused and listened, studying their surroundings with care.\nDuncan looked at the counting station. He remembered them well. What confronted him was a thing that had sprouted like a deformed growth from an original tubular seed. The surface had been baked to a glassine finish. Warts\nand protrusions betrayed where it had been superheated. The erosion of eons had left fine scratches in it but the Original shape remained. He looked upward and identified part of the old suspensor lift system. Someone had jury- rigged a block and tackle to the outbar.\nSo the opening through the full-field screen was of recent making.\nTormsa disappeared into this opening.\nAs though a switch had been thrown, Duncan’s memory vision changed. He was in the no-globe’s library with Teg. The projector was producing a series of views through modern Ysai. The idea of modern took on an odd overtone for him. Barony had been a modern city, if you thought of modern as meaning technologically uniform up to the norms of its time. It had relied exclusively on suspensor guide- beams for transport of people and material—all of them high up. No ground-level openings. He was explaining this to Teg.\nThe plan translated physically into a city that used every possible square meter of vertical and horizontal space for things other than movement of goods and humans. The guide-beam openings required only enough head room and elbow room for the universal transport pods.\nTeg spoke: “The ideal shape would be tubular with a flat top for the ‘thopters.”\n“The Harkonnens preferred squares and rectangles.”\nThat was true.\nDuncan remembered Barony with a clearness that made him shiver. Suspensor tracks shot through it like worm holes —straight, curved, flipping off at oblique angles... up, down, sideways. Except for the rectangular absolute imposed by Harkonnen whim, Barony was built to a particular population-design criterion: maximum stuffing with minimum expenditure of materials.\n“The flat top was the only human-oriented space in the damned thing!” He remembered telling that to Teg and\nLucilla both.\nUp there on top were penthouses, guard stations at all the edges, at the ’thopter pads, at all the entries from below, around all of the parks. People living on the top could forget about the mass of flesh squirming in close proximity just below them. No smell or noise from that jumble was allowed on top. Servants were forced to bathe and change into sanitary clothing before emerging.\nTeg had a question: “Why did that massed humanity permit itself to live in such a crush?”\nThe answer was obvious and he explained it. The outside was a dangerous place. The city’s managers made it appear even more dangerous than it actually was. Besides, few in there knew anything about a better life Outside. The only better life they knew about was on top. And the only way up there was through an absolutely abasing servility.\n“It will happen and there’s nothing you can do about it!”\nThat was another voice echoing in Duncan’s skull. He heard it clearly.\nPaul!\nHow odd it was, Duncan thought. There was an arrogance in the prescient like the arrogance of the Mentat seated in his most brittle logic.\nI never before thought of Paul as arrogant.\nDuncan stared at his own face in a mirror. He realized with part of his mind that this was a pre-ghola memory. Abruptly, it was another mirror, his own face but different. That darkly rounded face had begun to shape into the harsher lines it could have if it matured. He looked into his own eyes. Yes, those were his eyes. He had heard someone describe his eyes once as “cave sitters.” They were deeply inset under the brows and riding atop high cheeks. He had been told it was difficult to determine if his eyes were dark blue or dark green unless the light were just right.\nA woman said that. He could not remember the woman.\nHe tried to reach up and touch his hair but his hands would not obey. He remembered then that his hair had been bleached. Who did that? An old woman. His hair was no longer a cap of dark ringlets.\nThere was the Duke Leto staring at him in the doorway to the dining room on Caladan.\n“We will eat now,” the Duke said. It was a royal command saved from arrogance by a faint grin that said: “Somebody had to say it.”\nWhat is happening to my mind?\nHe remembered following Tormsa to the place where Tormsa said the no-ship would meet them.\nIt was a large building bulking in the night. There were several smaller outbuildings below the larger structure. They appeared to be occupied. Voices and machine sounds could be heard in them. No faces showed at the narrow windows. No door opened. Duncan smelled cooking as they passed the larger of the outbuildings. This reminded him that they had only eaten dry strips of leathery stuff that Tormsa called “travel food” that day.\nThey entered the dark building.\nLight flared.\nTormsa’s eyes exploded in blood.\nDarkness.\nDuncan looked at a woman’s face. He had seen a face like this one before: a single tride taken from a longer holo sequence. Where was that? Where had he seen that? It was an almost oval face with just a small widening at the brow to mar its curved perfection.\nShe spoke: “My name is Murbella. You will not remember that but | share it now as | mark you. | have selected you.”\nI do remember you, Murbella.\nGreen eyes set wide under arched brows gave her features a focal region that left chin and small mouth for later examination. The mouth was full-lipped and he knew it could become pouting in repose.\nThe green eyes stared into his eyes. How cold that look. The power in it.\nSomething touched his cheek.\nHe opened his eyes. This was no memory! This was happening to him. It was happening now!\nMurbella! She had been here and she had left him. Now she was back. He remembered awakening naked on a soft surface ...a sleeping pad. His hands recognized it. Murbella unclothed just above him, green eyes staring at him with a terrible intensity. She touched him simultaneously in many places. A soft humming issued from between her lips.\nHe felt the swift erection, painful in its rigidity.\nNo power of resistance remained in him. Her hands moved over his body. Her tongue. The humming! All around him, her mouth touching him. The nipples of her breasts grazed his cheeks, his chest. When he saw her eyes, he saw conscious design.\nMurbella had returned and she was doing it once more!\nOver her right shoulder, he glimpsed a wide plaz window —Lucilla and Burzmali behind that barrier. A dream? Burzmali pressed his palms against the plaz. Lucilla stood with folded arms, a look of mingled rage and curiosity on her face.\nMurbella murmured in his right ear: “My hands are fire.”\nHer body hid the faces behind the plaz. He felt the fire wherever she touched him.\nAbruptly, the flame engulfed his mind. Hidden places within him came alive. He saw red capsules like a string of gleaming sausages passing before his eyes. He felt feverish. He was an engorged capsule, excitement flaring throughout his awareness. Those capsules! He knew them! They were himself... they were...\nAll of the Duncan Idahos, original and the serial gholas flowed into his mind. They were like bursting seedpods\ndenying all other existence except themselves. He saw himself crushed beneath a great worm with a human face.\n“Damn you, Leto!”\nCrushed and crushed and crushed... time and again.\n“Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!.. .”\nHe died under a Sardaukar sword. Pain exploded into a bright glare swallowed by darkness.\nHe died in a ‘thopter crash. He died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin. He died and died and died.\nAnd he lived.\nThe memories flooded him until he wondered how he could hold them all. The sweetness of a newborn daughter held in his arms. The musky odors of a passionate mate. The cascade of flavors from a fine Danian wine. The panting exertions of the practice floor.\nThe axlotl tanks!\nHe remembered emerging time after time: bright lights and padded mechanical hands. The hands rotated him and, in the unfocused blurs of the newborn, he saw a great mound of female flesh—monstrous in her almost immobile grossness...a maze of dark tubes linked her body to giant metal containers.\nAxlotl tank?\nHe gasped in the grip of the serial memories that cascaded into him. Al/ of those lives! All of those lives!\nNow, he remembered what the Tleilaxu had planted in him, the submerged awareness that awaited only this moment of seduction by a Bene Gesserit Imprinter.\nBut this was Murbella and she was not Bene Gesserit.\nShe was here, though, ready at hand and the Tleilaxu pattern took over his reactions.\nDuncan hummed softly and touched her, moving with an agility that shocked Murbella. He should not be this responsive! Not this way! His right hand fluttered against the lips of her vagina while his left hand caressed the base of her spine. At the same time, his mouth moved gently\nover her nose, down to her lips, down to the crease of her left armpit.\nAnd all the time he hummed softly in a rhythm that pulsed through her body, lulling ... weakening...\nShe tried to push away from him as he increased the pace of her responses.\nHow did he know to touch me there at just that instant? And there! And there! Oh, Holy Rock of Dur, how does he know this?\nDuncan marked the", "it Imprinter.\nBut this was Murbella and she was not Bene Gesserit.\nShe was here, though, ready at hand and the Tleilaxu pattern took over his reactions.\nDuncan hummed softly and touched her, moving with an agility that shocked Murbella.

And there! And there! Oh, Holy Rock of Dur, how does he know this?\nDuncan marked the swelling of her breasts and saw the congestion in her nose. He saw the way her nipples stood out stiffly, the areolae darkening around them. She moaned and spread her legs wide.\nGreat Matre, help me!\nBut the only Great Matre she could think of was locked securely away from this room, restrained by a bolted door and a plaz barrier.\nDesperate energy flowed into Murbella. She responded in the only way she knew: touching, caressing—using all of the techniques she had learned so carefully in the long years of her apprenticeship.\nTo each thing she did, Duncan produced a wildly stimulating countermove.\nMurbella found that she no longer could control all of her own responses. She was reacting automatically from some well of knowledge deeper than her training. She felt her vaginal muscles tighten. She felt the swift release of lubricant fluid. When Duncan entered her she heard herself groan. Her arms, her hands, her legs, her entire body moved with both of the response systems—well-trained automation and the deeper, deeper plunging awareness of other demands.\nHow did he do this to me?\nWaves of ecstatic contractions began in the smooth muscles of her pelvis. She sensed his simultaneous response and felt the hard slap of his ejaculation. This\nheightened her own response. Ecstatic pulsations drove outward from the contractions in her vagina... outward... outward. The ecstasy engulfed her entire sensorium. She Saw a Spreading blaze of whiteness against her eyelids. Every muscle quivered with an ecstasy she had not imagined possible for herself.\nAgain, the waves spread outward.\nAgain and again...\nShe lost count of the repetitions.\nWhen Duncan moaned, she moaned and the waves swept outward once more.\nAnd again...\nThere was no sensation of time or surroundings, only this immersion in a continuing ecstasy.\nShe wanted it to go on forever and she wanted it to stop. This should not be happening to a female! An Honored Matre must not experience this. These were the sensations by which men were governed.\nDuncan emerged from the response pattern that had been implanted in him. There was something else he was Supposed to do. He could not remember what it was.\nLucilla?\nHe imagined her dead in front of him. But this woman was not Lucilla; this was... this was Murbella.\nThere was very little strength in him. He lifted himself off Murbella and managed to sink back onto his knees. Her hands were fluttering in an agitation he could not understand.\nMurbella tried to push Duncan away from her and he was not there. Her eyes snapped open.\nDuncan knelt above her. She had no idea how much time had passed. She tried to find the energy to sit up and failed. Slowly, reason returned.\nShe stared into Duncan’s eyes, knowing now who this man must be. Man? He was only a youth. But he had done things... things... All of the Honored Matres had been\nwarned. There was a ghola armed with forbidden knowledge by the Tleilaxu. That ghola must be killed!\nA small burst of energy surged into her muscles. She raised herself on her elbows. Gasping for breath, she tried to roll away from him and fell back to the soft surface.\nBy the Holy Rock of Dur! This male could not be permitted to live! He was a ghola and he could do things permitted only to Honored Matres. She wanted to strike out at him and, at the same time, she wanted to pull him back onto her body. The ecstasy! She knew that whatever he asked of her at this moment she would do. She would do it for him.\nNo! I must kill him!\nOnce more, she raised herself onto her elbows and, from there, managed to sit up. Her weakened gaze crossed the window where she had confined the Great Honored Matre and the guide. They still stood there looking at her. The man’s face was flushed. The face of the Great Honored Matre was as unmoving as the Rock of Dur itself.\nHow can she just stand there after what she has seen here? The Great Honored Matre must kill this ghola!\nMurbella beckoned to the woman behind the plaz and rolled toward the locked door beside the sleeping pad. She barely managed to unbolt and open the door before falling back. Her eyes looked up at the kneeling youth. Sweat glistened on his body. His lovely body...\nNo!\nDesperation drove her off onto the floor. She was on her knees there and then, mostly by will power, she stood. Energy was returning but her legs trembled as she staggered around the foot of the sleeping pad.\n/ will do it myself without thinking. | must do it.\nHer body swayed from side to side. She tried to steady herself and aimed a blow at his neck. She knew this blow from long hours of practice. It would crush the larynx. The victim would die of asphyxiation.\nDuncan dodged the blow easily, but he was slow .. . slow.\nMurbella almost fell beside him but the hands of the Great Honored Matre saved her.\n“Kill him,” Murbella gasped. “He’s the one we were warned about. He’s the one!”\nMurbella felt hands on her neck, the fingers pressing fiercely at the nerve bundles beneath the ears.\nThe last thing Murbella heard before unconsciousness was the Great Honored Matre saying: “We will kill no one. This ghola goes to Rakis.”\nThe worst potential competition for any organism can come from its own kind. The species consumes necessities. Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in the least amount. The least favorable condition controls the rate of growth. (Law of the Minimum)\n—FROM “LESSONS OF ARRAKIS”\nhe building stood back from a wide avenue behind a\nscreen of trees and carefully tended flowering hedges. The hedges had been staggered in a maze pattern with man-high white posts to define the planted areas. No vehicle entering or leaving could do so at any speed above a slow crawl. Teg’s military awareness took all of this in as the armored groundcar carried him up to the door. Field Marshal Muzzafar, the only other occupant in the rear of the car, recognized Teg’s assessment and said:\n“We're protected from above by a beam enfilading system.”\nA soldier in camouflage uniform with a long lasgun ona sling over one shoulder opened the door and snapped to attention as Muzzafar emerged.\nTeg followed. He recognized this place. It was one of the “safe” addresses Bene Gesserit Security had provided for him. Obviously, the Sisterhood’s information was out of date. Recently out of date, though, because Muzzafar gave no indication that Teg might know this place.\nAs they crossed to the door, Teg noted that another protective system he had seen on his first tour of Ysai remained intact. It was a barely noticeable difference in the posts along the trees-and-hedges barriers. Those posts were scanlyzers operated from a room somewhere in the building. Their diamond-shaped connectors “read” the area between\nthem and the building. At the gentle push of a button in the watchers’ room, the scanlyzers would make small chunks of meat out of any living flesh crossing their fields.\nAt the door, Muzzafar paused and looked at Teg. “The Honored Matre you are about to meet is the most powerful of all who have come here. She does not tolerate anything but complete obedience.”\n“I take it that you are warning me.”\n“I thought you would understand. Call her Honored Matre. Nothing else. In we go. I’ve taken the liberty of having a new uniform made for you.”\nThe room where Muzzafar ushered him was one Teg had not seen on his previous visit. Small and crammed with ticking black-paneled boxes, it left little room for the two of them. A single yellow glowglobe at the ceiling illuminated the place. Muzzafar crowded himself into a corner while Teg got out of the grimed and wrinkled singlesuit he had worn since the no-globe.\n“Sorry | can’t offer you a bath as well,” Muzzafar said. “But we must not delay. She gets impatient.”\nA different personality came over Teg with the uniform. It was a familiar black garment, even to the starbursts at the collar. So he was to appear before this Honored Matre as the Sisterhood’s Bashar. Interesting. He was once more completely the Bashar, not that this powerful sense of identity had ever left him. The uniform completed it and announced it, though. In this garment there was no need to emphasize in any other way precisely who he was.\n“That’s better,” Muzzafar said as he led Teg out into the entry hallway and through a door Teg remembered. Yes, this was where he had met the “safe” contacts. He had recognized the room’s function then and nothing appeared to have changed it. Rows of microscopic comeyes lined the intersection of ceiling and walls, disguised as silver guide Strips for the hovering glowglobes.\nThe one who is watched does not see, Teg thought. And the Watchers have a billion eyes.\nHis doubled vision told him there was danger here but nothing immediately violent.\nThis room, about five meters long and four wide, was a place for doing very high-level business. The merchandise would never be an actual exposure of money. People here would see only portable equivalents of whatever passed for currency—melange, perhaps, or milky soostones about the size of an eyeball, perfectly round, at once glossy and soft in appearance but radiant with rainbow changes directed by whatever light fell on them or whatever flesh they touched. This was a place where a danikin of melange or a small fold- pouch of soostones would be accepted as a natural occurrence. The price of a planet could be exchanged here with only a nod, an eyeblink or a low-voiced murmur. No wallets of currency would ever be produced here. The closest thing might be a thin case of translux out of whose poison-guarded interior would come thinner sheets of ridulian crystal with very large numbers inscribed on them by unforgeable dataprint.\n“This is a bank,” Teg said.\n“What?” Muzzafar had been staring at the closed door in the opposite wall. “Oh, yes. She’ll be along presently.”\n“She is watching us now, of course.”\nMuzzafar did not answer but he looked gloomy.\nTeg glanced around him. Had anything been changed since his previous visit? He saw no significant alterations. He wondered if shrines such as this one had undergone much change at all over the eons. There was a dewcarpet on the floor as soft as brantdown and as white as the underbelly of a fur whale.
