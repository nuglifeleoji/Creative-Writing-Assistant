米，割几斤羊肉，“打平伙”吃一顿小米羊肉丁子饭。另有一些爱红火热闹的人，等不到正月里闹秧歌，现在就聚在一块吹拉弹唱，闹得不亦乐乎；某些破窑洞里不时传出悠扬的丝弦声和庄稼人的欢歌笑语…… \n　　双水村一片歌舞升平景象。 \n　　就在这个时候，一件相当神秘的事正暗中在这个村庄进行着。 \n　　这件事的主角是神汉刘玉升。 \n　　双水村的这位“精神领袖”最近被北方一个以搞迷信活动著称的大寺庙任命为这一带的头领，负责收缴为神鬼许下口愿的老百姓的布施。这使刘玉升在无形中增强了自己在公众中的权威。现在谁也不知道这家伙在暗中搜刮了多少愚昧庄稼人的钱财。据有人估计，他足可以和著名的财主孙少安一争高低。 \n　　神汉也有乡土观念。刘玉升在一两月前突然萌发了一个宏大抱负；他要为双水村做件好事，把庙坪那个破庙重新修复起来，续上断了多年的香火，他准备自己拿出一部分浮财，另外让村民们以布施的方式每家再出一点钱，一定要把这座庙修得比原来更堂皇！ \n　　实际上，刘玉升是以凡人的心理谋划他的“壮举”的：他要在双水村的历史上留下他自己的一座纪念碑。他立刻成立了一个“庙会”，自任“会长”，同时挑选金光亮任他的“副会长”。 \n　　金光亮对这个职务受宠若惊又深感荣幸。作为地主的儿子，他生不逢时，这辈子大部分时间在村里一直是“人下人”；别说当什么领导人了，当个平顶子老百姓都不得安生。政策松宽后，虽然头抬起了一些，但在村里还不是受制于人？人家让他刨庙坪的泡桐树，他只得刨掉……好，他现在成了“副会长”，虽然共产党不承认这个官，但许多老百姓承认哩！哼，让他也坐上几天官位！ \n　　光亮自“意大利”蜂跑掉，又被村中的党支部勒令刨掉庙坪的泡桐树后，灰了一段日子。 \n　　后来，他用积攒的钱，又买了几箱蜂。不过，他没敢再买该死的“外国蜂”，而买的是“东北黑蜂”。当然，他并不知道，“东北黑蜂”也属于西方蜜蜂的品系。 \n　　重新买了“国产蜂”，又当了“副会长”，使得光亮再次“光亮”起来。另外，他感到腰硬的是，他还是个“革命军属”——他的二锤都在南方的国界上立了功哩！ \n　　这些日子里，金光亮动不动就神气地淌过东拉河，到田家圪崂这面来，一整天钻进刘玉升昏暗无光的黑窑洞里，筹划在庙�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>双水村<|>GEO<|>双水村 is a village where a
