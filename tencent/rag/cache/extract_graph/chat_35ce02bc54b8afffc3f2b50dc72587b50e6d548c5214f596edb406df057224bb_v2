But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river.”\nThe Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the two Guildsmen.\n“Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling,” Paul said. “There are other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once they’ve used the spice liquor, the others no longer work.”\nThe old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward out of the crowd to Stand at the barrier lances.\n“Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,” Paul said. “It has been a long time since Caladan, hasn't it?”\nShe looked past him at his mother, said: “Well, Jessica, | see that your son is indeed the one. For that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your daughter.”\nPaul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: “You’ve never had the right or cause to forgive my mother anything!”\nThe old woman locked eyes with him.\n“Try your tricks on me, old witch,” Paul said. “Where’s your gom jabbar? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there staring out at you!”\nThe old woman dropped her gaze.\n“Have you nothing to say?” Paul demanded.\n“I welcomed you to the ranks of humans,” she muttered. “Don’t besmirch that.”\nPaul raised his voice: “Observe her, comrades! This is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the one person their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here | stand...But...I...will...qever...do...her... bidding!”\n“Jessica!” the old woman screamed. “Silence him!”\n“Silence him yourself,” Jessica said.\nPaul glared at the old woman. “For your part in all this | could gladly have you strangled,” he said. “You couldn’t prevent it!” he snapped as she stiffened in rage. “But | think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires.”\n“Jessica, what have you done?” the old woman demanded.\n“FIL give you only one thing,” Paul said. “You saw part of what the race needs, but how poorly you saw it. You think to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to your master plan! How little you understand of what—”\n“You mustn't speak of these things!” the old woman hissed.\n“Silence!” Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them\nunder Paul’s control.\nThe old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her, face blank with shock at the power with which he had seized her psyche. “Jessica,” she whispered. “Jessica.”\n“I remember your gom jabbar,” Paul said. “You remember mine. | can kill you with a word.”\nThe Fremen around the hall glanced knowingly at each other. Did the legend not say: “And his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against righteousness.”\nPaul turned his attention to the tall Princess Royal Standing beside her Emperor father. Keeping his eyes focused on her, he said: “Majesty, we both know the way out of our difficulty.”\nThe Emperor glanced at his daughter, back to Paul. “You dare? You! An adventurer without family, a nobody from—”\n“You've already admitted who | am,” Paul said. “Royal kinsman, you said. Let’s stop this nonsense.”\n“lam your ruler,” the Emperor said.\nPaul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment and facing him. One of them nodded.\n“I could force it,” Paul said.\n“You will not dare!” the Emperor grated.\nPaul merely stared at him.\nThe Princess Royal put a hand on her father’s arm. “Father,” she said, and her voice was silky soft, soothing.\n“Don’t try your tricks on me,” the Emperor said. He looked at her. “You don’t need to do this,\nDaughter. We’ve other resources that—”\n“But here’s a man fit to be your son,” she said.\nThe old Reverend Mother, her composure regained, forced her way to the Emperor’s side, leaned close to his ear and whispered.\n“She pleads your case,” Jessica said.\nPaul continued to look at the golden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother, he said: “That’s Irulan, the oldest, isn’t it?”\n“Yes,”\nChani moved up on Paul’s other side, said: “Do you wish me to leave, Muad’Dib?”\nHe glanced at her. “Leave? You'll never again leave my side.”\n“There’s nothing binding between us,” Chani said.\nPaul looked down at her for a silent moment, then: “Speak only truth with me, my Sihaya.” As she started to reply, he silenced her with a finger to her lips. “That which binds us cannot be loosed,” he said. “Now, watch these matters closely for | wish to see this room later through your wisdom.”\nThe Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a heated, low-voiced argument.\nPaul spoke to his mother: “She reminds him that it’s part of their agreement to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne, and Irulan is the one they’ve groomed for it.”\n“Was that their plan?” Jessica said.\n“Isn't it obvious?” Paul asked.\n“I see the signs!” Jessica snapped. “My question was meant to remind you that you should not try to teach me those matters in which | instructed you.”\nPaul glanced at her, caught a cold smile on her lips.\nGurney Halleck leaned between them, said: “l remind you, m’Lord, that there’s a Harkonnen in that bunch.” He nodded toward the dark-haired Feyd- Rautha pressed against a barrier lance on the left. “The one with the squinting eyes there on the left. As evil a face as | ever say. You promised me once that\n“Thank you, Gurney,” Paul said.\n“It’s the na-Baron...Baron now that the old man’s dead,” Gurney said. “He’ll do for what I’ve in—”\n“Can you take him, Gurney?”\n“M’Lord jests!”\n“That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough, don’t you think, Mother?”\nShe nodded. “Indeed.”\nPaul raised his voice, called out to the Emperor: “Majesty, is there a Harkonnen among you?”\nRoyal disdain revealed itself in the way the Emperor turned to look at Paul. “I believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal word,” he said.\n“My question was for information only,” Paul said. “I wish to know if a Harkonnen is officially a part of your entourage or if a Harkonnen is merely hiding behind a technicality out of cowardice.”\nThe Emperor’s smile was calculating. “Anyone accepted into the Imperial company is a member of my entourage.”\n“You have the word of a Duke,” Paul said, “but Muad’Dib is another matter. He may not recognize your definition of what constitutes an entourage. My friend Gurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen. If he—”\n“Kanly!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. He pressed against the barrier lance. “Your father named this vendetta, Atreides. You call me coward while you hide among your women and offer to send a lackey against me!”\nThe old Truthsayer whispered something fiercely into the Emperor’s ear, but he pushed her aside, said: “Kanly, is it? There are strict rules for kanly.”\n“Paul, put a stop to this,” Jessica said.\n“M’Lord,” Gurney said, “you promised me my day against the Harkonnens.”\n“You’ve had your day against them,” Paul said and he felt a harlequin abandon take over his emotions. He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders, handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife, began unstrapping his stillsuit. He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment.\n“There’s no need for this,” Jessica said. “There are easier ways, Paul.”\nPaul stepped out of his stillsuit, slipped the crysknife from its sheath in his mother’s hand. “l know,” he said. “Poison, an assassin, all the old familiar ways.”\n“You promised me a Harkonnen!” Gurney hissed, and Paul marked the rage in the man’s face, the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridged. “You owe it to me, m’Lord!”\n“Have you suffered more from them than I?” Paul asked.\n“My sister,” Gurney rasped. “My years in the slave pits—”\n“My father,” Paul said. “My good friends and companions, Thufir Hawat and Duncan Idaho, my years as a fugitive without rank or succor...and one more thing: it is now kanly and you know as well as | the rules that must prevail.”\nHalleck’s shoulders sagged. “M’Lord, if that swine...he’s no more than a beast you’d spurn with your foot and discard the shoe because it’d been contaminated. Call in an executioner, if you must, or let me do it, but don’t offer yourself to—”\n“Muad’Dib need not do this thing,” Chani said.\nHe glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes. “But the Duke Paul must,” he said.\n“This ts a Harkonnen animal!” Gurney rasped. Paul hesitated on the point of revealing his own Harkonnen ancestry, stopped at a sharp look from his mother, said merely: “But this being has human\nShape, Gurney, and deserves human doubt.”\nGurney said: “If he so much as—”\n“Please stand aside,” Paul said. He hefted the crysknife, pushed Gurney gently aside.\n“Gurney!” Jessica said. She touched Gurney’s arm. “He’s like his grandfather in this mood. Don’t distract him. It’s the only thing you can do for him now.” And she thought: Great Mother! What irony.\nThe Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha, seeing the heavy shoulders, the thick muscles. He turned to look at Paul—a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as\ndesiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin.\nJessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: “One thing, Son. Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit, a word implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods. The word-sound most frequently used is Uroshnor. If this one’s been prepared, as | strongly suspect, that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid and—”\n“I want no special advantage for this one,” Paul said. “Step back out of my way.”\nGurney spoke to her: “Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds his reason?”\nJessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why Paul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_35ce02bc54b8afffc3f2b50dc72587b50e6d548c5214f596edb406df057224bb_v2"}
