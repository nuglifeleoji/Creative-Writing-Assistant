Its supreme commandment is considered to be: “Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.”\nORNITHOPTER (commonly: ‘thopter): any aircraft capable of sustained wing-beat flight in the manner\nof birds.\nOUT-FREYN: Galach for “immediately foreign,” that is: not of your immediate community, not of the select.\nP\nPALM LOCK: any lock or seal which may be opened on contact with the palm of the human hand to which it has been keyed.\nPAN: on Arrakis, any low-lying region or depression created by the subsiding of the underlying basement complex. (On planets with sufficient water, a pan indicates a region once covered by open water. Arrakis is believed to have at least one such area, although this remains open to argument.)\nPANOPLIA PROPHETICUS: term covering the infectious superstitions used by the Bene Gesserit to exploit primitive regions. (See Missionaria Protectiva.)\nPARACOMPASS: any compass that determines direction by local magnetic anomaly; used where relevant charts are available and where a planet’s total magnetic field is unstable or subject to masking by severe magnetic storms.\nPENTASHIELD: a five-layer shield-generator field suitable for small areas such as doorways or passages (large reinforcing shields become increasingly unstable with each successive layer) and virtually impassable to anyone not wearing a\ndissembler tuned to the shield codes. (See Prudence Door.)\nPLASTEEL: steel which has been stabilized with stravidium fibers grown into its crystal structure. PLENISCENTA: an exotic green bloom of Ecaz noted\nfor its sweet aroma.\nPOLING THE SAND: the art of placing plastic and fiber poles in the open desert wastes of Arrakis and reading the patterns etched on the poles by Sandstorms as a clue to weather prediction.\nPORITRIN: third planet of Epsilon Alangue, considered by many Zensunni Wanderers as their planet of origin, although clues in their language and mythology show far more ancient planetary roots.\nPORTYGULS: oranges.\nPRANA (Prana-musculature): the body’s muscles when considered as units for ultimate training. (See Bindu.)\nPRE-SPICE MASS: the stage of fungusoid wild growth achieved when water is flooded into the excretions of Little Makers. At this stage, the spice of Arrakis forms a characteristic “blow,” exchanging the material from deep underground for the matter on the surface above it. This mass, after exposure to sun and air, becomes melange. (See also Melange and Water of Life.)\nPROCES VERBAL: a semiformal report alleging a crime against the Imperium. Legally: an action falling between a loose verbal allegation and a formal charge of crime.\nPROCTOR SUPERIOR: a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who is also regional director of a B.G. school. (Commonly: Bene Gesserit with the Sight.)\nPRUDENCE DOOR or PRUDENCE BARRIER (idiomatically: pru-door or pru-barrier): any pentashield situated for the escape of selected persons under conditions of pursuit. (See Pentashield.)\nPUNDI RICE: a mutated rice whose grains, high in natural sugar, achieve lengths up to four centimeters; chief export of Caladan.\nPYONS: planet-bound peasants or laborers, one of the base classes under the Faufreluches.

Withdrawal of the antidote at any time brings death.\nREVEREND MOTHER: originally, a proctor of the Bene Gesserit, one who has transformed an “illuminating poison” within her body, raising herself to a higher state of awareness. Title adopted by Fremen for their own religious leaders who accomplished a similar “illumination.” (See also Bene Gesserit and Water of Life.)\nRICHESE: fourth planet of Eridani A, classed with Ix as supreme in machine culture. Noted for miniaturization. (For a detailed study on how Richese and Ix escaped the more severe effects of the Butlerian Jihad, see The Last Jihad by Sumer and Kautman.)\nRIMWALL: second upper step of the protecting bluffs on the Shield Wall of Arrakis. (See Shield Wall.)\nRUH-SPIRIT: in Fremen belief, that part of the individual which is always rooted in (and capable of sensing) the metaphysical world. (See Alam al- Mithal.)\nS\nSADUS: judges. The Fremen title refers to holy judges, equivalent to saints.\nSALUSA SECUNDUS: third planet of Gamma Waiping; designated Imperial Prison Planet after removal of the Royal Court to Kaitain.

(See Tidal Dust Basin.)\nSANDWALKER: any Fremen trained to survive in the open desert.\nSANDWORM: see Shai-hulud.\nSAPHO: high-energy liquid extracted from barrier roots of Ecaz. Commonly used by Mentats who claim it amplifies mental powers. Users develop deep ruby stains on mouth and lips.\nSARDAUKAR: the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah Emperor. They were men from an environmental\nbackground of such ferocity that it killed six out of thirteen persons before the age of eleven. Their military training emphasized ruthlessness and a near-suicidal disregard for personal safety. They were taught from infancy to use cruelty as a standard weapon, weakening opponents with terror. At the apex of their sway over the affairs of the Universe, their swordsmanship was said to match that of the Ginaz tenth level and their cunning abilities at in-fighting were reputed to approach those of a Bene Gesserit adept. Any one of them was rated a match for any ten ordinary Landsraad military conscripts. By the time of Shaddam IV, while they were still formidable, their strength had been sapped by overconfidence, and the sustaining mystique of their warrior religion had been deeply undermined by cynicism.\nSARFA: the act of turning away from God. SAYYADINA: feminine acolyte in the Fremen religious hierarchy.\nSCHLAG: animal native to Tupile once hunted almost to extinction for its thin, tough hide.\nSECOND MOON: the smaller of the two satellites of\nArrakis, noteworthy for the kangaroo mouse figure in its surface markings.\nSELAMLIK: Imperial audience chamber.\nSEMUTA: the second narcotic derivative (by crystal extraction) from burned residue of elacca wood.

Sandworms grow to enormous size (specimens longer than 400 meters have been seen in the deep desert) and live to great age unless slain by one of their fellows or drowned in water, which is poisonous to them. Most of the sand on Arrakis is credited to sandworm action. (See Little Maker.)\nSHAITAN: Satan.\nSHARI-A: that part of the panoplia propheticus which sets forth the superstitious ritual. (See Missionaria Protectiva.)\nSHIELD, DEFENSIVE: the protective field produced by a Holtzman generator. This field derives from Phase One of the suspensor-nullification effect. A shield will permit entry only to objects moving at slow speeds (depending on setting, this speed ranges from six to nine centimeters per second) and can be shorted out only by a shire-sized electric field. (See Lasgun.)\nSHIELD WALL: a mountainous geographic feature in the northern reaches of Arrakis which protects a\nsmall area from the full force of the planet’s coriolis storms.\nSHIGAWIRE: metallic extrusion of a ground vine (Narvi narviium) grown only on Salusa Secundus and Ill Delta Kaising. It is noted for extreme tensile strength.\nSIETCH: Fremen: “Place of assembly in time of danger.” Because the Fremen lived so long in peril, the term came by general usage to designate any cave warren inhabited by one of their tribal communities.\nSIHAYA: Fremen: the desert springtime with religious overtones implying the time of fruitfulness and “the paradise to come.”\nSINK: a habitable lowland area on Arrakis surrounded by high ground that protects it from the prevailing storms.\nSINKCHART: map of the Arrakis surface laid out with reference to the most reliable paracompass routes between places of refuge. (See Paracompass.)\nSIRAT: the passage in the O.C.

Ixian solido projectors are commonly considered the best.\nSONDAGI: the fern tulip of Tupali.\nSOO-SOO SOOK!: water-seller\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e56d36e6206f7b29e8ba72cb7334ad8b8fde673018ee99b38134c4731540e471_v2"}
