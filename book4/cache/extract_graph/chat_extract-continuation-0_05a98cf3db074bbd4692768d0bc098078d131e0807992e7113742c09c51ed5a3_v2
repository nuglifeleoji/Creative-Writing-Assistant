象爱妹妹、爱姐姐、爱母亲一样热爱你。原谅我吧……那天，他象“受戒”一样熬过了这一个中午。中午一过，他和大家又一块开始锄地。锄了一会儿地后，他突然感觉到自己是多么地愚蠢和不近人情！是啊，简直是一个真正的土包子老百姓！他为什么用这样一种可笑的方式来折磨那个可爱的人呢？他难道就不能回去，那怕三言两语给她说明他的意思不就行了？亲爱的人给他捎话让他到城里来，他可以用“忙”来推托，现在她为了他，亲自跑回来，找到他门上，他却象一个贼娃子一样躲在这山里，不见人家……他立刻对锄地的人说：“你们先锄，我回去有个事！”于是掂起锄头就大撒腿往回跑…… \n　　等他跑回家里，母亲告诉他，润叶已经坐汽车回县城去了！ \n　　他已经听不见母亲对他的抱怨声，一个人出了门，来到通往县城的公路上，心如火焚地走了一段路，嘴里喃喃地说：“对不起你，润叶，我对不起你……” \n　　从这以后，他想他不仅拒绝了润叶对他的爱情，也割断了他和她过去的友情。他太伤她的心了，她也许再也不会理他了！ \n　　他于是就闷着头干活，一天也没多少话。不论是队里还是家里，他把该说的说完，便没有一句多余话了。山里有人和他开个玩笑，他也会表现出一种厌恶的情绪，弄得人家很尴尬。大家都觉得他成了个“怪”人；谁也猜不透这位年轻的队长究竟碰到了什么事……这天中午他吃完饭，就一声不响地挑了水桶，又去了自留地浇那几畦蔬菜。自入伏以来，天一直没下雨——其实伏前的几个月里也没下过一次饱墒雨。 \n　　他挑着空水桶，向村外走去。天热得要命，好象划一棍火柴就能把空气点着。远远近近的山头上，庄稼的绿色已不再鲜艳，一片灰塌塌的。川道里的庄稼稍好一些，因为曾经用抽水机浇过一次。现在，东拉河细得象一根麻绳，已经拦不住多少水了。如果天再不下雨，今年又将是一个年馑。火辣辣的太阳晒焦了土地，也晒焦了庄稼人的心！ \n　　少安家的自留地在去米家镇方向的公路上面，出村子走不远就到了。自留地有一点川台地，其余都是坡洼地。那几畦蔬菜和红薯、南瓜都在川台地上。坡洼地上种的都是庄稼。 \n　　少安来到自留地下面的东拉河里，拦起一点水，马勺刚能舀起。他舀了一担泥糊水，往公路上面的地里担。 \n　　从河道上了公路，再从公路上到地里，几乎得爬蜓半架山。家里没什么硬正吃的，只喝了几碗稀饭，每往上担一回水，他几乎都是在拼命挣扎。天\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>润叶<|>PERSON<|>润叶 is a character
