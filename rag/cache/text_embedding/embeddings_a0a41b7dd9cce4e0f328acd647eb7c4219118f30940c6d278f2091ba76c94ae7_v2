{"input": [" not Stilgar’s way,” she said, and thought: Unless the twins put him up to it. But that didn’t feel right either. She wondered at herself: no sensations of panic to suppress, and her fears for the twins were tempered by what Ghanima had revealed. She peered up at al-Fali, found him studying\nher with pity in his eyes. She said: “They’ve gone into the desert by themselves.”\n“Alone? Those two children!”\nShe did not bother to explain that “those two children” probably knew more about desert survival than most living Fremen. Her thoughts were fixed, instead, on Leto’s odd behavior when he’d insisted that she allow herself to be abducted. She’d put the memory aside, but this moment demanded it. He’d said she would know the moment to obey him.\n“The messenger should be in the sietch by now,” al-Fali said. “I will bring him to you.” He let himself out through the patched curtain.\nJessica stared at the curtain. It was red cloth of spice- fiber, but the patches were blue. The story was that this sietch had refused to profit from Muad’Dib’s religion, earning the enmity of Alia’s Priesthood. The people here reportedly had put their capital into a scheme to raise dogs as large as ponies, dogs bred for intelligence as guardians of children. The dogs had all died. Some said it was poison and the Priests were blamed.\nShe shook her head to drive out these reflections, recognizing them for what they were: ghafla, the gadfly distraction.\nWhere had those children gone? To Jacurutu? They had a plan. They tried to enlighten me to the extent they thought l’d accept, she remembered. And when they’d reached the limits as they saw them, Leto had commanded her to obey.\nHe’d commanded her!\nLeto had recognized what Alia was doing; that much was obvious. Both twins had spoken of their aunt’s “affliction,” even when defending her. Alia was gambling on the rightness of her position in the Regency. Demanding custody of the twins confirmed that. Jessica found a harsh laugh Shaking her own breast. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam had been fond of explaining this particular error to\nher student, Jessica. “/f you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness, then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you. This is a common error. Even I, your teacher, have made it.”\n“And even I, your student, have made it,” Jessica whispered to herself.\nShe heard fabrics whispering in the passage beyond the curtain. Two young Fremen entered, part of the entourage they’d picked up during the night. The two were obviously awed at being in the presence of Muad’Dib’s mother. Jessica had read them completely: they were non-thinkers, attaching themselves to any fancied power for the identity which this gave them. Without a reflection from her they were empty. Thus, they were dangerous.\n“We were sent ahead by al-Fali to prepare you,” one of the young Fremen said.\nJessica felt an abrupt clenching tightness in her breast, but her voice remained calm. “Prepare me for what?”\n“Stilgar has sent Duncan Idaho as his messenger.”\nJessica pulled her aba hood up over her hair, an unconscious gesture. Duncan? But he was Alia’s tool.\nThe Fremen who'd spoken took a half step forward. “Idaho says he has come to take you to safety, but al-Fali does not see how this can be.”\n“It seems passing strange, indeed,” Jessica said. “But there are stranger things in our universe. Bring him.”\nThey glanced at each other but obeyed, leaving together with such a rush that they tore another rent in the worn curtain.\nPresently Idaho stepped through the curtain, followed by the two Fremen and al-Fali bringing up the rear, hand on his crysknife. Idaho appeared composed. He wore the dress casuals of an Atreides House Guard, a uniform which had changed little in more than fourteen centuries. Arrakis had replaced the old gold-handled plasteel blade with a crysknife, but that was minor.\n“I’m told you wish to help me,” Jessica said.\n“As odd as that may seem,” he said.\n“But didn’t Alia send you to abduct me?” she asked.\nA slight raising of his black eyebrows was the only mark of surprise. The many-faceted Tleilaxu eyes continued to stare at her with glittering intensity. “Those were her orders,” he said.\nAl-Fali’s knuckles went white on his crysknife, but he did not draw.\n“I’ve spent much of this night reviewing the mistakes | made with my daughter,” she said.\n“There were many,” Idaho agreed, “and | shared in most of them.”\nShe saw now that his jaw muscles were trembling.\n“It was easy to listen to the arguments which led us astray,” Jessica said. “I wanted to leave this place... You... you wanted a girl you saw as a younger version of me.”\nHe accepted this silently.\n“Where are my grandchildren?” she demanded, voice going harsh.\nHe blinked. Then: “Stilgar believes they have gone into the desert—hiding. Perhaps they saw this crisis coming.”\nJessica glanced at al-Fali, who nodded his recognition that she had anticipated this.\n“What is Alia doing?” Jessica asked.\n“She risks civil war,” he said.\n“Do you believe it'll come to that?”\nIdaho shrugged. “Probably not. These are softer times. There are more people willing to listen to pleasant arguments.”\n“I agree,” she said. “Well and good, what of my grandchildren?”\n“Stilgar will find them—if.. .”\n“Yes, | see.” It was really up to Gurney Halleck then. She turned to look at the rock wall on her left. “Alia grasps the\npower firmly now.” She looked back at Idaho. “You understand? One uses power by grasping it lightly. To grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power, and thus to become its victim.”\n“As my Duke always told me,” Idaho said.\nSomehow Jessica knew he meant the older Leto, not Paul. She asked: “Where am | to be taken in this. . . abduction?”\nIdaho peered down at her as though trying to see into the shadows created by the hood.\nAl-Fali stepped forward: “My Lady, you are not seriously thinking...”\n“Is it not my right to decide my own fate?” Jessica asked.\n“But this . . .” Al-Fali’s head nodded toward Idaho.\n“This was my loyal guardian before Alia was born,” Jessica said. “Before he died saving my son’s life and mine. We Atreides always honor certain obligations.”\n“Then you will go with me?” Idaho asked.\n“Where would you take her?” al-Fali asked.\n“Best that you don’t know,” Jessica said.\nAl-Fali scowled but remained silent. His face betrayed indecision, an understanding of the wisdom in her words but an unresolved doubt of Idaho’s trustworthiness.\n“What of the Fedaykin who helped me?” Jessica asked.\n“They have Stilgar’s countenance if they can get to Tabr,” Idaho said. Jessica faced al-Fali: “I command you to go there, my friend. Stilgar can use Fedaykin in the search for my grandchildren.”\nThe old Naib lowered his gaze. “As Muad’Dib’s mother commands.”\nHe’s still obeying Paul, she thought.\n“We should be out of here quickly,” Idaho said. “The search is certain to include this place, and that early.”\nJessica rocked forward and arose with that fluid grace which never quite left the Bene Gesserit, even when they felt the pangs of age. And she felt old now after her night of flight. Even as she moved, her mind remained on that\npeculiar interview with her grandson. What was he really doing? She shook her head, covered the motion by adjusting her hood. It was too easy to fall into the trap of underestimating Leto. Life with ordinary children conditioned one to a false view of the inheritance which the twins enjoyed.\nHer attention was caught by Idaho’s pose. He stood in the relaxed preparedness for violence, one foot ahead of the other, a stance which she herself had taught him. She shot a quick look at the two young Fremen, at al-Fali. Doubts still assailed the old Fremen Naib and the two young men felt this.\n“I trust this man with my life,” she said, addressing herself to al-Fali. “And it is not the first time.”\n“My Lady,” al-Fali protested. “It’s just...” He glared at Idaho. “He’s the husband of the Coan-Teen!”\n“And he was trained by my Duke and by me,” she said.\n“But he’s a ghola!” The words were torn from al-Fali.\n“My son’s ghola,” she reminded him.\nIt was too much for a former Fedaykin who'd once pledged himself to support Muad’Dib to the death. He sighed, stepped aside, and motioned the two young men to open the curtains.\nJessica stepped through, Idaho behind her. She turned, spoke to al-Fali in the doorway. “You are to go to Stilgar. He’s to be trusted.”\n“Yes...” But she still heard doubts in the old man’s voice.\nIdaho touched her arm. “We should go at once. Is there anything you wish to take?”\n“Only my common sense,” she said.\n“Why? Do you fear you’re making a mistake?”\nShe glanced up at him. “You were always the best ‘thopter pilot in our service, Duncan.”\nThis did not amuse him. He stepped ahead of her, moving swiftly, retracing the way he’d come. Al-Fali fell into step\nbeside Jessica. “How did you know he came by ’thopter?”\n“He wears no stillSuit,” Jessica said.\nAl-Fali appeared abashed by this obvious perception. He would not be silenced, though. “Our messenger brought him here directly from Stilgar’s. They could’ve been seen.”\n“Were you seen, Duncan?” Jessica asked Idaho’s back.\n“You know better than that,” he said. “We flew lower than the dunetops.”\nThey turned into a side passage which led downward in Spiral steps, debouching finally into an open chamber well- lighted by glowglobes high in the brown rock. A single ornithopter sat facing the far wall, crouched there like an insect waiting to spring. The wall would be false rock, then— a door opening onto the desert. As poor as this sietch was, it still maintained the instruments of secrecy and mobility.\nIdaho opened the ornithopter’s door for her, helped her into the right-hand seat. As she moved past him, she saw perspiration on his forehead where a lock of the black goat- hair lay tumbled. Unbidden, Jessica found herself recalling that head spouting blood in a noisy cavern. The steely marbles of the Tleilaxu eyes brought her out of that recollection. Nothing was as it seemed anymore. She busied herself fastening her seatbelt.\n“It’s been a long time since you've flown me, Duncan,” she said.\n“Long and far time,” he said. He was already checking the controls.\nAl-Fali and the two younger Fremen waited beside the controls to the false rock, prepared to open it.\n“Do you think | harbor doubts about you?” Jessica asked, speaking softly to Idaho.\nIdaho kept his attention on an engine instrument, ignited the impellers and watched a needle move. A smile touched his mouth, a quick and", "ithopter’s door for her, helped her into the right-hand seat. As she moved past him, she saw perspiration on his forehead where a lock of the black goat- hair lay tumbled. Unbidden, Jessica found herself recalling that head spouting blood in a noisy cavern.

A smile touched his mouth, a quick and harsh gesture in his sharp features, gone as quickly as it had come.\n“I am still Atreides,” Jessica said. “Alia is not.”\n“Have no fear,” he grated. “I still serve the Atreides.”\n“Alia is no longer Atreides,” Jessica repeated.\n“You needn’t remind me!” he snarled. “Now shut up and let me fly this thing.”\nThe desperation in his voice was quite unexpected, out of keeping with the Idaho she’d known. Putting down a renewed sense of fear, Jessica asked: “Where are we going, Duncan? You can tell me now.”\nBut he nodded to al-Fali and the false rock opened outward into bright silvery sunlight. The ornithopter leaped outward and up, its wings throbbing with the effort, the jets roaring, and they mounted into an empty sky. Idaho set a southwesterly course toward Sahaya Ridge which could be seen as a dark line upon the sand.\nPresently he said: “Do not think harshly of me, My Lady.”\n“I haven’t thought harshly of you since that night you came into our Arrakeen great hall roaring drunk on spice- beer,” she said. But his words renewed her doubts, and she fell into the relaxed preparedness of complete prana-bindu defense.\n“|I remember that night well,” he said. “I was very young... inexperienced.”\n“But the best swordmaster in my Duke’s retinue.”\n“Not quite, My Lady. Gurney could best me six times out of ten.” He glanced at her. “Where is Gurney?”\n“Doing my bidding.”\nHe shook his head.\n“Do you know where we’re going?” she asked.\n“Yes, My Lady.”\n“Then tell me.”\n“Very well. | promised that | would create a believable plot against House Atreides. Only one way, really, to do that.” He pressed a button on the control wheel and cocoon restraints whipped from Jessica’s seat, enfolded her in unbreakable softness, leaving only her head exposed. “I’m taking you to Salusa Secundus,” he said. “To Farad’n.”\nIn a rare, uncontrolled spasm, Jessica surged against the restraints, felt them tighten, easing only when she relaxed, but not before she felt the deadly shigawire concealed in the protective sheathing.\n“The shigawire release has been disconnected,” he said, not looking at her. “Oh yes, and don’t try Voice on me. I’ve come a long way since the days when you could move me that way.” He looked at her. “The Tleilaxu armored me against such wiles.”\n“You're obeying Alia,” Jessica said, “and she—”\n“Not Alia,” he said. “We do The Preacher’s bidding. He wants you to teach Farad’n as once you taught... Paul.”\nJessica remained in frozen silence, remembering Leto’s words, that she would find an interesting student. Presently she said: “This Preacher—is he my son?”\nIdaho’s voice seemed to come from a great distance: “l wish | knew.”\nThe universe is just there; that’s the only way a Fedaykin can view it and remain the master of his senses. The universe neither threatens nor promises. It holds things beyond our sway: the fall of a meteor, the eruption of a spiceblow, growing old and dying. These are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you fee/ about them. You cannot fend off such realities with words. They will come at you in their own wordless way and then, then you will understand what is meant by “life and death.” Understanding this, you will be filled with joy.\n—MUAD'DIB TO HIS FEDAYKIN\n“A nd those are the things we have set in motion,” Wensicia said. “These things were done for you.”\nFarad’n remained motionless, seated across from his mother in her morning room. The sun’s golden light came from behind him, casting his shadow on the white-carpeted floor. Light reflected from the wall behind his mother drew a nimbus around her hair. She wore her usual white robe trimmed in gold—reminders of royal days. Her heart-shaped face appeared composed, but he knew she was watching his every reaction. His stomach felt empty, although he’d just come from breakfast.\n“You don’t approve?” Wensicia asked.\n“What is there to disapprove?” he asked.\n“Well... that we kept this from you until now?”\n“Oh, that.” He studied his mother, tried to reflect upon his complex position in this matter. He could only think ona thing he had noticed recently, that Tyekanik no longer called her “My Princess.” What did he call her? Queen Mother?\nWhy do I feel a sense of loss? he wondered. What am I losing? The answer was obvious: he was losing his carefree days, time for those pursuits of the mind which so attracted him. If this plot unfolded by his mother came off, those\nthings would be gone forever. New responsibilities would demand his attention. He found that he resented this deeply. How dared they take such liberties with his time? And without even consulting him!\n“Out with it,” his mother said. “Something’s wrong.”\n“What if this plan fails?” he asked, saying the first thing that came into his mind.\n“How can it fail?”\n“I don’t know. ... Any plan can fail. How’re you using Idaho in all of this?”\n“Idaho? What’s this interest in... Oh, yes—that mystic fellow Tyek brought here without consulting me. That was wrong of him. The mystic spoke of Idaho, didn’t he?”\nIt was a clumsy lie on her part, and Farad’n found himself staring at his mother in wonderment. She’d known about The Preacher all along!\n“It’s just that I’ve never seen a ghola,” he said.\nShe accepted this, said: “We're saving Idaho for something important.”\nFarad’n chewed silently at his upper lip.\nWensicia found herself reminded of his dead father. Dalak had been like that at times, very inward and complex, difficult to read. Dalak, she reminded herself, had been related to Count Hasimir Fenring, and there’d been something of the dandy and the fanatic in both of them. Would Farad’n follow in that path? She began to regret having Tyek lead the lad into the Arrakeen religion. Who knew where that might take him?\n“What does Tyek call you now?” Farad’n asked.\n“What’s that?” She was startled by this shift.\n“I’ve noticed that he doesn’t call you ‘My Princess’ anymore.”\nHow observant he is, she thought, wondering why this filled her with disquiet. Does he think I’ve taken Tyek as a lover? Nonsense, it wouldn’t matter one way or the other. Then why this question?\n“He calls me ‘My Lady,’” she said.\n“Why?”\n“Because that’s the custom in all of the Great Houses.”\nIncluding the Atreides, he thought.\n“It’s less suggestive if overheard,” she explained. “Some will think we’ve given up our legitimate aspirations.”\n“Who would be that stupid?” he asked.\nShe pursed her lips, decided to let it pass. A small thing, but great campaigns were made up of many small things.\n“The Lady Jessica shouldn’t have left Caladan,” he said.\nShe shook her head sharply. What was this? His mind was darting around like a crazy thing! She said: “What do you mean?”\n“She shouldn’t have gone back to Arrakis,” he said. “That’s bad strategy. Makes one wonder. Would’ve been better to have her grandchildren visit her on Caladan.”\nHe’s right, she thought, dismayed that this had never occurred to her. Tyek would have to explore this immediately. Again she shook her head. No! What was Farad’n doing? He must know that the Priesthood would never risk both twins in space.\nShe said this.\n“Is it the Priesthood or the Lady Alia?” he asked, noting that her thoughts had gone where he had wanted. He found exhilaration in his new importance, the mind-games available in political plotting. It had been a long time since his mother’s mind had interested him. She was too easily maneuvered.\n“You think Alia wants power for herself?” Wensicia asked.\nHe looked away from her. Of course Alia wanted the power for herself! All of the reports from that accursed planet agreed on this. His thoughts took off on a new course.\n“I’ve been reading about their Planetologist,” he said. “There has to be a clue to the sandworms and the haploids in there somewhere, if only... .”\n“Leave that to others now!” she said, beginning to lose patience with him. “Is this all you have to say about the things we’ve done for you?”\n“You didn’t do them for me,” he said.\n“Wha-a-at?”\n“You did it for House Corrino,” he said, “and you’re House Corrino right now. I’ve not been invested.”\n“You have responsibilities!” she said. “What about all of the people who depend upon you?”\nAs if her words put the burden upon him, he felt the weight of all those hopes and dreams which followed House Corrino.\n“Yes,” he said, “I understand about them, but | find some of the things done in my name distasteful.”\n“Dis ... How can you say such a thing? We do what any Great House would do in promoting its own fortunes!”\n“Do you? | think you’ve been a bit gross. No! Don’t interrupt me. If I’m to be an Emperor, then you'd better learn how to listen to me. Do you think I cannot read between the lines? How were those tigers trained?”\nShe remained speechless at this cutting demonstration of his perceptive abilities.\n“I see,” he said. “Well, l'II keep Tyek because | know you led him into this. He’s a good officer under most circumstances, but he'll fight for his own principles only ina friendly arena.”\n“His... principles?”\n“The difference between a good officer and a poor one is strength of character and about five heartbeats,” he said. “He has to stick by his principles wherever they’re challenged.”\n“The tigers were necessary,” she said.\n“PIL believe that if they succeed,” he said. “But I will not condone what had to be done in training them. Don’t protest. It’s obvious. They were conditioned. You said it yourself.”\n“What're you going to do?” she asked.\n“I’m going to wait and see,” he said. “Perhaps l'Il become Emperor.”\nShe put a hand to her breast, sighed. For a few moments there", " speechless at this cutting demonstration of his perceptive abilities.\n“I see,” he said. “Well, l'II keep Tyek because | know you led him into this.

For a few moments there he’d terrified her. She’d almost believed he would denounce her. Principles! But he was committed now; she could see that.\nFarad’n got up, went to the door and rang for his mother’s attendants. He looked back: “We are through, aren’t we?”\n“Yes.” She raised a hand as he started to leave. “Where’re you going?”\n“To the library. I’ve become fascinated lately by Corrino history.” He left her then, sensing how he carried his new commitment with him.\nDamn her!\nBut he knew he was committed. And he recognized that there was a deep emotional difference between history as recorded on shigawire and read at leisure, a deep difference between that kind of history and the history which one lived. This new living history which he felt gathering around him possessed a sense of plunging into an irreversible future. Farad’n could feel himself driven now by the desires of all those whose fortunes rode with him. He found it strange that he could not pin down his own desires in this.\nIt is said of Muad’Dib that once when he saw a weed trying to grow between two rocks, he moved one of the rocks. Later, when the weed was seen to be flourishing, he covered it with the remaining rock. “That was its fate,” he explained.\n—THE COMMENTARIES\nll N ow!” Ghanima shouted.\nLeto, two steps ahead of her in reaching the narrow cut in the rocks, did not hesitate. He dove into the slit, crawled forward until darkness enfolded him. He heard Ghanima drop behind him, a sudden stillness, and her voice, not hurrying or fearful:\n“I'm stuck.”\nHe stood up, knowing this would bring his head within reach of questing claws, reversed himself in the narrow passage, crept back until he felt Ghanima’s outstretched hand.\n“It’s my robe,” she said. “It’s caught.”\nHe heard rocks falling directly below them, pulled on her hand but felt only a small gain.\nThere was panting below them, a growl.\nLeto tensed himself, wedging his hips against the rock, heaved on Ghanima’s arm. Cloth ripped and he felt her jerk toward him. She hissed and he knew she felt pain, but he pulled once more, harder. She came farther into the hole, then all the way, dropping beside him. They were too close to the end of the cut, though. He turned, dropped to all fours, scrambled deeper. Ghanima pulled herself along behind him. There was a panting intensity to her movements which told him she’d been hurt. He came to the end of the opening, rolled over and peered upward out the\nnarrow gap of their sanctuary. The opening was about two meters above him, filled with stars. Something large obscured the stars.\nA rumbling growl filled the air around the twins. It was deep, menacing, an ancient sound: hunter speaking to its prey.\n“How badly are you hurt?” Leto asked, keeping his voice even.\nShe matched him, tone for tone: “One of them clawed me. Breached my stillsuit along the left leg. I’m bleeding.”\n“How bad?”\n“Vein. | can stop it.”\n“Use pressure,” he said. “Don’t move. l'Il take care of our friends.”\n“Careful,” she said. “They’re bigger than | expected.” Leto unsheathed his crysknife, reached up with it. He knew the tiger would be questing downward, claws raking\nthe narrow passage where its body could not go.\nSlowly, slowly, he extended the knife. Abruptly something struck the top of the blade. He felt the blow all along his arm, almost lost his grip on the knife. Blood gushed along his hand, spattered his face, and there came an immediate scream which deafened him. The stars became visible. Something threshed and flung itself down the rocks toward the sand in a violent caterwauling.\nOnce more, the stars were obscured and he heard the hunter’s growl. The second tiger had moved into place, unmindful of its companion’s fate.\n“They're persistent,” Leto said.\n“You got one for sure,” Ghanima said. “Listen!”\nThe screams and thrashing convulsions below them were growing fainter. The second tiger remained, though, a curtain against the stars.\nLeto sheathed his blade, touched Ghanima’s arm. “Give me your knife. | want a fresh tip to make sure of this one.”\n“Do you think they’ll have a third one in reserve?” She asked.\n“Not likely. Laza tigers hunt in pairs.”\n“Just as we do,” she said.\n“As we do,” he agreed. He felt the handle of her crysknife Slip into his palm, gripped it tightly. Once more he began that careful upward questing. The blade encountered only empty air, even when he reached into a level dangerous to his body. He withdrew, pondering this.\n“Can't you find it?”\n“It’s not behaving the way the other one did.”\n“It’s still there. Smell it?”\nHe swallowed in a dry throat. A fetid breath, moist with the musky smell of the cat, assaulted his nostrils. The stars were still blocked from view. Nothing could be heard of the first cat; the crysknife’s poison had completed its work.\n“I think I’m going to have to stand up,” he said.\n“No!”\n“It has to be teased into reach of the knife.”\n“Yes, but we agreed that if one of us could avoid being wounded...”\n“And you're wounded, so you're the one going back,” he said.\n“But if you’re badly injured, | won’t be able to leave you,’ she said.\n“Do you have a better idea?”\n“Give me back my knife.”\n“But your leg!”\n“I can stand on the good one.”\n“That thing could take your head off with one sweep. Maybe the maula...”\n“If there’s anyone out there to hear, they'll know we came prepared for—”\n“| don’t like your taking this risk!” he said.\n“Whoever’s out there mustn’t learn we have maulas—not yet.” She touched his arm. “I'll be careful, keep my head\n,\ndown.”\nAs he remained silent, she said: “You know I’m the one who has to do this. Give me back my knife.”\nReluctantly he quested with his free hand, found her hand and returned the knife. It was the logical thing to do, but logic warred with every emotion in him.\nHe felt Ghanima pull away, heard the sandy rasping of her robe against the rock. She gasped, and he knew she must be standing. Be very careful! he thought. And he almost pulled her back to insist they use a maula pistol. But that could warn anyone out there that they had such weapons. Worse, it could drive the tiger out of reach, and they’d be trapped in here with a wounded tiger waiting for them in some unknown place out on those rocks.\nGhanima took a deep breath, braced her back against one wall of the cleft. / must be quick, she thought. She reached upward with the knife point. Her left leg throbbed where the claws had raked it. She felt the crusting of blood against her skin there and the warmth of a new flow. Very quick! She sank her senses into the calm preparation for crisis which the Bene Gesserit Way provided, put pain and all other distractions out of her awareness. The cat must reach down! Slowly she passed the blade along the opening. Where was the damned animal? Once more she raked the air. Nothing. The tiger would have to be lured into attack.\nCarefully she probed with her sense of smell. Warm breath came from her left. She poised herself, drew ina deep breath, screamed: “Taqwa!” It was the old Fremen battlecry, its meaning found in the most ancient legends: “The price of freedom!” With the cry she tipped the blade and stabbed along the cleft’s dark opening. Claws found her elbow before the knife touched flesh, and she had time only to tip her wrist toward the pain before agony raked her arm from elbow to wrist. Through the pain, she felt the poison tip sink into the tiger. The blade was wrenched from her numb fingers. But again the narrow gap of the cleft lay open to the\nstars and the wailing voice of a dying cat filled the night. They followed it by its death throes, a thrashing passage down the rocks. Presently the death-silence came.\n“It got my arm,” Ghanima said, trying to bind a loose fold of her robe around the wound.\n“Badly?”\n“I think so. | can’t feel my hand.”\n“Let me get a light and—”\n“Not until we get under cover!”\n“VIE hurry.”\nShe heard him twisting to reach his Fremkit, felt the dark Slickness of a nightshield as it was slipped over her head, tucked in behind her. He didn’t bother to make it moisture tight.\n“My knife’s on this side,” she said. “I can feel the handle with my knee.”\n“Leave it for now.”\nHe ignited a single small globe. The brilliance of it made her blink. Leto put the globe on the sandy floor at one side, gasped as he saw her arm. One claw had opened a long, gaping wound which twisted from the elbow along the back of her arm almost to the wrist. The wound described the way she had rotated her arm to present the knife tip to the tiger’s paw.\nGhanima glanced once at the wound, closed her eyes and began reciting the Litany Against Fear.\nLeto found himself sharing her need, but put aside the clamor of his own emotions while he set about binding up the wound. It had to be done carefully to stop the flow of blood while retaining the appearance of a clumsy job which Ghanima might have done by herself. He made her tie off the knot with her free hand, holding one end of the bandage in her teeth.\n“Now let’s look at the leg,” he said.\nShe twisted around to present the other wound. It was not as bad: two shallow claw cuts along the calf. They had bled\nfreely into the stillsuit, however. He cleaned it up as best he could, bound the wound beneath the stillsuit. He sealed the suit over the bandage.\n“I got sand in it,” he said. “Have it treated as soon as you get back.”\n“Sand in our wounds,” she said. “That’s an old story for Fremen.”\nHe managed a smile, sat back.\nGhanima took a deep breath. “We've pulled it off.”\n“Not yet.”\nShe swallowed, fighting to recover"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_a0a41b7dd9cce4e0f328acd647eb7c4219118f30940c6d278f2091ba76c94ae7_v2"}
