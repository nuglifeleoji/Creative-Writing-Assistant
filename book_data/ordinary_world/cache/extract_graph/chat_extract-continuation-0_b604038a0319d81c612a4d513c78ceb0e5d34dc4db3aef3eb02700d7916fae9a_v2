\n　　落后的西部地区，就象过去参观大寨那样，由各级领导带领，纷纷组团结队，到温暖的南方去取经，也捎带着游览了一些名胜古迹。 \n　　过去没啥名气的深圳成了中国新的耶路撒冷。 \n　　穿臃肿老式棉衣的西部人，参观游览一圈回来以后，有的羡慕惊讶那里的开放与发达；有的则摇头叹息，大发“国将不国”的哀叹，说东部地区完全成了“西方世界”……不管怎样，去那里转了一圈的西部各级领导，都受到了巨大的冲击，有些干部率先改革了自己的服装，穿起做工粗糙的西服，戴起鸭舌帽、变色镜，披上了米黄色风雨衣。当然，他们各自也或多或少取回了一些“经”。他们最为震惊的是，象江苏省某些乡镇企业的经济产值竟然超过北方某些地区的产值。看来，仅仅在农业经济上做文章显然远远不够了。必须大力发展乡镇企业。东部地区的口号成为新的经典在西部传播开来：无农不稳，无工不富，无商不活！ \n　　八三年开春以后，不管条件是否成熟，各地的乡镇企业就星罗棋布般发展起来。各种确有才能的人和一些冒险家纷纷申办起各种工厂和公司。挂着“总经理”、“董事长”等等头衔的名片满天飞，其中有些单位的全部人马就是“总经理”自己一个人——他们的“公司”就在腋下的皮包里装着。从总体而言，沉睡的西部打了一个哈欠，伸了一个懒腰，开始苏醒过来，似乎准备动一番干戈了。发展经济的热情急骤地高涨起来。 \n　　但是，在双水村这个普通的小山村里，作为先行者的孙少安，当全社会乡镇企业蓬勃兴起的时候，他的事业却象一只被巨浪打碎的小船抛在岸边，失去了继续前行的能力。 \n　　砖场倒闭至现在，已经有半年的时光。孙少安的精神仍然没有从这场灾难中恢复过来。 \n　　这半年中，他又复原成一个地道的庄稼人，整天闷着头地里干活。村里和外面世界的事，他都漠不关心。那些事和他有什么相干哩？他现在欠一屁股帐债，处于水深火热之中，熬煎得吃不下饭，睡不着觉。 \n　　这时候，他也体验到类似孙少平的那种感觉：只有繁重的体力劳动，才使精神上的痛苦变为某种麻木，以至使思维局限在机械性活动中。他真没勇气去面对自己残破不堪的现实啊！砖场死气沉沉。日子死气沉沉。村里干过活的人，工钱还没给人家开完，而一万元贷款，利息已经\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
