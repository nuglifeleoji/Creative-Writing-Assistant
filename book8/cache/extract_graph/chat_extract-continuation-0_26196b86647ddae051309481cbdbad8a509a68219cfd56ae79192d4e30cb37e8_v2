蓝轩宇确实是有些贪玩儿，他这会儿正站在一个卖手办的店里，看着一个特别漂亮的手办，小脸上满是渴望之色。\n\n    龙皇斗罗那个金色手办，开启了他对这种精致模型的大门。但妈妈那时候说，只能买一个。这些手办的价格都是相当不菲的。\n\n    此时他看上的另一个手办，是银色涂装的，巨大的翅膀在背后张开，一头银色长发在脑后飘扬，手持一柄银白色长枪，紫色眼眸，略微卡通的开脸。一身银色铠甲。\n\n    “小朋友，你喜欢这个吗？”售货员早就看到他站在那里了，今天卖场内人不算太多，她看蓝轩宇长得好看，也就凑了过来。\n\n    蓝轩宇点了点头，“阿姨，这个银龙斗罗能不能便宜？”上次他买龙皇斗罗手办的时候，就看到过这个，只是当时只能买一个，他就选了龙皇斗罗。那时南澄就告诉他说，这是一对的，银龙斗罗是龙皇斗罗的妻子。\n\n    售货员笑道：“这个可不行哦。这是第三十代的限量版，铠甲都是用稀有金属制作而成的，我们也没权利降价啊！”\n\n    “哦。”蓝轩宇略微撅了撅嘴，“谢谢阿姨。那我以后再来买。”\n\n    售货员看他样子可爱，笑道：“那你可要快点哦，这一批限量版剩余的很少了。我们店都只有这一个了。”\n\n    “啊？”蓝轩宇有些焦急，他真的很喜欢这个手办。\n\n    “这个手办我要了。”正在这时，一个悦耳的声音响起。\n\n    售货员赶忙站起身，看向来人，眼睛顿时一亮，“哇，您的假发是在哪里买的？和银龙斗罗的好像呢。”\n\n    蓝轩宇一听有人要买，再加上售货员说了只剩下一个，顿时心中大急，回过身来。\n\n    可当他看到来人时，不禁愣了愣。\n\n    银色长发，紫色眼眸，还有同样的黑色口罩。\n\n    “阿姨，是你呀。”\n\n    娜娜眼神柔和的看着他，蹲下身体，抬起手，略微犹豫了一下，但终究还是没能忍住，在他那粉嫩的面颊上摸了摸，“是啊！你很喜欢这个手办是不是？阿姨送给你。”\n\n    “啊？不行、不行。妈妈说了，不能随便要别人的东西。”蓝轩宇赶忙说道。\n\n    娜娜微微一笑，“我这不是摸了你的小脸吗？就算是报酬好了。”\n\n    蓝轩宇愣了愣，他对这种交换显然不太明白。再看看售货员已经将那个银龙斗罗手办拿了下来在包装了，顿时有些纠结起来。\n\n    看着他眉头微蹙的样子，娜娜忍不住抬手为他抚平了眉心，“皱眉不好看，你开心的时候最好看。”\n\n    “阿姨，我真的可以要�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
