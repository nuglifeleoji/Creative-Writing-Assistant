叶文洁看看波形显示．信息仍源源不断地从太空中涌进红岸天线．她打开另一个接口．启动了实时译解，接收到的信息被立刻显示出来。在以后的四个多小时中．叶文洁知道了三体世界的存在·知道了那个一次次浴火重生的文明．也知道了他们星际移民的企图。\n     凌晨四点多．来自半人马座的信息结束了，译解系统开始无结果地运行，不断发出失败信息．红岸监听系统所听到的．又是宇宙荒凉的噪声。\n     但叶文洁可以确定．刚才的一切不是梦。\n     太阳确实是一个超级天线，但八年前那次试验中为什么没有收到回波．为什么木星的辐射渡形与后来的太阳辐射对不上?叶文洁后来想出了许多原因，基地的电台可能根本不能接收那个频段的电渡．或者收到后只是一甸嗓音，就认为是什么都没有收到。至于后者，很可能是因为太阳在放大电波的同时．还叠加了一个波形．这个波形是有规律的，在外星文明的译解系境中根容易被剔除．但在她的肉眼看来．木星和太阳的辐射波形就大不相同了。这一点后来得到了证实。叠加的是一个正弦波。\n     她警觉地四下看看。主机房中值班的还有三人．其中两人在一个角落聊天，一人在终端前打睦睡．而在监听系统的信息处理部分．能够查看接收内容识别度和访问译解系统的终端只有她面前这两台。她不动声色地迅速操作．将已接收到的信息全部转存到一个多重加密的隐形子目录中。用一年前接收到的一段噪声代替了这五个小时的内容。\n     然后．她从终端上将一段简短的信息输入红  岸发射系统的缓存区。\n     叶文洁起身走出了监听主控室的大门，一阵冷风吹到她滚烫的脸上．东方晨曦初露，她沿着被晨光微微照亮的石子路，向发射主控室走去，在她的上方，红岸天线的巨掌无声地向宇宙张开着。晨曦照出了门口哨兵那黑色的剪影，像往常一样．叶文洁进门时他没有理会。发射主控室比监听主控室要暗许多．叶文洁穿过一排排机柜．径直走向控制台，熟练地扳动十几个开关，启动了发射系统的预热。坐在控制台旁边的两名值班员抬起头用困乏的眼睛看了看她，其中一人又扭头看了看墙上的钟表，然后一人继续打瞌睡，另一人则翻看着可能已看了许多遍的报纸。在基地里，叶文洁在政治上自然没有任何地位，但在技术上有一定的自由．她常常在发射前检查设备．虽然今天太早了些，距发射操作还有三个小时，但提前预热也是不奇怪的。\n     漫长的半个小时过去了，叶文洁在这期间重设了发射频率，将其置于太阳能量镜面反射的最优值上．将发射功率设为最大值，然后，她将双限凑近�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>叶文洁<|>PERSON<|>叶文洁 is a
