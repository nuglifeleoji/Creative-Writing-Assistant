It was a bad moment and he took the time to recover, clinging to a three-point hold on the Wall. Almost of its own accord, his free hand groped upward once more, wriggling past the rotten place into another slender crack. Slowly, he shifted his weight onto that hand. Slowly . . . slowly. His left knee felt the place where a toehold could be achieved. He lifted his foot to that place, tested it. Memory told him the top was near, but he pushed the memory aside. There was only the climb and the knowledge that Leto would arrive tomorrow.\nLeto and Hwi.\nHe could not think about that, either. But it would not go away. The top...Hwi...Leto...tomorrow...\nEvery thought fed his desperation, forced him into the immediate remembrance of the climbs of his childhood. The more he remembered consciously, the more his abilities were blocked. He was forced to pause, breathing deeply in the attempt to center himself, to go back to the natural ways of his past.\nBut were those ways natural?\nThere was a blockage in his mind. He could sense intrusions, a finality .. . the fatality of what might have been and now would never be.\nLeto would arrive up there tomorrow.\nIdaho felt perspiration run down his face around the place where he pressed a cheek against the rock.\nLeto.\n/ will defeat you, Leto. | will defeat you for myself, not for Hwi, but only for myself.\nA sensation of cleansing began to spread through him. It was like the thing which had happened in the night while he prepared himself mentally for this climb. Siona had sensed his sleeplessness. She had begun to talk to him, telling him the smallest details of her desperate run through the Forbidden Forest and her oath at the edge of the river.\n“Now I have given an oath to command his Fish Speakers,” she said. “I will honor that oath, but | hope it will not happen in the way he wants.”\n“What does he want?” Idaho asked.\n“He has many motives and | cannot see them all. Who could possibly understand him? | only know that | will never forgive him.”\nThis memory brought Idaho back to the sensation of the Wall’s rock against his cheek. His perspiration had dried in the light breeze and he felt chilled. But he had found his center.\nNever forgive.\nIdaho felt the ghosts of all his other selves, the gholas who had died in Leto’s service. Could he believe Siona’s suspicions? Yes. Leto was capable of killing with his own body, his own hands. The rumor which Siona recounted had a feeling of truth in it. And Siona, too, was Atreides. Leto had become something else . . . no longer Atreides, not even human. He had become not so much a living creature as a brute fact of nature, opaque and impenetrable, all of\nhis experiences sealed off within him. And Siona opposed him. The real Atreides turned away from him.\nAs I do.\nA brute fact of nature, nothing more. Just like this Wall.\nIdaho’s right hand groped upward and found a sharp ledge. He could feel nothing above the ledge and tried to remember a wide crack at this place in the pattern. He could not dare to allow himself into the belief that he had reached the top ... not yet. The sharp edge cut into his fingers as he put his weight on it. He brought his left hand up to that level, found a purchase and pulled himself slowly upward. His eyes reached the level of his hands. He stared across a flat space which reached outward... outward into blue sky. The surface where his hands clutched showed ancient weather cracks. He crawled his fingers across that surface, one hand at a time, seeking out the cracks, dragging his chest up... his waist... his hips. He rolled then, twisting and crawling until the Wall was far behind him. Only then did he stand and tell himself what his senses reported.\nThe top. And he had not required pitons or hammer.\nA faint sound reached him. Cheering?\nHe walked back to the edge and looked down, waving to them. Yes, they were cheering. Turning back, he strode to the center of the roadway, letting elation still the trembling of his muscles, soothe the aching of his shoulders. Slowly, he turned full circle, examining the top while he let his memories at last estimate the height of that climb.\nNine hundred meters... at least that.\nThe Royal Roadway interested him. It was not like what he had seen on the way to Onn. It was wide, wide... at least five hundred meters. The roadbed was a smooth, unbroken gray with its edge some one hundred meters from each lip of the Wall. Rock pillars at man height marked the road’s edge, stretching away like sentinels along the path Leto would use.\nIdaho walked to the far side of the Wall opposite the Sareer and peered down. Far away in the depths, a hurtling green flow of river battered itself into foam against buttress rocks. He looked to the right. Leto would come from there. Road and Wall curved gently to the right, the curve beginning about three hundred meters from the place where Idaho stood. Idaho returned to the road and walked along its edge, following the curve until it made a returning “S” and narrowed, sloping gently downward. He stopped and looked at what was revealed for him, seeing the new pattern take shape.\nAbout three kilometers away down the gentle slope, the roadway narrowed and crossed the river gorge on a bridge whose faery trusses appeared insubstantial and toylike at this distance. Idaho remembered a similar bridge on the road to Onn, the substantial feel of it beneath his feet. He trusted his memory, thinking about bridges as a military leader was forced to think about the m—passages or traps.\nMoving out to his left, he looked down and outward to another high Wall at the far anchor of the faery bridge. The road continued there, turning gently until it was a line running straight northward. There were two Walls along there and the river between them. The river glided in a man-made chasm, its moisture confined and channeled into a northward wind-drift while the water itself flowed southward.\nIdaho ignored the river then. It was there and it would be there tomorrow. He fixed his attention on the bridge, letting his military training examine it. He nodded once to himself before turning back the way he had come, lifting the light rope from his shoulders as he walked.\nIt was only when she saw the rope come snaking down that Nayla had her orgasm.\nWhat am | eliminating? The bourgeois infatuation with peaceful conservation of the past. This is a binding force, a thing which holds humankind into one vulnerable unit in spite of illusionary separations across parsecs of space. If | can find the scattered bits, others can find them. When you are together, you can share a common catastrophe. You can be exterminated together. Thus, | demonstrate the terrible danger of a gliding, passionless mediocrity, a movement without ambitions or aims. | show you that entire civilizations can do this thing. | give you eons of life which slips gently toward death without fuss or stirring, without even asking “Why?” | show you the false happiness and the shadow-catastrophe called Leto, the God Emperor. Now, will you learn the real happiness?\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nH aving spent the night with only one brief catnap, Leto was awake when Moneo emerged from the guest house at dawn. The Royal Cart had been parked almost in the center of a three-sided courtyard. The cart’s cover had been set on one-way Opaque, concealing its occupant, and was tightly sealed against moisture. Leto could hear the faint stirring of the fans which pulsed his air through a drying cycle.\nMoneo’s feet scratched on the courtyard’s cobbles as he approached the cart. Dawnlight edged the guest house roof with orange above the majordomo.\nLeto opened the cart’s cover as Moneo stopped in front of him. There was a yeasting dirt smell to the air and the accumulation of moisture in the breeze was painful.\n“We should arrive at Tuono about noon,” Moneo said. “l wish you'd let me bring in ‘thopters to guard the sky.”\n“I do not want 'thopters,” Leto said. “We can go down to Tuono on suspensors and ropes.”\nLeto marveled at the plastic images in this brief exchange. Moneo had never liked peregrinations. His youth\nas a rebel had left him with suspicions of everything he could not see or label. He remained a mass of latent judgments.\n“You know | don’t want ‘thopters for transport,” Moneo said. “I want them to guard...”\n“Yes, Moneo.”\nMoneo looked past Leto at the open end of the courtyard which overlooked the river canyon. Dawnlight was frosting the mist which arose from the depths. He thought of how far down that canyon dropped... a body twisting, twisting as it fell. Moneo had found himself unable to go to the canyon’s lip last night and peer down into it. The drop was sucha... such a temptation.\nWith that insightful power which filled Moneo with such awe, Leto said: “There’s a lesson in every temptation, Moneo.”\nSpeechless, Moneo turned to stare directly into Leto’s eyes.\n“See the lesson in my life, Moneo.”\n“Lord?” It was only a whisper.\n“They tempt me first with evil, then with good. Each temptation is fashioned with exquisite attention to my susceptibilities. Tell me, Moneo, if | choose the good, does that make me good?”\n“Of course it does, Lord.”\n“Perhaps you will never lose the habit of judgment,” Leto said.\nMoneo looked away from him once more and stared at the chasm’s edge. Leto rolled his body to look where Moneo looked. Dwarf pines had been cultured along the lip of the canyon. There were hanging dewdrops on the damp needles, each of them sending a promise of pain to Leto. He longed to close the cart’s cover, but there was an immediacy in those jewels which attracted his memories even while they repelled his body. The opposed synchrony threatened to fill him with turmoil.\n“I just don’t like going around on foot,” Moneo said.\n“It was the Fremen way,” Leto said.\nMoneo sighed. “The others will be ready in a few minutes. Hwi was breakfasting when | came out.”\nLeto did not respond. His thoughts were lost in memories of night—the one just past and the millennial others which crowded his pasts—clouds and stars, the rains and the open blackness pocked with glittering flakes from a shredded cosmos, a universe of nights, extravagant with them as he had been with his heartbeats.\nMoneo suddenly demanded: “Where are your guards?”\n“I sent them to eat.”\n“I don’t like them leaving you unguarded!”\nThe crystal sound of Moneo’s voice rang in Leto’s memories, speaking things not cast in words. Moneo feared a universe where there was no God Emperor. He would rather die than see such a universe.\n“What will happen today?” Moneo demanded.\nIt was a question directed not to the God Emperior but to the prophet.\n“A seed blown on the wind could be tomorrow’s willow tree,” Leto said.\n“You know our future! Why won’t you share it?” Moneo was close to hysteria. . . refusing anything his immediate senses did not report.\nLeto turned\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_02848d24549595ca206a1046a6fd3c4a5024763ef97a31b2be6e2c8a517bab4f_v2"}
