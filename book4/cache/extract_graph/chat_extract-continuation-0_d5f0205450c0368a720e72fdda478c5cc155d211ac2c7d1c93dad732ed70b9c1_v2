\n　　“行！”铁匠师傅用铁钳夹了一块红炭火给他伸过来。少安赶忙凑上去点着了那支烟棒。他听口音，知道铁匠是河南人。黄土高原几乎所有的铁匠都是河南人。河南人是中国的吉普赛人，全国任何地方都可以看见这些不择生活条件的劳动者。试想，如果出国就象出省一样容易的话，那么全世界也会到处遍布河南人的足迹。他们和吉普赛人不一样。吉普赛人只爱飘泊，不爱劳动。但河南人除过个别不务正业者之外，不论走到哪里，都用自己的劳动技能来换取报酬。 \n　　孙少安点着烟后，因为离炉火站得近，他才感到浑身一阵发冷。他于是跹蹴在炉边，伸出两只手想烤一烤火。“这么晚了，你还不睡啊？你是哪儿的？”河南老师傅一边拉风箱，一边问他。 \n　　少安对他说：“我是双水村的，给队里的牛看病，天晚了，还没寻下个住处……” \n　　那位年轻徒弟说：“旅社恐怕人都住满了。” \n　　“就是的……”少安脑子里继续盘算他到哪里去过夜。“我看你今晚找不下地方了……这镇上有没有熟人？”老师傅问他。 \n　　“没。”少安对他说。 \n　　“噢……”师傅用铁钳拨弄着炭火里的铁块，说：“你要是实在没去处，不嫌俺这地方，可以凑合一下，不过没铺没盖。可这地方还暖和……”河南人由于自己经常到处飘流浪游，因此对任何出门人都有一种同情心；他们乐意帮助有困难的过路人。 \n　　少安一下子高兴得站起来，说：“行！老师傅，这就给你老添麻烦了……” \n　　的确，他很感激这个河南老师傅。没铺盖算什么，他能在这火边跹蹴到天明就行了，总比一晚上蹲在野场地挨冷受冻强。 \n　　少安问师傅：“这么晚你们还干活？” \n　　徒弟回答他说：“这件活说好明早上人家来取，不加班不行。” \n　　少安看炉灶里的铁烧红了，就从口袋里掏出两根“金丝猴”纸烟，走过去对那个年轻徒弟说：“师傅，你先歇着抽支烟，让我来替你添几下锤！” \n　　那徒弟看他这样实心，就很乐意地接过纸烟，把手中的铁锤让给少安。 \n　　少安又把另一根纸烟，恭敬地夹在执钳操锤的老师傅的耳朵上——老师傅现在不仅没空抽，甚至腾不出手来接烟卷。 \n　　等老师傅把烧红的铁块放在铁砧子上后，少安就抡起锤和老汉一人一下打起来。他因为常出去为队里修理损坏的农具，曾在�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少安<|>PERSON<|>少安 is a character who is
