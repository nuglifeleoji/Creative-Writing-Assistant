罗辑听到医生喊“下一个”，他吃力地扭头，看到又有一张床移进苏醒室，床上也有一个显然是刚从冬眠室中送来的人。那张床很快移人了一堆仪器中问，医生的白大褂变成纯白色，他用手指在墙上点丁一下，有三分之一的墙面被激活成显示屏，上面显示着复杂的曲线和数据，医生开始紧张地操作。\n　　罗辑这时明白，自己的苏醒可能并不是一件重大的事，而只是这里进行的日常工作的一部分。那个医生很友善，但罗辑在他眼中显然只是一名普通的冬眠者而已。\n　　同苏醒室中一样，走廊中没有灯，亮光也是直接从墙壁发出的，虽然很柔和，还是让罗辑眯起了双眼。就在他眯眼的同时，这一段走廊的墙壁暗了下来，这黯淡的一段一直跟随着他的床移动。当他的眼睛适应光亮又睁大时，这移动的一段也随之亮了起来，但亮度一直保持在舒适的范围内。看来，走廊的光度调节系统能够监测他的瞳孔变化。\n　　从这件事看，这是一个很人性化的时代。\n　　这大大出乎罗辑的预料。\n　　在缓缓移过的走廊墙壁上，罗辑也看到了许多被激活的显示区，它们大小不一，随机点缀在墙上，其中一部分还显示着罗辑来不及看清的动态图像，好像是使用者离开时忘记关闭而留下的。\n　　罗辑不时与走廊上的行人和自动行走的病床交错而过，他注意到在行人的脚底和床的轮子与地面的接触处，都压出了发光的水样的波纹，就像在他自己的时代用手指接触液晶显示屏时出现的那样。整个长长的走廊，给他的最强烈的感觉就是洁净，洁净得像是电脑中的三维动画，但罗辑知道这一切都是真实的。他移动于其中，有一种从未体会过的宁静和舒适。\n　　最令罗辑心动的是他沿途遇到的人们，不论是医生护士，还是其他人，看上去都整洁高雅，走近时，都亲切地向他微笑致意，有的还向他挥挥手。他们的衣服也都映出绚美的图案，每个人的风格都不同，有的写实有的抽象。罗辑被他们的目光所慑服，他知道，普通人的目光，是他们所在地区和时代的文明程度的最好反映。他曾经看到过一组由欧洲摄影师拍摄的清朝末年的照片，最深的印象就是照片上的人呆滞的目光，在那些照片上，不论是官员还是百姓，眼睛中所透出的只有麻木和愚钝，看不到一点生气。现在，这个新时代的人看到罗辑的眼睛时，可能也是那种感觉了。在与罗辑相视的目光中，充满着睿智的生机，以及他在自己的时代很少感受到的真诚、理解和爱意。但从心灵的最深处打动罗辑的，是人们目光中的自信，这种阳光般的自信充�\n######################\nOutput:",
