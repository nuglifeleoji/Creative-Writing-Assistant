It was under threat from Cao Cao's advancing troops, which led 刘备 to contemplate abandoning the city to ensure the safety of his people. The city was besieged multiple times, notably during the military campaigns involving notable generals such as 云长 (Guan Yu) and 曹仁 (Cao Ren). Reports indicate that 樊城 was under siege from 云长's forces, which were overwhelming, and it served as a defensive stronghold for 曹仁 against these attacks.\n\n樊城 was also a site of significant military victories, including a notable triumph for 刘备, which underscored its importance in the power struggles of the era.

He was appointed as one of the naval commanders (水军都督) by Cao Cao, where he worked alongside other generals like Mao Jie to oversee naval operations.
