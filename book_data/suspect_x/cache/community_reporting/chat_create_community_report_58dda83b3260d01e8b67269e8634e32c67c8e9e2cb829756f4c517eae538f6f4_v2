A critical component of the spice trade, it operates primarily on rich, uncontaminated spice deposits, often referred to as \"\"blows.\"\" These massive machines, sometimes called \"\"crawlers,\"\" are essential for efficiently gathering melange, a resource of immense economic and strategic importance.  \n\nFunctioning as both a mining and processing facility, the Harvester Factory traverses the desert landscape, sifting through the sand to collect spice while filtering out contaminants. Its mobility allows it to relocate to new spice-rich areas as needed, maximizing yield. Due to the harsh conditions of Arrakis and the ever-present threat of sandworms, Harvester Factories are heavily fortified and equipped with defensive measures to protect both the machinery and the crew operating it.  \n\nIn summary, the Harvester Factory is a vital industrial asset on Arrakis, enabling large-scale spice extraction and playing a central role in sustaining the interstellar spice trade.
