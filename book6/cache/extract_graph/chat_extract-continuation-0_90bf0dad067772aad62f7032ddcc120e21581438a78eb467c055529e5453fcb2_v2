前的局面有一个正确的理解：虽然这件事我们没有责任，但媒体不管这个，林格——斐兹罗系统毕竟是负责对探测器进行深空跟踪的，到最后相当一部分脏水还得泼到我们头上。”\n　　肯没有说话，身体与将军垂直，想了一会儿，他问：“现在在海王星轨道外面还有些什么可利用的东西？”\n　　“舰队方面大概什么也没有了，地球方面……”将军转向值勤军官，向他们询问。他很快得知，在海王星有四艘联合国环境保护组织的大型飞船，从事“雾伞”\n　　丁程的前期开发，即将担任跟踪探测器任务的三艘小型飞船就是从这些飞船上派出的。\n　　“它们是去开采油膜矿吗？”肯问道，他马上得到了肯定的回答。油膜矿是在海王星的星环中发现的一种物质，它能够在高温下变成迅速扩散的气体，然后在太空中冷凝成微小的纳米颗粒，形成太空尘埃。之所以叫这个名称，是因为这种物质蒸发后的气体在太空中扩散性很强，少量物质就可以形成大片尘埃，其过程与小小的油滴在水面扩散成大片分子厚度的油膜相似。油膜物质所形成的太空尘埃还有另一特性：与其他的太空尘埃不同，“油膜尘埃”很难被太阳风所驱散。\n　　正是由于油膜物质的发现，使“雾伞”计划成为可能，这个计划是用核爆炸在太空中蒸发和扩散油膜物质，在太阳与地球之间形成一团“油膜尘埃”，降低太阳对地球的辐射，达到缓解地球温室效应的目的。\n　　“我记得，海王星轨道附近应该还有前战争时期的恒星型核弹吧？”肯又问。\n　　“有的，‘雾伞’工程的飞船也装载了一些，在海王星环和卫星上爆破用，具体数目不清楚。”\n　　“好像一颗就够了。”肯兴奋起来。\n　　两个世纪前面壁者雷迪亚兹的战略计划中所研制的恒星型氢弹，后来共制造了五千多颗。虽然这种武器在末日之战中作用有限，但正如雷迪亚兹所言，各大国主要是为可能爆发的人类之间的行星际战争准备的，核弹主要在大低谷时期制造，那时由于资源的匮乏，国际关系极其紧张，人类自身的战争一触即发。进入新时期后，这些骇人听闻的武器成了危险的鸡肋，虽然其所有权都属于地球国家，但还是都被送入太空存贮，少部分已经用于行星工程的爆破，还有一部分送入太阳系外围轨道。曾有人设想将核弹中的聚变材料可以作为远程飞船的燃料补充，但由于核弹的拆解很困难，这个设想一直没有真正实现过。\n　　“你觉得能行，”罗宾逊两眼放光地问道，他后悔这么简单的\n######################\nOutput:",
