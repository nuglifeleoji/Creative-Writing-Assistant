，给乡上和县上的机关发出请贴，让他们都来参加。你破费一点钱，办几桌酒席，晚上再包一场电影，把气氛造得轰轰烈烈。你现在又不是出不起这两个钱？再说，钱是小事，关键是个政治影响！你既然要刮风下雨，为什么不先来个吼雷打闪？你连光荣都不会光荣！”孙玉亭说到兴头上，竟然居高临下指教开了侄儿。 \n　　二爸的一番话倒使少安大吃一惊，没想到这个破败的“革命老前辈”现在还保持着这么高昂的“政治”激情。 \n　　吃惊之余，少安才细细思量，他二爸这个提示说不定还有些“意思”哩。说老实话，在此之前，他可从没往这方面想。因为村中许多人缺钱花而求到他门上。他也诚心想帮助这些人，这才促使他扩建了砖场。既然如今事情到了这一步，按二爸说的，宣扬一下又有什么不好？孙家已经晦气了几辈子，利用这机会冲冲晦气也值得！另外，那年他冒充了一回冒尖户，心里很不美气，总想堂堂正正在世人面前“光荣”一回……好，现在这也许正是个机会！ \n　　不过，他又盘算，人家上面的干部会不会接受他一个老百姓的邀请，来参加这样一个仪式呢？ \n　　当他吱唔着对二爸提出这个疑问后，孙玉亭立刻胸有成竹地说：“没问题！上面正打着灯笼寻找这号先进典型哩！出了这号典型，也是他们的成绩。不怕！这事如果你情愿，就交给我来办！准保落不了空！” \n　　孙少安被他二爸煽得心火缭乱。他即刻去征求“内当家”的意见。秀莲满心支持，说：“二爸这主意好！过了事情，你还能认识上面的干部，以后也好办事！”秀莲把孙玉亭策划的“政治活动”说成了“过事情”——就象农村办婚嫁喜事一样，尽管说法不同，基本也就是那么一回事！ \n　　少安放话以后，孙玉亭立刻紧张地行动起来，他就象当年帮助田福堂“闹革命”一样，拖拉着一双缀麻绳的破鞋，兴奋地前后村乱跑，连自家地里的活都不干了，撂给了他的大女儿卫红。 \n　　孙玉亭先张罗着在自家土炕的破席片下，找出了几张春节写对联剩下的红纸，让凤英剪了一叠“请柬”，由他亲自用毛笔填写好邀请的单位和人名；接着就火烧屁股一般蹿到了乡上。因为乡长刘根民是少安的同学，少安自己不好意思去，就把这些事全权交给二爸去执行。 \n　　我们真没有想到，玉亭在新形势下仍然可以发挥自己的“特长”。我们更想不到，他这次竟然利用这特长为“资本主义”鸣锣击鼓！无论如何，这孙玉亭还是孙玉亭，虽说“政治\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
