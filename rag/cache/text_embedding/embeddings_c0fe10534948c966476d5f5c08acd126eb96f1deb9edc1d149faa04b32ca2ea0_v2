She saw furnishings with permaflox fabrics. And behind the fabrics She felt plastic resilience. Everything done in the other colors of the rooms.\nThe bed was a small shock. Someone had taken the request for a hard mat too literally. Flat surface of black plaz without cushion. No bedding.\nSuipol, seeing this, started to object but Odrade silenced her. Despite Bene Gesserit resources, comfort sometimes fell by the wayside. Get the job done! That was their first order. If Mother Superior had to sleep occasionally on a hard surface without covers, this could be passed off in the name of duty. Besides, the Bene Gesserit had ways of adjusting to such inconsequentials. Odrade steeled herself to discomfort, aware that if she objected she might find another deliberate insult.\nLet them add this to all of that unconscious content and worry about it.\nHer summons came while she was inspecting the rest of their quarters, displaying minimal concern and open amusement. A voice piped through ceiling vents intruded as Odrade and her companions emerged into the common sitting room: “Return to the lobby where you will meet your escort to Great Honored Matre.”\n“I will go alone,” Odrade said, silencing objections.\nA green-robed Honored Matre waited on a fragile chair where the corridor entered the lobby. She had a face built up like a castle wall—stone laid on stone. Mouth a watergate through which she inhaled some liquid via a transparent straw. Flow of purple up the straw. Sugar odor in the liquid. The eyes were weapons peeking over ramparts. Nose: a Slope down which eyes dispatched their hatred. Chin: weak. Not necessary, that chin. An afterthought. Something left over from earlier construction. You could see the infant in it. And hair: artificially darkened to muddy brown. Unimportant. Eyes, nose, and mouth, those were important.\nThe woman stood slowly, insolently, emphasizing what a favor she did merely by noticing Odrade.\n“Great Honored Matre agrees to see you.”\nHeavy, almost masculine voice. Pride walled up so high she exposed it whatever she did. Packed solid with immovable prejudice. She knew so many things she was a walking display of ignorance and fears. Odrade saw her as a perfect demonstration of Honored Matre vulnerability.\nAt the end of many turnings and corridors, all of them bright and clean, they came to a long room—sun pouring in a line of windows, sophisticated military console at one end; space maps and terrain maps projected there. Center of Spider Queen’s web? Odrade entertained doubts. Console too obvious. Something of different design from the Scattering but no mistaking its purpose. Fields that humans could manipulate had physical limits, and a hood for mental interface could be nothing else even though it was a towering oval shape and a peculiar dirty yellow.\nShe swept her gaze over the room. Sparsely furnished. A few slingchairs and small tables, a large open area where (presumably) people could await orders. No clutter. This was Supposed to be an action center.\nImpress that upon the witch!\nWindows on one long wall revealed flagstones and gardens beyond. This whole thing was a set piece!\nWhere is Spider Queen? Where does she sleep? What is the appearance of her lair?\nTwo women came in through an arched doorway from the flagstones. Both wore red robes with glittering arabesques and dragon shapes on them. Soostones shattered for decorations.\nOdrade held her silence, exercising caution until after introductions by the escort, who uttered as few words as possible and left hurriedly.\nWithout Murbella’s hints, the tall one standing beside Spider Queen was the one Odrade would have taken for commander. But it was the smaller one. Fascinating.\nThis one did not just climb to power. She sneaked between the cracks. One day, her Sisters awoke to\naccomplished fact. There she was, firmly seated at the center. And who could object? Ten minutes after leaving her you would have difficulty remembering the target of your objections.\nThe two women examined Odrade with equal intensity.\nWell and good. That is needed at this moment.\nSpider Queen’s appearance was more than a Surprise. Until this moment, no physical description of her had been achieved by the Bene Gesserit. Only temporary projections, imaginative constructs based on scattered bits of evidence. Here she was, finally. A small woman. Expected stringy muscles visible under red leotards beneath her robe. Face a forgettable oval with bland brown eyes, orange flecks dancing in them.\nFearful and angered by it but cannot place the precise reasons for her fear. All she has Is a target—me. What does she think to gain from me?\nThe aide was something else: in appearance, far more dangerous. Golden hair so carefully coiffed, slight hook to the nose, thin lips, skin stretched tightly over high cheekbones. And that venemous glare.\nOdrade passed her gaze once more over Spider Queen’s features: a nose that some would have trouble describing a minute after leaving her.\nStraight? Well, somewhat.\nEyebrows a match to straw-colored hair. The mouth opened to become pinkly visible and almost vanished when closed. It was a face in which you had difficulty finding a central focus and thus the entire thing became blurred.\n“So you lead the Bene Gesserit.”\nVoice equally low-key. Oddly inflected Galach and no jargon, yet you sensed it just behind her tongue. Linguistic tricks were there. Murbella’s knowledge emphasized that.\n“They have something close to Voice. Not the equal of what you gave me but there are other things they do, word tricks of a sort.”\nWord tricks.\n“How should | address you?” Odrade asked.\n“| hear you call me the Spider Queen.” Orange flecks dancing viciously in her eyes.\n“Here at the center of your web and considering your vast powers, |’m afraid | must confess to it.”\n“So that is what you notice—my powers.” Vain!\nThe first thing Odrade actually had marked was the woman’s smell. She was bathed in some outrageous perfume.\nCovering up pheromones?\nWarned about Bene Gesserit ability to judge on the basis of minuscule sense data? Perhaps. Just as probably she preferred this perfume. The odious concoction had about it an underlying hint of exotic flowers. Something from her homeland?\nThe Spider Queen put a hand to her forgettable chin. “You may call me Dama.”\nThe companion objected. “This is the last enemy in the Million Planets!”\nSo that’s how they think of the Old Empire.\nDama held up a hand for silence. How casual and how revealing. Odrade saw a luster reminiscent of Bellonda in the aide’s eyes. Viciousness watchful in there and looking for places to attack.\n“Most are required to address me as Great Honored Matre,” Dama said. “I have conferred an honor upon you.” She gestured toward the arched doorway behind her. “We will walk outside, just the two of us, while we talk.”\nNo invitation; it was a command.\nOdrade paused beside the door to look at a map displayed there. Black on white, little lines of paths and irregular outlines with labels in Galach. It was the gardens beyond the flagstones, identification of plantings. Odrade bent close to study it while Dama waited with amused tolerance. Yes, esoteric trees and bushes, very few bearing\nedible fruits. Pride of possession and this map was here to emphasize it.\nOn the patio, Odrade said: “I noticed your perfume.”\nDama was thrown back into memories and her voice carried subtle undertones when she responded.\nFloral identity marker for her own flamebush. Imagine that! But she is both sad and angry when she thinks of this. And she wonders why I bring it to attention.\n“Otherwise, the bush would not have accepted me,” Dama said.\nInteresting choice of verb tense.\nThe accented Galach was not hard to understand. She obviously adjusted unconsciously for the listener.\nGood ear. Spends a few seconds, watching, listening and adjusts to make herself understood. Very old art form that most humans adopt quickly.\nOdrade saw the origins as protective coloration.\nDon’t want to be taken for an alien.\nAn adjustable characteristic built into the genes. Honored Matres had not lost it but this was a vulnerability. Unconscious tonalities were not completely covered and they revealed much.\nDespite her blatant vanity, Dama was intelligent and self- disciplined. It was a pleasure to come to that opinion. Certain circumlocutions were not necessary.\nOdrade stopped where Dama stopped at the edge of the patio. They stood almost shoulder to shoulder and Odrade, gazing outward at the garden, was struck by the almost Bene Gesserit appearance.\n“Speak your piece,” Dama said.\n“What value do | have as a hostage?” Odrade asked.\nOrange glare!\n“You've obviously asked the question,” Odrade said.\n“Do continue.” Orange subsiding.\n“The Sisterhood has three replacements for me.” Odrade produced her most penetrating stare. “It is possible for us to\nweaken each other in ways that would destroy us both.”\n“We could crush you as we would swat an insect!”\nBeware the orange!\nOdrade was not deflected by warnings from within. “But the hand that swatted us would fester, and eventually, sickness would consume you.”\nIt could not be stated plainer without specific details.\n“Impossible!” An orange glare.\n“Do you think us unaware of how you were driven back here by your enemies?”\nMy most dangerous gambit.\nOdrade watched it take effect. A dark scowl was not Dama’s only visible response. Orange vanished, leaving her eyes an oddly bland discrepancy on the glowering face.\nOdrade nodded as though Dama had answered. “We could leave you vulnerable to those who assail you, those who drove you into this cul de sac.”\n“You think we...”\n“We know.”\nAt least, now | know.\nThe knowledge produced both elation and fear.\nWhat is out there to subdue these women?\n“We merely gather our forces before—”\n“Before returning to an arena where you are sure to be crushed ... where you cannot count on overwhelming numbers.”\nDama’s voice relapsed into soft Galach that Odrade had difficulty understanding. “So they have been to you... and made their offer. What fools you are to trust the...”\n“I have not said we trust.”\n“If Logno back there .. .” Nod of head indicating the aide in the room “...heard you talking to me this way you would be dead in less time than I take to warn you of it.”\n“I am fortunate there are only the two of us.”\n“Don’t count on that to carry you much farther.”\nOdrade glanced over her shoulder at the building. Alterations in Guild design were visible: a long façade of windows, much exotic wood and jeweled stones.\nWealth.\nShe was dealing with wealth in an extreme it would be hard for some to imagine. Nothing Dama wanted, nothing that could be provided by the society subservient to her, would be denied. Nothing except freedom to go back into the Scattering.\nHow firmly did Dama cling to the fantasy that her exile might end? And what was the force that had driven such power back to the Old Empire? Why here? Odrade dared not ask.\n“We will continue this in my quarters,” Dama said.\nInto the Spider Queen’s lair at last!\nDama’s quarters were a bit of a puzzle. Richly carpeted floors. She kicked off sandals and went barefoot on entering. Odrade followed this lead.\nLook at the callused flesh along the outsides of her feet! Dangerous", "drade glanced over her shoulder at the building.

She kicked off sandals and went barefoot on entering. Odrade followed this lead.\nLook at the callused flesh along the outsides of her feet! Dangerous weapons kept well-conditioned.\nNot the soft floor but the room itself puzzled Odrade. One Small window looking over the carefully manicured botanical garden. No hangings or pictures on the walls. No decorations. An air vent grill drew shadowy stripes above the door they had entered. One other door on the right. Another air vent. Two soft gray couches. Two small side tables in glistening black. Another larger table in tones of gold with a green shimmer above it to indicate a control field. Odrade identified the fine rectangular outline of a projector inset into the golden table.\nAhhhh, this ts her workroom. Are we here to work?\nA refined concentration about this place. Care had been taken to eliminate distractions. What distractions would Dama accept?\nWhere are the decorated rooms? She has to live in particular ways with her surroundings. You cannot always be\nforming mental barriers to reject things around you that sit disagreeably in your psyche. If you want real comfort, your home cannot be set up in a way that attacks you, especially no attacks on the unconscious side. She is aware of unconscious vulnerabilities! This one is truly dangerous but she has the power to say “Yes.”\nIt was an ancient Bene Gesserit insight. You looked for the ones who could say “Yes.” Never bother with underlings who can only say “No.” You sought the one who could make an agreement, sign a contract, pay off on a promise. Spider Queen did not often say “Yes” but she had that power and knew it.\n| should have realized when she took me aside. She sent me the first signal when she permitted me to call her Dama. Have | been too precipitate, setting up Teg’s attack in a way | cannot stop? Too late for second thoughts. | knew it when | unleashed him.\nBut what other forces may we attract?\nOdrade had Dama’s dominance pattern registered. Words and gestures were likely to make Spider Queen recoil, crouching back to intense awareness of her own heartbeats.\nThe drama must go forward.\nDama was doing something with her hands in the green field atop the golden table. She concentrated on it, ignoring Odrade in a way that was both insult and compliment.\nYou will not interfere, witch, because that is not in your best interest and you know it. Besides, you are not important enough to distract me.\nDama appeared agitated.\nHas the attack on Gammu been successful? Are refugees beginning to arrive?\nAn orange glare focused on Odrade. “Your pilot has just destroyed himself and your ship rather than submit to our inspection. What did you bring?”\n“Ourselves.”\n“There is a signal coming from you!”\n“Telling my companions whether | am alive or dead. You already knew that. Some of our ancestors burned their ships before an attack. No retreat possible.”\nOdrade spoke with exquisite care, tone and timing adjusted to Dama’s responses. “If | am successful, you will provide my transport. My pilot was a Cyborg and shere could not protect him from your probes. His orders were to kill himself rather than fall into your hands.”\n“Providing us with coordinates to your planet.” The orange subsided from Dama’s eyes, but she still was disturbed. “I did not think your people obeyed you to that extent.”\nHow do you hold them without sexual bonding, witch? Is the answer not obvious? We have secret powers.\nCareful now, Odrade cautioned herself. A methodical approach, alert for new demands. Let her think we choose one method of response and stick to it. How much does she know about us? She does not know that even Mother Superior may be only a morsel of bait, a lure to gain vital information. Does that make us superior? If so, can superior training surmount superior soeed and numbers?\nOdrade had no answer.\nDama seated herself behind the golden table, leaving Odrade standing. There was a nesting sense about the movement. She did not leave this place often. This was the true center of her web. All things she thought she needed were here. She had brought Odrade to this room because it was an inconvenience to be elsewhere. She was uncomfortable in other settings, perhaps even felt threatened. Dama did not court danger. She had done so once but that was long ago, shut off behind her somewhere. Now, she wanted only to sit here in a safe and well- organized cocoon where she could manipulate others.\nOdrade found these observations a welcome affirmation of Bene Gesserit deductions. The Sisterhood knew how to exploit this leverage.\n“Have you nothing more to say?” Dama asked.\nStall for time.\nOdrade ventured a question. “I am extremely curious why you agreed to this meeting?”\n“Why are you curious?”\n“It seems so... so out of character for you.”\n“We determine what is in character for us!” Quite testy there.\n“But what is it about us interests you?”\n“You think we find you interesting?”\n“Perhaps you even find us remarkable, because that is certainly how we look at you.”\nA pleased expression made its fleeting appearance on Dama’s face. “I knew you would be fascinated by us.”\n“The exotic interests the exotic,” Odrade said.\nThis brought a knowing smile to Dama’s lips, the smile of someone whose pet has been clever. She stood and went to the one window. Summoning Odrade to her side, Dama gestured to a stand of trees beyond the first flowering bushes and spoke in that soft accent so difficult to follow.\nSomething ticked off an inner alarm. Odrade fell into simulflow, seeking the source. Something in the room or in Spider Queen? There was a lack of spontaneity about the setting matched by much that Dama did. So all of this was designed to create an effect. Carefully schemed.\nIs this one really my Spider Queen? Or is there a more powerful one watching us?\nOdrade explored this thought, sorting swiftly. It was a process that provided more questions than answers, a mental shorthand akin to that of Mentats. Sort for relevance and bring up the latent (but orderly) backgrounds. Order generally was a product of human activity. Chaos existed as raw material from which to create order. That was the Mentat approach, giving no unalterable truths but a remarkable lever for decision-making: orderly assemblage of data in a non-discrete system.\nShe arrived at a Projective.\nThey revel in chaos! Prefer it! Adrenaline addicts!\nSo Dama was Dama, Great Honored Matre. Forever the patroness, forever the superior.\nThere is no greater one watching us. But Dama believes this is bargaining. One would think she had never done it before. Precisely!\nDama touched an unmarked place below the window and the wall folded back, revealing that the window was but an artful projection. The way was opened onto a high balcony paved with dark green tiles. It overlooked plantations much different from those in the window projection. Here was chaos preserved, wilderness left to its own devices and made more remarkable by ordered gardens in the distance. Brambles, fallen trees, thick bushes. And beyond: evenly spaced rows of what appeared to be vegetables with automated harvesters passing back and forth, leaving bare ground behind them.\nLove of chaos, indeed!\nSpider Queen smiled and led the way onto the balcony.\nAs she emerged, Odrade once more was stopped by what she saw. A decoration on the parapet to her left. A life-size figure shaped from an almost ethereal substance, all feathery planes and curved surfaces.\nWhen she squinted at the figure, Odrade saw it was intended to represent a human. Male or female? In some positions male, and in some female. Planes and curves responded to vagrant breezes. Thin, almost invisible wires (looked to be shigawire) suspended it from a delicately curving tube anchored in a translucent mound. The lower extremities of the figure almost touched the pebbled surface of the supporting base.\nOdrade stared, captivated.\nWhy does it remind me of Sheeana’s “The Void”?\nWhen the wind moved it, the whole creation appeared to dance, relapsing sometimes into a graceful walk, then a\nslow pirouette and sweeping turns with outstretched leg.\n“It is called ‘Ballet Master,’” Dama said. “In some winds it will kick its feet high. | have seen it running as gracefully as a marathoner. Sometimes it is just ugly little motions, arms jerking as though they held weapons. Beautiful and ugly—it is all the same. I think the artist misnamed it. ‘Being Unknown’ would have been better.”\nBeautiful and ugly—all the same. Being Unknown.\nThat was a terrible thing about Sheena’s creation. Odrade felt a cold wash of fear. “Who was the artist?”\n“I’ve no idea. One of my predecessors took it from a planet we were destroying. Why does it interest you?”\nIt’s the wild thing no one can govern. But she said: “| presume we're both seeking a basis for understanding, trying to find similarities between us.”\nThis brought the orange glare. “You may try to understand us but we have no need to understand you.”\n“Both of us come from societies of women.”\n“It is dangerous to think of us as your offshoots!”\nBut Murbella’s evidence says you are. Formed in the Scattering by Fish Speakers and Reverend Mothers in extremis.\nAll ingenuous and fooling nobody, Odrade asked: “Why is that dangerous?”\nDama’s laugh conveyed no amusement. Vindictive.\nOdrade experienced an abrupt new assessment of danger. More than a Bene Gesserit probe-and-review was demanded here. These women were accustomed to killing when angered. A reflex. Dama had said as much when speaking to her aide, and Dama had just signaled there were limits to her tolerance.\nYet, in her own way, she is trying to bargain. She displays her mechanical marvels, her powers, her wealth. No offer of alliance. Be willing servants, witches, our slaves, and we will forgive much. To gain the last of the Million Planets? More than that, certainly, but an interesting number.\nWith a new caution, Odrade reformed her approach. Reverend Mothers too easily fell into an adaptive pattern. / am, of course, quite different from you but I will unbend for the sake of accord. That would not do with Honored Matres. They would accept nothing to suggest they were not in absolute control. It was a statement of Dama’s superiority over her Sisters that she allowed Odrade so much latitude.\nOnce more, Dama spoke in her imperious manner.\nOdrade listened. How odd that Spider Queen thought one of the most attractive things the Bene Gesserit could provide was immunity from new diseases.\nWas that the form of attack that drove them", " is trying to bargain.

How odd that Spider Queen thought one of the most attractive things the Bene Gesserit could provide was immunity from new diseases.\nWas that the form of attack that drove them here?\nHer sincerity was naive. None of this tiresome periodic checking to see if you had acquired secret inhabitants in your flesh. Sometimes not so secret. Sometimes disgustingly perilous. But the Bene Gesserit could end all that and would be suitably rewarded.\nHow pleasant.\nStill that vindictive tone in every word. Odrade caught herself in this thought: Vindictive? That did not catch the proper flavor. Something carried at a deeper level.\nUnconsciously jealous of what you lost when you broke away from us!\nThis was another pattern and it had been stylized!\nHonored Matres fell back on repetitious mannerisms.\nMannerisms we abandoned long ago.\nThis was more than refusal to recognize Bene Gesserit origins. This was garbage disposal.\nDrop your discards wherever they lose your interest. Underlings take out the garbage. She is more concerned with the next thing she wants to consume than she is with fouling her own nest.\nThe Honored Matre flaw was larger than suspected. Much more deadly to themselves and all they controlled. And they could not face it because, to them, it was not there.\nNever existed.\nDama remained an untouchable paradox. No question of alliance entered her mind. She would seem to dance up to it but only to test her enemy.\n| was right after all to unleash Teg.\nLogno came out of the workroom with a tray on which stood two spindly glasses almost filled with golden liquid. Dama took one, sniffed it, and sipped with a pleased expression.\nWhat is that vicious glitter in Logno’s eyes?\n“Try some of this wine,” Dama said, gesturing to Odrade. “It’s from a planet I’m sure you’ve never heard of but where we have concentrated the required elements to produce the perfect golden grape for the perfect golden wine.”\nOdrade was caught by this long association of humans with their precious ancient drink. The god Bacchus. Berries fermented on the bush or in tribal containers.\n“It is not poisoned,” Dama said as Odrade hesitated. “l assure you. We kill where it suits our needs but we are not crass. We reserve our more blatant deadliness for the masses. | do not mistake you for one of the masses.”\nDama chuckled at her own witticism. The labored friendliness was almost gross.\nOdrade took the proffered glass and sipped.\n“It’s a thing someone devised to please us,” Dama said, her attention fixed on Odrade.\nThe one sip was enough. Odrade’s senses detected a foreign substance and she was several heartbeats identifying its purpose.\nTo nullify the shere protecting me from their probes.\nShe adjusted her metabolism to render the substance harmless, then announced what she had done.\nDama glared at Logno. “So that is why none of these things work with the witches! And you never suspected!” The rage was an almost physical force directed at the hapless aide.\n“It is one of the immune systems with which we combat disease,” Odrade said.\nDama hurled her glass to the tiles. She was some time regaining composure. Logno retreated slowly, holding the tray almost as a Shield.\nSo Dama did more than sneak into power. Her Sisters consider her deadly. And so must I consider her.\n“Someone will pay for this wasted effort,” Dama said. Her smile was not pleasant.\nSomeone.\nSomeone made the wine. Someone made the dancing figure. Someone will pay. The identity was never important, only the pleasure or the need for retribution. Subservience.\n“Do not interrupt my thoughts,” Dama said. She went to the parapet and gazed at her Being Unknown, obviously recomposing her bargaining stance.\nOdrade turned her attention to Logno. What was that continued watchfulness, rapt attention fixed on Dama? No longer simple fear. Logno suddenly appeared supremely dangerous.\nPoison!\nOdrade knew it as certainly as though the aide had shouted the word.\nlam not Logno’s target. Not yet. She has taken this opportunity to make her bid for power.\nThere was no need to look at Dama. The moment of Spider Queen’s death was visible on Logno’s face. Turning, Odrade confirmed it. Dama lay in a heap under Being Unknown.\n“You will call me Great Honored Matre,” Logno said. “And you will learn to thank me for it. She (pointing at the red heap in the balcony corner) intended to betray you and exterminate your people. | have other plans. | am not one to destroy a useful weapon at the moment of our greatest need.”\nBattle? There’s always a desire for breathing space motivating it somewhere.\n—THE BASHAR TEG\nurbella watched the struggle for Junction with a\ndetachment that did not reflect her feelings. She stood with a coterie of Proctors in her no-ship’s command center, attention fixed on relay projections from groundside comeyes.\nThere were battles all around Junction—bursts of light on darkside, gray eruptions on dayside. A major engagement directed by Teg centered on “the Citadel”—a giant mound of Guild design with a new tower near its rim. Although Odrade’s vital-signs transmissions had stopped abruptly, her early reports confirmed that Great Honored Matre was in there.\nThe need to observe from a distance helped Murbella’s sense of detachment but she felt the excitement.\nInteresting times!\nThis ship contained precious cargo. The millions from Lampadas were being Shared and prepared for Scattering in a suite ordinarily reserved for Mother Superior. The wild Sister with her cargo of Memory dominated their priorities here.\nGolden Egg for sure!\nMurbella thought of the lives being risked in that suite. Preparing for the worst. No lack of volunteers and the threat in the Junction conflict minimized need for spice poison to ignite Sharings, reducing danger. Anyone on this ship could\nsense all-or-nothing in Odrade’s gamble. Imminent threat of death was recognized. Sharing necessary!\nTransformation of a Reverend Mother into sets of memories passed around at perilous cost among the Sisters no longer carried a mysterious aura for her, but Murbella still was awed by the responsibility. The courage of Rebecca...and Lucilla! ... demanded admiration.\nMillions of Memory Lives! All concentrated in what the Sisterhood called Extremis Progressiva, two by two then four by four and sixteen by sixteen, until each held all of them and any survivor could preserve the precious accumulation.\nWhat they were doing in Mother Superior’s suite had some of that flavor. The concept no longer terrified Murbella but it was not yet ordinary. Odrade’s words comforted.\n“Once you have fully accommodated to the bundles of Other Memory, all else falls into a perspective that is utterly familiar, as though you had known it always.”\nMurbella recognized that Teg was prepared to die in defense of this multiple awareness that was the Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit.\nCan | do less?\nTeg, no longer completely an enigma, remained an object of respect. Odrade Within amplified this with reminders of his exploits, then: “/ wonder how I’m doing down there? Ask.”\nComcommand said, “No word. But her transmissions may have been blocked by energy shielding.”\nThey knew who really asked the question. It was on their faces.\nShe has Odrade!\nMurbella again focused on the battle at the Citadel.\nHer own reactions surprised Murbella. Everything colored by historical disgust at repetition of war’s nonsense, but still this exuberant spirit reveling in newly acquired Bene Gesserit abilities.\nHonored Matre forces had good weapons down there, she noted, and Teg’s heat-absorption pads were taking punishment but even as she watched, the defensive perimeter collapsed. She could hear howling as a large Idaho-designed disrupter went bouncing down a passage between tall trees, Knocking out defenders right and left.\nOther Memory gave her a peculiar comparison. It was like a circus. Ships landing, disgorging their human cargoes.\n“In the center ring! The Spider Queen! Acts never before seen by the human eye!”\nOdrade’s persona produced a sense of amusement. How’s this for closeness of sisterhood?\nAre you dead down there, Dar? You must be. Spider Queen will blame you and be enraged.\nTrees placed long afternoon shadows across Teg’s lane of attack, she saw. Inviting cover. He ordered his people to go around. Ignore inviting avenues. Look for hard ways to approach and use them.\nThe Citadel lay in a gigantic botanical garden, strange trees and even stranger bushes mingled with prosaic plantings, all scattered around as though thrown there by a dancing child.\nMurbella found the circus metaphor attractive. It gave perspective to what she witnessed.\nAnnouncements in her mind.\nOver there, dancing animals, defenders of Spider Queen, all bound to obey! And in the first ring, the main event, supervised by our Ringmaster, Miles Teg! His people do mysterious things. Here is the talent!\nIt had aspects of a staged battle in the Roman Circus. Murbella appreciated the allusion. It made observation richer.\nBattle towers filled with armored soldiers approach. They engage. Flames cut the sky. Bodies fall.\nBut these were real bodies, real pains, real deaths. Bene Gesserit sensitivities forced her to regret the waste.\nIs this how it was for my parents caught in the sweep?\nMetaphors from Other Memory vanished. She saw Junction then as she knew Teg must see it. Bloody violence, familiar in memory and yet new. She saw attackers advancing, heard them.\nWoman’s voice, distinct with shock: “That bush screamed at me!”\nAnother voice, male: “No telling where some of this Originated. That sticky stuff burns your skin.”\nMurbella heard action on the far side of the Citadel but it grew eerily quiet around Teg’s position. She saw his troops flitting through shadows, closing in on the tower. There was Teg on Streggi’s shoulders. He took a moment to stare up at the façade confronting them about half a klick away. She chose a projection that looked where he looked. Motion behind windows there.\nWhere were the mysterious last-ditch weapons Honored Matres were supposed to possess?\nWhat will he do now?\nTeg had lost his Command Pod to a laser hit outside the main engagement area. The pod lay on its side behind him and he sat astride Streggi’s shoulders in a patch of screening bushes, some still smoldering. He had lost his comboard with the pod but retained the silvery horseshoe of his comlink, although it was crippled without the pod’s amplifiers. Communications specialists crouched nearby, jittering because they had lost close contact with the action.\nThe battle beyond the buildings grew louder. He heard hoarse shouts, the high hissing of burners and the lower buzz of large lasguns"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_c0fe10534948c966476d5f5c08acd126eb96f1deb9edc1d149faa04b32ca2ea0_v2"}
