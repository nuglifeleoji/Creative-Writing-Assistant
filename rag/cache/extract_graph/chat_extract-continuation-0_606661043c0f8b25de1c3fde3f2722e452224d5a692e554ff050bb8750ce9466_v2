Although he doesn’t really care to be called great.”\n“But were the Fremen...”\n“Were they right? My dearest Hwi, they were sensitive to the uses of power and they were greedy to maintain their ascendancy.”\n“I find this .. . disturbing, Lord.”\n“I can see that. You don’t like the idea that becoming a god could be that simple, as though anyone could do it.”\n“It sounds much too casual, Lord.” Her voice had a remote and testing quality.\n“| assure you that anyone could not do it.”\n“But you imply that you inherited your godhood from.. .”\n“Never suggest that to a Fish Speaker,” he said. “They react violently against heresy.”\nShe tried to swallow in a dry throat.\n“I say this only to protect you,” he said.\nHer voice was faint: “Thank you, Lord.”\n“My godhood began when | told my Fremen I no longer could give the death-water to the tribes. You know about the death-water?”\n“In the Dune days, the water recovered from the bodies of the dead,” she said.\n“Ahhh, you have read Noah Arkwright.”\nShe managed a faint smile.\n“I told my Fremen the water would be consecrated to a Supreme Deity, left nameless. Fremen were still allowed to control this water through my largesse.”\n“Water must have been very precious in those days.”\n“Very! And I, as delegate of this nameless deity, held loose control of that precious water for almost three hundred years.”\nShe chewed at her lower lip.\n“It still sounds calculating?” he asked.\nShe nodded.\n“It was. When it came time to consecrate my sister’s water, | performed a miracle. The voices of all the Atreides spoke from Ghani’s urn. Thus, my Fremen discovered that | was their Supreme Deity.”\nHwi spoke fearfully, her voice full of puzzled uncertainties at this revelation. “Lord, are you telling me that you are not really a god?”\n“|I am telling you that | do not play hide-and-seek with death.”\nShe stared at him for several minutes before responding in a way which assured him that she understood his deeper meaning. It was a reaction which only intensified her endearment to him.\n“Your death will not be like other deaths,” she said.\n“Precious Hwi,” he murmured.\n“| wonder that you do not fear the judgment of a true Supreme Deity,” she said.\n“Do you judge me, Hwi?”\n“No, but | fear for you.”\n“Think on the price | pay,” he said. “Every descendant part of me will carry some of my awareness locked away within it, lost and helpless.”\nShe put both hands over her mouth and stared at him.\n“This is the horror which my father could not face and which he tried to prevent: the infinite division and subdivision of a blind identity.”\nShe lowered her hands and whispered: “You will be conscious?”\n“Ina way... but mute. A little pearl of my awareness will go with every sandworm and every sandtrout—knowing yet unable to move a single cell, aware in an endless dream.”\nShe shuddered.\nLeto watched her try to understand such an existence. Could she imagine the final clamor when the subdivided bits of his identity grappled for a fading control of the Ixian machine which recorded his journals? Could she sense the wrenching silence which would follow that awful fragmentation?\n“Lord, they would use this knowledge against you were | to reveal it.”\n“Will you tell?”\n“Of course not!” She shook her head slowly from side to side. Why had he accepted this terrible transformation? Was there no escape?\nPresently, she said: “The machine which writes your thoughts, could it not be attuned to...”\n“To a million of me? To a billion? To more? My dear Hwi, none of those knowing-pearls will be truly me.”\nHer eyes filmed with tears. She blinked and inhaled a deep breath. Leto recognized the Bene Gesserit training in this, the way she accepted a flow of calmness.\n“Lord, you have made me terribly afraid.”\n“And you do not understand why | have done this.”\n“Is it possible for me to understand?”\n“Oh, yes. Many could understand it. What people do with understanding is another matter.”\n“Will you teach me what to do?”\n“You already know.”\nShe absorbed this silently, then: “It has something to do with your religion. | can feel it.”\nLeto smiled. “I can forgive your Ixian masters almost anything for the precious gift of you. Ask and you shall receive.”\nShe leaned toward him, rocking forward on her pillow. “Tell me about the inner workings of your religion.”\n“You will know all of me soon enough, Hwi. | promise it. Just remember that sun worship among our primitive ancestors was not far off the mark.”\n“Sun... worship?” She rocked backward.\n“That sun which controls all of the movement but which cannot be touched—that sun is death.”\n“Your... death?”\n“Any religion circles like a planet around a sun which it must use for its energy, upon which it depends for its very existence.”\nHer voice came barely above a whisper: “What do you see in your sun, Lord?”\n“A universe of many windows through which I may peer. Whatever the window frames, that is what | see.”\n“The future?”\n“The universe is timeless at its roots and contains therefore all times and all futures.”\n“It’s true then,” she said. “You saw a thing which this”— she gestured at his long, ribbed body—“ prevents.”\n“Do you find it in you to believe that this may be, in some small way, holy?” he asked.\nShe could only nod her head.\n“If you share it all with me,” he said, “I warn you that it will be a terrible burden.”\n“Will it make your burden lighter, Lord?”\n“Not lighter, but easier to accept.”\n“Then | will share. Tell me, Lord.”\n“Not yet, Hwi. You must be patient a while longer.”\nShe swallowed her disappointment, sighing.\n“It’s only that my Duncan Idaho grows impatient,” Leto said. “I must deal with him.”\nShe glanced backward, but the small room remained empty.\n“Do you wish me to leave now?”\n“I wish you would never leave me.”\nShe stared at him, noting the intensity of his regard, a hungry emptiness in his expression which filled her with sadness. “Lord, why do you tell me your secrets?”\n“I would not ask you to be the bride of a god.”\nHer eyes went wide with shock.\n“Do not answer,” he said.\nBarely moving her head, she sent her gaze along the Shadowy length of his body.\n“Do not search for parts of me which no longer exist,” he said. “Some forms of physical intimacy are no longer possible for me.”\nShe returned her attention to his cowled face, noting the pink skin of his cheeks, the intensely human effect of his features in that alien frame.\n“If you require children,” he said, “I would ask only that you let me choose the father. But | have not yet asked you anything.”\nHer voice was faint. “Lord, | do not know what to...”\n“I will return to the Citadel soon,” he said. “You will come to me there and we will talk. | will tell you then about the thing which | prevent.”\n“lam frightened, Lord, more frightened than I ever imagined | could be.”\n“Do not fear me. | can be nothing but gentle with my gentle Hwi. As for other dangers, my Fish Speakers will Shield you with their own bodies. They dare not let harm come to you!”\nHwi lifted herself to her feet and stood trembling.\nLeto saw how deeply his words had affected her and he felt the pain of it. Hwi’s eyes glistened with tears. She clasped her hands tightly to still the trembling. He knew she would come to him willingly at the Citadel. No matter what he asked, her response would be the response of his Fish Speakers:\n“Yes, Lord.”\nIt came to Leto that if she could change places with him, take up his burden, she would offer herself. The fact that she could not do this added to her pain. She was intelligence built on profound sensitivity, without any of Malky’s hedonistic weaknesses. She was frightening in her perfection. Everything about her reaffirmed his awareness that she was precisely the kind of woman who, if he had grown to normal manhood, he would have wanted (No! Demanded!) as his mate.\nAnd the Ixians knew it.\n“Leave me now,” he whispered.\nI am both father and mother to my people. | have known the ecstasy of birth and the ecstasy of death and | know the patterns that you must learn. Have | not wandered intoxicated through the universe of shapes? Yes! | have seen you outlined in light. That universe which you say you see and feel, that universe is my dream. My energies focus upon it and | am in any realm and every realm. Thus, you are born.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nll y Fish Speakers tell me that you went to the Citadel immediately after Siaynoq,” Leto said.\nHe stared accusingly at Idaho, who stood near where Hwi had sat only an hour ago. Such a small passage of time—yet Leto felt the emptiness as centuries.\n“| needed time to think,” Idaho said. He looked into the shadowy pit where Leto’s cart rested.\n“And to talk to Siona?”\n“Yes.” Idaho lifted his gaze to Leto’s face.\n“But you asked for Moneo,” Leto said.\n“Do they report on every movement | make?” Idaho demanded.\n“Not every movement.”\n“Sometimes people need to be alone.”\n“Of course. But do not blame the Fish Speakers for being concerned about you.”\n“Siona says she is to be tested!”\n“Was that why you asked for Moneo?”\n“What is this test?”\n“Moneo knows. | presumed that was why you wanted to see him.”\n“You presume nothing! You know.”\n“Siaynog has upset you, Duncan. | am sorry.”\n“Do you have any idea what it’s like to be me... here?”\n“The ghola’s lot is not easy,” Leto said. “Some lives are harder than others.”\n“| don’t need any juvenile philosophy!”\n“What do you need, Duncan?”\n“| need to know some things.”\n“Such as?”\n“| don’t understand any of these people around you! Without showing any surprise about it, Moneo tells me that Siona was part of a rebellion against you. His own daughter!”\n“In his day, Moneo too was a rebel.”\n“See what | mean? Did you test him, too?”\n“Yes.”\n“Will you test me?”\n“I am testing you.”\nIdaho glared at him, then: “I don’t understand your government, your Empire, anything. The more | find out, the more | realize that | don’t know what’s going on.”\n“How fortunate that you have discovered the way of wisdom,” Leto said.\n“What?” Idaho’s baffled outrage raised his voice to a battlefield roar which filled the small room.\nLeto smiled. “Duncan, have | not told you that when you think you know something, that is a most perfect barrier against learning?”\n“Then tell me what’s going on.”\n“My friend Duncan Idaho is acquiring a new habit. He is learning always to look beyond what he thinks he knows.”\n“All right, all right.”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sisterhood is a group mentioned in the context of being coldly calculating, possibly referring to the Bene Gesserit, a powerful and secretive organization in the Dune universe>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are a desert-dwelling people who deified Muad'Dib and played a significant role in the politics and religion of the Dune universe>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MUAD'DIB<|>PERSON<|>Muad'Dib, also known as Paul Atreides, is a central figure in the Dune saga, revered as a messiah by the Fremen>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HWI<|>PERSON<|>Hwi is a character engaged in deep conversation with Leto II, showing concern and fear about his revelations and his godhood>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto II's all-female military and religious order, fiercely loyal to him and tasked with protecting his interests>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LETO II<|>PERSON<|>Leto II, the God Emperor, is a hybrid of human and sandworm, ruling the universe for millennia and possessing prescient abilities>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune, also known as Arrakis, is a desert planet central to the Dune saga, famous for its spice melange>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GHANI<|>PERSON<|>Ghani is Leto II's sister, whose death and consecration of her water played a role in his ascension to godhood>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atreides are a noble family in the Dune universe, with Leto II and Paul Atreides being key figures>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IXIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ixians are a technologically advanced society in the Dune universe, known for their machines and innovations>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a recurring ghola (clone) in the Dune series, serving as a loyal companion and sometimes rebel against Leto II>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIONA<|>PERSON<|>Siona is a rebel against Leto II and the daughter of Moneo, undergoing tests to determine her role in the future>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MONEO<|>PERSON<|>Moneo is Leto II's majordomo and a former rebel, now serving the God Emperor loyally>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>GEO<|>The Citadel is a significant location where Leto II resides and conducts important meetings>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIAYNOQ<|>EVENT<|>Siaynoq is a religious ceremony or event mentioned in the context of Leto II's rule>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>MUAD'DIB<|>The Fremen deified Muad'Dib and played a key role in his rise to power<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>HWI<|>Leto II shares deep secrets and plans with Hwi, showing a profound connection<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>FISH SPEAKERS<|>The Fish Speakers are Leto II's loyal military and religious order<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>Duncan Idaho is a recurring companion and sometimes adversary to Leto II<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>SIONA<|>Siona is a rebel being tested by Leto II for her role in the future<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>MONEO<|>Moneo serves as Leto II's majordomo and trusted advisor<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>SIONA<|>Duncan Idaho interacts with Siona, discussing her test and rebellion<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MONEO<|>SIONA<|>Moneo is Siona's father and a former rebel himself<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IXIANS<|>HWI<|>Hwi is a gift from the Ixians, designed to appeal to Leto II<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>ATREIDES<|>Leto II is a descendant of the Atreides family<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>GHANI<|>Ghani is Leto II's sister, whose death played a role in his godhood<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>DUNE<|>Dune is the planet where Leto II's ancestors, the Atreides, rose to power<|>7>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
