They are a hybrid of human and beast, exhibiting ferocity and cat-like traits, and are often associated with the enigmatic **Ones of Many Faces**. Their creation is attributed to an unknown group, possibly a **Tleilaxu offshoot**, though some speculate they were designed by the **Handlers**, human-like companions who control and accompany them.  \n\nInitially kept by the **Honored Matres** as wild, barely tamed animals, Futars are resistant to breeding and direct commands, requiring specialized handlers for control. Despite their origins with the Honored Matres, they later become adversaries, engineered specifically to hunt and kill them. This shift positions them as potential allies of the **Bene Gesserit** in their conflict against the Honored Matres.  \n\nFutars are described as dangerous and unpredictable, capable of speech and terrifying behavior, leading some to view them as biological weapons. **Dama**, a prominent Honored Matre, reportedly used them, though their deployment required careful handling. **Murbella**, a key figure in the later conflicts, brought Futars to attract Handlers, further underscoring their strategic importance.  \n\nReferences to Futars appear in **Duncan Idaho’s weapon scroll visions**, suggesting a possible link to Honored Matre technology or deeper genetic manipulation. While sometimes dismissed as insignificant—such as when kept in security cells aboard a ship—their role in the broader conflict highlights their latent threat and utility.  \n\nIn summary, Futars are mysterious, genetically engineered beings with a complex relationship to multiple factions. Created for uncertain purposes, they transition from tools of the Honored Matres to hunters of them, all while maintaining a precarious alliance with the Bene Gesserit. Their origins, handlers, and ultimate fate remain shrouded in mystery, but their ferocity and strategic value ensure their enduring significance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251861, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 483, "total_tokens": 881, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 419}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
