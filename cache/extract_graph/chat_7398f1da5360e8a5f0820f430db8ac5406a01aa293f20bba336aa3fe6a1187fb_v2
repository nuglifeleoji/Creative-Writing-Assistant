And he can fight either hand; look out for a knife shift.”\nBut strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was training and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after day, hour after hour on the practice floor.\nGurney Halleck’s words were there to remember: “The good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearing-guard simultaneously. The point can also cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent’s blade.”\nPaul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not even know if it could be broken.\nJamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.\nPaul crouched, realizing then that he had no Shield, but was trained to fighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness necessary for penetrating the enemy's shield. In spite of constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shield’s mindless blunting of attack speed, he knew that shield- awareness was part of him.\nJamis called out in ritual challenge: “May thy knife chip and shatter!”\nThis knife will break then, Paul thought.\nHe cautioned himself that Jamis also was without Shield, but the man wasn’t trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.\nPaul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man’s body looked like knotted whipcord on a dried Skeleton. His crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes.\nFear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull yellow light within this ring of people. Prescience had fed his knowledge with countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the strings of decision that guided them, but this was the rea/-now. This was death hanging on an infinite number of minuscule mischances.\nAnything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the troop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in a glowglobe’s brilliance, a deceptive shadow.\nl'm afraid, Paul told himself.\nAnd he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating Silently to himself the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. “Fear is the mind-killer....” It was a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready.\n“I'll sheath my knife in your blood,” Jamis snarled. And in the middle of the last word he pounced.\nJessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.\nWhere the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.\nNow, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind.\nPaul’s motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis the margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.\nPaul withdrew, crouching low. “First, you must find my blood,” he said.\nJessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came over her what a two-edged thing that was. The boy’s reactions were those of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen. But the attack was trained, too, and conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier. A shield would repel too fast a blow, admit only the Slowly deceptive counter. It needed control and trickery to get through a shield.\nDoes Paul see it? she asked herself. He must!\nAgain Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes.\nAnd again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nEach time, Paul’s counterblow came an instant late.\nAnd Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul’s defensive reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis’ blow.\n“Is your son playing with that poor fool?” Stilgar asked. He waved her to silence before she could respond. “Sorry; you must remain silent.”\nNow the two figures on the rock floor circled each other: Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low.\nAgain, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had been dodging.\nInstead of faking back and out, Paul met the man’s knife hand on the point of his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left and thankful for Chani’s warning.\nJamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand. Blood dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His eyes were wide and staring— two blue-black holes—studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes.\n“Ah, that one hurt,” Stilgar murmured.\nPaul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first blood, called out: “Do you yield?”\n“Hah!” Jamis cried.\nAn angry murmur arose from the troop.\n“Hold!” Stilgar called out. “The lad doesn’t know our rule.” Then, to Paul: “There can be no yielding in the tahaddi-challenge. Death is the test of it.”\nJessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: He’s never killed a man like this...in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?\nPaul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis’ movement. The prescient knowledge of the time- boiling variables in this cave came back to plague him now. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself.\nVariable piled on variable—that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in his path. It was like a gigantic rock in the flood, creating maelstroms in the Current around it.\n“Have an end to it, lad,” Stilgar muttered. “Don’t play with him.”\nPaul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.\nJamis backed now that the realization swept over him—that this was no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen crysknife.\nJessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man’s face. Now is when he’s most dangerous, she thought. Now he’s desperate and can do anything. He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.\nAnd she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis— an emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate\nperil to her son.\nJamis could do anything...any unpredictable thing, she told herself. She wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this experience. But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles. And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Paul’s gift.\nPaul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho’s voice flowed through Paul’s awareness: “When your opponent fears you, then’s the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them.”\nThe crowd in the cavern began to mutter.\nThey think Paul’s toying with Jamis, Jessica thought. They think Paul’s being needlessly cruel.\nBut she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of the spectacle. And she could see the pressure building up in Jamis. The moment when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to Jamis...or to Paul.\nJamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the hand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.\nJessica gasped.\nBut Paul had been warned by Chani: “Jamis fights with either hand.” And the depth of his training had taken in that trick en passant. “Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it,” Gurney Halleck had told him time and again. “The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand.”\nAnd Paul had seen Jamis’ mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to confuse Paul and hide the knife shift.\nExcept for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the staring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor. Shields didn’t count where the body’s own movement could be used against it. Paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis’ chest was descending—then away to watch the man crumble.\nJamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass.\n“Killing with the point lacks artistry,” |\\daho had once told Paul, “but don’t let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself.”\nThe troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.\nAnd there was no body on the rock floor.\nJessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a Sea of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.\nNow is the terrible moment, she thought. He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.\nShe forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space where two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into his stillsuit.\nJessica stared at her son. Paul’s eyes were bright. He breathed heavily, permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.\n“Him against Jamis and not a mark on him,” one of the men muttered.\nChani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl’s excitement, the admiration in the elfin face.\nIt must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thought.\nShe compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: “Well-I-l, now—how does it feel to be a killer?”\nPaul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother’s cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.\nStilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: “When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.”\nJessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made—it served a purpose now.
