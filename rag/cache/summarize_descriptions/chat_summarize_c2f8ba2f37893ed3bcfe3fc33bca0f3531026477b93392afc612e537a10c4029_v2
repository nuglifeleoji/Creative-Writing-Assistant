Their union is not merely strategic—Leto harbors deep emotional feelings for Hwi, finding in her both comfort and a challenge to his usual detachment.  \n\nThough Hwi’s exact role is not always explicitly defined, she is clearly central to Leto’s plans, both as a romantic partner and a key figure in his broader designs.
