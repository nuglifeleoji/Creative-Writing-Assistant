Alia wouldn’t let him live long if she caught him, but there was always Stilgar—a good Fremen with a good Fremen’s superstitions.\nJessica had explained it: “There’s a very thin layer of civilized behavior over Stilgar’s original nature. And here’s how you take that layer off him...”\nThe spirit of Muad’Dib is more than words, more than the letter of the Law which arises in his name. Muad’Dib must always be that inner outrage against the complacently powerful, against the charlatans and the dogmatic fanatics. It is that inner outrage which must have its say because Muad’Dib taught us one thing above all others: that humans can endure only in a fraternity of social justice.\n—THE FEDAYKIN COMPACT\nBes sat with his back against the wall of the hut, his attention on Sabiha, watching the threads of his vision unroll. She had prepared the coffee and set it aside. Now she squatted across from him stirring his evening meal. It was a gruel redolent with melange. Her hands moved quickly with the ladle and liquid indigo stained the sides of his bowl. She bent her thin face over the bowl, blending in the concentrate. The crude membrane which made a stilltent of the hut had been patched with lighter material directly behind her, and this formed a grey halo against which her shadow danced in the flickering light of the cooking flame and the single lamp.\nThat lamp intrigued Leto. These people of Shuloch were profligate with spice-oil: a lamp, not a glowglobe. They kept Slave outcasts within their walls in the fashion told by the most ancient Fremen traditions. Yet they employed ornithopters and the latest spice harvesters. They were a crude mixture of ancient and modern.\nSabiha pushed the bowl of gruel toward him, extinguished the cooking flame.\nLeto ignored the bowl.\n“I will be punished if you do not eat this,” she said.\nHe stared at her, thinking: /f/ kill her, that'll shatter one vision. If | tell her Muriz’s plans, that'll shatter another vision. If | wait here for my father, this vision-thread will become a mighty rope.\nHis mind sorted the threads. Some held a sweetness which haunted him. One future with Sabiha carried alluring reality within his prescient awareness. It threatened to block out all others until he followed it out to its ending agonies.\n“Why do you stare at me that way?” she asked.\nStill he did not answer.\nShe pushed the bowl closer to him.\nLeto tried to swallow in a dry throat. The impulse to kill Sabiha welled in him. He found himself trembling with it. How easy it would be to shatter one vision and let the wildness run free!\n“Muriz commands this,” she said, touching the bowl.\nYes, Muriz commanded it. Superstition conquered everything. Muriz wanted a vision cast for him to read. He was an ancient savage asking the witch doctor to throw the ox bones and interpret their sprawl. Muriz had taken his Captive’s stillsuit “as a simple precaution.” There’d been a Sly jibe at Namri and Sabiha in that comment. Only fools let a prisoner escape.\nMuriz had a deep emotional problem, though: the Spirit River. The captive’s water flowed in Muriz’s veins. Muriz sought a sign that would permit him to hold a threat of death over Leto.\nLike father, like son, Leto thought.\n“The spice will only give you visions,” Sabiha said. The long silences made her uneasy. “I’ve had visions in the orgy many times. They don’t mean anything.”\nThat’s it! he thought, his body locking itself into a stillness which left his skin cold and clammy. The Bene Gesserit training took over his consciousness, a pinpoint illumination which fanned out beyond him to throw the\nblazoning light of vision upon Sabiha and all of her Cast Out fellows. The ancient Bene Gesserit learning was explicit:\n“Languages build up to reflect specializations in a way of life. Each specialization may be recognized by its words, by its assumptions and sentence structures. Look for stoppages. Specializations represent places where life is being stopped, where the movement is dammed up and frozen.” He saw Sabiha then as a vision-maker in her own right, and every other human carried the same power. Yet she was disdainful of her spice-orgy visions. They caused disquiet and, therefore, must be put aside, forgotten deliberately. Her people prayed to Shai-Hulud because the worm dominated many of their visions. They prayed for dew at the desert’s edge because moisture limited their lives. Yet they wallowed in spice wealth and lured sandtrout to open qanats. Sabiha fed him prescient visions with a casual callousness, yet within her words he saw the illuminated signals: she depended upon absolutes, sought finite limits, and all because she couldn’t handle the rigors of terrible decisions which touched her own flesh. She clung to her one-eyed vision of the universe, englobing and time- freezing as it might be, because the alternatives terrified her.\nIn contrast, Leto felt the pure movement of himself. He was a membrane collecting infinite dimensions and, because he saw those dimensions, he could make the terrible decisions.\nAs my father did.\n“You must eat this!” Sabiha said, her voice petulant.\nLeto saw the whole pattern of the visions now and knew the thread he must follow. My skin is not my own. He stood, pulling his robe around him. It felt strange against his flesh with no stillsuit protecting his body. His feet were bare upon the fused spice-fabric of the floor, feeling the sand tracked in there.\n“What're you doing?” Sabiha demanded.\n“The air is bad in here. I’m going outside.”\n“You can’t escape,” she said. “Every canyon has its worm. If you go beyond the qanat, the worms will sense you by your moisture. These captive worms are very alert—not like the ones in the desert at all. Besides—” How gloating her voice became! “—you’ve no stillsuit.”\n“Then why do you worry?” he asked, wondering if he might yet provoke a real reaction from her.\n“Because you've not eaten.”\n“And you'll be punished.”\n“Yes!”\n“But I’m already saturated with spice,” he said. “Every moment is a vision.” He gestured with a bare foot at the bowl. “Pour that onto the sand. Who'll know?”\n“They watch,” she whispered.\nHe shook his head, shedding her from his visions, feeling new freedom envelop him. No need to kill this poor pawn. She danced to other music, not even knowing the steps, believing that she might yet share the power which lured the hungry pirates of Shuloch and Jacurutu. Leto went to the doorseal, put a hand upon it.\n“When Muriz comes,” she said, “he'll be very angry with\n”\n“Muriz is a merchant of emptiness,” Leto said. “My aunt has drained him.”\nShe got to her feet. “I’m going out with you.”\nAnd he thought: She remembers how | escaped her. Now she feels the fragility of her hold upon me. Her visions stir within her. But she would not listen to those visions. She had but to reflect: How could he outwit a captive worm in its narrow canyon? How could he live in the Tanzerouft without stillsuit or Fremkit?\n“I must be alone to consult my visions,” he said. “You'll remain here.”\n“Where will you go?”\n“To the qanat.”\n“The sandtrout come out in swarms at night.”\n“They won't eat me.”\n“Sometimes the worm comes down to just beyond the water,” she said. “If you cross the qanat.. .” She broke off, trying to edge her words with menace.\n“How could | mount a worm without hooks?” he asked, wondering if she still could salvage some bit of her visions.\n“Will you eat when you return?” she asked, squatting once more by the bowl, recovering the ladle and stirring the indigo broth.\n“Everything in its own time,” he said, knowing she’d be unable to detect his delicate use of Voice, the way he insinuated his own desires into her decision-making.\n“Muriz will come and see if you’ve had a vision,” she warned.\n“I will deal with Muriz in my own way,” he said, noting how heavy and slow her movements had become. The pattern of all Fremen lent itself naturally into the way he guided her now. Fremen were people of extraordinary energy at sunrise but a deep and lethargic melancholy often overcame them at nightfall. Already she wanted to sink into sleep and dreams.\nLeto let himself out into the night alone.\nThe sky glittered with stars and he could make out the bulk of surrounding buttes against their pattern. He went up under the palms to the qanat.\nFor a long time Leto squatted at the qanat’s edge, listening to the restless hiss of sand within the canyon beyond. A small worm by the sound of it; chosen for that reason, no doubt. A small worm would be easier to transport. He thought about the worm’s capture: the hunters would dull it with a water mist, using the traditional Fremen method of taking a worm for the orgy/transformation rite. But this worm would not be killed by immersion. This one would go out on a Guild heighliner to some hopeful buyer whose desert probably would be too\nmoist. Few off-worlders realized the basic desiccation which the sandtrout had maintained on Arrakis. Had maintained. Because even here in the Tanzerouft there would be many times more airborne moisture than any worm had ever before known short of its death in a Fremen cistern.\nHe heard Sabiha stirring in the hut behind him. She was restless, prodded by her own suppressed visions. He wondered how it would be to live outside a vision with her, Sharing each moment just as it came, of itself. The thought attracted him far more strongly than had any spice vision. There was a certain cleanliness about facing an unknown future.\n“A kiss in the sietch is worth two in the city.”\nThe old Fremen maxim said it all. The traditional sietch had held a recognizable wildness mingled with shyness. There were traces of that shyness in the people of Jacurutu/Shuloch, but only traces. This saddened him by revealing what had been lost.\nSlowly, so slowly that the knowledge was fully upon him before he recognized its beginnings, Leto grew aware of the soft rustling of many creatures all around him.\nSanatrout.\nSoon it would be time to shift from one vision to another. He felt the movement of sandtrout as a movement within himself. Fremen had lived with the strange creatures for generations, knowing that if you risked a bit of water as bait, you could lure them into reach. Many a Fremen dying of thirst had risked his last few drops of water in this gamble, knowing that the sweet green syrup teased from a sandtrout might yield a small profit in energy. But the sandtrout were mostly the game of children who caught them for the Huanui. And for play.\nLeto shuddered at the thought of what that play meant to him now.\nHe felt one of the creatures slither across his bare foot. It hesitated, then went on, attracted by the greater amount of\nwater in the qanat.\nFor a moment, though, he’d felt the reality of his terrible decision. The sandtrout\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a dangerous figure who would not let someone live long if she caught them, indicating her power and ruthlessness in the narrative.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen with deep-rooted superstitions and a thin layer of civilized behavior over his original nature, as described by Jessica.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a character who provides insight into Stilgar's nature, indicating her role as an observer and explainer within the story.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUAD’DIB<|>PERSON<|>Muad’Dib is a spiritual and ideological figure whose teachings emphasize social justice and inner outrage against oppressive powers.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE FEDAYKIN COMPACT<|>EVENT<|>The Fedaykin Compact represents a significant agreement or set of principles derived from Muad’Dib's teachings, focusing on social justice and human endurance.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BES<|>PERSON<|>Bes is a character who observes Sabiha and engages with her, showing his involvement in the unfolding events and his connection to the visions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SABIHA<|>PERSON<|>Sabiha is a woman preparing food for Bes, involved in the visions and the events surrounding Leto, showing her role as a caretaker and participant in the narrative.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is a central figure experiencing visions and making critical decisions, showing his deep connection to the events and his prescient abilities.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHULOCH<|>GEO<|>Shuloch is a place where people live with a mix of ancient and modern traditions, including the use of ornithopters and spice harvesters.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACURUTU<|>GEO<|>Jacurutu is another location mentioned in connection with Shuloch, indicating a shared cultural and geographical context.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TANZEROUFT<|>GEO<|>The Tanzerouft is a desert area where the events involving Leto and the sandtrout take place, highlighting its harsh and unforgiving nature.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MURIZ<|>PERSON<|>Muriz is a character who commands actions and seeks visions, showing his authority and his emotional struggles, particularly with the Spirit River.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAMRI<|>PERSON<|>Namri is mentioned in passing as someone connected to the events involving Leto and Sabiha, indicating his role in the broader narrative.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is an organization with deep knowledge and training, influencing characters like Leto and providing insights into human behavior and language.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAI-HULUD<|>PERSON<|>Shai-Hulud is a revered figure or deity in Fremen culture, associated with the worms and their dominance in visions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SPIRIT RIVER<|>EVENT<|>The Spirit River is a significant emotional and possibly spiritual concept for Muriz, affecting his decisions and actions.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIA<|>STILGAR<|>Alia's potential threat to Stilgar's life indicates a tense relationship between them, driven by power dynamics and survival.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>STILGAR<|>Jessica provides a detailed explanation of Stilgar's nature, showing her understanding and influence over him.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUAD’DIB<|>THE FEDAYKIN COMPACT<|>Muad’Dib's teachings form the foundation of the Fedaykin Compact, linking his ideology to the event.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BES<|>SABIHA<|>Bes observes and interacts with Sabiha, indicating their close and possibly dependent relationship.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>SABIHA<|>Leto interacts with Sabiha, considering her role in his visions and decisions, showing their complex connection.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>MURIZ<|>Leto and Muriz are in a power struggle, with Muriz commanding actions and Leto resisting, indicating a tense relationship.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Leto's training and decisions are influenced by Bene Gesserit teachings, showing their impact on his character.<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SABIHA<|>MURIZ<|>Sabiha follows Muriz's commands, indicating her subservience and his authority over her.<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MURIZ<|>THE SPIRIT RIVER<|>Muriz's emotional struggles are tied to the Spirit River, showing its significance in his life.<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHULOCH<|>JACURUTU<|>Shuloch and Jacurutu are connected locations with shared cultural and geographical traits.<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>TANZEROUFT<|>Leto's experiences and decisions are deeply tied to the Tanzerouft desert, highlighting its importance in his journey.<|>8\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
