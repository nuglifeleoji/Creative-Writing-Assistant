刘锋道：“刚刚你第二次打开召唤之门的时候，轩宇因为给你挡火球，撞在了召唤之门上，然后那时候我好像感觉到有些恍惚，就是那一瞬，你的召唤之门好像有了变化的。”\n\n    钱磊扭头看向蓝轩宇，“是这样吗？”\n\n    蓝轩宇有些惊讶，刘锋的战斗力虽然有些不靠谱，这洞察力却是不错啊！\n\n    “好像是有了点变化。”蓝轩宇点点头道。\n\n    钱磊道：“那我们要不要再试试？”一边说着，他抛了抛手中的斗罗币。\n\n    “好。”蓝轩宇和刘锋同时点头。他们对于先前的情况也是非常好奇。这召唤之门和蓝轩宇联合在一起，就会出现变化？\n\n    于是，他们再一次申请了初级考核。\n\n    光芒一闪，还是斗兽场。这倒是简单，场景和先前一模一样，就连战斗对象都一样。\n\n    钱磊毫不犹豫的第一时间抛出了自己的召唤之门，蓝轩宇银纹蓝银草覆盖左手，抓住门框。\n\n    果然，和先前一模一样的感觉出现了，时间仿佛凝滞了一瞬，蓝轩宇明显感觉到自己和另一边有了些微的联系。\n\n    斗兽场四周的闸门开启，熔岩犬蜂拥而入。\n\n    那娇小纤细的身影也就在这时，从召唤之门中走了出来，可不正是先前的深蓝色长发少女么？\n\n    四人面面相觑，少女一脸疑惑的道：“又是你们？你们有病吧，干嘛又把我弄过来？”\n\n    “哈哈、哇哈哈哈！”钱磊却是突然大笑起来，吓了其他三人一跳。\n\n    “钱串子你笑什么？”刘锋没好气的踹了他一脚。\n\n    “靠谱，靠谱了啊！我的召唤终于靠谱了啊！你们知不知道，这是我第一次连续两次召唤来同样的存在，哇哈哈，靠谱了真的是太好了哇！”钱磊兴奋的手舞足蹈。\n\n    “到底是怎么回事啊？”少女疑惑的道。\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“先对付这些熔岩犬吧，我们给你解释。”\n\n    少女心中一动，道：“你还用你那草缠绕在我身上。”\n\n    蓝轩宇一愣，但却依言释放银纹蓝银草，近距离缠绕在少女腰间。\n\n    少女顿时感觉到一股清冷传遍全身，自己体内的魂力明显变得厚重了许多，右手虚空一招，深蓝色的冰枪已经出现在掌握之中，一枪横扫，深蓝色冰环顿时呈扇形向周围散开，大片的熔岩犬化为冰雕跌落。\n\n    当三头百年熔岩犬出现的时候，十年熔岩犬已经被她清扫一空了。\n\n    “这、这是二环的实力？”钱磊和刘锋都有些目瞪口呆。\n\n
