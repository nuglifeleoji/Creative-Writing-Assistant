\n　　田福堂也清楚地知道，金俊斌不好往土里埋！金家兄弟不会轻易地让他田福堂下这个台阶。因此，当他派人告诉金俊山让他和玉亭处理这事后，马上又想到，这两个人恐怕处理不了，事情归根结底还要他田福堂出面。可他现在脑子乱糟糟的，身体又有病，也急忙不知该怎办，所以就让老婆先把孙玉亭叫来商量一下。 \n　　玉亭几乎是小跑着进了书记的家门。田福堂的老婆走得慢，现在还在路上没回来。 \n　　玉亭一进门，先关切地问田福堂：“病得不要紧吧？”田福堂欠起身子，咳嗽了一阵，说：“大概不要紧。”他爬起来，把衫子穿上，坐在被窝里，给嘴里塞了两片药，喝了一口温开水。 \n　　“事情发生了，你也不要着急。毛主席说，要革命，死人的事经常发生哩……”孙玉亭安慰他说。 \n　　田福堂失去光彩的眼睛茫然地望着对面墙，说：“我估计俊斌不好往土里埋……” \n　　“怎？”孙玉亭瞪大眼睛望着书记，不明白他的意思。“金俊武弟兄们又不是些傻瓜，俊斌是为集体牺牲了的，因此队里不说下个什么，恐怕他们不会轻易了结这件事。”“棺材、衣服，埋人时吃的喝的，队里都负责上，还要怎样哩？”玉亭说。 \n　　“不在这些事上。这些事理所当然要队里管。我说的是其它方面……玉亭，你再想想，看还有什么可以弥补的？”孙玉亭基本明白了书记的意思。他想了一会，说：“这样吧，咱们首先要在政治上对待好这件事。金俊斌同志为了集体的革命事业，献出了自己的生命，咱们要追认他为革命烈士。叫人打一块墓碑，上面写上‘金俊斌烈士之墓’。另外，咱们再开个隆重的追悼会。毛主席在《为人民服务》这篇文章中说过，今后村里死了人，就开个追悼会……”“你说的这些都好。光这恐怕还不行……” \n　　田福堂还没说完，他老婆就引着金俊山和金俊武进了家门——福堂的老婆半路上碰见这两个人，就一起相跟着回来了。 \n　　田福堂一看这两个人来找他，就明白是什么意思了——他们的到来他早就估计到了。 \n　　福堂客气地让这两个领导人坐下。他老婆赶紧给这几个人倒茶递烟。 \n　　玉亭接过福堂老婆递上的纸烟，没慌着点，别在自己的耳朵上，说：“福堂气管有病，不能闻烟味。” \n　　金俊山正准备点烟，听孙玉亭这么一说，也就不好意思再吸了。 \n　　田福堂无所谓地说：“不\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田福堂<|>PERSON<|>田福堂 is a key figure involved in the
