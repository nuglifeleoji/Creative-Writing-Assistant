Like breathing ... or heartbeats. A flaw? The Sisterhood is wrong!\n“Wash my back,” she said and laughed when the shower drenched his clothing. She helped him undress and there in the shower it happened once more: this uncontrollable compulsion, this male-female mingling that drove away everything except sensation. Only afterward could she remember and say to herself: He knows every technique |\ndo. But it was more than technique. He wants to please me! Dear Gods of Dur! How was I ever this fortunate?\nShe clung to his neck while he carried her out of the shower and dropped her still wet onto her bed. She pulled him down beside her and they lay there quietly, letting their energies rebuild.\nPresently, she whispered: “So the Missionaria will use Sheeana.”\n“Very dangerous.”\n“Puts the Sisterhood in an exposed position. | thought they always tried to avoid that.”\n“From my point of view, it’s ludicrous.”\n“Because they intended you to control Sheeana?”\n“No one can control her! Perhaps no one should.” He looked up at the comeyes. “Hey, Bell! You have more than one tiger by the tail.”\nBellonda, returning to Archives, stopped at the door of Comeye-Recording and looked a question at the Watch Mother.\n“In the shower again,” the Watch Mother said. “It gets boring after a while.”\n“Participation Mystique!” Bellonda said and strode off to her quarters, her mind roiling with changed perceptions that needed reorganizing. He’s a better Mentat than | am!\nI’m jealous of Sheeana, damn her! And he knows it!\nParticipation Mystique! The orgy as energizer. Honored Matre sexual knowledge was having an effect on the Bene Gesserit akin to that primitive submersion in shared ecstasy. We take one step toward it and one step away.\nJust knowing this thing exists! How repellent, how dangerous... and yet, how magnetic.\nAnd Sheeana is immune! Damn her! Why did Idaho have to remind them of that just now?\nGive me the judgment of balanced minds in preference to laws every time. Codes and manuals create patterned behavior. All patterned behavior tends to go unquestioned, gathering destructive momentum.\n—DARWI ODRADE\namalane appeared in Odrade’s quarters at Eldio just before dawn, bringing news about the glazeway ahead of them.\n“Drifting sand has made the road dangerous or impassable in six places beyond the sea. Very large dunes.”\nOdrade had just completed her daily regimen: mini-Agony of spice followed by exercise and cold shower. Eldio’s guest sleeping cell had only one slingchair (they knew her preferences) and she had seated herself to await Streggi and the morning report.\nTamalane’s face appeared sallow in the light of two silvery glowglobes but there was no mistaking her satisfaction. /f you had listened to me in the first place!\n“Get us ‘thopters,” Odrade said.\nTamalane left, obviously disappointed at Mother Superior’s mild reaction.\nOdrade summoned Streggi. “Check alternate roads. Find out about passage around the sea’s western end.”\nStreggi hurried away, almost colliding with Tamalane who was returning.\n“I regret to inform you that Transport cannot give us enough ‘thopters immediately. They are relocating five communities east of us. We probably can have them by noon.”\n“Isn't there an observation terminal at the edge of that desert spur south of us?” Odrade asked.\n“The first obstruction is just beyond it.” Tamalane still was too pleased with herself.\n“Have the ‘thopters meet us there,” Odrade said. “We will leave immediately after breakfast.”\n“But Dar...”\n“Tell Clairby you are riding with me today. Yes, Streggi?” The acolyte stood in the doorway behind Tamalane.\nThe set of her shoulders as she left said Tamalane did not take the new seating arrangements as forgiveness. On the coals! But Tam’s behavior fitted itself to their need.\n“We can get to the observation terminal,” Streggi said, indicating she had heard. “We'll stir up dust and sand but it’s safe.”\n“Let’s hurry breakfast.”\nThe closer they came to the desert, the more barren the country, and Odrade commented on this as they sped south.\nWithin one hundred klicks of the last reported desert fringe, they saw signs of communities uprooted and removed to colder latitudes. Bare foundations, unsalvageable walls damaged in dismantling and left behind. Pipes cut off at foundation level. Too expensive to dig them out. Sand would cover all of this unsightly mess before long.\nThey had no Shield Wall here as there had been on Dune, Odrade observed to Streggi. Someday soon, the population of Chapterhouse would remove itself to polar regions and mine the ice for water.\n“Is it true, Mother Superior,” someone in back with Tamalane asked, “that we’re already making spice- harvesting equipment?”\nOdrade turned in her seat. The question had come from a Communications clerk, senior acolyte: an older woman with responsibility wrinkles deep in her forehead; dark and squinty from long hours at her equipment.\n“We must be ready for the worms,” Odrade said.\n“If they come,” Tamalane said.\n“Have you ever walked on the desert, Tam?” Odrade asked.\n“I was on Dune.” Very short answer.\n“But did you go out into open desert?”\n“Only to some small drifts near Keen.”\n“That is not the same.” A short answer deserved an equally short rejoinder.\n“Other Memory tells me what | need to know.” That was for the acolytes.\n“It’s not the same, Tam. You have to do it yourself. A very curious sensation on Dune, knowing a worm could come at any instant and consume you.”\n“I’ve heard about your Dune... exploit.”\nExploit. Not “experience.” Exploit. Very precise with her censure. Quite like Tam. “Too much of Bell has rubbed off on her,” some will say.\n“Walking on that sort of desert changes you, Tam. Other Memory becomes clearer. It’s one thing to tap experiences of a Fremen ancestor. It’s quite different walking there as a Fremen yourself, if only for a few hours.”\n“I did not enjoy it.”\nSo much for Tam’s venturesome spirit, and everyone in the car had seen her in a bad light. Word would spread.\nOn the coals, indeed!\nBut now the shift to Sheeana on the Council (/f she suits) would have an easier explanation.\nThe observation terminal was a fused expanse of silica, green and glassy with heat bubbles through it. Odrade stood at the fused edge and noted how grass below her ended in patches, sand already invading the lower slopes of this once verdant hill. There were new saltbushes (planted by Sheeana’s people, one of Odrade’s entourage said) forming a random gray screen along the encroaching fingers of\ndesert. A silent war. Chlorophyll-based life fighting a rear- guard action against the sand.\nA low dune lifted above the terminal to her right. Waving for the others not to follow, she climbed the sandhill, and just beyond its concealing bulk, there was the desert of memory.\nSo this is what we are creating.\nNo signs of habitation. She did not look back at growing things making their last desperate struggle against invading dunes but kept her attention focused outward to the horizon. There was the boundary desert dwellers watched. Anything moving in that dry expanse was potentially dangerous.\nWhen she returned to the others, she kept her gaze for a time on the glazed surface of the terminal.\nThe older Communications acolyte came up to Odrade with a request from Weather.\nOdrade scanned it. Concise and inescapable. Nothing sudden about the changes spelled out in these words. They were asking for more ground equipment. This did not come with the abruptness of an accidental storm but with Mother Superior’s decision.\nYesterday? Did | decide to phase out the sea only yesterday?\nShe returned the report to the Communications acolyte and looked beyond her at the sand-marked glaze.\n“Request approved.” Then: “It saddens me to See all of those buildings gone back there.”\nThe acolyte shrugged. She shrugged! Odrade felt like striking her. (And wouldn’t that send upsets rumbling through the Sisterhood!)\nOdrade turned her back on the woman.\nWhat could I possibly say to her? We have been on this ground five times the lifetime of our oldest sisters. And this one shrugs.\nYet... by some standards, she knew the Sisterhood’s installations had barely reached maturity. Plaz and plasteel tended to maintain an orderly relationship between buildings and their settings. Fixed in land and memory. Towns and cities did not submit easily to other forces... except to human whims.\nAnother natural force.\nThe concept of respect for age was an odd one, she decided. Humans carried it inborn. She had seen it in the old Bashar when he spoke of his family holdings on Lernaeus.\n“We thought it fitting to keep my mother’s decor.”\nContinuity. Would a revived ghola revive those feelings as well?\nThis is where my kind have been.\nThat took on a peculiar patina when “my kind” were blood-related ancestors.\nLook how long we Atreides persisted on Caladan, restoring the old castle, polishing deep carvings in ancient wood. Whole teams of retainers just to keep the creaking old place at a level of barely tolerable functionalism.\nBut those retainers had not thought themselves ill used. There had been a sense of privilege in their labors. Hands that polished the wood almost caressed it.\n“Old. Been with the Atreides a long time now.”\nPeople and their artifacts. She felt tool sense as a living part of herself.\n“I’m better because of this stick in my hand... because of this fire-sharpened spear to kill my meat... because of this shelter against the cold... because of my stone cellar to store our winter food... because of this swift sailing vessel... this giant ocean liner... this ship of metal and ceramics that carries me into space...”\nThose first human venturers into space—how little they suspected of where the voyage would extend. How isolated they were in those ancient times! Little capsules of livable atmosphere linked to cumbersome data sources by primitive\ntransmission systems. Solitude. Loneliness. Limited opportunity for anything but surviving. Keep the air washed. Be sure of potable water. Exercise to prevent the debilitation of weightlessness. Stay active. Healthy mind in a healthy body. What was a healthy mind, anyway?\n“Mother Superior?”\nThat damned Communications acolyte again!\n“Yes?”\n“Bellonda says to tell you immediately there has been a messenger from Buzzell. Strangers came and took all of the Reverend Mothers away.”\nOdrade whirled. “Her entire message?”\n“No, Mother Superior. The strangers are described as commanded by a woman. The messenger says she had the look of an Honored Matre but was not wearing one of their robes.”\n“Nothing from Dortujla or the others?”\n“They were not given the opportunity, Mother Superior. The messenger is a First-Stage acolyte. She came in the Small no-ship following explicit orders from Dortujla.”\n“Tell Bell that acolyte must not be allowed to leave. She has dangerous information. | will brief a messenger when | return. It must be a Reverend Mother. Do you have that?”\n“Of course,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sisterhood is a powerful organization with deep knowledge and control over various aspects of society, including political and religious influences.
