What was she thinking?\n“I admitted that this had been my prayer,” Moneo said. “And the God Emperor asked me what | would give up if my life were not enough. He shouted at me: ‘What is your life when you hold back the greater gift?’”\nHwi nodded, but Idaho felt only confusion.\n“I could hear the truth in his voice,” Moneo said.\n“Are you a Truthsayer?” Hwi asked.\n“In the power of desperation, yes,” Moneo said. “But only then. | swear to you he spoke truth to me.”\n“Some of the Atreides had the power of Voice,” Idaho muttered.\nMoneo shook his head. “No, it was truth. He said to me: ‘I look at you now and if | could shed tears, | would. Consider the wish to be the act!’”\nHwi rocked forward, almost touching the table. “He Cannot cry?”\n“Sandworms,” Idaho whispered.\n“What?” Hwi turned toward him.\n“Fremen killed sandworms with water,” Idaho said. “From the drowning they produced the spice-essence for their religious orgies.”\n“But the Lord Leto is not yet a sandworm entire,” Moneo said.\nHwi rocked back onto her cushion and looked at Moneo.\nIdaho pursed his lips in thought. Did Leto have the Fremen prohibition against tears, then? How awed the Fremen had always been about such a waste of moisture! Giving water to the dead.\nMoneo addressed himself to Idaho: “I had hoped you could be brought to an understanding. The Lord Leto has\nspoken. You and Hwi must separate and never see each other again.”\nHwi removed her hand from Idaho's. “We know.”\nIdaho spoke with resigned bitterness: “We know his power.”\n“But you do not understand him,” Moneo said.\n“I want nothing more than that,” Hwi said. She put a hand on Idaho’s arm to silence him. “No, Duncan. Our private desires have no place here.”\n“Maybe you should pray to him,” Idaho said.\nShe whirled and looked at him, staring and staring until Idaho lowered his gaze. When she spoke, her voice carried a lilting quality that Idaho had never heard there before. “My Uncle Malky always said the Lord Leto never responded to prayer. He said the Lord Leto looked on prayer as attempted coercion, a form of violence against the chosen god, telling the immortal what to do: Give me a miracle, God, or | won’t believe in you!”\n“Prayer as hubris,” Moneo said. “Intercession on demand.”\n“How can he be a god?” Idaho demanded. “By his own admission, he’s not immortal.”\n“I will quote the Lord Leto on that,” Moneo said. “ʻI am all of God that need be seen. | am the word become a miracle. | am all of my ancestors. Is that not miracle enough? What more could you possibly want? Ask yourself: Where is there a greater miracle?’”\n“Empty words,” Idaho sneered.\n“I sneered at him, too,” Moneo said. “I threw his own words from the Oral History back at him: ‘Give to the greater glory of God!’”\nHwi gasped.\n“He laughed at me,” Moneo said. “He laughed and asked how | could give what already belonged to God?”\n“You were angry?” Hwi asked.\n“Oh, yes. He saw this and said he would tell me how to give to that glory. He said: ‘You may observe that you are every bit as great a miracle as | am.” Moneo turned and looked out the window on his left. “I’m afraid my anger made me deaf and | was totally unprepared.”\n“Ohhh, he is clever,” Idaho said.\n“Clever?” Moneo looked at him. “I don’t think so, not in the way you mean. | think the Lord Leto may be no more clever than | am in that way.”\n“Unprepared for what?” Hwi asked.\n“The risk,” Moneo said.\n“But you risked much in your anger,” she said.\n“Not as much as he. | see in your eyes, Hwi, that you understand this. Does his body revolt you?”\n“No more,” she said.\nIdaho ground his teeth in frustration. “He disgusts me!”\n“Love, you must not say such things,” Hwi said.\n“And you must not call him Love,” Moneo said.\n“You'd rather she learned to love someone more gross and evil than any Baron Harkonnen ever dreamed of being,” Idaho said.\nMoneo worked his lips in and out, then: “The Lord Leto has told me about that evil old man of your time, Duncan. | don’t think you understood your enemy.”\n“He was a fat, monstrous...”\n“He was a seeker after sensations,” Moneo said. “The fat was a side-effect, then perhaps something to experience for itself because it offended people and he enjoyed offending.”\n“The Baron only consumed a few planets,” Idaho said. “Leto consumes the universe.”\n“Love, please!” Hwi protested.\n“Let him rant,” Moneo said. “When | was young and ignorant, even as my Siona and this poor fool, | said similar things.”\n“Is that why you let your daughter go out to die?” Idaho demanded.\n“Love, that’s cruel,” Hwi said.\n“Duncan, it has always been one of your flaws to seek hysteria,” Moneo said. “I warn you that ignorance thrives on hysteria. Your genes provide vigor and you may inspire some among the Fish Speakers, but you are a poor leader.”\n“Don’t try to anger me,” Idaho said. “I know better than to attack you, but don’t push me too far.”\nHwi tried to take Idaho’s hand, but he pulled away.\n“I know my place,” Idaho said. “I’m a useful follower. | can carry the Atreides banner. The green and black is on my back!”\n“The undeserving maintain power by promoting hysteria, Moneo said. “The Atreides art is the art of ruling without hysteria, the art of being responsible for the uses of power.”\nIdaho pushed back and heaved himself to his feet. “When has your damned God Emperor ever been responsible for anything?”\nMoneo looked down at his cluttered table and spoke without looking up. “He is responsible for what he has done to himself.” Moneo looked up then, his eyes frosty. “You haven’t the guts, Duncan, to learn why he did that to himself!”\n“And you have?” Idaho asked.\n“When | was most angry,” Moneo said, “and he saw himself through my eyes, he said: ‘How dare you be offended by me?’ It was then”—Moneo swallowed—“that he made me look into the horror... that he had seen.” Tears welled from Moneo’s eyes and ran down his cheeks. “And | was only glad that | did not have to make his decision... that | could content myself with being a follower.”\n“I have touched him,” Hwi whispered.\n“Then you know?” Moneo asked her.\n“Without seeing it, | know,” she said.\nIn a low voice, Moneo said: “I almost died of it. |...” He shuddered, then looked up at Idaho. “You must not.. .”\n”\n“Damn you all!” Idaho snarled. He turned and dashed from the room.\nHwi stared after him, her face a mask of anguish. “Ohhh, Duncan,” she whispered.\n“You see?” Moneo asked. “You were wrong. Neither you nor the Fish Speakers have gentled him. But you, Hwi, you have only contributed to his destruction.”\nHwi turned her anguish toward Moneo. “I will not see him again,” she said.\nFor Idaho, the passage down to his quarters became one of the most difficult times in his memory. He tried to imagine that his face was a plasteel mask held immobile to hide the turmoil within. None of the guards he passed could be permitted to see his pain. He did not know that most of them made accurate guesses about his emotion and shared a compassion for him. All of them had sat through briefings on the Duncans and had learned to read them well.\nIn the corridor near his quarters, Idaho encountered Nayla walking slowly toward him. Something in her face, a look of indecision and loss, stopped him briefly and almost brought him out of his internal concentration.\n“Friend?” he said, soeaking when he was only a few paces from her.\nShe looked at him, abrupt recognition obvious on her Square face.\nWhat an odd-looking woman, he thought.\n“Lam no longer Friend,” she said and passed by him down the corridor.\nIdaho turned on one heel and stared at her retreating back—those heavy shoulders, that plodding sense of terrible muscles.\nWhat was she bred for? he wondered.\nIt was only a passing thought. His own concerns returned more strongly than before. He strode the few paces to his door and into his quarters.\nOnce inside, Idaho stood a moment with clenched fists at his sides.\n| have no more ties to any time, he thought. And how odd that this was not a liberating thought. He knew, though, that he had done the thing which would begin freeing Hwi from her love for him. He was diminished. She would think of him soon as a small, petulant fool, a subject only of his own emotions. He could feel himself fading from her immediate concerns.\nAnd that poor Moneo!\nIdaho sensed the shape of the things which had formed the pliant majordomo. Duty and responsibility. What a safe haven those were in a time of difficult decisions.\n| was like that once, |\\daho thought. But that was in another life, another time.\nThe Duncans sometimes ask if | understand the exotic ideas of our past. And if | understand them, why can’t | explain them? Knowledge, the Duncans believe, resides only in particulars. | try to tell them that all words are plastic. Word images begin to distort in the instant of utterance. Ideas imbedded in a language require that particular language for expression. This is the very essence of the meaning within the word exotic. See how it begins to distort? Translation squirms in the presence of the exotic. The Galach which | speak here imposes itself. It is an outside frame of reference, a particular system. Dangers lurk in all systems. Systems incorporate the unexamined beliefs of their creators. Adopt a system, accept its beliefs, and you help strengthen the resistance to change. Does it serve any purpose for me to tell the Duncans that there are no languages for some things? Ahhh! But the Duncans believe that all languages are mine.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nor two full turns of days and nights, Siona failed to seal\nher face mask, losing precious water with every breath.
