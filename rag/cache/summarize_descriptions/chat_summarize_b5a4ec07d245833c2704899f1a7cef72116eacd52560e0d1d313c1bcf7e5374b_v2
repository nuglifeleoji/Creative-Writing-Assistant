Prior to their current mission, Siona warned Idaho at the Citadel, suggesting her role as an informant or strategist. Her connection to the Citadel is further emphasized when she is taken there by the Fish Speakers, indicating either her importance to the site or their surveillance over her.  \n\nDriven by rebellion, Siona actively seeks to uncover secrets within the Citadel, demonstrating her defiance against established authority. Her actions include stealing items from the Citadel to support her cause, reinforcing her role as a dissident. These activities highlight her resourcefulness and determination to challenge the powers associated with the Citadel.  \n\nIn summary, Siona’s relationship with the Citadel is multifaceted—she operates within it as both a participant and an adversary, leveraging its resources while resisting its control.
