\n　　……孙少平很晚才从小南河的岸边回到他做活的南关柴油机厂。 \n　　两天以后，他的心情已稍许平静下来。这里很快就要结工，他重新发愁他过几天到什么地方去干活——他真没勇气再到东关的劳力市场去等待包工头把他“买”走。 \n　　生活的沉重感，有时大大冲淡了他对田晓霞的那种感情渴望。人处在幸福与不幸交织的矛盾之中，反而使内心有一种更为深刻的痛苦，看来近在眼前的幸福而实际上又远得相当渺茫，海市蜃楼。放不得抓不住。一腔难言的滋味。啊，人哪！有时候还不如生活在纯粹的清苦与孤独之中。 \n　　两天来，少平无论是干活，还是晚上躺在那个没门没窗的房子里，都在思索着他和晓霞的关系——连做梦也想的是这件事，他越想越感到悲观；热情如同炉火中拉出来的铁块，慢慢地冷却下来了……按原先约的时间，这天下午晚饭后，他应该到地委她父亲的办公室去找她。当然，在那个老地方的这次新的会面，将会不同以往——他们现在已经越过了那条“界线”，完全是另一种关系了。 \n　　少平不因为两天来悲观的思考就打算失约。不，他实际上又在内心激动地、迫不及待地期待着和晓霞见面。 \n　　刚和一群赤膊裸体的同伙吃完饭，他就十分匆忙地在楼道的水管上冲洗了身子，返回宿舍从枕头底下抽出那身洗得干干净净、压得平平整整的衣服换在身上。仍然用五个手指头代替梳子，把洗净的头发拨弄蓬松，梳理整齐。他赤脚片穿起那双新买的凉鞋，就急切地下了楼。 \n　　出柴油机厂的门房时，他在那扇破玻璃窗户上看来无意实际有意照了照自己的身姿。他对自己的“印象”还不错。真的，除过脸和两条胳膊被太阳晒得黝黑外，他现在看起来又不象个揽工汉了！ \n　　孙少平怀着欢欣而紧张的心情，不知不觉就来到了地委常委办公院。 \n　　不知为什么，这次在进入那个窑洞时，他心中充满了恐惧。他看见那窗户亮着灯光。她在。那灯光是如此炽烈，象熊熊燃烧的大火。他不由颤栗了一下。 \n　　现在已到了门口。心跳得象擂雷一般。他困难地咽下去一口吐沫，终于举起了僵硬的右手，象有规矩的城里人一样，用指关节轻轻叩响了门。 \n　　叩门声如同爆炸一般在耳边，在心中荡起\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
