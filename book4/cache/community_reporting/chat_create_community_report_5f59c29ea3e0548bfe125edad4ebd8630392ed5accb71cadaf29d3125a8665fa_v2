They were responsible for numerous purges and campaigns that led to widespread persecution, social chaos, and a significant disruption of traditional farming practices. Their influence contributed to a climate of fear and repression, which many believe stunted China's development during that era.\n\nFollowing the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the Gang of Four was arrested, marking a pivotal moment in Chinese history.
