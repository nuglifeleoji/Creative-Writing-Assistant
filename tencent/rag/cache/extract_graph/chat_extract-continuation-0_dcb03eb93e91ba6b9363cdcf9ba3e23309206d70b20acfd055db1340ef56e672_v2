As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.” She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. “And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.” She shifted her attention to Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”\n“Indeed it is,” Kynes said.\nThe stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: “I do believe I'll eat something now. I’d like some of that bird dish you served earlier.”\nJessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits. | find so many interesting things about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into the desert?”\n“Oh, no, my Lady,” he said. “Very little’s known of the deep desert. And almost nothing of the southern regions.”\n“There’s a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the southern reaches,” Kynes said, “but | suspect it was an imaginative invention made solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters do, on occasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that’s extremely dangerous— navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn’t been found profitable to venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather satellite....”\nBewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: “It’s said the Fremen travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells even in the southern latitudes.”\n“Soaks and sip-wells?” Jessica asked.\nKynes spoke quickly: “Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other planets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs. A sip-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw...so it is said.”\nThere’s deception in his words, Jessica thought.\nWhy is he lying? Paul wondered.\n“How very interesting,” Jessica said. And she thought: “/t is said....” What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions.\n“I’ve heard you have a saying,” Paul said, “that polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert.”\n“There are many sayings on Arrakis,” Kynes said.\nBefore Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a note. She opened it, saw the Duke’s handwriting and code signs, scanned it.\n“You'll all be delighted to know,” she said, “that our Duke sends his reassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The missing carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers’ base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.” She nodded to Tuek.\nThe smuggler nodded back.\nJessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.\n“l'm glad it didn’t come to open battle,” the banker said. “The people have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.”\n“Especially prosperity,” Bewt said.\n“Shall we have our dessert now?” Jessica asked. “I’ve had our chef prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.”\n“It sounds wonderful,” the stillsuit manufacturer said. “Would it be possible to get the recipe?”\n“Any recipe you desire,” Jessica said, registering the man for later mention to Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be\nbought.\nSmall talk resumed around her: “Such a lovely fabric....” “He is having a setting made to match the jewel....” “We might try for a production increase next quarter....”\nJessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto’s message: The Harkonnens tried to get ina shipment of lasguns. We captured them. This may mean they’ve succeeded with other shipments. It certainly means they don’t place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions.\nJessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.\nThe unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.\nPaul said: “I never doubted we’d find the carryall. Once my father moves to solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to discover.”\nHe’s boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn’t boast. No person who'll be sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has the right to boast.\nThere is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nessica heard the disturbance in the great hall,\nturned on the light beside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A.M.\nThe disturbance was loud and incoherent.\nIs this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.\nShe slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family was. The screen Showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they’d hastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn’t penetrating to his quarters. There was no one in the Duke’s room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.?\nThere were no screens yet to the front of the house.\nJessica stood in the middle of her room, listening. There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr. Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into\nSlippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.\nAgain, a voice called out for Yueh.\nJessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the thought struck her: What if\nLeto’s hurt?\nThe hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned through the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum.\nTo her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting silence to the scene.\nOne of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: “You see what you did? You woke the Lady Jessica.”\nThe great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door remained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one Side staring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.\n“So | woke the Lady Jessica,” Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the ceiling, bellowed: “My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman!”\nGreat Mother! He’s drunk! Jessica thought.\nIdaho’s dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the fur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.\nJessica crossed to him.\nOne of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. “We didn’t know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance out\nfront, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along and see him. That wouldn’t do at all. Give us a bad name here.”\n“Where has he been?” Jessica asked.\n“He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat’s orders.”\n“Which young lady?”\n“One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?” He glanced at Mapes, lowered his voice. “They’re always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of the ladies.”\nAnd Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?\nShe frowned, turned to Mapes. “Mapes, bring a stimulant. I'd suggest caffeine. Perhaps there’s some of the spice coffee left.”\nMapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor.\nIdaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica. “Killed more’n three hunner’ men f’r the Duke,” he muttered. “Whadduh wanna know is why’m mere? Can't live unner th’ groun’ here. Can’t live onna groun’ here. Wha’ kinna place is \"iss, huh?”\nA sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica’s attention. She turned, saw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was fully dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his forehead.\n“Th’ good docker!” Idaho shouted. “Whad’re you, Doc? Splint ’n’ pill man?” He turned blearily toward\nJessica. “Makin’ uh damn fool uh m’self, huh?”\nJessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk? Was he drugged?\n“Too much spice beer,” Idaho said, attempting to Straighten.\nMapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, Stopped uncertainly behind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.\nYueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: “Spice beer, eh?”\n“Bes’ damn stuff ever tas’ed,” Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to attention. “My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon...Harkon... killed ‘im f’r th’ Duke.”\nYueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes’ hand. “What is that?”\n“Caffeine,” Jessica said.\nYueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. “Drink this, lad.”\n“Don’t wan’ any more t’ drink.”\n“Drink it, | say!”\nIdaho’s head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging the guards with him. “I’m almighdy fed up with pleasin’ th’ ’Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus’ once, we’re gonna do th’ thing my way.\n“After you drink this,” Yueh said. “It’s just caffeine.”\n“\"Sprolly like all res’ uh this place! Damn’ sun ’stoo brighd. Nothin’ has uh righd color. Ever’thing’s wrong Ofiri”\n”\n“Well, it’s nighttime now,” Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. “Drink this like a good lad. It'll make you feel better.”\n“Don’ wanna feel bedder!”\n“We can’t argue with him all night,” Jessica said. And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.\n“There\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ATREIDES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Atreides are a noble house engaged in a feud with the Harkonnens and currently ruling Arrakis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HARKONNEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Harkonnens are a rival noble house to the Atreides, known for their enmity and scheming>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Guild Bank is a financial institution that supports the Duke in his actions against the Harkonnens>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JESSICA<|>PERSON<|>Jessica is a key figure in the Atreides household, involved in diplomatic and strategic discussions>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>PERSON<|>The Duke is the leader of the Atreides, making strategic decisions and ensuring the safety of his house>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYNES<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Kynes is a knowledgeable figure on Arrakis, involved in discussions about the planet's ecology and spice>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL<|>PERSON<|>Paul is the son of Duke Leto and Jessica, showing signs of leadership and awareness of political dynamics>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BEWT<|>PERSON<|>Bewt is a guest at the dinner, involved in discussions about spice and Arrakis>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a loyal warrior of the Atreides, known for his combat skills and occasional recklessness>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet, the source of the valuable spice melange, and the current seat of Atreides power>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHIELD WALL<|>GEO<|>The Shield Wall is a geographical feature on Arrakis, serving as a base for spice hunting operations>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan is the former home planet of the Atreides, known for its lush environment>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KANLY<|>EVENT<|>Kanly is a formal feud or vendetta, sworn by Duke Leto against the Harkonnens>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE HUNTING<|>EVENT<|>Spice hunting is a dangerous activity on Arrakis, involving the extraction of the valuable spice melange>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>DUKE LETO<|>Jessica is the Duke's consort and a key advisor in his strategic decisions<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>JESSICA<|>Paul is Jessica's son, showing signs of inheriting her political acumen<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PAUL<|>DUKE LETO<|>Paul is the Duke's son and heir, learning leadership from him<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ATREIDES<|>HARKONNEN<|>The Atreides and Harkonnens are engaged in a bitter feud, including acts of sabotage and warfare<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>ATREIDES<|>Duke Leto is the leader of the Atreides house, making key decisions for its survival<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYNES<|>ARRAKIS<|>Dr. Kynes is deeply knowledgeable about Arrakis's ecology and spice<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>ATREIDES<|>Duncan Idaho is a loyal warrior serving the Atreides house<|>8>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JESSICA<|>GUILD BANK<|>Jessica interacts with the Guild Bank agent, acknowledging their support for the Duke<|>5>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRAKIS<|>SPICE HUNTING<|>Arrakis is the primary location for spice hunting, a key economic activity<|>9>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUKE LETO<|>KANLY<|>Duke Leto has sworn kanly against the Harkonnens, a formal vendetta<|>7>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BEWT<|>SPICE HUNTING<|>Bewt discusses the dangers and profitability of spice hunting on Arrakis<|>6>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNCAN IDAHO<|>DUKE LETO<|>Duncan Idaho is fiercely loyal to Duke Leto, having fought many battles for him<|>8>  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
