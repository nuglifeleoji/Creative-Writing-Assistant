富坚的尸体是怎么处理的？石神什么也没告诉靖子。他说她用不着想那种事。靖子还记得他在电话彼端，淡淡地说他已经全都妥善处理好了，什么都不用担心。\n    她的确感到奇怪，警方为何问的是犯案翌日的不在场证明。之前，石神已吩咐过三月十日晚上该怎么行动。电影院、拉面店、KTV、还有深夜的电话。样样都是照他的指示做的，但她并不了解这么做的用意。刑警问起不在场证明时，虽然她一一据实回答，但心理其实很想反问：为什么是三月十日―――\n    她全都明白了。警方令人费解的调查，原来全都是石神设计好的。但他设计的内容实在太过惊悚。从汤川那里听到时，虽然心知除此之外的确别无可能，但她还是无法相信。不，是不愿相信。她不愿去想石神牺牲到如此地步，她不愿去想石神为了自己这么一个毫无长处、平凡无奇、又没什么魅力的中年女人，竟然毁了自己的一生。靖子觉得自己的心还没坚强到足以承受这个事实。\n    她用手蒙着脸，什么都不愿想。汤川说他不会告诉警方，他说一切都只是推论毫无证据，所以你可以自由选择今后该走的路。她不由得恨恨的想，他逼她做的是何等残酷的选择。\n    她不知道今后该怎么办，甚至无力站起。正当她像石头一样缩着身子之际，突然有人拍她的肩，她吓得猛然抬头。\n    身旁站着人，仰脸一看，工藤正忧心忡忡地俯视着她。\n    “你怎么了？”\n    一时之间她无法理解，工藤怎会在这出现。看着他的脸，这才渐渐想起约好要碰面。大概是在约定地点等不到她，所以担心之下才出来找她吧。\n    “对不起。我有点……太累了。”除此之外，她想不出别的藉口，况且她的确很累。当然不是身体，而是精神上的疲惫。\n    “你身体不舒服吗？”工藤柔声问道。\n    但就连那温柔的声音，在此刻的靖子听来都显得好愚蠢。她这才明白，有时不知道真相原来也是一种罪恶，她觉得不久之前的自己也是如此。\n    不要紧，靖子说着试图起身。看她一个踉跄，工藤连忙伸手挽扶。她说了声谢谢。\n    “出了什么事？你的脸色好像不太好。”\n    靖子摇头。他不是可以解释的对象，这世上找不到那样的人。\n    “真的没什么，只是有点不舒服所以在这休息一下，已经没事了。”她想发出开朗的声音，但是实在提不起那个精神。\n    “我的车就停在旁边，休息一下我们就走吧。”\n    工藤的话，令靖子不由得回视他的脸。“去哪里？”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
