\n　　有一个人对他说：“你给学校告去吧！到时候，我们就说，你污蔑高来顺偷吃你的饼干，我们和你讲理，但你先动手打人，我们只好嘛……” \n　　这群人又一齐笑了。 \n　　顾养民揩掉自己脸上的泪水，说：“我不告你们……” \n　　他这句话倒使这些人一惊。金波他们都不再言传，也不笑了。 \n　　顾养民一瘸一拐出了这个宿舍。他也没回他自己的宿舍去。他走到校园东南角的那一片小树林中，抱住一根杨树杆，无声地啜泣起来…… \n　　孙少平在第二天才知道金波串联一些人把顾养民打了一顿。他又急又慌，找到金波，埋怨他不该这样。金波让他别管，说他把事干得滴水不漏。 \n　　“让顾养民告去吧！他小子挨了打，官司也打不赢！他一张嘴，我们七八张嘴，他说不过我们。”他对少平说。但孙少平觉得事情并不那么简单。顾养民不会受这口气，肯定要向学校反映。如果真相一旦查明，学校可能要把金波开除的。但他又不能过分指责金波，因为他这行为完全是为他的呀！ \n　　孙少平一个人想：如果顾养民告到学校，学校开始查这事的时候，他就站出来说是他让金波打顾养民的。决不能让学校处理金波！金波是为他的，他一定要为金波承担罪责！ \n　　在好几天里，孙少平已经顾不上想其它事了，紧张地等待着学校来调查这事。 \n　　但过了好多天，一切仍然风平浪静。金波曾给他说过，顾养民自己说不告他们，少平当时不相信这话。但现在看来顾养民真的没有去告！班长现在看来也和以前没有什么不同，表现出什么事也没有发生的样子，并且对金波和打过他的同学态度也很正常：既不特意好，也不让人看出怀恨在心。只是在挨打的第二天，他给老师请假，说他感冒了，要上一趟医院。据金波说，顾养民上医院的那一天，郝红梅竟然偷偷到医院看他去了…… \n　　金波他们把顾养民打了一顿，反而使郝红梅更挨近了顾养民。也许他们两个分析过养民挨打的原因——金波心再残，也不会平白无故打人，唯一的可能就是因为郝红梅。她先后与少平和养民的关系变化大家都能看得出来。孙少平不出面，让他的朋友来替他报复——除此之外，还会有什么解释呢？ \n　　孙少平看得出来，郝红梅现在甚至都恨上了他，见了面连看都不看他一眼。顾养民心里不知怎样，面子上还和他保持着一般交往的关系。当然，不论是在他面前，还是在众人面前，他现在已经不回避他和郝红梅的相好关系。至于郝红梅，倒似乎专意让别人知道\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
