Once the sole source of the spice melange, RAKIS remains central to power struggles due to its historical and economic importance, despite its eventual destruction by the Honored Matres.  \n\nThe planet is home to giant sandworms, which produce melange, and is deeply tied to the legacy of the Tyrant Leto II (the God Emperor), who transformed into a sandworm and ruled from RAKIS. His journals were discovered here, and his influence persists through the Holy Church of the Divided God, whose priests and High Priest reside in cities like Keen, Dar-es-Balat, and Onn.  \n\nRAKIS is a key location for the Bene Gesserit, who maintain a stronghold in the holy city of Keen and conduct operations involving spice production, ghola projects, and political maneuvering. The planet is also significant to the Tleilaxu, who compete for control of melange, especially after developing tank-grown spice.  \n\nA pivotal figure on RAKIS is Sheeana Brugh, a girl capable of controlling sandworms, making her central to Bene Gesserit plans. The planet’s dusty environment, heat-bounce effect, and temple complexes underscore its harsh yet sacred nature.  \n\nDespite its destruction, RAKIS remains a symbol of the Tyrant’s Golden Path and a focal point in conflicts involving the Bene Gesserit, Honored Matres, and Tleilaxu. Its ruins and legacy continue to shape the universe, with Duncan Idaho’s eventual journey to RAKIS highlighting its enduring importance.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",44\n1538,SHEEANA BRUGH,\"Sheeana Brugh is a female child on Rakis who can control the giant worms, a significant figure in the Dune series\"\"\",1\n1562,CHURCH OF SHAI-HULUD,\"The Church of Shai-hulud is the religion of the Divided God on Rakis, centered around the worship of sandworms\",1\n1730,TYRANT'S NO-GLOBE,\"Hidden structure on Rakis that spawned a religious community near Dar-es-Balat\"\"\",1\n1752,SHADOW LINE,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4406,OLD WOMAN,FREMEN,The old woman is a diminished descendant of the once-proud Fremen,199\n2837,RAKIS,ONN,Onn is a major city on the planet Rakis.,58\n3579,RAKIS,SHEEANA BRUGH,Sheeana Brugh is a child on Rakis who can control the giant worms,45\n3651,CHURCH OF SHAI-HULUD,RAKIS,Rakis is the center of the Church of Shai-hulud and the worship of sandworms,45\n4129,RAKIS,TYRANT'S NO-GLOBE,The Tyrant's no-globe is a hidden structure on Rakis with religious significance,45\n4184,RAKIS,SHADOW LINE,\"The Shadow line is a natural phenomenon unique to Rakis' solar cycles, used for timekeeping.\",45\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
