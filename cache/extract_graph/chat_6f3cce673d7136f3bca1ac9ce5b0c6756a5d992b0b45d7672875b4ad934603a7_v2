The compassion in his voice wrenched at Leto.\n“The bright shadows of my pasts,” Leto said. “They never leave me in peace. | listened for a soothing sound, the bell\nof a country town at nightfall, and it told me only that | am the sound and soul of this place.”\nAs he spoke, darkness enclosed the tower. Automatic lights came on around them. Leto kept his attention directed outward where a thin melon slice of First Moon drifted above the clouds with orange planet-light revealing the satellite’s full circle.\n“Lord, why have we come out here?” Moneo asked. “Why won't you tell me?”\n“I wanted the benefit of your surprise,” Leto said. “A Guild lighter will land beside us out here soon. My Fish Speakers bring Malky to me.”\nMoneo inhaled a quick breath and held it a moment before exhaling. “Hwi’s ... uncle? That Malky?”\n“You are surprised that you had no warning of this,” Leto said.\nMoneo felt a chill all through his body. “Lord, when you wish to keep things secret from...”\n“Moneo?” Leto spoke in a softly persuasive tone. “I know that Malky offered you greater temptations than any other...”\n“Lord! I never...”\n“I know that, Moneo.” Still in that soft tone. “But surprise has shocked your memories alive. You are armed for anything | may require of you.”\n“What... what does my Lord...”\n“Perhaps we will have to dispose of Malky. He is a problem.”\n“Me? You want meto...”\n“Perhaps.”\nMoneo swallowed, then: “The Reverend Mother...”\n“Anteac is dead. She served me well, but she is dead. There was extreme violence when my Fish Speakers attacked the... place where Malky lay hidden.”\n“We are better off without Anteac,” Moneo said.\n“| appreciate your distrust of the Bene Gesserit, but | would that Anteac had left us in another way. She was faithful to us, Moneo.”\n“A Reverend Mother was...”\n“Both the Bene Tleilax and the Guild wanted Malky’s secret,” Leto said. “When they saw us move against the Ixians, they struck ahead of my Fish Speakers. Anteac... well, she could only delay them a bit, but it was enough. My Fish Speakers invested the place...”\n“Malky’s secret, Lord?”\n“When a thing vanishes,” Leto said, “that is as much of a message as when a thing suddenly appears. The empty Spaces are always worthy of our study.”\n“What does my Lord mean, empty...”\n“Malky did not die! Certainly | would have known that. Where did he go when he vanished?”\n“Vanished ... from you, Lord? Do you mean that the Ixians...”\n“They have improved upon a device they gave me long ago. They improved it slowly and subtly, hidden shells within hidden shells, but | noted the shadows. | was surprised. | was pleased.”\nMoneo thought about this. A device which concealed... Ahhhh! The God Emperor had mentioned a thing on several occasions, a way of concealing the thoughts he recorded. Moneo spoke:\n“And Malky brings the secret of .. .”\n“Oh, yes! But that is not Malky’s real secret. He holds another thing in his bosom which he does not think that | Suspect.”\n“Another... but, Lord, if they can hide even from you...”\n“Many can do that now, Moneo. They scattered when my Fish Speakers attacked. The secret of the Ixian device is spread far and wide.”\nMoneo’s eyes went wide with alarm. “Lord, if anyone...”\n“If they learn to be clever, they will leave no tracks,” Leto said. “Tell me, Moneo, what does Nayla say about the Duncan? Does she resent reporting directly to you?”\n“Whatever my Lord commands . . .” Moneo cleared his throat. He could not fathom why his God Emperor spoke of hidden tracks, the Duncan and Nayla in the same breath.\n“Yes, of course,” Leto said. “Whatever | command, Nayla obeys. And what does she say of the Duncan?”\n“He has not tried to breed with Siona, if that is my Lord’s...”\n“But what does he do with my puppet Naib, Garun, and the other Museum Fremen?”\n“He speaks to them of the old ways, of the wars against the Harkonnens, of the first Atreides here on Arrakis.”\n“On Dune!”\n“Dune, yes.”\n“It’s because there’s no more Dune that there are no more Fremen,” Leto said. “Have you conveyed my message to Nayla?”\n“Lord, why do you add to your peril?”\n“Did you convey my message?”\n“The messenger has been sent to Tuono, but | could still call her back.”\n“You will not call her back!”\n“But, Lord...”\n“What will she say to Nayla?”\n“That... that it is your command for Nayla to continue in absolute and unquestioning obedience of my daughter except insofar... Lord! This is dangerous!”\n“Dangerous? Nayla is a Fish Speaker. She will obey me.”\n“But Siona... Lord, | fear that my daughter does not serve you with all of her heart. And Nayla is...”\n“Nayla must not deviate.”\n“Lord, let us hold your wedding in some other place.”\n“No!”\n“Lord, | know that your vision has revealed...”\n“The Golden Path endures, Moneo. You know that as well as |.”\nMoneo sighed. “Infinity is yours, Lord. | do not question the...” He broke off as a monstrous shuddering roar shook the tower, louder and louder.\nBoth of them turned toward the sound—a descending plume of blue-orange light filled with swirling shockwaves came down to the desert less than a kilometer away to the south.\n“Ahhh, my guest arrives,” Leto said. “I will send you down on my cart, Moneo. Bring only Malky back with you. Tell the Guildsmen this has earned my forgiveness, then send them away.”\n“Your for... yes, Lord. But if they have the secret of...”\n“They serve my purpose, Moneo. You must do the same. Bring Malky to me.”\nObediently, Moneo went to the cart which lay in shadows at the far side of the aerie chamber. He clambered on it, watched a mouth of night appear in the Wall. A landing-lip extruded into that night. The cart drifted outward, feather- light, and floated at an angle to the sand beside a Guild lighter which stood upright like a distorted miniature of the Little Citadel’s tower.\nLeto watched from the balcony, his front segments lifted Slightly to provide him a better viewing angle. His acute eyesight identified the white movement of Moneo standing on the cart in the moonlight. Long-legged Guild servitors came out with a litter which they slid onto the cart, standing there a moment in conversation with Moneo. When they left, Leto closed the cart’s bubble cover and saw moonlight reflected from it. At his beckoning thought, the cart and its burden returned to the landing-lip. The Guild lighter lifted in its noisy rumbling while Leto was bringing the cart into the chamber’s lights, closing the entrance behind it. Leto opened the bubble cover. Sand grated beneath him as he rolled to the litter and lifted his front segments to peer in at\nMalky who lay as though sleeping, lashed into the litter by broad gray elastic bindings. The man’s face was ashen under dark gray hair.\nHow he has aged, Leto thought.\nMoneo stepped down off the cart and looked back at the litter’s occupant. “He is injured, Lord. They want to send a medical...”\n“They wanted to send a spy.”\nLeto studied Malky—the dark wrinkled skin, the sunken cheeks, that sharp nose at such contrast with the rounded oval of his face. The heavy eyebrows had turned almost white. There but for a lifetime of testosterone... yes.\nMalky’s eyes opened. Such a shock to find evil in those doe-like brown eyes! A smile twitched Malky’s mouth.\n“Lord Leto.” Malky’s voice was little more than a husky whisper. His eyes turned right, focusing on the majordomo. “And Moneo. Forgive me for not rising to the occasion.”\n“Are you in pain?” Leto asked.\n“Sometimes.” Malky’s eyes moved to study his Surroundings. “Where are the houris?”\n“I’m afraid | must deny you that pleasure, Malky.”\n“Just as well,” Malky husked. “I don’t really feel up to their demands. Those were not houris you sent after me, Leto.”\n“They were professional in their obedience to me,” Leto said.\n“They were bloody hunters!”\n“Anteac was the hunter. My Fish Speakers were merely the clean-up crew.”\nMoneo shifted his attention from one speaker to the other, back and forth. There were disturbing undertones in this conversation. Despite the huskiness, Malky sounded almost flippant... but then he had always been that way. A dangerous man!\nLeto said: “Just before your arrival, Moneo and | were discussing Infinity.”\n“Poor Moneo,” Malky said.\nLeto smiled. “Do you remember, Malky? You once asked me to demonstrate Infinity.”\n“You said no Infinity exists to be demonstrated.” Malky swept his gaze toward Moneo. “Leto likes to play with paradox. He knows all the tricks of language that have ever been discovered.”\nMoneo put down a surge of anger. He felt excluded from this conversation, an object of amusement by two superior beings. Malky and the God Emperor were almost like two old friends reliving the pleasures of a mutual past.\n“Moneo accuses me of being the sole possessor of Infinity,” Leto said. “He refuses to believe that he has just as much of Infinity as | have.”\nMalky stared up at Leto. “You see, Moneo? You see how tricky he is with words?”\n“Tell me about your niece, Hwi Noree,” Leto said.\n“Is it true, Leto, what they say? That you are going to wed the gentle Hwi?”\n“It is true.”\nMalky chuckled, then grimaced with pain. “They did terrible damage to me, Leto,” he whispered, then: “Tell me, old worm...”\nMoneo gasped.\nMalky took a moment to recover from pain, then: “Tell me, old worm, is there a monster penis hidden in that monster body of yours? What a shock for the gentle Hwi!”\n“I told you the truth about that long ago,” Leto said.\n“Nobody tells the truth,” Malky husked.\n“You often told me the truth,” Leto said. “Even when you didn’t know it.”\n“That’s because you’re cleverer than the rest of us.”\n“Will you tell me about Hwi?”\n“I think you already know it.”\n“I want to hear it from you,” Leto said. “Did you get help from the Tleilaxu?”\n“They gave us knowledge, nothing more. Everything else we did for ourselves.”\n“I thought it was not the Tleilaxu’s doing.”\nMoneo could no longer\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6f3cce673d7136f3bca1ac9ce5b0c6756a5d992b0b45d7672875b4ad934603a7_v2"}
