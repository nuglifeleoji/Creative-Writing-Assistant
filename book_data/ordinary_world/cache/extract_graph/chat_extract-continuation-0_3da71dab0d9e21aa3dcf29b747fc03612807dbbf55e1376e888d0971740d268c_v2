�嘴八舌劝导这家人不要哭了。他们指出，乔迁新居是一件吉利事，在这样的日子里哭鼻流水很不适当。金俊文父子三个于是就不哭了；接着，张桂兰和俊武的媳妇也先后停止了哭声。但俊武两个年幼的孩子继续在炕上和奶奶一起哭个不停。俊文他妈是金家族里的老寿星，又稍识文理，她不会接受晚辈们浅薄而世俗的劝导，只管哭她的。她一边哭，一边一次又一次声明：家里的其他人愿往什么地方搬哩，反正她不走！她死也要死在这窑洞里！ \n　　宽容的读者，你们想想，对于这老太太来说，世界上还有什么地方能比得上她丈夫留下的这地方值得她留恋？她住在这窑洞里，就会温暖地回忆起已故的先生；回忆起当年她和丈夫在这里度过的那些美妙的时光。如果离开这些回忆，让她怎样再活下去呢？因此在她看来，迁居到另外的地方，还不如让她去金家祖坟那里和金先生合葬在一起！下午时分，搬迁的几家人都已经把所有的东西搬运光了，现在马上要动手拆门窗。但是金家的人做不通金老太太的工作。老人家仍然坐在金俊文家土炕的光席片上，死活不离开这个家。 \n　　没有办法！金俊武只好打发金强去报告大队副书记金俊山，看大队领导怎么办呀。在金俊武看来，这里的家无论怎样都已经完蛋了，能劝说母亲起身也就算了。但老母亲宁死不屈，他也没办法。让大队领导去做工作吧！给他们出个难题也好！反正这是个快八十岁的老人，他们总不敢动武吧？如果他母亲有个三长两短，那也叫他们吃不了兜着走！ \n　　金俊山听说这事后，想来想去自己也没办法——连儿子们都劝说不下这位老祖宗，他是两旁世人，怎么可能做通工作呢？ \n　　他只好又去找田福堂，看他怎办呀。 \n　　田福堂已经把夏末那一场动乱早已抛在了脑后。他现在正情绪高涨地准备创造惊世骇俗、震动四方的业绩。 \n　　他听俊山江报了俊武家的情况后，心里倒有点着急起来——他没想到事当临头却又横生出这么一个障碍！ \n　　这件事的确令人头疼。俊武他妈已年近八十，又是当年前后村庄有名望的金先生的遗孀，除过劝说和开导老太太挪窝，其它办法显然都不是办法。可眼看一切方面都准备好了，仅仅因为这么一个老人就把一河活水堵塞，怎么行呢？ \n　　他一时也没有个好主意，就让金俊山先去做点工作，说让他自己想一想再说；他告诉金俊山，他一会就过金家湾来。\n######################\nOutput:",
