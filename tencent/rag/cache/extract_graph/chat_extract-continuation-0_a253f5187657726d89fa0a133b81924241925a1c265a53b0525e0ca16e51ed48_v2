Is that like melange?”\n“It improves flavor but won’t change consciousness.” She stood and looked down at him from her full height. “Mark this place well, Miles. Our ancestral worlds are gone, but here we have recaptured part of our origins.”\nHe sensed she was teaching him something important. He asked Odrade: “Why did you wonder if this planet owned us?”\n“My Sisterhood believes we are stewards of the land. Do you know about stewards?”\n“Like Roitiro, my friend Yorgi’s father. Yorgi says his oldest sister will be steward of their plantation someday.”\n“Correct. We have a longer residence on some planets than any other people we know of but we are only stewards.”\n“If you don’t own Chapterhouse, who does?”\n“Perhaps nobody. My question is: How have we marked each other, my Sisterhood, and this planet?”\nHe looked up at her face then down at his hands. Was Chapterhouse marking him right now?\n“Most of the marks are deep inside us.” She took his hand. “Come along.” They left the aromatic dell and climbed up into Roitiro’s domain, Odrade speaking as they went.\n“The Sisterhood seldom creates botanical gardens,” she said. “Gardens must support far more than eyes and nose.”\n“Food?”\n“Yes, supportive first of our lives. Gardens produce food. That dell back there is harvested for our kitchens.”\nHe felt her words flow into him, lodging there among the gaps. He sensed planning for centuries ahead: trees to replace building beams, to hold watersheds, plants to keep lake and river banks from crumbling, to hold topsoil safe from rain and wind, to maintain seashores and even in the waters to make places for fish to breed. The Bene Gesserit\nalso thought of trees for shade and shelter, or to cast interesting shadows on lawns.\n“Trees and other plants for all of our symbiotic relationships,” she said.\n“Symbiotic?” It was a new word.\nShe explained with something she knew he already had encountered—going out with others to harvest mushrooms.\n“Fungi won’t grow except in the company of friendly roots. Each has a symbiotic relationship with a special plant. Each growing thing takes something it needs from the other.”\nShe went on at length and, bored with learning, he kicked a clump of grass, then saw how she stared at him in that disturbing way. He had done something offensive. Why was it right to step on one growing thing and not on another?\n“Miles! Grass keeps the wind from carrying topsoil into difficult places such as the bottoms of rivers.”\nHe knew that tone. Reprimanding. He stared down at the grass he had offended.\n“These grasses feed our cattle. Some have seeds we eat in bread and other foods. Some cane grasses are windbreaks.”\nHe knew that! Trying to divert her, he said: “Wind- brakes?” spelling it.\nShe did not smile and he knew he had been wrong to think he could fool her. Resigned to it, he listened as she went on with the lesson.\nWhen the desert came, she told him, grapes, their taproots down several hundred meters, probably would be the last to go. Orchards would die first.\n“Why do they have to die?”\n“To make room for more important life.”\n“Sandworms and melange.”\nHe saw he had pleased her by knowing the relationship between sandworms and the spice the Bene Gesserit needed for their existence. He was not sure how that need\nworked but he imagined a circle: Sandworms to sandtrout to melange and back again. And the Bene Gesserit took what they needed from the circle.\nHe was still tired of all this teaching, and asked: “If all these things are going to die anyway, why do I have to go back to the library and learn their names?”\n“Because you’re human and humans have this deep desire to classify, to apply labels to everything.”\n“Why do we have to name things like that?”\n“Because that way we lay claim to what we name. We assume an ownership that can be misleading and dangerous.”\nSo she was back on ownership.\n“My street, my lake, my planet,” she said. “My label forever. A label you give to a place or thing may not even last out your lifetime except as a polite sop granted by conquerors ... or as a sound to remember in fear.”\n“Dune,” he said.\n“You are quick!”\n“Honored Matres burned Dune.”\n“They'll do the same to us if they find us.”\n“Not if I’m your Bashar!” The words were out of him without thought but, once spoken, he felt they might have some truth. Library accounts said the Bashar had made enemies tremble just by appearing on a battlefield.\nAs though she knew what he was thinking, Odrade said: “The Bashar Teg was just as famous for creating situations where no battle was necessary.”\n“But he fought your enemies.”\n“Never forget Dune, Miles. He died there.”\n“I know.”\n“Do the Proctors have you studying Caladan yet?”\n“Yes. It’s called Dan in my histories.”\n“Labels, Miles. Names are interesting reminders but most people don’t make other connections. Boring history, eh?\nNames—convenient pointers, useful mostly with your own kind?”\n“Are you my kind?” It was a question that plagued him but not in those words until this instant.\n“We are Atreides, you and I. Remember that when you return to your study of Caladan.”\nWhen they went back through the orchards and across a pasture to the vantage knoll with its limb-framed view of Central, Teg saw the administrative complex and its barrier plantations with new sensitivity. He held this close as they went down the fenced lane to the arch into First Street.\n“A living jewel,” Odrade called Central.\nAs they passed under it, he looked up at the street name burned into the entrance arch. Galach in an elegant script with flowing lines, Bene Gesserit decorative. All streets and buildings were labeled in that same cursive.\nLooking around him at Central, the dancing fountain in the square ahead of them, the elegant details, he sensed a depth of human experience. The Bene Gesserit had made this place supportive in ways he did not quite fathom. Things picked up in studies and orchard excursions, simple things and complex, came to new focus. It was a latent Mentat reponse but he did not know this, only sensing that his unfailing memory had shifted some relationships and reorganized them. He stopped suddenly and looked back the way they had come—the orchard out there framed in the arch of the covered street. It was all related. Central’s effluent produced methane and fertilizer. (He had toured the plant with a Proctor.) Methane ran pumps and powered some of the refrigeration.\n“What are you looking at, Miles?”\nHe did not know how to answer. But he remembered an autumn afternoon when Odrade had taken him over Central in a ‘thopter to tell him about these relationships and give him “the overview.” Only words then but now the words had meaning.\n“AS near to a closed ecological circle as we can create,” Odrade had said in the ‘thopter. “Weather Control’s orbiters monitor it and order the flow lines.”\n“Why are you standing there looking at the orchard, Miles?” Her voice was full of imperatives against which he had no defenses.\n“In the ornithopter, you said it was beautiful but dangerous.”\nThey had taken only one ‘thopter trip together. She caught the reference immediately. “The ecological circle.”\nHe turned and looked up at her, waiting.\n“Enclosed,” she said. “How tempting it is to raise high walls and keep out change. Rot here in our own self-satisfied comfort.”\nHer words filled him with disquiet. He felt he had heard them before .. . some other place with a different woman holding his hand.\n“Enclosures of any kind are a fertile breeding ground for hatred of outsiders,” she said. “That produces a bitter harvest.”\nNot exactly the same words but the same lesson.\nHe walked slowly beside Odrade, his hand sweaty in hers.\n“Why are you so silent, Miles?”\n“You're farmers,” he said. “That’s really what you Bene Gesserit do.”\nShe saw immediately what had happened, Mentat training coming out in him without his knowing. Best not explore that yet. “We are concerned about everything that grows, Miles. It was perceptive of you to see this.”\nAs they parted, she to return to her tower, he to his quarters in the school section, Odrade said: “I will tell your Proctors to place more emphasis on subtle uses of power.”\nHe misunderstood. “I’m already training with lasguns. They say I’m very good.”\n“So I’ve heard. But there are weapons you cannot hold in your hands. You can only hold them in your mind.”\nRules build up fortifications behind which small minds create satrapies. A perilous state of affairs in the best of times, disastrous during crises.\n—BENE GESSERIT CODA\ntygian blackness in Great Honored Matre’s sleeping\nchamber. Logno, a Grand Dame and senior aide to the High One, entered from the unlighted hallway as she had been summoned to do and, seeing darkness, shuddered. These consultations with no illumination terrified her and she knew Great Honored Matre took pleasure from that. It could not be the only reason for darkness, though. Was Great Honored Matre fearful of attack? Several High Ones had been deposed in bed. No... not just that, although it might bear on the choice of setting.\nGrunts and moans in the darkness.\nSome Honored Matres snickered and said Great Honored Matre dared bed a Futar. Logno thought it possible. This Great Honored Matre dared many things. Had she not salvaged some of The Weapon from the disaster of the Scattering? Futars, though? The Sisters knew Futars could not be bonded by sex. At least not by sex with humans. That might be the way the Enemies of Many Faces did it, though. Who knew?\nThere was a furry smell in the bedchamber. Logno closed the door behind her and waited. Great Honored Matre did not like to be interrupted in whatever she did there within Shielding blackness. But she permits me to call her Dama.\nAnother moan, then: “Sit on the floor, Logno. Yes, there by the door.”\nDoes she really see me or only guess?\nLogno did not have the courage to test it. Poison. l'II get her that way someday. She’s cautious but she can be distracted. Although her Sisters might sneer at it, poison was an accepted tool of succession... provided the successor possessed further ways to maintain ascendancy.\n“Logno, those Ixians you spoke with today. What do they say of The Weapon?”\n“They do not understand its function, Dama. | did not tell them what it was.”\n“Of course not.”\n“Will you suggest again that Weapon and Charge be united?”\n“Are you sneering at me, Logno?”\n“Dama! | would never do such a thing.”\n“I hope not.”\nSilence. Logno understood that they both considered the same problem. Only three hundred units of The Weapon survived the disaster. Each could be used only once, provided the Council (which held the Charge) agreed to arm them. Great Honored Matre, controlling The Weapon itself, had only half of that awful power. Weapon without Charge was merely a small black tube that could be held\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SISTERHOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood is a powerful and ancient organization that acts as stewards of the land and maintains deep ecological and philosophical knowledge\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODRADE<|>PERSON<|>Odrade is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who teaches Miles about the Sisterhood's stewardship and ecological relationships\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILES TEG<|>PERSON<|>Miles Teg is a young student being taught by Odrade, showing signs of latent Mentat abilities and a deep connection to the Bene Gesserit\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>Chapterhouse is a planet where the Bene Gesserit have established a deep ecological and symbiotic relationship, serving as their current home\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune is a former planet of great importance to the Bene Gesserit, destroyed by the Honored Matres\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALADAN<|>GEO<|>Caladan, also known as Dan, is a historical planet connected to the Atreides lineage\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL<|>GEO<|>Central is the administrative complex on Chapterhouse, designed as a near-closed ecological circle\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>PERSON<|>The Great Honored Matre is a powerful and feared leader of the Honored Matres, known for her ruthless tactics and control over The Weapon\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGN<|>PERSON<|>Logno is a senior aide to the Great Honored Matre, involved in political and strategic discussions\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONORED MATRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Honored Matres are a violent and expansionist group that opposes the Bene Gesserit and has destroyed planets like Dune\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE WEAPON<|>EVENT<|>The Weapon is a powerful and feared device controlled by the Honored Matres, with limited remaining units\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ODRADE<|>SISTERHOOD<|>Odrade is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, teaching its principles to Miles Teg<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>ODRADE<|>Miles Teg is being taught by Odrade about the Bene Gesserit's ecological and philosophical teachings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILES TEG<|>SISTERHOOD<|>Miles Teg is a student of the Bene Gesserit, showing potential as a Mentat and future leader<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAPTERHOUSE<|>SISTERHOOD<|>Chapterhouse is the current home planet of the Bene Gesserit, where they practice deep ecological stewardship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNE<|>SISTERHOOD<|>Dune was a planet of great importance to the Bene Gesserit, destroyed by the Honored Matres<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNE<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Honored Matres burned Dune, marking a key conflict with the Bene Gesserit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Great Honored Matre leads the Honored Matres with ruthless control<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGN<|>GREAT HONORED MATRE<|>Logno is a senior aide to the Great Honored Matre, involved in political maneuvering<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE WEAPON<|>HONORED MATRES<|>The Honored Matres control The Weapon, a powerful and feared device<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALADAN<|>MILES TEG<|>Caladan is part of Miles Teg's historical studies, connected to his Atreides lineage<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
