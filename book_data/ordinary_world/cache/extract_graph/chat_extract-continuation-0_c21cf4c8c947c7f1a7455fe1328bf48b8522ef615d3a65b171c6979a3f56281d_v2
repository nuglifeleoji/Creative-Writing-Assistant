\n　　田晓霞心绪极其纷乱，一时无心回家去。 \n　　她索性离开地委大门口，来到了街道上。她在人行道梧桐树下的暗影里，慢慢地遛达着，情不自禁向北走去。说来奇怪，她怀着某种侥幸，希望孙少平还能在这条路上转回来。她现在才觉得，她和少平两年后第一次相遇，几乎没有交谈多少。他倒说了一些，她几乎没说什么。唉，实际上，她刚看见少平时，感到又陌生又震惊，简直顾不上说什么！是的，孙少平已经变了，变得让她几乎都认不出来了。这倒不是说他的模样变了——模样的确也变了，但主要的变化并不是他的外表。 \n　　师专以后，本来她已经习惯于同周围的那些男男女女相处。她认为自己也告别了过去的生活，开始了人生的一个新阶段。尽管她仍然保持着自己的个性，但基本上和新的环境融为一体。过去的一切，包括中学时期的朋友，渐渐地开始淡忘；而将自己的生活迅速地投入到另外一个天地。国家在多少年禁锢以后，许多似乎天经地义的观念一个个被推倒；新的思潮象洪水一般涌来，令人目不暇接。她整天兴奋地沉醉于和同学们交换各种信息，辩论各种问题；回家以后，又和父母亲唇枪舌战一番。她周围的青年，一个个都是以天下为己任的雄辩家；古今中外，旁征博引，思想一个比一个解放，幻想一个比一个高远，对社会流弊的抨击一个比一个猛烈。他们学习刻苦钻研，吃穿日新月异，玩起来又痛快淋漓……可是，她猛然间发现了另外一种类型的同龄人。 \n　　孙少平和过去有什么不同？从外表看，他脸色严峻，粗胳膊壮腿，已经是一副十足的男子汉架式。他仍然象中学时那样忧郁，衣服也和那时一样破烂。但是，和过去不同的是，他已经开始独立地生活，独立地思考，并且选择了一条艰难的奋斗之路。说实话，尽管她以前对这个人另眼相看，认为他身上有许多不一般的东西，但上大学后，她似乎认定，孙少平最终不会逃脱大多数农村学生的命运：建家立业，生儿育女，在广阔天地自得其乐。现在农村政策宽了，象少平这样的人，在农民中间肯定是出类拔萃的人物，说不定会发家致富，成为村民们羡慕不已的“冒尖户”。记得高中毕业时，她还对他说过，希望他千万不能变成个世俗的农民，满嘴说的都是吃，肩膀上搭着个褡裢，在石圪节街上瞅着买个便宜猪娃……为此，在少平回村的那两年\n######################\nOutput:",
