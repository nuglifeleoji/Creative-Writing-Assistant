We have thousands of such\ncaches. Only a few of us know them all.” He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow- Shadowed glow across face and beard. “Hear that?”\nThey listened.\nThe dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.\nTo Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing through him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move.\n“It has been calculated with precision,” Stilgar whispered. “We know to within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis.”\nA hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: “Bi-lal kaifa.”\n“We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings,” Stilgar said, his voice growing stronger. “We will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.\n“Each year the polar ice retreats,” Stilgar said.\n“Bi-lal kaifa,” they chanted.\n“We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis—with melting lenses at the poles, with lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the maker and his spice.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa.”\n“And no man ever again shall want for water. It Shall be his for dipping from well or pond or lake or\ncanal. It shall run down through the qanats to feed our plants. It shall be there for any man to take. It Shall be his for holding out his hand.”\n“Bi-lal kaifa.”\nJessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively awed response. They're in league with the future, she thought. They have their mountain to climb. This is the scientist’s dream...and these simple people, these peasants, are filled with it.\nHer thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor’s planetary ecologist, the man who had gone native— and she wondered at him. This was a dream to capture men’s souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it. This was a dream for which men would die willingly. It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul’s place for him.\n“We leave now,” Stilgar said, “and wait for the first moon’s rising. When Jamis is safely on his way, we will go home.”\nWhispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along the water barrier and up the stairs.\nAnd Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him, that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth. He knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a fragment of prescient dream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place were being filled in now that he had not seen. He felt a new\nsense of wonder at the limits of his gift. It was as though he rode within the wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on a crest—and all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then hiding what they bore on their surface.\nThrough it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence and the slaughter. It was like a promontory above the surf.\nThe troop filed through the last door into the main cavern. The door was sealed. Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern openings, revealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert.\nJessica moved to the dry lip of the cavern’s edge, looked up at the stars. They were sharp and near. She felt the stirring of the troop around her, heard the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her, and Paul’s voice humming the pitch. There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like.\nChant’s voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: “Tell me about the waters of your birthworld, Paul-Muad’Dib.”\nAnd Paul: “Another time, Chani. | promise.”\nSuch sadness.\n“It’s a good baliset,” Chani said.\n“Very good,” Paul said. “Do you think Jamis’II mind my using it?”\nHe speaks of the dead in the present tense, Jessica thought. The implications disturbed her.\nA man’s voice intruded: “He liked music betimes, Jamis did.”\n“Then sing me one of your songs,” Chani pleaded.\nSuch feminine allure in that girl-child’s voice, Jessica thought. / must caution Paul about their women...and soon.\n“This was a song of a friend of mine,” Paul said. “l expect he’s dead now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong.”\nThe troop grew still, listening as Paul’s voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:\n“This clear time of seeing embers—\nA gold-bright sun’s lost in first dusk. What frenzied senses, desp’rate musk Are consort of rememb’ring.”\nJessica felt the verbal music in her breast—pagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.\n“Night’s pearl-censered requi-em... ‘Tis for us!\nWhat joys run, then—\nBright in your eyes—\nWhat flower-spangled amores\nPull at our hearts...\nWhat flower-spangled amores\nFill our desires.”\nAnd Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last note. Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? she asked herself. She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp on its reins. Why\ndid he choose that song? she wondered. The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?\nPaul sat silently in the darkness, a single stark thought dominating his awareness: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me. She is my enemy.\nThe concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.\n—FROM “COLLECTED SAYINGS OF MUAD'DIB” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nO n his seventeenth birthday, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen killed his one hundredth slave- gladiator in the family games. Visiting observers from the Imperial Court—a Count and Lady Fenring—were on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime for the event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden box above the triangular arena.\nIn honor of the na-Baron’s nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and subjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime. The old Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from labors, and effort had been spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of gaiety: banners flew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the walls along Court Way.\nBut off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps, the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the furtive scurrying of the people.\nIn the Baron’s blue-walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the Count and his lady saw the price being paid—guards everywhere and weapons with that special sheen that told a trained eye they were\nin regular use. There were checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep. The servants revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of their shoulders...in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.\n“The pressure’s on,” the Count hummed to his lady in their secret language. “The Baron Is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of the Duke Leto.”\n“Sometime | must recount for you the legend of the phoenix,” she said.\nThey were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family games. It was not a large hall— perhaps forty meters long and half that in width—but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper, and the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater space.\n“Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron,” the Count said.\nThe Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddling-glide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor-hung weight. His jowls bobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe. Rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into the robe.\nAt the Baron’s elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in close ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes. He wore a tight-fitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom. Soft-soled slippers covered his small feet.\nLady Fenring, noting the young man’s poise and the sure flow of muscles beneath the tunic, thought: Here’s one who won't let himself go to fat.\nThe Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd- Rautha’s arm in a possessive grip, said, “My nephew, the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.” And, turning his baby-fat face toward Feyd-Rautha, he said, “The Count and Lady Fenring of whom I've spoken.”\nFeyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the Lady Fenring. She was golden-haired and willowy, her perfection of figure clothed in a flowing gown of ecru—simple fitness of form without ornament. Gray-green eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene Gesserit serene repose about her that the young man found subtly disturbing.\n“Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m,” said the Count. He Studied Feyd-Rautha. “The, hm-m-m-m, precise young man, ah, my...Am-m-m-m...dear?” The Count glanced at the Baron. “My dear Baron, you say you've spoken of us to this precise young man? What did you say?”\n“I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you, Count Fenring,” the Baron said. And he thought: Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the manners of a rabbit—this is the most dangerous kind.\n“Of course!” said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.\nFeyd-Rautha found the man’s actions and words almost insulting. They stopped just short of something overt that would require notice. The young\nman focused his attention on the Count: a small man, weak-looking. The face was weaselish with overlarge dark eyes. There was gray at the temples. And his movements—he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way. It was difficult to follow.\n“Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you come upon such, mm-m-m, preciseness so rarely,” the Count said, addressing the Baron’s shoulder. “I...ah, congratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the light of the hm-m-m elder, one might say.”\n“You are too kind,” the Baron said. He bowed,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_098403f3a22efe10a496ca04eababa0d867c525fe3c852c7a74189d41d6df9be_v2"}
