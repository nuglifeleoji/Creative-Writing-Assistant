Historically, they are remembered for their oppressive rule over **Giedi Prime (Gammu)**, where they engaged in slavery and cruelty, leaving a dark legacy that persists in cultural memory. Their seat of power, the **Barony**, is located in **Ysai**, and their influence has contributed to the chaotic state of regions like **Gammu**.  \n\nThe Harkonnens are primary antagonists in the conflict for control of **Arrakis**, the desert planet rich in the valuable spice **melange**. They orchestrated the **attack on Arrakeen**, leading to the death of **Duke Leto Atreides**, and were responsible for the **betrayal and capture of Jessica and Paul Atreides**. Their rule over Arrakis is marked by exploitation and oppression, making them bitter enemies of the **Fremen** and **Liet-Kynes**, whom they wounded and later killed.  \n\nLed by the cunning and sadistic **Baron Vladimir Harkonnen**, the family employs **mercenaries, advanced weaponry (including lasguns), and deceitful tactics**, such as disguising their forces as Fremen. They are also implicated in political machinations, including infiltrating rival factions and manipulating events to weaken the Atreides.  \n\nThough ultimately defeated by **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)** during the **Jihad**, their legacy of cruelty and ambition endures. Their remnants and influence linger in historical accounts, no-globes, and the collective memory of those who suffered under their rule.

Primarily known for its monopoly over the spice melange from Arrakis, CHOAM wields immense influence, with its directorships determining wealth and power among noble Houses. The company operates as a commercial empire under the oversight of the Emperor, though its control was later stripped by Paul Atreides as part of a political maneuver.  \n\nCHOAM’s economic dominance extends beyond spice trade, encompassing broader commerce in the Known Universe. Its banners and flags serve as political symbols, even used by the Emperor to signal authority. The company’s presence is marked by its proximity to powerful factions, such as the Harkonnens, with the Baron himself holding a directorship, underscoring its role in inter-House politics.  \n\nAs the primary entity regulating trade and resources, CHOAM is integral to the Imperium’s stability, making it a focal point of power struggles. Its control over the spice melange—a substance critical for space travel, longevity, and prescience—cements its unrivaled economic and strategic importance. In summary, CHOAM Company is a linchpin of commerce, politics, and power in the Dune universe, with its influence permeating every level of the Imperium.\",9\n216,WATER PEDDLERS UNION,\"Group controlling water distribution on Arrakis\nThe Water Peddlers Union is a group involved in the water trade on Arrakis, advised by the banker\",2\n71,SALUSA SECUNDUS,\"**Salusa Secundus** is a historically significant and harsh planet, serving as the ancestral homeworld of **House Corrino** and the original training ground for the elite **Sardaukar** troops. Known for its brutal conditions, it has been compared to **Arrakis** in severity and was historically used as an **Imperial prison planet**, where political exiles, including **Shaddam IV** and **Count Fenring**, were sent. The planet’s unforgiving environment made it an ideal location for military conditioning, and it is suspected to have been a secret training site for the Sardaukar, who were renowned for their ferocity.  \n\nUnder **Farad’n Corrino**, Salusa Secundus became the **restored seat of House Corrino**, where he ruled and rebuilt the Sardaukar. The planet features **enclosed gardens** and a **golden sun**, contrasting with its otherwise barren landscape. It was here that **Jessica Atreides** reportedly taught Farad’n, though conflicting accounts suggest she may have been a prisoner at some point, as indicated by **Namri**.  \n\nSalusa Secundus also holds cultural and religious significance, as it is one of the few places where the **Tawrah** and **Talmudic Zabur** texts survived. Additionally, it was a site of political intrigue, with **Princess Wensicia** and **Tyekanik** plotting there, and where **The Preacher** was active. The planet was occasionally referenced in military contexts, such as when **Irulan’s father** conducted landing maneuvers with his legions, raising concerns about potential threats.  \n\nOnce a **prison world** for the Imperium, Salusa Secundus later transitioned into a **political stronghold** for House Corrino, though its legacy as a place of exile and punishment persisted. It remains a key location in the power struggles of the universe, tied to both military might and dynastic ambitions.\",12\n42,SARDAUKAR,\"The **Sardaukar** are the elite military force of the Padishah Emperor, renowned for their brutal efficiency, unwavering loyalty to House Corrino, and fearsome combat prowess. Trained under oppressive conditions on the prison planet **Salusa Secundus**, they are among the most feared warriors in the Imperium, serving as the Emperor's personal enforcers. Historically, they have been deployed in critical conflicts, including covert operations disguised as **Harkonnen** troops during the attack on **House Atreides**, where they played a key role in **Duke Leto Atreides'** capture and **Duncan Idaho's** death in a past life.  \n\nTheir reputation for ruthlessness is well-documented—they have been involved in the deaths of prominent figures such as **Chani and Paul's firstborn**, as well as an earlier **Leto** mentioned in religious texts. Despite their elite status, the Sardaukar have faced significant defeats, particularly at the hands of **Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib)** and the **Fremen**, who overwhelmed them in battles such as the **Plains of Arrakeen** and **Habbanya Ridge**. These losses marked a decline in their dominance, though remnants remained under **House Corrino's** control, including figures like **Farad’n** and **Tyekanik**, who sought to revive their old ways.  \n\nWhile their primary allegiance lies with the **Padishah Emperor**, the Sardaukar have also been used as a political tool, aiding the **Harkonnens** in their schemes and enforcing Imperial will across the Great Houses. Their involvement in covert missions, such as the disguised assault on **Arrakis**, underscores their adaptability and strategic importance. However, their once-unassailable power waned as **Paul's Fremen forces** and shifting allegiances reshaped the Imperium.  \n\nIn summary, the Sardaukar are a legendary but declining military order—brutal, disciplined, and fiercely loyal, yet ultimately vulnerable to the rise of new powers like the Fremen. Their legacy endures as both a symbol of Imperial might and a cautionary tale of overreach and defeat.\",48\n16,PADISHAH EMPEROR,\"**Summary of the Padishah Emperor (Shaddam IV):**  \n\nThe Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV is the supreme ruler of the Imperium and the known universe during the events of *Dune*, wielding immense political and military power. As the leader of the Imperium, he plays a central role in the galaxy's power struggles, particularly in the conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen. Fearing the growing influence of Duke Leto Atreides, the Emperor conspires with the Harkonnens to orchestrate House Atreides' downfall, secretly providing Sardaukar forces—his elite soldier-fanatics—to ensure their victory.  \n\nShaddam IV maintains a rare camaraderie with Count Hasimir Fenring, a trusted advisor, and relies on his Truthsayer, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, to navigate political intrigues. His rule is marked by manipulation and subterfuge; he stockpiles the valuable spice melange to consolidate power and views skilled individuals like Thufir Hawat, the Atreides' Mentat, as potential threats.  \n\nThe Emperor's military might is evident when he arrives above Arrakis with his Sardaukar legions, reoccupying the planet to secure his interests. Though he presents himself as a neutral arbiter, his actions reveal a ruthless strategist who pits the Great Houses against each other to maintain dominance. Ultimately, Shaddam IV is a key antagonist whose machinations drive much of *Dune*'s political conflict, embodying the Imperium's oppressive and calculating nature.  \n\n(Word count: 220)\",11\n214,BANKER,The banker is a Guild Bank representative suspected to be a Harkonnen agent with Giedi Prime speech patterns,6\n399,ARRAKIS AFFAIR,\"**The Arrakis Affair** was a significant political crisis on the desert planet Arrakis, involving key factions such as **House Atreides**, **House Harkonnen**, **Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)**, and the **Bene Gesserit**. The event sparked widespread suspicion within the **Landsraad**, the imperial feudal council, due to its destabilizing implications for power dynamics in the Known Universe.  \n\nThe conflict arose from tensions between **House Atreides** and **House Harkonnen**, two rival noble houses vying for control over Arrakis and its invaluable spice resources. The involvement of **Muad'Dib**, the messianic figure central to Fremen prophecy, further escalated the affair, as his rise challenged both the Harkonnens and the Bene Gesserit's secretive plans. The **Bene Gesserit**, a powerful sisterhood with deep political influence, played a covert role in the events, though their exact motives remain ambiguous.  \n\nTo mitigate the crisis and prevent broader unrest, **Count Fenring**, a trusted advisor to Emperor Shaddam IV, intervened by orchestrating a resolution through bribes and gifts to key members of the Landsraad. This diplomatic maneuvering helped quell immediate tensions, though the underlying rivalries and Muad'Dib's growing influence ensured lasting repercussions.  \n\nThe **Arrakis Affair** thus stands as a pivotal moment in the power struggles over Arrakis, blending political intrigue, factional conflict, and the machinations of secretive organizations. Its resolution through Fenring's intervention temporarily stabilized the situation but foreshadowed the larger upheavals to come in the Imperium.\",3\n492,PRINCESS ROYAL,\"The Emperor's daughter who is to be married to Paul as part of the political settlement.\"\"\",2\n247,ATTACK ON ATREIDES,The attack is a coordinated assault by the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to eliminate the Atreides family,2\n276,ATTACK ON ARRAKIS,A large-scale assault by Harkonnen and Sardaukar forces on House Atreides>,2\n449,CAPTAIN ARAMSHAM,\"**Captain Aramsham** is an Imperial Sardaukar officer known for his loyalty to the Emperor and his role in opposing Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib. Tasked with eliminating Muad'Dib and his followers, Aramsham was eventually captured by Paul and the Fedaykin during their conflict. Despite his capture, he initially resisted Paul's authority, demonstrating his unwavering allegiance to the Emperor. As a high-ranking Sardaukar, Aramsham embodies the fierce discipline and combat prowess characteristic of the Emperor's elite forces. His capture highlights the shifting power dynamics as Paul challenges Imperial dominance. The descriptions collectively portray Aramsham as a formidable adversary, bound by duty and loyalty, even in defeat.\",2\n614,HABBANYA RIDGE,\"**Habbanya Ridge** is a prominent geographical feature on the desert planet Arrakis, known for its significance in Fremen history and its role as a landmark in the planet's vast desert landscape. Located eastward from Sietch Tabr, the ridge is home to the Cave of Birds, a notable site within its terrain. It served as the backdrop for key historical events, including encounters between the Fremen and the Sardaukar, as well as the rise of Muad’Dib.  \n\nThe ridge is also referenced in later accounts, such as during the journey of Siona and Leto II, where it appears as a distant landmark. Additionally, Habbanya Ridge is mentioned in the context of Leto II's visions, further underscoring its enduring presence in the cultural and physical geography of Arrakis.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its historical importance, others highlight its role as a geographical reference point, but these perspectives are complementary rather than contradictory. Collectively, they paint a cohesive picture of Habbanya Ridge as both a strategic location in Fremen history and a defining feature of Arrakis' desert environment.\",2\n205,ESCORT SERVICE,\"A front for smuggling and espionage operations, posing as a service for off-planet visitors.\"\"\",1\n237,CAPTURE OF JESSICA AND PAUL,\"The event where Jessica and Paul are captured by the Harkonnens through betrayal and deception, leading to their planned execution.\"\"\",1\n284,ATTACK ON ARRAKEEN,\"The attack on Arrakeen is the event where House Harkonnen, with the aid of the Sardaukar, destroys House Atreides' base, killing Duke Leto and forcing Paul and Jessica to flee.\"\"\",1\n55,EMPEROR,,28\n451,IMPERIAL SERVICE,\"The Imperial service refers to the Sardaukar and other forces loyal to the Padishah Emperor.\"\"\",1\n489,IMPERIAL CREST,,1\n502,KULON,\"Domesticated desert asses used by smugglers, representing a logistical event>\",1\n1764,SHIELDING,\"Shielding refers to Harkonnen protective technology mentioned in Duncan's memories.\"\"\",1\n471,BATTLE OF ARRAKEEN,\"The **Battle of Arrakeen** was a pivotal and climactic conflict in the history of the Fremen and the Imperium, marking a decisive turning point in the rise of Paul Atreides, also known as Paul-Muad'Dib. Under Paul's leadership, the Fremen, including notable figures like Korba, united to challenge the forces of the Padishah Emperor and his elite Sardaukar troops. The battle culminated in a resounding victory for the Fremen, securing Paul's ascension to power and the downfall of the Emperor's dominance.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to the battle as \"\"impending,\"\" suggesting it was an anticipated confrontation, the prevailing consensus is that it was a historical event where the Fremen achieved a definitive triumph over Imperial forces. The conflict solidified Paul's position as a messianic figure among the Fremen and reshaped the political landscape of the known universe. The Battle of Arrakeen is thus remembered as the moment when the Fremen, through superior tactics and unwavering loyalty to Paul-Muad'Dib, overcame the might of the Sardaukar and the Emperor's forces, establishing a new era under Paul's rule.  \n\nIn summary, the Battle of Arrakeen was a transformative military engagement where Paul-Muad'Dib and the Fremen emerged victorious against the Emperor, marking the end of Imperial hegemony and the beginning of Paul's reign. The descriptions collectively emphasize its significance as the decisive clash that altered the course of history.\",9\n671,PLAINS OF ARRAKEEN,\"The **Plains of Arrakeen** is a historically significant location on the desert planet **Arrakis**, renowned as the site of pivotal battles that shaped the planet's destiny. It is most famously recognized as the battleground where **Paul Muad'Dib**, the prophesied leader of the Fremen, achieved a decisive victory over the imperial **Sardaukar** forces. This triumph marked a turning point in the struggle for control of Arrakis and solidified Paul's rise to power.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize the broader role of the **Fremen** in defeating the Sardaukar, others specifically attribute the victory to **Paul Muad'Dib**, highlighting his leadership in the conflict. These accounts are not contradictory but rather complementary, as Paul's success was intrinsically tied to the Fremen's collective strength and guerrilla tactics. The Plains of Arrakeen thus stand as a symbol of resistance and strategic brilliance, forever etched in the history of Arrakis as the place where imperial dominance was challenged and overthrown.  \n\nIn summary, the **Plains of Arrakeen** are a legendary battlefield where the combined forces of the Fremen, led by **Paul Muad'Dib**, secured a monumental victory against the Sardaukar, altering the course of Arrakis' future.\",2\n219,SOO-SOO,\"Nickname of the banker, referencing his role with the Water Peddlers Union\",1\n220,STILLSUIT MANUFACTURER'S DAUGHTER,\"Young woman seated near Paul, prompting the banker's remarks\",1\n1798,BARONY,\"**BARONY** is a sprawling city on the planet Gammu, historically known as the ancient Harkonnen seat and now referred to as Ysai.

At its heart lies a massive black rectangular structure made of plasteel, a remnant of the Harkonnen era, which serves as a stark centerpiece amidst the city's chaotic expanse. This imposing edifice, often a symbol of the Harkonnens' oppressive legacy, evokes strong emotions, including hatred from figures such as Duncan Idaho. Despite its modern developments, Barony retains its historical significance as both an organizing landmark and a reminder of the planet's tumultuous past under Harkonnen rule.

In their efforts to undermine the **Fremen**, the **Harkonnens** employ deceptive tactics, including disguising mercenaries as **Fremen** and attempting to acquire **crysknives**—sacred blades unique to the **Fremen**—to infiltrate their communities.
