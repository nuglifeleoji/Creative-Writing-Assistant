\n　　少安白了弟弟一眼，嫌他出了这么一个不吉利的主意。少平赶忙笑着改口说：“干脆说奶奶病了！反正她老人家一年四季都有病！” \n　　少安也笑了。他踌躇了半天，终于决定听从弟弟的劝告，准备半路回头了。 \n　　这样商定后，他们都似乎有一种轻松感，于是便开始拉谈双水村的事。他们的兴致高昂起来。少安详细对弟弟描绘了村里的“吃鱼事件”和金光亮蜂跑走的情况；两个人说一阵笑一阵。最后，又谈到了少平的婚姻问题。少安只是传达了老人们的愿望。少平说让他们不要操心，他的事由他自己解决…… \n　　孙少安觉得，这一夜过得很愉快。是的，每次他都能从弟弟这里受到许多启发。虽然他是兄长，但他尊重自己的弟弟。真象少平说的，他们已经成了“朋友”！ \n　　第二天早晨，当胡永合听少安说他因为祖母突然病重要返回家时，气得嘴张了半天，不知该说什么是好。既然是这样，他总不能把这个孙少安用绳子捆到省城去！ \n　　孙少平这样还不放心，又一直把他们送到铜城，直看着胡永合上了南去的火车而哥哥上了北返的汽车后，他自己才回到大牙湾。 \n                  第50章\n　　秋末冬初，地里的庄稼收割完毕，禾场上的活路也随之结束，庄稼人便渐渐消闲下来。 \n　　山野里绿色褪尽，裸露的大地重新变得荒凉起来。庙坪的枣林显出了一片严峻的铁黑，枝头挑挂着稀疏的黄叶，东拉河的水流却到了旺季，朗朗在喧响着，把潮湿的凉气扩散到了东西两岸。 \n　　早晨，地上已经开始结霜。只是在接近中午的时候，天气才暖和那么一会。大部分农人的棉衣都上了身。 \n　　这时候，有些人即是没什么买卖，也要到石圪节或米家镇的街头去溜达一圈。更多的人闲着没事，就三五成群蹲在村子各处的阳崖根下说闲话。近一两年不象责任制刚开始，人们都忙于改变自己的穷光景，谁也顾不上找别人说闲话；经过几年的拼命劳作，大部分人家都有了些存粮，因此在冬闲的时候有时间凑到一块说说古朝今世了。 \n　　双水村各处的“闲话中心”又都自然地恢复。要是闲话说得有了兴致，大家还会凑着拿几升软小米，割几斤羊肉，“打平伙”吃一顿小米羊肉丁子饭。另有一些爱红火热闹的人，等不到正月里闹秧歌，现在就聚在一块吹拉弹唱，闹得不亦乐乎；某些�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
