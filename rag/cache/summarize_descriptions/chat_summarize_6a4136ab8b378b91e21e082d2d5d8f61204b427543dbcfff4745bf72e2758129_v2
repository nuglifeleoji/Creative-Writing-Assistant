This method involves the cultivation of gholas—genetically identical clones—from the cells of deceased individuals, grown within specialized axlotl tanks. A prominent example is the resurrection of Duncan Idaho, whose ghola, Hayt, played a significant role in the political and personal affairs of Paul Atreides and House Atreides.  \n\nThe process is not limited to a single resurrection; cells from multiple Idaho gholas were reportedly mixed to recreate Duncan, demonstrating the Tleilaxu's advanced mastery over genetic manipulation. The implications of ghola creation remain uncertain, particularly for the Bene Gesserit, who view the practice with suspicion due to its potential to disrupt power dynamics and challenge their own genetic programs.  \n\nGholas like Duncan Idaho and Hayt represent more than mere biological reconstructions—they carry the memories and identities of their original selves, raising ethical and existential questions. The Tleilaxu's ability to produce gholas has far-reaching consequences, both politically and personally, as seen in the tensions surrounding Hayt's reintroduction into the Atreides fold.  \n\nIn summary, ghola creation is a pivotal and enigmatic Tleilaxu technology, blending science, resurrection, and subterfuge, with Duncan Idaho's case standing as one of its most notable and consequential applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751251796, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 312, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 669, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 293}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
