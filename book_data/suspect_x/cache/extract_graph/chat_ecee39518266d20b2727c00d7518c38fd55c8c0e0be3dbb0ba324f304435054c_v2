A disgruntled servant! She did not like what she saw.\nWe are too tightly bound up in our difficulties, almost incapable of separating petty problems from great ones.\nWhat had happened to their conscience?\nAlthough some denied it, Odrade knew there was a Bene Gesserit conscience. But they had twisted and reshaped it into a form not easily recognized.\nShe felt loath to meddle with it. Decisions taken in the name of survival, the Missionaria (their interminable Jesuitical arguments!)—all diverged from something far more demanding of human judgment. The Tyrant had known this.\nTo be human, that was the issue. But before you could be human, you had to feel it in your guts.\nNo clinical answers! It came down to a deceptive Simplicity whose complex nature appeared when you applied it.\nLike me.\nYou looked inward and found who and what you believed you were. Nothing else would serve.\nSo what am |?\n“Who asks that question?” It was a skewering thrust from Other Memory.\nOdrade laughed aloud and a passing Proctor named Praska stared at her in astonishment. Odrade waved to Praska and said: “It’s good to be alive. Remember that.”\nPraska produced a faint smile before going on about her business.\nSo who asks: What am I?\nDangerous question. Asking it put her in a universe where nothing was quite human. Nothing matched the undefined thing she sought. All around her, clowns, wild animals and puppets reacted to the pull of hidden strings. She sensed the strings that jerked her into movement.\nOdrade continued along the corridor toward the tube that would take her up to her quarters.\nStrings. What came with the egg? We speak glibly of “the mind at its beginning.” But what was I before the pressures of living shaped me?\nIt wasn’t enough to seek something “natural.” No “Noble Savage.” She had seen plenty of those in her lifetime. The strings jerking them were quite visible to a Bene Gesserit.\nShe felt the taskmaster within her. Strong today. It was a force she sometimes disobeyed or avoided. Taskmaster said: “Strengthen your talents. Do not flow gently in the current. Swim! Use it or lose it.”\nWith a gasping sensation of near panic, she realized she had barely retained her humanity, that she had been on the point of losing it.\nI’ve been trying too hard to think like an Honored Matre! Manipulating and maneuvering anyone I could. And all in the name of Bene Gesserit survival!\nBell said there were no limits beyond which the Sisterhood would refuse to go in preserving the Bene Gesserit. A modicum of truth in this boast but it was the\ntruth of all boasting. There were indeed things a Reverend Mother would not do to save the Sisterhood.\nWe would not block the Tyrant’s Golden Path.\nSurvival of humankind took precedence over survival of the Sisterhood. Else our grail of human maturity is meaningless.\nBut oh, the perils of leadership in a species so anxious to be told what to do. How little they knew of what they created by their demands. Leaders made mistakes. And those mistakes, amplified by the numbers who followed without questioning, moved inevitably toward great disasters.\nLemming behavior.\nIt was right that her Sisters watched her carefully. All governments needed to remain under suspicion during their time of power including that of the Sisterhood itself. Trust no government! Not even mine!\nThey are watching me this very instant. Very little escapes my Sisters. They will know my plan in time.\nIt required constant mental cleansing to face up to the fact of her great power over the Sisterhood. / did not seek this power. It was thrust upon me. And she thought: Power attracts the corruptible. Suspect all who seek it. She knew the chances were great that such people were susceptible to corruption or already lost.\nOdrade made a mental note to scribe and transmit a Coda memo to Archives. (Let Bell sweat this one!) “We should grant power over our affairs only to those who are reluctant to hold it and then only under conditions that increase the reluctance.”\nPerfect description of the Bene Gesserit!\n“Are you well, Dar?” It was Bellonda’s voice from the tube door beside Odrade. “You look... strange.”\n“I just thought of something to do. You getting off?”\nBellonda stared at her as they exchanged places. The tube-field caught Odrade and whisked her away from that\nquestioning gaze.\nOdrade entered the workroom and saw her table piled with things her aides thought only she could resolve.\nPolitics, she recalled as she sat at her table and prepared to deal with responsibilities. Tam and Bell had heard her clearly the other day but they had only the vaguest idea of what they would be asked to support. They were worried and increasingly watchful. As they should be.\nAlmost any subject had political elements, she thought. As emotions were whipped up, political forces came more and more into the foreground. This put //e/ to that old nonsense about “separation of church and state.” Nothing more susceptible to emotional heat than religion.\nNo wonder we distrust emotions.\nNot all emotions, of course. Only the ones you could not escape in moments of necessity: love, hate. Let in a little anger sometimes but keep it on a short leash. That was the Sisterhood’s belief. Utter nonsense!\nThe Tyrant’s Golden Path made their mistake no longer tolerable. The Golden Path left the Bene Gesserit in a perpetual backwater. You could not minister to Infinity!\nBell’s recurrent question had no answer. “What did he really want us to do?” /nto what actions was he manipulating us? (As we manipulate others!)\nWhy look for meaning where there is none? Would you follow a path you knew led nowhere?\nGolden Path! A track laid down in one imagination. /nfinity is nowhere! And the finite mind balked. Here was where Mentats found mutable projections, always producing more questions than answers. It was the empty grail of those who, noses close to an endless circle, looked for “the one answer to all things.”\nLooking for their own kind of god.\nShe found it hard to censure them. The mind recoiled in the face of infinity. The Void! Alchemists of any age were like\nrag pickers bent over their bundles, saying: “There must be order in here somewhere. If | keep on, I’m sure to find it.”\nAnd all the time, the only order was the order they themselves created.\nAhhh, Tyrant! You droll fellow. You saw it. You said: “I will create order for you to follow. Here is the path. See it? No! Don’t look over there. That is the way of the Emperor- Without-Clothes (a nakedness apparent only to children and the insane). Keep your attention where I direct it. This is my Golden Path. Isn't that a pretty name? It’s all there is and all there ever will be.”\nTyrant, you were another clown. Pointing us into endless recycling of cells from that lost and lonely ball of dirt in our common past.\nYou knew the human universe could never be more than communities and weak glue binding us when we Scattered. A common birth tradition so far away in our past that pictures of it carried by descendants are mostly distorted. Reverend Mothers carry the original, but we cannot force it onto unwilling people. You see, Tyrant? We heard you: “Let them come asking for it! Then, and only then...”\nAnd that was why you preserved us, you Atreides bastard! That’s why I must get to work.\nDespite the peril to her sense of humanity, she knew she would continue to insinuate herself into the ways of Honored Matres. / must think as they think.\nThe hunters’ problem: predator and prey shared it. Not quite needle-in-the-haystack. More a question of tracking across a terrain littered with the familiar and the unfamiliar. Bene Gesserit deceptions insured that the familiar would cause Honored Matres at least as much difficulty as the unfamiliar.\nBut what have they done for us?\nInterplanetary communication worked for the hunted. Limited by economics for millennia. Not much of it except among Important People and Traders. Important meant what\nit had always meant: rich, powerful; bankers, officials, couriers. Military. “Important” labeled many categories— negotiators, entertainers, medical personnel, skilled technicians, spies, and other specialists. It was not much different in kind from the days of the Master Masons on Old Terra. Mainly a difference in numbers, quality and sophistication. Boundaries were transparent to some as they had always been.\nShe felt it important to review this occasionally, looking for flaws.\nThe great mass of planet-bound humanity spoke of “the silence of space,” meaning they could not afford the cost of such travel or communication. Most people knew the news they received across this barrier was managed for special interests. It had always been that way.\nOn a planet, terrain and avoiding telltale radiation dictated the communications systems used: tubes, messengers, light-lines, nerve riders and many permutations. Secrecy and encryption were important, not only between planets but on them.\nOdrade saw it as a system Honored Matres could tap if they found an entry point. Hunters had to begin by deciphering the system, but then: Where did a trail to Chapterhouse originate?\nUntrackable no-ships, Ixian machines, and Guild Navigators—all contributed to the blanket of silence between planets except for the privileged few. Give hunters no starting points!\nIt came as a Surprise then when an aging Reverend Mother from a Bene Gesserit punishment planet appeared at Mother Superior’s workroom shortly before the lunch break. Archives identified her: Name: Dortujla. Sent to special perdition years ago for an unforgivable infraction. Memory said it had been a love affair of some kind. Odrade did not ask for details. Some of them were displayed anyway. (Bellonda interfering again!) Emotional upheaval at\nthe time of Dortujla’s banishment, Odrade noted. Futile attempts by the lover to prevent separation.\nOdrade recalled gossip about Dortujla’s disgrace. “The Jessica crime!” Much valuable information arrived via gossip. Where the devil had Dortujla been posted? Never mind. Not important at the moment. More important: Why is she here? Why did she dare a trip that might lead the hunters to us?\nOdrade asked Streggi when she announced the arrival. Streggi did not know. “She says what she must reveal is for your ears alone, Mother Superior.”\n“Alone?” Odrade almost chuckled, considering the constant monitoring (surveillance was a better term) of her every action. “This Dortujla has not said why she is here?”\n“The ones who told me to interrupt you, Mother Superior, said they thought you should see her.”\nOdrade pursed her lips. The fact that the banished Reverend Mother had penetrated this far aroused Odrade’s curiosity. A persistent Reverend Mother could cross ordinary barriers but these barriers were not ordinary. Dortujla’s reason for coming already had been told. Others had heard and passed her. It was apparent that Dortujla had not relied on Bene Gesserit wiles to persuade her Sisters. That would have brought immediate rejection. No time for such nonsense! So she had observed the chain of command. Her action spoke of careful assessment, a message within whatever message she brought.\n“Bring her.”\nDortujla had aged smoothly on her backwater planet. She revealed her years mostly in shallow wrinkles around her mouth. The hood of her robe concealed her hair but the eyes peering from beneath it were bright\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ecee39518266d20b2727c00d7518c38fd55c8c0e0be3dbb0ba324f304435054c_v2"}
