�西将军陈泰，一路是兖州刺史邓艾。”维大惊，遂请夏侯霸商议。霸曰：“吾向尝为将军言：邓艾自幼深明兵法，善晓地理。今领兵到，颇为劲敌。”维曰：“彼军远来，我休容他住脚，便可击之。”乃留张翼攻城，命夏侯霸引兵迎陈泰。维自引兵来迎邓艾。行不到五里，忽然东南一声炮响，鼓角震地，火光冲天。维纵马看时，只见周围皆是魏兵旗号。维大惊曰：“中邓艾之计矣！”遂传令教夏侯霸、张翼各弃狄道而退。于是蜀兵皆退于汉中。维自断后，只听得背后鼓声不绝，维退入剑阁之时，方知火鼓二十余处，皆虚设也。维收兵退屯于钟提。\n\n    且说后主因姜维有洮西之功，降诏封维为大将军。维受了职，上表谢恩毕，再议出师伐魏之策。正是：成功不必添蛇足，讨贼犹思奋虎威。不知此番北伐如何，且看下文分解。\n\n\n\n第一百十一回　邓士载智败姜伯约　诸葛诞义讨司马昭\n\n    \t\t\n\n
