They are infamous for their creation of **gholas**—cloned or resurrected individuals, such as Duncan Idaho and Hayt—using **axlotl tanks**, as well as their development of **Face Dancers**, shapeshifting infiltrators capable of replacing individuals to sow discord.  \n\nThe Tleilaxu are deeply involved in the power struggles of the Imperium, often clashing with factions like the **Bene Gesserit**, the **Spacing Guild**, and the **God Emperor Leto II**. They supply gholas to Leto’s forces while simultaneously scheming against him, including orchestrating attacks using Face Dancers. Their motives are shrouded in secrecy, blending religious fanaticism, political ambition, and a ruthless pursuit of genetic supremacy.  \n\nTheir technological prowess extends beyond cloning; they produce **artificial melange**, advanced poisons, and even cybernetic enhancements like artificial eyes. Despite their innovations, they are widely distrusted, viewed as amoral manipulators who embed hidden conditioning in their creations. Key figures like **Scytale** and **Waff** exemplify their cunning, engaging in complex alliances (such as with the Bene Gesserit) while plotting their own ascendance.  \n\nHistorically, the Tleilaxu broke the melange monopoly and preserved ancient knowledge, but their influence waned after the **Honored Matres** nearly eradicated them. By the time of the Scattering, they were a diminished yet persistent force, still leveraging their genetic expertise—including rumored creations like **Futars**—to survive.

Primarily, it is known for two distinct but critical applications. First, it serves as a technological principle underlying the operation of personal and defensive shields, which are vital to the military and political stability of the Imperium. These shields function by generating a protective barrier, but their potential nullification—whether through technological failure or external interference—could destabilize the balance of power across the galaxy.  \n\nSecond, the Holtzmann Effect has a more aggressive manifestation on the desert planet Arrakis, where it is employed as a weapon by the Cast Out. In this context, the effect is capable of summoning and enraging the native sandworms, colossal creatures central to the ecology and economy of Arrakis. This application demonstrates the dual nature of the Holtzmann Effect: as both a foundational technology for defense and a tool for warfare with devastating environmental consequences.  \n\nWhile these descriptions highlight different uses, they are not contradictory; rather, they illustrate the versatility of the Holtzmann Effect across technological and ecological domains. Its role in shield technology underscores its importance to imperial infrastructure, while its weaponization on Arrakis reveals its potential for destruction. Together, these aspects paint a comprehensive picture of the Holtzmann Effect as a pivotal force in the *Dune* universe, capable of both sustaining and disrupting societal order.\",2\n1420,YAKE,\"Yake is a character who interacts with Hwi and is later revealed to be a Face Dancer, a shapeshifter from the Tleilaxu, posing as the original Yake who is dead.\"\"\",2\n750,FREMEN WOMAN,,1\n826,CRYOLOGICAL TANK,A Tleilaxu technology used to preserve biological material for ghola creation>,1\n827,RELIGIOUS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT,A Tleilaxu division focused on manipulating belief systems for strategic purposes>,1\n830,GUILD STEERSMEN,\"Navigators of the Spacing Guild, mentioned as comparably dangerous to Tleilaxu>\",1\n1050,GHOLA TECHNOLOGY,,1\n1354,YAK,\"Yake is an Ixian who sent a message about the Tleilaxu's plan to attack the God Emperor.\"\"\",1\n1672,MASTER OF MASTERS,\"A Tleilaxu leader traveling to Rakis, targeted in Bene Gesserit plans>\",1\n1682,RAKIAN TEMPLE,\"The Rakian Temple is a site of conflict, attacked independently by Tleilaxu operatives.\"\"\",1\n1738,RAKIAN PRIESTS,\"The Rakian Priests are a religious group closely associated with the sandworms of their world.
