“就是自己对数学的感受。只要和数学有关，写什么都行。”他又补上一句：“这个内容也列入计分。”\n    学生们的脸上啪的一亮。\n    “这个也有分数吗？几分？”一个男学生问。\n    “那要看你们学的如何，如果不会解题，就好好加油写感想吧。”说着石神又重新坐回椅子。\n    所有的人都把考卷翻了过来，有人甚至已经开始动笔了，森冈也是其中之一。\n    这下子全体都能及格了，石神想。如果交白卷当然无法计分，不过只要有写东西就能看情况给分了。教务主任或许会有意见，不过应该会\n\n赞成他这个避免有人不及格的做法。\n    钟声响起，考试时间结束了。不过还有几个人喊着“再一下就好”，所以石神又多延长了五分钟。\n    收回考卷，走出教室。才刚关上门，就听到学生们开始大声鼓噪，也听到有人说“得救了”。\n    一回到办公室，男事务员正在等他。\n    “石神老师，有客人找你。”\n    “客人？找我？”\n    事务员走过来，贴在石神耳边说：“好像是刑警。”\n    “喔……”\n    “你看怎么办？”事务员露出窥探的表情。\n    “什么怎么办？对方不是正在等我吗？”\n    “是没错，不过我也可以帮你找个理由，请对方先回去。”\n    石神浮现苦笑。\n    “没那个必要，他在哪个房间？”\n    “我请他在会客室等你。”\n    “那，我马上过去。”他把考卷往自己包包里一塞，就抱着走出办公室，打算回家再批改。\n    事务员还想跟着，他说声“我一个人就行了”加以劝阻。他很清楚事务员在打什么主意，想必是想知道刑警的来意。而且他之所以主动表\n\n示可以帮他赶走刑警，恐怕也是以为这样就可从石神口中套出内幕。\n    一进会客室，他预期之中的对象正在独自等着，是草S刑警。\n    “不好意思，还跑到学校来打扰。”草S站起来，鞠躬致意。\n    “亏你知道我在学校，都已经放春假了。”\n    “其实我去过府上，看您好像不在家，所以打电话到学校。结果，就听说有什么补考，当老师也挺辛苦的。”\n    “没学生那么累，况且今天不是补考是二次补考。”\n    “我懂了，原来如此，您出的考题想必很难。”\n    “为什么？”石神直视着刑警的脸。\n    “没有，我只是多少有这种感觉而已。”\n    “一点也不难，我只是针对一般人自以为是的盲点出题。”\n    “盲点吗？”\n    “比如说看起来像是几何问题，其实是函数的问题。”石神在刑警对面坐下。“不过，这个应该不重要吧。对了，今天有何贵干？”\n    “是，也不是什么大事。”草S也坐下，取出记事本，“我想再详细请教一次那晚的事情。”\n    “你是指哪晚？”\n
