A prominent figure from the Scattering, he encounters the Bashar Miles Teg during their time in Ysai. Muzzafar acts as Teg’s host and guide, facilitating his introduction to an Honored Matre. During their interactions, Muzzafar displays a deep familiarity with Teg’s past, even showing him a holostat of Teg’s home, a frame bush, suggesting either prior intelligence gathering or a personal connection.  \n\nHowever, Muzzafar’s allegiance appears conflicted. While he warns Teg about the Honored Matre’s formidable power and expectations, he is also depicted as her loyal and submissive servant, possibly under her psychological or chemical influence. His behavior suggests a duality—he is both a respected military leader and a subordinate under the Honored Matre’s control. Some accounts describe him as sharing her cruel tendencies and joyless demeanor, implying a deeper complicity in her methods.  \n\nIn summary, Muzzafar is a complex figure: a skilled and high-ranking officer in Dur’s military, yet one whose loyalty and autonomy are compromised by his association with the Honored Matre.
