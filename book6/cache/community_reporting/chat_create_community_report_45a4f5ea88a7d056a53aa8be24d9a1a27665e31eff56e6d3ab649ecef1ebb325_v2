The fleet operates under the direction of key figures such as 丁仪 (Ding Yi) and other officers, indicating a structured command hierarchy that is essential for managing its complex operations.\n\nIn addition to its military endeavors, the fleet plays a significant role in international collaboration, coordinating efforts to establish contact with a probe. This highlights its function not only as a military entity but also as a facilitator of scientific exploration and communication in the broader context of space operations. The fleet is tasked with tracking and capturing spacecraft for observation and examination, underscoring its commitment to understanding and potentially harnessing advanced technologies.\n\nThe fleet has been actively monitoring the 螳螂号 (Mantis) spacecraft, having observed its explosion from a distance of one thousand kilometers. This incident reflects the high-stakes environment in which the fleet operates, where the ability to respond to unforeseen events is crucial.\n\nMoreover, the fleet is involved in peace negotiations with the United Nations, indicating its role in diplomatic efforts and the formation of a human delegation. This aspect of its operations suggests that the fleet is not solely focused on military might but also on fostering international relations and ensuring peace.\n\nThe fleet is composed of scientific officers dispatched from Europe and North America, tasked with conducting scientific investigations and capture operations. This diverse composition enhances its capabilities, allowing for a blend of military and scientific expertise in its missions.\n\nAdditionally, the fleet provides temporary housing for individuals like 史强 (Shi Qiang), indicating a structured system in place for retired personnel, which reflects its commitment to the welfare of its members even after their active service.\n\nIn summary, the \"\"舰队\"\" is a complex military organization that operates in space, focusing on capturing significant targets, conducting scientific research, and engaging in international diplomacy. Its leadership, diverse composition, and multifaceted roles underscore its importance in both military and scientific domains, as it navigates the challenges of space operations and global cooperation.\",22\r\n282,五月花号,“五月花”号是航天飞机，因天气原因不得不改降备用机场，执行太空任务。,5\r\n588,三大舰队,\"The \"\"三大舰队\"\" (Three Major Fleets) represent a significant military organization within Earth's space armed forces, holding substantial power and influence over human military operations in space. They are primarily tasked with coordinating interception efforts against the Trisolaran probe, a critical mission that underscores their strategic importance in the ongoing interactions with extraterrestrial entities.\n\nThe Three Major Fleets have developed a unique communication system, which is a blend of modern Chinese and English. This linguistic adaptation reflects their operational needs and the diverse backgrounds of their personnel, facilitating effective coordination and command during complex military operations.\n\nHistorically, the Three Major Fleets have played a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Earth's space endeavors, including their influence on the Starship Earth initiative. Their capabilities and strategic positioning make them a formidable force in the realm of military and aerospace power on the planet.\n\nIn summary, the 三大舰队 are a powerful military organization responsible for intercepting the Trisolaran probe, equipped with a specialized language for effective communication, and have a significant historical impact on Earth's space military operations.\",8\r\n737,亚当号,亚当号是一艘战舰，隶属于联合舰队，参与了多场太空战斗。作为联合舰队中的最后一艘战舰，亚当号在其服役期间展现了卓越的战斗能力和战略价值。然而，最终它的命运悲惨，亚当号被核火球吞噬，结束了其辉煌的战斗历程。,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1453,罗辑,旧城区,罗辑和史强从旧城区出发，驶向西方,269\r\n646,章北海,核聚变基地,\"章北海 is involved in discussions at the 核聚变基地, which is critical for the development of advanced spacecraft\",79\r\n1166,中校,水滴,中校参与了对水滴的接触和观察，表现出对其特性的惊奇,64\r\n1144,水滴,捕获行动,水滴是捕获行动的目标，螳螂号的任务是接触水滴。,63\r\n1181,无限边疆号,水滴,\"The entity known as \"\"水滴\"\" (Water Drop) engaged in a catastrophic collision with \"\"无限边疆号\"\" (Infinite Frontier). This incident occurred at an extremely high velocity, resulting in significant damage to the Infinite Frontier's hull. The impact created a circular hole in the ship's structure, which subsequently triggered a massive explosion.\n\nIn addition to the initial collision, the Water Drop penetrated the hull of the Infinite Frontier, leading to a nuclear fusion reaction. This reaction caused the ship's material to melt, exacerbating the destruction already inflicted by the impact. The combination of the high-speed collision and the ensuing nuclear event resulted in a catastrophic failure of the Infinite Frontier, marking a devastating moment in its operational history. \n\nOverall, the encounter between the Water Drop and the Infinite Frontier was marked by extreme violence and destruction, culminating in the ship's severe structural compromise and the release of immense energy due to the fusion reaction.\",63\r\n1187,远方号,水滴,水滴穿透了远方号并引发核火球。,62\r\n1188,雾角号,水滴,水滴穿透了雾角号并引发核火球。,62\r\n1189,南极洲号,水滴,水滴穿透了南极洲号并引发核火球。,62\r\n1242,夏号,水滴,夏号在水滴的攻击中未能逃脱，最终被摧毁。,62\r\n1190,极限号,水滴,水滴穿透了极限号并引发核火球。,60\r\n1200,哥伦比亚号,水滴,水滴击穿了哥伦比亚号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1201,正义号,水滴,水滴击穿了正义号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1202,马萨达号,水滴,水滴击穿了马萨达号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1203,质子号,水滴,水滴击穿了质子号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1204,炎帝号,水滴,水滴击穿了炎帝号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1205,大西洋号,水滴,水滴击穿了大西洋号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1206,天狼号,水滴,水滴击穿了天狼号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1207,感恩节号,水滴,水滴击穿了感恩节号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1208,前进号,水滴,水滴击穿了前进号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1209,汉号,水滴,水滴击穿了汉号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1210,暴风雨号,水滴,水滴击穿了暴风雨号并导致其摧毁,60\r\n1211,第二队列,水滴,水滴在战斗中摧毁了第二队列,60\r\n1212,第三队列,水滴,水滴在战斗中攻击了第三队列中的战舰,60\r\n1213,第一队列,水滴,水滴在战斗中与第一队列的战舰发生冲突,60\r\n1214,牛顿号,水滴,水滴穿透了牛顿号战舰,60\r\n1215,启蒙号,水滴,水滴穿透了启蒙号战舰,60\r\n1216,白垩纪号,水滴,水滴穿透了白垩纪号战舰,60\r\n1232,水滴,纳尔逊号,纳尔逊号在太空战争中遭受水滴的攻击，并尝试进行拦截。,60\r\n1233,水滴,绿号,绿号使用电磁动能武器向水滴射击以进行防御。,60\r\n1252,水滴,大毁灭,大毁灭是水滴对人类太空武装力量的攻击事件,60\r\n1471,三万四千公里,水滴,水滴 is noted to have crossed the distance of 三万四千公里 in its path,60\r\n1475,北半球,水滴,水滴的减速现象在北半球被观察到，提醒人们注意这一天文事件。,60\r\n1479,水滴,监测系统,监测系统用于观察水滴的状态，提供实时数据,60\r\n1480,水滴,全球通讯系统,水滴事件影响全球通讯系统的功能，导致信息传递受到干扰,60\r\n373,丁仪,泰勒,\"丁仪 and 泰勒 are engaged in a discussion about space and nuclear technology, with 泰勒 proposing a plan that 丁仪 is skeptical about.\",49\r\n1059,雾伞计划,雷迪亚兹,Rediaz's strategic plans contributed to the development of the Umbrella Project,44\r\n1118,量子号,联合舰队,\"量子号 is a significant vessel within the 联合舰队, playing a crucial role in military operations conducted in space.
