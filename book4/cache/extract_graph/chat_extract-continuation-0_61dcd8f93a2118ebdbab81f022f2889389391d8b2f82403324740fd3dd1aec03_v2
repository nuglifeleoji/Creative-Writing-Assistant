�阵地而感到很痛心。金光明的老婆姚淑芳，一天穿戴得象个资产阶级小姐，怎么能教育好贫下中农的后代？只是她属于公派教师，他把这女人没办法。他前几年曾跑到公社找教育专干，让他把姚淑芳调到外村去。但专干不同意，说姚淑芳家在双水村，生活和各方面都比较方便，又是一个教龄不短的老师，没理由把人家调开。他也就再没办法了。另一个教师金成，仗着他爸是大队副书记，本人又在学校负责，也常不把他孙玉亭放在眼里。他知道，姚淑芳和金成虽然表面上尊重他这个贫管会主任，但心里都瞧不起他。哼！我孙玉亭除过缺吃少穿外，什么地方不如你们？共产党员！贫农成份！怎？ \n　　孙玉亭一路走，一路庄严地想：双水村资产阶级把持教育阵地的历史就要结束了。再说，润生和少平不仅是贫下中农子弟，还是自家人，他这个贫管会主任就再不会象晁盖一样被架空了！ \n　　玉亭走得紧急，又用脑子，虽然天气冷，但额头上却渗出了汗水。 \n　　他上了他哥家的小土坡，脸上不由自主地露出笑容。知道他哥一家人听到这消息，一定会很感激他，而且也会另眼看待他了。哥！别以为玉亭光知道连累你们，吃你们一碗饭，抽你们几袋烟。我在大事上给你们帮大忙哩！哥，你说你早年间供我念书，后来又给我娶了媳妇；可我也帮你娶了个不要财礼的儿媳妇嘛！现在我又把少平拉扯到学校去教书，这该把欠你的情补上了吧？ \n　　孙玉亭进了他哥家的门，看见除过他的老母亲和大嫂外，其余五个人都出山劳动还没有回家来。他大嫂正在锅灶上忙着做饭。老母亲坐在一堆被褥里，手里拿些白药片，用手指头拨拉着一颗一颗细心地数着。 \n　　他不想先把这事给大嫂说——等其他人回来再说。 \n　　他于是就费劲地把那双烂鞋脱在脚地上，上了他哥家的土炕，坐在他妈身边。 \n　　老母亲心疼地用瘦手摸了摸小儿子的破棉袄，说：“这么单薄，你冷呀！叫你媳妇再给你絮上一点棉花……” \n　　玉亭对他妈说：“家里连一点旧棉絮都没了。”“那你把我那个旧棉袄拿回去，拆了给你絮上……”老母亲难过地揩了揩自己的红眼。 \n　　这时候，在锅上忙着的少安妈说：“我们还剩点旧棉花，罢了你拿去。”
