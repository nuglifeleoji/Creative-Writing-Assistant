�。只是为难地对两位父老说，这要征得他媳妇的同意。海民的家事由银花掌管，他只能把这一点不害臊地向两位老人当面表明。两位老人也知道这是事实，只好等待海民去请示他媳妇。 \n　　当天晚上，海民就到父亲家来了。他告诉等待消息的父亲和四爸：银花不同意他们来干活！ \n　　田四田五一时瞪住眼睛，不知该说什么。 \n　　田五发了半天呆，长叹一口气说：“我和你四爸等于去给你们揽工，你们都不要。你们比旧社会的地主都残酷！我和你妈吞糠咽菜把你拉扯大，如今我们不行了，你连我们的一点死活也看不见！你还算个人吗？” \n　　田五数落儿子的时候，田四一直低垂着苍头——海民是弟弟的儿子，他无权数落人家。前一队饲养员此刻只能承认现实的打击是一件自然的事。 \n　　田海民无言地接受了父亲的一顿责骂，然后又无言地退出了这个把他养育大的破窑洞。他在黑暗的村道上回家的时候，眼里噙满了泪水。 \n　　唉，海民不是不知道两家老人的苦情。但他无法说服自己的女人。没办法呀！他要和这女人一块生活，一块过光景日月；如果和银花闹翻，除不能解决老人们的问题，他自己的光景也要烂包！他无法在老人面前为自己的难肠辩解。他盘算只能在自己赚下钱后，背着银花偷偷给他们帮扶一点，此外便束手无策了。一个男人活到这种地步，那痛苦也是外人所不能理解的。 \n　　第二天，受到生活和感情双重打击的田五，在公众面前仍然扮演了他那惯常的乐天派的角色。在神仙山那里，他仍然神仙般快活地唱他的信天游。至于唱完后哭没哭，我们就不知晓了…… \n　　过了没多久，又起了意外的风波。海民家的隔墙邻居刘玉升，突然传出了一个可怕的预言。这位先知先觉的神汉危言耸听地散布说，在田海民的养鱼池里，将要诞生一条“鱼精”。说这鱼精必定要在双水村殃害人和牲灵；而且以后还要在外地去作怪哩！一些迷信的村民立刻开始诅咒海民和银花，有的人并且扬言要给鱼池里撒毒药！ \n　　本来情绪十分高昂的海民夫妇，被这谣言气得连饭也吃不下去。他们惹不起这位自称掌握全村人生死命运的神汉。但他们也决不放弃养鱼——他们已经花费七百元资金了！ \n　　与此同时，田五因生儿子的气，竟然用荒诞的手法编了一段“链子嘴”使刘玉升的谣言变为戏谑性的艺术在村子里传播开来—— \n　　双水村，有能人，能不过银花和海民。 \n　　东拉河边挖土坑，要在里面养鱼�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>田海民<|>PERSON<|>田海民 is a character who struggles with family obligations and the
