�马列成阵势，勒马门旗下看时，见吕布出阵：头戴三叉束发紫金冠，体挂西川红锦百花袍，身披兽面吞头连环铠，腰系勒甲玲珑狮蛮带；弓箭随身，手持画戟，坐下嘶风赤兔马：果然是“人中吕布，马中赤兔”！王匡回头问曰：“谁敢出战？”后面一将，纵马挺枪而出。匡视之，乃河内名将方悦。两马相交，无五合，被吕布一戟刺于马下，挺戟直冲过来。匡军大败，四散奔走。布东西冲杀，如入无人之境。幸得乔瑁、袁遗两军皆至，来救王匡，吕布方退。三路诸侯，各折了些人马，退三十里下寨。随后五路军马都至，一处商议，言吕布英雄，无人可敌。\n\n    正虑间，小校报来：“吕布搦战。”八路诸侯，一齐上马。军分八队，布在高冈。遥望吕布一簇军马，绣旗招飐，先来冲阵。上党太守张杨部将穆顺，出马挺枪迎战，被吕布手起一戟，刺于马下。众大惊。北海太守孔融部将武安国，使铁锤飞马而出。吕布挥戟拍马来迎。战到十余合，一戟砍断安国手腕，弃锤于地而走。八路军兵齐出，救了武安国。吕布退回去了。众诸侯回寨商议。曹操曰：“吕布英勇无敌，可会十八路诸侯，共议良策。若擒了吕布，董卓易诛耳。”\n\n    正议间，吕布复引兵搦战。八路诸侯齐出。公孙瓒挥槊亲战吕布。战不数合，瓒败走。吕布纵赤兔马赶来。那马日行千里，飞走如风。看看赶上，布举画戟望瓒后心便刺。傍边一将，圆睁环眼，倒竖虎须，挺丈八蛇矛，飞马大叫：“三姓家奴休走！燕人张飞在此！”吕布见了，弃了公孙瓒，便战张飞。飞抖擞精神，酣战吕布。连斗五十余合，不分胜负。云长见了，把马一拍，舞八十二斤青龙偃月刀，来夹攻吕布。三匹马丁字儿厮杀。战到三十合，战不倒吕布。刘玄德掣双股剑，骤黄鬃马，刺斜里也来助战。这三个围住吕布。转灯儿般厮杀。八路人马，都看得呆了。吕布架隔遮拦不定，看着玄德面上，虚刺一戟，玄德急闪。吕布荡开阵角，倒拖画戟，飞马便回。三个那里肯舍，拍马赶来。八路军兵，喊声大震，一齐掩杀。吕布军马望关上奔走；玄德、关、张随后赶来。古人曾有\n######################\nOutput:",
