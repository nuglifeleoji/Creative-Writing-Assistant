She is described as a foster mother with limited assets, though she resides in a refined traditional Japanese house with a \"\"茶道里千家\"\" (Urasenke tea ceremony school) nameplate, indicating her involvement in cultural arts.  \n\n唐泽礼子 took in 雪穗 after the latter's biological parents died in an accident, providing her with a stable upbringing. She prioritized 雪穗's education, enrolling her in a private school and hiring tutors, later reflecting that this decision was correct. Additionally, 礼子 taught 雪穗 traditional arts such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement, further refining her social graces.  \n\nDespite her composed demeanor—often listening more than speaking during family gatherings—礼子 was deeply caring toward 雪穗. After her death, 雪穗 exhibited profound grief, underscoring their close bond. There are conflicting details about whether 礼子 was 雪穗's adoptive mother or a potential candidate, but the prevailing narrative confirms her as the legal guardian.  \n\nAn incidental detail notes that 礼子 once owned a cactus盆栽 (potted cactus), which may have inadvertently contained fragments of 松浦勇's sunglasses mixed in the soil. She was also invited to 雪穗's home during New Year's celebrations, further illustrating their familial connection.  \n\nIn her final years, 礼子 fell into a coma before passing away. Her death marked a significant emotional loss for 雪穗, who had been shaped by 礼子's guidance and sophistication.  \n\nIn summary, 唐泽礼子 was a dignified, nurturing figure who elevated 雪穗's social and cultural standing, leaving a lasting impact on her adoptive daughter's life.
