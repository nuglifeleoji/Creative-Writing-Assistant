兵，分命大将据守险要，养精蓄锐。不过数年，中国日盛，吴、蜀二国必自相残害：那时图之，岂非胜算？乞陛下裁之。”睿乃问司马懿曰：“此论若何？懿奏曰：“孙尚书所言极当。”睿从之，命懿分拨诸将守把险要，留郭淮、张郃守长安。大赏三军，驾回洛阳。却说孔明回到汉中，计点军士，只少赵云、邓芝，心中甚忧；乃令关兴、张苞，各引一军接应。二人正欲起身，忽报赵云、邓芝到来，并不曾折一人一骑；辎重等器，亦无遗失。孔明大喜，亲引诸将出迎。赵云慌忙下马伏地曰：“败军之将，何劳丞相远接？”孔明急扶起，执手而言曰：“是吾不识贤愚，以致如此！各处兵将败损，惟子龙不折一人一骑，何也？”邓芝告曰：“某引兵先行，子龙独自断后，斩将立功，敌人惊怕，因此军资什物，不曾遗弃。”孔明曰：“真将军也！”遂取金五十斤以赠赵云，又取绢一万匹赏云部卒。云辞曰：“三军无尺寸之功，某等俱各有罪；若反受赏，乃丞相赏罚不明也。且请寄库，候今冬赐与诸军未迟。”孔明叹曰：“先帝在日，常称子龙之德，今果如此！”乃倍加钦敬。\n\n    忽报马谡、王平、魏延、高翔至。孔明先唤王平入帐，责之曰：“吾令汝同马谡守街亭，汝何不谏之，致使失事？”平曰：“某再三相劝，要在当道筑土城，安营守把。参军大怒不从，某因此自引五千军离山十里下寨。魏兵骤至，把山四面围合，某引兵冲杀十余次，皆不能入。次日土崩瓦解，降者无数。某孤军难立，故投魏文长求救。半途又被魏兵困在山谷之中，某奋死杀出。比及归寨，早被魏兵占了。及投列柳城时，路逢高翔，遂分兵三路去劫魏寨，指望克复街亭。因见街亭并无伏路军，以此心疑。登高望之，只见魏延、高翔被魏兵围住，某即杀入重围，救出二将，就同参军并在一处。某恐失却阳平关，因此急来回守。非某之不谏也。丞相不信，可问各部将校。”孔明喝退，又唤马谡入帐。\n\n
