He thought instead of the Corrino he had been ordered to kill. Affliction. The Corrino, descendant of a Family which once had ruled this Empire, had been revealed as a softly fat middle-aged man who hungered after power and conspired for spice. Idaho had ordered a Fish Speaker to kill him, an act which had aroused Moneo to a fit of intense questioning.\n“Why didn’t you kill him yourself?”\n“| wanted to see how the Fish Speakers performed.”\n“And your judgment of their performance?”\n“Efficient.”\nBut the death of the Corrino had inflicted Idaho with a sense of unreality. A fat little man lying in a pool of his own blood, an undistinguished shadow among the night shadows\nof a plastone street. It was unreal. Idaho could remember Muad’Dib saying: “The mind imposes this framework which it calls ‘reality.’ That arbitrary framework has a tendency to be quite independent of what your senses report.” What reality moved the Lord Leto?\nIdaho looked at Siona standing against the orchard background and the green hills of Goygoa. “Let’s go down to the village and find our quarters. I’d like to be alone.”\n“The Fish Speakers will put us in the same quarters.”\n“With them?”\n“No, just the two of us together. The reason’s simple enough. The Worm wants me to breed with the great Duncan Idaho.”\n“I pick my own partners,” Idaho growled.\n“I’m sure one of our Fish Speakers would be delighted,” Siona said. She whirled away from him and set off down the hill.\nIdaho watched her for a moment, the lithe young body swaying like the limbs of the orchard trees in the wind.\n“I’m not his stud,” Idaho muttered. “That’s one thing he'll have to understand.”\nAs each day passes, you become increasingly unreal, more alien and remote from what | find myself to be on that new day. | am the only reality and, as you differ from me, you lose reality. The more curious | become, the less curious are those who worship me. Religion suppresses curiosity. What | do subtracts from the worshipper. Thus it is that eventually | will do nothing, giving it all back to frightened people who will find themselves on that day alone and forced to act for themselves.\n—THE STOLEN JOURNALS\nt was a sound like no other, the sound of a waiting mob,\nand it came down the long tunnel to where Idaho marched ahead of the Royal Cart—nervous whispers magnified into an ultimate whisper, the shuffling of one gigantic foot, the stirring of an enormous garment. And the smell—sweet perspiration mixed with the milky breath of sexual excitement.\nInmeir and the others of his Fish Speaker escort had brought Idaho here in the first hour after dawn, coming down to the plaza of Onn while it lay in cold green shadows. They had lifted off immediately after turning him over to other Fish Speakers, Inmeir obviously unhappy because she was required to take Siona to the Citadel and thus would miss the ritual of Siaynoq.\nThe new escort, vibrant with repressed emotion, had taken him into a region deep beneath the plaza, a place not on any of the city charts Idaho had studied. It was a maze— first one direction and then another through corridors wide enough and high enough to accommodate the Royal Cart. Idaho lost track of directions and fell to reflecting on the preceding night.\nThe sleeping quarters in Goygoa, although Spartan and small, had been comfortable—two cots to a room, each\nroom a box with white-washed walls, a single window and a single door. The rooms were strung along a corridor ina building designated as Goygoa’s “Guest House.”\nAnd Siona had been right. Without asking if it suited him, Idaho had been quartered with her, Inmeir acting as though this were an accepted thing.\nWhen the door closed on them, Siona said: “If you touch me, | will try to kill you.”\nIt was uttered with such dry sincerity that Idaho almost laughed. “I would prefer privacy,” he said. “Consider yourself alone.”\nHe had slept with a light wariness, remembering dangerous nights in the Atreides service, the readiness for combat. The room was seldom truly dark—moonlight coming through the curtained window, even starlight reflecting from the chalk-white walls. He had found himself nervously sensitive to Siona, to the smell of her, the stirrings, her breathing. Several times he had come fully awake to listen, aware on two of those occasions that she, too, was listening.\nMorning and the flight to Onn had come as a relief. They had broken their fast with a drink of cold fruit juice, Idaho glad to enter the predawn darkness for a brisk walk to the ‘thopter. He did not speak directly to Siona and he found himself resenting the curious glances of the Fish Speakers.\nSiona spoke to him only once, leaning out of the ‘thopter as he left it in the plaza.\n“It would not offend me to be your friend,” she said.\nSuch a curious way of putting it. He had felt vaguely embarrassed. “Yes... well, certainly.”\nThe new escort had led him away then, coming at last to a terminal in the maze. Leto awaited him there on the Royal Cart. The meeting place was a wide spot in a corridor which stretched off into the converging distance on Idaho’s right. The walls were dark brown streaked with golden lines which glittered in the yellow light of glowglobes. The escort took\nup positions behind the cart, moving smartly and leaving Idaho to stand confronting Leto’s cowled face.\n“Duncan, you will precede me when we go to Siaynog,” Leto said.\nIdaho stared into the dark blue wells of the God Emperor’s eyes, angered by the mystery and secrecy, the obvious air of private excitement in this place. He felt that everything he had been told about Siaynog only deepened the mystery.\n“Am | truly the Commander of your Guard, m’Lord?” Idaho asked, resentment heavy in his voice.\n“Indeed! And | bestow a signal honor upon you now. Few adult males ever share Siaynoq.”\n“What happened in the city last night?”\n“Bloody violence in some places. It is quite calm this morning, however.”\n“Casualties?”\n“Not worth mentioning.”\nIdaho nodded. Leto’s prescient powers had warned of some peril to his Duncan. Thus, the flight into the rural safety of Goygoa.\n“You have been to Goygoa,” Leto said. “Were you tempted to stay?”\n“No!”\n“Do not be angry with me,” Leto said. “I did not send you to Goygoa.”\nIdaho sighed. “What was the danger which required that you send me away?”\n“It was not to you,” Leto said. “But you excite my guards to excessive displays of their abilities. Last night’s activities did not require this.”\n“Oh?” This thought shocked Idaho. He had never thought of himself as one to inspire particular heroism unless he personally demanded it. One whipped up the troops. Leaders such as the original Leto, this one’s grandfather, had inspired by their presence.\n“You are extremely precious to me, Duncan,” Leto said.\n“Yes... well, I’m still not your stud!”\n“Your wishes will be honored, of course. We will discuss it another time.”\nIdaho glanced at the Fish Speaker escort, all of them wide-eyed and attentive.\n“Is there always violence when you come to Onn?” Idaho asked.\n“It goes in cycles. The malcontents are quite subdued now. It will be more peaceful for a time.”\nIdaho looked back at Leto’s inscrutable face. “What happened to my predecessor?”\n“Haven't my Fish Speakers told you?”\n“They say he died in defense of his God.”\n“And you have heard a contrary rumor.”\n“What happened?”\n“He died because he was too close to me. | did not remove him to a Safe place in time.”\n“A place like Goygoa.”\n“I would have preferred him to live out his days there in peace, but you well know, Duncan, that you are not a seeker after peace.”\nIdaho swallowed, encountering an odd lump in his throat. “I would still like the particulars of his death. He has a family...”\n“You will get the particulars and do not fear for his family. They are my wards. | will keep them safely at a distance. You know how violence seeks me out. That is one of my functions. It is unfortunate that those | admire and love must suffer because of this.”\nIdaho pursed his lips, not satisfied with what he heard.\n“Set your mind at ease, Duncan,” Leto said. “Your predecessor died because he was too close to me.”\nThe Fish Speaker escort stirred restively. Idaho glanced at them, then looked to the right up the tunnel.\n“Yes, it is time,” Leto said. “We must not keep the women\nwaiting. March close ahead of me, Duncan, and | will answer\nyour questions about Siaynoq.”\nObedient because he could think of no suitable alternative, Idaho turned on his heel and led off the procession. He heard the cart creak into motion behind him, the faint footsteps of the escort following.\nThe cart fell silent with an abruptness which jerked Idaho’s attention around. The reason was immediately apparent.\n“You're on the suspensors,” he said, returning his attention to the front.\n“I have retracted the wheels because the women will press close around me,” Leto said. “We can’t crush their feet.”\n“What is Siaynoq? What is it really?” Idaho asked.\n“I have told you. It is the Great Sharing.”\n“Do | smell spice?”\n“Your nostrils are sensitive. There is a small amount of melange in the wafers.”\nIdaho shook his head.\nTrying to understand this event, Idaho had asked Leto directly at the first opportunity after their arrival in Onn, “What is the Feast of Siaynoq?”\n“We share a wafer, no more. Even | partake.”\n“Is it like the Orange Catholic ritual?”\n“Oh, no! It is not my flesh. It is the sharing. They are reminded that they are only female, as you are only male, but | am all. They share with the all.”\nIdaho had not liked the tone of this. “Only male?”\n“Do you know who they lampoon at the Feast, Duncan?”\n“Who?”\n“Men who have offended them. Listen to them when they talk softly among themselves.”\nIdaho had taken this as a warning: Don’t offend the Fish Speakers. You incur their wrath at your mortal peril!\nNow, as he marched ahead of Leto in the tunnel, Idaho felt that he had heard the words correctly but learned nothing from them. He spoke over his shoulder.\n“| don’t understand the Sharing.”\n“We are together in the ritual. You will see it. You will feel it. My Fish Speakers are the repository of a special knowledge, an unbroken line which only they share. Now, you will partake of it and they will love you for it. Listen to them carefully. They are open to ideas of affinity. Their terms of endearment for each other have no reservations.”\nMore words, |daho thought. More mystery.\nHe could discern a gradual widening in the tunnel; the ceiling sloped higher. There were more glowglobes, tuned now into the deep orange. He could see the high arch of an opening about three hundred meters away, rich red light there in which he could make out glistening faces which swayed gently left\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IDAHO<|>PERSON<|>Duncan Idaho is a skilled warrior and commander, known for his service to the Atreides and his complex relationship with the God Emperor Leto II.
