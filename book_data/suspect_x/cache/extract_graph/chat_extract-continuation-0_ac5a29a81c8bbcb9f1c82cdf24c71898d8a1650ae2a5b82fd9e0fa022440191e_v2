Return to Sietch Tabr, Stilgar. Gurney Halleck will join you there as my advisor in your Council.”\n“Don’t you trust me, My Lord?” Stilgar’s voice was low.\n“Completely, else I’d not send Gurney to you. He’ll begin recruiting the new force we'll need soon. | accept your pledge of fealty, Stilgar. You are dismissed.”\nStilgar bowed low, backed off the steps, turned and left the hall. The other Naibs fell into step behind him according to the Fremen principle that “the last shall be first.” But some of their queries could be heard on the throne as they departed.\n“What were you talking about up there, Stil? What does that mean, those words on Muad’Dib’s water?”\nLeto spoke to Farad’n. “Did you get all of that, Scribe?”\n“Yes, My Lord.”\n“My grandmother tells me she trained you well in the mnemonic processes of the Bene Gesserit. That’s good. | don’t want you scribbling beside me.”\n“AS you command, My Lord.”\n“Come and stand before me,” Leto said.\nFarad’n obeyed, more than ever thankful for Jessica’s training. When you accepted the fact that Leto no longer was human, no longer could think as humans thought, the course of his Golden Path became ever more frightening.\nLeto looked up at Farad’n. The guards stood well back out of earshot. Only the counselors of the Inner Presence remained on the floor of the Great Hall, and they stood in subservient groups well beyond the first step. Ghanima had moved closer to rest an arm on the back of the throne.\n“You've not yet agreed to give me your Sardaukar,” Leto said. “But you will.”\n“I owe you much, but not that,” Farad’n said.\n“You think they’d not mate well with my Fremen?”\n“As well as those new friends, Stilgar and Tyekanik.”\n“Yet you refuse?”\n“Į await your offer.”\n“Then | must make the offer, Knowing you will never repeat it. | pray my grandmother has done her part well, that you are prepared to understand.”\n“What must | understand?”\n“There’s always a prevailing mystique in any civilization, Leto said. “It builds itself as a barrier against change, and that always leaves future generations unprepared for the universe’s treachery. All mystiques are the same in building these barriers—the religious mystique, the hero-leader mystique, the messiah mystique, the mystique of science/technology, and the mystique of nature itself. We live in an Imperium which such a mystique has shaped, and now that Imperium is falling apart because most people don’t distinguish between mystique and their universe. You see, the mystique is like demon possession; it tends to take over the consciousness, becoming all things to the observer.”\n“| recognize your grandmother’s wisdom in these words,” Farad’n said.\n“Well and good, cousin. She asked me if | were Abomination. | answered in the negative. That was my first treachery. You see, Ghanima escaped this, but | did not. | was forced to balance the inner lives under the pressure of excessive melange. | had to seek the active cooperation of those aroused lives within me. Doing this, | avoided the most malignant and chose a dominant helper thrust upon me by the inner awareness which was my father. | am not, in truth, my father or this helper. Then again, | am not the Second Leto.”\n”\n“Explain.”\n“You have an admirable directness,” Leto said. “I’m a community dominated by one who was ancient and Surpassingly powerful. He fathered a dynasty which endured for three thousand of our years. His name was Harum and, until his line trailed out in the congenital weaknesses and superstitions of a descendant, his subjects lived in a rhythmic sublimity. They moved unconsciously with the changes of the seasons. They bred individuals who tended to be short-lived, superstitious, and easily led by a god-king. Taken as a whole, they were a powerful people. Their Survival aS a species became habit.”\n“I don’t like the sound of that,” Farad’n said.\n“Nor do l, really,” Leto said. “But it’s the universe I'll create.”\n“Why?”\n“It’s a lesson | learned on Dune. We kept the presence of death a dominant specter among the living here. By that presence, the dead changed the living. The people of such a society sink down into their bellies. But when the time comes for the opposite, when they arise, they are great and beautiful.”\n“That doesn’t answer my question,” Farad’n protested.\n“You don’t trust me, cousin.”\n“Nor does your own grandmother.”\n“And with good reason,” Leto said. “But she acquiesces because she must. Bene Gesserits are pragmatists in the end. | share their view of our universe, you know. You wear the marks of that universe. You retain the habits of rule, cataloguing all around you in terms of their possible threat or value.”\n“I agreed to be your scribe.”\n“It amused you and flattered your real talent, which is that of historian. You’ve a definite genius for reading the present in terms of the past. You’ve anticipated me on several occasions.”\n“I don’t like your veiled insinuations,” Farad’n said.\n“Good. You come from infinite ambition to your present lowered estate. Didn’t my grandmother warn you about infinity? It attracts us like a floodlight in the night, blinding us to the excesses it can inflict upon the finite.”\n“Bene Gesserit aphorisms!” Farad’n protested.\n“But much more precise,” Leto said. “The Bene Gesserit believed they could predict the course of evolution. But they overlooked their own changes in the course of that evolution. They assumed they would stand still while their breeding plan evolved. | have no such reflexive blindness. Look carefully at me, Farad’n, for | am no longer human.”\n“So your sister assures me.” Farad’n hesitated. Then: “Abomination?”\n“By the Sisterhood’s definition, perhaps. Harum is cruel and autocratic. | partake of his cruelty. Mark me well: | have the cruelty of the husbandman, and this human universe is my farm. Fremen once kept tame eagles as pets, but I'll keep a tame Farad’n.”\nFarad’n’s face darkened. “Beware my claws, cousin. | well know my Sardaukar would fall in time before your Fremen. But we’d wound you sorely, and there are jackals waiting to pick off the weak.”\n“I will use you well, that | promise,” Leto said. He leaned forward. “Did | not say I’m no longer human? Believe me, cousin. No children will spring from my loins, for | no longer have loins. And this forces my second treachery.”\nFarad’n waited in silence, seeing at last the direction of Leto’s argument.\n“I shall go against every Fremen precept,” Leto said. “They will accept because they can do nothing else. | kept you here under the lure of a betrothal, but there will be no betrothal of you and Ghanima. My sister will marry me!”\n“But you—”\n“Marry, | said. Ghanima must continue the Atreides line. There’s also the matter of the Bene Gesserit breeding\nprogram, which is now my breeding program.”\n“| refuse,” Farad’n said.\n“You refuse to father an Atreides dynasty?”\n“What dynasty? You’ll occupy the throne for thousands of years.”\n“And mold your descendants in my image. It will be the most intensive, the most inclusive training program in all of history. We'll be an ecosystem in miniature. You see, whatever system animals choose to survive by must be based on the pattern of interlocking communities, interdependence, working together in the common design which is the system. And this system will produce the most knowledgeable rulers ever seen.”\n“You put fancy words on a most distasteful—”\n“Who will survive Kralizec?” Leto asked. “I promise you, Kralizec will come.”\n“You're a madman! You will shatter the Empire.”\n“Of course | will... and I’m not a man. But l'Il create a new consciousness in all men. | tell you that below the desert of Dune there’s a secret place with the greatest treasure of all time. | do not lie. When the last worm dies and the last melange is harvested upon our sands, these deep treasures will spring up throughout our universe. As the power of the spice monopoly fades and the hidden stockpiles make their mark, new powers will appear throughout our realm. It is time humans learned once more to live in their instincts.”\nGhanima took her arm from the back of the throne, crossed to Farad’n’s side, took his hand.\n“As my mother was not wife, you will not be husband,” Leto said. “But perhaps there will be love, and that will be enough.”\n“Each day, each moment brings its change,” Ghanima said. “One learns by recognizing the moments.”\nFarad’n felt the warmth of Ghanima’s tiny hand as an insistent presence. He recognized the ebb and flow of Leto’s\narguments, but not once had Voice been used. It was an appeal to the guts, not to the mind.\n“Is this what you offer for my Sardaukar?” he asked.\n“Much, much more, cousin. | offer your descendants the Imperium. | offer you peace.”\n“What will be the outcome of your peace?”\n“Its opposite,” Leto said, his voice calmly mocking.\nFarad’n shook his head. “I find the price for my Sardaukar very high. Must | remain Scribe, the secret father of your royal line?”\n“You must.”\n“Will you try to force me into your habit of peace?”\n“T will.”\n“lIl resist you every day of my life.”\n“But that’s the function | expect of you, cousin. It’s why | chose you. l'Il make it official. | will give you a new name. From this moment, you'll be called Breaking of the Habit, which in our tongue is Harg al-Ada. Come, cousin, don’t be obtuse. My mother taught you well. Give me your Sardaukar.”\n“Give them,” Ghanima echoed. “He’ll have them one way or another.”\nFarad’n heard fear for himself in her voice. Love, then? Leto asked not for reason, but for an intuitive leap. “Take them,” Farad’n said.\n“Indeed,” Leto said. He lifted himself from the throne, a curiously fluid motion as though he kept his terrible powers under most delicate control. Leto stepped down then to Ghanima’s level, moved her gently until she faced away from him, turned and placed his back against hers. “Note this, cousin Harq al-Ada. This is the way it will always be with us. We’ll stand thus when we are married. Back to back, each looking outward from the other to protect the one thing which we have always been.” He turned, looked mockingly at Farad’n, lowered his voice: “Remember that, cousin, when you're face to face with my Ghanima.\nRemember that when you whisper of love and soft things, when you are most tempted by the habits of my peace and my contentment. Your back will remain exposed.”\nTurning from them, he strode down the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen settlement where Stilgar is instructed to return to.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Naib of the Fremen and a key figure in the Atreides hierarchy.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>PERSON<|>Gurney Halleck is an advisor to Leto II and will join Stilgar's Council.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO II<|>PERSON<|>Leto II is the God Emperor, a transformed being with ancient memories and powers, ruling the Imperium.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FARAD'N<|>PERSON<|>Farad'n is a scribe and historian, trained by the Bene Gesserit, and later named Harq al-Ada by Leto II.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is Leto II's sister, an Atreides heir, and part of the breeding program.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bene Gesserit is a powerful sisterhood with advanced mental and physical training, involved in breeding programs.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Fremen are the native people of Dune, fierce warriors, and loyal to the Atreides.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SARDauKAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sardaukar are elite soldiers of the Imperium, originally loyal to the Corrino family.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPERIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Imperium is the galactic empire ruled by Leto II.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNE<|>GEO<|>Dune is the desert planet, central to the Imperium's power due to its spice melange.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KRALIZEC<|>EVENT<|>Kralizec is the prophesied end-times battle mentioned by Leto II.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Path is Leto II's vision for the future survival of humanity.\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STILGAR<|>SIETCH TABR<|>Stilgar is instructed to return to Sietch Tabr<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>STILGAR<|>Leto II commands Stilgar and accepts his pledge of fealty<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>GURNEY HALLECK<|>Gurney Halleck serves as Leto II's advisor<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>FARAD'N<|>Leto II names Farad'n as Harq al-Ada and demands his Sardaukar<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>GHANIMA<|>Leto II plans to marry Ghanima to continue the Atreides line<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Leto II manipulates the Bene Gesserit breeding program for his own purposes<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>FREMEN<|>Leto II rules the Fremen and reshapes their society<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>SARDauKAR<|>Leto II secures the loyalty of the Sardaukar through Farad'n<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>IMPERIUM<|>Leto II rules the Imperium and plans its transformation<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>DUNE<|>Leto II draws power and lessons from Dune<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>KRALIZEC<|>Leto II foresees and prepares for Kralizec<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO II<|>GOLDEN PATH<|>Leto II follows the Golden Path to ensure humanity's survival<|>9\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD'N<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Farad'n is trained by the Bene Gesserit<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FARAD'N<|>GHANIMA<|>Farad'n is betrothed to Ghanima as part of Leto II's plan<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>BENE GESSERIT<|>Ghanima is part of the Bene Gesserit breeding program<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREMEN<|>DUNE<|>The Fremen are the native inhabitants of Dune<|>9\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
