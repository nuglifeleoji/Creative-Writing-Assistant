Presently, he said: “What about the city people? Are they in position yet?”\n“Yes,” Stilgar muttered.\nPaul looked at him. “What’s eating you?”\n“I never knew the city man could be trusted completely,” Stilgar said.\n“I was a city man myself once,” Paul said.\nStilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. “Muad’Dib knows | did not mean—”\n“I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn’t what you think he'll do. It’s what he actually does. These city people have Fremen blood. It’s just that they haven’t yet learned how to escape their bondage. We'll teach them.”\nStilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: “The habits of a lifetime, Muad’Dib. On the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the communities.”\nPaul glanced at Gurney, saw him studying Stilgar. “Tell us, Gurney, why were the cityfolk down there driven from their homes by the Sardaukar?”\n“An old trick, my Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees.”\n“It’s been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have forgotten how to fight them,” Paul said. “The Sardaukar have played into our hands. They grabbed some city women for their sport, decorated their battle standards with the heads of the men who objected. And they’ve built up a fever of hate among people who otherwise would’ve looked on the coming battle as no more than a great inconvenience...and the possibility of\nexchanging one set of masters for another. The Sardaukar recruit for us, Stilgar.”\n“The city people do seem eager,” Stilgar said.\n“Their hate is fresh and clear,” Paul said. “That’s why we use them as shock troops.”\n“The slaughter among them will be fearful,” Gurney said. Stilgar nodded agreement.\n“They were told the odds,” Paul said. “They know every Sardaukar they kill will be one less for us. You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for. They’ve discovered they’re a people. They’re awakening.”\nA muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope. Paul moved to the rock slit, asked: “What is it out there?”\n“A great commotion, Muad’Dib,” the watcher hissed. “At that monstrous metal tent. A surface car came from Rimwall West and it was like a hawk into a nest of rock partridge.”\n“Our captive Sardaukar have arrived,” Paul said.\n“They've a shield around the entire landing field now,” the watcher said. “I can see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage yard where they kept the spice.”\n“Now they know who it is they fight,” Gurney said. “Let the Harkonnen beasts tremble and fret themselves that an Atreides yet lives!”\nPaul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope. “Watch the flagpole atop the Emperor's ship. If my flag is raised there—”\n“It will not be,” Gurney said.\nPaul saw the puzzled frown on Stilgar’s face, said: “If the Emperor recognized my claim, he'll signal by restoring the Atreides flag to Arrakis. We’ll use the second plan then, move only against the Harkonnens. The Sardaukar will stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves.”\n“I’ve no experience with these offworld things,” Stilgar said. “I’ve heard of them, but it seems unlikely the—”\n“You don’t need experience to know what they'll do,” Gurney said.\n“They're sending a new flag up on the tall ship,” the watcher said. “The flag is yellow...with a black and red circle in the center.”\n“There’s a subtle piece of business,” Paul said. “The CHOAM Company flag.”\n“It’s the same as the flag at the other ships,” the Fedaykin guard said.\n“I don’t understand,” Stilgar said.\n“A subtle piece of business indeed,” Gurney said. “Had he sent up the Atreides banner, he’d have had to live by what that meant. Too many observers about. He could’ve signaled with the Harkonnen flag on his staff—a flat declaration that’d have been. But, no—he sends up the CHOAM rag. He’s telling the people up there....” Gurney pointed toward space. “... where the profit is. He’s saying he doesn’t care if it’s an Atreides here or not.”\n“How long till the storm strikes the Shield Wall?” Paul asked.\nStilgar turned away, consulted one of the Fedaykin in the bowl. Presently, he returned, said: “Very soon,\nMuad’Dib. Sooner than we expected. It’s a great- great grandmother of a storm...perhaps even more than you wished.”\n“It’s my storm,” Paul said, and saw the silent awe on the faces of the Fedaykin who heard him. “Though it shook the entire world it could not be more than | wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall full on?”\n“Close enough to make no difference,” Stilgar Said.\nA courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin, said: “The Sardaukar and Harkonnen patrols are pulling back, Muad’Dib.”\n“They expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good visibility,” Stilgar said. “They think we'll be in the same fix.”\n“Tell our gunners to set their sights well before visibility drops,” Paul said. “They must knock the nose off every one of those ships as soon as the storm has destroyed the shields.” He stepped to the wall of the bowl, pulled back a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at the sky. The horsetail twistings of blow sand could be seen against the dark of the sky. Paul restored the cover, said: “Start sending our men down, Stil.”\n“Will you not go with us?” Stilgar asked.\n“VII wait here a bit with the Fedaykin,” Paul said.\nStilgar gave a Knowing shrug toward Gurney, moved to the hole in the rock wall, was lost in its shadows.\n“The trigger that blasts the Shield Wall aside, that | leave in your hands, Gurney,” Paul said. “You will do it?”\n“I'll do it.”\nPaul gestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant, said: “Otheym, start moving the check patrols out of the blast area. They must be out of there before the storm strikes.”\nThe man bowed, followed Stilgar.\nGurney leaned in to the rock slit, spoke to the man at the telescope: “Keep your attention on the south wall. It’ll be completely undefended until we blow it.”\n“Dispatch a cielago with a time signal,” Paul ordered.\n“Some ground cars are moving toward the south wall,” the man at the telescope said. “Some are using projectile weapons, testing. Our people are using body shields as you commanded. The ground cars have stopped.”\nIn the abrupt silence, Paul heard the wind devils playing overhead—the front of the storm. Sand began to drift down into their bowl through gaps in the cover. A burst of wind caught the cover, whipped it away.\nPaul motioned his Fedaykin to take shelter, crossed to the men at the communications equipment near the tunnel mouth. Gurney stayed beside him. Paul crouched over the signalmen.\nOne said: “A great-great-great grandmother of a storm, Muad’Dib.”\nPaul glanced up at the darkening sky, said: “Gurney, have the south wall observers pulled out.” He had to repeat his order, shouting above the growing noise of the storm.\nGurney turned to obey.\nPaul fastened his face filter, tightened the stillsuit hood.\nGurney returned.\nPaul touched his shoulder, pointed to the blast trigger set into the tunnel mouth beyond the signalmen. Gurney went into the tunnel, stopped there, one hand at the trigger, his gaze on Paul.\n“We are getting no messages,” the signalman beside Paul said. “Much static.”\nPaul nodded, kept his eye on the time-standard dial in front of the signalman. Presently, Paul looked at Gurney, raised a hand, returned his attention to the dial. The time counter crawled around its final circuit.\n“Now!” Paul shouted, and dropped his hand.\nGurney depressed the blast trigger.\nIt seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath them ripple and shake. A rumbling sound was added to the storm’s roar.\nThe Fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside Paul, the telescope clutched under one arm. “The Shield Wall is breached, Muad’Dib!” he shouted. “The storm is on them and our gunners already are firing.”\nPaul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin, the static charge within the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy camp.\n“The storm!” someone shouted. “We must get under cover, Muad’Dib!”\nPaul came to his senses, feeling the sand needles sting his exposed cheeks. We are committed, he thought. He put an arm around the signalman’s\nshoulder, said: “Leave the equipment! There’s more in the tunnel.” He felt himself being pulled away, Fedaykin pressed around him to protect him. They squeezed into the tunnel mouth, feeling its comparative silence, turned a corner into a small chamber with glowglobes overhead and another tunnel opening beyond.\nAnother signalman sat there at his equipment.\n“Much static,” the man said.\nA swirl of sand filled the air around them.\n“Seal off this tunnel!” Paul shouted. A sudden pressure of stillness showed that his command had been obeyed. “Is the way down to the basin still open?” Paul asked.\nA Fedaykin went to look, returned, said: “The explosion caused a little rock to fall, but the engineers say it is still open. They’re cleaning up with lasbeams.”\n“Tell them to use their hands!” Paul barked. “There are shields active down there!”\n“They are being careful, Muad’Dib,” the man said, but he turned to obey.\nThe signalmen from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment.\n“I told those men to leave their equipment!” Paul said.\n“Fremen do not like to abandon equipment, Muad’Dib,” one of his Fedaykin chided.\n“Men are more important than equipment now,” Paul said. “We'll have more equipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment.”\nGurney Halleck came up beside him, said: “I heard them say the way down is open. We’re very close to the surface here, m’Lord, should the Harkonnens try to retaliate in kind.”\n“They're in no position to retaliate,” Paul said. “They're just now finding out that they have no shields and are unable to get off Arrakis.”\n“The new command post is all prepared, though, m’Lord,” Gurney said.\n“They've no need of me in the command post yet,” Paul said. “The plan would go ahead without me. We must wait for the—”\n“l'm getting a message, Muad’Dib,” said the signalman at the communications equipment. The man shook his head, pressed a receiver phone against his ear. “Much static!” He began scribbling on a pad in front of him, shaking his head waiting, writing...waiting.\nPaul crossed to the signalman’s side. The Fedaykin Stepped back, giving him room. He looked down at what the man had written, read:\n“Raid...on Sietch", "Lord, should the Harkonnens try to retaliate in kind.”\n“They're in no position to retaliate,” Paul said. “They're just now finding out that they have no shields and are unable to get off Arrakis.”\n“The new command post is all prepared, though, m’Lord,” Gurney said.\n“They've no need of me in the command post yet,” Paul said. “The plan would go ahead without me. We must wait for the—”\n“l'm getting a message, Muad’Dib,” said the signalman at the communications equipment. The man shook his head, pressed a receiver phone against his ear. “Much static!” He began scribbling on a pad in front of him, shaking his head waiting, writing...waiting.\nPaul crossed to the signalman’s side. The Fedaykin Stepped back, giving him room. He looked down at what the man had written, read:\n“Raid...on Sietch Tabr...captives...Alia (blank) families of (blank) dead are...they (blank) son of Muad’Dib....”\nAgain, the signalman shook his head.\nPaul looked up to see Gurney staring at him.\n“The message is garbled,” Gurney said. “The Static. You don’t know that....”\n“My son is dead,” Paul said, and knew as he spoke that it was true. “My son is dead...and Alia is a captive...hostage.” He felt emptied, a shell without emotions. Everything he touched brought death and\ngrief. And it was like a disease that could spread across the universe.\nHe could feel the old-man wisdom, the accumulation out of the experiences from countless possible lives. Something seemed to chuckle and rub its hands within him.\nAnd Paul thought: How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!\nAnd Muad’Dib stood before them, and he said: “Though we deem the captive dead, yet does she live. For her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice. And she sees unto the farthest reaches of possibility. Yea, unto the vale of the unknowable does she see because of me.”\n—FROM “ARRAKIS AWAKENING” BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\nhe Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood with eyes\ndowncast in the Imperial audience chamber, the oval selamlik within the Padishah Emperor’s hutment. With covert glances, the Baron had studied the metal-walled room and its occupants—the noukkers, the pages, the guards, the troop of House Sardaukar drawn up around the walls, standing at ease there beneath the bloody and tattered captured battle flags that were the room’s only decoration.\nVoices sounded from the right of the chamber, echoing out of a high passage: “Make way! Make way for the Royal Person!”\nThe Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV came out of the passage into the audience chamber followed by his suite. He stood waiting while his throne was brought, ignoring the Baron, seemingly ignoring every person in the room.\nThe Baron found that he could not ignore the Royal Person, and studied the Emperor for a sign, any clue to the purpose of this audience. The Emperor\nstood poised, waiting—a slim, elegant figure in a gray Sardaukar uniform with silver and gold trim. His thin face and cold eyes reminded the Baron of the Duke Leto long dead. There was that same look of the predatory bird. But the Emperor’s hair was red, not black, and most of that hair was concealed by a Burseg’s ebon helmet with the Imperial crest in gold upon its crown.\nPages brought the throne. It was a massive chair carved from a single piece of Hagal quartz—blue- green translucency shot through with streaks of yellow fire. They placed it on the dais and the Emperor mounted, seated himself.\nAn old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead detached herself from the Emperor’s suite, took up station behind the throne, one scrawny hand resting on the quartz back. Her face peered out of the hood like a witch caricature—sunken cheeks and eyes, an overlong nose, skin mottled and with protruding veins.\nThe Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her. The presence of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Emperor’s Truthsayer, betrayed the importance of this audience. The Baron looked away from her, studied the suite for a clue. There were two of the Guild agents, one tall and fat, one short and fat, both with bland gray eyes. And among the lackeys stood one of the Emperor’s daughters, the Princess Irulan, a woman they said was being trained in the deepest of the Bene Gesserit ways, destined to be a Reverend Mother. She was tall, blonde, face of\nchiseled beauty, green eyes that looked past and through him.\n“My dear Baron.”\nThe Emperor had deigned to notice him. The voice was baritone and with exquisite control. It managed to dismiss him while greeting him.\nThe Baron bowed low, advanced to the required position ten paces from the dais. “I came at your summons, Majesty.”\n“Summons!” the old witch cackled.\n“Now, Reverend Mother,” the Emperor chided, but he smiled at the Baron’s discomfiture, said: “First, you will tell me where you've sent your minion, Thufir Hawat.”\nThe Baron darted his gaze left and right, reviled himself for coming here without his own guards, not that they’d be much use against Sardaukar. Still...\n“Well?” the Emperor said.\n“He has been gone these five days, Majesty.” The Baron shot a glance at the Guild agents, back to the Emperor. “He was to land at a smuggler base and attempt infiltrating the camp of the Fremen fanatic, this Muad’Dib.”\n“Incredible!” the Emperor said.\nOne of the witch’s clawlike hands tapped the Emperor’s shoulder. She leaned forward, whispered in his ear.\nThe Emperor nodded, said: “Five days, Baron. Tell me, why aren’t you worried about his absence?”\n“But | am worried, Majesty!”\nThe Emperor continued to stare at him, waiting. The Reverend Mother emitted a cackling laugh.\n“What | mean, Majesty,” the Baron said, “is that Hawat will be dead within another few hours, anyway.” And he explained about the latent poison and need for an antidote.\n“How clever of you, Baron,” the Emperor said. “And where are your nephews, Rabban and the young Feyd-Rautha?”\n“The storm comes, Majesty. | sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the Fremen attack under cover of the sand.”\n“Perimeter,” the Emperor said. The word came out as though it puckered his mouth. “The storm won’t be much here in the basin, and that Fremen rabble won’t attack while I’m here with five legions of Sardaukar.”\n“Surely not, Majesty,” the Baron said. “But error on the side of caution cannot be censured.”\n“Ah-h-h-h,” the Emperor said. “Censure. Then I’m not to speak of how much time this Arrakis nonsense has taken from me? Nor the CHOAM Company profits pouring down this rat hole? Nor the court functions and affairs of state I’ve had to delay—even cancel— because of this stupid affair?”\nThe Baron lowered his gaze, frightened by the Imperial anger. The delicacy of his position here, alone and dependent upon the Convention and the dictum familia of the Great Houses, fretted him. Does he mean to kill me? the Baron asked himself. He couldn't! Not with the other Great Houses waiting up there, aching for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis.\n“Have you taken hostages?” the Emperor asked.\n“It’s useless, Majesty,” the Baron said. “These mad Fremen hold a burial ceremony for every captive and act as though such a one were already dead.”\n“So?” the Emperor said.\nAnd the Baron waited, glancing left and right at the metal walls of the selamlik, thinking of the monstrous fanmetal tent around him. Such unlimited wealth it represented that even the Baron was awed. He brings pages, the Baron thought, and useless court lackeys, his women and their companions—hair- dressers, designers, everything...all the fringe parasites of the Court. All here—fawning, slyly plotting, “roughing it” with the Emperor...here to watch him put an end to this affair, to make epigrams over the battles and idolize the wounded.\n“Perhaps you've never sought the right kind of hostages,” the Emperor said.\nHe knows something, the Baron thought. Fear sat like a stone in his stomach until he could hardly bear the thought of eating. Yet, the feeling was like hunger, and he poised himself several times in his Suspensors on the point of ordering food brought to him. But there was no one here to obey his summons.\n“Do you have any idea who this Muad’Dib could be?” the Emperor asked.\n“One of the Umma, surely,” the Baron said. “A Fremen fanatic, a religious adventurer. They crop up regularly on the fringes of civilization. Your Majesty knows this.”\nThe Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer, turned back to scowl at the Baron. “And you have no other knowledge of this Muad’Dib?”\n“A madman,” the Baron said. “But all Fremen are a little mad.”\n“Mad?”\n“His people scream his name as they leap into battle. The women throw their babies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to open a wedge for their men to attack us. They have no...no...decency!”\n“AS bad as that,” the Emperor murmured, and his tone of derision did not escape the Baron. “Tell me, my dear Baron, have you investigated the southern polar regions of Arrakis?”\nThe Baron stared up at the Emperor, shocked by the change of subject. “But...well, you know, Your Majesty, the entire region is uninhabitable, open to wind and worm. There’s not even any spice in those latitudes.”\n“You’ve had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery appear there?”\n“There’ve always been such reports. Some were investigated—long ago. A few plants were seen. Many ‘thopters were lost. Much too costly, Your Majesty. It’s a place where men cannot survive for long.”\n“So,” the Emperor said. He snapped his fingers and a door opened at his left behind the throne. Through the door came two Sardaukar herding a girl- child who appeared to be about four years old. She wore a black aba, the hood thrown back to reveal the attachments of a stillsuit hanging free at her throat. Her eyes were Fremen blue, staring out of a soft, round face. She appeared completely unafraid and there was a look to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for no reason he could explain.\nEven the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made a warding sign in her direction. The old witch obviously was shaken by the child’s presence.\nThe Emperor cleared his throat to speak, but the child spoke first—a thin voice with traces of a soft- palate lisp, but clear nonetheless. “So here he is,” she said. She advanced to the edge of the dais. “He doesn’t appear much, does he—one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help of suspensors.”\nIt was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child that the Baron stared at her, speechless in spite of his anger. /s it a midget? he asked himself.\n“My dear Baron,” the Emperor said, “", ", staring out of a soft, round face.

There was such an air of sureness in the way she appraised her surroundings.\nThe Baron stared at the kicking feet, the way they moved the black robe, the wink of sandals beneath the fabric.\n“Unfortunately,” the Emperor said, “I only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men. This child here was in command of one of the attacking groups.”\n“You see, Your Majesty!” the Baron said. “You see how they are!”\n“I allowed myself to be captured,” the child said. “I did not want to face my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed.”\n“Only a handful of our men got away,” the Emperor said. “Got away! You hear that?”\n“We'd have had them, too,” the child said, “except for the flames.”\n“My Sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as flame-throwers,” the Emperor said. “A move of desperation and the only thing that got them away with their three prisoners. Mark that, my dear Baron: Sardaukar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children and old men!”\n“We must attack in force,” the Baron rasped. “We must destroy every last vestige of—”\n“Silence!” the Emperor roared. He pushed himself forward on his throne. “Do not abuse my intelligence any longer. You stand there in your foolish innocence and—”\n“Majesty,” the old Truthsayer said.\nHe waved her to silence. “You say you don’t know about the activity we found, nor the fighting qualities of these superb people!” The Emperor lifted himself half off his throne. “What do you take me for, Baron?”\nThe Baron took two backward steps, thinking: /t was Rabban. He has done this to me. Rabban has....\n“And this fake dispute with Duke Leto,” the Emperor purred, sinking back into his throne. “How beautifully you maneuvered it.”\n“Majesty,” the Baron pleaded. “What are you—”\n“Silence!”\nThe old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor’s shoulder, leaned close to whisper in his ear.\nThe child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet, said: “Make him afraid some more, Shaddam. | shouldn't enjoy this, but | find the pleasure impossible to suppress.”\n“Quiet, child,” the Emperor said. He leaned forward, put a hand on her head, stared at the Baron. “Is it possible, Baron? Could you be as simpleminded as my Truthsayer suggests? Do you not recognize this child, daughter of your ally, Duke Leto?”\n“My father was never his ally,” the child said. “My father is dead and this old Harkonnen beast has never seen me before.”\nThe Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it was only to rasp: “Who?”\n“I am Alia, daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister of Duke Paul-Muad’Dib,” the child said. She pushed herself off the dais, dropped to the floor\nof the audience chamber. “My brother has promised to have your head atop his battle standard and | think he shall.”\n“Be hush, child,” the Emperor said, and he sank back into his throne, hand to chin, studying the Baron.\n“I do not take the Emperor’s orders,” Alia said. She turned, looked up at the old Reverend Mother. “She knows.”\nThe Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer. “What does she mean?”\n“That child is an abomination!” the old woman said. “Her mother deserves a punishment greater than anything in history. Death! It cannot come too quickly for that chi/d or for the one who spawned her!” The old woman pointed a finger at Alia. “Get out of my mind!”\n“T-P?” the Emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. “By the Great Mother!”\n“You don’t understand, Majesty,” the old woman said. “Not telepathy. She’s in my mind. She’s like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!”\n“What others?” the Emperor demanded. “What’s this nonsense?”\nThe old woman straightened, lowered her pointing hand. “I’ve said too much, but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us.”\n“You babble, old woman,” Alia said. “You don’t know how it was, yet you rattle on like a purblind fool.” Alia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and held it.\nThe old Reverend Mother groaned and staggered. Alia opened her eyes. “That is how it was,” she said. “A cosmic accident...and you played your part in\nit.”\nThe Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushing the air toward Alia.\n“What is happening here?” the Emperor demanded. “Child, can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another?”\n“That’s not how it is at all,” Alia said. “Unless I’m born as you, | cannot think as you.”\n“Kill her,” the old woman muttered, and clutched the back of the throne for support. “Kill her!” The sunken old eyes glared at Alia.\n“Silence,” the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. “Child, can you communicate with your brother?”\n“My brother knows I’m here,” Alia said.\n“Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?”\nAlia smiled up at him with clear innocence. “I shall not do that,” she said.\nThe Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia. “Majesty,” he pleaded, “I knew nothing of—”\n“Interrupt me once more, Baron,” the Emperor said, “and you will lose the powers of interruption... forever.” He kept his attention focused on Alia, Studying her through slitted lids. “You will not, eh?\nCan you read in my mind what l'Il do if you disobey me?”\n“I’ve already said | cannot read minds,” she said, “but one doesn’t need telepathy to read your intentions.”\nThe Emperor scowled. “Child, your cause is hopeless. | have but to rally my forces and reduce this planet to—”\n“It’s not that simple,” Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. “Ask them.”\n“It is not wise to go against my desires,” the Emperor said. “You should not deny me the least thing.”\n“My brother comes now,” Alia said. “Even an Emperor may tremble before Muad’Dib, for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him.”\nThe Emperor surged to his feet. “This play has gone far enough. | will take your brother and this planet and grind them to—”\nThe room rumbled and shook around them. There came a sudden cascade of sand behind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the Emperor’s ship. The abrupt flicker-tightening of skin pressure told of a wide-area shield being activated.\n“I told you,” Alia said. “My brother comes.”\nThe Emperor stood in front of his throne, right hand pressed to right ear, the servo-receiver there chattering its report on the situation. The Baron moved two steps behind Alia. Sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors.\n“We will fall back into space and re-form,” the Emperor said. “Baron, my apologies. These madmen are attacking under cover of the storm. We will show them an Emperor's wrath, then.” He pointed at Alia. “Give her body to the storm.”\nAs he spoke, Alia fled backward, feigning terror. “Let the storm have what it can take!” she screamed. And she backed into the Baron’s arms.\n“| have her, Majesty!” the Baron shouted. “Shall | dispatch her now-eeeeeeeeeeeh!” He hurled her to the floor, clutched his left arm.\n“l'm sorry, Grandfather,” Alia said. “You’ve met the Atreides gom Jabbar.” She got to her feet, dropped a dark needle from her hand.\nThe Baron fell back. His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left palm. “You...you....” He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open.\n“These people are insane,” the Emperor snarled. “Quick! Into the ship. We'll purge this planet of every...”\nSomething sparkled to his left. A roll of ball lightning bounced away from the wall there, crackled as it touched the metal floor. The smell of burned insulation swept through the selamlik.\n“The shield!” one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. “The outer shield is down! They....”\nHis words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the Emperor trembled and rocked.\n“They've shot the nose off our ship!” someone called.\nDust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward the outer door.\nThe Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ship’s side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. “We will make our stand here!” the Emperor ordered.\nAnother crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber admitting windblown sand and the sound of shouting. A small, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light—Alia darting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect the Emperor’s retreat.\n"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_6481f31e48c326fa617ee8ace7af8ed55a80a88e16ff5c593e17196fd30abe39_v2"}
