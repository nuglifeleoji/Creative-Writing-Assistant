See that it’s the best you can arrange.”\n“Owe you...” Bellonda started to splutter.\n“A peace offering,” Odrade said. “I want it served in my gazebo... my Fancy Folly.”\nWhen Sheeana laughed, Bellonda was forced to join but with an icy edge. She knew when she had been out-faced.\n“Everyone will see it and say: ‘See how confident Mother Superior is,’” Sheeana said.\n“So you want it for morale!” At this point, Bellonda would have accepted almost any justification.\nOdrade beamed at Sheeana. My clever little darling! Not only had Sheeana ceased teasing Bellonda, she had taken to reinforcing the older woman’s self-esteem wherever possible. Bell knew it, of course, and there remained an inevitable Bene Gesserit question: Why?\nRecognizing the suspicion, Sheeana said: “We're really arguing about Miles and Duncan. And I, for one, am sick of it.”\n“If | just knew what you were really doing, Dar!” Bellonda said.\n“Energy has its own patterns, Bell!”\n“What do you mean?” Quite startled.\n“They are going to find us, Bell. And | know how.”\nBellonda actually gaped.\n“We are slaves of our habits,” Odrade said. “Slaves of energies we create. Can slaves break free? Bell, you know the problem as well as | do.”\nFor once, Bellonda was nonplussed.\nOdrade stared at her.\nPride, that was what Odrade saw when she looked at her Sisters and their places. Dignity was only a mask. No real humility. Instead, there was this visible conformity, a true Bene Gesserit pattern that, in a society aware of the peril in patterns, sounded a warning klaxon.\nSheeana was confused. “Habits?”\n“Your habits always come hunting after you. The self you construct will haunt you. A ghost wandering around in search of your body, eager to possess you. We are addicted to the self we construct. Slaves to what we have done. We are addicted to Honored Matres and they to us!”\n“More of your damned romanticism!” Bellonda said.\n“Yes, I’m a romantic... in the same way the Tyrant was. He sensitized himself to the fixed shape of his creation. | am sensitive to his prescient trap.”\nBut oh how close the hunter and oh how deep the pit.\nBellonda was not placated. “You said you know how they will find us.”\n“They have only to recognize their own habits and they... Yes?” This was to an acolyte messenger emerging from a covered passage behind Bellonda.\n“Mother Superior, it’s Reverend Mother Dortujla. Mother Fintil has brought her to the Landing Flat and they will be here within the hour.”\n“Bring her to my workroom!” Odrade looked at Bellonda with a stare that was almost wild. “Has she said anything?”\n“Mother Dortujla is ill,” the acolyte said.\nIll? What an extraordinary thing to say about a Reverend Mother.\n“Reserve judgment.” It was Bellonda-Mentat speaking, Bellonda foe of romanticism and wild imagination.\n“Get Tam up there as an observer,” Odrade said.\nDortujla hobbled in on a cane with Fintil and Streggi helping her. There was a firmness to Dortujla’s eyes, though, and a sense of measuring behind every look she focused on her surroundings. She had her hood thrown back revealing\nhair the dark mottled brown of antique ivory and when she spoke her voice conveyed a sense of fatigue.\n“| have done as you ordered, Mother Superior.” As Fintil and Streggi left the room, Dortujla sat without being invited, a slingchair beside Bellonda. Brief glances at Sheeana and Tamalane on her left, then a hard stare at Odrade. “They will meet with you on Junction. They think the place is their own idea and your Spider Queen is there!”\n“How soon?” Sheeana asked.\n“They want one hundred Standard days counting from just about now. | can be more precise if you want.”\n“Why so long?” Odrade asked.\n“My opinion? They will use the time to reinforce their defenses on Junction.”\n“What guarantees?” That was Tam, terse as usual.\n“Dortujla, what has happened to you?” Odrade was shocked by the trembling weakness apparent in the woman.\n“They conducted experiments on me. But that is not important. The arrangements are. For what it’s worth, they promise you safe passage in and out of Junction. Don’t believe it. You are allowed a small entourage of servants, no more than five. Assume they will kill everyone who accompanies you, although... | may have taught them the error in that.”\n“They expect me to bring submission of the Bene Gesserit?” Odrade’s voice had never been colder. Dortujla’s words raised a specter of tragedy.\n“That was the inducement.”\n“The Sisters who went with you?” Sheeana asked.\nDortujla tapped her forehead, a common Sisterhood gesture. “| have them. We agree the Honored Matres should be punished.”\n“Dead?” Odrade forced the word between tight lips.\n“Attempting to force me into their ranks. ‘You see? We will kill another one if you don’t agree.’ | told them to kill us all and have done with it and to forget about meeting Mother\nSuperior. They did not accept this until they ran out of hostages.”\n“You Shared them all?” Tamalane asked. Yes, that would be Tam’s concern as she neared her own death.\n“While pretending to assure myself they were dead. You may as well know the whole thing. These women are grotesque! They possess caged Futars. The bodies of my Sisters were thrown into the cages where the Futars ate them. The Spider Queen—an appropriate name—made me watch this.”\n“Disgusting!” Bellonda said.\nDortujla sighed. “They did not know, naturally, that | have worse visions in Other Memory.”\n“They sought to overwhelm your sensibilities,” Odrade said. “Foolish. Were they surprised when you didn’t react as they wished?”\n“Chagrined, | would say. | think they had seen others react as | did. | told them it was as good a way as any to get fertilizer. | believe that angered them.”\n“Cannibalism,” Tamalane muttered.\n“Only in appearance,” Dortujla said. “Futars definitely are not human. Barely tamed wild animals.”\n“No Handlers?” Odrade asked.\n“I saw none. The Futars did speak. They said, ‘Eat!’ before they ate and they jibed at Honored Matres around them. ‘You hungry?’ That sort of thing. More important was what happened after they ate.”\nDortujla lapsed into a fit of coughing. “They tried poisons,” she said. “Stupid women!”\nWhen she regained her breath, Dortujla said, “A Futar came to the bars of its cage after their .. . banquet? It looked at the Spider Queen and it screamed. | have never heard such a sound. Chilling! Every Honored Matre in that room froze and | swear to you they were terrified.”\nSheeana touched Dortujla’s arm. “A predator immobilizing its prey?”\n“Undoubtedly. It had qualities of Voice. The Futars appeared surprised that it did not freeze me.”\n“The Honored Matres’ reaction?” Bellonda asked. Yes, a Mentat would require that datum.\n“A general clamor when they found their voices. Many shouted for Great Honored Matre to destroy the Futars. She, however, took a calmer view. ‘Too valuable alive,’ she said.”\n“A hopeful sign,” Tamalane said.\nOdrade looked at Bellonda. “I will order Streggi to bring the Bashar here. Objections?”\nBellonda gave a curt nod. They knew the gamble must be taken despite questions about Teg’s intentions.\nTo Dortujla, Odrade said: “I want you in my own guest quarters. We'll bring in Suks. Order what you need and prepare for a full Council meeting. You are a special advisor.”\nDortujla spoke while struggling to her feet. “I’ve not slept in almost fifteen days and | will need a special meal.”\n“Sheeana, see to that and get the Suks up here. Tam, stay with the Bashar and Streggi. Regular reports. He’ll want to go to the cantonment and take personal charge. Get him a comlink with Duncan. Nothing must impede them.”\n“You want me here with him?” Tamalane asked.\n“You are his leech. Streggi takes him nowhere without your knowledge. He wants Duncan as Weapons Master. Make sure he accepts Duncan’s confinement in the ship. Bell, any weapons data Duncan requires—priority. Comments?”\nThere were no comments. Thoughts about consequences, yes, but the decisiveness of Odrade’s behavior infected them.\nSitting back, Odrade closed her eyes and waited until silence told her she was alone. The comeyes were still watching, of course.\nThey know I’m tired. Who wouldn’t be under these circumstances? Three more Sisters killed by those\nmonsters! Bashar! They must feel our lash and know the lesson!\nWhen she heard Streggi arrive with Teg, Odrade opened her eyes. Streggi led him in by the hand but there was something about them saying this was not an adult guiding a child. Teg’s movements said he gave Streggi permission to treat him this way. She would have to be warned.\nTam followed and went to a chair near the windows directly beneath the bust of Chenoeh. Significant positioning? Tam did strange things lately.\n“Do you wish me to stay, Mother Superior?” Streggi released Teg’s hand and stood near the door.\n“Sit over there beside Tam. Listen and do not interrupt. You must know what will be required of you.”\nTeg hitched himself onto the chair recently occupied by Dortujla. “I suppose this is a council of war.”\nThat’s an adult behind the childish voice.\n“I won’t ask your plan yet,” Odrade said.\n“Good. The unexpected takes more time and | may not be able to tell you what | intend until the moment of action.”\n“We've been observing you with Duncan. Why are you interested in ships from the Scattering?”\n“Long-haul ships have a distinctive appearance. | saw them on the flat at Gammu.”\nTeg sat back and let this sink in, glad of the briskness he sensed in Odrade’s manner. Decisions! No long deliberations. That suited his needs. They must not learn the full extent of my abilities. Not yet.\n“You would disguise an attack force?”\nBellonda came through the door as Odrade was speaking and growled an objection while sitting: “Impossible! They'll have recognition codes and secret signals for—”\n“Let me decide that, Bell, or remove me from command.”\n“This is the Council!” Bellonda said. “You don’t—”\n“Mentat?” He looked fully at her, the Bashar apparent in his gaze.\nWhen she fell silent, he said: “Don’t question my loyalty! If you would weaken me, replace me!”\n“Let him have his say.” That was Tam. “This isn’t the first Council where the Bashar has appeared as our equal.”\nBellonda lowered her chin a fractional millimeter.\nTo Odrade, Teg said, “Avoiding warfare is a matter of intelligence—the gathered variety and intellectual power.”\nThrow", " long deliberations. That suited his needs. They must not learn the full extent of my abilities. Not yet.\n“You would disguise an attack force?”\nBellonda came through the door as Odrade was speaking and growled an objection while sitting: “Impossible! They'll have recognition codes and secret signals for—”\n“Let me decide that, Bell, or remove me from command.”\n“This is the Council!” Bellonda said. “You don’t—”\n“Mentat?” He looked fully at her, the Bashar apparent in his gaze.\nWhen she fell silent, he said: “Don’t question my loyalty! If you would weaken me, replace me!”\n“Let him have his say.” That was Tam. “This isn’t the first Council where the Bashar has appeared as our equal.”\nBellonda lowered her chin a fractional millimeter.\nTo Odrade, Teg said, “Avoiding warfare is a matter of intelligence—the gathered variety and intellectual power.”\nThrowing our own cant at us! She heard Mentat in his voice and Bellonda obviously heard this as well. Intelligence and intelligence: the doubled view. Without it, warfare often occurred as an accident.\nThe Bashar sat silently, letting them stew in their own historical observations. The urge to conflict went far deeper than consciousness. The Tyrant had been right. Humankind acted as “one beast.” The forces impelling that great collective animal went back to tribal days and beyond, as did so many forces to which humans responded without thinking.\nMix the genes.\nExpand Lebensraum for your own breeders.\nGather the energies of others: collect slaves, peons, servants, serfs, markets, workers... The terms often were interchangeable.\nOdrade saw what he was doing. Knowledge absorbed from the Sisterhood helped make him the incomparable Mentat Bashar. He held these things as instincts. Energy- eating drove war’s violence. This was described as “greed, fear (that others will take your hoard), power hunger” and on and on into futile analyses. Odrade had heard these even from Bellonda who obviously was not taking it well that a subordinate should remind them of what they already knew.\n“The Tyrant knew,” Teg said. “Duncan quotes him: ‘War is behavior with roots in the single cell of the primeval seas. Eat whatever you touch or it will eat you.’”\n“What do you propose?” Bellonda at her most snappish.\n“A feint at Gammu, then strike their base on Junction. For that we need first-hand observations.” He stared steadily at Odrade.\nHe knows! The thought flared in Odrade’s mind.\n“You think your studies of Junction when it was a Guild base are still accurate?” Bellonda demanded.\n“They haven't had time to change the place much from what | stored here.” He tapped his forehead in an odd parody of the Sisterhood’s gesture.\n“Englobement,” Odrade said.\nBellonda looked at her sharply. “The cost!”\n“Losing everything is more costly,” Teg said.\n“Foldspace sensors don’t have to be large,” Odrade said. “Duncan would set them to create a Holzmann explosion on contact?”\n“The explosions would be visible and would give us a trajectory.” He sat back and looked at an indefinite area on Odrade’s rear wall. Would they accept it? He dared not frighten them with another display of wild talent. If Bell knew he could see the no-ships!\n“Do it!” Odrade said. “You have the command. Use it.”\nThere was a distinct sense of chuckling from Taraza in Other Memories. Give him his head! That’s how | got such a great reputation!\n“One thing,” Bellonda said. She looked at Odrade. “You're going to be his spy?”\n“Who else can get in there and transmit observations?”\n“They'll be monitoring every means of transmission!”\n“Even the one that tells our waiting no-ship we have not been betrayed?” Odrade asked.\n“An encrypted message hidden in the transmission,” Teg said. “Duncan has devised an encryption that would take months to break but we doubt they'll detect its presence.”\n“Madness,” Bellonda muttered.\n“I met an Honored Matre military commander on Gammu,” Teg said. “Slack when it came to necessary\ndetails. | think they’re overconfident.”\nBellonda stared at him and there was the Bashar staring back at her out of a child’s innocent eyes. “Abandon all sanity ye who enter here,” he said.\n“Get out of here, all of you!” Odrade ordered. “You have work to do. And Miles...”\nHe already had slid off the chair but he stood there looking much as he always had when waiting for Mother to tell him something important.\n“Did you refer to the lunacy of dramatic events that warfare always amplifies?”\n“What else? Surely you didn’t think | referred to your Sisterhood!”\n“Duncan plays this game sometimes.”\n“| don’t want us catching the Honored Matre madness,” Teg said. “It is contagious, you know.”\n“They've tried to control the sex drive,” Odrade said. “That always gets away from you.”\n“Runaway lunacy,” he agreed. He leaned against the table, his chin barely above the surface. “Something drove those women back here. Duncan’s right. They’re looking for something and running away at the same time.”\n“You have ninety Standard days to get ready,” she said. “Not one day more.”\nIsh yara al-ahdab hadbat-u. (A hunchback does not see his own hunch.— Folk Saying.) Bene Gesserit Commentary: The hunch may be seen with the aid of mirrors but mirrors may show the whole being.\n—THE BASHAR TEG\nt was a weakness in the Bene Gesserit that Odrade knew\nthe entire Sisterhood soon must recognize. She gained no consolation from having seen it first. Denying our deepest resource when we need it most! The Scatterings had gone beyond the ability of humans to assemble the experiences in manageable form. We can only extract essentials, and that is a matter of judgment. Vital data would remain dormant in great and small events, accumulations called instinct. So that was it finally—they must fall back on unspoken knowledge.\nIn this age, the word “refugees” took on the color of its pre-space meaning. Small bands of Reverend Mothers sent out by the Sisterhood held something in common with old scenes of displaced stragglers trudging down forgotten roads, pitiful belongings bound in bits of cloth, wheeled on decrepit prams and toy wagons, or piled atop lopsided vehicles, remnant humanity clinging to the outsides and densely packed within, every face blank with despair or heated by desperation.\nSo we repeat history and repeat it and repeat it.\nAs she entered a tubeslot shortly before lunch, Odrade’s thoughts clung to her Scattered Sisters: political refugees, economic refugees, pre-battle refugees.\nIs this your Golden Path, Tyrant?\nVisions of her Scattered ones haunted Odrade as she entered Central’s Reserved Dining Room, a place only Reverend Mothers might enter. They served themselves here at cafeteria lines.\nIt had been twenty days since she had released Teg to the cantonment. Rumors were flying in Central, especially among Proctors, although there still was no sign of another vote. New decisions must be announced today and they would have to be more than naming the ones who would accompany her to Junction.\nShe glanced around the dining room, an austere place of yellow walls, low ceiling, small square tables that could be latched in rows for larger groups. Windows along one side revealed a garden court under a translucent cover. Dwarf apricots in green fruit, lawn, benches, small tables. Sisters ate outside when sunlight poured into the enclosed yard. No sunlight today.\nShe ignored a cafeteria line where a place was being made for her. Later, Sisters.\nAt the corner table near the windows reserved for her, she deliberately moved the chairs. Bell’s brown chairdog pulsed faintly at this unaccustomed disturbance. Odrade sat with her back to the room, Knowing this would be interpreted correctly: Leave me to my own thoughts.\nWhile she waited, she stared out at the courtyard. An enclosing hedge of exotic purple-leaved shrubs was in red flower—giant blossoms with delicate stamens of deep yellow.\nBellonda arrived first, dropping into her chairdog with no comment on its new position. Bell frequently appeared untidy, belt loose, robe wrinkled, bits of food on the bosom. Today, she was neat and clean.\nNow, why is that?\nBellonda said, “Tam and Sheeana will be late.”\nOdrade accepted this without stopping her study of this different Bellonda. Was she a bit slimmer? There was no way\nto insulate a Mother Superior completely from what went on within her sensory area of concerns but sometimes pressures of work distracted her from small changes. These were a Reverend Mother’s natural habitat, though, and negative evidence was as illuminating as positive. On reflection, Odrade realized that this new Bellonda had been with them for several weeks.\nSomething had happened to Bellonda. Any Reverend Mother could exercise reasonable control over weight and figure. A matter of internal chemistry—banking fires or letting them burn high. For years now, rebellious Bellonda had flaunted a gross body.\n“You've lost weight,” Odrade said.\n“Fat was beginning to slow me too much.”\nThat had never been sufficient reason for Bell to change her ways. She had always compensated with speed of mind, with projections and faster transport.\n“Duncan really got to you, didn’t he?”\n“I’m not a hypocrite nor criminal!”\n“Time to send you to a punishment Keep, | guess.”\nThis recurrent humorous thrust usually annoyed Bellonda. Today, it did not arouse her. But under pressure of Odrade’s stare, she said: “If you must know, it’s Sheeana. She has been after me to improve my appearance and broaden my circle of associates. Annoying! I’m doing it to shut her up.”\n“Why are Tam and Sheeana late?”\n“Reviewing your latest meeting with Duncan. | have severely limited who has access to it. No telling what will happen when it becomes general knowledge.”\n“As it will.”\n“Inevitable. | only buy us time to prepare.”\n“| did not want it suppressed, Bell.”\n“Dar, what are you doing?”\n“I will announce that at a Convocation.”\nNo words but Bellonda glared her surprise.\n“A Convocation is my right,” Odrade said.\nBellonda leaned back and stared at Odrade, assessing, questioning . . . all without words. The last Convocation of the Bene Gesserit had been at the Tyrant’s death. And before that, at the Tyrant’s seizure of power. A Convocation had not been thought possible since Honored Matres attacked. Too much time taken from desperate labors.\nPresently, Bellonda asked: “Will you risk bringing Sisters from our surviving Keeps?”\n“No. Dortujla will represent them. There is precedent, as you know.”\n“First, you free Murbella; now it’s a Convocation.”\n“Free? Murbella is tied by chains of gold. Where would she go without her Duncan?”\n“But you've given Duncan freedom to leave the ship!”\n“Has he?”\nBellonda said, “You think that information from the ship’s armory is all he’ll take?”\n“I know it.”\n“lam reminded of Jessica turning her back on the Mentat who would have killed her.”\n“The Mentat was immobilized by his own beliefs.”\n“Sometimes the bull gores the matador, Dar.”\n“More often he does not.”\n“Our survival", " at the Tyrant’s seizure of power. A Convocation had not been thought possible since Honored Matres attacked. Too much time taken from desperate labors.\nPresently, Bellonda asked: “Will you risk bringing Sisters from our surviving Keeps?”\n“No. Dortujla will represent them.

That is why | call Convocation.”\n“Acolytes included?”\n“Everyone.”\n“Even Murbella? Does she get an acolyte’s vote?”\n“I think she may be a Reverend Mother by then.”\nBellonda gasped, then: “You move too fast, Dar!”\n“These times require it.”\nBellonda glanced toward the dining room door. “Here’s Tam. Later than | expected. | wonder if they took time to consult Murbella?”\nTamalane arrived, breathing hard from hurrying. She dropped into her blue chairdog, noted the new positions and\nsaid: “Sheeana will be along presently. She is showing records to Murbella.”\nBellonda addressed Tamalane. “She’s going to put Murbella through the Agony and call a Convocation.”\n“I’m not surprised.” Tamalane spoke with her old precision. “The position of that Honored Matre must be resolved as soon as possible.”\nSheeana joined them then and took the slingchair at Odrade’s left, soeaking as she sat. “Have you watched Murbella walk?”\nOdrade was caught by the way this abrupt question, uttered without preamble, fixed the attention. Murbella walking in the ship. Observed just that morning. Beauty in Murbella and the eye could not avoid it. To other Bene Gesserit, Reverend Mothers and acolytes alike, she was something of an exotic. She had arrived full-grown from the dangerous Outside. One of them. It was her movements, though, that compelled the eye. Homeostasis in her that went beyond the norms.\nSheeana’s question redirected the observer’s mind. Something about Murbella’s quite acceptable passage required new examination. What was it?\nMurbella’s motions were always carefully chosen. She excluded anything not required to go from here to there. Path of least resistance? It was a view of Murbella that sent a pang through Odrade. Sheeana had seen it, of course. Was Murbella one of those who would choose an easy way every time? Odrade could see that question on the faces of her companions.\n“The Agony will sort it out,” Tamalane said.\nOldrade looked squarely at Sheeana. “Well?” She had asked the question, after all.\n“Perhaps it’s only that she does not waste energy. But | agree with Tam: the Agony.”\n“Are we making a terrible mistake?” Bellonda asked.\nSomething in the way this question was asked told Odrade that Bell had made a Mentat summation. She has seen what | intend!\n“If you Know a better course reveal it now,” Odrade said. Or hold your peace.\nSilence gripped them. Odrade looked at her companions in succession, lingering on Bell.\nHelp us, whatever gods there may be! And I, being Bene Gesserit, am too much agnostic to make that plea with anything more than a hope of covering all possibilities. Don't reveal it, Bell. If you know what I will do, you know it must be seen in its own time.\nBellonda brought Odrade out of reverie with a cough. “Are we going to eat or talk? People are staring.”\n“Should we have another go at Scytale?” Sheeana asked.\nWas that an attempt to divert my attention?\nBellonda said: “Give him nothing! He’s in reserve. Let him sweat.”\nOdrade looked carefully at Bellonda. She was fuming over the silence imposed on her by Odrade’s secret decision. Avoiding a meeting of eyes with Sheeana. Jealous! Bell is jealous of Sheeana!\nTamalane said, “I am only an advisor now but—”\n“Stop that, Tam!” Odrade snapped.\n“Tam and I have been discussing that ghola,” Bellonda said. (Idaho was “that ghola” when Bellonda had something disparaging to say.) “Why did he think he needed to talk secretly to Sheeana?” A hard stare at Sheeana.\nOdrade saw shared suspicion. She does not accept the explanation. Does she reject Duncan’s emotional bias?\nSheeana spoke quickly. “Mother Superior explained that!”\n“Emotion,” Bellonda sneered.\nOdrade raised her voice and was surprised at this reaction. “Suppressing emotions is a weakness!”\nTamalane’s shaggy eyebrows lifted.\nSheeana intruded: “If we won’t bend, we can break.”\nBefore Bellonda could respond, Odrade said: “Ice can be chipped apart or melted. Ice maidens are vulnerable to a single form of attack.”\n“I’m hungry,” Sheeana said.\nPeace-making? Not a role expected of The Mouse.\nTamalane stood. “Bouillabaisse. We must eat the fish before our sea is gone. Not enough nullentropy storage.”\nIn the softest of simulflows, Odrade noted the departure of her companions to the cafeteria line. Tamalane’s accusatory words recalled that second day with Sheeana after the decision to phase out the Great Sea. Standing at Sheeana’s window in the early morning, Odrade had watched a seabird move against the desert background. It winged its way northward, a creature completely out of place in that setting but beautiful in a profoundly nostalgic way because of it.\nWhite wings glistened in early sunlight. A touch of black beneath and in front of its eyes. Abruptly, it hovered, wings motionless. Then, lifting on an air current, it tucked its wings like a hawk and plummeted out of view behind the farther buildings. Reappearing, it carried something in its beak, a morsel it swallowed on the wing.\nA seabird alone and adapting.\nWe adapt. We do indeed adapt.\nIt was not a quiet thought. Nothing to induce repose. Shocking rather. Odrade had felt jarred out of a dangerously drifting course. Not only her beloved Chapterhouse but their entire human universe was breaking out of its old shapes and taking on new forms. Perhaps it was right in this new universe that Sheeana continued to conceal things from Mother Superior. And she is concealing something.\nOnce more, Bellonda’s acidic tones brought Odrade to full awareness of her surroundings. “If you won’t serve yourself, | suppose we must take care of you.” Bellonda placed a bowl of aromatic fish stew in front of Odrade, a great chunk of garlic bread beside it.\nWhen each had sampled the bouillabaisse, Bellonda put down her spoon and stared hard at Odrade. “You’re not going to suggest we ‘love one another’ or some such debilitating nonsense?”\n“Thank you for bringing my food,” Odrade said.\nSheeana swallowed and a wide grin came over her features. “It’s delicious.”\nBellonda returned to eating. “It’s all right.” But she had heard the unspoken comment.\nTamalane ate steadily, shifting attention from Sheeana to Bellonda and then to Odrade. Tam appeared to agree with a proposed softening of emotional strictures. At least, she voiced no objections and older Sisters were most likely to object.\nThe love the Bene Gesserit tried to deny was everywhere, Odrade thought. In small things and big. How many ways there were to prepare delectable, life-sustaining foods, recipes that really were embodiments of loves old and new. This bouillabaisse so smoothly restorative on her tongue; its origins were planted deeply in love: the wife at home using that part of the day’s catch her husband could not sell.\nThe very essence of the Bene Gesserit was concealed in loves. Why else minister to those unspoken needs humanity always carried? Why else work for the perfectibility of humankind?\nBowl empty, Bellonda put down her spoon and wiped up the dregs with the last of her bread. She swallowed, looking pensive. “Love weakens us,” she said. No force in her voice.\nAn acolyte could have said it no differently. Right out of the Coda. Odrade concealed amusement and countered with another Coda stepping-stone. “Beware jargon. It usually hides ignorance and carries little knowledge.”\nRespectful wariness entered Bellonda’s eyes.\nSheeana pushed herself back from the table and wiped her mouth with her napkin. Tamalane did the same. Her\nchairdog adjusted as she leaned back, eyes bright and amused.\nTam knows! The wily old witch is still wise in my ways. But Sheeana ... what game is Sheeana playing? | would almost say she hopes to distract me, to keep my attention away from her. She is very good at it, learned it at my knee. Well... two can play that game. I press Bellonda, but watch my little Dune waif.\n“What price respectability, Bell?” Odrade asked.\nBellonda accepted this thrust in silence. Hidden in Bene Gesserit jargon was a definition of respectability and they all knew it.\n“Should we honor the memory of the Lady Jessica for her humanity?” Odrade asked. Sheeana is surprised!\n“Jessica put the Sisterhood in jeopardy!” Bellonda ACCUSES.\n“To thine own Sisters be true,” Tamalane murmured.\n“Our antique definition of respectability helps keep us human,” Odrade said. Hear me well, Sheeana.\nHer voice little more than a whisper, Sheeana said, “If we lose that we lose it all.”\nOdrade suppressed a sigh. So that’s it!\nSheeana met her gaze. “You are instructing us, of course.”\n“Twilight thoughts,” Bellonda muttered. “Best we avoid them.”\n“Taraza called us ‘Latter-day Bene Gesserit,’” Sheeana said.\nOdrade’s mood went self-accusatory.\nThe bane of our present existence. Sinister imaginings can destroy us.\nHow easy it was to conjure a future that looked at them from glazing orange eyes of berserk Honored Matres. Fears out of many pasts crouched within Odrade, breathless moments focused on fangs that went with such eyes.\nOdrade forced her attention back to the immediate problem. “Who will accompany me to Junction?”\nThey knew Dortujla’s harrowing experience and word of it had spread throughout Chapterhouse.\n“Whoever goes with Mother Superior could well be fed to Futars.”\n“Tam,” Odrade said. “You and Dortujla.” And that may be a death sentence. The next step is obvious. “Sheeana,” Odrade said, “you will Share with Tam. Dortujla and | will Share with Bell. And | also will share with you before | go.”\nBellonda was a"], "parameters": {"model": "embedding-3"}}, "key": "embeddings_798424cdc7ce870000bd27c4f2c153d2db852ed9dc0e71ba5f9623a4eaf42145_v2"}
