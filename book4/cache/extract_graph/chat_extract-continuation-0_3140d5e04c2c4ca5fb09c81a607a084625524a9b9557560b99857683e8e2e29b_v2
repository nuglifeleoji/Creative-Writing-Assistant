苗凯也不说话，结果这几年把我冯世宽折腾得好苦哇！好，你苗主任今天也“领教”了这位被地区呼主任吹捧为“有能力、有魄力”的人物——这就是他的能力和魄力！ \n　　冯世宽今天太高兴了。从另一方面说，田福军否定他的意见也否定得好，这实际上是否定了苗主任的意见，只不过这意见由他嘴里说出来罢了。这种弄虚作假的事他冯世宽也不愿意做——将来万一被揭露了，吃亏的还不是他吗？到时苗主任还是苗主任，他会板下面孔义正词严地训斥他冯世宽丧失了党性原则！ \n　　吃过午饭以后，苗主任就坐车返回黄原地区了。冯世宽又把马国雄找来，让他很快把其它方面的工作抓紧进行——后天高老就要回原西县来了……第二天一大早，原西城就变成了一个乱纷纷的世界。所有的机关和学校，所有的干部、学生、工人、市民，都根据S*锓第六十九号文件精神，开展爱国卫生运动。到处都在大扫除，擦门窗，拔杂草，油漆牌匾、城市上空黄尘大罩，就象进行一场战争。县革委会副主任马国雄穿一身旧军装，戴一副墨镜，如同一位战时的城防司令，到处奔跑着检查和指挥。身材魁梧的马主任爱领导这些热闹工作，他红光满面，风尘仆仆，指手划脚，不时发出一些庄严的指示和命令。全城人忙了大半天，原西县城倒也顿时换了另一个面貌。 \n　　现在，从入城开始到十字街的一段路面，都修补得平平整整；两边还象黄原城一样筑起了人行道——不过刚刚能走一个人。所有道路两边的青草都被铲除的一干二净；本来这青草倒不失为一种风景。在县招待所的院子里，用白灰划出了一些方格子，准备到时按秩序停放汽车。最为瞩目的是，在那个小小的十字街中央，用石头块垒超了一个交通指挥台。那上面已经站了本城唯一的一名交通警察。因为没什么汽车，这位警察就指挥进城的手扶拖拉机和驴拉车。他手里也没有指挥棒，见有驴拉车过来，两条胳膊便象路标一般指示方向；慌得农民手忙脚乱地喝住牲畜，不知道这是什么意思？他们以为自己犯了法规，竟然惶恐地站在原地不动了。这位警察就气急败坏跳下指挥台，亲自扯着驴缰绳，把架子车拉过十字街。这恐怕又是个“新生事物”吧？原西城的一些闲人都好奇地聚在十字街周围，兴致勃勃地观看这热闹……这天上午十一点左右，一摆溜卧车和吉普车进了原西县招待所的院子。高老在苗凯和地区其它两位领导的陪同下，终于回到原西县来了。早\n######################\nOutput:",
