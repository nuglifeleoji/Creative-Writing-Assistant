当下闻孙策兵至，急聚众将商议。部将张英曰：“某领一军屯于牛渚，纵有百万之兵，亦不能近。”言未毕，帐下一人高叫曰：“某愿为前部先锋！”众视之，乃东莱黄县人太史慈也。慈自解了北海之围后，便来见刘繇，繇留于帐下。当日听得孙策来到，愿为前部先锋。繇曰：“你年尚轻，未可为大将，只在吾左右听命。”太史慈不喜而退。张英领兵至牛渚，积粮十万于邸阁。孙策引兵到，张英出迎，两军会于牛渚滩上。孙策出马，张英大骂，黄盖便出与张英战。不数合，忽然张英军中大乱，报说寨中有人放火。张英急回军。孙策引军前来，乘势掩杀。张英弃了牛渚，望深山而逃。原来那寨后放火的，只是两员健将：一人乃九江寿春人，姓蒋，名钦，字公奕；一人乃九江下蔡人，姓周，名泰，字幼平。二人皆遭世乱，聚人在洋子江中，劫掠为生；久闻孙策为江东豪杰，能招贤纳士，故特引其党三百余人，前来相投。策大喜，用为军前校尉。收得牛渚邸阁粮食、军器，并降卒四千余人，遂进兵神亭。却说张英败回见刘繇，繇怒欲斩之。谋士笮融、薛礼劝免，使屯兵零陵城拒敌。繇自领兵于神亭岭南下营，孙策于岭北下营。策问土人曰：“近山有汉光武庙否？”土人曰：“有庙在岭上。”策曰：“吾夜梦光武召我相见，当往祈之。”长史张昭曰：“不可。岭南乃刘繇寨，倘有伏兵，奈何？”策曰：“神人佑我，吾何惧焉！”遂披挂绰枪上马，引程普、黄盖、韩当、蒋钦、周泰等共十三骑，出寨上岭，到庙焚香。下马参拜已毕，策向前跪祝曰：“若孙策能于江东立业，复兴故父之基，即当重修庙宇，四时祭祀。”祝毕，出庙上马，回顾众将曰：“吾欲过岭，探看刘繇寨栅。”诸将皆以为不可。策不从，遂同上岭，南望村林。早有伏路小军飞报刘繇，繇曰：“此必是孙策诱敌之计，不可追之。”太史慈踊跃曰：“此时不捉孙策，更待何时！”遂不候刘繇将令，竟自披挂上马，绰枪出营，大叫曰：“有胆气者，都跟我来！”诸将不动。惟有一小将曰：“太史慈真猛将也！吾可助之！”拍马同行。众将皆笑。\n\n
