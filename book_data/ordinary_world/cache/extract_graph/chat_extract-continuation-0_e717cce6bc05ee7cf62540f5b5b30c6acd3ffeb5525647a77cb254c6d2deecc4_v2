\n　　全市上下总动员，抓环境卫生，抓服务质量，四处张贴着总指挥部内容详尽的公告。 \n　　先从“三点十线”开始！“三点”即市中心、飞机场及火车站；“十线”即全市十条主要大街。于是，到处都在清洗路面，建筑花坛，改换刷新门面；市委和市政府的领导跑着检查督战。自行车保管站一律压到人行道三米以外的背巷里；违章建筑、违章摊点，一律拆除；车辆行人，各走其道；临街门面，全部刷新；设立监督岗，严禁随地吐痰，乱扔果皮纸屑。田福军本人象巡视阵前的统帅，沿街每一段路，每一个店铺往过察看，一旦发现问题，即请来该段负责人，刀下见菜，马上罚款…… \n　　市民们根本不习惯这种“铁纪钢法” \n　　他们已经在中国式的随意性中生活惯了，因此立刻对文明所带来的“不自由”怨声载道。许多卖小吃的个体摊贩，都因卫生不合标准没能逃脱罚款的惩处；国营单位也不例外…… \n　　直到田福军学习当年黄原市白明川的做法，将省委大院也因卫生不合格罚了款，并且摘下了那块编号为零零一的“卫生先进”牌子后，抗议的声浪才渐渐平息下来。因为大家看见，这个人是真心想把城市往好搞。这个大浪潮随即从“三点十线”扩展到了全市。 \n　　一个月以后，城市骤然间就象重新换了面貌。严格的制度使这个面貌一直保持了下来。仅此一举，田福军便在这个城市声望鹊起。当然，也有人攻击他是靠罚款来搞工作的。是的，罚了。尽管他强调以教育为主，但该罚的也没有手软。其实，在大整顿过程中，共罚三百多起，现金总额不足万元。就这个近三百万人口的城市来说，多乎哉？不多也！ \n　　瞧吧，换来的又是什么？是一座崭新的城市！不仅清洁卫生，光去年秋天和今年春天，就在城市内外又新栽了二百多万株树和三十五万多平方米的草坪；十条主要大街的两侧都修了花坛，搞了雕塑；市民们的养花兴趣也随之高涨起来，大部分宿舍楼的阳台上都摆上了花盆……这阵儿，田福军还在清晨拥挤的人行道上踽踽而行。 \n　　尽管只有一年，他看起来一下子苍老了许多。头发大部分白了；身板瘦弱而单薄，肩背都有些佝偻。只有那双稍稍眯缝的眼睛仍不失当年的活色，那眼光挑剔着周围的一切，市民们挑剔地看这个城市的当家人，而他也挑剔地看这个城市一切不顺眼的地方。只有他挑剔得多些，别人才会少挑剔他。 \n　　唉，真是的，就因为这大城市的事繁琐，吃喝拉撒都要管，\n######################\nOutput:",
