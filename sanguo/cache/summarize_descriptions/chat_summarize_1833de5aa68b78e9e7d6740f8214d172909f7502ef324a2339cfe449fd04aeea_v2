He is primarily recognized as a general of the Shu Han, where he served as the Right General (右将军). In this capacity, 高翔 was responsible for commanding the innovative wooden oxen and flowing horses (木牛流马) used for transporting supplies, showcasing his logistical capabilities.\n\nThroughout his military career, 高翔 demonstrated strong leadership and strategic acumen. He participated in ambushes against enemy forces, notably assisting in the ambush against Ma Zun's troops. His involvement in these operations highlighted his commitment to the defense of Shu Han and his ability to coordinate effectively with other military leaders, such as Wei Yan. During one of the conflicts, he fought alongside Wei Yan and was also rescued, indicating his active engagement in battle and the camaraderie among the Shu Han forces.\n\nAdditionally, 高翔 was involved in counter-offensive plans against the Wei army, further emphasizing his role in the military strategies of Shu Han. His leadership was instrumental in executing these plans, which aimed to repel Wei forces and protect Shu territories.\n\nHowever, there is a contradiction in the descriptions regarding his allegiance, as one source states that 高翔 is a general of Wei, while the majority of the descriptions affirm his position within Shu Han. To resolve this, it is clear that 高翔 is primarily associated with Shu Han, where he served as a general and played a crucial role in their military efforts against Wei.\n\nIn summary, 高翔 is a prominent military officer of Shu Han, recognized for his leadership in logistics and combat. He played a vital role in ambushes, counter-offensive strategies, and the transportation of supplies, demonstrating his multifaceted contributions to the military campaigns of his time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1754984155, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_efad92c60b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 636, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"detected": false, "filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
