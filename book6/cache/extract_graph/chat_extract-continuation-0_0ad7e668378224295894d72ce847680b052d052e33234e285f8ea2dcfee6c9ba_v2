他们谈了很多，什么都谈，在最琐碎的话题上他们都有共同语言，直到罗辑把那一瓶“晚霞的眼睛”都喝进肚子为止。\n　　罗辑晕乎平地躺在床上，看着茶几上即将燃尽的蜡烛，烛光中的她已经消失了。但罗辑并不担心，只要他愿意，她随时都会出现。\n　　这时响起了敲门声，罗辑知道这是现实中的敲门声，与她无关，就没有理会。\n　　门被推开了，进来的是白蓉。她打开了电灯，像打开了灰色的现实。看了看燃着蜡烛的茶几，然后在罗辑的床头坐下，轻轻叹息了一声说：“还好。”\n　　“好什么？”罗辑用手挡着刺目的电灯光。\n　　“你还没有投入到为她也准备一只酒杯的程度。”\n　　罗辑捂着眼睛没有说话，白蓉拿开了他的手，注视着他问：“她活了，是吗？”\n　　罗辑点点头，翻身坐了起来：“蓉，我以前总是以为，小说中的人物是受作者控制的，作者让她是什么样儿她就是什么样儿，作者让地干什么她就干什么，就像上帝对我们一样。”\n　　“错了！”白蓉也站了起来，在屋子里来回走着。“现在你知道错了，这就是一个普通写手和一个文学家的区别。文学形象的塑造过程有一个最高状态，在那种状态下，小说中的人物在文学家的思想中拥有了生命，文学家无法控制这些人物，甚至无法预测他们下一步的行为，只是好奇地跟着他们，像偷窥狂一般观察他们生活中最细微的部分，记录下来，就成为了经典。”\n　　“原来文学创作是一件变态的事儿。”\n　　“至少从莎士比亚到巴尔扎克到托尔斯泰都是这样，他们创造的那些经典形象都是这么着从他们思想的子宫中生出来的。但现在的这些文学人已经失去了这种创造力，他们思想中所产生的都是一些支离破碎的残片和怪胎，其短暂的生命表现为无理性的晦涩的痉挛，他们把这些碎片扫起来装到袋子里，贴上后现代啦解构主义啦象征主义啦非理性啦这类标签卖出去。”\n　　“你的意思是我已经成了经典的文学家？”\n　　“那倒不是，你的思想只孕育了一个形象，而且是最容易的一个；而那些经典文学家，他们在思想中能催生成百上千个这样的形象，形成一幅时代的画卷，这可是超人才能做到的事。不过你能做到这点也不容易，我本来以为你做不到的。”\n　　“你做到过吗？”\n　　“也是只有一次。”白蓉简单地回答，然后迅速转移话锋，接住罗辑的脖子说，“算了，我不要那生目礼物了，你也回到正常的生活中来，好吗？”\n　　“如果这一切继续下去会怎么样？”\n　　白蓉盯着罗辑研究了几秒钟，然后放开了他，笑着摇摇头：“我知道晚了。”\n######################\nOutput:",
