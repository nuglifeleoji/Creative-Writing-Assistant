They serve as advisors, strategists, and analysts, leveraging their enhanced cognitive abilities to process complex data and devise optimal solutions. Their mental operations function similarly to advanced computers, requiring significant caloric intake due to the high energy demands of their specialized brain functions.  \n\nNotable Mentats include **Piter de Vries**, who serves the Harkonnens, demonstrating their role as loyal and calculating aides to powerful factions. Other prominent figures, such as **Idaho**, **Bellonda**, and **Teg**, further exemplify the diverse applications of Mentat abilities, whether in military strategy, governance, or covert operations.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing their advisory roles, others highlighting their physiological demands—the core definition remains consistent: Mentats are elite human minds engineered for precision, logic, and strategic mastery.
