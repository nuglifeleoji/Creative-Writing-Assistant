It grants temporary citizenship and oversees the citizenship process for individuals, ensuring that legal statuses are maintained and laws are enforced. This organization is not only a political entity but also a significant player in the realm of soul cultivation and the management of soul beasts.\n\nHistorically, the 联邦 has been instrumental in the battle against the Abyss Plane, developing methods to enhance soul rings, which are vital for soul masters. It encompasses a diverse array of powerful individuals and institutions, fostering a community that supports the growth and development of talented soul masters, especially those with innate full soul power. The Federation provides scholarships and resources to nurture these individuals, thereby promoting the advancement of soul cultivation.\n\nIn addition to its supportive role, the 联邦 poses a considerable threat to criminal organizations if provoked, indicating its strong enforcement capabilities and commitment to maintaining order. It also manages agreements related to soul beasts, overseeing the discovery and resource exchange involving these ancient creatures. The organization has documented extensive information about ancient soul beasts and their characteristics, which is crucial for both research and practical applications in soul cultivation.\n\nThe 联邦 is characterized as a peaceful organization dedicated to interstellar exploration and the protection of its members' safety.
