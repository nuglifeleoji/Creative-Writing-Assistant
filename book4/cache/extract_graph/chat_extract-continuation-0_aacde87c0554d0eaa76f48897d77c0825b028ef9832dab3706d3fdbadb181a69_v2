第7章\n　　孙少安回家后，天还没有黑。家里人已经吃完了晚饭——给他留下的饭在锅里热着。父亲碗一放就到院子的旱烟地忙去了。秀莲正给虎子洗脸——她等他吃完饭，就准备一块相跟着回田家圪崂的饲养院。 \n　　少安把衣袋里的水果糖给儿子掏在炕上，然后抱歉地对家里的其他大人笑笑，说：“我有些事，回来得忙，没顾上给你们买个什么……” \n　　大人们都没言传，甚至也没认真听他说这话——他们压根儿就不会想赶一回集还要买个什么。 \n　　少安接着匆忙地扒拉了两碗饭，对妻子说：“你先回去，我和爸爸有个事要商量一下。过会就回来了。” \n　　秀莲把虎子亲了亲，就起身走了。虎子一直是跟爷爷奶奶在这面睡的。 \n　　少安放下碗把嘴一抹，走到院子里，对忙活的父亲说：“爸，我有个事想和你拉谈一下……” \n　　孙玉厚老汉拍打着一双沾泥带土的手，从旱烟地里转出来，和儿子面对面蹲在院子的空场地上。 \n　　少安卷好一支旱烟卷，等父亲把烟锅装起后，一根火柴点着了两个人的烟。 \n　　接着，他就把公社刘根民给他说的事，一五一十给父亲转述了一遍。 \n　　孙玉厚听儿子说完，迷瞪了半天；然后不由自主地用手指头在地上划开了道道——这是进行计算活动。他划的不是数字，而是一些象古星像图似的点点杠杠；除了他，谁也看不懂其中的奥妙。平时简单的帐玉厚老汉都用心算；一遇较复杂的数字，他就手指头在地上划开了这种“星像图”。孙玉厚在地上划了一会，抬起头，说：“除去了沓杂，一天能赚不少钱。” \n　　这笔帐孙少安早就算过了，他说：“就是的。”“可是牲口买不起啊！”孙玉厚看着儿子说。“这活苦重，驴不行，得用个骡子；可这得千儿八百才能买来！咱们借百二八十手都抖得哩。这么多钱怎敢借？要是公家都贷了款还好说。可人家只给七百块，剩下的就要向私人错。私人谁有那么多钱？就是别人有，咱能借来吗？总不能再向金俊海家开口吧？你结婚时借下的钱，要不是少平教书有两个补贴，恐怕现在都还不了人家……话又说回来，就是公家的贷款，也是限时间还，而且要扛利息……” \n　　“不管怎样，只要能买了牲畜，干一两个月活，这些帐债开过，还能赚不少钱呢！”少安看出父亲借债借怕了，把他刚算过的那笔有利的帐忘记了。 \n　　孙玉厚才又反应过来，这次借债和少安结婚借�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
