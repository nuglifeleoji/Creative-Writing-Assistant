   曹操入城，即传令退了所决之水，出榜安民；一面与玄德同坐白门楼上。关、张侍立于侧，提过擒获一干人来。吕布虽然长大，却被绳索捆作一团，布叫曰：“缚太急，乞缓之！”操曰：“缚虎不得不急。”布见侯成、魏续、宋宪皆立于侧，乃谓之曰：“我待诸将不薄，汝等何忍背反？”宪曰：“听妻妾言，不听将计，何谓不薄？”布默然。须臾，众拥高顺至。操问曰：“汝有何言？”顺不答。操怒命斩之。徐晃解陈宫至。操曰：“公台别来无恙！”宫曰：“汝心术不正，吾故弃汝！”操曰：“吾心不正，公又奈何独事吕布？”宫曰：“布虽无谋，不似你诡诈奸险。”操曰：“公自谓足智多谋，今竟何如？”宫顾吕布曰：“恨此人不从吾言！若从吾言，未必被擒也。”操曰：“今日之事当如何？”宫大声曰：“今日有死而已！”操曰：“公如是，奈公之老母妻子何？”宫曰：“吾闻以孝治天下者，不害人之亲；施仁政于天下者，不绝人之祀。老母妻子之存亡，亦在于明公耳。吾身既被擒，请即就戮，并无挂念。”操有留恋之意。宫径步下楼，左右牵之不住。操起身泣而送之。宫并不回顾。操谓从者曰：“即送公台老母妻子回许都养老。怠慢者斩。”宫闻言，亦不开口，伸颈就刑。众皆下泪。操以棺椁盛其尸，葬于许都。后人有诗叹之曰：“生死无二志，丈夫何壮哉！不从金石论，空负栋梁材。辅主真堪\n######################\nOutput:",
