“这、这是二环的实力？”钱磊和刘锋都有些目瞪口呆。\n\n    少女道：“快说，这是怎么回事啊？”\n------------\n\n第九十一章 金龙升天\n\n    蓝轩宇道：“我同学的武魂能力是召唤，他开启了召唤之门后，我碰触到召唤之门就感觉到好像有一种联系出现，然后你就被召唤过来了。你也是联邦人吗？也在天罗星？”\n\n    少女惊讶的看着他道：“天罗星？这里是天罗星？可是，我是在天斗星的啊！”\n\n    “这……”\n\n    蓝轩宇看向钱磊，这都什么情况，他们竟然横跨星际，从天斗星召唤来一个同龄少女？\n\n    钱磊眨了眨眼睛，然后突然挺起胸膛，“空间的奥秘，你们不懂。”\n\n    刘锋不屑的道：“你懂？”\n\n    钱磊哼了一声，“反正我完成跨星球召唤了。”\n\n    “那这三只大狗你们自己对付吧。”少女没好气的说了一句，扭头就钻回召唤之门去了，光芒一闪，消失不见。\n\n    召唤之门也随之闭合。\n\n    刘锋哈哈一笑，“还是不靠谱啊！就冲你这嘴，也不靠谱。”\n\n    “你还笑？快对敌。一个斗罗币啊！”钱磊怪叫一声，已经闪身到蓝轩宇背后，毫无疑问，在他心目中，蓝轩宇显然是要靠谱得多的。\n\n    三头百年熔岩犬的火球已经释放，而此时蓝轩宇心中却有些乱。\n\n    自己碰触到召唤之门，召唤之门就出现了变化，而自己的银纹蓝银草缠绕在那少女身上，她的战斗力似乎也明显有所提升。这是为什么呢？难道说，自己的武魂其实是辅助类的？可以让其他人的战斗力变得更强？可当初自己在面对叶灵瞳的时候，为什么每次叶灵瞳的武魂都会失效？这究竟是怎么回事啊？\n\n    众多疑惑存心，让他有些茫然，对自己的武魂已经不知道是什么情况了。\n\n    刘锋此时已经冲了出去，凭借着超快的速度，他从侧面绕向三头百年熔岩犬。而那三枚火球却是直奔蓝轩宇方向而来。\n\n    蓝轩宇不敢再多想，一拉身后钱磊，迅速朝着旁边扑去。有钱磊在身边，他的步法优势根本发挥不出来。一面冰墙阻挡，这才让他们趁机冲出了火球覆盖。\n\n    刘锋此时已经冲到熔岩犬旁边，白龙枪挑飞一头熔岩犬，但他也就是能做到这一点了，但似乎他的实战经验受到刺激有所增强，在另外两头熔岩犬扑上来之前已经闪身避开，冲向另一边。\n\n    这也给蓝轩宇\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
