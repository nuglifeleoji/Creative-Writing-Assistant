And in time, a way would be found to nullify a no-ship’s invisibility. Taraza did not think the people of the Scattering had found this—at least not the ones skulking back into the places that had Spawned them.\nThere was absolutely no safe course through the conflicting forces, but she thought the Sisterhood had armed itself as well as it could. The problem was akin to that of a\nGuild navigator threading his ship through the folds of space in a way that avoided collisions and entrapments.\nEntrapments, they were the key, and there was Odrade springing the Sisterhood’s traps on the Tleilaxu.\nWhen Taraza thought about Odrade, which was often in these crisis times, their long association reasserted itself. It was as though she looked at a faded tapestry in which some figures remained bright. Brightest of all, assuring Odrade’s position close to the seats of Sisterhood command, was her Capacity for cutting across details and getting at the Surprising meat of a conflict. It was a form of that dangerous Atreides prescience working secretly within her. Using this hidden talent was the one thing that had aroused the most opposition, and it was the one argument that Taraza admitted had the most validity. That thing working far below the surface, its hidden movements indicated only by occasional turbulence, that was the problem!\n“Use her but stand ready to eliminate her,” Taraza had argued. “We will still have most of her offspring.”\nTaraza knew she could depend on Lucilla... provided Lucilla had found sanctuary somewhere with Teg and the ghola. Alternate assassins existed at the Keep on Rakis, of course. That weapon might have to be armed soon.\nTaraza experienced a sudden turmoil within herself. Other Memories advised caution in the utmost. Never again lose control of the breeding lines! Yes, if Odrade escaped an elimination attempt, she would be alienated forever. Odrade was a full Reverend Mother and some of those must still remain out there in the Scattering—not among the Honored Matres the Sisterhood had observed... but still...\nNever Again! That was the operational motto. Never another Kwisatz Haderach or another Tyrant.\nControl the breeders: Control their offspring.\nReverend Mothers did not die when their flesh died. They sank farther and farther into the Bene Gesserit living core\nuntil their casual instructions and even their unconscious observations became a part of the continuing Sisterhood.\nMake no mistakes about Odrade!\nThe response to Odrade required specific tailoring and exquisite care. Odrade, who allowed certain limited affections, “a mild warmth,” she called them, argued that emotions provided valuable insights if you did not let them govern you. Taraza saw this mild warmth as a way into the heart of Odrade, a vulnerable opening.\n| know what you think of me, Dar, with your mild warmth toward an old companion from school days. You think l am a potential danger to the Sisterhood but that I can be saved from myself by watchful “friends.”\nTaraza knew that some of her advisors shared Odrade’s opinion, listened quietly and reserved judgment. Most of them still followed the Mother Superior’s lead but many knew of Odrade’s wild talent and had recognized Odrade’s doubts. Only one thing kept most of the Sisters in line and Taraza did not try to delude herself about it.\nEvery Mother Superior acted out of a profound loyalty to her Sisterhood. Nothing must endanger Bene Gesserit continuity, not even herself. In her precise and harshly self- judgmental way, Taraza examined her relationship to the Sisterhood’s continuing life.\nObviously, there was no immediate necessity to eliminate Odrade. Yet, Odrade was now so close to the center of the ghola design that little occurring there could escape her sensitive observation. Much that had not been revealed to her would become known. The Atreides Manifesto had been almost a gamble. Odrade, the obvious person to produce the Manifesto, could only achieve a deeper insight as she wrote the document, but the words themselves were the ultimate barrier to revelation.\nWaff would appreciate that, Taraza knew.\nTurning from the dark window, Taraza went back to her chairdog. The moment of crucial decision—go or no-go—\ncould be delayed but intermediate steps must be taken. She composed a sample message in her mind and examined it while sending a summons to Burzmali. The Bashar’s favorite student would have to be sent into action but not as Odrade wanted.\nThe message to Odrade was essentially simple:\n“Help is on the way. You are on the scene, Dar. Where safety of girl Sheeana is concerned, use own judgment. In all other matters that do not conflict with my orders, carry out the plan.”\nThere. That was it. Odrade had her instructions, the essentials that she would accept as “the plan” even while she would recognize an incomplete pattern. Odrade would obey. The “Dar” was a nice touch, Taraza thought. Dar and Tar. That opening into Odrade’s mild warmth would not be well shielded from the Dar-and-Tar direction.\nThe long table on the right is set for a banquet of roast desert hare in sauce cepeda. The other dishes, clockwise to the right from the far end of the table, are aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (note the hawk crest of the Atreides on the urn), pot-a-oie and, in the Balut crystal bottle, sparkling Caladan wine. Note the ancient poison detector concealed in the chandelier.\n—DAR-ES-BALAT, DESCRIPTION AT A MUSEUM DISPLAY\nTe found Duncan in the tiny dining alcove off the no- globe’s gleaming kitchen. Pausing in the passage to the alcove, Teg studied Duncan carefully: eight days here and the lad appeared finally to have recovered from the peculiar rage that had seized him as they entered the globe’s access tube.\nThey had come through a shallow cave musky with the odors of a native bear. The rocks at the back of the lair were not rocks, although they would have deceived even the most sophisticated examination. A slight protrusion in the rocks would shift if you knew or stumbled upon the secret code. That circular and twisting movement opened the entire rear wall of the cave.\nThe access tube, brilliantly lighted automatically once they sealed the portal behind them, was decorated with Harkonnen griffins on walls and ceiling. Teg was struck by the image of a young Patrin stumbling into this place for the first time (The shock! The awe! The elation!) and he failed to observe Duncan’s reaction until a low growl swelled in the enclosed space.\nDuncan stood growling (almost a moan), fists clenched, gaze fixed on a Harkonnen griffin along the right-hand wall. Rage and confusion warred for supremacy on his face. He\nlifted both fists and crashed them against the raised figure, drawing blood from his hands.\n“Damn them to the deepest pits of hell!” he shouted.\nIt was an oddly mature curse issuing from the youthful mouth.\nThe instant the words were out Duncan relapsed into uncontrolled shudders. Lucilla put an arm around him and stroked his neck in a soothing, almost sensual way, until the shuddering subsided.\n“Why did I do that?” Duncan whispered.\n“You will Know when your original memories are restored,” she said.\n“Harkonnens,” Duncan whispered and blood suffused his face. He looked up at Lucilla. “Why do | hate them so much?”\n“Words cannot explain it,” she said. “You will have to wait for the memories.”\n“I don’t want the memories!” Duncan shot a startled look at Teg. “Yes! Yes, | do want them.”\nLater as he looked up at Teg in the no-globe’s dining alcove, Duncan’s memory obviously returned to that moment.\n“When, Bashar?”\n“Soon.”\nTeg glanced around the area. Duncan sat alone at the auto-scrubbed table, a cup of brown liquid in front of him. Teg recognized the smell: one of the many melange-laced items from the nullentropy bins. The bins were a treasure house of exotic foods, clothing, weapons, and other artifacts —a museum whose value could not be calculated. There was a thin layer of dust all through the globe but no deterioration of the things stored here. Every bit of the food was laced with melange, not at an addict level unless you were a glutton, but always noticeable. Even the preserved fruit had been dusted with the spice.\nThe brown liquid in Duncan’s cup was one of the things Lucilla had tasted and pronounced capable of sustaining life. Teg did not know precisely how Reverend Mothers did this, but his own mother had been capable of it. One taste and they knew the contents of food or drink.\nA glance at the ornate clock set into the wall at the closed end of the alcove told Teg it was later than he thought, well into the third hour of their arbitrary afternoon. Duncan Should still be up on the elaborate practice floor but they both had seen Lucilla take off into the globe’s upper reaches and Teg saw this as a chance for them to talk unobserved.\nPulling up a chair, Teg seated himself on the opposite side of the table.\nDuncan said, “I hate those clocks!”\n“You hate everything here,” Teg said, but he took a second look at the clock. It was another antique, a round face with two analog hands and a digital second counter. The two hands were priapean—naked human figures: a large male with enormous phallus and a smaller female with legs spread wide. Each time the two clock hands met, the male appeared to enter the female.\n“Gross,” Teg agreed. He pointed to Duncan’s drink: “You like that?”\n“It’s all right, sir. Lucilla says | should have it after exercise.”\n“My mother used to make me a similar drink for after heavy exertions,” Teg said. He leaned forward and inhaled, remembering the aftertaste, the cloying melange in his nostrils.\n“Sir, how long must we stay here?” Duncan asked.\n“Until we are found by the right people or until we’re sure we will not be found.”\n“But... cut off in here, how will we know?”\n“When I judge it’s time, l'Il take the life-shield blanket and start keeping watch outside.”\n“I hate this place!”\n“Obviously. But have you learned nothing about patience?”\nDuncan grimaced. “Sir, why are you keeping me from being alone with Lucilla?”\nTeg, exhaling as Duncan spoke, locked on the partial exhalation and then resumed breathing. He knew, though, that the lad had observed. If Duncan knew, then Lucilla must know!\n“| don’t think Lucilla knows what you’re doing, sir,” Duncan said, “but it’s getting pretty obvious.” He glanced around him. “If this place didn’t take so much of her attention . .. Where does she dash off to like that?”\n“I think she’s up in the library.”\n“Library!”\n“I agree it’s primitive but it’s also fascinating.” Teg lifted his gaze to the scrollwork on the nearby kitchen ceiling. The moment of decision had arrived. Lucilla could not be depended upon to remain distracted much longer. Teg Shared her fascination, though. It was easy to lose yourself in these marvels.
