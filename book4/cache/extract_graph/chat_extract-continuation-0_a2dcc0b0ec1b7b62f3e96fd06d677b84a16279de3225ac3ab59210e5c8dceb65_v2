\n　　在乡县领导中我们熟悉的人有：县乡镇企业局局长徐治功——该同志双水村的老百姓也很熟悉；本乡乡长刘根民，副乡长杨高虎。其他还有县宣传部、教育局、人大政协文教组的负责人。本来县长周文龙也想来——我们知道，他曾专门为少安的砖场点过火——但因有会，没能起程。 \n　　金俊武、孙少安等人迎上去和上面的领导握手问候。紧接着，由秧歌队在前面引路，这些领导被热情的双水村迎过了东拉河，迎过了庙坪和哭咽河。小学门口的孩子们立刻挥动花束，一边跳跃，一边齐喊欢迎的口号，与秧歌队的锣鼓唢呐混合成一片巨大的喧响声。玉亭几乎把这场面搞成了迎接外国国家元首…… \n　　经过一番必然的纷乱，领导们终于在贺凤英精心布置的主席台上就坐了。俊武是会议主持人。不用说，男女主角孙少安和贺秀莲也在主席台上。 \n　　在庆祝会就要开始之前，主席台上的孙少安突然看见田福堂也来到了人群里。 \n　　田福堂是来了。他有勇气在最后一刻出现在这个场所，证明他不愧还是一条好汉！不过，福堂看起来不象过去那般气势雄伟。他在很大程度上成了一位平凡的农村老人，脸上甚至带着看开世事的超然和善的笑容。他不是一个人站在人群里。他手里拖着红梅前夫留下的孩子，背上背着润生和红梅生的女儿。他还给两个小孙子一人做了一个高粱杆皮编的“风葫芦”玩具。比起往常，福堂的身体看来倒好多了。 \n　　孙少安立刻离开座位，穿过人群，走到田福堂面前，拉他到主席台就坐。福堂谦虑而客气地推让着。懂事的红梅走过来，把两个孩子从公公手里接过去。孙少安硬把前支书拉到主席台上，并向县委书记作了介绍。受到启发的金俊武也在人群里把金俊山拉到了主席台上。双水村新旧两任领导历史性地同坐在一起。 \n　　接着，庆祝仪式开始了。乡县领导分别发表了热情洋溢的讲话，表彰孙少安夫妇劳动致富后不忘为乡亲们谋福的光荣行为。县教育局还给少安夫妇颁发了一块大玻璃框奖状。 \n　　在乡县领导人讲话的时候，孙少安几乎连一个字也没听见。他的目光在人群中搜寻到父亲。父亲头低倾着。少安猜测，老人家说不定在哭。他在学生娃中间也看见了儿子。红脸蛋的儿子举一束红艳的鲜花，在笑。哭，笑，都是因为欢乐。哭的人知道而笑的人\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
