He played a significant role in the tumultuous power struggles that characterized this period, particularly in opposition to the formidable rival Cao Cao. As a military leader, Yuan Xi sought to assert his influence and reclaim power following his father's decline.\n\nDuring his attempts to navigate the complex political landscape, Yuan Xi faced numerous challenges and ultimately sought refuge with Gongsun Kang, a regional power player. Despite his efforts, Yuan Xi's endeavors to consolidate power were largely unsuccessful, marking a series of failed attempts to establish his authority in the face of overwhelming opposition.
