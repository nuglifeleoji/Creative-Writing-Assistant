Initially tasked with overseeing Duncan's well-being, Geasa was later removed from this role after he gained knowledge about gholas. A failed Reverend Mother, Geasa also acted as one of Duncan's teachers, though her guidance was often limitedâ€”she provided only partial answers regarding his studies and origins. Despite her shortcomings, her dual roles as caretaker and instructor positioned her as a significant, if flawed, figure in Duncan's early development.  \n\nThis summary reconciles both descriptions, clarifying that Geasa's removal as caretaker did not negate her later role as an instructor, albeit one with restricted transparency. Her background as a failed Reverend Mother further contextualizes her limitations in guiding Duncan.
