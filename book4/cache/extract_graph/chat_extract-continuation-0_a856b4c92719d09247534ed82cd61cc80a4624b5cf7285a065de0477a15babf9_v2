\n　　金俊文的二小子是金家唯一的守法公民了。这个当年曾和他哥一样调皮捣蛋的青年，不知什么时候脑筋开了窍。在不知不觉中成了一个相当出色的青年。 \n　　双水村人是慢慢才把金强和他家其他人区别开来的。后来，几乎全村人都夸赞起了这个青年。小伙在土地上的那股勤劳劲头，很象他死去的三爸金俊斌。但他又比他三爸活泛，尊老爱小，见人不笑不说话。不论谁家有难处，只要他能帮上，就会尽力而为。更主要的是，他和人交往的时候，总谦让着叫自己吃点亏——这对于一个农民来说，是最受人尊敬的品质。事物就是这样奇怪——一条西葫芦蔓上却结出了一颗南瓜！ \n　　几年来，金强背着大哥和老人的贼名，异常痛苦地生活着。家里所有的农活也都撂给了他。有时候，当耳朵边传来别人对他家的无情讥笑时，他真想操起杀猪刀子，把父母和大哥都一起捅死！他忍受着耻辱和折磨，没明没黑泡在山里，眼泪直往肚子里流。没办法啊！他还鼓不起勇气跑到公安局去告发他的亲人，以便及早结束这黑暗的生活……现在，他脸上染着烟灰，坐在灶火圪崂里一手拉风箱，一手往炉灶里添柴。 \n　　此刻，他并不难受，反而觉得心里很轻快。当公安人员把铐子戴到父母和大哥的手上的时候，他感到自己精神上的镣铐就“哗啦”一声打开了，他的日子也许将更艰难，但他自己是清白的。做一个清白人多么好啊！他知道，双水村大部分人不会把他和家里的其他人混为一谈。 \n　　金强听见院子里传来脚步声。他抬起头，在烟熏火燎中看见进来的是卫红。他立刻感到浑身象抽了筋似的绵软……卫红是孙玉亭的大女儿。此刻，她怎么独个儿走进这个丧失了名誉的家庭呢？ \n　　其实，在此之前，世界上没有人知道，孙玉亭的这个大女儿，一两年前就和金强产生了很深的感情。 \n　　他们的恋爱是从大山里开始的。 \n　　责任制以后，碰巧孙玉亭的几块地都和金强家的地紧挨着，玉亭和凤英劳动实在差劲，好多情况下，都是他们的大女儿卫红一个人在地里干活。至于金强家，我们知道，其他人都在忙“生意”，山里的活也是金强一个人干。 \n　　两个青年常常在相邻的地里不期而遇。卫红终究是个女孩子，地里的活干起来相当吃力。有些活路她实际上根本干不了，急得坐在地上抹眼泪。这时候，金�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>金俊文<|>PERSON<|>金俊文 is a
