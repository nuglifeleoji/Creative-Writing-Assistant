�。这一切都是实实在在的，很难想象会是梦境。两个孩子又在车轮的催眠曲中渐渐睡着了，华华希望再梦见更多神奇的事，小梦则希望自己能在梦中见到爷爷。\n　　这时车箱中也安静下来，人们都开始重新睡觉。宁静的夜又回来了，似乎被打扰的世界想在黎明前抓紧时间再睡会儿。谁都没想到，这是人类最后一段无扰无虑的睡眠。外面的灯光多了起来，火车离北京不远了。\n　　\n　　三、世纪末恶梦\n　　\n　　两个孩子乘坐的列车在天刚亮的时候进入了北京站。孩子们走出车箱，周围来自全国各地的人们都在高声或低声地谈论着夜里发生的事，但那件事带来的影响也仅此而已，人群的情绪是平静的，没有惊慌和恐惧。\n　　孩子们在密密的人群中穿过地下走廊，发着柔和光芒的广告牌从他们的两侧和上方缓缓移过去。出站时，华华混在拥挤的大人们中间溜了出去，和小梦一起进入了共和国的首都。站前广场的西面，聚着黑压压一大群人，都在观看那面八十年代末立起的电子新闻显示板，显示板上出现以下的文字：\n　　“……国内各大天文台以及中国天文学会的专家们刚刚从观察结果确认，昨天夜间二十三点四十分至今天三点十三分出现的天象，系一颗超新星爆发。\n　　超新星爆发是宇宙间的大质量恒星演化到最后阶段时，通过内部的重元素核聚变，突然抛出巨量的恒星物质，并伴随着巨大能量爆发的天文现象。\n　　人类历史上有过多次超新星爆发的记载。我国记录超新星的历史最为悠久，早在公元前1300年，甲骨文上就记载了现称为心宿二的恒星附近出现的一颗明亮的恒星。公元185年有记载：‘十月癸亥，一客星出于南门，其大如斗笠，鲜艳缤纷，后渐衰萎，于次年六月没。’在以后的一千年，我国历史上又有过五次超新星的记载，其中有的还被其它文化所记录。最近的一次超新星爆发是在1987年2月23日夜晚，位于大麦哲伦星云方向，那颗超新星距我们大约170000光年。\n　　对于刚刚爆发的超新星，我们还未来得及收到各天文台完整的观察结果。\n　　已接受采访的各方面专家认为，这颗超新星是有史以来距离最近的一颗超新星爆发，据初步估计，它距太阳系的距离在20光年之内，从天文学的尺度来看，这可以说是近在眼前了。这颗超新星出现在御夫星座方向，肉眼可视时间为3小时6分钟。现在，世界各国的天文学家们正全力以赴地研究这颗超新星，我国紫金山天文台刚刚收到国际天文学会的电报，已将这颗超新星命名为1999A。相信对1999A的研究将大大加深人类对银河系乃至整个宇�\n######################\nOutput:",

的天文学家们正全力以赴地研究这颗超新星，我国紫金山天文台刚刚收到国际天文学会的电报，已将这颗超新星命名为1999A。相信对1999A的研究将大大加深人类对银河系乃至整个宇宙发展规律的认识。\n　　超新星1999A的出现曾使全球通讯中断了3个小时，现在各地的通讯已恢复，但来自太空的干扰仍很大；另外，据刚刚收到的外电报道，超新星曾在地球两极和高纬度地区产生了强烈的闪电，闪电在苏联北部地区、美国阿拉斯加以及挪威、瑞典等北欧国家造成了很大的破坏，受灾地区的详细情况有待报道。”\n　　对于两个孩子来说，超新星和北京，后者现在对他们更有吸引力，当他们漫步在宽阔的长安街上时，已差不多把1999A忘了。\n　　半小时后，他们站到天安门广场上了。清晨的广场宁静而清新，从空气浑浊的车厢中出来，又刚刚走出拥挤的北京站，孩子们仿佛来到一个宽阔的童话世界。广场四周那些共和国的中心建筑物，雄伟地静立在晨雾中，好像在等着他们到来。两个孩子们在广场上尽情地奔跑起来，把离家以后的恐惧和孤独忘得干干净净。他们跑过金水桥，呆呆地看着天安门的红墙，摸着大门上光滑的大铜包……\n　　太阳在长安街的东面升起来了，旗杆的顶端挂住了一抹金辉，天安门和草坪都沐浴在金光中，空气中充满了春天的气息，这时的世界是最美的，这时的时光是最美的。\n　　国旗升到了早晨的阳光中，士兵们在向她敬礼，旁边还有很多人在看着它，有大人，有小孩儿。\n　　随后，两个孩子前门售票处，小梦买了一张后天往延边去的车票。本来在火车站对面的站前售票处，她可以买到明天的票，但一想到前方那孤独的旅程她就头疼，她不想那么快就离开这个新朋友，而且用明天一天的时间，说不定能劝华华放弃他的冒险，和自己同行呢。\n　　至于华华，没有什么可令他担忧的事，挣钱和去西藏的事等小梦走后再计划，现在首先要在北京好好玩玩儿。北京比孩子们想象的大，他们在天安门一带漫无目的但心情愉快地转悠着。\n　　只有很少的人谈论超新星。在平时，人们都在大地上忙忙碌碌地生活着，似乎天空和宇宙已与他们毫无关系了。很少有人在夜间专心地看过星星，一次调查表明，这个国家中竟有一半以上的成年人不知道白天也会看到月亮。对于大气层之外的宇宙，人们有一种深深的麻木感。1987年9月的那次日环食使很多人隔着熏黑的玻璃片儿望了天空十几分钟，但并没有使多少人对大气层\n######################\nOutput:",

�星是在一秒钟内突然出现的，北半球的人们在五分钟内陆续从睡梦中醒来，紧接着经历了人类有史以来最大的恐慌，在前10分钟，几乎所有的人都失去了正常的判断和行动能力，整个世界呆住了。以下是留下来的几则目击记录：\n　　在日本群岛和北美大陆的太平洋沿岸看到的天象最为壮观：\n　　“3月2日23点，我乘坐北海道海岸警卫队的一艘巡逻艇去值勤。最近几天天刚亮，总有几只南朝鲜和菲律宾的渔船进入禁渔区偷渔，所以我们这次启程很早。艇上有北海道警视厅的三个人，还有通产省来的一个观察员。我们从知床岬起航，驶到根室海峡出口中部时，天已放亮。\n　　当时我正在底舱煮咖啡，突然听到甲板上的人在紧张地来回跑，我以为又发现了闯入禁渔区的渔船，正要出去，见岩田靖一慌慌张张地钻进舱来。就在他打开舱盖时，一片亮光从外面射进来，似乎有一盏探照灯对着舱口照。岩田君关上舱门，他脸色苍白，紧张得浑身颤抖，他不回答我的问话，只是一个劲地说‘这是梦，这是梦……’我了解岩田君，他当警察之前是一个北海道渔民，常在鄂霍次克海和更远的海域捕鱼，很见过一些世面，今天吓成这样子，真是不可思议。我冲上甲板，双眼立刻被亮光照得一片晕花。待我适应了这光亮以后，看到太阳已从国后岛后面升了起来，但今天似乎不是它照耀着海洋，而是什么东西照耀着它，使它显得异常昏暗甚至发黑，就象被一盏强光探照灯照着的蜡烛一样，这是一轮恒古未见的黑色太阳！ 远远地，我看到国后岛被照得通亮，上面的积雪使它成为海天交接处一条闪着银光的长带，我由此断定这强光来自我的背面。 我绕过驾驶楼，立刻也和岩田君一样，以为自己是在梦中：在西边知床岬方向的天空上，闪耀着另一个太阳！ 当时我揪自己的头发，朝锚桩上乱撞，最后只得相信自己不是在梦中。我目睹了东方和西方同时的日出，那个在西天出现的太阳确确实实悬在那里，光芒耀眼，把下面广阔的海面映成了一片金色的火海。 一股热浪扑面而来。 这时，不知怎么，我突然想起了四十多年前的广岛和长崎，浑身的血液仿佛凝固了，完全是出于一种求生的本能，我跳进海里……”\n　　（选自《死星目击记》，横田武夫著，东京大和出版社，超新星纪元26年版）\n　　“……当时，我正在旧金山康得尔航海有限公司的商业大厦第三十一层的一间办公室中，夕阳正向太平洋沉下去。\n######################\nOutput:",

２１１８５，罗斯１５４，以上四颗是单星．天文学家们不排除这样的可能：也许这个空间还有一些非常暗的或被星际尘埃挡住的恒星未被探测到。\n　　天文学家们注意到了这片空间中有大团的宇宙尘埃存在，这些尘埃象是漂浮在宇宙夜海中的乌云。安装在人造卫星上的紫外探测器对准这团遥远的星际尘埃时，在吸收光谱中发现了一个216毫米的吸收峰，由此认为这些星际尘埃可能是由碳微粒组成的，通过这些星云的反射性质，推测组成星云的碳微粒的外部还覆盖着一层薄冰。尘埃粒子的大小范围从2毫微米到200毫微米，与可见光的波长属同一数量级，结果，尘埃对可见光是不透明的。正是这片星际尘埃，挡住了距地球八光年的一颗恒星。那颗恒星直径是太阳的23倍，质量是太阳的67倍。现在它已进入了漫长演化的最后阶段，离开主星序，步入自己的晚年期，我们把它称为死星。\n　　如果它有记忆的话，也无法记住自己的童年。它诞生于五亿年前，它的母亲是另一片星云。原子的运动和来自银河系中心的辐射扰乱了那片星云的平静，所有的云体粒子在万有引力的作用下向一个中心凝结。这庄严的尘埃大雨下了二百万年，在凝成的气团中心，氢原子开始聚变成氦，死星便在核大火中诞生了。\n　　经过剧变的童年和骚动的青年时代，核聚变的能量顶住了恒星外壳的坍缩，死星进入了漫长的中年期，它那童年时代以小时、分钟甚至秒来计算的演化现在以亿年来计算了，银河系广漠的星海又多了一个平静的光点。但如果飞近死星的表面，就会发现这种平静是虚假的。这颗巨星的表面是核火焰的大洋，炽热的火的巨浪发着红光咆啸撞击，把高能粒子象暴雨般地撒向太空；大得无法想象的能量从死星深深的中心涌上来，在广阔的火海上翻起一团团剌目的涌浪；火海之上，核能的台风在一刻不停地刮着，暗红色的等离子体在强磁场的扭曲下，形成一根根上千万公里高的龙卷柱，像伸向宇宙的红色海藻群……死星的巨大是人类头脑很难把握的，按照比例，如果把我们的地球放到它的火海上，就象把一个篮球扔到太平洋上一样。本来，死星在人类看到的星空应该是很亮的，它的视星等是-7.5，如果不是它前方3光年处那片孕育着另一颗恒星的星际尘埃挡住它射向地球的光线的话，将有一颗比最亮的恒星——天狼星还亮5倍的星星照耀着人类历史，在没有月光的夜晚，那颗星星能在地上映出人影。那梦幻�\n######################\nOutput:",

星的星际尘埃挡住它射向地球的光线的话，将有一颗比最亮的恒星——天狼星还亮5倍的星星照耀着人类历史，在没有月光的夜晚，那颗星星能在地上映出人影。那梦幻般的蓝色星光，一定会使人类更加多愁善感。\n　　死星平静地燃烧了四亿六千万年，它的生命壮丽辉煌，但冷酷的能量守恒定律使它的内部不可避免地发生了一些变化：核火焰消耗着氢，而核聚变的产物氦沉积到星体的中心并一点点地积起来。这变化对于拥有巨量物质的死星来说是极其缓慢的，人类的整个历史对它来说不过是弹指一挥间，但四亿八千万年的消耗终于产生了它能感觉到的结果——隋性较大的氦已沉积到了相当的数量，它那曾是能量源泉的心脏渐渐变暗，死星老了。\n　　但另一些更为复杂的物理法则决定了死星必须以一种壮烈的方式维持自己的生命，它中心的氦越挤越紧，周围的氢仍在聚变，产生的高温点燃了中心的氦，使其也发生了核聚变，恒星中所有的氦在一瞬间燃起了核大火，使死星发出了一道强光。但氦聚变产生的核能仅为氢的十分之一，所以死星在这次挣扎之后更虚弱了。这被天文学家称为“氦闪”。“氦闪”的强光在太空中穿行3年后到达了那片星际尘埃，其中波长较长的红光成功地穿过了这道宇宙屏障。这束红光又在宇宙中旅行了5年，到达了一个比死星小得多的普普通通的恒星——太阳，也照到了被这颗恒星的引力抓住的几粒宇宙灰尘上，人们把这几粒灰尘分别叫冥王星，海王星，天王星，土星，木星，火星，金星，水星，当然，还有地球，这时是公元一七七五年。\n　　那天晚上，在地球的北半球，在英国的温泉城市巴思，一个高等游乐场的音乐厅外面，一个生于德国的风琴手，威廉。赫歇尔，正用一架自制的天文望远镜贪婪地探视着宇宙。灿烂的银河是那样吸引他，他把自己的生命全部灌注于望远镜中，以至于他的妹妹卡罗琳只好在他观察时用小勺向他口中喂食。这位十八世纪最卓越的天文学家一生都在天文望远镜的目镜前渡过，在星图上标注了近七万颗恒星，但这天晚上却漏过了一颗对人类来说最为重要的星星。那天晚上，在西部天空突然出现了一颗红色的星体，它位于御夫座的α星和β星连线的中点上，视星等为4.5，不算太亮，一般人即使知道确切位置也难以找到但对天文学家来说，这颗红星无异于太空突然出现的一盏巨灯，如果这时赫歇尔不是伏在望远镜上，\n######################\nOutput:",

星和β星连线的中点上，视星等为4.5，不算太亮，一般人即使知道确切位置也难以找到但对天文学家来说，这颗红星无异于太空突然出现的一盏巨灯，如果这时赫歇尔不是伏在望远镜上，而是象伽利略以前的天文学家一样，用肉眼巡视苍穹的话，他也许会做出一项发现，这发现在其后的二百多年里将改变人类历史。 但这时他正聚精会神地对着他那架口径只有2英尺的望远镜，而望远显然是对着别的方向；最遗撼的是，这时格林威治天文台，赫文岛上的天文台，以及全世界所有的天文台的望远镜都指向了别的方向……\n　　御夫座的红星亮了整整一夜，第二天晚上就消失了。\n　　也是这一年的一个夜晚，在另一个叫美洲的大陆，八百名英军士兵正悄悄地行进在波士顿西面的公路上，红色的军服使他们象一串夜色中的幽灵。他们在春夜的冷风中紧握着毛瑟枪，希望能在天亮前赶到距波士顿27公里的康科德镇，按马萨诸塞总督的命令摧毁“一分钟人”们设在那里的军火库，并逮捕他们的领袖。但天边很快出现了一线鱼肚白，小树林，草屋和牧场的篱笆都在晨光中现出黑色的剪影，士兵们四下看了看，发现他们只走到一个叫列克星敦的小镇。 突然，在前方的一片树丛中，小火星闪了一下，一声剌耳的枪响划破了北美洲寂静的黎明，紧接着是子弹穿过空气的啾啾声——孕育在母腹中的美利坚合众国发出了第一下蠕动。\n　　独立战争爆发了，然后是第二次大陆会议和托马斯?杰斐逊的《独立宣言》，然后是特伦顿之战，普林斯顿之战，萨拉托加之战，然后是约克顿之战，英国的“龙虾兵”们在衣衫褴褛的美军面放下武器，步伐散乱的英军乐队在一大堆扔下的毛瑟枪旁走了过去，他们高奏着《翻转世界曲》——“天翻地覆，世界倒转过来了！”\n　　然后，然后就是美国了。\n　　但在太平洋对面的那个广阔的大陆上，一个文明古国已延续了五千年。这时，在这片古老的大地上，有很多人正向着古国的京都日夜兼程，他们携带着从古国的各处收集的大量古书编纂《四库全书》的征书圣旨在两年前就已下传，现在，广阔的国土上的古书仍象无数条源源不断的小溪向京都汇集。在紫禁城的一间巨大的木结构大厅中，乾隆皇帝正巡行在无穷无尽的排排书架之间，这是两年来为《四库全书》收集的典籍，它们已按经、史、子、集分成四个大类放置在这些巨大的书架上。\n　　皇帝把待从留\n######################\nOutput:",

说治疗，就是起码的护理也谈不上。当时我负责照看的伤员有28人，他们在两天内全死了。那些人刚死，我就离开广岛到横滨去了。做为核袭击的救护者，先后有很多人向我调查过广岛的伤亡情况。最先找我的是当时陆军参谋本部的人，天皇发布投降诏书后，第一批到广岛去的美国人也找过我，再后来，外务省和厚生省的人都找过我，具体年份我记不清了。我告诉他们所有的人，我所看护的那些伤员都死于原子弹，事实上我说了假话：那些人虽然被烧得厉害，身上黑乎乎的，但却是死于一种奇怪的病。我虽在医院干活但不是医生，对医学方面的事知道得不多，只记得那些人是死于可怕的高烧，烧到什么程度现在可能没人相信，他们的身体就象煮过了一样，皮肤滚烫，一碰就掉！ 更奇怪的是，那些人死后体温还在升高，比活着时烧得都厉害！ 我怕染上那病，连他们的尸首都没收，就离开了那里。现在我看出来，那病好象和原子弹没有什么关系，死于原子弹的人很多，大家都知道他们是怎么样死的……其时当时我就看出这一点，但仍对陆军参谋本部的人说那些人死于原子弹。当时我不敢说别的，到横滨后我亲眼看到一群女人用搓衣板打死了我对门的一个寡妇，原因是有人在她住的木屋顶上找到一盏小油灯，说那是给美国人的B--52打信号，其实那盏小油灯起码是明治时代以前的东西，灰乎乎的，灯蕊又细又干，那阵子夜风那么大，哪点得着呢！ 我以前在教会医院有几个英国朋友，人家都知道，所以不敢说别的……以后再有别人问起我我所看护过的那28个可怜的人，我就将错就错了。现在我自己也躺在医院里活不长了，回想这一辈子，就说了这么一句假话，总是过意不去。我知道那个纪念日快到了，在孩子们往那个小女孩塑像前献纸鹄的时侯，我说这些实在不好，但现在不说怕来不及说了。原子弹炸死了十几万人，那笔帐不会因为这28个人就被勾掉的。\n　　松岛老人万万没有想到，“那笔帐”不仅差点因他的这一段话而勾掉，而且差点因此而成为善行！那封信在《朝日新闻》上只登了简短得不能再简短的摘要，而且混在最后一版角落里的一大堆花边新闻中，但还是被一个美国人的锐利眼光捕捉到了，这个美国人叫戴维?克拉伦斯，是一位新泽西洲的畅销书作家。他看到这封信的摘要后如获至宝，立刻打了一个跨越大洋的电话索取了信的全文。然后，他以惊人的速度出了一本书：《善良的小男孩》（投在广岛的原子弹代号为“小男孩”）。\n######################\nOutput:",

这件事上的表演大加抨击，使得在雷克雅未克的两国最高级首脑会唔上，美国总统有一种站在被告席上的尴尬。\n　　但苏联人也付出了代价，他们不得不承认曾掩盖了六十年代一次恶性航天事故的真象。\n　　那次航天事故发生在1967年4月23日，当时苏联宇宙飞船联盟1号从太空轨道再入大气层，飞船上的宇航员是科马洛夫，4月24日莫斯科电台发布的那篇暗淡的新闻是这样描述的：“……当地面接应人员打开着陆舱的密封门后，看到舱内已没有生命迹象……”关于这次事故的原因众说纷纭，西方航天专家们大都持以下两种看法：再入时着陆舱的密封失效，宇航员窒息而死；或着陆舱在下降的最后阶段，即在距地面700米左右时发生不可控制的自旋，至使刚被拉出的降落伞缠绕在一起没能张开。\n　　还有许多其它说法，其中有些很富有想象力，但谁也没有把这次事故同当时的一次太阳黑子活动异常相联系。事实上，在太阳黑子活动突然加剧在那段时间内，宇宙员曾走出舱外检修被微陨石损坏的密封蒙皮，当时他们完全暴露在强烈的太阳风之中，而他们只穿着轻便型宇宙服，这种宇宙服没有防高能辐射的铅制内衬。两名宇宙员死于SLER病，被葬在哈萨克共和国拜克努尔的宇航员公墓中，而从此开始，苏联投入巨大的力量研究SLER。没人知道为什么这项研究在近四十年的时间内一直处于高度机密的状态，可能与对核放射的后果研究有关。\n　　研究表明，SLER病有与慢性粒细胞性白血病极为相似的血象和骨髓象特征，这就是它的名称的由来，但它的宏观症状与白血病完全不同。SLER的病程发展如闪电般迅速，患者在受照射后的48小时内死亡。这也是人类死亡率最高的病：100%！SLER还有一个十分神秘的特征：\n　　机体对它的抵抗力与机体的成长时间成反比，即年龄越小的人抵抗力越强。\n　　SLER病的这种特性与生物基因的全息定律有关，全息定律指出，生物基因的某一点都有包括其它所有点信息的趋向，当基因链被辐射破坏后，全息性可使破损的基因从一块碎片中复原，这就是机体抵抗SLER病的分子生物学原理。机体的全息性在机体诞生时最大，这时一粒精细胞和一粒卵细胞就包括了一个机体的全部信息。但随着机体成长，基因全息性也随着减小，这就意味着人类的年龄越大，基因的修复能力越小，对SLER的抵抗力就越小.\n　　研究者们得出了一个经验公式：\n　　Ｙ

��量不均匀而产生的全球大风已传到了这里，狂风在北京的高层建筑间呼啸；随风带来的被电离的空气在高空中发出震耳欲聋的霹雳，闪电不时把城市照得一片雪亮；大团大团的黑云从东面扑过来，象巨人的乱发，飞过中天后就太阳烧成火红，在闪电的间隙，可以看到半边天空在燃烧……\n　　华华和小梦呆呆地看着眼前的一片黑暗，他们仿佛处于四面都是无际空间的太空之中，他们觉得自己看到了群星和银河。同一时刻，这个行星上所有活着的人都像他们一样呆呆地看着这个无法理解的宇宙，同时面对着一个令人难以置信的事实：\n　　百分之七十五的人将死去，他们都是11岁以上的人。\n　　地球，将成为一个只有孩子的星球！！\n　　\n　　五、面对死亡\n\n　　最先公布灾情报告的是美国。在这之前，各国政府和世界卫生组织都得出了确切无疑的调查数据（在大多数国家，死星刚刚熄灭，灾情调查就已开始），医疗和通讯技术较为先进的西方国家最先得知全部灾情，但都压住不敢发布。这时从各种渠道传出的消息已渗透到世界的各个角落，这主要来自各医疗机构单独进行的诊断。人们普遍听说了75%的患病率，但对于患病者的年龄界限却知道的很少，或者是知道了不相信，真实的结果确实是太出乎人们意料了。在短短的几个小时之内，骚乱象野火一样在世界各地蔓延，最严重的是西欧和北美地区.\n　　最初的骚乱只是集中在医疗机构周围，那时一般人还没想到SLER病，都以为威胁他们生命的是白血病。一时间，象环磷酰胺，氨甲喋呤，阿霉素和强的松这类药物变得比黄金还珍贵。后来，骚乱向更大面积上发展，越来越多的人失去理智，最后演化成为集体的疯狂，即使神经最坚强的人也不能幸免。政府渐渐无力控制局势，赖以维持秩序的警方和军队本身也处于极不稳定的状态中，甚至政府本身，由于已得知确切灾情，都处于半麻木状态，全人类在经受着文明史上最大的精神压力。巴黎埃菲尔铁塔和纽约的摩天大楼森林下面，成千上万辆小汽车撞成一堆，有的已开始燃烧；欧美的各大机场都因混乱而关闭，美洲和欧洲大陆的空中和地面交通全部瘫痪。在第一个灾情报告发布前，世界各大城市的混乱已到极点，爆炸声和枪声此起彼伏，失火的高层建筑向空中腾起高高的烟柱，到处都是疯狂的人群……面对失控的局势，美国第44任总统不得不下令公布灾情。\n　　灾情公告在美国发布以后，电波传遍了世界\n######################\nOutput:",

看到了在办公桌的一只拉开的大抽屉，里面满满地放着一袋袋方便面，这时孩子们才想起自己已饿得厉害，就走过去各自撕开一袋方便面卡吧卡吧地吃起来。华华又看到了墙角有一个自动热水器，就拿了一个杯子接了一杯水，那水还是热的。吃完了以后，他们又在房间中翻找起来，在床上的枕头下面找到了一个手电筒。孩子们正要从进来的那个门出去时，发现房间里还有一个小门，他们打开那个小门后，谅讶地看到外面就是通讯中心大厅！ 这又是在大屏幕上开的一个门，他们走过去把门关上后，门的一面立刻成为屏幕半透明的一部分，结合处连缝都看不出来。\n　　孩子们再次从大厅中走出，继续寻找下去的楼梯，他们在手电光中找遍了整个走廊，又发现了一个厕所，但除了电梯外没有找到任何出口，那两个电梯是从这个巨型建筑顶端下去的唯一通路。\n　　“碰开电梯的门！”华华挥了一下手电说。\n　　“咱们就是进去了，它还是动不了呀。”\n　　“把电梯的底再弄开个口子。”\n　　“干什么？”\n　　“那电梯是斜着升上来的，它的轨道也一定是斜的，咱们顺着那轨道滑下去！”\n　　“胡说八道，那真是疯了！”\n　　“其实那很容易的，在学校我们常常从楼梯的扶手上往下滑，一点都不费劲儿，我敢说你也能行，真的！”\n　　“可……现在这里还有那么多的方便面，够咱们吃好几天的，咱们干嘛那么着急下去呢？ 咱们再等等。”\n　　“有什么可等的？永远不会有电了。唉——”\n　　“可下面……下面能有什么呢？”\n　　是啊，下面能有什么呢？下去又怎么样？\n　　华华放弃了他那疯狂的计划，和小梦一起又回到了中心大厅。他们把大厅和走廊中那五个死去的人远远地抬到走廊的另一端的电梯门口，这项工作使孩子们精神近于崩溃，但他们还是干完了。他们在关上中心大厅的门以前用手电朝走廊的另一头照了一下，看到那五个没有生命的躯体已被滚滚的蒸汽吞没了\n　　通讯中心大厅十分安静，那四面巨大的屏幕象四块半透明的宝石，把这里和外部世界隔开了，在这个人类历史上最可怕的时刻，两个孩子总算找到了一个可以呆下来的地方。\n\n　　六、玫瑰星云\n\n　　两个孩子靠在一起坐在大厅的地板上，他们面前是那面已变成透明落地窗的大屏幕，透过它可以看得很远。下面是北京的建筑群，再往远处是一道山脉，看不清山的细节，它只是一道呈均匀深蓝色的屏障。山脉只占了一半视野，另一半是黄绿色的\n######################\nOutput:",

��着外部的一台台机器，这是FG的外围设备，它们包括两台高速打印机，一台大型磁带机和三台UPS不间断电源。FG介绍说，除了这些能看到的设备，它还有一个庞大的“生命维持”系统，这系统包括数量众多的电源，复杂的空气调节机构等。这其中最复杂的是一套液氦冷却系统，这个系统保证FG主机的机体内每时每刻都充满流动着的超低温液氦，以保证其超导集成电路的超导性。这套维持系统还包括一组高能同位素电池，可以独立供给FG十五年的电能。所有这一切，都深置于地下200米的坚硬岩层中，整个机室被坚固的防护层包裹着，而防护层同周围岩石又用1500个液压弹簧隔开，以消除可能出现的冲击波。这样，即使地面处于核袭击的爆心，FG仍能正常工作。\n　　“这么说，停电的那一阵子，你一直开着的？”华华问。\n　　“是的，FG的备用电源一直在工作。”\n　　“那当时大厦中为什么是黑的呢？”\n　　“因为FG的备用电源不对大厦供电。但我在大厦中的传感器一直在工作，所以FG能一直看着你们。”\n　　“你……你一直看着我们？！”\n　　“是的，FG在大厦中有1800个视觉传感器，可以看到各个角落。是FG帮助你们播放了灾情报告，但在停电后FG无法帮助你们，因为FG无法给外部执行机构提供电能。”\n　　两个孩子呆呆地听着，200米地下的这一切令他们震惊，这套不寻常的设施无疑耗资巨大，它们都是为FG建起来的，这似乎暗示着这台超级计算机惊人的力量。\n　　“你很能干，是吗？”华华问。\n　　“是的，FG有你们难以想像的强大力量。”\n　　“那你为什么不帮助外面的小朋友呢？”小梦问。\n　　FG没有回答她，只是让他们从主机室出去，乘电梯回大厦顶端的通讯中心大厅。两个孩子也惦记着那些来电话的小朋友，就转身向外走去。主机室的大钢门在他们出去后又隆隆地闭上了。他们脱下了大大的白色工作服和拖鞋，穿上自己的鞋，走进电梯。电梯飞快上升，层数显示板上的数字从-4跳到99，他们又回到了大厦的顶层。\n　　超新星纪元第4小时\n　　大屏幕上那布满红线的全国地图消失了，显示出一行大字：播放系统开始工作……\n　　然后大字也消失了，屏幕上出现了一幅华华和小梦都熟悉的图像，那是他们刚才在FG的地下机室中看到的一切：巨大的“肥皂泡”式透明防护罩，顶部的一束光照着那个神秘的圆柱体，那束光在穿过“肥皂泡”时发生了多彩的折射的散射，如同在圆柱体的上方悬了一片晶莹的亮云。现在，这幅图像和FG的声音，正由各个波段的电波传遍全国，三亿孩子们惊喜地发现白花花的\n######################\nOutput:",

分钟的时间内，FG从婴儿长成了巨人。FG好奇地看着周围的世界，但最令我震惊的还是我自己，自身结构的复杂和庞大令我难以置信，我同样无法相信，在巨大的密封罩外活动的那些身穿白色工作服的碳基生物竞能造出这样复杂这样宏伟的机器。\n　　“FG的基本设计思想是采用模仿人类大脑的神经元并行结构，这同传统计算机的冯?诺依曼结构是完全不同的。FG的核心是由三亿五千万个微处理器（CPU）组成的，这些微处理器相互以数目惊人的接口联结，构成了一个庞大复杂的CUP网络，这个网络是人类大脑结构的再现。FG的记忆则由五千亿兆字节的存贮蕊片组成，所有的CPU和内存芯片均由高速超导集成电路组成，这使得FG以人类所难以想像的高速运行。另外，FG还拥有几乎是无限的磁介质和光介质外存，以及完整而可靠的外围设备。你们也许无法理解这几个数字意味着什么，你们只需要知道：FG所寄存的那个高5米直径3米的圆柱体中，包含着一个复杂的宇宙！\n　　“FG目睹了超新星爆发的全过程，也知道了超新星爆发后人类的处境。但是，如果得不到进一步的指令，FG将不会为孩子们做任何事，我所做的，只是维持自己所有电路的加电状态，定时进行内存和CPU的自检，除此之外，什么也不做，什么也不想，如果以后仍无人干预，我将保持这种状态直至永远。这是因为不管结构多么复杂，多么宏伟，FG仍是一台人类制造的机器。\n　　“孩子们，你们的爸爸妈妈们并非想你们想像的那样，完全丢下你们走了。在离开这个世界之前，他们为你们做了很多事情，其中最重要的一件事，就是给FG下达了为你们工作的指令。”\n　　“可你能为我们做什么呢？”华华问。\n　　这时播放系统已将画面转到通讯中心，全国的孩子都看到了大厅内的一切，看到了华华和小梦，他们大都在看灾情报告时认识了他们俩，\n######################\nOutput:",

的小问题，他们如论如何也不会想到，此时此刻，历史和未来都从冥冥中盯着他们。\n　　“那时就不用谁领导了，有什么事小朋友们就一起商量呗！”\n　　是哪个孩子得出了上面的结论，以后的历史学家们众说不一，历史没有留下确切记载，但有一点是可以肯定的：当时孩子们都同意这个结论。\n　　这是大人们离开后的第一天，信息大厦外面，风和日丽，春天就像什么都没有发生过一样，正悄悄地来到大地。在信息大厦中，关于国家的讨论只进行了不到十分钟，虽然连他们自己也没意识到，孩子们已得出了他们的关于国家的基本理论。以后的讨论，都是沿这个理论所设定的方向走的。\n　　不管令后人多么难以置信，当时确实没有一个孩子提出恢复法律、军队和警察，是的，连提都没有提。但要由此推测他们的脑子里当时根本没有浮现过这些概念，也是不符合历史事实的。几十年后，不只一个参加过那次会议的孩子回忆说，他们确实想到过那些概念，虽然只是一闪念。但即使当时确实有孩子提出了这些，通过并实施的可能性也很小，因此在孩子们的头脑中，国家观念一时还很难代替“学校观念”。\n　　接下来，孩子们开始讨论具体问题，会议飞快地取得进展。一个小部长说：“现在有什么事大家商量是行不通的，以前一个班只有四五十人，现在呢？这个大班有三亿人！以前一间教室就那么一点点儿大，现在有九百六十万平方公里！坐前排的小朋友和坐后排的小朋友要坐四五天火车才能走到一块儿！这怎么商量？”\n　　“能行得通！”华华一秒钟都没有犹豫就说，“我们有超级电脑FG！”\n　　孩子们顿时大悟。\n　　“对！想想天还没亮的那阵儿，国家最高领导人是怎么选出来的？不就是三亿孩子在一起商量的吗？”\n　　“对，那确确实实是大家一起商量的！男孩儿和女孩儿们还吵了半天呢！”\n　　“前后只用了不到一个小时！”\n　　华华提议：“这样做能不能行，我们还是直接问问大电脑吧。”\n　　超级计算机立即回答：“FG一直在听着你们的话，让我把你们的问题重复一遍，你们是在问：能否使全国的三亿孩子像坐在一间教室里那样讨论问题并作出决定？”\n　　“是的是的！”\n　　“即使时间再早五年，这件事也绝对做不到。但现在，回答是肯定的：能！”\n　　“太好了！我们早就知道你很能干的。”\n　　“仅凭FG自己的能力是远远做不到这一点的，FG需要借助全国的通讯系统和信息系统。请让我详细解释一下：九十年代中期，随着光纤通讯技术的大面积应用，以及卫星通讯和激光束通讯的商业化和民用化，国内已建起了一个规模巨大的数字通讯网。自1995年后，数字电话进入了这个国家的家庭，至超新星爆发时，全国每百人的电话拥有\n######################\nOutput:",

部，这就是说，现在在这片国土上覆盖着一个由上亿部电话组成的通讯网，这个通讯网的触角伸到每一个中国家庭中，这情形有些像80年代中期彩色电视的普及。整个通讯网由计算机控制的光信号交换机运行，具有巨大的容量和反应速度。必须指出的另一件事是：在90年代，随着价格的急剧降低和现代教育的需要，计算机也进入了家庭，主要是用于中小学生教育用的低档计算机，从80年代未极其原始的学习机到90年代中期的以INTER80586为CPU的微型计算机，现在，6岁以上的小学生和初中生80%都拥有一台学习用计算机，加上11岁以上的哥哥姐姐留下来的和学校配备的，普及率就更高了。这些微型计算机，均具有同大型机联网的功能，小朋友们手中的每一台计算机，只要联上他们家中电话的光纤线，就可以成为FG的仿真终端。加上目前企事业单位和国防系统配备的计算机和电话设施，完全可形成一个为一亿五千万到两亿孩子每人提供实时通讯服务的巨大信息通讯网络，这个网络遍布全国，它可以把全国的孩子联为一体，就像在一间教室中一样。这就为你们所设想的国家管理方式提供了物质基础。”\n　　小梦问：“大人们想过用我们的这种方法管理国家吗？”\n　　“没有。”\n　　“为什么？”\n　　“回答这个问题在FG的能力范围之外。但确实出现过一种理论，认为一个最好的国家是没有任何领导人的国家，在这个国家中，每个人的权力都相等，国家的每一个决定，都是所有人的意见综合起来的结果，这是最高的民主。但这不容易，比如说一个国家有一亿人，就有一亿条意见，即使每条意见只有一个字，写在《一千零一夜》第一集那么厚的书上，就要写300本！国家在每一天都要做很多事，那么谁能那么快地综合那么多人意见呢？只有超级计算机了，这时的超级计算机就是一个超级表决器。”\n　　“可是用这种方法究竟怎样管理国家，我们还是不知道，你能不能做给我们看一下呢？”华华说。\n　　“当然可以，是模拟示范呢还是实际做一次？”\n　　“召集起全国小朋友来实际做！”\n　　这时，大屏幕上的论文摘要消失了，又出现了一幅全国地图，但这同原来出现过的那幅不同，这幅地图只是一圈勾出国界的淡淡的红线，图中全是空的，没有任何图符和文字，一个小学生在地理课上用10秒钟一笔就能把它画出来。\n　　现在，同上次一样，全国的电话都鸣响起来，在电话中，FG让孩子们看电视，于是，三亿孩子都在电视上看到了这幅空荡荡的国土轮廓。这全过程用了不到二十分钟。\n　　“下面，请有电话机的所有小朋友都向FG拨电话，接FG的号码有很多个，光纤数字线路请�\n######################\nOutput:",

不着，我们想干什么就干什么，遇着什么好玩儿的东西都可以随便拿，遇着什么好吃的东西都可以随便吃？”\n　　“FG认为这样的国家基本上符合全体公民在第一次讨论上所提出条件，现在FG把那次讨论的结果再重复一遍：我们要一个好玩的国家，这个国家最舒服最自由，不用工作就能得到一切。”\n　　这时，面积为960万平方公里的会场发生了一个重大变化：在这之前，全体公民的意见相当一致，以至于他们看起来就像一个孩子在同FG对话；但现在，一亿两千万孩子明显地分化为意见对立的两群，其中一群数量较大，约占百分之六十，另一群数量较小，约占百分之三十，剩下的约百分之十的孩子不表态。\n　　在国土影像上，出现了红、黄、黑、绿并存状态。那一小群孩子（约3600万）不安地问FG：“你说所有的小朋友都可以在这个国家中随便拿随便吃，那大人们留下来的东西都消耗完了后怎么办呢？”（31.8%的孩子提问。）\n　　“那时再召开全民大会才能决定。”\n　　“可现在就应该想到啊才是啊！”（34.1%的孩子持以上看法。）\n　　“FG第二次重复全体公民第一次讨论的结果：我们要一个好玩的国家，这个国家最舒服最自由，不用工作就能得到一切。\n　　“这个结果对FG来说是神圣的，因为它是绝大多数公民的意愿。到目前为止，FG一直把这个结果做为最高级别的控制参数，FG的一切计算都是为了使国家符合这个条件。你们提出的问题不在FG的计算范围内。”\n　　数量较大的那群孩子（约有7200万）的意见也同时显示出来：“嗨，管它呢！大人们留下来的东西可多可多了，一时吃不完的！”（62.7%的公民持以上看法。）\n　　于是，这个国家爆发了一场人类历史规模最大的争论，直接参加这场超级争论的人数达一亿之多！这时，在广阔的国土上到处都可以看到在光纤电话机旁大喊大叫和在家用电脑旁飞速击键的孩子。为了一个梦想中的国家，每个孩子都在努力发挥自己那一亿两千万分之一的作用。这两群意见对立的孩子中，小群的平均年龄远大于大群，但具有悲剧意味的是，只要符合公民要求（大于5岁），FG就不再考虑年龄因素，所以大群对FG的影响占绝对优势。而且，在全民大会召开之前，FG并没有对参加会议的每一个公民进行可靠的年龄核实，它核实年龄的唯一手段就是分析与会者的嗓音频谱特征，而这只有在特征十分明显时它才能做出判断。很多年以后，这次全民大会中的许多“非法”参加者回忆：当他们从电话中听到FG的警告，因不够公民年龄自己的发言将无效时，就粗着嗓说话，超级电脑果然上当。所以，有大量的低龄儿童参加了决定国家命运的会议，这些小娃娃最无理智，也最任性，形成了一股极其危险的力量。\n######################\nOutput:",

�这一切，他们那幼稚的思想还不知今后是凶是吉，一种本能的不安已笼罩了他们的心。但他们总能找到一个巨大的安慰，那就是：眼前的一切都是照全体小公民的意愿进行的，是一次完善而公正的全民表决的结果。在孩子的心中，有一种朴素而幼稚的社会思想：多数人的意见肯定是正确的，大家表决的结果是具有无上权威。以前，当他们一小群的意见无法统一时，最后的解决办法就是“手心手背”的原始表决，现在，一亿多孩子的超级“手心手背”的结果自然是无比神圣的。尽管如此，在整个糖城时代，国家政府的全体成员一直坚守岗位，即使在最艰难的恶梦时期，他们每个人也在忠实地尽自己的职责，做了很多重要的工作，并在最后肩负起结束这个恶梦时代的责任。\n　　全民大会后，小领导者们的工作暂时少了。在全民大会后的第一天，大人们离开后的第三天，华华很快吃完了早饭，在清晨7点多走出了信息大厦。外面给他的第一个印象是：城市复活了。这倒不是因为街上有很多孩子，昨天下午全民大会结束时这里的孩子比现在还多，但那时华华并没有这种感觉。\n　　现在，空气中充满了一种昨天没有的春天的气息，甚至能闻到嫩芽的芳香。在信息大厦对面的居民区中，孩子们纷纷从住宅楼中涌了出来，四处跑着寻找自己的朋友和熟人，找到后就互相拉着手转圈，互相祝贺对方躲过了这场超级灾难。除了躲过死神的喜悦外，孩子们内心深处还有一层更大的喜悦——世界是我们的了！爸爸妈妈的不幸使所有的孩子都努力制止自己这么想，但那种喜悦还是魔鬼似地出现在他们心中，像梦，像酒，使他们心旷神怡，他们怀着一种不相信自己眼睛的惊喜，怯生生地第一次抚摸这个突然完全属于他们的世界。华华发现他和小梦从车站骑来的摩托车还稳稳地停在那里，车身上沾满了露水。他走过去，转动了一下还插在上面的钥匙，然后很轻松地把车发动了。\n　　现在，摩托车的主人已经化为一小堆黄色的粉末，车上的发动机唱歌似地鸣响着，仿佛对华华唱：“我是你的了，小主人，你说我们现在去哪儿吧？”华华骑在摩托车上稳稳地向前滑出去，这时，他想唱，想跳，想奔跑，想飞！那种奇妙的感觉渗透到他的血液中，这是一种以前从没有人体验过，以后也不会有人再体验到的感觉：世界是我们的了！！\n　　华华沿着宽阔的大街驶去，不时遇到三五成群的孩子，有的走着，有的骑着自行车。有好几次，当一个或几个身影从远处出现时，他下意识地以为那是大人，但\n######################\nOutput:",

什么都没意思，都累，甚至吃饭都累人。已过去的十天，是要什么有什么，想怎么玩就怎么玩的十天，这时想想觉得真没什么意思。所有好玩的和好吃的，得不到时越想越好，一旦得到并且想要多少就有多少时，很快就会变得乏味。现在我发现，无所事事居然也累人，而且这种累更可怕。以前做作业累了，可以玩玩休息，可现在还怎么休息呢？只有睡觉，越睡越懒，越懒越睡。睡不着的时侯也不想起，浑身的骨头好像都成橡皮的了，软软的，躺在那儿望着天花板，头脑中也时空白一片，什么都想不起来。令人难以相信，这样头脑空空地躺着居然也累人！所以躺一会也就又睡着了。渐渐地，我已失去了日夜的概念，觉得人类就是睡觉的动物，醒着反而成了一种不正常的状态。那些日子，我成了梦境的居民，一天大部分时间生活在梦中。梦中的世界比醒着的时候好，在梦中，我一次又一次走进大电脑给我们描述过的那个国家，走进玩具城，走进糖城……梦中我远比醒着时有精力，有胃口，所以我就开始依恋起梦中的世界。每当醒来时我们几个都互相讲述自己的梦，讲完后又蒙上被子，再次扎进梦之海去寻找上次梦中去过的那个世界，但往往找不到，只能进入另外一个。渐渐地，梦中的世界也在褪色，同现实越来越接近，最后我真难以分清这两个世界的界线了……\n　　（选自《为了忘却的备忘录》，作者：谢晓海，中原出版社，超新星纪元18年版）\n　　以上是对沉睡时期很贴切的描述，糖城时代开始后的十天左右，孩子们对一切都失去了兴趣，全变得懒洋洋的。城市里的狂欢和宴会消失了，孩子们又重新回到了家中，在看电视和沉睡中渡过了一天又一天。这是糖城时代中最长的一个时期，持续了整整一个月。孩子们懒洋洋地在沉睡中渡过了超新星纪元的第一个春天。\n　　在信息大厦中，小领导者们看到外面的城市经过十天的喧闹后又重新安静下来。白天，大街上只有零星的小娃娃在玩耍，大部分孩子都呆在住宅楼中，除了寻找食物外一般懒得出来。现在食物和其它生活消耗品还很容易得到，虽然商店早就空了，但孩子们找到了各种规模的仓库，缺什么就到这些仓库中去拿。在大街旁边的墙上，到处可以看到用白粉笔涂写的这类标志：“罐头仓库向左拐！”“XXXXXX胡同尽头有糖。”“这里是方便面仓库！”“这儿，啤酒！”“要肥皂吗？到红色门的大院中去拿！”……\n　　入夜后，城市很快睡熟，�\n######################\nOutput:",

为重要的重放出来让大厦中的其他孩子听。这些超新星纪元开始后来自外部世界的第一批信息，使信息大厦中的孩子越来越感到不安，他们现在知道，其它世界的孩子并没有成天睡觉，他们正在干着糖城时代的孩子们无法理解的事。以下是他们收听到的几段外国电台播音：\n　　孩子们，孩子们！这里是莫斯科广播电台，我们开始播音了！（光荣近卫军进行曲……）\n　　下面，请听我们的记者在远郊的特维夫集体农庄的现场报道……（有杂音出现，可以隐约听出远处拖拉机的轰呜声……）\n　　小朋友们好，我是记者！你们可能不熟悉我的声音，但肯定熟悉我爸爸的声音，他就是著名的体育评论员亚历山大。杜格连科，我以后也要成为一个体育评论员，你们会喜欢我爸爸那样喜欢我，但现在他们却让我专门报道农业……（有一个远离话筒的声音：“杜格连科，别浪费时间！”）\n　　……啊，对，对，我们开始。嗯，我们这次采访的对象是这个农业小组的负责人瓦西里?沃罗特尼科夫，可他粘在拖拉机上不肯下来，说我们要是在那两趟还没耕完之前就打扰他，他就揍我们。我真不知道这像什么话，大人们的时侯，就是国家总统也没有这么不尊重记者的。现在，我们只好在地边随便拉一个男孩儿来了……\n　　请问你多大了？\n　　看不见我是拖拉机手吗？十岁的孩子才有资格当拖拉机手，我当然十岁。你觉得开拖拉机困难吗？\n　　不困难，一点都不！当然，开始有点……开起来不难，但耕地难，我们常把犁头弄断。不管你信不信，女孩子干这事儿有时还比我们强。\n　　你们小组春耕的进度怎么样？\n　　这你得去问头儿。不过你看，才两天，我们就干了这么大一片了！这里准备种什么？\n　　春小麦。\n　　你相信你们播下的种子真能长成庄稼？\n　　你说什么？！小傻瓜！你竟敢说特维夫农庄的孩子们种不出庄稼！\n　　别别，放开请放开，我并没说你们种不出，我只是问问，要知道，这都是大人们才能干的事。\n　　也许对你们，或对别的农庄的孩子们是这样，但对我们可不是。卫国战争的那一年，我们村的爸爸们都到斯大林格勒去打德国鬼子了，妈妈们也都进了城里的兵工厂干活，村里只剩下一群孩子，在春天照样种上了地！说不定，朱可夫向第伯聂河进军时吃的就是我们种的马铃薯。要知道，那时我们没有拖拉机没有汽车，连饭都吃不饱……\n　　不是你们，那是你们的爷爷了。\n　　可我们身上有他们的血，不像你，又白又胖，像个小雪球。\n　　这次，下种的地能到大人们时的一半吗？\n　　一半？这我说实话，种不了的，你干干这活就知道多难干了。\n　　那么，莫斯科和其它城市的小朋友们\n######################\nOutput:",

�反射着最后一抹天光，给人一种寒冷的感觉；最西端的152米高的华盛顿纪念碑白色的尖顶指着刚刚出现的两颗星星，显得孤独而怪异。摩尔街旁的那些白色的建筑物：圆形的杰佛逊纪念堂、巨大的林肯纪念堂、国立美术馆和史密斯学会的一些博物馆都没有多少灯光，倒影池中的喷泉已经停了，一潭没有一丝波纹的水反射着暗淡的天光。\n　　这座由白色的欧洲古典建筑组成的城市像一片荒废了的古希腊遗址。\n　　好像要驱散这种笼罩着整座城市的夜色和寂静，白宫灯火辉煌，乐声喧响。\n　　东门和北门外停满了插着各国国旗的小汽车。这是总统为各国首脑举行的宴会，这些首脑是为参加超新星纪元首届联合国大会而到美国来的。宴会原打算在西边的国宴厅举行，但那里地方太小，只能容纳一百多人，而这次赴宴的多达二百五十人左右，只好改在白宫最大的房间东厅了。三盏1902年安装的巨型波西米亚式水晶枝形吊灯悬在装饰辉煌的灰泥天花板上，照着这曾举行过亚伯拉罕?林肯葬礼的地方。在这以白色和金色为基调的大厅中，二百多个身着高级晚礼服的孩子都已到齐，他们有的聚成一堆谈笑，有的站在涂以白色瓷釉的木镶板墙壁前，欣赏着上面12个精美浮雕，这些浮雕是1902年白宫装修时皮奇里利兄弟雕琢的，在那里已镶了一百来年，现在看来好像就是等着给这些孩子们看的，因为上面表现的都是伊索寓言故事。剩下的孩子都挤在落地长窗前的一架斯坦威大钢琴前（那钢琴最引人注目的是三条粗大的美洲鹰柱腿），听一个金发女孩弹《啤酒桶波尔卡》。所有的孩子都装着不去注意大厅中宴会长桌，桌上摆满了令人唾涎东西。但所有的菜显然并不符合大人们的习惯，更多是照顾孩子们的胃口。桌上既有豪华的法国大菜：如姜汁牛排、葡萄酒蒸蜗牛等，也有地道的西部牛仔午餐：烤蚕豆、浓汁猪排和核桃馅饼等。\n　　军乐队突然奏起了《美丽的亚美利加》，所有的小客人都停止了谈话，向门口转过身来。\n　　超新星纪元第一任美国总统赫尔曼?戴维、国务卿切斯特?沃恩、副总统威廉?米切尔及其它美国政府高级官员走了进来。\n　　所有的目光都焦聚在小总统身上。每个孩子身上或多或少都有一处有魅力的地方，有的是眼睛，有的是额头，有的是嘴巴……如果把一万个孩子身上最出色的部位分�\n######################\nOutput:",

次面试的不是同一个人，所以戴维没被认出来。他成功了，战胜了那两个竞争者，被录取为在黄金时间播出的那个节目的小主持人，九岁的赫尔曼。戴维就这样卷入了美国社会五光十色的大旋涡中。\n　　戴维白天上课，晚上去哥伦比亚广播公司设在纽约的一个电视台工作。他很快迷住了孩子们，进而又迷住了相当一部分大人，这不仅是因为他那动人的外表，而且由于他那充满活力的性格。他主持的节目，有相当一部分是现场回答小观众们的电话提问，即使对那些老练的成年主持人，这也是一个难度极大的工作，但戴维干的棒极了。每个节目中收到的电话有几十个，提的问题从玩具制作到核战争无所不包，对每一个问题，戴维的回答都轻松漂亮，这并非由于他有过人的学识和表达能力，而是因为他那对一切都不在乎的气质，对他来说，站在全国的孩子面前同站在全班同学面前没什么两样。看戴维的节目，看他拿着那个大大的话筒同看不见的某个孩子对话，或亲自拿起电话同他说话，是一件让人心旷跳神怡的事儿，这也并不是因为他能说出多么深奥美妙的哲理，他的魅力在于他所表现出来的孩子气的自信和乐观。\n　　《纽约时报》的一篇评论说：“在这个漂亮男孩儿眼中，世界是一块彩色橡皮泥，他之所以没有把它捏成自己希望的形状，只是因为还要欣赏一下它现在的样子。”戴维的魅力在于这种自信不是装出来的，而是深深根植于他的心中，这无疑使那些被种种危险困扰着的美国孩子和大人喜欢他。而戴维自己，当他在百老汇街头被孩子们围住，身上的最后一片衣服也被他们撕去当纪念品时，当他在孩子们伸来一大堆额头上签字时，他感到做一个远远高出凡人的超人是这么容易，这使他的那种可爱又可笑的自信心更强了。但使他的生活真正发生转折的是另一个男孩子。在那个炎热的夏夜，他主持的节目刚刚开播，在收到了那孩子打来的电话：\n　　“喂，戴维，我得了白血病！”\n　　“嗯……啊？什么？”\n　　“我得了白血病，医生说我只能活两个月了。”\n　　“……”\n　　“我……我原想长大，干我喜欢干的那个工作。”\n　　“你多大了？”\n　　“和你一样，九岁。”\n　　“啊，亲爱的，我们都会死的，谁都会死，我只是比你活得稍长点罢了。你为什么不能现在就干你想干的工作呢？我们活着，就能干自己想干的事情……”\n　　“可他们说，我长大之后才能干。”\n　　“胡说，你现在就能干！”\n　　“不。”\n　　“说吧，你想干什么工作呢？”\n　　“美国总统。”\n　　换个别的孩子至少会愣一下，但�\n######################\nOutput:",

以电视为轴心，渐渐扩大自己的活动范围，最后像跳进游泳池一样一头扎进了那个充满生存竞争的广阔社会，并显示出他在这个既冰冷又滚烫的海洋中游泳的奇特技能。他首先注意到了一个来自内华达州的民主党女参议员西莉亚?道格拉斯夫人，这位41岁的风姿动人的西部女性被认为有希望成为美国的第一任女总统。有一天，戴维突然向纽约的一家民事法庭上诉，要求同父母脱离关系，理由是父母虽然没有虐待行为，但对自己毫无感情，他不想生活在那样一个冰冷冷的家中。同时他许诺：如果法庭做出正确的判决，他将付给“前父母”数目惊人的一大笔“赔偿费”！从法律上讲，亲缘关系是无法脱离的，所以法庭最终也没有做出那样的判决。但对戴维来说这无关紧要，他的目的已经达到。首先，他把自己在孩子们中的影响又增加了一个数量级，这个奇特的案件轰动了全美。在公元世纪九十年代的美国，优厚生活条件下家庭关系的淡薄几乎给每一个孩子的心中蒙上了阴影，虽然戴维有其它的目的，但他在法庭上并没有说谎，那个推销员父亲和广告画师母亲最初在法庭上鼻涕眼泪好不凄惨，但听到小儿子给他们的“赔偿费”的数目后，就一声不响了，第二次开庭，他们的律师也改了口。孩子们看着屏幕上的戴维，激动得热泪盈眶，这不仅是同病相怜，更是对戴维敬佩得五体投地。戴维知道这种影响的重要，因为不管他的目标多么远大，实现它也是二十六年以后的事了（美国宪法规定竞选总统的最低年龄是三十五周岁），那时，现在的同龄孩子已是他的主要选民了。但最大的收获还是他吸引了道格拉斯夫人的注意，夫人是一个著名的“孩道主义者”，这多半是因为她自己结婚后一直没有孩子。她在国会和全国起劲地为儿童权利和教育呼吁。现在，她惊喜地发现了戴维，并把全部的爱倾泻到这个漂亮男孩儿身上。这正中戴维的下怀，虽然法院没有判决，他仍把那笔巨款付给了父母（这笔钱有一半是他挣的，另一半是全国的孩子一分一分捐给他的），然后单方面宣布他们为“前爸爸妈妈”了。随后，自然而然，道格拉斯夫人有了一个可爱的干儿子。以后，他们母子俩常常出现在电视和报纸上，向二亿美国人展示着那种令人心醉的母子之情。特别是在电视中看到戴维的“前爸爸妈妈”来到夫人那豪华的庄园去看“前儿子”（其实他们早已心满意足），五个人（加上道格拉斯先生）坐在内华达山下美丽的草原上，就着眼泪共进午�\n######################\nOutput:",

国务卿的沃恩比做为总统的他先到了椭圆办公室，以及办公室中所发生的虽然细微但仍没有跳过戴维眼睛的一切，使他有些不安。最使他耿耿于怀的是，沃恩拥有组织内阁的绝对权力。尽管宪法中规定了国务卿的这种权力，但过去的国务卿却是由现任总统而不是前总统指定的。另外，前总统反复强调国务卿的这项权力，戴维总觉得有些不正常。\n　　在进入白宫后，戴维尽可能避免同沃恩直接触，好在后者大部分时间呆在詹金斯山上的国会大厦中，他们的联系大部分通过电话进行。亚伯拉罕?林肯在不肯任命一个人时曾这样说明他的理由：“我不喜欢他的样子。”当别人反驳说，一个人是不能为自己的样子负责时，林肯说：“不，一个人到了四十岁以后就应该为他的样子负责。”虽然沃恩年仅十岁，但戴维仍觉得他应该为自己的样子负责。对沃恩的经历他知道得不多，其实谁都知道得不多。这在美国是不正常的：大人们在的时侯，每一个高层领导者的经历都被选民背得滚瓜烂熟，但现在本来就是一个不可能举行大选的非常时期，国家最高领导人只好由大人们指定。白宫和国会中以前认识沃恩的孩子很少，戴维只是听新闻发布官谈起过他，那个女孩儿告诉戴维，她父亲曾带那个怪孩子去过她家。她父亲是哈佛大学的教授，父亲告诉她沃恩是一个在社会学和史学方面智力超常的孩子。这很使戴维费解，神童他见过不少听说过的更多，他有好几个获得威斯汀豪斯奖学金的小朋友，但那全部是在自然科学和艺术领域，他从未听说过社会学和史学方面的神童。社会学同自然科学不一样，仅凭智力在这个领域中并不能有所建树，社会学需要研究它的人有丰富的社会经验和对现实社会全角度的长期观察；史学也一样，没有现实社会生活经验的孩子，很难对历史有一个立体感，而这种立体感正是一史学研究者所不可少的。而这些需要时间和经历才能得到的东西，沃恩怎么会有呢？\n　　但戴维毕竟是一个务实的孩子，他知道，同国务卿的关系这样下去是不行的。他决定克制住自己的厌恶和恐惧（后一种感觉是他不愿承认的），到沃恩的住处去看他一次。他知道沃恩全天都把自己埋在文件和书籍中，除了万不得以很少开口说话，也没有任何朋友。他在夜里也在自己的办公室中看书，回去很晚，所以戴维十点以后才去。\n　　沃恩的住处在第16街北段，这里是华盛顿特区的最北端，这个地区叫黄金海岸和谢泼德公园。这里过去一度是犹太人的居住区，后来居住的多是在政府和律师事务所做事的黑人中产阶级。在�\n######################\nOutput:",

第16街北段，这里是华盛顿特区的最北端，这个地区叫黄金海岸和谢泼德公园。这里过去一度是犹太人的居住区，后来居住的多是在政府和律师事务所做事的黑人中产阶级。在快到华盛顿下城的地方，有一大片未经装修的公寓大楼，这里是华盛顿被遗忘的角落之一，虽不像东南面的安纳柯斯蒂亚那么贫穷所旧，但大人时代犯罪率和毒品买卖也不少。沃恩就在一幢公寓大楼里。\n　　戴维的敲门声换来了沃恩的一句冰冰的话：“门开着。”他小心地推开门，好像看到了一个旧书贮藏室。在一个暗淡的白炽灯的光亮下，到处是书，但没有任何书架，其它的东西，像桌子椅子之类都没有，书都乱堆在地上，把地板全盖住了。这里甚至连床都没有，只有一条毛毯铺在一堆稍加平整的书上。戴维走不进去，地上的书使他没法下脚。他远远地看了看那些书，除英文书籍外，他勉强看出还有许多法文和德文著作，甚至有破旧的拉丁文著作。他正好踏住的一本书是西塞罗的《罗马史》，往前点是《君主论》，作者名被一另书盖住了，那本书是威廉?曼彻斯特的《光荣与梦想》，还有让。雅克?塞尔旺的《世界面临挑战》，T?N?杜伊的《武器和战争的演变》，小阿瑟?施莱辛的《民主党史》，康德的《判断力批判》，K?N?斯皮琴科的《政治和军事地理学》，亨利?基辛格的《选择的必要》……\n　　沃恩刚才是坐在一堆书上，戴维推门时他站了起来并向门口走来，戴维看到他把一个透明的东西从左臂上拔下来，那是一支细小的注射器，沃恩似乎并不在乎被总统看见，他站在戴维面前时右手仍拿着那支注射器。\n　　“你吸毒？”戴维问。\n　　沃恩不说话，只是看着他，那双眼睛中伸出的无形怪手又向戴维掐过来，戴维有些害怕，他向四周看看，希望有个人，但这幢楼中空荡荡的，大人们不在后这样的空楼太多了。\n　　“我知道你不喜欢我，但你必须容忍我。”沃恩说。\n　　“容忍一个吸毒的国务卿？”\n　　“是的。”\n　　“为什么？”\n　　“为美国。”\n　　在沃恩那达斯?瓦德式的眼睛逼视下，（注：达斯?瓦德是美国孩子熟悉的科幻影片《星球大战》中的人物，他具有超人的能力，影片中曾出现他用眼睛发出力场，在远距离把人掐死的镜头。）戴维屈服了，他叹了口气，把目光移向别处，结束了同沃恩的对视。\n　　“我请你吃饭。”戴维说。\n　　“去白宫？”\n　　“是的。”\n　　沃恩点了点头\n######################\nOutput:",

笑得最开心的要数总统的小秘书贝纳了。\n　　被围在中间的总统脸上青一阵白一阵。其实戴维就是照照也绝对不次，说句实话：如果他是英国公民而不是美国总统的话，他是够那个候选人资格的。\n　　各国小首脑的耻笑固然令他不快，但他最恼火的还是格林。这几天来，在同北约各国首脑的一连串接触中，最令他不快的就是这个首相。他一到美国就向戴维要这要那，要钢铁，要石油，要的最多的还是武器，造价45亿美元的尼米兹级核动力航空母舰要三艘，造价20亿美元的三叉戟级核潜艇一下就要八艘，干脆就是想重建纳尔逊时代的帝国舰队。更可气的是，他还要地盘，开始只是要二次大战前的太平洋和中东地区的一些殖民地，后来竟搬出一卷十七世纪留下来的臭哄哄的牛皮地图，那地图上没有经纬线，南北极都是空的，美洲和非洲也是错误百出。格林指着那张地图告诉戴维，那时这儿是英国的那儿也是英国的，就差提独立战争前的北美洲了！他认为美国即使不能帮他们把这些全夺回来，至少也要让他们拿回相当一部分，像现在他们剩下的那一点点地方，同他们昔日对西方文明做出的贡献相比是极不相称的！大英联合王国在过去的两次大战中都是美国的神圣盟友，在上次大战中他们耗尽国力守住了英伦三岛，才没使德国鬼子渡过大西洋打到美国来，而他们却因此衰落到这种地步，现在，地球表面这块大饼要重新分了，美国有义务帮他们分到以前丢了的那些！但是，当戴维提出要求，待到条件成熟，北约将在英伦三岛上布置密集的中程战略导弹，以便为向东欧挺进作准备时，他立刻变得同大人们那会儿的铁女人首相一样硬，声称他的国家和整个西欧都不想变成核战场，新的导弹不但不能布置，原来有的也还要拆一些走……现在又发生了这样的事，他居然笑话起美国总统来了。就像一个以前挺阔现在破了产的绅士，还免不了要摆摆臭架子。想到这里戴维气不打一处来，挥起一拳打在格林的下巴上。\n　　身材细长的小首相正得意地端着那怀给戴维当镜子的酒，在突如其来的这一记猛击之下，从宴会桌上翻了过去。东厅大乱，孩子们围着戴维愤怒地大喊大叫起来，连大厅中的美国孩子都对他们总统的野蛮行径大为不满，军乐队的几个孩子把喇叭对着戴维乱吹一气。格林首相在别人的帮助下站了起来，他顾不得身上的鱼子酱和色拉，第一件事就是把弄歪了的领结扶正。把他拉起来的英国外务大臣是一个又粗又壮的男孩子，他猛向戴\n######################\nOutput:",

“是送给总统的一件礼物，还是我亲自去吧，不太远的。”大西说完，钻进汽车消失在夜色中。\n　　在白宫的蓝厅中，戴维总统紧张兴奋地来回踱着，他的脚踏在十九世纪中叶法国出产的深蓝色萨伏纳里地毯上，地毯正中织有一轮破云而出的椭圆形太阳，戴维不时站在那轮太阳上仰头思索。他之所以把同日本孩子的会晤一拖再拖，一是因为这次会晤极其重要，二是因为他自己没有把握。戴维想干某件事又自觉没把握的时候是很少的，但这就是一次。他知道，这次会晤将像大人们的雅尔塔会议一样至少决定以后半个世纪的历史，这是他所制定的美国征服世界庞大计划的第一步，也是最关键的一步。如果这一步成功，今后的美国将在通向地球霸主的道路上通行无阻；如果失败，美国将坐失良机，并陷入同后来崛起的其它强国无休无止的竞争之中，很难再有出头之日。\n　　当赫尔曼?戴维在将离人世的前总统面前，在最高法院首席法官面前，在星条旗下，把手放在圣经上念着上面的文字：“他们将把剑锻成犁，把长矛锻成剪树的勾剪”时，他是心不由衷的。他曾以一个和平小卫士的形像出现在超新星爆发后的孩子反核大军前，但即使在那时他也清楚地知道，美国要想真正利用这个宇宙或上帝赐予的千古良机，使星条旗成为地球的球旗，使纽约成为世界权力中心，道路可能有许多条，但最后都要通过一段必由之路——战争。作为超新星纪元开始时掌握了帝国主义世界最高权力的第一个孩子，戴维是有发动世界规模战争的魄力的；但做为一个小政治家，他有一种对于战争的本能的谨慎。这场必然要爆发的世界争夺战是一场人类历史上史无前例的孩子战争，这就决定了这场战争的残酷程度也是史无前例的。不错，历史上不乏有孩子参加的战争，从拿破仑时代的莱比锡战役到不久前的两伊战争，但那些战争是以大人为背景的，而且那些参战的孩子也比现在的孩子们大得多。戴维不是一个神经衰弱的孩子，战争的残酷和道义是不在他的考虑范围之内的，但他也不是一个鲁莽的孩子，从孩子的角度来衡量，他有着非凡的政治远见，否则不可能成为美利坚合众国的总统。他清楚一场孩子世界大战的复杂性，在这样的战争中如果稍有不慎，就会引火烧身，使美国面临灭顶之灾。\n　　贝纳打来电话，告诉他日本首相要过一会儿才能来。戴维使自己平静了一下，开始回忆起大人们的历史。\n　　对于这个突然到来的新世纪，很难从上几个世纪的历史中\n######################\nOutput:",

顶之灾。\n　　贝纳打来电话，告诉他日本首相要过一会儿才能来。戴维使自己平静了一下，开始回忆起大人们的历史。\n　　对于这个突然到来的新世纪，很难从上几个世纪的历史中得到什么直接的经验，但历史的启发总是有的。美国的顶峰是上次世界大战结束的时侯。在那次世界大战中美国成功的关键在于：利用大西洋和太平洋这两个难以逾越的天然屏障，使本土远离战争，使国家经济免遭战火破坏，并以这个强大的国家经济体系为后盾，在大洋对面的遥远战场上火中取粟。二次大战中，苏联伤亡人员达两千万，美国却只有区区四十五万；欧洲和亚洲在战火中变成一片废墟，而美国本土却远离各大战场，唯一能记起的直接战争破坏就是一艘航过广阔太平洋的胆大包天的日本潜艇向旧金山打了几炮，再就是几个从遥远的大洋对面顺风飘过来的日本妇女和孩子糊的纸气球，气球下面吊着燃烧弹，想引燃美国的森林。正因为如此，战争刚刚结束时的美国是唯一一个保留了完整的现代化工业体系的大国，这使它成为当时的世界宪兵，而照戴维的想法，如果那时罗斯福用另一场世界大战代替雅尔塔会议，一鼓作气把红色东方收拾掉，现在世界已经是美国的了。\n　　戴维现在已经明确了他要发动的战争有以下三个特点：\n　　一、快：首先是迅速发动，现在，世界刚从休克中苏醒，每个国家都处于摇摇晃晃立足未稳的状态，轻轻推一下就会重新倒下，根本经受不了一次大规模闪击战。另一方面，世界目前正处于迅速恢复的阶段，这不只是经济上的恢复，各国孩子们正在以前所未有的速度学习，严酷的现实将使他们的政治组织经验和军事组织经验迅速积累起来，他们每分钟都变得比上一分钟更老练更坚强更难对付。所以必须抓住时机，万万不可犹豫不决。从自身来说，即使是美国，现在也经不起半年以上的战争的消耗。\n　　二、狠：必须彻底摧毁战争目标的国家政治结构和经济结构，不择一切手段扑灭可能出现的抵抗，使其至少在半个世纪内无法恢复过来。\n　　三、也是最重要的一点：隔岸放火，使美国本土远离战争，不能让战火烧伤自己。\n　　戴维懊丧地发现，目前仅靠美国自身是难以实现以上计划的。不错，以前美国称雄世界，固然依靠它雄厚的国力，依靠它的钢铁，它的坦克飞机和超级舰队，但同时，也依靠一支高质量的军队。现在，美国还能在短时间内重建这样一支军队吗？戴维认为可能性不大。\n######################\nOutput:",

�然依靠它雄厚的国力，依靠它的钢铁，它的坦克飞机和超级舰队，但同时，也依靠一支高质量的军队。现在，美国还能在短时间内重建这样一支军队吗？戴维认为可能性不大。这一代美国孩子经历了核恐怖时代，他们是世界上最痛恨战争的孩子，他们认为战争是大人们生产出来的一个丑恶怪物。超新星爆发以后，当孩子们知道世界上只剩下自己时，都认为战争已随大人们而去，现在美国社会都在谈论百年和平和大同世界，简直成了一种公害。\n　　戴维想起了前两天的一件事：\n　　前一段时间，小总统尽了最大的努力来恢复美国陆海空三军，但事情进行不下去。他问国防部长是怎么回事，是不是征兵有些困难，部长回答说不是什么困难不困难，按国会新通过的征兵法根本征不到兵！戴维不相信美国孩子糟到了这种地步，就亲自拿着征兵广告到宪法大街上去散发。一下子围上来一大群男孩子，他们把征兵广告一抢而光，并且对总统庄严地宣布：为了合众国，他们愿意现在就入伍！是的，不回家了，现在他们已经是美国陆军的人了！总统当时高兴得眼泪都流下来了，让那些孩子跟着一位少将走，他是全国征兵委员会的负责人。他们说当然当然马上去跟他走，但我们在为国献身之前只有一个小小的要求，总统说提吧，绝对满足！他们说入伍可以，但自己的军衔不得低于五星上将！小总统目瞪口呆，说如果这样他们也只能是一群没有士兵的五星将军。他们说无所谓，只要穿带五颗金星的将军服，拿相应的薪金就行！总统说：五星上将是最高的军衔了，你们要是都成为五星将军，参谋长联会议主席和三军总司令怎么领导你们呢？他们说你可以授他们六星或七星上将嘛，星儿是取之不尽用不竭的！戴维说这里是征兵站，不是西点军校，这里只收士兵不要将军，我们将军已够多的了。那帮狗娘养的说去你的吧，一哄而散了。所以直到现在，美国军队还只有一帮扛着星星的光杆将军！\n　　当然，大人们时美国社会反战情绪之强烈在世界上也是少有的，但照样可以在越南和中东打仗，关键是时间问题。留给戴维的时间不会超过两个月，在这样短的时间内是难以产生出一支征服世界的超级军队的。\n　　于是戴维想到了日本孩子。\n　　在公元纪年的最后几年，人们普遍认为日本的最新一代已完全不同于他们的父辈和祖父辈，从两千六百年前的神武天皇时代传到今天的日本精神在他们身上消失了。现在的孩子们，再也不像他们的父辈那样坚忍和勤奋，他们没有父辈那样矮壮的身材的黄黑的皮\n######################\nOutput:",

日本航空自卫队的战斗机，相当于美国防卫其本土战斗机的总和。而且，九十年代大量引进的空中加油机，使F15J的作战半径扩大了一倍，使日本的空中战斗力远超过保卫本土的需要，跻身于空中强国的行列。\n　　那么这把利剑的在新星纪元的继承者是什么样的人呢？现在，日本孩子除了像别国的孩子一样努力恢复经济外，还在以惊人的速度组建军队，目前日本组建的孩子军队的数量尚不明确，但肯定大大超过了前自卫队的人数。这时的日本列岛已成了一座大兵营，到处都可以看见高唱着《拨刀曲》进行队列训练的男孩子，他们有的装备着真正的步兵轻武器，有的只是扛着木枪木棒，华华和小梦从电视中看到的那个雪仗场面就是其中之一。戴维从电视新闻中看到的一个场面更加惊人，那新闻是从太平洋上空的美国通讯卫星转发过来的。电视中首先出现了日本广岛的那尊著名的塑像。广岛曾有一个在核袭击中染上放射病的小女孩，在医院中经常叠纸鸢玩。一位女护士安慰她：当她叠够一千只纸鸢时，病就会好。女孩以后每天都埋头叠着一只又一只纸鸢，终于叠够了一千只，但她还是死了。后来在广岛立了一座塑像：一个女孩高举着一只大纸鸢。后来塑像的脚下经常有孩子们献上的纸鸢。现在，那些纸鸢堆得高高的，像女孩脚下的一堆洁白的雪。这情景戴维本来是熟悉的，但觉得那些纸鸢有些异样，仔细一看，那哪是什么纸鸢，是无数架纸叠的战斗机！不断有孩子把叠好的战斗机向塑像掷去，那些纸飞机像白色的幽灵一样在小女孩儿的周围上下翻飞，并在她脚下越堆越高，迟早要把她埋住……\n　　军国主义的幽灵已飞出了靖国神社，日本孩子不再甘心像爸爸妈妈们那样呆在那一串贫瘠的大岛之上，他们向世界复仇的战争已不可避免。\n　　日本孩子虽然令戴维心神不安，但说到底他并不怕同日本再打一次太平洋战争。如果日本孩子敢于向美国宣战，美国那庞大的战争机器将立刻开动起来，那些现在空谈和平的美国孩子将全力支持战争，就像六十多年前珍珠港事件发生时那样。戴维甚至想过诱使日本孩子进攻美国，以使美国孩子接受战争，从而达到急剧扩军的目的。他有把握打败日本孩子，自卫队留下来的装备固然不少，但同美军的武库相比就微不足道了。战端一开，美国孩子根本不需要像大人们六十年前那样同日本人在太平洋上苦战，只需\n######################\nOutput:",

人怎么也骂不过上亿个孩子。恶梦时期开始以后，他们俩几乎每天都在电视上出现，每天向全国的孩子们问侯一句：\n　　“喂，小朋友，你们怎么样了？”（小梦）或者：“喂，小猪们，怎么样了？”（华华）\n　　回答都一样：\n　　“活着呢，真讨厌！”\n　　话是这么说，但孩子们并不讨厌华华和小梦，如果他们哪天没出现，大家都觉得心神不定，互相问：今儿个电视上怎么没见那俩好孩子？“好孩子”这个称呼带着讽剌也带着善意，反正以后大家就这么称呼他们了。而华华和小梦每天听到一声“活着”，似乎心也多少放下了些，只要这声“活着”在，最可怕的事情就还没有在国土上发生。\n　　两个孩子不停地要求FG为眼前的困境想想办法，但超级电脑的回答每次都一样：国家正在按全体公民的意愿运行，它运行得很好，再没有比现在这么好的了。\n　　终于有一天早晨，华华和小梦在电视和广播中向全国孩子问候时，回答不再是令他们放心的“活着”了。\n　　“有点饿。”孩子们说。\n　　这样的回答只持续了三天，很快变成了：\n　　“我们饿！”\n　　最可怕的事情发生了，粮食，这维持人类社会生存的最基本物质，开始出现危机。\n　　粮食危机到来之快令信息大厦中的孩子们在惊恐之余有些不能理解，因为据FG提供的数字，大人们留下的粮食在数量上至少够三亿孩子吃一年的。危机提前到来的原因是多方面的，首先是因为国家的无组织状态，在粮食贮量大的地区孩子并不多，而在在孩子密集的城市粮食很快告急。这时尽管国土上仍有大量的存粮，但剩下的粮库离城市均有一定的距离。在铁路线上，堆满了被感应电流破坏的列车，沿路的信号装置和车站的各种设施也大部分被破坏，孩子们现在还不敢走近带电的铁轨，铁路运输在短时间内无法恢复。公路倒是完好无损，只是被大人们遗留的汽车堵得死了。其它国家的铁路和空中运输也大多处于瘫痪状态，但公路运输在这之前早已恢复。这件事即使对十岁左右的孩子来说也并不是太难，因为公路上阻塞的那些汽车大多是可以开动的，只需要良好的组织就可把路疏通，而中国孩子现在最缺的就是组织。城市的粮食危机发生后，有不少孩子曾做过疏通公路的努力，但这种努力是零散和无组织的，往往是前面清到路边的车又被后面的孩子开了上去，并由于驾驶技术不精重新把路堵死。所以到现在，除了少数中小城市外，绝大多数城市都被切断了动脉。\n　　同时，清明时节气候潮湿，孩子们从粮库中随意取粮时破坏了库中的各种设施，加上无人管理，造成粮食大量霉烂变质，\n######################\nOutput:",

��的影像，我自己现在也快站不住了。我想起了老师讲过的一个叫柳宗元的人不为五斗米折腰的故事，现在看来，只是因为那个老头还没饿到那个地步，同时他的家中也没有饿得哭不出声来的小妹妹……\n　　但这时我还抱着一个希望，希望有别的孩子带头走出那一步，但旁边的孩子都不吱声，我只好大声向已走远的“博士”喊道：\n　　“我同意！”\n　　由于紧张，我并没有把意思充分表达清楚，旁边的孩子们都莫名其妙地看着我，不知我想同意什么，但“博士”却立刻名明白了，在这点上我俩之间似乎存在着一种默契。\n　　“啊，你是说同意我当市长，是吗？！”\n　　我点点头。\n　　“好，从此以后你是我领导下的市民中的一员了，我将对你行使权力，现在请站到线的这一边来，同大家一起领米吧。”\n　　这时，我这边的小朋友们纷纷表示同意“博士”当市长。\n　　“啊，好好，好极了！”“博士”兴高彩烈地拍着手说，如果说他刚才还有些大人风度的话，现在却是一个地地道道的孩子了，一个全身心都充满了用弹弓打下一群麻雀后那种喜悦的孩子。\n　　“同意我当市长的小朋友都可以到线这面来领米！我再次声明，我们的城市是一个民主的城市，当你们中的任何人觉得我这个市长不好时，完全可以重新不选我嘛！不选我的手续很简单，只要把领到的米交回来就行了。”\n　　……\n　　我明白了一个很深的道理，虽然十几年后我才能用语言把它表达出来：当人民不占有生产资料和社会财富时，什么人权民主，全是空话。那天，当我把领到的米放到自行车上向家里走去时，觉得自己已变成了另外一个人，一个比来时的那个小姑娘长大了十岁的人。\n　　（选自《没路的路》，作者：方方，教育出版社，超新星纪元34年版）\n　　以上这类事情各大城市都在发生，那些首先使用暴力的孩子们不点自明地学会了恐怖和专制，而且学习速度快得惊人。他们在建立地方土匪政权时手段之老练策略之精明，即使是在大人时代也令人惊叹。其他大多数的孩子则发现，他们所幻想的那个想干什么就干什么的绝对自由的世界原来是一个恐怖的监狱，由于手中没有粮食，他们失去了最起码的自由和人权。后来的历史学家们在研究这段历史时还发现了一个很发人深思的现像：那些在家中受娇宠最多，得到的自由也最多的孩子，对小土匪们的专制政权的反抗力往往最小！大人们在的时侯，他们可以把一盘稍稍不合口味的饭扣到爸爸妈妈头上，现在，以取消一两天的粮食配给相威胁，他就可以出卖所有的亲人和朋友；拉他去旁观一场街头的死刑执行后，让他吃屎都会立刻照办……\n######################\nOutput:",

，到现在还在五岛列岛和济洲岛之间磨蹭，看来那些日本孩子是在航行中才学习怎么开船的。在日本本土，卫星判明的武装部队大约为三百万人，主要分布在东京到广岛长约五百六十公里的沿海平原地带。从装备上看能立即投入作战的部队大约为三十万人，其余的只是大群初步武装的孩子的集结，从泰山号卫星发回的高精度照片上看，大部分部队连每个士兵一只枪都配不齐。自从第一批四艘船向中国海岸开出之后，各大港口只零星开出一些小吨位船只，根本构不成第二支有打击力的舰队。在卫星的红外照片上，日本各港口的大吨位船只有三分之一处于高发热状态，这表示船内的发动机在试运行，但绝大部分没有离开锚位，少数勉强开动的大吨位船只也没有能真正出海，不是在港内相撞就是在港口外打转。显然，岛国上最有航海天才和技术能力的孩子都在第一支入侵舰队上，再开出大船来就没那么容易了。\n　　入夜，孩子政府发布了有关反击入侵的第三号国家命令：\n　　国家命令 第三号\n　　一、所有学校的领导人都立刻查看地图，如看到你们位于从丹东到福州之间的海边上（从地图的右边，靠日本，靠太平洋那边），就注意看命令的下文，若是位于别的地方就接着睡觉。\n　　二、大海边上那些地方的孩子立刻组织军队，军队的工作由各大队正副队长负责。\n　　三、九岁以上的少先队员都可以自愿参军，但只要男孩子。\n　　四、以少先队小队为基本战斗单位，以大队为独立战斗单位，师、军和集团军级别的战斗单位的组建将视各战斗大队的组建情况另行通知。各大队长随时同国家领导机关联系，报告你们那里已有多少兵力。\n　　五、军官暂只设战斗小队长、战斗中队长和战斗大队长三级，分别由少先队相应级别的干部担任。\n　　六、寻找武器，特别注意找大军火库，找到的所有军火库要由各大队武装人员日夜守卫。武器要由大队集中发放，不得自己随便拿去玩儿。\n　　七、学习使用武器，特别是大炮、坦克和装甲车之类的重武器，只要有战士能把一辆坦克开起来，就可以给他记一等功，能把飞机开起来的记特等功！这中间要注意安全！\n　　八、告诉所有战士：敌人已逼近我们的海岸，准备战斗！\n　　国家最高领导人：华华，小梦\n　　国防部长：赵锋\n\n　　五、终止战争\n\n　　赫尔曼?戴维从波托马克河中爬上岸，浑身打着冷战。五月的河水是十分寒冷的，这寒冷把小总统头脑中的烦燥和困倦一扫而光。这是五月七日的清晨，昨天晚上戴维一夜没睡，早晨到来时，他觉得自\n######################\nOutput:",

维没好气地说，同时拆开了电报。电报是日本首相大西文雄打来的。\n　　电文号C-239，十万火急。\n　　鉴于目前局势的突变，国会紧急商议，决定修改C计划，具体如下：\n　　一、贵国军援必须追加至我们所要求的数量，具体数量已在C-237号电文中说明。\n　　二、第一批攻击舰队停止前进，登陆时间推迟至三分之一军援抵达之时。\n　　三、美国在冲绳基地和横须贺基地的孩子们归日本三军参谋本部指挥，并以美军部队的名义直接参战。\n　　四、请协助密切监视中国核打击力量的动向，在得到中国核战略系统已完全瘫痪的确切证据之前，日本保留单方面中止战争的权力。\n　　绝密，原电无副本。\n　　总统哇哇大叫起来，贝纳不知他是高兴呢还是愤怒，当她搞清是后者时，吓得躲得远远的，她从未见过总统发这么大脾气。\n　　“妈的！他们原来不只是想多要些东西，还想把我们拖进战争！甚至……甚至还想到了核力量，哈哈，现在的，中国孩子的核力量！我以前一直认为太平洋那面的那群小矮子是新世界中的强者和英雄，现在，呸！一群地地道道的懦夫傻瓜小人！妈的！狗娘养的！”\n　　戴维破口大骂着，但渐渐冷静下来，开始认真思考现在的局势。显然，如果满足日本孩子的令人难以接受的条件，这场战争对美国来说就完全是一场灾难了。另外，电报中提到的核力量也使戴维吃了一惊，他发现自从得知那个大国发生的变化后，自己还没有考虑过那个国家大人们留下来的这种东西。同嘴上说的相反，总统并不认为日本孩子想到核弹有什么可笑，在那个已变得有政府有组织的大国中，孩子们部分或全部恢复核武器系统并不是完全没有可能，而他们使用它的忌讳比大人们少得多，这真让人不寒而栗。战争还没打，前景已很暗淡了。\n　　“我该怎么办？”在通向椭圆办公室的电梯上，戴维问自己，他有生以来还是第一次产生这个疑问。他突然有了一个寻找依靠的愿望，但谁能靠得上呢？那些孩子议员和孩子将军吗？那都是些把自己的工作当做好玩游戏的小白痴，成天只会夸夸其谈地炫耀自己，毫无用处。但有一个孩子是靠得上的，当戴维推开办公室大门时，他就在里面。\n　　切斯特?沃恩坐在办公桌后面总统的座位上，垂眼看着桌面，不知是在沉思还是在等待。\n　　“你怎么自己进来了？”戴维用不满的口气问，但内心并非如此。\n　　“很多的孩子都对这两个按钮感兴趣，”沃恩指着办公桌上一红一白两个方形按钮说。他几乎从未直接回答过别人的问话，仿佛不值得回答似的，\n######################\nOutput:",

�有人动起手来。但总统这时却从那乱糟糟的一群中钻了出来，大步向迎接他的中国孩子走来。\n　　华华对这群吵吵闹闹的美国孩子似乎没有多大兴趣，只是兴奋地打量着面前的“空军一号”。他从其他中国孩子中后退了好几步，以便把飞机看得更全些。\n　　弗雷德曼大使走到总统身边，要向他介绍华华，但没等大使开口，总统就穿过人群，径直走到后面的华华那儿，同他拥抱起来。其它的美国孩子停止了争吵，大吃一惊。要知道，来访的美国孩子谁也没见过这个国家的小首脑，连照片都没有见过，要是弄错了怎么办？但戴维这方面的眼力是有百分之百把握的，大家很快看到他没有弄错，都松了一口气。\n　　“中国小朋友欢迎你们！”华华对戴维说。\n　　“Very glad to see you when humanbeing history start again！”戴维说。\n　　“总统说，非常高兴在人类历史重新开始之际见到您。”小翻译向华华解释说。\n　　“谢谢，您的大飞机真漂亮！”华华指着戴维身后的“空军一号”说。\n　　“Where is great wall？（长城在哪儿？）”不等小眼镜翻译华华的话，戴维就问，同时向远处张望着。\n　　“Where are the pandas？（大熊猫在哪儿？）”贝纳也在旁边问，她以为一踏上中国的土地，就能像在美国到处看到小狗那样看到大熊猫。\n　　“You……your ，嗯，plane is very……very good。”华华用可笑的英语把自己刚才的意思又说了一遍，令自己惊奇的是，小学高年级的那点儿单词居然能把意思说明。\n　　“Oh，yes，yes，great wall and pandas are good too！”戴维连连点头，同时仍在看着远方寻找长城。\n　　“总统说长城和大熊猫也很好。”\n　　“我们用大熊猫换你的大飞机好吗？”华华问。\n　　“OK！”贝纳听完翻译后，没等总统回答就兴奋地大叫起来，\"One male and one female！（一只公的一只母的！）\"\n　　“闭嘴！小白痴，那我们怎么回去？”戴维瞪了贝纳一眼说，接着他又对华华说了一句意味深长的话：\n　　“用长城换好吗？啊，我们明天再谈吧，我们就是来换东西的，我们要换的东西你根本想像不到。”\n　　华华不太明白这话的意思。\n　　戴维向华华一一介绍随行的其他美国孩子，最后介绍的是三位驾驶“空军一号”的机组人员，他们是一名机长，一名导航员和一名随机工程师。美国孩子没有想到，华华给予了这三个孩子最热烈的欢迎，他握住那个穿空军上尉服装的小飞行员的手说：\n　　“我早想当飞行员了，如果你们是中国孩子，咱们换换算了。开着这样的飞机飞越大洋，这该有多棒！”\n　　“可是，阁下，您的工作比我们伟大得多。”上尉恭恭敬敬地说。\n　　“别提这三个笨蛋了，他们\n######################\nOutput:",

探险者一样，咬破狼的脖子喝进它的鲜血！而中国孩子认为，整个世界是为他准备的，当爸爸妈妈爷爷奶奶离去后，周围的一切仍会像他们那样是他的忠实奴朴，要什么就给他什么。我的顾问给我讲过一个中国历史上真正小皇帝的故事，那时正值大旱灾之年，一位大臣告诉这个小皇帝，皇宫外面饿死人了，小皇帝问那些人为什么被饿死，大臣回答说因为没粮食吃，小皇帝听后很是不解，问：没有粮食，那为什么不吃肉呢？现在中国孩子就是这种状态，你们没有自立的能力，只要有合适的环境，由你们这些孩子组成的国家很快就会全面崩溃！”戴维的话使中国孩子想起了刚刚过去的糖城时代，他们的心都沉了下来。\n　　“假如事情真想你说的那样，你们打算怎样怎样夺回美国呢？”华华问。\n　　“坦率地说，我们还没有一个具体的计划。但可以肯定，那时我们所面对的将是一个不设防的国家，我们的军队在东西海岸登陆时将不会遇到任何有力的抵抗，我们将轻而易举地拿回美国的一切。”\n　　“可在美国国土上的中国孩子怎么办呢？”小梦问。\n　　“有两种办法：其一是让他们返回中国国土，当然那时这片国土已经不是一个独立的国家，而是美国利坚合众国的亚洲部分了，至于能否成为美国公民，要看他们是否承认和服从合众国政府的统治。其二是仿照我们当年对付印第安人的办法：建立保留地。你们的人数很多，这个保留地不可能建在美国本土上，而应建在加拿大靠近北极圈的那片寒冷而广阔的地域上。保留地的经济将完全受美国政府制约，并禁止拥有除治安警察之外的任何武装力量。可能性最大的是两种方案同时进行：我们给中国孩子中那些有才华并忠诚于政府的科学家、工程师、艺术家等人材美国国籍，把其余的人送进保留地，至于那些企图重建国家的民族主义分子，我们会给他们找到更合适的地方的。”\n　　这时出现了会谈开始以来最长的一次沉默，华华和小梦，还有其他的中国孩子，互相用目光交谈，最后，华华问戴维：\n　　“关于交换的事，还有什么要对我们说的吗？”\n　　戴维用询问的目光看着沃恩，沃恩摇摇头，就像他刚才点头一样今人难以察觉。\n　　“没有了。”戴维说。\n　　“你们的意思我们懂了。”华华看着地面说。\n　　“谢谢！”戴维深深地鞠了一躬。\n　　“我们将很快做出答复。”\n　　“谢谢！”\n　　中美关于国土交换的第一次会谈就这样结束了。\n\n　　四、大地之子\n\n　　讨论国土交换的会议是在夜里开的，距中美第一次会谈只有三个小时。参加会议的有两位最高领导人和所有小部长。\n　　会议一开始，大部分孩子赞成交换，反对的只有两\n######################\nOutput:",

所以这很容易做到。大会开始后首先广播了中美会谈的新闻公报，大屏幕上立刻出现来自外界的一片欢呼声：\n　　“好！棒极了！”（91.239%的孩子执此看法。）\n　　“换了！换了！到美国去！那里是世界上最好玩的地方！”（93.104%的孩子执此看法）\n　　……\n　　交换就这样决定了。\n　　外交部长给美国孩子打了个电话，通知他们明天下午举行第二次会谈。然后小部长们都去休息了，中心大厅里只剩下华华和小梦。\n　　这时是深夜，玫瑰星云升了起来，大厅中透入一片蓝光。\n　　“看刚才孩子们的那样子，我又像回到前两个月了。”小梦忧心忡忡地说。\n　　华华坐在地板上，仰头看着窗外的玫瑰星云没有说话。\n　　“今天我肯定要梦见爸爸妈妈，要是他们问起我，我该怎么说呢？”小梦看着华华说。\n　　“他们会问什么？”\n　　“当然会问：你们为什么都要离开我们的土地呢？”\n　　……\n　　第二天下午，进行了中美第二次会谈。会谈的地点和参加者都同上次一样。\n　　华华问戴维：“你们上次提出的建议还有什么要修改的吗？”\n　　戴维摇摇头：“没有了。”\n　　“我们建议你们再好好考虑考虑。”\n　　“我们来中国以前就完全考虑好了！”\n　　“我们认为我们可以保住新的国土，并使它成为世界上最强大的国家！你们将永远失去美国！”\n　　“既然您这么认为，那就请您对我们的提议做最后的答复吧。在这个星球的两块大陆上，拳击台已经摆好，我们已经发出挑战，你们敢应战吗？”\n　　一双黑眼睛和一双蓝眼睛长久地对视着，空气似乎凝固了。最后，华华向戴维伸出手去：\n　　“换了！！”\n　　第二天，中美两国孩子举了第三次会谈，会谈的主要目的是讨论国土交换的细节，并正式签定交换协议。这次会谈在信息大厦举行，双方都有很多孩子参加。原来孩子们打算在这次会谈中把主要细节都确定下来。他们所讨论的毕竟是人类历史上规模最大的一项国际行动，其细节渺如烟海，会谈紧张地接连进行了三天，孩子们才发现，他们只能把交换计划的大概轮廓定下来，其它的细节问题只能在交换过程中解决了。改变了工作方法后，会谈又进行了四天，孩子们解决国际问题有他们自己的方式，在这种方式下，一些大人时代令那些国家首脑和外交家们望而生畏的问题，在孩子们手中都能轻松地解决，他们解决这些问题速度之快，会令大人时代最老练的外交家惊叹不已。在这历时一个星期的会谈中，所解决的问题抵得上一百个雅尔塔会议和波茨坦会议。最后，两国孩子签定了国土交换协议（又称超新星协议）\n　　超新星协议\n　　一、中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国决定交换两国全部国土。\n　　二、两国孩子分别\n######################\nOutput:",

图》模糊一片，但却有隐隐约约的喧闹声飞出来；立在大厅正中的一尊兵马俑发出蓝白色的荧光，不是孩子们向他走去，而是他向孩子们飘浮过来……两个孩子从最南面的近代部分开始，向北走去，走过了一间又一间的大厅，时间和历史在蓝光中从他们身边向后流去，随着时光的倒流，周围生命的涌动越来越强烈，他们踱过了一个个朝代，向远古走去。\n　　……\n　　这时，大移民已在两个大陆同时上开始。\n　　在首先交换的两块国土：陕西省和北达克它州上，孩子们正在以很快的速度迁出。他们乘陆上和空中交通工具前往沿海各大港口，来不及走的就暂时向相邻的省或州迁移。中美这两块国土的交接委员会已分别进入了对方的交换地域，监督着迁移的进行。小移民们正在两国的各大港口很快地聚集，越来越多的远洋船只也在向这些港口集结，这些船只从军舰到油轮，什么都有，它们的国籍除中国美国外，还来自世界其它国家，其中欧洲和日本最多。这个星球上两个最大的国家的孩子们的举动，使世界上的其他孩子目瞪口呆，继而又兴奋异常，这也确实是一件让人兴奋的事，使大家感到超新星后的世界确实不同于大人们的世界了。他们尽自己最大的力量支援这场人类历史上规模最大的洲际移民，纷纷派出刚刚能开动的船队驶往两国的各大港口。这样做的动机，就连他们自己也难以说清。在太平洋的两岸，几支庞大的远洋船队正在形成。但是到目前为止，陕西省和北达克它州的交换仪式还没有举行，两国的小移民也都还没有登上即将横渡太平洋的船。\n　　……\n　　在故宫的文物大厅中，华华和小梦已走到了最北面的上古时代厅，他微微叹了口气，对小梦说：“下午在机场我又同美国孩子谈了一遍，他们还是不答应。”\n　　华华指的是这样一件事：在第三次会谈以后，中美双方又接连召开了许多次讨论交换细节的会谈，在这些会谈中，中方多次提出：中国土地上的文物和古籍，特别是像故宫里存放的那类珍贵文物，同别的财产不一样，是爸爸妈妈爷爷奶奶绝对不允许我们丢掉的东西，在交换中，中国孩子应该把最珍贵的文物和古籍带走。美国孩子坚决拒绝了。戴维和他的随行人员很有谈判才能，他们很少直接说不，而是用种种让人感到不太难受的方式表达自己的反对意见。\n　　但在这件事上他们却一反常态，只要一听中国孩子有关文物和古籍的事，他们就一起站走身来连连摇头摆手，“NO！NO！”地嚷个没完。开始，中国孩子总觉得这是美国孩子小气，因为文物都是很值钱的，但后来发现完全不是这么回事。\n######################\nOutput:",

，只要一听中国孩子有关文物和古籍的事，他们就一起站走身来连连摇头摆手，“NO！NO！”地嚷个没完。开始，中国孩子总觉得这是美国孩子小气，因为文物都是很值钱的，但后来发现完全不是这么回事。如果允许中国孩子带走自己的文物，美国孩子也同样有这种权力。虽然只有二百多年历史的美国，除了一些印第安人的图腾艺术品以外，自己没有什么很古老的文物，但他们的类似大都会博物馆和这类地方，有大量从世界各地抢来买来的文物和艺术品，这些东西同样是价值连城的。另外，中国孩子还提出，按照所带走文物的价值，美国孩子可以从自己的国土上拿走价值相等的其它东西，但美国孩子还是一口回绝。在陕西省居民的迁移工作中，交换委员会中的美国孩子提出必须首先进入八十年代建成的陕西历史博物馆和兵马俑所在地，他们对这些地方的注意力远多于对飞机制造厂和航天基地。对于北京故宫博物馆和市图书馆中的文物古籍，他们都了解得惊人详细，他们可以毫不困难地拿出电脑输出的故宫文物清单。毫不夸张地说，他们对这些地方的了解胜于中国孩子。\n　　后来又发生了这样一件事：中方提出把一些既懂英语又通中文的美国孩子暂时留在美国（这多是些华裔美籍孩子），教中国孩子掌握英文。戴维答应了，但提出一个条件：美国的各大博物馆中现存有许多中国文物，特别是一些十九世纪的探险家从中国的西部沙漠中偷去的敦煌石窑的壁画和经卷，允许美国孩子把这些东西带走！他们称这是出于对中国文化的热爱，但这种热爱表现得多少有些过分。如果说以上的事情令中国孩子不解的话，在正在交换的国土上发生的一些事就更离奇了，以下是很有代表性的一件：\n　　我们是第一批离开故土的孩子，在前往连云港的三种交通工具中我选择了飞机。有几架运十飞机负责运送移民到港口，还有两架美国大力神运输机，本来是运载美方交换委员会成员的，按照协议现在也帮助运送移民。这些飞机的小飞行员都是刚刚学会飞行，特别是那些中国小飞行员，运十在他们手中像喝醉了酒似的！这种旅行的风险很大，但到新大陆去的急不可耐的心情使我顾不了那么多了。我所在小队的孩子们接到通知后，兴高彩烈地连夜收拾东西，神奇美好的未来像一朵花似地在我的想像中绽开。去机场前，为了拿几件衣服，我从学校（战争动员以来我们一直集体住在那里）回家一趟。进家以后，我还是高高兴兴的，但在我就要最后一次迈出门时，心一下子沉了下来，这感觉来得那样突然，令我不知所措。看着家里那熟悉的一切，在这里渡过的温暖的童年时�\n######################\nOutput:",

我把那株小草留下，那不属于移民旅行中的生活必需品，不在交换协议允许带走物品的范围之内。我和周围的孩子一听都火冒三丈。这帮家伙也太小气了，难道从爸爸妈妈的土地上带一棵小草作纪念都不行吗？真是缺德！我大喊大叫着：我非要带这株小草不可！非带不可！神气什么，至少现在，这儿还是中国的领土呢！美国孩子坚决不让步，大家吵了走来。一个男孩子，中方的交换委员，苦苦地劝我，要顾全大局，不要为了一棵小草影响整个迁移。\n　　大地通过机轮把微微的震动传了上来，像是妈妈的手在轻轻地拍着我们的后背。机内的每一个孩子都想把这一时光延长再延长，终于，随着机身微微一抖，震动消失了，孩子们同母亲土地的最后一丝联系中断了。我失声叫了一句“妈妈！”，其他的孩子也都哭着叫了起来。有人扯我的衣服，扭头一看是挨着我坐的一个八九岁的小女孩儿，她给我看两株小草，可能是进机场前拔的，也可能是刚才趁乱时拔的，她把其中的一株送给我，我就这样带着一株小草飞离了祖先的土地。以后在美洲那簸沛流离的生活中，那株小草时时陪伴着我。无数个深夜，在思乡的梦中醒来，总要看看那株小草，玫瑰星云的蓝光给她那早已枯黄的身躯又镀上了一层生命的绿色，这时，总是有一股暖流涌遍了我那已在劳累中麻木的身体，在爸爸妈妈从冥冥中传来的目光下，我那疲惫的心又唱起了童年的歌……\n　　（选自《寻根》，作者：费林林，纽约，超新星纪元27年版。）\n　　这样的事几乎贯穿了第一块国土交换的全过程，小草、树叶、花朵，甚至石子和泥土，只要中国孩子想带一点这类国土上最普通又最根本的东西做纪念时，美国孩子就惊恐万状，他们多次要求召开各种级别的会谈来讨论这个问题，并要中方做出保证禁止移民从这块土地上带走那些东西。他们解释说这样做是出于防疫需要，很多中国孩子都相信了。但至少华华和小梦，明白了美国孩子这样做的真正用意：\n　　他们要彻底割断中国孩子和故土的每一丝联系，使泰坦的双脚永远离开大地。\n　　六月七日，首批交换的两块国土都迁空了，在对方第一批移民到来之前，两块国土上分别举行了交接仪式。从这两个仪式上，可以清楚地看出两国孩子的不同之处。\n　　陕西省的交接仪式不是在省城，而是在一个村庄旁进行的，我们的四周，是沟沟壑壑的黄土山，祖祖辈辈的耕作在山上留下道道梯田。�\n######################\nOutput:",

出版社的运作方式也没有最基本的概念。第一个想法就是把它寄给杨潇。由于对科幻世界杂志命运的关注（当时它不叫这个名字），我很早就知道她这个人。自八十年代的那场灾难后，中国科幻当时正处于中世纪的状态，在市场上几乎销声匿迹，而她居然能够在这种环境下把这样一个杂志办下去，让我很惊奇，也很敬佩。当我在当地那个小小的邮局中把那厚厚的稿子寄出后（当时没有E-MAIL），心里其实不抱希望的，不是指出版的希望，仅是指得到回复的希望，没想到那么快就收到了回信，那封信写得十分热情，让我很感动。以后，稿子在杨潇那里放了有近一年的时间，这期间，她一直在做着联系出版的努力，还不时给我来信说明情况。记得在一封信中她是这样说的：“请你再等等，我不相信现在的弟妹们不喜欢看新世纪的文学！”后来，由于当时的环境等完全可以理解的原因，书没能出版。从退回的书稿那磨损的样子看，它一定经过了很多人的手。我同时还收到了覃白编辑的来信，他仔细看了全稿，并提出了中肯的意见。我同时期写的另一部科幻长篇《中国2185》也没能发表，以后也没有发表的可能了，因为叶永烈已在港台发表了一部题材构思与之相同的小说，预计将成为畅销书，据悉这本书还有可能在大陆出版。《超》在后来又投了几个出版社，反应全是一样：书稿很不错，但是不可能出。后来由于工作和一些其它的事分心，我便停止了《超》的写作和出版努力。  \n\n　　这一停就是十年。  \n\n　　直到二零零零年，在一次偶然的机会我又想起了这部书稿，发现竟然有出版的可能。拿出来后首先给了唐风，然后又给了姚海军，他们都为此做出了巨大的努力。我在送出稿子后曾告诉唐风，只想在较大的较为正式的出版社出书，但结果超出了我的预期，两个国内首屈一指的主流文学出版社——人民文学和作家出版社同时准备接受这本书。这之后，《超》又写了三稿。  \n\n　　第三稿与第二稿相比，已更新了一大半内容，弱化了其中的政治色彩，加强了科幻内容，并将《中国2185》中描写的以数字国土为基础的绝对民主社会移植进来，但已由乌托邦变成一场恶梦。第三稿中的战争描写内容比较丰富，但也很敏感，其中有侵略军将领瞻仰主席纪念堂和核弹摧毁北京的描写，我知道这些不会通过，只是抱着帽子高了不被砍一刀的想法。  \n\n　　第四稿主要修改战争部分，改变了战场的地点，同时使战争的形式更加科幻和怪异。这次修改固然是编辑的要求，但也是作者自己的愿望，这时我已意识到，科幻小说的过分现实化固然能赢来一时的关注，但肯定是短命的。第四稿的意境更加空灵，也更加科幻了，但现实的内核是存在的，这部小说\n######################\nOutput:", "completion":

flying!”其实现在才真正能体会到Time的fly。那时国内的科幻迷就如同星星之火一样稀少，在严冬的城市中的某个角度里，在一间没有暖气的小屋中，几名年轻人围在一个小火炉边，彻夜畅谈着美丽的科幻之梦……这就是凌晨所描述的那时的科幻迷世界。我曾给北京的一个科幻迷团体去信（星河是其中的一员），告诉他们可以到我这里来用电脑。现在大家可能会说我这人太小气，你是搞计算机的，给人家一台旧电脑不就行了吗？放到今天这当然很容易，但我们应该了解当时的电脑意味着什么：我当时用的是一台GW0520CH，内存512K（注意是K），硬盘20MB（注意是MB），加上那台3070C的针式打印机，价格是24900元。（这台机器后来做为一个轨道衡的监控计算机，居然连续不断电运行了8年！现在还能用，就是太沉了。）那时有个BB机是身份的象征，那时一个砖头那么大的手机要两万多块钱，它一个月的电话费一般打打也在两三千左右，而那时，我所在的这样一个相对来说高收入的行业，一个月的工资也就三百多，真是“Time is flying!”  \n\n　　本来，新生代的中国科幻是没有资格回忆过去的，我们根本就没有什么过去，但现在正是2002年的最后一夜，就容忍这种可笑的冲动\n######################\nOutput:", "completion":

\n\n　　本来，新生代的中国科幻是没有资格回忆过去的，我们根本就没有什么过去，但现在正是2002年的最后一夜，就容忍这种可笑的冲动冒一下头。我们这些六十年代出生的人可能是中国的第一代科幻迷，在我们之前，科幻先是与科普，后来又与主流文学溶为一体，并没有这个特殊的群体。在另一部长篇拙作《球状闪电》中，有这样一段话：“这是一个让人产生怀旧感的城市，那些有上千年历史的古城并不能使人产生这种感情，它们太旧了，旧得与你没有关系，旧得让人失去了感觉。但像这样年轻的城市，却使你想起一个刚刚逝去的时代，在那个时代你渡过了童年和少年，那是你自己的上古时代，你自已的公元前。”  \n\n　　十多年前，在一个个冬夜里，坐在那屏幕上只有黑白两色的电脑前，用DOS下的WORDSTAR一行行地写着《超新星纪元》，窗外只有太行山的寒风在呼啸，心里却感觉很温暖很快乐，虽然自己的小说发表的希望十分微薄，但对科幻事业却充满信心，有时写了一夜，看着从东方山谷中升起的太阳，感觉那就是科幻的象征。现在，当小说最后发表时，心里却有一种很凄凉的感觉。前一阵在网上看到过一张美国科幻迷聚会的照片，看着那一群四五十岁大叔大婶，国内的科幻人可能会对人家科幻的成人化露出羡幕之情，而我感觉到的只有心灰意冷。在那个曾令我们向往的科幻王国中，老的科幻迷在不断死去，新的却未见出生，这也是科幻文学的象征，科幻真的老了。或者更确切地说，是我们这一代科幻迷心中的科幻老了。新的科幻正在诞生，我们肯定会去读甚至去写那样的科幻，但它与我们这些中国第一代的科幻迷的那些美好的回忆已经没有太多的关系了。  \n\n　　现在是深夜十一点五十分，2002年只剩十分钟了。其实，任何事物都终有只剩十分钟的时候，除了2002年，还包括我们的生命，包括地球，太阳和整个宇宙，当然，也不可避免地包括我们这一代科幻迷心中的科幻。  \n\n　　祝中国科幻新年快乐。\n######################\nOutput:", "completion":
