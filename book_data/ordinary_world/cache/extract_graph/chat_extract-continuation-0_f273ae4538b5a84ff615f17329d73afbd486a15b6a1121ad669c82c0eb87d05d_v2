\n　　但是，那些几天来找不下活干的匠人，也屈尊愿去干小工活。这使得竞争激烈起来。 \n　　包工头立刻在匠人中间挑了两个身体最好的，叼黑卷烟的嘴角浮起了一丝笑意——今天占了个便宜，用小工钱招了两个大工！但其他几个匠人年纪有些大，他似乎不愿意要，接着便再瞅年轻一些的人，他手在少平肩膀上拍了拍，说：“你算上一个！”少平激动得心怦怦直跳，立刻返身回去拿自己的行李。 \n　　他和另外三个人跟着包工头过了大桥头，然后走过灯火通明的南北大街，一直向南关走去。一路上，他们这几个人连同包工头自己，很引人注目，在行人的眼里大概象刚释放回来的劳改犯一样。 \n　　他们几个被包工头引到南关一个半山坡上的主家，一人吃了两碗没菜的干米饭。吃完饭后，另外的三个人就在旁边的一个敞口子窑里住下了。包工头指着坡下另外一个敞口子窑对少平说：“那里还能挤一个人。你下去住！”少平于是背起行李，到坡下那个敞口子窑里去安身。 \n　　这住处和他在阳沟揽工时的一样，是个没有门窗的闲窑；里面的地上铺一层麦秸，十几个人的铺盖卷紧挨在一起。 \n　　少平进去的时候，所有的工匠都光身子穿个裤衩，围在一起张大嘴巴兴致勃勃地听一个人有声有色的讲什么。谁也没注意他的到来。 \n　　他把被褥展开，铺在窑口边上，疲倦地躺下了。躺下以后，他才注意到，窑里所有赤膊裸体的揽工汉，原来是围着一个四十来岁的匠人，听他说自己和一个女人的故事——这是揽工汉们永远的话题。 \n　　现在，说故事的人正说得起劲，听故事的人听得如痴似醉。一支蜡烛就在那群人中间的砖块上栽着，人们轮流把旱烟锅伸过去点烟。灯火一明一灭，照出一张张入迷忘情的面孔。只见说话的人手在自己粗壮的黑腿上拍了一巴掌，叫道：“啊呀，我的天！从南京到北京，哪个女人能比上这灵香俊？哼哼，咱们那山乡圪崂里自古养的是好女人！瞧，这灵香头发黑格油油，脸白格生生，眼花格弯弯，身材苗格条条，走起路来，就象那水漂莲花，风摆杨柳！” \n　　“咝……”所有的揽工汉都象牙疼似地倒吸了一口凉气。少平忍不住笑了，也不由把耳朵竖起来。 \n　　“嗬呀，你们还没见她那双手哩！嫩得呀，绵得呀，就象那凉粉一般……” \n　　“你捏过没？”有人插嘴问。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
