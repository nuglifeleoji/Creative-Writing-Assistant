One of them could die and yet remain alive in the other’s consciousness, every shared memory intact; they were that close. He found himself frightened by the timeless web of that closeness, broke his gaze away from her. The web contained gaps, he knew. His fear arose from the newest of those gaps. He felt their lives beginning to separate and wondered: How can I tell her of this thing which has happened only to me?\nHe peered out over the desert, seeing the deep shadows behind the barachans—those high, crescent-shaped migratory dunes which moved like waves around Arrakis. This was Kedem, the inner desert, and its dunes were rarely marked these days by the irregularities of a giant worm’s progress. Sunset drew bloody streaks over the dunes, imparting a fiery light to the shadow edges. A hawk falling from the crimson sky captured his awareness as it captured a rock partridge in flight.\nDirectly beneath him on the desert floor plants grew ina profusion of greens, watered by a qanat which flowed partly in the open, partly in covered tunnels. The water came from giant windtrap collectors behind him on the highest point of rock. The green flag of the Atreides flew openly there.\nWater and green.\nThe new symbols of Arrakis: water and green.\nA diamond-shaped oasis of planted dunes spread beneath his high perch, focusing his attention into sharp Fremen awareness. The bell call of a nightbird came from the cliff below him, and it amplified the sensation that he lived this moment out of a wild past.\nNous avons changé tout cela, he thought, falling easily into one of the ancient tongues which he and Ghanima employed in private. “We have altered all of that.” He sighed. Oublier je ne puis. “I cannot forget.”\nBeyond the oasis, he could see in this failing light the land Fremen called “The Emptiness”—the land where nothing\ngrows, the land never fertile. Water and the great ecological plan were changing that. There were places now on Arrakis where one could see the plush green velvet of forested hills. Forests on Arrakis! Some in the new generation found it difficult to imagine dunes beneath those undulant green hills. To such young eyes there was no shock value in seeing the flat foliage of rain trees. But Leto found himself thinking now in the Old Fremen manner, wary of change, fearful in the presence of the new.\nHe said: “The children tell me they seldom find sandtrout here near the surface anymore.”\n“What’s that supposed to indicate?” Ghanima asked. There was petulance in her tone.\n“Things are beginning to change very swiftly,” he said.\nAgain the bird chimed in the cliff, and night fell upon the desert as the hawk had fallen upon the partridge. Night often subjected him to an assault of memories—all of those inner lives clamoring for their moment. Ghanima didn’t object to this phenomenon in quite the way he did. She knew his disquiet, though, and he felt her hand touch his shoulder in sympathy.\nHe struck an angry chord from the baliset.\nHow could he tell her what was happening to him?\nWithin his head were wars, uncounted lives parceling out their ancient memories: violent accidents, love’s languor, the colors of many places and many faces... the buried sorrows and leaping joys of multitudes. He heard elegies to springs on planets which no longer existed, green dances and firelight, wails and halloos, a harvest of conversations without number.\nTheir assault was hardest to bear at nightfall in the open.\n“Shouldn’t we be going in?” she asked.\nHe shook his head, and she felt the movement, realizing at last that his troubles went deeper than she had suspected.\nWhy do I so often greet the night out here? he asked himself. He did not feel Ghanima withdraw her hand.\n“You know why you torment yourself this way,” she said.\nHe heard the gentle chiding in her voice. Yes, he knew. The answer lay there in his awareness, obvious: Because that great known-unknown within moves me like a wave. He felt the cresting of his past as though he rode a surfboard. He had his father’s time-spread memories of prescience Superimposed upon everything else, yet he wanted all of those pasts. He wanted them. And they were so very dangerous. He knew that completely now with this new thing which he would have to tell Ghanima.\nThe desert was beginning to glow under the rising light of First Moon. He stared out at the false immobility of sand furls reaching into infinity. To his left, in the near distance, lay The Attendant, a rock outcropping which sandblast winds had reduced to a low, sinuous shape like a dark worm striking through the dunes. Someday the rock beneath him would be cut down to such a shape and Sietch Tabr would be no more, except in the memories of someone like himself. He did not doubt that there would be someone like himself.\n“Why’re you staring at The Attendant?” Ghanima asked.\nHe shrugged. In defiance of their guardians’ orders, he and Ghanima often went to The Attendant. They had discovered a secret hiding place there, and Leto knew now why that place lured them.\nBeneath him, its distance foreshortened by darkness, an open stretch of qanat gleamed in moonlight; its surface rippled with movements of predator fish which Fremen always planted in their stored water to keep out the Ssandtrout.\n“I stand between fish and worm,” he murmured.\n“What?”\nHe repeated it louder.\nShe put a hand to her mouth, beginning to suspect the thing which moved him. Her father had acted thus; she had but to peer inward and compare.\nLeto shuddered. Memories which fastened him to places his flesh had never known presented him with answers to questions he had not asked. He saw relationships and unfolding events against a gigantic inner screen. The sandworm of Dune would not cross water; water poisoned it. Yet water had been known here in prehistoric times. White gypsum pans attested to bygone lakes and seas. Wells, deep-drilled, found water which sandtrout sealed off. As clearly as if he’d witnessed the events, he saw what had happened on this planet and it filled him with foreboding for the cataclysmic changes which human intervention was bringing.\nHis voice barely above a whisper, he said: “I know what happened, Ghanima.”\nShe bent close to him. “Yes?”\n“The sandtrout.. .”\nHe fell silent and she wondered why he kept referring to the haploid phase of the planet’s giant sandworm, but she dared not prod him.\n“The sandtrout,” he repeated, “was introduced here from some other place. This was a wet planet then. They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them. Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet... and they did it to survive. Ina planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase.”\n“The sandtrout?” She shook her head, not doubting him, but unwilling to search those depths where he gathered such information. And she thought: Sandtrout? Many times in this flesh and others had she played the childhood game, poling for sandtrout, teasing them into a thin glove membrane before taking them to the deathstill for their\nwater. It was difficult to think of this mindless little creature as a Shaper of enormous events.\nLeto nodded to himself. Fremen had always known to plant predator fish in their water cisterns. The haploid sandtrout actively resisted great accumulations of water near the planet’s surface; predators swam in that qanat below him. Their sandworm vector could handle small amounts of water—the amounts held in cellular bondage by human flesh, for example. But confronted by large bodies of water, their chemical factories went wild, exploded in the death-transformation which produced the dangerous melange concentrate, the ultimate awareness drug employed in a diluted fraction for the sietch orgy. That pure concentrate had taken Paul Muad’Dib through the walls of Time, deep into the well of dissolution which no other male had ever dared.\nGhanima sensed her brother trembling where he sat in front of her. “What have you done?” she demanded.\nBut he would not leave his own train of revelation. “Fewer sandtrout—the ecological transformation of the planet...”\n“They resist it, of course,” she said, and now she began to understand the fear in his voice, drawn into this thing against her will.\n“When the sandtrout go, so do all the worms,” he said. “The tribes must be warned.”\n“No more spice,” she said.\nWords merely touched high points of the system danger which they both saw hanging over human intrusion into Dune’s ancient relationships.\n“It’s the thing Alia knows,” he said. “It’s why she gloats.”\n“How can you be sure of that?”\n“I’m sure.”\nNow she knew for certain what disturbed him, and she felt the knowledge chill her.\n“The tribes won’t believe us if she denies it,” he said.\nHis statement went to the primary problem of their existence: What Fremen expected wisdom from a nine-year- old? Alia, growing farther and farther from her own inner sharing each day, played upon this.\n“We must convince Stilgar,” Ghanima said.\nAs one, their heads turned and they stared out over the moonlit desert. It was a different place now, changed by just a few moments of awareness. Human interplay with that environment had never been more apparent to them. They felt themselves as integral parts of a dynamic system held in delicately balanced order. The new outlook involved a real change of consciousness which flooded them with observations. As Liet-Kynes had said, the universe was a place of constant conversation between animal populations. The haploid sandtrout had spoken to them as human animals.\n“The tribes would understand a threat to water,” Leto said.\n“But it’s a threat to more than water. It’s a—” She fell silent, understanding the deeper meaning of his words. Water was the ultimate power symbol on Arrakis. At their roots Fremen remained special-application animals, desert Survivors, governance experts under conditions of stress. And as water became plentiful, a strange symbol transfer came over them even while they understood the old necessities.\n“You mean a threat to power,” she corrected him.\n“Of course.”\n“But will they believe us?”\n“If they see it happening, if they see the imbalance.”\n“Balance,” she said, and repeated her father’s words from long ago: “It’s what distinguishes a people from a mob.”\nHer words called up their father in him and he said: “Economics versus beauty—a story older than Sheba.” He sighed, looked over his shoulder at her. “I’m beginning to have prescient dreams, Ghani.”\nA sharp gasp escaped her.\nHe said: “When Stilgar told us our grandmother was delayed—| already knew that moment. Now my other dreams are suspect.”\n“Leto...” She shook her head, eyes damp. “It came later for our father. Don’t you think it might be—”\n“I’ve dreamed myself enclosed in armor and racing across the dunes,” he said. “And I’ve been to Jacurutu.”\n“Jacu...” She cleared her throat. “That old myth!”\n“A real place. Ghani! | must find this man they call The Preacher. | must find him and question him.”\n“You think he’s ... our father?”\n“Ask yourself that question.”\n“It'd be just like him,” she agreed, “but...”\n“| don’t like the things | know I'll do,” he said. “\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARRRAKIS<|>GEO<|>Arrakis is a desert planet with high, crescent-shaped migratory dunes called barachans, and it is undergoing ecological transformation with the introduction of water and greenery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEDEM<|>GEO<|>Kedem is the inner desert of Arrakis, characterized by deep shadows and rare markings from sandworms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIETCH TABR<|>GEO<|>Sietch Tabr is a Fremen settlement located on a rock outcropping, which will eventually be eroded by sandblast winds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ATTENDANT<|>GEO<|>The Attendant is a rock outcropping shaped by sandblast winds, resembling a dark worm striking through the dunes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PERSON<|>Ghanima is the twin sister of Leto, sharing a deep connection and memories with him, and is involved in the ecological and political changes on Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETO<|>PERSON<|>Leto is the twin brother of Ghanima, experiencing prescient dreams and memories of past lives, and is deeply involved in the ecological transformation of Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIA<|>PERSON<|>Alia is a political figure on Arrakis who is aware of the ecological threats but may not act to prevent them, and is growing distant from her inner self)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STILGAR<|>PERSON<|>Stilgar is a Fremen leader who must be convinced of the ecological threats to Arrakis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PREACHER<|>PERSON<|>The Preacher is a mysterious figure whom Leto believes may be their father, Paul Muad'Dib, and whom he seeks to question)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL MUAD'DIB<|>PERSON<|>Paul Muad'Dib is the father of Leto and Ghanima, who used the spice melange to see through time and is possibly alive as The Preacher)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIET-KYNES<|>PERSON<|>Liet-Kynes was a planetologist who spoke of the universe as a place of constant conversation between animal populations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION<|>EVENT<|>The ecological transformation of Arrakis involves the introduction of water and greenery, threatening the sandtrout and sandworms, and thus the spice melange)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE MELANGE<|>EVENT<|>Spice melange is a powerful awareness drug produced by sandworms, and its production is threatened by the ecological changes on Arrakis)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>GHANIMA<|>Leto and Ghanima are twins who share a deep connection and memories, and are working together to address the ecological threats to Arrakis<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ARRRAKIS<|>Leto is deeply involved in the ecological transformation of Arrakis and is concerned about the future of the planet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>ARRRAKIS<|>Ghanima is involved in the ecological and political changes on Arrakis and shares her brother's concerns<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>THE PREACHER<|>Leto believes The Preacher may be his father, Paul Muad'Dib, and seeks to question him<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ALIA<|>Leto is aware of Alia's knowledge of the ecological threats and her potential to deny them<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>ALIA<|>Ghanima is aware of Alia's growing distance from her inner self and her potential to deny the ecological threats<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>STILGAR<|>Leto must convince Stilgar of the ecological threats to Arrakis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>STILGAR<|>Ghanima must also convince Stilgar of the ecological threats to Arrakis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>PAUL MUAD'DIB<|>Leto is the son of Paul Muad'Dib and shares his prescient abilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>PAUL MUAD'DIB<|>Ghanima is the daughter of Paul Muad'Dib and shares his memories and abilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LETO<|>ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION<|>Leto is deeply involved in and concerned about the ecological transformation of Arrakis<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHANIMA<|>ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION<|>Ghanima is involved in and concerned about the ecological transformation of Arrakis<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRRAKIS<|>ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION<|>Arrakis is undergoing an ecological transformation with the introduction of water and greenery, threatening the sandtrout and sandworms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARRRAKIS<|>SPICE MELANGE<|>Arrakis is the source of the spice melange, which is threatened by the ecological changes<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
