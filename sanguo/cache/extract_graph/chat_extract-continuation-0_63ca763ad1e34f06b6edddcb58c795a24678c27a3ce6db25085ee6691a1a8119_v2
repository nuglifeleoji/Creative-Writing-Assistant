，不留一人。有人言杨阜劝韦康休降，可斩之，超曰：“此人守义，不可斩也。”复用杨阜为参军。阜荐梁宽、赵衢二人，超尽用为军官。\n\n    杨阜告马超曰：阜妻死于临洮，乞告两个月假，归葬其妻便回。马超从之。杨阜过历城，来见抚彝将军姜叙。叙与阜是姑表兄弟：叙之母是阜之姑，时年已八十二。当日，杨阜入姜叙内宅，拜见其姑，哭告曰：“阜守城不能保，主亡不能死，愧无面目见姑。马超叛君，妄杀郡守，一州士民，无不恨之。今吾兄坐据历城，竟无讨贼之心，此岂人臣之理乎？”言罢，泪流出血。叙母闻言，唤姜叙入，责之曰：“韦使君遇害，亦尔之罪也。”又谓阜曰：“汝既降人，且食其禄，何故又兴心讨之？”阜曰：“吾从贼者，欲留残生，与主报冤也。”叙曰：“马超英勇，急难图之。”阜曰：“有勇无谋，易图也。吾已暗约下梁宽、赵衢。兄若肯兴兵，二人必为内应。”叙母曰：“汝不早图，更待何时，谁不有死，死于忠义，死得其所也。勿以我为念。汝若不听义山之言，吾当先死，以绝汝念。”\n\n    叙乃与统兵校尉尹奉、赵昂商议。原来赵昂之子赵月，现随马超为裨将。赵昂当日应允，归见其妻王氏曰：“吾今日与姜叙、杨阜、尹奉一处商议，欲报韦康之仇。吾想子赵月现随马超，今若兴兵，超必先杀吾子，奈何？”其妻厉声曰：“雪君父之大耻，虽丧身亦不惜，何况一子乎！君若顾子而不行，吾当先死矣！”赵昂乃决。次日一同起兵。姜叙、杨阜屯历城，尹奉、赵昂屯祁山。王氏乃尽将首饰资帛，亲自往祁山军中，赏劳军士，以励其众。\n\n    马超闻姜叙、杨阜会合尹奉、赵昂举事，大怒，即将赵月斩之；令庞德、马岱尽起军马，杀奔历城来。姜叙、杨阜引兵出。两阵圆处，杨阜、姜叙衣白袍而出，大骂曰：“叛君无义之贼！”马超大怒，冲将过来，两军混战。姜叙、杨卓如何抵得马超，大败而走。马超驱兵赶来。背后喊声起处，尹奉、赵昂杀来。超急回时，两下夹攻，首尾不能相顾。正斗间，刺斜里大队军马杀来。原来是夏侯渊得了曹操军令，正领军来破马超。超如何当得三路军马，大败奔回。\n\n
