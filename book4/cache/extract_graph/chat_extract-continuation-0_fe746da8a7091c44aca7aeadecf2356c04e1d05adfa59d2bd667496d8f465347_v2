\n　　前几天他在公社开会时，听说治功派人把少安那个二流子姐夫拉到双水村劳教了，他听了心里倒有点高兴。他知道这事会让孙玉厚一家人乱成一团——让孙少安去发愁吧！他万万没想到，半路里杀出个他弟弟，把这事给平息了。唉，这个福军！管的事也太多了……田福堂一路走，一路想：既然现在这事已经平息了，徐主任又让他捎话放人，他就应该表现出“事情本来就应该这样处理”的高姿态来。他感谢徐主任让他回来传达这个让孙玉厚一家人高兴的指示。他甚至想，说不定这家人还会认为是他田福堂给公社做了工作，才让放王满银哩……。 \n　　现在，黑回绒缠绕的自行车驮着田福堂，已经到了罐子村。 \n　　他突然灵机一动：干脆让我上去先给少安他姐说一声，让她高兴一下。 \n　　他把自行车撑在罐子村的公路边，就上兰花家去了。罐子村谁家住什么地方他都熟悉。 \n　　当他走到兰花家门前，才发现门上吊把锁。 \n　　田福堂于是扫兴地转过身，背抄着手又回到了公路上。 \n　　他对自己不满意地摇了摇头。他本来就应该想到，满银一出事，兰花就肯定会跑到双水村她娘家的门上去了。另外，他对自己更不满意的是，他的行为看来似乎是向少安一家人邀功讨好一般！真是，他田福堂什么时候学得这么下贱？ \n　　他甚至有点面红耳赤地又骑上自行车，很快向双水村赶去。 \n　　他到了双水村村头，跳下车子，隔着东拉河向对面农田基建工地喊：“高虎！杨高虎！你过来一下！我有个事要给你说！” \n　　他没听见高虎应声，但看见孙玉亭从对面河畔的小路上转下来，淌过东拉河，过他这边来了。 \n　　玉亭过了河，一边从土坡往公路上走，一边问他：“公社的会完了？” \n　　他给玉亭“嗯”了一声。他看见玉亭还是那副样子，破棉袄襟子的两颗钮扣之间，别一卷子学习材料，两只烂鞋补钉缀补钉，想往快走，但为了将就那双鞋，两条腿绞在一起，急忙走不前来。田福堂被这位忠实助手的硒惶样子都快逗笑了。他想起他还有几双旧鞋，干脆送给玉亭去穿吧！孙玉亭上了公路，走到他面前，说：“高虎不在，带着枪到神仙山打山鸡去了……什么事？” \n　　田福堂说：“公社决定，叫把罐子村你那个侄女婿放了。徐主任有事，今天不回来，让我把这话捎给高虎和你……” \n　　孙玉亭听了十分高兴——这事情如此处理对他也是只有好处\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
