As an Amazon guard, Zia is responsible for carrying out Alia's orders, which include overseeing the preparation of Ghanima and managing the Temple guards. She also directs the guards under her command, acting as the superior of Buer Agarves.  \n\nZia's duties extend beyond the Temple, as she is occasionally assigned to escort high-profile individuals, such as Duncan Idaho, to locations like Tabr. Additionally, she serves as a resource provider for Buer Agarves' missions, capable of supplying fighting men and other necessary assets.  \n\nHer loyalty to Alia is unwavering, and she follows commands without question, demonstrating deep respect and concern for Alia's safety. Whether acting as a personal aide, a guard commander, or a tactical supporter, Zia plays a critical role in maintaining Alia's influence and security.  \n\nDespite the varying descriptions, all accounts agree on her Fremen heritage, her combat proficiency, and her subservience to Alia. The name \"Ziarenka\" appears to be an alternate or extended form of her name, further emphasizing her Fremen identity.
