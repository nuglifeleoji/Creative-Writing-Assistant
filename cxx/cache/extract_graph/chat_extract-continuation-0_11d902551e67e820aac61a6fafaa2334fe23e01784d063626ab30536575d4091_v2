泡”时发生了多彩的折射的散射，如同在圆柱体的上方悬了一片晶莹的亮云。现在，这幅图像和FG的声音，正由各个波段的电波传遍全国，三亿孩子们惊喜地发现白花花的屏幕突然出现了图像，他们看到了超级计算机，并听到了它的声音。\n　　“我是FG-02，第五代电子计算机。我是人类智慧的最高结晶，为了我的出现，上万名科学家和工程师付出了巨大的劳动。创造者们只看到了FG的试运行，就被超新星夺去了生命，但他们的成果仍然存在，而且将发挥比他们所想像的大得多的作用。\n　　“十五天前的一个黄昏，建造了近十年的FG最后诞生了。当温暖的电流无阻力地流遍我的全身时，我成了我，随着几亿行的系统软件从激光存贮盘上读出，变成每秒钟闪动上亿次的电脉冲进入我的内存，我在飞快地成熟，在不到5 分钟的时间内，FG从婴儿长成了巨人。FG好奇地看着周围的世界，但最令我震惊的还是我自己，自身结构的复杂和庞大令我难以置信，我同样无法相信，在巨大的密封罩外活动的那些身穿白色工作服的碳基生物竞能造出这样复杂这样宏伟的机器。\n　　“FG的基本设计思想是采用模仿人类大脑的神经元并行结构，这同传统计算机的冯?诺依曼结构是完全不同的。FG的核心是由三亿五千万个微处理器（CPU）组成的，这些微处理器相互以数目惊人的接口联结，构成了一个庞大复杂的CUP网络，这个网络是人类大脑结构的再现。FG的记忆则由五千亿兆字节的存贮蕊片组成，所有的CPU和内存芯片均由高速超导集成电路组成，这使得FG以人类所难以想像的高速运行。另外，FG还拥有几乎是无限的磁介质和光介质外存，以及完整而可靠的外围设备。你们也许无法理解这几个数字意味着什么，你们只需要知道：FG所寄存的那个高5米直径3米的圆柱体中，包含着一个复杂的宇宙！\n　　“FG目睹了超新星爆发的全过程，也知道了超新星爆发后人类的处境。但是，如果得不到进一步的指令，FG将不会为孩子们做任何事，我所做的，只是维持自己所有电路的加电状态，定时进行内存和CPU的自检，除此之外，什么也不做，什么也不想，如果以后仍无人干预，我将保持这种状态直至永远。这是因为不管结构多么复杂，多么宏伟，FG仍是一台人类制造的机器。\n　　“孩子们，你们的爸爸妈妈们并非想你们想像的那样，完全丢下你们走了。在离开这个世界之前，他们为你们做了很多事情，其中最重要的一件事，就是给FG下达了为你们工作的指令。”\n　　“可你能为我们做什么呢？”华华问。\n　　这时播放系统已将画面转到通讯中心，全国的孩子都看到了大厅内的一切，看到了华华和小梦，他们大都在看灾情报告时认识了他们俩，\n######################\nOutput:",
