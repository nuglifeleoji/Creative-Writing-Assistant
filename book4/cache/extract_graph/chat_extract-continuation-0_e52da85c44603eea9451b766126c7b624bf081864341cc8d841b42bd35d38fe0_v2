\n　　他把姐姐放在路边，自己八叉开双腿，象个强盗似地立在公路中央，准备硬行拦截从米家镇方向开过来的汽车。 \n　　当一辆卡车按着刺耳的喇叭开过来的时候，立在公路中央的孙少安拼命向司机招手。 \n　　汽车在离他几米远的地方停住了。司机的脑袋几乎撞在了挡风玻璃上；他脸色煞白跳出驾驶楼，二话没说就伸出手打了孙少安一记耳光，喝骂道：“你找死呀？”刚打了别人耳光的少安挨了一记耳光后，仍然站着没动，他眼里噙着泪水，指了指旁边的兰花对这位怒气冲冲的司机说：“我姐姐刚吃了老鼠药，求求师傅把我们捎到石圪节……” \n　　司机的脸色缓和下来——原来是这！他挥挥手，让少安赶快上车。 \n　　少安把姐姐扶进驾驶楼，汽车便飞一般向石圪节跑去。司机有点不好意思地对少安说：“刚才实在对不起……”少安下意识地摸了摸火辣辣的脸颊，说：“这没什么！我们还要感谢师傅呢！” \n　　这位打了人的师傅看来心肠不错，飞快地把汽车开到石圪节，并且绕路把少安姐弟俩一直送到公社医院的大门口。 \n　　少安来不及对司机说句感谢话，就引着姐姐赶快向急诊室跑去…… \n　　此时，在罐子村兰花家里，王满银已经从地上挣扎着爬起来。他在水瓮里舀了两马勺凉水，把满脸血迹洗掉；又拿笤帚把身上的面条归干净。他在墙上的破镜子里照了照自己的尊容，左脸肿得象个发面馍，院子里看热闹的大人都四散走了，留下一些娃娃嬉笑着挤在门口看他的狼狈相。 \n　　但王满银现在还顾不上疼痛，只是懊丧妻弟把他的财神爷打跑了！ \n　　自从在省城火车站结识了“南洋”来的干姐后，王满银一下子觉得自己时来运转。他带着这女人，在黄原自由市场上偷偷摸摸出售香港产的玩具手表，赚了好几百块钱。两个生意人马上也“麻糊”在了一起。他们白天转着卖表，晚上在东关私人开的旅馆里包一间房子，一个被窝里搂着睡觉。真他妈的，这日子过得比神仙都畅快！ \n　　在一块睡觉的时候，干姐才告诉他，这手表原价一只才几元钱！王满银吃惊之余心想，天下哪儿还有这么好的生意呢？两个人于是商量，这些表卖完后，他们一块到广州再多弄一些，然后返回\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
