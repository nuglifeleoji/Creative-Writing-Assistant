\n　　天气已经很冷了。他把那身深红色的绒衣穿在身上，外面仍套着那身做活的破衣裳，就赤手空拳出了门，来到大街上。他也没伞。就在屋檐下躲躲闪闪地走着；好在雨不大，星星点点的，不会把衣服淋个透湿。现在穿绒衣似乎太早，走一段路以后，身上便感到热烘烘的。他感到有点不自在——外衣的两个肩膀破烂不堪，里面的红绒衣暴露出来，特别扎眼。从这身新旧悬殊、不伦不类的衣服上，一眼就看出他是个地道的乡巴佬。 \n　　但少平放心的是，这里没有多少熟人。街上谁有兴趣注意这身有碍观瞻的穿戴呢？ \n　　他便尽量把那种别扭抛开，自由自在地在黄原街上逛荡。雨中的街道难得清静；稀稀落落的行人，脸都被雨伞遮挡着。 \n　　所有的商店都照常开门营业，但没有多少人光顾。少平不知不觉遛达到了南关，这里离地委不远的地方，有一座本城最大的影剧院，他很想去碰碰运气，看现在放不放电影。 \n　　他远远地看见，影剧院前面的街道上，拥挤着许多人。估计有电影！但不知是否能赶上场？ \n　　他加快脚步走到影剧院门口，迅速瞥了一眼大红油漆木牌，见上面写着《王子复仇记》。他高兴极了！这是根据莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》改编的电影，据上次金波说，为哈姆雷特配音的是孙道临，相当激动人心。 \n　　少平一看时间，知道还能赶上这一场，便慌忙挤到售票处。 \n　　他失望极了——这一场票已售完。 \n　　他于是垂头丧气退回到拥挤的人群里，看能不能钓个“鱼”。 \n　　他正在人群瞎挤，突然愣住了。他看见田晓霞穿件米色风雨衣，两手斜插在衣袋里，正在几步远的地方微笑着看他。他僵立在原地，脸顿时象火一般烫热。 \n　　她走过来，仍然微笑着，伸出手，说：“我以为这是在做梦。” \n　　“是……我也这样认为……”他握了握她的手。一阵难言的沉默。 \n　　“你现在是去看电影呢？还是到我家里去呢？”她掏出一张电影票递到他面前。 \n　　“不，你去看吧……我……”他的脸仍然象火烧一般。“我已经看过一次了……不过，如果你愿意的话，我建议你也别去看了，咱们到我家里去吧！”晓霞似乎故意表现出一种矜持的态度，但显然很难掩饰她的激动。 \n　　少平看见，晓霞已经完全是一副大学生的派头了，个码似乎也比中学高了许多。一头黑发散乱地披在肩头，上面沾着碎银屑似的水珠。合身的风\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>少平<|>PERSON<|>少平 is a character
